Note	1
The	1
book	1
cover	1
and	1
spine	1
above	1
and	1
the	1
images	1
which	1
follow	1
were	1
not	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
original	1
Ormsby	1
translation—they	1
are	1
taken	1
from	1
the	1
1880	1
edition	1
of	1
J.	1
W.	1
Clark,	1
illustrated	1
by	1
Gustave	1
Doré.	1
Clark	1
in	1
his	1
edition	1
states	1
that,	1
“The	1
English	1
text	1
of	1
‘Don	1
Quixote’	1
adopted	1
in	1
this	1
edition	1
is	1
that	1
of	1
Jarvis,	1
with	1
occasional	1
corrections	1
from	1
Motteaux.”	1
See	1
in	1
the	1
introduction	1
below	1
John	1
Ormsby’s	1
critique	1
of	1
both	1
the	1
Jarvis	1
and	1
Motteaux	1
translations.	1
It	1
has	1
been	1
elected	1
in	1
the	1
present	1
Project	1
Gutenberg	1
edition	1
to	1
attach	1
the	1
famous	1
engravings	1
of	1
Gustave	1
Doré	1
to	1
the	1
Ormsby	1
translation	1
instead	1
of	1
the	1
Jarvis/Motteaux.	1
The	1
detail	1
of	1
many	1
of	1
the	1
Doré	1
engravings	1
can	1
be	1
fully	1
appreciated	1
only	1
by	1
utilizing	1
the	1
“Full	1

button	1
to	1
expand	1
them	1
to	1
their	1
original	1
dimensions.	1
Ormsby	1
in	1
his	1
Preface	1
has	1
criticized	1
the	1
fanciful	1
nature	1
of	1
Doré’s	1
illustrations;	1
others	1
feel	1
these	1
woodcuts	1
and	1
steel	1
engravings	1
well	1
match	1
Quixote’s	1
dreams.	1

INTRODUCTION	1
PREFARATORY	1
It	1
was	1
with	1
considerable	1
reluctance	1
that	1
I	1
abandoned	1
in	1
favour	1
of	1
the	1
present	1
undertaking	1
what	1
had	1
long	1
been	1
a	1
favourite	1
project:	1
that	1
of	1
a	1
new	1
edition	1
of	1
Shelton’s	1
“Don	1
Quixote,”	1
which	1
has	1
now	1
become	1
a	1
somewhat	1
scarce	1
book.	1
There	1
are	1
some—and	1
I	1
confess	1
myself	1
to	1
be	1
one—for	1
whom	1
Shelton’s	1
racy	1
old	1
version,	1
with	1
all	1
its	1
defects,	1
has	1
a	1
charm	1
that	1
no	1
modern	1
translation,	1
however	1
skilful	1
or	1
correct,	1
could	1
possess.	1
Shelton	1
had	1
the	1
inestimable	1
advantage	1
of	1
belonging	1
to	1
the	1
same	1
generation	1
as	1
Cervantes;	1
“Don	1
Quixote”	1
had	1
to	1
him	1
a	1
vitality	1
that	1
only	1
a	1
contemporary	1
could	1
feel;	1
it	1
cost	1
him	1
no	1
dramatic	1
effort	1
to	1
see	1
things	1
as	1
Cervantes	1
saw	1
them;	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
anachronism	1
in	1
his	1
language;	1
he	1
put	1
the	1
Spanish	1
of	1
Cervantes	1
into	1
the	1
English	1
of	1
Shakespeare.	1
Shakespeare	1
himself	1
most	1
likely	1
knew	1
the	1
book;	1
he	1
may	1
have	1
carried	1
it	1
home	1
with	1
him	1
in	1
his	1
saddle-bags	1
to	1
Stratford	1
on	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
last	1
journeys,	1
and	1
under	1
the	1
mulberry	1
tree	1
at	1
New	1
Place	1
joined	1
hands	1
with	1
a	1
kindred	1
genius	1
in	1
its	1
pages.	1
But	1
it	1
was	1
soon	1
made	1
plain	1
to	1
me	1
that	1
to	1
hope	1
for	1
even	1
a	1
moderate	1
popularity	1
for	1
Shelton	1
was	1
vain.	1
His	1
fine	1
old	1
crusted	1
English	1
would,	1
no	1
doubt,	1
be	1
relished	1
by	1
a	1
minority,	1
but	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
only	1
by	1
a	1
minority.	1
His	1
warmest	1
admirers	1
must	1
admit	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
satisfactory	1
representative	1
of	1
Cervantes.	1
His	1
translation	1
of	1
the	1
First	1
Part	1
was	1
very	1
hastily	1
made	1
and	1
was	1
never	1
revised	1
by	1
him.	1
It	1
has	1
all	1
the	1
freshness	1
and	1
vigour,	1
but	1
also	1
a	1
full	1
measure	1
of	1
the	1
faults,	1
of	1
a	1
hasty	1
production.	1
It	1
is	1
often	1
very	1
literal—barbarously	1
literal	1
frequently—but	1
just	1
as	1
often	1
very	1
loose.	1
He	1
had	1
evidently	1
a	1
good	1
colloquial	1
knowledge	1
of	1
Spanish,	1
but	1
apparently	1
not	1
much	1
more.	1
It	1
never	1
seems	1
to	1
occur	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
the	1
same	1
translation	1
of	1
a	1
word	1
will	1
not	1
suit	1
in	1
every	1
case.	1
It	1
is	1
often	1
said	1
that	1
we	1
have	1
no	1
satisfactory	1
translation	1
of	1
“Don	1
Quixote.”	1
To	1
those	1
who	1
are	1
familiar	1
with	1
the	1
original,	1
it	1
savours	1
of	1
truism	1
or	1
platitude	1
to	1
say	1
so,	1
for	1
in	1
truth	1
there	1
can	1
be	1
no	1
thoroughly	1
satisfactory	1
translation	1
of	1
“Don	1
Quixote”	1
into	1
English	1
or	1
any	1
other	1
language.	1
It	1
is	1
not	1
that	1
the	1
Spanish	1
idioms	1
are	1
so	1
utterly	1
unmanageable,	1
or	1
that	1
the	1
untranslatable	1
words,	1
numerous	1
enough	1
no	1
doubt,	1
are	1
so	1
superabundant,	1
but	1
rather	1
that	1
the	1
sententious	1
terseness	1
to	1
which	1
the	1
humour	1
of	1
the	1
book	1
owes	1
its	1
flavour	1
is	1
peculiar	1
to	1
Spanish,	1
and	1
can	1
at	1
best	1
be	1
only	1
distantly	1
imitated	1
in	1
any	1
other	1
tongue.	1
The	1
history	1
of	1
our	1
English	1
translations	1
of	1
“Don	1
Quixote”	1
is	1
instructive.	1
Shelton’s,	1
the	1
first	1
in	1
any	1
language,	1
was	1
made,	1
apparently,	1
about	1
1608,	1
but	1
not	1
published	1
till	1
1612.	1
This	1
of	1
course	1
was	1
only	1
the	1
First	1
Part.	1
It	1
has	1
been	1
asserted	1
that	1
the	1
Second,	1
published	1
in	1
1620,	1
is	1
not	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
Shelton,	1
but	1
there	1
is	1
nothing	1
to	1
support	1
the	1
assertion	1
save	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
it	1
has	1
less	1
spirit,	1
less	1
of	1
what	1
we	1
generally	1
understand	1
by	1
“go,”	1
about	1
it	1
than	1
the	1
first,	1
which	1
would	1
be	1
only	1
natural	1
if	1
the	1
first	1
were	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
a	1
young	1
man	1
writing	1
_currente	1
calamo_,	1
and	1
the	1
second	1
that	1
of	1
a	1
middle-aged	1
man	1
writing	1
for	1
a	1
bookseller.	1
On	1
the	1
other	1
hand,	1
it	1
is	1
closer	1
and	1
more	1
literal,	1
the	1
style	1
is	1
the	1
same,	1
the	1
very	1
same	1
translations,	1
or	1
mistranslations,	1
occur	1
in	1
it,	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
extremely	1
unlikely	1
that	1
a	1
new	1
translator	1
would,	1
by	1
suppressing	1
his	1
name,	1
have	1
allowed	1
Shelton	1
to	1
carry	1
off	1
the	1
credit.	1
In	1
1687	1
John	1
Phillips,	1
Milton’s	1
nephew,	1
produced	1
a	1
“Don	1
Quixote”	1
“made	1
English,”	1
he	1
says,	1
“according	1
to	1
the	1
humour	1
of	1
our	1
modern	1
language.”	1
His	1
“Quixote”	1
is	1
not	1
so	1
much	1
a	1
translation	1
as	1
a	1
travesty,	1
and	1
a	1
travesty	1
that	1
for	1
coarseness,	1
vulgarity,	1
and	1
buffoonery	1
is	1
almost	1
unexampled	1
even	1
in	1
the	1
literature	1
of	1
that	1
day.	1
Ned	1
Ward’s	1
“Life	1
and	1
Notable	1
Adventures	1
of	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
merrily	1
translated	1
into	1
Hudibrastic	1
Verse”	1
(1700),	1
can	1
scarcely	1
be	1
reckoned	1
a	1
translation,	1
but	1
it	1
serves	1
to	1
show	1
the	1
light	1
in	1
which	1
“Don	1
Quixote”	1
was	1
regarded	1
at	1
the	1
time.	1
A	1
further	1
illustration	1
may	1
be	1
found	1
in	1
the	1
version	1
published	1
in	1
1712	1
by	1
Peter	1
Motteux,	1
who	1
had	1
then	1
recently	1
combined	1
tea-dealing	1
with	1
literature.	1
It	1
is	1
described	1
as	1
“translated	1
from	1
the	1
original	1
by	1
several	1
hands,”	1
but	1
if	1
so	1
all	1
Spanish	1
flavour	1
has	1
entirely	1
evaporated	1
under	1
the	1
manipulation	1
of	1
the	1
several	1
hands.	1
The	1
flavour	1
that	1
it	1
has,	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
hand,	1
is	1
distinctly	1
Franco-cockney.	1
Anyone	1
who	1
compares	1
it	1
carefully	1
with	1
the	1
original	1
will	1
have	1
little	1
doubt	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
concoction	1
from	1
Shelton	1
and	1
the	1
French	1
of	1
Filleau	1
de	1
Saint	1
Martin,	1
eked	1
out	1
by	1
borrowings	1
from	1
Phillips,	1
whose	1
mode	1
of	1
treatment	1
it	1
adopts.	1
It	1
is,	1
to	1
be	1
sure,	1
more	1
decent	1
and	1
decorous,	1
but	1
it	1
treats	1
“Don	1
Quixote”	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
fashion	1
as	1
a	1
comic	1
book	1
that	1
cannot	1
be	1
made	1
too	1
comic.	1
To	1
attempt	1
to	1
improve	1
the	1
humour	1
of	1
“Don	1
Quixote”	1
by	1
an	1
infusion	1
of	1
cockney	1
flippancy	1
and	1
facetiousness,	1
as	1
Motteux’s	1
operators	1
did,	1
is	1
not	1
merely	1
an	1
impertinence	1
like	1
larding	1
a	1
sirloin	1
of	1
prize	1
beef,	1
but	1
an	1
absolute	1
falsification	1
of	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
the	1
book,	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
proof	1
of	1
the	1
uncritical	1
way	1
in	1
which	1
“Don	1
Quixote”	1
is	1
generally	1
read	1
that	1
this	1
worse	1
than	1
worthless	1
translation—worthless	1
as	1
failing	1
to	1
represent,	1
worse	1
than	1
worthless	1
as	1
misrepresenting—should	1
have	1
been	1
favoured	1
as	1
it	1
has	1
been.	1
It	1
had	1
the	1
effect,	1
however,	1
of	1
bringing	1
out	1
a	1
translation	1
undertaken	1
and	1
executed	1
in	1
a	1
very	1
different	1
spirit,	1
that	1
of	1
Charles	1
Jervas,	1
the	1
portrait	1
painter,	1
and	1
friend	1
of	1
Pope,	1
Swift,	1
Arbuthnot,	1
and	1
Gay.	1
Jervas	1
has	1
been	1
allowed	1
little	1
credit	1
for	1
his	1
work,	1
indeed	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
said	1
none,	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
known	1
to	1
the	1
world	1
in	1
general	1
as	1
Jarvis’s.	1
It	1
was	1
not	1
published	1
until	1
after	1
his	1
death,	1
and	1
the	1
printers	1
gave	1
the	1
name	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
current	1
pronunciation	1
of	1
the	1
day.	1
It	1
has	1
been	1
the	1
most	1
freely	1
used	1
and	1
the	1
most	1
freely	1
abused	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
translations.	1
It	1
has	1
seen	1
far	1
more	1
editions	1
than	1
any	1
other,	1
it	1
is	1
admitted	1
on	1
all	1
hands	1
to	1
be	1
by	1
far	1
the	1
most	1
faithful,	1
and	1
yet	1
nobody	1
seems	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
good	1
word	1
to	1
say	1
for	1
it	1
or	1
for	1
its	1
author.	1
Jervas	1
no	1
doubt	1
prejudiced	1
readers	1
against	1
himself	1
in	1
his	1
preface,	1
where	1
among	1
many	1
true	1
words	1
about	1
Shelton,	1
Stevens,	1
and	1
Motteux,	1
he	1
rashly	1
and	1
unjustly	1
charges	1
Shelton	1
with	1
having	1
translated	1
not	1
from	1
the	1
Spanish,	1
but	1
from	1
the	1
Italian	1
version	1
of	1
Franciosini,	1
which	1
did	1
not	1
appear	1
until	1
ten	1
years	1
after	1
Shelton’s	1
first	1
volume.	1
A	1
suspicion	1
of	1
incompetence,	1
too,	1
seems	1
to	1
have	1
attached	1
to	1
him	1
because	1
he	1
was	1
by	1
profession	1
a	1
painter	1
and	1
a	1
mediocre	1
one	1
(though	1
he	1
has	1
given	1
us	1
the	1
best	1
portrait	1
we	1
have	1
of	1
Swift),	1
and	1
this	1
may	1
have	1
been	1
strengthened	1
by	1
Pope’s	1
remark	1
that	1
he	1
“translated	1
‘Don	1
Quixote’	1
without	1
understanding	1
Spanish.”	1
He	1
has	1
been	1
also	1
charged	1
with	1
borrowing	1
from	1
Shelton,	1
whom	1
he	1
disparaged.	1
It	1
is	1
true	1
that	1
in	1
a	1
few	1
difficult	1
or	1
obscure	1
passages	1
he	1
has	1
followed	1
Shelton,	1
and	1
gone	1
astray	1
with	1
him;	1
but	1
for	1
one	1
case	1
of	1
this	1
sort,	1
there	1
are	1
fifty	1
where	1
he	1
is	1
right	1
and	1
Shelton	1
wrong.	1
As	1
for	1
Pope’s	1
dictum,	1
anyone	1
who	1
examines	1
Jervas’s	1
version	1
carefully,	1
side	1
by	1
side	1
with	1
the	1
original,	1
will	1
see	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
sound	1
Spanish	1
scholar,	1
incomparably	1
a	1
better	1
one	1
than	1
Shelton,	1
except	1
perhaps	1
in	1
mere	1
colloquial	1
Spanish.	1
He	1
was,	1
in	1
fact,	1
an	1
honest,	1
faithful,	1
and	1
painstaking	1
translator,	1
and	1
he	1
has	1
left	1
a	1
version	1
which,	1
whatever	1
its	1
shortcomings	1
may	1
be,	1
is	1
singularly	1
free	1
from	1
errors	1
and	1
mistranslations.	1
The	1
charge	1
against	1
it	1
is	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
stiff,	1
dry—“wooden”	1
in	1
a	1
word,—and	1
no	1
one	1
can	1
deny	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
foundation	1
for	1
it.	1
But	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
pleaded	1
for	1
Jervas	1
that	1
a	1
good	1
deal	1
of	1
this	1
rigidity	1
is	1
due	1
to	1
his	1
abhorrence	1
of	1
the	1
light,	1
flippant,	1
jocose	1
style	1
of	1
his	1
predecessors.	1
He	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
few,	1
very	1
few,	1
translators	1
that	1
have	1
shown	1
any	1
apprehension	1
of	1
the	1
unsmiling	1
gravity	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
essence	1
of	1
Quixotic	1
humour;	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
a	1
crime	1
to	1
bring	1
Cervantes	1
forward	1
smirking	1
and	1
grinning	1
at	1
his	1
own	1
good	1
things,	1
and	1
to	1
this	1
may	1
be	1
attributed	1
in	1
a	1
great	1
measure	1
the	1
ascetic	1
abstinence	1
from	1
everything	1
savouring	1
of	1
liveliness	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
characteristic	1
of	1
his	1
translation.	1
In	1
most	1
modern	1
editions,	1
it	1
should	1
be	1
observed,	1
his	1
style	1
has	1
been	1
smoothed	1
and	1
smartened,	1
but	1
without	1
any	1
reference	1
to	1
the	1
original	1
Spanish,	1
so	1
that	1
if	1
he	1
has	1
been	1
made	1
to	1
read	1
more	1
agreeably	1
he	1
has	1
also	1
been	1
robbed	1
of	1
his	1
chief	1
merit	1
of	1
fidelity.	1
Smollett’s	1
version,	1
published	1
in	1
1755,	1
may	1
be	1
almost	1
counted	1
as	1
one	1
of	1
these.	1
At	1
any	1
rate	1
it	1
is	1
plain	1
that	1
in	1
its	1
construction	1
Jervas’s	1
translation	1
was	1
very	1
freely	1
drawn	1
upon,	1
and	1
very	1
little	1
or	1
probably	1
no	1
heed	1
given	1
to	1
the	1
original	1
Spanish.	1
The	1
later	1
translations	1
may	1
be	1
dismissed	1
in	1
a	1
few	1
words.	1
George	1
Kelly’s,	1
which	1
appeared	1
in	1
1769,	1
“printed	1
for	1
the	1
Translator,”	1
was	1
an	1
impudent	1
imposture,	1
being	1
nothing	1
more	1
than	1
Motteux’s	1
version	1
with	1
a	1
few	1
of	1
the	1
words,	1
here	1
and	1
there,	1
artfully	1
transposed;	1
Charles	1
Wilmot’s	1
(1774)	1
was	1
only	1
an	1
abridgment	1
like	1
Florian’s,	1
but	1
not	1
so	1
skilfully	1
executed;	1
and	1
the	1
version	1
published	1
by	1
Miss	1
Smirke	1
in	1
1818,	1
to	1
accompany	1
her	1
brother’s	1
plates,	1
was	1
merely	1
a	1
patchwork	1
production	1
made	1
out	1
of	1
former	1
translations.	1
On	1
the	1
latest,	1
Mr.	1
A.	1
J.	1
Duffield’s,	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
in	1
every	1
sense	1
of	1
the	1
word	1
impertinent	1
in	1
me	1
to	1
offer	1
an	1
opinion	1
here.	1
I	1
had	1
not	1
even	1
seen	1
it	1
when	1
the	1
present	1
undertaking	1
was	1
proposed	1
to	1
me,	1
and	1
since	1
then	1
I	1
may	1
say	1
vidi	1
tantum,	1
having	1
for	1
obvious	1
reasons	1
resisted	1
the	1
temptation	1
which	1
Mr.	1
Duffield’s	1
reputation	1
and	1
comely	1
volumes	1
hold	1
out	1
to	1
every	1
lover	1
of	1
Cervantes.	1
From	1
the	1
foregoing	1
history	1
of	1
our	1
translations	1
of	1
“Don	1
Quixote,”	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
seen	1
that	1
there	1
are	1
a	1
good	1
many	1
people	1
who,	1
provided	1
they	1
get	1
the	1
mere	1
narrative	1
with	1
its	1
full	1
complement	1
of	1
facts,	1
incidents,	1
and	1
adventures	1
served	1
up	1
to	1
them	1
in	1
a	1
form	1
that	1
amuses	1
them,	1
care	1
very	1
little	1
whether	1
that	1
form	1
is	1
the	1
one	1
in	1
which	1
Cervantes	1
originally	1
shaped	1
his	1
ideas.	1
On	1
the	1
other	1
hand,	1
it	1
is	1
clear	1
that	1
there	1
are	1
many	1
who	1
desire	1
to	1
have	1
not	1
merely	1
the	1
story	1
he	1
tells,	1
but	1
the	1
story	1
as	1
he	1
tells	1
it,	1
so	1
far	1
at	1
least	1
as	1
differences	1
of	1
idiom	1
and	1
circumstances	1
permit,	1
and	1
who	1
will	1
give	1
a	1
preference	1
to	1
the	1
conscientious	1
translator,	1
even	1
though	1
he	1
may	1
have	1
acquitted	1
himself	1
somewhat	1
awkwardly.	1
But	1
after	1
all	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
real	1
antagonism	1
between	1
the	1
two	1
classes;	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
reason	1
why	1
what	1
pleases	1
the	1
one	1
should	1
not	1
please	1
the	1
other,	1
or	1
why	1
a	1
translator	1
who	1
makes	1
it	1
his	1
aim	1
to	1
treat	1
“Don	1
Quixote”	1
with	1
the	1
respect	1
due	1
to	1
a	1
great	1
classic,	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
as	1
acceptable	1
even	1
to	1
the	1
careless	1
reader	1
as	1
the	1
one	1
who	1
treats	1
it	1
as	1
a	1
famous	1
old	1
jest-book.	1
It	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
question	1
of	1
caviare	1
to	1
the	1
general,	1
or,	1
if	1
it	1
is,	1
the	1
fault	1
rests	1
with	1
him	1
who	1
makes	1
so.	1
The	1
method	1
by	1
which	1
Cervantes	1
won	1
the	1
ear	1
of	1
the	1
Spanish	1
people	1
ought,	1
mutatis	1
mutandis,	1
to	1
be	1
equally	1
effective	1
with	1
the	1
great	1
majority	1
of	1
English	1
readers.	1
At	1
any	1
rate,	1
even	1
if	1
there	1
are	1
readers	1
to	1
whom	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
matter	1
of	1
indifference,	1
fidelity	1
to	1
the	1
method	1
is	1
as	1
much	1
a	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
translator’s	1
duty	1
as	1
fidelity	1
to	1
the	1
matter.	1
If	1
he	1
can	1
please	1
all	1
parties,	1
so	1
much	1
the	1
better;	1
but	1
his	1
first	1
duty	1
is	1
to	1
those	1
who	1
look	1
to	1
him	1
for	1
as	1
faithful	1
a	1
representation	1
of	1
his	1
author	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
in	1
his	1
power	1
to	1
give	1
them,	1
faithful	1
to	1
the	1
letter	1
so	1
long	1
as	1
fidelity	1
is	1
practicable,	1
faithful	1
to	1
the	1
spirit	1
so	1
far	1
as	1
he	1
can	1
make	1
it.	1
My	1
purpose	1
here	1
is	1
not	1
to	1
dogmatise	1
on	1
the	1
rules	1
of	1
translation,	1
but	1
to	1
indicate	1
those	1
I	1
have	1
followed,	1
or	1
at	1
least	1
tried	1
to	1
the	1
best	1
of	1
my	1
ability	1
to	1
follow,	1
in	1
the	1
present	1
instance.	1
One	1
which,	1
it	1
seems	1
to	1
me,	1
cannot	1
be	1
too	1
rigidly	1
followed	1
in	1
translating	1
“Don	1
Quixote,”	1
is	1
to	1
avoid	1
everything	1
that	1
savours	1
of	1
affectation.	1
The	1
book	1
itself	1
is,	1
indeed,	1
in	1
one	1
sense	1
a	1
protest	1
against	1
it,	1
and	1
no	1
man	1
abhorred	1
it	1
more	1
than	1
Cervantes.	1
For	1
this	1
reason,	1
I	1
think,	1
any	1
temptation	1
to	1
use	1
antiquated	1
or	1
obsolete	1
language	1
should	1
be	1
resisted.	1
It	1
is	1
after	1
all	1
an	1
affectation,	1
and	1
one	1
for	1
which	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
warrant	1
or	1
excuse.	1
Spanish	1
has	1
probably	1
undergone	1
less	1
change	1
since	1
the	1
seventeenth	1
century	1
than	1
any	1
language	1
in	1
Europe,	1
and	1
by	1
far	1
the	1
greater	1
and	1
certainly	1
the	1
best	1
part	1
of	1
“Don	1
Quixote”	1
differs	1
but	1
little	1
in	1
language	1
from	1
the	1
colloquial	1
Spanish	1
of	1
the	1
present	1
day.	1
Except	1
in	1
the	1
tales	1
and	1
Don	1
Quixote’s	1
speeches,	1
the	1
translator	1
who	1
uses	1
the	1
simplest	1
and	1
plainest	1
everyday	1
language	1
will	1
almost	1
always	1
be	1
the	1
one	1
who	1
approaches	1
nearest	1
to	1
the	1
original.	1
Seeing	1
that	1
the	1
story	1
of	1
“Don	1
Quixote”	1
and	1
all	1
its	1
characters	1
and	1
incidents	1
have	1
now	1
been	1
for	1
more	1
than	1
two	1
centuries	1
and	1
a	1
half	1
familiar	1
as	1
household	1
words	1
in	1
English	1
mouths,	1
it	1
seems	1
to	1
me	1
that	1
the	1
old	1
familiar	1
names	1
and	1
phrases	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
changed	1
without	1
good	1
reason.	1
Of	1
course	1
a	1
translator	1
who	1
holds	1
that	1
“Don	1
Quixote”	1
should	1
receive	1
the	1
treatment	1
a	1
great	1
classic	1
deserves,	1
will	1
feel	1
himself	1
bound	1
by	1
the	1
injunction	1
laid	1
upon	1
the	1
Morisco	1
in	1
Chap.	1
IX	1
not	1
to	1
omit	1
or	1
add	1
anything.	1
CERVANTES	1
Four	1
generations	1
had	1
laughed	1
over	1
“Don	1
Quixote”	1
before	1
it	1
occurred	1
to	1
anyone	1
to	1
ask,	1
who	1
and	1
what	1
manner	1
of	1
man	1
was	1
this	1
Miguel	1
de	1
Cervantes	1
Saavedra	1
whose	1
name	1
is	1
on	1
the	1
title-page;	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
too	1
late	1
for	1
a	1
satisfactory	1
answer	1
to	1
the	1
question	1
when	1
it	1
was	1
proposed	1
to	1
add	1
a	1
life	1
of	1
the	1
author	1
to	1
the	1
London	1
edition	1
published	1
at	1
Lord	1
Carteret’s	1
instance	1
in	1
1738.	1
All	1
traces	1
of	1
the	1
personality	1
of	1
Cervantes	1
had	1
by	1
that	1
time	1
disappeared.	1
Any	1
floating	1
traditions	1
that	1
may	1
once	1
have	1
existed,	1
transmitted	1
from	1
men	1
who	1
had	1
known	1
him,	1
had	1
long	1
since	1
died	1
out,	1
and	1
of	1
other	1
record	1
there	1
was	1
none;	1
for	1
the	1
sixteenth	1
and	1
seventeenth	1
centuries	1
were	1
incurious	1
as	1
to	1
“the	1
men	1
of	1
the	1
time,”	1
a	1
reproach	1
against	1
which	1
the	1
nineteenth	1
has,	1
at	1
any	1
rate,	1
secured	1
itself,	1
if	1
it	1
has	1
produced	1
no	1
Shakespeare	1
or	1
Cervantes.	1
All	1
that	1
Mayans	1
y	1
Siscar,	1
to	1
whom	1
the	1
task	1
was	1
entrusted,	1
or	1
any	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
followed	1
him,	1
Rios,	1
Pellicer,	1
or	1
Navarrete,	1
could	1
do	1
was	1
to	1
eke	1
out	1
the	1
few	1
allusions	1
Cervantes	1
makes	1
to	1
himself	1
in	1
his	1
various	1
prefaces	1
with	1
such	1
pieces	1
of	1
documentary	1
evidence	1
bearing	1
upon	1
his	1
life	1
as	1
they	1
could	1
find.	1
This,	1
however,	1
has	1
been	1
done	1
by	1
the	1
last-named	1
biographer	1
to	1
such	1
good	1
purpose	1
that	1
he	1
has	1
superseded	1
all	1
predecessors.	1
Thoroughness	1
is	1
the	1
chief	1
characteristic	1
of	1
Navarrete’s	1
work.	1
Besides	1
sifting,	1
testing,	1
and	1
methodising	1
with	1
rare	1
patience	1
and	1
judgment	1
what	1
had	1
been	1
previously	1
brought	1
to	1
light,	1
he	1
left,	1
as	1
the	1
saying	1
is,	1
no	1
stone	1
unturned	1
under	1
which	1
anything	1
to	1
illustrate	1
his	1
subject	1
might	1
possibly	1
be	1
found.	1
Navarrete	1
has	1
done	1
all	1
that	1
industry	1
and	1
acumen	1
could	1
do,	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
no	1
fault	1
of	1
his	1
if	1
he	1
has	1
not	1
given	1
us	1
what	1
we	1
want.	1
What	1
Hallam	1
says	1
of	1
Shakespeare	1
may	1
be	1
applied	1
to	1
the	1
almost	1
parallel	1
case	1
of	1
Cervantes:	1
“It	1
is	1
not	1
the	1
register	1
of	1
his	1
baptism,	1
or	1
the	1
draft	1
of	1
his	1
will,	1
or	1
the	1
orthography	1
of	1
his	1
name	1
that	1
we	1
seek;	1
no	1
letter	1
of	1
his	1
writing,	1
no	1
record	1
of	1
his	1
conversation,	1
no	1
character	1
of	1
him	1
drawn	1
...	1
by	1
a	1
contemporary	1
has	1
been	1
produced.”	1
It	1
is	1
only	1
natural,	1
therefore,	1
that	1
the	1
biographers	1
of	1
Cervantes,	1
forced	1
to	1
make	1
brick	1
without	1
straw,	1
should	1
have	1
recourse	1
largely	1
to	1
conjecture,	1
and	1
that	1
conjecture	1
should	1
in	1
some	1
instances	1
come	1
by	1
degrees	1
to	1
take	1
the	1
place	1
of	1
established	1
fact.	1
All	1
that	1
I	1
propose	1
to	1
do	1
here	1
is	1
to	1
separate	1
what	1
is	1
matter	1
of	1
fact	1
from	1
what	1
is	1
matter	1
of	1
conjecture,	1
and	1
leave	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
reader’s	1
judgment	1
to	1
decide	1
whether	1
the	1
data	1
justify	1
the	1
inference	1
or	1
not.	1
The	1
men	1
whose	1
names	1
by	1
common	1
consent	1
stand	1
in	1
the	1
front	1
rank	1
of	1
Spanish	1
literature,	1
Cervantes,	1
Lope	1
de	1
Vega,	1
Quevedo,	1
Calderon,	1
Garcilaso	1
de	1
la	1
Vega,	1
the	1
Mendozas,	1
Gongora,	1
were	1
all	1
men	1
of	1
ancient	1
families,	1
and,	1
curiously,	1
all,	1
except	1
the	1
last,	1
of	1
families	1
that	1
traced	1
their	1
origin	1
to	1
the	1
same	1
mountain	1
district	1
in	1
the	1
North	1
of	1
Spain.	1
The	1
family	1
of	1
Cervantes	1
is	1
commonly	1
said	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
of	1
Galician	1
origin,	1
and	1
unquestionably	1
it	1
was	1
in	1
possession	1
of	1
lands	1
in	1
Galicia	1
at	1
a	1
very	1
early	1
date;	1
but	1
I	1
think	1
the	1
balance	1
of	1
the	1
evidence	1
tends	1
to	1
show	1
that	1
the	1
“solar,”	1
the	1
original	1
site	1
of	1
the	1
family,	1
was	1
at	1
Cervatos	1
in	1
the	1
north-west	1
corner	1
of	1
Old	1
Castile,	1
close	1
to	1
the	1
junction	1
of	1
Castile,	1
Leon,	1
and	1
the	1
Asturias.	1
As	1
it	1
happens,	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
complete	1
history	1
of	1
the	1
Cervantes	1
family	1
from	1
the	1
tenth	1
century	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
seventeenth	1
extant	1
under	1
the	1
title	1
of	1
“Illustrious	1
Ancestry,	1
Glorious	1
Deeds,	1
and	1
Noble	1
Posterity	1
of	1
the	1
Famous	1
Nuno	1
Alfonso,	1
Alcaide	1
of	1
Toledo,”	1
written	1
in	1
1648	1
by	1
the	1
industrious	1
genealogist	1
Rodrigo	1
Mendez	1
Silva,	1
who	1
availed	1
himself	1
of	1
a	1
manuscript	1
genealogy	1
by	1
Juan	1
de	1
Mena,	1
the	1
poet	1
laureate	1
and	1
historiographer	1
of	1
John	1
II.	1
The	1
origin	1
of	1
the	1
name	1
Cervantes	1
is	1
curious.	1
Nuno	1
Alfonso	1
was	1
almost	1
as	1
distinguished	1
in	1
the	1
struggle	1
against	1
the	1
Moors	1
in	1
the	1
reign	1
of	1
Alfonso	1
VII	1
as	1
the	1
Cid	1
had	1
been	1
half	1
a	1
century	1
before	1
in	1
that	1
of	1
Alfonso	1
VI,	1
and	1
was	1
rewarded	1
by	1
divers	1
grants	1
of	1
land	1
in	1
the	1
neighbourhood	1
of	1
Toledo.	1
On	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
acquisitions,	1
about	1
two	1
leagues	1
from	1
the	1
city,	1
he	1
built	1
himself	1
a	1
castle	1
which	1
he	1
called	1
Cervatos,	1
because	1
“he	1
was	1
lord	1
of	1
the	1
solar	1
of	1
Cervatos	1
in	1
the	1
Montana,”	1
as	1
the	1
mountain	1
region	1
extending	1
from	1
the	1
Basque	1
Provinces	1
to	1
Leon	1
was	1
always	1
called.	1
At	1
his	1
death	1
in	1
battle	1
in	1
1143,	1
the	1
castle	1
passed	1
by	1
his	1
will	1
to	1
his	1
son	1
Alfonso	1
Munio,	1
who,	1
as	1
territorial	1
or	1
local	1
surnames	1
were	1
then	1
coming	1
into	1
vogue	1
in	1
place	1
of	1
the	1
simple	1
patronymic,	1
took	1
the	1
additional	1
name	1
of	1
Cervatos.	1
His	1
eldest	1
son	1
Pedro	1
succeeded	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
possession	1
of	1
the	1
castle,	1
and	1
followed	1
his	1
example	1
in	1
adopting	1
the	1
name,	1
an	1
assumption	1
at	1
which	1
the	1
younger	1
son,	1
Gonzalo,	1
seems	1
to	1
have	1
taken	1
umbrage.	1
Everyone	1
who	1
has	1
paid	1
even	1
a	1
flying	1
visit	1
to	1
Toledo	1
will	1
remember	1
the	1
ruined	1
castle	1
that	1
crowns	1
the	1
hill	1
above	1
the	1
spot	1
where	1
the	1
bridge	1
of	1
Alcántara	1
spans	1
the	1
gorge	1
of	1
the	1
Tagus,	1
and	1
with	1
its	1
broken	1
outline	1
and	1
crumbling	1
walls	1
makes	1
such	1
an	1
admirable	1
pendant	1
to	1
the	1
square	1
solid	1
Alcazar	1
towering	1
over	1
the	1
city	1
roofs	1
on	1
the	1
opposite	1
side.	1
It	1
was	1
built,	1
or	1
as	1
some	1
say	1
restored,	1
by	1
Alfonso	1
VI	1
shortly	1
after	1
his	1
occupation	1
of	1
Toledo	1
in	1
1085,	1
and	1
called	1
by	1
him	1
San	1
Servando	1
after	1
a	1
Spanish	1
martyr,	1
a	1
name	1
subsequently	1
modified	1
into	1
San	1
Servan	1
(in	1
which	1
form	1
it	1
appears	1
in	1
the	1
“Poem	1
of	1
the	1
Cid”),	1
San	1
Servantes,	1
and	1
San	1
Cervantes:	1
with	1
regard	1
to	1
which	1
last	1
the	1
“Handbook	1
for	1
Spain”	1
warns	1
its	1
readers	1
against	1
the	1
supposition	1
that	1
it	1
has	1
anything	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
the	1
author	1
of	1
“Don	1
Quixote.”	1
Ford,	1
as	1
all	1
know	1
who	1
have	1
taken	1
him	1
for	1
a	1
companion	1
and	1
counsellor	1
on	1
the	1
roads	1
of	1
Spain,	1
is	1
seldom	1
wrong	1
in	1
matters	1
of	1
literature	1
or	1
history.	1
In	1
this	1
instance,	1
however,	1
he	1
is	1
in	1
error.	1
It	1
has	1
everything	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
the	1
author	1
of	1
“Don	1
Quixote,”	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
in	1
fact	1
these	1
old	1
walls	1
that	1
have	1
given	1
to	1
Spain	1
the	1
name	1
she	1
is	1
proudest	1
of	1
to-day.	1
Gonzalo,	1
above	1
mentioned,	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
readily	1
conceived,	1
did	1
not	1
relish	1
the	1
appropriation	1
by	1
his	1
brother	1
of	1
a	1
name	1
to	1
which	1
he	1
himself	1
had	1
an	1
equal	1
right,	1
for	1
though	1
nominally	1
taken	1
from	1
the	1
castle,	1
it	1
was	1
in	1
reality	1
derived	1
from	1
the	1
ancient	1
territorial	1
possession	1
of	1
the	1
family,	1
and	1
as	1
a	1
set-off,	1
and	1
to	1
distinguish	1
himself	1
(diferenciarse)	1
from	1
his	1
brother,	1
he	1
took	1
as	1
a	1
surname	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
castle	1
on	1
the	1
bank	1
of	1
the	1
Tagus,	1
in	1
the	1
building	1
of	1
which,	1
according	1
to	1
a	1
family	1
tradition,	1
his	1
great-grandfather	1
had	1
a	1
share.	1
Both	1
brothers	1
founded	1
families.	1
The	1
Cervantes	1
branch	1
had	1
more	1
tenacity;	1
it	1
sent	1
offshoots	1
in	1
various	1
directions,	1
Andalusia,	1
Estremadura,	1
Galicia,	1
and	1
Portugal,	1
and	1
produced	1
a	1
goodly	1
line	1
of	1
men	1
distinguished	1
in	1
the	1
service	1
of	1
Church	1
and	1
State.	1
Gonzalo	1
himself,	1
and	1
apparently	1
a	1
son	1
of	1
his,	1
followed	1
Ferdinand	1
III	1
in	1
the	1
great	1
campaign	1
of	1
1236-48	1
that	1
gave	1
Cordova	1
and	1
Seville	1
to	1
Christian	1
Spain	1
and	1
penned	1
up	1
the	1
Moors	1
in	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
Granada,	1
and	1
his	1
descendants	1
intermarried	1
with	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
noblest	1
families	1
of	1
the	1
Peninsula	1
and	1
numbered	1
among	1
them	1
soldiers,	1
magistrates,	1
and	1
Church	1
dignitaries,	1
including	1
at	1
least	1
two	1
cardinal-archbishops.	1
Of	1
the	1
line	1
that	1
settled	1
in	1
Andalusia,	1
Deigo	1
de	1
Cervantes,	1
Commander	1
of	1
the	1
Order	1
of	1
Santiago,	1
married	1
Juana	1
Avellaneda,	1
daughter	1
of	1
Juan	1
Arias	1
de	1
Saavedra,	1
and	1
had	1
several	1
sons,	1
of	1
whom	1
one	1
was	1
Gonzalo	1
Gomez,	1
Corregidor	1
of	1
Jerez	1
and	1
ancestor	1
of	1
the	1
Mexican	1
and	1
Columbian	1
branches	1
of	1
the	1
family;	1
and	1
another,	1
Juan,	1
whose	1
son	1
Rodrigo	1
married	1
Doña	1
Leonor	1
de	1
Cortinas,	1
and	1
by	1
her	1
had	1
four	1
children,	1
Rodrigo,	1
Andrea,	1
Luisa,	1
and	1
Miguel,	1
our	1
author.	1
The	1
pedigree	1
of	1
Cervantes	1
is	1
not	1
without	1
its	1
bearing	1
on	1
“Don	1
Quixote.”	1
A	1
man	1
who	1
could	1
look	1
back	1
upon	1
an	1
ancestry	1
of	1
genuine	1
knights-errant	1
extending	1
from	1
well-nigh	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
Pelayo	1
to	1
the	1
siege	1
of	1
Granada	1
was	1
likely	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
strong	1
feeling	1
on	1
the	1
subject	1
of	1
the	1
sham	1
chivalry	1
of	1
the	1
romances.	1
It	1
gives	1
a	1
point,	1
too,	1
to	1
what	1
he	1
says	1
in	1
more	1
than	1
one	1
place	1
about	1
families	1
that	1
have	1
once	1
been	1
great	1
and	1
have	1
tapered	1
away	1
until	1
they	1
have	1
come	1
to	1
nothing,	1
like	1
a	1
pyramid.	1
It	1
was	1
the	1
case	1
of	1
his	1
own.	1
He	1
was	1
born	1
at	1
Alcalá	1
de	1
Henares	1
and	1
baptised	1
in	1
the	1
church	1
of	1
Santa	1
Maria	1
Mayor	1
on	1
the	1
9th	1
of	1
October,	1
1547.	1
Of	1
his	1
boyhood	1
and	1
youth	1
we	1
know	1
nothing,	1
unless	1
it	1
be	1
from	1
the	1
glimpse	1
he	1
gives	1
us	1
in	1
the	1
preface	1
to	1
his	1
“Comedies”	1
of	1
himself	1
as	1
a	1
boy	1
looking	1
on	1
with	1
delight	1
while	1
Lope	1
de	1
Rueda	1
and	1
his	1
company	1
set	1
up	1
their	1
rude	1
plank	1
stage	1
in	1
the	1
plaza	1
and	1
acted	1
the	1
rustic	1
farces	1
which	1
he	1
himself	1
afterwards	1
took	1
as	1
the	1
model	1
of	1
his	1
interludes.	1
This	1
first	1
glimpse,	1
however,	1
is	1
a	1
significant	1
one,	1
for	1
it	1
shows	1
the	1
early	1
development	1
of	1
that	1
love	1
of	1
the	1
drama	1
which	1
exercised	1
such	1
an	1
influence	1
on	1
his	1
life	1
and	1
seems	1
to	1
have	1
grown	1
stronger	1
as	1
he	1
grew	1
older,	1
and	1
of	1
which	1
this	1
very	1
preface,	1
written	1
only	1
a	1
few	1
months	1
before	1
his	1
death,	1
is	1
such	1
a	1
striking	1
proof.	1
He	1
gives	1
us	1
to	1
understand,	1
too,	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
great	1
reader	1
in	1
his	1
youth;	1
but	1
of	1
this	1
no	1
assurance	1
was	1
needed,	1
for	1
the	1
First	1
Part	1
of	1
“Don	1
Quixote”	1
alone	1
proves	1
a	1
vast	1
amount	1
of	1
miscellaneous	1
reading,	1
romances	1
of	1
chivalry,	1
ballads,	1
popular	1
poetry,	1
chronicles,	1
for	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
no	1
time	1
or	1
opportunity	1
except	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
twenty	1
years	1
of	1
his	1
life;	1
and	1
his	1
misquotations	1
and	1
mistakes	1
in	1
matters	1
of	1
detail	1
are	1
always,	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
noticed,	1
those	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
recalling	1
the	1
reading	1
of	1
his	1
boyhood.	1
Other	1
things	1
besides	1
the	1
drama	1
were	1
in	1
their	1
infancy	1
when	1
Cervantes	1
was	1
a	1
boy.	1
The	1
period	1
of	1
his	1
boyhood	1
was	1
in	1
every	1
way	1
a	1
transition	1
period	1
for	1
Spain.	1
The	1
old	1
chivalrous	1
Spain	1
had	1
passed	1
away.	1
The	1
new	1
Spain	1
was	1
the	1
mightiest	1
power	1
the	1
world	1
had	1
seen	1
since	1
the	1
Roman	1
Empire	1
and	1
it	1
had	1
not	1
yet	1
been	1
called	1
upon	1
to	1
pay	1
the	1
price	1
of	1
its	1
greatness.	1
By	1
the	1
policy	1
of	1
Ferdinand	1
and	1
Ximenez	1
the	1
sovereign	1
had	1
been	1
made	1
absolute,	1
and	1
the	1
Church	1
and	1
Inquisition	1
adroitly	1
adjusted	1
to	1
keep	1
him	1
so.	1
The	1
nobles,	1
who	1
had	1
always	1
resisted	1
absolutism	1
as	1
strenuously	1
as	1
they	1
had	1
fought	1
the	1
Moors,	1
had	1
been	1
divested	1
of	1
all	1
political	1
power,	1
a	1
like	1
fate	1
had	1
befallen	1
the	1
cities,	1
the	1
free	1
constitutions	1
of	1
Castile	1
and	1
Aragon	1
had	1
been	1
swept	1
away,	1
and	1
the	1
only	1
function	1
that	1
remained	1
to	1
the	1
Cortés	1
was	1
that	1
of	1
granting	1
money	1
at	1
the	1
King’s	1
dictation.	1
The	1
transition	1
extended	1
to	1
literature.	1
Men	1
who,	1
like	1
Garcilaso	1
de	1
la	1
Vega	1
and	1
Diego	1
Hurtado	1
de	1
Mendoza,	1
followed	1
the	1
Italian	1
wars,	1
had	1
brought	1
back	1
from	1
Italy	1
the	1
products	1
of	1
the	1
post-Renaissance	1
literature,	1
which	1
took	1
root	1
and	1
flourished	1
and	1
even	1
threatened	1
to	1
extinguish	1
the	1
native	1
growths.	1
Damon	1
and	1
Thyrsis,	1
Phyllis	1
and	1
Chloe	1
had	1
been	1
fairly	1
naturalised	1
in	1
Spain,	1
together	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
devices	1
of	1
pastoral	1
poetry	1
for	1
investing	1
with	1
an	1
air	1
of	1
novelty	1
the	1
idea	1
of	1
a	1
dispairing	1
shepherd	1
and	1
inflexible	1
shepherdess.	1
As	1
a	1
set-off	1
against	1
this,	1
the	1
old	1
historical	1
and	1
traditional	1
ballads,	1
and	1
the	1
true	1
pastorals,	1
the	1
songs	1
and	1
ballads	1
of	1
peasant	1
life,	1
were	1
being	1
collected	1
assiduously	1
and	1
printed	1
in	1
the	1
cancioneros	1
that	1
succeeded	1
one	1
another	1
with	1
increasing	1
rapidity.	1
But	1
the	1
most	1
notable	1
consequence,	1
perhaps,	1
of	1
the	1
spread	1
of	1
printing	1
was	1
the	1
flood	1
of	1
romances	1
of	1
chivalry	1
that	1
had	1
continued	1
to	1
pour	1
from	1
the	1
press	1
ever	1
since	1
Garci	1
Ordoñez	1
de	1
Montalvo	1
had	1
resuscitated	1
“Amadis	1
of	1
Gaul”	1
at	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
the	1
century.	1
For	1
a	1
youth	1
fond	1
of	1
reading,	1
solid	1
or	1
light,	1
there	1
could	1
have	1
been	1
no	1
better	1
spot	1
in	1
Spain	1
than	1
Alcalá	1
de	1
Henares	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
sixteenth	1
century.	1
It	1
was	1
then	1
a	1
busy,	1
populous	1
university	1
town,	1
something	1
more	1
than	1
the	1
enterprising	1
rival	1
of	1
Salamanca,	1
and	1
altogether	1
a	1
very	1
different	1
place	1
from	1
the	1
melancholy,	1
silent,	1
deserted	1
Alcalá	1
the	1
traveller	1
sees	1
now	1
as	1
he	1
goes	1
from	1
Madrid	1
to	1
Saragossa.	1
Theology	1
and	1
medicine	1
may	1
have	1
been	1
the	1
strong	1
points	1
of	1
the	1
university,	1
but	1
the	1
town	1
itself	1
seems	1
to	1
have	1
inclined	1
rather	1
to	1
the	1
humanities	1
and	1
light	1
literature,	1
and	1
as	1
a	1
producer	1
of	1
books	1
Alcalá	1
was	1
already	1
beginning	1
to	1
compete	1
with	1
the	1
older	1
presses	1
of	1
Toledo,	1
Burgos,	1
Salamanca	1
and	1
Seville.	1
A	1
pendant	1
to	1
the	1
picture	1
Cervantes	1
has	1
given	1
us	1
of	1
his	1
first	1
playgoings	1
might,	1
no	1
doubt,	1
have	1
been	1
often	1
seen	1
in	1
the	1
streets	1
of	1
Alcalá	1
at	1
that	1
time;	1
a	1
bright,	1
eager,	1
tawny-haired	1
boy	1
peering	1
into	1
a	1
book-shop	1
where	1
the	1
latest	1
volumes	1
lay	1
open	1
to	1
tempt	1
the	1
public,	1
wondering,	1
it	1
may	1
be,	1
what	1
that	1
little	1
book	1
with	1
the	1
woodcut	1
of	1
the	1
blind	1
beggar	1
and	1
his	1
boy,	1
that	1
called	1
itself	1
“Vida	1
de	1
Lazarillo	1
de	1
Tormes,	1
segunda	1
impresion,”	1
could	1
be	1
about;	1
or	1
with	1
eyes	1
brimming	1
over	1
with	1
merriment	1
gazing	1
at	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
preposterous	1
portraits	1
of	1
a	1
knight-errant	1
in	1
outrageous	1
panoply	1
and	1
plumes	1
with	1
which	1
the	1
publishers	1
of	1
chivalry	1
romances	1
loved	1
to	1
embellish	1
the	1
title-pages	1
of	1
their	1
folios.	1
If	1
the	1
boy	1
was	1
the	1
father	1
of	1
the	1
man,	1
the	1
sense	1
of	1
the	1
incongruous	1
that	1
was	1
strong	1
at	1
fifty	1
was	1
lively	1
at	1
ten,	1
and	1
some	1
such	1
reflections	1
as	1
these	1
may	1
have	1
been	1
the	1
true	1
genesis	1
of	1
“Don	1
Quixote.”	1
For	1
his	1
more	1
solid	1
education,	1
we	1
are	1
told,	1
he	1
went	1
to	1
Salamanca.	1
But	1
why	1
Rodrigo	1
de	1
Cervantes,	1
who	1
was	1
very	1
poor,	1
should	1
have	1
sent	1
his	1
son	1
to	1
a	1
university	1
a	1
hundred	1
and	1
fifty	1
miles	1
away	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
one	1
at	1
his	1
own	1
door,	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
puzzle,	1
if	1
we	1
had	1
any	1
reason	1
for	1
supposing	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
so.	1
The	1
only	1
evidence	1
is	1
a	1
vague	1
statement	1
by	1
Professor	1
Tomas	1
Gonzalez,	1
that	1
he	1
once	1
saw	1
an	1
old	1
entry	1
of	1
the	1
matriculation	1
of	1
a	1
Miguel	1
de	1
Cervantes.	1
This	1
does	1
not	1
appear	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
ever	1
seen	1
again;	1
but	1
even	1
if	1
it	1
had,	1
and	1
if	1
the	1
date	1
corresponded,	1
it	1
would	1
prove	1
nothing,	1
as	1
there	1
were	1
at	1
least	1
two	1
other	1
Miguels	1
born	1
about	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
century;	1
one	1
of	1
them,	1
moreover,	1
a	1
Cervantes	1
Saavedra,	1
a	1
cousin,	1
no	1
doubt,	1
who	1
was	1
a	1
source	1
of	1
great	1
embarrassment	1
to	1
the	1
biographers.	1
That	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
student	1
neither	1
at	1
Salamanca	1
nor	1
at	1
Alcalá	1
is	1
best	1
proved	1
by	1
his	1
own	1
works.	1
No	1
man	1
drew	1
more	1
largely	1
upon	1
experience	1
than	1
he	1
did,	1
and	1
he	1
has	1
nowhere	1
left	1
a	1
single	1
reminiscence	1
of	1
student	1
life—for	1
the	1
“Tia	1
Fingida,”	1
if	1
it	1
be	1
his,	1
is	1
not	1
one—nothing,	1
not	1
even	1
“a	1
college	1
joke,”	1
to	1
show	1
that	1
he	1
remembered	1
days	1
that	1
most	1
men	1
remember	1
best.	1
All	1
that	1
we	1
know	1
positively	1
about	1
his	1
education	1
is	1
that	1
Juan	1
Lopez	1
de	1
Hoyos,	1
a	1
professor	1
of	1
humanities	1
and	1
belles-lettres	1
of	1
some	1
eminence,	1
calls	1
him	1
his	1
“dear	1
and	1
beloved	1
pupil.”	1
This	1
was	1
in	1
a	1
little	1
collection	1
of	1
verses	1
by	1
different	1
hands	1
on	1
the	1
death	1
of	1
Isabel	1
de	1
Valois,	1
second	1
queen	1
of	1
Philip	1
II.,	1
published	1
by	1
the	1
professor	1
in	1
1569,	1
to	1
which	1
Cervantes	1
contributed	1
four	1
pieces,	1
including	1
an	1
elegy,	1
and	1
an	1
epitaph	1
in	1
the	1
form	1
of	1
a	1
sonnet.	1
It	1
is	1
only	1
by	1
a	1
rare	1
chance	1
that	1
a	1
“Lycidas”	1
finds	1
its	1
way	1
into	1
a	1
volume	1
of	1
this	1
sort,	1
and	1
Cervantes	1
was	1
no	1
Milton.	1
His	1
verses	1
are	1
no	1
worse	1
than	1
such	1
things	1
usually	1
are;	1
so	1
much,	1
at	1
least,	1
may	1
be	1
said	1
for	1
them.	1
By	1
the	1
time	1
the	1
book	1
appeared	1
he	1
had	1
left	1
Spain,	1
and,	1
as	1
fate	1
ordered	1
it,	1
for	1
twelve	1
years,	1
the	1
most	1
eventful	1
ones	1
of	1
his	1
life.	1
Giulio,	1
afterwards	1
Cardinal,	1
Acquaviva	1
had	1
been	1
sent	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
1568	1
to	1
Philip	1
II.	1
by	1
the	1
Pope	1
on	1
a	1
mission,	1
partly	1
of	1
condolence,	1
partly	1
political,	1
and	1
on	1
his	1
return	1
to	1
Rome,	1
which	1
was	1
somewhat	1
brusquely	1
expedited	1
by	1
the	1
King,	1
he	1
took	1
Cervantes	1
with	1
him	1
as	1
his	1
camarero	1
(chamberlain),	1
the	1
office	1
he	1
himself	1
held	1
in	1
the	1
Pope’s	1
household.	1
The	1
post	1
would	1
no	1
doubt	1
have	1
led	1
to	1
advancement	1
at	1
the	1
Papal	1
Court	1
had	1
Cervantes	1
retained	1
it,	1
but	1
in	1
the	1
summer	1
of	1
1570	1
he	1
resigned	1
it	1
and	1
enlisted	1
as	1
a	1
private	1
soldier	1
in	1
Captain	1
Diego	1
Urbina’s	1
company,	1
belonging	1
to	1
Don	1
Miguel	1
de	1
Moncada’s	1
regiment,	1
but	1
at	1
that	1
time	1
forming	1
a	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
command	1
of	1
Marc	1
Antony	1
Colonna.	1
What	1
impelled	1
him	1
to	1
this	1
step	1
we	1
know	1
not,	1
whether	1
it	1
was	1
distaste	1
for	1
the	1
career	1
before	1
him,	1
or	1
purely	1
military	1
enthusiasm.	1
It	1
may	1
well	1
have	1
been	1
the	1
latter,	1
for	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
stirring	1
time;	1
the	1
events,	1
however,	1
which	1
led	1
to	1
the	1
alliance	1
between	1
Spain,	1
Venice,	1
and	1
the	1
Pope,	1
against	1
the	1
common	1
enemy,	1
the	1
Porte,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
victory	1
of	1
the	1
combined	1
fleets	1
at	1
Lepanto,	1
belong	1
rather	1
to	1
the	1
history	1
of	1
Europe	1
than	1
to	1
the	1
life	1
of	1
Cervantes.	1
He	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
that	1
sailed	1
from	1
Messina,	1
in	1
September	1
1571,	1
under	1
the	1
command	1
of	1
Don	1
John	1
of	1
Austria;	1
but	1
on	1
the	1
morning	1
of	1
the	1
7th	1
of	1
October,	1
when	1
the	1
Turkish	1
fleet	1
was	1
sighted,	1
he	1
was	1
lying	1
below	1
ill	1
with	1
fever.	1
At	1
the	1
news	1
that	1
the	1
enemy	1
was	1
in	1
sight	1
he	1
rose,	1
and,	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
the	1
remonstrances	1
of	1
his	1
comrades	1
and	1
superiors,	1
insisted	1
on	1
taking	1
his	1
post,	1
saying	1
he	1
preferred	1
death	1
in	1
the	1
service	1
of	1
God	1
and	1
the	1
King	1
to	1
health.	1
His	1
galley,	1
the	1
_Marquesa_,	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
thick	1
of	1
the	1
fight,	1
and	1
before	1
it	1
was	1
over	1
he	1
had	1
received	1
three	1
gunshot	1
wounds,	1
two	1
in	1
the	1
breast	1
and	1
one	1
in	1
the	1
left	1
hand	1
or	1
arm.	1
On	1
the	1
morning	1
after	1
the	1
battle,	1
according	1
to	1
Navarrete,	1
he	1
had	1
an	1
interview	1
with	1
the	1
commander-in-chief,	1
Don	1
John,	1
who	1
was	1
making	1
a	1
personal	1
inspection	1
of	1
the	1
wounded,	1
one	1
result	1
of	1
which	1
was	1
an	1
addition	1
of	1
three	1
crowns	1
to	1
his	1
pay,	1
and	1
another,	1
apparently,	1
the	1
friendship	1
of	1
his	1
general.	1
How	1
severely	1
Cervantes	1
was	1
wounded	1
may	1
be	1
inferred	1
from	1
the	1
fact,	1
that	1
with	1
youth,	1
a	1
vigorous	1
frame,	1
and	1
as	1
cheerful	1
and	1
buoyant	1
a	1
temperament	1
as	1
ever	1
invalid	1
had,	1
he	1
was	1
seven	1
months	1
in	1
hospital	1
at	1
Messina	1
before	1
he	1
was	1
discharged.	1
He	1
came	1
out	1
with	1
his	1
left	1
hand	1
permanently	1
disabled;	1
he	1
had	1
lost	1
the	1
use	1
of	1
it,	1
as	1
Mercury	1
told	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
“Viaje	1
del	1
Parnaso”	1
for	1
the	1
greater	1
glory	1
of	1
the	1
right.	1
This,	1
however,	1
did	1
not	1
absolutely	1
unfit	1
him	1
for	1
service,	1
and	1
in	1
April	1
1572	1
he	1
joined	1
Manuel	1
Ponce	1
de	1
Leon’s	1
company	1
of	1
Lope	1
de	1
Figueroa’s	1
regiment,	1
in	1
which,	1
it	1
seems	1
probable,	1
his	1
brother	1
Rodrigo	1
was	1
serving,	1
and	1
shared	1
in	1
the	1
operations	1
of	1
the	1
next	1
three	1
years,	1
including	1
the	1
capture	1
of	1
the	1
Goletta	1
and	1
Tunis.	1
Taking	1
advantage	1
of	1
the	1
lull	1
which	1
followed	1
the	1
recapture	1
of	1
these	1
places	1
by	1
the	1
Turks,	1
he	1
obtained	1
leave	1
to	1
return	1
to	1
Spain,	1
and	1
sailed	1
from	1
Naples	1
in	1
September	1
1575	1
on	1
board	1
the	1
_Sun_	1
galley,	1
in	1
company	1
with	1
his	1
brother	1
Rodrigo,	1
Pedro	1
Carrillo	1
de	1
Quesada,	1
late	1
Governor	1
of	1
the	1
Goletta,	1
and	1
some	1
others,	1
and	1
furnished	1
with	1
letters	1
from	1
Don	1
John	1
of	1
Austria	1
and	1
the	1
Duke	1
of	1
Sesa,	1
the	1
Viceroy	1
of	1
Sicily,	1
recommending	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
King	1
for	1
the	1
command	1
of	1
a	1
company,	1
on	1
account	1
of	1
his	1
services;	1
a	1
_dono	1
infelice_	1
as	1
events	1
proved.	1
On	1
the	1
26th	1
they	1
fell	1
in	1
with	1
a	1
squadron	1
of	1
Algerine	1
galleys,	1
and	1
after	1
a	1
stout	1
resistance	1
were	1
overpowered	1
and	1
carried	1
into	1
Algiers.	1
By	1
means	1
of	1
a	1
ransomed	1
fellow-captive	1
the	1
brothers	1
contrived	1
to	1
inform	1
their	1
family	1
of	1
their	1
condition,	1
and	1
the	1
poor	1
people	1
at	1
Alcalá	1
at	1
once	1
strove	1
to	1
raise	1
the	1
ransom	1
money,	1
the	1
father	1
disposing	1
of	1
all	1
he	1
possessed,	1
and	1
the	1
two	1
sisters	1
giving	1
up	1
their	1
marriage	1
portions.	1
But	1
Dali	1
Mami	1
had	1
found	1
on	1
Cervantes	1
the	1
letters	1
addressed	1
to	1
the	1
King	1
by	1
Don	1
John	1
and	1
the	1
Duke	1
of	1
Sesa,	1
and,	1
concluding	1
that	1
his	1
prize	1
must	1
be	1
a	1
person	1
of	1
great	1
consequence,	1
when	1
the	1
money	1
came	1
he	1
refused	1
it	1
scornfully	1
as	1
being	1
altogether	1
insufficient.	1
The	1
owner	1
of	1
Rodrigo,	1
however,	1
was	1
more	1
easily	1
satisfied;	1
ransom	1
was	1
accepted	1
in	1
his	1
case,	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
arranged	1
between	1
the	1
brothers	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
return	1
to	1
Spain	1
and	1
procure	1
a	1
vessel	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
to	1
come	1
back	1
to	1
Algiers	1
and	1
take	1
off	1
Miguel	1
and	1
as	1
many	1
of	1
their	1
comrades	1
as	1
possible.	1
This	1
was	1
not	1
the	1
first	1
attempt	1
to	1
escape	1
that	1
Cervantes	1
had	1
made.	1
Soon	1
after	1
the	1
commencement	1
of	1
his	1
captivity	1
he	1
induced	1
several	1
of	1
his	1
companions	1
to	1
join	1
him	1
in	1
trying	1
to	1
reach	1
Oran,	1
then	1
a	1
Spanish	1
post,	1
on	1
foot;	1
but	1
after	1
the	1
first	1
day’s	1
journey,	1
the	1
Moor	1
who	1
had	1
agreed	1
to	1
act	1
as	1
their	1
guide	1
deserted	1
them,	1
and	1
they	1
had	1
no	1
choice	1
but	1
to	1
return.	1
The	1
second	1
attempt	1
was	1
more	1
disastrous.	1
In	1
a	1
garden	1
outside	1
the	1
city	1
on	1
the	1
sea-shore,	1
he	1
constructed,	1
with	1
the	1
help	1
of	1
the	1
gardener,	1
a	1
Spaniard,	1
a	1
hiding-place,	1
to	1
which	1
he	1
brought,	1
one	1
by	1
one,	1
fourteen	1
of	1
his	1
fellow-captives,	1
keeping	1
them	1
there	1
in	1
secrecy	1
for	1
several	1
months,	1
and	1
supplying	1
them	1
with	1
food	1
through	1
a	1
renegade	1
known	1
as	1
El	1
Dorador,	1
“the	1
Gilder.”	1
How	1
he,	1
a	1
captive	1
himself,	1
contrived	1
to	1
do	1
all	1
this,	1
is	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
mysteries	1
of	1
the	1
story.	1
Wild	1
as	1
the	1
project	1
may	1
appear,	1
it	1
was	1
very	1
nearly	1
successful.	1
The	1
vessel	1
procured	1
by	1
Rodrigo	1
made	1
its	1
appearance	1
off	1
the	1
coast,	1
and	1
under	1
cover	1
of	1
night	1
was	1
proceeding	1
to	1
take	1
off	1
the	1
refugees,	1
when	1
the	1
crew	1
were	1
alarmed	1
by	1
a	1
passing	1
fishing	1
boat,	1
and	1
beat	1
a	1
hasty	1
retreat.	1
On	1
renewing	1
the	1
attempt	1
shortly	1
afterwards,	1
they,	1
or	1
a	1
portion	1
of	1
them	1
at	1
least,	1
were	1
taken	1
prisoners,	1
and	1
just	1
as	1
the	1
poor	1
fellows	1
in	1
the	1
garden	1
were	1
exulting	1
in	1
the	1
thought	1
that	1
in	1
a	1
few	1
moments	1
more	1
freedom	1
would	1
be	1
within	1
their	1
grasp,	1
they	1
found	1
themselves	1
surrounded	1
by	1
Turkish	1
troops,	1
horse	1
and	1
foot.	1
The	1
Dorador	1
had	1
revealed	1
the	1
whole	1
scheme	1
to	1
the	1
Dey	1
Hassan.	1
When	1
Cervantes	1
saw	1
what	1
had	1
befallen	1
them,	1
he	1
charged	1
his	1
companions	1
to	1
lay	1
all	1
the	1
blame	1
upon	1
him,	1
and	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
being	1
bound	1
he	1
declared	1
aloud	1
that	1
the	1
whole	1
plot	1
was	1
of	1
his	1
contriving,	1
and	1
that	1
nobody	1
else	1
had	1
any	1
share	1
in	1
it.	1
Brought	1
before	1
the	1
Dey,	1
he	1
said	1
the	1
same.	1
He	1
was	1
threatened	1
with	1
impalement	1
and	1
with	1
torture;	1
and	1
as	1
cutting	1
off	1
ears	1
and	1
noses	1
were	1
playful	1
freaks	1
with	1
the	1
Algerines,	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
conceived	1
what	1
their	1
tortures	1
were	1
like;	1
but	1
nothing	1
could	1
make	1
him	1
swerve	1
from	1
his	1
original	1
statement	1
that	1
he	1
and	1
he	1
alone	1
was	1
responsible.	1
The	1
upshot	1
was	1
that	1
the	1
unhappy	1
gardener	1
was	1
hanged	1
by	1
his	1
master,	1
and	1
the	1
prisoners	1
taken	1
possession	1
of	1
by	1
the	1
Dey,	1
who,	1
however,	1
afterwards	1
restored	1
most	1
of	1
them	1
to	1
their	1
masters,	1
but	1
kept	1
Cervantes,	1
paying	1
Dali	1
Mami	1
500	1
crowns	1
for	1
him.	1
He	1
felt,	1
no	1
doubt,	1
that	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
such	1
resource,	1
energy,	1
and	1
daring,	1
was	1
too	1
dangerous	1
a	1
piece	1
of	1
property	1
to	1
be	1
left	1
in	1
private	1
hands;	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
him	1
heavily	1
ironed	1
and	1
lodged	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
prison.	1
If	1
he	1
thought	1
that	1
by	1
these	1
means	1
he	1
could	1
break	1
the	1
spirit	1
or	1
shake	1
the	1
resolution	1
of	1
his	1
prisoner,	1
he	1
was	1
soon	1
undeceived,	1
for	1
Cervantes	1
contrived	1
before	1
long	1
to	1
despatch	1
a	1
letter	1
to	1
the	1
Governor	1
of	1
Oran,	1
entreating	1
him	1
to	1
send	1
him	1
someone	1
that	1
could	1
be	1
trusted,	1
to	1
enable	1
him	1
and	1
three	1
other	1
gentlemen,	1
fellow-captives	1
of	1
his,	1
to	1
make	1
their	1
escape;	1
intending	1
evidently	1
to	1
renew	1
his	1
first	1
attempt	1
with	1
a	1
more	1
trustworthy	1
guide.	1
Unfortunately	1
the	1
Moor	1
who	1
carried	1
the	1
letter	1
was	1
stopped	1
just	1
outside	1
Oran,	1
and	1
the	1
letter	1
being	1
found	1
upon	1
him,	1
he	1
was	1
sent	1
back	1
to	1
Algiers,	1
where	1
by	1
the	1
order	1
of	1
the	1
Dey	1
he	1
was	1
promptly	1
impaled	1
as	1
a	1
warning	1
to	1
others,	1
while	1
Cervantes	1
was	1
condemned	1
to	1
receive	1
two	1
thousand	1
blows	1
of	1
the	1
stick,	1
a	1
number	1
which	1
most	1
likely	1
would	1
have	1
deprived	1
the	1
world	1
of	1
“Don	1
Quixote,”	1
had	1
not	1
some	1
persons,	1
who	1
they	1
were	1
we	1
know	1
not,	1
interceded	1
on	1
his	1
behalf.	1
After	1
this	1
he	1
seems	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
kept	1
in	1
still	1
closer	1
confinement	1
than	1
before,	1
for	1
nearly	1
two	1
years	1
passed	1
before	1
he	1
made	1
another	1
attempt.	1
This	1
time	1
his	1
plan	1
was	1
to	1
purchase,	1
by	1
the	1
aid	1
of	1
a	1
Spanish	1
renegade	1
and	1
two	1
Valencian	1
merchants	1
resident	1
in	1
Algiers,	1
an	1
armed	1
vessel	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
and	1
about	1
sixty	1
of	1
the	1
leading	1
captives	1
were	1
to	1
make	1
their	1
escape;	1
but	1
just	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
about	1
to	1
put	1
it	1
into	1
execution	1
one	1
Doctor	1
Juan	1
Blanco	1
de	1
Paz,	1
an	1
ecclesiastic	1
and	1
a	1
compatriot,	1
informed	1
the	1
Dey	1
of	1
the	1
plot.	1
Cervantes	1
by	1
force	1
of	1
character,	1
by	1
his	1
self-devotion,	1
by	1
his	1
untiring	1
energy	1
and	1
his	1
exertions	1
to	1
lighten	1
the	1
lot	1
of	1
his	1
companions	1
in	1
misery,	1
had	1
endeared	1
himself	1
to	1
all,	1
and	1
become	1
the	1
leading	1
spirit	1
in	1
the	1
captive	1
colony,	1
and,	1
incredible	1
as	1
it	1
may	1
seem,	1
jealousy	1
of	1
his	1
influence	1
and	1
the	1
esteem	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
held,	1
moved	1
this	1
man	1
to	1
compass	1
his	1
destruction	1
by	1
a	1
cruel	1
death.	1
The	1
merchants	1
finding	1
that	1
the	1
Dey	1
knew	1
all,	1
and	1
fearing	1
that	1
Cervantes	1
under	1
torture	1
might	1
make	1
disclosures	1
that	1
would	1
imperil	1
their	1
own	1
lives,	1
tried	1
to	1
persuade	1
him	1
to	1
slip	1
away	1
on	1
board	1
a	1
vessel	1
that	1
was	1
on	1
the	1
point	1
of	1
sailing	1
for	1
Spain;	1
but	1
he	1
told	1
them	1
they	1
had	1
nothing	1
to	1
fear,	1
for	1
no	1
tortures	1
would	1
make	1
him	1
compromise	1
anybody,	1
and	1
he	1
went	1
at	1
once	1
and	1
gave	1
himself	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
Dey.	1
As	1
before,	1
the	1
Dey	1
tried	1
to	1
force	1
him	1
to	1
name	1
his	1
accomplices.	1
Everything	1
was	1
made	1
ready	1
for	1
his	1
immediate	1
execution;	1
the	1
halter	1
was	1
put	1
round	1
his	1
neck	1
and	1
his	1
hands	1
tied	1
behind	1
him,	1
but	1
all	1
that	1
could	1
be	1
got	1
from	1
him	1
was	1
that	1
he	1
himself,	1
with	1
the	1
help	1
of	1
four	1
gentlemen	1
who	1
had	1
since	1
left	1
Algiers,	1
had	1
arranged	1
the	1
whole,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
sixty	1
who	1
were	1
to	1
accompany	1
him	1
were	1
not	1
to	1
know	1
anything	1
of	1
it	1
until	1
the	1
last	1
moment.	1
Finding	1
he	1
could	1
make	1
nothing	1
of	1
him,	1
the	1
Dey	1
sent	1
him	1
back	1
to	1
prison	1
more	1
heavily	1
ironed	1
than	1
before.	1
The	1
poverty-stricken	1
Cervantes	1
family	1
had	1
been	1
all	1
this	1
time	1
trying	1
once	1
more	1
to	1
raise	1
the	1
ransom	1
money,	1
and	1
at	1
last	1
a	1
sum	1
of	1
three	1
hundred	1
ducats	1
was	1
got	1
together	1
and	1
entrusted	1
to	1
the	1
Redemptorist	1
Father	1
Juan	1
Gil,	1
who	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
sail	1
for	1
Algiers.	1
The	1
Dey,	1
however,	1
demanded	1
more	1
than	1
double	1
the	1
sum	1
offered,	1
and	1
as	1
his	1
term	1
of	1
office	1
had	1
expired	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
sail	1
for	1
Constantinople,	1
taking	1
all	1
his	1
slaves	1
with	1
him,	1
the	1
case	1
of	1
Cervantes	1
was	1
critical.	1
He	1
was	1
already	1
on	1
board	1
heavily	1
ironed,	1
when	1
the	1
Dey	1
at	1
length	1
agreed	1
to	1
reduce	1
his	1
demand	1
by	1
one-half,	1
and	1
Father	1
Gil	1
by	1
borrowing	1
was	1
able	1
to	1
make	1
up	1
the	1
amount,	1
and	1
on	1
September	1
19,	1
1580,	1
after	1
a	1
captivity	1
of	1
five	1
years	1
all	1
but	1
a	1
week,	1
Cervantes	1
was	1
at	1
last	1
set	1
free.	1
Before	1
long	1
he	1
discovered	1
that	1
Blanco	1
de	1
Paz,	1
who	1
claimed	1
to	1
be	1
an	1
officer	1
of	1
the	1
Inquisition,	1
was	1
now	1
concocting	1
on	1
false	1
evidence	1
a	1
charge	1
of	1
misconduct	1
to	1
be	1
brought	1
against	1
him	1
on	1
his	1
return	1
to	1
Spain.	1
To	1
checkmate	1
him	1
Cervantes	1
drew	1
up	1
a	1
series	1
of	1
twenty-five	1
questions,	1
covering	1
the	1
whole	1
period	1
of	1
his	1
captivity,	1
upon	1
which	1
he	1
requested	1
Father	1
Gil	1
to	1
take	1
the	1
depositions	1
of	1
credible	1
witnesses	1
before	1
a	1
notary.	1
Eleven	1
witnesses	1
taken	1
from	1
among	1
the	1
principal	1
captives	1
in	1
Algiers	1
deposed	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
facts	1
above	1
stated	1
and	1
to	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
more	1
besides.	1
There	1
is	1
something	1
touching	1
in	1
the	1
admiration,	1
love,	1
and	1
gratitude	1
we	1
see	1
struggling	1
to	1
find	1
expression	1
in	1
the	1
formal	1
language	1
of	1
the	1
notary,	1
as	1
they	1
testify	1
one	1
after	1
another	1
to	1
the	1
good	1
deeds	1
of	1
Cervantes,	1
how	1
he	1
comforted	1
and	1
helped	1
the	1
weak-hearted,	1
how	1
he	1
kept	1
up	1
their	1
drooping	1
courage,	1
how	1
he	1
shared	1
his	1
poor	1
purse	1
with	1
this	1
deponent,	1
and	1
how	1
“in	1
him	1
this	1
deponent	1
found	1
father	1
and	1
mother.”	1
On	1
his	1
return	1
to	1
Spain	1
he	1
found	1
his	1
old	1
regiment	1
about	1
to	1
march	1
for	1
Portugal	1
to	1
support	1
Philip’s	1
claim	1
to	1
the	1
crown,	1
and	1
utterly	1
penniless	1
now,	1
had	1
no	1
choice	1
but	1
to	1
rejoin	1
it.	1
He	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
expeditions	1
to	1
the	1
Azores	1
in	1
1582	1
and	1
the	1
following	1
year,	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
conclusion	1
of	1
the	1
war	1
returned	1
to	1
Spain	1
in	1
the	1
autumn	1
of	1
1583,	1
bringing	1
with	1
him	1
the	1
manuscript	1
of	1
his	1
pastoral	1
romance,	1
the	1
“Galatea,”	1
and	1
probably	1
also,	1
to	1
judge	1
by	1
internal	1
evidence,	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
portion	1
of	1
“Persiles	1
and	1
Sigismunda.”	1
He	1
also	1
brought	1
back	1
with	1
him,	1
his	1
biographers	1
assert,	1
an	1
infant	1
daughter,	1
the	1
offspring	1
of	1
an	1
amour,	1
as	1
some	1
of	1
them	1
with	1
great	1
circumstantiality	1
inform	1
us,	1
with	1
a	1
Lisbon	1
lady	1
of	1
noble	1
birth,	1
whose	1
name,	1
however,	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
street	1
she	1
lived	1
in,	1
they	1
omit	1
to	1
mention.	1
The	1
sole	1
foundation	1
for	1
all	1
this	1
is	1
that	1
in	1
1605	1
there	1
certainly	1
was	1
living	1
in	1
the	1
family	1
of	1
Cervantes	1
a	1
Doña	1
Isabel	1
de	1
Saavedra,	1
who	1
is	1
described	1
in	1
an	1
official	1
document	1
as	1
his	1
natural	1
daughter,	1
and	1
then	1
twenty	1
years	1
of	1
age.	1
With	1
his	1
crippled	1
left	1
hand	1
promotion	1
in	1
the	1
army	1
was	1
hopeless,	1
now	1
that	1
Don	1
John	1
was	1
dead	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
no	1
one	1
to	1
press	1
his	1
claims	1
and	1
services,	1
and	1
for	1
a	1
man	1
drawing	1
on	1
to	1
forty	1
life	1
in	1
the	1
ranks	1
was	1
a	1
dismal	1
prospect;	1
he	1
had	1
already	1
a	1
certain	1
reputation	1
as	1
a	1
poet;	1
he	1
made	1
up	1
his	1
mind,	1
therefore,	1
to	1
cast	1
his	1
lot	1
with	1
literature,	1
and	1
for	1
a	1
first	1
venture	1
committed	1
his	1
“Galatea”	1
to	1
the	1
press.	1
It	1
was	1
published,	1
as	1
Salva	1
y	1
Mallen	1
shows	1
conclusively,	1
at	1
Alcalá,	1
his	1
own	1
birth-place,	1
in	1
1585	1
and	1
no	1
doubt	1
helped	1
to	1
make	1
his	1
name	1
more	1
widely	1
known,	1
but	1
certainly	1
did	1
not	1
do	1
him	1
much	1
good	1
in	1
any	1
other	1
way.	1
While	1
it	1
was	1
going	1
through	1
the	1
press,	1
he	1
married	1
Doña	1
Catalina	1
de	1
Palacios	1
Salazar	1
y	1
Vozmediano,	1
a	1
lady	1
of	1
Esquivias	1
near	1
Madrid,	1
and	1
apparently	1
a	1
friend	1
of	1
the	1
family,	1
who	1
brought	1
him	1
a	1
fortune	1
which	1
may	1
possibly	1
have	1
served	1
to	1
keep	1
the	1
wolf	1
from	1
the	1
door,	1
but	1
if	1
so,	1
that	1
was	1
all.	1
The	1
drama	1
had	1
by	1
this	1
time	1
outgrown	1
market-place	1
stages	1
and	1
strolling	1
companies,	1
and	1
with	1
his	1
old	1
love	1
for	1
it	1
he	1
naturally	1
turned	1
to	1
it	1
for	1
a	1
congenial	1
employment.	1
In	1
about	1
three	1
years	1
he	1
wrote	1
twenty	1
or	1
thirty	1
plays,	1
which	1
he	1
tells	1
us	1
were	1
performed	1
without	1
any	1
throwing	1
of	1
cucumbers	1
or	1
other	1
missiles,	1
and	1
ran	1
their	1
course	1
without	1
any	1
hisses,	1
outcries,	1
or	1
disturbance.	1
In	1
other	1
words,	1
his	1
plays	1
were	1
not	1
bad	1
enough	1
to	1
be	1
hissed	1
off	1
the	1
stage,	1
but	1
not	1
good	1
enough	1
to	1
hold	1
their	1
own	1
upon	1
it.	1
Only	1
two	1
of	1
them	1
have	1
been	1
preserved,	1
but	1
as	1
they	1
happen	1
to	1
be	1
two	1
of	1
the	1
seven	1
or	1
eight	1
he	1
mentions	1
with	1
complacency,	1
we	1
may	1
assume	1
they	1
are	1
favourable	1
specimens,	1
and	1
no	1
one	1
who	1
reads	1
the	1
“Numancia”	1
and	1
the	1
“Trato	1
de	1
Argel”	1
will	1
feel	1
any	1
surprise	1
that	1
they	1
failed	1
as	1
acting	1
dramas.	1
Whatever	1
merits	1
they	1
may	1
have,	1
whatever	1
occasional	1
they	1
may	1
show,	1
they	1
are,	1
as	1
regards	1
construction,	1
incurably	1
clumsy.	1
How	1
completely	1
they	1
failed	1
is	1
manifest	1
from	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
with	1
all	1
his	1
sanguine	1
temperament	1
and	1
indomitable	1
perseverance	1
he	1
was	1
unable	1
to	1
maintain	1
the	1
struggle	1
to	1
gain	1
a	1
livelihood	1
as	1
a	1
dramatist	1
for	1
more	1
than	1
three	1
years;	1
nor	1
was	1
the	1
rising	1
popularity	1
of	1
Lope	1
the	1
cause,	1
as	1
is	1
often	1
said,	1
notwithstanding	1
his	1
own	1
words	1
to	1
the	1
contrary.	1
When	1
Lope	1
began	1
to	1
write	1
for	1
the	1
stage	1
is	1
uncertain,	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
certainly	1
after	1
Cervantes	1
went	1
to	1
Seville.	1
Among	1
the	1
“Nuevos	1
Documentos”	1
printed	1
by	1
Señor	1
Asensio	1
y	1
Toledo	1
is	1
one	1
dated	1
1592,	1
and	1
curiously	1
characteristic	1
of	1
Cervantes.	1
It	1
is	1
an	1
agreement	1
with	1
one	1
Rodrigo	1
Osorio,	1
a	1
manager,	1
who	1
was	1
to	1
accept	1
six	1
comedies	1
at	1
fifty	1
ducats	1
(about	1
6l.)	1
apiece,	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
paid	1
in	1
any	1
case	1
unless	1
it	1
appeared	1
on	1
representation	1
that	1
the	1
said	1
comedy	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
best	1
that	1
had	1
ever	1
been	1
represented	1
in	1
Spain.	1
The	1
test	1
does	1
not	1
seem	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
ever	1
applied;	1
perhaps	1
it	1
was	1
sufficiently	1
apparent	1
to	1
Rodrigo	1
Osorio	1
that	1
the	1
comedies	1
were	1
not	1
among	1
the	1
best	1
that	1
had	1
ever	1
been	1
represented.	1
Among	1
the	1
correspondence	1
of	1
Cervantes	1
there	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
found,	1
no	1
doubt,	1
more	1
than	1
one	1
letter	1
like	1
that	1
we	1
see	1
in	1
the	1
“Rake’s	1
Progress,”	1
“Sir,	1
I	1
have	1
read	1
your	1
play,	1
and	1
it	1
will	1
not	1
doo.”	1
He	1
was	1
more	1
successful	1
in	1
a	1
literary	1
contest	1
at	1
Saragossa	1
in	1
1595	1
in	1
honour	1
of	1
the	1
canonisation	1
of	1
St.	1
Jacinto,	1
when	1
his	1
composition	1
won	1
the	1
first	1
prize,	1
three	1
silver	1
spoons.	1
The	1
year	1
before	1
this	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
appointed	1
a	1
collector	1
of	1
revenues	1
for	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
Granada.	1
In	1
order	1
to	1
remit	1
the	1
money	1
he	1
had	1
collected	1
more	1
conveniently	1
to	1
the	1
treasury,	1
he	1
entrusted	1
it	1
to	1
a	1
merchant,	1
who	1
failed	1
and	1
absconded;	1
and	1
as	1
the	1
bankrupt’s	1
assets	1
were	1
insufficient	1
to	1
cover	1
the	1
whole,	1
he	1
was	1
sent	1
to	1
prison	1
at	1
Seville	1
in	1
September	1
1597.	1
The	1
balance	1
against	1
him,	1
however,	1
was	1
a	1
small	1
one,	1
about	1
26l.,	1
and	1
on	1
giving	1
security	1
for	1
it	1
he	1
was	1
released	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
year.	1
It	1
was	1
as	1
he	1
journeyed	1
from	1
town	1
to	1
town	1
collecting	1
the	1
king’s	1
taxes,	1
that	1
he	1
noted	1
down	1
those	1
bits	1
of	1
inn	1
and	1
wayside	1
life	1
and	1
character	1
that	1
abound	1
in	1
the	1
pages	1
of	1
“Don	1
Quixote:”	1
the	1
Benedictine	1
monks	1
with	1
spectacles	1
and	1
sunshades,	1
mounted	1
on	1
their	1
tall	1
mules;	1
the	1
strollers	1
in	1
costume	1
bound	1
for	1
the	1
next	1
village;	1
the	1
barber	1
with	1
his	1
basin	1
on	1
his	1
head,	1
on	1
his	1
way	1
to	1
bleed	1
a	1
patient;	1
the	1
recruit	1
with	1
his	1
breeches	1
in	1
his	1
bundle,	1
tramping	1
along	1
the	1
road	1
singing;	1
the	1
reapers	1
gathered	1
in	1
the	1
venta	1
gateway	1
listening	1
to	1
“Felixmarte	1
of	1
Hircania”	1
read	1
out	1
to	1
them;	1
and	1
those	1
little	1
Hogarthian	1
touches	1
that	1
he	1
so	1
well	1
knew	1
how	1
to	1
bring	1
in,	1
the	1
ox-tail	1
hanging	1
up	1
with	1
the	1
landlord’s	1
comb	1
stuck	1
in	1
it,	1
the	1
wine-skins	1
at	1
the	1
bed-head,	1
and	1
those	1
notable	1
examples	1
of	1
hostelry	1
art,	1
Helen	1
going	1
off	1
in	1
high	1
spirits	1
on	1
Paris’s	1
arm,	1
and	1
Dido	1
on	1
the	1
tower	1
dropping	1
tears	1
as	1
big	1
as	1
walnuts.	1
Nay,	1
it	1
may	1
well	1
be	1
that	1
on	1
those	1
journeys	1
into	1
remote	1
regions	1
he	1
came	1
across	1
now	1
and	1
then	1
a	1
specimen	1
of	1
the	1
pauper	1
gentleman,	1
with	1
his	1
lean	1
hack	1
and	1
his	1
greyhound	1
and	1
his	1
books	1
of	1
chivalry,	1
dreaming	1
away	1
his	1
life	1
in	1
happy	1
ignorance	1
that	1
the	1
world	1
had	1
changed	1
since	1
his	1
great-grandfather’s	1
old	1
helmet	1
was	1
new.	1
But	1
it	1
was	1
in	1
Seville	1
that	1
he	1
found	1
out	1
his	1
true	1
vocation,	1
though	1
he	1
himself	1
would	1
not	1
by	1
any	1
means	1
have	1
admitted	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
so.	1
It	1
was	1
there,	1
in	1
Triana,	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
first	1
tempted	1
to	1
try	1
his	1
hand	1
at	1
drawing	1
from	1
life,	1
and	1
first	1
brought	1
his	1
humour	1
into	1
play	1
in	1
the	1
exquisite	1
little	1
sketch	1
of	1
“Rinconete	1
y	1
Cortadillo,”	1
the	1
germ,	1
in	1
more	1
ways	1
than	1
one,	1
of	1
“Don	1
Quixote.”	1
Where	1
and	1
when	1
that	1
was	1
written,	1
we	1
cannot	1
tell.	1
After	1
his	1
imprisonment	1
all	1
trace	1
of	1
Cervantes	1
in	1
his	1
official	1
capacity	1
disappears,	1
from	1
which	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
inferred	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
reinstated.	1
That	1
he	1
was	1
still	1
in	1
Seville	1
in	1
November	1
1598	1
appears	1
from	1
a	1
satirical	1
sonnet	1
of	1
his	1
on	1
the	1
elaborate	1
catafalque	1
erected	1
to	1
testify	1
the	1
grief	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
at	1
the	1
death	1
of	1
Philip	1
II,	1
but	1
from	1
this	1
up	1
to	1
1603	1
we	1
have	1
no	1
clue	1
to	1
his	1
movements.	1
The	1
words	1
in	1
the	1
preface	1
to	1
the	1
First	1
Part	1
of	1
“Don	1
Quixote”	1
are	1
generally	1
held	1
to	1
be	1
conclusive	1
that	1
he	1
conceived	1
the	1
idea	1
of	1
the	1
book,	1
and	1
wrote	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
it	1
at	1
least,	1
in	1
a	1
prison,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
have	1
done	1
so	1
is	1
extremely	1
likely.	1
There	1
is	1
a	1
tradition	1
that	1
Cervantes	1
read	1
some	1
portions	1
of	1
his	1
work	1
to	1
a	1
select	1
audience	1
at	1
the	1
Duke	1
of	1
Bejar’s,	1
which	1
may	1
have	1
helped	1
to	1
make	1
the	1
book	1
known;	1
but	1
the	1
obvious	1
conclusion	1
is	1
that	1
the	1
First	1
Part	1
of	1
“Don	1
Quixote”	1
lay	1
on	1
his	1
hands	1
some	1
time	1
before	1
he	1
could	1
find	1
a	1
publisher	1
bold	1
enough	1
to	1
undertake	1
a	1
venture	1
of	1
so	1
novel	1
a	1
character;	1
and	1
so	1
little	1
faith	1
in	1
it	1
had	1
Francisco	1
Robles	1
of	1
Madrid,	1
to	1
whom	1
at	1
last	1
he	1
sold	1
it,	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
care	1
to	1
incur	1
the	1
expense	1
of	1
securing	1
the	1
copyright	1
for	1
Aragon	1
or	1
Portugal,	1
contenting	1
himself	1
with	1
that	1
for	1
Castile.	1
The	1
printing	1
was	1
finished	1
in	1
December,	1
and	1
the	1
book	1
came	1
out	1
with	1
the	1
new	1
year,	1
1605.	1
It	1
is	1
often	1
said	1
that	1
“Don	1
Quixote”	1
was	1
at	1
first	1
received	1
coldly.	1
The	1
facts	1
show	1
just	1
the	1
contrary.	1
No	1
sooner	1
was	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
the	1
public	1
than	1
preparations	1
were	1
made	1
to	1
issue	1
pirated	1
editions	1
at	1
Lisbon	1
and	1
Valencia,	1
and	1
to	1
bring	1
out	1
a	1
second	1
edition	1
with	1
the	1
additional	1
copyrights	1
for	1
Aragon	1
and	1
Portugal,	1
which	1
he	1
secured	1
in	1
February.	1
No	1
doubt	1
it	1
was	1
received	1
with	1
something	1
more	1
than	1
coldness	1
by	1
certain	1
sections	1
of	1
the	1
community.	1
Men	1
of	1
wit,	1
taste,	1
and	1
discrimination	1
among	1
the	1
aristocracy	1
gave	1
it	1
a	1
hearty	1
welcome,	1
but	1
the	1
aristocracy	1
in	1
general	1
were	1
not	1
likely	1
to	1
relish	1
a	1
book	1
that	1
turned	1
their	1
favourite	1
reading	1
into	1
ridicule	1
and	1
laughed	1
at	1
so	1
many	1
of	1
their	1
favourite	1
ideas.	1
The	1
dramatists	1
who	1
gathered	1
round	1
Lope	1
as	1
their	1
leader	1
regarded	1
Cervantes	1
as	1
their	1
common	1
enemy,	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
plain	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
equally	1
obnoxious	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
clique,	1
the	1
culto	1
poets	1
who	1
had	1
Gongora	1
for	1
their	1
chief.	1
Navarrete,	1
who	1
knew	1
nothing	1
of	1
the	1
letter	1
above	1
mentioned,	1
tries	1
hard	1
to	1
show	1
that	1
the	1
relations	1
between	1
Cervantes	1
and	1
Lope	1
were	1
of	1
a	1
very	1
friendly	1
sort,	1
as	1
indeed	1
they	1
were	1
until	1
“Don	1
Quixote”	1
was	1
written.	1
Cervantes,	1
indeed,	1
to	1
the	1
last	1
generously	1
and	1
manfully	1
declared	1
his	1
admiration	1
of	1
Lope’s	1
powers,	1
his	1
unfailing	1
invention,	1
and	1
his	1
marvellous	1
fertility;	1
but	1
in	1
the	1
preface	1
of	1
the	1
First	1
Part	1
of	1
“Don	1
Quixote”	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
verses	1
of	1
“Urganda	1
the	1
Unknown,”	1
and	1
one	1
or	1
two	1
other	1
places,	1
there	1
are,	1
if	1
we	1
read	1
between	1
the	1
lines,	1
sly	1
hits	1
at	1
Lope’s	1
vanities	1
and	1
affectations	1
that	1
argue	1
no	1
personal	1
good-will;	1
and	1
Lope	1
openly	1
sneers	1
at	1
“Don	1
Quixote”	1
and	1
Cervantes,	1
and	1
fourteen	1
years	1
after	1
his	1
death	1
gives	1
him	1
only	1
a	1
few	1
lines	1
of	1
cold	1
commonplace	1
in	1
the	1
“Laurel	1
de	1
Apolo,”	1
that	1
seem	1
all	1
the	1
colder	1
for	1
the	1
eulogies	1
of	1
a	1
host	1
of	1
nonentities	1
whose	1
names	1
are	1
found	1
nowhere	1
else.	1
In	1
1601	1
Valladolid	1
was	1
made	1
the	1
seat	1
of	1
the	1
Court,	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
1603	1
Cervantes	1
had	1
been	1
summoned	1
thither	1
in	1
connection	1
with	1
the	1
balance	1
due	1
by	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
Treasury,	1
which	1
was	1
still	1
outstanding.	1
He	1
remained	1
at	1
Valladolid,	1
apparently	1
supporting	1
himself	1
by	1
agencies	1
and	1
scrivener’s	1
work	1
of	1
some	1
sort;	1
probably	1
drafting	1
petitions	1
and	1
drawing	1
up	1
statements	1
of	1
claims	1
to	1
be	1
presented	1
to	1
the	1
Council,	1
and	1
the	1
like.	1
So,	1
at	1
least,	1
we	1
gather	1
from	1
the	1
depositions	1
taken	1
on	1
the	1
occasion	1
of	1
the	1
death	1
of	1
a	1
gentleman,	1
the	1
victim	1
of	1
a	1
street	1
brawl,	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
carried	1
into	1
the	1
house	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
lived.	1
In	1
these	1
he	1
himself	1
is	1
described	1
as	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
wrote	1
and	1
transacted	1
business,	1
and	1
it	1
appears	1
that	1
his	1
household	1
then	1
consisted	1
of	1
his	1
wife,	1
the	1
natural	1
daughter	1
Isabel	1
de	1
Saavedra	1
already	1
mentioned,	1
his	1
sister	1
Andrea,	1
now	1
a	1
widow,	1
her	1
daughter	1
Constanza,	1
a	1
mysterious	1
Magdalena	1
de	1
Sotomayor	1
calling	1
herself	1
his	1
sister,	1
for	1
whom	1
his	1
biographers	1
cannot	1
account,	1
and	1
a	1
servant-maid.	1
Meanwhile	1
“Don	1
Quixote”	1
had	1
been	1
growing	1
in	1
favour,	1
and	1
its	1
author’s	1
name	1
was	1
now	1
known	1
beyond	1
the	1
Pyrenees.	1
In	1
1607	1
an	1
edition	1
was	1
printed	1
at	1
Brussels.	1
Robles,	1
the	1
Madrid	1
publisher,	1
found	1
it	1
necessary	1
to	1
meet	1
the	1
demand	1
by	1
a	1
third	1
edition,	1
the	1
seventh	1
in	1
all,	1
in	1
1608.	1
The	1
popularity	1
of	1
the	1
book	1
in	1
Italy	1
was	1
such	1
that	1
a	1
Milan	1
bookseller	1
was	1
led	1
to	1
bring	1
out	1
an	1
edition	1
in	1
1610;	1
and	1
another	1
was	1
called	1
for	1
in	1
Brussels	1
in	1
1611.	1
It	1
might	1
naturally	1
have	1
been	1
expected	1
that,	1
with	1
such	1
proofs	1
before	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
hit	1
the	1
taste	1
of	1
the	1
public,	1
Cervantes	1
would	1
have	1
at	1
once	1
set	1
about	1
redeeming	1
his	1
rather	1
vague	1
promise	1
of	1
a	1
second	1
volume.	1
But,	1
to	1
all	1
appearance,	1
nothing	1
was	1
farther	1
from	1
his	1
thoughts.	1
He	1
had	1
still	1
by	1
him	1
one	1
or	1
two	1
short	1
tales	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
vintage	1
as	1
those	1
he	1
had	1
inserted	1
in	1
“Don	1
Quixote”	1
and	1
instead	1
of	1
continuing	1
the	1
adventures	1
of	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
he	1
set	1
to	1
work	1
to	1
write	1
more	1
of	1
these	1
“Novelas	1
Exemplares”	1
as	1
he	1
afterwards	1
called	1
them,	1
with	1
a	1
view	1
to	1
making	1
a	1
book	1
of	1
them.	1
The	1
novels	1
were	1
published	1
in	1
the	1
summer	1
of	1
1613,	1
with	1
a	1
dedication	1
to	1
the	1
Conde	1
de	1
Lemos,	1
the	1
Maecenas	1
of	1
the	1
day,	1
and	1
with	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
chatty	1
confidential	1
prefaces	1
Cervantes	1
was	1
so	1
fond	1
of.	1
In	1
this,	1
eight	1
years	1
and	1
a	1
half	1
after	1
the	1
First	1
Part	1
of	1
“Don	1
Quixote”	1
had	1
appeared,	1
we	1
get	1
the	1
first	1
hint	1
of	1
a	1
forthcoming	1
Second	1
Part.	1
“You	1
shall	1
see	1
shortly,”	1
he	1
says,	1
“the	1
further	1
exploits	1
of	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
and	1
humours	1
of	1
Sancho	1
Panza.”	1
His	1
idea	1
of	1
“shortly”	1
was	1
a	1
somewhat	1
elastic	1
one,	1
for,	1
as	1
we	1
know	1
by	1
the	1
date	1
to	1
Sancho’s	1
letter,	1
he	1
had	1
barely	1
one-half	1
of	1
the	1
book	1
completed	1
that	1
time	1
twelvemonth.	1
But	1
more	1
than	1
poems,	1
or	1
pastorals,	1
or	1
novels,	1
it	1
was	1
his	1
dramatic	1
ambition	1
that	1
engrossed	1
his	1
thoughts.	1
The	1
same	1
indomitable	1
spirit	1
that	1
kept	1
him	1
from	1
despair	1
in	1
the	1
bagnios	1
of	1
Algiers,	1
and	1
prompted	1
him	1
to	1
attempt	1
the	1
escape	1
of	1
himself	1
and	1
his	1
comrades	1
again	1
and	1
again,	1
made	1
him	1
persevere	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
failure	1
and	1
discouragement	1
in	1
his	1
efforts	1
to	1
win	1
the	1
ear	1
of	1
the	1
public	1
as	1
a	1
dramatist.	1
The	1
temperament	1
of	1
Cervantes	1
was	1
essentially	1
sanguine.	1
The	1
portrait	1
he	1
draws	1
in	1
the	1
preface	1
to	1
the	1
novels,	1
with	1
the	1
aquiline	1
features,	1
chestnut	1
hair,	1
smooth	1
untroubled	1
forehead,	1
and	1
bright	1
cheerful	1
eyes,	1
is	1
the	1
very	1
portrait	1
of	1
a	1
sanguine	1
man.	1
Nothing	1
that	1
the	1
managers	1
might	1
say	1
could	1
persuade	1
him	1
that	1
the	1
merits	1
of	1
his	1
plays	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
recognised	1
at	1
last	1
if	1
they	1
were	1
only	1
given	1
a	1
fair	1
chance.	1
The	1
old	1
soldier	1
of	1
the	1
Spanish	1
Salamis	1
was	1
bent	1
on	1
being	1
the	1
Aeschylus	1
of	1
Spain.	1
He	1
was	1
to	1
found	1
a	1
great	1
national	1
drama,	1
based	1
on	1
the	1
true	1
principles	1
of	1
art,	1
that	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
envy	1
of	1
all	1
nations;	1
he	1
was	1
to	1
drive	1
from	1
the	1
stage	1
the	1
silly,	1
childish	1
plays,	1
the	1
“mirrors	1
of	1
nonsense	1
and	1
models	1
of	1
folly”	1
that	1
were	1
in	1
vogue	1
through	1
the	1
cupidity	1
of	1
the	1
managers	1
and	1
shortsightedness	1
of	1
the	1
authors;	1
he	1
was	1
to	1
correct	1
and	1
educate	1
the	1
public	1
taste	1
until	1
it	1
was	1
ripe	1
for	1
tragedies	1
on	1
the	1
model	1
of	1
the	1
Greek	1
drama—like	1
the	1
“Numancia”	1
for	1
instance—and	1
comedies	1
that	1
would	1
not	1
only	1
amuse	1
but	1
improve	1
and	1
instruct.	1
All	1
this	1
he	1
was	1
to	1
do,	1
could	1
he	1
once	1
get	1
a	1
hearing:	1
there	1
was	1
the	1
initial	1
difficulty.	1
He	1
shows	1
plainly	1
enough,	1
too,	1
that	1
“Don	1
Quixote”	1
and	1
the	1
demolition	1
of	1
the	1
chivalry	1
romances	1
was	1
not	1
the	1
work	1
that	1
lay	1
next	1
his	1
heart.	1
He	1
was,	1
indeed,	1
as	1
he	1
says	1
himself	1
in	1
his	1
preface,	1
more	1
a	1
stepfather	1
than	1
a	1
father	1
to	1
“Don	1
Quixote.”	1
Never	1
was	1
great	1
work	1
so	1
neglected	1
by	1
its	1
author.	1
That	1
it	1
was	1
written	1
carelessly,	1
hastily,	1
and	1
by	1
fits	1
and	1
starts,	1
was	1
not	1
always	1
his	1
fault,	1
but	1
it	1
seems	1
clear	1
he	1
never	1
read	1
what	1
he	1
sent	1
to	1
the	1
press.	1
He	1
knew	1
how	1
the	1
printers	1
had	1
blundered,	1
but	1
he	1
never	1
took	1
the	1
trouble	1
to	1
correct	1
them	1
when	1
the	1
third	1
edition	1
was	1
in	1
progress,	1
as	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
really	1
cared	1
for	1
the	1
child	1
of	1
his	1
brain	1
would	1
have	1
done.	1
He	1
appears	1
to	1
have	1
regarded	1
the	1
book	1
as	1
little	1
more	1
than	1
a	1
mere	1
libro	1
de	1
entretenimiento,	1
an	1
amusing	1
book,	1
a	1
thing,	1
as	1
he	1
says	1
in	1
the	1
“Viaje,”	1
“to	1
divert	1
the	1
melancholy	1
moody	1
heart	1
at	1
any	1
time	1
or	1
season.”	1
No	1
doubt	1
he	1
had	1
an	1
affection	1
for	1
his	1
hero,	1
and	1
was	1
very	1
proud	1
of	1
Sancho	1
Panza.	1
It	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
strange	1
indeed	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
proud	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
humorous	1
creation	1
in	1
all	1
fiction.	1
He	1
was	1
proud,	1
too,	1
of	1
the	1
popularity	1
and	1
success	1
of	1
the	1
book,	1
and	1
beyond	1
measure	1
delightful	1
is	1
the	1
naivete	1
with	1
which	1
he	1
shows	1
his	1
pride	1
in	1
a	1
dozen	1
passages	1
in	1
the	1
Second	1
Part.	1
But	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
the	1
success	1
he	1
coveted.	1
In	1
all	1
probability	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
given	1
all	1
the	1
success	1
of	1
“Don	1
Quixote,”	1
nay,	1
would	1
have	1
seen	1
every	1
copy	1
of	1
“Don	1
Quixote”	1
burned	1
in	1
the	1
Plaza	1
Mayor,	1
for	1
one	1
such	1
success	1
as	1
Lope	1
de	1
Vega	1
was	1
enjoying	1
on	1
an	1
average	1
once	1
a	1
week.	1
And	1
so	1
he	1
went	1
on,	1
dawdling	1
over	1
“Don	1
Quixote,”	1
adding	1
a	1
chapter	1
now	1
and	1
again,	1
and	1
putting	1
it	1
aside	1
to	1
turn	1
to	1
“Persiles	1
and	1
Sigismunda”—which,	1
as	1
we	1
know,	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
most	1
entertaining	1
book	1
in	1
the	1
language,	1
and	1
the	1
rival	1
of	1
“Theagenes	1
and	1
Chariclea”—or	1
finishing	1
off	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
darling	1
comedies;	1
and	1
if	1
Robles	1
asked	1
when	1
“Don	1
Quixote”	1
would	1
be	1
ready,	1
the	1
answer	1
no	1
doubt	1
was:	1
En	1
breve—shortly,	1
there	1
was	1
time	1
enough	1
for	1
that.	1
At	1
sixty-eight	1
he	1
was	1
as	1
full	1
of	1
life	1
and	1
hope	1
and	1
plans	1
for	1
the	1
future	1
as	1
a	1
boy	1
of	1
eighteen.	1
Nemesis	1
was	1
coming,	1
however.	1
He	1
had	1
got	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
Chapter	1
LIX,	1
which	1
at	1
his	1
leisurely	1
pace	1
he	1
could	1
hardly	1
have	1
reached	1
before	1
October	1
or	1
November	1
1614,	1
when	1
there	1
was	1
put	1
into	1
his	1
hand	1
a	1
small	1
octave	1
lately	1
printed	1
at	1
Tarragona,	1
and	1
calling	1
itself	1
“Second	1
Volume	1
of	1
the	1
Ingenious	1
Gentleman	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
of	1
La	1
Mancha:	1
by	1
the	1
Licentiate	1
Alonso	1
Fernandez	1
de	1
Avellaneda	1
of	1
Tordesillas.”	1
The	1
last	1
half	1
of	1
Chapter	1
LIX	1
and	1
most	1
of	1
the	1
following	1
chapters	1
of	1
the	1
Second	1
Part	1
give	1
us	1
some	1
idea	1
of	1
the	1
effect	1
produced	1
upon	1
him,	1
and	1
his	1
irritation	1
was	1
not	1
likely	1
to	1
be	1
lessened	1
by	1
the	1
reflection	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
no	1
one	1
to	1
blame	1
but	1
himself.	1
Had	1
Avellaneda,	1
in	1
fact,	1
been	1
content	1
with	1
merely	1
bringing	1
out	1
a	1
continuation	1
to	1
“Don	1
Quixote,”	1
Cervantes	1
would	1
have	1
had	1
no	1
reasonable	1
grievance.	1
His	1
own	1
intentions	1
were	1
expressed	1
in	1
the	1
very	1
vaguest	1
language	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
book;	1
nay,	1
in	1
his	1
last	1
words,	1
“forse	1
altro	1
cantera	1
con	1
miglior	1
plettro,”	1
he	1
seems	1
actually	1
to	1
invite	1
someone	1
else	1
to	1
continue	1
the	1
work,	1
and	1
he	1
made	1
no	1
sign	1
until	1
eight	1
years	1
and	1
a	1
half	1
had	1
gone	1
by;	1
by	1
which	1
time	1
Avellaneda’s	1
volume	1
was	1
no	1
doubt	1
written.	1
In	1
fact	1
Cervantes	1
had	1
no	1
case,	1
or	1
a	1
very	1
bad	1
one,	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
the	1
mere	1
continuation	1
was	1
concerned.	1
But	1
Avellaneda	1
chose	1
to	1
write	1
a	1
preface	1
to	1
it,	1
full	1
of	1
such	1
coarse	1
personal	1
abuse	1
as	1
only	1
an	1
ill-conditioned	1
man	1
could	1
pour	1
out.	1
He	1
taunts	1
Cervantes	1
with	1
being	1
old,	1
with	1
having	1
lost	1
his	1
hand,	1
with	1
having	1
been	1
in	1
prison,	1
with	1
being	1
poor,	1
with	1
being	1
friendless,	1
accuses	1
him	1
of	1
envy	1
of	1
Lope’s	1
success,	1
of	1
petulance	1
and	1
querulousness,	1
and	1
so	1
on;	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
in	1
this	1
that	1
the	1
sting	1
lay.	1
Avellaneda’s	1
reason	1
for	1
this	1
personal	1
attack	1
is	1
obvious	1
enough.	1
Whoever	1
he	1
may	1
have	1
been,	1
it	1
is	1
clear	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
dramatists	1
of	1
Lope’s	1
school,	1
for	1
he	1
has	1
the	1
impudence	1
to	1
charge	1
Cervantes	1
with	1
attacking	1
him	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
Lope	1
in	1
his	1
criticism	1
on	1
the	1
drama.	1
His	1
identification	1
has	1
exercised	1
the	1
best	1
critics	1
and	1
baffled	1
all	1
the	1
ingenuity	1
and	1
research	1
that	1
has	1
been	1
brought	1
to	1
bear	1
on	1
it.	1
Navarrete	1
and	1
Ticknor	1
both	1
incline	1
to	1
the	1
belief	1
that	1
Cervantes	1
knew	1
who	1
he	1
was;	1
but	1
I	1
must	1
say	1
I	1
think	1
the	1
anger	1
he	1
shows	1
suggests	1
an	1
invisible	1
assailant;	1
it	1
is	1
like	1
the	1
irritation	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
stung	1
by	1
a	1
mosquito	1
in	1
the	1
dark.	1
Cervantes	1
from	1
certain	1
solecisms	1
of	1
language	1
pronounces	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
an	1
Aragonese,	1
and	1
Pellicer,	1
an	1
Aragonese	1
himself,	1
supports	1
this	1
view	1
and	1
believes	1
him,	1
moreover,	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
an	1
ecclesiastic,	1
a	1
Dominican	1
probably.	1
Any	1
merit	1
Avellaneda	1
has	1
is	1
reflected	1
from	1
Cervantes,	1
and	1
he	1
is	1
too	1
dull	1
to	1
reflect	1
much.	1
“Dull	1
and	1
dirty”	1
will	1
always	1
be,	1
I	1
imagine,	1
the	1
verdict	1
of	1
the	1
vast	1
majority	1
of	1
unprejudiced	1
readers.	1
He	1
is,	1
at	1
best,	1
a	1
poor	1
plagiarist;	1
all	1
he	1
can	1
do	1
is	1
to	1
follow	1
slavishly	1
the	1
lead	1
given	1
him	1
by	1
Cervantes;	1
his	1
only	1
humour	1
lies	1
in	1
making	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
take	1
inns	1
for	1
castles	1
and	1
fancy	1
himself	1
some	1
legendary	1
or	1
historical	1
personage,	1
and	1
Sancho	1
mistake	1
words,	1
invert	1
proverbs,	1
and	1
display	1
his	1
gluttony;	1
all	1
through	1
he	1
shows	1
a	1
proclivity	1
to	1
coarseness	1
and	1
dirt,	1
and	1
he	1
has	1
contrived	1
to	1
introduce	1
two	1
tales	1
filthier	1
than	1
anything	1
by	1
the	1
sixteenth	1
century	1
novellieri	1
and	1
without	1
their	1
sprightliness.	1
But	1
whatever	1
Avellaneda	1
and	1
his	1
book	1
may	1
be,	1
we	1
must	1
not	1
forget	1
the	1
debt	1
we	1
owe	1
them.	1
But	1
for	1
them,	1
there	1
can	1
be	1
no	1
doubt,	1
“Don	1
Quixote”	1
would	1
have	1
come	1
to	1
us	1
a	1
mere	1
torso	1
instead	1
of	1
a	1
complete	1
work.	1
Even	1
if	1
Cervantes	1
had	1
finished	1
the	1
volume	1
he	1
had	1
in	1
hand,	1
most	1
assuredly	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
left	1
off	1
with	1
a	1
promise	1
of	1
a	1
Third	1
Part,	1
giving	1
the	1
further	1
adventures	1
of	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
and	1
humours	1
of	1
Sancho	1
Panza	1
as	1
shepherds.	1
It	1
is	1
plain	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
at	1
one	1
time	1
an	1
intention	1
of	1
dealing	1
with	1
the	1
pastoral	1
romances	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
dealt	1
with	1
the	1
books	1
of	1
chivalry,	1
and	1
but	1
for	1
Avellaneda	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
tried	1
to	1
carry	1
it	1
out.	1
But	1
it	1
is	1
more	1
likely	1
that,	1
with	1
his	1
plans,	1
and	1
projects,	1
and	1
hopefulness,	1
the	1
volume	1
would	1
have	1
remained	1
unfinished	1
till	1
his	1
death,	1
and	1
that	1
we	1
should	1
have	1
never	1
made	1
the	1
acquaintance	1
of	1
the	1
Duke	1
and	1
Duchess,	1
or	1
gone	1
with	1
Sancho	1
to	1
Barataria.	1
From	1
the	1
moment	1
the	1
book	1
came	1
into	1
his	1
hands	1
he	1
seems	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
haunted	1
by	1
the	1
fear	1
that	1
there	1
might	1
be	1
more	1
Avellanedas	1
in	1
the	1
field,	1
and	1
putting	1
everything	1
else	1
aside,	1
he	1
set	1
himself	1
to	1
finish	1
off	1
his	1
task	1
and	1
protect	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
in	1
the	1
only	1
way	1
he	1
could,	1
by	1
killing	1
him.	1
The	1
conclusion	1
is	1
no	1
doubt	1
a	1
hasty	1
and	1
in	1
some	1
places	1
clumsy	1
piece	1
of	1
work	1
and	1
the	1
frequent	1
repetition	1
of	1
the	1
scolding	1
administered	1
to	1
Avellaneda	1
becomes	1
in	1
the	1
end	1
rather	1
wearisome;	1
but	1
it	1
is,	1
at	1
any	1
rate,	1
a	1
conclusion	1
and	1
for	1
that	1
we	1
must	1
thank	1
Avellaneda.	1
The	1
new	1
volume	1
was	1
ready	1
for	1
the	1
press	1
in	1
February,	1
but	1
was	1
not	1
printed	1
till	1
the	1
very	1
end	1
of	1
1615,	1
and	1
during	1
the	1
interval	1
Cervantes	1
put	1
together	1
the	1
comedies	1
and	1
interludes	1
he	1
had	1
written	1
within	1
the	1
last	1
few	1
years,	1
and,	1
as	1
he	1
adds	1
plaintively,	1
found	1
no	1
demand	1
for	1
among	1
the	1
managers,	1
and	1
published	1
them	1
with	1
a	1
preface,	1
worth	1
the	1
book	1
it	1
introduces	1
tenfold,	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
gives	1
an	1
account	1
of	1
the	1
early	1
Spanish	1
stage,	1
and	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
attempts	1
as	1
a	1
dramatist.	1
It	1
is	1
needless	1
to	1
say	1
they	1
were	1
put	1
forward	1
by	1
Cervantes	1
in	1
all	1
good	1
faith	1
and	1
full	1
confidence	1
in	1
their	1
merits.	1
The	1
reader,	1
however,	1
was	1
not	1
to	1
suppose	1
they	1
were	1
his	1
last	1
word	1
or	1
final	1
effort	1
in	1
the	1
drama,	1
for	1
he	1
had	1
in	1
hand	1
a	1
comedy	1
called	1
“Engano	1
a	1
los	1
ojos,”	1
about	1
which,	1
if	1
he	1
mistook	1
not,	1
there	1
would	1
be	1
no	1
question.	1
Of	1
this	1
dramatic	1
masterpiece	1
the	1
world	1
has	1
no	1
opportunity	1
of	1
judging;	1
his	1
health	1
had	1
been	1
failing	1
for	1
some	1
time,	1
and	1
he	1
died,	1
apparently	1
of	1
dropsy,	1
on	1
the	1
23rd	1
of	1
April,	1
1616,	1
the	1
day	1
on	1
which	1
England	1
lost	1
Shakespeare,	1
nominally	1
at	1
least,	1
for	1
the	1
English	1
calendar	1
had	1
not	1
yet	1
been	1
reformed.	1
He	1
died	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
lived,	1
accepting	1
his	1
lot	1
bravely	1
and	1
cheerfully.	1
Was	1
it	1
an	1
unhappy	1
life,	1
that	1
of	1
Cervantes?	1
His	1
biographers	1
all	1
tell	1
us	1
that	1
it	1
was;	1
but	1
I	1
must	1
say	1
I	1
doubt	1
it.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
hard	1
life,	1
a	1
life	1
of	1
poverty,	1
of	1
incessant	1
struggle,	1
of	1
toil	1
ill	1
paid,	1
of	1
disappointment,	1
but	1
Cervantes	1
carried	1
within	1
himself	1
the	1
antidote	1
to	1
all	1
these	1
evils.	1
His	1
was	1
not	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
light	1
natures	1
that	1
rise	1
above	1
adversity	1
merely	1
by	1
virtue	1
of	1
their	1
own	1
buoyancy;	1
it	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
fortitude	1
of	1
a	1
high	1
spirit	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
proof	1
against	1
it.	1
It	1
is	1
impossible	1
to	1
conceive	1
Cervantes	1
giving	1
way	1
to	1
despondency	1
or	1
prostrated	1
by	1
dejection.	1
As	1
for	1
poverty,	1
it	1
was	1
with	1
him	1
a	1
thing	1
to	1
be	1
laughed	1
over,	1
and	1
the	1
only	1
sigh	1
he	1
ever	1
allows	1
to	1
escape	1
him	1
is	1
when	1
he	1
says,	1
“Happy	1
he	1
to	1
whom	1
Heaven	1
has	1
given	1
a	1
piece	1
of	1
bread	1
for	1
which	1
he	1
is	1
not	1
bound	1
to	1
give	1
thanks	1
to	1
any	1
but	1
Heaven	1
itself.”	1
Add	1
to	1
all	1
this	1
his	1
vital	1
energy	1
and	1
mental	1
activity,	1
his	1
restless	1
invention	1
and	1
his	1
sanguine	1
temperament,	1
and	1
there	1
will	1
be	1
reason	1
enough	1
to	1
doubt	1
whether	1
his	1
could	1
have	1
been	1
a	1
very	1
unhappy	1
life.	1
He	1
who	1
could	1
take	1
Cervantes’	1
distresses	1
together	1
with	1
his	1
apparatus	1
for	1
enduring	1
them	1
would	1
not	1
make	1
so	1
bad	1
a	1
bargain,	1
perhaps,	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
happiness	1
in	1
life	1
is	1
concerned.	1
Of	1
his	1
burial-place	1
nothing	1
is	1
known	1
except	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
buried,	1
in	1
accordance	1
with	1
his	1
will,	1
in	1
the	1
neighbouring	1
convent	1
of	1
Trinitarian	1
nuns,	1
of	1
which	1
it	1
is	1
supposed	1
his	1
daughter,	1
Isabel	1
de	1
Saavedra,	1
was	1
an	1
inmate,	1
and	1
that	1
a	1
few	1
years	1
afterwards	1
the	1
nuns	1
removed	1
to	1
another	1
convent,	1
carrying	1
their	1
dead	1
with	1
them.	1
But	1
whether	1
the	1
remains	1
of	1
Cervantes	1
were	1
included	1
in	1
the	1
removal	1
or	1
not	1
no	1
one	1
knows,	1
and	1
the	1
clue	1
to	1
their	1
resting-place	1
is	1
now	1
lost	1
beyond	1
all	1
hope.	1
This	1
furnishes	1
perhaps	1
the	1
least	1
defensible	1
of	1
the	1
items	1
in	1
the	1
charge	1
of	1
neglect	1
brought	1
against	1
his	1
contemporaries.	1
In	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
others	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
good	1
deal	1
of	1
exaggeration.	1
To	1
listen	1
to	1
most	1
of	1
his	1
biographers	1
one	1
would	1
suppose	1
that	1
all	1
Spain	1
was	1
in	1
league	1
not	1
only	1
against	1
the	1
man	1
but	1
against	1
his	1
memory,	1
or	1
at	1
least	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
insensible	1
to	1
his	1
merits,	1
and	1
left	1
him	1
to	1
live	1
in	1
misery	1
and	1
die	1
of	1
want.	1
To	1
talk	1
of	1
his	1
hard	1
life	1
and	1
unworthy	1
employments	1
in	1
Andalusia	1
is	1
absurd.	1
What	1
had	1
he	1
done	1
to	1
distinguish	1
him	1
from	1
thousands	1
of	1
other	1
struggling	1
men	1
earning	1
a	1
precarious	1
livelihood?	1
True,	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
gallant	1
soldier,	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
wounded	1
and	1
had	1
undergone	1
captivity	1
and	1
suffering	1
in	1
his	1
country’s	1
cause,	1
but	1
there	1
were	1
hundreds	1
of	1
others	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
case.	1
He	1
had	1
written	1
a	1
mediocre	1
specimen	1
of	1
an	1
insipid	1
class	1
of	1
romance,	1
and	1
some	1
plays	1
which	1
manifestly	1
did	1
not	1
comply	1
with	1
the	1
primary	1
condition	1
of	1
pleasing:	1
were	1
the	1
playgoers	1
to	1
patronise	1
plays	1
that	1
did	1
not	1
amuse	1
them,	1
because	1
the	1
author	1
was	1
to	1
produce	1
“Don	1
Quixote”	1
twenty	1
years	1
afterwards?	1
The	1
scramble	1
for	1
copies	1
which,	1
as	1
we	1
have	1
seen,	1
followed	1
immediately	1
on	1
the	1
appearance	1
of	1
the	1
book,	1
does	1
not	1
look	1
like	1
general	1
insensibility	1
to	1
its	1
merits.	1
No	1
doubt	1
it	1
was	1
received	1
coldly	1
by	1
some,	1
but	1
if	1
a	1
man	1
writes	1
a	1
book	1
in	1
ridicule	1
of	1
periwigs	1
he	1
must	1
make	1
his	1
account	1
with	1
being	1
coldly	1
received	1
by	1
the	1
periwig	1
wearers	1
and	1
hated	1
by	1
the	1
whole	1
tribe	1
of	1
wigmakers.	1
If	1
Cervantes	1
had	1
the	1
chivalry-romance	1
readers,	1
the	1
sentimentalists,	1
the	1
dramatists,	1
and	1
the	1
poets	1
of	1
the	1
period	1
all	1
against	1
him,	1
it	1
was	1
because	1
“Don	1
Quixote”	1
was	1
what	1
it	1
was;	1
and	1
if	1
the	1
general	1
public	1
did	1
not	1
come	1
forward	1
to	1
make	1
him	1
comfortable	1
for	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
his	1
days,	1
it	1
is	1
no	1
more	1
to	1
be	1
charged	1
with	1
neglect	1
and	1
ingratitude	1
than	1
the	1
English-speaking	1
public	1
that	1
did	1
not	1
pay	1
off	1
Scott’s	1
liabilities.	1
It	1
did	1
the	1
best	1
it	1
could;	1
it	1
read	1
his	1
book	1
and	1
liked	1
it	1
and	1
bought	1
it,	1
and	1
encouraged	1
the	1
bookseller	1
to	1
pay	1
him	1
well	1
for	1
others.	1
It	1
has	1
been	1
also	1
made	1
a	1
reproach	1
to	1
Spain	1
that	1
she	1
has	1
erected	1
no	1
monument	1
to	1
the	1
man	1
she	1
is	1
proudest	1
of;	1
no	1
monument,	1
that	1
is	1
to	1
say,	1
of	1
him;	1
for	1
the	1
bronze	1
statue	1
in	1
the	1
little	1
garden	1
of	1
the	1
Plaza	1
de	1
las	1
Cortés,	1
a	1
fair	1
work	1
of	1
art	1
no	1
doubt,	1
and	1
unexceptionable	1
had	1
it	1
been	1
set	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
local	1
poet	1
in	1
the	1
market-place	1
of	1
some	1
provincial	1
town,	1
is	1
not	1
worthy	1
of	1
Cervantes	1
or	1
of	1
Madrid.	1
But	1
what	1
need	1
has	1
Cervantes	1
of	1
“such	1
weak	1
witness	1
of	1
his	1
name;”	1
or	1
what	1
could	1
a	1
monument	1
do	1
in	1
his	1
case	1
except	1
testify	1
to	1
the	1
self-glorification	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
had	1
put	1
it	1
up?	1

The	1
nearest	1
bookseller’s	1
shop	1
will	1
show	1
what	1
bathos	1
there	1
would	1
be	1
in	1
a	1
monument	1
to	1
the	1
author	1
of	1
“Don	1
Quixote.”	1
‘DON	1
QUIXOTE’	1
Nine	1
editions	1
of	1
the	1
First	1
Part	1
of	1
“Don	1
Quixote”	1
had	1
already	1
appeared	1
before	1
Cervantes	1
died,	1
thirty	1
thousand	1
copies	1
in	1
all,	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
own	1
estimate,	1
and	1
a	1
tenth	1
was	1
printed	1
at	1
Barcelona	1
the	1
year	1
after	1
his	1
death.	1
So	1
large	1
a	1
number	1
naturally	1
supplied	1
the	1
demand	1
for	1
some	1
time,	1
but	1
by	1
1634	1
it	1
appears	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
exhausted;	1
and	1
from	1
that	1
time	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
present	1
day	1
the	1
stream	1
of	1
editions	1
has	1
continued	1
to	1
flow	1
rapidly	1
and	1
regularly.	1
The	1
translations	1
show	1
still	1
more	1
clearly	1
in	1
what	1
request	1
the	1
book	1
has	1
been	1
from	1
the	1
very	1
outset.	1
In	1
seven	1
years	1
from	1
the	1
completion	1
of	1
the	1
work	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
translated	1
into	1
the	1
four	1
leading	1
languages	1
of	1
Europe.	1
Except	1
the	1
Bible,	1
in	1
fact,	1
no	1
book	1
has	1
been	1
so	1
widely	1
diffused	1
as	1
“Don	1
Quixote.”	1
The	1
“Imitatio	1
Christi”	1
may	1
have	1
been	1
translated	1
into	1
as	1
many	1
different	1
languages,	1
and	1
perhaps	1
“Robinson	1
Crusoe”	1
and	1
the	1
“Vicar	1
of	1
Wakefield”	1
into	1
nearly	1
as	1
many,	1
but	1
in	1
multiplicity	1
of	1
translations	1
and	1
editions	1
“Don	1
Quixote”	1
leaves	1
them	1
all	1
far	1
behind.	1
Still	1
more	1
remarkable	1
is	1
the	1
character	1
of	1
this	1
wide	1
diffusion.	1
“Don	1
Quixote”	1
has	1
been	1
thoroughly	1
naturalised	1
among	1
people	1
whose	1
ideas	1
about	1
knight-errantry,	1
if	1
they	1
had	1
any	1
at	1
all,	1
were	1
of	1
the	1
vaguest,	1
who	1
had	1
never	1
seen	1
or	1
heard	1
of	1
a	1
book	1
of	1
chivalry,	1
who	1
could	1
not	1
possibly	1
feel	1
the	1
humour	1
of	1
the	1
burlesque	1
or	1
sympathise	1
with	1
the	1
author’s	1
purpose.	1
Another	1
curious	1
fact	1
is	1
that	1
this,	1
the	1
most	1
cosmopolitan	1
book	1
in	1
the	1
world,	1
is	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
intensely	1
national.	1
“Manon	1
Lescaut”	1
is	1
not	1
more	1
thoroughly	1
French,	1
“Tom	1
Jones”	1
not	1
more	1
English,	1
“Rob	1
Roy”	1
not	1
more	1
Scotch,	1
than	1
“Don	1
Quixote”	1
is	1
Spanish,	1
in	1
character,	1
in	1
ideas,	1
in	1
sentiment,	1
in	1
local	1
colour,	1
in	1
everything.	1
What,	1
then,	1
is	1
the	1
secret	1
of	1
this	1
unparalleled	1
popularity,	1
increasing	1
year	1
by	1
year	1
for	1
well-nigh	1
three	1
centuries?	1
One	1
explanation,	1
no	1
doubt,	1
is	1
that	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
books	1
in	1
the	1
world,	1
“Don	1
Quixote”	1
is	1
the	1
most	1
catholic.	1
There	1
is	1
something	1
in	1
it	1
for	1
every	1
sort	1
of	1
reader,	1
young	1
or	1
old,	1
sage	1
or	1
simple,	1
high	1
or	1
low.	1
As	1
Cervantes	1
himself	1
says	1
with	1
a	1
touch	1
of	1
pride,	1
“It	1
is	1
thumbed	1
and	1
read	1
and	1
got	1
by	1
heart	1
by	1
people	1
of	1
all	1
sorts;	1
the	1
children	1
turn	1
its	1
leaves,	1
the	1
young	1
people	1
read	1
it,	1
the	1
grown	1
men	1
understand	1
it,	1
the	1
old	1
folk	1
praise	1
it.”	1
But	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
idle	1
to	1
deny	1
that	1
the	1
ingredient	1
which,	1
more	1
than	1
its	1
humour,	1
or	1
its	1
wisdom,	1
or	1
the	1
fertility	1
of	1
invention	1
or	1
knowledge	1
of	1
human	1
nature	1
it	1
displays,	1
has	1
insured	1
its	1
success	1
with	1
the	1
multitude,	1
is	1
the	1
vein	1
of	1
farce	1
that	1
runs	1
through	1
it.	1
It	1
was	1
the	1
attack	1
upon	1
the	1
sheep,	1
the	1
battle	1
with	1
the	1
wine-skins,	1
Mambrino’s	1
helmet,	1
the	1
balsam	1
of	1
Fierabras,	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
knocked	1
over	1
by	1
the	1
sails	1
of	1
the	1
windmill,	1
Sancho	1
tossed	1
in	1
the	1
blanket,	1
the	1
mishaps	1
and	1
misadventures	1
of	1
master	1
and	1
man,	1
that	1
were	1
originally	1
the	1
great	1
attraction,	1
and	1
perhaps	1
are	1
so	1
still	1
to	1
some	1
extent	1
with	1
the	1
majority	1
of	1
readers.	1
It	1
is	1
plain	1
that	1
“Don	1
Quixote”	1
was	1
generally	1
regarded	1
at	1
first,	1
and	1
indeed	1
in	1
Spain	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time,	1
as	1
little	1
more	1
than	1
a	1
queer	1
droll	1
book,	1
full	1
of	1
laughable	1
incidents	1
and	1
absurd	1
situations,	1
very	1
amusing,	1
but	1
not	1
entitled	1
to	1
much	1
consideration	1
or	1
care.	1
All	1
the	1
editions	1
printed	1
in	1
Spain	1
from	1
1637	1
to	1
1771,	1
when	1
the	1
famous	1
printer	1
Ibarra	1
took	1
it	1
up,	1
were	1
mere	1
trade	1
editions,	1
badly	1
and	1
carelessly	1
printed	1
on	1
vile	1
paper	1
and	1
got	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
style	1
of	1
chap-books	1
intended	1
only	1
for	1
popular	1
use,	1
with,	1
in	1
most	1
instances,	1
uncouth	1
illustrations	1
and	1
clap-trap	1
additions	1
by	1
the	1
publisher.	1
To	1
England	1
belongs	1
the	1
credit	1
of	1
having	1
been	1
the	1
first	1
country	1
to	1
recognise	1
the	1
right	1
of	1
“Don	1
Quixote”	1
to	1
better	1
treatment	1
than	1
this.	1
The	1
London	1
edition	1
of	1
1738,	1
commonly	1
called	1
Lord	1
Carteret’s	1
from	1
having	1
been	1
suggested	1
by	1
him,	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
mere	1
_édition	1
de	1
luxe_.	1
It	1
produced	1
“Don	1
Quixote”	1
in	1
becoming	1
form	1
as	1
regards	1
paper	1
and	1
type,	1
and	1
embellished	1
with	1
plates	1
which,	1
if	1
not	1
particularly	1
happy	1
as	1
illustrations,	1
were	1
at	1
least	1
well	1
intentioned	1
and	1
well	1
executed,	1
but	1
it	1
also	1
aimed	1
at	1
correctness	1
of	1
text,	1
a	1
matter	1
to	1
which	1
nobody	1
except	1
the	1
editors	1
of	1
the	1
Valencia	1
and	1
Brussels	1
editions	1
had	1
given	1
even	1
a	1
passing	1
thought;	1
and	1
for	1
a	1
first	1
attempt	1
it	1
was	1
fairly	1
successful,	1
for	1
though	1
some	1
of	1
its	1
emendations	1
are	1
inadmissible,	1
a	1
good	1
many	1
of	1
them	1
have	1
been	1
adopted	1
by	1
all	1
subsequent	1
editors.	1
The	1
zeal	1
of	1
publishers,	1
editors,	1
and	1
annotators	1
brought	1
about	1
a	1
remarkable	1
change	1
of	1
sentiment	1
with	1
regard	1
to	1
“Don	1
Quixote.”	1
A	1
vast	1
number	1
of	1
its	1
admirers	1
began	1
to	1
grow	1
ashamed	1
of	1
laughing	1
over	1
it.	1
It	1
became	1
almost	1
a	1
crime	1
to	1
treat	1
it	1
as	1
a	1
humorous	1
book.	1
The	1
humour	1
was	1
not	1
entirely	1
denied,	1
but,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
new	1
view,	1
it	1
was	1
rated	1
as	1
an	1
altogether	1
secondary	1
quality,	1
a	1
mere	1
accessory,	1
nothing	1
more	1
than	1
the	1
stalking-horse	1
under	1
the	1
presentation	1
of	1
which	1
Cervantes	1
shot	1
his	1
philosophy	1
or	1
his	1
satire,	1
or	1
whatever	1
it	1
was	1
he	1
meant	1
to	1
shoot;	1
for	1
on	1
this	1
point	1
opinions	1
varied.	1
All	1
were	1
agreed,	1
however,	1
that	1
the	1
object	1
he	1
aimed	1
at	1
was	1
not	1
the	1
books	1
of	1
chivalry.	1
He	1
said	1
emphatically	1
in	1
the	1
preface	1
to	1
the	1
First	1
Part	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
last	1
sentence	1
of	1
the	1
Second,	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
no	1
other	1
object	1
in	1
view	1
than	1
to	1
discredit	1
these	1
books,	1
and	1
this,	1
to	1
advanced	1
criticism,	1
made	1
it	1
clear	1
that	1
his	1
object	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
something	1
else.	1
One	1
theory	1
was	1
that	1
the	1
book	1
was	1
a	1
kind	1
of	1
allegory,	1
setting	1
forth	1
the	1
eternal	1
struggle	1
between	1
the	1
ideal	1
and	1
the	1
real,	1
between	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
poetry	1
and	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
prose;	1
and	1
perhaps	1
German	1
philosophy	1
never	1
evolved	1
a	1
more	1
ungainly	1
or	1
unlikely	1
camel	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
depths	1
of	1
its	1
inner	1
consciousness.	1
Something	1
of	1
the	1
antagonism,	1
no	1
doubt,	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
found	1
in	1
“Don	1
Quixote,”	1
because	1
it	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
found	1
everywhere	1
in	1
life,	1
and	1
Cervantes	1
drew	1
from	1
life.	1
It	1
is	1
difficult	1
to	1
imagine	1
a	1
community	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
never-ceasing	1
game	1
of	1
cross-purposes	1
between	1
Sancho	1
Panza	1
and	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
recognised	1
as	1
true	1
to	1
nature.	1
In	1
the	1
stone	1
age,	1
among	1
the	1
lake	1
dwellers,	1
among	1
the	1
cave	1
men,	1
there	1
were	1
Don	1
Quixotes	1
and	1
Sancho	1
Panzas;	1
there	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
the	1
troglodyte	1
who	1
never	1
could	1
see	1
the	1
facts	1
before	1
his	1
eyes,	1
and	1
the	1
troglodyte	1
who	1
could	1
see	1
nothing	1
else.	1
But	1
to	1
suppose	1
Cervantes	1
deliberately	1
setting	1
himself	1
to	1
expound	1
any	1
such	1
idea	1
in	1
two	1
stout	1
quarto	1
volumes	1
is	1
to	1
suppose	1
something	1
not	1
only	1
very	1
unlike	1
the	1
age	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
lived,	1
but	1
altogether	1
unlike	1
Cervantes	1
himself,	1
who	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
the	1
first	1
to	1
laugh	1
at	1
an	1
attempt	1
of	1
the	1
sort	1
made	1
by	1
anyone	1
else.	1
The	1
extraordinary	1
influence	1
of	1
the	1
romances	1
of	1
chivalry	1
in	1
his	1
day	1
is	1
quite	1
enough	1
to	1
account	1
for	1
the	1
genesis	1
of	1
the	1
book.	1
Some	1
idea	1
of	1
the	1
prodigious	1
development	1
of	1
this	1
branch	1
of	1
literature	1
in	1
the	1
sixteenth	1
century	1
may	1
be	1
obtained	1
from	1
the	1
scrutiny	1
of	1
Chapter	1
VII,	1
if	1
the	1
reader	1
bears	1
in	1
mind	1
that	1
only	1
a	1
portion	1
of	1
the	1
romances	1
belonging	1
to	1
by	1
far	1
the	1
largest	1
group	1
are	1
enumerated.	1
As	1
to	1
its	1
effect	1
upon	1
the	1
nation,	1
there	1
is	1
abundant	1
evidence.	1
From	1
the	1
time	1
when	1
the	1
Amadises	1
and	1
Palmerins	1
began	1
to	1
grow	1
popular	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
very	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
century,	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
steady	1
stream	1
of	1
invective,	1
from	1
men	1
whose	1
character	1
and	1
position	1
lend	1
weight	1
to	1
their	1
words,	1
against	1
the	1
romances	1
of	1
chivalry	1
and	1
the	1
infatuation	1
of	1
their	1
readers.	1
Ridicule	1
was	1
the	1
only	1
besom	1
to	1
sweep	1
away	1
that	1
dust.	1
That	1
this	1
was	1
the	1
task	1
Cervantes	1
set	1
himself,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
ample	1
provocation	1
to	1
urge	1
him	1
to	1
it,	1
will	1
be	1
sufficiently	1
clear	1
to	1
those	1
who	1
look	1
into	1
the	1
evidence;	1
as	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
also	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
chivalry	1
itself	1
that	1
he	1
attacked	1
and	1
swept	1
away.	1
Of	1
all	1
the	1
absurdities	1
that,	1
thanks	1
to	1
poetry,	1
will	1
be	1
repeated	1
to	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
time,	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
greater	1
one	1
than	1
saying	1
that	1
“Cervantes	1
smiled	1
Spain’s	1
chivalry	1
away.”	1
In	1
the	1
first	1
place	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
chivalry	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
smile	1
away.	1
Spain’s	1
chivalry	1
had	1
been	1
dead	1
for	1
more	1
than	1
a	1
century.	1
Its	1
work	1
was	1
done	1
when	1
Granada	1
fell,	1
and	1
as	1
chivalry	1
was	1
essentially	1
republican	1
in	1
its	1
nature,	1
it	1
could	1
not	1
live	1
under	1
the	1
rule	1
that	1
Ferdinand	1
substituted	1
for	1
the	1
free	1
institutions	1
of	1
mediaeval	1
Spain.	1
What	1
he	1
did	1
smile	1
away	1
was	1
not	1
chivalry	1
but	1
a	1
degrading	1
mockery	1
of	1
it.	1
The	1
true	1
nature	1
of	1
the	1
“right	1
arm”	1
and	1
the	1
“bright	1
array,”	1
before	1
which,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
poet,	1
“the	1
world	1
gave	1
ground,”	1
and	1
which	1
Cervantes’	1
single	1
laugh	1
demolished,	1
may	1
be	1
gathered	1
from	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
countrymen,	1
Don	1
Felix	1
Pacheco,	1
as	1
reported	1
by	1
Captain	1
George	1
Carleton,	1
in	1
his	1
“Military	1
Memoirs	1
from	1
1672	1
to	1
1713.”	1
“Before	1
the	1
appearance	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
of	1
that	1
labour	1
of	1
Cervantes,”	1
he	1
said,	1
“it	1
was	1
next	1
to	1
an	1
impossibility	1
for	1
a	1
man	1
to	1
walk	1
the	1
streets	1
with	1
any	1
delight	1
or	1
without	1
danger.	1
There	1
were	1
seen	1
so	1
many	1
cavaliers	1
prancing	1
and	1
curvetting	1
before	1
the	1
windows	1
of	1
their	1
mistresses,	1
that	1
a	1
stranger	1
would	1
have	1
imagined	1
the	1
whole	1
nation	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
nothing	1
less	1
than	1
a	1
race	1
of	1
knight-errants.	1
But	1
after	1
the	1
world	1
became	1
a	1
little	1
acquainted	1
with	1
that	1
notable	1
history,	1
the	1
man	1
that	1
was	1
seen	1
in	1
that	1
once	1
celebrated	1
drapery	1
was	1
pointed	1
at	1
as	1
a	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
and	1
found	1
himself	1
the	1
jest	1
of	1
high	1
and	1
low.	1
And	1
I	1
verily	1
believe	1
that	1
to	1
this,	1
and	1
this	1
only,	1
we	1
owe	1
that	1
dampness	1
and	1
poverty	1
of	1
spirit	1
which	1
has	1
run	1
through	1
all	1
our	1
councils	1
for	1
a	1
century	1
past,	1
so	1
little	1
agreeable	1
to	1
those	1
nobler	1
actions	1
of	1
our	1
famous	1
ancestors.”	1
To	1
call	1
“Don	1
Quixote”	1
a	1
sad	1
book,	1
preaching	1
a	1
pessimist	1
view	1
of	1
life,	1
argues	1
a	1
total	1
misconception	1
of	1
its	1
drift.	1
It	1
would	1
be	1
so	1
if	1
its	1
moral	1
were	1
that,	1
in	1
this	1
world,	1
true	1
enthusiasm	1
naturally	1
leads	1
to	1
ridicule	1
and	1
discomfiture.	1
But	1
it	1
preaches	1
nothing	1
of	1
the	1
sort;	1
its	1
moral,	1
so	1
far	1
as	1
it	1
can	1
be	1
said	1
to	1
have	1
one,	1
is	1
that	1
the	1
spurious	1
enthusiasm	1
that	1
is	1
born	1
of	1
vanity	1
and	1
self-conceit,	1
that	1
is	1
made	1
an	1
end	1
in	1
itself,	1
not	1
a	1
means	1
to	1
an	1
end,	1
that	1
acts	1
on	1
mere	1
impulse,	1
regardless	1
of	1
circumstances	1
and	1
consequences,	1
is	1
mischievous	1
to	1
its	1
owner,	1
and	1
a	1
very	1
considerable	1
nuisance	1
to	1
the	1
community	1
at	1
large.	1
To	1
those	1
who	1
cannot	1
distinguish	1
between	1
the	1
one	1
kind	1
and	1
the	1
other,	1
no	1
doubt	1
“Don	1
Quixote”	1
is	1
a	1
sad	1
book;	1
no	1
doubt	1
to	1
some	1
minds	1
it	1
is	1
very	1
sad	1
that	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
had	1
just	1
uttered	1
so	1
beautiful	1
a	1
sentiment	1
as	1
that	1
“it	1
is	1
a	1
hard	1
case	1
to	1
make	1
slaves	1
of	1
those	1
whom	1
God	1
and	1
Nature	1
made	1
free,”	1
should	1
be	1
ungratefully	1
pelted	1
by	1
the	1
scoundrels	1
his	1
crazy	1
philanthropy	1
had	1
let	1
loose	1
on	1
society;	1
but	1
to	1
others	1
of	1
a	1
more	1
judicial	1
cast	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
a	1
matter	1
of	1
regret	1
that	1
reckless	1
self-sufficient	1
enthusiasm	1
is	1
not	1
oftener	1
requited	1
in	1
some	1
such	1
way	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
mischief	1
it	1
does	1
in	1
the	1
world.	1
A	1
very	1
slight	1
examination	1
of	1
the	1
structure	1
of	1
“Don	1
Quixote”	1
will	1
suffice	1
to	1
show	1
that	1
Cervantes	1
had	1
no	1
deep	1
design	1
or	1
elaborate	1
plan	1
in	1
his	1
mind	1
when	1
he	1
began	1
the	1
book.	1
When	1
he	1
wrote	1
those	1
lines	1
in	1
which	1
“with	1
a	1
few	1
strokes	1
of	1
a	1
great	1
master	1
he	1
sets	1
before	1
us	1
the	1
pauper	1
gentleman,”	1
he	1
had	1
no	1
idea	1
of	1
the	1
goal	1
to	1
which	1
his	1
imagination	1
was	1
leading	1
him.	1
There	1
can	1
be	1
little	1
doubt	1
that	1
all	1
he	1
contemplated	1
was	1
a	1
short	1
tale	1
to	1
range	1
with	1
those	1
he	1
had	1
already	1
written,	1
a	1
tale	1
setting	1
forth	1
the	1
ludicrous	1
results	1
that	1
might	1
be	1
expected	1
to	1
follow	1
the	1
attempt	1
of	1
a	1
crazy	1
gentleman	1
to	1
act	1
the	1
part	1
of	1
a	1
knight-errant	1
in	1
modern	1
life.	1
It	1
is	1
plain,	1
for	1
one	1
thing,	1
that	1
Sancho	1
Panza	1
did	1
not	1
enter	1
into	1
the	1
original	1
scheme,	1
for	1
had	1
Cervantes	1
thought	1
of	1
him	1
he	1
certainly	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
omitted	1
him	1
in	1
his	1
hero’s	1
outfit,	1
which	1
he	1
obviously	1
meant	1
to	1
be	1
complete.	1
Him	1
we	1
owe	1
to	1
the	1
landlord’s	1
chance	1
remark	1
in	1
Chapter	1
III	1
that	1
knights	1
seldom	1
travelled	1
without	1
squires.	1
To	1
try	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
a	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
without	1
Sancho	1
Panza	1
is	1
like	1
trying	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
a	1
one-bladed	1
pair	1
of	1
scissors.	1
The	1
story	1
was	1
written	1
at	1
first,	1
like	1
the	1
others,	1
without	1
any	1
division	1
and	1
without	1
the	1
intervention	1
of	1
Cid	1
Hamete	1
Benengeli;	1
and	1
it	1
seems	1
not	1
unlikely	1
that	1
Cervantes	1
had	1
some	1
intention	1
of	1
bringing	1
Dulcinea,	1
or	1
Aldonza	1
Lorenzo,	1
on	1
the	1
scene	1
in	1
person.	1
It	1
was	1
probably	1
the	1
ransacking	1
of	1
the	1
Don’s	1
library	1
and	1
the	1
discussion	1
on	1
the	1
books	1
of	1
chivalry	1
that	1
first	1
suggested	1
it	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
his	1
idea	1
was	1
capable	1
of	1
development.	1
What,	1
if	1
instead	1
of	1
a	1
mere	1
string	1
of	1
farcical	1
misadventures,	1
he	1
were	1
to	1
make	1
his	1
tale	1
a	1
burlesque	1
of	1
one	1
of	1
these	1
books,	1
caricaturing	1
their	1
style,	1
incidents,	1
and	1
spirit?	1
In	1
pursuance	1
of	1
this	1
change	1
of	1
plan,	1
he	1
hastily	1
and	1
somewhat	1
clumsily	1
divided	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
written	1
into	1
chapters	1
on	1
the	1
model	1
of	1
“Amadis,”	1
invented	1
the	1
fable	1
of	1
a	1
mysterious	1
Arabic	1
manuscript,	1
and	1
set	1
up	1
Cid	1
Hamete	1
Benengeli	1
in	1
imitation	1
of	1
the	1
almost	1
invariable	1
practice	1
of	1
the	1
chivalry-romance	1
authors,	1
who	1
were	1
fond	1
of	1
tracing	1
their	1
books	1
to	1
some	1
recondite	1
source.	1
In	1
working	1
out	1
the	1
new	1
ideas,	1
he	1
soon	1
found	1
the	1
value	1
of	1
Sancho	1
Panza.	1
Indeed,	1
the	1
keynote,	1
not	1
only	1
to	1
Sancho’s	1
part,	1
but	1
to	1
the	1
whole	1
book,	1
is	1
struck	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
words	1
Sancho	1
utters	1
when	1
he	1
announces	1
his	1
intention	1
of	1
taking	1
his	1
ass	1
with	1
him.	1
“About	1
the	1
ass,”	1
we	1
are	1
told,	1
“Don	1
Quixote	1
hesitated	1
a	1
little,	1
trying	1
whether	1
he	1
could	1
call	1
to	1
mind	1
any	1
knight-errant	1
taking	1
with	1
him	1
an	1
esquire	1
mounted	1
on	1
ass-back;	1
but	1
no	1
instance	1
occurred	1
to	1
his	1
memory.”	1
We	1
can	1
see	1
the	1
whole	1
scene	1
at	1
a	1
glance,	1
the	1
stolid	1
unconsciousness	1
of	1
Sancho	1
and	1
the	1
perplexity	1
of	1
his	1
master,	1
upon	1
whose	1
perception	1
the	1
incongruity	1
has	1
just	1
forced	1
itself.	1
This	1
is	1
Sancho’s	1
mission	1
throughout	1
the	1
book;	1
he	1
is	1
an	1
unconscious	1
Mephistopheles,	1
always	1
unwittingly	1
making	1
mockery	1
of	1
his	1
master’s	1
aspirations,	1
always	1
exposing	1
the	1
fallacy	1
of	1
his	1
ideas	1
by	1
some	1
unintentional	1
ad	1
absurdum,	1
always	1
bringing	1
him	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
world	1
of	1
fact	1
and	1
commonplace	1
by	1
force	1
of	1
sheer	1
stolidity.	1
By	1
the	1
time	1
Cervantes	1
had	1
got	1
his	1
volume	1
of	1
novels	1
off	1
his	1
hands,	1
and	1
summoned	1
up	1
resolution	1
enough	1
to	1
set	1
about	1
the	1
Second	1
Part	1
in	1
earnest,	1
the	1
case	1
was	1
very	1
much	1
altered.	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
and	1
Sancho	1
Panza	1
had	1
not	1
merely	1
found	1
favour,	1
but	1
had	1
already	1
become,	1
what	1
they	1
have	1
never	1
since	1
ceased	1
to	1
be,	1
veritable	1
entities	1
to	1
the	1
popular	1
imagination.	1
There	1
was	1
no	1
occasion	1
for	1
him	1
now	1
to	1
interpolate	1
extraneous	1
matter;	1
nay,	1
his	1
readers	1
told	1
him	1
plainly	1
that	1
what	1
they	1
wanted	1
of	1
him	1
was	1
more	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
and	1
more	1
Sancho	1
Panza,	1
and	1
not	1
novels,	1
tales,	1
or	1
digressions.	1
To	1
himself,	1
too,	1
his	1
creations	1
had	1
become	1
realities,	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
become	1
proud	1
of	1
them,	1
especially	1
of	1
Sancho.	1
He	1
began	1
the	1
Second	1
Part,	1
therefore,	1
under	1
very	1
different	1
conditions,	1
and	1
the	1
difference	1
makes	1
itself	1
manifest	1
at	1
once.	1
Even	1
in	1
translation	1
the	1
style	1
will	1
be	1
seen	1
to	1
be	1
far	1
easier,	1
more	1
flowing,	1
more	1
natural,	1
and	1
more	1
like	1
that	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
sure	1
of	1
himself	1
and	1
of	1
his	1
audience.	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
and	1
Sancho	1
undergo	1
a	1
change	1
also.	1
In	1
the	1
First	1
Part,	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
has	1
no	1
character	1
or	1
individuality	1
whatever.	1
He	1
is	1
nothing	1
more	1
than	1
a	1
crazy	1
representative	1
of	1
the	1
sentiments	1
of	1
the	1
chivalry	1
romances.	1
In	1
all	1
that	1
he	1
says	1
and	1
does	1
he	1
is	1
simply	1
repeating	1
the	1
lesson	1
he	1
has	1
learned	1
from	1
his	1
books;	1
and	1
therefore,	1
it	1
is	1
absurd	1
to	1
speak	1
of	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
gushing	1
strain	1
of	1
the	1
sentimental	1
critics	1
when	1
they	1
dilate	1
upon	1
his	1
nobleness,	1
disinterestedness,	1
dauntless	1
courage,	1
and	1
so	1
forth.	1
It	1
was	1
the	1
business	1
of	1
a	1
knight-errant	1
to	1
right	1
wrongs,	1
redress	1
injuries,	1
and	1
succour	1
the	1
distressed,	1
and	1
this,	1
as	1
a	1
matter	1
of	1
course,	1
he	1
makes	1
his	1
business	1
when	1
he	1
takes	1
up	1
the	1
part;	1
a	1
knight-errant	1
was	1
bound	1
to	1
be	1
intrepid,	1
and	1
so	1
he	1
feels	1
bound	1
to	1
cast	1
fear	1
aside.	1
Of	1
all	1
Byron’s	1
melodious	1
nonsense	1
about	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
the	1
most	1
nonsensical	1
statement	1
is	1
that	1
“’tis	1
his	1
virtue	1
makes	1
him	1
mad!”	1
The	1
exact	1
opposite	1
is	1
the	1
truth;	1
it	1
is	1
his	1
madness	1
makes	1
him	1
virtuous.	1
In	1
the	1
Second	1
Part,	1
Cervantes	1
repeatedly	1
reminds	1
the	1
reader,	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
point	1
upon	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
anxious	1
there	1
should	1
be	1
no	1
mistake,	1
that	1
his	1
hero’s	1
madness	1
is	1
strictly	1
confined	1
to	1
delusions	1
on	1
the	1
subject	1
of	1
chivalry,	1
and	1
that	1
on	1
every	1
other	1
subject	1
he	1
is	1
discreto,	1
one,	1
in	1
fact,	1
whose	1
faculty	1
of	1
discernment	1
is	1
in	1
perfect	1
order.	1
The	1
advantage	1
of	1
this	1
is	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
enabled	1
to	1
make	1
use	1
of	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
as	1
a	1
mouthpiece	1
for	1
his	1
own	1
reflections,	1
and	1
so,	1
without	1
seeming	1
to	1
digress,	1
allow	1
himself	1
the	1
relief	1
of	1
digression	1
when	1
he	1
requires	1
it,	1
as	1
freely	1
as	1
in	1
a	1
commonplace	1
book.	1
It	1
is	1
true	1
the	1
amount	1
of	1
individuality	1
bestowed	1
upon	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
is	1
not	1
very	1
great.	1
There	1
are	1
some	1
natural	1
touches	1
of	1
character	1
about	1
him,	1
such	1
as	1
his	1
mixture	1
of	1
irascibility	1
and	1
placability,	1
and	1
his	1
curious	1
affection	1
for	1
Sancho	1
together	1
with	1
his	1
impatience	1
of	1
the	1
squire’s	1
loquacity	1
and	1
impertinence;	1
but	1
in	1
the	1
main,	1
apart	1
from	1
his	1
craze,	1
he	1
is	1
little	1
more	1
than	1
a	1
thoughtful,	1
cultured	1
gentleman,	1
with	1
instinctive	1
good	1
taste	1
and	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
of	1
shrewdness	1
and	1
originality	1
of	1
mind.	1
As	1
to	1
Sancho,	1
it	1
is	1
plain,	1
from	1
the	1
concluding	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
preface	1
to	1
the	1
First	1
Part,	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
favourite	1
with	1
his	1
creator	1
even	1
before	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
taken	1
into	1
favour	1
by	1
the	1
public.	1
An	1
inferior	1
genius,	1
taking	1
him	1
in	1
hand	1
a	1
second	1
time,	1
would	1
very	1
likely	1
have	1
tried	1
to	1
improve	1
him	1
by	1
making	1
him	1
more	1
comical,	1
clever,	1
amiable,	1
or	1
virtuous.	1
But	1
Cervantes	1
was	1
too	1
true	1
an	1
artist	1
to	1
spoil	1
his	1
work	1
in	1
this	1
way.	1
Sancho,	1
when	1
he	1
reappears,	1
is	1
the	1
old	1
Sancho	1
with	1
the	1
old	1
familiar	1
features;	1
but	1
with	1
a	1
difference;	1
they	1
have	1
been	1
brought	1
out	1
more	1
distinctly,	1
but	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
with	1
a	1
careful	1
avoidance	1
of	1
anything	1
like	1
caricature;	1
the	1
outline	1
has	1
been	1
filled	1
in	1
where	1
filling	1
in	1
was	1
necessary,	1
and,	1
vivified	1
by	1
a	1
few	1
touches	1
of	1
a	1
master’s	1
hand,	1
Sancho	1
stands	1
before	1
us	1
as	1
he	1
might	1
in	1
a	1
character	1
portrait	1
by	1
Velazquez.	1
He	1
is	1
a	1
much	1
more	1
important	1
and	1
prominent	1
figure	1
in	1
the	1
Second	1
Part	1
than	1
in	1
the	1
First;	1
indeed,	1
it	1
is	1
his	1
matchless	1
mendacity	1
about	1
Dulcinea	1
that	1
to	1
a	1
great	1
extent	1
supplies	1
the	1
action	1
of	1
the	1
story.	1
His	1
development	1
in	1
this	1
respect	1
is	1
as	1
remarkable	1
as	1
in	1
any	1
other.	1
In	1
the	1
First	1
Part	1
he	1
displays	1
a	1
great	1
natural	1
gift	1
of	1
lying.	1
His	1
lies	1
are	1
not	1
of	1
the	1
highly	1
imaginative	1
sort	1
that	1
liars	1
in	1
fiction	1
commonly	1
indulge	1
in;	1
like	1
Falstaff’s,	1
they	1
resemble	1
the	1
father	1
that	1
begets	1
them;	1
they	1
are	1
simple,	1
homely,	1
plump	1
lies;	1
plain	1
working	1
lies,	1
in	1
short.	1
But	1
in	1
the	1
service	1
of	1
such	1
a	1
master	1
as	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
he	1
develops	1
rapidly,	1
as	1
we	1
see	1
when	1
he	1
comes	1
to	1
palm	1
off	1
the	1
three	1
country	1
wenches	1
as	1
Dulcinea	1
and	1
her	1
ladies	1
in	1
waiting.	1
It	1
is	1
worth	1
noticing	1
how,	1
flushed	1
by	1
his	1
success	1
in	1
this	1
instance,	1
he	1
is	1
tempted	1
afterwards	1
to	1
try	1
a	1
flight	1
beyond	1
his	1
powers	1
in	1
his	1
account	1
of	1
the	1
journey	1
on	1
Clavileño.	1
In	1
the	1
Second	1
Part	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
spirit	1
rather	1
than	1
the	1
incidents	1
of	1
the	1
chivalry	1
romances	1
that	1
is	1
the	1
subject	1
of	1
the	1
burlesque.	1
Enchantments	1
of	1
the	1
sort	1
travestied	1
in	1
those	1
of	1
Dulcinea	1
and	1
the	1
Trifaldi	1
and	1
the	1
cave	1
of	1
Montesinos	1
play	1
a	1
leading	1
part	1
in	1
the	1
later	1
and	1
inferior	1
romances,	1
and	1
another	1
distinguishing	1
feature	1
is	1
caricatured	1
in	1
Don	1
Quixote’s	1
blind	1
adoration	1
of	1
Dulcinea.	1
In	1
the	1
romances	1
of	1
chivalry	1
love	1
is	1
either	1
a	1
mere	1
animalism	1
or	1
a	1
fantastic	1
idolatry.	1
Only	1
a	1
coarse-minded	1
man	1
would	1
care	1
to	1
make	1
merry	1
with	1
the	1
former,	1
but	1
to	1
one	1
of	1
Cervantes’	1
humour	1
the	1
latter	1
was	1
naturally	1
an	1
attractive	1
subject	1
for	1
ridicule.	1
Like	1
everything	1
else	1
in	1
these	1
romances,	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
gross	1
exaggeration	1
of	1
the	1
real	1
sentiment	1
of	1
chivalry,	1
but	1
its	1
peculiar	1
extravagance	1
is	1
probably	1
due	1
to	1
the	1
influence	1
of	1
those	1
masters	1
of	1
hyperbole,	1
the	1
Provencal	1
poets.	1
When	1
a	1
troubadour	1
professed	1
his	1
readiness	1
to	1
obey	1
his	1
lady	1
in	1
all	1
things,	1
he	1
made	1
it	1
incumbent	1
upon	1
the	1
next	1
comer,	1
if	1
he	1
wished	1
to	1
avoid	1
the	1
imputation	1
of	1
tameness	1
and	1
commonplace,	1
to	1
declare	1
himself	1
the	1
slave	1
of	1
her	1
will,	1
which	1
the	1
next	1
was	1
compelled	1
to	1
cap	1
by	1
some	1
still	1
stronger	1
declaration;	1
and	1
so	1
expressions	1
of	1
devotion	1
went	1
on	1
rising	1
one	1
above	1
the	1
other	1
like	1
biddings	1
at	1
an	1
auction,	1
and	1
a	1
conventional	1
language	1
of	1
gallantry	1
and	1
theory	1
of	1
love	1
came	1
into	1
being	1
that	1
in	1
time	1
permeated	1
the	1
literature	1
of	1
Southern	1
Europe,	1
and	1
bore	1
fruit,	1
in	1
one	1
direction	1
in	1
the	1
transcendental	1
worship	1
of	1
Beatrice	1
and	1
Laura,	1
and	1
in	1
another	1
in	1
the	1
grotesque	1
idolatry	1
which	1
found	1
exponents	1
in	1
writers	1
like	1
Feliciano	1
de	1
Silva.	1
This	1
is	1
what	1
Cervantes	1
deals	1
with	1
in	1
Don	1
Quixote’s	1
passion	1
for	1
Dulcinea,	1
and	1
in	1
no	1
instance	1
has	1
he	1
carried	1
out	1
the	1
burlesque	1
more	1
happily.	1
By	1
keeping	1
Dulcinea	1
in	1
the	1
background,	1
and	1
making	1
her	1
a	1
vague	1
shadowy	1
being	1
of	1
whose	1
very	1
existence	1
we	1
are	1
left	1
in	1
doubt,	1
he	1
invests	1
Don	1
Quixote’s	1
worship	1
of	1
her	1
virtues	1
and	1
charms	1
with	1
an	1
additional	1
extravagance,	1
and	1
gives	1
still	1
more	1
point	1
to	1
the	1
caricature	1
of	1
the	1
sentiment	1
and	1
language	1
of	1
the	1
romances.	1
One	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
merits	1
of	1
“Don	1
Quixote,”	1
and	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
qualities	1
that	1
have	1
secured	1
its	1
acceptance	1
by	1
all	1
classes	1
of	1
readers	1
and	1
made	1
it	1
the	1
most	1
cosmopolitan	1
of	1
books,	1
is	1
its	1
simplicity.	1
There	1
are,	1
of	1
course,	1
points	1
obvious	1
enough	1
to	1
a	1
Spanish	1
seventeenth	1
century	1
audience	1
which	1
do	1
not	1
immediately	1
strike	1
a	1
reader	1
now-a-days,	1
and	1
Cervantes	1
often	1
takes	1
it	1
for	1
granted	1
that	1
an	1
allusion	1
will	1
be	1
generally	1
understood	1
which	1
is	1
only	1
intelligible	1
to	1
a	1
few.	1
For	1
example,	1
on	1
many	1
of	1
his	1
readers	1
in	1
Spain,	1
and	1
most	1
of	1
his	1
readers	1
out	1
of	1
it,	1
the	1
significance	1
of	1
his	1
choice	1
of	1
a	1
country	1
for	1
his	1
hero	1
is	1
completely	1
lost.	1
It	1
would	1
be	1
going	1
too	1
far	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
no	1
one	1
can	1
thoroughly	1
comprehend	1
“Don	1
Quixote”	1
without	1
having	1
seen	1
La	1
Mancha,	1
but	1
undoubtedly	1
even	1
a	1
glimpse	1
of	1
La	1
Mancha	1
will	1
give	1
an	1
insight	1
into	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
Cervantes	1
such	1
as	1
no	1
commentator	1
can	1
give.	1
Of	1
all	1
the	1
regions	1
of	1
Spain	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
last	1
that	1
would	1
suggest	1
the	1
idea	1
of	1
romance.	1
Of	1
all	1
the	1
dull	1
central	1
plateau	1
of	1
the	1
Peninsula	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
dullest	1
tract.	1
There	1
is	1
something	1
impressive	1
about	1
the	1
grim	1
solitudes	1
of	1
Estremadura;	1
and	1
if	1
the	1
plains	1
of	1
Leon	1
and	1
Old	1
Castile	1
are	1
bald	1
and	1
dreary,	1
they	1
are	1
studded	1
with	1
old	1
cities	1
renowned	1
in	1
history	1
and	1
rich	1
in	1
relics	1
of	1
the	1
past.	1
But	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
redeeming	1
feature	1
in	1
the	1
Manchegan	1
landscape;	1
it	1
has	1
all	1
the	1
sameness	1
of	1
the	1
desert	1
without	1
its	1
dignity;	1
the	1
few	1
towns	1
and	1
villages	1
that	1
break	1
its	1
monotony	1
are	1
mean	1
and	1
commonplace,	1
there	1
is	1
nothing	1
venerable	1
about	1
them,	1
they	1
have	1
not	1
even	1
the	1
picturesqueness	1
of	1
poverty;	1
indeed,	1
Don	1
Quixote’s	1
own	1
village,	1
Argamasilla,	1
has	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
oppressive	1
respectability	1
in	1
the	1
prim	1
regularity	1
of	1
its	1
streets	1
and	1
houses;	1
everything	1
is	1
ignoble;	1
the	1
very	1
windmills	1
are	1
the	1
ugliest	1
and	1
shabbiest	1
of	1
the	1
windmill	1
kind.	1
To	1
anyone	1
who	1
knew	1
the	1
country	1
well,	1
the	1
mere	1
style	1
and	1
title	1
of	1
“Don	1
Quixote	1
of	1
La	1
Mancha”	1
gave	1
the	1
key	1
to	1
the	1
author’s	1
meaning	1
at	1
once.	1
La	1
Mancha	1
as	1
the	1
knight’s	1
country	1
and	1
scene	1
of	1
his	1
chivalries	1
is	1
of	1
a	1
piece	1
with	1
the	1
pasteboard	1
helmet,	1
the	1
farm-labourer	1
on	1
ass-back	1
for	1
a	1
squire,	1
knighthood	1
conferred	1
by	1
a	1
rascally	1
ventero,	1
convicts	1
taken	1
for	1
victims	1
of	1
oppression,	1
and	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
incongruities	1
between	1
Don	1
Quixote’s	1
world	1
and	1
the	1
world	1
he	1
lived	1
in,	1
between	1
things	1
as	1
he	1
saw	1
them	1
and	1
things	1
as	1
they	1
were.	1
It	1
is	1
strange	1
that	1
this	1
element	1
of	1
incongruity,	1
underlying	1
the	1
whole	1
humour	1
and	1
purpose	1
of	1
the	1
book,	1
should	1
have	1
been	1
so	1
little	1
heeded	1
by	1
the	1
majority	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
have	1
undertaken	1
to	1
interpret	1
“Don	1
Quixote.”	1
It	1
has	1
been	1
completely	1
overlooked,	1
for	1
example,	1
by	1
the	1
illustrators.	1
To	1
be	1
sure,	1
the	1
great	1
majority	1
of	1
the	1
artists	1
who	1
illustrated	1
“Don	1
Quixote”	1
knew	1
nothing	1
whatever	1
of	1
Spain.	1
To	1
them	1
a	1
venta	1
conveyed	1
no	1
idea	1
but	1
the	1
abstract	1
one	1
of	1
a	1
roadside	1
inn,	1
and	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
therefore	1
do	1
full	1
justice	1
to	1
the	1
humour	1
of	1
Don	1
Quixote’s	1
misconception	1
in	1
taking	1
it	1
for	1
a	1
castle,	1
or	1
perceive	1
the	1
remoteness	1
of	1
all	1
its	1
realities	1
from	1
his	1
ideal.	1
But	1
even	1
when	1
better	1
informed	1
they	1
seem	1
to	1
have	1
no	1
apprehension	1
of	1
the	1
full	1
force	1
of	1
the	1
discrepancy.	1
Take,	1
for	1
instance,	1
Gustave	1
Doré’s	1
drawing	1
of	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
watching	1
his	1
armour	1
in	1
the	1
inn-yard.	1
Whether	1
or	1
not	1
the	1
Venta	1
de	1
Quesada	1
on	1
the	1
Seville	1
road	1
is,	1
as	1
tradition	1
maintains,	1
the	1
inn	1
described	1
in	1
“Don	1
Quixote,”	1
beyond	1
all	1
question	1
it	1
was	1
just	1
such	1
an	1
inn-yard	1
as	1
the	1
one	1
behind	1
it	1
that	1
Cervantes	1
had	1
in	1
his	1
mind’s	1
eye,	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
on	1
just	1
such	1
a	1
rude	1
stone	1
trough	1
as	1
that	1
beside	1
the	1
primitive	1
draw-well	1
in	1
the	1
corner	1
that	1
he	1
meant	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
to	1
deposit	1
his	1
armour.	1
Gustave	1
Doré	1
makes	1
it	1
an	1
elaborate	1
fountain	1
such	1
as	1
no	1
arriero	1
ever	1
watered	1
his	1
mules	1
at	1
in	1
the	1
corral	1
of	1
any	1
venta	1
in	1
Spain,	1
and	1
thereby	1
entirely	1
misses	1
the	1
point	1
aimed	1
at	1
by	1
Cervantes.	1
It	1
is	1
the	1
mean,	1
prosaic,	1
commonplace	1
character	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
surroundings	1
and	1
circumstances	1
that	1
gives	1
a	1
significance	1
to	1
Don	1
Quixote’s	1
vigil	1
and	1
the	1
ceremony	1
that	1
follows.	1
Cervantes’	1
humour	1
is	1
for	1
the	1
most	1
part	1
of	1
that	1
broader	1
and	1
simpler	1
sort,	1
the	1
strength	1
of	1
which	1
lies	1
in	1
the	1
perception	1
of	1
the	1
incongruous.	1
It	1
is	1
the	1
incongruity	1
of	1
Sancho	1
in	1
all	1
his	1
ways,	1
words,	1
and	1
works,	1
with	1
the	1
ideas	1
and	1
aims	1
of	1
his	1
master,	1
quite	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
the	1
wonderful	1
vitality	1
and	1
truth	1
to	1
nature	1
of	1
the	1
character,	1
that	1
makes	1
him	1
the	1
most	1
humorous	1
creation	1
in	1
the	1
whole	1
range	1
of	1
fiction.	1
That	1
unsmiling	1
gravity	1
of	1
which	1
Cervantes	1
was	1
the	1
first	1
great	1
master,	1
“Cervantes’	1
serious	1
air,”	1
which	1
sits	1
naturally	1
on	1
Swift	1
alone,	1
perhaps,	1
of	1
later	1
humourists,	1
is	1
essential	1
to	1
this	1
kind	1
of	1
humour,	1
and	1
here	1
again	1
Cervantes	1
has	1
suffered	1
at	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
his	1
interpreters.	1
Nothing,	1
unless	1
indeed	1
the	1
coarse	1
buffoonery	1
of	1
Phillips,	1
could	1
be	1
more	1
out	1
of	1
place	1
in	1
an	1
attempt	1
to	1
represent	1
Cervantes,	1
than	1
a	1
flippant,	1
would-be	1
facetious	1
style,	1
like	1
that	1
of	1
Motteux’s	1
version	1
for	1
example,	1
or	1
the	1
sprightly,	1
jaunty	1
air,	1
French	1
translators	1
sometimes	1
adopt.	1
It	1
is	1
the	1
grave	1
matter-of-factness	1
of	1
the	1
narrative,	1
and	1
the	1
apparent	1
unconsciousness	1
of	1
the	1
author	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
saying	1
anything	1
ludicrous,	1
anything	1
but	1
the	1
merest	1
commonplace,	1
that	1
give	1
its	1
peculiar	1
flavour	1
to	1
the	1
humour	1
of	1
Cervantes.	1
His,	1
in	1
fact,	1
is	1
the	1
exact	1
opposite	1
of	1
the	1
humour	1
of	1
Sterne	1
and	1
the	1
self-conscious	1
humourists.	1
Even	1
when	1
Uncle	1
Toby	1
is	1
at	1
his	1
best,	1
you	1
are	1
always	1
aware	1
of	1
“the	1
man	1
Sterne”	1
behind	1
him,	1
watching	1
you	1
over	1
his	1
shoulder	1
to	1
see	1
what	1
effect	1
he	1
is	1
producing.	1
Cervantes	1
always	1
leaves	1
you	1
alone	1
with	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
and	1
Sancho.	1
He	1
and	1
Swift	1
and	1
the	1
great	1
humourists	1
always	1
keep	1
themselves	1
out	1
of	1
sight,	1
or,	1
more	1
properly	1
speaking,	1
never	1
think	1
about	1
themselves	1
at	1
all,	1
unlike	1
our	1
latter-day	1
school	1
of	1
humourists,	1
who	1
seem	1
to	1
have	1
revived	1
the	1
old	1
horse-collar	1
method,	1
and	1
try	1
to	1
raise	1
a	1
laugh	1
by	1
some	1
grotesque	1
assumption	1
of	1
ignorance,	1
imbecility,	1
or	1
bad	1
taste.	1
It	1
is	1
true	1
that	1
to	1
do	1
full	1
justice	1
to	1
Spanish	1
humour	1
in	1
any	1
other	1
language	1
is	1
well-nigh	1
an	1
impossibility.	1
There	1
is	1
a	1
natural	1
gravity	1
and	1
a	1
sonorous	1
stateliness	1
about	1
Spanish,	1
be	1
it	1
ever	1
so	1
colloquial,	1
that	1
make	1
an	1
absurdity	1
doubly	1
absurd,	1
and	1
give	1
plausibility	1
to	1
the	1
most	1
preposterous	1
statement.	1
This	1
is	1
what	1
makes	1
Sancho	1
Panza’s	1
drollery	1
the	1
despair	1
of	1
the	1
conscientious	1
translator.	1
Sancho’s	1
curt	1
comments	1
can	1
never	1
fall	1
flat,	1
but	1
they	1
lose	1
half	1
their	1
flavour	1
when	1
transferred	1
from	1
their	1
native	1
Castilian	1
into	1
any	1
other	1
medium.	1
But	1
if	1
foreigners	1
have	1
failed	1
to	1
do	1
justice	1
to	1
the	1
humour	1
of	1
Cervantes,	1
they	1
are	1
no	1
worse	1
than	1
his	1
own	1
countrymen.	1
Indeed,	1
were	1
it	1
not	1
for	1
the	1
Spanish	1
peasant’s	1
relish	1
of	1
“Don	1
Quixote,”	1
one	1
might	1
be	1
tempted	1
to	1
think	1
that	1
the	1
great	1
humourist	1
was	1
not	1
looked	1
upon	1
as	1
a	1
humourist	1
at	1
all	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
country.	1
The	1
craze	1
of	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
seems,	1
in	1
some	1
instances,	1
to	1
have	1
communicated	1
itself	1
to	1
his	1
critics,	1
making	1
them	1
see	1
things	1
that	1
are	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
book	1
and	1
run	1
full	1
tilt	1
at	1
phantoms	1
that	1
have	1
no	1
existence	1
save	1
in	1
their	1
own	1
imaginations.	1
Like	1
a	1
good	1
many	1
critics	1
now-a-days,	1
they	1
forget	1
that	1
screams	1
are	1
not	1
criticism,	1
and	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
only	1
vulgar	1
tastes	1
that	1
are	1
influenced	1
by	1
strings	1
of	1
superlatives,	1
three-piled	1
hyperboles,	1
and	1
pompous	1
epithets.	1
But	1
what	1
strikes	1
one	1
as	1
particularly	1
strange	1
is	1
that	1
while	1
they	1
deal	1
in	1
extravagant	1
eulogies,	1
and	1
ascribe	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
imaginary	1
ideas	1
and	1
qualities	1
to	1
Cervantes,	1
they	1
show	1
no	1
perception	1
of	1
the	1
quality	1
that	1
ninety-nine	1
out	1
of	1
a	1
hundred	1
of	1
his	1
readers	1
would	1
rate	1
highest	1
in	1
him,	1
and	1
hold	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
one	1
that	1
raises	1
him	1
above	1
all	1
rivalry.	1
To	1
speak	1
of	1
“Don	1
Quixote”	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
merely	1
a	1
humorous	1
book	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
manifest	1
misdescription.	1
Cervantes	1
at	1
times	1
makes	1
it	1
a	1
kind	1
of	1
commonplace	1
book	1
for	1
occasional	1
essays	1
and	1
criticisms,	1
or	1
for	1
the	1
observations	1
and	1
reflections	1
and	1
gathered	1
wisdom	1
of	1
a	1
long	1
and	1
stirring	1
life.	1
It	1
is	1
a	1
mine	1
of	1
shrewd	1
observation	1
on	1
mankind	1
and	1
human	1
nature.	1
Among	1
modern	1
novels	1
there	1
may	1
be,	1
here	1
and	1
there,	1
more	1
elaborate	1
studies	1
of	1
character,	1
but	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
book	1
richer	1
in	1
individualised	1
character.	1
What	1
Coleridge	1
said	1
of	1
Shakespeare	1
in	1
minimis	1
is	1
true	1
of	1
Cervantes;	1
he	1
never,	1
even	1
for	1
the	1
most	1
temporary	1
purpose,	1
puts	1
forward	1
a	1
lay	1
figure.	1
There	1
is	1
life	1
and	1
individuality	1
in	1
all	1
his	1
characters,	1
however	1
little	1
they	1
may	1
have	1
to	1
do,	1
or	1
however	1
short	1
a	1
time	1
they	1
may	1
be	1
before	1
the	1
reader.	1
Samson	1
Carrasco,	1
the	1
curate,	1
Teresa	1
Panza,	1
Altisidora,	1
even	1
the	1
two	1
students	1
met	1
on	1
the	1
road	1
to	1
the	1
cave	1
of	1
Montesinos,	1
all	1
live	1
and	1
move	1
and	1
have	1
their	1
being;	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
characteristic	1
of	1
the	1
broad	1
humanity	1
of	1
Cervantes	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
hateful	1
one	1
among	1
them	1
all.	1
Even	1
poor	1
Maritornes,	1
with	1
her	1
deplorable	1
morals,	1
has	1
a	1
kind	1
heart	1
of	1
her	1
own	1
and	1
“some	1
faint	1
and	1
distant	1
resemblance	1
to	1
a	1
Christian	1
about	1
her;”	1
and	1
as	1
for	1
Sancho,	1
though	1
on	1
dissection	1
we	1
fail	1
to	1
find	1
a	1
lovable	1
trait	1
in	1
him,	1
unless	1
it	1
be	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
dog-like	1
affection	1
for	1
his	1
master,	1
who	1
is	1
there	1
that	1
in	1
his	1
heart	1
does	1
not	1
love	1
him?	1
But	1
it	1
is,	1
after	1
all,	1
the	1
humour	1
of	1
“Don	1
Quixote”	1
that	1
distinguishes	1
it	1
from	1
all	1
other	1
books	1
of	1
the	1
romance	1
kind.	1
It	1
is	1
this	1
that	1
makes	1
it,	1
as	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
judicial-minded	1
of	1
modern	1
critics	1
calls	1
it,	1
“the	1
best	1
novel	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
beyond	1
all	1
comparison.”	1
It	1
is	1
its	1
varied	1
humour,	1
ranging	1
from	1
broad	1
farce	1
to	1
comedy	1
as	1
subtle	1
as	1
Shakespeare’s	1
or	1
Molière’s	1
that	1
has	1
naturalised	1
it	1
in	1
every	1
country	1
where	1
there	1
are	1
readers,	1
and	1
made	1
it	1
a	1
classic	1
in	1
every	1
language	1
that	1
has	1
a	1
literature.	1
THE	1
AUTHOR’S	1
PREFACE	1
Idle	1
reader:	1
thou	1
mayest	1
believe	1
me	1
without	1
any	1
oath	1
that	1
I	1
would	1
this	1
book,	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
child	1
of	1
my	1
brain,	1
were	1
the	1
fairest,	1
gayest,	1
and	1
cleverest	1
that	1
could	1
be	1
imagined.	1
But	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
counteract	1
Nature’s	1
law	1
that	1
everything	1
shall	1
beget	1
its	1
like;	1
and	1
what,	1
then,	1
could	1
this	1
sterile,	1
illtilled	1
wit	1
of	1
mine	1
beget	1
but	1
the	1
story	1
of	1
a	1
dry,	1
shrivelled,	1
whimsical	1
offspring,	1
full	1
of	1
thoughts	1
of	1
all	1
sorts	1
and	1
such	1
as	1
never	1
came	1
into	1
any	1
other	1
imagination—just	1
what	1
might	1
be	1
begotten	1
in	1
a	1
prison,	1
where	1
every	1
misery	1
is	1
lodged	1
and	1
every	1
doleful	1
sound	1
makes	1
its	1
dwelling?	1
Tranquillity,	1
a	1
cheerful	1
retreat,	1
pleasant	1
fields,	1
bright	1
skies,	1
murmuring	1
brooks,	1
peace	1
of	1
mind,	1
these	1
are	1
the	1
things	1
that	1
go	1
far	1
to	1
make	1
even	1
the	1
most	1
barren	1
muses	1
fertile,	1
and	1
bring	1
into	1
the	1
world	1
births	1
that	1
fill	1
it	1
with	1
wonder	1
and	1
delight.	1
Sometimes	1
when	1
a	1
father	1
has	1
an	1
ugly,	1
loutish	1
son,	1
the	1
love	1
he	1
bears	1
him	1
so	1
blindfolds	1
his	1
eyes	1
that	1
he	1
does	1
not	1
see	1
his	1
defects,	1
or,	1
rather,	1
takes	1
them	1
for	1
gifts	1
and	1
charms	1
of	1
mind	1
and	1
body,	1
and	1
talks	1
of	1
them	1
to	1
his	1
friends	1
as	1
wit	1
and	1
grace.	1
I,	1
however—for	1
though	1
I	1
pass	1
for	1
the	1
father,	1
I	1
am	1
but	1
the	1
stepfather	1
to	1
“Don	1
Quixote”—have	1
no	1
desire	1
to	1
go	1
with	1
the	1
current	1
of	1
custom,	1
or	1
to	1
implore	1
thee,	1
dearest	1
reader,	1
almost	1
with	1
tears	1
in	1
my	1
eyes,	1
as	1
others	1
do,	1
to	1
pardon	1
or	1
excuse	1
the	1
defects	1
thou	1
wilt	1
perceive	1
in	1
this	1
child	1
of	1
mine.	1
Thou	1
art	1
neither	1
its	1
kinsman	1
nor	1
its	1
friend,	1
thy	1
soul	1
is	1
thine	1
own	1
and	1
thy	1
will	1
as	1
free	1
as	1
any	1
man’s,	1
whate’er	1
he	1
be,	1
thou	1
art	1
in	1
thine	1
own	1
house	1
and	1
master	1
of	1
it	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
his	1
taxes	1
and	1
thou	1
knowest	1
the	1
common	1
saying,	1
“Under	1
my	1
cloak	1
I	1
kill	1
the	1
king;”	1
all	1
which	1
exempts	1
and	1
frees	1
thee	1
from	1
every	1
consideration	1
and	1
obligation,	1
and	1
thou	1
canst	1
say	1
what	1
thou	1
wilt	1
of	1
the	1
story	1
without	1
fear	1
of	1
being	1
abused	1
for	1
any	1
ill	1
or	1
rewarded	1
for	1
any	1
good	1
thou	1
mayest	1
say	1
of	1
it.	1
My	1
wish	1
would	1
be	1
simply	1
to	1
present	1
it	1
to	1
thee	1
plain	1
and	1
unadorned,	1
without	1
any	1
embellishment	1
of	1
preface	1
or	1
uncountable	1
muster	1
of	1
customary	1
sonnets,	1
epigrams,	1
and	1
eulogies,	1
such	1
as	1
are	1
commonly	1
put	1
at	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
books.	1
For	1
I	1
can	1
tell	1
thee,	1
though	1
composing	1
it	1
cost	1
me	1
some	1
labour,	1
I	1
found	1
none	1
greater	1
than	1
the	1
making	1
of	1
this	1
Preface	1
thou	1
art	1
now	1
reading.	1
Many	1
times	1
did	1
I	1
take	1
up	1
my	1
pen	1
to	1
write	1
it,	1
and	1
many	1
did	1
I	1
lay	1
it	1
down	1
again,	1
not	1
knowing	1
what	1
to	1
write.	1
One	1
of	1
these	1
times,	1
as	1
I	1
was	1
pondering	1
with	1
the	1
paper	1
before	1
me,	1
a	1
pen	1
in	1
my	1
ear,	1
my	1
elbow	1
on	1
the	1
desk,	1
and	1
my	1
cheek	1
in	1
my	1
hand,	1
thinking	1
of	1
what	1
I	1
should	1
say,	1
there	1
came	1
in	1
unexpectedly	1
a	1
certain	1
lively,	1
clever	1
friend	1
of	1
mine,	1
who,	1
seeing	1
me	1
so	1
deep	1
in	1
thought,	1
asked	1
the	1
reason;	1
to	1
which	1
I,	1
making	1
no	1
mystery	1
of	1
it,	1
answered	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
thinking	1
of	1
the	1
Preface	1
I	1
had	1
to	1
make	1
for	1
the	1
story	1
of	1
“Don	1
Quixote,”	1
which	1
so	1
troubled	1
me	1
that	1
I	1
had	1
a	1
mind	1
not	1
to	1
make	1
any	1
at	1
all,	1
nor	1
even	1
publish	1
the	1
achievements	1
of	1
so	1
noble	1
a	1
knight.	1
“For,	1
how	1
could	1
you	1
expect	1
me	1
not	1
to	1
feel	1
uneasy	1
about	1
what	1
that	1
ancient	1
lawgiver	1
they	1
call	1
the	1
Public	1
will	1
say	1
when	1
it	1
sees	1
me,	1
after	1
slumbering	1
so	1
many	1
years	1
in	1
the	1
silence	1
of	1
oblivion,	1
coming	1
out	1
now	1
with	1
all	1
my	1
years	1
upon	1
my	1
back,	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
book	1
as	1
dry	1
as	1
a	1
rush,	1
devoid	1
of	1
invention,	1
meagre	1
in	1
style,	1
poor	1
in	1
thoughts,	1
wholly	1
wanting	1
in	1
learning	1
and	1
wisdom,	1
without	1
quotations	1
in	1
the	1
margin	1
or	1
annotations	1
at	1
the	1
end,	1
after	1
the	1
fashion	1
of	1
other	1
books	1
I	1
see,	1
which,	1
though	1
all	1
fables	1
and	1
profanity,	1
are	1
so	1
full	1
of	1
maxims	1
from	1
Aristotle,	1
and	1
Plato,	1
and	1
the	1
whole	1
herd	1
of	1
philosophers,	1
that	1
they	1
fill	1
the	1
readers	1
with	1
amazement	1
and	1
convince	1
them	1
that	1
the	1
authors	1
are	1
men	1
of	1
learning,	1
erudition,	1
and	1
eloquence.	1
And	1
then,	1
when	1
they	1
quote	1
the	1
Holy	1
Scriptures!—anyone	1
would	1
say	1
they	1
are	1
St.	1
Thomases	1
or	1
other	1
doctors	1
of	1
the	1
Church,	1
observing	1
as	1
they	1
do	1
a	1
decorum	1
so	1
ingenious	1
that	1
in	1
one	1
sentence	1
they	1
describe	1
a	1
distracted	1
lover	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
next	1
deliver	1
a	1
devout	1
little	1
sermon	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
pleasure	1
and	1
a	1
treat	1
to	1
hear	1
and	1
read.	1
Of	1
all	1
this	1
there	1
will	1
be	1
nothing	1
in	1
my	1
book,	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
nothing	1
to	1
quote	1
in	1
the	1
margin	1
or	1
to	1
note	1
at	1
the	1
end,	1
and	1
still	1
less	1
do	1
I	1
know	1
what	1
authors	1
I	1
follow	1
in	1
it,	1
to	1
place	1
them	1
at	1
the	1
beginning,	1
as	1
all	1
do,	1
under	1
the	1
letters	1
A,	1
B,	1
C,	1
beginning	1
with	1
Aristotle	1
and	1
ending	1
with	1
Xenophon,	1
or	1
Zoilus,	1
or	1
Zeuxis,	1
though	1
one	1
was	1
a	1
slanderer	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
a	1
painter.	1
Also	1
my	1
book	1
must	1
do	1
without	1
sonnets	1
at	1
the	1
beginning,	1
at	1
least	1
sonnets	1
whose	1
authors	1
are	1
dukes,	1
marquises,	1
counts,	1
bishops,	1
ladies,	1
or	1
famous	1
poets.	1
Though	1
if	1
I	1
were	1
to	1
ask	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
obliging	1
friends,	1
I	1
know	1
they	1
would	1
give	1
me	1
them,	1
and	1
such	1
as	1
the	1
productions	1
of	1
those	1
that	1
have	1
the	1
highest	1
reputation	1
in	1
our	1
Spain	1
could	1
not	1
equal.	1
“In	1
short,	1
my	1
friend,”	1
I	1
continued,	1
“I	1
am	1
determined	1
that	1
Señor	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
shall	1
remain	1
buried	1
in	1
the	1
archives	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
La	1
Mancha	1
until	1
Heaven	1
provide	1
someone	1
to	1
garnish	1
him	1
with	1
all	1
those	1
things	1
he	1
stands	1
in	1
need	1
of;	1
because	1
I	1
find	1
myself,	1
through	1
my	1
shallowness	1
and	1
want	1
of	1
learning,	1
unequal	1
to	1
supplying	1
them,	1
and	1
because	1
I	1
am	1
by	1
nature	1
shy	1
and	1
careless	1
about	1
hunting	1
for	1
authors	1
to	1
say	1
what	1
I	1
myself	1
can	1
say	1
without	1
them.	1
Hence	1
the	1
cogitation	1
and	1
abstraction	1
you	1
found	1
me	1
in,	1
and	1
reason	1
enough,	1
what	1
you	1
have	1
heard	1
from	1
me.”	1
Hearing	1
this,	1
my	1
friend,	1
giving	1
himself	1
a	1
slap	1
on	1
the	1
forehead	1
and	1
breaking	1
into	1
a	1
hearty	1
laugh,	1
exclaimed,	1
“Before	1
God,	1
Brother,	1
now	1
am	1
I	1
disabused	1
of	1
an	1
error	1
in	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
living	1
all	1
this	1
long	1
time	1
I	1
have	1
known	1
you,	1
all	1
through	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
taken	1
you	1
to	1
be	1
shrewd	1
and	1
sensible	1
in	1
all	1
you	1
do;	1
but	1
now	1
I	1
see	1
you	1
are	1
as	1
far	1
from	1
that	1
as	1
the	1
heaven	1
is	1
from	1
the	1
earth.	1
It	1
is	1
possible	1
that	1
things	1
of	1
so	1
little	1
moment	1
and	1
so	1
easy	1
to	1
set	1
right	1
can	1
occupy	1
and	1
perplex	1
a	1
ripe	1
wit	1
like	1
yours,	1
fit	1
to	1
break	1
through	1
and	1
crush	1
far	1
greater	1
obstacles?	1
By	1
my	1
faith,	1
this	1
comes,	1
not	1
of	1
any	1
want	1
of	1
ability,	1
but	1
of	1
too	1
much	1
indolence	1
and	1
too	1
little	1
knowledge	1
of	1
life.	1
Do	1
you	1
want	1
to	1
know	1
if	1
I	1
am	1
telling	1
the	1
truth?	1
Well,	1
then,	1
attend	1
to	1
me,	1
and	1
you	1
will	1
see	1
how,	1
in	1
the	1
opening	1
and	1
shutting	1
of	1
an	1
eye,	1
I	1
sweep	1
away	1
all	1
your	1
difficulties,	1
and	1
supply	1
all	1
those	1
deficiencies	1
which	1
you	1
say	1
check	1
and	1
discourage	1
you	1
from	1
bringing	1
before	1
the	1
world	1
the	1
story	1
of	1
your	1
famous	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
the	1
light	1
and	1
mirror	1
of	1
all	1
knight-errantry.”	1
“Say	1
on,”	1
said	1
I,	1
listening	1
to	1
his	1
talk;	1
“how	1
do	1
you	1
propose	1
to	1
make	1
up	1
for	1
my	1
diffidence,	1
and	1
reduce	1
to	1
order	1
this	1
chaos	1
of	1
perplexity	1
I	1
am	1
in?”	1
To	1
which	1
he	1
made	1
answer,	1
“Your	1
first	1
difficulty	1
about	1
the	1
sonnets,	1
epigrams,	1
or	1
complimentary	1
verses	1
which	1
you	1
want	1
for	1
the	1
beginning,	1
and	1
which	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
by	1
persons	1
of	1
importance	1
and	1
rank,	1
can	1
be	1
removed	1
if	1
you	1
yourself	1
take	1
a	1
little	1
trouble	1
to	1
make	1
them;	1
you	1
can	1
afterwards	1
baptise	1

“With	1

adding	1
annotations	1
at	1
the	1

you	1
may	1
safely	1
do	1
it	1
in	1
this	1

If	1

any	1
giant	1
in	1

contrive	1
that	1
it	1
shall	1

with	1
this	1
alone,	1
which	1
will	1
cost	1
you	1
almost	1
nothing,	1
you	1
have	1
a	1

note,	1
for	1
you	1
can	1
put—_The	1

in	1
the	1

the	1

I	1
have	1
it	1
by	1
heart;	1

any	1

if	1
you	1

not	1

go	1
to	1
foreign	1

you	1
have	1
at	1

Fonseca’s	1
‘Of	1
the	1
Love	1
of	1
God,’	1
in	1
which	1
is	1
condensed	1
all	1
that	1
you	1
or	1
the	1
most	1
imaginative	1
mind	1
can	1
want	1
on	1
the	1
subject.	1
In	1
short,	1
all	1
you	1
have	1
to	1
do	1
is	1
to	1
manage	1
to	1
quote	1
these	1
names,	1
or	1
refer	1
to	1
these	1
stories	1
I	1
have	1
mentioned,	1
and	1
leave	1
it	1
to	1
me	1
to	1
insert	1
the	1
annotations	1
and	1
quotations,	1
and	1
I	1
swear	1
by	1
all	1
that’s	1
good	1
to	1
fill	1
your	1
margins	1
and	1
use	1
up	1
four	1
sheets	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
book.	1
“Now	1
let	1
us	1
come	1
to	1
those	1
references	1
to	1
authors	1
which	1
other	1
books	1
have,	1
and	1
you	1
want	1
for	1
yours.	1
The	1
remedy	1
for	1
this	1
is	1
very	1
simple:	1
You	1
have	1
only	1
to	1
look	1
out	1
for	1
some	1
book	1
that	1
quotes	1
them	1
all,	1
from	1
A	1
to	1
Z	1
as	1
you	1
say	1
yourself,	1
and	1
then	1
insert	1
the	1
very	1
same	1
alphabet	1
in	1
your	1
book,	1
and	1
though	1
the	1
imposition	1
may	1
be	1
plain	1
to	1
see,	1
because	1
you	1
have	1
so	1
little	1
need	1
to	1
borrow	1
from	1
them,	1
that	1
is	1
no	1
matter;	1
there	1
will	1
probably	1
be	1
some	1
simple	1
enough	1
to	1
believe	1
that	1
you	1
have	1
made	1
use	1
of	1
them	1
all	1
in	1
this	1
plain,	1
artless	1
story	1
of	1
yours.	1
At	1
any	1
rate,	1
if	1
it	1
answers	1
no	1
other	1
purpose,	1
this	1
long	1
catalogue	1
of	1
authors	1
will	1
serve	1
to	1
give	1
a	1
surprising	1
look	1
of	1
authority	1
to	1
your	1
book.	1
Besides,	1
no	1
one	1
will	1
trouble	1
himself	1
to	1
verify	1
whether	1
you	1
have	1
followed	1
them	1
or	1
whether	1
you	1
have	1
not,	1
being	1
no	1
way	1
concerned	1
in	1
it;	1
especially	1
as,	1
if	1
I	1
mistake	1
not,	1
this	1
book	1
of	1
yours	1
has	1
no	1
need	1
of	1
any	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
things	1
you	1
say	1
it	1
wants,	1
for	1
it	1
is,	1
from	1
beginning	1
to	1
end,	1
an	1
attack	1
upon	1
the	1
books	1
of	1
chivalry,	1
of	1
which	1
Aristotle	1
never	1
dreamt,	1
nor	1
St.	1
Basil	1
said	1
a	1
word,	1
nor	1
Cicero	1
had	1
any	1
knowledge;	1
nor	1
do	1
the	1
niceties	1
of	1
truth	1
nor	1
the	1
observations	1
of	1
astrology	1
come	1
within	1
the	1
range	1
of	1
its	1
fanciful	1
vagaries;	1
nor	1
have	1
geometrical	1
measurements	1
or	1
refutations	1
of	1
the	1
arguments	1
used	1
in	1
rhetoric	1
anything	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
it;	1
nor	1
does	1
it	1
mean	1
to	1
preach	1
to	1
anybody,	1
mixing	1
up	1
things	1
human	1
and	1
divine,	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
motley	1
in	1
which	1
no	1
Christian	1
understanding	1
should	1
dress	1
itself.	1
It	1
has	1
only	1
to	1
avail	1
itself	1
of	1
truth	1
to	1
nature	1
in	1
its	1
composition,	1
and	1
the	1
more	1
perfect	1
the	1
imitation	1
the	1
better	1
the	1
work	1
will	1
be.	1
And	1
as	1
this	1
piece	1
of	1
yours	1
aims	1
at	1
nothing	1
more	1
than	1
to	1
destroy	1
the	1
authority	1
and	1
influence	1
which	1
books	1
of	1
chivalry	1
have	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
public,	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
need	1
for	1
you	1
to	1
go	1
a-begging	1
for	1
aphorisms	1
from	1
philosophers,	1
precepts	1
from	1
Holy	1
Scripture,	1
fables	1
from	1
poets,	1
speeches	1
from	1
orators,	1
or	1
miracles	1
from	1
saints;	1
but	1
merely	1
to	1
take	1
care	1
that	1
your	1
style	1
and	1
diction	1
run	1
musically,	1
pleasantly,	1
and	1
plainly,	1
with	1
clear,	1
proper,	1
and	1
well-placed	1
words,	1
setting	1
forth	1
your	1
purpose	1
to	1
the	1
best	1
of	1
your	1
power,	1
and	1
putting	1
your	1
ideas	1
intelligibly,	1
without	1
confusion	1
or	1
obscurity.	1
Strive,	1
too,	1
that	1
in	1
reading	1
your	1
story	1
the	1
melancholy	1
may	1
be	1
moved	1
to	1
laughter,	1
and	1
the	1
merry	1
made	1
merrier	1
still;	1
that	1
the	1
simple	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
wearied,	1
that	1
the	1
judicious	1
shall	1
admire	1
the	1
invention,	1
that	1
the	1
grave	1
shall	1
not	1
despise	1
it,	1
nor	1
the	1
wise	1
fail	1
to	1
praise	1
it.	1
Finally,	1
keep	1
your	1
aim	1
fixed	1
on	1
the	1
destruction	1
of	1
that	1
ill-founded	1
edifice	1
of	1
the	1
books	1
of	1
chivalry,	1
hated	1
by	1
some	1
and	1
praised	1
by	1
many	1
more;	1
for	1
if	1
you	1
succeed	1
in	1
this	1
you	1
will	1
have	1
achieved	1
no	1
small	1
success.”	1
In	1
profound	1
silence	1
I	1
listened	1
to	1
what	1
my	1
friend	1
said,	1
and	1
his	1
observations	1
made	1
such	1
an	1
impression	1
on	1
me	1
that,	1
without	1
attempting	1
to	1
question	1
them,	1
I	1
admitted	1
their	1
soundness,	1
and	1
out	1
of	1
them	1
I	1
determined	1
to	1
make	1
this	1
Preface;	1
wherein,	1
gentle	1
reader,	1
thou	1
wilt	1
perceive	1
my	1
friend’s	1
good	1
sense,	1
my	1
good	1
fortune	1
in	1
finding	1
such	1
an	1
adviser	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
time	1
of	1
need,	1
and	1
what	1
thou	1
hast	1
gained	1
in	1
receiving,	1
without	1
addition	1
or	1
alteration,	1
the	1
story	1
of	1
the	1
famous	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
of	1
La	1
Mancha,	1
who	1
is	1
held	1
by	1
all	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
the	1
district	1
of	1
the	1
Campo	1
de	1
Montiel	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
the	1
chastest	1
lover	1
and	1
the	1
bravest	1
knight	1
that	1
has	1
for	1
many	1
years	1
been	1
seen	1
in	1
that	1
neighbourhood.	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
desire	1
to	1
magnify	1
the	1
service	1
I	1
render	1
thee	1
in	1
making	1
thee	1
acquainted	1
with	1
so	1
renowned	1
and	1
honoured	1
a	1
knight,	1
but	1
I	1
do	1
desire	1
thy	1
thanks	1
for	1
the	1
acquaintance	1
thou	1
wilt	1
make	1
with	1
the	1
famous	1
Sancho	1
Panza,	1
his	1
squire,	1
in	1
whom,	1
to	1
my	1
thinking,	1
I	1
have	1
given	1
thee	1
condensed	1
all	1
the	1
squirely	1
drolleries	1
that	1
are	1
scattered	1
through	1
the	1
swarm	1
of	1
the	1
vain	1
books	1
of	1
chivalry.	1
And	1
so—may	1
God	1
give	1
thee	1
health,	1
and	1
not	1
forget	1
me.	1
Vale.	1

e’er	1

Thousands	1

a	1

use	1

doublet	1
of	1
fine	1
cloth	1
and	1
velvet	1
breeches	1
and	1
shoes	1
to	1
match	1
for	1
holidays,	1
while	1
on	1
week-days	1
he	1
made	1
a	1
brave	1
figure	1
in	1
his	1
best	1
homespun.	1
He	1
had	1
in	1
his	1
house	1
a	1
housekeeper	1
past	1
forty,	1
a	1
niece	1
under	1
twenty,	1
and	1
a	1
lad	1
for	1
the	1
field	1
and	1
market-place,	1
who	1
used	1
to	1
saddle	1
the	1
hack	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
handle	1
the	1
bill-hook.	1
The	1
age	1
of	1
this	1
gentleman	1
of	1
ours	1
was	1
bordering	1
on	1
fifty;	1
he	1
was	1
of	1
a	1
hardy	1
habit,	1
spare,	1
gaunt-featured,	1
a	1
very	1
early	1
riser	1
and	1
a	1
great	1
sportsman.	1
They	1
will	1
have	1
it	1
his	1
surname	1
was	1
Quixada	1
or	1
Quesada	1
(for	1
here	1
there	1
is	1
some	1
difference	1
of	1
opinion	1
among	1
the	1
authors	1
who	1
write	1
on	1
the	1
subject),	1
although	1
from	1
reasonable	1
conjectures	1
it	1
seems	1
plain	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
called	1
Quexana.	1
This,	1
however,	1
is	1
of	1
but	1
little	1
importance	1
to	1
our	1
tale;	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
enough	1
not	1
to	1
stray	1
a	1
hair’s	1
breadth	1
from	1
the	1
truth	1
in	1
the	1
telling	1
of	1
it.	1
You	1
must	1
know,	1
then,	1
that	1
the	1
above-named	1
gentleman	1
whenever	1
he	1
was	1
at	1
leisure	1
(which	1
was	1
mostly	1
all	1
the	1
year	1
round)	1
gave	1
himself	1
up	1
to	1
reading	1
books	1
of	1
chivalry	1
with	1
such	1
ardour	1
and	1
avidity	1
that	1
he	1
almost	1
entirely	1
neglected	1
the	1
pursuit	1
of	1
his	1
field-sports,	1
and	1
even	1
the	1
management	1
of	1
his	1
property;	1
and	1
to	1
such	1
a	1
pitch	1
did	1
his	1
eagerness	1
and	1
infatuation	1
go	1
that	1
he	1
sold	1
many	1
an	1
acre	1
of	1
tillageland	1
to	1
buy	1
books	1
of	1
chivalry	1
to	1
read,	1
and	1
brought	1
home	1
as	1
many	1
of	1
them	1
as	1
he	1
could	1
get.	1
But	1
of	1
all	1
there	1
were	1
none	1
he	1
liked	1
so	1
well	1
as	1
those	1
of	1
the	1
famous	1
Feliciano	1
de	1
Silva’s	1
composition,	1
for	1
their	1
lucidity	1
of	1
style	1
and	1
complicated	1
conceits	1
were	1
as	1
pearls	1
in	1
his	1
sight,	1
particularly	1
when	1
in	1
his	1
reading	1
he	1
came	1
upon	1
courtships	1
and	1
cartels,	1
where	1
he	1
often	1
found	1
passages	1
like	1
“_the	1
reason	1
of	1
the	1
unreason	1
with	1
which	1
my	1
reason	1
is	1
afflicted	1
so	1
weakens	1
my	1
reason	1
that	1
with	1
reason	1
I	1
murmur	1
at	1
your	1
beauty;”	1
or	1
again,	1
“the	1
high	1
heavens,	1
that	1
of	1
your	1
divinity	1
divinely	1
fortify	1
you	1
with	1
the	1
stars,	1
render	1
you	1
deserving	1
of	1
the	1
desert	1
your	1
greatness	1
deserves_.”	1
Over	1
conceits	1
of	1
this	1
sort	1
the	1
poor	1
gentleman	1
lost	1
his	1
wits,	1
and	1
used	1
to	1
lie	1
awake	1
striving	1
to	1
understand	1
them	1
and	1
worm	1
the	1
meaning	1
out	1
of	1
them;	1
what	1
Aristotle	1
himself	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
made	1
out	1
or	1
extracted	1
had	1
he	1
come	1
to	1
life	1
again	1
for	1
that	1
special	1
purpose.	1
He	1
was	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
easy	1
about	1
the	1
wounds	1
which	1
Don	1
Belianis	1
gave	1
and	1
took,	1
because	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
that,	1
great	1
as	1
were	1
the	1
surgeons	1
who	1
had	1
cured	1
him,	1
he	1
must	1
have	1
had	1
his	1
face	1
and	1
body	1
covered	1
all	1
over	1
with	1
seams	1
and	1
scars.	1
He	1
commended,	1
however,	1
the	1
author’s	1
way	1
of	1
ending	1
his	1
book	1
with	1
the	1
promise	1
of	1
that	1
interminable	1
adventure,	1
and	1
many	1
a	1
time	1
was	1
he	1
tempted	1
to	1
take	1
up	1
his	1
pen	1
and	1
finish	1
it	1
properly	1
as	1
is	1
there	1
proposed,	1
which	1
no	1
doubt	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
done,	1
and	1
made	1
a	1
successful	1
piece	1
of	1
work	1
of	1
it	1
too,	1
had	1
not	1
greater	1
and	1
more	1
absorbing	1
thoughts	1
prevented	1
him.	1
Many	1
an	1
argument	1
did	1
he	1
have	1
with	1
the	1
curate	1
of	1
his	1
village	1
(a	1
learned	1
man,	1
and	1
a	1
graduate	1
of	1
Siguenza)	1
as	1
to	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
the	1
better	1
knight,	1
Palmerin	1
of	1
England	1
or	1
Amadis	1
of	1
Gaul.	1
Master	1
Nicholas,	1
the	1
village	1
barber,	1
however,	1
used	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
neither	1
of	1
them	1
came	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
Knight	1
of	1
Phœbus,	1
and	1
that	1
if	1
there	1
was	1
any	1
that	1
could	1
compare	1
with	1
_him_	1
it	1
was	1
Don	1
Galaor,	1
the	1
brother	1
of	1
Amadis	1
of	1
Gaul,	1
because	1
he	1
had	1
a	1
spirit	1
that	1
was	1
equal	1
to	1
every	1
occasion,	1
and	1
was	1
no	1
finikin	1
knight,	1
nor	1
lachrymose	1
like	1
his	1
brother,	1
while	1
in	1
the	1
matter	1
of	1
valour	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
whit	1
behind	1
him.	1
In	1
short,	1
he	1
became	1
so	1
absorbed	1
in	1
his	1
books	1
that	1
he	1
spent	1
his	1
nights	1
from	1
sunset	1
to	1
sunrise,	1
and	1
his	1
days	1
from	1
dawn	1
to	1
dark,	1
poring	1
over	1
them;	1
and	1
what	1
with	1
little	1
sleep	1
and	1
much	1
reading	1
his	1
brains	1
got	1
so	1
dry	1
that	1
he	1
lost	1
his	1
wits.	1
His	1
fancy	1
grew	1
full	1
of	1
what	1
he	1
used	1
to	1
read	1
about	1
in	1
his	1
books,	1
enchantments,	1
quarrels,	1
battles,	1
challenges,	1
wounds,	1
wooings,	1
loves,	1
agonies,	1
and	1
all	1
sorts	1
of	1
impossible	1
nonsense;	1
and	1
it	1
so	1
possessed	1
his	1
mind	1
that	1
the	1
whole	1
fabric	1
of	1
invention	1
and	1
fancy	1
he	1
read	1
of	1
was	1
true,	1
that	1
to	1
him	1
no	1
history	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
had	1
more	1
reality	1
in	1
it.	1
He	1
used	1
to	1
say	1
the	1
Cid	1
Ruy	1
Diaz	1
was	1
a	1
very	1
good	1
knight,	1
but	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
compared	1
with	1
the	1
Knight	1
of	1
the	1
Burning	1
Sword	1
who	1
with	1
one	1
back-stroke	1
cut	1
in	1
half	1
two	1
fierce	1
and	1
monstrous	1
giants.	1
He	1
thought	1
more	1
of	1
Bernardo	1
del	1
Carpio	1
because	1
at	1
Roncesvalles	1
he	1
slew	1
Roland	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
enchantments,	1
availing	1
himself	1
of	1
the	1
artifice	1
of	1
Hercules	1
when	1
he	1
strangled	1
Antæus	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Terra	1
in	1
his	1
arms.	1
He	1
approved	1
highly	1
of	1
the	1
giant	1
Morgante,	1
because,	1
although	1
of	1
the	1
giant	1
breed	1
which	1
is	1
always	1
arrogant	1
and	1
ill-conditioned,	1
he	1
alone	1
was	1
affable	1
and	1
well-bred.	1
But	1
above	1
all	1
he	1
admired	1
Reinaldos	1
of	1
Montalban,	1
especially	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
him	1
sallying	1
forth	1
from	1
his	1
castle	1
and	1
robbing	1
everyone	1
he	1
met,	1
and	1
when	1
beyond	1
the	1
seas	1
he	1
stole	1
that	1
image	1
of	1
Mahomet	1
which,	1
as	1
his	1
history	1
says,	1
was	1
entirely	1
of	1
gold.	1
To	1
have	1
a	1
bout	1
of	1
kicking	1
at	1
that	1
traitor	1
of	1
a	1
Ganelon	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
given	1
his	1
housekeeper,	1
and	1
his	1
niece	1
into	1
the	1
bargain.	1
In	1
short,	1
his	1
wits	1
being	1
quite	1
gone,	1
he	1
hit	1
upon	1
the	1
strangest	1
notion	1
that	1
ever	1
madman	1
in	1
this	1
world	1
hit	1
upon,	1
and	1
that	1
was	1
that	1
he	1
fancied	1
it	1
was	1
right	1
and	1
requisite,	1
as	1
well	1
for	1
the	1
support	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
honour	1
as	1
for	1
the	1
service	1
of	1
his	1
country,	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
make	1
a	1
knight-errant	1
of	1
himself,	1
roaming	1
the	1
world	1
over	1
in	1
full	1
armour	1
and	1
on	1
horseback	1
in	1
quest	1
of	1
adventures,	1
and	1
putting	1
in	1
practice	1
himself	1
all	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
read	1
of	1
as	1
being	1
the	1
usual	1
practices	1
of	1
knights-errant;	1
righting	1
every	1
kind	1
of	1
wrong,	1
and	1
exposing	1
himself	1
to	1
peril	1
and	1
danger	1
from	1
which,	1
in	1
the	1
issue,	1
he	1
was	1
to	1
reap	1
eternal	1
renown	1
and	1
fame.	1
Already	1
the	1
poor	1
man	1
saw	1
himself	1
crowned	1
by	1
the	1
might	1
of	1
his	1
arm	1
Emperor	1
of	1
Trebizond	1
at	1
least;	1
and	1
so,	1
led	1
away	1
by	1
the	1
intense	1
enjoyment	1
he	1
found	1
in	1
these	1
pleasant	1
fancies,	1
he	1
set	1
himself	1
forthwith	1
to	1
put	1
his	1
scheme	1
into	1
execution.	1
The	1
first	1
thing	1
he	1
did	1
was	1
to	1
clean	1
up	1
some	1
armour	1
that	1
had	1
belonged	1
to	1
his	1
great-grandfather,	1
and	1
had	1
been	1
for	1
ages	1
lying	1
forgotten	1
in	1
a	1
corner	1
eaten	1
with	1
rust	1
and	1
covered	1
with	1
mildew.	1
He	1
scoured	1
and	1
polished	1
it	1
as	1
best	1
he	1
could,	1
but	1
he	1
perceived	1
one	1
great	1
defect	1
in	1
it,	1
that	1
it	1
had	1
no	1
closed	1
helmet,	1
nothing	1
but	1
a	1
simple	1
morion.	1
This	1
deficiency,	1
however,	1
his	1
ingenuity	1
supplied,	1
for	1
he	1
contrived	1
a	1
kind	1
of	1
half-helmet	1
of	1
pasteboard	1
which,	1
fitted	1
on	1
to	1
the	1
morion,	1
looked	1
like	1
a	1
whole	1
one.	1
It	1
is	1
true	1
that,	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
see	1
if	1
it	1
was	1
strong	1
and	1
fit	1
to	1
stand	1
a	1
cut,	1
he	1
drew	1
his	1
sword	1
and	1
gave	1
it	1
a	1
couple	1
of	1
slashes,	1
the	1
first	1
of	1
which	1
undid	1
in	1
an	1
instant	1
what	1
had	1
taken	1
him	1
a	1
week	1
to	1
do.	1
The	1
ease	1
with	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
knocked	1
it	1
to	1
pieces	1
disconcerted	1
him	1
somewhat,	1
and	1
to	1
guard	1
against	1
that	1
danger	1
he	1
set	1
to	1
work	1
again,	1
fixing	1
bars	1
of	1
iron	1
on	1
the	1
inside	1
until	1
he	1
was	1
satisfied	1
with	1
its	1
strength;	1
and	1
then,	1
not	1
caring	1
to	1
try	1
any	1
more	1
experiments	1
with	1
it,	1
he	1
passed	1
it	1
and	1
adopted	1
it	1
as	1
a	1
helmet	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
perfect	1
construction.	1
He	1
next	1
proceeded	1
to	1
inspect	1
his	1
hack,	1
which,	1
with	1
more	1
quartos	1
than	1
a	1
real	1
and	1
more	1
blemishes	1
than	1
the	1
steed	1
of	1
Gonela,	1
that	1
“_tantum	1
pellis	1
et	1
ossa	1
fuit_,”	1
surpassed	1
in	1
his	1
eyes	1
the	1
Bucephalus	1
of	1
Alexander	1
or	1
the	1
Babieca	1
of	1
the	1
Cid.	1
Four	1
days	1
were	1
spent	1
in	1
thinking	1
what	1
name	1
to	1
give	1
him,	1
because	1
(as	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
himself)	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
right	1
that	1
a	1
horse	1
belonging	1
to	1
a	1
knight	1
so	1
famous,	1
and	1
one	1
with	1
such	1
merits	1
of	1
his	1
own,	1
should	1
be	1
without	1
some	1
distinctive	1
name,	1
and	1
he	1
strove	1
to	1
adapt	1
it	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
indicate	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
before	1
belonging	1
to	1
a	1
knight-errant,	1
and	1
what	1
he	1
then	1
was;	1
for	1
it	1
was	1
only	1
reasonable	1
that,	1
his	1
master	1
taking	1
a	1
new	1
character,	1
he	1
should	1
take	1
a	1
new	1
name,	1
and	1
that	1
it	1
should	1
be	1
a	1
distinguished	1
and	1
full-sounding	1
one,	1
befitting	1
the	1
new	1
order	1
and	1
calling	1
he	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
follow.	1
And	1
so,	1
after	1
having	1
composed,	1
struck	1
out,	1
rejected,	1
added	1
to,	1
unmade,	1
and	1
remade	1
a	1
multitude	1
of	1
names	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
memory	1
and	1
fancy,	1
he	1
decided	1
upon	1
calling	1
him	1
Rocinante,	1
a	1
name,	1
to	1
his	1
thinking,	1
lofty,	1
sonorous,	1
and	1
significant	1
of	1
his	1
condition	1
as	1
a	1
hack	1
before	1
he	1
became	1
what	1
he	1
now	1
was,	1
the	1
first	1
and	1
foremost	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
hacks	1
in	1
the	1
world.	1
Having	1
got	1
a	1
name	1
for	1
his	1
horse	1
so	1
much	1
to	1
his	1
taste,	1
he	1
was	1
anxious	1
to	1
get	1
one	1
for	1
himself,	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
eight	1
days	1
more	1
pondering	1
over	1
this	1
point,	1
till	1
at	1
last	1
he	1
made	1
up	1
his	1
mind	1
to	1
call	1
himself	1
“Don	1
Quixote,”	1
whence,	1
as	1
has	1
been	1
already	1
said,	1
the	1
authors	1
of	1
this	1
veracious	1
history	1
have	1
inferred	1
that	1
his	1
name	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
beyond	1
a	1
doubt	1
Quixada,	1
and	1
not	1
Quesada	1
as	1
others	1
would	1
have	1
it.	1
Recollecting,	1
however,	1
that	1
the	1
valiant	1
Amadis	1
was	1
not	1
content	1
to	1
call	1
himself	1
curtly	1
Amadis	1
and	1
nothing	1
more,	1
but	1
added	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
his	1
kingdom	1
and	1
country	1
to	1
make	1
it	1
famous,	1
and	1
called	1
himself	1
Amadis	1
of	1
Gaul,	1
he,	1
like	1
a	1
good	1
knight,	1
resolved	1
to	1
add	1
on	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
his,	1
and	1
to	1
style	1
himself	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
of	1
La	1
Mancha,	1
whereby,	1
he	1
considered,	1
he	1
described	1
accurately	1
his	1
origin	1
and	1
country,	1
and	1
did	1
honour	1
to	1
it	1
in	1
taking	1
his	1
surname	1
from	1
it.	1
So	1
then,	1
his	1
armour	1
being	1
furbished,	1
his	1
morion	1
turned	1
into	1
a	1
helmet,	1
his	1
hack	1
christened,	1
and	1
he	1
himself	1
confirmed,	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
conclusion	1
that	1
nothing	1
more	1
was	1
needed	1
now	1
but	1
to	1
look	1
out	1
for	1
a	1
lady	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
love	1
with;	1
for	1
a	1
knight-errant	1
without	1
love	1
was	1
like	1
a	1
tree	1
without	1
leaves	1
or	1
fruit,	1
or	1
a	1
body	1
without	1
a	1
soul.	1
As	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
himself,	1
“If,	1
for	1
my	1
sins,	1
or	1
by	1
my	1
good	1
fortune,	1
I	1
come	1
across	1
some	1
giant	1
hereabouts,	1
a	1
common	1
occurrence	1
with	1
knights-errant,	1
and	1
overthrow	1
him	1
in	1
one	1
onslaught,	1
or	1
cleave	1
him	1
asunder	1
to	1
the	1
waist,	1
or,	1
in	1
short,	1
vanquish	1
and	1
subdue	1
him,	1
will	1
it	1
not	1
be	1
well	1
to	1
have	1
someone	1
I	1
may	1
send	1
him	1
to	1
as	1
a	1
present,	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
come	1
in	1
and	1
fall	1
on	1
his	1
knees	1
before	1
my	1
sweet	1
lady,	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
humble,	1
submissive	1
voice	1
say,	1
‘I	1
am	1
the	1
giant	1
Caraculiambro,	1
lord	1
of	1
the	1
island	1
of	1
Malindrania,	1
vanquished	1
in	1
single	1
combat	1
by	1
the	1
never	1
sufficiently	1
extolled	1
knight	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
of	1
La	1
Mancha,	1
who	1
has	1
commanded	1
me	1
to	1
present	1
myself	1
before	1
your	1
Grace,	1
that	1
your	1
Highness	1
dispose	1
of	1
me	1
at	1
your	1
pleasure’?”	1
Oh,	1
how	1
our	1
good	1
gentleman	1
enjoyed	1
the	1
delivery	1
of	1
this	1
speech,	1
especially	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
thought	1
of	1
someone	1
to	1
call	1
his	1
Lady!	1
There	1
was,	1
so	1
the	1
story	1
goes,	1
in	1
a	1
village	1
near	1
his	1
own	1
a	1
very	1
good-looking	1
farm-girl	1
with	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
at	1
one	1
time	1
in	1
love,	1
though,	1
so	1
far	1
as	1
is	1
known,	1
she	1
never	1
knew	1
it	1
nor	1
gave	1
a	1
thought	1
to	1
the	1
matter.	1
Her	1
name	1
was	1
Aldonza	1
Lorenzo,	1
and	1
upon	1
her	1
he	1
thought	1
fit	1
to	1
confer	1
the	1
title	1
of	1
Lady	1
of	1
his	1
Thoughts;	1
and	1
after	1
some	1
search	1
for	1
a	1
name	1
which	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
out	1
of	1
harmony	1
with	1
her	1
own,	1
and	1
should	1
suggest	1
and	1
indicate	1
that	1
of	1
a	1
princess	1
and	1
great	1
lady,	1
he	1
decided	1
upon	1
calling	1
her	1
Dulcinea	1
del	1
Toboso—she	1
being	1
of	1
El	1
Toboso—a	1
name,	1
to	1
his	1
mind,	1
musical,	1
uncommon,	1
and	1
significant,	1
like	1
all	1
those	1
he	1
had	1
already	1
bestowed	1
upon	1
himself	1
and	1
the	1
things	1
belonging	1
to	1
him.	1

These	1
preliminaries	1
settled,	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
care	1
to	1
put	1
off	1
any	1
longer	1
the	1
execution	1
of	1
his	1
design,	1
urged	1
on	1
to	1
it	1
by	1
the	1
thought	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
world	1
was	1
losing	1
by	1
his	1
delay,	1
seeing	1
what	1
wrongs	1
he	1
intended	1
to	1
right,	1
grievances	1
to	1
redress,	1
injustices	1
to	1
repair,	1
abuses	1
to	1
remove,	1
and	1
duties	1
to	1
discharge.	1
So,	1
without	1
giving	1
notice	1
of	1
his	1
intention	1
to	1
anyone,	1
and	1
without	1
anybody	1
seeing	1
him,	1
one	1
morning	1
before	1
the	1
dawning	1
of	1
the	1
day	1
(which	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
hottest	1
of	1
the	1
month	1
of	1
July)	1
he	1
donned	1
his	1
suit	1
of	1
armour,	1
mounted	1
Rocinante	1
with	1
his	1
patched-up	1
helmet	1
on,	1
braced	1
his	1
buckler,	1
took	1
his	1
lance,	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
back	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
yard	1
sallied	1
forth	1
upon	1
the	1
plain	1
in	1
the	1
highest	1
contentment	1
and	1
satisfaction	1
at	1
seeing	1
with	1
what	1
ease	1
he	1
had	1
made	1
a	1
beginning	1
with	1
his	1
grand	1
purpose.	1
But	1
scarcely	1
did	1
he	1
find	1
himself	1
upon	1
the	1
open	1
plain,	1
when	1
a	1
terrible	1
thought	1
struck	1
him,	1
one	1
all	1
but	1
enough	1
to	1
make	1
him	1
abandon	1
the	1
enterprise	1
at	1
the	1
very	1
outset.	1
It	1
occurred	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
dubbed	1
a	1
knight,	1
and	1
that	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
chivalry	1
he	1
neither	1
could	1
nor	1
ought	1
to	1
bear	1
arms	1
against	1
any	1
knight;	1
and	1
that	1
even	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
been,	1
still	1
he	1
ought,	1
as	1
a	1
novice	1
knight,	1
to	1
wear	1
white	1
armour,	1
without	1
a	1
device	1
upon	1
the	1
shield	1
until	1
by	1
his	1
prowess	1
he	1
had	1
earned	1
one.	1
These	1
reflections	1
made	1
him	1
waver	1
in	1
his	1
purpose,	1
but	1
his	1
craze	1
being	1
stronger	1
than	1
any	1
reasoning,	1
he	1
made	1
up	1
his	1
mind	1
to	1
have	1
himself	1
dubbed	1
a	1
knight	1
by	1
the	1
first	1
one	1
he	1
came	1
across,	1
following	1
the	1
example	1
of	1
others	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
case,	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
read	1
in	1
the	1
books	1
that	1
brought	1
him	1
to	1
this	1
pass.	1
As	1
for	1
white	1
armour,	1
he	1
resolved,	1
on	1
the	1
first	1
opportunity,	1
to	1
scour	1
his	1
until	1
it	1
was	1
whiter	1
than	1
an	1
ermine;	1
and	1
so	1
comforting	1
himself	1
he	1
pursued	1
his	1
way,	1
taking	1
that	1
which	1
his	1
horse	1
chose,	1
for	1
in	1
this	1
he	1
believed	1
lay	1
the	1
essence	1
of	1
adventures.	1
Thus	1
setting	1
out,	1
our	1
new-fledged	1
adventurer	1
paced	1
along,	1
talking	1
to	1
himself	1
and	1
saying,	1
“Who	1
knows	1
but	1
that	1
in	1
time	1
to	1
come,	1
when	1
the	1
veracious	1
history	1
of	1
my	1
famous	1
deeds	1
is	1
made	1
known,	1
the	1
sage	1
who	1
writes	1
it,	1
when	1
he	1
has	1
to	1
set	1
forth	1
my	1
first	1
sally	1
in	1
the	1
early	1
morning,	1
will	1
do	1
it	1
after	1
this	1
fashion?	1
‘Scarce	1
had	1
the	1
rubicund	1
Apollo	1
spread	1
o’er	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
broad	1
spacious	1
earth	1
the	1
golden	1
threads	1
of	1
his	1
bright	1
hair,	1
scarce	1
had	1
the	1
little	1
birds	1
of	1
painted	1
plumage	1
attuned	1
their	1
notes	1
to	1
hail	1
with	1
dulcet	1
and	1
mellifluous	1
harmony	1
the	1
coming	1
of	1
the	1
rosy	1
Dawn,	1
that,	1
deserting	1
the	1
soft	1
couch	1
of	1
her	1
jealous	1
spouse,	1
was	1
appearing	1
to	1
mortals	1
at	1
the	1
gates	1
and	1
balconies	1
of	1
the	1
Manchegan	1
horizon,	1
when	1
the	1
renowned	1
knight	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
of	1
La	1
Mancha,	1
quitting	1
the	1
lazy	1
down,	1
mounted	1
his	1
celebrated	1
steed	1
Rocinante	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
traverse	1
the	1
ancient	1
and	1
famous	1
Campo	1
de	1
Montiel;’”	1
which	1
in	1
fact	1
he	1
was	1
actually	1
traversing.	1
“Happy	1
the	1
age,	1
happy	1
the	1
time,”	1
he	1
continued,	1
“in	1
which	1
shall	1
be	1
made	1
known	1
my	1
deeds	1
of	1
fame,	1
worthy	1
to	1
be	1
moulded	1
in	1
brass,	1
carved	1
in	1
marble,	1
limned	1
in	1
pictures,	1
for	1
a	1
memorial	1
for	1
ever.	1
And	1
thou,	1
O	1
sage	1
magician,	1
whoever	1
thou	1
art,	1
to	1
whom	1
it	1
shall	1
fall	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
chronicler	1
of	1
this	1
wondrous	1
history,	1
forget	1
not,	1
I	1
entreat	1
thee,	1
my	1
good	1
Rocinante,	1
the	1
constant	1
companion	1
of	1
my	1
ways	1
and	1
wanderings.”	1
Presently	1
he	1
broke	1
out	1
again,	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
were	1
love-stricken	1
in	1
earnest,	1
“O	1
Princess	1
Dulcinea,	1
lady	1
of	1
this	1
captive	1
heart,	1
a	1
grievous	1
wrong	1
hast	1
thou	1
done	1
me	1
to	1
drive	1
me	1
forth	1
with	1
scorn,	1
and	1
with	1
inexorable	1
obduracy	1
banish	1
me	1
from	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
thy	1
beauty.	1
O	1
lady,	1
deign	1
to	1
hold	1
in	1
remembrance	1
this	1
heart,	1
thy	1
vassal,	1
that	1
thus	1
in	1
anguish	1
pines	1
for	1
love	1
of	1
thee.”	1
So	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
stringing	1
together	1
these	1
and	1
other	1
absurdities,	1
all	1
in	1
the	1
style	1
of	1
those	1
his	1
books	1
had	1
taught	1
him,	1
imitating	1
their	1
language	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
he	1
could;	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
while	1
he	1
rode	1
so	1
slowly	1
and	1
the	1
sun	1
mounted	1
so	1
rapidly	1
and	1
with	1
such	1
fervour	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
enough	1
to	1
melt	1
his	1
brains	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
any.	1
Nearly	1
all	1
day	1
he	1
travelled	1
without	1
anything	1
remarkable	1
happening	1
to	1
him,	1
at	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
despair,	1
for	1
he	1
was	1
anxious	1
to	1
encounter	1
someone	1
at	1
once	1
upon	1
whom	1
to	1
try	1
the	1
might	1
of	1
his	1
strong	1
arm.	1

Writers	1
there	1
are	1
who	1
say	1
the	1
first	1
adventure	1
he	1
met	1
with	1
was	1
that	1
of	1
Puerto	1
Lapice;	1
others	1
say	1
it	1
was	1
that	1
of	1
the	1

what	1
I	1

on	1

and	1
what	1
I	1
have	1
found	1
written	1
in	1
the	1
annals	1
of	1
La	1
Mancha,	1
is	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
on	1
the	1
road	1
all	1
day,	1
and	1
towards	1
nightfall	1
his	1
hack	1
and	1
he	1
found	1
themselves	1
dead	1
tired	1
and	1
hungry,	1
when,	1
looking	1
all	1
around	1
to	1
see	1
if	1
he	1
could	1
discover	1
any	1
castle	1
or	1
shepherd’s	1
shanty	1
where	1
he	1
might	1
refresh	1
himself	1
and	1
relieve	1
his	1
sore	1
wants,	1
he	1
perceived	1
not	1
far	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
road	1
an	1
inn,	1
which	1
was	1
as	1
welcome	1
as	1
a	1
star	1
guiding	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
portals,	1
if	1
not	1
the	1
palaces,	1
of	1
his	1
redemption;	1
and	1
quickening	1
his	1
pace	1
he	1
reached	1
it	1
just	1
as	1
night	1
was	1
setting	1
in.	1
At	1
the	1
door	1
were	1
standing	1
two	1
young	1
women,	1
girls	1
of	1
the	1
district	1
as	1
they	1
call	1
them,	1
on	1
their	1
way	1
to	1
Seville	1
with	1
some	1
carriers	1
who	1
had	1
chanced	1
to	1
halt	1
that	1
night	1
at	1
the	1
inn;	1
and	1
as,	1
happen	1
what	1
might	1
to	1
our	1
adventurer,	1
everything	1
he	1
saw	1
or	1
imagined	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
and	1
to	1
happen	1
after	1
the	1
fashion	1
of	1
what	1
he	1
read	1
of,	1
the	1
moment	1
he	1
saw	1
the	1
inn	1
he	1
pictured	1
it	1
to	1
himself	1
as	1
a	1
castle	1
with	1
its	1
four	1
turrets	1
and	1
pinnacles	1
of	1
shining	1
silver,	1
not	1
forgetting	1
the	1
drawbridge	1
and	1
moat	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
belongings	1
usually	1
ascribed	1
to	1
castles	1
of	1
the	1
sort.	1
To	1
this	1
inn,	1
which	1
to	1
him	1
seemed	1
a	1
castle,	1
he	1
advanced,	1
and	1
at	1
a	1
short	1
distance	1
from	1
it	1
he	1
checked	1
Rocinante,	1
hoping	1
that	1
some	1
dwarf	1
would	1
show	1
himself	1
upon	1
the	1
battlements,	1
and	1
by	1
sound	1
of	1
trumpet	1
give	1
notice	1
that	1
a	1
knight	1
was	1
approaching	1
the	1
castle.	1
But	1
seeing	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
slow	1
about	1
it,	1
and	1
that	1
Rocinante	1
was	1
in	1
a	1
hurry	1
to	1
reach	1
the	1
stable,	1
he	1
made	1
for	1
the	1
inn	1
door,	1
and	1
perceived	1
the	1
two	1
gay	1
damsels	1
who	1
were	1
standing	1
there,	1
and	1
who	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
two	1
fair	1
maidens	1
or	1
lovely	1
ladies	1
taking	1
their	1
ease	1
at	1
the	1
castle	1
gate.	1
At	1
this	1
moment	1
it	1
so	1
happened	1
that	1
a	1
swineherd	1
who	1
was	1
going	1
through	1
the	1
stubbles	1
collecting	1
a	1
drove	1
of	1
pigs	1
(for,	1
without	1
any	1
apology,	1
that	1
is	1
what	1
they	1
are	1
called)	1
gave	1
a	1
blast	1
of	1
his	1
horn	1
to	1
bring	1
them	1
together,	1
and	1
forthwith	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
to	1
be	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
expecting,	1
the	1
signal	1
of	1
some	1
dwarf	1
announcing	1
his	1
arrival;	1
and	1
so	1
with	1
prodigious	1
satisfaction	1
he	1
rode	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
inn	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
ladies,	1
who,	1
seeing	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
this	1
sort	1
approaching	1
in	1
full	1
armour	1
and	1
with	1
lance	1
and	1
buckler,	1
were	1
turning	1
in	1
dismay	1
into	1
the	1
inn,	1
when	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
guessing	1
their	1
fear	1
by	1
their	1
flight,	1
raising	1
his	1
pasteboard	1
visor,	1
disclosed	1
his	1
dry	1
dusty	1
visage,	1
and	1
with	1
courteous	1
bearing	1
and	1
gentle	1
voice	1
addressed	1
them,	1
“Your	1
ladyships	1
need	1
not	1
fly	1
or	1
fear	1
any	1
rudeness,	1
for	1
that	1
it	1
belongs	1
not	1
to	1
the	1
order	1
of	1
knighthood	1
which	1
I	1
profess	1
to	1
offer	1
to	1
anyone,	1
much	1
less	1
to	1
highborn	1
maidens	1
as	1
your	1
appearance	1
proclaims	1
you	1
to	1
be.”	1
The	1
girls	1
were	1
looking	1
at	1
him	1
and	1
straining	1
their	1
eyes	1
to	1
make	1
out	1
the	1
features	1
which	1
the	1
clumsy	1
visor	1
obscured,	1
but	1
when	1
they	1
heard	1
themselves	1
called	1
maidens,	1
a	1
thing	1
so	1
much	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
line,	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
restrain	1
their	1
laughter,	1
which	1
made	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
wax	1
indignant,	1
and	1
say,	1
“Modesty	1
becomes	1
the	1
fair,	1
and	1
moreover	1
laughter	1
that	1
has	1
little	1
cause	1
is	1
great	1
silliness;	1
this,	1
however,	1
I	1
say	1
not	1
to	1
pain	1
or	1
anger	1
you,	1
for	1
my	1
desire	1
is	1
none	1
other	1
than	1
to	1
serve	1
you.”	1
The	1
incomprehensible	1
language	1
and	1
the	1
unpromising	1
looks	1
of	1
our	1
cavalier	1
only	1
increased	1
the	1
ladies’	1
laughter,	1
and	1
that	1
increased	1
his	1
irritation,	1
and	1
matters	1
might	1
have	1
gone	1
farther	1
if	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
the	1
landlord	1
had	1
not	1
come	1
out,	1
who,	1
being	1
a	1
very	1
fat	1
man,	1
was	1
a	1
very	1
peaceful	1
one.	1
He,	1
seeing	1
this	1
grotesque	1
figure	1
clad	1
in	1
armour	1
that	1
did	1
not	1
match	1
any	1
more	1
than	1
his	1
saddle,	1
bridle,	1
lance,	1
buckler,	1
or	1
corselet,	1
was	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
indisposed	1
to	1
join	1
the	1
damsels	1
in	1
their	1
manifestations	1
of	1
amusement;	1
but,	1
in	1
truth,	1
standing	1
in	1
awe	1
of	1
such	1
a	1
complicated	1
armament,	1
he	1
thought	1
it	1
best	1
to	1
speak	1
him	1
fairly,	1
so	1
he	1
said,	1
“Señor	1
Caballero,	1
if	1
your	1
worship	1
wants	1
lodging,	1
bating	1
the	1
bed	1
(for	1
there	1
is	1
not	1
one	1
in	1
the	1
inn)	1
there	1
is	1
plenty	1
of	1
everything	1
else	1
here.”	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
observing	1
the	1
respectful	1
bearing	1
of	1
the	1
Alcaide	1
of	1
the	1
fortress	1
(for	1
so	1
innkeeper	1
and	1
inn	1
seemed	1
in	1
his	1
eyes),	1
made	1
answer,	1
“Sir	1
Castellan,	1
for	1
me	1
anything	1
will	1
suffice,	1
for	1
‘My	1
armour	1
is	1
my	1
only	1
wear,	1
My	1
only	1
rest	1
the	1
fray.’”	1
The	1
host	1
fancied	1
he	1
called	1
him	1
Castellan	1
because	1
he	1
took	1
him	1
for	1
a	1
“worthy	1
of	1
Castile,”	1
though	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
fact	1
an	1
Andalusian,	1
and	1
one	1
from	1
the	1
strand	1
of	1
San	1
Lucar,	1
as	1
crafty	1
a	1
thief	1
as	1
Cacus	1
and	1
as	1
full	1
of	1
tricks	1
as	1
a	1
student	1
or	1
a	1
page.	1
“In	1
that	1
case,”	1
said	1
he,	1
“‘Your	1
bed	1
is	1
on	1
the	1
flinty	1
rock,	1
Your	1
sleep	1
to	1
watch	1
alway;’	1
and	1
if	1
so,	1
you	1
may	1
dismount	1
and	1
safely	1
reckon	1
upon	1
any	1
quantity	1
of	1
sleeplessness	1
under	1
this	1
roof	1
for	1
a	1
twelvemonth,	1
not	1
to	1
say	1
for	1
a	1
single	1
night.”	1
So	1
saying,	1
he	1
advanced	1
to	1
hold	1
the	1
stirrup	1
for	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
who	1
got	1
down	1
with	1
great	1
difficulty	1
and	1
exertion	1
(for	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
broken	1
his	1
fast	1
all	1
day),	1
and	1
then	1
charged	1
the	1
host	1
to	1
take	1
great	1
care	1
of	1
his	1
horse,	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
the	1
best	1
bit	1
of	1
flesh	1
that	1
ever	1
ate	1
bread	1
in	1
this	1
world.	1
The	1
landlord	1
eyed	1
him	1
over	1
but	1
did	1
not	1
find	1
him	1
as	1
good	1
as	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
said,	1
nor	1
even	1
half	1
as	1
good;	1
and	1
putting	1
him	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
stable,	1
he	1
returned	1
to	1
see	1
what	1
might	1
be	1
wanted	1
by	1
his	1
guest,	1
whom	1
the	1
damsels,	1
who	1
had	1
by	1
this	1
time	1
made	1
their	1
peace	1
with	1
him,	1
were	1
now	1
relieving	1
of	1
his	1
armour.	1
They	1
had	1
taken	1
off	1
his	1
breastplate	1
and	1
backpiece,	1
but	1
they	1
neither	1
knew	1
nor	1
saw	1
how	1
to	1
open	1
his	1
gorget	1
or	1
remove	1
his	1
make-shift	1
helmet,	1
for	1
he	1
had	1
fastened	1
it	1
with	1
green	1
ribbons,	1
which,	1
as	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
untying	1
the	1
knots,	1
required	1
to	1
be	1
cut.	1
This,	1
however,	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
by	1
any	1
means	1
consent	1
to,	1
so	1
he	1
remained	1
all	1
the	1
evening	1
with	1
his	1
helmet	1
on,	1
the	1
drollest	1
and	1
oddest	1
figure	1
that	1
can	1
be	1
imagined;	1
and	1
while	1
they	1
were	1
removing	1
his	1
armour,	1
taking	1
the	1
baggages	1
who	1
were	1
about	1
it	1
for	1
ladies	1
of	1
high	1
degree	1
belonging	1
to	1
the	1
castle,	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
them	1
with	1
great	1
sprightliness:	1
“Oh,	1
never,	1
surely,	1
was	1
there	1
knight	1
So	1
served	1
by	1
hand	1
of	1
dame,	1
As	1
served	1
was	1
he,	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
hight,	1
When	1
from	1
his	1
town	1
he	1
came;	1
With	1
maidens	1
waiting	1
on	1
himself,	1
Princesses	1
on	1
his	1
hack—	1
—or	1
Rocinante,	1
for	1
that,	1
ladies	1
mine,	1
is	1
my	1
horse’s	1
name,	1
and	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
of	1
La	1
Mancha	1
is	1
my	1
own;	1
for	1
though	1
I	1
had	1
no	1
intention	1
of	1
declaring	1
myself	1
until	1
my	1
achievements	1
in	1
your	1
service	1
and	1
honour	1
had	1
made	1
me	1
known,	1
the	1
necessity	1
of	1
adapting	1
that	1
old	1
ballad	1
of	1
Lancelot	1
to	1
the	1
present	1
occasion	1
has	1
given	1
you	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
my	1
name	1
altogether	1
prematurely.	1
A	1
time,	1
however,	1
will	1
come	1
for	1
your	1
ladyships	1
to	1
command	1
and	1
me	1
to	1
obey,	1
and	1
then	1
the	1
might	1
of	1
my	1
arm	1
will	1
show	1
my	1
desire	1
to	1
serve	1
you.”	1
The	1
girls,	1
who	1
were	1
not	1
used	1
to	1
hearing	1
rhetoric	1
of	1
this	1
sort,	1
had	1
nothing	1
to	1
say	1
in	1
reply;	1
they	1
only	1
asked	1
him	1
if	1
he	1
wanted	1
anything	1
to	1
eat.	1
“I	1
would	1
gladly	1
eat	1
a	1
bit	1
of	1
something,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“for	1
I	1
feel	1
it	1
would	1
come	1
very	1
seasonably.”	1
The	1
day	1
happened	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
Friday,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
whole	1
inn	1
there	1
was	1
nothing	1
but	1
some	1
pieces	1
of	1
the	1
fish	1
they	1
call	1
in	1
Castile	1
“abadejo,”	1
in	1
Andalusia	1
“bacallao,”	1
and	1
in	1
some	1
places	1
“curadillo,”	1
and	1
in	1
others	1
“troutlet;”	1
so	1
they	1
asked	1
him	1
if	1
he	1
thought	1
he	1
could	1
eat	1
troutlet,	1
for	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
other	1
fish	1
to	1
give	1
him.	1
“If	1
there	1
be	1
troutlets	1
enough,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“they	1
will	1
be	1
the	1
same	1
thing	1
as	1
a	1
trout;	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
all	1
one	1
to	1
me	1
whether	1
I	1
am	1
given	1
eight	1
reals	1
in	1
small	1
change	1
or	1
a	1
piece	1
of	1
eight;	1
moreover,	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
that	1
these	1
troutlets	1
are	1
like	1
veal,	1
which	1
is	1
better	1
than	1
beef,	1
or	1
kid,	1
which	1
is	1
better	1
than	1
goat.	1
But	1
whatever	1
it	1
be	1
let	1
it	1
come	1
quickly,	1
for	1
the	1
burden	1
and	1
pressure	1
of	1
arms	1
cannot	1
be	1
borne	1
without	1
support	1
to	1
the	1
inside.”	1
They	1
laid	1
a	1
table	1
for	1
him	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
inn	1
for	1
the	1
sake	1
of	1
the	1
air,	1
and	1
the	1
host	1
brought	1
him	1
a	1
portion	1
of	1
ill-soaked	1
and	1
worse	1
cooked	1
stockfish,	1
and	1
a	1
piece	1
of	1
bread	1
as	1
black	1
and	1
mouldy	1
as	1
his	1
own	1
armour;	1
but	1
a	1
laughable	1
sight	1
it	1
was	1
to	1
see	1
him	1
eating,	1
for	1
having	1
his	1
helmet	1
on	1
and	1
the	1
beaver	1
up,	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
with	1
his	1
own	1
hands	1
put	1
anything	1
into	1
his	1
mouth	1
unless	1
someone	1
else	1
placed	1
it	1
there,	1
and	1
this	1
service	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
ladies	1
rendered	1
him.	1
But	1
to	1
give	1
him	1
anything	1
to	1
drink	1
was	1
impossible,	1
or	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
so	1
had	1
not	1
the	1
landlord	1
bored	1
a	1
reed,	1
and	1
putting	1
one	1
end	1
in	1
his	1
mouth	1
poured	1
the	1
wine	1
into	1
him	1
through	1
the	1
other;	1
all	1
which	1
he	1
bore	1
with	1
patience	1
rather	1
than	1
sever	1
the	1
ribbons	1
of	1
his	1
helmet.	1
While	1
this	1
was	1
going	1
on	1
there	1
came	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
inn	1
a	1
sowgelder,	1
who,	1
as	1
he	1
approached,	1
sounded	1
his	1
reed	1
pipe	1
four	1
or	1
five	1
times,	1
and	1
thereby	1
completely	1
convinced	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
some	1
famous	1
castle,	1
and	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
regaling	1
him	1
with	1
music,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
stockfish	1
was	1
trout,	1
the	1
bread	1
the	1
whitest,	1
the	1
wenches	1
ladies,	1
and	1
the	1
landlord	1
the	1
castellan	1
of	1
the	1
castle;	1
and	1
consequently	1
he	1
held	1
that	1
his	1
enterprise	1
and	1
sally	1
had	1
been	1
to	1
some	1
purpose.	1
But	1
still	1
it	1
distressed	1
him	1
to	1
think	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
dubbed	1
a	1
knight,	1
for	1
it	1
was	1
plain	1
to	1
him	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
lawfully	1
engage	1
in	1
any	1
adventure	1
without	1
receiving	1
the	1
order	1
of	1
knighthood.	1

HAD	1
HIMSELF	1
DUBBED	1
A	1
KNIGHT	1
p009.jpg	1
(164K)	1
Full	1
Size	1
Harassed	1
by	1
this	1
reflection,	1
he	1
made	1
haste	1
with	1
his	1
scanty	1
pothouse	1
supper,	1
and	1
having	1
finished	1
it	1
called	1
the	1
landlord,	1
and	1
shutting	1
himself	1
into	1
the	1
stable	1
with	1
him,	1
fell	1
on	1
his	1
knees	1
before	1
him,	1
saying,	1
“From	1
this	1
spot	1
I	1
rise	1
not,	1
valiant	1
knight,	1
until	1
your	1
courtesy	1
grants	1
me	1
the	1
boon	1
I	1
seek,	1
one	1
that	1
will	1
redound	1
to	1
your	1
praise	1
and	1
the	1
benefit	1
of	1
the	1
human	1
race.”	1
The	1
landlord,	1
seeing	1
his	1
guest	1
at	1
his	1
feet	1
and	1
hearing	1
a	1
speech	1
of	1
this	1
kind,	1
stood	1
staring	1
at	1
him	1
in	1
bewilderment,	1
not	1
knowing	1
what	1
to	1
do	1
or	1
say,	1
and	1
entreating	1
him	1
to	1
rise,	1
but	1
all	1
to	1
no	1
purpose	1
until	1
he	1
had	1
agreed	1
to	1
grant	1
the	1
boon	1
demanded	1
of	1
him.	1
“I	1
looked	1
for	1
no	1
less,	1
my	1
lord,	1
from	1
your	1
High	1
Magnificence,”	1
replied	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“and	1
I	1
have	1
to	1
tell	1
you	1
that	1
the	1
boon	1
I	1
have	1
asked	1
and	1
your	1
liberality	1
has	1
granted	1
is	1
that	1
you	1
shall	1
dub	1
me	1
knight	1
to-morrow	1
morning,	1
and	1
that	1
to-night	1
I	1
shall	1
watch	1
my	1
arms	1
in	1
the	1
chapel	1
of	1
this	1
your	1
castle;	1
thus	1
to-morrow,	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
said,	1
will	1
be	1
accomplished	1
what	1
I	1
so	1
much	1
desire,	1
enabling	1
me	1
lawfully	1
to	1
roam	1
through	1
all	1
the	1
four	1
quarters	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
seeking	1
adventures	1
on	1
behalf	1
of	1
those	1
in	1
distress,	1
as	1
is	1
the	1
duty	1
of	1
chivalry	1
and	1
of	1
knights-errant	1
like	1
myself,	1
whose	1
ambition	1
is	1
directed	1
to	1
such	1
deeds.”	1
The	1
landlord,	1
who,	1
as	1
has	1
been	1
mentioned,	1
was	1
something	1
of	1
a	1
wag,	1
and	1
had	1
already	1
some	1
suspicion	1
of	1
his	1
guest’s	1
want	1
of	1
wits,	1
was	1
quite	1
convinced	1
of	1
it	1
on	1
hearing	1
talk	1
of	1
this	1
kind	1
from	1
him,	1
and	1
to	1
make	1
sport	1
for	1
the	1
night	1
he	1
determined	1
to	1
fall	1
in	1
with	1
his	1
humour.	1
So	1
he	1
told	1
him	1
he	1
was	1
quite	1
right	1
in	1
pursuing	1
the	1
object	1
he	1
had	1
in	1
view,	1
and	1
that	1
such	1
a	1
motive	1
was	1
natural	1
and	1
becoming	1
in	1
cavaliers	1
as	1
distinguished	1
as	1
he	1
seemed	1
and	1
his	1
gallant	1
bearing	1
showed	1
him	1
to	1
be;	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
himself	1
in	1
his	1
younger	1
days	1
had	1
followed	1
the	1
same	1
honourable	1
calling,	1
roaming	1
in	1
quest	1
of	1
adventures	1
in	1
various	1
parts	1
of	1
the	1
world,	1
among	1
others	1
the	1
Curing-grounds	1
of	1
Malaga,	1
the	1
Isles	1
of	1
Riaran,	1
the	1
Precinct	1
of	1
Seville,	1
the	1
Little	1
Market	1
of	1

Olivera	1
of	1

quarters,	1
where	1
he	1
had	1
proved	1
the	1
nimbleness	1
of	1
his	1
feet	1
and	1
the	1
lightness	1
of	1
his	1
fingers,	1
doing	1
many	1
wrongs,	1
cheating	1
many	1
widows,	1
ruining	1
maids	1
and	1
swindling	1
minors,	1
and,	1
in	1
short,	1
bringing	1
himself	1
under	1
the	1
notice	1
of	1
almost	1
every	1
tribunal	1
and	1
court	1
of	1
justice	1
in	1
Spain;	1
until	1
at	1
last	1
he	1
had	1
retired	1
to	1
this	1
castle	1
of	1
his,	1
where	1
he	1
was	1
living	1
upon	1
his	1
property	1
and	1
upon	1
that	1
of	1
others;	1
and	1
where	1
he	1
received	1
all	1
knights-errant	1
of	1
whatever	1
rank	1
or	1
condition	1
they	1
might	1
be,	1
all	1
for	1
the	1
great	1
love	1
he	1
bore	1
them	1
and	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
share	1
their	1
substance	1
with	1
him	1
in	1
return	1
for	1
his	1
benevolence.	1
He	1
told	1
him,	1
moreover,	1
that	1
in	1
this	1
castle	1
of	1
his	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
chapel	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
could	1
watch	1
his	1
armour,	1
as	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
pulled	1
down	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
be	1
rebuilt,	1
but	1
that	1
in	1
a	1
case	1
of	1
necessity	1
it	1
might,	1
he	1
knew,	1
be	1
watched	1
anywhere,	1
and	1
he	1
might	1
watch	1
it	1
that	1
night	1
in	1
a	1
courtyard	1
of	1
the	1
castle,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
morning,	1
God	1
willing,	1
the	1
requisite	1
ceremonies	1
might	1
be	1
performed	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
have	1
him	1
dubbed	1
a	1
knight,	1
and	1
so	1
thoroughly	1
dubbed	1
that	1
nobody	1
could	1
be	1
more	1
so.	1
He	1
asked	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
any	1
money	1
with	1
him,	1
to	1
which	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
replied	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
a	1
farthing,	1
as	1
in	1
the	1
histories	1
of	1
knights-errant	1
he	1
had	1
never	1
read	1
of	1
any	1
of	1
them	1
carrying	1
any.	1
On	1
this	1
point	1
the	1
landlord	1
told	1
him	1
he	1
was	1
mistaken;	1
for,	1
though	1
not	1
recorded	1
in	1
the	1
histories,	1
because	1
in	1
the	1
author’s	1
opinion	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
need	1
to	1
mention	1
anything	1
so	1
obvious	1
and	1
necessary	1
as	1
money	1
and	1
clean	1
shirts,	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
supposed	1
therefore	1
that	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
carry	1
them,	1
and	1
he	1
might	1
regard	1
it	1
as	1
certain	1
and	1
established	1
that	1
all	1
knights-errant	1
(about	1
whom	1
there	1
were	1
so	1
many	1
full	1
and	1
unimpeachable	1
books)	1
carried	1
well-furnished	1
purses	1
in	1
case	1
of	1
emergency,	1
and	1
likewise	1
carried	1
shirts	1
and	1
a	1
little	1
box	1
of	1
ointment	1
to	1
cure	1
the	1
wounds	1
they	1
received.	1
For	1
in	1
those	1
plains	1
and	1
deserts	1
where	1
they	1
engaged	1
in	1
combat	1
and	1
came	1
out	1
wounded,	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
always	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
someone	1
to	1
cure	1
them,	1
unless	1
indeed	1
they	1
had	1
for	1
a	1
friend	1
some	1
sage	1
magician	1
to	1
succour	1
them	1
at	1
once	1
by	1
fetching	1
through	1
the	1
air	1
upon	1
a	1
cloud	1
some	1
damsel	1
or	1
dwarf	1
with	1
a	1
vial	1
of	1
water	1
of	1
such	1
virtue	1
that	1
by	1
tasting	1
one	1
drop	1
of	1
it	1
they	1
were	1
cured	1
of	1
their	1
hurts	1
and	1
wounds	1
in	1
an	1
instant	1
and	1
left	1
as	1
sound	1
as	1
if	1
they	1
had	1
not	1
received	1
any	1
damage	1
whatever.	1
But	1
in	1
case	1
this	1
should	1
not	1
occur,	1
the	1
knights	1
of	1
old	1
took	1
care	1
to	1
see	1
that	1
their	1
squires	1
were	1
provided	1
with	1
money	1
and	1
other	1
requisites,	1
such	1
as	1
lint	1
and	1
ointments	1
for	1
healing	1
purposes;	1
and	1
when	1
it	1
happened	1
that	1
knights	1
had	1
no	1
squires	1
(which	1
was	1
rarely	1
and	1
seldom	1
the	1
case)	1
they	1
themselves	1
carried	1
everything	1
in	1
cunning	1
saddle-bags	1
that	1
were	1
hardly	1
seen	1
on	1
the	1
horse’s	1
croup,	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
something	1
else	1
of	1
more	1
importance,	1
because,	1
unless	1
for	1
some	1
such	1
reason,	1
carrying	1
saddle-bags	1
was	1
not	1
very	1
favourably	1
regarded	1
among	1
knights-errant.	1
He	1
therefore	1
advised	1
him	1
(and,	1
as	1
his	1
godson	1
so	1
soon	1
to	1
be,	1
he	1
might	1
even	1
command	1
him)	1
never	1
from	1
that	1
time	1
forth	1
to	1
travel	1
without	1
money	1
and	1
the	1
usual	1
requirements,	1
and	1
he	1
would	1
find	1
the	1
advantage	1
of	1
them	1
when	1
he	1
least	1
expected	1
it.	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
promised	1
to	1
follow	1
his	1
advice	1
scrupulously,	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
arranged	1
forthwith	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
watch	1
his	1
armour	1
in	1
a	1
large	1
yard	1
at	1
one	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
inn;	1
so,	1
collecting	1
it	1
all	1
together,	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
placed	1
it	1
on	1
a	1
trough	1
that	1
stood	1
by	1
the	1
side	1
of	1
a	1
well,	1
and	1
bracing	1
his	1
buckler	1
on	1
his	1
arm	1
he	1
grasped	1
his	1
lance	1
and	1
began	1
with	1
a	1
stately	1
air	1
to	1
march	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
the	1
trough,	1
and	1
as	1
he	1
began	1
his	1
march	1
night	1
began	1
to	1
fall.	1
The	1
landlord	1
told	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
who	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
inn	1
about	1
the	1
craze	1
of	1
his	1
guest,	1
the	1
watching	1
of	1
the	1
armour,	1
and	1
the	1
dubbing	1
ceremony	1
he	1
contemplated.	1
Full	1
of	1
wonder	1
at	1
so	1
strange	1
a	1
form	1
of	1
madness,	1
they	1
flocked	1
to	1
see	1
it	1
from	1
a	1
distance,	1
and	1
observed	1
with	1
what	1
composure	1
he	1
sometimes	1
paced	1
up	1
and	1
down,	1
or	1
sometimes,	1
leaning	1
on	1
his	1
lance,	1
gazed	1
on	1
his	1
armour	1
without	1
taking	1
his	1
eyes	1
off	1
it	1
for	1
ever	1
so	1
long;	1
and	1
as	1
the	1
night	1
closed	1
in	1
with	1
a	1
light	1
from	1
the	1
moon	1
so	1
brilliant	1
that	1
it	1
might	1
vie	1
with	1
his	1
that	1
lent	1
it,	1
everything	1
the	1
novice	1
knight	1
did	1
was	1
plainly	1
seen	1
by	1
all.	1
Meanwhile	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
carriers	1
who	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
inn	1
thought	1
fit	1
to	1
water	1
his	1
team,	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
necessary	1
to	1
remove	1
Don	1
Quixote’s	1
armour	1
as	1
it	1
lay	1
on	1
the	1
trough;	1
but	1
he	1
seeing	1
the	1
other	1
approach	1
hailed	1
him	1
in	1
a	1
loud	1
voice,	1
“O	1
thou,	1
whoever	1
thou	1
art,	1
rash	1
knight	1
that	1
comest	1
to	1
lay	1
hands	1
on	1
the	1
armour	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
valorous	1
errant	1
that	1
ever	1
girt	1
on	1
sword,	1
have	1
a	1
care	1
what	1
thou	1
dost;	1
touch	1
it	1
not	1
unless	1
thou	1
wouldst	1
lay	1
down	1
thy	1
life	1
as	1
the	1
penalty	1
of	1
thy	1
rashness.”	1
The	1
carrier	1
gave	1
no	1
heed	1
to	1
these	1
words	1
(and	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
done	1
better	1
to	1
heed	1
them	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
heedful	1
of	1
his	1
health),	1
but	1
seizing	1
it	1
by	1
the	1
straps	1
flung	1
the	1
armour	1
some	1
distance	1
from	1
him.	1
Seeing	1
this,	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
raised	1
his	1
eyes	1
to	1
heaven,	1
and	1
fixing	1
his	1
thoughts,	1
apparently,	1
upon	1
his	1
lady	1
Dulcinea,	1
exclaimed,	1
“Aid	1
me,	1
lady	1
mine,	1
in	1
this	1
the	1
first	1
encounter	1
that	1
presents	1
itself	1
to	1
this	1
breast	1
which	1
thou	1
holdest	1
in	1
subjection;	1
let	1
not	1
thy	1
favour	1
and	1
protection	1
fail	1
me	1
in	1
this	1
first	1
jeopardy;”	1
and,	1
with	1
these	1
words	1
and	1
others	1
to	1
the	1
same	1
purpose,	1
dropping	1
his	1
buckler	1
he	1
lifted	1
his	1
lance	1
with	1
both	1
hands	1
and	1
with	1
it	1
smote	1
such	1
a	1
blow	1
on	1
the	1
carrier’s	1
head	1
that	1
he	1
stretched	1
him	1
on	1
the	1
ground,	1
so	1
stunned	1
that	1
had	1
he	1
followed	1
it	1
up	1
with	1
a	1
second	1
there	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
no	1
need	1
of	1
a	1
surgeon	1
to	1
cure	1
him.	1
This	1
done,	1
he	1
picked	1
up	1
his	1
armour	1
and	1
returned	1
to	1
his	1
beat	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
serenity	1
as	1
before.	1

Shortly	1
after	1
this,	1
another,	1
not	1
knowing	1
what	1
had	1
happened	1
(for	1
the	1
carrier	1
still	1
lay	1
senseless),	1
came	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
object	1
of	1
giving	1
water	1
to	1
his	1
mules,	1
and	1
was	1
proceeding	1
to	1
remove	1
the	1
armour	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
clear	1
the	1
trough,	1
when	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
without	1
uttering	1
a	1
word	1
or	1
imploring	1
aid	1
from	1
anyone,	1
once	1
more	1
dropped	1
his	1
buckler	1
and	1
once	1
more	1
lifted	1
his	1
lance,	1
and	1
without	1
actually	1
breaking	1
the	1
second	1
carrier’s	1
head	1
into	1
pieces,	1
made	1
more	1
than	1
three	1
of	1
it,	1
for	1
he	1
laid	1
it	1
open	1
in	1
four.	1
At	1
the	1
noise	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
inn	1
ran	1
to	1
the	1
spot,	1
and	1
among	1
them	1
the	1
landlord.	1
Seeing	1
this,	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
braced	1
his	1
buckler	1
on	1
his	1
arm,	1
and	1
with	1
his	1
hand	1
on	1
his	1
sword	1
exclaimed,	1
“O	1
Lady	1
of	1
Beauty,	1
strength	1
and	1
support	1
of	1
my	1
faint	1
heart,	1
it	1
is	1
time	1
for	1
thee	1
to	1
turn	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
thy	1
greatness	1
on	1
this	1
thy	1
captive	1
knight	1
on	1
the	1
brink	1
of	1
so	1
mighty	1
an	1
adventure.”	1
By	1
this	1
he	1
felt	1
himself	1
so	1
inspired	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
flinched	1
if	1
all	1
the	1
carriers	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
had	1
assailed	1
him.	1
The	1
comrades	1
of	1
the	1
wounded	1
perceiving	1
the	1
plight	1
they	1
were	1
in	1
began	1
from	1
a	1
distance	1
to	1
shower	1
stones	1
on	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
who	1
screened	1
himself	1
as	1
best	1
he	1
could	1
with	1
his	1
buckler,	1
not	1
daring	1
to	1
quit	1
the	1
trough	1
and	1
leave	1
his	1
armour	1
unprotected.	1
The	1
landlord	1
shouted	1
to	1
them	1
to	1
leave	1
him	1
alone,	1
for	1
he	1
had	1
already	1
told	1
them	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
mad,	1
and	1
as	1
a	1
madman	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
accountable	1
even	1
if	1
he	1
killed	1
them	1
all.	1
Still	1
louder	1
shouted	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
calling	1
them	1
knaves	1
and	1
traitors,	1
and	1
the	1
lord	1
of	1
the	1
castle,	1
who	1
allowed	1
knights-errant	1
to	1
be	1
treated	1
in	1
this	1
fashion,	1
a	1
villain	1
and	1
a	1
low-born	1
knight	1
whom,	1
had	1
he	1
received	1
the	1
order	1
of	1
knighthood,	1
he	1
would	1
call	1
to	1
account	1
for	1
his	1
treachery.	1
“But	1
of	1
you,”	1
he	1
cried,	1
“base	1
and	1
vile	1
rabble,	1
I	1
make	1
no	1
account;	1
fling,	1
strike,	1
come	1
on,	1
do	1
all	1
ye	1
can	1
against	1
me,	1
ye	1
shall	1
see	1
what	1
the	1
reward	1
of	1
your	1
folly	1
and	1
insolence	1
will	1
be.”	1
This	1
he	1
uttered	1
with	1
so	1
much	1
spirit	1
and	1
boldness	1
that	1
he	1
filled	1
his	1
assailants	1
with	1
a	1
terrible	1
fear,	1
and	1
as	1
much	1
for	1
this	1
reason	1
as	1
at	1
the	1
persuasion	1
of	1
the	1
landlord	1
they	1
left	1
off	1
stoning	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
allowed	1
them	1
to	1
carry	1
off	1
the	1
wounded,	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
calmness	1
and	1
composure	1
as	1
before	1
resumed	1
the	1
watch	1
over	1
his	1
armour.	1
But	1
these	1
freaks	1
of	1
his	1
guest	1
were	1
not	1
much	1
to	1
the	1
liking	1
of	1
the	1
landlord,	1
so	1
he	1
determined	1
to	1
cut	1
matters	1
short	1
and	1
confer	1
upon	1
him	1
at	1
once	1
the	1
unlucky	1
order	1
of	1
knighthood	1
before	1
any	1
further	1
misadventure	1
could	1
occur;	1
so,	1
going	1
up	1
to	1
him,	1
he	1
apologised	1
for	1
the	1
rudeness	1
which,	1
without	1
his	1
knowledge,	1
had	1
been	1
offered	1
to	1
him	1
by	1
these	1
low	1
people,	1
who,	1
however,	1
had	1
been	1
well	1
punished	1
for	1
their	1
audacity.	1
As	1
he	1
had	1
already	1
told	1
him,	1
he	1
said,	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
chapel	1
in	1
the	1
castle,	1
nor	1
was	1
it	1
needed	1
for	1
what	1
remained	1
to	1
be	1
done,	1
for,	1
as	1
he	1
understood	1
the	1
ceremonial	1
of	1
the	1
order,	1
the	1
whole	1
point	1
of	1
being	1
dubbed	1
a	1
knight	1
lay	1
in	1
the	1
accolade	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
slap	1
on	1
the	1
shoulder,	1
and	1
that	1
could	1
be	1
administered	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
a	1
field;	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
now	1
done	1
all	1
that	1
was	1
needful	1
as	1
to	1
watching	1
the	1
armour,	1
for	1
all	1
requirements	1
were	1
satisfied	1
by	1
a	1
watch	1
of	1
two	1
hours	1
only,	1
while	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
more	1
than	1
four	1
about	1
it.	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
believed	1
it	1
all,	1
and	1
told	1
him	1
he	1
stood	1
there	1
ready	1
to	1
obey	1
him,	1
and	1
to	1
make	1
an	1
end	1
of	1
it	1
with	1
as	1
much	1
despatch	1
as	1
possible;	1
for,	1
if	1
he	1
were	1
again	1
attacked,	1
and	1
felt	1
himself	1
to	1
be	1
dubbed	1
knight,	1
he	1
would	1
not,	1
he	1
thought,	1
leave	1
a	1
soul	1
alive	1
in	1
the	1
castle,	1
except	1
such	1
as	1
out	1
of	1
respect	1
he	1
might	1
spare	1
at	1
his	1
bidding.	1
Thus	1
warned	1
and	1
menaced,	1
the	1
castellan	1
forthwith	1
brought	1
out	1
a	1
book	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
used	1
to	1
enter	1
the	1
straw	1
and	1
barley	1
he	1
served	1
out	1
to	1
the	1
carriers,	1
and,	1
with	1
a	1
lad	1
carrying	1
a	1
candle-end,	1
and	1
the	1
two	1
damsels	1
already	1
mentioned,	1
he	1
returned	1
to	1
where	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
stood,	1
and	1
bade	1
him	1
kneel	1
down.	1
Then,	1
reading	1
from	1
his	1
account-book	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
were	1
repeating	1
some	1
devout	1
prayer,	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
his	1
delivery	1
he	1
raised	1
his	1
hand	1
and	1
gave	1
him	1
a	1
sturdy	1
blow	1
on	1
the	1
neck,	1
and	1
then,	1
with	1
his	1
own	1
sword,	1
a	1
smart	1
slap	1
on	1
the	1
shoulder,	1
all	1
the	1
while	1
muttering	1
between	1
his	1
teeth	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
was	1
saying	1
his	1
prayers.	1
Having	1
done	1
this,	1
he	1
directed	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
ladies	1
to	1
gird	1
on	1
his	1
sword,	1
which	1
she	1
did	1
with	1
great	1
self-possession	1
and	1
gravity,	1
and	1
not	1
a	1
little	1
was	1
required	1
to	1
prevent	1
a	1
burst	1
of	1
laughter	1
at	1
each	1
stage	1
of	1
the	1
ceremony;	1
but	1
what	1
they	1
had	1
already	1
seen	1
of	1
the	1
novice	1
knight’s	1
prowess	1
kept	1
their	1
laughter	1
within	1
bounds.	1
On	1
girding	1
him	1
with	1
the	1
sword	1
the	1
worthy	1
lady	1
said	1
to	1
him,	1
“May	1
God	1
make	1
your	1
worship	1
a	1
very	1
fortunate	1
knight,	1
and	1
grant	1
you	1
success	1
in	1
battle.”	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
asked	1
her	1
name	1
in	1
order	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
from	1
that	1
time	1
forward	1
know	1
to	1
whom	1
he	1
was	1
beholden	1
for	1
the	1
favour	1
he	1
had	1
received,	1
as	1
he	1
meant	1
to	1
confer	1
upon	1
her	1
some	1
portion	1
of	1
the	1
honour	1
he	1
acquired	1
by	1
the	1
might	1
of	1
his	1
arm.	1
She	1
answered	1
with	1
great	1
humility	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
called	1
La	1
Tolosa,	1
and	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
a	1
cobbler	1
of	1
Toledo	1
who	1
lived	1
in	1
the	1
stalls	1
of	1
Sanchobienaya,	1
and	1
that	1
wherever	1
she	1
might	1
be	1
she	1
would	1
serve	1
and	1
esteem	1
him	1
as	1
her	1
lord.	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
said	1
in	1
reply	1
that	1
she	1
would	1
do	1
him	1
a	1
favour	1
if	1
thenceforward	1
she	1
assumed	1
the	1
“Don”	1
and	1
called	1
herself	1
Doña	1
Tolosa.	1
She	1
promised	1
she	1
would,	1
and	1
then	1
the	1
other	1
buckled	1
on	1
his	1
spur,	1
and	1
with	1
her	1
followed	1
almost	1
the	1
same	1
conversation	1
as	1
with	1
the	1
lady	1
of	1
the	1
sword.	1
He	1
asked	1
her	1
name,	1
and	1
she	1
said	1
it	1
was	1
La	1
Molinera,	1
and	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
a	1
respectable	1
miller	1
of	1
Antequera;	1
and	1
of	1
her	1
likewise	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
requested	1
that	1
she	1
would	1
adopt	1
the	1
“Don”	1
and	1
call	1
herself	1
Doña	1
Molinera,	1
making	1
offers	1
to	1
her	1
further	1
services	1
and	1
favours.	1
Having	1
thus,	1
with	1
hot	1
haste	1
and	1
speed,	1
brought	1
to	1
a	1
conclusion	1
these	1
never-till-now-seen	1
ceremonies,	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
was	1
on	1
thorns	1
until	1
he	1
saw	1
himself	1
on	1
horseback	1
sallying	1
forth	1
in	1
quest	1
of	1
adventures;	1
and	1
saddling	1
Rocinante	1
at	1
once	1
he	1
mounted,	1
and	1
embracing	1
his	1
host,	1
as	1
he	1
returned	1
thanks	1
for	1
his	1
kindness	1
in	1
knighting	1
him,	1
he	1
addressed	1
him	1
in	1
language	1
so	1
extraordinary	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
impossible	1
to	1
convey	1
an	1
idea	1
of	1
it	1
or	1
report	1
it.	1
The	1
landlord,	1
to	1
get	1
him	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
inn,	1
replied	1
with	1
no	1
less	1
rhetoric	1
though	1
with	1
shorter	1
words,	1
and	1
without	1
calling	1
upon	1
him	1
to	1
pay	1
the	1
reckoning	1
let	1
him	1
go	1
with	1
a	1
Godspeed.	1

IV.	1
OF	1
WHAT	1
HAPPENED	1
TO	1
OUR	1
KNIGHT	1
WHEN	1
HE	1
LEFT	1
THE	1

Day	1
was	1
dawning	1
when	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
quitted	1
the	1
inn,	1
so	1
happy,	1
so	1
gay,	1
so	1
exhilarated	1
at	1
finding	1
himself	1
now	1
dubbed	1
a	1
knight,	1
that	1
his	1
joy	1
was	1
like	1
to	1
burst	1
his	1
horse-girths.	1
However,	1
recalling	1
the	1
advice	1
of	1
his	1
host	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
requisites	1
he	1
ought	1
to	1
carry	1
with	1
him,	1
especially	1
that	1
referring	1
to	1
money	1
and	1
shirts,	1
he	1
determined	1
to	1
go	1
home	1
and	1
provide	1
himself	1
with	1
all,	1
and	1
also	1
with	1
a	1
squire,	1
for	1
he	1
reckoned	1
upon	1
securing	1
a	1
farm-labourer,	1
a	1
neighbour	1
of	1
his,	1
a	1
poor	1
man	1
with	1
a	1
family,	1
but	1
very	1
well	1
qualified	1
for	1
the	1
office	1
of	1
squire	1
to	1
a	1
knight.	1
With	1
this	1
object	1
he	1
turned	1
his	1
horse’s	1
head	1
towards	1
his	1
village,	1
and	1
Rocinante,	1
thus	1
reminded	1
of	1
his	1
old	1
quarters,	1
stepped	1
out	1
so	1
briskly	1
that	1
he	1
hardly	1
seemed	1
to	1
tread	1
the	1
earth.	1
He	1
had	1
not	1
gone	1
far,	1
when	1
out	1
of	1
a	1
thicket	1
on	1
his	1
right	1
there	1
seemed	1
to	1
come	1
feeble	1
cries	1
as	1
of	1
someone	1
in	1
distress,	1
and	1
the	1
instant	1
he	1
heard	1
them	1
he	1
exclaimed,	1
“Thanks	1
be	1
to	1
heaven	1
for	1
the	1
favour	1
it	1
accords	1
me,	1
that	1
it	1
so	1
soon	1
offers	1
me	1
an	1
opportunity	1
of	1
fulfilling	1
the	1
obligation	1
I	1
have	1
undertaken,	1
and	1
gathering	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
my	1
ambition.	1
These	1
cries,	1
no	1
doubt,	1
come	1
from	1
some	1
man	1
or	1
woman	1
in	1
want	1
of	1
help,	1
and	1
needing	1
my	1
aid	1
and	1
protection;”	1
and	1
wheeling,	1
he	1
turned	1
Rocinante	1
in	1
the	1
direction	1
whence	1
the	1
cries	1
seemed	1
to	1
proceed.	1
He	1
had	1
gone	1
but	1
a	1
few	1
paces	1
into	1
the	1
wood,	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
a	1
mare	1
tied	1
to	1
an	1
oak,	1
and	1
tied	1
to	1
another,	1
and	1
stripped	1
from	1
the	1
waist	1
upwards,	1
a	1
youth	1
of	1
about	1
fifteen	1
years	1
of	1
age,	1
from	1
whom	1
the	1
cries	1
came.	1
Nor	1
were	1
they	1
without	1
cause,	1
for	1
a	1
lusty	1
farmer	1
was	1
flogging	1
him	1
with	1
a	1
belt	1
and	1
following	1
up	1
every	1
blow	1
with	1
scoldings	1
and	1
commands,	1
repeating,	1
“Your	1
mouth	1
shut	1
and	1
your	1
eyes	1
open!”	1
while	1
the	1
youth	1
made	1
answer,	1
“I	1
won’t	1
do	1
it	1
again,	1
master	1
mine;	1
by	1
God’s	1
passion	1
I	1
won’t	1
do	1
it	1
again,	1
and	1
I’ll	1
take	1
more	1
care	1
of	1
the	1
flock	1
another	1
time.”	1
Seeing	1
what	1
was	1
going	1
on,	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
said	1
in	1
an	1
angry	1
voice,	1
“Discourteous	1
knight,	1
it	1
ill	1
becomes	1
you	1
to	1
assail	1
one	1
who	1
cannot	1
defend	1
himself;	1
mount	1
your	1
steed	1
and	1
take	1
your	1
lance”	1
(for	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
lance	1
leaning	1
against	1
the	1
oak	1
to	1
which	1
the	1
mare	1
was	1
tied),	1
“and	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
you	1
know	1
that	1
you	1
are	1
behaving	1
as	1
a	1
coward.”	1
The	1
farmer,	1
seeing	1
before	1
him	1
this	1
figure	1
in	1
full	1
armour	1
brandishing	1
a	1
lance	1
over	1
his	1
head,	1
gave	1
himself	1
up	1
for	1
dead,	1
and	1
made	1
answer	1
meekly,	1
“Sir	1
Knight,	1
this	1
youth	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
chastising	1
is	1
my	1
servant,	1
employed	1
by	1
me	1
to	1
watch	1
a	1
flock	1
of	1
sheep	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
hard	1
by,	1
and	1
he	1
is	1
so	1
careless	1
that	1
I	1
lose	1
one	1
every	1
day,	1
and	1
when	1
I	1
punish	1
him	1
for	1
his	1
carelessness	1
and	1
knavery	1
he	1
says	1
I	1
do	1
it	1
out	1
of	1
niggardliness,	1
to	1
escape	1
paying	1
him	1
the	1
wages	1
I	1
owe	1
him,	1
and	1
before	1
God,	1
and	1
on	1
my	1
soul,	1
he	1
lies.”	1
“Lies	1
before	1
me,	1
base	1
clown!”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote.	1
“By	1
the	1
sun	1
that	1
shines	1
on	1
us	1
I	1
have	1
a	1
mind	1
to	1
run	1
you	1
through	1
with	1
this	1
lance.	1
Pay	1
him	1
at	1
once	1
without	1
another	1
word;	1
if	1
not,	1
by	1
the	1
God	1
that	1
rules	1
us	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
an	1
end	1
of	1
you,	1
and	1
annihilate	1
you	1
on	1
the	1
spot;	1
release	1
him	1
instantly.”	1

The	1
farmer	1
hung	1
his	1
head,	1
and	1
without	1
a	1
word	1
untied	1
his	1
servant,	1
of	1
whom	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
asked	1
how	1
much	1
his	1
master	1
owed	1
him.	1
He	1
replied,	1
nine	1
months	1
at	1
seven	1
reals	1
a	1
month.	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
added	1
it	1
up,	1
found	1
that	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
sixty-three	1
reals,	1
and	1
told	1
the	1
farmer	1
to	1
pay	1
it	1
down	1
immediately,	1
if	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
want	1
to	1
die	1
for	1
it.	1
The	1
trembling	1
clown	1
replied	1
that	1
as	1
he	1
lived	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
oath	1
he	1
had	1
sworn	1
(though	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
sworn	1
any)	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
so	1
much;	1
for	1
there	1
were	1
to	1
be	1
taken	1
into	1
account	1
and	1
deducted	1
three	1
pairs	1
of	1
shoes	1
he	1
had	1
given	1
him,	1
and	1
a	1
real	1
for	1
two	1
blood-lettings	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
sick.	1
“All	1
that	1
is	1
very	1
well,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
“but	1
let	1
the	1
shoes	1
and	1
the	1
blood-lettings	1
stand	1
as	1
a	1
setoff	1
against	1
the	1
blows	1
you	1
have	1
given	1
him	1
without	1
any	1
cause;	1
for	1
if	1
he	1
spoiled	1
the	1
leather	1
of	1
the	1
shoes	1
you	1
paid	1
for,	1
you	1
have	1
damaged	1
that	1
of	1
his	1
body,	1
and	1
if	1
the	1
barber	1
took	1
blood	1
from	1
him	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
sick,	1
you	1
have	1
drawn	1
it	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
sound;	1
so	1
on	1
that	1
score	1
he	1
owes	1
you	1
nothing.”	1
“The	1
difficulty	1
is,	1
Sir	1
Knight,	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
money	1
here;	1
let	1
Andres	1
come	1
home	1
with	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
pay	1
him	1
all,	1
real	1
by	1
real.”	1
“I	1
go	1
with	1
him!”	1
said	1
the	1
youth.	1
“Nay,	1
God	1
forbid!	1
No,	1
señor,	1
not	1
for	1
the	1
world;	1
for	1
once	1
alone	1
with	1
me,	1
he	1
would	1
ray	1
me	1
like	1
a	1
Saint	1
Bartholomew.”	1
“He	1
will	1
do	1
nothing	1
of	1
the	1
kind,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
“I	1
have	1
only	1
to	1
command,	1
and	1
he	1
will	1
obey	1
me;	1
and	1
as	1
he	1
has	1
sworn	1
to	1
me	1
by	1
the	1
order	1
of	1
knighthood	1
which	1
he	1
has	1
received,	1
I	1
leave	1
him	1
free,	1
and	1
I	1
guarantee	1
the	1
payment.”	1
“Consider	1
what	1
you	1
are	1
saying,	1
señor,”	1
said	1
the	1
youth;	1
“this	1
master	1
of	1
mine	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
knight,	1
nor	1
has	1
he	1
received	1
any	1
order	1
of	1
knighthood;	1
for	1
he	1
is	1
Juan	1
Haldudo	1
the	1
Rich,	1
of	1
Quintanar.”	1
“That	1
matters	1
little,”	1
replied	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
“there	1
may	1
be	1
Haldudos	1
knights;	1
moreover,	1
everyone	1
is	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
his	1
works.”	1
“That	1
is	1
true,”	1
said	1
Andres;	1
“but	1
this	1
master	1
of	1
mine—of	1
what	1
works	1
is	1
he	1
the	1
son,	1
when	1
he	1
refuses	1
me	1
the	1
wages	1
of	1
my	1
sweat	1
and	1
labour?”	1
“I	1
do	1
not	1
refuse,	1
brother	1
Andres,”	1
said	1
the	1
farmer,	1
“be	1
good	1
enough	1
to	1
come	1
along	1
with	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
swear	1
by	1
all	1
the	1
orders	1
of	1
knighthood	1
there	1
are	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
to	1
pay	1
you	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
agreed,	1
real	1
by	1
real,	1
and	1
perfumed.”	1
“For	1
the	1
perfumery	1
I	1
excuse	1
you,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
“give	1
it	1
to	1
him	1
in	1
reals,	1
and	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
satisfied;	1
and	1
see	1
that	1
you	1
do	1
as	1
you	1
have	1
sworn;	1
if	1
not,	1
by	1
the	1
same	1
oath	1
I	1
swear	1
to	1
come	1
back	1
and	1
hunt	1
you	1
out	1
and	1
punish	1
you;	1
and	1
I	1
shall	1
find	1
you	1
though	1
you	1
should	1
lie	1
closer	1
than	1
a	1
lizard.	1
And	1
if	1
you	1
desire	1
to	1
know	1
who	1
it	1
is	1
lays	1
this	1
command	1
upon	1
you,	1
that	1
you	1
be	1
more	1
firmly	1
bound	1
to	1
obey	1
it,	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
valorous	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
of	1
La	1
Mancha,	1
the	1
undoer	1
of	1
wrongs	1
and	1
injustices;	1
and	1
so,	1
God	1
be	1
with	1
you,	1
and	1
keep	1
in	1
mind	1
what	1
you	1
have	1
promised	1
and	1
sworn	1
under	1
those	1
penalties	1
that	1
have	1
been	1
already	1
declared	1
to	1
you.”	1
So	1
saying,	1
he	1
gave	1
Rocinante	1
the	1
spur	1
and	1
was	1
soon	1
out	1
of	1
reach.	1
The	1
farmer	1
followed	1
him	1
with	1
his	1
eyes,	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
cleared	1
the	1
wood	1
and	1
was	1
no	1
longer	1
in	1
sight,	1
he	1
turned	1
to	1
his	1
boy	1
Andres,	1
and	1
said,	1
“Come	1
here,	1
my	1
son,	1
I	1
want	1
to	1
pay	1
you	1
what	1
I	1
owe	1
you,	1
as	1
that	1
undoer	1
of	1
wrongs	1
has	1
commanded	1
me.”	1
“My	1
oath	1
on	1
it,”	1
said	1
Andres,	1
“your	1
worship	1
will	1
be	1
well	1
advised	1
to	1
obey	1
the	1
command	1
of	1
that	1
good	1
knight—may	1
he	1
live	1
a	1
thousand	1
years—for,	1
as	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
valiant	1
and	1
just	1
judge,	1
by	1
Roque,	1
if	1
you	1
do	1
not	1
pay	1
me,	1
he	1
will	1
come	1
back	1
and	1
do	1
as	1
he	1
said.”	1
“My	1
oath	1
on	1
it,	1
too,”	1
said	1
the	1
farmer;	1
“but	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
a	1
strong	1
affection	1
for	1
you,	1
I	1
want	1
to	1
add	1
to	1
the	1
debt	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
add	1
to	1
the	1
payment;”	1
and	1
seizing	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
arm,	1
he	1
tied	1
him	1
up	1
again,	1
and	1
gave	1
him	1
such	1
a	1
flogging	1
that	1
he	1
left	1
him	1
for	1
dead.	1
“Now,	1
Master	1
Andres,”	1
said	1
the	1
farmer,	1
“call	1
on	1
the	1
undoer	1
of	1
wrongs;	1
you	1
will	1
find	1
he	1
won’t	1
undo	1
that,	1
though	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
sure	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
quite	1
done	1
with	1
you,	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
a	1
good	1
mind	1
to	1
flay	1
you	1
alive.”	1
But	1
at	1
last	1
he	1
untied	1
him,	1
and	1
gave	1
him	1
leave	1
to	1
go	1
look	1
for	1
his	1
judge	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
put	1
the	1
sentence	1
pronounced	1
into	1
execution.	1
Andres	1
went	1
off	1
rather	1
down	1
in	1
the	1
mouth,	1
swearing	1
he	1
would	1
go	1
to	1
look	1
for	1
the	1
valiant	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
of	1
La	1
Mancha	1
and	1
tell	1
him	1
exactly	1
what	1
had	1
happened,	1
and	1
that	1
all	1
would	1
have	1
to	1
be	1
repaid	1
him	1
sevenfold;	1
but	1
for	1
all	1
that,	1
he	1
went	1
off	1
weeping,	1
while	1
his	1
master	1
stood	1
laughing.	1
Thus	1
did	1
the	1
valiant	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
right	1
that	1
wrong,	1
and,	1
thoroughly	1
satisfied	1
with	1
what	1
had	1
taken	1
place,	1
as	1
he	1
considered	1
he	1
had	1
made	1
a	1
very	1
happy	1
and	1
noble	1
beginning	1
with	1
his	1
knighthood,	1
he	1
took	1
the	1
road	1
towards	1
his	1
village	1
in	1
perfect	1
self-content,	1
saying	1
in	1
a	1
low	1
voice,	1
“Well	1
mayest	1
thou	1
this	1
day	1
call	1
thyself	1
fortunate	1
above	1
all	1
on	1
earth,	1
O	1
Dulcinea	1
del	1
Toboso,	1
fairest	1
of	1
the	1
fair!	1
since	1
it	1
has	1
fallen	1
to	1
thy	1
lot	1
to	1
hold	1
subject	1
and	1
submissive	1
to	1
thy	1
full	1
will	1
and	1
pleasure	1
a	1
knight	1
so	1
renowned	1
as	1
is	1
and	1
will	1
be	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
of	1
La	1
Mancha,	1
who,	1
as	1
all	1
the	1
world	1
knows,	1
yesterday	1
received	1
the	1
order	1
of	1
knighthood,	1
and	1
hath	1
to-day	1
righted	1
the	1
greatest	1
wrong	1
and	1
grievance	1
that	1
ever	1
injustice	1
conceived	1
and	1
cruelty	1
perpetrated:	1
who	1
hath	1
to-day	1
plucked	1
the	1
rod	1
from	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
yonder	1
ruthless	1
oppressor	1
so	1
wantonly	1
lashing	1
that	1
tender	1
child.”	1
He	1
now	1
came	1
to	1
a	1
road	1
branching	1
in	1
four	1
directions,	1
and	1
immediately	1
he	1
was	1
reminded	1
of	1
those	1
cross-roads	1
where	1
knights-errant	1
used	1
to	1
stop	1
to	1
consider	1
which	1
road	1
they	1
should	1
take.	1
In	1
imitation	1
of	1
them	1
he	1
halted	1
for	1
a	1
while,	1
and	1
after	1
having	1
deeply	1
considered	1
it,	1
he	1
gave	1
Rocinante	1
his	1
head,	1
submitting	1
his	1
own	1
will	1
to	1
that	1
of	1
his	1
hack,	1
who	1
followed	1
out	1
his	1
first	1
intention,	1
which	1
was	1
to	1
make	1
straight	1
for	1
his	1
own	1
stable.	1
After	1
he	1
had	1
gone	1
about	1
two	1
miles	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
perceived	1
a	1
large	1
party	1
of	1
people,	1
who,	1
as	1
afterwards	1
appeared,	1
were	1
some	1
Toledo	1
traders,	1
on	1
their	1
way	1
to	1
buy	1
silk	1
at	1
Murcia.	1
There	1
were	1
six	1
of	1
them	1
coming	1
along	1
under	1
their	1
sunshades,	1
with	1
four	1
servants	1
mounted,	1
and	1
three	1
muleteers	1
on	1
foot.	1
Scarcely	1
had	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
descried	1
them	1
when	1
the	1
fancy	1
possessed	1
him	1
that	1
this	1
must	1
be	1
some	1
new	1
adventure;	1
and	1
to	1
help	1
him	1
to	1
imitate	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
he	1
could	1
those	1
passages	1
he	1
had	1
read	1
of	1
in	1
his	1
books,	1
here	1
seemed	1
to	1
come	1
one	1
made	1
on	1
purpose,	1
which	1
he	1
resolved	1
to	1
attempt.	1
So	1
with	1
a	1
lofty	1
bearing	1
and	1
determination	1
he	1
fixed	1
himself	1
firmly	1
in	1
his	1
stirrups,	1
got	1
his	1
lance	1
ready,	1
brought	1
his	1
buckler	1
before	1
his	1
breast,	1
and	1
planting	1
himself	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
road,	1
stood	1
waiting	1
the	1
approach	1
of	1
these	1
knights-errant,	1
for	1
such	1
he	1
now	1
considered	1
and	1
held	1
them	1
to	1
be;	1
and	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
come	1
near	1
enough	1
to	1
see	1
and	1
hear,	1
he	1
exclaimed	1
with	1
a	1
haughty	1
gesture,	1
“All	1
the	1
world	1
stand,	1
unless	1
all	1
the	1
world	1
confess	1
that	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
world	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
maiden	1
fairer	1
than	1
the	1
Empress	1
of	1
La	1
Mancha,	1
the	1
peerless	1
Dulcinea	1
del	1
Toboso.”	1
The	1
traders	1
halted	1
at	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
this	1
language	1
and	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
strange	1
figure	1
that	1
uttered	1
it,	1
and	1
from	1
both	1
figure	1
and	1
language	1
at	1
once	1
guessed	1
the	1
craze	1
of	1
their	1
owner;	1
they	1
wished,	1
however,	1
to	1
learn	1
quietly	1
what	1
was	1
the	1
object	1
of	1
this	1
confession	1
that	1
was	1
demanded	1
of	1
them,	1
and	1
one	1
of	1
them,	1
who	1
was	1
rather	1
fond	1
of	1
a	1
joke	1
and	1
was	1
very	1
sharp-witted,	1
said	1
to	1
him,	1
“Sir	1
Knight,	1
we	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
who	1
this	1
good	1
lady	1
is	1
that	1
you	1
speak	1
of;	1
show	1
her	1
to	1
us,	1
for,	1
if	1
she	1
be	1
of	1
such	1
beauty	1
as	1
you	1
suggest,	1
with	1
all	1
our	1
hearts	1
and	1
without	1
any	1
pressure	1
we	1
will	1
confess	1
the	1
truth	1
that	1
is	1
on	1
your	1
part	1
required	1
of	1
us.”	1
“If	1
I	1
were	1
to	1
show	1
her	1
to	1
you,”	1
replied	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“what	1
merit	1
would	1
you	1
have	1
in	1
confessing	1
a	1
truth	1
so	1
manifest?	1
The	1
essential	1
point	1
is	1
that	1
without	1
seeing	1
her	1
you	1
must	1
believe,	1
confess,	1
affirm,	1
swear,	1
and	1
defend	1
it;	1
else	1
ye	1
have	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
me	1
in	1
battle,	1
ill-conditioned,	1
arrogant	1
rabble	1
that	1
ye	1
are;	1
and	1
come	1
ye	1
on,	1
one	1
by	1
one	1
as	1
the	1
order	1
of	1
knighthood	1
requires,	1
or	1
all	1
together	1
as	1
is	1
the	1
custom	1
and	1
vile	1
usage	1
of	1
your	1
breed,	1
here	1
do	1
I	1
bide	1
and	1
await	1
you	1
relying	1
on	1
the	1
justice	1
of	1
the	1
cause	1
I	1
maintain.”	1
“Sir	1
Knight,”	1
replied	1
the	1
trader,	1
“I	1
entreat	1
your	1
worship	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
this	1
present	1
company	1
of	1
princes,	1
that,	1
to	1
save	1
us	1
from	1
charging	1
our	1
consciences	1
with	1
the	1
confession	1
of	1
a	1
thing	1
we	1
have	1
never	1
seen	1
or	1
heard	1
of,	1
and	1
one	1
moreover	1
so	1
much	1
to	1
the	1
prejudice	1
of	1
the	1
Empresses	1
and	1
Queens	1
of	1
the	1
Alcarria	1
and	1
Estremadura,	1
your	1
worship	1
will	1
be	1
pleased	1
to	1
show	1
us	1
some	1
portrait	1
of	1
this	1
lady,	1
though	1
it	1
be	1
no	1
bigger	1
than	1
a	1
grain	1
of	1
wheat;	1
for	1
by	1
the	1
thread	1
one	1
gets	1
at	1
the	1
ball,	1
and	1
in	1
this	1
way	1
we	1
shall	1
be	1
satisfied	1
and	1
easy,	1
and	1
you	1
will	1
be	1
content	1
and	1
pleased;	1
nay,	1
I	1
believe	1
we	1
are	1
already	1
so	1
far	1
agreed	1
with	1
you	1
that	1
even	1
though	1
her	1
portrait	1
should	1
show	1
her	1
blind	1
of	1
one	1
eye,	1
and	1
distilling	1
vermilion	1
and	1
sulphur	1
from	1
the	1
other,	1
we	1
would	1
nevertheless,	1
to	1
gratify	1
your	1
worship,	1
say	1
all	1
in	1
her	1
favour	1
that	1
you	1
desire.”	1
“She	1
distils	1
nothing	1
of	1
the	1
kind,	1
vile	1
rabble,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
burning	1
with	1
rage,	1
“nothing	1
of	1
the	1
kind,	1
I	1
say,	1
only	1
ambergris	1
and	1
civet	1
in	1
cotton;	1
nor	1
is	1
she	1
one-eyed	1
or	1
humpbacked,	1
but	1
straighter	1
than	1
a	1
Guadarrama	1
spindle:	1
but	1
ye	1
must	1
pay	1
for	1
the	1
blasphemy	1
ye	1
have	1
uttered	1
against	1
beauty	1
like	1
that	1
of	1
my	1
lady.”	1
And	1
so	1
saying,	1
he	1
charged	1
with	1
levelled	1
lance	1
against	1
the	1
one	1
who	1
had	1
spoken,	1
with	1
such	1
fury	1
and	1
fierceness	1
that,	1
if	1
luck	1
had	1
not	1
contrived	1
that	1
Rocinante	1
should	1
stumble	1
midway	1
and	1
come	1
down,	1
it	1
would	1
have	1
gone	1
hard	1
with	1
the	1
rash	1
trader.	1
Down	1
went	1
Rocinante,	1
and	1
over	1
went	1
his	1
master,	1
rolling	1
along	1
the	1
ground	1
for	1
some	1
distance;	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
tried	1
to	1
rise	1
he	1
was	1
unable,	1
so	1
encumbered	1
was	1
he	1
with	1
lance,	1
buckler,	1
spurs,	1
helmet,	1
and	1
the	1
weight	1
of	1
his	1
old	1
armour;	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
while	1
he	1
was	1
struggling	1
to	1
get	1
up	1
he	1
kept	1
saying,	1
“Fly	1
not,	1
cowards	1
and	1
caitiffs!	1
stay,	1
for	1
not	1
by	1
my	1
fault,	1
but	1
my	1
horse’s,	1
am	1
I	1
stretched	1
here.”	1

One	1
of	1
the	1
muleteers	1
in	1
attendance,	1
who	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
had	1
much	1
good	1
nature	1
in	1
him,	1
hearing	1
the	1
poor	1
prostrate	1
man	1
blustering	1
in	1
this	1
style,	1
was	1
unable	1
to	1
refrain	1
from	1
giving	1
him	1
an	1
answer	1
on	1
his	1
ribs;	1
and	1
coming	1
up	1
to	1
him	1
he	1
seized	1
his	1
lance,	1
and	1
having	1
broken	1
it	1
in	1
pieces,	1
with	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
he	1
began	1
so	1
to	1
belabour	1
our	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
that,	1
notwithstanding	1
and	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
his	1
armour,	1
he	1
milled	1
him	1
like	1
a	1
measure	1
of	1
wheat.	1
His	1
masters	1
called	1
out	1
not	1
to	1
lay	1
on	1
so	1
hard	1
and	1
to	1
leave	1
him	1
alone,	1
but	1
the	1
muleteers	1
blood	1
was	1
up,	1
and	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
care	1
to	1
drop	1
the	1
game	1
until	1
he	1
had	1
vented	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
his	1
wrath,	1
and	1
gathering	1
up	1
the	1
remaining	1
fragments	1
of	1
the	1
lance	1
he	1
finished	1
with	1
a	1
discharge	1
upon	1
the	1
unhappy	1
victim,	1
who	1
all	1
through	1
the	1
storm	1
of	1
sticks	1
that	1
rained	1
on	1
him	1
never	1
ceased	1
threatening	1
heaven,	1
and	1
earth,	1
and	1
the	1
brigands,	1
for	1
such	1
they	1
seemed	1
to	1
him.	1
At	1
last	1
the	1
muleteer	1
was	1
tired,	1
and	1
the	1
traders	1
continued	1
their	1
journey,	1
taking	1
with	1
them	1
matter	1
for	1
talk	1
about	1
the	1
poor	1
fellow	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
cudgelled.	1
He	1
when	1
he	1
found	1
himself	1
alone	1
made	1
another	1
effort	1
to	1
rise;	1
but	1
if	1
he	1
was	1
unable	1
when	1
whole	1
and	1
sound,	1
how	1
was	1
he	1
to	1
rise	1
after	1
having	1
been	1
thrashed	1
and	1
well-nigh	1
knocked	1
to	1
pieces?	1
And	1
yet	1
he	1
esteemed	1
himself	1
fortunate,	1
as	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
this	1
was	1
a	1
regular	1
knight-errant’s	1
mishap,	1
and	1
entirely,	1
he	1
considered,	1
the	1
fault	1
of	1
his	1
horse.	1
However,	1
battered	1
in	1
body	1
as	1
he	1
was,	1
to	1
rise	1
was	1
beyond	1
his	1
power.	1

Finding,	1
then,	1
that,	1
in	1
fact	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
move,	1
he	1
thought	1
himself	1
of	1
having	1
recourse	1
to	1
his	1
usual	1
remedy,	1
which	1
was	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
some	1
passage	1
in	1
his	1
books,	1
and	1
his	1
craze	1
brought	1
to	1
his	1
mind	1
that	1
about	1
Baldwin	1
and	1
the	1
Marquis	1
of	1
Mantua,	1
when	1
Carloto	1
left	1
him	1
wounded	1
on	1
the	1
mountainside,	1
a	1
story	1
known	1
by	1
heart	1
by	1
the	1
children,	1
not	1
forgotten	1
by	1
the	1
young	1
men,	1
and	1
lauded	1
and	1
even	1
believed	1
by	1
the	1
old	1
folk;	1
and	1
for	1
all	1
that	1
not	1
a	1
whit	1
truer	1
than	1
the	1
miracles	1
of	1
Mahomet.	1
This	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
to	1
fit	1
exactly	1
the	1
case	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
found	1
himself,	1
so,	1
making	1
a	1
show	1
of	1
severe	1
suffering,	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
roll	1
on	1
the	1
ground	1
and	1
with	1
feeble	1
breath	1
repeat	1
the	1
very	1
words	1
which	1
the	1
wounded	1
knight	1
of	1
the	1
wood	1
is	1
said	1
to	1
have	1
uttered:	1
Where	1
art	1
thou,	1
lady	1
mine,	1
that	1
thou	1
My	1
sorrow	1
dost	1
not	1
rue?	1
Thou	1
canst	1
not	1
know	1
it,	1
lady	1
mine,	1
Or	1
else	1
thou	1
art	1
untrue.	1
And	1
so	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
with	1
the	1
ballad	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
the	1
lines:	1
O	1
noble	1
Marquis	1
of	1
Mantua,	1
My	1
Uncle	1
and	1
liege	1
lord!	1

As	1
chance	1
would	1
have	1
it,	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
got	1
to	1
this	1
line	1
there	1
happened	1
to	1
come	1
by	1
a	1
peasant	1
from	1
his	1
own	1
village,	1
a	1
neighbour	1
of	1
his,	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
with	1
a	1
load	1
of	1
wheat	1
to	1
the	1
mill,	1
and	1
he,	1
seeing	1
the	1
man	1
stretched	1
there,	1
came	1
up	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
asked	1
him	1
who	1
he	1
was	1
and	1
what	1
was	1
the	1
matter	1
with	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
complained	1
so	1
dolefully.	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
was	1
firmly	1
persuaded	1
that	1
this	1
was	1
the	1
Marquis	1
of	1
Mantua,	1
his	1
uncle,	1
so	1
the	1
only	1
answer	1
he	1
made	1
was	1
to	1
go	1
on	1
with	1
his	1
ballad,	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
told	1
the	1
tale	1
of	1
his	1
misfortune,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
loves	1
of	1
the	1
Emperor’s	1
son	1
and	1
his	1
wife	1
all	1
exactly	1
as	1
the	1
ballad	1
sings	1
it.	1
The	1
peasant	1
stood	1
amazed	1
at	1
hearing	1
such	1
nonsense,	1
and	1
relieving	1
him	1
of	1
the	1
visor,	1
already	1
battered	1
to	1
pieces	1
by	1
blows,	1
he	1
wiped	1
his	1
face,	1
which	1
was	1
covered	1
with	1
dust,	1
and	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
so	1
he	1
recognised	1
him	1
and	1
said,	1
“Señor	1
Quixada”	1
(for	1
so	1
he	1
appears	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
called	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
his	1
senses	1
and	1
had	1
not	1
yet	1
changed	1
from	1
a	1
quiet	1
country	1
gentleman	1
into	1
a	1
knight-errant),	1
“who	1
has	1
brought	1
your	1
worship	1
to	1
this	1
pass?”	1
But	1
to	1
all	1
questions	1
the	1
other	1
only	1
went	1
on	1
with	1
his	1
ballad.	1
Seeing	1
this,	1
the	1
good	1
man	1
removed	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
he	1
could	1
his	1
breastplate	1
and	1
backpiece	1
to	1
see	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
any	1
wound,	1
but	1
he	1
could	1
perceive	1
no	1
blood	1
nor	1
any	1
mark	1
whatever.	1
He	1
then	1
contrived	1
to	1
raise	1
him	1
from	1
the	1
ground,	1
and	1
with	1
no	1
little	1
difficulty	1
hoisted	1
him	1
upon	1
his	1
ass,	1
which	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
easiest	1
mount	1
for	1
him;	1
and	1
collecting	1
the	1
arms,	1
even	1
to	1
the	1
splinters	1
of	1
the	1
lance,	1
he	1
tied	1
them	1
on	1
Rocinante,	1
and	1
leading	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
bridle	1
and	1
the	1
ass	1
by	1
the	1
halter	1
he	1
took	1
the	1
road	1
for	1
the	1
village,	1
very	1
sad	1
to	1
hear	1
what	1
absurd	1
stuff	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
was	1
talking.	1

Size	1
Nor	1
was	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
less	1
so,	1
for	1
what	1
with	1
blows	1
and	1
bruises	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
sit	1
upright	1
on	1
the	1
ass,	1
and	1
from	1
time	1
to	1
time	1
he	1
sent	1
up	1
sighs	1
to	1
heaven,	1
so	1
that	1
once	1
more	1
he	1
drove	1
the	1
peasant	1
to	1
ask	1
what	1
ailed	1
him.	1
And	1
it	1
could	1
have	1
been	1
only	1
the	1
devil	1
himself	1
that	1
put	1
into	1
his	1
head	1
tales	1
to	1
match	1
his	1
own	1
adventures,	1
for	1
now,	1
forgetting	1
Baldwin,	1
he	1
bethought	1
himself	1
of	1
the	1
Moor	1
Abindarraez,	1
when	1
the	1
Alcaide	1
of	1
Antequera,	1
Rodrigo	1
de	1
Narvaez,	1
took	1
him	1
prisoner	1
and	1
carried	1
him	1
away	1
to	1
his	1
castle;	1
so	1
that	1
when	1
the	1
peasant	1
again	1
asked	1
him	1
how	1
he	1
was	1
and	1
what	1
ailed	1
him,	1
he	1
gave	1
him	1
for	1
reply	1
the	1
same	1
words	1
and	1
phrases	1
that	1
the	1
captive	1
Abindarraez	1
gave	1
to	1
Rodrigo	1
de	1
Narvaez,	1
just	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
read	1
the	1
story	1
in	1
the	1
“Diana”	1
of	1
Jorge	1
de	1
Montemayor	1
where	1
it	1
is	1
written,	1
applying	1
it	1
to	1
his	1
own	1
case	1
so	1
aptly	1
that	1
the	1
peasant	1
went	1
along	1
cursing	1
his	1
fate	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
listen	1
to	1
such	1
a	1
lot	1
of	1
nonsense;	1
from	1
which,	1
however,	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
conclusion	1
that	1
his	1
neighbour	1
was	1
mad,	1
and	1
so	1
made	1
all	1
haste	1
to	1
reach	1
the	1
village	1
to	1
escape	1
the	1
wearisomeness	1
of	1
this	1
harangue	1
of	1
Don	1
Quixote’s;	1
who,	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
it,	1
said,	1
“Señor	1
Don	1
Rodrigo	1
de	1
Narvaez,	1
your	1
worship	1
must	1
know	1
that	1
this	1
fair	1
Xarifa	1
I	1
have	1
mentioned	1
is	1
now	1
the	1
lovely	1
Dulcinea	1
del	1
Toboso,	1
for	1
whom	1
I	1
have	1
done,	1
am	1
doing,	1
and	1
will	1
do	1
the	1
most	1
famous	1
deeds	1
of	1
chivalry	1
that	1
in	1
this	1
world	1
have	1
been	1
seen,	1
are	1
to	1
be	1
seen,	1
or	1
ever	1
shall	1
be	1
seen.”	1
To	1
this	1
the	1
peasant	1
answered,	1
“Señor—sinner	1
that	1
I	1
am!—cannot	1
your	1
worship	1
see	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
Don	1
Rodrigo	1
de	1
Narvaez	1
nor	1
the	1
Marquis	1
of	1
Mantua,	1
but	1
Pedro	1
Alonso	1
your	1
neighbour,	1
and	1
that	1
your	1
worship	1
is	1
neither	1
Baldwin	1
nor	1
Abindarraez,	1
but	1
the	1
worthy	1
gentleman	1
Señor	1
Quixada?”	1
“I	1
know	1
who	1
I	1
am,”	1
replied	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“and	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
be	1
not	1
only	1
those	1
I	1
have	1
named,	1
but	1
all	1
the	1
Twelve	1
Peers	1
of	1
France	1
and	1
even	1
all	1
the	1
Nine	1
Worthies,	1
since	1
my	1
achievements	1
surpass	1
all	1
that	1
they	1
have	1
done	1
all	1
together	1
and	1
each	1
of	1
them	1
on	1
his	1
own	1
account.”	1
With	1
this	1
talk	1
and	1
more	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
kind	1
they	1
reached	1
the	1
village	1
just	1
as	1
night	1
was	1
beginning	1
to	1
fall,	1
but	1
the	1
peasant	1
waited	1
until	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
little	1
later	1
that	1
the	1
belaboured	1
gentleman	1
might	1
not	1
be	1
seen	1
riding	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
miserable	1
trim.	1
When	1
it	1
was	1
what	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
the	1
proper	1
time	1
he	1
entered	1
the	1
village	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
Don	1
Quixote’s	1
house,	1
which	1
he	1
found	1
all	1
in	1
confusion,	1
and	1
there	1
were	1
the	1
curate	1
and	1
the	1
village	1
barber,	1
who	1
were	1
great	1
friends	1
of	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
and	1
his	1
housekeeper	1
was	1
saying	1
to	1
them	1
in	1
a	1
loud	1
voice,	1
“What	1
does	1
your	1
worship	1
think	1
can	1
have	1
befallen	1
my	1
master,	1
Señor	1
Licentiate	1
Pero	1
Perez?”	1
for	1
so	1
the	1
curate	1
was	1
called;	1
“it	1
is	1
three	1
days	1
now	1
since	1
anything	1
has	1
been	1
seen	1
of	1
him,	1
or	1
the	1
hack,	1
or	1
the	1
buckler,	1
lance,	1
or	1
armour.	1
Miserable	1
me!	1
I	1
am	1
certain	1
of	1
it,	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
as	1
true	1
as	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
born	1
to	1
die,	1
that	1
these	1
accursed	1
books	1
of	1
chivalry	1
he	1
has,	1
and	1
has	1
got	1
into	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
reading	1
so	1
constantly,	1
have	1
upset	1
his	1
reason;	1
for	1
now	1
I	1
remember	1
having	1
often	1
heard	1
him	1
saying	1
to	1
himself	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
turn	1
knight-errant	1
and	1
go	1
all	1
over	1
the	1
world	1
in	1
quest	1
of	1
adventures.	1
To	1
the	1
devil	1
and	1
Barabbas	1
with	1
such	1
books,	1
that	1
have	1
brought	1
to	1
ruin	1
in	1
this	1
way	1
the	1
finest	1
understanding	1
there	1
was	1
in	1
all	1
La	1
Mancha!”	1
The	1
niece	1
said	1
the	1
same,	1
and,	1
more:	1
“You	1
must	1
know,	1
Master	1
Nicholas”—for	1
that	1
was	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
barber—“it	1
was	1
often	1
my	1
uncle’s	1
way	1
to	1
stay	1
two	1
days	1
and	1
nights	1
together	1
poring	1
over	1
these	1
unholy	1
books	1
of	1
misventures,	1
after	1
which	1
he	1
would	1
fling	1
the	1
book	1
away	1
and	1
snatch	1
up	1
his	1
sword	1
and	1
fall	1
to	1
slashing	1
the	1
walls;	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
tired	1
out	1
he	1
would	1
say	1
he	1
had	1
killed	1
four	1
giants	1
like	1
four	1
towers;	1
and	1
the	1
sweat	1
that	1
flowed	1
from	1
him	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
weary	1
he	1
said	1
was	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
the	1
wounds	1
he	1
had	1
received	1
in	1
battle;	1
and	1
then	1
he	1
would	1
drink	1
a	1
great	1
jug	1
of	1
cold	1
water	1
and	1
become	1
calm	1
and	1
quiet,	1
saying	1
that	1
this	1
water	1
was	1
a	1
most	1
precious	1
potion	1
which	1
the	1
sage	1
Esquife,	1
a	1
great	1
magician	1
and	1
friend	1
of	1
his,	1
had	1
brought	1
him.	1
But	1
I	1
take	1
all	1
the	1
blame	1
upon	1
myself	1
for	1
never	1
having	1
told	1
your	1
worships	1
of	1
my	1
uncle’s	1
vagaries,	1
that	1
you	1
might	1
put	1
a	1
stop	1
to	1
them	1
before	1
things	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
this	1
pass,	1
and	1
burn	1
all	1
these	1
accursed	1
books—for	1
he	1
has	1
a	1
great	1
number—that	1
richly	1
deserve	1
to	1
be	1
burned	1
like	1
heretics.”	1
“So	1
say	1
I	1
too,”	1
said	1
the	1
curate,	1
“and	1
by	1
my	1
faith	1
to-morrow	1
shall	1
not	1
pass	1
without	1
public	1
judgment	1
upon	1
them,	1
and	1
may	1
they	1
be	1
condemned	1
to	1
the	1
flames	1
lest	1
they	1
lead	1
those	1
that	1
read	1
to	1
behave	1
as	1
my	1
good	1
friend	1
seems	1
to	1
have	1
behaved.”	1
All	1
this	1
the	1
peasant	1
heard,	1
and	1
from	1
it	1
he	1
understood	1
at	1
last	1
what	1
was	1
the	1
matter	1
with	1
his	1
neighbour,	1
so	1
he	1
began	1
calling	1
aloud,	1
“Open,	1
your	1
worships,	1
to	1
Señor	1
Baldwin	1
and	1
to	1
Señor	1
the	1
Marquis	1
of	1
Mantua,	1
who	1
comes	1
badly	1
wounded,	1
and	1
to	1
Señor	1
Abindarraez,	1
the	1
Moor,	1
whom	1
the	1
valiant	1
Rodrigo	1
de	1
Narvaez,	1
the	1
Alcaide	1
of	1
Antequera,	1
brings	1
captive.”	1
At	1
these	1
words	1
they	1
all	1
hurried	1
out,	1
and	1
when	1
they	1
recognised	1
their	1
friend,	1
master,	1
and	1
uncle,	1
who	1
had	1
not	1
yet	1
dismounted	1
from	1
the	1
ass	1
because	1
he	1
could	1
not,	1
they	1
ran	1
to	1
embrace	1
him.	1
“Hold!”	1
said	1
he,	1
“for	1
I	1
am	1
badly	1
wounded	1
through	1
my	1
horse’s	1
fault;	1
carry	1
me	1
to	1
bed,	1
and	1
if	1
possible	1
send	1
for	1
the	1
wise	1
Urganda	1
to	1
cure	1
and	1
see	1
to	1
my	1
wounds.”	1
“See	1
there!	1
plague	1
on	1
it!”	1
cried	1
the	1
housekeeper	1
at	1
this:	1
“did	1
not	1
my	1
heart	1
tell	1
the	1
truth	1
as	1
to	1
which	1
foot	1
my	1
master	1
went	1
lame	1
of?	1
To	1
bed	1
with	1
your	1
worship	1
at	1
once,	1
and	1
we	1
will	1
contrive	1
to	1
cure	1
you	1
here	1
without	1
fetching	1
that	1
Hurgada.	1
A	1
curse	1
I	1
say	1
once	1
more,	1
and	1
a	1
hundred	1
times	1
more,	1
on	1
those	1
books	1
of	1
chivalry	1
that	1
have	1
brought	1
your	1
worship	1
to	1
such	1
a	1
pass.”	1
They	1
carried	1
him	1
to	1
bed	1
at	1
once,	1
and	1
after	1
searching	1
for	1
his	1
wounds	1
could	1
find	1
none,	1
but	1
he	1
said	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
bruises	1
from	1
having	1
had	1
a	1
severe	1
fall	1
with	1
his	1
horse	1
Rocinante	1
when	1
in	1
combat	1
with	1
ten	1
giants,	1
the	1
biggest	1
and	1
the	1
boldest	1
to	1
be	1
found	1
on	1
earth.	1
“So,	1
so!”	1
said	1
the	1
curate,	1
“are	1
there	1
giants	1
in	1
the	1
dance?	1
By	1
the	1
sign	1
of	1
the	1
Cross	1
I	1
will	1
burn	1
them	1
to-morrow	1
before	1
the	1
day	1
is	1
over.”	1
They	1
put	1
a	1
host	1
of	1
questions	1
to	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
but	1
his	1
only	1
answer	1
to	1
all	1
was—give	1
him	1
something	1
to	1
eat,	1
and	1
leave	1
him	1
to	1
sleep,	1
for	1
that	1
was	1
what	1
he	1
needed	1
most.	1
They	1
did	1
so,	1
and	1
the	1
curate	1
questioned	1
the	1
peasant	1
at	1
great	1
length	1
as	1
to	1
how	1
he	1
had	1
found	1
Don	1
Quixote.	1
He	1
told	1
him,	1
and	1
the	1
nonsense	1
he	1
had	1
talked	1
when	1
found	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
way	1
home,	1
all	1
which	1
made	1
the	1
licentiate	1
the	1
more	1
eager	1
to	1
do	1
what	1
he	1
did	1
the	1
next	1
day,	1
which	1
was	1
to	1
summon	1
his	1
friend	1
the	1
barber,	1
Master	1
Nicholas,	1
and	1
go	1
with	1
him	1
to	1
Don	1
Quixote’s	1
house.	1

OF	1
THE	1
DIVERTING	1
AND	1
IMPORTANT	1
SCRUTINY	1
WHICH	1
THE	1
CURATE	1
AND	1
THE	1
BARBER	1
MADE	1
IN	1

LIBRARY	1
OF	1
OUR	1
INGENIOUS	1
GENTLEMAN	1

Full	1
Size	1
He	1
was	1
still	1
sleeping;	1
so	1
the	1
curate	1
asked	1
the	1
niece	1
for	1
the	1
keys	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
where	1
the	1
books,	1
the	1
authors	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
mischief,	1
were,	1
and	1
right	1
willingly	1
she	1
gave	1
them.	1
They	1
all	1
went	1
in,	1
the	1
housekeeper	1
with	1
them,	1
and	1
found	1
more	1
than	1
a	1
hundred	1
volumes	1
of	1
big	1
books	1
very	1
well	1
bound,	1
and	1
some	1
other	1
small	1
ones.	1
The	1
moment	1
the	1
housekeeper	1
saw	1
them	1
she	1
turned	1
about	1
and	1
ran	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
room,	1
and	1
came	1
back	1
immediately	1
with	1
a	1
saucer	1
of	1
holy	1
water	1
and	1
a	1
sprinkler,	1
saying,	1
“Here,	1
your	1
worship,	1
señor	1
licentiate,	1
sprinkle	1
this	1
room;	1
don’t	1
leave	1
any	1
magician	1
of	1
the	1
many	1
there	1
are	1
in	1
these	1
books	1
to	1
bewitch	1
us	1
in	1
revenge	1
for	1
our	1
design	1
of	1
banishing	1
them	1
from	1
the	1
world.”	1
The	1
simplicity	1
of	1
the	1
housekeeper	1
made	1
the	1
licentiate	1
laugh,	1
and	1
he	1
directed	1
the	1
barber	1
to	1
give	1
him	1
the	1
books	1
one	1
by	1
one	1
to	1
see	1
what	1
they	1
were	1
about,	1
as	1
there	1
might	1
be	1
some	1
to	1
be	1
found	1
among	1
them	1
that	1
did	1
not	1
deserve	1
the	1
penalty	1
of	1
fire.	1
“No,”	1
said	1
the	1
niece,	1
“there	1
is	1
no	1
reason	1
for	1
showing	1
mercy	1
to	1
any	1
of	1
them;	1
they	1
have	1
every	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
done	1
mischief;	1
better	1
fling	1
them	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
window	1
into	1
the	1
court	1
and	1
make	1
a	1
pile	1
of	1
them	1
and	1
set	1
fire	1
to	1
them;	1
or	1
else	1
carry	1
them	1
into	1
the	1
yard,	1
and	1
there	1
a	1
bonfire	1
can	1
be	1
made	1
without	1
the	1
smoke	1
giving	1
any	1
annoyance.”	1
The	1
housekeeper	1
said	1
the	1
same,	1
so	1
eager	1
were	1
they	1
both	1
for	1
the	1
slaughter	1
of	1
those	1
innocents,	1
but	1
the	1
curate	1
would	1
not	1
agree	1
to	1
it	1
without	1
first	1
reading	1
at	1
any	1
rate	1
the	1
titles.	1
The	1
first	1
that	1
Master	1
Nicholas	1
put	1
into	1
his	1
hand	1
was	1
“The	1
four	1
books	1
of	1
Amadis	1
of	1
Gaul.”	1
“This	1
seems	1
a	1
mysterious	1
thing,”	1
said	1
the	1
curate,	1
“for,	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
heard	1
say,	1
this	1
was	1
the	1
first	1
book	1
of	1
chivalry	1
printed	1
in	1
Spain,	1
and	1
from	1
this	1
all	1
the	1
others	1
derive	1
their	1
birth	1
and	1
origin;	1
so	1
it	1
seems	1
to	1
me	1
that	1
we	1
ought	1
inexorably	1
to	1
condemn	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
flames	1
as	1
the	1
founder	1
of	1
so	1
vile	1
a	1
sect.”	1
“Nay,	1
sir,”	1
said	1
the	1
barber,	1
“I	1
too,	1
have	1
heard	1
say	1
that	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
best	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
books	1
of	1
this	1
kind	1
that	1
have	1
been	1
written,	1
and	1
so,	1
as	1
something	1
singular	1
in	1
its	1
line,	1
it	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
pardoned.”	1
“True,”	1
said	1
the	1
curate;	1
“and	1
for	1
that	1
reason	1
let	1
its	1
life	1
be	1
spared	1
for	1
the	1
present.	1
Let	1
us	1
see	1
that	1
other	1
which	1
is	1
next	1
to	1
it.”	1
“It	1
is,”	1
said	1
the	1
barber,	1
“the	1
‘Sergas	1
de	1
Esplandian,’	1
the	1
lawful	1
son	1
of	1
Amadis	1
of	1
Gaul.”	1
“Then	1
verily,”	1
said	1
the	1
curate,	1
“the	1
merit	1
of	1
the	1
father	1
must	1
not	1
be	1
put	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
account	1
of	1
the	1
son.	1
Take	1
it,	1
mistress	1
housekeeper;	1
open	1
the	1
window	1
and	1
fling	1
it	1
into	1
the	1
yard	1
and	1
lay	1
the	1
foundation	1
of	1
the	1
pile	1
for	1
the	1
bonfire	1
we	1
are	1
to	1
make.”	1
The	1
housekeeper	1
obeyed	1
with	1
great	1
satisfaction,	1
and	1
the	1
worthy	1
“Esplandian”	1
went	1
flying	1
into	1
the	1
yard	1
to	1
await	1
with	1
all	1
patience	1
the	1
fire	1
that	1
was	1
in	1
store	1
for	1
him.	1
“Proceed,”	1
said	1
the	1
curate.	1
“This	1
that	1
comes	1
next,”	1
said	1
the	1
barber,	1
“is	1
‘Amadis	1
of	1
Greece,’	1
and,	1
indeed,	1
I	1
believe	1
all	1
those	1
on	1
this	1
side	1
are	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
Amadis	1
lineage.”	1
“Then	1
to	1
the	1
yard	1
with	1
the	1
whole	1
of	1
them,”	1
said	1
the	1
curate;	1
“for	1
to	1
have	1
the	1
burning	1
of	1
Queen	1
Pintiquiniestra,	1
and	1
the	1
shepherd	1
Darinel	1
and	1
his	1
eclogues,	1
and	1
the	1
bedevilled	1
and	1
involved	1
discourses	1
of	1
his	1
author,	1
I	1
would	1
burn	1
with	1
them	1
the	1
father	1
who	1
begot	1
me	1
if	1
he	1
were	1
going	1
about	1
in	1
the	1
guise	1
of	1
a	1
knight-errant.”	1
“I	1
am	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
mind,”	1
said	1
the	1
barber.	1
“And	1
so	1
am	1
I,”	1
added	1
the	1
niece.	1
“In	1
that	1
case,”	1
said	1
the	1
housekeeper,	1
“here,	1
into	1
the	1
yard	1
with	1
them!”	1
They	1
were	1
handed	1
to	1
her,	1
and	1
as	1
there	1
were	1
many	1
of	1
them,	1
she	1
spared	1
herself	1
the	1
staircase,	1
and	1
flung	1
them	1
down	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
window.	1
“Who	1
is	1
that	1
tub	1
there?”	1
said	1
the	1
curate.	1
“This,”	1
said	1
the	1
barber,	1
“is	1
‘Don	1
Olivante	1
de	1
Laura.’”	1
“The	1
author	1
of	1
that	1
book,”	1
said	1
the	1
curate,	1
“was	1
the	1
same	1
that	1
wrote	1
‘The	1
Garden	1
of	1
Flowers,’	1
and	1
truly	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
deciding	1
which	1
of	1
the	1
two	1
books	1
is	1
the	1
more	1
truthful,	1
or,	1
to	1
put	1
it	1
better,	1
the	1
less	1
lying;	1
all	1
I	1
can	1
say	1
is,	1
send	1
this	1
one	1
into	1
the	1
yard	1
for	1
a	1
swaggering	1
fool.”	1
“This	1
that	1
follows	1
is	1
‘Florismarte	1
of	1
Hircania,’”	1
said	1
the	1
barber.	1
“Señor	1
Florismarte	1
here?”	1
said	1
the	1
curate;	1
“then	1
by	1
my	1
faith	1
he	1
must	1
take	1
up	1
his	1
quarters	1
in	1
the	1
yard,	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
his	1
marvellous	1
birth	1
and	1
visionary	1
adventures,	1
for	1
the	1
stiffness	1
and	1
dryness	1
of	1
his	1
style	1
deserve	1
nothing	1
else;	1
into	1
the	1
yard	1
with	1
him	1
and	1
the	1
other,	1
mistress	1
housekeeper.”	1
“With	1
all	1
my	1
heart,	1
señor,”	1
said	1
she,	1
and	1
executed	1
the	1
order	1
with	1
great	1
delight.	1
“This,”	1
said	1
the	1
barber,	1
“is	1
‘The	1
Knight	1
Platir.’”	1
“An	1
old	1
book	1
that,”	1
said	1
the	1
curate,	1
“but	1
I	1
find	1
no	1
reason	1
for	1
clemency	1
in	1
it;	1
send	1
it	1
after	1
the	1
others	1
without	1
appeal;”	1
which	1
was	1
done.	1
Another	1
book	1
was	1
opened,	1
and	1
they	1
saw	1
it	1
was	1
entitled,	1
“The	1
Knight	1
of	1
the	1
Cross.”	1
“For	1
the	1
sake	1
of	1
the	1
holy	1
name	1
this	1
book	1
has,”	1
said	1
the	1
curate,	1
“its	1
ignorance	1
might	1
be	1
excused;	1
but	1
then,	1
they	1
say,	1
‘behind	1
the	1
cross	1
there’s	1
the	1
devil;’	1
to	1
the	1
fire	1
with	1
it.”	1
Taking	1
down	1
another	1
book,	1
the	1
barber	1
said,	1
“This	1
is	1
‘The	1
Mirror	1
of	1
Chivalry.’”	1
“I	1
know	1
his	1
worship,”	1
said	1
the	1
curate;	1
“that	1
is	1
where	1
Señor	1
Reinaldos	1
of	1
Montalvan	1
figures	1
with	1
his	1
friends	1
and	1
comrades,	1
greater	1
thieves	1
than	1
Cacus,	1
and	1
the	1
Twelve	1
Peers	1
of	1
France	1
with	1
the	1
veracious	1
historian	1
Turpin;	1
however,	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
for	1
condemning	1
them	1
to	1
more	1
than	1
perpetual	1
banishment,	1
because,	1
at	1
any	1
rate,	1
they	1
have	1
some	1
share	1
in	1
the	1
invention	1
of	1
the	1
famous	1
Matteo	1
Boiardo,	1
whence	1
too	1
the	1
Christian	1
poet	1
Ludovico	1
Ariosto	1
wove	1
his	1
web,	1
to	1
whom,	1
if	1
I	1
find	1
him	1
here,	1
and	1
speaking	1
any	1
language	1
but	1
his	1
own,	1
I	1
shall	1
show	1
no	1
respect	1
whatever;	1
but	1
if	1
he	1
speaks	1
his	1
own	1
tongue	1
I	1
will	1
put	1
him	1
upon	1
my	1
head.”	1
“Well,	1
I	1
have	1
him	1
in	1
Italian,”	1
said	1
the	1
barber,	1
“but	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
understand	1
him.”	1
“Nor	1
would	1
it	1
be	1
well	1
that	1
you	1
should	1
understand	1
him,”	1
said	1
the	1
curate,	1
“and	1
on	1
that	1
score	1
we	1
might	1
have	1
excused	1
the	1
Captain	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
brought	1
him	1
into	1
Spain	1
and	1
turned	1
him	1
into	1
Castilian.	1
He	1
robbed	1
him	1
of	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
of	1
his	1
natural	1
force,	1
and	1
so	1
do	1
all	1
those	1
who	1
try	1
to	1
turn	1
books	1
written	1
in	1
verse	1
into	1
another	1
language,	1
for,	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
pains	1
they	1
take	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
cleverness	1
they	1
show,	1
they	1
never	1
can	1
reach	1
the	1
level	1
of	1
the	1
originals	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
first	1
produced.	1
In	1
short,	1
I	1
say	1
that	1
this	1
book,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
may	1
be	1
found	1
treating	1
of	1
those	1
French	1
affairs,	1
should	1
be	1
thrown	1
into	1
or	1
deposited	1
in	1
some	1
dry	1
well,	1
until	1
after	1
more	1
consideration	1
it	1
is	1
settled	1
what	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
done	1
with	1
them;	1
excepting	1
always	1
one	1
‘Bernardo	1
del	1
Carpio’	1
that	1
is	1
going	1
about,	1
and	1
another	1
called	1
‘Roncesvalles;’	1
for	1
these,	1
if	1
they	1
come	1
into	1
my	1
hands,	1
shall	1
pass	1
at	1
once	1
into	1
those	1
of	1
the	1
housekeeper,	1
and	1
from	1
hers	1
into	1
the	1
fire	1
without	1
any	1
reprieve.”	1
To	1
all	1
this	1
the	1
barber	1
gave	1
his	1
assent,	1
and	1
looked	1
upon	1
it	1
as	1
right	1
and	1
proper,	1
being	1
persuaded	1
that	1
the	1
curate	1
was	1
so	1
staunch	1
to	1
the	1
Faith	1
and	1
loyal	1
to	1
the	1
Truth	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
for	1
the	1
world	1
say	1
anything	1
opposed	1
to	1
them.	1
Opening	1
another	1
book	1
he	1
saw	1
it	1
was	1
“Palmerin	1
de	1
Oliva,”	1
and	1
beside	1
it	1
was	1
another	1
called	1
“Palmerin	1
of	1
England,”	1
seeing	1
which	1
the	1
licentiate	1
said,	1
“Let	1
the	1
Olive	1
be	1
made	1
firewood	1
of	1
at	1
once	1
and	1
burned	1
until	1
no	1
ashes	1
even	1
are	1
left;	1
and	1
let	1
that	1
Palm	1
of	1
England	1
be	1
kept	1
and	1
preserved	1
as	1
a	1
thing	1
that	1
stands	1
alone,	1
and	1
let	1
such	1
another	1
case	1
be	1
made	1
for	1
it	1
as	1
that	1
which	1
Alexander	1
found	1
among	1
the	1
spoils	1
of	1
Darius	1
and	1
set	1
aside	1
for	1
the	1
safe	1
keeping	1
of	1
the	1
works	1
of	1
the	1
poet	1
Homer.	1
This	1
book,	1
gossip,	1
is	1
of	1
authority	1
for	1
two	1
reasons,	1
first	1
because	1
it	1
is	1
very	1
good,	1
and	1
secondly	1
because	1
it	1
is	1
said	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
written	1
by	1
a	1
wise	1
and	1
witty	1
king	1
of	1
Portugal.	1
All	1
the	1
adventures	1
at	1
the	1
Castle	1
of	1
Miraguarda	1
are	1
excellent	1
and	1
of	1
admirable	1
contrivance,	1
and	1
the	1
language	1
is	1
polished	1
and	1
clear,	1
studying	1
and	1
observing	1
the	1
style	1
befitting	1
the	1
speaker	1
with	1
propriety	1
and	1
judgment.	1
So	1
then,	1
provided	1
it	1
seems	1
good	1
to	1
you,	1
Master	1
Nicholas,	1
I	1
say	1
let	1
this	1
and	1
‘Amadis	1
of	1
Gaul’	1
be	1
remitted	1
the	1
penalty	1
of	1
fire,	1
and	1
as	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
rest,	1
let	1
them	1
perish	1
without	1
further	1
question	1
or	1
query.”	1
“Nay,	1
gossip,”	1
said	1
the	1
barber,	1
“for	1
this	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
here	1
is	1
the	1
famous	1
‘Don	1
Belianis.’”	1
“Well,”	1
said	1
the	1
curate,	1
“that	1
and	1
the	1
second,	1
third,	1
and	1
fourth	1
parts	1
all	1
stand	1
in	1
need	1
of	1
a	1
little	1
rhubarb	1
to	1
purge	1
their	1
excess	1
of	1
bile,	1
and	1
they	1
must	1
be	1
cleared	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
stuff	1
about	1
the	1
Castle	1
of	1
Fame	1
and	1
other	1
greater	1
affectations,	1
to	1
which	1
end	1
let	1
them	1
be	1
allowed	1
the	1
over-seas	1
term,	1
and,	1
according	1
as	1
they	1
mend,	1
so	1
shall	1
mercy	1
or	1
justice	1
be	1
meted	1
out	1
to	1
them;	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
mean	1
time,	1
gossip,	1
do	1
you	1
keep	1
them	1
in	1
your	1
house	1
and	1
let	1
no	1
one	1
read	1
them.”	1
“With	1
all	1
my	1
heart,”	1
said	1
the	1
barber;	1
and	1
not	1
caring	1
to	1
tire	1
himself	1
with	1
reading	1
more	1
books	1
of	1
chivalry,	1
he	1
told	1
the	1
housekeeper	1
to	1
take	1
all	1
the	1
big	1
ones	1
and	1
throw	1
them	1
into	1
the	1
yard.	1
It	1
was	1
not	1
said	1
to	1
one	1
dull	1
or	1
deaf,	1
but	1
to	1
one	1
who	1
enjoyed	1
burning	1
them	1
more	1
than	1
weaving	1
the	1
broadest	1
and	1
finest	1
web	1
that	1
could	1
be;	1
and	1
seizing	1
about	1
eight	1
at	1
a	1
time,	1
she	1
flung	1
them	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
window.	1
In	1
carrying	1
so	1
many	1
together	1
she	1
let	1
one	1
fall	1
at	1
the	1
feet	1
of	1
the	1
barber,	1
who	1
took	1
it	1
up,	1
curious	1
to	1
know	1
whose	1
it	1
was,	1
and	1
found	1
it	1
said,	1
“History	1
of	1
the	1
Famous	1
Knight,	1
Tirante	1
el	1
Blanco.”	1
“God	1
bless	1
me!”	1
said	1
the	1
curate	1
with	1
a	1
shout,	1
“‘Tirante	1
el	1
Blanco’	1
here!	1
Hand	1
it	1
over,	1
gossip,	1
for	1
in	1
it	1
I	1
reckon	1
I	1
have	1
found	1
a	1
treasury	1
of	1
enjoyment	1
and	1
a	1
mine	1
of	1
recreation.	1
Here	1
is	1
Don	1
Kyrieleison	1
of	1
Montalvan,	1
a	1
valiant	1
knight,	1
and	1
his	1
brother	1
Thomas	1
of	1
Montalvan,	1
and	1
the	1
knight	1
Fonseca,	1
with	1
the	1
battle	1
the	1
bold	1
Tirante	1
fought	1
with	1
the	1
mastiff,	1
and	1
the	1
witticisms	1
of	1
the	1
damsel	1
Placerdemivida,	1
and	1
the	1
loves	1
and	1
wiles	1
of	1
the	1
widow	1
Reposada,	1
and	1
the	1
empress	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
the	1
squire	1
Hipolito—in	1
truth,	1
gossip,	1
by	1
right	1
of	1
its	1
style	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
best	1
book	1
in	1
the	1
world.	1
Here	1
knights	1
eat	1
and	1
sleep,	1
and	1
die	1
in	1
their	1
beds,	1
and	1
make	1
their	1
wills	1
before	1
dying,	1
and	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
more	1
of	1
which	1
there	1
is	1
nothing	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
other	1
books.	1
Nevertheless,	1
I	1
say	1
he	1
who	1
wrote	1
it,	1
for	1
deliberately	1
composing	1
such	1
fooleries,	1
deserves	1
to	1
be	1
sent	1
to	1
the	1
galleys	1
for	1
life.	1
Take	1
it	1
home	1
with	1
you	1
and	1
read	1
it,	1
and	1
you	1
will	1
see	1
that	1
what	1
I	1
have	1
said	1
is	1
true.”	1
“As	1
you	1
will,”	1
said	1
the	1
barber;	1
“but	1
what	1
are	1
we	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
these	1
little	1
books	1
that	1
are	1
left?”	1
“These	1
must	1
be,	1
not	1
chivalry,	1
but	1
poetry,”	1
said	1
the	1
curate;	1
and	1
opening	1
one	1
he	1
saw	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
“Diana”	1
of	1
Jorge	1
de	1
Montemayor,	1
and,	1
supposing	1
all	1
the	1
others	1
to	1
be	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
sort,	1
“these,”	1
he	1
said,	1
“do	1
not	1
deserve	1
to	1
be	1
burned	1
like	1
the	1
others,	1
for	1
they	1
neither	1
do	1
nor	1
can	1
do	1
the	1
mischief	1
the	1
books	1
of	1
chivalry	1
have	1
done,	1
being	1
books	1
of	1
entertainment	1
that	1
can	1
hurt	1
no	1
one.”	1
“Ah,	1
señor!”	1
said	1
the	1
niece,	1
“your	1
worship	1
had	1
better	1
order	1
these	1
to	1
be	1
burned	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
the	1
others;	1
for	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
no	1
wonder	1
if,	1
after	1
being	1
cured	1
of	1
his	1
chivalry	1
disorder,	1
my	1
uncle,	1
by	1
reading	1
these,	1
took	1
a	1
fancy	1
to	1
turn	1
shepherd	1
and	1
range	1
the	1
woods	1
and	1
fields	1
singing	1
and	1
piping;	1
or,	1
what	1
would	1
be	1
still	1
worse,	1
to	1
turn	1
poet,	1
which	1
they	1
say	1
is	1
an	1
incurable	1
and	1
infectious	1
malady.”	1
“The	1
damsel	1
is	1
right,”	1
said	1
the	1
curate,	1
“and	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
well	1
to	1
put	1
this	1
stumbling-block	1
and	1
temptation	1
out	1
of	1
our	1
friend’s	1
way.	1
To	1
begin,	1
then,	1
with	1
the	1
‘Diana’	1
of	1
Montemayor.	1
I	1
am	1
of	1
opinion	1
it	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
burned,	1
but	1
that	1
it	1
should	1
be	1
cleared	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
about	1
the	1
sage	1
Felicia	1
and	1
the	1
magic	1
water,	1
and	1
of	1
almost	1
all	1
the	1
longer	1
pieces	1
of	1
verse:	1
let	1
it	1
keep,	1
and	1
welcome,	1
its	1
prose	1
and	1
the	1
honour	1
of	1
being	1
the	1
first	1
of	1
books	1
of	1
the	1
kind.”	1
“This	1
that	1
comes	1
next,”	1
said	1
the	1
barber,	1
“is	1
the	1
‘Diana,’	1
entitled	1
the	1
‘Second	1
Part,	1
by	1
the	1
Salamancan,’	1
and	1
this	1
other	1
has	1
the	1
same	1
title,	1
and	1
its	1
author	1
is	1
Gil	1
Polo.”	1
“As	1
for	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
Salamancan,”	1
replied	1
the	1
curate,	1
“let	1
it	1
go	1
to	1
swell	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
the	1
condemned	1
in	1
the	1
yard,	1
and	1
let	1
Gil	1
Polo’s	1
be	1
preserved	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
came	1
from	1
Apollo	1
himself:	1
but	1
get	1
on,	1
gossip,	1
and	1
make	1
haste,	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
growing	1
late.”	1
“This	1
book,”	1
said	1
the	1
barber,	1
opening	1
another,	1
“is	1
the	1
ten	1
books	1
of	1
the	1
‘Fortune	1
of	1
Love,’	1
written	1
by	1
Antonio	1
de	1
Lofraso,	1
a	1
Sardinian	1
poet.”	1
“By	1
the	1
orders	1
I	1
have	1
received,”	1
said	1
the	1
curate,	1
“since	1
Apollo	1
has	1
been	1
Apollo,	1
and	1
the	1
Muses	1
have	1
been	1
Muses,	1
and	1
poets	1
have	1
been	1
poets,	1
so	1
droll	1
and	1
absurd	1
a	1
book	1
as	1
this	1
has	1
never	1
been	1
written,	1
and	1
in	1
its	1
way	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
best	1
and	1
the	1
most	1
singular	1
of	1
all	1
of	1
this	1
species	1
that	1
have	1
as	1
yet	1
appeared,	1
and	1
he	1
who	1
has	1
not	1
read	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
sure	1
he	1
has	1
never	1
read	1
what	1
is	1
delightful.	1
Give	1
it	1
here,	1
gossip,	1
for	1
I	1
make	1
more	1
account	1
of	1
having	1
found	1
it	1
than	1
if	1
they	1
had	1
given	1
me	1
a	1
cassock	1
of	1
Florence	1
stuff.”	1
He	1
put	1
it	1
aside	1
with	1
extreme	1
satisfaction,	1
and	1
the	1
barber	1
went	1
on,	1
“These	1
that	1
come	1
next	1
are	1
‘The	1
Shepherd	1
of	1
Iberia,’	1
‘Nymphs	1
of	1
Henares,’	1
and	1
‘The	1
Enlightenment	1
of	1
Jealousy.’”	1
“Then	1
all	1
we	1
have	1
to	1
do,”	1
said	1
the	1
curate,	1
“is	1
to	1
hand	1
them	1
over	1
to	1
the	1
secular	1
arm	1
of	1
the	1
housekeeper,	1
and	1
ask	1
me	1
not	1
why,	1
or	1
we	1
shall	1
never	1
have	1
done.”	1
“This	1
next	1
is	1
the	1
‘Pastor	1
de	1
Fílida.’”	1
“No	1
Pastor	1
that,”	1
said	1
the	1
curate,	1
“but	1
a	1
highly	1
polished	1
courtier;	1
let	1
it	1
be	1
preserved	1
as	1
a	1
precious	1
jewel.”	1
“This	1
large	1
one	1
here,”	1
said	1
the	1
barber,	1
“is	1
called	1
‘The	1
Treasury	1
of	1
various	1
Poems.’”	1
“If	1
there	1
were	1
not	1
so	1
many	1
of	1
them,”	1
said	1
the	1
curate,	1
“they	1
would	1
be	1
more	1
relished:	1
this	1
book	1
must	1
be	1
weeded	1
and	1
cleansed	1
of	1
certain	1
vulgarities	1
which	1
it	1
has	1
with	1
its	1
excellences;	1
let	1
it	1
be	1
preserved	1
because	1
the	1
author	1
is	1
a	1
friend	1
of	1
mine,	1
and	1
out	1
of	1
respect	1
for	1
other	1
more	1
heroic	1
and	1
loftier	1
works	1
that	1
he	1
has	1
written.”	1
“This,”	1
continued	1
the	1
barber,	1
“is	1
the	1
‘Cancionero’	1
of	1
Lopez	1
de	1
Maldonado.”	1
“The	1
author	1
of	1
that	1
book,	1
too,”	1
said	1
the	1
curate,	1
“is	1
a	1
great	1
friend	1
of	1
mine,	1
and	1
his	1
verses	1
from	1
his	1
own	1
mouth	1
are	1
the	1
admiration	1
of	1
all	1
who	1
hear	1
them,	1
for	1
such	1
is	1
the	1
sweetness	1
of	1
his	1
voice	1
that	1
he	1
enchants	1
when	1
he	1
chants	1
them:	1
it	1
gives	1
rather	1
too	1
much	1
of	1
its	1
eclogues,	1
but	1
what	1
is	1
good	1
was	1
never	1
yet	1
plentiful:	1
let	1
it	1
be	1
kept	1
with	1
those	1
that	1
have	1
been	1
set	1
apart.	1
But	1
what	1
book	1
is	1
that	1
next	1
it?”	1
“The	1
‘Galatea’	1
of	1
Miguel	1
de	1
Cervantes,”	1
said	1
the	1
barber.	1
“That	1
Cervantes	1
has	1
been	1
for	1
many	1
years	1
a	1
great	1
friend	1
of	1
mine,	1
and	1
to	1
my	1
knowledge	1
he	1
has	1
had	1
more	1
experience	1
in	1
reverses	1
than	1
in	1
verses.	1
His	1
book	1
has	1
some	1
good	1
invention	1
in	1
it,	1
it	1
presents	1
us	1
with	1
something	1
but	1
brings	1
nothing	1
to	1
a	1
conclusion:	1
we	1
must	1
wait	1
for	1
the	1
Second	1
Part	1
it	1
promises:	1
perhaps	1
with	1
amendment	1
it	1
may	1
succeed	1
in	1
winning	1
the	1
full	1
measure	1
of	1
grace	1
that	1
is	1
now	1
denied	1
it;	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
mean	1
time	1
do	1
you,	1
señor	1
gossip,	1
keep	1
it	1
shut	1
up	1
in	1
your	1
own	1
quarters.”	1
“Very	1
good,”	1
said	1
the	1
barber;	1
“and	1
here	1
come	1
three	1
together,	1
the	1
‘Araucana’	1
of	1
Don	1
Alonso	1
de	1
Ercilla,	1
the	1
‘Austriada’	1
of	1
Juan	1
Rufo,	1
Justice	1
of	1
Cordova,	1
and	1
the	1
‘Montserrate’	1
of	1
Christobal	1
de	1
Virués,	1
the	1
Valencian	1
poet.”	1
“These	1
three	1
books,”	1
said	1
the	1
curate,	1
“are	1
the	1
best	1
that	1
have	1
been	1
written	1
in	1
Castilian	1
in	1
heroic	1
verse,	1
and	1
they	1
may	1
compare	1
with	1
the	1
most	1
famous	1
of	1
Italy;	1
let	1
them	1
be	1
preserved	1
as	1
the	1
richest	1
treasures	1
of	1
poetry	1
that	1
Spain	1
possesses.”	1
The	1
curate	1
was	1
tired	1
and	1
would	1
not	1
look	1
into	1
any	1
more	1
books,	1
and	1
so	1
he	1
decided	1
that,	1
“contents	1
uncertified,”	1
all	1
the	1
rest	1
should	1
be	1
burned;	1
but	1
just	1
then	1
the	1
barber	1
held	1
open	1
one,	1
called	1
“The	1
Tears	1
of	1
Angelica.”	1
“I	1
should	1
have	1
shed	1
tears	1
myself,”	1
said	1
the	1
curate	1
when	1
he	1
heard	1
the	1
title,	1
“had	1
I	1
ordered	1
that	1
book	1
to	1
be	1
burned,	1
for	1
its	1
author	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
famous	1
poets	1
of	1
the	1
world,	1
not	1
to	1
say	1
of	1
Spain,	1
and	1
was	1
very	1
happy	1
in	1
the	1
translation	1
of	1
some	1
of	1
Ovid’s	1
fables.”	1

Full	1
Size	1
At	1
this	1
instant	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
began	1
shouting	1
out,	1
“Here,	1
here,	1
valiant	1
knights!	1
here	1
is	1
need	1
for	1
you	1
to	1
put	1
forth	1
the	1
might	1
of	1
your	1
strong	1
arms,	1
for	1
they	1
of	1
the	1
Court	1
are	1
gaining	1
the	1
mastery	1
in	1
the	1
tourney!”	1
Called	1
away	1
by	1
this	1
noise	1
and	1
outcry,	1
they	1
proceeded	1
no	1
farther	1
with	1
the	1
scrutiny	1
of	1
the	1
remaining	1
books,	1
and	1
so	1
it	1
is	1
thought	1
that	1
“The	1
Carolea,”	1
“The	1
Lion	1
of	1
Spain,”	1
and	1
“The	1
Deeds	1
of	1
the	1
Emperor,”	1
written	1
by	1
Don	1
Luis	1
de	1
Ávila,	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
fire	1
unseen	1
and	1
unheard;	1
for	1
no	1
doubt	1
they	1
were	1
among	1
those	1
that	1
remained,	1
and	1
perhaps	1
if	1
the	1
curate	1
had	1
seen	1
them	1
they	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
undergone	1
so	1
severe	1
a	1
sentence.	1
When	1
they	1
reached	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
he	1
was	1
already	1
out	1
of	1
bed,	1
and	1
was	1
still	1
shouting	1
and	1
raving,	1
and	1
slashing	1
and	1
cutting	1
all	1
round,	1
as	1
wide	1
awake	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
never	1
slept.	1
They	1
closed	1
with	1
him	1
and	1
by	1
force	1
got	1
him	1
back	1
to	1
bed,	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
become	1
a	1
little	1
calm,	1
addressing	1
the	1
curate,	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
him,	1
“Of	1
a	1
truth,	1
Señor	1
Archbishop	1
Turpin,	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
great	1
disgrace	1
for	1
us	1
who	1
call	1
ourselves	1
the	1
Twelve	1
Peers,	1
so	1
carelessly	1
to	1
allow	1
the	1
knights	1
of	1
the	1
Court	1
to	1
gain	1
the	1
victory	1
in	1
this	1
tourney,	1
we	1
the	1
adventurers	1
having	1
carried	1
off	1
the	1
honour	1
on	1
the	1
three	1
former	1
days.”	1
“Hush,	1
gossip,”	1
said	1
the	1
curate;	1
“please	1
God,	1
the	1
luck	1
may	1
turn,	1
and	1
what	1
is	1
lost	1
to-day	1
may	1
be	1
won	1
to-morrow;	1
for	1
the	1
present	1
let	1
your	1
worship	1
have	1
a	1
care	1
of	1
your	1
health,	1
for	1
it	1
seems	1
to	1
me	1
that	1
you	1
are	1
over-fatigued,	1
if	1
not	1
badly	1
wounded.”	1
“Wounded	1
no,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“but	1
bruised	1
and	1
battered	1
no	1
doubt,	1
for	1
that	1
bastard	1
Don	1
Roland	1
has	1
cudgelled	1
me	1
with	1
the	1
trunk	1
of	1
an	1
oak	1
tree,	1
and	1
all	1
for	1
envy,	1
because	1
he	1
sees	1
that	1
I	1
alone	1
rival	1
him	1
in	1
his	1
achievements.	1
But	1
I	1
should	1
not	1
call	1
myself	1
Reinaldos	1
of	1
Montalvan	1
did	1
he	1
not	1
pay	1
me	1
for	1
it	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
all	1
his	1
enchantments	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
I	1
rise	1
from	1
this	1
bed.	1
For	1
the	1
present	1
let	1
them	1
bring	1
me	1
something	1
to	1
eat,	1
for	1
that,	1
I	1
feel,	1
is	1
what	1
will	1
be	1
more	1
to	1
my	1
purpose,	1
and	1
leave	1
it	1
to	1
me	1
to	1
avenge	1
myself.”	1
They	1
did	1
as	1
he	1
wished;	1
they	1
gave	1
him	1
something	1
to	1
eat,	1
and	1
once	1
more	1
he	1
fell	1
asleep,	1
leaving	1
them	1
marvelling	1
at	1
his	1
madness.	1
That	1
night	1
the	1
housekeeper	1
burned	1
to	1
ashes	1
all	1
the	1
books	1
that	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
yard	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
whole	1
house;	1
and	1
some	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
consumed	1
that	1
deserved	1
preservation	1
in	1
everlasting	1
archives,	1
but	1
their	1
fate	1
and	1
the	1
laziness	1
of	1
the	1
examiner	1
did	1
not	1
permit	1
it,	1
and	1
so	1
in	1
them	1
was	1
verified	1
the	1
proverb	1
that	1
the	1
innocent	1
suffer	1
for	1
the	1
guilty.	1
One	1
of	1
the	1
remedies	1
which	1
the	1
curate	1
and	1
the	1
barber	1
immediately	1
applied	1
to	1
their	1
friend’s	1
disorder	1
was	1
to	1
wall	1
up	1
and	1
plaster	1
the	1
room	1
where	1
the	1
books	1
were,	1
so	1
that	1
when	1
he	1
got	1
up	1
he	1
should	1
not	1
find	1
them	1
(possibly	1
the	1
cause	1
being	1
removed	1
the	1
effect	1
might	1
cease),	1
and	1
they	1
might	1
say	1
that	1
a	1
magician	1
had	1
carried	1
them	1
off,	1
room	1
and	1
all;	1
and	1
this	1
was	1
done	1
with	1
all	1
despatch.	1
Two	1
days	1
later	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
got	1
up,	1
and	1
the	1
first	1
thing	1
he	1
did	1
was	1
to	1
go	1
and	1
look	1
at	1
his	1
books,	1
and	1
not	1
finding	1
the	1
room	1
where	1
he	1
had	1
left	1
it,	1
he	1
wandered	1
from	1
side	1
to	1
side	1
looking	1
for	1
it.	1
He	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
the	1
door	1
used	1
to	1
be,	1
and	1
tried	1
it	1
with	1
his	1
hands,	1
and	1
turned	1
and	1
twisted	1
his	1
eyes	1
in	1
every	1
direction	1
without	1
saying	1
a	1
word;	1
but	1
after	1
a	1
good	1
while	1
he	1
asked	1
his	1
housekeeper	1
whereabouts	1
was	1
the	1
room	1
that	1
held	1
his	1
books.	1
The	1
housekeeper,	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
already	1
well	1
instructed	1
in	1
what	1
she	1
was	1
to	1
answer,	1
said,	1
“What	1
room	1
or	1
what	1
nothing	1
is	1
it	1
that	1
your	1
worship	1
is	1
looking	1
for?	1
There	1
are	1
neither	1
room	1
nor	1
books	1
in	1
this	1
house	1
now,	1
for	1
the	1
devil	1
himself	1
has	1
carried	1
all	1
away.”	1
“It	1
was	1
not	1
the	1
devil,”	1
said	1
the	1
niece,	1
“but	1
a	1
magician	1
who	1
came	1
on	1
a	1
cloud	1
one	1
night	1
after	1
the	1
day	1
your	1
worship	1
left	1
this,	1
and	1
dismounting	1
from	1
a	1
serpent	1
that	1
he	1
rode	1
he	1
entered	1
the	1
room,	1
and	1
what	1
he	1
did	1
there	1
I	1
know	1
not,	1
but	1
after	1
a	1
little	1
while	1
he	1
made	1
off,	1
flying	1
through	1
the	1
roof,	1
and	1
left	1
the	1
house	1
full	1
of	1
smoke;	1
and	1
when	1
we	1
went	1
to	1
see	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
we	1
saw	1
neither	1
book	1
nor	1
room:	1
but	1
we	1
remember	1
very	1
well,	1
the	1
housekeeper	1
and	1
I,	1
that	1
on	1
leaving,	1
the	1
old	1
villain	1
said	1
in	1
a	1
loud	1
voice	1
that,	1
for	1
a	1
private	1
grudge	1
he	1
owed	1
the	1
owner	1
of	1
the	1
books	1
and	1
the	1
room,	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
mischief	1
in	1
that	1
house	1
that	1
would	1
be	1
discovered	1
by-and-by:	1
he	1
said	1
too	1
that	1
his	1
name	1
was	1
the	1
Sage	1
Muñaton.”	1
“He	1
must	1
have	1
said	1
Friston,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote.	1
“I	1
don’t	1
know	1
whether	1
he	1
called	1
himself	1
Friston	1
or	1
Friton,”	1
said	1
the	1
housekeeper,	1
“I	1
only	1
know	1
that	1
his	1
name	1
ended	1
with	1
‘ton.’”	1
“So	1
it	1
does,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“and	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
sage	1
magician,	1
a	1
great	1
enemy	1
of	1
mine,	1
who	1
has	1
a	1
spite	1
against	1
me	1
because	1
he	1
knows	1
by	1
his	1
arts	1
and	1
lore	1
that	1
in	1
process	1
of	1
time	1
I	1
am	1
to	1
engage	1
in	1
single	1
combat	1
with	1
a	1
knight	1
whom	1
he	1
befriends	1
and	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
to	1
conquer,	1
and	1
he	1
will	1
be	1
unable	1
to	1
prevent	1
it;	1
and	1
for	1
this	1
reason	1
he	1
endeavours	1
to	1
do	1
me	1
all	1
the	1
ill	1
turns	1
that	1
he	1
can;	1
but	1
I	1
promise	1
him	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
hard	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
oppose	1
or	1
avoid	1
what	1
is	1
decreed	1
by	1
Heaven.”	1
“Who	1
doubts	1
that?”	1
said	1
the	1
niece;	1
“but,	1
uncle,	1
who	1
mixes	1
you	1
up	1
in	1
these	1
quarrels?	1
Would	1
it	1
not	1
be	1
better	1
to	1
remain	1
at	1
peace	1
in	1
your	1
own	1
house	1
instead	1
of	1
roaming	1
the	1
world	1
looking	1
for	1
better	1
bread	1
than	1
ever	1
came	1
of	1
wheat,	1
never	1
reflecting	1
that	1
many	1
go	1
for	1
wool	1
and	1
come	1
back	1
shorn?”	1
“Oh,	1
niece	1
of	1
mine,”	1
replied	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“how	1
much	1
astray	1
art	1
thou	1
in	1
thy	1
reckoning:	1
ere	1
they	1
shear	1
me	1
I	1
shall	1
have	1
plucked	1
away	1
and	1
stripped	1
off	1
the	1
beards	1
of	1
all	1
who	1
dare	1
to	1
touch	1
only	1
the	1
tip	1
of	1
a	1
hair	1
of	1
mine.”	1
The	1
two	1
were	1
unwilling	1
to	1
make	1
any	1
further	1
answer,	1
as	1
they	1
saw	1
that	1
his	1
anger	1
was	1
kindling.	1
In	1
short,	1
then,	1
he	1
remained	1
at	1
home	1
fifteen	1
days	1
very	1
quietly	1
without	1
showing	1
any	1
signs	1
of	1
a	1
desire	1
to	1
take	1
up	1
with	1
his	1
former	1
delusions,	1
and	1
during	1
this	1
time	1
he	1
held	1
lively	1
discussions	1
with	1
his	1
two	1
gossips,	1
the	1
curate	1
and	1
the	1
barber,	1
on	1
the	1
point	1
he	1
maintained,	1
that	1
knights-errant	1
were	1
what	1
the	1
world	1
stood	1
most	1
in	1
need	1
of,	1
and	1
that	1
in	1
him	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
accomplished	1
the	1
revival	1
of	1
knight-errantry.	1
The	1
curate	1
sometimes	1
contradicted	1
him,	1
sometimes	1
agreed	1
with	1
him,	1
for	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
observed	1
this	1
precaution	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
unable	1
to	1
bring	1
him	1
to	1
reason.	1
Meanwhile	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
worked	1
upon	1
a	1
farm	1
labourer,	1
a	1
neighbour	1
of	1
his,	1
an	1
honest	1
man	1
(if	1
indeed	1
that	1
title	1
can	1
be	1
given	1
to	1
him	1
who	1
is	1
poor),	1
but	1
with	1
very	1
little	1
wit	1
in	1
his	1
pate.	1
In	1
a	1
word,	1
he	1
so	1
talked	1
him	1
over,	1
and	1
with	1
such	1
persuasions	1
and	1
promises,	1
that	1
the	1
poor	1
clown	1
made	1
up	1
his	1
mind	1
to	1
sally	1
forth	1
with	1
him	1
and	1
serve	1
him	1
as	1
esquire.	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
among	1
other	1
things,	1
told	1
him	1
he	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
ready	1
to	1
go	1
with	1
him	1
gladly,	1
because	1
any	1
moment	1
an	1
adventure	1
might	1
occur	1
that	1
might	1
win	1
an	1
island	1
in	1
the	1
twinkling	1
of	1
an	1
eye	1
and	1
leave	1
him	1
governor	1
of	1
it.	1
On	1
these	1
and	1
the	1
like	1
promises	1
Sancho	1
Panza	1
(for	1
so	1
the	1
labourer	1
was	1
called)	1
left	1
wife	1
and	1
children,	1
and	1
engaged	1
himself	1
as	1
esquire	1
to	1
his	1
neighbour.	1

Don	1
Quixote	1
next	1
set	1
about	1
getting	1
some	1
money;	1
and	1
selling	1
one	1
thing	1
and	1
pawning	1
another,	1
and	1
making	1
a	1
bad	1
bargain	1
in	1
every	1
case,	1
he	1
got	1
together	1
a	1
fair	1
sum.	1
He	1
provided	1
himself	1
with	1
a	1
buckler,	1
which	1
he	1
begged	1
as	1
a	1
loan	1
from	1
a	1
friend,	1
and,	1
restoring	1
his	1
battered	1
helmet	1
as	1
best	1
he	1
could,	1
he	1
warned	1
his	1
squire	1
Sancho	1
of	1
the	1
day	1
and	1
hour	1
he	1
meant	1
to	1
set	1
out,	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
provide	1
himself	1
with	1
what	1
he	1
thought	1
most	1
needful.	1
Above	1
all,	1
he	1
charged	1
him	1
to	1
take	1
alforjas	1
with	1
him.	1
The	1
other	1
said	1
he	1
would,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
meant	1
to	1
take	1
also	1
a	1
very	1
good	1
ass	1
he	1
had,	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
much	1
given	1
to	1
going	1
on	1
foot.	1
About	1
the	1
ass,	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
hesitated	1
a	1
little,	1
trying	1
whether	1
he	1
could	1
call	1
to	1
mind	1
any	1
knight-errant	1
taking	1
with	1
him	1
an	1
esquire	1
mounted	1
on	1
ass-back,	1
but	1
no	1
instance	1
occurred	1
to	1
his	1
memory.	1
For	1
all	1
that,	1
however,	1
he	1
determined	1
to	1
take	1
him,	1
intending	1
to	1
furnish	1
him	1
with	1
a	1
more	1
honourable	1
mount	1
when	1
a	1
chance	1
of	1
it	1
presented	1
itself,	1
by	1
appropriating	1
the	1
horse	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
discourteous	1
knight	1
he	1
encountered.	1
Himself	1
he	1
provided	1
with	1
shirts	1
and	1
such	1
other	1
things	1
as	1
he	1
could,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
advice	1
the	1
host	1
had	1
given	1
him;	1
all	1
which	1
being	1
done,	1
without	1
taking	1
leave,	1
Sancho	1
Panza	1
of	1
his	1
wife	1
and	1
children,	1
or	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
of	1
his	1
housekeeper	1
and	1
niece,	1
they	1
sallied	1
forth	1
unseen	1
by	1
anybody	1
from	1
the	1
village	1
one	1
night,	1
and	1
made	1
such	1
good	1
way	1
in	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
it	1
that	1
by	1
daylight	1
they	1
held	1
themselves	1
safe	1
from	1
discovery,	1
even	1
should	1
search	1
be	1
made	1
for	1
them.	1
Sancho	1
rode	1
on	1
his	1
ass	1
like	1
a	1
patriarch,	1
with	1
his	1
alforjas	1
and	1
bota,	1
and	1
longing	1
to	1
see	1
himself	1
soon	1
governor	1
of	1
the	1
island	1
his	1
master	1
had	1
promised	1
him.	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
decided	1
upon	1
taking	1
the	1
same	1
route	1
and	1
road	1
he	1
had	1
taken	1
on	1
his	1
first	1
journey,	1
that	1
over	1
the	1
Campo	1
de	1
Montiel,	1
which	1
he	1
travelled	1
with	1
less	1
discomfort	1
than	1
on	1
the	1
last	1
occasion,	1
for,	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
early	1
morning	1
and	1
the	1
rays	1
of	1
the	1
sun	1
fell	1
on	1
them	1
obliquely,	1
the	1
heat	1
did	1
not	1
distress	1
them.	1
And	1
now	1
said	1
Sancho	1
Panza	1
to	1
his	1
master,	1
“Your	1
worship	1
will	1
take	1
care,	1
Señor	1
Knight-errant,	1
not	1
to	1
forget	1
about	1
the	1
island	1
you	1
have	1
promised	1
me,	1
for	1
be	1
it	1
ever	1
so	1
big	1
I’ll	1
be	1
equal	1
to	1
governing	1
it.”	1
To	1
which	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
replied,	1
“Thou	1
must	1
know,	1
friend	1
Sancho	1
Panza,	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
practice	1
very	1
much	1
in	1
vogue	1
with	1
the	1
knights-errant	1
of	1
old	1
to	1
make	1
their	1
squires	1
governors	1
of	1
the	1
islands	1
or	1
kingdoms	1
they	1
won,	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
determined	1
that	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
no	1
failure	1
on	1
my	1
part	1
in	1
so	1
liberal	1
a	1
custom;	1
on	1
the	1
contrary,	1
I	1
mean	1
to	1
improve	1
upon	1
it,	1
for	1
they	1
sometimes,	1
and	1
perhaps	1
most	1
frequently,	1
waited	1
until	1
their	1
squires	1
were	1
old,	1
and	1
then	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
had	1
enough	1
of	1
service	1
and	1
hard	1
days	1
and	1
worse	1
nights,	1
they	1
gave	1
them	1
some	1
title	1
or	1
other,	1
of	1
count,	1
or	1
at	1
the	1
most	1
marquis,	1
of	1
some	1
valley	1
or	1
province	1
more	1
or	1
less;	1
but	1
if	1
thou	1
livest	1
and	1
I	1
live,	1
it	1
may	1
well	1
be	1
that	1
before	1
six	1
days	1
are	1
over,	1
I	1
may	1
have	1
won	1
some	1
kingdom	1
that	1
has	1
others	1
dependent	1
upon	1
it,	1
which	1
will	1
be	1
just	1
the	1
thing	1
to	1
enable	1
thee	1
to	1
be	1
crowned	1
king	1
of	1
one	1
of	1
them.	1
Nor	1
needst	1
thou	1
count	1
this	1
wonderful,	1
for	1
things	1
and	1
chances	1
fall	1
to	1
the	1
lot	1
of	1
such	1
knights	1
in	1
ways	1
so	1
unexampled	1
and	1
unexpected	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
easily	1
give	1
thee	1
even	1
more	1
than	1
I	1
promise	1
thee.”	1
“In	1
that	1
case,”	1
said	1
Sancho	1
Panza,	1
“if	1
I	1
should	1
become	1
a	1
king	1
by	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
miracles	1
your	1
worship	1
speaks	1
of,	1
even	1
Juana	1
Gutierrez,	1
my	1
old	1
woman,	1
would	1
come	1
to	1
be	1
queen	1
and	1
my	1
children	1
infantes.”	1
“Well,	1
who	1
doubts	1
it?”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote.	1
“I	1
doubt	1
it,”	1
replied	1
Sancho	1
Panza,	1
“because	1
for	1
my	1
part	1
I	1
am	1
persuaded	1
that	1
though	1
God	1
should	1
shower	1
down	1
kingdoms	1
upon	1
earth,	1
not	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
would	1
fit	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
Mari	1
Gutierrez.	1
Let	1
me	1
tell	1
you,	1
señor,	1
she	1
is	1
not	1
worth	1
two	1
maravedis	1
for	1
a	1
queen;	1
countess	1
will	1
fit	1
her	1
better,	1
and	1
that	1
only	1
with	1
God’s	1
help.”	1
“Leave	1
it	1
to	1
God,	1
Sancho,”	1
returned	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“for	1
he	1
will	1
give	1
her	1
what	1
suits	1
her	1
best;	1
but	1
do	1
not	1
undervalue	1
thyself	1
so	1
much	1
as	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
be	1
content	1
with	1
anything	1
less	1
than	1
being	1
governor	1
of	1
a	1
province.”	1
“I	1
will	1
not,	1
señor,”	1
answered	1
Sancho,	1
“specially	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
such	1
quality	1
for	1
a	1
master	1
in	1
your	1
worship,	1
who	1
will	1
know	1
how	1
to	1
give	1
me	1
all	1
that	1
will	1
be	1
suitable	1
for	1
me	1
and	1
that	1
I	1
can	1
bear.”	1

At	1
this	1
point	1
they	1
came	1
in	1
sight	1
of	1
thirty	1
or	1
forty	1
windmills	1
that	1
there	1
are	1
on	1
that	1
plain,	1
and	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
saw	1
them	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
his	1
squire,	1
“Fortune	1
is	1
arranging	1
matters	1
for	1
us	1
better	1
than	1
we	1
could	1
have	1
shaped	1
our	1
desires	1
ourselves,	1
for	1
look	1
there,	1
friend	1
Sancho	1
Panza,	1
where	1
thirty	1
or	1
more	1
monstrous	1
giants	1
present	1
themselves,	1
all	1
of	1
whom	1
I	1
mean	1
to	1
engage	1
in	1
battle	1
and	1
slay,	1
and	1
with	1
whose	1
spoils	1
we	1
shall	1
begin	1
to	1
make	1
our	1
fortunes;	1
for	1
this	1
is	1
righteous	1
warfare,	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
God’s	1
good	1
service	1
to	1
sweep	1
so	1
evil	1
a	1
breed	1
from	1
off	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
earth.”	1
“What	1
giants?”	1
said	1
Sancho	1
Panza.	1
“Those	1
thou	1
seest	1
there,”	1
answered	1
his	1
master,	1
“with	1
the	1
long	1
arms,	1
and	1
some	1
have	1
them	1
nearly	1
two	1
leagues	1
long.”	1
“Look,	1
your	1
worship,”	1
said	1
Sancho;	1
“what	1
we	1
see	1
there	1
are	1
not	1
giants	1
but	1
windmills,	1
and	1
what	1
seem	1
to	1
be	1
their	1
arms	1
are	1
the	1
sails	1
that	1
turned	1
by	1
the	1
wind	1
make	1
the	1
millstone	1
go.”	1
“It	1
is	1
easy	1
to	1
see,”	1
replied	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“that	1
thou	1
art	1
not	1
used	1
to	1
this	1
business	1
of	1
adventures;	1
those	1
are	1
giants;	1
and	1
if	1
thou	1
art	1
afraid,	1
away	1
with	1
thee	1
out	1
of	1
this	1
and	1
betake	1
thyself	1
to	1
prayer	1
while	1
I	1
engage	1
them	1
in	1
fierce	1
and	1
unequal	1
combat.”	1
So	1
saying,	1
he	1
gave	1
the	1
spur	1
to	1
his	1
steed	1
Rocinante,	1
heedless	1
of	1
the	1
cries	1
his	1
squire	1
Sancho	1
sent	1
after	1
him,	1
warning	1
him	1
that	1
most	1
certainly	1
they	1
were	1
windmills	1
and	1
not	1
giants	1
he	1
was	1
going	1
to	1
attack.	1
He,	1
however,	1
was	1
so	1
positive	1
they	1
were	1
giants	1
that	1
he	1
neither	1
heard	1
the	1
cries	1
of	1
Sancho,	1
nor	1
perceived,	1
near	1
as	1
he	1
was,	1
what	1
they	1
were,	1
but	1
made	1
at	1
them	1
shouting,	1
“Fly	1
not,	1
cowards	1
and	1
vile	1
beings,	1
for	1
a	1
single	1
knight	1
attacks	1
you.”	1
A	1
slight	1
breeze	1
at	1
this	1
moment	1
sprang	1
up,	1
and	1
the	1
great	1
sails	1
began	1
to	1
move,	1
seeing	1
which	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
exclaimed,	1
“Though	1
ye	1
flourish	1
more	1
arms	1
than	1
the	1
giant	1
Briareus,	1
ye	1
have	1
to	1
reckon	1
with	1
me.”	1
So	1
saying,	1
and	1
commending	1
himself	1
with	1
all	1
his	1
heart	1
to	1
his	1
lady	1
Dulcinea,	1
imploring	1
her	1
to	1
support	1
him	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
peril,	1
with	1
lance	1
in	1
rest	1
and	1
covered	1
by	1
his	1
buckler,	1
he	1
charged	1
at	1
Rocinante’s	1
fullest	1
gallop	1
and	1
fell	1
upon	1
the	1
first	1
mill	1
that	1
stood	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
him;	1
but	1
as	1
he	1
drove	1
his	1
lance-point	1
into	1
the	1
sail	1
the	1
wind	1
whirled	1
it	1
round	1
with	1
such	1
force	1
that	1
it	1
shivered	1
the	1
lance	1
to	1
pieces,	1
sweeping	1
with	1
it	1
horse	1
and	1
rider,	1
who	1
went	1
rolling	1
over	1
on	1
the	1
plain,	1
in	1
a	1
sorry	1
condition.	1
Sancho	1
hastened	1
to	1
his	1
assistance	1
as	1
fast	1
as	1
his	1
ass	1
could	1
go,	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
came	1
up	1
found	1
him	1
unable	1
to	1
move,	1
with	1
such	1
a	1
shock	1
had	1
Rocinante	1
fallen	1
with	1
him.	1

“God	1
bless	1
me!”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“did	1
I	1
not	1
tell	1
your	1
worship	1
to	1
mind	1
what	1
you	1
were	1
about,	1
for	1
they	1
were	1
only	1
windmills?	1
and	1
no	1
one	1
could	1
have	1
made	1
any	1
mistake	1
about	1
it	1
but	1
one	1
who	1
had	1
something	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
kind	1
in	1
his	1
head.”	1
“Hush,	1
friend	1
Sancho,”	1
replied	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“the	1
fortunes	1
of	1
war	1
more	1
than	1
any	1
other	1
are	1
liable	1
to	1
frequent	1
fluctuations;	1
and	1
moreover	1
I	1
think,	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
truth,	1
that	1
that	1
same	1
sage	1
Friston	1
who	1
carried	1
off	1
my	1
study	1
and	1
books,	1
has	1
turned	1
these	1
giants	1
into	1
mills	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
rob	1
me	1
of	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
vanquishing	1
them,	1
such	1
is	1
the	1
enmity	1
he	1
bears	1
me;	1
but	1
in	1
the	1
end	1
his	1
wicked	1
arts	1
will	1
avail	1
but	1
little	1
against	1
my	1
good	1
sword.”	1

“God	1
order	1
it	1
as	1
he	1
may,”	1
said	1
Sancho	1
Panza,	1
and	1
helping	1
him	1
to	1
rise	1
got	1
him	1
up	1
again	1
on	1
Rocinante,	1
whose	1
shoulder	1
was	1
half	1
out;	1
and	1
then,	1
discussing	1
the	1
late	1
adventure,	1
they	1
followed	1
the	1
road	1
to	1
Puerto	1
Lapice,	1
for	1
there,	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
fail	1
to	1
find	1
adventures	1
in	1
abundance	1
and	1
variety,	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
great	1
thoroughfare.	1
For	1
all	1
that,	1
he	1
was	1
much	1
grieved	1
at	1
the	1
loss	1
of	1
his	1
lance,	1
and	1
saying	1
so	1
to	1
his	1
squire,	1
he	1
added,	1
“I	1
remember	1
having	1
read	1
how	1
a	1
Spanish	1
knight,	1
Diego	1
Perez	1
de	1
Vargas	1
by	1
name,	1
having	1
broken	1
his	1
sword	1
in	1
battle,	1
tore	1
from	1
an	1
oak	1
a	1
ponderous	1
bough	1
or	1
branch,	1
and	1
with	1
it	1
did	1
such	1
things	1
that	1
day,	1
and	1
pounded	1
so	1
many	1
Moors,	1
that	1
he	1
got	1
the	1
surname	1
of	1
Machuca,	1
and	1
he	1
and	1
his	1
descendants	1
from	1
that	1
day	1
forth	1
were	1
called	1
Vargas	1
y	1
Machuca.	1
I	1
mention	1
this	1
because	1
from	1
the	1
first	1
oak	1
I	1
see	1
I	1
mean	1
to	1
rend	1
such	1
another	1
branch,	1
large	1
and	1
stout	1
like	1
that,	1
with	1
which	1
I	1
am	1
determined	1
and	1
resolved	1
to	1
do	1
such	1
deeds	1
that	1
thou	1
mayest	1
deem	1
thyself	1
very	1
fortunate	1
in	1
being	1
found	1
worthy	1
to	1
come	1
and	1
see	1
them,	1
and	1
be	1
an	1
eyewitness	1
of	1
things	1
that	1
will	1
with	1
difficulty	1
be	1
believed.”	1
“Be	1
that	1
as	1
God	1
will,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“I	1
believe	1
it	1
all	1
as	1
your	1
worship	1
says	1
it;	1
but	1
straighten	1
yourself	1
a	1
little,	1
for	1
you	1
seem	1
all	1
on	1
one	1
side,	1
may	1
be	1
from	1
the	1
shaking	1
of	1
the	1
fall.”	1
“That	1
is	1
the	1
truth,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“and	1
if	1
I	1
make	1
no	1
complaint	1
of	1
the	1
pain	1
it	1
is	1
because	1
knights-errant	1
are	1
not	1
permitted	1
to	1
complain	1
of	1
any	1
wound,	1
even	1
though	1
their	1
bowels	1
be	1
coming	1
out	1
through	1
it.”	1
“If	1
so,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“I	1
have	1
nothing	1
to	1
say;	1
but	1
God	1
knows	1
I	1
would	1
rather	1
your	1
worship	1
complained	1
when	1
anything	1
ailed	1
you.	1
For	1
my	1
part,	1
I	1
confess	1
I	1
must	1
complain	1
however	1
small	1
the	1
ache	1
may	1
be;	1
unless	1
this	1
rule	1
about	1
not	1
complaining	1
extends	1
to	1
the	1
squires	1
of	1
knights-errant	1
also.”	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
laughing	1
at	1
his	1
squire’s	1
simplicity,	1
and	1
he	1
assured	1
him	1
he	1
might	1
complain	1
whenever	1
and	1
however	1
he	1
chose,	1
just	1
as	1
he	1
liked,	1
for,	1
so	1
far,	1
he	1
had	1
never	1
read	1
of	1
anything	1
to	1
the	1
contrary	1
in	1
the	1
order	1
of	1
knighthood.	1
Sancho	1
bade	1
him	1
remember	1
it	1
was	1
dinner-time,	1
to	1
which	1
his	1
master	1
answered	1
that	1
he	1
wanted	1
nothing	1
himself	1
just	1
then,	1
but	1
that	1
_he_	1
might	1
eat	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
a	1
mind.	1
With	1
this	1
permission	1
Sancho	1
settled	1
himself	1
as	1
comfortably	1
as	1
he	1
could	1
on	1
his	1
beast,	1
and	1
taking	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
alforjas	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
stowed	1
away	1
in	1
them,	1
he	1
jogged	1
along	1
behind	1
his	1
master	1
munching	1
deliberately,	1
and	1
from	1
time	1
to	1
time	1
taking	1
a	1
pull	1
at	1
the	1
bota	1
with	1
a	1
relish	1
that	1
the	1
thirstiest	1
tapster	1
in	1
Malaga	1
might	1
have	1
envied;	1
and	1
while	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
in	1
this	1
way,	1
gulping	1
down	1
draught	1
after	1
draught,	1
he	1
never	1
gave	1
a	1
thought	1
to	1
any	1
of	1
the	1
promises	1
his	1
master	1
had	1
made	1
him,	1
nor	1
did	1
he	1
rate	1
it	1
as	1
hardship	1
but	1
rather	1
as	1
recreation	1
going	1
in	1
quest	1
of	1
adventures,	1
however	1
dangerous	1
they	1
might	1
be.	1
Finally	1
they	1
passed	1
the	1
night	1
among	1
some	1
trees,	1
from	1
one	1
of	1
which	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
plucked	1
a	1
dry	1
branch	1
to	1
serve	1
him	1
after	1
a	1
fashion	1
as	1
a	1
lance,	1
and	1
fixed	1
on	1
it	1
the	1
head	1
he	1
had	1
removed	1
from	1
the	1
broken	1
one.	1
All	1
that	1
night	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
lay	1
awake	1
thinking	1
of	1
his	1
lady	1
Dulcinea,	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
conform	1
to	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
read	1
in	1
his	1
books,	1
how	1
many	1
a	1
night	1
in	1
the	1
forests	1
and	1
deserts	1
knights	1
used	1
to	1
lie	1
sleepless	1
supported	1
by	1
the	1
memory	1
of	1
their	1
mistresses.	1
Not	1
so	1
did	1
Sancho	1
Panza	1
spend	1
it,	1
for	1
having	1
his	1
stomach	1
full	1
of	1
something	1
stronger	1
than	1
chicory	1
water	1
he	1
made	1
but	1
one	1
sleep	1
of	1
it,	1
and,	1
if	1
his	1
master	1
had	1
not	1
called	1
him,	1
neither	1
the	1
rays	1
of	1
the	1
sun	1
beating	1
on	1
his	1
face	1
nor	1
all	1
the	1
cheery	1
notes	1
of	1
the	1
birds	1
welcoming	1
the	1
approach	1
of	1
day	1
would	1
have	1
had	1
power	1
to	1
waken	1
him.	1
On	1
getting	1
up	1
he	1
tried	1
the	1
bota	1
and	1
found	1
it	1
somewhat	1
less	1
full	1
than	1
the	1
night	1
before,	1
which	1
grieved	1
his	1
heart	1
because	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
seem	1
to	1
be	1
on	1
the	1
way	1
to	1
remedy	1
the	1
deficiency	1
readily.	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
did	1
not	1
care	1
to	1
break	1
his	1
fast,	1
for,	1
as	1
has	1
been	1
already	1
said,	1
he	1
confined	1
himself	1
to	1
savoury	1
recollections	1
for	1
nourishment.	1
They	1
returned	1
to	1
the	1
road	1
they	1
had	1
set	1
out	1
with,	1
leading	1
to	1
Puerto	1
Lapice,	1
and	1
at	1
three	1
in	1
the	1
afternoon	1
they	1
came	1
in	1
sight	1
of	1
it.	1
“Here,	1
brother	1
Sancho	1
Panza,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
it,	1
“we	1
may	1
plunge	1
our	1
hands	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
elbows	1
in	1
what	1
they	1
call	1
adventures;	1
but	1
observe,	1
even	1
shouldst	1
thou	1
see	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
greatest	1
danger	1
in	1
the	1
world,	1
thou	1
must	1
not	1
put	1
a	1
hand	1
to	1
thy	1
sword	1
in	1
my	1
defence,	1
unless	1
indeed	1
thou	1
perceivest	1
that	1
those	1
who	1
assail	1
me	1
are	1
rabble	1
or	1
base	1
folk;	1
for	1
in	1
that	1
case	1
thou	1
mayest	1
very	1
properly	1
aid	1
me;	1
but	1
if	1
they	1
be	1
knights	1
it	1
is	1
on	1
no	1
account	1
permitted	1
or	1
allowed	1
thee	1
by	1
the	1
laws	1
of	1
knighthood	1
to	1
help	1
me	1
until	1
thou	1
hast	1
been	1
dubbed	1
a	1
knight.”	1
“Most	1
certainly,	1
señor,”	1
replied	1
Sancho,	1
“your	1
worship	1
shall	1
be	1
fully	1
obeyed	1
in	1
this	1
matter;	1
all	1
the	1
more	1
as	1
of	1
myself	1
I	1
am	1
peaceful	1
and	1
no	1
friend	1
to	1
mixing	1
in	1
strife	1
and	1
quarrels:	1
it	1
is	1
true	1
that	1
as	1
regards	1
the	1
defence	1
of	1
my	1
own	1
person	1
I	1
shall	1
not	1
give	1
much	1
heed	1
to	1
those	1
laws,	1
for	1
laws	1
human	1
and	1
divine	1
allow	1
each	1
one	1
to	1
defend	1
himself	1
against	1
any	1
assailant	1
whatever.”	1
“That	1
I	1
grant,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“but	1
in	1
this	1
matter	1
of	1
aiding	1
me	1
against	1
knights	1
thou	1
must	1
put	1
a	1
restraint	1
upon	1
thy	1
natural	1
impetuosity.”	1
“I	1
will	1
do	1
so,	1
I	1
promise	1
you,”	1
answered	1
Sancho,	1
“and	1
will	1
keep	1
this	1
precept	1
as	1
carefully	1
as	1
Sunday.”	1
While	1
they	1
were	1
thus	1
talking	1
there	1
appeared	1
on	1
the	1
road	1
two	1
friars	1
of	1
the	1
order	1
of	1
St.	1
Benedict,	1
mounted	1
on	1
two	1
dromedaries,	1
for	1
not	1
less	1
tall	1
were	1
the	1
two	1
mules	1
they	1
rode	1
on.	1
They	1
wore	1
travelling	1
spectacles	1
and	1
carried	1
sunshades;	1
and	1
behind	1
them	1
came	1
a	1
coach	1
attended	1
by	1
four	1
or	1
five	1
persons	1
on	1
horseback	1
and	1
two	1
muleteers	1
on	1
foot.	1
In	1
the	1
coach	1
there	1
was,	1
as	1
afterwards	1
appeared,	1
a	1
Biscay	1
lady	1
on	1
her	1
way	1
to	1
Seville,	1
where	1
her	1
husband	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
take	1
passage	1
for	1
the	1
Indies	1
with	1
an	1
appointment	1
of	1
high	1
honour.	1
The	1
friars,	1
though	1
going	1
the	1
same	1
road,	1
were	1
not	1
in	1
her	1
company;	1
but	1
the	1
moment	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
perceived	1
them	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
his	1
squire,	1
“Either	1
I	1
am	1
mistaken,	1
or	1
this	1
is	1
going	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
most	1
famous	1
adventure	1
that	1
has	1
ever	1
been	1
seen,	1
for	1
those	1
black	1
bodies	1
we	1
see	1
there	1
must	1
be,	1
and	1
doubtless	1
are,	1
magicians	1
who	1
are	1
carrying	1
off	1
some	1
stolen	1
princess	1
in	1
that	1
coach,	1
and	1
with	1
all	1
my	1
might	1
I	1
must	1
undo	1
this	1
wrong.”	1
“This	1
will	1
be	1
worse	1
than	1
the	1
windmills,”	1
said	1
Sancho.	1
“Look,	1
señor;	1
those	1
are	1
friars	1
of	1
St.	1
Benedict,	1
and	1
the	1
coach	1
plainly	1
belongs	1
to	1
some	1
travellers:	1
I	1
tell	1
you	1
to	1
mind	1
well	1
what	1
you	1
are	1
about	1
and	1
don’t	1
let	1
the	1
devil	1
mislead	1
you.”	1
“I	1
have	1
told	1
thee	1
already,	1
Sancho,”	1
replied	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“that	1
on	1
the	1
subject	1
of	1
adventures	1
thou	1
knowest	1
little.	1
What	1
I	1
say	1
is	1
the	1
truth,	1
as	1
thou	1
shalt	1
see	1
presently.”	1
So	1
saying,	1
he	1
advanced	1
and	1
posted	1
himself	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
road	1
along	1
which	1
the	1
friars	1
were	1
coming,	1
and	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
thought	1
they	1
had	1
come	1
near	1
enough	1
to	1
hear	1
what	1
he	1
said,	1
he	1
cried	1
aloud,	1
“Devilish	1
and	1
unnatural	1
beings,	1
release	1
instantly	1
the	1
highborn	1
princesses	1
whom	1
you	1
are	1
carrying	1
off	1
by	1
force	1
in	1
this	1
coach,	1
else	1
prepare	1
to	1
meet	1
a	1
speedy	1
death	1
as	1
the	1
just	1
punishment	1
of	1
your	1
evil	1
deeds.”	1
The	1
friars	1
drew	1
rein	1
and	1
stood	1
wondering	1
at	1
the	1
appearance	1
of	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
at	1
his	1
words,	1
to	1
which	1
they	1
replied,	1
“Señor	1
Caballero,	1
we	1
are	1
not	1
devilish	1
or	1
unnatural,	1
but	1
two	1
brothers	1
of	1
St.	1
Benedict	1
following	1
our	1
road,	1
nor	1
do	1
we	1
know	1
whether	1
or	1
not	1
there	1
are	1
any	1
captive	1
princesses	1
coming	1
in	1
this	1
coach.”	1
“No	1
soft	1
words	1
with	1
me,	1
for	1
I	1
know	1
you,	1
lying	1
rabble,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
and	1
without	1
waiting	1
for	1
a	1
reply	1
he	1
spurred	1
Rocinante	1
and	1
with	1
levelled	1
lance	1
charged	1
the	1
first	1
friar	1
with	1
such	1
fury	1
and	1
determination,	1
that,	1
if	1
the	1
friar	1
had	1
not	1
flung	1
himself	1
off	1
the	1
mule,	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
brought	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
ground	1
against	1
his	1
will,	1
and	1
sore	1
wounded,	1
if	1
not	1
killed	1
outright.	1
The	1
second	1
brother,	1
seeing	1
how	1
his	1
comrade	1
was	1
treated,	1
drove	1
his	1
heels	1
into	1
his	1
castle	1
of	1
a	1
mule	1
and	1
made	1
off	1
across	1
the	1
country	1
faster	1
than	1
the	1
wind.	1
Sancho	1
Panza,	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
the	1
friar	1
on	1
the	1
ground,	1
dismounting	1
briskly	1
from	1
his	1
ass,	1
rushed	1
towards	1
him	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
strip	1
off	1
his	1
gown.	1
At	1
that	1
instant	1
the	1
friars	1
muleteers	1
came	1
up	1
and	1
asked	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
stripping	1
him	1
for.	1
Sancho	1
answered	1
them	1
that	1
this	1
fell	1
to	1
him	1
lawfully	1
as	1
spoil	1
of	1
the	1
battle	1
which	1
his	1
lord	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
had	1
won.	1
The	1
muleteers,	1
who	1
had	1
no	1
idea	1
of	1
a	1
joke	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
understand	1
all	1
this	1
about	1
battles	1
and	1
spoils,	1
seeing	1
that	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
was	1
some	1
distance	1
off	1
talking	1
to	1
the	1
travellers	1
in	1
the	1
coach,	1
fell	1
upon	1
Sancho,	1
knocked	1
him	1
down,	1
and	1
leaving	1
hardly	1
a	1
hair	1
in	1
his	1
beard,	1
belaboured	1
him	1
with	1
kicks	1
and	1
left	1
him	1
stretched	1
breathless	1
and	1
senseless	1
on	1
the	1
ground;	1
and	1
without	1
any	1
more	1
delay	1
helped	1
the	1
friar	1
to	1
mount,	1
who,	1
trembling,	1
terrified,	1
and	1
pale,	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
found	1
himself	1
in	1
the	1
saddle,	1
spurred	1
after	1
his	1
companion,	1
who	1
was	1
standing	1
at	1
a	1
distance	1
looking	1
on,	1
watching	1
the	1
result	1
of	1
the	1
onslaught;	1
then,	1
not	1
caring	1
to	1
wait	1
for	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
affair	1
just	1
begun,	1
they	1
pursued	1
their	1
journey	1
making	1
more	1
crosses	1
than	1
if	1
they	1
had	1
the	1
devil	1
after	1
them.	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
was,	1
as	1
has	1
been	1
said,	1
speaking	1
to	1
the	1
lady	1
in	1
the	1
coach:	1
“Your	1
beauty,	1
lady	1
mine,”	1
said	1
he,	1
“may	1
now	1
dispose	1
of	1
your	1
person	1
as	1
may	1
be	1
most	1
in	1
accordance	1
with	1
your	1
pleasure,	1
for	1
the	1
pride	1
of	1
your	1
ravishers	1
lies	1
prostrate	1
on	1
the	1
ground	1
through	1
this	1
strong	1
arm	1
of	1
mine;	1
and	1
lest	1
you	1
should	1
be	1
pining	1
to	1
know	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
your	1
deliverer,	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
called	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
of	1
La	1
Mancha,	1
knight-errant	1
and	1
adventurer,	1
and	1
captive	1
to	1
the	1
peerless	1
and	1
beautiful	1
lady	1
Dulcinea	1
del	1
Toboso:	1
and	1
in	1
return	1
for	1
the	1
service	1
you	1
have	1
received	1
of	1
me	1
I	1
ask	1
no	1
more	1
than	1
that	1
you	1
should	1
return	1
to	1
El	1
Toboso,	1
and	1
on	1
my	1
behalf	1
present	1
yourself	1
before	1
that	1
lady	1
and	1
tell	1
her	1
what	1
I	1
have	1
done	1
to	1
set	1
you	1
free.”	1
One	1
of	1
the	1
squires	1
in	1
attendance	1
upon	1
the	1
coach,	1
a	1
Biscayan,	1
was	1
listening	1
to	1
all	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
was	1
saying,	1
and,	1
perceiving	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
allow	1
the	1
coach	1
to	1
go	1
on,	1
but	1
was	1
saying	1
it	1
must	1
return	1
at	1
once	1
to	1
El	1
Toboso,	1
he	1
made	1
at	1
him,	1
and	1
seizing	1
his	1
lance	1
addressed	1
him	1
in	1
bad	1
Castilian	1
and	1
worse	1
Biscayan	1
after	1
his	1
fashion,	1
“Begone,	1
caballero,	1
and	1
ill	1
go	1
with	1
thee;	1
by	1
the	1
God	1
that	1
made	1
me,	1
unless	1
thou	1
quittest	1
coach,	1
slayest	1
thee	1
as	1
art	1
here	1
a	1
Biscayan.”	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
understood	1
him	1
quite	1
well,	1
and	1
answered	1
him	1
very	1
quietly,	1
“If	1
thou	1
wert	1
a	1
knight,	1
as	1
thou	1
art	1
none,	1
I	1
should	1
have	1
already	1
chastised	1
thy	1
folly	1
and	1
rashness,	1
miserable	1
creature.”	1
To	1
which	1
the	1
Biscayan	1
returned,	1
“I	1
no	1
gentleman!—I	1
swear	1
to	1
God	1
thou	1
liest	1
as	1
I	1
am	1
Christian:	1
if	1
thou	1
droppest	1
lance	1
and	1
drawest	1
sword,	1
soon	1
shalt	1
thou	1
see	1
thou	1
art	1
carrying	1
water	1
to	1
the	1
cat:	1
Biscayan	1
on	1
land,	1
hidalgo	1
at	1
sea,	1
hidalgo	1
at	1
the	1
devil,	1
and	1
look,	1
if	1
thou	1
sayest	1
otherwise	1
thou	1
liest.”	1
“‘“You	1
will	1
see	1
presently,”	1
said	1
Agrajes,’”	1
replied	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
and	1
throwing	1
his	1
lance	1
on	1
the	1
ground	1
he	1
drew	1
his	1
sword,	1
braced	1
his	1
buckler	1
on	1
his	1
arm,	1
and	1
attacked	1
the	1
Biscayan,	1
bent	1
upon	1
taking	1
his	1
life.	1
The	1
Biscayan,	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
him	1
coming	1
on,	1
though	1
he	1
wished	1
to	1
dismount	1
from	1
his	1
mule,	1
in	1
which,	1
being	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
sorry	1
ones	1
let	1
out	1
for	1
hire,	1
he	1
had	1
no	1
confidence,	1
had	1
no	1
choice	1
but	1
to	1
draw	1
his	1
sword;	1
it	1
was	1
lucky	1
for	1
him,	1
however,	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
near	1
the	1
coach,	1
from	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
able	1
to	1
snatch	1
a	1
cushion	1
that	1
served	1
him	1
for	1
a	1
shield;	1
and	1
they	1
went	1
at	1
one	1
another	1
as	1
if	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
two	1
mortal	1
enemies.	1
The	1
others	1
strove	1
to	1
make	1
peace	1
between	1
them,	1
but	1
could	1
not,	1
for	1
the	1
Biscayan	1
declared	1
in	1
his	1
disjointed	1
phrase	1
that	1
if	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
let	1
him	1
finish	1
his	1
battle	1
he	1
would	1
kill	1
his	1
mistress	1
and	1
everyone	1
that	1
strove	1
to	1
prevent	1
him.	1
The	1
lady	1
in	1
the	1
coach,	1
amazed	1
and	1
terrified	1
at	1
what	1
she	1
saw,	1
ordered	1
the	1
coachman	1
to	1
draw	1
aside	1
a	1
little,	1
and	1
set	1
herself	1
to	1
watch	1
this	1
severe	1
struggle,	1
in	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
which	1
the	1
Biscayan	1
smote	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
a	1
mighty	1
stroke	1
on	1
the	1
shoulder	1
over	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
his	1
buckler,	1
which,	1
given	1
to	1
one	1
without	1
armour,	1
would	1
have	1
cleft	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
waist.	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
feeling	1
the	1
weight	1
of	1
this	1
prodigious	1
blow,	1
cried	1
aloud,	1
saying,	1
“O	1
lady	1
of	1
my	1
soul,	1
Dulcinea,	1
flower	1
of	1
beauty,	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
aid	1
of	1
this	1
your	1
knight,	1
who,	1
in	1
fulfilling	1
his	1
obligations	1
to	1
your	1
beauty,	1
finds	1
himself	1
in	1
this	1
extreme	1
peril.”	1
To	1
say	1
this,	1
to	1
lift	1
his	1
sword,	1
to	1
shelter	1
himself	1
well	1
behind	1
his	1
buckler,	1
and	1
to	1
assail	1
the	1
Biscayan	1
was	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
an	1
instant,	1
determined	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
to	1
venture	1
all	1
upon	1
a	1
single	1
blow.	1
The	1
Biscayan,	1
seeing	1
him	1
come	1
on	1
in	1
this	1
way,	1
was	1
convinced	1
of	1
his	1
courage	1
by	1
his	1
spirited	1
bearing,	1
and	1
resolved	1
to	1
follow	1
his	1
example,	1
so	1
he	1
waited	1
for	1
him	1
keeping	1
well	1
under	1
cover	1
of	1
his	1
cushion,	1
being	1
unable	1
to	1
execute	1
any	1
sort	1
of	1
manoeuvre	1
with	1
his	1
mule,	1
which,	1
dead	1
tired	1
and	1
never	1
meant	1
for	1
this	1
kind	1
of	1
game,	1
could	1
not	1
stir	1
a	1
step.	1
On,	1
then,	1
as	1
aforesaid,	1
came	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
against	1
the	1
wary	1
Biscayan,	1
with	1
uplifted	1
sword	1
and	1
a	1
firm	1
intention	1
of	1
splitting	1
him	1
in	1
half,	1
while	1
on	1
his	1
side	1
the	1
Biscayan	1
waited	1
for	1
him	1
sword	1
in	1
hand,	1
and	1
under	1
the	1
protection	1
of	1
his	1
cushion;	1
and	1
all	1
present	1
stood	1
trembling,	1
waiting	1
in	1
suspense	1
the	1
result	1
of	1
blows	1
such	1
as	1
threatened	1
to	1
fall,	1
and	1
the	1
lady	1
in	1
the	1
coach	1
and	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
her	1
following	1
were	1
making	1
a	1
thousand	1
vows	1
and	1
offerings	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
images	1
and	1
shrines	1
of	1
Spain,	1
that	1
God	1
might	1
deliver	1
her	1
squire	1
and	1
all	1
of	1
them	1
from	1
this	1
great	1
peril	1
in	1
which	1
they	1
found	1
themselves.	1
But	1
it	1
spoils	1
all,	1
that	1
at	1
this	1
point	1
and	1
crisis	1
the	1
author	1
of	1
the	1
history	1
leaves	1
this	1
battle	1
impending,	1
giving	1
as	1
excuse	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
find	1
nothing	1
more	1
written	1
about	1
these	1
achievements	1
of	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
than	1
what	1
has	1
been	1
already	1
set	1
forth.	1
It	1
is	1
true	1
the	1
second	1
author	1
of	1
this	1
work	1
was	1
unwilling	1
to	1
believe	1
that	1
a	1
history	1
so	1
curious	1
could	1
have	1
been	1
allowed	1
to	1
fall	1
under	1
the	1
sentence	1
of	1
oblivion,	1
or	1
that	1
the	1
wits	1
of	1
La	1
Mancha	1
could	1
have	1
been	1
so	1
undiscerning	1
as	1
not	1
to	1
preserve	1
in	1
their	1
archives	1
or	1
registries	1
some	1
documents	1
referring	1
to	1
this	1
famous	1
knight;	1
and	1
this	1
being	1
his	1
persuasion,	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
despair	1
of	1
finding	1
the	1
conclusion	1
of	1
this	1
pleasant	1
history,	1
which,	1
heaven	1
favouring	1
him,	1
he	1
did	1
find	1
in	1
a	1
way	1
that	1
shall	1
be	1
related	1
in	1
the	1
Second	1
Part.	1

In	1
the	1
First	1
Part	1
of	1
this	1
history	1
we	1
left	1
the	1
valiant	1
Biscayan	1
and	1
the	1
renowned	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
with	1
drawn	1
swords	1
uplifted,	1
ready	1
to	1
deliver	1
two	1
such	1
furious	1
slashing	1
blows	1
that	1
if	1
they	1
had	1
fallen	1
full	1
and	1
fair	1
they	1
would	1
at	1
least	1
have	1
split	1
and	1
cleft	1
them	1
asunder	1
from	1
top	1
to	1
toe	1
and	1
laid	1
them	1
open	1
like	1
a	1
pomegranate;	1
and	1
at	1
this	1
so	1
critical	1
point	1
the	1
delightful	1
history	1
came	1
to	1
a	1
stop	1
and	1
stood	1
cut	1
short	1
without	1
any	1
intimation	1
from	1
the	1
author	1
where	1
what	1
was	1
missing	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
found.	1
This	1
distressed	1
me	1
greatly,	1
because	1
the	1
pleasure	1
derived	1
from	1
having	1
read	1
such	1
a	1
small	1
portion	1
turned	1
to	1
vexation	1
at	1
the	1
thought	1
of	1
the	1
poor	1
chance	1
that	1
presented	1
itself	1
of	1
finding	1
the	1
large	1
part	1
that,	1
so	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
me,	1
was	1
missing	1
of	1
such	1
an	1
interesting	1
tale.	1
It	1
appeared	1
to	1
me	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
thing	1
impossible	1
and	1
contrary	1
to	1
all	1
precedent	1
that	1
so	1
good	1
a	1
knight	1
should	1
have	1
been	1
without	1
some	1
sage	1
to	1
undertake	1
the	1
task	1
of	1
writing	1
his	1
marvellous	1
achievements;	1
a	1
thing	1
that	1
was	1
never	1
wanting	1
to	1
any	1
of	1
those	1
knights-errant	1
who,	1
they	1
say,	1
went	1
after	1
adventures;	1
for	1
every	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
had	1
one	1
or	1
two	1
sages	1
as	1
if	1
made	1
on	1
purpose,	1
who	1
not	1
only	1
recorded	1
their	1
deeds	1
but	1
described	1
their	1
most	1
trifling	1
thoughts	1
and	1
follies,	1
however	1
secret	1
they	1
might	1
be;	1
and	1
such	1
a	1
good	1
knight	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
been	1
so	1
unfortunate	1
as	1
not	1
to	1
have	1
what	1
Platir	1
and	1
others	1
like	1
him	1
had	1
in	1
abundance.	1
And	1
so	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
bring	1
myself	1
to	1
believe	1
that	1
such	1
a	1
gallant	1
tale	1
had	1
been	1
left	1
maimed	1
and	1
mutilated,	1
and	1
I	1
laid	1
the	1
blame	1
on	1
Time,	1
the	1
devourer	1
and	1
destroyer	1
of	1
all	1
things,	1
that	1
had	1
either	1
concealed	1
or	1
consumed	1
it.	1
On	1
the	1
other	1
hand,	1
it	1
struck	1
me	1
that,	1
inasmuch	1
as	1
among	1
his	1
books	1
there	1
had	1
been	1
found	1
such	1
modern	1
ones	1
as	1
“The	1
Enlightenment	1
of	1
Jealousy”	1
and	1
the	1
“Nymphs	1
and	1
Shepherds	1
of	1
Henares,”	1
his	1
story	1
must	1
likewise	1
be	1
modern,	1
and	1
that	1
though	1
it	1
might	1
not	1
be	1
written,	1
it	1
might	1
exist	1
in	1
the	1
memory	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
his	1
village	1
and	1
of	1
those	1
in	1
the	1
neighbourhood.	1
This	1
reflection	1
kept	1
me	1
perplexed	1
and	1
longing	1
to	1
know	1
really	1
and	1
truly	1
the	1
whole	1
life	1
and	1
wondrous	1
deeds	1
of	1
our	1
famous	1
Spaniard,	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
of	1
La	1
Mancha,	1
light	1
and	1
mirror	1
of	1
Manchegan	1
chivalry,	1
and	1
the	1
first	1
that	1
in	1
our	1
age	1
and	1
in	1
these	1
so	1
evil	1
days	1
devoted	1
himself	1
to	1
the	1
labour	1
and	1
exercise	1
of	1
the	1
arms	1
of	1
knight-errantry,	1
righting	1
wrongs,	1
succouring	1
widows,	1
and	1
protecting	1
damsels	1
of	1
that	1
sort	1
that	1
used	1
to	1
ride	1
about,	1
whip	1
in	1
hand,	1
on	1
their	1
palfreys,	1
with	1
all	1
their	1
virginity	1
about	1
them,	1
from	1
mountain	1
to	1
mountain	1
and	1
valley	1
to	1
valley—for,	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
not	1
for	1
some	1
ruffian,	1
or	1
boor	1
with	1
a	1
hood	1
and	1
hatchet,	1
or	1
monstrous	1
giant,	1
that	1
forced	1
them,	1
there	1
were	1
in	1
days	1
of	1
yore	1
damsels	1
that	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
eighty	1
years,	1
in	1
all	1
which	1
time	1
they	1
had	1
never	1
slept	1
a	1
day	1
under	1
a	1
roof,	1
went	1
to	1
their	1
graves	1
as	1
much	1
maids	1
as	1
the	1
mothers	1
that	1
bore	1
them.	1
I	1
say,	1
then,	1
that	1
in	1
these	1
and	1
other	1
respects	1
our	1
gallant	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
is	1
worthy	1
of	1
everlasting	1
and	1
notable	1
praise,	1
nor	1
should	1
it	1
be	1
withheld	1
even	1
from	1
me	1
for	1
the	1
labour	1
and	1
pains	1
spent	1
in	1
searching	1
for	1
the	1
conclusion	1
of	1
this	1
delightful	1
history;	1
though	1
I	1
know	1
well	1
that	1
if	1
Heaven,	1
chance	1
and	1
good	1
fortune	1
had	1
not	1
helped	1
me,	1
the	1
world	1
would	1
have	1
remained	1
deprived	1
of	1
an	1
entertainment	1
and	1
pleasure	1
that	1
for	1
a	1
couple	1
of	1
hours	1
or	1
so	1
may	1
well	1
occupy	1
him	1
who	1
shall	1
read	1
it	1
attentively.	1
The	1
discovery	1
of	1
it	1
occurred	1
in	1
this	1
way.	1
One	1
day,	1
as	1
I	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
Alcana	1
of	1
Toledo,	1
a	1
boy	1
came	1
up	1
to	1
sell	1
some	1
pamphlets	1
and	1
old	1
papers	1
to	1
a	1
silk	1
mercer,	1
and,	1
as	1
I	1
am	1
fond	1
of	1
reading	1
even	1
the	1
very	1
scraps	1
of	1
paper	1
in	1
the	1
streets,	1
led	1
by	1
this	1
natural	1
bent	1
of	1
mine	1
I	1
took	1
up	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
pamphlets	1
the	1
boy	1
had	1
for	1
sale,	1
and	1
saw	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
in	1
characters	1
which	1
I	1
recognised	1
as	1
Arabic,	1
and	1
as	1
I	1
was	1
unable	1
to	1
read	1
them	1
though	1
I	1
could	1
recognise	1
them,	1
I	1
looked	1
about	1
to	1
see	1
if	1
there	1
were	1
any	1
Spanish-speaking	1
Morisco	1
at	1
hand	1
to	1
read	1
them	1
for	1
me;	1
nor	1
was	1
there	1
any	1
great	1
difficulty	1
in	1
finding	1
such	1
an	1
interpreter,	1
for	1
even	1
had	1
I	1
sought	1
one	1
for	1
an	1
older	1
and	1
better	1
language	1
I	1
should	1
have	1
found	1
him.	1
In	1
short,	1
chance	1
provided	1
me	1
with	1
one,	1
who	1
when	1
I	1
told	1
him	1
what	1
I	1
wanted	1
and	1
put	1
the	1
book	1
into	1
his	1
hands,	1
opened	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
and	1
after	1
reading	1
a	1
little	1
in	1
it	1
began	1
to	1
laugh.	1
I	1
asked	1
him	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
laughing	1
at,	1
and	1
he	1
replied	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
at	1
something	1
the	1
book	1
had	1
written	1
in	1
the	1
margin	1
by	1
way	1
of	1
a	1
note.	1
I	1
bade	1
him	1
tell	1
it	1
to	1
me;	1
and	1
he	1
still	1
laughing	1
said,	1
“In	1
the	1
margin,	1
as	1
I	1
told	1
you,	1
this	1
is	1
written:	1
‘_This	1
Dulcinea	1
del	1
Toboso	1
so	1
often	1
mentioned	1
in	1
this	1
history,	1
had,	1
they	1
say,	1
the	1
best	1
hand	1
of	1
any	1
woman	1
in	1
all	1
La	1
Mancha	1
for	1
salting	1
pigs_.’”	1
When	1
I	1
heard	1
Dulcinea	1
del	1
Toboso	1
named,	1
I	1
was	1
struck	1
with	1
surprise	1
and	1
amazement,	1
for	1
it	1
occurred	1
to	1
me	1
at	1
once	1
that	1
these	1
pamphlets	1
contained	1
the	1
history	1
of	1
Don	1
Quixote.	1
With	1
this	1
idea	1
I	1
pressed	1
him	1
to	1
read	1
the	1
beginning,	1
and	1
doing	1
so,	1
turning	1
the	1
Arabic	1
offhand	1
into	1
Castilian,	1
he	1
told	1
me	1
it	1
meant,	1
“_History	1
of	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
of	1
La	1
Mancha,	1
written	1
by	1
Cid	1
Hamete	1
Benengeli,	1
an	1
Arab	1
historian_.”	1
It	1
required	1
great	1
caution	1
to	1
hide	1
the	1
joy	1
I	1
felt	1
when	1
the	1
title	1
of	1
the	1
book	1
reached	1
my	1
ears,	1
and	1
snatching	1
it	1
from	1
the	1
silk	1
mercer,	1
I	1
bought	1
all	1
the	1
papers	1
and	1
pamphlets	1
from	1
the	1
boy	1
for	1
half	1
a	1
real;	1
and	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
had	1
his	1
wits	1
about	1
him	1
and	1
had	1
known	1
how	1
eager	1
I	1
was	1
for	1
them,	1
he	1
might	1
have	1
safely	1
calculated	1
on	1
making	1
more	1
than	1
six	1
reals	1
by	1
the	1
bargain.	1
I	1
withdrew	1
at	1
once	1
with	1
the	1
Morisco	1
into	1
the	1
cloister	1
of	1
the	1
cathedral,	1
and	1
begged	1
him	1
to	1
turn	1
all	1
these	1
pamphlets	1
that	1
related	1
to	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
into	1
the	1
Castilian	1
tongue,	1
without	1
omitting	1
or	1
adding	1
anything	1
to	1
them,	1
offering	1
him	1
whatever	1
payment	1
he	1
pleased.	1
He	1
was	1
satisfied	1
with	1
two	1
arrobas	1
of	1
raisins	1
and	1
two	1
bushels	1
of	1
wheat,	1
and	1
promised	1
to	1
translate	1
them	1
faithfully	1
and	1
with	1
all	1
despatch;	1
but	1
to	1
make	1
the	1
matter	1
easier,	1
and	1
not	1
to	1
let	1
such	1
a	1
precious	1
find	1
out	1
of	1
my	1
hands,	1
I	1
took	1
him	1
to	1
my	1
house,	1
where	1
in	1
little	1
more	1
than	1
a	1
month	1
and	1
a	1
half	1
he	1
translated	1
the	1
whole	1
just	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
set	1
down	1
here.	1
In	1
the	1
first	1
pamphlet	1
the	1
battle	1
between	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
and	1
the	1
Biscayan	1
was	1
drawn	1
to	1
the	1
very	1
life,	1
they	1
planted	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
attitude	1
as	1
the	1
history	1
describes,	1
their	1
swords	1
raised,	1
and	1
the	1
one	1
protected	1
by	1
his	1
buckler,	1
the	1
other	1
by	1
his	1
cushion,	1
and	1
the	1
Biscayan’s	1
mule	1
so	1
true	1
to	1
nature	1
that	1
it	1
could	1
be	1
seen	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
hired	1
one	1
a	1
bowshot	1
off.	1
The	1
Biscayan	1
had	1
an	1
inscription	1
under	1
his	1
feet	1
which	1
said,	1
“_Don	1
Sancho	1
de	1
Azpeitia_,”	1
which	1
no	1
doubt	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
his	1
name;	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
feet	1
of	1
Rocinante	1
was	1
another	1
that	1
said,	1
“_Don	1
Quixote_.”	1
Rocinante	1
was	1
marvellously	1
portrayed,	1
so	1
long	1
and	1
thin,	1
so	1
lank	1
and	1
lean,	1
with	1
so	1
much	1
backbone	1
and	1
so	1
far	1
gone	1
in	1
consumption,	1
that	1
he	1
showed	1
plainly	1
with	1
what	1
judgment	1
and	1
propriety	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Rocinante	1
had	1
been	1
bestowed	1
upon	1
him.	1
Near	1
him	1
was	1
Sancho	1
Panza	1
holding	1
the	1
halter	1
of	1
his	1
ass,	1
at	1
whose	1
feet	1
was	1
another	1
label	1
that	1
said,	1
“Sancho	1
Zancas,”	1
and	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
picture,	1
he	1
must	1
have	1
had	1
a	1
big	1
belly,	1
a	1
short	1
body,	1
and	1
long	1
shanks,	1
for	1
which	1
reason,	1
no	1
doubt,	1
the	1
names	1
of	1
Panza	1
and	1
Zancas	1
were	1
given	1
him,	1
for	1
by	1
these	1
two	1
surnames	1
the	1
history	1
several	1
times	1
calls	1
him.	1
Some	1
other	1
trifling	1
particulars	1
might	1
be	1
mentioned,	1
but	1
they	1
are	1
all	1
of	1
slight	1
importance	1
and	1
have	1
nothing	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
the	1
true	1
relation	1
of	1
the	1
history;	1
and	1
no	1
history	1
can	1
be	1
bad	1
so	1
long	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
true.	1
If	1
against	1
the	1
present	1
one	1
any	1
objection	1
be	1
raised	1
on	1
the	1
score	1
of	1
its	1
truth,	1
it	1
can	1
only	1
be	1
that	1
its	1
author	1
was	1
an	1
Arab,	1
as	1
lying	1
is	1
a	1
very	1
common	1
propensity	1
with	1
those	1
of	1
that	1
nation;	1
though,	1
as	1
they	1
are	1
such	1
enemies	1
of	1
ours,	1
it	1
is	1
conceivable	1
that	1
there	1
were	1
omissions	1
rather	1
than	1
additions	1
made	1
in	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
it.	1
And	1
this	1
is	1
my	1
own	1
opinion;	1
for,	1
where	1
he	1
could	1
and	1
should	1
give	1
freedom	1
to	1
his	1
pen	1
in	1
praise	1
of	1
so	1
worthy	1
a	1
knight,	1
he	1
seems	1
to	1
me	1
deliberately	1
to	1
pass	1
it	1
over	1
in	1
silence;	1
which	1
is	1
ill	1
done	1
and	1
worse	1
contrived,	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
business	1
and	1
duty	1
of	1
historians	1
to	1
be	1
exact,	1
truthful,	1
and	1
wholly	1
free	1
from	1
passion,	1
and	1
neither	1
interest	1
nor	1
fear,	1
hatred	1
nor	1
love,	1
should	1
make	1
them	1
swerve	1
from	1
the	1
path	1
of	1
truth,	1
whose	1
mother	1
is	1
history,	1
rival	1
of	1
time,	1
storehouse	1
of	1
deeds,	1
witness	1
for	1
the	1
past,	1
example	1
and	1
counsel	1
for	1
the	1
present,	1
and	1
warning	1
for	1
the	1
future.	1
In	1
this	1
I	1
know	1
will	1
be	1
found	1
all	1
that	1
can	1
be	1
desired	1
in	1
the	1
pleasantest,	1
and	1
if	1
it	1
be	1
wanting	1
in	1
any	1
good	1
quality,	1
I	1
maintain	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
fault	1
of	1
its	1
hound	1
of	1
an	1
author	1
and	1
not	1
the	1
fault	1
of	1
the	1
subject.	1
To	1
be	1
brief,	1
its	1
Second	1
Part,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
translation,	1
began	1
in	1
this	1
way:	1
With	1
trenchant	1
swords	1
upraised	1
and	1
poised	1
on	1
high,	1
it	1
seemed	1
as	1
though	1
the	1
two	1
valiant	1
and	1
wrathful	1
combatants	1
stood	1
threatening	1
heaven,	1
and	1
earth,	1
and	1
hell,	1
with	1
such	1
resolution	1
and	1
determination	1
did	1
they	1
bear	1
themselves.	1
The	1
fiery	1
Biscayan	1
was	1
the	1
first	1
to	1
strike	1
a	1
blow,	1
which	1
was	1
delivered	1
with	1
such	1
force	1
and	1
fury	1
that	1
had	1
not	1
the	1
sword	1
turned	1
in	1
its	1
course,	1
that	1
single	1
stroke	1
would	1
have	1
sufficed	1
to	1
put	1
an	1
end	1
to	1
the	1
bitter	1
struggle	1
and	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
adventures	1
of	1
our	1
knight;	1
but	1
that	1
good	1
fortune	1
which	1
reserved	1
him	1
for	1
greater	1
things,	1
turned	1
aside	1
the	1
sword	1
of	1
his	1
adversary,	1
so	1
that	1
although	1
it	1
smote	1
him	1
upon	1
the	1
left	1
shoulder,	1
it	1
did	1
him	1
no	1
more	1
harm	1
than	1
to	1
strip	1
all	1
that	1
side	1
of	1
its	1
armour,	1
carrying	1
away	1
a	1
great	1
part	1
of	1
his	1
helmet	1
with	1
half	1
of	1
his	1
ear,	1
all	1
which	1
with	1
fearful	1
ruin	1
fell	1
to	1
the	1
ground,	1
leaving	1
him	1
in	1
a	1
sorry	1
plight.	1
Good	1
God!	1
Who	1
is	1
there	1
that	1
could	1
properly	1
describe	1
the	1
rage	1
that	1
filled	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
our	1
Manchegan	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
himself	1
dealt	1
with	1
in	1
this	1
fashion?	1
All	1
that	1
can	1
be	1
said	1
is,	1
it	1
was	1
such	1
that	1
he	1
again	1
raised	1
himself	1
in	1
his	1
stirrups,	1
and,	1
grasping	1
his	1
sword	1
more	1
firmly	1
with	1
both	1
hands,	1
he	1
came	1
down	1
on	1
the	1
Biscayan	1
with	1
such	1
fury,	1
smiting	1
him	1
full	1
over	1
the	1
cushion	1
and	1
over	1
the	1
head,	1
that—even	1
so	1
good	1
a	1
shield	1
proving	1
useless—as	1
if	1
a	1
mountain	1
had	1
fallen	1
on	1
him,	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
bleed	1
from	1
nose,	1
mouth,	1
and	1
ears,	1
reeling	1
as	1
if	1
about	1
to	1
fall	1
backwards	1
from	1
his	1
mule,	1
as	1
no	1
doubt	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
done	1
had	1
he	1
not	1
flung	1
his	1
arms	1
about	1
its	1
neck;	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time,	1
however,	1
he	1
slipped	1
his	1
feet	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
stirrups	1
and	1
then	1
unclasped	1
his	1
arms,	1
and	1
the	1
mule,	1
taking	1
fright	1
at	1
the	1
terrible	1
blow,	1
made	1
off	1
across	1
the	1
plain,	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
few	1
plunges	1
flung	1
its	1
master	1
to	1
the	1
ground.	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
stood	1
looking	1
on	1
very	1
calmly,	1
and,	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
him	1
fall,	1
leaped	1
from	1
his	1
horse	1
and	1
with	1
great	1
briskness	1
ran	1
to	1
him,	1
and,	1
presenting	1
the	1
point	1
of	1
his	1
sword	1
to	1
his	1
eyes,	1
bade	1
him	1
surrender,	1
or	1
he	1
would	1
cut	1
his	1
head	1
off.	1
The	1
Biscayan	1
was	1
so	1
bewildered	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
unable	1
to	1
answer	1
a	1
word,	1
and	1
it	1
would	1
have	1
gone	1
hard	1
with	1
him,	1
so	1
blind	1
was	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
had	1
not	1
the	1
ladies	1
in	1
the	1
coach,	1
who	1
had	1
hitherto	1
been	1
watching	1
the	1
combat	1
in	1
great	1
terror,	1
hastened	1
to	1
where	1
he	1
stood	1
and	1
implored	1
him	1
with	1
earnest	1
entreaties	1
to	1
grant	1
them	1
the	1
great	1
grace	1
and	1
favour	1
of	1
sparing	1
their	1
squire’s	1
life;	1
to	1
which	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
replied	1
with	1
much	1
gravity	1
and	1
dignity,	1
“In	1
truth,	1
fair	1
ladies,	1
I	1
am	1
well	1
content	1
to	1
do	1
what	1
ye	1
ask	1
of	1
me;	1
but	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
on	1
one	1
condition	1
and	1
understanding,	1
which	1
is	1
that	1
this	1
knight	1
promise	1
me	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
village	1
of	1
El	1
Toboso,	1
and	1
on	1
my	1
behalf	1
present	1
himself	1
before	1
the	1
peerless	1
lady	1
Dulcinea,	1
that	1
she	1
deal	1
with	1
him	1
as	1
shall	1
be	1
most	1
pleasing	1
to	1
her.”	1
The	1
terrified	1
and	1
disconsolate	1
ladies,	1
without	1
discussing	1
Don	1
Quixote’s	1
demand	1
or	1
asking	1
who	1
Dulcinea	1
might	1
be,	1
promised	1
that	1
their	1
squire	1
should	1
do	1
all	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
commanded.	1
“Then,	1
on	1
the	1
faith	1
of	1
that	1
promise,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“I	1
shall	1
do	1
him	1
no	1
further	1
harm,	1
though	1
he	1
well	1
deserves	1
it	1
of	1
me.”	1

Now	1
by	1
this	1
time	1
Sancho	1
had	1
risen,	1
rather	1
the	1
worse	1
for	1
the	1
handling	1
of	1
the	1
friars’	1
muleteers,	1
and	1
stood	1
watching	1
the	1
battle	1
of	1
his	1
master,	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
and	1
praying	1
to	1
God	1
in	1
his	1
heart	1
that	1
it	1
might	1
be	1
his	1
will	1
to	1
grant	1
him	1
the	1
victory,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
thereby	1
win	1
some	1
island	1
to	1
make	1
him	1
governor	1
of,	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
promised.	1
Seeing,	1
therefore,	1
that	1
the	1
struggle	1
was	1
now	1
over,	1
and	1
that	1
his	1
master	1
was	1
returning	1
to	1
mount	1
Rocinante,	1
he	1
approached	1
to	1
hold	1
the	1
stirrup	1
for	1
him,	1
and,	1
before	1
he	1
could	1
mount,	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
his	1
knees	1
before	1
him,	1
and	1
taking	1
his	1
hand,	1
kissed	1
it	1
saying,	1
“May	1
it	1
please	1
your	1
worship,	1
Señor	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
to	1
give	1
me	1
the	1
government	1
of	1
that	1
island	1
which	1
has	1
been	1
won	1
in	1
this	1
hard	1
fight,	1
for	1
be	1
it	1
ever	1
so	1
big	1
I	1
feel	1
myself	1
in	1
sufficient	1
force	1
to	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
govern	1
it	1
as	1
much	1
and	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
anyone	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
who	1
has	1
ever	1
governed	1
islands.”	1
To	1
which	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
replied,	1
“Thou	1
must	1
take	1
notice,	1
brother	1
Sancho,	1
that	1
this	1
adventure	1
and	1
those	1
like	1
it	1
are	1
not	1
adventures	1
of	1
islands,	1
but	1
of	1
cross-roads,	1
in	1
which	1
nothing	1
is	1
got	1
except	1
a	1
broken	1
head	1
or	1
an	1
ear	1
the	1
less:	1
have	1
patience,	1
for	1
adventures	1
will	1
present	1
themselves	1
from	1
which	1
I	1
may	1
make	1
you,	1
not	1
only	1
a	1
governor,	1
but	1
something	1
more.”	1
Sancho	1
gave	1
him	1
many	1
thanks,	1
and	1
again	1
kissing	1
his	1
hand	1
and	1
the	1
skirt	1
of	1
his	1
hauberk,	1
helped	1
him	1
to	1
mount	1
Rocinante,	1
and	1
mounting	1
his	1
ass	1
himself,	1
proceeded	1
to	1
follow	1
his	1
master,	1
who	1
at	1
a	1
brisk	1
pace,	1
without	1
taking	1
leave,	1
or	1
saying	1
anything	1
further	1
to	1
the	1
ladies	1
belonging	1
to	1
the	1
coach,	1
turned	1
into	1
a	1
wood	1
that	1
was	1
hard	1
by.	1
Sancho	1
followed	1
him	1
at	1
his	1
ass’s	1
best	1
trot,	1
but	1
Rocinante	1
stepped	1
out	1
so	1
that,	1
seeing	1
himself	1
left	1
behind,	1
he	1
was	1
forced	1
to	1
call	1
to	1
his	1
master	1
to	1
wait	1
for	1
him.	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
did	1
so,	1
reining	1
in	1
Rocinante	1
until	1
his	1
weary	1
squire	1
came	1
up,	1
who	1
on	1
reaching	1
him	1
said,	1
“It	1
seems	1
to	1
me,	1
señor,	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
prudent	1
in	1
us	1
to	1
go	1
and	1
take	1
refuge	1
in	1
some	1
church,	1
for,	1
seeing	1
how	1
mauled	1
he	1
with	1
whom	1
you	1
fought	1
has	1
been	1
left,	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
no	1
wonder	1
if	1
they	1
give	1
information	1
of	1
the	1
affair	1
to	1
the	1
Holy	1
Brotherhood	1
and	1
arrest	1
us,	1
and,	1
faith,	1
if	1
they	1
do,	1
before	1
we	1
come	1
out	1
of	1
gaol	1
we	1
shall	1
have	1
to	1
sweat	1
for	1
it.”	1
“Peace,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
“where	1
hast	1
thou	1
ever	1
seen	1
or	1
heard	1
that	1
a	1
knight-errant	1
has	1
been	1
arraigned	1
before	1
a	1
court	1
of	1
justice,	1
however	1
many	1
homicides	1
he	1
may	1
have	1
committed?”	1
“I	1
know	1
nothing	1
about	1
omecils,”	1
answered	1
Sancho,	1
“nor	1
in	1
my	1
life	1
have	1
had	1
anything	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
one;	1
I	1
only	1
know	1
that	1
the	1
Holy	1
Brotherhood	1
looks	1
after	1
those	1
who	1
fight	1
in	1
the	1
fields,	1
and	1
in	1
that	1
other	1
matter	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
meddle.”	1
“Then	1
thou	1
needst	1
have	1
no	1
uneasiness,	1
my	1
friend,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“for	1
I	1
will	1
deliver	1
thee	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
the	1
Chaldeans,	1
much	1
more	1
out	1
of	1
those	1
of	1
the	1
Brotherhood.	1
But	1
tell	1
me,	1
as	1
thou	1
livest,	1
hast	1
thou	1
seen	1
a	1
more	1
valiant	1
knight	1
than	1
I	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
known	1
world;	1
hast	1
thou	1
read	1
in	1
history	1
of	1
any	1
who	1
has	1
or	1
had	1
higher	1
mettle	1
in	1
attack,	1
more	1
spirit	1
in	1
maintaining	1
it,	1
more	1
dexterity	1
in	1
wounding	1
or	1
skill	1
in	1
overthrowing?”	1
“The	1
truth	1
is,”	1
answered	1
Sancho,	1
“that	1
I	1
have	1
never	1
read	1
any	1
history,	1
for	1
I	1
can	1
neither	1
read	1
nor	1
write,	1
but	1
what	1
I	1
will	1
venture	1
to	1
bet	1
is	1
that	1
a	1
more	1
daring	1
master	1
than	1
your	1
worship	1
I	1
have	1
never	1
served	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
my	1
life,	1
and	1
God	1
grant	1
that	1
this	1
daring	1
be	1
not	1
paid	1
for	1
where	1
I	1
have	1
said;	1
what	1
I	1
beg	1
of	1
your	1
worship	1
is	1
to	1
dress	1
your	1
wound,	1
for	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
of	1
blood	1
flows	1
from	1
that	1
ear,	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
here	1
some	1
lint	1
and	1
a	1
little	1
white	1
ointment	1
in	1
the	1
alforjas.”	1
“All	1
that	1
might	1
be	1
well	1
dispensed	1
with,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“if	1
I	1
had	1
remembered	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
vial	1
of	1
the	1
balsam	1
of	1
Fierabras,	1
for	1
time	1
and	1
medicine	1
are	1
saved	1
by	1
one	1
single	1
drop.”	1
“What	1
vial	1
and	1
what	1
balsam	1
is	1
that?”	1
said	1
Sancho	1
Panza.	1
“It	1
is	1
a	1
balsam,”	1
answered	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“the	1
receipt	1
of	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
in	1
my	1
memory,	1
with	1
which	1
one	1
need	1
have	1
no	1
fear	1
of	1
death,	1
or	1
dread	1
dying	1
of	1
any	1
wound;	1
and	1
so	1
when	1
I	1
make	1
it	1
and	1
give	1
it	1
to	1
thee	1
thou	1
hast	1
nothing	1
to	1
do	1
when	1
in	1
some	1
battle	1
thou	1
seest	1
they	1
have	1
cut	1
me	1
in	1
half	1
through	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
body—as	1
is	1
wont	1
to	1
happen	1
frequently—but	1
neatly	1
and	1
with	1
great	1
nicety,	1
ere	1
the	1
blood	1
congeal,	1
to	1
place	1
that	1
portion	1
of	1
the	1
body	1
which	1
shall	1
have	1
fallen	1
to	1
the	1
ground	1
upon	1
the	1
other	1
half	1
which	1
remains	1
in	1
the	1
saddle,	1
taking	1
care	1
to	1
fit	1
it	1
on	1
evenly	1
and	1
exactly.	1
Then	1
thou	1
shalt	1
give	1
me	1
to	1
drink	1
but	1
two	1
drops	1
of	1
the	1
balsam	1
I	1
have	1
mentioned,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
see	1
me	1
become	1
sounder	1
than	1
an	1
apple.”	1
“If	1
that	1
be	1
so,”	1
said	1
Panza,	1
“I	1
renounce	1
henceforth	1
the	1
government	1
of	1
the	1
promised	1
island,	1
and	1
desire	1
nothing	1
more	1
in	1
payment	1
of	1
my	1
many	1
and	1
faithful	1
services	1
than	1
that	1
your	1
worship	1
give	1
me	1
the	1
receipt	1
of	1
this	1
supreme	1
liquor,	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
persuaded	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
worth	1
more	1
than	1
two	1
reals	1
an	1
ounce	1
anywhere,	1
and	1
I	1
want	1
no	1
more	1
to	1
pass	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
my	1
life	1
in	1
ease	1
and	1
honour;	1
but	1
it	1
remains	1
to	1
be	1
told	1
if	1
it	1
costs	1
much	1
to	1
make	1
it.”	1
“With	1
less	1
than	1
three	1
reals,	1
six	1
quarts	1
of	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
made,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote.	1
“Sinner	1
that	1
I	1
am!”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“then	1
why	1
does	1
your	1
worship	1
put	1
off	1
making	1
it	1
and	1
teaching	1
it	1
to	1
me?”	1
“Peace,	1
friend,”	1
answered	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
“greater	1
secrets	1
I	1
mean	1
to	1
teach	1
thee	1
and	1
greater	1
favours	1
to	1
bestow	1
upon	1
thee;	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
present	1
let	1
us	1
see	1
to	1
the	1
dressing,	1
for	1
my	1
ear	1
pains	1
me	1
more	1
than	1
I	1
could	1
wish.”	1
Sancho	1
took	1
out	1
some	1
lint	1
and	1
ointment	1
from	1
the	1
alforjas;	1
but	1
when	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
came	1
to	1
see	1
his	1
helmet	1
shattered,	1
he	1
was	1
like	1
to	1
lose	1
his	1
senses,	1
and	1
clapping	1
his	1
hand	1
upon	1
his	1
sword	1
and	1
raising	1
his	1
eyes	1
to	1
heaven,	1
he	1
said,	1
“I	1
swear	1
by	1
the	1
Creator	1
of	1
all	1
things	1
and	1
the	1
four	1
Gospels	1
in	1
their	1
fullest	1
extent,	1
to	1
do	1
as	1
the	1
great	1
Marquis	1
of	1
Mantua	1
did	1
when	1
he	1
swore	1
to	1
avenge	1
the	1
death	1
of	1
his	1
nephew	1
Baldwin	1
(and	1
that	1
was	1
not	1
to	1
eat	1
bread	1
from	1
a	1
table-cloth,	1
nor	1
embrace	1
his	1
wife,	1
and	1
other	1
points	1
which,	1
though	1
I	1
cannot	1
now	1
call	1
them	1
to	1
mind,	1
I	1
here	1
grant	1
as	1
expressed)	1
until	1
I	1
take	1
complete	1
vengeance	1
upon	1
him	1
who	1
has	1
committed	1
such	1
an	1
offence	1
against	1
me.”	1
Hearing	1
this,	1
Sancho	1
said	1
to	1
him,	1
“Your	1
worship	1
should	1
bear	1
in	1
mind,	1
Señor	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
that	1
if	1
the	1
knight	1
has	1
done	1
what	1
was	1
commanded	1
him	1
in	1
going	1
to	1
present	1
himself	1
before	1
my	1
lady	1
Dulcinea	1
del	1
Toboso,	1
he	1
will	1
have	1
done	1
all	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
bound	1
to	1
do,	1
and	1
does	1
not	1
deserve	1
further	1
punishment	1
unless	1
he	1
commits	1
some	1
new	1
offence.”	1
“Thou	1
hast	1
said	1
well	1
and	1
hit	1
the	1
point,”	1
answered	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
and	1
so	1
I	1
recall	1
the	1
oath	1
in	1
so	1
far	1
as	1
relates	1
to	1
taking	1
fresh	1
vengeance	1
on	1
him,	1
but	1
I	1
make	1
and	1
confirm	1
it	1
anew	1
to	1
lead	1
the	1
life	1
I	1
have	1
said	1
until	1
such	1
time	1
as	1
I	1
take	1
by	1
force	1
from	1
some	1
knight	1
another	1
helmet	1
such	1
as	1
this	1
and	1
as	1
good;	1
and	1
think	1
not,	1
Sancho,	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
raising	1
smoke	1
with	1
straw	1
in	1
doing	1
so,	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
one	1
to	1
imitate	1
in	1
the	1
matter,	1
since	1
the	1
very	1
same	1
thing	1
to	1
a	1
hair	1
happened	1
in	1
the	1
case	1
of	1
Mambrino’s	1
helmet,	1
which	1
cost	1
Sacripante	1
so	1
dear.”	1
“Señor,”	1
replied	1
Sancho,	1
“let	1
your	1
worship	1
send	1
all	1
such	1
oaths	1
to	1
the	1
devil,	1
for	1
they	1
are	1
very	1
pernicious	1
to	1
salvation	1
and	1
prejudicial	1
to	1
the	1
conscience;	1
just	1
tell	1
me	1
now,	1
if	1
for	1
several	1
days	1
to	1
come	1
we	1
fall	1
in	1
with	1
no	1
man	1
armed	1
with	1
a	1
helmet,	1
what	1
are	1
we	1
to	1
do?	1
Is	1
the	1
oath	1
to	1
be	1
observed	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
inconvenience	1
and	1
discomfort	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
to	1
sleep	1
in	1
your	1
clothes,	1
and	1
not	1
to	1
sleep	1
in	1
a	1
house,	1
and	1
a	1
thousand	1
other	1
mortifications	1
contained	1
in	1
the	1
oath	1
of	1
that	1
old	1
fool	1
the	1
Marquis	1
of	1
Mantua,	1
which	1
your	1
worship	1
is	1
now	1
wanting	1
to	1
revive?	1
Let	1
your	1
worship	1
observe	1
that	1
there	1
are	1
no	1
men	1
in	1
armour	1
travelling	1
on	1
any	1
of	1
these	1
roads,	1
nothing	1
but	1
carriers	1
and	1
carters,	1
who	1
not	1
only	1
do	1
not	1
wear	1
helmets,	1
but	1
perhaps	1
never	1
heard	1
tell	1
of	1
them	1
all	1
their	1
lives.”	1
“Thou	1
art	1
wrong	1
there,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“for	1
we	1
shall	1
not	1
have	1
been	1
above	1
two	1
hours	1
among	1
these	1
cross-roads	1
before	1
we	1
see	1
more	1
men	1
in	1
armour	1
than	1
came	1
to	1
Albraca	1
to	1
win	1
the	1
fair	1
Angelica.”	1
“Enough,”	1
said	1
Sancho;	1
“so	1
be	1
it	1
then,	1
and	1
God	1
grant	1
us	1
success,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
time	1
for	1
winning	1
that	1
island	1
which	1
is	1
costing	1
me	1
so	1
dear	1
may	1
soon	1
come,	1
and	1
then	1
let	1
me	1
die.”	1
“I	1
have	1
already	1
told	1
thee,	1
Sancho,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“not	1
to	1
give	1
thyself	1
any	1
uneasiness	1
on	1
that	1
score;	1
for	1
if	1
an	1
island	1
should	1
fail,	1
there	1
is	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
Denmark,	1
or	1
of	1
Sobradisa,	1
which	1
will	1
fit	1
thee	1
as	1
a	1
ring	1
fits	1
the	1
finger,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
more	1
that,	1
being	1
on	1
_terra	1
firma_,	1
thou	1
wilt	1
all	1
the	1
better	1
enjoy	1
thyself.	1
But	1
let	1
us	1
leave	1
that	1
to	1
its	1
own	1
time;	1
see	1
if	1
thou	1
hast	1
anything	1
for	1
us	1
to	1
eat	1
in	1
those	1
alforjas,	1
because	1
we	1
must	1
presently	1
go	1
in	1
quest	1
of	1
some	1
castle	1
where	1
we	1
may	1
lodge	1
to-night	1
and	1
make	1
the	1
balsam	1
I	1
told	1
thee	1
of,	1
for	1
I	1
swear	1
to	1
thee	1
by	1
God,	1
this	1
ear	1
is	1
giving	1
me	1
great	1
pain.”	1
“I	1
have	1
here	1
an	1
onion	1
and	1
a	1
little	1
cheese	1
and	1
a	1
few	1
scraps	1
of	1
bread,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“but	1
they	1
are	1
not	1
victuals	1
fit	1
for	1
a	1
valiant	1
knight	1
like	1
your	1
worship.”	1
“How	1
little	1
thou	1
knowest	1
about	1
it,”	1
answered	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
“I	1
would	1
have	1
thee	1
to	1
know,	1
Sancho,	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
knights-errant	1
to	1
go	1
without	1
eating	1
for	1
a	1
month,	1
and	1
even	1
when	1
they	1
do	1
eat,	1
that	1
it	1
should	1
be	1
of	1
what	1
comes	1
first	1
to	1
hand;	1
and	1
this	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
clear	1
to	1
thee	1
hadst	1
thou	1
read	1
as	1
many	1
histories	1
as	1
I	1
have,	1
for,	1
though	1
they	1
are	1
very	1
many,	1
among	1
them	1
all	1
I	1
have	1
found	1
no	1
mention	1
made	1
of	1
knights-errant	1
eating,	1
unless	1
by	1
accident	1
or	1
at	1
some	1
sumptuous	1
banquets	1
prepared	1
for	1
them,	1
and	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
time	1
they	1
passed	1
in	1
dalliance.	1
And	1
though	1
it	1
is	1
plain	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
do	1
without	1
eating	1
and	1
performing	1
all	1
the	1
other	1
natural	1
functions,	1
because,	1
in	1
fact,	1
they	1
were	1
men	1
like	1
ourselves,	1
it	1
is	1
plain	1
too	1
that,	1
wandering	1
as	1
they	1
did	1
the	1
most	1
part	1
of	1
their	1
lives	1
through	1
woods	1
and	1
wilds	1
and	1
without	1
a	1
cook,	1
their	1
most	1
usual	1
fare	1
would	1
be	1
rustic	1
viands	1
such	1
as	1
those	1
thou	1
now	1
offer	1
me;	1
so	1
that,	1
friend	1
Sancho,	1
let	1
not	1
that	1
distress	1
thee	1
which	1
pleases	1
me,	1
and	1
do	1
not	1
seek	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
new	1
world	1
or	1
pervert	1
knight-errantry.”	1
“Pardon	1
me,	1
your	1
worship,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“for,	1
as	1
I	1
cannot	1
read	1
or	1
write,	1
as	1
I	1
said	1
just	1
now,	1
I	1
neither	1
know	1
nor	1
comprehend	1
the	1
rules	1
of	1
the	1
profession	1
of	1
chivalry:	1
henceforward	1
I	1
will	1
stock	1
the	1
alforjas	1
with	1
every	1
kind	1
of	1
dry	1
fruit	1
for	1
your	1
worship,	1
as	1
you	1
are	1
a	1
knight;	1
and	1
for	1
myself,	1
as	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
one,	1
I	1
will	1
furnish	1
them	1
with	1
poultry	1
and	1
other	1
things	1
more	1
substantial.”	1
“I	1
do	1
not	1
say,	1
Sancho,”	1
replied	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“that	1
it	1
is	1
imperative	1
on	1
knights-errant	1
not	1
to	1
eat	1
anything	1
else	1
but	1
the	1
fruits	1
thou	1
speakest	1
of;	1
only	1
that	1
their	1
more	1
usual	1
diet	1
must	1
be	1
those,	1
and	1
certain	1
herbs	1
they	1
found	1
in	1
the	1
fields	1
which	1
they	1
knew	1
and	1
I	1
know	1
too.”	1
“A	1
good	1
thing	1
it	1
is,”	1
answered	1
Sancho,	1
“to	1
know	1
those	1
herbs,	1
for	1
to	1
my	1
thinking	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
needful	1
some	1
day	1
to	1
put	1
that	1
knowledge	1
into	1
practice.”	1
And	1
here	1
taking	1
out	1
what	1
he	1
said	1
he	1
had	1
brought,	1
the	1
pair	1
made	1
their	1
repast	1
peaceably	1
and	1
sociably.	1
But	1
anxious	1
to	1
find	1
quarters	1
for	1
the	1
night,	1
they	1
with	1
all	1
despatch	1
made	1
an	1
end	1
of	1
their	1
poor	1
dry	1
fare,	1
mounted	1
at	1
once,	1
and	1
made	1
haste	1
to	1
reach	1
some	1
habitation	1
before	1
night	1
set	1
in;	1
but	1
daylight	1
and	1
the	1
hope	1
of	1
succeeding	1
in	1
their	1
object	1
failed	1
them	1
close	1
by	1
the	1
huts	1
of	1
some	1
goatherds,	1
so	1
they	1
determined	1
to	1
pass	1
the	1
night	1
there,	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
as	1
much	1
to	1
Sancho’s	1
discontent	1
not	1
to	1
have	1
reached	1
a	1
house,	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
to	1
his	1
master’s	1
satisfaction	1
to	1
sleep	1
under	1
the	1
open	1
heaven,	1
for	1
he	1
fancied	1
that	1
each	1
time	1
this	1
happened	1
to	1
him	1
he	1
performed	1
an	1
act	1
of	1
ownership	1
that	1
helped	1
to	1
prove	1
his	1
chivalry.	1

He	1
was	1
cordially	1
welcomed	1
by	1
the	1
goatherds,	1
and	1
Sancho,	1
having	1
as	1
best	1
he	1
could	1
put	1
up	1
Rocinante	1
and	1
the	1
ass,	1
drew	1
towards	1
the	1
fragrance	1
that	1
came	1
from	1
some	1
pieces	1
of	1
salted	1
goat	1
simmering	1
in	1
a	1
pot	1
on	1
the	1
fire;	1
and	1
though	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
liked	1
at	1
once	1
to	1
try	1
if	1
they	1
were	1
ready	1
to	1
be	1
transferred	1
from	1
the	1
pot	1
to	1
the	1
stomach,	1
he	1
refrained	1
from	1
doing	1
so	1
as	1
the	1
goatherds	1
removed	1
them	1
from	1
the	1
fire,	1
and	1
laying	1
sheepskins	1
on	1
the	1
ground,	1
quickly	1
spread	1
their	1
rude	1
table,	1
and	1
with	1
signs	1
of	1
hearty	1
good-will	1
invited	1
them	1
both	1
to	1
share	1
what	1
they	1
had.	1
Round	1
the	1
skins	1
six	1
of	1
the	1
men	1
belonging	1
to	1
the	1
fold	1
seated	1
themselves,	1
having	1
first	1
with	1
rough	1
politeness	1
pressed	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
to	1
take	1
a	1
seat	1
upon	1
a	1
trough	1
which	1
they	1
placed	1
for	1
him	1
upside	1
down.	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
seated	1
himself,	1
and	1
Sancho	1
remained	1
standing	1
to	1
serve	1
the	1
cup,	1
which	1
was	1
made	1
of	1
horn.	1
Seeing	1
him	1
standing,	1
his	1
master	1
said	1
to	1
him:	1
“That	1
thou	1
mayest	1
see,	1
Sancho,	1
the	1
good	1
that	1
knight-errantry	1
contains	1
in	1
itself,	1
and	1
how	1
those	1
who	1
fill	1
any	1
office	1
in	1
it	1
are	1
on	1
the	1
high	1
road	1
to	1
be	1
speedily	1
honoured	1
and	1
esteemed	1
by	1
the	1
world,	1
I	1
desire	1
that	1
thou	1
seat	1
thyself	1
here	1
at	1
my	1
side	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
company	1
of	1
these	1
worthy	1
people,	1
and	1
that	1
thou	1
be	1
one	1
with	1
me	1
who	1
am	1
thy	1
master	1
and	1
natural	1
lord,	1
and	1
that	1
thou	1
eat	1
from	1
my	1
plate	1
and	1
drink	1
from	1
whatever	1
I	1
drink	1
from;	1
for	1
the	1
same	1
may	1
be	1
said	1
of	1
knight-errantry	1
as	1
of	1
love,	1
that	1
it	1
levels	1
all.”	1
“Great	1
thanks,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“but	1
I	1
may	1
tell	1
your	1
worship	1
that	1
provided	1
I	1
have	1
enough	1
to	1
eat,	1
I	1
can	1
eat	1
it	1
as	1
well,	1
or	1
better,	1
standing,	1
and	1
by	1
myself,	1
than	1
seated	1
alongside	1
of	1
an	1
emperor.	1
And	1
indeed,	1
if	1
the	1
truth	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
told,	1
what	1
I	1
eat	1
in	1
my	1
corner	1
without	1
form	1
or	1
fuss	1
has	1
much	1
more	1
relish	1
for	1
me,	1
even	1
though	1
it	1
be	1
bread	1
and	1
onions,	1
than	1
the	1
turkeys	1
of	1
those	1
other	1
tables	1
where	1
I	1
am	1
forced	1
to	1
chew	1
slowly,	1
drink	1
little,	1
wipe	1
my	1
mouth	1
every	1
minute,	1
and	1
cannot	1
sneeze	1
or	1
cough	1
if	1
I	1
want	1
or	1
do	1
other	1
things	1
that	1
are	1
the	1
privileges	1
of	1
liberty	1
and	1
solitude.	1
So,	1
señor,	1
as	1
for	1
these	1
honours	1
which	1
your	1
worship	1
would	1
put	1
upon	1
me	1
as	1
a	1
servant	1
and	1
follower	1
of	1
knight-errantry,	1
exchange	1
them	1
for	1
other	1
things	1
which	1
may	1
be	1
of	1
more	1
use	1
and	1
advantage	1
to	1
me;	1
for	1
these,	1
though	1
I	1
fully	1
acknowledge	1
them	1
as	1
received,	1
I	1
renounce	1
from	1
this	1
moment	1
to	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
world.”	1
“For	1
all	1
that,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“thou	1
must	1
seat	1
thyself,	1
because	1
him	1
who	1
humbleth	1
himself	1
God	1
exalteth;”	1
and	1
seizing	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
arm	1
he	1
forced	1
him	1
to	1
sit	1
down	1
beside	1
himself.	1
The	1
goatherds	1
did	1
not	1
understand	1
this	1
jargon	1
about	1
squires	1
and	1
knights-errant,	1
and	1
all	1
they	1
did	1
was	1
to	1
eat	1
in	1
silence	1
and	1
stare	1
at	1
their	1
guests,	1
who	1
with	1
great	1
elegance	1
and	1
appetite	1
were	1
stowing	1
away	1
pieces	1
as	1
big	1
as	1
one’s	1
fist.	1
The	1
course	1
of	1
meat	1
finished,	1
they	1
spread	1
upon	1
the	1
sheepskins	1
a	1
great	1
heap	1
of	1
parched	1
acorns,	1
and	1
with	1
them	1
they	1
put	1
down	1
a	1
half	1
cheese	1
harder	1
than	1
if	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
made	1
of	1
mortar.	1
All	1
this	1
while	1
the	1
horn	1
was	1
not	1
idle,	1
for	1
it	1
went	1
round	1
so	1
constantly,	1
now	1
full,	1
now	1
empty,	1
like	1
the	1
bucket	1
of	1
a	1
water-wheel,	1
that	1
it	1
soon	1
drained	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
two	1
wine-skins	1
that	1
were	1
in	1
sight.	1
When	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
had	1
quite	1
appeased	1
his	1
appetite	1
he	1
took	1
up	1
a	1
handful	1
of	1
the	1
acorns,	1
and	1
contemplating	1
them	1
attentively	1
delivered	1
himself	1
somewhat	1
in	1
this	1
fashion:	1
“Happy	1
the	1
age,	1
happy	1
the	1
time,	1
to	1
which	1
the	1
ancients	1
gave	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
golden,	1
not	1
because	1
in	1
that	1
fortunate	1
age	1
the	1
gold	1
so	1
coveted	1
in	1
this	1
our	1
iron	1
one	1
was	1
gained	1
without	1
toil,	1
but	1
because	1
they	1
that	1
lived	1
in	1
it	1
knew	1
not	1
the	1
two	1
words	1
“_mine_”	1
and	1
“_thine_”!	1
In	1
that	1
blessed	1
age	1
all	1
things	1
were	1
in	1
common;	1
to	1
win	1
the	1
daily	1
food	1
no	1
labour	1
was	1
required	1
of	1
any	1
save	1
to	1
stretch	1
forth	1
his	1
hand	1
and	1
gather	1
it	1
from	1
the	1
sturdy	1
oaks	1
that	1
stood	1
generously	1
inviting	1
him	1
with	1
their	1
sweet	1
ripe	1
fruit.	1
The	1
clear	1
streams	1
and	1
running	1
brooks	1
yielded	1
their	1
savoury	1
limpid	1
waters	1
in	1
noble	1
abundance.	1
The	1
busy	1
and	1
sagacious	1
bees	1
fixed	1
their	1
republic	1
in	1
the	1
clefts	1
of	1
the	1
rocks	1
and	1
hollows	1
of	1
the	1
trees,	1
offering	1
without	1
usance	1
the	1
plenteous	1
produce	1
of	1
their	1
fragrant	1
toil	1
to	1
every	1
hand.	1
The	1
mighty	1
cork	1
trees,	1
unenforced	1
save	1
of	1
their	1
own	1
courtesy,	1
shed	1
the	1
broad	1
light	1
bark	1
that	1
served	1
at	1
first	1
to	1
roof	1
the	1
houses	1
supported	1
by	1
rude	1
stakes,	1
a	1
protection	1
against	1
the	1
inclemency	1
of	1
heaven	1
alone.	1
Then	1
all	1
was	1
peace,	1
all	1
friendship,	1
all	1
concord;	1
as	1
yet	1
the	1
dull	1
share	1
of	1
the	1
crooked	1
plough	1
had	1
not	1
dared	1
to	1
rend	1
and	1
pierce	1
the	1
tender	1
bowels	1
of	1
our	1
first	1
mother	1
that	1
without	1
compulsion	1
yielded	1
from	1
every	1
portion	1
of	1
her	1
broad	1
fertile	1
bosom	1
all	1
that	1
could	1
satisfy,	1
sustain,	1
and	1
delight	1
the	1
children	1
that	1
then	1
possessed	1
her.	1
Then	1
was	1
it	1
that	1
the	1
innocent	1
and	1
fair	1
young	1
shepherdess	1
roamed	1
from	1
vale	1
to	1
vale	1
and	1
hill	1
to	1
hill,	1
with	1
flowing	1
locks,	1
and	1
no	1
more	1
garments	1
than	1
were	1
needful	1
modestly	1
to	1
cover	1
what	1
modesty	1
seeks	1
and	1
ever	1
sought	1
to	1
hide.	1
Nor	1
were	1
their	1
ornaments	1
like	1
those	1
in	1
use	1
to-day,	1
set	1
off	1
by	1
Tyrian	1
purple,	1
and	1
silk	1
tortured	1
in	1
endless	1
fashions,	1
but	1
the	1
wreathed	1
leaves	1
of	1
the	1
green	1
dock	1
and	1
ivy,	1
wherewith	1
they	1
went	1
as	1
bravely	1
and	1
becomingly	1
decked	1
as	1
our	1
Court	1
dames	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
rare	1
and	1
far-fetched	1
artifices	1
that	1
idle	1
curiosity	1
has	1
taught	1
them.	1
Then	1
the	1
love-thoughts	1
of	1
the	1
heart	1
clothed	1
themselves	1
simply	1
and	1
naturally	1
as	1
the	1
heart	1
conceived	1
them,	1
nor	1
sought	1
to	1
commend	1
themselves	1
by	1
forced	1
and	1
rambling	1
verbiage.	1
Fraud,	1
deceit,	1
or	1
malice	1
had	1
then	1
not	1
yet	1
mingled	1
with	1
truth	1
and	1
sincerity.	1
Justice	1
held	1
her	1
ground,	1
undisturbed	1
and	1
unassailed	1
by	1
the	1
efforts	1
of	1
favour	1
and	1
of	1
interest,	1
that	1
now	1
so	1
much	1
impair,	1
pervert,	1
and	1
beset	1
her.	1
Arbitrary	1
law	1
had	1
not	1
yet	1
established	1
itself	1
in	1
the	1
mind	1
of	1
the	1
judge,	1
for	1
then	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
cause	1
to	1
judge	1
and	1
no	1
one	1
to	1
be	1
judged.	1
Maidens	1
and	1
modesty,	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
said,	1
wandered	1
at	1
will	1
alone	1
and	1
unattended,	1
without	1
fear	1
of	1
insult	1
from	1
lawlessness	1
or	1
libertine	1
assault,	1
and	1
if	1
they	1
were	1
undone	1
it	1
was	1
of	1
their	1
own	1
will	1
and	1
pleasure.	1
But	1
now	1
in	1
this	1
hateful	1
age	1
of	1
ours	1
not	1
one	1
is	1
safe,	1
not	1
though	1
some	1
new	1
labyrinth	1
like	1
that	1
of	1
Crete	1
conceal	1
and	1
surround	1
her;	1
even	1
there	1
the	1
pestilence	1
of	1
gallantry	1
will	1
make	1
its	1
way	1
to	1
them	1
through	1
chinks	1
or	1
on	1
the	1
air	1
by	1
the	1
zeal	1
of	1
its	1
accursed	1
importunity,	1
and,	1
despite	1
of	1
all	1
seclusion,	1
lead	1
them	1
to	1
ruin.	1
In	1
defence	1
of	1
these,	1
as	1
time	1
advanced	1
and	1
wickedness	1
increased,	1
the	1
order	1
of	1
knights-errant	1
was	1
instituted,	1
to	1
defend	1
maidens,	1
to	1
protect	1
widows	1
and	1
to	1
succour	1
the	1
orphans	1
and	1
the	1
needy.	1
To	1
this	1
order	1
I	1
belong,	1
brother	1
goatherds,	1
to	1
whom	1
I	1
return	1
thanks	1
for	1
the	1
hospitality	1
and	1
kindly	1
welcome	1
ye	1
offer	1
me	1
and	1
my	1
squire;	1
for	1
though	1
by	1
natural	1
law	1
all	1
living	1
are	1
bound	1
to	1
show	1
favour	1
to	1
knights-errant,	1
yet,	1
seeing	1
that	1
without	1
knowing	1
this	1
obligation	1
ye	1
have	1
welcomed	1
and	1
feasted	1
me,	1
it	1
is	1
right	1
that	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
good-will	1
in	1
my	1
power	1
I	1
should	1
thank	1
you	1
for	1
yours.”	1

All	1
this	1
long	1
harangue	1
(which	1
might	1
very	1
well	1
have	1
been	1
spared)	1
our	1
knight	1
delivered	1
because	1
the	1
acorns	1
they	1
gave	1
him	1
reminded	1
him	1
of	1
the	1
golden	1
age;	1
and	1
the	1
whim	1
seized	1
him	1
to	1
address	1
all	1
this	1
unnecessary	1
argument	1
to	1
the	1
goatherds,	1
who	1
listened	1
to	1
him	1
gaping	1
in	1
amazement	1
without	1
saying	1
a	1
word	1
in	1
reply.	1
Sancho	1
likewise	1
held	1
his	1
peace	1
and	1
ate	1
acorns,	1
and	1
paid	1
repeated	1
visits	1
to	1
the	1
second	1
wine-skin,	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
hung	1
up	1
on	1
a	1
cork	1
tree	1
to	1
keep	1
the	1
wine	1
cool.	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
was	1
longer	1
in	1
talking	1
than	1
the	1
supper	1
in	1
finishing,	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
which	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
goatherds	1
said,	1
“That	1
your	1
worship,	1
señor	1
knight-errant,	1
may	1
say	1
with	1
more	1
truth	1
that	1
we	1
show	1
you	1
hospitality	1
with	1
ready	1
good-will,	1
we	1
will	1
give	1
you	1
amusement	1
and	1
pleasure	1
by	1
making	1
one	1
of	1
our	1
comrades	1
sing:	1
he	1
will	1
be	1
here	1
before	1
long,	1
and	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
very	1
intelligent	1
youth	1
and	1
deep	1
in	1
love,	1
and	1
what	1
is	1
more	1
he	1
can	1
read	1
and	1
write	1
and	1
play	1
on	1
the	1
rebeck	1
to	1
perfection.”	1
The	1
goatherd	1
had	1
hardly	1
done	1
speaking,	1
when	1
the	1
notes	1
of	1
the	1
rebeck	1
reached	1
their	1
ears;	1
and	1
shortly	1
after,	1
the	1
player	1
came	1
up,	1
a	1
very	1
good-looking	1
young	1
man	1
of	1
about	1
two-and-twenty.	1
His	1
comrades	1
asked	1
him	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
supped,	1
and	1
on	1
his	1
replying	1
that	1
he	1
had,	1
he	1
who	1
had	1
already	1
made	1
the	1
offer	1
said	1
to	1
him:	1
“In	1
that	1
case,	1
Antonio,	1
thou	1
mayest	1
as	1
well	1
do	1
us	1
the	1
pleasure	1
of	1
singing	1
a	1
little,	1
that	1
the	1
gentleman,	1
our	1
guest,	1
may	1
see	1
that	1
even	1
in	1
the	1
mountains	1
and	1
woods	1
there	1
are	1
musicians:	1
we	1
have	1
told	1
him	1
of	1
thy	1
accomplishments,	1
and	1
we	1
want	1
thee	1
to	1
show	1
them	1
and	1
prove	1
that	1
we	1
say	1
true;	1
so,	1
as	1
thou	1
livest,	1
pray	1
sit	1
down	1
and	1
sing	1
that	1
ballad	1
about	1
thy	1
love	1
that	1
thy	1
uncle	1
the	1
prebendary	1
made	1
thee,	1
and	1
that	1
was	1
so	1
much	1
liked	1
in	1
the	1
town.”	1
“With	1
all	1
my	1
heart,”	1
said	1
the	1
young	1
man,	1
and	1
without	1
waiting	1
for	1
more	1
pressing	1
he	1
seated	1
himself	1
on	1
the	1
trunk	1
of	1
a	1
felled	1
oak,	1
and	1
tuning	1
his	1
rebeck,	1
presently	1
began	1
to	1
sing	1
to	1
these	1
words.	1
ANTONIO’S	1
BALLAD	1
Thou	1
dost	1
love	1
me	1
well,	1
Olalla;	1
Well	1
I	1
know	1
it,	1
even	1
though	1
Love’s	1
mute	1
tongues,	1
thine	1
eyes,	1
have	1
never	1
By	1
their	1
glances	1
told	1
me	1
so.	1
For	1
I	1
know	1
my	1
love	1
thou	1
knowest,	1
Therefore	1
thine	1
to	1
claim	1
I	1
dare:	1
Once	1
it	1
ceases	1
to	1
be	1
secret,	1
Love	1
need	1
never	1
feel	1
despair.	1
True	1
it	1
is,	1
Olalla,	1
sometimes	1
Thou	1
hast	1
all	1
too	1
plainly	1
shown	1
That	1
thy	1
heart	1
is	1
brass	1
in	1
hardness,	1
And	1
thy	1
snowy	1
bosom	1
stone.	1
Yet	1
for	1
all	1
that,	1
in	1
thy	1
coyness,	1
And	1
thy	1
fickle	1
fits	1
between,	1
Hope	1
is	1
there—at	1
least	1
the	1
border	1
Of	1
her	1
garment	1
may	1
be	1
seen.	1
Lures	1
to	1
faith	1
are	1
they,	1
those	1
glimpses,	1
And	1
to	1
faith	1
in	1
thee	1
I	1
hold;	1
Kindness	1
cannot	1
make	1
it	1
stronger,	1
Coldness	1
cannot	1
make	1
it	1
cold.	1
If	1
it	1
be	1
that	1
love	1
is	1
gentle,	1
In	1
thy	1
gentleness	1
I	1
see	1
Something	1
holding	1
out	1
assurance	1
To	1
the	1
hope	1
of	1
winning	1
thee.	1
If	1
it	1
be	1
that	1
in	1
devotion	1
Lies	1
a	1
power	1
hearts	1
to	1
move,	1
That	1
which	1
every	1
day	1
I	1
show	1
thee,	1
Helpful	1
to	1
my	1
suit	1
should	1
prove.	1
Many	1
a	1
time	1
thou	1
must	1
have	1
noticed—	1
If	1
to	1
notice	1
thou	1
dost	1
care—	1
How	1
I	1
go	1
about	1
on	1
Monday	1
Dressed	1
in	1
all	1
my	1
Sunday	1
wear.	1
Love’s	1
eyes	1
love	1
to	1
look	1
on	1
brightness;	1
Love	1
loves	1
what	1
is	1
gaily	1
drest;	1
Sunday,	1
Monday,	1
all	1
I	1
care	1
is	1
Thou	1
shouldst	1
see	1
me	1
in	1
my	1
best.	1
No	1
account	1
I	1
make	1
of	1
dances,	1
Or	1
of	1
strains	1
that	1
pleased	1
thee	1
so,	1
Keeping	1
thee	1
awake	1
from	1
midnight	1
Till	1
the	1
cocks	1
began	1
to	1
crow;	1
Or	1
of	1
how	1
I	1
roundly	1
swore	1
it	1
That	1
there’s	1
none	1
so	1
fair	1
as	1
thou;	1
True	1
it	1
is,	1
but	1
as	1
I	1
said	1
it,	1
By	1
the	1
girls	1
I’m	1
hated	1
now.	1
For	1
Teresa	1
of	1
the	1
hillside	1
At	1
my	1
praise	1
of	1
thee	1
was	1
sore;	1
Said,	1
“You	1
think	1
you	1
love	1
an	1
angel;	1
It’s	1
a	1
monkey	1
you	1
adore;	1
“Caught	1
by	1
all	1
her	1
glittering	1
trinkets,	1
And	1
her	1
borrowed	1
braids	1
of	1
hair,	1
And	1
a	1
host	1
of	1
made-up	1
beauties	1
That	1
would	1
Love	1
himself	1
ensnare.”	1
’Twas	1
a	1
lie,	1
and	1
so	1
I	1
told	1
her,	1
And	1
her	1
cousin	1
at	1
the	1
word	1
Gave	1
me	1
his	1
defiance	1
for	1
it;	1
And	1
what	1
followed	1
thou	1
hast	1
heard.	1
Mine	1
is	1
no	1
high-flown	1
affection,	1
Mine	1
no	1
passion	1
_par	1
amours_—	1
As	1
they	1
call	1
it—what	1
I	1
offer	1
Is	1
an	1
honest	1
love,	1
and	1
pure.	1
Cunning	1
cords	1
the	1
holy	1
Church	1
has,	1
Cords	1
of	1
softest	1
silk	1
they	1
be;	1
Put	1
thy	1
neck	1
beneath	1
the	1
yoke,	1
dear;	1
Mine	1
will	1
follow,	1
thou	1
wilt	1
see.	1
Else—and	1
once	1
for	1
all	1
I	1
swear	1
it	1
By	1
the	1
saint	1
of	1
most	1
renown—	1
If	1
I	1
ever	1
quit	1
the	1
mountains,	1
’Twill	1
be	1
in	1
a	1
friar’s	1
gown.	1
Here	1
the	1
goatherd	1
brought	1
his	1
song	1
to	1
an	1
end,	1
and	1
though	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
entreated	1
him	1
to	1
sing	1
more,	1
Sancho	1
had	1
no	1
mind	1
that	1
way,	1
being	1
more	1
inclined	1
for	1
sleep	1
than	1
for	1
listening	1
to	1
songs;	1
so	1
said	1
he	1
to	1
his	1
master,	1
“Your	1
worship	1
will	1
do	1
well	1
to	1
settle	1
at	1
once	1
where	1
you	1
mean	1
to	1
pass	1
the	1
night,	1
for	1
the	1
labour	1
these	1
good	1
men	1
are	1
at	1
all	1
day	1
does	1
not	1
allow	1
them	1
to	1
spend	1
the	1
night	1
in	1
singing.”	1
“I	1
understand	1
thee,	1
Sancho,”	1
replied	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
“I	1
perceive	1
clearly	1
that	1
those	1
visits	1
to	1
the	1
wine-skin	1
demand	1
compensation	1
in	1
sleep	1
rather	1
than	1
in	1
music.”	1
“It’s	1
sweet	1
to	1
us	1
all,	1
blessed	1
be	1
God,”	1
said	1
Sancho.	1
“I	1
do	1
not	1
deny	1
it,”	1
replied	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
“but	1
settle	1
thyself	1
where	1
thou	1
wilt;	1
those	1
of	1
my	1
calling	1
are	1
more	1
becomingly	1
employed	1
in	1
watching	1
than	1
in	1
sleeping;	1
still	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
as	1
well	1
if	1
thou	1
wert	1
to	1
dress	1
this	1
ear	1
for	1
me	1
again,	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
giving	1
me	1
more	1
pain	1
than	1
it	1
need.”	1
Sancho	1
did	1
as	1
he	1
bade	1
him,	1
but	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
goatherds,	1
seeing	1
the	1
wound,	1
told	1
him	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
uneasy,	1
as	1
he	1
would	1
apply	1
a	1
remedy	1
with	1
which	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
soon	1
healed;	1
and	1
gathering	1
some	1
leaves	1
of	1
rosemary,	1
of	1
which	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
great	1
quantity	1
there,	1
he	1
chewed	1
them	1
and	1
mixed	1
them	1
with	1
a	1
little	1
salt,	1
and	1
applying	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
ear	1
he	1
secured	1
them	1
firmly	1
with	1
a	1
bandage,	1
assuring	1
him	1
that	1
no	1
other	1
treatment	1
would	1
be	1
required,	1
and	1
so	1
it	1
proved.	1

Just	1
then	1
another	1
young	1
man,	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
fetched	1
their	1
provisions	1
from	1
the	1
village,	1
came	1
up	1
and	1
said,	1
“Do	1
you	1
know	1
what	1
is	1
going	1
on	1
in	1
the	1
village,	1
comrades?”	1
“How	1
could	1
we	1
know	1
it?”	1
replied	1
one	1
of	1
them.	1
“Well,	1
then,	1
you	1
must	1
know,”	1
continued	1
the	1
young	1
man,	1
“this	1
morning	1
that	1
famous	1
student-shepherd	1
called	1
Chrysostom	1
died,	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
rumoured	1
that	1
he	1
died	1
of	1
love	1
for	1
that	1
devil	1
of	1
a	1
village	1
girl	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
Guillermo	1
the	1
Rich,	1
she	1
that	1
wanders	1
about	1
the	1
wolds	1
here	1
in	1
the	1
dress	1
of	1
a	1
shepherdess.”	1
“You	1
mean	1
Marcela?”	1
said	1
one.	1
“Her	1
I	1
mean,”	1
answered	1
the	1
goatherd;	1
“and	1
the	1
best	1
of	1
it	1
is,	1
he	1
has	1
directed	1
in	1
his	1
will	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
buried	1
in	1
the	1
fields	1
like	1
a	1
Moor,	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
foot	1
of	1
the	1
rock	1
where	1
the	1
Cork-tree	1
spring	1
is,	1
because,	1
as	1
the	1
story	1
goes	1
(and	1
they	1
say	1
he	1
himself	1
said	1
so),	1
that	1
was	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
he	1
first	1
saw	1
her.	1
And	1
he	1
has	1
also	1
left	1
other	1
directions	1
which	1
the	1
clergy	1
of	1
the	1
village	1
say	1
should	1
not	1
and	1
must	1
not	1
be	1
obeyed	1
because	1
they	1
savour	1
of	1
paganism.	1
To	1
all	1
which	1
his	1
great	1
friend	1
Ambrosio	1
the	1
student,	1
he	1
who,	1
like	1
him,	1
also	1
went	1
dressed	1
as	1
a	1
shepherd,	1
replies	1
that	1
everything	1
must	1
be	1
done	1
without	1
any	1
omission	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
directions	1
left	1
by	1
Chrysostom,	1
and	1
about	1
this	1
the	1
village	1
is	1
all	1
in	1
commotion;	1
however,	1
report	1
says	1
that,	1
after	1
all,	1
what	1
Ambrosio	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
shepherds	1
his	1
friends	1
desire	1
will	1
be	1
done,	1
and	1
to-morrow	1
they	1
are	1
coming	1
to	1
bury	1
him	1
with	1
great	1
ceremony	1
where	1
I	1
said.	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
something	1
worth	1
seeing;	1
at	1
least	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
fail	1
to	1
go	1
and	1
see	1
it	1
even	1
if	1
I	1
knew	1
I	1
should	1
not	1
return	1
to	1
the	1
village	1
to-morrow.”	1
“We	1
will	1
do	1
the	1
same,”	1
answered	1
the	1
goatherds,	1
“and	1
cast	1
lots	1
to	1
see	1
who	1
must	1
stay	1
to	1
mind	1
the	1
goats	1
of	1
all.”	1
“Thou	1
sayest	1
well,	1
Pedro,”	1
said	1
one,	1
“though	1
there	1
will	1
be	1
no	1
need	1
of	1
taking	1
that	1
trouble,	1
for	1
I	1
will	1
stay	1
behind	1
for	1
all;	1
and	1
don’t	1
suppose	1
it	1
is	1
virtue	1
or	1
want	1
of	1
curiosity	1
in	1
me;	1
it	1
is	1
that	1
the	1
splinter	1
that	1
ran	1
into	1
my	1
foot	1
the	1
other	1
day	1
will	1
not	1
let	1
me	1
walk.”	1
“For	1
all	1
that,	1
we	1
thank	1
thee,”	1
answered	1
Pedro.	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
asked	1
Pedro	1
to	1
tell	1
him	1
who	1
the	1
dead	1
man	1
was	1
and	1
who	1
the	1
shepherdess,	1
to	1
which	1
Pedro	1
replied	1
that	1
all	1
he	1
knew	1
was	1
that	1
the	1
dead	1
man	1
was	1
a	1
wealthy	1
gentleman	1
belonging	1
to	1
a	1
village	1
in	1
those	1
mountains,	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
a	1
student	1
at	1
Salamanca	1
for	1
many	1
years,	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
returned	1
to	1
his	1
village	1
with	1
the	1
reputation	1
of	1
being	1
very	1
learned	1
and	1
deeply	1
read.	1
“Above	1
all,	1
they	1
said,	1
he	1
was	1
learned	1
in	1
the	1
science	1
of	1
the	1
stars	1
and	1
of	1
what	1
went	1
on	1
yonder	1
in	1
the	1
heavens	1
and	1
the	1
sun	1
and	1
the	1
moon,	1
for	1
he	1
told	1
us	1
of	1
the	1
cris	1
of	1
the	1
sun	1
and	1
moon	1
to	1
exact	1
time.”	1
“Eclipse	1
it	1
is	1
called,	1
friend,	1
not	1
cris,	1
the	1
darkening	1
of	1
those	1
two	1
luminaries,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
but	1
Pedro,	1
not	1
troubling	1
himself	1
with	1
trifles,	1
went	1
on	1
with	1
his	1
story,	1
saying,	1
“Also	1
he	1
foretold	1
when	1
the	1
year	1
was	1
going	1
to	1
be	1
one	1
of	1
abundance	1
or	1
estility.”	1
“Sterility,	1
you	1
mean,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote.	1
“Sterility	1
or	1
estility,”	1
answered	1
Pedro,	1
“it	1
is	1
all	1
the	1
same	1
in	1
the	1
end.	1
And	1
I	1
can	1
tell	1
you	1
that	1
by	1
this	1
his	1
father	1
and	1
friends	1
who	1
believed	1
him	1
grew	1
very	1
rich	1
because	1
they	1
did	1
as	1
he	1
advised	1
them,	1
bidding	1
them	1
‘sow	1
barley	1
this	1
year,	1
not	1
wheat;	1
this	1
year	1
you	1
may	1
sow	1
pulse	1
and	1
not	1
barley;	1
the	1
next	1
there	1
will	1
be	1
a	1
full	1
oil	1
crop,	1
and	1
the	1
three	1
following	1
not	1
a	1
drop	1
will	1
be	1
got.’”	1
“That	1
science	1
is	1
called	1
astrology,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote.	1
“I	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
what	1
it	1
is	1
called,”	1
replied	1
Pedro,	1
“but	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
he	1
knew	1
all	1
this	1
and	1
more	1
besides.	1
But,	1
to	1
make	1
an	1
end,	1
not	1
many	1
months	1
had	1
passed	1
after	1
he	1
returned	1
from	1
Salamanca,	1
when	1
one	1
day	1
he	1
appeared	1
dressed	1
as	1
a	1
shepherd	1
with	1
his	1
crook	1
and	1
sheepskin,	1
having	1
put	1
off	1
the	1
long	1
gown	1
he	1
wore	1
as	1
a	1
scholar;	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
his	1
great	1
friend,	1
Ambrosio	1
by	1
name,	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
his	1
companion	1
in	1
his	1
studies,	1
took	1
to	1
the	1
shepherd’s	1
dress	1
with	1
him.	1
I	1
forgot	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
Chrysostom,	1
who	1
is	1
dead,	1
was	1
a	1
great	1
man	1
for	1
writing	1
verses,	1
so	1
much	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
made	1
carols	1
for	1
Christmas	1
Eve,	1
and	1
plays	1
for	1
Corpus	1
Christi,	1
which	1
the	1
young	1
men	1
of	1
our	1
village	1
acted,	1
and	1
all	1
said	1
they	1
were	1
excellent.	1
When	1
the	1
villagers	1
saw	1
the	1
two	1
scholars	1
so	1
unexpectedly	1
appearing	1
in	1
shepherd’s	1
dress,	1
they	1
were	1
lost	1
in	1
wonder,	1
and	1
could	1
not	1
guess	1
what	1
had	1
led	1
them	1
to	1
make	1
so	1
extraordinary	1
a	1
change.	1
About	1
this	1
time	1
the	1
father	1
of	1
our	1
Chrysostom	1
died,	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
left	1
heir	1
to	1
a	1
large	1
amount	1
of	1
property	1
in	1
chattels	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
in	1
land,	1
no	1
small	1
number	1
of	1
cattle	1
and	1
sheep,	1
and	1
a	1
large	1
sum	1
of	1
money,	1
of	1
all	1
of	1
which	1
the	1
young	1
man	1
was	1
left	1
dissolute	1
owner,	1
and	1
indeed	1
he	1
was	1
deserving	1
of	1
it	1
all,	1
for	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
very	1
good	1
comrade,	1
and	1
kind-hearted,	1
and	1
a	1
friend	1
of	1
worthy	1
folk,	1
and	1
had	1
a	1
countenance	1
like	1
a	1
benediction.	1
Presently	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
be	1
known	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
changed	1
his	1
dress	1
with	1
no	1
other	1
object	1
than	1
to	1
wander	1
about	1
these	1
wastes	1
after	1
that	1
shepherdess	1
Marcela	1
our	1
lad	1
mentioned	1
a	1
while	1
ago,	1
with	1
whom	1
the	1
deceased	1
Chrysostom	1
had	1
fallen	1
in	1
love.	1
And	1
I	1
must	1
tell	1
you	1
now,	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
well	1
you	1
should	1
know	1
it,	1
who	1
this	1
girl	1
is;	1
perhaps,	1
and	1
even	1
without	1
any	1
perhaps,	1
you	1
will	1
not	1
have	1
heard	1
anything	1
like	1
it	1
all	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
your	1
life,	1
though	1
you	1
should	1
live	1
more	1
years	1
than	1
sarna.”	1
“Say	1
Sarra,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
unable	1
to	1
endure	1
the	1
goatherd’s	1
confusion	1
of	1
words.	1
“The	1
sarna	1
lives	1
long	1
enough,”	1
answered	1
Pedro;	1
“and	1
if,	1
señor,	1
you	1
must	1
go	1
finding	1
fault	1
with	1
words	1
at	1
every	1
step,	1
we	1
shall	1
not	1
make	1
an	1
end	1
of	1
it	1
this	1
twelvemonth.”	1
“Pardon	1
me,	1
friend,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
“but,	1
as	1
there	1
is	1
such	1
a	1
difference	1
between	1
sarna	1
and	1
Sarra,	1
I	1
told	1
you	1
of	1
it;	1
however,	1
you	1
have	1
answered	1
very	1
rightly,	1
for	1
sarna	1
lives	1
longer	1
than	1
Sarra:	1
so	1
continue	1
your	1
story,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
object	1
any	1
more	1
to	1
anything.”	1
“I	1
say	1
then,	1
my	1
dear	1
sir,”	1
said	1
the	1
goatherd,	1
“that	1
in	1
our	1
village	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
farmer	1
even	1
richer	1
than	1
the	1
father	1
of	1
Chrysostom,	1
who	1
was	1
named	1
Guillermo,	1
and	1
upon	1
whom	1
God	1
bestowed,	1
over	1
and	1
above	1
great	1
wealth,	1
a	1
daughter	1
at	1
whose	1
birth	1
her	1
mother	1
died,	1
the	1
most	1
respected	1
woman	1
there	1
was	1
in	1
this	1
neighbourhood;	1
I	1
fancy	1
I	1
can	1
see	1
her	1
now	1
with	1
that	1
countenance	1
which	1
had	1
the	1
sun	1
on	1
one	1
side	1
and	1
the	1
moon	1
on	1
the	1
other;	1
and	1
moreover	1
active,	1
and	1
kind	1
to	1
the	1
poor,	1
for	1
which	1
I	1
trust	1
that	1
at	1
the	1
present	1
moment	1
her	1
soul	1
is	1
in	1
bliss	1
with	1
God	1
in	1
the	1
other	1
world.	1
Her	1
husband	1
Guillermo	1
died	1
of	1
grief	1
at	1
the	1
death	1
of	1
so	1
good	1
a	1
wife,	1
leaving	1
his	1
daughter	1
Marcela,	1
a	1
child	1
and	1
rich,	1
to	1
the	1
care	1
of	1
an	1
uncle	1
of	1
hers,	1
a	1
priest	1
and	1
prebendary	1
in	1
our	1
village.	1
The	1
girl	1
grew	1
up	1
with	1
such	1
beauty	1
that	1
it	1
reminded	1
us	1
of	1
her	1
mother’s,	1
which	1
was	1
very	1
great,	1
and	1
yet	1
it	1
was	1
thought	1
that	1
the	1
daughter’s	1
would	1
exceed	1
it;	1
and	1
so	1
when	1
she	1
reached	1
the	1
age	1
of	1
fourteen	1
to	1
fifteen	1
years	1
nobody	1
beheld	1
her	1
but	1
blessed	1
God	1
that	1
had	1
made	1
her	1
so	1
beautiful,	1
and	1
the	1
greater	1
number	1
were	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
her	1
past	1
redemption.	1
Her	1
uncle	1
kept	1
her	1
in	1
great	1
seclusion	1
and	1
retirement,	1
but	1
for	1
all	1
that	1
the	1
fame	1
of	1
her	1
great	1
beauty	1
spread	1
so	1
that,	1
as	1
well	1
for	1
it	1
as	1
for	1
her	1
great	1
wealth,	1
her	1
uncle	1
was	1
asked,	1
solicited,	1
and	1
importuned,	1
to	1
give	1
her	1
in	1
marriage	1
not	1
only	1
by	1
those	1
of	1
our	1
town	1
but	1
of	1
those	1
many	1
leagues	1
round,	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
persons	1
of	1
highest	1
quality	1
in	1
them.	1
But	1
he,	1
being	1
a	1
good	1
Christian	1
man,	1
though	1
he	1
desired	1
to	1
give	1
her	1
in	1
marriage	1
at	1
once,	1
seeing	1
her	1
to	1
be	1
old	1
enough,	1
was	1
unwilling	1
to	1
do	1
so	1
without	1
her	1
consent,	1
not	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
any	1
eye	1
to	1
the	1
gain	1
and	1
profit	1
which	1
the	1
custody	1
of	1
the	1
girl’s	1
property	1
brought	1
him	1
while	1
he	1
put	1
off	1
her	1
marriage;	1
and,	1
faith,	1
this	1
was	1
said	1
in	1
praise	1
of	1
the	1
good	1
priest	1
in	1
more	1
than	1
one	1
set	1
in	1
the	1
town.	1
For	1
I	1
would	1
have	1
you	1
know,	1
Sir	1
Errant,	1
that	1
in	1
these	1
little	1
villages	1
everything	1
is	1
talked	1
about	1
and	1
everything	1
is	1
carped	1
at,	1
and	1
rest	1
assured,	1
as	1
I	1
am,	1
that	1
the	1
priest	1
must	1
be	1
over	1
and	1
above	1
good	1
who	1
forces	1
his	1
parishioners	1
to	1
speak	1
well	1
of	1
him,	1
especially	1
in	1
villages.”	1
“That	1
is	1
the	1
truth,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
“but	1
go	1
on,	1
for	1
the	1
story	1
is	1
very	1
good,	1
and	1
you,	1
good	1
Pedro,	1
tell	1
it	1
with	1
very	1
good	1
grace.”	1
“May	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
Lord	1
not	1
be	1
wanting	1
to	1
me,”	1
said	1
Pedro;	1
“that	1
is	1
the	1
one	1
to	1
have.	1
To	1
proceed;	1
you	1
must	1
know	1
that	1
though	1
the	1
uncle	1
put	1
before	1
his	1
niece	1
and	1
described	1
to	1
her	1
the	1
qualities	1
of	1
each	1
one	1
in	1
particular	1
of	1
the	1
many	1
who	1
had	1
asked	1
her	1
in	1
marriage,	1
begging	1
her	1
to	1
marry	1
and	1
make	1
a	1
choice	1
according	1
to	1
her	1
own	1
taste,	1
she	1
never	1
gave	1
any	1
other	1
answer	1
than	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
no	1
desire	1
to	1
marry	1
just	1
yet,	1
and	1
that	1
being	1
so	1
young	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
think	1
herself	1
fit	1
to	1
bear	1
the	1
burden	1
of	1
matrimony.	1
At	1
these,	1
to	1
all	1
appearance,	1
reasonable	1
excuses	1
that	1
she	1
made,	1
her	1
uncle	1
ceased	1
to	1
urge	1
her,	1
and	1
waited	1
till	1
she	1
was	1
somewhat	1
more	1
advanced	1
in	1
age	1
and	1
could	1
mate	1
herself	1
to	1
her	1
own	1
liking.	1
For,	1
said	1
he—and	1
he	1
said	1
quite	1
right—parents	1
are	1
not	1
to	1
settle	1
children	1
in	1
life	1
against	1
their	1
will.	1
But	1
when	1
one	1
least	1
looked	1
for	1
it,	1
lo	1
and	1
behold!	1
one	1
day	1
the	1
demure	1
Marcela	1
makes	1
her	1
appearance	1
turned	1
shepherdess;	1
and,	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
her	1
uncle	1
and	1
all	1
those	1
of	1
the	1
town	1
that	1
strove	1
to	1
dissuade	1
her,	1
took	1
to	1
going	1
a-field	1
with	1
the	1
other	1
shepherd-lasses	1
of	1
the	1
village,	1
and	1
tending	1
her	1
own	1
flock.	1
And	1
so,	1
since	1
she	1
appeared	1
in	1
public,	1
and	1
her	1
beauty	1
came	1
to	1
be	1
seen	1
openly,	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
well	1
tell	1
you	1
how	1
many	1
rich	1
youths,	1
gentlemen	1
and	1
peasants,	1
have	1
adopted	1
the	1
costume	1
of	1
Chrysostom,	1
and	1
go	1
about	1
these	1
fields	1
making	1
love	1
to	1
her.	1
One	1
of	1
these,	1
as	1
has	1
been	1
already	1
said,	1
was	1
our	1
deceased	1
friend,	1
of	1
whom	1
they	1
say	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
love	1
but	1
adore	1
her.	1
But	1
you	1
must	1
not	1
suppose,	1
because	1
Marcela	1
chose	1
a	1
life	1
of	1
such	1
liberty	1
and	1
independence,	1
and	1
of	1
so	1
little	1
or	1
rather	1
no	1
retirement,	1
that	1
she	1
has	1
given	1
any	1
occasion,	1
or	1
even	1
the	1
semblance	1
of	1
one,	1
for	1
disparagement	1
of	1
her	1
purity	1
and	1
modesty;	1
on	1
the	1
contrary,	1
such	1
and	1
so	1
great	1
is	1
the	1
vigilance	1
with	1
which	1
she	1
watches	1
over	1
her	1
honour,	1
that	1
of	1
all	1
those	1
that	1
court	1
and	1
woo	1
her	1
not	1
one	1
has	1
boasted,	1
or	1
can	1
with	1
truth	1
boast,	1
that	1
she	1
has	1
given	1
him	1
any	1
hope	1
however	1
small	1
of	1
obtaining	1
his	1
desire.	1
For	1
although	1
she	1
does	1
not	1
avoid	1
or	1
shun	1
the	1
society	1
and	1
conversation	1
of	1
the	1
shepherds,	1
and	1
treats	1
them	1
courteously	1
and	1
kindly,	1
should	1
any	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
come	1
to	1
declare	1
his	1
intention	1
to	1
her,	1
though	1
it	1
be	1
one	1
as	1
proper	1
and	1
holy	1
as	1
that	1
of	1
matrimony,	1
she	1
flings	1
him	1
from	1
her	1
like	1
a	1
catapult.	1
And	1
with	1
this	1
kind	1
of	1
disposition	1
she	1
does	1
more	1
harm	1
in	1
this	1
country	1
than	1
if	1
the	1
plague	1
had	1
got	1
into	1
it,	1
for	1
her	1
affability	1
and	1
her	1
beauty	1
draw	1
on	1
the	1
hearts	1
of	1
those	1
that	1
associate	1
with	1
her	1
to	1
love	1
her	1
and	1
to	1
court	1
her,	1
but	1
her	1
scorn	1
and	1
her	1
frankness	1
bring	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
brink	1
of	1
despair;	1
and	1
so	1
they	1
know	1
not	1
what	1
to	1
say	1
save	1
to	1
proclaim	1
her	1
aloud	1
cruel	1
and	1
hard-hearted,	1
and	1
other	1
names	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
sort	1
which	1
well	1
describe	1
the	1
nature	1
of	1
her	1
character;	1
and	1
if	1
you	1
should	1
remain	1
here	1
any	1
time,	1
señor,	1
you	1
would	1
hear	1
these	1
hills	1
and	1
valleys	1
resounding	1
with	1
the	1
laments	1
of	1
the	1
rejected	1
ones	1
who	1
pursue	1
her.	1
Not	1
far	1
from	1
this	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
spot	1
where	1
there	1
are	1
a	1
couple	1
of	1
dozen	1
of	1
tall	1
beeches,	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
not	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
but	1
has	1
carved	1
and	1
written	1
on	1
its	1
smooth	1
bark	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Marcela,	1
and	1
above	1
some	1
a	1
crown	1
carved	1
on	1
the	1
same	1
tree	1
as	1
though	1
her	1
lover	1
would	1
say	1
more	1
plainly	1
that	1
Marcela	1
wore	1
and	1
deserved	1
that	1
of	1
all	1
human	1
beauty.	1
Here	1
one	1
shepherd	1
is	1
sighing,	1
there	1
another	1
is	1
lamenting;	1
there	1
love	1
songs	1
are	1
heard,	1
here	1
despairing	1
elegies.	1
One	1
will	1
pass	1
all	1
the	1
hours	1
of	1
the	1
night	1
seated	1
at	1
the	1
foot	1
of	1
some	1
oak	1
or	1
rock,	1
and	1
there,	1
without	1
having	1
closed	1
his	1
weeping	1
eyes,	1
the	1
sun	1
finds	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
bemused	1
and	1
bereft	1
of	1
sense;	1
and	1
another	1
without	1
relief	1
or	1
respite	1
to	1
his	1
sighs,	1
stretched	1
on	1
the	1
burning	1
sand	1
in	1
the	1
full	1
heat	1
of	1
the	1
sultry	1
summer	1
noontide,	1
makes	1
his	1
appeal	1
to	1
the	1
compassionate	1
heavens,	1
and	1
over	1
one	1
and	1
the	1
other,	1
over	1
these	1
and	1
all,	1
the	1
beautiful	1
Marcela	1
triumphs	1
free	1
and	1
careless.	1
And	1
all	1
of	1
us	1
that	1
know	1
her	1
are	1
waiting	1
to	1
see	1
what	1
her	1
pride	1
will	1
come	1
to,	1
and	1
who	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
happy	1
man	1
that	1
will	1
succeed	1
in	1
taming	1
a	1
nature	1
so	1
formidable	1
and	1
gaining	1
possession	1
of	1
a	1
beauty	1
so	1
supreme.	1
All	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
told	1
you	1
being	1
such	1
well-established	1
truth,	1
I	1
am	1
persuaded	1
that	1
what	1
they	1
say	1
of	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
Chrysostom’s	1
death,	1
as	1
our	1
lad	1
told	1
us,	1
is	1
the	1
same.	1
And	1
so	1
I	1
advise	1
you,	1
señor,	1
fail	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
present	1
to-morrow	1
at	1
his	1
burial,	1
which	1
will	1
be	1
well	1
worth	1
seeing,	1
for	1
Chrysostom	1
had	1
many	1
friends,	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
half	1
a	1
league	1
from	1
this	1
place	1
to	1
where	1
he	1
directed	1
he	1
should	1
be	1
buried.”	1
“I	1
will	1
make	1
a	1
point	1
of	1
it,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“and	1
I	1
thank	1
you	1
for	1
the	1
pleasure	1
you	1
have	1
given	1
me	1
by	1
relating	1
so	1
interesting	1
a	1
tale.”	1
“Oh,”	1
said	1
the	1
goatherd,	1
“I	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
even	1
the	1
half	1
of	1
what	1
has	1
happened	1
to	1
the	1
lovers	1
of	1
Marcela,	1
but	1
perhaps	1
to-morrow	1
we	1
may	1
fall	1
in	1
with	1
some	1
shepherd	1
on	1
the	1
road	1
who	1
can	1
tell	1
us;	1
and	1
now	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
well	1
for	1
you	1
to	1
go	1
and	1
sleep	1
under	1
cover,	1
for	1
the	1
night	1
air	1
may	1
hurt	1
your	1
wound,	1
though	1
with	1
the	1
remedy	1
I	1
have	1
applied	1
to	1
you	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
fear	1
of	1
an	1
untoward	1
result.”	1
Sancho	1
Panza,	1
who	1
was	1
wishing	1
the	1
goatherd’s	1
loquacity	1
at	1
the	1
devil,	1
on	1
his	1
part	1
begged	1
his	1
master	1
to	1
go	1
into	1
Pedro’s	1
hut	1
to	1
sleep.	1
He	1
did	1
so,	1
and	1
passed	1
all	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
night	1
in	1
thinking	1
of	1
his	1
lady	1
Dulcinea,	1
in	1
imitation	1
of	1
the	1
lovers	1
of	1
Marcela.	1
Sancho	1
Panza	1
settled	1
himself	1
between	1
Rocinante	1
and	1
his	1
ass,	1
and	1
slept,	1
not	1
like	1
a	1
lover	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
discarded,	1
but	1
like	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
soundly	1
kicked.	1

But	1
hardly	1
had	1
day	1
begun	1
to	1
show	1
itself	1
through	1
the	1
balconies	1
of	1
the	1
east,	1
when	1
five	1
of	1
the	1
six	1
goatherds	1
came	1
to	1
rouse	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
and	1
tell	1
him	1
that	1
if	1
he	1
was	1
still	1
of	1
a	1
mind	1
to	1
go	1
and	1
see	1
the	1
famous	1
burial	1
of	1
Chrysostom	1
they	1
would	1
bear	1
him	1
company.	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
who	1
desired	1
nothing	1
better,	1
rose	1
and	1
ordered	1
Sancho	1
to	1
saddle	1
and	1
pannel	1
at	1
once,	1
which	1
he	1
did	1
with	1
all	1
despatch,	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
they	1
all	1
set	1
out	1
forthwith.	1
They	1
had	1
not	1
gone	1
a	1
quarter	1
of	1
a	1
league	1
when	1
at	1
the	1
meeting	1
of	1
two	1
paths	1
they	1
saw	1
coming	1
towards	1
them	1
some	1
six	1
shepherds	1
dressed	1
in	1
black	1
sheepskins	1
and	1
with	1
their	1
heads	1
crowned	1
with	1
garlands	1
of	1
cypress	1
and	1
bitter	1
oleander.	1
Each	1
of	1
them	1
carried	1
a	1
stout	1
holly	1
staff	1
in	1
his	1
hand,	1
and	1
along	1
with	1
them	1
there	1
came	1
two	1
men	1
of	1
quality	1
on	1
horseback	1
in	1
handsome	1
travelling	1
dress,	1
with	1
three	1
servants	1
on	1
foot	1
accompanying	1
them.	1
Courteous	1
salutations	1
were	1
exchanged	1
on	1
meeting,	1
and	1
inquiring	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
other	1
which	1
way	1
each	1
party	1
was	1
going,	1
they	1
learned	1
that	1
all	1
were	1
bound	1
for	1
the	1
scene	1
of	1
the	1
burial,	1
so	1
they	1
went	1
on	1
all	1
together.	1
One	1
of	1
those	1
on	1
horseback	1
addressing	1
his	1
companion	1
said	1
to	1
him,	1
“It	1
seems	1
to	1
me,	1
Señor	1
Vivaldo,	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
reckon	1
as	1
well	1
spent	1
the	1
delay	1
we	1
shall	1
incur	1
in	1
seeing	1
this	1
remarkable	1
funeral,	1
for	1
remarkable	1
it	1
cannot	1
but	1
be	1
judging	1
by	1
the	1
strange	1
things	1
these	1
shepherds	1
have	1
told	1
us,	1
of	1
both	1
the	1
dead	1
shepherd	1
and	1
homicide	1
shepherdess.”	1
“So	1
I	1
think	1
too,”	1
replied	1
Vivaldo,	1
“and	1
I	1
would	1
delay	1
not	1
to	1
say	1
a	1
day,	1
but	1
four,	1
for	1
the	1
sake	1
of	1
seeing	1
it.”	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
asked	1
them	1
what	1
it	1
was	1
they	1
had	1
heard	1
of	1
Marcela	1
and	1
Chrysostom.	1
The	1
traveller	1
answered	1
that	1
the	1
same	1
morning	1
they	1
had	1
met	1
these	1
shepherds,	1
and	1
seeing	1
them	1
dressed	1
in	1
this	1
mournful	1
fashion	1
they	1
had	1
asked	1
them	1
the	1
reason	1
of	1
their	1
appearing	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
guise;	1
which	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
gave,	1
describing	1
the	1
strange	1
behaviour	1
and	1
beauty	1
of	1
a	1
shepherdess	1
called	1
Marcela,	1
and	1
the	1
loves	1
of	1
many	1
who	1
courted	1
her,	1
together	1
with	1
the	1
death	1
of	1
that	1
Chrysostom	1
to	1
whose	1
burial	1
they	1
were	1
going.	1
In	1
short,	1
he	1
repeated	1
all	1
that	1
Pedro	1
had	1
related	1
to	1
Don	1
Quixote.	1
This	1
conversation	1
dropped,	1
and	1
another	1
was	1
commenced	1
by	1
him	1
who	1
was	1
called	1
Vivaldo	1
asking	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
what	1
was	1
the	1
reason	1
that	1
led	1
him	1
to	1
go	1
armed	1
in	1
that	1
fashion	1
in	1
a	1
country	1
so	1
peaceful.	1
To	1
which	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
replied,	1
“The	1
pursuit	1
of	1
my	1
calling	1
does	1
not	1
allow	1
or	1
permit	1
me	1
to	1
go	1
in	1
any	1
other	1
fashion;	1
easy	1
life,	1
enjoyment,	1
and	1
repose	1
were	1
invented	1
for	1
soft	1
courtiers,	1
but	1
toil,	1
unrest,	1
and	1
arms	1
were	1
invented	1
and	1
made	1
for	1
those	1
alone	1
whom	1
the	1
world	1
calls	1
knights-errant,	1
of	1
whom	1
I,	1
though	1
unworthy,	1
am	1
the	1
least	1
of	1
all.”	1
The	1
instant	1
they	1
heard	1
this	1
all	1
set	1
him	1
down	1
as	1
mad,	1
and	1
the	1
better	1
to	1
settle	1
the	1
point	1
and	1
discover	1
what	1
kind	1
of	1
madness	1
his	1
was,	1
Vivaldo	1
proceeded	1
to	1
ask	1
him	1
what	1
knights-errant	1
meant.	1
“Have	1
not	1
your	1
worships,”	1
replied	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“read	1
the	1
annals	1
and	1
histories	1
of	1
England,	1
in	1
which	1
are	1
recorded	1
the	1
famous	1
deeds	1
of	1
King	1
Arthur,	1
whom	1
we	1
in	1
our	1
popular	1
Castilian	1
invariably	1
call	1
King	1
Artus,	1
with	1
regard	1
to	1
whom	1
it	1
is	1
an	1
ancient	1
tradition,	1
and	1
commonly	1
received	1
all	1
over	1
that	1
kingdom	1
of	1
Great	1
Britain,	1
that	1
this	1
king	1
did	1
not	1
die,	1
but	1
was	1
changed	1
by	1
magic	1
art	1
into	1
a	1
raven,	1
and	1
that	1
in	1
process	1
of	1
time	1
he	1
is	1
to	1
return	1
to	1
reign	1
and	1
recover	1
his	1
kingdom	1
and	1
sceptre;	1
for	1
which	1
reason	1
it	1
cannot	1
be	1
proved	1
that	1
from	1
that	1
time	1
to	1
this	1
any	1
Englishman	1
ever	1
killed	1
a	1
raven?	1
Well,	1
then,	1
in	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
this	1
good	1
king	1
that	1
famous	1
order	1
of	1
chivalry	1
of	1
the	1
Knights	1
of	1
the	1
Round	1
Table	1
was	1
instituted,	1
and	1
the	1
amour	1
of	1
Don	1
Lancelot	1
of	1
the	1
Lake	1
with	1
the	1
Queen	1
Guinevere	1
occurred,	1
precisely	1
as	1
is	1
there	1
related,	1
the	1
go-between	1
and	1
confidante	1
therein	1
being	1
the	1
highly	1
honourable	1
dame	1
Quintañona,	1
whence	1
came	1
that	1
ballad	1
so	1
well	1
known	1
and	1
widely	1
spread	1
in	1
our	1
Spain—	1
O	1
never	1
surely	1
was	1
there	1
knight	1
So	1
served	1
by	1
hand	1
of	1
dame,	1
As	1
served	1
was	1
he	1
Sir	1
Lancelot	1
hight	1
When	1
he	1
from	1
Britain	1
came—	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
sweet	1
and	1
delectable	1
course	1
of	1
his	1
achievements	1
in	1
love	1
and	1
war.	1
Handed	1
down	1
from	1
that	1
time,	1
then,	1
this	1
order	1
of	1
chivalry	1
went	1
on	1
extending	1
and	1
spreading	1
itself	1
over	1
many	1
and	1
various	1
parts	1
of	1
the	1
world;	1
and	1
in	1
it,	1
famous	1
and	1
renowned	1
for	1
their	1
deeds,	1
were	1
the	1
mighty	1
Amadis	1
of	1
Gaul	1
with	1
all	1
his	1
sons	1
and	1
descendants	1
to	1
the	1
fifth	1
generation,	1
and	1
the	1
valiant	1
Felixmarte	1
of	1
Hircania,	1
and	1
the	1
never	1
sufficiently	1
praised	1
Tirante	1
el	1
Blanco,	1
and	1
in	1
our	1
own	1
days	1
almost	1
we	1
have	1
seen	1
and	1
heard	1
and	1
talked	1
with	1
the	1
invincible	1
knight	1
Don	1
Belianis	1
of	1
Greece.	1
This,	1
then,	1
sirs,	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
knight-errant,	1
and	1
what	1
I	1
have	1
spoken	1
of	1
is	1
the	1
order	1
of	1
his	1
chivalry,	1
of	1
which,	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
already	1
said,	1
I,	1
though	1
a	1
sinner,	1
have	1
made	1
profession,	1
and	1
what	1
the	1
aforesaid	1
knights	1
professed	1
that	1
same	1
do	1
I	1
profess,	1
and	1
so	1
I	1
go	1
through	1
these	1
solitudes	1
and	1
wilds	1
seeking	1
adventures,	1
resolved	1
in	1
soul	1
to	1
oppose	1
my	1
arm	1
and	1
person	1
to	1
the	1
most	1
perilous	1
that	1
fortune	1
may	1
offer	1
me	1
in	1
aid	1
of	1
the	1
weak	1
and	1
needy.”	1
By	1
these	1
words	1
of	1
his	1
the	1
travellers	1
were	1
able	1
to	1
satisfy	1
themselves	1
of	1
Don	1
Quixote’s	1
being	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
senses	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
form	1
of	1
madness	1
that	1
overmastered	1
him,	1
at	1
which	1
they	1
felt	1
the	1
same	1
astonishment	1
that	1
all	1
felt	1
on	1
first	1
becoming	1
acquainted	1
with	1
it;	1
and	1
Vivaldo,	1
who	1
was	1
a	1
person	1
of	1
great	1
shrewdness	1
and	1
of	1
a	1
lively	1
temperament,	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
beguile	1
the	1
short	1
journey	1
which	1
they	1
said	1
was	1
required	1
to	1
reach	1
the	1
mountain,	1
the	1
scene	1
of	1
the	1
burial,	1
sought	1
to	1
give	1
him	1
an	1
opportunity	1
of	1
going	1
on	1
with	1
his	1
absurdities.	1
So	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
him,	1
“It	1
seems	1
to	1
me,	1
Señor	1
Knight-errant,	1
that	1
your	1
worship	1
has	1
made	1
choice	1
of	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
austere	1
professions	1
in	1
the	1
world,	1
and	1
I	1
imagine	1
even	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
Carthusian	1
monks	1
is	1
not	1
so	1
austere.”	1
“As	1
austere	1
it	1
may	1
perhaps	1
be,”	1
replied	1
our	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“but	1
so	1
necessary	1
for	1
the	1
world	1
I	1
am	1
very	1
much	1
inclined	1
to	1
doubt.	1
For,	1
if	1
the	1
truth	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
told,	1
the	1
soldier	1
who	1
executes	1
what	1
his	1
captain	1
orders	1
does	1
no	1
less	1
than	1
the	1
captain	1
himself	1
who	1
gives	1
the	1
order.	1
My	1
meaning,	1
is,	1
that	1
churchmen	1
in	1
peace	1
and	1
quiet	1
pray	1
to	1
Heaven	1
for	1
the	1
welfare	1
of	1
the	1
world,	1
but	1
we	1
soldiers	1
and	1
knights	1
carry	1
into	1
effect	1
what	1
they	1
pray	1
for,	1
defending	1
it	1
with	1
the	1
might	1
of	1
our	1
arms	1
and	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
our	1
swords,	1
not	1
under	1
shelter	1
but	1
in	1
the	1
open	1
air,	1
a	1
target	1
for	1
the	1
intolerable	1
rays	1
of	1
the	1
sun	1
in	1
summer	1
and	1
the	1
piercing	1
frosts	1
of	1
winter.	1
Thus	1
are	1
we	1
God’s	1
ministers	1
on	1
earth	1
and	1
the	1
arms	1
by	1
which	1
his	1
justice	1
is	1
done	1
therein.	1
And	1
as	1
the	1
business	1
of	1
war	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
relates	1
and	1
belongs	1
to	1
it	1
cannot	1
be	1
conducted	1
without	1
exceeding	1
great	1
sweat,	1
toil,	1
and	1
exertion,	1
it	1
follows	1
that	1
those	1
who	1
make	1
it	1
their	1
profession	1
have	1
undoubtedly	1
more	1
labour	1
than	1
those	1
who	1
in	1
tranquil	1
peace	1
and	1
quiet	1
are	1
engaged	1
in	1
praying	1
to	1
God	1
to	1
help	1
the	1
weak.	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
mean	1
to	1
say,	1
nor	1
does	1
it	1
enter	1
into	1
my	1
thoughts,	1
that	1
the	1
knight-errant’s	1
calling	1
is	1
as	1
good	1
as	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
monk	1
in	1
his	1
cell;	1
I	1
would	1
merely	1
infer	1
from	1
what	1
I	1
endure	1
myself	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
beyond	1
a	1
doubt	1
a	1
more	1
laborious	1
and	1
a	1
more	1
belaboured	1
one,	1
a	1
hungrier	1
and	1
thirstier,	1
a	1
wretcheder,	1
raggeder,	1
and	1
lousier;	1
for	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
reason	1
to	1
doubt	1
that	1
the	1
knights-errant	1
of	1
yore	1
endured	1
much	1
hardship	1
in	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
their	1
lives.	1
And	1
if	1
some	1
of	1
them	1
by	1
the	1
might	1
of	1
their	1
arms	1
did	1
rise	1
to	1
be	1
emperors,	1
in	1
faith	1
it	1
cost	1
them	1
dear	1
in	1
the	1
matter	1
of	1
blood	1
and	1
sweat;	1
and	1
if	1
those	1
who	1
attained	1
to	1
that	1
rank	1
had	1
not	1
had	1
magicians	1
and	1
sages	1
to	1
help	1
them	1
they	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
completely	1
baulked	1
in	1
their	1
ambition	1
and	1
disappointed	1
in	1
their	1
hopes.”	1
“That	1
is	1
my	1
own	1
opinion,”	1
replied	1
the	1
traveller;	1
“but	1
one	1
thing	1
among	1
many	1
others	1
seems	1
to	1
me	1
very	1
wrong	1
in	1
knights-errant,	1
and	1
that	1
is	1
that	1
when	1
they	1
find	1
themselves	1
about	1
to	1
engage	1
in	1
some	1
mighty	1
and	1
perilous	1
adventure	1
in	1
which	1
there	1
is	1
manifest	1
danger	1
of	1
losing	1
their	1
lives,	1
they	1
never	1
at	1
the	1
moment	1
of	1
engaging	1
in	1
it	1
think	1
of	1
commending	1
themselves	1
to	1
God,	1
as	1
is	1
the	1
duty	1
of	1
every	1
good	1
Christian	1
in	1
like	1
peril;	1
instead	1
of	1
which	1
they	1
commend	1
themselves	1
to	1
their	1
ladies	1
with	1
as	1
much	1
devotion	1
as	1
if	1
these	1
were	1
their	1
gods,	1
a	1
thing	1
which	1
seems	1
to	1
me	1
to	1
savour	1
somewhat	1
of	1
heathenism.”	1
“Sir,”	1
answered	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“that	1
cannot	1
be	1
on	1
any	1
account	1
omitted,	1
and	1
the	1
knight-errant	1
would	1
be	1
disgraced	1
who	1
acted	1
otherwise:	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
usual	1
and	1
customary	1
in	1
knight-errantry	1
that	1
the	1
knight-errant,	1
who	1
on	1
engaging	1
in	1
any	1
great	1
feat	1
of	1
arms	1
has	1
his	1
lady	1
before	1
him,	1
should	1
turn	1
his	1
eyes	1
towards	1
her	1
softly	1
and	1
lovingly,	1
as	1
though	1
with	1
them	1
entreating	1
her	1
to	1
favour	1
and	1
protect	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
hazardous	1
venture	1
he	1
is	1
about	1
to	1
undertake,	1
and	1
even	1
though	1
no	1
one	1
hear	1
him,	1
he	1
is	1
bound	1
to	1
say	1
certain	1
words	1
between	1
his	1
teeth,	1
commending	1
himself	1
to	1
her	1
with	1
all	1
his	1
heart,	1
and	1
of	1
this	1
we	1
have	1
innumerable	1
instances	1
in	1
the	1
histories.	1
Nor	1
is	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
supposed	1
from	1
this	1
that	1
they	1
are	1
to	1
omit	1
commending	1
themselves	1
to	1
God,	1
for	1
there	1
will	1
be	1
time	1
and	1
opportunity	1
for	1
doing	1
so	1
while	1
they	1
are	1
engaged	1
in	1
their	1
task.”	1
“For	1
all	1
that,”	1
answered	1
the	1
traveller,	1
“I	1
feel	1
some	1
doubt	1
still,	1
because	1
often	1
I	1
have	1
read	1
how	1
words	1
will	1
arise	1
between	1
two	1
knights-errant,	1
and	1
from	1
one	1
thing	1
to	1
another	1
it	1
comes	1
about	1
that	1
their	1
anger	1
kindles	1
and	1
they	1
wheel	1
their	1
horses	1
round	1
and	1
take	1
a	1
good	1
stretch	1
of	1
field,	1
and	1
then	1
without	1
any	1
more	1
ado	1
at	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
their	1
speed	1
they	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
charge,	1
and	1
in	1
mid-career	1
they	1
are	1
wont	1
to	1
commend	1
themselves	1
to	1
their	1
ladies;	1
and	1
what	1
commonly	1
comes	1
of	1
the	1
encounter	1
is	1
that	1
one	1
falls	1
over	1
the	1
haunches	1
of	1
his	1
horse	1
pierced	1
through	1
and	1
through	1
by	1
his	1
antagonist’s	1
lance,	1
and	1
as	1
for	1
the	1
other,	1
it	1
is	1
only	1
by	1
holding	1
on	1
to	1
the	1
mane	1
of	1
his	1
horse	1
that	1
he	1
can	1
help	1
falling	1
to	1
the	1
ground;	1
but	1
I	1
know	1
not	1
how	1
the	1
dead	1
man	1
had	1
time	1
to	1
commend	1
himself	1
to	1
God	1
in	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
such	1
rapid	1
work	1
as	1
this;	1
it	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
better	1
if	1
those	1
words	1
which	1
he	1
spent	1
in	1
commending	1
himself	1
to	1
his	1
lady	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
his	1
career	1
had	1
been	1
devoted	1
to	1
his	1
duty	1
and	1
obligation	1
as	1
a	1
Christian.	1
Moreover,	1
it	1
is	1
my	1
belief	1
that	1
all	1
knights-errant	1
have	1
not	1
ladies	1
to	1
commend	1
themselves	1
to,	1
for	1
they	1
are	1
not	1
all	1
in	1
love.”	1
“That	1
is	1
impossible,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote:	1
“I	1
say	1
it	1
is	1
impossible	1
that	1
there	1
could	1
be	1
a	1
knight-errant	1
without	1
a	1
lady,	1
because	1
to	1
such	1
it	1
is	1
as	1
natural	1
and	1
proper	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
love	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
heavens	1
to	1
have	1
stars:	1
most	1
certainly	1
no	1
history	1
has	1
been	1
seen	1
in	1
which	1
there	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
found	1
a	1
knight-errant	1
without	1
an	1
amour,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
simple	1
reason	1
that	1
without	1
one	1
he	1
would	1
be	1
held	1
no	1
legitimate	1
knight	1
but	1
a	1
bastard,	1
and	1
one	1
who	1
had	1
gained	1
entrance	1
into	1
the	1
stronghold	1
of	1
the	1
said	1
knighthood,	1
not	1
by	1
the	1
door,	1
but	1
over	1
the	1
wall	1
like	1
a	1
thief	1
and	1
a	1
robber.”	1
“Nevertheless,”	1
said	1
the	1
traveller,	1
“if	1
I	1
remember	1
rightly,	1
I	1
think	1
I	1
have	1
read	1
that	1
Don	1
Galaor,	1
the	1
brother	1
of	1
the	1
valiant	1
Amadis	1
of	1
Gaul,	1
never	1
had	1
any	1
special	1
lady	1
to	1
whom	1
he	1
might	1
commend	1
himself,	1
and	1
yet	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
the	1
less	1
esteemed,	1
and	1
was	1
a	1
very	1
stout	1
and	1
famous	1
knight.”	1
To	1
which	1
our	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
made	1
answer,	1
“Sir,	1
one	1
solitary	1
swallow	1
does	1
not	1
make	1
summer;	1
moreover,	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
knight	1
was	1
in	1
secret	1
very	1
deeply	1
in	1
love;	1
besides	1
which,	1
that	1
way	1
of	1
falling	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
all	1
that	1
took	1
his	1
fancy	1
was	1
a	1
natural	1
propensity	1
which	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
control.	1
But,	1
in	1
short,	1
it	1
is	1
very	1
manifest	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
one	1
alone	1
whom	1
he	1
made	1
mistress	1
of	1
his	1
will,	1
to	1
whom	1
he	1
commended	1
himself	1
very	1
frequently	1
and	1
very	1
secretly,	1
for	1
he	1
prided	1
himself	1
on	1
being	1
a	1
reticent	1
knight.”	1
“Then	1
if	1
it	1
be	1
essential	1
that	1
every	1
knight-errant	1
should	1
be	1
in	1
love,”	1
said	1
the	1
traveller,	1
“it	1
may	1
be	1
fairly	1
supposed	1
that	1
your	1
worship	1
is	1
so,	1
as	1
you	1
are	1
of	1
the	1
order;	1
and	1
if	1
you	1
do	1
not	1
pride	1
yourself	1
on	1
being	1
as	1
reticent	1
as	1
Don	1
Galaor,	1
I	1
entreat	1
you	1
as	1
earnestly	1
as	1
I	1
can,	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
all	1
this	1
company	1
and	1
in	1
my	1
own,	1
to	1
inform	1
us	1
of	1
the	1
name,	1
country,	1
rank,	1
and	1
beauty	1
of	1
your	1
lady,	1
for	1
she	1
will	1
esteem	1
herself	1
fortunate	1
if	1
all	1
the	1
world	1
knows	1
that	1
she	1
is	1
loved	1
and	1
served	1
by	1
such	1
a	1
knight	1
as	1
your	1
worship	1
seems	1
to	1
be.”	1
At	1
this	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
heaved	1
a	1
deep	1
sigh	1
and	1
said,	1
“I	1
cannot	1
say	1
positively	1
whether	1
my	1
sweet	1
enemy	1
is	1
pleased	1
or	1
not	1
that	1
the	1
world	1
should	1
know	1
I	1
serve	1
her;	1
I	1
can	1
only	1
say	1
in	1
answer	1
to	1
what	1
has	1
been	1
so	1
courteously	1
asked	1
of	1
me,	1
that	1
her	1
name	1
is	1
Dulcinea,	1
her	1
country	1
El	1
Toboso,	1
a	1
village	1
of	1
La	1
Mancha,	1
her	1
rank	1
must	1
be	1
at	1
least	1
that	1
of	1
a	1
princess,	1
since	1
she	1
is	1
my	1
queen	1
and	1
lady,	1
and	1
her	1
beauty	1
superhuman,	1
since	1
all	1
the	1
impossible	1
and	1
fanciful	1
attributes	1
of	1
beauty	1
which	1
the	1
poets	1
apply	1
to	1
their	1
ladies	1
are	1
verified	1
in	1
her;	1
for	1
her	1
hairs	1
are	1
gold,	1
her	1
forehead	1
Elysian	1
fields,	1
her	1
eyebrows	1
rainbows,	1
her	1
eyes	1
suns,	1
her	1
cheeks	1
roses,	1
her	1
lips	1
coral,	1
her	1
teeth	1
pearls,	1
her	1
neck	1
alabaster,	1
her	1
bosom	1
marble,	1
her	1
hands	1
ivory,	1
her	1
fairness	1
snow,	1
and	1
what	1
modesty	1
conceals	1
from	1
sight	1
such,	1
I	1
think	1
and	1
imagine,	1
as	1
rational	1
reflection	1
can	1
only	1
extol,	1
not	1
compare.”	1
“We	1
should	1
like	1
to	1
know	1
her	1
lineage,	1
race,	1
and	1
ancestry,”	1
said	1
Vivaldo.	1
To	1
which	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
replied,	1
“She	1
is	1
not	1
of	1
the	1
ancient	1
Roman	1
Curtii,	1
Caii,	1
or	1
Scipios,	1
nor	1
of	1
the	1
modern	1
Colonnas	1
or	1
Orsini,	1
nor	1
of	1
the	1
Moncadas	1
or	1
Requesenes	1
of	1
Catalonia,	1
nor	1
yet	1
of	1
the	1
Rebellas	1
or	1
Villanovas	1
of	1
Valencia;	1
Palafoxes,	1
Nuzas,	1
Rocabertis,	1
Corellas,	1
Lunas,	1
Alagones,	1
Urreas,	1
Foces,	1
or	1
Gurreas	1
of	1
Aragon;	1
Cerdas,	1
Manriques,	1
Mendozas,	1
or	1
Guzmans	1
of	1
Castile;	1
Alencastros,	1
Pallas,	1
or	1
Meneses	1
of	1
Portugal;	1
but	1
she	1
is	1
of	1
those	1
of	1
El	1
Toboso	1
of	1
La	1
Mancha,	1
a	1
lineage	1
that	1
though	1
modern,	1
may	1
furnish	1
a	1
source	1
of	1
gentle	1
blood	1
for	1
the	1
most	1
illustrious	1
families	1
of	1
the	1
ages	1
that	1
are	1
to	1
come,	1
and	1
this	1
let	1
none	1
dispute	1
with	1
me	1
save	1
on	1
the	1
condition	1
that	1
Zerbino	1
placed	1
at	1
the	1
foot	1
of	1
the	1
trophy	1
of	1
Orlando’s	1
arms,	1
saying,	1
These	1
let	1
none	1
move	1
Who	1
dareth	1
not	1
his	1
might	1
with	1
Roland	1
prove.”	1
“Although	1
mine	1
is	1
of	1
the	1
Cachopins	1
of	1
Laredo,”	1
said	1
the	1
traveller,	1
“I	1
will	1
not	1
venture	1
to	1
compare	1
it	1
with	1
that	1
of	1
El	1
Toboso	1
of	1
La	1
Mancha,	1
though,	1
to	1
tell	1
the	1
truth,	1
no	1
such	1
surname	1
has	1
until	1
now	1
ever	1
reached	1
my	1
ears.”	1
“What!”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“has	1
that	1
never	1
reached	1
them?”	1
The	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
party	1
went	1
along	1
listening	1
with	1
great	1
attention	1
to	1
the	1
conversation	1
of	1
the	1
pair,	1
and	1
even	1
the	1
very	1
goatherds	1
and	1
shepherds	1
perceived	1
how	1
exceedingly	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
wits	1
our	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
was.	1
Sancho	1
Panza	1
alone	1
thought	1
that	1
what	1
his	1
master	1
said	1
was	1
the	1
truth,	1
knowing	1
who	1
he	1
was	1
and	1
having	1
known	1
him	1
from	1
his	1
birth;	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
he	1
felt	1
any	1
difficulty	1
in	1
believing	1
was	1
that	1
about	1
the	1
fair	1
Dulcinea	1
del	1
Toboso,	1
because	1
neither	1
any	1
such	1
name	1
nor	1
any	1
such	1
princess	1
had	1
ever	1
come	1
to	1
his	1
knowledge	1
though	1
he	1
lived	1
so	1
close	1
to	1
El	1
Toboso.	1
They	1
were	1
going	1
along	1
conversing	1
in	1
this	1
way,	1
when	1
they	1
saw	1
descending	1
a	1
gap	1
between	1
two	1
high	1
mountains	1
some	1
twenty	1
shepherds,	1
all	1
clad	1
in	1
sheepskins	1
of	1
black	1
wool,	1
and	1
crowned	1
with	1
garlands	1
which,	1
as	1
afterwards	1
appeared,	1
were,	1
some	1
of	1
them	1
of	1
yew,	1
some	1
of	1
cypress.	1
Six	1
of	1
the	1
number	1
were	1
carrying	1
a	1
bier	1
covered	1
with	1
a	1
great	1
variety	1
of	1
flowers	1
and	1
branches,	1
on	1
seeing	1
which	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
goatherds	1
said,	1
“Those	1
who	1
come	1
there	1
are	1
the	1
bearers	1
of	1
Chrysostom’s	1
body,	1
and	1
the	1
foot	1
of	1
that	1
mountain	1
is	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
he	1
ordered	1
them	1
to	1
bury	1
him.”	1
They	1
therefore	1
made	1
haste	1
to	1
reach	1
the	1
spot,	1
and	1
did	1
so	1
by	1
the	1
time	1
those	1
who	1
came	1
had	1
laid	1
the	1
bier	1
upon	1
the	1
ground,	1
and	1
four	1
of	1
them	1
with	1
sharp	1
pickaxes	1
were	1
digging	1
a	1
grave	1
by	1
the	1
side	1
of	1
a	1
hard	1
rock.	1
They	1
greeted	1
each	1
other	1
courteously,	1
and	1
then	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
and	1
those	1
who	1
accompanied	1
him	1
turned	1
to	1
examine	1
the	1
bier,	1
and	1
on	1
it,	1
covered	1
with	1
flowers,	1
they	1
saw	1
a	1
dead	1
body	1
in	1
the	1
dress	1
of	1
a	1
shepherd,	1
to	1
all	1
appearance	1
of	1
one	1
thirty	1
years	1
of	1
age,	1
and	1
showing	1
even	1
in	1
death	1
that	1
in	1
life	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
of	1
comely	1
features	1
and	1
gallant	1
bearing.	1
Around	1
him	1
on	1
the	1
bier	1
itself	1
were	1
laid	1
some	1
books,	1
and	1
several	1
papers	1
open	1
and	1
folded;	1
and	1
those	1
who	1
were	1
looking	1
on	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
those	1
who	1
were	1
opening	1
the	1
grave	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
others	1
who	1
were	1
there	1
preserved	1
a	1
strange	1
silence,	1
until	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
had	1
borne	1
the	1
body	1
said	1
to	1
another,	1
“Observe	1
carefully,	1
Ambrosia	1
if	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
place	1
Chrysostom	1
spoke	1
of,	1
since	1
you	1
are	1
anxious	1
that	1
what	1
he	1
directed	1
in	1
his	1
will	1
should	1
be	1
so	1
strictly	1
complied	1
with.”	1
“This	1
is	1
the	1
place,”	1
answered	1
Ambrosia	1
“for	1
in	1
it	1
many	1
a	1
time	1
did	1
my	1
poor	1
friend	1
tell	1
me	1
the	1
story	1
of	1
his	1
hard	1
fortune.	1
Here	1
it	1
was,	1
he	1
told	1
me,	1
that	1
he	1
saw	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
that	1
mortal	1
enemy	1
of	1
the	1
human	1
race,	1
and	1
here,	1
too,	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
he	1
declared	1
to	1
her	1
his	1
passion,	1
as	1
honourable	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
devoted,	1
and	1
here	1
it	1
was	1
that	1
at	1
last	1
Marcela	1
ended	1
by	1
scorning	1
and	1
rejecting	1
him	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
bring	1
the	1
tragedy	1
of	1
his	1
wretched	1
life	1
to	1
a	1
close;	1
here,	1
in	1
memory	1
of	1
misfortunes	1
so	1
great,	1
he	1
desired	1
to	1
be	1
laid	1
in	1
the	1
bowels	1
of	1
eternal	1
oblivion.”	1
Then	1
turning	1
to	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
and	1
the	1
travellers	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
to	1
say,	1
“That	1
body,	1
sirs,	1
on	1
which	1
you	1
are	1
looking	1
with	1
compassionate	1
eyes,	1
was	1
the	1
abode	1
of	1
a	1
soul	1
on	1
which	1
Heaven	1
bestowed	1
a	1
vast	1
share	1
of	1
its	1
riches.	1
That	1
is	1
the	1
body	1
of	1
Chrysostom,	1
who	1
was	1
unrivalled	1
in	1
wit,	1
unequalled	1
in	1
courtesy,	1
unapproached	1
in	1
gentle	1
bearing,	1
a	1
phœnix	1
in	1
friendship,	1
generous	1
without	1
limit,	1
grave	1
without	1
arrogance,	1
gay	1
without	1
vulgarity,	1
and,	1
in	1
short,	1
first	1
in	1
all	1
that	1
constitutes	1
goodness	1
and	1
second	1
to	1
none	1
in	1
all	1
that	1
makes	1
up	1
misfortune.	1
He	1
loved	1
deeply,	1
he	1
was	1
hated;	1
he	1
adored,	1
he	1
was	1
scorned;	1
he	1
wooed	1
a	1
wild	1
beast,	1
he	1
pleaded	1
with	1
marble,	1
he	1
pursued	1
the	1
wind,	1
he	1
cried	1
to	1
the	1
wilderness,	1
he	1
served	1
ingratitude,	1
and	1
for	1
reward	1
was	1
made	1
the	1
prey	1
of	1
death	1
in	1
the	1
mid-course	1
of	1
life,	1
cut	1
short	1
by	1
a	1
shepherdess	1
whom	1
he	1
sought	1
to	1
immortalise	1
in	1
the	1
memory	1
of	1
man,	1
as	1
these	1
papers	1
which	1
you	1
see	1
could	1
fully	1
prove,	1
had	1
he	1
not	1
commanded	1
me	1
to	1
consign	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
fire	1
after	1
having	1
consigned	1
his	1
body	1
to	1
the	1
earth.”	1
“You	1
would	1
deal	1
with	1
them	1
more	1
harshly	1
and	1
cruelly	1
than	1
their	1
owner	1
himself,”	1
said	1
Vivaldo,	1
“for	1
it	1
is	1
neither	1
right	1
nor	1
proper	1
to	1
do	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
one	1
who	1
enjoins	1
what	1
is	1
wholly	1
unreasonable;	1
it	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
been	1
reasonable	1
in	1
Augustus	1
Cæsar	1
had	1
he	1
permitted	1
the	1
directions	1
left	1
by	1
the	1
divine	1
Mantuan	1
in	1
his	1
will	1
to	1
be	1
carried	1
into	1
effect.	1
So	1
that,	1
Señor	1
Ambrosia	1
while	1
you	1
consign	1
your	1
friend’s	1
body	1
to	1
the	1
earth,	1
you	1
should	1
not	1
consign	1
his	1
writings	1
to	1
oblivion,	1
for	1
if	1
he	1
gave	1
the	1
order	1
in	1
bitterness	1
of	1
heart,	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
right	1
that	1
you	1
should	1
irrationally	1
obey	1
it.	1
On	1
the	1
contrary,	1
by	1
granting	1
life	1
to	1
those	1
papers,	1
let	1
the	1
cruelty	1
of	1
Marcela	1
live	1
for	1
ever,	1
to	1
serve	1
as	1
a	1
warning	1
in	1
ages	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
all	1
men	1
to	1
shun	1
and	1
avoid	1
falling	1
into	1
like	1
danger;	1
or	1
I	1
and	1
all	1
of	1
us	1
who	1
have	1
come	1
here	1
know	1
already	1
the	1
story	1
of	1
this	1
your	1
love-stricken	1
and	1
heart-broken	1
friend,	1
and	1
we	1
know,	1
too,	1
your	1
friendship,	1
and	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
his	1
death,	1
and	1
the	1
directions	1
he	1
gave	1
at	1
the	1
close	1
of	1
his	1
life;	1
from	1
which	1
sad	1
story	1
may	1
be	1
gathered	1
how	1
great	1
was	1
the	1
cruelty	1
of	1
Marcela,	1
the	1
love	1
of	1
Chrysostom,	1
and	1
the	1
loyalty	1
of	1
your	1
friendship,	1
together	1
with	1
the	1
end	1
awaiting	1
those	1
who	1
pursue	1
rashly	1
the	1
path	1
that	1
insane	1
passion	1
opens	1
to	1
their	1
eyes.	1
Last	1
night	1
we	1
learned	1
the	1
death	1
of	1
Chrysostom	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
buried	1
here,	1
and	1
out	1
of	1
curiosity	1
and	1
pity	1
we	1
left	1
our	1
direct	1
road	1
and	1
resolved	1
to	1
come	1
and	1
see	1
with	1
our	1
eyes	1
that	1
which	1
when	1
heard	1
of	1
had	1
so	1
moved	1
our	1
compassion,	1
and	1
in	1
consideration	1
of	1
that	1
compassion	1
and	1
our	1
desire	1
to	1
prove	1
it	1
if	1
we	1
might	1
by	1
condolence,	1
we	1
beg	1
of	1
you,	1
excellent	1
Ambrosia,	1
or	1
at	1
least	1
I	1
on	1
my	1
own	1
account	1
entreat	1
you,	1
that	1
instead	1
of	1
burning	1
those	1
papers	1
you	1
allow	1
me	1
to	1
carry	1
away	1
some	1
of	1
them.”	1
And	1
without	1
waiting	1
for	1
the	1
shepherd’s	1
answer,	1
he	1
stretched	1
out	1
his	1
hand	1
and	1
took	1
up	1
some	1
of	1
those	1
that	1
were	1
nearest	1
to	1
him;	1
seeing	1
which	1
Ambrosio	1
said,	1
“Out	1
of	1
courtesy,	1
señor,	1
I	1
will	1
grant	1
your	1
request	1
as	1
to	1
those	1
you	1
have	1
taken,	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
idle	1
to	1
expect	1
me	1
to	1
abstain	1
from	1
burning	1
the	1
remainder.”	1
Vivaldo,	1
who	1
was	1
eager	1
to	1
see	1
what	1
the	1
papers	1
contained,	1
opened	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
at	1
once,	1
and	1
saw	1
that	1
its	1
title	1
was	1
“Lay	1
of	1
Despair.”	1
Ambrosio	1
hearing	1
it	1
said,	1
“That	1
is	1
the	1
last	1
paper	1
the	1
unhappy	1
man	1
wrote;	1
and	1
that	1
you	1
may	1
see,	1
señor,	1
to	1
what	1
an	1
end	1
his	1
misfortunes	1
brought	1
him,	1
read	1
it	1
so	1
that	1
you	1
may	1
be	1
heard,	1
for	1
you	1
will	1
have	1
time	1
enough	1
for	1
that	1
while	1
we	1
are	1
waiting	1
for	1
the	1
grave	1
to	1
be	1
dug.”	1
“I	1
will	1
do	1
so	1
very	1
willingly,”	1
said	1
Vivaldo;	1
and	1
as	1
all	1
the	1
bystanders	1
were	1
equally	1
eager	1
they	1
gathered	1
round	1
him,	1
and	1
he,	1
reading	1
in	1
a	1
loud	1
voice,	1
found	1
that	1
it	1
ran	1
as	1
follows.	1

THE	1
LAY	1
OF	1
CHRYSOSTOM	1
Since	1
thou	1
dost	1
in	1
thy	1
cruelty	1
desire	1
The	1
ruthless	1
rigour	1
of	1
thy	1
tyranny	1
From	1
tongue	1
to	1
tongue,	1
from	1
land	1
to	1
land	1
proclaimed,	1
The	1
very	1
Hell	1
will	1
I	1
constrain	1
to	1
lend	1
This	1
stricken	1
breast	1
of	1
mine	1
deep	1
notes	1
of	1
woe	1
To	1
serve	1
my	1
need	1
of	1
fitting	1
utterance.	1
And	1
as	1
I	1
strive	1
to	1
body	1
forth	1
the	1
tale	1
Of	1
all	1
I	1
suffer,	1
all	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
done,	1
Forth	1
shall	1
the	1
dread	1
voice	1
roll,	1
and	1
bear	1
along	1
Shreds	1
from	1
my	1
vitals	1
torn	1
for	1
greater	1
pain.	1
Then	1
listen,	1
not	1
to	1
dulcet	1
harmony,	1
But	1
to	1
a	1
discord	1
wrung	1
by	1
mad	1
despair	1
Out	1
of	1
this	1
bosom’s	1
depths	1
of	1
bitterness,	1
To	1
ease	1
my	1
heart	1
and	1
plant	1
a	1
sting	1
in	1
thine.	1
The	1
lion’s	1
roar,	1
the	1
fierce	1
wolf’s	1
savage	1
howl,	1
The	1
horrid	1
hissing	1
of	1
the	1
scaly	1
snake,	1
The	1
awesome	1
cries	1
of	1
monsters	1
yet	1
unnamed,	1
The	1
crow’s	1
ill-boding	1
croak,	1
the	1
hollow	1
moan	1
Of	1
wild	1
winds	1
wrestling	1
with	1
the	1
restless	1
sea,	1
The	1
wrathful	1
bellow	1
of	1
the	1
vanquished	1
bull,	1
The	1
plaintive	1
sobbing	1
of	1
the	1
widowed	1
dove,	1
The	1
envied	1
owl’s	1
sad	1
note,	1
the	1
wail	1
of	1
woe	1
That	1
rises	1
from	1
the	1
dreary	1
choir	1
of	1
Hell,	1
Commingled	1
in	1
one	1
sound,	1
confusing	1
sense,	1
Let	1
all	1
these	1
come	1
to	1
aid	1
my	1
soul’s	1
complaint,	1
For	1
pain	1
like	1
mine	1
demands	1
new	1
modes	1
of	1
song.	1
No	1
echoes	1
of	1
that	1
discord	1
shall	1
be	1
heard	1
Where	1
Father	1
Tagus	1
rolls,	1
or	1
on	1
the	1
banks	1
Of	1
olive-bordered	1
Betis;	1
to	1
the	1
rocks	1
Or	1
in	1
deep	1
caverns	1
shall	1
my	1
plaint	1
be	1
told,	1
And	1
by	1
a	1
lifeless	1
tongue	1
in	1
living	1
words;	1
Or	1
in	1
dark	1
valleys	1
or	1
on	1
lonely	1
shores,	1
Where	1
neither	1
foot	1
of	1
man	1
nor	1
sunbeam	1
falls;	1
Or	1
in	1
among	1
the	1
poison-breathing	1
swarms	1
Of	1
monsters	1
nourished	1
by	1
the	1
sluggish	1
Nile.	1
For,	1
though	1
it	1
be	1
to	1
solitudes	1
remote	1
The	1
hoarse	1
vague	1
echoes	1
of	1
my	1
sorrows	1
sound	1
Thy	1
matchless	1
cruelty,	1
my	1
dismal	1
fate	1
Shall	1
carry	1
them	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
spacious	1
world.	1
Disdain	1
hath	1
power	1
to	1
kill,	1
and	1
patience	1
dies	1
Slain	1
by	1
suspicion,	1
be	1
it	1
false	1
or	1
true;	1
And	1
deadly	1
is	1
the	1
force	1
of	1
jealousy;	1
Long	1
absence	1
makes	1
of	1
life	1
a	1
dreary	1
void;	1
No	1
hope	1
of	1
happiness	1
can	1
give	1
repose	1
To	1
him	1
that	1
ever	1
fears	1
to	1
be	1
forgot;	1
And	1
death,	1
inevitable,	1
waits	1
in	1
hall.	1
But	1
I,	1
by	1
some	1
strange	1
miracle,	1
live	1
on	1
A	1
prey	1
to	1
absence,	1
jealousy,	1
disdain;	1
Racked	1
by	1
suspicion	1
as	1
by	1
certainty;	1
Forgotten,	1
left	1
to	1
feed	1
my	1
flame	1
alone.	1
And	1
while	1
I	1
suffer	1
thus,	1
there	1
comes	1
no	1
ray	1
Of	1
hope	1
to	1
gladden	1
me	1
athwart	1
the	1
gloom;	1
Nor	1
do	1
I	1
look	1
for	1
it	1
in	1
my	1
despair;	1
But	1
rather	1
clinging	1
to	1
a	1
cureless	1
woe,	1
All	1
hope	1
do	1
I	1
abjure	1
for	1
evermore.	1
Can	1
there	1
be	1
hope	1
where	1
fear	1
is?	1
Were	1
it	1
well,	1
When	1
far	1
more	1
certain	1
are	1
the	1
grounds	1
of	1
fear?	1
Ought	1
I	1
to	1
shut	1
mine	1
eyes	1
to	1
jealousy,	1
If	1
through	1
a	1
thousand	1
heart-wounds	1
it	1
appears?	1
Who	1
would	1
not	1
give	1
free	1
access	1
to	1
distrust,	1
Seeing	1
disdain	1
unveiled,	1
and—bitter	1
change!—	1
All	1
his	1
suspicions	1
turned	1
to	1
certainties,	1
And	1
the	1
fair	1
truth	1
transformed	1
into	1
a	1
lie?	1
Oh,	1
thou	1
fierce	1
tyrant	1
of	1
the	1
realms	1
of	1
love,	1
Oh,	1
Jealousy!	1
put	1
chains	1
upon	1
these	1
hands,	1
And	1
bind	1
me	1
with	1
thy	1
strongest	1
cord,	1
Disdain.	1
But,	1
woe	1
is	1
me!	1
triumphant	1
over	1
all,	1
My	1
sufferings	1
drown	1
the	1
memory	1
of	1
you.	1
And	1
now	1
I	1
die,	1
and	1
since	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
hope	1
Of	1
happiness	1
for	1
me	1
in	1
life	1
or	1
death,	1
Still	1
to	1
my	1
fantasy	1
I’ll	1
fondly	1
cling.	1
I’ll	1
say	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
wise	1
who	1
loveth	1
well,	1
And	1
that	1
the	1
soul	1
most	1
free	1
is	1
that	1
most	1
bound	1
In	1
thraldom	1
to	1
the	1
ancient	1
tyrant	1
Love.	1
I’ll	1
say	1
that	1
she	1
who	1
is	1
mine	1
enemy	1
In	1
that	1
fair	1
body	1
hath	1
as	1
fair	1
a	1
mind,	1
And	1
that	1
her	1
coldness	1
is	1
but	1
my	1
desert,	1
And	1
that	1
by	1
virtue	1
of	1
the	1
pain	1
he	1
sends	1
Love	1
rules	1
his	1
kingdom	1
with	1
a	1
gentle	1
sway.	1
Thus,	1
self-deluding,	1
and	1
in	1
bondage	1
sore,	1
And	1
wearing	1
out	1
the	1
wretched	1
shred	1
of	1
life	1
To	1
which	1
I	1
am	1
reduced	1
by	1
her	1
disdain,	1
I’ll	1
give	1
this	1
soul	1
and	1
body	1
to	1
the	1
winds,	1
All	1
hopeless	1
of	1
a	1
crown	1
of	1
bliss	1
in	1
store.	1
Thou	1
whose	1
injustice	1
hath	1
supplied	1
the	1
cause	1
That	1
makes	1
me	1
quit	1
the	1
weary	1
life	1
I	1
loathe,	1
As	1
by	1
this	1
wounded	1
bosom	1
thou	1
canst	1
see	1
How	1
willingly	1
thy	1
victim	1
I	1
become,	1
Let	1
not	1
my	1
death,	1
if	1
haply	1
worth	1
a	1
tear,	1
Cloud	1
the	1
clear	1
heaven	1
that	1
dwells	1
in	1
thy	1
bright	1
eyes;	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
thee	1
expiate	1
in	1
aught	1
The	1
crime	1
of	1
having	1
made	1
my	1
heart	1
thy	1
prey;	1
But	1
rather	1
let	1
thy	1
laughter	1
gaily	1
ring	1
And	1
prove	1
my	1
death	1
to	1
be	1
thy	1
festival.	1
Fool	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
to	1
bid	1
thee!	1
well	1
I	1
know	1
Thy	1
glory	1
gains	1
by	1
my	1
untimely	1
end.	1
And	1
now	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
time;	1
from	1
Hell’s	1
abyss	1
Come	1
thirsting	1
Tantalus,	1
come	1
Sisyphus	1
Heaving	1
the	1
cruel	1
stone,	1
come	1
Tityus	1
With	1
vulture,	1
and	1
with	1
wheel	1
Ixion	1
come,	1
And	1
come	1
the	1
sisters	1
of	1
the	1
ceaseless	1
toil;	1
And	1
all	1
into	1
this	1
breast	1
transfer	1
their	1
pains,	1
And	1
(if	1
such	1
tribute	1
to	1
despair	1
be	1
due)	1
Chant	1
in	1
their	1
deepest	1
tones	1
a	1
doleful	1
dirge	1
Over	1
a	1
corse	1
unworthy	1
of	1
a	1
shroud.	1
Let	1
the	1
three-headed	1
guardian	1
of	1
the	1
gate,	1
And	1
all	1
the	1
monstrous	1
progeny	1
of	1
hell,	1
The	1
doleful	1
concert	1
join:	1
a	1
lover	1
dead	1
Methinks	1
can	1
have	1
no	1
fitter	1
obsequies.	1
Lay	1
of	1
despair,	1
grieve	1
not	1
when	1
thou	1
art	1
gone	1
Forth	1
from	1
this	1
sorrowing	1
heart:	1
my	1
misery	1
Brings	1
fortune	1
to	1
the	1
cause	1
that	1
gave	1
thee	1
birth;	1
Then	1
banish	1
sadness	1
even	1
in	1
the	1
tomb.	1
The	1
“Lay	1
of	1
Chrysostom”	1
met	1
with	1
the	1
approbation	1
of	1
the	1
listeners,	1
though	1
the	1
reader	1
said	1
it	1
did	1
not	1
seem	1
to	1
him	1
to	1
agree	1
with	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
heard	1
of	1
Marcela’s	1
reserve	1
and	1
propriety,	1
for	1
Chrysostom	1
complained	1
in	1
it	1
of	1
jealousy,	1
suspicion,	1
and	1
absence,	1
all	1
to	1
the	1
prejudice	1
of	1
the	1
good	1
name	1
and	1
fame	1
of	1
Marcela;	1
to	1
which	1
Ambrosio	1
replied	1
as	1
one	1
who	1
knew	1
well	1
his	1
friend’s	1
most	1
secret	1
thoughts,	1
“Señor,	1
to	1
remove	1
that	1
doubt	1
I	1
should	1
tell	1
you	1
that	1
when	1
the	1
unhappy	1
man	1
wrote	1
this	1
lay	1
he	1
was	1
away	1
from	1
Marcela,	1
from	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
voluntarily	1
separated	1
himself,	1
to	1
try	1
if	1
absence	1
would	1
act	1
with	1
him	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
wont;	1
and	1
as	1
everything	1
distresses	1
and	1
every	1
fear	1
haunts	1
the	1
banished	1
lover,	1
so	1
imaginary	1
jealousies	1
and	1
suspicions,	1
dreaded	1
as	1
if	1
they	1
were	1
true,	1
tormented	1
Chrysostom;	1
and	1
thus	1
the	1
truth	1
of	1
what	1
report	1
declares	1
of	1
the	1
virtue	1
of	1
Marcela	1
remains	1
unshaken,	1
and	1
with	1
her	1
envy	1
itself	1
should	1
not	1
and	1
cannot	1
find	1
any	1
fault	1
save	1
that	1
of	1
being	1
cruel,	1
somewhat	1
haughty,	1
and	1
very	1
scornful.”	1
“That	1
is	1
true,”	1
said	1
Vivaldo;	1
and	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
read	1
another	1
paper	1
of	1
those	1
he	1
had	1
preserved	1
from	1
the	1
fire,	1
he	1
was	1
stopped	1
by	1
a	1
marvellous	1
vision	1
(for	1
such	1
it	1
seemed)	1
that	1
unexpectedly	1
presented	1
itself	1
to	1
their	1
eyes;	1
for	1
on	1
the	1
summit	1
of	1
the	1
rock	1
where	1
they	1
were	1
digging	1
the	1
grave	1
there	1
appeared	1
the	1
shepherdess	1
Marcela,	1
so	1
beautiful	1
that	1
her	1
beauty	1
exceeded	1
its	1
reputation.	1
Those	1
who	1
had	1
never	1
till	1
then	1
beheld	1
her	1
gazed	1
upon	1
her	1
in	1
wonder	1
and	1
silence,	1
and	1
those	1
who	1
were	1
accustomed	1
to	1
see	1
her	1
were	1
not	1
less	1
amazed	1
than	1
those	1
who	1
had	1
never	1
seen	1
her	1
before.	1
But	1
the	1
instant	1
Ambrosio	1
saw	1
her	1
he	1
addressed	1
her,	1
with	1
manifest	1
indignation:	1
“Art	1
thou	1
come,	1
by	1
chance,	1
cruel	1
basilisk	1
of	1
these	1
mountains,	1
to	1
see	1
if	1
in	1
thy	1
presence	1
blood	1
will	1
flow	1
from	1
the	1
wounds	1
of	1
this	1
wretched	1
being	1
thy	1
cruelty	1
has	1
robbed	1
of	1
life;	1
or	1
is	1
it	1
to	1
exult	1
over	1
the	1
cruel	1
work	1
of	1
thy	1
humours	1
that	1
thou	1
art	1
come;	1
or	1
like	1
another	1
pitiless	1
Nero	1
to	1
look	1
down	1
from	1
that	1
height	1
upon	1
the	1
ruin	1
of	1
his	1
Rome	1
in	1
embers;	1
or	1
in	1
thy	1
arrogance	1
to	1
trample	1
on	1
this	1
ill-fated	1
corpse,	1
as	1
the	1
ungrateful	1
daughter	1
trampled	1
on	1
her	1
father	1
Tarquin’s?	1
Tell	1
us	1
quickly	1
for	1
what	1
thou	1
art	1
come,	1
or	1
what	1
it	1
is	1
thou	1
wouldst	1
have,	1
for,	1
as	1
I	1
know	1
the	1
thoughts	1
of	1
Chrysostom	1
never	1
failed	1
to	1
obey	1
thee	1
in	1
life,	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
all	1
these	1
who	1
call	1
themselves	1
his	1
friends	1
obey	1
thee,	1
though	1
he	1
be	1
dead.”	1
“I	1
come	1
not,	1
Ambrosia	1
for	1
any	1
of	1
the	1
purposes	1
thou	1
hast	1
named,”	1
replied	1
Marcela,	1
“but	1
to	1
defend	1
myself	1
and	1
to	1
prove	1
how	1
unreasonable	1
are	1
all	1
those	1
who	1
blame	1
me	1
for	1
their	1
sorrow	1
and	1
for	1
Chrysostom’s	1
death;	1
and	1
therefore	1
I	1
ask	1
all	1
of	1
you	1
that	1
are	1
here	1
to	1
give	1
me	1
your	1
attention,	1
for	1
it	1
will	1
not	1
take	1
much	1
time	1
or	1
many	1
words	1
to	1
bring	1
the	1
truth	1
home	1
to	1
persons	1
of	1
sense.	1
Heaven	1
has	1
made	1
me,	1
so	1
you	1
say,	1
beautiful,	1
and	1
so	1
much	1
so	1
that	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
yourselves	1
my	1
beauty	1
leads	1
you	1
to	1
love	1
me;	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
love	1
you	1
show	1
me	1
you	1
say,	1
and	1
even	1
urge,	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
bound	1
to	1
love	1
you.	1
By	1
that	1
natural	1
understanding	1
which	1
God	1
has	1
given	1
me	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
everything	1
beautiful	1
attracts	1
love,	1
but	1
I	1
cannot	1
see	1
how,	1
by	1
reason	1
of	1
being	1
loved,	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
loved	1
for	1
its	1
beauty	1
is	1
bound	1
to	1
love	1
that	1
which	1
loves	1
it;	1
besides,	1
it	1
may	1
happen	1
that	1
the	1
lover	1
of	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
beautiful	1
may	1
be	1
ugly,	1
and	1
ugliness	1
being	1
detestable,	1
it	1
is	1
very	1
absurd	1
to	1
say,	1
“I	1
love	1
thee	1
because	1
thou	1
art	1
beautiful,	1
thou	1
must	1
love	1
me	1
though	1
I	1
be	1
ugly.”	1
But	1
supposing	1
the	1
beauty	1
equal	1
on	1
both	1
sides,	1
it	1
does	1
not	1
follow	1
that	1
the	1
inclinations	1
must	1
be	1
therefore	1
alike,	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
every	1
beauty	1
that	1
excites	1
love,	1
some	1
but	1
pleasing	1
the	1
eye	1
without	1
winning	1
the	1
affection;	1
and	1
if	1
every	1
sort	1
of	1
beauty	1
excited	1
love	1
and	1
won	1
the	1
heart,	1
the	1
will	1
would	1
wander	1
vaguely	1
to	1
and	1
fro	1
unable	1
to	1
make	1
choice	1
of	1
any;	1
for	1
as	1
there	1
is	1
an	1
infinity	1
of	1
beautiful	1
objects	1
there	1
must	1
be	1
an	1
infinity	1
of	1
inclinations,	1
and	1
true	1
love,	1
I	1
have	1
heard	1
it	1
said,	1
is	1
indivisible,	1
and	1
must	1
be	1
voluntary	1
and	1
not	1
compelled.	1
If	1
this	1
be	1
so,	1
as	1
I	1
believe	1
it	1
to	1
be,	1
why	1
do	1
you	1
desire	1
me	1
to	1
bend	1
my	1
will	1
by	1
force,	1
for	1
no	1
other	1
reason	1
but	1
that	1
you	1
say	1
you	1
love	1
me?	1
Nay—tell	1
me—had	1
Heaven	1
made	1
me	1
ugly,	1
as	1
it	1
has	1
made	1
me	1
beautiful,	1
could	1
I	1
with	1
justice	1
complain	1
of	1
you	1
for	1
not	1
loving	1
me?	1
Moreover,	1
you	1
must	1
remember	1
that	1
the	1
beauty	1
I	1
possess	1
was	1
no	1
choice	1
of	1
mine,	1
for,	1
be	1
it	1
what	1
it	1
may,	1
Heaven	1
of	1
its	1
bounty	1
gave	1
it	1
me	1
without	1
my	1
asking	1
or	1
choosing	1
it;	1
and	1
as	1
the	1
viper,	1
though	1
it	1
kills	1
with	1
it,	1
does	1
not	1
deserve	1
to	1
be	1
blamed	1
for	1
the	1
poison	1
it	1
carries,	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
gift	1
of	1
nature,	1
neither	1
do	1
I	1
deserve	1
reproach	1
for	1
being	1
beautiful;	1
for	1
beauty	1
in	1
a	1
modest	1
woman	1
is	1
like	1
fire	1
at	1
a	1
distance	1
or	1
a	1
sharp	1
sword;	1
the	1
one	1
does	1
not	1
burn,	1
the	1
other	1
does	1
not	1
cut,	1
those	1
who	1
do	1
not	1
come	1
too	1
near.	1
Honour	1
and	1
virtue	1
are	1
the	1
ornaments	1
of	1
the	1
mind,	1
without	1
which	1
the	1
body,	1
though	1
it	1
be	1
so,	1
has	1
no	1
right	1
to	1
pass	1
for	1
beautiful;	1
but	1
if	1
modesty	1
is	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
virtues	1
that	1
specially	1
lend	1
a	1
grace	1
and	1
charm	1
to	1
mind	1
and	1
body,	1
why	1
should	1
she	1
who	1
is	1
loved	1
for	1
her	1
beauty	1
part	1
with	1
it	1
to	1
gratify	1
one	1
who	1
for	1
his	1
pleasure	1
alone	1
strives	1
with	1
all	1
his	1
might	1
and	1
energy	1
to	1
rob	1
her	1
of	1
it?	1
I	1
was	1
born	1
free,	1
and	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
live	1
in	1
freedom	1
I	1
chose	1
the	1
solitude	1
of	1
the	1
fields;	1
in	1
the	1
trees	1
of	1
the	1
mountains	1
I	1
find	1
society,	1
the	1
clear	1
waters	1
of	1
the	1
brooks	1
are	1
my	1
mirrors,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
trees	1
and	1
waters	1
I	1
make	1
known	1
my	1
thoughts	1
and	1
charms.	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
fire	1
afar	1
off,	1
a	1
sword	1
laid	1
aside.	1
Those	1
whom	1
I	1
have	1
inspired	1
with	1
love	1
by	1
letting	1
them	1
see	1
me,	1
I	1
have	1
by	1
words	1
undeceived,	1
and	1
if	1
their	1
longings	1
live	1
on	1
hope—and	1
I	1
have	1
given	1
none	1
to	1
Chrysostom	1
or	1
to	1
any	1
other—it	1
cannot	1
justly	1
be	1
said	1
that	1
the	1
death	1
of	1
any	1
is	1
my	1
doing,	1
for	1
it	1
was	1
rather	1
his	1
own	1
obstinacy	1
than	1
my	1
cruelty	1
that	1
killed	1
him;	1
and	1
if	1
it	1
be	1
made	1
a	1
charge	1
against	1
me	1
that	1
his	1
wishes	1
were	1
honourable,	1
and	1
that	1
therefore	1
I	1
was	1
bound	1
to	1
yield	1
to	1
them,	1
I	1
answer	1
that	1
when	1
on	1
this	1
very	1
spot	1
where	1
now	1
his	1
grave	1
is	1
made	1
he	1
declared	1
to	1
me	1
his	1
purity	1
of	1
purpose,	1
I	1
told	1
him	1
that	1
mine	1
was	1
to	1
live	1
in	1
perpetual	1
solitude,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
earth	1
alone	1
should	1
enjoy	1
the	1
fruits	1
of	1
my	1
retirement	1
and	1
the	1
spoils	1
of	1
my	1
beauty;	1
and	1
if,	1
after	1
this	1
open	1
avowal,	1
he	1
chose	1
to	1
persist	1
against	1
hope	1
and	1
steer	1
against	1
the	1
wind,	1
what	1
wonder	1
is	1
it	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
sink	1
in	1
the	1
depths	1
of	1
his	1
infatuation?	1
If	1
I	1
had	1
encouraged	1
him,	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
false;	1
if	1
I	1
had	1
gratified	1
him,	1
I	1
should	1
have	1
acted	1
against	1
my	1
own	1
better	1
resolution	1
and	1
purpose.	1
He	1
was	1
persistent	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
warning,	1
he	1
despaired	1
without	1
being	1
hated.	1
Bethink	1
you	1
now	1
if	1
it	1
be	1
reasonable	1
that	1
his	1
suffering	1
should	1
be	1
laid	1
to	1
my	1
charge.	1
Let	1
him	1
who	1
has	1
been	1
deceived	1
complain,	1
let	1
him	1
give	1
way	1
to	1
despair	1
whose	1
encouraged	1
hopes	1
have	1
proved	1
vain,	1
let	1
him	1
flatter	1
himself	1
whom	1
I	1
shall	1
entice,	1
let	1
him	1
boast	1
whom	1
I	1
shall	1
receive;	1
but	1
let	1
not	1
him	1
call	1
me	1
cruel	1
or	1
homicide	1
to	1
whom	1
I	1
make	1
no	1
promise,	1
upon	1
whom	1
I	1
practise	1
no	1
deception,	1
whom	1
I	1
neither	1
entice	1
nor	1
receive.	1
It	1
has	1
not	1
been	1
so	1
far	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
Heaven	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
love	1
by	1
fate,	1
and	1
to	1
expect	1
me	1
to	1
love	1
by	1
choice	1
is	1
idle.	1
Let	1
this	1
general	1
declaration	1
serve	1
for	1
each	1
of	1
my	1
suitors	1
on	1
his	1
own	1
account,	1
and	1
let	1
it	1
be	1
understood	1
from	1
this	1
time	1
forth	1
that	1
if	1
anyone	1
dies	1
for	1
me	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
of	1
jealousy	1
or	1
misery	1
he	1
dies,	1
for	1
she	1
who	1
loves	1
no	1
one	1
can	1
give	1
no	1
cause	1
for	1
jealousy	1
to	1
any,	1
and	1
candour	1
is	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
confounded	1
with	1
scorn.	1
Let	1
him	1
who	1
calls	1
me	1
wild	1
beast	1
and	1
basilisk,	1
leave	1
me	1
alone	1
as	1
something	1
noxious	1
and	1
evil;	1
let	1
him	1
who	1
calls	1
me	1
ungrateful,	1
withhold	1
his	1
service;	1
who	1
calls	1
me	1
wayward,	1
seek	1
not	1
my	1
acquaintance;	1
who	1
calls	1
me	1
cruel,	1
pursue	1
me	1
not;	1
for	1
this	1
wild	1
beast,	1
this	1
basilisk,	1
this	1
ungrateful,	1
cruel,	1
wayward	1
being	1
has	1
no	1
kind	1
of	1
desire	1
to	1
seek,	1
serve,	1
know,	1
or	1
follow	1
them.	1
If	1
Chrysostom’s	1
impatience	1
and	1
violent	1
passion	1
killed	1
him,	1
why	1
should	1
my	1
modest	1
behaviour	1
and	1
circumspection	1
be	1
blamed?	1
If	1
I	1
preserve	1
my	1
purity	1
in	1
the	1
society	1
of	1
the	1
trees,	1
why	1
should	1
he	1
who	1
would	1
have	1
me	1
preserve	1
it	1
among	1
men,	1
seek	1
to	1
rob	1
me	1
of	1
it?	1
I	1
have,	1
as	1
you	1
know,	1
wealth	1
of	1
my	1
own,	1
and	1
I	1
covet	1
not	1
that	1
of	1
others;	1
my	1
taste	1
is	1
for	1
freedom,	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
relish	1
for	1
constraint;	1
I	1
neither	1
love	1
nor	1
hate	1
anyone;	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
deceive	1
this	1
one	1
or	1
court	1
that,	1
or	1
trifle	1
with	1
one	1
or	1
play	1
with	1
another.	1
The	1
modest	1
converse	1
of	1
the	1
shepherd	1
girls	1
of	1
these	1
hamlets	1
and	1
the	1
care	1
of	1
my	1
goats	1
are	1
my	1
recreations;	1
my	1
desires	1
are	1
bounded	1
by	1
these	1
mountains,	1
and	1
if	1
they	1
ever	1
wander	1
hence	1
it	1
is	1
to	1
contemplate	1
the	1
beauty	1
of	1
the	1
heavens,	1
steps	1
by	1
which	1
the	1
soul	1
travels	1
to	1
its	1
primeval	1
abode.”	1
With	1
these	1
words,	1
and	1
not	1
waiting	1
to	1
hear	1
a	1
reply,	1
she	1
turned	1
and	1
passed	1
into	1
the	1
thickest	1
part	1
of	1
a	1
wood	1
that	1
was	1
hard	1
by,	1
leaving	1
all	1
who	1
were	1
there	1
lost	1
in	1
admiration	1
as	1
much	1
of	1
her	1
good	1
sense	1
as	1
of	1
her	1
beauty.	1
Some—those	1
wounded	1
by	1
the	1
irresistible	1
shafts	1
launched	1
by	1
her	1
bright	1
eyes—made	1
as	1
though	1
they	1
would	1
follow	1
her,	1
heedless	1
of	1
the	1
frank	1
declaration	1
they	1
had	1
heard;	1
seeing	1
which,	1
and	1
deeming	1
this	1
a	1
fitting	1
occasion	1
for	1
the	1
exercise	1
of	1
his	1
chivalry	1
in	1
aid	1
of	1
distressed	1
damsels,	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
laying	1
his	1
hand	1
on	1
the	1
hilt	1
of	1
his	1
sword,	1
exclaimed	1
in	1
a	1
loud	1
and	1
distinct	1
voice:	1
“Let	1
no	1
one,	1
whatever	1
his	1
rank	1
or	1
condition,	1
dare	1
to	1
follow	1
the	1
beautiful	1
Marcela,	1
under	1
pain	1
of	1
incurring	1
my	1
fierce	1
indignation.	1
She	1
has	1
shown	1
by	1
clear	1
and	1
satisfactory	1
arguments	1
that	1
little	1
or	1
no	1
fault	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
found	1
with	1
her	1
for	1
the	1
death	1
of	1
Chrysostom,	1
and	1
also	1
how	1
far	1
she	1
is	1
from	1
yielding	1
to	1
the	1
wishes	1
of	1
any	1
of	1
her	1
lovers,	1
for	1
which	1
reason,	1
instead	1
of	1
being	1
followed	1
and	1
persecuted,	1
she	1
should	1
in	1
justice	1
be	1
honoured	1
and	1
esteemed	1
by	1
all	1
the	1
good	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
world,	1
for	1
she	1
shows	1
that	1
she	1
is	1
the	1
only	1
woman	1
in	1
it	1
that	1
holds	1
to	1
such	1
a	1
virtuous	1
resolution.”	1
Whether	1
it	1
was	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
threats	1
of	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
or	1
because	1
Ambrosio	1
told	1
them	1
to	1
fulfil	1
their	1
duty	1
to	1
their	1
good	1
friend,	1
none	1
of	1
the	1
shepherds	1
moved	1
or	1
stirred	1
from	1
the	1
spot	1
until,	1
having	1
finished	1
the	1
grave	1
and	1
burned	1
Chrysostom’s	1
papers,	1
they	1
laid	1
his	1
body	1
in	1
it,	1
not	1
without	1
many	1
tears	1
from	1
those	1
who	1
stood	1
by.	1
They	1
closed	1
the	1
grave	1
with	1
a	1
heavy	1
stone	1
until	1
a	1
slab	1
was	1
ready	1
which	1
Ambrosio	1
said	1
he	1
meant	1
to	1
have	1
prepared,	1
with	1
an	1
epitaph	1
which	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
to	1
this	1
effect:	1
Beneath	1
the	1
stone	1
before	1
your	1
eyes	1
The	1
body	1
of	1
a	1
lover	1
lies;	1
In	1
life	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
shepherd	1
swain,	1
In	1
death	1
a	1
victim	1
to	1
disdain.	1
Ungrateful,	1
cruel,	1
coy,	1
and	1
fair,	1
Was	1
she	1

drove	1
him	1
to	1
despair,	1
And	1
Love	1
hath	1
made	1
her	1
his	1
ally	1
For	1
spreading	1
wide	1
his	1
tyranny.	1
They	1
then	1
strewed	1
upon	1
the	1
grave	1
a	1
profusion	1
of	1
flowers	1
and	1
branches,	1
and	1
all	1
expressing	1
their	1
condolence	1
with	1
his	1
friend	1
Ambrosio,	1
took	1
their	1
leave.	1
Vivaldo	1
and	1
his	1
companion	1
did	1
the	1
same;	1
and	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
bade	1
farewell	1
to	1
his	1
hosts	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
travellers,	1
who	1
pressed	1
him	1
to	1
come	1
with	1
them	1
to	1
Seville,	1
as	1
being	1
such	1
a	1
convenient	1
place	1
for	1
finding	1
adventures,	1
for	1
they	1
presented	1
themselves	1
in	1
every	1
street	1
and	1
round	1
every	1
corner	1
oftener	1
than	1
anywhere	1
else.	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
thanked	1
them	1
for	1
their	1
advice	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
disposition	1
they	1
showed	1
to	1
do	1
him	1
a	1
favour,	1
and	1
said	1
that	1
for	1
the	1
present	1
he	1
would	1
not,	1
and	1
must	1
not	1
go	1
to	1
Seville	1
until	1
he	1
had	1
cleared	1
all	1
these	1
mountains	1
of	1
highwaymen	1
and	1
robbers,	1
of	1
whom	1
report	1
said	1
they	1
were	1
full.	1
Seeing	1
his	1
good	1
intention,	1
the	1
travellers	1
were	1
unwilling	1
to	1
press	1
him	1
further,	1
and	1
once	1
more	1
bidding	1
him	1
farewell,	1
they	1
left	1
him	1
and	1
pursued	1
their	1
journey,	1
in	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
which	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
fail	1
to	1
discuss	1
the	1
story	1
of	1
Marcela	1
and	1
Chrysostom	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
the	1
madness	1
of	1
Don	1
Quixote.	1
He,	1
on	1
his	1
part,	1
resolved	1
to	1
go	1
in	1
quest	1
of	1
the	1
shepherdess	1
Marcela,	1
and	1
make	1
offer	1
to	1
her	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
service	1
he	1
could	1
render	1
her;	1
but	1
things	1
did	1
not	1
fall	1
out	1
with	1
him	1
as	1
he	1
expected,	1
according	1
to	1
what	1
is	1
related	1
in	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
this	1
veracious	1
history,	1

that	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
took	1

of	1
his	1

and	1
all	1
who	1
had	1

two	1

in	1
all	1
directions	1
in	1
search	1
of	1
her	1
without	1

her,	1
they	1
came	1
to	1
a	1
halt	1
in	1
a	1
glade	1
covered	1
with	1
tender	1
grass,	1
beside	1
which	1
ran	1
a	1
pleasant	1

by	1

without	1

master	1

Sancho	1
had	1
not	1
thought	1
it	1
worth	1
while	1
to	1
hobble	1
Rocinante,	1
feeling	1
sure,	1
from	1
what	1
he	1
knew	1
of	1
his	1
staidness	1
and	1
freedom	1
from	1
incontinence,	1
that	1
all	1
the	1
mares	1
in	1
the	1
Cordova	1
pastures	1
would	1
not	1
lead	1
him	1
into	1
an	1
impropriety.	1
Chance,	1
however,	1
and	1
the	1
devil,	1
who	1
is	1
not	1
always	1
asleep,	1
so	1
ordained	1
it	1
that	1
feeding	1
in	1
this	1
valley	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
drove	1
of	1
Galician	1
ponies	1
belonging	1
to	1
certain	1
Yanguesan	1
carriers,	1
whose	1
way	1
it	1
is	1
to	1
take	1
their	1
midday	1
rest	1
with	1
their	1
teams	1
in	1
places	1
and	1
spots	1
where	1
grass	1
and	1
water	1
abound;	1
and	1
that	1
where	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
chanced	1
to	1
be	1
suited	1
the	1
Yanguesans’	1
purpose	1
very	1
well.	1
It	1
so	1
happened,	1
then,	1
that	1
Rocinante	1
took	1
a	1
fancy	1
to	1
disport	1
himself	1
with	1
their	1
ladyships	1
the	1
ponies,	1
and	1
abandoning	1
his	1
usual	1
gait	1
and	1
demeanour	1
as	1
he	1
scented	1
them,	1
he,	1
without	1
asking	1
leave	1
of	1
his	1
master,	1
got	1
up	1
a	1
briskish	1
little	1
trot	1
and	1
hastened	1
to	1
make	1
known	1
his	1
wishes	1
to	1
them;	1
they,	1
however,	1
it	1
seemed,	1
preferred	1
their	1
pasture	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
received	1
him	1
with	1
their	1
heels	1
and	1
teeth	1
to	1
such	1
effect	1
that	1
they	1
soon	1
broke	1
his	1
girths	1
and	1
left	1
him	1
naked	1
without	1
a	1
saddle	1
to	1
cover	1
him;	1
but	1
what	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
worse	1
to	1
him	1
was	1
that	1
the	1
carriers,	1
seeing	1
the	1
violence	1
he	1
was	1
offering	1
to	1
their	1
mares,	1
came	1
running	1
up	1
armed	1
with	1
stakes,	1
and	1
so	1
belaboured	1
him	1
that	1
they	1
brought	1
him	1
sorely	1
battered	1
to	1
the	1
ground.	1
By	1
this	1
time	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
and	1
Sancho,	1
who	1
had	1
witnessed	1
the	1
drubbing	1
of	1
Rocinante,	1
came	1
up	1
panting,	1
and	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
to	1
Sancho:	1
“So	1
far	1
as	1
I	1
can	1
see,	1
friend	1
Sancho,	1
these	1
are	1
not	1
knights	1
but	1
base	1
folk	1
of	1
low	1
birth:	1
I	1
mention	1
it	1
because	1
thou	1
canst	1
lawfully	1
aid	1
me	1
in	1
taking	1
due	1
vengeance	1
for	1
the	1
insult	1
offered	1
to	1
Rocinante	1
before	1
our	1
eyes.”	1
“What	1
the	1
devil	1
vengeance	1
can	1
we	1
take,”	1
answered	1
Sancho,	1
“if	1
they	1
are	1
more	1
than	1
twenty,	1
and	1
we	1
no	1
more	1
than	1
two,	1
or,	1
indeed,	1
perhaps	1
not	1
more	1
than	1
one	1
and	1
a	1
half?”	1
“I	1
count	1
for	1
a	1
hundred,”	1
replied	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
and	1
without	1
more	1
words	1
he	1
drew	1
his	1
sword	1
and	1
attacked	1
the	1
Yanguesans	1
and	1
excited	1
and	1
impelled	1
by	1
the	1
example	1
of	1
his	1
master,	1
Sancho	1
did	1
the	1
same;	1
and	1
to	1
begin	1
with,	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
delivered	1
a	1
slash	1
at	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
laid	1
open	1
the	1
leather	1
jerkin	1
he	1
wore,	1
together	1
with	1
a	1
great	1
portion	1
of	1
his	1
shoulder.	1
The	1
Yanguesans,	1
seeing	1
themselves	1
assaulted	1
by	1
only	1
two	1
men	1
while	1
they	1
were	1
so	1
many,	1
betook	1
themselves	1
to	1
their	1
stakes,	1
and	1
driving	1
the	1
two	1
into	1
the	1
middle	1
they	1
began	1
to	1
lay	1
on	1
with	1
great	1
zeal	1
and	1
energy;	1
in	1
fact,	1
at	1
the	1
second	1
blow	1
they	1
brought	1
Sancho	1
to	1
the	1
ground,	1
and	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
fared	1
the	1
same	1
way,	1
all	1
his	1
skill	1
and	1
high	1
mettle	1
availing	1
him	1
nothing,	1
and	1
fate	1
willed	1
it	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
fall	1
at	1
the	1
feet	1
of	1
Rocinante,	1
who	1
had	1
not	1
yet	1
risen;	1
whereby	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
seen	1
how	1
furiously	1
stakes	1
can	1
pound	1
in	1
angry	1
boorish	1
hands.	1

Then,	1
seeing	1
the	1
mischief	1
they	1
had	1
done,	1
the	1
Yanguesans	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
haste	1
they	1
could	1
loaded	1
their	1
team	1
and	1
pursued	1
their	1
journey,	1
leaving	1
the	1
two	1
adventurers	1
a	1
sorry	1
sight	1
and	1
in	1
sorrier	1
mood.	1
Sancho	1
was	1
the	1
first	1
to	1
come	1
to,	1
and	1
finding	1
himself	1
close	1
to	1
his	1
master	1
he	1
called	1
to	1
him	1
in	1
a	1
weak	1
and	1
doleful	1
voice,	1
“Señor	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
ah,	1
Señor	1
Don	1
Quixote!”	1
“What	1
wouldst	1
thou,	1
brother	1
Sancho?”	1
answered	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
feeble	1
suffering	1
tone	1
as	1
Sancho.	1
“I	1
would	1
like,	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
possible,”	1
answered	1
Sancho	1
Panza,	1
“your	1
worship	1
to	1
give	1
me	1
a	1
couple	1
of	1
sups	1
of	1
that	1
potion	1
of	1
the	1
fiery	1
Blas,	1
if	1
it	1
be	1
that	1
you	1
have	1
any	1
to	1
hand	1
there;	1
perhaps	1
it	1
will	1
serve	1
for	1
broken	1
bones	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
for	1
wounds.”	1
“If	1
I	1
only	1
had	1
it	1
here,	1
wretch	1
that	1
I	1
am,	1
what	1
more	1
should	1
we	1
want?”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
“but	1
I	1
swear	1
to	1
thee,	1
Sancho	1
Panza,	1
on	1
the	1
faith	1
of	1
a	1
knight-errant,	1
ere	1
two	1
days	1
are	1
over,	1
unless	1
fortune	1
orders	1
otherwise,	1
I	1
mean	1
to	1
have	1
it	1
in	1
my	1
possession,	1
or	1
my	1
hand	1
will	1
have	1
lost	1
its	1
cunning.”	1
“But	1
in	1
how	1
many	1
does	1
your	1
worship	1
think	1
we	1
shall	1
have	1
the	1
use	1
of	1
our	1
feet?”	1
answered	1
Sancho	1
Panza.	1
“For	1
myself	1
I	1
must	1
say	1
I	1
cannot	1
guess	1
how	1
many,”	1
said	1
the	1
battered	1
knight	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
“but	1
I	1
take	1
all	1
the	1
blame	1
upon	1
myself,	1
for	1
I	1
had	1
no	1
business	1
to	1
put	1
hand	1
to	1
sword	1
against	1
men	1
who	1
where	1
not	1
dubbed	1
knights	1
like	1
myself,	1
and	1
so	1
I	1
believe	1
that	1
in	1
punishment	1
for	1
having	1
transgressed	1
the	1
laws	1
of	1
chivalry	1
the	1
God	1
of	1
battles	1
has	1
permitted	1
this	1
chastisement	1
to	1
be	1
administered	1
to	1
me;	1
for	1
which	1
reason,	1
brother	1
Sancho,	1
it	1
is	1
well	1
thou	1
shouldst	1
receive	1
a	1
hint	1
on	1
the	1
matter	1
which	1
I	1
am	1
now	1
about	1
to	1
mention	1
to	1
thee,	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
of	1
much	1
importance	1
to	1
the	1
welfare	1
of	1
both	1
of	1
us.	1
It	1
is	1
at	1
when	1
thou	1
shalt	1
see	1
rabble	1
of	1
this	1
sort	1
offering	1
us	1
insult	1
thou	1
art	1
not	1
to	1
wait	1
till	1
I	1
draw	1
sword	1
against	1
them,	1
for	1
I	1
shall	1
not	1
do	1
so	1
at	1
all;	1
but	1
do	1
thou	1
draw	1
sword	1
and	1
chastise	1
them	1
to	1
thy	1
heart’s	1
content,	1
and	1
if	1
any	1
knights	1
come	1
to	1
their	1
aid	1
and	1
defence	1
I	1
will	1
take	1
care	1
to	1
defend	1
thee	1
and	1
assail	1
them	1
with	1
all	1
my	1
might;	1
and	1
thou	1
hast	1
already	1
seen	1
by	1
a	1
thousand	1
signs	1
and	1
proofs	1
what	1
the	1
might	1
of	1
this	1
strong	1
arm	1
of	1
mine	1
is	1
equal	1
to”—so	1
uplifted	1
had	1
the	1
poor	1
gentleman	1
become	1
through	1
the	1
victory	1
over	1
the	1
stout	1
Biscayan.	1
But	1
Sancho	1
did	1
not	1
so	1
fully	1
approve	1
of	1
his	1
master’s	1
admonition	1
as	1
to	1
let	1
it	1
pass	1
without	1
saying	1
in	1
reply,	1
“Señor,	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
peace,	1
meek	1
and	1
quiet,	1
and	1
I	1
can	1
put	1
up	1
with	1
any	1
affront	1
because	1
I	1
have	1
a	1
wife	1
and	1
children	1
to	1
support	1
and	1
bring	1
up;	1
so	1
let	1
it	1
be	1
likewise	1
a	1
hint	1
to	1
your	1
worship,	1
as	1
it	1
cannot	1
be	1
a	1
mandate,	1
that	1
on	1
no	1
account	1
will	1
I	1
draw	1
sword	1
either	1
against	1
clown	1
or	1
against	1
knight,	1
and	1
that	1
here	1
before	1
God	1
I	1
forgive	1
the	1
insults	1
that	1
have	1
been	1
offered	1
me,	1
whether	1
they	1
have	1
been,	1
are,	1
or	1
shall	1
be	1
offered	1
me	1
by	1
high	1
or	1
low,	1
rich	1
or	1
poor,	1
noble	1
or	1
commoner,	1
not	1
excepting	1
any	1
rank	1
or	1
condition	1
whatsoever.”	1
To	1
all	1
which	1
his	1
master	1
said	1
in	1
reply,	1
“I	1
wish	1
I	1
had	1
breath	1
enough	1
to	1
speak	1
somewhat	1
easily,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
pain	1
I	1
feel	1
on	1
this	1
side	1
would	1
abate	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
let	1
me	1
explain	1
to	1
thee,	1
Panza,	1
the	1
mistake	1
thou	1
makest.	1
Come	1
now,	1
sinner,	1
suppose	1
the	1
wind	1
of	1
fortune,	1
hitherto	1
so	1
adverse,	1
should	1
turn	1
in	1
our	1
favour,	1
filling	1
the	1
sails	1
of	1
our	1
desires	1
so	1
that	1
safely	1
and	1
without	1
impediment	1
we	1
put	1
into	1
port	1
in	1
some	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
islands	1
I	1
have	1
promised	1
thee,	1
how	1
would	1
it	1
be	1
with	1
thee	1
if	1
on	1
winning	1
it	1
I	1
made	1
thee	1
lord	1
of	1
it?	1
Why,	1
thou	1
wilt	1
make	1
it	1
well-nigh	1
impossible	1
through	1
not	1
being	1
a	1
knight	1
nor	1
having	1
any	1
desire	1
to	1
be	1
one,	1
nor	1
possessing	1
the	1
courage	1
nor	1
the	1
will	1
to	1
avenge	1
insults	1
or	1
defend	1
thy	1
lordship;	1
for	1
thou	1
must	1
know	1
that	1
in	1
newly	1
conquered	1
kingdoms	1
and	1
provinces	1
the	1
minds	1
of	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
are	1
never	1
so	1
quiet	1
nor	1
so	1
well	1
disposed	1
to	1
the	1
new	1
lord	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
fear	1
of	1
their	1
making	1
some	1
move	1
to	1
change	1
matters	1
once	1
more,	1
and	1
try,	1
as	1
they	1
say,	1
what	1
chance	1
may	1
do	1
for	1
them;	1
so	1
it	1
is	1
essential	1
that	1
the	1
new	1
possessor	1
should	1
have	1
good	1
sense	1
to	1
enable	1
him	1
to	1
govern,	1
and	1
valour	1
to	1
attack	1
and	1
defend	1
himself,	1
whatever	1
may	1
befall	1
him.”	1
“In	1
what	1
has	1
now	1
befallen	1
us,”	1
answered	1
Sancho,	1
“I’d	1
have	1
been	1
well	1
pleased	1
to	1
have	1
that	1
good	1
sense	1
and	1
that	1
valour	1
your	1
worship	1
speaks	1
of,	1
but	1
I	1
swear	1
on	1
the	1
faith	1
of	1
a	1
poor	1
man	1
I	1
am	1
more	1
fit	1
for	1
plasters	1
than	1
for	1
arguments.	1
See	1
if	1
your	1
worship	1
can	1
get	1
up,	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
help	1
Rocinante,	1
though	1
he	1
does	1
not	1
deserve	1
it,	1
for	1
he	1
was	1
the	1
main	1
cause	1
of	1
all	1
this	1
thrashing.	1
I	1
never	1
thought	1
it	1
of	1
Rocinante,	1
for	1
I	1
took	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
virtuous	1
person	1
and	1
as	1
quiet	1
as	1
myself.	1
After	1
all,	1
they	1
say	1
right	1
that	1
it	1
takes	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
know	1
people,	1
and	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
nothing	1
sure	1
in	1
this	1
life.	1
Who	1
would	1
have	1
said	1
that,	1
after	1
such	1
mighty	1
slashes	1
as	1
your	1
worship	1
gave	1
that	1
unlucky	1
knight-errant,	1
there	1
was	1
coming,	1
travelling	1
post	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
very	1
heels	1
of	1
them,	1
such	1
a	1
great	1
storm	1
of	1
sticks	1
as	1
has	1
fallen	1
upon	1
our	1
shoulders?”	1
“And	1
yet	1
thine,	1
Sancho,”	1
replied	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“ought	1
to	1
be	1
used	1
to	1
such	1
squalls;	1
but	1
mine,	1
reared	1
in	1
soft	1
cloth	1
and	1
fine	1
linen,	1
it	1
is	1
plain	1
they	1
must	1
feel	1
more	1
keenly	1
the	1
pain	1
of	1
this	1
mishap,	1
and	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
not	1
that	1
I	1
imagine—why	1
do	1
I	1
say	1
imagine?—know	1
of	1
a	1
certainty	1
that	1
all	1
these	1
annoyances	1
are	1
very	1
necessary	1
accompaniments	1
of	1
the	1
calling	1
of	1
arms,	1
I	1
would	1
lay	1
me	1
down	1
here	1
to	1
die	1
of	1
pure	1
vexation.”	1
To	1
this	1
the	1
squire	1
replied,	1
“Señor,	1
as	1
these	1
mishaps	1
are	1
what	1
one	1
reaps	1
of	1
chivalry,	1
tell	1
me	1
if	1
they	1
happen	1
very	1
often,	1
or	1
if	1
they	1
have	1
their	1
own	1
fixed	1
times	1
for	1
coming	1
to	1
pass;	1
because	1
it	1
seems	1
to	1
me	1
that	1
after	1
two	1
harvests	1
we	1
shall	1
be	1
no	1
good	1
for	1
the	1
third,	1
unless	1
God	1
in	1
his	1
infinite	1
mercy	1
helps	1
us.”	1
“Know,	1
friend	1
Sancho,”	1
answered	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“that	1
the	1
life	1
of	1
knights-errant	1
is	1
subject	1
to	1
a	1
thousand	1
dangers	1
and	1
reverses,	1
and	1
neither	1
more	1
nor	1
less	1
is	1
it	1
within	1
immediate	1
possibility	1
for	1
knights-errant	1
to	1
become	1
kings	1
and	1
emperors,	1
as	1
experience	1
has	1
shown	1
in	1
the	1
case	1
of	1
many	1
different	1
knights	1
with	1
whose	1
histories	1
I	1
am	1
thoroughly	1
acquainted;	1
and	1
I	1
could	1
tell	1
thee	1
now,	1
if	1
the	1
pain	1
would	1
let	1
me,	1
of	1
some	1
who	1
simply	1
by	1
might	1
of	1
arm	1
have	1
risen	1
to	1
the	1
high	1
stations	1
I	1
have	1
mentioned;	1
and	1
those	1
same,	1
both	1
before	1
and	1
after,	1
experienced	1
divers	1
misfortunes	1
and	1
miseries;	1
for	1
the	1
valiant	1
Amadis	1
of	1
Gaul	1
found	1
himself	1
in	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
his	1
mortal	1
enemy	1
Arcalaus	1
the	1
magician,	1
who,	1
it	1
is	1
positively	1
asserted,	1
holding	1
him	1
captive,	1
gave	1
him	1
more	1
than	1
two	1
hundred	1
lashes	1
with	1
the	1
reins	1
of	1
his	1
horse	1
while	1
tied	1
to	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
pillars	1
of	1
a	1
court;	1
and	1
moreover	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
certain	1
recondite	1
author	1
of	1
no	1
small	1
authority	1
who	1
says	1
that	1
the	1
Knight	1
of	1
Phœbus,	1
being	1
caught	1
in	1
a	1
certain	1
pitfall,	1
which	1
opened	1
under	1
his	1
feet	1
in	1
a	1
certain	1
castle,	1
on	1
falling	1
found	1
himself	1
bound	1
hand	1
and	1
foot	1
in	1
a	1
deep	1
pit	1
underground,	1
where	1
they	1
administered	1
to	1
him	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
things	1
they	1
call	1
clysters,	1
of	1
sand	1
and	1
snow-water,	1
that	1
well-nigh	1
finished	1
him;	1
and	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
succoured	1
in	1
that	1
sore	1
extremity	1
by	1
a	1
sage,	1
a	1
great	1
friend	1
of	1
his,	1
it	1
would	1
have	1
gone	1
very	1
hard	1
with	1
the	1
poor	1
knight;	1
so	1
I	1
may	1
well	1
suffer	1
in	1
company	1
with	1
such	1
worthy	1
folk,	1
for	1
greater	1
were	1
the	1
indignities	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
to	1
suffer	1
than	1
those	1
which	1
we	1
suffer.	1
For	1
I	1
would	1
have	1
thee	1
know,	1
Sancho,	1
that	1
wounds	1
caused	1
by	1
any	1
instruments	1
which	1
happen	1
by	1
chance	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
hand	1
inflict	1
no	1
indignity,	1
and	1
this	1
is	1
laid	1
down	1
in	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
the	1
duel	1
in	1
express	1
words:	1
if,	1
for	1
instance,	1
the	1
cobbler	1
strikes	1
another	1
with	1
the	1
last	1
which	1
he	1
has	1
in	1
his	1
hand,	1
though	1
it	1
be	1
in	1
fact	1
a	1
piece	1
of	1
wood,	1
it	1
cannot	1
be	1
said	1
for	1
that	1
reason	1
that	1
he	1
whom	1
he	1
struck	1
with	1
it	1
has	1
been	1
cudgelled.	1
I	1
say	1
this	1
lest	1
thou	1
shouldst	1
imagine	1
that	1
because	1
we	1
have	1
been	1
drubbed	1
in	1
this	1
affray	1
we	1
have	1
therefore	1
suffered	1
any	1
indignity;	1
for	1
the	1
arms	1
those	1
men	1
carried,	1
with	1
which	1
they	1
pounded	1
us,	1
were	1
nothing	1
more	1
than	1
their	1
stakes,	1
and	1
not	1
one	1
of	1
them,	1
so	1
far	1
as	1
I	1
remember,	1
carried	1
rapier,	1
sword,	1
or	1
dagger.”	1
“They	1
gave	1
me	1
no	1
time	1
to	1
see	1
that	1
much,”	1
answered	1
Sancho,	1
“for	1
hardly	1
had	1
I	1
laid	1
hand	1
on	1
my	1
tizona	1
when	1
they	1
signed	1
the	1
cross	1
on	1
my	1
shoulders	1
with	1
their	1
sticks	1
in	1
such	1
style	1
that	1
they	1
took	1
the	1
sight	1
out	1
of	1
my	1
eyes	1
and	1
the	1
strength	1
out	1
of	1
my	1
feet,	1
stretching	1
me	1
where	1
I	1
now	1
lie,	1
and	1
where	1
thinking	1
of	1
whether	1
all	1
those	1
stake-strokes	1
were	1
an	1
indignity	1
or	1
not	1
gives	1
me	1
no	1
uneasiness,	1
which	1
the	1
pain	1
of	1
the	1
blows	1
does,	1
for	1
they	1
will	1
remain	1
as	1
deeply	1
impressed	1
on	1
my	1
memory	1
as	1
on	1
my	1
shoulders.”	1
“For	1
all	1
that	1
let	1
me	1
tell	1
thee,	1
brother	1
Panza,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“that	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
recollection	1
which	1
time	1
does	1
not	1
put	1
an	1
end	1
to,	1
and	1
no	1
pain	1
which	1
death	1
does	1
not	1
remove.”	1
“And	1
what	1
greater	1
misfortune	1
can	1
there	1
be,”	1
replied	1
Panza,	1
“than	1
the	1
one	1
that	1
waits	1
for	1
time	1
to	1
put	1
an	1
end	1
to	1
it	1
and	1
death	1
to	1
remove	1
it?	1
If	1
our	1
mishap	1
were	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
that	1
are	1
cured	1
with	1
a	1
couple	1
of	1
plasters,	1
it	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
so	1
bad;	1
but	1
I	1
am	1
beginning	1
to	1
think	1
that	1
all	1
the	1
plasters	1
in	1
a	1
hospital	1
almost	1
won’t	1
be	1
enough	1
to	1
put	1
us	1
right.”	1
“No	1
more	1
of	1
that:	1
pluck	1
strength	1
out	1
of	1
weakness,	1
Sancho,	1
as	1
I	1
mean	1
to	1
do,”	1
returned	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“and	1
let	1
us	1
see	1
how	1
Rocinante	1
is,	1
for	1
it	1
seems	1
to	1
me	1
that	1
not	1
the	1
least	1
share	1
of	1
this	1
mishap	1
has	1
fallen	1
to	1
the	1
lot	1
of	1
the	1
poor	1
beast.”	1
“There	1
is	1
nothing	1
wonderful	1
in	1
that,”	1
replied	1
Sancho,	1
“since	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
knight-errant	1
too;	1
what	1
I	1
wonder	1
at	1
is	1
that	1
my	1
beast	1
should	1
have	1
come	1
off	1
scot-free	1
where	1
we	1
come	1
out	1
scotched.”	1
“Fortune	1
always	1
leaves	1
a	1
door	1
open	1
in	1
adversity	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
bring	1
relief	1
to	1
it,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
“I	1
say	1
so	1
because	1
this	1
little	1
beast	1
may	1
now	1
supply	1
the	1
want	1
of	1
Rocinante,	1
carrying	1
me	1
hence	1
to	1
some	1
castle	1
where	1
I	1
may	1
be	1
cured	1
of	1
my	1
wounds.	1
And	1
moreover	1
I	1
shall	1
not	1
hold	1
it	1
any	1
dishonour	1
to	1
be	1
so	1
mounted,	1
for	1
I	1
remember	1
having	1
read	1
how	1
the	1
good	1
old	1
Silenus,	1
the	1
tutor	1
and	1
instructor	1
of	1
the	1
gay	1
god	1
of	1
laughter,	1
when	1
he	1
entered	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
the	1
hundred	1
gates,	1
went	1
very	1
contentedly	1
mounted	1
on	1
a	1
handsome	1
ass.”	1
“It	1
may	1
be	1
true	1
that	1
he	1
went	1
mounted	1
as	1
your	1
worship	1
says,”	1
answered	1
Sancho,	1
“but	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
great	1
difference	1
between	1
going	1
mounted	1
and	1
going	1
slung	1
like	1
a	1
sack	1
of	1
manure.”	1
To	1
which	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
replied,	1
“Wounds	1
received	1
in	1
battle	1
confer	1
honour	1
instead	1
of	1
taking	1
it	1
away;	1
and	1
so,	1
friend	1
Panza,	1
say	1
no	1
more,	1
but,	1
as	1
I	1
told	1
thee	1
before,	1
get	1
up	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
thou	1
canst	1
and	1
put	1
me	1
on	1
top	1
of	1
thy	1
beast	1
in	1
whatever	1
fashion	1
pleases	1
thee	1
best,	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
go	1
hence	1
ere	1
night	1
come	1
on	1
and	1
surprise	1
us	1
in	1
these	1
wilds.”	1
“And	1
yet	1
I	1
have	1
heard	1
your	1
worship	1
say,”	1
observed	1
Panza,	1
“that	1
it	1
is	1
very	1
meet	1
for	1
knights-errant	1
to	1
sleep	1
in	1
wastes	1
and	1
deserts,	1
and	1
that	1
they	1
esteem	1
it	1
very	1
good	1
fortune.”	1
“That	1
is,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“when	1
they	1
cannot	1
help	1
it,	1
or	1
when	1
they	1
are	1
in	1
love;	1
and	1
so	1
true	1
is	1
this	1
that	1
there	1
have	1
been	1
knights	1
who	1
have	1
remained	1
two	1
years	1
on	1
rocks,	1
in	1
sunshine	1
and	1
shade	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
inclemencies	1
of	1
heaven,	1
without	1
their	1
ladies	1
knowing	1
anything	1
of	1
it;	1
and	1
one	1
of	1
these	1
was	1
Amadis,	1
when,	1
under	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Beltenebros,	1
he	1
took	1
up	1
his	1
abode	1
on	1
the	1
Peña	1
Pobre	1
for—I	1
know	1
not	1
if	1
it	1
was	1
eight	1
years	1
or	1
eight	1
months,	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
very	1
sure	1
of	1
the	1
reckoning;	1
at	1
any	1
rate	1
he	1
stayed	1
there	1
doing	1
penance	1
for	1
I	1
know	1
not	1
what	1
pique	1
the	1
Princess	1
Oriana	1
had	1
against	1
him;	1
but	1
no	1
more	1
of	1
this	1
now,	1
Sancho,	1
and	1
make	1
haste	1
before	1
a	1
mishap	1
like	1
Rocinante’s	1
befalls	1
the	1
ass.”	1
“The	1
very	1
devil	1
would	1
be	1
in	1
it	1
in	1
that	1
case,”	1
said	1
Sancho;	1
and	1
letting	1
off	1
thirty	1
“ohs,”	1
and	1
sixty	1
sighs,	1
and	1
a	1
hundred	1
and	1
twenty	1
maledictions	1
and	1
execrations	1
on	1
whomsoever	1
it	1
was	1
that	1
had	1
brought	1
him	1
there,	1
he	1
raised	1
himself,	1
stopping	1
half-way	1
bent	1
like	1
a	1
Turkish	1
bow	1
without	1
power	1
to	1
bring	1
himself	1
upright,	1
but	1
with	1
all	1
his	1
pains	1
he	1
saddled	1
his	1
ass,	1
who	1
too	1
had	1
gone	1
astray	1
somewhat,	1
yielding	1
to	1
the	1
excessive	1
licence	1
of	1
the	1
day;	1
he	1
next	1
raised	1
up	1
Rocinante,	1
and	1
as	1
for	1
him,	1
had	1
he	1
possessed	1
a	1
tongue	1
to	1
complain	1
with,	1
most	1
assuredly	1
neither	1
Sancho	1
nor	1
his	1
master	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
behind	1
him.	1

might	1
be;	1
and,	1
as	1
chance	1
was	1
conducting	1
their	1
affairs	1
for	1
them	1
from	1
good	1
to	1
better,	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
gone	1
a	1
short	1
league	1
when	1
the	1
road	1
came	1
in	1
sight,	1
and	1
on	1
it	1
he	1
perceived	1
an	1
inn,	1
which	1
to	1
his	1
annoyance	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
delight	1
of	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
must	1
needs	1
be	1
a	1
castle.	1
Sancho	1
insisted	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
an	1
inn,	1
and	1
his	1
master	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
one,	1
but	1
a	1
castle,	1
and	1
the	1
dispute	1
lasted	1
so	1
long	1
that	1
before	1
the	1
point	1
was	1
settled	1
they	1
had	1
time	1
to	1
reach	1
it,	1
and	1
into	1
it	1
Sancho	1
entered	1
with	1
all	1
his	1
team	1
without	1
any	1
further	1
controversy.	1

The	1
innkeeper,	1
seeing	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
slung	1
across	1
the	1
ass,	1
asked	1
Sancho	1
what	1
was	1
amiss	1
with	1
him.	1
Sancho	1
answered	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
nothing,	1
only	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
fallen	1
down	1
from	1
a	1
rock	1
and	1
had	1
his	1
ribs	1
a	1
little	1
bruised.	1
The	1
innkeeper	1
had	1
a	1
wife	1
whose	1
disposition	1
was	1
not	1
such	1
as	1
those	1
of	1
her	1
calling	1
commonly	1
have,	1
for	1
she	1
was	1
by	1
nature	1
kind-hearted	1
and	1
felt	1
for	1
the	1
sufferings	1
of	1
her	1
neighbours,	1
so	1
she	1
at	1
once	1
set	1
about	1
tending	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
and	1
made	1
her	1
young	1
daughter,	1
a	1
very	1
comely	1
girl,	1
help	1
her	1
in	1
taking	1
care	1
of	1
her	1
guest.	1
There	1
was	1
besides	1
in	1
the	1
inn,	1
as	1
servant,	1
an	1
Asturian	1
lass	1
with	1
a	1
broad	1
face,	1
flat	1
poll,	1
and	1
snub	1
nose,	1
blind	1
of	1
one	1
eye	1
and	1
not	1
very	1
sound	1
in	1
the	1
other.	1
The	1
elegance	1
of	1
her	1
shape,	1
to	1
be	1
sure,	1
made	1
up	1
for	1
all	1
her	1
defects;	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
measure	1
seven	1
palms	1
from	1
head	1
to	1
foot,	1
and	1
her	1
shoulders,	1
which	1
overweighted	1
her	1
somewhat,	1
made	1
her	1
contemplate	1
the	1
ground	1
more	1
than	1
she	1
liked.	1
This	1
graceful	1
lass,	1
then,	1
helped	1
the	1
young	1
girl,	1
and	1
the	1
two	1
made	1
up	1
a	1
very	1
bad	1
bed	1
for	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
in	1
a	1
garret	1
that	1
showed	1
evident	1
signs	1
of	1
having	1
formerly	1
served	1
for	1
many	1
years	1
as	1
a	1
straw-loft,	1
in	1
which	1
there	1
was	1
also	1
quartered	1
a	1
carrier	1
whose	1
bed	1
was	1
placed	1
a	1
little	1
beyond	1
our	1
Don	1
Quixote’s,	1
and,	1
though	1
only	1
made	1
of	1
the	1
pack-saddles	1
and	1
cloths	1
of	1
his	1
mules,	1
had	1
much	1
the	1
advantage	1
of	1
it,	1
as	1
Don	1
Quixote’s	1
consisted	1
simply	1
of	1
four	1
rough	1
boards	1
on	1
two	1
not	1
very	1
even	1
trestles,	1
a	1
mattress,	1
that	1
for	1
thinness	1
might	1
have	1
passed	1
for	1
a	1
quilt,	1
full	1
of	1
pellets	1
which,	1
were	1
they	1
not	1
seen	1
through	1
the	1
rents	1
to	1
be	1
wool,	1
would	1
to	1
the	1
touch	1
have	1
seemed	1
pebbles	1
in	1
hardness,	1
two	1
sheets	1
made	1
of	1
buckler	1
leather,	1
and	1
a	1
coverlet	1
the	1
threads	1
of	1
which	1
anyone	1
that	1
chose	1
might	1
have	1
counted	1
without	1
missing	1
one	1
in	1
the	1
reckoning.	1
On	1
this	1
accursed	1
bed	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
stretched	1
himself,	1
and	1
the	1
hostess	1
and	1
her	1
daughter	1
soon	1
covered	1
him	1
with	1
plasters	1
from	1
top	1
to	1
toe,	1
while	1
Maritornes—for	1
that	1
was	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
Asturian—held	1
the	1
light	1
for	1
them,	1
and	1
while	1
plastering	1
him,	1
the	1
hostess,	1
observing	1
how	1
full	1
of	1
wheals	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
was	1
in	1
some	1
places,	1
remarked	1
that	1
this	1
had	1
more	1
the	1
look	1
of	1
blows	1
than	1
of	1
a	1
fall.	1
It	1
was	1
not	1
blows,	1
Sancho	1
said,	1
but	1
that	1
the	1
rock	1
had	1
many	1
points	1
and	1
projections,	1
and	1
that	1
each	1
of	1
them	1
had	1
left	1
its	1
mark.	1
“Pray,	1
señora,”	1
he	1
added,	1
“manage	1
to	1
save	1
some	1
tow,	1
as	1
there	1
will	1
be	1
no	1
want	1
of	1
someone	1
to	1
use	1
it,	1
for	1
my	1
loins	1
too	1
are	1
rather	1
sore.”	1
“Then	1
you	1
must	1
have	1
fallen	1
too,”	1
said	1
the	1
hostess.	1
“I	1
did	1
not	1
fall,”	1
said	1
Sancho	1
Panza,	1
“but	1
from	1
the	1
shock	1
I	1
got	1
at	1
seeing	1
my	1
master	1
fall,	1
my	1
body	1
aches	1
so	1
that	1
I	1
feel	1
as	1
if	1
I	1
had	1
had	1
a	1
thousand	1
thwacks.”	1
“That	1
may	1
well	1
be,”	1
said	1
the	1
young	1
girl,	1
“for	1
it	1
has	1
many	1
a	1
time	1
happened	1
to	1
me	1
to	1
dream	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
falling	1
down	1
from	1
a	1
tower	1
and	1
never	1
coming	1
to	1
the	1
ground,	1
and	1
when	1
I	1
awoke	1
from	1
the	1
dream	1
to	1
find	1
myself	1
as	1
weak	1
and	1
shaken	1
as	1
if	1
I	1
had	1
really	1
fallen.”	1
“There	1
is	1
the	1
point,	1
señora,”	1
replied	1
Sancho	1
Panza,	1
“that	1
I	1
without	1
dreaming	1
at	1
all,	1
but	1
being	1
more	1
awake	1
than	1
I	1
am	1
now,	1
find	1
myself	1
with	1
scarcely	1
less	1
wheals	1
than	1
my	1
master,	1
Don	1
Quixote.”	1
“How	1
is	1
the	1
gentleman	1
called?”	1
asked	1
Maritornes	1
the	1
Asturian.	1
“Don	1
Quixote	1
of	1
La	1
Mancha,”	1
answered	1
Sancho	1
Panza,	1
“and	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
knight-adventurer,	1
and	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
best	1
and	1
stoutest	1
that	1
have	1
been	1
seen	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
this	1
long	1
time	1
past.”	1
“What	1
is	1
a	1
knight-adventurer?”	1
said	1
the	1
lass.	1
“Are	1
you	1
so	1
new	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
as	1
not	1
to	1
know?”	1
answered	1
Sancho	1
Panza.	1
“Well,	1
then,	1
you	1
must	1
know,	1
sister,	1
that	1
a	1
knight-adventurer	1
is	1
a	1
thing	1
that	1
in	1
two	1
words	1
is	1
seen	1
drubbed	1
and	1
emperor,	1
that	1
is	1
to-day	1
the	1
most	1
miserable	1
and	1
needy	1
being	1
in	1
the	1
world,	1
and	1
to-morrow	1
will	1
have	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
crowns	1
of	1
kingdoms	1
to	1
give	1
his	1
squire.”	1
“Then	1
how	1
is	1
it,”	1
said	1
the	1
hostess,	1
“that	1
belonging	1
to	1
so	1
good	1
a	1
master	1
as	1
this,	1
you	1
have	1
not,	1
to	1
judge	1
by	1
appearances,	1
even	1
so	1
much	1
as	1
a	1
county?”	1
“It	1
is	1
too	1
soon	1
yet,”	1
answered	1
Sancho,	1
“for	1
we	1
have	1
only	1
been	1
a	1
month	1
going	1
in	1
quest	1
of	1
adventures,	1
and	1
so	1
far	1
we	1
have	1
met	1
with	1
nothing	1
that	1
can	1
be	1
called	1
one,	1
for	1
it	1
will	1
happen	1
that	1
when	1
one	1
thing	1
is	1
looked	1
for	1
another	1
thing	1
is	1
found;	1
however,	1
if	1
my	1
master	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
gets	1
well	1
of	1
this	1
wound,	1
or	1
fall,	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
left	1
none	1
the	1
worse	1
of	1
it,	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
change	1
my	1
hopes	1
for	1
the	1
best	1
title	1
in	1
Spain.”	1
To	1
all	1
this	1
conversation	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
was	1
listening	1
very	1
attentively,	1
and	1
sitting	1
up	1
in	1
bed	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
he	1
could,	1
and	1
taking	1
the	1
hostess	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
her,	1
“Believe	1
me,	1
fair	1
lady,	1
you	1
may	1
call	1
yourself	1
fortunate	1
in	1
having	1
in	1
this	1
castle	1
of	1
yours	1
sheltered	1
my	1
person,	1
which	1
is	1
such	1
that	1
if	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
myself	1
praise	1
it,	1
it	1
is	1
because	1
of	1
what	1
is	1
commonly	1
said,	1
that	1
self-praise	1
debaseth;	1
but	1
my	1
squire	1
will	1
inform	1
you	1
who	1
I	1
am.	1
I	1
only	1
tell	1
you	1
that	1
I	1
shall	1
preserve	1
for	1
ever	1
inscribed	1
on	1
my	1
memory	1
the	1
service	1
you	1
have	1
rendered	1
me	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
tender	1
you	1
my	1
gratitude	1
while	1
life	1
shall	1
last	1
me;	1
and	1
would	1
to	1
Heaven	1
love	1
held	1
me	1
not	1
so	1
enthralled	1
and	1
subject	1
to	1
its	1
laws	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
that	1
fair	1
ingrate	1
whom	1
I	1
name	1
between	1
my	1
teeth,	1
but	1
that	1
those	1
of	1
this	1
lovely	1
damsel	1
might	1
be	1
the	1
masters	1
of	1
my	1
liberty.”	1
The	1
hostess,	1
her	1
daughter,	1
and	1
the	1
worthy	1
Maritornes	1
listened	1
in	1
bewilderment	1
to	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
knight-errant;	1
for	1
they	1
understood	1
about	1
as	1
much	1
of	1
them	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
talking	1
Greek,	1
though	1
they	1
could	1
perceive	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
meant	1
for	1
expressions	1
of	1
good-will	1
and	1
blandishments;	1
and	1
not	1
being	1
accustomed	1
to	1
this	1
kind	1
of	1
language,	1
they	1
stared	1
at	1
him	1
and	1
wondered	1
to	1
themselves,	1
for	1
he	1
seemed	1
to	1
them	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
a	1
different	1
sort	1
from	1
those	1
they	1
were	1
used	1
to,	1
and	1
thanking	1
him	1
in	1
pothouse	1
phrase	1
for	1
his	1
civility	1
they	1
left	1
him,	1
while	1
the	1
Asturian	1
gave	1
her	1
attention	1
to	1
Sancho,	1
who	1
needed	1
it	1
no	1
less	1
than	1
his	1
master.	1
The	1
carrier	1
had	1
made	1
an	1
arrangement	1
with	1
her	1
for	1
recreation	1
that	1
night,	1
and	1
she	1
had	1
given	1
him	1
her	1
word	1
that	1
when	1
the	1
guests	1
were	1
quiet	1
and	1
the	1
family	1
asleep	1
she	1
would	1
come	1
in	1
search	1
of	1
him	1
and	1
meet	1
his	1
wishes	1
unreservedly.	1
And	1
it	1
is	1
said	1
of	1
this	1
good	1
lass	1
that	1
she	1
never	1
made	1
promises	1
of	1
the	1
kind	1
without	1
fulfilling	1
them,	1
even	1
though	1
she	1
made	1
them	1
in	1
a	1
forest	1
and	1
without	1
any	1
witness	1
present,	1
for	1
she	1
plumed	1
herself	1
greatly	1
on	1
being	1
a	1
lady	1
and	1
held	1
it	1
no	1
disgrace	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
such	1
an	1
employment	1
as	1
servant	1
in	1
an	1
inn,	1
because,	1
she	1
said,	1
misfortunes	1
and	1
ill-luck	1
had	1
brought	1
her	1
to	1
that	1
position.	1
The	1
hard,	1
narrow,	1
wretched,	1
rickety	1
bed	1
of	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
stood	1
first	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
this	1
star-lit	1
stable,	1
and	1
close	1
beside	1
it	1
Sancho	1
made	1
his,	1
which	1
merely	1
consisted	1
of	1
a	1
rush	1
mat	1
and	1
a	1
blanket	1
that	1
looked	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
was	1
of	1
threadbare	1
canvas	1
rather	1
than	1
of	1
wool.	1
Next	1
to	1
these	1
two	1
beds	1
was	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
carrier,	1
made	1
up,	1
as	1
has	1
been	1
said,	1
of	1
the	1
pack-saddles	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
trappings	1
of	1
the	1
two	1
best	1
mules	1
he	1
had,	1
though	1
there	1
were	1
twelve	1
of	1
them,	1
sleek,	1
plump,	1
and	1
in	1
prime	1
condition,	1
for	1
he	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
rich	1
carriers	1
of	1
Arévalo,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
author	1
of	1
this	1
history,	1
who	1
particularly	1
mentions	1
this	1
carrier	1
because	1
he	1
knew	1
him	1
very	1
well,	1
and	1
they	1
even	1
say	1
was	1
in	1
some	1
degree	1
a	1
relation	1
of	1
his;	1
besides	1
which	1
Cid	1
Hamete	1
Benengeli	1
was	1
a	1
historian	1
of	1
great	1
research	1
and	1
accuracy	1
in	1
all	1
things,	1
as	1
is	1
very	1
evident	1
since	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
pass	1
over	1
in	1
silence	1
those	1
that	1
have	1
been	1
already	1
mentioned,	1
however	1
trifling	1
and	1
insignificant	1
they	1
might	1
be,	1
an	1
example	1
that	1
might	1
be	1
followed	1
by	1
those	1
grave	1
historians	1
who	1
relate	1
transactions	1
so	1
curtly	1
and	1
briefly	1
that	1
we	1
hardly	1
get	1
a	1
taste	1
of	1
them,	1
all	1
the	1
substance	1
of	1
the	1
work	1
being	1
left	1
in	1
the	1
inkstand	1
from	1
carelessness,	1
perverseness,	1
or	1
ignorance.	1
A	1
thousand	1
blessings	1
on	1
the	1
author	1
of	1
“Tablante	1
de	1
Ricamonte”	1
and	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
other	1
book	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
deeds	1
of	1
the	1
Conde	1
Tomillas	1
are	1
recounted;	1
with	1
what	1
minuteness	1
they	1
describe	1
everything!	1
To	1
proceed,	1
then:	1
after	1
having	1
paid	1
a	1
visit	1
to	1
his	1
team	1
and	1
given	1
them	1
their	1
second	1
feed,	1
the	1
carrier	1
stretched	1
himself	1
on	1
his	1
pack-saddles	1
and	1
lay	1
waiting	1
for	1
his	1
conscientious	1
Maritornes.	1
Sancho	1
was	1
by	1
this	1
time	1
plastered	1
and	1
had	1
lain	1
down,	1
and	1
though	1
he	1
strove	1
to	1

The	1
inn	1
was	1
all	1
in	1
silence,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
whole	1
of	1
it	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
light	1
except	1
that	1
given	1
by	1
a	1
lantern	1
that	1
hung	1
burning	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
gateway.	1
This	1
strange	1
stillness,	1
and	1
the	1
thoughts,	1
always	1
present	1
to	1
our	1
knight’s	1
mind,	1
of	1
the	1
incidents	1
described	1
at	1
every	1
turn	1
in	1
the	1
books	1
that	1
were	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
his	1
misfortune,	1
conjured	1
up	1
to	1
his	1
imagination	1
as	1
extraordinary	1
a	1
delusion	1
as	1
can	1
well	1
be	1
conceived,	1
which	1
was	1
that	1
he	1
fancied	1
himself	1
to	1
have	1
reached	1
a	1
famous	1
castle	1
(for,	1
as	1
has	1
been	1
said,	1
all	1
the	1
inns	1
he	1
lodged	1
in	1
were	1
castles	1
to	1
his	1
eyes),	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
the	1
innkeeper	1
was	1
daughter	1
of	1
the	1
lord	1
of	1
the	1
castle,	1
and	1
that	1
she,	1
won	1
by	1
his	1
high-bred	1
bearing,	1
had	1
fallen	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
him,	1
and	1
had	1
promised	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
his	1
bed	1
for	1
a	1
while	1
that	1
night	1
without	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
her	1
parents;	1
and	1
holding	1
all	1
this	1
fantasy	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
constructed	1
as	1
solid	1
fact,	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
feel	1
uneasy	1
and	1
to	1
consider	1
the	1
perilous	1
risk	1
which	1
his	1
virtue	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
encounter,	1
and	1
he	1
resolved	1
in	1
his	1
heart	1
to	1
commit	1
no	1
treason	1
to	1
his	1
lady	1
Dulcinea	1
del	1
Toboso,	1
even	1
though	1
the	1
queen	1
Guinevere	1
herself	1
and	1
the	1
dame	1
Quintañona	1
should	1
present	1
themselves	1
before	1
him.	1
While	1
he	1
was	1
taken	1
up	1
with	1
these	1
vagaries,	1
then,	1
the	1
time	1
and	1
the	1
hour—an	1
unlucky	1
one	1
for	1
him—arrived	1
for	1
the	1
Asturian	1
to	1
come,	1
who	1
in	1
her	1
smock,	1
with	1
bare	1
feet	1
and	1
her	1
hair	1
gathered	1
into	1
a	1
fustian	1
coif,	1
with	1
noiseless	1
and	1
cautious	1
steps	1
entered	1
the	1
chamber	1
where	1
the	1
three	1
were	1
quartered,	1
in	1
quest	1
of	1
the	1
carrier;	1
but	1
scarcely	1
had	1
she	1
gained	1
the	1
door	1
when	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
perceived	1
her,	1
and	1
sitting	1
up	1
in	1
his	1
bed	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
his	1
plasters	1
and	1
the	1
pain	1
of	1
his	1
ribs,	1
he	1
stretched	1
out	1
his	1
arms	1
to	1
receive	1
his	1
beauteous	1
damsel.	1
The	1
Asturian,	1
who	1
went	1
all	1
doubled	1
up	1
and	1
in	1
silence	1
with	1
her	1
hands	1
before	1
her	1
feeling	1
for	1
her	1
lover,	1
encountered	1
the	1
arms	1
of	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
who	1
grasped	1
her	1
tightly	1
by	1
the	1
wrist,	1
and	1
drawing	1
her	1
towards	1
him,	1
while	1
she	1
dared	1
not	1
utter	1
a	1
word,	1
made	1
her	1
sit	1
down	1
on	1
the	1
bed.	1
He	1
then	1
felt	1
her	1
smock,	1
and	1
although	1
it	1
was	1
of	1
sackcloth	1
it	1
appeared	1
to	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
of	1
the	1
finest	1
and	1
softest	1
silk:	1
on	1
her	1
wrists	1
she	1
wore	1
some	1
glass	1
beads,	1
but	1
to	1
him	1
they	1
had	1
the	1
sheen	1
of	1
precious	1
Orient	1
pearls:	1
her	1
hair,	1
which	1
in	1
some	1
measure	1
resembled	1
a	1
horse’s	1
mane,	1
he	1
rated	1
as	1
threads	1
of	1
the	1
brightest	1
gold	1
of	1
Araby,	1
whose	1
refulgence	1
dimmed	1
the	1
sun	1
himself:	1
her	1
breath,	1
which	1
no	1
doubt	1
smelt	1
of	1
yesterday’s	1
stale	1
salad,	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
to	1
diffuse	1
a	1
sweet	1
aromatic	1
fragrance	1
from	1
her	1
mouth;	1
and,	1
in	1
short,	1
he	1
drew	1
her	1
portrait	1
in	1
his	1
imagination	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
features	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
style	1
as	1
that	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
seen	1
in	1
his	1
books	1
of	1
the	1
other	1
princesses	1
who,	1
smitten	1
by	1
love,	1
came	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
adornments	1
that	1
are	1
here	1
set	1
down,	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
sorely	1
wounded	1
knight;	1
and	1
so	1
great	1
was	1
the	1
poor	1
gentleman’s	1
blindness	1
that	1
neither	1
touch,	1
nor	1
smell,	1
nor	1
anything	1
else	1
about	1
the	1
good	1
lass	1
that	1
would	1
have	1
made	1
any	1
but	1
a	1
carrier	1
vomit,	1
were	1
enough	1
to	1
undeceive	1
him;	1
on	1
the	1
contrary,	1
he	1
was	1
persuaded	1
he	1
had	1
the	1
goddess	1
of	1
beauty	1
in	1
his	1
arms,	1
and	1
holding	1
her	1
firmly	1
in	1
his	1
grasp	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
to	1
say	1
in	1
low,	1
tender	1
voice:	1
“Would	1
that	1
found	1
myself,	1
lovely	1
and	1
exalted	1
lady,	1
in	1
a	1
position	1
to	1
repay	1
such	1
a	1
favour	1
as	1
that	1
which	1
you,	1
by	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
your	1
great	1
beauty,	1
have	1
granted	1
me;	1
but	1
fortune,	1
which	1
is	1
never	1
weary	1
of	1
persecuting	1
the	1
good,	1
has	1
chosen	1
to	1
place	1
me	1
upon	1
this	1
bed,	1
where	1
I	1
lie	1
so	1
bruised	1
and	1
broken	1
that	1
though	1
my	1
inclination	1
would	1
gladly	1
comply	1
with	1
yours	1
it	1
is	1
impossible;	1
besides,	1
to	1
this	1
impossibility	1
another	1
yet	1
greater	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
added,	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
faith	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
pledged	1
to	1
the	1
peerless	1
Dulcinea	1
del	1
Toboso,	1
sole	1
lady	1
of	1
my	1
most	1
secret	1
thoughts;	1
and	1
were	1
it	1
not	1
that	1
this	1
stood	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
I	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
so	1
insensible	1
a	1
knight	1
as	1
to	1
miss	1
the	1
happy	1
opportunity	1
which	1
your	1
great	1
goodness	1
has	1
offered	1
me.”	1
Maritornes	1
was	1
fretting	1
and	1
sweating	1
at	1
finding	1
herself	1
held	1
so	1
fast	1
by	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
and	1
not	1
understanding	1
or	1
heeding	1
the	1
words	1
he	1
addressed	1
to	1
her,	1
she	1
strove	1
without	1
speaking	1
to	1
free	1
herself.	1
The	1
worthy	1
carrier,	1
whose	1
unholy	1
thoughts	1
kept	1
him	1
awake,	1
was	1
aware	1
of	1
his	1
doxy	1
the	1
moment	1
she	1
entered	1
the	1
door,	1
and	1
was	1
listening	1
attentively	1
to	1
all	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
said;	1
and	1
jealous	1
that	1
the	1
Asturian	1
should	1
have	1
broken	1
her	1
word	1
with	1
him	1
for	1
another,	1
drew	1
nearer	1
to	1
Don	1
Quixote’s	1
bed	1
and	1
stood	1
still	1
to	1
see	1
what	1
would	1
come	1
of	1
this	1
talk	1
which	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
understand;	1
but	1
when	1
he	1
perceived	1
the	1
wench	1
struggling	1
to	1
get	1
free	1
and	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
striving	1
to	1
hold	1
her,	1
not	1
relishing	1
the	1
joke	1
he	1
raised	1
his	1
arm	1
and	1
delivered	1
such	1
a	1
terrible	1
cuff	1
on	1
the	1
lank	1
jaws	1
of	1
the	1
amorous	1
knight	1
that	1
he	1
bathed	1
all	1
his	1
mouth	1
in	1
blood,	1
and	1
not	1
content	1
with	1
this	1
he	1
mounted	1
on	1
his	1
ribs	1
and	1
with	1
his	1
feet	1
tramped	1
all	1
over	1
them	1
at	1
a	1
pace	1
rather	1
smarter	1
than	1
a	1
trot.	1
The	1
bed	1
which	1
was	1
somewhat	1
crazy	1
and	1
not	1
very	1
firm	1
on	1
its	1
feet,	1
unable	1
to	1
support	1
the	1
additional	1
weight	1
of	1
the	1
carrier,	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
ground,	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
mighty	1
crash	1
of	1
this	1
the	1
innkeeper	1
awoke	1
and	1
at	1
once	1
concluded	1
that	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
some	1
brawl	1
of	1
Maritornes’,	1
because	1
after	1
calling	1
loudly	1
to	1
her	1
he	1
got	1
no	1
answer.	1
With	1
this	1
suspicion	1
he	1
got	1
up,	1
and	1
lighting	1
a	1
lamp	1
hastened	1
to	1
the	1
quarter	1
where	1
he	1
had	1
heard	1
the	1
disturbance.	1
The	1
wench,	1
seeing	1
that	1
her	1
master	1
was	1
coming	1
and	1
knowing	1
that	1
his	1
temper	1
was	1
terrible,	1
frightened	1
and	1
panic-stricken	1
made	1
for	1
the	1
bed	1
of	1
Sancho	1
Panza,	1
who	1
still	1
slept,	1
and	1
crouching	1
upon	1
it	1
made	1
a	1
ball	1
of	1
herself.	1
The	1
innkeeper	1
came	1
in	1
exclaiming,	1
“Where	1
art	1
thou,	1
strumpet?	1
Of	1
course	1
this	1
is	1
some	1
of	1
thy	1
work.”	1
At	1
this	1
Sancho	1
awoke,	1
and	1
feeling	1
this	1
mass	1
almost	1
on	1
top	1
of	1
him	1
fancied	1
he	1
had	1
the	1
nightmare	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
distribute	1
fisticuffs	1
all	1
round,	1
of	1
which	1
a	1
certain	1
share	1
fell	1
upon	1
Maritornes,	1
who,	1
irritated	1
by	1
the	1
pain	1
and	1
flinging	1
modesty	1
aside,	1
paid	1
back	1
so	1
many	1
in	1
return	1
to	1
Sancho	1
that	1
she	1
woke	1
him	1
up	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
himself.	1
He	1
then,	1
finding	1
himself	1
so	1
handled,	1
by	1
whom	1
he	1
knew	1
not,	1
raising	1
himself	1
up	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
he	1
could,	1
grappled	1
with	1
Maritornes,	1
and	1
he	1
and	1
she	1
between	1
them	1
began	1
the	1
bitterest	1
and	1
drollest	1
scrimmage	1
in	1
the	1
world.	1
The	1
carrier,	1
however,	1
perceiving	1
by	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
the	1
innkeeper	1
candle	1
how	1
it	1
fared	1
with	1
his	1
ladylove,	1
quitting	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
ran	1
to	1
bring	1
her	1
the	1
help	1
she	1
needed;	1
and	1
the	1
innkeeper	1
did	1
the	1
same	1
but	1
with	1
a	1
different	1
intention,	1
for	1
his	1
was	1
to	1
chastise	1
the	1
lass,	1
as	1
he	1
believed	1
that	1
beyond	1
a	1
doubt	1
she	1
alone	1
was	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
harmony.	1
And	1
so,	1
as	1
the	1
saying	1
is,	1
cat	1
to	1
rat,	1
rat	1
to	1
rope,	1
rope	1
to	1
stick,	1
the	1
carrier	1
pounded	1
Sancho,	1
Sancho	1
the	1
lass,	1
she	1
him,	1
and	1
the	1
innkeeper	1
her,	1
and	1
all	1
worked	1
away	1
so	1
briskly	1
that	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
give	1
themselves	1
a	1
moment’s	1
rest;	1
and	1
the	1
best	1
of	1
it	1
was	1
that	1
the	1
innkeeper’s	1
lamp	1
went	1
out,	1
and	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
left	1
in	1
the	1
dark	1
they	1
all	1
laid	1
on	1
one	1
upon	1
the	1
other	1
in	1
a	1
mass	1
so	1
unmercifully	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
sound	1
spot	1
left	1
where	1
a	1
hand	1
could	1
light.	1
It	1
so	1
happened	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
lodging	1
that	1
night	1
in	1
the	1
inn	1
a	1
caudrillero	1
of	1
what	1
they	1
call	1
the	1
Old	1
Holy	1
Brotherhood	1
of	1
Toledo,	1
who,	1
also	1
hearing	1
the	1
extraordinary	1
noise	1
of	1
the	1
conflict,	1
seized	1
his	1
staff	1
and	1
the	1
tin	1
case	1
with	1
his	1
warrants,	1
and	1
made	1
his	1
way	1
in	1
the	1
dark	1
into	1
the	1
room	1
crying:	1
“Hold!	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
Jurisdiction!	1
Hold!	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
Holy	1
Brotherhood!”	1
The	1
first	1
that	1
he	1
came	1
upon	1
was	1
the	1
pummelled	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
who	1
lay	1
stretched	1
senseless	1
on	1
his	1
back	1
upon	1
his	1
broken-down	1
bed,	1
and,	1
his	1
hand	1
falling	1
on	1
the	1
beard	1
as	1
he	1
felt	1
about,	1
he	1
continued	1
to	1
cry,	1
“Help	1
for	1
the	1
Jurisdiction!”	1
but	1
perceiving	1
that	1
he	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
laid	1
hold	1
of	1
did	1
not	1
move	1
or	1
stir,	1
he	1
concluded	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
dead	1
and	1
that	1
those	1
in	1
the	1
room	1
were	1
his	1
murderers,	1
and	1
with	1
this	1
suspicion	1
he	1
raised	1
his	1
voice	1
still	1
higher,	1
calling	1
out,	1
“Shut	1
the	1
inn	1
gate;	1
see	1
that	1
no	1
one	1
goes	1
out;	1
they	1
have	1
killed	1
a	1
man	1
here!”	1
This	1
cry	1
startled	1
them	1
all,	1
and	1
each	1
dropped	1
the	1
contest	1
at	1
the	1
point	1
at	1
which	1
the	1
voice	1
reached	1
him.	1
The	1
innkeeper	1
retreated	1
to	1
his	1
room,	1
the	1
carrier	1
to	1
his	1
pack-saddles,	1
the	1
lass	1
to	1
her	1
crib;	1
the	1
unlucky	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
and	1
Sancho	1
alone	1
were	1
unable	1
to	1
move	1
from	1
where	1
they	1
were.	1
The	1
cuadrillero	1
on	1
this	1
let	1
go	1
Don	1
Quixote’s	1
beard,	1
and	1
went	1
out	1
to	1
look	1
for	1
a	1
light	1
to	1
search	1
for	1
and	1
apprehend	1
the	1
culprits;	1
but	1
not	1
finding	1
one,	1
as	1
the	1
innkeeper	1
had	1
purposely	1
extinguished	1
the	1
lantern	1
on	1
retreating	1
to	1
his	1
room,	1
he	1
was	1
compelled	1
to	1
have	1
recourse	1
to	1
the	1
hearth,	1
where	1
after	1
much	1
time	1
and	1
trouble	1
he	1
lit	1
another	1
lamp.	1

By	1
this	1
time	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
had	1
recovered	1
from	1
his	1
swoon;	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
tone	1
of	1
voice	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
called	1
to	1
his	1
squire	1
the	1
day	1
before	1
when	1
he	1
lay	1
stretched	1
“in	1
the	1
vale	1
of	1
the	1
stakes,”	1
he	1
began	1
calling	1
to	1
him	1
now,	1
“Sancho,	1
my	1
friend,	1
art	1
thou	1
asleep?	1
sleepest	1
thou,	1
friend	1
Sancho?”	1
“How	1
can	1
I	1
sleep,	1
curses	1
on	1
it!”	1
returned	1
Sancho	1
discontentedly	1
and	1
bitterly,	1
“when	1
it	1
is	1
plain	1
that	1
all	1
the	1
devils	1
have	1
been	1
at	1
me	1
this	1
night?”	1
“Thou	1
mayest	1
well	1
believe	1
that,”	1
answered	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“because,	1
either	1
I	1
know	1
little,	1
or	1
this	1
castle	1
is	1
enchanted,	1
for	1
thou	1
must	1
know—but	1
this	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
now	1
about	1
to	1
tell	1
thee	1
thou	1
must	1
swear	1
to	1
keep	1
secret	1
until	1
after	1
my	1
death.”	1
“I	1
swear	1
it,”	1
answered	1
Sancho.	1
“I	1
say	1
so,”	1
continued	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“because	1
I	1
hate	1
taking	1
away	1
anyone’s	1
good	1
name.”	1
“I	1
say,”	1
replied	1
Sancho,	1
“that	1
I	1
swear	1
to	1
hold	1
my	1
tongue	1
about	1
it	1
till	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
your	1
worship’s	1
days,	1
and	1
God	1
grant	1
I	1
may	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
let	1
it	1
out	1
to-morrow.”	1
“Do	1
I	1
do	1
thee	1
such	1
injuries,	1
Sancho,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“that	1
thou	1
wouldst	1
see	1
me	1
dead	1
so	1
soon?”	1
“It	1
is	1
not	1
for	1
that,”	1
replied	1
Sancho,	1
“but	1
because	1
I	1
hate	1
keeping	1
things	1
long,	1
and	1
I	1
don’t	1
want	1
them	1
to	1
grow	1
rotten	1
with	1
me	1
from	1
over-keeping.”	1
“At	1
any	1
rate,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“I	1
have	1
more	1
confidence	1
in	1
thy	1
affection	1
and	1
good	1
nature;	1
and	1
so	1
I	1
would	1
have	1
thee	1
know	1
that	1
this	1
night	1
there	1
befell	1
me	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
strangest	1
adventures	1
that	1
I	1
could	1
describe,	1
and	1
to	1
relate	1
it	1
to	1
thee	1
briefly	1
thou	1
must	1
know	1
that	1
a	1
little	1
while	1
ago	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
the	1
lord	1
of	1
this	1
castle	1
came	1
to	1
me,	1
and	1
that	1
she	1
is	1
the	1
most	1
elegant	1
and	1
beautiful	1
damsel	1
that	1
could	1
be	1
found	1
in	1
the	1
wide	1
world.	1
What	1
I	1
could	1
tell	1
thee	1
of	1
the	1
charms	1
of	1
her	1
person!	1
of	1
her	1
lively	1
wit!	1
of	1
other	1
secret	1
matters	1
which,	1
to	1
preserve	1
the	1
fealty	1
I	1
owe	1
to	1
my	1
lady	1
Dulcinea	1
del	1
Toboso,	1
I	1
shall	1
pass	1
over	1
unnoticed	1
and	1
in	1
silence!	1
I	1
will	1
only	1
tell	1
thee	1
that,	1
either	1
fate	1
being	1
envious	1
of	1
so	1
great	1
a	1
boon	1
placed	1
in	1
my	1
hands	1
by	1
good	1
fortune,	1
or	1
perhaps	1
(and	1
this	1
is	1
more	1
probable)	1
this	1
castle	1
being,	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
already	1
said,	1
enchanted,	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
when	1
I	1
was	1
engaged	1
in	1
the	1
sweetest	1
and	1
most	1
amorous	1
discourse	1
with	1
her,	1
there	1
came,	1
without	1
my	1
seeing	1
or	1
knowing	1
whence	1
it	1
came,	1
a	1
hand	1
attached	1
to	1
some	1
arm	1
of	1
some	1
huge	1
giant,	1
that	1
planted	1
such	1
a	1
cuff	1
on	1
my	1
jaws	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
them	1
all	1
bathed	1
in	1
blood,	1
and	1
then	1
pummelled	1
me	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
way	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
in	1
a	1
worse	1
plight	1
than	1
yesterday	1
when	1
the	1
carriers,	1
on	1
account	1
of	1
Rocinante’s	1
misbehaviour,	1
inflicted	1
on	1
us	1
the	1
injury	1
thou	1
knowest	1
of;	1
whence	1
conjecture	1
that	1
there	1
must	1
be	1
some	1
enchanted	1
Moor	1
guarding	1
the	1
treasure	1
of	1
this	1
damsel’s	1
beauty,	1
and	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
for	1
me.”	1
“Not	1
for	1
me	1
either,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“for	1
more	1
than	1
four	1
hundred	1
Moors	1
have	1
so	1
thrashed	1
me	1
that	1
the	1
drubbing	1
of	1
the	1
stakes	1
was	1
cakes	1
and	1
fancy-bread	1
to	1
it.	1
But	1
tell	1
me,	1
señor,	1
what	1
do	1
you	1
call	1
this	1
excellent	1
and	1
rare	1
adventure	1
that	1
has	1
left	1
us	1
as	1
we	1
are	1
left	1
now?	1
Though	1
your	1
worship	1
was	1
not	1
so	1
badly	1
off,	1
having	1
in	1
your	1
arms	1
that	1
incomparable	1
beauty	1
you	1
spoke	1
of;	1
but	1
I,	1
what	1
did	1
I	1
have,	1
except	1
the	1
heaviest	1
whacks	1
I	1
think	1
I	1
had	1
in	1
all	1
my	1
life?	1
Unlucky	1
me	1
and	1
the	1
mother	1
that	1
bore	1
me!	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
a	1
knight-errant	1
and	1
never	1
expect	1
to	1
be	1
one,	1
and	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
mishaps,	1
the	1
greater	1
part	1
falls	1
to	1
my	1
share.”	1
“Then	1
thou	1
hast	1
been	1
thrashed	1
too?”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote.	1
“Didn’t	1
I	1
say	1
so?	1
worse	1
luck	1
to	1
my	1
line!”	1
said	1
Sancho.	1
“Be	1
not	1
distressed,	1
friend,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“for	1
I	1
will	1
now	1
make	1
the	1
precious	1
balsam	1
with	1
which	1
we	1
shall	1
cure	1
ourselves	1
in	1
the	1
twinkling	1
of	1
an	1
eye.”	1
By	1
this	1
time	1
the	1
cuadrillero	1
had	1
succeeded	1
in	1
lighting	1
the	1
lamp,	1
and	1
came	1
in	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
man	1
that	1
he	1
thought	1
had	1
been	1
killed;	1
and	1
as	1
Sancho	1
caught	1
sight	1
of	1
him	1
at	1
the	1
door,	1
seeing	1
him	1
coming	1
in	1
his	1
shirt,	1
with	1
a	1
cloth	1
on	1
his	1
head,	1
and	1
a	1
lamp	1
in	1
his	1
hand,	1
and	1
a	1
very	1
forbidding	1
countenance,	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
his	1
master,	1
“Señor,	1
can	1
it	1
be	1
that	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
enchanted	1
Moor	1
coming	1
back	1
to	1
give	1
us	1
more	1
castigation	1
if	1
there	1
be	1
anything	1
still	1
left	1
in	1
the	1
ink-bottle?”	1
“It	1
cannot	1
be	1
the	1
Moor,”	1
answered	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“for	1
those	1
under	1
enchantment	1
do	1
not	1
let	1
themselves	1
be	1
seen	1
by	1
anyone.”	1
“If	1
they	1
don’t	1
let	1
themselves	1
be	1
seen,	1
they	1
let	1
themselves	1
be	1
felt,”	1
said	1
Sancho;	1
“if	1
not,	1
let	1
my	1
shoulders	1
speak	1
to	1
the	1
point.”	1
“Mine	1
could	1
speak	1
too,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“but	1
that	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
sufficient	1
reason	1
for	1
believing	1
that	1
what	1
we	1
see	1
is	1
the	1
enchanted	1
Moor.”	1
The	1
officer	1
came	1
up,	1
and	1
finding	1
them	1
engaged	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
peaceful	1
conversation,	1
stood	1
amazed;	1
though	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
to	1
be	1
sure,	1
still	1
lay	1
on	1
his	1
back	1
unable	1
to	1
move	1
from	1
pure	1
pummelling	1
and	1
plasters.	1
The	1
officer	1
turned	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
said,	1
“Well,	1
how	1
goes	1
it,	1
good	1
man?”	1
“I	1
would	1
speak	1
more	1
politely	1
if	1
I	1
were	1
you,”	1
replied	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
“is	1
it	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
this	1
country	1
to	1
address	1
knights-errant	1
in	1
that	1
style,	1
you	1
booby?”	1
The	1
cuadrillero	1
finding	1
himself	1
so	1
disrespectfully	1
treated	1
by	1
such	1
a	1
sorry-looking	1
individual,	1
lost	1
his	1
temper,	1
and	1
raising	1
the	1
lamp	1
full	1
of	1
oil,	1
smote	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
such	1
a	1
blow	1
with	1
it	1
on	1
the	1
head	1
that	1
he	1
gave	1
him	1
a	1
badly	1
broken	1
pate;	1
then,	1
all	1
being	1
in	1
darkness,	1
he	1
went	1
out,	1
and	1
Sancho	1
Panza	1
said,	1
“That	1
is	1
certainly	1
the	1
enchanted	1
Moor,	1
Señor,	1
and	1
he	1
keeps	1
the	1
treasure	1
for	1
others,	1
and	1
for	1
us	1
only	1
the	1
cuffs	1
and	1
lamp-whacks.”	1
“That	1
is	1
the	1
truth,”	1
answered	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“and	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
use	1
in	1
troubling	1
oneself	1
about	1
these	1
matters	1
of	1
enchantment	1
or	1
being	1
angry	1
or	1
vexed	1
at	1
them,	1
for	1
as	1
they	1
are	1
invisible	1
and	1
visionary	1
we	1
shall	1
find	1
no	1
one	1
on	1
whom	1
to	1
avenge	1
ourselves,	1
do	1
what	1
we	1
may;	1
rise,	1
Sancho,	1
if	1
thou	1
canst,	1
and	1
call	1
the	1
alcaide	1
of	1
this	1
fortress,	1
and	1
get	1
him	1
to	1
give	1
me	1
a	1
little	1
oil,	1
wine,	1
salt,	1
and	1
rosemary	1
to	1
make	1
the	1
salutiferous	1
balsam,	1
for	1
indeed	1
I	1
believe	1
I	1
have	1
great	1
need	1
of	1
it	1
now,	1
because	1
I	1
am	1
losing	1
much	1
blood	1
from	1
the	1
wound	1
that	1
phantom	1
gave	1
me.”	1
Sancho	1
got	1
up	1
with	1
pain	1
enough	1
in	1
his	1
bones,	1
and	1
went	1
after	1
the	1
innkeeper	1
in	1
the	1
dark,	1
and	1
meeting	1
the	1
officer,	1
who	1
was	1
looking	1
to	1
see	1
what	1
had	1
become	1
of	1
his	1
enemy,	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
him,	1
“Señor,	1
whoever	1
you	1
are,	1
do	1
us	1
the	1
favour	1
and	1
kindness	1
to	1
give	1
us	1
a	1
little	1
rosemary,	1
oil,	1
salt,	1
and	1
wine,	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
wanted	1
to	1
cure	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
best	1
knights-errant	1
on	1
earth,	1
who	1
lies	1
on	1
yonder	1
bed	1
wounded	1
by	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
the	1
enchanted	1
Moor	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
this	1
inn.”	1
When	1
the	1
officer	1
heard	1
him	1
talk	1
in	1
this	1
way,	1
he	1
took	1
him	1
for	1
a	1
man	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
senses,	1
and	1
as	1
day	1
was	1
now	1
beginning	1
to	1
break,	1
he	1
opened	1
the	1
inn	1
gate,	1
and	1
calling	1
the	1
host,	1
he	1
told	1
him	1
what	1
this	1
good	1
man	1
wanted.	1
The	1
host	1
furnished	1
him	1
with	1
what	1
he	1
required,	1
and	1
Sancho	1
brought	1
it	1
to	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
who,	1
with	1
his	1
hand	1
to	1
his	1
head,	1
was	1
bewailing	1
the	1
pain	1
of	1
the	1
blow	1
of	1
the	1
lamp,	1
which	1
had	1
done	1
him	1
no	1
more	1
harm	1
than	1
raising	1
a	1
couple	1
of	1
rather	1
large	1
lumps,	1
and	1
what	1
he	1
fancied	1
blood	1
was	1
only	1
the	1
sweat	1
that	1
flowed	1
from	1
him	1
in	1
his	1
sufferings	1
during	1
the	1
late	1
storm.	1
To	1
be	1
brief,	1
he	1
took	1
the	1
materials,	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
made	1
a	1
compound,	1
mixing	1
them	1
all	1
and	1
boiling	1
them	1
a	1
good	1
while	1
until	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
they	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
perfection.	1
He	1
then	1
asked	1
for	1
some	1
vial	1
to	1
pour	1
it	1
into,	1
and	1
as	1
there	1
was	1
not	1
one	1
in	1
the	1
inn,	1
he	1
decided	1
on	1
putting	1
it	1
into	1
a	1
tin	1
oil-bottle	1
or	1
flask	1
of	1
which	1
the	1
host	1
made	1
him	1
a	1
free	1
gift;	1
and	1
over	1
the	1
flask	1
he	1
repeated	1
more	1
than	1
eighty	1
paternosters	1
and	1
as	1
many	1
more	1
ave-marias,	1
salves,	1
and	1
credos,	1
accompanying	1
each	1
word	1
with	1
a	1
cross	1
by	1
way	1
of	1
benediction,	1
at	1
all	1
which	1
there	1
were	1
present	1
Sancho,	1
the	1
innkeeper,	1
and	1
the	1
cuadrillero;	1
for	1
the	1
carrier	1
was	1
now	1
peacefully	1
engaged	1
in	1
attending	1
to	1
the	1
comfort	1
of	1
his	1
mules.	1
This	1
being	1
accomplished,	1
he	1
felt	1
anxious	1
to	1
make	1
trial	1
himself,	1
on	1
the	1
spot,	1
of	1
the	1
virtue	1
of	1
this	1
precious	1
balsam,	1
as	1
he	1
considered	1
it,	1
and	1
so	1
he	1
drank	1
near	1
a	1
quart	1
of	1
what	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
put	1
into	1
the	1
flask	1
and	1
remained	1
in	1
the	1
pigskin	1
in	1
which	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
boiled;	1
but	1
scarcely	1
had	1
he	1
done	1
drinking	1
when	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
vomit	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
way	1
that	1
nothing	1
was	1
left	1
in	1
his	1
stomach,	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
pangs	1
and	1
spasms	1
of	1
vomiting	1
he	1
broke	1
into	1
a	1
profuse	1
sweat,	1
on	1
account	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
bade	1
them	1
cover	1
him	1
up	1
and	1
leave	1
him	1
alone.	1
They	1
did	1
so,	1
and	1
he	1
lay	1
sleeping	1
more	1
than	1
three	1
hours,	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
awoke	1
and	1
felt	1
very	1
great	1
bodily	1
relief	1
and	1
so	1
much	1
ease	1
from	1
his	1
bruises	1
that	1
he	1
thought	1
himself	1
quite	1
cured,	1
and	1
verily	1
believed	1
he	1
had	1
hit	1
upon	1
the	1
balsam	1
of	1
Fierabras;	1
and	1
that	1
with	1
this	1
remedy	1
he	1
might	1
thenceforward,	1
without	1
any	1
fear,	1
face	1
any	1
kind	1
of	1
destruction,	1
battle,	1
or	1
combat,	1
however	1
perilous	1
it	1
might	1
be.	1
Sancho	1
Panza,	1
who	1
also	1
regarded	1
the	1
amendment	1
of	1
his	1
master	1
as	1
miraculous,	1
begged	1
him	1
to	1
give	1
him	1
what	1
was	1
left	1
in	1
the	1
pigskin,	1
which	1
was	1
no	1
small	1
quantity.	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
consented,	1
and	1
he,	1
taking	1
it	1
with	1
both	1
hands,	1
in	1
good	1
faith	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
better	1
will,	1
gulped	1
down	1
and	1
drained	1
off	1
very	1
little	1
less	1
than	1
his	1
master.	1
But	1
the	1
fact	1
is,	1
that	1
the	1
stomach	1
of	1
poor	1
Sancho	1
was	1
of	1
necessity	1
not	1
so	1
delicate	1
as	1
that	1
of	1
his	1
master,	1
and	1
so,	1
before	1
vomiting,	1
he	1
was	1
seized	1
with	1
such	1
gripings	1
and	1
retchings,	1
and	1
such	1
sweats	1
and	1
faintness,	1
that	1
verily	1
and	1
truly	1
he	1
believed	1
his	1
last	1
hour	1
had	1
come,	1
and	1
finding	1
himself	1
so	1
racked	1
and	1
tormented	1
he	1
cursed	1
the	1
balsam	1
and	1
the	1
thief	1
that	1
had	1
given	1
it	1
to	1
him.	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
seeing	1
him	1
in	1
this	1
state	1
said,	1
“It	1
is	1
my	1
belief,	1
Sancho,	1
that	1
this	1
mischief	1
comes	1
of	1
thy	1
not	1
being	1
dubbed	1
a	1
knight,	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
persuaded	1
this	1
liquor	1
cannot	1
be	1
good	1
for	1
those	1
who	1
are	1
not	1
so.”	1
“If	1
your	1
worship	1
knew	1
that,”	1
returned	1
Sancho—“woe	1
betide	1
me	1
and	1
all	1
my	1
kindred!—why	1
did	1
you	1
let	1
me	1
taste	1
it?”	1
At	1
this	1
moment	1
the	1
draught	1
took	1
effect,	1
and	1
the	1
poor	1
squire	1
began	1
to	1
discharge	1
both	1
ways	1
at	1
such	1
a	1
rate	1
that	1
the	1
rush	1
mat	1
on	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
thrown	1
himself	1
and	1
the	1
canvas	1
blanket	1
he	1
had	1
covering	1
him	1
were	1
fit	1
for	1
nothing	1
afterwards.	1
He	1
sweated	1
and	1
perspired	1
with	1
such	1
paroxysms	1
and	1
convulsions	1
that	1
not	1
only	1
he	1
himself	1
but	1
all	1
present	1
thought	1
his	1
end	1
had	1
come.	1
This	1
tempest	1
and	1
tribulation	1
lasted	1
about	1
two	1
hours,	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
left,	1
not	1
like	1
his	1
master,	1
but	1
so	1
weak	1
and	1
exhausted	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
stand.	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
however,	1
who,	1
as	1
has	1
been	1
said,	1
felt	1
himself	1
relieved	1
and	1
well,	1
was	1
eager	1
to	1
take	1
his	1
departure	1
at	1
once	1
in	1
quest	1
of	1
adventures,	1
as	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
all	1
the	1
time	1
he	1
loitered	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
fraud	1
upon	1
the	1
world	1
and	1
those	1
in	1
it	1
who	1
stood	1
in	1
need	1
of	1
his	1
help	1
and	1
protection,	1
all	1
the	1
more	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
the	1
security	1
and	1
confidence	1
his	1
balsam	1
afforded	1
him;	1
and	1
so,	1
urged	1
by	1
this	1
impulse,	1
he	1
saddled	1
Rocinante	1
himself	1
and	1
put	1
the	1
pack-saddle	1
on	1
his	1
squire’s	1
beast,	1
whom	1
likewise	1
he	1
helped	1
to	1
dress	1
and	1
mount	1
the	1
ass;	1
after	1
which	1
he	1
mounted	1
his	1
horse	1
and	1
turning	1
to	1
a	1
corner	1
of	1
the	1
inn	1
he	1
laid	1
hold	1
of	1
a	1
pike	1
that	1
stood	1
there,	1
to	1
serve	1
him	1
by	1
way	1
of	1
a	1
lance.	1
All	1
that	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
inn,	1
who	1
were	1
more	1
than	1
twenty	1
persons,	1
stood	1
watching	1
him;	1
the	1
innkeeper’s	1
daughter	1
was	1
likewise	1
observing	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
too	1
never	1
took	1
his	1
eyes	1
off	1
her,	1
and	1
from	1
time	1
to	1
time	1
fetched	1
a	1
sigh	1
that	1
he	1
seemed	1
to	1
pluck	1
up	1
from	1
the	1
depths	1
of	1
his	1
bowels;	1
but	1
they	1
all	1
thought	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
from	1
the	1
pain	1
he	1
felt	1
in	1
his	1
ribs;	1
at	1
any	1
rate	1
they	1
who	1
had	1
seen	1
him	1
plastered	1
the	1
night	1
before	1
thought	1
so.	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
both	1
mounted,	1
at	1
the	1
gate	1
of	1
the	1
inn,	1
he	1
called	1
to	1
the	1
host	1
and	1
said	1
in	1
a	1
very	1
grave	1
and	1
measured	1
voice,	1
“Many	1
and	1
great	1
are	1
the	1
favours,	1
Señor	1
Alcaide,	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
received	1
in	1
this	1
castle	1
of	1
yours,	1
and	1
I	1
remain	1
under	1
the	1
deepest	1
obligation	1
to	1
be	1
grateful	1
to	1
you	1
for	1
them	1
all	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
my	1
life;	1
if	1
I	1
can	1
repay	1
them	1
in	1
avenging	1
you	1
of	1
any	1
arrogant	1
foe	1
who	1
may	1
have	1
wronged	1
you,	1
know	1
that	1
my	1
calling	1
is	1
no	1
other	1
than	1
to	1
aid	1
the	1
weak,	1
to	1
avenge	1
those	1
who	1
suffer	1
wrong,	1
and	1
to	1
chastise	1
perfidy.	1
Search	1
your	1
memory,	1
and	1
if	1
you	1
find	1
anything	1
of	1
this	1
kind	1
you	1
need	1
only	1
tell	1
me	1
of	1
it,	1
and	1
I	1
promise	1
you	1
by	1
the	1
order	1
of	1
knighthood	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
received	1
to	1
procure	1
you	1
satisfaction	1
and	1
reparation	1
to	1
the	1
utmost	1
of	1
your	1
desire.”	1
The	1
innkeeper	1
replied	1
to	1
him	1
with	1
equal	1
calmness,	1
“Sir	1
Knight,	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
want	1
your	1
worship	1
to	1
avenge	1
me	1
of	1
any	1
wrong,	1
because	1
when	1
any	1
is	1
done	1
me	1
I	1
can	1
take	1
what	1
vengeance	1
seems	1
good	1
to	1
me;	1
the	1
only	1
thing	1
I	1
want	1
is	1
that	1
you	1
pay	1
me	1
the	1
score	1
that	1
you	1
have	1
run	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
inn	1
last	1
night,	1
as	1
well	1
for	1
the	1
straw	1
and	1
barley	1
for	1
your	1
two	1
beasts,	1
as	1
for	1
supper	1
and	1
beds.”	1

“Then	1
this	1
is	1
an	1
inn?”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote.	1
“And	1
a	1
very	1
respectable	1
one,”	1
said	1
the	1
innkeeper.	1
“I	1
have	1
been	1
under	1
a	1
mistake	1
all	1
this	1
time,”	1
answered	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“for	1
in	1
truth	1
I	1
thought	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
castle,	1
and	1
not	1
a	1
bad	1
one;	1
but	1
since	1
it	1
appears	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
castle	1
but	1
an	1
inn,	1
all	1
that	1
can	1
be	1
done	1
now	1
is	1
that	1
you	1
should	1
excuse	1
the	1
payment,	1
for	1
I	1
cannot	1
contravene	1
the	1
rule	1
of	1
knights-errant,	1
of	1
whom	1
I	1
know	1
as	1
a	1
fact	1
(and	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
present	1
I	1
have	1
read	1
nothing	1
to	1
the	1
contrary)	1
that	1
they	1
never	1
paid	1
for	1
lodging	1
or	1
anything	1
else	1
in	1
the	1
inn	1
where	1
they	1
might	1
be;	1
for	1
any	1
hospitality	1
that	1
might	1
be	1
offered	1
them	1
is	1
their	1
due	1
by	1
law	1
and	1
right	1
in	1
return	1
for	1
the	1
insufferable	1
toil	1
they	1
endure	1
in	1
seeking	1
adventures	1
by	1
night	1
and	1
by	1
day,	1
in	1
summer	1
and	1
in	1
winter,	1
on	1
foot	1
and	1
on	1
horseback,	1
in	1
hunger	1
and	1
thirst,	1
cold	1
and	1
heat,	1
exposed	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
inclemencies	1
of	1
heaven	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
hardships	1
of	1
earth.”	1
“I	1
have	1
little	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
that,”	1
replied	1
the	1
innkeeper;	1
“pay	1
me	1
what	1
you	1
owe	1
me,	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
have	1
no	1
more	1
talk	1
of	1
chivalry,	1
for	1
all	1
I	1
care	1
about	1
is	1
to	1
get	1
my	1
money.”	1
“You	1
are	1
a	1
stupid,	1
scurvy	1
innkeeper,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
and	1
putting	1
spurs	1
to	1
Rocinante	1
and	1
bringing	1
his	1
pike	1
to	1
the	1
slope	1
he	1
rode	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
inn	1
before	1
anyone	1
could	1
stop	1
him,	1
and	1
pushed	1
on	1
some	1
distance	1
without	1
looking	1
to	1
see	1
if	1
his	1
squire	1
was	1
following	1
him.	1
The	1
innkeeper	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
him	1
go	1
without	1
paying	1
him	1
ran	1
to	1
get	1
payment	1
of	1
Sancho,	1
who	1
said	1
that	1
as	1
his	1
master	1
would	1
not	1
pay	1
neither	1
would	1
he,	1
because,	1
being	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
squire	1
to	1
a	1
knight-errant,	1
the	1
same	1
rule	1
and	1
reason	1
held	1
good	1
for	1
him	1
as	1
for	1
his	1
master	1
with	1
regard	1
to	1
not	1
paying	1
anything	1
in	1
inns	1
and	1
hostelries.	1
At	1
this	1
the	1
innkeeper	1
waxed	1
very	1
wroth,	1
and	1
threatened	1
if	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
pay	1
to	1
compel	1
him	1
in	1
a	1
way	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
like.	1
To	1
which	1
Sancho	1
made	1
answer	1
that	1
by	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
chivalry	1
his	1
master	1
had	1
received	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
pay	1
a	1
rap,	1
though	1
it	1
cost	1
him	1
his	1
life;	1
for	1
the	1
excellent	1
and	1
ancient	1
usage	1
of	1
knights-errant	1
was	1
not	1
going	1
to	1
be	1
violated	1
by	1
him,	1
nor	1
should	1
the	1
squires	1
of	1
such	1
as	1
were	1
yet	1
to	1
come	1
into	1
the	1
world	1
ever	1
complain	1
of	1
him	1
or	1
reproach	1
him	1
with	1
breaking	1
so	1
just	1
a	1
privilege.	1
The	1
ill-luck	1
of	1
the	1
unfortunate	1
Sancho	1
so	1
ordered	1
it	1
that	1
among	1
the	1
company	1
in	1
the	1
inn	1
there	1
were	1
four	1
woolcarders	1
from	1
Segovia,	1
three	1
needle-makers	1
from	1
the	1
Colt	1
of	1
Cordova,	1
and	1
two	1
lodgers	1
from	1
the	1
Fair	1
of	1
Seville,	1
lively	1
fellows,	1
tender-hearted,	1
fond	1
of	1
a	1
joke,	1
and	1
playful,	1
who,	1
almost	1
as	1
if	1
instigated	1
and	1
moved	1
by	1
a	1
common	1
impulse,	1
made	1
up	1
to	1
Sancho	1
and	1
dismounted	1
him	1
from	1
his	1
ass,	1
while	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
went	1
in	1
for	1
the	1
blanket	1
of	1
the	1
host’s	1
bed;	1
but	1
on	1
flinging	1
him	1
into	1
it	1
they	1
looked	1
up,	1
and	1
seeing	1
that	1
the	1
ceiling	1
was	1
somewhat	1
lower	1
than	1
what	1
they	1
required	1
for	1
their	1
work,	1
they	1
decided	1
upon	1
going	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
yard,	1
which	1
was	1
bounded	1
by	1
the	1
sky,	1
and	1
there,	1
putting	1
Sancho	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
blanket,	1
they	1
began	1
to	1
raise	1
him	1
high,	1
making	1
sport	1
with	1
him	1
as	1
they	1
would	1
with	1
a	1
dog	1
at	1
Shrovetide.	1

The	1
cries	1
of	1
the	1
poor	1
blanketed	1
wretch	1
were	1
so	1
loud	1
that	1
they	1
reached	1
the	1
ears	1
of	1
his	1
master,	1
who,	1
halting	1
to	1
listen	1
attentively,	1
was	1
persuaded	1
that	1
some	1
new	1
adventure	1
was	1
coming,	1
until	1
he	1
clearly	1
perceived	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
his	1
squire	1
who	1
uttered	1
them.	1
Wheeling	1
about	1
he	1
came	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
inn	1
with	1
a	1
laborious	1
gallop,	1
and	1
finding	1
it	1
shut	1
went	1
round	1
it	1
to	1
see	1
if	1
he	1
could	1
find	1
some	1
way	1
of	1
getting	1
in;	1
but	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
wall	1
of	1
the	1
yard,	1
which	1
was	1
not	1
very	1
high,	1
he	1
discovered	1
the	1
game	1
that	1
was	1
being	1
played	1
with	1
his	1
squire.	1
He	1
saw	1
him	1
rising	1
and	1
falling	1
in	1
the	1
air	1
with	1
such	1
grace	1
and	1
nimbleness	1
that,	1
had	1
his	1
rage	1
allowed	1
him,	1
it	1
is	1
my	1
belief	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
laughed.	1
He	1
tried	1
to	1
climb	1
from	1
his	1
horse	1
on	1
to	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
wall,	1
but	1
he	1
was	1
so	1
bruised	1
and	1
battered	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
even	1
dismount;	1
and	1
so	1
from	1
the	1
back	1
of	1
his	1
horse	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
utter	1
such	1
maledictions	1
and	1
objurgations	1
against	1
those	1
who	1
were	1
blanketing	1
Sancho	1
as	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
impossible	1
to	1
write	1
down	1
accurately:	1
they,	1
however,	1
did	1
not	1
stay	1
their	1
laughter	1
or	1
their	1
work	1
for	1
this,	1
nor	1
did	1
the	1
flying	1
Sancho	1
cease	1
his	1
lamentations,	1
mingled	1
now	1
with	1
threats,	1
now	1
with	1
entreaties	1
but	1
all	1
to	1
little	1
purpose,	1
or	1
none	1
at	1
all,	1
until	1
from	1
pure	1
weariness	1
they	1
left	1
off.	1
They	1
then	1
brought	1
him	1
his	1
ass,	1
and	1
mounting	1
him	1
on	1
top	1
of	1
it	1
they	1
put	1
his	1
jacket	1
round	1
him;	1
and	1
the	1
compassionate	1
Maritornes,	1
seeing	1
him	1
so	1
exhausted,	1
thought	1
fit	1
to	1
refresh	1
him	1
with	1
a	1
jug	1
of	1
water,	1
and	1
that	1
it	1
might	1
be	1
all	1
the	1
cooler	1
she	1
fetched	1
it	1
from	1
the	1
well.	1
Sancho	1
took	1
it,	1
and	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
raising	1
it	1
to	1
his	1
mouth	1
he	1
was	1
stopped	1
by	1
the	1
cries	1
of	1
his	1
master	1
exclaiming,	1
“Sancho,	1
my	1
son,	1
drink	1
not	1
water;	1
drink	1
it	1
not,	1
my	1
son,	1
for	1
it	1
will	1
kill	1
thee;	1
see,	1
here	1
I	1
have	1
the	1
blessed	1
balsam	1
(and	1
he	1
held	1
up	1
the	1
flask	1
of	1
liquor),	1
and	1
with	1
drinking	1
two	1
drops	1
of	1
it	1
thou	1
wilt	1
certainly	1
be	1
restored.”	1
At	1
these	1
words	1
Sancho	1
turned	1
his	1
eyes	1
asquint,	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
still	1
louder	1
voice	1
said,	1
“Can	1
it	1
be	1
your	1
worship	1
has	1
forgotten	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
a	1
knight,	1
or	1
do	1
you	1
want	1
me	1
to	1
end	1
by	1
vomiting	1
up	1
what	1
bowels	1
I	1
have	1
left	1
after	1
last	1
night?	1
Keep	1
your	1
liquor	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
devils,	1
and	1
leave	1
me	1
to	1
myself!”	1
and	1
at	1
one	1
and	1
the	1
same	1
instant	1
he	1
left	1
off	1
talking	1
and	1
began	1
drinking;	1
but	1
as	1
at	1
the	1
first	1
sup	1
he	1
perceived	1
it	1
was	1
water	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
care	1
to	1
go	1
on	1
with	1
it,	1
and	1
begged	1
Maritornes	1
to	1
fetch	1
him	1
some	1
wine,	1
which	1
she	1
did	1
with	1
right	1
good	1
will,	1
and	1
paid	1
for	1
it	1
with	1
her	1
own	1
money;	1
for	1
indeed	1
they	1
say	1
of	1
her	1
that,	1
though	1
she	1
was	1
in	1
that	1
line	1
of	1
life,	1
there	1
was	1
some	1
faint	1
and	1
distant	1
resemblance	1
to	1
a	1
Christian	1
about	1
her.	1
When	1
Sancho	1
had	1
done	1
drinking	1
he	1
dug	1
his	1
heels	1
into	1
his	1
ass,	1
and	1
the	1
gate	1
of	1
the	1
inn	1
being	1
thrown	1
open	1
he	1
passed	1
out	1
very	1
well	1
pleased	1
at	1
having	1
paid	1
nothing	1
and	1
carried	1
his	1
point,	1
though	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
at	1
the	1
expense	1
of	1
his	1
usual	1
sureties,	1
his	1
shoulders.	1
It	1
is	1
true	1
that	1
the	1
innkeeper	1
detained	1
his	1
alforjas	1
in	1
payment	1
of	1
what	1
was	1
owing	1
to	1
him,	1
but	1
Sancho	1
took	1
his	1
departure	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
flurry	1
that	1
he	1
never	1
missed	1
them.	1
The	1
innkeeper,	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
saw	1
him	1
off,	1
wanted	1
to	1
bar	1
the	1
gate	1
close,	1
but	1
the	1
blanketers	1
would	1
not	1
agree	1
to	1
it,	1
for	1
they	1
were	1
fellows	1
who	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
cared	1
two	1
farthings	1
for	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
even	1
had	1
he	1
been	1
really	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
knights-errant	1
of	1
the	1

Sancho	1
reached	1
his	1
master	1
so	1
limp	1
and	1
faint	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
urge	1
on	1
his	1
beast.	1
When	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
saw	1
the	1
state	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
he	1
said,	1
“I	1
have	1
now	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
conclusion,	1
good	1
Sancho,	1
that	1
this	1
castle	1
or	1
inn	1
is	1
beyond	1
a	1
doubt	1
enchanted,	1
because	1
those	1
who	1
have	1
so	1
atrociously	1
diverted	1
themselves	1
with	1
thee,	1
what	1
can	1
they	1
be	1
but	1
phantoms	1
or	1
beings	1
of	1
another	1
world?	1
and	1
I	1
hold	1
this	1
confirmed	1
by	1
having	1
noticed	1
that	1
when	1
I	1
was	1
by	1
the	1
wall	1
of	1
the	1
yard	1
witnessing	1
the	1
acts	1
of	1
thy	1
sad	1
tragedy,	1
it	1
was	1
out	1
of	1
my	1
power	1
to	1
mount	1
upon	1
it,	1
nor	1
could	1
I	1
even	1
dismount	1
from	1
Rocinante,	1
because	1
they	1
no	1
doubt	1
had	1
me	1
enchanted;	1
for	1
I	1
swear	1
to	1
thee	1
by	1
the	1
faith	1
of	1
what	1
I	1
am	1
that	1
if	1
I	1
had	1
been	1
able	1
to	1
climb	1
up	1
or	1
dismount,	1
I	1
would	1
have	1
avenged	1
thee	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
way	1
that	1
those	1
braggart	1
thieves	1
would	1
have	1
remembered	1
their	1
freak	1
for	1
ever,	1
even	1
though	1
in	1
so	1
doing	1
I	1
knew	1
that	1
I	1
contravened	1
the	1
laws	1
of	1
chivalry,	1
which,	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
often	1
told	1
thee,	1
do	1
not	1
permit	1
a	1
knight	1
to	1
lay	1
hands	1
on	1
him	1
who	1
is	1
not	1
one,	1
save	1
in	1
case	1
of	1
urgent	1
and	1
great	1
necessity	1
in	1
defence	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
life	1
and	1
person.”	1
“I	1
would	1
have	1
avenged	1
myself	1
too	1
if	1
I	1
could,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“whether	1
I	1
had	1
been	1
dubbed	1
knight	1
or	1
not,	1
but	1
I	1
could	1
not;	1
though	1
for	1
my	1
part	1
I	1
am	1
persuaded	1
those	1
who	1
amused	1
themselves	1
with	1
me	1
were	1
not	1
phantoms	1
or	1
enchanted	1
men,	1
as	1
your	1
worship	1
says,	1
but	1
men	1
of	1
flesh	1
and	1
bone	1
like	1
ourselves;	1
and	1
they	1
all	1
had	1
their	1
names,	1
for	1
I	1
heard	1
them	1
name	1
them	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
tossing	1
me,	1
and	1
one	1
was	1
called	1
Pedro	1
Martinez,	1
and	1
another	1
Tenorio	1
Hernandez,	1
and	1
the	1
innkeeper,	1
I	1
heard,	1
was	1
called	1
Juan	1
Palomeque	1
the	1
Left-handed;	1
so	1
that,	1
señor,	1
your	1
not	1
being	1
able	1
to	1
leap	1
over	1
the	1
wall	1
of	1
the	1
yard	1
or	1
dismount	1
from	1
your	1
horse	1
came	1
of	1
something	1
else	1
besides	1
enchantments;	1
and	1
what	1
I	1
make	1
out	1
clearly	1
from	1
all	1
this	1
is,	1
that	1
these	1
adventures	1
we	1
go	1
seeking	1
will	1
in	1
the	1
end	1
lead	1
us	1
into	1
such	1
misadventures	1
that	1
we	1
shall	1
not	1
know	1
which	1
is	1
our	1
right	1
foot;	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
best	1
and	1
wisest	1
thing,	1
according	1
to	1
my	1
small	1
wits,	1
would	1
be	1
for	1
us	1
to	1
return	1
home,	1
now	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
harvest-time,	1
and	1
attend	1
to	1
our	1
business,	1
and	1
give	1
over	1
wandering	1
from	1
Zeca	1
to	1
Mecca	1
and	1
from	1
pail	1
to	1
bucket,	1
as	1
the	1
saying	1
is.”	1
“How	1
little	1
thou	1
knowest	1
about	1
chivalry,	1
Sancho,”	1
replied	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
“hold	1
thy	1
peace	1
and	1
have	1
patience;	1
the	1
day	1
will	1
come	1
when	1
thou	1
shalt	1
see	1
with	1
thine	1
own	1
eyes	1
what	1
an	1
honourable	1
thing	1
it	1
is	1
to	1
wander	1
in	1
the	1
pursuit	1
of	1
this	1
calling;	1
nay,	1
tell	1
me,	1
what	1
greater	1
pleasure	1
can	1
there	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
world,	1
or	1
what	1
delight	1
can	1
equal	1
that	1
of	1
winning	1
a	1
battle,	1
and	1
triumphing	1
over	1
one’s	1
enemy?	1
None,	1
beyond	1
all	1
doubt.”	1
“Very	1
likely,”	1
answered	1
Sancho,	1
“though	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
it;	1
all	1
I	1
know	1
is	1
that	1
since	1
we	1
have	1
been	1
knights-errant,	1
or	1
since	1
your	1
worship	1
has	1
been	1
one	1
(for	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
right	1
to	1
reckon	1
myself	1
one	1
of	1
so	1
honourable	1
a	1
number)	1
we	1
have	1
never	1
won	1
any	1
battle	1
except	1
the	1
one	1
with	1
the	1
Biscayan,	1
and	1
even	1
out	1
of	1
that	1
your	1
worship	1
came	1
with	1
half	1
an	1
ear	1
and	1
half	1
a	1
helmet	1
the	1
less;	1
and	1
from	1
that	1
till	1
now	1
it	1
has	1
been	1
all	1
cudgellings	1
and	1
more	1
cudgellings,	1
cuffs	1
and	1
more	1
cuffs,	1
I	1
getting	1
the	1
blanketing	1
over	1
and	1
above,	1
and	1
falling	1
in	1
with	1
enchanted	1
persons	1
on	1
whom	1
I	1
cannot	1
avenge	1
myself	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
know	1
what	1
the	1
delight,	1
as	1
your	1
worship	1
calls	1
it,	1
of	1
conquering	1
an	1
enemy	1
is	1
like.”	1
“That	1
is	1
what	1
vexes	1
me,	1
and	1
what	1
ought	1
to	1
vex	1
thee,	1
Sancho,”	1
replied	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
“but	1
henceforward	1
I	1
will	1
endeavour	1
to	1
have	1
at	1
hand	1
some	1
sword	1
made	1
by	1
such	1
craft	1
that	1
no	1
kind	1
of	1
enchantments	1
can	1
take	1
effect	1
upon	1
him	1
who	1
carries	1
it,	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
even	1
possible	1
that	1
fortune	1
may	1
procure	1
for	1
me	1
that	1
which	1
belonged	1
to	1
Amadis	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
called	1
‘The	1
Knight	1
of	1
the	1
Burning	1
Sword,’	1
which	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
best	1
swords	1
that	1
ever	1
knight	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
possessed,	1
for,	1
besides	1
having	1
the	1
said	1
virtue,	1
it	1
cut	1
like	1
a	1
razor,	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
armour,	1
however	1
strong	1
and	1
enchanted	1
it	1
might	1
be,	1
that	1
could	1
resist	1
it.”	1
“Such	1
is	1
my	1
luck,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“that	1
even	1
if	1
that	1
happened	1
and	1
your	1
worship	1
found	1
some	1
such	1
sword,	1
it	1
would,	1
like	1
the	1
balsam,	1
turn	1
out	1
serviceable	1
and	1
good	1
for	1
dubbed	1
knights	1
only,	1
and	1
as	1
for	1
the	1
squires,	1
they	1
might	1
sup	1
sorrow.”	1
“Fear	1
not	1
that,	1
Sancho,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote:	1
“Heaven	1
will	1
deal	1
better	1
by	1
thee.”	1
Thus	1
talking,	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
and	1
his	1
squire	1
were	1
going	1
along,	1
when,	1
on	1
the	1
road	1
they	1
were	1
following,	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
perceived	1
approaching	1
them	1
a	1
large	1
and	1
thick	1
cloud	1
of	1
dust,	1
on	1
seeing	1
which	1
he	1
turned	1
to	1
Sancho	1
and	1
said:	1
“This	1
is	1
the	1
day,	1
Sancho,	1
on	1
which	1
will	1
be	1
seen	1
the	1
boon	1
my	1
fortune	1
is	1
reserving	1
for	1
me;	1
this,	1
I	1
say,	1
is	1
the	1
day	1
on	1
which	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
on	1
any	1
other	1
shall	1
be	1
displayed	1
the	1
might	1
of	1
my	1
arm,	1
and	1
on	1
which	1
I	1
shall	1
do	1
deeds	1
that	1
shall	1
remain	1
written	1
in	1
the	1
book	1
of	1
fame	1
for	1
all	1
ages	1
to	1
come.	1
Seest	1
thou	1
that	1
cloud	1
of	1
dust	1
which	1
rises	1
yonder?	1
Well,	1
then,	1
all	1
that	1
is	1
churned	1
up	1
by	1
a	1
vast	1
army	1
composed	1
of	1
various	1
and	1
countless	1
nations	1
that	1
comes	1
marching	1
there.”	1
“According	1
to	1
that	1
there	1
must	1
be	1
two,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“for	1
on	1
this	1
opposite	1
side	1
also	1
there	1
rises	1
just	1
such	1
another	1
cloud	1
of	1
dust.”	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
turned	1
to	1
look	1
and	1
found	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
true,	1
and	1
rejoicing	1
exceedingly,	1
he	1
concluded	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
two	1
armies	1
about	1
to	1
engage	1
and	1
encounter	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
that	1
broad	1
plain;	1
for	1
at	1
all	1
times	1
and	1
seasons	1
his	1
fancy	1
was	1
full	1
of	1
the	1
battles,	1
enchantments,	1
adventures,	1
crazy	1
feats,	1
loves,	1
and	1
defiances	1
that	1
are	1
recorded	1
in	1
the	1
books	1
of	1
chivalry,	1
and	1
everything	1
he	1
said,	1
thought,	1
or	1
did	1
had	1
reference	1
to	1
such	1
things.	1
Now	1
the	1
cloud	1
of	1
dust	1
he	1
had	1
seen	1
was	1
raised	1
by	1
two	1
great	1
droves	1
of	1
sheep	1
coming	1
along	1
the	1
same	1
road	1
in	1
opposite	1
directions,	1
which,	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
dust,	1
did	1
not	1
become	1
visible	1
until	1
they	1
drew	1
near,	1
but	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
asserted	1
so	1
positively	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
armies	1
that	1
Sancho	1
was	1
led	1
to	1
believe	1
it	1
and	1
say,	1
“Well,	1
and	1
what	1
are	1
we	1
to	1
do,	1
señor?”	1

“What?”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote:	1
“give	1
aid	1
and	1
assistance	1
to	1
the	1
weak	1
and	1
those	1
who	1
need	1
it;	1
and	1
thou	1
must	1
know,	1
Sancho,	1
that	1
this	1
which	1
comes	1
opposite	1
to	1
us	1
is	1
conducted	1
and	1
led	1
by	1
the	1
mighty	1
emperor	1
Alifanfaron,	1
lord	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
isle	1
of	1
Trapobana;	1
this	1
other	1
that	1
marches	1
behind	1
me	1
is	1
that	1
of	1
his	1
enemy	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
the	1
Garamantas,	1
Pentapolin	1
of	1
the	1
Bare	1
Arm,	1
for	1
he	1
always	1
goes	1
into	1
battle	1
with	1
his	1
right	1
arm	1
bare.”	1
“But	1
why	1
are	1
these	1
two	1
lords	1
such	1
enemies?”	1
“They	1
are	1
at	1
enmity,”	1
replied	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“because	1
this	1
Alifanfaron	1
is	1
a	1
furious	1
pagan	1
and	1
is	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
Pentapolin,	1
who	1
is	1
a	1
very	1
beautiful	1
and	1
moreover	1
gracious	1
lady,	1
and	1
a	1
Christian,	1
and	1
her	1
father	1
is	1
unwilling	1
to	1
bestow	1
her	1
upon	1
the	1
pagan	1
king	1
unless	1
he	1
first	1
abandons	1
the	1
religion	1
of	1
his	1
false	1
prophet	1
Mahomet,	1
and	1
adopts	1
his	1
own.”	1
“By	1
my	1
beard,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“but	1
Pentapolin	1
does	1
quite	1
right,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
help	1
him	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
I	1
can.”	1
“In	1
that	1
thou	1
wilt	1
do	1
what	1
is	1
thy	1
duty,	1
Sancho,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
“for	1
to	1
engage	1
in	1
battles	1
of	1
this	1
sort	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
requisite	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
dubbed	1
knight.”	1
“That	1
I	1
can	1
well	1
understand,”	1
answered	1
Sancho;	1
“but	1
where	1
shall	1
we	1
put	1
this	1
ass	1
where	1
we	1
may	1
be	1
sure	1
to	1
find	1
him	1
after	1
the	1
fray	1
is	1
over?	1
for	1
I	1
believe	1
it	1
has	1
not	1
been	1
the	1
custom	1
so	1
far	1
to	1
go	1
into	1
battle	1
on	1
a	1
beast	1
of	1
this	1
kind.”	1
“That	1
is	1
true,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“and	1
what	1
you	1
had	1
best	1
do	1
with	1
him	1
is	1
to	1
leave	1
him	1
to	1
take	1
his	1
chance	1
whether	1
he	1
be	1
lost	1
or	1
not,	1
for	1
the	1
horses	1
we	1
shall	1
have	1
when	1
we	1
come	1
out	1
victors	1
will	1
be	1
so	1
many	1
that	1
even	1
Rocinante	1
will	1
run	1
a	1
risk	1
of	1
being	1
changed	1
for	1
another.	1
But	1
attend	1
to	1
me	1
and	1
observe,	1
for	1
I	1
wish	1
to	1
give	1
thee	1
some	1
account	1
of	1
the	1
chief	1
knights	1
who	1
accompany	1
these	1
two	1
armies;	1
and	1
that	1
thou	1
mayest	1
the	1
better	1
see	1
and	1
mark,	1
let	1
us	1
withdraw	1
to	1
that	1
hillock	1
which	1
rises	1
yonder,	1
whence	1
both	1
armies	1
may	1
be	1
seen.”	1
They	1
did	1
so,	1
and	1
placed	1
themselves	1
on	1
a	1
rising	1
ground	1
from	1
which	1
the	1
two	1
droves	1
that	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
made	1
armies	1
of	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
plainly	1
seen	1
if	1
the	1
clouds	1
of	1
dust	1
they	1
raised	1
had	1
not	1
obscured	1
them	1
and	1
blinded	1
the	1
sight;	1
nevertheless,	1
seeing	1
in	1
his	1
imagination	1
what	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
see	1
and	1
what	1
did	1
not	1
exist,	1
he	1
began	1
thus	1
in	1
a	1
loud	1
voice:	1
“That	1
knight	1
whom	1
thou	1
seest	1
yonder	1
in	1
yellow	1
armour,	1
who	1
bears	1
upon	1
his	1
shield	1
a	1
lion	1
crowned	1
crouching	1
at	1
the	1
feet	1
of	1
a	1
damsel,	1
is	1
the	1
valiant	1
Laurcalco,	1
lord	1
of	1
the	1
Silver	1
Bridge;	1
that	1
one	1
in	1
armour	1
with	1
flowers	1
of	1
gold,	1
who	1
bears	1
on	1
his	1
shield	1
three	1
crowns	1
argent	1
on	1
an	1
azure	1
field,	1
is	1
the	1
dreaded	1
Micocolembo,	1
grand	1
duke	1
of	1
Quirocia;	1
that	1
other	1
of	1
gigantic	1
frame,	1
on	1
his	1
right	1
hand,	1
is	1
the	1
ever	1
dauntless	1
Brandabarbaran	1
de	1
Boliche,	1
lord	1
of	1
the	1
three	1
Arabias,	1
who	1
for	1
armour	1
wears	1
that	1
serpent	1
skin,	1
and	1
has	1
for	1
shield	1
a	1
gate	1
which,	1
according	1
to	1
tradition,	1
is	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
of	1
the	1
temple	1
that	1
Samson	1
brought	1
to	1
the	1
ground	1
when	1
by	1
his	1
death	1
he	1
revenged	1
himself	1
upon	1
his	1
enemies.	1
But	1
turn	1
thine	1
eyes	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
side,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
see	1
in	1
front	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
van	1
of	1
this	1
other	1
army	1
the	1
ever	1
victorious	1
and	1
never	1
vanquished	1
Timonel	1
of	1
Carcajona,	1
prince	1
of	1
New	1
Biscay,	1
who	1
comes	1
in	1
armour	1
with	1
arms	1
quartered	1
azure,	1
vert,	1
white,	1
and	1
yellow,	1
and	1
bears	1
on	1
his	1
shield	1
a	1
cat	1
or	1
on	1
a	1
field	1
tawny	1
with	1
a	1
motto	1
which	1
says	1
_Miau_,	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
his	1
lady,	1
who	1
according	1
to	1
report	1
is	1
the	1
peerless	1
Miaulina,	1
daughter	1
of	1
the	1
duke	1
Alfeniquen	1
of	1
the	1
Algarve;	1
the	1
other,	1
who	1
burdens	1
and	1
presses	1
the	1
loins	1
of	1
that	1
powerful	1
charger	1
and	1
bears	1
arms	1
white	1
as	1
snow	1
and	1
a	1
shield	1
blank	1
and	1
without	1
any	1
device,	1
is	1
a	1
novice	1
knight,	1
a	1
Frenchman	1
by	1
birth,	1
Pierres	1
Papin	1
by	1
name,	1
lord	1
of	1
the	1
baronies	1
of	1
Utrique;	1
that	1
other,	1
who	1
with	1
iron-shod	1
heels	1
strikes	1
the	1
flanks	1
of	1
that	1
nimble	1
parti-coloured	1
zebra,	1
and	1
for	1
arms	1
bears	1
azure	1
vair,	1
is	1
the	1
mighty	1
duke	1
of	1
Nerbia,	1
Espartafilardo	1
del	1
Bosque,	1
who	1
bears	1
for	1
device	1
on	1
his	1
shield	1
an	1
asparagus	1
plant	1
with	1
a	1
motto	1
in	1
Castilian	1
that	1
says,	1
_‘Rastrea	1
mi	1
suerte’_.”	1
And	1
so	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
naming	1
a	1
number	1
of	1
knights	1
of	1
one	1
squadron	1
or	1
the	1
other	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
imagination,	1
and	1
to	1
all	1
he	1
assigned	1
off-hand	1
their	1
arms,	1
colours,	1
devices,	1
and	1
mottoes,	1
carried	1
away	1
by	1
the	1
illusions	1
of	1
his	1
unheard-of	1
craze;	1
and	1
without	1
a	1
pause,	1
he	1
continued,	1
“People	1
of	1
divers	1
nations	1
compose	1
this	1
squadron	1
in	1
front;	1
here	1
are	1
those	1
that	1
drink	1
of	1
the	1
sweet	1
waters	1
of	1
the	1
famous	1
Xanthus,	1
those	1
that	1
scour	1
the	1
woody	1
Massilian	1
plains,	1
those	1
that	1
sift	1
the	1
pure	1
fine	1
gold	1
of	1
Arabia	1
Felix,	1
those	1
that	1
enjoy	1
the	1
famed	1
cool	1
banks	1
of	1
the	1
crystal	1
Thermodon,	1
those	1
that	1
in	1
many	1
and	1
various	1
ways	1
divert	1
the	1
streams	1
of	1
the	1
golden	1
Pactolus,	1
the	1
Numidians,	1
faithless	1
in	1
their	1
promises,	1
the	1
Persians	1
renowned	1
in	1
archery,	1
the	1
Parthians	1
and	1
the	1
Medes	1
that	1
fight	1
as	1
they	1
fly,	1
the	1
Arabs	1
that	1
ever	1
shift	1
their	1
dwellings,	1
the	1
Scythians	1
as	1
cruel	1
as	1
they	1
are	1
fair,	1
the	1
Ethiopians	1
with	1
pierced	1
lips,	1
and	1
an	1
infinity	1
of	1
other	1
nations	1
whose	1
features	1
I	1
recognise	1
and	1
descry,	1
though	1
I	1
cannot	1
recall	1
their	1
names.	1
In	1
this	1
other	1
squadron	1
there	1
come	1
those	1
that	1
drink	1
of	1
the	1
crystal	1
streams	1
of	1
the	1
olive-bearing	1
Betis,	1
those	1
that	1
make	1
smooth	1
their	1
countenances	1
with	1
the	1
water	1
of	1
the	1
ever	1
rich	1
and	1
golden	1
Tagus,	1
those	1
that	1
rejoice	1
in	1
the	1
fertilising	1
flow	1
of	1
the	1
divine	1
Genil,	1
those	1
that	1
roam	1
the	1
Tartesian	1
plains	1
abounding	1
in	1
pasture,	1
those	1
that	1
take	1
their	1
pleasure	1
in	1
the	1
Elysian	1
meadows	1
of	1
Jerez,	1
the	1
rich	1
Manchegans	1
crowned	1
with	1
ruddy	1
ears	1
of	1
corn,	1
the	1
wearers	1
of	1
iron,	1
old	1
relics	1
of	1
the	1
Gothic	1
race,	1
those	1
that	1
bathe	1
in	1
the	1
Pisuerga	1
renowned	1
for	1
its	1
gentle	1
current,	1
those	1
that	1
feed	1
their	1
herds	1
along	1
the	1
spreading	1
pastures	1
of	1
the	1
winding	1
Guadiana	1
famed	1
for	1
its	1
hidden	1
course,	1
those	1
that	1
tremble	1
with	1
the	1
cold	1
of	1
the	1
pineclad	1
Pyrenees	1
or	1
the	1
dazzling	1
snows	1
of	1
the	1
lofty	1
Apennine;	1
in	1
a	1
word,	1
as	1
many	1
as	1
all	1
Europe	1
includes	1
and	1
contains.”	1
Good	1
God!	1
what	1
a	1
number	1
of	1
countries	1
and	1
nations	1
he	1
named!	1
giving	1
to	1
each	1
its	1
proper	1
attributes	1
with	1
marvellous	1
readiness;	1
brimful	1
and	1
saturated	1
with	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
read	1
in	1
his	1
lying	1
books!	1
Sancho	1
Panza	1
hung	1
upon	1
his	1
words	1
without	1
speaking,	1
and	1
from	1
time	1
to	1
time	1
turned	1
to	1
try	1
if	1
he	1
could	1
see	1
the	1
knights	1
and	1
giants	1
his	1
master	1
was	1
describing,	1
and	1
as	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
make	1
out	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
him:	1
“Señor,	1
devil	1
take	1
it	1
if	1
there’s	1
a	1
sign	1
of	1
any	1
man	1
you	1
talk	1
of,	1
knight	1
or	1
giant,	1
in	1
the	1
whole	1
thing;	1
maybe	1
it’s	1
all	1
enchantment,	1
like	1
the	1
phantoms	1
last	1
night.”	1
“How	1
canst	1
thou	1
say	1
that!”	1
answered	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
“dost	1
thou	1
not	1
hear	1
the	1
neighing	1
of	1
the	1
steeds,	1
the	1
braying	1
of	1
the	1
trumpets,	1
the	1
roll	1
of	1
the	1
drums?”	1
“I	1
hear	1
nothing	1
but	1
a	1
great	1
bleating	1
of	1
ewes	1
and	1
sheep,”	1
said	1
Sancho;	1
which	1
was	1
true,	1
for	1
by	1
this	1
time	1
the	1
two	1
flocks	1
had	1
come	1
close.	1
“The	1
fear	1
thou	1
art	1
in,	1
Sancho,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“prevents	1
thee	1
from	1
seeing	1
or	1
hearing	1
correctly,	1
for	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
effects	1
of	1
fear	1
is	1
to	1
derange	1
the	1
senses	1
and	1
make	1
things	1
appear	1
different	1
from	1
what	1
they	1
are;	1
if	1
thou	1
art	1
in	1
such	1
fear,	1
withdraw	1
to	1
one	1
side	1
and	1
leave	1
me	1
to	1
myself,	1
for	1
alone	1
I	1
suffice	1
to	1
bring	1
victory	1
to	1
that	1
side	1
to	1
which	1
I	1
shall	1
give	1
my	1
aid;”	1
and	1
so	1
saying	1
he	1
gave	1
Rocinante	1
the	1
spur,	1
and	1
putting	1
the	1
lance	1
in	1
rest,	1
shot	1
down	1
the	1
slope	1
like	1
a	1
thunderbolt.	1
Sancho	1
shouted	1
after	1
him,	1
crying,	1
“Come	1
back,	1
Señor	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
I	1
vow	1
to	1
God	1
they	1
are	1
sheep	1
and	1
ewes	1
you	1
are	1
charging!	1
Come	1
back!	1
Unlucky	1
the	1
father	1
that	1
begot	1
me!	1
what	1
madness	1
is	1
this!	1
Look,	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
giant,	1
nor	1
knight,	1
nor	1
cats,	1
nor	1
arms,	1
nor	1
shields	1
quartered	1
or	1
whole,	1
nor	1
vair	1
azure	1
or	1
bedevilled.	1
What	1
are	1
you	1
about?	1
Sinner	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
before	1
God!”	1
But	1
not	1
for	1
all	1
these	1
entreaties	1
did	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
turn	1
back;	1
on	1
the	1
contrary	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
shouting	1
out,	1
“Ho,	1
knights,	1
ye	1
who	1
follow	1
and	1
fight	1
under	1
the	1
banners	1
of	1
the	1
valiant	1
emperor	1
Pentapolin	1
of	1
the	1
Bare	1
Arm,	1
follow	1
me	1
all;	1
ye	1
shall	1
see	1
how	1
easily	1
I	1
shall	1
give	1
him	1
his	1
revenge	1
over	1
his	1
enemy	1
Alifanfaron	1
of	1
the	1
Trapobana.”	1
So	1
saying,	1
he	1
dashed	1
into	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
squadron	1
of	1
ewes,	1
and	1
began	1
spearing	1
them	1
with	1
as	1
much	1
spirit	1
and	1
intrepidity	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
were	1
transfixing	1
mortal	1
enemies	1
in	1
earnest.	1
The	1
shepherds	1
and	1
drovers	1
accompanying	1
the	1
flock	1
shouted	1
to	1
him	1
to	1
desist;	1
seeing	1
it	1
was	1
no	1
use,	1
they	1
ungirt	1
their	1
slings	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
salute	1
his	1
ears	1
with	1
stones	1
as	1
big	1
as	1
one’s	1
fist.	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
gave	1
no	1
heed	1
to	1
the	1
stones,	1
but,	1
letting	1
drive	1
right	1
and	1
left	1
kept	1
saying:	1
“Where	1
art	1
thou,	1
proud	1
Alifanfaron?	1
Come	1
before	1
me;	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
single	1
knight	1
who	1
would	1
fain	1
prove	1
thy	1
prowess	1
hand	1
to	1
hand,	1
and	1
make	1
thee	1
yield	1
thy	1
life	1
a	1
penalty	1
for	1
the	1
wrong	1
thou	1
dost	1
to	1
the	1
valiant	1
Pentapolin	1
Garamanta.”	1
Here	1
came	1
a	1
sugar-plum	1
from	1
the	1
brook	1
that	1
struck	1
him	1
on	1
the	1
side	1
and	1
buried	1
a	1
couple	1
of	1
ribs	1
in	1
his	1
body.	1
Feeling	1
himself	1
so	1
smitten,	1
he	1
imagined	1
himself	1
slain	1
or	1
badly	1
wounded	1
for	1
certain,	1
and	1
recollecting	1
his	1
liquor	1
he	1
drew	1
out	1
his	1
flask,	1
and	1
putting	1
it	1
to	1
his	1
mouth	1
began	1
to	1
pour	1
the	1
contents	1
into	1
his	1
stomach;	1
but	1
ere	1
he	1
had	1
succeeded	1
in	1
swallowing	1
what	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
enough,	1
there	1
came	1
another	1
almond	1
which	1
struck	1
him	1
on	1
the	1
hand	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
flask	1
so	1
fairly	1
that	1
it	1
smashed	1
it	1
to	1
pieces,	1
knocking	1
three	1
or	1
four	1
teeth	1
and	1
grinders	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
mouth	1
in	1
its	1
course,	1
and	1
sorely	1
crushing	1
two	1
fingers	1
of	1
his	1
hand.	1
Such	1
was	1
the	1
force	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
blow	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
second,	1
that	1
the	1
poor	1
knight	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
himself	1
came	1
down	1
backwards	1
off	1
his	1
horse.	1
The	1
shepherds	1
came	1
up,	1
and	1
felt	1
sure	1
they	1
had	1
killed	1
him;	1
so	1
in	1
all	1
haste	1
they	1
collected	1
their	1
flock	1
together,	1
took	1
up	1
the	1
dead	1
beasts,	1
of	1
which	1
there	1
were	1
more	1
than	1
seven,	1
and	1
made	1
off	1
without	1
waiting	1
to	1
ascertain	1
anything	1
further.	1
All	1
this	1
time	1
Sancho	1
stood	1
on	1
the	1
hill	1
watching	1
the	1
crazy	1
feats	1
his	1
master	1
was	1
performing,	1
and	1
tearing	1
his	1
beard	1
and	1
cursing	1
the	1
hour	1
and	1
the	1
occasion	1
when	1
fortune	1
had	1
made	1
him	1
acquainted	1
with	1
him.	1
Seeing	1
him,	1
then,	1
brought	1
to	1
the	1
ground,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
shepherds	1
had	1
taken	1
themselves	1
off,	1
he	1
ran	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
found	1
him	1
in	1
very	1
bad	1
case,	1
though	1
not	1
unconscious;	1
and	1
said	1
he:	1
“Did	1
I	1
not	1
tell	1
you	1
to	1
come	1
back,	1
Señor	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
and	1
that	1
what	1
you	1
were	1
going	1
to	1
attack	1
were	1
not	1
armies	1
but	1
droves	1
of	1
sheep?”	1
“That’s	1
how	1
that	1
thief	1
of	1
a	1
sage,	1
my	1
enemy,	1
can	1
alter	1
and	1
falsify	1
things,”	1
answered	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
“thou	1
must	1
know,	1
Sancho,	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
very	1
easy	1
matter	1
for	1
those	1
of	1
his	1
sort	1
to	1
make	1
us	1
believe	1
what	1
they	1
choose;	1
and	1
this	1
malignant	1
being	1
who	1
persecutes	1
me,	1
envious	1
of	1
the	1
glory	1
he	1
knew	1
I	1
was	1
to	1
win	1
in	1
this	1
battle,	1
has	1
turned	1
the	1
squadrons	1
of	1
the	1
enemy	1
into	1
droves	1
of	1
sheep.	1
At	1
any	1
rate,	1
do	1
this	1
much,	1
I	1
beg	1
of	1
thee,	1
Sancho,	1
to	1
undeceive	1
thyself,	1
and	1
see	1
that	1
what	1
I	1
say	1
is	1
true;	1
mount	1
thy	1
ass	1
and	1
follow	1
them	1
quietly,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
see	1
that	1
when	1
they	1
have	1
gone	1
some	1
little	1
distance	1
from	1
this	1
they	1
will	1
return	1
to	1
their	1
original	1
shape	1
and,	1
ceasing	1
to	1
be	1
sheep,	1
become	1
men	1
in	1
all	1
respects	1
as	1
I	1
described	1
them	1
to	1
thee	1
at	1
first.	1
But	1
go	1
not	1
just	1
yet,	1
for	1
I	1
want	1
thy	1
help	1
and	1
assistance;	1
come	1
hither,	1
and	1
see	1
how	1
many	1
of	1
my	1
teeth	1
and	1
grinders	1
are	1
missing,	1
for	1
I	1
feel	1
as	1
if	1
there	1
was	1
not	1
one	1
left	1
in	1
my	1
mouth.”	1
Sancho	1
came	1
so	1
close	1
that	1
he	1
almost	1
put	1
his	1
eyes	1
into	1
his	1
mouth;	1
now	1
just	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
the	1
balsam	1
had	1
acted	1
on	1
the	1
stomach	1
of	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
so,	1
at	1
the	1
very	1
instant	1
when	1
Sancho	1
came	1
to	1
examine	1
his	1
mouth,	1
he	1
discharged	1
all	1
its	1
contents	1
with	1
more	1
force	1
than	1
a	1
musket,	1
and	1
full	1
into	1
the	1
beard	1
of	1
the	1
compassionate	1
squire.	1
“Holy	1
Mary!”	1
cried	1
Sancho,	1
“what	1
is	1
this	1
that	1
has	1
happened	1
me?	1
Clearly	1
this	1
sinner	1
is	1
mortally	1
wounded,	1
as	1
he	1
vomits	1
blood	1
from	1
the	1
mouth;”	1
but	1
considering	1
the	1
matter	1
a	1
little	1
more	1
closely	1
he	1
perceived	1
by	1
the	1
colour,	1
taste,	1
and	1
smell,	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
blood	1
but	1
the	1
balsam	1
from	1
the	1
flask	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
seen	1
him	1
drink;	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
taken	1
with	1
such	1
a	1
loathing	1
that	1
his	1
stomach	1
turned,	1
and	1
he	1
vomited	1
up	1
his	1
inside	1
over	1
his	1
very	1
master,	1
and	1
both	1
were	1
left	1
in	1
a	1
precious	1
state.	1
Sancho	1
ran	1
to	1
his	1
ass	1
to	1
get	1
something	1
wherewith	1
to	1
clean	1
himself,	1
and	1
relieve	1
his	1
master,	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
alforjas;	1
but	1
not	1
finding	1
them,	1
he	1
well-nigh	1
took	1
leave	1
of	1
his	1
senses,	1
and	1
cursed	1
himself	1
anew,	1
and	1
in	1
his	1
heart	1
resolved	1
to	1
quit	1
his	1
master	1
and	1
return	1
home,	1
even	1
though	1
he	1
forfeited	1
the	1
wages	1
of	1
his	1
service	1
and	1
all	1
hopes	1
of	1
the	1
promised	1
island.	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
now	1
rose,	1
and	1
putting	1
his	1
left	1
hand	1
to	1
his	1
mouth	1
to	1
keep	1
his	1
teeth	1
from	1
falling	1
out	1
altogether,	1
with	1
the	1
other	1
he	1
laid	1
hold	1
of	1
the	1
bridle	1
of	1
Rocinante,	1
who	1
had	1
never	1
stirred	1
from	1
his	1
master’s	1
side—so	1
loyal	1
and	1
well-behaved	1
was	1
he—and	1
betook	1
himself	1
to	1
where	1
the	1
squire	1
stood	1
leaning	1
over	1
his	1
ass	1
with	1
his	1
hand	1
to	1
his	1
cheek,	1
like	1
one	1
in	1
deep	1
dejection.	1
Seeing	1
him	1
in	1
this	1
mood,	1
looking	1
so	1
sad,	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
said	1
to	1
him:	1
“Bear	1
in	1
mind,	1
Sancho,	1
that	1
one	1
man	1
is	1
no	1
more	1
than	1
another,	1
unless	1
he	1
does	1
more	1
than	1
another;	1
all	1
these	1
tempests	1
that	1
fall	1
upon	1
us	1
are	1
signs	1
that	1
fair	1
weather	1
is	1
coming	1
shortly,	1
and	1
that	1
things	1
will	1
go	1
well	1
with	1
us,	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
impossible	1
for	1
good	1
or	1
evil	1
to	1
last	1
for	1
ever;	1
and	1
hence	1
it	1
follows	1
that	1
the	1
evil	1
having	1
lasted	1
long,	1
the	1
good	1
must	1
be	1
now	1
nigh	1
at	1
hand;	1
so	1
thou	1
must	1
not	1
distress	1
thyself	1
at	1
the	1
misfortunes	1
which	1
happen	1
to	1
me,	1
since	1
thou	1
hast	1
no	1
share	1
in	1
them.”	1
“How	1
have	1
I	1
not?”	1
replied	1
Sancho;	1
“was	1
he	1
whom	1
they	1
blanketed	1
yesterday	1
perchance	1
any	1
other	1
than	1
my	1
father’s	1
son?	1
and	1
the	1
alforjas	1
that	1
are	1
missing	1
to-day	1
with	1
all	1
my	1
treasures,	1
did	1
they	1
belong	1
to	1
any	1
other	1
but	1
myself?”	1
“What!	1
are	1
the	1
alforjas	1
missing,	1
Sancho?”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote.	1
“Yes,	1
they	1
are	1
missing,”	1
answered	1
Sancho.	1
“In	1
that	1
case	1
we	1
have	1
nothing	1
to	1
eat	1
to-day,”	1
replied	1
Don	1
Quixote.	1
“It	1
would	1
be	1
so,”	1
answered	1
Sancho,	1
“if	1
there	1
were	1
none	1
of	1
the	1
herbs	1
your	1
worship	1
says	1
you	1
know	1
in	1
these	1
meadows,	1
those	1
with	1
which	1
knights-errant	1
as	1
unlucky	1
as	1
your	1
worship	1
are	1
wont	1
to	1
supply	1
such-like	1
shortcomings.”	1
“For	1
all	1
that,”	1
answered	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“I	1
would	1
rather	1
have	1
just	1
now	1
a	1
quarter	1
of	1
bread,	1
or	1
a	1
loaf	1
and	1
a	1
couple	1
of	1
pilchards’	1
heads,	1
than	1
all	1
the	1
herbs	1
described	1
by	1
Dioscorides,	1
even	1
with	1
Doctor	1
Laguna’s	1
notes.	1
Nevertheless,	1
Sancho	1
the	1
Good,	1
mount	1
thy	1
beast	1
and	1
come	1
along	1
with	1
me,	1
for	1
God,	1
who	1
provides	1
for	1
all	1
things,	1
will	1
not	1
fail	1
us	1
(more	1
especially	1
when	1
we	1
are	1
so	1
active	1
in	1
his	1
service	1
as	1
we	1
are),	1
since	1
he	1
fails	1
not	1
the	1
midges	1
of	1
the	1
air,	1
nor	1
the	1
grubs	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
nor	1
the	1
tadpoles	1
of	1
the	1
water,	1
and	1
is	1
so	1
merciful	1
that	1
he	1
maketh	1
his	1
sun	1
to	1
rise	1
on	1
the	1
good	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
evil,	1
and	1
sendeth	1
rain	1
on	1
the	1
unjust	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
just.”	1
“Your	1
worship	1
would	1
make	1
a	1
better	1
preacher	1
than	1
knight-errant,”	1
said	1
Sancho.	1
“Knights-errant	1
knew	1
and	1
ought	1
to	1
know	1
everything,	1
Sancho,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
“for	1
there	1
were	1
knights-errant	1
in	1
former	1
times	1
as	1
well	1
qualified	1
to	1
deliver	1
a	1
sermon	1
or	1
discourse	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
an	1
encampment,	1
as	1
if	1
they	1
had	1
graduated	1
in	1
the	1
University	1
of	1
Paris;	1
whereby	1
we	1
may	1
see	1
that	1
the	1
lance	1
has	1
never	1
blunted	1
the	1
pen,	1
nor	1
the	1
pen	1
the	1
lance.”	1
“Well,	1
be	1
it	1
as	1
your	1
worship	1
says,”	1
replied	1
Sancho;	1
“let	1
us	1
be	1
off	1
now	1
and	1
find	1
some	1
place	1
of	1
shelter	1
for	1
the	1
night,	1
and	1
God	1
grant	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
somewhere	1
where	1
there	1
are	1
no	1
blankets,	1
nor	1
blanketeers,	1
nor	1
phantoms,	1
nor	1
enchanted	1
Moors;	1
for	1
if	1
there	1
are,	1
may	1
the	1
devil	1
take	1
the	1
whole	1
concern.”	1
“Ask	1
that	1
of	1
God,	1
my	1
son,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
and	1
do	1
thou	1
lead	1
on	1
where	1
thou	1
wilt,	1
for	1
this	1
time	1
I	1
leave	1
our	1
lodging	1
to	1
thy	1
choice;	1
but	1
reach	1
me	1
here	1
thy	1
hand,	1
and	1
feel	1
with	1
thy	1
finger,	1
and	1
find	1
out	1
how	1
many	1
of	1
my	1
teeth	1
and	1
grinders	1
are	1
missing	1
from	1
this	1
right	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
upper	1
jaw,	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
there	1
I	1
feel	1
the	1
pain.”	1
Sancho	1
put	1
in	1
his	1
fingers,	1
and	1
feeling	1
about	1
asked	1
him,	1
“How	1
many	1
grinders	1
used	1
your	1
worship	1
have	1
on	1
this	1
side?”	1
“Four,”	1
replied	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“besides	1
the	1
back-tooth,	1
all	1
whole	1
and	1
quite	1
sound.”	1
“Mind	1
what	1
you	1
are	1
saying,	1
señor.”	1
“I	1
say	1
four,	1
if	1
not	1
five,”	1
answered	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“for	1
never	1
in	1
my	1
life	1
have	1
I	1
had	1
tooth	1
or	1
grinder	1
drawn,	1
nor	1
has	1
any	1
fallen	1
out	1
or	1
been	1
destroyed	1
by	1
any	1
decay	1
or	1
rheum.”	1
“Well,	1
then,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“in	1
this	1
lower	1
side	1
your	1
worship	1
has	1
no	1
more	1
than	1
two	1
grinders	1
and	1
a	1
half,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
upper	1
neither	1
a	1
half	1
nor	1
any	1
at	1
all,	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
all	1
as	1
smooth	1
as	1
the	1
palm	1
of	1
my	1
hand.”	1
“Luckless	1
that	1
I	1
am!”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
hearing	1
the	1
sad	1
news	1
his	1
squire	1
gave	1
him;	1
“I	1
had	1
rather	1
they	1
despoiled	1
me	1
of	1
an	1
arm,	1
so	1
it	1
were	1
not	1
the	1
sword-arm;	1
for	1
I	1
tell	1
thee,	1
Sancho,	1
a	1
mouth	1
without	1
teeth	1
is	1
like	1
a	1
mill	1
without	1
a	1
millstone,	1
and	1
a	1
tooth	1
is	1
much	1
more	1
to	1
be	1
prized	1
than	1
a	1
diamond;	1
but	1
we	1
who	1
profess	1
the	1
austere	1
order	1
of	1
chivalry	1
are	1
liable	1
to	1
all	1
this.	1
Mount,	1
friend,	1
and	1
lead	1
the	1
way,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
follow	1
thee	1
at	1
whatever	1
pace	1
thou	1
wilt.”	1
Sancho	1
did	1
as	1
he	1
bade	1
him,	1
and	1
proceeded	1
in	1
the	1
direction	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
thought	1
he	1
might	1
find	1
refuge	1
without	1
quitting	1
the	1
high	1
road,	1
which	1
was	1
there	1
very	1
much	1
frequented.	1
As	1
they	1
went	1
along,	1
then,	1
at	1
a	1
slow	1
pace—for	1
the	1
pain	1
in	1
Don	1
Quixote’s	1
jaws	1
kept	1
him	1
uneasy	1
and	1
ill-disposed	1
for	1
speed—Sancho	1
thought	1
it	1
well	1
to	1
amuse	1
and	1
divert	1
him	1
by	1
talk	1
of	1
some	1
kind,	1
and	1
among	1
the	1
things	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
him	1
was	1
that	1
which	1
will	1
be	1
told	1
in	1
the	1
following	1
chapter.	1

CHAPTER	1
XIX.	1
OF	1
THE	1
SHREWD	1
DISCOURSE	1
WHICH	1
SANCHO	1
HELD	1
WITH	1
HIS	1
MASTER,	1
AND	1
OF	1
THE	1
ADVENTURE	1
THAT	1
BEFELL	1
HIM	1
WITH	1
A	1
DEAD	1
BODY,	1
TOGETHER	1
WITH	1
OTHER	1
NOTABLE	1
OCCURRENCES	1
“It	1
seems	1
to	1
me,	1
señor,	1
that	1
all	1
these	1
mishaps	1
that	1
have	1
befallen	1
us	1
of	1
late	1
have	1
been	1
without	1
any	1
doubt	1
a	1
punishment	1
for	1
the	1
offence	1
committed	1
by	1
your	1
worship	1
against	1
the	1
order	1
of	1
chivalry	1
in	1
not	1
keeping	1
the	1
oath	1
you	1
made	1
not	1
to	1
eat	1
bread	1
off	1
a	1
tablecloth	1
or	1
embrace	1
the	1
queen,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
it	1
that	1
your	1
worship	1
swore	1
to	1
observe	1
until	1
you	1
had	1
taken	1
that	1
helmet	1
of	1
Malandrino’s,	1
or	1
whatever	1
the	1
Moor	1
is	1
called,	1
for	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
very	1
well	1
remember.”	1
“Thou	1
art	1
very	1
right,	1
Sancho,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“but	1
to	1
tell	1
the	1
truth,	1
it	1
had	1
escaped	1
my	1
memory;	1
and	1
likewise	1
thou	1
mayest	1
rely	1
upon	1
it	1
that	1
the	1
affair	1
of	1
the	1
blanket	1
happened	1
to	1
thee	1
because	1
of	1
thy	1
fault	1
in	1
not	1
reminding	1
me	1
of	1
it	1
in	1
time;	1
but	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
amends,	1
for	1
there	1
are	1
ways	1
of	1
compounding	1
for	1
everything	1
in	1
the	1
order	1
of	1
chivalry.”	1
“Why!	1
have	1
I	1
taken	1
an	1
oath	1
of	1
some	1
sort,	1
then?”	1
said	1
Sancho.	1
“It	1
makes	1
no	1
matter	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
not	1
taken	1
an	1
oath,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
“suffice	1
it	1
that	1
I	1
see	1
thou	1
art	1
not	1
quite	1
clear	1
of	1
complicity;	1
and	1
whether	1
or	1
no,	1
it	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
ill	1
done	1
to	1
provide	1
ourselves	1
with	1
a	1
remedy.”	1
“In	1
that	1
case,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“mind	1
that	1
your	1
worship	1
does	1
not	1
forget	1
this	1
as	1
you	1
did	1
the	1
oath;	1
perhaps	1
the	1
phantoms	1
may	1
take	1
it	1
into	1
their	1
heads	1
to	1
amuse	1
themselves	1
once	1
more	1
with	1
me;	1
or	1
even	1
with	1
your	1
worship	1
if	1
they	1
see	1
you	1
so	1
obstinate.”	1
While	1
engaged	1
in	1
this	1
and	1
other	1
talk,	1
night	1
overtook	1
them	1
on	1
the	1
road	1
before	1
they	1
had	1
reached	1
or	1
discovered	1
any	1
place	1
of	1
shelter;	1
and	1
what	1
made	1
it	1
still	1
worse	1
was	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
dying	1
of	1
hunger,	1
for	1
with	1
the	1
loss	1
of	1
the	1
alforjas	1
they	1
had	1
lost	1
their	1
entire	1
larder	1
and	1
commissariat;	1
and	1
to	1
complete	1
the	1
misfortune	1
they	1
met	1
with	1
an	1
adventure	1
which	1
without	1
any	1
invention	1
had	1
really	1
the	1
appearance	1
of	1
one.	1
It	1
so	1
happened	1
that	1
the	1
night	1
closed	1
in	1
somewhat	1
darkly,	1
but	1
for	1
all	1
that	1
they	1
pushed	1
on,	1
Sancho	1
feeling	1
sure	1
that	1
as	1
the	1
road	1
was	1
the	1
king’s	1
highway	1
they	1
might	1
reasonably	1
expect	1
to	1
find	1
some	1
inn	1
within	1
a	1
league	1
or	1
two.	1
Going	1
along,	1
then,	1
in	1
this	1
way,	1
the	1
night	1
dark,	1
the	1
squire	1
hungry,	1
the	1
master	1
sharp-set,	1
they	1
saw	1
coming	1
towards	1
them	1
on	1
the	1
road	1
they	1
were	1
travelling	1
a	1
great	1
number	1
of	1
lights	1
which	1
looked	1
exactly	1
like	1
stars	1
in	1
motion.	1
Sancho	1
was	1
taken	1
aback	1
at	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
them,	1
nor	1
did	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
altogether	1
relish	1
them:	1
the	1
one	1
pulled	1
up	1
his	1
ass	1
by	1
the	1
halter,	1
the	1
other	1
his	1
hack	1
by	1
the	1
bridle,	1
and	1
they	1
stood	1
still,	1
watching	1
anxiously	1
to	1
see	1
what	1
all	1
this	1
would	1
turn	1
out	1
to	1
be,	1
and	1
found	1
that	1
the	1
lights	1
were	1
approaching	1
them,	1
and	1
the	1
nearer	1
they	1
came	1
the	1
greater	1
they	1
seemed,	1
at	1
which	1
spectacle	1
Sancho	1
began	1
to	1
shake	1
like	1
a	1
man	1
dosed	1
with	1
mercury,	1
and	1
Don	1
Quixote’s	1
hair	1
stood	1
on	1
end;	1
he,	1
however,	1
plucking	1
up	1
spirit	1
a	1
little,	1
said:	1
“This,	1
no	1
doubt,	1
Sancho,	1
will	1
be	1
a	1
most	1
mighty	1
and	1
perilous	1
adventure,	1
in	1
which	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
needful	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
put	1
forth	1
all	1
my	1
valour	1
and	1
resolution.”	1
“Unlucky	1
me!”	1
answered	1
Sancho;	1
“if	1
this	1
adventure	1
happens	1
to	1
be	1
one	1
of	1
phantoms,	1
as	1
I	1
am	1
beginning	1
to	1
think	1
it	1
is,	1
where	1
shall	1
I	1
find	1
the	1
ribs	1
to	1
bear	1
it?”	1
“Be	1
they	1
phantoms	1
ever	1
so	1
much,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“I	1
will	1
not	1
permit	1
them	1
to	1
touch	1
a	1
thread	1
of	1
thy	1
garments;	1
for	1
if	1
they	1
played	1
tricks	1
with	1
thee	1
the	1
time	1
before,	1
it	1
was	1
because	1
I	1
was	1
unable	1
to	1
leap	1
the	1
walls	1
of	1
the	1
yard;	1
but	1
now	1
we	1
are	1
on	1
a	1
wide	1
plain,	1
where	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
wield	1
my	1
sword	1
as	1
I	1
please.”	1
“And	1
if	1
they	1
enchant	1
and	1
cripple	1
you	1
as	1
they	1
did	1
the	1
last	1
time,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“what	1
difference	1
will	1
it	1
make	1
being	1
on	1
the	1
open	1
plain	1
or	1
not?”	1
“For	1
all	1
that,”	1
replied	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“I	1
entreat	1
thee,	1
Sancho,	1
to	1
keep	1
a	1
good	1
heart,	1
for	1
experience	1
will	1
tell	1
thee	1
what	1
mine	1
is.”	1
“I	1
will,	1
please	1
God,”	1
answered	1
Sancho,	1
and	1
the	1
two	1
retiring	1
to	1
one	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
road	1
set	1
themselves	1
to	1
observe	1
closely	1
what	1
all	1
these	1
moving	1
lights	1
might	1
be;	1
and	1
very	1
soon	1
afterwards	1
they	1
made	1
out	1
some	1
twenty	1
encamisados,	1
all	1
on	1
horseback,	1
with	1
lighted	1
torches	1
in	1
their	1
hands,	1
the	1
awe-inspiring	1
aspect	1
of	1
whom	1
completely	1
extinguished	1
the	1
courage	1
of	1
Sancho,	1
who	1
began	1
to	1
chatter	1
with	1
his	1
teeth	1
like	1
one	1
in	1
the	1
cold	1
fit	1
of	1
an	1
ague;	1
and	1
his	1
heart	1
sank	1
and	1
his	1
teeth	1
chattered	1
still	1
more	1
when	1
they	1
perceived	1
distinctly	1
that	1
behind	1
them	1
there	1
came	1
a	1
litter	1
covered	1
over	1
with	1
black	1
and	1
followed	1
by	1
six	1
more	1
mounted	1
figures	1
in	1
mourning	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
very	1
feet	1
of	1
their	1
mules—for	1
they	1
could	1
perceive	1
plainly	1
they	1
were	1
not	1
horses	1
by	1
the	1
easy	1
pace	1
at	1
which	1
they	1
went.	1
And	1
as	1
the	1
encamisados	1
came	1
along	1
they	1
muttered	1
to	1
themselves	1
in	1
a	1
low	1
plaintive	1
tone.	1
This	1
strange	1
spectacle	1
at	1
such	1
an	1
hour	1
and	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
solitary	1
place	1
was	1
quite	1
enough	1
to	1
strike	1
terror	1
into	1
Sancho’s	1
heart,	1
and	1
even	1
into	1
his	1
master’s;	1
and	1
(save	1
in	1
Don	1
Quixote’s	1
case)	1
did	1
so,	1
for	1
all	1
Sancho’s	1
resolution	1
had	1
now	1
broken	1
down.	1
It	1
was	1
just	1
the	1
opposite	1
with	1
his	1
master,	1
whose	1
imagination	1
immediately	1
conjured	1
up	1
all	1
this	1
to	1
him	1
vividly	1
as	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
adventures	1
of	1
his	1
books.	1
He	1
took	1
it	1
into	1
his	1
head	1
that	1
the	1
litter	1
was	1
a	1
bier	1
on	1
which	1
was	1
borne	1
some	1
sorely	1
wounded	1
or	1
slain	1
knight,	1
to	1
avenge	1
whom	1
was	1
a	1
task	1
reserved	1
for	1
him	1
alone;	1
and	1
without	1
any	1
further	1
reasoning	1
he	1
laid	1
his	1
lance	1
in	1
rest,	1
fixed	1
himself	1
firmly	1
in	1
his	1
saddle,	1
and	1
with	1
gallant	1
spirit	1
and	1
bearing	1
took	1
up	1
his	1
position	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
road	1
where	1
the	1
encamisados	1
must	1
of	1
necessity	1
pass;	1
and	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
saw	1
them	1
near	1
at	1
hand	1
he	1
raised	1
his	1
voice	1
and	1
said:	1
“Halt,	1
knights,	1
or	1
whosoever	1
ye	1
may	1
be,	1
and	1
render	1
me	1
account	1
of	1
who	1
ye	1
are,	1
whence	1
ye	1
come,	1
where	1
ye	1
go,	1
what	1
it	1
is	1
ye	1
carry	1
upon	1
that	1
bier,	1
for,	1
to	1
judge	1
by	1
appearances,	1
either	1
ye	1
have	1
done	1
some	1
wrong	1
or	1
some	1
wrong	1
has	1
been	1
done	1
to	1
you,	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
fitting	1
and	1
necessary	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
know,	1
either	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
chastise	1
you	1
for	1
the	1
evil	1
ye	1
have	1
done,	1
or	1
else	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
avenge	1
you	1
for	1
the	1
injury	1
that	1
has	1
been	1
inflicted	1
upon	1
you.”	1
“We	1
are	1
in	1
haste,”	1
answered	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
encamisados,	1
“and	1
the	1
inn	1
is	1
far	1
off,	1
and	1
we	1
cannot	1
stop	1
to	1
render	1
you	1
such	1
an	1
account	1
as	1
you	1
demand;”	1
and	1
spurring	1
his	1
mule	1
he	1
moved	1
on.	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
was	1
mightily	1
provoked	1
by	1
this	1
answer,	1
and	1
seizing	1
the	1
mule	1
by	1
the	1
bridle	1
he	1
said,	1
“Halt,	1
and	1
be	1
more	1
mannerly,	1
and	1
render	1
an	1
account	1
of	1
what	1
I	1
have	1
asked	1
of	1
you;	1
else,	1
take	1
my	1
defiance	1
to	1
combat,	1
all	1
of	1
you.”	1
The	1
mule	1
was	1
shy,	1
and	1
was	1
so	1
frightened	1
at	1
her	1
bridle	1
being	1
seized	1
that	1
rearing	1
up	1
she	1
flung	1
her	1
rider	1
to	1
the	1
ground	1
over	1
her	1
haunches.	1
An	1
attendant	1
who	1
was	1
on	1
foot,	1
seeing	1
the	1
encamisado	1
fall,	1
began	1
to	1
abuse	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
who	1
now	1
moved	1
to	1
anger,	1
without	1
any	1
more	1
ado,	1
laying	1
his	1
lance	1
in	1
rest	1
charged	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
men	1
in	1
mourning	1
and	1
brought	1
him	1
badly	1
wounded	1
to	1
the	1
ground,	1
and	1
as	1
he	1
wheeled	1
round	1
upon	1
the	1
others	1
the	1
agility	1
with	1
which	1
he	1
attacked	1
and	1
routed	1
them	1
was	1
a	1
sight	1
to	1
see,	1
for	1
it	1
seemed	1
just	1
as	1
if	1
wings	1
had	1
that	1
instant	1
grown	1
upon	1
Rocinante,	1
so	1
lightly	1
and	1
proudly	1
did	1
he	1
bear	1
himself.	1
The	1
encamisados	1
were	1
all	1
timid	1
folk	1
and	1
unarmed,	1
so	1
they	1
speedily	1
made	1
their	1
escape	1
from	1
the	1
fray	1
and	1
set	1
off	1
at	1
a	1
run	1
across	1
the	1
plain	1
with	1
their	1
lighted	1
torches,	1
looking	1
exactly	1
like	1
maskers	1
running	1
on	1
some	1
gala	1
or	1
festival	1
night.	1
The	1
mourners,	1
too,	1
enveloped	1
and	1
swathed	1
in	1
their	1
skirts	1
and	1
gowns,	1
were	1
unable	1
to	1
bestir	1
themselves,	1
and	1
so	1
with	1
entire	1
safety	1
to	1
himself	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
belaboured	1
them	1
all	1
and	1
drove	1
them	1
off	1
against	1
their	1
will,	1
for	1
they	1
all	1
thought	1
it	1
was	1
no	1
man	1
but	1
a	1
devil	1
from	1
hell	1
come	1
to	1
carry	1
away	1
the	1
dead	1
body	1
they	1
had	1
in	1
the	1
litter.	1
Sancho	1
beheld	1
all	1
this	1
in	1
astonishment	1
at	1
the	1
intrepidity	1
of	1
his	1
lord,	1
and	1
said	1
to	1
himself,	1
“Clearly	1
this	1
master	1
of	1
mine	1
is	1
as	1
bold	1
and	1
valiant	1
as	1
he	1
says	1
he	1
is.”	1
A	1
burning	1
torch	1
lay	1
on	1
the	1
ground	1
near	1
the	1
first	1
man	1
whom	1
the	1
mule	1
had	1
thrown,	1
by	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
which	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
perceived	1
him,	1
and	1
coming	1
up	1
to	1
him	1
he	1
presented	1
the	1
point	1
of	1
the	1
lance	1
to	1
his	1
face,	1
calling	1
on	1
him	1
to	1
yield	1
himself	1
prisoner,	1
or	1
else	1
he	1
would	1
kill	1
him;	1
to	1
which	1
the	1
prostrate	1
man	1
replied,	1
“I	1
am	1
prisoner	1
enough	1
as	1
it	1
is;	1
I	1
cannot	1
stir,	1
for	1
one	1
of	1
my	1
legs	1
is	1
broken:	1
I	1
entreat	1
you,	1
if	1
you	1
be	1
a	1
Christian	1
gentleman,	1
not	1
to	1
kill	1
me,	1
which	1
will	1
be	1
committing	1
grave	1
sacrilege,	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
licentiate	1
and	1
I	1
hold	1
first	1
orders.”	1
“Then	1
what	1
the	1
devil	1
brought	1
you	1
here,	1
being	1
a	1
churchman?”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote.	1
“What,	1
señor?”	1
said	1
the	1
other.	1
“My	1
bad	1
luck.”	1
“Then	1
still	1
worse	1
awaits	1
you,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“if	1
you	1
do	1
not	1
satisfy	1
me	1
as	1
to	1
all	1
I	1
asked	1
you	1
at	1
first.”	1
“You	1
shall	1
be	1
soon	1
satisfied,”	1
said	1
the	1
licentiate;	1
“you	1
must	1
know,	1
then,	1
that	1
though	1
just	1
now	1
I	1
said	1
I	1
was	1
a	1
licentiate,	1
I	1
am	1
only	1
a	1
bachelor,	1
and	1
my	1
name	1
is	1
Alonzo	1
Lopez;	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
native	1
of	1
Alcobendas,	1
I	1
come	1
from	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
Baeza	1
with	1
eleven	1
others,	1
priests,	1
the	1
same	1
who	1
fled	1
with	1
the	1
torches,	1
and	1
we	1
are	1
going	1
to	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
Segovia	1
accompanying	1
a	1
dead	1
body	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
that	1
litter,	1
and	1
is	1
that	1
of	1
a	1
gentleman	1
who	1
died	1
in	1
Baeza,	1
where	1
he	1
was	1
interred;	1
and	1
now,	1
as	1
I	1
said,	1
we	1
are	1
taking	1
his	1
bones	1
to	1
their	1
burial-place,	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
Segovia,	1
where	1
he	1
was	1
born.”	1
“And	1
who	1
killed	1
him?”	1
asked	1
Don	1
Quixote.	1
“God,	1
by	1
means	1
of	1
a	1
malignant	1
fever	1
that	1
took	1
him,”	1
answered	1
the	1
bachelor.	1
“In	1
that	1
case,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“the	1
Lord	1
has	1
relieved	1
me	1
of	1
the	1
task	1
of	1
avenging	1
his	1
death	1
had	1
any	1
other	1
slain	1
him;	1
but,	1
he	1
who	1
slew	1
him	1
having	1
slain	1
him,	1
there	1
is	1
nothing	1
for	1
it	1
but	1
to	1
be	1
silent,	1
and	1
shrug	1
one’s	1
shoulders;	1
I	1
should	1
do	1
the	1
same	1
were	1
he	1
to	1
slay	1
myself;	1
and	1
I	1
would	1
have	1
your	1
reverence	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
knight	1
of	1
La	1
Mancha,	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
by	1
name,	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
my	1
business	1
and	1
calling	1
to	1
roam	1
the	1
world	1
righting	1
wrongs	1
and	1
redressing	1
injuries.”	1
“I	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
how	1
that	1
about	1
righting	1
wrongs	1
can	1
be,”	1
said	1
the	1
bachelor,	1
“for	1
from	1
straight	1
you	1
have	1
made	1
me	1
crooked,	1
leaving	1
me	1
with	1
a	1
broken	1
leg	1
that	1
will	1
never	1
see	1
itself	1
straight	1
again	1
all	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
its	1
life;	1
and	1
the	1
injury	1
you	1
have	1
redressed	1
in	1
my	1
case	1
has	1
been	1
to	1
leave	1
me	1
injured	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
way	1
that	1
I	1
shall	1
remain	1
injured	1
for	1
ever;	1
and	1
the	1
height	1
of	1
misadventure	1
it	1
was	1
to	1
fall	1
in	1
with	1
you	1
who	1
go	1
in	1
search	1
of	1
adventures.”	1
“Things	1
do	1
not	1
all	1
happen	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
way,”	1
answered	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
“it	1
all	1
came,	1
Sir	1
Bachelor	1
Alonzo	1
Lopez,	1
of	1
your	1
going,	1
as	1
you	1
did,	1
by	1
night,	1
dressed	1
in	1
those	1
surplices,	1
with	1
lighted	1
torches,	1
praying,	1
covered	1
with	1
mourning,	1
so	1
that	1
naturally	1
you	1
looked	1
like	1
something	1
evil	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
other	1
world;	1
and	1
so	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
avoid	1
doing	1
my	1
duty	1
in	1
attacking	1
you,	1
and	1
I	1
should	1
have	1
attacked	1
you	1
even	1
had	1
I	1
known	1
positively	1
that	1
you	1
were	1
the	1
very	1
devils	1
of	1
hell,	1
for	1
such	1
I	1
certainly	1
believed	1
and	1
took	1
you	1
to	1
be.”	1
“As	1
my	1
fate	1
has	1
so	1
willed	1
it,”	1
said	1
the	1
bachelor,	1
“I	1
entreat	1
you,	1
sir	1
knight-errant,	1
whose	1
errand	1
has	1
been	1
such	1
an	1
evil	1
one	1
for	1
me,	1
to	1
help	1
me	1
to	1
get	1
from	1
under	1
this	1
mule	1
that	1
holds	1
one	1
of	1
my	1
legs	1
caught	1
between	1
the	1
stirrup	1
and	1
the	1
saddle.”	1
“I	1
would	1
have	1
talked	1
on	1
till	1
to-morrow,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
“how	1
long	1
were	1
you	1
going	1
to	1
wait	1
before	1
telling	1
me	1
of	1
your	1
distress?”	1
He	1
at	1
once	1
called	1
to	1
Sancho,	1
who,	1
however,	1
had	1
no	1
mind	1
to	1
come,	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
just	1
then	1
engaged	1
in	1
unloading	1
a	1
sumpter	1
mule,	1
well	1
laden	1
with	1
provender,	1
which	1
these	1
worthy	1
gentlemen	1
had	1
brought	1
with	1
them.	1
Sancho	1
made	1
a	1
bag	1
of	1
his	1
coat,	1
and,	1
getting	1
together	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
he	1
could,	1
and	1
as	1
the	1
bag	1
would	1
hold,	1
he	1
loaded	1
his	1
beast,	1
and	1
then	1
hastened	1
to	1
obey	1
his	1
master’s	1
call,	1
and	1
helped	1
him	1
to	1
remove	1
the	1
bachelor	1
from	1
under	1
the	1
mule;	1
then	1
putting	1
him	1
on	1
her	1
back	1
he	1
gave	1
him	1
the	1
torch,	1
and	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
bade	1
him	1
follow	1
the	1
track	1
of	1
his	1
companions,	1
and	1
beg	1
pardon	1
of	1
them	1
on	1
his	1
part	1
for	1
the	1
wrong	1
which	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
doing	1
them.	1
And	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“If	1
by	1
chance	1
these	1
gentlemen	1
should	1
want	1
to	1
know	1
who	1
was	1
the	1
hero	1
that	1
served	1
them	1
so,	1
your	1
worship	1
may	1
tell	1
them	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
the	1
famous	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
of	1
La	1
Mancha,	1
otherwise	1
called	1
the	1
Knight	1
of	1
the	1
Rueful	1
Countenance.”	1
The	1
bachelor	1
then	1
took	1
his	1
departure.	1
I	1
forgot	1
to	1
mention	1
that	1
before	1
he	1
did	1
so	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“Remember	1
that	1
you	1
stand	1
excommunicated	1
for	1
having	1
laid	1
violent	1
hands	1
on	1
a	1
holy	1
thing,	1
_juxta	1
illud,	1
si	1
quis,	1
suadente	1
diabolo_.”	1
“I	1
do	1
not	1
understand	1
that	1
Latin,”	1
answered	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“but	1
I	1
know	1
well	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
lay	1
hands,	1
only	1
this	1
pike;	1
besides,	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
think	1
I	1
was	1
committing	1
an	1
assault	1
upon	1
priests	1
or	1
things	1
of	1
the	1
Church,	1
which,	1
like	1
a	1
Catholic	1
and	1
faithful	1
Christian	1
as	1
I	1
am,	1
I	1
respect	1
and	1
revere,	1
but	1
upon	1
phantoms	1
and	1
spectres	1
of	1
the	1
other	1
world;	1
but	1
even	1
so,	1
I	1
remember	1
how	1
it	1
fared	1
with	1
Cid	1
Ruy	1
Diaz	1
when	1
he	1
broke	1
the	1
chair	1
of	1
the	1
ambassador	1
of	1
that	1
king	1
before	1
his	1
Holiness	1
the	1
Pope,	1
who	1
excommunicated	1
him	1
for	1
the	1
same;	1
and	1
yet	1
the	1
good	1
Roderick	1
of	1
Vivar	1
bore	1
himself	1
that	1
day	1
like	1
a	1
very	1
noble	1
and	1
valiant	1
knight.”	1
On	1
hearing	1
this	1
the	1
bachelor	1
took	1
his	1
departure,	1
as	1
has	1
been	1
said,	1
without	1
making	1
any	1
reply;	1
and	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
asked	1
Sancho	1
what	1
had	1
induced	1
him	1
to	1
call	1
him	1
the	1
“Knight	1
of	1
the	1
Rueful	1
Countenance”	1
more	1
then	1
than	1
at	1
any	1
other	1
time.	1
“I	1
will	1
tell	1
you,”	1
answered	1
Sancho;	1
“it	1
was	1
because	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
looking	1
at	1
you	1
for	1
some	1
time	1
by	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
the	1
torch	1
held	1
by	1
that	1
unfortunate,	1
and	1
verily	1
your	1
worship	1
has	1
got	1
of	1
late	1
the	1
most	1
ill-favoured	1
countenance	1
I	1
ever	1
saw:	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
either	1
owing	1
to	1
the	1
fatigue	1
of	1
this	1
combat,	1
or	1
else	1
to	1
the	1
want	1
of	1
teeth	1
and	1
grinders.”	1
“It	1
is	1
not	1
that,”	1
replied	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“but	1
because	1
the	1
sage	1
whose	1
duty	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
to	1
write	1
the	1
history	1
of	1
my	1
achievements	1
must	1
have	1
thought	1
it	1
proper	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
take	1
some	1
distinctive	1
name	1
as	1
all	1
knights	1
of	1
yore	1
did;	1
one	1
being	1
‘He	1
of	1
the	1
Burning	1
Sword,’	1
another	1
‘He	1
of	1
the	1
Unicorn,’	1
this	1
one	1
‘He	1
of	1
the	1
Damsels,’	1
that	1
‘He	1
of	1
the	1
Phœnix,’	1
another	1
‘The	1
Knight	1
of	1
the	1
Griffin,’	1
and	1
another	1
‘He	1
of	1
the	1
Death,’	1
and	1
by	1
these	1
names	1
and	1
designations	1
they	1
were	1
known	1
all	1
the	1
world	1
round;	1
and	1
so	1
I	1
say	1
that	1
the	1
sage	1
aforesaid	1
must	1
have	1
put	1
it	1
into	1
your	1
mouth	1
and	1
mind	1
just	1
now	1
to	1
call	1
me	1
‘The	1
Knight	1
of	1
the	1
Rueful	1
Countenance,’	1
as	1
I	1
intend	1
to	1
call	1
myself	1
from	1
this	1
day	1
forward;	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
said	1
name	1
may	1
fit	1
me	1
better,	1
I	1
mean,	1
when	1
the	1
opportunity	1
offers,	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
very	1
rueful	1
countenance	1
painted	1
on	1
my	1
shield.”	1
“There	1
is	1
no	1
occasion,	1
señor,	1
for	1
wasting	1
time	1
or	1
money	1
on	1
making	1
that	1
countenance,”	1
said	1
Sancho;	1
“for	1
all	1
that	1
need	1
be	1
done	1
is	1
for	1
your	1
worship	1
to	1
show	1
your	1
own,	1
face	1
to	1
face,	1
to	1
those	1
who	1
look	1
at	1
you,	1
and	1
without	1
anything	1
more,	1
either	1
image	1
or	1
shield,	1
they	1
will	1
call	1
you	1
‘Him	1
of	1
the	1
Rueful	1
Countenance’	1
and	1
believe	1
me	1
I	1
am	1
telling	1
you	1
the	1
truth,	1
for	1
I	1
assure	1
you,	1
señor	1
(and	1
in	1
good	1
part	1
be	1
it	1
said),	1
hunger	1
and	1
the	1
loss	1
of	1
your	1
grinders	1
have	1
given	1
you	1
such	1
an	1
ill-favoured	1
face	1
that,	1
as	1
I	1
say,	1
the	1
rueful	1
picture	1
may	1
be	1
very	1
well	1
spared.”	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
laughed	1
at	1
Sancho’s	1
pleasantry;	1
nevertheless	1
he	1
resolved	1
to	1
call	1
himself	1
by	1
that	1
name,	1
and	1
have	1
his	1
shield	1
or	1
buckler	1
painted	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
devised.	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
would	1
have	1
looked	1
to	1
see	1
whether	1
the	1
body	1
in	1
the	1
litter	1
were	1
bones	1
or	1
not,	1
but	1
Sancho	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
it,	1
saying:	1
“Señor,	1
you	1
have	1
ended	1
this	1
perilous	1
adventure	1
more	1
safely	1
for	1
yourself	1
than	1
any	1
of	1
those	1
I	1
have	1
seen:	1
perhaps	1
these	1
people,	1
though	1
beaten	1
and	1
routed,	1
may	1
bethink	1
themselves	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
single	1
man	1
that	1
has	1
beaten	1
them,	1
and	1
feeling	1
sore	1
and	1
ashamed	1
of	1
it	1
may	1
take	1
heart	1
and	1
come	1
in	1
search	1
of	1
us	1
and	1
give	1
us	1
trouble	1
enough.	1
The	1
ass	1
is	1
in	1
proper	1
trim,	1
the	1
mountains	1
are	1
near	1
at	1
hand,	1
hunger	1
presses,	1
we	1
have	1
nothing	1
more	1
to	1
do	1
but	1
make	1
good	1
our	1
retreat,	1
and,	1
as	1
the	1
saying	1
is,	1
the	1
dead	1
to	1
the	1
grave	1
and	1
the	1
living	1
to	1
the	1
loaf.”	1
And	1
driving	1
his	1
ass	1
before	1
him	1
he	1
begged	1
his	1
master	1
to	1
follow,	1
who,	1
feeling	1
that	1
Sancho	1
was	1
right,	1
did	1
so	1
without	1
replying;	1
and	1
after	1
proceeding	1
some	1
little	1
distance	1
between	1
two	1
hills	1
they	1
found	1
themselves	1
in	1
a	1
wide	1
and	1
retired	1
valley,	1
where	1
they	1
alighted,	1
and	1
Sancho	1
unloaded	1
his	1
beast,	1
and	1
stretched	1
upon	1
the	1
green	1
grass,	1
with	1
hunger	1
for	1
sauce,	1
they	1
breakfasted,	1
dined,	1
lunched,	1
and	1
supped	1
all	1
at	1
once,	1
satisfying	1
their	1
appetites	1
with	1
more	1
than	1
one	1
store	1
of	1
cold	1
meat	1
which	1
the	1
dead	1
man’s	1
clerical	1
gentlemen	1
(who	1
seldom	1
put	1
themselves	1
on	1
short	1
allowance)	1
had	1
brought	1
with	1
them	1
on	1
their	1
sumpter	1
mule.	1
But	1
another	1
piece	1
of	1
ill-luck	1
befell	1
them,	1
which	1
Sancho	1
held	1
the	1
worst	1
of	1
all,	1
and	1
that	1
was	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
no	1
wine	1
to	1
drink,	1
nor	1
even	1
water	1
to	1
moisten	1
their	1
lips;	1
and	1
as	1
thirst	1
tormented	1
them,	1
Sancho,	1
observing	1
that	1
the	1
meadow	1
where	1
they	1
were	1
was	1
full	1
of	1
green	1
and	1
tender	1
grass,	1
said	1
what	1
will	1
be	1
told	1
in	1
the	1
following	1
chapter.	1

“It	1
cannot	1
be,	1
señor,	1
but	1
that	1
this	1
grass	1
is	1
a	1
proof	1
that	1
there	1
must	1
be	1
hard	1
by	1
some	1
spring	1
or	1
brook	1
to	1
give	1
it	1
moisture,	1
so	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
well	1
to	1
move	1
a	1
little	1
farther	1
on,	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
find	1
some	1
place	1
where	1
we	1
may	1
quench	1
this	1
terrible	1
thirst	1
that	1
plagues	1
us,	1
which	1
beyond	1
a	1
doubt	1
is	1
more	1
distressing	1
than	1
hunger.”	1
The	1
advice	1
seemed	1
good	1
to	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
and,	1
he	1
leading	1
Rocinante	1
by	1
the	1
bridle	1
and	1
Sancho	1
the	1
ass	1
by	1
the	1
halter,	1
after	1
he	1
had	1
packed	1
away	1
upon	1
him	1
the	1
remains	1
of	1
the	1
supper,	1
they	1
advanced	1
the	1
meadow	1
feeling	1
their	1
way,	1
for	1
the	1
darkness	1
of	1
the	1
night	1
made	1
it	1
impossible	1
to	1
see	1
anything;	1
but	1
they	1
had	1
not	1
gone	1
two	1
hundred	1
paces	1
when	1
a	1
loud	1
noise	1
of	1
water,	1
as	1
if	1
falling	1
from	1
great	1
rocks,	1
struck	1
their	1
ears.	1
The	1
sound	1
cheered	1
them	1
greatly;	1
but	1
halting	1
to	1
make	1
out	1
by	1
listening	1
from	1
what	1
quarter	1
it	1
came	1
they	1
heard	1
unseasonably	1
another	1
noise	1
which	1
spoiled	1
the	1
satisfaction	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
the	1
water	1
gave	1
them,	1
especially	1
for	1
Sancho,	1
who	1
was	1
by	1
nature	1
timid	1
and	1
faint-hearted.	1
They	1
heard,	1
I	1
say,	1
strokes	1
falling	1
with	1
a	1
measured	1
beat,	1
and	1
a	1
certain	1
rattling	1
of	1
iron	1
and	1
chains	1
that,	1
together	1
with	1
the	1
furious	1
din	1
of	1
the	1
water,	1
would	1
have	1
struck	1
terror	1
into	1
any	1
heart	1
but	1
Don	1
Quixote’s.	1
The	1
night	1
was,	1
as	1
has	1
been	1
said,	1
dark,	1
and	1
they	1
had	1
happened	1
to	1
reach	1
a	1
spot	1
in	1
among	1
some	1
tall	1
trees,	1
whose	1
leaves	1
stirred	1
by	1
a	1
gentle	1
breeze	1
made	1
a	1
low	1
ominous	1
sound;	1
so	1
that,	1
what	1
with	1
the	1
solitude,	1
the	1
place,	1
the	1
darkness,	1
the	1
noise	1
of	1
the	1
water,	1
and	1
the	1
rustling	1
of	1
the	1
leaves,	1
everything	1
inspired	1
awe	1
and	1
dread;	1
more	1
especially	1
as	1
they	1
perceived	1
that	1
the	1
strokes	1
did	1
not	1
cease,	1
nor	1
the	1
wind	1
lull,	1
nor	1
morning	1
approach;	1
to	1
all	1
which	1
might	1
be	1
added	1
their	1
ignorance	1
as	1
to	1
where	1
they	1
were.	1

But	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
supported	1
by	1
his	1
intrepid	1
heart,	1
leaped	1
on	1
Rocinante,	1
and	1
bracing	1
his	1
buckler	1
on	1
his	1
arm,	1
brought	1
his	1
pike	1
to	1
the	1
slope,	1
and	1
said,	1
“Friend	1
Sancho,	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
by	1
Heaven’s	1
will	1
have	1
been	1
born	1
in	1
this	1
our	1
iron	1
age	1
to	1
revive	1
in	1
it	1
the	1
age	1
of	1
gold,	1
or	1
the	1
golden	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
called;	1
I	1
am	1
he	1
for	1
whom	1
perils,	1
mighty	1
achievements,	1
and	1
valiant	1
deeds	1
are	1
reserved;	1
I	1
am,	1
I	1
say	1
again,	1
he	1
who	1
is	1
to	1
revive	1
the	1
Knights	1
of	1
the	1
Round	1
Table,	1
the	1
Twelve	1
of	1
France	1
and	1
the	1
Nine	1
Worthies;	1
and	1
he	1
who	1
is	1
to	1
consign	1
to	1
oblivion	1
the	1
Platirs,	1
the	1
Tablantes,	1
the	1
Olivantes	1
and	1
Tirantes,	1
the	1
Phœbuses	1
and	1
Belianises,	1
with	1
the	1
whole	1
herd	1
of	1
famous	1
knights-errant	1
of	1
days	1
gone	1
by,	1
performing	1
in	1
these	1
in	1
which	1
I	1
live	1
such	1
exploits,	1
marvels,	1
and	1
feats	1
of	1
arms	1
as	1
shall	1
obscure	1
their	1
brightest	1
deeds.	1
Thou	1
dost	1
mark	1
well,	1
faithful	1
and	1
trusty	1
squire,	1
the	1
gloom	1
of	1
this	1
night,	1
its	1
strange	1
silence,	1
the	1
dull	1
confused	1
murmur	1
of	1
those	1
trees,	1
the	1
awful	1
sound	1
of	1
that	1
water	1
in	1
quest	1
of	1
which	1
we	1
came,	1
that	1
seems	1
as	1
though	1
it	1
were	1
precipitating	1
and	1
dashing	1
itself	1
down	1
from	1
the	1
lofty	1
mountains	1
of	1
the	1
Moon,	1
and	1
that	1
incessant	1
hammering	1
that	1
wounds	1
and	1
pains	1
our	1
ears;	1
which	1
things	1
all	1
together	1
and	1
each	1
of	1
itself	1
are	1
enough	1
to	1
instil	1
fear,	1
dread,	1
and	1
dismay	1
into	1
the	1
breast	1
of	1
Mars	1
himself,	1
much	1
more	1
into	1
one	1
not	1
used	1
to	1
hazards	1
and	1
adventures	1
of	1
the	1
kind.	1
Well,	1
then,	1
all	1
this	1
that	1
I	1
put	1
before	1
thee	1
is	1
but	1
an	1
incentive	1
and	1
stimulant	1
to	1
my	1
spirit,	1
making	1
my	1
heart	1
burst	1
in	1
my	1
bosom	1
through	1
eagerness	1
to	1
engage	1
in	1
this	1
adventure,	1
arduous	1
as	1
it	1
promises	1
to	1
be;	1
therefore	1
tighten	1
Rocinante’s	1
girths	1
a	1
little,	1
and	1
God	1
be	1
with	1
thee;	1
wait	1
for	1
me	1
here	1
three	1
days	1
and	1
no	1
more,	1
and	1
if	1
in	1
that	1
time	1
I	1
come	1
not	1
back,	1
thou	1
canst	1
return	1
to	1
our	1
village,	1
and	1
thence,	1
to	1
do	1
me	1
a	1
favour	1
and	1
a	1
service,	1
thou	1
wilt	1
go	1
to	1
El	1
Toboso,	1
where	1
thou	1
shalt	1
say	1
to	1
my	1
incomparable	1
lady	1
Dulcinea	1
that	1
her	1
captive	1
knight	1
hath	1
died	1
in	1
attempting	1
things	1
that	1
might	1
make	1
him	1
worthy	1
of	1
being	1
called	1
hers.”	1
When	1
Sancho	1
heard	1
his	1
master’s	1
words	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
weep	1
in	1
the	1
most	1
pathetic	1
way,	1
saying:	1
“Señor,	1
I	1
know	1
not	1
why	1
your	1
worship	1
wants	1
to	1
attempt	1
this	1
so	1
dreadful	1
adventure;	1
it	1
is	1
night	1
now,	1
no	1
one	1
sees	1
us	1
here,	1
we	1
can	1
easily	1
turn	1
about	1
and	1
take	1
ourselves	1
out	1
of	1
danger,	1
even	1
if	1
we	1
don’t	1
drink	1
for	1
three	1
days	1
to	1
come;	1
and	1
as	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
one	1
to	1
see	1
us,	1
all	1
the	1
less	1
will	1
there	1
be	1
anyone	1
to	1
set	1
us	1
down	1
as	1
cowards;	1
besides,	1
I	1
have	1
many	1
a	1
time	1
heard	1
the	1
curate	1
of	1
our	1
village,	1
whom	1
your	1
worship	1
knows	1
well,	1
preach	1
that	1
he	1
who	1
seeks	1
danger	1
perishes	1
in	1
it;	1
so	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
right	1
to	1
tempt	1
God	1
by	1
trying	1
so	1
tremendous	1
a	1
feat	1
from	1
which	1
there	1
can	1
be	1
no	1
escape	1
save	1
by	1
a	1
miracle,	1
and	1
Heaven	1
has	1
performed	1
enough	1
of	1
them	1
for	1
your	1
worship	1
in	1
delivering	1
you	1
from	1
being	1
blanketed	1
as	1
I	1
was,	1
and	1
bringing	1
you	1
out	1
victorious	1
and	1
safe	1
and	1
sound	1
from	1
among	1
all	1
those	1
enemies	1
that	1
were	1
with	1
the	1
dead	1
man;	1
and	1
if	1
all	1
this	1
does	1
not	1
move	1
or	1
soften	1
that	1
hard	1
heart,	1
let	1
this	1
thought	1
and	1
reflection	1
move	1
it,	1
that	1
you	1
will	1
have	1
hardly	1
quitted	1
this	1
spot	1
when	1
from	1
pure	1
fear	1
I	1
shall	1
yield	1
my	1
soul	1
up	1
to	1
anyone	1
that	1
will	1
take	1
it.	1
I	1
left	1
home	1
and	1
wife	1
and	1
children	1
to	1
come	1
and	1
serve	1
your	1
worship,	1
trusting	1
to	1
do	1
better	1
and	1
not	1
worse;	1
but	1
as	1
covetousness	1
bursts	1
the	1
bag,	1
it	1
has	1
rent	1
my	1
hopes	1
asunder,	1
for	1
just	1
as	1
I	1
had	1
them	1
highest	1
about	1
getting	1
that	1
wretched	1
unlucky	1
island	1
your	1
worship	1
has	1
so	1
often	1
promised	1
me,	1
I	1
see	1
that	1
instead	1
and	1
in	1
lieu	1
of	1
it	1
you	1
mean	1
to	1
desert	1
me	1
now	1
in	1
a	1
place	1
so	1
far	1
from	1
human	1
reach:	1
for	1
God’s	1
sake,	1
master	1
mine,	1
deal	1
not	1
so	1
unjustly	1
by	1
me,	1
and	1
if	1
your	1
worship	1
will	1
not	1
entirely	1
give	1
up	1
attempting	1
this	1
feat,	1
at	1
least	1
put	1
it	1
off	1
till	1
morning,	1
for	1
by	1
what	1
the	1
lore	1
I	1
learned	1
when	1
I	1
was	1
a	1
shepherd	1
tells	1
me	1
it	1
cannot	1
want	1
three	1
hours	1
of	1
dawn	1
now,	1
because	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
the	1
Horn	1
is	1
overhead	1
and	1
makes	1
midnight	1
in	1
the	1
line	1
of	1
the	1
left	1
arm.”	1
“How	1
canst	1
thou	1
see,	1
Sancho,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“where	1
it	1
makes	1
that	1
line,	1
or	1
where	1
this	1
mouth	1
or	1
this	1
occiput	1
is	1
that	1
thou	1
talkest	1
of,	1
when	1
the	1
night	1
is	1
so	1
dark	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
star	1
to	1
be	1
seen	1
in	1
the	1
whole	1
heaven?”	1
“That’s	1
true,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“but	1
fear	1
has	1
sharp	1
eyes,	1
and	1
sees	1
things	1
underground,	1
much	1
more	1
above	1
in	1
heavens;	1
besides,	1
there	1
is	1
good	1
reason	1
to	1
show	1
that	1
it	1
now	1
wants	1
but	1
little	1
of	1
day.”	1
“Let	1
it	1
want	1
what	1
it	1
may,”	1
replied	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“it	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
said	1
of	1
me	1
now	1
or	1
at	1
any	1
time	1
that	1
tears	1
or	1
entreaties	1
turned	1
me	1
aside	1
from	1
doing	1
what	1
was	1
in	1
accordance	1
with	1
knightly	1
usage;	1
and	1
so	1
I	1
beg	1
of	1
thee,	1
Sancho,	1
to	1
hold	1
thy	1
peace,	1
for	1
God,	1
who	1
has	1
put	1
it	1
into	1
my	1
heart	1
to	1
undertake	1
now	1
this	1
so	1
unexampled	1
and	1
terrible	1
adventure,	1
will	1
take	1
care	1
to	1
watch	1
over	1
my	1
safety	1
and	1
console	1
thy	1
sorrow;	1
what	1
thou	1
hast	1
to	1
do	1
is	1
to	1
tighten	1
Rocinante’s	1
girths	1
well,	1
and	1
wait	1
here,	1
for	1
I	1
shall	1
come	1
back	1
shortly,	1
alive	1
or	1
dead.”	1
Sancho	1
perceiving	1
it	1
his	1
master’s	1
final	1
resolve,	1
and	1
how	1
little	1
his	1
tears,	1
counsels,	1
and	1
entreaties	1
prevailed	1
with	1
him,	1
determined	1
to	1
have	1
recourse	1
to	1
his	1
own	1
ingenuity	1
and	1
compel	1
him,	1
if	1
he	1
could,	1
to	1
wait	1
till	1
daylight;	1
and	1
so,	1
while	1
tightening	1
the	1
girths	1
of	1
the	1
horse,	1
he	1
quietly	1
and	1
without	1
being	1
felt,	1
with	1
his	1
ass’	1
halter	1
tied	1
both	1
Rocinante’s	1
legs,	1
so	1
that	1
when	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
strove	1
to	1
go	1
he	1
was	1
unable	1
as	1
the	1
horse	1
could	1
only	1
move	1
by	1
jumps.	1
Seeing	1
the	1
success	1
of	1
his	1
trick,	1
Sancho	1
Panza	1
said:	1
“See	1
there,	1
señor!	1
Heaven,	1
moved	1
by	1
my	1
tears	1
and	1
prayers,	1
has	1
so	1
ordered	1
it	1
that	1
Rocinante	1
cannot	1
stir;	1
and	1
if	1
you	1
will	1
be	1
obstinate,	1
and	1
spur	1
and	1
strike	1
him,	1
you	1
will	1
only	1
provoke	1
fortune,	1
and	1
kick,	1
as	1
they	1
say,	1
against	1
the	1
pricks.”	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
at	1
this	1
grew	1
desperate,	1
but	1
the	1
more	1
he	1
drove	1
his	1
heels	1
into	1
the	1
horse,	1
the	1
less	1
he	1
stirred	1
him;	1
and	1
not	1
having	1
any	1
suspicion	1
of	1
the	1
tying,	1
he	1
was	1
fain	1
to	1
resign	1
himself	1
and	1
wait	1
till	1
daybreak	1
or	1
until	1
Rocinante	1
could	1
move,	1
firmly	1
persuaded	1
that	1
all	1
this	1
came	1
of	1
something	1
other	1
than	1
Sancho’s	1
ingenuity.	1
So	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
him,	1
“As	1
it	1
is	1
so,	1
Sancho,	1
and	1
as	1
Rocinante	1
cannot	1
move,	1
I	1
am	1
content	1
to	1
wait	1
till	1
dawn	1
smiles	1
upon	1
us,	1
even	1
though	1
I	1
weep	1
while	1
it	1
delays	1
its	1
coming.”	1
“There	1
is	1
no	1
need	1
to	1
weep,”	1
answered	1
Sancho,	1
“for	1
I	1
will	1
amuse	1
your	1
worship	1
by	1
telling	1
stories	1
from	1
this	1
till	1
daylight,	1
unless	1
indeed	1
you	1
like	1
to	1
dismount	1
and	1
lie	1
down	1
to	1
sleep	1
a	1
little	1
on	1
the	1
green	1
grass	1
after	1
the	1
fashion	1
of	1
knights-errant,	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
be	1
fresher	1
when	1
day	1
comes	1
and	1
the	1
moment	1
arrives	1
for	1
attempting	1
this	1
extraordinary	1
adventure	1
you	1
are	1
looking	1
forward	1
to.”	1
“What	1
art	1
thou	1
talking	1
about	1
dismounting	1
or	1
sleeping	1
for?”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote.	1
“Am	1
I,	1
thinkest	1
thou,	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
knights	1
that	1
take	1
their	1
rest	1
in	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
danger?	1
Sleep	1
thou	1
who	1
art	1
born	1
to	1
sleep,	1
or	1
do	1
as	1
thou	1
wilt,	1
for	1
I	1
will	1
act	1
as	1
I	1
think	1
most	1
consistent	1
with	1
my	1
character.”	1
“Be	1
not	1
angry,	1
master	1
mine,”	1
replied	1
Sancho,	1
“I	1
did	1
not	1
mean	1
to	1
say	1
that;”	1
and	1
coming	1
close	1
to	1
him	1
he	1
laid	1
one	1
hand	1
on	1
the	1
pommel	1
of	1
the	1
saddle	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
on	1
the	1
cantle	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
held	1
his	1
master’s	1
left	1
thigh	1
in	1
his	1
embrace,	1
not	1
daring	1
to	1
separate	1
a	1
finger’s	1
width	1
from	1
him;	1
so	1
much	1
afraid	1
was	1
he	1
of	1
the	1
strokes	1
which	1
still	1
resounded	1
with	1
a	1
regular	1
beat.	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
bade	1
him	1
tell	1
some	1
story	1
to	1
amuse	1
him	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
proposed,	1
to	1
which	1
Sancho	1
replied	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
if	1
his	1
dread	1
of	1
what	1
he	1
heard	1
would	1
let	1
him;	1
“Still,”	1
said	1
he,	1
“I	1
will	1
strive	1
to	1
tell	1
a	1
story	1
which,	1
if	1
I	1
can	1
manage	1
to	1
relate	1
it,	1
and	1
nobody	1
interferes	1
with	1
the	1
telling,	1
is	1
the	1
best	1
of	1
stories,	1
and	1
let	1
your	1
worship	1
give	1
me	1
your	1
attention,	1
for	1
here	1
I	1
begin.	1
What	1
was,	1
was;	1
and	1
may	1
the	1
good	1
that	1
is	1
to	1
come	1
be	1
for	1
all,	1
and	1
the	1
evil	1
for	1
him	1
who	1
goes	1
to	1
look	1
for	1
it—your	1
worship	1
must	1
know	1
that	1
the	1
beginning	1
the	1
old	1
folk	1
used	1
to	1
put	1
to	1
their	1
tales	1
was	1
not	1
just	1
as	1
each	1
one	1
pleased;	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
maxim	1
of	1
Cato	1
Zonzorino	1
the	1
Roman,	1
that	1
says	1
‘the	1
evil	1
for	1
him	1
that	1
goes	1
to	1
look	1
for	1
it,’	1
and	1
it	1
comes	1
as	1
pat	1
to	1
the	1
purpose	1
now	1
as	1
ring	1
to	1
finger,	1
to	1
show	1
that	1
your	1
worship	1
should	1
keep	1
quiet	1
and	1
not	1
go	1
looking	1
for	1
evil	1
in	1
any	1
quarter,	1
and	1
that	1
we	1
should	1
go	1
back	1
by	1
some	1
other	1
road,	1
since	1
nobody	1
forces	1
us	1
to	1
follow	1
this	1
in	1
which	1
so	1
many	1
terrors	1
affright	1
us.”	1
“Go	1
on	1
with	1
thy	1
story,	1
Sancho,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“and	1
leave	1
the	1
choice	1
of	1
our	1
road	1
to	1
my	1
care.”	1
“I	1
say	1
then,”	1
continued	1
Sancho,	1
“that	1
in	1
a	1
village	1
of	1
Estremadura	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
goat-shepherd—that	1
is	1
to	1
say,	1
one	1
who	1
tended	1
goats—which	1
shepherd	1
or	1
goatherd,	1
as	1
my	1
story	1
goes,	1
was	1
called	1
Lope	1
Ruiz,	1
and	1
this	1
Lope	1
Ruiz	1
was	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
a	1
shepherdess	1
called	1
Torralva,	1
which	1
shepherdess	1
called	1
Torralva	1
was	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
a	1
rich	1
grazier,	1
and	1
this	1
rich	1
grazier—”	1
“If	1
that	1
is	1
the	1
way	1
thou	1
tellest	1
thy	1
tale,	1
Sancho,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“repeating	1
twice	1
all	1
thou	1
hast	1
to	1
say,	1
thou	1
wilt	1
not	1
have	1
done	1
these	1
two	1
days;	1
go	1
straight	1
on	1
with	1
it,	1
and	1
tell	1
it	1
like	1
a	1
reasonable	1
man,	1
or	1
else	1
say	1
nothing.”	1
“Tales	1
are	1
always	1
told	1
in	1
my	1
country	1
in	1
the	1
very	1
way	1
I	1
am	1
telling	1
this,”	1
answered	1
Sancho,	1
“and	1
I	1
cannot	1
tell	1
it	1
in	1
any	1
other,	1
nor	1
is	1
it	1
right	1
of	1
your	1
worship	1
to	1
ask	1
me	1
to	1
make	1
new	1
customs.”	1
“Tell	1
it	1
as	1
thou	1
wilt,”	1
replied	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
“and	1
as	1
fate	1
will	1
have	1
it	1
that	1
I	1
cannot	1
help	1
listening	1
to	1
thee,	1
go	1
on.”	1
“And	1
so,	1
lord	1
of	1
my	1
soul,”	1
continued	1
Sancho,	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
said,	1
this	1
shepherd	1
was	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
Torralva	1
the	1
shepherdess,	1
who	1
was	1
a	1
wild	1
buxom	1
lass	1
with	1
something	1
of	1
the	1
look	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
about	1
her,	1
for	1
she	1
had	1
little	1
moustaches;	1
I	1
fancy	1
I	1
see	1
her	1
now.”	1
“Then	1
you	1
knew	1
her?”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote.	1
“I	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
her,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“but	1
he	1
who	1
told	1
me	1
the	1
story	1
said	1
it	1
was	1
so	1
true	1
and	1
certain	1
that	1
when	1
I	1
told	1
it	1
to	1
another	1
I	1
might	1
safely	1
declare	1
and	1
swear	1
I	1
had	1
seen	1
it	1
all	1
myself.	1
And	1
so	1
in	1
course	1
of	1
time,	1
the	1
devil,	1
who	1
never	1
sleeps	1
and	1
puts	1
everything	1
in	1
confusion,	1
contrived	1
that	1
the	1
love	1
the	1
shepherd	1
bore	1
the	1
shepherdess	1
turned	1
into	1
hatred	1
and	1
ill-will,	1
and	1
the	1
reason,	1
according	1
to	1
evil	1
tongues,	1
was	1
some	1
little	1
jealousy	1
she	1
caused	1
him	1
that	1
crossed	1
the	1
line	1
and	1
trespassed	1
on	1
forbidden	1
ground;	1
and	1
so	1
much	1
did	1
the	1
shepherd	1
hate	1
her	1
from	1
that	1
time	1
forward	1
that,	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
escape	1
from	1
her,	1
he	1
determined	1
to	1
quit	1
the	1
country	1
and	1
go	1
where	1
he	1
should	1
never	1
set	1
eyes	1
on	1
her	1
again.	1
Torralva,	1
when	1
she	1
found	1
herself	1
spurned	1
by	1
Lope,	1
was	1
immediately	1
smitten	1
with	1
love	1
for	1
him,	1
though	1
she	1
had	1
never	1
loved	1
him	1
before.”	1
“That	1
is	1
the	1
natural	1
way	1
of	1
women,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“to	1
scorn	1
the	1
one	1
that	1
loves	1
them,	1
and	1
love	1
the	1
one	1
that	1
hates	1
them:	1
go	1
on,	1
Sancho.”	1
“It	1
came	1
to	1
pass,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“that	1
the	1
shepherd	1
carried	1
out	1
his	1
intention,	1
and	1
driving	1
his	1
goats	1
before	1
him	1
took	1
his	1
way	1
across	1
the	1
plains	1
of	1
Estremadura	1
to	1
pass	1
over	1
into	1
the	1
Kingdom	1
of	1
Portugal.	1
Torralva,	1
who	1
knew	1
of	1
it,	1
went	1
after	1
him,	1
and	1
on	1
foot	1
and	1
barefoot	1
followed	1
him	1
at	1
a	1
distance,	1
with	1
a	1
pilgrim’s	1
staff	1
in	1
her	1
hand	1
and	1
a	1
scrip	1
round	1
her	1
neck,	1
in	1
which	1
she	1
carried,	1
it	1
is	1
said,	1
a	1
bit	1
of	1
looking-glass	1
and	1
a	1
piece	1
of	1
a	1
comb	1
and	1
some	1
little	1
pot	1
or	1
other	1
of	1
paint	1
for	1
her	1
face;	1
but	1
let	1
her	1
carry	1
what	1
she	1
did,	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
going	1
to	1
trouble	1
myself	1
to	1
prove	1
it;	1
all	1
I	1
say	1
is,	1
that	1
the	1
shepherd,	1
they	1
say,	1
came	1
with	1
his	1
flock	1
to	1
cross	1
over	1
the	1
river	1
Guadiana,	1
which	1
was	1
at	1
that	1
time	1
swollen	1
and	1
almost	1
overflowing	1
its	1
banks,	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
spot	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
there	1
was	1
neither	1
ferry	1
nor	1
boat	1
nor	1
anyone	1
to	1
carry	1
him	1
or	1
his	1
flock	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
side,	1
at	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
much	1
vexed,	1
for	1
he	1
perceived	1
that	1
Torralva	1
was	1
approaching	1
and	1
would	1
give	1
him	1
great	1
annoyance	1
with	1
her	1
tears	1
and	1
entreaties;	1
however,	1
he	1
went	1
looking	1
about	1
so	1
closely	1
that	1
he	1
discovered	1
a	1
fisherman	1
who	1
had	1
alongside	1
of	1
him	1
a	1
boat	1
so	1
small	1
that	1
it	1
could	1
only	1
hold	1
one	1
person	1
and	1
one	1
goat;	1
but	1
for	1
all	1
that	1
he	1
spoke	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
agreed	1
with	1
him	1
to	1
carry	1
himself	1
and	1
his	1
three	1
hundred	1
goats	1
across.	1
The	1
fisherman	1
got	1
into	1
the	1
boat	1
and	1
carried	1
one	1
goat	1
over;	1
he	1
came	1
back	1
and	1
carried	1
another	1
over;	1
he	1
came	1
back	1
again,	1
and	1
again	1
brought	1
over	1
another—let	1
your	1
worship	1
keep	1
count	1
of	1
the	1
goats	1
the	1
fisherman	1
is	1
taking	1
across,	1
for	1
if	1
one	1
escapes	1
the	1
memory	1
there	1
will	1
be	1
an	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
story,	1
and	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
impossible	1
to	1
tell	1
another	1
word	1
of	1
it.	1
To	1
proceed,	1
I	1
must	1
tell	1
you	1
the	1
landing	1
place	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
was	1
miry	1
and	1
slippery,	1
and	1
the	1
fisherman	1
lost	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
of	1
time	1
in	1
going	1
and	1
coming;	1
still	1
he	1
returned	1
for	1
another	1
goat,	1
and	1
another,	1
and	1
another.”	1
“Take	1
it	1
for	1
granted	1
he	1
brought	1
them	1
all	1
across,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“and	1
don’t	1
keep	1
going	1
and	1
coming	1
in	1
this	1
way,	1
or	1
thou	1
wilt	1
not	1
make	1
an	1
end	1
of	1
bringing	1
them	1
over	1
this	1
twelvemonth.”	1
“How	1
many	1
have	1
gone	1
across	1
so	1
far?”	1
said	1
Sancho.	1
“How	1
the	1
devil	1
do	1
I	1
know?”	1
replied	1
Don	1
Quixote.	1
“There	1
it	1
is,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“what	1
I	1
told	1
you,	1
that	1
you	1
must	1
keep	1
a	1
good	1
count;	1
well	1
then,	1
by	1
God,	1
there	1
is	1
an	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
story,	1
for	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
going	1
any	1
farther.”	1
“How	1
can	1
that	1
be?”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
“is	1
it	1
so	1
essential	1
to	1
the	1
story	1
to	1
know	1
to	1
a	1
nicety	1
the	1
goats	1
that	1
have	1
crossed	1
over,	1
that	1
if	1
there	1
be	1
a	1
mistake	1
of	1
one	1
in	1
the	1
reckoning,	1
thou	1
canst	1
not	1
go	1
on	1
with	1
it?”	1
“No,	1
señor,	1
not	1
a	1
bit,”	1
replied	1
Sancho;	1
“for	1
when	1
I	1
asked	1
your	1
worship	1
to	1
tell	1
me	1
how	1
many	1
goats	1
had	1
crossed,	1
and	1
you	1
answered	1
you	1
did	1
not	1
know,	1
at	1
that	1
very	1
instant	1
all	1
I	1
had	1
to	1
say	1
passed	1
away	1
out	1
of	1
my	1
memory,	1
and,	1
faith,	1
there	1
was	1
much	1
virtue	1
in	1
it,	1
and	1
entertainment.”	1
“So,	1
then,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“the	1
story	1
has	1
come	1
to	1
an	1
end?”	1
“As	1
much	1
as	1
my	1
mother	1
has,”	1
said	1
Sancho.	1
“In	1
truth,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“thou	1
hast	1
told	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
rarest	1
stories,	1
tales,	1
or	1
histories,	1
that	1
anyone	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
could	1
have	1
imagined,	1
and	1
such	1
a	1
way	1
of	1
telling	1
it	1
and	1
ending	1
it	1
was	1
never	1
seen	1
nor	1
will	1
be	1
in	1
a	1
lifetime;	1
though	1
I	1
expected	1
nothing	1
else	1
from	1
thy	1
excellent	1
understanding.	1
But	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
wonder,	1
for	1
perhaps	1
those	1
ceaseless	1
strokes	1
may	1
have	1
confused	1
thy	1
wits.”	1
“All	1
that	1
may	1
be,”	1
replied	1
Sancho,	1
“but	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
as	1
to	1
my	1
story,	1
all	1
that	1
can	1
be	1
said	1
is	1
that	1
it	1
ends	1
there	1
where	1
the	1
mistake	1
in	1
the	1
count	1
of	1
the	1
passage	1
of	1
the	1
goats	1
begins.”	1
“Let	1
it	1
end	1
where	1
it	1
will,	1
well	1
and	1
good,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“and	1
let	1
us	1
see	1
if	1
Rocinante	1
can	1
go;”	1
and	1
again	1
he	1
spurred	1
him,	1
and	1
again	1
Rocinante	1
made	1
jumps	1
and	1
remained	1
where	1
he	1
was,	1
so	1
well	1
tied	1
was	1
he.	1
Just	1
then,	1
whether	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
cold	1
of	1
the	1
morning	1
that	1
was	1
now	1
approaching,	1
or	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
eaten	1
something	1
laxative	1
at	1
supper,	1
or	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
only	1
natural	1
(as	1
is	1
most	1
likely),	1
Sancho	1
felt	1
a	1
desire	1
to	1
do	1
what	1
no	1
one	1
could	1
do	1
for	1
him;	1
but	1
so	1
great	1
was	1
the	1
fear	1
that	1
had	1
penetrated	1
his	1
heart,	1
he	1
dared	1
not	1
separate	1
himself	1
from	1
his	1
master	1
by	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
the	1
black	1
of	1
his	1
nail;	1
to	1
escape	1
doing	1
what	1
he	1
wanted	1
was,	1
however,	1
also	1
impossible;	1
so	1
what	1
he	1
did	1
for	1
peace’s	1
sake	1
was	1
to	1
remove	1
his	1
right	1
hand,	1
which	1
held	1
the	1
back	1
of	1
the	1
saddle,	1
and	1
with	1
it	1
to	1
untie	1
gently	1
and	1
silently	1
the	1
running	1
string	1
which	1
alone	1
held	1
up	1
his	1
breeches,	1
so	1
that	1
on	1
loosening	1
it	1
they	1
at	1
once	1
fell	1
down	1
round	1
his	1
feet	1
like	1
fetters;	1
he	1
then	1
raised	1
his	1
shirt	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
he	1
could	1
and	1
bared	1
his	1
hind	1
quarters,	1
no	1
slim	1
ones.	1
But,	1
this	1
accomplished,	1
which	1
he	1
fancied	1
was	1
all	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
do	1
to	1
get	1
out	1
of	1
this	1
terrible	1
strait	1
and	1
embarrassment,	1
another	1
still	1
greater	1
difficulty	1
presented	1
itself,	1
for	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
impossible	1
to	1
relieve	1
himself	1
without	1
making	1
some	1
noise,	1
and	1
he	1
ground	1
his	1
teeth	1
and	1
squeezed	1
his	1
shoulders	1
together,	1
holding	1
his	1
breath	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
he	1
could;	1
but	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
his	1
precautions	1
he	1
was	1
unlucky	1
enough	1
after	1
all	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
little	1
noise,	1
very	1
different	1
from	1
that	1
which	1
was	1
causing	1
him	1
so	1
much	1
fear.	1

Don	1
Quixote,	1
hearing	1
it,	1
said,	1
“What	1
noise	1
is	1
that,	1
Sancho?”	1
“I	1
don’t	1
know,	1
señor,”	1
said	1
he;	1
“it	1
must	1
be	1
something	1
new,	1
for	1
adventures	1
and	1
misadventures	1
never	1
begin	1
with	1
a	1
trifle.”	1
Once	1
more	1
he	1
tried	1
his	1
luck,	1
and	1
succeeded	1
so	1
well,	1
that	1
without	1
any	1
further	1
noise	1
or	1
disturbance	1
he	1
found	1
himself	1
relieved	1
of	1
the	1
burden	1
that	1
had	1
given	1
him	1
so	1
much	1
discomfort.	1
But	1
as	1
Don	1
Quixote’s	1
sense	1
of	1
smell	1
was	1
as	1
acute	1
as	1
his	1
hearing,	1
and	1
as	1
Sancho	1
was	1
so	1
closely	1
linked	1
with	1
him	1
that	1
the	1
fumes	1
rose	1
almost	1
in	1
a	1
straight	1
line,	1
it	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
but	1
that	1
some	1
should	1
reach	1
his	1
nose,	1
and	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
they	1
did	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
its	1
relief	1
by	1
compressing	1
it	1
between	1
his	1
fingers,	1
saying	1
in	1
a	1
rather	1
snuffing	1
tone,	1
“Sancho,	1
it	1
strikes	1
me	1
thou	1
art	1
in	1
great	1
fear.”	1
“I	1
am,”	1
answered	1
Sancho;	1
“but	1
how	1
does	1
your	1
worship	1
perceive	1
it	1
now	1
more	1
than	1
ever?”	1
“Because	1
just	1
now	1
thou	1
smellest	1
stronger	1
than	1
ever,	1
and	1
not	1
of	1
ambergris,”	1
answered	1
Don	1
Quixote.	1
“Very	1
likely,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“but	1
that’s	1
not	1
my	1
fault,	1
but	1
your	1
worship’s,	1
for	1
leading	1
me	1
about	1
at	1
unseasonable	1
hours	1
and	1
at	1
such	1
unwonted	1
paces.”	1
“Then	1
go	1
back	1
three	1
or	1
four,	1
my	1
friend,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
all	1
the	1
time	1
with	1
his	1
fingers	1
to	1
his	1
nose;	1
“and	1
for	1
the	1
future	1
pay	1
more	1
attention	1
to	1
thy	1
person	1
and	1
to	1
what	1
thou	1
owest	1
to	1
mine;	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
my	1
great	1
familiarity	1
with	1
thee	1
that	1
has	1
bred	1
this	1
contempt.”	1
“I’ll	1
bet,”	1
replied	1
Sancho,	1
“that	1
your	1
worship	1
thinks	1
I	1
have	1
done	1
something	1
I	1
ought	1
not	1
with	1
my	1
person.”	1
“It	1
makes	1
it	1
worse	1
to	1
stir	1
it,	1
friend	1
Sancho,”	1
returned	1
Don	1
Quixote.	1
With	1
this	1
and	1
other	1
talk	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
sort	1
master	1
and	1
man	1
passed	1
the	1
night,	1
till	1
Sancho,	1
perceiving	1
that	1
daybreak	1
was	1
coming	1
on	1
apace,	1
very	1
cautiously	1
untied	1
Rocinante	1
and	1
tied	1
up	1
his	1
breeches.	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
Rocinante	1
found	1
himself	1
free,	1
though	1
by	1
nature	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
mettlesome,	1
he	1
seemed	1
to	1
feel	1
lively	1
and	1
began	1
pawing—for	1
as	1
to	1
capering,	1
begging	1
his	1
pardon,	1
he	1
knew	1
not	1
what	1
it	1
meant.	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
then,	1
observing	1
that	1
Rocinante	1
could	1
move,	1
took	1
it	1
as	1
a	1
good	1
sign	1
and	1
a	1
signal	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
attempt	1
the	1
dread	1
adventure.	1
By	1
this	1
time	1
day	1
had	1
fully	1
broken	1
and	1
everything	1
showed	1
distinctly,	1
and	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
saw	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
among	1
some	1
tall	1
trees,	1
chestnuts,	1
which	1
cast	1
a	1
very	1
deep	1
shade;	1
he	1
perceived	1
likewise	1
that	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
the	1
strokes	1
did	1
not	1
cease,	1
but	1
could	1
not	1
discover	1
what	1
caused	1
it,	1
and	1
so	1
without	1
any	1
further	1
delay	1
he	1
let	1
Rocinante	1
feel	1
the	1
spur,	1
and	1
once	1
more	1
taking	1
leave	1
of	1
Sancho,	1
he	1
told	1
him	1
to	1
wait	1
for	1
him	1
there	1
three	1
days	1
at	1
most,	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
said	1
before,	1
and	1
if	1
he	1
should	1
not	1
have	1
returned	1
by	1
that	1
time,	1
he	1
might	1
feel	1
sure	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
God’s	1
will	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
end	1
his	1
days	1
in	1
that	1
perilous	1
adventure.	1
He	1
again	1
repeated	1
the	1
message	1
and	1
commission	1
with	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
to	1
go	1
on	1
his	1
behalf	1
to	1
his	1
lady	1
Dulcinea,	1
and	1
said	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
uneasy	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
payment	1
of	1
his	1
services,	1
for	1
before	1
leaving	1
home	1
he	1
had	1
made	1
his	1
will,	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
would	1
find	1
himself	1
fully	1
recompensed	1
in	1
the	1
matter	1
of	1
wages	1
in	1
due	1
proportion	1
to	1
the	1
time	1
he	1
had	1
served;	1
but	1
if	1
God	1
delivered	1
him	1
safe,	1
sound,	1
and	1
unhurt	1
out	1
of	1
that	1
danger,	1
he	1
might	1
look	1
upon	1
the	1
promised	1
island	1
as	1
much	1
more	1
than	1
certain.	1
Sancho	1
began	1
to	1
weep	1
afresh	1
on	1
again	1
hearing	1
the	1
affecting	1
words	1
of	1
his	1
good	1
master,	1
and	1
resolved	1
to	1
stay	1
with	1
him	1
until	1
the	1
final	1
issue	1
and	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
business.	1
From	1
these	1
tears	1
and	1
this	1
honourable	1
resolve	1
of	1
Sancho	1
Panza’s	1
the	1
author	1
of	1
this	1
history	1
infers	1
that	1
he	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
of	1
good	1
birth	1
and	1
at	1
least	1
an	1
old	1
Christian;	1
and	1
the	1
feeling	1
he	1
displayed	1
touched	1
his	1
but	1
not	1
so	1
much	1
as	1
to	1
make	1
him	1
show	1
any	1
weakness;	1
on	1
the	1
contrary,	1
hiding	1
what	1
he	1
felt	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
he	1
could,	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
move	1
towards	1
that	1
quarter	1
whence	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
the	1
water	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
strokes	1
seemed	1
to	1
come.	1
Sancho	1
followed	1
him	1
on	1
foot,	1
leading	1
by	1
the	1
halter,	1
as	1
his	1
custom	1
was,	1
his	1
ass,	1
his	1
constant	1
comrade	1
in	1
prosperity	1
or	1
adversity;	1
and	1
advancing	1
some	1
distance	1
through	1
the	1
shady	1
chestnut	1
trees	1
they	1
came	1
upon	1
a	1
little	1
meadow	1
at	1
the	1
foot	1
of	1
some	1
high	1
rocks,	1
down	1
which	1
a	1
mighty	1
rush	1
of	1
water	1
flung	1
itself.	1
At	1
the	1
foot	1
of	1
the	1
rocks	1
were	1
some	1
rudely	1
constructed	1
houses	1
looking	1
more	1
like	1
ruins	1
than	1
houses,	1
from	1
among	1
which	1
came,	1
they	1
perceived,	1
the	1
din	1
and	1
clatter	1
of	1
blows,	1
which	1
still	1
continued	1
without	1
intermission.	1
Rocinante	1
took	1
fright	1
at	1
the	1
noise	1
of	1
the	1
water	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
blows,	1
but	1
quieting	1
him	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
advanced	1
step	1
by	1
step	1
towards	1
the	1
houses,	1
commending	1
himself	1
with	1
all	1
his	1
heart	1
to	1
his	1
lady,	1
imploring	1
her	1
support	1
in	1
that	1
dread	1
pass	1
and	1
enterprise,	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
way	1
commending	1
himself	1
to	1
God,	1
too,	1
not	1
to	1
forget	1
him.	1
Sancho	1
who	1
never	1
quitted	1
his	1
side,	1
stretched	1
his	1
neck	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
he	1
could	1
and	1
peered	1
between	1
the	1
legs	1
of	1
Rocinante	1
to	1
see	1
if	1
he	1
could	1
now	1
discover	1
what	1
it	1
was	1
that	1
caused	1
him	1
such	1
fear	1
and	1
apprehension.	1
They	1
went	1
it	1
might	1
be	1
a	1
hundred	1
paces	1
farther,	1
when	1
on	1
turning	1
a	1
corner	1
the	1
true	1
cause,	1
beyond	1
the	1
possibility	1
of	1
any	1
mistake,	1
of	1
that	1
dread-sounding	1
and	1
to	1
them	1
awe-inspiring	1
noise	1
that	1
had	1
kept	1
them	1
all	1
the	1
night	1
in	1
such	1
fear	1
and	1
perplexity,	1
appeared	1
plain	1
and	1
obvious;	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
(if,	1
reader,	1
thou	1
art	1
not	1
disgusted	1
and	1
disappointed)	1
six	1
fulling	1
hammers	1
which	1
by	1
their	1
alternate	1
strokes	1
made	1
all	1
the	1
din.	1
When	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
perceived	1
what	1
it	1
was,	1
he	1
was	1
struck	1
dumb	1
and	1
rigid	1
from	1
head	1
to	1
foot.	1
Sancho	1
glanced	1
at	1
him	1
and	1
saw	1
him	1
with	1
his	1
head	1
bent	1
down	1
upon	1
his	1
breast	1
in	1
manifest	1
mortification;	1
and	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
glanced	1
at	1
Sancho	1
and	1
saw	1
him	1
with	1
his	1
cheeks	1
puffed	1
out	1
and	1
his	1
mouth	1
full	1
of	1
laughter,	1
and	1
evidently	1
ready	1
to	1
explode	1
with	1
it,	1
and	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
his	1
vexation	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
laughing	1
at	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
him;	1
and	1
when	1
Sancho	1
saw	1
his	1
master	1
begin	1
he	1
let	1
go	1
so	1
heartily	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
hold	1
his	1
sides	1
with	1
both	1
hands	1
to	1
keep	1
himself	1
from	1
bursting	1
with	1
laughter.	1
Four	1
times	1
he	1
stopped,	1
and	1
as	1
many	1
times	1
did	1
his	1
laughter	1
break	1
out	1
afresh	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
violence	1
as	1
at	1
first,	1
whereat	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
grew	1
furious,	1
above	1
all	1
when	1
he	1
heard	1
him	1
say	1
mockingly,	1
“Thou	1
must	1
know,	1
friend	1
Sancho,	1
that	1
of	1
Heaven’s	1
will	1
I	1
was	1
born	1
in	1
this	1
our	1
iron	1
age	1
to	1
revive	1
in	1
it	1
the	1
golden	1
or	1
age	1
of	1
gold;	1
I	1
am	1
he	1
for	1
whom	1
are	1
reserved	1
perils,	1
mighty	1
achievements,	1
valiant	1
deeds;”	1
and	1
here	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
repeating	1
the	1
words	1
that	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
uttered	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
they	1
heard	1
the	1
awful	1
strokes.	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
then,	1
seeing	1
that	1
Sancho	1
was	1
turning	1
him	1
into	1
ridicule,	1
was	1
so	1
mortified	1
and	1
vexed	1
that	1
he	1
lifted	1
up	1
his	1
pike	1
and	1
smote	1
him	1
two	1
such	1
blows	1
that	1
if,	1
instead	1
of	1
catching	1
them	1
on	1
his	1
shoulders,	1
he	1
had	1
caught	1
them	1
on	1
his	1
head	1
there	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
no	1
wages	1
to	1
pay,	1
unless	1
indeed	1
to	1
his	1
heirs.	1
Sancho	1
seeing	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
getting	1
an	1
awkward	1
return	1
in	1
earnest	1
for	1
his	1
jest,	1
and	1
fearing	1
his	1
master	1
might	1
carry	1
it	1
still	1
further,	1
said	1
to	1
him	1
very	1
humbly,	1
“Calm	1
yourself,	1
sir,	1
for	1
by	1
God	1
I	1
am	1
only	1
joking.”	1
“Well,	1
then,	1
if	1
you	1
are	1
joking	1
I	1
am	1
not,”	1
replied	1
Don	1
Quixote.	1
“Look	1
here,	1
my	1
lively	1
gentleman,	1
if	1
these,	1
instead	1
of	1
being	1
fulling	1
hammers,	1
had	1
been	1
some	1
perilous	1
adventure,	1
have	1
I	1
not,	1
think	1
you,	1
shown	1
the	1
courage	1
required	1
for	1
the	1
attempt	1
and	1
achievement?	1
Am	1
I,	1
perchance,	1
being,	1
as	1
I	1
am,	1
a	1
gentleman,	1
bound	1
to	1
know	1
and	1
distinguish	1
sounds	1
and	1
tell	1
whether	1
they	1
come	1
from	1
fulling	1
mills	1
or	1
not;	1
and	1
that,	1
when	1
perhaps,	1
as	1
is	1
the	1
case,	1
I	1
have	1
never	1
in	1
my	1
life	1
seen	1
any	1
as	1
you	1
have,	1
low	1
boor	1
as	1
you	1
are,	1
that	1
have	1
been	1
born	1
and	1
bred	1
among	1
them?	1
But	1
turn	1
me	1
these	1
six	1
hammers	1
into	1
six	1
giants,	1
and	1
bring	1
them	1
to	1
beard	1
me,	1
one	1
by	1
one	1
or	1
all	1
together,	1
and	1
if	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
knock	1
them	1
head	1
over	1
heels,	1
then	1
make	1
what	1
mockery	1
you	1
like	1
of	1
me.”	1
“No	1
more	1
of	1
that,	1
señor,”	1
returned	1
Sancho;	1
“I	1
own	1
I	1
went	1
a	1
little	1
too	1
far	1
with	1
the	1
joke.	1
But	1
tell	1
me,	1
your	1
worship,	1
now	1
that	1
peace	1
is	1
made	1
between	1
us	1
(and	1
may	1
God	1
bring	1
you	1
out	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
adventures	1
that	1
may	1
befall	1
you	1
as	1
safe	1
and	1
sound	1
as	1
he	1
has	1
brought	1
you	1
out	1
of	1
this	1
one),	1
was	1
it	1
not	1
a	1
thing	1
to	1
laugh	1
at,	1
and	1
is	1
it	1
not	1
a	1
good	1
story,	1
the	1
great	1
fear	1
we	1
were	1
in?—at	1
least	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
in;	1
for	1
as	1
to	1
your	1
worship	1
I	1
see	1
now	1
that	1
you	1
neither	1
know	1
nor	1
understand	1
what	1
either	1
fear	1
or	1
dismay	1
is.”	1
“I	1
do	1
not	1
deny,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“that	1
what	1
happened	1
to	1
us	1
may	1
be	1
worth	1
laughing	1
at,	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
worth	1
making	1
a	1
story	1
about,	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
everyone	1
that	1
is	1
shrewd	1
enough	1
to	1
hit	1
the	1
right	1
point	1
of	1
a	1
thing.”	1
“At	1
any	1
rate,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“your	1
worship	1
knew	1
how	1
to	1
hit	1
the	1
right	1
point	1
with	1
your	1
pike,	1
aiming	1
at	1
my	1
head	1
and	1
hitting	1
me	1
on	1
the	1
shoulders,	1
thanks	1
be	1
to	1
God	1
and	1
my	1
own	1
smartness	1
in	1
dodging	1
it.	1
But	1
let	1
that	1
pass;	1
all	1
will	1
come	1
out	1
in	1
the	1
scouring;	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
heard	1
say	1
‘he	1
loves	1
thee	1
well	1
that	1
makes	1
thee	1
weep;’	1
and	1
moreover	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
way	1
with	1
great	1
lords	1
after	1
any	1
hard	1
words	1
they	1
give	1
a	1
servant	1
to	1
give	1
him	1
a	1
pair	1
of	1
breeches;	1
though	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
what	1
they	1
give	1
after	1
blows,	1
unless	1
it	1
be	1
that	1
knights-errant	1
after	1
blows	1
give	1
islands,	1
or	1
kingdoms	1
on	1
the	1
mainland.”	1
“It	1
may	1
be	1
on	1
the	1
dice,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“that	1
all	1
thou	1
sayest	1
will	1
come	1
true;	1
overlook	1
the	1
past,	1
for	1
thou	1
art	1
shrewd	1
enough	1
to	1
know	1
that	1
our	1
first	1
movements	1
are	1
not	1
in	1
our	1
own	1
control;	1
and	1
one	1
thing	1
for	1
the	1
future	1
bear	1
in	1
mind,	1
that	1
thou	1
curb	1
and	1
restrain	1
thy	1
loquacity	1
in	1
my	1
company;	1
for	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
books	1
of	1
chivalry	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
read,	1
and	1
they	1
are	1
innumerable,	1
I	1
never	1
met	1
with	1
a	1
squire	1
who	1
talked	1
so	1
much	1
to	1
his	1
lord	1
as	1
thou	1
dost	1
to	1
thine;	1
and	1
in	1
fact	1
I	1
feel	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
great	1
fault	1
of	1
thine	1
and	1
of	1
mine:	1
of	1
thine,	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
so	1
little	1
respect	1
for	1
me;	1
of	1
mine,	1
that	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
make	1
myself	1
more	1
respected.	1
There	1
was	1
Gandalin,	1
the	1
squire	1
of	1
Amadis	1
of	1
Gaul,	1
that	1
was	1
Count	1
of	1
the	1
Insula	1
Firme,	1
and	1
we	1
read	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
always	1
addressed	1
his	1
lord	1
with	1
his	1
cap	1
in	1
his	1
hand,	1
his	1
head	1
bowed	1
down	1
and	1
his	1
body	1
bent	1
double,	1
more	1
turquesco.	1
And	1
then,	1
what	1
shall	1
we	1
say	1
of	1
Gasabal,	1
the	1
squire	1
of	1
Galaor,	1
who	1
was	1
so	1
silent	1
that	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
indicate	1
to	1
us	1
the	1
greatness	1
of	1
his	1
marvellous	1
taciturnity	1
his	1
name	1
is	1
only	1
once	1
mentioned	1
in	1
the	1
whole	1
of	1
that	1
history,	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
truthful?	1
From	1
all	1
I	1
have	1
said	1
thou	1
wilt	1
gather,	1
Sancho,	1
that	1
there	1
must	1
be	1
a	1
difference	1
between	1
master	1
and	1
man,	1
between	1
lord	1
and	1
lackey,	1
between	1
knight	1
and	1
squire:	1
so	1
that	1
from	1
this	1
day	1
forward	1
in	1
our	1
intercourse	1
we	1
must	1
observe	1
more	1
respect	1
and	1
take	1
less	1
liberties,	1
for	1
in	1
whatever	1
way	1
I	1
may	1
be	1
provoked	1
with	1
you	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
bad	1
for	1
the	1
pitcher.	1
The	1
favours	1
and	1
benefits	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
promised	1
you	1
will	1
come	1
in	1
due	1
time,	1
and	1
if	1
they	1
do	1
not	1
your	1
wages	1
at	1
least	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
lost,	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
already	1
told	1
you.”	1
“All	1
that	1
your	1
worship	1
says	1
is	1
very	1
well,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“but	1
I	1
should	1
like	1
to	1
know	1
(in	1
case	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
favours	1
should	1
not	1
come,	1
and	1
it	1
might	1
be	1
necessary	1
to	1
fall	1
back	1
upon	1
wages)	1
how	1
much	1
did	1
the	1
squire	1
of	1
a	1
knight-errant	1
get	1
in	1
those	1
days,	1
and	1
did	1
they	1
agree	1
by	1
the	1
month,	1
or	1
by	1
the	1
day	1
like	1
bricklayers?”	1
“I	1
do	1
not	1
believe,”	1
replied	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“that	1
such	1
squires	1
were	1
ever	1
on	1
wages,	1
but	1
were	1
dependent	1
on	1
favour;	1
and	1
if	1
I	1
have	1
now	1
mentioned	1
thine	1
in	1
the	1
sealed	1
will	1
I	1
have	1
left	1
at	1
home,	1
it	1
was	1
with	1
a	1
view	1
to	1
what	1
may	1
happen;	1
for	1
as	1
yet	1
I	1
know	1
not	1
how	1
chivalry	1
will	1
turn	1
out	1
in	1
these	1
wretched	1
times	1
of	1
ours,	1
and	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
wish	1
my	1
soul	1
to	1
suffer	1
for	1
trifles	1
in	1
the	1
other	1
world;	1
for	1
I	1
would	1
have	1
thee	1
know,	1
Sancho,	1
that	1
in	1
this	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
condition	1
more	1
hazardous	1
than	1
that	1
of	1
adventurers.”	1
“That	1
is	1
true,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“since	1
the	1
mere	1
noise	1
of	1
the	1
hammers	1
of	1
a	1
fulling	1
mill	1
can	1
disturb	1
and	1
disquiet	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
such	1
a	1
valiant	1
errant	1
adventurer	1
as	1
your	1
worship;	1
but	1
you	1
may	1
be	1
sure	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
open	1
my	1
lips	1
henceforward	1
to	1
make	1
light	1
of	1
anything	1
of	1
your	1
worship’s,	1
but	1
only	1
to	1
honour	1
you	1
as	1
my	1
master	1
and	1
natural	1
lord.”	1
“By	1
so	1
doing,”	1
replied	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“shalt	1
thou	1
live	1
long	1
on	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
earth;	1
for	1
next	1
to	1
parents,	1
masters	1
are	1
to	1
be	1
respected	1
as	1
though	1
they	1
were	1
parents.”	1

Full	1
Size	1
It	1
now	1
began	1
to	1
rain	1
a	1
little,	1
and	1
Sancho	1
was	1
for	1
going	1
into	1
the	1
fulling	1
mills,	1
but	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
had	1
taken	1
such	1
an	1
abhorrence	1
to	1
them	1
on	1
account	1
of	1
the	1
late	1
joke	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
enter	1
them	1
on	1
any	1
account;	1
so	1
turning	1
aside	1
to	1
right	1
they	1
came	1
upon	1
another	1
road,	1
different	1
from	1
that	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
taken	1
the	1
night	1
before.	1
Shortly	1
afterwards	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
perceived	1
a	1
man	1
on	1
horseback	1
who	1
wore	1
on	1
his	1
head	1
something	1
that	1
shone	1
like	1
gold,	1
and	1
the	1
moment	1
he	1
saw	1
him	1
he	1
turned	1
to	1
Sancho	1
and	1
said:	1
“I	1
think,	1
Sancho,	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
proverb	1
that	1
is	1
not	1
true,	1
all	1
being	1
maxims	1
drawn	1
from	1
experience	1
itself,	1
the	1
mother	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
sciences,	1
especially	1
that	1
one	1
that	1
says,	1
‘Where	1
one	1
door	1
shuts,	1
another	1
opens.’	1
I	1
say	1
so	1
because	1
if	1
last	1
night	1
fortune	1
shut	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
adventure	1
we	1
were	1
looking	1
for	1
against	1
us,	1
cheating	1
us	1
with	1
the	1
fulling	1
mills,	1
it	1
now	1
opens	1
wide	1
another	1
one	1
for	1
another	1
better	1
and	1
more	1
certain	1
adventure,	1
and	1
if	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
contrive	1
to	1
enter	1
it,	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
my	1
own	1
fault,	1
and	1
I	1
cannot	1
lay	1
it	1
to	1
my	1
ignorance	1
of	1
fulling	1
mills,	1
or	1
the	1
darkness	1
of	1
the	1
night.	1
I	1
say	1
this	1
because,	1
if	1
I	1
mistake	1
not,	1
there	1
comes	1
towards	1
us	1
one	1
who	1
wears	1
on	1
his	1
head	1
the	1
helmet	1
of	1
Mambrino,	1
concerning	1
which	1
I	1
took	1
the	1
oath	1
thou	1
rememberest.”	1
“Mind	1
what	1
you	1
say,	1
your	1
worship,	1
and	1
still	1
more	1
what	1
you	1
do,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“for	1
I	1
don’t	1
want	1
any	1
more	1
fulling	1
mills	1
to	1
finish	1
off	1
fulling	1
and	1
knocking	1
our	1
senses	1
out.”	1
“The	1
devil	1
take	1
thee,	1
man,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
“what	1
has	1
a	1
helmet	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
fulling	1
mills?”	1
“I	1
don’t	1
know,”	1
replied	1
Sancho,	1
“but,	1
faith,	1
if	1
I	1
might	1
speak	1
as	1
I	1
used,	1
perhaps	1
I	1
could	1
give	1
such	1
reasons	1
that	1
your	1
worship	1
would	1
see	1
you	1
were	1
mistaken	1
in	1
what	1
you	1
say.”	1
“How	1
can	1
I	1
be	1
mistaken	1
in	1
what	1
I	1
say,	1
unbelieving	1
traitor?”	1
returned	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
“tell	1
me,	1
seest	1
thou	1
not	1
yonder	1
knight	1
coming	1
towards	1
us	1
on	1
a	1
dappled	1
grey	1
steed,	1
who	1
has	1
upon	1
his	1
head	1
a	1
helmet	1
of	1
gold?”	1
“What	1
I	1
see	1
and	1
make	1
out,”	1
answered	1
Sancho,	1
“is	1
only	1
a	1
man	1
on	1
a	1
grey	1
ass	1
like	1
my	1
own,	1
who	1
has	1
something	1
that	1
shines	1
on	1
his	1
head.”	1
“Well,	1
that	1
is	1
the	1
helmet	1
of	1
Mambrino,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
“stand	1
to	1
one	1
side	1
and	1
leave	1
me	1
alone	1
with	1
him;	1
thou	1
shalt	1
see	1
how,	1
without	1
saying	1
a	1
word,	1
to	1
save	1
time,	1
I	1
shall	1
bring	1
this	1
adventure	1
to	1
an	1
issue	1
and	1
possess	1
myself	1
of	1
the	1
helmet	1
I	1
have	1
so	1
longed	1
for.”	1
“I	1
will	1
take	1
care	1
to	1
stand	1
aside,”	1
said	1
Sancho;	1
“but	1
God	1
grant,	1
I	1
say	1
once	1
more,	1
that	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
marjoram	1
and	1
not	1
fulling	1
mills.”	1
“I	1
have	1
told	1
thee,	1
brother,	1
on	1
no	1
account	1
to	1
mention	1
those	1
fulling	1
mills	1
to	1
me	1
again,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“or	1
I	1
vow—and	1
I	1
say	1
no	1
more—I’ll	1
full	1
the	1
soul	1
out	1
of	1
you.”	1
Sancho	1
held	1
his	1
peace	1
in	1
dread	1
lest	1
his	1
master	1
should	1
carry	1
out	1
the	1
vow	1
he	1
had	1
hurled	1
like	1
a	1
bowl	1
at	1
him.	1
The	1
fact	1
of	1
the	1
matter	1
as	1
regards	1
the	1
helmet,	1
steed,	1
and	1
knight	1
that	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
saw,	1
was	1
this.	1
In	1
that	1
neighbourhood	1
there	1
were	1
two	1
villages,	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
so	1
small	1
that	1
it	1
had	1
neither	1
apothecary’s	1
shop	1
nor	1
barber,	1
which	1
the	1
other	1
that	1
was	1
close	1
to	1
it	1
had,	1
so	1
the	1
barber	1
of	1
the	1
larger	1
served	1
the	1
smaller,	1
and	1
in	1
it	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
sick	1
man	1
who	1
required	1
to	1
be	1
bled	1
and	1
another	1
man	1
who	1
wanted	1
to	1
be	1
shaved,	1
and	1
on	1
this	1
errand	1
the	1
barber	1
was	1
going,	1
carrying	1
with	1
him	1
a	1
brass	1
basin;	1
but	1
as	1
luck	1
would	1
have	1
it,	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
on	1
the	1
way	1
it	1
began	1
to	1
rain,	1
and	1
not	1
to	1
spoil	1
his	1
hat,	1
which	1
probably	1
was	1
a	1
new	1
one,	1
he	1
put	1
the	1
basin	1
on	1
his	1
head,	1
and	1
being	1
clean	1
it	1
glittered	1
at	1
half	1
a	1
league’s	1
distance.	1
He	1
rode	1
upon	1
a	1
grey	1
ass,	1
as	1
Sancho	1
said,	1
and	1
this	1
was	1
what	1
made	1
it	1
seem	1
to	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
dapple-grey	1
steed	1
and	1
a	1
knight	1
and	1
a	1
golden	1
helmet;	1
for	1
everything	1
he	1
saw	1
he	1
made	1
to	1
fall	1
in	1
with	1
his	1
crazy	1
chivalry	1
and	1
ill-errant	1
notions;	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
the	1
poor	1
knight	1
draw	1
near,	1
without	1
entering	1
into	1
any	1
parley	1
with	1
him,	1
at	1
Rocinante’s	1
top	1
speed	1
he	1
bore	1
down	1
upon	1
him	1
with	1
the	1
pike	1
pointed	1
low,	1
fully	1
determined	1
to	1
run	1
him	1
through	1
and	1
through,	1
and	1
as	1
he	1
reached	1
him,	1
without	1
checking	1
the	1
fury	1
of	1
his	1
charge,	1
he	1
cried	1
to	1
him:	1
“Defend	1
thyself,	1
miserable	1
being,	1
or	1
yield	1
me	1
of	1
thine	1
own	1
accord	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
so	1
reasonably	1
my	1
due.”	1
The	1
barber,	1
who	1
without	1
any	1
expectation	1
or	1
apprehension	1
of	1
it	1
saw	1
this	1
apparition	1
coming	1
down	1
upon	1
him,	1
had	1
no	1
other	1
way	1
of	1
saving	1
himself	1
from	1
the	1
stroke	1
of	1
the	1
lance	1
but	1
to	1
let	1
himself	1
fall	1
off	1
his	1
ass;	1
and	1
no	1
sooner	1
had	1
he	1
touched	1
the	1
ground	1
than	1
he	1
sprang	1
up	1
more	1
nimbly	1
than	1
a	1
deer	1
and	1
sped	1
away	1
across	1
the	1
plain	1
faster	1
than	1
the	1
wind.	1
He	1
left	1
the	1
basin	1
on	1
the	1
ground,	1
with	1
which	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
contented	1
himself,	1
saying	1
that	1
the	1
pagan	1
had	1
shown	1
his	1
discretion	1
and	1
imitated	1
the	1
beaver,	1
which	1
finding	1
itself	1
pressed	1
by	1
the	1
hunters	1
bites	1
and	1
cuts	1
off	1
with	1
its	1
teeth	1
that	1
for	1
which,	1
by	1
its	1
natural	1
instinct,	1
it	1
knows	1
it	1
is	1
pursued.	1
He	1
told	1
Sancho	1
to	1
pick	1
up	1
the	1
helmet,	1
and	1
he	1
taking	1
it	1
in	1
his	1
hands	1
said:	1
“By	1
God	1
the	1
basin	1
is	1
a	1
good	1
one,	1
and	1
worth	1
a	1
real	1
of	1
eight	1
if	1
it	1
is	1
worth	1
a	1
maravedis,”	1
and	1
handed	1
it	1
to	1
his	1
master,	1
who	1
immediately	1
put	1
it	1
on	1
his	1
head,	1
turning	1
it	1
round,	1
now	1
this	1
way,	1
now	1
that,	1
in	1
search	1
of	1
fitment,	1
and	1
not	1
finding	1
it	1
he	1
said,	1
“Clearly	1
the	1
pagan	1
to	1
whose	1
measure	1
this	1
famous	1
head-piece	1
was	1
first	1
forged	1
must	1
have	1
had	1
a	1
very	1
large	1
head;	1
but	1
the	1
worst	1
of	1
it	1
is	1
half	1
of	1
it	1
is	1
wanting.”	1
When	1
Sancho	1
heard	1
him	1
call	1
the	1
basin	1
a	1
headpiece	1
he	1
was	1
unable	1
to	1
restrain	1
his	1
laughter,	1
but	1
remembering	1
his	1
master’s	1
wrath	1
he	1
checked	1
himself	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
it.	1
“What	1
art	1
thou	1
laughing	1
at,	1
Sancho?”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote.	1
“I	1
am	1
laughing,”	1
said	1
he,	1
“to	1
think	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
head	1
the	1
pagan	1
must	1
have	1
had	1
who	1
owned	1
this	1
helmet,	1
for	1
it	1
looks	1
exactly	1
like	1
a	1
regular	1
barber’s	1
basin.”	1
“Dost	1
thou	1
know	1
what	1
I	1
suspect,	1
Sancho?”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
“that	1
this	1
wonderful	1
piece	1
of	1
this	1
enchanted	1
helmet	1
must	1
by	1
some	1
strange	1
accident	1
have	1
come	1
into	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
someone	1
who	1
was	1
unable	1
to	1
recognise	1
or	1
realise	1
its	1
value,	1
and	1
who,	1
not	1
knowing	1
what	1
he	1
did,	1
and	1
seeing	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
of	1
the	1
purest	1
gold,	1
must	1
have	1
melted	1
down	1
one	1
half	1
for	1
the	1
sake	1
of	1
what	1
it	1
might	1
be	1
worth,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
other	1
made	1
this	1
which	1
is	1
like	1
a	1
barber’s	1
basin	1
as	1
thou	1
sayest;	1
but	1
be	1
it	1
as	1
it	1
may,	1
to	1
me	1
who	1
recognise	1
it,	1
its	1
transformation	1
makes	1
no	1
difference,	1
for	1
I	1
will	1
set	1
it	1
to	1
rights	1
at	1
the	1
first	1
village	1
where	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
blacksmith,	1
and	1
in	1
such	1
style	1
that	1
that	1
helmet	1
the	1
god	1
of	1
smithies	1
forged	1
for	1
the	1
god	1
of	1
battles	1
shall	1
not	1
surpass	1
it	1
or	1
even	1
come	1
up	1
to	1
it;	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
meantime	1
I	1
will	1
wear	1
it	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
I	1
can,	1
for	1
something	1
is	1
better	1
than	1
nothing;	1
all	1
the	1
more	1
as	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
quite	1
enough	1
to	1
protect	1
me	1
from	1
any	1
chance	1
blow	1
of	1
a	1
stone.”	1
“That	1
is,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“if	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
shot	1
with	1
a	1
sling	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
battle	1
of	1
the	1
two	1
armies,	1
when	1
they	1
signed	1
the	1
cross	1
on	1
your	1
worship’s	1
grinders	1
and	1
smashed	1
the	1
flask	1
with	1
that	1
blessed	1
draught	1
that	1
made	1
me	1
vomit	1
my	1
bowels	1
up.”	1
“It	1
does	1
not	1
grieve	1
me	1
much	1
to	1
have	1
lost	1
it,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“for	1
thou	1
knowest,	1
Sancho,	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
the	1
receipt	1
in	1
my	1
memory.”	1
“So	1
have	1
I,”	1
answered	1
Sancho,	1
“but	1
if	1
ever	1
I	1
make	1
it,	1
or	1
try	1
it	1
again	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
I	1
live,	1
may	1
this	1
be	1
my	1
last	1
hour;	1
moreover,	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
intention	1
of	1
putting	1
myself	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
wanting	1
it,	1
for	1
I	1
mean,	1
with	1
all	1
my	1
five	1
senses,	1
to	1
keep	1
myself	1
from	1
being	1
wounded	1
or	1
from	1
wounding	1
anyone:	1
as	1
to	1
being	1
blanketed	1
again	1
I	1
say	1
nothing,	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
hard	1
to	1
prevent	1
mishaps	1
of	1
that	1
sort,	1
and	1
if	1
they	1
come	1
there	1
is	1
nothing	1
for	1
it	1
but	1
to	1
squeeze	1
our	1
shoulders	1
together,	1
hold	1
our	1
breath,	1
shut	1
our	1
eyes,	1
and	1
let	1
ourselves	1
go	1
where	1
luck	1
and	1
the	1
blanket	1
may	1
send	1
us.”	1
“Thou	1
art	1
a	1
bad	1
Christian,	1
Sancho,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
on	1
hearing	1
this,	1
“for	1
once	1
an	1
injury	1
has	1
been	1
done	1
thee	1
thou	1
never	1
forgettest	1
it:	1
but	1
know	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
part	1
of	1
noble	1
and	1
generous	1
hearts	1
not	1
to	1
attach	1
importance	1
to	1
trifles.	1
What	1
lame	1
leg	1
hast	1
thou	1
got	1
by	1
it,	1
what	1
broken	1
rib,	1
what	1
cracked	1
head,	1
that	1
thou	1
canst	1
not	1
forget	1
that	1
jest?	1
For	1
jest	1
and	1
sport	1
it	1
was,	1
properly	1
regarded,	1
and	1
had	1
I	1
not	1
seen	1
it	1
in	1
that	1
light	1
I	1
would	1
have	1
returned	1
and	1
done	1
more	1
mischief	1
in	1
revenging	1
thee	1
than	1
the	1
Greeks	1
did	1
for	1
the	1
rape	1
of	1
Helen,	1
who,	1
if	1
she	1
were	1
alive	1
now,	1
or	1
if	1
my	1
Dulcinea	1
had	1
lived	1
then,	1
might	1
depend	1
upon	1
it	1
she	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
so	1
famous	1
for	1
her	1
beauty	1
as	1
she	1
is;”	1
and	1
here	1
he	1
heaved	1
a	1
sigh	1
and	1
sent	1
it	1
aloft;	1
and	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“Let	1
it	1
pass	1
for	1
a	1
jest	1
as	1
it	1
cannot	1
be	1
revenged	1
in	1
earnest,	1
but	1
I	1
know	1
what	1
sort	1
of	1
jest	1
and	1
earnest	1
it	1
was,	1
and	1
I	1
know	1
it	1
will	1
never	1
be	1
rubbed	1
out	1
of	1
my	1
memory	1
any	1
more	1
than	1
off	1
my	1
shoulders.	1
But	1
putting	1
that	1
aside,	1
will	1
your	1
worship	1
tell	1
me	1
what	1
are	1
we	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
this	1
dapple-grey	1
steed	1
that	1
looks	1
like	1
a	1
grey	1
ass,	1
which	1
that	1
Martino	1
that	1
your	1
worship	1
overthrew	1
has	1
left	1
deserted	1
here?	1
for,	1
from	1
the	1
way	1
he	1
took	1
to	1
his	1
heels	1
and	1
bolted,	1
he	1
is	1
not	1
likely	1
ever	1
to	1
come	1
back	1
for	1
it;	1
and	1
by	1
my	1
beard	1
but	1
the	1
grey	1
is	1
a	1
good	1
one.”	1
“I	1
have	1
never	1
been	1
in	1
the	1
habit,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“of	1
taking	1
spoil	1
of	1
those	1
whom	1
I	1
vanquish,	1
nor	1
is	1
it	1
the	1
practice	1
of	1
chivalry	1
to	1
take	1
away	1
their	1
horses	1
and	1
leave	1
them	1
to	1
go	1
on	1
foot,	1
unless	1
indeed	1
it	1
be	1
that	1
the	1
victor	1
have	1
lost	1
his	1
own	1
in	1
the	1
combat,	1
in	1
which	1
case	1
it	1
is	1
lawful	1
to	1
take	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
vanquished	1
as	1
a	1
thing	1
won	1
in	1
lawful	1
war;	1
therefore,	1
Sancho,	1
leave	1
this	1
horse,	1
or	1
ass,	1
or	1
whatever	1
thou	1
wilt	1
have	1
it	1
to	1
be;	1
for	1
when	1
its	1
owner	1
sees	1
us	1
gone	1
hence	1
he	1
will	1
come	1
back	1
for	1
it.”	1
“God	1
knows	1
I	1
should	1
like	1
to	1
take	1
it,”	1
returned	1
Sancho,	1
“or	1
at	1
least	1
to	1
change	1
it	1
for	1
my	1
own,	1
which	1
does	1
not	1
seem	1
to	1
me	1
as	1
good	1
a	1
one:	1
verily	1
the	1
laws	1
of	1
chivalry	1
are	1
strict,	1
since	1
they	1
cannot	1
be	1
stretched	1
to	1
let	1
one	1
ass	1
be	1
changed	1
for	1
another;	1
I	1
should	1
like	1
to	1
know	1
if	1
I	1
might	1
at	1
least	1
change	1
trappings.”	1
“On	1
that	1
head	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
quite	1
certain,”	1
answered	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“and	1
the	1
matter	1
being	1
doubtful,	1
pending	1
better	1
information,	1
I	1
say	1
thou	1
mayest	1
change	1
them,	1
if	1
so	1
be	1
thou	1
hast	1
urgent	1
need	1
of	1
them.”	1
“So	1
urgent	1
is	1
it,”	1
answered	1
Sancho,	1
“that	1
if	1
they	1
were	1
for	1
my	1
own	1
person	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
want	1
them	1
more;”	1
and	1
forthwith,	1
fortified	1
by	1
this	1
licence,	1
he	1
effected	1
the	1
_mutatio	1
capparum_,	1
and	1
rigged	1
out	1
his	1
beast	1
to	1
the	1
ninety-nines	1
and	1
making	1
quite	1
another	1
thing	1
of	1
it.	1
This	1
done,	1
they	1
broke	1
their	1
fast	1
on	1
the	1
remains	1
of	1
the	1
spoils	1
of	1
war	1
plundered	1
from	1
the	1
sumpter	1
mule,	1
and	1
drank	1
of	1
the	1
brook	1
that	1
flowed	1
from	1
the	1
fulling	1
mills,	1
without	1
casting	1
a	1
look	1
in	1
that	1
direction,	1
in	1
such	1
loathing	1
did	1
they	1
hold	1
them	1
for	1
the	1
alarm	1
they	1
had	1
caused	1
them;	1
and,	1
all	1
anger	1
and	1
gloom	1
removed,	1
they	1
mounted	1
and,	1
without	1
taking	1
any	1
fixed	1
road	1
(not	1
to	1
fix	1
upon	1
any	1
being	1
the	1
proper	1
thing	1
for	1
true	1
knights-errant),	1
they	1
set	1
out,	1
guided	1
by	1
Rocinante’s	1
will,	1
which	1
carried	1
along	1
with	1
it	1
that	1
of	1
his	1
master,	1
not	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
ass,	1
which	1
always	1
followed	1
him	1
wherever	1
he	1
led,	1
lovingly	1
and	1
sociably;	1
nevertheless	1
they	1
returned	1
to	1
the	1
high	1
road,	1
and	1
pursued	1
it	1
at	1
a	1
venture	1
without	1
any	1
other	1
aim.	1
As	1
they	1
went	1
along,	1
then,	1
in	1
this	1
way	1
Sancho	1
said	1
to	1
his	1
master,	1
“Señor,	1
would	1
your	1
worship	1
give	1
me	1
leave	1
to	1
speak	1
a	1
little	1
to	1
you?	1
For	1
since	1
you	1
laid	1
that	1
hard	1
injunction	1
of	1
silence	1
on	1
me	1
several	1
things	1
have	1
gone	1
to	1
rot	1
in	1
my	1
stomach,	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
now	1
just	1
one	1
on	1
the	1
tip	1
of	1
my	1
tongue	1
that	1
I	1
don’t	1
want	1
to	1
be	1
spoiled.”	1
“Say,	1
on,	1
Sancho,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“and	1
be	1
brief	1
in	1
thy	1
discourse,	1
for	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
pleasure	1
in	1
one	1
that	1
is	1
long.”	1
“Well	1
then,	1
señor,”	1
returned	1
Sancho,	1
“I	1
say	1
that	1
for	1
some	1
days	1
past	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
considering	1
how	1
little	1
is	1
got	1
or	1
gained	1
by	1
going	1
in	1
search	1
of	1
these	1
adventures	1
that	1
your	1
worship	1
seeks	1
in	1
these	1
wilds	1
and	1
cross-roads,	1
where,	1
even	1
if	1
the	1
most	1
perilous	1
are	1
victoriously	1
achieved,	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
one	1
to	1
see	1
or	1
know	1
of	1
them,	1
and	1
so	1
they	1
must	1
be	1
left	1
untold	1
for	1
ever,	1
to	1
the	1
loss	1
of	1
your	1
worship’s	1
object	1
and	1
the	1
credit	1
they	1
deserve;	1
therefore	1
it	1
seems	1
to	1
me	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
better	1
(saving	1
your	1
worship’s	1
better	1
judgment)	1
if	1
we	1
were	1
to	1
go	1
and	1
serve	1
some	1
emperor	1
or	1
other	1
great	1
prince	1
who	1
may	1
have	1
some	1
war	1
on	1
hand,	1
in	1
whose	1
service	1
your	1
worship	1
may	1
prove	1
the	1
worth	1
of	1
your	1
person,	1
your	1
great	1
might,	1
and	1
greater	1
understanding,	1
on	1
perceiving	1
which	1
the	1
lord	1
in	1
whose	1
service	1
we	1
may	1
be	1
will	1
perforce	1
have	1
to	1
reward	1
us,	1
each	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
merits;	1
and	1
there	1
you	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
at	1
a	1
loss	1
for	1
someone	1
to	1
set	1
down	1
your	1
achievements	1
in	1
writing	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
preserve	1
their	1
memory	1
for	1
ever.	1
Of	1
my	1
own	1
I	1
say	1
nothing,	1
as	1
they	1
will	1
not	1
go	1
beyond	1
squirely	1
limits,	1
though	1
I	1
make	1
bold	1
to	1
say	1
that,	1
if	1
it	1
be	1
the	1
practice	1
in	1
chivalry	1
to	1
write	1
the	1
achievements	1
of	1
squires,	1
I	1
think	1
mine	1
must	1
not	1
be	1
left	1
out.”	1
“Thou	1
speakest	1
not	1
amiss,	1
Sancho,”	1
answered	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“but	1
before	1
that	1
point	1
is	1
reached	1
it	1
is	1
requisite	1
to	1
roam	1
the	1
world,	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
on	1
probation,	1
seeking	1
adventures,	1
in	1
order	1
that,	1
by	1
achieving	1
some,	1
name	1
and	1
fame	1
may	1
be	1
acquired,	1
such	1
that	1
when	1
he	1
betakes	1
himself	1
to	1
the	1
court	1
of	1
some	1
great	1
monarch	1
the	1
knight	1
may	1
be	1
already	1
known	1
by	1
his	1
deeds,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
boys,	1
the	1
instant	1
they	1
see	1
him	1
enter	1
the	1
gate	1
of	1
the	1
city,	1
may	1
all	1
follow	1
him	1
and	1
surround	1
him,	1
crying,	1
‘This	1
is	1
the	1
Knight	1
of	1
the	1
Sun’—or	1
the	1
Serpent,	1
or	1
any	1
other	1
title	1
under	1
which	1
he	1
may	1
have	1
achieved	1
great	1
deeds.	1
‘This,’	1
they	1
will	1
say,	1
‘is	1
he	1
who	1
vanquished	1
in	1
single	1
combat	1
the	1
gigantic	1
Brocabruno	1
of	1
mighty	1
strength;	1
he	1
who	1
delivered	1
the	1
great	1
Mameluke	1
of	1
Persia	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
long	1
enchantment	1
under	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
for	1
almost	1
nine	1
hundred	1
years.’	1
So	1
from	1
one	1
to	1
another	1
they	1
will	1
go	1
proclaiming	1
his	1
achievements;	1
and	1
presently	1
at	1
the	1
tumult	1
of	1
the	1
boys	1
and	1
the	1
others	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
that	1
kingdom	1
will	1
appear	1
at	1
the	1
windows	1
of	1
his	1
royal	1
palace,	1
and	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
beholds	1
the	1
knight,	1
recognising	1
him	1
by	1
his	1
arms	1
and	1
the	1
device	1
on	1
his	1
shield,	1
he	1
will	1
as	1
a	1
matter	1
of	1
course	1
say,	1
‘What	1
ho!	1
Forth	1
all	1
ye,	1
the	1
knights	1
of	1
my	1
court,	1
to	1
receive	1
the	1
flower	1
of	1
chivalry	1
who	1
cometh	1
hither!’	1
At	1
which	1
command	1
all	1
will	1
issue	1
forth,	1
and	1
he	1
himself,	1
advancing	1
half-way	1
down	1
the	1
stairs,	1
will	1
embrace	1
him	1
closely,	1
and	1
salute	1
him,	1
kissing	1
him	1
on	1
the	1
cheek,	1
and	1
will	1
then	1
lead	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
queen’s	1
chamber,	1
where	1
the	1
knight	1
will	1
find	1
her	1
with	1
the	1
princess	1
her	1
daughter,	1
who	1
will	1
be	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
beautiful	1
and	1
accomplished	1
damsels	1
that	1
could	1
with	1
the	1
utmost	1
pains	1
be	1
discovered	1
anywhere	1
in	1
the	1
known	1
world.	1
Straightway	1
it	1
will	1
come	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
she	1
will	1
fix	1
her	1
eyes	1
upon	1
the	1
knight	1
and	1
he	1
his	1
upon	1
her,	1
and	1
each	1
will	1
seem	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
something	1
more	1
divine	1
than	1
human,	1
and,	1
without	1
knowing	1
how	1
or	1
why	1
they	1
will	1
be	1
taken	1
and	1
entangled	1
in	1
the	1
inextricable	1
toils	1
of	1
love,	1
and	1
sorely	1
distressed	1
in	1
their	1
hearts	1
not	1
to	1
see	1
any	1
way	1
of	1
making	1
their	1
pains	1
and	1
sufferings	1
known	1
by	1
speech.	1
Thence	1
they	1
will	1
lead	1
him,	1
no	1
doubt,	1
to	1
some	1
richly	1
adorned	1
chamber	1
of	1
the	1
palace,	1
where,	1
having	1
removed	1
his	1
armour,	1
they	1
will	1
bring	1
him	1
a	1
rich	1
mantle	1
of	1
scarlet	1
wherewith	1
to	1
robe	1
himself,	1
and	1
if	1
he	1
looked	1
noble	1
in	1
his	1
armour	1
he	1
will	1
look	1
still	1
more	1
so	1
in	1
a	1
doublet.	1
When	1
night	1
comes	1
he	1
will	1
sup	1
with	1
the	1
king,	1
queen,	1
and	1
princess;	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
time	1
he	1
will	1
never	1
take	1
his	1
eyes	1
off	1
her,	1
stealing	1
stealthy	1
glances,	1
unnoticed	1
by	1
those	1
present,	1
and	1
she	1
will	1
do	1
the	1
same,	1
and	1
with	1
equal	1
cautiousness,	1
being,	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
said,	1
a	1
damsel	1
of	1
great	1
discretion.	1
The	1
tables	1
being	1
removed,	1
suddenly	1
through	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
hall	1
there	1
will	1
enter	1
a	1
hideous	1
and	1
diminutive	1
dwarf	1
followed	1
by	1
a	1
fair	1
dame,	1
between	1
two	1
giants,	1
who	1
comes	1
with	1
a	1
certain	1
adventure,	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
an	1
ancient	1
sage;	1
and	1
he	1
who	1
shall	1
achieve	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
deemed	1
the	1
best	1
knight	1
in	1
the	1
world.	1
“The	1
king	1
will	1
then	1
command	1
all	1
those	1
present	1
to	1
essay	1
it,	1
and	1
none	1
will	1
bring	1
it	1
to	1
an	1
end	1
and	1
conclusion	1
save	1
the	1
stranger	1
knight,	1
to	1
the	1
great	1
enhancement	1
of	1
his	1
fame,	1
whereat	1
the	1
princess	1
will	1
be	1
overjoyed	1
and	1
will	1
esteem	1
herself	1
happy	1
and	1
fortunate	1
in	1
having	1
fixed	1
and	1
placed	1
her	1
thoughts	1
so	1
high.	1
And	1
the	1
best	1
of	1
it	1
is	1
that	1
this	1
king,	1
or	1
prince,	1
or	1
whatever	1
he	1
is,	1
is	1
engaged	1
in	1
a	1
very	1
bitter	1
war	1
with	1
another	1
as	1
powerful	1
as	1
himself,	1
and	1
the	1
stranger	1
knight,	1
after	1
having	1
been	1
some	1
days	1
at	1
his	1
court,	1
requests	1
leave	1
from	1
him	1
to	1
go	1
and	1
serve	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
said	1
war.	1
The	1
king	1
will	1
grant	1
it	1
very	1
readily,	1
and	1
the	1
knight	1
will	1
courteously	1
kiss	1
his	1
hands	1
for	1
the	1
favour	1
done	1
to	1
him;	1
and	1
that	1
night	1
he	1
will	1
take	1
leave	1
of	1
his	1
lady	1
the	1
princess	1
at	1
the	1
grating	1
of	1
the	1
chamber	1
where	1
she	1
sleeps,	1
which	1
looks	1
upon	1
a	1
garden,	1
and	1
at	1
which	1
he	1
has	1
already	1
many	1
times	1
conversed	1
with	1
her,	1
the	1
go-between	1
and	1
confidante	1
in	1
the	1
matter	1
being	1
a	1
damsel	1
much	1
trusted	1
by	1
the	1
princess.	1
He	1
will	1
sigh,	1
she	1
will	1
swoon,	1
the	1
damsel	1
will	1
fetch	1
water,	1
much	1
distressed	1
because	1
morning	1
approaches,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
honour	1
of	1
her	1
lady	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
discovered;	1
at	1
last	1
the	1
princess	1
will	1
come	1
to	1
herself	1
and	1
will	1
present	1
her	1
white	1
hands	1
through	1
the	1
grating	1
to	1
the	1
knight,	1
who	1
will	1
kiss	1
them	1
a	1
thousand	1
and	1
a	1
thousand	1
times,	1
bathing	1
them	1
with	1
his	1
tears.	1
It	1
will	1
be	1
arranged	1
between	1
them	1
how	1
they	1
are	1
to	1
inform	1
each	1
other	1
of	1
their	1
good	1
or	1
evil	1
fortunes,	1
and	1
the	1
princess	1
will	1
entreat	1
him	1
to	1
make	1
his	1
absence	1
as	1
short	1
as	1
possible,	1
which	1
he	1
will	1
promise	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
many	1
oaths;	1
once	1
more	1
he	1
kisses	1
her	1
hands,	1
and	1
takes	1
his	1
leave	1
in	1
such	1
grief	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
well-nigh	1
ready	1
to	1
die.	1
He	1
betakes	1
him	1
thence	1
to	1
his	1
chamber,	1
flings	1
himself	1
on	1
his	1
bed,	1
cannot	1
sleep	1
for	1
sorrow	1
at	1
parting,	1
rises	1
early	1
in	1
the	1
morning,	1
goes	1
to	1
take	1
leave	1
of	1
the	1
king,	1
queen,	1
and	1
princess,	1
and,	1
as	1
he	1
takes	1
his	1
leave	1
of	1
the	1
pair,	1
it	1
is	1
told	1
him	1
that	1
the	1
princess	1
is	1
indisposed	1
and	1
cannot	1
receive	1
a	1
visit;	1
the	1
knight	1
thinks	1
it	1
is	1
from	1
grief	1
at	1
his	1
departure,	1
his	1
heart	1
is	1
pierced,	1
and	1
he	1
is	1
hardly	1
able	1
to	1
keep	1
from	1
showing	1
his	1
pain.	1
The	1
confidante	1
is	1
present,	1
observes	1
all,	1
goes	1
to	1
tell	1
her	1
mistress,	1
who	1
listens	1
with	1
tears	1
and	1
says	1
that	1
one	1
of	1
her	1
greatest	1
distresses	1
is	1
not	1
knowing	1
who	1
this	1
knight	1
is,	1
and	1
whether	1
he	1
is	1
of	1
kingly	1
lineage	1
or	1
not;	1
the	1
damsel	1
assures	1
her	1
that	1
so	1
much	1
courtesy,	1
gentleness,	1
and	1
gallantry	1
of	1
bearing	1
as	1
her	1
knight	1
possesses	1
could	1
not	1
exist	1
in	1
any	1
save	1
one	1
who	1
was	1
royal	1
and	1
illustrious;	1
her	1
anxiety	1
is	1
thus	1
relieved,	1
and	1
she	1
strives	1
to	1
be	1
of	1
good	1
cheer	1
lest	1
she	1
should	1
excite	1
suspicion	1
in	1
her	1
parents,	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
two	1
days	1
she	1
appears	1
in	1
public.	1
Meanwhile	1
the	1
knight	1
has	1
taken	1
his	1
departure;	1
he	1
fights	1
in	1
the	1
war,	1
conquers	1
the	1
king’s	1
enemy,	1
wins	1
many	1
cities,	1
triumphs	1
in	1
many	1
battles,	1
returns	1
to	1
the	1
court,	1
sees	1
his	1
lady	1
where	1
he	1
was	1
wont	1
to	1
see	1
her,	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
agreed	1
that	1
he	1
shall	1
demand	1
her	1
in	1
marriage	1
of	1
her	1
parents	1
as	1
the	1
reward	1
of	1
his	1
services;	1
the	1
king	1
is	1
unwilling	1
to	1
give	1
her,	1
as	1
he	1
knows	1
not	1
who	1
he	1
is,	1
but	1
nevertheless,	1
whether	1
carried	1
off	1
or	1
in	1
whatever	1
other	1
way	1
it	1
may	1
be,	1
the	1
princess	1
comes	1
to	1
be	1
his	1
bride,	1
and	1
her	1
father	1
comes	1
to	1
regard	1
it	1
as	1
very	1
good	1
fortune;	1
for	1
it	1
so	1
happens	1
that	1
this	1
knight	1
is	1
proved	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
a	1
valiant	1
king	1
of	1
some	1
kingdom,	1
I	1
know	1
not	1
what,	1
for	1
I	1
fancy	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
likely	1
to	1
be	1
on	1
the	1
map.	1
The	1
father	1
dies,	1
the	1
princess	1
inherits,	1
and	1
in	1
two	1
words	1
the	1
knight	1
becomes	1
king.	1
And	1
here	1
comes	1
in	1
at	1
once	1
the	1
bestowal	1
of	1
rewards	1
upon	1
his	1
squire	1
and	1
all	1
who	1
have	1
aided	1
him	1
in	1
rising	1
to	1
so	1
exalted	1
a	1
rank.	1
He	1
marries	1
his	1
squire	1
to	1
a	1
damsel	1
of	1
the	1
princess’s,	1
who	1
will	1
be,	1
no	1
doubt,	1
the	1
one	1
who	1
was	1
confidante	1
in	1
their	1
amour,	1
and	1
is	1
daughter	1
of	1
a	1
very	1
great	1
duke.”	1
“That’s	1
what	1
I	1
want,	1
and	1
no	1
mistake	1
about	1
it!”	1
said	1
Sancho.	1
“That’s	1
what	1
I’m	1
waiting	1
for;	1
for	1
all	1
this,	1
word	1
for	1
word,	1
is	1
in	1
store	1
for	1
your	1
worship	1
under	1
the	1
title	1
of	1
the	1
Knight	1
of	1
the	1
Rueful	1
Countenance.”	1
“Thou	1
needst	1
not	1
doubt	1
it,	1
Sancho,”	1
replied	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“for	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
manner,	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
same	1
steps	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
described	1
here,	1
knights-errant	1
rise	1
and	1
have	1
risen	1
to	1
be	1
kings	1
and	1
emperors;	1
all	1
we	1
want	1
now	1
is	1
to	1
find	1
out	1
what	1
king,	1
Christian	1
or	1
pagan,	1
is	1
at	1
war	1
and	1
has	1
a	1
beautiful	1
daughter;	1
but	1
there	1
will	1
be	1
time	1
enough	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
that,	1
for,	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
told	1
thee,	1
fame	1
must	1
be	1
won	1
in	1
other	1
quarters	1
before	1
repairing	1
to	1
the	1
court.	1
There	1
is	1
another	1
thing,	1
too,	1
that	1
is	1
wanting;	1
for	1
supposing	1
we	1
find	1
a	1
king	1
who	1
is	1
at	1
war	1
and	1
has	1
a	1
beautiful	1
daughter,	1
and	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
won	1
incredible	1
fame	1
throughout	1
the	1
universe,	1
I	1
know	1
not	1
how	1
it	1
can	1
be	1
made	1
out	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
of	1
royal	1
lineage,	1
or	1
even	1
second	1
cousin	1
to	1
an	1
emperor;	1
for	1
the	1
king	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
willing	1
to	1
give	1
me	1
his	1
daughter	1
in	1
marriage	1
unless	1
he	1
is	1
first	1
thoroughly	1
satisfied	1
on	1
this	1
point,	1
however	1
much	1
my	1
famous	1
deeds	1
may	1
deserve	1
it;	1
so	1
that	1
by	1
this	1
deficiency	1
I	1
fear	1
I	1
shall	1
lose	1
what	1
my	1
arm	1
has	1
fairly	1
earned.	1
True	1
it	1
is	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
gentleman	1
of	1
known	1
house,	1
of	1
estate	1
and	1
property,	1
and	1
entitled	1
to	1
the	1
five	1
hundred	1
sueldos	1
mulet;	1
and	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
that	1
the	1
sage	1
who	1
shall	1
write	1
my	1
history	1
will	1
so	1
clear	1
up	1
my	1
ancestry	1
and	1
pedigree	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
find	1
myself	1
fifth	1
or	1
sixth	1
in	1
descent	1
from	1
a	1
king;	1
for	1
I	1
would	1
have	1
thee	1
know,	1
Sancho,	1
that	1
there	1
are	1
two	1
kinds	1
of	1
lineages	1
in	1
the	1
world;	1
some	1
there	1
be	1
tracing	1
and	1
deriving	1
their	1
descent	1
from	1
kings	1
and	1
princes,	1
whom	1
time	1
has	1
reduced	1
little	1
by	1
little	1
until	1
they	1
end	1
in	1
a	1
point	1
like	1
a	1
pyramid	1
upside	1
down;	1
and	1
others	1
who	1
spring	1
from	1
the	1
common	1
herd	1
and	1
go	1
on	1
rising	1
step	1
by	1
step	1
until	1
they	1
come	1
to	1
be	1
great	1
lords;	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
difference	1
is	1
that	1
the	1
one	1
were	1
what	1
they	1
no	1
longer	1
are,	1
and	1
the	1
others	1
are	1
what	1
they	1
formerly	1
were	1
not.	1
And	1
I	1
may	1
be	1
of	1
such	1
that	1
after	1
investigation	1
my	1
origin	1
may	1
prove	1
great	1
and	1
famous,	1
with	1
which	1
the	1
king,	1
my	1
father-in-law	1
that	1
is	1
to	1
be,	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
satisfied;	1
and	1
should	1
he	1
not	1
be,	1
the	1
princess	1
will	1
so	1
love	1
me	1
that	1
even	1
though	1
she	1
well	1
knew	1
me	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
a	1
water-carrier,	1
she	1
will	1
take	1
me	1
for	1
her	1
lord	1
and	1
husband	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
her	1
father;	1
if	1
not,	1
then	1
it	1
comes	1
to	1
seizing	1
her	1
and	1
carrying	1
her	1
off	1
where	1
I	1
please;	1
for	1
time	1
or	1
death	1
will	1
put	1
an	1
end	1
to	1
the	1
wrath	1
of	1
her	1
parents.”	1
“It	1
comes	1
to	1
this,	1
too,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“what	1
some	1
naughty	1
people	1
say,	1
‘Never	1
ask	1
as	1
a	1
favour	1
what	1
thou	1
canst	1
take	1
by	1
force;’	1
though	1
it	1
would	1
fit	1
better	1
to	1
say,	1
‘A	1
clear	1
escape	1
is	1
better	1
than	1
good	1
men’s	1
prayers.’	1
I	1
say	1
so	1
because	1
if	1
my	1
lord	1
the	1
king,	1
your	1
worship’s	1
father-in-law,	1
will	1
not	1
condescend	1
to	1
give	1
you	1
my	1
lady	1
the	1
princess,	1
there	1
is	1
nothing	1
for	1
it	1
but,	1
as	1
your	1
worship	1
says,	1
to	1
seize	1
her	1
and	1
transport	1
her.	1
But	1
the	1
mischief	1
is	1
that	1
until	1
peace	1
is	1
made	1
and	1
you	1
come	1
into	1
the	1
peaceful	1
enjoyment	1
of	1
your	1
kingdom,	1
the	1
poor	1
squire	1
is	1
famishing	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
rewards	1
go,	1
unless	1
it	1
be	1
that	1
the	1
confidante	1
damsel	1
that	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
his	1
wife	1
comes	1
with	1
the	1
princess,	1
and	1
that	1
with	1
her	1
he	1
tides	1
over	1
his	1
bad	1
luck	1
until	1
Heaven	1
otherwise	1
orders	1
things;	1
for	1
his	1
master,	1
I	1
suppose,	1
may	1
as	1
well	1
give	1
her	1
to	1
him	1
at	1
once	1
for	1
a	1
lawful	1
wife.”	1
“Nobody	1
can	1
object	1
to	1
that,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote.	1
“Then	1
since	1
that	1
may	1
be,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“there	1
is	1
nothing	1
for	1
it	1
but	1
to	1
commend	1
ourselves	1
to	1
God,	1
and	1
let	1
fortune	1
take	1
what	1
course	1
it	1
will.”	1
“God	1
guide	1
it	1
according	1
to	1
my	1
wishes	1
and	1
thy	1
wants,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“and	1
mean	1
be	1
he	1
who	1
thinks	1
himself	1
mean.”	1
“In	1
God’s	1
name	1
let	1
him	1
be	1
so,”	1
said	1
Sancho:	1
“I	1
am	1
an	1
old	1
Christian,	1
and	1
to	1
fit	1
me	1
for	1
a	1
count	1
that’s	1
enough.”	1
“And	1
more	1
than	1
enough	1
for	1
thee,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
“and	1
even	1
wert	1
thou	1
not,	1
it	1
would	1
make	1
no	1
difference,	1
because	1
I	1
being	1
the	1
king	1
can	1
easily	1
give	1
thee	1
nobility	1
without	1
purchase	1
or	1
service	1
rendered	1
by	1
thee,	1
for	1
when	1
I	1
make	1
thee	1
a	1
count,	1
then	1
thou	1
art	1
at	1
once	1
a	1
gentleman;	1
and	1
they	1
may	1
say	1
what	1
they	1
will,	1
but	1
by	1
my	1
faith	1
they	1
will	1
have	1
to	1
call	1
thee	1
‘your	1
lordship,’	1
whether	1
they	1
like	1
it	1
or	1
not.”	1
“Not	1
a	1
doubt	1
of	1
it;	1
and	1
I’ll	1
know	1
how	1
to	1
support	1
the	1
tittle,”	1
said	1
Sancho.	1
“Title	1
thou	1
shouldst	1
say,	1
not	1
tittle,”	1
said	1
his	1
master.	1
“So	1
be	1
it,”	1
answered	1
Sancho.	1
“I	1
say	1
I	1
will	1
know	1
how	1
to	1
behave,	1
for	1
once	1
in	1
my	1
life	1
I	1
was	1
beadle	1
of	1
a	1
brotherhood,	1
and	1
the	1
beadle’s	1
gown	1
sat	1
so	1
well	1
on	1
me	1
that	1
all	1
said	1
I	1
looked	1
as	1
if	1
I	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
steward	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
brotherhood.	1
What	1
will	1
it	1
be,	1
then,	1
when	1
I	1
put	1
a	1
duke’s	1
robe	1
on	1
my	1
back,	1
or	1
dress	1
myself	1
in	1
gold	1
and	1
pearls	1
like	1
a	1
count?	1
I	1
believe	1
they’ll	1
come	1
a	1
hundred	1
leagues	1
to	1
see	1
me.”	1
“Thou	1
wilt	1
look	1
well,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“but	1
thou	1
must	1
shave	1
thy	1
beard	1
often,	1
for	1
thou	1
hast	1
it	1
so	1
thick	1
and	1
rough	1
and	1
unkempt,	1
that	1
if	1
thou	1
dost	1
not	1
shave	1
it	1
every	1
second	1
day	1
at	1
least,	1
they	1
will	1
see	1
what	1
thou	1
art	1
at	1
the	1
distance	1
of	1
a	1
musket	1
shot.”	1
“What	1
more	1
will	1
it	1
be,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“than	1
having	1
a	1
barber,	1
and	1
keeping	1
him	1
at	1
wages	1
in	1
the	1
house?	1
and	1
even	1
if	1
it	1
be	1
necessary,	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
him	1
go	1
behind	1
me	1
like	1
a	1
nobleman’s	1
equerry.”	1
“Why,	1
how	1
dost	1
thou	1
know	1
that	1
noblemen	1
have	1
equerries	1
behind	1
them?”	1
asked	1
Don	1
Quixote.	1
“I	1
will	1
tell	1
you,”	1
answered	1
Sancho.	1
“Years	1
ago	1
I	1
was	1
for	1
a	1
month	1
at	1
the	1
capital	1
and	1
there	1
I	1
saw	1
taking	1
the	1
air	1
a	1
very	1
small	1
gentleman	1
who	1
they	1
said	1
was	1
a	1
very	1
great	1
man,	1
and	1
a	1
man	1
following	1
him	1
on	1
horseback	1
in	1
every	1
turn	1
he	1
took,	1
just	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
was	1
his	1
tail.	1
I	1
asked	1
why	1
this	1
man	1
did	1
not	1
join	1
the	1
other	1
man,	1
instead	1
of	1
always	1
going	1
behind	1
him;	1
they	1
answered	1
me	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
his	1
equerry,	1
and	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
custom	1
with	1
nobles	1
to	1
have	1
such	1
persons	1
behind	1
them,	1
and	1
ever	1
since	1
then	1
I	1
know	1
it,	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
never	1
forgotten	1
it.”	1
“Thou	1
art	1
right,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“and	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
way	1
thou	1
mayest	1
carry	1
thy	1
barber	1
with	1
thee,	1
for	1
customs	1
did	1
not	1
come	1
into	1
use	1
all	1
together,	1
nor	1
were	1
they	1
all	1
invented	1
at	1
once,	1
and	1
thou	1
mayest	1
be	1
the	1
first	1
count	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
barber	1
to	1
follow	1
him;	1
and,	1
indeed,	1
shaving	1
one’s	1
beard	1
is	1
a	1
greater	1
trust	1
than	1
saddling	1
one’s	1
horse.”	1
“Let	1
the	1
barber	1
business	1
be	1
my	1
look-out,”	1
said	1
Sancho;	1
“and	1
your	1
worship’s	1
be	1
it	1
to	1
strive	1
to	1
become	1
a	1
king,	1
and	1
make	1
me	1
a	1
count.”	1
“So	1
it	1
shall	1
be,”	1
answered	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
and	1
raising	1
his	1
eyes	1
he	1
saw	1

will	1

Benengeli,	1

relates	1
in	1
this	1
most	1
grave,	1
high-sounding,	1
minute,	1
delightful,	1
and	1
original	1
history	1
that	1
after	1
the	1
discussion	1
between	1
the	1
famous	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
of	1
La	1
Mancha	1
and	1
his	1
squire	1
Sancho	1
Panza	1
which	1
is	1
set	1
down	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
chapter	1
twenty-one,	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
raised	1
his	1
eyes	1
and	1
saw	1
coming	1
along	1
the	1
road	1
he	1
was	1
following	1
some	1
dozen	1
men	1
on	1
foot	1
strung	1
together	1
by	1
the	1
neck,	1
like	1
beads,	1
on	1
a	1
great	1
iron	1
chain,	1
and	1
all	1
with	1
manacles	1
on	1
their	1
hands.	1
With	1
them	1
there	1
came	1
also	1
two	1
men	1
on	1
horseback	1
and	1
two	1
on	1
foot;	1
those	1
on	1
horseback	1
with	1
wheel-lock	1
muskets,	1
those	1
on	1
foot	1
with	1
javelins	1
and	1
swords,	1
and	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
Sancho	1
saw	1
them	1
he	1
said:	1
“That	1
is	1
a	1
chain	1
of	1
galley	1
slaves,	1
on	1
the	1
way	1
to	1
the	1
galleys	1
by	1
force	1
of	1
the	1
king’s	1
orders.”	1
“How	1
by	1
force?”	1
asked	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
“is	1
it	1
possible	1
that	1
the	1
king	1
uses	1
force	1
against	1
anyone?”	1
“I	1
do	1
not	1
say	1
that,”	1
answered	1
Sancho,	1
“but	1
that	1
these	1
are	1
people	1
condemned	1
for	1
their	1
crimes	1
to	1
serve	1
by	1
force	1
in	1
the	1
king’s	1
galleys.”	1
“In	1
fact,”	1
replied	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“however	1
it	1
may	1
be,	1
these	1
people	1
are	1
going	1
where	1
they	1
are	1
taking	1
them	1
by	1
force,	1
and	1
not	1
of	1
their	1
own	1
will.”	1
“Just	1
so,”	1
said	1
Sancho.	1
“Then	1
if	1
so,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“here	1
is	1
a	1
case	1
for	1
the	1
exercise	1
of	1
my	1
office,	1
to	1
put	1
down	1
force	1
and	1
to	1
succour	1
and	1
help	1
the	1
wretched.”	1
“Recollect,	1
your	1
worship,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“Justice,	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
king	1
himself,	1
is	1
not	1
using	1
force	1
or	1
doing	1
wrong	1
to	1
such	1
persons,	1
but	1
punishing	1
them	1
for	1
their	1
crimes.”	1
The	1
chain	1
of	1
galley	1
slaves	1
had	1
by	1
this	1
time	1
come	1
up,	1
and	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
in	1
very	1
courteous	1
language	1
asked	1
those	1
who	1
were	1
in	1
custody	1
of	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
good	1
enough	1
to	1
tell	1
him	1
the	1
reason	1
or	1
reasons	1
for	1
which	1
they	1
were	1
conducting	1
these	1
people	1
in	1
this	1
manner.	1
One	1
of	1
the	1
guards	1
on	1
horseback	1
answered	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
galley	1
slaves	1
belonging	1
to	1
his	1
majesty,	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
going	1
to	1
the	1
galleys,	1
and	1
that	1
was	1
all	1
that	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
said	1
and	1
all	1
he	1
had	1
any	1
business	1
to	1
know.	1

“Nevertheless,”	1
replied	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“I	1
should	1
like	1
to	1
know	1
from	1
each	1
of	1
them	1
separately	1
the	1
reason	1
of	1
his	1
misfortune;”	1
to	1
this	1
he	1
added	1
more	1
to	1
the	1
same	1
effect	1
to	1
induce	1
them	1
to	1
tell	1
him	1
what	1
he	1
wanted	1
so	1
civilly	1
that	1
the	1
other	1
mounted	1
guard	1
said	1
to	1
him:	1
“Though	1
we	1
have	1
here	1
the	1
register	1
and	1
certificate	1
of	1
the	1
sentence	1
of	1
every	1
one	1
of	1
these	1
wretches,	1
this	1
is	1
no	1
time	1
to	1
take	1
them	1
out	1
or	1
read	1
them;	1
come	1
and	1
ask	1
themselves;	1
they	1
can	1
tell	1
if	1
they	1
choose,	1
and	1
they	1
will,	1
for	1
these	1
fellows	1
take	1
a	1
pleasure	1
in	1
doing	1
and	1
talking	1
about	1
rascalities.”	1
With	1
this	1
permission,	1
which	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
would	1
have	1
taken	1
even	1
had	1
they	1
not	1
granted	1
it,	1
he	1
approached	1
the	1
chain	1
and	1
asked	1
the	1
first	1
for	1
what	1
offences	1
he	1
was	1
now	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
sorry	1
case.	1
He	1
made	1
answer	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
for	1
being	1
a	1
lover.	1
“For	1
that	1
only?”	1
replied	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
“why,	1
if	1
for	1
being	1
lovers	1
they	1
send	1
people	1
to	1
the	1
galleys	1
I	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
rowing	1
in	1
them	1
long	1
ago.”	1
“The	1
love	1
is	1
not	1
the	1
sort	1
your	1
worship	1
is	1
thinking	1
of,”	1
said	1
the	1
galley	1
slave;	1
“mine	1
was	1
that	1
I	1
loved	1
a	1
washerwoman’s	1
basket	1
of	1
clean	1
linen	1
so	1
well,	1
and	1
held	1
it	1
so	1
close	1
in	1
my	1
embrace,	1
that	1
if	1
the	1
arm	1
of	1
the	1
law	1
had	1
not	1
forced	1
it	1
from	1
me,	1
I	1
should	1
never	1
have	1
let	1
it	1
go	1
of	1
my	1
own	1
will	1
to	1
this	1
moment;	1
I	1
was	1
caught	1
in	1
the	1
act,	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
occasion	1
for	1
torture,	1
the	1
case	1
was	1
settled,	1
they	1
treated	1
me	1
to	1
a	1
hundred	1
lashes	1
on	1
the	1
back,	1
and	1
three	1
years	1
of	1
gurapas	1
besides,	1
and	1
that	1
was	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
it.”	1
“What	1
are	1
gurapas?”	1
asked	1
Don	1
Quixote.	1
“Gurapas	1
are	1
galleys,”	1
answered	1
the	1
galley	1
slave,	1
who	1
was	1
a	1
young	1
man	1
of	1
about	1
four-and-twenty,	1
and	1
said	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
native	1
of	1
Piedrahita.	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
asked	1
the	1
same	1
question	1
of	1
the	1
second,	1
who	1
made	1
no	1
reply,	1
so	1
downcast	1
and	1
melancholy	1
was	1
he;	1
but	1
the	1
first	1
answered	1
for	1
him,	1
and	1
said,	1
“He,	1
sir,	1
goes	1
as	1
a	1
canary,	1
I	1
mean	1
as	1
a	1
musician	1
and	1
a	1
singer.”	1
“What!”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“for	1
being	1
musicians	1
and	1
singers	1
are	1
people	1
sent	1
to	1
the	1
galleys	1
too?”	1
“Yes,	1
sir,”	1
answered	1
the	1
galley	1
slave,	1
“for	1
there	1
is	1
nothing	1
worse	1
than	1
singing	1
under	1
suffering.”	1
“On	1
the	1
contrary,	1
I	1
have	1
heard	1
say,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“that	1
he	1
who	1
sings	1
scares	1
away	1
his	1
woes.”	1
“Here	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
reverse,”	1
said	1
the	1
galley	1
slave;	1
“for	1
he	1
who	1
sings	1
once	1
weeps	1
all	1
his	1
life.”	1
“I	1
do	1
not	1
understand	1
it,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
but	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
guards	1
said	1
to	1
him,	1
“Sir,	1
to	1
sing	1
under	1
suffering	1
means	1
with	1
the	1
_non	1
sancta_	1
fraternity	1
to	1
confess	1
under	1
torture;	1
they	1
put	1
this	1
sinner	1
to	1
the	1
torture	1
and	1
he	1
confessed	1
his	1
crime,	1
which	1
was	1
being	1
a	1
cuatrero,	1
that	1
is	1
a	1
cattle-stealer,	1
and	1
on	1
his	1
confession	1
they	1
sentenced	1
him	1
to	1
six	1
years	1
in	1
the	1
galleys,	1
besides	1
two	1
hundred	1
lashes	1
that	1
he	1
has	1
already	1
had	1
on	1
the	1
back;	1
and	1
he	1
is	1
always	1
dejected	1
and	1
downcast	1
because	1
the	1
other	1
thieves	1
that	1
were	1
left	1
behind	1
and	1
that	1
march	1
here	1
ill-treat,	1
and	1
snub,	1
and	1
jeer,	1
and	1
despise	1
him	1
for	1
confessing	1
and	1
not	1
having	1
spirit	1
enough	1
to	1
say	1
nay;	1
for,	1
say	1
they,	1
‘nay’	1
has	1
no	1
more	1
letters	1
in	1
it	1
than	1
‘yea,’	1
and	1
a	1
culprit	1
is	1
well	1
off	1
when	1
life	1
or	1
death	1
with	1
him	1
depends	1
on	1
his	1
own	1
tongue	1
and	1
not	1
on	1
that	1
of	1
witnesses	1
or	1
evidence;	1
and	1
to	1
my	1
thinking	1
they	1
are	1
not	1
very	1
far	1
out.”	1
“And	1
I	1
think	1
so	1
too,”	1
answered	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
then	1
passing	1
on	1
to	1
the	1
third	1
he	1
asked	1
him	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
asked	1
the	1
others,	1
and	1
the	1
man	1
answered	1
very	1
readily	1
and	1
unconcernedly,	1
“I	1
am	1
going	1
for	1
five	1
years	1
to	1
their	1
ladyships	1
the	1
gurapas	1
for	1
the	1
want	1
of	1
ten	1
ducats.”	1
“I	1
will	1
give	1
twenty	1
with	1
pleasure	1
to	1
get	1
you	1
out	1
of	1
that	1
trouble,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote.	1
“That,”	1
said	1
the	1
galley	1
slave,	1
“is	1
like	1
a	1
man	1
having	1
money	1
at	1
sea	1
when	1
he	1
is	1
dying	1
of	1
hunger	1
and	1
has	1
no	1
way	1
of	1
buying	1
what	1
he	1
wants;	1
I	1
say	1
so	1
because	1
if	1
at	1
the	1
right	1
time	1
I	1
had	1
had	1
those	1
twenty	1
ducats	1
that	1
your	1
worship	1
now	1
offers	1
me,	1
I	1
would	1
have	1
greased	1
the	1
notary’s	1
pen	1
and	1
freshened	1
up	1
the	1
attorney’s	1
wit	1
with	1
them,	1
so	1
that	1
to-day	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
plaza	1
of	1
the	1
Zocodover	1
at	1
Toledo,	1
and	1
not	1
on	1
this	1
road	1
coupled	1
like	1
a	1
greyhound.	1
But	1
God	1
is	1
great;	1
patience—there,	1
that’s	1
enough	1
of	1
it.”	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
passed	1
on	1
to	1
the	1
fourth,	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
venerable	1
aspect	1
with	1
a	1
white	1
beard	1
falling	1
below	1
his	1
breast,	1
who	1
on	1
hearing	1
himself	1
asked	1
the	1
reason	1
of	1
his	1
being	1
there	1
began	1
to	1
weep	1
without	1
answering	1
a	1
word,	1
but	1
the	1
fifth	1
acted	1
as	1
his	1
tongue	1
and	1
said,	1
“This	1
worthy	1
man	1
is	1
going	1
to	1
the	1
galleys	1
for	1
four	1
years,	1
after	1
having	1
gone	1
the	1
rounds	1
in	1
ceremony	1
and	1
on	1
horseback.”	1
“That	1
means,”	1
said	1
Sancho	1
Panza,	1
“as	1
I	1
take	1
it,	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
exposed	1
to	1
shame	1
in	1
public.”	1
“Just	1
so,”	1
replied	1
the	1
galley	1
slave,	1
“and	1
the	1
offence	1
for	1
which	1
they	1
gave	1
him	1
that	1
punishment	1
was	1
having	1
been	1
an	1
ear-broker,	1
nay	1
body-broker;	1
I	1
mean,	1
in	1
short,	1
that	1
this	1
gentleman	1
goes	1
as	1
a	1
pimp,	1
and	1
for	1
having	1
besides	1
a	1
certain	1
touch	1
of	1
the	1
sorcerer	1
about	1
him.”	1
“If	1
that	1
touch	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
thrown	1
in,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“he	1
would	1
not	1
deserve,	1
for	1
mere	1
pimping,	1
to	1
row	1
in	1
the	1
galleys,	1
but	1
rather	1
to	1
command	1
and	1
be	1
admiral	1
of	1
them;	1
for	1
the	1
office	1
of	1
pimp	1
is	1
no	1
ordinary	1
one,	1
being	1
the	1
office	1
of	1
persons	1
of	1
discretion,	1
one	1
very	1
necessary	1
in	1
a	1
well-ordered	1
state,	1
and	1
only	1
to	1
be	1
exercised	1
by	1
persons	1
of	1
good	1
birth;	1
nay,	1
there	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
an	1
inspector	1
and	1
overseer	1
of	1
them,	1
as	1
in	1
other	1
offices,	1
and	1
recognised	1
number,	1
as	1
with	1
the	1
brokers	1
on	1
change;	1
in	1
this	1
way	1
many	1
of	1
the	1
evils	1
would	1
be	1
avoided	1
which	1
are	1
caused	1
by	1
this	1
office	1
and	1
calling	1
being	1
in	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
stupid	1
and	1
ignorant	1
people,	1
such	1
as	1
women	1
more	1
or	1
less	1
silly,	1
and	1
pages	1
and	1
jesters	1
of	1
little	1
standing	1
and	1
experience,	1
who	1
on	1
the	1
most	1
urgent	1
occasions,	1
and	1
when	1
ingenuity	1
of	1
contrivance	1
is	1
needed,	1
let	1
the	1
crumbs	1
freeze	1
on	1
the	1
way	1
to	1
their	1
mouths,	1
and	1
know	1
not	1
which	1
is	1
their	1
right	1
hand.	1
I	1
should	1
like	1
to	1
go	1
farther,	1
and	1
give	1
reasons	1
to	1
show	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
advisable	1
to	1
choose	1
those	1
who	1
are	1
to	1
hold	1
so	1
necessary	1
an	1
office	1
in	1
the	1
state,	1
but	1
this	1
is	1
not	1
the	1
fit	1
place	1
for	1
it;	1
some	1
day	1
I	1
will	1
expound	1
the	1
matter	1
to	1
someone	1
able	1
to	1
see	1
to	1
and	1
rectify	1
it;	1
all	1
I	1
say	1
now	1
is,	1
that	1
the	1
additional	1
fact	1
of	1
his	1
being	1
a	1
sorcerer	1
has	1
removed	1
the	1
sorrow	1
it	1
gave	1
me	1
to	1
see	1
these	1
white	1
hairs	1
and	1
this	1
venerable	1
countenance	1
in	1
so	1
painful	1
a	1
position	1
on	1
account	1
of	1
his	1
being	1
a	1
pimp;	1
though	1
I	1
know	1
well	1
there	1
are	1
no	1
sorceries	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
that	1
can	1
move	1
or	1
compel	1
the	1
will	1
as	1
some	1
simple	1
folk	1
fancy,	1
for	1
our	1
will	1
is	1
free,	1
nor	1
is	1
there	1
herb	1
or	1
charm	1
that	1
can	1
force	1
it.	1
All	1
that	1
certain	1
silly	1
women	1
and	1
quacks	1
do	1
is	1
to	1
turn	1
men	1
mad	1
with	1
potions	1
and	1
poisons,	1
pretending	1
that	1
they	1
have	1
power	1
to	1
cause	1
love,	1
for,	1
as	1
I	1
say,	1
it	1
is	1
an	1
impossibility	1
to	1
compel	1
the	1
will.”	1
“It	1
is	1
true,”	1
said	1
the	1
good	1
old	1
man,	1
“and	1
indeed,	1
sir,	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
the	1
charge	1
of	1
sorcery	1
goes	1
I	1
was	1
not	1
guilty;	1
as	1
to	1
that	1
of	1
being	1
a	1
pimp	1
I	1
cannot	1
deny	1
it;	1
but	1
I	1
never	1
thought	1
I	1
was	1
doing	1
any	1
harm	1
by	1
it,	1
for	1
my	1
only	1
object	1
was	1
that	1
all	1
the	1
world	1
should	1
enjoy	1
itself	1
and	1
live	1
in	1
peace	1
and	1
quiet,	1
without	1
quarrels	1
or	1
troubles;	1
but	1
my	1
good	1
intentions	1
were	1
unavailing	1
to	1
save	1
me	1
from	1
going	1
where	1
I	1
never	1
expect	1
to	1
come	1
back	1
from,	1
with	1
this	1
weight	1
of	1
years	1
upon	1
me	1
and	1
a	1
urinary	1
ailment	1
that	1
never	1
gives	1
me	1
a	1
moment’s	1
ease;”	1
and	1
again	1
he	1
fell	1
to	1
weeping	1
as	1
before,	1
and	1
such	1
compassion	1
did	1
Sancho	1
feel	1
for	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
took	1
out	1
a	1
real	1
of	1
four	1
from	1
his	1
bosom	1
and	1
gave	1
it	1
to	1
him	1
in	1
alms.	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
went	1
on	1
and	1
asked	1
another	1
what	1
his	1
crime	1
was,	1
and	1
the	1
man	1
answered	1
with	1
no	1
less	1
but	1
rather	1
much	1
more	1
sprightliness	1
than	1
the	1
last	1
one.	1
“I	1
am	1
here	1
because	1
I	1
carried	1
the	1
joke	1
too	1
far	1
with	1
a	1
couple	1
of	1
cousins	1
of	1
mine,	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
couple	1
of	1
other	1
cousins	1
who	1
were	1
none	1
of	1
mine;	1
in	1
short,	1
I	1
carried	1
the	1
joke	1
so	1
far	1
with	1
them	1
all	1
that	1
it	1
ended	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
complicated	1
increase	1
of	1
kindred	1
that	1
no	1
accountant	1
could	1
make	1
it	1
clear:	1
it	1
was	1
all	1
proved	1
against	1
me,	1
I	1
got	1
no	1
favour,	1
I	1
had	1
no	1
money,	1
I	1
was	1
near	1
having	1
my	1
neck	1
stretched,	1
they	1
sentenced	1
me	1
to	1
the	1
galleys	1
for	1
six	1
years,	1
I	1
accepted	1
my	1
fate,	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
punishment	1
of	1
my	1
fault;	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
young	1
man;	1
let	1
life	1
only	1
last,	1
and	1
with	1
that	1
all	1
will	1
come	1
right.	1
If	1
you,	1
sir,	1
have	1
anything	1
wherewith	1
to	1
help	1
the	1
poor,	1
God	1
will	1
repay	1
it	1
to	1
you	1
in	1
heaven,	1
and	1
we	1
on	1
earth	1
will	1
take	1
care	1
in	1
our	1
petitions	1
to	1
him	1
to	1
pray	1
for	1
the	1
life	1
and	1
health	1
of	1
your	1
worship,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
be	1
as	1
long	1
and	1
as	1
good	1
as	1
your	1
amiable	1
appearance	1
deserves.”	1
This	1
one	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
dress	1
of	1
a	1
student,	1
and	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
guards	1
said	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
great	1
talker	1
and	1
a	1
very	1
elegant	1
Latin	1
scholar.	1
Behind	1
all	1
these	1
there	1
came	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
thirty,	1
a	1
very	1
personable	1
fellow,	1
except	1
that	1
when	1
he	1
looked,	1
his	1
eyes	1
turned	1
in	1
a	1
little	1
one	1
towards	1
the	1
other.	1
He	1
was	1
bound	1
differently	1
from	1
the	1
rest,	1
for	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
his	1
leg	1
a	1
chain	1
so	1
long	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
wound	1
all	1
round	1
his	1
body,	1
and	1
two	1
rings	1
on	1
his	1
neck,	1
one	1
attached	1
to	1
the	1
chain,	1
the	1
other	1
to	1
what	1
they	1
call	1
a	1
“keep-friend”	1
or	1
“friend’s	1
foot,”	1
from	1
which	1
hung	1
two	1
irons	1
reaching	1
to	1
his	1
waist	1
with	1
two	1
manacles	1
fixed	1
to	1
them	1
in	1
which	1
his	1
hands	1
were	1
secured	1
by	1
a	1
big	1
padlock,	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
neither	1
raise	1
his	1
hands	1
to	1
his	1
mouth	1
nor	1
lower	1
his	1
head	1
to	1
his	1
hands.	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
asked	1
why	1
this	1
man	1
carried	1
so	1
many	1
more	1
chains	1
than	1
the	1
others.	1
The	1
guard	1
replied	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
because	1
he	1
alone	1
had	1
committed	1
more	1
crimes	1
than	1
all	1
the	1
rest	1
put	1
together,	1
and	1
was	1
so	1
daring	1
and	1
such	1
a	1
villain,	1
that	1
though	1
they	1
marched	1
him	1
in	1
that	1
fashion	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
feel	1
sure	1
of	1
him,	1
but	1
were	1
in	1
dread	1
of	1
his	1
making	1
his	1
escape.	1
“What	1
crimes	1
can	1
he	1
have	1
committed,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“if	1
they	1
have	1
not	1
deserved	1
a	1
heavier	1
punishment	1
than	1
being	1
sent	1
to	1
the	1
galleys?”	1
“He	1
goes	1
for	1
ten	1
years,”	1
replied	1
the	1
guard,	1
“which	1
is	1
the	1
same	1
thing	1
as	1
civil	1
death,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
need	1
be	1
said	1
is	1
that	1
this	1
good	1
fellow	1
is	1
the	1
famous	1
Gines	1
de	1
Pasamonte,	1
otherwise	1
called	1
Ginesillo	1
de	1
Parapilla.”	1
“Gently,	1
señor	1
commissary,”	1
said	1
the	1
galley	1
slave	1
at	1
this,	1
“let	1
us	1
have	1
no	1
fixing	1
of	1
names	1
or	1
surnames;	1
my	1
name	1
is	1
Gines,	1
not	1
Ginesillo,	1
and	1
my	1
family	1
name	1
is	1
Pasamonte,	1
not	1
Parapilla	1
as	1
you	1
say;	1
let	1
each	1
one	1
mind	1
his	1
own	1
business,	1
and	1
he	1
will	1
be	1
doing	1
enough.”	1
“Speak	1
with	1
less	1
impertinence,	1
master	1
thief	1
of	1
extra	1
measure,”	1
replied	1
the	1
commissary,	1
“if	1
you	1
don’t	1
want	1
me	1
to	1
make	1
you	1
hold	1
your	1
tongue	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
your	1
teeth.”	1
“It	1
is	1
easy	1
to	1
see,”	1
returned	1
the	1
galley	1
slave,	1
“that	1
man	1
goes	1
as	1
God	1
pleases,	1
but	1
someone	1
shall	1
know	1
some	1
day	1
whether	1
I	1
am	1
called	1
Ginesillo	1
de	1
Parapilla	1
or	1
not.”	1
“Don’t	1
they	1
call	1
you	1
so,	1
you	1
liar?”	1
said	1
the	1
guard.	1
“They	1
do,”	1
returned	1
Gines,	1
“but	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
them	1
give	1
over	1
calling	1
me	1
so,	1
or	1
I	1
will	1
be	1
shaved,	1
where,	1
I	1
only	1
say	1
behind	1
my	1
teeth.	1
If	1
you,	1
sir,	1
have	1
anything	1
to	1
give	1
us,	1
give	1
it	1
to	1
us	1
at	1
once,	1
and	1
God	1
speed	1
you,	1
for	1
you	1
are	1
becoming	1
tiresome	1
with	1
all	1
this	1
inquisitiveness	1
about	1
the	1
lives	1
of	1
others;	1
if	1
you	1
want	1
to	1
know	1
about	1
mine,	1
let	1
me	1
tell	1
you	1
I	1
am	1
Gines	1
de	1
Pasamonte,	1
whose	1
life	1
is	1
written	1
by	1
these	1
fingers.”	1
“He	1
says	1
true,”	1
said	1
the	1
commissary,	1
“for	1
he	1
has	1
himself	1
written	1
his	1
story	1
as	1
grand	1
as	1
you	1
please,	1
and	1
has	1
left	1
the	1
book	1
in	1
the	1
prison	1
in	1
pawn	1
for	1
two	1
hundred	1
reals.”	1
“And	1
I	1
mean	1
to	1
take	1
it	1
out	1
of	1
pawn,”	1
said	1
Gines,	1
“though	1
it	1
were	1
in	1
for	1
two	1
hundred	1
ducats.”	1
“Is	1
it	1
so	1
good?”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote.	1
“So	1
good	1
is	1
it,”	1
replied	1
Gines,	1
“that	1
a	1
fig	1
for	1
‘Lazarillo	1
de	1
Tormes,’	1
and	1
all	1
of	1
that	1
kind	1
that	1
have	1
been	1
written,	1
or	1
shall	1
be	1
written	1
compared	1
with	1
it:	1
all	1
I	1
will	1
say	1
about	1
it	1
is	1
that	1
it	1
deals	1
with	1
facts,	1
and	1
facts	1
so	1
neat	1
and	1
diverting	1
that	1
no	1
lies	1
could	1
match	1
them.”	1
“And	1
how	1
is	1
the	1
book	1
entitled?”	1
asked	1
Don	1
Quixote.	1
“The	1
‘Life	1
of	1
Gines	1
de	1
Pasamonte,’”	1
replied	1
the	1
subject	1
of	1
it.	1
“And	1
is	1
it	1
finished?”	1
asked	1
Don	1
Quixote.	1
“How	1
can	1
it	1
be	1
finished,”	1
said	1
the	1
other,	1
“when	1
my	1
life	1
is	1
not	1
yet	1
finished?	1
All	1
that	1
is	1
written	1
is	1
from	1
my	1
birth	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
point	1
when	1
they	1
sent	1
me	1
to	1
the	1
galleys	1
this	1
last	1
time.”	1
“Then	1
you	1
have	1
been	1
there	1
before?”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote.	1
“In	1
the	1
service	1
of	1
God	1
and	1
the	1
king	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
there	1
for	1
four	1
years	1
before	1
now,	1
and	1
I	1
know	1
by	1
this	1
time	1
what	1
the	1
biscuit	1
and	1
courbash	1
are	1
like,”	1
replied	1
Gines;	1
“and	1
it	1
is	1
no	1
great	1
grievance	1
to	1
me	1
to	1
go	1
back	1
to	1
them,	1
for	1
there	1
I	1
shall	1
have	1
time	1
to	1
finish	1
my	1
book;	1
I	1
have	1
still	1
many	1
things	1
left	1
to	1
say,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
galleys	1
of	1
Spain	1
there	1
is	1
more	1
than	1
enough	1
leisure;	1
though	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
want	1
much	1
for	1
what	1
I	1
have	1
to	1
write,	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
it	1
by	1
heart.”	1
“You	1
seem	1
a	1
clever	1
fellow,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote.	1
“And	1
an	1
unfortunate	1
one,”	1
replied	1
Gines,	1
“for	1
misfortune	1
always	1
persecutes	1
good	1
wit.”	1
“It	1
persecutes	1
rogues,”	1
said	1
the	1
commissary.	1
“I	1
told	1
you	1
already	1
to	1
go	1
gently,	1
master	1
commissary,”	1
said	1
Pasamonte;	1
“their	1
lordships	1
yonder	1
never	1
gave	1
you	1
that	1
staff	1
to	1
ill-treat	1
us	1
wretches	1
here,	1
but	1
to	1
conduct	1
and	1
take	1
us	1
where	1
his	1
majesty	1
orders	1
you;	1
if	1
not,	1
by	1
the	1
life	1
of-never	1
mind—;	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
that	1
some	1
day	1
the	1
stains	1
made	1
in	1
the	1
inn	1
will	1
come	1
out	1
in	1
the	1
scouring;	1
let	1
everyone	1
hold	1
his	1
tongue	1
and	1
behave	1
well	1
and	1
speak	1
better;	1
and	1
now	1
let	1
us	1
march	1
on,	1
for	1
we	1
have	1
had	1
quite	1
enough	1
of	1
this	1
entertainment.”	1
The	1
commissary	1
lifted	1
his	1
staff	1
to	1
strike	1
Pasamonte	1
in	1
return	1
for	1
his	1
threats,	1
but	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
came	1
between	1
them,	1
and	1
begged	1
him	1
not	1
to	1
ill-use	1
him,	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
too	1
much	1
to	1
allow	1
one	1
who	1
had	1
his	1
hands	1
tied	1
to	1
have	1
his	1
tongue	1
a	1
trifle	1
free;	1
and	1
turning	1
to	1
the	1
whole	1
chain	1
of	1
them	1
he	1
said:	1
“From	1
all	1
you	1
have	1
told	1
me,	1
dear	1
brethren,	1
make	1
out	1
clearly	1
that	1
though	1
they	1
have	1
punished	1
you	1
for	1
your	1
faults,	1
the	1
punishments	1
you	1
are	1
about	1
to	1
endure	1
do	1
not	1
give	1
you	1
much	1
pleasure,	1
and	1
that	1
you	1
go	1
to	1
them	1
very	1
much	1
against	1
the	1
grain	1
and	1
against	1
your	1
will,	1
and	1
that	1
perhaps	1
this	1
one’s	1
want	1
of	1
courage	1
under	1
torture,	1
that	1
one’s	1
want	1
of	1
money,	1
the	1
other’s	1
want	1
of	1
advocacy,	1
and	1
lastly	1
the	1
perverted	1
judgment	1
of	1
the	1
judge	1
may	1
have	1
been	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
your	1
ruin	1
and	1
of	1
your	1
failure	1
to	1
obtain	1
the	1
justice	1
you	1
had	1
on	1
your	1
side.	1
All	1
which	1
presents	1
itself	1
now	1
to	1
my	1
mind,	1
urging,	1
persuading,	1
and	1
even	1
compelling	1
me	1
to	1
demonstrate	1
in	1
your	1
case	1
the	1
purpose	1
for	1
which	1
Heaven	1
sent	1
me	1
into	1
the	1
world	1
and	1
caused	1
me	1
to	1
make	1
profession	1
of	1
the	1
order	1
of	1
chivalry	1
to	1
which	1
I	1
belong,	1
and	1
the	1
vow	1
I	1
took	1
therein	1
to	1
give	1
aid	1
to	1
those	1
in	1
need	1
and	1
under	1
the	1
oppression	1
of	1
the	1
strong.	1
But	1
as	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
mark	1
of	1
prudence	1
not	1
to	1
do	1
by	1
foul	1
means	1
what	1
may	1
be	1
done	1
by	1
fair,	1
I	1
will	1
ask	1
these	1
gentlemen,	1
the	1
guards	1
and	1
commissary,	1
to	1
be	1
so	1
good	1
as	1
to	1
release	1
you	1
and	1
let	1
you	1
go	1
in	1
peace,	1
as	1
there	1
will	1
be	1
no	1
lack	1
of	1
others	1
to	1
serve	1
the	1
king	1
under	1
more	1
favourable	1
circumstances;	1
for	1
it	1
seems	1
to	1
me	1
a	1
hard	1
case	1
to	1
make	1
slaves	1
of	1
those	1
whom	1
God	1
and	1
nature	1
have	1
made	1
free.	1
Moreover,	1
sirs	1
of	1
the	1
guard,”	1
added	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“these	1
poor	1
fellows	1
have	1
done	1
nothing	1
to	1
you;	1
let	1
each	1
answer	1
for	1
his	1
own	1
sins	1
yonder;	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
God	1
in	1
Heaven	1
who	1
will	1
not	1
forget	1
to	1
punish	1
the	1
wicked	1
or	1
reward	1
the	1
good;	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
fitting	1
that	1
honest	1
men	1
should	1
be	1
the	1
instruments	1
of	1
punishment	1
to	1
others,	1
they	1
being	1
therein	1
no	1
way	1
concerned.	1
This	1
request	1
I	1
make	1
thus	1
gently	1
and	1
quietly,	1
that,	1
if	1
you	1
comply	1
with	1
it,	1
I	1
may	1
have	1
reason	1
for	1
thanking	1
you;	1
and,	1
if	1
you	1
will	1
not	1
voluntarily,	1
this	1
lance	1
and	1
sword	1
together	1
with	1
the	1
might	1
of	1
my	1
arm	1
shall	1
compel	1
you	1
to	1
comply	1
with	1
it	1
by	1
force.”	1
“Nice	1
nonsense!”	1
said	1
the	1
commissary;	1
“a	1
fine	1
piece	1
of	1
pleasantry	1
he	1
has	1
come	1
out	1
with	1
at	1
last!	1
He	1
wants	1
us	1
to	1
let	1
the	1
king’s	1
prisoners	1
go,	1
as	1
if	1
we	1
had	1
any	1
authority	1
to	1
release	1
them,	1
or	1
he	1
to	1
order	1
us	1
to	1
do	1
so!	1
Go	1
your	1
way,	1
sir,	1
and	1
good	1
luck	1
to	1
you;	1
put	1
that	1
basin	1
straight	1
that	1
you’ve	1
got	1
on	1
your	1
head,	1
and	1
don’t	1
go	1
looking	1
for	1
three	1
feet	1
on	1
a	1
cat.”	1
“’Tis	1
you	1
that	1
are	1
the	1
cat,	1
rat,	1
and	1
rascal,”	1
replied	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
and	1
acting	1
on	1
the	1
word	1
he	1
fell	1
upon	1
him	1
so	1
suddenly	1
that	1
without	1
giving	1
him	1
time	1
to	1
defend	1
himself	1
he	1
brought	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
ground	1
sorely	1
wounded	1
with	1
a	1
lance-thrust;	1
and	1
lucky	1
it	1
was	1
for	1
him	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
one	1
that	1
had	1
the	1
musket.	1
The	1
other	1
guards	1
stood	1
thunderstruck	1
and	1
amazed	1
at	1
this	1
unexpected	1
event,	1
but	1
recovering	1
presence	1
of	1
mind,	1
those	1
on	1
horseback	1
seized	1
their	1
swords,	1
and	1
those	1
on	1
foot	1
their	1
javelins,	1
and	1
attacked	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
who	1
was	1
waiting	1
for	1
them	1
with	1
great	1
calmness;	1
and	1
no	1
doubt	1
it	1
would	1
have	1
gone	1
badly	1
with	1
him	1
if	1
the	1
galley	1
slaves,	1
seeing	1
the	1
chance	1
before	1
them	1
of	1
liberating	1
themselves,	1
had	1
not	1
effected	1
it	1
by	1
contriving	1
to	1
break	1
the	1
chain	1
on	1
which	1
they	1
were	1
strung.	1
Such	1
was	1
the	1
confusion,	1
that	1
the	1
guards,	1
now	1
rushing	1
at	1
the	1
galley	1
slaves	1
who	1
were	1
breaking	1
loose,	1
now	1
to	1
attack	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
who	1
was	1
waiting	1
for	1
them,	1
did	1
nothing	1
at	1
all	1
that	1
was	1
of	1
any	1
use.	1
Sancho,	1
on	1
his	1
part,	1
gave	1
a	1
helping	1
hand	1
to	1
release	1
Gines	1
de	1
Pasamonte,	1
who	1
was	1
the	1
first	1
to	1
leap	1
forth	1
upon	1
the	1
plain	1
free	1
and	1
unfettered,	1
and	1
who,	1
attacking	1
the	1
prostrate	1
commissary,	1
took	1
from	1
him	1
his	1
sword	1
and	1
the	1
musket,	1
with	1
which,	1
aiming	1
at	1
one	1
and	1
levelling	1
at	1
another,	1
he,	1
without	1
ever	1
discharging	1
it,	1
drove	1
every	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
guards	1
off	1
the	1
field,	1
for	1
they	1
took	1
to	1
flight,	1
as	1
well	1
to	1
escape	1
Pasamonte’s	1
musket,	1
as	1
the	1
showers	1
of	1
stones	1
the	1
now	1
released	1
galley	1
slaves	1
were	1
raining	1
upon	1
them.	1
Sancho	1
was	1
greatly	1
grieved	1
at	1
the	1
affair,	1
because	1
he	1
anticipated	1
that	1
those	1
who	1
had	1
fled	1
would	1
report	1
the	1
matter	1
to	1
the	1
Holy	1
Brotherhood,	1
who	1
at	1
the	1
summons	1
of	1
the	1
alarm-bell	1
would	1
at	1
once	1
sally	1
forth	1
in	1
quest	1
of	1
the	1
offenders;	1
and	1
he	1
said	1
so	1
to	1
his	1
master,	1
and	1
entreated	1
him	1
to	1
leave	1
the	1
place	1
at	1
once,	1
and	1
go	1
into	1
hiding	1
in	1
the	1
sierra	1
that	1
was	1
close	1
by.	1
“That	1
is	1
all	1
very	1
well,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“but	1
I	1
know	1
what	1
must	1
be	1
done	1
now;”	1
and	1
calling	1
together	1
all	1
the	1
galley	1
slaves,	1
who	1
were	1
now	1
running	1
riot,	1
and	1
had	1
stripped	1
the	1
commissary	1
to	1
the	1
skin,	1
he	1
collected	1
them	1
round	1
him	1
to	1
hear	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
say,	1
and	1
addressed	1
them	1
as	1
follows:	1
“To	1
be	1
grateful	1
for	1
benefits	1
received	1
is	1
the	1
part	1
of	1
persons	1
of	1
good	1
birth,	1
and	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
sins	1
most	1
offensive	1
to	1
God	1
is	1
ingratitude;	1
I	1
say	1
so	1
because,	1
sirs,	1
ye	1
have	1
already	1
seen	1
by	1
manifest	1
proof	1
the	1
benefit	1
ye	1
have	1
received	1
of	1
me;	1
in	1
return	1
for	1
which	1
I	1
desire,	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
my	1
good	1
pleasure	1
that,	1
laden	1
with	1
that	1
chain	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
taken	1
off	1
your	1
necks,	1
ye	1
at	1
once	1
set	1
out	1
and	1
proceed	1
to	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
El	1
Toboso,	1
and	1
there	1
present	1
yourselves	1
before	1
the	1
lady	1
Dulcinea	1
del	1
Toboso,	1
and	1
say	1
to	1
her	1
that	1
her	1
knight,	1
he	1
of	1
the	1
Rueful	1
Countenance,	1
sends	1
to	1
commend	1
himself	1
to	1
her;	1
and	1
that	1
ye	1
recount	1
to	1
her	1
in	1
full	1
detail	1
all	1
the	1
particulars	1
of	1
this	1
notable	1
adventure,	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
recovery	1
of	1
your	1
longed-for	1
liberty;	1
and	1
this	1
done	1
ye	1
may	1
go	1
where	1
ye	1
will,	1
and	1
good	1
fortune	1
attend	1
you.”	1
Gines	1
de	1
Pasamonte	1
made	1
answer	1
for	1
all,	1
saying,	1
“That	1
which	1
you,	1
sir,	1
our	1
deliverer,	1
demand	1
of	1
us,	1
is	1
of	1
all	1
impossibilities	1
the	1
most	1
impossible	1
to	1
comply	1
with,	1
because	1
we	1
cannot	1
go	1
together	1
along	1
the	1
roads,	1
but	1
only	1
singly	1
and	1
separate,	1
and	1
each	1
one	1
his	1
own	1
way,	1
endeavouring	1
to	1
hide	1
ourselves	1
in	1
the	1
bowels	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
to	1
escape	1
the	1
Holy	1
Brotherhood,	1
which,	1
no	1
doubt,	1
will	1
come	1
out	1
in	1
search	1
of	1
us.	1
What	1
your	1
worship	1
may	1
do,	1
and	1
fairly	1
do,	1
is	1
to	1
change	1
this	1
service	1
and	1
tribute	1
as	1
regards	1
the	1
lady	1
Dulcinea	1
del	1
Toboso	1
for	1
a	1
certain	1
quantity	1
of	1
ave-marias	1
and	1
credos	1
which	1
we	1
will	1
say	1
for	1
your	1
worship’s	1
intention,	1
and	1
this	1
is	1
a	1
condition	1
that	1
can	1
be	1
complied	1
with	1
by	1
night	1
as	1
by	1
day,	1
running	1
or	1
resting,	1
in	1
peace	1
or	1
in	1
war;	1
but	1
to	1
imagine	1
that	1
we	1
are	1
going	1
now	1
to	1
return	1
to	1
the	1
flesh-pots	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
I	1
mean	1
to	1
take	1
up	1
our	1
chain	1
and	1
set	1
out	1
for	1
El	1
Toboso,	1
is	1
to	1
imagine	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
now	1
night,	1
though	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
yet	1
ten	1
in	1
the	1
morning,	1
and	1
to	1
ask	1
this	1
of	1
us	1
is	1
like	1
asking	1
pears	1
of	1
the	1
elm	1
tree.”	1
“Then	1
by	1
all	1
that’s	1
good,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
(now	1
stirred	1
to	1
wrath),	1
“Don	1
son	1
of	1
a	1
bitch,	1
Don	1
Ginesillo	1
de	1
Paropillo,	1
or	1
whatever	1
your	1
name	1
is,	1
you	1
will	1
have	1
to	1
go	1
yourself	1
alone,	1
with	1
your	1
tail	1
between	1
your	1
legs	1
and	1
the	1
whole	1
chain	1
on	1
your	1
back.”	1
Pasamonte,	1
who	1
was	1
anything	1
but	1
meek	1
(being	1
by	1
this	1
time	1
thoroughly	1
convinced	1
that	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
was	1
not	1
quite	1
right	1
in	1
his	1
head	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
committed	1
such	1
a	1
vagary	1
as	1
to	1
set	1
them	1
free),	1
finding	1
himself	1
abused	1
in	1
this	1
fashion,	1
gave	1
the	1
wink	1
to	1
his	1
companions,	1
and	1
falling	1
back	1
they	1
began	1
to	1
shower	1
stones	1
on	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
at	1
such	1
a	1
rate	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
quite	1
unable	1
to	1
protect	1
himself	1
with	1
his	1
buckler,	1
and	1
poor	1
Rocinante	1
no	1
more	1
heeded	1
the	1
spur	1
than	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
made	1
of	1
brass.	1
Sancho	1
planted	1
himself	1
behind	1
his	1
ass,	1
and	1
with	1
him	1
sheltered	1
himself	1
from	1
the	1
hailstorm	1
that	1
poured	1
on	1
both	1
of	1
them.	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
was	1
unable	1
to	1
shield	1
himself	1
so	1
well	1
but	1
that	1
more	1
pebbles	1
than	1
I	1
could	1
count	1
struck	1
him	1
full	1
on	1
the	1
body	1
with	1
such	1
force	1
that	1
they	1
brought	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
ground;	1
and	1
the	1
instant	1
he	1
fell	1
the	1
student	1
pounced	1
upon	1
him,	1
snatched	1
the	1
basin	1
from	1
his	1
head,	1
and	1
with	1
it	1
struck	1
three	1
or	1
four	1
blows	1
on	1
his	1
shoulders,	1
and	1
as	1
many	1
more	1
on	1
the	1
ground,	1
knocking	1
it	1
almost	1
to	1
pieces.	1
They	1
then	1
stripped	1
him	1
of	1
a	1
jacket	1
that	1
he	1
wore	1
over	1
his	1
armour,	1
and	1
they	1
would	1
have	1
stripped	1
off	1
his	1
stockings	1
if	1
his	1
greaves	1
had	1
not	1
prevented	1
them.	1
From	1
Sancho	1
they	1
took	1
his	1
coat,	1
leaving	1
him	1
in	1
his	1
shirt-sleeves;	1
and	1
dividing	1
among	1
themselves	1
the	1
remaining	1
spoils	1
of	1
the	1
battle,	1
they	1
went	1
each	1
one	1
his	1
own	1
way,	1
more	1
solicitous	1
about	1
keeping	1
clear	1
of	1
the	1
Holy	1
Brotherhood	1
they	1
dreaded,	1
than	1
about	1
burdening	1
themselves	1
with	1
the	1
chain,	1
or	1
going	1
to	1
present	1
themselves	1
before	1
the	1
lady	1
Dulcinea	1
del	1
Toboso.	1
The	1
ass	1
and	1
Rocinante,	1
Sancho	1
and	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
were	1
all	1
that	1
were	1
left	1
upon	1
the	1
spot;	1
the	1
ass	1
with	1
drooping	1
head,	1
serious,	1
shaking	1
his	1
ears	1
from	1
time	1
to	1
time	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
thought	1
the	1
storm	1
of	1
stones	1
that	1
assailed	1
them	1
was	1
not	1
yet	1
over;	1
Rocinante	1
stretched	1
beside	1
his	1
master,	1
for	1
he	1
too	1
had	1
been	1
brought	1
to	1
the	1
ground	1
by	1
a	1
stone;	1
Sancho	1
stripped,	1
and	1
trembling	1
with	1
fear	1
of	1
the	1
Holy	1
Brotherhood;	1
and	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
fuming	1
to	1
find	1
himself	1
so	1
served	1
by	1
the	1
very	1
persons	1
for	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
done	1

Seeing	1
himself	1
served	1
in	1
this	1
way,	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
said	1
to	1
his	1
squire,	1
“I	1
have	1
always	1
heard	1
it	1
said,	1
Sancho,	1
that	1
to	1
do	1
good	1
to	1
boors	1
is	1
to	1
throw	1
water	1
into	1
the	1
sea.	1
If	1
I	1
had	1
believed	1
thy	1
words,	1
I	1
should	1
have	1
avoided	1
this	1
trouble;	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
done	1
now,	1
it	1
is	1
only	1
to	1
have	1
patience	1
and	1
take	1
warning	1
for	1
the	1
future.”	1

“Your	1
worship	1
will	1
take	1
warning	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
Turk,”	1
returned	1
Sancho;	1
“but,	1
as	1
you	1
say	1
this	1
mischief	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
avoided	1
if	1
you	1
had	1
believed	1
me,	1
believe	1
me	1
now,	1
and	1
a	1
still	1
greater	1
one	1
will	1
be	1
avoided;	1
for	1
I	1
tell	1
you	1
chivalry	1
is	1
of	1
no	1
account	1
with	1
the	1
Holy	1
Brotherhood,	1
and	1
they	1
don’t	1
care	1
two	1
maravedis	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
knights-errant	1
in	1
the	1
world;	1
and	1
I	1
can	1
tell	1
you	1
I	1
fancy	1
I	1
hear	1
their	1
arrows	1
whistling	1
past	1
my	1
ears	1
this	1
minute.”	1
“Thou	1
art	1
a	1
coward	1
by	1
nature,	1
Sancho,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“but	1
lest	1
thou	1
shouldst	1
say	1
I	1
am	1
obstinate,	1
and	1
that	1
I	1
never	1
do	1
as	1
thou	1
dost	1
advise,	1
this	1
once	1
I	1
will	1
take	1
thy	1
advice,	1
and	1
withdraw	1
out	1
of	1
reach	1
of	1
that	1
fury	1
thou	1
so	1
dreadest;	1
but	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
on	1
one	1
condition,	1
that	1
never,	1
in	1
life	1
or	1
in	1
death,	1
thou	1
art	1
to	1
say	1
to	1
anyone	1
that	1
I	1
retired	1
or	1
withdrew	1
from	1
this	1
danger	1
out	1
of	1
fear,	1
but	1
only	1
in	1
compliance	1
with	1
thy	1
entreaties;	1
for	1
if	1
thou	1
sayest	1
otherwise	1
thou	1
wilt	1
lie	1
therein,	1
and	1
from	1
this	1
time	1
to	1
that,	1
and	1
from	1
that	1
to	1
this,	1
I	1
give	1
thee	1
lie,	1
and	1
say	1
thou	1
liest	1
and	1
wilt	1
lie	1
every	1
time	1
thou	1
thinkest	1
or	1
sayest	1
it;	1
and	1
answer	1
me	1
not	1
again;	1
for	1
at	1
the	1
mere	1
thought	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
withdrawing	1
or	1
retiring	1
from	1
any	1
danger,	1
above	1
all	1
from	1
this,	1
which	1
does	1
seem	1
to	1
carry	1
some	1
little	1
shadow	1
of	1
fear	1
with	1
it,	1
I	1
am	1
ready	1
to	1
take	1
my	1
stand	1
here	1
and	1
await	1
alone,	1
not	1
only	1
that	1
Holy	1
Brotherhood	1
you	1
talk	1
of	1
and	1
dread,	1
but	1
the	1
brothers	1
of	1
the	1
twelve	1
tribes	1
of	1
Israel,	1
and	1
the	1
Seven	1
Maccabees,	1
and	1
Castor	1
and	1
Pollux,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
brothers	1
and	1
brotherhoods	1
in	1
the	1
world.”	1
“Señor,”	1
replied	1
Sancho,	1
“to	1
retire	1
is	1
not	1
to	1
flee,	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
wisdom	1
in	1
waiting	1
when	1
danger	1
outweighs	1
hope,	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
part	1
of	1
wise	1
men	1
to	1
preserve	1
themselves	1
to-day	1
for	1
to-morrow,	1
and	1
not	1
risk	1
all	1
in	1
one	1
day;	1
and	1
let	1
me	1
tell	1
you,	1
though	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
clown	1
and	1
a	1
boor,	1
I	1
have	1
got	1
some	1
notion	1
of	1
what	1
they	1
call	1
safe	1
conduct;	1
so	1
repent	1
not	1
of	1
having	1
taken	1
my	1
advice,	1
but	1
mount	1
Rocinante	1
if	1
you	1
can,	1
and	1
if	1
not	1
I	1
will	1
help	1
you;	1
and	1
follow	1
me,	1
for	1
my	1
mother-wit	1
tells	1
me	1
we	1
have	1
more	1
need	1
of	1
legs	1
than	1
hands	1
just	1
now.”	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
mounted	1
without	1
replying,	1
and,	1
Sancho	1
leading	1
the	1
way	1
on	1
his	1
ass,	1
they	1
entered	1
the	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
Sierra	1
Morena,	1
which	1
was	1
close	1
by,	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
Sancho’s	1
design	1
to	1
cross	1
it	1
entirely	1
and	1
come	1
out	1
again	1
at	1
El	1
Viso	1
or	1
Almodóvar	1
del	1
Campo,	1
and	1
hide	1
for	1
some	1
days	1
among	1
its	1
crags	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
escape	1
the	1
search	1
of	1
the	1
Brotherhood	1
should	1
they	1
come	1
to	1
look	1
for	1
them.	1
He	1
was	1
encouraged	1
in	1
this	1
by	1
perceiving	1
that	1
the	1
stock	1
of	1
provisions	1
carried	1
by	1
the	1
ass	1
had	1
come	1
safe	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
fray	1
with	1
the	1
galley	1
slaves,	1
a	1
circumstance	1
that	1
he	1
regarded	1
as	1
a	1
miracle,	1
seeing	1
how	1
they	1
pillaged	1
and	1
ransacked.	1

That	1
night	1
they	1
reached	1
the	1
very	1
heart	1
of	1
the	1
Sierra	1
Morena,	1
where	1
it	1
seemed	1
prudent	1
to	1
Sancho	1
to	1
pass	1
the	1
night	1
and	1
even	1
some	1
days,	1
at	1
least	1
as	1
many	1
as	1
the	1
stores	1
he	1
carried	1
might	1
last,	1
and	1
so	1
they	1
encamped	1
between	1
two	1
rocks	1
and	1
among	1
some	1
cork	1
trees;	1
but	1
fatal	1
destiny,	1
which,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
opinion	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
have	1
not	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
the	1
true	1
faith,	1
directs,	1
arranges,	1
and	1
settles	1
everything	1
in	1
its	1
own	1
way,	1
so	1
ordered	1
it	1
that	1
Gines	1
de	1
Pasamonte,	1
the	1
famous	1
knave	1
and	1
thief	1
who	1
by	1
the	1
virtue	1
and	1
madness	1
of	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
had	1
been	1
released	1
from	1
the	1
chain,	1
driven	1
by	1
fear	1
of	1
the	1
Holy	1
Brotherhood,	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
good	1
reason	1
to	1
dread,	1
resolved	1
to	1
take	1
hiding	1
in	1
the	1
mountains;	1
and	1
his	1
fate	1
and	1
fear	1
led	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
same	1
spot	1
to	1
which	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
and	1
Sancho	1
Panza	1
had	1
been	1
led	1
by	1
theirs,	1
just	1
in	1
time	1
to	1
recognise	1
them	1
and	1
leave	1
them	1
to	1
fall	1
asleep:	1
and	1
as	1
the	1
wicked	1
are	1
always	1
ungrateful,	1
and	1
necessity	1
leads	1
to	1
evildoing,	1
and	1
immediate	1
advantage	1
overcomes	1
all	1
considerations	1
of	1
the	1
future,	1
Gines,	1
who	1
was	1
neither	1
grateful	1
nor	1
well-principled,	1
made	1
up	1
his	1
mind	1
to	1
steal	1
Sancho	1
Panza’s	1
ass,	1
not	1
troubling	1
himself	1
about	1
Rocinante,	1
as	1
being	1
a	1
prize	1
that	1
was	1
no	1
good	1
either	1
to	1
pledge	1
or	1
sell.	1
While	1
Sancho	1
slept	1
he	1
stole	1
his	1
ass,	1
and	1
before	1
day	1
dawned	1
he	1
was	1
far	1
out	1
of	1
reach.	1

Aurora	1
made	1
her	1
appearance	1
bringing	1
gladness	1
to	1
the	1
earth	1
but	1
sadness	1
to	1
Sancho	1
Panza,	1
for	1
he	1
found	1
that	1
his	1
Dapple	1
was	1
missing,	1
and	1
seeing	1
himself	1
bereft	1
of	1
him	1
he	1
began	1
the	1
saddest	1
and	1
most	1
doleful	1
lament	1
in	1
the	1
world,	1
so	1
loud	1
that	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
awoke	1
at	1
his	1
exclamations	1
and	1
heard	1
him	1
saying,	1
“O	1
son	1
of	1
my	1
bowels,	1
born	1
in	1
my	1
very	1
house,	1
my	1
children’s	1
plaything,	1
my	1
wife’s	1
joy,	1
the	1
envy	1
of	1
my	1
neighbours,	1
relief	1
of	1
my	1
burdens,	1
and	1
lastly,	1
half	1
supporter	1
of	1
myself,	1
for	1
with	1
the	1
six-and-twenty	1
maravedis	1
thou	1
didst	1
earn	1
me	1
daily	1
I	1
met	1
half	1
my	1
charges.”	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
when	1
he	1
heard	1
the	1
lament	1
and	1
learned	1
the	1
cause,	1
consoled	1
Sancho	1
with	1
the	1
best	1
arguments	1
he	1
could,	1
entreating	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
patient,	1
and	1
promising	1
to	1
give	1
him	1
a	1
letter	1
of	1
exchange	1
ordering	1
three	1
out	1
of	1
five	1
ass-colts	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
at	1
home	1
to	1
be	1
given	1
to	1
him.	1
Sancho	1
took	1
comfort	1
at	1
this,	1
dried	1
his	1
tears,	1
suppressed	1
his	1
sobs,	1
and	1
returned	1
thanks	1
for	1
the	1
kindness	1
shown	1
him	1
by	1
Don	1
Quixote.	1
He	1
on	1
his	1
part	1
was	1
rejoiced	1
to	1
the	1
heart	1
on	1
entering	1
the	1
mountains,	1
as	1
they	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
just	1
the	1
place	1
for	1
the	1
adventures	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
quest	1
of.	1
They	1
brought	1
back	1
to	1
his	1
memory	1
the	1
marvellous	1
adventures	1
that	1
had	1
befallen	1
knights-errant	1
in	1
like	1
solitudes	1
and	1
wilds,	1
and	1
he	1
went	1
along	1
reflecting	1
on	1
these	1
things,	1
so	1
absorbed	1
and	1
carried	1
away	1
by	1
them	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
no	1
thought	1
for	1
anything	1
else.	1

Nor	1
had	1
Sancho	1
any	1
other	1
care	1
(now	1
that	1
he	1
fancied	1
he	1
was	1
travelling	1
in	1
a	1
safe	1
quarter)	1
than	1
to	1
satisfy	1
his	1
appetite	1
with	1
such	1
remains	1
as	1
were	1
left	1
of	1
the	1
clerical	1
spoils,	1
and	1
so	1
he	1
marched	1
behind	1
his	1
master	1
laden	1
with	1
what	1
Dapple	1
used	1
to	1
carry,	1
emptying	1
the	1
sack	1
and	1
packing	1
his	1
paunch,	1
and	1
so	1
long	1
as	1
he	1
could	1
go	1
that	1
way,	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
given	1
a	1
farthing	1
to	1
meet	1
with	1
another	1
adventure.	1
While	1
so	1
engaged	1
he	1
raised	1
his	1
eyes	1
and	1
saw	1
that	1
his	1
master	1
had	1
halted,	1
and	1
was	1
trying	1
with	1
the	1
point	1
of	1
his	1
pike	1
to	1
lift	1
some	1
bulky	1
object	1
that	1
lay	1
upon	1
the	1
ground,	1
on	1
which	1
he	1
hastened	1
to	1
join	1
him	1
and	1
help	1
him	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
needful,	1
and	1
reached	1
him	1
just	1
as	1
with	1
the	1
point	1
of	1
the	1
pike	1
he	1
was	1
raising	1
a	1
saddle-pad	1
with	1
a	1
valise	1
attached	1
to	1
it,	1
half	1
or	1
rather	1
wholly	1
rotten	1
and	1
torn;	1
but	1
so	1
heavy	1
were	1
they	1
that	1
Sancho	1
had	1
to	1
help	1
to	1
take	1
them	1
up,	1
and	1
his	1
master	1
directed	1
him	1
to	1
see	1
what	1
the	1
valise	1
contained.	1
Sancho	1
did	1
so	1
with	1
great	1
alacrity,	1
and	1
though	1
the	1
valise	1
was	1
secured	1
by	1
a	1
chain	1
and	1
padlock,	1
from	1
its	1
torn	1
and	1
rotten	1
condition	1
he	1
was	1
able	1
to	1
see	1
its	1
contents,	1
which	1
were	1
four	1
shirts	1
of	1
fine	1
holland,	1
and	1
other	1
articles	1
of	1
linen	1
no	1
less	1
curious	1
than	1
clean;	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
handkerchief	1
he	1
found	1
a	1
good	1
lot	1
of	1
gold	1
crowns,	1
and	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
saw	1
them	1
he	1
exclaimed:	1
“Blessed	1
be	1
all	1
Heaven	1
for	1
sending	1
us	1
an	1
adventure	1
that	1
is	1
good	1
for	1
something!”	1
Searching	1
further	1
he	1
found	1
a	1
little	1
memorandum	1
book	1
richly	1
bound;	1
this	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
asked	1
of	1
him,	1
telling	1
him	1
to	1
take	1
the	1
money	1
and	1
keep	1
it	1
for	1
himself.	1
Sancho	1
kissed	1
his	1
hands	1
for	1
the	1
favour,	1
and	1
cleared	1
the	1
valise	1
of	1
its	1
linen,	1
which	1
he	1
stowed	1
away	1
in	1
the	1
provision	1
sack.	1
Considering	1
the	1
whole	1
matter,	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
observed:	1
“It	1
seems	1
to	1
me,	1
Sancho—and	1
it	1
is	1
impossible	1
it	1
can	1
be	1
otherwise—that	1
some	1
strayed	1
traveller	1
must	1
have	1
crossed	1
this	1
sierra	1
and	1
been	1
attacked	1
and	1
slain	1
by	1
footpads,	1
who	1
brought	1
him	1
to	1
this	1
remote	1
spot	1
to	1
bury	1
him.”	1
“That	1
cannot	1
be,”	1
answered	1
Sancho,	1
“because	1
if	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
robbers	1
they	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
left	1
this	1
money.”	1
“Thou	1
art	1
right,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“and	1
I	1
cannot	1
guess	1
or	1
explain	1
what	1
this	1
may	1
mean;	1
but	1
stay;	1
let	1
us	1
see	1
if	1
in	1
this	1
memorandum	1
book	1
there	1
is	1
anything	1
written	1
by	1
which	1
we	1
may	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
trace	1
out	1
or	1
discover	1
what	1
we	1
want	1
to	1
know.”	1
He	1
opened	1
it,	1
and	1
the	1
first	1
thing	1
he	1
found	1
in	1
it,	1
written	1
roughly	1
but	1
in	1
a	1
very	1
good	1
hand,	1
was	1
a	1
sonnet,	1
and	1
reading	1
it	1
aloud	1
that	1
Sancho	1
might	1
hear	1
it,	1
he	1
found	1
that	1
it	1
ran	1
as	1
follows:	1
SONNET	1
Or	1
Love	1
is	1
lacking	1
in	1
intelligence,	1
Or	1
to	1
the	1
height	1
of	1
cruelty	1
attains,	1
Or	1
else	1
it	1
is	1
my	1
doom	1
to	1
suffer	1
pains	1
Beyond	1
the	1
measure	1
due	1
to	1
my	1
offence.	1
But	1
if	1

“There	1
is	1
nothing	1
to	1
be	1
learned	1
from	1
that	1
rhyme,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“unless	1
by	1
that	1
clue	1
there’s	1
in	1
it,	1
one	1
may	1
draw	1
out	1
the	1
ball	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
matter.”	1
“What	1
clue	1
is	1
there?”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote.	1
“I	1
thought	1
your	1
worship	1
spoke	1
of	1
a	1
clue	1
in	1
it,”	1
said	1
Sancho.	1
“I	1
only	1
said	1
Chloe,”	1
replied	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
“and	1
that	1
no	1
doubt,	1
is	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
lady	1
of	1
whom	1
the	1
author	1
of	1
the	1
sonnet	1
complains;	1
and,	1
faith,	1
he	1
must	1
be	1
a	1
tolerable	1
poet,	1
or	1
I	1
know	1
little	1
of	1
the	1
craft.”	1
“Then	1
your	1
worship	1
understands	1
rhyming	1
too?”	1
“And	1
better	1
than	1
thou	1
thinkest,”	1
replied	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“as	1
thou	1
shalt	1
see	1
when	1
thou	1
carriest	1
a	1
letter	1
written	1
in	1
verse	1
from	1
beginning	1
to	1
end	1
to	1
my	1
lady	1
Dulcinea	1
del	1
Toboso,	1
for	1
I	1
would	1
have	1
thee	1
know,	1
Sancho,	1
that	1
all	1
or	1
most	1
of	1
the	1
knights-errant	1
in	1
days	1
of	1
yore	1
were	1
great	1
troubadours	1
and	1
great	1
musicians,	1
for	1
both	1
of	1
these	1
accomplishments,	1
or	1
more	1
properly	1
speaking	1
gifts,	1
are	1
the	1
peculiar	1
property	1
of	1
lovers-errant:	1
true	1
it	1
is	1
that	1
the	1
verses	1
of	1
the	1
knights	1
of	1
old	1
have	1
more	1
spirit	1
than	1
neatness	1
in	1
them.”	1
“Read	1
more,	1
your	1
worship,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“and	1
you	1
will	1
find	1
something	1
that	1
will	1
enlighten	1
us.”	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
turned	1
the	1
page	1
and	1
said,	1
“This	1
is	1
prose	1
and	1
seems	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
letter.”	1
“A	1
correspondence	1
letter,	1
señor?”	1
“From	1
the	1
beginning	1
it	1
seems	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
love	1
letter,”	1
replied	1
Don	1
Quixote.	1
“Then	1
let	1
your	1
worship	1
read	1
it	1
aloud,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“for	1
I	1
am	1
very	1
fond	1
of	1
love	1
matters.”	1
“With	1
all	1
my	1
heart,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
and	1
reading	1
it	1
aloud	1
as	1
Sancho	1
had	1
requested	1
him,	1
he	1
found	1
it	1
ran	1
thus:	1
Thy	1
false	1
promise	1
and	1
my	1
sure	1
misfortune	1
carry	1
me	1
to	1
a	1
place	1
whence	1
the	1
news	1
of	1
my	1
death	1
will	1
reach	1
thy	1
ears	1
before	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
my	1
complaint.	1
Ungrateful	1
one,	1
thou	1
hast	1
rejected	1
me	1
for	1
one	1
more	1
wealthy,	1
but	1
not	1
more	1
worthy;	1
but	1
if	1
virtue	1
were	1
esteemed	1
wealth	1
I	1
should	1
neither	1
envy	1
the	1
fortunes	1
of	1
others	1
nor	1
weep	1
for	1
misfortunes	1
of	1
my	1
own.	1
What	1
thy	1
beauty	1
raised	1
up	1
thy	1
deeds	1
have	1
laid	1
low;	1
by	1
it	1
I	1
believed	1
thee	1
to	1
be	1
an	1
angel,	1
by	1
them	1
I	1
know	1
thou	1
art	1
a	1
woman.	1
Peace	1
be	1
with	1
thee	1
who	1
hast	1
sent	1
war	1
to	1
me,	1
and	1
Heaven	1
grant	1
that	1
the	1
deceit	1
of	1
thy	1
husband	1
be	1
ever	1
hidden	1
from	1
thee,	1
so	1
that	1
thou	1
repent	1
not	1
of	1
what	1
thou	1
hast	1
done,	1
and	1
I	1
reap	1
not	1
a	1
revenge	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
have.	1
When	1
he	1
had	1
finished	1
the	1
letter,	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
said,	1
“There	1
is	1
less	1
to	1
be	1
gathered	1
from	1
this	1
than	1
from	1
the	1
verses,	1
except	1
that	1
he	1
who	1
wrote	1
it	1
is	1
some	1
rejected	1
lover;”	1
and	1
turning	1
over	1
nearly	1
all	1
the	1
pages	1
of	1
the	1
book	1
he	1
found	1
more	1
verses	1
and	1
letters,	1
some	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
could	1
read,	1
while	1
others	1
he	1
could	1
not;	1
but	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
made	1
up	1
of	1
complaints,	1
laments,	1
misgivings,	1
desires	1
and	1
aversions,	1
favours	1
and	1
rejections,	1
some	1
rapturous,	1
some	1
doleful.	1
While	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
examined	1
the	1
book,	1
Sancho	1
examined	1
the	1
valise,	1
not	1
leaving	1
a	1
corner	1
in	1
the	1
whole	1
of	1
it	1
or	1
in	1
the	1
pad	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
search,	1
peer	1
into,	1
and	1
explore,	1
or	1
seam	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
rip,	1
or	1
tuft	1
of	1
wool	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
pick	1
to	1
pieces,	1
lest	1
anything	1
should	1
escape	1
for	1
want	1
of	1
care	1
and	1
pains;	1
so	1
keen	1
was	1
the	1
covetousness	1
excited	1
in	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
discovery	1
of	1
the	1
crowns,	1
which	1
amounted	1
to	1
near	1
a	1
hundred;	1
and	1
though	1
he	1
found	1
no	1
more	1
booty,	1
he	1
held	1
the	1
blanket	1
flights,	1
balsam	1
vomits,	1
stake	1
benedictions,	1
carriers’	1
fisticuffs,	1
missing	1
alforjas,	1
stolen	1
coat,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
hunger,	1
thirst,	1
and	1
weariness	1
he	1
had	1
endured	1
in	1
the	1
service	1
of	1
his	1
good	1
master,	1
cheap	1
at	1
the	1
price;	1
as	1
he	1
considered	1
himself	1
more	1
than	1
fully	1
indemnified	1
for	1
all	1
by	1
the	1
payment	1
he	1
received	1
in	1
the	1
gift	1
of	1
the	1
treasure-trove.	1
The	1
Knight	1
of	1
the	1
Rueful	1
Countenance	1
was	1
still	1
very	1
anxious	1
to	1
find	1
out	1
who	1
the	1
owner	1
of	1
the	1
valise	1
could	1
be,	1
conjecturing	1
from	1
the	1
sonnet	1
and	1
letter,	1
from	1
the	1
money	1
in	1
gold,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
fineness	1
of	1
the	1
shirts,	1
that	1
he	1
must	1
be	1
some	1
lover	1
of	1
distinction	1
whom	1
the	1
scorn	1
and	1
cruelty	1
of	1
his	1
lady	1
had	1
driven	1
to	1
some	1
desperate	1
course;	1
but	1
as	1
in	1
that	1
uninhabited	1
and	1
rugged	1
spot	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
one	1
to	1
be	1
seen	1
of	1
whom	1
he	1
could	1
inquire,	1
he	1
saw	1
nothing	1
else	1
for	1
it	1
but	1
to	1
push	1
on,	1
taking	1
whatever	1
road	1
Rocinante	1
chose—which	1
was	1
where	1
he	1
could	1
make	1
his	1
way—firmly	1
persuaded	1
that	1
among	1
these	1
wilds	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
fail	1
to	1
meet	1
some	1
rare	1
adventure.	1
As	1
he	1
went	1
along,	1
then,	1
occupied	1
with	1
these	1
thoughts,	1
he	1
perceived	1
on	1
the	1
summit	1
of	1
a	1
height	1
that	1
rose	1
before	1
their	1
eyes	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
went	1
springing	1
from	1
rock	1
to	1
rock	1
and	1
from	1
tussock	1
to	1
tussock	1
with	1
marvellous	1
agility.	1
As	1
well	1
as	1
he	1
could	1
make	1
out	1
he	1
was	1
unclad,	1
with	1
a	1
thick	1
black	1
beard,	1
long	1
tangled	1
hair,	1
and	1
bare	1
legs	1
and	1
feet,	1
his	1
thighs	1
were	1
covered	1
by	1
breeches	1
apparently	1
of	1
tawny	1
velvet	1
but	1
so	1
ragged	1
that	1
they	1
showed	1
his	1
skin	1
in	1
several	1
places.	1

He	1
was	1
bareheaded,	1
and	1
notwithstanding	1
the	1
swiftness	1
with	1
which	1
he	1
passed	1
as	1
has	1
been	1
described,	1
the	1
Knight	1
of	1
the	1
Rueful	1
Countenance	1
observed	1
and	1
noted	1
all	1
these	1
trifles,	1
and	1
though	1
he	1
made	1
the	1
attempt,	1
he	1
was	1
unable	1
to	1
follow	1
him,	1
for	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
granted	1
to	1
the	1
feebleness	1
of	1
Rocinante	1
to	1
make	1
way	1
over	1
such	1
rough	1
ground,	1
he	1
being,	1
moreover,	1
slow-paced	1
and	1
sluggish	1
by	1
nature.	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
at	1
once	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
conclusion	1
that	1
this	1
was	1
the	1
owner	1
of	1
the	1
saddle-pad	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
valise,	1
and	1
made	1
up	1
his	1
mind	1
to	1
go	1
in	1
search	1
of	1
him,	1
even	1
though	1
he	1
should	1
have	1
to	1
wander	1
a	1
year	1
in	1
those	1
mountains	1
before	1
he	1
found	1
him,	1
and	1
so	1
he	1
directed	1
Sancho	1
to	1
take	1
a	1
short	1
cut	1
over	1
one	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
mountain,	1
while	1
he	1
himself	1
went	1
by	1
the	1
other,	1
and	1
perhaps	1
by	1
this	1
means	1
they	1
might	1
light	1
upon	1
this	1
man	1
who	1
had	1
passed	1
so	1
quickly	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
sight.	1
“I	1
could	1
not	1
do	1
that,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“for	1
when	1
I	1
separate	1
from	1
your	1
worship	1
fear	1
at	1
once	1
lays	1
hold	1
of	1
me,	1
and	1
assails	1
me	1
with	1
all	1
sorts	1
of	1
panics	1
and	1
fancies;	1
and	1
let	1
what	1
I	1
now	1
say	1
be	1
a	1
notice	1
that	1
from	1
this	1
time	1
forth	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
going	1
to	1
stir	1
a	1
finger’s	1
width	1
from	1
your	1
presence.”	1
“It	1
shall	1
be	1
so,”	1
said	1
he	1
of	1
the	1
Rueful	1
Countenance,	1
“and	1
I	1
am	1
very	1
glad	1
that	1
thou	1
art	1
willing	1
to	1
rely	1
on	1
my	1
courage,	1
which	1
will	1
never	1
fail	1
thee,	1
even	1
though	1
the	1
soul	1
in	1
thy	1
body	1
fail	1
thee;	1
so	1
come	1
on	1
now	1
behind	1
me	1
slowly	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
thou	1
canst,	1
and	1
make	1
lanterns	1
of	1
thine	1
eyes;	1
let	1
us	1
make	1
the	1
circuit	1
of	1
this	1
ridge;	1
perhaps	1
we	1
shall	1
light	1
upon	1
this	1
man	1
that	1
we	1
saw,	1
who	1
no	1
doubt	1
is	1
no	1
other	1
than	1
the	1
owner	1
of	1
what	1
we	1
found.”	1
To	1
which	1
Sancho	1
made	1
answer,	1
“Far	1
better	1
would	1
it	1
be	1
not	1
to	1
look	1
for	1
him,	1
for,	1
if	1
we	1
find	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
happens	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
owner	1
of	1
the	1
money,	1
it	1
is	1
plain	1
I	1
must	1
restore	1
it;	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
better,	1
therefore,	1
that	1
without	1
taking	1
this	1
needless	1
trouble,	1
I	1
should	1
keep	1
possession	1
of	1
it	1
until	1
in	1
some	1
other	1
less	1
meddlesome	1
and	1
officious	1
way	1
the	1
real	1
owner	1
may	1
be	1
discovered;	1
and	1
perhaps	1
that	1
will	1
be	1
when	1
I	1
shall	1
have	1
spent	1
it,	1
and	1
then	1
the	1
king	1
will	1
hold	1
me	1
harmless.”	1
“Thou	1
art	1
wrong	1
there,	1
Sancho,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“for	1
now	1
that	1
we	1
have	1
a	1
suspicion	1
who	1
the	1
owner	1
is,	1
and	1
have	1
him	1
almost	1
before	1
us,	1
we	1
are	1
bound	1
to	1
seek	1
him	1
and	1
make	1
restitution;	1
and	1
if	1
we	1
do	1
not	1
see	1
him,	1
the	1
strong	1
suspicion	1
we	1
have	1
as	1
to	1
his	1
being	1
the	1
owner	1
makes	1
us	1
as	1
guilty	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
were	1
so;	1
and	1
so,	1
friend	1
Sancho,	1
let	1
not	1
our	1
search	1
for	1
him	1
give	1
thee	1
any	1
uneasiness,	1
for	1
if	1
we	1
find	1
him	1
it	1
will	1
relieve	1
mine.”	1
And	1
so	1
saying	1
he	1
gave	1
Rocinante	1
the	1
spur,	1
and	1
Sancho	1
followed	1
him	1
on	1
foot	1
and	1
loaded,	1
and	1
after	1
having	1
partly	1
made	1
the	1
circuit	1
of	1
the	1
mountain	1
they	1
found	1
lying	1
in	1
a	1
ravine,	1
dead	1
and	1
half	1
devoured	1
by	1
dogs	1
and	1
pecked	1
by	1
jackdaws,	1
a	1
mule	1
saddled	1
and	1
bridled,	1
all	1
which	1
still	1
further	1
strengthened	1
their	1
suspicion	1
that	1
he	1
who	1
had	1
fled	1
was	1
the	1
owner	1
of	1
the	1
mule	1
and	1
the	1
saddle-pad.	1

As	1
they	1
stood	1
looking	1
at	1
it	1
they	1
heard	1
a	1
whistle	1
like	1
that	1
of	1
a	1
shepherd	1
watching	1
his	1
flock,	1
and	1
suddenly	1
on	1
their	1
left	1
there	1
appeared	1
a	1
great	1
number	1
of	1
goats	1
and	1
behind	1
them	1
on	1
the	1
summit	1
of	1
the	1
mountain	1
the	1
goatherd	1
in	1
charge	1
of	1
them,	1
a	1
man	1
advanced	1
in	1
years.	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
called	1
aloud	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
begged	1
him	1
to	1
come	1
down	1
to	1
where	1
they	1
stood.	1
He	1
shouted	1
in	1
return,	1
asking	1
what	1
had	1
brought	1
them	1
to	1
that	1
spot,	1
seldom	1
or	1
never	1
trodden	1
except	1
by	1
the	1
feet	1
of	1
goats,	1
or	1
of	1
the	1
wolves	1
and	1
other	1
wild	1
beasts	1
that	1
roamed	1
around.	1
Sancho	1
in	1
return	1
bade	1
him	1
come	1
down,	1
and	1
they	1
would	1
explain	1
all	1
to	1
him.	1
The	1
goatherd	1
descended,	1
and	1
reaching	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
stood,	1
he	1
said,	1
“I	1
will	1
wager	1
you	1
are	1
looking	1
at	1
that	1
hack	1
mule	1
that	1
lies	1
dead	1
in	1
the	1
hollow	1
there,	1
and,	1
faith,	1
it	1
has	1
been	1
lying	1
there	1
now	1
these	1
six	1
months;	1
tell	1
me,	1
have	1
you	1
come	1
upon	1
its	1
master	1
about	1
here?”	1
“We	1
have	1
come	1
upon	1
nobody,”	1
answered	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“nor	1
on	1
anything	1
except	1
a	1
saddle-pad	1
and	1
a	1
little	1
valise	1
that	1
we	1
found	1
not	1
far	1
from	1
this.”	1
“I	1
found	1
it	1
too,”	1
said	1
the	1
goatherd,	1
“but	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
lift	1
it	1
nor	1
go	1
near	1
it	1
for	1
fear	1
of	1
some	1
ill-luck	1
or	1
being	1
charged	1
with	1
theft,	1
for	1
the	1
devil	1
is	1
crafty,	1
and	1
things	1
rise	1
up	1
under	1
one’s	1
feet	1
to	1
make	1
one	1
fall	1
without	1
knowing	1
why	1
or	1
wherefore.”	1
“That’s	1
exactly	1
what	1
I	1
say,”	1
said	1
Sancho;	1
“I	1
found	1
it	1
too,	1
and	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
go	1
within	1
a	1
stone’s	1
throw	1
of	1
it;	1
there	1
I	1
left	1
it,	1
and	1
there	1
it	1
lies	1
just	1
as	1
it	1
was,	1
for	1
I	1
don’t	1
want	1
a	1
dog	1
with	1
a	1
bell.”	1
“Tell	1
me,	1
good	1
man,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“do	1
you	1
know	1
who	1
is	1
the	1
owner	1
of	1
this	1
property?”	1
“All	1
I	1
can	1
tell	1
you,”	1
said	1
the	1
goatherd,	1
“is	1
that	1
about	1
six	1
months	1
ago,	1
more	1
or	1
less,	1
there	1
arrived	1
at	1
a	1
shepherd’s	1
hut	1
three	1
leagues,	1
perhaps,	1
away	1
from	1
this,	1
a	1
youth	1
of	1
well-bred	1
appearance	1
and	1
manners,	1
mounted	1
on	1
that	1
same	1
mule	1
which	1
lies	1
dead	1
here,	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
saddle-pad	1
and	1
valise	1
which	1
you	1
say	1
you	1
found	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
touch.	1
He	1
asked	1
us	1
what	1
part	1
of	1
this	1
sierra	1
was	1
the	1
most	1
rugged	1
and	1
retired;	1
we	1
told	1
him	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
where	1
we	1
now	1
are;	1
and	1
so	1
in	1
truth	1
it	1
is,	1
for	1
if	1
you	1
push	1
on	1
half	1
a	1
league	1
farther,	1
perhaps	1
you	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
find	1
your	1
way	1
out;	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
wondering	1
how	1
you	1
have	1
managed	1
to	1
come	1
here,	1
for	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
road	1
or	1
path	1
that	1
leads	1
to	1
this	1
spot.	1
I	1
say,	1
then,	1
that	1
on	1
hearing	1
our	1
answer	1
the	1
youth	1
turned	1
about	1
and	1
made	1
for	1
the	1
place	1
we	1
pointed	1
out	1
to	1
him,	1
leaving	1
us	1
all	1
charmed	1
with	1
his	1
good	1
looks,	1
and	1
wondering	1
at	1
his	1
question	1
and	1
the	1
haste	1
with	1
which	1
we	1
saw	1
him	1
depart	1
in	1
the	1
direction	1
of	1
the	1
sierra;	1
and	1
after	1
that	1
we	1
saw	1
him	1
no	1
more,	1
until	1
some	1
days	1
afterwards	1
he	1
crossed	1
the	1
path	1
of	1
one	1
of	1
our	1
shepherds,	1
and	1
without	1
saying	1
a	1
word	1
to	1
him,	1
came	1
up	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
gave	1
him	1
several	1
cuffs	1
and	1
kicks,	1
and	1
then	1
turned	1
to	1
the	1
ass	1
with	1
our	1
provisions	1
and	1
took	1
all	1
the	1
bread	1
and	1
cheese	1
it	1
carried,	1
and	1
having	1
done	1
this	1
made	1
off	1
back	1
again	1
into	1
the	1
sierra	1
with	1
extraordinary	1
swiftness.	1
When	1
some	1
of	1
us	1
goatherds	1
learned	1
this	1
we	1
went	1
in	1
search	1
of	1
him	1
for	1
about	1
two	1
days	1
through	1
the	1
most	1
remote	1
portion	1
of	1
this	1
sierra,	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
which	1
we	1
found	1
him	1
lodged	1
in	1
the	1
hollow	1
of	1
a	1
large	1
thick	1
cork	1
tree.	1
He	1
came	1
out	1
to	1
meet	1
us	1
with	1
great	1
gentleness,	1
with	1
his	1
dress	1
now	1
torn	1
and	1
his	1
face	1
so	1
disfigured	1
and	1
burned	1
by	1
the	1
sun,	1
that	1
we	1
hardly	1
recognised	1
him	1
but	1
that	1
his	1
clothes,	1
though	1
torn,	1
convinced	1
us,	1
from	1
the	1
recollection	1
we	1
had	1
of	1
them,	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
the	1
person	1
we	1
were	1
looking	1
for.	1
He	1
saluted	1
us	1
courteously,	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
few	1
well-spoken	1
words	1
he	1
told	1
us	1
not	1
to	1
wonder	1
at	1
seeing	1
him	1
going	1
about	1
in	1
this	1
guise,	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
binding	1
upon	1
him	1
in	1
order	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
work	1
out	1
a	1
penance	1
which	1
for	1
his	1
many	1
sins	1
had	1
been	1
imposed	1
upon	1
him.	1
We	1
asked	1
him	1
to	1
tell	1
us	1
who	1
he	1
was,	1
but	1
we	1
were	1
never	1
able	1
to	1
find	1
out	1
from	1
him:	1
we	1
begged	1
of	1
him	1
too,	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
want	1
of	1
food,	1
which	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
do	1
without,	1
to	1
tell	1
us	1
where	1
we	1
should	1
find	1
him,	1
as	1
we	1
would	1
bring	1
it	1
to	1
him	1
with	1
all	1
good-will	1
and	1
readiness;	1
or	1
if	1
this	1
were	1
not	1
to	1
his	1
taste,	1
at	1
least	1
to	1
come	1
and	1
ask	1
it	1
of	1
us	1
and	1
not	1
take	1
it	1
by	1
force	1
from	1
the	1
shepherds.	1
He	1
thanked	1
us	1
for	1
the	1
offer,	1
begged	1
pardon	1
for	1
the	1
late	1
assault,	1
and	1
promised	1
for	1
the	1
future	1
to	1
ask	1
it	1
in	1
God’s	1
name	1
without	1
offering	1
violence	1
to	1
anybody.	1
As	1
for	1
fixed	1
abode,	1
he	1
said	1
he	1
had	1
no	1
other	1
than	1
that	1
which	1
chance	1
offered	1
wherever	1
night	1
might	1
overtake	1
him;	1
and	1
his	1
words	1
ended	1
in	1
an	1
outburst	1
of	1
weeping	1
so	1
bitter	1
that	1
we	1
who	1
listened	1
to	1
him	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
very	1
stones	1
had	1
we	1
not	1
joined	1
him	1
in	1
it,	1
comparing	1
what	1
we	1
saw	1
of	1
him	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
with	1
what	1
we	1
saw	1
now;	1
for,	1
as	1
I	1
said,	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
graceful	1
and	1
gracious	1
youth,	1
and	1
in	1
his	1
courteous	1
and	1
polished	1
language	1
showed	1
himself	1
to	1
be	1
of	1
good	1
birth	1
and	1
courtly	1
breeding,	1
and	1
rustics	1
as	1
we	1
were	1
that	1
listened	1
to	1
him,	1
even	1
to	1
our	1
rusticity	1
his	1
gentle	1
bearing	1
sufficed	1
to	1
make	1
it	1
plain.	1
“But	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
his	1
conversation	1
he	1
stopped	1
and	1
became	1
silent,	1
keeping	1
his	1
eyes	1
fixed	1
upon	1
the	1
ground	1
for	1
some	1
time,	1
during	1
which	1
we	1
stood	1
still	1
waiting	1
anxiously	1
to	1
see	1
what	1
would	1
come	1
of	1
this	1
abstraction;	1
and	1
with	1
no	1
little	1
pity,	1
for	1
from	1
his	1
behaviour,	1
now	1
staring	1
at	1
the	1
ground	1
with	1
fixed	1
gaze	1
and	1
eyes	1
wide	1
open	1
without	1
moving	1
an	1
eyelid,	1
again	1
closing	1
them,	1
compressing	1
his	1
lips	1
and	1
raising	1
his	1
eyebrows,	1
we	1
could	1
perceive	1
plainly	1
that	1
a	1
fit	1
of	1
madness	1
of	1
some	1
kind	1
had	1
come	1
upon	1
him;	1
and	1
before	1
long	1
he	1
showed	1
that	1
what	1
we	1
imagined	1
was	1
the	1
truth,	1
for	1
he	1
arose	1
in	1
a	1
fury	1
from	1
the	1
ground	1
where	1
he	1
had	1
thrown	1
himself,	1
and	1
attacked	1
the	1
first	1
he	1
found	1
near	1
him	1
with	1
such	1
rage	1
and	1
fierceness	1
that	1
if	1
we	1
had	1
not	1
dragged	1
him	1
off	1
him,	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
beaten	1
or	1
bitten	1
him	1
to	1
death,	1
all	1
the	1
while	1
exclaiming,	1
‘Oh	1
faithless	1
Fernando,	1
here,	1
here	1
shalt	1
thou	1
pay	1
the	1
penalty	1
of	1
the	1
wrong	1
thou	1
hast	1
done	1
me;	1
these	1
hands	1
shall	1
tear	1
out	1
that	1
heart	1
of	1
thine,	1
abode	1
and	1
dwelling	1
of	1
all	1
iniquity,	1
but	1
of	1
deceit	1
and	1
fraud	1
above	1
all;	1
and	1
to	1
these	1
he	1
added	1
other	1
words	1
all	1
in	1
effect	1
upbraiding	1
this	1
Fernando	1
and	1
charging	1
him	1
with	1
treachery	1
and	1
faithlessness.	1
“We	1
forced	1
him	1
to	1
release	1
his	1
hold	1
with	1
no	1
little	1
difficulty,	1
and	1
without	1
another	1
word	1
he	1
left	1
us,	1
and	1
rushing	1
off	1
plunged	1
in	1
among	1
these	1
brakes	1
and	1
brambles,	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
make	1
it	1
impossible	1
for	1
us	1
to	1
follow	1
him;	1
from	1
this	1
we	1
suppose	1
that	1
madness	1
comes	1
upon	1
him	1
from	1
time	1
to	1
time,	1
and	1
that	1
someone	1
called	1
Fernando	1
must	1
have	1
done	1
him	1
a	1
wrong	1
of	1
a	1
grievous	1
nature	1
such	1
as	1
the	1
condition	1
to	1
which	1
it	1
had	1
brought	1
him	1
seemed	1
to	1
show.	1
All	1
this	1
has	1
been	1
since	1
then	1
confirmed	1
on	1
those	1
occasions,	1
and	1
they	1
have	1
been	1
many,	1
on	1
which	1
he	1
has	1
crossed	1
our	1
path,	1
at	1
one	1
time	1
to	1
beg	1
the	1
shepherds	1
to	1
give	1
him	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
food	1
they	1
carry,	1
at	1
another	1
to	1
take	1
it	1
from	1
them	1
by	1
force;	1
for	1
when	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
fit	1
of	1
madness	1
upon	1
him,	1
even	1
though	1
the	1
shepherds	1
offer	1
it	1
freely,	1
he	1
will	1
not	1
accept	1
it	1
but	1
snatches	1
it	1
from	1
them	1
by	1
dint	1
of	1
blows;	1
but	1
when	1
he	1
is	1
in	1
his	1
senses	1
he	1
begs	1
it	1
for	1
the	1
love	1
of	1
God,	1
courteously	1
and	1
civilly,	1
and	1
receives	1
it	1
with	1
many	1
thanks	1
and	1
not	1
a	1
few	1
tears.	1
And	1
to	1
tell	1
you	1
the	1
truth,	1
sirs,”	1
continued	1
the	1
goatherd,	1
“it	1
was	1
yesterday	1
that	1
we	1
resolved,	1
I	1
and	1
four	1
of	1
the	1
lads,	1
two	1
of	1
them	1
our	1
servants,	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
two	1
friends	1
of	1
mine,	1
to	1
go	1
in	1
search	1
of	1
him	1
until	1
we	1
find	1
him,	1
and	1
when	1
we	1
do	1
to	1
take	1
him,	1
whether	1
by	1
force	1
or	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
consent,	1
to	1
the	1
town	1
of	1
Almodóvar,	1
which	1
is	1
eight	1
leagues	1
from	1
this,	1
and	1
there	1
strive	1
to	1
cure	1
him	1
(if	1
indeed	1
his	1
malady	1
admits	1
of	1
a	1
cure),	1
or	1
learn	1
when	1
he	1
is	1
in	1
his	1
senses	1
who	1
he	1
is,	1
and	1
if	1
he	1
has	1
relatives	1
to	1
whom	1
we	1
may	1
give	1
notice	1
of	1
his	1
misfortune.	1
This,	1
sirs,	1
is	1
all	1
I	1
can	1
say	1
in	1
answer	1
to	1
what	1
you	1
have	1
asked	1
me;	1
and	1
be	1
sure	1
that	1
the	1
owner	1
of	1
the	1
articles	1
you	1
found	1
is	1
he	1
whom	1
you	1
saw	1
pass	1
by	1
with	1
such	1
nimbleness	1
and	1
so	1
naked.”	1
For	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
had	1
already	1
described	1
how	1
he	1
had	1
seen	1
the	1
man	1
go	1
bounding	1
along	1
the	1
mountainside,	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
now	1
filled	1
with	1
amazement	1
at	1
what	1
he	1
heard	1
from	1
the	1
goatherd,	1
and	1
more	1
eager	1
than	1
ever	1
to	1
discover	1
who	1
the	1
unhappy	1
madman	1
was;	1
and	1
in	1
his	1
heart	1
he	1
resolved,	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
before,	1
to	1
search	1
for	1
him	1
all	1
over	1
the	1
mountain,	1
not	1
leaving	1
a	1
corner	1
or	1
cave	1
unexamined	1
until	1
he	1
had	1
found	1
him.	1
But	1
chance	1
arranged	1
matters	1
better	1
than	1
he	1
expected	1
or	1
hoped,	1
for	1
at	1
that	1
very	1
moment,	1
in	1
a	1
gorge	1
on	1
the	1
mountain	1
that	1
opened	1
where	1
they	1
stood,	1
the	1
youth	1
he	1
wished	1
to	1
find	1
made	1
his	1
appearance,	1
coming	1
along	1
talking	1
to	1
himself	1
in	1
a	1
way	1
that	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
unintelligible	1
near	1
at	1
hand,	1
much	1
more	1
at	1
a	1
distance.	1
His	1
garb	1
was	1
what	1
has	1
been	1
described,	1
save	1
that	1
as	1
he	1
drew	1
near,	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
perceived	1
that	1
a	1
tattered	1
doublet	1
which	1
he	1
wore	1
was	1
amber-tanned,	1
from	1
which	1
he	1
concluded	1
that	1
one	1
who	1
wore	1
such	1
garments	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
of	1
very	1
low	1
rank.	1
Approaching	1
them,	1
the	1
youth	1
greeted	1
them	1
in	1
a	1
harsh	1
and	1
hoarse	1
voice	1
but	1
with	1
great	1
courtesy.	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
returned	1
his	1
salutation	1
with	1
equal	1
politeness,	1
and	1
dismounting	1
from	1
Rocinante	1
advanced	1
with	1
well-bred	1
bearing	1
and	1
grace	1
to	1
embrace	1
him,	1
and	1
held	1
him	1
for	1
some	1
time	1
close	1
in	1
his	1
arms	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
known	1
him	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time.	1
The	1
other,	1
whom	1
we	1
may	1
call	1
the	1
Ragged	1
One	1
of	1
the	1
Sorry	1
Countenance,	1
as	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
was	1
of	1
the	1
Rueful,	1
after	1
submitting	1
to	1
the	1
embrace	1
pushed	1
him	1
back	1
a	1
little	1
and,	1
placing	1
his	1
hands	1
on	1
Don	1
Quixote’s	1
shoulders,	1
stood	1
gazing	1
at	1
him	1
as	1
if	1
seeking	1
to	1
see	1
whether	1
he	1
knew	1
him,	1
not	1
less	1
amazed,	1
perhaps,	1
at	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
face,	1
figure,	1
and	1
armour	1
of	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
than	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
was	1
at	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
him.	1
To	1
be	1
brief,	1
the	1
first	1
to	1
speak	1
after	1
embracing	1
was	1
the	1
Ragged	1

will	1
be	1
told	1
farther	1
on.	1

The	1
history	1
relates	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
with	1
the	1
greatest	1
attention	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
listened	1
to	1
the	1
ragged	1
knight	1
of	1
the	1
Sierra,	1
who	1
began	1
by	1
saying:	1
“Of	1
a	1
surety,	1
señor,	1
whoever	1
you	1
are,	1
for	1
I	1
know	1
you	1
not,	1
I	1
thank	1
you	1
for	1
the	1
proofs	1
of	1
kindness	1
and	1
courtesy	1
you	1
have	1
shown	1
me,	1
and	1
would	1
I	1
were	1
in	1
a	1
condition	1
to	1
requite	1
with	1
something	1
more	1
than	1
good-will	1
that	1
which	1
you	1
have	1
displayed	1
towards	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
cordial	1
reception	1
you	1
have	1
given	1
me;	1
but	1
my	1
fate	1
does	1
not	1
afford	1
me	1
any	1
other	1
means	1
of	1
returning	1
kindnesses	1
done	1
me	1
save	1
the	1
hearty	1
desire	1
to	1
repay	1
them.”	1
“Mine,”	1
replied	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“is	1
to	1
be	1
of	1
service	1
to	1
you,	1
so	1
much	1
so	1
that	1
I	1
had	1
resolved	1
not	1
to	1
quit	1
these	1
mountains	1
until	1
I	1
had	1
found	1
you,	1
and	1
learned	1
of	1
you	1
whether	1
there	1
is	1
any	1
kind	1
of	1
relief	1
to	1
be	1
found	1
for	1
that	1
sorrow	1
under	1
which	1
from	1
the	1
strangeness	1
of	1
your	1
life	1
you	1
seem	1
to	1
labour;	1
and	1
to	1
search	1
for	1
you	1
with	1
all	1
possible	1
diligence,	1
if	1
search	1
had	1
been	1
necessary.	1
And	1
if	1
your	1
misfortune	1
should	1
prove	1
to	1
be	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
that	1
refuse	1
admission	1
to	1
any	1
sort	1
of	1
consolation,	1
it	1
was	1
my	1
purpose	1
to	1
join	1
you	1
in	1
lamenting	1
and	1
mourning	1
over	1
it,	1
so	1
far	1
as	1
I	1
could;	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
still	1
some	1
comfort	1
in	1
misfortune	1
to	1
find	1
one	1
who	1
can	1
feel	1
for	1
it.	1
And	1
if	1
my	1
good	1
intentions	1
deserve	1
to	1
be	1
acknowledged	1
with	1
any	1
kind	1
of	1
courtesy,	1
I	1
entreat	1
you,	1
señor,	1
by	1
that	1
which	1
I	1
perceive	1
you	1
possess	1
in	1
so	1
high	1
a	1
degree,	1
and	1
likewise	1
conjure	1
you	1
by	1
whatever	1
you	1
love	1
or	1
have	1
loved	1
best	1
in	1
life,	1
to	1
tell	1
me	1
who	1
you	1
are	1
and	1
the	1
cause	1
that	1
has	1
brought	1
you	1
to	1
live	1
or	1
die	1
in	1
these	1
solitudes	1
like	1
a	1
brute	1
beast,	1
dwelling	1
among	1
them	1
in	1
a	1
manner	1
so	1
foreign	1
to	1
your	1
condition	1
as	1
your	1
garb	1
and	1
appearance	1
show.	1
And	1
I	1
swear,”	1
added	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“by	1
the	1
order	1
of	1
knighthood	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
received,	1
and	1
by	1
my	1
vocation	1
of	1
knight-errant,	1
if	1
you	1
gratify	1
me	1
in	1
this,	1
to	1
serve	1
you	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
zeal	1
my	1
calling	1
demands	1
of	1
me,	1
either	1
in	1
relieving	1
your	1
misfortune	1
if	1
it	1
admits	1
of	1
relief,	1
or	1
in	1
joining	1
you	1
in	1
lamenting	1
it	1
as	1
I	1
promised	1
to	1
do.”	1
The	1
Knight	1
of	1
the	1
Thicket,	1
hearing	1
him	1
of	1
the	1
Rueful	1
Countenance	1
talk	1
in	1
this	1
strain,	1
did	1
nothing	1
but	1
stare	1
at	1
him,	1
and	1
stare	1
at	1
him	1
again,	1
and	1
again	1
survey	1
him	1
from	1
head	1
to	1
foot;	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
thoroughly	1
examined	1
him,	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
him:	1
“If	1
you	1
have	1
anything	1
to	1
give	1
me	1
to	1
eat,	1
for	1
God’s	1
sake	1
give	1
it	1
me,	1
and	1
after	1
I	1
have	1
eaten	1
I	1
will	1
do	1
all	1
you	1
ask	1
in	1
acknowledgment	1
of	1
the	1
goodwill	1
you	1
have	1
displayed	1
towards	1
me.”	1
Sancho	1
from	1
his	1
sack,	1
and	1
the	1
goatherd	1
from	1
his	1
pouch,	1
furnished	1
the	1
Ragged	1
One	1
with	1
the	1
means	1
of	1
appeasing	1
his	1
hunger,	1
and	1
what	1
they	1
gave	1
him	1
he	1
ate	1
like	1
a	1
half-witted	1
being,	1
so	1
hastily	1
that	1
he	1
took	1
no	1
time	1
between	1
mouthfuls,	1
gorging	1
rather	1
than	1
swallowing;	1
and	1
while	1
he	1
ate	1
neither	1
he	1
nor	1
they	1
who	1
observed	1
him	1
uttered	1
a	1
word.	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
he	1
made	1
signs	1
to	1
them	1
to	1
follow	1
him,	1
which	1
they	1
did,	1
and	1
he	1
led	1
them	1
to	1
a	1
green	1
plot	1
which	1
lay	1
a	1
little	1
farther	1
off	1
round	1
the	1
corner	1
of	1
a	1
rock.	1
On	1
reaching	1
it	1
he	1
stretched	1
himself	1
upon	1
the	1
grass,	1
and	1
the	1
others	1
did	1
the	1
same,	1
all	1
keeping	1
silence,	1
until	1
the	1
Ragged	1
One,	1
settling	1
himself	1
in	1
his	1
place,	1
said:	1
“If	1
it	1
is	1
your	1
wish,	1
sirs,	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
disclose	1
in	1
a	1
few	1
words	1
the	1
surpassing	1
extent	1
of	1
my	1
misfortunes,	1
you	1
must	1
promise	1
not	1
to	1
break	1
the	1
thread	1
of	1
my	1
sad	1
story	1
with	1
any	1
question	1
or	1
other	1
interruption,	1
for	1
the	1
instant	1
you	1
do	1
so	1
the	1
tale	1
I	1
tell	1
will	1
come	1
to	1
an	1
end.”	1
These	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
Ragged	1
One	1
reminded	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
of	1
the	1
tale	1
his	1
squire	1
had	1
told	1
him,	1
when	1
he	1
failed	1
to	1
keep	1
count	1
of	1
the	1
goats	1
that	1
had	1
crossed	1
the	1
river	1
and	1
the	1
story	1
remained	1
unfinished;	1
but	1
to	1
return	1
to	1
the	1
Ragged	1
One,	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
to	1
say:	1
“I	1
give	1
you	1
this	1
warning	1
because	1
I	1
wish	1
to	1
pass	1
briefly	1
over	1
the	1
story	1
of	1
my	1
misfortunes,	1
for	1
recalling	1
them	1
to	1
memory	1
only	1
serves	1
to	1
add	1
fresh	1
ones,	1
and	1
the	1
less	1
you	1
question	1
me	1
the	1
sooner	1
shall	1
I	1
make	1
an	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
recital,	1
though	1
I	1
shall	1
not	1
omit	1
to	1
relate	1
anything	1
of	1
importance	1
in	1
order	1
fully	1
to	1
satisfy	1
your	1
curiosity.”	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
gave	1
the	1
promise	1
for	1
himself	1
and	1
the	1
others,	1
and	1
with	1
this	1
assurance	1
he	1
began	1
as	1
follows:	1
“My	1
name	1
is	1
Cardenio,	1
my	1
birthplace	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
best	1
cities	1
of	1
this	1
Andalusia,	1
my	1
family	1
noble,	1
my	1
parents	1
rich,	1
my	1
misfortune	1
so	1
great	1
that	1
my	1
parents	1
must	1
have	1
wept	1
and	1
my	1
family	1
grieved	1
over	1
it	1
without	1
being	1
able	1
by	1
their	1
wealth	1
to	1
lighten	1
it;	1
for	1
the	1
gifts	1
of	1
fortune	1
can	1
do	1
little	1
to	1
relieve	1
reverses	1
sent	1
by	1
Heaven.	1
In	1
that	1
same	1
country	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
heaven	1
in	1
which	1
love	1
had	1
placed	1
all	1
the	1
glory	1
I	1
could	1
desire;	1
such	1
was	1
the	1
beauty	1
of	1
Luscinda,	1
a	1
damsel	1
as	1
noble	1
and	1
as	1
rich	1
as	1
I,	1
but	1
of	1
happier	1
fortunes,	1
and	1
of	1
less	1
firmness	1
than	1
was	1
due	1
to	1
so	1
worthy	1
a	1
passion	1
as	1
mine.	1
This	1
Luscinda	1
I	1
loved,	1
worshipped,	1
and	1
adored	1
from	1
my	1
earliest	1
and	1
tenderest	1
years,	1
and	1
she	1
loved	1
me	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
innocence	1
and	1
sincerity	1
of	1
childhood.	1
Our	1
parents	1
were	1
aware	1
of	1
our	1
feelings,	1
and	1
were	1
not	1
sorry	1
to	1
perceive	1
them,	1
for	1
they	1
saw	1
clearly	1
that	1
as	1
they	1
ripened	1
they	1
must	1
lead	1
at	1
last	1
to	1
a	1
marriage	1
between	1
us,	1
a	1
thing	1
that	1
seemed	1
almost	1
prearranged	1
by	1
the	1
equality	1
of	1
our	1
families	1
and	1
wealth.	1
We	1
grew	1
up,	1
and	1
with	1
our	1
growth	1
grew	1
the	1
love	1
between	1
us,	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
father	1
of	1
Luscinda	1
felt	1
bound	1
for	1
propriety’s	1
sake	1
to	1
refuse	1
me	1
admission	1
to	1
his	1
house,	1
in	1
this	1
perhaps	1
imitating	1
the	1
parents	1
of	1
that	1
Thisbe	1
so	1
celebrated	1
by	1
the	1
poets,	1
and	1
this	1
refusal	1
but	1
added	1
love	1
to	1
love	1
and	1
flame	1
to	1
flame;	1
for	1
though	1
they	1
enforced	1
silence	1
upon	1
our	1
tongues	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
impose	1
it	1
upon	1
our	1
pens,	1
which	1
can	1
make	1
known	1
the	1
heart’s	1
secrets	1
to	1
a	1
loved	1
one	1
more	1
freely	1
than	1
tongues;	1
for	1
many	1
a	1
time	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
the	1
object	1
of	1
love	1
shakes	1
the	1
firmest	1
will	1
and	1
strikes	1
dumb	1
the	1
boldest	1
tongue.	1
Ah	1
heavens!	1
how	1
many	1
letters	1
did	1
I	1
write	1
her,	1
and	1
how	1
many	1
dainty	1
modest	1
replies	1
did	1
I	1
receive!	1
how	1
many	1
ditties	1
and	1
love-songs	1
did	1
I	1
compose	1
in	1
which	1
my	1
heart	1
declared	1
and	1
made	1
known	1
its	1
feelings,	1
described	1
its	1
ardent	1
longings,	1
revelled	1
in	1
its	1
recollections	1
and	1
dallied	1
with	1
its	1
desires!	1
At	1
length	1
growing	1
impatient	1
and	1
feeling	1
my	1
heart	1
languishing	1
with	1
longing	1
to	1
see	1
her,	1
I	1
resolved	1
to	1
put	1
into	1
execution	1
and	1
carry	1
out	1
what	1
seemed	1
to	1
me	1
the	1
best	1
mode	1
of	1
winning	1
my	1
desired	1
and	1
merited	1
reward,	1
to	1
ask	1
her	1
of	1
her	1
father	1
for	1
my	1
lawful	1
wife,	1
which	1
I	1
did.	1
To	1
this	1
his	1
answer	1
was	1
that	1
he	1
thanked	1
me	1
for	1
the	1
disposition	1
I	1
showed	1
to	1
do	1
honour	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
to	1
regard	1
myself	1
as	1
honoured	1
by	1
the	1
bestowal	1
of	1
his	1
treasure;	1
but	1
that	1
as	1
my	1
father	1
was	1
alive	1
it	1
was	1
his	1
by	1
right	1
to	1
make	1
this	1
demand,	1
for	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
not	1
in	1
accordance	1
with	1
his	1
full	1
will	1
and	1
pleasure,	1
Luscinda	1
was	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
taken	1
or	1
given	1
by	1
stealth.	1
I	1
thanked	1
him	1
for	1
his	1
kindness,	1
reflecting	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
reason	1
in	1
what	1
he	1
said,	1
and	1
that	1
my	1
father	1
would	1
assent	1
to	1
it	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
I	1
should	1
tell	1
him,	1
and	1
with	1
that	1
view	1
I	1
went	1
the	1
very	1
same	1
instant	1
to	1
let	1
him	1
know	1
what	1
my	1
desires	1
were.	1
When	1
I	1
entered	1
the	1
room	1
where	1
he	1
was	1
I	1
found	1
him	1
with	1
an	1
open	1
letter	1
in	1
his	1
hand,	1
which,	1
before	1
I	1
could	1
utter	1
a	1
word,	1
he	1
gave	1
me,	1
saying,	1
‘By	1
this	1
letter	1
thou	1
wilt	1
see,	1
Cardenio,	1
the	1
disposition	1
the	1
Duke	1
Ricardo	1
has	1
to	1
serve	1
thee.’	1
This	1
Duke	1
Ricardo,	1
as	1
you,	1
sirs,	1
probably	1
know	1
already,	1
is	1
a	1
grandee	1
of	1
Spain	1
who	1
has	1
his	1
seat	1
in	1
the	1
best	1
part	1
of	1
this	1
Andalusia.	1
I	1
took	1
and	1
read	1
the	1
letter,	1
which	1
was	1
couched	1
in	1
terms	1
so	1
flattering	1
that	1
even	1
I	1
myself	1
felt	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
wrong	1
in	1
my	1
father	1
not	1
to	1
comply	1
with	1
the	1
request	1
the	1
duke	1
made	1
in	1
it,	1
which	1
was	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
send	1
me	1
immediately	1
to	1
him,	1
as	1
he	1
wished	1
me	1
to	1
become	1
the	1
companion,	1
not	1
servant,	1
of	1
his	1
eldest	1
son,	1
and	1
would	1
take	1
upon	1
himself	1
the	1
charge	1
of	1
placing	1
me	1
in	1
a	1
position	1
corresponding	1
to	1
the	1
esteem	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
held	1
me.	1
On	1
reading	1
the	1
letter	1
my	1
voice	1
failed	1
me,	1
and	1
still	1
more	1
when	1
I	1
heard	1
my	1
father	1
say,	1
‘Two	1
days	1
hence	1
thou	1
wilt	1
depart,	1
Cardenio,	1
in	1
accordance	1
with	1
the	1
duke’s	1
wish,	1
and	1
give	1
thanks	1
to	1
God	1
who	1
is	1
opening	1
a	1
road	1
to	1
thee	1
by	1
which	1
thou	1
mayest	1
attain	1
what	1
I	1
know	1
thou	1
dost	1
deserve;	1
and	1
to	1
these	1
words	1
he	1
added	1
others	1
of	1
fatherly	1
counsel.	1
The	1
time	1
for	1
my	1
departure	1
arrived;	1
I	1
spoke	1
one	1
night	1
to	1
Luscinda,	1
I	1
told	1
her	1
all	1
that	1
had	1
occurred,	1
as	1
I	1
did	1
also	1
to	1
her	1
father,	1
entreating	1
him	1
to	1
allow	1
some	1
delay,	1
and	1
to	1
defer	1
the	1
disposal	1
of	1
her	1
hand	1
until	1
I	1
should	1
see	1
what	1
the	1
Duke	1
Ricardo	1
sought	1
of	1
me:	1
he	1
gave	1
me	1
the	1
promise,	1
and	1
she	1
confirmed	1
it	1
with	1
vows	1
and	1
swoonings	1
unnumbered.	1
Finally,	1
I	1
presented	1
myself	1
to	1
the	1
duke,	1
and	1
was	1
received	1
and	1
treated	1
by	1
him	1
so	1
kindly	1
that	1
very	1
soon	1
envy	1
began	1
to	1
do	1
its	1
work,	1
the	1
old	1
servants	1
growing	1
envious	1
of	1
me,	1
and	1
regarding	1
the	1
duke’s	1
inclination	1
to	1
show	1
me	1
favour	1
as	1
an	1
injury	1
to	1
themselves.	1
But	1
the	1
one	1
to	1
whom	1
my	1
arrival	1
gave	1
the	1
greatest	1
pleasure	1
was	1
the	1
duke’s	1
second	1
son,	1
Fernando	1
by	1
name,	1
a	1
gallant	1
youth,	1
of	1
noble,	1
generous,	1
and	1
amorous	1
disposition,	1
who	1
very	1
soon	1
made	1
so	1
intimate	1
a	1
friend	1
of	1
me	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
remarked	1
by	1
everybody;	1
for	1
though	1
the	1
elder	1
was	1
attached	1
to	1
me,	1
and	1
showed	1
me	1
kindness,	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
carry	1
his	1
affectionate	1
treatment	1
to	1
the	1
same	1
length	1
as	1
Don	1
Fernando.	1
It	1
so	1
happened,	1
then,	1
that	1
as	1
between	1
friends	1
no	1
secret	1
remains	1
unshared,	1
and	1
as	1
the	1
favour	1
I	1
enjoyed	1
with	1
Don	1
Fernando	1
had	1
grown	1
into	1
friendship,	1
he	1
made	1
all	1
his	1
thoughts	1
known	1
to	1
me,	1
and	1
in	1
particular	1
a	1
love	1
affair	1
which	1
troubled	1
his	1
mind	1
a	1
little.	1
He	1
was	1
deeply	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
a	1
peasant	1
girl,	1
a	1
vassal	1
of	1
his	1
father’s,	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
wealthy	1
parents,	1
and	1
herself	1
so	1
beautiful,	1
modest,	1
discreet,	1
and	1
virtuous,	1
that	1
no	1
one	1
who	1
knew	1
her	1
was	1
able	1
to	1
decide	1
in	1
which	1
of	1
these	1
respects	1
she	1
was	1
most	1
highly	1
gifted	1
or	1
most	1
excelled.	1
The	1
attractions	1
of	1
the	1
fair	1
peasant	1
raised	1
the	1
passion	1
of	1
Don	1
Fernando	1
to	1
such	1
a	1
point	1
that,	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
gain	1
his	1
object	1
and	1
overcome	1
her	1
virtuous	1
resolutions,	1
he	1
determined	1
to	1
pledge	1
his	1
word	1
to	1
her	1
to	1
become	1
her	1
husband,	1
for	1
to	1
attempt	1
it	1
in	1
any	1
other	1
way	1
was	1
to	1
attempt	1
an	1
impossibility.	1
Bound	1
to	1
him	1
as	1
I	1
was	1
by	1
friendship,	1
I	1
strove	1
by	1
the	1
best	1
arguments	1
and	1
the	1
most	1
forcible	1
examples	1
I	1
could	1
think	1
of	1
to	1
restrain	1
and	1
dissuade	1
him	1
from	1
such	1
a	1
course;	1
but	1
perceiving	1
I	1
produced	1
no	1
effect	1
I	1
resolved	1
to	1
make	1
the	1
Duke	1
Ricardo,	1
his	1
father,	1
acquainted	1
with	1
the	1
matter;	1
but	1
Don	1
Fernando,	1
being	1
sharp-witted	1
and	1
shrewd,	1
foresaw	1
and	1
apprehended	1
this,	1
perceiving	1
that	1
by	1
my	1
duty	1
as	1
a	1
good	1
servant	1
I	1
was	1
bound	1
not	1
to	1
keep	1
concealed	1
a	1
thing	1
so	1
much	1
opposed	1
to	1
the	1
honour	1
of	1
my	1
lord	1
the	1
duke;	1
and	1
so,	1
to	1
mislead	1
and	1
deceive	1
me,	1
he	1
told	1
me	1
he	1
could	1
find	1
no	1
better	1
way	1
of	1
effacing	1
from	1
his	1
mind	1
the	1
beauty	1
that	1
so	1
enslaved	1
him	1
than	1
by	1
absenting	1
himself	1
for	1
some	1
months,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
wished	1
the	1
absence	1
to	1
be	1
effected	1
by	1
our	1
going,	1
both	1
of	1
us,	1
to	1
my	1
father’s	1
house	1
under	1
the	1
pretence,	1
which	1
he	1
would	1
make	1
to	1
the	1
duke,	1
of	1
going	1
to	1
see	1
and	1
buy	1
some	1
fine	1
horses	1
that	1
there	1
were	1
in	1
my	1
city,	1
which	1
produces	1
the	1
best	1
in	1
the	1
world.	1
When	1
I	1
heard	1
him	1
say	1
so,	1
even	1
if	1
his	1
resolution	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
so	1
good	1
a	1
one	1
I	1
should	1
have	1
hailed	1
it	1
as	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
happiest	1
that	1
could	1
be	1
imagined,	1
prompted	1
by	1
my	1
affection,	1
seeing	1
what	1
a	1
favourable	1
chance	1
and	1
opportunity	1
it	1
offered	1
me	1
of	1
returning	1
to	1
see	1
my	1
Luscinda.	1
With	1
this	1
thought	1
and	1
wish	1
I	1
commended	1
his	1
idea	1
and	1
encouraged	1
his	1
design,	1
advising	1
him	1
to	1
put	1
it	1
into	1
execution	1
as	1
quickly	1
as	1
possible,	1
as,	1
in	1
truth,	1
absence	1
produced	1
its	1
effect	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
deeply	1
rooted	1
feelings.	1
But,	1
as	1
afterwards	1
appeared,	1
when	1
he	1
said	1
this	1
to	1
me	1
he	1
had	1
already	1
enjoyed	1
the	1
peasant	1
girl	1
under	1
the	1
title	1
of	1
husband,	1
and	1
was	1
waiting	1
for	1
an	1
opportunity	1
of	1
making	1
it	1
known	1
with	1
safety	1
to	1
himself,	1
being	1
in	1
dread	1
of	1
what	1
his	1
father	1
the	1
duke	1
would	1
do	1
when	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
know	1
of	1
his	1
folly.	1
It	1
happened,	1
then,	1
that	1
as	1
with	1
young	1
men	1
love	1
is	1
for	1
the	1
most	1
part	1
nothing	1
more	1
than	1
appetite,	1
which,	1
as	1
its	1
final	1
object	1
is	1
enjoyment,	1
comes	1
to	1
an	1
end	1
on	1
obtaining	1
it,	1
and	1
that	1
which	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
love	1
takes	1
to	1
flight,	1
as	1
it	1
cannot	1
pass	1
the	1
limit	1
fixed	1
by	1
nature,	1
which	1
fixes	1
no	1
limit	1
to	1
true	1
love—what	1
I	1
mean	1
is	1
that	1
after	1
Don	1
Fernando	1
had	1
enjoyed	1
this	1
peasant	1
girl	1
his	1
passion	1
subsided	1
and	1
his	1
eagerness	1
cooled,	1
and	1
if	1
at	1
first	1
he	1
feigned	1
a	1
wish	1
to	1
absent	1
himself	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
cure	1
his	1
love,	1
he	1
was	1
now	1
in	1
reality	1
anxious	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
avoid	1
keeping	1
his	1
promise.	1
“The	1
duke	1
gave	1
him	1
permission,	1
and	1
ordered	1
me	1
to	1
accompany	1
him;	1
we	1
arrived	1
at	1
my	1
city,	1
and	1
my	1
father	1
gave	1
him	1
the	1
reception	1
due	1
to	1
his	1
rank;	1
I	1
saw	1
Luscinda	1
without	1
delay,	1
and,	1
though	1
it	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
dead	1
or	1
deadened,	1
my	1
love	1
gathered	1
fresh	1
life.	1
To	1
my	1
sorrow	1
I	1
told	1
the	1
story	1
of	1
it	1
to	1
Don	1
Fernando,	1
for	1
I	1
thought	1
that	1
in	1
virtue	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
friendship	1
he	1
bore	1
me	1
I	1
was	1
bound	1
to	1
conceal	1
nothing	1
from	1
him.	1
I	1
extolled	1
her	1
beauty,	1
her	1
gaiety,	1
her	1
wit,	1
so	1
warmly,	1
that	1
my	1
praises	1
excited	1
in	1
him	1
a	1
desire	1
to	1
see	1
a	1
damsel	1
adorned	1
by	1
such	1
attractions.	1
To	1
my	1
misfortune	1
I	1
yielded	1
to	1
it,	1
showing	1
her	1
to	1
him	1
one	1
night	1
by	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
a	1
taper	1
at	1
a	1
window	1
where	1
we	1
used	1
to	1
talk	1
to	1
one	1
another.	1
As	1
she	1
appeared	1
to	1
him	1
in	1
her	1
dressing-gown,	1
she	1
drove	1
all	1
the	1
beauties	1
he	1
had	1
seen	1
until	1
then	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
recollection;	1
speech	1
failed	1
him,	1
his	1
head	1
turned,	1
he	1
was	1
spell-bound,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
end	1
love-smitten,	1
as	1
you	1
will	1
see	1
in	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
the	1
story	1
of	1
my	1
misfortune;	1
and	1
to	1
inflame	1
still	1
further	1
his	1
passion,	1
which	1
he	1
hid	1
from	1
me	1
and	1
revealed	1
to	1
Heaven	1
alone,	1
it	1
so	1
happened	1
that	1
one	1
day	1
he	1
found	1
a	1
note	1
of	1
hers	1
entreating	1
me	1
to	1
demand	1
her	1
of	1
her	1
father	1
in	1
marriage,	1
so	1
delicate,	1
so	1
modest,	1
and	1
so	1
tender,	1
that	1
on	1
reading	1
it	1
he	1
told	1
me	1
that	1
in	1
Luscinda	1
alone	1
were	1
combined	1
all	1
the	1
charms	1
of	1
beauty	1
and	1
understanding	1
that	1
were	1
distributed	1
among	1
all	1
the	1
other	1
women	1
in	1
the	1
world.	1
It	1
is	1
true,	1
and	1
I	1
own	1
it	1
now,	1
that	1
though	1
I	1
knew	1
what	1
good	1
cause	1
Don	1
Fernando	1
had	1
to	1
praise	1
Luscinda,	1
it	1
gave	1
me	1
uneasiness	1
to	1
hear	1
these	1
praises	1
from	1
his	1
mouth,	1
and	1
I	1
began	1
to	1
fear,	1
and	1
with	1
reason	1
to	1
feel	1
distrust	1
of	1
him,	1
for	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
moment	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
ready	1
to	1
talk	1
of	1
Luscinda,	1
and	1
he	1
would	1
start	1
the	1
subject	1
himself	1
even	1
though	1
he	1
dragged	1
it	1
in	1
unseasonably,	1
a	1
circumstance	1
that	1
aroused	1
in	1
me	1
a	1
certain	1
amount	1
of	1
jealousy;	1
not	1
that	1
I	1
feared	1
any	1
change	1
in	1
the	1
constancy	1
or	1
faith	1
of	1
Luscinda;	1
but	1
still	1
my	1
fate	1
led	1
me	1
to	1
forebode	1
what	1
she	1
assured	1
me	1
against.	1
Don	1
Fernando	1
contrived	1
always	1
to	1
read	1
the	1
letters	1
I	1
sent	1
to	1
Luscinda	1
and	1
her	1
answers	1
to	1
me,	1
under	1
the	1
pretence	1
that	1
he	1
enjoyed	1
the	1
wit	1
and	1
sense	1
of	1
both.	1
It	1
so	1
happened,	1
then,	1
that	1
Luscinda	1
having	1
begged	1
of	1
me	1
a	1
book	1
of	1
chivalry	1
to	1
read,	1
one	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
very	1
fond	1
of,	1
Amadis	1
of	1
Gaul—”	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
no	1
sooner	1
heard	1
a	1
book	1
of	1
chivalry	1
mentioned,	1
than	1
he	1
said:	1
“Had	1
your	1
worship	1
told	1
me	1
at	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
your	1
story	1
that	1
the	1
Lady	1
Luscinda	1
was	1
fond	1
of	1
books	1
of	1
chivalry,	1
no	1
other	1
laudation	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
requisite	1
to	1
impress	1
upon	1
me	1
the	1
superiority	1
of	1
her	1
understanding,	1
for	1
it	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
been	1
of	1
the	1
excellence	1
you	1
describe	1
had	1
a	1
taste	1
for	1
such	1
delightful	1
reading	1
been	1
wanting;	1
so,	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
I	1
am	1
concerned,	1
you	1
need	1
waste	1
no	1
more	1
words	1
in	1
describing	1
her	1
beauty,	1
worth,	1
and	1
intelligence;	1
for,	1
on	1
merely	1
hearing	1
what	1
her	1
taste	1
was,	1
I	1
declare	1
her	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
most	1
beautiful	1
and	1
the	1
most	1
intelligent	1
woman	1
in	1
the	1
world;	1
and	1
I	1
wish	1
your	1
worship	1
had,	1
along	1
with	1
Amadis	1
of	1
Gaul,	1
sent	1
her	1
the	1
worthy	1
Don	1
Rugel	1
of	1
Greece,	1
for	1
I	1
know	1
the	1
Lady	1
Luscinda	1
would	1
greatly	1
relish	1
Daraida	1
and	1
Garaya,	1
and	1
the	1
shrewd	1
sayings	1
of	1
the	1
shepherd	1
Darinel,	1
and	1
the	1
admirable	1
verses	1
of	1
his	1
bucolics,	1
sung	1
and	1
delivered	1
by	1
him	1
with	1
such	1
sprightliness,	1
wit,	1
and	1
ease;	1
but	1
a	1
time	1
may	1
come	1
when	1
this	1
omission	1
can	1
be	1
remedied,	1
and	1
to	1
rectify	1
it	1
nothing	1
more	1
is	1
needed	1
than	1
for	1
your	1
worship	1
to	1
be	1
so	1
good	1
as	1
to	1
come	1
with	1
me	1
to	1
my	1
village,	1
for	1
there	1
I	1
can	1
give	1
you	1
more	1
than	1
three	1
hundred	1
books	1
which	1
are	1
the	1
delight	1
of	1
my	1
soul	1
and	1
the	1
entertainment	1
of	1
my	1
life;—though	1
it	1
occurs	1
to	1
me	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
got	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
now,	1
thanks	1
to	1
the	1
spite	1
of	1
wicked	1
and	1
envious	1
enchanters;—but	1
pardon	1
me	1
for	1
having	1
broken	1
the	1
promise	1
we	1
made	1
not	1
to	1
interrupt	1
your	1
discourse;	1
for	1
when	1
I	1
hear	1
chivalry	1
or	1
knights-errant	1
mentioned,	1
I	1
can	1
no	1
more	1
help	1
talking	1
about	1
them	1
than	1
the	1
rays	1
of	1
the	1
sun	1
can	1
help	1
giving	1
heat,	1
or	1
those	1
of	1
the	1
moon	1
moisture;	1
pardon	1
me,	1
therefore,	1
and	1
proceed,	1
for	1
that	1
is	1
more	1
to	1
the	1
purpose	1
now.”	1
While	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
was	1
saying	1
this,	1
Cardenio	1
allowed	1
his	1
head	1
to	1
fall	1
upon	1
his	1
breast,	1
and	1
seemed	1
plunged	1
in	1
deep	1
thought;	1
and	1
though	1
twice	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
bade	1
him	1
go	1
on	1
with	1
his	1
story,	1
he	1
neither	1
looked	1
up	1
nor	1
uttered	1
a	1
word	1
in	1
reply;	1
but	1
after	1
some	1
time	1
he	1
raised	1
his	1
head	1
and	1
said,	1
“I	1
cannot	1
get	1
rid	1
of	1
the	1
idea,	1
nor	1
will	1
anyone	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
remove	1
it,	1
or	1
make	1
me	1
think	1
otherwise—and	1
he	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
blockhead	1
who	1
would	1
hold	1
or	1
believe	1
anything	1
else	1
than	1
that	1
that	1
arrant	1
knave	1
Master	1
Elisabad	1
made	1
free	1
with	1
Queen	1
Madasima.”	1
“That	1
is	1
not	1
true,	1
by	1
all	1
that’s	1
good,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
in	1
high	1
wrath,	1
turning	1
upon	1
him	1
angrily,	1
as	1
his	1
way	1
was;	1
“and	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
very	1
great	1
slander,	1
or	1
rather	1
villainy.	1
Queen	1
Madasima	1
was	1
a	1
very	1
illustrious	1
lady,	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
supposed	1
that	1
so	1
exalted	1
a	1
princess	1
would	1
have	1
made	1
free	1
with	1
a	1
quack;	1
and	1
whoever	1
maintains	1
the	1
contrary	1
lies	1
like	1
a	1
great	1
scoundrel,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
him	1
to	1
know	1
it,	1
on	1
foot	1
or	1
on	1
horseback,	1
armed	1
or	1
unarmed,	1
by	1
night	1
or	1
by	1
day,	1
or	1
as	1
he	1
likes	1
best.”	1
Cardenio	1
was	1
looking	1
at	1
him	1
steadily,	1
and	1
his	1
mad	1
fit	1
having	1
now	1
come	1
upon	1
him,	1
he	1
had	1
no	1
disposition	1
to	1
go	1
on	1
with	1
his	1
story,	1
nor	1
would	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
have	1
listened	1
to	1
it,	1
so	1
much	1
had	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
heard	1
about	1
Madasima	1
disgusted	1
him.	1
Strange	1
to	1
say,	1
he	1
stood	1
up	1
for	1
her	1
as	1
if	1
she	1
were	1
in	1
earnest	1
his	1
veritable	1
born	1
lady;	1
to	1
such	1
a	1
pass	1
had	1
his	1
unholy	1
books	1
brought	1
him.	1
Cardenio,	1
then,	1
being,	1
as	1
I	1
said,	1
now	1
mad,	1
when	1
he	1
heard	1
himself	1
given	1
the	1
lie,	1
and	1
called	1
a	1
scoundrel	1
and	1
other	1
insulting	1
names,	1
not	1
relishing	1
the	1
jest,	1
snatched	1
up	1
a	1
stone	1
that	1
he	1
found	1
near	1
him,	1
and	1
with	1
it	1
delivered	1
such	1
a	1
blow	1
on	1
Don	1
Quixote’s	1
breast	1
that	1
he	1
laid	1
him	1
on	1
his	1
back.	1
Sancho	1
Panza,	1
seeing	1
his	1
master	1
treated	1
in	1
this	1
fashion,	1
attacked	1
the	1
madman	1
with	1
his	1
closed	1
fist;	1
but	1
the	1
Ragged	1
One	1
received	1
him	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
way	1
that	1
with	1
a	1
blow	1
of	1
his	1
fist	1
he	1
stretched	1
him	1
at	1
his	1
feet,	1
and	1
then	1
mounting	1
upon	1
him	1
crushed	1
his	1
ribs	1
to	1
his	1
own	1
satisfaction;	1
the	1
goatherd,	1
who	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
rescue,	1
shared	1
the	1
same	1
fate;	1
and	1
having	1
beaten	1
and	1
pummelled	1
them	1
all	1
he	1
left	1
them	1
and	1
quietly	1
withdrew	1
to	1
his	1
hiding-place	1
on	1
the	1
mountain.	1
Sancho	1
rose,	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
rage	1
he	1
felt	1
at	1
finding	1
himself	1
so	1
belaboured	1
without	1
deserving	1
it,	1
ran	1
to	1
take	1
vengeance	1
on	1
the	1
goatherd,	1
accusing	1
him	1
of	1
not	1
giving	1
them	1
warning	1
that	1
this	1
man	1
was	1
at	1
times	1
taken	1
with	1
a	1
mad	1
fit,	1
for	1
if	1
they	1
had	1
known	1
it	1
they	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
on	1
their	1
guard	1
to	1
protect	1
themselves.	1
The	1
goatherd	1
replied	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
said	1
so,	1
and	1
that	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
heard	1
him,	1
that	1
was	1
no	1
fault	1
of	1
his.	1
Sancho	1
retorted,	1
and	1
the	1
goatherd	1
rejoined,	1
and	1
the	1
altercation	1
ended	1
in	1
their	1
seizing	1
each	1
other	1
by	1
the	1
beard,	1
and	1
exchanging	1
such	1
fisticuffs	1
that	1
if	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
had	1
not	1
made	1
peace	1
between	1
them,	1
they	1
would	1
have	1
knocked	1
one	1
another	1
to	1
pieces.	1
“Leave	1
me	1
alone,	1
Sir	1
Knight	1
of	1
the	1
Rueful	1
Countenance,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
grappling	1
with	1
the	1
goatherd,	1
“for	1
of	1
this	1
fellow,	1
who	1
is	1
a	1
clown	1
like	1
myself,	1
and	1
no	1
dubbed	1
knight,	1
I	1
can	1
safely	1
take	1
satisfaction	1
for	1
the	1
affront	1
he	1
has	1
offered	1
me,	1
fighting	1
with	1
him	1
hand	1
to	1
hand	1
like	1
an	1
honest	1
man.”	1
“That	1
is	1
true,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“but	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
not	1
to	1
blame	1
for	1
what	1
has	1
happened.”	1
With	1
this	1
he	1
pacified	1
them,	1
and	1
again	1
asked	1
the	1
goatherd	1
if	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
possible	1
to	1
find	1
Cardenio,	1
as	1
he	1
felt	1
the	1
greatest	1
anxiety	1
to	1
know	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
his	1
story.	1
The	1
goatherd	1
told	1
him,	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
told	1
him	1
before,	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
knowing	1
of	1
a	1
certainty	1
where	1
his	1
lair	1
was;	1
but	1
that	1
if	1
he	1
wandered	1
about	1
much	1
in	1
that	1
neighbourhood	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
fail	1
to	1
fall	1
in	1
with	1
him	1
either	1
in	1
or	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
senses.	1

Don	1
Quixote	1
took	1
leave	1
of	1
the	1
goatherd,	1
and	1
once	1
more	1
mounting	1
Rocinante	1
bade	1
Sancho	1
follow	1
him,	1
which	1
he	1
having	1
no	1
ass,	1
did	1
very	1
discontentedly.	1
They	1
proceeded	1
slowly,	1
making	1
their	1
way	1
into	1
the	1
most	1
rugged	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
mountain,	1
Sancho	1
all	1
the	1
while	1
dying	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
talk	1
with	1
his	1
master,	1
and	1
longing	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
begin,	1
so	1
that	1
there	1
should	1
be	1
no	1
breach	1
of	1
the	1
injunction	1
laid	1
upon	1
him;	1
but	1
unable	1
to	1
keep	1
silence	1
so	1
long	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
him:	1
“Señor	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
give	1
me	1
your	1
worship’s	1
blessing	1
and	1
dismissal,	1
for	1
I’d	1
like	1
to	1
go	1
home	1
at	1
once	1
to	1
my	1
wife	1
and	1
children	1
with	1
whom	1
I	1
can	1
at	1
any	1
rate	1
talk	1
and	1
converse	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
I	1
like;	1
for	1
to	1
want	1
me	1
to	1
go	1
through	1
these	1
solitudes	1
day	1
and	1
night	1
and	1
not	1
speak	1
to	1
you	1
when	1
I	1
have	1
a	1
mind	1
is	1
burying	1
me	1
alive.	1
If	1
luck	1
would	1
have	1
it	1
that	1
animals	1
spoke	1
as	1
they	1
did	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
Guisopete,	1
it	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
so	1
bad,	1
because	1
I	1
could	1
talk	1
to	1
Rocinante	1
about	1
whatever	1
came	1
into	1
my	1
head,	1
and	1
so	1
put	1
up	1
with	1
my	1
ill-fortune;	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
hard	1
case,	1
and	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
borne	1
with	1
patience,	1
to	1
go	1
seeking	1
adventures	1
all	1
one’s	1
life	1
and	1
get	1
nothing	1
but	1
kicks	1
and	1
blanketings,	1
brickbats	1
and	1
punches,	1
and	1
with	1
all	1
this	1
to	1
have	1
to	1
sew	1
up	1
one’s	1
mouth	1
without	1
daring	1
to	1
say	1
what	1
is	1
in	1
one’s	1
heart,	1
just	1
as	1
if	1
one	1
were	1
dumb.”	1
“I	1
understand	1
thee,	1
Sancho,”	1
replied	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
“thou	1
art	1
dying	1
to	1
have	1
the	1
interdict	1
I	1
placed	1
upon	1
thy	1
tongue	1
removed;	1
consider	1
it	1
removed,	1
and	1
say	1
what	1
thou	1
wilt	1
while	1
we	1
are	1
wandering	1
in	1
these	1
mountains.”	1
“So	1
be	1
it,”	1
said	1
Sancho;	1
“let	1
me	1
speak	1
now,	1
for	1
God	1
knows	1
what	1
will	1
happen	1
by-and-by;	1
and	1
to	1
take	1
advantage	1
of	1
the	1
permit	1
at	1
once,	1
I	1
ask,	1
what	1
made	1
your	1
worship	1
stand	1
up	1
so	1
for	1
that	1
Queen	1
Majimasa,	1
or	1
whatever	1
her	1
name	1
is,	1
or	1
what	1
did	1
it	1
matter	1
whether	1
that	1
abbot	1
was	1
a	1
friend	1
of	1
hers	1
or	1
not?	1
for	1
if	1
your	1
worship	1
had	1
let	1
that	1
pass—and	1
you	1
were	1
not	1
a	1
judge	1
in	1
the	1
matter—it	1
is	1
my	1
belief	1
the	1
madman	1
would	1
have	1
gone	1
on	1
with	1
his	1
story,	1
and	1
the	1
blow	1
of	1
the	1
stone,	1
and	1
the	1
kicks,	1
and	1
more	1
than	1
half	1
a	1
dozen	1
cuffs	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
escaped.”	1
“In	1
faith,	1
Sancho,”	1
answered	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“if	1
thou	1
knewest	1
as	1
I	1
do	1
what	1
an	1
honourable	1
and	1
illustrious	1
lady	1
Queen	1
Madasima	1
was,	1
I	1
know	1
thou	1
wouldst	1
say	1
I	1
had	1
great	1
patience	1
that	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
break	1
in	1
pieces	1
the	1
mouth	1
that	1
uttered	1
such	1
blasphemies,	1
for	1
a	1
very	1
great	1
blasphemy	1
it	1
is	1
to	1
say	1
or	1
imagine	1
that	1
a	1
queen	1
has	1
made	1
free	1
with	1
a	1
surgeon.	1
The	1
truth	1
of	1
the	1
story	1
is	1
that	1
that	1
Master	1
Elisabad	1
whom	1
the	1
madman	1
mentioned	1
was	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
great	1
prudence	1
and	1
sound	1
judgment,	1
and	1
served	1
as	1
governor	1
and	1
physician	1
to	1
the	1
queen,	1
but	1
to	1
suppose	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
his	1
mistress	1
is	1
nonsense	1
deserving	1
very	1
severe	1
punishment;	1
and	1
as	1
a	1
proof	1
that	1
Cardenio	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
saying,	1
remember	1
when	1
he	1
said	1
it	1
he	1
was	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
wits.”	1
“That	1
is	1
what	1
I	1
say,”	1
said	1
Sancho;	1
“there	1
was	1
no	1
occasion	1
for	1
minding	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
a	1
madman;	1
for	1
if	1
good	1
luck	1
had	1
not	1
helped	1
your	1
worship,	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
sent	1
that	1
stone	1
at	1
your	1
head	1
instead	1
of	1
at	1
your	1
breast,	1
a	1
fine	1
way	1
we	1
should	1
have	1
been	1
in	1
for	1
standing	1
up	1
for	1
my	1
lady	1
yonder,	1
God	1
confound	1
her!	1
And	1
then,	1
would	1
not	1
Cardenio	1
have	1
gone	1
free	1
as	1
a	1
madman?”	1
“Against	1
men	1
in	1
their	1
senses	1
or	1
against	1
madmen,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“every	1
knight-errant	1
is	1
bound	1
to	1
stand	1
up	1
for	1
the	1
honour	1
of	1
women,	1
whoever	1
they	1
may	1
be,	1
much	1
more	1
for	1
queens	1
of	1
such	1
high	1
degree	1
and	1
dignity	1
as	1
Queen	1
Madasima,	1
for	1
whom	1
I	1
have	1
a	1
particular	1
regard	1
on	1
account	1
of	1
her	1
amiable	1
qualities;	1
for,	1
besides	1
being	1
extremely	1
beautiful,	1
she	1
was	1
very	1
wise,	1
and	1
very	1
patient	1
under	1
her	1
misfortunes,	1
of	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
many;	1
and	1
the	1
counsel	1
and	1
society	1
of	1
the	1
Master	1
Elisabad	1
were	1
a	1
great	1
help	1
and	1
support	1
to	1
her	1
in	1
enduring	1
her	1
afflictions	1
with	1
wisdom	1
and	1
resignation;	1
hence	1
the	1
ignorant	1
and	1
ill-disposed	1
vulgar	1
took	1
occasion	1
to	1
say	1
and	1
think	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
his	1
mistress;	1
and	1
they	1
lie,	1
I	1
say	1
it	1
once	1
more,	1
and	1
will	1
lie	1
two	1
hundred	1
times	1
more,	1
all	1
who	1
think	1
and	1
say	1
so.”	1
“I	1
neither	1
say	1
nor	1
think	1
so,”	1
said	1
Sancho;	1
“let	1
them	1
look	1
to	1
it;	1
with	1
their	1
bread	1
let	1
them	1
eat	1
it;	1
they	1
have	1
rendered	1
account	1
to	1
God	1
whether	1
they	1
misbehaved	1
or	1
not;	1
I	1
come	1
from	1
my	1
vineyard,	1
I	1
know	1
nothing;	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
fond	1
of	1
prying	1
into	1
other	1
men’s	1
lives;	1
he	1
who	1
buys	1
and	1
lies	1
feels	1
it	1
in	1
his	1
purse;	1
moreover,	1
naked	1
was	1
I	1
born,	1
naked	1
I	1
find	1
myself,	1
I	1
neither	1
lose	1
nor	1
gain;	1
but	1
if	1
they	1
did,	1
what	1
is	1
that	1
to	1
me?	1
many	1
think	1
there	1
are	1
flitches	1
where	1
there	1
are	1
no	1
hooks;	1
but	1
who	1
can	1
put	1
gates	1
to	1
the	1
open	1
plain?	1
moreover	1
they	1
said	1
of	1
God—”	1
“God	1
bless	1
me,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“what	1
a	1
set	1
of	1
absurdities	1
thou	1
art	1
stringing	1
together!	1
What	1
has	1
what	1
we	1
are	1
talking	1
about	1
got	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
the	1
proverbs	1
thou	1
art	1
threading	1
one	1
after	1
the	1
other?	1
for	1
God’s	1
sake	1
hold	1
thy	1
tongue,	1
Sancho,	1
and	1
henceforward	1
keep	1
to	1
prodding	1
thy	1
ass	1
and	1
don’t	1
meddle	1
in	1
what	1
does	1
not	1
concern	1
thee;	1
and	1
understand	1
with	1
all	1
thy	1
five	1
senses	1
that	1
everything	1
I	1
have	1
done,	1
am	1
doing,	1
or	1
shall	1
do,	1
is	1
well	1
founded	1
on	1
reason	1
and	1
in	1
conformity	1
with	1
the	1
rules	1
of	1
chivalry,	1
for	1
I	1
understand	1
them	1
better	1
than	1
all	1
the	1
world	1
that	1
profess	1
them.”	1
“Señor,”	1
replied	1
Sancho,	1
“is	1
it	1
a	1
good	1
rule	1
of	1
chivalry	1
that	1
we	1
should	1
go	1

“Peace,	1
I	1
say	1
again,	1
Sancho,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“for	1
let	1
me	1
tell	1
thee	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
so	1
much	1
the	1
desire	1
of	1
finding	1
that	1
madman	1
that	1
leads	1
me	1
into	1
these	1
regions	1
as	1
that	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
of	1
performing	1
among	1
them	1
an	1
achievement	1
wherewith	1
I	1
shall	1
win	1
eternal	1
name	1
and	1
fame	1
throughout	1
the	1
known	1
world;	1
and	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
such	1
that	1
I	1
shall	1
thereby	1
set	1
the	1
seal	1
on	1
all	1
that	1
can	1
make	1
a	1
knight-errant	1
perfect	1
and	1
famous.”	1
“And	1
is	1
it	1
very	1
perilous,	1
this	1
achievement?”	1
“No,”	1
replied	1
he	1
of	1
the	1
Rueful	1
Countenance;	1
“though	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
dice	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
throw	1
deuce-ace	1
instead	1
of	1
sixes;	1
but	1
all	1
will	1
depend	1
on	1
thy	1
diligence.”	1
“On	1
my	1
diligence!”	1
said	1
Sancho.	1
“Yes,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“for	1
if	1
thou	1
dost	1
return	1
soon	1
from	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
I	1
mean	1
to	1
send	1
thee,	1
my	1
penance	1
will	1
be	1
soon	1
over,	1
and	1
my	1
glory	1
will	1
soon	1
begin.	1
But	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
right	1
to	1
keep	1
thee	1
any	1
longer	1
in	1
suspense,	1
waiting	1
to	1
see	1
what	1
comes	1
of	1
my	1
words,	1
I	1
would	1
have	1
thee	1
know,	1
Sancho,	1
that	1
the	1
famous	1
Amadis	1
of	1
Gaul	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
perfect	1
knights-errant—I	1
am	1
wrong	1
to	1
say	1
he	1
was	1
one;	1
he	1
stood	1
alone,	1
the	1
first,	1
the	1
only	1
one,	1
the	1
lord	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
in	1
his	1
time.	1
A	1
fig	1
for	1
Don	1
Belianis,	1
and	1
for	1
all	1
who	1
say	1
he	1
equalled	1
him	1
in	1
any	1
respect,	1
for,	1
my	1
oath	1
upon	1
it,	1
they	1
are	1
deceiving	1
themselves!	1
I	1
say,	1
too,	1
that	1
when	1
a	1
painter	1
desires	1
to	1
become	1
famous	1
in	1
his	1
art	1
he	1
endeavours	1
to	1
copy	1
the	1
originals	1
of	1
the	1
rarest	1
painters	1
that	1
he	1
knows;	1
and	1
the	1
same	1
rule	1
holds	1
good	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
most	1
important	1
crafts	1
and	1
callings	1
that	1
serve	1
to	1
adorn	1
a	1
state;	1
thus	1
must	1
he	1
who	1
would	1
be	1
esteemed	1
prudent	1
and	1
patient	1
imitate	1
Ulysses,	1
in	1
whose	1
person	1
and	1
labours	1
Homer	1
presents	1
to	1
us	1
a	1
lively	1
picture	1
of	1
prudence	1
and	1
patience;	1
as	1
Virgil,	1
too,	1
shows	1
us	1
in	1
the	1
person	1
of	1
Æneas	1
the	1
virtue	1
of	1
a	1
pious	1
son	1
and	1
the	1
sagacity	1
of	1
a	1
brave	1
and	1
skilful	1
captain;	1
not	1
representing	1
or	1
describing	1
them	1
as	1
they	1
were,	1
but	1
as	1
they	1
ought	1
to	1
be,	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
leave	1
the	1
example	1
of	1
their	1
virtues	1
to	1
posterity.	1
In	1
the	1
same	1
way	1
Amadis	1
was	1
the	1
polestar,	1
day-star,	1
sun	1
of	1
valiant	1
and	1
devoted	1
knights,	1
whom	1
all	1
we	1
who	1
fight	1
under	1
the	1
banner	1
of	1
love	1
and	1
chivalry	1
are	1
bound	1
to	1
imitate.	1
This,	1
then,	1
being	1
so,	1
I	1
consider,	1
friend	1
Sancho,	1
that	1
the	1
knight-errant	1
who	1
shall	1
imitate	1
him	1
most	1
closely	1
will	1
come	1
nearest	1
to	1
reaching	1
the	1
perfection	1
of	1
chivalry.	1
Now	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
instances	1
in	1
which	1
this	1
knight	1
most	1
conspicuously	1
showed	1
his	1
prudence,	1
worth,	1
valour,	1
endurance,	1
fortitude,	1
and	1
love,	1
was	1
when	1
he	1
withdrew,	1
rejected	1
by	1
the	1
Lady	1
Oriana,	1
to	1
do	1
penance	1
upon	1
the	1
Peña	1
Pobre,	1
changing	1
his	1
name	1
into	1
that	1
of	1
Beltenebros,	1
a	1
name	1
assuredly	1
significant	1
and	1
appropriate	1
to	1
the	1
life	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
voluntarily	1
adopted.	1
So,	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
easier	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
imitate	1
him	1
in	1
this	1
than	1
in	1
cleaving	1
giants	1
asunder,	1
cutting	1
off	1
serpents’	1
heads,	1
slaying	1
dragons,	1
routing	1
armies,	1
destroying	1
fleets,	1
and	1
breaking	1
enchantments,	1
and	1
as	1
this	1
place	1
is	1
so	1
well	1
suited	1
for	1
a	1
similar	1
purpose,	1
I	1
must	1
not	1
allow	1
the	1
opportunity	1
to	1
escape	1
which	1
now	1
so	1
conveniently	1
offers	1
me	1
its	1
forelock.”	1
“What	1
is	1
it	1
in	1
reality,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“that	1
your	1
worship	1
means	1
to	1
do	1
in	1
such	1
an	1
out-of-the-way	1
place	1
as	1
this?”	1
“Have	1
I	1
not	1
told	1
thee,”	1
answered	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“that	1
I	1
mean	1
to	1
imitate	1
Amadis	1
here,	1
playing	1
the	1
victim	1
of	1
despair,	1
the	1
madman,	1
the	1
maniac,	1
so	1
as	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
to	1
imitate	1
the	1
valiant	1
Don	1
Roland,	1
when	1
at	1
the	1
fountain	1
he	1
had	1
evidence	1
of	1
the	1
fair	1
Angelica	1
having	1
disgraced	1
herself	1
with	1
Medoro	1
and	1
through	1
grief	1
thereat	1
went	1
mad,	1
and	1
plucked	1
up	1
trees,	1
troubled	1
the	1
waters	1
of	1
the	1
clear	1
springs,	1
slew	1
destroyed	1
flocks,	1
burned	1
down	1
huts,	1
levelled	1
houses,	1
dragged	1
mares	1
after	1
him,	1
and	1
perpetrated	1
a	1
hundred	1
thousand	1
other	1
outrages	1
worthy	1
of	1
everlasting	1
renown	1
and	1
record?	1
And	1
though	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
intention	1
of	1
imitating	1
Roland,	1
or	1
Orlando,	1
or	1
Rotolando	1
(for	1
he	1
went	1
by	1
all	1
these	1
names),	1
step	1
by	1
step	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
mad	1
things	1
he	1
did,	1
said,	1
and	1
thought,	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
a	1
rough	1
copy	1
to	1
the	1
best	1
of	1
my	1
power	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
seems	1
to	1
me	1
most	1
essential;	1
but	1
perhaps	1
I	1
shall	1
content	1
myself	1
with	1
the	1
simple	1
imitation	1
of	1
Amadis,	1
who	1
without	1
giving	1
way	1
to	1
any	1
mischievous	1
madness	1
but	1
merely	1
to	1
tears	1
and	1
sorrow,	1
gained	1
as	1
much	1
fame	1
as	1
the	1
most	1
famous.”	1
“It	1
seems	1
to	1
me,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“that	1
the	1
knights	1
who	1
behaved	1
in	1
this	1
way	1
had	1
provocation	1
and	1
cause	1
for	1
those	1
follies	1
and	1
penances;	1
but	1
what	1
cause	1
has	1
your	1
worship	1
for	1
going	1
mad?	1
What	1
lady	1
has	1
rejected	1
you,	1
or	1
what	1
evidence	1
have	1
you	1
found	1
to	1
prove	1
that	1
the	1
lady	1
Dulcinea	1
del	1
Toboso	1
has	1
been	1
trifling	1
with	1
Moor	1
or	1
Christian?”	1
“There	1
is	1
the	1
point,”	1
replied	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“and	1
that	1
is	1
the	1
beauty	1
of	1
this	1
business	1
of	1
mine;	1
no	1
thanks	1
to	1
a	1
knight-errant	1
for	1
going	1
mad	1
when	1
he	1
has	1
cause;	1
the	1
thing	1
is	1
to	1
turn	1
crazy	1
without	1
any	1
provocation,	1
and	1
let	1
my	1
lady	1
know,	1
if	1
I	1
do	1
this	1
in	1
the	1
dry,	1
what	1
I	1
would	1
do	1
in	1
the	1
moist;	1
moreover	1
I	1
have	1
abundant	1
cause	1
in	1
the	1
long	1
separation	1
I	1
have	1
endured	1
from	1
my	1
lady	1
till	1
death,	1
Dulcinea	1
del	1
Toboso;	1
for	1
as	1
thou	1
didst	1
hear	1
that	1
shepherd	1
Ambrosio	1
say	1
the	1
other	1
day,	1
in	1
absence	1
all	1
ills	1
are	1
felt	1
and	1
feared;	1
and	1
so,	1
friend	1
Sancho,	1
waste	1
no	1
time	1
in	1
advising	1
me	1
against	1
so	1
rare,	1
so	1
happy,	1
and	1
so	1
unheard-of	1
an	1
imitation;	1
mad	1
I	1
am,	1
and	1
mad	1
I	1
must	1
be	1
until	1
thou	1
returnest	1
with	1
the	1
answer	1
to	1
a	1
letter	1
that	1
I	1
mean	1
to	1
send	1
by	1
thee	1
to	1
my	1
lady	1
Dulcinea;	1
and	1
if	1
it	1
be	1
such	1
as	1
my	1
constancy	1
deserves,	1
my	1
insanity	1
and	1
penance	1
will	1
come	1
to	1
an	1
end;	1
and	1
if	1
it	1
be	1
to	1
the	1
opposite	1
effect,	1
I	1
shall	1
become	1
mad	1
in	1
earnest,	1
and,	1
being	1
so,	1
I	1
shall	1
suffer	1
no	1
more;	1
thus	1
in	1
whatever	1
way	1
she	1
may	1
answer	1
I	1
shall	1
escape	1
from	1
the	1
struggle	1
and	1
affliction	1
in	1
which	1
thou	1
wilt	1
leave	1
me,	1
enjoying	1
in	1
my	1
senses	1
the	1
boon	1
thou	1
bearest	1
me,	1
or	1
as	1
a	1
madman	1
not	1
feeling	1
the	1
evil	1
thou	1
bringest	1
me.	1
But	1
tell	1
me,	1
Sancho,	1
hast	1
thou	1
got	1
Mambrino’s	1
helmet	1
safe?	1
for	1
I	1
saw	1
thee	1
take	1
it	1
up	1
from	1
the	1
ground	1
when	1
that	1
ungrateful	1
wretch	1
tried	1
to	1
break	1
it	1
in	1
pieces	1
but	1
could	1
not,	1
by	1
which	1
the	1
fineness	1
of	1
its	1
temper	1
may	1
be	1
seen.”	1
To	1
which	1
Sancho	1
made	1
answer,	1
“By	1
the	1
living	1
God,	1
Sir	1
Knight	1
of	1
the	1
Rueful	1
Countenance,	1
I	1
cannot	1
endure	1
or	1
bear	1
with	1
patience	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
things	1
that	1
your	1
worship	1
says;	1
and	1
from	1
them	1
I	1
begin	1
to	1
suspect	1
that	1
all	1
you	1
tell	1
me	1
about	1
chivalry,	1
and	1
winning	1
kingdoms	1
and	1
empires,	1
and	1
giving	1
islands,	1
and	1
bestowing	1
other	1
rewards	1
and	1
dignities	1
after	1
the	1
custom	1
of	1
knights-errant,	1
must	1
be	1
all	1
made	1
up	1
of	1
wind	1
and	1
lies,	1
and	1
all	1
pigments	1
or	1
figments,	1
or	1
whatever	1
we	1
may	1
call	1
them;	1
for	1
what	1
would	1
anyone	1
think	1
that	1
heard	1
your	1
worship	1
calling	1
a	1
barber’s	1
basin	1
Mambrino’s	1
helmet	1
without	1
ever	1
seeing	1
the	1
mistake	1
all	1
this	1
time,	1
but	1
that	1
one	1
who	1
says	1
and	1
maintains	1
such	1
things	1
must	1
have	1
his	1
brains	1
addled?	1
I	1
have	1
the	1
basin	1
in	1
my	1
sack	1
all	1
dinted,	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
taking	1
it	1
home	1
to	1
have	1
it	1
mended,	1
to	1
trim	1
my	1
beard	1
in	1
it,	1
if,	1
by	1
God’s	1
grace,	1
I	1
am	1
allowed	1
to	1
see	1
my	1
wife	1
and	1
children	1
some	1
day	1
or	1
other.”	1
“Look	1
here,	1
Sancho,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“by	1
him	1
thou	1
didst	1
swear	1
by	1
just	1
now	1
I	1
swear	1
thou	1
hast	1
the	1
most	1
limited	1
understanding	1
that	1
any	1
squire	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
has	1
or	1
ever	1
had.	1
Is	1
it	1
possible	1
that	1
all	1
this	1
time	1
thou	1
hast	1
been	1
going	1
about	1
with	1
me	1
thou	1
hast	1
never	1
found	1
out	1
that	1
all	1
things	1
belonging	1
to	1
knights-errant	1
seem	1
to	1
be	1
illusions	1
and	1
nonsense	1
and	1
ravings,	1
and	1
to	1
go	1
always	1
by	1
contraries?	1
And	1
not	1
because	1
it	1
really	1
is	1
so,	1
but	1
because	1
there	1
is	1
always	1
a	1
swarm	1
of	1
enchanters	1
in	1
attendance	1
upon	1
us	1
that	1
change	1
and	1
alter	1
everything	1
with	1
us,	1
and	1
turn	1
things	1
as	1
they	1
please,	1
and	1
according	1
as	1
they	1
are	1
disposed	1
to	1
aid	1
or	1
destroy	1
us;	1
thus	1
what	1
seems	1
to	1
thee	1
a	1
barber’s	1
basin	1
seems	1
to	1
me	1
Mambrino’s	1
helmet,	1
and	1
to	1
another	1
it	1
will	1
seem	1
something	1
else;	1
and	1
rare	1
foresight	1
it	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
sage	1
who	1
is	1
on	1
my	1
side	1
to	1
make	1
what	1
is	1
really	1
and	1
truly	1
Mambrino’s	1
helmet	1
seem	1
a	1
basin	1
to	1
everybody,	1
for,	1
being	1
held	1
in	1
such	1
estimation	1
as	1
it	1
is,	1
all	1
the	1
world	1
would	1
pursue	1
me	1
to	1
rob	1
me	1
of	1
it;	1
but	1
when	1
they	1
see	1
it	1
is	1
only	1
a	1
barber’s	1
basin	1
they	1
do	1
not	1
take	1
the	1
trouble	1
to	1
obtain	1
it;	1
as	1
was	1
plainly	1
shown	1
by	1
him	1
who	1
tried	1
to	1
break	1
it,	1
and	1
left	1
it	1
on	1
the	1
ground	1
without	1
taking	1
it,	1
for,	1
by	1
my	1
faith,	1
had	1
he	1
known	1
it	1
he	1
would	1
never	1
have	1
left	1
it	1
behind.	1
Keep	1
it	1
safe,	1
my	1
friend,	1
for	1
just	1
now	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
need	1
of	1
it;	1
indeed,	1
I	1
shall	1
have	1
to	1
take	1
off	1
all	1
this	1
armour	1
and	1
remain	1
as	1
naked	1
as	1
I	1
was	1
born,	1
if	1
I	1
have	1
a	1
mind	1
to	1
follow	1
Roland	1
rather	1
than	1
Amadis	1
in	1
my	1
penance.”	1
Thus	1
talking	1
they	1
reached	1
the	1
foot	1
of	1
a	1
high	1
mountain	1
which	1
stood	1
like	1
an	1
isolated	1
peak	1
among	1
the	1
others	1
that	1
surrounded	1
it.	1
Past	1
its	1
base	1
there	1
flowed	1
a	1
gentle	1
brook,	1
all	1
around	1
it	1
spread	1
a	1
meadow	1
so	1
green	1
and	1
luxuriant	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
delight	1
to	1
the	1
eyes	1
to	1
look	1
upon	1
it,	1
and	1
forest	1
trees	1
in	1
abundance,	1
and	1
shrubs	1
and	1
flowers,	1
added	1
to	1
the	1
charms	1
of	1
the	1
spot.	1
Upon	1
this	1
place	1
the	1
Knight	1
of	1
the	1
Rueful	1
Countenance	1
fixed	1
his	1
choice	1
for	1
the	1
performance	1
of	1
his	1
penance,	1
and	1
as	1
he	1
beheld	1
it	1
exclaimed	1
in	1
a	1
loud	1
voice	1
as	1
though	1
he	1
were	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
senses:	1
“This	1
is	1
the	1
place,	1
oh,	1
ye	1
heavens,	1
that	1
I	1
select	1
and	1
choose	1
for	1
bewailing	1
the	1
misfortune	1
in	1
which	1
ye	1
yourselves	1
have	1
plunged	1
me:	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
spot	1
where	1
the	1
overflowings	1
of	1
mine	1
eyes	1
shall	1
swell	1
the	1
waters	1
of	1
yon	1
little	1
brook,	1
and	1
my	1
deep	1
and	1
endless	1
sighs	1
shall	1
stir	1
unceasingly	1
the	1
leaves	1
of	1
these	1
mountain	1
trees,	1
in	1
testimony	1
and	1
token	1
of	1
the	1
pain	1
my	1
persecuted	1
heart	1
is	1
suffering.	1
Oh,	1
ye	1
rural	1
deities,	1
whoever	1
ye	1
be	1
that	1
haunt	1
this	1
lone	1
spot,	1
give	1
ear	1
to	1
the	1
complaint	1
of	1
a	1
wretched	1
lover	1
whom	1
long	1
absence	1
and	1
brooding	1
jealousy	1
have	1
driven	1
to	1
bewail	1
his	1
fate	1
among	1
these	1
wilds	1
and	1
complain	1
of	1
the	1
hard	1
heart	1
of	1
that	1
fair	1
and	1
ungrateful	1
one,	1
the	1
end	1
and	1
limit	1
of	1
all	1
human	1
beauty!	1
Oh,	1
ye	1
wood	1
nymphs	1
and	1
dryads,	1
that	1
dwell	1
in	1
the	1
thickets	1
of	1
the	1
forest,	1
so	1
may	1
the	1
nimble	1
wanton	1
satyrs	1
by	1
whom	1
ye	1
are	1
vainly	1
wooed	1
never	1
disturb	1
your	1
sweet	1
repose,	1
help	1
me	1
to	1
lament	1
my	1
hard	1
fate	1
or	1
at	1
least	1
weary	1
not	1
at	1
listening	1
to	1
it!	1
Oh,	1
Dulcinea	1
del	1
Toboso,	1
day	1
of	1
my	1
night,	1
glory	1
of	1
my	1
pain,	1
guide	1
of	1
my	1
path,	1
star	1
of	1
my	1
fortune,	1
so	1
may	1
Heaven	1
grant	1
thee	1
in	1
full	1
all	1
thou	1
seekest	1
of	1
it,	1
bethink	1
thee	1
of	1
the	1
place	1
and	1
condition	1
to	1
which	1
absence	1
from	1
thee	1
has	1
brought	1
me,	1
and	1
make	1
that	1
return	1
in	1
kindness	1
that	1
is	1
due	1
to	1
my	1
fidelity!	1
Oh,	1
lonely	1
trees,	1
that	1
from	1
this	1
day	1
forward	1
shall	1
bear	1
me	1
company	1
in	1
my	1
solitude,	1
give	1
me	1
some	1
sign	1
by	1
the	1
gentle	1
movement	1
of	1
your	1
boughs	1
that	1
my	1
presence	1
is	1
not	1
distasteful	1
to	1
you!	1
Oh,	1
thou,	1
my	1
squire,	1
pleasant	1
companion	1
in	1
my	1
prosperous	1
and	1
adverse	1
fortunes,	1
fix	1
well	1
in	1
thy	1
memory	1
what	1
thou	1
shalt	1
see	1
me	1
do	1
here,	1
so	1
that	1
thou	1
mayest	1
relate	1
and	1
report	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
sole	1
cause	1
of	1
all,”	1
and	1
so	1
saying	1
he	1
dismounted	1
from	1
Rocinante,	1
and	1
in	1
an	1
instant	1
relieved	1
him	1
of	1
saddle	1
and	1
bridle,	1
and	1
giving	1
him	1
a	1
slap	1
on	1
the	1
croup,	1
said,	1
“He	1
gives	1
thee	1
freedom	1
who	1
is	1
bereft	1
of	1
it	1
himself,	1
oh	1
steed	1
as	1
excellent	1
in	1
deed	1
as	1
thou	1
art	1
unfortunate	1
in	1
thy	1
lot;	1
begone	1
where	1
thou	1
wilt,	1
for	1
thou	1
bearest	1
written	1
on	1
thy	1
forehead	1
that	1
neither	1
Astolfo’s	1
hippogriff,	1
nor	1
the	1
famed	1
Frontino	1
that	1
cost	1
Bradamante	1
so	1
dear,	1
could	1
equal	1
thee	1
in	1
speed.”	1
Seeing	1
this	1
Sancho	1
said,	1
“Good	1
luck	1
to	1
him	1
who	1
has	1
saved	1
us	1
the	1
trouble	1
of	1
stripping	1
the	1
pack-saddle	1
off	1
Dapple!	1
By	1
my	1
faith	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
gone	1
without	1
a	1
slap	1
on	1
the	1
croup	1
and	1
something	1
said	1
in	1
his	1
praise;	1
though	1
if	1
he	1
were	1
here	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
let	1
anyone	1
strip	1
him,	1
for	1
there	1
would	1
be	1
no	1
occasion,	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
nothing	1
of	1
the	1
lover	1
or	1
victim	1
of	1
despair	1
about	1
him,	1
inasmuch	1
as	1
his	1
master,	1
which	1
I	1
was	1
while	1
it	1
was	1
God’s	1
pleasure,	1
was	1
nothing	1
of	1
the	1
sort;	1
and	1
indeed,	1
Sir	1
Knight	1
of	1
the	1
Rueful	1
Countenance,	1
if	1
my	1
departure	1
and	1
your	1
worship’s	1
madness	1
are	1
to	1
come	1
off	1
in	1
earnest,	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
as	1
well	1
to	1
saddle	1
Rocinante	1
again	1
in	1
order	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
supply	1
the	1
want	1
of	1
Dapple,	1
because	1
it	1
will	1
save	1
me	1
time	1
in	1
going	1
and	1
returning:	1
for	1
if	1
I	1
go	1
on	1
foot	1
I	1
don’t	1
know	1
when	1
I	1
shall	1
get	1
there	1
or	1
when	1
I	1
shall	1
get	1
back,	1
as	1
I	1
am,	1
in	1
truth,	1
a	1
bad	1
walker.”	1
“I	1
declare,	1
Sancho,”	1
returned	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“it	1
shall	1
be	1
as	1
thou	1
wilt,	1
for	1
thy	1
plan	1
does	1
not	1
seem	1
to	1
me	1
a	1
bad	1
one,	1
and	1
three	1
days	1
hence	1
thou	1
wilt	1
depart,	1
for	1
I	1
wish	1
thee	1
to	1
observe	1
in	1
the	1
meantime	1
what	1
I	1
do	1
and	1
say	1
for	1
her	1
sake,	1
that	1
thou	1
mayest	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
tell	1
it.”	1
“But	1
what	1
more	1
have	1
I	1
to	1
see	1
besides	1
what	1
I	1
have	1
seen?”	1
said	1
Sancho.	1
“Much	1
thou	1
knowest	1
about	1
it!”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote.	1
“I	1
have	1
now	1
got	1
to	1
tear	1
up	1
my	1
garments,	1
to	1
scatter	1
about	1
my	1
armour,	1
knock	1
my	1
head	1
against	1
these	1
rocks,	1
and	1
more	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
sort	1
of	1
thing,	1
which	1
thou	1
must	1
witness.”	1
“For	1
the	1
love	1
of	1
God,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“be	1
careful,	1
your	1
worship,	1
how	1
you	1
give	1
yourself	1
those	1
knocks	1
on	1
the	1
head,	1
for	1
you	1
may	1
come	1
across	1
such	1
a	1
rock,	1
and	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
way,	1
that	1
the	1
very	1
first	1
may	1
put	1
an	1
end	1
to	1
the	1
whole	1
contrivance	1
of	1
this	1
penance;	1
and	1
I	1
should	1
think,	1
if	1
indeed	1
knocks	1
on	1
the	1
head	1
seem	1
necessary	1
to	1
you,	1
and	1
this	1
business	1
cannot	1
be	1
done	1
without	1
them,	1
you	1
might	1
be	1
content—as	1
the	1
whole	1
thing	1
is	1
feigned,	1
and	1
counterfeit,	1
and	1
in	1
joke—you	1
might	1
be	1
content,	1
I	1
say,	1
with	1
giving	1
them	1
to	1
yourself	1
in	1
the	1
water,	1
or	1
against	1
something	1
soft,	1
like	1
cotton;	1
and	1
leave	1
it	1
all	1
to	1
me;	1
for	1
I’ll	1
tell	1
my	1
lady	1
that	1
your	1
worship	1
knocked	1
your	1
head	1
against	1
a	1
point	1
of	1
rock	1
harder	1
than	1
a	1
diamond.”	1
“I	1
thank	1
thee	1
for	1
thy	1
good	1
intentions,	1
friend	1
Sancho,”	1
answered	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“but	1
I	1
would	1
have	1
thee	1
know	1
that	1
all	1
these	1
things	1
I	1
am	1
doing	1
are	1
not	1
in	1
joke,	1
but	1
very	1
much	1
in	1
earnest,	1
for	1
anything	1
else	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
transgression	1
of	1
the	1
ordinances	1
of	1
chivalry,	1
which	1
forbid	1
us	1
to	1
tell	1
any	1
lie	1
whatever	1
under	1
the	1
penalties	1
due	1
to	1
apostasy;	1
and	1
to	1
do	1
one	1
thing	1
instead	1
of	1
another	1
is	1
just	1
the	1
same	1
as	1
lying;	1
so	1
my	1
knocks	1
on	1
the	1
head	1
must	1
be	1
real,	1
solid,	1
and	1
valid,	1
without	1
anything	1
sophisticated	1
or	1
fanciful	1
about	1
them,	1
and	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
needful	1
to	1
leave	1
me	1
some	1
lint	1
to	1
dress	1
my	1
wounds,	1
since	1
fortune	1
has	1
compelled	1
us	1
to	1
do	1
without	1
the	1
balsam	1
we	1
lost.”	1
“It	1
was	1
worse	1
losing	1
the	1
ass,”	1
replied	1
Sancho,	1
“for	1
with	1
him	1
lint	1
and	1
all	1
were	1
lost;	1
but	1
I	1
beg	1
of	1
your	1
worship	1
not	1
to	1
remind	1
me	1
again	1
of	1
that	1
accursed	1
liquor,	1
for	1
my	1
soul,	1
not	1
to	1
say	1
my	1
stomach,	1
turns	1
at	1
hearing	1
the	1
very	1
name	1
of	1
it;	1
and	1
I	1
beg	1
of	1
you,	1
too,	1
to	1
reckon	1
as	1
past	1
the	1
three	1
days	1
you	1
allowed	1
me	1
for	1
seeing	1
the	1
mad	1
things	1
you	1
do,	1
for	1
I	1
take	1
them	1
as	1
seen	1
already	1
and	1
pronounced	1
upon,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
tell	1
wonderful	1
stories	1
to	1
my	1
lady;	1
so	1
write	1
the	1
letter	1
and	1
send	1
me	1
off	1
at	1
once,	1
for	1
I	1
long	1
to	1
return	1
and	1
take	1
your	1
worship	1
out	1
of	1
this	1
purgatory	1
where	1
I	1
am	1
leaving	1
you.”	1
“Purgatory	1
dost	1
thou	1
call	1
it,	1
Sancho?”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“rather	1
call	1
it	1
hell,	1
or	1
even	1
worse	1
if	1
there	1
be	1
anything	1
worse.”	1
“For	1
one	1
who	1
is	1
in	1
hell,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“_nulla	1
est	1
retentio_,	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
heard	1
say.”	1
“I	1
do	1
not	1
understand	1
what	1
_retentio_	1
means,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote.	1
“_Retentio_,”	1
answered	1
Sancho,	1
“means	1
that	1
whoever	1
is	1
in	1
hell	1
never	1
comes	1
nor	1
can	1
come	1
out	1
of	1
it,	1
which	1
will	1
be	1
the	1
opposite	1
case	1
with	1
your	1
worship	1
or	1
my	1
legs	1
will	1
be	1
idle,	1
that	1
is	1
if	1
I	1
have	1
spurs	1
to	1
enliven	1
Rocinante:	1
let	1
me	1
once	1
get	1
to	1
El	1
Toboso	1
and	1
into	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
my	1
lady	1
Dulcinea,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
tell	1
her	1
such	1
things	1
of	1
the	1
follies	1
and	1
madnesses	1
(for	1
it	1
is	1
all	1
one)	1
that	1
your	1
worship	1
has	1
done	1
and	1
is	1
still	1
doing,	1
that	1
I	1
will	1
manage	1
to	1
make	1
her	1
softer	1
than	1
a	1
glove	1
though	1
I	1
find	1
her	1
harder	1
than	1
a	1
cork	1
tree;	1
and	1
with	1
her	1
sweet	1
and	1
honeyed	1
answer	1
I	1
will	1
come	1
back	1
through	1
the	1
air	1
like	1
a	1
witch,	1
and	1
take	1
your	1
worship	1
out	1
of	1
this	1
purgatory	1
that	1
seems	1
to	1
be	1
hell	1
but	1
is	1
not,	1
as	1
there	1
is	1
hope	1
of	1
getting	1
out	1
of	1
it;	1
which,	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
said,	1
those	1
in	1
hell	1
have	1
not,	1
and	1
I	1
believe	1
your	1
worship	1
will	1
not	1
say	1
anything	1
to	1
the	1
contrary.”	1
“That	1
is	1
true,”	1
said	1
he	1
of	1
the	1
Rueful	1
Countenance,	1
“but	1
how	1
shall	1
we	1
manage	1
to	1
write	1
the	1
letter?”	1
“And	1
the	1
ass-colt	1
order	1
too,”	1
added	1
Sancho.	1
“All	1
shall	1
be	1
included,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
“and	1
as	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
paper,	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
well	1
done	1
to	1
write	1
it	1
on	1
the	1
leaves	1
of	1
trees,	1
as	1
the	1
ancients	1
did,	1
or	1
on	1
tablets	1
of	1
wax;	1
though	1
that	1
would	1
be	1
as	1
hard	1
to	1
find	1
just	1
now	1
as	1
paper.	1
But	1
it	1
has	1
just	1
occurred	1
to	1
me	1
how	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
conveniently	1
and	1
even	1
more	1
than	1
conveniently	1
written,	1
and	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
notebook	1
that	1
belonged	1
to	1
Cardenio,	1
and	1
thou	1
wilt	1
take	1
care	1
to	1
have	1
it	1
copied	1
on	1
paper,	1
in	1
a	1
good	1
hand,	1
at	1
the	1
first	1
village	1
thou	1
comest	1
to	1
where	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
schoolmaster,	1
or	1
if	1
not,	1
any	1
sacristan	1
will	1
copy	1
it;	1
but	1
see	1
thou	1
give	1
it	1
not	1
to	1
any	1
notary	1
to	1
copy,	1
for	1
they	1
write	1
a	1
law	1
hand	1
that	1
Satan	1
could	1
not	1
make	1
out.”	1
“But	1
what	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
done	1
about	1
the	1
signature?”	1
said	1
Sancho.	1
“The	1
letters	1
of	1
Amadis	1
were	1
never	1
signed,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote.	1
“That	1
is	1
all	1
very	1
well,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“but	1
the	1
order	1
must	1
needs	1
be	1
signed,	1
and	1
if	1
it	1
is	1
copied	1
they	1
will	1
say	1
the	1
signature	1
is	1
false,	1
and	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
left	1
without	1
ass-colts.”	1
“The	1
order	1
shall	1
go	1
signed	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
book,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“and	1
on	1
seeing	1
it	1
my	1
niece	1
will	1
make	1
no	1
difficulty	1
about	1
obeying	1
it;	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
loveletter	1
thou	1
canst	1
put	1

‘_Yours	1
till	1

the	1
Knight	1
of	1
the	1

Countenance._’	1
And	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
no	1
great	1
matter	1
if	1
it	1
is	1
in	1
some	1
other	1
person’s	1
hand,	1
for	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
I	1
recollect	1
Dulcinea	1
can	1
neither	1
read	1
nor	1
write,	1
nor	1
in	1
the	1
whole	1
course	1
of	1
her	1
life	1
has	1
she	1
seen	1
handwriting	1
or	1
letter	1
of	1
mine,	1
for	1
my	1
love	1
and	1
hers	1
have	1
been	1
always	1
platonic,	1
not	1
going	1
beyond	1
a	1
modest	1
look,	1
and	1
even	1
that	1
so	1
seldom	1
that	1
I	1
can	1
safely	1
swear	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
seen	1
her	1
four	1
times	1
in	1
all	1
these	1
twelve	1
years	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
loving	1
her	1
more	1
than	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
these	1
eyes	1
that	1
the	1
earth	1
will	1
one	1
day	1
devour;	1
and	1
perhaps	1
even	1
of	1
those	1
four	1
times	1
she	1
has	1
not	1
once	1
perceived	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
looking	1
at	1
her:	1
such	1
is	1
the	1
retirement	1
and	1
seclusion	1
in	1
which	1
her	1
father	1
Lorenzo	1
Corchuelo	1
and	1
her	1
mother	1
Aldonza	1
Nogales	1
have	1
brought	1
her	1
up.”	1
“So,	1
so!”	1
said	1
Sancho;	1
“Lorenzo	1
Corchuelo’s	1
daughter	1
is	1
the	1
lady	1
Dulcinea	1
del	1
Toboso,	1
otherwise	1
called	1
Aldonza	1
Lorenzo?”	1
“She	1
it	1
is,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“and	1
she	1
it	1
is	1
that	1
is	1
worthy	1
to	1
be	1
lady	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
universe.”	1
“I	1
know	1
her	1
well,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“and	1
let	1
me	1
tell	1
you	1
she	1
can	1
fling	1
a	1
crowbar	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
the	1
lustiest	1
lad	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
town.	1
Giver	1
of	1
all	1
good!	1
but	1
she	1
is	1
a	1
brave	1
lass,	1
and	1
a	1
right	1
and	1
stout	1
one,	1
and	1
fit	1
to	1
be	1
helpmate	1
to	1
any	1
knight-errant	1
that	1
is	1
or	1
is	1
to	1
be,	1
who	1
may	1
make	1
her	1
his	1
lady:	1
the	1
whoreson	1
wench,	1
what	1
sting	1
she	1
has	1
and	1
what	1
a	1
voice!	1
I	1
can	1
tell	1
you	1
one	1
day	1
she	1
posted	1
herself	1
on	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
belfry	1
of	1
the	1
village	1
to	1
call	1
some	1
labourers	1
of	1
theirs	1
that	1
were	1
in	1
a	1
ploughed	1
field	1
of	1
her	1
father’s,	1
and	1
though	1
they	1
were	1
better	1
than	1
half	1
a	1
league	1
off	1
they	1
heard	1
her	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
if	1
they	1
were	1
at	1
the	1
foot	1
of	1
the	1
tower;	1
and	1
the	1
best	1
of	1
her	1
is	1
that	1
she	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
bit	1
prudish,	1
for	1
she	1
has	1
plenty	1
of	1
affability,	1
and	1
jokes	1
with	1
everybody,	1
and	1
has	1
a	1
grin	1
and	1
a	1
jest	1
for	1
everything.	1
So,	1
Sir	1
Knight	1
of	1
the	1
Rueful	1
Countenance,	1
I	1
say	1
you	1
not	1
only	1
may	1
and	1
ought	1
to	1
do	1
mad	1
freaks	1
for	1
her	1
sake,	1
but	1
you	1
have	1
a	1
good	1
right	1
to	1
give	1
way	1
to	1
despair	1
and	1
hang	1
yourself;	1
and	1
no	1
one	1
who	1
knows	1
of	1
it	1
but	1
will	1
say	1
you	1
did	1
well,	1
though	1
the	1
devil	1
should	1
take	1
you;	1
and	1
I	1
wish	1
I	1
were	1
on	1
my	1
road	1
already,	1
simply	1
to	1
see	1
her,	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
many	1
a	1
day	1
since	1
I	1
saw	1
her,	1
and	1
she	1
must	1
be	1
altered	1
by	1
this	1
time,	1
for	1
going	1
about	1
the	1
fields	1
always,	1
and	1
the	1
sun	1
and	1
the	1
air	1
spoil	1
women’s	1
looks	1
greatly.	1
But	1
I	1
must	1
own	1
the	1
truth	1
to	1
your	1
worship,	1
Señor	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
until	1
now	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
under	1
a	1
great	1
mistake,	1
for	1
I	1
believed	1
truly	1
and	1
honestly	1
that	1
the	1
lady	1
Dulcinea	1
must	1
be	1
some	1
princess	1
your	1
worship	1
was	1
in	1
love	1
with,	1
or	1
some	1
person	1
great	1
enough	1
to	1
deserve	1
the	1
rich	1
presents	1
you	1
have	1
sent	1
her,	1
such	1
as	1
the	1
Biscayan	1
and	1
the	1
galley	1
slaves,	1
and	1
many	1
more	1
no	1
doubt,	1
for	1
your	1
worship	1
must	1
have	1
won	1
many	1
victories	1
in	1
the	1
time	1
when	1
I	1
was	1
not	1
yet	1
your	1
squire.	1
But	1
all	1
things	1
considered,	1
what	1
good	1
can	1
it	1
do	1
the	1
lady	1
Aldonza	1
Lorenzo,	1
I	1
mean	1
the	1
lady	1
Dulcinea	1
del	1
Toboso,	1
to	1
have	1
the	1
vanquished	1
your	1
worship	1
sends	1
or	1
will	1
send	1
coming	1
to	1
her	1
and	1
going	1
down	1
on	1
their	1
knees	1
before	1
her?	1
Because	1
maybe	1
when	1
they	1
came	1
she’d	1
be	1
hackling	1
flax	1
or	1
threshing	1
on	1
the	1
threshing	1
floor,	1
and	1
they’d	1
be	1
ashamed	1
to	1
see	1
her,	1
and	1
she’d	1
laugh,	1
or	1
resent	1
the	1
present.”	1
“I	1
have	1
before	1
now	1
told	1
thee	1
many	1
times,	1
Sancho,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“that	1
thou	1
art	1
a	1
mighty	1
great	1
chatterer,	1
and	1
that	1
with	1
a	1
blunt	1
wit	1
thou	1
art	1
always	1
striving	1
at	1
sharpness;	1
but	1
to	1
show	1
thee	1
what	1
a	1
fool	1
thou	1
art	1
and	1
how	1
rational	1
I	1
am,	1
I	1
would	1
have	1
thee	1
listen	1
to	1
a	1
short	1
story.	1
Thou	1
must	1
know	1
that	1
a	1
certain	1
widow,	1
fair,	1
young,	1
independent,	1
and	1
rich,	1
and	1
above	1
all	1
free	1
and	1
easy,	1
fell	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
a	1
sturdy	1
strapping	1
young	1
lay-brother;	1
his	1
superior	1
came	1
to	1
know	1
of	1
it,	1
and	1
one	1
day	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
worthy	1
widow	1
by	1
way	1
of	1
brotherly	1
remonstrance,	1
‘I	1
am	1
surprised,	1
señora,	1
and	1
not	1
without	1
good	1
reason,	1
that	1
a	1
woman	1
of	1
such	1
high	1
standing,	1
so	1
fair,	1
and	1
so	1
rich	1
as	1
you	1
are,	1
should	1
have	1
fallen	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
such	1
a	1
mean,	1
low,	1
stupid	1
fellow	1
as	1
So-and-so,	1
when	1
in	1
this	1
house	1
there	1
are	1
so	1
many	1
masters,	1
graduates,	1
and	1
divinity	1
students	1
from	1
among	1
whom	1
you	1
might	1
choose	1
as	1
if	1
they	1
were	1
a	1
lot	1
of	1
pears,	1
saying,	1
‘This	1
one	1
I’ll	1
take,	1
that	1
I	1
won’t	1
take;’	1
but	1
she	1
replied	1
to	1
him	1
with	1
great	1
sprightliness	1
and	1
candour,	1
‘My	1
dear	1
sir,	1
you	1
are	1
very	1
much	1
mistaken,	1
and	1
your	1
ideas	1
are	1
very	1
old-fashioned,	1
if	1
you	1
think	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
made	1
a	1
bad	1
choice	1
in	1
So-and-so,	1
fool	1
as	1
he	1
seems;	1
because	1
for	1
all	1
I	1
want	1
with	1
him	1
he	1
knows	1
as	1
much	1
and	1
more	1
philosophy	1
than	1
Aristotle.’	1
In	1
the	1
same	1
way,	1
Sancho,	1
for	1
all	1
I	1
want	1
with	1
Dulcinea	1
del	1
Toboso	1
she	1
is	1
just	1
as	1
good	1
as	1
the	1
most	1
exalted	1
princess	1
on	1
earth.	1
It	1
is	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
supposed	1
that	1
all	1
those	1
poets	1
who	1
sang	1
the	1
praises	1
of	1
ladies	1
under	1
the	1
fancy	1
names	1
they	1
give	1
them,	1
had	1
any	1
such	1
mistresses.	1
Thinkest	1
thou	1
that	1
the	1
Amarillises,	1
the	1
Phillises,	1
the	1
Sylvias,	1
the	1
Dianas,	1
the	1
Galateas,	1
the	1
Fílidas,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
them,	1
that	1
the	1
books,	1
the	1
ballads,	1
the	1
barber’s	1
shops,	1
the	1
theatres	1
are	1
full	1
of,	1
were	1
really	1
and	1
truly	1
ladies	1
of	1
flesh	1
and	1
blood,	1
and	1
mistresses	1
of	1
those	1
that	1
glorify	1
and	1
have	1
glorified	1
them?	1
Nothing	1
of	1
the	1
kind;	1
they	1
only	1
invent	1
them	1
for	1
the	1
most	1
part	1
to	1
furnish	1
a	1
subject	1
for	1
their	1
verses,	1
and	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
pass	1
for	1
lovers,	1
or	1
for	1
men	1
valiant	1
enough	1
to	1
be	1
so;	1
and	1
so	1
it	1
suffices	1
me	1
to	1
think	1
and	1
believe	1
that	1
the	1
good	1
Aldonza	1
Lorenzo	1
is	1
fair	1
and	1
virtuous;	1
and	1
as	1
to	1
her	1
pedigree	1
it	1
is	1
very	1
little	1
matter,	1
for	1
no	1
one	1
will	1
examine	1
into	1
it	1
for	1
the	1
purpose	1
of	1
conferring	1
any	1
order	1
upon	1
her,	1
and	1
I,	1
for	1
my	1
part,	1
reckon	1
her	1
the	1
most	1
exalted	1
princess	1
in	1
the	1
world.	1
For	1
thou	1
shouldst	1
know,	1
Sancho,	1
if	1
thou	1
dost	1
not	1
know,	1
that	1
two	1
things	1
alone	1
beyond	1
all	1
others	1
are	1
incentives	1
to	1
love,	1
and	1
these	1
are	1
great	1
beauty	1
and	1
a	1
good	1
name,	1
and	1
these	1
two	1
things	1
are	1
to	1
be	1
found	1
in	1
Dulcinea	1
in	1
the	1
highest	1
degree,	1
for	1
in	1
beauty	1
no	1
one	1
equals	1
her	1
and	1
in	1
good	1
name	1
few	1
approach	1
her;	1
and	1
to	1
put	1
the	1
whole	1
thing	1
in	1
a	1
nutshell,	1
I	1
persuade	1
myself	1
that	1
all	1
I	1
say	1
is	1
as	1
I	1
say,	1
neither	1
more	1
nor	1
less,	1
and	1
I	1
picture	1
her	1
in	1
my	1
imagination	1
as	1
I	1
would	1
have	1
her	1
to	1
be,	1
as	1
well	1
in	1
beauty	1
as	1
in	1
condition;	1
Helen	1
approaches	1
her	1
not	1
nor	1
does	1
Lucretia	1
come	1
up	1
to	1
her,	1
nor	1
any	1
other	1
of	1
the	1
famous	1
women	1
of	1
times	1
past,	1
Greek,	1
Barbarian,	1
or	1
Latin;	1
and	1
let	1
each	1
say	1
what	1
he	1
will,	1
for	1
if	1
in	1
this	1
I	1
am	1
taken	1
to	1
task	1
by	1
the	1
ignorant,	1
I	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
censured	1
by	1
the	1
critical.”	1
“I	1
say	1
that	1
your	1
worship	1
is	1
entirely	1
right,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“and	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
an	1
ass.	1
But	1
I	1
know	1
not	1
how	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
ass	1
came	1
into	1
my	1
mouth,	1
for	1
a	1
rope	1
is	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
mentioned	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
him	1
who	1
has	1
been	1
hanged;	1
but	1
now	1
for	1
the	1
letter,	1
and	1
then,	1
God	1
be	1
with	1
you,	1
I	1
am	1
off.”	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
took	1
out	1
the	1
notebook,	1
and,	1
retiring	1
to	1
one	1
side,	1
very	1
deliberately	1
began	1
to	1
write	1
the	1
letter,	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
finished	1
it	1
he	1
called	1
to	1
Sancho,	1
saying	1
he	1
wished	1
to	1
read	1
it	1
to	1
him,	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
commit	1
it	1
to	1
memory,	1
in	1
case	1
of	1
losing	1
it	1
on	1
the	1
road;	1
for	1
with	1
evil	1
fortune	1
like	1
his	1
anything	1
might	1
be	1
apprehended.	1
To	1
which	1
Sancho	1
replied,	1
“Write	1
it	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
times	1
there	1
in	1
the	1
book	1
and	1
give	1
it	1
to	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
carry	1
it	1
very	1
carefully,	1
because	1
to	1
expect	1
me	1
to	1
keep	1
it	1
in	1
my	1
memory	1
is	1
all	1
nonsense,	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
such	1
a	1
bad	1
one	1
that	1
I	1
often	1
forget	1
my	1
own	1
name;	1
but	1
for	1
all	1
that	1
repeat	1
it	1
to	1
me,	1
as	1
I	1
shall	1
like	1
to	1
hear	1
it,	1
for	1
surely	1
it	1
will	1
run	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
was	1
in	1
print.”	1
“Listen,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“this	1
is	1
what	1
it	1
says:	1
_“Don	1

your	1
worship	1
says	1
everything	1
as	1
you	1
like	1
in	1
it!	1
And	1
how	1
well	1
you	1
fit	1
in	1
‘The	1
Knight	1
of	1
the	1
Rueful	1
Countenance’	1
into	1
the	1
signature.	1
I	1
declare	1
your	1
worship	1
is	1
indeed	1
the	1
very	1
devil,	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
nothing	1
you	1
don’t	1
know.”	1
“Everything	1
is	1
needed	1
for	1
the	1
calling	1
I	1
follow,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote.	1
“Now	1
then,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“let	1
your	1
worship	1
put	1
the	1
order	1
for	1
the	1
three	1
ass-colts	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side,	1
and	1
sign	1
it	1
very	1
plainly,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
recognise	1
it	1
at	1
first	1
sight.”	1
“With	1
all	1
my	1
heart,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
and	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
written	1
it	1
he	1
read	1
it	1
to	1
this	1
effect:	1
“Mistress	1
Niece,—By	1
this	1
first	1
of	1
ass-colts	1
please	1
pay	1
to	1
Sancho	1
Panza,	1
my	1
squire,	1
three	1
of	1
the	1
five	1
I	1
left	1
at	1
home	1
in	1
your	1
charge:	1
said	1
three	1
ass-colts	1
to	1
be	1
paid	1
and	1
delivered	1
for	1
the	1
same	1
number	1
received	1
here	1
in	1
hand,	1
which	1
upon	1
this	1
and	1
upon	1
his	1
receipt	1
shall	1
be	1
duly	1
paid.	1
Done	1
in	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
the	1
Sierra	1
Morena,	1
the	1
twenty-seventh	1
of	1
August	1
of	1
this	1
present	1
year.”	1
“That	1
will	1
do,”	1
said	1
Sancho;	1
“now	1
let	1
your	1
worship	1
sign	1
it.”	1
“There	1
is	1
no	1
need	1
to	1
sign	1
it,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“but	1
merely	1
to	1
put	1
my	1
flourish,	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
same	1
as	1
a	1
signature,	1
and	1
enough	1
for	1
three	1
asses,	1
or	1
even	1
three	1
hundred.”	1
“I	1
can	1
trust	1
your	1
worship,”	1
returned	1
Sancho;	1
“let	1
me	1
go	1
and	1
saddle	1
Rocinante,	1
and	1
be	1
ready	1
to	1
give	1
me	1
your	1
blessing,	1
for	1
I	1
mean	1
to	1
go	1
at	1
once	1
without	1
seeing	1
the	1
fooleries	1
your	1
worship	1
is	1
going	1
to	1
do;	1
I’ll	1
say	1
I	1
saw	1
you	1
do	1
so	1
many	1
that	1
she	1
will	1
not	1
want	1
any	1
more.”	1
“At	1
any	1
rate,	1
Sancho,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“I	1
should	1
like—and	1
there	1
is	1
reason	1
for	1
it—I	1
should	1
like	1
thee,	1
I	1
say,	1
to	1
see	1
me	1
stripped	1
to	1
the	1
skin	1
and	1
performing	1
a	1
dozen	1
or	1
two	1
of	1
insanities,	1
which	1
I	1
can	1
get	1
done	1
in	1
less	1
than	1
half	1
an	1
hour;	1
for	1
having	1
seen	1
them	1
with	1
thine	1
own	1
eyes,	1
thou	1
canst	1
then	1
safely	1
swear	1
to	1
the	1
rest	1
that	1
thou	1
wouldst	1
add;	1
and	1
I	1
promise	1
thee	1
thou	1
wilt	1
not	1
tell	1
of	1
as	1
many	1
as	1
I	1
mean	1
to	1
perform.”	1
“For	1
the	1
love	1
of	1
God,	1
master	1
mine,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“let	1
me	1
not	1
see	1
your	1
worship	1
stripped,	1
for	1
it	1
will	1
sorely	1
grieve	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
keep	1
from	1
tears,	1
and	1
my	1
head	1
aches	1
so	1
with	1
all	1
I	1
shed	1
last	1
night	1
for	1
Dapple,	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
fit	1
to	1
begin	1
any	1
fresh	1
weeping;	1
but	1
if	1
it	1
is	1
your	1
worship’s	1
pleasure	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
see	1
some	1
insanities,	1
do	1
them	1
in	1
your	1
clothes,	1
short	1
ones,	1
and	1
such	1
as	1
come	1
readiest	1
to	1
hand;	1
for	1
I	1
myself	1
want	1
nothing	1
of	1
the	1
sort,	1
and,	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
said,	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
a	1
saving	1
of	1
time	1
for	1
my	1
return,	1
which	1
will	1
be	1
with	1
the	1
news	1
your	1
worship	1
desires	1
and	1
deserves.	1
If	1
not,	1
let	1
the	1
lady	1
Dulcinea	1
look	1
to	1
it;	1
if	1
she	1
does	1
not	1
answer	1
reasonably,	1
I	1
swear	1
as	1
solemnly	1
as	1
I	1
can	1
that	1
I	1
will	1
fetch	1
a	1
fair	1
answer	1
out	1
of	1
her	1
stomach	1
with	1
kicks	1
and	1
cuffs;	1
for	1
why	1
should	1
it	1
be	1
borne	1
that	1
a	1
knight-errant	1
as	1
famous	1
as	1
your	1
worship	1
should	1
go	1
mad	1
without	1
rhyme	1
or	1
reason	1
for	1
a—?	1
Her	1
ladyship	1
had	1
best	1
not	1
drive	1
me	1
to	1
say	1
it,	1
for	1
by	1
God	1
I	1
will	1
speak	1
out	1
and	1
let	1
off	1
everything	1
cheap,	1
even	1
if	1
it	1
doesn’t	1
sell:	1
I	1
am	1
pretty	1
good	1
at	1
that!	1
she	1
little	1
knows	1
me;	1
faith,	1
if	1
she	1
knew	1
me	1
she’d	1
be	1
in	1
awe	1
of	1
me.”	1
“In	1
faith,	1
Sancho,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“to	1
all	1
appearance	1
thou	1
art	1
no	1
sounder	1
in	1
thy	1
wits	1
than	1
I.”	1
“I	1
am	1
not	1
so	1
mad,”	1
answered	1
Sancho,	1
“but	1
I	1
am	1
more	1
peppery;	1
but	1
apart	1
from	1
all	1
this,	1
what	1
has	1
your	1
worship	1
to	1
eat	1
until	1
I	1
come	1
back?	1
Will	1
you	1
sally	1
out	1
on	1
the	1
road	1
like	1
Cardenio	1
to	1
force	1
it	1
from	1
the	1
shepherds?”	1
“Let	1
not	1
that	1
anxiety	1
trouble	1
thee,”	1
replied	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“for	1
even	1
if	1
I	1
had	1
it	1
I	1
should	1
not	1
eat	1
anything	1
but	1
the	1
herbs	1
and	1
the	1
fruits	1
which	1
this	1
meadow	1
and	1
these	1
trees	1
may	1
yield	1
me;	1
the	1
beauty	1
of	1
this	1
business	1
of	1
mine	1
lies	1
in	1
not	1
eating,	1
and	1
in	1
performing	1
other	1
mortifications.”	1
“Do	1
you	1
know	1
what	1
I	1
am	1
afraid	1
of?”	1
said	1
Sancho	1
upon	1
this;	1
“that	1
I	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
find	1
my	1
way	1
back	1
to	1
this	1
spot	1
where	1
I	1
am	1
leaving	1
you,	1
it	1
is	1
such	1
an	1
out-of-the-way	1
place.”	1
“Observe	1
the	1
landmarks	1
well,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“for	1
I	1
will	1
try	1
not	1
to	1
go	1
far	1
from	1
this	1
neighbourhood,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
even	1
take	1
care	1
to	1
mount	1
the	1
highest	1
of	1
these	1
rocks	1
to	1
see	1
if	1
I	1
can	1
discover	1
thee	1
returning;	1
however,	1
not	1
to	1
miss	1
me	1
and	1
lose	1
thyself,	1
the	1
best	1
plan	1
will	1
be	1
to	1
cut	1
some	1
branches	1
of	1
the	1
broom	1
that	1
is	1
so	1
abundant	1
about	1
here,	1
and	1
as	1
thou	1
goest	1
to	1
lay	1
them	1
at	1
intervals	1
until	1
thou	1
hast	1
come	1
out	1
upon	1
the	1
plain;	1
these	1
will	1
serve	1
thee,	1
after	1
the	1
fashion	1
of	1
the	1
clue	1
in	1
the	1
labyrinth	1
of	1
Theseus,	1
as	1
marks	1
and	1
signs	1
for	1
finding	1
me	1
on	1
thy	1
return.”	1
“So	1
I	1
will,”	1
said	1
Sancho	1
Panza,	1
and	1
having	1
cut	1
some,	1
he	1
asked	1
his	1
master’s	1
blessing,	1
and	1
not	1
without	1
many	1
tears	1
on	1
both	1
sides,	1
took	1
his	1
leave	1
of	1
him,	1
and	1
mounting	1
Rocinante,	1
of	1
whom	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
charged	1
him	1
earnestly	1
to	1
have	1
as	1
much	1
care	1
as	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
person,	1
he	1
set	1
out	1
for	1
the	1
plain,	1
strewing	1
at	1
intervals	1
the	1
branches	1
of	1
broom	1
as	1
his	1
master	1
had	1
recommended	1
him;	1
and	1
so	1
he	1
went	1
his	1
way,	1
though	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
still	1
entreated	1
him	1
to	1
see	1
him	1
do	1
were	1
it	1
only	1
a	1
couple	1
of	1
mad	1
acts.	1
He	1
had	1
not	1
gone	1
a	1
hundred	1
paces,	1
however,	1
when	1
he	1
returned	1
and	1
said:	1
“I	1
must	1
say,	1
señor,	1
your	1
worship	1
said	1
quite	1
right,	1
that	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
swear	1
without	1
a	1
weight	1
on	1
my	1
conscience	1
that	1
I	1
had	1
seen	1
you	1
do	1
mad	1
things,	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
well	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
see	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
only	1
one;	1
though	1
in	1
your	1
worship’s	1
remaining	1
here	1
I	1
have	1
seen	1
a	1
very	1
great	1
one.”	1

“Did	1
I	1
not	1
tell	1
thee	1
so?”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote.	1
“Wait,	1
Sancho,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
do	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
saying	1
of	1
a	1
credo,”	1
and	1
pulling	1
off	1
his	1
breeches	1
in	1
all	1
haste	1
he	1
stripped	1
himself	1
to	1
his	1
skin	1
and	1
his	1
shirt,	1
and	1
then,	1
without	1
more	1
ado,	1
he	1
cut	1
a	1
couple	1
of	1
gambados	1
in	1
the	1
air,	1
and	1
a	1
couple	1
of	1
somersaults,	1
heels	1
over	1
head,	1
making	1
such	1
a	1
display	1
that,	1
not	1
to	1
see	1
it	1
a	1
second	1
time,	1
Sancho	1
wheeled	1
Rocinante	1
round,	1
and	1
felt	1
easy,	1
and	1
satisfied	1
in	1
his	1
mind	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
swear	1
he	1
had	1
left	1
his	1
master	1
mad;	1
and	1
so	1
we	1
will	1
leave	1
him	1
to	1
follow	1
his	1
road	1
until	1
his	1
return,	1
which	1
was	1
a	1
quick	1
one.	1

Returning	1
to	1
the	1
proceedings	1
of	1
him	1
of	1
the	1
Rueful	1
Countenance	1
when	1
he	1
found	1
himself	1
alone,	1
the	1
history	1
says	1
that	1
when	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
had	1
completed	1
the	1
performance	1
of	1
the	1
somersaults	1
or	1
capers,	1
naked	1
from	1
the	1
waist	1
down	1
and	1
clothed	1
from	1
the	1
waist	1
up,	1
and	1
saw	1
that	1
Sancho	1
had	1
gone	1
off	1
without	1
waiting	1
to	1
see	1
any	1
more	1
crazy	1
feats,	1
he	1
climbed	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
a	1
high	1
rock,	1
and	1
there	1
set	1
himself	1
to	1
consider	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
several	1
times	1
before	1
considered	1
without	1
ever	1
coming	1
to	1
any	1
conclusion	1
on	1
the	1
point,	1
namely	1
whether	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
better	1
and	1
more	1
to	1
his	1
purpose	1
to	1
imitate	1
the	1
outrageous	1
madness	1
of	1
Roland,	1
or	1
the	1
melancholy	1
madness	1
of	1
Amadis;	1
and	1
communing	1
with	1
himself	1
he	1
said:	1
“What	1
wonder	1
is	1
it	1
if	1
Roland	1
was	1
so	1
good	1
a	1
knight	1
and	1
so	1
valiant	1
as	1
everyone	1
says	1
he	1
was,	1
when,	1
after	1
all,	1
he	1
was	1
enchanted,	1
and	1
nobody	1
could	1
kill	1
him	1
save	1
by	1
thrusting	1
a	1
corking	1
pin	1
into	1
the	1
sole	1
of	1
his	1
foot,	1
and	1
he	1
always	1
wore	1
shoes	1
with	1
seven	1
iron	1
soles?	1
Though	1
cunning	1
devices	1
did	1
not	1
avail	1
him	1
against	1
Bernardo	1
del	1
Carpio,	1
who	1
knew	1
all	1
about	1
them,	1
and	1
strangled	1
him	1
in	1
his	1
arms	1
at	1
Roncesvalles.	1
But	1
putting	1
the	1
question	1
of	1
his	1
valour	1
aside,	1
let	1
us	1
come	1
to	1
his	1
losing	1
his	1
wits,	1
for	1
certain	1
it	1
is	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
lose	1
them	1
in	1
consequence	1
of	1
the	1
proofs	1
he	1
discovered	1
at	1
the	1
fountain,	1
and	1
the	1
intelligence	1
the	1
shepherd	1
gave	1
him	1
of	1
Angelica	1
having	1
slept	1
more	1
than	1
two	1
siestas	1
with	1
Medoro,	1
a	1
little	1
curly-headed	1
Moor,	1
and	1
page	1
to	1
Agramante.	1
If	1
he	1
was	1
persuaded	1
that	1
this	1
was	1
true,	1
and	1
that	1
his	1
lady	1
had	1
wronged	1
him,	1
it	1
is	1
no	1
wonder	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
have	1
gone	1
mad;	1
but	1
I,	1
how	1
am	1
I	1
to	1
imitate	1
him	1
in	1
his	1
madness,	1
unless	1
I	1
can	1
imitate	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
it?	1
For	1
my	1
Dulcinea,	1
I	1
will	1
venture	1
to	1
swear,	1
never	1
saw	1
a	1
Moor	1
in	1
her	1
life,	1
as	1
he	1
is,	1
in	1
his	1
proper	1
costume,	1
and	1
she	1
is	1
this	1
day	1
as	1
the	1
mother	1
that	1
bore	1
her,	1
and	1
I	1
should	1
plainly	1
be	1
doing	1
her	1
a	1
wrong	1
if,	1
fancying	1
anything	1
else,	1
I	1
were	1
to	1
go	1
mad	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
kind	1
of	1
madness	1
as	1
Roland	1
the	1
Furious.	1
On	1
the	1
other	1
hand,	1
I	1
see	1
that	1
Amadis	1
of	1
Gaul,	1
without	1
losing	1
his	1
senses	1
and	1
without	1
doing	1
anything	1
mad,	1
acquired	1
as	1
a	1
lover	1
as	1
much	1
fame	1
as	1
the	1
most	1
famous;	1
for,	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
history,	1
on	1
finding	1
himself	1
rejected	1
by	1
his	1
lady	1
Oriana,	1
who	1
had	1
ordered	1
him	1
not	1
to	1
appear	1
in	1
her	1
presence	1
until	1
it	1
should	1
be	1
her	1
pleasure,	1
all	1
he	1
did	1
was	1
to	1
retire	1
to	1
the	1
Peña	1
Pobre	1
in	1
company	1
with	1
a	1
hermit,	1
and	1
there	1
he	1
took	1
his	1
fill	1
of	1
weeping	1
until	1
Heaven	1
sent	1
him	1
relief	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
his	1
great	1
grief	1
and	1
need.	1
And	1
if	1
this	1
be	1
true,	1
as	1
it	1
is,	1
why	1
should	1
I	1
now	1
take	1
the	1
trouble	1
to	1
strip	1
stark	1
naked,	1
or	1
do	1
mischief	1
to	1
these	1
trees	1
which	1
have	1
done	1
me	1
no	1
harm,	1
or	1
why	1
am	1
I	1
to	1
disturb	1
the	1
clear	1
waters	1
of	1
these	1
brooks	1
which	1
will	1
give	1
me	1
to	1
drink	1
whenever	1
I	1
have	1
a	1
mind?	1
Long	1
live	1
the	1
memory	1
of	1
Amadis	1
and	1
let	1
him	1
be	1
imitated	1
so	1
far	1
as	1
is	1
possible	1
by	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
of	1
La	1
Mancha,	1
of	1
whom	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
said,	1
as	1
was	1
said	1
of	1
the	1
other,	1
that	1
if	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
achieve	1
great	1
things,	1
he	1
died	1
in	1
attempting	1
them;	1
and	1
if	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
repulsed	1
or	1
rejected	1
by	1
my	1
Dulcinea,	1
it	1
is	1
enough	1
for	1
me,	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
said,	1
to	1
be	1
absent	1
from	1
her.	1
And	1
so,	1
now	1
to	1
business;	1
come	1
to	1
my	1
memory	1
ye	1
deeds	1
of	1
Amadis,	1
and	1
show	1
me	1
how	1
I	1
am	1
to	1
begin	1
to	1
imitate	1
you.	1
I	1
know	1
already	1
that	1
what	1
he	1
chiefly	1
did	1
was	1
to	1
pray	1
and	1
commend	1
himself	1
to	1
God;	1
but	1
what	1
am	1
I	1
to	1
do	1
for	1
a	1
rosary,	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
got	1
one?”	1
And	1
then	1
it	1
occurred	1
to	1
him	1
how	1
he	1
might	1
make	1
one,	1
and	1
that	1
was	1
by	1
tearing	1
a	1
great	1
strip	1
off	1
the	1
tail	1
of	1
his	1
shirt	1
which	1
hung	1
down,	1
and	1
making	1
eleven	1
knots	1
on	1
it,	1
one	1
bigger	1
than	1
the	1
rest,	1
and	1
this	1
served	1
him	1
for	1
a	1
rosary	1
all	1
the	1
time	1
he	1
was	1
there,	1
during	1
which	1
he	1
repeated	1
countless	1
ave-marias.	1
But	1
what	1
distressed	1
him	1
greatly	1
was	1
not	1
having	1
another	1
hermit	1
there	1
to	1
confess	1
him	1
and	1
receive	1
consolation	1
from;	1
and	1
so	1
he	1
solaced	1
himself	1
with	1
pacing	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
the	1
little	1
meadow,	1
and	1
writing	1
and	1
carving	1
on	1
the	1
bark	1
of	1
the	1
trees	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
fine	1
sand	1
a	1
multitude	1
of	1
verses	1
all	1
in	1
harmony	1
with	1
his	1
sadness,	1
and	1
some	1
in	1
praise	1
of	1
Dulcinea;	1
but,	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
found	1
there	1
afterwards,	1
the	1
only	1
ones	1
completely	1
legible	1
that	1
could	1
be	1
discovered	1
were	1
those	1
that	1
follow	1
here:	1
Ye	1
on	1
the	1
mountainside	1
that	1
grow,	1
Ye	1
green	1
things	1
all,	1
trees,	1
shrubs,	1
and	1
bushes,	1
Are	1
ye	1
aweary	1
of	1
the	1
woe	1
That	1
this	1
poor	1
aching	1
bosom	1
crushes?	1
If	1
it	1
disturb	1
you,	1
and	1
I	1
owe	1
Some	1
reparation,	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
a	1
Defence	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
let	1
you	1
know	1
Don	1
Quixote’s	1
tears	1
are	1
on	1
the	1
flow,	1
And	1
all	1
for	1
distant	1
Dulcinea	1
Del	1
Toboso.	1
The	1
lealest	1
lover	1
time	1
can	1
show,	1
Doomed	1
for	1
a	1
lady-love	1
to	1
languish,	1
Among	1
these	1
solitudes	1
doth	1
go,	1
A	1
prey	1
to	1
every	1
kind	1
of	1
anguish.	1
Why	1
Love	1
should	1
like	1
a	1
spiteful	1
foe	1
Thus	1
use	1
him,	1
he	1
hath	1
no	1
idea,	1
But	1
hogsheads	1
full—this	1
doth	1
he	1
know—	1
Don	1
Quixote’s	1
tears	1
are	1
on	1
the	1
flow,	1
And	1
all	1
for	1
distant	1
Dulcinea	1
Del	1
Toboso.	1
Adventure-seeking	1
doth	1
he	1
go	1
Up	1
rugged	1
heights,	1
down	1
rocky	1
valleys,	1
But	1
hill	1
or	1
dale,	1
or	1
high	1
or	1
low,	1
Mishap	1
attendeth	1
all	1
his	1
sallies:	1
Love	1
still	1
pursues	1
him	1
to	1
and	1
fro,	1
And	1
plies	1
his	1
cruel	1
scourge—ah	1
me!	1
a	1
Relentless	1
fate,	1
an	1
endless	1
woe;	1
Don	1
Quixote’s	1
tears	1
are	1
on	1
the	1
flow,	1
And	1
all	1
for	1
distant	1
Dulcinea	1
Del	1
Toboso.	1
The	1
addition	1
of	1
“Del	1
Toboso”	1
to	1
Dulcinea’s	1
name	1
gave	1
rise	1
to	1
no	1
little	1
laughter	1
among	1
those	1
who	1
found	1
the	1
above	1
lines,	1
for	1
they	1
suspected	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
must	1
have	1
fancied	1
that	1
unless	1
he	1
added	1
“del	1
Toboso”	1
when	1
he	1
introduced	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Dulcinea	1
the	1
verse	1
would	1
be	1
unintelligible;	1
which	1
was	1
indeed	1
the	1
fact,	1
as	1
he	1
himself	1
afterwards	1
admitted.	1
He	1
wrote	1
many	1
more,	1
but,	1
as	1
has	1
been	1
said,	1
these	1
three	1
verses	1
were	1
all	1
that	1
could	1
be	1
plainly	1
and	1
perfectly	1
deciphered.	1
In	1
this	1
way,	1
and	1
in	1
sighing	1
and	1
calling	1
on	1
the	1
fauns	1
and	1
satyrs	1
of	1
the	1
woods	1
and	1
the	1
nymphs	1
of	1
the	1
streams,	1
and	1
Echo,	1
moist	1
and	1
mournful,	1
to	1
answer,	1
console,	1
and	1
hear	1
him,	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
in	1
looking	1
for	1
herbs	1
to	1
sustain	1
him,	1
he	1
passed	1
his	1
time	1
until	1
Sancho’s	1
return;	1
and	1
had	1
that	1
been	1
delayed	1
three	1
weeks,	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
three	1
days,	1
the	1
Knight	1
of	1
the	1
Rueful	1
Countenance	1
would	1
have	1
worn	1
such	1
an	1
altered	1
countenance	1
that	1
the	1
mother	1
that	1
bore	1
him	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
known	1
him:	1
and	1
here	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
well	1
to	1
leave	1
him,	1
wrapped	1
up	1
in	1
sighs	1
and	1
verses,	1
to	1
relate	1
how	1
Sancho	1
Panza	1
fared	1
on	1
his	1
mission.	1
As	1
for	1
him,	1
coming	1
out	1
upon	1
the	1
high	1
road,	1
he	1
made	1
for	1
El	1
Toboso,	1
and	1
the	1
next	1
day	1
reached	1
the	1
inn	1
where	1
the	1
mishap	1
of	1
the	1
blanket	1
had	1
befallen	1
him.	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
recognised	1
it	1
he	1
felt	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
were	1
once	1
more	1
living	1
through	1
the	1
air,	1
and	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
bring	1
himself	1
to	1
enter	1
it	1
though	1
it	1
was	1
an	1
hour	1
when	1
he	1
might	1
well	1
have	1
done	1
so,	1
for	1
it	1
was	1
dinner-time,	1
and	1
he	1
longed	1
to	1
taste	1
something	1
hot	1
as	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
all	1
cold	1
fare	1
with	1
him	1
for	1
many	1
days	1
past.	1
This	1
craving	1
drove	1
him	1
to	1
draw	1
near	1
to	1
the	1
inn,	1
still	1
undecided	1
whether	1
to	1
go	1
in	1
or	1
not,	1
and	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
hesitating	1
there	1
came	1
out	1
two	1
persons	1
who	1
at	1
once	1
recognised	1
him,	1
and	1
said	1
one	1
to	1
the	1
other:	1
“Señor	1
licentiate,	1
is	1
not	1
he	1
on	1
the	1
horse	1
there	1
Sancho	1
Panza	1
who,	1
our	1
adventurer’s	1
housekeeper	1
told	1
us,	1
went	1
off	1
with	1
her	1
master	1
as	1
esquire?”	1
“So	1
it	1
is,”	1
said	1
the	1
licentiate,	1
“and	1
that	1
is	1
our	1
friend	1
Don	1
Quixote’s	1
horse;”	1
and	1
if	1
they	1
knew	1
him	1
so	1
well	1
it	1
was	1
because	1
they	1
were	1
the	1
curate	1
and	1
the	1
barber	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
village,	1
the	1
same	1
who	1
had	1
carried	1
out	1
the	1
scrutiny	1
and	1
sentence	1
upon	1
the	1
books;	1
and	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
they	1
recognised	1
Sancho	1
Panza	1
and	1
Rocinante,	1
being	1
anxious	1
to	1
hear	1
of	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
they	1
approached,	1
and	1
calling	1
him	1
by	1
his	1
name	1
the	1
curate	1
said,	1
“Friend	1
Sancho	1
Panza,	1
where	1
is	1
your	1
master?”	1
Sancho	1
recognised	1
them	1
at	1
once,	1
and	1
determined	1
to	1
keep	1
secret	1
the	1
place	1
and	1
circumstances	1
where	1
and	1
under	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
left	1
his	1
master,	1
so	1
he	1
replied	1
that	1
his	1
master	1
was	1
engaged	1
in	1
a	1
certain	1
quarter	1
on	1
a	1
certain	1
matter	1
of	1
great	1
importance	1
to	1
him	1
which	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
disclose	1
for	1
the	1
eyes	1
in	1
his	1
head.	1
“Nay,	1
nay,”	1
said	1
the	1
barber,	1
“if	1
you	1
don’t	1
tell	1
us	1
where	1
he	1
is,	1
Sancho	1
Panza,	1
we	1
will	1
suspect	1
as	1
we	1
suspect	1
already,	1
that	1
you	1
have	1
murdered	1
and	1
robbed	1
him,	1
for	1
here	1
you	1
are	1
mounted	1
on	1
his	1
horse;	1
in	1
fact,	1
you	1
must	1
produce	1
the	1
master	1
of	1
the	1
hack,	1
or	1
else	1
take	1
the	1
consequences.”	1
“There	1
is	1
no	1
need	1
of	1
threats	1
with	1
me,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“for	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
a	1
man	1
to	1
rob	1
or	1
murder	1
anybody;	1
let	1
his	1
own	1
fate,	1
or	1
God	1
who	1
made	1
him,	1
kill	1
each	1
one;	1
my	1
master	1
is	1
engaged	1
very	1
much	1
to	1
his	1
taste	1
doing	1
penance	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
these	1
mountains;”	1
and	1
then,	1
offhand	1
and	1
without	1
stopping,	1
he	1
told	1
them	1
how	1
he	1
had	1
left	1
him,	1
what	1
adventures	1
had	1
befallen	1
him,	1
and	1
how	1
he	1
was	1
carrying	1
a	1
letter	1
to	1
the	1
lady	1
Dulcinea	1
del	1
Toboso,	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
Lorenzo	1
Corchuelo,	1
with	1
whom	1
he	1
was	1
over	1
head	1
and	1
ears	1
in	1
love.	1
They	1
were	1
both	1
amazed	1
at	1
what	1
Sancho	1
Panza	1
told	1
them;	1
for	1
though	1
they	1
were	1
aware	1
of	1
Don	1
Quixote’s	1
madness	1
and	1
the	1
nature	1
of	1
it,	1
each	1
time	1
they	1
heard	1
of	1
it	1
they	1
were	1
filled	1
with	1
fresh	1
wonder.	1
They	1
then	1
asked	1
Sancho	1
Panza	1
to	1
show	1
them	1
the	1
letter	1
he	1
was	1
carrying	1
to	1
the	1
lady	1
Dulcinea	1
del	1
Toboso.	1
He	1
said	1
it	1
was	1
written	1
in	1
a	1
notebook,	1
and	1
that	1
his	1
master’s	1
directions	1
were	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
have	1
it	1
copied	1
on	1
paper	1
at	1
the	1
first	1
village	1
he	1
came	1
to.	1
On	1
this	1
the	1
curate	1
said	1
if	1
he	1
showed	1
it	1
to	1
him,	1
he	1
himself	1
would	1
make	1
a	1
fair	1
copy	1
of	1
it.	1
Sancho	1
put	1
his	1
hand	1
into	1
his	1
bosom	1
in	1
search	1
of	1
the	1
notebook	1
but	1
could	1
not	1
find	1
it,	1
nor,	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
searching	1
until	1
now,	1
could	1
he	1
have	1
found	1
it,	1
for	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
had	1
kept	1
it,	1
and	1
had	1
never	1
given	1
it	1
to	1
him,	1
nor	1
had	1
he	1
himself	1
thought	1
of	1
asking	1
for	1
it.	1
When	1
Sancho	1
discovered	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
find	1
the	1
book	1
his	1
face	1
grew	1
deadly	1
pale,	1
and	1
in	1
great	1
haste	1
he	1
again	1
felt	1
his	1
body	1
all	1
over,	1
and	1
seeing	1
plainly	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
found,	1
without	1
more	1
ado	1
he	1
seized	1
his	1
beard	1
with	1
both	1
hands	1
and	1
plucked	1
away	1
half	1
of	1
it,	1
and	1
then,	1
as	1
quick	1
as	1
he	1
could	1
and	1
without	1
stopping,	1
gave	1
himself	1
half	1
a	1
dozen	1
cuffs	1
on	1
the	1
face	1
and	1
nose	1
till	1
they	1
were	1
bathed	1
in	1
blood.	1
Seeing	1
this,	1
the	1
curate	1
and	1
the	1
barber	1
asked	1
him	1
what	1
had	1
happened	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
gave	1
himself	1
such	1
rough	1
treatment.	1
“What	1
should	1
happen	1
to	1
me?”	1
replied	1
Sancho,	1
“but	1
to	1
have	1
lost	1
from	1
one	1
hand	1
to	1
the	1
other,	1
in	1
a	1
moment,	1
three	1
ass-colts,	1
each	1
of	1
them	1
like	1
a	1
castle?”	1
“How	1
is	1
that?”	1
said	1
the	1
barber.	1
“I	1
have	1
lost	1
the	1
notebook,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“that	1
contained	1
the	1
letter	1
to	1
Dulcinea,	1
and	1
an	1
order	1
signed	1
by	1
my	1
master	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
directed	1
his	1
niece	1
to	1
give	1
me	1
three	1
ass-colts	1
out	1
of	1
four	1
or	1
five	1
he	1
had	1
at	1
home;”	1
and	1
he	1
then	1
told	1
them	1
about	1
the	1
loss	1
of	1
Dapple.	1
The	1
curate	1
consoled	1
him,	1
telling	1
him	1
that	1
when	1
his	1
master	1
was	1
found	1
he	1
would	1
get	1
him	1
to	1
renew	1
the	1
order,	1
and	1
make	1
a	1
fresh	1
draft	1
on	1
paper,	1
as	1
was	1
usual	1
and	1
customary;	1
for	1
those	1
made	1
in	1
notebooks	1
were	1
never	1
accepted	1
or	1
honoured.	1
Sancho	1
comforted	1
himself	1
with	1
this,	1
and	1
said	1
if	1
that	1
were	1
so	1
the	1
loss	1
of	1
Dulcinea’s	1
letter	1
did	1
not	1
trouble	1
him	1
much,	1
for	1
he	1
had	1
it	1
almost	1
by	1
heart,	1
and	1
it	1
could	1
be	1
taken	1
down	1
from	1
him	1
wherever	1
and	1
whenever	1
they	1
liked.	1
“Repeat	1
it	1
then,	1
Sancho,”	1
said	1
the	1
barber,	1
“and	1
we	1
will	1
write	1
it	1
down	1
afterwards.”	1
Sancho	1
Panza	1
stopped	1
to	1
scratch	1
his	1
head	1
to	1
bring	1
back	1
the	1
letter	1
to	1
his	1
memory,	1
and	1
balanced	1
himself	1
now	1
on	1
one	1
foot,	1
now	1
the	1
other,	1
one	1
moment	1
staring	1
at	1
the	1
ground,	1
the	1
next	1
at	1
the	1
sky,	1
and	1
after	1
having	1
half	1
gnawed	1
off	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
a	1
finger	1
and	1
kept	1
them	1
in	1
suspense	1
waiting	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
begin,	1
he	1
said,	1
after	1
a	1
long	1
pause,	1
“By	1
God,	1
señor	1
licentiate,	1
devil	1
a	1
thing	1
can	1
I	1
recollect	1
of	1
the	1
letter;	1
but	1
it	1
said	1
at	1
the	1
beginning,	1
‘Exalted	1
and	1
scrubbing	1
Lady.’”	1
“It	1
cannot	1
have	1
said	1
‘scrubbing,’”	1
said	1
the	1
barber,	1
“but	1
‘superhuman’	1
or	1
‘sovereign.’”	1
“That	1
is	1
it,”	1
said	1
Sancho;	1
“then,	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
I	1
remember,	1
it	1
went	1
on,	1
‘The	1
wounded,	1
and	1
wanting	1
of	1
sleep,	1
and	1
the	1
pierced,	1
kisses	1
your	1
worship’s	1
hands,	1
ungrateful	1
and	1
very	1
unrecognised	1
fair	1
one;	1
and	1
it	1
said	1
something	1
or	1
other	1
about	1
health	1
and	1
sickness	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
sending	1
her;	1
and	1
from	1
that	1
it	1
went	1
tailing	1
off	1
until	1
it	1
ended	1
with	1
‘Yours	1
till	1
death,	1
the	1
Knight	1
of	1
the	1
Rueful	1
Countenance.’”	1
It	1
gave	1
them	1
no	1
little	1
amusement,	1
both	1
of	1
them,	1
to	1
see	1
what	1
a	1
good	1
memory	1
Sancho	1
had,	1
and	1
they	1
complimented	1
him	1
greatly	1
upon	1
it,	1
and	1
begged	1
him	1
to	1
repeat	1
the	1
letter	1
a	1
couple	1
of	1
times	1
more,	1
so	1
that	1
they	1
too	1
might	1
get	1
it	1
by	1
heart	1
to	1
write	1
it	1
out	1
by-and-by.	1
Sancho	1
repeated	1
it	1
three	1
times,	1
and	1
as	1
he	1
did,	1
uttered	1
three	1
thousand	1
more	1
absurdities;	1
then	1
he	1
told	1
them	1
more	1
about	1
his	1
master	1
but	1
he	1
never	1
said	1
a	1
word	1
about	1
the	1
blanketing	1
that	1
had	1
befallen	1
himself	1
in	1
that	1
inn,	1
into	1
which	1
he	1
refused	1
to	1
enter.	1
He	1
told	1
them,	1
moreover,	1
how	1
his	1
lord,	1
if	1
he	1
brought	1
him	1
a	1
favourable	1
answer	1
from	1
the	1
lady	1
Dulcinea	1
del	1
Toboso,	1
was	1
to	1
put	1
himself	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
endeavouring	1
to	1
become	1
an	1
emperor,	1
or	1
at	1
least	1
a	1
monarch;	1
for	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
so	1
settled	1
between	1
them,	1
and	1
with	1
his	1
personal	1
worth	1
and	1
the	1
might	1
of	1
his	1
arm	1
it	1
was	1
an	1
easy	1
matter	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
be	1
one:	1
and	1
how	1
on	1
becoming	1
one	1
his	1
lord	1
was	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
marriage	1
for	1
him	1
(for	1
he	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
widower	1
by	1
that	1
time,	1
as	1
a	1
matter	1
of	1
course)	1
and	1
was	1
to	1
give	1
him	1
as	1
a	1
wife	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
damsels	1
of	1
the	1
empress,	1
the	1
heiress	1
of	1
some	1
rich	1
and	1
grand	1
state	1
on	1
the	1
mainland,	1
having	1
nothing	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
islands	1
of	1
any	1
sort,	1
for	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
care	1
for	1
them	1
now.	1
All	1
this	1
Sancho	1
delivered	1
with	1
so	1
much	1
composure—wiping	1
his	1
nose	1
from	1
time	1
to	1
time—and	1
with	1
so	1
little	1
common-sense	1
that	1
his	1
two	1
hearers	1
were	1
again	1
filled	1
with	1
wonder	1
at	1
the	1
force	1
of	1
Don	1
Quixote’s	1
madness	1
that	1
could	1
run	1
away	1
with	1
this	1
poor	1
man’s	1
reason.	1
They	1
did	1
not	1
care	1
to	1
take	1
the	1
trouble	1
of	1
disabusing	1
him	1
of	1
his	1
error,	1
as	1
they	1
considered	1
that	1
since	1
it	1
did	1
not	1
in	1
any	1
way	1
hurt	1
his	1
conscience	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
better	1
to	1
leave	1
him	1
in	1
it,	1
and	1
they	1
would	1
have	1
all	1
the	1
more	1
amusement	1
in	1
listening	1
to	1
his	1
simplicities;	1
and	1
so	1
they	1
bade	1
him	1
pray	1
to	1
God	1
for	1
his	1
lord’s	1
health,	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
very	1
likely	1
and	1
a	1
very	1
feasible	1
thing	1
for	1
him	1
in	1
course	1
of	1
time	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
be	1
an	1
emperor,	1
as	1
he	1
said,	1
or	1
at	1
least	1
an	1
archbishop	1
or	1
some	1
other	1
dignitary	1
of	1
equal	1
rank.	1
To	1
which	1
Sancho	1
made	1
answer,	1
“If	1
fortune,	1
sirs,	1
should	1
bring	1
things	1
about	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
way	1
that	1
my	1
master	1
should	1
have	1
a	1
mind,	1
instead	1
of	1
being	1
an	1
emperor,	1
to	1
be	1
an	1
archbishop,	1
I	1
should	1
like	1
to	1
know	1
what	1
archbishops-errant	1
commonly	1
give	1
their	1
squires?”	1
“They	1
commonly	1
give	1
them,”	1
said	1
the	1
curate,	1
some	1
simple	1
benefice	1
or	1
cure,	1
or	1
some	1
place	1
as	1
sacristan	1
which	1
brings	1
them	1
a	1
good	1
fixed	1
income,	1
not	1
counting	1
the	1
altar	1
fees,	1
which	1
may	1
be	1
reckoned	1
at	1
as	1
much	1
more.”	1
“But	1
for	1
that,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“the	1
squire	1
must	1
be	1
unmarried,	1
and	1
must	1
know,	1
at	1
any	1
rate,	1
how	1
to	1
help	1
at	1
mass,	1
and	1
if	1
that	1
be	1
so,	1
woe	1
is	1
me,	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
married	1
already	1
and	1
I	1
don’t	1
know	1
the	1
first	1
letter	1
of	1
the	1
A	1
B	1
C.	1
What	1
will	1
become	1
of	1
me	1
if	1
my	1
master	1
takes	1
a	1
fancy	1
to	1
be	1
an	1
archbishop	1
and	1
not	1
an	1
emperor,	1
as	1
is	1
usual	1
and	1
customary	1
with	1
knights-errant?”	1
“Be	1
not	1
uneasy,	1
friend	1
Sancho,”	1
said	1
the	1
barber,	1
“for	1
we	1
will	1
entreat	1
your	1
master,	1
and	1
advise	1
him,	1
even	1
urging	1
it	1
upon	1
him	1
as	1
a	1
case	1
of	1
conscience,	1
to	1
become	1
an	1
emperor	1
and	1
not	1
an	1
archbishop,	1
because	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
easier	1
for	1
him	1
as	1
he	1
is	1
more	1
valiant	1
than	1
lettered.”	1
“So	1
I	1
have	1
thought,”	1
said	1
Sancho;	1
“though	1
I	1
can	1
tell	1
you	1
he	1
is	1
fit	1
for	1
anything:	1
what	1
I	1
mean	1
to	1
do	1
for	1
my	1
part	1
is	1
to	1
pray	1
to	1
our	1
Lord	1
to	1
place	1
him	1
where	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
best	1
for	1
him,	1
and	1
where	1
he	1
may	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
bestow	1
most	1
favours	1
upon	1
me.”	1
“You	1
speak	1
like	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
sense,”	1
said	1
the	1
curate,	1
“and	1
you	1
will	1
be	1
acting	1
like	1
a	1
good	1
Christian;	1
but	1
what	1
must	1
now	1
be	1
done	1
is	1
to	1
take	1
steps	1
to	1
coax	1
your	1
master	1
out	1
of	1
that	1
useless	1
penance	1
you	1
say	1
he	1
is	1
performing;	1
and	1
we	1
had	1
best	1
turn	1
into	1
this	1
inn	1
to	1
consider	1
what	1
plan	1
to	1
adopt,	1
and	1
also	1
to	1
dine,	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
now	1
time.”	1
Sancho	1
said	1
they	1
might	1
go	1
in,	1
but	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
wait	1
there	1
outside,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
tell	1
them	1
afterwards	1
the	1
reason	1
why	1
he	1
was	1
unwilling,	1
and	1
why	1
it	1
did	1
not	1
suit	1
him	1
to	1
enter	1
it;	1
but	1
he	1
begged	1
them	1
to	1
bring	1
him	1
out	1
something	1
to	1
eat,	1
and	1
to	1
let	1
it	1
be	1
hot,	1
and	1
also	1
to	1
bring	1
barley	1
for	1
Rocinante.	1
They	1
left	1
him	1
and	1
went	1
in,	1
and	1
presently	1
the	1
barber	1
brought	1
him	1
out	1
something	1
to	1
eat.	1
By-and-by,	1
after	1
they	1
had	1
between	1
them	1
carefully	1
thought	1
over	1
what	1
they	1
should	1
do	1
to	1
carry	1
out	1
their	1
object,	1
the	1
curate	1
hit	1
upon	1
an	1
idea	1
very	1
well	1
adapted	1
to	1
humour	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
and	1
effect	1
their	1
purpose;	1
and	1
his	1
notion,	1
which	1
he	1
explained	1
to	1
the	1
barber,	1
was	1
that	1
he	1
himself	1
should	1
assume	1
the	1
disguise	1
of	1
a	1
wandering	1
damsel,	1
while	1
the	1
other	1
should	1
try	1
as	1
best	1
he	1
could	1
to	1
pass	1
for	1
a	1
squire,	1
and	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
thus	1
proceed	1
to	1
where	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
was,	1
and	1
he,	1
pretending	1
to	1
be	1
an	1
aggrieved	1
and	1
distressed	1
damsel,	1
should	1
ask	1
a	1
favour	1
of	1
him,	1
which	1
as	1
a	1
valiant	1
knight-errant	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
refuse	1
to	1
grant;	1
and	1
the	1
favour	1
he	1
meant	1
to	1
ask	1
him	1
was	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
accompany	1
her	1
whither	1
she	1
would	1
conduct	1
him,	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
redress	1
a	1
wrong	1
which	1
a	1
wicked	1
knight	1
had	1
done	1
her,	1
while	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
she	1
should	1
entreat	1
him	1
not	1
to	1
require	1
her	1
to	1
remove	1
her	1
mask,	1
nor	1
ask	1
her	1
any	1
question	1
touching	1
her	1
circumstances	1
until	1
he	1
had	1
righted	1
her	1
with	1
the	1
wicked	1
knight.	1
And	1
he	1
had	1
no	1
doubt	1
that	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
would	1
comply	1
with	1
any	1
request	1
made	1
in	1
these	1
terms,	1
and	1
that	1
in	1
this	1
way	1
they	1
might	1
remove	1
him	1
and	1
take	1
him	1
to	1
his	1
own	1
village,	1
where	1
they	1
would	1
endeavour	1
to	1
find	1
out	1
if	1
his	1
extraordinary	1
madness	1
admitted	1
of	1
any	1
kind	1
of	1
remedy.	1

The	1
curate’s	1
plan	1
did	1
not	1
seem	1
a	1
bad	1
one	1
to	1
the	1
barber,	1
but	1
on	1
the	1
contrary	1
so	1
good	1
that	1
they	1
immediately	1
set	1
about	1
putting	1
it	1
in	1
execution.	1
They	1
begged	1
a	1
petticoat	1
and	1
hood	1
of	1
the	1
landlady,	1
leaving	1
her	1
in	1
pledge	1
a	1
new	1
cassock	1
of	1
the	1
curate’s;	1
and	1
the	1
barber	1
made	1
a	1
beard	1
out	1
of	1
a	1
grey-brown	1
or	1
red	1
ox-tail	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
landlord	1
used	1
to	1
stick	1
his	1
comb.	1
The	1
landlady	1
asked	1
them	1
what	1
they	1
wanted	1
these	1
things	1
for,	1
and	1
the	1
curate	1
told	1
her	1
in	1
a	1
few	1
words	1
about	1
the	1
madness	1
of	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
and	1
how	1
this	1
disguise	1
was	1
intended	1
to	1
get	1
him	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
mountain	1
where	1
he	1
then	1
was.	1
The	1
landlord	1
and	1
landlady	1
immediately	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
conclusion	1
that	1
the	1
madman	1
was	1
their	1
guest,	1
the	1
balsam	1
man	1
and	1
master	1
of	1
the	1
blanketed	1
squire,	1
and	1
they	1
told	1
the	1
curate	1
all	1
that	1
had	1
passed	1
between	1
him	1
and	1
them,	1
not	1
omitting	1
what	1
Sancho	1
had	1
been	1
so	1
silent	1
about.	1
Finally	1
the	1
landlady	1
dressed	1
up	1
the	1
curate	1
in	1
a	1
style	1
that	1
left	1
nothing	1
to	1
be	1
desired;	1
she	1
put	1
on	1
him	1
a	1
cloth	1
petticoat	1
with	1
black	1
velvet	1
stripes	1
a	1
palm	1
broad,	1
all	1
slashed,	1
and	1
a	1
bodice	1
of	1
green	1
velvet	1
set	1
off	1
by	1
a	1
binding	1
of	1
white	1
satin,	1
which	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
the	1
petticoat	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
made	1
in	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
king	1
Wamba.	1
The	1
curate	1
would	1
not	1
let	1
them	1
hood	1
him,	1
but	1
put	1
on	1
his	1
head	1
a	1
little	1
quilted	1
linen	1
cap	1
which	1
he	1
used	1
for	1
a	1
night-cap,	1
and	1
bound	1
his	1
forehead	1
with	1
a	1
strip	1
of	1
black	1
silk,	1
while	1
with	1
another	1
he	1
made	1
a	1
mask	1
with	1
which	1
he	1
concealed	1
his	1
beard	1
and	1
face	1
very	1
well.	1
He	1
then	1
put	1
on	1
his	1
hat,	1
which	1
was	1
broad	1
enough	1
to	1
serve	1
him	1
for	1
an	1
umbrella,	1
and	1
enveloping	1
himself	1
in	1
his	1
cloak	1
seated	1
himself	1
woman-fashion	1
on	1
his	1
mule,	1
while	1
the	1
barber	1
mounted	1
his	1
with	1
a	1
beard	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
waist	1
of	1
mingled	1
red	1
and	1
white,	1
for	1
it	1
was,	1
as	1
has	1
been	1
said,	1
the	1
tail	1
of	1
a	1
clay-red	1
ox.	1
They	1
took	1
leave	1
of	1
all,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
good	1
Maritornes,	1
who,	1
sinner	1
as	1
she	1
was,	1
promised	1
to	1
pray	1
a	1
rosary	1
of	1
prayers	1
that	1
God	1
might	1
grant	1
them	1
success	1
in	1
such	1
an	1
arduous	1
and	1
Christian	1
undertaking	1
as	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
in	1
hand.	1
But	1
hardly	1
had	1
he	1
sallied	1
forth	1
from	1
the	1
inn	1
when	1
it	1
struck	1
the	1
curate	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
doing	1
wrong	1
in	1
rigging	1
himself	1
out	1
in	1
that	1
fashion,	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
an	1
indecorous	1
thing	1
for	1
a	1
priest	1
to	1
dress	1
himself	1
that	1
way	1
even	1
though	1
much	1
might	1
depend	1
upon	1
it;	1
and	1
saying	1
so	1
to	1
the	1
barber	1
he	1
begged	1
him	1
to	1
change	1
dresses,	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
fitter	1
he	1
should	1
be	1
the	1
distressed	1
damsel,	1
while	1
he	1
himself	1
would	1
play	1
the	1
squire’s	1
part,	1
which	1
would	1
be	1
less	1
derogatory	1
to	1
his	1
dignity;	1
otherwise	1
he	1
was	1
resolved	1
to	1
have	1
nothing	1
more	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
the	1
matter,	1
and	1
let	1
the	1
devil	1
take	1
Don	1
Quixote.	1
Just	1
at	1
this	1
moment	1
Sancho	1
came	1
up,	1
and	1
on	1
seeing	1
the	1
pair	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
costume	1
he	1
was	1
unable	1
to	1
restrain	1
his	1
laughter;	1
the	1
barber,	1
however,	1
agreed	1
to	1
do	1
as	1
the	1
curate	1
wished,	1
and,	1
altering	1
their	1
plan,	1
the	1
curate	1
went	1
on	1
to	1
instruct	1
him	1
how	1
to	1
play	1
his	1
part	1
and	1
what	1
to	1
say	1
to	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
to	1
induce	1
and	1
compel	1
him	1
to	1
come	1
with	1
them	1
and	1
give	1
up	1
his	1
fancy	1
for	1
the	1
place	1
he	1
had	1
chosen	1
for	1
his	1
idle	1
penance.	1
The	1
barber	1
told	1
him	1
he	1
could	1
manage	1
it	1
properly	1
without	1
any	1
instruction,	1
and	1
as	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
care	1
to	1
dress	1
himself	1
up	1
until	1
they	1
were	1
near	1
where	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
was,	1
he	1
folded	1
up	1
the	1
garments,	1
and	1
the	1
curate	1
adjusted	1
his	1
beard,	1
and	1
they	1
set	1
out	1
under	1
the	1
guidance	1
of	1
Sancho	1
Panza,	1
who	1
went	1
along	1
telling	1
them	1
of	1
the	1
encounter	1
with	1
the	1
madman	1
they	1
met	1
in	1
the	1
Sierra,	1
saying	1
nothing,	1
however,	1
about	1
the	1
finding	1
of	1
the	1
valise	1
and	1
its	1
contents;	1
for	1
with	1
all	1
his	1
simplicity	1
the	1
lad	1
was	1
a	1
trifle	1
covetous.	1
The	1
next	1
day	1
they	1
reached	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
Sancho	1
had	1
laid	1
the	1
broom-branches	1
as	1
marks	1
to	1
direct	1
him	1
to	1
where	1
he	1
had	1
left	1
his	1
master,	1
and	1
recognising	1
it	1
he	1
told	1
them	1
that	1
here	1
was	1
the	1
entrance,	1
and	1
that	1
they	1
would	1
do	1
well	1
to	1
dress	1
themselves,	1
if	1
that	1
was	1
required	1
to	1
deliver	1
his	1
master;	1
for	1
they	1
had	1
already	1
told	1
him	1
that	1
going	1
in	1
this	1
guise	1
and	1
dressing	1
in	1
this	1
way	1
were	1
of	1
the	1
highest	1
importance	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
rescue	1
his	1
master	1
from	1
the	1
pernicious	1
life	1
he	1
had	1
adopted;	1
and	1
they	1
charged	1
him	1
strictly	1
not	1
to	1
tell	1
his	1
master	1
who	1
they	1
were,	1
or	1
that	1
he	1
knew	1
them,	1
and	1
should	1
he	1
ask,	1
as	1
ask	1
he	1
would,	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
given	1
the	1
letter	1
to	1
Dulcinea,	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
he	1
had,	1
and	1
that,	1
as	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
how	1
to	1
read,	1
she	1
had	1
given	1
an	1
answer	1
by	1
word	1
of	1
mouth,	1
saying	1
that	1
she	1
commanded	1
him,	1
on	1
pain	1
of	1
her	1
displeasure,	1
to	1
come	1
and	1
see	1
her	1
at	1
once;	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
very	1
important	1
matter	1
for	1
himself,	1
because	1
in	1
this	1
way	1
and	1
with	1
what	1
they	1
meant	1
to	1
say	1
to	1
him	1
they	1
felt	1
sure	1
of	1
bringing	1
him	1
back	1
to	1
a	1
better	1
mode	1
of	1
life	1
and	1
inducing	1
him	1
to	1
take	1
immediate	1
steps	1
to	1
become	1
an	1
emperor	1
or	1
monarch,	1
for	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
fear	1
of	1
his	1
becoming	1
an	1
archbishop.	1
All	1
this	1
Sancho	1
listened	1
to	1
and	1
fixed	1
it	1
well	1
in	1
his	1
memory,	1
and	1
thanked	1
them	1
heartily	1
for	1
intending	1
to	1
recommend	1
his	1
master	1
to	1
be	1
an	1
emperor	1
instead	1
of	1
an	1
archbishop,	1
for	1
he	1
felt	1
sure	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
bestowing	1
rewards	1
on	1
their	1
squires	1
emperors	1
could	1
do	1
more	1
than	1
archbishops-errant.	1
He	1
said,	1
too,	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
as	1
well	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
go	1
on	1
before	1
them	1
to	1
find	1
him,	1
and	1
give	1
him	1
his	1
lady’s	1
answer;	1
for	1
that	1
perhaps	1
might	1
be	1
enough	1
to	1
bring	1
him	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
place	1
without	1
putting	1
them	1
to	1
all	1
this	1
trouble.	1
They	1
approved	1
of	1
what	1
Sancho	1
proposed,	1
and	1
resolved	1
to	1
wait	1
for	1
him	1
until	1
he	1
brought	1
back	1
word	1
of	1
having	1
found	1
his	1
master.	1
Sancho	1
pushed	1
on	1
into	1
the	1
glens	1
of	1
the	1
Sierra,	1
leaving	1
them	1
in	1
one	1
through	1
which	1
there	1
flowed	1
a	1
little	1
gentle	1
rivulet,	1
and	1
where	1
the	1
rocks	1
and	1
trees	1
afforded	1
a	1
cool	1
and	1
grateful	1
shade.	1
It	1
was	1
an	1
August	1
day	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
heat	1
of	1
one,	1
and	1
the	1
heat	1
in	1
those	1
parts	1
is	1
intense,	1
and	1
the	1
hour	1
was	1
three	1
in	1
the	1
afternoon,	1
all	1
which	1
made	1
the	1
spot	1
the	1
more	1
inviting	1
and	1
tempted	1
them	1
to	1
wait	1
there	1
for	1
Sancho’s	1
return,	1
which	1
they	1
did.	1
They	1
were	1
reposing,	1
then,	1
in	1
the	1
shade,	1
when	1
a	1
voice	1
unaccompanied	1
by	1
the	1
notes	1
of	1
any	1
instrument,	1
but	1
sweet	1
and	1
pleasing	1
in	1
its	1
tone,	1
reached	1
their	1
ears,	1
at	1
which	1
they	1
were	1
not	1
a	1
little	1
astonished,	1
as	1
the	1
place	1
did	1
not	1
seem	1
to	1
them	1
likely	1
quarters	1
for	1
one	1
who	1
sang	1
so	1
well;	1
for	1
though	1
it	1
is	1
often	1
said	1
that	1
shepherds	1
of	1
rare	1
voice	1
are	1
to	1
be	1
found	1
in	1
the	1
woods	1
and	1
fields,	1
this	1
is	1
rather	1
a	1
flight	1
of	1
the	1
poet’s	1
fancy	1
than	1
the	1
truth.	1
And	1
still	1
more	1
surprised	1
were	1
they	1
when	1
they	1
perceived	1
that	1
what	1
they	1
heard	1
sung	1
were	1
the	1
verses	1
not	1
of	1
rustic	1
shepherds,	1
but	1
of	1
the	1
polished	1
wits	1
of	1
the	1
city;	1
and	1
so	1
it	1
proved,	1
for	1
the	1
verses	1
they	1
heard	1
were	1
these:	1
What	1
makes	1
my	1
quest	1
of	1
happiness	1
seem	1
vain?	1
Disdain.	1
What	1
bids	1
me	1
to	1
abandon	1
hope	1
of	1
ease?	1
Jealousies.	1
What	1
holds	1
my	1
heart	1
in	1
anguish	1
of	1
suspense?	1
Absence.	1
If	1
that	1
be	1
so,	1
then	1
for	1
my	1
grief	1
Where	1
shall	1
I	1
turn	1
to	1
seek	1
relief,	1
When	1
hope	1
on	1
every	1
side	1
lies	1
slain	1
By	1
Absence,	1
Jealousies,	1
Disdain?	1
What	1
the	1
prime	1
cause	1
of	1
all	1
my	1
woe	1
doth	1
prove?	1
Love.	1
What	1
at	1
my	1
glory	1
ever	1
looks	1
askance?	1
Chance.	1
Whence	1
is	1
permission	1
to	1
afflict	1
me	1
given?	1
Heaven.	1
If	1
that	1
be	1
so,	1
I	1
but	1
await	1
The	1
stroke	1
of	1
a	1
resistless	1
fate,	1
Since,	1
working	1
for	1
my	1
woe,	1
these	1
three,	1
Love,	1
Chance	1
and	1
Heaven,	1
in	1
league	1
I	1
see.	1
What	1
must	1
I	1
do	1
to	1
find	1
a	1
remedy?	1
Die.	1
What	1
is	1
the	1
lure	1
for	1
love	1
when	1
coy	1
and	1
strange?	1
Change.	1
What,	1
if	1
all	1
fail,	1
will	1
cure	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
sadness?	1
Madness.	1
If	1
that	1
be	1
so,	1
it	1
is	1
but	1
folly	1
To	1
seek	1
a	1
cure	1
for	1
melancholy:	1
Ask	1
where	1
it	1
lies;	1
the	1
answer	1
saith	1
In	1
Change,	1
in	1
Madness,	1
or	1
in	1
Death.	1
The	1
hour,	1
the	1
summer	1
season,	1
the	1
solitary	1
place,	1
the	1
voice	1
and	1
skill	1
of	1
the	1
singer,	1
all	1
contributed	1
to	1
the	1
wonder	1
and	1
delight	1
of	1
the	1
two	1
listeners,	1
who	1
remained	1
still	1
waiting	1
to	1
hear	1
something	1
more;	1
finding,	1
however,	1
that	1
the	1
silence	1
continued	1
some	1
little	1
time,	1
they	1
resolved	1
to	1
go	1
in	1
search	1
of	1
the	1
musician	1
who	1
sang	1
with	1
so	1
fine	1
a	1
voice;	1
but	1
just	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
about	1
to	1
do	1
so	1
they	1
were	1
checked	1
by	1
the	1
same	1
voice,	1
which	1
once	1
more	1
fell	1
upon	1
their	1
ears,	1
singing	1
this	1
SONNET	1
When	1
heavenward,	1
holy	1
Friendship,	1
thou	1
didst	1
go	1
Soaring	1
to	1
seek	1
thy	1
home	1
beyond	1
the	1
sky,	1
And	1
take	1
thy	1
seat	1
among	1
the	1
saints	1
on	1
high,	1
It	1
was	1
thy	1
will	1
to	1
leave	1
on	1
earth	1
below	1
Thy	1
semblance,	1
and	1
upon	1
it	1
to	1
bestow	1
Thy	1
veil,	1
wherewith	1
at	1
times	1
hypocrisy,	1
Parading	1
in	1
thy	1
shape,	1
deceives	1
the	1
eye,	1
And	1
makes	1
its	1
vileness	1
bright	1
as	1
virtue	1
show.	1
Friendship,	1
return	1
to	1
us,	1
or	1
force	1
the	1
cheat	1
That	1
wears	1
it	1
now,	1
thy	1
livery	1
to	1
restore,	1
By	1
aid	1
whereof	1
sincerity	1
is	1
slain.	1
If	1
thou	1
wilt	1
not	1
unmask	1
thy	1
counterfeit,	1
This	1
earth	1
will	1
be	1
the	1
prey	1
of	1
strife	1
once	1
more,	1
As	1
when	1
primæval	1
discord	1
held	1
its	1
reign.	1
The	1
song	1
ended	1
with	1
a	1
deep	1
sigh,	1
and	1
again	1
the	1
listeners	1
remained	1
waiting	1
attentively	1
for	1
the	1
singer	1
to	1
resume;	1
but	1
perceiving	1
that	1
the	1
music	1
had	1
now	1
turned	1
to	1
sobs	1
and	1
heart-rending	1
moans	1
they	1
determined	1
to	1
find	1
out	1
who	1
the	1
unhappy	1
being	1
could	1
be	1
whose	1
voice	1
was	1
as	1
rare	1
as	1
his	1
sighs	1
were	1
piteous,	1
and	1
they	1
had	1
not	1
proceeded	1
far	1
when	1
on	1
turning	1
the	1
corner	1
of	1
a	1
rock	1
they	1
discovered	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
aspect	1
and	1
appearance	1
as	1
Sancho	1
had	1
described	1
to	1
them	1
when	1
he	1
told	1
them	1
the	1
story	1
of	1
Cardenio.	1
He,	1
showing	1
no	1
astonishment	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
them,	1
stood	1
still	1
with	1
his	1
head	1
bent	1
down	1
upon	1
his	1
breast	1
like	1
one	1
in	1
deep	1
thought,	1
without	1
raising	1
his	1
eyes	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
them	1
after	1
the	1
first	1
glance	1
when	1
they	1
suddenly	1
came	1
upon	1
him.	1
The	1
curate,	1
who	1
was	1
aware	1
of	1
his	1
misfortune	1
and	1
recognised	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
description,	1
being	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
good	1
address,	1
approached	1
him	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
few	1
sensible	1
words	1
entreated	1
and	1
urged	1
him	1
to	1
quit	1
a	1
life	1
of	1
such	1
misery,	1
lest	1
he	1
should	1
end	1
it	1
there,	1
which	1
would	1
be	1
the	1
greatest	1
of	1
all	1
misfortunes.	1
Cardenio	1
was	1
then	1
in	1
his	1
right	1
mind,	1
free	1
from	1
any	1
attack	1
of	1
that	1
madness	1
which	1
so	1
frequently	1
carried	1
him	1
away,	1
and	1
seeing	1
them	1
dressed	1
in	1
a	1
fashion	1
so	1
unusual	1
among	1
the	1
frequenters	1
of	1
those	1
wilds,	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
showing	1
some	1
surprise,	1
especially	1
when	1
he	1
heard	1
them	1
speak	1
of	1
his	1
case	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
a	1
well-known	1
matter	1
(for	1
the	1
curate’s	1
words	1
gave	1
him	1
to	1
understand	1
as	1
much)	1
so	1
he	1
replied	1
to	1
them	1
thus:	1
“I	1
see	1
plainly,	1
sirs,	1
whoever	1
you	1
may	1
be,	1
that	1
Heaven,	1
whose	1
care	1
it	1
is	1
to	1
succour	1
the	1
good,	1
and	1
even	1
the	1
wicked	1
very	1
often,	1
here,	1
in	1
this	1
remote	1
spot,	1
cut	1
off	1
from	1
human	1
intercourse,	1
sends	1
me,	1
though	1
I	1
deserve	1
it	1
not,	1
those	1
who	1
seek	1
to	1
draw	1
me	1
away	1
from	1
this	1
to	1
some	1
better	1
retreat,	1
showing	1
me	1
by	1
many	1
and	1
forcible	1
arguments	1
how	1
unreasonably	1
I	1
act	1
in	1
leading	1
the	1
life	1
I	1
do;	1
but	1
as	1
they	1
know,	1
that	1
if	1
I	1
escape	1
from	1
this	1
evil	1
I	1
shall	1
fall	1
into	1
another	1
still	1
greater,	1
perhaps	1
they	1
will	1
set	1
me	1
down	1
as	1
a	1
weak-minded	1
man,	1
or,	1
what	1
is	1
worse,	1
one	1
devoid	1
of	1
reason;	1
nor	1
would	1
it	1
be	1
any	1
wonder,	1
for	1
I	1
myself	1
can	1
perceive	1
that	1
the	1
effect	1
of	1
the	1
recollection	1
of	1
my	1
misfortunes	1
is	1
so	1
great	1
and	1
works	1
so	1
powerfully	1
to	1
my	1
ruin,	1
that	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
myself	1
I	1
become	1
at	1
times	1
like	1
a	1
stone,	1
without	1
feeling	1
or	1
consciousness;	1
and	1
I	1
come	1
to	1
feel	1
the	1
truth	1
of	1
it	1
when	1
they	1
tell	1
me	1
and	1
show	1
me	1
proofs	1
of	1
the	1
things	1
I	1
have	1
done	1
when	1
the	1
terrible	1
fit	1
overmasters	1
me;	1
and	1
all	1
I	1
can	1
do	1
is	1
bewail	1
my	1
lot	1
in	1
vain,	1
and	1
idly	1
curse	1
my	1
destiny,	1
and	1
plead	1
for	1
my	1
madness	1
by	1
telling	1
how	1
it	1
was	1
caused,	1
to	1
any	1
that	1
care	1
to	1
hear	1
it;	1
for	1
no	1
reasonable	1
beings	1
on	1
learning	1
the	1
cause	1
will	1
wonder	1
at	1
the	1
effects;	1
and	1
if	1
they	1
cannot	1
help	1
me	1
at	1
least	1
they	1
will	1
not	1
blame	1
me,	1
and	1
the	1
repugnance	1
they	1
feel	1
at	1
my	1
wild	1
ways	1
will	1
turn	1
into	1
pity	1
for	1
my	1
woes.	1
If	1
it	1
be,	1
sirs,	1
that	1
you	1
are	1
here	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
design	1
as	1
others	1
have	1
come	1
with,	1
before	1
you	1
proceed	1
with	1
your	1
wise	1
arguments,	1
I	1
entreat	1
you	1
to	1
hear	1
the	1
story	1
of	1
my	1
countless	1
misfortunes,	1
for	1
perhaps	1
when	1
you	1
have	1
heard	1
it	1
you	1
will	1
spare	1
yourselves	1
the	1
trouble	1
you	1
would	1
take	1
in	1
offering	1
consolation	1
to	1
grief	1
that	1
is	1
beyond	1
the	1
reach	1
of	1
it.”	1
As	1
they,	1
both	1
of	1
them,	1
desired	1
nothing	1
more	1
than	1
to	1
hear	1
from	1
his	1
own	1
lips	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
his	1
suffering,	1
they	1
entreated	1
him	1
to	1
tell	1
it,	1
promising	1
not	1
to	1
do	1
anything	1
for	1
his	1
relief	1
or	1
comfort	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
wish;	1
and	1
thereupon	1
the	1
unhappy	1
gentleman	1
began	1
his	1
sad	1
story	1
in	1
nearly	1
the	1
same	1
words	1
and	1
manner	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
related	1
it	1
to	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
and	1
the	1
goatherd	1
a	1
few	1
days	1
before,	1
when,	1
through	1
Master	1
Elisabad,	1
and	1
Don	1
Quixote’s	1
scrupulous	1
observance	1
of	1
what	1
was	1
due	1
to	1
chivalry,	1
the	1
tale	1
was	1
left	1
unfinished,	1
as	1
this	1
history	1
has	1
already	1
recorded;	1
but	1
now	1
fortunately	1
the	1
mad	1
fit	1
kept	1
off,	1
allowed	1
him	1
to	1
tell	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
end;	1
and	1
so,	1
coming	1
to	1
the	1
incident	1
of	1
the	1
note	1
which	1
Don	1
Fernando	1
had	1
found	1
in	1
the	1
volume	1
of	1
“Amadis	1
of	1
Gaul,”	1
Cardenio	1
said	1
that	1
he	1
remembered	1
it	1
perfectly	1
and	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
in	1
these	1
words:	1
“_Luscinda	1
to	1
Cardenio._	1
“Every	1
day	1
I	1
discover	1
merits	1
in	1
you	1
that	1
oblige	1
and	1
compel	1
me	1
to	1
hold	1
you	1
in	1
higher	1
estimation;	1
so	1
if	1
you	1
desire	1
to	1
relieve	1
me	1
of	1
this	1
obligation	1
without	1
cost	1
to	1
my	1
honour,	1
you	1
may	1
easily	1
do	1
so.	1
I	1
have	1
a	1
father	1
who	1
knows	1
you	1
and	1
loves	1
me	1
dearly,	1
who	1
without	1
putting	1
any	1
constraint	1
on	1
my	1
inclination	1
will	1
grant	1
what	1
will	1
be	1
reasonable	1
for	1
you	1
to	1
have,	1
if	1
it	1
be	1
that	1
you	1
value	1
me	1
as	1
you	1
say	1
and	1
as	1
I	1
believe	1
you	1
do.”	1
“By	1
this	1
letter	1
I	1
was	1
induced,	1
as	1
I	1
told	1
you,	1
to	1
demand	1
Luscinda	1
for	1
my	1
wife,	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
through	1
it	1
that	1
Luscinda	1
came	1
to	1
be	1
regarded	1
by	1
Don	1
Fernando	1
as	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
discreet	1
and	1
prudent	1
women	1
of	1
the	1
day,	1
and	1
this	1
letter	1
it	1
was	1
that	1
suggested	1
his	1
design	1
of	1
ruining	1
me	1
before	1
mine	1
could	1
be	1
carried	1
into	1
effect.	1
I	1
told	1
Don	1
Fernando	1
that	1
all	1
Luscinda’s	1
father	1
was	1
waiting	1
for	1
was	1
that	1
mine	1
should	1
ask	1
her	1
of	1
him,	1
which	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
dare	1
to	1
suggest	1
to	1
him,	1
fearing	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
consent	1
to	1
do	1
so;	1
not	1
because	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
perfectly	1
well	1
the	1
rank,	1
goodness,	1
virtue,	1
and	1
beauty	1
of	1
Luscinda,	1
and	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
qualities	1
that	1
would	1
do	1
honour	1
to	1
any	1
family	1
in	1
Spain,	1
but	1
because	1
I	1
was	1
aware	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
wish	1
me	1
to	1
marry	1
so	1
soon,	1
before	1
seeing	1
what	1
the	1
Duke	1
Ricardo	1
would	1
do	1
for	1
me.	1
In	1
short,	1
I	1
told	1
him	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
venture	1
to	1
mention	1
it	1
to	1
my	1
father,	1
as	1
well	1
on	1
account	1
of	1
that	1
difficulty,	1
as	1
of	1
many	1
others	1
that	1
discouraged	1
me	1
though	1
I	1
knew	1
not	1
well	1
what	1
they	1
were,	1
only	1
that	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
me	1
that	1
what	1
I	1
desired	1
was	1
never	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
pass.	1
To	1
all	1
this	1
Don	1
Fernando	1
answered	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
take	1
it	1
upon	1
himself	1
to	1
speak	1
to	1
my	1
father,	1
and	1
persuade	1
him	1
to	1
speak	1
to	1
Luscinda’s	1
father.	1
O,	1
ambitious	1
Marius!	1
O,	1
cruel	1
Catiline!	1
O,	1
wicked	1
Sylla!	1
O,	1
perfidious	1
Ganelon!	1
O,	1
treacherous	1
Vellido!	1
O,	1
vindictive	1
Julian!	1
O,	1
covetous	1
Judas!	1
Traitor,	1
cruel,	1
vindictive,	1
and	1
perfidious,	1
wherein	1
had	1
this	1
poor	1
wretch	1
failed	1
in	1
his	1
fidelity,	1
who	1
with	1
such	1
frankness	1
showed	1
thee	1
the	1
secrets	1
and	1
the	1
joys	1
of	1
his	1
heart?	1
What	1
offence	1
did	1
I	1
commit?	1
What	1
words	1
did	1
I	1
utter,	1
or	1
what	1
counsels	1
did	1
I	1
give	1
that	1
had	1
not	1
the	1
furtherance	1
of	1
thy	1
honour	1
and	1
welfare	1
for	1
their	1
aim?	1
But,	1
woe	1
is	1
me,	1
wherefore	1
do	1
I	1
complain?	1
for	1
sure	1
it	1
is	1
that	1
when	1
misfortunes	1
spring	1
from	1
the	1
stars,	1
descending	1
from	1
on	1
high	1
they	1
fall	1
upon	1
us	1
with	1
such	1
fury	1
and	1
violence	1
that	1
no	1
power	1
on	1
earth	1
can	1
check	1
their	1
course	1
nor	1
human	1
device	1
stay	1
their	1
coming.	1
Who	1
could	1
have	1
thought	1
that	1
Don	1
Fernando,	1
a	1
highborn	1
gentleman,	1
intelligent,	1
bound	1
to	1
me	1
by	1
gratitude	1
for	1
my	1
services,	1
one	1
that	1
could	1
win	1
the	1
object	1
of	1
his	1
love	1
wherever	1
he	1
might	1
set	1
his	1
affections,	1
could	1
have	1
become	1
so	1
obdurate,	1
as	1
they	1
say,	1
as	1
to	1
rob	1
me	1
of	1
my	1
one	1
ewe	1
lamb	1
that	1
was	1
not	1
even	1
yet	1
in	1
my	1
possession?	1
But	1
laying	1
aside	1
these	1
useless	1
and	1
unavailing	1
reflections,	1
let	1
us	1
take	1
up	1
the	1
broken	1
thread	1
of	1
my	1
unhappy	1
story.	1
“To	1
proceed,	1
then:	1
Don	1
Fernando	1
finding	1
my	1
presence	1
an	1
obstacle	1
to	1
the	1
execution	1
of	1
his	1
treacherous	1
and	1
wicked	1
design,	1
resolved	1
to	1
send	1
me	1
to	1
his	1
elder	1
brother	1
under	1
the	1
pretext	1
of	1
asking	1
money	1
from	1
him	1
to	1
pay	1
for	1
six	1
horses	1
which,	1
purposely,	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
sole	1
object	1
of	1
sending	1
me	1
away	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
the	1
better	1
carry	1
out	1
his	1
infernal	1
scheme,	1
he	1
had	1
purchased	1
the	1
very	1
day	1
he	1
offered	1
to	1
speak	1
to	1
my	1
father,	1
and	1
the	1
price	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
now	1
desired	1
me	1
to	1
fetch.	1
Could	1
I	1
have	1
anticipated	1
this	1
treachery?	1
Could	1
I	1
by	1
any	1
chance	1
have	1
suspected	1
it?	1
Nay;	1
so	1
far	1
from	1
that,	1
I	1
offered	1
with	1
the	1
greatest	1
pleasure	1
to	1
go	1
at	1
once,	1
in	1
my	1
satisfaction	1
at	1
the	1
good	1
bargain	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
made.	1
That	1
night	1
I	1
spoke	1
with	1
Luscinda,	1
and	1
told	1
her	1
what	1
had	1
been	1
agreed	1
upon	1
with	1
Don	1
Fernando,	1
and	1
how	1
I	1
had	1
strong	1
hopes	1
of	1
our	1
fair	1
and	1
reasonable	1
wishes	1
being	1
realised.	1
She,	1
as	1
unsuspicious	1
as	1
I	1
was	1
of	1
the	1
treachery	1
of	1
Don	1
Fernando,	1
bade	1
me	1
try	1
to	1
return	1
speedily,	1
as	1
she	1
believed	1
the	1
fulfilment	1
of	1
our	1
desires	1
would	1
be	1
delayed	1
only	1
so	1
long	1
as	1
my	1
father	1
put	1
off	1
speaking	1
to	1
hers.	1
I	1
know	1
not	1
why	1
it	1
was	1
that	1
on	1
saying	1
this	1
to	1
me	1
her	1
eyes	1
filled	1
with	1
tears,	1
and	1
there	1
came	1
a	1
lump	1
in	1
her	1
throat	1
that	1
prevented	1
her	1
from	1
uttering	1
a	1
word	1
of	1
many	1
more	1
that	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
me	1
she	1
was	1
striving	1
to	1
say	1
to	1
me.	1
I	1
was	1
astonished	1
at	1
this	1
unusual	1
turn,	1
which	1
I	1
never	1
before	1
observed	1
in	1
her.	1
for	1
we	1
always	1
conversed,	1
whenever	1
good	1
fortune	1
and	1
my	1
ingenuity	1
gave	1
us	1
the	1
chance,	1
with	1
the	1
greatest	1
gaiety	1
and	1
cheerfulness,	1
mingling	1
tears,	1
sighs,	1
jealousies,	1
doubts,	1
or	1
fears	1
with	1
our	1
words;	1
it	1
was	1
all	1
on	1
my	1
part	1
a	1
eulogy	1
of	1
my	1
good	1
fortune	1
that	1
Heaven	1
should	1
have	1
given	1
her	1
to	1
me	1
for	1
my	1
mistress;	1
I	1
glorified	1
her	1
beauty,	1
I	1
extolled	1
her	1
worth	1
and	1
her	1
understanding;	1
and	1
she	1
paid	1
me	1
back	1
by	1
praising	1
in	1
me	1
what	1
in	1
her	1
love	1
for	1
me	1
she	1
thought	1
worthy	1
of	1
praise;	1
and	1
besides	1
we	1
had	1
a	1
hundred	1
thousand	1
trifles	1
and	1
doings	1
of	1
our	1
neighbours	1
and	1
acquaintances	1
to	1
talk	1
about,	1
and	1
the	1
utmost	1
extent	1
of	1
my	1
boldness	1
was	1
to	1
take,	1
almost	1
by	1
force,	1
one	1
of	1
her	1
fair	1
white	1
hands	1
and	1
carry	1
it	1
to	1
my	1
lips,	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
the	1
closeness	1
of	1
the	1
low	1
grating	1
that	1
separated	1
us	1
allowed	1
me.	1
But	1
the	1
night	1
before	1
the	1
unhappy	1
day	1
of	1
my	1
departure	1
she	1
wept,	1
she	1
moaned,	1
she	1
sighed,	1
and	1
she	1
withdrew	1
leaving	1
me	1
filled	1
with	1
perplexity	1
and	1
amazement,	1
overwhelmed	1
at	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
such	1
strange	1
and	1
affecting	1
signs	1
of	1
grief	1
and	1
sorrow	1
in	1
Luscinda;	1
but	1
not	1
to	1
dash	1
my	1
hopes	1
I	1
ascribed	1
it	1
all	1
to	1
the	1
depth	1
of	1
her	1
love	1
for	1
me	1
and	1
the	1
pain	1
that	1
separation	1
gives	1
those	1
who	1
love	1
tenderly.	1
At	1
last	1
I	1
took	1
my	1
departure,	1
sad	1
and	1
dejected,	1
my	1
heart	1
filled	1
with	1
fancies	1
and	1
suspicions,	1
but	1
not	1
knowing	1
well	1
what	1
it	1
was	1
I	1
suspected	1
or	1
fancied;	1
plain	1
omens	1
pointing	1
to	1
the	1
sad	1
event	1
and	1
misfortune	1
that	1
was	1
awaiting	1
me.	1
“I	1
reached	1
the	1
place	1
whither	1
I	1
had	1
been	1
sent,	1
gave	1
the	1
letter	1
to	1
Don	1
Fernando’s	1
brother,	1
and	1
was	1
kindly	1
received	1
but	1
not	1
promptly	1
dismissed,	1
for	1
he	1
desired	1
me	1
to	1
wait,	1
very	1
much	1
against	1
my	1
will,	1
eight	1
days	1
in	1
some	1
place	1
where	1
the	1
duke	1
his	1
father	1
was	1
not	1
likely	1
to	1
see	1
me,	1
as	1
his	1
brother	1
wrote	1
that	1
the	1
money	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
sent	1
without	1
his	1
knowledge;	1
all	1
of	1
which	1
was	1
a	1
scheme	1
of	1
the	1
treacherous	1
Don	1
Fernando,	1
for	1
his	1
brother	1
had	1
no	1
want	1
of	1
money	1
to	1
enable	1
him	1
to	1
despatch	1
me	1
at	1
once.	1
“The	1
command	1
was	1
one	1
that	1
exposed	1
me	1
to	1
the	1
temptation	1
of	1
disobeying	1
it,	1
as	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
me	1
impossible	1
to	1
endure	1
life	1
for	1
so	1
many	1
days	1
separated	1
from	1
Luscinda,	1
especially	1
after	1
leaving	1
her	1
in	1
the	1
sorrowful	1
mood	1
I	1
have	1
described	1
to	1
you;	1
nevertheless	1
as	1
a	1
dutiful	1
servant	1
I	1
obeyed,	1
though	1
I	1
felt	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
at	1
the	1
cost	1
of	1
my	1
well-being.	1
But	1
four	1
days	1
later	1
there	1
came	1
a	1
man	1
in	1
quest	1
of	1
me	1
with	1
a	1
letter	1
which	1
he	1
gave	1
me,	1
and	1
which	1
by	1
the	1
address	1
I	1
perceived	1
to	1
be	1
from	1
Luscinda,	1
as	1
the	1
writing	1
was	1
hers.	1
I	1
opened	1
it	1
with	1
fear	1
and	1
trepidation,	1
persuaded	1
that	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
something	1
serious	1
that	1
had	1
impelled	1
her	1
to	1
write	1
to	1
me	1
when	1
at	1
a	1
distance,	1
as	1
she	1
seldom	1
did	1
so	1
when	1
I	1
was	1
near.	1
Before	1
reading	1
it	1
I	1
asked	1
the	1
man	1
who	1
it	1
was	1
that	1
had	1
given	1
it	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
how	1
long	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
upon	1
the	1
road;	1
he	1
told	1
me	1
that	1
as	1
he	1
happened	1
to	1
be	1
passing	1
through	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
streets	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
at	1
the	1
hour	1
of	1
noon,	1
a	1
very	1
beautiful	1
lady	1
called	1
to	1
him	1
from	1
a	1
window,	1
and	1
with	1
tears	1
in	1
her	1
eyes	1
said	1
to	1
him	1
hurriedly,	1
‘Brother,	1
if	1
you	1
are,	1
as	1
you	1
seem	1
to	1
be,	1
a	1
Christian,	1
for	1
the	1
love	1
of	1
God	1
I	1
entreat	1
you	1
to	1
have	1
this	1
letter	1
despatched	1
without	1
a	1
moment’s	1
delay	1
to	1
the	1
place	1
and	1
person	1
named	1
in	1
the	1
address,	1
all	1
which	1
is	1
well	1
known,	1
and	1
by	1
this	1
you	1
will	1
render	1
a	1
great	1
service	1
to	1
our	1
Lord;	1
and	1
that	1
you	1
may	1
be	1
at	1
no	1
inconvenience	1
in	1
doing	1
so	1
take	1
what	1
is	1
in	1
this	1
handkerchief;’	1
and	1
said	1
he,	1
‘with	1
this	1
she	1
threw	1
me	1
a	1
handkerchief	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
window	1
in	1
which	1
were	1
tied	1
up	1
a	1
hundred	1
reals	1
and	1
this	1
gold	1
ring	1
which	1
I	1
bring	1
here	1
together	1
with	1
the	1
letter	1
I	1
have	1
given	1
you.	1
And	1
then	1
without	1
waiting	1
for	1
any	1
answer	1
she	1
left	1
the	1
window,	1
though	1
not	1
before	1
she	1
saw	1
me	1
take	1
the	1
letter	1
and	1
the	1
handkerchief,	1
and	1
I	1
had	1
by	1
signs	1
let	1
her	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
would	1
do	1
as	1
she	1
bade	1
me;	1
and	1
so,	1
seeing	1
myself	1
so	1
well	1
paid	1
for	1
the	1
trouble	1
I	1
would	1
have	1
in	1
bringing	1
it	1
to	1
you,	1
and	1
knowing	1
by	1
the	1
address	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
to	1
you	1
it	1
was	1
sent	1
(for,	1
señor,	1
I	1
know	1
you	1
very	1
well),	1
and	1
also	1
unable	1
to	1
resist	1
that	1
beautiful	1
lady’s	1
tears,	1
I	1
resolved	1
to	1
trust	1
no	1
one	1
else,	1
but	1
to	1
come	1
myself	1
and	1
give	1
it	1
to	1
you,	1
and	1
in	1
sixteen	1
hours	1
from	1
the	1
time	1
when	1
it	1
was	1
given	1
me	1
I	1
have	1
made	1
the	1
journey,	1
which,	1
as	1
you	1
know,	1
is	1
eighteen	1
leagues.’	1
“All	1
the	1
while	1
the	1
good-natured	1
improvised	1
courier	1
was	1
telling	1
me	1
this,	1
I	1
hung	1
upon	1
his	1
words,	1
my	1
legs	1
trembling	1
under	1
me	1
so	1
that	1
I	1
could	1
scarcely	1
stand.	1
However,	1
I	1
opened	1
the	1
letter	1
and	1
read	1
these	1
words:	1
The	1
promise	1
Don	1
Fernando	1
gave	1
you	1
to	1
urge	1
your	1
father	1
to	1
speak	1
to	1
mine,	1
he	1
has	1
fulfilled	1
much	1
more	1
to	1
his	1
own	1
satisfaction	1
than	1
to	1
your	1
advantage.	1
I	1
have	1
to	1
tell	1
you,	1
señor,	1
that	1
he	1
has	1
demanded	1
me	1
for	1
a	1
wife,	1
and	1
my	1
father,	1
led	1
away	1
by	1
what	1
he	1
considers	1
Don	1
Fernando’s	1
superiority	1
over	1
you,	1
has	1
favoured	1
his	1
suit	1
so	1
cordially,	1
that	1
in	1
two	1
days	1
hence	1
the	1
betrothal	1
is	1
to	1
take	1
place	1
with	1
such	1
secrecy	1
and	1
so	1
privately	1
that	1
the	1
only	1
witnesses	1
are	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
Heavens	1
above	1
and	1
a	1
few	1
of	1
the	1
household.	1
Picture	1
to	1
yourself	1
the	1
state	1
I	1
am	1
in;	1
judge	1
if	1
it	1
be	1
urgent	1
for	1
you	1
to	1
come;	1
the	1
issue	1
of	1
the	1
affair	1
will	1
show	1
you	1
whether	1
I	1
love	1
you	1
or	1
not.	1
God	1
grant	1
this	1
may	1
come	1
to	1
your	1
hand	1
before	1
mine	1
shall	1
be	1
forced	1
to	1
link	1
itself	1
with	1
his	1
who	1
keeps	1
so	1
ill	1
the	1
faith	1
that	1
he	1
has	1
pledged.	1
“Such,	1
in	1
brief,	1
were	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
letter,	1
words	1
that	1
made	1
me	1
set	1
out	1
at	1
once	1
without	1
waiting	1
any	1
longer	1
for	1
reply	1
or	1
money;	1
for	1
I	1
now	1
saw	1
clearly	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
the	1
purchase	1
of	1
horses	1
but	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
pleasure	1
that	1
had	1
made	1
Don	1
Fernando	1
send	1
me	1
to	1
his	1
brother.	1
The	1
exasperation	1
I	1
felt	1
against	1
Don	1
Fernando,	1
joined	1
with	1
the	1
fear	1
of	1
losing	1
the	1
prize	1
I	1
had	1
won	1
by	1
so	1
many	1
years	1
of	1
love	1
and	1
devotion,	1
lent	1
me	1
wings;	1
so	1
that	1
almost	1
flying	1
I	1
reached	1
home	1
the	1
same	1
day,	1
by	1
the	1
hour	1
which	1
served	1
for	1
speaking	1
with	1
Luscinda.	1
I	1
arrived	1
unobserved,	1
and	1
left	1
the	1
mule	1
on	1
which	1
I	1
had	1
come	1
at	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
worthy	1
man	1
who	1
had	1
brought	1
me	1
the	1
letter,	1
and	1
fortune	1
was	1
pleased	1
to	1
be	1
for	1
once	1
so	1
kind	1
that	1
I	1
found	1
Luscinda	1
at	1
the	1
grating	1
that	1
was	1
the	1
witness	1
of	1
our	1
loves.	1
She	1
recognised	1
me	1
at	1
once,	1
and	1
I	1
her,	1
but	1
not	1
as	1
she	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
recognised	1
me,	1
or	1
I	1
her.	1
But	1
who	1
is	1
there	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
that	1
can	1
boast	1
of	1
having	1
fathomed	1
or	1
understood	1
the	1
wavering	1
mind	1
and	1
unstable	1
nature	1
of	1
a	1
woman?	1
Of	1
a	1
truth	1
no	1
one.	1
To	1
proceed:	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
Luscinda	1
saw	1
me	1
she	1
said,	1
‘Cardenio,	1
I	1
am	1
in	1
my	1
bridal	1
dress,	1
and	1
the	1
treacherous	1
Don	1
Fernando	1
and	1
my	1
covetous	1
father	1
are	1
waiting	1
for	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
hall	1
with	1
the	1
other	1
witnesses,	1
who	1
shall	1
be	1
the	1
witnesses	1
of	1
my	1
death	1
before	1
they	1
witness	1
my	1
betrothal.	1
Be	1
not	1
distressed,	1
my	1
friend,	1
but	1
contrive	1
to	1
be	1
present	1
at	1
this	1
sacrifice,	1
and	1
if	1
that	1
cannot	1
be	1
prevented	1
by	1
my	1
words,	1
I	1
have	1
a	1
dagger	1
concealed	1
which	1
will	1
prevent	1
more	1
deliberate	1
violence,	1
putting	1
an	1
end	1
to	1
my	1
life	1
and	1
giving	1
thee	1
a	1
first	1
proof	1
of	1
the	1
love	1
I	1
have	1
borne	1
and	1
bear	1
thee.’	1
I	1
replied	1
to	1
her	1
distractedly	1
and	1
hastily,	1
in	1
fear	1
lest	1
I	1
should	1
not	1
have	1
time	1
to	1
reply,	1
‘May	1
thy	1
words	1
be	1
verified	1
by	1
thy	1
deeds,	1
lady;	1
and	1
if	1
thou	1
hast	1
a	1
dagger	1
to	1
save	1
thy	1
honour,	1
I	1
have	1
a	1
sword	1
to	1
defend	1
thee	1
or	1
kill	1
myself	1
if	1
fortune	1
be	1
against	1
us.’	1
“I	1
think	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
heard	1
all	1
these	1
words,	1
for	1
I	1
perceived	1
that	1
they	1
called	1
her	1
away	1
in	1
haste,	1
as	1
the	1
bridegroom	1
was	1
waiting.	1
Now	1
the	1
night	1
of	1
my	1
sorrow	1
set	1
in,	1
the	1
sun	1
of	1
my	1
happiness	1
went	1
down,	1
I	1
felt	1
my	1
eyes	1
bereft	1
of	1
sight,	1
my	1
mind	1
of	1
reason.	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
enter	1
the	1
house,	1
nor	1
was	1
I	1
capable	1
of	1
any	1
movement;	1
but	1
reflecting	1
how	1
important	1
it	1
was	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
present	1
at	1
what	1
might	1
take	1
place	1
on	1
the	1
occasion,	1
I	1
nerved	1
myself	1
as	1
best	1
I	1
could	1
and	1
went	1
in,	1
for	1
I	1
well	1
knew	1
all	1
the	1
entrances	1
and	1
outlets;	1
and	1
besides,	1
with	1
the	1
confusion	1
that	1
in	1
secret	1
pervaded	1
the	1
house	1
no	1
one	1
took	1
notice	1
of	1
me,	1
so,	1
without	1
being	1
seen,	1
I	1
found	1
an	1
opportunity	1
of	1
placing	1
myself	1
in	1
the	1
recess	1
formed	1
by	1
a	1
window	1
of	1
the	1
hall	1
itself,	1
and	1
concealed	1
by	1
the	1
ends	1
and	1
borders	1
of	1
two	1
tapestries,	1
from	1
between	1
which	1
I	1
could,	1
without	1
being	1
seen,	1
see	1
all	1
that	1
took	1
place	1
in	1
the	1
room.	1
Who	1
could	1
describe	1
the	1
agitation	1
of	1
heart	1
I	1
suffered	1
as	1
I	1
stood	1
there—the	1
thoughts	1
that	1
came	1
to	1
me—the	1
reflections	1
that	1
passed	1
through	1
my	1
mind?	1
They	1
were	1
such	1
as	1
cannot	1
be,	1
nor	1
were	1
it	1
well	1
they	1
should	1
be,	1
told.	1
Suffice	1
it	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
the	1
bridegroom	1
entered	1
the	1
hall	1
in	1
his	1
usual	1
dress,	1
without	1
ornament	1
of	1
any	1
kind;	1
as	1
groomsman	1
he	1
had	1
with	1
him	1
a	1
cousin	1
of	1
Luscinda’s	1
and	1
except	1
the	1
servants	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
one	1
else	1
in	1
the	1
chamber.	1
Soon	1
afterwards	1
Luscinda	1
came	1
out	1
from	1
an	1
antechamber,	1
attended	1
by	1
her	1
mother	1
and	1
two	1
of	1
her	1
damsels,	1
arrayed	1
and	1
adorned	1
as	1
became	1
her	1
rank	1
and	1
beauty,	1
and	1
in	1
full	1
festival	1
and	1
ceremonial	1
attire.	1
My	1
anxiety	1
and	1
distraction	1
did	1
not	1
allow	1
me	1
to	1
observe	1
or	1
notice	1
particularly	1
what	1
she	1
wore;	1
I	1
could	1
only	1
perceive	1
the	1
colours,	1
which	1
were	1
crimson	1
and	1
white,	1
and	1
the	1
glitter	1
of	1
the	1
gems	1
and	1
jewels	1
on	1
her	1
head	1
dress	1
and	1
apparel,	1
surpassed	1
by	1
the	1
rare	1
beauty	1
of	1
her	1
lovely	1
auburn	1
hair	1
that	1
vying	1
with	1
the	1
precious	1
stones	1
and	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
the	1
four	1
torches	1
that	1
stood	1
in	1
the	1
hall	1
shone	1
with	1
a	1
brighter	1
gleam	1
than	1
all.	1
Oh	1
memory,	1
mortal	1
foe	1
of	1
my	1
peace!	1
why	1
bring	1
before	1
me	1
now	1
the	1
incomparable	1
beauty	1
of	1
that	1
adored	1
enemy	1
of	1
mine?	1
Were	1
it	1
not	1
better,	1
cruel	1
memory,	1
to	1
remind	1
me	1
and	1
recall	1
what	1
she	1
then	1
did,	1
that	1
stirred	1
by	1
a	1
wrong	1
so	1
glaring	1
I	1
may	1
seek,	1
if	1
not	1
vengeance	1
now,	1
at	1
least	1
to	1
rid	1
myself	1
of	1
life?	1
Be	1
not	1
weary,	1
sirs,	1
of	1
listening	1
to	1
these	1
digressions;	1
my	1
sorrow	1
is	1
not	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
that	1
can	1
or	1
should	1
be	1
told	1
tersely	1
and	1
briefly,	1
for	1
to	1
me	1
each	1
incident	1
seems	1
to	1
call	1
for	1
many	1
words.”	1
To	1
this	1
the	1
curate	1
replied	1
that	1
not	1
only	1
were	1
they	1
not	1
weary	1
of	1
listening	1
to	1
him,	1
but	1
that	1
the	1
details	1
he	1
mentioned	1
interested	1
them	1
greatly,	1
being	1
of	1
a	1
kind	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
to	1
be	1
omitted	1
and	1
deserving	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
attention	1
as	1
the	1
main	1
story.	1
“To	1
proceed,	1
then,”	1
continued	1
Cardenio:	1
“all	1
being	1
assembled	1
in	1
the	1
hall,	1
the	1
priest	1
of	1
the	1
parish	1
came	1
in	1
and	1
as	1
he	1
took	1
the	1
pair	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
to	1
perform	1
the	1
requisite	1
ceremony,	1
at	1
the	1
words,	1
‘Will	1
you,	1
Señora	1
Luscinda,	1
take	1
Señor	1
Don	1
Fernando,	1
here	1
present,	1
for	1
your	1
lawful	1
husband,	1
as	1
the	1
holy	1
Mother	1
Church	1
ordains?’	1
I	1
thrust	1
my	1
head	1
and	1
neck	1
out	1
from	1
between	1
the	1
tapestries,	1
and	1
with	1
eager	1
ears	1
and	1
throbbing	1
heart	1
set	1
myself	1
to	1
listen	1
to	1
Luscinda’s	1
answer,	1
awaiting	1
in	1
her	1
reply	1
the	1
sentence	1
of	1
death	1
or	1
the	1
grant	1
of	1
life.	1
Oh,	1
that	1
I	1
had	1
but	1
dared	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
to	1
rush	1
forward	1
crying	1
aloud,	1
‘Luscinda,	1
Luscinda!	1
have	1
a	1
care	1
what	1
thou	1
dost;	1
remember	1
what	1
thou	1
owest	1
me;	1
bethink	1
thee	1
thou	1
art	1
mine	1
and	1
canst	1
not	1
be	1
another’s;	1
reflect	1
that	1
thy	1
utterance	1
of	1
“Yes”	1
and	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
my	1
life	1
will	1
come	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
instant.	1
O,	1
treacherous	1
Don	1
Fernando!	1
robber	1
of	1
my	1
glory,	1
death	1
of	1
my	1
life!	1
What	1
seekest	1
thou?	1
Remember	1
that	1
thou	1
canst	1
not	1
as	1
a	1
Christian	1
attain	1
the	1
object	1
of	1
thy	1
wishes,	1
for	1
Luscinda	1
is	1
my	1
bride,	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
her	1
husband!’	1
Fool	1
that	1
I	1
am!	1
now	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
far	1
away,	1
and	1
out	1
of	1
danger,	1
I	1
say	1
I	1
should	1
have	1
done	1
what	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
do:	1
now	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
allowed	1
my	1
precious	1
treasure	1
to	1
be	1
robbed	1
from	1
me,	1
I	1
curse	1
the	1
robber,	1
on	1
whom	1
I	1
might	1
have	1
taken	1
vengeance	1
had	1
I	1
as	1
much	1
heart	1
for	1
it	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
for	1
bewailing	1
my	1
fate;	1
in	1
short,	1
as	1
I	1
was	1
then	1
a	1
coward	1
and	1
a	1
fool,	1
little	1
wonder	1
is	1
it	1
if	1
I	1
am	1
now	1
dying	1
shame-stricken,	1
remorseful,	1
and	1
mad.	1
“The	1
priest	1
stood	1
waiting	1
for	1
the	1
answer	1
of	1
Luscinda,	1
who	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
withheld	1
it;	1
and	1
just	1
as	1
I	1
thought	1
she	1
was	1
taking	1
out	1
the	1
dagger	1
to	1
save	1
her	1
honour,	1
or	1
struggling	1
for	1
words	1
to	1
make	1
some	1
declaration	1
of	1
the	1
truth	1
on	1
my	1
behalf,	1
I	1
heard	1
her	1
say	1
in	1
a	1
faint	1
and	1
feeble	1
voice,	1
‘I	1
will:’	1
Don	1
Fernando	1
said	1
the	1
same,	1
and	1
giving	1
her	1
the	1
ring	1
they	1
stood	1
linked	1
by	1
a	1
knot	1
that	1
could	1
never	1
be	1
loosed.	1
The	1
bridegroom	1
then	1
approached	1
to	1
embrace	1
his	1
bride;	1
and	1
she,	1
pressing	1
her	1
hand	1
upon	1
her	1
heart,	1
fell	1
fainting	1
in	1
her	1
mother’s	1
arms.	1
It	1
only	1
remains	1
now	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
tell	1
you	1
the	1
state	1
I	1
was	1
in	1
when	1
in	1
that	1
consent	1
that	1
I	1
heard	1
I	1
saw	1
all	1
my	1
hopes	1
mocked,	1
the	1
words	1
and	1
promises	1
of	1
Luscinda	1
proved	1
falsehoods,	1
and	1
the	1
recovery	1
of	1
the	1
prize	1
I	1
had	1
that	1
instant	1
lost	1
rendered	1
impossible	1
for	1
ever.	1
I	1
stood	1
stupefied,	1
wholly	1
abandoned,	1
it	1
seemed,	1
by	1
Heaven,	1
declared	1
the	1
enemy	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
that	1
bore	1
me,	1
the	1
air	1
refusing	1
me	1
breath	1
for	1
my	1
sighs,	1
the	1
water	1
moisture	1
for	1
my	1
tears;	1
it	1
was	1
only	1
the	1
fire	1
that	1
gathered	1
strength	1
so	1
that	1
my	1
whole	1
frame	1
glowed	1
with	1
rage	1
and	1
jealousy.	1
They	1
were	1
all	1
thrown	1
into	1
confusion	1
by	1
Luscinda’s	1
fainting,	1
and	1
as	1
her	1
mother	1
was	1
unlacing	1
her	1
to	1
give	1
her	1
air	1
a	1
sealed	1
paper	1
was	1
discovered	1
in	1
her	1
bosom	1
which	1
Don	1
Fernando	1
seized	1
at	1
once	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
read	1
by	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
torches.	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
read	1
it	1
he	1
seated	1
himself	1
in	1
a	1
chair,	1
leaning	1
his	1
cheek	1
on	1
his	1
hand	1
in	1
the	1
attitude	1
of	1
one	1
deep	1
in	1
thought,	1
without	1
taking	1
any	1
part	1
in	1
the	1
efforts	1
that	1
were	1
being	1
made	1
to	1
recover	1
his	1
bride	1
from	1
her	1
fainting	1
fit.	1
“Seeing	1
all	1
the	1
household	1
in	1
confusion,	1
I	1
ventured	1
to	1
come	1
out	1
regardless	1
whether	1
I	1
were	1
seen	1
or	1
not,	1
and	1
determined,	1
if	1
I	1
were,	1
to	1
do	1
some	1
frenzied	1
deed	1
that	1
would	1
prove	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
world	1
the	1
righteous	1
indignation	1
of	1
my	1
breast	1
in	1
the	1
punishment	1
of	1
the	1
treacherous	1
Don	1
Fernando,	1
and	1
even	1
in	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
fickle	1
fainting	1
traitress.	1
But	1
my	1
fate,	1
doubtless	1
reserving	1
me	1
for	1
greater	1
sorrows,	1
if	1
such	1
there	1
be,	1
so	1
ordered	1
it	1
that	1
just	1
then	1
I	1
had	1
enough	1
and	1
to	1
spare	1
of	1
that	1
reason	1
which	1
has	1
since	1
been	1
wanting	1
to	1
me;	1
and	1
so,	1
without	1
seeking	1
to	1
take	1
vengeance	1
on	1
my	1
greatest	1
enemies	1
(which	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
easily	1
taken,	1
as	1
all	1
thought	1
of	1
me	1
was	1
so	1
far	1
from	1
their	1
minds),	1
I	1
resolved	1
to	1
take	1
it	1
upon	1
myself,	1
and	1
on	1
myself	1
to	1
inflict	1
the	1
pain	1
they	1
deserved,	1
perhaps	1
with	1
even	1
greater	1
severity	1
than	1
I	1
should	1
have	1
dealt	1
out	1
to	1
them	1
had	1
I	1
then	1
slain	1
them;	1
for	1
sudden	1
pain	1
is	1
soon	1
over,	1
but	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
protracted	1
by	1
tortures	1
is	1
ever	1
slaying	1
without	1
ending	1
life.	1
In	1
a	1
word,	1
I	1
quitted	1
the	1
house	1
and	1
reached	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
man	1
with	1
whom	1
I	1
had	1
left	1
my	1
mule;	1
I	1
made	1
him	1
saddle	1
it	1
for	1
me,	1
mounted	1
without	1
bidding	1
him	1
farewell,	1
and	1
rode	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
city,	1
like	1
another	1
Lot,	1
not	1
daring	1
to	1
turn	1
my	1
head	1
to	1
look	1
back	1
upon	1
it;	1
and	1
when	1
I	1
found	1
myself	1
alone	1
in	1
the	1
open	1
country,	1
screened	1
by	1
the	1
darkness	1
of	1
the	1
night,	1
and	1
tempted	1
by	1
the	1
stillness	1
to	1
give	1
vent	1
to	1
my	1
grief	1
without	1
apprehension	1
or	1
fear	1
of	1
being	1
heard	1
or	1
seen,	1
then	1
I	1
broke	1
silence	1
and	1
lifted	1
up	1
my	1
voice	1
in	1
maledictions	1
upon	1
Luscinda	1
and	1
Don	1
Fernando,	1
as	1
if	1
I	1
could	1
thus	1
avenge	1
the	1
wrong	1
they	1
had	1
done	1
me.	1
I	1
called	1
her	1
cruel,	1
ungrateful,	1
false,	1
thankless,	1
but	1
above	1
all	1
covetous,	1
since	1
the	1
wealth	1
of	1
my	1
enemy	1
had	1
blinded	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
her	1
affection,	1
and	1
turned	1
it	1
from	1
me	1
to	1
transfer	1
it	1
to	1
one	1
to	1
whom	1
fortune	1
had	1
been	1
more	1
generous	1
and	1
liberal.	1
And	1
yet,	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
this	1
outburst	1
of	1
execration	1
and	1
upbraiding,	1
I	1
found	1
excuses	1
for	1
her,	1
saying	1
it	1
was	1
no	1
wonder	1
that	1
a	1
young	1
girl	1
in	1
the	1
seclusion	1
of	1
her	1
parents’	1
house,	1
trained	1
and	1
schooled	1
to	1
obey	1
them	1
always,	1
should	1
have	1
been	1
ready	1
to	1
yield	1
to	1
their	1
wishes	1
when	1
they	1
offered	1
her	1
for	1
a	1
husband	1
a	1
gentleman	1
of	1
such	1
distinction,	1
wealth,	1
and	1
noble	1
birth,	1
that	1
if	1
she	1
had	1
refused	1
to	1
accept	1
him	1
she	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
thought	1
out	1
of	1
her	1
senses,	1
or	1
to	1
have	1
set	1
her	1
affection	1
elsewhere,	1
a	1
suspicion	1
injurious	1
to	1
her	1
fair	1
name	1
and	1
fame.	1
But	1
then	1
again,	1
I	1
said,	1
had	1
she	1
declared	1
I	1
was	1
her	1
husband,	1
they	1
would	1
have	1
seen	1
that	1
in	1
choosing	1
me	1
she	1
had	1
not	1
chosen	1
so	1
ill	1
but	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
excuse	1
her,	1
for	1
before	1
Don	1
Fernando	1
had	1
made	1
his	1
offer,	1
they	1
themselves	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
desired,	1
if	1
their	1
desires	1
had	1
been	1
ruled	1
by	1
reason,	1
a	1
more	1
eligible	1
husband	1
for	1
their	1
daughter	1
than	1
I	1
was;	1
and	1
she,	1
before	1
taking	1
the	1
last	1
fatal	1
step	1
of	1
giving	1
her	1
hand,	1
might	1
easily	1
have	1
said	1
that	1
I	1
had	1
already	1
given	1
her	1
mine,	1
for	1
I	1
should	1
have	1
come	1
forward	1
to	1
support	1
any	1
assertion	1
of	1
hers	1
to	1
that	1
effect.	1
In	1
short,	1
I	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
conclusion	1
that	1
feeble	1
love,	1
little	1
reflection,	1
great	1
ambition,	1
and	1
a	1
craving	1
for	1
rank,	1
had	1
made	1
her	1
forget	1
the	1
words	1
with	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
deceived	1
me,	1
encouraged	1
and	1
supported	1
by	1
my	1
firm	1
hopes	1
and	1
honourable	1
passion.	1
“Thus	1
soliloquising	1
and	1
agitated,	1
I	1
journeyed	1
onward	1
for	1
the	1
remainder	1
of	1
the	1
night,	1
and	1
by	1
daybreak	1
I	1
reached	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
passes	1
of	1
these	1
mountains,	1
among	1
which	1
I	1
wandered	1
for	1
three	1
days	1
more	1
without	1
taking	1
any	1
path	1
or	1
road,	1
until	1
I	1
came	1
to	1
some	1
meadows	1
lying	1
on	1
I	1
know	1
not	1
which	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
mountains,	1
and	1
there	1
I	1
inquired	1
of	1
some	1
herdsmen	1
in	1
what	1
direction	1
the	1
most	1
rugged	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
range	1
lay.	1
They	1
told	1
me	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
in	1
this	1
quarter,	1
and	1
I	1
at	1
once	1
directed	1
my	1
course	1
hither,	1
intending	1
to	1
end	1
my	1
life	1
here;	1
but	1
as	1
I	1
was	1
making	1
my	1
way	1
among	1
these	1
crags,	1
my	1
mule	1
dropped	1
dead	1
through	1
fatigue	1
and	1
hunger,	1
or,	1
as	1
I	1
think	1
more	1
likely,	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
have	1
done	1
with	1
such	1
a	1
worthless	1
burden	1
as	1
it	1
bore	1
in	1
me.	1
I	1
was	1
left	1
on	1
foot,	1
worn	1
out,	1
famishing,	1
without	1
anyone	1
to	1
help	1
me	1
or	1
any	1
thought	1
of	1
seeking	1
help:	1
and	1
so	1
thus	1
I	1
lay	1
stretched	1
on	1
the	1
ground,	1
how	1
long	1
I	1
know	1
not,	1
after	1
which	1
I	1
rose	1
up	1
free	1
from	1
hunger,	1
and	1
found	1
beside	1
me	1
some	1
goatherds,	1
who	1
no	1
doubt	1
were	1
the	1
persons	1
who	1
had	1
relieved	1
me	1
in	1
my	1
need,	1
for	1
they	1
told	1
me	1
how	1
they	1
had	1
found	1
me,	1
and	1
how	1
I	1
had	1
been	1
uttering	1
ravings	1
that	1
showed	1
plainly	1
I	1
had	1
lost	1
my	1
reason;	1
and	1
since	1
then	1
I	1
am	1
conscious	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
always	1
in	1
full	1
possession	1
of	1
it,	1
but	1
at	1
times	1
so	1
deranged	1
and	1
crazed	1
that	1
I	1
do	1
a	1
thousand	1
mad	1
things,	1
tearing	1
my	1
clothes,	1
crying	1
aloud	1
in	1
these	1
solitudes,	1
cursing	1
my	1
fate,	1
and	1
idly	1
calling	1
on	1
the	1
dear	1
name	1
of	1
her	1
who	1
is	1
my	1
enemy,	1
and	1
only	1
seeking	1
to	1
end	1
my	1
life	1
in	1
lamentation;	1
and	1
when	1
I	1
recover	1
my	1
senses	1
I	1
find	1
myself	1
so	1
exhausted	1
and	1
weary	1
that	1
I	1
can	1
scarcely	1
move.	1
Most	1
commonly	1
my	1
dwelling	1
is	1
the	1
hollow	1
of	1
a	1
cork	1
tree	1
large	1
enough	1
to	1
shelter	1
this	1
miserable	1
body;	1
the	1
herdsmen	1
and	1
goatherds	1
who	1
frequent	1
these	1
mountains,	1
moved	1
by	1
compassion,	1
furnish	1
me	1
with	1
food,	1
leaving	1
it	1
by	1
the	1
wayside	1
or	1
on	1
the	1
rocks,	1
where	1
they	1
think	1
I	1
may	1
perhaps	1
pass	1
and	1
find	1
it;	1
and	1
so,	1
even	1
though	1
I	1
may	1
be	1
then	1
out	1
of	1
my	1
senses,	1
the	1
wants	1
of	1
nature	1
teach	1
me	1
what	1
is	1
required	1
to	1
sustain	1
me,	1
and	1
make	1
me	1
crave	1
it	1
and	1
eager	1
to	1
take	1
it.	1
At	1
other	1
times,	1
so	1
they	1
tell	1
me	1
when	1
they	1
find	1
me	1
in	1
a	1
rational	1
mood,	1
I	1
sally	1
out	1
upon	1
the	1
road,	1
and	1
though	1
they	1
would	1
gladly	1
give	1
it	1
me,	1
I	1
snatch	1
food	1
by	1
force	1
from	1
the	1
shepherds	1
bringing	1
it	1
from	1
the	1
village	1
to	1
their	1
huts.	1
Thus	1
do	1
pass	1
the	1
wretched	1
life	1
that	1
remains	1
to	1
me,	1
until	1
it	1
be	1
Heaven’s	1
will	1
to	1
bring	1
it	1
to	1
a	1
close,	1
or	1
so	1
to	1
order	1
my	1
memory	1
that	1
I	1
no	1
longer	1
recollect	1
the	1
beauty	1
and	1
treachery	1
of	1
Luscinda,	1
or	1
the	1
wrong	1
done	1
me	1
by	1
Don	1
Fernando;	1
for	1
if	1
it	1
will	1
do	1
this	1
without	1
depriving	1
me	1
of	1
life,	1
I	1
will	1
turn	1
my	1
thoughts	1
into	1
some	1
better	1
channel;	1
if	1
not,	1
I	1
can	1
only	1
implore	1
it	1
to	1
have	1
full	1
mercy	1
on	1
my	1
soul,	1
for	1
in	1
myself	1
I	1
feel	1
no	1
power	1
or	1
strength	1
to	1
release	1
my	1
body	1
from	1
this	1
strait	1
in	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
of	1
my	1
own	1
accord	1
chosen	1
to	1
place	1
it.	1
“Such,	1
sirs,	1
is	1
the	1
dismal	1
story	1
of	1
my	1
misfortune:	1
say	1
if	1
it	1
be	1
one	1
that	1
can	1
be	1
told	1
with	1
less	1
emotion	1
than	1
you	1
have	1
seen	1
in	1
me;	1
and	1
do	1
not	1
trouble	1
yourselves	1
with	1
urging	1
or	1
pressing	1
upon	1
me	1
what	1
reason	1
suggests	1
as	1
likely	1
to	1
serve	1
for	1
my	1
relief,	1
for	1
it	1
will	1
avail	1
me	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
the	1
medicine	1
prescribed	1
by	1
a	1
wise	1
physician	1
avails	1
the	1
sick	1
man	1
who	1
will	1
not	1
take	1
it.	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
wish	1
for	1
health	1
without	1
Luscinda;	1
and	1
since	1
it	1
is	1
her	1
pleasure	1
to	1
be	1
another’s,	1
when	1
she	1
is	1
or	1
should	1
be	1
mine,	1
let	1
it	1
be	1
mine	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
prey	1
to	1
misery	1
when	1
I	1
might	1
have	1
enjoyed	1
happiness.	1
She	1
by	1
her	1
fickleness	1
strove	1
to	1
make	1
my	1
ruin	1
irretrievable;	1
I	1
will	1
strive	1
to	1
gratify	1
her	1
wishes	1
by	1
seeking	1
destruction;	1
and	1
it	1
will	1
show	1
generations	1
to	1
come	1
that	1
I	1
alone	1
was	1
deprived	1
of	1
that	1
of	1
which	1
all	1
others	1
in	1
misfortune	1
have	1
a	1
superabundance,	1
for	1
to	1
them	1
the	1
impossibility	1
of	1
being	1
consoled	1
is	1
itself	1
a	1
consolation,	1
while	1
to	1
me	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
greater	1
sorrows	1
and	1
sufferings,	1
for	1
I	1
think	1
that	1
even	1
in	1
death	1
there	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
an	1
end	1
of	1
them.”	1
Here	1
Cardenio	1
brought	1
to	1
a	1
close	1
his	1
long	1
discourse	1
and	1
story,	1
as	1
full	1
of	1
misfortune	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
of	1
love;	1
but	1
just	1
as	1
the	1
curate	1
was	1
going	1
to	1
address	1
some	1
words	1
of	1
comfort	1
to	1
him,	1
he	1
was	1
stopped	1
by	1
a	1
voice	1
that	1
reached	1
his	1
ear,	1
saying	1
in	1
melancholy	1
tones	1
what	1
will	1
be	1
told	1
in	1
the	1
Fourth	1
Part	1
of	1
this	1
narrative;	1
for	1
at	1
this	1
point	1
the	1
sage	1
and	1
sagacious	1
historian,	1
Cid	1
Hamete	1
Benengeli,	1
brought	1
the	1
Third	1
to	1
a	1
conclusion.	1

Happy	1
and	1
fortunate	1
were	1
the	1
times	1
when	1
that	1
most	1
daring	1
knight	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
of	1
La	1
Mancha	1
was	1
sent	1
into	1
the	1
world;	1
for	1
by	1
reason	1
of	1
his	1
having	1
formed	1
a	1
resolution	1
so	1
honourable	1
as	1
that	1
of	1
seeking	1
to	1
revive	1
and	1
restore	1
to	1
the	1
world	1
the	1
long-lost	1

almost	1
defunct	1
order	1
of	1
knight-errantry,	1
we	1

enjoy	1
in	1

of	1
ours,	1
so	1
poor	1
in	1
light	1
entertainment,	1
not	1
only	1
the	1

of	1
his	1
veracious	1

also	1
of	1

which	1
are,	1
in	1
a	1
measure,	1
no	1
less	1
pleasing,	1
ingenious,	1
and	1
truthful,	1
than	1
the	1
history	1
itself;	1
which,	1
resuming	1
its	1
thread,	1
carded,	1
spun,	1
and	1
wound,	1
relates	1
that	1
just	1
as	1
the	1
curate	1
was	1
going	1
to	1
offer	1
consolation	1
to	1
Cardenio,	1
he	1
was	1
interrupted	1
by	1
a	1
voice	1
that	1
fell	1
upon	1
his	1
ear	1
saying	1
in	1
plaintive	1
tones:	1
“O	1
God!	1
is	1
it	1
possible	1
I	1
have	1
found	1
a	1
place	1
that	1
may	1
serve	1
as	1
a	1
secret	1
grave	1
for	1
the	1
weary	1
load	1
of	1
this	1
body	1
that	1
I	1
support	1
so	1
unwillingly?	1
If	1
the	1
solitude	1
these	1
mountains	1
promise	1
deceives	1
me	1
not,	1
it	1
is	1
so;	1
ah!	1
woe	1
is	1
me!	1
how	1
much	1
more	1
grateful	1
to	1
my	1
mind	1
will	1
be	1
the	1
society	1
of	1
these	1
rocks	1
and	1
brakes	1
that	1
permit	1
me	1
to	1
complain	1
of	1
my	1
misfortune	1
to	1
Heaven,	1
than	1
that	1
of	1
any	1
human	1
being,	1
for	1
there	1
is	1
none	1
on	1
earth	1
to	1
look	1
to	1
for	1
counsel	1
in	1
doubt,	1
comfort	1
in	1
sorrow,	1
or	1
relief	1
in	1
distress!”	1
All	1
this	1
was	1
heard	1
distinctly	1
by	1
the	1
curate	1
and	1
those	1
with	1
him,	1
and	1
as	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
them	1
to	1
be	1
uttered	1
close	1
by,	1
as	1
indeed	1
it	1
was,	1
they	1
got	1
up	1
to	1
look	1
for	1
the	1
speaker,	1
and	1
before	1
they	1
had	1
gone	1
twenty	1
paces	1
they	1
discovered	1
behind	1
a	1
rock,	1
seated	1
at	1
the	1
foot	1
of	1
an	1
ash	1
tree,	1
a	1
youth	1
in	1
the	1
dress	1
of	1
a	1
peasant,	1
whose	1
face	1
they	1
were	1
unable	1
at	1
the	1
moment	1
to	1
see	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
leaning	1
forward,	1
bathing	1
his	1
feet	1
in	1
the	1
brook	1
that	1
flowed	1
past.	1
They	1
approached	1
so	1
silently	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
perceive	1
them,	1
being	1
fully	1
occupied	1
in	1
bathing	1
his	1
feet,	1
which	1
were	1
so	1
fair	1
that	1
they	1
looked	1
like	1
two	1
pieces	1
of	1
shining	1
crystal	1
brought	1
forth	1
among	1
the	1
other	1
stones	1
of	1
the	1
brook.	1
The	1
whiteness	1
and	1
beauty	1
of	1
these	1
feet	1
struck	1
them	1
with	1
surprise,	1
for	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
seem	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
made	1
to	1
crush	1
clods	1
or	1
to	1
follow	1
the	1
plough	1
and	1
the	1
oxen	1
as	1
their	1
owner’s	1
dress	1
suggested;	1
and	1
so,	1
finding	1
they	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
noticed,	1
the	1
curate,	1
who	1
was	1
in	1
front,	1
made	1
a	1
sign	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
two	1
to	1
conceal	1
themselves	1
behind	1
some	1
fragments	1
of	1
rock	1
that	1
lay	1
there;	1
which	1
they	1
did,	1
observing	1
closely	1
what	1
the	1
youth	1
was	1
about.	1
He	1
had	1
on	1
a	1
loose	1
double-skirted	1
dark	1
brown	1
jacket	1
bound	1
tight	1
to	1
his	1
body	1
with	1
a	1
white	1
cloth;	1
he	1
wore	1
besides	1
breeches	1
and	1
gaiters	1
of	1
brown	1
cloth,	1
and	1
on	1
his	1
head	1
a	1
brown	1
montera;	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
the	1
gaiters	1
turned	1
up	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
leg,	1
which	1
verily	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
of	1
pure	1
alabaster.	1

As	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
bathing	1
his	1
beautiful	1
feet,	1
he	1
wiped	1
them	1
with	1
a	1
towel	1
he	1
took	1
from	1
under	1
the	1
montera,	1
on	1
taking	1
off	1
which	1
he	1
raised	1
his	1
face,	1
and	1
those	1
who	1
were	1
watching	1
him	1
had	1
an	1
opportunity	1
of	1
seeing	1
a	1
beauty	1
so	1
exquisite	1
that	1
Cardenio	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
curate	1
in	1
a	1
whisper:	1
“As	1
this	1
is	1
not	1
Luscinda,	1
it	1
is	1
no	1
human	1
creature	1
but	1
a	1
divine	1
being.”	1
The	1
youth	1
then	1
took	1
off	1
the	1
montera,	1
and	1
shaking	1
his	1
head	1
from	1
side	1
to	1
side	1
there	1
broke	1
loose	1
and	1
spread	1
out	1
a	1
mass	1
of	1
hair	1
that	1
the	1
beams	1
of	1
the	1
sun	1
might	1
have	1
envied;	1
by	1
this	1
they	1
knew	1
that	1
what	1
had	1
seemed	1
a	1
peasant	1
was	1
a	1
lovely	1
woman,	1
nay	1
the	1
most	1
beautiful	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
two	1
of	1
them	1
had	1
ever	1
beheld,	1
or	1
even	1
Cardenio’s	1
if	1
they	1
had	1
not	1
seen	1
and	1
known	1
Luscinda,	1
for	1
he	1
afterwards	1
declared	1
that	1
only	1
the	1
beauty	1
of	1
Luscinda	1
could	1
compare	1
with	1
this.	1
The	1
long	1
auburn	1
tresses	1
not	1
only	1
covered	1
her	1
shoulders,	1
but	1
such	1
was	1
their	1
length	1
and	1
abundance,	1
concealed	1
her	1
all	1
round	1
beneath	1
their	1
masses,	1
so	1
that	1
except	1
the	1
feet	1
nothing	1
of	1
her	1
form	1
was	1
visible.	1
She	1
now	1
used	1
her	1
hands	1
as	1
a	1
comb,	1
and	1
if	1
her	1
feet	1
had	1
seemed	1
like	1
bits	1
of	1
crystal	1
in	1
the	1
water,	1
her	1
hands	1
looked	1
like	1
pieces	1
of	1
driven	1
snow	1
among	1
her	1
locks;	1
all	1
which	1
increased	1
not	1
only	1
the	1
admiration	1
of	1
the	1
three	1
beholders,	1
but	1
their	1
anxiety	1
to	1
learn	1
who	1
she	1
was.	1
With	1
this	1
object	1
they	1
resolved	1
to	1
show	1
themselves,	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
stir	1
they	1
made	1
in	1
getting	1
upon	1
their	1
feet	1
the	1
fair	1
damsel	1
raised	1
her	1
head,	1
and	1
parting	1
her	1
hair	1
from	1
before	1
her	1
eyes	1
with	1
both	1
hands,	1
she	1
looked	1
to	1
see	1
who	1
had	1
made	1
the	1
noise,	1
and	1
the	1
instant	1
she	1
perceived	1
them	1
she	1
started	1
to	1
her	1
feet,	1
and	1
without	1
waiting	1
to	1
put	1
on	1
her	1
shoes	1
or	1
gather	1
up	1
her	1
hair,	1
hastily	1
snatched	1
up	1
a	1
bundle	1
as	1
though	1
of	1
clothes	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
beside	1
her,	1
and,	1
scared	1
and	1
alarmed,	1
endeavoured	1
to	1
take	1
flight;	1
but	1
before	1
she	1
had	1
gone	1
six	1
paces	1
she	1
fell	1
to	1
the	1
ground,	1
her	1
delicate	1
feet	1
being	1
unable	1
to	1
bear	1
the	1
roughness	1
of	1
the	1
stones;	1
seeing	1
which,	1
the	1
three	1
hastened	1
towards	1
her,	1
and	1
the	1
curate	1
addressing	1
her	1
first	1
said:	1
“Stay,	1
señora,	1
whoever	1
you	1
may	1
be,	1
for	1
those	1
whom	1
you	1
see	1
here	1
only	1
desire	1
to	1
be	1
of	1
service	1
to	1
you;	1
you	1
have	1
no	1
need	1
to	1
attempt	1
a	1
flight	1
so	1
heedless,	1
for	1
neither	1
can	1
your	1
feet	1
bear	1
it,	1
nor	1
we	1
allow	1
it.”	1
Taken	1
by	1
surprise	1
and	1
bewildered,	1
she	1
made	1
no	1
reply	1
to	1
these	1
words.	1
They,	1
however,	1
came	1
towards	1
her,	1
and	1
the	1
curate	1
taking	1
her	1
hand	1
went	1
on	1
to	1
say:	1
“What	1
your	1
dress	1
would	1
hide,	1
señora,	1
is	1
made	1
known	1
to	1
us	1
by	1
your	1
hair;	1
a	1
clear	1
proof	1
that	1
it	1
can	1
be	1
no	1
trifling	1
cause	1
that	1
has	1
disguised	1
your	1
beauty	1
in	1
a	1
garb	1
so	1
unworthy	1
of	1
it,	1
and	1
sent	1
it	1
into	1
solitudes	1
like	1
these	1
where	1
we	1
have	1
had	1
the	1
good	1
fortune	1
to	1
find	1
you,	1
if	1
not	1
to	1
relieve	1
your	1
distress,	1
at	1
least	1
to	1
offer	1
you	1
comfort;	1
for	1
no	1
distress,	1
so	1
long	1
as	1
life	1
lasts,	1
can	1
be	1
so	1
oppressive	1
or	1
reach	1
such	1
a	1
height	1
as	1
to	1
make	1
the	1
sufferer	1
refuse	1
to	1
listen	1
to	1
comfort	1
offered	1
with	1
good	1
intention.	1
And	1
so,	1
señora,	1
or	1
señor,	1
or	1
whatever	1
you	1
prefer	1
to	1
be,	1
dismiss	1
the	1
fears	1
that	1
our	1
appearance	1
has	1
caused	1
you	1
and	1
make	1
us	1
acquainted	1
with	1
your	1
good	1
or	1
evil	1
fortunes,	1
for	1
from	1
all	1
of	1
us	1
together,	1
or	1
from	1
each	1
one	1
of	1
us,	1
you	1
will	1
receive	1
sympathy	1
in	1
your	1
trouble.”	1
While	1
the	1
curate	1
was	1
speaking,	1
the	1
disguised	1
damsel	1
stood	1
as	1
if	1
spell-bound,	1
looking	1
at	1
them	1
without	1
opening	1
her	1
lips	1
or	1
uttering	1
a	1
word,	1
just	1
like	1
a	1
village	1
rustic	1
to	1
whom	1
something	1
strange	1
that	1
he	1
has	1
never	1
seen	1
before	1
has	1
been	1
suddenly	1
shown;	1
but	1
on	1
the	1
curate	1
addressing	1
some	1
further	1
words	1
to	1
the	1
same	1
effect	1
to	1
her,	1
sighing	1
deeply	1
she	1
broke	1
silence	1
and	1
said:	1
“Since	1
the	1
solitude	1
of	1
these	1
mountains	1
has	1
been	1
unable	1
to	1
conceal	1
me,	1
and	1
the	1
escape	1
of	1
my	1
dishevelled	1
tresses	1
will	1
not	1
allow	1
my	1
tongue	1
to	1
deal	1
in	1
falsehoods,	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
idle	1
for	1
me	1
now	1
to	1
make	1
any	1
further	1
pretence	1
of	1
what,	1
if	1
you	1
were	1
to	1
believe	1
me,	1
you	1
would	1
believe	1
more	1
out	1
of	1
courtesy	1
than	1
for	1
any	1
other	1
reason.	1
This	1
being	1
so,	1
I	1
say	1
I	1
thank	1
you,	1
sirs,	1
for	1
the	1
offer	1
you	1
have	1
made	1
me,	1
which	1
places	1
me	1
under	1
the	1
obligation	1
of	1
complying	1
with	1
the	1
request	1
you	1
have	1
made	1
of	1
me;	1
though	1
I	1
fear	1
the	1
account	1
I	1
shall	1
give	1
you	1
of	1
my	1
misfortunes	1
will	1
excite	1
in	1
you	1
as	1
much	1
concern	1
as	1
compassion,	1
for	1
you	1
will	1
be	1
unable	1
to	1
suggest	1
anything	1
to	1
remedy	1
them	1
or	1
any	1
consolation	1
to	1
alleviate	1
them.	1
However,	1
that	1
my	1
honour	1
may	1
not	1
be	1
left	1
a	1
matter	1
of	1
doubt	1
in	1
your	1
minds,	1
now	1
that	1
you	1
have	1
discovered	1
me	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
woman,	1
and	1
see	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
young,	1
alone,	1
and	1
in	1
this	1
dress,	1
things	1
that	1
taken	1
together	1
or	1
separately	1
would	1
be	1
enough	1
to	1
destroy	1
any	1
good	1
name,	1
I	1
feel	1
bound	1
to	1
tell	1
what	1
I	1
would	1
willingly	1
keep	1
secret	1
if	1
I	1
could.”	1
All	1
this	1
she	1
who	1
was	1
now	1
seen	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
lovely	1
woman	1
delivered	1
without	1
any	1
hesitation,	1
with	1
so	1
much	1
ease	1
and	1
in	1
so	1
sweet	1
a	1
voice	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
not	1
less	1
charmed	1
by	1
her	1
intelligence	1
than	1
by	1
her	1
beauty,	1
and	1
as	1
they	1
again	1
repeated	1
their	1
offers	1
and	1
entreaties	1
to	1
her	1
to	1
fulfil	1
her	1
promise,	1
she	1
without	1
further	1
pressing,	1
first	1
modestly	1
covering	1
her	1
feet	1
and	1
gathering	1
up	1
her	1
hair,	1
seated	1
herself	1
on	1
a	1
stone	1
with	1
the	1
three	1
placed	1
around	1
her,	1
and,	1
after	1
an	1
effort	1
to	1
restrain	1
some	1
tears	1
that	1
came	1
to	1
her	1
eyes,	1
in	1
a	1
clear	1
and	1
steady	1
voice	1
began	1
her	1
story	1
thus:	1
“In	1
this	1
Andalusia	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
town	1
from	1
which	1
a	1
duke	1
takes	1
a	1
title	1
which	1
makes	1
him	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
that	1
are	1
called	1
Grandees	1
of	1
Spain.	1
This	1
nobleman	1
has	1
two	1
sons,	1
the	1
elder	1
heir	1
to	1
his	1
dignity	1
and	1
apparently	1
to	1
his	1
good	1
qualities;	1
the	1
younger	1
heir	1
to	1
I	1
know	1
not	1
what,	1
unless	1
it	1
be	1
the	1
treachery	1
of	1
Vellido	1
and	1
the	1
falsehood	1
of	1
Ganelon.	1
My	1
parents	1
are	1
this	1
lord’s	1
vassals,	1
lowly	1
in	1
origin,	1
but	1
so	1
wealthy	1
that	1
if	1
birth	1
had	1
conferred	1
as	1
much	1
on	1
them	1
as	1
fortune,	1
they	1
would	1
have	1
had	1
nothing	1
left	1
to	1
desire,	1
nor	1
should	1
I	1
have	1
had	1
reason	1
to	1
fear	1
trouble	1
like	1
that	1
in	1
which	1
I	1
find	1
myself	1
now;	1
for	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
that	1
my	1
ill	1
fortune	1
came	1
of	1
theirs	1
in	1
not	1
having	1
been	1
nobly	1
born.	1
It	1
is	1
true	1
they	1
are	1
not	1
so	1
low	1
that	1
they	1
have	1
any	1
reason	1
to	1
be	1
ashamed	1
of	1
their	1
condition,	1
but	1
neither	1
are	1
they	1
so	1
high	1
as	1
to	1
remove	1
from	1
my	1
mind	1
the	1
impression	1
that	1
my	1
mishap	1
comes	1
of	1
their	1
humble	1
birth.	1
They	1
are,	1
in	1
short,	1
peasants,	1
plain	1
homely	1
people,	1
without	1
any	1
taint	1
of	1
disreputable	1
blood,	1
and,	1
as	1
the	1
saying	1
is,	1
old	1
rusty	1
Christians,	1
but	1
so	1
rich	1
that	1
by	1
their	1
wealth	1
and	1
free-handed	1
way	1
of	1
life	1
they	1
are	1
coming	1
by	1
degrees	1
to	1
be	1
considered	1
gentlefolk	1
by	1
birth,	1
and	1
even	1
by	1
position;	1
though	1
the	1
wealth	1
and	1
nobility	1
they	1
thought	1
most	1
of	1
was	1
having	1
me	1
for	1
their	1
daughter;	1
and	1
as	1
they	1
have	1
no	1
other	1
child	1
to	1
make	1
their	1
heir,	1
and	1
are	1
affectionate	1
parents,	1
I	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
indulged	1
daughters	1
that	1
ever	1
parents	1
indulged.	1
“I	1
was	1
the	1
mirror	1
in	1
which	1
they	1
beheld	1
themselves,	1
the	1
staff	1
of	1
their	1
old	1
age,	1
and	1
the	1
object	1
in	1
which,	1
with	1
submission	1
to	1
Heaven,	1
all	1
their	1
wishes	1
centred,	1
and	1
mine	1
were	1
in	1
accordance	1
with	1
theirs,	1
for	1
I	1
knew	1
their	1
worth;	1
and	1
as	1
I	1
was	1
mistress	1
of	1
their	1
hearts,	1
so	1
was	1
I	1
also	1
of	1
their	1
possessions.	1
Through	1
me	1
they	1
engaged	1
or	1
dismissed	1
their	1
servants;	1
through	1
my	1
hands	1
passed	1
the	1
accounts	1
and	1
returns	1
of	1
what	1
was	1
sown	1
and	1
reaped;	1
the	1
oil-mills,	1
the	1
wine-presses,	1
the	1
count	1
of	1
the	1
flocks	1
and	1
herds,	1
the	1
beehives,	1
all	1
in	1
short	1
that	1
a	1
rich	1
farmer	1
like	1
my	1
father	1
has	1
or	1
can	1
have,	1
I	1
had	1
under	1
my	1
care,	1
and	1
I	1
acted	1
as	1
steward	1
and	1
mistress	1
with	1
an	1
assiduity	1
on	1
my	1
part	1
and	1
satisfaction	1
on	1
theirs	1
that	1
I	1
cannot	1
well	1
describe	1
to	1
you.	1
The	1
leisure	1
hours	1
left	1
to	1
me	1
after	1
I	1
had	1
given	1
the	1
requisite	1
orders	1
to	1
the	1
head-shepherds,	1
overseers,	1
and	1
other	1
labourers,	1
I	1
passed	1
in	1
such	1
employments	1
as	1
are	1
not	1
only	1
allowable	1
but	1
necessary	1
for	1
young	1
girls,	1
those	1
that	1
the	1
needle,	1
embroidery	1
cushion,	1
and	1
spinning	1
wheel	1
usually	1
afford,	1
and	1
if	1
to	1
refresh	1
my	1
mind	1
I	1
quitted	1
them	1
for	1
a	1
while,	1
I	1
found	1
recreation	1
in	1
reading	1
some	1
devotional	1
book	1
or	1
playing	1
the	1
harp,	1
for	1
experience	1
taught	1
me	1
that	1
music	1
soothes	1
the	1
troubled	1
mind	1
and	1
relieves	1
weariness	1
of	1
spirit.	1
Such	1
was	1
the	1
life	1
I	1
led	1
in	1
my	1
parents’	1
house	1
and	1
if	1
I	1
have	1
depicted	1
it	1
thus	1
minutely,	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
out	1
of	1
ostentation,	1
or	1
to	1
let	1
you	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
rich,	1
but	1
that	1
you	1
may	1
see	1
how,	1
without	1
any	1
fault	1
of	1
mine,	1
I	1
have	1
fallen	1
from	1
the	1
happy	1
condition	1
I	1
have	1
described,	1
to	1
the	1
misery	1
I	1
am	1
in	1
at	1
present.	1
The	1
truth	1
is,	1
that	1
while	1
I	1
was	1
leading	1
this	1
busy	1
life,	1
in	1
a	1
retirement	1
that	1
might	1
compare	1
with	1
that	1
of	1
a	1
monastery,	1
and	1
unseen	1
as	1
I	1
thought	1
by	1
any	1
except	1
the	1
servants	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
(for	1
when	1
I	1
went	1
to	1
Mass	1
it	1
was	1
so	1
early	1
in	1
the	1
morning,	1
and	1
I	1
was	1
so	1
closely	1
attended	1
by	1
my	1
mother	1
and	1
the	1
women	1
of	1
the	1
household,	1
and	1
so	1
thickly	1
veiled	1
and	1
so	1
shy,	1
that	1
my	1
eyes	1
scarcely	1
saw	1
more	1
ground	1
than	1
I	1
trod	1
on),	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
all	1
this,	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
love,	1
or	1
idleness,	1
more	1
properly	1
speaking,	1
that	1
the	1
lynx’s	1
cannot	1
rival,	1
discovered	1
me,	1
with	1
the	1
help	1
of	1
the	1
assiduity	1
of	1
Don	1
Fernando;	1
for	1
that	1
is	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
younger	1
son	1
of	1
the	1
duke	1
I	1
told	1
of.”	1
The	1
moment	1
the	1
speaker	1
mentioned	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Don	1
Fernando,	1
Cardenio	1
changed	1
colour	1
and	1
broke	1
into	1
a	1
sweat,	1
with	1
such	1
signs	1
of	1
emotion	1
that	1
the	1
curate	1
and	1
the	1
barber,	1
who	1
observed	1
it,	1
feared	1
that	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
mad	1
fits	1
which	1
they	1
heard	1
attacked	1
him	1
sometimes	1
was	1
coming	1
upon	1
him;	1
but	1
Cardenio	1
showed	1
no	1
further	1
agitation	1
and	1
remained	1
quiet,	1
regarding	1
the	1
peasant	1
girl	1
with	1
fixed	1
attention,	1
for	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
suspect	1
who	1
she	1
was.	1
She,	1
however,	1
without	1
noticing	1
the	1
excitement	1
of	1
Cardenio,	1
continuing	1
her	1
story,	1
went	1
on	1
to	1
say:	1
“And	1
they	1
had	1
hardly	1
discovered	1
me,	1
when,	1
as	1
he	1
owned	1
afterwards,	1
he	1
was	1
smitten	1
with	1
a	1
violent	1
love	1
for	1
me,	1
as	1
the	1
manner	1
in	1
which	1
it	1
displayed	1
itself	1
plainly	1
showed.	1
But	1
to	1
shorten	1
the	1
long	1
recital	1
of	1
my	1
woes,	1
I	1
will	1
pass	1
over	1
in	1
silence	1
all	1
the	1
artifices	1
employed	1
by	1
Don	1
Fernando	1
for	1
declaring	1
his	1
passion	1
for	1
me.	1
He	1
bribed	1
all	1
the	1
household,	1
he	1
gave	1
and	1
offered	1
gifts	1
and	1
presents	1
to	1
my	1
parents;	1
every	1
day	1
was	1
like	1
a	1
holiday	1
or	1
a	1
merry-making	1
in	1
our	1
street;	1
by	1
night	1
no	1
one	1
could	1
sleep	1
for	1
the	1
music;	1
the	1
love	1
letters	1
that	1
used	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
my	1
hand,	1
no	1
one	1
knew	1
how,	1
were	1
innumerable,	1
full	1
of	1
tender	1
pleadings	1
and	1
pledges,	1
containing	1
more	1
promises	1
and	1
oaths	1
than	1
there	1
were	1
letters	1
in	1
them;	1
all	1
which	1
not	1
only	1
did	1
not	1
soften	1
me,	1
but	1
hardened	1
my	1
heart	1
against	1
him,	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
my	1
mortal	1
enemy,	1
and	1
as	1
if	1
everything	1
he	1
did	1
to	1
make	1
me	1
yield	1
were	1
done	1
with	1
the	1
opposite	1
intention.	1
Not	1
that	1
the	1
high-bred	1
bearing	1
of	1
Don	1
Fernando	1
was	1
disagreeable	1
to	1
me,	1
or	1
that	1
I	1
found	1
his	1
importunities	1
wearisome;	1
for	1
it	1
gave	1
me	1
a	1
certain	1
sort	1
of	1
satisfaction	1
to	1
find	1
myself	1
so	1
sought	1
and	1
prized	1
by	1
a	1
gentleman	1
of	1
such	1
distinction,	1
and	1
I	1
was	1
not	1
displeased	1
at	1
seeing	1
my	1
praises	1
in	1
his	1
letters	1
(for	1
however	1
ugly	1
we	1
women	1
may	1
be,	1
it	1
seems	1
to	1
me	1
it	1
always	1
pleases	1
us	1
to	1
hear	1
ourselves	1
called	1
beautiful)	1
but	1
that	1
my	1
own	1
sense	1
of	1
right	1
was	1
opposed	1
to	1
all	1
this,	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
the	1
repeated	1
advice	1
of	1
my	1
parents,	1
who	1
now	1
very	1
plainly	1
perceived	1
Don	1
Fernando’s	1
purpose,	1
for	1
he	1
cared	1
very	1
little	1
if	1
all	1
the	1
world	1
knew	1
it.	1
They	1
told	1
me	1
they	1
trusted	1
and	1
confided	1
their	1
honour	1
and	1
good	1
name	1
to	1
my	1
virtue	1
and	1
rectitude	1
alone,	1
and	1
bade	1
me	1
consider	1
the	1
disparity	1
between	1
Don	1
Fernando	1
and	1
myself,	1
from	1
which	1
I	1
might	1
conclude	1
that	1
his	1
intentions,	1
whatever	1
he	1
might	1
say	1
to	1
the	1
contrary,	1
had	1
for	1
their	1
aim	1
his	1
own	1
pleasure	1
rather	1
than	1
my	1
advantage;	1
and	1
if	1
I	1
were	1
at	1
all	1
desirous	1
of	1
opposing	1
an	1
obstacle	1
to	1
his	1
unreasonable	1
suit,	1
they	1
were	1
ready,	1
they	1
said,	1
to	1
marry	1
me	1
at	1
once	1
to	1
anyone	1
I	1
preferred,	1
either	1
among	1
the	1
leading	1
people	1
of	1
our	1
own	1
town,	1
or	1
of	1
any	1
of	1
those	1
in	1
the	1
neighbourhood;	1
for	1
with	1
their	1
wealth	1
and	1
my	1
good	1
name,	1
a	1
match	1
might	1
be	1
looked	1
for	1
in	1
any	1
quarter.	1
This	1
offer,	1
and	1
their	1
sound	1
advice	1
strengthened	1
my	1
resolution,	1
and	1
I	1
never	1
gave	1
Don	1
Fernando	1
a	1
word	1
in	1
reply	1
that	1
could	1
hold	1
out	1
to	1
him	1
any	1
hope	1
of	1
success,	1
however	1
remote.	1

“All	1
this	1
caution	1
of	1
mine,	1
which	1
he	1
must	1
have	1
taken	1
for	1
coyness,	1
had	1
apparently	1
the	1
effect	1
of	1
increasing	1
his	1
wanton	1
appetite—for	1
that	1
is	1
the	1
name	1
I	1
give	1
to	1
his	1
passion	1
for	1
me;	1
had	1
it	1
been	1
what	1
he	1
declared	1
it	1
to	1
be,	1
you	1
would	1
not	1
know	1
of	1
it	1
now,	1
because	1
there	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
no	1
occasion	1
to	1
tell	1
you	1
of	1
it.	1
At	1
length	1
he	1
learned	1
that	1
my	1
parents	1
were	1
contemplating	1
marriage	1
for	1
me	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
put	1
an	1
end	1
to	1
his	1
hopes	1
of	1
obtaining	1
possession	1
of	1
me,	1
or	1
at	1
least	1
to	1
secure	1
additional	1
protectors	1
to	1
watch	1
over	1
me,	1
and	1
this	1
intelligence	1
or	1
suspicion	1
made	1
him	1
act	1
as	1
you	1
shall	1
hear.	1
One	1
night,	1
as	1
I	1
was	1
in	1
my	1
chamber	1
with	1
no	1
other	1
companion	1
than	1
a	1
damsel	1
who	1
waited	1
on	1
me,	1
with	1
the	1
doors	1
carefully	1
locked	1
lest	1
my	1
honour	1
should	1
be	1
imperilled	1
through	1
any	1
carelessness,	1
I	1
know	1
not	1
nor	1
can	1
conceive	1
how	1
it	1
happened,	1
but,	1
with	1
all	1
this	1
seclusion	1
and	1
these	1
precautions,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
solitude	1
and	1
silence	1
of	1
my	1
retirement,	1
I	1
found	1
him	1
standing	1
before	1
me,	1
a	1
vision	1
that	1
so	1
astounded	1
me	1
that	1
it	1
deprived	1
my	1
eyes	1
of	1
sight,	1
and	1
my	1
tongue	1
of	1
speech.	1
I	1
had	1
no	1
power	1
to	1
utter	1
a	1
cry,	1
nor,	1
I	1
think,	1
did	1
he	1
give	1
me	1
time	1
to	1
utter	1
one,	1
as	1
he	1
immediately	1
approached	1
me,	1
and	1
taking	1
me	1
in	1
his	1
arms	1
(for,	1
overwhelmed	1
as	1
I	1
was,	1
I	1
was	1
powerless,	1
I	1
say,	1
to	1
help	1
myself),	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
make	1
such	1
professions	1
to	1
me	1
that	1
I	1
know	1
not	1
how	1
falsehood	1
could	1
have	1
had	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
dressing	1
them	1
up	1
to	1
seem	1
so	1
like	1
truth;	1
and	1
the	1
traitor	1
contrived	1
that	1
his	1
tears	1
should	1
vouch	1
for	1
his	1
words,	1
and	1
his	1
sighs	1
for	1
his	1
sincerity.	1
“I,	1
a	1
poor	1
young	1
creature	1
alone,	1
ill	1
versed	1
among	1
my	1
people	1
in	1
cases	1
such	1
as	1
this,	1
began,	1
I	1
know	1
not	1
how,	1
to	1
think	1
all	1
these	1
lying	1
protestations	1
true,	1
though	1
without	1
being	1
moved	1
by	1
his	1
sighs	1
and	1
tears	1
to	1
anything	1
more	1
than	1
pure	1
compassion;	1
and	1
so,	1
as	1
the	1
first	1
feeling	1
of	1
bewilderment	1
passed	1
away,	1
and	1
I	1
began	1
in	1
some	1
degree	1
to	1
recover	1
myself,	1
I	1
said	1
to	1
him	1
with	1
more	1
courage	1
than	1
I	1
thought	1
I	1
could	1
have	1
possessed,	1
‘If,	1
as	1
I	1
am	1
now	1
in	1
your	1
arms,	1
señor,	1
I	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
claws	1
of	1
a	1
fierce	1
lion,	1
and	1
my	1
deliverance	1
could	1
be	1
procured	1
by	1
doing	1
or	1
saying	1
anything	1
to	1
the	1
prejudice	1
of	1
my	1
honour,	1
it	1
would	1
no	1
more	1
be	1
in	1
my	1
power	1
to	1
do	1
it	1
or	1
say	1
it,	1
than	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
possible	1
that	1
what	1
was	1
should	1
not	1
have	1
been;	1
so	1
then,	1
if	1
you	1
hold	1
my	1
body	1
clasped	1
in	1
your	1
arms,	1
I	1
hold	1
my	1
soul	1
secured	1
by	1
virtuous	1
intentions,	1
very	1
different	1
from	1
yours,	1
as	1
you	1
will	1
see	1
if	1
you	1
attempt	1
to	1
carry	1
them	1
into	1
effect	1
by	1
force.	1
I	1
am	1
your	1
vassal,	1
but	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
your	1
slave;	1
your	1
nobility	1
neither	1
has	1
nor	1
should	1
have	1
any	1
right	1
to	1
dishonour	1
or	1
degrade	1
my	1
humble	1
birth;	1
and	1
low-born	1
peasant	1
as	1
I	1
am,	1
I	1
have	1
my	1
self-respect	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
you,	1
a	1
lord	1
and	1
gentleman:	1
with	1
me	1
your	1
violence	1
will	1
be	1
to	1
no	1
purpose,	1
your	1
wealth	1
will	1
have	1
no	1
weight,	1
your	1
words	1
will	1
have	1
no	1
power	1
to	1
deceive	1
me,	1
nor	1
your	1
sighs	1
or	1
tears	1
to	1
soften	1
me:	1
were	1
I	1
to	1
see	1
any	1
of	1
the	1
things	1
I	1
speak	1
of	1
in	1
him	1
whom	1
my	1
parents	1
gave	1
me	1
as	1
a	1
husband,	1
his	1
will	1
should	1
be	1
mine,	1
and	1
mine	1
should	1
be	1
bounded	1
by	1
his;	1
and	1
my	1
honour	1
being	1
preserved	1
even	1
though	1
my	1
inclinations	1
were	1
not	1
would	1
willingly	1
yield	1
him	1
what	1
you,	1
señor,	1
would	1
now	1
obtain	1
by	1
force;	1
and	1
this	1
I	1
say	1
lest	1
you	1
should	1
suppose	1
that	1
any	1
but	1
my	1
lawful	1
husband	1
shall	1
ever	1
win	1
anything	1
of	1
me.’	1
‘If	1
that,’	1
said	1
this	1
disloyal	1
gentleman,	1
‘be	1
the	1
only	1
scruple	1
you	1
feel,	1
fairest	1
Dorothea’	1
(for	1
that	1
is	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
this	1
unhappy	1
being),	1
‘see	1
here	1
I	1
give	1
you	1
my	1
hand	1
to	1
be	1
yours,	1
and	1
let	1
Heaven,	1
from	1
which	1
nothing	1
is	1
hid,	1
and	1
this	1
image	1
of	1
Our	1
Lady	1
you	1
have	1
here,	1
be	1
witnesses	1
of	1
this	1
pledge.’”	1

When	1
Cardenio	1
heard	1
her	1
say	1
she	1
was	1
called	1
Dorothea,	1
he	1
showed	1
fresh	1
agitation	1
and	1
felt	1
convinced	1
of	1
the	1
truth	1
of	1
his	1
former	1
suspicion,	1
but	1
he	1
was	1
unwilling	1
to	1
interrupt	1
the	1
story,	1
and	1
wished	1
to	1
hear	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
what	1
he	1
already	1
all	1
but	1
knew,	1
so	1
he	1
merely	1
said:	1
“What!	1
is	1
Dorothea	1
your	1
name,	1
señora?	1
I	1
have	1
heard	1
of	1
another	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
name	1
who	1
can	1
perhaps	1
match	1
your	1
misfortunes.	1
But	1
proceed;	1
by-and-by	1
I	1
may	1
tell	1
you	1
something	1
that	1
will	1
astonish	1
you	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
it	1
will	1
excite	1
your	1
compassion.”	1
Dorothea	1
was	1
struck	1
by	1
Cardenio’s	1
words	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
by	1
his	1
strange	1
and	1
miserable	1
attire,	1
and	1
begged	1
him	1
if	1
he	1
knew	1
anything	1
concerning	1
her	1
to	1
tell	1
it	1
to	1
her	1
at	1
once,	1
for	1
if	1
fortune	1
had	1
left	1
her	1
any	1
blessing	1
it	1
was	1
courage	1
to	1
bear	1
whatever	1
calamity	1
might	1
fall	1
upon	1
her,	1
as	1
she	1
felt	1
sure	1
that	1
none	1
could	1
reach	1
her	1
capable	1
of	1
increasing	1
in	1
any	1
degree	1
what	1
she	1
endured	1
already.	1
“I	1
would	1
not	1
let	1
the	1
occasion	1
pass,	1
señora,”	1
replied	1
Cardenio,	1
“of	1
telling	1
you	1
what	1
I	1
think,	1
if	1
what	1
I	1
suspect	1
were	1
the	1
truth,	1
but	1
so	1
far	1
there	1
has	1
been	1
no	1
opportunity,	1
nor	1
is	1
it	1
of	1
any	1
importance	1
to	1
you	1
to	1
know	1
it.”	1
“Be	1
it	1
as	1
it	1
may,”	1
replied	1
Dorothea,	1
“what	1
happened	1
in	1
my	1
story	1
was	1
that	1
Don	1
Fernando,	1
taking	1
an	1
image	1
that	1
stood	1
in	1
the	1
chamber,	1
placed	1
it	1
as	1
a	1
witness	1
of	1
our	1
betrothal,	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
most	1
binding	1
words	1
and	1
extravagant	1
oaths	1
gave	1
me	1
his	1
promise	1
to	1
become	1
my	1
husband;	1
though	1
before	1
he	1
had	1
made	1
an	1
end	1
of	1
pledging	1
himself	1
I	1
bade	1
him	1
consider	1
well	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
doing,	1
and	1
think	1
of	1
the	1
anger	1
his	1
father	1
would	1
feel	1
at	1
seeing	1
him	1
married	1
to	1
a	1
peasant	1
girl	1
and	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
vassals;	1
I	1
told	1
him	1
not	1
to	1
let	1
my	1
beauty,	1
such	1
as	1
it	1
was,	1
blind	1
him,	1
for	1
that	1
was	1
not	1
enough	1
to	1
furnish	1
an	1
excuse	1
for	1
his	1
transgression;	1
and	1
if	1
in	1
the	1
love	1
he	1
bore	1
me	1
he	1
wished	1
to	1
do	1
me	1
any	1
kindness,	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
to	1
leave	1
my	1
lot	1
to	1
follow	1
its	1
course	1
at	1
the	1
level	1
my	1
condition	1
required;	1
for	1
marriages	1
so	1
unequal	1
never	1
brought	1
happiness,	1
nor	1
did	1
they	1
continue	1
long	1
to	1
afford	1
the	1
enjoyment	1
they	1
began	1
with.	1
“All	1
this	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
now	1
repeated	1
I	1
said	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
much	1
more	1
which	1
I	1
cannot	1
recollect;	1
but	1
it	1
had	1
no	1
effect	1
in	1
inducing	1
him	1
to	1
forego	1
his	1
purpose;	1
he	1
who	1
has	1
no	1
intention	1
of	1
paying	1
does	1
not	1
trouble	1
himself	1
about	1
difficulties	1
when	1
he	1
is	1
striking	1
the	1
bargain.	1
At	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
I	1
argued	1
the	1
matter	1
briefly	1
in	1
my	1
own	1
mind,	1
saying	1
to	1
myself,	1
‘I	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
the	1
first	1
who	1
has	1
risen	1
through	1
marriage	1
from	1
a	1
lowly	1
to	1
a	1
lofty	1
station,	1
nor	1
will	1
Don	1
Fernando	1
be	1
the	1
first	1
whom	1
beauty	1
or,	1
as	1
is	1
more	1
likely,	1
a	1
blind	1
attachment,	1
has	1
led	1
to	1
mate	1
himself	1
below	1
his	1
rank.	1
Then,	1
since	1
I	1
am	1
introducing	1
no	1
new	1
usage	1
or	1
practice,	1
I	1
may	1
as	1
well	1
avail	1
myself	1
of	1
the	1
honour	1
that	1
chance	1
offers	1
me,	1
for	1
even	1
though	1
his	1
inclination	1
for	1
me	1
should	1
not	1
outlast	1
the	1
attainment	1
of	1
his	1
wishes,	1
I	1
shall	1
be,	1
after	1
all,	1
his	1
wife	1
before	1
God.	1
And	1
if	1
I	1
strive	1
to	1
repel	1
him	1
by	1
scorn,	1
I	1
can	1
see	1
that,	1
fair	1
means	1
failing,	1
he	1
is	1
in	1
a	1
mood	1
to	1
use	1
force,	1
and	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
left	1
dishonoured	1
and	1
without	1
any	1
means	1
of	1
proving	1
my	1
innocence	1
to	1
those	1
who	1
cannot	1
know	1
how	1
innocently	1
I	1
have	1
come	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
this	1
position;	1
for	1
what	1
arguments	1
would	1
persuade	1
my	1
parents	1
that	1
this	1
gentleman	1
entered	1
my	1
chamber	1
without	1
my	1
consent?’	1
“All	1
these	1
questions	1
and	1
answers	1
passed	1
through	1
my	1
mind	1
in	1
a	1
moment;	1
but	1
the	1
oaths	1
of	1
Don	1
Fernando,	1
the	1
witnesses	1
he	1
appealed	1
to,	1
the	1
tears	1
he	1
shed,	1
and	1
lastly	1
the	1
charms	1
of	1
his	1
person	1
and	1
his	1
high-bred	1
grace,	1
which,	1
accompanied	1
by	1
such	1
signs	1
of	1
genuine	1
love,	1
might	1
well	1
have	1
conquered	1
a	1
heart	1
even	1
more	1
free	1
and	1
coy	1
than	1
mine—these	1
were	1
the	1
things	1
that	1
more	1
than	1
all	1
began	1
to	1
influence	1
me	1
and	1
lead	1
me	1
unawares	1
to	1
my	1
ruin.	1
I	1
called	1
my	1
waiting-maid	1
to	1
me,	1
that	1
there	1
might	1
be	1
a	1
witness	1
on	1
earth	1
besides	1
those	1
in	1
Heaven,	1
and	1
again	1
Don	1
Fernando	1
renewed	1
and	1
repeated	1
his	1
oaths,	1
invoked	1
as	1
witnesses	1
fresh	1
saints	1
in	1
addition	1
to	1
the	1
former	1
ones,	1
called	1
down	1
upon	1
himself	1
a	1
thousand	1
curses	1
hereafter	1
should	1
he	1
fail	1
to	1
keep	1
his	1
promise,	1
shed	1
more	1
tears,	1
redoubled	1
his	1
sighs	1
and	1
pressed	1
me	1
closer	1
in	1
his	1
arms,	1
from	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
never	1
allowed	1
me	1
to	1
escape;	1
and	1
so	1
I	1
was	1
left	1
by	1
my	1
maid,	1
and	1
ceased	1
to	1
be	1
one,	1
and	1
he	1
became	1
a	1
traitor	1
and	1
a	1
perjured	1
man.	1
“The	1
day	1
which	1
followed	1
the	1
night	1
of	1
my	1
misfortune	1
did	1
not	1
come	1
so	1
quickly,	1
I	1
imagine,	1
as	1
Don	1
Fernando	1
wished,	1
for	1
when	1
desire	1
has	1
attained	1
its	1
object,	1
the	1
greatest	1
pleasure	1
is	1
to	1
fly	1
from	1
the	1
scene	1
of	1
pleasure.	1
I	1
say	1
so	1
because	1
Don	1
Fernando	1
made	1
all	1
haste	1
to	1
leave	1
me,	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
adroitness	1
of	1
my	1
maid,	1
who	1
was	1
indeed	1
the	1
one	1
who	1
had	1
admitted	1
him,	1
gained	1
the	1
street	1
before	1
daybreak;	1
but	1
on	1
taking	1
leave	1
of	1
me	1
he	1
told	1
me,	1
though	1
not	1
with	1
as	1
much	1
earnestness	1
and	1
fervour	1
as	1
when	1
he	1
came,	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
rest	1
assured	1
of	1
his	1
faith	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
sanctity	1
and	1
sincerity	1
of	1
his	1
oaths;	1
and	1
to	1
confirm	1
his	1
words	1
he	1
drew	1
a	1
rich	1
ring	1
off	1
his	1
finger	1
and	1
placed	1
it	1
upon	1
mine.	1
He	1
then	1
took	1
his	1
departure	1
and	1
I	1
was	1
left,	1
I	1
know	1
not	1
whether	1
sorrowful	1
or	1
happy;	1
all	1
I	1
can	1
say	1
is,	1
I	1
was	1
left	1
agitated	1
and	1
troubled	1
in	1
mind	1
and	1
almost	1
bewildered	1
by	1
what	1
had	1
taken	1
place,	1
and	1
I	1
had	1
not	1
the	1
spirit,	1
or	1
else	1
it	1
did	1
not	1
occur	1
to	1
me,	1
to	1
chide	1
my	1
maid	1
for	1
the	1
treachery	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
guilty	1
of	1
in	1
concealing	1
Don	1
Fernando	1
in	1
my	1
chamber;	1
for	1
as	1
yet	1
I	1
was	1
unable	1
to	1
make	1
up	1
my	1
mind	1
whether	1
what	1
had	1
befallen	1
me	1
was	1
for	1
good	1
or	1
evil.	1
I	1
told	1
Don	1
Fernando	1
at	1
parting,	1
that	1
as	1
I	1
was	1
now	1
his,	1
he	1
might	1
see	1
me	1
on	1
other	1
nights	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
way,	1
until	1
it	1
should	1
be	1
his	1
pleasure	1
to	1
let	1
the	1
matter	1
become	1
known;	1
but,	1
except	1
the	1
following	1
night,	1
he	1
came	1
no	1
more,	1
nor	1
for	1
more	1
than	1
a	1
month	1
could	1
I	1
catch	1
a	1
glimpse	1
of	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
street	1
or	1
in	1
church,	1
while	1
I	1
wearied	1
myself	1
with	1
watching	1
for	1
one;	1
although	1
I	1
knew	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
town,	1
and	1
almost	1
every	1
day	1
went	1
out	1
hunting,	1
a	1
pastime	1
he	1
was	1
very	1
fond	1
of.	1
I	1
remember	1
well	1
how	1
sad	1
and	1
dreary	1
those	1
days	1
and	1
hours	1
were	1
to	1
me;	1
I	1
remember	1
well	1
how	1
I	1
began	1
to	1
doubt	1
as	1
they	1
went	1
by,	1
and	1
even	1
to	1
lose	1
confidence	1
in	1
the	1
faith	1
of	1
Don	1
Fernando;	1
and	1
I	1
remember,	1
too,	1
how	1
my	1
maid	1
heard	1
those	1
words	1
in	1
reproof	1
of	1
her	1
audacity	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
not	1
heard	1
before,	1
and	1
how	1
I	1
was	1
forced	1
to	1
put	1
a	1
constraint	1
on	1
my	1
tears	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
expression	1
of	1
my	1
countenance,	1
not	1
to	1
give	1
my	1
parents	1
cause	1
to	1
ask	1
me	1
why	1
I	1
was	1
so	1
melancholy,	1
and	1
drive	1
me	1
to	1
invent	1
falsehoods	1
in	1
reply.	1
But	1
all	1
this	1
was	1
suddenly	1
brought	1
to	1
an	1
end,	1
for	1
the	1
time	1
came	1
when	1
all	1
such	1
considerations	1
were	1
disregarded,	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
further	1
question	1
of	1
honour,	1
when	1
my	1
patience	1
gave	1
way	1
and	1
the	1
secret	1
of	1
my	1
heart	1
became	1
known	1
abroad.	1
The	1
reason	1
was,	1
that	1
a	1
few	1
days	1
later	1
it	1
was	1
reported	1
in	1
the	1
town	1
that	1
Don	1
Fernando	1
had	1
been	1
married	1
in	1
a	1
neighbouring	1
city	1
to	1
a	1
maiden	1
of	1
rare	1
beauty,	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
parents	1
of	1
distinguished	1
position,	1
though	1
not	1
so	1
rich	1
that	1
her	1
portion	1
would	1
entitle	1
her	1
to	1
look	1
for	1
so	1
brilliant	1
a	1
match;	1
it	1
was	1
said,	1
too,	1
that	1
her	1
name	1
was	1
Luscinda,	1
and	1
that	1
at	1
the	1
betrothal	1
some	1
strange	1
things	1
had	1
happened.”	1
Cardenio	1
heard	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Luscinda,	1
but	1
he	1
only	1
shrugged	1
his	1
shoulders,	1
bit	1
his	1
lips,	1
bent	1
his	1
brows,	1
and	1
before	1
long	1
two	1
streams	1
of	1
tears	1
escaped	1
from	1
his	1
eyes.	1
Dorothea,	1
however,	1
did	1
not	1
interrupt	1
her	1
story,	1
but	1
went	1
on	1
in	1
these	1
words:	1
“This	1
sad	1
intelligence	1
reached	1
my	1
ears,	1
and,	1
instead	1
of	1
being	1
struck	1
with	1
a	1
chill,	1
with	1
such	1
wrath	1
and	1
fury	1
did	1
my	1
heart	1
burn	1
that	1
I	1
scarcely	1
restrained	1
myself	1
from	1
rushing	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
streets,	1
crying	1
aloud	1
and	1
proclaiming	1
openly	1
the	1
perfidy	1
and	1
treachery	1
of	1
which	1
I	1
was	1
the	1
victim;	1
but	1
this	1
transport	1
of	1
rage	1
was	1
for	1
the	1
time	1
checked	1
by	1
a	1
resolution	1
I	1
formed,	1
to	1
be	1
carried	1
out	1
the	1
same	1
night,	1
and	1
that	1
was	1
to	1
assume	1
this	1
dress,	1
which	1
I	1
got	1
from	1
a	1
servant	1
of	1
my	1
father’s,	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
zagals,	1
as	1
they	1
are	1
called	1
in	1
farmhouses,	1
to	1
whom	1
I	1
confided	1
the	1
whole	1
of	1
my	1
misfortune,	1
and	1
whom	1
I	1
entreated	1
to	1
accompany	1
me	1
to	1
the	1
city	1
where	1
I	1
heard	1
my	1
enemy	1
was.	1
He,	1
though	1
he	1
remonstrated	1
with	1
me	1
for	1
my	1
boldness,	1
and	1
condemned	1
my	1
resolution,	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
me	1
bent	1
upon	1
my	1
purpose,	1
offered	1
to	1
bear	1
me	1
company,	1
as	1
he	1
said,	1
to	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
world.	1
I	1
at	1
once	1
packed	1
up	1
in	1
a	1
linen	1
pillow-case	1
a	1
woman’s	1
dress,	1
and	1
some	1
jewels	1
and	1
money	1
to	1
provide	1
for	1
emergencies,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
silence	1
of	1
the	1
night,	1
without	1
letting	1
my	1
treacherous	1
maid	1
know,	1
I	1
sallied	1
forth	1
from	1
the	1
house,	1
accompanied	1
by	1
my	1
servant	1
and	1
abundant	1
anxieties,	1
and	1
on	1
foot	1
set	1
out	1
for	1
the	1
city,	1
but	1
borne	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
on	1
wings	1
by	1
my	1
eagerness	1
to	1
reach	1
it,	1
if	1
not	1
to	1
prevent	1
what	1
I	1
presumed	1
to	1
be	1
already	1
done,	1
at	1
least	1
to	1
call	1
upon	1
Don	1
Fernando	1
to	1
tell	1
me	1
with	1
what	1
conscience	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
it.	1
I	1
reached	1
my	1
destination	1
in	1
two	1
days	1
and	1
a	1
half,	1
and	1
on	1
entering	1
the	1
city	1
inquired	1
for	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Luscinda’s	1
parents.	1
The	1
first	1
person	1
I	1
asked	1
gave	1
me	1
more	1
in	1
reply	1
than	1
I	1
sought	1
to	1
know;	1
he	1
showed	1
me	1
the	1
house,	1
and	1
told	1
me	1
all	1
that	1
had	1
occurred	1
at	1
the	1
betrothal	1
of	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
the	1
family,	1
an	1
affair	1
of	1
such	1
notoriety	1
in	1
the	1
city	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
talk	1
of	1
every	1
knot	1
of	1
idlers	1
in	1
the	1
street.	1
He	1
said	1
that	1
on	1
the	1
night	1
of	1
Don	1
Fernando’s	1
betrothal	1
with	1
Luscinda,	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
she	1
had	1
consented	1
to	1
be	1
his	1
bride	1
by	1
saying	1
‘Yes,’	1
she	1
was	1
taken	1
with	1
a	1
sudden	1
fainting	1
fit,	1
and	1
that	1
on	1
the	1
bridegroom	1
approaching	1
to	1
unlace	1
the	1
bosom	1
of	1
her	1
dress	1
to	1
give	1
her	1
air,	1
he	1
found	1
a	1
paper	1
in	1
her	1
own	1
handwriting,	1
in	1
which	1
she	1
said	1
and	1
declared	1
that	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
Don	1
Fernando’s	1
bride,	1
because	1
she	1
was	1
already	1
Cardenio’s,	1
who,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
man’s	1
account,	1
was	1
a	1
gentleman	1
of	1
distinction	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
city;	1
and	1
that	1
if	1
she	1
had	1
accepted	1
Don	1
Fernando,	1
it	1
was	1
only	1
in	1
obedience	1
to	1
her	1
parents.	1
In	1
short,	1
he	1
said,	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
paper	1
made	1
it	1
clear	1
she	1
meant	1
to	1
kill	1
herself	1
on	1
the	1
completion	1
of	1
the	1
betrothal,	1
and	1
gave	1
her	1
reasons	1
for	1
putting	1
an	1
end	1
to	1
herself	1
all	1
which	1
was	1
confirmed,	1
it	1
was	1
said,	1
by	1
a	1
dagger	1
they	1
found	1
somewhere	1
in	1
her	1
clothes.	1
On	1
seeing	1
this,	1
Don	1
Fernando,	1
persuaded	1
that	1
Luscinda	1
had	1
befooled,	1
slighted,	1
and	1
trifled	1
with	1
him,	1
assailed	1
her	1
before	1
she	1
had	1
recovered	1
from	1
her	1
swoon,	1
and	1
tried	1
to	1
stab	1
her	1
with	1
the	1
dagger	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
found,	1
and	1
would	1
have	1
succeeded	1
had	1
not	1
her	1
parents	1
and	1
those	1
who	1
were	1
present	1
prevented	1
him.	1
It	1
was	1
said,	1
moreover,	1
that	1
Don	1
Fernando	1
went	1
away	1
at	1
once,	1
and	1
that	1
Luscinda	1
did	1
not	1
recover	1
from	1
her	1
prostration	1
until	1
the	1
next	1
day,	1
when	1
she	1
told	1
her	1
parents	1
how	1
she	1
was	1
really	1
the	1
bride	1
of	1
that	1
Cardenio	1
I	1
have	1
mentioned.	1
I	1
learned	1
besides	1
that	1
Cardenio,	1
according	1
to	1
report,	1
had	1
been	1
present	1
at	1
the	1
betrothal;	1
and	1
that	1
upon	1
seeing	1
her	1
betrothed	1
contrary	1
to	1
his	1
expectation,	1
he	1
had	1
quitted	1
the	1
city	1
in	1
despair,	1
leaving	1
behind	1
him	1
a	1
letter	1
declaring	1
the	1
wrong	1
Luscinda	1
had	1
done	1
him,	1
and	1
his	1
intention	1
of	1
going	1
where	1
no	1
one	1
should	1
ever	1
see	1
him	1
again.	1
All	1
this	1
was	1
a	1
matter	1
of	1
notoriety	1
in	1
the	1
city,	1
and	1
everyone	1
spoke	1
of	1
it;	1
especially	1
when	1
it	1
became	1
known	1
that	1
Luscinda	1
was	1
missing	1
from	1
her	1
father’s	1
house	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
city,	1
for	1
she	1
was	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
found	1
anywhere,	1
to	1
the	1
distraction	1
of	1
her	1
parents,	1
who	1
knew	1
not	1
what	1
steps	1
to	1
take	1
to	1
recover	1
her.	1
What	1
I	1
learned	1
revived	1
my	1
hopes,	1
and	1
I	1
was	1
better	1
pleased	1
not	1
to	1
have	1
found	1
Don	1
Fernando	1
than	1
to	1
find	1
him	1
married,	1
for	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
me	1
that	1
the	1
door	1
was	1
not	1
yet	1
entirely	1
shut	1
upon	1
relief	1
in	1
my	1
case,	1
and	1
I	1
thought	1
that	1
perhaps	1
Heaven	1
had	1
put	1
this	1
impediment	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
the	1
second	1
marriage,	1
to	1
lead	1
him	1
to	1
recognise	1
his	1
obligations	1
under	1
the	1
former	1
one,	1
and	1
reflect	1
that	1
as	1
a	1
Christian	1
he	1
was	1
bound	1
to	1
consider	1
his	1
soul	1
above	1
all	1
human	1
objects.	1
All	1
this	1
passed	1
through	1
my	1
mind,	1
and	1
I	1
strove	1
to	1
comfort	1
myself	1
without	1
comfort,	1
indulging	1
in	1
faint	1
and	1
distant	1
hopes	1
of	1
cherishing	1
that	1
life	1
that	1
I	1
now	1
abhor.	1
“But	1
while	1
I	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
city,	1
uncertain	1
what	1
to	1
do,	1
as	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
find	1
Don	1
Fernando,	1
I	1
heard	1
notice	1
given	1
by	1
the	1
public	1
crier	1
offering	1
a	1
great	1
reward	1
to	1
anyone	1
who	1
should	1
find	1
me,	1
and	1
giving	1
the	1
particulars	1
of	1
my	1
age	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
very	1
dress	1
I	1
wore;	1
and	1
I	1
heard	1
it	1
said	1
that	1
the	1
lad	1
who	1
came	1
with	1
me	1
had	1
taken	1
me	1
away	1
from	1
my	1
father’s	1
house;	1
a	1
thing	1
that	1
cut	1
me	1
to	1
the	1
heart,	1
showing	1
how	1
low	1
my	1
good	1
name	1
had	1
fallen,	1
since	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
enough	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
lose	1
it	1
by	1
my	1
flight,	1
but	1
they	1
must	1
add	1
with	1
whom	1
I	1
had	1
fled,	1
and	1
that	1
one	1
so	1
much	1
beneath	1
me	1
and	1
so	1
unworthy	1
of	1
my	1
consideration.	1
The	1
instant	1
I	1
heard	1
the	1
notice	1
I	1
quitted	1
the	1
city	1
with	1
my	1
servant,	1
who	1
now	1
began	1
to	1
show	1
signs	1
of	1
wavering	1
in	1
his	1
fidelity	1
to	1
me,	1
and	1
the	1
same	1
night,	1
for	1
fear	1
of	1
discovery,	1
we	1
entered	1
the	1
most	1
thickly	1
wooded	1
part	1
of	1
these	1
mountains.	1
But,	1
as	1
is	1
commonly	1
said,	1
one	1
evil	1
calls	1
up	1
another	1
and	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
one	1
misfortune	1
is	1
apt	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
one	1
still	1
greater,	1
and	1
so	1
it	1
proved	1
in	1
my	1
case;	1
for	1
my	1
worthy	1
servant,	1
until	1
then	1
so	1
faithful	1
and	1
trusty	1
when	1
he	1
found	1
me	1
in	1
this	1
lonely	1
spot,	1
moved	1
more	1
by	1
his	1
own	1
villainy	1
than	1
by	1
my	1
beauty,	1
sought	1
to	1
take	1
advantage	1
of	1
the	1
opportunity	1
which	1
these	1
solitudes	1
seemed	1
to	1
present	1
him,	1
and	1
with	1
little	1
shame	1
and	1
less	1
fear	1
of	1
God	1
and	1
respect	1
for	1
me,	1
began	1
to	1
make	1
overtures	1
to	1
me;	1
and	1
finding	1
that	1
I	1
replied	1
to	1
the	1
effrontery	1
of	1
his	1
proposals	1
with	1
justly	1
severe	1
language,	1
he	1
laid	1
aside	1
the	1
entreaties	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
employed	1
at	1
first,	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
use	1
violence.	1

just	1
Heaven,	1

good	1

so	1
aided	1
mine	1
that	1
with	1
my	1
slight	1
strength	1
and	1
with	1
little	1
exertion	1
I	1
pushed	1

over	1
a	1

where	1
I	1
left	1
him,	1
whether	1
dead	1

then,	1
with	1
greater	1

seemed	1
possible	1
in	1
my	1
terror	1

I	1
made	1

despatched	1

search	1
of	1

by	1
his	1
orders.	1
It	1
is	1
now	1
I	1
know	1
not	1
how	1
many	1
months	1
since	1
with	1
this	1
object	1
I	1
came	1
here,	1
where	1
I	1
met	1
a	1
herdsman	1
who	1
engaged	1
me	1
as	1
his	1
servant	1
at	1
a	1
place	1
in	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
this	1
Sierra,	1
and	1
all	1
this	1
time	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
serving	1
him	1
as	1
herd,	1
striving	1
to	1
keep	1
always	1
afield	1
to	1
hide	1
these	1
locks	1
which	1
have	1
now	1
unexpectedly	1
betrayed	1
me.	1
But	1
all	1
my	1
care	1
and	1
pains	1
were	1
unavailing,	1
for	1
my	1
master	1
made	1
the	1
discovery	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
man,	1
and	1
harboured	1
the	1
same	1
base	1
designs	1
as	1
my	1
servant;	1
and	1
as	1
fortune	1
does	1
not	1
always	1
supply	1
a	1
remedy	1
in	1
cases	1
of	1
difficulty,	1
and	1
I	1
had	1
no	1
precipice	1
or	1
ravine	1
at	1
hand	1
down	1
which	1
to	1
fling	1
the	1
master	1
and	1
cure	1
his	1
passion,	1
as	1
I	1
had	1
in	1
the	1
servant’s	1
case,	1
I	1
thought	1
it	1
a	1
lesser	1
evil	1
to	1
leave	1
him	1
and	1
again	1
conceal	1
myself	1
among	1
these	1
crags,	1
than	1
make	1
trial	1
of	1
my	1
strength	1
and	1
argument	1
with	1
him.	1
So,	1
as	1
I	1
say,	1
once	1
more	1
I	1
went	1
into	1
hiding	1
to	1
seek	1
for	1
some	1
place	1
where	1
I	1
might	1
with	1
sighs	1
and	1
tears	1
implore	1
Heaven	1
to	1
have	1
pity	1
on	1
my	1
misery,	1
and	1
grant	1
me	1
help	1
and	1
strength	1
to	1
escape	1
from	1
it,	1
or	1
let	1
me	1
die	1
among	1
the	1
solitudes,	1
leaving	1
no	1
trace	1
of	1
an	1
unhappy	1
being	1
who,	1
by	1
no	1
fault	1
of	1
hers,	1
has	1
furnished	1
matter	1
for	1
talk	1
and	1
scandal	1
at	1
home	1

“Such,	1
sirs,	1
is	1
the	1
true	1
story	1
of	1
my	1
sad	1
adventures;	1
judge	1
for	1
yourselves	1
now	1
whether	1
the	1
sighs	1
and	1
lamentations	1
you	1
heard,	1
and	1
the	1
tears	1
that	1
flowed	1
from	1
my	1
eyes,	1
had	1
not	1
sufficient	1
cause	1
even	1
if	1
I	1
had	1
indulged	1
in	1
them	1
more	1
freely;	1
and	1
if	1
you	1
consider	1
the	1
nature	1
of	1
my	1
misfortune	1
you	1
will	1
see	1
that	1
consolation	1
is	1
idle,	1
as	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
possible	1
remedy	1
for	1
it.	1
All	1
I	1
ask	1
of	1
you	1
is,	1
what	1
you	1
may	1
easily	1

reasonably	1
do,	1
to	1

dread	1

those	1

of	1
me;	1
for	1
though	1
the	1
great	1

my	1

bear	1
me	1
makes	1
me	1
feel	1
sure	1
of	1
being	1
kindly	1
received	1

them,	1
so	1
great	1
is	1
my	1
feeling	1

shame	1
at	1
the	1
mere	1
thought	1
that	1
I	1
cannot	1
present	1
myself	1
before	1
them	1
as	1
they	1
expect,	1
that	1
I	1
had	1
rather	1
banish	1
myself	1
from	1
their	1
sight	1
for	1
ever	1
than	1
look	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
face	1
with	1
the	1
reflection	1
that	1
they	1
beheld	1
mine	1
stripped	1
of	1
that	1
purity	1
they	1
had	1
a	1
right	1
to	1
expect	1
in	1
me.”	1
With	1
these	1
words	1
she	1
became	1
silent,	1
and	1
the	1
colour	1
that	1
overspread	1
her	1
face	1
showed	1
plainly	1
the	1
pain	1
and	1
shame	1
she	1
was	1
suffering	1
at	1
heart.	1
In	1
theirs	1
the	1
listeners	1
felt	1
as	1
much	1
pity	1
as	1
wonder	1
at	1
her	1
misfortunes;	1
but	1
as	1
the	1
curate	1
was	1
just	1
about	1
to	1
offer	1
her	1
some	1
consolation	1
and	1
advice	1
Cardenio	1
forestalled	1
him,	1
saying,	1
“So	1
then,	1
señora,	1
you	1
are	1
the	1
fair	1
Dorothea,	1
the	1
only	1
daughter	1
of	1
the	1
rich	1
Clenardo?”	1
Dorothea	1
was	1
astonished	1
at	1
hearing	1
her	1
father’s	1
name,	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
miserable	1
appearance	1
of	1
him	1
who	1
mentioned	1
it,	1
for	1
it	1
has	1
been	1
already	1
said	1
how	1
wretchedly	1
clad	1
Cardenio	1
was;	1
so	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
him:	1
“And	1
who	1
may	1
you	1
be,	1
brother,	1
who	1
seem	1
to	1
know	1
my	1
father’s	1
name	1
so	1
well?	1
For	1
so	1
far,	1
if	1
I	1
remember	1
rightly,	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
mentioned	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
whole	1
story	1
of	1
my	1
misfortunes.”	1
“I	1
am	1
that	1
unhappy	1
being,	1
señora,”	1
replied	1
Cardenio,	1
“whom,	1
as	1
you	1
have	1
said,	1
Luscinda	1
declared	1
to	1
be	1
her	1
husband;	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
unfortunate	1
Cardenio,	1
whom	1
the	1
wrong-doing	1
of	1
him	1
who	1
has	1
brought	1
you	1
to	1
your	1
present	1
condition	1
has	1
reduced	1
to	1
the	1
state	1
you	1
see	1
me	1
in,	1
bare,	1
ragged,	1
bereft	1
of	1
all	1
human	1
comfort,	1
and	1
what	1
is	1
worse,	1
of	1
reason,	1
for	1
I	1
only	1
possess	1
it	1
when	1
Heaven	1
is	1
pleased	1
for	1
some	1
short	1
space	1
to	1
restore	1
it	1
to	1
me.	1
I,	1
Dorothea,	1
am	1
he	1
who	1
witnessed	1
the	1
wrong	1
done	1
by	1
Don	1
Fernando,	1
and	1
waited	1
to	1
hear	1
the	1
‘Yes’	1
uttered	1
by	1
which	1
Luscinda	1
owned	1
herself	1
his	1
betrothed:	1
I	1
am	1
he	1
who	1
had	1
not	1
courage	1
enough	1
to	1
see	1
how	1
her	1
fainting	1
fit	1
ended,	1
or	1
what	1
came	1
of	1
the	1
paper	1
that	1
was	1
found	1
in	1
her	1
bosom,	1
because	1
my	1
heart	1
had	1
not	1
the	1
fortitude	1
to	1
endure	1
so	1
many	1
strokes	1
of	1
ill-fortune	1
at	1
once;	1
and	1
so	1
losing	1
patience	1
I	1
quitted	1
the	1
house,	1
and	1
leaving	1
a	1
letter	1
with	1
my	1
host,	1
which	1
I	1
entreated	1
him	1
to	1
place	1
in	1
Luscinda’s	1
hands,	1
I	1
betook	1
myself	1
to	1
these	1
solitudes,	1
resolved	1
to	1
end	1
here	1
the	1
life	1
I	1
hated	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
my	1
mortal	1
enemy.	1
But	1
fate	1
would	1
not	1
rid	1
me	1
of	1
it,	1
contenting	1
itself	1
with	1
robbing	1
me	1
of	1
my	1
reason,	1
perhaps	1
to	1
preserve	1
me	1
for	1
the	1
good	1
fortune	1
I	1
have	1
had	1
in	1
meeting	1
you;	1
for	1
if	1
that	1
which	1
you	1
have	1
just	1
told	1
us	1
be	1
true,	1
as	1
I	1
believe	1
it	1
to	1
be,	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
that	1
Heaven	1
has	1
yet	1
in	1
store	1
for	1
both	1
of	1
us	1
a	1
happier	1
termination	1
to	1
our	1
misfortunes	1
than	1
we	1
look	1
for;	1
because	1
seeing	1
that	1
Luscinda	1
cannot	1
marry	1
Don	1
Fernando,	1
being	1
mine,	1
as	1
she	1
has	1
herself	1
so	1
openly	1
declared,	1
and	1
that	1
Don	1
Fernando	1
cannot	1
marry	1
her	1
as	1
he	1
is	1
yours,	1
we	1
may	1
reasonably	1
hope	1
that	1
Heaven	1
will	1
restore	1
to	1
us	1
what	1
is	1
ours,	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
still	1
in	1
existence	1
and	1
not	1
yet	1
alienated	1
or	1
destroyed.	1
And	1
as	1
we	1
have	1
this	1
consolation	1
springing	1
from	1
no	1
very	1
visionary	1
hope	1
or	1
wild	1
fancy,	1
I	1
entreat	1
you,	1
señora,	1
to	1
form	1
new	1
resolutions	1
in	1
your	1
better	1
mind,	1
as	1
I	1
mean	1
to	1
do	1
in	1
mine,	1
preparing	1
yourself	1
to	1
look	1
forward	1
to	1
happier	1
fortunes;	1
for	1
I	1
swear	1
to	1
you	1
by	1
the	1
faith	1
of	1
a	1
gentleman	1
and	1
a	1
Christian	1
not	1
to	1
desert	1
you	1
until	1
I	1
see	1
you	1
in	1
possession	1
of	1
Don	1
Fernando,	1
and	1
if	1
I	1
cannot	1
by	1
words	1
induce	1
him	1
to	1
recognise	1
his	1
obligation	1
to	1
you,	1
in	1
that	1
case	1
to	1
avail	1
myself	1
of	1
the	1
right	1
which	1
my	1
rank	1
as	1
a	1
gentleman	1
gives	1
me,	1
and	1
with	1
just	1
cause	1
challenge	1
him	1
on	1
account	1
of	1
the	1
injury	1
he	1
has	1
done	1
you,	1
not	1
regarding	1
my	1
own	1
wrongs,	1
which	1
I	1
shall	1
leave	1
to	1
Heaven	1
to	1
avenge,	1
while	1
I	1
on	1
earth	1
devote	1
myself	1
to	1
yours.”	1
Cardenio’s	1
words	1
completed	1
the	1
astonishment	1
of	1
Dorothea,	1
and	1
not	1
knowing	1
how	1
to	1
return	1
thanks	1
for	1
such	1
an	1
offer,	1
she	1
attempted	1
to	1
kiss	1
his	1
feet;	1
but	1
Cardenio	1
would	1
not	1
permit	1
it,	1
and	1
the	1
licentiate	1
replied	1
for	1
both,	1
commended	1
the	1
sound	1
reasoning	1
of	1
Cardenio,	1
and	1
lastly,	1
begged,	1
advised,	1
and	1
urged	1
them	1
to	1
come	1
with	1
him	1
to	1
his	1
village,	1
where	1
they	1
might	1
furnish	1
themselves	1
with	1
what	1
they	1
needed,	1
and	1
take	1
measures	1
to	1
discover	1
Don	1
Fernando,	1
or	1
restore	1
Dorothea	1
to	1
her	1
parents,	1
or	1
do	1
what	1
seemed	1
to	1
them	1
most	1
advisable.	1
Cardenio	1
and	1
Dorothea	1
thanked	1
him,	1
and	1
accepted	1
the	1
kind	1
offer	1
he	1
made	1
them;	1
and	1
the	1
barber,	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
listening	1
to	1
all	1
attentively	1
and	1
in	1
silence,	1
on	1
his	1
part	1
some	1
kindly	1
words	1
also,	1
and	1
with	1
no	1
less	1
good-will	1
than	1
the	1
curate	1
offered	1
his	1
services	1
in	1
any	1
way	1
that	1
might	1
be	1
of	1
use	1
to	1
them.	1
He	1
also	1
explained	1
to	1
them	1
in	1
a	1
few	1
words	1
the	1
object	1
that	1
had	1
brought	1
them	1
there,	1
and	1
the	1
strange	1
nature	1
of	1
Don	1
Quixote’s	1
madness,	1
and	1
how	1
they	1
were	1
waiting	1
for	1
his	1
squire,	1
who	1
had	1
gone	1
in	1
search	1
of	1
him.	1
Like	1
the	1
recollection	1
of	1
a	1
dream,	1
the	1
quarrel	1
he	1
had	1
had	1
with	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
came	1
back	1
to	1
Cardenio’s	1
memory,	1
and	1
he	1
described	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
others;	1
but	1
he	1
was	1
unable	1
to	1
say	1
what	1
the	1
dispute	1
was	1
about.	1

At	1
this	1
moment	1
they	1
heard	1
a	1
shout,	1
and	1
recognised	1
it	1
as	1
coming	1
from	1
Sancho	1
Panza,	1
who,	1
not	1
finding	1
them	1
where	1
he	1
had	1
left	1
them,	1
was	1
calling	1
aloud	1
to	1
them.	1
They	1
went	1
to	1
meet	1
him,	1
and	1
in	1
answer	1
to	1
their	1
inquiries	1
about	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
he	1
told	1
them	1
how	1
he	1
had	1
found	1
him	1
stripped	1
to	1
his	1
shirt,	1
lank,	1
yellow,	1
half	1
dead	1
with	1
hunger,	1
and	1
sighing	1
for	1
his	1
lady	1
Dulcinea;	1
and	1
although	1
he	1
had	1
told	1
him	1
that	1
she	1
commanded	1
him	1
to	1
quit	1
that	1
place	1
and	1
come	1
to	1
El	1
Toboso,	1
where	1
she	1
was	1
expecting	1
him,	1
he	1
had	1
answered	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
determined	1
not	1
to	1
appear	1
in	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
her	1
beauty	1
until	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
deeds	1
to	1
make	1
him	1
worthy	1
of	1
her	1
favour;	1
and	1
if	1
this	1
went	1
on,	1
Sancho	1
said,	1
he	1
ran	1
the	1
risk	1
of	1
not	1
becoming	1
an	1
emperor	1
as	1
in	1
duty	1
bound,	1
or	1
even	1
an	1
archbishop,	1
which	1
was	1
the	1
least	1
he	1
could	1
be;	1
for	1
which	1
reason	1
they	1
ought	1
to	1
consider	1
what	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
done	1
to	1
get	1
him	1
away	1
from	1
there.	1
The	1
licentiate	1
in	1
reply	1
told	1
him	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
uneasy,	1
for	1
they	1
would	1
fetch	1
him	1
away	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
himself.	1
He	1
then	1
told	1
Cardenio	1
and	1
Dorothea	1
what	1
they	1
had	1
proposed	1
to	1
do	1
to	1
cure	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
or	1
at	1
any	1
rate	1
take	1
him	1
home;	1
upon	1
which	1
Dorothea	1
said	1
that	1
she	1
could	1
play	1
the	1
distressed	1
damsel	1
better	1
than	1
the	1
barber;	1
especially	1
as	1
she	1
had	1
there	1
the	1
dress	1
in	1
which	1
to	1
do	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
life,	1
and	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
trust	1
to	1
her	1
acting	1
the	1
part	1
in	1
every	1
particular	1
requisite	1
for	1
carrying	1
out	1
their	1
scheme,	1
for	1
she	1
had	1
read	1
a	1
great	1
many	1
books	1
of	1
chivalry,	1
and	1
knew	1
exactly	1
the	1
style	1
in	1
which	1
afflicted	1
damsels	1
begged	1
boons	1
of	1
knights-errant.	1
“In	1
that	1
case,”	1
said	1
the	1
curate,	1
“there	1
is	1
nothing	1
more	1
required	1
than	1
to	1
set	1
about	1
it	1
at	1
once,	1
for	1
beyond	1
a	1
doubt	1
fortune	1
is	1
declaring	1
itself	1
in	1
our	1
favour,	1
since	1
it	1
has	1
so	1
unexpectedly	1
begun	1
to	1
open	1
a	1
door	1
for	1
your	1
relief,	1
and	1
smoothed	1
the	1
way	1
for	1
us	1
to	1
our	1
object.”	1
Dorothea	1
then	1
took	1
out	1
of	1
her	1
pillow-case	1
a	1
complete	1
petticoat	1
of	1
some	1
rich	1
stuff,	1
and	1
a	1
green	1
mantle	1
of	1
some	1
other	1
fine	1
material,	1
and	1
a	1
necklace	1
and	1
other	1
ornaments	1
out	1
of	1
a	1
little	1
box,	1
and	1
with	1
these	1
in	1
an	1
instant	1
she	1
so	1
arrayed	1
herself	1
that	1
she	1
looked	1
like	1
a	1
great	1
and	1
rich	1
lady.	1
All	1
this,	1
and	1
more,	1
she	1
said,	1
she	1
had	1
taken	1
from	1
home	1
in	1
case	1
of	1
need,	1
but	1
that	1
until	1
then	1
she	1
had	1
had	1
no	1
occasion	1
to	1
make	1
use	1
of	1
it.	1
They	1
were	1
all	1
highly	1
delighted	1
with	1
her	1
grace,	1
air,	1
and	1
beauty,	1
and	1
declared	1
Don	1
Fernando	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
very	1
little	1
taste	1
when	1
he	1
rejected	1
such	1
charms.	1
But	1
the	1
one	1
who	1
admired	1
her	1
most	1
was	1
Sancho	1
Panza,	1
for	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
(what	1
indeed	1
was	1
true)	1
that	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
his	1
life	1
he	1
had	1
never	1
seen	1
such	1
a	1
lovely	1
creature;	1
and	1
he	1
asked	1
the	1
curate	1
with	1
great	1
eagerness	1
who	1
this	1
beautiful	1
lady	1
was,	1
and	1
what	1
she	1
wanted	1
in	1
these	1
out-of-the-way	1
quarters.	1
“This	1
fair	1
lady,	1
brother	1
Sancho,”	1
replied	1
the	1
curate,	1
“is	1
no	1
less	1
a	1
personage	1
than	1
the	1
heiress	1
in	1
the	1
direct	1
male	1
line	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
kingdom	1
of	1
Micomicon,	1
who	1
has	1
come	1
in	1
search	1
of	1
your	1
master	1
to	1
beg	1
a	1
boon	1
of	1
him,	1
which	1
is	1
that	1
he	1
redress	1
a	1
wrong	1
or	1
injury	1
that	1
a	1
wicked	1
giant	1
has	1
done	1
her;	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
fame	1
as	1
a	1
good	1
knight	1
which	1
your	1
master	1
has	1
acquired	1
far	1
and	1
wide,	1
this	1
princess	1
has	1
come	1
from	1
Guinea	1
to	1
seek	1
him.”	1
“A	1
lucky	1
seeking	1
and	1
a	1
lucky	1
finding!”	1
said	1
Sancho	1
Panza	1
at	1
this;	1
“especially	1
if	1
my	1
master	1
has	1
the	1
good	1
fortune	1
to	1
redress	1
that	1
injury,	1
and	1
right	1
that	1
wrong,	1
and	1
kill	1
that	1
son	1
of	1
a	1
bitch	1
of	1
a	1
giant	1
your	1
worship	1
speaks	1
of;	1
as	1
kill	1
him	1
he	1
will	1
if	1
he	1
meets	1
him,	1
unless,	1
indeed,	1
he	1
happens	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
phantom;	1
for	1
my	1
master	1
has	1
no	1
power	1
at	1
all	1
against	1
phantoms.	1
But	1
one	1
thing	1
among	1
others	1
I	1
would	1
beg	1
of	1
you,	1
señor	1
licentiate,	1
which	1
is,	1
that,	1
to	1
prevent	1
my	1
master	1
taking	1
a	1
fancy	1
to	1
be	1
an	1
archbishop,	1
for	1
that	1
is	1
what	1
I’m	1
afraid	1
of,	1
your	1
worship	1
would	1
recommend	1
him	1
to	1
marry	1
this	1
princess	1
at	1
once;	1
for	1
in	1
this	1
way	1
he	1
will	1
be	1
disabled	1
from	1
taking	1
archbishop’s	1
orders,	1
and	1
will	1
easily	1
come	1
into	1
his	1
empire,	1
and	1
I	1
to	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
my	1
desires;	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
thinking	1
over	1
the	1
matter	1
carefully,	1
and	1
by	1
what	1
I	1
can	1
make	1
out	1
I	1
find	1
it	1
will	1
not	1
do	1
for	1
me	1
that	1
my	1
master	1
should	1
become	1
an	1
archbishop,	1
because	1
I	1
am	1
no	1
good	1
for	1
the	1
Church,	1
as	1
I	1
am	1
married;	1
and	1
for	1
me	1
now,	1
having	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
a	1
wife	1
and	1
children,	1
to	1
set	1
about	1
obtaining	1
dispensations	1
to	1
enable	1
me	1
to	1
hold	1
a	1
place	1
of	1
profit	1
under	1
the	1
Church,	1
would	1
be	1
endless	1
work;	1
so	1
that,	1
señor,	1
it	1
all	1
turns	1
on	1
my	1
master	1
marrying	1
this	1
lady	1
at	1
once—for	1
as	1
yet	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
her	1
grace,	1
and	1
so	1
I	1
cannot	1
call	1
her	1
by	1
her	1
name.”	1
“She	1
is	1
called	1
the	1
Princess	1
Micomicona,”	1
said	1
the	1
curate;	1
“for	1
as	1
her	1
kingdom	1
is	1
Micomicon,	1
it	1
is	1
clear	1
that	1
must	1
be	1
her	1
name.”	1
“There’s	1
no	1
doubt	1
of	1
that,”	1
replied	1
Sancho,	1
“for	1
I	1
have	1
known	1
many	1
to	1
take	1
their	1
name	1
and	1
title	1
from	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
they	1
were	1
born	1
and	1
call	1
themselves	1
Pedro	1
of	1
Alcalá,	1
Juan	1
of	1
Úbeda,	1
and	1
Diego	1
of	1
Valladolid;	1
and	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
that	1
over	1
there	1
in	1
Guinea	1
queens	1
have	1
the	1
same	1
way	1
of	1
taking	1
the	1
names	1
of	1
their	1
kingdoms.”	1
“So	1
it	1
may,”	1
said	1
the	1
curate;	1
“and	1
as	1
for	1
your	1
master’s	1
marrying,	1
I	1
will	1
do	1
all	1
in	1
my	1
power	1
towards	1
it:”	1
with	1
which	1
Sancho	1
was	1
as	1
much	1
pleased	1
as	1
the	1
curate	1
was	1
amazed	1
at	1
his	1
simplicity	1
and	1
at	1
seeing	1
what	1
a	1
hold	1
the	1
absurdities	1
of	1
his	1
master	1
had	1
taken	1
of	1
his	1
fancy,	1
for	1
he	1
had	1
evidently	1
persuaded	1
himself	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
going	1
to	1
be	1
an	1
emperor.	1
By	1
this	1
time	1
Dorothea	1
had	1
seated	1
herself	1
upon	1
the	1
curate’s	1
mule,	1
and	1
the	1
barber	1
had	1
fitted	1
the	1
ox-tail	1
beard	1
to	1
his	1
face,	1
and	1
they	1
now	1
told	1
Sancho	1
to	1
conduct	1
them	1
to	1
where	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
was,	1
warning	1
him	1
not	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
he	1
knew	1
either	1
the	1
licentiate	1
or	1
the	1
barber,	1
as	1
his	1
master’s	1
becoming	1
an	1
emperor	1
entirely	1
depended	1
on	1
his	1
not	1
recognising	1
them;	1
neither	1
the	1
curate	1
nor	1
Cardenio,	1
however,	1
thought	1
fit	1
to	1
go	1
with	1
them;	1
Cardenio	1
lest	1
he	1
should	1
remind	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
of	1
the	1
quarrel	1
he	1
had	1
with	1
him,	1
and	1
the	1
curate	1
as	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
necessity	1
for	1
his	1
presence	1
just	1
yet,	1
so	1
they	1
allowed	1
the	1
others	1
to	1
go	1
on	1
before	1
them,	1
while	1
they	1
themselves	1
followed	1
slowly	1
on	1
foot.	1
The	1
curate	1
did	1
not	1
forget	1
to	1
instruct	1
Dorothea	1
how	1
to	1
act,	1
but	1
she	1
said	1
they	1
might	1
make	1
their	1
minds	1
easy,	1
as	1
everything	1
would	1
be	1
done	1
exactly	1
as	1
the	1
books	1
of	1
chivalry	1
required	1
and	1
described.	1

They	1
had	1
gone	1
about	1
three-quarters	1
of	1
a	1
league	1
when	1
they	1
discovered	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
in	1
a	1
wilderness	1
of	1
rocks,	1
by	1
this	1
time	1
clothed,	1
but	1
without	1
his	1
armour;	1
and	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
Dorothea	1
saw	1
him	1
and	1
was	1
told	1
by	1
Sancho	1
that	1
that	1
was	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
she	1
whipped	1
her	1
palfrey,	1
the	1
well-bearded	1
barber	1
following	1
her,	1
and	1
on	1
coming	1
up	1
to	1
him	1
her	1
squire	1
sprang	1
from	1
his	1
mule	1
and	1
came	1
forward	1
to	1
receive	1
her	1
in	1
his	1
arms,	1
and	1
she	1
dismounting	1
with	1
great	1
ease	1
of	1
manner	1
advanced	1
to	1
kneel	1
before	1
the	1
feet	1
of	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
and	1
though	1
he	1
strove	1
to	1
raise	1
her	1
up,	1
she	1
without	1
rising	1
addressed	1
him	1
in	1
this	1
fashion:	1
“From	1
this	1
spot	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
rise,	1
valiant	1
and	1
doughty	1
knight,	1
until	1
your	1
goodness	1
and	1
courtesy	1
grant	1
me	1
a	1
boon,	1
which	1
will	1
redound	1
to	1
the	1
honour	1
and	1
renown	1
of	1
your	1
person	1
and	1
render	1
a	1
service	1
to	1
the	1
most	1
disconsolate	1
and	1
afflicted	1
damsel	1
the	1
sun	1
has	1
seen;	1
and	1
if	1
the	1
might	1
of	1
your	1
strong	1
arm	1
corresponds	1
to	1
the	1
repute	1
of	1
your	1
immortal	1
fame,	1
you	1
are	1
bound	1
to	1
aid	1
the	1
helpless	1
being	1
who,	1
led	1
by	1
the	1
savour	1
of	1
your	1
renowned	1
name,	1
hath	1
come	1
from	1
far	1
distant	1
lands	1
to	1
seek	1
your	1
aid	1
in	1
her	1
misfortunes.”	1
“I	1
will	1
not	1
answer	1
a	1
word,	1
beauteous	1
lady,”	1
replied	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“nor	1
will	1
I	1
listen	1
to	1
anything	1
further	1
concerning	1
you,	1
until	1
you	1
rise	1
from	1
the	1
earth.”	1
“I	1
will	1
not	1
rise,	1
señor,”	1
answered	1
the	1
afflicted	1
damsel,	1
“unless	1
of	1
your	1
courtesy	1
the	1
boon	1
I	1
ask	1
is	1
first	1
granted	1
me.”	1
“I	1
grant	1
and	1
accord	1
it,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“provided	1
without	1
detriment	1
or	1
prejudice	1
to	1
my	1
king,	1
my	1
country,	1
or	1
her	1
who	1
holds	1
the	1
key	1
of	1
my	1
heart	1
and	1
freedom,	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
complied	1
with.”	1
“It	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
to	1
the	1
detriment	1
or	1
prejudice	1
of	1
any	1
of	1
them,	1
my	1
worthy	1
lord,”	1
said	1
the	1
afflicted	1
damsel;	1
and	1
here	1
Sancho	1
Panza	1
drew	1
close	1
to	1
his	1
master’s	1
ear	1
and	1
said	1
to	1
him	1
very	1
softly,	1
“Your	1
worship	1
may	1
very	1
safely	1
grant	1
the	1
boon	1
she	1
asks;	1
it’s	1
nothing	1
at	1
all;	1
only	1
to	1
kill	1
a	1
big	1
giant;	1
and	1
she	1
who	1
asks	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
exalted	1
Princess	1
Micomicona,	1
queen	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
kingdom	1
of	1
Micomicon	1
of	1
Ethiopia.”	1
“Let	1
her	1
be	1
who	1
she	1
may,”	1
replied	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“I	1
will	1
do	1
what	1
is	1
my	1
bounden	1
duty,	1
and	1
what	1
my	1
conscience	1
bids	1
me,	1
in	1
conformity	1
with	1
what	1
I	1
have	1
professed;”	1
and	1
turning	1
to	1
the	1
damsel	1
he	1
said,	1
“Let	1
your	1
great	1
beauty	1
rise,	1
for	1
I	1
grant	1
the	1
boon	1
which	1
you	1
would	1
ask	1
of	1
me.”	1
“Then	1
what	1
I	1
ask,”	1
said	1
the	1
damsel,	1
“is	1
that	1
your	1
magnanimous	1
person	1
accompany	1
me	1
at	1
once	1
whither	1
I	1
will	1
conduct	1
you,	1
and	1
that	1
you	1
promise	1
not	1
to	1
engage	1
in	1
any	1
other	1
adventure	1
or	1
quest	1
until	1
you	1
have	1
avenged	1
me	1
of	1
a	1
traitor	1
who	1
against	1
all	1
human	1
and	1
divine	1
law,	1
has	1
usurped	1
my	1
kingdom.”	1
“I	1
repeat	1
that	1
I	1
grant	1
it,”	1
replied	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
“and	1
so,	1
lady,	1
you	1
may	1
from	1
this	1
day	1
forth	1
lay	1
aside	1
the	1
melancholy	1
that	1
distresses	1
you,	1
and	1
let	1
your	1
failing	1
hopes	1
gather	1
new	1
life	1
and	1
strength,	1
for	1
with	1
the	1
help	1
of	1
God	1
and	1
of	1
my	1
arm	1
you	1
will	1
soon	1
see	1
yourself	1
restored	1
to	1
your	1
kingdom,	1
and	1
seated	1
upon	1
the	1
throne	1
of	1
your	1
ancient	1
and	1
mighty	1
realm,	1
notwithstanding	1
and	1
despite	1
of	1
the	1
felons	1
who	1
would	1
gainsay	1
it;	1
and	1
now	1
hands	1
to	1
the	1
work,	1
for	1
in	1
delay	1
there	1
is	1
apt	1
to	1
be	1
danger.”	1
The	1
distressed	1
damsel	1
strove	1
with	1
much	1
pertinacity	1
to	1
kiss	1
his	1
hands;	1
but	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
who	1
was	1
in	1
all	1
things	1
a	1
polished	1
and	1
courteous	1
knight,	1
would	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
allow	1
it,	1
but	1
made	1
her	1
rise	1
and	1
embraced	1
her	1
with	1
great	1
courtesy	1
and	1
politeness,	1
and	1
ordered	1
Sancho	1
to	1
look	1
to	1
Rocinante’s	1
girths,	1
and	1
to	1
arm	1
him	1
without	1
a	1
moment’s	1
delay.	1
Sancho	1
took	1
down	1
the	1
armour,	1
which	1
was	1
hung	1
up	1
on	1
a	1
tree	1
like	1
a	1
trophy,	1
and	1
having	1
seen	1
to	1
the	1
girths	1
armed	1
his	1
master	1
in	1
a	1
trice,	1
who	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
found	1
himself	1
in	1
his	1
armour	1
exclaimed:	1
“Let	1
us	1
be	1
gone	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
God	1
to	1
bring	1
aid	1
to	1
this	1
great	1
lady.”	1
The	1
barber	1
was	1
all	1
this	1
time	1
on	1
his	1
knees	1
at	1
great	1
pains	1
to	1
hide	1
his	1
laughter	1
and	1
not	1
let	1
his	1
beard	1
fall,	1
for	1
had	1
it	1
fallen	1
maybe	1
their	1
fine	1
scheme	1
would	1
have	1
come	1
to	1
nothing;	1
but	1
now	1
seeing	1
the	1
boon	1
granted,	1
and	1
the	1
promptitude	1
with	1
which	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
prepared	1
to	1
set	1
out	1
in	1
compliance	1
with	1
it,	1
he	1
rose	1
and	1
took	1
his	1
lady’s	1
hand,	1
and	1
between	1
them	1
they	1
placed	1
her	1
upon	1
the	1
mule.	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
then	1
mounted	1
Rocinante,	1
and	1
the	1
barber	1
settled	1
himself	1
on	1
his	1
beast,	1
Sancho	1
being	1
left	1
to	1
go	1
on	1
foot,	1
which	1
made	1
him	1
feel	1
anew	1
the	1
loss	1
of	1
his	1
Dapple,	1
finding	1
the	1
want	1
of	1
him	1
now.	1
But	1
he	1
bore	1
all	1
with	1
cheerfulness,	1
being	1
persuaded	1
that	1
his	1
master	1
had	1
now	1
fairly	1
started	1
and	1
was	1
just	1
on	1
the	1
point	1
of	1
becoming	1
an	1
emperor;	1
for	1
he	1
felt	1
no	1
doubt	1
at	1
all	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
marry	1
this	1
princess,	1
and	1
be	1
king	1
of	1
Micomicon	1
at	1
least.	1
The	1
only	1
thing	1
that	1
troubled	1
him	1
was	1
the	1
reflection	1
that	1
this	1
kingdom	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
the	1
blacks,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
people	1
they	1
would	1
give	1
him	1
for	1
vassals	1
would	1
be	1
all	1
black;	1
but	1
for	1
this	1
he	1
soon	1
found	1
a	1
remedy	1
in	1
his	1
fancy,	1
and	1
said	1
he	1
to	1
himself,	1
“What	1
is	1
it	1
to	1
me	1
if	1
my	1
vassals	1
are	1
blacks?	1
What	1
more	1
have	1
I	1
to	1
do	1
than	1
make	1
a	1
cargo	1
of	1
them	1
and	1
carry	1
them	1
to	1
Spain,	1
where	1
I	1
can	1
sell	1
them	1
and	1
get	1
ready	1
money	1
for	1
them,	1
and	1
with	1
it	1
buy	1
some	1
title	1
or	1
some	1
office	1
in	1
which	1
to	1
live	1
at	1
ease	1
all	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
my	1
life?	1
Not	1
unless	1
you	1
go	1
to	1
sleep	1
and	1
haven’t	1
the	1
wit	1
or	1
skill	1
to	1
turn	1
things	1
to	1
account	1
and	1
sell	1
three,	1
six,	1
or	1
ten	1
thousand	1
vassals	1
while	1
you	1
would	1
be	1
talking	1
about	1
it!	1
By	1
God	1
I	1
will	1
stir	1
them	1
up,	1
big	1
and	1
little,	1
or	1
as	1
best	1
I	1
can,	1
and	1
let	1
them	1
be	1
ever	1
so	1
black	1
I’ll	1
turn	1
them	1
into	1
white	1
or	1
yellow.	1
Come,	1
come,	1
what	1
a	1
fool	1
I	1
am!”	1
And	1
so	1
he	1
jogged	1
on,	1
so	1
occupied	1
with	1
his	1
thoughts	1
and	1
easy	1
in	1
his	1
mind	1
that	1
he	1
forgot	1
all	1
about	1
the	1
hardship	1
of	1
travelling	1
on	1
foot.	1
Cardenio	1
and	1
the	1
curate	1
were	1
watching	1
all	1
this	1
from	1
among	1
some	1
bushes,	1
not	1
knowing	1
how	1
to	1
join	1
company	1
with	1
the	1
others;	1
but	1
the	1
curate,	1
who	1
was	1
very	1
fertile	1
in	1
devices,	1
soon	1
hit	1
upon	1
a	1
way	1
of	1
effecting	1
their	1
purpose,	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
pair	1
of	1
scissors	1
he	1
had	1
in	1
a	1
case	1
he	1
quickly	1
cut	1
off	1
Cardenio’s	1
beard,	1
and	1
putting	1
on	1
him	1
a	1
grey	1
jerkin	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
he	1
gave	1
him	1
a	1
black	1
cloak,	1
leaving	1
himself	1
in	1
his	1
breeches	1
and	1
doublet,	1
while	1
Cardenio’s	1
appearance	1
was	1
so	1
different	1
from	1
what	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
known	1
himself	1
had	1
he	1
seen	1
himself	1
in	1
a	1
mirror.	1
Having	1
effected	1
this,	1
although	1
the	1
others	1
had	1
gone	1
on	1
ahead	1
while	1
they	1
were	1
disguising	1
themselves,	1
they	1
easily	1
came	1
out	1
on	1
the	1
high	1
road	1
before	1
them,	1
for	1
the	1
brambles	1
and	1
awkward	1
places	1
they	1
encountered	1
did	1
not	1
allow	1
those	1
on	1
horseback	1
to	1
go	1
as	1
fast	1
as	1
those	1
on	1
foot.	1
They	1
then	1
posted	1
themselves	1
on	1
the	1
level	1
ground	1
at	1
the	1
outlet	1
of	1
the	1
Sierra,	1
and	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
and	1
his	1
companions	1
emerged	1
from	1
it	1
the	1
curate	1
began	1
to	1
examine	1
him	1
very	1
deliberately,	1
as	1
though	1
he	1
were	1
striving	1
to	1
recognise	1
him,	1
and	1
after	1
having	1
stared	1
at	1
him	1
for	1
some	1
time	1
he	1
hastened	1
towards	1
him	1
with	1
open	1
arms	1
exclaiming,	1
“A	1
happy	1
meeting	1
with	1
the	1
mirror	1
of	1
chivalry,	1
my	1
worthy	1
compatriot	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
of	1
La	1
Mancha,	1
the	1
flower	1
and	1
cream	1
of	1
high	1
breeding,	1
the	1
protection	1
and	1
relief	1
of	1
the	1
distressed,	1
the	1
quintessence	1
of	1
knights-errant!”	1
And	1
so	1
saying	1
he	1
clasped	1
in	1
his	1
arms	1
the	1
knee	1
of	1
Don	1
Quixote’s	1
left	1
leg.	1
He,	1
astonished	1
at	1
the	1
stranger’s	1
words	1
and	1
behaviour,	1
looked	1
at	1
him	1
attentively,	1
and	1
at	1
length	1
recognised	1
him,	1
very	1
much	1
surprised	1
to	1
see	1
him	1
there,	1
and	1
made	1
great	1
efforts	1
to	1
dismount.	1
This,	1
however,	1
the	1
curate	1
would	1
not	1
allow,	1
on	1
which	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
said,	1
“Permit	1
me,	1
señor	1
licentiate,	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
fitting	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
on	1
horseback	1
and	1
so	1
reverend	1
a	1
person	1
as	1
your	1
worship	1
on	1
foot.”	1
“On	1
no	1
account	1
will	1
I	1
allow	1
it,”	1
said	1
the	1
curate;	1
“your	1
mightiness	1
must	1
remain	1
on	1
horseback,	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
on	1
horseback	1
you	1
achieve	1
the	1
greatest	1
deeds	1
and	1
adventures	1
that	1
have	1
been	1
beheld	1
in	1
our	1
age;	1
as	1
for	1
me,	1
an	1
unworthy	1
priest,	1
it	1
will	1
serve	1
me	1
well	1
enough	1
to	1
mount	1
on	1
the	1
haunches	1
of	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
mules	1
of	1
these	1
gentlefolk	1
who	1
accompany	1
your	1
worship,	1
if	1
they	1
have	1
no	1
objection,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
fancy	1
I	1
am	1
mounted	1
on	1
the	1
steed	1
Pegasus,	1
or	1
on	1
the	1
zebra	1
or	1
charger	1
that	1
bore	1
the	1
famous	1
Moor,	1
Muzaraque,	1
who	1
to	1
this	1
day	1
lies	1
enchanted	1
in	1
the	1
great	1
hill	1
of	1
Zulema,	1
a	1
little	1
distance	1
from	1
the	1
great	1
Complutum.”	1
“Nor	1
even	1
that	1
will	1
I	1
consent	1
to,	1
señor	1
licentiate,”	1
answered	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“and	1
I	1
know	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
the	1
good	1
pleasure	1
of	1
my	1
lady	1
the	1
princess,	1
out	1
of	1
love	1
for	1
me,	1
to	1
order	1
her	1
squire	1
to	1
give	1
up	1
the	1
saddle	1
of	1
his	1
mule	1
to	1
your	1
worship,	1
and	1
he	1
can	1
sit	1
behind	1
if	1
the	1
beast	1
will	1
bear	1
it.”	1
“It	1
will,	1
I	1
am	1
sure,”	1
said	1
the	1
princess,	1
“and	1
I	1
am	1
sure,	1
too,	1
that	1
I	1
need	1
not	1
order	1
my	1
squire,	1
for	1
he	1
is	1
too	1
courteous	1
and	1
considerate	1
to	1
allow	1
a	1
Churchman	1
to	1
go	1
on	1
foot	1
when	1
he	1
might	1
be	1
mounted.”	1
“That	1
he	1
is,”	1
said	1
the	1
barber,	1
and	1
at	1
once	1
alighting,	1
he	1
offered	1
his	1
saddle	1
to	1
the	1
curate,	1
who	1
accepted	1
it	1
without	1
much	1
entreaty;	1
but	1
unfortunately	1
as	1
the	1
barber	1
was	1
mounting	1
behind,	1
the	1
mule,	1
being	1
as	1
it	1
happened	1
a	1
hired	1
one,	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
same	1
thing	1
as	1
saying	1
ill-conditioned,	1
lifted	1
its	1
hind	1
hoofs	1
and	1
let	1
fly	1
a	1
couple	1
of	1
kicks	1
in	1
the	1
air,	1
which	1
would	1
have	1
made	1
Master	1
Nicholas	1
wish	1
his	1
expedition	1
in	1
quest	1
of	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
at	1
the	1
devil	1
had	1
they	1
caught	1
him	1
on	1
the	1
breast	1
or	1
head.	1
As	1
it	1
was,	1
they	1
so	1
took	1
him	1
by	1
surprise	1
that	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
ground,	1
giving	1
so	1
little	1
heed	1
to	1
his	1
beard	1
that	1
it	1
fell	1
off,	1
and	1
all	1
he	1
could	1
do	1
when	1
he	1
found	1
himself	1
without	1
it	1
was	1
to	1
cover	1
his	1
face	1
hastily	1
with	1
both	1
his	1
hands	1
and	1
moan	1
that	1
his	1
teeth	1
were	1
knocked	1
out.	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
all	1
that	1
bundle	1
of	1
beard	1
detached,	1
without	1
jaws	1
or	1
blood,	1
from	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
fallen	1
squire,	1
exclaimed:	1
“By	1
the	1
living	1
God,	1
but	1
this	1
is	1
a	1
great	1
miracle!	1
it	1
has	1
knocked	1
off	1
and	1
plucked	1
away	1
the	1
beard	1
from	1
his	1
face	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
shaved	1
off	1
designedly.”	1
The	1
curate,	1
seeing	1
the	1
danger	1
of	1
discovery	1
that	1
threatened	1
his	1
scheme,	1
at	1
once	1
pounced	1
upon	1
the	1
beard	1
and	1
hastened	1
with	1
it	1
to	1
where	1
Master	1
Nicholas	1
lay,	1
still	1
uttering	1
moans,	1
and	1
drawing	1
his	1
head	1
to	1
his	1
breast	1
had	1
it	1
on	1
in	1
an	1
instant,	1
muttering	1
over	1
him	1
some	1
words	1
which	1
he	1
said	1
were	1
a	1
certain	1
special	1
charm	1
for	1
sticking	1
on	1
beards,	1
as	1
they	1
would	1
see;	1
and	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
it	1
fixed	1
he	1
left	1
him,	1
and	1
the	1
squire	1
appeared	1
well	1
bearded	1
and	1
whole	1
as	1
before,	1
whereat	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
was	1
beyond	1
measure	1
astonished,	1
and	1
begged	1
the	1
curate	1
to	1
teach	1
him	1
that	1
charm	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
an	1
opportunity,	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
persuaded	1
its	1
virtue	1
must	1
extend	1
beyond	1
the	1
sticking	1
on	1
of	1
beards,	1
for	1
it	1
was	1
clear	1
that	1
where	1
the	1
beard	1
had	1
been	1
stripped	1
off	1
the	1
flesh	1
must	1
have	1
remained	1
torn	1
and	1
lacerated,	1
and	1
when	1
it	1
could	1
heal	1
all	1
that	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
good	1
for	1
more	1
than	1
beards.	1
“And	1
so	1
it	1
is,”	1
said	1
the	1
curate,	1
and	1
he	1
promised	1
to	1
teach	1
it	1
to	1
him	1
on	1
the	1
first	1
opportunity.	1
They	1
then	1
agreed	1
that	1
for	1
the	1
present	1
the	1
curate	1
should	1
mount,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
three	1
should	1
ride	1
by	1
turns	1
until	1
they	1
reached	1
the	1
inn,	1
which	1
might	1
be	1
about	1
six	1
leagues	1
from	1
where	1
they	1
were.	1
Three	1
then	1
being	1
mounted,	1
that	1
is	1
to	1
say,	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
the	1
princess,	1
and	1
the	1
curate,	1
and	1
three	1
on	1
foot,	1
Cardenio,	1
the	1
barber,	1
and	1
Sancho	1
Panza,	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
damsel:	1
“Let	1
your	1
highness,	1
lady,	1
lead	1
on	1
whithersoever	1
is	1
most	1
pleasing	1
to	1
you;”	1
but	1
before	1
she	1
could	1
answer	1
the	1
licentiate	1
said:	1

“Towards	1
what	1
kingdom	1
would	1
your	1
ladyship	1
direct	1
our	1
course?	1
Is	1
it	1
perchance	1
towards	1
that	1
of	1
Micomicon?	1
It	1
must	1
be,	1
or	1
else	1
I	1
know	1
little	1
about	1
kingdoms.”	1
She,	1
being	1
ready	1
on	1
all	1
points,	1
understood	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
to	1
answer	1
“Yes,”	1
so	1
she	1
said	1
“Yes,	1
señor,	1
my	1
way	1
lies	1
towards	1
that	1
kingdom.”	1
“In	1
that	1
case,”	1
said	1
the	1
curate,	1
“we	1
must	1
pass	1
right	1
through	1
my	1
village,	1
and	1
there	1
your	1
worship	1
will	1
take	1
the	1
road	1
to	1
Cartagena,	1
where	1
you	1
will	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
embark,	1
fortune	1
favouring;	1
and	1
if	1
the	1
wind	1
be	1
fair	1
and	1
the	1
sea	1
smooth	1
and	1
tranquil,	1
in	1
somewhat	1
less	1
than	1
nine	1
years	1
you	1
may	1
come	1
in	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
lake	1
Meona,	1
I	1
mean	1
Meotides,	1
which	1

little	1
more	1
than	1
a	1
hundred	1

journey	1
this	1
side	1
of	1
your	1

“Your	1
worship	1
is	1
mistaken,	1
señor,”	1
said	1
she;	1
“for	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
two	1
years	1
since	1
I	1
set	1
out	1
from	1
it,	1
and	1
though	1
I	1
never	1
had	1
good	1
weather,	1
nevertheless	1
I	1
am	1
here	1
to	1
behold	1
what	1
I	1
so	1
longed	1
for,	1
and	1
that	1
is	1
my	1
lord	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
of	1
La	1
Mancha,	1
whose	1
fame	1
came	1
to	1
my	1
ears	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
I	1
set	1
foot	1
in	1
Spain	1
and	1
impelled	1
me	1
to	1
go	1
in	1
search	1
of	1
him,	1
to	1
commend	1
myself	1
to	1
his	1
courtesy,	1
and	1
entrust	1
the	1
justice	1
of	1
my	1
cause	1
to	1
the	1
might	1
of	1
his	1
invincible	1
arm.”	1
“Enough;	1
no	1
more	1
praise,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
at	1
this,	1
“for	1
I	1
hate	1
all	1
flattery;	1
and	1
though	1
this	1
may	1
not	1
be	1
so,	1
still	1
language	1
of	1
the	1
kind	1
is	1
offensive	1
to	1
my	1
chaste	1
ears.	1
I	1
will	1
only	1
say,	1
señora,	1
that	1
whether	1
it	1
has	1
might	1
or	1
not,	1
that	1
which	1
it	1
may	1
or	1
may	1
not	1
have	1
shall	1
be	1
devoted	1
to	1
your	1
service	1
even	1
to	1
death;	1
and	1
now,	1
leaving	1
this	1
to	1
its	1
proper	1
season,	1
I	1
would	1
ask	1
the	1
señor	1
licentiate	1
to	1
tell	1
me	1
what	1
it	1
is	1
that	1
has	1
brought	1
him	1
into	1
these	1
parts,	1
alone,	1
unattended,	1
and	1
so	1
lightly	1
clad	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
filled	1
with	1
amazement.”	1
“I	1
will	1
answer	1
that	1
briefly,”	1
replied	1
the	1
curate;	1
“you	1
must	1
know	1
then,	1
Señor	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
that	1
Master	1
Nicholas,	1
our	1
friend	1
and	1
barber,	1
and	1
I	1
were	1
going	1
to	1
Seville	1
to	1
receive	1
some	1
money	1
that	1
a	1
relative	1
of	1
mine	1
who	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
Indies	1
many	1
years	1
ago	1
had	1
sent	1
me,	1
and	1
not	1
such	1
a	1
small	1
sum	1
but	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
over	1
sixty	1
thousand	1
pieces	1
of	1
eight,	1
full	1
weight,	1
which	1
is	1
something;	1
and	1
passing	1
by	1
this	1
place	1
yesterday	1
we	1
were	1
attacked	1
by	1
four	1
footpads,	1
who	1
stripped	1
us	1
even	1
to	1
our	1
beards,	1
and	1
them	1
they	1
stripped	1
off	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
barber	1
found	1
it	1
necessary	1
to	1
put	1
on	1
a	1
false	1
one,	1
and	1
even	1
this	1
young	1
man	1
here”—pointing	1
to	1
Cardenio—“they	1
completely	1
transformed.	1
But	1
the	1
best	1
of	1
it	1
is,	1
the	1
story	1
goes	1
in	1
the	1
neighbourhood	1
that	1
those	1
who	1
attacked	1
us	1
belong	1
to	1
a	1
number	1
of	1
galley	1
slaves	1
who,	1
they	1
say,	1
were	1
set	1
free	1
almost	1
on	1
the	1
very	1
same	1
spot	1
by	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
such	1
valour	1
that,	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
the	1
commissary	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
guards,	1
he	1
released	1
the	1
whole	1
of	1
them;	1
and	1
beyond	1
all	1
doubt	1
he	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
senses,	1
or	1
he	1
must	1
be	1
as	1
great	1
a	1
scoundrel	1
as	1
they,	1
or	1
some	1
man	1
without	1
heart	1
or	1
conscience	1
to	1
let	1
the	1
wolf	1
loose	1
among	1
the	1
sheep,	1
the	1
fox	1
among	1
the	1
hens,	1
the	1
fly	1
among	1
the	1
honey.	1
He	1
has	1
defrauded	1
justice,	1
and	1
opposed	1
his	1
king	1
and	1
lawful	1
master,	1
for	1
he	1
opposed	1
his	1
just	1
commands;	1
he	1
has,	1
I	1
say,	1
robbed	1
the	1
galleys	1
of	1
their	1
feet,	1
stirred	1
up	1
the	1
Holy	1
Brotherhood	1
which	1
for	1
many	1
years	1
past	1
has	1
been	1
quiet,	1
and,	1
lastly,	1
has	1
done	1
a	1
deed	1
by	1
which	1
his	1
soul	1
may	1
be	1
lost	1
without	1
any	1
gain	1
to	1
his	1
body.”	1
Sancho	1
had	1
told	1
the	1
curate	1
and	1
the	1
barber	1
of	1
the	1
adventure	1
of	1
the	1
galley	1
slaves,	1
which,	1
so	1
much	1
to	1
his	1
glory,	1
his	1
master	1
had	1
achieved,	1
and	1
hence	1
the	1
curate	1
in	1
alluding	1
to	1
it	1
made	1
the	1
most	1
of	1
it	1
to	1
see	1
what	1
would	1
be	1
said	1
or	1
done	1
by	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
who	1
changed	1
colour	1
at	1
every	1
word,	1
not	1
daring	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
he	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
the	1
liberator	1
of	1
those	1
worthy	1
people.	1
“These,	1
then,”	1
said	1
the	1
curate,	1
“were	1
they	1
who	1
robbed	1
us;	1
and	1
God	1
in	1
his	1
mercy	1
pardon	1
him	1
who	1
would	1
not	1
let	1
them	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
punishment	1
they	1
deserved.”	1

The	1
curate	1
had	1
hardly	1
ceased	1
speaking,	1
when	1
Sancho	1
said,	1
“In	1
faith,	1
then,	1
señor	1
licentiate,	1
he	1
who	1
did	1
that	1
deed	1
was	1
my	1
master;	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
for	1
want	1
of	1
my	1
telling	1
him	1
beforehand	1
and	1
warning	1
him	1
to	1
mind	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
about,	1
and	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
sin	1
to	1
set	1
them	1
at	1
liberty,	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
on	1
the	1
march	1
there	1
because	1
they	1
were	1
special	1
scoundrels.”	1
“Blockhead!”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
at	1
this,	1
“it	1
is	1
no	1
business	1
or	1
concern	1
of	1
knights-errant	1
to	1
inquire	1
whether	1
any	1
persons	1
in	1
affliction,	1
in	1
chains,	1
or	1
oppressed	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
meet	1
on	1
the	1
high	1
roads	1
go	1
that	1
way	1
and	1
suffer	1
as	1
they	1
do	1
because	1
of	1
their	1
faults	1
or	1
because	1
of	1
their	1
misfortunes.	1
It	1
only	1
concerns	1
them	1
to	1
aid	1
them	1
as	1
persons	1
in	1
need	1
of	1
help,	1
having	1
regard	1
to	1
their	1
sufferings	1
and	1
not	1
to	1
their	1
rascalities.	1
I	1
encountered	1
a	1
chaplet	1
or	1
string	1
of	1
miserable	1
and	1
unfortunate	1
people,	1
and	1
did	1
for	1
them	1
what	1
my	1
sense	1
of	1
duty	1
demands	1
of	1
me,	1
and	1
as	1
for	1
the	1
rest	1
be	1
that	1
as	1
it	1
may;	1
and	1
whoever	1
takes	1
objection	1
to	1
it,	1
saving	1
the	1
sacred	1
dignity	1
of	1
the	1
señor	1
licentiate	1
and	1
his	1
honoured	1
person,	1
I	1
say	1
he	1
knows	1
little	1
about	1
chivalry	1
and	1
lies	1
like	1
a	1
whoreson	1
villain,	1
and	1
this	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
him	1
to	1
know	1
to	1
the	1
fullest	1
extent	1
with	1
my	1
sword;”	1
and	1
so	1
saying	1
he	1
settled	1
himself	1
in	1
his	1
stirrups	1
and	1
pressed	1
down	1
his	1
morion;	1
for	1
the	1
barber’s	1
basin,	1
which	1
according	1
to	1
him	1
was	1
Mambrino’s	1
helmet,	1
he	1
carried	1
hanging	1
at	1
the	1
saddle-bow	1
until	1
he	1
could	1
repair	1
the	1
damage	1
done	1
to	1
it	1
by	1
the	1
galley	1
slaves.	1
Dorothea,	1
who	1
was	1
shrewd	1
and	1
sprightly,	1
and	1
by	1
this	1
time	1
thoroughly	1
understood	1
Don	1
Quixote’s	1
crazy	1
turn,	1
and	1
that	1
all	1
except	1
Sancho	1
Panza	1
were	1
making	1
game	1
of	1
him,	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
behind	1
the	1
rest	1
said	1
to	1
him,	1
on	1
observing	1
his	1
irritation,	1
“Sir	1
Knight,	1
remember	1
the	1
boon	1
you	1
have	1
promised	1
me,	1
and	1
that	1
in	1
accordance	1
with	1
it	1
you	1
must	1
not	1
engage	1
in	1
any	1
other	1
adventure,	1
be	1
it	1
ever	1
so	1
pressing;	1
calm	1
yourself,	1
for	1
if	1
the	1
licentiate	1
had	1
known	1
that	1
the	1
galley	1
slaves	1
had	1
been	1
set	1
free	1
by	1
that	1
unconquered	1
arm	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
stopped	1
his	1
mouth	1
thrice	1
over,	1
or	1
even	1
bitten	1
his	1
tongue	1
three	1
times	1
before	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
said	1
a	1
word	1
that	1
tended	1
towards	1
disrespect	1
of	1
your	1
worship.”	1
“That	1
I	1
swear	1
heartily,”	1
said	1
the	1
curate,	1
“and	1
I	1
would	1
have	1
even	1
plucked	1
off	1
a	1
moustache.”	1
“I	1
will	1
hold	1
my	1
peace,	1
señora,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“and	1
I	1
will	1
curb	1
the	1
natural	1
anger	1
that	1
had	1
arisen	1
in	1
my	1
breast,	1
and	1
will	1
proceed	1
in	1
peace	1
and	1
quietness	1
until	1
I	1
have	1
fulfilled	1
my	1
promise;	1
but	1
in	1
return	1
for	1
this	1
consideration	1
I	1
entreat	1
you	1
to	1
tell	1
me,	1
if	1
you	1
have	1
no	1
objection	1
to	1
do	1
so,	1
what	1
is	1
the	1
nature	1
of	1
your	1
trouble,	1
and	1
how	1
many,	1
who,	1
and	1
what	1
are	1
the	1
persons	1
of	1
whom	1
I	1
am	1
to	1
require	1
due	1
satisfaction,	1
and	1
on	1
whom	1
I	1
am	1
to	1
take	1
vengeance	1
on	1
your	1
behalf?”	1
“That	1
I	1
will	1
do	1
with	1
all	1
my	1
heart,”	1
replied	1
Dorothea,	1
“if	1
it	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
wearisome	1
to	1
you	1
to	1
hear	1
of	1
miseries	1
and	1
misfortunes.”	1
“It	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
wearisome,	1
señora,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
to	1
which	1
Dorothea	1
replied,	1
“Well,	1
if	1
that	1
be	1
so,	1
give	1
me	1
your	1
attention.”	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
she	1
said	1
this,	1
Cardenio	1
and	1
the	1
barber	1
drew	1
close	1
to	1
her	1
side,	1
eager	1
to	1
hear	1
what	1
sort	1
of	1
story	1
the	1
quick-witted	1
Dorothea	1
would	1
invent	1
for	1
herself;	1
and	1
Sancho	1
did	1
the	1
same,	1
for	1
he	1
was	1
as	1
much	1
taken	1
in	1
by	1
her	1
as	1
his	1
master;	1
and	1
she	1
having	1
settled	1
herself	1
comfortably	1
in	1
the	1
saddle,	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
help	1
of	1
coughing	1
and	1
other	1
preliminaries	1
taken	1
time	1
to	1
think,	1
began	1
with	1
great	1
sprightliness	1
of	1
manner	1
in	1
this	1
fashion.	1
“First	1
of	1
all,	1
I	1
would	1
have	1
you	1
know,	1
sirs,	1
that	1
my	1
name	1
is—”	1
and	1
here	1
she	1
stopped	1
for	1
a	1
moment,	1
for	1
she	1
forgot	1
the	1
name	1
the	1
curate	1
had	1
given	1
her;	1
but	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
her	1
relief,	1
seeing	1
what	1
her	1
difficulty	1
was,	1
and	1
said,	1
“It	1
is	1
no	1
wonder,	1
señora,	1
that	1
your	1
highness	1
should	1
be	1
confused	1
and	1
embarrassed	1
in	1
telling	1
the	1
tale	1
of	1
your	1
misfortunes;	1
for	1
such	1
afflictions	1
often	1
have	1
the	1
effect	1
of	1
depriving	1
the	1
sufferers	1
of	1
memory,	1
so	1
that	1
they	1
do	1
not	1
even	1
remember	1
their	1
own	1
names,	1
as	1
is	1
the	1
case	1
now	1
with	1
your	1
ladyship,	1
who	1
has	1
forgotten	1
that	1
she	1
is	1
called	1
the	1
Princess	1
Micomicona,	1
lawful	1
heiress	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
kingdom	1
of	1
Micomicon;	1
and	1
with	1
this	1
cue	1
your	1
highness	1
may	1
now	1
recall	1
to	1
your	1
sorrowful	1
recollection	1
all	1
you	1
may	1
wish	1
to	1
tell	1
us.”	1
“That	1
is	1
the	1
truth,”	1
said	1
the	1
damsel;	1
“but	1
I	1
think	1
from	1
this	1
on	1
I	1
shall	1
have	1
no	1
need	1
of	1
any	1
prompting,	1
and	1
I	1
shall	1
bring	1
my	1
true	1
story	1
safe	1
into	1
port,	1
and	1
here	1
it	1
is.	1
The	1
king	1
my	1
father,	1
who	1
was	1
called	1
Tinacrio	1
the	1
Sapient,	1
was	1
very	1
learned	1
in	1
what	1
they	1
call	1
magic	1
arts,	1
and	1
became	1
aware	1
by	1
his	1
craft	1
that	1
my	1
mother,	1
who	1
was	1
called	1
Queen	1
Jaramilla,	1
was	1
to	1
die	1
before	1
he	1
did,	1
and	1
that	1
soon	1
after	1
he	1
too	1
was	1
to	1
depart	1
this	1
life,	1
and	1
I	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
left	1
an	1
orphan	1
without	1
father	1
or	1
mother.	1
But	1
all	1
this,	1
he	1
declared,	1
did	1
not	1
so	1
much	1
grieve	1
or	1
distress	1
him	1
as	1
his	1
certain	1
knowledge	1
that	1
a	1
prodigious	1
giant,	1
the	1
lord	1
of	1
a	1
great	1
island	1
close	1
to	1
our	1
kingdom,	1
Pandafilando	1
of	1
the	1
Scowl	1
by	1
name—for	1
it	1
is	1
averred	1
that,	1
though	1
his	1
eyes	1
are	1
properly	1
placed	1
and	1
straight,	1
he	1
always	1
looks	1
askew	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
squinted,	1
and	1
this	1
he	1
does	1
out	1
of	1
malignity,	1
to	1
strike	1
fear	1
and	1
terror	1
into	1
those	1
he	1
looks	1
at—that	1
he	1
knew,	1
I	1
say,	1
that	1
this	1
giant	1
on	1
becoming	1
aware	1
of	1
my	1
orphan	1
condition	1
would	1
overrun	1
my	1
kingdom	1
with	1
a	1
mighty	1
force	1
and	1
strip	1
me	1
of	1
all,	1
not	1
leaving	1
me	1
even	1
a	1
small	1
village	1
to	1
shelter	1
me;	1
but	1
that	1
I	1
could	1
avoid	1
all	1
this	1
ruin	1
and	1
misfortune	1
if	1
I	1
were	1
willing	1
to	1
marry	1
him;	1
however,	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
he	1
could	1
see,	1
he	1
never	1
expected	1
that	1
I	1
would	1
consent	1
to	1
a	1
marriage	1
so	1
unequal;	1
and	1
he	1
said	1
no	1
more	1
than	1
the	1
truth	1
in	1
this,	1
for	1
it	1
has	1
never	1
entered	1
my	1
mind	1
to	1
marry	1
that	1
giant,	1
or	1
any	1
other,	1
let	1
him	1
be	1
ever	1
so	1
great	1
or	1
enormous.	1
My	1
father	1
said,	1
too,	1
that	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
dead,	1
and	1
I	1
saw	1
Pandafilando	1
about	1
to	1
invade	1
my	1
kingdom,	1
I	1
was	1
not	1
to	1
wait	1
and	1
attempt	1
to	1
defend	1
myself,	1
for	1
that	1
would	1
be	1
destructive	1
to	1
me,	1
but	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
leave	1
the	1
kingdom	1
entirely	1
open	1
to	1
him	1
if	1
I	1
wished	1
to	1
avoid	1
the	1
death	1
and	1
total	1
destruction	1
of	1
my	1
good	1
and	1
loyal	1
vassals,	1
for	1
there	1
would	1
be	1
no	1
possibility	1
of	1
defending	1
myself	1
against	1
the	1
giant’s	1
devilish	1
power;	1
and	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
at	1
once	1
with	1
some	1
of	1
my	1
followers	1
set	1
out	1
for	1
Spain,	1
where	1
I	1
should	1
obtain	1
relief	1
in	1
my	1
distress	1
on	1
finding	1
a	1
certain	1
knight-errant	1
whose	1
fame	1
by	1
that	1
time	1
would	1
extend	1
over	1
the	1
whole	1
kingdom,	1
and	1
who	1
would	1
be	1
called,	1
if	1
I	1
remember	1
rightly,	1
Don	1
Azote	1
or	1
Don	1
Gigote.”	1
“‘Don	1
Quixote,’	1
he	1
must	1
have	1
said,	1
señora,”	1
observed	1
Sancho	1
at	1
this,	1
“otherwise	1
called	1
the	1
Knight	1
of	1
the	1
Rueful	1
Countenance.”	1
“That	1
is	1
it,”	1
said	1
Dorothea;	1
“he	1
said,	1
moreover,	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
be	1
tall	1
of	1
stature	1
and	1
lank	1
featured;	1
and	1
that	1
on	1
his	1
right	1
side	1
under	1
the	1
left	1
shoulder,	1
or	1
thereabouts,	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
a	1
grey	1
mole	1
with	1
hairs	1
like	1
bristles.”	1
On	1
hearing	1
this,	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
said	1
to	1
his	1
squire,	1
“Here,	1
Sancho	1
my	1
son,	1
bear	1
a	1
hand	1
and	1
help	1
me	1
to	1
strip,	1
for	1
I	1
want	1
to	1
see	1
if	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
knight	1
that	1
sage	1
king	1
foretold.”	1
“What	1
does	1
your	1
worship	1
want	1
to	1
strip	1
for?”	1
said	1
Dorothea.	1
“To	1
see	1
if	1
I	1
have	1
that	1
mole	1
your	1
father	1
spoke	1
of,”	1
answered	1
Don	1
Quixote.	1
“There	1
is	1
no	1
occasion	1
to	1
strip,”	1
said	1
Sancho;	1
“for	1
I	1
know	1
your	1
worship	1
has	1
just	1
such	1
a	1
mole	1
on	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
your	1
backbone,	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
mark	1
of	1
a	1
strong	1
man.”	1
“That	1
is	1
enough,”	1
said	1
Dorothea,	1
“for	1
with	1
friends	1
we	1
must	1
not	1
look	1
too	1
closely	1
into	1
trifles;	1
and	1
whether	1
it	1
be	1
on	1
the	1
shoulder	1
or	1
on	1
the	1
backbone	1
matters	1
little;	1
it	1
is	1
enough	1
if	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
mole,	1
be	1
it	1
where	1
it	1
may,	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
all	1
the	1
same	1
flesh;	1
no	1
doubt	1
my	1
good	1
father	1
hit	1
the	1
truth	1
in	1
every	1
particular,	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
made	1
a	1
lucky	1
hit	1
in	1
commending	1
myself	1
to	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
for	1
he	1
is	1
the	1
one	1
my	1
father	1
spoke	1
of,	1
as	1
the	1
features	1
of	1
his	1
countenance	1
correspond	1
with	1
those	1
assigned	1
to	1
this	1
knight	1
by	1
that	1
wide	1
fame	1
he	1
has	1
acquired	1
not	1
only	1
in	1
Spain	1
but	1
in	1
all	1
La	1
Mancha;	1
for	1
I	1
had	1
scarcely	1
landed	1
at	1
Osuna	1
when	1
I	1
heard	1
such	1
accounts	1
of	1
his	1
achievements,	1
that	1
at	1
once	1
my	1
heart	1
told	1
me	1
he	1
was	1
the	1
very	1
one	1
I	1
had	1
come	1
in	1
search	1
of.”	1
“But	1
how	1
did	1
you	1
land	1
at	1
Osuna,	1
señora,”	1
asked	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“when	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
seaport?”	1
But	1
before	1
Dorothea	1
could	1
reply	1
the	1
curate	1
anticipated	1
her,	1
saying,	1
“The	1
princess	1
meant	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
after	1
she	1
had	1
landed	1
at	1
Malaga	1
the	1
first	1
place	1
where	1
she	1
heard	1
of	1
your	1
worship	1
was	1
Osuna.”	1
“That	1
is	1
what	1
I	1
meant	1
to	1
say,”	1
said	1
Dorothea.	1
“And	1
that	1
would	1
be	1
only	1
natural,”	1
said	1
the	1
curate.	1
“Will	1
your	1
majesty	1
please	1
proceed?”	1
“There	1
is	1
no	1
more	1
to	1
add,”	1
said	1
Dorothea,	1
“save	1
that	1
in	1
finding	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
I	1
have	1
had	1
such	1
good	1
fortune,	1
that	1
I	1
already	1
reckon	1
and	1
regard	1
myself	1
queen	1
and	1
mistress	1
of	1
my	1
entire	1
dominions,	1
since	1
of	1
his	1
courtesy	1
and	1
magnanimity	1
he	1
has	1
granted	1
me	1
the	1
boon	1
of	1
accompanying	1
me	1
whithersoever	1
I	1
may	1
conduct	1
him,	1
which	1
will	1
be	1
only	1
to	1
bring	1
him	1
face	1
to	1
face	1
with	1
Pandafilando	1
of	1
the	1
Scowl,	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
slay	1
him	1
and	1
restore	1
to	1
me	1
what	1
has	1
been	1
unjustly	1
usurped	1
by	1
him:	1
for	1
all	1
this	1
must	1
come	1
to	1
pass	1
satisfactorily	1
since	1
my	1
good	1
father	1
Tinacrio	1
the	1
Sapient	1
foretold	1
it,	1
who	1
likewise	1
left	1
it	1
declared	1
in	1
writing	1
in	1
Chaldee	1
or	1
Greek	1
characters	1
(for	1
I	1
cannot	1
read	1
them),	1
that	1
if	1
this	1
predicted	1
knight,	1
after	1
having	1
cut	1
the	1
giant’s	1
throat,	1
should	1
be	1
disposed	1
to	1
marry	1
me	1
I	1
was	1
to	1
offer	1
myself	1
at	1
once	1
without	1
demur	1
as	1
his	1
lawful	1
wife,	1
and	1
yield	1
him	1
possession	1
of	1
my	1
kingdom	1
together	1
with	1
my	1
person.”	1
“What	1
thinkest	1
thou	1
now,	1
friend	1
Sancho?”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
at	1
this.	1
“Hearest	1
thou	1
that?	1
Did	1
I	1
not	1
tell	1
thee	1
so?	1
See	1
how	1
we	1
have	1
already	1
got	1
a	1
kingdom	1
to	1
govern	1
and	1
a	1
queen	1
to	1
marry!”	1
“On	1
my	1
oath	1
it	1
is	1
so,”	1
said	1
Sancho;	1
“and	1
foul	1
fortune	1
to	1
him	1
who	1
won’t	1
marry	1
after	1
slitting	1
Señor	1
Pandahilado’s	1
windpipe!	1
And	1
then,	1
how	1
illfavoured	1
the	1
queen	1
is!	1
I	1
wish	1
the	1
fleas	1
in	1
my	1
bed	1
were	1
that	1
sort!”	1
And	1
so	1
saying	1
he	1
cut	1
a	1
couple	1
of	1
capers	1
in	1
the	1
air	1
with	1
every	1
sign	1
of	1
extreme	1
satisfaction,	1
and	1
then	1
ran	1
to	1
seize	1
the	1
bridle	1
of	1
Dorothea’s	1
mule,	1
and	1
checking	1
it	1
fell	1
on	1
his	1
knees	1
before	1
her,	1
begging	1
her	1
to	1
give	1
him	1
her	1
hand	1
to	1
kiss	1
in	1
token	1
of	1
his	1
acknowledgment	1
of	1
her	1
as	1
his	1
queen	1
and	1
mistress.	1
Which	1
of	1
the	1
bystanders	1
could	1
have	1
helped	1
laughing	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
madness	1
of	1
the	1
master	1
and	1
the	1
simplicity	1
of	1
the	1
servant?	1
Dorothea	1
therefore	1
gave	1
her	1
hand,	1
and	1
promised	1
to	1
make	1
him	1
a	1
great	1
lord	1
in	1
her	1
kingdom,	1
when	1
Heaven	1
should	1
be	1
so	1
good	1
as	1
to	1
permit	1
her	1
to	1
recover	1
and	1
enjoy	1
it,	1
for	1
which	1
Sancho	1
returned	1
thanks	1
in	1
words	1
that	1
set	1
them	1
all	1
laughing	1
again.	1
“This,	1
sirs,”	1
continued	1
Dorothea,	1
“is	1
my	1
story;	1
it	1
only	1
remains	1
to	1
tell	1
you	1
that	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
attendants	1
I	1
took	1
with	1
me	1
from	1
my	1
kingdom	1
I	1
have	1
none	1
left	1
except	1
this	1
well-bearded	1
squire,	1
for	1
all	1
were	1
drowned	1
in	1
a	1
great	1
tempest	1
we	1
encountered	1
when	1
in	1
sight	1
of	1
port;	1
and	1
he	1
and	1
I	1
came	1
to	1
land	1
on	1
a	1
couple	1
of	1
planks	1
as	1
if	1
by	1
a	1
miracle;	1
and	1
indeed	1
the	1
whole	1
course	1
of	1
my	1
life	1
is	1
a	1
miracle	1
and	1
a	1
mystery	1
as	1
you	1
may	1
have	1
observed;	1
and	1
if	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
over	1
minute	1
in	1
any	1
respect	1
or	1
not	1
as	1
precise	1
as	1
I	1
ought,	1
let	1
it	1
be	1
accounted	1
for	1
by	1
what	1
the	1
licentiate	1
said	1
at	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
my	1
tale,	1
that	1
constant	1
and	1
excessive	1
troubles	1
deprive	1
the	1
sufferers	1
of	1
their	1
memory.”	1
“They	1
shall	1
not	1
deprive	1
me	1
of	1
mine,	1
exalted	1
and	1
worthy	1
princess,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“however	1
great	1
and	1
unexampled	1
those	1
which	1
I	1
shall	1
endure	1
in	1
your	1
service	1
may	1
be;	1
and	1
here	1
I	1
confirm	1
anew	1
the	1
boon	1
I	1
have	1
promised	1
you,	1
and	1
I	1
swear	1
to	1
go	1
with	1
you	1
to	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
until	1
I	1
find	1
myself	1
in	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
your	1
fierce	1
enemy,	1
whose	1
haughty	1
head	1
I	1
trust	1
by	1
the	1
aid	1
of	1
my	1
arm	1
to	1
cut	1
off	1
with	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
this—I	1
will	1
not	1
say	1
good	1
sword,	1
thanks	1
to	1
Gines	1
de	1
Pasamonte	1
who	1
carried	1
away	1
mine”—(this	1
he	1
said	1
between	1
his	1
teeth,	1
and	1
then	1
continued),	1
“and	1
when	1
it	1
has	1
been	1
cut	1
off	1
and	1
you	1
have	1
been	1
put	1
in	1
peaceful	1
possession	1
of	1
your	1
realm	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
left	1
to	1
your	1
own	1
decision	1
to	1
dispose	1
of	1
your	1
person	1
as	1
may	1
be	1
most	1
pleasing	1
to	1
you;	1
for	1
so	1
long	1
as	1
my	1
memory	1
is	1
occupied,	1
my	1
will	1
enslaved,	1
and	1
my	1
understanding	1
enthralled	1
by	1
her—I	1
say	1
no	1
more—it	1
is	1
impossible	1
for	1
me	1
for	1
a	1
moment	1
to	1
contemplate	1
marriage,	1
even	1
with	1
a	1
Phœnix.”	1
The	1
last	1
words	1
of	1
his	1
master	1
about	1
not	1
wanting	1
to	1
marry	1
were	1
so	1
disagreeable	1
to	1
Sancho	1
that	1
raising	1
his	1
voice	1
he	1
exclaimed	1
with	1
great	1
irritation:	1
“By	1
my	1
oath,	1
Señor	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
you	1
are	1
not	1
in	1
your	1
right	1
senses;	1
for	1
how	1
can	1
your	1
worship	1
possibly	1
object	1
to	1
marrying	1
such	1
an	1
exalted	1
princess	1
as	1
this?	1
Do	1
you	1
think	1
Fortune	1
will	1
offer	1
you	1
behind	1
every	1
stone	1
such	1
a	1
piece	1
of	1
luck	1
as	1
is	1
offered	1
you	1
now?	1
Is	1
my	1
lady	1
Dulcinea	1
fairer,	1
perchance?	1
Not	1
she;	1
nor	1
half	1
as	1
fair;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
even	1
go	1
so	1
far	1
as	1
to	1
say	1
she	1
does	1
not	1
come	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
shoe	1
of	1
this	1
one	1
here.	1
A	1
poor	1
chance	1
I	1
have	1
of	1
getting	1
that	1
county	1
I	1
am	1
waiting	1
for	1
if	1
your	1
worship	1
goes	1
looking	1
for	1
dainties	1
in	1
the	1
bottom	1
of	1
the	1
sea.	1
In	1
the	1
devil’s	1
name,	1
marry,	1
marry,	1
and	1
take	1
this	1
kingdom	1
that	1
comes	1
to	1
hand	1
without	1
any	1
trouble,	1
and	1
when	1
you	1
are	1
king	1
make	1
me	1
a	1
marquis	1
or	1
governor	1
of	1
a	1
province,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
rest	1
let	1
the	1
devil	1
take	1
it	1
all.”	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
when	1
he	1
heard	1
such	1
blasphemies	1
uttered	1
against	1
his	1
lady	1
Dulcinea,	1
could	1
not	1
endure	1
it,	1
and	1
lifting	1
his	1
pike,	1
without	1
saying	1
anything	1
to	1
Sancho	1
or	1
uttering	1
a	1
word,	1
he	1
gave	1
him	1
two	1
such	1
thwacks	1
that	1
he	1
brought	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
ground;	1
and	1
had	1
it	1
not	1
been	1
that	1
Dorothea	1
cried	1
out	1
to	1
him	1
to	1
spare	1
him	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
no	1
doubt	1
taken	1
his	1
life	1
on	1
the	1
spot.	1
“Do	1
you	1
think,”	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
him	1
after	1
a	1
pause,	1
“you	1
scurvy	1
clown,	1
that	1
you	1
are	1
to	1
be	1
always	1
interfering	1
with	1
me,	1
and	1
that	1
you	1
are	1
to	1
be	1
always	1
offending	1
and	1
I	1
always	1
pardoning?	1
Don’t	1
fancy	1
it,	1
impious	1
scoundrel,	1
for	1
that	1
beyond	1
a	1
doubt	1
thou	1
art,	1
since	1
thou	1
hast	1
set	1
thy	1
tongue	1
going	1
against	1
the	1
peerless	1
Dulcinea.	1
Know	1
you	1
not,	1
lout,	1
vagabond,	1
beggar,	1
that	1
were	1
it	1
not	1
for	1
the	1
might	1
that	1
she	1
infuses	1
into	1
my	1
arm	1
I	1
should	1
not	1
have	1
strength	1
enough	1
to	1
kill	1
a	1
flea?	1
Say,	1
scoffer	1
with	1
a	1
viper’s	1
tongue,	1
what	1
think	1
you	1
has	1
won	1
this	1
kingdom	1
and	1
cut	1
off	1
this	1
giant’s	1
head	1
and	1
made	1
you	1
a	1
marquis	1
(for	1
all	1
this	1
I	1
count	1
as	1
already	1
accomplished	1
and	1
decided),	1
but	1
the	1
might	1
of	1
Dulcinea,	1
employing	1
my	1
arm	1
as	1
the	1
instrument	1
of	1
her	1
achievements?	1
She	1
fights	1
in	1
me	1
and	1
conquers	1
in	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
live	1
and	1
breathe	1
in	1
her,	1
and	1
owe	1
my	1
life	1
and	1
being	1
to	1
her.	1
O	1
whoreson	1
scoundrel,	1
how	1
ungrateful	1
you	1
are,	1
you	1
see	1
yourself	1
raised	1
from	1
the	1
dust	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
titled	1
lord,	1
and	1
the	1
return	1
you	1
make	1
for	1
so	1
great	1
a	1
benefit	1
is	1
to	1
speak	1
evil	1
of	1
her	1
who	1
has	1
conferred	1
it	1
upon	1
you!”	1
Sancho	1
was	1
not	1
so	1
stunned	1
but	1
that	1
he	1
heard	1
all	1
his	1
master	1
said,	1
and	1
rising	1
with	1
some	1
degree	1
of	1
nimbleness	1
he	1
ran	1
to	1
place	1
himself	1
behind	1
Dorothea’s	1
palfrey,	1
and	1
from	1
that	1
position	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
his	1
master:	1
“Tell	1
me,	1
señor;	1
if	1
your	1
worship	1
is	1
resolved	1
not	1
to	1
marry	1
this	1
great	1
princess,	1
it	1
is	1
plain	1
the	1
kingdom	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
yours;	1
and	1
not	1
being	1
so,	1
how	1
can	1
you	1
bestow	1
favours	1
upon	1
me?	1
That	1
is	1
what	1
I	1
complain	1
of.	1
Let	1
your	1
worship	1
at	1
any	1
rate	1
marry	1
this	1
queen,	1
now	1
that	1
we	1
have	1
got	1
her	1
here	1
as	1
if	1
showered	1
down	1
from	1
heaven,	1
and	1
afterwards	1
you	1
may	1
go	1
back	1
to	1
my	1
lady	1
Dulcinea;	1
for	1
there	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
kings	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
who	1
kept	1
mistresses.	1
As	1
to	1
beauty,	1
I	1
have	1
nothing	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
it;	1
and	1
if	1
the	1
truth	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
told,	1
I	1
like	1
them	1
both;	1
though	1
I	1
have	1
never	1
seen	1
the	1
lady	1
Dulcinea.”	1
“How!	1
never	1
seen	1
her,	1
blasphemous	1
traitor!”	1
exclaimed	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
“hast	1
thou	1
not	1
just	1
now	1
brought	1
me	1
a	1
message	1
from	1
her?”	1
“I	1
mean,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“that	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
see	1
her	1
so	1
much	1
at	1
my	1
leisure	1
that	1
I	1
could	1
take	1
particular	1
notice	1
of	1
her	1
beauty,	1
or	1
of	1
her	1
charms	1
piecemeal;	1
but	1
taken	1
in	1
the	1
lump	1
I	1
like	1
her.”	1
“Now	1
I	1
forgive	1
thee,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
“and	1
do	1
thou	1
forgive	1
me	1
the	1
injury	1
I	1
have	1
done	1
thee;	1
for	1
our	1
first	1
impulses	1
are	1
not	1
in	1
our	1
control.”	1
“That	1
I	1
see,”	1
replied	1
Sancho,	1
“and	1
with	1
me	1
the	1
wish	1
to	1
speak	1
is	1
always	1
the	1
first	1
impulse,	1
and	1
I	1
cannot	1
help	1
saying,	1
once	1
at	1
any	1
rate,	1
what	1
I	1
have	1
on	1
the	1
tip	1
of	1
my	1
tongue.”	1
“For	1
all	1
that,	1
Sancho,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“take	1
heed	1
of	1
what	1
thou	1
sayest,	1
for	1
the	1
pitcher	1
goes	1
so	1
often	1
to	1
the	1
well—I	1
need	1
say	1
no	1
more	1
to	1
thee.”	1
“Well,	1
well,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“God	1
is	1
in	1
heaven,	1
and	1
sees	1
all	1
tricks,	1
and	1
will	1
judge	1
who	1
does	1
most	1
harm,	1
I	1
in	1
not	1
speaking	1
right,	1
or	1
your	1
worship	1
in	1
not	1
doing	1
it.”	1
“That	1
is	1
enough,”	1
said	1
Dorothea;	1
“run,	1
Sancho,	1
and	1
kiss	1
your	1
lord’s	1
hand	1
and	1
beg	1
his	1
pardon,	1
and	1
henceforward	1
be	1
more	1
circumspect	1
with	1
your	1
praise	1
and	1
abuse;	1
and	1
say	1
nothing	1
in	1
disparagement	1
of	1
that	1
lady	1
Toboso,	1
of	1
whom	1
I	1
know	1
nothing	1
save	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
her	1
servant;	1
and	1
put	1
your	1
trust	1
in	1
God,	1
for	1
you	1
will	1
not	1
fail	1
to	1
obtain	1
some	1
dignity	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
live	1
like	1
a	1
prince.”	1
Sancho	1
advanced	1
hanging	1
his	1
head	1
and	1
begged	1
his	1
master’s	1
hand,	1
which	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
with	1
dignity	1
presented	1
to	1
him,	1
giving	1
him	1
his	1
blessing	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
kissed	1
it;	1
he	1
then	1
bade	1
him	1
go	1
on	1
ahead	1
a	1
little,	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
questions	1
to	1
ask	1
him	1
and	1
matters	1
of	1
great	1
importance	1
to	1
discuss	1
with	1
him.	1
Sancho	1
obeyed,	1
and	1
when	1
the	1
two	1
had	1
gone	1
some	1
distance	1
in	1
advance	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
said	1
to	1
him,	1
“Since	1
thy	1
return	1
I	1
have	1
had	1
no	1
opportunity	1
or	1
time	1
to	1
ask	1
thee	1
many	1
particulars	1
touching	1
thy	1
mission	1
and	1
the	1
answer	1
thou	1
hast	1
brought	1
back,	1
and	1
now	1
that	1
chance	1
has	1
granted	1
us	1
the	1
time	1
and	1
opportunity,	1
deny	1
me	1
not	1
the	1
happiness	1
thou	1
canst	1
give	1
me	1
by	1
such	1
good	1
news.”	1
“Let	1
your	1
worship	1
ask	1
what	1
you	1
will,”	1
answered	1
Sancho,	1
“for	1
I	1
shall	1
find	1
a	1
way	1
out	1
of	1
all	1
as	1
I	1
found	1
a	1
way	1
in;	1
but	1
I	1
implore	1
you,	1
señor,	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
so	1
revengeful	1
in	1
future.”	1
“Why	1
dost	1
thou	1
say	1
that,	1
Sancho?”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote.	1
“I	1
say	1
it,”	1
he	1
returned,	1
“because	1
those	1
blows	1
just	1
now	1
were	1
more	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
quarrel	1
the	1
devil	1
stirred	1
up	1
between	1
us	1
both	1
the	1
other	1
night,	1
than	1
for	1
what	1
I	1
said	1
against	1
my	1
lady	1
Dulcinea,	1
whom	1
I	1
love	1
and	1
reverence	1
as	1
I	1
would	1
a	1
relic—though	1
there	1
is	1
nothing	1
of	1
that	1
about	1
her—merely	1
as	1
something	1
belonging	1
to	1
your	1
worship.”	1
“Say	1
no	1
more	1
on	1
that	1
subject	1
for	1
thy	1
life,	1
Sancho,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“for	1
it	1
is	1
displeasing	1
to	1
me;	1
I	1
have	1
already	1
pardoned	1
thee	1
for	1
that,	1
and	1
thou	1
knowest	1
the	1
common	1
saying,	1
‘for	1
a	1
fresh	1
sin	1
a	1
fresh	1
penance.’”	1
While	1
this	1
was	1
going	1
on	1
they	1
saw	1
coming	1
along	1
the	1
road	1
they	1
were	1
following	1
a	1
man	1
mounted	1
on	1
an	1
ass,	1
who	1
when	1
he	1
came	1
close	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
gipsy;	1
but	1
Sancho	1
Panza,	1
whose	1
eyes	1
and	1
heart	1
were	1
there	1
wherever	1
he	1
saw	1
asses,	1
no	1
sooner	1
beheld	1
the	1
man	1
than	1
he	1
knew	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
Gines	1
de	1
Pasamonte;	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
thread	1
of	1
the	1
gipsy	1
he	1
got	1
at	1
the	1
ball,	1
his	1
ass,	1
for	1
it	1
was,	1
in	1
fact,	1
Dapple	1
that	1
carried	1
Pasamonte,	1
who	1
to	1
escape	1
recognition	1
and	1
to	1
sell	1
the	1
ass	1
had	1
disguised	1
himself	1
as	1
a	1
gipsy,	1
being	1
able	1
to	1
speak	1
the	1
gipsy	1
language,	1
and	1
many	1
more,	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
if	1
they	1
were	1
his	1
own.	1
Sancho	1
saw	1
him	1
and	1
recognised	1
him,	1
and	1
the	1
instant	1
he	1
did	1
so	1
he	1
shouted	1
to	1
him,	1
“Ginesillo,	1
you	1
thief,	1
give	1
up	1
my	1
treasure,	1
release	1
my	1
life,	1
embarrass	1
thyself	1
not	1
with	1
my	1
repose,	1
quit	1
my	1
ass,	1
leave	1
my	1
delight,	1
be	1
off,	1
rip,	1
get	1
thee	1
gone,	1
thief,	1
and	1
give	1
up	1
what	1
is	1
not	1
thine.”	1
There	1
was	1
no	1
necessity	1
for	1
so	1
many	1
words	1
or	1
objurgations,	1
for	1
at	1
the	1
first	1
one	1
Gines	1
jumped	1
down,	1
and	1
at	1
a	1
like	1
racing	1
speed	1
made	1
off	1
and	1
got	1
clear	1
of	1
them	1
all.	1
Sancho	1
hastened	1
to	1
his	1
Dapple,	1
and	1
embracing	1
him	1
he	1
said,	1
“How	1
hast	1
thou	1
fared,	1
my	1
blessing,	1
Dapple	1
of	1
my	1
eyes,	1
my	1
comrade?”	1
all	1
the	1
while	1
kissing	1
him	1
and	1
caressing	1
him	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
were	1
a	1
human	1
being.	1
The	1
ass	1
held	1
his	1
peace,	1
and	1
let	1
himself	1
be	1
kissed	1
and	1
caressed	1
by	1
Sancho	1
without	1
answering	1
a	1
single	1
word.	1
They	1
all	1
came	1
up	1
and	1
congratulated	1
him	1
on	1
having	1
found	1
Dapple,	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
especially,	1
who	1
told	1
him	1
that	1
notwithstanding	1
this	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
cancel	1
the	1
order	1
for	1
the	1
three	1
ass-colts,	1
for	1
which	1
Sancho	1
thanked	1
him.	1
While	1
the	1
two	1
had	1
been	1
going	1
along	1
conversing	1
in	1
this	1
fashion,	1
the	1
curate	1
observed	1
to	1
Dorothea	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
shown	1
great	1
cleverness,	1
as	1
well	1
in	1
the	1
story	1
itself	1
as	1
in	1
its	1
conciseness,	1
and	1
the	1
resemblance	1
it	1
bore	1
to	1
those	1
of	1
the	1
books	1
of	1
chivalry.	1
She	1
said	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
many	1
times	1
amused	1
herself	1
reading	1
them;	1
but	1
that	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
the	1
situation	1
of	1
the	1
provinces	1
or	1
seaports,	1
and	1
so	1
she	1
had	1
said	1
at	1
haphazard	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
landed	1
at	1
Osuna.	1
“So	1
I	1
saw,”	1
said	1
the	1
curate,	1
“and	1
for	1
that	1
reason	1
I	1
made	1
haste	1
to	1
say	1
what	1
I	1
did,	1
by	1
which	1
it	1
was	1
all	1
set	1
right.	1
But	1
is	1
it	1
not	1
a	1
strange	1
thing	1
to	1
see	1
how	1
readily	1
this	1
unhappy	1
gentleman	1
believes	1
all	1
these	1
figments	1
and	1
lies,	1
simply	1
because	1
they	1
are	1
in	1
the	1
style	1
and	1
manner	1
of	1
the	1
absurdities	1
of	1
his	1
books?”	1
“So	1
it	1
is,”	1
said	1
Cardenio;	1
“and	1
so	1
uncommon	1
and	1
unexampled,	1
that	1
were	1
one	1
to	1
attempt	1
to	1
invent	1
and	1
concoct	1
it	1
in	1
fiction,	1
I	1
doubt	1
if	1
there	1
be	1
any	1
wit	1
keen	1
enough	1
to	1
imagine	1
it.”	1
“But	1
another	1
strange	1
thing	1
about	1
it,”	1
said	1
the	1
curate,	1
“is	1
that,	1
apart	1
from	1
the	1
silly	1
things	1
which	1
this	1
worthy	1
gentleman	1
says	1
in	1
connection	1
with	1
his	1
craze,	1
when	1
other	1
subjects	1
are	1
dealt	1
with,	1
he	1
can	1
discuss	1
them	1
in	1
a	1
perfectly	1
rational	1
manner,	1
showing	1
that	1
his	1
mind	1
is	1
quite	1
clear	1
and	1
composed;	1
so	1
that,	1
provided	1
his	1
chivalry	1
is	1
not	1
touched	1
upon,	1
no	1
one	1
would	1
take	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
anything	1
but	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
thoroughly	1
sound	1
understanding.”	1
While	1
they	1
were	1
holding	1
this	1
conversation	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
continued	1
his	1
with	1
Sancho,	1
saying:	1
“Friend	1
Panza,	1
let	1
us	1
forgive	1
and	1
forget	1
as	1
to	1
our	1
quarrels,	1
and	1
tell	1
me	1
now,	1
dismissing	1
anger	1
and	1
irritation,	1
where,	1
how,	1
and	1
when	1
didst	1
thou	1
find	1
Dulcinea?	1
What	1
was	1
she	1
doing?	1
What	1
didst	1
thou	1
say	1
to	1
her?	1
What	1
did	1
she	1
answer?	1
How	1
did	1
she	1
look	1
when	1
she	1
was	1
reading	1
my	1
letter?	1
Who	1
copied	1
it	1
out	1
for	1
thee?	1
and	1
everything	1
in	1
the	1
matter	1
that	1
seems	1
to	1
thee	1
worth	1
knowing,	1
asking,	1
and	1
learning;	1
neither	1
adding	1
nor	1
falsifying	1
to	1
give	1
me	1
pleasure,	1
nor	1
yet	1
curtailing	1
lest	1
you	1
should	1
deprive	1
me	1
of	1
it.”	1
“Señor,”	1
replied	1
Sancho,	1
“if	1
the	1
truth	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
told,	1
nobody	1
copied	1
out	1
the	1
letter	1
for	1
me,	1
for	1
I	1
carried	1
no	1
letter	1
at	1
all.”	1
“It	1
is	1
as	1
thou	1
sayest,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“for	1
the	1
notebook	1
in	1
which	1
I	1
wrote	1
it	1
I	1
found	1
in	1
my	1
own	1
possession	1
two	1
days	1
after	1
thy	1
departure,	1
which	1
gave	1
me	1
very	1
great	1
vexation,	1
as	1
I	1
knew	1
not	1
what	1
thou	1
wouldst	1
do	1
on	1
finding	1
thyself	1
without	1
any	1
letter;	1
and	1
I	1
made	1
sure	1
thou	1
wouldst	1
return	1
from	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
thou	1
didst	1
first	1
miss	1
it.”	1
“So	1
I	1
should	1
have	1
done,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“if	1
I	1
had	1
not	1
got	1
it	1
by	1
heart	1
when	1
your	1
worship	1
read	1
it	1
to	1
me,	1
so	1
that	1
I	1
repeated	1
it	1
to	1
a	1
sacristan,	1
who	1
copied	1
it	1
out	1
for	1
me	1
from	1
hearing	1
it,	1
so	1
exactly	1
that	1
he	1
said	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
his	1
life,	1
though	1
he	1
had	1
read	1
many	1
a	1
letter	1
of	1
excommunication,	1
he	1
had	1
never	1
seen	1
or	1
read	1
so	1
pretty	1
a	1
letter	1
as	1
that.”	1
“And	1
hast	1
thou	1
got	1
it	1
still	1
in	1
thy	1
memory,	1
Sancho?”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote.	1
“No,	1
señor,”	1
replied	1
Sancho,	1
“for	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
I	1
had	1
repeated	1
it,	1
seeing	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
further	1
use	1
for	1
it,	1
I	1
set	1
about	1
forgetting	1
it;	1
and	1
if	1
I	1
recollect	1
any	1
of	1
it,	1
it	1
is	1
that	1
about	1
‘Scrubbing,’	1
I	1
mean	1
to	1
say	1
‘Sovereign	1
Lady,’	1
and	1
the	1
end	1
‘Yours	1
till	1
death,	1
the	1
Knight	1
of	1
the	1
Rueful	1
Countenance;’	1
and	1
between	1
these	1
two	1
I	1
put	1
into	1
it	1
more	1
than	1
three	1
hundred	1
‘my	1
souls’	1
and	1
‘my	1
life’s’	1
and	1
‘my	1
eyes.”	1

“All	1
that	1
is	1
not	1
unsatisfactory	1
to	1
me,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote.	1
“Go	1
on;	1
thou	1
didst	1
reach	1
her;	1
and	1
what	1
was	1
that	1
queen	1
of	1
beauty	1
doing?	1
Surely	1
thou	1
didst	1
find	1
her	1
stringing	1
pearls,	1
or	1
embroidering	1
some	1
device	1
in	1
gold	1
thread	1
for	1
this	1
her	1
enslaved	1
knight.”	1
“I	1
did	1
not,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“but	1
I	1
found	1
her	1
winnowing	1
two	1
bushels	1
of	1
wheat	1
in	1
the	1
yard	1
of	1
her	1
house.”	1
“Then	1
depend	1
upon	1
it,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“the	1
grains	1
of	1
that	1
wheat	1
were	1
pearls	1
when	1
touched	1
by	1
her	1
hands;	1
and	1
didst	1
thou	1
look,	1
friend?	1
was	1
it	1
white	1
wheat	1
or	1
brown?”	1
“It	1
was	1
neither,	1
but	1
red,”	1
said	1
Sancho.	1
“Then	1
I	1
promise	1
thee,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“that,	1
winnowed	1
by	1
her	1
hands,	1
beyond	1
a	1
doubt	1
the	1
bread	1
it	1
made	1
was	1
of	1
the	1
whitest;	1
but	1
go	1
on;	1
when	1
thou	1
gavest	1
her	1
my	1
letter,	1
did	1
she	1
kiss	1
it?	1
Did	1
she	1
place	1
it	1
on	1
her	1
head?	1
Did	1
she	1
perform	1
any	1
ceremony	1
befitting	1
it,	1
or	1
what	1
did	1
she	1
do?”	1
“When	1
I	1
went	1
to	1
give	1
it	1
to	1
her,”	1
replied	1
Sancho,	1
“she	1
was	1
hard	1
at	1
it	1
swaying	1
from	1
side	1
to	1
side	1
with	1
a	1
lot	1
of	1
wheat	1
she	1
had	1
in	1
the	1
sieve,	1
and	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
me,	1
‘Lay	1
the	1
letter,	1
friend,	1
on	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
that	1
sack,	1
for	1
I	1
cannot	1
read	1
it	1
until	1
I	1
have	1
done	1
sifting	1
all	1
this.”	1
“Discreet	1
lady!”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
“that	1
was	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
read	1
it	1
at	1
her	1
leisure	1
and	1
enjoy	1
it;	1
proceed,	1
Sancho;	1
while	1
she	1
was	1
engaged	1
in	1
her	1
occupation	1
what	1
converse	1
did	1
she	1
hold	1
with	1
thee?	1
What	1
did	1
she	1
ask	1
about	1
me,	1
and	1
what	1
answer	1
didst	1
thou	1
give?	1
Make	1
haste;	1
tell	1
me	1
all,	1
and	1
let	1
not	1
an	1
atom	1
be	1
left	1
behind	1
in	1
the	1
ink-bottle.”	1
“She	1
asked	1
me	1
nothing,”	1
said	1
Sancho;	1
“but	1
I	1
told	1
her	1
how	1
your	1
worship	1
was	1
left	1
doing	1
penance	1
in	1
her	1
service,	1
naked	1
from	1
the	1
waist	1
up,	1
in	1
among	1
these	1
mountains	1
like	1
a	1
savage,	1
sleeping	1
on	1
the	1
ground,	1
not	1
eating	1
bread	1
off	1
a	1
tablecloth	1
nor	1
combing	1
your	1
beard,	1
weeping	1
and	1
cursing	1
your	1
fortune.”	1
“In	1
saying	1
I	1
cursed	1
my	1
fortune	1
thou	1
saidst	1
wrong,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
“for	1
rather	1
do	1
I	1
bless	1
it	1
and	1
shall	1
bless	1
it	1
all	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
my	1
life	1
for	1
having	1
made	1
me	1
worthy	1
of	1
aspiring	1
to	1
love	1
so	1
lofty	1
a	1
lady	1
as	1
Dulcinea	1
del	1
Toboso.”	1
“And	1
so	1
lofty	1
she	1
is,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“that	1
she	1
overtops	1
me	1
by	1
more	1
than	1
a	1
hand’s-breadth.”	1
“What!	1
Sancho,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“didst	1
thou	1
measure	1
with	1
her?”	1
“I	1
measured	1
in	1
this	1
way,”	1
said	1
Sancho;	1
“going	1
to	1
help	1
her	1
to	1
put	1
a	1
sack	1
of	1
wheat	1
on	1
the	1
back	1
of	1
an	1
ass,	1
we	1
came	1
so	1
close	1
together	1
that	1
I	1
could	1
see	1
she	1
stood	1
more	1
than	1
a	1
good	1
palm	1
over	1
me.”	1
“Well!”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“and	1
doth	1
she	1
not	1
of	1
a	1
truth	1
accompany	1
and	1
adorn	1
this	1
greatness	1
with	1
a	1
thousand	1
million	1
charms	1
of	1
mind!	1
But	1
one	1
thing	1
thou	1
wilt	1
not	1
deny,	1
Sancho;	1
when	1
thou	1
camest	1
close	1
to	1
her	1
didst	1
thou	1
not	1
perceive	1
a	1
Sabæan	1
odour,	1
an	1
aromatic	1
fragrance,	1
a,	1
I	1
know	1
not	1
what,	1
delicious,	1
that	1
I	1
cannot	1
find	1
a	1
name	1
for;	1
I	1
mean	1
a	1
redolence,	1
an	1
exhalation,	1
as	1
if	1
thou	1
wert	1
in	1
the	1
shop	1
of	1
some	1
dainty	1
glover?”	1
“All	1
I	1
can	1
say	1
is,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“that	1
I	1
did	1
perceive	1
a	1
little	1
odour,	1
something	1
goaty;	1
it	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
all	1
in	1
a	1
sweat	1
with	1
hard	1
work.”	1
“It	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
that,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“but	1
thou	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
suffering	1
from	1
cold	1
in	1
the	1
head,	1
or	1
must	1
have	1
smelt	1
thyself;	1
for	1
I	1
know	1
well	1
what	1
would	1
be	1
the	1
scent	1
of	1
that	1
rose	1
among	1
thorns,	1
that	1
lily	1
of	1
the	1
field,	1
that	1
dissolved	1
amber.”	1
“Maybe	1
so,”	1
replied	1
Sancho;	1
“there	1
often	1
comes	1
from	1
myself	1
that	1
same	1
odour	1
which	1
then	1
seemed	1
to	1
me	1
to	1
come	1
from	1
her	1
grace	1
the	1
lady	1
Dulcinea;	1
but	1
that’s	1
no	1
wonder,	1
for	1
one	1
devil	1
is	1
like	1
another.”	1
“Well	1
then,”	1
continued	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“now	1
she	1
has	1
done	1
sifting	1
the	1
corn	1
and	1
sent	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
mill;	1
what	1
did	1
she	1
do	1
when	1
she	1
read	1
the	1
letter?”	1
“As	1
for	1
the	1
letter,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“she	1
did	1
not	1
read	1
it,	1
for	1
she	1
said	1
she	1
could	1
neither	1
read	1
nor	1
write;	1
instead	1
of	1
that	1
she	1
tore	1
it	1
up	1
into	1
small	1
pieces,	1
saying	1
that	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
want	1
to	1
let	1
anyone	1
read	1
it	1
lest	1
her	1
secrets	1
should	1
become	1
known	1
in	1
the	1
village,	1
and	1
that	1
what	1
I	1
had	1
told	1
her	1
by	1
word	1
of	1
mouth	1
about	1
the	1
love	1
your	1
worship	1
bore	1
her,	1
and	1
the	1
extraordinary	1
penance	1
you	1
were	1
doing	1
for	1
her	1
sake,	1
was	1
enough;	1
and,	1
to	1
make	1
an	1
end	1
of	1
it,	1
she	1
told	1
me	1
to	1
tell	1
your	1
worship	1
that	1
she	1
kissed	1
your	1
hands,	1
and	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
a	1
greater	1
desire	1
to	1
see	1
you	1
than	1
to	1
write	1
to	1
you;	1
and	1
that	1
therefore	1
she	1
entreated	1
and	1
commanded	1
you,	1
on	1
sight	1
of	1
this	1
present,	1
to	1
come	1
out	1
of	1
these	1
thickets,	1
and	1
to	1
have	1
done	1
with	1
carrying	1
on	1
absurdities,	1
and	1
to	1
set	1
out	1
at	1
once	1
for	1
El	1
Toboso,	1
unless	1
something	1
else	1
of	1
greater	1
importance	1
should	1
happen,	1
for	1
she	1
had	1
a	1
great	1
desire	1
to	1
see	1
your	1
worship.	1
She	1
laughed	1
greatly	1
when	1
I	1
told	1
her	1
how	1
your	1
worship	1
was	1
called	1
The	1
Knight	1
of	1
the	1
Rueful	1
Countenance;	1
I	1
asked	1
her	1
if	1
that	1
Biscayan	1
the	1
other	1
day	1
had	1
been	1
there;	1
and	1
she	1
told	1
me	1
he	1
had,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
an	1
honest	1
fellow;	1
I	1
asked	1
her	1
too	1
about	1
the	1
galley	1
slaves,	1
but	1
she	1
said	1
she	1
had	1
not	1
seen	1
any	1
as	1
yet.”	1
“So	1
far	1
all	1
goes	1
well,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
“but	1
tell	1
me	1
what	1
jewel	1
was	1
it	1
that	1
she	1
gave	1
thee	1
on	1
taking	1
thy	1
leave,	1
in	1
return	1
for	1
thy	1
tidings	1
of	1
me?	1
For	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
usual	1
and	1
ancient	1
custom	1
with	1
knights	1
and	1
ladies	1
errant	1
to	1
give	1
the	1
squires,	1
damsels,	1
or	1
dwarfs	1
who	1
bring	1
tidings	1
of	1
their	1
ladies	1
to	1
the	1
knights,	1
or	1
of	1
their	1
knights	1
to	1
the	1
ladies,	1
some	1
rich	1
jewel	1
as	1
a	1
guerdon	1
for	1
good	1
news,	1
and	1
acknowledgment	1
of	1
the	1
message.”	1
“That	1
is	1
very	1
likely,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“and	1
a	1
good	1
custom	1
it	1
was,	1
to	1
my	1
mind;	1
but	1
that	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
in	1
days	1
gone	1
by,	1
for	1
now	1
it	1
would	1
seem	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
custom	1
only	1
to	1
give	1
a	1
piece	1
of	1
bread	1
and	1
cheese;	1
because	1
that	1
was	1
what	1
my	1
lady	1
Dulcinea	1
gave	1
me	1
over	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
yard-wall	1
when	1
I	1
took	1
leave	1
of	1
her;	1
and	1
more	1
by	1
token	1
it	1
was	1
sheep’s-milk	1
cheese.”	1
“She	1
is	1
generous	1
in	1
the	1
extreme,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“and	1
if	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
give	1
thee	1
a	1
jewel	1
of	1
gold,	1
no	1
doubt	1
it	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
because	1
she	1
had	1
not	1
one	1
to	1
hand	1
there	1
to	1
give	1
thee;	1
but	1
sleeves	1
are	1
good	1
after	1
Easter;	1
I	1
shall	1
see	1
her	1
and	1
all	1
shall	1
be	1
made	1
right.	1
But	1
knowest	1
thou	1
what	1
amazes	1
me,	1
Sancho?	1
It	1
seems	1
to	1
me	1
thou	1
must	1
have	1
gone	1
and	1
come	1
through	1
the	1
air,	1
for	1
thou	1
hast	1
taken	1
but	1
little	1
more	1
than	1
three	1
days	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
El	1
Toboso	1
and	1
return,	1
though	1
it	1
is	1
more	1
than	1
thirty	1
leagues	1
from	1
here	1
to	1
there.	1
From	1
which	1
I	1
am	1
inclined	1
to	1
think	1
that	1
the	1
sage	1
magician	1
who	1
is	1
my	1
friend,	1
and	1
watches	1
over	1
my	1
interests	1
(for	1
of	1
necessity	1
there	1
is	1
and	1
must	1
be	1
one,	1
or	1
else	1
I	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
a	1
right	1
knight-errant),	1
that	1
this	1
same,	1
I	1
say,	1
must	1
have	1
helped	1
thee	1
to	1
travel	1
without	1
thy	1
knowledge;	1
for	1
some	1
of	1
these	1
sages	1
will	1
catch	1
up	1
a	1
knight-errant	1
sleeping	1
in	1
his	1
bed,	1
and	1
without	1
his	1
knowing	1
how	1
or	1
in	1
what	1
way	1
it	1
happened,	1
he	1
wakes	1
up	1
the	1
next	1
day	1
more	1
than	1
a	1
thousand	1
leagues	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
he	1
went	1
to	1
sleep.	1
And	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
not	1
for	1
this,	1
knights-errant	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
give	1
aid	1
to	1
one	1
another	1
in	1
peril,	1
as	1
they	1
do	1
at	1
every	1
turn.	1
For	1
a	1
knight,	1
maybe,	1
is	1
fighting	1
in	1
the	1
mountains	1
of	1
Armenia	1
with	1
some	1
dragon,	1
or	1
fierce	1
serpent,	1
or	1
another	1
knight,	1
and	1
gets	1
the	1
worst	1
of	1
the	1
battle,	1
and	1
is	1
at	1
the	1
point	1
of	1
death;	1
but	1
when	1
he	1
least	1
looks	1
for	1
it,	1
there	1
appears	1
over	1
against	1
him	1
on	1
a	1
cloud,	1
or	1
chariot	1
of	1
fire,	1
another	1
knight,	1
a	1
friend	1
of	1
his,	1
who	1
just	1
before	1
had	1
been	1
in	1
England,	1
and	1
who	1
takes	1
his	1
part,	1
and	1
delivers	1
him	1
from	1
death;	1
and	1
at	1
night	1
he	1
finds	1
himself	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
quarters	1
supping	1
very	1
much	1
to	1
his	1
satisfaction;	1
and	1
yet	1
from	1
one	1
place	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
will	1
have	1
been	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
thousand	1
leagues.	1
And	1
all	1
this	1
is	1
done	1
by	1
the	1
craft	1
and	1
skill	1
of	1
the	1
sage	1
enchanters	1
who	1
take	1
care	1
of	1
those	1
valiant	1
knights;	1
so	1
that,	1
friend	1
Sancho,	1
I	1
find	1
no	1
difficulty	1
in	1
believing	1
that	1
thou	1
mayest	1
have	1
gone	1
from	1
this	1
place	1
to	1
El	1
Toboso	1
and	1
returned	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
short	1
time,	1
since,	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
said,	1
some	1
friendly	1
sage	1
must	1
have	1
carried	1
thee	1
through	1
the	1
air	1
without	1
thee	1
perceiving	1
it.”	1
“That	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
it,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“for	1
indeed	1
Rocinante	1
went	1
like	1
a	1
gipsy’s	1
ass	1
with	1
quicksilver	1
in	1
his	1
ears.”	1
“Quicksilver!”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“aye	1
and	1
what	1
is	1
more,	1
a	1
legion	1
of	1
devils,	1
folk	1
that	1
can	1
travel	1
and	1
make	1
others	1
travel	1
without	1
being	1
weary,	1
exactly	1
as	1
the	1
whim	1
seizes	1
them.	1
But	1
putting	1
this	1
aside,	1
what	1
thinkest	1
thou	1
I	1
ought	1
to	1
do	1
about	1
my	1
lady’s	1
command	1
to	1
go	1
and	1
see	1
her?	1
For	1
though	1
I	1
feel	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
bound	1
to	1
obey	1
her	1
mandate,	1
I	1
feel	1
too	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
debarred	1
by	1
the	1
boon	1
I	1
have	1
accorded	1
to	1
the	1
princess	1
that	1
accompanies	1
us,	1
and	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
chivalry	1
compels	1
me	1
to	1
have	1
regard	1
for	1
my	1
word	1
in	1
preference	1
to	1
my	1
inclination;	1
on	1
the	1
one	1
hand	1
the	1
desire	1
to	1
see	1
my	1
lady	1
pursues	1
and	1
harasses	1
me,	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
my	1
solemn	1
promise	1
and	1
the	1
glory	1
I	1
shall	1
win	1
in	1
this	1
enterprise	1
urge	1
and	1
call	1
me;	1
but	1
what	1
I	1
think	1
I	1
shall	1
do	1
is	1
to	1
travel	1
with	1
all	1
speed	1
and	1
reach	1
quickly	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
this	1
giant	1
is,	1
and	1
on	1
my	1
arrival	1
I	1
shall	1
cut	1
off	1
his	1
head,	1
and	1
establish	1
the	1
princess	1
peacefully	1
in	1
her	1
realm,	1
and	1
forthwith	1
I	1
shall	1
return	1
to	1
behold	1
the	1
light	1
that	1
lightens	1
my	1
senses,	1
to	1
whom	1
I	1
shall	1
make	1
such	1
excuses	1
that	1
she	1
will	1
be	1
led	1
to	1
approve	1
of	1
my	1
delay,	1
for	1
she	1
will	1
see	1
that	1
it	1
entirely	1
tends	1
to	1
increase	1
her	1
glory	1
and	1
fame;	1
for	1
all	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
won,	1
am	1
winning,	1
or	1
shall	1
win	1
by	1
arms	1
in	1
this	1
life,	1
comes	1
to	1
me	1
of	1
the	1
favour	1
she	1
extends	1
to	1
me,	1
and	1
because	1
I	1
am	1
hers.”	1
“Ah!	1
what	1
a	1
sad	1
state	1
your	1
worship’s	1
brains	1
are	1
in!”	1
said	1
Sancho.	1
“Tell	1
me,	1
señor,	1
do	1
you	1
mean	1
to	1
travel	1
all	1
that	1
way	1
for	1
nothing,	1
and	1
to	1
let	1
slip	1
and	1
lose	1
so	1
rich	1
and	1
great	1
a	1
match	1
as	1
this	1
where	1
they	1
give	1
as	1
a	1
portion	1
a	1
kingdom	1
that	1
in	1
sober	1
truth	1
I	1
have	1
heard	1
say	1
is	1
more	1
than	1
twenty	1
thousand	1
leagues	1
round	1
about,	1
and	1
abounds	1
with	1
all	1
things	1
necessary	1
to	1
support	1
human	1
life,	1
and	1
is	1
bigger	1
than	1
Portugal	1
and	1
Castile	1
put	1
together?	1
Peace,	1
for	1
the	1
love	1
of	1
God!	1
Blush	1
for	1
what	1
you	1
have	1
said,	1
and	1
take	1
my	1
advice,	1
and	1
forgive	1
me,	1
and	1
marry	1
at	1
once	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
village	1
where	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
curate;	1
if	1
not,	1
here	1
is	1
our	1
licentiate	1
who	1
will	1
do	1
the	1
business	1
beautifully;	1
remember,	1
I	1
am	1
old	1
enough	1
to	1
give	1
advice,	1
and	1
this	1
I	1
am	1
giving	1
comes	1
pat	1
to	1
the	1
purpose;	1
for	1
a	1
sparrow	1
in	1
the	1
hand	1
is	1
better	1
than	1
a	1
vulture	1
on	1
the	1
wing,	1
and	1
he	1
who	1
has	1
the	1
good	1
to	1
his	1
hand	1
and	1
chooses	1
the	1
bad,	1
that	1
the	1
good	1
he	1
complains	1
of	1
may	1
not	1
come	1
to	1
him.”	1
“Look	1
here,	1
Sancho,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote.	1
“If	1
thou	1
art	1
advising	1
me	1
to	1
marry,	1
in	1
order	1
that	1
immediately	1
on	1
slaying	1
the	1
giant	1
I	1
may	1
become	1
king,	1
and	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
confer	1
favours	1
on	1
thee,	1
and	1
give	1
thee	1
what	1
I	1
have	1
promised,	1
let	1
me	1
tell	1
thee	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
able	1
very	1
easily	1
to	1
satisfy	1
thy	1
desires	1
without	1
marrying;	1
for	1
before	1
going	1
into	1
battle	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
it	1
a	1
stipulation	1
that,	1
if	1
I	1
come	1
out	1
of	1
it	1
victorious,	1
even	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
marry,	1
they	1
shall	1
give	1
me	1
a	1
portion	1
of	1
the	1
kingdom,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
bestow	1
it	1
upon	1
whomsoever	1
I	1
choose,	1
and	1
when	1
they	1
give	1
it	1
to	1
me	1
upon	1
whom	1
wouldst	1
thou	1
have	1
me	1
bestow	1
it	1
but	1
upon	1
thee?”	1
“That	1
is	1
plain	1
speaking,”	1
said	1
Sancho;	1
“but	1
let	1
your	1
worship	1
take	1
care	1
to	1
choose	1
it	1
on	1
the	1
seacoast,	1
so	1
that	1
if	1
I	1
don’t	1
like	1
the	1
life,	1
I	1
may	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
ship	1
off	1
my	1
black	1
vassals	1
and	1
deal	1
with	1
them	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
said;	1
don’t	1
mind	1
going	1
to	1
see	1
my	1
lady	1
Dulcinea	1
now,	1
but	1
go	1
and	1
kill	1
this	1
giant	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
finish	1
off	1
this	1
business;	1
for	1
by	1
God	1
it	1
strikes	1
me	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
one	1
of	1
great	1
honour	1
and	1
great	1
profit.”	1
“I	1
hold	1
thou	1
art	1
in	1
the	1
right	1
of	1
it,	1
Sancho,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“and	1
I	1
will	1
take	1
thy	1
advice	1
as	1
to	1
accompanying	1
the	1
princess	1
before	1
going	1
to	1
see	1
Dulcinea;	1
but	1
I	1
counsel	1
thee	1
not	1
to	1
say	1
anything	1
to	1
anyone,	1
or	1
to	1
those	1
who	1
are	1
with	1
us,	1
about	1
what	1
we	1
have	1
considered	1
and	1
discussed,	1
for	1
as	1
Dulcinea	1
is	1
so	1
decorous	1
that	1
she	1
does	1
not	1
wish	1
her	1
thoughts	1
to	1
be	1
known	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
right	1
that	1
I	1
or	1
anyone	1
for	1
me	1
should	1
disclose	1
them.”	1
“Well	1
then,	1
if	1
that	1
be	1
so,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“how	1
is	1
it	1
that	1
your	1
worship	1
makes	1
all	1
those	1
you	1
overcome	1
by	1
your	1
arm	1
go	1
to	1
present	1
themselves	1
before	1
my	1
lady	1
Dulcinea,	1
this	1
being	1
the	1
same	1
thing	1
as	1
signing	1
your	1
name	1
to	1
it	1
that	1
you	1
love	1
her	1
and	1
are	1
her	1
lover?	1
And	1
as	1
those	1
who	1
go	1
must	1
perforce	1
kneel	1
before	1
her	1
and	1
say	1
they	1
come	1
from	1
your	1
worship	1
to	1
submit	1
themselves	1
to	1
her,	1
how	1
can	1
the	1
thoughts	1
of	1
both	1
of	1
you	1
be	1
hid?”	1
“O,	1
how	1
silly	1
and	1
simple	1
thou	1
art!”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
“seest	1
thou	1
not,	1
Sancho,	1
that	1
this	1
tends	1
to	1
her	1
greater	1
exaltation?	1
For	1
thou	1
must	1
know	1
that	1
according	1
to	1
our	1
way	1
of	1
thinking	1
in	1
chivalry,	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
high	1
honour	1
to	1
a	1
lady	1
to	1
have	1
many	1
knights-errant	1
in	1
her	1
service,	1
whose	1
thoughts	1
never	1
go	1
beyond	1
serving	1
her	1
for	1
her	1
own	1
sake,	1
and	1
who	1
look	1
for	1
no	1
other	1
reward	1
for	1
their	1
great	1
and	1
true	1
devotion	1
than	1
that	1
she	1
should	1
be	1
willing	1
to	1
accept	1
them	1
as	1
her	1
knights.”	1
“It	1
is	1
with	1
that	1
kind	1
of	1
love,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“I	1
have	1
heard	1
preachers	1
say	1
we	1
ought	1
to	1
love	1
our	1
Lord,	1
for	1
himself	1
alone,	1
without	1
being	1
moved	1
by	1
the	1
hope	1
of	1
glory	1
or	1
the	1
fear	1
of	1
punishment;	1
though	1
for	1
my	1
part,	1
I	1
would	1
rather	1
love	1
and	1
serve	1
him	1
for	1
what	1
he	1
could	1
do.”	1
“The	1
devil	1
take	1
thee	1
for	1
a	1
clown!”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“and	1
what	1
shrewd	1
things	1
thou	1
sayest	1
at	1
times!	1
One	1
would	1
think	1
thou	1
hadst	1
studied.”	1
“In	1
faith,	1
then,	1
I	1
cannot	1
even	1
read.”	1
Master	1
Nicholas	1
here	1
called	1
out	1
to	1
them	1
to	1
wait	1
a	1
while,	1
as	1
they	1
wanted	1
to	1
halt	1
and	1
drink	1
at	1
a	1
little	1
spring	1
there	1
was	1
there.	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
drew	1
up,	1
not	1
a	1
little	1
to	1
the	1
satisfaction	1
of	1
Sancho,	1
for	1
he	1
was	1
by	1
this	1
time	1
weary	1
of	1
telling	1
so	1
many	1
lies,	1
and	1
in	1
dread	1
of	1
his	1
master	1
catching	1
him	1
tripping,	1
for	1
though	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
Dulcinea	1
was	1
a	1
peasant	1
girl	1
of	1
El	1
Toboso,	1
he	1
had	1
never	1
seen	1
her	1
in	1
all	1
his	1
life.	1
Cardenio	1
had	1
now	1
put	1
on	1
the	1
clothes	1
which	1
Dorothea	1
was	1
wearing	1
when	1
they	1
found	1
her,	1
and	1
though	1
they	1
were	1
not	1
very	1
good,	1
they	1
were	1
far	1
better	1
than	1
those	1
he	1
put	1
off.	1
They	1
dismounted	1
together	1
by	1
the	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
spring,	1
and	1
with	1
what	1
the	1
curate	1
had	1
provided	1
himself	1
with	1
at	1
the	1
inn	1
they	1
appeased,	1
though	1
not	1
very	1
well,	1
the	1
keen	1
appetite	1
they	1
all	1
of	1
them	1
brought	1
with	1
them.	1
While	1
they	1
were	1
so	1
employed	1
there	1
happened	1
to	1
come	1
by	1
a	1
youth	1
passing	1
on	1
his	1
way,	1
who	1
stopping	1
to	1
examine	1
the	1
party	1
at	1
the	1
spring,	1
the	1
next	1
moment	1
ran	1
to	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
and	1
clasping	1
him	1
round	1
the	1
legs,	1
began	1
to	1
weep	1
freely,	1
saying,	1
“O,	1
señor,	1
do	1
you	1
not	1
know	1
me?	1
Look	1
at	1
me	1
well;	1
I	1
am	1
that	1
lad	1
Andres	1
that	1
your	1
worship	1
released	1
from	1
the	1
oak-tree	1
where	1
I	1
was	1
tied.”	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
recognised	1
him,	1
and	1
taking	1
his	1
hand	1
he	1
turned	1
to	1
those	1
present	1
and	1
said:	1
“That	1
your	1
worships	1
may	1
see	1
how	1
important	1
it	1
is	1
to	1
have	1
knights-errant	1
to	1
redress	1
the	1
wrongs	1
and	1
injuries	1
done	1
by	1
tyrannical	1
and	1
wicked	1
men	1
in	1
this	1
world,	1
I	1
may	1
tell	1
you	1
that	1
some	1
days	1
ago	1
passing	1
through	1
a	1
wood,	1
I	1
heard	1
cries	1
and	1
piteous	1
complaints	1
as	1
of	1
a	1
person	1
in	1
pain	1
and	1
distress;	1
I	1
immediately	1
hastened,	1
impelled	1
by	1
my	1
bounden	1
duty,	1
to	1
the	1
quarter	1
whence	1
the	1
plaintive	1
accents	1
seemed	1
to	1
me	1
to	1
proceed,	1
and	1
I	1
found	1
tied	1
to	1
an	1
oak	1
this	1
lad	1
who	1
now	1
stands	1
before	1
you,	1
which	1
in	1
my	1
heart	1
I	1
rejoice	1
at,	1
for	1
his	1
testimony	1
will	1
not	1
permit	1
me	1
to	1
depart	1
from	1
the	1
truth	1
in	1
any	1
particular.	1
He	1
was,	1
I	1
say,	1
tied	1
to	1
an	1
oak,	1
naked	1
from	1
the	1
waist	1
up,	1
and	1
a	1
clown,	1
whom	1
I	1
afterwards	1
found	1
to	1
be	1
his	1
master,	1
was	1
scarifying	1
him	1
by	1
lashes	1
with	1
the	1
reins	1
of	1
his	1
mare.	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
I	1
saw	1
him	1
I	1
asked	1
the	1
reason	1
of	1
so	1
cruel	1
a	1
flagellation.	1
The	1
boor	1
replied	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
flogging	1
him	1
because	1
he	1
was	1
his	1
servant	1
and	1
because	1
of	1
carelessness	1
that	1
proceeded	1
rather	1
from	1
dishonesty	1
than	1
stupidity;	1
on	1
which	1
this	1
boy	1
said,	1
‘Señor,	1
he	1
flogs	1
me	1
only	1
because	1
I	1
ask	1
for	1
my	1
wages.’	1
The	1
master	1
made	1
I	1
know	1
not	1
what	1
speeches	1
and	1
explanations,	1
which,	1
though	1
I	1
listened	1
to	1
them,	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
accept.	1
In	1
short,	1
I	1
compelled	1
the	1
clown	1
to	1
unbind	1
him,	1
and	1
to	1
swear	1
he	1
would	1
take	1
him	1
with	1
him,	1
and	1
pay	1
him	1
real	1
by	1
real,	1
and	1
perfumed	1
into	1
the	1
bargain.	1
Is	1
not	1
all	1
this	1
true,	1
Andres	1
my	1
son?	1
Didst	1
thou	1
not	1
mark	1
with	1
what	1
authority	1
I	1
commanded	1
him,	1
and	1
with	1
what	1
humility	1
he	1
promised	1
to	1
do	1
all	1
I	1
enjoined,	1
specified,	1
and	1
required	1
of	1
him?	1
Answer	1
without	1
hesitation;	1
tell	1
these	1
gentlemen	1
what	1
took	1
place,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
see	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
as	1
great	1
an	1
advantage	1
as	1
I	1
say	1
to	1
have	1
knights-errant	1
abroad.”	1
“All	1
that	1
your	1
worship	1
has	1
said	1
is	1
quite	1
true,”	1
answered	1
the	1
lad;	1
“but	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
business	1
turned	1
out	1
just	1
the	1
opposite	1
of	1
what	1
your	1
worship	1
supposes.”	1
“How!	1
the	1
opposite?”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
“did	1
not	1
the	1
clown	1
pay	1
thee	1
then?”	1
“Not	1
only	1
did	1
he	1
not	1
pay	1
me,”	1
replied	1
the	1
lad,	1
“but	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
your	1
worship	1
had	1
passed	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
wood	1
and	1
we	1
were	1
alone,	1
he	1
tied	1
me	1
up	1
again	1
to	1
the	1
same	1
oak	1
and	1
gave	1
me	1
a	1
fresh	1
flogging,	1
that	1
left	1
me	1
like	1
a	1
flayed	1
Saint	1
Bartholomew;	1
and	1
every	1
stroke	1
he	1
gave	1
me	1
he	1
followed	1
up	1
with	1
some	1
jest	1
or	1
gibe	1
about	1
having	1
made	1
a	1
fool	1
of	1
your	1
worship,	1
and	1
but	1
for	1
the	1
pain	1
I	1
was	1
suffering	1
I	1
should	1
have	1
laughed	1
at	1
the	1
things	1
he	1
said.	1
In	1
short	1
he	1
left	1
me	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
condition	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
until	1
now	1
in	1
a	1
hospital	1
getting	1
cured	1
of	1
the	1
injuries	1
which	1
that	1
rascally	1
clown	1
inflicted	1
on	1
me	1
then;	1
for	1
all	1
which	1
your	1
worship	1
is	1
to	1
blame;	1
for	1
if	1
you	1
had	1
gone	1
your	1
own	1
way	1
and	1
not	1
come	1
where	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
call	1
for	1
you,	1
nor	1
meddled	1
in	1
other	1
people’s	1
affairs,	1
my	1
master	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
content	1
with	1
giving	1
me	1
one	1
or	1
two	1
dozen	1
lashes,	1
and	1
would	1
have	1
then	1
loosed	1
me	1
and	1
paid	1
me	1
what	1
he	1
owed	1
me;	1
but	1
when	1
your	1
worship	1
abused	1
him	1
so	1
out	1
of	1
measure,	1
and	1
gave	1
him	1
so	1
many	1
hard	1
words,	1
his	1
anger	1
was	1
kindled;	1
and	1
as	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
revenge	1
himself	1
on	1
you,	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
saw	1
you	1
had	1
left	1
him	1
the	1
storm	1
burst	1
upon	1
me	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
way,	1
that	1
I	1
feel	1
as	1
if	1
I	1
should	1
never	1
be	1
a	1
man	1
again.”	1
“The	1
mischief,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“lay	1
in	1
my	1
going	1
away;	1
for	1
I	1
should	1
not	1
have	1
gone	1
until	1
I	1
had	1
seen	1
thee	1
paid;	1
because	1
I	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
known	1
well	1
by	1
long	1
experience	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
clown	1
who	1
will	1
keep	1
his	1
word	1
if	1
he	1
finds	1
it	1
will	1
not	1
suit	1
him	1
to	1
keep	1
it;	1
but	1
thou	1
rememberest,	1
Andres,	1
that	1
I	1
swore	1
if	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
pay	1
thee	1
I	1
would	1
go	1
and	1
seek	1
him,	1
and	1
find	1
him	1
though	1
he	1
were	1
to	1
hide	1
himself	1
in	1
the	1
whale’s	1
belly.”	1
“That	1
is	1
true,”	1
said	1
Andres;	1
“but	1
it	1
was	1
of	1
no	1
use.”	1
“Thou	1
shalt	1
see	1
now	1
whether	1
it	1
is	1
of	1
use	1
or	1
not,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
and	1
so	1
saying,	1
he	1
got	1
up	1
hastily	1
and	1
bade	1
Sancho	1
bridle	1
Rocinante,	1
who	1
was	1
browsing	1
while	1
they	1
were	1
eating.	1
Dorothea	1
asked	1
him	1
what	1
he	1
meant	1
to	1
do.	1
He	1
replied	1
that	1
he	1
meant	1
to	1
go	1
in	1
search	1
of	1
this	1
clown	1
and	1
chastise	1
him	1
for	1
such	1
iniquitous	1
conduct,	1
and	1
see	1
Andres	1
paid	1
to	1
the	1
last	1
maravedi,	1
despite	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
teeth	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
clowns	1
in	1
the	1
world.	1
To	1
which	1
she	1
replied	1
that	1
he	1
must	1
remember	1
that	1
in	1
accordance	1
with	1
his	1
promise	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
engage	1
in	1
any	1
enterprise	1
until	1
he	1
had	1
concluded	1
hers;	1
and	1
that	1
as	1
he	1
knew	1
this	1
better	1
than	1
anyone,	1
he	1
should	1
restrain	1
his	1
ardour	1
until	1
his	1
return	1
from	1
her	1
kingdom.	1
“That	1
is	1
true,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“and	1
Andres	1
must	1
have	1
patience	1
until	1
my	1
return	1
as	1
you	1
say,	1
señora;	1
but	1
I	1
once	1
more	1
swear	1
and	1
promise	1
not	1
to	1
stop	1
until	1
I	1
have	1
seen	1
him	1
avenged	1
and	1
paid.”	1
“I	1
have	1
no	1
faith	1
in	1
those	1
oaths,”	1
said	1
Andres;	1
“I	1
would	1
rather	1
have	1
now	1
something	1
to	1
help	1
me	1
to	1
get	1
to	1
Seville	1
than	1
all	1
the	1
revenges	1
in	1
the	1
world;	1
if	1
you	1
have	1
here	1
anything	1
to	1
eat	1
that	1
I	1
can	1
take	1
with	1
me,	1
give	1
it	1
me,	1
and	1
God	1
be	1
with	1
your	1
worship	1
and	1
all	1
knights-errant;	1
and	1
may	1
their	1
errands	1
turn	1
out	1
as	1
well	1
for	1
themselves	1
as	1
they	1
have	1
for	1
me.”	1
Sancho	1
took	1
out	1
from	1
his	1
store	1
a	1
piece	1
of	1
bread	1
and	1
another	1
of	1
cheese,	1
and	1
giving	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
lad	1
he	1
said,	1
“Here,	1
take	1
this,	1
brother	1
Andres,	1
for	1
we	1
have	1
all	1
of	1
us	1
a	1
share	1
in	1
your	1
misfortune.”	1
“Why,	1
what	1
share	1
have	1
you	1
got?”	1
“This	1
share	1
of	1
bread	1
and	1
cheese	1
I	1
am	1
giving	1
you,”	1
answered	1
Sancho;	1
“and	1
God	1
knows	1
whether	1
I	1
shall	1
feel	1
the	1
want	1
of	1
it	1
myself	1
or	1
not;	1
for	1
I	1
would	1
have	1
you	1
know,	1
friend,	1
that	1
we	1
squires	1
to	1
knights-errant	1
have	1
to	1
bear	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
of	1
hunger	1
and	1
hard	1
fortune,	1
and	1
even	1
other	1
things	1
more	1
easily	1
felt	1
than	1
told.”	1
Andres	1
seized	1
his	1
bread	1
and	1
cheese,	1
and	1
seeing	1
that	1
nobody	1
gave	1
him	1
anything	1
more,	1
bent	1
his	1
head,	1
and	1
took	1
hold	1
of	1
the	1
road,	1
as	1
the	1
saying	1
is.	1
However,	1
before	1
leaving	1
he	1
said,	1
“For	1
the	1
love	1
of	1
God,	1
sir	1
knight-errant,	1
if	1
you	1
ever	1
meet	1
me	1
again,	1
though	1
you	1
may	1
see	1
them	1
cutting	1
me	1
to	1
pieces,	1
give	1
me	1
no	1
aid	1
or	1
succour,	1
but	1
leave	1
me	1
to	1
my	1
misfortune,	1
which	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
so	1
great	1
but	1
that	1
a	1
greater	1
will	1
come	1
to	1
me	1
by	1
being	1
helped	1
by	1
your	1
worship,	1
on	1
whom	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
knights-errant	1
that	1
have	1
ever	1
been	1
born	1
God	1
send	1
his	1
curse.”	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
was	1
getting	1
up	1
to	1
chastise	1
him,	1
but	1
he	1
took	1
to	1
his	1
heels	1
at	1
such	1
a	1
pace	1
that	1
no	1
one	1
attempted	1
to	1
follow	1
him;	1
and	1
mightily	1
chapfallen	1
was	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
at	1
Andres’	1
story,	1
and	1
the	1
others	1
had	1
to	1
take	1
great	1
care	1
to	1
restrain	1
their	1
laughter	1
so	1
as	1
not	1
to	1
put	1
him	1
entirely	1
out	1
of	1
countenance.	1

c32a.jpg	1
(132K)	1
Full	1
Size	1
Their	1
dainty	1
repast	1
being	1
finished,	1
they	1
saddled	1
at	1
once,	1
and	1
without	1
any	1
adventure	1
worth	1
mentioning	1
they	1
reached	1
next	1
day	1
the	1
inn,	1
the	1
object	1
of	1
Sancho	1
Panza’s	1
fear	1
and	1
dread;	1
but	1
though	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
rather	1
not	1
entered	1
it,	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
help	1
for	1
it.	1
The	1
landlady,	1
the	1
landlord,	1
their	1
daughter,	1
and	1
Maritornes,	1
when	1
they	1
saw	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
and	1
Sancho	1
coming,	1
went	1
out	1
to	1
welcome	1
them	1
with	1
signs	1
of	1
hearty	1
satisfaction,	1
which	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
received	1
with	1
dignity	1
and	1
gravity,	1
and	1
bade	1
them	1
make	1
up	1
a	1
better	1
bed	1
for	1
him	1
than	1
the	1
last	1
time:	1
to	1
which	1
the	1
landlady	1
replied	1
that	1
if	1
he	1
paid	1
better	1
than	1
he	1
did	1
the	1
last	1
time	1
she	1
would	1
give	1
him	1
one	1
fit	1
for	1
a	1
prince.	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
said	1
he	1
would,	1
so	1
they	1
made	1
up	1
a	1
tolerable	1
one	1
for	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
garret	1
as	1
before;	1
and	1
he	1
lay	1
down	1
at	1
once,	1
being	1
sorely	1
shaken	1
and	1
in	1
want	1
of	1
sleep.	1
No	1
sooner	1
was	1
the	1
door	1
shut	1
upon	1
him	1
than	1
the	1
landlady	1
made	1
at	1
the	1
barber,	1
and	1
seizing	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
beard,	1
said:	1
“By	1
my	1
faith	1
you	1
are	1
not	1
going	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
beard	1
of	1
my	1
tail	1
any	1
longer;	1
you	1
must	1
give	1
me	1
back	1
my	1
tail,	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
shame	1
the	1
way	1
that	1
thing	1
of	1
my	1
husband’s	1
goes	1
tossing	1
about	1
on	1
the	1
floor;	1
I	1
mean	1
the	1
comb	1
that	1
I	1
used	1
to	1
stick	1
in	1
my	1
good	1
tail.”	1
But	1
for	1
all	1
she	1
tugged	1
at	1
it	1
the	1
barber	1
would	1
not	1
give	1
it	1
up	1
until	1
the	1
licentiate	1
told	1
him	1
to	1
let	1
her	1
have	1
it,	1
as	1
there	1
was	1
now	1
no	1
further	1
occasion	1
for	1
that	1
stratagem,	1
because	1
he	1
might	1
declare	1
himself	1
and	1
appear	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
character,	1
and	1
tell	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
fled	1
to	1
this	1
inn	1
when	1
those	1
thieves	1
the	1
galley	1
slaves	1
robbed	1
him;	1
and	1
should	1
he	1
ask	1
for	1
the	1
princess’s	1
squire,	1
they	1
could	1
tell	1
him	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
sent	1
him	1
on	1
before	1
her	1
to	1
give	1
notice	1
to	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
her	1
kingdom	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
coming,	1
and	1
bringing	1
with	1
her	1
the	1
deliverer	1
of	1
them	1
all.	1
On	1
this	1
the	1
barber	1
cheerfully	1
restored	1
the	1
tail	1
to	1
the	1
landlady,	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
they	1
returned	1
all	1
the	1
accessories	1
they	1
had	1
borrowed	1
to	1
effect	1
Don	1
Quixote’s	1
deliverance.	1
All	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
inn	1
were	1
struck	1
with	1
astonishment	1
at	1
the	1
beauty	1
of	1
Dorothea,	1
and	1
even	1
at	1
the	1
comely	1
figure	1
of	1
the	1
shepherd	1
Cardenio.	1
The	1
curate	1
made	1
them	1
get	1
ready	1
such	1
fare	1
as	1
there	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
inn,	1
and	1
the	1
landlord,	1
in	1
hope	1
of	1
better	1
payment,	1
served	1
them	1
up	1
a	1
tolerably	1
good	1
dinner.	1
All	1
this	1
time	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
was	1
asleep,	1
and	1
they	1
thought	1
it	1
best	1
not	1
to	1
waken	1
him,	1
as	1
sleeping	1
would	1
now	1
do	1
him	1
more	1
good	1
than	1
eating.	1
While	1
at	1
dinner,	1
the	1
company	1
consisting	1
of	1
the	1
landlord,	1
his	1
wife,	1
their	1
daughter,	1
Maritornes,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
travellers,	1
they	1
discussed	1
the	1
strange	1
craze	1
of	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
and	1
the	1
manner	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
found;	1
and	1
the	1
landlady	1
told	1
them	1
what	1
had	1
taken	1
place	1
between	1
him	1
and	1
the	1
carrier;	1
and	1
then,	1
looking	1
round	1
to	1
see	1
if	1
Sancho	1
was	1
there,	1
when	1
she	1
saw	1
he	1
was	1
not,	1
she	1
gave	1
them	1
the	1
whole	1
story	1
of	1
his	1
blanketing,	1
which	1
they	1
received	1
with	1
no	1
little	1
amusement.	1
But	1
on	1
the	1
curate	1
observing	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
books	1
of	1
chivalry	1
which	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
had	1
read	1
that	1
had	1
turned	1
his	1
brain,	1
the	1
landlord	1
said:	1
“I	1
cannot	1
understand	1
how	1
that	1
can	1
be,	1
for	1
in	1
truth	1
to	1
my	1
mind	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
better	1
reading	1
in	1
the	1
world,	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
here	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
of	1
them,	1
with	1
other	1
writings	1
that	1
are	1
the	1
very	1
life,	1
not	1
only	1
of	1
myself	1
but	1
of	1
plenty	1
more;	1
for	1
when	1
it	1
is	1
harvest-time,	1
the	1
reapers	1
flock	1
here	1
on	1
holidays,	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
always	1
one	1
among	1
them	1
who	1
can	1
read	1
and	1
who	1
takes	1
up	1
one	1
of	1
these	1
books,	1
and	1
we	1
gather	1
round	1
him,	1
thirty	1
or	1
more	1
of	1
us,	1
and	1
stay	1
listening	1
to	1
him	1
with	1
a	1
delight	1
that	1
makes	1
our	1
grey	1
hairs	1
grow	1
young	1
again.	1
At	1
least	1
I	1
can	1
say	1
for	1
myself	1
that	1
when	1
I	1
hear	1
of	1
what	1
furious	1
and	1
terrible	1
blows	1
the	1
knights	1
deliver,	1
I	1
am	1
seized	1
with	1
the	1
longing	1
to	1
do	1
the	1
same,	1
and	1
I	1
would	1
like	1
to	1
be	1
hearing	1
about	1
them	1
night	1
and	1
day.”	1
“And	1
I	1
just	1
as	1
much,”	1
said	1
the	1
landlady,	1
“because	1
I	1
never	1
have	1
a	1
quiet	1
moment	1
in	1
my	1
house	1
except	1
when	1
you	1
are	1
listening	1
to	1
someone	1
reading;	1
for	1
then	1
you	1
are	1
so	1
taken	1
up	1
that	1
for	1
the	1
time	1
being	1
you	1
forget	1
to	1
scold.”	1
“That	1
is	1
true,”	1
said	1
Maritornes;	1
“and,	1
faith,	1
I	1
relish	1
hearing	1
these	1
things	1
greatly	1
too,	1
for	1
they	1
are	1
very	1
pretty;	1
especially	1
when	1
they	1
describe	1
some	1
lady	1
or	1
another	1
in	1
the	1
arms	1
of	1
her	1
knight	1
under	1
the	1
orange	1
trees,	1
and	1
the	1
duenna	1
who	1
is	1
keeping	1
watch	1
for	1
them	1
half	1
dead	1
with	1
envy	1
and	1
fright;	1
all	1
this	1
I	1
say	1
is	1
as	1
good	1
as	1
honey.”	1
“And	1
you,	1
what	1
do	1
you	1
think,	1
young	1
lady?”	1
said	1
the	1
curate	1
turning	1
to	1
the	1
landlord’s	1
daughter.	1
“I	1
don’t	1
know	1
indeed,	1
señor,”	1
said	1
she;	1
“I	1
listen	1
too,	1
and	1
to	1
tell	1
the	1
truth,	1
though	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
understand	1
it,	1
I	1
like	1
hearing	1
it;	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
the	1
blows	1
that	1
my	1
father	1
likes	1
that	1
I	1
like,	1
but	1
the	1
laments	1
the	1
knights	1
utter	1
when	1
they	1
are	1
separated	1
from	1
their	1
ladies;	1
and	1
indeed	1
they	1
sometimes	1
make	1
me	1
weep	1
with	1
the	1
pity	1
I	1
feel	1
for	1
them.”	1
“Then	1
you	1
would	1
console	1
them	1
if	1
it	1
was	1
for	1
you	1
they	1
wept,	1
young	1
lady?”	1
said	1
Dorothea.	1
“I	1
don’t	1
know	1
what	1
I	1
should	1
do,”	1
said	1
the	1
girl;	1
“I	1
only	1
know	1
that	1
there	1
are	1
some	1
of	1
those	1
ladies	1
so	1
cruel	1
that	1
they	1
call	1
their	1
knights	1
tigers	1
and	1
lions	1
and	1
a	1
thousand	1
other	1
foul	1
names:	1
and	1
Jesus!	1
I	1
don’t	1
know	1
what	1
sort	1
of	1
folk	1
they	1
can	1
be,	1
so	1
unfeeling	1
and	1
heartless,	1
that	1
rather	1
than	1
bestow	1
a	1
glance	1
upon	1
a	1
worthy	1
man	1
they	1
leave	1
him	1
to	1
die	1
or	1
go	1
mad.	1
I	1
don’t	1
know	1
what	1
is	1
the	1
good	1
of	1
such	1
prudery;	1
if	1
it	1
is	1
for	1
honour’s	1
sake,	1
why	1
not	1
marry	1
them?	1
That’s	1
all	1
they	1
want.”	1
“Hush,	1
child,”	1
said	1
the	1
landlady;	1
“it	1
seems	1
to	1
me	1
thou	1
knowest	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
about	1
these	1
things,	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
fit	1
for	1
girls	1
to	1
know	1
or	1
talk	1
so	1
much.”	1
“As	1
the	1
gentleman	1
asked	1
me,	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
answering	1
him,”	1
said	1
the	1
girl.	1
“Well	1
then,”	1
said	1
the	1
curate,	1
“bring	1
me	1
these	1
books,	1
señor	1
landlord,	1
for	1
I	1
should	1
like	1
to	1
see	1
them.”	1
“With	1
all	1
my	1
heart,”	1
said	1
he,	1
and	1
going	1
into	1
his	1
own	1
room	1
he	1
brought	1
out	1
an	1
old	1
valise	1
secured	1
with	1
a	1
little	1
chain,	1
on	1
opening	1
which	1
the	1
curate	1
found	1
in	1
it	1
three	1
large	1
books	1
and	1
some	1
manuscripts	1
written	1
in	1
a	1
very	1
good	1
hand.	1
The	1
first	1
that	1
he	1
opened	1
he	1
found	1
to	1
be	1
“Don	1
Cirongilio	1
of	1
Thrace,”	1
and	1
the	1
second	1
“Don	1
Felixmarte	1
of	1
Hircania,”	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
the	1
“History	1
of	1
the	1
Great	1
Captain	1
Gonzalo	1
Hernandez	1
de	1
Cordova,	1
with	1
the	1
Life	1
of	1
Diego	1
García	1
de	1
Paredes.”	1
When	1
the	1
curate	1
read	1
the	1
two	1
first	1
titles	1
he	1
looked	1
over	1
at	1
the	1
barber	1
and	1
said,	1
“We	1
want	1
my	1
friend’s	1
housekeeper	1
and	1
niece	1
here	1
now.”	1
“Nay,”	1
said	1
the	1
barber,	1
“I	1
can	1
do	1
just	1
as	1
well	1
to	1
carry	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
yard	1
or	1
to	1
the	1
hearth,	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
very	1
good	1
fire	1
there.”	1
“What!	1
your	1
worship	1
would	1
burn	1
my	1
books!”	1
said	1
the	1
landlord.	1
“Only	1
these	1
two,”	1
said	1
the	1
curate,	1
“Don	1
Cirongilio,	1
and	1
Felixmarte.”	1
“Are	1
my	1
books,	1
then,	1
heretics	1
or	1
phlegmatics	1
that	1
you	1
want	1
to	1
burn	1
them?”	1
said	1
the	1
landlord.	1
“Schismatics	1
you	1
mean,	1
friend,”	1
said	1
the	1
barber,	1
“not	1
phlegmatics.”	1
“That’s	1
it,”	1
said	1
the	1
landlord;	1
“but	1
if	1
you	1
want	1
to	1
burn	1
any,	1
let	1
it	1
be	1
that	1
about	1
the	1
Great	1
Captain	1
and	1
that	1
Diego	1
García;	1
for	1
I	1
would	1
rather	1
have	1
a	1
child	1
of	1
mine	1
burnt	1
than	1
either	1
of	1
the	1
others.”	1
“Brother,”	1
said	1
the	1
curate,	1
“those	1
two	1
books	1
are	1
made	1
up	1
of	1
lies,	1
and	1
are	1
full	1
of	1
folly	1
and	1
nonsense;	1
but	1
this	1
of	1
the	1
Great	1
Captain	1
is	1
a	1
true	1
history,	1
and	1
contains	1
the	1
deeds	1
of	1
Gonzalo	1
Hernandez	1
of	1
Cordova,	1
who	1
by	1
his	1
many	1
and	1
great	1
achievements	1
earned	1
the	1
title	1
all	1
over	1
the	1
world	1
of	1
the	1
Great	1
Captain,	1
a	1
famous	1
and	1
illustrious	1
name,	1
and	1
deserved	1
by	1
him	1
alone;	1
and	1
this	1
Diego	1
García	1
de	1
Paredes	1
was	1
a	1
distinguished	1
knight	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
Trujillo	1
in	1
Estremadura,	1
a	1
most	1
gallant	1
soldier,	1
and	1
of	1
such	1
bodily	1
strength	1
that	1
with	1
one	1
finger	1
he	1
stopped	1
a	1
mill-wheel	1
in	1
full	1
motion;	1
and	1
posted	1
with	1
a	1
two-handed	1
sword	1
at	1
the	1
foot	1
of	1
a	1
bridge	1
he	1
kept	1
the	1
whole	1
of	1
an	1
immense	1
army	1
from	1
passing	1
over	1

“Tell	1
that	1
to	1
my	1
father,”	1
said	1
the	1
landlord.	1
“There’s	1
a	1
thing	1
to	1
be	1
astonished	1
at!	1
Stopping	1
a	1
mill-wheel!	1
By	1
God	1

I	1
have	1

of	1
Felixmarte	1
of	1
Hircania,	1
how	1
with	1
one	1
single	1
backstroke	1
he	1
cleft	1
five	1
giants	1
asunder	1
through	1
the	1

had	1
been	1
made	1
of	1
bean-pods	1

the	1
little	1
friars	1
the	1
children	1
make;	1
and	1
another	1
time	1
he	1
attacked	1
a	1
very	1
great	1
and	1
powerful	1
army,	1
in	1
which	1
there	1
were	1
more	1
than	1
a	1
million	1
six	1
hundred	1
thousand	1
soldiers,	1
all	1
armed	1
from	1
head	1

foot,	1

he	1
routed	1
them	1
all	1
as	1

they	1
had	1
been	1
flocks	1
of	1
sheep.”	1

“And	1
then,	1
what	1
do	1
you	1
say	1
to	1
the	1
good	1
Cirongilio	1
of	1
Thrace,	1
that	1
was	1
so	1
stout	1
and	1
bold;	1
as	1
may	1
be	1
seen	1
in	1
the	1
book,	1
where	1
it	1
is	1
related	1
that	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
sailing	1
along	1

there	1
came	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
the	1

of	1
the	1

against	1
him	1
a	1
fiery	1
serpent,	1

he,	1

soon	1
as	1
he	1

it,	1
flung	1
himself	1
upon	1
it	1
and	1
got	1
astride	1
of	1
its	1
scaly	1
shoulders,	1
and	1
squeezed	1
its	1
throat	1
with	1
both	1
hands	1
with	1
such	1
force	1
that	1
the	1
serpent,	1
finding	1
he	1
was	1
throttling	1
it,	1
had	1
nothing	1
for	1
it	1
but	1
to	1
let	1
itself	1
sink	1
to	1
the	1
bottom	1
of	1
the	1
river,	1
carrying	1
with	1
it	1
the	1
knight	1
who	1
would	1
not	1
let	1
go	1
his	1
hold;	1
and	1
when	1
they	1
got	1
down	1
there	1
he	1
found	1
himself	1
among	1
palaces	1
and	1
gardens	1
so	1
pretty	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
wonder	1
to	1
see;	1
and	1
then	1
the	1
serpent	1
changed	1
itself	1
into	1
an	1
old	1
ancient	1
man,	1
who	1
told	1
him	1
such	1
things	1
as	1
were	1
never	1

Hold	1
your	1
peace,	1
señor;	1
for	1
if	1
you	1
were	1
to	1
hear	1
this	1
you	1
would	1
go	1
mad	1
with	1
delight.	1
A	1
couple	1
of	1
figs	1
for	1
your	1
Great	1
Captain	1
and	1
your	1
Diego	1
García!”	1
Hearing	1
this	1
Dorothea	1
said	1
in	1
a	1
whisper	1
to	1
Cardenio,	1
“Our	1
landlord	1
is	1
almost	1
fit	1
to	1
play	1
a	1
second	1
part	1
to	1
Don	1
Quixote.”	1
“I	1
think	1
so,”	1
said	1
Cardenio,	1
“for,	1
as	1
he	1
shows,	1
he	1
accepts	1
it	1
as	1
a	1
certainty	1
that	1
everything	1
those	1
books	1
relate	1
took	1
place	1
exactly	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
written	1
down;	1
and	1
the	1
barefooted	1
friars	1
themselves	1
would	1
not	1
persuade	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
contrary.”	1
“But	1
consider,	1
brother,”	1
said	1
the	1
curate	1
once	1
more,	1
“there	1
never	1
was	1
any	1
Felixmarte	1
of	1
Hircania	1
in	1
the	1
world,	1
nor	1
any	1
Cirongilio	1
of	1
Thrace,	1
or	1
any	1
of	1
the	1
other	1
knights	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
sort,	1
that	1
the	1
books	1
of	1
chivalry	1
talk	1
of;	1
the	1
whole	1
thing	1
is	1
the	1
fabrication	1
and	1
invention	1
of	1
idle	1
wits,	1
devised	1
by	1
them	1
for	1
the	1
purpose	1
you	1
describe	1
of	1
beguiling	1
the	1
time,	1
as	1
your	1
reapers	1
do	1
when	1
they	1
read;	1
for	1
I	1
swear	1
to	1
you	1
in	1
all	1
seriousness	1
there	1
never	1
were	1
any	1
such	1
knights	1
in	1
the	1
world,	1
and	1
no	1
such	1
exploits	1
or	1
nonsense	1
ever	1
happened	1
anywhere.”	1
“Try	1
that	1
bone	1
on	1
another	1
dog,”	1
said	1
the	1
landlord;	1
“as	1
if	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
how	1
many	1
make	1
five,	1
and	1
where	1
my	1
shoe	1
pinches	1
me;	1
don’t	1
think	1
to	1
feed	1
me	1
with	1
pap,	1
for	1
by	1
God	1
I	1
am	1
no	1
fool.	1
It	1
is	1
a	1
good	1
joke	1
for	1
your	1
worship	1
to	1
try	1
and	1
persuade	1
me	1
that	1
everything	1
these	1
good	1
books	1
say	1
is	1
nonsense	1
and	1
lies,	1
and	1
they	1
printed	1
by	1
the	1
license	1
of	1
the	1
Lords	1
of	1
the	1
Royal	1
Council,	1
as	1
if	1
they	1
were	1
people	1
who	1
would	1
allow	1
such	1
a	1
lot	1
of	1
lies	1
to	1
be	1
printed	1
all	1
together,	1
and	1
so	1
many	1
battles	1
and	1
enchantments	1
that	1
they	1
take	1
away	1
one’s	1
senses.”	1
“I	1
have	1
told	1
you,	1
friend,”	1
said	1
the	1
curate,	1
“that	1
this	1
is	1
done	1
to	1
divert	1
our	1
idle	1
thoughts;	1
and	1
as	1
in	1
well-ordered	1
states	1
games	1
of	1
chess,	1
fives,	1
and	1
billiards	1
are	1
allowed	1
for	1
the	1
diversion	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
do	1
not	1
care,	1
or	1
are	1
not	1
obliged,	1
or	1
are	1
unable	1
to	1
work,	1
so	1
books	1
of	1
this	1
kind	1
are	1
allowed	1
to	1
be	1
printed,	1
on	1
the	1
supposition	1
that,	1
what	1
indeed	1
is	1
the	1
truth,	1
there	1
can	1
be	1
nobody	1
so	1
ignorant	1
as	1
to	1
take	1
any	1
of	1
them	1
for	1
true	1
stories;	1
and	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
permitted	1
me	1
now,	1
and	1
the	1
present	1
company	1
desired	1
it,	1
I	1
could	1
say	1
something	1
about	1
the	1
qualities	1
books	1
of	1
chivalry	1
should	1
possess	1
to	1
be	1
good	1
ones,	1
that	1
would	1
be	1
to	1
the	1
advantage	1
and	1
even	1
to	1
the	1
taste	1
of	1
some;	1
but	1
I	1
hope	1
the	1
time	1
will	1
come	1
when	1
I	1
can	1
communicate	1
my	1
ideas	1
to	1
someone	1
who	1
may	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
mend	1
matters;	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
meantime,	1
señor	1
landlord,	1
believe	1
what	1
I	1
have	1
said,	1
and	1
take	1
your	1
books,	1
and	1
make	1
up	1
your	1
mind	1
about	1
their	1
truth	1
or	1
falsehood,	1
and	1
much	1
good	1
may	1
they	1
do	1
you;	1
and	1
God	1
grant	1
you	1
may	1
not	1
fall	1
lame	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
foot	1
your	1
guest	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
halts	1
on.”	1
“No	1
fear	1
of	1
that,”	1
returned	1
the	1
landlord;	1
“I	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
so	1
mad	1
as	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
knight-errant	1
of	1
myself;	1
for	1
I	1
see	1
well	1
enough	1
that	1
things	1
are	1
not	1
now	1
as	1
they	1
used	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
those	1
days,	1
when	1
they	1
say	1
those	1
famous	1
knights	1
roamed	1
about	1
the	1
world.”	1
Sancho	1
had	1
made	1
his	1
appearance	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
this	1
conversation,	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
very	1
much	1
troubled	1
and	1
cast	1
down	1
by	1
what	1
he	1
heard	1
said	1
about	1
knights-errant	1
being	1
now	1
no	1
longer	1
in	1
vogue,	1
and	1
all	1
books	1
of	1
chivalry	1
being	1
folly	1
and	1
lies;	1
and	1
he	1
resolved	1
in	1
his	1
heart	1
to	1
wait	1
and	1
see	1
what	1
came	1
of	1
this	1
journey	1
of	1
his	1
master’s,	1
and	1
if	1
it	1
did	1
not	1
turn	1
out	1
as	1
happily	1
as	1
his	1
master	1
expected,	1
he	1
determined	1
to	1
leave	1
him	1
and	1
go	1
back	1
to	1
his	1
wife	1
and	1
children	1
and	1
his	1
ordinary	1
labour.	1
The	1
landlord	1
was	1
carrying	1
away	1
the	1
valise	1
and	1
the	1
books,	1
but	1
the	1
curate	1
said	1
to	1
him,	1
“Wait;	1
I	1
want	1
to	1
see	1
what	1
those	1
papers	1
are	1
that	1
are	1
written	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
good	1
hand.”	1
The	1
landlord	1
taking	1
them	1
out	1
handed	1
them	1
to	1
him	1
to	1
read,	1
and	1
he	1
perceived	1
they	1
were	1
a	1
work	1
of	1
about	1
eight	1
sheets	1
of	1
manuscript,	1
with,	1
in	1
large	1
letters	1
at	1
the	1
beginning,	1
the	1
title	1
of	1
“Novel	1
of	1
the	1
Ill-advised	1
Curiosity.”	1
The	1
curate	1
read	1
three	1
or	1
four	1
lines	1
to	1
himself,	1
and	1
said,	1
“I	1
must	1
say	1
the	1
title	1
of	1
this	1
novel	1
does	1
not	1
seem	1
to	1
me	1
a	1
bad	1
one,	1
and	1
I	1
feel	1
an	1
inclination	1
to	1
read	1
it	1
all.”	1
To	1
which	1
the	1
landlord	1
replied,	1
“Then	1
your	1
reverence	1
will	1
do	1
well	1
to	1
read	1
it,	1
for	1
I	1
can	1
tell	1
you	1
that	1
some	1
guests	1
who	1
have	1
read	1
it	1
here	1
have	1
been	1
much	1
pleased	1
with	1
it,	1
and	1
have	1
begged	1
it	1
of	1
me	1
very	1
earnestly;	1
but	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
give	1
it,	1
meaning	1
to	1
return	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
person	1
who	1
forgot	1
the	1
valise,	1
books,	1
and	1
papers	1
here,	1
for	1
maybe	1
he	1
will	1
return	1
here	1
some	1
time	1
or	1
other;	1
and	1
though	1
I	1
know	1
I	1
shall	1
miss	1
the	1
books,	1
faith	1
I	1
mean	1
to	1
return	1
them;	1
for	1
though	1
I	1
am	1
an	1
innkeeper,	1
still	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
Christian.”	1
“You	1
are	1
very	1
right,	1
friend,”	1
said	1
the	1
curate;	1
“but	1
for	1
all	1
that,	1
if	1
the	1
novel	1
pleases	1
me	1
you	1
must	1
let	1
me	1
copy	1
it.”	1
“With	1
all	1
my	1
heart,”	1
replied	1
the	1
host.	1
While	1
they	1
were	1
talking	1
Cardenio	1
had	1
taken	1
up	1
the	1
novel	1
and	1
begun	1
to	1
read	1
it,	1
and	1
forming	1
the	1
same	1
opinion	1
of	1
it	1
as	1
the	1
curate,	1
he	1
begged	1
him	1
to	1
read	1
it	1
so	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
all	1
hear	1
it.	1
“I	1
would	1
read	1
it,”	1
said	1
the	1
curate,	1
“if	1
the	1
time	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
better	1
spent	1
in	1
sleeping.”	1
“It	1
will	1
be	1
rest	1
enough	1
for	1
me,”	1
said	1
Dorothea,	1
“to	1
while	1
away	1
the	1
time	1
by	1
listening	1
to	1
some	1
tale,	1
for	1
my	1
spirits	1
are	1
not	1
yet	1
tranquil	1
enough	1
to	1
let	1
me	1
sleep	1
when	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
seasonable.”	1
“Well	1
then,	1
in	1
that	1
case,”	1
said	1
the	1
curate,	1
“I	1
will	1
read	1
it,	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
only	1
out	1
of	1
curiosity;	1
perhaps	1
it	1
may	1
contain	1
something	1
pleasant.”	1
Master	1
Nicholas	1
added	1
his	1
entreaties	1
to	1
the	1
same	1
effect,	1
and	1
Sancho	1
too;	1
seeing	1
which,	1
and	1
considering	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
give	1
pleasure	1
to	1
all,	1
and	1
receive	1
it	1
himself,	1
the	1
curate	1
said,	1
“Well	1
then,	1
attend	1
to	1
me	1
everyone,	1
for	1
the	1
novel	1
begins	1
thus.”	1

CHAPTER	1
XXXIII.	1
IN	1
WHICH	1
IS	1
RELATED	1
THE	1
NOVEL	1
OF	1
“THE	1
ILL-ADVISED	1
CURIOSITY”	1
In	1
Florence,	1
a	1
rich	1
and	1
famous	1
city	1
of	1
Italy	1
in	1
the	1
province	1
called	1
Tuscany,	1
there	1
lived	1
two	1
gentlemen	1
of	1
wealth	1
and	1
quality,	1
Anselmo	1
and	1
Lothario,	1
such	1
great	1
friends	1
that	1
by	1
way	1
of	1
distinction	1
they	1
were	1
called	1
by	1
all	1
that	1
knew	1
them	1
“The	1
Two	1
Friends.”	1
They	1
were	1
unmarried,	1
young,	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
age	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
tastes,	1
which	1
was	1
enough	1
to	1
account	1
for	1
the	1
reciprocal	1
friendship	1
between	1
them.	1
Anselmo,	1
it	1
is	1
true,	1
was	1
somewhat	1
more	1
inclined	1
to	1
seek	1
pleasure	1
in	1
love	1
than	1
Lothario,	1
for	1
whom	1
the	1
pleasures	1
of	1
the	1
chase	1
had	1
more	1
attraction;	1
but	1
on	1
occasion	1
Anselmo	1
would	1
forego	1
his	1
own	1
tastes	1
to	1
yield	1
to	1
those	1
of	1
Lothario,	1
and	1
Lothario	1
would	1
surrender	1
his	1
to	1
fall	1
in	1
with	1
those	1
of	1
Anselmo,	1
and	1
in	1
this	1
way	1
their	1
inclinations	1
kept	1
pace	1
one	1
with	1
the	1
other	1
with	1
a	1
concord	1
so	1
perfect	1
that	1
the	1
best	1
regulated	1
clock	1
could	1
not	1
surpass	1
it.	1
Anselmo	1
was	1
deep	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
a	1
high-born	1
and	1
beautiful	1
maiden	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
city,	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
parents	1
so	1
estimable,	1
and	1
so	1
estimable	1
herself,	1
that	1
he	1
resolved,	1
with	1
the	1
approval	1
of	1
his	1
friend	1
Lothario,	1
without	1
whom	1
he	1
did	1
nothing,	1
to	1
ask	1
her	1
of	1
them	1
in	1
marriage,	1
and	1
did	1
so,	1
Lothario	1
being	1
the	1
bearer	1
of	1
the	1
demand,	1
and	1
conducting	1
the	1
negotiation	1
so	1
much	1
to	1
the	1
satisfaction	1
of	1
his	1
friend	1
that	1
in	1
a	1
short	1
time	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
possession	1
of	1
the	1
object	1
of	1
his	1
desires,	1
and	1
Camilla	1
so	1
happy	1
in	1
having	1
won	1
Anselmo	1
for	1
her	1
husband,	1
that	1
she	1
gave	1
thanks	1
unceasingly	1
to	1
heaven	1
and	1
to	1
Lothario,	1
by	1
whose	1
means	1
such	1
good	1
fortune	1
had	1
fallen	1
to	1
her.	1
The	1
first	1
few	1
days,	1
those	1
of	1
a	1
wedding	1
being	1
usually	1
days	1
of	1
merry-making,	1
Lothario	1
frequented	1
his	1
friend	1
Anselmo’s	1
house	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
wont,	1
striving	1
to	1
do	1
honour	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
occasion,	1
and	1
to	1
gratify	1
him	1
in	1
every	1
way	1
he	1
could;	1
but	1
when	1
the	1
wedding	1
days	1
were	1
over	1
and	1
the	1
succession	1
of	1
visits	1
and	1
congratulations	1
had	1
slackened,	1
he	1
began	1
purposely	1
to	1
leave	1
off	1
going	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
Anselmo,	1
for	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
him,	1
as	1
it	1
naturally	1
would	1
to	1
all	1
men	1
of	1
sense,	1
that	1
friends’	1
houses	1
ought	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
visited	1
after	1
marriage	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
frequency	1
as	1
in	1
their	1
masters’	1
bachelor	1
days:	1
because,	1
though	1
true	1
and	1
genuine	1
friendship	1
cannot	1
and	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
in	1
any	1
way	1
suspicious,	1
still	1
a	1
married	1
man’s	1
honour	1
is	1
a	1
thing	1
of	1
such	1
delicacy	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
held	1
liable	1
to	1
injury	1
from	1
brothers,	1
much	1
more	1
from	1
friends.	1
Anselmo	1
remarked	1
the	1
cessation	1
of	1
Lothario’s	1
visits,	1
and	1
complained	1
of	1
it	1
to	1
him,	1
saying	1
that	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
known	1
that	1
marriage	1
was	1
to	1
keep	1
him	1
from	1
enjoying	1
his	1
society	1
as	1
he	1
used,	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
never	1
married;	1
and	1
that,	1
if	1
by	1
the	1
thorough	1
harmony	1
that	1
subsisted	1
between	1
them	1
while	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
bachelor	1
they	1
had	1
earned	1
such	1
a	1
sweet	1
name	1
as	1
that	1
of	1
“The	1
Two	1
Friends,”	1
he	1
should	1
not	1
allow	1
a	1
title	1
so	1
rare	1
and	1
so	1
delightful	1
to	1
be	1
lost	1
through	1
a	1
needless	1
anxiety	1
to	1
act	1
circumspectly;	1
and	1
so	1
he	1
entreated	1
him,	1
if	1
such	1
a	1
phrase	1
was	1
allowable	1
between	1
them,	1
to	1
be	1
once	1
more	1
master	1
of	1
his	1
house	1
and	1
to	1
come	1
in	1
and	1
go	1
out	1
as	1
formerly,	1
assuring	1
him	1
that	1
his	1
wife	1
Camilla	1
had	1
no	1
other	1
desire	1
or	1
inclination	1
than	1
that	1
which	1
he	1
would	1
wish	1
her	1
to	1
have,	1
and	1
that	1
knowing	1
how	1
sincerely	1
they	1
loved	1
one	1
another	1
she	1
was	1
grieved	1
to	1
see	1
such	1
coldness	1
in	1
him.	1
To	1
all	1
this	1
and	1
much	1
more	1
that	1
Anselmo	1
said	1
to	1
Lothario	1
to	1
persuade	1
him	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
his	1
house	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
in	1
the	1
habit	1
of	1
doing,	1
Lothario	1
replied	1
with	1
so	1
much	1
prudence,	1
sense,	1
and	1
judgment,	1
that	1
Anselmo	1
was	1
satisfied	1
of	1
his	1
friend’s	1
good	1
intentions,	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
agreed	1
that	1
on	1
two	1
days	1
in	1
the	1
week,	1
and	1
on	1
holidays,	1
Lothario	1
should	1
come	1
to	1
dine	1
with	1
him;	1
but	1
though	1
this	1
arrangement	1
was	1
made	1
between	1
them	1
Lothario	1
resolved	1
to	1
observe	1
it	1
no	1
further	1
than	1
he	1
considered	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
accordance	1
with	1
the	1
honour	1
of	1
his	1
friend,	1
whose	1
good	1
name	1
was	1
more	1
to	1
him	1
than	1
his	1
own.	1
He	1
said,	1
and	1
justly,	1
that	1
a	1
married	1
man	1
upon	1
whom	1
heaven	1
had	1
bestowed	1
a	1
beautiful	1
wife	1
should	1
consider	1
as	1
carefully	1
what	1
friends	1
he	1
brought	1
to	1
his	1
house	1
as	1
what	1
female	1
friends	1
his	1
wife	1
associated	1
with,	1
for	1
what	1
cannot	1
be	1
done	1
or	1
arranged	1
in	1
the	1
market-place,	1
in	1
church,	1
at	1
public	1
festivals	1
or	1
at	1
stations	1
(opportunities	1
that	1
husbands	1
cannot	1
always	1
deny	1
their	1
wives),	1
may	1
be	1
easily	1
managed	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
female	1
friend	1
or	1
relative	1
in	1
whom	1
most	1
confidence	1
is	1
reposed.	1
Lothario	1
said,	1
too,	1
that	1
every	1
married	1
man	1
should	1
have	1
some	1
friend	1
who	1
would	1
point	1
out	1
to	1
him	1
any	1
negligence	1
he	1
might	1
be	1
guilty	1
of	1
in	1
his	1
conduct,	1
for	1
it	1
will	1
sometimes	1
happen	1
that	1
owing	1
to	1
the	1
deep	1
affection	1
the	1
husband	1
bears	1
his	1
wife	1
either	1
he	1
does	1
not	1
caution	1
her,	1
or,	1
not	1
to	1
vex	1
her,	1
refrains	1
from	1
telling	1
her	1
to	1
do	1
or	1
not	1
to	1
do	1
certain	1
things,	1
doing	1
or	1
avoiding	1
which	1
may	1
be	1
a	1
matter	1
of	1
honour	1
or	1
reproach	1
to	1
him;	1
and	1
errors	1
of	1
this	1
kind	1
he	1
could	1
easily	1
correct	1
if	1
warned	1
by	1
a	1
friend.	1
But	1
where	1
is	1
such	1
a	1
friend	1
to	1
be	1
found	1
as	1
Lothario	1
would	1
have,	1
so	1
judicious,	1
so	1
loyal,	1
and	1
so	1
true?	1
Of	1
a	1
truth	1
I	1
know	1
not;	1
Lothario	1
alone	1
was	1
such	1
a	1
one,	1
for	1
with	1
the	1
utmost	1
care	1
and	1
vigilance	1
he	1
watched	1
over	1
the	1
honour	1
of	1
his	1
friend,	1
and	1
strove	1
to	1
diminish,	1
cut	1
down,	1
and	1
reduce	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
days	1
for	1
going	1
to	1
his	1
house	1
according	1
to	1
their	1
agreement,	1
lest	1
the	1
visits	1
of	1
a	1
young	1
man,	1
wealthy,	1
high-born,	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
attractions	1
he	1
was	1
conscious	1
of	1
possessing,	1
at	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
a	1
woman	1
so	1
beautiful	1
as	1
Camilla,	1
should	1
be	1
regarded	1
with	1
suspicion	1
by	1
the	1
inquisitive	1
and	1
malicious	1
eyes	1
of	1
the	1
idle	1
public.	1
For	1
though	1
his	1
integrity	1
and	1
reputation	1
might	1
bridle	1
slanderous	1
tongues,	1
still	1
he	1
was	1
unwilling	1
to	1
hazard	1
either	1
his	1
own	1
good	1
name	1
or	1
that	1
of	1
his	1
friend;	1
and	1
for	1
this	1
reason	1
most	1
of	1
the	1
days	1
agreed	1
upon	1
he	1
devoted	1
to	1
some	1
other	1
business	1
which	1
he	1
pretended	1
was	1
unavoidable;	1
so	1
that	1
a	1
great	1
portion	1
of	1
the	1
day	1
was	1
taken	1
up	1
with	1
complaints	1
on	1
one	1
side	1
and	1
excuses	1
on	1
the	1
other.	1
It	1
happened,	1
however,	1
that	1
on	1
one	1
occasion	1
when	1
the	1
two	1
were	1
strolling	1
together	1
outside	1
the	1
city,	1
Anselmo	1
addressed	1
the	1
following	1
words	1
to	1
Lothario.	1
“Thou	1
mayest	1
suppose,	1
Lothario	1
my	1
friend,	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
unable	1
to	1
give	1
sufficient	1
thanks	1
for	1
the	1
favours	1
God	1
has	1
rendered	1
me	1
in	1
making	1
me	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
such	1
parents	1
as	1
mine	1
were,	1
and	1
bestowing	1
upon	1
me	1
with	1
no	1
niggard	1
hand	1
what	1
are	1
called	1
the	1
gifts	1
of	1
nature	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
those	1
of	1
fortune,	1
and	1
above	1
all	1
for	1
what	1
he	1
has	1
done	1
in	1
giving	1
me	1
thee	1
for	1
a	1
friend	1
and	1
Camilla	1
for	1
a	1
wife—two	1
treasures	1
that	1
I	1
value,	1
if	1
not	1
as	1
highly	1
as	1
I	1
ought,	1
at	1
least	1
as	1
highly	1
as	1
I	1
am	1
able.	1
And	1
yet,	1
with	1
all	1
these	1
good	1
things,	1
which	1
are	1
commonly	1
all	1
that	1
men	1
need	1
to	1
enable	1
them	1
to	1
live	1
happily,	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
most	1
discontented	1
and	1
dissatisfied	1
man	1
in	1
the	1
whole	1
world;	1
for,	1
I	1
know	1
not	1
how	1
long	1
since,	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
harassed	1
and	1
oppressed	1
by	1
a	1
desire	1
so	1
strange	1
and	1
so	1
unusual,	1
that	1
I	1
wonder	1
at	1
myself	1
and	1
blame	1
and	1
chide	1
myself	1
when	1
I	1
am	1
alone,	1
and	1
strive	1
to	1
stifle	1
it	1
and	1
hide	1
it	1
from	1
my	1
own	1
thoughts,	1
and	1
with	1
no	1
better	1
success	1
than	1
if	1
I	1
were	1
endeavouring	1
deliberately	1
to	1
publish	1
it	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
world;	1
and	1
as,	1
in	1
short,	1
it	1
must	1
come	1
out,	1
I	1
would	1
confide	1
it	1
to	1
thy	1
safe	1
keeping,	1
feeling	1
sure	1
that	1
by	1
this	1
means,	1
and	1
by	1
thy	1
readiness	1
as	1
a	1
true	1
friend	1
to	1
afford	1
me	1
relief,	1
I	1
shall	1
soon	1
find	1
myself	1
freed	1
from	1
the	1
distress	1
it	1
causes	1
me,	1
and	1
that	1
thy	1
care	1
will	1
give	1
me	1
happiness	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
degree	1
as	1
my	1
own	1
folly	1
has	1
caused	1
me	1
misery.”	1
The	1
words	1
of	1
Anselmo	1
struck	1
Lothario	1
with	1
astonishment,	1
unable	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
to	1
conjecture	1
the	1
purport	1
of	1
such	1
a	1
lengthy	1
preamble;	1
and	1
though	1
he	1
strove	1
to	1
imagine	1
what	1
desire	1
it	1
could	1
be	1
that	1
so	1
troubled	1
his	1
friend,	1
his	1
conjectures	1
were	1
all	1
far	1
from	1
the	1
truth,	1
and	1
to	1
relieve	1
the	1
anxiety	1
which	1
this	1
perplexity	1
was	1
causing	1
him,	1
he	1
told	1
him	1
he	1
was	1
doing	1
a	1
flagrant	1
injustice	1
to	1
their	1
great	1
friendship	1
in	1
seeking	1
circuitous	1
methods	1
of	1
confiding	1
to	1
him	1
his	1
most	1
hidden	1
thoughts,	1
for	1
he	1
well	1
knew	1
he	1
might	1
reckon	1
upon	1
his	1
counsel	1
in	1
diverting	1
them,	1
or	1
his	1
help	1
in	1
carrying	1
them	1
into	1
effect.	1
“That	1
is	1
the	1
truth,”	1
replied	1
Anselmo,	1
“and	1
relying	1
upon	1
that	1
I	1
will	1
tell	1
thee,	1
friend	1
Lothario,	1
that	1
the	1
desire	1
which	1
harasses	1
me	1
is	1
that	1
of	1
knowing	1
whether	1
my	1
wife	1
Camilla	1
is	1
as	1
good	1
and	1
as	1
perfect	1
as	1
I	1
think	1
her	1
to	1
be;	1
and	1
I	1
cannot	1
satisfy	1
myself	1
of	1
the	1
truth	1
on	1
this	1
point	1
except	1
by	1
testing	1
her	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
way	1
that	1
the	1
trial	1
may	1
prove	1
the	1
purity	1
of	1
her	1
virtue	1
as	1
the	1
fire	1
proves	1
that	1
of	1
gold;	1
because	1
I	1
am	1
persuaded,	1
my	1
friend,	1
that	1
a	1
woman	1
is	1
virtuous	1
only	1
in	1
proportion	1
as	1
she	1
is	1
or	1
is	1
not	1
tempted;	1
and	1
that	1
she	1
alone	1
is	1
strong	1
who	1
does	1
not	1
yield	1
to	1
the	1
promises,	1
gifts,	1
tears,	1
and	1
importunities	1
of	1
earnest	1
lovers;	1
for	1
what	1
thanks	1
does	1
a	1
woman	1
deserve	1
for	1
being	1
good	1
if	1
no	1
one	1
urges	1
her	1
to	1
be	1
bad,	1
and	1
what	1
wonder	1
is	1
it	1
that	1
she	1
is	1
reserved	1
and	1
circumspect	1
to	1
whom	1
no	1
opportunity	1
is	1
given	1
of	1
going	1
wrong	1
and	1
who	1
knows	1
she	1
has	1
a	1
husband	1
that	1
will	1
take	1
her	1
life	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
he	1
detects	1
her	1
in	1
an	1
impropriety?	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
therefore	1
hold	1
her	1
who	1
is	1
virtuous	1
through	1
fear	1
or	1
want	1
of	1
opportunity	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
estimation	1
as	1
her	1
who	1
comes	1
out	1
of	1
temptation	1
and	1
trial	1
with	1
a	1
crown	1
of	1
victory;	1
and	1
so,	1
for	1
these	1
reasons	1
and	1
many	1
others	1
that	1
I	1
could	1
give	1
thee	1
to	1
justify	1
and	1
support	1
the	1
opinion	1
I	1
hold,	1
I	1
am	1
desirous	1
that	1
my	1
wife	1
Camilla	1
should	1
pass	1
this	1
crisis,	1
and	1
be	1
refined	1
and	1
tested	1
by	1
the	1
fire	1
of	1
finding	1
herself	1
wooed	1
and	1
by	1
one	1
worthy	1
to	1
set	1
his	1
affections	1
upon	1
her;	1
and	1
if	1
she	1
comes	1
out,	1
as	1
I	1
know	1
she	1
will,	1
victorious	1
from	1
this	1
struggle,	1
I	1
shall	1
look	1
upon	1
my	1
good	1
fortune	1
as	1
unequalled,	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
the	1
cup	1
of	1
my	1
desire	1
is	1
full,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
virtuous	1
woman	1
of	1
whom	1
the	1
sage	1
says	1
‘Who	1
shall	1
find	1
her?’	1
has	1
fallen	1
to	1
my	1
lot.	1
And	1
if	1
the	1
result	1
be	1
the	1
contrary	1
of	1
what	1
I	1
expect,	1
in	1
the	1
satisfaction	1
of	1
knowing	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
right	1
in	1
my	1
opinion,	1
I	1
shall	1
bear	1
without	1
complaint	1
the	1
pain	1
which	1
my	1
so	1
dearly	1
bought	1
experience	1
will	1
naturally	1
cause	1
me.	1
And,	1
as	1
nothing	1
of	1
all	1
thou	1
wilt	1
urge	1
in	1
opposition	1
to	1
my	1
wish	1
will	1
avail	1
to	1
keep	1
me	1
from	1
carrying	1
it	1
into	1
effect,	1
it	1
is	1
my	1
desire,	1
friend	1
Lothario,	1
that	1
thou	1
shouldst	1
consent	1
to	1
become	1
the	1
instrument	1
for	1
effecting	1
this	1
purpose	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
bent	1
upon,	1
for	1
I	1
will	1
afford	1
thee	1
opportunities	1
to	1
that	1
end,	1
and	1
nothing	1
shall	1
be	1
wanting	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
think	1
necessary	1
for	1
the	1
pursuit	1
of	1
a	1
virtuous,	1
honourable,	1
modest	1
and	1
high-minded	1
woman.	1
And	1
among	1
other	1
reasons,	1
I	1
am	1
induced	1
to	1
entrust	1
this	1
arduous	1
task	1
to	1
thee	1
by	1
the	1
consideration	1
that	1
if	1
Camilla	1
be	1
conquered	1
by	1
thee	1
the	1
conquest	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
pushed	1
to	1
extremes,	1
but	1
only	1
far	1
enough	1
to	1
account	1
that	1
accomplished	1
which	1
from	1
a	1
sense	1
of	1
honour	1
will	1
be	1
left	1
undone;	1
thus	1
I	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
wronged	1
in	1
anything	1
more	1
than	1
intention,	1
and	1
my	1
wrong	1
will	1
remain	1
buried	1
in	1
the	1
integrity	1
of	1
thy	1
silence,	1
which	1
I	1
know	1
well	1
will	1
be	1
as	1
lasting	1
as	1
that	1
of	1
death	1
in	1
what	1
concerns	1
me.	1
If,	1
therefore,	1
thou	1
wouldst	1
have	1
me	1
enjoy	1
what	1
can	1
be	1
called	1
life,	1
thou	1
wilt	1
at	1
once	1
engage	1
in	1
this	1
love	1
struggle,	1
not	1
lukewarmly	1
nor	1
slothfully,	1
but	1
with	1
the	1
energy	1
and	1
zeal	1
that	1
my	1
desire	1
demands,	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
loyalty	1
our	1
friendship	1
assures	1
me	1
of.”	1
Such	1
were	1
the	1
words	1
Anselmo	1
addressed	1
to	1
Lothario,	1
who	1
listened	1
to	1
them	1
with	1
such	1
attention	1
that,	1
except	1
to	1
say	1
what	1
has	1
been	1
already	1
mentioned,	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
open	1
his	1
lips	1
until	1
the	1
other	1
had	1
finished.	1
Then	1
perceiving	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
no	1
more	1
to	1
say,	1
after	1
regarding	1
him	1
for	1
a	1
while,	1
as	1
one	1
would	1
regard	1
something	1
never	1
before	1
seen	1
that	1
excited	1
wonder	1
and	1
amazement,	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
him,	1
“I	1
cannot	1
persuade	1
myself,	1
Anselmo	1
my	1
friend,	1
that	1
what	1
thou	1
hast	1
said	1
to	1
me	1
is	1
not	1
in	1
jest;	1
if	1
I	1
thought	1
that	1
thou	1
wert	1
speaking	1
seriously	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
allowed	1
thee	1
to	1
go	1
so	1
far;	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
put	1
a	1
stop	1
to	1
thy	1
long	1
harangue	1
by	1
not	1
listening	1
to	1
thee	1
I	1
verily	1
suspect	1
that	1
either	1
thou	1
dost	1
not	1
know	1
me,	1
or	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
thee;	1
but	1
no,	1
I	1
know	1
well	1
thou	1
art	1
Anselmo,	1
and	1
thou	1
knowest	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
Lothario;	1
the	1
misfortune	1
is,	1
it	1
seems	1
to	1
me,	1
that	1
thou	1
art	1
not	1
the	1
Anselmo	1
thou	1
wert,	1
and	1
must	1
have	1
thought	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
the	1
Lothario	1
I	1
should	1
be;	1
for	1
the	1
things	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
said	1
to	1
me	1
are	1
not	1
those	1
of	1
that	1
Anselmo	1
who	1
was	1
my	1
friend,	1
nor	1
are	1
those	1
that	1
thou	1
demandest	1
of	1
me	1
what	1
should	1
be	1
asked	1
of	1
the	1
Lothario	1
thou	1
knowest.	1
True	1
friends	1
will	1
prove	1
their	1
friends	1
and	1
make	1
use	1
of	1
them,	1
as	1
a	1
poet	1
has	1
said,	1
_usque	1
ad	1
aras;_	1
whereby	1
he	1
meant	1
that	1
they	1
will	1
not	1
make	1
use	1
of	1
their	1
friendship	1
in	1
things	1
that	1
are	1
contrary	1
to	1
God’s	1
will.	1
If	1
this,	1
then,	1
was	1
a	1
heathen’s	1
feeling	1
about	1
friendship,	1
how	1
much	1
more	1
should	1
it	1
be	1
a	1
Christian’s,	1
who	1
knows	1
that	1
the	1
divine	1
must	1
not	1
be	1
forfeited	1
for	1
the	1
sake	1
of	1
any	1
human	1
friendship?	1
And	1
if	1
a	1
friend	1
should	1
go	1
so	1
far	1
as	1
to	1
put	1
aside	1
his	1
duty	1
to	1
Heaven	1
to	1
fulfil	1
his	1
duty	1
to	1
his	1
friend,	1
it	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
in	1
matters	1
that	1
are	1
trifling	1
or	1
of	1
little	1
moment,	1
but	1
in	1
such	1
as	1
affect	1
the	1
friend’s	1
life	1
and	1
honour.	1
Now	1
tell	1
me,	1
Anselmo,	1
in	1
which	1
of	1
these	1
two	1
art	1
thou	1
imperilled,	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
hazard	1
myself	1
to	1
gratify	1
thee,	1
and	1
do	1
a	1
thing	1
so	1
detestable	1
as	1
that	1
thou	1
seekest	1
of	1
me?	1
Neither	1
forsooth;	1
on	1
the	1
contrary,	1
thou	1
dost	1
ask	1
of	1
me,	1
so	1
far	1
as	1
I	1
understand,	1
to	1
strive	1
and	1
labour	1
to	1
rob	1
thee	1
of	1
honour	1
and	1
life,	1
and	1
to	1
rob	1
myself	1
of	1
them	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time;	1
for	1
if	1
I	1
take	1
away	1
thy	1
honour	1
it	1
is	1
plain	1
I	1
take	1
away	1
thy	1
life,	1
as	1
a	1
man	1
without	1
honour	1
is	1
worse	1
than	1
dead;	1
and	1
being	1
the	1
instrument,	1
as	1
thou	1
wilt	1
have	1
it	1
so,	1
of	1
so	1
much	1
wrong	1
to	1
thee,	1
shall	1
not	1
I,	1
too,	1
be	1
left	1
without	1
honour,	1
and	1
consequently	1
without	1
life?	1
Listen	1
to	1
me,	1
Anselmo	1
my	1
friend,	1
and	1
be	1
not	1
impatient	1
to	1
answer	1
me	1
until	1
I	1
have	1
said	1
what	1
occurs	1
to	1
me	1
touching	1
the	1
object	1
of	1
thy	1
desire,	1
for	1
there	1
will	1
be	1
time	1
enough	1
left	1
for	1
thee	1
to	1
reply	1
and	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
hear.”	1
“Be	1
it	1
so,”	1
said	1
Anselmo,	1
“say	1
what	1
thou	1
wilt.”	1
Lothario	1
then	1
went	1
on	1
to	1
say,	1
“It	1
seems	1
to	1
me,	1
Anselmo,	1
that	1
thine	1
is	1
just	1
now	1
the	1
temper	1
of	1
mind	1
which	1
is	1
always	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
Moors,	1
who	1
can	1
never	1
be	1
brought	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
error	1
of	1
their	1
creed	1
by	1
quotations	1
from	1
the	1
Holy	1
Scriptures,	1
or	1
by	1
reasons	1
which	1
depend	1
upon	1
the	1
examination	1
of	1
the	1
understanding	1
or	1
are	1
founded	1
upon	1
the	1
articles	1
of	1
faith,	1
but	1
must	1
have	1
examples	1
that	1
are	1
palpable,	1
easy,	1
intelligible,	1
capable	1
of	1
proof,	1
not	1
admitting	1
of	1
doubt,	1
with	1
mathematical	1
demonstrations	1
that	1
cannot	1
be	1
denied,	1
like,	1
‘_If	1
equals	1
be	1
taken	1
from	1
equals,	1
the	1
remainders	1
are	1
equal:_’	1
and	1
if	1
they	1
do	1
not	1
understand	1
this	1
in	1
words,	1
and	1
indeed	1
they	1
do	1
not,	1
it	1
has	1
to	1
be	1
shown	1
to	1
them	1
with	1
the	1
hands,	1
and	1
put	1
before	1
their	1
eyes,	1
and	1
even	1
with	1
all	1
this	1
no	1
one	1
succeeds	1
in	1
convincing	1
them	1
of	1
the	1
truth	1
of	1
our	1
holy	1
religion.	1
This	1
same	1
mode	1
of	1
proceeding	1
I	1
shall	1
have	1
to	1
adopt	1
with	1
thee,	1
for	1
the	1
desire	1
which	1
has	1
sprung	1
up	1
in	1
thee	1
is	1
so	1
absurd	1
and	1
remote	1
from	1
everything	1
that	1
has	1
a	1
semblance	1
of	1
reason,	1
that	1
I	1
feel	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
waste	1
of	1
time	1
to	1
employ	1
it	1
in	1
reasoning	1
with	1
thy	1
simplicity,	1
for	1
at	1
present	1
I	1
will	1
call	1
it	1
by	1
no	1
other	1
name;	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
even	1
tempted	1
to	1
leave	1
thee	1
in	1
thy	1
folly	1
as	1
a	1
punishment	1
for	1
thy	1
pernicious	1
desire;	1
but	1
the	1
friendship	1
I	1
bear	1
thee,	1
which	1
will	1
not	1
allow	1
me	1
to	1
desert	1
thee	1
in	1
such	1
manifest	1
danger	1
of	1
destruction,	1
keeps	1
me	1
from	1
dealing	1
so	1
harshly	1
by	1
thee.	1
And	1
that	1
thou	1
mayest	1
clearly	1
see	1
this,	1
say,	1
Anselmo,	1
hast	1
thou	1
not	1
told	1
me	1
that	1
I	1
must	1
force	1
my	1
suit	1
upon	1
a	1
modest	1
woman,	1
decoy	1
one	1
that	1
is	1
virtuous,	1
make	1
overtures	1
to	1
one	1
that	1
is	1
pure-minded,	1
pay	1
court	1
to	1
one	1
that	1
is	1
prudent?	1
Yes,	1
thou	1
hast	1
told	1
me	1
so.	1
Then,	1
if	1
thou	1
knowest	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
a	1
wife,	1
modest,	1
virtuous,	1
pure-minded	1
and	1
prudent,	1
what	1
is	1
it	1
that	1
thou	1
seekest?	1
And	1
if	1
thou	1
believest	1
that	1
she	1
will	1
come	1
forth	1
victorious	1
from	1
all	1
my	1
attacks—as	1
doubtless	1
she	1
would—what	1
higher	1
titles	1
than	1
those	1
she	1
possesses	1
now	1
dost	1
thou	1
think	1
thou	1
canst	1
bestow	1
upon	1
her	1
then,	1
or	1
in	1
what	1
will	1
she	1
be	1
better	1
then	1
than	1
she	1
is	1
now?	1
Either	1
thou	1
dost	1
not	1
hold	1
her	1
to	1
be	1
what	1
thou	1
sayest,	1
or	1
thou	1
knowest	1
not	1
what	1
thou	1
dost	1
demand.	1
If	1
thou	1
dost	1
not	1
hold	1
her	1
to	1
be	1
what	1
thou	1
sayest,	1
why	1
dost	1
thou	1
seek	1
to	1
prove	1
her	1
instead	1
of	1
treating	1
her	1
as	1
guilty	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
that	1
may	1
seem	1
best	1
to	1
thee?	1
but	1
if	1
she	1
be	1
as	1
virtuous	1
as	1
thou	1
believest,	1
it	1
is	1
an	1
uncalled-for	1
proceeding	1
to	1
make	1
trial	1
of	1
truth	1
itself,	1
for,	1
after	1
trial,	1
it	1
will	1
but	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
estimation	1
as	1
before.	1
Thus,	1
then,	1
it	1
is	1
conclusive	1
that	1
to	1
attempt	1
things	1
from	1
which	1
harm	1
rather	1
than	1
advantage	1
may	1
come	1
to	1
us	1
is	1
the	1
part	1
of	1
unreasoning	1
and	1
reckless	1
minds,	1
more	1
especially	1
when	1
they	1
are	1
things	1
which	1
we	1
are	1
not	1
forced	1
or	1
compelled	1
to	1
attempt,	1
and	1
which	1
show	1
from	1
afar	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
plainly	1
madness	1
to	1
attempt	1
them.	1
“Difficulties	1
are	1
attempted	1
either	1
for	1
the	1
sake	1
of	1
God	1
or	1
for	1
the	1
sake	1
of	1
the	1
world,	1
or	1
for	1
both;	1
those	1
undertaken	1
for	1
God’s	1
sake	1
are	1
those	1
which	1
the	1
saints	1
undertake	1
when	1
they	1
attempt	1
to	1
live	1
the	1
lives	1
of	1
angels	1
in	1
human	1
bodies;	1
those	1
undertaken	1
for	1
the	1
sake	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
are	1
those	1
of	1
the	1
men	1
who	1
traverse	1
such	1
a	1
vast	1
expanse	1
of	1
water,	1
such	1
a	1
variety	1
of	1
climates,	1
so	1
many	1
strange	1
countries,	1
to	1
acquire	1
what	1
are	1
called	1
the	1
blessings	1
of	1
fortune;	1
and	1
those	1
undertaken	1
for	1
the	1
sake	1
of	1
God	1
and	1
the	1
world	1
together	1
are	1
those	1
of	1
brave	1
soldiers,	1
who	1
no	1
sooner	1
do	1
they	1
see	1
in	1
the	1
enemy’s	1
wall	1
a	1
breach	1
as	1
wide	1
as	1
a	1
cannon	1
ball	1
could	1
make,	1
than,	1
casting	1
aside	1
all	1
fear,	1
without	1
hesitating,	1
or	1
heeding	1
the	1
manifest	1
peril	1
that	1
threatens	1
them,	1
borne	1
onward	1
by	1
the	1
desire	1
of	1
defending	1
their	1
faith,	1
their	1
country,	1
and	1
their	1
king,	1
they	1
fling	1
themselves	1
dauntlessly	1
into	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
thousand	1
opposing	1
deaths	1
that	1
await	1
them.	1
Such	1
are	1
the	1
things	1
that	1
men	1
are	1
wont	1
to	1
attempt,	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
honour,	1
glory,	1
gain,	1
in	1
attempting	1
them,	1
however	1
full	1
of	1
difficulty	1
and	1
peril	1
they	1
may	1
be;	1
but	1
that	1
which	1
thou	1
sayest	1
it	1
is	1
thy	1
wish	1
to	1
attempt	1
and	1
carry	1
out	1
will	1
not	1
win	1
thee	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
God	1
nor	1
the	1
blessings	1
of	1
fortune	1
nor	1
fame	1
among	1
men;	1
for	1
even	1
if	1
the	1
issue	1
be	1
as	1
thou	1
wouldst	1
have	1
it,	1
thou	1
wilt	1
be	1
no	1
happier,	1
richer,	1
or	1
more	1
honoured	1
than	1
thou	1
art	1
this	1
moment;	1
and	1
if	1
it	1
be	1
otherwise	1
thou	1
wilt	1
be	1
reduced	1
to	1
misery	1
greater	1
than	1
can	1
be	1
imagined,	1
for	1
then	1
it	1
will	1
avail	1
thee	1
nothing	1
to	1
reflect	1
that	1
no	1
one	1
is	1
aware	1
of	1
the	1
misfortune	1
that	1
has	1
befallen	1
thee;	1
it	1
will	1
suffice	1
to	1
torture	1
and	1
crush	1
thee	1
that	1
thou	1
knowest	1
it	1
thyself.	1
And	1
in	1
confirmation	1
of	1
the	1
truth	1
of	1
what	1
I	1
say,	1
let	1
me	1
repeat	1
to	1
thee	1
a	1
stanza	1
made	1
by	1
the	1
famous	1
poet	1
Luigi	1
Tansillo	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
part	1
of	1
his	1
‘Tears	1
of	1
Saint	1
Peter,’	1
which	1
says	1
thus:	1
The	1
anguish	1
and	1
the	1
shame	1
but	1
greater	1
grew	1
In	1
Peter’s	1
heart	1
as	1
morning	1
slowly	1
came;	1
No	1
eye	1
was	1
there	1
to	1
see	1
him,	1
well	1
he	1
knew,	1
Yet	1
he	1
himself	1
was	1
to	1
himself	1
a	1
shame;	1
Exposed	1
to	1
all	1
men’s	1
gaze,	1
or	1
screened	1
from	1
view,	1
A	1
noble	1
heart	1
will	1
feel	1
the	1
pang	1
the	1
same;	1
A	1
prey	1
to	1
shame	1
the	1
sinning	1
soul	1
will	1
be,	1
Though	1
none	1
but	1
heaven	1
and	1
earth	1
its	1
shame	1
can	1
see.	1
Thus	1
by	1
keeping	1
it	1
secret	1
thou	1
wilt	1
not	1
escape	1
thy	1
sorrow,	1
but	1
rather	1
thou	1
wilt	1
shed	1
tears	1
unceasingly,	1
if	1
not	1
tears	1
of	1
the	1
eyes,	1
tears	1
of	1
blood	1
from	1
the	1
heart,	1
like	1
those	1
shed	1
by	1
that	1
simple	1
doctor	1
our	1
poet	1
tells	1
us	1
of,	1
that	1
tried	1
the	1
test	1
of	1
the	1
cup,	1
which	1
the	1
wise	1
Rinaldo,	1
better	1
advised,	1
refused	1
to	1
do;	1
for	1
though	1
this	1
may	1
be	1
a	1
poetic	1
fiction	1
it	1
contains	1
a	1
moral	1
lesson	1
worthy	1
of	1
attention	1
and	1
study	1
and	1
imitation.	1
Moreover	1
by	1
what	1
I	1
am	1
about	1
to	1
say	1
to	1
thee	1
thou	1
wilt	1
be	1
led	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
great	1
error	1
thou	1
wouldst	1
commit.	1
“Tell	1
me,	1
Anselmo,	1
if	1
Heaven	1
or	1
good	1
fortune	1
had	1
made	1
thee	1
master	1
and	1
lawful	1
owner	1
of	1
a	1
diamond	1
of	1
the	1
finest	1
quality,	1
with	1
the	1
excellence	1
and	1
purity	1
of	1
which	1
all	1
the	1
lapidaries	1
that	1
had	1
seen	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
satisfied,	1
saying	1
with	1
one	1
voice	1
and	1
common	1
consent	1
that	1
in	1
purity,	1
quality,	1
and	1
fineness,	1
it	1
was	1
all	1
that	1
a	1
stone	1
of	1
the	1
kind	1
could	1
possibly	1
be,	1
thou	1
thyself	1
too	1
being	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
belief,	1
as	1
knowing	1
nothing	1
to	1
the	1
contrary,	1
would	1
it	1
be	1
reasonable	1
in	1
thee	1
to	1
desire	1
to	1
take	1
that	1
diamond	1
and	1
place	1
it	1
between	1
an	1
anvil	1
and	1
a	1
hammer,	1
and	1
by	1
mere	1
force	1
of	1
blows	1
and	1
strength	1
of	1
arm	1
try	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
as	1
hard	1
and	1
as	1
fine	1
as	1
they	1
said?	1
And	1
if	1
thou	1
didst,	1
and	1
if	1
the	1
stone	1
should	1
resist	1
so	1
silly	1
a	1
test,	1
that	1
would	1
add	1
nothing	1
to	1
its	1
value	1
or	1
reputation;	1
and	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
broken,	1
as	1
it	1
might	1
be,	1
would	1
not	1
all	1
be	1
lost?	1
Undoubtedly	1
it	1
would,	1
leaving	1
its	1
owner	1
to	1
be	1
rated	1
as	1
a	1
fool	1
in	1
the	1
opinion	1
of	1
all.	1
Consider,	1
then,	1
Anselmo	1
my	1
friend,	1
that	1
Camilla	1
is	1
a	1
diamond	1
of	1
the	1
finest	1
quality	1
as	1
well	1
in	1
thy	1
estimation	1
as	1
in	1
that	1
of	1
others,	1
and	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
contrary	1
to	1
reason	1
to	1
expose	1
her	1
to	1
the	1
risk	1
of	1
being	1
broken;	1
for	1
if	1
she	1
remains	1
intact	1
she	1
cannot	1
rise	1
to	1
a	1
higher	1
value	1
than	1
she	1
now	1
possesses;	1
and	1
if	1
she	1
give	1
way	1
and	1
be	1
unable	1
to	1
resist,	1
bethink	1
thee	1
now	1
how	1
thou	1
wilt	1
be	1
deprived	1
of	1
her,	1
and	1
with	1
what	1
good	1
reason	1
thou	1
wilt	1
complain	1
of	1
thyself	1
for	1
having	1
been	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
her	1
ruin	1
and	1
thine	1
own.	1
Remember	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
jewel	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
so	1
precious	1
as	1
a	1
chaste	1
and	1
virtuous	1
woman,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
whole	1
honour	1
of	1
women	1
consists	1
in	1
reputation;	1
and	1
since	1
thy	1
wife’s	1
is	1
of	1
that	1
high	1
excellence	1
that	1
thou	1
knowest,	1
wherefore	1
shouldst	1
thou	1
seek	1
to	1
call	1
that	1
truth	1
in	1
question?	1
Remember,	1
my	1
friend,	1
that	1
woman	1
is	1
an	1
imperfect	1
animal,	1
and	1
that	1
impediments	1
are	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
placed	1
in	1
her	1
way	1
to	1
make	1
her	1
trip	1
and	1
fall,	1
but	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
be	1
removed,	1
and	1
her	1
path	1
left	1
clear	1
of	1
all	1
obstacles,	1
so	1
that	1
without	1
hindrance	1
she	1
may	1
run	1
her	1
course	1
freely	1
to	1
attain	1
the	1
desired	1
perfection,	1
which	1
consists	1
in	1
being	1
virtuous.	1
Naturalists	1
tell	1
us	1
that	1
the	1
ermine	1
is	1
a	1
little	1
animal	1
which	1
has	1
a	1
fur	1
of	1
purest	1
white,	1
and	1
that	1
when	1
the	1
hunters	1
wish	1
to	1
take	1
it,	1
they	1
make	1
use	1
of	1
this	1
artifice.	1
Having	1
ascertained	1
the	1
places	1
which	1
it	1
frequents	1
and	1
passes,	1
they	1
stop	1
the	1
way	1
to	1
them	1
with	1
mud,	1
and	1
then	1
rousing	1
it,	1
drive	1
it	1
towards	1
the	1
spot,	1
and	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
the	1
ermine	1
comes	1
to	1
the	1
mud	1
it	1
halts,	1
and	1
allows	1
itself	1
to	1
be	1
taken	1
captive	1
rather	1
than	1
pass	1
through	1
the	1
mire,	1
and	1
spoil	1
and	1
sully	1
its	1
whiteness,	1
which	1
it	1
values	1
more	1
than	1
life	1
and	1
liberty.	1
The	1
virtuous	1
and	1
chaste	1
woman	1
is	1
an	1
ermine,	1
and	1
whiter	1
and	1
purer	1
than	1
snow	1
is	1
the	1
virtue	1
of	1
modesty;	1
and	1
he	1
who	1
wishes	1
her	1
not	1
to	1
lose	1
it,	1
but	1
to	1
keep	1
and	1
preserve	1
it,	1
must	1
adopt	1
a	1
course	1
different	1
from	1
that	1
employed	1
with	1
the	1
ermine;	1
he	1
must	1
not	1
put	1
before	1
her	1
the	1
mire	1
of	1
the	1
gifts	1
and	1
attentions	1
of	1
persevering	1
lovers,	1
because	1
perhaps—and	1
even	1
without	1
a	1
perhaps—she	1
may	1
not	1
have	1
sufficient	1
virtue	1
and	1
natural	1
strength	1
in	1
herself	1
to	1
pass	1
through	1
and	1
tread	1
under	1
foot	1
these	1
impediments;	1
they	1
must	1
be	1
removed,	1
and	1
the	1
brightness	1
of	1
virtue	1
and	1
the	1
beauty	1
of	1
a	1
fair	1
fame	1
must	1
be	1
put	1
before	1
her.	1
A	1
virtuous	1
woman,	1
too,	1
is	1
like	1
a	1
mirror,	1
of	1
clear	1
shining	1
crystal,	1
liable	1
to	1
be	1
tarnished	1
and	1
dimmed	1
by	1
every	1
breath	1
that	1
touches	1
it.	1
She	1
must	1
be	1
treated	1
as	1
relics	1
are;	1
adored,	1
not	1
touched.	1
She	1
must	1
be	1
protected	1
and	1
prized	1
as	1
one	1
protects	1
and	1
prizes	1
a	1
fair	1
garden	1
full	1
of	1
roses	1
and	1
flowers,	1
the	1
owner	1
of	1
which	1
allows	1
no	1
one	1
to	1
trespass	1
or	1
pluck	1
a	1
blossom;	1
enough	1
for	1
others	1
that	1
from	1
afar	1
and	1
through	1
the	1
iron	1
grating	1
they	1
may	1
enjoy	1
its	1
fragrance	1
and	1
its	1
beauty.	1
Finally	1
let	1
me	1
repeat	1
to	1
thee	1
some	1
verses	1
that	1
come	1
to	1
my	1
mind;	1
I	1
heard	1
them	1
in	1
a	1
modern	1
comedy,	1
and	1
it	1
seems	1
to	1
me	1
they	1
bear	1
upon	1
the	1
point	1
we	1
are	1
discussing.	1
A	1
prudent	1
old	1
man	1
was	1
giving	1
advice	1
to	1
another,	1
the	1
father	1
of	1
a	1
young	1
girl,	1
to	1
lock	1
her	1
up,	1
watch	1
over	1
her	1
and	1
keep	1
her	1
in	1
seclusion,	1
and	1
among	1
other	1
arguments	1
he	1
used	1
these:	1
Woman	1
is	1
a	1
thing	1
of	1
glass;	1
But	1
her	1
brittleness	1
’tis	1
best	1
Not	1
too	1
curiously	1
to	1
test:	1
Who	1
knows	1
what	1
may	1
come	1
to	1
pass?	1
Breaking	1
is	1
an	1
easy	1
matter,	1
And	1
it’s	1
folly	1
to	1
expose	1
What	1
you	1
cannot	1
mend	1
to	1
blows;	1
What	1
you	1
can’t	1
make	1
whole	1
to	1
shatter.	1
This,	1
then,	1
all	1
may	1
hold	1
as	1
true,	1
And	1
the	1
reason’s	1
plain	1
to	1
see;	1
For	1
if	1
Danaës	1
there	1
be,	1
There	1
are	1
golden	1
showers	1
too.	1
“All	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
said	1
to	1
thee	1
so	1
far,	1
Anselmo,	1
has	1
had	1
reference	1
to	1
what	1
concerns	1
thee;	1
now	1
it	1
is	1
right	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
say	1
something	1
of	1
what	1
regards	1
myself;	1
and	1
if	1
I	1
be	1
prolix,	1
pardon	1
me,	1
for	1
the	1
labyrinth	1
into	1
which	1
thou	1
hast	1
entered	1
and	1
from	1
which	1
thou	1
wouldst	1
have	1
me	1
extricate	1
thee	1
makes	1
it	1
necessary.	1
“Thou	1
dost	1
reckon	1
me	1
thy	1
friend,	1
and	1
thou	1
wouldst	1
rob	1
me	1
of	1
honour,	1
a	1
thing	1
wholly	1
inconsistent	1
with	1
friendship;	1
and	1
not	1
only	1
dost	1
thou	1
aim	1
at	1
this,	1
but	1
thou	1
wouldst	1
have	1
me	1
rob	1
thee	1
of	1
it	1
also.	1
That	1
thou	1
wouldst	1
rob	1
me	1
of	1
it	1
is	1
clear,	1
for	1
when	1
Camilla	1
sees	1
that	1
I	1
pay	1
court	1
to	1
her	1
as	1
thou	1
requirest,	1
she	1
will	1
certainly	1
regard	1
me	1
as	1
a	1
man	1
without	1
honour	1
or	1
right	1
feeling,	1
since	1
I	1
attempt	1
and	1
do	1
a	1
thing	1
so	1
much	1
opposed	1
to	1
what	1
I	1
owe	1
to	1
my	1
own	1
position	1
and	1
thy	1
friendship.	1
That	1
thou	1
wouldst	1
have	1
me	1
rob	1
thee	1
of	1
it	1
is	1
beyond	1
a	1
doubt,	1
for	1
Camilla,	1
seeing	1
that	1
I	1
press	1
my	1
suit	1
upon	1
her,	1
will	1
suppose	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
perceived	1
in	1
her	1
something	1
light	1
that	1
has	1
encouraged	1
me	1
to	1
make	1
known	1
to	1
her	1
my	1
base	1
desire;	1
and	1
if	1
she	1
holds	1
herself	1
dishonoured,	1
her	1
dishonour	1
touches	1
thee	1
as	1
belonging	1
to	1
her;	1
and	1
hence	1
arises	1
what	1
so	1
commonly	1
takes	1
place,	1
that	1
the	1
husband	1
of	1
the	1
adulterous	1
woman,	1
though	1
he	1
may	1
not	1
be	1
aware	1
of	1
or	1
have	1
given	1
any	1
cause	1
for	1
his	1
wife’s	1
failure	1
in	1
her	1
duty,	1
or	1
(being	1
careless	1
or	1
negligent)	1
have	1
had	1
it	1
in	1
his	1
power	1
to	1
prevent	1
his	1
dishonour,	1
nevertheless	1
is	1
stigmatised	1
by	1
a	1
vile	1
and	1
reproachful	1
name,	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
manner	1
regarded	1
with	1
eyes	1
of	1
contempt	1
instead	1
of	1
pity	1
by	1
all	1
who	1
know	1
of	1
his	1
wife’s	1
guilt,	1
though	1
they	1
see	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
unfortunate	1
not	1
by	1
his	1
own	1
fault,	1
but	1
by	1
the	1
lust	1
of	1
a	1
vicious	1
consort.	1
But	1
I	1
will	1
tell	1
thee	1
why	1
with	1
good	1
reason	1
dishonour	1
attaches	1
to	1
the	1
husband	1
of	1
the	1
unchaste	1
wife,	1
though	1
he	1
know	1
not	1
that	1
she	1
is	1
so,	1
nor	1
be	1
to	1
blame,	1
nor	1
have	1
done	1
anything,	1
or	1
given	1
any	1
provocation	1
to	1
make	1
her	1
so;	1
and	1
be	1
not	1
weary	1
with	1
listening	1
to	1
me,	1
for	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
for	1
thy	1
good.	1
“When	1
God	1
created	1
our	1
first	1
parent	1
in	1
the	1
earthly	1
paradise,	1
the	1
Holy	1
Scripture	1
says	1
that	1
he	1
infused	1
sleep	1
into	1
Adam	1
and	1
while	1
he	1
slept	1
took	1
a	1
rib	1
from	1
his	1
left	1
side	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
formed	1
our	1
mother	1
Eve,	1
and	1
when	1
Adam	1
awoke	1
and	1
beheld	1
her	1
he	1
said,	1
‘This	1
is	1
flesh	1
of	1
my	1
flesh,	1
and	1
bone	1
of	1
my	1
bone.’	1
And	1
God	1
said	1
‘For	1
this	1
shall	1
a	1
man	1
leave	1
his	1
father	1
and	1
his	1
mother,	1
and	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
two	1
in	1
one	1
flesh;	1
and	1
then	1
was	1
instituted	1
the	1
divine	1
sacrament	1
of	1
marriage,	1
with	1
such	1
ties	1
that	1
death	1
alone	1
can	1
loose	1
them.	1
And	1
such	1
is	1
the	1
force	1
and	1
virtue	1
of	1
this	1
miraculous	1
sacrament	1
that	1
it	1
makes	1
two	1
different	1
persons	1
one	1
and	1
the	1
same	1
flesh;	1
and	1
even	1
more	1
than	1
this	1
when	1
the	1
virtuous	1
are	1
married;	1
for	1
though	1
they	1
have	1
two	1
souls	1
they	1
have	1
but	1
one	1
will.	1
And	1
hence	1
it	1
follows	1
that	1
as	1
the	1
flesh	1
of	1
the	1
wife	1
is	1
one	1
and	1
the	1
same	1
with	1
that	1
of	1
her	1
husband	1
the	1
stains	1
that	1
may	1
come	1
upon	1
it,	1
or	1
the	1
injuries	1
it	1
incurs	1
fall	1
upon	1
the	1
husband’s	1
flesh,	1
though	1
he,	1
as	1
has	1
been	1
said,	1
may	1
have	1
given	1
no	1
cause	1
for	1
them;	1
for	1
as	1
the	1
pain	1
of	1
the	1
foot	1
or	1
any	1
member	1
of	1
the	1
body	1
is	1
felt	1
by	1
the	1
whole	1
body,	1
because	1
all	1
is	1
one	1
flesh,	1
as	1
the	1
head	1
feels	1
the	1
hurt	1
to	1
the	1
ankle	1
without	1
having	1
caused	1
it,	1
so	1
the	1
husband,	1
being	1
one	1
with	1
her,	1
shares	1
the	1
dishonour	1
of	1
the	1
wife;	1
and	1
as	1
all	1
worldly	1
honour	1
or	1
dishonour	1
comes	1
of	1
flesh	1
and	1
blood,	1
and	1
the	1
erring	1
wife’s	1
is	1
of	1
that	1
kind,	1
the	1
husband	1
must	1
needs	1
bear	1
his	1
part	1
of	1
it	1
and	1
be	1
held	1
dishonoured	1
without	1
knowing	1
it.	1
See,	1
then,	1
Anselmo,	1
the	1
peril	1
thou	1
art	1
encountering	1
in	1
seeking	1
to	1
disturb	1
the	1
peace	1
of	1
thy	1
virtuous	1
consort;	1
see	1
for	1
what	1
an	1
empty	1
and	1
ill-advised	1
curiosity	1
thou	1
wouldst	1
rouse	1
up	1
passions	1
that	1
now	1
repose	1
in	1
quiet	1
in	1
the	1
breast	1
of	1
thy	1
chaste	1
wife;	1
reflect	1
that	1
what	1
thou	1
art	1
staking	1
all	1
to	1
win	1
is	1
little,	1
and	1
what	1
thou	1
wilt	1
lose	1
so	1
much	1
that	1
I	1
leave	1
it	1
undescribed,	1
not	1
having	1
the	1
words	1
to	1
express	1
it.	1
But	1
if	1
all	1
I	1
have	1
said	1
be	1
not	1
enough	1
to	1
turn	1
thee	1
from	1
thy	1
vile	1
purpose,	1
thou	1
must	1
seek	1
some	1
other	1
instrument	1
for	1
thy	1
dishonour	1
and	1
misfortune;	1
for	1
such	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
consent	1
to	1
be,	1
though	1
I	1
lose	1
thy	1
friendship,	1
the	1
greatest	1
loss	1
that	1
I	1
can	1
conceive.”	1
Having	1
said	1
this,	1
the	1
wise	1
and	1
virtuous	1
Lothario	1
was	1
silent,	1
and	1
Anselmo,	1
troubled	1
in	1
mind	1
and	1
deep	1
in	1
thought,	1
was	1
unable	1
for	1
a	1
while	1
to	1
utter	1
a	1
word	1
in	1
reply;	1
but	1
at	1
length	1
he	1
said,	1
“I	1
have	1
listened,	1
Lothario	1
my	1
friend,	1
attentively,	1
as	1
thou	1
hast	1
seen,	1
to	1
what	1
thou	1
hast	1
chosen	1
to	1
say	1
to	1
me,	1
and	1
in	1
thy	1
arguments,	1
examples,	1
and	1
comparisons	1
I	1
have	1
seen	1
that	1
high	1
intelligence	1
thou	1
dost	1
possess,	1
and	1
the	1
perfection	1
of	1
true	1
friendship	1
thou	1
hast	1
reached;	1
and	1
likewise	1
I	1
see	1
and	1
confess	1
that	1
if	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
guided	1
by	1
thy	1
opinion,	1
but	1
follow	1
my	1
own,	1
I	1
am	1
flying	1
from	1
the	1
good	1
and	1
pursuing	1
the	1
evil.	1
This	1
being	1
so,	1
thou	1
must	1
remember	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
now	1
labouring	1
under	1
that	1
infirmity	1
which	1
women	1
sometimes	1
suffer	1
from,	1
when	1
the	1
craving	1
seizes	1
them	1
to	1
eat	1
clay,	1
plaster,	1
charcoal,	1
and	1
things	1
even	1
worse,	1
disgusting	1
to	1
look	1
at,	1
much	1
more	1
to	1
eat;	1
so	1
that	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
necessary	1
to	1
have	1
recourse	1
to	1
some	1
artifice	1
to	1
cure	1
me;	1
and	1
this	1
can	1
be	1
easily	1
effected	1
if	1
only	1
thou	1
wilt	1
make	1
a	1
beginning,	1
even	1
though	1
it	1
be	1
in	1
a	1
lukewarm	1
and	1
make-believe	1
fashion,	1
to	1
pay	1
court	1
to	1
Camilla,	1
who	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
so	1
yielding	1
that	1
her	1
virtue	1
will	1
give	1
way	1
at	1
the	1
first	1
attack:	1
with	1
this	1
mere	1
attempt	1
I	1
shall	1
rest	1
satisfied,	1
and	1
thou	1
wilt	1
have	1
done	1
what	1
our	1
friendship	1
binds	1
thee	1
to	1
do,	1
not	1
only	1
in	1
giving	1
me	1
life,	1
but	1
in	1
persuading	1
me	1
not	1
to	1
discard	1
my	1
honour.	1
And	1
this	1
thou	1
art	1
bound	1
to	1
do	1
for	1
one	1
reason	1
alone,	1
that,	1
being,	1
as	1
I	1
am,	1
resolved	1
to	1
apply	1
this	1
test,	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
for	1
thee	1
to	1
permit	1
me	1
to	1
reveal	1
my	1
weakness	1
to	1
another,	1
and	1
so	1
imperil	1
that	1
honour	1
thou	1
art	1
striving	1
to	1
keep	1
me	1
from	1
losing;	1
and	1
if	1
thine	1
may	1
not	1
stand	1
as	1
high	1
as	1
it	1
ought	1
in	1
the	1
estimation	1
of	1
Camilla	1
while	1
thou	1
art	1
paying	1
court	1
to	1
her,	1
that	1
is	1
of	1
little	1
or	1
no	1
importance,	1
because	1
ere	1
long,	1
on	1
finding	1
in	1
her	1
that	1
constancy	1
which	1
we	1
expect,	1
thou	1
canst	1
tell	1
her	1
the	1
plain	1
truth	1
as	1
regards	1
our	1
stratagem,	1
and	1
so	1
regain	1
thy	1
place	1
in	1
her	1
esteem;	1
and	1
as	1
thou	1
art	1
venturing	1
so	1
little,	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
venture	1
canst	1
afford	1
me	1
so	1
much	1
satisfaction,	1
refuse	1
not	1
to	1
undertake	1
it,	1
even	1
if	1
further	1
difficulties	1
present	1
themselves	1
to	1
thee;	1
for,	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
said,	1
if	1
thou	1
wilt	1
only	1
make	1
a	1
beginning	1
I	1
will	1
acknowledge	1
the	1
issue	1
decided.”	1
Lothario	1
seeing	1
the	1
fixed	1
determination	1
of	1
Anselmo,	1
and	1
not	1
knowing	1
what	1
further	1
examples	1
to	1
offer	1
or	1
arguments	1
to	1
urge	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
dissuade	1
him	1
from	1
it,	1
and	1
perceiving	1
that	1
he	1
threatened	1
to	1
confide	1
his	1
pernicious	1
scheme	1
to	1
someone	1
else,	1
to	1
avoid	1
a	1
greater	1
evil	1
resolved	1
to	1
gratify	1
him	1
and	1
do	1
what	1
he	1
asked,	1
intending	1
to	1
manage	1
the	1
business	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
satisfy	1
Anselmo	1
without	1
corrupting	1
the	1
mind	1
of	1
Camilla;	1
so	1
in	1
reply	1
he	1
told	1
him	1
not	1
to	1
communicate	1
his	1
purpose	1
to	1
any	1
other,	1
for	1
he	1
would	1
undertake	1
the	1
task	1
himself,	1
and	1
would	1
begin	1
it	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
pleased.	1
Anselmo	1
embraced	1
him	1
warmly	1
and	1
affectionately,	1
and	1
thanked	1
him	1
for	1
his	1
offer	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
bestowed	1
some	1
great	1
favour	1
upon	1
him;	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
agreed	1
between	1
them	1
to	1
set	1
about	1
it	1
the	1
next	1
day,	1
Anselmo	1
affording	1
opportunity	1
and	1
time	1
to	1
Lothario	1
to	1
converse	1
alone	1
with	1
Camilla,	1
and	1
furnishing	1
him	1
with	1
money	1
and	1
jewels	1
to	1
offer	1
and	1
present	1
to	1
her.	1
He	1
suggested,	1
too,	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
treat	1
her	1
to	1
music,	1
and	1
write	1
verses	1
in	1
her	1
praise,	1
and	1
if	1
he	1
was	1
unwilling	1
to	1
take	1
the	1
trouble	1
of	1
composing	1
them,	1
he	1
offered	1
to	1
do	1
it	1
himself.	1
Lothario	1
agreed	1
to	1
all	1
with	1
an	1
intention	1
very	1
different	1
from	1
what	1
Anselmo	1
supposed,	1
and	1
with	1
this	1
understanding	1
they	1
returned	1
to	1
Anselmo’s	1
house,	1
where	1
they	1
found	1
Camilla	1
awaiting	1
her	1
husband	1
anxiously	1
and	1
uneasily,	1
for	1
he	1
was	1
later	1
than	1
usual	1
in	1
returning	1
that	1
day.	1
Lothario	1
repaired	1
to	1
his	1
own	1
house,	1
and	1
Anselmo	1
remained	1
in	1
his,	1
as	1
well	1
satisfied	1
as	1
Lothario	1
was	1
troubled	1
in	1
mind;	1
for	1
he	1
could	1
see	1
no	1
satisfactory	1
way	1
out	1
of	1
this	1
ill-advised	1
business.	1
That	1
night,	1
however,	1
he	1
thought	1
of	1
a	1
plan	1
by	1
which	1
he	1
might	1
deceive	1
Anselmo	1
without	1
any	1
injury	1
to	1
Camilla.	1
The	1
next	1
day	1
he	1
went	1
to	1
dine	1
with	1
his	1
friend,	1
and	1
was	1
welcomed	1
by	1
Camilla,	1
who	1
received	1
and	1
treated	1
him	1
with	1
great	1
cordiality,	1
knowing	1
the	1
affection	1
her	1
husband	1
felt	1
for	1
him.	1
When	1
dinner	1
was	1
over	1
and	1
the	1
cloth	1
removed,	1
Anselmo	1
told	1
Lothario	1
to	1
stay	1
there	1
with	1
Camilla	1
while	1
he	1
attended	1
to	1
some	1
pressing	1
business,	1
as	1
he	1
would	1
return	1
in	1
an	1
hour	1
and	1
a	1
half.	1
Camilla	1
begged	1
him	1
not	1
to	1
go,	1
and	1
Lothario	1
offered	1
to	1
accompany	1
him,	1
but	1
nothing	1
could	1
persuade	1
Anselmo,	1
who	1
on	1
the	1
contrary	1
pressed	1
Lothario	1
to	1
remain	1
waiting	1
for	1
him	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
a	1
matter	1
of	1
great	1
importance	1
to	1
discuss	1
with	1
him.	1
At	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
he	1
bade	1
Camilla	1
not	1
to	1
leave	1
Lothario	1
alone	1
until	1
he	1
came	1
back.	1
In	1
short	1
he	1
contrived	1
to	1
put	1
so	1
good	1
a	1
face	1
on	1
the	1
reason,	1
or	1
the	1
folly,	1
of	1
his	1
absence	1
that	1
no	1
one	1
could	1
have	1
suspected	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
pretence.	1
Anselmo	1
took	1
his	1
departure,	1
and	1
Camilla	1
and	1
Lothario	1
were	1
left	1
alone	1
at	1
the	1
table,	1
for	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
household	1
had	1
gone	1
to	1
dinner.	1
Lothario	1
saw	1
himself	1
in	1
the	1
lists	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
friend’s	1
wish,	1
and	1
facing	1
an	1
enemy	1
that	1
could	1
by	1
her	1
beauty	1
alone	1
vanquish	1
a	1
squadron	1
of	1
armed	1
knights;	1
judge	1
whether	1
he	1
had	1
good	1
reason	1
to	1
fear;	1
but	1
what	1
he	1
did	1
was	1
to	1
lean	1
his	1
elbow	1
on	1
the	1
arm	1
of	1
the	1
chair,	1
and	1
his	1
cheek	1
upon	1
his	1
hand,	1
and,	1
asking	1
Camilla’s	1
pardon	1
for	1
his	1
ill	1
manners,	1
he	1
said	1
he	1
wished	1
to	1
take	1
a	1
little	1
sleep	1
until	1
Anselmo	1
returned.	1
Camilla	1
in	1
reply	1
said	1
he	1
could	1
repose	1
more	1
at	1
his	1
ease	1
in	1
the	1
reception-room	1
than	1
in	1
his	1
chair,	1
and	1
begged	1
of	1
him	1
to	1
go	1
in	1
and	1
sleep	1
there;	1
but	1
Lothario	1
declined,	1
and	1
there	1
he	1
remained	1
asleep	1
until	1
the	1
return	1
of	1
Anselmo,	1
who	1
finding	1
Camilla	1
in	1
her	1
own	1
room,	1
and	1
Lothario	1
asleep,	1
imagined	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
stayed	1
away	1
so	1
long	1
as	1
to	1
have	1
afforded	1
them	1
time	1
enough	1
for	1
conversation	1
and	1
even	1
for	1
sleep,	1
and	1
was	1
all	1
impatience	1
until	1
Lothario	1
should	1
wake	1
up,	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
go	1
out	1
with	1
him	1
and	1
question	1
him	1
as	1
to	1
his	1
success.	1
Everything	1
fell	1
out	1
as	1
he	1
wished;	1
Lothario	1
awoke,	1
and	1
the	1
two	1
at	1
once	1
left	1
the	1
house,	1
and	1
Anselmo	1
asked	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
anxious	1
to	1
know,	1
and	1
Lothario	1
in	1
answer	1
told	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
thought	1
it	1
advisable	1
to	1
declare	1
himself	1
entirely	1
the	1
first	1
time,	1
and	1
therefore	1
had	1
only	1
extolled	1
the	1
charms	1
of	1
Camilla,	1
telling	1
her	1
that	1
all	1
the	1
city	1
spoke	1
of	1
nothing	1
else	1
but	1
her	1
beauty	1
and	1
wit,	1
for	1
this	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
an	1
excellent	1
way	1
of	1
beginning	1
to	1
gain	1
her	1
good-will	1
and	1
render	1
her	1
disposed	1
to	1
listen	1
to	1
him	1
with	1
pleasure	1
the	1
next	1
time,	1
thus	1
availing	1
himself	1
of	1
the	1
device	1
the	1
devil	1
has	1
recourse	1
to	1
when	1
he	1
would	1
deceive	1
one	1
who	1
is	1
on	1
the	1
watch;	1
for	1
he	1
being	1
the	1
angel	1
of	1
darkness	1
transforms	1
himself	1
into	1
an	1
angel	1
of	1
light,	1
and,	1
under	1
cover	1
of	1
a	1
fair	1
seeming,	1
discloses	1
himself	1
at	1
length,	1
and	1
effects	1
his	1
purpose	1
if	1
at	1
the	1
beginning	1
his	1
wiles	1
are	1
not	1
discovered.	1
All	1
this	1
gave	1
great	1
satisfaction	1
to	1
Anselmo,	1
and	1
he	1
said	1
he	1
would	1
afford	1
the	1
same	1
opportunity	1
every	1
day,	1
but	1
without	1
leaving	1
the	1
house,	1
for	1
he	1
would	1
find	1
things	1
to	1
do	1
at	1
home	1
so	1
that	1
Camilla	1
should	1
not	1
detect	1
the	1
plot.	1
Thus,	1
then,	1
several	1
days	1
went	1
by,	1
and	1
Lothario,	1
without	1
uttering	1
a	1
word	1
to	1
Camilla,	1
reported	1
to	1
Anselmo	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
talked	1
with	1
her	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
never	1
been	1
able	1
to	1
draw	1
from	1
her	1
the	1
slightest	1
indication	1
of	1
consent	1
to	1
anything	1
dishonourable,	1
nor	1
even	1
a	1
sign	1
or	1
shadow	1
of	1
hope;	1
on	1
the	1
contrary,	1
he	1
said	1
she	1
would	1
inform	1
her	1
husband	1
of	1
it.	1
“So	1
far	1
well,”	1
said	1
Anselmo;	1
“Camilla	1
has	1
thus	1
far	1
resisted	1
words;	1
we	1
must	1
now	1
see	1
how	1
she	1
will	1
resist	1
deeds.	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
you	1
to-morrow	1
two	1
thousand	1
crowns	1
in	1
gold	1
for	1
you	1
to	1
offer	1
or	1
even	1
present,	1
and	1
as	1
many	1
more	1
to	1
buy	1
jewels	1
to	1
lure	1
her,	1
for	1
women	1
are	1
fond	1
of	1
being	1
becomingly	1
attired	1
and	1
going	1
gaily	1
dressed,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
more	1
so	1
if	1
they	1
are	1
beautiful,	1
however	1
chaste	1
they	1
may	1
be;	1
and	1
if	1
she	1
resists	1
this	1
temptation,	1
I	1
will	1
rest	1
satisfied	1
and	1
will	1
give	1
you	1
no	1
more	1
trouble.”	1
Lothario	1
replied	1
that	1
now	1
he	1
had	1
begun	1
he	1
would	1
carry	1
on	1
the	1
undertaking	1
to	1
the	1
end,	1
though	1
he	1
perceived	1
he	1
was	1
to	1
come	1
out	1
of	1
it	1
wearied	1
and	1
vanquished.	1
The	1
next	1
day	1
he	1
received	1
the	1
four	1
thousand	1
crowns,	1
and	1
with	1
them	1
four	1
thousand	1
perplexities,	1
for	1
he	1
knew	1
not	1
what	1
to	1
say	1
by	1
way	1
of	1
a	1
new	1
falsehood;	1
but	1
in	1
the	1
end	1
he	1
made	1
up	1
his	1
mind	1
to	1
tell	1
him	1
that	1
Camilla	1
stood	1
as	1
firm	1
against	1
gifts	1
and	1
promises	1
as	1
against	1
words,	1
and	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
use	1
in	1
taking	1
any	1
further	1
trouble,	1
for	1
the	1
time	1
was	1
all	1
spent	1
to	1
no	1
purpose.	1
But	1
chance,	1
directing	1
things	1
in	1
a	1
different	1
manner,	1
so	1
ordered	1
it	1
that	1
Anselmo,	1
having	1
left	1
Lothario	1
and	1
Camilla	1
alone	1
as	1
on	1
other	1
occasions,	1
shut	1
himself	1
into	1
a	1
chamber	1
and	1
posted	1
himself	1
to	1
watch	1
and	1
listen	1
through	1
the	1
keyhole	1
to	1
what	1
passed	1
between	1
them,	1
and	1
perceived	1
that	1
for	1
more	1
than	1
half	1
an	1
hour	1
Lothario	1
did	1
not	1
utter	1
a	1
word	1
to	1
Camilla,	1
nor	1
would	1
utter	1
a	1
word	1
though	1
he	1
were	1
to	1
be	1
there	1
for	1
an	1
age;	1
and	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
conclusion	1
that	1
what	1
his	1
friend	1
had	1
told	1
him	1
about	1
the	1
replies	1
of	1
Camilla	1
was	1
all	1
invention	1
and	1
falsehood,	1
and	1
to	1
ascertain	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
so,	1
he	1
came	1
out,	1
and	1
calling	1
Lothario	1
aside	1
asked	1
him	1
what	1
news	1
he	1
had	1
and	1
in	1
what	1
humour	1
Camilla	1
was.	1
Lothario	1
replied	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
disposed	1
to	1
go	1
on	1
with	1
the	1
business,	1
for	1
she	1
had	1
answered	1
him	1
so	1
angrily	1
and	1
harshly	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
no	1
heart	1
to	1
say	1
anything	1
more	1
to	1
her.	1
“Ah,	1
Lothario,	1
Lothario,”	1
said	1
Anselmo,	1
“how	1
ill	1
dost	1
thou	1
meet	1
thy	1
obligations	1
to	1
me,	1
and	1
the	1
great	1
confidence	1
I	1
repose	1
in	1
thee!	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
just	1
now	1
watching	1
through	1
this	1
keyhole,	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
seen	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
not	1
said	1
a	1
word	1
to	1
Camilla,	1
whence	1
I	1
conclude	1
that	1
on	1
the	1
former	1
occasions	1
thou	1
hast	1
not	1
spoken	1
to	1
her	1
either,	1
and	1
if	1
this	1
be	1
so,	1
as	1
no	1
doubt	1
it	1
is,	1
why	1
dost	1
thou	1
deceive	1
me,	1
or	1
wherefore	1
seekest	1
thou	1
by	1
craft	1
to	1
deprive	1
me	1
of	1
the	1
means	1
I	1
might	1
find	1
of	1
attaining	1
my	1
desire?”	1
Anselmo	1
said	1
no	1
more,	1
but	1
he	1
had	1
said	1
enough	1
to	1
cover	1
Lothario	1
with	1
shame	1
and	1
confusion,	1
and	1
he,	1
feeling	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
his	1
honour	1
touched	1
by	1
having	1
been	1
detected	1
in	1
a	1
lie,	1
swore	1
to	1
Anselmo	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
from	1
that	1
moment	1
devote	1
himself	1
to	1
satisfying	1
him	1
without	1
any	1
deception,	1
as	1
he	1
would	1
see	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
the	1
curiosity	1
to	1
watch;	1
though	1
he	1
need	1
not	1
take	1
the	1
trouble,	1
for	1
the	1
pains	1
he	1
would	1
take	1
to	1
satisfy	1
him	1
would	1
remove	1
all	1
suspicions	1
from	1
his	1
mind.	1
Anselmo	1
believed	1
him,	1
and	1
to	1
afford	1
him	1
an	1
opportunity	1
more	1
free	1
and	1
less	1
liable	1
to	1
surprise,	1
he	1
resolved	1
to	1
absent	1
himself	1
from	1
his	1
house	1
for	1
eight	1
days,	1
betaking	1
himself	1
to	1
that	1
of	1
a	1
friend	1
of	1
his	1
who	1
lived	1
in	1
a	1
village	1
not	1
far	1
from	1
the	1
city;	1
and,	1
the	1
better	1
to	1
account	1
for	1
his	1
departure	1
to	1
Camilla,	1
he	1
so	1
arranged	1
it	1
that	1
the	1
friend	1
should	1
send	1
him	1
a	1
very	1
pressing	1
invitation.	1
Unhappy,	1
shortsighted	1
Anselmo,	1
what	1
art	1
thou	1
doing,	1
what	1
art	1
thou	1
plotting,	1
what	1
art	1
thou	1
devising?	1
Bethink	1
thee	1
thou	1
art	1
working	1
against	1
thyself,	1
plotting	1
thine	1
own	1
dishonour,	1
devising	1
thine	1
own	1
ruin.	1
Thy	1
wife	1
Camilla	1
is	1
virtuous,	1
thou	1
dost	1
possess	1
her	1
in	1
peace	1
and	1
quietness,	1
no	1
one	1
assails	1
thy	1
happiness,	1
her	1
thoughts	1
wander	1
not	1
beyond	1
the	1
walls	1
of	1
thy	1
house,	1
thou	1
art	1
her	1
heaven	1
on	1
earth,	1
the	1
object	1
of	1
her	1
wishes,	1
the	1
fulfilment	1
of	1
her	1
desires,	1
the	1
measure	1
wherewith	1
she	1
measures	1
her	1
will,	1
making	1
it	1
conform	1
in	1
all	1
things	1
to	1
thine	1
and	1
Heaven’s.	1
If,	1
then,	1
the	1
mine	1
of	1
her	1
honour,	1
beauty,	1
virtue,	1
and	1
modesty	1
yields	1
thee	1
without	1
labour	1
all	1
the	1
wealth	1
it	1
contains	1
and	1
thou	1
canst	1
wish	1
for,	1
why	1
wilt	1
thou	1
dig	1
the	1
earth	1
in	1
search	1
of	1
fresh	1
veins,	1
of	1
new	1
unknown	1
treasure,	1
risking	1
the	1
collapse	1
of	1
all,	1
since	1
it	1
but	1
rests	1
on	1
the	1
feeble	1
props	1
of	1
her	1
weak	1
nature?	1
Bethink	1
thee	1
that	1
from	1
him	1
who	1
seeks	1
impossibilities	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
possible	1
may	1
with	1
justice	1
be	1
withheld,	1
as	1
was	1
better	1
expressed	1
by	1
a	1
poet	1
who	1
said:	1
’Tis	1
mine	1
to	1
seek	1
for	1
life	1
in	1
death,	1
Health	1
in	1
disease	1
seek	1
I,	1
I	1
seek	1
in	1
prison	1
freedom’s	1
breath,	1
In	1
traitors	1
loyalty.	1
So	1
Fate	1
that	1
ever	1
scorns	1
to	1
grant	1
Or	1
grace	1
or	1
boon	1
to	1
me,	1
Since	1
what	1
can	1
never	1
be	1
I	1
want,	1
Denies	1
me	1
what	1
might	1
be.	1
The	1
next	1
day	1
Anselmo	1
took	1
his	1
departure	1
for	1
the	1
village,	1
leaving	1
instructions	1
with	1
Camilla	1
that	1
during	1
his	1
absence	1
Lothario	1
would	1
come	1
to	1
look	1
after	1
his	1
house	1
and	1
to	1
dine	1
with	1
her,	1
and	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
to	1
treat	1
him	1
as	1
she	1
would	1
himself.	1
Camilla	1
was	1
distressed,	1
as	1
a	1
discreet	1
and	1
right-minded	1
woman	1
would	1
be,	1
at	1
the	1
orders	1
her	1
husband	1
left	1
her,	1
and	1
bade	1
him	1
remember	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
becoming	1
that	1
anyone	1
should	1
occupy	1
his	1
seat	1
at	1
the	1
table	1
during	1
his	1
absence,	1
and	1
if	1
he	1
acted	1
thus	1
from	1
not	1
feeling	1
confidence	1
that	1
she	1
would	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
manage	1
his	1
house,	1
let	1
him	1
try	1
her	1
this	1
time,	1
and	1
he	1
would	1
find	1
by	1
experience	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
equal	1
to	1
greater	1
responsibilities.	1
Anselmo	1
replied	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
his	1
pleasure	1
to	1
have	1
it	1
so,	1
and	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
only	1
to	1
submit	1
and	1
obey.	1
Camilla	1
said	1
she	1
would	1
do	1
so,	1
though	1
against	1
her	1
will.	1
Anselmo	1
went,	1
and	1
the	1
next	1
day	1
Lothario	1
came	1
to	1
his	1
house,	1
where	1
he	1
was	1
received	1
by	1
Camilla	1
with	1
a	1
friendly	1
and	1
modest	1
welcome;	1
but	1
she	1
never	1
suffered	1
Lothario	1
to	1
see	1
her	1
alone,	1
for	1
she	1
was	1
always	1
attended	1
by	1
her	1
men	1
and	1
women	1
servants,	1
especially	1
by	1
a	1
handmaid	1
of	1
hers,	1
Leonela	1
by	1
name,	1
to	1
whom	1
she	1
was	1
much	1
attached	1
(for	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
brought	1
up	1
together	1
from	1
childhood	1
in	1
her	1
father’s	1
house),	1
and	1
whom	1
she	1
had	1
kept	1
with	1
her	1
after	1
her	1
marriage	1
with	1
Anselmo.	1
The	1
first	1
three	1
days	1
Lothario	1
did	1
not	1
speak	1
to	1
her,	1
though	1
he	1
might	1
have	1
done	1
so	1
when	1
they	1
removed	1
the	1
cloth	1
and	1
the	1
servants	1
retired	1
to	1
dine	1
hastily;	1
for	1
such	1
were	1
Camilla’s	1
orders;	1
nay	1
more,	1
Leonela	1
had	1
directions	1
to	1
dine	1
earlier	1
than	1
Camilla	1
and	1
never	1
to	1
leave	1
her	1
side.	1
She,	1
however,	1
having	1
her	1
thoughts	1
fixed	1
upon	1
other	1
things	1
more	1
to	1
her	1
taste,	1
and	1
wanting	1
that	1
time	1
and	1
opportunity	1
for	1
her	1
own	1
pleasures,	1
did	1
not	1
always	1
obey	1
her	1
mistress’s	1
commands,	1
but	1
on	1
the	1
contrary	1
left	1
them	1
alone,	1
as	1
if	1
they	1
had	1
ordered	1
her	1
to	1
do	1
so;	1
but	1
the	1
modest	1
bearing	1
of	1
Camilla,	1
the	1
calmness	1
of	1
her	1
countenance,	1
the	1
composure	1
of	1
her	1
aspect	1
were	1
enough	1
to	1
bridle	1
the	1
tongue	1
of	1
Lothario.	1
But	1
the	1
influence	1
which	1
the	1
many	1
virtues	1
of	1
Camilla	1
exerted	1
in	1
imposing	1
silence	1
on	1
Lothario’s	1
tongue	1
proved	1
mischievous	1
for	1
both	1
of	1
them,	1
for	1
if	1
his	1
tongue	1
was	1
silent	1
his	1
thoughts	1
were	1
busy,	1
and	1
could	1
dwell	1
at	1
leisure	1
upon	1
the	1
perfections	1
of	1
Camilla’s	1
goodness	1
and	1
beauty	1
one	1
by	1
one,	1
charms	1
enough	1
to	1
warm	1
with	1
love	1
a	1
marble	1
statue,	1
not	1
to	1
say	1
a	1
heart	1
of	1
flesh.	1
Lothario	1
gazed	1
upon	1
her	1
when	1
he	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
speaking	1
to	1
her,	1
and	1
thought	1
how	1
worthy	1
of	1
being	1
loved	1
she	1
was;	1
and	1
thus	1
reflection	1
began	1
little	1
by	1
little	1
to	1
assail	1
his	1
allegiance	1
to	1
Anselmo,	1
and	1
a	1
thousand	1
times	1
he	1
thought	1
of	1
withdrawing	1
from	1
the	1
city	1
and	1
going	1
where	1
Anselmo	1
should	1
never	1
see	1
him	1
nor	1
he	1
see	1
Camilla.	1
But	1
already	1
the	1
delight	1
he	1
found	1
in	1
gazing	1
on	1
her	1
interposed	1
and	1
held	1
him	1
fast.	1
He	1
put	1
a	1
constraint	1
upon	1
himself,	1
and	1
struggled	1
to	1
repel	1
and	1
repress	1
the	1
pleasure	1
he	1
found	1
in	1
contemplating	1
Camilla;	1
when	1
alone	1
he	1
blamed	1
himself	1
for	1
his	1
weakness,	1
called	1
himself	1
a	1
bad	1
friend,	1
nay	1
a	1
bad	1
Christian;	1
then	1
he	1
argued	1
the	1
matter	1
and	1
compared	1
himself	1
with	1
Anselmo;	1
always	1
coming	1
to	1
the	1
conclusion	1
that	1
the	1
folly	1
and	1
rashness	1
of	1
Anselmo	1
had	1
been	1
worse	1
than	1
his	1
faithlessness,	1
and	1
that	1
if	1
he	1
could	1
excuse	1
his	1
intentions	1
as	1
easily	1
before	1
God	1
as	1
with	1
man,	1
he	1
had	1
no	1
reason	1
to	1
fear	1
any	1
punishment	1
for	1
his	1
offence.	1
In	1
short	1
the	1
beauty	1
and	1
goodness	1
of	1
Camilla,	1
joined	1
with	1
the	1
opportunity	1
which	1
the	1
blind	1
husband	1
had	1
placed	1
in	1
his	1
hands,	1
overthrew	1
the	1
loyalty	1
of	1
Lothario;	1
and	1
giving	1
heed	1
to	1
nothing	1
save	1
the	1
object	1
towards	1
which	1
his	1
inclinations	1
led	1
him,	1
after	1
Anselmo	1
had	1
been	1
three	1
days	1
absent,	1
during	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
carrying	1
on	1
a	1
continual	1
struggle	1
with	1
his	1
passion,	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
make	1
love	1
to	1
Camilla	1
with	1
so	1
much	1
vehemence	1
and	1
warmth	1
of	1
language	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
overwhelmed	1
with	1
amazement,	1
and	1
could	1
only	1
rise	1
from	1
her	1
place	1
and	1
retire	1
to	1
her	1
room	1
without	1
answering	1
him	1
a	1
word.	1
But	1
the	1
hope	1
which	1
always	1
springs	1
up	1
with	1
love	1
was	1
not	1
weakened	1
in	1
Lothario	1
by	1
this	1
repelling	1
demeanour;	1
on	1
the	1
contrary	1
his	1
passion	1
for	1
Camilla	1
increased,	1
and	1
she	1
discovering	1
in	1
him	1
what	1
she	1
had	1
never	1
expected,	1
knew	1
not	1
what	1
to	1
do;	1
and	1
considering	1
it	1
neither	1
safe	1
nor	1
right	1
to	1
give	1
him	1
the	1
chance	1
or	1
opportunity	1
of	1
speaking	1
to	1
her	1
again,	1
she	1
resolved	1
to	1
send,	1
as	1
she	1
did	1
that	1
very	1
night,	1
one	1
of	1
her	1
servants	1
with	1
a	1
letter	1
to	1
Anselmo,	1
in	1
which	1
she	1
addressed	1
the	1
following	1
words	1
to	1
him.	1
CHAPTER	1
XXXIV.	1
IN	1
WHICH	1
IS	1
CONTINUED	1
THE	1
NOVEL	1
OF	1
“THE	1
ILL-ADVISED	1
CURIOSITY”	1
“It	1
is	1
commonly	1
said	1
that	1
an	1
army	1
looks	1
ill	1
without	1
its	1
general	1
and	1
a	1
castle	1
without	1
its	1
castellan,	1
and	1
I	1
say	1
that	1
a	1
young	1
married	1
woman	1
looks	1
still	1
worse	1
without	1
her	1
husband	1
unless	1
there	1
are	1
very	1
good	1
reasons	1
for	1
it.	1
I	1
find	1
myself	1
so	1
ill	1
at	1
ease	1
without	1
you,	1
and	1
so	1
incapable	1
of	1
enduring	1
this	1
separation,	1
that	1
unless	1
you	1
return	1
quickly	1
I	1
shall	1
have	1
to	1
go	1
for	1
relief	1
to	1
my	1
parents’	1
house,	1
even	1
if	1
I	1
leave	1
yours	1
without	1
a	1
protector;	1
for	1
the	1
one	1
you	1
left	1
me,	1
if	1
indeed	1
he	1
deserved	1
that	1
title,	1
has,	1
I	1
think,	1
more	1
regard	1
to	1
his	1
own	1
pleasure	1
than	1
to	1
what	1
concerns	1
you:	1
as	1
you	1
are	1
possessed	1
of	1
discernment	1
I	1
need	1
say	1
no	1
more	1
to	1
you,	1
nor	1
indeed	1
is	1
it	1
fitting	1
I	1
should	1
say	1
more.”	1
Anselmo	1
received	1
this	1
letter,	1
and	1
from	1
it	1
he	1
gathered	1
that	1
Lothario	1
had	1
already	1
begun	1
his	1
task	1
and	1
that	1
Camilla	1
must	1
have	1
replied	1
to	1
him	1
as	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
wished;	1
and	1
delighted	1
beyond	1
measure	1
at	1
such	1
intelligence	1
he	1
sent	1
word	1
to	1
her	1
not	1
to	1
leave	1
his	1
house	1
on	1
any	1
account,	1
as	1
he	1
would	1
very	1
shortly	1
return.	1
Camilla	1
was	1
astonished	1
at	1
Anselmo’s	1
reply,	1
which	1
placed	1
her	1
in	1
greater	1
perplexity	1
than	1
before,	1
for	1
she	1
neither	1
dared	1
to	1
remain	1
in	1
her	1
own	1
house,	1
nor	1
yet	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
her	1
parents’;	1
for	1
in	1
remaining	1
her	1
virtue	1
was	1
imperilled,	1
and	1
in	1
going	1
she	1
was	1
opposing	1
her	1
husband’s	1
commands.	1
Finally	1
she	1
decided	1
upon	1
what	1
was	1
the	1
worse	1
course	1
for	1
her,	1
to	1
remain,	1
resolving	1
not	1
to	1
fly	1
from	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
Lothario,	1
that	1
she	1
might	1
not	1
give	1
food	1
for	1
gossip	1
to	1
her	1
servants;	1
and	1
she	1
now	1
began	1
to	1
regret	1
having	1
written	1
as	1
she	1
had	1
to	1
her	1
husband,	1
fearing	1
he	1
might	1
imagine	1
that	1
Lothario	1
had	1
perceived	1
in	1
her	1
some	1
lightness	1
which	1
had	1
impelled	1
him	1
to	1
lay	1
aside	1
the	1
respect	1
he	1
owed	1
her;	1
but	1
confident	1
of	1
her	1
rectitude	1
she	1
put	1
her	1
trust	1
in	1
God	1
and	1
in	1
her	1
own	1
virtuous	1
intentions,	1
with	1
which	1
she	1
hoped	1
to	1
resist	1
in	1
silence	1
all	1
the	1
solicitations	1
of	1
Lothario,	1
without	1
saying	1
anything	1
to	1
her	1
husband	1
so	1
as	1
not	1
to	1
involve	1
him	1
in	1
any	1
quarrel	1
or	1
trouble;	1
and	1
she	1
even	1
began	1
to	1
consider	1
how	1
to	1
excuse	1
Lothario	1
to	1
Anselmo	1
when	1
he	1
should	1
ask	1
her	1
what	1
it	1
was	1
that	1
induced	1
her	1
to	1
write	1
that	1
letter.	1
With	1
these	1
resolutions,	1
more	1
honourable	1
than	1
judicious	1
or	1
effectual,	1
she	1
remained	1
the	1
next	1
day	1
listening	1
to	1
Lothario,	1
who	1
pressed	1
his	1
suit	1
so	1
strenuously	1
that	1
Camilla’s	1
firmness	1
began	1
to	1
waver,	1
and	1
her	1
virtue	1
had	1
enough	1
to	1
do	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
rescue	1
of	1
her	1
eyes	1
and	1
keep	1
them	1
from	1
showing	1
signs	1
of	1
a	1
certain	1
tender	1
compassion	1
which	1
the	1
tears	1
and	1
appeals	1
of	1
Lothario	1
had	1
awakened	1
in	1
her	1
bosom.	1
Lothario	1
observed	1
all	1
this,	1
and	1
it	1
inflamed	1
him	1
all	1
the	1
more.	1
In	1
short	1
he	1
felt	1
that	1
while	1
Anselmo’s	1
absence	1
afforded	1
time	1
and	1
opportunity	1
he	1
must	1
press	1
the	1
siege	1
of	1
the	1
fortress,	1
and	1
so	1
he	1
assailed	1
her	1
self-esteem	1
with	1
praises	1
of	1
her	1
beauty,	1
for	1
there	1
is	1
nothing	1
that	1
more	1
quickly	1
reduces	1
and	1
levels	1
the	1
castle	1
towers	1
of	1
fair	1
women’s	1
vanity	1
than	1
vanity	1
itself	1
upon	1
the	1
tongue	1
of	1
flattery.	1
In	1
fact	1
with	1
the	1
utmost	1
assiduity	1
he	1
undermined	1
the	1
rock	1
of	1
her	1
purity	1
with	1
such	1
engines	1
that	1
had	1
Camilla	1
been	1
of	1
brass	1
she	1
must	1
have	1
fallen.	1
He	1
wept,	1
he	1
entreated,	1
he	1
promised,	1
he	1
flattered,	1
he	1
importuned,	1
he	1
pretended	1
with	1
so	1
much	1
feeling	1
and	1
apparent	1
sincerity,	1
that	1
he	1
overthrew	1
the	1
virtuous	1
resolves	1
of	1
Camilla	1
and	1
won	1
the	1
triumph	1
he	1
least	1
expected	1
and	1
most	1
longed	1
for.	1
Camilla	1
yielded,	1
Camilla	1
fell;	1
but	1
what	1
wonder	1
if	1
the	1
friendship	1
of	1
Lothario	1
could	1
not	1
stand	1
firm?	1
A	1
clear	1
proof	1
to	1
us	1
that	1
the	1
passion	1
of	1
love	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
conquered	1
only	1
by	1
flying	1
from	1
it,	1
and	1
that	1
no	1
one	1
should	1
engage	1
in	1
a	1
struggle	1
with	1
an	1
enemy	1
so	1
mighty;	1
for	1
divine	1
strength	1
is	1
needed	1
to	1
overcome	1
his	1
human	1
power.	1
Leonela	1
alone	1
knew	1
of	1
her	1
mistress’s	1
weakness,	1
for	1
the	1
two	1
false	1
friends	1
and	1
new	1
lovers	1
were	1
unable	1
to	1
conceal	1
it.	1
Lothario	1
did	1
not	1
care	1
to	1
tell	1
Camilla	1
the	1
object	1
Anselmo	1
had	1
in	1
view,	1
nor	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
afforded	1
him	1
the	1
opportunity	1
of	1
attaining	1
such	1
a	1
result,	1
lest	1
she	1
should	1
undervalue	1
his	1
love	1
and	1
think	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
by	1
chance	1
and	1
without	1
intending	1
it	1
and	1
not	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
accord	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
made	1
love	1
to	1
her.	1
A	1
few	1
days	1
later	1
Anselmo	1
returned	1
to	1
his	1
house	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
perceive	1
what	1
it	1
had	1
lost,	1
that	1
which	1
he	1
so	1
lightly	1
treated	1
and	1
so	1
highly	1
prized.	1
He	1
went	1
at	1
once	1
to	1
see	1
Lothario,	1
and	1
found	1
him	1
at	1
home;	1
they	1
embraced	1
each	1
other,	1
and	1
Anselmo	1
asked	1
for	1
the	1
tidings	1
of	1
his	1
life	1
or	1
his	1
death.	1
“The	1
tidings	1
I	1
have	1
to	1
give	1
thee,	1
Anselmo	1
my	1
friend,”	1
said	1
Lothario,	1
“are	1
that	1
thou	1
dost	1
possess	1
a	1
wife	1
that	1
is	1
worthy	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
pattern	1
and	1
crown	1
of	1
all	1
good	1
wives.	1
The	1
words	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
addressed	1
to	1
her	1
were	1
borne	1
away	1
on	1
the	1
wind,	1
my	1
promises	1
have	1
been	1
despised,	1
my	1
presents	1
have	1
been	1
refused,	1
such	1
feigned	1
tears	1
as	1
I	1
shed	1
have	1
been	1
turned	1
into	1
open	1
ridicule.	1
In	1
short,	1
as	1
Camilla	1
is	1
the	1
essence	1
of	1
all	1
beauty,	1
so	1
is	1
she	1
the	1
treasure-house	1
where	1
purity	1
dwells,	1
and	1
gentleness	1
and	1
modesty	1
abide	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
virtues	1
that	1
can	1
confer	1
praise,	1
honour,	1
and	1
happiness	1
upon	1
a	1
woman.	1
Take	1
back	1
thy	1
money,	1
my	1
friend;	1
here	1
it	1
is,	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
had	1
no	1
need	1
to	1
touch	1
it,	1
for	1
the	1
chastity	1
of	1
Camilla	1
yields	1
not	1
to	1
things	1
so	1
base	1
as	1
gifts	1
or	1
promises.	1
Be	1
content,	1
Anselmo,	1
and	1
refrain	1
from	1
making	1
further	1
proof;	1
and	1
as	1
thou	1
hast	1
passed	1
dryshod	1
through	1
the	1
sea	1
of	1
those	1
doubts	1
and	1
suspicions	1
that	1
are	1
and	1
may	1
be	1
entertained	1
of	1
women,	1
seek	1
not	1
to	1
plunge	1
again	1
into	1
the	1
deep	1
ocean	1
of	1
new	1
embarrassments,	1
or	1
with	1
another	1
pilot	1
make	1
trial	1
of	1
the	1
goodness	1
and	1
strength	1
of	1
the	1
bark	1
that	1
Heaven	1
has	1
granted	1
thee	1
for	1
thy	1
passage	1
across	1
the	1
sea	1
of	1
this	1
world;	1
but	1
reckon	1
thyself	1
now	1
safe	1
in	1
port,	1
moor	1
thyself	1
with	1
the	1
anchor	1
of	1
sound	1
reflection,	1
and	1
rest	1
in	1
peace	1
until	1
thou	1
art	1
called	1
upon	1
to	1
pay	1
that	1
debt	1
which	1
no	1
nobility	1
on	1
earth	1
can	1
escape	1
paying.”	1
Anselmo	1
was	1
completely	1
satisfied	1
by	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
Lothario,	1
and	1
believed	1
them	1
as	1
fully	1
as	1
if	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
spoken	1
by	1
an	1
oracle;	1
nevertheless	1
he	1
begged	1
of	1
him	1
not	1
to	1
relinquish	1
the	1
undertaking,	1
were	1
it	1
but	1
for	1
the	1
sake	1
of	1
curiosity	1
and	1
amusement;	1
though	1
thenceforward	1
he	1
need	1
not	1
make	1
use	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
earnest	1
endeavours	1
as	1
before;	1
all	1
he	1
wished	1
him	1
to	1
do	1
was	1
to	1
write	1
some	1
verses	1
to	1
her,	1
praising	1
her	1
under	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Chloris,	1
for	1
he	1
himself	1
would	1
give	1
her	1
to	1
understand	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
a	1
lady	1
to	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
given	1
that	1
name	1
to	1
enable	1
him	1
to	1
sing	1
her	1
praises	1
with	1
the	1
decorum	1
due	1
to	1
her	1
modesty;	1
and	1
if	1
Lothario	1
were	1
unwilling	1
to	1
take	1
the	1
trouble	1
of	1
writing	1
the	1
verses	1
he	1
would	1
compose	1
them	1
himself.	1
“That	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
necessary,”	1
said	1
Lothario,	1
“for	1
the	1
muses	1
are	1
not	1
such	1
enemies	1
of	1
mine	1
but	1
that	1
they	1
visit	1
me	1
now	1
and	1
then	1
in	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
the	1
year.	1
Do	1
thou	1
tell	1
Camilla	1
what	1
thou	1
hast	1
proposed	1
about	1
a	1
pretended	1
amour	1
of	1
mine;	1
as	1
for	1
the	1
verses	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
them,	1
and	1
if	1
not	1
as	1
good	1
as	1
the	1
subject	1
deserves,	1
they	1
shall	1
be	1
at	1
least	1
the	1
best	1
I	1
can	1
produce.”	1
An	1
agreement	1
to	1
this	1
effect	1
was	1
made	1
between	1
the	1
friends,	1
the	1
ill-advised	1
one	1
and	1
the	1
treacherous,	1
and	1
Anselmo	1
returning	1
to	1
his	1
house	1
asked	1
Camilla	1
the	1
question	1
she	1
already	1
wondered	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
asked	1
before—what	1
it	1
was	1
that	1
had	1
caused	1
her	1
to	1
write	1
the	1
letter	1
she	1
had	1
sent	1
him.	1
Camilla	1
replied	1
that	1
it	1
had	1
seemed	1
to	1
her	1
that	1
Lothario	1
looked	1
at	1
her	1
somewhat	1
more	1
freely	1
than	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
at	1
home;	1
but	1
that	1
now	1
she	1
was	1
undeceived	1
and	1
believed	1
it	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
only	1
her	1
own	1
imagination,	1
for	1
Lothario	1
now	1
avoided	1
seeing	1
her,	1
or	1
being	1
alone	1
with	1
her.	1
Anselmo	1
told	1
her	1
she	1
might	1
be	1
quite	1
easy	1
on	1
the	1
score	1
of	1
that	1
suspicion,	1
for	1
he	1
knew	1
that	1
Lothario	1
was	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
a	1
damsel	1
of	1
rank	1
in	1
the	1
city	1
whom	1
he	1
celebrated	1
under	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Chloris,	1
and	1
that	1
even	1
if	1
he	1
were	1
not,	1
his	1
fidelity	1
and	1
their	1
great	1
friendship	1
left	1
no	1
room	1
for	1
fear.	1
Had	1
not	1
Camilla,	1
however,	1
been	1
informed	1
beforehand	1
by	1
Lothario	1
that	1
this	1
love	1
for	1
Chloris	1
was	1
a	1
pretence,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
himself	1
had	1
told	1
Anselmo	1
of	1
it	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
be	1
able	1
sometimes	1
to	1
give	1
utterance	1
to	1
the	1
praises	1
of	1
Camilla	1
herself,	1
no	1
doubt	1
she	1
would	1
have	1
fallen	1
into	1
the	1
despairing	1
toils	1
of	1
jealousy;	1
but	1
being	1
forewarned	1
she	1
received	1
the	1
startling	1
news	1
without	1
uneasiness.	1
The	1
next	1
day	1
as	1
the	1
three	1
were	1
at	1
table	1
Anselmo	1
asked	1
Lothario	1
to	1
recite	1
something	1
of	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
composed	1
for	1
his	1
mistress	1
Chloris;	1
for	1
as	1
Camilla	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
her,	1
he	1
might	1
safely	1
say	1
what	1
he	1
liked.	1
“Even	1
did	1
she	1
know	1
her,”	1
returned	1
Lothario,	1
“I	1
would	1
hide	1
nothing,	1
for	1
when	1
a	1
lover	1
praises	1
his	1
lady’s	1
beauty,	1
and	1
charges	1
her	1
with	1
cruelty,	1
he	1
casts	1
no	1
imputation	1
upon	1
her	1
fair	1
name;	1
at	1
any	1
rate,	1
all	1
I	1
can	1
say	1
is	1
that	1
yesterday	1
I	1
made	1
a	1
sonnet	1
on	1
the	1
ingratitude	1
of	1
this	1
Chloris,	1
which	1
goes	1
thus:	1
SONNET	1
At	1
midnight,	1
in	1
the	1
silence,	1
when	1
the	1
eyes	1
Of	1
happier	1
mortals	1
balmy	1
slumbers	1
close,	1
The	1
weary	1
tale	1
of	1
my	1
unnumbered	1
woes	1
To	1
Chloris	1
and	1
to	1
Heaven	1
is	1
wont	1
to	1
rise.	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
day	1
returning	1
dyes	1
The	1
portals	1
of	1
the	1
east	1
with	1
tints	1
of	1
rose,	1
With	1
undiminished	1
force	1
my	1
sorrow	1
flows	1
In	1
broken	1
accents	1
and	1
in	1
burning	1
sighs.	1
And	1
when	1
the	1
sun	1
ascends	1
his	1
star-girt	1
throne,	1
And	1
on	1
the	1
earth	1
pours	1
down	1
his	1
midday	1
beams,	1
Noon	1
but	1
renews	1
my	1
wailing	1
and	1
my	1
tears;	1
And	1
with	1
the	1
night	1
again	1
goes	1
up	1
my	1
moan.	1
Yet	1
ever	1
in	1
my	1
agony	1
it	1
seems	1
To	1
me	1
that	1
neither	1
Heaven	1
nor	1
Chloris	1
hears.”	1
The	1
sonnet	1
pleased	1
Camilla,	1
and	1
still	1
more	1
Anselmo,	1
for	1
he	1
praised	1
it	1
and	1
said	1
the	1
lady	1
was	1
excessively	1
cruel	1
who	1
made	1
no	1
return	1
for	1
sincerity	1
so	1
manifest.	1
On	1
which	1
Camilla	1
said,	1
“Then	1
all	1
that	1
love-smitten	1
poets	1
say	1
is	1
true?”	1
“As	1
poets	1
they	1
do	1
not	1
tell	1
the	1
truth,”	1
replied	1
Lothario;	1
“but	1
as	1
lovers	1
they	1
are	1
not	1
more	1
defective	1
in	1
expression	1
than	1
they	1
are	1
truthful.”	1
“There	1
is	1
no	1
doubt	1
of	1
that,”	1
observed	1
Anselmo,	1
anxious	1
to	1
support	1
and	1
uphold	1
Lothario’s	1
ideas	1
with	1
Camilla,	1
who	1
was	1
as	1
regardless	1
of	1
his	1
design	1
as	1
she	1
was	1
deep	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
Lothario;	1
and	1
so	1
taking	1
delight	1
in	1
anything	1
that	1
was	1
his,	1
and	1
knowing	1
that	1
his	1
thoughts	1
and	1
writings	1
had	1
her	1
for	1
their	1
object,	1
and	1
that	1
she	1
herself	1
was	1
the	1
real	1
Chloris,	1
she	1
asked	1
him	1
to	1
repeat	1
some	1
other	1
sonnet	1
or	1
verses	1
if	1
he	1
recollected	1
any.	1
“I	1
do,”	1
replied	1
Lothario,	1
“but	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
think	1
it	1
as	1
good	1
as	1
the	1
first	1
one,	1
or,	1
more	1
correctly	1
speaking,	1
less	1
bad;	1
but	1
you	1
can	1
easily	1
judge,	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
this.	1
SONNET	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
doomed;	1
death	1
is	1
to	1
me	1
As	1
certain	1
as	1
that	1
thou,	1
ungrateful	1
fair,	1
Dead	1
at	1
thy	1
feet	1
shouldst	1
see	1
me	1
lying,	1
ere	1
My	1
heart	1
repented	1
of	1
its	1
love	1
for	1
thee.	1
If	1
buried	1
in	1
oblivion	1
I	1
should	1
be,	1
Bereft	1
of	1
life,	1
fame,	1
favour,	1
even	1
there	1
It	1
would	1
be	1
found	1
that	1
I	1
thy	1
image	1
bear	1
Deep	1
graven	1
in	1
my	1
breast	1
for	1
all	1
to	1
see.	1
This	1
like	1
some	1
holy	1
relic	1
do	1
I	1
prize	1
To	1
save	1
me	1
from	1
the	1
fate	1
my	1
truth	1
entails,	1
Truth	1
that	1
to	1
thy	1
hard	1
heart	1
its	1
vigour	1
owes.	1
Alas	1
for	1
him	1
that	1
under	1
lowering	1
skies,	1
In	1
peril	1
o’er	1
a	1
trackless	1
ocean	1
sails,	1
Where	1
neither	1
friendly	1
port	1
nor	1
pole-star	1
shows.”	1
Anselmo	1
praised	1
this	1
second	1
sonnet	1
too,	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
praised	1
the	1
first;	1
and	1
so	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
adding	1
link	1
after	1
link	1
to	1
the	1
chain	1
with	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
binding	1
himself	1
and	1
making	1
his	1
dishonour	1
secure;	1
for	1
when	1
Lothario	1
was	1
doing	1
most	1
to	1
dishonour	1
him	1
he	1
told	1
him	1
he	1
was	1
most	1
honoured;	1
and	1
thus	1
each	1
step	1
that	1
Camilla	1
descended	1
towards	1
the	1
depths	1
of	1
her	1
abasement,	1
she	1
mounted,	1
in	1
his	1
opinion,	1
towards	1
the	1
summit	1
of	1
virtue	1
and	1
fair	1
fame.	1
It	1
so	1
happened	1
that	1
finding	1
herself	1
on	1
one	1
occasion	1
alone	1
with	1
her	1
maid,	1
Camilla	1
said	1
to	1
her,	1
“I	1
am	1
ashamed	1
to	1
think,	1
my	1
dear	1
Leonela,	1
how	1
lightly	1
I	1
have	1
valued	1
myself	1
that	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
compel	1
Lothario	1
to	1
purchase	1
by	1
at	1
least	1
some	1
expenditure	1
of	1
time	1
that	1
full	1
possession	1
of	1
me	1
that	1
I	1
so	1
quickly	1
yielded	1
him	1
of	1
my	1
own	1
free	1
will.	1
I	1
fear	1
that	1
he	1
will	1
think	1
ill	1
of	1
my	1
pliancy	1
or	1
lightness,	1
not	1
considering	1
the	1
irresistible	1
influence	1
he	1
brought	1
to	1
bear	1
upon	1
me.”	1
“Let	1
not	1
that	1
trouble	1
you,	1
my	1
lady,”	1
said	1
Leonela,	1
“for	1
it	1
does	1
not	1
take	1
away	1
the	1
value	1
of	1
the	1
thing	1
given	1
or	1
make	1
it	1
the	1
less	1
precious	1
to	1
give	1
it	1
quickly	1
if	1
it	1
be	1
really	1
valuable	1
and	1
worthy	1
of	1
being	1
prized;	1
nay,	1
they	1
are	1
wont	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
he	1
who	1
gives	1
quickly	1
gives	1
twice.”	1
“They	1
say	1
also,”	1
said	1
Camilla,	1
“that	1
what	1
costs	1
little	1
is	1
valued	1
less.”	1
“That	1
saying	1
does	1
not	1
hold	1
good	1
in	1
your	1
case,”	1
replied	1
Leonela,	1
“for	1
love,	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
heard	1
say,	1
sometimes	1
flies	1
and	1
sometimes	1
walks;	1
with	1
this	1
one	1
it	1
runs,	1
with	1
that	1
it	1
moves	1
slowly;	1
some	1
it	1
cools,	1
others	1
it	1
burns;	1
some	1
it	1
wounds,	1
others	1
it	1
slays;	1
it	1
begins	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
its	1
desires,	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
moment	1
completes	1
and	1
ends	1
it;	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
it	1
will	1
lay	1
siege	1
to	1
a	1
fortress	1
and	1
by	1
night	1
will	1
have	1
taken	1
it,	1
for	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
power	1
that	1
can	1
resist	1
it;	1
so	1
what	1
are	1
you	1
in	1
dread	1
of,	1
what	1
do	1
you	1
fear,	1
when	1
the	1
same	1
must	1
have	1
befallen	1
Lothario,	1
love	1
having	1
chosen	1
the	1
absence	1
of	1
my	1
lord	1
as	1
the	1
instrument	1
for	1
subduing	1
you?	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
absolutely	1
necessary	1
to	1
complete	1
then	1
what	1
love	1
had	1
resolved	1
upon,	1
without	1
affording	1
the	1
time	1
to	1
let	1
Anselmo	1
return	1
and	1
by	1
his	1
presence	1
compel	1
the	1
work	1
to	1
be	1
left	1
unfinished;	1
for	1
love	1
has	1
no	1
better	1
agent	1
for	1
carrying	1
out	1
his	1
designs	1
than	1
opportunity;	1
and	1
of	1
opportunity	1
he	1
avails	1
himself	1
in	1
all	1
his	1
feats,	1
especially	1
at	1
the	1
outset.	1
All	1
this	1
I	1
know	1
well	1
myself,	1
more	1
by	1
experience	1
than	1
by	1
hearsay,	1
and	1
some	1
day,	1
señora,	1
I	1
will	1
enlighten	1
you	1
on	1
the	1
subject,	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
of	1
your	1
flesh	1
and	1
blood	1
too.	1
Moreover,	1
lady	1
Camilla,	1
you	1
did	1
not	1
surrender	1
yourself	1
or	1
yield	1
so	1
quickly	1
but	1
that	1
first	1
you	1
saw	1
Lothario’s	1
whole	1
soul	1
in	1
his	1
eyes,	1
in	1
his	1
sighs,	1
in	1
his	1
words,	1
his	1
promises	1
and	1
his	1
gifts,	1
and	1
by	1
it	1
and	1
his	1
good	1
qualities	1
perceived	1
how	1
worthy	1
he	1
was	1
of	1
your	1
love.	1
This,	1
then,	1
being	1
the	1
case,	1
let	1
not	1
these	1
scrupulous	1
and	1
prudish	1
ideas	1
trouble	1
your	1
imagination,	1
but	1
be	1
assured	1
that	1
Lothario	1
prizes	1
you	1
as	1
you	1
do	1
him,	1
and	1
rest	1
content	1
and	1
satisfied	1
that	1
as	1
you	1
are	1
caught	1
in	1
the	1
noose	1
of	1
love	1
it	1
is	1
one	1
of	1
worth	1
and	1
merit	1
that	1
has	1
taken	1
you,	1
and	1
one	1
that	1
has	1
not	1
only	1
the	1
four	1
S’s	1
that	1
they	1
say	1
true	1
lovers	1
ought	1
to	1
have,	1
but	1
a	1
complete	1
alphabet;	1
only	1
listen	1
to	1
me	1
and	1
you	1
will	1
see	1
how	1
I	1
can	1
repeat	1
it	1
by	1
rote.	1
He	1
is	1
to	1
my	1
eyes	1
and	1
thinking,	1
Amiable,	1
Brave,	1
Courteous,	1
Distinguished,	1
Elegant,	1
Fond,	1
Gay,	1
Honourable,	1
Illustrious,	1
Loyal,	1
Manly,	1
Noble,	1
Open,	1
Polite,	1
Quickwitted,	1
Rich,	1
and	1
the	1
S’s	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
saying,	1
and	1
then	1
Tender,	1
Veracious:	1
X	1
does	1
not	1
suit	1
him,	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
rough	1
letter;	1
Y	1
has	1
been	1
given	1
already;	1
and	1
Z	1
Zealous	1
for	1
your	1
honour.”	1
Camilla	1
laughed	1
at	1
her	1
maid’s	1
alphabet,	1
and	1
perceived	1
her	1
to	1
be	1
more	1
experienced	1
in	1
love	1
affairs	1
than	1
she	1
said,	1
which	1
she	1
admitted,	1
confessing	1
to	1
Camilla	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
love	1
passages	1
with	1
a	1
young	1
man	1
of	1
good	1
birth	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
city.	1
Camilla	1
was	1
uneasy	1
at	1
this,	1
dreading	1
lest	1
it	1
might	1
prove	1
the	1
means	1
of	1
endangering	1
her	1
honour,	1
and	1
asked	1
whether	1
her	1
intrigue	1
had	1
gone	1
beyond	1
words,	1
and	1
she	1
with	1
little	1
shame	1
and	1
much	1
effrontery	1
said	1
it	1
had;	1
for	1
certain	1
it	1
is	1
that	1
ladies’	1
imprudences	1
make	1
servants	1
shameless,	1
who,	1
when	1
they	1
see	1
their	1
mistresses	1
make	1
a	1
false	1
step,	1
think	1
nothing	1
of	1
going	1
astray	1
themselves,	1
or	1
of	1
its	1
being	1
known.	1
All	1
that	1
Camilla	1
could	1
do	1
was	1
to	1
entreat	1
Leonela	1
to	1
say	1
nothing	1
about	1
her	1
doings	1
to	1
him	1
whom	1
she	1
called	1
her	1
lover,	1
and	1
to	1
conduct	1
her	1
own	1
affairs	1
secretly	1
lest	1
they	1
should	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
Anselmo	1
or	1
of	1
Lothario.	1
Leonela	1
said	1
she	1
would,	1
but	1
kept	1
her	1
word	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
way	1
that	1
she	1
confirmed	1
Camilla’s	1
apprehension	1
of	1
losing	1
her	1
reputation	1
through	1
her	1
means;	1
for	1
this	1
abandoned	1
and	1
bold	1
Leonela,	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
she	1
perceived	1
that	1
her	1
mistress’s	1
demeanour	1
was	1
not	1
what	1
it	1
was	1
wont	1
to	1
be,	1
had	1
the	1
audacity	1
to	1
introduce	1
her	1
lover	1
into	1
the	1
house,	1
confident	1
that	1
even	1
if	1
her	1
mistress	1
saw	1
him	1
she	1
would	1
not	1
dare	1
to	1
expose	1
him;	1
for	1
the	1
sins	1
of	1
mistresses	1
entail	1
this	1
mischief	1
among	1
others;	1
they	1
make	1
themselves	1
the	1
slaves	1
of	1
their	1
own	1
servants,	1
and	1
are	1
obliged	1
to	1
hide	1
their	1
laxities	1
and	1
depravities;	1
as	1
was	1
the	1
case	1
with	1
Camilla,	1
who	1
though	1
she	1
perceived,	1
not	1
once	1
but	1
many	1
times,	1
that	1
Leonela	1
was	1
with	1
her	1
lover	1
in	1
some	1
room	1
of	1
the	1
house,	1
not	1
only	1
did	1
not	1
dare	1
to	1
chide	1
her,	1
but	1
afforded	1
her	1
opportunities	1
for	1
concealing	1
him	1
and	1
removed	1
all	1
difficulties,	1
lest	1
he	1
should	1
be	1
seen	1
by	1
her	1
husband.	1
She	1
was	1
unable,	1
however,	1
to	1
prevent	1
him	1
from	1
being	1
seen	1
on	1
one	1
occasion,	1
as	1
he	1
sallied	1
forth	1
at	1
daybreak,	1
by	1
Lothario,	1
who,	1
not	1
knowing	1
who	1
he	1
was,	1
at	1
first	1
took	1
him	1
for	1
a	1
spectre;	1
but,	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
saw	1
him	1
hasten	1
away,	1
muffling	1
his	1
face	1
with	1
his	1
cloak	1
and	1
concealing	1
himself	1
carefully	1
and	1
cautiously,	1
he	1
rejected	1
this	1
foolish	1
idea,	1
and	1
adopted	1
another,	1
which	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
the	1
ruin	1
of	1
all	1
had	1
not	1
Camilla	1
found	1
a	1
remedy.	1
It	1
did	1
not	1
occur	1
to	1
Lothario	1
that	1
this	1
man	1
he	1
had	1
seen	1
issuing	1
at	1
such	1
an	1
untimely	1
hour	1
from	1
Anselmo’s	1
house	1
could	1
have	1
entered	1
it	1
on	1
Leonela’s	1
account,	1
nor	1
did	1
he	1
even	1
remember	1
there	1
was	1
such	1
a	1
person	1
as	1
Leonela;	1
all	1
he	1
thought	1
was	1
that	1
as	1
Camilla	1
had	1
been	1
light	1
and	1
yielding	1
with	1
him,	1
so	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
with	1
another;	1
for	1
this	1
further	1
penalty	1
the	1
erring	1
woman’s	1
sin	1
brings	1
with	1
it,	1
that	1
her	1
honour	1
is	1
distrusted	1
even	1
by	1
him	1
to	1
whose	1
overtures	1
and	1
persuasions	1
she	1
has	1
yielded;	1
and	1
he	1
believes	1
her	1
to	1
have	1
surrendered	1
more	1
easily	1
to	1
others,	1
and	1
gives	1
implicit	1
credence	1
to	1
every	1
suspicion	1
that	1
comes	1
into	1
his	1
mind.	1
All	1
Lothario’s	1
good	1
sense	1
seems	1
to	1
have	1
failed	1
him	1
at	1
this	1
juncture;	1
all	1
his	1
prudent	1
maxims	1
escaped	1
his	1
memory;	1
for	1
without	1
once	1
reflecting	1
rationally,	1
and	1
without	1
more	1
ado,	1
in	1
his	1
impatience	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
blindness	1
of	1
the	1
jealous	1
rage	1
that	1
gnawed	1
his	1
heart,	1
and	1
dying	1
to	1
revenge	1
himself	1
upon	1
Camilla,	1
who	1
had	1
done	1
him	1
no	1
wrong,	1
before	1
Anselmo	1
had	1
risen	1
he	1
hastened	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
said	1
to	1
him,	1
“Know,	1
Anselmo,	1
that	1
for	1
several	1
days	1
past	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
struggling	1
with	1
myself,	1
striving	1
to	1
withhold	1
from	1
thee	1
what	1
it	1
is	1
no	1
longer	1
possible	1
or	1
right	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
conceal	1
from	1
thee.	1
Know	1
that	1
Camilla’s	1
fortress	1
has	1
surrendered	1
and	1
is	1
ready	1
to	1
submit	1
to	1
my	1
will;	1
and	1
if	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
slow	1
to	1
reveal	1
this	1
fact	1
to	1
thee,	1
it	1
was	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
see	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
some	1
light	1
caprice	1
of	1
hers,	1
or	1
if	1
she	1
sought	1
to	1
try	1
me	1
and	1
ascertain	1
if	1
the	1
love	1
I	1
began	1
to	1
make	1
to	1
her	1
with	1
thy	1
permission	1
was	1
made	1
with	1
a	1
serious	1
intention.	1
I	1
thought,	1
too,	1
that	1
she,	1
if	1
she	1
were	1
what	1
she	1
ought	1
to	1
be,	1
and	1
what	1
we	1
both	1
believed	1
her,	1
would	1
have	1
ere	1
this	1
given	1
thee	1
information	1
of	1
my	1
addresses;	1
but	1
seeing	1
that	1
she	1
delays,	1
I	1
believe	1
the	1
truth	1
of	1
the	1
promise	1
she	1
has	1
given	1
me	1
that	1
the	1
next	1
time	1
thou	1
art	1
absent	1
from	1
the	1
house	1
she	1
will	1
grant	1
me	1
an	1
interview	1
in	1
the	1
closet	1
where	1
thy	1
jewels	1
are	1
kept	1
(and	1
it	1
was	1
true	1
that	1
Camilla	1
used	1
to	1
meet	1
him	1
there);	1
but	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
wish	1
thee	1
to	1
rush	1
precipitately	1
to	1
take	1
vengeance,	1
for	1
the	1
sin	1
is	1
as	1
yet	1
only	1
committed	1
in	1
intention,	1
and	1
Camilla’s	1
may	1
change	1
perhaps	1
between	1
this	1
and	1
the	1
appointed	1
time,	1
and	1
repentance	1
spring	1
up	1
in	1
its	1
place.	1
As	1
hitherto	1
thou	1
hast	1
always	1
followed	1
my	1
advice	1
wholly	1
or	1
in	1
part,	1
follow	1
and	1
observe	1
this	1
that	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
thee	1
now,	1
so	1
that,	1
without	1
mistake,	1
and	1
with	1
mature	1
deliberation,	1
thou	1
mayest	1
satisfy	1
thyself	1
as	1
to	1
what	1
may	1
seem	1
the	1
best	1
course;	1
pretend	1
to	1
absent	1
thyself	1
for	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
days	1
as	1
thou	1
hast	1
been	1
wont	1
to	1
do	1
on	1
other	1
occasions,	1
and	1
contrive	1
to	1
hide	1
thyself	1
in	1
the	1
closet;	1
for	1
the	1
tapestries	1
and	1
other	1
things	1
there	1
afford	1
great	1
facilities	1
for	1
thy	1
concealment,	1
and	1
then	1
thou	1
wilt	1
see	1
with	1
thine	1
own	1
eyes	1
and	1
I	1
with	1
mine	1
what	1
Camilla’s	1
purpose	1
may	1
be.	1
And	1
if	1
it	1
be	1
a	1
guilty	1
one,	1
which	1
may	1
be	1
feared	1
rather	1
than	1
expected,	1
with	1
silence,	1
prudence,	1
and	1
discretion	1
thou	1
canst	1
thyself	1
become	1
the	1
instrument	1
of	1
punishment	1
for	1
the	1
wrong	1
done	1
thee.”	1
Anselmo	1
was	1
amazed,	1
overwhelmed,	1
and	1
astounded	1
at	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
Lothario,	1
which	1
came	1
upon	1
him	1
at	1
a	1
time	1
when	1
he	1
least	1
expected	1
to	1
hear	1
them,	1
for	1
he	1
now	1
looked	1
upon	1
Camilla	1
as	1
having	1
triumphed	1
over	1
the	1
pretended	1
attacks	1
of	1
Lothario,	1
and	1
was	1
beginning	1
to	1
enjoy	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
her	1
victory.	1
He	1
remained	1
silent	1
for	1
a	1
considerable	1
time,	1
looking	1
on	1
the	1
ground	1
with	1
fixed	1
gaze,	1
and	1
at	1
length	1
said,	1
“Thou	1
hast	1
behaved,	1
Lothario,	1
as	1
I	1
expected	1
of	1
thy	1
friendship:	1
I	1
will	1
follow	1
thy	1
advice	1
in	1
everything;	1
do	1
as	1
thou	1
wilt,	1
and	1
keep	1
this	1
secret	1
as	1
thou	1
seest	1
it	1
should	1
be	1
kept	1
in	1
circumstances	1
so	1
unlooked	1
for.”	1
Lothario	1
gave	1
him	1
his	1
word,	1
but	1
after	1
leaving	1
him	1
he	1
repented	1
altogether	1
of	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
said	1
to	1
him,	1
perceiving	1
how	1
foolishly	1
he	1
had	1
acted,	1
as	1
he	1
might	1
have	1
revenged	1
himself	1
upon	1
Camilla	1
in	1
some	1
less	1
cruel	1
and	1
degrading	1
way.	1
He	1
cursed	1
his	1
want	1
of	1
sense,	1
condemned	1
his	1
hasty	1
resolution,	1
and	1
knew	1
not	1
what	1
course	1
to	1
take	1
to	1
undo	1
the	1
mischief	1
or	1
find	1
some	1
ready	1
escape	1
from	1
it.	1
At	1
last	1
he	1
decided	1
upon	1
revealing	1
all	1
to	1
Camilla,	1
and,	1
as	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
want	1
of	1
opportunity	1
for	1
doing	1
so,	1
he	1
found	1
her	1
alone	1
the	1
same	1
day;	1
but	1
she,	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
she	1
had	1
the	1
chance	1
of	1
speaking	1
to	1
him,	1
said,	1
“Lothario	1
my	1
friend,	1
I	1
must	1
tell	1
thee	1
I	1
have	1
a	1
sorrow	1
in	1
my	1
heart	1
which	1
fills	1
it	1
so	1
that	1
it	1
seems	1
ready	1
to	1
burst;	1
and	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
a	1
wonder	1
if	1
it	1
does	1
not;	1
for	1
the	1
audacity	1
of	1
Leonela	1
has	1
now	1
reached	1
such	1
a	1
pitch	1
that	1
every	1
night	1
she	1
conceals	1
a	1
gallant	1
of	1
hers	1
in	1
this	1
house	1
and	1
remains	1
with	1
him	1
till	1
morning,	1
at	1
the	1
expense	1
of	1
my	1
reputation;	1
inasmuch	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
open	1
to	1
anyone	1
to	1
question	1
it	1
who	1
may	1
see	1
him	1
quitting	1
my	1
house	1
at	1
such	1
unseasonable	1
hours;	1
but	1
what	1
distresses	1
me	1
is	1
that	1
I	1
cannot	1
punish	1
or	1
chide	1
her,	1
for	1
her	1
privity	1
to	1
our	1
intrigue	1
bridles	1
my	1
mouth	1
and	1
keeps	1
me	1
silent	1
about	1
hers,	1
while	1
I	1
am	1
dreading	1
that	1
some	1
catastrophe	1
will	1
come	1
of	1
it.”	1
As	1
Camilla	1
said	1
this	1
Lothario	1
at	1
first	1
imagined	1
it	1
was	1
some	1
device	1
to	1
delude	1
him	1
into	1
the	1
idea	1
that	1
the	1
man	1
he	1
had	1
seen	1
going	1
out	1
was	1
Leonela’s	1
lover	1
and	1
not	1
hers;	1
but	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
how	1
she	1
wept	1
and	1
suffered,	1
and	1
begged	1
him	1
to	1
help	1
her,	1
he	1
became	1
convinced	1
of	1
the	1
truth,	1
and	1
the	1
conviction	1
completed	1
his	1
confusion	1
and	1
remorse;	1
however,	1
he	1
told	1
Camilla	1
not	1
to	1
distress	1
herself,	1
as	1
he	1
would	1
take	1
measures	1
to	1
put	1
a	1
stop	1
to	1
the	1
insolence	1
of	1
Leonela.	1
At	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
he	1
told	1
her	1
what,	1
driven	1
by	1
the	1
fierce	1
rage	1
of	1
jealousy,	1
he	1
had	1
said	1
to	1
Anselmo,	1
and	1
how	1
he	1
had	1
arranged	1
to	1
hide	1
himself	1
in	1
the	1
closet	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
there	1
see	1
plainly	1
how	1
little	1
she	1
preserved	1
her	1
fidelity	1
to	1
him;	1
and	1
he	1
entreated	1
her	1
pardon	1
for	1
this	1
madness,	1
and	1
her	1
advice	1
as	1
to	1
how	1
to	1
repair	1
it,	1
and	1
escape	1
safely	1
from	1
the	1
intricate	1
labyrinth	1
in	1
which	1
his	1
imprudence	1
had	1
involved	1
him.	1
Camilla	1
was	1
struck	1
with	1
alarm	1
at	1
hearing	1
what	1
Lothario	1
said,	1
and	1
with	1
much	1
anger,	1
and	1
great	1
good	1
sense,	1
she	1
reproved	1
him	1
and	1
rebuked	1
his	1
base	1
design	1
and	1
the	1
foolish	1
and	1
mischievous	1
resolution	1
he	1
had	1
made;	1
but	1
as	1
woman	1
has	1
by	1
nature	1
a	1
nimbler	1
wit	1
than	1
man	1
for	1
good	1
and	1
for	1
evil,	1
though	1
it	1
is	1
apt	1
to	1
fail	1
when	1
she	1
sets	1
herself	1
deliberately	1
to	1
reason,	1
Camilla	1
on	1
the	1
spur	1
of	1
the	1
moment	1
thought	1
of	1
a	1
way	1
to	1
remedy	1
what	1
was	1
to	1
all	1
appearance	1
irremediable,	1
and	1
told	1
Lothario	1
to	1
contrive	1
that	1
the	1
next	1
day	1
Anselmo	1
should	1
conceal	1
himself	1
in	1
the	1
place	1
he	1
mentioned,	1
for	1
she	1
hoped	1
from	1
his	1
concealment	1
to	1
obtain	1
the	1
means	1
of	1
their	1
enjoying	1
themselves	1
for	1
the	1
future	1
without	1
any	1
apprehension;	1
and	1
without	1
revealing	1
her	1
purpose	1
to	1
him	1
entirely	1
she	1
charged	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
careful,	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
Anselmo	1
was	1
concealed,	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
her	1
when	1
Leonela	1
should	1
call	1
him,	1
and	1
to	1
all	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
him	1
to	1
answer	1
as	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
answered	1
had	1
he	1
not	1
known	1
that	1
Anselmo	1
was	1
listening.	1
Lothario	1
pressed	1
her	1
to	1
explain	1
her	1
intention	1
fully,	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
with	1
more	1
certainty	1
and	1
precaution	1
take	1
care	1
to	1
do	1
what	1
he	1
saw	1
to	1
be	1
needful.	1
“I	1
tell	1
you,”	1
said	1
Camilla,	1
“there	1
is	1
nothing	1
to	1
take	1
care	1
of	1
except	1
to	1
answer	1
me	1
what	1
I	1
shall	1
ask	1
you;”	1
for	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
wish	1
to	1
explain	1
to	1
him	1
beforehand	1
what	1
she	1
meant	1
to	1
do,	1
fearing	1
lest	1
he	1
should	1
be	1
unwilling	1
to	1
follow	1
out	1
an	1
idea	1
which	1
seemed	1
to	1
her	1
such	1
a	1
good	1
one,	1
and	1
should	1
try	1
or	1
devise	1
some	1
other	1
less	1
practicable	1
plan.	1
Lothario	1
then	1
retired,	1
and	1
the	1
next	1
day	1
Anselmo,	1
under	1
pretence	1
of	1
going	1
to	1
his	1
friend’s	1
country	1
house,	1
took	1
his	1
departure,	1
and	1
then	1
returned	1
to	1
conceal	1
himself,	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
able	1
to	1
do	1
easily,	1
as	1
Camilla	1
and	1
Leonela	1
took	1
care	1
to	1
give	1
him	1
the	1
opportunity;	1
and	1
so	1
he	1
placed	1
himself	1
in	1
hiding	1
in	1
the	1
state	1
of	1
agitation	1
that	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
imagined	1
he	1
would	1
feel	1
who	1
expected	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
vitals	1
of	1
his	1
honour	1
laid	1
bare	1
before	1
his	1
eyes,	1
and	1
found	1
himself	1
on	1
the	1
point	1
of	1
losing	1
the	1
supreme	1
blessing	1
he	1
thought	1
he	1
possessed	1
in	1
his	1
beloved	1
Camilla.	1
Having	1
made	1
sure	1
of	1
Anselmo’s	1
being	1
in	1
his	1
hiding-place,	1
Camilla	1
and	1
Leonela	1
entered	1
the	1
closet,	1
and	1
the	1
instant	1
she	1
set	1
foot	1
within	1
it	1
Camilla	1
said,	1
with	1
a	1
deep	1
sigh,	1
“Ah!	1
dear	1
Leonela,	1
would	1
it	1
not	1
be	1
better,	1
before	1
I	1
do	1
what	1
I	1
am	1
unwilling	1
you	1
should	1
know	1
lest	1
you	1
should	1
seek	1
to	1
prevent	1
it,	1
that	1
you	1
should	1
take	1
Anselmo’s	1
dagger	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
asked	1
of	1
you	1
and	1
with	1
it	1
pierce	1
this	1
vile	1
heart	1
of	1
mine?	1
But	1
no;	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
reason	1
why	1
I	1
should	1
suffer	1
the	1
punishment	1
of	1
another’s	1
fault.	1
I	1
will	1
first	1
know	1
what	1
it	1
is	1
that	1
the	1
bold	1
licentious	1
eyes	1
of	1
Lothario	1
have	1
seen	1
in	1
me	1
that	1
could	1
have	1
encouraged	1
him	1
to	1
reveal	1
to	1
me	1
a	1
design	1
so	1
base	1
as	1
that	1
which	1
he	1
has	1
disclosed	1
regardless	1
of	1
his	1
friend	1
and	1
of	1
my	1
honour.	1
Go	1
to	1
the	1
window,	1
Leonela,	1
and	1
call	1
him,	1
for	1
no	1
doubt	1
he	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
street	1
waiting	1
to	1
carry	1
out	1
his	1
vile	1
project;	1
but	1
mine,	1
cruel	1
it	1
may	1
be,	1
but	1
honourable,	1
shall	1
be	1
carried	1
out	1
first.”	1
“Ah,	1
señora,”	1
said	1
the	1
crafty	1
Leonela,	1
who	1
knew	1
her	1
part,	1
“what	1
is	1
it	1
you	1
want	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
this	1
dagger?	1
Can	1
it	1
be	1
that	1
you	1
mean	1
to	1
take	1
your	1
own	1
life,	1
or	1
Lothario’s?	1
for	1
whichever	1
you	1
mean	1
to	1
do,	1
it	1
will	1
lead	1
to	1
the	1
loss	1
of	1
your	1
reputation	1
and	1
good	1
name.	1
It	1
is	1
better	1
to	1
dissemble	1
your	1
wrong	1
and	1
not	1
give	1
this	1
wicked	1
man	1
the	1
chance	1
of	1
entering	1
the	1
house	1
now	1
and	1
finding	1
us	1
alone;	1
consider,	1
señora,	1
we	1
are	1
weak	1
women	1
and	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
man,	1
and	1
determined,	1
and	1
as	1
he	1
comes	1
with	1
such	1
a	1
base	1
purpose,	1
blind	1
and	1
urged	1
by	1
passion,	1
perhaps	1
before	1
you	1
can	1
put	1
yours	1
into	1
execution	1
he	1
may	1
do	1
what	1
will	1
be	1
worse	1
for	1
you	1
than	1
taking	1
your	1
life.	1
Ill	1
betide	1
my	1
master,	1
Anselmo,	1
for	1
giving	1
such	1
authority	1
in	1
his	1
house	1
to	1
this	1
shameless	1
fellow!	1
And	1
supposing	1
you	1
kill	1
him,	1
señora,	1
as	1
I	1
suspect	1
you	1
mean	1
to	1
do,	1
what	1
shall	1
we	1
do	1
with	1
him	1
when	1
he	1
is	1
dead?”	1
“What,	1
my	1
friend?”	1
replied	1
Camilla,	1
“we	1
shall	1
leave	1
him	1
for	1
Anselmo	1
to	1
bury	1
him;	1
for	1
in	1
reason	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
to	1
him	1
a	1
light	1
labour	1
to	1
hide	1
his	1
own	1
infamy	1
under	1
ground.	1
Summon	1
him,	1
make	1
haste,	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
time	1
I	1
delay	1
in	1
taking	1
vengeance	1
for	1
my	1
wrong	1
seems	1
to	1
me	1
an	1
offence	1
against	1
the	1
loyalty	1
I	1
owe	1
my	1
husband.”	1
Anselmo	1
was	1
listening	1
to	1
all	1
this,	1
and	1
every	1
word	1
that	1
Camilla	1
uttered	1
made	1
him	1
change	1
his	1
mind;	1
but	1
when	1
he	1
heard	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
resolved	1
to	1
kill	1
Lothario	1
his	1
first	1
impulse	1
was	1
to	1
come	1
out	1
and	1
show	1
himself	1
to	1
avert	1
such	1
a	1
disaster;	1
but	1
in	1
his	1
anxiety	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
issue	1
of	1
a	1
resolution	1
so	1
bold	1
and	1
virtuous	1
he	1
restrained	1
himself,	1
intending	1
to	1
come	1
forth	1
in	1
time	1
to	1
prevent	1
the	1
deed.	1
At	1
this	1
moment	1
Camilla,	1
throwing	1
herself	1
upon	1
a	1
bed	1
that	1
was	1
close	1
by,	1
swooned	1
away,	1
and	1
Leonela	1
began	1
to	1
weep	1
bitterly,	1
exclaiming,	1
“Woe	1
is	1
me!	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
fated	1
to	1
have	1
dying	1
here	1
in	1
my	1
arms	1
the	1
flower	1
of	1
virtue	1
upon	1
earth,	1
the	1
crown	1
of	1
true	1
wives,	1
the	1
pattern	1
of	1
chastity!”	1
with	1
more	1
to	1
the	1
same	1
effect,	1
so	1
that	1
anyone	1
who	1
heard	1
her	1
would	1
have	1
taken	1
her	1
for	1
the	1
most	1
tender-hearted	1
and	1
faithful	1
handmaid	1
in	1
the	1
world,	1
and	1
her	1
mistress	1
for	1
another	1
persecuted	1
Penelope.	1
Camilla	1
was	1
not	1
long	1
in	1
recovering	1
from	1
her	1
fainting	1
fit	1
and	1
on	1
coming	1
to	1
herself	1
she	1
said,	1
“Why	1
do	1
you	1
not	1
go,	1
Leonela,	1
to	1
call	1
hither	1
that	1
friend,	1
the	1
falsest	1
to	1
his	1
friend	1
the	1
sun	1
ever	1
shone	1
upon	1
or	1
night	1
concealed?	1
Away,	1
run,	1
haste,	1
speed!	1
lest	1
the	1
fire	1
of	1
my	1
wrath	1
burn	1
itself	1
out	1
with	1
delay,	1
and	1
the	1
righteous	1
vengeance	1
that	1
I	1
hope	1
for	1
melt	1
away	1
in	1
menaces	1
and	1
maledictions.”	1
“I	1
am	1
just	1
going	1
to	1
call	1
him,	1
señora,”	1
said	1
Leonela;	1
“but	1
you	1
must	1
first	1
give	1
me	1
that	1
dagger,	1
lest	1
while	1
I	1
am	1
gone	1
you	1
should	1
by	1
means	1
of	1
it	1
give	1
cause	1
to	1
all	1
who	1
love	1
you	1
to	1
weep	1
all	1
their	1
lives.”	1
“Go	1
in	1
peace,	1
dear	1
Leonela,	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
do	1
so,”	1
said	1
Camilla,	1
“for	1
rash	1
and	1
foolish	1
as	1
I	1
may	1
be,	1
to	1
your	1
mind,	1
in	1
defending	1
my	1
honour,	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
going	1
to	1
be	1
so	1
much	1
so	1
as	1
that	1
Lucretia	1
who	1
they	1
say	1
killed	1
herself	1
without	1
having	1
done	1
anything	1
wrong,	1
and	1
without	1
having	1
first	1
killed	1
him	1
on	1
whom	1
the	1
guilt	1
of	1
her	1
misfortune	1
lay.	1
I	1
shall	1
die,	1
if	1
I	1
am	1
to	1
die;	1
but	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
after	1
full	1
vengeance	1
upon	1
him	1
who	1
has	1
brought	1
me	1
here	1
to	1
weep	1
over	1
audacity	1
that	1
no	1
fault	1
of	1
mine	1
gave	1
birth	1
to.”	1
Leonela	1
required	1
much	1
pressing	1
before	1
she	1
would	1
go	1
to	1
summon	1
Lothario,	1
but	1
at	1
last	1
she	1
went,	1
and	1
while	1
awaiting	1
her	1
return	1
Camilla	1
continued,	1
as	1
if	1
speaking	1
to	1
herself,	1
“Good	1
God!	1
would	1
it	1
not	1
have	1
been	1
more	1
prudent	1
to	1
have	1
repulsed	1
Lothario,	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
done	1
many	1
a	1
time	1
before,	1
than	1
to	1
allow	1
him,	1
as	1
I	1
am	1
now	1
doing,	1
to	1
think	1
me	1
unchaste	1
and	1
vile,	1
even	1
for	1
the	1
short	1
time	1
I	1
must	1
wait	1
until	1
I	1
undeceive	1
him?	1
No	1
doubt	1
it	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
better;	1
but	1
I	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
avenged,	1
nor	1
the	1
honour	1
of	1
my	1
husband	1
vindicated,	1
should	1
he	1
find	1
so	1
clear	1
and	1
easy	1
an	1
escape	1
from	1
the	1
strait	1
into	1
which	1
his	1
depravity	1
has	1
led	1
him.	1
Let	1
the	1
traitor	1
pay	1
with	1
his	1
life	1
for	1
the	1
temerity	1
of	1
his	1
wanton	1
wishes,	1
and	1
let	1
the	1
world	1
know	1
(if	1
haply	1
it	1
shall	1
ever	1
come	1
to	1
know)	1
that	1
Camilla	1
not	1
only	1
preserved	1
her	1
allegiance	1
to	1
her	1
husband,	1
but	1
avenged	1
him	1
of	1
the	1
man	1
who	1
dared	1
to	1
wrong	1
him.	1
Still,	1
I	1
think	1
it	1
might	1
be	1
better	1
to	1
disclose	1
this	1
to	1
Anselmo.	1
But	1
then	1
I	1
have	1
called	1
his	1
attention	1
to	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
letter	1
I	1
wrote	1
to	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
country,	1
and,	1
if	1
he	1
did	1
nothing	1
to	1
prevent	1
the	1
mischief	1
I	1
there	1
pointed	1
out	1
to	1
him,	1
I	1
suppose	1
it	1
was	1
that	1
from	1
pure	1
goodness	1
of	1
heart	1
and	1
trustfulness	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
and	1
could	1
not	1
believe	1
that	1
any	1
thought	1
against	1
his	1
honour	1
could	1
harbour	1
in	1
the	1
breast	1
of	1
so	1
stanch	1
a	1
friend;	1
nor	1
indeed	1
did	1
I	1
myself	1
believe	1
it	1
for	1
many	1
days,	1
nor	1
should	1
I	1
have	1
ever	1
believed	1
it	1
if	1
his	1
insolence	1
had	1
not	1
gone	1
so	1
far	1
as	1
to	1
make	1
it	1
manifest	1
by	1
open	1
presents,	1
lavish	1
promises,	1
and	1
ceaseless	1
tears.	1
But	1
why	1
do	1
I	1
argue	1
thus?	1
Does	1
a	1
bold	1
determination	1
stand	1
in	1
need	1
of	1
arguments?	1
Surely	1
not.	1
Then	1
traitors	1
avaunt!	1
Vengeance	1
to	1
my	1
aid!	1
Let	1
the	1
false	1
one	1
come,	1
approach,	1
advance,	1
die,	1
yield	1
up	1
his	1
life,	1
and	1
then	1
befall	1
what	1
may.	1
Pure	1
I	1
came	1
to	1
him	1
whom	1
Heaven	1
bestowed	1
upon	1
me,	1
pure	1
I	1
shall	1
leave	1
him;	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
worst	1
bathed	1
in	1
my	1
own	1
chaste	1
blood	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
foul	1
blood	1
of	1
the	1
falsest	1
friend	1
that	1
friendship	1
ever	1
saw	1
in	1
the	1
world;”	1
and	1
as	1
she	1
uttered	1
these	1
words	1
she	1
paced	1
the	1
room	1
holding	1
the	1
unsheathed	1
dagger,	1
with	1
such	1
irregular	1
and	1
disordered	1
steps,	1
and	1
such	1
gestures	1
that	1
one	1
would	1
have	1
supposed	1
her	1
to	1
have	1
lost	1
her	1
senses,	1
and	1
taken	1
her	1
for	1
some	1
violent	1
desperado	1
instead	1
of	1
a	1
delicate	1
woman.	1
Anselmo,	1
hidden	1
behind	1
some	1
tapestries	1
where	1
he	1
had	1
concealed	1
himself,	1
beheld	1
and	1
was	1
amazed	1
at	1
all,	1
and	1
already	1
felt	1
that	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
seen	1
and	1
heard	1
was	1
a	1
sufficient	1
answer	1
to	1
even	1
greater	1
suspicions;	1
and	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
now	1
well	1
pleased	1
if	1
the	1
proof	1
afforded	1
by	1
Lothario’s	1
coming	1
were	1
dispensed	1
with,	1
as	1
he	1
feared	1
some	1
sudden	1
mishap;	1
but	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
on	1
the	1
point	1
of	1
showing	1
himself	1
and	1
coming	1
forth	1
to	1
embrace	1
and	1
undeceive	1
his	1
wife	1
he	1
paused	1
as	1
he	1
saw	1
Leonela	1
returning,	1
leading	1
Lothario.	1
Camilla	1
when	1
she	1
saw	1
him,	1
drawing	1
a	1
long	1
line	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
her	1
on	1
the	1
floor	1
with	1
the	1
dagger,	1
said	1
to	1
him,	1
“Lothario,	1
pay	1
attention	1
to	1
what	1
I	1
say	1
to	1
thee:	1
if	1
by	1
any	1
chance	1
thou	1
darest	1
to	1
cross	1
this	1
line	1
thou	1
seest,	1
or	1
even	1
approach	1
it,	1
the	1
instant	1
I	1
see	1
thee	1
attempt	1
it	1
that	1
same	1
instant	1
will	1
I	1
pierce	1
my	1
bosom	1
with	1
this	1
dagger	1
that	1
I	1
hold	1
in	1
my	1
hand;	1
and	1
before	1
thou	1
answerest	1
me	1
a	1
word	1
desire	1
thee	1
to	1
listen	1
to	1
a	1
few	1
from	1
me,	1
and	1
afterwards	1
thou	1
shalt	1
reply	1
as	1
may	1
please	1
thee.	1
First,	1
I	1
desire	1
thee	1
to	1
tell	1
me,	1
Lothario,	1
if	1
thou	1
knowest	1
my	1
husband	1
Anselmo,	1
and	1
in	1
what	1
light	1
thou	1
regardest	1
him;	1
and	1
secondly	1
I	1
desire	1
to	1
know	1
if	1
thou	1
knowest	1
me	1
too.	1
Answer	1
me	1
this,	1
without	1
embarrassment	1
or	1
reflecting	1
deeply	1
what	1
thou	1
wilt	1
answer,	1
for	1
they	1
are	1
no	1
riddles	1
I	1
put	1
to	1
thee.”	1
Lothario	1
was	1
not	1
so	1
dull	1
but	1
that	1
from	1
the	1
first	1
moment	1
when	1
Camilla	1
directed	1
him	1
to	1
make	1
Anselmo	1
hide	1
himself	1
he	1
understood	1
what	1
she	1
intended	1
to	1
do,	1
and	1
therefore	1
he	1
fell	1
in	1
with	1
her	1
idea	1
so	1
readily	1
and	1
promptly	1
that	1
between	1
them	1
they	1
made	1
the	1
imposture	1
look	1
more	1
true	1
than	1
truth;	1
so	1
he	1
answered	1
her	1
thus:	1
“I	1
did	1
not	1
think,	1
fair	1
Camilla,	1
that	1
thou	1
wert	1
calling	1
me	1
to	1
ask	1
questions	1
so	1
remote	1
from	1
the	1
object	1
with	1
which	1
I	1
come;	1
but	1
if	1
it	1
is	1
to	1
defer	1
the	1
promised	1
reward	1
thou	1
art	1
doing	1
so,	1
thou	1
mightst	1
have	1
put	1
it	1
off	1
still	1
longer,	1
for	1
the	1
longing	1
for	1
happiness	1
gives	1
the	1
more	1
distress	1
the	1
nearer	1
comes	1
the	1
hope	1
of	1
gaining	1
it;	1
but	1
lest	1
thou	1
shouldst	1
say	1
that	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
answer	1
thy	1
questions,	1
I	1
say	1
that	1
I	1
know	1
thy	1
husband	1
Anselmo,	1
and	1
that	1
we	1
have	1
known	1
each	1
other	1
from	1
our	1
earliest	1
years;	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
speak	1
of	1
what	1
thou	1
too	1
knowest,	1
of	1
our	1
friendship,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
not	1
compel	1
myself	1
to	1
testify	1
against	1
the	1
wrong	1
that	1
love,	1
the	1
mighty	1
excuse	1
for	1
greater	1
errors,	1
makes	1
me	1
inflict	1
upon	1
him.	1
Thee	1
I	1
know	1
and	1
hold	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
estimation	1
as	1
he	1
does,	1
for	1
were	1
it	1
not	1
so	1
I	1
had	1
not	1
for	1
a	1
lesser	1
prize	1
acted	1
in	1
opposition	1
to	1
what	1
I	1
owe	1
to	1
my	1
station	1
and	1
the	1
holy	1
laws	1
of	1
true	1
friendship,	1
now	1
broken	1
and	1
violated	1
by	1
me	1
through	1
that	1
powerful	1
enemy,	1
love.”	1
“If	1
thou	1
dost	1
confess	1
that,”	1
returned	1
Camilla,	1
“mortal	1
enemy	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
rightly	1
deserves	1
to	1
be	1
loved,	1
with	1
what	1
face	1
dost	1
thou	1
dare	1
to	1
come	1
before	1
one	1
whom	1
thou	1
knowest	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
mirror	1
wherein	1
he	1
is	1
reflected	1
on	1
whom	1
thou	1
shouldst	1
look	1
to	1
see	1
how	1
unworthily	1
thou	1
wrongest	1
him?	1
But,	1
woe	1
is	1
me,	1
I	1
now	1
comprehend	1
what	1
has	1
made	1
thee	1
give	1
so	1
little	1
heed	1
to	1
what	1
thou	1
owest	1
to	1
thyself;	1
it	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
some	1
freedom	1
of	1
mine,	1
for	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
call	1
it	1
immodesty,	1
as	1
it	1
did	1
not	1
proceed	1
from	1
any	1
deliberate	1
intention,	1
but	1
from	1
some	1
heedlessness	1
such	1
as	1
women	1
are	1
guilty	1
of	1
through	1
inadvertence	1
when	1
they	1
think	1
they	1
have	1
no	1
occasion	1
for	1
reserve.	1
But	1
tell	1
me,	1
traitor,	1
when	1
did	1
I	1
by	1
word	1
or	1
sign	1
give	1
a	1
reply	1
to	1
thy	1
prayers	1
that	1
could	1
awaken	1
in	1
thee	1
a	1
shadow	1
of	1
hope	1
of	1
attaining	1
thy	1
base	1
wishes?	1
When	1
were	1
not	1
thy	1
professions	1
of	1
love	1
sternly	1
and	1
scornfully	1
rejected	1
and	1
rebuked?	1
When	1
were	1
thy	1
frequent	1
pledges	1
and	1
still	1
more	1
frequent	1
gifts	1
believed	1
or	1
accepted?	1
But	1
as	1
I	1
am	1
persuaded	1
that	1
no	1
one	1
can	1
long	1
persevere	1
in	1
the	1
attempt	1
to	1
win	1
love	1
unsustained	1
by	1
some	1
hope,	1
I	1
am	1
willing	1
to	1
attribute	1
to	1
myself	1
the	1
blame	1
of	1
thy	1
assurance,	1
for	1
no	1
doubt	1
some	1
thoughtlessness	1
of	1
mine	1
has	1
all	1
this	1
time	1
fostered	1
thy	1
hopes;	1
and	1
therefore	1
will	1
I	1
punish	1
myself	1
and	1
inflict	1
upon	1
myself	1
the	1
penalty	1
thy	1
guilt	1
deserves.	1
And	1
that	1
thou	1
mayest	1
see	1
that	1
being	1
so	1
relentless	1
to	1
myself	1
I	1
cannot	1
possibly	1
be	1
otherwise	1
to	1
thee,	1
I	1
have	1
summoned	1
thee	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
witness	1
of	1
the	1
sacrifice	1
I	1
mean	1
to	1
offer	1
to	1
the	1
injured	1
honour	1
of	1
my	1
honoured	1
husband,	1
wronged	1
by	1
thee	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
assiduity	1
thou	1
wert	1
capable	1
of,	1
and	1
by	1
me	1
too	1
through	1
want	1
of	1
caution	1
in	1
avoiding	1
every	1
occasion,	1
if	1
I	1
have	1
given	1
any,	1
of	1
encouraging	1
and	1
sanctioning	1
thy	1
base	1
designs.	1
Once	1
more	1
I	1
say	1
the	1
suspicion	1
in	1
my	1
mind	1
that	1
some	1
imprudence	1
of	1
mine	1
has	1
engendered	1
these	1
lawless	1
thoughts	1
in	1
thee,	1
is	1
what	1
causes	1
me	1
most	1
distress	1
and	1
what	1
I	1
desire	1
most	1
to	1
punish	1
with	1
my	1
own	1
hands,	1
for	1
were	1
any	1
other	1
instrument	1
of	1
punishment	1
employed	1
my	1
error	1
might	1
become	1
perhaps	1
more	1
widely	1
known;	1
but	1
before	1
I	1
do	1
so,	1
in	1
my	1
death	1
I	1
mean	1
to	1
inflict	1
death,	1
and	1
take	1
with	1
me	1
one	1
that	1
will	1
fully	1
satisfy	1
my	1
longing	1
for	1
the	1
revenge	1
I	1
hope	1
for	1
and	1
have;	1
for	1
I	1
shall	1
see,	1
wheresoever	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
that	1
I	1
go,	1
the	1
penalty	1
awarded	1
by	1
inflexible,	1
unswerving	1
justice	1
on	1
him	1
who	1
has	1
placed	1
me	1
in	1
a	1
position	1
so	1
desperate.”	1
As	1
she	1
uttered	1
these	1
words,	1
with	1
incredible	1
energy	1
and	1
swiftness	1
she	1
flew	1
upon	1
Lothario	1
with	1
the	1
naked	1
dagger,	1
so	1
manifestly	1
bent	1
on	1
burying	1
it	1
in	1
his	1
breast	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
almost	1
uncertain	1
whether	1
these	1
demonstrations	1
were	1
real	1
or	1
feigned,	1
for	1
he	1
was	1
obliged	1
to	1
have	1
recourse	1
to	1
all	1
his	1
skill	1
and	1
strength	1
to	1
prevent	1
her	1
from	1
striking	1
him;	1
and	1
with	1
such	1
reality	1
did	1
she	1
act	1
this	1
strange	1
farce	1
and	1
mystification	1
that,	1
to	1
give	1
it	1
a	1
colour	1
of	1
truth,	1
she	1
determined	1
to	1
stain	1
it	1
with	1
her	1
own	1
blood;	1
for	1
perceiving,	1
or	1
pretending,	1
that	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
wound	1
Lothario,	1
she	1
said,	1
“Fate,	1
it	1
seems,	1
will	1
not	1
grant	1
my	1
just	1
desire	1
complete	1
satisfaction,	1
but	1
it	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
keep	1
me	1
from	1
satisfying	1
it	1
partially	1
at	1
least;”	1
and	1
making	1
an	1
effort	1
to	1
free	1
the	1
hand	1
with	1
the	1
dagger	1
which	1
Lothario	1
held	1
in	1
his	1
grasp,	1
she	1
released	1
it,	1
and	1
directing	1
the	1
point	1
to	1
a	1
place	1
where	1
it	1
could	1
not	1
inflict	1
a	1
deep	1
wound,	1
she	1
plunged	1
it	1
into	1
her	1
left	1
side	1
high	1
up	1
close	1
to	1
the	1
shoulder,	1
and	1
then	1
allowed	1
herself	1
to	1
fall	1
to	1
the	1
ground	1
as	1
if	1
in	1
a	1
faint.	1
Leonela	1
and	1
Lothario	1
stood	1
amazed	1
and	1
astounded	1
at	1
the	1
catastrophe,	1
and	1
seeing	1
Camilla	1
stretched	1
on	1
the	1
ground	1
and	1
bathed	1
in	1
her	1
blood	1
they	1
were	1
still	1
uncertain	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
true	1
nature	1
of	1
the	1
act.	1
Lothario,	1
terrified	1
and	1
breathless,	1
ran	1
in	1
haste	1
to	1
pluck	1
out	1
the	1
dagger;	1
but	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
how	1
slight	1
the	1
wound	1
was	1
he	1
was	1
relieved	1
of	1
his	1
fears	1
and	1
once	1
more	1
admired	1
the	1
subtlety,	1
coolness,	1
and	1
ready	1
wit	1
of	1
the	1
fair	1
Camilla;	1
and	1
the	1
better	1
to	1
support	1
the	1
part	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
play	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
utter	1
profuse	1
and	1
doleful	1
lamentations	1
over	1
her	1
body	1
as	1
if	1
she	1
were	1
dead,	1
invoking	1
maledictions	1
not	1
only	1
on	1
himself	1
but	1
also	1
on	1
him	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
the	1
means	1
of	1
placing	1
him	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
position:	1
and	1
knowing	1
that	1
his	1
friend	1
Anselmo	1
heard	1
him	1
he	1
spoke	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
way	1
as	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
listener	1
feel	1
much	1
more	1
pity	1
for	1
him	1
than	1
for	1
Camilla,	1
even	1
though	1
he	1
supposed	1
her	1
dead.	1
Leonela	1
took	1
her	1
up	1
in	1
her	1
arms	1
and	1
laid	1
her	1
on	1
the	1
bed,	1
entreating	1
Lothario	1
to	1
go	1
in	1
quest	1
of	1
someone	1
to	1
attend	1
to	1
her	1
wound	1
in	1
secret,	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
asking	1
his	1
advice	1
and	1
opinion	1
as	1
to	1
what	1
they	1
should	1
say	1
to	1
Anselmo	1
about	1
his	1
lady’s	1
wound	1
if	1
he	1
should	1
chance	1
to	1
return	1
before	1
it	1
was	1
healed.	1
He	1
replied	1
they	1
might	1
say	1
what	1
they	1
liked,	1
for	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
in	1
a	1
state	1
to	1
give	1
advice	1
that	1
would	1
be	1
of	1
any	1
use;	1
all	1
he	1
could	1
tell	1
her	1
was	1
to	1
try	1
and	1
stanch	1
the	1
blood,	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
going	1
where	1
he	1
should	1
never	1
more	1
be	1
seen;	1
and	1
with	1
every	1
appearance	1
of	1
deep	1
grief	1
and	1
sorrow	1
he	1
left	1
the	1
house;	1
but	1
when	1
he	1
found	1
himself	1
alone,	1
and	1
where	1
there	1
was	1
nobody	1
to	1
see	1
him,	1
he	1
crossed	1
himself	1
unceasingly,	1
lost	1
in	1
wonder	1
at	1
the	1
adroitness	1
of	1
Camilla	1
and	1
the	1
consistent	1
acting	1
of	1
Leonela.	1
He	1
reflected	1
how	1
convinced	1
Anselmo	1
would	1
be	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
a	1
second	1
Portia	1
for	1
a	1
wife,	1
and	1
he	1
looked	1
forward	1
anxiously	1
to	1
meeting	1
him	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
rejoice	1
together	1
over	1
falsehood	1
and	1
truth	1
the	1
most	1
craftily	1
veiled	1
that	1
could	1
be	1
imagined.	1
Leonela,	1
as	1
he	1
told	1
her,	1
stanched	1
her	1
lady’s	1
blood,	1
which	1
was	1
no	1
more	1
than	1
sufficed	1
to	1
support	1
her	1
deception;	1
and	1
washing	1
the	1
wound	1
with	1
a	1
little	1
wine	1
she	1
bound	1
it	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
best	1
of	1
her	1
skill,	1
talking	1
all	1
the	1
time	1
she	1
was	1
tending	1
her	1
in	1
a	1
strain	1
that,	1
even	1
if	1
nothing	1
else	1
had	1
been	1
said	1
before,	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
enough	1
to	1
assure	1
Anselmo	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
in	1
Camilla	1
a	1
model	1
of	1
purity.	1
To	1
Leonela’s	1
words	1
Camilla	1
added	1
her	1
own,	1
calling	1
herself	1
cowardly	1
and	1
wanting	1
in	1
spirit,	1
since	1
she	1
had	1
not	1
enough	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
she	1
had	1
most	1
need	1
of	1
it	1
to	1
rid	1
herself	1
of	1
the	1
life	1
she	1
so	1
much	1
loathed.	1
She	1
asked	1
her	1
attendant’s	1
advice	1
as	1
to	1
whether	1
or	1
not	1
she	1
ought	1
to	1
inform	1
her	1
beloved	1
husband	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
had	1
happened,	1
but	1
the	1
other	1
bade	1
her	1
say	1
nothing	1
about	1
it,	1
as	1
she	1
would	1
lay	1
upon	1
him	1
the	1
obligation	1
of	1
taking	1
vengeance	1
on	1
Lothario,	1
which	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
do	1
but	1
at	1
great	1
risk	1
to	1
himself;	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
duty	1
of	1
a	1
true	1
wife	1
not	1
to	1
give	1
her	1
husband	1
provocation	1
to	1
quarrel,	1
but,	1
on	1
the	1
contrary,	1
to	1
remove	1
it	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
possible	1
from	1
him.	1
Camilla	1
replied	1
that	1
she	1
believed	1
she	1
was	1
right	1
and	1
that	1
she	1
would	1
follow	1
her	1
advice,	1
but	1
at	1
any	1
rate	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
well	1
to	1
consider	1
how	1
she	1
was	1
to	1
explain	1
the	1
wound	1
to	1
Anselmo,	1
for	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
seeing	1
it;	1
to	1
which	1
Leonela	1
answered	1
that	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
how	1
to	1
tell	1
a	1
lie	1
even	1
in	1
jest.	1
“How	1
then	1
can	1
I	1
know,	1
my	1
dear?”	1
said	1
Camilla,	1
“for	1
I	1
should	1
not	1
dare	1
to	1
forge	1
or	1
keep	1
up	1
a	1
falsehood	1
if	1
my	1
life	1
depended	1
on	1
it.	1
If	1
we	1
can	1
think	1
of	1
no	1
escape	1
from	1
this	1
difficulty,	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
better	1
to	1
tell	1
him	1
the	1
plain	1
truth	1
than	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
find	1
us	1
out	1
in	1
an	1
untrue	1
story.”	1
“Be	1
not	1
uneasy,	1
señora,”	1
said	1
Leonela;	1
“between	1
this	1
and	1
to-morrow	1
I	1
will	1
think	1
of	1
what	1
we	1
must	1
say	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
perhaps	1
the	1
wound	1
being	1
where	1
it	1
is	1
it	1
can	1
be	1
hidden	1
from	1
his	1
sight,	1
and	1
Heaven	1
will	1
be	1
pleased	1
to	1
aid	1
us	1
in	1
a	1
purpose	1
so	1
good	1
and	1
honourable.	1
Compose	1
yourself,	1
señora,	1
and	1
endeavour	1
to	1
calm	1
your	1
excitement	1
lest	1
my	1
lord	1
find	1
you	1
agitated;	1
and	1
leave	1
the	1
rest	1
to	1
my	1
care	1
and	1
God’s,	1
who	1
always	1
supports	1
good	1
intentions.”	1
Anselmo	1
had	1
with	1
the	1
deepest	1
attention	1
listened	1
to	1
and	1
seen	1
played	1
out	1
the	1
tragedy	1
of	1
the	1
death	1
of	1
his	1
honour,	1
which	1
the	1
performers	1
acted	1
with	1
such	1
wonderfully	1
effective	1
truth	1
that	1
it	1
seemed	1
as	1
if	1
they	1
had	1
become	1
the	1
realities	1
of	1
the	1
parts	1
they	1
played.	1
He	1
longed	1
for	1
night	1
and	1
an	1
opportunity	1
of	1
escaping	1
from	1
the	1
house	1
to	1
go	1
and	1
see	1
his	1
good	1
friend	1
Lothario,	1
and	1
with	1
him	1
give	1
vent	1
to	1
his	1
joy	1
over	1
the	1
precious	1
pearl	1
he	1
had	1
gained	1
in	1
having	1
established	1
his	1
wife’s	1
purity.	1
Both	1
mistress	1
and	1
maid	1
took	1
care	1
to	1
give	1
him	1
time	1
and	1
opportunity	1
to	1
get	1
away,	1
and	1
taking	1
advantage	1
of	1
it	1
he	1
made	1
his	1
escape,	1
and	1
at	1
once	1
went	1
in	1
quest	1
of	1
Lothario,	1
and	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
impossible	1
to	1
describe	1
how	1
he	1
embraced	1
him	1
when	1
he	1
found	1
him,	1
and	1
the	1
things	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
joy	1
of	1
his	1
heart,	1
and	1
the	1
praises	1
he	1
bestowed	1
upon	1
Camilla;	1
all	1
which	1
Lothario	1
listened	1
to	1
without	1
being	1
able	1
to	1
show	1
any	1
pleasure,	1
for	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
forget	1
how	1
deceived	1
his	1
friend	1
was,	1
and	1
how	1
dishonourably	1
he	1
had	1
wronged	1
him;	1
and	1
though	1
Anselmo	1
could	1
see	1
that	1
Lothario	1
was	1
not	1
glad,	1
still	1
he	1
imagined	1
it	1
was	1
only	1
because	1
he	1
had	1
left	1
Camilla	1
wounded	1
and	1
had	1
been	1
himself	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
it;	1
and	1
so	1
among	1
other	1
things	1
he	1
told	1
him	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
distressed	1
about	1
Camilla’s	1
accident,	1
for,	1
as	1
they	1
had	1
agreed	1
to	1
hide	1
it	1
from	1
him,	1
the	1
wound	1
was	1
evidently	1
trifling;	1
and	1
that	1
being	1
so,	1
he	1
had	1
no	1
cause	1
for	1
fear,	1
but	1
should	1
henceforward	1
be	1
of	1
good	1
cheer	1
and	1
rejoice	1
with	1
him,	1
seeing	1
that	1
by	1
his	1
means	1
and	1
adroitness	1
he	1
found	1
himself	1
raised	1
to	1
the	1
greatest	1
height	1
of	1
happiness	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
have	1
ventured	1
to	1
hope	1
for,	1
and	1
desired	1
no	1
better	1
pastime	1
than	1
making	1
verses	1
in	1
praise	1
of	1
Camilla	1
that	1
would	1
preserve	1
her	1
name	1
for	1
all	1
time	1
to	1
come.	1
Lothario	1
commended	1
his	1
purpose,	1
and	1
promised	1
on	1
his	1
own	1
part	1
to	1
aid	1
him	1
in	1
raising	1
a	1
monument	1
so	1
glorious.	1
And	1
so	1
Anselmo	1
was	1
left	1
the	1
most	1
charmingly	1
hoodwinked	1
man	1
there	1
could	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
world.	1
He	1
himself,	1
persuaded	1
he	1
was	1
conducting	1
the	1
instrument	1
of	1
his	1
glory,	1
led	1
home	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
him	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
the	1
utter	1
destruction	1
of	1
his	1
good	1
name;	1
whom	1
Camilla	1
received	1
with	1
averted	1
countenance,	1
though	1
with	1
smiles	1
in	1
her	1
heart.	1
The	1
deception	1
was	1
carried	1
on	1
for	1
some	1
time,	1
until	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
a	1
few	1
months	1
Fortune	1
turned	1
her	1
wheel	1
and	1
the	1
guilt	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
until	1
then	1
so	1
skilfully	1
concealed	1
was	1
published	1
abroad,	1
and	1
Anselmo	1
paid	1
with	1
his	1
life	1
the	1
penalty	1
of	1
his	1
ill-advised	1
curiosity.	1

XXXV.	1
WHICH	1

OF	1
THE	1
HEROIC	1
AND	1
PRODIGIOUS	1
BATTLE	1
DON	1
QUIXOTE	1
HAD	1
WITH	1
CERTAIN	1
SKINS	1
OF	1
RED	1
WINE,	1
AND	1
BRINGS	1
THE	1
NOVEL	1
OF	1
“THE	1
ILL-ADVISED	1
CURIOSITY”	1
TO	1
A	1
CLOSE	1
There	1
remained	1
but	1
little	1
more	1
of	1
the	1
novel	1
to	1
be	1
read,	1
when	1
Sancho	1
Panza	1
burst	1
forth	1
in	1
wild	1
excitement	1
from	1
the	1
garret	1
where	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
was	1
lying,	1
shouting,	1
“Run,	1
sirs!	1
quick;	1
and	1
help	1
my	1
master,	1
who	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
thick	1
of	1
the	1
toughest	1
and	1
stiffest	1
battle	1
I	1
ever	1
laid	1
eyes	1
on.	1
By	1
the	1
living	1
God	1
he	1
has	1
given	1
the	1
giant,	1
the	1
enemy	1
of	1
my	1
lady	1
the	1
Princess	1
Micomicona,	1
such	1
a	1
slash	1
that	1
he	1
has	1
sliced	1
his	1
head	1
clean	1
off	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
a	1
turnip.”	1
“What	1
are	1
you	1
talking	1
about,	1
brother?”	1
said	1
the	1
curate,	1
pausing	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
read	1
the	1
remainder	1
of	1
the	1
novel.	1
“Are	1
you	1
in	1
your	1
senses,	1
Sancho?	1
How	1
the	1
devil	1
can	1
it	1
be	1
as	1
you	1
say,	1
when	1
the	1
giant	1
is	1
two	1
thousand	1
leagues	1
away?”	1
Here	1
they	1
heard	1
a	1
loud	1
noise	1
in	1
the	1
chamber,	1
and	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
shouting	1
out,	1
“Stand,	1
thief,	1
brigand,	1
villain;	1
now	1
I	1
have	1
got	1
thee,	1
and	1
thy	1
scimitar	1
shall	1
not	1
avail	1
thee!”	1
And	1
then	1
it	1
seemed	1
as	1
though	1
he	1
were	1
slashing	1
vigorously	1
at	1
the	1
wall.	1
“Don’t	1
stop	1
to	1
listen,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“but	1
go	1
in	1
and	1
part	1
them	1
or	1
help	1
my	1
master:	1
though	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
need	1
of	1
that	1
now,	1
for	1
no	1
doubt	1
the	1
giant	1
is	1
dead	1
by	1
this	1
time	1
and	1
giving	1
account	1
to	1
God	1
of	1
his	1
past	1
wicked	1
life;	1
for	1
I	1
saw	1
the	1
blood	1
flowing	1
on	1
the	1
ground,	1
and	1
the	1
head	1
cut	1
off	1
and	1
fallen	1
on	1
one	1
side,	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
as	1
big	1
as	1
a	1
large	1
wine-skin.”	1
“May	1
I	1
die,”	1
said	1
the	1
landlord	1
at	1
this,	1
“if	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
or	1
Don	1
Devil	1
has	1
not	1
been	1
slashing	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
skins	1
of	1
red	1
wine	1
that	1
stand	1
full	1
at	1
his	1
bed’s	1
head,	1
and	1
the	1
spilt	1
wine	1
must	1
be	1
what	1
this	1
good	1
fellow	1
takes	1
for	1
blood;”	1
and	1
so	1
saying	1
he	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
room	1
and	1
the	1
rest	1
after	1
him,	1
and	1
there	1
they	1
found	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
in	1
the	1
strangest	1
costume	1
in	1
the	1
world.	1
He	1
was	1
in	1
his	1
shirt,	1
which	1
was	1
not	1
long	1
enough	1
in	1
front	1
to	1
cover	1
his	1
thighs	1
completely	1
and	1
was	1
six	1
fingers	1
shorter	1
behind;	1
his	1
legs	1
were	1
very	1
long	1
and	1
lean,	1
covered	1
with	1
hair,	1
and	1
anything	1
but	1
clean;	1
on	1
his	1
head	1
he	1
had	1
a	1
little	1
greasy	1
red	1
cap	1
that	1
belonged	1
to	1
the	1
host,	1
round	1
his	1
left	1
arm	1
he	1
had	1
rolled	1
the	1
blanket	1
of	1
the	1
bed,	1
to	1
which	1
Sancho,	1
for	1
reasons	1
best	1
known	1
to	1
himself,	1
owed	1
a	1
grudge,	1
and	1
in	1
his	1
right	1
hand	1
he	1
held	1
his	1
unsheathed	1
sword,	1
with	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
slashing	1
about	1
on	1
all	1
sides,	1
uttering	1
exclamations	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
were	1
actually	1
fighting	1
some	1
giant:	1
and	1
the	1
best	1
of	1
it	1
was	1
his	1
eyes	1
were	1
not	1
open,	1
for	1
he	1
was	1
fast	1
asleep,	1
and	1
dreaming	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
doing	1
battle	1
with	1
the	1
giant.	1
For	1
his	1
imagination	1
was	1
so	1
wrought	1
upon	1
by	1
the	1
adventure	1
he	1
was	1
going	1
to	1
accomplish,	1
that	1
it	1
made	1
him	1
dream	1
he	1
had	1
already	1
reached	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
Micomicon,	1
and	1
was	1
engaged	1
in	1
combat	1
with	1
his	1
enemy;	1
and	1
believing	1
he	1
was	1
laying	1
on	1
the	1
giant,	1
he	1
had	1
given	1
so	1
many	1
sword	1
cuts	1
to	1
the	1
skins	1
that	1
the	1
whole	1
room	1
was	1
full	1
of	1
wine.	1
On	1
seeing	1
this	1
the	1
landlord	1
was	1
so	1
enraged	1
that	1
he	1
fell	1
on	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
and	1
with	1
his	1
clenched	1
fist	1
began	1
to	1
pummel	1
him	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
way,	1
that	1
if	1
Cardenio	1
and	1
the	1
curate	1
had	1
not	1
dragged	1
him	1
off,	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
brought	1
the	1
war	1
of	1
the	1
giant	1
to	1
an	1
end.	1
But	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
poor	1
gentleman	1
never	1
woke	1
until	1
the	1
barber	1
brought	1
a	1
great	1
pot	1
of	1
cold	1
water	1
from	1
the	1
well	1
and	1
flung	1
it	1
with	1
one	1
dash	1
all	1
over	1
his	1
body,	1
on	1
which	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
woke	1
up,	1
but	1
not	1
so	1
completely	1
as	1
to	1
understand	1
what	1
was	1
the	1
matter.	1
Dorothea,	1
seeing	1
how	1
short	1
and	1
slight	1
his	1
attire	1
was,	1
would	1
not	1
go	1
in	1
to	1
witness	1
the	1
battle	1
between	1
her	1
champion	1
and	1
her	1
opponent.	1
As	1
for	1
Sancho,	1
he	1
went	1
searching	1
all	1
over	1
the	1
floor	1
for	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
giant,	1
and	1
not	1
finding	1
it	1
he	1
said,	1
“I	1
see	1
now	1
that	1
it’s	1
all	1
enchantment	1
in	1
this	1
house;	1
for	1
the	1
last	1
time,	1
on	1
this	1
very	1
spot	1
where	1
I	1
am	1
now,	1
I	1
got	1
ever	1
so	1
many	1
thumps	1
without	1
knowing	1
who	1
gave	1
them	1
to	1
me,	1
or	1
being	1
able	1
to	1
see	1
anybody;	1
and	1
now	1
this	1
head	1
is	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
seen	1
anywhere	1
about,	1
though	1
I	1
saw	1
it	1
cut	1
off	1
with	1
my	1
own	1
eyes	1
and	1
the	1
blood	1
running	1
from	1
the	1
body	1
as	1
if	1
from	1
a	1
fountain.”	1
“What	1
blood	1
and	1
fountains	1
are	1
you	1
talking	1
about,	1
enemy	1
of	1
God	1
and	1
his	1
saints?”	1
said	1
the	1
landlord.	1
“Don’t	1
you	1
see,	1
you	1
thief,	1
that	1
the	1
blood	1
and	1
the	1
fountain	1
are	1
only	1
these	1
skins	1
here	1
that	1
have	1
been	1
stabbed	1
and	1
the	1
red	1
wine	1
swimming	1
all	1
over	1
the	1
room?—and	1
I	1
wish	1
I	1
saw	1
the	1
soul	1
of	1
him	1
that	1
stabbed	1
them	1
swimming	1
in	1
hell.”	1
“I	1
know	1
nothing	1
about	1
that,”	1
said	1
Sancho;	1
“all	1
I	1
know	1
is	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
my	1
bad	1
luck	1
that	1
through	1
not	1
finding	1
this	1
head	1
my	1
county	1
will	1
melt	1
away	1
like	1
salt	1
in	1
water;”—for	1
Sancho	1
awake	1
was	1
worse	1
than	1
his	1
master	1
asleep,	1
so	1
much	1
had	1
his	1
master’s	1
promises	1
addled	1
his	1
wits.	1
The	1
landlord	1
was	1
beside	1
himself	1
at	1
the	1
coolness	1
of	1
the	1
squire	1
and	1
the	1
mischievous	1
doings	1
of	1
the	1
master,	1
and	1
swore	1
it	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
like	1
the	1
last	1
time	1
when	1
they	1
went	1
without	1
paying;	1
and	1
that	1
their	1
privileges	1
of	1
chivalry	1
should	1
not	1
hold	1
good	1
this	1
time	1
to	1
let	1
one	1
or	1
other	1
of	1
them	1
off	1
without	1
paying,	1
even	1
to	1
the	1
cost	1
of	1
the	1
plugs	1
that	1
would	1
have	1
to	1
be	1
put	1
to	1
the	1
damaged	1
wine-skins.	1
The	1
curate	1
was	1
holding	1
Don	1
Quixote’s	1
hands,	1
who,	1
fancying	1
he	1
had	1
now	1
ended	1
the	1
adventure	1
and	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
the	1
Princess	1
Micomicona,	1
knelt	1
before	1
the	1
curate	1
and	1
said,	1
“Exalted	1
and	1
beauteous	1
lady,	1
your	1
highness	1
may	1
live	1
from	1
this	1
day	1
forth	1
fearless	1
of	1
any	1
harm	1
this	1
base	1
being	1
could	1
do	1
you;	1
and	1
I	1
too	1
from	1
this	1
day	1
forth	1
am	1
released	1
from	1
the	1
promise	1
I	1
gave	1
you,	1
since	1
by	1
the	1
help	1
of	1
God	1
on	1
high	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
favour	1
of	1
her	1
by	1
whom	1
I	1
live	1
and	1
breathe,	1
I	1
have	1
fulfilled	1
it	1
so	1
successfully.”	1
“Did	1
not	1
I	1
say	1
so?”	1
said	1
Sancho	1
on	1
hearing	1
this.	1
“You	1
see	1
I	1
wasn’t	1
drunk;	1
there	1
you	1
see	1
my	1
master	1
has	1
already	1
salted	1
the	1
giant;	1
there’s	1
no	1
doubt	1
about	1
the	1
bulls;	1
my	1
county	1
is	1
all	1
right!”	1
Who	1
could	1
have	1
helped	1
laughing	1
at	1
the	1
absurdities	1
of	1
the	1
pair,	1
master	1
and	1
man?	1
And	1
laugh	1
they	1
did,	1
all	1
except	1
the	1
landlord,	1
who	1
cursed	1
himself;	1
but	1
at	1
length	1
the	1
barber,	1
Cardenio,	1
and	1
the	1
curate	1
contrived	1
with	1
no	1
small	1
trouble	1
to	1
get	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
on	1
the	1
bed,	1
and	1
he	1
fell	1
asleep	1
with	1
every	1
appearance	1
of	1
excessive	1
weariness.	1
They	1
left	1
him	1
to	1
sleep,	1
and	1
came	1
out	1
to	1
the	1
gate	1
of	1
the	1
inn	1
to	1
console	1
Sancho	1
Panza	1
on	1
not	1
having	1
found	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
giant;	1
but	1
much	1
more	1
work	1
had	1
they	1
to	1
appease	1
the	1
landlord,	1
who	1
was	1
furious	1
at	1
the	1
sudden	1
death	1
of	1
his	1
wine-skins;	1
and	1
said	1
the	1
landlady	1
half	1
scolding,	1
half	1
crying,	1
“At	1
an	1
evil	1
moment	1
and	1
in	1
an	1
unlucky	1
hour	1
he	1
came	1
into	1
my	1
house,	1
this	1
knight-errant—would	1
that	1
I	1
had	1
never	1
set	1
eyes	1
on	1
him,	1
for	1
dear	1
he	1
has	1
cost	1
me;	1
the	1
last	1
time	1
he	1
went	1
off	1
with	1
the	1
overnight	1
score	1
against	1
him	1
for	1
supper,	1
bed,	1
straw,	1
and	1
barley,	1
for	1
himself	1
and	1
his	1
squire	1
and	1
a	1
hack	1
and	1
an	1
ass,	1
saying	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
knight	1
adventurer—God	1
send	1
unlucky	1
adventures	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
adventurers	1
in	1
the	1
world—and	1
therefore	1
not	1
bound	1
to	1
pay	1
anything,	1
for	1
it	1
was	1
so	1
settled	1
by	1
the	1
knight-errantry	1
tariff:	1
and	1
then,	1
all	1
because	1
of	1
him,	1
came	1
the	1
other	1
gentleman	1
and	1
carried	1
off	1
my	1
tail,	1
and	1
gives	1
it	1
back	1
more	1
than	1
two	1
cuartillos	1
the	1
worse,	1
all	1
stripped	1
of	1
its	1
hair,	1
so	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
no	1
use	1
for	1
my	1
husband’s	1
purpose;	1
and	1
then,	1
for	1
a	1
finishing	1
touch	1
to	1
all,	1
to	1
burst	1
my	1
wine-skins	1
and	1
spill	1
my	1
wine!	1
I	1
wish	1
I	1
saw	1
his	1
own	1
blood	1
spilt!	1
But	1
let	1
him	1
not	1
deceive	1
himself,	1
for,	1
by	1
the	1
bones	1
of	1
my	1
father	1
and	1
the	1
shade	1
of	1
my	1
mother,	1
they	1
shall	1
pay	1
me	1
down	1
every	1
quarts;	1
or	1
my	1
name	1
is	1
not	1
what	1
it	1
is,	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
my	1
father’s	1
daughter.”	1
All	1
this	1
and	1
more	1
to	1
the	1
same	1
effect	1
the	1
landlady	1
delivered	1
with	1
great	1
irritation,	1
and	1
her	1
good	1
maid	1
Maritornes	1
backed	1
her	1
up,	1
while	1
the	1
daughter	1
held	1
her	1
peace	1
and	1
smiled	1
from	1
time	1
to	1
time.	1
The	1
curate	1
smoothed	1
matters	1
by	1
promising	1
to	1
make	1
good	1
all	1
losses	1
to	1
the	1
best	1
of	1
his	1
power,	1
not	1
only	1
as	1
regarded	1
the	1
wine-skins	1
but	1
also	1
the	1
wine,	1
and	1
above	1
all	1
the	1
depreciation	1
of	1
the	1
tail	1
which	1
they	1
set	1
such	1
store	1
by.	1
Dorothea	1
comforted	1
Sancho,	1
telling	1
him	1
that	1
she	1
pledged	1
herself,	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
it	1
should	1
appear	1
certain	1
that	1
his	1
master	1
had	1
decapitated	1
the	1
giant,	1
and	1
she	1
found	1
herself	1
peacefully	1
established	1
in	1
her	1
kingdom,	1
to	1
bestow	1
upon	1
him	1
the	1
best	1
county	1
there	1
was	1
in	1
it.	1
With	1
this	1
Sancho	1
consoled	1
himself,	1
and	1
assured	1
the	1
princess	1
she	1
might	1
rely	1
upon	1
it	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
seen	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
giant,	1
and	1
more	1
by	1
token	1
it	1
had	1
a	1
beard	1
that	1
reached	1
to	1
the	1
girdle,	1
and	1
that	1
if	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
seen	1
now	1
it	1
was	1
because	1
everything	1
that	1
happened	1
in	1
that	1
house	1
went	1
by	1
enchantment,	1
as	1
he	1
himself	1
had	1
proved	1
the	1
last	1
time	1
he	1
had	1
lodged	1
there.	1
Dorothea	1
said	1
she	1
fully	1
believed	1
it,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
need	1
not	1
be	1
uneasy,	1
for	1
all	1
would	1
go	1
well	1
and	1
turn	1
out	1
as	1
he	1
wished.	1
All	1
therefore	1
being	1
appeased,	1
the	1
curate	1
was	1
anxious	1
to	1
go	1
on	1
with	1
the	1
novel,	1
as	1
he	1
saw	1
there	1
was	1
but	1
little	1
more	1
left	1
to	1
read.	1
Dorothea	1
and	1
the	1
others	1
begged	1
him	1
to	1
finish	1
it,	1
and	1
he,	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
willing	1
to	1
please	1
them,	1
and	1
enjoyed	1
reading	1
it	1
himself,	1
continued	1
the	1
tale	1
in	1
these	1
words:	1
The	1
result	1
was,	1
that	1
from	1
the	1
confidence	1
Anselmo	1
felt	1
in	1
Camilla’s	1
virtue,	1
he	1
lived	1
happy	1
and	1
free	1
from	1
anxiety,	1
and	1
Camilla	1
purposely	1
looked	1
coldly	1
on	1
Lothario,	1
that	1
Anselmo	1
might	1
suppose	1
her	1
feelings	1
towards	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
opposite	1
of	1
what	1
they	1
were;	1
and	1
the	1
better	1
to	1
support	1
the	1
position,	1
Lothario	1
begged	1
to	1
be	1
excused	1
from	1
coming	1
to	1
the	1
house,	1
as	1
the	1
displeasure	1
with	1
which	1
Camilla	1
regarded	1
his	1
presence	1
was	1
plain	1
to	1
be	1
seen.	1
But	1
the	1
befooled	1
Anselmo	1
said	1
he	1
would	1
on	1
no	1
account	1
allow	1
such	1
a	1
thing,	1
and	1
so	1
in	1
a	1
thousand	1
ways	1
he	1
became	1
the	1
author	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
dishonour,	1
while	1
he	1
believed	1
he	1
was	1
insuring	1
his	1
happiness.	1
Meanwhile	1
the	1
satisfaction	1
with	1
which	1
Leonela	1
saw	1
herself	1
empowered	1
to	1
carry	1
on	1
her	1
amour	1
reached	1
such	1
a	1
height	1
that,	1
regardless	1
of	1
everything	1
else,	1
she	1
followed	1
her	1
inclinations	1
unrestrainedly,	1
feeling	1
confident	1
that	1
her	1
mistress	1
would	1
screen	1
her,	1
and	1
even	1
show	1
her	1
how	1
to	1
manage	1
it	1
safely.	1
At	1
last	1
one	1
night	1
Anselmo	1
heard	1
footsteps	1
in	1
Leonela’s	1
room,	1
and	1
on	1
trying	1
to	1
enter	1
to	1
see	1
who	1
it	1
was,	1
he	1
found	1
that	1
the	1
door	1
was	1
held	1
against	1
him,	1
which	1
made	1
him	1
all	1
the	1
more	1
determined	1
to	1
open	1
it;	1
and	1
exerting	1
his	1
strength	1
he	1
forced	1
it	1
open,	1
and	1
entered	1
the	1
room	1
in	1
time	1
to	1
see	1
a	1
man	1
leaping	1
through	1
the	1
window	1
into	1
the	1
street.	1
He	1
ran	1
quickly	1
to	1
seize	1
him	1
or	1
discover	1
who	1
he	1
was,	1
but	1
he	1
was	1
unable	1
to	1
effect	1
either	1
purpose,	1
for	1
Leonela	1
flung	1
her	1
arms	1
round	1
him	1
crying,	1
“Be	1
calm,	1
señor;	1
do	1
not	1
give	1
way	1
to	1
passion	1
or	1
follow	1
him	1
who	1
has	1
escaped	1
from	1
this;	1
he	1
belongs	1
to	1
me,	1
and	1
in	1
fact	1
he	1
is	1
my	1
husband.”	1
Anselmo	1
would	1
not	1
believe	1
it,	1
but	1
blind	1
with	1
rage	1
drew	1
a	1
dagger	1
and	1
threatened	1
to	1
stab	1
Leonela,	1
bidding	1
her	1
tell	1
the	1
truth	1
or	1
he	1
would	1
kill	1
her.	1
She,	1
in	1
her	1
fear,	1
not	1
knowing	1
what	1
she	1
was	1
saying,	1
exclaimed,	1
“Do	1
not	1
kill	1
me,	1
señor,	1
for	1
I	1
can	1
tell	1
you	1
things	1
more	1
important	1
than	1
any	1
you	1
can	1
imagine.”	1
“Tell	1
me	1
then	1
at	1
once	1
or	1
thou	1
diest,”	1
said	1
Anselmo.	1
“It	1
would	1
be	1
impossible	1
for	1
me	1
now,”	1
said	1
Leonela,	1
“I	1
am	1
so	1
agitated:	1
leave	1
me	1
till	1
to-morrow,	1
and	1
then	1
you	1
shall	1
hear	1
from	1
me	1
what	1
will	1
fill	1
you	1
with	1
astonishment;	1
but	1
rest	1
assured	1
that	1
he	1
who	1
leaped	1
through	1
the	1
window	1
is	1
a	1
young	1
man	1
of	1
this	1
city,	1
who	1
has	1
given	1
me	1
his	1
promise	1
to	1
become	1
my	1
husband.”	1
Anselmo	1
was	1
appeased	1
with	1
this,	1
and	1
was	1
content	1
to	1
wait	1
the	1
time	1
she	1
asked	1
of	1
him,	1
for	1
he	1
never	1
expected	1
to	1
hear	1
anything	1
against	1
Camilla,	1
so	1
satisfied	1
and	1
sure	1
of	1
her	1
virtue	1
was	1
he;	1
and	1
so	1
he	1
quitted	1
the	1
room,	1
and	1
left	1
Leonela	1
locked	1
in,	1
telling	1
her	1
she	1
should	1
not	1
come	1
out	1
until	1
she	1
had	1
told	1
him	1
all	1
she	1
had	1
to	1
make	1
known	1
to	1
him.	1
He	1
went	1
at	1
once	1
to	1
see	1
Camilla,	1
and	1
tell	1
her,	1
as	1
he	1
did,	1
all	1
that	1
had	1
passed	1
between	1
him	1
and	1
her	1
handmaid,	1
and	1
the	1
promise	1
she	1
had	1
given	1
him	1
to	1
inform	1
him	1
matters	1
of	1
serious	1
importance.	1
There	1
is	1
no	1
need	1
of	1
saying	1
whether	1
Camilla	1
was	1
agitated	1
or	1
not,	1
for	1
so	1
great	1
was	1
her	1
fear	1
and	1
dismay,	1
that,	1
making	1
sure,	1
as	1
she	1
had	1
good	1
reason	1
to	1
do,	1
that	1
Leonela	1
would	1
tell	1
Anselmo	1
all	1
she	1
knew	1
of	1
her	1
faithlessness,	1
she	1
had	1
not	1
the	1
courage	1
to	1
wait	1
and	1
see	1
if	1
her	1
suspicions	1
were	1
confirmed;	1
and	1
that	1
same	1
night,	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
she	1
thought	1
that	1
Anselmo	1
was	1
asleep,	1
she	1
packed	1
up	1
the	1
most	1
valuable	1
jewels	1
she	1
had	1
and	1
some	1
money,	1
and	1
without	1
being	1
observed	1
by	1
anybody	1
escaped	1
from	1
the	1
house	1
and	1
betook	1
herself	1
to	1
Lothario’s,	1
to	1
whom	1
she	1
related	1
what	1
had	1
occurred,	1
imploring	1
him	1
to	1
convey	1
her	1
to	1
some	1
place	1
of	1
safety	1
or	1
fly	1
with	1
her	1
where	1
they	1
might	1
be	1
safe	1
from	1
Anselmo.	1
The	1
state	1
of	1
perplexity	1
to	1
which	1
Camilla	1
reduced	1
Lothario	1
was	1
such	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
unable	1
to	1
utter	1
a	1
word	1
in	1
reply,	1
still	1
less	1
to	1
decide	1
upon	1
what	1
he	1
should	1
do.	1
At	1
length	1
he	1
resolved	1
to	1
conduct	1
her	1
to	1
a	1
convent	1
of	1
which	1
a	1
sister	1
of	1
his	1
was	1
prioress;	1
Camilla	1
agreed	1
to	1
this,	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
speed	1
which	1
the	1
circumstances	1
demanded,	1
Lothario	1
took	1
her	1
to	1
the	1
convent	1
and	1
left	1
her	1
there,	1
and	1
then	1
himself	1
quitted	1
the	1
city	1
without	1
letting	1
anyone	1
know	1
of	1
his	1
departure.	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
daylight	1
came	1
Anselmo,	1
without	1
missing	1
Camilla	1
from	1
his	1
side,	1
rose	1
eager	1
to	1
learn	1
what	1
Leonela	1
had	1
to	1
tell	1
him,	1
and	1
hastened	1
to	1
the	1
room	1
where	1
he	1
had	1
locked	1
her	1
in.	1
He	1
opened	1
the	1
door,	1
entered,	1
but	1
found	1
no	1
Leonela;	1
all	1
he	1
found	1
was	1
some	1
sheets	1
knotted	1
to	1
the	1
window,	1
a	1
plain	1
proof	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
let	1
herself	1
down	1
from	1
it	1
and	1
escaped.	1
He	1
returned,	1
uneasy,	1
to	1
tell	1
Camilla,	1
but	1
not	1
finding	1
her	1
in	1
bed	1
or	1
anywhere	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
he	1
was	1
lost	1
in	1
amazement.	1
He	1
asked	1
the	1
servants	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
about	1
her,	1
but	1
none	1
of	1
them	1
could	1
give	1
him	1
any	1
explanation.	1
As	1
he	1
was	1
going	1
in	1
search	1
of	1
Camilla	1
it	1
happened	1
by	1
chance	1
that	1
he	1
observed	1
her	1
boxes	1
were	1
lying	1
open,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
greater	1
part	1
of	1
her	1
jewels	1
were	1
gone;	1
and	1
now	1
he	1
became	1
fully	1
aware	1
of	1
his	1
disgrace,	1
and	1
that	1
Leonela	1
was	1
not	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
his	1
misfortune;	1
and,	1
just	1
as	1
he	1
was,	1
without	1
delaying	1
to	1
dress	1
himself	1
completely,	1
he	1
repaired,	1
sad	1
at	1
heart	1
and	1
dejected,	1
to	1
his	1
friend	1
Lothario	1
to	1
make	1
known	1
his	1
sorrow	1
to	1
him;	1
but	1
when	1
he	1
failed	1
to	1
find	1
him	1
and	1
the	1
servants	1
reported	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
absent	1
from	1
his	1
house	1
all	1
night	1
and	1
had	1
taken	1
with	1
him	1
all	1
the	1
money	1
he	1
had,	1
he	1
felt	1
as	1
though	1
he	1
were	1
losing	1
his	1
senses;	1
and	1
to	1
make	1
all	1
complete	1
on	1
returning	1
to	1
his	1
own	1
house	1
he	1
found	1
it	1
deserted	1
and	1
empty,	1
not	1
one	1
of	1
all	1
his	1
servants,	1
male	1
or	1
female,	1
remaining	1
in	1
it.	1
He	1
knew	1
not	1
what	1
to	1
think,	1
or	1
say,	1
or	1
do,	1
and	1
his	1
reason	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
deserting	1
him	1
little	1
by	1
little.	1
He	1
reviewed	1
his	1
position,	1
and	1
saw	1
himself	1
in	1
a	1
moment	1
left	1
without	1
wife,	1
friend,	1
or	1
servants,	1
abandoned,	1
he	1
felt,	1
by	1
the	1
heaven	1
above	1
him,	1
and	1
more	1
than	1
all	1
robbed	1
of	1
his	1
honour,	1
for	1
in	1
Camilla’s	1
disappearance	1
he	1
saw	1
his	1
own	1
ruin.	1
After	1
long	1
reflection	1
he	1
resolved	1
at	1
last	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
his	1
friend’s	1
village,	1
where	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
staying	1
when	1
he	1
afforded	1
opportunities	1
for	1
the	1
contrivance	1
of	1
this	1
complication	1
of	1
misfortune.	1
He	1
locked	1
the	1
doors	1
of	1
his	1
house,	1
mounted	1
his	1
horse,	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
broken	1
spirit	1
set	1
out	1
on	1
his	1
journey;	1
but	1
he	1
had	1
hardly	1
gone	1
half-way	1
when,	1
harassed	1
by	1
his	1
reflections,	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
dismount	1
and	1
tie	1
his	1
horse	1
to	1
a	1
tree,	1
at	1
the	1
foot	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
threw	1
himself,	1
giving	1
vent	1
to	1
piteous	1
heartrending	1
sighs;	1
and	1
there	1
he	1
remained	1
till	1
nearly	1
nightfall,	1
when	1
he	1
observed	1
a	1
man	1
approaching	1
on	1
horseback	1
from	1
the	1
city,	1
of	1
whom,	1
after	1
saluting	1
him,	1
he	1
asked	1
what	1
was	1
the	1
news	1
in	1
Florence.	1
The	1
citizen	1
replied,	1
“The	1
strangest	1
that	1
have	1
been	1
heard	1
for	1
many	1
a	1
day;	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
reported	1
abroad	1
that	1
Lothario,	1
the	1
great	1
friend	1
of	1
the	1
wealthy	1
Anselmo,	1
who	1
lived	1
at	1
San	1
Giovanni,	1
carried	1
off	1
last	1
night	1
Camilla,	1
the	1
wife	1
of	1
Anselmo,	1
who	1
also	1
has	1
disappeared.	1
All	1
this	1
has	1
been	1
told	1
by	1
a	1
maid-servant	1
of	1
Camilla’s,	1
whom	1
the	1
governor	1
found	1
last	1
night	1
lowering	1
herself	1
by	1
a	1
sheet	1
from	1
the	1
windows	1
of	1
Anselmo’s	1
house.	1
I	1
know	1
not	1
indeed,	1
precisely,	1
how	1
the	1
affair	1
came	1
to	1
pass;	1
all	1
I	1
know	1
is	1
that	1
the	1
whole	1
city	1
is	1
wondering	1
at	1
the	1
occurrence,	1
for	1
no	1
one	1
could	1
have	1
expected	1
a	1
thing	1
of	1
the	1
kind,	1
seeing	1
the	1
great	1
and	1
intimate	1
friendship	1
that	1
existed	1
between	1
them,	1
so	1
great,	1
they	1
say,	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
called	1
‘The	1
Two	1
Friends.’”	1
“Is	1
it	1
known	1
at	1
all,”	1
said	1
Anselmo,	1
“what	1
road	1
Lothario	1
and	1
Camilla	1
took?”	1
“Not	1
in	1
the	1
least,”	1
said	1
the	1
citizen,	1
“though	1
the	1
governor	1
has	1
been	1
very	1
active	1
in	1
searching	1
for	1
them.”	1
“God	1
speed	1
you,	1
señor,”	1
said	1
Anselmo.	1
“God	1
be	1
with	1
you,”	1
said	1
the	1
citizen	1
and	1
went	1
his	1
way.	1
This	1
disastrous	1
intelligence	1
almost	1
robbed	1
Anselmo	1
not	1
only	1
of	1
his	1
senses	1
but	1
of	1
his	1
life.	1
He	1
got	1
up	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
able	1
and	1
reached	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
his	1
friend,	1
who	1
as	1
yet	1
knew	1
nothing	1
of	1
his	1
misfortune,	1
but	1
seeing	1
him	1
come	1
pale,	1
worn,	1
and	1
haggard,	1
perceived	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
suffering	1
some	1
heavy	1
affliction.	1
Anselmo	1
at	1
once	1
begged	1
to	1
be	1
allowed	1
to	1
retire	1
to	1
rest,	1
and	1
to	1
be	1
given	1
writing	1
materials.	1
His	1
wish	1
was	1
complied	1
with	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
left	1
lying	1
down	1
and	1
alone,	1
for	1
he	1
desired	1
this,	1
and	1
even	1
that	1
the	1
door	1
should	1
be	1
locked.	1
Finding	1
himself	1
alone	1
he	1
so	1
took	1
to	1
heart	1
the	1
thought	1
of	1
his	1
misfortune	1
that	1
by	1
the	1
signs	1
of	1
death	1
he	1
felt	1
within	1
him	1
he	1
knew	1
well	1
his	1
life	1
was	1
drawing	1
to	1
a	1
close,	1
and	1
therefore	1
he	1
resolved	1
to	1
leave	1
behind	1
him	1
a	1
declaration	1
of	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
his	1
strange	1
end.	1
He	1
began	1
to	1
write,	1
but	1
before	1
he	1
had	1
put	1
down	1
all	1
he	1
meant	1
to	1
say,	1
his	1
breath	1
failed	1
him	1
and	1
he	1
yielded	1
up	1
his	1
life,	1
a	1
victim	1
to	1
the	1
suffering	1
which	1
his	1
ill-advised	1
curiosity	1
had	1
entailed	1
upon	1
him.	1
The	1
master	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
observing	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
now	1
late	1
and	1
that	1
Anselmo	1
did	1
not	1
call,	1
determined	1
to	1
go	1
in	1
and	1
ascertain	1
if	1
his	1
indisposition	1
was	1
increasing,	1
and	1
found	1
him	1
lying	1
on	1
his	1
face,	1
his	1
body	1
partly	1
in	1
the	1
bed,	1
partly	1
on	1
the	1
writing-table,	1
on	1
which	1
he	1
lay	1
with	1
the	1
written	1
paper	1
open	1
and	1
the	1
pen	1
still	1
in	1
his	1
hand.	1
Having	1
first	1
called	1
to	1
him	1
without	1
receiving	1
any	1
answer,	1
his	1
host	1
approached	1
him,	1
and	1
taking	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
hand,	1
found	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
cold,	1
and	1
saw	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
dead.	1
Greatly	1
surprised	1
and	1
distressed	1
he	1
summoned	1
the	1
household	1
to	1
witness	1
the	1
sad	1
fate	1
which	1
had	1
befallen	1
Anselmo;	1
and	1
then	1
he	1
read	1
the	1
paper,	1
the	1
handwriting	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
recognised	1
as	1
his,	1
and	1
which	1
contained	1
these	1
words:	1
“A	1
foolish	1
and	1
ill-advised	1
desire	1
has	1
robbed	1
me	1
of	1
life.	1
If	1
the	1
news	1
of	1
my	1
death	1
should	1
reach	1
the	1
ears	1
of	1
Camilla,	1
let	1
her	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
forgive	1
her,	1
for	1
she	1
was	1
not	1
bound	1
to	1
perform	1
miracles,	1
nor	1
ought	1
I	1
to	1
have	1
required	1
her	1
to	1
perform	1
them;	1
and	1
since	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
the	1
author	1
of	1
my	1
own	1
dishonour,	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
reason	1
why—”	1
So	1
far	1
Anselmo	1
had	1
written,	1
and	1
thus	1
it	1
was	1
plain	1
that	1
at	1
this	1
point,	1
before	1
he	1
could	1
finish	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
say,	1
his	1
life	1
came	1
to	1
an	1
end.	1
The	1
next	1
day	1
his	1
friend	1
sent	1
intelligence	1
of	1
his	1
death	1
to	1
his	1
relatives,	1
who	1
had	1
already	1
ascertained	1
his	1
misfortune,	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
the	1
convent	1
where	1
Camilla	1
lay	1
almost	1
on	1
the	1
point	1
of	1
accompanying	1
her	1
husband	1
on	1
that	1
inevitable	1
journey,	1
not	1
on	1
account	1
of	1
the	1
tidings	1
of	1
his	1
death,	1
but	1
because	1
of	1
those	1
she	1
received	1
of	1
her	1
lover’s	1
departure.	1
Although	1
she	1
saw	1
herself	1
a	1
widow,	1
it	1
is	1
said	1
she	1
refused	1
either	1
to	1
quit	1
the	1
convent	1
or	1
take	1
the	1
veil,	1
until,	1
not	1
long	1
afterwards,	1
intelligence	1
reached	1
her	1
that	1
Lothario	1
had	1
been	1
killed	1
in	1
a	1
battle	1
in	1
which	1
M.	1
de	1
Lautrec	1
had	1
been	1
recently	1
engaged	1
with	1
the	1
Great	1
Captain	1
Gonzalo	1
Fernandez	1
de	1
Cordova	1
in	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
Naples,	1
whither	1
her	1
too	1
late	1
repentant	1
lover	1
had	1
repaired.	1
On	1
learning	1
this	1
Camilla	1
took	1
the	1
veil,	1
and	1
shortly	1
afterwards	1
died,	1
worn	1
out	1
by	1
grief	1
and	1
melancholy.	1
This	1
was	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
all	1
three,	1
an	1
end	1
that	1
came	1
of	1
a	1
thoughtless	1
beginning.	1
“I	1
like	1
this	1
novel,”	1
said	1
the	1
curate;	1
“but	1
I	1
cannot	1
persuade	1
myself	1
of	1
its	1
truth;	1
and	1
if	1
it	1
has	1
been	1
invented,	1
the	1
author’s	1
invention	1
is	1
faulty,	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
impossible	1
to	1
imagine	1
any	1
husband	1
so	1
foolish	1
as	1
to	1
try	1
such	1
a	1
costly	1
experiment	1
as	1
Anselmo’s.	1
If	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
represented	1
as	1
occurring	1
between	1
a	1
gallant	1
and	1
his	1
mistress	1
it	1
might	1
pass;	1
but	1
between	1
husband	1
and	1
wife	1
there	1
is	1
something	1
of	1
an	1
impossibility	1
about	1
it.	1
As	1
to	1
the	1
way	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
story	1
is	1
told,	1
however,	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
fault	1
to	1
find.”	1

OCCURRED	1
AT	1
THE	1
INN	1

Full	1
Size	1
Just	1
at	1
that	1
instant	1
the	1
landlord,	1
who	1
was	1
standing	1
at	1
the	1
gate	1
of	1
the	1
inn,	1
exclaimed,	1
“Here	1
comes	1
a	1
fine	1
troop	1
of	1
guests;	1
if	1
they	1
stop	1
here	1
we	1
may	1
say	1
_gaudeamus_.”	1
“What	1
are	1
they?”	1
said	1
Cardenio.	1
“Four	1
men,”	1
said	1
the	1
landlord,	1
“riding	1
_à	1
la	1
jineta_,	1
with	1
lances	1
and	1
bucklers,	1
and	1
all	1
with	1
black	1
veils,	1
and	1
with	1
them	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
woman	1
in	1
white	1
on	1
a	1
side-saddle,	1
whose	1
face	1
is	1
also	1
veiled,	1
and	1
two	1
attendants	1
on	1
foot.”	1
“Are	1
they	1
very	1
near?”	1
said	1
the	1
curate.	1
“So	1
near,”	1
answered	1
the	1
landlord,	1
“that	1
here	1
they	1
come.”	1
Hearing	1
this	1
Dorothea	1
covered	1
her	1
face,	1
and	1
Cardenio	1
retreated	1
into	1
Don	1
Quixote’s	1
room,	1
and	1
they	1
hardly	1
had	1
time	1
to	1
do	1
so	1
before	1
the	1
whole	1
party	1
the	1
host	1
had	1
described	1
entered	1
the	1
inn,	1
and	1
the	1
four	1
that	1
were	1
on	1
horseback,	1
who	1
were	1
of	1
highbred	1
appearance	1
and	1
bearing,	1
dismounted,	1
and	1
came	1
forward	1
to	1
take	1
down	1
the	1
woman	1
who	1
rode	1
on	1
the	1
side-saddle,	1
and	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
taking	1
her	1
in	1
his	1
arms	1
placed	1
her	1
in	1
a	1
chair	1
that	1
stood	1
at	1
the	1
entrance	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
where	1
Cardenio	1
had	1
hidden	1
himself.	1
All	1
this	1
time	1
neither	1
she	1
nor	1
they	1
had	1
removed	1
their	1
veils	1
or	1
spoken	1
a	1
word,	1
only	1
on	1
sitting	1
down	1
on	1
the	1
chair	1
the	1
woman	1
gave	1
a	1
deep	1
sigh	1
and	1
let	1
her	1
arms	1
fall	1
like	1
one	1
that	1
was	1
ill	1
and	1
weak.	1
The	1
attendants	1
on	1
foot	1
then	1
led	1
the	1
horses	1
away	1
to	1
the	1
stable.	1
Observing	1
this	1
the	1
curate,	1
curious	1
to	1
know	1
who	1
these	1
people	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
dress	1
and	1
preserving	1
such	1
silence	1
were,	1
went	1
to	1
where	1
the	1
servants	1
were	1
standing	1
and	1
put	1
the	1
question	1
to	1
one	1
of	1
them,	1
who	1
answered	1
him.	1
“Faith,	1
sir,	1
I	1
cannot	1
tell	1
you	1
who	1
they	1
are,	1
I	1
only	1
know	1
they	1
seem	1
to	1
be	1
people	1
of	1
distinction,	1
particularly	1
he	1
who	1
advanced	1
to	1
take	1
the	1
lady	1
you	1
saw	1
in	1
his	1
arms;	1
and	1
I	1
say	1
so	1
because	1
all	1
the	1
rest	1
show	1
him	1
respect,	1
and	1
nothing	1
is	1
done	1
except	1
what	1
he	1
directs	1
and	1
orders.”	1
“And	1
the	1
lady,	1
who	1
is	1
she?”	1
asked	1
the	1
curate.	1
“That	1
I	1
cannot	1
tell	1
you	1
either,”	1
said	1
the	1
servant,	1
“for	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
seen	1
her	1
face	1
all	1
the	1
way:	1
I	1
have	1
indeed	1
heard	1
her	1
sigh	1
many	1
times	1
and	1
utter	1
such	1
groans	1
that	1
she	1
seems	1
to	1
be	1
giving	1
up	1
the	1
ghost	1
every	1
time;	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
no	1
wonder	1
if	1
we	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
more	1
than	1
we	1
have	1
told	1
you,	1
as	1
my	1
comrade	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
only	1
been	1
in	1
their	1
company	1
two	1
days,	1
for	1
having	1
met	1
us	1
on	1
the	1
road	1
they	1
begged	1
and	1
persuaded	1
us	1
to	1
accompany	1
them	1
to	1
Andalusia,	1
promising	1
to	1
pay	1
us	1
well.”	1
“And	1
have	1
you	1
heard	1
any	1
of	1
them	1
called	1
by	1
his	1
name?”	1
asked	1
the	1
curate.	1
“No,	1
indeed,”	1
replied	1
the	1
servant;	1
“they	1
all	1
preserve	1
a	1
marvellous	1
silence	1
on	1
the	1
road,	1
for	1
not	1
a	1
sound	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
heard	1
among	1
them	1
except	1
the	1
poor	1
lady’s	1
sighs	1
and	1
sobs,	1
which	1
make	1
us	1
pity	1
her;	1
and	1
we	1
feel	1
sure	1
that	1
wherever	1
it	1
is	1
she	1
is	1
going,	1
it	1
is	1
against	1
her	1
will,	1
and	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
one	1
can	1
judge	1
from	1
her	1
dress	1
she	1
is	1
a	1
nun	1
or,	1
what	1
is	1
more	1
likely,	1
about	1
to	1
become	1
one;	1
and	1
perhaps	1
it	1
is	1
because	1
taking	1
the	1
vows	1
is	1
not	1
of	1
her	1
own	1
free	1
will,	1
that	1
she	1
is	1
so	1
unhappy	1
as	1
she	1
seems	1
to	1
be.”	1
“That	1
may	1
well	1
be,”	1
said	1
the	1
curate,	1
and	1
leaving	1
them	1
he	1
returned	1
to	1
where	1
Dorothea	1
was,	1
who,	1
hearing	1
the	1
veiled	1
lady	1
sigh,	1
moved	1
by	1
natural	1
compassion	1
drew	1
near	1
to	1
her	1
and	1
said,	1
“What	1
are	1
you	1
suffering	1
from,	1
señora?	1
If	1
it	1
be	1
anything	1
that	1
women	1
are	1
accustomed	1
and	1
know	1
how	1
to	1
relieve,	1
I	1
offer	1
you	1
my	1
services	1
with	1
all	1
my	1
heart.”	1
To	1
this	1
the	1
unhappy	1
lady	1
made	1
no	1
reply;	1
and	1
though	1
Dorothea	1
repeated	1
her	1
offers	1
more	1
earnestly	1
she	1
still	1
kept	1
silence,	1
until	1
the	1
gentleman	1
with	1
the	1
veil,	1
who,	1
the	1
servant	1
said,	1
was	1
obeyed	1
by	1
the	1
rest,	1
approached	1
and	1
said	1
to	1
Dorothea,	1
“Do	1
not	1
give	1
yourself	1
the	1
trouble,	1
señora,	1
of	1
making	1
any	1
offers	1
to	1
that	1
woman,	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
her	1
way	1
to	1
give	1
no	1
thanks	1
for	1
anything	1
that	1
is	1
done	1
for	1
her;	1
and	1
do	1
not	1
try	1
to	1
make	1
her	1
answer	1
unless	1
you	1
want	1
to	1
hear	1
some	1
lie	1
from	1
her	1
lips.”	1
“I	1
have	1
never	1
told	1
a	1
lie,”	1
was	1
the	1
immediate	1
reply	1
of	1
her	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
silent	1
until	1
now;	1
“on	1
the	1
contrary,	1
it	1
is	1
because	1
I	1
am	1
so	1
truthful	1
and	1
so	1
ignorant	1
of	1
lying	1
devices	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
now	1
in	1
this	1
miserable	1
condition;	1
and	1
this	1
I	1
call	1
you	1
yourself	1
to	1
witness,	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
my	1
unstained	1
truth	1
that	1
has	1
made	1
you	1
false	1
and	1
a	1
liar.”	1
Cardenio	1
heard	1
these	1
words	1
clearly	1
and	1
distinctly,	1
being	1
quite	1
close	1
to	1
the	1
speaker,	1
for	1
there	1
was	1
only	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
Don	1
Quixote’s	1
room	1
between	1
them,	1
and	1
the	1
instant	1
he	1
did	1
so,	1
uttering	1
a	1
loud	1
exclamation	1
he	1
cried,	1
“Good	1
God!	1
what	1
is	1
this	1
I	1
hear?	1
What	1
voice	1
is	1
this	1
that	1
has	1
reached	1
my	1
ears?”	1
Startled	1
at	1
the	1
voice	1
the	1
lady	1
turned	1
her	1
head;	1
and	1
not	1
seeing	1
the	1
speaker	1
she	1
stood	1
up	1
and	1
attempted	1
to	1
enter	1
the	1
room;	1
observing	1
which	1
the	1
gentleman	1
held	1
her	1
back,	1
preventing	1
her	1
from	1
moving	1
a	1
step.	1
In	1
her	1
agitation	1
and	1
sudden	1
movement	1
the	1
silk	1
with	1
which	1
she	1
had	1
covered	1
her	1
face	1
fell	1
off	1
and	1
disclosed	1
a	1
countenance	1
of	1
incomparable	1
and	1
marvellous	1
beauty,	1
but	1
pale	1
and	1
terrified;	1
for	1
she	1
kept	1
turning	1
her	1
eyes,	1
everywhere	1
she	1
could	1
direct	1
her	1
gaze,	1
with	1
an	1
eagerness	1
that	1
made	1
her	1
look	1
as	1
if	1
she	1
had	1
lost	1
her	1
senses,	1
and	1
so	1
marked	1
that	1
it	1
excited	1
the	1
pity	1
of	1
Dorothea	1
and	1
all	1
who	1
beheld	1
her,	1
though	1
they	1
knew	1
not	1
what	1
caused	1
it.	1
The	1
gentleman	1
grasped	1
her	1
firmly	1
by	1
the	1
shoulders,	1
and	1
being	1
so	1
fully	1
occupied	1
with	1
holding	1
her	1
back,	1
he	1
was	1
unable	1
to	1
put	1
a	1
hand	1
to	1
his	1
veil	1
which	1
was	1
falling	1
off,	1
as	1
it	1
did	1
at	1
length	1
entirely,	1
and	1
Dorothea,	1
who	1
was	1
holding	1
the	1
lady	1
in	1
her	1
arms,	1
raising	1
her	1
eyes	1
saw	1
that	1
he	1
who	1
likewise	1
held	1
her	1
was	1
her	1
husband,	1
Don	1
Fernando.	1
The	1
instant	1
she	1
recognised	1
him,	1
with	1
a	1
prolonged	1
plaintive	1
cry	1
drawn	1
from	1
the	1
depths	1
of	1
her	1
heart,	1
she	1
fell	1
backwards	1
fainting,	1
and	1
but	1
for	1
the	1
barber	1
being	1
close	1
by	1
to	1
catch	1
her	1
in	1
his	1
arms,	1
she	1
would	1
have	1
fallen	1
completely	1
to	1
the	1
ground.	1
The	1
curate	1
at	1
once	1
hastened	1
to	1
uncover	1
her	1
face	1
and	1
throw	1
water	1
on	1
it,	1
and	1
as	1
he	1
did	1
so	1
Don	1
Fernando,	1
for	1
he	1
it	1
was	1
who	1
held	1
the	1
other	1
in	1
his	1
arms,	1
recognised	1
her	1
and	1
stood	1
as	1
if	1
death-stricken	1
by	1
the	1
sight;	1
not,	1
however,	1
relaxing	1
his	1
grasp	1
of	1
Luscinda,	1
for	1
it	1
was	1
she	1
that	1
was	1
struggling	1
to	1
release	1
herself	1
from	1
his	1
hold,	1
having	1
recognised	1
Cardenio	1
by	1
his	1
voice,	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
recognised	1
her.	1
Cardenio	1
also	1
heard	1
Dorothea’s	1
cry	1
as	1
she	1
fell	1
fainting,	1
and	1
imagining	1
that	1
it	1
came	1
from	1
his	1
Luscinda	1
burst	1
forth	1
in	1
terror	1
from	1
the	1
room,	1
and	1
the	1
first	1
thing	1
he	1
saw	1
was	1
Don	1
Fernando	1
with	1
Luscinda	1
in	1
his	1
arms.	1
Don	1
Fernando,	1
too,	1
knew	1
Cardenio	1
at	1
once;	1
and	1
all	1
three,	1
Luscinda,	1
Cardenio,	1
and	1
Dorothea,	1
stood	1
in	1
silent	1
amazement	1
scarcely	1
knowing	1
what	1
had	1
happened	1
to	1
them.	1
They	1
gazed	1
at	1
one	1
another	1
without	1
speaking,	1
Dorothea	1
at	1
Don	1
Fernando,	1
Don	1
Fernando	1
at	1
Cardenio,	1
Cardenio	1
at	1
Luscinda,	1
and	1
Luscinda	1
at	1
Cardenio.	1
The	1
first	1
to	1
break	1
silence	1
was	1
Luscinda,	1
who	1
thus	1
addressed	1
Don	1
Fernando:	1
“Leave	1
me,	1
Señor	1
Don	1
Fernando,	1
for	1
the	1
sake	1
of	1
what	1
you	1
owe	1
to	1
yourself;	1
if	1
no	1
other	1
reason	1
will	1
induce	1
you,	1
leave	1
me	1
to	1
cling	1
to	1
the	1
wall	1
of	1
which	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
ivy,	1
to	1
the	1
support	1
from	1
which	1
neither	1
your	1
importunities,	1
nor	1
your	1
threats,	1
nor	1
your	1
promises,	1
nor	1
your	1
gifts	1
have	1
been	1
able	1
to	1
detach	1
me.	1
See	1
how	1
Heaven,	1
by	1
ways	1
strange	1
and	1
hidden	1
from	1
our	1
sight,	1
has	1
brought	1
me	1
face	1
to	1
face	1
with	1
my	1
true	1
husband;	1
and	1
well	1
you	1
know	1
by	1
dear-bought	1
experience	1
that	1
death	1
alone	1
will	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
efface	1
him	1
from	1
my	1
memory.	1
May	1
this	1
plain	1
declaration,	1
then,	1
lead	1
you,	1
as	1
you	1
can	1
do	1
nothing	1
else,	1
to	1
turn	1
your	1
love	1
into	1
rage,	1
your	1
affection	1
into	1
resentment,	1
and	1
so	1
to	1
take	1
my	1
life;	1
for	1
if	1
I	1
yield	1
it	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
my	1
beloved	1
husband	1
I	1
count	1
it	1
well	1
bestowed;	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
by	1
my	1
death	1
he	1
will	1
be	1
convinced	1
that	1
I	1
kept	1
my	1
faith	1
to	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
last	1
moment	1
of	1
life.”	1
Meanwhile	1
Dorothea	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
herself,	1
and	1
had	1
heard	1
Luscinda’s	1
words,	1
by	1
means	1
of	1
which	1
she	1
divined	1
who	1
she	1
was;	1
but	1
seeing	1
that	1
Don	1
Fernando	1
did	1
not	1
yet	1
release	1
her	1
or	1
reply	1
to	1
her,	1
summoning	1
up	1
her	1
resolution	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
she	1
could	1
she	1
rose	1
and	1
knelt	1
at	1
his	1
feet,	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
flood	1
of	1
bright	1
and	1
touching	1
tears	1
addressed	1
him	1
thus:	1
“If,	1
my	1
lord,	1
the	1
beams	1
of	1
that	1
sun	1
that	1
thou	1
holdest	1
eclipsed	1
in	1
thine	1
arms	1
did	1
not	1
dazzle	1
and	1
rob	1
thine	1
eyes	1
of	1
sight	1
thou	1
wouldst	1
have	1
seen	1
by	1
this	1
time	1
that	1
she	1
who	1
kneels	1
at	1
thy	1
feet	1
is,	1
so	1
long	1
as	1
thou	1
wilt	1
have	1
it	1
so,	1
the	1
unhappy	1
and	1
unfortunate	1
Dorothea.	1
I	1
am	1
that	1
lowly	1
peasant	1
girl	1
whom	1
thou	1
in	1
thy	1
goodness	1
or	1
for	1
thy	1
pleasure	1
wouldst	1
raise	1
high	1
enough	1
to	1
call	1
herself	1
thine;	1
I	1
am	1
she	1
who	1
in	1
the	1
seclusion	1
of	1
innocence	1
led	1
a	1
contented	1
life	1
until	1
at	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
thy	1
importunity,	1
and	1
thy	1
true	1
and	1
tender	1
passion,	1
as	1
it	1
seemed,	1
she	1
opened	1
the	1
gates	1
of	1
her	1
modesty	1
and	1
surrendered	1
to	1
thee	1
the	1
keys	1
of	1
her	1
liberty;	1
a	1
gift	1
received	1
by	1
thee	1
but	1
thanklessly,	1
as	1
is	1
clearly	1
shown	1
by	1
my	1
forced	1
retreat	1
to	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
thou	1
dost	1
find	1
me,	1
and	1
by	1
thy	1
appearance	1
under	1
the	1
circumstances	1
in	1
which	1
I	1
see	1
thee.	1
Nevertheless,	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
thee	1
suppose	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
come	1
here	1
driven	1
by	1
my	1
shame;	1
it	1
is	1
only	1
grief	1
and	1
sorrow	1
at	1
seeing	1
myself	1
forgotten	1
by	1
thee	1
that	1
have	1
led	1
me.	1
It	1
was	1
thy	1
will	1
to	1
make	1
me	1
thine,	1
and	1
thou	1
didst	1
so	1
follow	1
thy	1
will,	1
that	1
now,	1
even	1
though	1
thou	1
repentest,	1
thou	1
canst	1
not	1
help	1
being	1
mine.	1
Bethink	1
thee,	1
my	1
lord,	1
the	1
unsurpassable	1
affection	1
I	1
bear	1
thee	1
may	1
compensate	1
for	1
the	1
beauty	1
and	1
noble	1
birth	1
for	1
which	1
thou	1
wouldst	1
desert	1
me.	1
Thou	1
canst	1
not	1
be	1
the	1
fair	1
Luscinda’s	1
because	1
thou	1
art	1
mine,	1
nor	1
can	1
she	1
be	1
thine	1
because	1
she	1
is	1
Cardenio’s;	1
and	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
easier,	1
remember,	1
to	1
bend	1
thy	1
will	1
to	1
love	1
one	1
who	1
adores	1
thee,	1
than	1
to	1
lead	1
one	1
to	1
love	1
thee	1
who	1
abhors	1
thee	1
now.	1
Thou	1
didst	1
address	1
thyself	1
to	1
my	1
simplicity,	1
thou	1
didst	1
lay	1
siege	1
to	1
my	1
virtue,	1
thou	1
wert	1
not	1
ignorant	1
of	1
my	1
station,	1
well	1
dost	1
thou	1
know	1
how	1
I	1
yielded	1
wholly	1
to	1
thy	1
will;	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
ground	1
or	1
reason	1
for	1
thee	1
to	1
plead	1
deception,	1
and	1
if	1
it	1
be	1
so,	1
as	1
it	1
is,	1
and	1
if	1
thou	1
art	1
a	1
Christian	1
as	1
thou	1
art	1
a	1
gentleman,	1
why	1
dost	1
thou	1
by	1
such	1
subterfuges	1
put	1
off	1
making	1
me	1
as	1
happy	1
at	1
last	1
as	1
thou	1
didst	1
at	1
first?	1
And	1
if	1
thou	1
wilt	1
not	1
have	1
me	1
for	1
what	1
I	1
am,	1
thy	1
true	1
and	1
lawful	1
wife,	1
at	1
least	1
take	1
and	1
accept	1
me	1
as	1
thy	1
slave,	1
for	1
so	1
long	1
as	1
I	1
am	1
thine	1
I	1
will	1
count	1
myself	1
happy	1
and	1
fortunate.	1
Do	1
not	1
by	1
deserting	1
me	1
let	1
my	1
shame	1
become	1
the	1
talk	1
of	1
the	1
gossips	1
in	1
the	1
streets;	1
make	1
not	1
the	1
old	1
age	1
of	1
my	1
parents	1
miserable;	1
for	1
the	1
loyal	1
services	1
they	1
as	1
faithful	1
vassals	1
have	1
ever	1
rendered	1
thine	1
are	1
not	1
deserving	1
of	1
such	1
a	1
return;	1
and	1
if	1
thou	1
thinkest	1
it	1
will	1
debase	1
thy	1
blood	1
to	1
mingle	1
it	1
with	1
mine,	1
reflect	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
little	1
or	1
no	1
nobility	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
that	1
has	1
not	1
travelled	1
the	1
same	1
road,	1
and	1
that	1
in	1
illustrious	1
lineages	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
the	1
woman’s	1
blood	1
that	1
is	1
of	1
account;	1
and,	1
moreover,	1
that	1
true	1
nobility	1
consists	1
in	1
virtue,	1
and	1
if	1
thou	1
art	1
wanting	1
in	1
that,	1
refusing	1
me	1
what	1
in	1
justice	1
thou	1
owest	1
me,	1
then	1
even	1
I	1
have	1
higher	1
claims	1
to	1
nobility	1
than	1
thine.	1
To	1
make	1
an	1
end,	1
señor,	1
these	1
are	1
my	1
last	1
words	1
to	1
thee:	1
whether	1
thou	1
wilt,	1
or	1
wilt	1
not,	1
I	1
am	1
thy	1
wife;	1
witness	1
thy	1
words,	1
which	1
must	1
not	1
and	1
ought	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
false,	1
if	1
thou	1
dost	1
pride	1
thyself	1
on	1
that	1
for	1
want	1
of	1
which	1
thou	1
scornest	1
me;	1
witness	1
the	1
pledge	1
which	1
thou	1
didst	1
give	1
me,	1
and	1
witness	1
Heaven,	1
which	1
thou	1
thyself	1
didst	1
call	1
to	1
witness	1
the	1
promise	1
thou	1
hadst	1
made	1
me;	1
and	1
if	1
all	1
this	1
fail,	1
thy	1
own	1
conscience	1
will	1
not	1
fail	1
to	1
lift	1
up	1
its	1
silent	1
voice	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
all	1
thy	1
gaiety,	1
and	1
vindicate	1
the	1
truth	1
of	1
what	1
I	1
say	1
and	1
mar	1
thy	1
highest	1
pleasure	1
and	1
enjoyment.”	1
All	1
this	1
and	1
more	1
the	1
injured	1
Dorothea	1
delivered	1
with	1
such	1
earnest	1
feeling	1
and	1
such	1
tears	1
that	1
all	1
present,	1
even	1
those	1
who	1
came	1
with	1
Don	1
Fernando,	1
were	1
constrained	1
to	1
join	1
her	1
in	1
them.	1
Don	1
Fernando	1
listened	1
to	1
her	1
without	1
replying,	1
until,	1
ceasing	1
to	1
speak,	1
she	1
gave	1
way	1
to	1
such	1
sobs	1
and	1
sighs	1
that	1
it	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
a	1
heart	1
of	1
brass	1
that	1
was	1
not	1
softened	1
by	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
so	1
great	1
sorrow.	1
Luscinda	1
stood	1
regarding	1
her	1
with	1
no	1
less	1
compassion	1
for	1
her	1
sufferings	1
than	1
admiration	1
for	1
her	1
intelligence	1
and	1
beauty,	1
and	1
would	1
have	1
gone	1
to	1
her	1
to	1
say	1
some	1
words	1
of	1
comfort	1
to	1
her,	1
but	1
was	1
prevented	1
by	1
Don	1
Fernando’s	1
grasp	1
which	1
held	1
her	1
fast.	1
He,	1
overwhelmed	1
with	1
confusion	1
and	1
astonishment,	1
after	1
regarding	1
Dorothea	1
for	1
some	1
moments	1
with	1
a	1
fixed	1
gaze,	1
opened	1
his	1
arms,	1
and,	1
releasing	1
Luscinda,	1
exclaimed:	1
“Thou	1
hast	1
conquered,	1
fair	1
Dorothea,	1
thou	1
hast	1
conquered,	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
impossible	1
to	1
have	1
the	1
heart	1
to	1
deny	1
the	1
united	1
force	1
of	1
so	1
many	1
truths.”	1
Luscinda	1
in	1
her	1
feebleness	1
was	1
on	1
the	1
point	1
of	1
falling	1
to	1
the	1
ground	1
when	1
Don	1
Fernando	1
released	1
her,	1
but	1
Cardenio,	1
who	1
stood	1
near,	1
having	1
retreated	1
behind	1
Don	1
Fernando	1
to	1
escape	1
recognition,	1
casting	1
fear	1
aside	1
and	1
regardless	1
of	1
what	1
might	1
happen,	1
ran	1
forward	1
to	1
support	1
her,	1
and	1
said	1
as	1
he	1
clasped	1
her	1
in	1
his	1
arms,	1
“If	1
Heaven	1
in	1
its	1
compassion	1
is	1
willing	1
to	1
let	1
thee	1
rest	1
at	1
last,	1
mistress	1
of	1
my	1
heart,	1
true,	1
constant,	1
and	1
fair,	1
nowhere	1
canst	1
thou	1
rest	1
more	1
safely	1
than	1
in	1
these	1
arms	1
that	1
now	1
receive	1
thee,	1
and	1
received	1
thee	1
before	1
when	1
fortune	1
permitted	1
me	1
to	1
call	1
thee	1
mine.”	1
At	1
these	1
words	1
Luscinda	1
looked	1
up	1
at	1
Cardenio,	1
at	1
first	1
beginning	1
to	1
recognise	1
him	1
by	1
his	1
voice	1
and	1
then	1
satisfying	1
herself	1
by	1
her	1
eyes	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
he,	1
and	1
hardly	1
knowing	1
what	1
she	1
did,	1
and	1
heedless	1
of	1
all	1
considerations	1
of	1
decorum,	1
she	1
flung	1
her	1
arms	1
around	1
his	1
neck	1
and	1
pressing	1
her	1
face	1
close	1
to	1
his,	1
said,	1
“Yes,	1
my	1
dear	1
lord,	1
you	1
are	1
the	1
true	1
master	1
of	1
this	1
your	1
slave,	1
even	1
though	1
adverse	1
fate	1
interpose	1
again,	1
and	1
fresh	1
dangers	1
threaten	1
this	1
life	1
that	1
hangs	1
on	1
yours.”	1
A	1
strange	1
sight	1
was	1
this	1
for	1
Don	1
Fernando	1
and	1
those	1
that	1
stood	1
around,	1
filled	1
with	1
surprise	1
at	1
an	1
incident	1
so	1
unlooked	1
for.	1
Dorothea	1
fancied	1
that	1
Don	1
Fernando	1
changed	1
colour	1
and	1
looked	1
as	1
though	1
he	1
meant	1
to	1
take	1
vengeance	1
on	1
Cardenio,	1
for	1
she	1
observed	1
him	1
put	1
his	1
hand	1
to	1
his	1
sword;	1
and	1
the	1
instant	1
the	1
idea	1
struck	1
her,	1
with	1
wonderful	1
quickness	1
she	1
clasped	1
him	1
round	1
the	1
knees,	1
and	1
kissing	1
them	1
and	1
holding	1
him	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
prevent	1
his	1
moving,	1
she	1
said,	1
while	1
her	1
tears	1
continued	1
to	1
flow,	1
“What	1
is	1
it	1
thou	1
wouldst	1
do,	1
my	1
only	1
refuge,	1
in	1
this	1
unforeseen	1
event?	1
Thou	1
hast	1
thy	1
wife	1
at	1
thy	1
feet,	1
and	1
she	1
whom	1
thou	1
wouldst	1
have	1
for	1
thy	1
wife	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
arms	1
of	1
her	1
husband:	1
reflect	1
whether	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
right	1
for	1
thee,	1
whether	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
possible	1
for	1
thee	1
to	1
undo	1
what	1
Heaven	1
has	1
done,	1
or	1
whether	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
becoming	1
in	1
thee	1
to	1
seek	1
to	1
raise	1
her	1
to	1
be	1
thy	1
mate	1
who	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
every	1
obstacle,	1
and	1
strong	1
in	1
her	1
truth	1
and	1
constancy,	1
is	1
before	1
thine	1
eyes,	1
bathing	1
with	1
the	1
tears	1
of	1
love	1
the	1
face	1
and	1
bosom	1
of	1
her	1
lawful	1
husband.	1
For	1
God’s	1
sake	1
I	1
entreat	1
of	1
thee,	1
for	1
thine	1
own	1
I	1
implore	1
thee,	1
let	1
not	1
this	1
open	1
manifestation	1
rouse	1
thy	1
anger;	1
but	1
rather	1
so	1
calm	1
it	1
as	1
to	1
allow	1
these	1
two	1
lovers	1
to	1
live	1
in	1
peace	1
and	1
quiet	1
without	1
any	1
interference	1
from	1
thee	1
so	1
long	1
as	1
Heaven	1
permits	1
them;	1
and	1
in	1
so	1
doing	1
thou	1
wilt	1
prove	1
the	1
generosity	1
of	1
thy	1
lofty	1
noble	1
spirit,	1
and	1
the	1
world	1
shall	1
see	1
that	1
with	1
thee	1
reason	1
has	1
more	1
influence	1
than	1
passion.”	1
All	1
the	1
time	1
Dorothea	1
was	1
speaking,	1
Cardenio,	1
though	1
he	1
held	1
Luscinda	1
in	1
his	1
arms,	1
never	1
took	1
his	1
eyes	1
off	1
Don	1
Fernando,	1
determined,	1
if	1
he	1
saw	1
him	1
make	1
any	1
hostile	1
movement,	1
to	1
try	1
and	1
defend	1
himself	1
and	1
resist	1
as	1
best	1
he	1
could	1
all	1
who	1
might	1
assail	1
him,	1
though	1
it	1
should	1
cost	1
him	1
his	1
life.	1
But	1
now	1
Don	1
Fernando’s	1
friends,	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
the	1
curate	1
and	1
the	1
barber,	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
present	1
all	1
the	1
while,	1
not	1
forgetting	1
the	1
worthy	1
Sancho	1
Panza,	1
ran	1
forward	1
and	1
gathered	1
round	1
Don	1
Fernando,	1
entreating	1
him	1
to	1
have	1
regard	1
for	1
the	1
tears	1
of	1
Dorothea,	1
and	1
not	1
suffer	1
her	1
reasonable	1
hopes	1
to	1
be	1
disappointed,	1
since,	1
as	1
they	1
firmly	1
believed,	1
what	1
she	1
said	1
was	1
but	1
the	1
truth;	1
and	1
bidding	1
him	1
observe	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
not,	1
as	1
it	1
might	1
seem,	1
by	1
accident,	1
but	1
by	1
a	1
special	1
disposition	1
of	1
Providence	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
all	1
met	1
in	1
a	1
place	1
where	1
no	1
one	1
could	1
have	1
expected	1
a	1
meeting.	1
And	1
the	1
curate	1
bade	1
him	1
remember	1
that	1
only	1
death	1
could	1
part	1
Luscinda	1
from	1
Cardenio;	1
that	1
even	1
if	1
some	1
sword	1
were	1
to	1
separate	1
them	1
they	1
would	1
think	1
their	1
death	1
most	1
happy;	1
and	1
that	1
in	1
a	1
case	1
that	1
admitted	1
of	1
no	1
remedy	1
his	1
wisest	1
course	1
was,	1
by	1
conquering	1
and	1
putting	1
a	1
constraint	1
upon	1
himself,	1
to	1
show	1
a	1
generous	1
mind,	1
and	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
accord	1
suffer	1
these	1
two	1
to	1
enjoy	1
the	1
happiness	1
Heaven	1
had	1
granted	1
them.	1
He	1
bade	1
him,	1
too,	1
turn	1
his	1
eyes	1
upon	1
the	1
beauty	1
of	1
Dorothea	1
and	1
he	1
would	1
see	1
that	1
few	1
if	1
any	1
could	1
equal	1
much	1
less	1
excel	1
her;	1
while	1
to	1
that	1
beauty	1
should	1
be	1
added	1
her	1
modesty	1
and	1
the	1
surpassing	1
love	1
she	1
bore	1
him.	1
But	1
besides	1
all	1
this,	1
he	1
reminded	1
him	1
that	1
if	1
he	1
prided	1
himself	1
on	1
being	1
a	1
gentleman	1
and	1
a	1
Christian,	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
do	1
otherwise	1
than	1
keep	1
his	1
plighted	1
word;	1
and	1
that	1
in	1
doing	1
so	1
he	1
would	1
obey	1
God	1
and	1
meet	1
the	1
approval	1
of	1
all	1
sensible	1
people,	1
who	1
know	1
and	1
recognised	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
privilege	1
of	1
beauty,	1
even	1
in	1
one	1
of	1
humble	1
birth,	1
provided	1
virtue	1
accompany	1
it,	1
to	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
raise	1
itself	1
to	1
the	1
level	1
of	1
any	1
rank,	1
without	1
any	1
slur	1
upon	1
him	1
who	1
places	1
it	1
upon	1
an	1
equality	1
with	1
himself;	1
and	1
furthermore	1
that	1
when	1
the	1
potent	1
sway	1
of	1
passion	1
asserts	1
itself,	1
so	1
long	1
as	1
there	1
be	1
no	1
mixture	1
of	1
sin	1
in	1
it,	1
he	1
is	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
blamed	1
who	1
gives	1
way	1
to	1
it.	1
To	1
be	1
brief,	1
they	1
added	1
to	1
these	1
such	1
other	1
forcible	1
arguments	1
that	1
Don	1
Fernando’s	1
manly	1
heart,	1
being	1
after	1
all	1
nourished	1
by	1
noble	1
blood,	1
was	1
touched,	1
and	1
yielded	1
to	1
the	1
truth	1
which,	1
even	1
had	1
he	1
wished	1
it,	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
gainsay;	1
and	1
he	1
showed	1
his	1
submission,	1
and	1
acceptance	1
of	1
the	1
good	1
advice	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
offered	1
to	1
him,	1
by	1
stooping	1
down	1
and	1
embracing	1
Dorothea,	1
saying	1
to	1
her,	1
“Rise,	1
dear	1
lady,	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
right	1
that	1
what	1
I	1
hold	1
in	1
my	1
heart	1
should	1
be	1
kneeling	1
at	1
my	1
feet;	1
and	1
if	1
until	1
now	1
I	1
have	1
shown	1
no	1
sign	1
of	1
what	1
I	1
own,	1
it	1
may	1
have	1
been	1
by	1
Heaven’s	1
decree	1
in	1
order	1
that,	1
seeing	1
the	1
constancy	1
with	1
which	1
you	1
love	1
me,	1
I	1
may	1
learn	1
to	1
value	1
you	1
as	1
you	1
deserve.	1
What	1
I	1
entreat	1
of	1
you	1
is	1
that	1
you	1
reproach	1
me	1
not	1
with	1
my	1
transgression	1
and	1
grievous	1
wrong-doing;	1
for	1
the	1
same	1
cause	1
and	1
force	1
that	1
drove	1
me	1
to	1
make	1
you	1
mine	1
impelled	1
me	1
to	1
struggle	1
against	1
being	1
yours;	1
and	1
to	1
prove	1
this,	1
turn	1
and	1
look	1
at	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
the	1
now	1
happy	1
Luscinda,	1
and	1
you	1
will	1
see	1
in	1
them	1
an	1
excuse	1
for	1
all	1
my	1
errors:	1
and	1
as	1
she	1
has	1
found	1
and	1
gained	1
the	1
object	1
of	1
her	1
desires,	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
found	1
in	1
you	1
what	1
satisfies	1
all	1
my	1
wishes,	1
may	1
she	1
live	1
in	1
peace	1
and	1
contentment	1
as	1
many	1
happy	1
years	1
with	1
her	1
Cardenio,	1
as	1
on	1
my	1
knees	1
I	1
pray	1
Heaven	1
to	1
allow	1
me	1
to	1
live	1
with	1
my	1
Dorothea;”	1
and	1
with	1
these	1
words	1
he	1
once	1
more	1
embraced	1
her	1
and	1
pressed	1
his	1
face	1
to	1
hers	1
with	1
so	1
much	1
tenderness	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
take	1
great	1
heed	1
to	1
keep	1
his	1
tears	1
from	1
completing	1
the	1
proof	1
of	1
his	1
love	1
and	1
repentance	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
all.	1
Not	1
so	1
Luscinda,	1
and	1
Cardenio,	1
and	1
almost	1
all	1
the	1
others,	1
for	1
they	1
shed	1
so	1
many	1
tears,	1
some	1
in	1
their	1
own	1
happiness,	1
some	1
at	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
others,	1
that	1
one	1
would	1
have	1
supposed	1
a	1
heavy	1
calamity	1
had	1
fallen	1
upon	1
them	1
all.	1
Even	1
Sancho	1
Panza	1
was	1
weeping;	1
though	1
afterwards	1
he	1
said	1
he	1
only	1
wept	1
because	1
he	1
saw	1
that	1
Dorothea	1
was	1
not	1
as	1
he	1
fancied	1
the	1
queen	1
Micomicona,	1
of	1
whom	1
he	1
expected	1
such	1
great	1
favours.	1
Their	1
wonder	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
their	1
weeping	1
lasted	1
some	1
time,	1
and	1
then	1
Cardenio	1
and	1
Luscinda	1
went	1
and	1
fell	1
on	1
their	1
knees	1
before	1
Don	1
Fernando,	1
returning	1
him	1
thanks	1
for	1
the	1
favour	1
he	1
had	1
rendered	1
them	1
in	1
language	1
so	1
grateful	1
that	1
he	1
knew	1
not	1
how	1
to	1
answer	1
them,	1
and	1
raising	1
them	1
up	1
embraced	1
them	1
with	1
every	1
mark	1
of	1
affection	1
and	1
courtesy.	1
He	1
then	1
asked	1
Dorothea	1
how	1
she	1
had	1
managed	1
to	1
reach	1
a	1
place	1
so	1
far	1
removed	1
from	1
her	1
own	1
home,	1
and	1
she	1
in	1
a	1
few	1
fitting	1
words	1
told	1
all	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
previously	1
related	1
to	1
Cardenio,	1
with	1
which	1
Don	1
Fernando	1
and	1
his	1
companions	1
were	1
so	1
delighted	1
that	1
they	1
wished	1
the	1
story	1
had	1
been	1
longer;	1
so	1
charmingly	1
did	1
Dorothea	1
describe	1
her	1
misadventures.	1
When	1
she	1
had	1
finished	1
Don	1
Fernando	1
recounted	1
what	1
had	1
befallen	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
city	1
after	1
he	1
had	1
found	1
in	1
Luscinda’s	1
bosom	1
the	1
paper	1
in	1
which	1
she	1
declared	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
Cardenio’s	1
wife,	1
and	1
never	1
could	1
be	1
his.	1
He	1
said	1
he	1
meant	1
to	1
kill	1
her,	1
and	1
would	1
have	1
done	1
so	1
had	1
he	1
not	1
been	1
prevented	1
by	1
her	1
parents,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
quitted	1
the	1
house	1
full	1
of	1
rage	1
and	1
shame,	1
and	1
resolved	1
to	1
avenge	1
himself	1
when	1
a	1
more	1
convenient	1
opportunity	1
should	1
offer.	1
The	1
next	1
day	1
he	1
learned	1
that	1
Luscinda	1
had	1
disappeared	1
from	1
her	1
father’s	1
house,	1
and	1
that	1
no	1
one	1
could	1
tell	1
whither	1
she	1
had	1
gone.	1
Finally,	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
some	1
months	1
he	1
ascertained	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
in	1
a	1
convent	1
and	1
meant	1
to	1
remain	1
there	1
all	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
her	1
life,	1
if	1
she	1
were	1
not	1
to	1
share	1
it	1
with	1
Cardenio;	1
and	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
learned	1
this,	1
taking	1
these	1
three	1
gentlemen	1
as	1
his	1
companions,	1
he	1
arrived	1
at	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
she	1
was,	1
but	1
avoided	1
speaking	1
to	1
her,	1
fearing	1
that	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
known	1
he	1
was	1
there	1
stricter	1
precautions	1
would	1
be	1
taken	1
in	1
the	1
convent;	1
and	1
watching	1
a	1
time	1
when	1
the	1
porter’s	1
lodge	1
was	1
open	1
he	1
left	1
two	1
to	1
guard	1
the	1
gate,	1
and	1
he	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
entered	1
the	1
convent	1
in	1
quest	1
of	1
Luscinda,	1
whom	1
they	1
found	1
in	1
the	1
cloisters	1
in	1
conversation	1
with	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
nuns,	1
and	1
carrying	1
her	1
off	1
without	1
giving	1
her	1
time	1
to	1
resist,	1
they	1
reached	1
a	1
place	1
with	1
her	1
where	1
they	1
provided	1
themselves	1
with	1
what	1
they	1
required	1
for	1
taking	1
her	1
away;	1
all	1
which	1
they	1
were	1
able	1
to	1
do	1
in	1
complete	1
safety,	1
as	1
the	1
convent	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
country	1
at	1
a	1
considerable	1
distance	1
from	1
the	1
city.	1
He	1
added	1
that	1
when	1
Luscinda	1
found	1
herself	1
in	1
his	1
power	1
she	1
lost	1
all	1
consciousness,	1
and	1
after	1
returning	1
to	1
herself	1
did	1
nothing	1
but	1
weep	1
and	1
sigh	1
without	1
speaking	1
a	1
word;	1
and	1
thus	1
in	1
silence	1
and	1
tears	1
they	1
reached	1
that	1
inn,	1
which	1
for	1
him	1
was	1
reaching	1
heaven	1
where	1
all	1
the	1
mischances	1
of	1
earth	1
are	1
over	1
and	1
at	1
an	1
end.	1

To	1
all	1
this	1
Sancho	1
listened	1
with	1
no	1
little	1
sorrow	1
at	1
heart	1
to	1
see	1
how	1
his	1
hopes	1
of	1
dignity	1
were	1
fading	1
away	1
and	1
vanishing	1
in	1
smoke,	1
and	1
how	1
the	1
fair	1
Princess	1
Micomicona	1
had	1
turned	1
into	1
Dorothea,	1
and	1
the	1
giant	1
into	1
Don	1
Fernando,	1
while	1
his	1
master	1
was	1
sleeping	1
tranquilly,	1
totally	1
unconscious	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
pass.	1
Dorothea	1
was	1
unable	1
to	1
persuade	1
herself	1
that	1
her	1
present	1
happiness	1
was	1
not	1
all	1
a	1
dream;	1
Cardenio	1
was	1
in	1
a	1
similar	1
state	1
of	1
mind,	1
and	1
Luscinda’s	1
thoughts	1
ran	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
direction.	1
Don	1
Fernando	1
gave	1
thanks	1
to	1
Heaven	1
for	1
the	1
favour	1
shown	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
for	1
having	1
been	1
rescued	1
from	1
the	1
intricate	1
labyrinth	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
brought	1
so	1
near	1
the	1
destruction	1
of	1
his	1
good	1
name	1
and	1
of	1
his	1
soul;	1
and	1
in	1
short	1
everybody	1
in	1
the	1
inn	1
was	1
full	1
of	1
contentment	1
and	1
satisfaction	1
at	1
the	1
happy	1
issue	1
of	1
such	1
a	1
complicated	1
and	1
hopeless	1
business.	1
The	1
curate	1
as	1
a	1
sensible	1
man	1
made	1
sound	1
reflections	1
upon	1
the	1
whole	1
affair,	1
and	1
congratulated	1
each	1
upon	1
his	1
good	1
fortune;	1
but	1
the	1
one	1
that	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
highest	1
spirits	1
and	1
good	1
humour	1
was	1
the	1
landlady,	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
promise	1
Cardenio	1
and	1
the	1
curate	1
had	1
given	1
her	1
to	1
pay	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
losses	1
and	1
damage	1
she	1
had	1
sustained	1
through	1
Don	1
Quixote’s	1
means.	1
Sancho,	1
as	1
has	1
been	1
already	1
said,	1
was	1
the	1
only	1
one	1
who	1
was	1
distressed,	1
unhappy,	1
and	1
dejected;	1
and	1
so	1
with	1
a	1
long	1
face	1
he	1
went	1
in	1
to	1
his	1
master,	1
who	1
had	1
just	1
awoke,	1
and	1
said	1
to	1
him:	1
“Sir	1
Rueful	1
Countenance,	1
your	1
worship	1
may	1
as	1
well	1
sleep	1
on	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
you	1
like,	1
without	1
troubling	1
yourself	1
about	1
killing	1
any	1
giant	1
or	1
restoring	1
her	1
kingdom	1
to	1
the	1
princess;	1
for	1
that	1
is	1
all	1
over	1
and	1
settled	1
now.”	1
“I	1
should	1
think	1
it	1
was,”	1
replied	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“for	1
I	1
have	1
had	1
the	1
most	1
prodigious	1
and	1
stupendous	1
battle	1
with	1
the	1
giant	1
that	1
I	1
ever	1
remember	1
having	1
had	1
all	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
my	1
life;	1
and	1
with	1
one	1
back-stroke—swish!—I	1
brought	1
his	1
head	1
tumbling	1
to	1
the	1
ground,	1
and	1
so	1
much	1
blood	1
gushed	1
forth	1
from	1
him	1
that	1
it	1
ran	1
in	1
rivulets	1
over	1
the	1
earth	1
like	1
water.”	1
“Like	1
red	1
wine,	1
your	1
worship	1
had	1
better	1
say,”	1
replied	1
Sancho;	1
“for	1
I	1
would	1
have	1
you	1
know,	1
if	1
you	1
don’t	1
know	1
it,	1
that	1
the	1
dead	1
giant	1
is	1
a	1
hacked	1
wine-skin,	1
and	1
the	1
blood	1
four-and-twenty	1
gallons	1
of	1
red	1
wine	1
that	1
it	1
had	1
in	1
its	1
belly,	1
and	1
the	1
cut-off	1
head	1
is	1
the	1
bitch	1
that	1
bore	1
me;	1
and	1
the	1
devil	1
take	1
it	1
all.”	1
“What	1
art	1
thou	1
talking	1
about,	1
fool?”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
“art	1
thou	1
in	1
thy	1
senses?”	1
“Let	1
your	1
worship	1
get	1
up,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“and	1
you	1
will	1
see	1
the	1
nice	1
business	1
you	1
have	1
made	1
of	1
it,	1
and	1
what	1
we	1
have	1
to	1
pay;	1
and	1
you	1
will	1
see	1
the	1
queen	1
turned	1
into	1
a	1
private	1
lady	1
called	1
Dorothea,	1
and	1
other	1
things	1
that	1
will	1
astonish	1
you,	1
if	1
you	1
understand	1
them.”	1
“I	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
surprised	1
at	1
anything	1
of	1
the	1
kind,”	1
returned	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
“for	1
if	1
thou	1
dost	1
remember	1
the	1
last	1
time	1
we	1
were	1
here	1
I	1
told	1
thee	1
that	1
everything	1
that	1
happened	1
here	1
was	1
a	1
matter	1
of	1
enchantment,	1
and	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
no	1
wonder	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
the	1
same	1
now.”	1
“I	1
could	1
believe	1
all	1
that,”	1
replied	1
Sancho,	1
“if	1
my	1
blanketing	1
was	1
the	1
same	1
sort	1
of	1
thing	1
also;	1
only	1
it	1
wasn’t,	1
but	1
real	1
and	1
genuine;	1
for	1
I	1
saw	1
the	1
landlord,	1
who	1
is	1
here	1
to-day,	1
holding	1
one	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
blanket	1
and	1
jerking	1
me	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
skies	1
very	1
neatly	1
and	1
smartly,	1
and	1
with	1
as	1
much	1
laughter	1
as	1
strength;	1
and	1
when	1
it	1
comes	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
case	1
of	1
knowing	1
people,	1
I	1
hold	1
for	1
my	1
part,	1
simple	1
and	1
sinner	1
as	1
I	1
am,	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
enchantment	1
about	1
it	1
at	1
all,	1
but	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
of	1
bruising	1
and	1
bad	1
luck.”	1
“Well,	1
well,	1
God	1
will	1
give	1
a	1
remedy,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
“hand	1
me	1
my	1
clothes	1
and	1
let	1
me	1
go	1
out,	1
for	1
I	1
want	1
to	1
see	1
these	1
transformations	1
and	1
things	1
thou	1
speakest	1
of.”	1
Sancho	1
fetched	1
him	1
his	1
clothes;	1
and	1
while	1
he	1
was	1
dressing,	1
the	1
curate	1
gave	1
Don	1
Fernando	1
and	1
the	1
others	1
present	1
an	1
account	1
of	1
Don	1
Quixote’s	1
madness	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
stratagem	1
they	1
had	1
made	1
use	1
of	1
to	1
withdraw	1
him	1
from	1
that	1
Pena	1
Pobre	1
where	1
he	1
fancied	1
himself	1
stationed	1
because	1
of	1
his	1
lady’s	1
scorn.	1
He	1
described	1
to	1
them	1
also	1
nearly	1
all	1
the	1
adventures	1
that	1
Sancho	1
had	1
mentioned,	1
at	1
which	1
they	1
marvelled	1
and	1
laughed	1
not	1
a	1
little,	1
thinking	1
it,	1
as	1
all	1
did,	1
the	1
strangest	1
form	1
of	1
madness	1
a	1
crazy	1
intellect	1
could	1
be	1
capable	1
of.	1
But	1
now,	1
the	1
curate	1
said,	1
that	1
the	1
lady	1
Dorothea’s	1
good	1
fortune	1
prevented	1
her	1
from	1
proceeding	1
with	1
their	1
purpose,	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
necessary	1
to	1
devise	1
or	1
discover	1
some	1
other	1
way	1
of	1
getting	1
him	1
home.	1
Cardenio	1
proposed	1
to	1
carry	1
out	1
the	1
scheme	1
they	1
had	1
begun,	1
and	1
suggested	1
that	1
Luscinda	1
would	1
act	1
and	1
support	1
Dorothea’s	1
part	1
sufficiently	1
well.	1
“No,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Fernando,	1
“that	1
must	1
not	1
be,	1
for	1
I	1
want	1
Dorothea	1
to	1
follow	1
out	1
this	1
idea	1
of	1
hers;	1
and	1
if	1
the	1
worthy	1
gentleman’s	1
village	1
is	1
not	1
very	1
far	1
off,	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
happy	1
if	1
I	1
can	1
do	1
anything	1
for	1
his	1
relief.”	1
“It	1
is	1
not	1
more	1
than	1
two	1
days’	1
journey	1
from	1
this,”	1
said	1
the	1
curate.	1
“Even	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
more,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Fernando,	1
“I	1
would	1
gladly	1
travel	1
so	1
far	1
for	1
the	1
sake	1
of	1
doing	1
so	1
good	1
a	1
work.”	1
At	1
this	1
moment	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
came	1
out	1
in	1
full	1
panoply,	1
with	1
Mambrino’s	1
helmet,	1
all	1
dinted	1
as	1
it	1
was,	1
on	1
his	1
head,	1
his	1
buckler	1
on	1
his	1
arm,	1
and	1
leaning	1
on	1
his	1
staff	1
or	1
pike.	1
The	1
strange	1
figure	1
he	1
presented	1
filled	1
Don	1
Fernando	1
and	1
the	1
rest	1
with	1
amazement	1
as	1
they	1
contemplated	1
his	1
lean	1
yellow	1
face	1
half	1
a	1
league	1
long,	1
his	1
armour	1
of	1
all	1
sorts,	1
and	1
the	1
solemnity	1
of	1
his	1
deportment.	1
They	1
stood	1
silent	1
waiting	1
to	1
see	1
what	1
he	1
would	1
say,	1
and	1
he,	1
fixing	1
his	1
eyes	1
on	1
the	1
fair	1
Dorothea,	1
addressed	1
her	1
with	1
great	1
gravity	1
and	1
composure:	1
“I	1
am	1
informed,	1
fair	1
lady,	1
by	1
my	1
squire	1
here	1
that	1
your	1
greatness	1
has	1
been	1
annihilated	1
and	1
your	1
being	1
abolished,	1
since,	1
from	1
a	1
queen	1
and	1
lady	1
of	1
high	1
degree	1
as	1
you	1
used	1
to	1
be,	1
you	1
have	1
been	1
turned	1
into	1
a	1
private	1
maiden.	1
If	1
this	1
has	1
been	1
done	1
by	1
the	1
command	1
of	1
the	1
magician	1
king	1
your	1
father,	1
through	1
fear	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
not	1
afford	1
you	1
the	1
aid	1
you	1
need	1
and	1
are	1
entitled	1
to,	1
I	1
may	1
tell	1
you	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
and	1
does	1
not	1
know	1
half	1
the	1
mass,	1
and	1
was	1
little	1
versed	1
in	1
the	1
annals	1
of	1
chivalry;	1
for,	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
read	1
and	1
gone	1
through	1
them	1
as	1
attentively	1
and	1
deliberately	1
as	1
I	1
have,	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
found	1
at	1
every	1
turn	1
that	1
knights	1
of	1
less	1
renown	1
than	1
mine	1
have	1
accomplished	1
things	1
more	1
difficult:	1
it	1
is	1
no	1
great	1
matter	1
to	1
kill	1
a	1
whelp	1
of	1
a	1
giant,	1
however	1
arrogant	1
he	1
may	1
be;	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
many	1
hours	1
since	1
I	1
myself	1
was	1
engaged	1
with	1
one,	1
and—I	1
will	1
not	1
speak	1
of	1
it,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
not	1
say	1
I	1
am	1
lying;	1
time,	1
however,	1
that	1
reveals	1
all,	1
will	1
tell	1
the	1
tale	1
when	1
we	1
least	1
expect	1
it.”	1
“You	1
were	1
engaged	1
with	1
a	1
couple	1
of	1
wine-skins,	1
and	1
not	1
a	1
giant,”	1
said	1
the	1
landlord	1
at	1
this;	1
but	1
Don	1
Fernando	1
told	1
him	1
to	1
hold	1
his	1
tongue	1
and	1
on	1
no	1
account	1
interrupt	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
who	1
continued,	1
“I	1
say	1
in	1
conclusion,	1
high	1
and	1
disinherited	1
lady,	1
that	1
if	1
your	1
father	1
has	1
brought	1
about	1
this	1
metamorphosis	1
in	1
your	1
person	1
for	1
the	1
reason	1
I	1
have	1
mentioned,	1
you	1
ought	1
not	1
to	1
attach	1
any	1
importance	1
to	1
it;	1
for	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
peril	1
on	1
earth	1
through	1
which	1
my	1
sword	1
will	1
not	1
force	1
a	1
way,	1
and	1
with	1
it,	1
before	1
many	1
days	1
are	1
over,	1
I	1
will	1
bring	1
your	1
enemy’s	1
head	1
to	1
the	1
ground	1
and	1
place	1
on	1
yours	1
the	1
crown	1
of	1
your	1
kingdom.”	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
said	1
no	1
more,	1
and	1
waited	1
for	1
the	1
reply	1
of	1
the	1
princess,	1
who	1
aware	1
of	1
Don	1
Fernando’s	1
determination	1
to	1
carry	1
on	1
the	1
deception	1
until	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
had	1
been	1
conveyed	1
to	1
his	1
home,	1
with	1
great	1
ease	1
of	1
manner	1
and	1
gravity	1
made	1
answer,	1
“Whoever	1
told	1
you,	1
valiant	1
Knight	1
of	1
the	1
Rueful	1
Countenance,	1
that	1
I	1
had	1
undergone	1
any	1
change	1
or	1
transformation	1
did	1
not	1
tell	1
you	1
the	1
truth,	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
same	1
as	1
I	1
was	1
yesterday.	1
It	1
is	1
true	1
that	1
certain	1
strokes	1
of	1
good	1
fortune,	1
that	1
have	1
given	1
me	1
more	1
than	1
I	1
could	1
have	1
hoped	1
for,	1
have	1
made	1
some	1
alteration	1
in	1
me;	1
but	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
therefore	1
ceased	1
to	1
be	1
what	1
I	1
was	1
before,	1
or	1
to	1
entertain	1
the	1
same	1
desire	1
I	1
have	1
had	1
all	1
through	1
of	1
availing	1
myself	1
of	1
the	1
might	1
of	1
your	1
valiant	1
and	1
invincible	1
arm.	1
And	1
so,	1
señor,	1
let	1
your	1
goodness	1
reinstate	1
the	1
father	1
that	1
begot	1
me	1
in	1
your	1
good	1
opinion,	1
and	1
be	1
assured	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
wise	1
and	1
prudent	1
man,	1
since	1
by	1
his	1
craft	1
he	1
found	1
out	1
such	1
a	1
sure	1
and	1
easy	1
way	1
of	1
remedying	1
my	1
misfortune;	1
for	1
I	1
believe,	1
señor,	1
that	1
had	1
it	1
not	1
been	1
for	1
you	1
I	1
should	1
never	1
have	1
lit	1
upon	1
the	1
good	1
fortune	1
I	1
now	1
possess;	1
and	1
in	1
this	1
I	1
am	1
saying	1
what	1
is	1
perfectly	1
true;	1
as	1
most	1
of	1
these	1
gentlemen	1
who	1
are	1
present	1
can	1
fully	1
testify.	1
All	1
that	1
remains	1
is	1
to	1
set	1
out	1
on	1
our	1
journey	1
to-morrow,	1
for	1
to-day	1
we	1
could	1
not	1
make	1
much	1
way;	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
happy	1
result	1
I	1
am	1
looking	1
forward	1
to,	1
I	1
trust	1
to	1
God	1
and	1
the	1
valour	1
of	1
your	1
heart.”	1
So	1
said	1
the	1
sprightly	1
Dorothea,	1
and	1
on	1
hearing	1
her	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
turned	1
to	1
Sancho,	1
and	1
said	1
to	1
him,	1
with	1
an	1
angry	1
air,	1
“I	1
declare	1
now,	1
little	1
Sancho,	1
thou	1
art	1
the	1
greatest	1
little	1
villain	1
in	1
Spain.	1
Say,	1
thief	1
and	1
vagabond,	1
hast	1
thou	1
not	1
just	1
now	1
told	1
me	1
that	1
this	1
princess	1
had	1
been	1
turned	1
into	1
a	1
maiden	1
called	1
Dorothea,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
head	1
which	1
I	1
am	1
persuaded	1
I	1
cut	1
off	1
from	1
a	1
giant	1
was	1
the	1
bitch	1
that	1
bore	1
thee,	1
and	1
other	1
nonsense	1
that	1
put	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
greatest	1
perplexity	1
I	1
have	1
ever	1
been	1
in	1
all	1
my	1
life?	1
I	1
vow”	1
(and	1
here	1
he	1
looked	1
to	1
heaven	1
and	1
ground	1
his	1
teeth)	1
“I	1
have	1
a	1
mind	1
to	1
play	1
the	1
mischief	1
with	1
thee,	1
in	1
a	1
way	1
that	1
will	1
teach	1
sense	1
for	1
the	1
future	1
to	1
all	1
lying	1
squires	1
of	1
knights-errant	1
in	1
the	1
world.”	1
“Let	1
your	1
worship	1
be	1
calm,	1
señor,”	1
returned	1
Sancho,	1
“for	1
it	1
may	1
well	1
be	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
mistaken	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
change	1
of	1
the	1
lady	1
princess	1
Micomicona;	1
but	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
giant’s	1
head,	1
or	1
at	1
least	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
piercing	1
of	1
the	1
wine-skins,	1
and	1
the	1
blood	1
being	1
red	1
wine,	1
I	1
make	1
no	1
mistake,	1
as	1
sure	1
as	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
God;	1
because	1
the	1
wounded	1
skins	1
are	1
there	1
at	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
your	1
worship’s	1
bed,	1
and	1
the	1
wine	1
has	1
made	1
a	1
lake	1
of	1
the	1
room;	1
if	1
not	1
you	1
will	1
see	1
when	1
the	1
eggs	1
come	1
to	1
be	1
fried;	1
I	1
mean	1
when	1
his	1
worship	1
the	1
landlord	1
calls	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
damages:	1
for	1
the	1
rest,	1
I	1
am	1
heartily	1
glad	1
that	1
her	1
ladyship	1
the	1
queen	1
is	1
as	1
she	1
was,	1
for	1
it	1
concerns	1
me	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
anyone.”	1
“I	1
tell	1
thee	1
again,	1
Sancho,	1
thou	1
art	1
a	1
fool,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
“forgive	1
me,	1
and	1
that	1
will	1
do.”	1
“That	1
will	1
do,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Fernando;	1
“let	1
us	1
say	1
no	1
more	1
about	1
it;	1
and	1
as	1
her	1
ladyship	1
the	1
princess	1
proposes	1
to	1
set	1
out	1
to-morrow	1
because	1
it	1
is	1
too	1
late	1
to-day,	1
so	1
be	1
it,	1
and	1
we	1
will	1
pass	1
the	1
night	1
in	1
pleasant	1
conversation,	1
and	1
to-morrow	1
we	1
will	1
all	1
accompany	1
Señor	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
for	1
we	1
wish	1
to	1
witness	1
the	1
valiant	1
and	1
unparalleled	1
achievements	1
he	1
is	1
about	1
to	1
perform	1
in	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
this	1
mighty	1
enterprise	1
which	1
he	1
has	1
undertaken.”	1
“It	1
is	1
I	1
who	1
shall	1
wait	1
upon	1
and	1
accompany	1
you,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
“and	1
I	1
am	1
much	1
gratified	1
by	1
the	1
favour	1
that	1
is	1
bestowed	1
upon	1
me,	1
and	1
the	1
good	1
opinion	1
entertained	1
of	1
me,	1
which	1
I	1
shall	1
strive	1
to	1
justify	1
or	1
it	1
shall	1
cost	1
me	1
my	1
life,	1
or	1
even	1
more,	1
if	1
it	1
can	1
possibly	1
cost	1
me	1
more.”	1
Many	1
were	1
the	1
compliments	1
and	1
expressions	1
of	1
politeness	1
that	1
passed	1
between	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
and	1
Don	1
Fernando;	1
but	1
they	1
were	1
brought	1
to	1
an	1
end	1
by	1
a	1
traveller	1
who	1
at	1
this	1
moment	1
entered	1
the	1
inn,	1
and	1
who	1
seemed	1
from	1
his	1
attire	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
Christian	1
lately	1
come	1
from	1
the	1
country	1
of	1
the	1
Moors,	1
for	1
he	1
was	1
dressed	1
in	1
a	1
short-skirted	1
coat	1
of	1
blue	1
cloth	1
with	1
half-sleeves	1
and	1
without	1
a	1
collar;	1
his	1
breeches	1
were	1
also	1
of	1
blue	1
cloth,	1
and	1
his	1
cap	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
colour,	1
and	1
he	1
wore	1
yellow	1
buskins	1
and	1
had	1
a	1
Moorish	1
cutlass	1
slung	1
from	1
a	1
baldric	1
across	1
his	1
breast.	1
Behind	1
him,	1
mounted	1
upon	1
an	1
ass,	1
there	1
came	1
a	1
woman	1
dressed	1
in	1
Moorish	1
fashion,	1
with	1
her	1
face	1
veiled	1
and	1
a	1
scarf	1
on	1
her	1
head,	1
and	1
wearing	1
a	1
little	1
brocaded	1
cap,	1
and	1
a	1
mantle	1
that	1
covered	1
her	1
from	1
her	1
shoulders	1
to	1
her	1
feet.	1
The	1
man	1
was	1
of	1
a	1
robust	1
and	1
well-proportioned	1
frame,	1
in	1
age	1
a	1
little	1
over	1
forty,	1
rather	1
swarthy	1
in	1
complexion,	1
with	1
long	1
moustaches	1
and	1
a	1
full	1
beard,	1
and,	1
in	1
short,	1
his	1
appearance	1
was	1
such	1
that	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
well	1
dressed	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
taken	1
for	1
a	1
person	1
of	1
quality	1
and	1
good	1
birth.	1
On	1
entering	1
he	1
asked	1
for	1
a	1
room,	1
and	1
when	1
they	1
told	1
him	1
there	1
was	1
none	1
in	1
the	1
inn	1
he	1
seemed	1
distressed,	1
and	1
approaching	1
her	1
who	1
by	1
her	1
dress	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
Moor,	1
he	1
took	1
her	1
down	1
from	1
the	1
saddle	1
in	1
his	1
arms.	1
Luscinda,	1
Dorothea,	1
the	1
landlady,	1
her	1
daughter	1
and	1
Maritornes,	1
attracted	1
by	1
the	1
strange,	1
and	1
to	1
them	1
entirely	1
new	1
costume,	1
gathered	1
round	1
her;	1
and	1
Dorothea,	1
who	1
was	1
always	1
kindly,	1
courteous,	1
and	1
quick-witted,	1
perceiving	1
that	1
both	1
she	1
and	1
the	1
man	1
who	1
had	1
brought	1
her	1
were	1
annoyed	1
at	1
not	1
finding	1
a	1
room,	1
said	1
to	1
her,	1
“Do	1
not	1
be	1
put	1
out,	1
señora,	1
by	1
the	1
discomfort	1
and	1
want	1
of	1
luxuries	1
here,	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
road-side	1
inns	1
to	1
be	1
without	1
them;	1
still,	1
if	1
you	1
will	1
be	1
pleased	1
to	1
share	1
our	1
lodging	1
with	1
us	1
(pointing	1
to	1
Luscinda)	1
perhaps	1
you	1
will	1
have	1
found	1
worse	1
accommodation	1
in	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
your	1
journey.”	1
To	1
this	1
the	1
veiled	1
lady	1
made	1
no	1
reply;	1
all	1
she	1
did	1
was	1
to	1
rise	1
from	1
her	1
seat,	1
crossing	1
her	1
hands	1
upon	1
her	1
bosom,	1
bowing	1
her	1
head	1
and	1
bending	1
her	1
body	1
as	1
a	1
sign	1
that	1
she	1
returned	1
thanks.	1
From	1
her	1
silence	1
they	1
concluded	1
that	1
she	1
must	1
be	1
a	1
Moor	1
and	1
unable	1
to	1
speak	1
a	1
Christian	1
tongue.	1
At	1
this	1
moment	1
the	1
captive	1
came	1
up,	1
having	1
been	1
until	1
now	1
otherwise	1
engaged,	1
and	1
seeing	1
that	1
they	1
all	1
stood	1
round	1
his	1
companion	1
and	1
that	1
she	1
made	1
no	1
reply	1
to	1
what	1
they	1
addressed	1
to	1
her,	1
he	1
said,	1
“Ladies,	1
this	1
damsel	1
hardly	1
understands	1
my	1
language	1
and	1
can	1
speak	1
none	1
but	1
that	1
of	1
her	1
own	1
country,	1
for	1
which	1
reason	1
she	1
does	1
not	1
and	1
cannot	1
answer	1
what	1
has	1
been	1
asked	1
of	1
her.”	1
“Nothing	1
has	1
been	1
asked	1
of	1
her,”	1
returned	1
Luscinda;	1
“she	1
has	1
only	1
been	1
offered	1
our	1
company	1
for	1
this	1
evening	1
and	1
a	1
share	1
of	1
the	1
quarters	1
we	1
occupy,	1
where	1
she	1
shall	1
be	1
made	1
as	1
comfortable	1
as	1
the	1
circumstances	1
allow,	1
with	1
the	1
good-will	1
we	1
are	1
bound	1
to	1
show	1
all	1
strangers	1
that	1
stand	1
in	1
need	1
of	1
it,	1
especially	1
if	1
it	1
be	1
a	1
woman	1
to	1
whom	1
the	1
service	1
is	1
rendered.”	1
“On	1
her	1
part	1
and	1
my	1
own,	1
señora,”	1
replied	1
the	1
captive,	1
“I	1
kiss	1
your	1
hands,	1
and	1
I	1
esteem	1
highly,	1
as	1
I	1
ought,	1
the	1
favour	1
you	1
have	1
offered,	1
which,	1
on	1
such	1
an	1
occasion	1
and	1
coming	1
from	1
persons	1
of	1
your	1
appearance,	1
is,	1
it	1
is	1
plain	1
to	1
see,	1
a	1
very	1
great	1
one.”	1
“Tell	1
me,	1
señor,”	1
said	1
Dorothea,	1
“is	1
this	1
lady	1
a	1
Christian	1
or	1
a	1
Moor?	1
for	1
her	1
dress	1
and	1
her	1
silence	1
lead	1
us	1
to	1
imagine	1
that	1
she	1
is	1
what	1
we	1
could	1
wish	1
she	1
was	1
not.”	1
“In	1
dress	1
and	1
outwardly,”	1
said	1
he,	1
“she	1
is	1
a	1
Moor,	1
but	1
at	1
heart	1
she	1
is	1
a	1
thoroughly	1
good	1
Christian,	1
for	1
she	1
has	1
the	1
greatest	1
desire	1
to	1
become	1
one.”	1
“Then	1
she	1
has	1
not	1
been	1
baptised?”	1
returned	1
Luscinda.	1
“There	1
has	1
been	1
no	1
opportunity	1
for	1
that,”	1
replied	1
the	1
captive,	1
“since	1
she	1
left	1
Algiers,	1
her	1
native	1
country	1
and	1
home;	1
and	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
present	1
she	1
has	1
not	1
found	1
herself	1
in	1
any	1
such	1
imminent	1
danger	1
of	1
death	1
as	1
to	1
make	1
it	1
necessary	1
to	1
baptise	1
her	1
before	1
she	1
has	1
been	1
instructed	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
ceremonies	1
our	1
holy	1
mother	1
Church	1
ordains;	1
but,	1
please	1
God,	1
ere	1
long	1
she	1
shall	1
be	1
baptised	1
with	1
the	1
solemnity	1
befitting	1
her	1
which	1
is	1
higher	1
than	1
her	1
dress	1
or	1
mine	1
indicates.”	1
By	1
these	1
words	1
he	1
excited	1
a	1
desire	1
in	1
all	1
who	1
heard	1
him,	1
to	1
know	1
who	1
the	1
Moorish	1
lady	1
and	1
the	1
captive	1
were,	1
but	1
no	1
one	1
liked	1
to	1
ask	1
just	1
then,	1
seeing	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
fitter	1
moment	1
for	1
helping	1
them	1
to	1
rest	1
themselves	1
than	1
for	1
questioning	1
them	1
about	1
their	1
lives.	1
Dorothea	1
took	1
the	1
Moorish	1
lady	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
and	1
leading	1
her	1
to	1
a	1
seat	1
beside	1
herself,	1
requested	1
her	1
to	1
remove	1
her	1
veil.	1
She	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
captive	1
as	1
if	1
to	1
ask	1
him	1
what	1
they	1
meant	1
and	1
what	1
she	1
was	1
to	1
do.	1
He	1
said	1
to	1
her	1
in	1
Arabic	1
that	1
they	1
asked	1
her	1
to	1
take	1
off	1
her	1
veil,	1
and	1
thereupon	1
she	1
removed	1
it	1
and	1
disclosed	1
a	1
countenance	1
so	1
lovely,	1
that	1
to	1
Dorothea	1
she	1
seemed	1
more	1
beautiful	1
than	1
Luscinda,	1
and	1
to	1
Luscinda	1
more	1
beautiful	1
than	1
Dorothea,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
bystanders	1
felt	1
that	1
if	1
any	1
beauty	1
could	1
compare	1
with	1
theirs	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
Moorish	1
lady’s,	1
and	1
there	1
were	1
even	1
those	1
who	1
were	1
inclined	1
to	1
give	1
it	1
somewhat	1
the	1
preference.	1
And	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
privilege	1
and	1
charm	1
of	1
beauty	1
to	1
win	1
the	1
heart	1
and	1
secure	1
good-will,	1
all	1
forthwith	1
became	1
eager	1
to	1
show	1
kindness	1
and	1
attention	1
to	1
the	1
lovely	1
Moor.	1
Don	1
Fernando	1
asked	1
the	1
captive	1
what	1
her	1
name	1
was,	1
and	1
he	1
replied	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
Lela	1
Zoraida;	1
but	1
the	1
instant	1
she	1
heard	1
him,	1
she	1
guessed	1
what	1
the	1
Christian	1
had	1
asked,	1
and	1
said	1
hastily,	1
with	1
some	1
displeasure	1
and	1
energy,	1
“No,	1
not	1
Zoraida;	1
Maria,	1
Maria!”	1
giving	1
them	1
to	1
understand	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
called	1
“Maria”	1
and	1
not	1
“Zoraida.”	1
These	1
words,	1
and	1
the	1
touching	1
earnestness	1
with	1
which	1
she	1
uttered	1
them,	1
drew	1
more	1
than	1
one	1
tear	1
from	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
listeners,	1
particularly	1
the	1
women,	1
who	1
are	1
by	1
nature	1
tender-hearted	1
and	1
compassionate.	1
Luscinda	1
embraced	1
her	1
affectionately,	1
saying,	1
“Yes,	1
yes,	1
Maria,	1
Maria,”	1
to	1
which	1
the	1
Moor	1
replied,	1
“Yes,	1
yes,	1
Maria;	1
Zoraida	1
macange,”	1
which	1
means	1
“not	1
Zoraida.”	1
Night	1
was	1
now	1
approaching,	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
orders	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
accompanied	1
Don	1
Fernando	1
the	1
landlord	1
had	1
taken	1
care	1
and	1
pains	1
to	1
prepare	1
for	1
them	1
the	1
best	1
supper	1
that	1
was	1
in	1
his	1
power.	1
The	1
hour	1
therefore	1
having	1
arrived	1
they	1
all	1
took	1
their	1
seats	1
at	1
a	1
long	1
table	1
like	1
a	1
refectory	1
one,	1
for	1
round	1
or	1
square	1
table	1
there	1
was	1
none	1
in	1
the	1
inn,	1
and	1
the	1
seat	1
of	1
honour	1
at	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
it,	1
though	1
he	1
was	1
for	1
refusing	1
it,	1
they	1
assigned	1
to	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
who	1
desired	1
the	1
lady	1
Micomicona	1
to	1
place	1
herself	1
by	1
his	1
side,	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
her	1
protector.	1
Luscinda	1
and	1
Zoraida	1
took	1
their	1
places	1
next	1
her,	1
opposite	1
to	1
them	1
were	1
Don	1
Fernando	1
and	1
Cardenio,	1
and	1
next	1
the	1
captive	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
gentlemen,	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
ladies,	1
the	1
curate	1
and	1
the	1
barber.	1
And	1
so	1
they	1
supped	1
in	1
high	1
enjoyment,	1
which	1
was	1
increased	1
when	1
they	1
observed	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
leave	1
off	1
eating,	1
and,	1
moved	1
by	1
an	1
impulse	1
like	1
that	1
which	1
made	1
him	1
deliver	1
himself	1
at	1
such	1
length	1
when	1
he	1
supped	1
with	1
the	1
goatherds,	1
begin	1
to	1
address	1
them:	1
“Verily,	1
gentlemen,	1
if	1
we	1
reflect	1
upon	1
it,	1
great	1
and	1
marvellous	1
are	1
the	1
things	1
they	1
see,	1
who	1
make	1
profession	1
of	1
the	1
order	1
of	1
knight-errantry.	1
Say,	1
what	1
being	1
is	1
there	1
in	1
this	1
world,	1
who	1
entering	1
the	1
gate	1
of	1
this	1
castle	1
at	1
this	1
moment,	1
and	1
seeing	1
us	1
as	1
we	1
are	1
here,	1
would	1
suppose	1
or	1
imagine	1
us	1
to	1
be	1
what	1
we	1
are?	1
Who	1
would	1
say	1
that	1
this	1
lady	1
who	1
is	1
beside	1
me	1
was	1
the	1
great	1
queen	1
that	1
we	1
all	1
know	1
her	1
to	1
be,	1
or	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
that	1
Knight	1
of	1
the	1
Rueful	1
Countenance,	1
trumpeted	1
far	1
and	1
wide	1
by	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
Fame?	1
Now,	1
there	1
can	1
be	1
no	1
doubt	1
that	1
this	1
art	1
and	1
calling	1
surpasses	1
all	1
those	1
that	1
mankind	1
has	1
invented,	1
and	1
is	1
the	1
more	1
deserving	1
of	1
being	1
held	1
in	1
honour	1
in	1
proportion	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
more	1
exposed	1
to	1
peril.	1
Away	1
with	1
those	1
who	1
assert	1
that	1
letters	1
have	1
the	1
preeminence	1
over	1
arms;	1
I	1
will	1
tell	1
them,	1
whosoever	1
they	1
may	1
be,	1
that	1
they	1
know	1
not	1
what	1
they	1
say.	1
For	1
the	1
reason	1
which	1
such	1
persons	1
commonly	1
assign,	1
and	1
upon	1
which	1
they	1
chiefly	1
rest,	1
is,	1
that	1
the	1
labours	1
of	1
the	1
mind	1
are	1
greater	1
than	1
those	1
of	1
the	1
body,	1
and	1
that	1
arms	1
give	1
employment	1
to	1
the	1
body	1
alone;	1
as	1
if	1
the	1
calling	1
were	1
a	1
porter’s	1
trade,	1
for	1
which	1
nothing	1
more	1
is	1
required	1
than	1
sturdy	1
strength;	1
or	1
as	1
if,	1
in	1
what	1
we	1
who	1
profess	1
them	1
call	1
arms,	1
there	1
were	1
not	1
included	1
acts	1
of	1
vigour	1
for	1
the	1
execution	1
of	1
which	1
high	1
intelligence	1
is	1
requisite;	1
or	1
as	1
if	1
the	1
soul	1
of	1
the	1
warrior,	1
when	1
he	1
has	1
an	1
army,	1
or	1
the	1
defence	1
of	1
a	1
city	1
under	1
his	1
care,	1
did	1
not	1
exert	1
itself	1
as	1
much	1
by	1
mind	1
as	1
by	1
body.	1
Nay;	1
see	1
whether	1
by	1
bodily	1
strength	1
it	1
be	1
possible	1
to	1
learn	1
or	1
divine	1
the	1
intentions	1
of	1
the	1
enemy,	1
his	1
plans,	1
stratagems,	1
or	1
obstacles,	1
or	1
to	1
ward	1
off	1
impending	1
mischief;	1
for	1
all	1
these	1
are	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
the	1
mind,	1
and	1
in	1
them	1
the	1
body	1
has	1
no	1
share	1
whatever.	1
Since,	1
therefore,	1
arms	1
have	1
need	1
of	1
the	1
mind,	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
letters,	1
let	1
us	1
see	1
now	1
which	1
of	1
the	1
two	1
minds,	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
man	1
of	1
letters	1
or	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
warrior,	1
has	1
most	1
to	1
do;	1
and	1
this	1
will	1
be	1
seen	1
by	1
the	1
end	1
and	1
goal	1
that	1
each	1
seeks	1
to	1
attain;	1
for	1
that	1
purpose	1
is	1
the	1
more	1
estimable	1
which	1
has	1
for	1
its	1
aim	1
the	1
nobler	1
object.	1
The	1
end	1
and	1
goal	1
of	1
letters—I	1
am	1
not	1
speaking	1
now	1
of	1
divine	1
letters,	1
the	1
aim	1
of	1
which	1
is	1
to	1
raise	1
and	1
direct	1
the	1
soul	1
to	1
Heaven;	1
for	1
with	1
an	1
end	1
so	1
infinite	1
no	1
other	1
can	1
be	1
compared—I	1
speak	1
of	1
human	1
letters,	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
which	1
is	1
to	1
establish	1
distributive	1
justice,	1
give	1
to	1
every	1
man	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
his,	1
and	1
see	1
and	1
take	1
care	1
that	1
good	1
laws	1
are	1
observed:	1
an	1
end	1
undoubtedly	1
noble,	1
lofty,	1
and	1
deserving	1
of	1
high	1
praise,	1
but	1
not	1
such	1
as	1
should	1
be	1
given	1
to	1
that	1
sought	1
by	1
arms,	1
which	1
have	1
for	1
their	1
end	1
and	1
object	1
peace,	1
the	1
greatest	1
boon	1
that	1
men	1
can	1
desire	1
in	1
this	1
life.	1
The	1
first	1
good	1
news	1
the	1
world	1
and	1
mankind	1
received	1
was	1
that	1
which	1
the	1
angels	1
announced	1
on	1
the	1
night	1
that	1
was	1
our	1
day,	1
when	1
they	1
sang	1
in	1
the	1
air,	1
‘Glory	1
to	1
God	1
in	1
the	1
highest,	1
and	1
peace	1
on	1
earth	1
to	1
men	1
of	1
good-will;’	1
and	1
the	1
salutation	1
which	1
the	1
great	1
Master	1
of	1
heaven	1
and	1
earth	1
taught	1
his	1
disciples	1
and	1
chosen	1
followers	1
when	1
they	1
entered	1
any	1
house,	1
was	1
to	1
say,	1
‘Peace	1
be	1
on	1
this	1
house;’	1
and	1
many	1
other	1
times	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
them,	1
‘My	1
peace	1
I	1
give	1
unto	1
you,	1
my	1
peace	1
I	1
leave	1
you,	1
peace	1
be	1
with	1
you;’	1
a	1
jewel	1
and	1
a	1
precious	1
gift	1
given	1
and	1
left	1
by	1
such	1
a	1
hand:	1
a	1
jewel	1
without	1
which	1
there	1
can	1
be	1
no	1
happiness	1
either	1
on	1
earth	1
or	1
in	1
heaven.	1
This	1
peace	1
is	1
the	1
true	1
end	1
of	1
war;	1
and	1
war	1
is	1
only	1
another	1
name	1
for	1
arms.	1
This,	1
then,	1
being	1
admitted,	1
that	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
war	1
is	1
peace,	1
and	1
that	1
so	1
far	1
it	1
has	1
the	1
advantage	1
of	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
letters,	1
let	1
us	1
turn	1
to	1
the	1
bodily	1
labours	1
of	1
the	1
man	1
of	1
letters,	1
and	1
those	1
of	1
him	1
who	1
follows	1
the	1
profession	1
of	1
arms,	1
and	1
see	1
which	1
are	1
the	1
greater.”	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
delivered	1
his	1
discourse	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
manner	1
and	1
in	1
such	1
correct	1
language,	1
that	1
for	1
the	1
time	1
being	1
he	1
made	1
it	1
impossible	1
for	1
any	1
of	1
his	1
hearers	1
to	1
consider	1
him	1
a	1
madman;	1
on	1
the	1
contrary,	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
mostly	1
gentlemen,	1
to	1
whom	1
arms	1
are	1
an	1
appurtenance	1
by	1
birth,	1
they	1
listened	1
to	1
him	1
with	1
great	1
pleasure	1
as	1
he	1
continued:	1
“Here,	1
then,	1
I	1
say	1
is	1
what	1
the	1
student	1
has	1
to	1
undergo;	1
first	1
of	1
all	1
poverty:	1
not	1
that	1
all	1
are	1
poor,	1
but	1
to	1
put	1
the	1
case	1
as	1
strongly	1
as	1
possible:	1
and	1
when	1
I	1
have	1
said	1
that	1
he	1
endures	1
poverty,	1
I	1
think	1
nothing	1
more	1
need	1
be	1
said	1
about	1
his	1
hard	1
fortune,	1
for	1
he	1
who	1
is	1
poor	1
has	1
no	1
share	1
of	1
the	1
good	1
things	1
of	1
life.	1
This	1
poverty	1
he	1
suffers	1
from	1
in	1
various	1
ways,	1
hunger,	1
or	1
cold,	1
or	1
nakedness,	1
or	1
all	1
together;	1
but	1
for	1
all	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
so	1
extreme	1
but	1
that	1
he	1
gets	1
something	1
to	1
eat,	1
though	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
at	1
somewhat	1
unseasonable	1
hours	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
leavings	1
of	1
the	1
rich;	1
for	1
the	1
greatest	1
misery	1
of	1
the	1
student	1
is	1
what	1
they	1
themselves	1
call	1
‘going	1
out	1
for	1
soup,’	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
always	1
some	1
neighbour’s	1
brazier	1
or	1
hearth	1
for	1
them,	1
which,	1
if	1
it	1
does	1
not	1
warm,	1
at	1
least	1
tempers	1
the	1
cold	1
to	1
them,	1
and	1
lastly,	1
they	1
sleep	1
comfortably	1
at	1
night	1
under	1
a	1
roof.	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
go	1
into	1
other	1
particulars,	1
as	1
for	1
example	1
want	1
of	1
shirts,	1
and	1
no	1
superabundance	1
of	1
shoes,	1
thin	1
and	1
threadbare	1
garments,	1
and	1
gorging	1
themselves	1
to	1
surfeit	1
in	1
their	1
voracity	1
when	1
good	1
luck	1
has	1
treated	1
them	1
to	1
a	1
banquet	1
of	1
some	1
sort.	1
By	1
this	1
road	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
described,	1
rough	1
and	1
hard,	1
stumbling	1
here,	1
falling	1
there,	1
getting	1
up	1
again	1
to	1
fall	1
again,	1
they	1
reach	1
the	1
rank	1
they	1
desire,	1
and	1
that	1
once	1
attained,	1
we	1
have	1
seen	1
many	1
who	1
have	1
passed	1
these	1
Syrtes	1
and	1
Scyllas	1
and	1
Charybdises,	1
as	1
if	1
borne	1
flying	1
on	1
the	1
wings	1
of	1
favouring	1
fortune;	1
we	1
have	1
seen	1
them,	1
I	1
say,	1
ruling	1
and	1
governing	1
the	1
world	1
from	1
a	1
chair,	1
their	1
hunger	1
turned	1
into	1
satiety,	1
their	1
cold	1
into	1
comfort,	1
their	1
nakedness	1
into	1
fine	1
raiment,	1
their	1
sleep	1
on	1
a	1
mat	1
into	1
repose	1
in	1
holland	1
and	1
damask,	1
the	1
justly	1
earned	1
reward	1
of	1
their	1
virtue;	1
but,	1
contrasted	1
and	1
compared	1
with	1
what	1
the	1
warrior	1
undergoes,	1
all	1
they	1
have	1
undergone	1
falls	1
far	1
short	1
of	1
it,	1
as	1
I	1
am	1
now	1
about	1
to	1
show.”	1

Continuing	1
his	1
discourse	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
said:	1
“As	1
we	1
began	1
in	1
the	1
student’s	1
case	1
with	1
poverty	1
and	1
its	1
accompaniments,	1
let	1
us	1
see	1
now	1
if	1
the	1
soldier	1
is	1
richer,	1
and	1
we	1
shall	1
find	1
that	1
in	1
poverty	1
itself	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
one	1
poorer;	1
for	1
he	1
is	1
dependent	1
on	1
his	1
miserable	1
pay,	1
which	1
comes	1
late	1
or	1
never,	1
or	1
else	1
on	1
what	1
he	1
can	1
plunder,	1
seriously	1
imperilling	1
his	1
life	1
and	1
conscience;	1
and	1
sometimes	1
his	1
nakedness	1
will	1
be	1
so	1
great	1
that	1
a	1
slashed	1
doublet	1
serves	1
him	1
for	1
uniform	1
and	1
shirt,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
depth	1
of	1
winter	1
he	1
has	1
to	1
defend	1
himself	1
against	1
the	1
inclemency	1
of	1
the	1
weather	1
in	1
the	1
open	1
field	1
with	1
nothing	1
better	1
than	1
the	1
breath	1
of	1
his	1
mouth,	1
which	1
I	1
need	1
not	1
say,	1
coming	1
from	1
an	1
empty	1
place,	1
must	1
come	1
out	1
cold,	1
contrary	1
to	1
the	1
laws	1
of	1
nature.	1
To	1
be	1
sure	1
he	1
looks	1
forward	1
to	1
the	1
approach	1
of	1
night	1
to	1
make	1
up	1
for	1
all	1
these	1
discomforts	1
on	1
the	1
bed	1
that	1
awaits	1
him,	1
which,	1
unless	1
by	1
some	1
fault	1
of	1
his,	1
never	1
sins	1
by	1
being	1
over	1
narrow,	1
for	1
he	1
can	1
easily	1
measure	1
out	1
on	1
the	1
ground	1
as	1
he	1
likes,	1
and	1
roll	1
himself	1
about	1
in	1
it	1
to	1
his	1
heart’s	1
content	1
without	1
any	1
fear	1
of	1
the	1
sheets	1
slipping	1
away	1
from	1
him.	1
Then,	1
after	1
all	1
this,	1
suppose	1
the	1
day	1
and	1
hour	1
for	1
taking	1
his	1
degree	1
in	1
his	1
calling	1
to	1
have	1
come;	1
suppose	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
battle	1
to	1
have	1
arrived,	1
when	1
they	1
invest	1
him	1
with	1
the	1
doctor’s	1
cap	1
made	1
of	1
lint,	1
to	1
mend	1
some	1
bullet-hole,	1
perhaps,	1
that	1
has	1
gone	1
through	1
his	1
temples,	1
or	1
left	1
him	1
with	1
a	1
crippled	1
arm	1
or	1
leg.	1
Or	1
if	1
this	1
does	1
not	1
happen,	1
and	1
merciful	1
Heaven	1
watches	1
over	1
him	1
and	1
keeps	1
him	1
safe	1
and	1
sound,	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
he	1
will	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
poverty	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
before,	1
and	1
he	1
must	1
go	1
through	1
more	1
engagements	1
and	1
more	1
battles,	1
and	1
come	1
victorious	1
out	1
of	1
all	1
before	1
he	1
betters	1
himself;	1
but	1
miracles	1
of	1
that	1
sort	1
are	1
seldom	1
seen.	1
For	1
tell	1
me,	1
sirs,	1
if	1
you	1
have	1
ever	1
reflected	1
upon	1
it,	1
by	1
how	1
much	1
do	1
those	1
who	1
have	1
gained	1
by	1
war	1
fall	1
short	1
of	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
have	1
perished	1
in	1
it?	1
No	1
doubt	1
you	1
will	1
reply	1
that	1
there	1
can	1
be	1
no	1
comparison,	1
that	1
the	1
dead	1
cannot	1
be	1
numbered,	1
while	1
the	1
living	1
who	1
have	1
been	1
rewarded	1
may	1
be	1
summed	1
up	1
with	1
three	1
figures.	1
All	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
reverse	1
in	1
the	1
case	1
of	1
men	1
of	1
letters;	1
for	1
by	1
skirts,	1
to	1
say	1
nothing	1
of	1
sleeves,	1
they	1
all	1
find	1
means	1
of	1
support;	1
so	1
that	1
though	1
the	1
soldier	1
has	1
more	1
to	1
endure,	1
his	1
reward	1
is	1
much	1
less.	1
But	1
against	1
all	1
this	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
urged	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
easier	1
to	1
reward	1
two	1
thousand	1
soldiers,	1
for	1
the	1
former	1
may	1
be	1
remunerated	1
by	1
giving	1
them	1
places,	1
which	1
must	1
perforce	1
be	1
conferred	1
upon	1
men	1
of	1
their	1
calling,	1
while	1
the	1
latter	1
can	1
only	1
be	1
recompensed	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
very	1
property	1
of	1
the	1
master	1
they	1
serve;	1
but	1
this	1
impossibility	1
only	1
strengthens	1
my	1
argument.	1
“Putting	1
this,	1
however,	1
aside,	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
puzzling	1
question	1
for	1
which	1
it	1
is	1
difficult	1
to	1
find	1
a	1
solution,	1
let	1
us	1
return	1
to	1
the	1
superiority	1
of	1
arms	1
over	1
letters,	1
a	1
matter	1
still	1
undecided,	1
so	1
many	1
are	1
the	1
arguments	1
put	1
forward	1
on	1
each	1
side;	1
for	1
besides	1
those	1
I	1
have	1
mentioned,	1
letters	1
say	1
that	1
without	1
them	1
arms	1
cannot	1
maintain	1
themselves,	1
for	1
war,	1
too,	1
has	1
its	1
laws	1
and	1
is	1
governed	1
by	1
them,	1
and	1
laws	1
belong	1
to	1
the	1
domain	1
of	1
letters	1
and	1
men	1
of	1
letters.	1
To	1
this	1
arms	1
make	1
answer	1
that	1
without	1
them	1
laws	1
cannot	1
be	1
maintained,	1
for	1
by	1
arms	1
states	1
are	1
defended,	1
kingdoms	1
preserved,	1
cities	1
protected,	1
roads	1
made	1
safe,	1
seas	1
cleared	1
of	1
pirates;	1
and,	1
in	1
short,	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
not	1
for	1
them,	1
states,	1
kingdoms,	1
monarchies,	1
cities,	1
ways	1
by	1
sea	1
and	1
land	1
would	1
be	1
exposed	1
to	1
the	1
violence	1
and	1
confusion	1
which	1
war	1
brings	1
with	1
it,	1
so	1
long	1
as	1
it	1
lasts	1
and	1
is	1
free	1
to	1
make	1
use	1
of	1
its	1
privileges	1
and	1
powers.	1
And	1
then	1
it	1
is	1
plain	1
that	1
whatever	1
costs	1
most	1
is	1
valued	1
and	1
deserves	1
to	1
be	1
valued	1
most.	1
To	1
attain	1
to	1
eminence	1
in	1
letters	1
costs	1
a	1
man	1
time,	1
watching,	1
hunger,	1
nakedness,	1
headaches,	1
indigestions,	1
and	1
other	1
things	1
of	1
the	1
sort,	1
some	1
of	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
already	1
referred	1
to.	1
But	1
for	1
a	1
man	1
to	1
come	1
in	1
the	1
ordinary	1
course	1
of	1
things	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
good	1
soldier	1
costs	1
him	1
all	1
the	1
student	1
suffers,	1
and	1
in	1
an	1
incomparably	1
higher	1
degree,	1
for	1
at	1
every	1
step	1
he	1
runs	1
the	1
risk	1
of	1
losing	1
his	1
life.	1
For	1
what	1
dread	1
of	1
want	1
or	1
poverty	1
that	1
can	1
reach	1
or	1
harass	1
the	1
student	1
can	1
compare	1
with	1
what	1
the	1
soldier	1
feels,	1
who	1
finds	1
himself	1
beleaguered	1
in	1
some	1
stronghold	1
mounting	1
guard	1
in	1
some	1
ravelin	1
or	1
cavalier,	1
knows	1
that	1
the	1
enemy	1
is	1
pushing	1
a	1
mine	1
towards	1
the	1
post	1
where	1
he	1
is	1
stationed,	1
and	1
cannot	1
under	1
any	1
circumstances	1
retire	1
or	1
fly	1
from	1
the	1
imminent	1
danger	1
that	1
threatens	1
him?	1
All	1
he	1
can	1
do	1
is	1
to	1
inform	1
his	1
captain	1
of	1
what	1
is	1
going	1
on	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
try	1
to	1
remedy	1
it	1
by	1
a	1
counter-mine,	1
and	1
then	1
stand	1
his	1
ground	1
in	1
fear	1
and	1
expectation	1
of	1
the	1
moment	1
when	1
he	1
will	1
fly	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
clouds	1
without	1
wings	1
and	1
descend	1
into	1
the	1
deep	1
against	1
his	1
will.	1
And	1
if	1
this	1
seems	1
a	1
trifling	1
risk,	1
let	1
us	1
see	1
whether	1
it	1
is	1
equalled	1
or	1
surpassed	1
by	1
the	1
encounter	1
of	1
two	1
galleys	1
stem	1
to	1
stem,	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
open	1
sea,	1
locked	1
and	1
entangled	1
one	1
with	1
the	1
other,	1
when	1
the	1
soldier	1
has	1
no	1
more	1
standing	1
room	1
than	1
two	1
feet	1
of	1
the	1
plank	1
of	1
the	1
spur;	1
and	1
yet,	1
though	1
he	1
sees	1
before	1
him	1
threatening	1
him	1
as	1
many	1
ministers	1
of	1
death	1
as	1
there	1
are	1
cannon	1
of	1
the	1
foe	1
pointed	1
at	1
him,	1
not	1
a	1
lance	1
length	1
from	1
his	1
body,	1
and	1
sees	1
too	1
that	1
with	1
the	1
first	1
heedless	1
step	1
he	1
will	1
go	1
down	1
to	1
visit	1
the	1
profundities	1
of	1
Neptune’s	1
bosom,	1
still	1
with	1
dauntless	1
heart,	1
urged	1
on	1
by	1
honour	1
that	1
nerves	1
him,	1
he	1
makes	1
himself	1
a	1
target	1
for	1
all	1
that	1
musketry,	1
and	1
struggles	1
to	1
cross	1
that	1
narrow	1
path	1
to	1
the	1
enemy’s	1
ship.	1
And	1
what	1
is	1
still	1
more	1
marvellous,	1
no	1
sooner	1
has	1
one	1
gone	1
down	1
into	1
the	1
depths	1
he	1
will	1
never	1
rise	1
from	1
till	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
world,	1
than	1
another	1
takes	1
his	1
place;	1
and	1
if	1
he	1
too	1
falls	1
into	1
the	1
sea	1
that	1
waits	1
for	1
him	1
like	1
an	1
enemy,	1
another	1
and	1
another	1
will	1
succeed	1
him	1
without	1
a	1
moment’s	1
pause	1
between	1
their	1
deaths:	1
courage	1
and	1
daring	1
the	1
greatest	1
that	1
all	1
the	1
chances	1
of	1
war	1
can	1
show.	1
Happy	1
the	1
blest	1
ages	1
that	1
knew	1
not	1
the	1
dread	1
fury	1
of	1
those	1
devilish	1
engines	1
of	1
artillery,	1
whose	1
inventor	1
I	1
am	1
persuaded	1
is	1
in	1
hell	1
receiving	1
the	1
reward	1
of	1
his	1
diabolical	1
invention,	1
by	1
which	1
he	1
made	1
it	1
easy	1
for	1
a	1
base	1
and	1
cowardly	1
arm	1
to	1
take	1
the	1
life	1
of	1
a	1
gallant	1
gentleman;	1
and	1
that,	1
when	1
he	1
knows	1
not	1
how	1
or	1
whence,	1
in	1
the	1
height	1
of	1
the	1
ardour	1
and	1
enthusiasm	1
that	1
fire	1
and	1
animate	1
brave	1
hearts,	1
there	1
should	1
come	1
some	1
random	1
bullet,	1
discharged	1
perhaps	1
by	1
one	1
who	1
fled	1
in	1
terror	1
at	1
the	1
flash	1
when	1
he	1
fired	1
off	1
his	1
accursed	1
machine,	1
which	1
in	1
an	1
instant	1
puts	1
an	1
end	1
to	1
the	1
projects	1
and	1
cuts	1
off	1
the	1
life	1
of	1
one	1
who	1
deserved	1
to	1
live	1
for	1
ages	1
to	1
come.	1
And	1
thus	1
when	1
I	1
reflect	1
on	1
this,	1
I	1
am	1
almost	1
tempted	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
in	1
my	1
heart	1
I	1
repent	1
of	1
having	1
adopted	1
this	1
profession	1
of	1
knight-errant	1
in	1
so	1
detestable	1
an	1
age	1
as	1
we	1
live	1
in	1
now;	1
for	1
though	1
no	1
peril	1
can	1
make	1
me	1
fear,	1
still	1
it	1
gives	1
me	1
some	1
uneasiness	1
to	1
think	1
that	1
powder	1
and	1
lead	1
may	1
rob	1
me	1
of	1
the	1
opportunity	1
of	1
making	1
myself	1
famous	1
and	1
renowned	1
throughout	1
the	1
known	1
earth	1
by	1
the	1
might	1
of	1
my	1
arm	1
and	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
my	1
sword.	1
But	1
Heaven’s	1
will	1
be	1
done;	1
if	1
I	1
succeed	1
in	1
my	1
attempt	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
all	1
the	1
more	1
honoured,	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
faced	1
greater	1
dangers	1
than	1
the	1
knights-errant	1
of	1
yore	1
exposed	1
themselves	1
to.”	1
All	1
this	1
lengthy	1
discourse	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
delivered	1
while	1
the	1
others	1
supped,	1
forgetting	1
to	1
raise	1
a	1
morsel	1
to	1
his	1
lips,	1
though	1
Sancho	1
more	1
than	1
once	1
told	1
him	1
to	1
eat	1
his	1
supper,	1
as	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
time	1
enough	1
afterwards	1
to	1
say	1
all	1
he	1
wanted.	1
It	1
excited	1
fresh	1
pity	1
in	1
those	1
who	1
had	1
heard	1
him	1
to	1
see	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
apparently	1
sound	1
sense,	1
and	1
with	1
rational	1
views	1
on	1
every	1
subject	1
he	1
discussed,	1
so	1
hopelessly	1
wanting	1
in	1
all,	1
when	1
his	1
wretched	1
unlucky	1
chivalry	1
was	1
in	1
question.	1
The	1
curate	1
told	1
him	1
he	1
was	1
quite	1
right	1
in	1
all	1
he	1
had	1
said	1
in	1
favour	1
of	1
arms,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
himself,	1
though	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
letters	1
and	1
a	1
graduate,	1
was	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
opinion.	1
They	1
finished	1
their	1
supper,	1
the	1
cloth	1
was	1
removed,	1
and	1
while	1
the	1
hostess,	1
her	1
daughter,	1
and	1
Maritornes	1
were	1
getting	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
of	1
La	1
Mancha’s	1
garret	1
ready,	1
in	1
which	1
it	1
was	1
arranged	1
that	1
the	1
women	1
were	1
to	1
be	1
quartered	1
by	1
themselves	1
for	1
the	1
night,	1
Don	1
Fernando	1
begged	1
the	1
captive	1
to	1
tell	1
them	1
the	1
story	1
of	1
his	1
life,	1
for	1
it	1
could	1
not	1
fail	1
to	1
be	1
strange	1
and	1
interesting,	1
to	1
judge	1
by	1
the	1
hints	1
he	1
had	1
let	1
fall	1
on	1
his	1
arrival	1
in	1
company	1
with	1
Zoraida.	1
To	1
this	1
the	1
captive	1
replied	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
very	1
willingly	1
yield	1
to	1
his	1
request,	1
only	1
he	1
feared	1
his	1
tale	1
would	1
not	1
give	1
them	1
as	1
much	1
pleasure	1
as	1
he	1
wished;	1
nevertheless,	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
wanting	1
in	1
compliance,	1
he	1
would	1
tell	1
it.	1
The	1
curate	1
and	1
the	1
others	1
thanked	1
him	1
and	1
added	1
their	1
entreaties,	1
and	1
he	1
finding	1
himself	1
so	1
pressed	1
said	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
occasion	1
ask,	1
where	1
a	1
command	1
had	1
such	1
weight,	1
and	1
added,	1
“If	1
your	1
worships	1
will	1
give	1
me	1
your	1
attention	1
you	1
will	1
hear	1
a	1
true	1
story	1
which,	1
perhaps,	1
fictitious	1
ones	1
constructed	1
with	1
ingenious	1
and	1
studied	1
art	1
cannot	1
come	1
up	1
to.”	1
These	1
words	1
made	1
them	1
settle	1
themselves	1
in	1
their	1
places	1
and	1
preserve	1
a	1
deep	1
silence,	1
and	1
he	1
seeing	1
them	1
waiting	1
on	1
his	1
words	1
in	1
mute	1
expectation,	1
began	1
thus	1
in	1
a	1
pleasant	1
quiet	1
voice.	1

WHEREIN	1
THE	1
CAPTIVE	1
RELATES	1
HIS	1
LIFE	1
AND	1
ADVENTURES	1
c39a.jpg	1
(137K)	1
Full	1
Size	1
My	1
family	1
had	1
its	1
origin	1
in	1
a	1
village	1
in	1
the	1
mountains	1
of	1
Leon,	1
and	1
nature	1
had	1
been	1
kinder	1
and	1
more	1
generous	1
to	1
it	1
than	1
fortune;	1
though	1
in	1
the	1
general	1
poverty	1
of	1
those	1
communities	1
my	1
father	1
passed	1
for	1
being	1
even	1
a	1
rich	1
man;	1
and	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
so	1
in	1
reality	1
had	1
he	1
been	1
as	1
clever	1
in	1
preserving	1
his	1
property	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
spending	1
it.	1
This	1
tendency	1
of	1
his	1
to	1
be	1
liberal	1
and	1
profuse	1
he	1
had	1
acquired	1
from	1
having	1
been	1
a	1
soldier	1
in	1
his	1
youth,	1
for	1
the	1
soldier’s	1
life	1
is	1
a	1
school	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
niggard	1
becomes	1
free-handed	1
and	1
the	1
free-handed	1
prodigal;	1
and	1
if	1
any	1
soldiers	1
are	1
to	1
be	1
found	1
who	1
are	1
misers,	1
they	1
are	1
monsters	1
of	1
rare	1
occurrence.	1
My	1
father	1
went	1
beyond	1
liberality	1
and	1
bordered	1
on	1
prodigality,	1
a	1
disposition	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
advantageous	1
to	1
a	1
married	1
man	1
who	1
has	1
children	1
to	1
succeed	1
to	1
his	1
name	1
and	1
position.	1
My	1
father	1
had	1
three,	1
all	1
sons,	1
and	1
all	1
of	1
sufficient	1
age	1
to	1
make	1
choice	1
of	1
a	1
profession.	1
Finding,	1
then,	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
unable	1
to	1
resist	1
his	1
propensity,	1
he	1
resolved	1
to	1
divest	1
himself	1
of	1
the	1
instrument	1
and	1
cause	1
of	1
his	1
prodigality	1
and	1
lavishness,	1
to	1
divest	1
himself	1
of	1
wealth,	1
without	1
which	1
Alexander	1
himself	1
would	1
have	1
seemed	1
parsimonious;	1
and	1
so	1
calling	1
us	1
all	1
three	1
aside	1
one	1
day	1
into	1
a	1
room,	1
he	1
addressed	1
us	1
in	1
words	1
somewhat	1
to	1
the	1
following	1
effect:	1
“My	1
sons,	1
to	1
assure	1
you	1
that	1
I	1
love	1
you,	1
no	1
more	1
need	1
be	1
known	1
or	1
said	1
than	1
that	1
you	1
are	1
my	1
sons;	1
and	1
to	1
encourage	1
a	1
suspicion	1
that	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
love	1
you,	1
no	1
more	1
is	1
needed	1
than	1
the	1
knowledge	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
self-control	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
preservation	1
of	1
your	1
patrimony	1
is	1
concerned;	1
therefore,	1
that	1
you	1
may	1
for	1
the	1
future	1
feel	1
sure	1
that	1
I	1
love	1
you	1
like	1
a	1
father,	1
and	1
have	1
no	1
wish	1
to	1
ruin	1
you	1
like	1
a	1
stepfather,	1
I	1
propose	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
you	1
what	1
I	1
have	1
for	1
some	1
time	1
back	1
meditated,	1
and	1
after	1
mature	1
deliberation	1
decided	1
upon.	1
You	1
are	1
now	1
of	1
an	1
age	1
to	1
choose	1
your	1
line	1
of	1
life	1
or	1
at	1
least	1
make	1
choice	1
of	1
a	1
calling	1
that	1
will	1
bring	1
you	1
honour	1
and	1
profit	1
when	1
you	1
are	1
older;	1
and	1
what	1
I	1
have	1
resolved	1
to	1
do	1
is	1
to	1
divide	1
my	1
property	1
into	1
four	1
parts;	1
three	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
to	1
you,	1
to	1
each	1
his	1
portion	1
without	1
making	1
any	1
difference,	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
I	1
will	1
retain	1
to	1
live	1
upon	1
and	1
support	1
myself	1
for	1
whatever	1
remainder	1
of	1
life	1
Heaven	1
may	1
be	1
pleased	1
to	1
grant	1
me.	1
But	1
I	1
wish	1
each	1
of	1
you	1
on	1
taking	1
possession	1
of	1
the	1
share	1
that	1
falls	1
to	1
him	1
to	1
follow	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
paths	1
I	1
shall	1
indicate.	1
In	1
this	1
Spain	1
of	1
ours	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
proverb,	1
to	1
my	1
mind	1
very	1
true—as	1
they	1
all	1
are,	1
being	1
short	1
aphorisms	1
drawn	1
from	1
long	1
practical	1
experience—and	1
the	1
one	1
I	1
refer	1
to	1
says,	1
‘The	1
church,	1
or	1
the	1
sea,	1
or	1
the	1
king’s	1
house;’	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
to	1
say,	1
in	1
plainer	1
language,	1
whoever	1
wants	1
to	1
flourish	1
and	1
become	1
rich,	1
let	1
him	1
follow	1
the	1
church,	1
or	1
go	1
to	1
sea,	1
adopting	1
commerce	1
as	1
his	1
calling,	1
or	1
go	1
into	1
the	1
king’s	1
service	1
in	1
his	1
household,	1
for	1
they	1
say,	1
‘Better	1
a	1
king’s	1
crumb	1
than	1
a	1
lord’s	1
favour.’	1
I	1
say	1
so	1
because	1
it	1
is	1
my	1
will	1
and	1
pleasure	1
that	1
one	1
of	1
you	1
should	1
follow	1
letters,	1
another	1
trade,	1
and	1
the	1
third	1
serve	1
the	1
king	1
in	1
the	1
wars,	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
difficult	1
matter	1
to	1
gain	1
admission	1
to	1
his	1
service	1
in	1
his	1
household,	1
and	1
if	1
war	1
does	1
not	1
bring	1
much	1
wealth	1
it	1
confers	1
great	1
distinction	1
and	1
fame.	1
Eight	1
days	1
hence	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
you	1
your	1
full	1
shares	1
in	1
money,	1
without	1
defrauding	1
you	1
of	1
a	1
farthing,	1
as	1
you	1
will	1
see	1
in	1
the	1
end.	1
Now	1
tell	1
me	1
if	1
you	1
are	1
willing	1
to	1
follow	1
out	1
my	1
idea	1
and	1
advice	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
laid	1
it	1
before	1
you.”	1
Having	1
called	1
upon	1
me	1
as	1
the	1
eldest	1
to	1
answer,	1
I,	1
after	1
urging	1
him	1
not	1
to	1
strip	1
himself	1
of	1
his	1
property	1
but	1
to	1
spend	1
it	1
all	1
as	1
he	1
pleased,	1
for	1
we	1
were	1
young	1
men	1
able	1
to	1
gain	1
our	1
living,	1
consented	1
to	1
comply	1
with	1
his	1
wishes,	1
and	1
said	1
that	1
mine	1
were	1
to	1
follow	1
the	1
profession	1
of	1
arms	1
and	1
thereby	1
serve	1
God	1
and	1
my	1
king.	1
My	1
second	1
brother	1
having	1
made	1
the	1
same	1
proposal,	1
decided	1
upon	1
going	1
to	1
the	1
Indies,	1
embarking	1
the	1
portion	1
that	1
fell	1
to	1
him	1
in	1
trade.	1
The	1
youngest,	1
and	1
in	1
my	1
opinion	1
the	1
wisest,	1
said	1
he	1
would	1
rather	1
follow	1
the	1
church,	1
or	1
go	1
to	1
complete	1
his	1
studies	1
at	1
Salamanca.	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
we	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
an	1
understanding,	1
and	1
made	1
choice	1
of	1
our	1
professions,	1
my	1
father	1
embraced	1
us	1
all,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
short	1
time	1
he	1
mentioned	1
carried	1
into	1
effect	1
all	1
he	1
had	1
promised;	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
given	1
to	1
each	1
his	1
share,	1
which	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
I	1
remember	1
was	1
three	1
thousand	1
ducats	1
apiece	1
in	1
cash	1
(for	1
an	1
uncle	1
of	1
ours	1
bought	1
the	1
estate	1
and	1
paid	1
for	1
it	1
down,	1
not	1
to	1
let	1
it	1
go	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
family),	1
we	1
all	1
three	1
on	1
the	1
same	1
day	1
took	1
leave	1
of	1
our	1
good	1
father;	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time,	1
as	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
me	1
inhuman	1
to	1
leave	1
my	1
father	1
with	1
such	1
scanty	1
means	1
in	1
his	1
old	1
age,	1
I	1
induced	1
him	1
to	1
take	1
two	1
of	1
my	1
three	1
thousand	1
ducats,	1
as	1
the	1
remainder	1
would	1
be	1
enough	1
to	1
provide	1
me	1
with	1
all	1
a	1
soldier	1
needed.	1
My	1
two	1
brothers,	1
moved	1
by	1
my	1
example,	1
gave	1
him	1
each	1
a	1
thousand	1
ducats,	1
so	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
left	1
for	1
my	1
father	1
four	1
thousand	1
ducats	1
in	1
money,	1
besides	1
three	1
thousand,	1
the	1
value	1
of	1
the	1
portion	1
that	1
fell	1
to	1
him	1
which	1
he	1
preferred	1
to	1
retain	1
in	1
land	1
instead	1
of	1
selling	1
it.	1
Finally,	1
as	1
I	1
said,	1
we	1
took	1
leave	1
of	1
him,	1
and	1
of	1
our	1
uncle	1
whom	1
I	1
have	1
mentioned,	1
not	1
without	1
sorrow	1
and	1
tears	1
on	1
both	1
sides,	1
they	1
charging	1
us	1
to	1
let	1
them	1
know	1
whenever	1
an	1
opportunity	1
offered	1
how	1
we	1
fared,	1
whether	1
well	1
or	1
ill.	1
We	1
promised	1
to	1
do	1
so,	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
embraced	1
us	1
and	1
given	1
us	1
his	1
blessing,	1
one	1
set	1
out	1
for	1
Salamanca,	1
the	1
other	1
for	1
Seville,	1
and	1
I	1
for	1
Alicante,	1
where	1
I	1
had	1
heard	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
Genoese	1
vessel	1
taking	1
in	1
a	1
cargo	1
of	1
wool	1
for	1
Genoa.	1
It	1
is	1
now	1
some	1
twenty-two	1
years	1
since	1
I	1
left	1
my	1
father’s	1
house,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
time,	1
though	1
I	1
have	1
written	1
several	1
letters,	1
I	1
have	1
had	1
no	1
news	1
whatever	1
of	1
him	1
or	1
of	1
my	1
brothers;	1
my	1
own	1
adventures	1
during	1
that	1
period	1
I	1
will	1
now	1
relate	1
briefly.	1
I	1
embarked	1
at	1
Alicante,	1
reached	1
Genoa	1
after	1
a	1
prosperous	1
voyage,	1
and	1
proceeded	1
thence	1
to	1
Milan,	1
where	1
I	1
provided	1
myself	1
with	1
arms	1
and	1
a	1
few	1
soldier’s	1
accoutrements;	1
thence	1
it	1
was	1
my	1
intention	1
to	1
go	1
and	1
take	1
service	1
in	1
Piedmont,	1
but	1
as	1
I	1
was	1
already	1
on	1
the	1
road	1
to	1
Alessandria	1
della	1
Paglia,	1
I	1
learned	1
that	1
the	1
great	1
Duke	1
of	1
Alva	1
was	1
on	1
his	1
way	1
to	1
Flanders.	1
I	1
changed	1
my	1
plans,	1
joined	1
him,	1
served	1
under	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
campaigns	1
he	1
made,	1
was	1
present	1
at	1
the	1
deaths	1
of	1
the	1
Counts	1
Egmont	1
and	1
Horn,	1
and	1
was	1
promoted	1
to	1
be	1
ensign	1
under	1
a	1
famous	1
captain	1
of	1
Guadalajara,	1
Diego	1
de	1
Urbina	1
by	1
name.	1
Some	1
time	1
after	1
my	1
arrival	1
in	1
Flanders	1
news	1
came	1
of	1
the	1
league	1
that	1
his	1
Holiness	1
Pope	1
Pius	1
V.	1
of	1
happy	1
memory,	1
had	1
made	1
with	1
Venice	1
and	1
Spain	1
against	1
the	1
common	1
enemy,	1
the	1
Turk,	1
who	1
had	1
just	1
then	1
with	1
his	1
fleet	1
taken	1
the	1
famous	1
island	1
of	1
Cyprus,	1
which	1
belonged	1
to	1
the	1
Venetians,	1
a	1
loss	1
deplorable	1
and	1
disastrous.	1
It	1
was	1
known	1
as	1
a	1
fact	1
that	1
the	1
Most	1
Serene	1
Don	1
John	1
of	1
Austria,	1
natural	1
brother	1
of	1
our	1
good	1
king	1
Don	1
Philip,	1
was	1
coming	1
as	1
commander-in-chief	1
of	1
the	1
allied	1
forces,	1
and	1
rumours	1
were	1
abroad	1
of	1
the	1
vast	1
warlike	1
preparations	1
which	1
were	1
being	1
made,	1
all	1
which	1
stirred	1
my	1
heart	1
and	1
filled	1
me	1
with	1
a	1
longing	1
to	1
take	1
part	1
in	1
the	1
campaign	1
which	1
was	1
expected;	1
and	1
though	1
I	1
had	1
reason	1
to	1
believe,	1
and	1
almost	1
certain	1
promises,	1
that	1
on	1
the	1
first	1
opportunity	1
that	1
presented	1
itself	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
promoted	1
to	1
be	1
captain,	1
I	1
preferred	1
to	1
leave	1
all	1
and	1
betake	1
myself,	1
as	1
I	1
did,	1
to	1
Italy;	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
my	1
good	1
fortune	1
that	1
Don	1
John	1
had	1
just	1
arrived	1
at	1
Genoa,	1
and	1
was	1
going	1
on	1
to	1
Naples	1
to	1
join	1
the	1
Venetian	1
fleet,	1
as	1
he	1
afterwards	1
did	1
at	1
Messina.	1
I	1
may	1
say,	1
in	1
short,	1
that	1
I	1
took	1
part	1
in	1
that	1
glorious	1
expedition,	1
promoted	1
by	1
this	1
time	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
captain	1
of	1
infantry,	1
to	1
which	1
honourable	1
charge	1
my	1
good	1
luck	1
rather	1
than	1
my	1
merits	1
raised	1
me;	1
and	1
that	1
day—so	1
fortunate	1
for	1
Christendom,	1
because	1
then	1
all	1
the	1
nations	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
were	1
disabused	1
of	1
the	1
error	1
under	1
which	1
they	1
lay	1
in	1
imagining	1
the	1
Turks	1
to	1
be	1
invincible	1
on	1
sea—on	1
that	1
day,	1
I	1
say,	1
on	1
which	1
the	1
Ottoman	1
pride	1
and	1
arrogance	1
were	1
broken,	1
among	1
all	1
that	1
were	1
there	1
made	1
happy	1
(for	1
the	1
Christians	1
who	1
died	1
that	1
day	1
were	1
happier	1
than	1
those	1
who	1
remained	1
alive	1
and	1
victorious)	1
I	1
alone	1
was	1
miserable;	1
for,	1
instead	1
of	1
some	1
naval	1
crown	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
have	1
expected	1
had	1
it	1
been	1
in	1
Roman	1
times,	1
on	1
the	1
night	1
that	1
followed	1
that	1
famous	1
day	1
I	1
found	1
myself	1
with	1
fetters	1
on	1
my	1
feet	1
and	1
manacles	1
on	1
my	1
hands.	1
It	1
happened	1
in	1
this	1
way:	1
El	1
Uchali,	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
Algiers,	1
a	1
daring	1
and	1
successful	1
corsair,	1
having	1
attacked	1
and	1
taken	1
the	1
leading	1
Maltese	1
galley	1
(only	1
three	1
knights	1
being	1
left	1
alive	1
in	1
it,	1
and	1
they	1
badly	1
wounded),	1
the	1
chief	1
galley	1
of	1
John	1
Andrea,	1
on	1
board	1
of	1
which	1
I	1
and	1
my	1
company	1
were	1
placed,	1
came	1
to	1
its	1
relief,	1
and	1
doing	1
as	1
was	1
bound	1
to	1
do	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
case,	1
I	1
leaped	1
on	1
board	1
the	1
enemy’s	1
galley,	1
which,	1
sheering	1
off	1
from	1
that	1
which	1
had	1
attacked	1
it,	1
prevented	1
my	1
men	1
from	1
following	1
me,	1
and	1
so	1
I	1
found	1
myself	1
alone	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
my	1
enemies,	1
who	1
were	1
in	1
such	1
numbers	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
unable	1
to	1
resist;	1
in	1
short	1
I	1
was	1
taken,	1
covered	1
with	1
wounds;	1
El	1
Uchali,	1
as	1
you	1
know,	1
sirs,	1
made	1
his	1
escape	1
with	1
his	1
entire	1
squadron,	1
and	1
I	1
was	1
left	1
a	1
prisoner	1
in	1
his	1
power,	1
the	1
only	1
sad	1
being	1
among	1
so	1
many	1
filled	1
with	1
joy,	1
and	1
the	1
only	1
captive	1
among	1
so	1
many	1
free;	1
for	1
there	1
were	1
fifteen	1
thousand	1
Christians,	1
all	1
at	1
the	1
oar	1
in	1
the	1
Turkish	1
fleet,	1
that	1
regained	1
their	1
longed-for	1
liberty	1
that	1
day.	1
They	1
carried	1
me	1
to	1
Constantinople,	1
where	1
the	1
Grand	1
Turk,	1
Selim,	1
made	1
my	1
master	1
general	1
at	1
sea	1
for	1
having	1
done	1
his	1
duty	1
in	1
the	1
battle	1
and	1
carried	1
off	1
as	1
evidence	1
of	1
his	1
bravery	1
the	1
standard	1
of	1
the	1
Order	1
of	1
Malta.	1
The	1
following	1
year,	1
which	1
was	1
the	1
year	1
seventy-two,	1
I	1
found	1
myself	1
at	1
Navarino	1
rowing	1
in	1
the	1
leading	1
galley	1
with	1
the	1
three	1
lanterns.	1
There	1
I	1
saw	1
and	1
observed	1
how	1
the	1
opportunity	1
of	1
capturing	1
the	1
whole	1
Turkish	1
fleet	1
in	1
harbour	1
was	1
lost;	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
marines	1
and	1
janizzaries	1
that	1
belonged	1
to	1
it	1
made	1
sure	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
about	1
to	1
be	1
attacked	1
inside	1
the	1
very	1
harbour,	1
and	1
had	1
their	1
kits	1
and	1
pasamaques,	1
or	1
shoes,	1
ready	1
to	1
flee	1
at	1
once	1
on	1
shore	1
without	1
waiting	1
to	1
be	1
assailed,	1
in	1
so	1
great	1
fear	1
did	1
they	1
stand	1
of	1
our	1
fleet.	1
But	1
Heaven	1
ordered	1
it	1
otherwise,	1
not	1
for	1
any	1
fault	1
or	1
neglect	1
of	1
the	1
general	1
who	1
commanded	1
on	1
our	1
side,	1
but	1
for	1
the	1
sins	1
of	1
Christendom,	1
and	1
because	1
it	1
was	1
God’s	1
will	1
and	1
pleasure	1
that	1
we	1
should	1
always	1
have	1
instruments	1
of	1
punishment	1
to	1
chastise	1
us.	1
As	1
it	1
was,	1
El	1
Uchali	1
took	1
refuge	1
at	1
Modon,	1
which	1
is	1
an	1
island	1
near	1
Navarino,	1
and	1
landing	1
forces	1
fortified	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
the	1
harbour	1
and	1
waited	1
quietly	1
until	1
Don	1
John	1
retired.	1
On	1
this	1
expedition	1
was	1
taken	1
the	1
galley	1
called	1
the	1
Prize,	1
whose	1
captain	1
was	1
a	1
son	1
of	1
the	1
famous	1
corsair	1
Barbarossa.	1
It	1
was	1
taken	1
by	1
the	1
chief	1
Neapolitan	1
galley	1
called	1
the	1
She-wolf,	1
commanded	1
by	1
that	1
thunderbolt	1
of	1
war,	1
that	1
father	1
of	1
his	1
men,	1
that	1
successful	1
and	1
unconquered	1
captain	1
Don	1
Álvaro	1
de	1
Bazan,	1
Marquis	1
of	1
Santa	1
Cruz;	1
and	1
I	1
cannot	1
help	1
telling	1
you	1
what	1
took	1
place	1
at	1
the	1
capture	1
of	1
the	1
Prize.	1
The	1
son	1
of	1
Barbarossa	1
was	1
so	1
cruel,	1
and	1
treated	1
his	1
slaves	1
so	1
badly,	1
that,	1
when	1
those	1
who	1
were	1
at	1
the	1
oars	1
saw	1
that	1
the	1
She-wolf	1
galley	1
was	1
bearing	1
down	1
upon	1
them	1
and	1
gaining	1
upon	1
them,	1
they	1
all	1
at	1
once	1
dropped	1
their	1
oars	1
and	1
seized	1
their	1
captain	1
who	1
stood	1
on	1
the	1
stage	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
gangway	1
shouting	1
to	1
them	1
to	1
row	1
lustily;	1
and	1
passing	1
him	1
on	1
from	1
bench	1
to	1
bench,	1
from	1
the	1
poop	1
to	1
the	1
prow,	1
they	1
so	1
bit	1
him	1
that	1
before	1
he	1
had	1
got	1
much	1
past	1
the	1
mast	1
his	1
soul	1
had	1
already	1
got	1
to	1
hell;	1
so	1
great,	1
as	1
I	1
said,	1
was	1
the	1
cruelty	1
with	1
which	1
he	1
treated	1
them,	1
and	1
the	1
hatred	1
with	1
which	1
they	1
hated	1
him.	1
We	1
returned	1
to	1
Constantinople,	1
and	1
the	1
following	1
year,	1
seventy-three,	1
it	1
became	1
known	1
that	1
Don	1
John	1
had	1
seized	1
Tunis	1
and	1
taken	1
the	1
kingdom	1
from	1
the	1
Turks,	1
and	1
placed	1
Muley	1
Hamet	1
in	1
possession,	1
putting	1
an	1
end	1
to	1
the	1
hopes	1
which	1
Muley	1
Hamida,	1
the	1
cruelest	1
and	1
bravest	1
Moor	1
in	1
the	1
world,	1
entertained	1
of	1
returning	1
to	1
reign	1
there.	1
The	1
Grand	1
Turk	1
took	1
the	1
loss	1
greatly	1
to	1
heart,	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
cunning	1
which	1
all	1
his	1
race	1
possess,	1
he	1
made	1
peace	1
with	1
the	1
Venetians	1
(who	1
were	1
much	1
more	1
eager	1
for	1
it	1
than	1
he	1
was),	1
and	1
the	1
following	1
year,	1
seventy-four,	1
he	1
attacked	1
the	1
Goletta	1
and	1
the	1
fort	1
which	1
Don	1
John	1
had	1
left	1
half	1
built	1
near	1
Tunis.	1
While	1
all	1
these	1
events	1
were	1
occurring,	1
I	1
was	1
labouring	1
at	1
the	1
oar	1
without	1
any	1
hope	1
of	1
freedom;	1
at	1
least	1
I	1
had	1
no	1
hope	1
of	1
obtaining	1
it	1
by	1
ransom,	1
for	1
I	1
was	1
firmly	1
resolved	1
not	1
to	1
write	1
to	1
my	1
father	1
telling	1
him	1
of	1
my	1
misfortunes.	1
At	1
length	1
the	1
Goletta	1
fell,	1
and	1
the	1
fort	1
fell,	1
before	1
which	1
places	1
there	1
were	1
seventy-five	1
thousand	1
regular	1
Turkish	1
soldiers,	1
and	1
more	1
than	1
four	1
hundred	1
thousand	1
Moors	1
and	1
Arabs	1
from	1
all	1
parts	1
of	1
Africa,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
train	1
of	1
all	1
this	1
great	1
host	1
such	1
munitions	1
and	1
engines	1
of	1
war,	1
and	1
so	1
many	1
pioneers	1
that	1
with	1
their	1
hands	1
they	1
might	1
have	1
covered	1
the	1
Goletta	1
and	1
the	1
fort	1
with	1
handfuls	1
of	1
earth.	1
The	1
first	1
to	1
fall	1
was	1
the	1
Goletta,	1
until	1
then	1
reckoned	1
impregnable,	1
and	1
it	1
fell,	1
not	1
by	1
any	1
fault	1
of	1
its	1
defenders,	1
who	1
did	1
all	1
that	1
they	1
could	1
and	1
should	1
have	1
done,	1
but	1
because	1
experiment	1
proved	1
how	1
easily	1
entrenchments	1
could	1
be	1
made	1
in	1
the	1
desert	1
sand	1
there;	1
for	1
water	1
used	1
to	1
be	1
found	1
at	1
two	1
palms	1
depth,	1
while	1
the	1
Turks	1
found	1
none	1
at	1
two	1
yards;	1
and	1
so	1
by	1
means	1
of	1
a	1
quantity	1
of	1
sandbags	1
they	1
raised	1
their	1
works	1
so	1
high	1
that	1
they	1
commanded	1
the	1
walls	1
of	1
the	1
fort,	1
sweeping	1
them	1
as	1
if	1
from	1
a	1
cavalier,	1
so	1
that	1
no	1
one	1
was	1
able	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
stand	1
or	1
maintain	1
the	1
defence.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
common	1
opinion	1
that	1
our	1
men	1
should	1
not	1
have	1
shut	1
themselves	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
Goletta,	1
but	1
should	1
have	1
waited	1
in	1
the	1
open	1
at	1
the	1
landing-place;	1
but	1
those	1
who	1
say	1
so	1
talk	1
at	1
random	1
and	1
with	1
little	1
knowledge	1
of	1
such	1
matters;	1
for	1
if	1
in	1
the	1
Goletta	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
fort	1
there	1
were	1
barely	1
seven	1
thousand	1
soldiers,	1
how	1
could	1
such	1
a	1
small	1
number,	1
however	1
resolute,	1
sally	1
out	1
and	1
hold	1
their	1
own	1
against	1
numbers	1
like	1
those	1
of	1
the	1
enemy?	1
And	1
how	1
is	1
it	1
possible	1
to	1
help	1
losing	1
a	1
stronghold	1
that	1
is	1
not	1
relieved,	1
above	1
all	1
when	1
surrounded	1
by	1
a	1
host	1
of	1
determined	1
enemies	1
in	1
their	1
own	1
country?	1
But	1
many	1
thought,	1
and	1
I	1
thought	1
so	1
too,	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
special	1
favour	1
and	1
mercy	1
which	1
Heaven	1
showed	1
to	1
Spain	1
in	1
permitting	1
the	1
destruction	1
of	1
that	1
source	1
and	1
hiding	1
place	1
of	1
mischief,	1
that	1
devourer,	1
sponge,	1
and	1
moth	1
of	1
countless	1
money,	1
fruitlessly	1
wasted	1
there	1
to	1
no	1
other	1
purpose	1
save	1
preserving	1
the	1
memory	1
of	1
its	1
capture	1
by	1
the	1
invincible	1
Charles	1
V.;	1
as	1
if	1
to	1
make	1
that	1
eternal,	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
and	1
will	1
be,	1
these	1
stones	1
were	1
needed	1
to	1
support	1
it.	1
The	1
fort	1
also	1
fell;	1
but	1
the	1
Turks	1
had	1
to	1
win	1
it	1
inch	1
by	1
inch,	1
for	1
the	1
soldiers	1
who	1
defended	1
it	1
fought	1
so	1
gallantly	1
and	1
stoutly	1
that	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
the	1
enemy	1
killed	1
in	1
twenty-two	1
general	1
assaults	1
exceeded	1
twenty-five	1
thousand.	1
Of	1
three	1
hundred	1
that	1
remained	1
alive	1
not	1
one	1
was	1
taken	1
unwounded,	1
a	1
clear	1
and	1
manifest	1
proof	1
of	1
their	1
gallantry	1
and	1
resolution,	1
and	1
how	1
sturdily	1
they	1
had	1
defended	1
themselves	1
and	1
held	1
their	1
post.	1
A	1
small	1
fort	1
or	1
tower	1
which	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
lagoon	1
under	1
the	1
command	1
of	1
Don	1
Juan	1
Zanoguera,	1
a	1
Valencian	1
gentleman	1
and	1
a	1
famous	1
soldier,	1
capitulated	1
upon	1
terms.	1
They	1
took	1
prisoner	1
Don	1
Pedro	1
Puertocarrero,	1
commandant	1
of	1
the	1
Goletta,	1
who	1
had	1
done	1
all	1
in	1
his	1
power	1
to	1
defend	1
his	1
fortress,	1
and	1
took	1
the	1
loss	1
of	1
it	1
so	1
much	1
to	1
heart	1
that	1
he	1
died	1
of	1
grief	1
on	1
the	1
way	1
to	1
Constantinople,	1
where	1
they	1
were	1
carrying	1
him	1
a	1
prisoner.	1
They	1
also	1
took	1
the	1
commandant	1
of	1
the	1
fort,	1
Gabrio	1
Cerbellon	1
by	1
name,	1
a	1
Milanese	1
gentleman,	1
a	1
great	1
engineer	1
and	1
a	1
very	1
brave	1
soldier.	1
In	1
these	1
two	1
fortresses	1
perished	1
many	1
persons	1
of	1
note,	1
among	1
whom	1
was	1
Pagano	1
Doria,	1
knight	1
of	1
the	1
Order	1
of	1
St.	1
John,	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
generous	1
disposition,	1
as	1
was	1
shown	1
by	1
his	1
extreme	1
liberality	1
to	1
his	1
brother,	1
the	1
famous	1
John	1
Andrea	1
Doria;	1
and	1
what	1
made	1
his	1
death	1
the	1
more	1
sad	1
was	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
slain	1
by	1
some	1
Arabs	1
to	1
whom,	1
seeing	1
that	1
the	1
fort	1
was	1
now	1
lost,	1
he	1
entrusted	1
himself,	1
and	1
who	1
offered	1
to	1
conduct	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
disguise	1
of	1
a	1
Moor	1
to	1
Tabarca,	1
a	1
small	1
fort	1
or	1
station	1
on	1
the	1
coast	1
held	1
by	1
the	1
Genoese	1
employed	1
in	1
the	1
coral	1
fishery.	1
These	1
Arabs	1
cut	1
off	1
his	1
head	1
and	1
carried	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
commander	1
of	1
the	1
Turkish	1
fleet,	1
who	1
proved	1
on	1
them	1
the	1
truth	1
of	1
our	1
Castilian	1
proverb,	1
that	1
“though	1
the	1
treason	1
may	1
please,	1
the	1
traitor	1
is	1
hated;”	1
for	1
they	1
say	1
he	1
ordered	1
those	1
who	1
brought	1
him	1
the	1
present	1
to	1
be	1
hanged	1
for	1
not	1
having	1
brought	1
him	1
alive.	1

Among	1
the	1
Christians	1
who	1
were	1
taken	1
in	1
the	1
fort	1
was	1
one	1
named	1
Don	1
Pedro	1
de	1
Aguilar,	1
a	1
native	1
of	1
some	1
place,	1
I	1
know	1
not	1
what,	1
in	1
Andalusia,	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
ensign	1
in	1
the	1
fort,	1
a	1
soldier	1
of	1
great	1
repute	1
and	1
rare	1
intelligence,	1
who	1
had	1
in	1
particular	1
a	1
special	1
gift	1
for	1
what	1
they	1
call	1
poetry.	1
I	1
say	1
so	1
because	1
his	1
fate	1
brought	1
him	1
to	1
my	1
galley	1
and	1
to	1
my	1
bench,	1
and	1
made	1
him	1
a	1
slave	1
to	1
the	1
same	1
master;	1
and	1
before	1
we	1
left	1
the	1
port	1
this	1
gentleman	1
composed	1
two	1
sonnets	1
by	1
way	1
of	1
epitaphs,	1
one	1
on	1
the	1
Goletta	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
on	1
the	1
fort;	1
indeed,	1
I	1
may	1
as	1
well	1
repeat	1
them,	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
them	1
by	1
heart,	1
and	1
I	1
think	1
they	1
will	1
be	1
liked	1
rather	1
than	1
disliked.	1
The	1
instant	1
the	1
captive	1
mentioned	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Don	1
Pedro	1
de	1
Aguilar,	1
Don	1
Fernando	1
looked	1
at	1
his	1
companions	1
and	1
they	1
all	1
three	1
smiled;	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
speak	1
of	1
the	1
sonnets	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
said,	1
“Before	1
your	1
worship	1
proceeds	1
any	1
further	1
I	1
entreat	1
you	1
to	1
tell	1
me	1
what	1
became	1
of	1
that	1
Don	1
Pedro	1
de	1
Aguilar	1
you	1
have	1
spoken	1
of.”	1
“All	1
I	1
know	1
is,”	1
replied	1
the	1
captive,	1
“that	1
after	1
having	1
been	1
in	1
Constantinople	1
two	1
years,	1
he	1
escaped	1
in	1
the	1
disguise	1
of	1
an	1
Arnaut,	1
in	1
company	1
with	1
a	1
Greek	1
spy;	1
but	1
whether	1
he	1
regained	1
his	1
liberty	1
or	1
not	1
I	1
cannot	1
tell,	1
though	1
I	1
fancy	1
he	1
did,	1
because	1
a	1
year	1
afterwards	1
I	1
saw	1
the	1
Greek	1
at	1
Constantinople,	1
though	1
I	1
was	1
unable	1
to	1
ask	1
him	1
what	1
the	1
result	1
of	1
the	1
journey	1
was.”	1
“Well	1
then,	1
you	1
are	1
right,”	1
returned	1
the	1
gentleman,	1
“for	1
that	1
Don	1
Pedro	1
is	1
my	1
brother,	1
and	1
he	1
is	1
now	1
in	1
our	1
village	1
in	1
good	1
health,	1
rich,	1
married,	1
and	1
with	1
three	1
children.”	1
“Thanks	1
be	1
to	1
God	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
mercies	1
he	1
has	1
shown	1
him,”	1
said	1
the	1
captive;	1
“for	1
to	1
my	1
mind	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
happiness	1
on	1
earth	1
to	1
compare	1
with	1
recovering	1
lost	1
liberty.”	1
“And	1
what	1
is	1
more,”	1
said	1
the	1
gentleman,	1
“I	1
know	1
the	1
sonnets	1
my	1
brother	1
made.”	1
“Then	1
let	1
your	1
worship	1
repeat	1
them,”	1
said	1
the	1
captive,	1
“for	1
you	1
will	1
recite	1
them	1
better	1
than	1
I	1
can.”	1
“With	1
all	1
my	1
heart,”	1
said	1
the	1
gentleman;	1
“that	1
on	1
the	1
Goletta	1
runs	1
thus.”	1

SONNET	1
“Blest	1
souls,	1
that,	1
from	1
this	1
mortal	1
husk	1
set	1
free,	1
In	1
guerdon	1
of	1
brave	1
deeds	1
beatified,	1
Above	1
this	1
lowly	1
orb	1
of	1
ours	1
abide	1
Made	1
heirs	1
of	1
heaven	1
and	1
immortality,	1
With	1
noble	1
rage	1
and	1
ardour	1
glowing	1
ye	1
Your	1
strength,	1
while	1
strength	1
was	1
yours,	1
in	1
battle	1
plied,	1
And	1
with	1
your	1
own	1
blood	1
and	1
the	1
foeman’s	1
dyed	1
The	1
sandy	1
soil	1
and	1
the	1
encircling	1
sea.	1
It	1
was	1
the	1
ebbing	1
life-blood	1
first	1
that	1
failed	1
The	1
weary	1
arms;	1
the	1
stout	1
hearts	1
never	1
quailed.	1
Though	1
vanquished,	1
yet	1
ye	1
earned	1
the	1
victor’s	1
crown:	1
Though	1
mourned,	1
yet	1
still	1
triumphant	1
was	1
your	1
fall	1
For	1
there	1
ye	1
won,	1
between	1
the	1
sword	1
and	1
wall,	1
In	1
Heaven	1
glory	1
and	1
on	1
earth	1
renown.”	1
“That	1
is	1
it	1
exactly,	1
according	1
to	1
my	1
recollection,”	1
said	1
the	1
captive.	1
“Well	1
then,	1
that	1
on	1
the	1
fort,”	1
said	1
the	1
gentleman,	1
“if	1
my	1
memory	1
serves	1
me,	1
goes	1
thus:	1
SONNET	1
“Up	1
from	1
this	1
wasted	1
soil,	1
this	1
shattered	1
shell,	1
Whose	1
walls	1
and	1
towers	1
here	1
in	1
ruin	1
lie,	1
Three	1
thousand	1
soldier	1
souls	1
took	1
wing	1
on	1
high,	1
In	1
the	1
bright	1
mansions	1
of	1
the	1
blest	1
to	1
dwell.	1
The	1
onslaught	1
of	1
the	1
foeman	1
to	1
repel	1
By	1
might	1
of	1
arm	1
all	1
vainly	1
did	1
they	1
try,	1
And	1
when	1
at	1
length	1
’twas	1
left	1
them	1
but	1
to	1
die,	1
Wearied	1
and	1
few	1
the	1
last	1
defenders	1
fell.	1
And	1
this	1
same	1
arid	1
soil	1
hath	1
ever	1
been	1
A	1
haunt	1
of	1
countless	1
mournful	1
memories,	1
As	1
well	1
in	1
our	1
day	1
as	1
in	1
days	1
of	1
yore.	1
But	1
never	1
yet	1
to	1
Heaven	1
it	1
sent,	1
I	1
ween,	1
From	1
its	1
hard	1
bosom	1
purer	1
souls	1
than	1
these,	1
Or	1
braver	1
bodies	1
on	1
its	1
surface	1
bore.”	1
The	1
sonnets	1
were	1
not	1
disliked,	1
and	1
the	1
captive	1
was	1
rejoiced	1
at	1
the	1
tidings	1
they	1
gave	1
him	1
of	1
his	1
comrade,	1
and	1
continuing	1
his	1
tale,	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
to	1
say:	1
The	1
Goletta	1
and	1
the	1
fort	1
being	1
thus	1
in	1
their	1
hands,	1
the	1
Turks	1
gave	1
orders	1
to	1
dismantle	1
the	1
Goletta—for	1
the	1
fort	1
was	1
reduced	1
to	1
such	1
a	1
state	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
nothing	1
left	1
to	1
level—and	1
to	1
do	1
the	1
work	1
more	1
quickly	1
and	1
easily	1
they	1
mined	1
it	1
in	1
three	1
places;	1
but	1
nowhere	1
were	1
they	1
able	1
to	1
blow	1
up	1
the	1
part	1
which	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
least	1
strong,	1
that	1
is	1
to	1
say,	1
the	1
old	1
walls,	1
while	1
all	1
that	1
remained	1
standing	1
of	1
the	1
new	1
fortifications	1
that	1
the	1
Fratin	1
had	1
made	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
ground	1
with	1
the	1
greatest	1
ease.	1
Finally	1
the	1
fleet	1
returned	1
victorious	1
and	1
triumphant	1
to	1
Constantinople,	1
and	1
a	1
few	1
months	1
later	1
died	1
my	1
master,	1
El	1
Uchali,	1
otherwise	1
Uchali	1
Fartax,	1
which	1
means	1
in	1
Turkish	1
“the	1
scabby	1
renegade;”	1
for	1
that	1
he	1
was;	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
practice	1
with	1
the	1
Turks	1
to	1
name	1
people	1
from	1
some	1
defect	1
or	1
virtue	1
they	1
may	1
possess;	1
the	1
reason	1
being	1
that	1
there	1
are	1
among	1
them	1
only	1
four	1
surnames	1
belonging	1
to	1
families	1
tracing	1
their	1
descent	1
from	1
the	1
Ottoman	1
house,	1
and	1
the	1
others,	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
said,	1
take	1
their	1
names	1
and	1
surnames	1
either	1
from	1
bodily	1
blemishes	1
or	1
moral	1
qualities.	1
This	1
“scabby	1
one”	1
rowed	1
at	1
the	1
oar	1
as	1
a	1
slave	1
of	1
the	1
Grand	1
Signor’s	1
for	1
fourteen	1
years,	1
and	1
when	1
over	1
thirty-four	1
years	1
of	1
age,	1
in	1
resentment	1
at	1
having	1
been	1
struck	1
by	1
a	1
Turk	1
while	1
at	1
the	1
oar,	1
turned	1
renegade	1
and	1
renounced	1
his	1
faith	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
revenge	1
himself;	1
and	1
such	1
was	1
his	1
valour	1
that,	1
without	1
owing	1
his	1
advancement	1
to	1
the	1
base	1
ways	1
and	1
means	1
by	1
which	1
most	1
favourites	1
of	1
the	1
Grand	1
Signor	1
rise	1
to	1
power,	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
be	1
king	1
of	1
Algiers,	1
and	1
afterwards	1
general-on-sea,	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
third	1
place	1
of	1
trust	1
in	1
the	1
realm.	1
He	1
was	1
a	1
Calabrian	1
by	1
birth,	1
and	1
a	1
worthy	1
man	1
morally,	1
and	1
he	1
treated	1
his	1
slaves	1
with	1
great	1
humanity.	1
He	1
had	1
three	1
thousand	1
of	1
them,	1
and	1
after	1
his	1
death	1
they	1
were	1
divided,	1
as	1
he	1
directed	1
by	1
his	1
will,	1
between	1
the	1
Grand	1
Signor	1
(who	1
is	1
heir	1
of	1
all	1
who	1
die	1
and	1
shares	1
with	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
the	1
deceased)	1
and	1
his	1
renegades.	1
I	1
fell	1
to	1
the	1
lot	1
of	1
a	1
Venetian	1
renegade	1
who,	1
when	1
a	1
cabin	1
boy	1
on	1
board	1
a	1
ship,	1
had	1
been	1
taken	1
by	1
Uchali	1
and	1
was	1
so	1
much	1
beloved	1
by	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
became	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
most	1
favoured	1
youths.	1
He	1
came	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
most	1
cruel	1
renegade	1
I	1
ever	1
saw:	1
his	1
name	1
was	1
Hassan	1
Aga,	1
and	1
he	1
grew	1
very	1
rich	1
and	1
became	1
king	1
of	1
Algiers.	1
With	1
him	1
I	1
went	1
there	1
from	1
Constantinople,	1
rather	1
glad	1
to	1
be	1
so	1
near	1
Spain,	1
not	1
that	1
I	1
intended	1
to	1
write	1
to	1
anyone	1
about	1
my	1
unhappy	1
lot,	1
but	1
to	1
try	1
if	1
fortune	1
would	1
be	1
kinder	1
to	1
me	1
in	1
Algiers	1
than	1
in	1
Constantinople,	1
where	1
I	1
had	1
attempted	1
in	1
a	1
thousand	1
ways	1
to	1
escape	1
without	1
ever	1
finding	1
a	1
favourable	1
time	1
or	1
chance;	1
but	1
in	1
Algiers	1
I	1
resolved	1
to	1
seek	1
for	1
other	1
means	1
of	1
effecting	1
the	1
purpose	1
I	1
cherished	1
so	1
dearly;	1
for	1
the	1
hope	1
of	1
obtaining	1
my	1
liberty	1
never	1
deserted	1
me;	1
and	1
when	1
in	1
my	1
plots	1
and	1
schemes	1
and	1
attempts	1
the	1
result	1
did	1
not	1
answer	1
my	1
expectations,	1
without	1
giving	1
way	1
to	1
despair	1
I	1
immediately	1
began	1
to	1
look	1
out	1
for	1
or	1
conjure	1
up	1
some	1
new	1
hope	1
to	1
support	1
me,	1
however	1
faint	1
or	1
feeble	1
it	1
might	1
be.	1
In	1
this	1
way	1
I	1
lived	1
on	1
immured	1
in	1
a	1
building	1
or	1
prison	1
called	1
by	1
the	1
Turks	1
a	1
baño	1
in	1
which	1
they	1
confine	1
the	1
Christian	1
captives,	1
as	1
well	1
those	1
that	1
are	1
the	1
king’s	1
as	1
those	1
belonging	1
to	1
private	1
individuals,	1
and	1
also	1
what	1
they	1
call	1
those	1
of	1
the	1
Almacen,	1
which	1
is	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
to	1
say	1
the	1
slaves	1
of	1
the	1
municipality,	1
who	1
serve	1
the	1
city	1
in	1
the	1
public	1
works	1
and	1
other	1
employments;	1
but	1
captives	1
of	1
this	1
kind	1
recover	1
their	1
liberty	1
with	1
great	1
difficulty,	1
for,	1
as	1
they	1
are	1
public	1
property	1
and	1
have	1
no	1
particular	1
master,	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
one	1
with	1
whom	1
to	1
treat	1
for	1
their	1
ransom,	1
even	1
though	1
they	1
may	1
have	1
the	1
means.	1
To	1
these	1
baños,	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
said,	1
some	1
private	1
individuals	1
of	1
the	1
town	1
are	1
in	1
the	1
habit	1
of	1
bringing	1
their	1
captives,	1
especially	1
when	1
they	1
are	1
to	1
be	1
ransomed;	1
because	1
there	1
they	1
can	1
keep	1
them	1
in	1
safety	1
and	1
comfort	1
until	1
their	1
ransom	1
arrives.	1
The	1
king’s	1
captives	1
also,	1
that	1
are	1
on	1
ransom,	1
do	1
not	1
go	1
out	1
to	1
work	1
with	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
crew,	1
unless	1
when	1
their	1
ransom	1
is	1
delayed;	1
for	1
then,	1
to	1
make	1
them	1
write	1
for	1
it	1
more	1
pressingly,	1
they	1
compel	1
them	1
to	1
work	1
and	1
go	1
for	1
wood,	1
which	1
is	1
no	1
light	1
labour.	1
I,	1
however,	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
on	1
ransom,	1
for	1
when	1
it	1
was	1
discovered	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
a	1
captain,	1
although	1
I	1
declared	1
my	1
scanty	1
means	1
and	1
want	1
of	1
fortune,	1
nothing	1
could	1
dissuade	1
them	1
from	1
including	1
me	1
among	1
the	1
gentlemen	1
and	1
those	1
waiting	1
to	1
be	1
ransomed.	1
They	1
put	1
a	1
chain	1
on	1
me,	1
more	1
as	1
a	1
mark	1
of	1
this	1
than	1
to	1
keep	1
me	1
safe,	1
and	1
so	1
I	1
passed	1
my	1
life	1
in	1
that	1
baño	1
with	1
several	1
other	1
gentlemen	1
and	1
persons	1
of	1
quality	1
marked	1
out	1
as	1
held	1
to	1
ransom;	1
but	1
though	1
at	1
times,	1
or	1
rather	1
almost	1
always,	1
we	1
suffered	1
from	1
hunger	1
and	1
scanty	1
clothing,	1
nothing	1
distressed	1
us	1
so	1
much	1
as	1
hearing	1
and	1
seeing	1
at	1
every	1
turn	1
the	1
unexampled	1
and	1
unheard-of	1
cruelties	1
my	1
master	1
inflicted	1
upon	1
the	1
Christians.	1
Every	1
day	1
he	1
hanged	1
a	1
man,	1
impaled	1
one,	1
cut	1
off	1
the	1
ears	1
of	1
another;	1
and	1
all	1
with	1
so	1
little	1
provocation,	1
or	1
so	1
entirely	1
without	1
any,	1
that	1
the	1
Turks	1
acknowledged	1
he	1
did	1
it	1
merely	1
for	1
the	1
sake	1
of	1
doing	1
it,	1
and	1
because	1
he	1
was	1
by	1
nature	1
murderously	1
disposed	1
towards	1
the	1
whole	1
human	1
race.	1
The	1
only	1
one	1
that	1
fared	1
at	1
all	1
well	1
with	1
him	1
was	1
a	1
Spanish	1
soldier,	1
something	1
de	1
Saavedra	1
by	1
name,	1
to	1
whom	1
he	1
never	1
gave	1
a	1
blow	1
himself,	1
or	1
ordered	1
a	1
blow	1
to	1
be	1
given,	1
or	1
addressed	1
a	1
hard	1
word,	1
although	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
things	1
that	1
will	1
dwell	1
in	1
the	1
memory	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
there	1
for	1
many	1
a	1
year,	1
and	1
all	1
to	1
recover	1
his	1
liberty;	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
least	1
of	1
the	1
many	1
things	1
he	1
did	1
we	1
all	1
dreaded	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
be	1
impaled,	1
and	1
he	1
himself	1
was	1
in	1
fear	1
of	1
it	1
more	1
than	1
once;	1
and	1
only	1
that	1
time	1
does	1
not	1
allow,	1
I	1
could	1
tell	1
you	1
now	1
something	1
of	1
what	1
that	1
soldier	1
did,	1
that	1
would	1
interest	1
and	1
astonish	1
you	1
much	1
more	1
than	1
the	1
narration	1
of	1
my	1
own	1
tale.	1
To	1
go	1
on	1
with	1
my	1
story;	1
the	1
courtyard	1
of	1
our	1
prison	1
was	1
overlooked	1
by	1
the	1
windows	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
belonging	1
to	1
a	1
wealthy	1
Moor	1
of	1
high	1
position;	1
and	1
these,	1
as	1
is	1
usual	1
in	1
Moorish	1
houses,	1
were	1
rather	1
loopholes	1
than	1
windows,	1
and	1
besides	1
were	1
covered	1
with	1
thick	1
and	1
close	1
lattice-work.	1
It	1
so	1
happened,	1
then,	1
that	1
as	1
I	1
was	1
one	1
day	1
on	1
the	1
terrace	1
of	1
our	1
prison	1
with	1
three	1
other	1
comrades,	1
trying,	1
to	1
pass	1
away	1
the	1
time,	1
how	1
far	1
we	1
could	1
leap	1
with	1
our	1
chains,	1
we	1
being	1
alone,	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
other	1
Christians	1
had	1
gone	1
out	1
to	1
work,	1
I	1
chanced	1
to	1
raise	1
my	1
eyes,	1
and	1
from	1
one	1
of	1
these	1
little	1
closed	1
windows	1
I	1
saw	1
a	1
reed	1
appear	1
with	1
a	1
cloth	1
attached	1
to	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
it,	1
and	1
it	1
kept	1
waving	1
to	1
and	1
fro,	1
and	1
moving	1
as	1
if	1
making	1
signs	1
to	1
us	1
to	1
come	1
and	1
take	1
it.	1
We	1
watched	1
it,	1
and	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
were	1
with	1
me	1
went	1
and	1
stood	1
under	1
the	1
reed	1
to	1
see	1
whether	1
they	1
would	1
let	1
it	1
drop,	1
or	1
what	1
they	1
would	1
do,	1
but	1
as	1
he	1
did	1
so	1
the	1
reed	1
was	1
raised	1
and	1
moved	1
from	1
side	1
to	1
side,	1
as	1
if	1
they	1
meant	1
to	1
say	1
“no”	1
by	1
a	1
shake	1
of	1
the	1
head.	1
The	1
Christian	1
came	1
back,	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
again	1
lowered,	1
making	1
the	1
same	1
movements	1
as	1
before.	1
Another	1
of	1
my	1
comrades	1
went,	1
and	1
with	1
him	1
the	1
same	1
happened	1
as	1
with	1
the	1
first,	1
and	1
then	1
the	1
third	1
went	1
forward,	1
but	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
result	1
as	1
the	1
first	1
and	1
second.	1
Seeing	1
this	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
like	1
not	1
to	1
try	1
my	1
luck,	1
and	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
I	1
came	1
under	1
the	1
reed	1
it	1
was	1
dropped	1
and	1
fell	1
inside	1
the	1
baño	1
at	1
my	1
feet.	1
I	1
hastened	1
to	1
untie	1
the	1
cloth,	1
in	1
which	1
I	1
perceived	1
a	1
knot,	1
and	1
in	1
this	1
were	1
ten	1
cianis,	1
which	1
are	1
coins	1
of	1
base	1
gold,	1
current	1
among	1
the	1
Moors,	1
and	1
each	1
worth	1
ten	1
reals	1
of	1
our	1
money.	1
It	1
is	1
needless	1
to	1
say	1
I	1
rejoiced	1
over	1
this	1
godsend,	1
and	1
my	1
joy	1
was	1
not	1
less	1
than	1
my	1
wonder	1
as	1
I	1
strove	1
to	1
imagine	1
how	1
this	1
good	1
fortune	1
could	1
have	1
come	1
to	1
us,	1
but	1
to	1
me	1
specially;	1
for	1
the	1
evident	1
unwillingness	1
to	1
drop	1
the	1
reed	1
for	1
any	1
but	1
me	1
showed	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
for	1
me	1
the	1
favour	1
was	1
intended.	1
I	1
took	1
my	1
welcome	1
money,	1
broke	1
the	1
reed,	1
and	1
returned	1
to	1
the	1
terrace,	1
and	1
looking	1
up	1
at	1
the	1
window,	1
I	1
saw	1
a	1
very	1
white	1
hand	1
put	1
out	1
that	1
opened	1
and	1
shut	1
very	1
quickly.	1
From	1
this	1
we	1
gathered	1
or	1
fancied	1
that	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
some	1
woman	1
living	1
in	1
that	1
house	1
that	1
had	1
done	1
us	1
this	1
kindness,	1
and	1
to	1
show	1
that	1
we	1
were	1
grateful	1
for	1
it,	1
we	1
made	1
salaams	1
after	1
the	1
fashion	1
of	1
the	1
Moors,	1
bowing	1
the	1
head,	1
bending	1
the	1
body,	1
and	1
crossing	1
the	1
arms	1
on	1
the	1
breast.	1
Shortly	1
afterwards	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
window	1
a	1
small	1
cross	1
made	1
of	1
reeds	1
was	1
put	1
out	1
and	1
immediately	1
withdrawn.	1
This	1
sign	1
led	1
us	1
to	1
believe	1
that	1
some	1
Christian	1
woman	1
was	1
a	1
captive	1
in	1
the	1
house,	1
and	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
she	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
so	1
good	1
to	1
us;	1
but	1
the	1
whiteness	1
of	1
the	1
hand	1
and	1
the	1
bracelets	1
we	1
had	1
perceived	1
made	1
us	1
dismiss	1
that	1
idea,	1
though	1
we	1
thought	1
it	1
might	1
be	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
Christian	1
renegades	1
whom	1
their	1
masters	1
very	1
often	1
take	1
as	1
lawful	1
wives,	1
and	1
gladly,	1
for	1
they	1
prefer	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
women	1
of	1
their	1
own	1
nation.	1
In	1
all	1
our	1
conjectures	1
we	1
were	1
wide	1
of	1
the	1
truth;	1
so	1
from	1
that	1
time	1
forward	1
our	1
sole	1
occupation	1
was	1
watching	1
and	1
gazing	1
at	1
the	1
window	1
where	1
the	1
cross	1
had	1
appeared	1
to	1
us,	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
our	1
pole-star;	1
but	1
at	1
least	1
fifteen	1
days	1
passed	1
without	1
our	1
seeing	1
either	1
it	1
or	1
the	1
hand,	1
or	1
any	1
other	1
sign	1
and	1
though	1
meanwhile	1
we	1
endeavoured	1
with	1
the	1
utmost	1
pains	1
to	1
ascertain	1
who	1
it	1
was	1
that	1
lived	1
in	1
the	1
house,	1
and	1
whether	1
there	1
were	1
any	1
Christian	1
renegade	1
in	1
it,	1
nobody	1
could	1
ever	1
tell	1
us	1
anything	1
more	1
than	1
that	1
he	1
who	1
lived	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
rich	1
Moor	1
of	1
high	1
position,	1
Hadji	1
Morato	1
by	1
name,	1
formerly	1
alcaide	1
of	1
La	1
Pata,	1
an	1
office	1
of	1
high	1
dignity	1
among	1
them.	1
But	1
when	1
we	1
least	1
thought	1
it	1
was	1
going	1
to	1
rain	1
any	1
more	1
cianis	1
from	1
that	1
quarter,	1
we	1
saw	1
the	1
reed	1
suddenly	1
appear	1
with	1
another	1
cloth	1
tied	1
in	1
a	1
larger	1
knot	1
attached	1
to	1
it,	1
and	1
this	1
at	1
a	1
time	1
when,	1
as	1
on	1
the	1
former	1
occasion,	1
the	1
baño	1
was	1
deserted	1
and	1
unoccupied.	1

We	1
made	1
trial	1
as	1
before,	1
each	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
three	1
going	1
forward	1
before	1
I	1
did;	1
but	1
the	1
reed	1
was	1
delivered	1
to	1
none	1
but	1
me,	1
and	1
on	1
my	1
approach	1
it	1
was	1
let	1
drop.	1
I	1
untied	1
the	1
knot	1
and	1
I	1
found	1
forty	1
Spanish	1
gold	1
crowns	1
with	1
a	1
paper	1
written	1
in	1
Arabic,	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
writing	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
large	1
cross	1
drawn.	1
I	1
kissed	1
the	1
cross,	1
took	1
the	1
crowns	1
and	1
returned	1
to	1
the	1
terrace,	1
and	1
we	1
all	1
made	1
our	1
salaams;	1
again	1
the	1
hand	1
appeared,	1
I	1
made	1
signs	1
that	1
I	1
would	1
read	1
the	1
paper,	1
and	1
then	1
the	1
window	1
was	1
closed.	1
We	1
were	1
all	1
puzzled,	1
though	1
filled	1
with	1
joy	1
at	1
what	1
had	1
taken	1
place;	1
and	1
as	1
none	1
of	1
us	1
understood	1
Arabic,	1
great	1
was	1
our	1
curiosity	1
to	1
know	1
what	1
the	1
paper	1
contained,	1
and	1
still	1
greater	1
the	1
difficulty	1
of	1
finding	1
someone	1
to	1
read	1
it.	1
At	1
last	1
I	1
resolved	1
to	1
confide	1
in	1
a	1
renegade,	1
a	1
native	1
of	1
Murcia,	1
who	1
professed	1
a	1
very	1
great	1
friendship	1
for	1
me,	1
and	1
had	1
given	1
pledges	1
that	1
bound	1
him	1
to	1
keep	1
any	1
secret	1
I	1
might	1
entrust	1
to	1
him;	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
custom	1
with	1
some	1
renegades,	1
when	1
they	1
intend	1
to	1
return	1
to	1
Christian	1
territory,	1
to	1
carry	1
about	1
them	1
certificates	1
from	1
captives	1
of	1
mark	1
testifying,	1
in	1
whatever	1
form	1
they	1
can,	1
that	1
such	1
and	1
such	1
a	1
renegade	1
is	1
a	1
worthy	1
man	1
who	1
has	1
always	1
shown	1
kindness	1
to	1
Christians,	1
and	1
is	1
anxious	1
to	1
escape	1
on	1
the	1
first	1
opportunity	1
that	1
may	1
present	1
itself.	1
Some	1
obtain	1
these	1
testimonials	1
with	1
good	1
intentions,	1
others	1
put	1
them	1
to	1
a	1
cunning	1
use;	1
for	1
when	1
they	1
go	1
to	1
pillage	1
on	1
Christian	1
territory,	1
if	1
they	1
chance	1
to	1
be	1
cast	1
away,	1
or	1
taken	1
prisoners,	1
they	1
produce	1
their	1
certificates	1
and	1
say	1
that	1
from	1
these	1
papers	1
may	1
be	1
seen	1
the	1
object	1
they	1
came	1
for,	1
which	1
was	1
to	1
remain	1
on	1
Christian	1
ground,	1
and	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
to	1
this	1
end	1
they	1
joined	1
the	1
Turks	1
in	1
their	1
foray.	1
In	1
this	1
way	1
they	1
escape	1
the	1
consequences	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
outburst	1
and	1
make	1
their	1
peace	1
with	1
the	1
Church	1
before	1
it	1
does	1
them	1
any	1
harm,	1
and	1
then	1
when	1
they	1
have	1
the	1
chance	1
they	1
return	1
to	1
Barbary	1
to	1
become	1
what	1
they	1
were	1
before.	1
Others,	1
however,	1
there	1
are	1
who	1
procure	1
these	1
papers	1
and	1
make	1
use	1
of	1
them	1
honestly,	1
and	1
remain	1
on	1
Christian	1
soil.	1
This	1
friend	1
of	1
mine,	1
then,	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
these	1
renegades	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
described;	1
he	1
had	1
certificates	1
from	1
all	1
our	1
comrades,	1
in	1
which	1
we	1
testified	1
in	1
his	1
favour	1
as	1
strongly	1
as	1
we	1
could;	1
and	1
if	1
the	1
Moors	1
had	1
found	1
the	1
papers	1
they	1
would	1
have	1
burned	1
him	1
alive.	1
I	1
knew	1
that	1
he	1
understood	1
Arabic	1
very	1
well,	1
and	1
could	1
not	1
only	1
speak	1
but	1
also	1
write	1
it;	1
but	1
before	1
I	1
disclosed	1
the	1
whole	1
matter	1
to	1
him,	1
I	1
asked	1
him	1
to	1
read	1
for	1
me	1
this	1
paper	1
which	1
I	1
had	1
found	1
by	1
accident	1
in	1
a	1
hole	1
in	1
my	1
cell.	1
He	1
opened	1
it	1
and	1
remained	1
some	1
time	1
examining	1
it	1
and	1
muttering	1
to	1
himself	1
as	1
he	1
translated	1
it.	1
I	1
asked	1
him	1
if	1
he	1
understood	1
it,	1
and	1
he	1
told	1
me	1
he	1
did	1
perfectly	1
well,	1
and	1
that	1
if	1
I	1
wished	1
him	1
to	1
tell	1
me	1
its	1
meaning	1
word	1
for	1
word,	1
I	1
must	1
give	1
him	1
pen	1
and	1
ink	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
do	1
it	1
more	1
satisfactorily.	1
We	1
at	1
once	1
gave	1
him	1
what	1
he	1
required,	1
and	1
he	1
set	1
about	1
translating	1
it	1
bit	1
by	1
bit,	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
he	1
said:	1
“All	1
that	1
is	1
here	1
in	1
Spanish	1
is	1
what	1
the	1
Moorish	1
paper	1
contains,	1
and	1
you	1
must	1
bear	1
in	1
mind	1
that	1
when	1
it	1
says	1
‘Lela	1
Marien’	1
it	1
means	1
‘Our	1
Lady	1
the	1
Virgin	1
Mary.’”	1
We	1
read	1
the	1
paper	1
and	1
it	1
ran	1
thus:	1
“When	1
I	1
was	1
a	1
child	1
my	1
father	1
had	1
a	1
slave	1
who	1
taught	1
me	1
to	1
pray	1
the	1
Christian	1
prayer	1
in	1
my	1
own	1
language,	1
and	1
told	1
me	1
many	1
things	1
about	1
Lela	1
Marien.	1
The	1
Christian	1
died,	1
and	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
fire,	1
but	1
to	1
Allah,	1
because	1
since	1
then	1
I	1
have	1
seen	1
her	1
twice,	1
and	1
she	1
told	1
me	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
the	1
Christians	1
to	1
see	1
Lela	1
Marien,	1
who	1
had	1
great	1
love	1
for	1
me.	1
I	1
know	1
not	1
how	1
to	1
go.	1
I	1
have	1
seen	1
many	1
Christians,	1
but	1
except	1
thyself	1
none	1
has	1
seemed	1
to	1
me	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
gentleman.	1
I	1
am	1
young	1
and	1
beautiful,	1
and	1
have	1
plenty	1
of	1
money	1
to	1
take	1
with	1
me.	1
See	1
if	1
thou	1
canst	1
contrive	1
how	1
we	1
may	1
go,	1
and	1
if	1
thou	1
wilt	1
thou	1
shalt	1
be	1
my	1
husband	1
there,	1
and	1
if	1
thou	1
wilt	1
not	1
it	1
will	1
not	1
distress	1
me,	1
for	1
Lela	1
Marien	1
will	1
find	1
me	1
someone	1
to	1
marry	1
me.	1
I	1
myself	1
have	1
written	1
this:	1
have	1
a	1
care	1
to	1
whom	1
thou	1
givest	1
it	1
to	1
read:	1
trust	1
no	1
Moor,	1
for	1
they	1
are	1
all	1
perfidious.	1
I	1
am	1
greatly	1
troubled	1
on	1
this	1
account,	1
for	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
thee	1
confide	1
in	1
anyone,	1
because	1
if	1
my	1
father	1
knew	1
it	1
he	1
would	1
at	1
once	1
fling	1
me	1
down	1
a	1
well	1
and	1
cover	1
me	1
with	1
stones.	1
I	1
will	1
put	1
a	1
thread	1
to	1
the	1
reed;	1
tie	1
the	1
answer	1
to	1
it,	1
and	1
if	1
thou	1
hast	1
no	1
one	1
to	1
write	1
for	1
thee	1
in	1
Arabic,	1
tell	1
it	1
to	1
me	1
by	1
signs,	1
for	1
Lela	1
Marien	1
will	1
make	1
me	1
understand	1
thee.	1
She	1
and	1
Allah	1
and	1
this	1
cross,	1
which	1
I	1
often	1
kiss	1
as	1
the	1
captive	1
bade	1
me,	1
protect	1
thee.”	1
Judge,	1
sirs,	1
whether	1
we	1
had	1
reason	1
for	1
surprise	1
and	1
joy	1
at	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
this	1
paper;	1
and	1
both	1
one	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
were	1
so	1
great,	1
that	1
the	1
renegade	1
perceived	1
that	1
the	1
paper	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
found	1
by	1
chance,	1
but	1
had	1
been	1
in	1
reality	1
addressed	1
to	1
someone	1
of	1
us,	1
and	1
he	1
begged	1
us,	1
if	1
what	1
he	1
suspected	1
were	1
the	1
truth,	1
to	1
trust	1
him	1
and	1
tell	1
him	1
all,	1
for	1
he	1
would	1
risk	1
his	1
life	1
for	1
our	1
freedom;	1
and	1
so	1
saying	1
he	1
took	1
out	1
from	1
his	1
breast	1
a	1
metal	1
crucifix,	1
and	1
with	1
many	1
tears	1
swore	1
by	1
the	1
God	1
the	1
image	1
represented,	1
in	1
whom,	1
sinful	1
and	1
wicked	1
as	1
he	1
was,	1
he	1
truly	1
and	1
faithfully	1
believed,	1
to	1
be	1
loyal	1
to	1
us	1
and	1
keep	1
secret	1
whatever	1
we	1
chose	1
to	1
reveal	1
to	1
him;	1
for	1
he	1
thought	1
and	1
almost	1
foresaw	1
that	1
by	1
means	1
of	1
her	1
who	1
had	1
written	1
that	1
paper,	1
he	1
and	1
all	1
of	1
us	1
would	1
obtain	1
our	1
liberty,	1
and	1
he	1
himself	1
obtain	1
the	1
object	1
he	1
so	1
much	1
desired,	1
his	1
restoration	1
to	1
the	1
bosom	1
of	1
the	1
Holy	1
Mother	1
Church,	1
from	1
which	1
by	1
his	1
own	1
sin	1
and	1
ignorance	1
he	1
was	1
now	1
severed	1
like	1
a	1
corrupt	1
limb.	1
The	1
renegade	1
said	1
this	1
with	1
so	1
many	1
tears	1
and	1
such	1
signs	1
of	1
repentance,	1
that	1
with	1
one	1
consent	1
we	1
all	1
agreed	1
to	1
tell	1
him	1
the	1
whole	1
truth	1
of	1
the	1
matter,	1
and	1
so	1
we	1
gave	1
him	1
a	1
full	1
account	1
of	1
all,	1
without	1
hiding	1
anything	1
from	1
him.	1
We	1
pointed	1
out	1
to	1
him	1
the	1
window	1
at	1
which	1
the	1
reed	1
appeared,	1
and	1
he	1
by	1
that	1
means	1
took	1
note	1
of	1
the	1
house,	1
and	1
resolved	1
to	1
ascertain	1
with	1
particular	1
care	1
who	1
lived	1
in	1
it.	1
We	1
agreed	1
also	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
advisable	1
to	1
answer	1
the	1
Moorish	1
lady’s	1
letter,	1
and	1
the	1
renegade	1
without	1
a	1
moment’s	1
delay	1
took	1
down	1
the	1
words	1
I	1
dictated	1
to	1
him,	1
which	1
were	1
exactly	1
what	1
I	1
shall	1
tell	1
you,	1
for	1
nothing	1
of	1
importance	1
that	1
took	1
place	1
in	1
this	1
affair	1
has	1
escaped	1
my	1
memory,	1
or	1
ever	1
will	1
while	1
life	1
lasts.	1
This,	1
then,	1
was	1
the	1
answer	1
returned	1
to	1
the	1
Moorish	1
lady:	1
“The	1
true	1
Allah	1
protect	1
thee,	1
Lady,	1
and	1
that	1
blessed	1
Marien	1
who	1
is	1
the	1
true	1
mother	1
of	1
God,	1
and	1
who	1
has	1
put	1
it	1
into	1
thy	1
heart	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
the	1
Christians,	1
because	1
she	1
loves	1
thee.	1
Entreat	1
her	1
that	1
she	1
be	1
pleased	1
to	1
show	1
thee	1
how	1
thou	1
canst	1
execute	1
the	1
command	1
she	1
gives	1
thee,	1
for	1
she	1
will,	1
such	1
is	1
her	1
goodness.	1
On	1
my	1
own	1
part,	1
and	1
on	1
that	1
of	1
all	1
these	1
Christians	1
who	1
are	1
with	1
me,	1
I	1
promise	1
to	1
do	1
all	1
that	1
we	1
can	1
for	1
thee,	1
even	1
to	1
death.	1
Fail	1
not	1
to	1
write	1
to	1
me	1
and	1
inform	1
me	1
what	1
thou	1
dost	1
mean	1
to	1
do,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
always	1
answer	1
thee;	1
for	1
the	1
great	1
Allah	1
has	1
given	1
us	1
a	1
Christian	1
captive	1
who	1
can	1
speak	1
and	1
write	1
thy	1
language	1
well,	1
as	1
thou	1
mayest	1
see	1
by	1
this	1
paper;	1
without	1
fear,	1
therefore,	1
thou	1
canst	1
inform	1
us	1
of	1
all	1
thou	1
wouldst.	1
As	1
to	1
what	1
thou	1
sayest,	1
that	1
if	1
thou	1
dost	1
reach	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
the	1
Christians	1
thou	1
wilt	1
be	1
my	1
wife,	1
I	1
give	1
thee	1
my	1
promise	1
upon	1
it	1
as	1
a	1
good	1
Christian;	1
and	1
know	1
that	1
the	1
Christians	1
keep	1
their	1
promises	1
better	1
than	1
the	1
Moors.	1
Allah	1
and	1
Marien	1
his	1
mother	1
watch	1
over	1
thee,	1
my	1
Lady.”	1
The	1
paper	1
being	1
written	1
and	1
folded	1
I	1
waited	1
two	1
days	1
until	1
the	1
baño	1
was	1
empty	1
as	1
before,	1
and	1
immediately	1
repaired	1
to	1
the	1
usual	1
walk	1
on	1
the	1
terrace	1
to	1
see	1
if	1
there	1
were	1
any	1
sign	1
of	1
the	1
reed,	1
which	1
was	1
not	1
long	1
in	1
making	1
its	1
appearance.	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
I	1
saw	1
it,	1
although	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
distinguish	1
who	1
put	1
it	1
out,	1
I	1
showed	1
the	1
paper	1
as	1
a	1
sign	1
to	1
attach	1
the	1
thread,	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
already	1
fixed	1
to	1
the	1
reed,	1
and	1
to	1
it	1
I	1
tied	1
the	1
paper;	1
and	1
shortly	1
afterwards	1
our	1
star	1
once	1
more	1
made	1
its	1
appearance	1
with	1
the	1
white	1
flag	1
of	1
peace,	1
the	1
little	1
bundle.	1
It	1
was	1
dropped,	1
and	1
I	1
picked	1
it	1
up,	1
and	1
found	1
in	1
the	1
cloth,	1
in	1
gold	1
and	1
silver	1
coins	1
of	1
all	1
sorts,	1
more	1
than	1
fifty	1
crowns,	1
which	1
fifty	1
times	1
more	1
strengthened	1
our	1
joy	1
and	1
doubled	1
our	1
hope	1
of	1
gaining	1
our	1
liberty.	1
That	1
very	1
night	1
our	1
renegade	1
returned	1
and	1
said	1
he	1
had	1
learned	1
that	1
the	1
Moor	1
we	1
had	1
been	1
told	1
of	1
lived	1
in	1
that	1
house,	1
that	1
his	1
name	1
was	1
Hadji	1
Morato,	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
enormously	1
rich,	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
one	1
only	1
daughter	1
the	1
heiress	1
of	1
all	1
his	1
wealth,	1
and	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
general	1
opinion	1
throughout	1
the	1
city	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
the	1
most	1
beautiful	1
woman	1
in	1
Barbary,	1
and	1
that	1
several	1
of	1
the	1
viceroys	1
who	1
came	1
there	1
had	1
sought	1
her	1
for	1
a	1
wife,	1
but	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
always	1
unwilling	1
to	1
marry;	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
learned,	1
moreover,	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
a	1
Christian	1
slave	1
who	1
was	1
now	1
dead;	1
all	1
which	1
agreed	1
with	1
the	1
contents	1
of	1
the	1
paper.	1
We	1
immediately	1
took	1
counsel	1
with	1
the	1
renegade	1
as	1
to	1
what	1
means	1
would	1
have	1
to	1
be	1
adopted	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
carry	1
off	1
the	1
Moorish	1
lady	1
and	1
bring	1
us	1
all	1
to	1
Christian	1
territory;	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
end	1
it	1
was	1
agreed	1
that	1
for	1
the	1
present	1
we	1
should	1
wait	1
for	1
a	1
second	1
communication	1
from	1
Zoraida	1
(for	1
that	1
was	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
her	1
who	1
now	1
desires	1
to	1
be	1
called	1
Maria),	1
because	1
we	1
saw	1
clearly	1
that	1
she	1
and	1
no	1
one	1
else	1
could	1
find	1
a	1
way	1
out	1
of	1
all	1
these	1
difficulties.	1
When	1
we	1
had	1
decided	1
upon	1
this	1
the	1
renegade	1
told	1
us	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
uneasy,	1
for	1
he	1
would	1
lose	1
his	1
life	1
or	1
restore	1
us	1
to	1
liberty.	1
For	1
four	1
days	1
the	1
baño	1
was	1
filled	1
with	1
people,	1
for	1
which	1
reason	1
the	1
reed	1
delayed	1
its	1
appearance	1
for	1
four	1
days,	1
but	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
that	1
time,	1
when	1
the	1
baño	1
was,	1
as	1
it	1
generally	1
was,	1
empty,	1
it	1
appeared	1
with	1
the	1
cloth	1
so	1
bulky	1
that	1
it	1
promised	1
a	1
happy	1
birth.	1
Reed	1
and	1
cloth	1
came	1
down	1
to	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
found	1
another	1
paper	1
and	1
a	1
hundred	1
crowns	1
in	1
gold,	1
without	1
any	1
other	1
coin.	1
The	1
renegade	1
was	1
present,	1
and	1
in	1
our	1
cell	1
we	1
gave	1
him	1
the	1
paper	1
to	1
read,	1
which	1
was	1
to	1
this	1
effect:	1
“I	1
cannot	1
think	1
of	1
a	1
plan,	1
señor,	1
for	1
our	1
going	1
to	1
Spain,	1
nor	1
has	1
Lela	1
Marien	1
shown	1
me	1
one,	1
though	1
I	1
have	1
asked	1
her.	1
All	1
that	1
can	1
be	1
done	1
is	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
give	1
you	1
plenty	1
of	1
money	1
in	1
gold	1
from	1
this	1
window.	1
With	1
it	1
ransom	1
yourself	1
and	1
your	1
friends,	1
and	1
let	1
one	1
of	1
you	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
the	1
Christians,	1
and	1
there	1
buy	1
a	1
vessel	1
and	1
come	1
back	1
for	1
the	1
others;	1
and	1
he	1
will	1
find	1
me	1
in	1
my	1
father’s	1
garden,	1
which	1
is	1
at	1
the	1
Babazon	1
gate	1
near	1
the	1
seashore,	1
where	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
all	1
this	1
summer	1
with	1
my	1
father	1
and	1
my	1
servants.	1
You	1
can	1
carry	1
me	1
away	1
from	1
there	1
by	1
night	1
without	1
any	1
danger,	1
and	1
bring	1
me	1
to	1
the	1
vessel.	1
And	1
remember	1
thou	1
art	1
to	1
be	1
my	1
husband,	1
else	1
I	1
will	1
pray	1
to	1
Marien	1
to	1
punish	1
thee.	1
If	1
thou	1
canst	1
not	1
trust	1
anyone	1
to	1
go	1
for	1
the	1
vessel,	1
ransom	1
thyself	1
and	1
do	1
thou	1
go,	1
for	1
I	1
know	1
thou	1
wilt	1
return	1
more	1
surely	1
than	1
any	1
other,	1
as	1
thou	1
art	1
a	1
gentleman	1
and	1
a	1
Christian.	1
Endeavour	1
to	1
make	1
thyself	1
acquainted	1
with	1
the	1
garden;	1
and	1
when	1
I	1
see	1
thee	1
walking	1
yonder	1
I	1
shall	1
know	1
that	1
the	1
baño	1
is	1
empty	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
thee	1
abundance	1
of	1
money.	1
Allah	1
protect	1
thee,	1
señor.”	1
These	1
were	1
the	1
words	1
and	1
contents	1
of	1
the	1
second	1
paper,	1
and	1
on	1
hearing	1
them,	1
each	1
declared	1
himself	1
willing	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
ransomed	1
one,	1
and	1
promised	1
to	1
go	1
and	1
return	1
with	1
scrupulous	1
good	1
faith;	1
and	1
I	1
too	1
made	1
the	1
same	1
offer;	1
but	1
to	1
all	1
this	1
the	1
renegade	1
objected,	1
saying	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
on	1
any	1
account	1
consent	1
to	1
one	1
being	1
set	1
free	1
before	1
all	1
went	1
together,	1
as	1
experience	1
had	1
taught	1
him	1
how	1
ill	1
those	1
who	1
have	1
been	1
set	1
free	1
keep	1
promises	1
which	1
they	1
made	1
in	1
captivity;	1
for	1
captives	1
of	1
distinction	1
frequently	1
had	1
recourse	1
to	1
this	1
plan,	1
paying	1
the	1
ransom	1
of	1
one	1
who	1
was	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
Valencia	1
or	1
Majorca	1
with	1
money	1
to	1
enable	1
him	1
to	1
arm	1
a	1
bark	1
and	1
return	1
for	1
the	1
others	1
who	1
had	1
ransomed	1
him,	1
but	1
who	1
never	1
came	1
back;	1
for	1
recovered	1
liberty	1
and	1
the	1
dread	1
of	1
losing	1
it	1
again	1
efface	1
from	1
the	1
memory	1
all	1
the	1
obligations	1
in	1
the	1
world.	1
And	1
to	1
prove	1
the	1
truth	1
of	1
what	1
he	1
said,	1
he	1
told	1
us	1
briefly	1
what	1
had	1
happened	1
to	1
a	1
certain	1
Christian	1
gentleman	1
almost	1
at	1
that	1
very	1
time,	1
the	1
strangest	1
case	1
that	1
had	1
ever	1
occurred	1
even	1
there,	1
where	1
astonishing	1
and	1
marvellous	1
things	1
are	1
happening	1
every	1
instant.	1
In	1
short,	1
he	1
ended	1
by	1
saying	1
that	1
what	1
could	1
and	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
done	1
was	1
to	1
give	1
the	1
money	1
intended	1
for	1
the	1
ransom	1
of	1
one	1
of	1
us	1
Christians	1
to	1
him,	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
with	1
it	1
buy	1
a	1
vessel	1
there	1
in	1
Algiers	1
under	1
the	1
pretence	1
of	1
becoming	1
a	1
merchant	1
and	1
trader	1
at	1
Tetuan	1
and	1
along	1
the	1
coast;	1
and	1
when	1
master	1
of	1
the	1
vessel,	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
easy	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
hit	1
on	1
some	1
way	1
of	1
getting	1
us	1
all	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
baño	1
and	1
putting	1
us	1
on	1
board;	1
especially	1
if	1
the	1
Moorish	1
lady	1
gave,	1
as	1
she	1
said,	1
money	1
enough	1
to	1
ransom	1
all,	1
because	1
once	1
free	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
the	1
easiest	1
thing	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
for	1
us	1
to	1
embark	1
even	1
in	1
open	1
day;	1
but	1
the	1
greatest	1
difficulty	1
was	1
that	1
the	1
Moors	1
do	1
not	1
allow	1
any	1
renegade	1
to	1
buy	1
or	1
own	1
any	1
craft,	1
unless	1
it	1
be	1
a	1
large	1
vessel	1
for	1
going	1
on	1
roving	1
expeditions,	1
because	1
they	1
are	1
afraid	1
that	1
anyone	1
who	1
buys	1
a	1
small	1
vessel,	1
especially	1
if	1
he	1
be	1
a	1
Spaniard,	1
only	1
wants	1
it	1
for	1
the	1
purpose	1
of	1
escaping	1
to	1
Christian	1
territory.	1
This	1
however	1
he	1
could	1
get	1
over	1
by	1
arranging	1
with	1
a	1
Tagarin	1
Moor	1
to	1
go	1
shares	1
with	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
purchase	1
of	1
the	1
vessel,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
profit	1
on	1
the	1
cargo;	1
and	1
under	1
cover	1
of	1
this	1
he	1
could	1
become	1
master	1
of	1
the	1
vessel,	1
in	1
which	1
case	1
he	1
looked	1
upon	1
all	1
the	1
rest	1
as	1
accomplished.	1
But	1
though	1
to	1
me	1
and	1
my	1
comrades	1
it	1
had	1
seemed	1
a	1
better	1
plan	1
to	1
send	1
to	1
Majorca	1
for	1
the	1
vessel,	1
as	1
the	1
Moorish	1
lady	1
suggested,	1
we	1
did	1
not	1
dare	1
to	1
oppose	1
him,	1
fearing	1
that	1
if	1
we	1
did	1
not	1
do	1
as	1
he	1
said	1
he	1
would	1
denounce	1
us,	1
and	1
place	1
us	1
in	1
danger	1
of	1
losing	1
all	1
our	1
lives	1
if	1
he	1
were	1
to	1
disclose	1
our	1
dealings	1
with	1
Zoraida,	1
for	1
whose	1
life	1
we	1
would	1
have	1
all	1
given	1
our	1
own.	1
We	1
therefore	1
resolved	1
to	1
put	1
ourselves	1
in	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
God	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
renegade’s;	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
an	1
answer	1
was	1
given	1
to	1
Zoraida,	1
telling	1
her	1
that	1
we	1
would	1
do	1
all	1
she	1
recommended,	1
for	1
she	1
had	1
given	1
as	1
good	1
advice	1
as	1
if	1
Lela	1
Marien	1
had	1
delivered	1
it,	1
and	1
that	1
it	1
depended	1
on	1
her	1
alone	1
whether	1
we	1
were	1
to	1
defer	1
the	1
business	1
or	1
put	1
it	1
in	1
execution	1
at	1
once.	1
I	1
renewed	1
my	1
promise	1
to	1
be	1
her	1
husband;	1
and	1
thus	1
the	1
next	1
day	1
that	1
the	1
baño	1
chanced	1
to	1
be	1
empty	1
she	1
at	1
different	1
times	1
gave	1
us	1
by	1
means	1
of	1
the	1
reed	1
and	1
cloth	1
two	1
thousand	1
gold	1
crowns	1
and	1
a	1
paper	1
in	1
which	1
she	1
said	1
that	1
the	1
next	1
Juma,	1
that	1
is	1
to	1
say	1
Friday,	1
she	1
was	1
going	1
to	1
her	1
father’s	1
garden,	1
but	1
that	1
before	1
she	1
went	1
she	1
would	1
give	1
us	1
more	1
money;	1
and	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
not	1
enough	1
we	1
were	1
to	1
let	1
her	1
know,	1
as	1
she	1
would	1
give	1
us	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
we	1
asked,	1
for	1
her	1
father	1
had	1
so	1
much	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
miss	1
it,	1
and	1
besides	1
she	1
kept	1
all	1
the	1
keys.	1
We	1
at	1
once	1
gave	1
the	1
renegade	1
five	1
hundred	1
crowns	1
to	1
buy	1
the	1
vessel,	1
and	1
with	1
eight	1
hundred	1
I	1
ransomed	1
myself,	1
giving	1
the	1
money	1
to	1
a	1
Valencian	1
merchant	1
who	1
happened	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
Algiers	1
at	1
the	1
time,	1
and	1
who	1
had	1
me	1
released	1
on	1
his	1
word,	1
pledging	1
it	1
that	1
on	1
the	1
arrival	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
ship	1
from	1
Valencia	1
he	1
would	1
pay	1
my	1
ransom;	1
for	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
given	1
the	1
money	1
at	1
once	1
it	1
would	1
have	1
made	1
the	1
king	1
suspect	1
that	1
my	1
ransom	1
money	1
had	1
been	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
in	1
Algiers,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
merchant	1
had	1
for	1
his	1
own	1
advantage	1
kept	1
it	1
secret.	1
In	1
fact	1
my	1
master	1
was	1
so	1
difficult	1
to	1
deal	1
with	1
that	1
I	1
dared	1
not	1
on	1
any	1
account	1
pay	1
down	1
the	1
money	1
at	1
once.	1
The	1
Thursday	1
before	1
the	1
Friday	1
on	1
which	1
the	1
fair	1
Zoraida	1
was	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
garden	1
she	1
gave	1
us	1
a	1
thousand	1
crowns	1
more,	1
and	1
warned	1
us	1
of	1
her	1
departure,	1
begging	1
me,	1
if	1
I	1
were	1
ransomed,	1
to	1
find	1
out	1
her	1
father’s	1
garden	1
at	1
once,	1
and	1
by	1
all	1
means	1
to	1
seek	1
an	1
opportunity	1
of	1
going	1
there	1
to	1
see	1
her.	1
I	1
answered	1
in	1
a	1
few	1
words	1
that	1
I	1
would	1
do	1
so,	1
and	1
that	1
she	1
must	1
remember	1
to	1
commend	1
us	1
to	1
Lela	1
Marien	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
prayers	1
the	1
captive	1
had	1
taught	1
her.	1
This	1
having	1
been	1
done,	1
steps	1
were	1
taken	1
to	1
ransom	1
our	1
three	1
comrades,	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
enable	1
them	1
to	1
quit	1
the	1
baño,	1
and	1
lest,	1
seeing	1
me	1
ransomed	1
and	1
themselves	1
not,	1
though	1
the	1
money	1
was	1
forthcoming,	1
they	1
should	1
make	1
a	1
disturbance	1
about	1
it	1
and	1
the	1
devil	1
should	1
prompt	1
them	1
to	1
do	1
something	1
that	1
might	1
injure	1
Zoraida;	1
for	1
though	1
their	1
position	1
might	1
be	1
sufficient	1
to	1
relieve	1
me	1
from	1
this	1
apprehension,	1
nevertheless	1
I	1
was	1
unwilling	1
to	1
run	1
any	1
risk	1
in	1
the	1
matter;	1
and	1
so	1
I	1
had	1
them	1
ransomed	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
way	1
as	1
I	1
was,	1
handing	1
over	1
all	1
the	1
money	1
to	1
the	1
merchant	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
with	1
safety	1
and	1
confidence	1
give	1
security;	1
without,	1
however,	1
confiding	1
our	1
arrangement	1
and	1
secret	1
to	1
him,	1
which	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
dangerous.	1

CHAPTER	1
XLI.	1
IN	1
WHICH	1
THE	1
CAPTIVE	1
STILL	1
CONTINUES	1
HIS	1
ADVENTURES	1
c41a.jpg	1
(106K)	1
Full	1
Size	1
Before	1
fifteen	1
days	1
were	1
over	1
our	1
renegade	1
had	1
already	1
purchased	1
an	1
excellent	1
vessel	1
with	1
room	1
for	1
more	1
than	1
thirty	1
persons;	1
and	1
to	1
make	1
the	1
transaction	1
safe	1
and	1
lend	1
a	1
colour	1
to	1
it,	1
he	1
thought	1
it	1
well	1
to	1
make,	1
as	1
he	1
did,	1
a	1
voyage	1
to	1
a	1
place	1
called	1
Shershel,	1
twenty	1
leagues	1
from	1
Algiers	1
on	1
the	1
Oran	1
side,	1
where	1
there	1
is	1
an	1
extensive	1
trade	1
in	1
dried	1
figs.	1
Two	1
or	1
three	1
times	1
he	1
made	1
this	1
voyage	1
in	1
company	1
with	1
the	1
Tagarin	1
already	1
mentioned.	1
The	1
Moors	1
of	1
Aragon	1
are	1
called	1
Tagarins	1
in	1
Barbary,	1
and	1
those	1
of	1
Granada	1
Mudéjares;	1
but	1
in	1
the	1
Kingdom	1
of	1
Fez	1
they	1
call	1
the	1
Mudéjares	1
Elches,	1
and	1
they	1
are	1
the	1
people	1
the	1
king	1
chiefly	1
employs	1
in	1
war.	1
To	1
proceed:	1
every	1
time	1
he	1
passed	1
with	1
his	1
vessel	1
he	1
anchored	1
in	1
a	1
cove	1
that	1
was	1
not	1
two	1
crossbow	1
shots	1
from	1
the	1
garden	1
where	1
Zoraida	1
was	1
waiting;	1
and	1
there	1
the	1
renegade,	1
together	1
with	1
the	1
two	1
Moorish	1
lads	1
that	1
rowed,	1
used	1
purposely	1
to	1
station	1
himself,	1
either	1
going	1
through	1
his	1
prayers,	1
or	1
else	1
practising	1
as	1
a	1
part	1
what	1
he	1
meant	1
to	1
perform	1
in	1
earnest.	1
And	1
thus	1
he	1
would	1
go	1
to	1
Zoraida’s	1
garden	1
and	1
ask	1
for	1
fruit,	1
which	1
her	1
father	1
gave	1
him,	1
not	1
knowing	1
him;	1
but	1
though,	1
as	1
he	1
afterwards	1
told	1
me,	1
he	1
sought	1
to	1
speak	1
to	1
Zoraida,	1
and	1
tell	1
her	1
who	1
he	1
was,	1
and	1
that	1
by	1
my	1
orders	1
he	1
was	1
to	1
take	1
her	1
to	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
the	1
Christians,	1
so	1
that	1
she	1
might	1
feel	1
satisfied	1
and	1
easy,	1
he	1
had	1
never	1
been	1
able	1
to	1
do	1
so;	1
for	1
the	1
Moorish	1
women	1
do	1
not	1
allow	1
themselves	1
to	1
be	1
seen	1
by	1
any	1
Moor	1
or	1
Turk,	1
unless	1
their	1
husband	1
or	1
father	1
bid	1
them:	1
with	1
Christian	1
captives	1
they	1
permit	1
freedom	1
of	1
intercourse	1
and	1
communication,	1
even	1
more	1
than	1
might	1
be	1
considered	1
proper.	1
But	1
for	1
my	1
part	1
I	1
should	1
have	1
been	1
sorry	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
spoken	1
to	1
her,	1
for	1
perhaps	1
it	1
might	1
have	1
alarmed	1
her	1
to	1
find	1
her	1
affairs	1
talked	1
of	1
by	1
renegades.	1
But	1
God,	1
who	1
ordered	1
it	1
otherwise,	1
afforded	1
no	1
opportunity	1
for	1
our	1
renegade’s	1
well-meant	1
purpose;	1
and	1
he,	1
seeing	1
how	1
safely	1
he	1
could	1
go	1
to	1
Shershel	1
and	1
return,	1
and	1
anchor	1
when	1
and	1
how	1
and	1
where	1
he	1
liked,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
Tagarin	1
his	1
partner	1
had	1
no	1
will	1
but	1
his,	1
and	1
that,	1
now	1
I	1
was	1
ransomed,	1
all	1
we	1
wanted	1
was	1
to	1
find	1
some	1
Christians	1
to	1
row,	1
told	1
me	1
to	1
look	1
out	1
for	1
any	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
willing	1
to	1
take	1
with	1
me,	1
over	1
and	1
above	1
those	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
ransomed,	1
and	1
to	1
engage	1
them	1
for	1
the	1
next	1
Friday,	1
which	1
he	1
fixed	1
upon	1
for	1
our	1
departure.	1
On	1
this	1
I	1
spoke	1
to	1
twelve	1
Spaniards,	1
all	1
stout	1
rowers,	1
and	1
such	1
as	1
could	1
most	1
easily	1
leave	1
the	1
city;	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
no	1
easy	1
matter	1
to	1
find	1
so	1
many	1
just	1
then,	1
because	1
there	1
were	1
twenty	1
ships	1
out	1
on	1
a	1
cruise	1
and	1
they	1
had	1
taken	1
all	1
the	1
rowers	1
with	1
them;	1
and	1
these	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
been	1
found	1
were	1
it	1
not	1
that	1
their	1
master	1
remained	1
at	1
home	1
that	1
summer	1
without	1
going	1
to	1
sea	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
finish	1
a	1
galliot	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
upon	1
the	1
stocks.	1
To	1
these	1
men	1
I	1
said	1
nothing	1
more	1
than	1
that	1
the	1
next	1
Friday	1
in	1
the	1
evening	1
they	1
were	1
to	1
come	1
out	1
stealthily	1
one	1
by	1
one	1
and	1
hang	1
about	1
Hadji	1
Morato’s	1
garden,	1
waiting	1
for	1
me	1
there	1
until	1
I	1
came.	1
These	1
directions	1
I	1
gave	1
each	1
one	1
separately,	1
with	1
orders	1
that	1
if	1
they	1
saw	1
any	1
other	1
Christians	1
there	1
they	1
were	1
not	1
to	1
say	1
anything	1
to	1
them	1
except	1
that	1
I	1
had	1
directed	1
them	1
to	1
wait	1
at	1
that	1
spot.	1
This	1
preliminary	1
having	1
been	1
settled,	1
another	1
still	1
more	1
necessary	1
step	1
had	1
to	1
be	1
taken,	1
which	1
was	1
to	1
let	1
Zoraida	1
know	1
how	1
matters	1
stood	1
that	1
she	1
might	1
be	1
prepared	1
and	1
forewarned,	1
so	1
as	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
taken	1
by	1
surprise	1
if	1
we	1
were	1
suddenly	1
to	1
seize	1
upon	1
her	1
before	1
she	1
thought	1
the	1
Christians’	1
vessel	1
could	1
have	1
returned.	1
I	1
determined,	1
therefore,	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
garden	1
and	1
try	1
if	1
I	1
could	1
speak	1
to	1
her;	1
and	1
the	1
day	1
before	1
my	1
departure	1
I	1
went	1
there	1
under	1
the	1
pretence	1
of	1
gathering	1
herbs.	1
The	1
first	1
person	1
I	1
met	1
was	1
her	1
father,	1
who	1
addressed	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
language	1
that	1
all	1
over	1
Barbary	1
and	1
even	1
in	1
Constantinople	1
is	1
the	1
medium	1
between	1
captives	1
and	1
Moors,	1
and	1
is	1
neither	1
Morisco	1
nor	1
Castilian,	1
nor	1
of	1
any	1
other	1
nation,	1
but	1
a	1
mixture	1
of	1
all	1
languages,	1
by	1
means	1
of	1
which	1
we	1
can	1
all	1
understand	1
one	1
another.	1
In	1
this	1
sort	1
of	1
language,	1
I	1
say,	1
he	1
asked	1
me	1
what	1
I	1
wanted	1
in	1
his	1
garden,	1
and	1
to	1
whom	1
I	1
belonged.	1
I	1
replied	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
a	1
slave	1
of	1
the	1
Arnaut	1
Mami	1
(for	1
I	1
knew	1
as	1
a	1
certainty	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
very	1
great	1
friend	1
of	1
his),	1
and	1
that	1
I	1
wanted	1
some	1
herbs	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
salad.	1
He	1
asked	1
me	1
then	1
whether	1
I	1
were	1
on	1
ransom	1
or	1
not,	1
and	1
what	1
my	1
master	1
demanded	1
for	1
me.	1
While	1
these	1
questions	1
and	1
answers	1
were	1
proceeding,	1
the	1
fair	1
Zoraida,	1
who	1
had	1
already	1
perceived	1
me	1
some	1
time	1
before,	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
in	1
the	1
garden,	1
and	1
as	1
Moorish	1
women	1
are	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
particular	1
about	1
letting	1
themselves	1
be	1
seen	1
by	1
Christians,	1
or,	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
said	1
before,	1
at	1
all	1
coy,	1
she	1
had	1
no	1
hesitation	1
in	1
coming	1
to	1
where	1
her	1
father	1
stood	1
with	1
me;	1
moreover	1
her	1
father,	1
seeing	1
her	1
approaching	1
slowly,	1
called	1
to	1
her	1
to	1
come.	1
It	1
would	1
be	1
beyond	1
my	1
power	1
now	1
to	1
describe	1
to	1
you	1
the	1
great	1
beauty,	1
the	1
high-bred	1
air,	1
the	1
brilliant	1
attire	1
of	1
my	1
beloved	1
Zoraida	1
as	1
she	1
presented	1
herself	1
before	1
my	1
eyes.	1
I	1
will	1
content	1
myself	1
with	1
saying	1
that	1
more	1
pearls	1
hung	1
from	1
her	1
fair	1
neck,	1
her	1
ears,	1
and	1
her	1
hair	1
than	1
she	1
had	1
hairs	1
on	1
her	1
head.	1
On	1
her	1
ankles,	1
which	1
as	1
is	1
customary	1
were	1
bare,	1
she	1
had	1
carcajes	1
(for	1
so	1
bracelets	1
or	1
anklets	1
are	1
called	1
in	1
Morisco)	1
of	1
the	1
purest	1
gold,	1
set	1
with	1
so	1
many	1
diamonds	1
that	1
she	1
told	1
me	1
afterwards	1
her	1
father	1
valued	1
them	1
at	1
ten	1
thousand	1
doubloons,	1
and	1
those	1
she	1
had	1
on	1
her	1
wrists	1
were	1
worth	1
as	1
much	1
more.	1
The	1
pearls	1
were	1
in	1
profusion	1
and	1
very	1
fine,	1
for	1
the	1
highest	1
display	1
and	1
adornment	1
of	1
the	1
Moorish	1
women	1
is	1
decking	1
themselves	1
with	1
rich	1
pearls	1
and	1
seed-pearls;	1
and	1
of	1
these	1
there	1
are	1
therefore	1
more	1
among	1
the	1
Moors	1
than	1
among	1
any	1
other	1
people.	1
Zoraida’s	1
father	1
had	1
to	1
the	1
reputation	1
of	1
possessing	1
a	1
great	1
number,	1
and	1
the	1
purest	1
in	1
all	1
Algiers,	1
and	1
of	1
possessing	1
also	1
more	1
than	1
two	1
hundred	1
thousand	1
Spanish	1
crowns;	1
and	1
she,	1
who	1
is	1
now	1
mistress	1
of	1
me	1
only,	1
was	1
mistress	1
of	1
all	1
this.	1
Whether	1
thus	1
adorned	1
she	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
beautiful	1
or	1
not,	1
and	1
what	1
she	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
in	1
her	1
prosperity,	1
may	1
be	1
imagined	1
from	1
the	1
beauty	1
remaining	1
to	1
her	1
after	1
so	1
many	1
hardships;	1
for,	1
as	1
everyone	1
knows,	1
the	1
beauty	1
of	1
some	1
women	1
has	1
its	1
times	1
and	1
its	1
seasons,	1
and	1
is	1
increased	1
or	1
diminished	1
by	1
chance	1
causes;	1
and	1
naturally	1
the	1
emotions	1
of	1
the	1
mind	1
will	1
heighten	1
or	1
impair	1
it,	1
though	1
indeed	1
more	1
frequently	1
they	1
totally	1
destroy	1
it.	1
In	1
a	1
word	1
she	1
presented	1
herself	1
before	1
me	1
that	1
day	1
attired	1
with	1
the	1
utmost	1
splendour,	1
and	1
supremely	1
beautiful;	1
at	1
any	1
rate,	1
she	1
seemed	1
to	1
me	1
the	1
most	1
beautiful	1
object	1
I	1
had	1
ever	1
seen;	1
and	1
when,	1
besides,	1
I	1
thought	1
of	1
all	1
I	1
owed	1
to	1
her	1
I	1
felt	1
as	1
though	1
I	1
had	1
before	1
me	1
some	1
heavenly	1
being	1
come	1
to	1
earth	1
to	1
bring	1
me	1
relief	1
and	1
happiness.	1
As	1
she	1
approached	1
her	1
father	1
told	1
her	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
language	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
a	1
captive	1
belonging	1
to	1
his	1
friend	1
the	1
Arnaut	1
Mami,	1
and	1
that	1
I	1
had	1
come	1
for	1
salad.	1
She	1
took	1
up	1
the	1
conversation,	1
and	1
in	1
that	1
mixture	1
of	1
tongues	1
I	1
have	1
spoken	1
of	1
she	1
asked	1
me	1
if	1
I	1
was	1
a	1
gentleman,	1
and	1
why	1
I	1
was	1
not	1
ransomed.	1
I	1
answered	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
already	1
ransomed,	1
and	1
that	1
by	1
the	1
price	1
it	1
might	1
be	1
seen	1
what	1
value	1
my	1
master	1
set	1
on	1
me,	1
as	1
they	1
had	1
given	1
one	1
thousand	1
five	1
hundred	1
zoltanis	1
for	1
me;	1
to	1
which	1
she	1
replied,	1
“Hadst	1
thou	1
been	1
my	1
father’s,	1
I	1
can	1
tell	1
thee,	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
let	1
him	1
part	1
with	1
thee	1
for	1
twice	1
as	1
much,	1
for	1
you	1
Christians	1
always	1
tell	1
lies	1
about	1
yourselves	1
and	1
make	1
yourselves	1
out	1
poor	1
to	1
cheat	1
the	1
Moors.”	1
“That	1
may	1
be,	1
lady,”	1
said	1
I;	1
“but	1
indeed	1
I	1
dealt	1
truthfully	1
with	1
my	1
master,	1
as	1
I	1
do	1
and	1
mean	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
everybody	1
in	1
the	1
world.”	1
“And	1
when	1
dost	1
thou	1
go?”	1
said	1
Zoraida.	1
“To-morrow,	1
I	1
think,”	1
said	1
I,	1
“for	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
vessel	1
here	1
from	1
France	1
which	1
sails	1
to-morrow,	1
and	1
I	1
think	1
I	1
shall	1
go	1
in	1
her.”	1
“Would	1
it	1
not	1
be	1
better,”	1
said	1
Zoraida,	1
“to	1
wait	1
for	1
the	1
arrival	1
of	1
ships	1
from	1
Spain	1
and	1
go	1
with	1
them	1
and	1
not	1
with	1
the	1
French	1
who	1
are	1
not	1
your	1
friends?”	1
“No,”	1
said	1
I;	1
“though	1
if	1
there	1
were	1
intelligence	1
that	1
a	1
vessel	1
were	1
now	1
coming	1
from	1
Spain	1
it	1
is	1
true	1
I	1
might,	1
perhaps,	1
wait	1
for	1
it;	1
however,	1
it	1
is	1
more	1
likely	1
I	1
shall	1
depart	1
to-morrow,	1
for	1
the	1
longing	1
I	1
feel	1
to	1
return	1
to	1
my	1
country	1
and	1
to	1
those	1
I	1
love	1
is	1
so	1
great	1
that	1
it	1
will	1
not	1
allow	1
me	1
to	1
wait	1
for	1
another	1
opportunity,	1
however	1
more	1
convenient,	1
if	1
it	1
be	1
delayed.”	1
“No	1
doubt	1
thou	1
art	1
married	1
in	1
thine	1
own	1
country,”	1
said	1
Zoraida,	1
“and	1
for	1
that	1
reason	1
thou	1
art	1
anxious	1
to	1
go	1
and	1
see	1
thy	1
wife.”	1
“I	1
am	1
not	1
married,”	1
I	1
replied,	1
“but	1
I	1
have	1
given	1
my	1
promise	1
to	1
marry	1
on	1
my	1
arrival	1
there.”	1
“And	1
is	1
the	1
lady	1
beautiful	1
to	1
whom	1
thou	1
hast	1
given	1
it?”	1
said	1
Zoraida.	1
“So	1
beautiful,”	1
said	1
I,	1
“that,	1
to	1
describe	1
her	1
worthily	1
and	1
tell	1
thee	1
the	1
truth,	1
she	1
is	1
very	1
like	1
thee.”	1
At	1
this	1
her	1
father	1
laughed	1
very	1
heartily	1
and	1
said,	1
“By	1
Allah,	1
Christian,	1
she	1
must	1
be	1
very	1
beautiful	1
if	1
she	1
is	1
like	1
my	1
daughter,	1
who	1
is	1
the	1
most	1
beautiful	1
woman	1
in	1
all	1
this	1
kingdom:	1
only	1
look	1
at	1
her	1
well	1
and	1
thou	1
wilt	1
see	1
I	1
am	1
telling	1
the	1
truth.”	1
Zoraida’s	1
father	1
as	1
the	1
better	1
linguist	1
helped	1
to	1
interpret	1
most	1
of	1
these	1
words	1
and	1
phrases,	1
for	1
though	1
she	1
spoke	1
the	1
bastard	1
language,	1
that,	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
said,	1
is	1
employed	1
there,	1
she	1
expressed	1
her	1
meaning	1
more	1
by	1
signs	1
than	1
by	1
words.	1
While	1
we	1
were	1
still	1
engaged	1
in	1
this	1
conversation,	1
a	1
Moor	1
came	1
running	1
up,	1
exclaiming	1
that	1
four	1
Turks	1
had	1
leaped	1
over	1
the	1
fence	1
or	1
wall	1
of	1
the	1
garden,	1
and	1
were	1
gathering	1
the	1
fruit	1
though	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
yet	1
ripe.	1
The	1
old	1
man	1
was	1
alarmed	1
and	1
Zoraida	1
too,	1
for	1
the	1
Moors	1
commonly,	1
and,	1
so	1
to	1
speak,	1
instinctively	1
have	1
a	1
dread	1
of	1
the	1
Turks,	1
but	1
particularly	1
of	1
the	1
soldiers,	1
who	1
are	1
so	1
insolent	1
and	1
domineering	1
to	1
the	1
Moors	1
who	1
are	1
under	1
their	1
power	1
that	1
they	1
treat	1
them	1
worse	1
than	1
if	1
they	1
were	1
their	1
slaves.	1
Her	1
father	1
said	1
to	1
Zoraida,	1
“Daughter,	1
retire	1
into	1
the	1
house	1
and	1
shut	1
thyself	1
in	1
while	1
I	1
go	1
and	1
speak	1
to	1
these	1
dogs;	1
and	1
thou,	1
Christian,	1
pick	1
thy	1
herbs,	1
and	1
go	1
in	1
peace,	1
and	1
Allah	1
bring	1
thee	1
safe	1
to	1
thy	1
own	1
country.”	1
I	1
bowed,	1
and	1
he	1
went	1
away	1
to	1
look	1
for	1
the	1
Turks,	1
leaving	1
me	1
alone	1
with	1
Zoraida,	1
who	1
made	1
as	1
if	1
she	1
were	1
about	1
to	1
retire	1
as	1
her	1
father	1
bade	1
her;	1
but	1
the	1
moment	1
he	1
was	1
concealed	1
by	1
the	1
trees	1
of	1
the	1
garden,	1
turning	1
to	1
me	1
with	1
her	1
eyes	1
full	1
of	1
tears	1
she	1
said,	1
“Tameji,	1
cristiano,	1
tameji?”	1
that	1
is	1
to	1
say,	1
“Art	1
thou	1
going,	1
Christian,	1
art	1
thou	1
going?”	1
I	1
made	1
answer,	1
“Yes,	1
lady,	1
but	1
not	1
without	1
thee,	1
come	1
what	1
may:	1
be	1
on	1
the	1
watch	1
for	1
me	1
on	1
the	1
next	1
Juma,	1
and	1
be	1
not	1
alarmed	1
when	1
thou	1
seest	1
us;	1
for	1
most	1
surely	1
we	1
shall	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
the	1
Christians.”	1
This	1
I	1
said	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
way	1
that	1
she	1
understood	1
perfectly	1
all	1
that	1
passed	1
between	1
us,	1
and	1
throwing	1
her	1
arm	1
round	1
my	1
neck	1
she	1
began	1
with	1
feeble	1
steps	1
to	1
move	1
towards	1
the	1
house;	1
but	1
as	1
fate	1
would	1
have	1
it	1
(and	1
it	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
very	1
unfortunate	1
if	1
Heaven	1
had	1
not	1
otherwise	1
ordered	1
it),	1
just	1
as	1
we	1
were	1
moving	1
on	1
in	1
the	1
manner	1
and	1
position	1
I	1
have	1
described,	1
with	1
her	1
arm	1
round	1
my	1
neck,	1
her	1
father,	1
as	1
he	1
returned	1
after	1
having	1
sent	1
away	1
the	1
Turks,	1
saw	1
how	1
we	1
were	1
walking	1
and	1
we	1
perceived	1
that	1
he	1
saw	1
us;	1
but	1
Zoraida,	1
ready	1
and	1
quickwitted,	1
took	1
care	1
not	1
to	1
remove	1
her	1
arm	1
from	1
my	1
neck,	1
but	1
on	1
the	1
contrary	1
drew	1
closer	1
to	1
me	1
and	1
laid	1
her	1
head	1
on	1
my	1
breast,	1
bending	1
her	1
knees	1
a	1
little	1
and	1
showing	1
all	1
the	1
signs	1
and	1
tokens	1
of	1
fainting,	1
while	1
I	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
made	1
it	1
seem	1
as	1
though	1
I	1
were	1
supporting	1
her	1
against	1
my	1
will.	1
Her	1
father	1
came	1
running	1
up	1
to	1
where	1
we	1
were,	1
and	1
seeing	1
his	1
daughter	1
in	1
this	1
state	1
asked	1
what	1
was	1
the	1
matter	1
with	1
her;	1
she,	1
however,	1
giving	1
no	1
answer,	1
he	1
said,	1
“No	1
doubt	1
she	1
has	1
fainted	1
in	1
alarm	1
at	1
the	1
entrance	1
of	1
those	1
dogs,”	1
and	1
taking	1
her	1
from	1
mine	1
he	1
drew	1
her	1
to	1
his	1
own	1
breast,	1
while	1
she	1
sighing,	1
her	1
eyes	1
still	1
wet	1
with	1
tears,	1
said	1
again,	1
“Ameji,	1
cristiano,	1
ameji”—“Go,	1
Christian,	1
go.”	1
To	1
this	1
her	1
father	1
replied,	1
“There	1
is	1
no	1
need,	1
daughter,	1
for	1
the	1
Christian	1
to	1
go,	1
for	1
he	1
has	1
done	1
thee	1
no	1
harm,	1
and	1
the	1
Turks	1
have	1
now	1
gone;	1
feel	1
no	1
alarm,	1
there	1
is	1
nothing	1
to	1
hurt	1
thee,	1
for	1
as	1
I	1
say,	1
the	1
Turks	1
at	1
my	1
request	1
have	1
gone	1
back	1
the	1
way	1
they	1
came.”	1

“It	1
was	1
they	1
who	1
terrified	1
her,	1
as	1
thou	1
hast	1
said,	1
señor,”	1
said	1
I	1
to	1
her	1
father;	1
“but	1
since	1
she	1
tells	1
me	1
to	1
go,	1
I	1

no	1

with	1
thy	1
leave	1
I	1
will	1
come	1
back	1
to	1
this	1
garden	1
for	1
herbs	1
if	1
need	1
be,	1
for	1
my	1
master	1
says	1
there	1
are	1
nowhere	1
better	1
herbs	1
for	1
salad	1
than	1
here.”	1
“Come	1
back	1
for	1
any	1
thou	1
hast	1
need	1
of,”	1
replied	1
Hadji	1
Morato;	1
“for	1
my	1
daughter	1
does	1
not	1
speak	1
thus	1
because	1
she	1
is	1
displeased	1
with	1
thee	1
or	1
any	1
Christian:	1
she	1
only	1
meant	1
that	1
the	1
Turks	1
should	1
go,	1
not	1
thou;	1
or	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
time	1
for	1
thee	1
to	1
look	1
for	1
thy	1
herbs.”	1
With	1
this	1
I	1
at	1
once	1
took	1
my	1
leave	1
of	1
both;	1
and	1
she,	1
looking	1
as	1
though	1
her	1
heart	1
were	1
breaking,	1
retired	1
with	1
her	1
father.	1
While	1
pretending	1
to	1
look	1
for	1
herbs	1
I	1
made	1
the	1
round	1
of	1
the	1
garden	1
at	1
my	1
ease,	1
and	1
studied	1
carefully	1
all	1
the	1
approaches	1
and	1
outlets,	1
and	1
the	1
fastenings	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
and	1
everything	1
that	1
could	1
be	1
taken	1
advantage	1
of	1
to	1
make	1
our	1
task	1
easy.	1

Having	1
done	1
so	1
I	1
went	1
and	1
gave	1
an	1
account	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
had	1
taken	1
place	1
to	1
the	1
renegade	1
and	1
my	1
comrades,	1
and	1
looked	1
forward	1
with	1
impatience	1
to	1
the	1
hour	1
when,	1
all	1
fear	1
at	1
an	1
end,	1
I	1
should	1
find	1
myself	1
in	1
possession	1
of	1
the	1
prize	1
which	1
fortune	1
held	1
out	1
to	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
fair	1
and	1
lovely	1
Zoraida.	1
The	1
time	1
passed	1
at	1
length,	1
and	1
the	1
appointed	1
day	1
we	1
so	1
longed	1
for	1
arrived;	1
and,	1
all	1
following	1
out	1
the	1
arrangement	1
and	1
plan	1
which,	1
after	1
careful	1
consideration	1
and	1
many	1
a	1
long	1
discussion,	1
we	1
had	1
decided	1
upon,	1
we	1
succeeded	1
as	1
fully	1
as	1
we	1
could	1
have	1
wished;	1
for	1
on	1
the	1
Friday	1
following	1
the	1
day	1
upon	1
which	1
I	1
spoke	1
to	1
Zoraida	1
in	1
the	1
garden,	1
the	1
renegade	1
anchored	1
his	1
vessel	1
at	1
nightfall	1
almost	1
opposite	1
the	1
spot	1
where	1
she	1
was.	1
The	1
Christians	1
who	1
were	1
to	1
row	1
were	1
ready	1
and	1
in	1
hiding	1
in	1
different	1
places	1
round	1
about,	1
all	1
waiting	1
for	1
me,	1
anxious	1
and	1
elated,	1
and	1
eager	1
to	1
attack	1
the	1
vessel	1
they	1
had	1
before	1
their	1
eyes;	1
for	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
the	1
renegade’s	1
plan,	1
but	1
expected	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
to	1
gain	1
their	1
liberty	1
by	1
force	1
of	1
arms	1
and	1
by	1
killing	1
the	1
Moors	1
who	1
were	1
on	1
board	1
the	1
vessel.	1
As	1
soon,	1
then,	1
as	1
I	1
and	1
my	1
comrades	1
made	1
our	1
appearance,	1
all	1
those	1
that	1
were	1
in	1
hiding	1
seeing	1
us	1
came	1
and	1
joined	1
us.	1
It	1
was	1
now	1
the	1
time	1
when	1
the	1
city	1
gates	1
are	1
shut,	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
one	1
to	1
be	1
seen	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
space	1
outside.	1
When	1
we	1
were	1
collected	1
together	1
we	1
debated	1
whether	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
better	1
first	1
to	1
go	1
for	1
Zoraida,	1
or	1
to	1
make	1
prisoners	1
of	1
the	1
Moorish	1
rowers	1
who	1
rowed	1
in	1
the	1
vessel;	1
but	1
while	1
we	1
were	1
still	1
uncertain	1
our	1
renegade	1
came	1
up	1
asking	1
us	1
what	1
kept	1
us,	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
now	1
the	1
time,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
Moors	1
were	1
off	1
their	1
guard	1
and	1
most	1
of	1
them	1
asleep.	1
We	1
told	1
him	1
why	1
we	1
hesitated,	1
but	1
he	1
said	1
it	1
was	1
of	1
more	1
importance	1
first	1
to	1
secure	1
the	1
vessel,	1
which	1
could	1
be	1
done	1
with	1
the	1
greatest	1
ease	1
and	1
without	1
any	1
danger,	1
and	1
then	1
we	1
could	1
go	1
for	1
Zoraida.	1
We	1
all	1
approved	1
of	1
what	1
he	1
said,	1
and	1
so	1
without	1
further	1
delay,	1
guided	1
by	1
him	1
we	1
made	1
for	1
the	1
vessel,	1
and	1
he	1
leaping	1
on	1
board	1
first,	1
drew	1
his	1
cutlass	1
and	1
said	1
in	1
Morisco,	1
“Let	1
no	1
one	1
stir	1
from	1
this	1
if	1
he	1
does	1
not	1
want	1
it	1
to	1
cost	1
him	1
his	1
life.”	1
By	1
this	1
almost	1
all	1
the	1
Christians	1
were	1
on	1
board,	1
and	1
the	1
Moors,	1
who	1
were	1
fainthearted,	1
hearing	1
their	1
captain	1
speak	1
in	1
this	1
way,	1
were	1
cowed,	1
and	1
without	1
any	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
taking	1
to	1
his	1
arms	1
(and	1
indeed	1
they	1
had	1
few	1
or	1
hardly	1
any)	1
they	1
submitted	1
without	1
saying	1
a	1
word	1
to	1
be	1
bound	1
by	1
the	1
Christians,	1
who	1
quickly	1
secured	1
them,	1
threatening	1
them	1
that	1
if	1
they	1
raised	1
any	1
kind	1
of	1
outcry	1
they	1
would	1
be	1
all	1
put	1
to	1
the	1
sword.	1
This	1
having	1
been	1
accomplished,	1
and	1
half	1
of	1
our	1
party	1
being	1
left	1
to	1
keep	1
guard	1
over	1
them,	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
us,	1
again	1
taking	1
the	1
renegade	1
as	1
our	1
guide,	1
hastened	1
towards	1
Hadji	1
Morato’s	1
garden,	1
and	1
as	1
good	1
luck	1
would	1
have	1
it,	1
on	1
trying	1
the	1
gate	1
it	1
opened	1
as	1
easily	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
locked;	1
and	1
so,	1
quite	1
quietly	1
and	1
in	1
silence,	1
we	1
reached	1
the	1
house	1
without	1
being	1
perceived	1
by	1
anybody.	1
The	1
lovely	1
Zoraida	1
was	1
watching	1
for	1
us	1
at	1
a	1
window,	1
and	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
she	1
perceived	1
that	1
there	1
were	1
people	1
there,	1
she	1
asked	1
in	1
a	1
low	1
voice	1
if	1
we	1
were	1
“Nizarani,”	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
to	1
say	1
or	1
ask	1
if	1
we	1
were	1
Christians.	1
I	1
answered	1
that	1
we	1
were,	1
and	1
begged	1
her	1
to	1
come	1
down.	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
she	1
recognised	1
me	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
delay	1
an	1
instant,	1
but	1
without	1
answering	1
a	1
word	1
came	1
down	1
immediately,	1
opened	1
the	1
door	1
and	1
presented	1
herself	1
before	1
us	1
all,	1
so	1
beautiful	1
and	1
so	1
richly	1
attired	1
that	1
I	1
cannot	1
attempt	1
to	1
describe	1
her.	1
The	1
moment	1
I	1
saw	1
her	1
I	1
took	1
her	1
hand	1
and	1
kissed	1
it,	1
and	1
the	1
renegade	1
and	1
my	1
two	1
comrades	1
did	1
the	1
same;	1
and	1
the	1
rest,	1
who	1
knew	1
nothing	1
of	1
the	1
circumstances,	1
did	1
as	1
they	1
saw	1
us	1
do,	1
for	1
it	1
only	1
seemed	1
as	1
if	1
we	1
were	1
returning	1
thanks	1
to	1
her,	1
and	1
recognising	1
her	1
as	1
the	1
giver	1
of	1
our	1
liberty.	1
The	1
renegade	1
asked	1
her	1
in	1
the	1
Morisco	1
language	1
if	1
her	1
father	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
house.	1
She	1
replied	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
asleep.	1
“Then	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
necessary	1
to	1
waken	1
him	1
and	1
take	1
him	1
with	1
us,”	1
said	1
the	1
renegade,	1
“and	1
everything	1
of	1
value	1
in	1
this	1
fair	1
mansion.”	1
“Nay,”	1
said	1
she,	1
“my	1
father	1
must	1
not	1
on	1
any	1
account	1
be	1
touched,	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
nothing	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
except	1
what	1
I	1
shall	1
take,	1
and	1
that	1
will	1
be	1
quite	1
enough	1
to	1
enrich	1
and	1
satisfy	1
all	1
of	1
you;	1
wait	1
a	1
little	1
and	1
you	1
shall	1
see,”	1
and	1
so	1
saying	1
she	1
went	1
in,	1
telling	1
us	1
she	1
would	1
return	1
immediately	1
and	1
bidding	1
us	1
keep	1
quiet	1
without	1
making	1
any	1
noise.	1
I	1
asked	1
the	1
renegade	1
what	1
had	1
passed	1
between	1
them,	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
told	1
me,	1
I	1
declared	1
that	1
nothing	1
should	1
be	1
done	1
except	1
in	1
accordance	1
with	1
the	1
wishes	1
of	1
Zoraida,	1
who	1
now	1
came	1
back	1
with	1
a	1
little	1
trunk	1
so	1
full	1
of	1
gold	1
crowns	1
that	1
she	1
could	1
scarcely	1
carry	1
it.	1
Unfortunately	1
her	1
father	1
awoke	1
while	1
this	1
was	1
going	1
on,	1
and	1
hearing	1
a	1
noise	1
in	1
the	1
garden,	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
window,	1
and	1
at	1
once	1
perceiving	1
that	1
all	1
those	1
who	1
were	1
there	1
were	1
Christians,	1
raising	1
a	1
prodigiously	1
loud	1
outcry,	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
call	1
out	1
in	1
Arabic,	1
“Christians,	1
Christians!	1
thieves,	1
thieves!”	1
by	1
which	1
cries	1
we	1
were	1
all	1
thrown	1
into	1
the	1
greatest	1
fear	1
and	1
embarrassment;	1
but	1
the	1
renegade	1
seeing	1
the	1
danger	1
we	1
were	1
in	1
and	1
how	1
important	1
it	1
was	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
effect	1
his	1
purpose	1
before	1
we	1
were	1
heard,	1
mounted	1
with	1
the	1
utmost	1
quickness	1
to	1
where	1
Hadji	1
Morato	1
was,	1
and	1
with	1
him	1
went	1
some	1
of	1
our	1
party;	1
I,	1
however,	1
did	1
not	1
dare	1
to	1
leave	1
Zoraida,	1
who	1
had	1
fallen	1
almost	1
fainting	1
in	1
my	1
arms.	1
To	1
be	1
brief,	1
those	1
who	1
had	1
gone	1
upstairs	1
acted	1
so	1
promptly	1
that	1
in	1
an	1
instant	1
they	1
came	1
down,	1
carrying	1
Hadji	1
Morato	1
with	1
his	1
hands	1
bound	1
and	1
a	1
napkin	1
tied	1
over	1
his	1
mouth,	1
which	1
prevented	1
him	1
from	1
uttering	1
a	1
word,	1
warning	1
him	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
that	1
to	1
attempt	1
to	1
speak	1
would	1
cost	1
him	1
his	1
life.	1
When	1
his	1
daughter	1
caught	1
sight	1
of	1
him	1
she	1
covered	1
her	1
eyes	1
so	1
as	1
not	1
to	1
see	1
him,	1
and	1
her	1
father	1
was	1
horror-stricken,	1
not	1
knowing	1
how	1
willingly	1
she	1
had	1
placed	1
herself	1
in	1
our	1
hands.	1
But	1
it	1
was	1
now	1
most	1
essential	1
for	1
us	1
to	1
be	1
on	1
the	1
move,	1
and	1
carefully	1
and	1
quickly	1
we	1
regained	1
the	1
vessel,	1
where	1
those	1
who	1
had	1
remained	1
on	1
board	1
were	1
waiting	1
for	1
us	1
in	1
apprehension	1
of	1
some	1
mishap	1
having	1
befallen	1
us.	1
It	1
was	1
barely	1
two	1
hours	1
after	1
night	1
set	1
in	1
when	1
we	1
were	1
all	1
on	1
board	1
the	1
vessel,	1
where	1
the	1
cords	1
were	1
removed	1
from	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
Zoraida’s	1
father,	1
and	1
the	1
napkin	1
from	1
his	1
mouth;	1
but	1
the	1
renegade	1
once	1
more	1
told	1
him	1
not	1
to	1
utter	1
a	1
word,	1
or	1
they	1
would	1
take	1
his	1
life.	1
He,	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
his	1
daughter	1
there,	1
began	1
to	1
sigh	1
piteously,	1
and	1
still	1
more	1
when	1
he	1
perceived	1
that	1
I	1
held	1
her	1
closely	1
embraced	1
and	1
that	1
she	1
lay	1
quiet	1
without	1
resisting	1
or	1
complaining,	1
or	1
showing	1
any	1
reluctance;	1
nevertheless	1
he	1
remained	1
silent	1
lest	1
they	1
should	1
carry	1
into	1
effect	1
the	1
repeated	1
threats	1
the	1
renegade	1
had	1
addressed	1
to	1
him.	1
Finding	1
herself	1
now	1
on	1
board,	1
and	1
that	1
we	1
were	1
about	1
to	1
give	1
way	1
with	1
the	1
oars,	1
Zoraida,	1
seeing	1
her	1
father	1
there,	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
Moors	1
bound,	1
bade	1
the	1
renegade	1
ask	1
me	1
to	1
do	1
her	1
the	1
favour	1
of	1
releasing	1
the	1
Moors	1
and	1
setting	1
her	1
father	1
at	1
liberty,	1
for	1
she	1
would	1
rather	1
drown	1
herself	1
in	1
the	1
sea	1
than	1
suffer	1
a	1
father	1
that	1
had	1
loved	1
her	1
so	1
dearly	1
to	1
be	1
carried	1
away	1
captive	1
before	1
her	1
eyes	1
and	1
on	1
her	1
account.	1
The	1
renegade	1
repeated	1
this	1
to	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
replied	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
very	1
willing	1
to	1
do	1
so;	1
but	1
he	1
replied	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
advisable,	1
because	1
if	1
they	1
were	1
left	1
there	1
they	1
would	1
at	1
once	1
raise	1
the	1
country	1
and	1
stir	1
up	1
the	1
city,	1
and	1
lead	1
to	1
the	1
despatch	1
of	1
swift	1
cruisers	1
in	1
pursuit,	1
and	1
our	1
being	1
taken,	1
by	1
sea	1
or	1
land,	1
without	1
any	1
possibility	1
of	1
escape;	1
and	1
that	1
all	1
that	1
could	1
be	1
done	1
was	1
to	1
set	1
them	1
free	1
on	1
the	1
first	1
Christian	1
ground	1
we	1
reached.	1
On	1
this	1
point	1
we	1
all	1
agreed;	1
and	1
Zoraida,	1
to	1
whom	1
it	1
was	1
explained,	1
together	1
with	1
the	1
reasons	1
that	1
prevented	1
us	1
from	1
doing	1
at	1
once	1
what	1
she	1
desired,	1
was	1
satisfied	1
likewise;	1
and	1
then	1
in	1
glad	1
silence	1
and	1
with	1
cheerful	1
alacrity	1
each	1
of	1
our	1
stout	1
rowers	1
took	1
his	1
oar,	1
and	1
commending	1
ourselves	1
to	1
God	1
with	1
all	1
our	1
hearts,	1
we	1
began	1
to	1
shape	1
our	1
course	1
for	1
the	1
island	1
of	1
Majorca,	1
the	1
nearest	1
Christian	1
land.	1
Owing,	1
however,	1
to	1
the	1
Tramontana	1
rising	1
a	1
little,	1
and	1
the	1
sea	1
growing	1
somewhat	1
rough,	1
it	1
was	1
impossible	1
for	1
us	1
to	1
keep	1
a	1
straight	1
course	1
for	1
Majorca,	1
and	1
we	1
were	1
compelled	1
to	1
coast	1
in	1
the	1
direction	1
of	1
Oran,	1
not	1
without	1
great	1
uneasiness	1
on	1
our	1
part	1
lest	1
we	1
should	1
be	1
observed	1
from	1
the	1
town	1
of	1
Shershel,	1
which	1
lies	1
on	1
that	1
coast,	1
not	1
more	1
than	1
sixty	1
miles	1
from	1
Algiers.	1
Moreover	1
we	1
were	1
afraid	1
of	1
meeting	1
on	1
that	1
course	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
galliots	1
that	1
usually	1
come	1
with	1
goods	1
from	1
Tetuan;	1
although	1
each	1
of	1
us	1
for	1
himself	1
and	1
all	1
of	1
us	1
together	1
felt	1
confident	1
that,	1
if	1
we	1
were	1
to	1
meet	1
a	1
merchant	1
galliot,	1
so	1
that	1
it	1
were	1
not	1
a	1
cruiser,	1
not	1
only	1
should	1
we	1
not	1
be	1
lost,	1
but	1
that	1
we	1
should	1
take	1
a	1
vessel	1
in	1
which	1
we	1
could	1
more	1
safely	1
accomplish	1
our	1
voyage.	1
As	1
we	1
pursued	1
our	1
course	1
Zoraida	1
kept	1
her	1
head	1
between	1
my	1
hands	1
so	1
as	1
not	1
to	1
see	1
her	1
father,	1
and	1
I	1
felt	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
praying	1
to	1
Lela	1
Marien	1
to	1
help	1
us.	1

We	1
might	1
have	1
made	1
about	1
thirty	1
miles	1
when	1
daybreak	1
found	1
us	1
some	1
three	1
musket-shots	1
off	1
the	1
land,	1
which	1
seemed	1
to	1
us	1
deserted,	1
and	1
without	1
anyone	1
to	1
see	1
us.	1
For	1
all	1
that,	1
however,	1
by	1
hard	1
rowing	1
we	1
put	1
out	1
a	1
little	1
to	1
sea,	1
for	1
it	1
was	1
now	1
somewhat	1
calmer,	1
and	1
having	1
gained	1
about	1
two	1
leagues	1
the	1
word	1
was	1
given	1
to	1
row	1
by	1
batches,	1
while	1
we	1
ate	1
something,	1
for	1
the	1
vessel	1
was	1
well	1
provided;	1
but	1
the	1
rowers	1
said	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
time	1
to	1
take	1
any	1
rest;	1
let	1
food	1
be	1
served	1
out	1
to	1
those	1
who	1
were	1
not	1
rowing,	1
but	1
they	1
would	1
not	1
leave	1
their	1
oars	1
on	1
any	1
account.	1
This	1
was	1
done,	1
but	1
now	1
a	1
stiff	1
breeze	1
began	1
to	1
blow,	1
which	1
obliged	1
us	1
to	1
leave	1
off	1
rowing	1
and	1
make	1
sail	1
at	1
once	1
and	1
steer	1
for	1
Oran,	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
impossible	1
to	1
make	1
any	1
other	1
course.	1
All	1
this	1
was	1
done	1
very	1
promptly,	1
and	1
under	1
sail	1
we	1
ran	1
more	1
than	1
eight	1
miles	1
an	1
hour	1
without	1
any	1
fear,	1
except	1
that	1
of	1
coming	1
across	1
some	1
vessel	1
out	1
on	1
a	1
roving	1
expedition.	1
We	1
gave	1
the	1
Moorish	1
rowers	1
some	1
food,	1
and	1
the	1
renegade	1
comforted	1
them	1
by	1
telling	1
them	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
not	1
held	1
as	1
captives,	1
as	1
we	1
should	1
set	1
them	1
free	1
on	1
the	1
first	1
opportunity.	1
The	1
same	1
was	1
said	1
to	1
Zoraida’s	1
father,	1
who	1
replied,	1
“Anything	1
else,	1
Christian,	1
I	1
might	1
hope	1
for	1
or	1
think	1
likely	1
from	1
your	1
generosity	1
and	1
good	1
behaviour,	1
but	1
do	1
not	1
think	1
me	1
so	1
simple	1
as	1
to	1
imagine	1
you	1
will	1
give	1
me	1
my	1
liberty;	1
for	1
you	1
would	1
have	1
never	1
exposed	1
yourselves	1
to	1
the	1
danger	1
of	1
depriving	1
me	1
of	1
it	1
only	1
to	1
restore	1
it	1
to	1
me	1
so	1
generously,	1
especially	1
as	1
you	1
know	1
who	1
I	1
am	1
and	1
the	1
sum	1
you	1
may	1
expect	1
to	1
receive	1
on	1
restoring	1
it;	1
and	1
if	1
you	1
will	1
only	1
name	1
that,	1
I	1
here	1
offer	1
you	1
all	1
you	1
require	1
for	1
myself	1
and	1
for	1
my	1
unhappy	1
daughter	1
there;	1
or	1
else	1
for	1
her	1
alone,	1
for	1
she	1
is	1
the	1
greatest	1
and	1
most	1
precious	1
part	1
of	1
my	1
soul.”	1
As	1
he	1
said	1
this	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
weep	1
so	1
bitterly	1
that	1
he	1
filled	1
us	1
all	1
with	1
compassion	1
and	1
forced	1
Zoraida	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
him,	1
and	1
when	1
she	1
saw	1
him	1
weeping	1
she	1
was	1
so	1
moved	1
that	1
she	1
rose	1
from	1
my	1
feet	1
and	1
ran	1
to	1
throw	1
her	1
arms	1
round	1
him,	1
and	1
pressing	1
her	1
face	1
to	1
his,	1
they	1
both	1
gave	1
way	1
to	1
such	1
an	1
outburst	1
of	1
tears	1
that	1
several	1
of	1
us	1
were	1
constrained	1
to	1
keep	1
them	1
company.	1
But	1
when	1
her	1
father	1
saw	1
her	1
in	1
full	1
dress	1
and	1
with	1
all	1
her	1
jewels	1
about	1
her,	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
her	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
language,	1
“What	1
means	1
this,	1
my	1
daughter?	1
Last	1
night,	1
before	1
this	1
terrible	1
misfortune	1
in	1
which	1
we	1
are	1
plunged	1
befell	1
us,	1
I	1
saw	1
thee	1
in	1
thy	1
everyday	1
and	1
indoor	1
garments;	1
and	1
now,	1
without	1
having	1
had	1
time	1
to	1
attire	1
thyself,	1
and	1
without	1
my	1
bringing	1
thee	1
any	1
joyful	1
tidings	1
to	1
furnish	1
an	1
occasion	1
for	1
adorning	1
and	1
bedecking	1
thyself,	1
I	1
see	1
thee	1
arrayed	1
in	1
the	1
finest	1
attire	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
in	1
my	1
power	1
to	1
give	1
thee	1
when	1
fortune	1
was	1
most	1
kind	1
to	1
us.	1
Answer	1
me	1
this;	1
for	1
it	1
causes	1
me	1
greater	1
anxiety	1
and	1
surprise	1
than	1
even	1
this	1
misfortune	1
itself.”	1
The	1
renegade	1
interpreted	1
to	1
us	1
what	1
the	1
Moor	1
said	1
to	1
his	1
daughter;	1
she,	1
however,	1
returned	1
him	1
no	1
answer.	1
But	1
when	1
he	1
observed	1
in	1
one	1
corner	1
of	1
the	1
vessel	1
the	1
little	1
trunk	1
in	1
which	1
she	1
used	1
to	1
keep	1
her	1
jewels,	1
which	1
he	1
well	1
knew	1
he	1
had	1
left	1
in	1
Algiers	1
and	1
had	1
not	1
brought	1
to	1
the	1
garden,	1
he	1
was	1
still	1
more	1
amazed,	1
and	1
asked	1
her	1
how	1
that	1
trunk	1
had	1
come	1
into	1
our	1
hands,	1
and	1
what	1
there	1
was	1
in	1
it.	1
To	1
which	1
the	1
renegade,	1
without	1
waiting	1
for	1
Zoraida	1
to	1
reply,	1
made	1
answer,	1
“Do	1
not	1
trouble	1
thyself	1
by	1
asking	1
thy	1
daughter	1
Zoraida	1
so	1
many	1
questions,	1
señor,	1
for	1
the	1
one	1
answer	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
thee	1
will	1
serve	1
for	1
all;	1
I	1
would	1
have	1
thee	1
know	1
that	1
she	1
is	1
a	1
Christian,	1
and	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
she	1
who	1
has	1
been	1
the	1
file	1
for	1
our	1
chains	1
and	1
our	1
deliverer	1
from	1
captivity.	1
She	1
is	1
here	1
of	1
her	1
own	1
free	1
will,	1
as	1
glad,	1
I	1
imagine,	1
to	1
find	1
herself	1
in	1
this	1
position	1
as	1
he	1
who	1
escapes	1
from	1
darkness	1
into	1
the	1
light,	1
from	1
death	1
to	1
life,	1
and	1
from	1
suffering	1
to	1
glory.”	1
“Daughter,	1
is	1
this	1
true,	1
what	1
he	1
says?”	1
cried	1
the	1
Moor.	1
“It	1
is,”	1
replied	1
Zoraida.	1
“That	1
thou	1
art	1
in	1
truth	1
a	1
Christian,”	1
said	1
the	1
old	1
man,	1
“and	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
given	1
thy	1
father	1
into	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
his	1
enemies?”	1
To	1
which	1
Zoraida	1
made	1
answer,	1
“A	1
Christian	1
I	1
am,	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
I	1
who	1
have	1
placed	1
thee	1
in	1
this	1
position,	1
for	1
it	1
never	1
was	1
my	1
wish	1
to	1
leave	1
thee	1
or	1
do	1
thee	1
harm,	1
but	1
only	1
to	1
do	1
good	1
to	1
myself.”	1
“And	1
what	1
good	1
hast	1
thou	1
done	1
thyself,	1
daughter?”	1
said	1
he.	1
“Ask	1
thou	1
that,”	1
said	1
she,	1
“of	1
Lela	1
Marien,	1
for	1
she	1
can	1
tell	1
thee	1
better	1
than	1
I.”	1
The	1
Moor	1
had	1
hardly	1
heard	1
these	1
words	1
when	1
with	1
marvellous	1
quickness	1
he	1
flung	1
himself	1
headforemost	1
into	1
the	1
sea,	1
where	1
no	1
doubt	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
drowned	1
had	1
not	1
the	1
long	1
and	1
full	1
dress	1
he	1
wore	1
held	1
him	1
up	1
for	1
a	1
little	1
on	1
the	1
surface	1
of	1
the	1
water.	1
Zoraida	1
cried	1
aloud	1
to	1
us	1
to	1
save	1
him,	1
and	1
we	1
all	1
hastened	1
to	1
help,	1
and	1
seizing	1
him	1
by	1
his	1
robe	1
we	1
drew	1
him	1
in	1
half	1
drowned	1
and	1
insensible,	1
at	1
which	1
Zoraida	1
was	1
in	1
such	1
distress	1
that	1
she	1
wept	1
over	1
him	1
as	1
piteously	1
and	1
bitterly	1
as	1
though	1
he	1
were	1
already	1
dead.	1
We	1
turned	1
him	1
upon	1
his	1
face	1
and	1
he	1
voided	1
a	1
great	1
quantity	1
of	1
water,	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
two	1
hours	1
came	1
to	1
himself.	1
Meanwhile,	1
the	1
wind	1
having	1
changed	1
we	1
were	1
compelled	1
to	1
head	1
for	1
the	1
land,	1
and	1
ply	1
our	1
oars	1
to	1
avoid	1
being	1
driven	1
on	1
shore;	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
our	1
good	1
fortune	1
to	1
reach	1
a	1
creek	1
that	1
lies	1
on	1
one	1
side	1
of	1
a	1
small	1
promontory	1
or	1
cape,	1
called	1
by	1
the	1
Moors	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
“Cava	1
rumia,”	1
which	1
in	1
our	1
language	1
means	1
“the	1
wicked	1
Christian	1
woman;”	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
tradition	1
among	1
them	1
that	1
La	1
Cava,	1
through	1
whom	1
Spain	1
was	1
lost,	1
lies	1
buried	1
at	1
that	1
spot;	1
“cava”	1
in	1
their	1
language	1
meaning	1
“wicked	1
woman,”	1
and	1
“rumia”	1
“Christian;”	1
moreover,	1
they	1
count	1
it	1
unlucky	1
to	1
anchor	1
there	1
when	1
necessity	1
compels	1
them,	1
and	1
they	1
never	1
do	1
so	1
otherwise.	1
For	1
us,	1
however,	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
the	1
resting-place	1
of	1
the	1
wicked	1
woman	1
but	1
a	1
haven	1
of	1
safety	1
for	1
our	1
relief,	1
so	1
much	1
had	1
the	1
sea	1
now	1
got	1
up.	1
We	1
posted	1
a	1
look-out	1
on	1
shore,	1
and	1
never	1
let	1
the	1
oars	1
out	1
of	1
our	1
hands,	1
and	1
ate	1
of	1
the	1
stores	1
the	1
renegade	1
had	1
laid	1
in,	1
imploring	1
God	1
and	1
Our	1
Lady	1
with	1
all	1
our	1
hearts	1
to	1
help	1
and	1
protect	1
us,	1
that	1
we	1
might	1
give	1
a	1
happy	1
ending	1
to	1
a	1
beginning	1
so	1
prosperous.	1
At	1
the	1
entreaty	1
of	1
Zoraida	1
orders	1
were	1
given	1
to	1
set	1
on	1
shore	1
her	1
father	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
Moors	1
who	1
were	1
still	1
bound,	1
for	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
endure,	1
nor	1
could	1
her	1
tender	1
heart	1
bear	1
to	1
see	1
her	1
father	1
in	1
bonds	1
and	1
her	1
fellow-countrymen	1
prisoners	1
before	1
her	1
eyes.	1
We	1
promised	1
her	1
to	1
do	1
this	1
at	1
the	1
moment	1
of	1
departure,	1
for	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
uninhabited	1
we	1
ran	1
no	1
risk	1
in	1
releasing	1
them	1
at	1
that	1
place.	1
Our	1
prayers	1
were	1
not	1
so	1
far	1
in	1
vain	1
as	1
to	1
be	1
unheard	1
by	1
Heaven,	1
for	1
after	1
a	1
while	1
the	1
wind	1
changed	1
in	1
our	1
favour,	1
and	1
made	1
the	1
sea	1
calm,	1
inviting	1
us	1
once	1
more	1
to	1
resume	1
our	1
voyage	1
with	1
a	1
good	1
heart.	1
Seeing	1
this	1
we	1
unbound	1
the	1
Moors,	1
and	1
one	1
by	1
one	1
put	1
them	1
on	1
shore,	1
at	1
which	1
they	1
were	1
filled	1
with	1
amazement;	1
but	1
when	1
we	1
came	1
to	1
land	1
Zoraida’s	1
father,	1
who	1
had	1
now	1
completely	1
recovered	1
his	1
senses,	1
he	1
said:	1
“Why	1
is	1
it,	1
think	1
ye,	1
Christians,	1
that	1
this	1
wicked	1
woman	1
is	1
rejoiced	1
at	1
your	1
giving	1
me	1
my	1
liberty?	1
Think	1
ye	1
it	1
is	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
affection	1
she	1
bears	1
me?	1
Nay	1
verily,	1
it	1
is	1
only	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
hindrance	1
my	1
presence	1
offers	1
to	1
the	1
execution	1
of	1
her	1
base	1
designs.	1
And	1
think	1
not	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
her	1
belief	1
that	1
yours	1
is	1
better	1
than	1
ours	1
that	1
has	1
led	1
her	1
to	1
change	1
her	1
religion;	1
it	1
is	1
only	1
because	1
she	1
knows	1
that	1
immodesty	1
is	1
more	1
freely	1
practised	1
in	1
your	1
country	1
than	1
in	1
ours.”	1
Then	1
turning	1
to	1
Zoraida,	1
while	1
I	1
and	1
another	1
of	1
the	1
Christians	1
held	1
him	1
fast	1
by	1
both	1
arms,	1
lest	1
he	1
should	1
do	1
some	1
mad	1
act,	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
her,	1
“Infamous	1
girl,	1
misguided	1
maiden,	1
whither	1
in	1
thy	1
blindness	1
and	1
madness	1
art	1
thou	1
going	1
in	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
these	1
dogs,	1
our	1
natural	1
enemies?	1
Cursed	1
be	1
the	1
hour	1
when	1
I	1
begot	1
thee!	1
Cursed	1
the	1
luxury	1
and	1
indulgence	1
in	1
which	1
I	1
reared	1
thee!”	1
But	1
seeing	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
likely	1
soon	1
to	1
cease	1
I	1
made	1
haste	1
to	1
put	1
him	1
on	1
shore,	1
and	1
thence	1
he	1
continued	1
his	1
maledictions	1
and	1
lamentations	1
aloud;	1
calling	1
on	1
Mohammed	1
to	1
pray	1
to	1
Allah	1
to	1
destroy	1
us,	1
to	1
confound	1
us,	1
to	1
make	1
an	1
end	1
of	1
us;	1
and	1
when,	1
in	1
consequence	1
of	1
having	1
made	1
sail,	1
we	1
could	1
no	1
longer	1
hear	1
what	1
he	1
said	1
we	1
could	1
see	1
what	1
he	1
did;	1
how	1
he	1
plucked	1
out	1
his	1
beard	1
and	1
tore	1
his	1
hair	1
and	1
lay	1
writhing	1
on	1
the	1
ground.	1
But	1
once	1
he	1
raised	1
his	1
voice	1
to	1
such	1
a	1
pitch	1
that	1
we	1
were	1
able	1
to	1
hear	1
what	1
he	1
said.	1
“Come	1
back,	1
dear	1
daughter,	1
come	1
back	1
to	1
shore;	1
I	1
forgive	1
thee	1
all;	1
let	1
those	1
men	1
have	1
the	1
money,	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
theirs	1
now,	1
and	1
come	1
back	1
to	1
comfort	1
thy	1
sorrowing	1
father,	1
who	1
will	1
yield	1
up	1
his	1
life	1
on	1
this	1
barren	1
strand	1
if	1
thou	1
dost	1
leave	1
him.”	1

All	1
this	1
Zoraida	1
heard,	1
and	1
heard	1
with	1
sorrow	1
and	1
tears,	1
and	1
all	1
she	1
could	1
say	1
in	1
answer	1
was,	1
“Allah	1
grant	1
that	1
Lela	1
Marien,	1
who	1
has	1
made	1
me	1
become	1
a	1
Christian,	1
give	1
thee	1
comfort	1
in	1
thy	1
sorrow,	1
my	1
father.	1
Allah	1
knows	1
that	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
do	1
otherwise	1
than	1
I	1
have	1
done,	1
and	1
that	1
these	1
Christians	1
owe	1
nothing	1
to	1
my	1
will;	1
for	1
even	1
had	1
I	1
wished	1
not	1
to	1
accompany	1
them,	1
but	1
remain	1
at	1
home,	1
it	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
impossible	1
for	1
me,	1
so	1
eagerly	1
did	1
my	1
soul	1
urge	1
me	1
on	1
to	1
the	1
accomplishment	1
of	1
this	1
purpose,	1
which	1
I	1
feel	1
to	1
be	1
as	1
righteous	1
as	1
to	1
thee,	1
dear	1
father,	1
it	1
seems	1
wicked.”	1
But	1
neither	1
could	1
her	1
father	1
hear	1
her	1
nor	1
we	1
see	1
him	1
when	1
she	1
said	1
this;	1
and	1
so,	1
while	1
I	1
consoled	1
Zoraida,	1
we	1
turned	1
our	1
attention	1
to	1
our	1
voyage,	1
in	1
which	1
a	1
breeze	1
from	1
the	1
right	1
point	1
so	1
favoured	1
us	1
that	1
we	1
made	1
sure	1
of	1
finding	1
ourselves	1
off	1
the	1
coast	1
of	1
Spain	1
on	1
the	1
morrow	1
by	1
daybreak.	1
But,	1
as	1
good	1
seldom	1
or	1
never	1
comes	1
pure	1
and	1
unmixed,	1
without	1
being	1
attended	1
or	1
followed	1
by	1
some	1
disturbing	1
evil	1
that	1
gives	1
a	1
shock	1
to	1
it,	1
our	1
fortune,	1
or	1
perhaps	1
the	1
curses	1
which	1
the	1
Moor	1
had	1
hurled	1
at	1
his	1
daughter	1
(for	1
whatever	1
kind	1
of	1
father	1
they	1
may	1
come	1
from	1
these	1
are	1
always	1
to	1
be	1
dreaded),	1
brought	1
it	1
about	1
that	1
when	1
we	1
were	1
now	1
in	1
mid-sea,	1
and	1
the	1
night	1
about	1
three	1
hours	1
spent,	1
as	1
we	1
were	1
running	1
with	1
all	1
sail	1
set	1
and	1
oars	1
lashed,	1
for	1
the	1
favouring	1
breeze	1
saved	1
us	1
the	1
trouble	1
of	1
using	1
them,	1
we	1
saw	1
by	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
the	1
moon,	1
which	1
shone	1
brilliantly,	1
a	1
square-rigged	1
vessel	1
in	1
full	1
sail	1
close	1
to	1
us,	1
luffing	1
up	1
and	1
standing	1
across	1
our	1
course,	1
and	1
so	1
close	1
that	1
we	1
had	1
to	1
strike	1
sail	1
to	1
avoid	1
running	1
foul	1
of	1
her,	1
while	1
they	1
too	1
put	1
the	1
helm	1
hard	1
up	1
to	1
let	1
us	1
pass.	1
They	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
ship	1
to	1
ask	1
who	1
we	1
were,	1
whither	1
we	1
were	1
bound,	1
and	1
whence	1
we	1
came,	1
but	1
as	1
they	1
asked	1
this	1
in	1
French	1
our	1
renegade	1
said,	1
“Let	1
no	1
one	1
answer,	1
for	1
no	1
doubt	1
these	1
are	1
French	1
corsairs	1
who	1
plunder	1
all	1
comers.”	1

Acting	1
on	1
this	1
warning	1
no	1
one	1
answered	1
a	1
word,	1
but	1
after	1
we	1
had	1
gone	1
a	1
little	1
ahead,	1
and	1
the	1
vessel	1
was	1
now	1
lying	1
to	1
leeward,	1
suddenly	1
they	1
fired	1
two	1
guns,	1
and	1
apparently	1
both	1
loaded	1
with	1
chain-shot,	1
for	1
with	1
one	1
they	1
cut	1
our	1
mast	1
in	1
half	1
and	1
brought	1
down	1
both	1
it	1
and	1
the	1
sail	1
into	1
the	1
sea,	1
and	1
the	1
other,	1
discharged	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
moment,	1
sent	1
a	1
ball	1
into	1
our	1
vessel	1
amidships,	1
staving	1
her	1
in	1
completely,	1
but	1
without	1
doing	1
any	1
further	1
damage.	1
We,	1
however,	1
finding	1
ourselves	1
sinking	1
began	1
to	1
shout	1
for	1
help	1
and	1
call	1
upon	1
those	1
in	1
the	1
ship	1
to	1
pick	1
us	1
up	1
as	1
we	1
were	1
beginning	1
to	1
fill.	1
They	1
then	1
lay	1
to,	1
and	1
lowering	1
a	1
skiff	1
or	1
boat,	1
as	1
many	1
as	1
a	1
dozen	1
Frenchmen,	1
well	1
armed	1
with	1
match-locks,	1
and	1
their	1
matches	1
burning,	1
got	1
into	1
it	1
and	1
came	1
alongside;	1
and	1
seeing	1
how	1
few	1
we	1
were,	1
and	1
that	1
our	1
vessel	1
was	1
going	1
down,	1
they	1
took	1
us	1
in,	1
telling	1
us	1
that	1
this	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
us	1
through	1
our	1
incivility	1
in	1
not	1
giving	1
them	1
an	1
answer.	1
Our	1
renegade	1
took	1
the	1
trunk	1
containing	1
Zoraida’s	1
wealth	1
and	1
dropped	1
it	1
into	1
the	1
sea	1
without	1
anyone	1
perceiving	1
what	1
he	1
did.	1
In	1
short	1
we	1
went	1
on	1
board	1
with	1
the	1
Frenchmen,	1
who,	1
after	1
having	1
ascertained	1
all	1
they	1
wanted	1
to	1
know	1
about	1
us,	1
rifled	1
us	1
of	1
everything	1
we	1
had,	1
as	1
if	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
our	1
bitterest	1
enemies,	1
and	1
from	1
Zoraida	1
they	1
took	1
even	1
the	1
anklets	1
she	1
wore	1
on	1
her	1
feet;	1
but	1
the	1
distress	1
they	1
caused	1
her	1
did	1
not	1
distress	1
me	1
so	1
much	1
as	1
the	1
fear	1
I	1
was	1
in	1
that	1
from	1
robbing	1
her	1
of	1
her	1
rich	1
and	1
precious	1
jewels	1
they	1
would	1
proceed	1
to	1
rob	1
her	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
precious	1
jewel	1
that	1
she	1
valued	1
more	1
than	1
all.	1
The	1
desires,	1
however,	1
of	1
those	1
people	1
do	1
not	1
go	1
beyond	1
money,	1
but	1
of	1
that	1
their	1
covetousness	1
is	1
insatiable,	1
and	1
on	1
this	1
occasion	1
it	1
was	1
carried	1
to	1
such	1
a	1
pitch	1
that	1
they	1
would	1
have	1
taken	1
even	1
the	1
clothes	1
we	1
wore	1
as	1
captives	1
if	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
worth	1
anything	1
to	1
them.	1
It	1
was	1
the	1
advice	1
of	1
some	1
of	1
them	1
to	1
throw	1
us	1
all	1
into	1
the	1
sea	1
wrapped	1
up	1
in	1
a	1
sail;	1
for	1
their	1
purpose	1
was	1
to	1
trade	1
at	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
ports	1
of	1
Spain,	1
giving	1
themselves	1
out	1
as	1
Bretons,	1
and	1
if	1
they	1
brought	1
us	1
alive	1
they	1
would	1
be	1
punished	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
the	1
robbery	1
was	1
discovered;	1
but	1
the	1
captain	1
(who	1
was	1
the	1
one	1
who	1
had	1
plundered	1
my	1
beloved	1
Zoraida)	1
said	1
he	1
was	1
satisfied	1
with	1
the	1
prize	1
he	1
had	1
got,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
touch	1
at	1
any	1
Spanish	1
port,	1
but	1
pass	1
the	1
Straits	1
of	1
Gibraltar	1
by	1
night,	1
or	1
as	1
best	1
he	1
could,	1
and	1
make	1
for	1
La	1
Rochelle,	1
from	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
sailed.	1
So	1
they	1
agreed	1
by	1
common	1
consent	1
to	1
give	1
us	1
the	1
skiff	1
belonging	1
to	1
their	1
ship	1
and	1
all	1
we	1
required	1
for	1
the	1
short	1
voyage	1
that	1
remained	1
to	1
us,	1
and	1
this	1
they	1
did	1
the	1
next	1
day	1
on	1
coming	1
in	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
Spanish	1
coast,	1
with	1
which,	1
and	1
the	1
joy	1
we	1
felt,	1
all	1
our	1
sufferings	1
and	1
miseries	1
were	1
as	1
completely	1
forgotten	1
as	1
if	1
they	1
had	1
never	1
been	1
endured	1
by	1
us,	1
such	1
is	1
the	1
delight	1
of	1
recovering	1
lost	1
liberty.	1
It	1
may	1
have	1
been	1
about	1
mid-day	1
when	1
they	1
placed	1
us	1
in	1
the	1
boat,	1
giving	1
us	1
two	1
kegs	1
of	1
water	1
and	1
some	1
biscuit;	1
and	1
the	1
captain,	1
moved	1
by	1
I	1
know	1
not	1
what	1
compassion,	1
as	1
the	1
lovely	1
Zoraida	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
embark,	1
gave	1
her	1
some	1
forty	1
gold	1
crowns,	1
and	1
would	1
not	1
permit	1
his	1
men	1
to	1
take	1
from	1
her	1
those	1
same	1
garments	1
which	1
she	1
has	1
on	1
now.	1
We	1
got	1
into	1
the	1
boat,	1
returning	1
them	1
thanks	1
for	1
their	1
kindness	1
to	1
us,	1
and	1
showing	1
ourselves	1
grateful	1
rather	1
than	1
indignant.	1
They	1
stood	1
out	1
to	1
sea,	1
steering	1
for	1
the	1
straits;	1
we,	1
without	1
looking	1
to	1
any	1
compass	1
save	1
the	1
land	1
we	1
had	1
before	1
us,	1
set	1
ourselves	1
to	1
row	1
with	1
such	1
energy	1
that	1
by	1
sunset	1
we	1
were	1
so	1
near	1
that	1
we	1
might	1
easily,	1
we	1
thought,	1
land	1
before	1
the	1
night	1
was	1
far	1
advanced.	1
But	1
as	1
the	1
moon	1
did	1
not	1
show	1
that	1
night,	1
and	1
the	1
sky	1
was	1
clouded,	1
and	1
as	1
we	1
knew	1
not	1
whereabouts	1
we	1
were,	1
it	1
did	1
not	1
seem	1
to	1
us	1
a	1
prudent	1
thing	1
to	1
make	1
for	1
the	1
shore,	1
as	1
several	1
of	1
us	1
advised,	1
saying	1
we	1
ought	1
to	1
run	1
ourselves	1
ashore	1
even	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
on	1
rocks	1
and	1
far	1
from	1
any	1
habitation,	1
for	1
in	1
this	1
way	1
we	1
should	1
be	1
relieved	1
from	1
the	1
apprehensions	1
we	1
naturally	1
felt	1
of	1
the	1
prowling	1
vessels	1
of	1
the	1
Tetuan	1
corsairs,	1
who	1
leave	1
Barbary	1
at	1
nightfall	1
and	1
are	1
on	1
the	1
Spanish	1
coast	1
by	1
daybreak,	1
where	1
they	1
commonly	1
take	1
some	1
prize,	1
and	1
then	1
go	1
home	1
to	1
sleep	1
in	1
their	1
own	1
houses.	1
But	1
of	1
the	1
conflicting	1
counsels	1
the	1
one	1
which	1
was	1
adopted	1
was	1
that	1
we	1
should	1
approach	1
gradually,	1
and	1
land	1
where	1
we	1
could	1
if	1
the	1
sea	1
were	1
calm	1
enough	1
to	1
permit	1
us.	1
This	1
was	1
done,	1
and	1
a	1
little	1
before	1
midnight	1
we	1
drew	1
near	1
to	1
the	1
foot	1
of	1
a	1
huge	1
and	1
lofty	1
mountain,	1
not	1
so	1
close	1
to	1
the	1
sea	1
but	1
that	1
it	1
left	1
a	1
narrow	1
space	1
on	1
which	1
to	1
land	1
conveniently.	1
We	1
ran	1
our	1
boat	1
up	1
on	1
the	1
sand,	1
and	1
all	1
sprang	1
out	1
and	1
kissed	1
the	1
ground,	1
and	1
with	1
tears	1
of	1
joyful	1
satisfaction	1
returned	1
thanks	1
to	1
God	1
our	1
Lord	1
for	1
all	1
his	1
incomparable	1
goodness	1
to	1
us	1
on	1
our	1
voyage.	1
We	1
took	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
boat	1
the	1
provisions	1
it	1
contained,	1
and	1
drew	1
it	1
up	1
on	1
the	1
shore,	1
and	1
then	1
climbed	1
a	1
long	1
way	1
up	1
the	1
mountain,	1
for	1
even	1
there	1
we	1
could	1
not	1
feel	1
easy	1
in	1
our	1
hearts,	1
or	1
persuade	1
ourselves	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
Christian	1
soil	1
that	1
was	1
now	1
under	1
our	1
feet.	1
The	1
dawn	1
came,	1
more	1
slowly,	1
I	1
think,	1
than	1
we	1
could	1
have	1
wished;	1
we	1
completed	1
the	1
ascent	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
see	1
if	1
from	1
the	1
summit	1
any	1
habitation	1
or	1
any	1
shepherds’	1
huts	1
could	1
be	1
discovered,	1
but	1
strain	1
our	1
eyes	1
as	1
we	1
might,	1
neither	1
dwelling,	1
nor	1
human	1
being,	1
nor	1
path	1
nor	1
road	1
could	1
we	1
perceive.	1
However,	1
we	1
determined	1
to	1
push	1
on	1
farther,	1
as	1
it	1
could	1
not	1
but	1
be	1
that	1
ere	1
long	1
we	1
must	1
see	1
someone	1
who	1
could	1
tell	1
us	1
where	1
we	1
were.	1
But	1
what	1
distressed	1
me	1
most	1
was	1
to	1
see	1
Zoraida	1
going	1
on	1
foot	1
over	1
that	1
rough	1
ground;	1
for	1
though	1
I	1
once	1
carried	1
her	1
on	1
my	1
shoulders,	1
she	1
was	1
more	1
wearied	1
by	1
my	1
weariness	1
than	1
rested	1
by	1
the	1
rest;	1
and	1
so	1
she	1
would	1
never	1
again	1
allow	1
me	1
to	1
undergo	1
the	1
exertion,	1
and	1
went	1
on	1
very	1
patiently	1
and	1
cheerfully,	1
while	1
I	1
led	1
her	1
by	1
the	1
hand.	1
We	1
had	1
gone	1
rather	1
less	1
than	1
a	1
quarter	1
of	1
a	1
league	1
when	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
a	1
little	1
bell	1
fell	1
on	1
our	1
ears,	1
a	1
clear	1
proof	1
that	1
there	1
were	1
flocks	1
hard	1
by,	1
and	1
looking	1
about	1
carefully	1
to	1
see	1
if	1
any	1
were	1
within	1
view,	1
we	1
observed	1
a	1
young	1
shepherd	1
tranquilly	1
and	1
unsuspiciously	1
trimming	1
a	1
stick	1
with	1
his	1
knife	1
at	1
the	1
foot	1
of	1
a	1
cork	1
tree.	1
We	1
called	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
he,	1
raising	1
his	1
head,	1
sprang	1
nimbly	1
to	1
his	1
feet,	1
for,	1
as	1
we	1
afterwards	1
learned,	1
the	1
first	1
who	1
presented	1
themselves	1
to	1
his	1
sight	1
were	1
the	1
renegade	1
and	1
Zoraida,	1
and	1
seeing	1
them	1
in	1
Moorish	1
dress	1
he	1
imagined	1
that	1
all	1
the	1
Moors	1
of	1
Barbary	1
were	1
upon	1
him;	1
and	1
plunging	1
with	1
marvellous	1
swiftness	1
into	1
the	1
thicket	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
him,	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
raise	1
a	1
prodigious	1
outcry,	1
exclaiming,	1
“The	1
Moors—the	1
Moors	1
have	1
landed!	1
To	1
arms,	1
to	1
arms!”	1
We	1
were	1
all	1
thrown	1
into	1
perplexity	1
by	1
these	1
cries,	1
not	1
knowing	1
what	1
to	1
do;	1
but	1
reflecting	1
that	1
the	1
shouts	1
of	1
the	1
shepherd	1
would	1
raise	1
the	1
country	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
mounted	1
coast-guard	1
would	1
come	1
at	1
once	1
to	1
see	1
what	1
was	1
the	1
matter,	1
we	1
agreed	1
that	1
the	1
renegade	1
must	1
strip	1
off	1
his	1
Turkish	1
garments	1
and	1
put	1
on	1
a	1
captive’s	1
jacket	1
or	1
coat	1
which	1
one	1
of	1
our	1
party	1
gave	1
him	1
at	1
once,	1
though	1
he	1
himself	1
was	1
reduced	1
to	1
his	1
shirt;	1
and	1
so	1
commending	1
ourselves	1
to	1
God,	1
we	1
followed	1
the	1
same	1
road	1
which	1
we	1
saw	1
the	1
shepherd	1
take,	1
expecting	1
every	1
moment	1
that	1
the	1
coast-guard	1
would	1
be	1
down	1
upon	1
us.	1
Nor	1
did	1
our	1
expectation	1
deceive	1
us,	1
for	1
two	1
hours	1
had	1
not	1
passed	1
when,	1
coming	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
brushwood	1
into	1
the	1
open	1
ground,	1
we	1
perceived	1
some	1
fifty	1
mounted	1
men	1
swiftly	1
approaching	1
us	1
at	1
a	1
hand-gallop.	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
we	1
saw	1
them	1
we	1
stood	1
still,	1
waiting	1
for	1
them;	1
but	1
as	1
they	1
came	1
close	1
and,	1
instead	1
of	1
the	1
Moors	1
they	1
were	1
in	1
quest	1
of,	1
saw	1
a	1
set	1
of	1
poor	1
Christians,	1
they	1
were	1
taken	1
aback,	1
and	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
asked	1
if	1
it	1
could	1
be	1
we	1
who	1
were	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
the	1
shepherd	1
having	1
raised	1
the	1
call	1
to	1
arms.	1
I	1
said	1
“Yes,”	1
and	1
as	1
I	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
explain	1
to	1
him	1
what	1
had	1
occurred,	1
and	1
whence	1
we	1
came	1
and	1
who	1
we	1
were,	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
Christians	1
of	1
our	1
party	1
recognised	1
the	1
horseman	1
who	1
had	1
put	1
the	1
question	1
to	1
us,	1
and	1
before	1
I	1
could	1
say	1
anything	1
more	1
he	1
exclaimed:	1
“Thanks	1
be	1
to	1
God,	1
sirs,	1
for	1
bringing	1
us	1
to	1
such	1
good	1
quarters;	1
for,	1
if	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
deceive	1
myself,	1
the	1
ground	1
we	1
stand	1
on	1
is	1
that	1
of	1
Velez	1
Malaga	1
unless,	1
indeed,	1
all	1
my	1
years	1
of	1
captivity	1
have	1
made	1
me	1
unable	1
to	1
recollect	1
that	1
you,	1
señor,	1
who	1
ask	1
who	1
we	1
are,	1
are	1
Pedro	1
de	1
Bustamante,	1
my	1
uncle.”	1
The	1
Christian	1
captive	1
had	1
hardly	1
uttered	1
these	1
words,	1
when	1
the	1
horseman	1
threw	1
himself	1
off	1
his	1
horse,	1
and	1
ran	1
to	1
embrace	1
the	1
young	1
man,	1
crying:	1
“Nephew	1
of	1
my	1
soul	1
and	1
life!	1
I	1
recognise	1
thee	1
now;	1
and	1
long	1
have	1
I	1
mourned	1
thee	1
as	1
dead,	1
I,	1
and	1
my	1
sister,	1
thy	1
mother,	1
and	1
all	1
thy	1
kin	1
that	1
are	1
still	1
alive,	1
and	1
whom	1
God	1
has	1
been	1
pleased	1
to	1
preserve	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
enjoy	1
the	1
happiness	1
of	1
seeing	1
thee.	1
We	1
knew	1
long	1
since	1
that	1
thou	1
wert	1
in	1
Algiers,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
appearance	1
of	1
thy	1
garments	1
and	1
those	1
of	1
all	1
this	1
company,	1
I	1
conclude	1
that	1
ye	1
have	1
had	1
a	1
miraculous	1
restoration	1
to	1
liberty.”	1
“It	1
is	1
true,”	1
replied	1
the	1
young	1
man,	1
“and	1
by-and-by	1
we	1
will	1
tell	1
you	1
all.”	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
the	1
horsemen	1
understood	1
that	1
we	1
were	1
Christian	1
captives,	1
they	1
dismounted	1
from	1
their	1
horses,	1
and	1
each	1
offered	1
his	1
to	1
carry	1
us	1
to	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
Velez	1
Malaga,	1
which	1
was	1
a	1
league	1
and	1
a	1
half	1
distant.	1
Some	1
of	1
them	1
went	1
to	1
bring	1
the	1
boat	1
to	1
the	1
city,	1
we	1
having	1
told	1
them	1
where	1
we	1
had	1
left	1
it;	1
others	1
took	1
us	1
up	1
behind	1
them,	1
and	1
Zoraida	1
was	1
placed	1
on	1
the	1
horse	1
of	1
the	1
young	1
man’s	1
uncle.	1
The	1
whole	1
town	1
came	1
out	1
to	1
meet	1
us,	1
for	1
they	1
had	1
by	1
this	1
time	1
heard	1
of	1
our	1
arrival	1
from	1
one	1
who	1
had	1
gone	1
on	1
in	1
advance.	1
They	1
were	1
not	1
astonished	1
to	1
see	1
liberated	1
captives	1
or	1
captive	1
Moors,	1
for	1
people	1
on	1
that	1
coast	1
are	1
well	1
used	1
to	1
see	1
both	1
one	1
and	1
the	1
other;	1
but	1
they	1
were	1
astonished	1
at	1
the	1
beauty	1
of	1
Zoraida,	1
which	1
was	1
just	1
then	1
heightened,	1
as	1
well	1
by	1
the	1
exertion	1
of	1
travelling	1
as	1
by	1
joy	1
at	1
finding	1
herself	1
on	1
Christian	1
soil,	1
and	1
relieved	1
of	1
all	1
fear	1
of	1
being	1
lost;	1
for	1
this	1
had	1
brought	1
such	1
a	1
glow	1
upon	1
her	1
face,	1
that	1
unless	1
my	1
affection	1
for	1
her	1
were	1
deceiving	1
me,	1
I	1
would	1
venture	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
more	1
beautiful	1
creature	1
in	1
the	1
world—at	1
least,	1
that	1
I	1
had	1
ever	1
seen.	1
We	1
went	1
straight	1
to	1
the	1
church	1
to	1
return	1
thanks	1
to	1
God	1
for	1
the	1
mercies	1
we	1
had	1
received,	1
and	1
when	1
Zoraida	1
entered	1
it	1
she	1
said	1
there	1
were	1
faces	1
there	1
like	1
Lela	1
Marien’s.	1
We	1
told	1
her	1
they	1
were	1
her	1
images;	1
and	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
he	1
could	1
the	1
renegade	1
explained	1
to	1
her	1
what	1
they	1
meant,	1
that	1
she	1
might	1
adore	1
them	1
as	1
if	1
each	1
of	1
them	1
were	1
the	1
very	1
same	1
Lela	1
Marien	1
that	1
had	1
spoken	1
to	1
her;	1
and	1
she,	1
having	1
great	1
intelligence	1
and	1
a	1
quick	1
and	1
clear	1
instinct,	1
understood	1
at	1
once	1
all	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
her	1
about	1
them.	1
Thence	1
they	1
took	1
us	1
away	1
and	1
distributed	1
us	1
all	1
in	1
different	1
houses	1
in	1
the	1
town;	1
but	1
as	1
for	1
the	1
renegade,	1
Zoraida,	1
and	1
myself,	1
the	1
Christian	1
who	1
came	1
with	1
us	1
brought	1
us	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
his	1
parents,	1
who	1
had	1
a	1
fair	1
share	1
of	1
the	1
gifts	1
of	1
fortune,	1
and	1
treated	1
us	1
with	1
as	1
much	1
kindness	1
as	1
they	1
did	1
their	1
own	1
son.	1
We	1
remained	1
six	1
days	1
in	1
Velez,	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
which	1
the	1
renegade,	1
having	1
informed	1
himself	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
was	1
requisite	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
do,	1
set	1
out	1
for	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
Granada	1
to	1
restore	1
himself	1
to	1
the	1
sacred	1
bosom	1
of	1
the	1
Church	1
through	1
the	1
medium	1
of	1
the	1
Holy	1
Inquisition.	1
The	1
other	1
released	1
captives	1
took	1
their	1
departures,	1
each	1
the	1
way	1
that	1
seemed	1
best	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
Zoraida	1
and	1
I	1
were	1
left	1
alone,	1
with	1
nothing	1
more	1
than	1
the	1
crowns	1
which	1
the	1
courtesy	1
of	1
the	1
Frenchman	1
had	1
bestowed	1
upon	1
Zoraida,	1
out	1
of	1
which	1
I	1
bought	1
the	1
beast	1
on	1
which	1
she	1
rides;	1
and,	1
I	1
for	1
the	1
present	1
attending	1
her	1
as	1
her	1
father	1
and	1
squire	1
and	1
not	1
as	1
her	1
husband,	1
we	1
are	1
now	1
going	1
to	1
ascertain	1
if	1
my	1
father	1
is	1
living,	1
or	1
if	1
any	1
of	1
my	1
brothers	1
has	1
had	1
better	1
fortune	1
than	1
mine	1
has	1
been;	1
though,	1
as	1
Heaven	1
has	1
made	1
me	1
the	1
companion	1
of	1
Zoraida,	1
I	1
think	1
no	1
other	1
lot	1
could	1
be	1
assigned	1
to	1
me,	1
however	1
happy,	1
that	1
I	1
would	1
rather	1
have.	1
The	1
patience	1
with	1
which	1
she	1
endures	1
the	1
hardships	1
that	1
poverty	1
brings	1
with	1
it,	1
and	1
the	1
eagerness	1
she	1
shows	1
to	1
become	1
a	1
Christian,	1
are	1
such	1
that	1
they	1
fill	1
me	1
with	1
admiration,	1
and	1
bind	1
me	1
to	1
serve	1
her	1
all	1
my	1
life;	1
though	1
the	1
happiness	1
I	1
feel	1
in	1
seeing	1
myself	1
hers,	1
and	1
her	1
mine,	1
is	1
disturbed	1
and	1
marred	1
by	1
not	1
knowing	1
whether	1
I	1
shall	1
find	1
any	1
corner	1
to	1
shelter	1
her	1
in	1
my	1
own	1
country,	1
or	1
whether	1
time	1
and	1
death	1
may	1
not	1
have	1
made	1
such	1
changes	1
in	1
the	1
fortunes	1
and	1
lives	1
of	1
my	1
father	1
and	1
brothers,	1
that	1
I	1
shall	1
hardly	1
find	1
anyone	1
who	1
knows	1
me,	1
if	1
they	1
are	1
not	1
alive.	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
more	1
of	1
my	1
story	1
to	1
tell	1
you,	1
gentlemen;	1
whether	1
it	1
be	1
an	1
interesting	1
or	1
a	1
curious	1
one	1
let	1
your	1
better	1
judgments	1
decide;	1
all	1
I	1
can	1
say	1
is	1
I	1
would	1
gladly	1
have	1
told	1
it	1
to	1
you	1
more	1
briefly;	1
although	1
my	1
fear	1
of	1
wearying	1
you	1
has	1
made	1
me	1
leave	1
out	1
more	1
than	1
one	1
circumstance.	1

With	1
these	1
words	1
the	1
captive	1
held	1
his	1
peace,	1
and	1
Don	1
Fernando	1
said	1
to	1
him,	1
“In	1
truth,	1
captain,	1
the	1
manner	1
in	1
which	1
you	1
have	1
related	1
this	1
remarkable	1
adventure	1
has	1
been	1
such	1
as	1
befitted	1
the	1
novelty	1
and	1
strangeness	1
of	1
the	1
matter.	1
The	1
whole	1
story	1
is	1
curious	1
and	1
uncommon,	1
and	1
abounds	1
with	1
incidents	1
that	1
fill	1
the	1
hearers	1
with	1
wonder	1
and	1
astonishment;	1
and	1
so	1
great	1
is	1
the	1
pleasure	1
we	1
have	1
found	1
in	1
listening	1
to	1
it	1
that	1
we	1
should	1
be	1
glad	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
to	1
begin	1
again,	1
even	1
though	1
to-morrow	1
were	1
to	1
find	1
us	1
still	1
occupied	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
tale.”	1
And	1
while	1
he	1
said	1
this	1
Cardenio	1
and	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
them	1
offered	1
to	1
be	1
of	1
service	1
to	1
him	1
in	1
any	1
way	1
that	1
lay	1
in	1
their	1
power,	1
and	1
in	1
words	1
and	1
language	1
so	1
kindly	1
and	1
sincere	1
that	1
the	1
captain	1
was	1
much	1
gratified	1
by	1
their	1
good-will.	1
In	1
particular	1
Don	1
Fernando	1
offered,	1
if	1
he	1
would	1
go	1
back	1
with	1
him,	1
to	1
get	1
his	1
brother	1
the	1
marquis	1
to	1
become	1
godfather	1
at	1
the	1
baptism	1
of	1
Zoraida,	1
and	1
on	1
his	1
own	1
part	1
to	1
provide	1
him	1
with	1
the	1
means	1
of	1
making	1
his	1
appearance	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
country	1
with	1
the	1
credit	1
and	1
comfort	1
he	1
was	1
entitled	1
to.	1
For	1
all	1
this	1
the	1
captive	1
returned	1
thanks	1
very	1
courteously,	1
although	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
accept	1
any	1
of	1
their	1
generous	1
offers.	1
By	1
this	1
time	1
night	1
closed	1
in,	1
and	1
as	1
it	1
did,	1
there	1
came	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
inn	1
a	1
coach	1
attended	1
by	1
some	1
men	1
on	1
horseback,	1
who	1
demanded	1
accommodation;	1
to	1
which	1
the	1
landlady	1
replied	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
hand’s	1
breadth	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
inn	1
unoccupied.	1
“Still,	1
for	1
all	1
that,”	1
said	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
had	1
entered	1
on	1
horseback,	1
“room	1
must	1
be	1
found	1
for	1
his	1
lordship	1
the	1
Judge	1
here.”	1
At	1
this	1
name	1
the	1
landlady	1
was	1
taken	1
aback,	1
and	1
said,	1
“Señor,	1
the	1
fact	1
is	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
beds;	1
but	1
if	1
his	1
lordship	1
the	1
Judge	1
carries	1
one	1
with	1
him,	1
as	1
no	1
doubt	1
he	1
does,	1
let	1
him	1
come	1
in	1
and	1
welcome;	1
for	1
my	1
husband	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
up	1
our	1
room	1
to	1
accommodate	1
his	1
worship.”	1
“Very	1
good,	1
so	1
be	1
it,”	1
said	1
the	1
squire;	1
but	1
in	1
the	1
meantime	1
a	1
man	1
had	1
got	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
coach	1
whose	1
dress	1
indicated	1
at	1
a	1
glance	1
the	1
office	1
and	1
post	1
he	1
held,	1
for	1
the	1
long	1
robe	1
with	1
ruffled	1
sleeves	1
that	1
he	1
wore	1
showed	1
that	1
he	1
was,	1
as	1
his	1
servant	1
said,	1
a	1
Judge	1
of	1
appeal.	1
He	1
led	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
a	1
young	1
girl	1
in	1
a	1
travelling	1
dress,	1
apparently	1
about	1
sixteen	1
years	1
of	1
age,	1
and	1
of	1
such	1
a	1
high-bred	1
air,	1
so	1
beautiful	1
and	1
so	1
graceful,	1
that	1
all	1
were	1
filled	1
with	1
admiration	1
when	1
she	1
made	1
her	1
appearance,	1
and	1
but	1
for	1
having	1
seen	1
Dorothea,	1
Luscinda,	1
and	1
Zoraida,	1
who	1
were	1
there	1
in	1
the	1
inn,	1
they	1
would	1
have	1
fancied	1
that	1
a	1
beauty	1
like	1
that	1
of	1
this	1
maiden’s	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
hard	1
to	1
find.	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
was	1
present	1
at	1
the	1
entrance	1
of	1
the	1
Judge	1
with	1
the	1
young	1
lady,	1
and	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
saw	1
him	1
he	1
said,	1
“Your	1
worship	1
may	1
with	1
confidence	1
enter	1
and	1
take	1
your	1
ease	1
in	1
this	1
castle;	1
for	1
though	1
the	1
accommodation	1
be	1
scanty	1
and	1
poor,	1
there	1
are	1
no	1
quarters	1
so	1
cramped	1
or	1
inconvenient	1
that	1
they	1
cannot	1
make	1
room	1
for	1
arms	1
and	1
letters;	1
above	1
all	1
if	1
arms	1
and	1
letters	1
have	1
beauty	1
for	1
a	1
guide	1
and	1
leader,	1
as	1
letters	1
represented	1
by	1
your	1
worship	1
have	1
in	1
this	1
fair	1
maiden,	1
to	1
whom	1
not	1
only	1
ought	1
castles	1
to	1
throw	1
themselves	1
open	1
and	1
yield	1
themselves	1
up,	1
but	1
rocks	1
should	1
rend	1
themselves	1
asunder	1
and	1
mountains	1
divide	1
and	1
bow	1
themselves	1
down	1
to	1
give	1
her	1
a	1
reception.	1
Enter,	1
your	1
worship,	1
I	1
say,	1
into	1
this	1
paradise,	1
for	1
here	1
you	1
will	1
find	1
stars	1
and	1
suns	1
to	1
accompany	1
the	1
heaven	1
your	1
worship	1
brings	1
with	1
you,	1
here	1
you	1
will	1
find	1
arms	1
in	1
their	1
supreme	1
excellence,	1
and	1
beauty	1
in	1
its	1
highest	1
perfection.”	1
The	1
Judge	1
was	1
struck	1
with	1
amazement	1
at	1
the	1
language	1
of	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
whom	1
he	1
scrutinized	1
very	1
carefully,	1
no	1
less	1
astonished	1
by	1
his	1
figure	1
than	1
by	1
his	1
talk;	1
and	1
before	1
he	1
could	1
find	1
words	1
to	1
answer	1
him	1
he	1
had	1
a	1
fresh	1
surprise,	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
opposite	1
to	1
him	1
Luscinda,	1
Dorothea,	1
and	1
Zoraida,	1
who,	1
having	1
heard	1
of	1
the	1
new	1
guests	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
beauty	1
of	1
the	1
young	1
lady,	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
see	1
her	1
and	1
welcome	1
her;	1
Don	1
Fernando,	1
Cardenio,	1
and	1
the	1
curate,	1
however,	1
greeted	1
him	1
in	1
a	1
more	1
intelligible	1
and	1
polished	1
style.	1
In	1
short,	1
the	1
Judge	1
made	1
his	1
entrance	1
in	1
a	1
state	1
of	1
bewilderment,	1
as	1
well	1
with	1
what	1
he	1
saw	1
as	1
what	1
he	1
heard,	1
and	1
the	1
fair	1
ladies	1
of	1
the	1
inn	1
gave	1
the	1
fair	1
damsel	1
a	1
cordial	1
welcome.	1
On	1
the	1
whole	1
he	1
could	1
perceive	1
that	1
all	1
who	1
were	1
there	1
were	1
people	1
of	1
quality;	1
but	1
with	1
the	1
figure,	1
countenance,	1
and	1
bearing	1
of	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
he	1
was	1
at	1
his	1
wits’	1
end;	1
and	1
all	1
civilities	1
having	1
been	1
exchanged,	1
and	1
the	1
accommodation	1
of	1
the	1
inn	1
inquired	1
into,	1
it	1
was	1
settled,	1
as	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
before	1
settled,	1
that	1
all	1
the	1
women	1
should	1
retire	1
to	1
the	1
garret	1
that	1
has	1
been	1
already	1
mentioned,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
men	1
should	1
remain	1
outside	1
as	1
if	1
to	1
guard	1
them;	1
the	1
Judge,	1
therefore,	1
was	1
very	1
well	1
pleased	1
to	1
allow	1
his	1
daughter,	1
for	1
such	1
the	1
damsel	1
was,	1
to	1
go	1
with	1
the	1
ladies,	1
which	1
she	1
did	1
very	1
willingly;	1
and	1
with	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
host’s	1
narrow	1
bed	1
and	1
half	1
of	1
what	1
the	1
Judge	1
had	1
brought	1
with	1
him,	1
they	1
made	1
a	1
more	1
comfortable	1
arrangement	1
for	1
the	1
night	1
than	1
they	1
had	1
expected.	1
The	1
captive,	1
whose	1
heart	1
had	1
leaped	1
within	1
him	1
the	1
instant	1
he	1
saw	1
the	1
Judge,	1
telling	1
him	1
somehow	1
that	1
this	1
was	1
his	1
brother,	1
asked	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
servants	1
who	1
accompanied	1
him	1
what	1
his	1
name	1
was,	1
and	1
whether	1
he	1
knew	1
from	1
what	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
country	1
he	1
came.	1
The	1
servant	1
replied	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
called	1
the	1
Licentiate	1
Juan	1
Perez	1
de	1
Viedma,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
heard	1
it	1
said	1
he	1
came	1
from	1
a	1
village	1
in	1
the	1
mountains	1
of	1
Leon.	1
From	1
this	1
statement,	1
and	1
what	1
he	1
himself	1
had	1
seen,	1
he	1
felt	1
convinced	1
that	1
this	1
was	1
his	1
brother	1
who	1
had	1
adopted	1
letters	1
by	1
his	1
father’s	1
advice;	1
and	1
excited	1
and	1
rejoiced,	1
he	1
called	1
Don	1
Fernando	1
and	1
Cardenio	1
and	1
the	1
curate	1
aside,	1
and	1
told	1
them	1
how	1
the	1
matter	1
stood,	1
assuring	1
them	1
that	1
the	1
judge	1
was	1
his	1
brother.	1
The	1
servant	1
had	1
further	1
informed	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
now	1
going	1
to	1
the	1
Indies	1
with	1
the	1
appointment	1
of	1
Judge	1
of	1
the	1
Supreme	1
Court	1
of	1
Mexico;	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
learned,	1
likewise,	1
that	1
the	1
young	1
lady	1
was	1
his	1
daughter,	1
whose	1
mother	1
had	1
died	1
in	1
giving	1
birth	1
to	1
her,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
very	1
rich	1
in	1
consequence	1
of	1
the	1
dowry	1
left	1
to	1
him	1
with	1
the	1
daughter.	1
He	1
asked	1
their	1
advice	1
as	1
to	1
what	1
means	1
he	1
should	1
adopt	1
to	1
make	1
himself	1
known,	1
or	1
to	1
ascertain	1
beforehand	1
whether,	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
made	1
himself	1
known,	1
his	1
brother,	1
seeing	1
him	1
so	1
poor,	1
would	1
be	1
ashamed	1
of	1
him,	1
or	1
would	1
receive	1
him	1
with	1
a	1
warm	1
heart.	1
“Leave	1
it	1
to	1
me	1
to	1
find	1
out	1
that,”	1
said	1
the	1
curate;	1
“though	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
reason	1
for	1
supposing,	1
señor	1
captain,	1
that	1
you	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
kindly	1
received,	1
because	1
the	1
worth	1
and	1
wisdom	1
that	1
your	1
brother’s	1
bearing	1
shows	1
him	1
to	1
possess	1
do	1
not	1
make	1
it	1
likely	1
that	1
he	1
will	1
prove	1
haughty	1
or	1
insensible,	1
or	1
that	1
he	1
will	1
not	1
know	1
how	1
to	1
estimate	1
the	1
accidents	1
of	1
fortune	1
at	1
their	1
proper	1
value.”	1
“Still,”	1
said	1
the	1
captain,	1
“I	1
would	1
not	1
make	1
myself	1
known	1
abruptly,	1
but	1
in	1
some	1
indirect	1
way.”	1
“I	1
have	1
told	1
you	1
already,”	1
said	1
the	1
curate,	1
“that	1
I	1
will	1
manage	1
it	1
in	1
a	1
way	1
to	1
satisfy	1
us	1
all.”	1
By	1
this	1
time	1
supper	1
was	1
ready,	1
and	1
they	1
all	1
took	1
their	1
seats	1
at	1
the	1
table,	1
except	1
the	1
captive,	1
and	1
the	1
ladies,	1
who	1
supped	1
by	1
themselves	1
in	1
their	1
own	1
room.	1
In	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
supper	1
the	1
curate	1
said:	1
“I	1
had	1
a	1
comrade	1
of	1
your	1
worship’s	1
name,	1
Señor	1
Judge,	1
in	1
Constantinople,	1
where	1
I	1
was	1
a	1
captive	1
for	1
several	1
years,	1
and	1
that	1
same	1
comrade	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
stoutest	1
soldiers	1
and	1
captains	1
in	1
the	1
whole	1
Spanish	1
infantry;	1
but	1
he	1
had	1
as	1
large	1
a	1
share	1
of	1
misfortune	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
of	1
gallantry	1
and	1
courage.”	1
“And	1
how	1
was	1
the	1
captain	1
called,	1
señor?”	1
asked	1
the	1
Judge.	1
“He	1
was	1
called	1
Ruy	1
Perez	1
de	1
Viedma,”	1
replied	1
the	1
curate,	1
“and	1
he	1
was	1
born	1
in	1
a	1
village	1
in	1
the	1
mountains	1
of	1
Leon;	1
and	1
he	1
mentioned	1
a	1
circumstance	1
connected	1
with	1
his	1
father	1
and	1
his	1
brothers	1
which,	1
had	1
it	1
not	1
been	1
told	1
me	1
by	1
so	1
truthful	1
a	1
man	1
as	1
he	1
was,	1
I	1
should	1
have	1
set	1
down	1
as	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
fables	1
the	1
old	1
women	1
tell	1
over	1
the	1
fire	1
in	1
winter;	1
for	1
he	1
said	1
his	1
father	1
had	1
divided	1
his	1
property	1
among	1
his	1
three	1
sons	1
and	1
had	1
addressed	1
words	1
of	1
advice	1
to	1
them	1
sounder	1
than	1
any	1
of	1
Cato’s.	1
But	1
I	1
can	1
say	1
this	1
much,	1
that	1
the	1
choice	1
he	1
made	1
of	1
going	1
to	1
the	1
wars	1
was	1
attended	1
with	1
such	1
success,	1
that	1
by	1
his	1
gallant	1
conduct	1
and	1
courage,	1
and	1
without	1
any	1
help	1
save	1
his	1
own	1
merit,	1
he	1
rose	1
in	1
a	1
few	1
years	1
to	1
be	1
captain	1
of	1
infantry,	1
and	1
to	1
see	1
himself	1
on	1
the	1
high-road	1
and	1
in	1
position	1
to	1
be	1
given	1
the	1
command	1
of	1
a	1
corps	1
before	1
long;	1
but	1
Fortune	1
was	1
against	1
him,	1
for	1
where	1
he	1
might	1
have	1
expected	1
her	1
favour	1
he	1
lost	1
it,	1
and	1
with	1
it	1
his	1
liberty,	1
on	1
that	1
glorious	1
day	1
when	1
so	1
many	1
recovered	1
theirs,	1
at	1
the	1
battle	1
of	1
Lepanto.	1
I	1
lost	1
mine	1
at	1
the	1
Goletta,	1
and	1
after	1
a	1
variety	1
of	1
adventures	1
we	1
found	1
ourselves	1
comrades	1
at	1
Constantinople.	1
Thence	1
he	1
went	1
to	1
Algiers,	1
where	1
he	1
met	1
with	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
extraordinary	1
adventures	1
that	1
ever	1
befell	1
anyone	1
in	1
the	1
world.”	1
Here	1
the	1
curate	1
went	1
on	1
to	1
relate	1
briefly	1
his	1
brother’s	1
adventure	1
with	1
Zoraida;	1
to	1
all	1
which	1
the	1
Judge	1
gave	1
such	1
an	1
attentive	1
hearing	1
that	1
he	1
never	1
before	1
had	1
been	1
so	1
much	1
of	1
a	1
hearer.	1
The	1
curate,	1
however,	1
only	1
went	1
so	1
far	1
as	1
to	1
describe	1
how	1
the	1
Frenchmen	1
plundered	1
those	1
who	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
boat,	1
and	1
the	1
poverty	1
and	1
distress	1
in	1
which	1
his	1
comrade	1
and	1
the	1
fair	1
Moor	1
were	1
left,	1
of	1
whom	1
he	1
said	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
able	1
to	1
learn	1
what	1
became	1
of	1
them,	1
or	1
whether	1
they	1
had	1
reached	1
Spain,	1
or	1
been	1
carried	1
to	1
France	1
by	1
the	1
Frenchmen.	1
The	1
captain,	1
standing	1
a	1
little	1
to	1
one	1
side,	1
was	1
listening	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
curate	1
said,	1
and	1
watching	1
every	1
movement	1
of	1
his	1
brother,	1
who,	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
perceived	1
the	1
curate	1
had	1
made	1
an	1
end	1
of	1
his	1
story,	1
gave	1
a	1
deep	1
sigh	1
and	1
said	1
with	1
his	1
eyes	1
full	1
of	1
tears,	1
“Oh,	1
señor,	1
if	1
you	1
only	1
knew	1
what	1
news	1
you	1
have	1
given	1
me	1
and	1
how	1
it	1
comes	1
home	1
to	1
me,	1
making	1
me	1
show	1
how	1
I	1
feel	1
it	1
with	1
these	1
tears	1
that	1
spring	1
from	1
my	1
eyes	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
all	1
my	1
worldly	1
wisdom	1
and	1
self-restraint!	1
That	1
brave	1
captain	1
that	1
you	1
speak	1
of	1
is	1
my	1
eldest	1
brother,	1
who,	1
being	1
of	1
a	1
bolder	1
and	1
loftier	1
mind	1
than	1
my	1
other	1
brother	1
or	1
myself,	1
chose	1
the	1
honourable	1
and	1
worthy	1
calling	1
of	1
arms,	1
which	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
three	1
careers	1
our	1
father	1
proposed	1
to	1
us,	1
as	1
your	1
comrade	1
mentioned	1
in	1
that	1
fable	1
you	1
thought	1
he	1
was	1
telling	1
you.	1
I	1
followed	1
that	1
of	1
letters,	1
in	1
which	1
God	1
and	1
my	1
own	1
exertions	1
have	1
raised	1
me	1
to	1
the	1
position	1
in	1
which	1
you	1
see	1
me.	1
My	1
second	1
brother	1
is	1
in	1
Peru,	1
so	1
wealthy	1
that	1
with	1
what	1
he	1
has	1
sent	1
to	1
my	1
father	1
and	1
to	1
me	1
he	1
has	1
fully	1
repaid	1
the	1
portion	1
he	1
took	1
with	1
him,	1
and	1
has	1
even	1
furnished	1
my	1
father’s	1
hands	1
with	1
the	1
means	1
of	1
gratifying	1
his	1
natural	1
generosity,	1
while	1
I	1
too	1
have	1
been	1
enabled	1
to	1
pursue	1
my	1
studies	1
in	1
a	1
more	1
becoming	1
and	1
creditable	1
fashion,	1
and	1
so	1
to	1
attain	1
my	1
present	1
standing.	1
My	1
father	1
is	1
still	1
alive,	1
though	1
dying	1
with	1
anxiety	1
to	1
hear	1
of	1
his	1
eldest	1
son,	1
and	1
he	1
prays	1
God	1
unceasingly	1
that	1
death	1
may	1
not	1
close	1
his	1
eyes	1
until	1
he	1
has	1
looked	1
upon	1
those	1
of	1
his	1
son;	1
but	1
with	1
regard	1
to	1
him	1
what	1
surprises	1
me	1
is,	1
that	1
having	1
so	1
much	1
common	1
sense	1
as	1
he	1
had,	1
he	1
should	1
have	1
neglected	1
to	1
give	1
any	1
intelligence	1
about	1
himself,	1
either	1
in	1
his	1
troubles	1
and	1
sufferings,	1
or	1
in	1
his	1
prosperity,	1
for	1
if	1
his	1
father	1
or	1
any	1
of	1
us	1
had	1
known	1
of	1
his	1
condition	1
he	1
need	1
not	1
have	1
waited	1
for	1
that	1
miracle	1
of	1
the	1
reed	1
to	1
obtain	1
his	1
ransom;	1
but	1
what	1
now	1
disquiets	1
me	1
is	1
the	1
uncertainty	1
whether	1
those	1
Frenchmen	1
may	1
have	1
restored	1
him	1
to	1
liberty,	1
or	1
murdered	1
him	1
to	1
hide	1
the	1
robbery.	1
All	1
this	1
will	1
make	1
me	1
continue	1
my	1
journey,	1
not	1
with	1
the	1
satisfaction	1
in	1
which	1
I	1
began	1
it,	1
but	1
in	1
the	1
deepest	1
melancholy	1
and	1
sadness.	1
Oh	1
dear	1
brother!	1
that	1
I	1
only	1
knew	1
where	1
thou	1
art	1
now,	1
and	1
I	1
would	1
hasten	1
to	1
seek	1
thee	1
out	1
and	1
deliver	1
thee	1
from	1
thy	1
sufferings,	1
though	1
it	1
were	1
to	1
cost	1
me	1
suffering	1
myself!	1
Oh	1
that	1
I	1
could	1
bring	1
news	1
to	1
our	1
old	1
father	1
that	1
thou	1
art	1
alive,	1
even	1
wert	1
thou	1
in	1
the	1
deepest	1
dungeon	1
of	1
Barbary;	1
for	1
his	1
wealth	1
and	1
my	1
brother’s	1
and	1
mine	1
would	1
rescue	1
thee	1
thence!	1
Oh	1
beautiful	1
and	1
generous	1
Zoraida,	1
that	1
I	1
could	1
repay	1
thy	1
goodness	1
to	1
a	1
brother!	1
That	1
I	1
could	1
be	1
present	1
at	1
the	1
new	1
birth	1
of	1
thy	1
soul,	1
and	1
at	1
thy	1
bridal	1
that	1
would	1
give	1
us	1
all	1
such	1
happiness!”	1
All	1
this	1
and	1
more	1
the	1
Judge	1
uttered	1
with	1
such	1
deep	1
emotion	1
at	1
the	1
news	1
he	1
had	1
received	1
of	1
his	1
brother	1
that	1
all	1
who	1
heard	1
him	1
shared	1
in	1
it,	1
showing	1
their	1
sympathy	1
with	1
his	1
sorrow.	1
The	1
curate,	1
seeing,	1
then,	1
how	1
well	1
he	1
had	1
succeeded	1
in	1
carrying	1
out	1
his	1
purpose	1
and	1
the	1
captain’s	1
wishes,	1
had	1
no	1
desire	1
to	1
keep	1
them	1
unhappy	1
any	1
longer,	1
so	1
he	1
rose	1
from	1
the	1
table	1
and	1
going	1
into	1
the	1
room	1
where	1
Zoraida	1
was	1
he	1
took	1
her	1
by	1
the	1
hand,	1
Luscinda,	1
Dorothea,	1
and	1
the	1
Judge’s	1
daughter	1
following	1
her.	1
The	1
captain	1
was	1
waiting	1
to	1
see	1
what	1
the	1
curate	1
would	1
do,	1
when	1
the	1
latter,	1
taking	1
him	1
with	1
the	1
other	1
hand,	1
advanced	1
with	1
both	1
of	1
them	1
to	1
where	1
the	1
Judge	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
gentlemen	1
were	1
and	1
said,	1
“Let	1
your	1
tears	1
cease	1
to	1
flow,	1
Señor	1
Judge,	1
and	1
the	1
wish	1
of	1
your	1
heart	1
be	1
gratified	1
as	1
fully	1
as	1
you	1
could	1
desire,	1
for	1
you	1
have	1
before	1
you	1
your	1
worthy	1
brother	1
and	1
your	1
good	1
sister-in-law.	1
He	1
whom	1
you	1
see	1
here	1
is	1
the	1
Captain	1
Viedma,	1
and	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
fair	1
Moor	1
who	1
has	1
been	1
so	1
good	1
to	1
him.	1
The	1
Frenchmen	1
I	1
told	1
you	1
of	1
have	1
reduced	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
state	1
of	1
poverty	1
you	1
see	1
that	1
you	1
may	1
show	1
the	1
generosity	1
of	1
your	1
kind	1
heart.”	1
The	1
captain	1
ran	1
to	1
embrace	1
his	1
brother,	1
who	1
placed	1
both	1
hands	1
on	1
his	1
breast	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
good	1
look	1
at	1
him,	1
holding	1
him	1
a	1
little	1
way	1
off	1
but	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
fully	1
recognised	1
him	1
he	1
clasped	1
him	1
in	1
his	1
arms	1
so	1
closely,	1
shedding	1
such	1
tears	1
of	1
heartfelt	1
joy,	1
that	1
most	1
of	1
those	1
present	1
could	1
not	1
but	1
join	1
in	1
them.	1
The	1
words	1
the	1
brothers	1
exchanged,	1
the	1
emotion	1
they	1
showed	1
can	1
scarcely	1
be	1
imagined,	1
I	1
fancy,	1
much	1
less	1
put	1
down	1
in	1
writing.	1
They	1
told	1
each	1
other	1
in	1
a	1
few	1
words	1
the	1
events	1
of	1
their	1
lives;	1
they	1
showed	1
the	1
true	1
affection	1
of	1
brothers	1
in	1
all	1
its	1
strength;	1
then	1
the	1
judge	1
embraced	1
Zoraida,	1
putting	1
all	1
he	1
possessed	1
at	1
her	1
disposal;	1
then	1
he	1
made	1
his	1
daughter	1
embrace	1
her,	1
and	1
the	1
fair	1
Christian	1
and	1
the	1
lovely	1
Moor	1
drew	1
fresh	1
tears	1
from	1
every	1
eye.	1
And	1
there	1
was	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
observing	1
all	1
these	1
strange	1
proceedings	1
attentively	1
without	1
uttering	1
a	1
word,	1
and	1
attributing	1
the	1
whole	1
to	1
chimeras	1
of	1
knight-errantry.	1
Then	1
they	1
agreed	1
that	1
the	1
captain	1
and	1
Zoraida	1
should	1
return	1
with	1
his	1
brother	1
to	1
Seville,	1
and	1
send	1
news	1
to	1
his	1
father	1
of	1
his	1
having	1
been	1
delivered	1
and	1
found,	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
enable	1
him	1
to	1
come	1
and	1
be	1
present	1
at	1
the	1
marriage	1
and	1
baptism	1
of	1
Zoraida,	1
for	1
it	1
was	1
impossible	1
for	1
the	1
Judge	1
to	1
put	1
off	1
his	1
journey,	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
informed	1
that	1
in	1
a	1
month	1
from	1
that	1
time	1
the	1
fleet	1
was	1
to	1
sail	1
from	1
Seville	1
for	1
New	1
Spain,	1
and	1
to	1
miss	1
the	1
passage	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
a	1
great	1
inconvenience	1
to	1
him.	1
In	1
short,	1
everybody	1
was	1
well	1
pleased	1
and	1
glad	1
at	1
the	1
captive’s	1
good	1
fortune;	1
and	1
as	1
now	1
almost	1
two-thirds	1
of	1
the	1
night	1
were	1
past,	1
they	1
resolved	1
to	1
retire	1
to	1
rest	1
for	1
the	1
remainder	1
of	1
it.	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
offered	1
to	1
mount	1
guard	1
over	1
the	1
castle	1
lest	1
they	1
should	1
be	1
attacked	1
by	1
some	1
giant	1
or	1
other	1
malevolent	1
scoundrel,	1
covetous	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
treasure	1
of	1
beauty	1
the	1
castle	1
contained.	1
Those	1
who	1
understood	1
him	1
returned	1
him	1
thanks	1
for	1
this	1
service,	1
and	1
they	1
gave	1
the	1
Judge	1
an	1
account	1
of	1
his	1
extraordinary	1
humour,	1
with	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
little	1
amused.	1
Sancho	1
Panza	1
alone	1
was	1
fuming	1
at	1
the	1
lateness	1
of	1
the	1
hour	1
for	1
retiring	1
to	1
rest;	1
and	1
he	1
of	1
all	1
was	1
the	1
one	1
that	1
made	1
himself	1
most	1
comfortable,	1
as	1
he	1
stretched	1
himself	1
on	1
the	1
trappings	1
of	1
his	1
ass,	1
which,	1
as	1
will	1
be	1
told	1
farther	1
on,	1
cost	1
him	1
so	1
dear.	1
The	1
ladies,	1
then,	1
having	1
retired	1
to	1
their	1
chamber,	1
and	1
the	1
others	1
having	1
disposed	1
themselves	1
with	1
as	1
little	1
discomfort	1
as	1
they	1
could,	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
sallied	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
inn	1
to	1
act	1
as	1
sentinel	1
of	1
the	1
castle	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
promised.	1
It	1
happened,	1
however,	1
that	1
a	1
little	1
before	1
the	1
approach	1
of	1
dawn	1
a	1
voice	1
so	1
musical	1
and	1
sweet	1
reached	1
the	1
ears	1
of	1
the	1
ladies	1
that	1
it	1
forced	1
them	1
all	1
to	1
listen	1
attentively,	1
but	1
especially	1
Dorothea,	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
awake,	1
and	1
by	1
whose	1
side	1
Doña	1
Clara	1
de	1
Viedma,	1
for	1
so	1
the	1
Judge’s	1
daughter	1
was	1
called,	1
lay	1
sleeping.	1
No	1
one	1
could	1
imagine	1
who	1
it	1
was	1
that	1
sang	1
so	1
sweetly,	1
and	1
the	1
voice	1
was	1
unaccompanied	1
by	1
any	1
instrument.	1
At	1
one	1
moment	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
them	1
as	1
if	1
the	1
singer	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
courtyard,	1
at	1
another	1
in	1
the	1
stable;	1
and	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
attention,	1
wondering,	1
Cardenio	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
door	1
and	1
said,	1
“Listen,	1
whoever	1
is	1
not	1
asleep,	1
and	1
you	1
will	1
hear	1
a	1
muleteer’s	1
voice	1
that	1
enchants	1
as	1
it	1
chants.”	1
“We	1
are	1
listening	1
to	1
it	1
already,	1
señor,”	1
said	1
Dorothea;	1
on	1
which	1
Cardenio	1
went	1
away;	1
and	1
Dorothea,	1
giving	1
all	1
her	1
attention	1
to	1
it,	1
made	1
out	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
song	1
to	1
be	1
these:	1

Ah	1
me,	1
Love’s	1
mariner	1
am	1
I	1
On	1
Love’s	1
deep	1
ocean	1
sailing;	1
I	1
know	1
not	1
where	1
the	1
haven	1
lies,	1
I	1
dare	1
not	1
hope	1
to	1
gain	1
it.	1
One	1
solitary	1
distant	1
star	1
Is	1
all	1
I	1
have	1
to	1
guide	1
me,	1
A	1
brighter	1
orb	1
than	1
those	1
of	1
old	1
That	1
Palinurus	1
lighted.	1
And	1
vaguely	1
drifting	1
am	1
I	1
borne,	1
I	1
know	1
not	1
where	1
it	1
leads	1
me;	1
I	1
fix	1
my	1
gaze	1
on	1
it	1
alone,	1
Of	1
all	1
beside	1
it	1
heedless.	1
But	1
over-cautious	1
prudery,	1
And	1
coyness	1
cold	1
and	1
cruel,	1
When	1
most	1
I	1
need	1
it,	1
these,	1
like	1
clouds,	1
Its	1
longed-for	1
light	1
refuse	1
me.	1
Bright	1
star,	1
goal	1
of	1
my	1
yearning	1
eyes	1
As	1
thou	1
above	1
me	1
beamest,	1
When	1
thou	1
shalt	1
hide	1
thee	1
from	1
my	1
sight	1
I’ll	1
know	1
that	1
death	1
is	1
near	1
me.	1
The	1
singer	1
had	1
got	1
so	1
far	1
when	1
it	1
struck	1
Dorothea	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
fair	1
to	1
let	1
Clara	1
miss	1
hearing	1
such	1
a	1
sweet	1
voice,	1
so,	1
shaking	1
her	1
from	1
side	1
to	1
side,	1
she	1
woke	1
her,	1
saying:	1
“Forgive	1
me,	1
child,	1
for	1
waking	1
thee,	1
but	1
I	1
do	1
so	1
that	1
thou	1
mayest	1
have	1
the	1
pleasure	1
of	1
hearing	1
the	1
best	1
voice	1
thou	1
hast	1
ever	1
heard,	1
perhaps,	1
in	1
all	1
thy	1
life.”	1
Clara	1
awoke	1
quite	1
drowsy,	1
and	1
not	1
understanding	1
at	1
the	1
moment	1
what	1
Dorothea	1
said,	1
asked	1
her	1
what	1
it	1
was;	1
she	1
repeated	1
what	1
she	1
had	1
said,	1
and	1
Clara	1
became	1
attentive	1
at	1
once;	1
but	1
she	1
had	1
hardly	1
heard	1
two	1
lines,	1
as	1
the	1
singer	1
continued,	1
when	1
a	1
strange	1
trembling	1
seized	1
her,	1
as	1
if	1
she	1
were	1
suffering	1
from	1
a	1
severe	1
attack	1
of	1
quartan	1
ague,	1
and	1
throwing	1
her	1
arms	1
round	1
Dorothea	1
she	1
said:	1
“Ah,	1
dear	1
lady	1
of	1
my	1
soul	1
and	1
life!	1
why	1
did	1
you	1
wake	1
me?	1
The	1
greatest	1
kindness	1
fortune	1
could	1
do	1
me	1
now	1
would	1
be	1
to	1
close	1
my	1
eyes	1
and	1
ears	1
so	1
as	1
neither	1
to	1
see	1
or	1
hear	1
that	1
unhappy	1
musician.”	1
“What	1
art	1
thou	1
talking	1
about,	1
child?”	1
said	1
Dorothea.	1
“Why,	1
they	1
say	1
this	1
singer	1
is	1
a	1
muleteer!”	1
“Nay,	1
he	1
is	1
the	1
lord	1
of	1
many	1
places,”	1
replied	1
Clara,	1
“and	1
that	1
one	1
in	1
my	1
heart	1
which	1
he	1
holds	1
so	1
firmly	1
shall	1
never	1
be	1
taken	1
from	1
him,	1
unless	1
he	1
be	1
willing	1
to	1
surrender	1
it.”	1
Dorothea	1
was	1
amazed	1
at	1
the	1
ardent	1
language	1
of	1
the	1
girl,	1
for	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
far	1
beyond	1
such	1
experience	1
of	1
life	1
as	1
her	1
tender	1
years	1
gave	1
any	1
promise	1
of,	1
so	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
her:	1
“You	1
speak	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
way	1
that	1
I	1
cannot	1
understand	1
you,	1
Señora	1
Clara;	1
explain	1
yourself	1
more	1
clearly,	1
and	1
tell	1
me	1
what	1
is	1
this	1
you	1
are	1
saying	1
about	1
hearts	1
and	1
places	1
and	1
this	1
musician	1
whose	1
voice	1
has	1
so	1
moved	1
you?	1
But	1
do	1
not	1
tell	1
me	1
anything	1
now;	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
want	1
to	1
lose	1
the	1
pleasure	1
I	1
get	1
from	1
listening	1
to	1
the	1
singer	1
by	1
giving	1
my	1
attention	1
to	1
your	1
transports,	1
for	1
I	1
perceive	1
he	1
is	1
beginning	1
to	1
sing	1
a	1
new	1
strain	1
and	1
a	1
new	1
air.”	1
“Let	1
him,	1
in	1
Heaven’s	1
name,”	1
returned	1
Clara;	1
and	1
not	1
to	1
hear	1
him	1
she	1
stopped	1
both	1
ears	1
with	1
her	1
hands,	1
at	1
which	1
Dorothea	1
was	1
again	1
surprised;	1
but	1
turning	1
her	1
attention	1
to	1
the	1
song	1
she	1
found	1
that	1
it	1
ran	1
in	1
this	1
fashion:	1
Sweet	1
Hope,	1
my	1
stay,	1
That	1
onward	1
to	1
the	1
goal	1
of	1
thy	1
intent	1
Dost	1
make	1
thy	1
way,	1
Heedless	1
of	1
hindrance	1
or	1
impediment,	1
Have	1
thou	1
no	1
fear	1
If	1
at	1
each	1
step	1
thou	1
findest	1
death	1
is	1
near.	1
No	1
victory,	1
No	1
joy	1
of	1
triumph	1
doth	1
the	1
faint	1
heart	1
know;	1
Unblest	1
is	1
he	1
That	1
a	1
bold	1
front	1
to	1
Fortune	1
dares	1
not	1
show,	1
But	1
soul	1
and	1
sense	1
In	1
bondage	1
yieldeth	1
up	1
to	1
indolence.	1
If	1
Love	1
his	1
wares	1
Do	1
dearly	1
sell,	1
his	1
right	1
must	1
be	1
contest;	1
What	1
gold	1
compares	1
With	1
that	1
whereon	1
his	1
stamp	1
he	1
hath	1
imprest?	1
And	1
all	1
men	1
know	1
What	1
costeth	1
little	1
that	1
we	1
rate	1
but	1
low.	1
Love	1
resolute	1
Knows	1
not	1
the	1
word	1
“impossibility;”	1
And	1
though	1
my	1
suit	1
Beset	1
by	1
endless	1
obstacles	1
I	1
see,	1
Yet	1
no	1
despair	1
Shall	1
hold	1
me	1
bound	1
to	1
earth	1
while	1
heaven	1
is	1
there.	1
Here	1
the	1
voice	1
ceased	1
and	1
Clara’s	1
sobs	1
began	1
afresh,	1
all	1
which	1
excited	1
Dorothea’s	1
curiosity	1
to	1
know	1
what	1
could	1
be	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
singing	1
so	1
sweet	1
and	1
weeping	1
so	1
bitter,	1
so	1
she	1
again	1
asked	1
her	1
what	1
it	1
was	1
she	1
was	1
going	1
to	1
say	1
before.	1
On	1
this	1
Clara,	1
afraid	1
that	1
Luscinda	1
might	1
overhear	1
her,	1
winding	1
her	1
arms	1
tightly	1
round	1
Dorothea	1
put	1
her	1
mouth	1
so	1
close	1
to	1
her	1
ear	1
that	1
she	1
could	1
speak	1
without	1
fear	1
of	1
being	1
heard	1
by	1
anyone	1
else,	1
and	1
said:	1
“This	1
singer,	1
dear	1
señora,	1
is	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
a	1
gentleman	1
of	1
Aragon,	1
lord	1
of	1
two	1
villages,	1
who	1
lives	1
opposite	1
my	1
father’s	1
house	1
at	1
Madrid;	1
and	1
though	1
my	1
father	1
had	1
curtains	1
to	1
the	1
windows	1
of	1
his	1
house	1
in	1
winter,	1
and	1
lattice-work	1
in	1
summer,	1
in	1
some	1
way—I	1
know	1
not	1
how—this	1
gentleman,	1
who	1
was	1
pursuing	1
his	1
studies,	1
saw	1
me,	1
whether	1
in	1
church	1
or	1
elsewhere,	1
I	1
cannot	1
tell,	1
and,	1
in	1
fact,	1
fell	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
me,	1
and	1
gave	1
me	1
to	1
know	1
it	1
from	1
the	1
windows	1
of	1
his	1
house,	1
with	1
so	1
many	1
signs	1
and	1
tears	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
forced	1
to	1
believe	1
him,	1
and	1
even	1
to	1
love	1
him,	1
without	1
knowing	1
what	1
it	1
was	1
he	1
wanted	1
of	1
me.	1
One	1
of	1
the	1
signs	1
he	1
used	1
to	1
make	1
me	1
was	1
to	1
link	1
one	1
hand	1
in	1
the	1
other,	1
to	1
show	1
me	1
he	1
wished	1
to	1
marry	1
me;	1
and	1
though	1
I	1
should	1
have	1
been	1
glad	1
if	1
that	1
could	1
be,	1
being	1
alone	1
and	1
motherless	1
I	1
knew	1
not	1
whom	1
to	1
open	1
my	1
mind	1
to,	1
and	1
so	1
I	1
left	1
it	1
as	1
it	1
was,	1
showing	1
him	1
no	1
favour,	1
except	1
when	1
my	1
father,	1
and	1
his	1
too,	1
were	1
from	1
home,	1
to	1
raise	1
the	1
curtain	1
or	1
the	1
lattice	1
a	1
little	1
and	1
let	1
him	1
see	1
me	1
plainly,	1
at	1
which	1
he	1
would	1
show	1
such	1
delight	1
that	1
he	1
seemed	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
were	1
going	1
mad.	1
Meanwhile	1
the	1
time	1
for	1
my	1
father’s	1
departure	1
arrived,	1
which	1
he	1
became	1
aware	1
of,	1
but	1
not	1
from	1
me,	1
for	1
I	1
had	1
never	1
been	1
able	1
to	1
tell	1
him	1
of	1
it.	1
He	1
fell	1
sick,	1
of	1
grief	1
I	1
believe,	1
and	1
so	1
the	1
day	1
we	1
were	1
going	1
away	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
see	1
him	1
to	1
take	1
farewell	1
of	1
him,	1
were	1
it	1
only	1
with	1
the	1
eyes.	1
But	1
after	1
we	1
had	1
been	1
two	1
days	1
on	1
the	1
road,	1
on	1
entering	1
the	1
posada	1
of	1
a	1
village	1
a	1
day’s	1
journey	1
from	1
this,	1
I	1
saw	1
him	1
at	1
the	1
inn	1
door	1
in	1
the	1
dress	1
of	1
a	1
muleteer,	1
and	1
so	1
well	1
disguised,	1
that	1
if	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
carry	1
his	1
image	1
graven	1
on	1
my	1
heart	1
it	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
impossible	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
recognise	1
him.	1
But	1
I	1
knew	1
him,	1
and	1
I	1
was	1
surprised,	1
and	1
glad;	1
he	1
watched	1
me,	1
unsuspected	1
by	1
my	1
father,	1
from	1
whom	1
he	1
always	1
hides	1
himself	1
when	1
he	1
crosses	1
my	1
path	1
on	1
the	1
road,	1
or	1
in	1
the	1
posadas	1
where	1
we	1
halt;	1
and,	1
as	1
I	1
know	1
what	1
he	1
is,	1
and	1
reflect	1
that	1
for	1
love	1
of	1
me	1
he	1
makes	1
this	1
journey	1
on	1
foot	1
in	1
all	1
this	1
hardship,	1
I	1
am	1
ready	1
to	1
die	1
of	1
sorrow;	1
and	1
where	1
he	1
sets	1
foot	1
there	1
I	1
set	1
my	1
eyes.	1
I	1
know	1
not	1
with	1
what	1
object	1
he	1
has	1
come;	1
or	1
how	1
he	1
could	1
have	1
got	1
away	1
from	1
his	1
father,	1
who	1
loves	1
him	1
beyond	1
measure,	1
having	1
no	1
other	1
heir,	1
and	1
because	1
he	1
deserves	1
it,	1
as	1
you	1
will	1
perceive	1
when	1
you	1
see	1
him.	1
And	1
moreover,	1
I	1
can	1
tell	1
you,	1
all	1
that	1
he	1
sings	1
is	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
head;	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
heard	1
them	1
say	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
great	1
scholar	1
and	1
poet;	1
and	1
what	1
is	1
more,	1
every	1
time	1
I	1
see	1
him	1
or	1
hear	1
him	1
sing	1
I	1
tremble	1
all	1
over,	1
and	1
am	1
terrified	1
lest	1
my	1
father	1
should	1
recognise	1
him	1
and	1
come	1
to	1
know	1
of	1
our	1
loves.	1
I	1
have	1
never	1
spoken	1
a	1
word	1
to	1
him	1
in	1
my	1
life;	1
and	1
for	1
all	1
that	1
I	1
love	1
him	1
so	1
that	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
live	1
without	1
him.	1
This,	1
dear	1
señora,	1
is	1
all	1
I	1
have	1
to	1
tell	1
you	1
about	1
the	1
musician	1
whose	1
voice	1
has	1
delighted	1
you	1
so	1
much;	1
and	1
from	1
it	1
alone	1
you	1
might	1
easily	1
perceive	1
he	1
is	1
no	1
muleteer,	1
but	1
a	1
lord	1
of	1
hearts	1
and	1
towns,	1
as	1
I	1
told	1
you	1
already.”	1
“Say	1
no	1
more,	1
Doña	1
Clara,”	1
said	1
Dorothea	1
at	1
this,	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
kissing	1
her	1
a	1
thousand	1
times	1
over,	1
“say	1
no	1
more,	1
I	1
tell	1
you,	1
but	1
wait	1
till	1
day	1
comes;	1
when	1
I	1
trust	1
in	1
God	1
to	1
arrange	1
this	1
affair	1
of	1
yours	1
so	1
that	1
it	1
may	1
have	1
the	1
happy	1
ending	1
such	1
an	1
innocent	1
beginning	1
deserves.”	1
“Ah,	1
señora,”	1
said	1
Doña	1
Clara,	1
“what	1
end	1
can	1
be	1
hoped	1
for	1
when	1
his	1
father	1
is	1
of	1
such	1
lofty	1
position,	1
and	1
so	1
wealthy,	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
think	1
I	1
was	1
not	1
fit	1
to	1
be	1
even	1
a	1
servant	1
to	1
his	1
son,	1
much	1
less	1
wife?	1
And	1
as	1
to	1
marrying	1
without	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
my	1
father,	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
do	1
it	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
world.	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
ask	1
anything	1
more	1
than	1
that	1
this	1
youth	1
should	1
go	1
back	1
and	1
leave	1
me;	1
perhaps	1
with	1
not	1
seeing	1
him,	1
and	1
the	1
long	1
distance	1
we	1
shall	1
have	1
to	1
travel,	1
the	1
pain	1
I	1
suffer	1
now	1
may	1
become	1
easier;	1
though	1
I	1
daresay	1
the	1
remedy	1
I	1
propose	1
will	1
do	1
me	1
very	1
little	1
good.	1
I	1
don’t	1
know	1
how	1
the	1
devil	1
this	1
has	1
come	1
about,	1
or	1
how	1
this	1
love	1
I	1
have	1
for	1
him	1
got	1
in;	1
I	1
such	1
a	1
young	1
girl,	1
and	1
he	1
such	1
a	1
mere	1
boy;	1
for	1
I	1
verily	1
believe	1
we	1
are	1
both	1
of	1
an	1
age,	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
sixteen	1
yet;	1
for	1
I	1
will	1
be	1
sixteen	1
Michaelmas	1
Day,	1
next,	1
my	1
father	1
says.”	1
Dorothea	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
laughing	1
to	1
hear	1
how	1
like	1
a	1
child	1
Doña	1
Clara	1
spoke.	1
“Let	1
us	1
go	1
to	1
sleep	1
now,	1
señora,”	1
said	1
she,	1
“for	1
the	1
little	1
of	1
the	1
night	1
that	1
I	1
fancy	1
is	1
left	1
to	1
us:	1
God	1
will	1
soon	1
send	1
us	1
daylight,	1
and	1
we	1
will	1
set	1
all	1
to	1
rights,	1
or	1
it	1
will	1
go	1
hard	1
with	1
me.”	1
With	1
this	1
they	1
fell	1
asleep,	1
and	1
deep	1
silence	1
reigned	1
all	1
through	1
the	1
inn.	1
The	1
only	1
persons	1
not	1
asleep	1
were	1
the	1
landlady’s	1
daughter	1
and	1
her	1
servant	1
Maritornes,	1
who,	1
knowing	1
the	1
weak	1
point	1
of	1
Don	1
Quixote’s	1
humour,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
outside	1
the	1
inn	1
mounting	1
guard	1
in	1
armour	1
and	1
on	1
horseback,	1
resolved,	1
the	1
pair	1
of	1
them,	1
to	1
play	1
some	1
trick	1
upon	1
him,	1
or	1
at	1
any	1
rate	1
to	1
amuse	1
themselves	1
for	1
a	1
while	1
by	1
listening	1
to	1
his	1
nonsense.	1
As	1
it	1
so	1
happened	1
there	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
window	1
in	1
the	1
whole	1
inn	1
that	1
looked	1
outwards	1
except	1
a	1
hole	1
in	1
the	1
wall	1
of	1
a	1
straw-loft	1
through	1
which	1
they	1
used	1
to	1
throw	1
out	1
the	1
straw.	1
At	1
this	1
hole	1
the	1
two	1
demi-damsels	1
posted	1
themselves,	1
and	1
observed	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
on	1
his	1
horse,	1
leaning	1
on	1
his	1
pike	1
and	1
from	1
time	1
to	1
time	1
sending	1
forth	1
such	1
deep	1
and	1
doleful	1
sighs,	1
that	1
he	1
seemed	1
to	1
pluck	1
up	1
his	1
soul	1
by	1
the	1
roots	1
with	1
each	1
of	1
them;	1
and	1
they	1
could	1
hear	1
him,	1
too,	1
saying	1
in	1
a	1
soft,	1
tender,	1
loving	1
tone,	1
“Oh	1
my	1
lady	1
Dulcinea	1
del	1
Toboso,	1
perfection	1
of	1
all	1
beauty,	1
summit	1
and	1
crown	1
of	1
discretion,	1
treasure	1
house	1
of	1
grace,	1
depositary	1
of	1
virtue,	1
and	1
finally,	1
ideal	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
is	1
good,	1
honourable,	1
and	1
delectable	1
in	1
this	1
world!	1
What	1
is	1
thy	1
grace	1
doing	1
now?	1
Art	1
thou,	1
perchance,	1
mindful	1
of	1
thy	1
enslaved	1
knight	1
who	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
free	1
will	1
hath	1
exposed	1
himself	1
to	1
so	1
great	1
perils,	1
and	1
all	1
to	1
serve	1
thee?	1
Give	1
me	1
tidings	1
of	1
her,	1
oh	1
luminary	1
of	1
the	1
three	1
faces!	1
Perhaps	1
at	1
this	1
moment,	1
envious	1
of	1
hers,	1
thou	1
art	1
regarding	1
her,	1
either	1
as	1
she	1
paces	1
to	1
and	1
fro	1
some	1
gallery	1
of	1
her	1
sumptuous	1
palaces,	1
or	1
leans	1
over	1
some	1
balcony,	1
meditating	1
how,	1
whilst	1
preserving	1
her	1
purity	1
and	1
greatness,	1
she	1
may	1
mitigate	1
the	1
tortures	1
this	1
wretched	1
heart	1
of	1
mine	1
endures	1
for	1
her	1
sake,	1
what	1
glory	1
should	1
recompense	1
my	1
sufferings,	1
what	1
repose	1
my	1
toil,	1
and	1
lastly	1
what	1
death	1
my	1
life,	1
and	1
what	1
reward	1
my	1
services?	1
And	1
thou,	1
oh	1
sun,	1
that	1
art	1
now	1
doubtless	1
harnessing	1
thy	1
steeds	1
in	1
haste	1
to	1
rise	1
betimes	1
and	1
come	1
forth	1
to	1
see	1
my	1
lady;	1
when	1
thou	1
seest	1
her	1
I	1
entreat	1
of	1
thee	1
to	1
salute	1
her	1
on	1
my	1
behalf:	1
but	1
have	1
a	1
care,	1
when	1
thou	1
shalt	1
see	1
her	1
and	1
salute	1
her,	1
that	1
thou	1
kiss	1
not	1
her	1
face;	1
for	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
more	1
jealous	1
of	1
thee	1
than	1
thou	1
wert	1
of	1
that	1
light-footed	1
ingrate	1
that	1
made	1
thee	1
sweat	1
and	1
run	1
so	1
on	1
the	1
plains	1
of	1
Thessaly,	1
or	1
on	1
the	1
banks	1
of	1
the	1
Peneus	1
(for	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
exactly	1
recollect	1
where	1
it	1
was	1
thou	1
didst	1
run	1
on	1
that	1
occasion)	1
in	1
thy	1
jealousy	1
and	1
love.”	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
had	1
got	1
so	1
far	1
in	1
his	1
pathetic	1
speech	1
when	1
the	1
landlady’s	1
daughter	1
began	1
to	1
signal	1
to	1
him,	1
saying,	1
“Señor,	1
come	1
over	1
here,	1
please.”	1
At	1
these	1
signals	1
and	1
voice	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
turned	1
his	1
head	1
and	1
saw	1
by	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
the	1
moon,	1
which	1
then	1
was	1
in	1
its	1
full	1
splendour,	1
that	1
someone	1
was	1
calling	1
to	1
him	1
from	1
the	1
hole	1
in	1
the	1
wall,	1
which	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
window,	1
and	1
what	1
is	1
more,	1
with	1
a	1
gilt	1
grating,	1
as	1
rich	1
castles,	1
such	1
as	1
he	1
believed	1
the	1
inn	1
to	1
be,	1
ought	1
to	1
have;	1
and	1
it	1
immediately	1
suggested	1
itself	1
to	1
his	1
imagination	1
that,	1
as	1
on	1
the	1
former	1
occasion,	1
the	1
fair	1
damsel,	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
the	1
lady	1
of	1
the	1
castle,	1
overcome	1
by	1
love	1
for	1
him,	1
was	1
once	1
more	1
endeavouring	1
to	1
win	1
his	1
affections;	1
and	1
with	1
this	1
idea,	1
not	1
to	1
show	1
himself	1
discourteous,	1
or	1
ungrateful,	1
he	1
turned	1
Rocinante’s	1
head	1
and	1
approached	1
the	1
hole,	1
and	1
as	1
he	1
perceived	1
the	1
two	1
wenches	1
he	1
said:	1
“I	1
pity	1
you,	1
beauteous	1
lady,	1
that	1
you	1
should	1
have	1
directed	1
your	1
thoughts	1
of	1
love	1
to	1
a	1
quarter	1
from	1
whence	1
it	1
is	1
impossible	1
that	1
such	1
a	1
return	1
can	1
be	1
made	1
to	1
you	1
as	1
is	1
due	1
to	1
your	1
great	1
merit	1
and	1
gentle	1
birth,	1
for	1
which	1
you	1
must	1
not	1
blame	1
this	1
unhappy	1
knight-errant	1
whom	1
love	1
renders	1
incapable	1
of	1
submission	1
to	1
any	1
other	1
than	1
her	1
whom,	1
the	1
first	1
moment	1
his	1
eyes	1
beheld	1
her,	1
he	1
made	1
absolute	1
mistress	1
of	1
his	1
soul.	1
Forgive	1
me,	1
noble	1
lady,	1
and	1
retire	1
to	1
your	1
apartment,	1
and	1
do	1
not,	1
by	1
any	1
further	1
declaration	1
of	1
your	1
passion,	1
compel	1
me	1
to	1
show	1
myself	1
more	1
ungrateful;	1
and	1
if,	1
of	1
the	1
love	1
you	1
bear	1
me,	1
you	1
should	1
find	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
anything	1
else	1
in	1
my	1
power	1
wherein	1
I	1
can	1
gratify	1
you,	1
provided	1
it	1
be	1
not	1
love	1
itself,	1
demand	1
it	1
of	1
me;	1
for	1
I	1
swear	1
to	1
you	1
by	1
that	1
sweet	1
absent	1
enemy	1
of	1
mine	1
to	1
grant	1
it	1
this	1
instant,	1
though	1
it	1
be	1
that	1
you	1
require	1
of	1
me	1
a	1
lock	1
of	1
Medusa’s	1
hair,	1
which	1
was	1
all	1
snakes,	1
or	1
even	1
the	1
very	1
beams	1
of	1
the	1
sun	1
shut	1
up	1
in	1
a	1
vial.”	1
“My	1
mistress	1
wants	1
nothing	1
of	1
that	1
sort,	1
sir	1
knight,”	1
said	1
Maritornes	1
at	1
this.	1
“What	1
then,	1
discreet	1
dame,	1
is	1
it	1
that	1
your	1
mistress	1
wants?”	1
replied	1
Don	1
Quixote.	1
“Only	1
one	1
of	1
your	1
fair	1
hands,”	1
said	1
Maritornes,	1
“to	1
enable	1
her	1
to	1
vent	1
over	1
it	1
the	1
great	1
passion,	1
passion	1
which	1
has	1
brought	1
her	1
to	1
this	1
loophole,	1
so	1
much	1
to	1
the	1
risk	1
of	1
her	1
honour;	1
for	1
if	1
the	1
lord	1
her	1
father	1
had	1
heard	1
her,	1
the	1
least	1
slice	1
he	1
would	1
cut	1
off	1
her	1
would	1
be	1
her	1
ear.”	1
“I	1
should	1
like	1
to	1
see	1
that	1
tried,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
“but	1
he	1
had	1
better	1
beware	1
of	1
that,	1
if	1
he	1
does	1
not	1
want	1
to	1
meet	1
the	1
most	1
disastrous	1
end	1
that	1
ever	1
father	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
met	1
for	1
having	1
laid	1
hands	1
on	1
the	1
tender	1
limbs	1
of	1
a	1
love-stricken	1
daughter.”	1
Maritornes	1
felt	1
sure	1
that	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
would	1
present	1
the	1
hand	1
she	1
had	1
asked,	1
and	1
making	1
up	1
her	1
mind	1
what	1
to	1
do,	1
she	1
got	1
down	1
from	1
the	1
hole	1
and	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
stable,	1
where	1
she	1
took	1
the	1
halter	1
of	1
Sancho	1
Panza’s	1
ass,	1
and	1
in	1
all	1
haste	1
returned	1
to	1
the	1
hole,	1
just	1
as	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
had	1
planted	1
himself	1
standing	1
on	1
Rocinante’s	1
saddle	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
reach	1
the	1
grated	1
window	1
where	1
he	1
supposed	1
the	1
lovelorn	1
damsel	1
to	1
be;	1
and	1
giving	1
her	1
his	1
hand,	1
he	1
said,	1
“Lady,	1
take	1
this	1
hand,	1
or	1
rather	1
this	1
scourge	1
of	1
the	1
evil-doers	1
of	1
the	1
earth;	1
take,	1
I	1
say,	1
this	1
hand	1
which	1
no	1
other	1
hand	1
of	1
woman	1
has	1
ever	1
touched,	1
not	1
even	1
hers	1
who	1
has	1
complete	1
possession	1
of	1
my	1
entire	1
body.	1
I	1
present	1
it	1
to	1
you,	1
not	1
that	1
you	1
may	1
kiss	1
it,	1
but	1
that	1
you	1
may	1
observe	1
the	1
contexture	1
of	1
the	1
sinews,	1
the	1
close	1
network	1
of	1
the	1
muscles,	1
the	1
breadth	1
and	1
capacity	1
of	1
the	1
veins,	1
whence	1
you	1
may	1
infer	1
what	1
must	1
be	1
the	1
strength	1
of	1
the	1
arm	1
that	1
has	1
such	1
a	1
hand.”	1
“That	1
we	1
shall	1
see	1
presently,”	1
said	1
Maritornes,	1
and	1
making	1
a	1
running	1
knot	1
on	1
the	1
halter,	1
she	1
passed	1
it	1
over	1
his	1
wrist	1
and	1
coming	1
down	1
from	1
the	1
hole	1
tied	1
the	1
other	1
end	1
very	1
firmly	1
to	1
the	1
bolt	1
of	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
straw-loft.	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
feeling	1
the	1
roughness	1
of	1
the	1
rope	1
on	1
his	1
wrist,	1
exclaimed,	1
“Your	1
grace	1
seems	1
to	1
be	1
grating	1
rather	1
than	1
caressing	1
my	1
hand;	1
treat	1
it	1
not	1
so	1
harshly,	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
to	1
blame	1
for	1
the	1
offence	1
my	1
resolution	1
has	1
given	1
you,	1
nor	1
is	1
it	1
just	1
to	1
wreak	1
all	1
your	1
vengeance	1
on	1
so	1
small	1
a	1
part;	1
remember	1
that	1
one	1
who	1
loves	1
so	1
well	1
should	1
not	1
revenge	1
herself	1
so	1
cruelly.”	1
But	1
there	1
was	1
nobody	1
now	1
to	1
listen	1
to	1
these	1
words	1
of	1
Don	1
Quixote’s,	1
for	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
Maritornes	1
had	1
tied	1
him	1
she	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
made	1
off,	1
ready	1
to	1
die	1
with	1
laughing,	1
leaving	1
him	1
fastened	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
way	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
impossible	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
release	1
himself.	1
He	1
was,	1
as	1
has	1
been	1
said,	1
standing	1
on	1
Rocinante,	1
with	1
his	1
arm	1
passed	1
through	1
the	1
hole	1
and	1
his	1
wrist	1
tied	1
to	1
the	1
bolt	1
of	1
the	1
door,	1
and	1
in	1
mighty	1
fear	1
and	1
dread	1
of	1
being	1
left	1
hanging	1
by	1
the	1
arm	1
if	1
Rocinante	1
were	1
to	1
stir	1
one	1
side	1
or	1
the	1
other;	1
so	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
dare	1
to	1
make	1
the	1
least	1
movement,	1
although	1
from	1
the	1
patience	1
and	1
imperturbable	1
disposition	1
of	1
Rocinante,	1
he	1
had	1
good	1
reason	1
to	1
expect	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
stand	1
without	1
budging	1
for	1
a	1
whole	1
century.	1
Finding	1
himself	1
fast,	1
then,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
ladies	1
had	1
retired,	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
fancy	1
that	1
all	1
this	1
was	1
done	1
by	1
enchantment,	1
as	1
on	1
the	1
former	1
occasion	1
when	1
in	1
that	1
same	1
castle	1
that	1
enchanted	1
Moor	1
of	1
a	1
carrier	1
had	1
belaboured	1
him;	1
and	1
he	1
cursed	1
in	1
his	1
heart	1
his	1
own	1
want	1
of	1
sense	1
and	1
judgment	1
in	1
venturing	1
to	1
enter	1
the	1
castle	1
again,	1
after	1
having	1
come	1
off	1
so	1
badly	1
the	1
first	1
time;	1
it	1
being	1
a	1
settled	1
point	1
with	1
knights-errant	1
that	1
when	1
they	1
have	1
tried	1
an	1
adventure,	1
and	1
have	1
not	1
succeeded	1
in	1
it,	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
sign	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
reserved	1
for	1
them	1
but	1
for	1
others,	1
and	1
that	1
therefore	1
they	1
need	1
not	1
try	1
it	1
again.	1
Nevertheless	1
he	1
pulled	1
his	1
arm	1
to	1
see	1
if	1
he	1
could	1
release	1
himself,	1
but	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
made	1
so	1
fast	1
that	1
all	1
his	1
efforts	1
were	1
in	1
vain.	1
It	1
is	1
true	1
he	1
pulled	1
it	1
gently	1
lest	1
Rocinante	1
should	1
move,	1
but	1
try	1
as	1
he	1
might	1
to	1
seat	1
himself	1
in	1
the	1
saddle,	1
he	1
had	1
nothing	1
for	1
it	1
but	1
to	1
stand	1
upright	1
or	1
pull	1
his	1
hand	1
off.	1
Then	1
it	1
was	1
he	1
wished	1
for	1
the	1
sword	1
of	1
Amadis,	1
against	1
which	1
no	1
enchantment	1
whatever	1
had	1
any	1
power;	1
then	1
he	1
cursed	1
his	1
ill	1
fortune;	1
then	1
he	1
magnified	1
the	1
loss	1
the	1
world	1
would	1
sustain	1
by	1
his	1
absence	1
while	1
he	1
remained	1
there	1
enchanted,	1
for	1
that	1
he	1
believed	1
he	1
was	1
beyond	1
all	1
doubt;	1
then	1
he	1
once	1
more	1
took	1
to	1
thinking	1
of	1
his	1
beloved	1
Dulcinea	1
del	1
Toboso;	1
then	1
he	1
called	1
to	1
his	1
worthy	1
squire	1
Sancho	1
Panza,	1
who,	1
buried	1
in	1
sleep	1
and	1
stretched	1
upon	1
the	1
pack-saddle	1
of	1
his	1
ass,	1
was	1
oblivious,	1
at	1
that	1
moment,	1
of	1
the	1
mother	1
that	1
bore	1
him;	1
then	1
he	1
called	1
upon	1
the	1
sages	1
Lirgandeo	1
and	1
Alquife	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
his	1
aid;	1
then	1
he	1
invoked	1
his	1
good	1
friend	1
Urganda	1
to	1
succour	1
him;	1
and	1
then,	1
at	1
last,	1
morning	1
found	1
him	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
state	1
of	1
desperation	1
and	1
perplexity	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
bellowing	1
like	1
a	1
bull,	1
for	1
he	1
had	1
no	1
hope	1
that	1
day	1
would	1
bring	1
any	1
relief	1
to	1
his	1
suffering,	1
which	1
he	1
believed	1
would	1
last	1
for	1
ever,	1
inasmuch	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
enchanted;	1
and	1
of	1
this	1
he	1
was	1
convinced	1
by	1
seeing	1
that	1
Rocinante	1
never	1
stirred,	1
much	1
or	1
little,	1
and	1
he	1
felt	1
persuaded	1
that	1
he	1
and	1
his	1
horse	1
were	1
to	1
remain	1
in	1
this	1
state,	1
without	1
eating	1
or	1
drinking	1
or	1
sleeping,	1
until	1
the	1
malign	1
influence	1
of	1
the	1
stars	1
was	1
overpast,	1
or	1
until	1
some	1
other	1
more	1
sage	1
enchanter	1
should	1
disenchant	1
him.	1
But	1
he	1
was	1
very	1
much	1
deceived	1
in	1
this	1
conclusion,	1
for	1
daylight	1
had	1
hardly	1
begun	1
to	1
appear	1
when	1
there	1
came	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
inn	1
four	1
men	1
on	1
horseback,	1
well	1
equipped	1
and	1
accoutred,	1
with	1
firelocks	1
across	1
their	1
saddle-bows.	1
They	1
called	1
out	1
and	1
knocked	1
loudly	1
at	1
the	1
gate	1
of	1
the	1
inn,	1
which	1
was	1
still	1
shut;	1
on	1
seeing	1
which,	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
even	1
there	1
where	1
he	1
was,	1
did	1
not	1
forget	1
to	1
act	1
as	1
sentinel,	1
and	1
said	1
in	1
a	1
loud	1
and	1
imperious	1
tone,	1
“Knights,	1
or	1
squires,	1
or	1
whatever	1
ye	1
be,	1
ye	1
have	1
no	1
right	1
to	1
knock	1
at	1
the	1
gates	1
of	1
this	1
castle;	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
plain	1
enough	1
that	1
they	1
who	1
are	1
within	1
are	1
either	1
asleep,	1
or	1
else	1
are	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
habit	1
of	1
throwing	1
open	1
the	1
fortress	1
until	1
the	1
sun’s	1
rays	1
are	1
spread	1
over	1
the	1
whole	1
surface	1
of	1
the	1
earth.	1
Withdraw	1
to	1
a	1
distance,	1
and	1
wait	1
till	1
it	1
is	1
broad	1
daylight,	1
and	1
then	1
we	1
shall	1
see	1
whether	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
proper	1
or	1
not	1
to	1
open	1
to	1
you.”	1
“What	1
the	1
devil	1
fortress	1
or	1
castle	1
is	1
this,”	1
said	1
one,	1
“to	1
make	1
us	1
stand	1
on	1
such	1
ceremony?	1
If	1
you	1
are	1
the	1
innkeeper	1
bid	1
them	1
open	1
to	1
us;	1
we	1
are	1
travellers	1
who	1
only	1
want	1
to	1
feed	1
our	1
horses	1
and	1
go	1
on,	1
for	1
we	1
are	1
in	1
haste.”	1
“Do	1
you	1
think,	1
gentlemen,	1
that	1
I	1
look	1
like	1
an	1
innkeeper?”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote.	1
“I	1
don’t	1
know	1
what	1
you	1
look	1
like,”	1
replied	1
the	1
other;	1
“but	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
you	1
are	1
talking	1
nonsense	1
when	1
you	1
call	1
this	1
inn	1
a	1
castle.”	1
“A	1
castle	1
it	1
is,”	1
returned	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“nay,	1
more,	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
best	1
in	1
this	1
whole	1
province,	1
and	1
it	1
has	1
within	1
it	1
people	1
who	1
have	1
had	1
the	1
sceptre	1
in	1
the	1
hand	1
and	1
the	1
crown	1
on	1
the	1
head.”	1
“It	1
would	1
be	1
better	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
the	1
other	1
way,”	1
said	1
the	1
traveller,	1
“the	1
sceptre	1
on	1
the	1
head	1
and	1
the	1
crown	1
in	1
the	1
hand;	1
but	1
if	1
so,	1
maybe	1
there	1
is	1
within	1
some	1
company	1
of	1
players,	1
with	1
whom	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
common	1
thing	1
to	1
have	1
those	1
crowns	1
and	1
sceptres	1
you	1
speak	1
of;	1
for	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
small	1
inn	1
as	1
this,	1
and	1
where	1
such	1
silence	1
is	1
kept,	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
believe	1
any	1
people	1
entitled	1
to	1
crowns	1
and	1
sceptres	1
can	1
have	1
taken	1
up	1
their	1
quarters.”	1
“You	1
know	1
but	1
little	1
of	1
the	1
world,”	1
returned	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“since	1
you	1
are	1
ignorant	1
of	1
what	1
commonly	1
occurs	1
in	1
knight-errantry.”	1
But	1
the	1
comrades	1
of	1
the	1
spokesman,	1
growing	1
weary	1
of	1
the	1
dialogue	1
with	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
renewed	1
their	1
knocks	1
with	1
great	1
vehemence,	1
so	1
much	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
host,	1
and	1
not	1
only	1
he	1
but	1
everybody	1
in	1
the	1
inn,	1
awoke,	1
and	1
he	1
got	1
up	1
to	1
ask	1
who	1
knocked.	1
It	1
happened	1
at	1
this	1
moment	1
that	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
horses	1
of	1
the	1
four	1
who	1
were	1
seeking	1
admittance	1
went	1
to	1
smell	1
Rocinante,	1
who	1
melancholy,	1
dejected,	1
and	1
with	1
drooping	1
ears	1
stood	1
motionless,	1
supporting	1
his	1
sorely	1
stretched	1
master;	1
and	1
as	1
he	1
was,	1
after	1
all,	1
flesh,	1
though	1
he	1
looked	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
were	1
made	1
of	1
wood,	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
giving	1
way	1
and	1
in	1
return	1
smelling	1
the	1
one	1
who	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
offer	1
him	1
attentions.	1
But	1
he	1
had	1
hardly	1
moved	1
at	1
all	1
when	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
lost	1
his	1
footing;	1
and	1
slipping	1
off	1
the	1
saddle,	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
ground,	1
but	1
for	1
being	1
suspended	1
by	1
the	1
arm,	1
which	1
caused	1
him	1
such	1
agony	1
that	1
he	1
believed	1
either	1
his	1
wrist	1
would	1
be	1
cut	1
through	1
or	1
his	1
arm	1
torn	1
off;	1
and	1
he	1
hung	1
so	1
near	1
the	1
ground	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
just	1
touch	1
it	1
with	1
his	1
feet,	1
which	1
was	1
all	1
the	1
worse	1
for	1
him;	1
for,	1
finding	1
how	1
little	1
was	1
wanted	1
to	1
enable	1
him	1
to	1
plant	1
his	1
feet	1
firmly,	1
he	1
struggled	1
and	1
stretched	1
himself	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
he	1
could	1
to	1
gain	1
a	1
footing;	1
just	1
like	1
those	1
undergoing	1
the	1
torture	1
of	1
the	1
strappado,	1
when	1
they	1
are	1
fixed	1
at	1
“touch	1
and	1
no	1
touch,”	1
who	1
aggravate	1
their	1
own	1
sufferings	1
by	1
their	1
violent	1
efforts	1
to	1
stretch	1
themselves,	1
deceived	1
by	1
the	1
hope	1
which	1
makes	1
them	1
fancy	1
that	1
with	1
a	1
very	1
little	1
more	1
they	1
will	1
reach	1
the	1
ground.	1

So	1
loud,	1
in	1
fact,	1
were	1
the	1
shouts	1
of	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
that	1
the	1
landlord	1
opening	1
the	1
gate	1
of	1
the	1
inn	1
in	1
all	1
haste,	1
came	1
out	1
in	1
dismay,	1
and	1
ran	1
to	1
see	1
who	1
was	1
uttering	1
such	1
cries,	1
and	1
those	1
who	1
were	1
outside	1
joined	1
him.	1
Maritornes,	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
by	1
this	1
time	1
roused	1
up	1
by	1
the	1
same	1
outcry,	1
suspecting	1
what	1
it	1
was,	1
ran	1
to	1
the	1
loft	1
and,	1
without	1
anyone	1
seeing	1
her,	1
untied	1
the	1
halter	1
by	1
which	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
was	1
suspended,	1
and	1
down	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
ground	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
landlord	1
and	1
the	1
travellers,	1
who	1
approaching	1
asked	1
him	1
what	1
was	1
the	1
matter	1
with	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
shouted	1
so.	1
He	1
without	1
replying	1
a	1
word	1
took	1
the	1
rope	1
off	1
his	1
wrist,	1
and	1
rising	1
to	1
his	1
feet	1
leaped	1
upon	1
Rocinante,	1
braced	1
his	1
buckler	1
on	1
his	1
arm,	1
put	1
his	1
lance	1
in	1
rest,	1
and	1
making	1
a	1
considerable	1
circuit	1
of	1
the	1
plain	1
came	1
back	1
at	1
a	1
half-gallop	1
exclaiming:	1
“Whoever	1
shall	1
say	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
enchanted	1
with	1
just	1
cause,	1
provided	1
my	1
lady	1
the	1
Princess	1
Micomicona	1
grants	1
me	1
permission	1
to	1
do	1
so,	1
I	1
give	1
him	1
the	1
lie,	1
challenge	1
him	1
and	1
defy	1
him	1
to	1
single	1
combat.”	1
The	1
newly	1
arrived	1
travellers	1
were	1
amazed	1
at	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
but	1
the	1
landlord	1
removed	1
their	1
surprise	1
by	1
telling	1
them	1
who	1
he	1
was,	1
and	1
not	1
to	1
mind	1
him	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
senses.	1
They	1
then	1
asked	1
the	1
landlord	1
if	1
by	1
any	1
chance	1
a	1
youth	1
of	1
about	1
fifteen	1
years	1
of	1
age	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
that	1
inn,	1
one	1
dressed	1
like	1
a	1
muleteer,	1
and	1
of	1
such	1
and	1
such	1
an	1
appearance,	1
describing	1
that	1
of	1
Doña	1
Clara’s	1
lover.	1
The	1
landlord	1
replied	1
that	1
there	1
were	1
so	1
many	1
people	1
in	1
the	1
inn	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
noticed	1
the	1
person	1
they	1
were	1
inquiring	1
for;	1
but	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
observing	1
the	1
coach	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
Judge	1
had	1
come,	1
said,	1
“He	1
is	1
here	1
no	1
doubt,	1
for	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
coach	1
he	1
is	1
following:	1
let	1
one	1
of	1
us	1
stay	1
at	1
the	1
gate,	1
and	1
the	1
rest	1
go	1
in	1
to	1
look	1
for	1
him;	1
or	1
indeed	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
as	1
well	1
if	1
one	1
of	1
us	1
went	1
round	1
the	1
inn,	1
lest	1
he	1
should	1
escape	1
over	1
the	1
wall	1
of	1
the	1
yard.”	1
“So	1
be	1
it,”	1
said	1
another;	1
and	1
while	1
two	1
of	1
them	1
went	1
in,	1
one	1
remained	1
at	1
the	1
gate	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
made	1
the	1
circuit	1
of	1
the	1
inn;	1
observing	1
all	1
which,	1
the	1
landlord	1
was	1
unable	1
to	1
conjecture	1
for	1
what	1
reason	1
they	1
were	1
taking	1
all	1
these	1
precautions,	1
though	1
he	1
understood	1
they	1
were	1
looking	1
for	1
the	1
youth	1
whose	1
description	1
they	1
had	1
given	1
him.	1
It	1
was	1
by	1
this	1
time	1
broad	1
daylight;	1
and	1
for	1
that	1
reason,	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
in	1
consequence	1
of	1
the	1
noise	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
had	1
made,	1
everybody	1
was	1
awake	1
and	1
up,	1
but	1
particularly	1
Doña	1
Clara	1
and	1
Dorothea;	1
for	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
able	1
to	1
sleep	1
but	1
badly	1
that	1
night,	1
the	1
one	1
from	1
agitation	1
at	1
having	1
her	1
lover	1
so	1
near	1
her,	1
the	1
other	1
from	1
curiosity	1
to	1
see	1
him.	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
that	1
not	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
four	1
travellers	1
took	1
any	1
notice	1
of	1
him	1
or	1
replied	1
to	1
his	1
challenge,	1
was	1
furious	1
and	1
ready	1
to	1
die	1
with	1
indignation	1
and	1
wrath;	1
and	1
if	1
he	1
could	1
have	1
found	1
in	1
the	1
ordinances	1
of	1
chivalry	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
lawful	1
for	1
a	1
knight-errant	1
to	1
undertake	1
or	1
engage	1
in	1
another	1
enterprise,	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
plighted	1
his	1
word	1
and	1
faith	1
not	1
to	1
involve	1
himself	1
in	1
any	1
until	1
he	1
had	1
made	1
an	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
one	1
to	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
pledged,	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
attacked	1
the	1
whole	1
of	1
them,	1
and	1
would	1
have	1
made	1
them	1
return	1
an	1
answer	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
themselves.	1
But	1
considering	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
not	1
become	1
him,	1
nor	1
be	1
right,	1
to	1
begin	1
any	1
new	1
emprise	1
until	1
he	1
had	1
established	1
Micomicona	1
in	1
her	1
kingdom,	1
he	1
was	1
constrained	1
to	1
hold	1
his	1
peace	1
and	1
wait	1
quietly	1
to	1
see	1
what	1
would	1
be	1
the	1
upshot	1
of	1
the	1
proceedings	1
of	1
those	1
same	1
travellers;	1
one	1
of	1
whom	1
found	1
the	1
youth	1
they	1
were	1
seeking	1
lying	1
asleep	1
by	1
the	1
side	1
of	1
a	1
muleteer,	1
without	1
a	1
thought	1
of	1
anyone	1
coming	1
in	1
search	1
of	1
him,	1
much	1
less	1
finding	1
him.	1
The	1
man	1
laid	1
hold	1
of	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
arm,	1
saying,	1
“It	1
becomes	1
you	1
well	1
indeed,	1
Señor	1
Don	1
Luis,	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
dress	1
you	1
wear,	1
and	1
well	1
the	1
bed	1
in	1
which	1
I	1
find	1
you	1
agrees	1
with	1
the	1
luxury	1
in	1
which	1
your	1
mother	1
reared	1
you.”	1
The	1
youth	1
rubbed	1
his	1
sleepy	1
eyes	1
and	1
stared	1
for	1
a	1
while	1
at	1
him	1
who	1
held	1
him,	1
but	1
presently	1
recognised	1
him	1
as	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
father’s	1
servants,	1
at	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
so	1
taken	1
aback	1
that	1
for	1
some	1
time	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
find	1
or	1
utter	1
a	1
word;	1
while	1
the	1
servant	1
went	1
on	1
to	1
say,	1
“There	1
is	1
nothing	1
for	1
it	1
now,	1
Señor	1
Don	1
Luis,	1
but	1
to	1
submit	1
quietly	1
and	1
return	1
home,	1
unless	1
it	1
is	1
your	1
wish	1
that	1
my	1
lord,	1
your	1
father,	1
should	1
take	1
his	1
departure	1
for	1
the	1
other	1
world,	1
for	1
nothing	1
else	1
can	1
be	1
the	1
consequence	1
of	1
the	1
grief	1
he	1
is	1
in	1
at	1
your	1
absence.”	1
“But	1
how	1
did	1
my	1
father	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
had	1
gone	1
this	1
road	1
and	1
in	1
this	1
dress?”	1
said	1
Don	1
Luis.	1
“It	1
was	1
a	1
student	1
to	1
whom	1
you	1
confided	1
your	1
intentions,”	1
answered	1
the	1
servant,	1
“that	1
disclosed	1
them,	1
touched	1
with	1
pity	1
at	1
the	1
distress	1
he	1
saw	1
your	1
father	1
suffer	1
on	1
missing	1
you;	1
he	1
therefore	1
despatched	1
four	1
of	1
his	1
servants	1
in	1
quest	1
of	1
you,	1
and	1
here	1
we	1
all	1
are	1
at	1
your	1
service,	1
better	1
pleased	1
than	1
you	1
can	1
imagine	1
that	1
we	1
shall	1
return	1
so	1
soon	1
and	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
restore	1
you	1
to	1
those	1
eyes	1
that	1
so	1
yearn	1
for	1
you.”	1
“That	1
shall	1
be	1
as	1
I	1
please,	1
or	1
as	1
heaven	1
orders,”	1
returned	1
Don	1
Luis.	1
“What	1
can	1
you	1
please	1
or	1
heaven	1
order,”	1
said	1
the	1
other,	1
“except	1
to	1
agree	1
to	1
go	1
back?	1
Anything	1
else	1
is	1
impossible.”	1
All	1
this	1
conversation	1
between	1
the	1
two	1
was	1
overheard	1
by	1
the	1
muleteer	1
at	1
whose	1
side	1
Don	1
Luis	1
lay,	1
and	1
rising,	1
he	1
went	1
to	1
report	1
what	1
had	1
taken	1
place	1
to	1
Don	1
Fernando,	1
Cardenio,	1
and	1
the	1
others,	1
who	1
had	1
by	1
this	1
time	1
dressed	1
themselves;	1
and	1
told	1
them	1
how	1
the	1
man	1
had	1
addressed	1
the	1
youth	1
as	1
“Don,”	1
and	1
what	1
words	1
had	1
passed,	1
and	1
how	1
he	1
wanted	1
him	1
to	1
return	1
to	1
his	1
father,	1
which	1
the	1
youth	1
was	1
unwilling	1
to	1
do.	1
With	1
this,	1
and	1
what	1
they	1
already	1
knew	1
of	1
the	1
rare	1
voice	1
that	1
heaven	1
had	1
bestowed	1
upon	1
him,	1
they	1
all	1
felt	1
very	1
anxious	1
to	1
know	1
more	1
particularly	1
who	1
he	1
was,	1
and	1
even	1
to	1
help	1
him	1
if	1
it	1
was	1
attempted	1
to	1
employ	1
force	1
against	1
him;	1
so	1
they	1
hastened	1
to	1
where	1
he	1
was	1
still	1
talking	1
and	1
arguing	1
with	1
his	1
servant.	1
Dorothea	1
at	1
this	1
instant	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
her	1
room,	1
followed	1
by	1
Doña	1
Clara	1
all	1
in	1
a	1
tremor;	1
and	1
calling	1
Cardenio	1
aside,	1
she	1
told	1
him	1
in	1
a	1
few	1
words	1
the	1
story	1
of	1
the	1
musician	1
and	1
Doña	1
Clara,	1
and	1
he	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
told	1
her	1
what	1
had	1
happened,	1
how	1
his	1
father’s	1
servants	1
had	1
come	1
in	1
search	1
of	1
him;	1
but	1
in	1
telling	1
her	1
so,	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
speak	1
low	1
enough	1
but	1
that	1
Doña	1
Clara	1
heard	1
what	1
he	1
said,	1
at	1
which	1
she	1
was	1
so	1
much	1
agitated	1
that	1
had	1
not	1
Dorothea	1
hastened	1
to	1
support	1
her	1
she	1
would	1
have	1
fallen	1
to	1
the	1
ground.	1
Cardenio	1
then	1
bade	1
Dorothea	1
return	1
to	1
her	1
room,	1
as	1
he	1
would	1
endeavour	1
to	1
make	1
the	1
whole	1
matter	1
right,	1
and	1
they	1
did	1
as	1
he	1
desired.	1
All	1
the	1
four	1
who	1
had	1
come	1
in	1
quest	1
of	1
Don	1
Luis	1
had	1
now	1
come	1
into	1
the	1
inn	1
and	1
surrounded	1
him,	1
urging	1
him	1
to	1
return	1
and	1
console	1
his	1
father	1
at	1
once	1
and	1
without	1
a	1
moment’s	1
delay.	1
He	1
replied	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
do	1
so	1
on	1
any	1
account	1
until	1
he	1
had	1
concluded	1
some	1
business	1
in	1
which	1
his	1
life,	1
honour,	1
and	1
heart	1
were	1
at	1
stake.	1
The	1
servants	1
pressed	1
him,	1
saying	1
that	1
most	1
certainly	1
they	1
would	1
not	1
return	1
without	1
him,	1
and	1
that	1
they	1
would	1
take	1
him	1
away	1
whether	1
he	1
liked	1
it	1
or	1
not.	1
“You	1
shall	1
not	1
do	1
that,”	1
replied	1
Don	1
Luis,	1
“unless	1
you	1
take	1
me	1
dead;	1
though	1
however	1
you	1
take	1
me,	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
without	1
life.”	1
By	1
this	1
time	1
most	1
of	1
those	1
in	1
the	1
inn	1
had	1
been	1
attracted	1
by	1
the	1
dispute,	1
but	1
particularly	1
Cardenio,	1
Don	1
Fernando,	1
his	1
companions,	1
the	1
Judge,	1
the	1
curate,	1
the	1
barber,	1
and	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
for	1
he	1
now	1
considered	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
necessity	1
for	1
mounting	1
guard	1
over	1
the	1
castle	1
any	1
longer.	1
Cardenio	1
being	1
already	1
acquainted	1
with	1
the	1
young	1
man’s	1
story,	1
asked	1
the	1
men	1
who	1
wanted	1
to	1
take	1
him	1
away,	1
what	1
object	1
they	1
had	1
in	1
seeking	1
to	1
carry	1
off	1
this	1
youth	1
against	1
his	1
will.	1
“Our	1
object,”	1
said	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
four,	1
“is	1
to	1
save	1
the	1
life	1
of	1
his	1
father,	1
who	1
is	1
in	1
danger	1
of	1
losing	1
it	1
through	1
this	1
gentleman’s	1
disappearance.”	1
Upon	1
this	1
Don	1
Luis	1
exclaimed,	1
“There	1
is	1
no	1
need	1
to	1
make	1
my	1
affairs	1
public	1
here;	1
I	1
am	1
free,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
return	1
if	1
I	1
please;	1
and	1
if	1
not,	1
none	1
of	1
you	1
shall	1
compel	1
me.”	1
“Reason	1
will	1
compel	1
your	1
worship,”	1
said	1
the	1
man,	1
“and	1
if	1
it	1
has	1
no	1
power	1
over	1
you,	1
it	1
has	1
power	1
over	1
us,	1
to	1
make	1
us	1
do	1
what	1
we	1
came	1
for,	1
and	1
what	1
it	1
is	1
our	1
duty	1
to	1
do.”	1
“Let	1
us	1
hear	1
what	1
the	1
whole	1
affair	1
is	1
about,”	1
said	1
the	1
Judge	1
at	1
this;	1
but	1
the	1
man,	1
who	1
knew	1
him	1
as	1
a	1
neighbour	1
of	1
theirs,	1
replied,	1
“Do	1
you	1
not	1
know	1
this	1
gentleman,	1
Señor	1
Judge?	1
He	1
is	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
your	1
neighbour,	1
who	1
has	1
run	1
away	1
from	1
his	1
father’s	1
house	1
in	1
a	1
dress	1
so	1
unbecoming	1
his	1
rank,	1
as	1
your	1
worship	1
may	1
perceive.”	1
The	1
judge	1
on	1
this	1
looked	1
at	1
him	1
more	1
carefully	1
and	1
recognised	1
him,	1
and	1
embracing	1
him	1
said,	1
“What	1
folly	1
is	1
this,	1
Señor	1
Don	1
Luis,	1
or	1
what	1
can	1
have	1
been	1
the	1
cause	1
that	1
could	1
have	1
induced	1
you	1
to	1
come	1
here	1
in	1
this	1
way,	1
and	1
in	1
this	1
dress,	1
which	1
so	1
ill	1
becomes	1
your	1
condition?”	1
Tears	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
the	1
young	1
man,	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
unable	1
to	1
utter	1
a	1
word	1
in	1
reply	1
to	1
the	1
Judge,	1
who	1
told	1
the	1
four	1
servants	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
uneasy,	1
for	1
all	1
would	1
be	1
satisfactorily	1
settled;	1
and	1
then	1
taking	1
Don	1
Luis	1
by	1
the	1
hand,	1
he	1
drew	1
him	1
aside	1
and	1
asked	1
the	1
reason	1
of	1
his	1
having	1
come	1
there.	1
But	1
while	1
he	1
was	1
questioning	1
him	1
they	1
heard	1
a	1
loud	1
outcry	1
at	1
the	1
gate	1
of	1
the	1
inn,	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
which	1
was	1
that	1
two	1
of	1
the	1
guests	1
who	1
had	1
passed	1
the	1
night	1
there,	1
seeing	1
everybody	1
busy	1
about	1
finding	1
out	1
what	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
four	1
men	1
wanted,	1
had	1
conceived	1
the	1
idea	1
of	1
going	1
off	1
without	1
paying	1
what	1
they	1
owed;	1
but	1
the	1
landlord,	1
who	1
minded	1
his	1
own	1
affairs	1
more	1
than	1
other	1
people’s,	1
caught	1
them	1
going	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
gate	1
and	1
demanded	1
his	1
reckoning,	1
abusing	1
them	1
for	1
their	1
dishonesty	1
with	1
such	1
language	1
that	1
he	1
drove	1
them	1
to	1
reply	1
with	1
their	1
fists,	1
and	1
so	1
they	1
began	1
to	1
lay	1
on	1
him	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
style	1
that	1
the	1
poor	1
man	1
was	1
forced	1
to	1
cry	1
out,	1
and	1
call	1
for	1
help.	1
The	1
landlady	1
and	1
her	1
daughter	1
could	1
see	1
no	1
one	1
more	1
free	1
to	1
give	1
aid	1
than	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
and	1
to	1
him	1
the	1
daughter	1
said,	1
“Sir	1
knight,	1
by	1
the	1
virtue	1
God	1
has	1
given	1
you,	1
help	1
my	1
poor	1
father,	1
for	1
two	1
wicked	1
men	1
are	1
beating	1
him	1
to	1
a	1
mummy.”	1
To	1
which	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
very	1
deliberately	1
and	1
phlegmatically	1
replied,	1
“Fair	1
damsel,	1
at	1
the	1
present	1
moment	1
your	1
request	1
is	1
inopportune,	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
debarred	1
from	1
involving	1
myself	1
in	1
any	1
adventure	1
until	1
I	1
have	1
brought	1
to	1
a	1
happy	1
conclusion	1
one	1
to	1
which	1
my	1
word	1
has	1
pledged	1
me;	1
but	1
that	1
which	1
I	1
can	1
do	1
for	1
you	1
is	1
what	1
I	1
will	1
now	1
mention:	1
run	1
and	1
tell	1
your	1
father	1
to	1
stand	1
his	1
ground	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
he	1
can	1
in	1
this	1
battle,	1
and	1
on	1
no	1
account	1
to	1
allow	1
himself	1
to	1
be	1
vanquished,	1
while	1
I	1
go	1
and	1
request	1
permission	1
of	1
the	1
Princess	1
Micomicona	1
to	1
enable	1
me	1
to	1
succour	1
him	1
in	1
his	1
distress;	1
and	1
if	1
she	1
grants	1
it,	1
rest	1
assured	1
I	1
will	1
relieve	1
him	1
from	1
it.”	1
“Sinner	1
that	1
I	1
am,”	1
exclaimed	1
Maritornes,	1
who	1
stood	1
by;	1
“before	1
you	1
have	1
got	1
your	1
permission	1
my	1
master	1
will	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
other	1
world.”	1
“Give	1
me	1
leave,	1
señora,	1
to	1
obtain	1
the	1
permission	1
I	1
speak	1
of,”	1
returned	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
“and	1
if	1
I	1
get	1
it,	1
it	1
will	1
matter	1
very	1
little	1
if	1
he	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
other	1
world;	1
for	1
I	1
will	1
rescue	1
him	1
thence	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
same	1
world	1
can	1
do;	1
or	1
at	1
any	1
rate	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
you	1
such	1
a	1
revenge	1
over	1
those	1
who	1
shall	1
have	1
sent	1
him	1
there	1
that	1
you	1
will	1
be	1
more	1
than	1
moderately	1
satisfied;”	1
and	1
without	1
saying	1
anything	1
more	1
he	1
went	1
and	1
knelt	1
before	1
Dorothea,	1
requesting	1
her	1
Highness	1
in	1
knightly	1
and	1
errant	1
phrase	1
to	1
be	1
pleased	1
to	1
grant	1
him	1
permission	1
to	1
aid	1
and	1
succour	1
the	1
castellan	1
of	1
that	1
castle,	1
who	1
now	1
stood	1
in	1
grievous	1
jeopardy.	1
The	1
princess	1
granted	1
it	1
graciously,	1
and	1
he	1
at	1
once,	1
bracing	1
his	1
buckler	1
on	1
his	1
arm	1
and	1
drawing	1
his	1
sword,	1
hastened	1
to	1
the	1
inn-gate,	1
where	1
the	1
two	1
guests	1
were	1
still	1
handling	1
the	1
landlord	1
roughly;	1
but	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
reached	1
the	1
spot	1
he	1
stopped	1
short	1
and	1
stood	1
still,	1
though	1
Maritornes	1
and	1
the	1
landlady	1
asked	1
him	1
why	1
he	1
hesitated	1
to	1
help	1
their	1
master	1
and	1
husband.	1
“I	1
hesitate,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“because	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
lawful	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
draw	1
sword	1
against	1
persons	1
of	1
squirely	1
condition;	1
but	1
call	1
my	1
squire	1
Sancho	1
to	1
me;	1
for	1
this	1
defence	1
and	1
vengeance	1
are	1
his	1
affair	1
and	1
business.”	1
Thus	1
matters	1
stood	1
at	1
the	1
inn-gate,	1
where	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
very	1
lively	1
exchange	1
of	1
fisticuffs	1
and	1
punches,	1
to	1
the	1
sore	1
damage	1
of	1
the	1
landlord	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
wrath	1
of	1
Maritornes,	1
the	1
landlady,	1
and	1
her	1
daughter,	1
who	1
were	1
furious	1
when	1
they	1
saw	1
the	1
pusillanimity	1
of	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
and	1
the	1
hard	1
treatment	1
their	1
master,	1
husband	1
and	1
father	1
was	1
undergoing.	1
But	1
let	1
us	1
leave	1
him	1
there;	1
for	1
he	1
will	1
surely	1
find	1
someone	1
to	1
help	1
him,	1
and	1
if	1
not,	1
let	1
him	1
suffer	1
and	1
hold	1
his	1
tongue	1
who	1
attempts	1
more	1
than	1
his	1
strength	1
allows	1
him	1
to	1
do;	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
go	1
back	1
fifty	1
paces	1
to	1
see	1
what	1
Don	1
Luis	1
said	1
in	1
reply	1
to	1
the	1
Judge	1
whom	1
we	1
left	1
questioning	1
him	1
privately	1
as	1
to	1
his	1
reasons	1
for	1
coming	1
on	1
foot	1
and	1
so	1
meanly	1
dressed.	1
To	1
which	1
the	1
youth,	1
pressing	1
his	1
hand	1
in	1
a	1
way	1
that	1
showed	1
his	1
heart	1
was	1
troubled	1
by	1
some	1
great	1
sorrow,	1
and	1
shedding	1
a	1
flood	1
of	1
tears,	1
made	1
answer:	1
“Señor,	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
more	1
to	1
tell	1
you	1
than	1
that	1
from	1
the	1
moment	1
when,	1
through	1
heaven’s	1
will	1
and	1
our	1
being	1
near	1
neighbours,	1
I	1
first	1
saw	1
Doña	1
Clara,	1
your	1
daughter	1
and	1
my	1
lady,	1
from	1
that	1
instant	1
I	1
made	1
her	1
the	1
mistress	1
of	1
my	1
will,	1
and	1
if	1
yours,	1
my	1
true	1
lord	1
and	1
father,	1
offers	1
no	1
impediment,	1
this	1
very	1
day	1
she	1
shall	1
become	1
my	1
wife.	1
For	1
her	1
I	1
left	1
my	1
father’s	1
house,	1
and	1
for	1
her	1
I	1
assumed	1
this	1
disguise,	1
to	1
follow	1
her	1
whithersoever	1
she	1
may	1
go,	1
as	1
the	1
arrow	1
seeks	1
its	1
mark	1
or	1
the	1
sailor	1
the	1
pole-star.	1
She	1
knows	1
nothing	1
more	1
of	1
my	1
passion	1
than	1
what	1
she	1
may	1
have	1
learned	1
from	1
having	1
sometimes	1
seen	1
from	1
a	1
distance	1
that	1
my	1
eyes	1
were	1
filled	1
with	1
tears.	1
You	1
know	1
already,	1
señor,	1
the	1
wealth	1
and	1
noble	1
birth	1
of	1
my	1
parents,	1
and	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
their	1
sole	1
heir;	1
if	1
this	1
be	1
a	1
sufficient	1
inducement	1
for	1
you	1
to	1
venture	1
to	1
make	1
me	1
completely	1
happy,	1
accept	1
me	1
at	1
once	1
as	1
your	1
son;	1
for	1
if	1
my	1
father,	1
influenced	1
by	1
other	1
objects	1
of	1
his	1
own,	1
should	1
disapprove	1
of	1
this	1
happiness	1
I	1
have	1
sought	1
for	1
myself,	1
time	1
has	1
more	1
power	1
to	1
alter	1
and	1
change	1
things,	1
than	1
human	1
will.”	1
With	1
this	1
the	1
love-smitten	1
youth	1
was	1
silent,	1
while	1
the	1
Judge,	1
after	1
hearing	1
him,	1
was	1
astonished,	1
perplexed,	1
and	1
surprised,	1
as	1
well	1
at	1
the	1
manner	1
and	1
intelligence	1
with	1
which	1
Don	1
Luis	1
had	1
confessed	1
the	1
secret	1
of	1
his	1
heart,	1
as	1
at	1
the	1
position	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
found	1
himself,	1
not	1
knowing	1
what	1
course	1
to	1
take	1
in	1
a	1
matter	1
so	1
sudden	1
and	1
unexpected.	1
All	1
the	1
answer,	1
therefore,	1
he	1
gave	1
him	1
was	1
to	1
bid	1
him	1
to	1
make	1
his	1
mind	1
easy	1
for	1
the	1
present,	1
and	1
arrange	1
with	1
his	1
servants	1
not	1
to	1
take	1
him	1
back	1
that	1
day,	1
so	1
that	1
there	1
might	1
be	1
time	1
to	1
consider	1
what	1
was	1
best	1
for	1
all	1
parties.	1
Don	1
Luis	1
kissed	1
his	1
hands	1
by	1
force,	1
nay,	1
bathed	1
them	1
with	1
his	1
tears,	1
in	1
a	1
way	1
that	1
would	1
have	1
touched	1
a	1
heart	1
of	1
marble,	1
not	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
Judge,	1
who,	1
as	1
a	1
shrewd	1
man,	1
had	1
already	1
perceived	1
how	1
advantageous	1
the	1
marriage	1
would	1
be	1
to	1
his	1
daughter;	1
though,	1
were	1
it	1
possible,	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
preferred	1
that	1
it	1
should	1
be	1
brought	1
about	1
with	1
the	1
consent	1
of	1
the	1
father	1
of	1
Don	1
Luis,	1
who	1
he	1
knew	1
looked	1
for	1
a	1
title	1
for	1
his	1
son.	1
The	1
guests	1
had	1
by	1
this	1
time	1
made	1
peace	1
with	1
the	1
landlord,	1
for,	1
by	1
persuasion	1
and	1
Don	1
Quixote’s	1
fair	1
words	1
more	1
than	1
by	1
threats,	1
they	1
had	1
paid	1
him	1
what	1
he	1
demanded,	1
and	1
the	1
servants	1
of	1
Don	1
Luis	1
were	1
waiting	1
for	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
conversation	1
with	1
the	1
Judge	1
and	1
their	1
master’s	1
decision,	1
when	1
the	1
devil,	1
who	1
never	1
sleeps,	1
contrived	1
that	1
the	1
barber,	1
from	1
whom	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
had	1
taken	1
Mambrino’s	1
helmet,	1
and	1
Sancho	1
Panza	1
the	1
trappings	1
of	1
his	1
ass	1
in	1
exchange	1
for	1
those	1
of	1
his	1
own,	1
should	1
at	1
this	1
instant	1
enter	1
the	1
inn;	1
which	1
said	1
barber,	1
as	1
he	1
led	1
his	1
ass	1
to	1
the	1
stable,	1
observed	1
Sancho	1
Panza	1
engaged	1
in	1
repairing	1
something	1
or	1
other	1
belonging	1
to	1
the	1
pack-saddle;	1
and	1
the	1
moment	1
he	1
saw	1
it	1
he	1
knew	1
it,	1
and	1
made	1
bold	1
to	1
attack	1
Sancho,	1
exclaiming,	1
“Ho,	1
sir	1
thief,	1
I	1
have	1
caught	1
you!	1
hand	1
over	1
my	1
basin	1
and	1
my	1
pack-saddle,	1
and	1
all	1
my	1
trappings	1
that	1
you	1
robbed	1
me	1
of.”	1
Sancho,	1
finding	1
himself	1
so	1
unexpectedly	1
assailed,	1
and	1
hearing	1
the	1
abuse	1
poured	1
upon	1
him,	1
seized	1
the	1
pack-saddle	1
with	1
one	1
hand,	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
other	1
gave	1
the	1
barber	1
a	1
cuff	1
that	1
bathed	1
his	1
teeth	1
in	1
blood.	1
The	1
barber,	1
however,	1
was	1
not	1
so	1
ready	1
to	1
relinquish	1
the	1
prize	1
he	1
had	1
made	1
in	1
the	1
pack-saddle;	1
on	1
the	1
contrary,	1
he	1
raised	1
such	1
an	1
outcry	1
that	1
everyone	1
in	1
the	1
inn	1
came	1
running	1
to	1
know	1
what	1
the	1
noise	1
and	1
quarrel	1
meant.	1
“Here,	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
king	1
and	1
justice!”	1
he	1
cried,	1
“this	1
thief	1
and	1
highwayman	1
wants	1
to	1
kill	1
me	1
for	1
trying	1
to	1
recover	1
my	1
property.”	1
“You	1
lie,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“I	1
am	1
no	1
highwayman;	1
it	1
was	1
in	1
fair	1
war	1
my	1
master	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
won	1
these	1
spoils.”	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
was	1
standing	1
by	1
at	1
the	1
time,	1
highly	1
pleased	1
to	1
see	1
his	1
squire’s	1
stoutness,	1
both	1
offensive	1
and	1
defensive,	1
and	1
from	1
that	1
time	1
forth	1
he	1
reckoned	1
him	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
mettle,	1
and	1
in	1
his	1
heart	1
resolved	1
to	1
dub	1
him	1
a	1
knight	1
on	1
the	1
first	1
opportunity	1
that	1
presented	1
itself,	1
feeling	1
sure	1
that	1
the	1
order	1
of	1
chivalry	1
would	1
be	1
fittingly	1
bestowed	1
upon	1
him.	1
In	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
the	1
altercation,	1
among	1
other	1
things	1
the	1
barber	1
said,	1
“Gentlemen,	1
this	1
pack-saddle	1
is	1
mine	1
as	1
surely	1
as	1
I	1
owe	1
God	1
a	1
death,	1
and	1
I	1
know	1
it	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
if	1
I	1
had	1
given	1
birth	1
to	1
it,	1
and	1
here	1
is	1
my	1
ass	1
in	1
the	1
stable	1
who	1
will	1
not	1
let	1
me	1
lie;	1
only	1
try	1
it,	1
and	1
if	1
it	1
does	1
not	1
fit	1
him	1
like	1
a	1
glove,	1
call	1
me	1
a	1
rascal;	1
and	1
what	1
is	1
more,	1
the	1
same	1
day	1
I	1
was	1
robbed	1
of	1
this,	1
they	1
robbed	1
me	1
likewise	1
of	1
a	1
new	1
brass	1
basin,	1
never	1
yet	1
handselled,	1
that	1
would	1
fetch	1
a	1
crown	1
any	1
day.”	1
At	1
this	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
could	1
not	1
keep	1
himself	1
from	1
answering;	1
and	1
interposing	1
between	1
the	1
two,	1
and	1
separating	1
them,	1
he	1
placed	1
the	1
pack-saddle	1
on	1
the	1
ground,	1
to	1
lie	1
there	1
in	1
sight	1
until	1
the	1
truth	1
was	1
established,	1
and	1
said,	1
“Your	1
worships	1
may	1
perceive	1
clearly	1
and	1
plainly	1
the	1
error	1
under	1
which	1
this	1
worthy	1
squire	1
lies	1
when	1
he	1
calls	1
a	1
basin	1
which	1
was,	1
is,	1
and	1
shall	1
be	1
the	1
helmet	1
of	1
Mambrino	1
which	1
I	1
won	1
from	1
him	1
in	1
fair	1
war,	1
and	1
made	1
myself	1
master	1
of	1
by	1
legitimate	1
and	1
lawful	1
possession.	1
With	1
the	1
pack-saddle	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
concern	1
myself;	1
but	1
I	1
may	1
tell	1
you	1
on	1
that	1
head	1
that	1
my	1
squire	1
Sancho	1
asked	1
my	1
permission	1
to	1
strip	1
off	1
the	1
caparison	1
of	1
this	1
vanquished	1
poltroon’s	1
steed,	1
and	1
with	1
it	1
adorn	1
his	1
own;	1
I	1
allowed	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
took	1
it;	1
and	1
as	1
to	1
its	1
having	1
been	1
changed	1
from	1
a	1
caparison	1
into	1
a	1
pack-saddle,	1
I	1
can	1
give	1
no	1
explanation	1
except	1
the	1
usual	1
one,	1
that	1
such	1
transformations	1
will	1
take	1
place	1
in	1
adventures	1
of	1
chivalry.	1
To	1
confirm	1
all	1
which,	1
run,	1
Sancho	1
my	1
son,	1
and	1
fetch	1
hither	1
the	1
helmet	1
which	1
this	1
good	1
fellow	1
calls	1
a	1
basin.”	1
“Egad,	1
master,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“if	1
we	1
have	1
no	1
other	1
proof	1
of	1
our	1
case	1
than	1
what	1
your	1
worship	1
puts	1
forward,	1
Mambrino’s	1
helmet	1
is	1
just	1
as	1
much	1
a	1
basin	1
as	1
this	1
good	1
fellow’s	1
caparison	1
is	1
a	1
pack-saddle.”	1
“Do	1
as	1
I	1
bid	1
thee,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
“it	1
cannot	1
be	1
that	1
everything	1
in	1
this	1
castle	1
goes	1
by	1
enchantment.”	1
Sancho	1
hastened	1
to	1
where	1
the	1
basin	1
was,	1
and	1
brought	1
it	1
back	1
with	1
him,	1
and	1
when	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
saw	1
it,	1
he	1
took	1
hold	1
of	1
it	1
and	1
said:	1
“Your	1
worships	1
may	1
see	1
with	1
what	1
a	1
face	1
this	1
squire	1
can	1
assert	1
that	1
this	1
is	1
a	1
basin	1
and	1
not	1
the	1
helmet	1
I	1
told	1
you	1
of;	1
and	1
I	1
swear	1
by	1
the	1
order	1
of	1
chivalry	1
I	1
profess,	1
that	1
this	1
helmet	1
is	1
the	1
identical	1
one	1
I	1
took	1
from	1
him,	1
without	1
anything	1
added	1
to	1
or	1
taken	1
from	1
it.”	1
“There	1
is	1
no	1
doubt	1
of	1
that,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“for	1
from	1
the	1
time	1
my	1
master	1
won	1
it	1
until	1
now	1
he	1
has	1
only	1
fought	1
one	1
battle	1
in	1
it,	1
when	1
he	1
let	1
loose	1
those	1
unlucky	1
men	1
in	1
chains;	1
and	1
if	1
it	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
for	1
this	1
basin-helmet	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
come	1
off	1
over	1
well	1
that	1
time,	1
for	1
there	1
was	1
plenty	1
of	1
stone-throwing	1
in	1
that	1
affair.”	1

“What	1
do	1
you	1
think	1
now,	1
gentlemen,”	1
said	1
the	1
barber,	1
“of	1
what	1
these	1
gentles	1
say,	1
when	1
they	1
want	1
to	1
make	1
out	1
that	1
this	1
is	1
a	1
helmet?”	1
“And	1
whoever	1
says	1
the	1
contrary,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“I	1
will	1
let	1
him	1
know	1
he	1
lies	1
if	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
knight,	1
and	1
if	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
squire	1
that	1
he	1
lies	1
again	1
a	1
thousand	1
times.”	1
Our	1
own	1
barber,	1
who	1
was	1
present	1
at	1
all	1
this,	1
and	1
understood	1
Don	1
Quixote’s	1
humour	1
so	1
thoroughly,	1
took	1
it	1
into	1
his	1
head	1
to	1
back	1
up	1
his	1
delusion	1
and	1
carry	1
on	1
the	1
joke	1
for	1
the	1
general	1
amusement;	1
so	1
addressing	1
the	1
other	1
barber	1
he	1
said:	1
“Señor	1
barber,	1
or	1
whatever	1
you	1
are,	1
you	1
must	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
belong	1
to	1
your	1
profession	1
too,	1
and	1
have	1
had	1
a	1
licence	1
to	1
practise	1
for	1
more	1
than	1
twenty	1
years,	1
and	1
I	1
know	1
the	1
implements	1
of	1
the	1
barber	1
craft,	1
every	1
one	1
of	1
them,	1
perfectly	1
well;	1
and	1
I	1
was	1
likewise	1
a	1
soldier	1
for	1
some	1
time	1
in	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
my	1
youth,	1
and	1
I	1
know	1
also	1
what	1
a	1
helmet	1
is,	1
and	1
a	1
morion,	1
and	1
a	1
headpiece	1
with	1
a	1
visor,	1
and	1
other	1
things	1
pertaining	1
to	1
soldiering,	1
I	1
meant	1
to	1
say	1
to	1
soldiers’	1
arms;	1
and	1
I	1
say—saving	1
better	1
opinions	1
and	1
always	1
with	1
submission	1
to	1
sounder	1
judgments—that	1
this	1
piece	1
we	1
have	1
now	1
before	1
us,	1
which	1
this	1
worthy	1
gentleman	1
has	1
in	1
his	1
hands,	1
not	1
only	1
is	1
no	1
barber’s	1
basin,	1
but	1
is	1
as	1
far	1
from	1
being	1
one	1
as	1
white	1
is	1
from	1
black,	1
and	1
truth	1
from	1
falsehood;	1
I	1
say,	1
moreover,	1
that	1
this,	1
although	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
helmet,	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
complete	1
helmet.”	1
“Certainly	1
not,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“for	1
half	1
of	1
it	1
is	1
wanting,	1
that	1
is	1
to	1
say	1
the	1
beaver.”	1
“It	1
is	1
quite	1
true,”	1
said	1
the	1
curate,	1
who	1
saw	1
the	1
object	1
of	1
his	1
friend	1
the	1
barber;	1
and	1
Cardenio,	1
Don	1
Fernando	1
and	1
his	1
companions	1
agreed	1
with	1
him,	1
and	1
even	1
the	1
Judge,	1
if	1
his	1
thoughts	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
so	1
full	1
of	1
Don	1
Luis’s	1
affair,	1
would	1
have	1
helped	1
to	1
carry	1
on	1
the	1
joke;	1
but	1
he	1
was	1
so	1
taken	1
up	1
with	1
the	1
serious	1
matters	1
he	1
had	1
on	1
his	1
mind	1
that	1
he	1
paid	1
little	1
or	1
no	1
attention	1
to	1
these	1
facetious	1
proceedings.	1
“God	1
bless	1
me!”	1
exclaimed	1
their	1
butt	1
the	1
barber	1
at	1
this;	1
“is	1
it	1
possible	1
that	1
such	1
an	1
honourable	1
company	1
can	1
say	1
that	1
this	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
basin	1
but	1
a	1
helmet?	1
Why,	1
this	1
is	1
a	1
thing	1
that	1
would	1
astonish	1
a	1
whole	1
university,	1
however	1
wise	1
it	1
might	1
be!	1
That	1
will	1
do;	1
if	1
this	1
basin	1
is	1
a	1
helmet,	1
why,	1
then	1
the	1
pack-saddle	1
must	1
be	1
a	1
horse’s	1
caparison,	1
as	1
this	1
gentleman	1
has	1
said.”	1
“To	1
me	1
it	1
looks	1
like	1
a	1
pack-saddle,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
“but	1
I	1
have	1
already	1
said	1
that	1
with	1
that	1
question	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
concern	1
myself.”	1
“As	1
to	1
whether	1
it	1
be	1
pack-saddle	1
or	1
caparison,”	1
said	1
the	1
curate,	1
“it	1
is	1
only	1
for	1
Señor	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
to	1
say;	1
for	1
in	1
these	1
matters	1
of	1
chivalry	1
all	1
these	1
gentlemen	1
and	1
I	1
bow	1
to	1
his	1
authority.”	1
“By	1
God,	1
gentlemen,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“so	1
many	1
strange	1
things	1
have	1
happened	1
to	1
me	1
in	1
this	1
castle	1
on	1
the	1
two	1
occasions	1
on	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
sojourned	1
in	1
it,	1
that	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
venture	1
to	1
assert	1
anything	1
positively	1
in	1
reply	1
to	1
any	1
question	1
touching	1
anything	1
it	1
contains;	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
my	1
belief	1
that	1
everything	1
that	1
goes	1
on	1
within	1
it	1
goes	1
by	1
enchantment.	1
The	1
first	1
time,	1
an	1
enchanted	1
Moor	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
in	1
it	1
gave	1
me	1
sore	1
trouble,	1
nor	1
did	1
Sancho	1
fare	1
well	1
among	1
certain	1
followers	1
of	1
his;	1
and	1
last	1
night	1
I	1
was	1
kept	1
hanging	1
by	1
this	1
arm	1
for	1
nearly	1
two	1
hours,	1
without	1
knowing	1
how	1
or	1
why	1
I	1
came	1
by	1
such	1
a	1
mishap.	1
So	1
that	1
now,	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
come	1
forward	1
to	1
give	1
an	1
opinion	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
puzzling	1
matter,	1
would	1
be	1
to	1
risk	1
a	1
rash	1
decision.	1
As	1
regards	1
the	1
assertion	1
that	1
this	1
is	1
a	1
basin	1
and	1
not	1
a	1
helmet	1
I	1
have	1
already	1
given	1
an	1
answer;	1
but	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
question	1
whether	1
this	1
is	1
a	1
pack-saddle	1
or	1
a	1
caparison	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
venture	1
to	1
give	1
a	1
positive	1
opinion,	1
but	1
will	1
leave	1
it	1
to	1
your	1
worships’	1
better	1
judgment.	1
Perhaps	1
as	1
you	1
are	1
not	1
dubbed	1
knights	1
like	1
myself,	1
the	1
enchantments	1
of	1
this	1
place	1
have	1
nothing	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
you,	1
and	1
your	1
faculties	1
are	1
unfettered,	1
and	1
you	1
can	1
see	1
things	1
in	1
this	1
castle	1
as	1
they	1
really	1
and	1
truly	1
are,	1
and	1
not	1
as	1
they	1
appear	1
to	1
me.”	1
“There	1
can	1
be	1
no	1
question,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Fernando	1
on	1
this,	1
“but	1
that	1
Señor	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
has	1
spoken	1
very	1
wisely,	1
and	1
that	1
with	1
us	1
rests	1
the	1
decision	1
of	1
this	1
matter;	1
and	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
have	1
surer	1
ground	1
to	1
go	1
on,	1
I	1
will	1
take	1
the	1
votes	1
of	1
the	1
gentlemen	1
in	1
secret,	1
and	1
declare	1
the	1
result	1
clearly	1
and	1
fully.”	1
To	1
those	1
who	1
were	1
in	1
on	1
the	1
secret	1
of	1
Don	1
Quixote’s	1
humour	1
all	1
this	1
afforded	1
great	1
amusement;	1
but	1
to	1
those	1
who	1
knew	1
nothing	1
about	1
it,	1
it	1
seemed	1
the	1
greatest	1
nonsense	1
in	1
the	1
world,	1
in	1
particular	1
to	1
the	1
four	1
servants	1
of	1
Don	1
Luis,	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
to	1
Don	1
Luis	1
himself,	1
and	1
to	1
three	1
other	1
travellers	1
who	1
had	1
by	1
chance	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
inn,	1
and	1
had	1
the	1
appearance	1
of	1
officers	1
of	1
the	1
Holy	1
Brotherhood,	1
as	1
indeed	1
they	1
were;	1
but	1
the	1
one	1
who	1
above	1
all	1
was	1
at	1
his	1
wits’	1
end	1
was	1
the	1
barber	1
whose	1
basin,	1
there	1
before	1
his	1
very	1
eyes,	1
had	1
been	1
turned	1
into	1
Mambrino’s	1
helmet,	1
and	1
whose	1
pack-saddle	1
he	1
had	1
no	1
doubt	1
whatever	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
become	1
a	1
rich	1
caparison	1
for	1
a	1
horse.	1
All	1
laughed	1
to	1
see	1
Don	1
Fernando	1
going	1
from	1
one	1
to	1
another	1
collecting	1
the	1
votes,	1
and	1
whispering	1
to	1
them	1
to	1
give	1
him	1
their	1
private	1
opinion	1
whether	1
the	1
treasure	1
over	1
which	1
there	1
had	1
been	1
so	1
much	1
fighting	1
was	1
a	1
pack-saddle	1
or	1
a	1
caparison;	1
but	1
after	1
he	1
had	1
taken	1
the	1
votes	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
knew	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
he	1
said	1
aloud,	1
“The	1
fact	1
is,	1
my	1
good	1
fellow,	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
tired	1
collecting	1
such	1
a	1
number	1
of	1
opinions,	1
for	1
I	1
find	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
not	1
one	1
of	1
whom	1
I	1
ask	1
what	1
I	1
desire	1
to	1
know,	1
who	1
does	1
not	1
tell	1
me	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
absurd	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
pack-saddle	1
of	1
an	1
ass,	1
and	1
not	1
the	1
caparison	1
of	1
a	1
horse,	1
nay,	1
of	1
a	1
thoroughbred	1
horse;	1
so	1
you	1
must	1
submit,	1
for,	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
you	1
and	1
your	1
ass,	1
this	1
is	1
a	1
caparison	1
and	1
no	1
pack-saddle,	1
and	1
you	1
have	1
stated	1
and	1
proved	1
your	1
case	1
very	1
badly.”	1
“May	1
I	1
never	1
share	1
heaven,”	1
said	1
the	1
poor	1
barber,	1
“if	1
your	1
worships	1
are	1
not	1
all	1
mistaken;	1
and	1
may	1
my	1
soul	1
appear	1
before	1
God	1
as	1
that	1
appears	1
to	1
me	1
a	1
pack-saddle	1
and	1
not	1
a	1
caparison;	1
but,	1
‘laws	1
go,’—I	1
say	1
no	1
more;	1
and	1
indeed	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
drunk,	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
fasting,	1
except	1
it	1
be	1
from	1
sin.”	1
The	1
simple	1
talk	1
of	1
the	1
barber	1
did	1
not	1
afford	1
less	1
amusement	1
than	1
the	1
absurdities	1
of	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
who	1
now	1
observed:	1
“There	1
is	1
no	1
more	1
to	1
be	1
done	1
now	1
than	1
for	1
each	1
to	1
take	1
what	1
belongs	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
to	1
whom	1
God	1
has	1
given	1
it,	1
may	1
St.	1
Peter	1
add	1
his	1
blessing.”	1
But	1
said	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
four	1
servants,	1
“Unless,	1
indeed,	1
this	1
is	1
a	1
deliberate	1
joke,	1
I	1
cannot	1
bring	1
myself	1
to	1
believe	1
that	1
men	1
so	1
intelligent	1
as	1
those	1
present	1
are,	1
or	1
seem	1
to	1
be,	1
can	1
venture	1
to	1
declare	1
and	1
assert	1
that	1
this	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
basin,	1
and	1
that	1
not	1
a	1
pack-saddle;	1
but	1
as	1
I	1
perceive	1
that	1
they	1
do	1
assert	1
and	1
declare	1
it,	1
I	1
can	1
only	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
conclusion	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
some	1
mystery	1
in	1
this	1
persistence	1
in	1
what	1
is	1
so	1
opposed	1
to	1
the	1
evidence	1
of	1
experience	1
and	1
truth	1
itself;	1
for	1
I	1
swear	1
by”—and	1
here	1
he	1
rapped	1
out	1
a	1
round	1
oath—“all	1
the	1
people	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
will	1
not	1
make	1
me	1
believe	1
that	1
this	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
barber’s	1
basin	1
and	1
that	1
a	1
jackass’s	1
pack-saddle.”	1
“It	1
might	1
easily	1
be	1
a	1
she-ass’s,”	1
observed	1
the	1
curate.	1
“It	1
is	1
all	1
the	1
same,”	1
said	1
the	1
servant;	1
“that	1
is	1
not	1
the	1
point;	1
but	1
whether	1
it	1
is	1
or	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
pack-saddle,	1
as	1
your	1
worships	1
say.”	1
On	1
hearing	1
this	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
newly	1
arrived	1
officers	1
of	1
the	1
Brotherhood,	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
listening	1
to	1
the	1
dispute	1
and	1
controversy,	1
unable	1
to	1
restrain	1
his	1
anger	1
and	1
impatience,	1
exclaimed,	1
“It	1
is	1
a	1
pack-saddle	1
as	1
sure	1
as	1
my	1
father	1
is	1
my	1
father,	1
and	1
whoever	1
has	1
said	1
or	1
will	1
say	1
anything	1
else	1
must	1
be	1
drunk.”	1
“You	1
lie	1
like	1
a	1
rascally	1
clown,”	1
returned	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
and	1
lifting	1
his	1
pike,	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
never	1
let	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
hand,	1
he	1
delivered	1
such	1
a	1
blow	1
at	1
his	1
head	1
that,	1
had	1
not	1
the	1
officer	1
dodged	1
it,	1
it	1
would	1
have	1
stretched	1
him	1
at	1
full	1
length.	1
The	1
pike	1
was	1
shivered	1
in	1
pieces	1
against	1
the	1
ground,	1
and	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
officers,	1
seeing	1
their	1
comrade	1
assaulted,	1
raised	1
a	1
shout,	1
calling	1
for	1
help	1
for	1
the	1
Holy	1
Brotherhood.	1
The	1
landlord,	1
who	1
was	1
of	1
the	1
fraternity,	1
ran	1
at	1
once	1
to	1
fetch	1
his	1
staff	1
of	1
office	1
and	1
his	1
sword,	1
and	1
ranged	1
himself	1
on	1
the	1
side	1
of	1
his	1
comrades;	1
the	1
servants	1
of	1
Don	1
Luis	1
clustered	1
round	1
him,	1
lest	1
he	1
should	1
escape	1
from	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
confusion;	1
the	1
barber,	1
seeing	1
the	1
house	1
turned	1
upside	1
down,	1
once	1
more	1
laid	1
hold	1
of	1
his	1
pack-saddle	1
and	1
Sancho	1
did	1
the	1
same;	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
drew	1
his	1
sword	1
and	1
charged	1
the	1
officers;	1
Don	1
Luis	1
cried	1
out	1
to	1
his	1
servants	1
to	1
leave	1
him	1
alone	1
and	1
go	1
and	1
help	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
and	1
Cardenio	1
and	1
Don	1
Fernando,	1
who	1
were	1
supporting	1
him;	1
the	1
curate	1
was	1
shouting	1
at	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
his	1
voice,	1
the	1
landlady	1
was	1
screaming,	1
her	1
daughter	1
was	1
wailing,	1
Maritornes	1
was	1
weeping,	1
Dorothea	1
was	1
aghast,	1
Luscinda	1
terror-stricken,	1
and	1
Doña	1
Clara	1
in	1
a	1
faint.	1
The	1
barber	1
cudgelled	1
Sancho,	1
and	1
Sancho	1
pommelled	1
the	1
barber;	1
Don	1
Luis	1
gave	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
servants,	1
who	1
ventured	1
to	1
catch	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
arm	1
to	1
keep	1
him	1
from	1
escaping,	1
a	1
cuff	1
that	1
bathed	1
his	1
teeth	1
in	1
blood;	1
the	1
Judge	1
took	1
his	1
part;	1
Don	1
Fernando	1
had	1
got	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
officers	1
down	1
and	1
was	1
belabouring	1
him	1
heartily;	1
the	1
landlord	1
raised	1
his	1
voice	1
again	1
calling	1
for	1
help	1
for	1
the	1
Holy	1
Brotherhood;	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
whole	1
inn	1
was	1
nothing	1
but	1
cries,	1
shouts,	1
shrieks,	1
confusion,	1
terror,	1
dismay,	1
mishaps,	1
sword-cuts,	1
fisticuffs,	1
cudgellings,	1
kicks,	1
and	1
bloodshed;	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
all	1
this	1
chaos,	1
complication,	1
and	1
general	1
entanglement,	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
took	1
it	1
into	1
his	1
head	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
plunged	1
into	1
the	1
thick	1
of	1
the	1
discord	1
of	1
Agramante’s	1
camp;	1
and,	1
in	1
a	1
voice	1
that	1
shook	1
the	1
inn	1
like	1
thunder,	1
he	1
cried	1
out:	1
“Hold	1
all,	1
let	1
all	1
sheathe	1
their	1
swords,	1
let	1
all	1
be	1
calm	1
and	1
attend	1
to	1
me	1
as	1
they	1
value	1
their	1
lives!”	1
All	1
paused	1
at	1
his	1
mighty	1
voice,	1
and	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
to	1
say,	1
“Did	1
I	1
not	1
tell	1
you,	1
sirs,	1
that	1
this	1
castle	1
was	1
enchanted,	1
and	1
that	1
a	1
legion	1
or	1
so	1
of	1
devils	1
dwelt	1
in	1
it?	1
In	1
proof	1
whereof	1
I	1
call	1
upon	1
you	1
to	1
behold	1
with	1
your	1
own	1
eyes	1
how	1
the	1
discord	1
of	1
Agramante’s	1
camp	1
has	1
come	1
hither,	1
and	1
been	1
transferred	1
into	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
us.	1
See	1
how	1
they	1
fight,	1
there	1
for	1
the	1
sword,	1
here	1
for	1
the	1
horse,	1
on	1
that	1
side	1
for	1
the	1
eagle,	1
on	1
this	1
for	1
the	1
helmet;	1
we	1
are	1
all	1
fighting,	1
and	1
all	1
at	1
cross	1
purposes.	1
Come	1
then,	1
you,	1
Señor	1
Judge,	1
and	1
you,	1
señor	1
curate;	1
let	1
the	1
one	1
represent	1
King	1
Agramante	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
King	1
Sobrino,	1
and	1
make	1
peace	1
among	1
us;	1
for	1
by	1
God	1
Almighty	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
sorry	1
business	1
that	1
so	1
many	1
persons	1
of	1
quality	1
as	1
we	1
are	1
should	1
slay	1
one	1
another	1
for	1
such	1
trifling	1
cause.”	1
The	1
officers,	1
who	1
did	1
not	1
understand	1
Don	1
Quixote’s	1
mode	1
of	1
speaking,	1
and	1
found	1
themselves	1
roughly	1
handled	1
by	1
Don	1
Fernando,	1
Cardenio,	1
and	1
their	1
companions,	1
were	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
appeased;	1
the	1
barber	1
was,	1
however,	1
for	1
both	1
his	1
beard	1
and	1
his	1
pack-saddle	1
were	1
the	1
worse	1
for	1
the	1
struggle;	1
Sancho	1
like	1
a	1
good	1
servant	1
obeyed	1
the	1
slightest	1
word	1
of	1
his	1
master;	1
while	1
the	1
four	1
servants	1
of	1
Don	1
Luis	1
kept	1
quiet	1
when	1
they	1
saw	1
how	1
little	1
they	1
gained	1
by	1
not	1
being	1
so.	1
The	1
landlord	1
alone	1
insisted	1
upon	1
it	1
that	1
they	1
must	1
punish	1
the	1
insolence	1
of	1
this	1
madman,	1
who	1
at	1
every	1
turn	1
raised	1
a	1
disturbance	1
in	1
the	1
inn;	1
but	1
at	1
length	1
the	1
uproar	1
was	1
stilled	1
for	1
the	1
present;	1
the	1
pack-saddle	1
remained	1
a	1
caparison	1
till	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
judgment,	1
and	1
the	1
basin	1
a	1
helmet	1
and	1
the	1
inn	1
a	1
castle	1
in	1
Don	1
Quixote’s	1
imagination.	1
All	1
having	1
been	1
now	1
pacified	1
and	1
made	1
friends	1
by	1
the	1
persuasion	1
of	1
the	1
Judge	1
and	1
the	1
curate,	1
the	1
servants	1
of	1
Don	1
Luis	1
began	1
again	1
to	1
urge	1
him	1
to	1
return	1
with	1
them	1
at	1
once;	1
and	1
while	1
he	1
was	1
discussing	1
the	1
matter	1
with	1
them,	1
the	1
Judge	1
took	1
counsel	1
with	1
Don	1
Fernando,	1
Cardenio,	1
and	1
the	1
curate	1
as	1
to	1
what	1
he	1
ought	1
to	1
do	1
in	1
the	1
case,	1
telling	1
them	1
how	1
it	1
stood,	1
and	1
what	1
Don	1
Luis	1
had	1
said	1
to	1
him.	1
It	1
was	1
agreed	1
at	1
length	1
that	1
Don	1
Fernando	1
should	1
tell	1
the	1
servants	1
of	1
Don	1
Luis	1
who	1
he	1
was,	1
and	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
his	1
desire	1
that	1
Don	1
Luis	1
should	1
accompany	1
him	1
to	1
Andalusia,	1
where	1
he	1
would	1
receive	1
from	1
the	1
marquis	1
his	1
brother	1
the	1
welcome	1
his	1
quality	1
entitled	1
him	1
to;	1
for,	1
otherwise,	1
it	1
was	1
easy	1
to	1
see	1
from	1
the	1
determination	1
of	1
Don	1
Luis	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
return	1
to	1
his	1
father	1
at	1
present,	1
though	1
they	1
tore	1
him	1
to	1
pieces.	1
On	1
learning	1
the	1
rank	1
of	1
Don	1
Fernando	1
and	1
the	1
resolution	1
of	1
Don	1
Luis	1
the	1
four	1
then	1
settled	1
it	1
between	1
themselves	1
that	1
three	1
of	1
them	1
should	1
return	1
to	1
tell	1
his	1
father	1
how	1
matters	1
stood,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
other	1
should	1
remain	1
to	1
wait	1
upon	1
Don	1
Luis,	1
and	1
not	1
leave	1
him	1
until	1
they	1
came	1
back	1
for	1
him,	1
or	1
his	1
father’s	1
orders	1
were	1
known.	1
Thus	1
by	1
the	1
authority	1
of	1
Agramante	1
and	1
the	1
wisdom	1
of	1
King	1
Sobrino	1
all	1
this	1
complication	1
of	1
disputes	1
was	1
arranged;	1
but	1
the	1
enemy	1
of	1
concord	1
and	1
hater	1
of	1
peace,	1
feeling	1
himself	1
slighted	1
and	1
made	1
a	1
fool	1
of,	1
and	1
seeing	1
how	1
little	1
he	1
had	1
gained	1
after	1
having	1
involved	1
them	1
all	1
in	1
such	1
an	1
elaborate	1
entanglement,	1
resolved	1
to	1
try	1
his	1
hand	1
once	1
more	1
by	1
stirring	1
up	1
fresh	1
quarrels	1
and	1
disturbances.	1
It	1
came	1
about	1
in	1
this	1
wise:	1
the	1
officers	1
were	1
pacified	1
on	1
learning	1
the	1
rank	1
of	1
those	1
with	1
whom	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
engaged,	1
and	1
withdrew	1
from	1
the	1
contest,	1
considering	1
that	1
whatever	1
the	1
result	1
might	1
be	1
they	1
were	1
likely	1
to	1
get	1
the	1
worst	1
of	1
the	1
battle;	1
but	1
one	1
of	1
them,	1
the	1
one	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
thrashed	1
and	1
kicked	1
by	1
Don	1
Fernando,	1
recollected	1
that	1
among	1
some	1
warrants	1
he	1
carried	1
for	1
the	1
arrest	1
of	1
certain	1
delinquents,	1
he	1
had	1
one	1
against	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
whom	1
the	1
Holy	1
Brotherhood	1
had	1
ordered	1
to	1
be	1
arrested	1
for	1
setting	1
the	1
galley	1
slaves	1
free,	1
as	1
Sancho	1
had,	1
with	1
very	1
good	1
reason,	1
apprehended.	1
Suspecting	1
how	1
it	1
was,	1
then,	1
he	1
wished	1
to	1
satisfy	1
himself	1
as	1
to	1
whether	1
Don	1
Quixote’s	1
features	1
corresponded;	1
and	1
taking	1
a	1
parchment	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
bosom	1
he	1
lit	1
upon	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
search	1
of,	1
and	1
setting	1
himself	1
to	1
read	1
it	1
deliberately,	1
for	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
quick	1
reader,	1
as	1
he	1
made	1
out	1
each	1
word	1
he	1
fixed	1
his	1
eyes	1
on	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
and	1
went	1
on	1
comparing	1
the	1
description	1
in	1
the	1
warrant	1
with	1
his	1
face,	1
and	1
discovered	1
that	1
beyond	1
all	1
doubt	1
he	1
was	1
the	1
person	1
described	1
in	1
it.	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
satisfied	1
himself,	1
folding	1
up	1
the	1
parchment,	1
he	1
took	1
the	1
warrant	1
in	1
his	1
left	1
hand	1
and	1
with	1
his	1
right	1
seized	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
by	1
the	1
collar	1
so	1
tightly	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
allow	1
him	1
to	1
breathe,	1
and	1
shouted	1
aloud,	1
“Help	1
for	1
the	1
Holy	1
Brotherhood!	1
and	1
that	1
you	1
may	1
see	1
I	1
demand	1
it	1
in	1
earnest,	1
read	1
this	1
warrant	1
which	1
says	1
this	1
highwayman	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
arrested.”	1
The	1
curate	1
took	1
the	1
warrant	1
and	1
saw	1
that	1
what	1
the	1
officer	1
said	1
was	1
true,	1
and	1
that	1
it	1
agreed	1
with	1
Don	1
Quixote’s	1
appearance,	1
who,	1
on	1
his	1
part,	1
when	1
he	1
found	1
himself	1
roughly	1
handled	1
by	1
this	1
rascally	1
clown,	1
worked	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
highest	1
pitch	1
of	1
wrath,	1
and	1
all	1
his	1
joints	1
cracking	1
with	1
rage,	1
with	1
both	1
hands	1
seized	1
the	1
officer	1
by	1
the	1
throat	1
with	1
all	1
his	1
might,	1
so	1
that	1
had	1
he	1
not	1
been	1
helped	1
by	1
his	1
comrades	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
yielded	1
up	1
his	1
life	1
ere	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
released	1
his	1
hold.	1
The	1
landlord,	1
who	1
had	1
perforce	1
to	1
support	1
his	1
brother	1
officers,	1
ran	1
at	1
once	1
to	1
aid	1
them.	1
The	1
landlady,	1
when	1
she	1
saw	1
her	1
husband	1
engaged	1
in	1
a	1
fresh	1
quarrel,	1
lifted	1
up	1
her	1
voice	1
afresh,	1
and	1
its	1
note	1
was	1
immediately	1
caught	1
up	1
by	1
Maritornes	1
and	1
her	1
daughter,	1
calling	1
upon	1
heaven	1
and	1
all	1
present	1
for	1
help;	1
and	1
Sancho,	1
seeing	1
what	1
was	1
going	1
on,	1
exclaimed,	1
“By	1
the	1
Lord,	1
it	1
is	1
quite	1
true	1
what	1
my	1
master	1
says	1
about	1
the	1
enchantments	1
of	1
this	1
castle,	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
impossible	1
to	1
live	1
an	1
hour	1
in	1
peace	1
in	1
it!”	1
Don	1
Fernando	1
parted	1
the	1
officer	1
and	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
and	1
to	1
their	1
mutual	1
contentment	1
made	1
them	1
relax	1
the	1
grip	1
by	1
which	1
they	1
held,	1
the	1
one	1
the	1
coat	1
collar,	1
the	1
other	1
the	1
throat	1
of	1
his	1
adversary;	1
for	1
all	1
this,	1
however,	1
the	1
officers	1
did	1
not	1
cease	1
to	1
demand	1
their	1
prisoner	1
and	1
call	1
on	1
them	1
to	1
help,	1
and	1
deliver	1
him	1
over	1
bound	1
into	1
their	1
power,	1
as	1
was	1
required	1
for	1
the	1
service	1
of	1
the	1
King	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
Holy	1
Brotherhood,	1
on	1
whose	1
behalf	1
they	1
again	1
demanded	1
aid	1
and	1
assistance	1
to	1
effect	1
the	1
capture	1
of	1
this	1
robber	1
and	1
footpad	1
of	1
the	1
highways.	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
smiled	1
when	1
he	1
heard	1
these	1
words,	1
and	1
said	1
very	1
calmly,	1
“Come	1
now,	1
base,	1
ill-born	1
brood;	1
call	1
ye	1
it	1
highway	1
robbery	1
to	1
give	1
freedom	1
to	1
those	1
in	1
bondage,	1
to	1
release	1
the	1
captives,	1
to	1
succour	1
the	1
miserable,	1
to	1
raise	1
up	1
the	1
fallen,	1
to	1
relieve	1
the	1
needy?	1
Infamous	1
beings,	1
who	1
by	1
your	1
vile	1
grovelling	1
intellects	1
deserve	1
that	1
heaven	1
should	1
not	1
make	1
known	1
to	1
you	1
the	1
virtue	1
that	1
lies	1
in	1
knight-errantry,	1
or	1
show	1
you	1
the	1
sin	1
and	1
ignorance	1
in	1
which	1
ye	1
lie	1
when	1
ye	1
refuse	1
to	1
respect	1
the	1
shadow,	1
not	1
to	1
say	1
the	1
presence,	1
of	1
any	1
knight-errant!	1
Come	1
now;	1
band,	1
not	1
of	1
officers,	1
but	1
of	1
thieves;	1
footpads	1
with	1
the	1
licence	1
of	1
the	1
Holy	1
Brotherhood;	1
tell	1
me	1
who	1
was	1
the	1
ignoramus	1
who	1
signed	1
a	1
warrant	1
of	1
arrest	1
against	1
such	1
a	1
knight	1
as	1
I	1
am?	1
Who	1
was	1
he	1
that	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
that	1
knights-errant	1
are	1
independent	1
of	1
all	1
jurisdictions,	1
that	1
their	1
law	1
is	1
their	1
sword,	1
their	1
charter	1
their	1
prowess,	1
and	1
their	1
edicts	1
their	1
will?	1
Who,	1
I	1
say	1
again,	1
was	1
the	1
fool	1
that	1
knows	1
not	1
that	1
there	1
are	1
no	1
letters	1
patent	1
of	1
nobility	1
that	1
confer	1
such	1
privileges	1
or	1
exemptions	1
as	1
a	1
knight-errant	1
acquires	1
the	1
day	1
he	1
is	1
dubbed	1
a	1
knight,	1
and	1
devotes	1
himself	1
to	1
the	1
arduous	1
calling	1
of	1
chivalry?	1
What	1
knight-errant	1
ever	1
paid	1
poll-tax,	1
duty,	1
queen’s	1
pin-money,	1
king’s	1
dues,	1
toll	1
or	1
ferry?	1
What	1
tailor	1
ever	1
took	1
payment	1
of	1
him	1
for	1
making	1
his	1
clothes?	1
What	1
castellan	1
that	1
received	1
him	1
in	1
his	1
castle	1
ever	1
made	1
him	1
pay	1
his	1
shot?	1
What	1
king	1
did	1
not	1
seat	1
him	1
at	1
his	1
table?	1
What	1
damsel	1
was	1
not	1
enamoured	1
of	1
him	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
yield	1
herself	1
up	1
wholly	1
to	1
his	1
will	1
and	1
pleasure?	1
And,	1
lastly,	1
what	1
knight-errant	1
has	1
there	1
been,	1
is	1
there,	1
or	1
will	1
there	1
ever	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
world,	1
not	1
bold	1
enough	1
to	1
give,	1
single-handed,	1
four	1
hundred	1
cudgellings	1
to	1
four	1
hundred	1
officers	1
of	1
the	1
Holy	1
Brotherhood	1
if	1
they	1
come	1
in	1
his	1
way?”	1

While	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
was	1
talking	1
in	1
this	1
strain,	1
the	1
curate	1
was	1
endeavouring	1
to	1
persuade	1
the	1
officers	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
senses,	1
as	1
they	1
might	1
perceive	1
by	1
his	1
deeds	1
and	1
his	1
words,	1
and	1
that	1
they	1
need	1
not	1
press	1
the	1
matter	1
any	1
further,	1
for	1
even	1
if	1
they	1
arrested	1
him	1
and	1
carried	1
him	1
off,	1
they	1
would	1
have	1
to	1
release	1
him	1
by-and-by	1
as	1
a	1
madman;	1
to	1
which	1
the	1
holder	1
of	1
the	1
warrant	1
replied	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
nothing	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
inquiring	1
into	1
Don	1
Quixote’s	1
madness,	1
but	1
only	1
to	1
execute	1
his	1
superior’s	1
orders,	1
and	1
that	1
once	1
taken	1
they	1
might	1
let	1
him	1
go	1
three	1
hundred	1
times	1
if	1
they	1
liked.	1
“For	1
all	1
that,”	1
said	1
the	1
curate,	1
“you	1
must	1
not	1
take	1
him	1
away	1
this	1
time,	1
nor	1
will	1
he,	1
it	1
is	1
my	1
opinion,	1
let	1
himself	1
be	1
taken	1
away.”	1
In	1
short,	1
the	1
curate	1
used	1
such	1
arguments,	1
and	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
did	1
such	1
mad	1
things,	1
that	1
the	1
officers	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
more	1
mad	1
than	1
he	1
was	1
if	1
they	1
had	1
not	1
perceived	1
his	1
want	1
of	1
wits,	1
and	1
so	1
they	1
thought	1
it	1
best	1
to	1
allow	1
themselves	1
to	1
be	1
pacified,	1
and	1
even	1
to	1
act	1
as	1
peacemakers	1
between	1
the	1
barber	1
and	1
Sancho	1
Panza,	1
who	1
still	1
continued	1
their	1
altercation	1
with	1
much	1
bitterness.	1
In	1
the	1
end	1
they,	1
as	1
officers	1
of	1
justice,	1
settled	1
the	1
question	1
by	1
arbitration	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
manner	1
that	1
both	1
sides	1
were,	1
if	1
not	1
perfectly	1
contented,	1
at	1
least	1
to	1
some	1
extent	1
satisfied;	1
for	1
they	1
changed	1
the	1
pack-saddles,	1
but	1
not	1
the	1
girths	1
or	1
head-stalls;	1
and	1
as	1
to	1
Mambrino’s	1
helmet,	1
the	1
curate,	1
under	1
the	1
rose	1
and	1
without	1
Don	1
Quixote’s	1
knowing	1
it,	1
paid	1
eight	1
reals	1
for	1
the	1
basin,	1
and	1
the	1
barber	1
executed	1
a	1
full	1
receipt	1
and	1
engagement	1
to	1
make	1
no	1
further	1
demand	1
then	1
or	1
thenceforth	1
for	1
evermore,	1
amen.	1
These	1
two	1
disputes,	1
which	1
were	1
the	1
most	1
important	1
and	1
gravest,	1
being	1
settled,	1
it	1
only	1
remained	1
for	1
the	1
servants	1
of	1
Don	1
Luis	1
to	1
consent	1
that	1
three	1
of	1
them	1
should	1
return	1
while	1
one	1
was	1
left	1
to	1
accompany	1
him	1
whither	1
Don	1
Fernando	1
desired	1
to	1
take	1
him;	1
and	1
good	1
luck	1
and	1
better	1
fortune,	1
having	1
already	1
begun	1
to	1
solve	1
difficulties	1
and	1
remove	1
obstructions	1
in	1
favour	1
of	1
the	1
lovers	1
and	1
warriors	1
of	1
the	1
inn,	1
were	1
pleased	1
to	1
persevere	1
and	1
bring	1
everything	1
to	1
a	1
happy	1
issue;	1
for	1
the	1
servants	1
agreed	1
to	1
do	1
as	1
Don	1
Luis	1
wished;	1
which	1
gave	1
Doña	1
Clara	1
such	1
happiness	1
that	1
no	1
one	1
could	1
have	1
looked	1
into	1
her	1
face	1
just	1
then	1
without	1
seeing	1
the	1
joy	1
of	1
her	1
heart.	1
Zoraida,	1
though	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
fully	1
comprehend	1
all	1
she	1
saw,	1
was	1
grave	1
or	1
gay	1
without	1
knowing	1
why,	1
as	1
she	1
watched	1
and	1
studied	1
the	1
various	1
countenances,	1
but	1
particularly	1
her	1
Spaniard’s,	1
whom	1
she	1
followed	1
with	1
her	1
eyes	1
and	1
clung	1
to	1
with	1
her	1
soul.	1
The	1
gift	1
and	1
compensation	1
which	1
the	1
curate	1
gave	1
the	1
barber	1
had	1
not	1
escaped	1
the	1
landlord’s	1
notice,	1
and	1
he	1
demanded	1
Don	1
Quixote’s	1
reckoning,	1
together	1
with	1
the	1
amount	1
of	1
the	1
damage	1
to	1
his	1
wine-skins,	1
and	1
the	1
loss	1
of	1
his	1
wine,	1
swearing	1
that	1
neither	1
Rocinante	1
nor	1
Sancho’s	1
ass	1
should	1
leave	1
the	1
inn	1
until	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
paid	1
to	1
the	1
very	1
last	1
farthing.	1
The	1
curate	1
settled	1
all	1
amicably,	1
and	1
Don	1
Fernando	1
paid;	1
though	1
the	1
Judge	1
had	1
also	1
very	1
readily	1
offered	1
to	1
pay	1
the	1
score;	1
and	1
all	1
became	1
so	1
peaceful	1
and	1
quiet	1
that	1
the	1
inn	1
no	1
longer	1
reminded	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
discord	1
of	1
Agramante’s	1
camp,	1
as	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
said,	1
but	1
of	1
the	1
peace	1
and	1
tranquillity	1
of	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
Octavianus:	1
for	1
all	1
which	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
universal	1
opinion	1
that	1
their	1
thanks	1
were	1
due	1
to	1
the	1
great	1
zeal	1
and	1
eloquence	1
of	1
the	1
curate,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
unexampled	1
generosity	1
of	1
Don	1
Fernando.	1
Finding	1
himself	1
now	1
clear	1
and	1
quit	1
of	1
all	1
quarrels,	1
his	1
squire’s	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
his	1
own,	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
considered	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
advisable	1
to	1
continue	1
the	1
journey	1
he	1
had	1
begun,	1
and	1
bring	1
to	1
a	1
close	1
that	1
great	1
adventure	1
for	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
called	1
and	1
chosen;	1
and	1
with	1
this	1
high	1
resolve	1
he	1
went	1
and	1
knelt	1
before	1
Dorothea,	1
who,	1
however,	1
would	1
not	1
allow	1
him	1
to	1
utter	1
a	1
word	1
until	1
he	1
had	1
risen;	1
so	1
to	1
obey	1
her	1
he	1
rose,	1
and	1
said,	1
“It	1
is	1
a	1
common	1
proverb,	1
fair	1
lady,	1
that	1
‘diligence	1
is	1
the	1
mother	1
of	1
good	1
fortune,’	1
and	1
experience	1
has	1
often	1
shown	1
in	1
important	1
affairs	1
that	1
the	1
earnestness	1
of	1
the	1
negotiator	1
brings	1
the	1
doubtful	1
case	1
to	1
a	1
successful	1
termination;	1
but	1
in	1
nothing	1
does	1
this	1
truth	1
show	1
itself	1
more	1
plainly	1
than	1
in	1
war,	1
where	1
quickness	1
and	1
activity	1
forestall	1
the	1
devices	1
of	1
the	1
enemy,	1
and	1
win	1
the	1
victory	1
before	1
the	1
foe	1
has	1
time	1
to	1
defend	1
himself.	1
All	1
this	1
I	1
say,	1
exalted	1
and	1
esteemed	1
lady,	1
because	1
it	1
seems	1
to	1
me	1
that	1
for	1
us	1
to	1
remain	1
any	1
longer	1
in	1
this	1
castle	1
now	1
is	1
useless,	1
and	1
may	1
be	1
injurious	1
to	1
us	1
in	1
a	1
way	1
that	1
we	1
shall	1
find	1
out	1
some	1
day;	1
for	1
who	1
knows	1
but	1
that	1
your	1
enemy	1
the	1
giant	1
may	1
have	1
learned	1
by	1
means	1
of	1
secret	1
and	1
diligent	1
spies	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
going	1
to	1
destroy	1
him,	1
and	1
if	1
the	1
opportunity	1
be	1
given	1
him	1
he	1
may	1
seize	1
it	1
to	1
fortify	1
himself	1
in	1
some	1
impregnable	1
castle	1
or	1
stronghold,	1
against	1
which	1
all	1
my	1
efforts	1
and	1
the	1
might	1
of	1
my	1
indefatigable	1
arm	1
may	1
avail	1
but	1
little?	1
Therefore,	1
lady,	1
let	1
us,	1
as	1
I	1
say,	1
forestall	1
his	1
schemes	1
by	1
our	1
activity,	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
depart	1
at	1
once	1
in	1
quest	1
of	1
fair	1
fortune;	1
for	1
your	1
highness	1
is	1
only	1
kept	1
from	1
enjoying	1
it	1
as	1
fully	1
as	1
you	1
could	1
desire	1
by	1
my	1
delay	1
in	1
encountering	1
your	1
adversary.”	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
held	1
his	1
peace	1
and	1
said	1
no	1
more,	1
calmly	1
awaiting	1
the	1
reply	1
of	1
the	1
beauteous	1
princess,	1
who,	1
with	1
commanding	1
dignity	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
style	1
adapted	1
to	1
Don	1
Quixote’s	1
own,	1
replied	1
to	1
him	1
in	1
these	1
words,	1
“I	1
give	1
you	1
thanks,	1
sir	1
knight,	1
for	1
the	1
eagerness	1
you,	1
like	1
a	1
good	1
knight	1
to	1
whom	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
natural	1
obligation	1
to	1
succour	1
the	1
orphan	1
and	1
the	1
needy,	1
display	1
to	1
afford	1
me	1
aid	1
in	1
my	1
sore	1
trouble;	1
and	1
heaven	1
grant	1
that	1
your	1
wishes	1
and	1
mine	1
may	1
be	1
realised,	1
so	1
that	1
you	1
may	1
see	1
that	1
there	1
are	1
women	1
in	1
this	1
world	1
capable	1
of	1
gratitude;	1
as	1
to	1
my	1
departure,	1
let	1
it	1
be	1
forthwith,	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
will	1
but	1
yours;	1
dispose	1
of	1
me	1
entirely	1
in	1
accordance	1
with	1
your	1
good	1
pleasure;	1
for	1
she	1
who	1
has	1
once	1
entrusted	1
to	1
you	1
the	1
defence	1
of	1
her	1
person,	1
and	1
placed	1
in	1
your	1
hands	1
the	1
recovery	1
of	1
her	1
dominions,	1
must	1
not	1
think	1
of	1
offering	1
opposition	1
to	1
that	1
which	1
your	1
wisdom	1
may	1
ordain.”	1
“On,	1
then,	1
in	1
God’s	1
name,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
“for,	1
when	1
a	1
lady	1
humbles	1
herself	1
to	1
me,	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
lose	1
the	1
opportunity	1
of	1
raising	1
her	1
up	1
and	1
placing	1
her	1
on	1
the	1
throne	1
of	1
her	1
ancestors.	1
Let	1
us	1
depart	1
at	1
once,	1
for	1
the	1
common	1
saying	1
that	1
in	1
delay	1
there	1
is	1
danger,	1
lends	1
spurs	1
to	1
my	1
eagerness	1
to	1
take	1
the	1
road;	1
and	1
as	1
neither	1
heaven	1
has	1
created	1
nor	1
hell	1
seen	1
any	1
that	1
can	1
daunt	1
or	1
intimidate	1
me,	1
saddle	1
Rocinante,	1
Sancho,	1
and	1
get	1
ready	1
thy	1
ass	1
and	1
the	1
queen’s	1
palfrey,	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
take	1
leave	1
of	1
the	1
castellan	1
and	1
these	1
gentlemen,	1
and	1
go	1
hence	1
this	1
very	1
instant.”	1
Sancho,	1
who	1
was	1
standing	1
by	1
all	1
the	1
time,	1
said,	1
shaking	1
his	1
head,	1
“Ah!	1
master,	1
master,	1
there	1
is	1
more	1
mischief	1
in	1
the	1
village	1
than	1
one	1
hears	1
of,	1
begging	1
all	1
good	1
bodies’	1
pardon.”	1
“What	1
mischief	1
can	1
there	1
be	1
in	1
any	1
village,	1
or	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
cities	1
of	1
the	1
world,	1
you	1
booby,	1
that	1
can	1
hurt	1
my	1
reputation?”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote.	1
“If	1
your	1
worship	1
is	1
angry,”	1
replied	1
Sancho,	1
“I	1
will	1
hold	1
my	1
tongue	1
and	1
leave	1
unsaid	1
what	1
as	1
a	1
good	1
squire	1
I	1
am	1
bound	1
to	1
say,	1
and	1
what	1
a	1
good	1
servant	1
should	1
tell	1
his	1
master.”	1
“Say	1
what	1
thou	1
wilt,”	1
returned	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“provided	1
thy	1
words	1
be	1
not	1
meant	1
to	1
work	1
upon	1
my	1
fears;	1
for	1
thou,	1
if	1
thou	1
fearest,	1
art	1
behaving	1
like	1
thyself;	1
but	1
I	1
like	1
myself,	1
in	1
not	1
fearing.”	1
“It	1
is	1
nothing	1
of	1
the	1
sort,	1
as	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
sinner	1
before	1
God,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“but	1
that	1
I	1
take	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
sure	1
and	1
certain	1
that	1
this	1
lady,	1
who	1
calls	1
herself	1
queen	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
kingdom	1
of	1
Micomicon,	1
is	1
no	1
more	1
so	1
than	1
my	1
mother;	1
for,	1
if	1
she	1
was	1
what	1
she	1
says,	1
she	1
would	1
not	1
go	1
rubbing	1
noses	1
with	1
one	1
that	1
is	1
here	1
every	1
instant	1
and	1
behind	1
every	1
door.”	1
Dorothea	1
turned	1
red	1
at	1
Sancho’s	1
words,	1
for	1
the	1
truth	1
was	1
that	1
her	1
husband	1
Don	1
Fernando	1
had	1
now	1
and	1
then,	1
when	1
the	1
others	1
were	1
not	1
looking,	1
gathered	1
from	1
her	1
lips	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
reward	1
his	1
love	1
had	1
earned,	1
and	1
Sancho	1
seeing	1
this	1
had	1
considered	1
that	1
such	1
freedom	1
was	1
more	1
like	1
a	1
courtesan	1
than	1
a	1
queen	1
of	1
a	1
great	1
kingdom;	1
she,	1
however,	1
being	1
unable	1
or	1
not	1
caring	1
to	1
answer	1
him,	1
allowed	1
him	1
to	1
proceed,	1
and	1
he	1
continued,	1
“This	1
I	1
say,	1
señor,	1
because,	1
if	1
after	1
we	1
have	1
travelled	1
roads	1
and	1
highways,	1
and	1
passed	1
bad	1
nights	1
and	1
worse	1
days,	1
one	1
who	1
is	1
now	1
enjoying	1
himself	1
in	1
this	1
inn	1
is	1
to	1
reap	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
our	1
labours,	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
need	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
a	1
hurry	1
to	1
saddle	1
Rocinante,	1
put	1
the	1
pad	1
on	1
the	1
ass,	1
or	1
get	1
ready	1
the	1
palfrey;	1
for	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
better	1
for	1
us	1
to	1
stay	1
quiet,	1
and	1
let	1
every	1
jade	1
mind	1
her	1
spinning,	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
go	1
to	1
dinner.”	1
Good	1
God,	1
what	1
was	1
the	1
indignation	1
of	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
when	1
he	1
heard	1
the	1
audacious	1
words	1
of	1
his	1
squire!	1
So	1
great	1
was	1
it,	1
that	1
in	1
a	1
voice	1
inarticulate	1
with	1
rage,	1
with	1
a	1
stammering	1
tongue,	1
and	1
eyes	1
that	1
flashed	1
living	1
fire,	1
he	1
exclaimed,	1
“Rascally	1
clown,	1
boorish,	1
insolent,	1
and	1
ignorant,	1
ill-spoken,	1
foul-mouthed,	1
impudent	1
backbiter	1
and	1
slanderer!	1
Hast	1
thou	1
dared	1
to	1
utter	1
such	1
words	1
in	1
my	1
presence	1
and	1
in	1
that	1
of	1
these	1
illustrious	1
ladies?	1
Hast	1
thou	1
dared	1
to	1
harbour	1
such	1
gross	1
and	1
shameless	1
thoughts	1
in	1
thy	1
muddled	1
imagination?	1
Begone	1
from	1
my	1
presence,	1
thou	1
born	1
monster,	1
storehouse	1
of	1
lies,	1
hoard	1
of	1
untruths,	1
garner	1
of	1
knaveries,	1
inventor	1
of	1
scandals,	1
publisher	1
of	1
absurdities,	1
enemy	1
of	1
the	1
respect	1
due	1
to	1
royal	1
personages!	1
Begone,	1
show	1
thyself	1
no	1
more	1
before	1
me	1
under	1
pain	1
of	1
my	1
wrath;”	1
and	1
so	1
saying	1
he	1
knitted	1
his	1
brows,	1
puffed	1
out	1
his	1
cheeks,	1
gazed	1
around	1
him,	1
and	1
stamped	1
on	1
the	1
ground	1
violently	1
with	1
his	1
right	1
foot,	1
showing	1
in	1
every	1
way	1
the	1
rage	1
that	1
was	1
pent	1
up	1
in	1
his	1
heart;	1
and	1
at	1
his	1
words	1
and	1
furious	1
gestures	1
Sancho	1
was	1
so	1
scared	1
and	1
terrified	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
glad	1
if	1
the	1
earth	1
had	1
opened	1
that	1
instant	1
and	1
swallowed	1
him,	1
and	1
his	1
only	1
thought	1
was	1
to	1
turn	1
round	1
and	1
make	1
his	1
escape	1
from	1
the	1
angry	1
presence	1
of	1
his	1
master.	1
But	1
the	1
ready-witted	1
Dorothea,	1
who	1
by	1
this	1
time	1
so	1
well	1
understood	1
Don	1
Quixote’s	1
humour,	1
said,	1
to	1
mollify	1
his	1
wrath,	1
“Be	1
not	1
irritated	1
at	1
the	1
absurdities	1
your	1
good	1
squire	1
has	1
uttered,	1
Sir	1
Knight	1
of	1
the	1
Rueful	1
Countenance,	1
for	1
perhaps	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
utter	1
them	1
without	1
cause,	1
and	1
from	1
his	1
good	1
sense	1
and	1
Christian	1
conscience	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
likely	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
bear	1
false	1
witness	1
against	1
anyone.	1
We	1
may	1
therefore	1
believe,	1
without	1
any	1
hesitation,	1
that	1
since,	1
as	1
you	1
say,	1
sir	1
knight,	1
everything	1
in	1
this	1
castle	1
goes	1
and	1
is	1
brought	1
about	1
by	1
means	1
of	1
enchantment,	1
Sancho,	1
I	1
say,	1
may	1
possibly	1
have	1
seen,	1
through	1
this	1
diabolical	1
medium,	1
what	1
he	1
says	1
he	1
saw	1
so	1
much	1
to	1
the	1
detriment	1
of	1
my	1
modesty.”	1
“I	1
swear	1
by	1
God	1
Omnipotent,”	1
exclaimed	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
at	1
this,	1
“your	1
highness	1
has	1
hit	1
the	1
point;	1
and	1
that	1
some	1
vile	1
illusion	1
must	1
have	1
come	1
before	1
this	1
sinner	1
of	1
a	1
Sancho,	1
that	1
made	1
him	1
see	1
what	1
it	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
impossible	1
to	1
see	1
by	1
any	1
other	1
means	1
than	1
enchantments;	1
for	1
I	1
know	1
well	1
enough,	1
from	1
the	1
poor	1
fellow’s	1
goodness	1
and	1
harmlessness,	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
incapable	1
of	1
bearing	1
false	1
witness	1
against	1
anybody.”	1
“True,	1
no	1
doubt,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Fernando,	1
“for	1
which	1
reason,	1
Señor	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
you	1
ought	1
to	1
forgive	1
him	1
and	1
restore	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
bosom	1
of	1
your	1
favour,	1
_sicut	1
erat	1
in	1
principio_,	1
before	1
illusions	1
of	1
this	1
sort	1
had	1
taken	1
away	1
his	1
senses.”	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
said	1
he	1
was	1
ready	1
to	1
pardon	1
him,	1
and	1
the	1
curate	1
went	1
for	1
Sancho,	1
who	1
came	1
in	1
very	1
humbly,	1
and	1
falling	1
on	1
his	1
knees	1
begged	1
for	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
his	1
master,	1
who	1
having	1
presented	1
it	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
allowed	1
him	1
to	1
kiss	1
it,	1
gave	1
him	1
his	1
blessing	1
and	1
said,	1
“Now,	1
Sancho	1
my	1
son,	1
thou	1
wilt	1
be	1
convinced	1
of	1
the	1
truth	1
of	1
what	1
I	1
have	1
many	1
a	1
time	1
told	1
thee,	1
that	1
everything	1
in	1
this	1
castle	1
is	1
done	1
by	1
means	1
of	1
enchantment.”	1
“So	1
it	1
is,	1
I	1
believe,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“except	1
the	1
affair	1
of	1
the	1
blanket,	1
which	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
reality	1
by	1
ordinary	1
means.”	1
“Believe	1
it	1
not,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“for	1
had	1
it	1
been	1
so,	1
I	1
would	1
have	1
avenged	1
thee	1
that	1
instant,	1
or	1
even	1
now;	1
but	1
neither	1
then	1
nor	1
now	1
could	1
I,	1
nor	1
have	1
I	1
seen	1
anyone	1
upon	1
whom	1
to	1
avenge	1
thy	1
wrong.”	1
They	1
were	1
all	1
eager	1
to	1
know	1
what	1
the	1
affair	1
of	1
the	1
blanket	1
was,	1
and	1
the	1
landlord	1
gave	1
them	1
a	1
minute	1
account	1
of	1
Sancho’s	1
flights,	1
at	1
which	1
they	1
laughed	1
not	1
a	1
little,	1
and	1
at	1
which	1
Sancho	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
no	1
less	1
out	1
of	1
countenance	1
had	1
not	1
his	1
master	1
once	1
more	1
assured	1
him	1
it	1
was	1
all	1
enchantment.	1
For	1
all	1
that	1
his	1
simplicity	1
never	1
reached	1
so	1
high	1
a	1
pitch	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
persuade	1
himself	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
the	1
plain	1
and	1
simple	1
truth,	1
without	1
any	1
deception	1
whatever	1
about	1
it,	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
blanketed	1
by	1
beings	1
of	1
flesh	1
and	1
blood,	1
and	1
not	1
by	1
visionary	1
and	1
imaginary	1
phantoms,	1
as	1
his	1
master	1
believed	1
and	1
protested.	1
The	1
illustrious	1
company	1
had	1
now	1
been	1
two	1
days	1
in	1
the	1
inn;	1
and	1
as	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
them	1
time	1
to	1
depart,	1
they	1
devised	1
a	1
plan	1
so	1
that,	1
without	1
giving	1
Dorothea	1
and	1
Don	1
Fernando	1
the	1
trouble	1
of	1
going	1
back	1
with	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
to	1
his	1
village	1
under	1
pretence	1
of	1
restoring	1
Queen	1
Micomicona,	1
the	1
curate	1
and	1
the	1
barber	1
might	1
carry	1
him	1
away	1
with	1
them	1
as	1
they	1
proposed,	1
and	1
the	1
curate	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
take	1
his	1
madness	1
in	1
hand	1
at	1
home;	1
and	1
in	1
pursuance	1
of	1
their	1
plan	1
they	1
arranged	1
with	1
the	1
owner	1
of	1
an	1
oxcart	1
who	1
happened	1
to	1
be	1
passing	1
that	1
way	1
to	1
carry	1
him	1
after	1
this	1
fashion.	1
They	1
constructed	1
a	1
kind	1
of	1
cage	1
with	1
wooden	1
bars,	1
large	1
enough	1
to	1
hold	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
comfortably;	1
and	1
then	1
Don	1
Fernando	1
and	1
his	1
companions,	1
the	1
servants	1
of	1
Don	1
Luis,	1
and	1
the	1
officers	1
of	1
the	1
Brotherhood,	1
together	1
with	1
the	1
landlord,	1
by	1
the	1
directions	1
and	1
advice	1
of	1
the	1
curate,	1
covered	1
their	1
faces	1
and	1
disguised	1
themselves,	1
some	1
in	1
one	1
way,	1
some	1
in	1
another,	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
appear	1
to	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
quite	1
different	1
from	1
the	1
persons	1
he	1
had	1
seen	1
in	1
the	1
castle.	1
This	1
done,	1
in	1
profound	1
silence	1
they	1
entered	1
the	1
room	1
where	1
he	1
was	1
asleep,	1
taking	1
his	1
rest	1
after	1
the	1
past	1
frays,	1
and	1
advancing	1
to	1
where	1
he	1
was	1
sleeping	1
tranquilly,	1
not	1
dreaming	1
of	1
anything	1
of	1
the	1
kind	1
happening,	1
they	1
seized	1
him	1
firmly	1
and	1
bound	1
him	1
fast	1
hand	1
and	1
foot,	1
so	1
that,	1
when	1
he	1
awoke	1
startled,	1
he	1
was	1
unable	1
to	1
move,	1
and	1
could	1
only	1
marvel	1
and	1
wonder	1
at	1
the	1
strange	1
figures	1
he	1
saw	1
before	1
him;	1
upon	1
which	1
he	1
at	1
once	1
gave	1
way	1
to	1
the	1
idea	1
which	1
his	1
crazed	1
fancy	1
invariably	1
conjured	1
up	1
before	1
him,	1
and	1
took	1
it	1
into	1
his	1
head	1
that	1
all	1
these	1
shapes	1
were	1
phantoms	1
of	1
the	1
enchanted	1
castle,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
himself	1
was	1
unquestionably	1
enchanted	1
as	1
he	1
could	1
neither	1
move	1
nor	1
help	1
himself;	1
precisely	1
what	1
the	1
curate,	1
the	1
concoctor	1
of	1
the	1
scheme,	1
expected	1
would	1
happen.	1
Of	1
all	1
that	1
were	1
there	1
Sancho	1
was	1
the	1
only	1
one	1
who	1
was	1
at	1
once	1
in	1
his	1
senses	1
and	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
proper	1
character,	1
and	1
he,	1
though	1
he	1
was	1
within	1
very	1
little	1
of	1
sharing	1
his	1
master’s	1
infirmity,	1
did	1
not	1
fail	1
to	1
perceive	1
who	1
all	1
these	1
disguised	1
figures	1
were;	1
but	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
dare	1
to	1
open	1
his	1
lips	1
until	1
he	1
saw	1
what	1
came	1
of	1
this	1
assault	1
and	1
capture	1
of	1
his	1
master;	1
nor	1
did	1
the	1
latter	1
utter	1
a	1
word,	1
waiting	1
to	1
the	1
upshot	1
of	1
his	1
mishap;	1
which	1
was	1
that	1
bringing	1
in	1
the	1
cage,	1
they	1
shut	1
him	1
up	1
in	1
it	1
and	1
nailed	1
the	1
bars	1
so	1
firmly	1
that	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
easily	1
burst	1
open.	1

They	1
then	1
took	1
him	1
on	1
their	1
shoulders,	1
and	1
as	1
they	1
passed	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
an	1
awful	1
voice—as	1
much	1
so	1
as	1
the	1
barber,	1
not	1
he	1
of	1
the	1
pack-saddle	1
but	1
the	1
other,	1
was	1
able	1
to	1
make	1
it—was	1
heard	1
to	1
say,	1
“O	1
Knight	1
of	1
the	1
Rueful	1
Countenance,	1
let	1
not	1
this	1
captivity	1
in	1
which	1
thou	1
art	1
placed	1
afflict	1
thee,	1
for	1
this	1
must	1
needs	1
be,	1
for	1
the	1
more	1
speedy	1
accomplishment	1
of	1
the	1
adventure	1
in	1
which	1
thy	1
great	1
heart	1
has	1
engaged	1
thee;	1
the	1
which	1
shall	1
be	1
accomplished	1
when	1
the	1
raging	1
Manchegan	1
lion	1
and	1
the	1
white	1
Tobosan	1
dove	1
shall	1
be	1
linked	1
together,	1
having	1
first	1
humbled	1
their	1
haughty	1
necks	1
to	1
the	1
gentle	1
yoke	1
of	1
matrimony.	1
And	1
from	1
this	1
marvellous	1
union	1
shall	1
come	1
forth	1
to	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
brave	1
whelps	1
that	1
shall	1
rival	1
the	1
ravening	1
claws	1
of	1
their	1
valiant	1
father;	1
and	1
this	1
shall	1
come	1
to	1
pass	1
ere	1
the	1
pursuer	1
of	1
the	1
flying	1
nymph	1
shall	1
in	1
his	1
swift	1
natural	1
course	1
have	1
twice	1
visited	1
the	1
starry	1
signs.	1
And	1
thou,	1
O	1
most	1
noble	1
and	1
obedient	1
squire	1
that	1
ever	1
bore	1
sword	1
at	1
side,	1
beard	1
on	1
face,	1
or	1
nose	1
to	1
smell	1
with,	1
be	1
not	1
dismayed	1
or	1
grieved	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
flower	1
of	1
knight-errantry	1
carried	1
away	1
thus	1
before	1
thy	1
very	1
eyes;	1
for	1
soon,	1
if	1
it	1
so	1
please	1
the	1
Framer	1
of	1
the	1
universe,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
see	1
thyself	1
exalted	1
to	1
such	1
a	1
height	1
that	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
know	1
thyself,	1
and	1
the	1
promises	1
which	1
thy	1
good	1
master	1
has	1
made	1
thee	1
shall	1
not	1
prove	1
false;	1
and	1
I	1
assure	1
thee,	1
on	1
the	1
authority	1
of	1
the	1
sage	1
Mentironiana,	1
that	1
thy	1
wages	1
shall	1
be	1
paid	1
thee,	1
as	1
thou	1
shalt	1
see	1
in	1
due	1
season.	1
Follow	1
then	1
the	1
footsteps	1
of	1
the	1
valiant	1
enchanted	1
knight,	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
expedient	1
that	1
thou	1
shouldst	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
destination	1
assigned	1
to	1
both	1
of	1
you;	1
and	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
permitted	1
to	1
me	1
to	1
say	1
more,	1
God	1
be	1
with	1
thee;	1
for	1
I	1
return	1
to	1
that	1
place	1
I	1
wot	1
of;”	1
and	1
as	1
he	1
brought	1
the	1
prophecy	1
to	1
a	1
close	1
he	1
raised	1
his	1
voice	1
to	1
a	1
high	1
pitch,	1
and	1
then	1
lowered	1
it	1
to	1
such	1
a	1
soft	1
tone,	1
that	1
even	1
those	1
who	1
knew	1
it	1
was	1
all	1
a	1
joke	1
were	1
almost	1
inclined	1
to	1
take	1
what	1
they	1
heard	1
seriously.	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
was	1
comforted	1
by	1
the	1
prophecy	1
he	1
heard,	1
for	1
he	1
at	1
once	1
comprehended	1
its	1
meaning	1
perfectly,	1
and	1
perceived	1
it	1
was	1
promised	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
see	1
himself	1
united	1
in	1
holy	1
and	1
lawful	1
matrimony	1
with	1
his	1
beloved	1
Dulcinea	1
del	1
Toboso,	1
from	1
whose	1
blessed	1
womb	1
should	1
proceed	1
the	1
whelps,	1
his	1
sons,	1
to	1
the	1
eternal	1
glory	1
of	1
La	1
Mancha;	1
and	1
being	1
thoroughly	1
and	1
firmly	1
persuaded	1
of	1
this,	1
he	1
lifted	1
up	1
his	1
voice,	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
deep	1
sigh	1
exclaimed,	1
“Oh	1
thou,	1
whoever	1
thou	1
art,	1
who	1
hast	1
foretold	1
me	1
so	1
much	1
good,	1
I	1
implore	1
of	1
thee	1
that	1
on	1
my	1
part	1
thou	1
entreat	1
that	1
sage	1
enchanter	1
who	1
takes	1
charge	1
of	1
my	1
interests,	1
that	1
he	1
leave	1
me	1
not	1
to	1
perish	1
in	1
this	1
captivity	1
in	1
which	1
they	1
are	1
now	1
carrying	1
me	1
away,	1
ere	1
I	1
see	1
fulfilled	1
promises	1
so	1
joyful	1
and	1
incomparable	1
as	1
those	1
which	1
have	1
been	1
now	1
made	1
me;	1
for,	1
let	1
this	1
but	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
and	1
I	1
shall	1
glory	1
in	1
the	1
pains	1
of	1
my	1
prison,	1
find	1
comfort	1
in	1
these	1
chains	1
wherewith	1
they	1
bind	1
me,	1
and	1
regard	1
this	1
bed	1
whereon	1
they	1
stretch	1
me,	1
not	1
as	1
a	1
hard	1
battle-field,	1
but	1
as	1
a	1
soft	1
and	1
happy	1
nuptial	1
couch;	1
and	1
touching	1
the	1
consolation	1
of	1
Sancho	1
Panza,	1
my	1
squire,	1
I	1
rely	1
upon	1
his	1
goodness	1
and	1
rectitude	1
that	1
he	1
will	1
not	1
desert	1
me	1
in	1
good	1
or	1
evil	1
fortune;	1
for	1
if,	1
by	1
his	1
ill	1
luck	1
or	1
mine,	1
it	1
may	1
not	1
happen	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
my	1
power	1
to	1
give	1
him	1
the	1
island	1
I	1
have	1
promised,	1
or	1
any	1
equivalent	1
for	1
it,	1
at	1
least	1
his	1
wages	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
lost;	1
for	1
in	1
my	1
will,	1
which	1
is	1
already	1
made,	1
I	1
have	1
declared	1
the	1
sum	1
that	1
shall	1
be	1
paid	1
to	1
him,	1
measured,	1
not	1
by	1
his	1
many	1
faithful	1
services,	1
but	1
by	1
the	1
means	1
at	1
my	1
disposal.”	1
Sancho	1
bowed	1
his	1
head	1
very	1
respectfully	1
and	1
kissed	1
both	1
his	1
hands,	1
for,	1
being	1
tied	1
together,	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
kiss	1
one;	1
and	1
then	1
the	1
apparitions	1
lifted	1
the	1
cage	1
upon	1
their	1
shoulders	1
and	1
fixed	1
it	1
upon	1
the	1
ox-cart.	1

When	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
saw	1
himself	1
caged	1
and	1
hoisted	1
on	1
the	1
cart	1
in	1
this	1
way,	1
he	1
said,	1
“Many	1
grave	1
histories	1
of	1
knights-errant	1
have	1
I	1
read;	1
but	1
never	1
yet	1
have	1
I	1
read,	1
seen,	1
or	1
heard	1
of	1
their	1
carrying	1
off	1
enchanted	1
knights-errant	1
in	1
this	1
fashion,	1
or	1
at	1
the	1
slow	1
pace	1
that	1
these	1
lazy,	1
sluggish	1
animals	1
promise;	1
for	1
they	1
always	1
take	1
them	1
away	1
through	1
the	1
air	1
with	1
marvellous	1
swiftness,	1
enveloped	1
in	1
a	1
dark	1
thick	1
cloud,	1
or	1
on	1
a	1
chariot	1
of	1
fire,	1
or	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
on	1
some	1
hippogriff	1
or	1
other	1
beast	1
of	1
the	1
kind;	1
but	1
to	1
carry	1
me	1
off	1
like	1
this	1
on	1
an	1
ox-cart!	1
By	1
God,	1
it	1
puzzles	1
me!	1
But	1
perhaps	1
the	1
chivalry	1
and	1
enchantments	1
of	1
our	1
day	1
take	1
a	1
different	1
course	1
from	1
that	1
of	1
those	1
in	1
days	1
gone	1
by;	1
and	1
it	1
may	1
be,	1
too,	1
that	1
as	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
new	1
knight	1
in	1
the	1
world,	1
and	1
the	1
first	1
to	1
revive	1
the	1
already	1
forgotten	1
calling	1
of	1
knight-adventurers,	1
they	1
may	1
have	1
newly	1
invented	1
other	1
kinds	1
of	1
enchantments	1
and	1
other	1
modes	1
of	1
carrying	1
off	1
the	1
enchanted.	1
What	1
thinkest	1
thou	1
of	1
the	1
matter,	1
Sancho	1
my	1
son?”	1

“I	1
don’t	1
know	1
what	1
to	1
think,”	1
answered	1
Sancho,	1
“not	1
being	1
as	1
well	1
read	1
as	1
your	1
worship	1
in	1
errant	1
writings;	1
but	1
for	1
all	1
that	1
I	1
venture	1
to	1
say	1
and	1
swear	1
that	1
these	1
apparitions	1
that	1
are	1
about	1
us	1
are	1
not	1
quite	1
catholic.”	1
“Catholic!”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote.	1
“Father	1
of	1
me!	1
how	1
can	1
they	1
be	1
Catholic	1
when	1
they	1
are	1
all	1
devils	1
that	1
have	1
taken	1
fantastic	1
shapes	1
to	1
come	1
and	1
do	1
this,	1
and	1
bring	1
me	1
to	1
this	1
condition?	1
And	1
if	1
thou	1
wouldst	1
prove	1
it,	1
touch	1
them,	1
and	1
feel	1
them,	1
and	1
thou	1
wilt	1
find	1
they	1
have	1
only	1
bodies	1
of	1
air,	1
and	1
no	1
consistency	1
except	1
in	1
appearance.”	1
“By	1
God,	1
master,”	1
returned	1
Sancho,	1
“I	1
have	1
touched	1
them	1
already;	1
and	1
that	1
devil,	1
that	1
goes	1
about	1
there	1
so	1
busily,	1
has	1
firm	1
flesh,	1
and	1
another	1
property	1
very	1
different	1
from	1
what	1
I	1
have	1
heard	1
say	1
devils	1
have,	1
for	1
by	1
all	1
accounts	1
they	1
all	1
smell	1
of	1
brimstone	1
and	1
other	1
bad	1
smells;	1
but	1
this	1
one	1
smells	1
of	1
amber	1
half	1
a	1
league	1
off.”	1
Sancho	1
was	1
here	1
speaking	1
of	1
Don	1
Fernando,	1
who,	1
like	1
a	1
gentleman	1
of	1
his	1
rank,	1
was	1
very	1
likely	1
perfumed	1
as	1
Sancho	1
said.	1
“Marvel	1
not	1
at	1
that,	1
Sancho	1
my	1
friend,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
“for	1
let	1
me	1
tell	1
thee	1
devils	1
are	1
crafty;	1
and	1
even	1
if	1
they	1
do	1
carry	1
odours	1
about	1
with	1
them,	1
they	1
themselves	1
have	1
no	1
smell,	1
because	1
they	1
are	1
spirits;	1
or,	1
if	1
they	1
have	1
any	1
smell,	1
they	1
cannot	1
smell	1
of	1
anything	1
sweet,	1
but	1
of	1
something	1
foul	1
and	1
fetid;	1
and	1
the	1
reason	1
is	1
that	1
as	1
they	1
carry	1
hell	1
with	1
them	1
wherever	1
they	1
go,	1
and	1
can	1
get	1
no	1
ease	1
whatever	1
from	1
their	1
torments,	1
and	1
as	1
a	1
sweet	1
smell	1
is	1
a	1
thing	1
that	1
gives	1
pleasure	1
and	1
enjoyment,	1
it	1
is	1
impossible	1
that	1
they	1
can	1
smell	1
sweet;	1
if,	1
then,	1
this	1
devil	1
thou	1
speakest	1
of	1
seems	1
to	1
thee	1
to	1
smell	1
of	1
amber,	1
either	1
thou	1
art	1
deceiving	1
thyself,	1
or	1
he	1
wants	1
to	1
deceive	1
thee	1
by	1
making	1
thee	1
fancy	1
he	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
devil.”	1
Such	1
was	1
the	1
conversation	1
that	1
passed	1
between	1
master	1
and	1
man;	1
and	1
Don	1
Fernando	1
and	1
Cardenio,	1
apprehensive	1
of	1
Sancho’s	1
making	1
a	1
complete	1
discovery	1
of	1
their	1
scheme,	1
towards	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
already	1
gone	1
some	1
way,	1
resolved	1
to	1
hasten	1
their	1
departure,	1
and	1
calling	1
the	1
landlord	1
aside,	1
they	1
directed	1
him	1
to	1
saddle	1
Rocinante	1
and	1
put	1
the	1
pack-saddle	1
on	1
Sancho’s	1
ass,	1
which	1
he	1
did	1
with	1
great	1
alacrity.	1
In	1
the	1
meantime	1
the	1
curate	1
had	1
made	1
an	1
arrangement	1
with	1
the	1
officers	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
bear	1
them	1
company	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
his	1
village,	1
he	1
paying	1
them	1
so	1
much	1
a	1
day.	1
Cardenio	1
hung	1
the	1
buckler	1
on	1
one	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
bow	1
of	1
Rocinante’s	1
saddle	1
and	1
the	1
basin	1
on	1
the	1
other,	1
and	1
by	1
signs	1
commanded	1
Sancho	1
to	1
mount	1
his	1
ass	1
and	1
take	1
Rocinante’s	1
bridle,	1
and	1
at	1
each	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
cart	1
he	1
placed	1
two	1
officers	1
with	1
their	1
muskets;	1
but	1
before	1
the	1
cart	1
was	1
put	1
in	1
motion,	1
out	1
came	1
the	1
landlady	1
and	1
her	1
daughter	1
and	1
Maritornes	1
to	1
bid	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
farewell,	1
pretending	1
to	1
weep	1
with	1
grief	1
at	1
his	1
misfortune;	1
and	1
to	1
them	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
said:	1
“Weep	1
not,	1
good	1
ladies,	1
for	1
all	1
these	1
mishaps	1
are	1
the	1
lot	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
follow	1
the	1
profession	1
I	1
profess;	1
and	1
if	1
these	1
reverses	1
did	1
not	1
befall	1
me	1
I	1
should	1
not	1
esteem	1
myself	1
a	1
famous	1
knight-errant;	1
for	1
such	1
things	1
never	1
happen	1
to	1
knights	1
of	1
little	1
renown	1
and	1
fame,	1
because	1
nobody	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
thinks	1
about	1
them;	1
to	1
valiant	1
knights	1
they	1
do,	1
for	1
these	1
are	1
envied	1
for	1
their	1
virtue	1
and	1
valour	1
by	1
many	1
princes	1
and	1
other	1
knights	1
who	1
compass	1
the	1
destruction	1
of	1
the	1
worthy	1
by	1
base	1
means.	1
Nevertheless,	1
virtue	1
is	1
of	1
herself	1
so	1
mighty,	1
that,	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
magic	1
that	1
Zoroaster	1
its	1
first	1
inventor	1
knew,	1
she	1
will	1
come	1
victorious	1
out	1
of	1
every	1
trial,	1
and	1
shed	1
her	1
light	1
upon	1
the	1
earth	1
as	1
the	1
sun	1
does	1
upon	1
the	1
heavens.	1
Forgive	1
me,	1
fair	1
ladies,	1
if,	1
through	1
inadvertence,	1
I	1
have	1
in	1
aught	1
offended	1
you;	1
for	1
intentionally	1
and	1
wittingly	1
I	1
have	1
never	1
done	1
so	1
to	1
any;	1
and	1
pray	1
to	1
God	1
that	1
he	1
deliver	1
me	1
from	1
this	1
captivity	1
to	1
which	1
some	1
malevolent	1
enchanter	1
has	1
consigned	1
me;	1
and	1
should	1
I	1
find	1
myself	1
released	1
therefrom,	1
the	1
favours	1
that	1
ye	1
have	1
bestowed	1
upon	1
me	1
in	1
this	1
castle	1
shall	1
be	1
held	1
in	1
memory	1
by	1
me,	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
acknowledge,	1
recognise,	1
and	1
requite	1
them	1
as	1
they	1
deserve.”	1
While	1
this	1
was	1
passing	1
between	1
the	1
ladies	1
of	1
the	1
castle	1
and	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
the	1
curate	1
and	1
the	1
barber	1
bade	1
farewell	1
to	1
Don	1
Fernando	1
and	1
his	1
companions,	1
to	1
the	1
captain,	1
his	1
brother,	1
and	1
the	1
ladies,	1
now	1
all	1
made	1
happy,	1
and	1
in	1
particular	1
to	1
Dorothea	1
and	1
Luscinda.	1
They	1
all	1
embraced	1
one	1
another,	1
and	1
promised	1
to	1
let	1
each	1
other	1
know	1
how	1
things	1
went	1
with	1
them,	1
and	1
Don	1
Fernando	1
directed	1
the	1
curate	1
where	1
to	1
write	1
to	1
him,	1
to	1
tell	1
him	1
what	1
became	1
of	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
assuring	1
him	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
nothing	1
that	1
could	1
give	1
him	1
more	1
pleasure	1
than	1
to	1
hear	1
of	1
it,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
too,	1
on	1
his	1
part,	1
would	1
send	1
him	1
word	1
of	1
everything	1
he	1
thought	1
he	1
would	1
like	1
to	1
know,	1
about	1
his	1
marriage,	1
Zoraida’s	1
baptism,	1
Don	1
Luis’s	1
affair,	1
and	1
Luscinda’s	1
return	1
to	1
her	1
home.	1
The	1
curate	1
promised	1
to	1
comply	1
with	1
his	1
request	1
carefully,	1
and	1
they	1
embraced	1
once	1
more,	1
and	1
renewed	1
their	1
promises.	1
The	1
landlord	1
approached	1
the	1
curate	1
and	1
handed	1
him	1
some	1
papers,	1
saying	1
he	1
had	1
discovered	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
lining	1
of	1
the	1
valise	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
novel	1
of	1
“The	1
Ill-advised	1
Curiosity”	1
had	1
been	1
found,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
take	1
them	1
all	1
away	1
with	1
him	1
as	1
their	1
owner	1
had	1
not	1
since	1
returned;	1
for,	1
as	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
read,	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
want	1
them	1
himself.	1
The	1
curate	1
thanked	1
him,	1
and	1
opening	1
them	1
he	1
saw	1
at	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
the	1
manuscript	1
the	1
words,	1
“Novel	1
of	1
Rinconete	1
and	1
Cortadillo,”	1
by	1
which	1
he	1
perceived	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
novel,	1
and	1
as	1
that	1
of	1
“The	1
Ill-advised	1
Curiosity”	1
had	1
been	1
good	1
he	1
concluded	1
this	1
would	1
be	1
so	1
too,	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
both	1
probably	1
by	1
the	1
same	1
author;	1
so	1
he	1
kept	1
it,	1
intending	1
to	1
read	1
it	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
an	1
opportunity.	1
He	1
then	1
mounted	1
and	1
his	1
friend	1
the	1
barber	1
did	1
the	1
same,	1
both	1
masked,	1
so	1
as	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
recognised	1
by	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
and	1
set	1
out	1
following	1
in	1
the	1
rear	1
of	1
the	1
cart.	1
The	1
order	1
of	1
march	1
was	1
this:	1
first	1
went	1
the	1
cart	1
with	1
the	1
owner	1
leading	1
it;	1
at	1
each	1
side	1
of	1
it	1
marched	1
the	1
officers	1
of	1
the	1
Brotherhood,	1
as	1
has	1
been	1
said,	1
with	1
their	1
muskets;	1
then	1
followed	1
Sancho	1
Panza	1
on	1
his	1
ass,	1
leading	1
Rocinante	1
by	1
the	1
bridle;	1
and	1
behind	1
all	1
came	1
the	1
curate	1
and	1
the	1
barber	1
on	1
their	1
mighty	1
mules,	1
with	1
faces	1
covered,	1
as	1
aforesaid,	1
and	1
a	1
grave	1
and	1
serious	1
air,	1
measuring	1
their	1
pace	1
to	1
suit	1
the	1
slow	1
steps	1
of	1
the	1
oxen.	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
was	1
seated	1
in	1
the	1
cage,	1
with	1
his	1
hands	1
tied	1
and	1
his	1
feet	1
stretched	1
out,	1
leaning	1
against	1
the	1
bars	1
as	1
silent	1
and	1
as	1
patient	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
were	1
a	1
stone	1
statue	1
and	1
not	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
flesh.	1
Thus	1
slowly	1
and	1
silently	1
they	1
made,	1
it	1
might	1
be,	1
two	1
leagues,	1
until	1
they	1
reached	1
a	1
valley	1
which	1
the	1
carter	1
thought	1
a	1
convenient	1
place	1
for	1
resting	1
and	1
feeding	1
his	1
oxen,	1
and	1
he	1
said	1
so	1
to	1
the	1
curate,	1
but	1
the	1
barber	1
was	1
of	1
opinion	1
that	1
they	1
ought	1
to	1
push	1
on	1
a	1
little	1
farther,	1
as	1
at	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
of	1
a	1
hill	1
which	1
appeared	1
close	1
by	1
he	1
knew	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
valley	1
that	1
had	1
more	1
grass	1
and	1
much	1
better	1
than	1
the	1
one	1
where	1
they	1
proposed	1
to	1
halt;	1
and	1
his	1
advice	1
was	1
taken	1
and	1
they	1
continued	1
their	1
journey.	1
Just	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
the	1
curate,	1
looking	1
back,	1
saw	1
coming	1
on	1
behind	1
them	1
six	1
or	1
seven	1
mounted	1
men,	1
well	1
found	1
and	1
equipped,	1
who	1
soon	1
overtook	1
them,	1
for	1
they	1
were	1
travelling,	1
not	1
at	1
the	1
sluggish,	1
deliberate	1
pace	1
of	1
oxen,	1
but	1
like	1
men	1
who	1
rode	1
canons’	1
mules,	1
and	1
in	1
haste	1
to	1
take	1
their	1
noontide	1
rest	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
possible	1
at	1
the	1
inn	1
which	1
was	1
in	1
sight	1
not	1
a	1
league	1
off.	1
The	1
quick	1
travellers	1
came	1
up	1
with	1
the	1
slow,	1
and	1
courteous	1
salutations	1
were	1
exchanged;	1
and	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
new	1
comers,	1
who	1
was,	1
in	1
fact,	1
a	1
canon	1
of	1
Toledo	1
and	1
master	1
of	1
the	1
others	1
who	1
accompanied	1
him,	1
observing	1
the	1
regular	1
order	1
of	1
the	1
procession,	1
the	1
cart,	1
the	1
officers,	1
Sancho,	1
Rocinante,	1
the	1
curate	1
and	1
the	1
barber,	1
and	1
above	1
all	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
caged	1
and	1
confined,	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
asking	1
what	1
was	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
carrying	1
the	1
man	1
in	1
that	1
fashion;	1
though,	1
from	1
the	1
badges	1
of	1
the	1
officers,	1
he	1
already	1
concluded	1
that	1
he	1
must	1
be	1
some	1
desperate	1
highwayman	1
or	1
other	1
malefactor	1
whose	1
punishment	1
fell	1
within	1
the	1
jurisdiction	1
of	1
the	1
Holy	1
Brotherhood.	1
One	1
of	1
the	1
officers	1
to	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
put	1
the	1
question,	1
replied,	1
“Let	1
the	1
gentleman	1
himself	1
tell	1
you	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
his	1
going	1
this	1
way,	1
señor,	1
for	1
we	1
do	1
not	1
know.”	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
overheard	1
the	1
conversation	1
and	1
said,	1
“Haply,	1
gentlemen,	1
you	1
are	1
versed	1
and	1
learned	1
in	1
matters	1
of	1
errant	1
chivalry?	1
Because	1
if	1
you	1
are	1
I	1
will	1
tell	1
you	1
my	1
misfortunes;	1
if	1
not,	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
good	1
in	1
my	1
giving	1
myself	1
the	1
trouble	1
of	1
relating	1
them;”	1
but	1
here	1
the	1
curate	1
and	1
the	1
barber,	1
seeing	1
that	1
the	1
travellers	1
were	1
engaged	1
in	1
conversation	1
with	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
came	1
forward,	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
answer	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
way	1
as	1
to	1
save	1
their	1
stratagem	1
from	1
being	1
discovered.	1
The	1
canon,	1
replying	1
to	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
said,	1
“In	1
truth,	1
brother,	1
I	1
know	1
more	1
about	1
books	1
of	1
chivalry	1
than	1
I	1
do	1
about	1
Villalpando’s	1
elements	1
of	1
logic;	1
so	1
if	1
that	1
be	1
all,	1
you	1
may	1
safely	1
tell	1
me	1
what	1
you	1
please.”	1
“In	1
God’s	1
name,	1
then,	1
señor,”	1
replied	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
“if	1
that	1
be	1
so,	1
I	1
would	1
have	1
you	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
held	1
enchanted	1
in	1
this	1
cage	1
by	1
the	1
envy	1
and	1
fraud	1
of	1
wicked	1
enchanters;	1
for	1
virtue	1
is	1
more	1
persecuted	1
by	1
the	1
wicked	1
than	1
loved	1
by	1
the	1
good.	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
knight-errant,	1
and	1
not	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
whose	1
names	1
Fame	1
has	1
never	1
thought	1
of	1
immortalising	1
in	1
her	1
record,	1
but	1
of	1
those	1
who,	1
in	1
defiance	1
and	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
envy	1
itself,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
magicians	1
that	1
Persia,	1
or	1
Brahmans	1
that	1
India,	1
or	1
Gymnosophists	1
that	1
Ethiopia	1
ever	1
produced,	1
will	1
place	1
their	1
names	1
in	1
the	1
temple	1
of	1
immortality,	1
to	1
serve	1
as	1
examples	1
and	1
patterns	1
for	1
ages	1
to	1
come,	1
whereby	1
knights-errant	1
may	1
see	1
the	1
footsteps	1
in	1
which	1
they	1
must	1
tread	1
if	1
they	1
would	1
attain	1
the	1
summit	1
and	1
crowning	1
point	1
of	1
honour	1
in	1
arms.”	1
“What	1
Señor	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
of	1
La	1
Mancha	1
says,”	1
observed	1
the	1
curate,	1
“is	1
the	1
truth;	1
for	1
he	1
goes	1
enchanted	1
in	1
this	1
cart,	1
not	1
from	1
any	1
fault	1
or	1
sins	1
of	1
his,	1
but	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
malevolence	1
of	1
those	1
to	1
whom	1
virtue	1
is	1
odious	1
and	1
valour	1
hateful.	1
This,	1
señor,	1
is	1
the	1
Knight	1
of	1
the	1
Rueful	1
Countenance,	1
if	1
you	1
have	1
ever	1
heard	1
him	1
named,	1
whose	1
valiant	1
achievements	1
and	1
mighty	1
deeds	1
shall	1
be	1
written	1
on	1
lasting	1
brass	1
and	1
imperishable	1
marble,	1
notwithstanding	1
all	1
the	1
efforts	1
of	1
envy	1
to	1
obscure	1
them	1
and	1
malice	1
to	1
hide	1
them.”	1
When	1
the	1
canon	1
heard	1
both	1
the	1
prisoner	1
and	1
the	1
man	1
who	1
was	1
at	1
liberty	1
talk	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
strain	1
he	1
was	1
ready	1
to	1
cross	1
himself	1
in	1
his	1
astonishment,	1
and	1
could	1
not	1
make	1
out	1
what	1
had	1
befallen	1
him;	1
and	1
all	1
his	1
attendants	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
state	1
of	1
amazement.	1
At	1
this	1
point	1
Sancho	1
Panza,	1
who	1
had	1
drawn	1
near	1
to	1
hear	1
the	1
conversation,	1
said,	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
make	1
everything	1
plain,	1
“Well,	1
sirs,	1
you	1
may	1
like	1
or	1
dislike	1
what	1
I	1
am	1
going	1
to	1
say,	1
but	1
the	1
fact	1
of	1
the	1
matter	1
is,	1
my	1
master,	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
is	1
just	1
as	1
much	1
enchanted	1
as	1
my	1
mother.	1
He	1
is	1
in	1
his	1
full	1
senses,	1
he	1
eats	1
and	1
he	1
drinks,	1
and	1
he	1
has	1
his	1
calls	1
like	1
other	1
men	1
and	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
yesterday,	1
before	1
they	1
caged	1
him.	1
And	1
if	1
that’s	1
the	1
case,	1
what	1
do	1
they	1
mean	1
by	1
wanting	1
me	1
to	1
believe	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
enchanted?	1
For	1
I	1
have	1
heard	1
many	1
a	1
one	1
say	1
that	1
enchanted	1
people	1
neither	1
eat,	1
nor	1
sleep,	1
nor	1
talk;	1
and	1
my	1
master,	1
if	1
you	1
don’t	1
stop	1
him,	1
will	1
talk	1
more	1
than	1
thirty	1
lawyers.”	1
Then	1
turning	1
to	1
the	1
curate	1
he	1
exclaimed,	1
“Ah,	1
señor	1
curate,	1
señor	1
curate!	1
do	1
you	1
think	1
I	1
don’t	1
know	1
you?	1
Do	1
you	1
think	1
I	1
don’t	1
guess	1
and	1
see	1
the	1
drift	1
of	1
these	1
new	1
enchantments?	1
Well	1
then,	1
I	1
can	1
tell	1
you	1
I	1
know	1
you,	1
for	1
all	1
your	1
face	1
is	1
covered,	1
and	1
I	1
can	1
tell	1
you	1
I	1
am	1
up	1
to	1
you,	1
however	1
you	1
may	1
hide	1
your	1
tricks.	1
After	1
all,	1
where	1
envy	1
reigns	1
virtue	1
cannot	1
live,	1
and	1
where	1
there	1
is	1
niggardliness	1
there	1
can	1
be	1
no	1
liberality.	1
Ill	1
betide	1
the	1
devil!	1
if	1
it	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
for	1
your	1
worship	1
my	1
master	1
would	1
be	1
married	1
to	1
the	1
Princess	1
Micomicona	1
this	1
minute,	1
and	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
a	1
count	1
at	1
least;	1
for	1
no	1
less	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
expected,	1
as	1
well	1
from	1
the	1
goodness	1
of	1
my	1
master,	1
him	1
of	1
the	1
Rueful	1
Countenance,	1
as	1
from	1
the	1
greatness	1
of	1
my	1
services.	1
But	1
I	1
see	1
now	1
how	1
true	1
it	1
is	1
what	1
they	1
say	1
in	1
these	1
parts,	1
that	1
the	1
wheel	1
of	1
fortune	1
turns	1
faster	1
than	1
a	1
mill-wheel,	1
and	1
that	1
those	1
who	1
were	1
up	1
yesterday	1
are	1
down	1
to-day.	1
I	1
am	1
sorry	1
for	1
my	1
wife	1
and	1
children,	1
for	1
when	1
they	1
might	1
fairly	1
and	1
reasonably	1
expect	1
to	1
see	1
their	1
father	1
return	1
to	1
them	1
a	1
governor	1
or	1
viceroy	1
of	1
some	1
island	1
or	1
kingdom,	1
they	1
will	1
see	1
him	1
come	1
back	1
a	1
horse-boy.	1
I	1
have	1
said	1
all	1
this,	1
señor	1
curate,	1
only	1
to	1
urge	1
your	1
paternity	1
to	1
lay	1
to	1
your	1
conscience	1
your	1
ill-treatment	1
of	1
my	1
master;	1
and	1
have	1
a	1
care	1
that	1
God	1
does	1
not	1
call	1
you	1
to	1
account	1
in	1
another	1
life	1
for	1
making	1
a	1
prisoner	1
of	1
him	1
in	1
this	1
way,	1
and	1
charge	1
against	1
you	1
all	1
the	1
succours	1
and	1
good	1
deeds	1
that	1
my	1
lord	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
leaves	1
undone	1
while	1
he	1
is	1
shut	1
up.	1
“Trim	1
those	1
lamps	1
there!”	1
exclaimed	1
the	1
barber	1
at	1
this;	1
“so	1
you	1
are	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
fraternity	1
as	1
your	1
master,	1
too,	1
Sancho?	1
By	1
God,	1
I	1
begin	1
to	1
see	1
that	1
you	1
will	1
have	1
to	1
keep	1
him	1
company	1
in	1
the	1
cage,	1
and	1
be	1
enchanted	1
like	1
him	1
for	1
having	1
caught	1
some	1
of	1
his	1
humour	1
and	1
chivalry.	1
It	1
was	1
an	1
evil	1
hour	1
when	1
you	1
let	1
yourself	1
be	1
got	1
with	1
child	1
by	1
his	1
promises,	1
and	1
that	1
island	1
you	1
long	1
so	1
much	1
for	1
found	1
its	1
way	1
into	1
your	1
head.”	1
“I	1
am	1
not	1
with	1
child	1
by	1
anyone,”	1
returned	1
Sancho,	1
“nor	1
am	1
I	1
a	1
man	1
to	1
let	1
myself	1
be	1
got	1
with	1
child,	1
if	1
it	1
was	1
by	1
the	1
King	1
himself.	1
Though	1
I	1
am	1
poor	1
I	1
am	1
an	1
old	1
Christian,	1
and	1
I	1
owe	1
nothing	1
to	1
nobody,	1
and	1
if	1
I	1
long	1
for	1
an	1
island,	1
other	1
people	1
long	1
for	1
worse.	1
Each	1
of	1
us	1
is	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
works;	1
and	1
being	1
a	1
man	1
I	1
may	1
come	1
to	1
be	1
pope,	1
not	1
to	1
say	1
governor	1
of	1
an	1
island,	1
especially	1
as	1
my	1
master	1
may	1
win	1
so	1
many	1
that	1
he	1
will	1
not	1
know	1
whom	1
to	1
give	1
them	1
to.	1
Mind	1
how	1
you	1
talk,	1
master	1
barber;	1
for	1
shaving	1
is	1
not	1
everything,	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
some	1
difference	1
between	1
Peter	1
and	1
Peter.	1
I	1
say	1
this	1
because	1
we	1
all	1
know	1
one	1
another,	1
and	1
it	1
will	1
not	1
do	1
to	1
throw	1
false	1
dice	1
with	1
me;	1
and	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
enchantment	1
of	1
my	1
master,	1
God	1
knows	1
the	1
truth;	1
leave	1
it	1
as	1
it	1
is;	1
it	1
only	1
makes	1
it	1
worse	1
to	1
stir	1
it.”	1
The	1
barber	1
did	1
not	1
care	1
to	1
answer	1
Sancho	1
lest	1
by	1
his	1
plain	1
speaking	1
he	1
should	1
disclose	1
what	1
the	1
curate	1
and	1
he	1
himself	1
were	1
trying	1
so	1
hard	1
to	1
conceal;	1
and	1
under	1
the	1
same	1
apprehension	1
the	1
curate	1
had	1
asked	1
the	1
canon	1
to	1
ride	1
on	1
a	1
little	1
in	1
advance,	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
tell	1
him	1
the	1
mystery	1
of	1
this	1
man	1
in	1
the	1
cage,	1
and	1
other	1
things	1
that	1
would	1
amuse	1
him.	1
The	1
canon	1
agreed,	1
and	1
going	1
on	1
ahead	1
with	1
his	1
servants,	1
listened	1
with	1
attention	1
to	1
the	1
account	1
of	1
the	1
character,	1
life,	1
madness,	1
and	1
ways	1
of	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
given	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
curate,	1
who	1
described	1
to	1
him	1
briefly	1
the	1
beginning	1
and	1
origin	1
of	1
his	1
craze,	1
and	1
told	1
him	1
the	1
whole	1
story	1
of	1
his	1
adventures	1
up	1
to	1
his	1
being	1
confined	1
in	1
the	1
cage,	1
together	1
with	1
the	1
plan	1
they	1
had	1
of	1
taking	1
him	1
home	1
to	1
try	1
if	1
by	1
any	1
means	1
they	1
could	1
discover	1
a	1
cure	1
for	1
his	1
madness.	1
The	1
canon	1
and	1
his	1
servants	1
were	1
surprised	1
anew	1
when	1
they	1
heard	1
Don	1
Quixote’s	1
strange	1
story,	1
and	1
when	1
it	1
was	1
finished	1
he	1
said,	1
“To	1
tell	1
the	1
truth,	1
señor	1
curate,	1
I	1
for	1
my	1
part	1
consider	1
what	1
they	1
call	1
books	1
of	1
chivalry	1
to	1
be	1
mischievous	1
to	1
the	1
State;	1
and	1
though,	1
led	1
by	1
idle	1
and	1
false	1
taste,	1
I	1
have	1
read	1
the	1
beginnings	1
of	1
almost	1
all	1
that	1
have	1
been	1
printed,	1
I	1
never	1
could	1
manage	1
to	1
read	1
any	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
from	1
beginning	1
to	1
end;	1
for	1
it	1
seems	1
to	1
me	1
they	1
are	1
all	1
more	1
or	1
less	1
the	1
same	1
thing;	1
and	1
one	1
has	1
nothing	1
more	1
in	1
it	1
than	1
another;	1
this	1
no	1
more	1
than	1
that.	1
And	1
in	1
my	1
opinion	1
this	1
sort	1
of	1
writing	1
and	1
composition	1
is	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
species	1
as	1
the	1
fables	1
they	1
call	1
the	1
Milesian,	1
nonsensical	1
tales	1
that	1
aim	1
solely	1
at	1
giving	1
amusement	1
and	1
not	1
instruction,	1
exactly	1
the	1
opposite	1
of	1
the	1
apologue	1
fables	1
which	1
amuse	1
and	1
instruct	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time.	1
And	1
though	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
the	1
chief	1
object	1
of	1
such	1
books	1
to	1
amuse,	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
how	1
they	1
can	1
succeed,	1
when	1
they	1
are	1
so	1
full	1
of	1
such	1
monstrous	1
nonsense.	1
For	1
the	1
enjoyment	1
the	1
mind	1
feels	1
must	1
come	1
from	1
the	1
beauty	1
and	1
harmony	1
which	1
it	1
perceives	1
or	1
contemplates	1
in	1
the	1
things	1
that	1
the	1
eye	1
or	1
the	1
imagination	1
brings	1
before	1
it;	1
and	1
nothing	1
that	1
has	1
any	1
ugliness	1
or	1
disproportion	1
about	1
it	1
can	1
give	1
any	1
pleasure.	1
What	1
beauty,	1
then,	1
or	1
what	1
proportion	1
of	1
the	1
parts	1
to	1
the	1
whole,	1
or	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
to	1
the	1
parts,	1
can	1
there	1
be	1
in	1
a	1
book	1
or	1
fable	1
where	1
a	1
lad	1
of	1
sixteen	1
cuts	1
down	1
a	1
giant	1
as	1
tall	1
as	1
a	1
tower	1
and	1
makes	1
two	1
halves	1
of	1
him	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
was	1
an	1
almond	1
cake?	1
And	1
when	1
they	1
want	1
to	1
give	1
us	1
a	1
picture	1
of	1
a	1
battle,	1
after	1
having	1
told	1
us	1
that	1
there	1
are	1
a	1
million	1
of	1
combatants	1
on	1
the	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
enemy,	1
let	1
the	1
hero	1
of	1
the	1
book	1
be	1
opposed	1
to	1
them,	1
and	1
we	1
have	1
perforce	1
to	1
believe,	1
whether	1
we	1
like	1
it	1
or	1
not,	1
that	1
the	1
said	1
knight	1
wins	1
the	1
victory	1
by	1
the	1
single	1
might	1
of	1
his	1
strong	1
arm.	1
And	1
then,	1
what	1
shall	1
we	1
say	1
of	1
the	1
facility	1
with	1
which	1
a	1
born	1
queen	1
or	1
empress	1
will	1
give	1
herself	1
over	1
into	1
the	1
arms	1
of	1
some	1
unknown	1
wandering	1
knight?	1
What	1
mind,	1
that	1
is	1
not	1
wholly	1
barbarous	1
and	1
uncultured,	1
can	1
find	1
pleasure	1
in	1
reading	1
of	1
how	1
a	1
great	1
tower	1
full	1
of	1
knights	1
sails	1
away	1
across	1
the	1
sea	1
like	1
a	1
ship	1
with	1
a	1
fair	1
wind,	1
and	1
will	1
be	1
to-night	1
in	1
Lombardy	1
and	1
to-morrow	1
morning	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
Prester	1
John	1
of	1
the	1
Indies,	1
or	1
some	1
other	1
that	1
Ptolemy	1
never	1
described	1
nor	1
Marco	1
Polo	1
saw?	1
And	1
if,	1
in	1
answer	1
to	1
this,	1
I	1
am	1
told	1
that	1
the	1
authors	1
of	1
books	1
of	1
the	1
kind	1
write	1
them	1
as	1
fiction,	1
and	1
therefore	1
are	1
not	1
bound	1
to	1
regard	1
niceties	1
of	1
truth,	1
I	1
would	1
reply	1
that	1
fiction	1
is	1
all	1
the	1
better	1
the	1
more	1
it	1
looks	1
like	1
truth,	1
and	1
gives	1
the	1
more	1
pleasure	1
the	1
more	1
probability	1
and	1
possibility	1
there	1
is	1
about	1
it.	1
Plots	1
in	1
fiction	1
should	1
be	1
wedded	1
to	1
the	1
understanding	1
of	1
the	1
reader,	1
and	1
be	1
constructed	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
way	1
that,	1
reconciling	1
impossibilities,	1
smoothing	1
over	1
difficulties,	1
keeping	1
the	1
mind	1
on	1
the	1
alert,	1
they	1
may	1
surprise,	1
interest,	1
divert,	1
and	1
entertain,	1
so	1
that	1
wonder	1
and	1
delight	1
joined	1
may	1
keep	1
pace	1
one	1
with	1
the	1
other;	1
all	1
which	1
he	1
will	1
fail	1
to	1
effect	1
who	1
shuns	1
verisimilitude	1
and	1
truth	1
to	1
nature,	1
wherein	1
lies	1
the	1
perfection	1
of	1
writing.	1
I	1
have	1
never	1
yet	1
seen	1
any	1
book	1
of	1
chivalry	1
that	1
puts	1
together	1
a	1
connected	1
plot	1
complete	1
in	1
all	1
its	1
numbers,	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
middle	1
agrees	1
with	1
the	1
beginning,	1
and	1
the	1
end	1
with	1
the	1
beginning	1
and	1
middle;	1
on	1
the	1
contrary,	1
they	1
construct	1
them	1
with	1
such	1
a	1
multitude	1
of	1
members	1
that	1
it	1
seems	1
as	1
though	1
they	1
meant	1
to	1
produce	1
a	1
chimera	1
or	1
monster	1
rather	1
than	1
a	1
well-proportioned	1
figure.	1
And	1
besides	1
all	1
this	1
they	1
are	1
harsh	1
in	1
their	1
style,	1
incredible	1
in	1
their	1
achievements,	1
licentious	1
in	1
their	1
amours,	1
uncouth	1
in	1
their	1
courtly	1
speeches,	1
prolix	1
in	1
their	1
battles,	1
silly	1
in	1
their	1
arguments,	1
absurd	1
in	1
their	1
travels,	1
and,	1
in	1
short,	1
wanting	1
in	1
everything	1
like	1
intelligent	1
art;	1
for	1
which	1
reason	1
they	1
deserve	1
to	1
be	1
banished	1
from	1
the	1
Christian	1
commonwealth	1
as	1
a	1
worthless	1
breed.”	1

The	1
curate	1
listened	1
to	1
him	1
attentively	1
and	1
felt	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
sound	1
understanding,	1
and	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
good	1
reason	1
in	1
what	1
he	1
said;	1
so	1
he	1
told	1
him	1
that,	1
being	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
opinion	1
himself,	1
and	1
bearing	1
a	1
grudge	1
to	1
books	1
of	1
chivalry,	1
he	1
had	1
burned	1
all	1
Don	1
Quixote’s,	1
which	1
were	1
many;	1
and	1
gave	1
him	1
an	1
account	1
of	1
the	1
scrutiny	1
he	1
had	1
made	1
of	1
them,	1
and	1
of	1
those	1
he	1
had	1
condemned	1
to	1
the	1
flames	1
and	1
those	1
he	1
had	1
spared,	1
with	1
which	1
the	1
canon	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
little	1
amused,	1
adding	1
that	1
though	1
he	1
had	1
said	1
so	1
much	1
in	1
condemnation	1
of	1
these	1
books,	1
still	1
he	1
found	1
one	1
good	1
thing	1
in	1
them,	1
and	1
that	1
was	1
the	1
opportunity	1
they	1
afforded	1
to	1
a	1
gifted	1
intellect	1
for	1
displaying	1
itself;	1
for	1
they	1
presented	1
a	1
wide	1
and	1
spacious	1
field	1
over	1
which	1
the	1
pen	1
might	1
range	1
freely,	1
describing	1
shipwrecks,	1
tempests,	1
combats,	1
battles,	1
portraying	1
a	1
valiant	1
captain	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
qualifications	1
requisite	1
to	1
make	1
one,	1
showing	1
him	1
sagacious	1
in	1
foreseeing	1
the	1
wiles	1
of	1
the	1
enemy,	1
eloquent	1
in	1
speech	1
to	1
encourage	1
or	1
restrain	1
his	1
soldiers,	1
ripe	1
in	1
counsel,	1
rapid	1
in	1
resolve,	1
as	1
bold	1
in	1
biding	1
his	1
time	1
as	1
in	1
pressing	1
the	1
attack;	1
now	1
picturing	1
some	1
sad	1
tragic	1
incident,	1
now	1
some	1
joyful	1
and	1
unexpected	1
event;	1
here	1
a	1
beauteous	1
lady,	1
virtuous,	1
wise,	1
and	1
modest;	1
there	1
a	1
Christian	1
knight,	1
brave	1
and	1
gentle;	1
here	1
a	1
lawless,	1
barbarous	1
braggart;	1
there	1
a	1
courteous	1
prince,	1
gallant	1
and	1
gracious;	1
setting	1
forth	1
the	1
devotion	1
and	1
loyalty	1
of	1
vassals,	1
the	1
greatness	1
and	1
generosity	1
of	1
nobles.	1
“Or	1
again,”	1
said	1
he,	1
“the	1
author	1
may	1
show	1
himself	1
to	1
be	1
an	1
astronomer,	1

a	1
skilled	1

musician,	1
or	1
one	1
versed	1
in	1
affairs	1

sometimes	1
he	1
will	1
have	1
a	1
chance	1
of	1
coming	1
forward	1
as	1
a	1
magician	1
if	1
he	1
likes.	1
He	1
can	1
set	1
forth	1
the	1
craftiness	1
of	1
Ulysses,	1
the	1

“It	1
is	1
as	1
you	1
say,	1
señor	1
canon,”	1
said	1
the	1
curate;	1
“and	1
for	1
that	1
reason	1
those	1
who	1
have	1
hitherto	1
written	1
books	1
of	1
the	1
sort	1
deserve	1
all	1
the	1
more	1
censure	1
for	1
writing	1
without	1
paying	1
any	1
attention	1
to	1
good	1
taste	1
or	1
the	1
rules	1
of	1
art,	1
by	1
which	1
they	1
might	1
guide	1
themselves	1
and	1
become	1
as	1
famous	1
in	1
prose	1
as	1
the	1
two	1
princes	1
of	1
Greek	1
and	1
Latin	1
poetry	1
are	1
in	1
verse.”	1
“I	1
myself,	1
at	1
any	1
rate,”	1
said	1
the	1
canon,	1
“was	1
once	1
tempted	1
to	1
write	1
a	1
book	1
of	1
chivalry	1
in	1
which	1
all	1
the	1
points	1
I	1
have	1
mentioned	1
were	1
to	1
be	1
observed;	1
and	1
if	1
I	1
must	1
own	1
the	1
truth	1
I	1
have	1
more	1
than	1
a	1
hundred	1
sheets	1
written;	1
and	1
to	1
try	1
if	1
it	1
came	1
up	1
to	1
my	1
own	1
opinion	1
of	1
it,	1
I	1
showed	1
them	1
to	1
persons	1
who	1
were	1
fond	1
of	1
this	1
kind	1
of	1
reading,	1
to	1
learned	1
and	1
intelligent	1
men	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
to	1
ignorant	1
people	1
who	1
cared	1
for	1
nothing	1
but	1
the	1
pleasure	1
of	1
listening	1
to	1
nonsense,	1
and	1
from	1
all	1
I	1
obtained	1
flattering	1
approval;	1
nevertheless	1
I	1
proceeded	1
no	1
farther	1
with	1
it,	1
as	1
well	1
because	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
me	1
an	1
occupation	1
inconsistent	1
with	1
my	1
profession,	1
as	1
because	1
I	1
perceived	1
that	1
the	1
fools	1
are	1
more	1
numerous	1
than	1
the	1
wise;	1
and,	1
though	1
it	1
is	1
better	1
to	1
be	1
praised	1
by	1
the	1
wise	1
few	1
than	1
applauded	1
by	1
the	1
foolish	1
many,	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
mind	1
to	1
submit	1
myself	1
to	1
the	1
stupid	1
judgment	1
of	1
the	1
silly	1
public,	1
to	1
whom	1
the	1
reading	1
of	1
such	1
books	1
falls	1
for	1
the	1
most	1
part.	1
“But	1
what	1
most	1
of	1
all	1
made	1
me	1
hold	1
my	1
hand	1
and	1
even	1
abandon	1
all	1
idea	1
of	1
finishing	1
it	1
was	1
an	1
argument	1
I	1
put	1
to	1
myself	1
taken	1
from	1
the	1
plays	1
that	1
are	1
acted	1
now-a-days,	1
which	1
was	1
in	1
this	1
wise:	1
if	1
those	1
that	1
are	1
now	1
in	1
vogue,	1
as	1
well	1
those	1
that	1
are	1
pure	1
invention	1
as	1
those	1
founded	1
on	1
history,	1
are,	1
all	1
or	1
most	1
of	1
them,	1
downright	1
nonsense	1
and	1
things	1
that	1
have	1
neither	1
head	1
nor	1
tail,	1
and	1
yet	1
the	1
public	1
listens	1
to	1
them	1
with	1
delight,	1
and	1
regards	1
and	1
cries	1
them	1
up	1
as	1
perfection	1
when	1
they	1
are	1
so	1
far	1
from	1
it;	1
and	1
if	1
the	1
authors	1
who	1
write	1
them,	1
and	1
the	1
players	1
who	1
act	1
them,	1
say	1
that	1
this	1
is	1
what	1
they	1
must	1
be,	1
for	1
the	1
public	1
wants	1
this	1
and	1
will	1
have	1
nothing	1
else;	1
and	1
that	1
those	1
that	1
go	1
by	1
rule	1
and	1
work	1
out	1
a	1
plot	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
laws	1
of	1
art	1
will	1
only	1
find	1
some	1
half-dozen	1
intelligent	1
people	1
to	1
understand	1
them,	1
while	1
all	1
the	1
rest	1
remain	1
blind	1
to	1
the	1
merit	1
of	1
their	1
composition;	1
and	1
that	1
for	1
themselves	1
it	1
is	1
better	1
to	1
get	1
bread	1
from	1
the	1
many	1
than	1
praise	1
from	1
the	1
few;	1
then	1
my	1
book	1
will	1
fare	1
the	1
same	1
way,	1
after	1
I	1
have	1
burnt	1
off	1
my	1
eyebrows	1
in	1
trying	1
to	1
observe	1
the	1
principles	1
I	1
have	1
spoken	1
of,	1
and	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
‘the	1
tailor	1
of	1
the	1
corner.’	1
And	1
though	1
I	1
have	1
sometimes	1
endeavoured	1
to	1
convince	1
actors	1
that	1
they	1
are	1
mistaken	1
in	1
this	1
notion	1
they	1
have	1
adopted,	1
and	1
that	1
they	1
would	1
attract	1
more	1
people,	1
and	1
get	1
more	1
credit,	1
by	1
producing	1
plays	1
in	1
accordance	1
with	1
the	1
rules	1
of	1
art,	1
than	1
by	1
absurd	1
ones,	1
they	1
are	1
so	1
thoroughly	1
wedded	1
to	1
their	1
own	1
opinion	1
that	1
no	1
argument	1
or	1
evidence	1
can	1
wean	1
them	1
from	1
it.	1
“I	1
remember	1
saying	1
one	1
day	1
to	1
one	1
of	1
these	1
obstinate	1
fellows,	1
‘Tell	1
me,	1
do	1
you	1
not	1
recollect	1
that	1
a	1
few	1
years	1
ago,	1
there	1
were	1
three	1
tragedies	1
acted	1
in	1
Spain,	1
written	1
by	1
a	1
famous	1
poet	1
of	1
these	1
kingdoms,	1
which	1
were	1
such	1
that	1
they	1
filled	1
all	1
who	1
heard	1
them	1
with	1
admiration,	1
delight,	1
and	1
interest,	1
the	1
ignorant	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
the	1
wise,	1
the	1
masses	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
the	1
higher	1
orders,	1
and	1
brought	1
in	1
more	1
money	1
to	1
the	1
performers,	1
these	1
three	1
alone,	1
than	1
thirty	1
of	1
the	1
best	1
that	1
have	1
been	1
since	1
produced?’	1
“‘No	1
doubt,’	1
replied	1
the	1
actor	1
in	1
question,	1
‘you	1
mean	1
the	1
“Isabella,”	1
the	1
“Phyllis,”	1
and	1
the	1
“Alexandra.”’	1
“‘Those	1
are	1
the	1
ones	1
I	1
mean,’	1
said	1
I;	1
‘and	1
see	1
if	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
observe	1
the	1
principles	1
of	1
art,	1
and	1
if,	1
by	1
observing	1
them,	1
they	1
failed	1
to	1
show	1
their	1
superiority	1
and	1
please	1
all	1
the	1
world;	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
fault	1
does	1
not	1
lie	1
with	1
the	1
public	1
that	1
insists	1
upon	1
nonsense,	1
but	1
with	1
those	1
who	1
don’t	1
know	1
how	1
to	1
produce	1
something	1
else.	1
“The	1
Ingratitude	1
Revenged”	1
was	1
not	1
nonsense,	1
nor	1
was	1
there	1
any	1
in	1
“The	1
Numantia,”	1
nor	1
any	1
to	1
be	1
found	1
in	1
“The	1
Merchant	1
Lover,”	1
nor	1
yet	1
in	1
“The	1
Friendly	1
Fair	1
Foe,”	1
nor	1
in	1
some	1
others	1
that	1
have	1
been	1
written	1
by	1
certain	1
gifted	1
poets,	1
to	1
their	1
own	1
fame	1
and	1
renown,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
profit	1
of	1
those	1
that	1
brought	1
them	1
out;’	1
some	1
further	1
remarks	1
I	1
added	1
to	1
these,	1
with	1
which,	1
I	1
think,	1
I	1
left	1
him	1
rather	1
dumbfoundered,	1
but	1
not	1
so	1
satisfied	1
or	1
convinced	1
that	1
I	1
could	1
disabuse	1
him	1
of	1
his	1
error.”	1
“You	1
have	1
touched	1
upon	1
a	1
subject,	1
señor	1
canon,”	1
observed	1
the	1
curate	1
here,	1
“that	1
has	1
awakened	1
an	1
old	1
enmity	1
I	1
have	1
against	1
the	1
plays	1
in	1
vogue	1
at	1
the	1
present	1
day,	1
quite	1
as	1
strong	1
as	1
that	1
which	1
I	1
bear	1
to	1
the	1
books	1
of	1
chivalry;	1
for	1
while	1
the	1
drama,	1
according	1
to	1
Tully,	1
should	1
be	1
the	1
mirror	1
of	1
human	1
life,	1
the	1
model	1
of	1
manners,	1
and	1
the	1
image	1
of	1
the	1
truth,	1
those	1
which	1
are	1
presented	1
now-a-days	1
are	1
mirrors	1
of	1
nonsense,	1
models	1
of	1
folly,	1
and	1
images	1
of	1
lewdness.	1
For	1
what	1
greater	1
nonsense	1
can	1
there	1
be	1
in	1
connection	1
with	1
what	1
we	1
are	1
now	1
discussing	1
than	1
for	1
an	1
infant	1
to	1
appear	1
in	1
swaddling	1
clothes	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
scene	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
act,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
second	1
a	1
grown-up	1
bearded	1
man?	1
Or	1
what	1
greater	1
absurdity	1
can	1
there	1
be	1
than	1
putting	1
before	1
us	1
an	1
old	1
man	1
as	1
a	1
swashbuckler,	1
a	1
young	1
man	1
as	1
a	1
poltroon,	1
a	1
lackey	1
using	1
fine	1
language,	1
a	1
page	1
giving	1
sage	1
advice,	1
a	1
king	1
plying	1
as	1
a	1
porter,	1
a	1
princess	1
who	1
is	1
a	1
kitchen-maid?	1
And	1
then	1
what	1
shall	1
I	1
say	1
of	1
their	1
attention	1
to	1
the	1
time	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
action	1
they	1
represent	1
may	1
or	1
can	1
take	1
place,	1
save	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
seen	1
a	1
play	1
where	1
the	1
first	1
act	1
began	1
in	1
Europe,	1
the	1
second	1
in	1
Asia,	1
the	1
third	1
finished	1
in	1
Africa,	1
and	1
no	1
doubt,	1
had	1
it	1
been	1
in	1
four	1
acts,	1
the	1
fourth	1
would	1
have	1
ended	1
in	1
America,	1
and	1
so	1
it	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
laid	1
in	1
all	1
four	1
quarters	1
of	1
the	1
globe?	1
And	1
if	1
truth	1
to	1
life	1
is	1
the	1
main	1
thing	1
the	1
drama	1
should	1
keep	1
in	1
view,	1
how	1
is	1
it	1
possible	1
for	1
any	1
average	1
understanding	1
to	1
be	1
satisfied	1
when	1
the	1
action	1
is	1
supposed	1
to	1
pass	1
in	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
King	1
Pepin	1
or	1
Charlemagne,	1
and	1
the	1
principal	1
personage	1
in	1
it	1
they	1
represent	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
Emperor	1
Heraclius	1
who	1
entered	1
Jerusalem	1
with	1
the	1
cross	1
and	1
won	1
the	1
Holy	1
Sepulchre,	1
like	1
Godfrey	1
of	1
Bouillon,	1
there	1
being	1
years	1
innumerable	1
between	1
the	1
one	1
and	1
the	1
other?	1
or,	1
if	1
the	1
play	1
is	1
based	1
on	1
fiction	1
and	1
historical	1
facts	1
are	1
introduced,	1
or	1
bits	1
of	1
what	1
occurred	1
to	1
different	1
people	1
and	1
at	1
different	1
times	1
mixed	1
up	1
with	1
it,	1
all,	1
not	1
only	1
without	1
any	1
semblance	1
of	1
probability,	1
but	1
with	1
obvious	1
errors	1
that	1
from	1
every	1
point	1
of	1
view	1
are	1
inexcusable?	1
And	1
the	1
worst	1
of	1
it	1
is,	1
there	1
are	1
ignorant	1
people	1
who	1
say	1
that	1
this	1
is	1
perfection,	1
and	1
that	1
anything	1
beyond	1
this	1
is	1
affected	1
refinement.	1
And	1
then	1
if	1
we	1
turn	1
to	1
sacred	1
dramas—what	1
miracles	1
they	1
invent	1
in	1
them!	1
What	1
apocryphal,	1
ill-devised	1
incidents,	1
attributing	1
to	1
one	1
saint	1
the	1
miracles	1
of	1
another!	1
And	1
even	1
in	1
secular	1
plays	1
they	1
venture	1
to	1
introduce	1
miracles	1
without	1
any	1
reason	1
or	1
object	1
except	1
that	1
they	1
think	1
some	1
such	1
miracle,	1
or	1
transformation	1
as	1
they	1
call	1
it,	1
will	1
come	1
in	1
well	1
to	1
astonish	1
stupid	1
people	1
and	1
draw	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
play.	1
All	1
this	1
tends	1
to	1
the	1
prejudice	1
of	1
the	1
truth	1
and	1
the	1
corruption	1
of	1
history,	1
nay	1
more,	1
to	1
the	1
reproach	1
of	1
the	1
wits	1
of	1
Spain;	1
for	1
foreigners	1
who	1
scrupulously	1
observe	1
the	1
laws	1
of	1
the	1
drama	1
look	1
upon	1
us	1
as	1
barbarous	1
and	1
ignorant,	1
when	1
they	1
see	1
the	1
absurdity	1
and	1
nonsense	1
of	1
the	1
plays	1
we	1
produce.	1
Nor	1
will	1
it	1
be	1
a	1
sufficient	1
excuse	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
the	1
chief	1
object	1
well-ordered	1
governments	1
have	1
in	1
view	1
when	1
they	1
permit	1
plays	1
to	1
be	1
performed	1
in	1
public	1
is	1
to	1
entertain	1
the	1
people	1
with	1
some	1
harmless	1
amusement	1
occasionally,	1
and	1
keep	1
it	1
from	1
those	1
evil	1
humours	1
which	1
idleness	1
is	1
apt	1
to	1
engender;	1
and	1
that,	1
as	1
this	1
may	1
be	1
attained	1
by	1
any	1
sort	1
of	1
play,	1
good	1
or	1
bad,	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
need	1
to	1
lay	1
down	1
laws,	1
or	1
bind	1
those	1
who	1
write	1
or	1
act	1
them	1
to	1
make	1
them	1
as	1
they	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
made,	1
since,	1
as	1
I	1
say,	1
the	1
object	1
sought	1
for	1
may	1
be	1
secured	1
by	1
any	1
sort.	1
To	1
this	1
I	1
would	1
reply	1
that	1
the	1
same	1
end	1
would	1
be,	1
beyond	1
all	1
comparison,	1
better	1
attained	1
by	1
means	1
of	1
good	1
plays	1
than	1
by	1
those	1
that	1
are	1
not	1
so;	1
for	1
after	1
listening	1
to	1
an	1
artistic	1
and	1
properly	1
constructed	1
play,	1
the	1
hearer	1
will	1
come	1
away	1
enlivened	1
by	1
the	1
jests,	1
instructed	1
by	1
the	1
serious	1
parts,	1
full	1
of	1
admiration	1
at	1
the	1
incidents,	1
his	1
wits	1
sharpened	1
by	1
the	1
arguments,	1
warned	1
by	1
the	1
tricks,	1
all	1
the	1
wiser	1
for	1
the	1
examples,	1
inflamed	1
against	1
vice,	1
and	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
virtue;	1
for	1
in	1
all	1
these	1
ways	1
a	1
good	1
play	1
will	1
stimulate	1
the	1
mind	1
of	1
the	1
hearer	1
be	1
he	1
ever	1
so	1
boorish	1
or	1
dull;	1
and	1
of	1
all	1
impossibilities	1
the	1
greatest	1
is	1
that	1
a	1
play	1
endowed	1
with	1
all	1
these	1
qualities	1
will	1
not	1
entertain,	1
satisfy,	1
and	1
please	1
much	1
more	1
than	1
one	1
wanting	1
in	1
them,	1
like	1
the	1
greater	1
number	1
of	1
those	1
which	1
are	1
commonly	1
acted	1
now-a-days.	1
Nor	1
are	1
the	1
poets	1
who	1
write	1
them	1
to	1
be	1
blamed	1
for	1
this;	1
for	1
some	1
there	1
are	1
among	1
them	1
who	1
are	1
perfectly	1
well	1
aware	1
of	1
their	1
faults,	1
and	1
know	1
what	1
they	1
ought	1
to	1
do;	1
but	1
as	1
plays	1
have	1
become	1
a	1
salable	1
commodity,	1
they	1
say,	1
and	1
with	1
truth,	1
that	1
the	1
actors	1
will	1
not	1
buy	1
them	1
unless	1
they	1
are	1
after	1
this	1
fashion;	1
and	1
so	1
the	1
poet	1
tries	1
to	1
adapt	1
himself	1
to	1
the	1
requirements	1
of	1
the	1
actor	1
who	1
is	1
to	1
pay	1
him	1
for	1
his	1
work.	1
And	1
that	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
truth	1
may	1
be	1
seen	1
by	1
the	1
countless	1
plays	1
that	1
a	1
most	1
fertile	1
wit	1
of	1
these	1
kingdoms	1
has	1
written,	1
with	1
so	1
much	1
brilliancy,	1
so	1
much	1
grace	1
and	1
gaiety,	1
such	1
polished	1
versification,	1
such	1
choice	1
language,	1
such	1
profound	1
reflections,	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
word,	1
so	1
rich	1
in	1
eloquence	1
and	1
elevation	1
of	1
style,	1
that	1
he	1
has	1
filled	1
the	1
world	1
with	1
his	1
fame;	1
and	1
yet,	1
in	1
consequence	1
of	1
his	1
desire	1
to	1
suit	1
the	1
taste	1
of	1
the	1
actors,	1
they	1
have	1
not	1
all,	1
as	1
some	1
of	1
them	1
have,	1
come	1
as	1
near	1
perfection	1
as	1
they	1
ought.	1
Others	1
write	1
plays	1
with	1
such	1
heedlessness	1
that,	1
after	1
they	1
have	1
been	1
acted,	1
the	1
actors	1
have	1
to	1
fly	1
and	1
abscond,	1
afraid	1
of	1
being	1
punished,	1
as	1
they	1
often	1
have	1
been,	1
for	1
having	1
acted	1
something	1
offensive	1
to	1
some	1
king	1
or	1
other,	1
or	1
insulting	1
to	1
some	1
noble	1
family.	1
All	1
which	1
evils,	1
and	1
many	1
more	1
that	1
I	1
say	1
nothing	1
of,	1
would	1
be	1
removed	1
if	1
there	1
were	1
some	1
intelligent	1
and	1
sensible	1
person	1
at	1
the	1
capital	1
to	1
examine	1
all	1
plays	1
before	1
they	1
were	1
acted,	1
not	1
only	1
those	1
produced	1
in	1
the	1
capital	1
itself,	1
but	1
all	1
that	1
were	1
intended	1
to	1
be	1
acted	1
in	1
Spain;	1
without	1
whose	1
approval,	1
seal,	1
and	1
signature,	1
no	1
local	1
magistracy	1
should	1
allow	1
any	1
play	1
to	1
be	1
acted.	1
In	1
that	1
case	1
actors	1
would	1
take	1
care	1
to	1
send	1
their	1
plays	1
to	1
the	1
capital,	1
and	1
could	1
act	1
them	1
in	1
safety,	1
and	1
those	1
who	1
write	1
them	1
would	1
be	1
more	1
careful	1
and	1
take	1
more	1
pains	1
with	1
their	1
work,	1
standing	1
in	1
awe	1
of	1
having	1
to	1
submit	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
strict	1
examination	1
of	1
one	1
who	1
understood	1
the	1
matter;	1
and	1
so	1
good	1
plays	1
would	1
be	1
produced	1
and	1
the	1
objects	1
they	1
aim	1
at	1
happily	1
attained;	1
as	1
well	1
the	1
amusement	1
of	1
the	1
people,	1
as	1
the	1
credit	1
of	1
the	1
wits	1
of	1
Spain,	1
the	1
interest	1
and	1
safety	1
of	1
the	1
actors,	1
and	1
the	1
saving	1
of	1
trouble	1
in	1
inflicting	1
punishment	1
on	1
them.	1
And	1
if	1
the	1
same	1
or	1
some	1
other	1
person	1
were	1
authorised	1
to	1
examine	1
the	1
newly	1
written	1
books	1
of	1
chivalry,	1
no	1
doubt	1
some	1
would	1
appear	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
perfections	1
you	1
have	1
described,	1
enriching	1
our	1
language	1
with	1
the	1
gracious	1
and	1
precious	1
treasure	1
of	1
eloquence,	1
and	1
driving	1
the	1
old	1
books	1
into	1
obscurity	1
before	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
the	1
new	1
ones	1
that	1
would	1
come	1
out	1
for	1
the	1
harmless	1
entertainment,	1
not	1
merely	1
of	1
the	1
idle	1
but	1
of	1
the	1
very	1
busiest;	1
for	1
the	1
bow	1
cannot	1
be	1
always	1
bent,	1
nor	1
can	1
weak	1
human	1
nature	1
exist	1
without	1
some	1
lawful	1
amusement.”	1
The	1
canon	1
and	1
the	1
curate	1
had	1
proceeded	1
thus	1
far	1
with	1
their	1
conversation,	1
when	1
the	1
barber,	1
coming	1
forward,	1
joined	1
them,	1
and	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
curate,	1
“This	1
is	1
the	1
spot,	1
señor	1
licentiate,	1
that	1
I	1
said	1
was	1
a	1
good	1
one	1
for	1
fresh	1
and	1
plentiful	1
pasture	1
for	1
the	1
oxen,	1
while	1
we	1
take	1
our	1
noontide	1
rest.”	1
“And	1
so	1
it	1
seems,”	1
returned	1
the	1
curate,	1
and	1
he	1
told	1
the	1
canon	1
what	1
he	1
proposed	1
to	1
do,	1
on	1
which	1
he	1
too	1
made	1
up	1
his	1
mind	1
to	1
halt	1
with	1
them,	1
attracted	1
by	1
the	1
aspect	1
of	1
the	1
fair	1
valley	1
that	1
lay	1
before	1
their	1
eyes;	1
and	1
to	1
enjoy	1
it	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
the	1
conversation	1
of	1
the	1
curate,	1
to	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
begun	1
to	1
take	1
a	1
fancy,	1
and	1
also	1
to	1
learn	1
more	1
particulars	1
about	1
the	1
doings	1
of	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
he	1
desired	1
some	1
of	1
his	1
servants	1
to	1
go	1
on	1
to	1
the	1
inn,	1
which	1
was	1
not	1
far	1
distant,	1
and	1
fetch	1
from	1
it	1
what	1
eatables	1
there	1
might	1
be	1
for	1
the	1
whole	1
party,	1
as	1
he	1
meant	1
to	1
rest	1
for	1
the	1
afternoon	1
where	1
he	1
was;	1
to	1
which	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
servants	1
replied	1
that	1
the	1
sumpter	1
mule,	1
which	1
by	1
this	1
time	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
reached	1
the	1
inn,	1
carried	1
provisions	1
enough	1
to	1
make	1
it	1
unnecessary	1
to	1
get	1
anything	1
from	1
the	1
inn	1
except	1
barley.	1
“In	1
that	1
case,”	1
said	1
the	1
canon,	1
“take	1
all	1
the	1
beasts	1
there,	1
and	1
bring	1
the	1
sumpter	1
mule	1
back.”	1
While	1
this	1
was	1
going	1
on,	1
Sancho,	1
perceiving	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
speak	1
to	1
his	1
master	1
without	1
having	1
the	1
curate	1
and	1
the	1
barber,	1
of	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
his	1
suspicions,	1
present	1
all	1
the	1
time,	1
approached	1
the	1
cage	1
in	1
which	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
was	1
placed,	1
and	1
said,	1
“Señor,	1
to	1
ease	1
my	1
conscience	1
I	1
want	1
to	1
tell	1
you	1
the	1
state	1
of	1
the	1
case	1
as	1
to	1
your	1
enchantment,	1
and	1
that	1
is	1
that	1
these	1
two	1
here,	1
with	1
their	1
faces	1
covered,	1
are	1
the	1
curate	1
of	1
our	1
village	1
and	1
the	1
barber;	1
and	1
I	1
suspect	1
they	1
have	1
hit	1
upon	1
this	1
plan	1
of	1
carrying	1
you	1
off	1
in	1
this	1
fashion,	1
out	1
of	1
pure	1
envy	1
because	1
your	1
worship	1
surpasses	1
them	1
in	1
doing	1
famous	1
deeds;	1
and	1
if	1
this	1
be	1
the	1
truth	1
it	1
follows	1
that	1
you	1
are	1
not	1
enchanted,	1
but	1
hoodwinked	1
and	1
made	1
a	1
fool	1
of.	1
And	1
to	1
prove	1
this	1
I	1
want	1
to	1
ask	1
you	1
one	1
thing;	1
and	1
if	1
you	1
answer	1
me	1
as	1
I	1
believe	1
you	1
will	1
answer,	1
you	1
will	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
lay	1
your	1
finger	1
on	1
the	1
trick,	1
and	1
you	1
will	1
see	1
that	1
you	1
are	1
not	1
enchanted	1
but	1
gone	1
wrong	1
in	1
your	1
wits.”	1
“Ask	1
what	1
thou	1
wilt,	1
Sancho	1
my	1
son,”	1
returned	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“for	1
I	1
will	1
satisfy	1
thee	1
and	1
answer	1
all	1
thou	1
requirest.	1
As	1
to	1
what	1
thou	1
sayest,	1
that	1
these	1
who	1
accompany	1
us	1
yonder	1
are	1
the	1
curate	1
and	1
the	1
barber,	1
our	1
neighbours	1
and	1
acquaintances,	1
it	1
is	1
very	1
possible	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
seem	1
to	1
be	1
those	1
same	1
persons;	1
but	1
that	1
they	1
are	1
so	1
in	1
reality	1
and	1
in	1
fact,	1
believe	1
it	1
not	1
on	1
any	1
account;	1
what	1
thou	1
art	1
to	1
believe	1
and	1
think	1
is	1
that,	1
if	1
they	1
look	1
like	1
them,	1
as	1
thou	1
sayest,	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
that	1
those	1
who	1
have	1
enchanted	1
me	1
have	1
taken	1
this	1
shape	1
and	1
likeness;	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
easy	1
for	1
enchanters	1
to	1
take	1
any	1
form	1
they	1
please,	1
and	1
they	1
may	1
have	1
taken	1
those	1
of	1
our	1
friends	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
make	1
thee	1
think	1
as	1
thou	1
dost,	1
and	1
lead	1
thee	1
into	1
a	1
labyrinth	1
of	1
fancies	1
from	1
which	1
thou	1
wilt	1
find	1
no	1
escape	1
though	1
thou	1
hadst	1
the	1
cord	1
of	1
Theseus;	1
and	1
they	1
may	1
also	1
have	1
done	1
it	1
to	1
make	1
me	1
uncertain	1
in	1
my	1
mind,	1
and	1
unable	1
to	1
conjecture	1
whence	1
this	1
evil	1
comes	1
to	1
me;	1
for	1
if	1
on	1
the	1
one	1
hand	1
thou	1
dost	1
tell	1
me	1
that	1
the	1
barber	1
and	1
curate	1
of	1
our	1
village	1
are	1
here	1
in	1
company	1
with	1
us,	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
I	1
find	1
myself	1
shut	1
up	1
in	1
a	1
cage,	1
and	1
know	1
in	1
my	1
heart	1
that	1
no	1
power	1
on	1
earth	1
that	1
was	1
not	1
supernatural	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
able	1
to	1
shut	1
me	1
in,	1
what	1
wouldst	1
thou	1
have	1
me	1
say	1
or	1
think,	1
but	1
that	1
my	1
enchantment	1
is	1
of	1
a	1
sort	1
that	1
transcends	1
all	1
I	1
have	1
ever	1
read	1
of	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
histories	1
that	1
deal	1
with	1
knights-errant	1
that	1
have	1
been	1
enchanted?	1
So	1
thou	1
mayest	1
set	1
thy	1
mind	1
at	1
rest	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
idea	1
that	1
they	1
are	1
what	1
thou	1
sayest,	1
for	1
they	1
are	1
as	1
much	1
so	1
as	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
Turk.	1
But	1
touching	1
thy	1
desire	1
to	1
ask	1
me	1
something,	1
say	1
on,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
answer	1
thee,	1
though	1
thou	1
shouldst	1
ask	1
questions	1
from	1
this	1
till	1
to-morrow	1
morning.”	1
“May	1
Our	1
Lady	1
be	1
good	1
to	1
me!”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
lifting	1
up	1
his	1
voice;	1
“and	1
is	1
it	1
possible	1
that	1
your	1
worship	1
is	1
so	1
thick	1
of	1
skull	1
and	1
so	1
short	1
of	1
brains	1
that	1
you	1
cannot	1
see	1
that	1
what	1
I	1
say	1
is	1
the	1
simple	1
truth,	1
and	1
that	1
malice	1
has	1
more	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
your	1
imprisonment	1
and	1
misfortune	1
than	1
enchantment?	1
But	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
so,	1
I	1
will	1
prove	1
plainly	1
to	1
you	1
that	1
you	1
are	1
not	1
enchanted.	1
Now	1
tell	1
me,	1
so	1
may	1
God	1
deliver	1
you	1
from	1
this	1
affliction,	1
and	1
so	1
may	1
you	1
find	1
yourself	1
when	1
you	1
least	1
expect	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
arms	1
of	1
my	1
lady	1
Dulcinea—”	1
“Leave	1
off	1
conjuring	1
me,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“and	1
ask	1
what	1
thou	1
wouldst	1
know;	1
I	1
have	1
already	1
told	1
thee	1
I	1
will	1
answer	1
with	1
all	1
possible	1
precision.”	1
“That	1
is	1
what	1
I	1
want,”	1
said	1
Sancho;	1
“and	1
what	1
I	1
would	1
know,	1
and	1
have	1
you	1
tell	1
me,	1
without	1
adding	1
or	1
leaving	1
out	1
anything,	1
but	1
telling	1
the	1
whole	1
truth	1
as	1
one	1
expects	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
told,	1
and	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
told,	1
by	1
all	1
who	1
profess	1
arms,	1
as	1
your	1
worship	1
professes	1
them,	1
under	1
the	1
title	1
of	1
knights-errant—”	1
“I	1
tell	1
thee	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
lie	1
in	1
any	1
particular,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
“finish	1
thy	1
question;	1
for	1
in	1
truth	1
thou	1
weariest	1
me	1
with	1
all	1
these	1
asseverations,	1
requirements,	1
and	1
precautions,	1
Sancho.”	1
“Well,	1
I	1
rely	1
on	1
the	1
goodness	1
and	1
truth	1
of	1
my	1
master,”	1
said	1
Sancho;	1
“and	1
so,	1
because	1
it	1
bears	1
upon	1
what	1
we	1
are	1
talking	1
about,	1
I	1
would	1
ask,	1
speaking	1
with	1
all	1
reverence,	1
whether	1
since	1
your	1
worship	1
has	1
been	1
shut	1
up	1
and,	1
as	1
you	1
think,	1
enchanted	1
in	1
this	1
cage,	1
you	1
have	1
felt	1
any	1
desire	1
or	1
inclination	1
to	1
go	1
anywhere,	1
as	1
the	1
saying	1
is?”	1
“I	1
do	1
not	1
understand	1
‘going	1
anywhere,’”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
“explain	1
thyself	1
more	1
clearly,	1
Sancho,	1
if	1
thou	1
wouldst	1
have	1
me	1
give	1
an	1
answer	1
to	1
the	1
point.”	1
“Is	1
it	1
possible,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“that	1
your	1
worship	1
does	1
not	1
understand	1
‘going	1
anywhere’?	1
Why,	1
the	1
schoolboys	1
know	1
that	1
from	1
the	1
time	1
they	1
were	1
babes.	1
Well	1
then,	1
you	1
must	1
know	1
I	1
mean	1
have	1
you	1
had	1
any	1
desire	1
to	1
do	1
what	1
cannot	1
be	1
avoided?”	1
“Ah!	1
now	1
I	1
understand	1
thee,	1
Sancho,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
“yes,	1
often,	1
and	1
even	1
this	1
minute;	1
get	1
me	1
out	1
of	1
this	1
strait,	1
or	1
all	1
will	1
not	1
go	1
right.”	1

“Aha,	1
I	1
have	1
caught	1
you,”	1
said	1
Sancho;	1
“this	1
is	1
what	1
in	1
my	1
heart	1
and	1
soul	1
I	1
was	1
longing	1
to	1
know.	1
Come	1
now,	1
señor,	1
can	1
you	1
deny	1
what	1
is	1
commonly	1
said	1
around	1
us,	1
when	1
a	1
person	1
is	1
out	1
of	1
humour,	1
‘I	1
don’t	1
know	1
what	1
ails	1
so-and-so,	1
that	1
he	1
neither	1
eats,	1
nor	1
drinks,	1
nor	1
sleeps,	1
nor	1
gives	1
a	1
proper	1
answer	1
to	1
any	1
question;	1
one	1
would	1
think	1
he	1
was	1
enchanted’?	1
From	1
which	1
it	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
gathered	1
that	1
those	1
who	1
do	1
not	1
eat,	1
or	1
drink,	1
or	1
sleep,	1
or	1
do	1
any	1
of	1
the	1
natural	1
acts	1
I	1
am	1
speaking	1
of—that	1
such	1
persons	1
are	1
enchanted;	1
but	1
not	1
those	1
that	1
have	1
the	1
desire	1
your	1
worship	1
has,	1
and	1
drink	1
when	1
drink	1
is	1
given	1
them,	1
and	1
eat	1
when	1
there	1
is	1
anything	1
to	1
eat,	1
and	1
answer	1
every	1
question	1
that	1
is	1
asked	1
them.”	1
“What	1
thou	1
sayest	1
is	1
true,	1
Sancho,”	1
replied	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
“but	1
I	1
have	1
already	1
told	1
thee	1
there	1
are	1
many	1
sorts	1
of	1
enchantments,	1
and	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
time	1
they	1
have	1
been	1
changed	1
one	1
for	1
another,	1
and	1
that	1
now	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
the	1
way	1
with	1
enchanted	1
people	1
to	1
do	1
all	1
that	1
I	1
do,	1
though	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
do	1
so	1
before;	1
so	1
it	1
is	1
vain	1
to	1
argue	1
or	1
draw	1
inferences	1
against	1
the	1
usage	1
of	1
the	1
time.	1
I	1
know	1
and	1
feel	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
enchanted,	1
and	1
that	1
is	1
enough	1
to	1
ease	1
my	1
conscience;	1
for	1
it	1
would	1
weigh	1
heavily	1
on	1
it	1
if	1
I	1
thought	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
not	1
enchanted,	1
and	1
that	1
in	1
a	1
faint-hearted	1
and	1
cowardly	1
way	1
I	1
allowed	1
myself	1
to	1
lie	1
in	1
this	1
cage,	1
defrauding	1
multitudes	1
of	1
the	1
succour	1
I	1
might	1
afford	1
to	1
those	1
in	1
need	1
and	1
distress,	1
who	1
at	1
this	1
very	1
moment	1
may	1
be	1
in	1
sore	1
want	1
of	1
my	1
aid	1
and	1
protection.”	1
“Still	1
for	1
all	1
that,”	1
replied	1
Sancho,	1
“I	1
say	1
that,	1
for	1
your	1
greater	1
and	1
fuller	1
satisfaction,	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
well	1
if	1
your	1
worship	1
were	1
to	1
try	1
to	1
get	1
out	1
of	1
this	1
prison	1
(and	1
I	1
promise	1
to	1
do	1
all	1
in	1
my	1
power	1
to	1
help,	1
and	1
even	1
to	1
take	1
you	1
out	1
of	1
it),	1
and	1
see	1
if	1
you	1
could	1
once	1
more	1
mount	1
your	1
good	1
Rocinante,	1
who	1
seems	1
to	1
be	1
enchanted	1
too,	1
he	1
is	1
so	1
melancholy	1
and	1
dejected;	1
and	1
then	1
we	1
might	1
try	1
our	1
chance	1
in	1
looking	1
for	1
adventures	1
again;	1
and	1
if	1
we	1
have	1
no	1
luck	1
there	1
will	1
be	1
time	1
enough	1
to	1
go	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
cage;	1
in	1
which,	1
on	1
the	1
faith	1
of	1
a	1
good	1
and	1
loyal	1
squire,	1
I	1
promise	1
to	1
shut	1
myself	1
up	1
along	1
with	1
your	1
worship,	1
if	1
so	1
be	1
you	1
are	1
so	1
unfortunate,	1
or	1
I	1
so	1
stupid,	1
as	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
carry	1
out	1
my	1
plan.”	1
“I	1
am	1
content	1
to	1
do	1
as	1
thou	1
sayest,	1
brother	1
Sancho,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“and	1
when	1
thou	1
seest	1
an	1
opportunity	1
for	1
effecting	1
my	1
release	1
I	1
will	1
obey	1
thee	1
absolutely;	1
but	1
thou	1
wilt	1
see,	1
Sancho,	1
how	1
mistaken	1
thou	1
art	1
in	1
thy	1
conception	1
of	1
my	1
misfortune.”	1
The	1
knight-errant	1
and	1
the	1
ill-errant	1
squire	1
kept	1
up	1
their	1
conversation	1
till	1
they	1
reached	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
the	1
curate,	1
the	1
canon,	1
and	1
the	1
barber,	1
who	1
had	1
already	1
dismounted,	1
were	1
waiting	1
for	1
them.	1
The	1
carter	1
at	1
once	1
unyoked	1
the	1
oxen	1
and	1
left	1
them	1
to	1
roam	1
at	1
large	1
about	1
the	1
pleasant	1
green	1
spot,	1
the	1
freshness	1
of	1
which	1
seemed	1
to	1
invite,	1
not	1
enchanted	1
people	1
like	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
but	1
wide-awake,	1
sensible	1
folk	1
like	1
his	1
squire,	1
who	1
begged	1
the	1
curate	1
to	1
allow	1
his	1
master	1
to	1
leave	1
the	1
cage	1
for	1
a	1
little;	1
for	1
if	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
let	1
him	1
out,	1
the	1
prison	1
might	1
not	1
be	1
as	1
clean	1
as	1
the	1
propriety	1
of	1
such	1
a	1
gentleman	1
as	1
his	1
master	1
required.	1
The	1
curate	1
understood	1
him,	1
and	1
said	1
he	1
would	1
very	1
gladly	1
comply	1
with	1
his	1
request,	1
only	1
that	1
he	1
feared	1
his	1
master,	1
finding	1
himself	1
at	1
liberty,	1
would	1
take	1
to	1
his	1
old	1
courses	1
and	1
make	1
off	1
where	1
nobody	1
could	1
ever	1
find	1
him	1
again.	1
“I	1
will	1
answer	1
for	1
his	1
not	1
running	1
away,”	1
said	1
Sancho.	1
“And	1
I	1
also,”	1
said	1
the	1
canon,	1
“especially	1
if	1
he	1
gives	1
me	1
his	1
word	1
as	1
a	1
knight	1
not	1
to	1
leave	1
us	1
without	1
our	1
consent.”	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
who	1
was	1
listening	1
to	1
all	1
this,	1
said,	1
“I	1
give	1
it;—moreover	1
one	1
who	1
is	1
enchanted	1
as	1
I	1
am	1
cannot	1
do	1
as	1
he	1
likes	1
with	1
himself;	1
for	1
he	1
who	1
had	1
enchanted	1
him	1
could	1
prevent	1
his	1
moving	1
from	1
one	1
place	1
for	1
three	1
ages,	1
and	1
if	1
he	1
attempted	1
to	1
escape	1
would	1
bring	1
him	1
back	1
flying.”—And	1
that	1
being	1
so,	1
they	1
might	1
as	1
well	1
release	1
him,	1
particularly	1
as	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
to	1
the	1
advantage	1
of	1
all;	1
for,	1
if	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
let	1
him	1
out,	1
he	1
protested	1
he	1
would	1
be	1
unable	1
to	1
avoid	1
offending	1
their	1
nostrils	1
unless	1
they	1
kept	1
their	1
distance.	1
The	1
canon	1
took	1
his	1
hand,	1
tied	1
together	1
as	1
they	1
both	1
were,	1
and	1
on	1
his	1
word	1
and	1
promise	1
they	1
unbound	1
him,	1
and	1
rejoiced	1
beyond	1
measure	1
he	1
was	1
to	1
find	1
himself	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
cage.	1
The	1
first	1
thing	1
he	1
did	1
was	1
to	1
stretch	1
himself	1
all	1
over,	1
and	1
then	1
he	1
went	1
to	1
where	1
Rocinante	1
was	1
standing	1
and	1
giving	1
him	1
a	1
couple	1
of	1
slaps	1
on	1
the	1
haunches	1
said,	1
“I	1
still	1
trust	1
in	1
God	1
and	1
in	1
his	1
blessed	1
mother,	1
O	1
flower	1
and	1
mirror	1
of	1
steeds,	1
that	1
we	1
shall	1
soon	1
see	1
ourselves,	1
both	1
of	1
us,	1
as	1
we	1
wish	1
to	1
be,	1
thou	1
with	1
thy	1
master	1
on	1
thy	1
back,	1
and	1
I	1
mounted	1
upon	1
thee,	1
following	1
the	1
calling	1
for	1
which	1
God	1
sent	1
me	1
into	1
the	1
world.”	1
And	1
so	1
saying,	1
accompanied	1
by	1
Sancho,	1
he	1
withdrew	1
to	1
a	1
retired	1
spot,	1
from	1
which	1
he	1
came	1
back	1
much	1
relieved	1
and	1
more	1
eager	1
than	1
ever	1
to	1
put	1
his	1
squire’s	1
scheme	1
into	1
execution.	1
The	1
canon	1
gazed	1
at	1
him,	1
wondering	1
at	1
the	1
extraordinary	1
nature	1
of	1
his	1
madness,	1
and	1
that	1
in	1
all	1
his	1
remarks	1
and	1
replies	1
he	1
should	1
show	1
such	1
excellent	1
sense,	1
and	1
only	1
lose	1
his	1
stirrups,	1
as	1
has	1
been	1
already	1
said,	1
when	1
the	1
subject	1
of	1
chivalry	1
was	1
broached.	1
And	1
so,	1
moved	1
by	1
compassion,	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
him,	1
as	1
they	1
all	1
sat	1
on	1
the	1
green	1
grass	1
awaiting	1
the	1
arrival	1
of	1
the	1
provisions:	1
“Is	1
it	1
possible,	1
gentle	1
sir,	1
that	1
the	1
nauseous	1
and	1
idle	1
reading	1
of	1
books	1
of	1
chivalry	1
can	1
have	1
had	1
such	1
an	1
effect	1
on	1
your	1
worship	1
as	1
to	1
upset	1
your	1
reason	1
so	1
that	1
you	1
fancy	1
yourself	1
enchanted,	1
and	1
the	1
like,	1
all	1
as	1
far	1
from	1
the	1
truth	1
as	1
falsehood	1
itself	1
is?	1
How	1
can	1
there	1
be	1
any	1
human	1
understanding	1
that	1
can	1
persuade	1
itself	1
there	1
ever	1
was	1
all	1
that	1
infinity	1
of	1
Amadises	1
in	1
the	1
world,	1
or	1
all	1
that	1
multitude	1
of	1
famous	1
knights,	1
all	1
those	1
emperors	1
of	1
Trebizond,	1
all	1
those	1
Felixmartes	1
of	1
Hircania,	1
all	1
those	1
palfreys,	1
and	1
damsels-errant,	1
and	1
serpents,	1
and	1
monsters,	1
and	1
giants,	1
and	1
marvellous	1
adventures,	1
and	1
enchantments	1
of	1
every	1
kind,	1
and	1
battles,	1
and	1
prodigious	1
encounters,	1
splendid	1
costumes,	1
love-sick	1
princesses,	1
squires	1
made	1
counts,	1
droll	1
dwarfs,	1
love	1
letters,	1
billings	1
and	1
cooings,	1
swashbuckler	1
women,	1
and,	1
in	1
a	1
word,	1
all	1
that	1
nonsense	1
the	1
books	1
of	1
chivalry	1
contain?	1
For	1
myself,	1
I	1
can	1
only	1
say	1
that	1
when	1
I	1
read	1
them,	1
so	1
long	1
as	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
stop	1
to	1
think	1
that	1
they	1
are	1
all	1
lies	1
and	1
frivolity,	1
they	1
give	1
me	1
a	1
certain	1
amount	1
of	1
pleasure;	1
but	1
when	1
I	1
come	1
to	1
consider	1
what	1
they	1
are,	1
I	1
fling	1
the	1
very	1
best	1
of	1
them	1
at	1
the	1
wall,	1
and	1
would	1
fling	1
it	1
into	1
the	1
fire	1
if	1
there	1
were	1
one	1
at	1
hand,	1
as	1
richly	1
deserving	1
such	1
punishment	1
as	1
cheats	1
and	1
impostors	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
range	1
of	1
ordinary	1
toleration,	1
and	1
as	1
founders	1
of	1
new	1
sects	1
and	1
modes	1
of	1
life,	1
and	1
teachers	1
that	1
lead	1
the	1
ignorant	1
public	1
to	1
believe	1
and	1
accept	1
as	1
truth	1
all	1
the	1
folly	1
they	1
contain.	1
And	1
such	1
is	1
their	1
audacity,	1
they	1
even	1
dare	1
to	1
unsettle	1
the	1
wits	1
of	1
gentlemen	1
of	1
birth	1
and	1
intelligence,	1
as	1
is	1
shown	1
plainly	1
by	1
the	1
way	1
they	1
have	1
served	1
your	1
worship,	1
when	1
they	1
have	1
brought	1
you	1
to	1
such	1
a	1
pass	1
that	1
you	1
have	1
to	1
be	1
shut	1
up	1
in	1
a	1
cage	1
and	1
carried	1
on	1
an	1
ox-cart	1
as	1
one	1
would	1
carry	1
a	1
lion	1
or	1
a	1
tiger	1
from	1
place	1
to	1
place	1
to	1
make	1
money	1
by	1
showing	1
it.	1
Come,	1
Señor	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
have	1
some	1
compassion	1
for	1
yourself,	1
return	1
to	1
the	1
bosom	1
of	1
common	1
sense,	1
and	1
make	1
use	1
of	1
the	1
liberal	1
share	1
of	1
it	1
that	1
heaven	1
has	1
been	1
pleased	1
to	1
bestow	1
upon	1
you,	1
employing	1
your	1
abundant	1
gifts	1
of	1
mind	1
in	1
some	1
other	1
reading	1
that	1
may	1
serve	1
to	1
benefit	1
your	1
conscience	1
and	1
add	1
to	1
your	1
honour.	1
And	1
if,	1
still	1
led	1
away	1
by	1
your	1
natural	1
bent,	1
you	1
desire	1
to	1
read	1
books	1
of	1
achievements	1
and	1
of	1
chivalry,	1
read	1
the	1
Book	1
of	1
Judges	1
in	1
the	1
Holy	1
Scriptures,	1
for	1
there	1
you	1
will	1
find	1
grand	1
reality,	1
and	1
deeds	1
as	1
true	1
as	1
they	1
are	1
heroic.	1
Lusitania	1
had	1
a	1
Viriatus,	1
Rome	1
a	1
Cæsar,	1

Here,	1
Señor	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
will	1
be	1
reading	1
worthy	1
of	1
your	1
sound	1
understanding;	1
from	1
which	1
you	1
will	1

and	1
all	1
to	1

honour	1

advantage	1
and	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
La	1
Mancha,	1
whence,	1
I	1
am	1
informed,	1
your	1
worship	1
derives	1
your	1
birth.”	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
listened	1
with	1
the	1
greatest	1
attention	1
to	1
the	1
canon’s	1
words,	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
found	1
he	1
had	1
finished,	1
after	1
regarding	1
him	1
for	1
some	1
time,	1
he	1
replied	1
to	1
him:	1
“It	1
appears	1
to	1
me,	1
gentle	1
sir,	1
that	1
your	1
worship’s	1
discourse	1
is	1
intended	1
to	1
persuade	1
me	1
that	1
there	1
never	1
were	1
any	1
knights-errant	1
in	1
the	1
world,	1
and	1
that	1
all	1
the	1
books	1
of	1
chivalry	1
are	1
false,	1
lying,	1
mischievous	1
and	1
useless	1
to	1
the	1
State,	1
and	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
done	1
wrong	1
in	1
reading	1
them,	1
and	1
worse	1
in	1
believing	1
them,	1
and	1
still	1
worse	1
in	1
imitating	1
them,	1
when	1
I	1
undertook	1
to	1
follow	1
the	1
arduous	1
calling	1
of	1
knight-errantry	1
which	1
they	1
set	1
forth;	1
for	1
you	1
deny	1
that	1
there	1
ever	1
were	1
Amadises	1
of	1
Gaul	1
or	1
of	1
Greece,	1
or	1
any	1
other	1
of	1
the	1
knights	1
of	1
whom	1
the	1
books	1
are	1
full.”	1
“It	1
is	1
all	1
exactly	1
as	1
you	1
state	1
it,”	1
said	1
the	1
canon;	1
to	1
which	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
returned,	1
“You	1
also	1
went	1
on	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
books	1
of	1
this	1
kind	1
had	1
done	1
me	1
much	1
harm,	1
inasmuch	1
as	1
they	1
had	1
upset	1
my	1
senses,	1
and	1
shut	1
me	1
up	1
in	1
a	1
cage,	1
and	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
better	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
reform	1
and	1
change	1
my	1
studies,	1
and	1
read	1
other	1
truer	1
books	1
which	1
would	1
afford	1
more	1
pleasure	1
and	1
instruction.”	1
“Just	1
so,”	1
said	1
the	1
canon.	1
“Well	1
then,”	1
returned	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“to	1
my	1
mind	1
it	1
is	1
you	1
who	1
are	1
the	1
one	1
that	1
is	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
wits	1
and	1
enchanted,	1
as	1
you	1
have	1
ventured	1
to	1
utter	1
such	1
blasphemies	1
against	1
a	1
thing	1
so	1
universally	1
acknowledged	1
and	1
accepted	1
as	1
true	1
that	1
whoever	1
denies	1
it,	1
as	1
you	1
do,	1
deserves	1
the	1
same	1
punishment	1
which	1
you	1
say	1
you	1
inflict	1
on	1
the	1
books	1
that	1
irritate	1
you	1
when	1
you	1
read	1
them.	1
For	1
to	1
try	1
to	1
persuade	1
anybody	1
that	1
Amadis,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
other	1
knights-adventurers	1
with	1
whom	1
the	1
books	1
are	1
filled,	1
never	1
existed,	1
would	1
be	1
like	1
trying	1
to	1
persuade	1
him	1
that	1
the	1
sun	1
does	1
not	1
yield	1
light,	1
or	1
ice	1
cold,	1
or	1
earth	1
nourishment.	1
What	1
wit	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
can	1
persuade	1
another	1
that	1
the	1
story	1
of	1
the	1
Princess	1
Floripes	1
and	1
Guy	1
of	1
Burgundy	1
is	1
not	1
true,	1
or	1
that	1
of	1
Fierabras	1
and	1
the	1
bridge	1
of	1
Mantible,	1
which	1
happened	1
in	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
Charlemagne?	1
For	1
by	1
all	1
that	1
is	1
good	1
it	1
is	1
as	1
true	1
as	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
daylight	1
now;	1
and	1
if	1
it	1
be	1
a	1
lie,	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
a	1
lie	1
too	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
Hector,	1
or	1
Achilles,	1
or	1
Trojan	1
war,	1
or	1
Twelve	1
Peers	1
of	1
France,	1
or	1
Arthur	1
of	1
England,	1
who	1
still	1
lives	1
changed	1
into	1
a	1
raven,	1
and	1
is	1
unceasingly	1
looked	1
for	1
in	1
his	1
kingdom.	1
One	1
might	1
just	1
as	1
well	1
try	1
to	1
make	1
out	1
that	1
the	1
history	1
of	1
Guarino	1
Mezquino,	1
or	1
of	1
the	1
quest	1
of	1
the	1
Holy	1
Grail,	1
is	1
false,	1
or	1
that	1
the	1
loves	1
of	1
Tristram	1
and	1
the	1
Queen	1
Yseult	1
are	1
apocryphal,	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
those	1
of	1
Guinevere	1
and	1
Lancelot,	1
when	1
there	1
are	1
persons	1
who	1
can	1
almost	1
remember	1
having	1
seen	1
the	1
Dame	1
Quintañona,	1
who	1
was	1
the	1
best	1
cupbearer	1
in	1
Great	1
Britain.	1
And	1
so	1
true	1
is	1
this,	1
that	1
I	1
recollect	1
a	1
grandmother	1
of	1
mine	1
on	1
the	1
father’s	1
side,	1
whenever	1
she	1
saw	1
any	1
dame	1
in	1
a	1
venerable	1
hood,	1
used	1
to	1
say	1
to	1
me,	1
‘Grandson,	1
that	1
one	1
is	1
like	1
Dame	1
Quintañona,’	1
from	1
which	1
I	1
conclude	1
that	1
she	1
must	1
have	1
known	1
her,	1
or	1
at	1
least	1
had	1
managed	1
to	1
see	1
some	1
portrait	1
of	1
her.	1
Then	1
who	1
can	1
deny	1
that	1
the	1
story	1
of	1
Pierres	1
and	1
the	1
fair	1
Magalona	1
is	1
true,	1
when	1
even	1
to	1
this	1
day	1
may	1
be	1
seen	1
in	1
the	1
king’s	1
armoury	1
the	1
pin	1
with	1
which	1
the	1
valiant	1
Pierres	1
guided	1
the	1
wooden	1
horse	1
he	1
rode	1
through	1
the	1
air,	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
trifle	1
bigger	1
than	1
the	1
pole	1
of	1
a	1
cart?	1
And	1
alongside	1
of	1
the	1
pin	1
is	1
Babieca’s	1
saddle,	1
and	1
at	1
Roncesvalles	1
there	1
is	1
Roland’s	1
horn,	1
as	1
large	1
as	1
a	1
large	1
beam;	1
whence	1
we	1
may	1
infer	1
that	1
there	1
were	1
Twelve	1
Peers,	1
and	1
a	1
Pierres,	1
and	1
a	1
Cid,	1
and	1
other	1
knights	1
like	1
them,	1
of	1
the	1
sort	1
people	1
commonly	1
call	1
adventurers.	1
Or	1
perhaps	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
told,	1
too,	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
such	1
knight-errant	1
as	1
the	1
valiant	1
Lusitanian	1
Juan	1
de	1
Merlo,	1
who	1
went	1
to	1
Burgundy	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
Arras	1
fought	1
with	1
the	1
famous	1
lord	1
of	1
Charny,	1
Mosen	1
Pierres	1
by	1
name,	1
and	1
afterwards	1
in	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
Basle	1
with	1
Mosen	1
Enrique	1
de	1
Remesten,	1
coming	1
out	1
of	1
both	1
encounters	1
covered	1
with	1
fame	1
and	1
honour;	1
or	1
adventures	1
and	1
challenges	1
achieved	1
and	1
delivered,	1
also	1
in	1
Burgundy,	1
by	1
the	1
valiant	1
Spaniards	1
Pedro	1
Barba	1
and	1
Gutierre	1
Quixada	1
(of	1
whose	1
family	1
I	1
come	1
in	1
the	1
direct	1
male	1
line),	1
when	1
they	1
vanquished	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
the	1
Count	1
of	1
San	1
Polo.	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
told,	1
too,	1
that	1
Don	1
Fernando	1
de	1
Guevara	1
did	1
not	1
go	1
in	1
quest	1
of	1
adventures	1
to	1
Germany,	1
where	1
he	1
engaged	1
in	1
combat	1
with	1
Micer	1
George,	1
a	1
knight	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
Duke	1
of	1
Austria.	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
told	1
that	1
the	1
jousts	1
of	1
Suero	1
de	1
Quiñones,	1
him	1
of	1
the	1
‘Paso,’	1
and	1
the	1
emprise	1
of	1
Mosen	1
Luis	1
de	1
Falces	1
against	1
the	1
Castilian	1
knight,	1
Don	1
Gonzalo	1
de	1
Guzman,	1
were	1
mere	1
mockeries;	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
many	1
other	1
achievements	1
of	1
Christian	1
knights	1
of	1
these	1
and	1
foreign	1
realms,	1
which	1
are	1
so	1
authentic	1
and	1
true,	1
that,	1
I	1
repeat,	1
he	1
who	1
denies	1
them	1
must	1
be	1
totally	1
wanting	1
in	1
reason	1
and	1
good	1
sense.”	1
The	1
canon	1
was	1
amazed	1
to	1
hear	1
the	1
medley	1
of	1
truth	1
and	1
fiction	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
uttered,	1
and	1
to	1
see	1
how	1
well	1
acquainted	1
he	1
was	1
with	1
everything	1
relating	1
or	1
belonging	1
to	1
the	1
achievements	1
of	1
his	1
knight-errantry;	1
so	1
he	1
said	1
in	1
reply:	1
“I	1
cannot	1
deny,	1
Señor	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
some	1
truth	1
in	1
what	1
you	1
say,	1
especially	1
as	1
regards	1
the	1
Spanish	1
knights-errant;	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
willing	1
to	1
grant	1
too	1
that	1
the	1
Twelve	1
Peers	1
of	1
France	1
existed,	1
but	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
disposed	1
to	1
believe	1
that	1
they	1
did	1
all	1
the	1
things	1
that	1
the	1
Archbishop	1
Turpin	1
relates	1
of	1
them.	1
For	1
the	1
truth	1
of	1
the	1
matter	1
is	1
they	1
were	1
knights	1
chosen	1
by	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
France,	1
and	1
called	1
‘Peers’	1
because	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
equal	1
in	1
worth,	1
rank	1
and	1
prowess	1
(at	1
least	1
if	1
they	1
were	1
not	1
they	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
been),	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
kind	1
of	1
religious	1
order	1
like	1
those	1
of	1
Santiago	1
and	1
Calatrava	1
in	1
the	1
present	1
day,	1
in	1
which	1
it	1
is	1
assumed	1
that	1
those	1
who	1
take	1
it	1
are	1
valiant	1
knights	1
of	1
distinction	1
and	1
good	1
birth;	1
and	1
just	1
as	1
we	1
say	1
now	1
a	1
Knight	1
of	1
St.	1
John,	1
or	1
of	1
Alcántara,	1
they	1
used	1
to	1
say	1
then	1
a	1
Knight	1
of	1
the	1
Twelve	1
Peers,	1
because	1
twelve	1
equals	1
were	1
chosen	1
for	1
that	1
military	1
order.	1
That	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
Cid,	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
a	1
Bernardo	1
del	1
Carpio,	1
there	1
can	1
be	1
no	1
doubt;	1
but	1
that	1
they	1
did	1
the	1
deeds	1
people	1
say	1
they	1
did,	1
I	1
hold	1
to	1
be	1
very	1
doubtful.	1
In	1
that	1
other	1
matter	1
of	1
the	1
pin	1
of	1
Count	1
Pierres	1
that	1
you	1
speak	1
of,	1
and	1
say	1
is	1
near	1
Babieca’s	1
saddle	1
in	1
the	1
Armoury,	1
I	1
confess	1
my	1
sin;	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
either	1
so	1
stupid	1
or	1
so	1
short-sighted,	1
that,	1
though	1
I	1
have	1
seen	1
the	1
saddle,	1
I	1
have	1
never	1
been	1
able	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
pin,	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
it	1
being	1
as	1
big	1
as	1
your	1
worship	1
says	1
it	1
is.”	1
“For	1
all	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
there,	1
without	1
any	1
manner	1
of	1
doubt,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
“and	1
more	1
by	1
token	1
they	1
say	1
it	1
is	1
inclosed	1
in	1
a	1
sheath	1
of	1
cowhide	1
to	1
keep	1
it	1
from	1
rusting.”	1
“All	1
that	1
may	1
be,”	1
replied	1
the	1
canon;	1
“but,	1
by	1
the	1
orders	1
I	1
have	1
received,	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
remember	1
seeing	1
it.	1
However,	1
granting	1
it	1
is	1
there,	1
that	1
is	1
no	1
reason	1
why	1
I	1
am	1
bound	1
to	1
believe	1
the	1
stories	1
of	1
all	1
those	1
Amadises	1
and	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
multitude	1
of	1
knights	1
they	1
tell	1
us	1
about,	1
nor	1
is	1
it	1
reasonable	1
that	1
a	1
man	1
like	1
your	1
worship,	1
so	1
worthy,	1
and	1
with	1
so	1
many	1
good	1
qualities,	1
and	1
endowed	1
with	1
such	1
a	1
good	1
understanding,	1
should	1
allow	1
himself	1
to	1
be	1
persuaded	1
that	1
such	1
wild	1
crazy	1
things	1
as	1
are	1
written	1
in	1
those	1
absurd	1
books	1
of	1
chivalry	1
are	1
really	1
true.”	1

“A	1
good	1
joke,	1
that!”	1
returned	1
Don	1
Quixote.	1
“Books	1
that	1
have	1
been	1
printed	1
with	1
the	1
king’s	1
licence,	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
approbation	1
of	1
those	1
to	1
whom	1
they	1
have	1
been	1
submitted,	1
and	1
read	1
with	1
universal	1
delight,	1
and	1
extolled	1
by	1
great	1
and	1
small,	1
rich	1
and	1
poor,	1
learned	1
and	1
ignorant,	1
gentle	1
and	1
simple,	1
in	1
a	1
word	1
by	1
people	1
of	1
every	1
sort,	1
of	1
whatever	1
rank	1
or	1
condition	1
they	1
may	1
be—that	1
these	1
should	1
be	1
lies!	1
And	1
above	1
all	1
when	1
they	1
carry	1
such	1
an	1
appearance	1
of	1
truth	1
with	1
them;	1
for	1
they	1
tell	1
us	1
the	1
father,	1
mother,	1
country,	1
kindred,	1
age,	1
place,	1
and	1
the	1
achievements,	1
step	1
by	1
step,	1
and	1
day	1
by	1
day,	1
performed	1
by	1
such	1
a	1
knight	1
or	1
knights!	1
Hush,	1
sir;	1
utter	1
not	1
such	1
blasphemy;	1
trust	1
me	1
I	1
am	1
advising	1
you	1
now	1
to	1
act	1
as	1
a	1
sensible	1
man	1
should;	1
only	1
read	1
them,	1
and	1
you	1

For,	1
come,	1

can	1
there	1
be	1
anything	1
more	1
delightful	1
than	1
to	1
see,	1
as	1
it	1
were,	1
here	1

displayed	1
before	1
us	1
a	1
vast	1
lake	1
of	1
bubbling	1

with	1
a	1
host	1
of	1
snakes	1

serpents	1

lizards,	1

ferocious	1

terrible	1
creatures	1
of	1
all	1
sorts	1
swimming	1
about	1
in	1
it,	1
while	1
from	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
lake	1
there	1
comes	1
a	1
plaintive	1
voice	1
saying:	1
‘Knight,	1
whosoever	1
thou	1
art	1
who	1
beholdest	1
this	1
dread	1
lake,	1
if	1
thou	1
wouldst	1
win	1
the	1
prize	1
that	1
lies	1
hidden	1
beneath	1
these	1
dusky	1
waves,	1
prove	1
the	1
valour	1
of	1
thy	1
stout	1
heart	1
and	1
cast	1
thyself	1
into	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
its	1
dark	1
burning	1
waters,	1
else	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
be	1
worthy	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
mighty	1
wonders	1
contained	1
in	1
the	1
seven	1
castles	1
of	1
the	1
seven	1
Fays	1
that	1
lie	1
beneath	1
this	1
black	1
expanse;’	1
and	1
then	1
the	1
knight,	1
almost	1
ere	1
the	1
awful	1
voice	1
has	1
ceased,	1
without	1
stopping	1
to	1
consider,	1
without	1
pausing	1
to	1
reflect	1
upon	1
the	1
danger	1
to	1
which	1
he	1
is	1
exposing	1
himself,	1
without	1
even	1
relieving	1
himself	1
of	1
the	1
weight	1
of	1
his	1
massive	1
armour,	1
commending	1
himself	1
to	1
God	1
and	1
to	1
his	1
lady,	1
plunges	1
into	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
boiling	1
lake,	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
little	1
looks	1
for	1
it,	1
or	1
knows	1
what	1
his	1
fate	1
is	1
to	1
be,	1
he	1
finds	1
himself	1
among	1
flowery	1
meadows,	1
with	1
which	1
the	1
Elysian	1
fields	1
are	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
compared.	1

set	1
out	1

that	1

that	1

I	1
have	1
become	1
valiant,	1
polite,	1
generous,	1
well-bred,	1
magnanimous,	1
courteous,	1
dauntless,	1
gentle,	1
patient,	1
and	1
have	1
learned	1
to	1
bear	1
hardships,	1
imprisonments,	1
and	1
enchantments;	1
and	1
though	1
it	1
be	1
such	1
a	1
short	1

since	1
I	1
have	1
seen	1
myself	1
shut	1
up	1

I	1
hope	1
by	1
the	1
might	1
of	1
my	1
arm,	1
if	1
heaven	1
aid	1
me	1
and	1
fortune	1
thwart	1
me	1
not,	1
to	1
see	1
myself	1
king	1
of	1
some	1
kingdom	1
where	1
I	1
may	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
show	1
the	1
gratitude	1
and	1
generosity	1
that	1
dwell	1
in	1
my	1
heart;	1
for	1
by	1
my	1
faith,	1
señor,	1
the	1
poor	1
man	1

incapacitated	1
from	1
showing	1
the	1

of	1
generosity	1
to	1
anyone,	1
though	1
he	1
may	1
possess	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
highest	1
degree;	1
and	1
gratitude	1
that	1
consists	1
of	1
disposition	1
only	1
is	1
a	1
dead	1
thing,	1
just	1
as	1
faith	1
without	1

dead.	1
For	1
this	1
reason	1
I	1
should	1

soon	1
to	1
offer	1
me	1
some	1

good	1
to	1
my	1
friends,	1
particularly	1
to	1
this	1
poor	1
Sancho	1
Panza,	1
my	1
squire,	1
who	1
is	1
the	1
best	1
fellow	1
in	1
the	1
world;	1
and	1
I	1
would	1
gladly	1
give	1
him	1
a	1

I	1
have	1

him	1
this	1
ever	1
so	1

only	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
afraid	1
he	1
has	1
not	1
the	1
capacity	1
to	1
govern	1
his	1
realm.”	1
Sancho	1
partly	1
heard	1
these	1
last	1
words	1
of	1
his	1
master,	1
and	1
said	1
to	1
him,	1
“Strive	1
hard	1
you,	1
Señor	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
to	1
give	1
me	1
that	1
county	1
so	1
often	1
promised	1
by	1
you	1
and	1
so	1
long	1
looked	1
for	1
by	1
me,	1
for	1
I	1
promise	1
you	1
there	1
will	1
be	1
no	1
want	1
of	1
capacity	1
in	1
me	1
to	1
govern	1
it;	1
and	1
even	1
if	1
there	1
is,	1
I	1
have	1
heard	1
say	1
there	1
are	1
men	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
who	1
farm	1
seigniories,	1
paying	1
so	1
much	1
a	1
year,	1
and	1
they	1
themselves	1
taking	1
charge	1
of	1
the	1
government,	1
while	1
the	1
lord,	1
with	1
his	1
legs	1
stretched	1
out,	1
enjoys	1
the	1
revenue	1
they	1
pay	1
him,	1
without	1
troubling	1
himself	1
about	1
anything	1
else.	1
That’s	1
what	1
I’ll	1
do,	1
and	1
not	1
stand	1
haggling	1
over	1
trifles,	1
but	1
wash	1
my	1
hands	1
at	1
once	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
business,	1
and	1
enjoy	1
my	1
rents	1
like	1
a	1
duke,	1
and	1
let	1
things	1
go	1
their	1
own	1
way.”	1
“That,	1
brother	1
Sancho,”	1
said	1
the	1
canon,	1
“only	1
holds	1
good	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
the	1
enjoyment	1
of	1
the	1
revenue	1
goes;	1
but	1
the	1
lord	1
of	1
the	1
seigniory	1
must	1
attend	1
to	1
the	1
administration	1
of	1
justice,	1
and	1
here	1
capacity	1
and	1
sound	1
judgment	1
come	1
in,	1
and	1
above	1
all	1
a	1
firm	1
determination	1
to	1
find	1
out	1
the	1
truth;	1
for	1
if	1
this	1
be	1
wanting	1
in	1
the	1
beginning,	1
the	1
middle	1
and	1
the	1
end	1
will	1
always	1
go	1
wrong;	1
and	1
God	1
as	1
commonly	1
aids	1
the	1
honest	1
intentions	1
of	1
the	1
simple	1
as	1
he	1
frustrates	1
the	1
evil	1
designs	1
of	1
the	1
crafty.”	1
“I	1
don’t	1
understand	1
those	1
philosophies,”	1
returned	1
Sancho	1
Panza;	1
“all	1
I	1
know	1
is	1
I	1
would	1
I	1
had	1
the	1
county	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
I	1
shall	1
know	1
how	1
to	1
govern	1
it;	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
as	1
much	1
soul	1
as	1
another,	1
and	1
as	1
much	1
body	1
as	1
anyone,	1
and	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
as	1
much	1
king	1
of	1
my	1
realm	1
as	1
any	1
other	1
of	1
his;	1
and	1
being	1
so	1
I	1
should	1
do	1
as	1
I	1
liked,	1
and	1
doing	1
as	1
I	1
liked	1
I	1
should	1
please	1
myself,	1
and	1
pleasing	1
myself	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
content,	1
and	1
when	1
one	1
is	1
content	1
he	1
has	1
nothing	1
more	1
to	1
desire,	1
and	1
when	1
one	1
has	1
nothing	1
more	1
to	1
desire	1
there	1
is	1
an	1
end	1
of	1
it;	1
so	1
let	1
the	1
county	1
come,	1
and	1
God	1
be	1
with	1
you,	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
see	1
one	1
another,	1
as	1
one	1
blind	1
man	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
other.”	1
“That	1
is	1
not	1
bad	1
philosophy	1
thou	1
art	1
talking,	1
Sancho,”	1
said	1
the	1
canon;	1
“but	1
for	1
all	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
good	1
deal	1
to	1
be	1
said	1
on	1
this	1
matter	1
of	1
counties.”	1
To	1
which	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
returned,	1
“I	1
know	1
not	1
what	1
more	1
there	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
said;	1
I	1
only	1
guide	1
myself	1
by	1
the	1
example	1
set	1
me	1
by	1
the	1
great	1
Amadis	1
of	1
Gaul,	1
when	1
he	1
made	1
his	1
squire	1
count	1
of	1
the	1
Insula	1
Firme;	1
and	1
so,	1
without	1
any	1
scruples	1
of	1
conscience,	1
I	1
can	1
make	1
a	1
count	1
of	1
Sancho	1
Panza,	1
for	1
he	1
is	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
best	1
squires	1
that	1
ever	1
knight-errant	1
had.”	1
The	1
canon	1
was	1
astonished	1
at	1
the	1
methodical	1
nonsense	1
(if	1
nonsense	1
be	1
capable	1
of	1
method)	1
that	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
uttered,	1
at	1
the	1
way	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
described	1
the	1
adventure	1
of	1
the	1
knight	1
of	1
the	1
lake,	1
at	1
the	1
impression	1
that	1
the	1
deliberate	1
lies	1
of	1
the	1
books	1
he	1
read	1
had	1
made	1
upon	1
him,	1
and	1
lastly	1
he	1
marvelled	1
at	1
the	1
simplicity	1
of	1
Sancho,	1
who	1
desired	1
so	1
eagerly	1
to	1
obtain	1
the	1
county	1
his	1
master	1
had	1
promised	1
him.	1
By	1
this	1
time	1
the	1
canon’s	1
servants,	1
who	1
had	1
gone	1
to	1
the	1
inn	1
to	1
fetch	1
the	1
sumpter	1
mule,	1
had	1
returned,	1
and	1
making	1
a	1
carpet	1
and	1
the	1
green	1
grass	1
of	1
the	1
meadow	1
serve	1
as	1
a	1
table,	1
they	1
seated	1
themselves	1
in	1
the	1
shade	1
of	1
some	1
trees	1
and	1
made	1
their	1
repast	1
there,	1
that	1
the	1
carter	1
might	1
not	1
be	1
deprived	1
of	1
the	1
advantage	1
of	1
the	1
spot,	1
as	1
has	1
been	1
already	1
said.	1
As	1
they	1
were	1
eating	1
they	1
suddenly	1
heard	1
a	1
loud	1
noise	1
and	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
a	1
bell	1
that	1
seemed	1
to	1
come	1
from	1
among	1
some	1
brambles	1
and	1
thick	1
bushes	1
that	1
were	1
close	1
by,	1
and	1
the	1
same	1
instant	1
they	1
observed	1
a	1
beautiful	1
goat,	1
spotted	1
all	1
over	1
black,	1
white,	1
and	1
brown,	1
spring	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
thicket	1
with	1
a	1
goatherd	1
after	1
it,	1
calling	1
to	1
it	1
and	1
uttering	1
the	1
usual	1
cries	1
to	1
make	1
it	1
stop	1
or	1
turn	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
fold.	1
The	1
fugitive	1
goat,	1
scared	1
and	1
frightened,	1
ran	1
towards	1
the	1
company	1
as	1
if	1
seeking	1
their	1
protection	1
and	1
then	1
stood	1
still,	1
and	1
the	1
goatherd	1
coming	1
up	1
seized	1
it	1
by	1
the	1
horns	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
talk	1
to	1
it	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
possessed	1
of	1
reason	1
and	1
understanding:	1
“Ah	1
wanderer,	1
wanderer,	1
Spotty,	1
Spotty;	1
how	1
have	1
you	1
gone	1
limping	1
all	1
this	1
time?	1
What	1
wolves	1
have	1
frightened	1
you,	1
my	1
daughter?	1
Won’t	1
you	1
tell	1
me	1
what	1
is	1
the	1
matter,	1
my	1
beauty?	1
But	1
what	1
else	1
can	1
it	1
be	1
except	1
that	1
you	1
are	1
a	1
she,	1
and	1
cannot	1
keep	1
quiet?	1
A	1
plague	1
on	1
your	1
humours	1
and	1
the	1
humours	1
of	1
those	1
you	1
take	1
after!	1
Come	1
back,	1
come	1
back,	1
my	1
darling;	1
and	1
if	1
you	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
so	1
happy,	1
at	1
any	1
rate	1
you	1
will	1
be	1
safe	1
in	1
the	1
fold	1
or	1
with	1
your	1
companions;	1
for	1
if	1
you	1
who	1
ought	1
to	1
keep	1
and	1
lead	1
them,	1
go	1
wandering	1
astray,	1
what	1
will	1
become	1
of	1
them?”	1
The	1
goatherd’s	1
talk	1
amused	1
all	1
who	1
heard	1
it,	1
but	1
especially	1
the	1
canon,	1
who	1
said	1
to	1
him,	1
“As	1
you	1
live,	1
brother,	1
take	1
it	1
easy,	1
and	1
be	1
not	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
hurry	1
to	1
drive	1
this	1
goat	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
fold;	1
for,	1
being	1
a	1
female,	1
as	1
you	1
say,	1
she	1
will	1
follow	1
her	1
natural	1
instinct	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
all	1
you	1
can	1
do	1
to	1
prevent	1
it.	1
Take	1
this	1
morsel	1
and	1
drink	1
a	1
sup,	1
and	1
that	1
will	1
soothe	1
your	1
irritation,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
meantime	1
the	1
goat	1
will	1
rest	1
herself,”	1
and	1
so	1
saying,	1
he	1
handed	1
him	1
the	1
loins	1
of	1
a	1
cold	1
rabbit	1
on	1
a	1
fork.	1
The	1
goatherd	1
took	1
it	1
with	1
thanks,	1
and	1
drank	1
and	1
calmed	1
himself,	1
and	1
then	1
said,	1
“I	1
should	1
be	1
sorry	1
if	1
your	1
worships	1
were	1
to	1
take	1
me	1
for	1
a	1
simpleton	1
for	1
having	1
spoken	1
so	1
seriously	1
as	1
I	1
did	1
to	1
this	1
animal;	1
but	1
the	1
truth	1
is	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
certain	1
mystery	1
in	1
the	1
words	1
I	1
used.	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
clown,	1
but	1
not	1
so	1
much	1
of	1
one	1
but	1
that	1
I	1
know	1
how	1
to	1
behave	1
to	1
men	1
and	1
to	1
beasts.”	1
“That	1
I	1
can	1
well	1
believe,”	1
said	1
the	1
curate,	1
“for	1
I	1
know	1
already	1
by	1
experience	1
that	1
the	1
woods	1
breed	1
men	1
of	1
learning,	1
and	1
shepherds’	1
huts	1
harbour	1
philosophers.”	1
“At	1
all	1
events,	1
señor,”	1
returned	1
the	1
goatherd,	1
“they	1
shelter	1
men	1
of	1
experience;	1
and	1
that	1
you	1
may	1
see	1
the	1
truth	1
of	1
this	1
and	1
grasp	1
it,	1
though	1
I	1
may	1
seem	1
to	1
put	1
myself	1
forward	1
without	1
being	1
asked,	1
I	1
will,	1
if	1
it	1
will	1
not	1
tire	1
you,	1
gentlemen,	1
and	1
you	1
will	1
give	1
me	1
your	1
attention	1
for	1
a	1
little,	1
tell	1
you	1
a	1
true	1
story	1
which	1
will	1
confirm	1
this	1
gentleman’s	1
word	1
(and	1
he	1
pointed	1
to	1
the	1
curate)	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
my	1
own.”	1
To	1
this	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
replied,	1
“Seeing	1
that	1
this	1
affair	1
has	1
a	1
certain	1
colour	1
of	1
chivalry	1
about	1
it,	1
I	1
for	1
my	1
part,	1
brother,	1
will	1
hear	1
you	1
most	1
gladly,	1
and	1
so	1
will	1
all	1
these	1
gentlemen,	1
from	1
the	1
high	1
intelligence	1
they	1
possess	1
and	1
their	1
love	1
of	1
curious	1
novelties	1
that	1
interest,	1
charm,	1
and	1
entertain	1
the	1
mind,	1
as	1
I	1
feel	1
quite	1
sure	1
your	1
story	1
will	1
do.	1
So	1
begin,	1
friend,	1
for	1
we	1
are	1
all	1
prepared	1
to	1
listen.”	1
“I	1
draw	1
my	1
stakes,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“and	1
will	1
retreat	1
with	1
this	1
pasty	1
to	1
the	1
brook	1
there,	1
where	1
I	1
mean	1
to	1
victual	1
myself	1
for	1
three	1
days;	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
heard	1
my	1
lord,	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
say	1
that	1
a	1
knight-errant’s	1
squire	1
should	1
eat	1
until	1
he	1
can	1
hold	1
no	1
more,	1
whenever	1
he	1
has	1
the	1
chance,	1
because	1
it	1
often	1
happens	1
them	1
to	1
get	1
by	1
accident	1
into	1
a	1
wood	1
so	1
thick	1
that	1
they	1
cannot	1
find	1
a	1
way	1
out	1
of	1
it	1
for	1
six	1
days;	1
and	1
if	1
the	1
man	1
is	1
not	1
well	1
filled	1
or	1
his	1
alforjas	1
well	1
stored,	1
there	1
he	1
may	1
stay,	1
as	1
very	1
often	1
he	1
does,	1
turned	1
into	1
a	1
dried	1
mummy.”	1
“Thou	1
art	1
in	1
the	1
right	1
of	1
it,	1
Sancho,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
“go	1
where	1
thou	1
wilt	1
and	1
eat	1
all	1
thou	1
canst,	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
had	1
enough,	1
and	1
only	1
want	1
to	1
give	1
my	1
mind	1
its	1
refreshment,	1
as	1
I	1
shall	1
by	1
listening	1
to	1
this	1
good	1
fellow’s	1
story.”	1
“It	1
is	1
what	1
we	1
shall	1
all	1
do,”	1
said	1
the	1
canon;	1
and	1
then	1
begged	1
the	1
goatherd	1
to	1
begin	1
the	1
promised	1
tale.	1
The	1
goatherd	1
gave	1
the	1
goat	1
which	1
he	1
held	1
by	1
the	1
horns	1
a	1
couple	1
of	1
slaps	1
on	1
the	1
back,	1
saying,	1
“Lie	1
down	1
here	1
beside	1
me,	1
Spotty,	1
for	1
we	1
have	1
time	1
enough	1
to	1
return	1
to	1
our	1
fold.”	1
The	1
goat	1
seemed	1
to	1
understand	1
him,	1
for	1
as	1
her	1
master	1
seated	1
himself,	1
she	1
stretched	1
herself	1
quietly	1
beside	1
him	1
and	1
looked	1
up	1
in	1
his	1
face	1
to	1
show	1
him	1
she	1
was	1
all	1
attention	1
to	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
going	1
to	1
say,	1
and	1
then	1
in	1
these	1
words	1
he	1
began	1
his	1
story.	1

Three	1
leagues	1
from	1
this	1
valley	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
village	1
which,	1
though	1
small,	1
is	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
richest	1
in	1
all	1
this	1
neighbourhood,	1
and	1
in	1
it	1
there	1
lived	1
a	1
farmer,	1
a	1
very	1
worthy	1
man,	1
and	1
so	1
much	1
respected	1
that,	1
although	1
to	1
be	1
so	1
is	1
the	1
natural	1
consequence	1
of	1
being	1
rich,	1
he	1
was	1
even	1
more	1
respected	1
for	1
his	1
virtue	1
than	1
for	1
the	1
wealth	1
he	1
had	1
acquired.	1
But	1
what	1
made	1
him	1
still	1
more	1
fortunate,	1
as	1
he	1
said	1
himself,	1
was	1
having	1
a	1
daughter	1
of	1
such	1
exceeding	1
beauty,	1
rare	1
intelligence,	1
gracefulness,	1
and	1
virtue,	1
that	1
everyone	1
who	1
knew	1
her	1
and	1
beheld	1
her	1
marvelled	1
at	1
the	1
extraordinary	1
gifts	1
with	1
which	1
heaven	1
and	1
nature	1
had	1
endowed	1
her.	1
As	1
a	1
child	1
she	1
was	1
beautiful,	1
she	1
continued	1
to	1
grow	1
in	1
beauty,	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
age	1
of	1
sixteen	1
she	1
was	1
most	1
lovely.	1
The	1
fame	1
of	1
her	1
beauty	1
began	1
to	1
spread	1
abroad	1
through	1
all	1
the	1
villages	1
around—but	1
why	1
do	1
I	1
say	1
the	1
villages	1
around,	1
merely,	1
when	1
it	1
spread	1
to	1
distant	1
cities,	1
and	1
even	1
made	1
its	1
way	1
into	1
the	1
halls	1
of	1
royalty	1
and	1
reached	1
the	1
ears	1
of	1
people	1
of	1
every	1
class,	1
who	1
came	1
from	1
all	1
sides	1
to	1
see	1
her	1
as	1
if	1
to	1
see	1
something	1
rare	1
and	1
curious,	1
or	1
some	1
wonder-working	1
image?	1
Her	1
father	1
watched	1
over	1
her	1
and	1
she	1
watched	1
over	1
herself;	1
for	1
there	1
are	1
no	1
locks,	1
or	1
guards,	1
or	1
bolts	1
that	1
can	1
protect	1
a	1
young	1
girl	1
better	1
than	1
her	1
own	1
modesty.	1
The	1
wealth	1
of	1
the	1
father	1
and	1
the	1
beauty	1
of	1
the	1
daughter	1
led	1
many	1
neighbours	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
strangers	1
to	1
seek	1
her	1
for	1
a	1
wife;	1
but	1
he,	1
as	1
one	1
might	1
well	1
be	1
who	1
had	1
the	1
disposal	1
of	1
so	1
rich	1
a	1
jewel,	1
was	1
perplexed	1
and	1
unable	1
to	1
make	1
up	1
his	1
mind	1
to	1
which	1
of	1
her	1
countless	1
suitors	1
he	1
should	1
entrust	1
her.	1
I	1
was	1
one	1
among	1
the	1
many	1
who	1
felt	1
a	1
desire	1
so	1
natural,	1
and,	1
as	1
her	1
father	1
knew	1
who	1
I	1
was,	1
and	1
I	1
was	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
town,	1
of	1
pure	1
blood,	1
in	1
the	1
bloom	1
of	1
life,	1
and	1
very	1
rich	1
in	1
possessions,	1
I	1
had	1
great	1
hopes	1
of	1
success.	1
There	1
was	1
another	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
place	1
and	1
qualifications	1
who	1
also	1
sought	1
her,	1
and	1
this	1
made	1
her	1
father’s	1
choice	1
hang	1
in	1
the	1
balance,	1
for	1
he	1
felt	1
that	1
on	1
either	1
of	1
us	1
his	1
daughter	1
would	1
be	1
well	1
bestowed;	1
so	1
to	1
escape	1
from	1
this	1
state	1
of	1
perplexity	1
he	1
resolved	1
to	1
refer	1
the	1
matter	1
to	1
Leandra	1
(for	1
that	1
is	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
rich	1
damsel	1
who	1
has	1
reduced	1
me	1
to	1
misery),	1
reflecting	1
that	1
as	1
we	1
were	1
both	1
equal	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
best	1
to	1
leave	1
it	1
to	1
his	1
dear	1
daughter	1
to	1
choose	1
according	1
to	1
her	1
inclination—a	1
course	1
that	1
is	1
worthy	1
of	1
imitation	1
by	1
all	1
fathers	1
who	1
wish	1
to	1
settle	1
their	1
children	1
in	1
life.	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
mean	1
that	1
they	1
ought	1
to	1
leave	1
them	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
choice	1
of	1
what	1
is	1
contemptible	1
and	1
bad,	1
but	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
place	1
before	1
them	1
what	1
is	1
good	1
and	1
then	1
allow	1
them	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
good	1
choice	1
as	1
they	1
please.	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
which	1
Leandra	1
chose;	1
I	1
only	1
know	1
her	1
father	1
put	1
us	1
both	1
off	1
with	1
the	1
tender	1
age	1
of	1
his	1
daughter	1
and	1
vague	1
words	1
that	1
neither	1
bound	1
him	1
nor	1
dismissed	1
us.	1
My	1
rival	1
is	1
called	1
Anselmo	1
and	1
I	1
myself	1
Eugenio—that	1
you	1
may	1
know	1
the	1
names	1
of	1
the	1
personages	1
that	1
figure	1
in	1
this	1
tragedy,	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
which	1
is	1
still	1
in	1
suspense,	1
though	1
it	1
is	1
plain	1
to	1
see	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
disastrous.	1
About	1
this	1
time	1
there	1
arrived	1
in	1
our	1
town	1
one	1
Vicente	1
de	1
la	1
Roca,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
a	1
poor	1
peasant	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
town,	1
the	1
said	1
Vicente	1
having	1
returned	1
from	1
service	1
as	1
a	1
soldier	1
in	1
Italy	1
and	1
divers	1
other	1
parts.	1
A	1
captain	1
who	1
chanced	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
way	1
with	1
his	1
company	1
had	1
carried	1
him	1
off	1
from	1
our	1
village	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
boy	1
of	1
about	1
twelve	1
years,	1
and	1
now	1
twelve	1
years	1
later	1
the	1
young	1
man	1
came	1
back	1
in	1
a	1
soldier’s	1
uniform,	1
arrayed	1
in	1
a	1
thousand	1
colours,	1
and	1
all	1
over	1
glass	1
trinkets	1
and	1
fine	1
steel	1
chains.	1
To-day	1
he	1
would	1
appear	1
in	1
one	1
gay	1
dress,	1
to-morrow	1
in	1
another;	1
but	1
all	1
flimsy	1
and	1
gaudy,	1
of	1
little	1
substance	1
and	1
less	1
worth.	1
The	1
peasant	1
folk,	1
who	1
are	1
naturally	1
malicious,	1
and	1
when	1
they	1
have	1
nothing	1
to	1
do	1
can	1
be	1
malice	1
itself,	1
remarked	1
all	1
this,	1
and	1
took	1
note	1
of	1
his	1
finery	1
and	1
jewellery,	1
piece	1
by	1
piece,	1
and	1
discovered	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
three	1
suits	1
of	1
different	1
colours,	1
with	1
garters	1
and	1
stockings	1
to	1
match;	1
but	1
he	1
made	1
so	1
many	1
arrangements	1
and	1
combinations	1
out	1
of	1
them,	1
that	1
if	1
they	1
had	1
not	1
counted	1
them,	1
anyone	1
would	1
have	1
sworn	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
made	1
a	1
display	1
of	1
more	1
than	1
ten	1
suits	1
of	1
clothes	1
and	1
twenty	1
plumes.	1
Do	1
not	1
look	1
upon	1
all	1
this	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
telling	1
you	1
about	1
the	1
clothes	1
as	1
uncalled	1
for	1
or	1
spun	1
out,	1
for	1
they	1
have	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
the	1
story.	1
He	1
used	1
to	1
seat	1
himself	1
on	1
a	1
bench	1
under	1
the	1
great	1
poplar	1
in	1
our	1
plaza,	1
and	1
there	1
he	1
would	1
keep	1
us	1
all	1
hanging	1
open-mouthed	1
on	1
the	1
stories	1
he	1
told	1
us	1
of	1
his	1
exploits.	1
There	1
was	1
no	1
country	1
on	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
globe	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
seen,	1
nor	1
battle	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
engaged	1
in;	1
he	1
had	1
killed	1
more	1
Moors	1
than	1
there	1
are	1
in	1
Morocco	1
and	1
Tunis,	1
and	1
fought	1
more	1
single	1
combats,	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
own	1
account,	1
than	1
Garcilaso,	1
Diego	1
García	1
de	1
Paredes	1
and	1
a	1
thousand	1
others	1
he	1
named,	1
and	1
out	1
of	1
all	1
he	1
had	1
come	1
victorious	1
without	1
losing	1
a	1
drop	1
of	1
blood.	1
On	1
the	1
other	1
hand	1
he	1
showed	1
marks	1
of	1
wounds,	1
which,	1
though	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
made	1
out,	1
he	1
said	1
were	1
gunshot	1
wounds	1
received	1
in	1
divers	1
encounters	1
and	1
actions.	1
Lastly,	1
with	1
monstrous	1
impudence	1
he	1
used	1
to	1
say	1
“you”	1
to	1
his	1
equals	1
and	1
even	1
those	1
who	1
knew	1
what	1
he	1
was,	1
and	1
declare	1
that	1
his	1
arm	1
was	1
his	1
father	1
and	1
his	1
deeds	1
his	1
pedigree,	1
and	1
that	1
being	1
a	1
soldier	1
he	1
was	1
as	1
good	1
as	1
the	1
king	1
himself.	1
And	1
to	1
add	1
to	1
these	1
swaggering	1
ways	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
trifle	1
of	1
a	1
musician,	1
and	1
played	1
the	1
guitar	1
with	1
such	1
a	1
flourish	1
that	1
some	1
said	1
he	1
made	1
it	1
speak;	1
nor	1
did	1
his	1
accomplishments	1
end	1
here,	1
for	1
he	1
was	1
something	1
of	1
a	1
poet	1
too,	1
and	1
on	1
every	1
trifle	1
that	1
happened	1
in	1
the	1
town	1
he	1
made	1
a	1
ballad	1
a	1
league	1
long.	1

This	1
soldier,	1
then,	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
described,	1
this	1
Vicente	1
de	1
la	1
Roca,	1
this	1
bravo,	1
gallant,	1
musician,	1
poet,	1
was	1
often	1
seen	1
and	1
watched	1
by	1
Leandra	1
from	1
a	1
window	1
of	1
her	1
house	1
which	1
looked	1
out	1
on	1
the	1
plaza.	1
The	1
glitter	1
of	1
his	1
showy	1
attire	1
took	1
her	1
fancy,	1
his	1
ballads	1
bewitched	1
her	1
(for	1
he	1
gave	1
away	1
twenty	1
copies	1
of	1
every	1
one	1
he	1
made),	1
the	1
tales	1
of	1
his	1
exploits	1
which	1
he	1
told	1
about	1
himself	1
came	1
to	1
her	1
ears;	1
and	1
in	1
short,	1
as	1
the	1
devil	1
no	1
doubt	1
had	1
arranged	1
it,	1
she	1
fell	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
him	1
before	1
the	1
presumption	1
of	1
making	1
love	1
to	1
her	1
had	1
suggested	1
itself	1
to	1
him;	1
and	1
as	1
in	1
love-affairs	1
none	1
are	1
more	1
easily	1
brought	1
to	1
an	1
issue	1
than	1
those	1
which	1
have	1
the	1
inclination	1
of	1
the	1
lady	1
for	1
an	1
ally,	1
Leandra	1
and	1
Vicente	1
came	1
to	1
an	1
understanding	1
without	1
any	1
difficulty;	1
and	1
before	1
any	1
of	1
her	1
numerous	1
suitors	1
had	1
any	1
suspicion	1
of	1
her	1
design,	1
she	1
had	1
already	1
carried	1
it	1
into	1
effect,	1
having	1
left	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
her	1
dearly	1
beloved	1
father	1
(for	1
mother	1
she	1
had	1
none),	1
and	1
disappeared	1
from	1
the	1
village	1
with	1
the	1
soldier,	1
who	1
came	1
more	1
triumphantly	1
out	1
of	1
this	1
enterprise	1
than	1
out	1
of	1
any	1
of	1
the	1
large	1
number	1
he	1
laid	1
claim	1
to.	1
All	1
the	1
village	1
and	1
all	1
who	1
heard	1
of	1
it	1
were	1
amazed	1
at	1
the	1
affair;	1
I	1
was	1
aghast,	1
Anselmo	1
thunderstruck,	1
her	1
father	1
full	1
of	1
grief,	1
her	1
relations	1
indignant,	1
the	1
authorities	1
all	1
in	1
a	1
ferment,	1
the	1
officers	1
of	1
the	1
Brotherhood	1
in	1
arms.	1
They	1
scoured	1
the	1
roads,	1
they	1
searched	1
the	1
woods	1
and	1
all	1
quarters,	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
three	1
days	1
they	1
found	1
the	1
flighty	1
Leandra	1
in	1
a	1
mountain	1
cave,	1
stript	1
to	1
her	1
shift,	1
and	1
robbed	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
money	1
and	1
precious	1
jewels	1
she	1
had	1
carried	1
away	1
from	1
home	1
with	1
her.	1

They	1
brought	1
her	1
back	1
to	1
her	1
unhappy	1
father,	1
and	1
questioned	1
her	1
as	1
to	1
her	1
misfortune,	1
and	1
she	1
confessed	1
without	1
pressure	1
that	1
Vicente	1
de	1
la	1
Roca	1
had	1
deceived	1
her,	1
and	1
under	1
promise	1
of	1
marrying	1
her	1
had	1
induced	1
her	1
to	1
leave	1
her	1
father’s	1
house,	1
as	1
he	1
meant	1
to	1
take	1
her	1
to	1
the	1
richest	1
and	1
most	1
delightful	1
city	1
in	1
the	1
whole	1
world,	1
which	1
was	1
Naples;	1
and	1
that	1
she,	1
ill-advised	1
and	1
deluded,	1
had	1
believed	1
him,	1
and	1
robbed	1
her	1
father,	1
and	1
handed	1
over	1
all	1
to	1
him	1
the	1
night	1
she	1
disappeared;	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
carried	1
her	1
away	1
to	1
a	1
rugged	1
mountain	1
and	1
shut	1
her	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
cave	1
where	1
they	1
had	1
found	1
her.	1
She	1
said,	1
moreover,	1
that	1
the	1
soldier,	1
without	1
robbing	1
her	1
of	1
her	1
honour,	1
had	1
taken	1
from	1
her	1
everything	1
she	1
had,	1
and	1
made	1
off,	1
leaving	1
her	1
in	1
the	1
cave,	1
a	1
thing	1
that	1
still	1
further	1
surprised	1
everybody.	1
It	1
was	1
not	1
easy	1
for	1
us	1
to	1
credit	1
the	1
young	1
man’s	1
continence,	1
but	1
she	1
asserted	1
it	1
with	1
such	1
earnestness	1
that	1
it	1
helped	1
to	1
console	1
her	1
distressed	1
father,	1
who	1
thought	1
nothing	1
of	1
what	1
had	1
been	1
taken	1
since	1
the	1
jewel	1
that	1
once	1
lost	1
can	1
never	1
be	1
recovered	1
had	1
been	1
left	1
to	1
his	1
daughter.	1
The	1
same	1
day	1
that	1
Leandra	1
made	1
her	1
appearance	1
her	1
father	1
removed	1
her	1
from	1
our	1
sight	1
and	1
took	1
her	1
away	1
to	1
shut	1
her	1
up	1
in	1
a	1
convent	1
in	1
a	1
town	1
near	1
this,	1
in	1
the	1
hope	1
that	1
time	1
may	1
wear	1
away	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
disgrace	1
she	1
has	1
incurred.	1
Leandra’s	1
youth	1
furnished	1
an	1
excuse	1
for	1
her	1
fault,	1
at	1
least	1
with	1
those	1
to	1
whom	1
it	1
was	1
of	1
no	1
consequence	1
whether	1
she	1
was	1
good	1
or	1
bad;	1
but	1
those	1
who	1
knew	1
her	1
shrewdness	1
and	1
intelligence	1
did	1
not	1
attribute	1
her	1
misdemeanour	1
to	1
ignorance	1
but	1
to	1
wantonness	1
and	1
the	1
natural	1
disposition	1
of	1
women,	1
which	1
is	1
for	1
the	1
most	1
part	1
flighty	1
and	1
ill-regulated.	1
Leandra	1
withdrawn	1
from	1
sight,	1
Anselmo’s	1
eyes	1
grew	1
blind,	1
or	1
at	1
any	1
rate	1
found	1
nothing	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
that	1
gave	1
them	1
any	1
pleasure,	1
and	1
mine	1
were	1
in	1
darkness	1
without	1
a	1
ray	1
of	1
light	1
to	1
direct	1
them	1
to	1
anything	1
enjoyable	1
while	1
Leandra	1
was	1
away.	1
Our	1
melancholy	1
grew	1
greater,	1
our	1
patience	1
grew	1
less;	1
we	1
cursed	1
the	1
soldier’s	1
finery	1
and	1
railed	1
at	1
the	1
carelessness	1
of	1
Leandra’s	1
father.	1
At	1
last	1
Anselmo	1
and	1
I	1
agreed	1
to	1
leave	1
the	1
village	1
and	1
come	1
to	1
this	1
valley;	1
and,	1
he	1
feeding	1
a	1
great	1
flock	1
of	1
sheep	1
of	1
his	1
own,	1
and	1
I	1
a	1
large	1
herd	1
of	1
goats	1
of	1
mine,	1
we	1
pass	1
our	1
life	1
among	1
the	1
trees,	1
giving	1
vent	1
to	1
our	1
sorrows,	1
together	1
singing	1
the	1
fair	1
Leandra’s	1
praises,	1
or	1
upbraiding	1
her,	1
or	1
else	1
sighing	1
alone,	1
and	1
to	1
heaven	1
pouring	1
forth	1
our	1
complaints	1
in	1
solitude.	1
Following	1
our	1
example,	1
many	1
more	1
of	1
Leandra’s	1
lovers	1
have	1
come	1
to	1
these	1
rude	1
mountains	1
and	1
adopted	1
our	1
mode	1
of	1
life,	1
and	1
they	1
are	1
so	1
numerous	1
that	1
one	1
would	1
fancy	1
the	1
place	1
had	1
been	1
turned	1
into	1
the	1
pastoral	1
Arcadia,	1
so	1
full	1
is	1
it	1
of	1
shepherds	1
and	1
sheep-folds;	1
nor	1
is	1
there	1
a	1
spot	1
in	1
it	1
where	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
fair	1
Leandra	1
is	1
not	1
heard.	1
Here	1
one	1
curses	1
her	1
and	1
calls	1
her	1
capricious,	1
fickle,	1
and	1
immodest,	1
there	1
another	1
condemns	1
her	1
as	1
frail	1
and	1
frivolous;	1
this	1
pardons	1
and	1
absolves	1
her,	1
that	1
spurns	1
and	1
reviles	1
her;	1
one	1
extols	1
her	1
beauty,	1
another	1
assails	1
her	1
character,	1
and	1
in	1
short	1
all	1
abuse	1
her,	1
and	1
all	1
adore	1
her,	1
and	1
to	1
such	1
a	1
pitch	1
has	1
this	1
general	1
infatuation	1
gone	1
that	1
there	1
are	1
some	1
who	1
complain	1
of	1
her	1
scorn	1
without	1
ever	1
having	1
exchanged	1
a	1
word	1
with	1
her,	1
and	1
even	1
some	1
that	1
bewail	1
and	1
mourn	1
the	1
raging	1
fever	1
of	1
jealousy,	1
for	1
which	1
she	1
never	1
gave	1
anyone	1
cause,	1
for,	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
already	1
said,	1
her	1
misconduct	1
was	1
known	1
before	1
her	1
passion.	1
There	1
is	1
no	1
nook	1
among	1
the	1
rocks,	1
no	1
brookside,	1
no	1
shade	1
beneath	1
the	1
trees	1
that	1
is	1
not	1
haunted	1
by	1
some	1
shepherd	1
telling	1
his	1
woes	1
to	1
the	1
breezes;	1
wherever	1
there	1
is	1
an	1
echo	1
it	1
repeats	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Leandra;	1
the	1
mountains	1
ring	1
with	1
“Leandra,”	1
“Leandra”	1
murmur	1
the	1
brooks,	1
and	1
Leandra	1
keeps	1
us	1
all	1
bewildered	1
and	1
bewitched,	1
hoping	1
without	1
hope	1
and	1
fearing	1
without	1
knowing	1
what	1
we	1
fear.	1
Of	1
all	1
this	1
silly	1
set	1
the	1
one	1
that	1
shows	1
the	1
least	1
and	1
also	1
the	1
most	1
sense	1
is	1
my	1
rival	1
Anselmo,	1
for	1
having	1
so	1
many	1
other	1
things	1
to	1
complain	1
of,	1
he	1
only	1
complains	1
of	1
separation,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
accompaniment	1
of	1
a	1
rebeck,	1
which	1
he	1
plays	1
admirably,	1
he	1
sings	1
his	1
complaints	1
in	1
verses	1
that	1
show	1
his	1
ingenuity.	1
I	1
follow	1
another,	1
easier,	1
and	1
to	1
my	1
mind	1
wiser	1
course,	1
and	1
that	1
is	1
to	1
rail	1
at	1
the	1
frivolity	1
of	1
women,	1
at	1
their	1
inconstancy,	1
their	1
double	1
dealing,	1
their	1
broken	1
promises,	1
their	1
unkept	1
pledges,	1
and	1
in	1
short	1
the	1
want	1
of	1
reflection	1
they	1
show	1
in	1
fixing	1
their	1
affections	1
and	1
inclinations.	1
This,	1
sirs,	1
was	1
the	1
reason	1
of	1
words	1
and	1
expressions	1
I	1
made	1
use	1
of	1
to	1
this	1
goat	1
when	1
I	1
came	1
up	1
just	1
now;	1
for	1
as	1
she	1
is	1
a	1
female	1
I	1
have	1
a	1
contempt	1
for	1
her,	1
though	1
she	1
is	1
the	1
best	1
in	1
all	1
my	1
fold.	1
This	1
is	1
the	1
story	1
I	1
promised	1
to	1
tell	1
you,	1
and	1
if	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
tedious	1
in	1
telling	1
it,	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
slow	1
to	1
serve	1
you;	1
my	1
hut	1
is	1
close	1
by,	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
fresh	1
milk	1
and	1
dainty	1
cheese	1
there,	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
a	1
variety	1
of	1
toothsome	1
fruit,	1
no	1
less	1
pleasing	1
to	1
the	1
eye	1
than	1
to	1
the	1
palate.	1

The	1
goatherd’s	1
tale	1
gave	1
great	1
satisfaction	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
hearers,	1
and	1
the	1
canon	1
especially	1
enjoyed	1
it,	1
for	1
he	1
had	1
remarked	1
with	1
particular	1
attention	1
the	1
manner	1
in	1
which	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
told,	1
which	1
was	1
as	1
unlike	1
the	1
manner	1
of	1
a	1
clownish	1
goatherd	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
like	1
that	1
of	1
a	1
polished	1
city	1
wit;	1
and	1
he	1
observed	1
that	1
the	1
curate	1
had	1
been	1
quite	1
right	1
in	1
saying	1
that	1
the	1
woods	1
bred	1
men	1
of	1
learning.	1
They	1
all	1
offered	1
their	1
services	1
to	1
Eugenio	1
but	1
he	1
who	1
showed	1
himself	1
most	1
liberal	1
in	1
this	1
way	1
was	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
who	1
said	1
to	1
him,	1
“Most	1
assuredly,	1
brother	1
goatherd,	1
if	1
I	1
found	1
myself	1
in	1
a	1
position	1
to	1
attempt	1
any	1
adventure,	1
I	1
would,	1
this	1
very	1
instant,	1
set	1
out	1
on	1
your	1
behalf,	1
and	1
would	1
rescue	1
Leandra	1
from	1
that	1
convent	1
(where	1
no	1
doubt	1
she	1
is	1
kept	1
against	1
her	1
will),	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
the	1
abbess	1
and	1
all	1
who	1
might	1
try	1
to	1
prevent	1
me,	1
and	1
would	1
place	1
her	1
in	1
your	1
hands	1
to	1
deal	1
with	1
her	1
according	1
to	1
your	1
will	1
and	1
pleasure,	1
observing,	1
however,	1
the	1
laws	1
of	1
chivalry	1
which	1
lay	1
down	1
that	1
no	1
violence	1
of	1
any	1
kind	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
offered	1
to	1
any	1
damsel.	1
But	1
I	1
trust	1
in	1
God	1
our	1
Lord	1
that	1
the	1
might	1
of	1
one	1
malignant	1
enchanter	1
may	1
not	1
prove	1
so	1
great	1
but	1
that	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
another	1
better	1
disposed	1
may	1
prove	1
superior	1
to	1
it,	1
and	1
then	1
I	1
promise	1
you	1
my	1
support	1
and	1
assistance,	1
as	1
I	1
am	1
bound	1
to	1
do	1
by	1
my	1
profession,	1
which	1
is	1
none	1
other	1
than	1
to	1
give	1
aid	1
to	1
the	1
weak	1
and	1
needy.”	1
The	1
goatherd	1
eyed	1
him,	1
and	1
noticing	1
Don	1
Quixote’s	1
sorry	1
appearance	1
and	1
looks,	1
he	1
was	1
filled	1
with	1
wonder,	1
and	1
asked	1
the	1
barber,	1
who	1
was	1
next	1
him,	1
“Señor,	1
who	1
is	1
this	1
man	1
who	1
makes	1
such	1
a	1
figure	1
and	1
talks	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
strain?”	1
“Who	1
should	1
it	1
be,”	1
said	1
the	1
barber,	1
“but	1
the	1
famous	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
of	1
La	1
Mancha,	1
the	1
undoer	1
of	1
injustice,	1
the	1
righter	1
of	1
wrongs,	1
the	1
protector	1
of	1
damsels,	1
the	1
terror	1
of	1
giants,	1
and	1
the	1
winner	1
of	1
battles?”	1
“That,”	1
said	1
the	1
goatherd,	1
“sounds	1
like	1
what	1
one	1
reads	1
in	1
the	1
books	1
of	1
the	1
knights-errant,	1
who	1
did	1
all	1
that	1
you	1
say	1
this	1
man	1
does;	1
though	1
it	1
is	1
my	1
belief	1
that	1
either	1
you	1
are	1
joking,	1
or	1
else	1
this	1
gentleman	1
has	1
empty	1
lodgings	1
in	1
his	1
head.”	1
“You	1
are	1
a	1
great	1
scoundrel,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“and	1
it	1
is	1
you	1
who	1
are	1
empty	1
and	1
a	1
fool.	1
I	1
am	1
fuller	1
than	1
ever	1
was	1
the	1
whoreson	1
bitch	1
that	1
bore	1
you;”	1
and	1
passing	1
from	1
words	1
to	1
deeds,	1
he	1
caught	1
up	1
a	1
loaf	1
that	1
was	1
near	1
him	1
and	1
sent	1
it	1
full	1
in	1
the	1
goatherd’s	1
face,	1
with	1
such	1
force	1
that	1
he	1
flattened	1
his	1
nose;	1
but	1
the	1
goatherd,	1
who	1
did	1
not	1
understand	1
jokes,	1
and	1
found	1
himself	1
roughly	1
handled	1
in	1
such	1
good	1
earnest,	1
paying	1
no	1
respect	1
to	1
carpet,	1
tablecloth,	1
or	1
diners,	1
sprang	1
upon	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
and	1
seizing	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
throat	1
with	1
both	1
hands	1
would	1
no	1
doubt	1
have	1
throttled	1
him,	1
had	1
not	1
Sancho	1
Panza	1
that	1
instant	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
rescue,	1
and	1
grasping	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
shoulders	1
flung	1
him	1
down	1
on	1
the	1
table,	1
smashing	1
plates,	1
breaking	1
glasses,	1
and	1
upsetting	1
and	1
scattering	1
everything	1
on	1
it.	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
finding	1
himself	1
free,	1
strove	1
to	1
get	1
on	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
goatherd,	1
who,	1
with	1
his	1
face	1
covered	1
with	1
blood,	1
and	1
soundly	1
kicked	1
by	1
Sancho,	1
was	1
on	1
all	1
fours	1
feeling	1
about	1
for	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
table-knives	1
to	1
take	1
a	1
bloody	1
revenge	1
with.	1
The	1
canon	1
and	1
the	1
curate,	1
however,	1
prevented	1
him,	1
but	1
the	1
barber	1
so	1
contrived	1
it	1
that	1
he	1
got	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
under	1
him,	1
and	1
rained	1
down	1
upon	1
him	1
such	1
a	1
shower	1
of	1
fisticuffs	1
that	1
the	1
poor	1
knight’s	1
face	1
streamed	1
with	1
blood	1
as	1
freely	1
as	1
his	1
own.	1
The	1
canon	1
and	1
the	1
curate	1
were	1
bursting	1
with	1
laughter,	1
the	1
officers	1
were	1
capering	1
with	1
delight,	1
and	1
both	1
the	1
one	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
hissed	1
them	1
on	1
as	1
they	1
do	1
dogs	1
that	1
are	1
worrying	1
one	1
another	1
in	1
a	1
fight.	1
Sancho	1
alone	1
was	1
frantic,	1
for	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
free	1
himself	1
from	1
the	1
grasp	1
of	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
canon’s	1
servants,	1
who	1
kept	1
him	1
from	1
going	1
to	1
his	1
master’s	1
assistance.	1

At	1
last,	1
while	1
they	1
were	1
all,	1
with	1
the	1
exception	1
of	1
the	1
two	1
bruisers	1
who	1
were	1
mauling	1
each	1
other,	1
in	1
high	1
glee	1
and	1
enjoyment,	1
they	1
heard	1
a	1
trumpet	1
sound	1
a	1
note	1
so	1
doleful	1
that	1
it	1
made	1
them	1
all	1
look	1
in	1
the	1
direction	1
whence	1
the	1
sound	1
seemed	1
to	1
come.	1
But	1
the	1
one	1
that	1
was	1
most	1
excited	1
by	1
hearing	1
it	1
was	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
who	1
though	1
sorely	1
against	1
his	1
will	1
he	1
was	1
under	1
the	1
goatherd,	1
and	1
something	1
more	1
than	1
pretty	1
well	1
pummelled,	1
said	1
to	1
him,	1
“Brother	1
devil	1
(for	1
it	1
is	1
impossible	1
but	1
that	1
thou	1
must	1
be	1
one	1
since	1
thou	1
hast	1
had	1
might	1
and	1
strength	1
enough	1
to	1
overcome	1
mine),	1
I	1
ask	1
thee	1
to	1
agree	1
to	1
a	1
truce	1
for	1
but	1
one	1
hour	1
for	1
the	1
solemn	1
note	1
of	1
yonder	1
trumpet	1
that	1
falls	1
on	1
our	1
ears	1
seems	1
to	1
me	1
to	1
summon	1
me	1
to	1
some	1
new	1
adventure.”	1
The	1
goatherd,	1
who	1
was	1
by	1
this	1
time	1
tired	1
of	1
pummelling	1
and	1
being	1
pummelled,	1
released	1
him	1
at	1
once,	1
and	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
rising	1
to	1
his	1
feet	1
and	1
turning	1
his	1
eyes	1
to	1
the	1
quarter	1
where	1
the	1
sound	1
had	1
been	1
heard,	1
suddenly	1
saw	1
coming	1
down	1
the	1
slope	1
of	1
a	1
hill	1
several	1
men	1
clad	1
in	1
white	1
like	1
penitents.	1
The	1
fact	1
was	1
that	1
the	1
clouds	1
had	1
that	1
year	1
withheld	1
their	1
moisture	1
from	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
villages	1
of	1
the	1
district	1
they	1
were	1
organising	1
processions,	1
rogations,	1
and	1
penances,	1
imploring	1
God	1
to	1
open	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
his	1
mercy	1
and	1
send	1
the	1
rain;	1
and	1
to	1
this	1
end	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
a	1
village	1
that	1
was	1
hard	1
by	1
were	1
going	1
in	1
procession	1
to	1
a	1
holy	1
hermitage	1
there	1
was	1
on	1
one	1
side	1
of	1
that	1
valley.	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
the	1
strange	1
garb	1
of	1
the	1
penitents,	1
without	1
reflecting	1
how	1
often	1
he	1
had	1
seen	1
it	1
before,	1
took	1
it	1
into	1
his	1
head	1
that	1
this	1
was	1
a	1
case	1
of	1
adventure,	1
and	1
that	1
it	1
fell	1
to	1
him	1
alone	1
as	1
a	1
knight-errant	1
to	1
engage	1
in	1
it;	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
all	1
the	1
more	1
confirmed	1
in	1
this	1
notion,	1
by	1
the	1
idea	1
that	1
an	1
image	1
draped	1
in	1
black	1
they	1
had	1
with	1
them	1
was	1
some	1
illustrious	1
lady	1
that	1
these	1
villains	1
and	1
discourteous	1
thieves	1
were	1
carrying	1
off	1
by	1
force.	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
this	1
occurred	1
to	1
him	1
he	1
ran	1
with	1
all	1
speed	1
to	1
Rocinante	1
who	1
was	1
grazing	1
at	1
large,	1
and	1
taking	1
the	1
bridle	1
and	1
the	1
buckler	1
from	1
the	1
saddle-bow,	1
he	1
had	1
him	1
bridled	1
in	1
an	1
instant,	1
and	1
calling	1
to	1
Sancho	1
for	1
his	1
sword	1
he	1
mounted	1
Rocinante,	1
braced	1
his	1
buckler	1
on	1
his	1
arm,	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
loud	1
voice	1
exclaimed	1
to	1
those	1
who	1
stood	1
by,	1
“Now,	1
noble	1
company,	1
ye	1
shall	1
see	1
how	1
important	1
it	1
is	1
that	1
there	1
should	1
be	1
knights	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
professing	1
the	1
order	1
of	1
knight-errantry;	1
now,	1
I	1
say,	1
ye	1
shall	1
see,	1
by	1
the	1
deliverance	1
of	1
that	1
worthy	1
lady	1
who	1
is	1
borne	1
captive	1
there,	1
whether	1
knights-errant	1
deserve	1
to	1
be	1
held	1
in	1
estimation,”	1
and	1
so	1
saying	1
he	1
brought	1
his	1
legs	1
to	1
bear	1
on	1
Rocinante—for	1
he	1
had	1
no	1
spurs—and	1
at	1
a	1
full	1
canter	1
(for	1
in	1
all	1
this	1
veracious	1
history	1
we	1
never	1
read	1
of	1
Rocinante	1
fairly	1
galloping)	1
set	1
off	1
to	1
encounter	1
the	1
penitents,	1
though	1
the	1
curate,	1
the	1
canon,	1
and	1
the	1
barber	1
ran	1
to	1
prevent	1
him.	1
But	1
it	1
was	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
power,	1
nor	1
did	1
he	1
even	1
stop	1
for	1
the	1
shouts	1
of	1
Sancho	1
calling	1
after	1
him,	1
“Where	1
are	1
you	1
going,	1
Señor	1
Don	1
Quixote?	1
What	1
devils	1
have	1
possessed	1
you	1
to	1
set	1
you	1
on	1
against	1
our	1
Catholic	1
faith?	1
Plague	1
take	1
me!	1
mind,	1
that	1
is	1
a	1
procession	1
of	1
penitents,	1
and	1
the	1
lady	1
they	1
are	1
carrying	1
on	1
that	1
stand	1
there	1
is	1
the	1
blessed	1
image	1
of	1
the	1
immaculate	1
Virgin.	1
Take	1
care	1
what	1
you	1
are	1
doing,	1
señor,	1
for	1
this	1
time	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
safely	1
said	1
you	1
don’t	1
know	1
what	1
you	1
are	1
about.”	1
Sancho	1
laboured	1
in	1
vain,	1
for	1
his	1
master	1
was	1
so	1
bent	1
on	1
coming	1
to	1
quarters	1
with	1
these	1
sheeted	1
figures	1
and	1
releasing	1
the	1
lady	1
in	1
black	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
hear	1
a	1
word;	1
and	1
even	1
had	1
he	1
heard,	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
turned	1
back	1
if	1
the	1
king	1
had	1
ordered	1
him.	1
He	1
came	1
up	1
with	1
the	1
procession	1
and	1
reined	1
in	1
Rocinante,	1
who	1
was	1
already	1
anxious	1
enough	1
to	1
slacken	1
speed	1
a	1
little,	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
hoarse,	1
excited	1
voice	1
he	1
exclaimed,	1
“You	1
who	1
hide	1
your	1
faces,	1
perhaps	1
because	1
you	1
are	1
not	1
good	1
subjects,	1
pay	1
attention	1
and	1
listen	1
to	1
what	1
I	1
am	1
about	1
to	1
say	1
to	1
you.”	1
The	1
first	1
to	1
halt	1
were	1
those	1
who	1
were	1
carrying	1
the	1
image,	1
and	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
four	1
ecclesiastics	1
who	1
were	1
chanting	1
the	1
Litany,	1
struck	1
by	1
the	1
strange	1
figure	1
of	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
the	1
leanness	1
of	1
Rocinante,	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
ludicrous	1
peculiarities	1
he	1
observed,	1
said	1
in	1
reply	1
to	1
him,	1
“Brother,	1
if	1
you	1
have	1
anything	1
to	1
say	1
to	1
us	1
say	1
it	1
quickly,	1
for	1
these	1
brethren	1
are	1
whipping	1
themselves,	1
and	1
we	1
cannot	1
stop,	1
nor	1
is	1
it	1
reasonable	1
we	1
should	1
stop	1
to	1
hear	1
anything,	1
unless	1
indeed	1
it	1
is	1
short	1
enough	1
to	1
be	1
said	1
in	1
two	1
words.”	1
“I	1
will	1
say	1
it	1
in	1
one,”	1
replied	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“and	1
it	1
is	1
this;	1
that	1
at	1
once,	1
this	1
very	1
instant,	1
ye	1
release	1
that	1
fair	1
lady	1
whose	1
tears	1
and	1
sad	1
aspect	1
show	1
plainly	1
that	1
ye	1
are	1
carrying	1
her	1
off	1
against	1
her	1
will,	1
and	1
that	1
ye	1
have	1
committed	1
some	1
scandalous	1
outrage	1
against	1
her;	1
and	1
I,	1
who	1
was	1
born	1
into	1
the	1
world	1
to	1
redress	1
all	1
such	1
like	1
wrongs,	1
will	1
not	1
permit	1
you	1
to	1
advance	1
another	1
step	1
until	1
you	1
have	1
restored	1
to	1
her	1
the	1
liberty	1
she	1
pines	1
for	1
and	1
deserves.”	1
From	1
these	1
words	1
all	1
the	1
hearers	1
concluded	1
that	1
he	1
must	1
be	1
a	1
madman,	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
laugh	1
heartily,	1
and	1
their	1
laughter	1
acted	1
like	1
gunpowder	1
on	1
Don	1
Quixote’s	1
fury,	1
for	1
drawing	1
his	1
sword	1
without	1
another	1
word	1
he	1
made	1
a	1
rush	1
at	1
the	1
stand.	1
One	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
supported	1
it,	1
leaving	1
the	1
burden	1
to	1
his	1
comrades,	1
advanced	1
to	1
meet	1
him,	1
flourishing	1
a	1
forked	1
stick	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
for	1
propping	1
up	1
the	1
stand	1
when	1
resting,	1
and	1
with	1
this	1
he	1
caught	1
a	1
mighty	1
cut	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
made	1
at	1
him	1
that	1
severed	1
it	1
in	1
two;	1
but	1
with	1
the	1
portion	1
that	1
remained	1
in	1
his	1
hand	1
he	1
dealt	1
such	1
a	1
thwack	1
on	1
the	1
shoulder	1
of	1
Don	1
Quixote’s	1
sword	1
arm	1
(which	1
the	1
buckler	1
could	1
not	1
protect	1
against	1
the	1
clownish	1
assault)	1
that	1
poor	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
ground	1
in	1
a	1
sad	1
plight.	1
Sancho	1
Panza,	1
who	1
was	1
coming	1
on	1
close	1
behind	1
puffing	1
and	1
blowing,	1
seeing	1
him	1
fall,	1
cried	1
out	1
to	1
his	1
assailant	1
not	1
to	1
strike	1
him	1
again,	1
for	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
poor	1
enchanted	1
knight,	1
who	1
had	1
never	1
harmed	1
anyone	1
all	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
his	1
life;	1
but	1
what	1
checked	1
the	1
clown	1
was,	1
not	1
Sancho’s	1
shouting,	1
but	1
seeing	1
that	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
did	1
not	1
stir	1
hand	1
or	1
foot;	1
and	1
so,	1
fancying	1
he	1
had	1
killed	1
him,	1
he	1
hastily	1
hitched	1
up	1
his	1
tunic	1
under	1
his	1
girdle	1
and	1
took	1
to	1
his	1
heels	1
across	1
the	1
country	1
like	1
a	1
deer.	1
By	1
this	1
time	1
all	1
Don	1
Quixote’s	1
companions	1
had	1
come	1
up	1
to	1
where	1
he	1
lay;	1
but	1
the	1
processionists	1
seeing	1
them	1
come	1
running,	1
and	1
with	1
them	1
the	1
officers	1
of	1
the	1
Brotherhood	1
with	1
their	1
crossbows,	1
apprehended	1
mischief,	1
and	1
clustering	1
round	1
the	1
image,	1
raised	1
their	1
hoods,	1
and	1
grasped	1
their	1
scourges,	1
as	1
the	1
priests	1
did	1
their	1
tapers,	1
and	1
awaited	1
the	1
attack,	1
resolved	1
to	1
defend	1
themselves	1
and	1
even	1
to	1
take	1
the	1
offensive	1
against	1
their	1
assailants	1
if	1
they	1
could.	1
Fortune,	1
however,	1
arranged	1
the	1
matter	1
better	1
than	1
they	1
expected,	1
for	1
all	1
Sancho	1
did	1
was	1
to	1
fling	1
himself	1
on	1
his	1
master’s	1
body,	1
raising	1
over	1
him	1
the	1
most	1
doleful	1
and	1
laughable	1
lamentation	1
that	1
ever	1
was	1
heard,	1
for	1
he	1
believed	1
he	1
was	1
dead.	1
The	1
curate	1
was	1
known	1
to	1
another	1
curate	1
who	1
walked	1
in	1
the	1
procession,	1
and	1
their	1
recognition	1
of	1
one	1
another	1
set	1
at	1
rest	1
the	1
apprehensions	1
of	1
both	1
parties;	1
the	1
first	1
then	1
told	1
the	1
other	1
in	1
two	1
words	1
who	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
was,	1
and	1
he	1
and	1
the	1
whole	1
troop	1
of	1
penitents	1
went	1
to	1
see	1
if	1
the	1
poor	1
gentleman	1
was	1
dead,	1
and	1
heard	1
Sancho	1
Panza	1
saying,	1
with	1
tears	1
in	1
his	1
eyes,	1
“Oh	1
flower	1
of	1
chivalry,	1
that	1
with	1
one	1
blow	1
of	1
a	1
stick	1
hast	1
ended	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
thy	1
well-spent	1
life!	1
Oh	1
pride	1
of	1
thy	1
race,	1
honour	1
and	1
glory	1
of	1
all	1
La	1
Mancha,	1
nay,	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
world,	1
that	1
for	1
want	1
of	1
thee	1
will	1
be	1
full	1
of	1
evil-doers,	1
no	1
longer	1
in	1
fear	1
of	1
punishment	1
for	1
their	1
misdeeds!	1
Oh	1
thou,	1
generous	1
above	1
all	1
the	1
Alexanders,	1
since	1
for	1
only	1
eight	1
months	1
of	1
service	1
thou	1
hast	1
given	1
me	1
the	1
best	1
island	1
the	1
sea	1
girds	1
or	1
surrounds!	1
Humble	1
with	1
the	1
proud,	1
haughty	1
with	1
the	1
humble,	1
encounterer	1
of	1
dangers,	1
endurer	1
of	1
outrages,	1
enamoured	1
without	1
reason,	1
imitator	1
of	1
the	1
good,	1
scourge	1
of	1
the	1
wicked,	1
enemy	1
of	1
the	1
mean,	1
in	1
short,	1
knight-errant,	1
which	1
is	1
all	1
that	1
can	1
be	1
said!”	1

At	1
the	1
cries	1
and	1
moans	1
of	1
Sancho,	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
came	1
to	1
himself,	1
and	1
the	1
first	1
word	1
he	1
said	1
was,	1
“He	1
who	1
lives	1
separated	1
from	1
you,	1
sweetest	1
Dulcinea,	1
has	1
greater	1
miseries	1
to	1
endure	1
than	1
these.	1
Aid	1
me,	1
friend	1
Sancho,	1
to	1
mount	1
the	1
enchanted	1
cart,	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
in	1
a	1
condition	1
to	1
press	1
the	1
saddle	1
of	1
Rocinante,	1
as	1
this	1
shoulder	1
is	1
all	1
knocked	1
to	1
pieces.”	1
“That	1
I	1
will	1
do	1
with	1
all	1
my	1
heart,	1
señor,”	1
said	1
Sancho;	1
“and	1
let	1
us	1
return	1
to	1
our	1
village	1
with	1
these	1
gentlemen,	1
who	1
seek	1
your	1
good,	1
and	1
there	1
we	1
will	1
prepare	1
for	1
making	1
another	1
sally,	1
which	1
may	1
turn	1
out	1
more	1
profitable	1
and	1
creditable	1
to	1
us.”	1
“Thou	1
art	1
right,	1
Sancho,”	1
returned	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
“It	1
will	1
be	1
wise	1
to	1
let	1
the	1
malign	1
influence	1
of	1
the	1
stars	1
which	1
now	1
prevails	1
pass	1
off.”	1
The	1
canon,	1
the	1
curate,	1
and	1
the	1
barber	1
told	1
him	1
he	1
would	1
act	1
very	1
wisely	1
in	1
doing	1
as	1
he	1
said;	1
and	1
so,	1
highly	1
amused	1
at	1
Sancho	1
Panza’s	1
simplicities,	1
they	1
placed	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
in	1
the	1
cart	1
as	1
before.	1
The	1
procession	1
once	1
more	1
formed	1
itself	1
in	1
order	1
and	1
proceeded	1
on	1
its	1
road;	1
the	1
goatherd	1
took	1
his	1
leave	1
of	1
the	1
party;	1
the	1
officers	1
of	1
the	1
Brotherhood	1
declined	1
to	1
go	1
any	1
farther,	1
and	1
the	1
curate	1
paid	1
them	1
what	1
was	1
due	1
to	1
them;	1
the	1
canon	1
begged	1
the	1
curate	1
to	1
let	1
him	1
know	1
how	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
did,	1
whether	1
he	1
was	1
cured	1
of	1
his	1
madness	1
or	1
still	1
suffered	1
from	1
it,	1
and	1
then	1
begged	1
leave	1
to	1
continue	1
his	1
journey;	1
in	1
short,	1
they	1
all	1
separated	1
and	1
went	1
their	1
ways,	1
leaving	1
to	1
themselves	1
the	1
curate	1
and	1
the	1
barber,	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
Sancho	1
Panza,	1
and	1
the	1
good	1
Rocinante,	1
who	1
regarded	1
everything	1
with	1
as	1
great	1
resignation	1
as	1
his	1
master.	1
The	1
carter	1
yoked	1
his	1
oxen	1
and	1
made	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
comfortable	1
on	1
a	1
truss	1
of	1
hay,	1
and	1
at	1
his	1
usual	1
deliberate	1
pace	1
took	1
the	1
road	1
the	1
curate	1
directed,	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
six	1
days	1
they	1
reached	1
Don	1
Quixote’s	1
village,	1
and	1
entered	1
it	1
about	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
day,	1
which	1
it	1
so	1
happened	1
was	1
a	1
Sunday,	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
were	1
all	1
in	1
the	1
plaza,	1
through	1
which	1
Don	1
Quixote’s	1
cart	1
passed.	1
They	1
all	1
flocked	1
to	1
see	1
what	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
cart,	1
and	1
when	1
they	1
recognised	1
their	1
townsman	1
they	1
were	1
filled	1
with	1
amazement,	1
and	1
a	1
boy	1
ran	1
off	1
to	1
bring	1
the	1
news	1
to	1
his	1
housekeeper	1
and	1
his	1
niece	1
that	1
their	1
master	1
and	1
uncle	1
had	1
come	1
back	1
all	1
lean	1
and	1
yellow	1
and	1
stretched	1
on	1
a	1
truss	1
of	1
hay	1
on	1
an	1
ox-cart.	1
It	1
was	1
piteous	1
to	1
hear	1
the	1
cries	1
the	1
two	1
good	1
ladies	1
raised,	1
how	1
they	1
beat	1
their	1
breasts	1
and	1
poured	1
out	1
fresh	1
maledictions	1
on	1
those	1
accursed	1
books	1
of	1
chivalry;	1
all	1
which	1
was	1
renewed	1
when	1
they	1
saw	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
coming	1
in	1
at	1
the	1
gate.	1
At	1
the	1
news	1
of	1
Don	1
Quixote’s	1
arrival	1
Sancho	1
Panza’s	1
wife	1
came	1
running,	1
for	1
she	1
by	1
this	1
time	1
knew	1
that	1
her	1
husband	1
had	1
gone	1
away	1
with	1
him	1
as	1
his	1
squire,	1
and	1
on	1
seeing	1
Sancho,	1
the	1
first	1
thing	1
she	1
asked	1
him	1
was	1
if	1
the	1
ass	1
was	1
well.	1
Sancho	1
replied	1
that	1
he	1
was,	1
better	1
than	1
his	1
master	1
was.	1
“Thanks	1
be	1
to	1
God,”	1
said	1
she,	1
“for	1
being	1
so	1
good	1
to	1
me;	1
but	1
now	1
tell	1
me,	1
my	1
friend,	1
what	1
have	1
you	1
made	1
by	1
your	1
squirings?	1
What	1
gown	1
have	1
you	1
brought	1
me	1
back?	1
What	1
shoes	1
for	1
your	1
children?”	1
“I	1
bring	1
nothing	1
of	1
that	1
sort,	1
wife,”	1
said	1
Sancho;	1
“though	1
I	1
bring	1
other	1
things	1
of	1
more	1
consequence	1
and	1
value.”	1
“I	1
am	1
very	1
glad	1
of	1
that,”	1
returned	1
his	1
wife;	1
“show	1
me	1
these	1
things	1
of	1
more	1
value	1
and	1
consequence,	1
my	1
friend;	1
for	1
I	1
want	1
to	1
see	1
them	1
to	1
cheer	1
my	1
heart	1
that	1
has	1
been	1
so	1
sad	1
and	1
heavy	1
all	1
these	1
ages	1
that	1
you	1
have	1
been	1
away.”	1
“I	1
will	1
show	1
them	1
to	1
you	1
at	1
home,	1
wife,”	1
said	1
Sancho;	1
“be	1
content	1
for	1
the	1
present;	1
for	1
if	1
it	1
please	1
God	1
that	1
we	1
should	1
again	1
go	1
on	1
our	1
travels	1
in	1
search	1
of	1
adventures,	1
you	1
will	1
soon	1
see	1
me	1
a	1
count,	1
or	1
governor	1
of	1
an	1
island,	1
and	1
that	1
not	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
everyday	1
ones,	1
but	1
the	1
best	1
that	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
had.”	1
“Heaven	1
grant	1
it,	1
husband,”	1
said	1
she,	1
“for	1
indeed	1
we	1
have	1
need	1
of	1
it.	1
But	1
tell	1
me,	1
what’s	1
this	1
about	1
islands,	1
for	1
I	1
don’t	1
understand	1
it?”	1
“Honey	1
is	1
not	1
for	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
the	1
ass,”	1
returned	1
Sancho;	1
“all	1
in	1
good	1
time	1
thou	1
shalt	1
see,	1
wife—nay,	1
thou	1
wilt	1
be	1
surprised	1
to	1
hear	1
thyself	1
called	1
‘your	1
ladyship’	1
by	1
all	1
thy	1
vassals.”	1
“What	1
are	1
you	1
talking	1
about,	1
Sancho,	1
with	1
your	1
ladyships,	1
islands,	1
and	1
vassals?”	1
returned	1
Teresa	1
Panza—for	1
so	1
Sancho’s	1
wife	1
was	1
called,	1
though	1
they	1
were	1
not	1
relations,	1
for	1
in	1
La	1
Mancha	1
it	1
is	1
customary	1
for	1
wives	1
to	1
take	1
their	1
husbands’	1
surnames.	1
“Don’t	1
be	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
hurry	1
to	1
know	1
all	1
this,	1
Teresa,”	1
said	1
Sancho;	1
“it	1
is	1
enough	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
telling	1
you	1
the	1
truth,	1
so	1
shut	1
your	1
mouth.	1
But	1
I	1
may	1
tell	1
you	1
this	1
much	1
by	1
the	1
way,	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
nothing	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
more	1
delightful	1
than	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
person	1
of	1
consideration,	1
squire	1
to	1
a	1
knight-errant,	1
and	1
a	1
seeker	1
of	1
adventures.	1
To	1
be	1
sure	1
most	1
of	1
those	1
one	1
finds	1
do	1
not	1
end	1
as	1
pleasantly	1
as	1
one	1
could	1
wish,	1
for	1
out	1
of	1
a	1
hundred,	1
ninety-nine	1
will	1
turn	1
out	1
cross	1
and	1
contrary.	1
I	1
know	1
it	1
by	1
experience,	1
for	1
out	1
of	1
some	1
I	1
came	1
blanketed,	1
and	1
out	1
of	1
others	1
belaboured.	1
Still,	1
for	1
all	1
that,	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
fine	1
thing	1
to	1
be	1
on	1
the	1
look-out	1
for	1
what	1
may	1
happen,	1
crossing	1
mountains,	1
searching	1
woods,	1
climbing	1
rocks,	1
visiting	1
castles,	1
putting	1
up	1
at	1
inns,	1
all	1
at	1
free	1
quarters,	1
and	1
devil	1
take	1
the	1
maravedi	1
to	1
pay.”	1
While	1
this	1
conversation	1
passed	1
between	1
Sancho	1
Panza	1
and	1
his	1
wife,	1
Don	1
Quixote’s	1
housekeeper	1
and	1
niece	1
took	1
him	1
in	1
and	1
undressed	1
him	1
and	1
laid	1
him	1
in	1
his	1
old	1
bed.	1
He	1
eyed	1
them	1
askance,	1
and	1
could	1
not	1
make	1
out	1
where	1
he	1
was.	1
The	1
curate	1
charged	1
his	1
niece	1
to	1
be	1
very	1
careful	1
to	1
make	1
her	1
uncle	1
comfortable	1
and	1
to	1
keep	1
a	1
watch	1
over	1
him	1
lest	1
he	1
should	1
make	1
his	1
escape	1
from	1
them	1
again,	1
telling	1
her	1
what	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
obliged	1
to	1
do	1
to	1
bring	1
him	1
home.	1
On	1
this	1
the	1
pair	1
once	1
more	1
lifted	1
up	1
their	1
voices	1
and	1
renewed	1
their	1
maledictions	1
upon	1
the	1
books	1
of	1
chivalry,	1
and	1
implored	1
heaven	1
to	1
plunge	1
the	1
authors	1
of	1
such	1
lies	1
and	1
nonsense	1
into	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
bottomless	1
pit.	1
They	1
were,	1
in	1
short,	1
kept	1
in	1
anxiety	1
and	1
dread	1
lest	1
their	1
uncle	1
and	1
master	1
should	1
give	1
them	1
the	1
slip	1
the	1
moment	1
he	1
found	1
himself	1
somewhat	1
better,	1
and	1
as	1
they	1
feared	1
so	1
it	1
fell	1
out.	1
But	1
the	1
author	1
of	1
this	1
history,	1
though	1
he	1
has	1
devoted	1
research	1
and	1
industry	1
to	1
the	1
discovery	1
of	1
the	1
deeds	1
achieved	1
by	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
in	1
his	1
third	1
sally,	1
has	1
been	1
unable	1
to	1
obtain	1
any	1
information	1
respecting	1
them,	1
at	1
any	1
rate	1
derived	1
from	1
authentic	1
documents;	1
tradition	1
has	1
merely	1
preserved	1
in	1
the	1
memory	1
of	1
La	1
Mancha	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
the	1
third	1
time	1
he	1
sallied	1
forth	1
from	1
his	1
home,	1
betook	1
himself	1
to	1
Saragossa,	1
where	1
he	1
was	1
present	1
at	1
some	1
famous	1
jousts	1
which	1
came	1
off	1
in	1
that	1
city,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
adventures	1
there	1
worthy	1
of	1
his	1
valour	1
and	1
high	1
intelligence.	1
Of	1
his	1
end	1
and	1
death	1
he	1
could	1
learn	1
no	1
particulars,	1
nor	1
would	1
he	1
have	1
ascertained	1
it	1
or	1
known	1
of	1
it,	1
if	1
good	1
fortune	1
had	1
not	1
produced	1
an	1
old	1
physician	1
for	1
him	1
who	1
had	1
in	1
his	1
possession	1
a	1
leaden	1
box,	1
which,	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
account,	1
had	1
been	1
discovered	1
among	1
the	1
crumbling	1
foundations	1
of	1
an	1
ancient	1
hermitage	1
that	1
was	1
being	1
rebuilt;	1
in	1
which	1
box	1
were	1
found	1
certain	1
parchment	1
manuscripts	1
in	1
Gothic	1
character,	1
but	1
in	1
Castilian	1
verse,	1
containing	1
many	1
of	1
his	1
achievements,	1
and	1
setting	1
forth	1
the	1
beauty	1
of	1
Dulcinea,	1
the	1
form	1
of	1
Rocinante,	1
the	1
fidelity	1
of	1
Sancho	1
Panza,	1
and	1
the	1
burial	1
of	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
himself,	1
together	1
with	1
sundry	1
epitaphs	1
and	1
eulogies	1
on	1
his	1
life	1
and	1
character;	1
but	1
all	1
that	1
could	1
be	1
read	1
and	1
deciphered	1
were	1
those	1
which	1
the	1
trustworthy	1
author	1
of	1
this	1
new	1
and	1
unparalleled	1
history	1
here	1
presents.	1
And	1
the	1
said	1
author	1
asks	1
of	1
those	1
that	1
shall	1
read	1
it	1
nothing	1
in	1
return	1
for	1
the	1
vast	1
toil	1
which	1
it	1
has	1
cost	1
him	1
in	1
examining	1
and	1
searching	1
the	1
Manchegan	1
archives	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
bring	1
it	1
to	1
light,	1
save	1
that	1
they	1
give	1
him	1
the	1
same	1
credit	1
that	1
people	1
of	1
sense	1
give	1
to	1
the	1
books	1
of	1
chivalry	1
that	1
pervade	1
the	1
world	1
and	1
are	1
so	1
popular;	1
for	1
with	1
this	1
he	1
will	1
consider	1
himself	1
amply	1
paid	1
and	1
fully	1
satisfied,	1
and	1
will	1
be	1
encouraged	1
to	1
seek	1
out	1
and	1
produce	1
other	1
histories,	1
if	1
not	1
as	1
truthful,	1
at	1

equal	1
in	1

not	1

DEDICATION	1
OF	1
VOLUME	1
II.	1
TO	1
THE	1
COUNT	1
OF	1
LEMOS:	1
These	1
days	1
past,	1
when	1
sending	1
Your	1
Excellency	1
my	1
plays,	1
that	1
had	1
appeared	1
in	1
print	1
before	1
being	1
shown	1
on	1
the	1
stage,	1
I	1
said,	1
if	1
I	1
remember	1
well,	1
that	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
was	1
putting	1
on	1
his	1
spurs	1
to	1
go	1
and	1
render	1
homage	1
to	1
Your	1
Excellency.	1
Now	1
I	1
say	1
that	1
“with	1
his	1
spurs,	1
he	1
is	1
on	1
his	1
way.”	1
Should	1
he	1
reach	1
destination	1
methinks	1
I	1
shall	1
have	1
rendered	1
some	1
service	1
to	1
Your	1
Excellency,	1
as	1
from	1
many	1
parts	1
I	1
am	1
urged	1
to	1
send	1
him	1
off,	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
dispel	1
the	1
loathing	1
and	1
disgust	1
caused	1
by	1
another	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
who,	1
under	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Second	1
Part,	1
has	1
run	1
masquerading	1
through	1
the	1
whole	1
world.	1
And	1
he	1
who	1
has	1
shown	1
the	1
greatest	1
longing	1
for	1
him	1
has	1
been	1
the	1
great	1
Emperor	1
of	1
China,	1
who	1
wrote	1
me	1
a	1
letter	1
in	1
Chinese	1
a	1
month	1
ago	1
and	1
sent	1
it	1
by	1
a	1
special	1
courier.	1
He	1
asked	1
me,	1
or	1
to	1
be	1
truthful,	1
he	1
begged	1
me	1
to	1
send	1
him	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
for	1
he	1
intended	1
to	1
found	1
a	1
college	1
where	1
the	1
Spanish	1
tongue	1
would	1
be	1
taught,	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
his	1
wish	1
that	1
the	1
book	1
to	1
be	1
read	1
should	1
be	1
the	1
History	1
of	1
Don	1
Quixote.	1
He	1
also	1
added	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
go	1
and	1
be	1
the	1
rector	1
of	1
this	1
college.	1
I	1
asked	1
the	1
bearer	1
if	1
His	1
Majesty	1
had	1
afforded	1
a	1
sum	1
in	1
aid	1
of	1
my	1
travel	1
expenses.	1
He	1
answered,	1
“No,	1
not	1
even	1
in	1
thought.”	1
“Then,	1
brother,”	1
I	1
replied,	1
“you	1
can	1
return	1
to	1
your	1
China,	1
post	1
haste	1
or	1
at	1
whatever	1
haste	1
you	1
are	1
bound	1
to	1
go,	1
as	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
fit	1
for	1
so	1
long	1
a	1
travel	1
and,	1
besides	1
being	1
ill,	1
I	1
am	1
very	1
much	1
without	1
money,	1
while	1
Emperor	1
for	1
Emperor	1
and	1
Monarch	1
for	1
Monarch,	1
I	1
have	1
at	1
Naples	1
the	1
great	1
Count	1
of	1
Lemos,	1
who,	1
without	1
so	1
many	1
petty	1
titles	1
of	1
colleges	1
and	1
rectorships,	1
sustains	1
me,	1
protects	1
me	1
and	1
does	1
me	1
more	1
favour	1
than	1
I	1
can	1
wish	1
for.”	1
Thus	1
I	1
gave	1
him	1
his	1
leave	1
and	1
I	1
beg	1
mine	1
from	1
you,	1
offering	1
Your	1
Excellency	1
the	1
“Trabajos	1
de	1
Persiles	1

a	1
book	1
I	1
shall	1
finish	1
within	1
four	1
months,	1

which	1
will	1
be	1
either	1
the	1
worst	1
or	1
the	1
best	1
that	1
has	1
been	1
composed	1
in	1
our	1

I	1
mean	1
of	1
those	1
intended	1
for	1
entertainment;	1
at	1
which	1
I	1
repent	1
of	1
having	1
called	1
it	1
the	1
worst,	1
for,	1
in	1
the	1
opinion	1
of	1
friends,	1
it	1
is	1
bound	1
to	1
attain	1
the	1
summit	1
of	1
possible	1
quality.	1
May	1
Your	1

return	1

that	1
is	1
wished	1
you;	1
Persiles	1
will	1

to	1
find	1
there	1
retaliation,	1
scolding,	1
and	1
abuse	1
against	1
the	1
author	1
of	1
the	1
second	1
Don	1
Quixote—I	1
mean	1
him	1
who	1
was,	1
they	1
say,	1
begotten	1
at	1
Tordesillas	1
and	1
born	1
at	1
Tarragona!	1
Well	1
then,	1
the	1
truth	1
is,	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
going	1
to	1
give	1
thee	1
that	1
satisfaction;	1
for,	1
though	1
injuries	1
stir	1
up	1
anger	1
in	1
humbler	1
breasts,	1
in	1
mine	1
the	1
rule	1
must	1
admit	1
of	1
an	1
exception.	1
Thou	1
wouldst	1
have	1
me	1
call	1
him	1
ass,	1
fool,	1
and	1
malapert,	1
but	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
such	1
intention;	1
let	1
his	1
offence	1
be	1
his	1
punishment,	1
with	1
his	1
bread	1
let	1
him	1
eat	1
it,	1
and	1
there’s	1
an	1
end	1
of	1
it.	1
What	1
I	1
cannot	1
help	1
taking	1
amiss	1
is	1
that	1
he	1
charges	1
me	1
with	1
being	1
old	1
and	1
one-handed,	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
in	1
my	1
power	1
to	1
keep	1
time	1
from	1
passing	1
over	1
me,	1
or	1
as	1
if	1
the	1
loss	1
of	1
my	1
hand	1
had	1
been	1
brought	1
about	1
in	1
some	1
tavern,	1
and	1
not	1
on	1
the	1
grandest	1
occasion	1
the	1
past	1
or	1
present	1
has	1
seen,	1
or	1
the	1
future	1
can	1
hope	1
to	1
see.	1
If	1
my	1
wounds	1
have	1
no	1
beauty	1
to	1
the	1
beholder’s	1
eye,	1
they	1
are,	1
at	1
least,	1
honourable	1
in	1
the	1
estimation	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
know	1
where	1
they	1
were	1
received;	1
for	1
the	1
soldier	1
shows	1
to	1
greater	1
advantage	1
dead	1
in	1
battle	1
than	1
alive	1
in	1
flight;	1
and	1
so	1
strongly	1
is	1
this	1
my	1
feeling,	1
that	1
if	1
now	1
it	1
were	1
proposed	1
to	1
perform	1
an	1
impossibility	1
for	1
me,	1
I	1
would	1
rather	1
have	1
had	1
my	1
share	1
in	1
that	1
mighty	1
action,	1
than	1
be	1
free	1
from	1
my	1
wounds	1
this	1
minute	1
without	1
having	1
been	1
present	1
at	1
it.	1
Those	1
the	1
soldier	1
shows	1
on	1
his	1
face	1
and	1
breast	1
are	1
stars	1
that	1
direct	1
others	1
to	1
the	1
heaven	1
of	1
honour	1
and	1
ambition	1
of	1
merited	1
praise;	1
and	1
moreover	1
it	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
observed	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
with	1
grey	1
hairs	1
that	1
one	1
writes,	1
but	1
with	1
the	1
understanding,	1
and	1
that	1
commonly	1
improves	1
with	1
years.	1
I	1
take	1
it	1
amiss,	1
too,	1
that	1
he	1
calls	1
me	1
envious,	1
and	1
explains	1
to	1
me,	1
as	1
if	1
I	1
were	1
ignorant,	1
what	1
envy	1
is;	1
for	1
really	1
and	1
truly,	1
of	1
the	1
two	1
kinds	1
there	1
are,	1
I	1
only	1
know	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
holy,	1
noble,	1
and	1
high-minded;	1
and	1
if	1
that	1
be	1
so,	1
as	1
it	1
is,	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
likely	1
to	1
attack	1
a	1
priest,	1
above	1
all	1
if,	1
in	1
addition,	1
he	1
holds	1
the	1
rank	1
of	1
familiar	1
of	1
the	1
Holy	1
Office.	1
And	1
if	1
he	1
said	1
what	1
he	1
did	1
on	1
account	1
of	1
him	1
on	1
whose	1
behalf	1
it	1
seems	1
he	1
spoke,	1
he	1
is	1
entirely	1
mistaken;	1
for	1
I	1
worship	1
the	1
genius	1
of	1
that	1
person,	1
and	1
admire	1
his	1
works	1
and	1
his	1
unceasing	1
and	1
strenuous	1
industry.	1
After	1
all,	1
I	1
am	1
grateful	1
to	1
this	1
gentleman,	1
the	1
author,	1
for	1
saying	1
that	1
my	1
novels	1
are	1
more	1
satirical	1
than	1
exemplary,	1
but	1
that	1
they	1
are	1
good;	1
for	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
that	1
unless	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
little	1
of	1
everything	1
in	1
them.	1
I	1
suspect	1
thou	1
wilt	1
say	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
taking	1
a	1
very	1
humble	1
line,	1
and	1
keeping	1
myself	1
too	1
much	1
within	1
the	1
bounds	1
of	1
my	1
moderation,	1
from	1
a	1
feeling	1
that	1
additional	1
suffering	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
inflicted	1
upon	1
a	1
sufferer,	1
and	1
that	1
what	1
this	1
gentleman	1
has	1
to	1
endure	1
must	1
doubtless	1
be	1
very	1
great,	1
as	1
he	1
does	1
not	1
dare	1
to	1
come	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
open	1
field	1
and	1
broad	1
daylight,	1
but	1
hides	1
his	1
name	1
and	1
disguises	1
his	1
country	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
guilty	1
of	1
some	1
lese	1
majesty.	1
If	1
perchance	1
thou	1
shouldst	1
come	1
to	1
know	1
him,	1
tell	1
him	1
from	1
me	1
that	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
hold	1
myself	1
aggrieved;	1
for	1
I	1
know	1
well	1
what	1
the	1
temptations	1
of	1
the	1
devil	1
are,	1
and	1
that	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
greatest	1
is	1
putting	1
it	1
into	1
a	1
man’s	1
head	1
that	1
he	1
can	1
write	1
and	1
print	1
a	1
book	1
by	1
which	1
he	1
will	1
get	1
as	1
much	1
fame	1
as	1
money,	1
and	1
as	1
much	1
money	1
as	1
fame;	1
and	1
to	1
prove	1
it	1
I	1
will	1
beg	1
of	1
you,	1
in	1
your	1
own	1
sprightly,	1
pleasant	1
way,	1
to	1
tell	1
him	1
this	1
story.	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
madman	1
in	1
Seville	1
who	1
took	1
to	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
drollest	1
absurdities	1
and	1
vagaries	1
that	1
ever	1
madman	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
gave	1
way	1
to.	1
It	1
was	1
this:	1
he	1
made	1
a	1
tube	1
of	1
reed	1
sharp	1
at	1
one	1
end,	1
and	1
catching	1
a	1
dog	1
in	1
the	1
street,	1
or	1
wherever	1
it	1
might	1
be,	1
he	1
with	1
his	1
foot	1
held	1
one	1
of	1
its	1
legs	1
fast,	1
and	1
with	1
his	1
hand	1
lifted	1
up	1
the	1
other,	1
and	1
as	1
best	1
he	1
could	1
fixed	1
the	1
tube	1
where,	1
by	1
blowing,	1
he	1
made	1
the	1
dog	1
as	1
round	1
as	1
a	1
ball;	1
then	1
holding	1
it	1
in	1
this	1
position,	1
he	1
gave	1
it	1
a	1
couple	1
of	1
slaps	1
on	1
the	1
belly,	1
and	1
let	1
it	1
go,	1
saying	1
to	1
the	1
bystanders	1
(and	1
there	1
were	1
always	1
plenty	1
of	1
them):	1
“Do	1
your	1
worships	1
think,	1
now,	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
an	1
easy	1
thing	1
to	1
blow	1
up	1
a	1
dog?”—Does	1
your	1
worship	1
think	1
now,	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
an	1
easy	1
thing	1
to	1
write	1
a	1
book?	1
And	1
if	1
this	1
story	1
does	1
not	1
suit	1
him,	1
you	1
may,	1
dear	1
reader,	1
tell	1
him	1
this	1
one,	1
which	1
is	1
likewise	1
of	1
a	1
madman	1
and	1
a	1
dog.	1
In	1
Cordova	1
there	1
was	1
another	1
madman,	1
whose	1
way	1
it	1
was	1
to	1
carry	1
a	1
piece	1
of	1
marble	1
slab	1
or	1
a	1
stone,	1
not	1
of	1
the	1
lightest,	1
on	1
his	1
head,	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
came	1
upon	1
any	1
unwary	1
dog	1
he	1
used	1
to	1
draw	1
close	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
let	1
the	1
weight	1
fall	1
right	1
on	1
top	1
of	1
him;	1
on	1
which	1
the	1
dog	1
in	1
a	1
rage,	1
barking	1
and	1
howling,	1
would	1
run	1
three	1
streets	1
without	1
stopping.	1
It	1
so	1
happened,	1
however,	1
that	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
dogs	1
he	1
discharged	1
his	1
load	1
upon	1
was	1
a	1
cap-maker’s	1
dog,	1
of	1
which	1
his	1
master	1
was	1
very	1
fond.	1
The	1
stone	1
came	1
down	1
hitting	1
it	1
on	1
the	1
head,	1
the	1
dog	1
raised	1
a	1
yell	1
at	1
the	1
blow,	1
the	1
master	1
saw	1
the	1
affair	1
and	1
was	1
wroth,	1
and	1
snatching	1
up	1
a	1
measuring-yard	1
rushed	1
out	1
at	1
the	1
madman	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
leave	1
a	1
sound	1
bone	1
in	1
his	1
body,	1
and	1
at	1
every	1
stroke	1
he	1
gave	1
him	1
he	1
said,	1
“You	1
dog,	1
you	1
thief!	1
my	1
lurcher!	1
Don’t	1
you	1
see,	1
you	1
brute,	1
that	1
my	1
dog	1
is	1
a	1
lurcher?”	1
and	1
so,	1
repeating	1
the	1
word	1
“lurcher”	1
again	1
and	1
again,	1
he	1
sent	1
the	1
madman	1
away	1
beaten	1
to	1
a	1
jelly.	1
The	1
madman	1
took	1
the	1
lesson	1
to	1
heart,	1
and	1
vanished,	1
and	1
for	1
more	1
than	1
a	1
month	1
never	1
once	1
showed	1
himself	1
in	1
public;	1
but	1
after	1
that	1
he	1
came	1
out	1
again	1
with	1
his	1
old	1
trick	1
and	1
a	1
heavier	1
load	1
than	1
ever.	1
He	1
came	1
up	1
to	1
where	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
dog,	1
and	1
examining	1
it	1
very	1
carefully	1
without	1
venturing	1
to	1
let	1
the	1
stone	1
fall,	1
he	1
said:	1
“This	1
is	1
a	1
lurcher;	1
ware!”	1
In	1
short,	1
all	1
the	1
dogs	1
he	1
came	1
across,	1
be	1
they	1
mastiffs	1
or	1
terriers,	1
he	1
said	1
were	1
lurchers;	1
and	1
he	1
discharged	1
no	1
more	1
stones.	1
Maybe	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
the	1
same	1
with	1
this	1
historian;	1
that	1
he	1
will	1
not	1
venture	1
another	1
time	1
to	1
discharge	1
the	1
weight	1
of	1
his	1
wit	1
in	1
books,	1
which,	1
being	1
bad,	1
are	1
harder	1
than	1
stones.	1
Tell	1
him,	1
too,	1
that	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
care	1
a	1
farthing	1
for	1
the	1
threat	1
he	1
holds	1
out	1
to	1
me	1
of	1
depriving	1
me	1
of	1
my	1
profit	1
by	1
means	1
of	1
his	1
book;	1
for,	1
to	1
borrow	1
from	1
the	1
famous	1
interlude	1
of	1
“The	1
Perendenga,”	1
I	1
say	1
in	1
answer	1
to	1
him,	1
“Long	1
life	1
to	1
my	1
lord	1
the	1
Veintiquatro,	1
and	1
Christ	1
be	1
with	1
us	1
all.”	1
Long	1
life	1
to	1
the	1
great	1
Conde	1
de	1
Lemos,	1
whose	1
Christian	1
charity	1
and	1
well-known	1
generosity	1
support	1
me	1
against	1
all	1
the	1
strokes	1
of	1
my	1
curst	1
fortune;	1
and	1
long	1
life	1
to	1
the	1
supreme	1
benevolence	1
of	1
His	1
Eminence	1
of	1
Toledo,	1
Don	1
Bernardo	1
de	1
Sandoval	1
y	1
Rojas;	1
and	1
what	1
matter	1
if	1
there	1
be	1
no	1
printing-presses	1
in	1
the	1
world,	1
or	1
if	1
they	1
print	1
more	1
books	1
against	1
me	1
than	1
there	1
are	1
letters	1
in	1
the	1
verses	1
of	1
Mingo	1
Revulgo!	1
These	1
two	1
princes,	1
unsought	1
by	1
any	1
adulation	1
or	1
flattery	1
of	1
mine,	1
of	1
their	1
own	1
goodness	1
alone,	1
have	1
taken	1
it	1
upon	1
them	1
to	1
show	1
me	1
kindness	1
and	1
protect	1
me,	1
and	1
in	1
this	1
I	1
consider	1
myself	1
happier	1
and	1
richer	1
than	1
if	1
Fortune	1
had	1
raised	1
me	1
to	1
her	1
greatest	1
height	1
in	1
the	1
ordinary	1
way.	1
The	1
poor	1
man	1
may	1
retain	1
honour,	1
but	1
not	1
the	1
vicious;	1
poverty	1
may	1
cast	1
a	1
cloud	1
over	1
nobility,	1
but	1
cannot	1
hide	1
it	1
altogether;	1
and	1
as	1
virtue	1
of	1
itself	1
sheds	1
a	1
certain	1
light,	1
even	1
though	1
it	1
be	1
through	1
the	1
straits	1
and	1
chinks	1
of	1
penury,	1
it	1
wins	1
the	1
esteem	1
of	1
lofty	1
and	1
noble	1
spirits,	1
and	1
in	1
consequence	1
their	1
protection.	1
Thou	1
needst	1
say	1
no	1
more	1
to	1
him,	1
nor	1
will	1
I	1
say	1
anything	1
more	1
to	1
thee,	1
save	1
to	1
tell	1
thee	1
to	1
bear	1
in	1
mind	1
that	1
this	1
Second	1
Part	1
of	1
“Don	1
Quixote”	1
which	1
I	1
offer	1
thee	1
is	1
cut	1
by	1
the	1
same	1
craftsman	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
same	1
cloth	1
as	1
the	1
First,	1
and	1
that	1
in	1
it	1
I	1
present	1
thee	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
continued,	1
and	1
at	1
length	1
dead	1
and	1
buried,	1
so	1
that	1
no	1
one	1
may	1
dare	1
to	1
bring	1
forward	1
any	1
further	1
evidence	1
against	1
him,	1
for	1
that	1
already	1
produced	1
is	1
sufficient;	1
and	1
suffice	1
it,	1
too,	1
that	1
some	1
reputable	1
person	1
should	1
have	1
given	1
an	1
account	1
of	1
all	1
these	1
shrewd	1
lunacies	1
of	1
his	1
without	1
going	1
into	1
the	1
matter	1
again;	1
for	1
abundance,	1
even	1
of	1
good	1
things,	1
prevents	1
them	1
from	1
being	1
valued;	1
and	1
scarcity,	1
even	1
in	1
the	1
case	1
of	1
what	1
is	1
bad,	1
confers	1
a	1
certain	1
value.	1
I	1
was	1
forgetting	1
to	1
tell	1
thee	1
that	1
thou	1
mayest	1
expect	1
the	1

to	1
be	1
careful	1
to	1
treat	1
him	1
with	1
attention,	1
and	1
give	1
him	1
comforting	1
things	1
to	1
eat,	1
and	1
such	1
as	1
were	1
good	1
for	1
the	1
heart	1
and	1
the	1
brain,	1
whence,	1
it	1
was	1
plain	1
to	1
see,	1
all	1
his	1
misfortune	1
proceeded.	1
The	1
niece	1
and	1
housekeeper	1
replied	1
that	1
they	1
did	1
so,	1
and	1
meant	1
to	1
do	1
so	1
with	1
all	1
possible	1
care	1
and	1
assiduity,	1
for	1
they	1
could	1
perceive	1
that	1
their	1
master	1
was	1
now	1
and	1
then	1
beginning	1
to	1
show	1
signs	1
of	1
being	1
in	1
his	1
right	1
mind.	1
This	1
gave	1
great	1
satisfaction	1
to	1
the	1
curate	1
and	1
the	1
barber,	1
for	1
they	1
concluded	1
they	1
had	1
taken	1
the	1
right	1
course	1
in	1
carrying	1
him	1
off	1
enchanted	1
on	1
the	1
ox-cart,	1
as	1
has	1
been	1
described	1
in	1
the	1
First	1
Part	1
of	1
this	1
great	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
accurate	1
history,	1
in	1
the	1
last	1
chapter	1
thereof.	1
So	1
they	1
resolved	1
to	1
pay	1
him	1
a	1
visit	1
and	1
test	1
the	1
improvement	1
in	1
his	1
condition,	1
although	1
they	1
thought	1
it	1
almost	1
impossible	1
that	1
there	1
could	1
be	1
any;	1
and	1
they	1
agreed	1
not	1
to	1
touch	1
upon	1
any	1
point	1
connected	1
with	1
knight-errantry	1
so	1
as	1
not	1
to	1
run	1
the	1
risk	1
of	1
reopening	1
wounds	1
which	1
were	1
still	1
so	1
tender.	1
They	1
came	1
to	1
see	1
him	1
consequently,	1
and	1
found	1
him	1
sitting	1
up	1
in	1
bed	1
in	1
a	1
green	1
baize	1
waistcoat	1
and	1
a	1
red	1
Toledo	1
cap,	1
and	1
so	1
withered	1
and	1
dried	1
up	1
that	1
he	1
looked	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
turned	1
into	1
a	1
mummy.	1
They	1
were	1
very	1
cordially	1
received	1
by	1
him;	1
they	1
asked	1
him	1
after	1
his	1
health,	1
and	1
he	1
talked	1
to	1
them	1
about	1
himself	1
very	1
naturally	1
and	1
in	1
very	1
well-chosen	1
language.	1
In	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
their	1
conversation	1
they	1
fell	1
to	1
discussing	1
what	1
they	1
call	1
State-craft	1
and	1
systems	1
of	1
government,	1
correcting	1
this	1
abuse	1
and	1
condemning	1
that,	1
reforming	1
one	1
practice	1
and	1
abolishing	1
another,	1
each	1
of	1
the	1
three	1
setting	1
up	1
for	1
a	1
new	1
legislator,	1
a	1
modern	1
Lycurgus,	1
or	1
a	1
brand-new	1
Solon;	1
and	1
so	1
completely	1
did	1
they	1
remodel	1
the	1
State,	1
that	1
they	1
seemed	1
to	1
have	1
thrust	1
it	1
into	1
a	1
furnace	1
and	1
taken	1
out	1
something	1
quite	1
different	1
from	1
what	1
they	1
had	1
put	1
in;	1
and	1
on	1
all	1
the	1
subjects	1
they	1
dealt	1
with,	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
spoke	1
with	1
such	1
good	1
sense	1
that	1
the	1
pair	1
of	1
examiners	1
were	1
fully	1
convinced	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
quite	1
recovered	1
and	1
in	1
his	1
full	1
senses.	1
The	1
niece	1
and	1
housekeeper	1
were	1
present	1
at	1
the	1
conversation	1
and	1
could	1
not	1
find	1
words	1
enough	1
to	1
express	1
their	1
thanks	1
to	1
God	1
at	1
seeing	1
their	1
master	1
so	1
clear	1
in	1
his	1
mind;	1
the	1
curate,	1
however,	1
changing	1
his	1
original	1
plan,	1
which	1
was	1
to	1
avoid	1
touching	1
upon	1
matters	1
of	1
chivalry,	1
resolved	1
to	1
test	1
Don	1
Quixote’s	1
recovery	1
thoroughly,	1
and	1
see	1
whether	1
it	1
were	1
genuine	1
or	1
not;	1
and	1
so,	1
from	1
one	1
subject	1
to	1
another,	1
he	1
came	1
at	1
last	1
to	1
talk	1
of	1
the	1
news	1
that	1
had	1
come	1
from	1
the	1
capital,	1
and,	1
among	1
other	1
things,	1
he	1
said	1
it	1
was	1
considered	1
certain	1
that	1
the	1
Turk	1
was	1
coming	1
down	1
with	1
a	1
powerful	1
fleet,	1
and	1
that	1
no	1
one	1
knew	1
what	1
his	1
purpose	1
was,	1
or	1
when	1
the	1
great	1
storm	1
would	1
burst;	1
and	1
that	1
all	1
Christendom	1
was	1
in	1
apprehension	1
of	1
this,	1
which	1
almost	1
every	1
year	1
calls	1
us	1
to	1
arms,	1
and	1
that	1
his	1
Majesty	1
had	1
made	1
provision	1
for	1
the	1
security	1
of	1
the	1
coasts	1
of	1
Naples	1
and	1
Sicily	1
and	1
the	1
island	1
of	1
Malta.	1
To	1
this	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
replied,	1
“His	1
Majesty	1
has	1
acted	1
like	1
a	1
prudent	1
warrior	1
in	1
providing	1
for	1
the	1
safety	1
of	1
his	1
realms	1
in	1
time,	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
enemy	1
may	1
not	1
find	1
him	1
unprepared;	1
but	1
if	1
my	1
advice	1
were	1
taken	1
I	1
would	1
recommend	1
him	1
to	1
adopt	1
a	1
measure	1
which	1
at	1
present,	1
no	1
doubt,	1
his	1
Majesty	1
is	1
very	1
far	1
from	1
thinking	1
of.”	1
The	1
moment	1
the	1
curate	1
heard	1
this	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
himself,	1
“God	1
keep	1
thee	1
in	1
his	1
hand,	1
poor	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
for	1
it	1
seems	1
to	1
me	1
thou	1
art	1
precipitating	1
thyself	1
from	1
the	1
height	1
of	1
thy	1
madness	1
into	1
the	1
profound	1
abyss	1
of	1
thy	1
simplicity.”	1
But	1
the	1
barber,	1
who	1
had	1
the	1
same	1
suspicion	1
as	1
the	1
curate,	1
asked	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
what	1
would	1
be	1
his	1
advice	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
measures	1
that	1
he	1
said	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
adopted;	1
for	1
perhaps	1
it	1
might	1
prove	1
to	1
be	1
one	1
that	1
would	1
have	1
to	1
be	1
added	1
to	1
the	1
list	1
of	1
the	1
many	1
impertinent	1
suggestions	1
that	1
people	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
habit	1
of	1
offering	1
to	1
princes.	1
“Mine,	1
master	1
shaver,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“will	1
not	1
be	1
impertinent,	1
but,	1
on	1
the	1
contrary,	1
pertinent.”	1
“I	1
don’t	1
mean	1
that,”	1
said	1
the	1
barber,	1
“but	1
that	1
experience	1
has	1
shown	1
that	1
all	1
or	1
most	1
of	1
the	1
expedients	1
which	1
are	1
proposed	1
to	1
his	1
Majesty	1
are	1
either	1
impossible,	1
or	1
absurd,	1
or	1
injurious	1
to	1
the	1
King	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
kingdom.”	1
“Mine,	1
however,”	1
replied	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“is	1
neither	1
impossible	1
nor	1
absurd,	1
but	1
the	1
easiest,	1
the	1
most	1
reasonable,	1
the	1
readiest	1
and	1
most	1
expeditious	1
that	1
could	1
suggest	1
itself	1
to	1
any	1
projector’s	1
mind.”	1
“You	1
take	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
to	1
tell	1
it,	1
Señor	1
Don	1
Quixote,”	1
said	1
the	1
curate.	1
“I	1
don’t	1
choose	1
to	1
tell	1
it	1
here,	1
now,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“and	1
have	1
it	1
reach	1
the	1
ears	1
of	1
the	1
lords	1
of	1
the	1
council	1
to-morrow	1
morning,	1
and	1
some	1
other	1
carry	1
off	1
the	1
thanks	1
and	1
rewards	1
of	1
my	1
trouble.”	1
“For	1
my	1
part,”	1
said	1
the	1
barber,	1
“I	1
give	1
my	1
word	1
here	1
and	1
before	1
God	1
that	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
repeat	1
what	1
your	1
worship	1
says,	1
to	1
King,	1
Rook	1
or	1
earthly	1
man—an	1
oath	1
I	1
learned	1
from	1
the	1
ballad	1
of	1
the	1
curate,	1
who,	1
in	1
the	1
prelude,	1
told	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
the	1
thief	1
who	1
had	1
robbed	1
him	1
of	1
the	1
hundred	1
gold	1
crowns	1
and	1
his	1
pacing	1
mule.”	1
“I	1
am	1
not	1
versed	1
in	1
stories,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
“but	1
I	1
know	1
the	1
oath	1
is	1
a	1
good	1
one,	1
because	1
I	1
know	1
the	1
barber	1
to	1
be	1
an	1
honest	1
fellow.”	1
“Even	1
if	1
he	1
were	1
not,”	1
said	1
the	1
curate,	1
“I	1
will	1
go	1
bail	1
and	1
answer	1
for	1
him	1
that	1
in	1
this	1
matter	1
he	1
will	1
be	1
as	1
silent	1
as	1
a	1
dummy,	1
under	1
pain	1
of	1
paying	1
any	1
penalty	1
that	1
may	1
be	1
pronounced.”	1
“And	1
who	1
will	1
be	1
security	1
for	1
you,	1
señor	1
curate?”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote.	1
“My	1
profession,”	1
replied	1
the	1
curate,	1
“which	1
is	1
to	1
keep	1
secrets.”	1
“Ods	1
body!”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
at	1
this,	1
“what	1
more	1
has	1
his	1
Majesty	1
to	1
do	1
but	1
to	1
command,	1
by	1
public	1
proclamation,	1
all	1
the	1
knights-errant	1
that	1
are	1
scattered	1
over	1
Spain	1
to	1
assemble	1
on	1
a	1
fixed	1
day	1
in	1
the	1
capital,	1
for	1
even	1
if	1
no	1
more	1
than	1
half	1
a	1
dozen	1
come,	1
there	1
may	1
be	1
one	1
among	1
them	1
who	1
alone	1
will	1
suffice	1
to	1
destroy	1
the	1
entire	1
might	1
of	1
the	1
Turk.	1
Give	1
me	1
your	1
attention	1
and	1
follow	1
me.	1
Is	1
it,	1
pray,	1
any	1
new	1
thing	1
for	1
a	1
single	1
knight-errant	1
to	1
demolish	1
an	1
army	1
of	1
two	1
hundred	1
thousand	1
men,	1
as	1
if	1
they	1
all	1
had	1
but	1
one	1
throat	1
or	1
were	1
made	1
of	1
sugar	1
paste?	1
Nay,	1
tell	1
me,	1
how	1
many	1
histories	1
are	1
there	1
filled	1
with	1
these	1
marvels?	1
If	1
only	1
(in	1
an	1
evil	1
hour	1
for	1
me:	1
I	1
don’t	1
speak	1
for	1
anyone	1
else)	1
the	1
famous	1
Don	1
Belianis	1
were	1
alive	1
now,	1
or	1
anyone	1
of	1
the	1
innumerable	1
progeny	1
of	1
Amadis	1
of	1
Gaul!	1
If	1
any	1
these	1
were	1
alive	1
to-day,	1
and	1
were	1
to	1
come	1
face	1
to	1
face	1
with	1
the	1
Turk,	1
by	1
my	1
faith,	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
give	1
much	1
for	1
the	1
Turk’s	1
chance.	1
But	1
God	1
will	1
have	1
regard	1
for	1
his	1
people,	1
and	1
will	1
provide	1
someone,	1
who,	1
if	1
not	1
so	1
valiant	1
as	1
the	1
knights-errant	1
of	1
yore,	1
at	1
least	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
inferior	1
to	1
them	1
in	1
spirit;	1
but	1
God	1
knows	1
what	1
I	1
mean,	1
and	1
I	1
say	1
no	1
more.”	1
“Alas!”	1
exclaimed	1
the	1
niece	1
at	1
this,	1
“may	1
I	1
die	1
if	1
my	1
master	1
does	1
not	1
want	1
to	1
turn	1
knight-errant	1
again;”	1
to	1
which	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
replied,	1
“A	1
knight-errant	1
I	1
shall	1
die,	1
and	1
let	1
the	1
Turk	1
come	1
down	1
or	1
go	1
up	1
when	1
he	1
likes,	1
and	1
in	1
as	1
strong	1
force	1
as	1
he	1
can,	1
once	1
more	1
I	1
say,	1
God	1
knows	1
what	1
I	1
mean.”	1
But	1
here	1
the	1
barber	1
said,	1
“I	1
ask	1
your	1
worships	1
to	1
give	1
me	1
leave	1
to	1
tell	1
a	1
short	1
story	1
of	1
something	1
that	1
happened	1
in	1
Seville,	1
which	1
comes	1
so	1
pat	1
to	1
the	1
purpose	1
just	1
now	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
like	1
greatly	1
to	1
tell	1
it.”	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
gave	1
him	1
leave,	1
and	1
the	1
rest	1
prepared	1
to	1
listen,	1
and	1
he	1
began	1
thus:	1
“In	1
the	1
madhouse	1
at	1
Seville	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
man	1
whom	1
his	1
relations	1
had	1
placed	1
there	1
as	1
being	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
mind.	1
He	1
was	1
a	1
graduate	1
of	1
Osuna	1
in	1
canon	1
law;	1
but	1
even	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
of	1
Salamanca,	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
opinion	1
of	1
most	1
people	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
mad	1
all	1
the	1
same.	1
This	1
graduate,	1
after	1
some	1
years	1
of	1
confinement,	1
took	1
it	1
into	1
his	1
head	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
sane	1
and	1
in	1
his	1
full	1
senses,	1
and	1
under	1
this	1
impression	1
wrote	1
to	1
the	1
Archbishop,	1
entreating	1
him	1
earnestly,	1
and	1
in	1
very	1
correct	1
language,	1
to	1
have	1
him	1
released	1
from	1
the	1
misery	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
living;	1
for	1
by	1
God’s	1
mercy	1
he	1
had	1
now	1
recovered	1
his	1
lost	1
reason,	1
though	1
his	1
relations,	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
enjoy	1
his	1
property,	1
kept	1
him	1
there,	1
and,	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
the	1
truth,	1
would	1
make	1
him	1
out	1
to	1
be	1
mad	1
until	1
his	1
dying	1
day.	1
The	1
Archbishop,	1
moved	1
by	1
repeated	1
sensible,	1
well-written	1
letters,	1
directed	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
chaplains	1
to	1
make	1
inquiry	1
of	1
the	1
madhouse	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
truth	1
of	1
the	1
licentiate’s	1
statements,	1
and	1
to	1
have	1
an	1
interview	1
with	1
the	1
madman	1
himself,	1
and,	1
if	1
it	1
should	1
appear	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
his	1
senses,	1
to	1
take	1
him	1
out	1
and	1
restore	1
him	1
to	1
liberty.	1
The	1
chaplain	1
did	1
so,	1
and	1
the	1
governor	1
assured	1
him	1
that	1
the	1
man	1
was	1
still	1
mad,	1
and	1
that	1
though	1
he	1
often	1
spoke	1
like	1
a	1
highly	1
intelligent	1
person,	1
he	1
would	1
in	1
the	1
end	1
break	1
out	1
into	1
nonsense	1
that	1
in	1
quantity	1
and	1
quality	1
counterbalanced	1
all	1
the	1
sensible	1
things	1
he	1
had	1
said	1
before,	1
as	1
might	1
be	1
easily	1
tested	1
by	1
talking	1
to	1
him.	1
The	1
chaplain	1
resolved	1
to	1
try	1
the	1
experiment,	1
and	1
obtaining	1
access	1
to	1
the	1
madman	1
conversed	1
with	1
him	1
for	1
an	1
hour	1
or	1
more,	1
during	1
the	1
whole	1
of	1
which	1
time	1
he	1
never	1
uttered	1
a	1
word	1
that	1
was	1
incoherent	1
or	1
absurd,	1
but,	1
on	1
the	1
contrary,	1
spoke	1
so	1
rationally	1
that	1
the	1
chaplain	1
was	1
compelled	1
to	1
believe	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
sane.	1
Among	1
other	1
things,	1
he	1
said	1
the	1
governor	1
was	1
against	1
him,	1
not	1
to	1
lose	1
the	1
presents	1
his	1
relations	1
made	1
him	1
for	1
reporting	1
him	1
still	1
mad	1
but	1
with	1
lucid	1
intervals;	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
worst	1
foe	1
he	1
had	1
in	1
his	1
misfortune	1
was	1
his	1
large	1
property;	1
for	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
enjoy	1
it	1
his	1
enemies	1
disparaged	1
and	1
threw	1
doubts	1
upon	1
the	1
mercy	1
our	1
Lord	1
had	1
shown	1
him	1
in	1
turning	1
him	1
from	1
a	1
brute	1
beast	1
into	1
a	1
man.	1
In	1
short,	1
he	1
spoke	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
way	1
that	1
he	1
cast	1
suspicion	1
on	1
the	1
governor,	1
and	1
made	1
his	1
relations	1
appear	1
covetous	1
and	1
heartless,	1
and	1
himself	1
so	1
rational	1
that	1
the	1
chaplain	1
determined	1
to	1
take	1
him	1
away	1
with	1
him	1
that	1
the	1
Archbishop	1
might	1
see	1
him,	1
and	1
ascertain	1
for	1
himself	1
the	1
truth	1
of	1
the	1
matter.	1
Yielding	1
to	1
this	1
conviction,	1
the	1
worthy	1
chaplain	1
begged	1
the	1
governor	1
to	1
have	1
the	1
clothes	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
licentiate	1
had	1
entered	1
the	1
house	1
given	1
to	1
him.	1
The	1
governor	1
again	1
bade	1
him	1
beware	1
of	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
doing,	1
as	1
the	1
licentiate	1
was	1
beyond	1
a	1
doubt	1
still	1
mad;	1
but	1
all	1
his	1
cautions	1
and	1
warnings	1
were	1
unavailing	1
to	1
dissuade	1
the	1
chaplain	1
from	1
taking	1
him	1
away.	1
The	1
governor,	1
seeing	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
order	1
of	1
the	1
Archbishop,	1
obeyed,	1
and	1
they	1
dressed	1
the	1
licentiate	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
clothes,	1
which	1
were	1
new	1
and	1
decent.	1
He,	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
saw	1
himself	1
clothed	1
like	1
one	1
in	1
his	1
senses,	1
and	1
divested	1
of	1
the	1
appearance	1
of	1
a	1
madman,	1
entreated	1
the	1
chaplain	1
to	1
permit	1
him	1
in	1
charity	1
to	1
go	1
and	1
take	1
leave	1
of	1
his	1
comrades	1
the	1
madmen.	1
The	1
chaplain	1
said	1
he	1
would	1
go	1
with	1
him	1
to	1
see	1
what	1
madmen	1
there	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
house;	1
so	1
they	1
went	1
upstairs,	1
and	1
with	1
them	1
some	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
were	1
present.	1
Approaching	1
a	1
cage	1
in	1
which	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
furious	1
madman,	1
though	1
just	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
calm	1
and	1
quiet,	1
the	1
licentiate	1
said	1
to	1
him,	1
‘Brother,	1
think	1
if	1
you	1
have	1
any	1
commands	1
for	1
me,	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
going	1
home,	1
as	1
God	1
has	1
been	1
pleased,	1
in	1
his	1
infinite	1
goodness	1
and	1
mercy,	1
without	1
any	1
merit	1
of	1
mine,	1
to	1
restore	1
me	1
my	1
reason.	1
I	1
am	1
now	1
cured	1
and	1
in	1
my	1
senses,	1
for	1
with	1
God’s	1
power	1
nothing	1
is	1
impossible.	1
Have	1
strong	1
hope	1
and	1
trust	1
in	1
him,	1
for	1
as	1
he	1
has	1
restored	1
me	1
to	1
my	1
original	1
condition,	1
so	1
likewise	1
he	1
will	1
restore	1
you	1
if	1
you	1
trust	1
in	1
him.	1
I	1
will	1
take	1
care	1
to	1
send	1
you	1
some	1
good	1
things	1
to	1
eat;	1
and	1
be	1
sure	1
you	1
eat	1
them;	1
for	1
I	1
would	1
have	1
you	1
know	1
I	1
am	1
convinced,	1
as	1
one	1
who	1
has	1
gone	1
through	1
it,	1
that	1
all	1
this	1
madness	1
of	1
ours	1
comes	1
of	1
having	1
the	1
stomach	1
empty	1
and	1
the	1
brains	1
full	1
of	1
wind.	1
Take	1
courage!	1
take	1
courage!	1
for	1
despondency	1
in	1
misfortune	1
breaks	1
down	1
health	1
and	1
brings	1
on	1
death.’	1
“To	1
all	1
these	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
licentiate	1
another	1
madman	1
in	1
a	1
cage	1
opposite	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
furious	1
one	1
was	1
listening;	1
and	1
raising	1
himself	1
up	1
from	1
an	1
old	1
mat	1
on	1
which	1
he	1
lay	1
stark	1
naked,	1
he	1
asked	1
in	1
a	1
loud	1
voice	1
who	1
it	1
was	1
that	1
was	1
going	1
away	1
cured	1
and	1
in	1
his	1
senses.	1
The	1
licentiate	1
answered,	1
‘It	1
is	1
I,	1
brother,	1
who	1
am	1
going;	1
I	1
have	1
now	1
no	1
need	1
to	1
remain	1
here	1
any	1
longer,	1
for	1
which	1
I	1
return	1
infinite	1
thanks	1
to	1
Heaven	1
that	1
has	1
had	1
so	1
great	1
mercy	1
upon	1
me.’	1
“‘Mind	1
what	1
you	1
are	1
saying,	1
licentiate;	1
don’t	1
let	1
the	1
devil	1
deceive	1
you,’	1
replied	1
the	1
madman.	1
‘Keep	1
quiet,	1
stay	1
where	1
you	1
are,	1
and	1
you	1
will	1
save	1
yourself	1
the	1
trouble	1
of	1
coming	1
back.’	1
“‘I	1
know	1
I	1
am	1
cured,’	1
returned	1
the	1
licentiate,	1
‘and	1
that	1
I	1
shall	1
not	1
have	1
to	1
go	1
stations	1
again.’	1
“‘You	1
cured!’	1
said	1
the	1
madman;	1
‘well,	1
we	1
shall	1
see;	1
God	1
be	1
with	1
you;	1
but	1
I	1
swear	1
to	1
you	1
by	1
Jupiter,	1
whose	1
majesty	1
I	1
represent	1
on	1
earth,	1
that	1
for	1
this	1
crime	1
alone,	1
which	1
Seville	1
is	1
committing	1
to-day	1
in	1
releasing	1
you	1
from	1
this	1
house,	1
and	1
treating	1
you	1
as	1
if	1
you	1
were	1
in	1
your	1
senses,	1
I	1
shall	1
have	1
to	1
inflict	1
such	1
a	1
punishment	1
on	1
it	1
as	1
will	1
be	1
remembered	1
for	1
ages	1
and	1
ages,	1
amen.	1
Dost	1
thou	1
not	1
know,	1
thou	1
miserable	1
little	1
licentiate,	1
that	1
I	1
can	1
do	1
it,	1
being,	1
as	1
I	1
say,	1
Jupiter	1
the	1
Thunderer,	1
who	1
hold	1
in	1
my	1
hands	1
the	1
fiery	1
bolts	1
with	1
which	1
I	1
am	1
able	1
and	1
am	1
wont	1
to	1
threaten	1
and	1
lay	1
waste	1
the	1
world?	1
But	1
in	1
one	1
way	1
only	1
will	1
I	1
punish	1
this	1
ignorant	1
town,	1
and	1
that	1
is	1
by	1
not	1
raining	1
upon	1
it,	1
nor	1
on	1
any	1
part	1
of	1
its	1
district	1
or	1
territory,	1
for	1
three	1
whole	1
years,	1
to	1
be	1
reckoned	1
from	1
the	1
day	1
and	1
moment	1
when	1
this	1
threat	1
is	1
pronounced.	1
Thou	1
free,	1
thou	1
cured,	1
thou	1
in	1
thy	1
senses!	1
and	1
I	1
mad,	1
I	1
disordered,	1
I	1
bound!	1
I	1
will	1
as	1
soon	1
think	1
of	1
sending	1
rain	1
as	1
of	1
hanging	1
myself.	1
“Those	1
present	1
stood	1
listening	1
to	1
the	1
words	1
and	1
exclamations	1
of	1
the	1
madman;	1
but	1
our	1
licentiate,	1
turning	1
to	1
the	1
chaplain	1
and	1
seizing	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
hands,	1
said	1
to	1
him,	1
‘Be	1
not	1
uneasy,	1
señor;	1
attach	1
no	1
importance	1
to	1
what	1
this	1
madman	1
has	1
said;	1
for	1
if	1
he	1
is	1
Jupiter	1
and	1
will	1
not	1
send	1
rain,	1
I,	1
who	1
am	1
Neptune,	1
the	1
father	1
and	1
god	1
of	1
the	1
waters,	1
will	1
rain	1
as	1
often	1
as	1
it	1
pleases	1
me	1
and	1
may	1
be	1
needful.’	1
“The	1
governor	1
and	1
the	1
bystanders	1
laughed,	1
and	1
at	1
their	1
laughter	1
the	1
chaplain	1
was	1
half	1
ashamed,	1
and	1
he	1
replied,	1
‘For	1
all	1
that,	1
Señor	1
Neptune,	1
it	1
will	1
not	1
do	1
to	1
vex	1
Señor	1
Jupiter;	1
remain	1
where	1
you	1
are,	1
and	1
some	1
other	1
day,	1
when	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
better	1
opportunity	1
and	1
more	1
time,	1
we	1
will	1
come	1
back	1
for	1
you.’	1
So	1
they	1
stripped	1
the	1
licentiate,	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
left	1
where	1
he	1
was;	1
and	1
that’s	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
story.”	1
“So	1
that’s	1
the	1
story,	1
master	1
barber,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“which	1
came	1
in	1
so	1
pat	1
to	1
the	1
purpose	1
that	1
you	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
telling	1
it?	1
Master	1
shaver,	1
master	1
shaver!	1
how	1
blind	1
is	1
he	1
who	1
cannot	1
see	1
through	1
a	1
sieve.	1
Is	1
it	1
possible	1
that	1
you	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
that	1
comparisons	1
of	1
wit	1
with	1
wit,	1
valour	1
with	1
valour,	1
beauty	1
with	1
beauty,	1
birth	1
with	1
birth,	1
are	1
always	1
odious	1
and	1
unwelcome?	1
I,	1
master	1
barber,	1
am	1
not	1
Neptune,	1
the	1
god	1
of	1
the	1
waters,	1
nor	1
do	1
I	1
try	1
to	1
make	1
anyone	1
take	1
me	1
for	1
an	1
astute	1
man,	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
one.	1
My	1
only	1
endeavour	1
is	1
to	1
convince	1
the	1
world	1
of	1
the	1
mistake	1
it	1
makes	1
in	1
not	1
reviving	1
in	1
itself	1
the	1
happy	1
time	1
when	1
the	1
order	1
of	1
knight-errantry	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
field.	1
But	1
our	1
depraved	1
age	1
does	1
not	1
deserve	1
to	1
enjoy	1
such	1
a	1
blessing	1
as	1
those	1
ages	1
enjoyed	1
when	1
knights-errant	1
took	1
upon	1
their	1
shoulders	1
the	1
defence	1
of	1
kingdoms,	1
the	1
protection	1
of	1
damsels,	1
the	1
succour	1
of	1
orphans	1
and	1
minors,	1
the	1
chastisement	1
of	1
the	1
proud,	1
and	1
the	1
recompense	1
of	1
the	1
humble.	1
With	1
the	1
knights	1
of	1
these	1
days,	1
for	1
the	1
most	1
part,	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
damask,	1
brocade,	1
and	1
rich	1
stuffs	1
they	1
wear,	1
that	1
rustle	1
as	1
they	1
go,	1
not	1
the	1
chain	1
mail	1
of	1
their	1
armour;	1
no	1
knight	1
now-a-days	1
sleeps	1
in	1
the	1
open	1
field	1
exposed	1
to	1
the	1
inclemency	1
of	1
heaven,	1
and	1
in	1
full	1
panoply	1
from	1
head	1
to	1
foot;	1
no	1
one	1
now	1
takes	1
a	1
nap,	1
as	1
they	1
call	1
it,	1
without	1
drawing	1
his	1
feet	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
stirrups,	1
and	1
leaning	1
upon	1
his	1
lance,	1
as	1
the	1
knights-errant	1
used	1
to	1
do;	1
no	1
one	1
now,	1
issuing	1
from	1
the	1
wood,	1
penetrates	1
yonder	1
mountains,	1
and	1
then	1
treads	1
the	1
barren,	1
lonely	1
shore	1
of	1
the	1
sea—mostly	1
a	1
tempestuous	1
and	1
stormy	1
one—and	1
finding	1
on	1
the	1
beach	1
a	1
little	1
bark	1
without	1
oars,	1
sail,	1
mast,	1
or	1
tackling	1
of	1
any	1
kind,	1
in	1
the	1
intrepidity	1
of	1
his	1
heart	1
flings	1
himself	1
into	1
it	1
and	1
commits	1
himself	1
to	1
the	1
wrathful	1
billows	1
of	1
the	1
deep	1
sea,	1
that	1
one	1
moment	1
lift	1
him	1
up	1
to	1
heaven	1
and	1
the	1
next	1
plunge	1
him	1
into	1
the	1
depths;	1
and	1
opposing	1
his	1
breast	1
to	1
the	1
irresistible	1
gale,	1
finds	1
himself,	1
when	1
he	1
least	1
expects	1
it,	1
three	1
thousand	1
leagues	1
and	1
more	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
he	1
embarked;	1
and	1
leaping	1
ashore	1
in	1
a	1
remote	1
and	1
unknown	1
land	1
has	1
adventures	1
that	1
deserve	1
to	1
be	1
written,	1
not	1
on	1
parchment,	1
but	1
on	1
brass.	1
But	1
now	1
sloth	1
triumphs	1
over	1
energy,	1
indolence	1
over	1
exertion,	1
vice	1
over	1
virtue,	1
arrogance	1
over	1
courage,	1
and	1
theory	1
over	1
practice	1
in	1
arms,	1
which	1
flourished	1
and	1
shone	1
only	1
in	1
the	1
golden	1
ages	1
and	1
in	1
knights-errant.	1
For	1
tell	1
me,	1
who	1
was	1
more	1
virtuous	1
and	1
more	1
valiant	1
than	1
the	1
famous	1
Amadis	1
of	1
Gaul?	1
Who	1
more	1
discreet	1
than	1
Palmerin	1
of	1
England?	1
Who	1
more	1
gracious	1
and	1
easy	1
than	1
Tirante	1
el	1
Blanco?	1
Who	1
more	1
courtly	1
than	1
Lisuarte	1
of	1
Greece?	1
Who	1
more	1
slashed	1
or	1
slashing	1
than	1
Don	1
Belianis?	1
Who	1
more	1
intrepid	1
than	1
Perion	1
of	1
Gaul?	1
Who	1
more	1
ready	1
to	1
face	1
danger	1
than	1
Felixmarte	1
of	1
Hircania?	1
Who	1
more	1
sincere	1
than	1
Esplandian?	1
Who	1
more	1
impetuous	1
than	1
Don	1
Cirongilio	1
of	1
Thrace?	1
Who	1
more	1
bold	1
than	1
Rodamonte?	1
Who	1
more	1
prudent	1
than	1
King	1
Sobrino?	1
Who	1
more	1
daring	1
than	1
Reinaldos?	1
Who	1
more	1
invincible	1
than	1
Roland?	1
and	1
who	1
more	1
gallant	1
and	1
courteous	1
than	1
Ruggiero,	1
from	1
whom	1
the	1
dukes	1
of	1
Ferrara	1
of	1
the	1
present	1
day	1
are	1
descended,	1
according	1
to	1
Turpin	1
in	1
his	1
‘Cosmography.’	1
All	1
these	1
knights,	1
and	1
many	1
more	1
that	1
I	1
could	1
name,	1
señor	1
curate,	1
were	1
knights-errant,	1
the	1
light	1
and	1
glory	1
of	1
chivalry.	1
These,	1
or	1
such	1
as	1
these,	1
I	1
would	1
have	1
to	1
carry	1
out	1
my	1
plan,	1
and	1
in	1
that	1
case	1
his	1
Majesty	1
would	1
find	1
himself	1
well	1
served	1
and	1
would	1
save	1
great	1
expense,	1
and	1
the	1
Turk	1
would	1
be	1
left	1
tearing	1
his	1
beard.	1
And	1
so	1
I	1
will	1
stay	1
where	1
I	1
am,	1
as	1
the	1
chaplain	1
does	1
not	1
take	1
me	1
away;	1
and	1
if	1
Jupiter,	1
as	1
the	1
barber	1
has	1
told	1
us,	1
will	1
not	1
send	1
rain,	1
here	1
am	1
I,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
rain	1
when	1
I	1
please.	1
I	1
say	1
this	1
that	1
Master	1
Basin	1
may	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
understand	1
him.”	1
“Indeed,	1
Señor	1
Don	1
Quixote,”	1
said	1
the	1
barber,	1
“I	1
did	1
not	1
mean	1
it	1
in	1
that	1
way,	1
and,	1
so	1
help	1
me	1
God,	1
my	1
intention	1
was	1
good,	1
and	1
your	1
worship	1
ought	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
vexed.”	1
“As	1
to	1
whether	1
I	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
vexed	1
or	1
not,”	1
returned	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“I	1
myself	1
am	1
the	1
best	1
judge.”	1
Hereupon	1
the	1
curate	1
observed,	1
“I	1
have	1
hardly	1
said	1
a	1
word	1
as	1
yet;	1
and	1
I	1
would	1
gladly	1
be	1
relieved	1
of	1
a	1
doubt,	1
arising	1
from	1
what	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
has	1
said,	1
that	1
worries	1
and	1
works	1
my	1
conscience.”	1
“The	1
señor	1
curate	1
has	1
leave	1
for	1
more	1
than	1
that,”	1
returned	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“so	1
he	1
may	1
declare	1
his	1
doubt,	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
pleasant	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
doubt	1
on	1
one’s	1
conscience.”	1
“Well	1
then,	1
with	1
that	1
permission,”	1
said	1
the	1
curate,	1
“I	1
say	1
my	1
doubt	1
is	1
that,	1
all	1
I	1
can	1
do,	1
I	1
cannot	1
persuade	1
myself	1
that	1
the	1
whole	1
pack	1
of	1
knights-errant	1
you,	1
Señor	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
have	1
mentioned,	1
were	1
really	1
and	1
truly	1
persons	1
of	1
flesh	1
and	1
blood,	1
that	1
ever	1
lived	1
in	1
the	1
world;	1
on	1
the	1
contrary,	1
I	1
suspect	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
all	1
fiction,	1
fable,	1
and	1
falsehood,	1
and	1
dreams	1
told	1
by	1
men	1
awakened	1
from	1
sleep,	1
or	1
rather	1
still	1
half	1
asleep.”	1
“That	1
is	1
another	1
mistake,”	1
replied	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“into	1
which	1
many	1
have	1
fallen	1
who	1
do	1
not	1
believe	1
that	1
there	1
ever	1
were	1
such	1
knights	1
in	1
the	1
world,	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
often,	1
with	1
divers	1
people	1
and	1
on	1
divers	1
occasions,	1
tried	1
to	1
expose	1
this	1
almost	1
universal	1
error	1
to	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
truth.	1
Sometimes	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
been	1
successful	1
in	1
my	1
purpose,	1
sometimes	1
I	1
have,	1
supporting	1
it	1
upon	1
the	1
shoulders	1
of	1
the	1
truth;	1
which	1
truth	1
is	1
so	1
clear	1
that	1
I	1
can	1
almost	1
say	1
I	1
have	1
with	1
my	1
own	1
eyes	1
seen	1
Amadis	1
of	1
Gaul,	1
who	1
was	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
lofty	1
stature,	1
fair	1
complexion,	1
with	1
a	1
handsome	1
though	1
black	1
beard,	1
of	1
a	1
countenance	1
between	1
gentle	1
and	1
stern	1
in	1
expression,	1
sparing	1
of	1
words,	1
slow	1
to	1
anger,	1
and	1
quick	1
to	1
put	1
it	1
away	1
from	1
him;	1
and	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
depicted	1
Amadis,	1
so	1
I	1
could,	1
I	1
think,	1
portray	1
and	1
describe	1
all	1
the	1
knights-errant	1
that	1
are	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
histories	1
in	1
the	1
world;	1
for	1
by	1
the	1
perception	1
I	1
have	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
what	1
their	1
histories	1
describe,	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
deeds	1
they	1
did	1
and	1
the	1
dispositions	1
they	1
displayed,	1
it	1
is	1
possible,	1
with	1
the	1
aid	1
of	1
sound	1
philosophy,	1
to	1
deduce	1
their	1
features,	1
complexion,	1
and	1
stature.”	1
“How	1
big,	1
in	1
your	1
worship’s	1
opinion,	1
may	1
the	1
giant	1
Morgante	1
have	1
been,	1
Señor	1
Don	1
Quixote?”	1
asked	1
the	1
barber.	1
“With	1
regard	1
to	1
giants,”	1
replied	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“opinions	1
differ	1
as	1
to	1
whether	1
there	1
ever	1
were	1
any	1
or	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
world;	1
but	1
the	1
Holy	1
Scripture,	1
which	1
cannot	1
err	1
by	1
a	1
jot	1
from	1
the	1
truth,	1
shows	1
us	1
that	1
there	1
were,	1
when	1
it	1
gives	1
us	1
the	1
history	1
of	1
that	1
big	1
Philistine,	1
Goliath,	1
who	1
was	1
seven	1
cubits	1
and	1
a	1
half	1
in	1
height,	1
which	1
is	1
a	1
huge	1
size.	1
Likewise,	1
in	1
the	1
island	1
of	1
Sicily,	1
there	1
have	1
been	1
found	1
leg-bones	1
and	1
arm-bones	1
so	1
large	1
that	1
their	1
size	1
makes	1
it	1
plain	1
that	1
their	1
owners	1
were	1
giants,	1
and	1
as	1
tall	1
as	1
great	1
towers;	1
geometry	1
puts	1
this	1
fact	1
beyond	1
a	1
doubt.	1
But,	1
for	1
all	1
that,	1
I	1
cannot	1
speak	1
with	1
certainty	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
size	1
of	1
Morgante,	1
though	1
I	1
suspect	1
he	1
cannot	1
have	1
been	1
very	1
tall;	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
inclined	1
to	1
be	1
of	1
this	1
opinion	1
because	1
I	1
find	1
in	1
the	1
history	1
in	1
which	1
his	1
deeds	1
are	1
particularly	1
mentioned,	1
that	1
he	1
frequently	1
slept	1
under	1
a	1
roof	1
and	1
as	1
he	1
found	1
houses	1
to	1
contain	1
him,	1
it	1
is	1
clear	1
that	1
his	1
bulk	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
been	1
anything	1
excessive.”	1
“That	1
is	1
true,”	1
said	1
the	1
curate,	1
and	1
yielding	1
to	1
the	1
enjoyment	1
of	1
hearing	1
such	1
nonsense,	1
he	1
asked	1
him	1
what	1
was	1
his	1
notion	1
of	1
the	1
features	1
of	1
Reinaldos	1
of	1
Montalban,	1
and	1
Don	1
Roland	1
and	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
Twelve	1
Peers	1
of	1
France,	1
for	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
knights-errant.	1
“As	1
for	1
Reinaldos,”	1
replied	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“I	1
venture	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
broad-faced,	1
of	1
ruddy	1
complexion,	1
with	1
roguish	1
and	1
somewhat	1
prominent	1
eyes,	1
excessively	1
punctilious	1
and	1
touchy,	1
and	1
given	1
to	1
the	1
society	1
of	1
thieves	1
and	1
scapegraces.	1
With	1
regard	1
to	1
Roland,	1
or	1
Rotolando,	1
or	1
Orlando	1
(for	1
the	1
histories	1
call	1
him	1
by	1
all	1
these	1
names),	1
I	1
am	1
of	1
opinion,	1
and	1
hold,	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
of	1
middle	1
height,	1
broad-shouldered,	1
rather	1
bow-legged,	1
swarthy-complexioned,	1
red-bearded,	1
with	1
a	1
hairy	1
body	1
and	1
a	1
severe	1
expression	1
of	1
countenance,	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
few	1
words,	1
but	1
very	1
polite	1
and	1
well-bred.”	1
“If	1
Roland	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
more	1
graceful	1
person	1
than	1
your	1
worship	1
has	1
described,”	1
said	1
the	1
curate,	1
“it	1
is	1
no	1
wonder	1
that	1
the	1
fair	1
Lady	1
Angelica	1
rejected	1
him	1
and	1
left	1
him	1
for	1
the	1
gaiety,	1
liveliness,	1
and	1
grace	1
of	1
that	1
budding-bearded	1
little	1
Moor	1
to	1
whom	1
she	1
surrendered	1
herself;	1
and	1
she	1
showed	1
her	1
sense	1
in	1
falling	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
the	1
gentle	1
softness	1
of	1
Medoro	1
rather	1
than	1
the	1
roughness	1
of	1
Roland.”	1
“That	1
Angelica,	1
señor	1
curate,”	1
returned	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“was	1
a	1
giddy	1
damsel,	1
flighty	1
and	1
somewhat	1
wanton,	1
and	1
she	1
left	1
the	1
world	1
as	1
full	1
of	1
her	1
vagaries	1
as	1
of	1
the	1
fame	1
of	1
her	1
beauty.	1
She	1
treated	1
with	1
scorn	1
a	1
thousand	1
gentlemen,	1
men	1
of	1
valour	1
and	1
wisdom,	1
and	1
took	1
up	1
with	1
a	1
smooth-faced	1
sprig	1
of	1
a	1
page,	1
without	1
fortune	1
or	1
fame,	1
except	1
such	1
reputation	1
for	1
gratitude	1
as	1
the	1
affection	1
he	1
bore	1
his	1
friend	1
got	1
for	1
him.	1
The	1
great	1
poet	1
who	1
sang	1
her	1
beauty,	1
the	1
famous	1
Ariosto,	1
not	1
caring	1
to	1
sing	1
her	1
adventures	1
after	1
her	1
contemptible	1
surrender	1
(which	1
probably	1
were	1
not	1
over	1
and	1
above	1
creditable),	1
dropped	1
her	1
where	1
he	1
says:	1
How	1
she	1
received	1
the	1
sceptre	1
of	1
Cathay,	1
Some	1
bard	1
of	1
defter	1
quill	1
may	1
sing	1
some	1
day;	1
and	1
this	1
was	1
no	1
doubt	1
a	1
kind	1
of	1
prophecy,	1
for	1
poets	1
are	1
also	1
called	1
_vates_,	1
that	1
is	1
to	1
say	1
diviners;	1
and	1
its	1
truth	1
was	1
made	1
plain;	1
for	1
since	1
then	1
a	1
famous	1
Andalusian	1
poet	1
has	1
lamented	1
and	1
sung	1
her	1
tears,	1
and	1
another	1
famous	1
and	1
rare	1
poet,	1
a	1
Castilian,	1
has	1
sung	1
her	1
beauty.”	1
“Tell	1
me,	1
Señor	1
Don	1
Quixote,”	1
said	1
the	1
barber	1
here,	1
“among	1
all	1
those	1
who	1
praised	1
her,	1
has	1
there	1
been	1
no	1
poet	1
to	1
write	1
a	1
satire	1
on	1
this	1
Lady	1
Angelica?”	1
“I	1
can	1
well	1
believe,”	1
replied	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“that	1
if	1
Sacripante	1
or	1
Roland	1
had	1
been	1
poets	1
they	1
would	1
have	1
given	1
the	1
damsel	1
a	1
trimming;	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
naturally	1
the	1
way	1
with	1
poets	1
who	1
have	1
been	1
scorned	1
and	1
rejected	1
by	1
their	1
ladies,	1
whether	1
fictitious	1
or	1
not,	1
in	1
short	1
by	1
those	1
whom	1
they	1
select	1
as	1
the	1
ladies	1
of	1
their	1
thoughts,	1
to	1
avenge	1
themselves	1
in	1
satires	1
and	1
libels—a	1
vengeance,	1
to	1
be	1
sure,	1
unworthy	1
of	1
generous	1
hearts;	1
but	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
present	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
heard	1
of	1
any	1
defamatory	1
verse	1
against	1
the	1
Lady	1
Angelica,	1
who	1
turned	1
the	1
world	1
upside	1
down.”	1
“Strange,”	1
said	1
the	1
curate;	1
but	1
at	1
this	1
moment	1
they	1
heard	1
the	1
housekeeper	1
and	1
the	1
niece,	1
who	1
had	1
previously	1
withdrawn	1
from	1
the	1
conversation,	1
exclaiming	1
aloud	1
in	1
the	1
courtyard,	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
noise	1
they	1
all	1
ran	1
out.	1

The	1
history	1
relates	1
that	1
the	1
outcry	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
the	1
curate,	1
and	1
the	1
barber	1
heard	1
came	1
from	1
the	1
niece	1
and	1
the	1
housekeeper	1
exclaiming	1
to	1
Sancho,	1
who	1
was	1
striving	1
to	1
force	1
his	1
way	1
in	1
to	1
see	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
while	1
they	1
held	1
the	1
door	1
against	1
him,	1
“What	1
does	1
the	1
vagabond	1
want	1
in	1
this	1
house?	1
Be	1
off	1
to	1
your	1
own,	1
brother,	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
you,	1
and	1
no	1
one	1
else,	1
that	1
delude	1
my	1
master,	1
and	1
lead	1
him	1
astray,	1
and	1
take	1
him	1
tramping	1
about	1
the	1
country.”	1
To	1
which	1
Sancho	1
replied,	1
“Devil’s	1
own	1
housekeeper!	1
it	1
is	1
I	1
who	1
am	1
deluded,	1
and	1
led	1
astray,	1
and	1
taken	1
tramping	1
about	1
the	1
country,	1
and	1
not	1
thy	1
master!	1
He	1
has	1
carried	1
me	1
all	1
over	1
the	1
world,	1
and	1
you	1
are	1
mightily	1
mistaken.	1
He	1
enticed	1
me	1
away	1
from	1
home	1
by	1
a	1
trick,	1
promising	1
me	1
an	1
island,	1
which	1
I	1
am	1
still	1
waiting	1
for.”	1
“May	1
evil	1
islands	1
choke	1
thee,	1
thou	1
detestable	1
Sancho,”	1
said	1
the	1
niece;	1
“What	1
are	1
islands?	1
Is	1
it	1
something	1
to	1
eat,	1
glutton	1
and	1
gormandiser	1
that	1
thou	1
art?”	1
“It	1
is	1
not	1
something	1
to	1
eat,”	1
replied	1
Sancho,	1
“but	1
something	1
to	1
govern	1
and	1
rule,	1
and	1
better	1
than	1
four	1
cities	1
or	1
four	1
judgeships	1
at	1
court.”	1
“For	1
all	1
that,”	1
said	1
the	1
housekeeper,	1
“you	1
don’t	1
enter	1
here,	1
you	1
bag	1
of	1
mischief	1
and	1
sack	1
of	1
knavery;	1
go	1
govern	1
your	1
house	1
and	1
dig	1
your	1
seed-patch,	1
and	1
give	1
over	1
looking	1
for	1
islands	1
or	1
shylands.”	1
The	1
curate	1
and	1
the	1
barber	1
listened	1
with	1
great	1
amusement	1
to	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
three;	1
but	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
uneasy	1
lest	1
Sancho	1
should	1
blab	1
and	1
blurt	1
out	1
a	1
whole	1
heap	1
of	1
mischievous	1
stupidities,	1
and	1
touch	1
upon	1
points	1
that	1
might	1
not	1
be	1
altogether	1
to	1
his	1
credit,	1
called	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
made	1
the	1
other	1
two	1
hold	1
their	1
tongues	1
and	1
let	1
him	1
come	1
in.	1
Sancho	1
entered,	1
and	1
the	1
curate	1
and	1
the	1
barber	1
took	1
their	1
leave	1
of	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
of	1
whose	1
recovery	1
they	1
despaired	1
when	1
they	1
saw	1
how	1
wedded	1
he	1
was	1
to	1
his	1
crazy	1
ideas,	1
and	1
how	1
saturated	1
with	1
the	1
nonsense	1
of	1
his	1
unlucky	1
chivalry;	1
and	1
said	1
the	1
curate	1
to	1
the	1
barber,	1
“You	1
will	1
see,	1
gossip,	1
that	1
when	1
we	1
are	1
least	1
thinking	1
of	1
it,	1
our	1
gentleman	1
will	1
be	1
off	1
once	1
more	1
for	1
another	1
flight.”	1
“I	1
have	1
no	1
doubt	1
of	1
it,”	1
returned	1
the	1
barber;	1
“but	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
wonder	1
so	1
much	1
at	1
the	1
madness	1
of	1
the	1
knight	1
as	1
at	1
the	1
simplicity	1
of	1
the	1
squire,	1
who	1
has	1
such	1
a	1
firm	1
belief	1
in	1
all	1
that	1
about	1
the	1
island,	1
that	1
I	1
suppose	1
all	1
the	1
exposures	1
that	1
could	1
be	1
imagined	1
would	1
not	1
get	1
it	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
head.”	1
“God	1
help	1
them,”	1
said	1
the	1
curate;	1
“and	1
let	1
us	1
be	1
on	1
the	1
look-out	1
to	1
see	1
what	1
comes	1
of	1
all	1
these	1
absurdities	1
of	1
the	1
knight	1
and	1
squire,	1
for	1
it	1
seems	1
as	1
if	1
they	1
had	1
both	1
been	1
cast	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
mould,	1
and	1
the	1
madness	1
of	1
the	1
master	1
without	1
the	1
simplicity	1
of	1
the	1
man	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
worth	1
a	1
farthing.”	1
“That	1
is	1
true,”	1
said	1
the	1
barber,	1
“and	1
I	1
should	1
like	1
very	1
much	1
to	1
know	1
what	1
the	1
pair	1
are	1
talking	1
about	1
at	1
this	1
moment.”	1
“I	1
promise	1
you,”	1
said	1
the	1
curate,	1
“the	1
niece	1
or	1
the	1
housekeeper	1
will	1
tell	1
us	1
by-and-by,	1
for	1
they	1
are	1
not	1
the	1
ones	1
to	1
forget	1
to	1
listen.”	1
Meanwhile	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
shut	1
himself	1
up	1
in	1
his	1
room	1
with	1
Sancho,	1
and	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
alone	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
him,	1
“It	1
grieves	1
me	1
greatly,	1
Sancho,	1
that	1
thou	1
shouldst	1
have	1
said,	1
and	1
sayest,	1
that	1
I	1
took	1
thee	1
out	1
of	1
thy	1
cottage,	1
when	1
thou	1
knowest	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
remain	1
in	1
my	1
house.	1
We	1
sallied	1
forth	1
together,	1
we	1
took	1
the	1
road	1
together,	1
we	1
wandered	1
abroad	1
together;	1
we	1
have	1
had	1
the	1
same	1
fortune	1
and	1
the	1
same	1
luck;	1
if	1
they	1
blanketed	1
thee	1
once,	1
they	1
belaboured	1
me	1
a	1
hundred	1
times,	1
and	1
that	1
is	1
the	1
only	1
advantage	1
I	1
have	1
of	1
thee.”	1
“That	1
was	1
only	1
reasonable,”	1
replied	1
Sancho,	1
“for,	1
by	1
what	1
your	1
worship	1
says,	1
misfortunes	1
belong	1
more	1
properly	1
to	1
knights-errant	1
than	1
to	1
their	1
squires.”	1
“Thou	1
art	1
mistaken,	1
Sancho,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“according	1
to	1
the	1
maxim	1
_quando	1
caput	1
dolet_,	1
etc.”	1
“I	1
don’t	1
understand	1
any	1
language	1
but	1
my	1
own,”	1
said	1
Sancho.	1
“I	1
mean	1
to	1
say,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“that	1
when	1
the	1
head	1
suffers	1
all	1
the	1
members	1
suffer;	1
and	1
so,	1
being	1
thy	1
lord	1
and	1
master,	1
I	1
am	1
thy	1
head,	1
and	1
thou	1
a	1
part	1
of	1
me	1
as	1
thou	1
art	1
my	1
servant;	1
and	1
therefore	1
any	1
evil	1
that	1
affects	1
or	1
shall	1
affect	1
me	1
should	1
give	1
thee	1
pain,	1
and	1
what	1
affects	1
thee	1
give	1
pain	1
to	1
me.”	1
“It	1
should	1
be	1
so,”	1
said	1
Sancho;	1
“but	1
when	1
I	1
was	1
blanketed	1
as	1
a	1
member,	1
my	1
head	1
was	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
wall,	1
looking	1
on	1
while	1
I	1
was	1
flying	1
through	1
the	1
air,	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
feel	1
any	1
pain	1
whatever;	1
and	1
if	1
the	1
members	1
are	1
obliged	1
to	1
feel	1
the	1
suffering	1
of	1
the	1
head,	1
it	1
should	1
be	1
obliged	1
to	1
feel	1
their	1
sufferings.”	1
“Dost	1
thou	1
mean	1
to	1
say	1
now,	1
Sancho,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“that	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
feel	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
blanketing	1
thee?	1
If	1
thou	1
dost,	1
thou	1
must	1
not	1
say	1
so	1
or	1
think	1
so,	1
for	1
I	1
felt	1
more	1
pain	1
then	1
in	1
spirit	1
than	1
thou	1
didst	1
in	1
body.	1
But	1
let	1
us	1
put	1
that	1
aside	1
for	1
the	1
present,	1
for	1
we	1
shall	1
have	1
opportunities	1
enough	1
for	1
considering	1
and	1
settling	1
the	1
point;	1
tell	1
me,	1
Sancho	1
my	1
friend,	1
what	1
do	1
they	1
say	1
about	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
village	1
here?	1
What	1
do	1
the	1
common	1
people	1
think	1
of	1
me?	1
What	1
do	1
the	1
hidalgos?	1
What	1
do	1
the	1
caballeros?	1
What	1
do	1
they	1
say	1
of	1
my	1
valour;	1
of	1
my	1
achievements;	1
of	1
my	1
courtesy?	1
How	1
do	1
they	1
treat	1
the	1
task	1
I	1
have	1
undertaken	1
in	1
reviving	1
and	1
restoring	1
to	1
the	1
world	1
the	1
now	1
forgotten	1
order	1
of	1
chivalry?	1
In	1
short,	1
Sancho,	1
I	1
would	1
have	1
thee	1
tell	1
me	1
all	1
that	1
has	1
come	1
to	1
thine	1
ears	1
on	1
this	1
subject;	1
and	1
thou	1
art	1
to	1
tell	1
me,	1
without	1
adding	1
anything	1
to	1
the	1
good	1
or	1
taking	1
away	1
anything	1
from	1
the	1
bad;	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
duty	1
of	1
loyal	1
vassals	1
to	1
tell	1
the	1
truth	1
to	1
their	1
lords	1
just	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
and	1
in	1
its	1
proper	1
shape,	1
not	1
allowing	1
flattery	1
to	1
add	1
to	1
it	1
or	1
any	1
idle	1
deference	1
to	1
lessen	1
it.	1
And	1
I	1
would	1
have	1
thee	1
know,	1
Sancho,	1
that	1
if	1
the	1
naked	1
truth,	1
undisguised	1
by	1
flattery,	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
ears	1
of	1
princes,	1
times	1
would	1
be	1
different,	1
and	1
other	1
ages	1
would	1
be	1
reckoned	1
iron	1
ages	1
more	1
than	1
ours,	1
which	1
I	1
hold	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
golden	1
of	1
these	1
latter	1
days.	1
Profit	1
by	1
this	1
advice,	1
Sancho,	1
and	1
report	1
to	1
me	1
clearly	1
and	1
faithfully	1
the	1
truth	1
of	1
what	1
thou	1
knowest	1
touching	1
what	1
I	1
have	1
demanded	1
of	1
thee.”	1
“That	1
I	1
will	1
do	1
with	1
all	1
my	1
heart,	1
master,”	1
replied	1
Sancho,	1
“provided	1
your	1
worship	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
vexed	1
at	1
what	1
I	1
say,	1
as	1
you	1
wish	1
me	1
to	1
say	1
it	1
out	1
in	1
all	1
its	1
nakedness,	1
without	1
putting	1
any	1
more	1
clothes	1
on	1
it	1
than	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
my	1
knowledge	1
in.”	1
“I	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
vexed	1
at	1
all,”	1
returned	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
“thou	1
mayest	1
speak	1
freely,	1
Sancho,	1
and	1
without	1
any	1
beating	1
about	1
the	1
bush.”	1
“Well	1
then,”	1
said	1
he,	1
“first	1
of	1
all,	1
I	1
have	1
to	1
tell	1
you	1
that	1
the	1
common	1
people	1
consider	1
your	1
worship	1
a	1
mighty	1
great	1
madman,	1
and	1
me	1
no	1
less	1
a	1
fool.	1
The	1
hidalgos	1
say	1
that,	1
not	1
keeping	1
within	1
the	1
bounds	1
of	1
your	1
quality	1
of	1
gentleman,	1
you	1
have	1
assumed	1
the	1
‘Don,’	1
and	1
made	1
a	1
knight	1
of	1
yourself	1
at	1
a	1
jump,	1
with	1
four	1
vine-stocks	1
and	1
a	1
couple	1
of	1
acres	1
of	1
land,	1
and	1
never	1
a	1
shirt	1
to	1
your	1
back.	1
The	1
caballeros	1
say	1
they	1
do	1
not	1
want	1
to	1
have	1
hidalgos	1
setting	1
up	1
in	1
opposition	1
to	1
them,	1
particularly	1
squire	1
hidalgos	1
who	1
polish	1
their	1
own	1
shoes	1
and	1
darn	1
their	1
black	1
stockings	1
with	1
green	1
silk.”	1
“That,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“does	1
not	1
apply	1
to	1
me,	1
for	1
I	1
always	1
go	1
well	1
dressed	1
and	1
never	1
patched;	1
ragged	1
I	1
may	1
be,	1
but	1
ragged	1
more	1
from	1
the	1
wear	1
and	1
tear	1
of	1
arms	1
than	1
of	1
time.”	1
“As	1
to	1
your	1
worship’s	1
valour,	1
courtesy,	1
accomplishments,	1
and	1
task,	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
variety	1
of	1
opinions.	1
Some	1
say,	1
‘mad	1
but	1
droll;’	1
others,	1
‘valiant	1
but	1
unlucky;’	1
others,	1
‘courteous	1
but	1
meddling,’	1
and	1
then	1
they	1
go	1
into	1
such	1
a	1
number	1
of	1
things	1
that	1
they	1
don’t	1
leave	1
a	1
whole	1
bone	1
either	1
in	1
your	1
worship	1
or	1
in	1
myself.”	1
“Recollect,	1
Sancho,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“that	1
wherever	1
virtue	1
exists	1
in	1
an	1
eminent	1
degree	1
it	1
is	1
persecuted.	1
Few	1
or	1
none	1
of	1
the	1
famous	1
men	1
that	1
have	1
lived	1
escaped	1
being	1
calumniated	1
by	1
malice.	1
Julius	1
Cæsar,	1
the	1
boldest,	1
wisest,	1
and	1
bravest	1
of	1
captains,	1
was	1
charged	1
with	1
being	1
ambitious,	1
and	1
not	1
particularly	1
cleanly	1
in	1
his	1
dress,	1
or	1
pure	1
in	1
his	1
morals.	1
Of	1
Alexander,	1
whose	1
deeds	1
won	1
him	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Great,	1
they	1
say	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
somewhat	1
of	1
a	1
drunkard.	1
Of	1
Hercules,	1
him	1
of	1
the	1
many	1
labours,	1
it	1
is	1
said	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
lewd	1
and	1
luxurious.	1
Of	1
Don	1
Galaor,	1
the	1
brother	1
of	1
Amadis	1
of	1
Gaul,	1
it	1
was	1
whispered	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
over-quarrelsome,	1
and	1
of	1
his	1
brother	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
lachrymose.	1
So	1
that,	1
O	1
Sancho,	1
amongst	1
all	1
these	1
calumnies	1
against	1
good	1
men,	1
mine	1
may	1
be	1
let	1
pass,	1
since	1
they	1
are	1
no	1
more	1
than	1
thou	1
hast	1
said.”	1
“That’s	1
just	1
where	1
it	1
is,	1
body	1
of	1
my	1
father!”	1
“Is	1
there	1
more,	1
then?”	1
asked	1
Don	1
Quixote.	1
“There’s	1
the	1
tail	1
to	1
be	1
skinned	1
yet,”	1
said	1
Sancho;	1
“all	1
so	1
far	1
is	1
cakes	1
and	1
fancy	1
bread;	1
but	1
if	1
your	1
worship	1
wants	1
to	1
know	1
all	1
about	1
the	1
calumnies	1
they	1
bring	1
against	1
you,	1
I	1
will	1
fetch	1
you	1
one	1
this	1
instant	1
who	1
can	1
tell	1
you	1
the	1
whole	1
of	1
them	1
without	1
missing	1
an	1
atom;	1
for	1
last	1
night	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Bartholomew	1
Carrasco,	1
who	1
has	1
been	1
studying	1
at	1
Salamanca,	1
came	1
home	1
after	1
having	1
been	1
made	1
a	1
bachelor,	1
and	1
when	1
I	1
went	1
to	1
welcome	1
him,	1
he	1
told	1
me	1
that	1
your	1
worship’s	1
history	1
is	1
already	1
abroad	1
in	1
books,	1
with	1
the	1
title	1
of	1
THE	1
INGENIOUS	1
GENTLEMAN	1
DON	1
QUIXOTE	1
OF	1
LA	1
MANCHA;	1
and	1
he	1
says	1
they	1
mention	1
me	1
in	1
it	1
by	1
my	1
own	1
name	1
of	1
Sancho	1
Panza,	1
and	1
the	1
lady	1
Dulcinea	1
del	1
Toboso	1
too,	1
and	1
divers	1
things	1
that	1
happened	1
to	1
us	1
when	1
we	1
were	1
alone;	1
so	1
that	1
I	1
crossed	1
myself	1
in	1
my	1
wonder	1
how	1
the	1
historian	1
who	1
wrote	1
them	1
down	1
could	1
have	1
known	1
them.”	1
“I	1
promise	1
thee,	1
Sancho,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“the	1
author	1
of	1
our	1
history	1
will	1
be	1
some	1
sage	1
enchanter;	1
for	1
to	1
such	1
nothing	1
that	1
they	1
choose	1
to	1
write	1
about	1
is	1
hidden.”	1
“What!”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“a	1
sage	1
and	1
an	1
enchanter!	1
Why,	1
the	1
bachelor	1
Samson	1
Carrasco	1
(that	1
is	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
him	1
I	1
spoke	1
of)	1
says	1
the	1
author	1
of	1
the	1
history	1
is	1
called	1
Cide	1
Hamete	1
Berengena.”	1
“That	1
is	1
a	1
Moorish	1
name,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote.	1
“May	1
be	1
so,”	1
replied	1
Sancho;	1
“for	1
I	1
have	1
heard	1
say	1
that	1
the	1
Moors	1
are	1
mostly	1
great	1
lovers	1
of	1
berengenas.”	1
“Thou	1
must	1
have	1
mistaken	1
the	1
surname	1
of	1
this	1
‘Cide’—which	1
means	1
in	1
Arabic	1
‘Lord’—Sancho,”	1
observed	1
Don	1
Quixote.	1
“Very	1
likely,”	1
replied	1
Sancho,	1
“but	1
if	1
your	1
worship	1
wishes	1
me	1
to	1
fetch	1
the	1
bachelor	1
I	1
will	1
go	1
for	1
him	1
in	1
a	1
twinkling.”	1
“Thou	1
wilt	1
do	1
me	1
a	1
great	1
pleasure,	1
my	1
friend,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“for	1
what	1
thou	1
hast	1
told	1
me	1
has	1
amazed	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
shall	1
not	1
eat	1
a	1
morsel	1
that	1
will	1
agree	1
with	1
me	1
until	1
I	1
have	1
heard	1
all	1
about	1
it.”	1
“Then	1
I	1
am	1
off	1
for	1
him,”	1
said	1
Sancho;	1
and	1
leaving	1
his	1
master	1
he	1
went	1
in	1
quest	1
of	1
the	1
bachelor,	1
with	1
whom	1
he	1
returned	1
in	1
a	1
short	1
time,	1
and,	1
all	1
three	1
together,	1
they	1
had	1
a	1
very	1
droll	1
colloquy.	1

Don	1
Quixote	1
remained	1
very	1
deep	1
in	1
thought,	1
waiting	1
for	1
the	1
bachelor	1
Carrasco,	1
from	1
whom	1
he	1
was	1
to	1
hear	1
how	1
he	1
himself	1
had	1
been	1
put	1
into	1
a	1
book	1
as	1
Sancho	1
said;	1
and	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
persuade	1
himself	1
that	1
any	1
such	1
history	1
could	1
be	1
in	1
existence,	1
for	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
the	1
enemies	1
he	1
had	1
slain	1
was	1
not	1
yet	1
dry	1
on	1
the	1
blade	1
of	1
his	1
sword,	1
and	1
now	1
they	1
wanted	1
to	1
make	1
out	1
that	1
his	1
mighty	1
achievements	1
were	1
going	1
about	1
in	1
print.	1
For	1
all	1
that,	1
he	1
fancied	1
some	1
sage,	1
either	1
a	1
friend	1
or	1
an	1
enemy,	1
might,	1
by	1
the	1
aid	1
of	1
magic,	1
have	1
given	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
press;	1
if	1
a	1
friend,	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
magnify	1
and	1
exalt	1
them	1
above	1
the	1
most	1
famous	1
ever	1
achieved	1
by	1
any	1
knight-errant;	1
if	1
an	1
enemy,	1
to	1
bring	1
them	1
to	1
naught	1
and	1
degrade	1
them	1
below	1
the	1
meanest	1
ever	1
recorded	1
of	1
any	1
low	1
squire,	1
though	1
as	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
himself,	1
the	1
achievements	1
of	1
squires	1
never	1
were	1
recorded.	1
If,	1
however,	1
it	1
were	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
such	1
a	1
history	1
were	1
in	1
existence,	1
it	1
must	1
necessarily,	1
being	1
the	1
story	1
of	1
a	1
knight-errant,	1
be	1
grandiloquent,	1
lofty,	1
imposing,	1
grand	1
and	1
true.	1
With	1
this	1
he	1
comforted	1
himself	1
somewhat,	1
though	1
it	1
made	1
him	1
uncomfortable	1
to	1
think	1
that	1
the	1
author	1
was	1
a	1
Moor,	1
judging	1
by	1
the	1
title	1
of	1
“Cide;”	1
and	1
that	1
no	1
truth	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
looked	1
for	1
from	1
Moors,	1
as	1
they	1
are	1
all	1
impostors,	1
cheats,	1
and	1
schemers.	1
He	1
was	1
afraid	1
he	1
might	1
have	1
dealt	1
with	1
his	1
love	1
affairs	1
in	1
some	1
indecorous	1
fashion,	1
that	1
might	1
tend	1
to	1
the	1
discredit	1
and	1
prejudice	1
of	1
the	1
purity	1
of	1
his	1
lady	1
Dulcinea	1
del	1
Toboso;	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
had	1
him	1
set	1
forth	1
the	1
fidelity	1
and	1
respect	1
he	1
had	1
always	1
observed	1
towards	1
her,	1
spurning	1
queens,	1
empresses,	1
and	1
damsels	1
of	1
all	1
sorts,	1
and	1
keeping	1
in	1
check	1
the	1
impetuosity	1
of	1
his	1
natural	1
impulses.	1
Absorbed	1
and	1
wrapped	1
up	1
in	1
these	1
and	1
divers	1
other	1
cogitations,	1
he	1
was	1
found	1
by	1
Sancho	1
and	1
Carrasco,	1
whom	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
received	1
with	1
great	1
courtesy.	1
The	1
bachelor,	1
though	1
he	1
was	1
called	1
Samson,	1
was	1
of	1
no	1
great	1
bodily	1
size,	1
but	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
very	1
great	1
wag;	1
he	1
was	1
of	1
a	1
sallow	1
complexion,	1
but	1
very	1
sharp-witted,	1
somewhere	1
about	1
four-and-twenty	1
years	1
of	1
age,	1
with	1
a	1
round	1
face,	1
a	1
flat	1
nose,	1
and	1
a	1
large	1
mouth,	1
all	1
indications	1
of	1
a	1
mischievous	1
disposition	1
and	1
a	1
love	1
of	1
fun	1
and	1
jokes;	1
and	1
of	1
this	1
he	1
gave	1
a	1
sample	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
saw	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
by	1
falling	1
on	1
his	1
knees	1
before	1
him	1
and	1
saying,	1
“Let	1
me	1
kiss	1
your	1
mightiness’s	1
hand,	1
Señor	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
of	1
La	1
Mancha,	1
for,	1
by	1
the	1
habit	1
of	1
St.	1
Peter	1
that	1
I	1
wear,	1
though	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
more	1
than	1
the	1
first	1
four	1
orders,	1
your	1
worship	1
is	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
famous	1
knights-errant	1
that	1
have	1
ever	1
been,	1
or	1
will	1
be,	1
all	1
the	1
world	1
over.	1
A	1
blessing	1
on	1
Cide	1
Hamete	1
Benengeli,	1
who	1
has	1
written	1
the	1
history	1
of	1
your	1
great	1
deeds,	1
and	1
a	1
double	1
blessing	1
on	1
that	1
connoisseur	1
who	1
took	1
the	1
trouble	1
of	1
having	1
it	1
translated	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
Arabic	1
into	1
our	1
Castilian	1
vulgar	1
tongue	1
for	1
the	1
universal	1
entertainment	1
of	1
the	1
people!”	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
made	1
him	1
rise,	1
and	1
said,	1
“So,	1
then,	1
it	1
is	1
true	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
history	1
of	1
me,	1
and	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
Moor	1
and	1
a	1
sage	1
who	1
wrote	1
it?”	1
“So	1
true	1
is	1
it,	1
señor,”	1
said	1
Samson,	1
“that	1
my	1
belief	1
is	1
there	1
are	1
more	1
than	1
twelve	1
thousand	1
volumes	1
of	1
the	1
said	1
history	1
in	1
print	1
this	1
very	1
day.	1
Only	1
ask	1
Portugal,	1
Barcelona,	1
and	1
Valencia,	1
where	1
they	1
have	1
been	1
printed,	1
and	1
moreover	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
report	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
being	1
printed	1
at	1
Antwerp,	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
persuaded	1
there	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
a	1
country	1
or	1
language	1
in	1
which	1
there	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
a	1
translation	1
of	1
it.”	1
“One	1
of	1
the	1
things,”	1
here	1
observed	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“that	1
ought	1
to	1
give	1
most	1
pleasure	1
to	1
a	1
virtuous	1
and	1
eminent	1
man	1
is	1
to	1
find	1
himself	1
in	1
his	1
lifetime	1
in	1
print	1
and	1
in	1
type,	1
familiar	1
in	1
people’s	1
mouths	1
with	1
a	1
good	1
name;	1
I	1
say	1
with	1
a	1
good	1
name,	1
for	1
if	1
it	1
be	1
the	1
opposite,	1
then	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
death	1
to	1
be	1
compared	1
to	1
it.”	1
“If	1
it	1
goes	1
by	1
good	1
name	1
and	1
fame,”	1
said	1
the	1
bachelor,	1
“your	1
worship	1
alone	1
bears	1
away	1
the	1
palm	1
from	1
all	1
the	1
knights-errant;	1
for	1
the	1
Moor	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
language,	1
and	1
the	1
Christian	1
in	1
his,	1
have	1
taken	1
care	1
to	1
set	1
before	1
us	1
your	1
gallantry,	1
your	1
high	1
courage	1
in	1
encountering	1
dangers,	1
your	1
fortitude	1
in	1
adversity,	1
your	1
patience	1
under	1
misfortunes	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
wounds,	1
the	1
purity	1
and	1
continence	1
of	1
the	1
platonic	1
loves	1
of	1
your	1
worship	1
and	1
my	1
lady	1
Doña	1
Dulcinea	1
del	1
Toboso—”	1
“I	1
never	1
heard	1
my	1
lady	1
Dulcinea	1
called	1
Doña,”	1
observed	1
Sancho	1
here;	1
“nothing	1
more	1
than	1
the	1
lady	1
Dulcinea	1
del	1
Toboso;	1
so	1
here	1
already	1
the	1
history	1
is	1
wrong.”	1
“That	1
is	1
not	1
an	1
objection	1
of	1
any	1
importance,”	1
replied	1
Carrasco.	1
“Certainly	1
not,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
“but	1
tell	1
me,	1
señor	1
bachelor,	1
what	1
deeds	1
of	1
mine	1
are	1
they	1
that	1
are	1
made	1
most	1
of	1
in	1
this	1
history?”	1
“On	1
that	1
point,”	1
replied	1
the	1
bachelor,	1
“opinions	1
differ,	1
as	1
tastes	1
do;	1
some	1
swear	1
by	1
the	1
adventure	1
of	1
the	1
windmills	1
that	1
your	1
worship	1
took	1
to	1
be	1
Briareuses	1
and	1
giants;	1
others	1
by	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
fulling	1
mills;	1
one	1
cries	1
up	1
the	1
description	1
of	1
the	1
two	1
armies	1
that	1
afterwards	1
took	1
the	1
appearance	1
of	1
two	1
droves	1
of	1
sheep;	1
another	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
dead	1
body	1
on	1
its	1
way	1
to	1
be	1
buried	1
at	1
Segovia;	1
a	1
third	1
says	1
the	1
liberation	1
of	1
the	1
galley	1
slaves	1
is	1
the	1
best	1
of	1
all,	1
and	1
a	1
fourth	1
that	1
nothing	1
comes	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
affair	1
with	1
the	1
Benedictine	1
giants,	1
and	1
the	1
battle	1
with	1
the	1
valiant	1
Biscayan.”	1
“Tell	1
me,	1
señor	1
bachelor,”	1
said	1
Sancho	1
at	1
this	1
point,	1
“does	1
the	1
adventure	1
with	1
the	1
Yanguesans	1
come	1
in,	1
when	1
our	1
good	1
Rocinante	1
went	1
hankering	1
after	1
dainties?”	1
“The	1
sage	1
has	1
left	1
nothing	1
in	1
the	1
ink-bottle,”	1
replied	1
Samson;	1
“he	1
tells	1
all	1
and	1
sets	1
down	1
everything,	1
even	1
to	1
the	1
capers	1
that	1
worthy	1
Sancho	1
cut	1
in	1
the	1
blanket.”	1
“I	1
cut	1
no	1
capers	1
in	1
the	1
blanket,”	1
returned	1
Sancho;	1
“in	1
the	1
air	1
I	1
did,	1
and	1
more	1
of	1
them	1
than	1
I	1
liked.”	1
“There	1
is	1
no	1
human	1
history	1
in	1
the	1
world,	1
I	1
suppose,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“that	1
has	1
not	1
its	1
ups	1
and	1
downs,	1
but	1
more	1
than	1
others	1
such	1
as	1
deal	1
with	1
chivalry,	1
for	1
they	1
can	1
never	1
be	1
entirely	1
made	1
up	1
of	1
prosperous	1
adventures.”	1
“For	1
all	1
that,”	1
replied	1
the	1
bachelor,	1
“there	1
are	1
those	1
who	1
have	1
read	1
the	1
history	1
who	1
say	1
they	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
glad	1
if	1
the	1
author	1
had	1
left	1
out	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
countless	1
cudgellings	1
that	1
were	1
inflicted	1
on	1
Señor	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
in	1
various	1
encounters.”	1
“That’s	1
where	1
the	1
truth	1
of	1
the	1
history	1
comes	1
in,”	1
said	1
Sancho.	1
“At	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
they	1
might	1
fairly	1
have	1
passed	1
them	1
over	1
in	1
silence,”	1
observed	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
“for	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
need	1
of	1
recording	1
events	1
which	1
do	1
not	1
change	1
or	1
affect	1
the	1
truth	1
of	1
a	1
history,	1
if	1
they	1
tend	1
to	1
bring	1
the	1
hero	1
of	1
it	1
into	1
contempt.	1
Æneas	1
was	1
not	1
in	1
truth	1
and	1
earnest	1
so	1
pious	1
as	1
Virgil	1
represents	1
him,	1
nor	1
Ulysses	1
so	1
wise	1
as	1
Homer	1
describes	1
him.”	1
“That	1
is	1
true,”	1
said	1
Samson;	1
“but	1
it	1
is	1
one	1
thing	1
to	1
write	1
as	1
a	1
poet,	1
another	1
to	1
write	1
as	1
a	1
historian;	1
the	1
poet	1
may	1
describe	1
or	1
sing	1
things,	1
not	1
as	1
they	1
were,	1
but	1
as	1
they	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
been;	1
but	1
the	1
historian	1
has	1
to	1
write	1
them	1
down,	1
not	1
as	1
they	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
been,	1
but	1
as	1
they	1
were,	1
without	1
adding	1
anything	1
to	1
the	1
truth	1
or	1
taking	1
anything	1
from	1
it.”	1
“Well	1
then,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“if	1
this	1
señor	1
Moor	1
goes	1
in	1
for	1
telling	1
the	1
truth,	1
no	1
doubt	1
among	1
my	1
master’s	1
drubbings	1
mine	1
are	1
to	1
be	1
found;	1
for	1
they	1
never	1
took	1
the	1
measure	1
of	1
his	1
worship’s	1
shoulders	1
without	1
doing	1
the	1
same	1
for	1
my	1
whole	1
body;	1
but	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
right	1
to	1
wonder	1
at	1
that,	1
for,	1
as	1
my	1
master	1
himself	1
says,	1
the	1
members	1
must	1
share	1
the	1
pain	1
of	1
the	1
head.”	1
“You	1
are	1
a	1
sly	1
dog,	1
Sancho,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
“i’	1
faith,	1
you	1
have	1
no	1
want	1
of	1
memory	1
when	1
you	1
choose	1
to	1
remember.”	1
“If	1
I	1
were	1
to	1
try	1
to	1
forget	1
the	1
thwacks	1
they	1
gave	1
me,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“my	1
weals	1
would	1
not	1
let	1
me,	1
for	1
they	1
are	1
still	1
fresh	1
on	1
my	1
ribs.”	1
“Hush,	1
Sancho,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“and	1
don’t	1
interrupt	1
the	1
bachelor,	1
whom	1
I	1
entreat	1
to	1
go	1
on	1
and	1
tell	1
all	1
that	1
is	1
said	1
about	1
me	1
in	1
this	1
history.”	1
“And	1
about	1
me,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“for	1
they	1
say,	1
too,	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
principal	1
presonages	1
in	1
it.”	1
“Personages,	1
not	1
presonages,	1
friend	1
Sancho,”	1
said	1
Samson.	1
“What!	1
Another	1
word-catcher!”	1
said	1
Sancho;	1
“if	1
that’s	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
way	1
we	1
shall	1
not	1
make	1
an	1
end	1
in	1
a	1
lifetime.”	1
“May	1
God	1
shorten	1
mine,	1
Sancho,”	1
returned	1
the	1
bachelor,	1
“if	1
you	1
are	1
not	1
the	1
second	1
person	1
in	1
the	1
history,	1
and	1
there	1
are	1
even	1
some	1
who	1
would	1
rather	1
hear	1
you	1
talk	1
than	1
the	1
cleverest	1
in	1
the	1
whole	1
book;	1
though	1
there	1
are	1
some,	1
too,	1
who	1
say	1
you	1
showed	1
yourself	1
over-credulous	1
in	1
believing	1
there	1
was	1
any	1
possibility	1
in	1
the	1
government	1
of	1
that	1
island	1
offered	1
you	1
by	1
Señor	1
Don	1
Quixote.”	1
“There	1
is	1
still	1
sunshine	1
on	1
the	1
wall,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
“and	1
when	1
Sancho	1
is	1
somewhat	1
more	1
advanced	1
in	1
life,	1
with	1
the	1
experience	1
that	1
years	1
bring,	1
he	1
will	1
be	1
fitter	1
and	1
better	1
qualified	1
for	1
being	1
a	1
governor	1
than	1
he	1
is	1
at	1
present.”	1
“By	1
God,	1
master,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“the	1
island	1
that	1
I	1
cannot	1
govern	1
with	1
the	1
years	1
I	1
have,	1
I’ll	1
not	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
govern	1
with	1
the	1
years	1
of	1
Methuselah;	1
the	1
difficulty	1
is	1
that	1
the	1
said	1
island	1
keeps	1
its	1
distance	1
somewhere,	1
I	1
know	1
not	1
where;	1
and	1
not	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
any	1
want	1
of	1
head	1
in	1
me	1
to	1
govern	1
it.”	1
“Leave	1
it	1
to	1
God,	1
Sancho,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“for	1
all	1
will	1
be	1
and	1
perhaps	1
better	1
than	1
you	1
think;	1
no	1
leaf	1
on	1
the	1
tree	1
stirs	1
but	1
by	1
God’s	1
will.”	1
“That	1
is	1
true,”	1
said	1
Samson;	1
“and	1
if	1
it	1
be	1
God’s	1
will,	1
there	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
any	1
want	1
of	1
a	1
thousand	1
islands,	1
much	1
less	1
one,	1
for	1
Sancho	1
to	1
govern.”	1
“I	1
have	1
seen	1
governors	1
in	1
these	1
parts,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“that	1
are	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
compared	1
to	1
my	1
shoe-sole;	1
and	1
for	1
all	1
that	1
they	1
are	1
called	1
‘your	1
lordship’	1
and	1
served	1
on	1
silver.”	1
“Those	1
are	1
not	1
governors	1
of	1
islands,”	1
observed	1
Samson,	1
“but	1
of	1
other	1
governments	1
of	1
an	1
easier	1
kind:	1
those	1
that	1
govern	1
islands	1
must	1
at	1
least	1
know	1
grammar.”	1
“I	1
could	1
manage	1
the	1
gram	1
well	1
enough,”	1
said	1
Sancho;	1
“but	1
for	1
the	1
mar	1
I	1
have	1
neither	1
leaning	1
nor	1
liking,	1
for	1
I	1
don’t	1
know	1
what	1
it	1
is;	1
but	1
leaving	1
this	1
matter	1
of	1
the	1
government	1
in	1
God’s	1
hands,	1
to	1
send	1
me	1
wherever	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
most	1
to	1
his	1
service,	1
I	1
may	1
tell	1
you,	1
señor	1
bachelor	1
Samson	1
Carrasco,	1
it	1
has	1
pleased	1
me	1
beyond	1
measure	1
that	1
the	1
author	1
of	1
this	1
history	1
should	1
have	1
spoken	1
of	1
me	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
way	1
that	1
what	1
is	1
said	1
of	1
me	1
gives	1
no	1
offence;	1
for,	1
on	1
the	1
faith	1
of	1
a	1
true	1
squire,	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
said	1
anything	1
about	1
me	1
that	1
was	1
at	1
all	1
unbecoming	1
an	1
old	1
Christian,	1
such	1
as	1
I	1
am,	1
the	1
deaf	1
would	1
have	1
heard	1
of	1
it.”	1
“That	1
would	1
be	1
working	1
miracles,”	1
said	1
Samson.	1
“Miracles	1
or	1
no	1
miracles,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“let	1
everyone	1
mind	1
how	1
he	1
speaks	1
or	1
writes	1
about	1
people,	1
and	1
not	1
set	1
down	1
at	1
random	1
the	1
first	1
thing	1
that	1
comes	1
into	1
his	1
head.”	1
“One	1
of	1
the	1
faults	1
they	1
find	1
with	1
this	1
history,”	1
said	1
the	1
bachelor,	1
“is	1
that	1
its	1
author	1
inserted	1
in	1
it	1
a	1
novel	1
called	1
‘The	1
Ill-advised	1
Curiosity;’	1
not	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
bad	1
or	1
ill-told,	1
but	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
out	1
of	1
place	1
and	1
has	1
nothing	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
the	1
history	1
of	1
his	1
worship	1
Señor	1
Don	1
Quixote.”	1
“I	1
will	1
bet	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
a	1
dog	1
has	1
mixed	1
the	1
cabbages	1
and	1
the	1
baskets,”	1
said	1
Sancho.	1
“Then,	1
I	1
say,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“the	1
author	1
of	1
my	1
history	1
was	1
no	1
sage,	1
but	1
some	1
ignorant	1
chatterer,	1
who,	1
in	1
a	1
haphazard	1
and	1
heedless	1
way,	1
set	1
about	1
writing	1
it,	1
let	1
it	1
turn	1
out	1
as	1
it	1
might,	1
just	1
as	1
Orbaneja,	1
the	1
painter	1
of	1
Úbeda,	1
used	1
to	1
do,	1
who,	1
when	1
they	1
asked	1
him	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
painting,	1
answered,	1
‘What	1
it	1
may	1
turn	1
out.’	1
Sometimes	1
he	1
would	1
paint	1
a	1
cock	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
fashion,	1
and	1
so	1
unlike,	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
write	1
alongside	1
of	1
it	1
in	1
Gothic	1
letters,	1
‘This	1
is	1
a	1
cock;	1
and	1
so	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
with	1
my	1
history,	1
which	1
will	1
require	1
a	1
commentary	1
to	1
make	1
it	1
intelligible.”	1
“No	1
fear	1
of	1
that,”	1
returned	1
Samson,	1
“for	1
it	1
is	1
so	1
plain	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
nothing	1
in	1
it	1
to	1
puzzle	1
over;	1
the	1
children	1
turn	1
its	1
leaves,	1
the	1
young	1
people	1
read	1
it,	1
the	1
grown	1
men	1
understand	1
it,	1
the	1
old	1
folk	1
praise	1
it;	1
in	1
a	1
word,	1
it	1
is	1
so	1
thumbed,	1
and	1
read,	1
and	1
got	1
by	1
heart	1
by	1
people	1
of	1
all	1
sorts,	1
that	1
the	1
instant	1
they	1
see	1
any	1
lean	1
hack,	1
they	1
say,	1
‘There	1
goes	1
Rocinante.’	1
And	1
those	1
that	1
are	1
most	1
given	1
to	1
reading	1
it	1
are	1
the	1
pages,	1
for	1
there	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
lord’s	1
ante-chamber	1
where	1
there	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
‘Don	1
Quixote’	1
to	1
be	1
found;	1
one	1
takes	1
it	1
up	1
if	1
another	1
lays	1
it	1
down;	1
this	1
one	1
pounces	1
upon	1
it,	1
and	1
that	1
begs	1
for	1
it.	1
In	1
short,	1
the	1
said	1
history	1
is	1
the	1
most	1
delightful	1
and	1
least	1
injurious	1
entertainment	1
that	1
has	1
been	1
hitherto	1
seen,	1
for	1
there	1
is	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
found	1
in	1
the	1
whole	1
of	1
it	1
even	1
the	1
semblance	1
of	1
an	1
immodest	1
word,	1
or	1
a	1
thought	1
that	1
is	1
other	1
than	1
Catholic.”	1
“To	1
write	1
in	1
any	1
other	1
way,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“would	1
not	1
be	1
to	1
write	1
truth,	1
but	1
falsehood,	1
and	1
historians	1
who	1
have	1
recourse	1
to	1
falsehood	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
burned,	1
like	1
those	1
who	1
coin	1
false	1
money;	1
and	1
I	1
know	1
not	1
what	1
could	1
have	1
led	1
the	1
author	1
to	1
have	1
recourse	1
to	1
novels	1
and	1
irrelevant	1
stories,	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
so	1
much	1
to	1
write	1
about	1
in	1
mine;	1
no	1
doubt	1
he	1
must	1
have	1
gone	1
by	1
the	1
proverb	1
‘with	1
straw	1
or	1
with	1
hay,	1
etc,’	1
for	1
by	1
merely	1
setting	1
forth	1
my	1
thoughts,	1
my	1
sighs,	1
my	1
tears,	1
my	1
lofty	1
purposes,	1
my	1
enterprises,	1
he	1
might	1
have	1
made	1
a	1
volume	1
as	1
large,	1
or	1
larger	1
than	1
all	1
the	1
works	1
of	1
El	1
Tostado	1
would	1
make	1
up.	1
In	1
fact,	1
the	1
conclusion	1
I	1
arrive	1
at,	1
señor	1
bachelor,	1
is,	1
that	1
to	1
write	1
histories,	1
or	1
books	1
of	1
any	1
kind,	1
there	1
is	1
need	1
of	1
great	1
judgment	1
and	1
a	1
ripe	1
understanding.	1
To	1
give	1
expression	1
to	1
humour,	1
and	1
write	1
in	1
a	1
strain	1
of	1
graceful	1
pleasantry,	1
is	1
the	1
gift	1
of	1
great	1
geniuses.	1
The	1
cleverest	1
character	1
in	1
comedy	1
is	1
the	1
clown,	1
for	1
he	1
who	1
would	1
make	1
people	1
take	1
him	1
for	1
a	1
fool,	1
must	1
not	1
be	1
one.	1
History	1
is	1
in	1
a	1
measure	1
a	1
sacred	1
thing,	1
for	1
it	1
should	1
be	1
true,	1
and	1
where	1
the	1
truth	1
is,	1
there	1
God	1
is;	1
but	1
notwithstanding	1
this,	1
there	1
are	1
some	1
who	1
write	1
and	1
fling	1
books	1
broadcast	1
on	1
the	1
world	1
as	1
if	1
they	1
were	1
fritters.”	1
“There	1
is	1
no	1
book	1
so	1
bad	1
but	1
it	1
has	1
something	1
good	1
in	1
it,”	1
said	1
the	1
bachelor.	1
“No	1
doubt	1
of	1
that,”	1
replied	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
“but	1
it	1
often	1
happens	1
that	1
those	1
who	1
have	1
acquired	1
and	1
attained	1
a	1
well-deserved	1
reputation	1
by	1
their	1
writings,	1
lose	1
it	1
entirely,	1
or	1
damage	1
it	1
in	1
some	1
degree,	1
when	1
they	1
give	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
press.”	1
“The	1
reason	1
of	1
that,”	1
said	1
Samson,	1
“is,	1
that	1
as	1
printed	1
works	1
are	1
examined	1
leisurely,	1
their	1
faults	1
are	1
easily	1
seen;	1
and	1
the	1
greater	1
the	1
fame	1
of	1
the	1
writer,	1
the	1
more	1
closely	1
are	1
they	1
scrutinised.	1
Men	1
famous	1
for	1
their	1
genius,	1
great	1
poets,	1
illustrious	1
historians,	1
are	1
always,	1
or	1
most	1
commonly,	1
envied	1
by	1
those	1
who	1
take	1
a	1
particular	1
delight	1
and	1
pleasure	1
in	1
criticising	1
the	1
writings	1
of	1
others,	1
without	1
having	1
produced	1
any	1
of	1
their	1
own.”	1
“That	1
is	1
no	1
wonder,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
“for	1
there	1
are	1
many	1
divines	1
who	1
are	1
no	1
good	1
for	1
the	1
pulpit,	1
but	1
excellent	1
in	1
detecting	1
the	1
defects	1
or	1
excesses	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
preach.”	1
“All	1
that	1
is	1
true,	1
Señor	1
Don	1
Quixote,”	1
said	1
Carrasco;	1
“but	1
I	1
wish	1
such	1
fault-finders	1
were	1
more	1
lenient	1
and	1
less	1
exacting,	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
pay	1
so	1
much	1
attention	1
to	1
the	1
spots	1
on	1
the	1
bright	1
sun	1
of	1
the	1
work	1
they	1
grumble	1
at;	1
for	1
if	1
_aliquando	1
bonus	1
dormitat	1
Homerus_,	1
they	1
should	1
remember	1
how	1
long	1
he	1
remained	1
awake	1
to	1
shed	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
his	1
work	1
with	1
as	1
little	1
shade	1
as	1
possible;	1
and	1
perhaps	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
that	1
what	1
they	1
find	1
fault	1
with	1
may	1
be	1
moles,	1
that	1
sometimes	1
heighten	1
the	1
beauty	1
of	1
the	1
face	1
that	1
bears	1
them;	1
and	1
so	1
I	1
say	1
very	1
great	1
is	1
the	1
risk	1
to	1
which	1
he	1
who	1
prints	1
a	1
book	1
exposes	1
himself,	1
for	1
of	1
all	1
impossibilities	1
the	1
greatest	1
is	1
to	1
write	1
one	1
that	1
will	1
satisfy	1
and	1
please	1
all	1
readers.”	1
“That	1
which	1
treats	1
of	1
me	1
must	1
have	1
pleased	1
few,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote.	1
“Quite	1
the	1
contrary,”	1
said	1
the	1
bachelor;	1
“for,	1
as	1
_stultorum	1
infinitum	1
est	1
numerus_,	1
innumerable	1
are	1
those	1
who	1
have	1
relished	1
the	1
said	1
history;	1
but	1
some	1
have	1
brought	1
a	1
charge	1
against	1
the	1
author’s	1
memory,	1
inasmuch	1
as	1
he	1
forgot	1
to	1
say	1
who	1
the	1
thief	1
was	1
who	1
stole	1
Sancho’s	1
Dapple;	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
stated	1
there,	1
but	1
only	1
to	1
be	1
inferred	1
from	1
what	1
is	1
set	1
down,	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
stolen,	1
and	1
a	1
little	1
farther	1
on	1
we	1
see	1
Sancho	1
mounted	1
on	1
the	1
same	1
ass,	1
without	1
any	1
reappearance	1
of	1
it.	1
They	1
say,	1
too,	1
that	1
he	1
forgot	1
to	1
state	1
what	1
Sancho	1
did	1
with	1
those	1
hundred	1
crowns	1
that	1
he	1
found	1
in	1
the	1
valise	1
in	1
the	1
Sierra	1
Morena,	1
as	1
he	1
never	1
alludes	1
to	1
them	1
again,	1
and	1
there	1
are	1
many	1
who	1
would	1
be	1
glad	1
to	1
know	1
what	1
he	1
did	1
with	1
them,	1
or	1
what	1
he	1
spent	1
them	1
on,	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
serious	1
omissions	1
of	1
the	1
work.”	1
“Señor	1
Samson,	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
in	1
a	1
humour	1
now	1
for	1
going	1
into	1
accounts	1
or	1
explanations,”	1
said	1
Sancho;	1
“for	1
there’s	1
a	1
sinking	1
of	1
the	1
stomach	1
come	1
over	1
me,	1
and	1
unless	1
I	1
doctor	1
it	1
with	1
a	1
couple	1
of	1
sups	1
of	1
the	1
old	1
stuff	1
it	1
will	1
put	1
me	1
on	1
the	1
thorn	1
of	1
Santa	1
Lucia.	1
I	1
have	1
it	1
at	1
home,	1
and	1
my	1
old	1
woman	1
is	1
waiting	1
for	1
me;	1
after	1
dinner	1
I’ll	1
come	1
back,	1
and	1
will	1
answer	1
you	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
world	1
every	1
question	1
you	1
may	1
choose	1
to	1
ask,	1
as	1
well	1
about	1
the	1
loss	1
of	1
the	1
ass	1
as	1
about	1
the	1
spending	1
of	1
the	1
hundred	1
crowns;”	1
and	1
without	1
another	1
word	1
or	1
waiting	1
for	1
a	1
reply	1
he	1
made	1
off	1
home.	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
begged	1
and	1
entreated	1
the	1
bachelor	1
to	1
stay	1
and	1
do	1
penance	1
with	1
him.	1
The	1
bachelor	1
accepted	1
the	1
invitation	1
and	1
remained,	1
a	1
couple	1
of	1
young	1
pigeons	1
were	1
added	1
to	1
the	1
ordinary	1
fare,	1
at	1
dinner	1
they	1
talked	1
chivalry,	1
Carrasco	1
fell	1
in	1
with	1
his	1
host’s	1
humour,	1
the	1
banquet	1
came	1
to	1
an	1
end,	1
they	1
took	1
their	1
afternoon	1
sleep,	1
Sancho	1
returned,	1
and	1
their	1
conversation	1
was	1
resumed.	1

Sancho	1
came	1
back	1
to	1
Don	1
Quixote’s	1
house,	1
and	1
returning	1
to	1
the	1
late	1
subject	1
of	1
conversation,	1
he	1
said,	1
“As	1
to	1
what	1
Señor	1
Samson	1
said,	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
like	1
to	1
know	1
by	1
whom,	1
or	1
how,	1
or	1
when	1
my	1
ass	1
was	1
stolen,	1
I	1
say	1
in	1
reply	1
that	1
the	1
same	1
night	1
we	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
Sierra	1
Morena,	1
flying	1
from	1
the	1
Holy	1
Brotherhood	1
after	1
that	1
unlucky	1
adventure	1
of	1
the	1
galley	1
slaves,	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
of	1
the	1
corpse	1
that	1
was	1
going	1
to	1
Segovia,	1
my	1
master	1
and	1
I	1
ensconced	1
ourselves	1
in	1
a	1
thicket,	1
and	1
there,	1
my	1
master	1
leaning	1
on	1
his	1
lance,	1
and	1
I	1
seated	1
on	1
my	1
Dapple,	1
battered	1
and	1
weary	1
with	1
the	1
late	1
frays	1
we	1
fell	1
asleep	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
on	1
four	1
feather	1
mattresses;	1
and	1
I	1
in	1
particular	1
slept	1
so	1
sound,	1
that,	1
whoever	1
he	1
was,	1
he	1
was	1
able	1
to	1
come	1
and	1
prop	1
me	1
up	1
on	1
four	1
stakes,	1
which	1
he	1
put	1
under	1
the	1
four	1
corners	1
of	1
the	1
pack-saddle	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
way	1
that	1
he	1
left	1
me	1
mounted	1
on	1
it,	1
and	1
took	1
away	1
Dapple	1
from	1
under	1
me	1
without	1
my	1
feeling	1
it.”	1

“That	1
is	1
an	1
easy	1
matter,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“and	1
it	1
is	1
no	1
new	1
occurrence,	1
for	1
the	1
same	1
thing	1
happened	1
to	1
Sacripante	1
at	1
the	1
siege	1
of	1
Albracca;	1
the	1
famous	1
thief,	1
Brunello,	1
by	1
the	1
same	1
contrivance,	1
took	1
his	1
horse	1
from	1
between	1
his	1
legs.”	1
“Day	1
came,”	1
continued	1
Sancho,	1
“and	1
the	1
moment	1
I	1
stirred	1
the	1
stakes	1
gave	1
way	1
and	1
I	1
fell	1
to	1
the	1
ground	1
with	1
a	1
mighty	1
come	1
down;	1
I	1
looked	1
about	1
for	1
the	1
ass,	1
but	1
could	1
not	1
see	1
him;	1
the	1
tears	1
rushed	1
to	1
my	1
eyes	1
and	1
I	1
raised	1
such	1
a	1
lamentation	1
that,	1
if	1
the	1
author	1
of	1
our	1
history	1
has	1
not	1
put	1
it	1
in,	1
he	1
may	1
depend	1
upon	1
it	1
he	1
has	1
left	1
out	1
a	1
good	1
thing.	1
Some	1
days	1
after,	1
I	1
know	1
not	1
how	1
many,	1
travelling	1
with	1
her	1
ladyship	1
the	1
Princess	1
Micomicona,	1
I	1
saw	1
my	1
ass,	1
and	1
mounted	1
upon	1
him,	1
in	1
the	1
dress	1
of	1
a	1
gipsy,	1
was	1
that	1
Gines	1
de	1
Pasamonte,	1
the	1
great	1
rogue	1
and	1
rascal	1
that	1
my	1
master	1
and	1
I	1
freed	1
from	1
the	1
chain.”	1
“That	1
is	1
not	1
where	1
the	1
mistake	1
is,”	1
replied	1
Samson;	1
“it	1
is,	1
that	1
before	1
the	1
ass	1
has	1
turned	1
up,	1
the	1
author	1
speaks	1
of	1
Sancho	1
as	1
being	1
mounted	1
on	1
it.”	1
“I	1
don’t	1
know	1
what	1
to	1
say	1
to	1
that,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“unless	1
that	1
the	1
historian	1
made	1
a	1
mistake,	1
or	1
perhaps	1
it	1
might	1
be	1
a	1
blunder	1
of	1
the	1
printer’s.”	1
“No	1
doubt	1
that’s	1
it,”	1
said	1
Samson;	1
“but	1
what	1
became	1
of	1
the	1
hundred	1
crowns?	1
Did	1
they	1
vanish?”	1
To	1
which	1
Sancho	1
answered,	1
“I	1
spent	1
them	1
for	1
my	1
own	1
good,	1
and	1
my	1
wife’s,	1
and	1
my	1
children’s,	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
they	1
that	1
have	1
made	1
my	1
wife	1
bear	1
so	1
patiently	1
all	1
my	1
wanderings	1
on	1
highways	1
and	1
byways,	1
in	1
the	1
service	1
of	1
my	1
master,	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
for	1
if	1
after	1
all	1
this	1
time	1
I	1
had	1
come	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
without	1
a	1
rap	1
and	1
without	1
the	1
ass,	1
it	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
a	1
poor	1
look-out	1
for	1
me;	1
and	1
if	1
anyone	1
wants	1
to	1
know	1
anything	1
more	1
about	1
me,	1
here	1
I	1
am,	1
ready	1
to	1
answer	1
the	1
king	1
himself	1
in	1
person;	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
no	1
affair	1
of	1
anyone’s	1
whether	1
I	1
took	1
or	1
did	1
not	1
take,	1
whether	1
I	1
spent	1
or	1
did	1
not	1
spend;	1
for	1
the	1
whacks	1
that	1
were	1
given	1
me	1
in	1
these	1
journeys	1
were	1
to	1
be	1
paid	1
for	1
in	1
money,	1
even	1
if	1
they	1
were	1
valued	1
at	1
no	1
more	1
than	1
four	1
maravedis	1
apiece,	1
another	1
hundred	1
crowns	1
would	1
not	1
pay	1
me	1
for	1
half	1
of	1
them.	1
Let	1
each	1
look	1
to	1
himself	1
and	1
not	1
try	1
to	1
make	1
out	1
white	1
black,	1
and	1
black	1
white;	1
for	1
each	1
of	1
us	1
is	1
as	1
God	1
made	1
him,	1
aye,	1
and	1
often	1
worse.”	1
“I	1
will	1
take	1
care,”	1
said	1
Carrasco,	1
“to	1
impress	1
upon	1
the	1
author	1
of	1
the	1
history	1
that,	1
if	1
he	1
prints	1
it	1
again,	1
he	1
must	1
not	1
forget	1
what	1
worthy	1
Sancho	1
has	1
said,	1
for	1
it	1
will	1
raise	1
it	1
a	1
good	1
span	1
higher.”	1
“Is	1
there	1
anything	1
else	1
to	1
correct	1
in	1
the	1
history,	1
señor	1
bachelor?”	1
asked	1
Don	1
Quixote.	1
“No	1
doubt	1
there	1
is,”	1
replied	1
he;	1
“but	1
not	1
anything	1
that	1
will	1
be	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
importance	1
as	1
those	1
I	1
have	1
mentioned.”	1
“Does	1
the	1
author	1
promise	1
a	1
second	1
part	1
at	1
all?”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote.	1
“He	1
does	1
promise	1
one,”	1
replied	1
Samson;	1
“but	1
he	1
says	1
he	1
has	1
not	1
found	1
it,	1
nor	1
does	1
he	1
know	1
who	1
has	1
got	1
it;	1
and	1
we	1
cannot	1
say	1
whether	1
it	1
will	1
appear	1
or	1
not;	1
and	1
so,	1
on	1
that	1
head,	1
as	1
some	1
say	1
that	1
no	1
second	1
part	1
has	1
ever	1
been	1
good,	1
and	1
others	1
that	1
enough	1
has	1
been	1
already	1
written	1
about	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
it	1
is	1
thought	1
there	1
will	1
be	1
no	1
second	1
part;	1
though	1
some,	1
who	1
are	1
jovial	1
rather	1
than	1
saturnine,	1
say,	1
‘Let	1
us	1
have	1
more	1
Quixotades,	1
let	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
charge	1
and	1
Sancho	1
chatter,	1
and	1
no	1
matter	1
what	1
it	1
may	1
turn	1
out,	1
we	1
shall	1
be	1
satisfied	1
with	1
that.’”	1
“And	1
what	1
does	1
the	1
author	1
mean	1
to	1
do?”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote.	1
“What?”	1
replied	1
Samson;	1
“why,	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
has	1
found	1
the	1
history	1
which	1
he	1
is	1
now	1
searching	1
for	1
with	1
extraordinary	1
diligence,	1
he	1
will	1
at	1
once	1
give	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
press,	1
moved	1
more	1
by	1
the	1
profit	1
that	1
may	1
accrue	1
to	1
him	1
from	1
doing	1
so	1
than	1
by	1
any	1
thought	1
of	1
praise.”	1
Whereat	1
Sancho	1
observed,	1
“The	1
author	1
looks	1
for	1
money	1
and	1
profit,	1
does	1
he?	1
It	1
will	1
be	1
a	1
wonder	1
if	1
he	1
succeeds,	1
for	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
only	1
hurry,	1
hurry,	1
with	1
him,	1
like	1
the	1
tailor	1
on	1
Easter	1
Eve;	1
and	1
works	1
done	1
in	1
a	1
hurry	1
are	1
never	1
finished	1
as	1
perfectly	1
as	1
they	1
ought	1
to	1
be.	1
Let	1
master	1
Moor,	1
or	1
whatever	1
he	1
is,	1
pay	1
attention	1
to	1
what	1
he	1
is	1
doing,	1
and	1
I	1
and	1
my	1
master	1
will	1
give	1
him	1
as	1
much	1
grouting	1
ready	1
to	1
his	1
hand,	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
adventures	1
and	1
accidents	1
of	1
all	1
sorts,	1
as	1
would	1
make	1
up	1
not	1
only	1
one	1
second	1
part,	1
but	1
a	1
hundred.	1
The	1
good	1
man	1
fancies,	1
no	1
doubt,	1
that	1
we	1
are	1
fast	1
asleep	1
in	1
the	1
straw	1
here,	1
but	1
let	1
him	1
hold	1
up	1
our	1
feet	1
to	1
be	1
shod	1
and	1
he	1
will	1
see	1
which	1
foot	1
it	1
is	1
we	1
go	1
lame	1
on.	1
All	1
I	1
say	1
is,	1
that	1
if	1
my	1
master	1
would	1
take	1
my	1
advice,	1
we	1
would	1
be	1
now	1
afield,	1
redressing	1
outrages	1
and	1
righting	1
wrongs,	1
as	1
is	1
the	1
use	1
and	1
custom	1
of	1
good	1
knights-errant.”	1
Sancho	1
had	1
hardly	1
uttered	1
these	1
words	1
when	1
the	1
neighing	1
of	1
Rocinante	1
fell	1
upon	1
their	1
ears,	1
which	1
neighing	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
accepted	1
as	1
a	1
happy	1
omen,	1
and	1
he	1
resolved	1
to	1
make	1
another	1
sally	1
in	1
three	1
or	1
four	1
days	1
from	1
that	1
time.	1
Announcing	1
his	1
intention	1
to	1
the	1
bachelor,	1
he	1
asked	1
his	1
advice	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
quarter	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
ought	1
to	1
commence	1
his	1
expedition,	1
and	1
the	1
bachelor	1
replied	1
that	1
in	1
his	1
opinion	1
he	1
ought	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
Aragon,	1
and	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
Saragossa,	1
where	1
there	1
were	1
to	1
be	1
certain	1
solemn	1
joustings	1
at	1
the	1
festival	1
of	1
St.	1
George,	1
at	1
which	1
he	1
might	1
win	1
renown	1
above	1
all	1
the	1
knights	1
of	1
Aragon,	1
which	1
would	1
be	1
winning	1
it	1
above	1
all	1
the	1
knights	1
of	1
the	1
world.	1
He	1
commended	1
his	1
very	1
praiseworthy	1
and	1
gallant	1
resolution,	1
but	1
admonished	1
him	1
to	1
proceed	1
with	1
greater	1
caution	1
in	1
encountering	1
dangers,	1
because	1
his	1
life	1
did	1
not	1
belong	1
to	1
him,	1
but	1
to	1
all	1
those	1
who	1
had	1
need	1
of	1
him	1
to	1
protect	1
and	1
aid	1
them	1
in	1
their	1
misfortunes.	1
“There’s	1
where	1
it	1
is,	1
what	1
I	1
abominate,	1
Señor	1
Samson,”	1
said	1
Sancho	1
here;	1
“my	1
master	1
will	1
attack	1
a	1
hundred	1
armed	1
men	1
as	1
a	1
greedy	1
boy	1
would	1
half	1
a	1
dozen	1
melons.	1
Body	1
of	1
the	1
world,	1
señor	1
bachelor!	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
time	1
to	1
attack	1
and	1
a	1
time	1
to	1
retreat,	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
always	1
‘Santiago,	1
and	1
close	1
Spain!’	1
Moreover,	1
I	1
have	1
heard	1
it	1
said	1
(and	1
I	1
think	1
by	1
my	1
master	1
himself,	1
if	1
I	1
remember	1
rightly)	1
that	1
the	1
mean	1
of	1
valour	1
lies	1
between	1
the	1
extremes	1
of	1
cowardice	1
and	1
rashness;	1
and	1
if	1
that	1
be	1
so,	1
I	1
don’t	1
want	1
him	1
to	1
fly	1
without	1
having	1
good	1
reason,	1
or	1
to	1
attack	1
when	1
the	1
odds	1
make	1
it	1
better	1
not.	1
But,	1
above	1
all	1
things,	1
I	1
warn	1
my	1
master	1
that	1
if	1
he	1
is	1
to	1
take	1
me	1
with	1
him	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
on	1
the	1
condition	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
to	1
do	1
all	1
the	1
fighting,	1
and	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
called	1
upon	1
to	1
do	1
anything	1
except	1
what	1
concerns	1
keeping	1
him	1
clean	1
and	1
comfortable;	1
in	1
this	1
I	1
will	1
dance	1
attendance	1
on	1
him	1
readily;	1
but	1
to	1
expect	1
me	1
to	1
draw	1
sword,	1
even	1
against	1
rascally	1
churls	1
of	1
the	1
hatchet	1
and	1
hood,	1
is	1
idle.	1
I	1
don’t	1
set	1
up	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
fighting	1
man,	1
Señor	1
Samson,	1
but	1
only	1
the	1
best	1
and	1
most	1
loyal	1
squire	1
that	1
ever	1
served	1
knight-errant;	1
and	1
if	1
my	1
master	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
in	1
consideration	1
of	1
my	1
many	1
faithful	1
services,	1
is	1
pleased	1
to	1
give	1
me	1
some	1
island	1
of	1
the	1
many	1
his	1
worship	1
says	1
one	1
may	1
stumble	1
on	1
in	1
these	1
parts,	1
I	1
will	1
take	1
it	1
as	1
a	1
great	1
favour;	1
and	1
if	1
he	1
does	1
not	1
give	1
it	1
to	1
me,	1
I	1
was	1
born	1
like	1
everyone	1
else,	1
and	1
a	1
man	1
must	1
not	1
live	1
in	1
dependence	1
on	1
anyone	1
except	1
God;	1
and	1
what	1
is	1
more,	1
my	1
bread	1
will	1
taste	1
as	1
well,	1
and	1
perhaps	1
even	1
better,	1
without	1
a	1
government	1
than	1
if	1
I	1
were	1
a	1
governor;	1
and	1
how	1
do	1
I	1
know	1
but	1
that	1
in	1
these	1
governments	1
the	1
devil	1
may	1
have	1
prepared	1
some	1
trip	1
for	1
me,	1
to	1
make	1
me	1
lose	1
my	1
footing	1
and	1
fall	1
and	1
knock	1
my	1
grinders	1
out?	1
Sancho	1
I	1
was	1
born	1
and	1
Sancho	1
I	1
mean	1
to	1
die.	1
But	1
for	1
all	1
that,	1
if	1
heaven	1
were	1
to	1
make	1
me	1
a	1
fair	1
offer	1
of	1
an	1
island	1
or	1
something	1
else	1
of	1
the	1
kind,	1
without	1
much	1
trouble	1
and	1
without	1
much	1
risk,	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
such	1
a	1
fool	1
as	1
to	1
refuse	1
it;	1
for	1
they	1
say,	1
too,	1
‘when	1
they	1
offer	1
thee	1
a	1
heifer,	1
run	1
with	1
a	1
halter;	1
and	1
‘when	1
good	1
luck	1
comes	1
to	1
thee,	1
take	1
it	1
in.’”	1
“Brother	1
Sancho,”	1
said	1
Carrasco,	1
“you	1
have	1
spoken	1
like	1
a	1
professor;	1
but,	1
for	1
all	1
that,	1
put	1
your	1
trust	1
in	1
God	1
and	1
in	1
Señor	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
for	1
he	1
will	1
give	1
you	1
a	1
kingdom,	1
not	1
to	1
say	1
an	1
island.”	1
“It	1
is	1
all	1
the	1
same,	1
be	1
it	1
more	1
or	1
be	1
it	1
less,”	1
replied	1
Sancho;	1
“though	1
I	1
can	1
tell	1
Señor	1
Carrasco	1
that	1
my	1
master	1
would	1
not	1
throw	1
the	1
kingdom	1
he	1
might	1
give	1
me	1
into	1
a	1
sack	1
all	1
in	1
holes;	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
felt	1
my	1
own	1
pulse	1
and	1
I	1
find	1
myself	1
sound	1
enough	1
to	1
rule	1
kingdoms	1
and	1
govern	1
islands;	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
before	1
now	1
told	1
my	1
master	1
as	1
much.”	1
“Take	1
care,	1
Sancho,”	1
said	1
Samson;	1
“honours	1
change	1
manners,	1
and	1
perhaps	1
when	1
you	1
find	1
yourself	1
a	1
governor	1
you	1
won’t	1
know	1
the	1
mother	1
that	1
bore	1
you.”	1
“That	1
may	1
hold	1
good	1
of	1
those	1
that	1
are	1
born	1
in	1
the	1
ditches,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“not	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
have	1
the	1
fat	1
of	1
an	1
old	1
Christian	1
four	1
fingers	1
deep	1
on	1
their	1
souls,	1
as	1
I	1
have.	1
Nay,	1
only	1
look	1
at	1
my	1
disposition,	1
is	1
that	1
likely	1
to	1
show	1
ingratitude	1
to	1
anyone?”	1
“God	1
grant	1
it,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
“we	1
shall	1
see	1
when	1
the	1
government	1
comes;	1
and	1
I	1
seem	1
to	1
see	1
it	1
already.”	1
He	1
then	1
begged	1
the	1
bachelor,	1
if	1
he	1
were	1
a	1
poet,	1
to	1
do	1
him	1
the	1
favour	1
of	1
composing	1
some	1
verses	1
for	1
him	1
conveying	1
the	1
farewell	1
he	1
meant	1
to	1
take	1
of	1
his	1
lady	1
Dulcinea	1
del	1
Toboso,	1
and	1
to	1
see	1
that	1
a	1
letter	1
of	1
her	1
name	1
was	1
placed	1
at	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
each	1
line,	1
so	1
that,	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
verses,	1
“Dulcinea	1
del	1
Toboso”	1
might	1
be	1
read	1
by	1
putting	1
together	1
the	1
first	1
letters.	1
The	1
bachelor	1
replied	1
that	1
although	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
famous	1
poets	1
of	1
Spain,	1
who	1
were,	1
they	1
said,	1
only	1
three	1
and	1
a	1
half,	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
fail	1
to	1
compose	1
the	1
required	1
verses;	1
though	1
he	1
saw	1
a	1
great	1
difficulty	1
in	1
the	1
task,	1
as	1
the	1
letters	1
which	1
made	1
up	1
the	1
name	1
were	1
seventeen;	1
so,	1
if	1
he	1
made	1
four	1
ballad	1
stanzas	1
of	1
four	1
lines	1
each,	1
there	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
letter	1
over,	1
and	1
if	1
he	1
made	1
them	1
of	1
five,	1
what	1
they	1
called	1
decimas	1
or	1
redondillas,	1
there	1
were	1
three	1
letters	1
short;	1
nevertheless	1
he	1
would	1
try	1
to	1
drop	1
a	1
letter	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
he	1
could,	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
name	1
“Dulcinea	1
del	1
Toboso”	1
might	1
be	1
got	1
into	1
four	1
ballad	1
stanzas.	1
“It	1
must	1
be,	1
by	1
some	1
means	1
or	1
other,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“for	1
unless	1
the	1
name	1
stands	1
there	1
plain	1
and	1
manifest,	1
no	1
woman	1
would	1
believe	1
the	1
verses	1
were	1
made	1
for	1
her.”	1
They	1
agreed	1
upon	1
this,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
departure	1
should	1
take	1
place	1
in	1
three	1
days	1
from	1
that	1
time.	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
charged	1
the	1
bachelor	1
to	1
keep	1
it	1
a	1
secret,	1
especially	1
from	1
the	1
curate	1
and	1
Master	1
Nicholas,	1
and	1
from	1
his	1
niece	1
and	1
the	1
housekeeper,	1
lest	1
they	1
should	1
prevent	1
the	1
execution	1
of	1
his	1
praiseworthy	1
and	1
valiant	1
purpose.	1
Carrasco	1
promised	1
all,	1
and	1
then	1
took	1
his	1
leave,	1
charging	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
to	1
inform	1
him	1
of	1
his	1
good	1
or	1
evil	1
fortunes	1
whenever	1
he	1
had	1
an	1
opportunity;	1
and	1
thus	1
they	1
bade	1
each	1
other	1
farewell,	1
and	1
Sancho	1
went	1
away	1
to	1
make	1
the	1
necessary	1
preparations	1
for	1
their	1
expedition.	1

The	1
translator	1
of	1
this	1
history,	1
when	1
he	1
comes	1
to	1
write	1
this	1
fifth	1
chapter,	1
says	1
that	1
he	1
considers	1
it	1
apocryphal,	1
because	1
in	1
it	1
Sancho	1
Panza	1
speaks	1
in	1
a	1
style	1
unlike	1
that	1
which	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
expected	1
from	1
his	1
limited	1
intelligence,	1
and	1
says	1
things	1
so	1
subtle	1
that	1
he	1
does	1
not	1
think	1
it	1
possible	1
he	1
could	1
have	1
conceived	1
them;	1
however,	1
desirous	1
of	1
doing	1
what	1
his	1
task	1
imposed	1
upon	1
him,	1
he	1
was	1
unwilling	1
to	1
leave	1
it	1
untranslated,	1
and	1
therefore	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
to	1
say:	1
Sancho	1
came	1
home	1
in	1
such	1
glee	1
and	1
spirits	1
that	1
his	1
wife	1
noticed	1
his	1
happiness	1
a	1
bowshot	1
off,	1
so	1
much	1
so	1
that	1
it	1
made	1
her	1
ask	1
him,	1
“What	1
have	1
you	1
got,	1
Sancho	1
friend,	1
that	1
you	1
are	1
so	1
glad?”	1
To	1
which	1
he	1
replied,	1
“Wife,	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
God’s	1
will,	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
very	1
glad	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
so	1
well	1
pleased	1
as	1
I	1
show	1
myself.”	1
“I	1
don’t	1
understand	1
you,	1
husband,”	1
said	1
she,	1
“and	1
I	1
don’t	1
know	1
what	1
you	1
mean	1
by	1
saying	1
you	1
would	1
be	1
glad,	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
God’s	1
will,	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
well	1
pleased;	1
for,	1
fool	1
as	1
I	1
am,	1
I	1
don’t	1
know	1
how	1
one	1
can	1
find	1
pleasure	1
in	1
not	1
having	1
it.”	1
“Hark	1
ye,	1
Teresa,”	1
replied	1
Sancho,	1
“I	1
am	1
glad	1
because	1
I	1
have	1
made	1
up	1
my	1
mind	1
to	1
go	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
service	1
of	1
my	1
master	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
who	1
means	1
to	1
go	1
out	1
a	1
third	1
time	1
to	1
seek	1
for	1
adventures;	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
going	1
with	1
him	1
again,	1
for	1
my	1
necessities	1
will	1
have	1
it	1
so,	1
and	1
also	1
the	1
hope	1
that	1
cheers	1
me	1
with	1
the	1
thought	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
find	1
another	1
hundred	1
crowns	1
like	1
those	1
we	1
have	1
spent;	1
though	1
it	1
makes	1
me	1
sad	1
to	1
have	1
to	1
leave	1
thee	1
and	1
the	1
children;	1
and	1
if	1
God	1
would	1
be	1
pleased	1
to	1
let	1
me	1
have	1
my	1
daily	1
bread,	1
dry-shod	1
and	1
at	1
home,	1
without	1
taking	1
me	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
byways	1
and	1
cross-roads—and	1
he	1
could	1
do	1
it	1
at	1
small	1
cost	1
by	1
merely	1
willing	1
it—it	1
is	1
clear	1
my	1
happiness	1
would	1
be	1
more	1
solid	1
and	1
lasting,	1
for	1
the	1
happiness	1
I	1
have	1
is	1
mingled	1
with	1
sorrow	1
at	1
leaving	1
thee;	1
so	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
right	1
in	1
saying	1
I	1
would	1
be	1
glad,	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
God’s	1
will,	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
well	1
pleased.”	1
“Look	1
here,	1
Sancho,”	1
said	1
Teresa;	1
“ever	1
since	1
you	1
joined	1
on	1
to	1
a	1
knight-errant	1
you	1
talk	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
roundabout	1
way	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
understanding	1
you.”	1
“It	1
is	1
enough	1
that	1
God	1
understands	1
me,	1
wife,”	1
replied	1
Sancho;	1
“for	1
he	1
is	1
the	1
understander	1
of	1
all	1
things;	1
that	1
will	1
do;	1
but	1
mind,	1
sister,	1
you	1
must	1
look	1
to	1
Dapple	1
carefully	1
for	1
the	1
next	1
three	1
days,	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
be	1
fit	1
to	1
take	1
arms;	1
double	1
his	1
feed,	1
and	1
see	1
to	1
the	1
pack-saddle	1
and	1
other	1
harness,	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
to	1
a	1
wedding	1
we	1
are	1
bound,	1
but	1
to	1
go	1
round	1
the	1
world,	1
and	1
play	1
at	1
give	1
and	1
take	1
with	1
giants	1
and	1
dragons	1
and	1
monsters,	1
and	1
hear	1
hissings	1
and	1
roarings	1
and	1
bellowings	1
and	1
howlings;	1
and	1
even	1
all	1
this	1
would	1
be	1
lavender,	1
if	1
we	1
had	1
not	1
to	1
reckon	1
with	1
Yanguesans	1
and	1
enchanted	1
Moors.”	1
“I	1
know	1
well	1
enough,	1
husband,”	1
said	1
Teresa,	1
“that	1
squires-errant	1
don’t	1
eat	1
their	1
bread	1
for	1
nothing,	1
and	1
so	1
I	1
will	1
be	1
always	1
praying	1
to	1
our	1
Lord	1
to	1
deliver	1
you	1
speedily	1
from	1
all	1
that	1
hard	1
fortune.”	1
“I	1
can	1
tell	1
you,	1
wife,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“if	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
expect	1
to	1
see	1
myself	1
governor	1
of	1
an	1
island	1
before	1
long,	1
I	1
would	1
drop	1
down	1
dead	1
on	1
the	1
spot.”	1
“Nay,	1
then,	1
husband,”	1
said	1
Teresa;	1
“let	1
the	1
hen	1
live,	1
though	1
it	1
be	1
with	1
her	1
pip,	1
live,	1
and	1
let	1
the	1
devil	1
take	1
all	1
the	1
governments	1
in	1
the	1
world;	1
you	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
your	1
mother’s	1
womb	1
without	1
a	1
government,	1
you	1
have	1
lived	1
until	1
now	1
without	1
a	1
government,	1
and	1
when	1
it	1
is	1
God’s	1
will	1
you	1
will	1
go,	1
or	1
be	1
carried,	1
to	1
your	1
grave	1
without	1
a	1
government.	1
How	1
many	1
there	1
are	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
who	1
live	1
without	1
a	1
government,	1
and	1
continue	1
to	1
live	1
all	1
the	1
same,	1
and	1
are	1
reckoned	1
in	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
the	1
people.	1
The	1
best	1
sauce	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
is	1
hunger,	1
and	1
as	1
the	1
poor	1
are	1
never	1
without	1
that,	1
they	1
always	1
eat	1
with	1
a	1
relish.	1
But	1
mind,	1
Sancho,	1
if	1
by	1
good	1
luck	1
you	1
should	1
find	1
yourself	1
with	1
some	1
government,	1
don’t	1
forget	1
me	1
and	1
your	1
children.	1
Remember	1
that	1
Sanchico	1
is	1
now	1
full	1
fifteen,	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
right	1
he	1
should	1
go	1
to	1
school,	1
if	1
his	1
uncle	1
the	1
abbot	1
has	1
a	1
mind	1
to	1
have	1
him	1
trained	1
for	1
the	1
Church.	1
Consider,	1
too,	1
that	1
your	1
daughter	1
Mari-Sancha	1
will	1
not	1
die	1
of	1
grief	1
if	1
we	1
marry	1
her;	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
my	1
suspicions	1
that	1
she	1
is	1
as	1
eager	1
to	1
get	1
a	1
husband	1
as	1
you	1
to	1
get	1
a	1
government;	1
and,	1
after	1
all,	1
a	1
daughter	1
looks	1
better	1
ill	1
married	1
than	1
well	1
whored.”	1
“By	1
my	1
faith,”	1
replied	1
Sancho,	1
“if	1
God	1
brings	1
me	1
to	1
get	1
any	1
sort	1
of	1
a	1
government,	1
I	1
intend,	1
wife,	1
to	1
make	1
such	1
a	1
high	1
match	1
for	1
Mari-Sancha	1
that	1
there	1
will	1
be	1
no	1
approaching	1
her	1
without	1
calling	1
her	1
‘my	1
lady.”	1
“Nay,	1
Sancho,”	1
returned	1
Teresa;	1
“marry	1
her	1
to	1
her	1
equal,	1
that	1
is	1
the	1
safest	1
plan;	1
for	1
if	1
you	1
put	1
her	1
out	1
of	1
wooden	1
clogs	1
into	1
high-heeled	1
shoes,	1
out	1
of	1
her	1
grey	1
flannel	1
petticoat	1
into	1
hoops	1
and	1
silk	1
gowns,	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
plain	1
‘Marica’	1
and	1
‘thou,’	1
into	1
‘Doña	1
So-and-so’	1
and	1
‘my	1
lady,’	1
the	1
girl	1
won’t	1
know	1
where	1
she	1
is,	1
and	1
at	1
every	1
turn	1
she	1
will	1
fall	1
into	1
a	1
thousand	1
blunders	1
that	1
will	1
show	1
the	1
thread	1
of	1
her	1
coarse	1
homespun	1
stuff.”	1
“Tut,	1
you	1
fool,”	1
said	1
Sancho;	1
“it	1
will	1
be	1
only	1
to	1
practise	1
it	1
for	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
years;	1
and	1
then	1
dignity	1
and	1
decorum	1
will	1
fit	1
her	1
as	1
easily	1
as	1
a	1
glove;	1
and	1
if	1
not,	1
what	1
matter?	1
Let	1
her	1
be	1
‘my	1
lady,’	1
and	1
never	1
mind	1
what	1
happens.”	1
“Keep	1
to	1
your	1
own	1
station,	1
Sancho,”	1
replied	1
Teresa;	1
“don’t	1
try	1
to	1
raise	1
yourself	1
higher,	1
and	1
bear	1
in	1
mind	1
the	1
proverb	1
that	1
says,	1
‘wipe	1
the	1
nose	1
of	1
your	1
neigbbour’s	1
son,	1
and	1
take	1
him	1
into	1
your	1
house.’	1
A	1
fine	1
thing	1
it	1
would	1
be,	1
indeed,	1
to	1
marry	1
our	1
Maria	1
to	1
some	1
great	1
count	1
or	1
grand	1
gentleman,	1
who,	1
when	1
the	1
humour	1
took	1
him,	1
would	1
abuse	1
her	1
and	1
call	1
her	1
clown-bred	1
and	1
clodhopper’s	1
daughter	1
and	1
spinning	1
wench.	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
been	1
bringing	1
up	1
my	1
daughter	1
for	1
that	1
all	1
this	1
time,	1
I	1
can	1
tell	1
you,	1
husband.	1
Do	1
you	1
bring	1
home	1
money,	1
Sancho,	1
and	1
leave	1
marrying	1
her	1
to	1
my	1
care;	1
there	1
is	1
Lope	1
Tocho,	1
Juan	1
Tocho’s	1
son,	1
a	1
stout,	1
sturdy	1
young	1
fellow	1
that	1
we	1
know,	1
and	1
I	1
can	1
see	1
he	1
does	1
not	1
look	1
sour	1
at	1
the	1
girl;	1
and	1
with	1
him,	1
one	1
of	1
our	1
own	1
sort,	1
she	1
will	1
be	1
well	1
married,	1
and	1
we	1
shall	1
have	1
her	1
always	1
under	1
our	1
eyes,	1
and	1
be	1
all	1
one	1
family,	1
parents	1
and	1
children,	1
grandchildren	1
and	1
sons-in-law,	1
and	1
the	1
peace	1
and	1
blessing	1
of	1
God	1
will	1
dwell	1
among	1
us;	1
so	1
don’t	1
you	1
go	1
marrying	1
her	1
in	1
those	1
courts	1
and	1
grand	1
palaces	1
where	1
they	1
won’t	1
know	1
what	1
to	1
make	1
of	1
her,	1
or	1
she	1
what	1
to	1
make	1
of	1
herself.”	1
“Why,	1
you	1
idiot	1
and	1
wife	1
for	1
Barabbas,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“what	1
do	1
you	1
mean	1
by	1
trying,	1
without	1
why	1
or	1
wherefore,	1
to	1
keep	1
me	1
from	1
marrying	1
my	1
daughter	1
to	1
one	1
who	1
will	1
give	1
me	1
grandchildren	1
that	1
will	1
be	1
called	1
‘your	1
lordship’?	1
Look	1
ye,	1
Teresa,	1
I	1
have	1
always	1
heard	1
my	1
elders	1
say	1
that	1
he	1
who	1
does	1
not	1
know	1
how	1
to	1
take	1
advantage	1
of	1
luck	1
when	1
it	1
comes	1
to	1
him,	1
has	1
no	1
right	1
to	1
complain	1
if	1
it	1
gives	1
him	1
the	1
go-by;	1
and	1
now	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
knocking	1
at	1
our	1
door,	1
it	1
will	1
not	1
do	1
to	1
shut	1
it	1
out;	1
let	1
us	1
go	1
with	1
the	1
favouring	1
breeze	1
that	1
blows	1
upon	1
us.”	1
It	1
is	1
this	1
sort	1
of	1
talk,	1
and	1
what	1
Sancho	1
says	1
lower	1
down,	1
that	1
made	1
the	1
translator	1
of	1
the	1
history	1
say	1
he	1
considered	1
this	1
chapter	1
apocryphal.	1
“Don’t	1
you	1
see,	1
you	1
animal,”	1
continued	1
Sancho,	1
“that	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
well	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
drop	1
into	1
some	1
profitable	1
government	1
that	1
will	1
lift	1
us	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
mire,	1
and	1
marry	1
Mari-Sancha	1
to	1
whom	1
I	1
like;	1
and	1
you	1
yourself	1
will	1
find	1
yourself	1
called	1
‘Doña	1
Teresa	1
Panza,’	1
and	1
sitting	1
in	1
church	1
on	1
a	1
fine	1
carpet	1
and	1
cushions	1
and	1
draperies,	1
in	1
spite	1
and	1
in	1
defiance	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
born	1
ladies	1
of	1
the	1
town?	1
No,	1
stay	1
as	1
you	1
are,	1
growing	1
neither	1
greater	1
nor	1
less,	1
like	1
a	1
tapestry	1
figure—Let	1
us	1
say	1
no	1
more	1
about	1
it,	1
for	1
Sanchica	1
shall	1
be	1
a	1
countess,	1
say	1
what	1
you	1
will.”	1
“Are	1
you	1
sure	1
of	1
all	1
you	1
say,	1
husband?”	1
replied	1
Teresa.	1
“Well,	1
for	1
all	1
that,	1
I	1
am	1
afraid	1
this	1
rank	1
of	1
countess	1
for	1
my	1
daughter	1
will	1
be	1
her	1
ruin.	1
You	1
do	1
as	1
you	1
like,	1
make	1
a	1
duchess	1
or	1
a	1
princess	1
of	1
her,	1
but	1
I	1
can	1
tell	1
you	1
it	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
with	1
my	1
will	1
and	1
consent.	1
I	1
was	1
always	1
a	1
lover	1
of	1
equality,	1
brother,	1
and	1
I	1
can’t	1
bear	1
to	1
see	1
people	1
give	1
themselves	1
airs	1
without	1
any	1
right.	1
They	1
called	1
me	1
Teresa	1
at	1
my	1
baptism,	1
a	1
plain,	1
simple	1
name,	1
without	1
any	1
additions	1
or	1
tags	1
or	1
fringes	1
of	1
Dons	1
or	1
Doñas;	1
Cascajo	1
was	1
my	1
father’s	1
name,	1
and	1
as	1
I	1
am	1
your	1
wife,	1
I	1
am	1
called	1
Teresa	1
Panza,	1
though	1
by	1
right	1
I	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
called	1
Teresa	1
Cascajo;	1
but	1
‘kings	1
go	1
where	1
laws	1
like,’	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
content	1
with	1
this	1
name	1
without	1
having	1
the	1
‘Don’	1
put	1
on	1
top	1
of	1
it	1
to	1
make	1
it	1
so	1
heavy	1
that	1
I	1
cannot	1
carry	1
it;	1
and	1
I	1
don’t	1
want	1
to	1
make	1
people	1
talk	1
about	1
me	1
when	1
they	1
see	1
me	1
go	1
dressed	1
like	1
a	1
countess	1
or	1
governor’s	1
wife;	1
for	1
they	1
will	1
say	1
at	1
once,	1
‘See	1
what	1
airs	1
the	1
slut	1
gives	1
herself!	1
Only	1
yesterday	1
she	1
was	1
always	1
spinning	1
flax,	1
and	1
used	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
mass	1
with	1
the	1
tail	1
of	1
her	1
petticoat	1
over	1
her	1
head	1
instead	1
of	1
a	1
mantle,	1
and	1
there	1
she	1
goes	1
to-day	1
in	1
a	1
hooped	1
gown	1
with	1
her	1
broaches	1
and	1
airs,	1
as	1
if	1
we	1
didn’t	1
know	1
her!’	1
If	1
God	1
keeps	1
me	1
in	1
my	1
seven	1
senses,	1
or	1
five,	1
or	1
whatever	1
number	1
I	1
have,	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
going	1
to	1
bring	1
myself	1
to	1
such	1
a	1
pass;	1
go	1
you,	1
brother,	1
and	1
be	1
a	1
government	1
or	1
an	1
island	1
man,	1
and	1
swagger	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
you	1
like;	1
for	1
by	1
the	1
soul	1
of	1
my	1
mother,	1
neither	1
my	1
daughter	1
nor	1
I	1
are	1
going	1
to	1
stir	1
a	1
step	1
from	1
our	1
village;	1
a	1
respectable	1
woman	1
should	1
have	1
a	1
broken	1
leg	1
and	1
keep	1
at	1
home;	1
and	1
to	1
be	1
busy	1
at	1
something	1
is	1
a	1
virtuous	1
damsel’s	1
holiday;	1
be	1
off	1
to	1
your	1
adventures	1
along	1
with	1
your	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
and	1
leave	1
us	1
to	1
our	1
misadventures,	1
for	1
God	1
will	1
mend	1
them	1
for	1
us	1
according	1
as	1
we	1
deserve	1
it.	1
I	1
don’t	1
know,	1
I’m	1
sure,	1
who	1
fixed	1
the	1
‘Don’	1
to	1
him,	1
what	1
neither	1
his	1
father	1
nor	1
grandfather	1
ever	1
had.”	1
“I	1
declare	1
thou	1
hast	1
a	1
devil	1
of	1
some	1
sort	1
in	1
thy	1
body!”	1
said	1
Sancho.	1
“God	1
help	1
thee,	1
what	1
a	1
lot	1
of	1
things	1
thou	1
hast	1
strung	1
together,	1
one	1
after	1
the	1
other,	1
without	1
head	1
or	1
tail!	1
What	1
have	1
Cascajo,	1
and	1
the	1
broaches	1
and	1
the	1
proverbs	1
and	1
the	1
airs,	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
what	1
I	1
say?	1
Look	1
here,	1
fool	1
and	1
dolt	1
(for	1
so	1
I	1
may	1
call	1
you,	1
when	1
you	1
don’t	1
understand	1
my	1
words,	1
and	1
run	1
away	1
from	1
good	1
fortune),	1
if	1
I	1
had	1
said	1
that	1
my	1
daughter	1
was	1
to	1
throw	1
herself	1
down	1
from	1
a	1
tower,	1
or	1
go	1
roaming	1
the	1
world,	1
as	1
the	1
Infanta	1
Doña	1
Urraca	1
wanted	1
to	1
do,	1
you	1
would	1
be	1
right	1
in	1
not	1
giving	1
way	1
to	1
my	1
will;	1
but	1
if	1
in	1
an	1
instant,	1
in	1
less	1
than	1
the	1
twinkling	1
of	1
an	1
eye,	1
I	1
put	1
the	1
‘Don’	1
and	1
‘my	1
lady’	1
on	1
her	1
back,	1
and	1
take	1
her	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
stubble,	1
and	1
place	1
her	1
under	1
a	1
canopy,	1
on	1
a	1
dais,	1
and	1
on	1
a	1
couch,	1
with	1
more	1
velvet	1
cushions	1
than	1
all	1
the	1
Almohades	1
of	1
Morocco	1
ever	1
had	1
in	1
their	1
family,	1
why	1
won’t	1
you	1
consent	1
and	1
fall	1
in	1
with	1
my	1
wishes?”	1
“Do	1
you	1
know	1
why,	1
husband?”	1
replied	1
Teresa;	1
“because	1
of	1
the	1
proverb	1
that	1
says	1
‘who	1
covers	1
thee,	1
discovers	1
thee.’	1
At	1
the	1
poor	1
man	1
people	1
only	1
throw	1
a	1
hasty	1
glance;	1
on	1
the	1
rich	1
man	1
they	1
fix	1
their	1
eyes;	1
and	1
if	1
the	1
said	1
rich	1
man	1
was	1
once	1
on	1
a	1
time	1
poor,	1
it	1
is	1
then	1
there	1
is	1
the	1
sneering	1
and	1
the	1
tattle	1
and	1
spite	1
of	1
backbiters;	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
streets	1
here	1
they	1
swarm	1
as	1
thick	1
as	1
bees.”	1
“Look	1
here,	1
Teresa,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“and	1
listen	1
to	1
what	1
I	1
am	1
now	1
going	1
to	1
say	1
to	1
you;	1
maybe	1
you	1
never	1
heard	1
it	1
in	1
all	1
your	1
life;	1
and	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
give	1
my	1
own	1
notions,	1
for	1
what	1
I	1
am	1
about	1
to	1
say	1
are	1
the	1
opinions	1
of	1
his	1
reverence	1
the	1
preacher,	1
who	1
preached	1
in	1
this	1
town	1
last	1
Lent,	1
and	1
who	1
said,	1
if	1
I	1
remember	1
rightly,	1
that	1
all	1
things	1
present	1
that	1
our	1
eyes	1
behold,	1
bring	1
themselves	1
before	1
us,	1
and	1
remain	1
and	1
fix	1
themselves	1
on	1
our	1
memory	1
much	1
better	1
and	1
more	1
forcibly	1
than	1
things	1
past.”	1
These	1
observations	1
which	1
Sancho	1
makes	1
here	1
are	1
the	1
other	1
ones	1
on	1
account	1
of	1
which	1
the	1
translator	1
says	1
he	1
regards	1
this	1
chapter	1
as	1
apocryphal,	1
inasmuch	1
as	1
they	1
are	1
beyond	1
Sancho’s	1
capacity.	1
“Whence	1
it	1
arises,”	1
he	1
continued,	1
“that	1
when	1
we	1
see	1
any	1
person	1
well	1
dressed	1
and	1
making	1
a	1
figure	1
with	1
rich	1
garments	1
and	1
retinue	1
of	1
servants,	1
it	1
seems	1
to	1
lead	1
and	1
impel	1
us	1
perforce	1
to	1
respect	1
him,	1
though	1
memory	1
may	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
moment	1
recall	1
to	1
us	1
some	1
lowly	1
condition	1
in	1
which	1
we	1
have	1
seen	1
him,	1
but	1
which,	1
whether	1
it	1
may	1
have	1
been	1
poverty	1
or	1
low	1
birth,	1
being	1
now	1
a	1
thing	1
of	1
the	1
past,	1
has	1
no	1
existence;	1
while	1
the	1
only	1
thing	1
that	1
has	1
any	1
existence	1
is	1
what	1
we	1
see	1
before	1
us;	1
and	1
if	1
this	1
person	1
whom	1
fortune	1
has	1
raised	1
from	1
his	1
original	1
lowly	1
state	1
(these	1
were	1
the	1
very	1
words	1
the	1
padre	1
used)	1
to	1
his	1
present	1
height	1
of	1
prosperity,	1
be	1
well	1
bred,	1
generous,	1
courteous	1
to	1
all,	1
without	1
seeking	1
to	1
vie	1
with	1
those	1
whose	1
nobility	1
is	1
of	1
ancient	1
date,	1
depend	1
upon	1
it,	1
Teresa,	1
no	1
one	1
will	1
remember	1
what	1
he	1
was,	1
and	1
everyone	1
will	1
respect	1
what	1
he	1
is,	1
except	1
indeed	1
the	1
envious,	1
from	1
whom	1
no	1
fair	1
fortune	1
is	1
safe.”	1
“I	1
do	1
not	1
understand	1
you,	1
husband,”	1
replied	1
Teresa;	1
“do	1
as	1
you	1
like,	1
and	1
don’t	1
break	1
my	1
head	1
with	1
any	1
more	1
speechifying	1
and	1
rethoric;	1
and	1
if	1
you	1
have	1
revolved	1
to	1
do	1
what	1
you	1
say—”	1
“Resolved,	1
you	1
should	1
say,	1
woman,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“not	1
revolved.”	1
“Don’t	1
set	1
yourself	1
to	1
wrangle	1
with	1
me,	1
husband,”	1
said	1
Teresa;	1
“I	1
speak	1
as	1
God	1
pleases,	1
and	1
don’t	1
deal	1
in	1
out-of-the-way	1
phrases;	1
and	1
I	1
say	1
if	1
you	1
are	1
bent	1
upon	1
having	1
a	1
government,	1
take	1
your	1
son	1
Sancho	1
with	1
you,	1
and	1
teach	1
him	1
from	1
this	1
time	1
on	1
how	1
to	1
hold	1
a	1
government;	1
for	1
sons	1
ought	1
to	1
inherit	1
and	1
learn	1
the	1
trades	1
of	1
their	1
fathers.”	1
“As	1
soon	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
the	1
government,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“I	1
will	1
send	1
for	1
him	1
by	1
post,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
send	1
thee	1
money,	1
of	1
which	1
I	1
shall	1
have	1
no	1
lack,	1
for	1
there	1
is	1
never	1
any	1
want	1
of	1
people	1
to	1
lend	1
it	1
to	1
governors	1
when	1
they	1
have	1
not	1
got	1
it;	1
and	1
do	1
thou	1
dress	1
him	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
hide	1
what	1
he	1
is	1
and	1
make	1
him	1
look	1
what	1
he	1
is	1
to	1
be.”	1
“You	1
send	1
the	1
money,”	1
said	1
Teresa,	1
“and	1
I’ll	1
dress	1
him	1
up	1
for	1
you	1
as	1
fine	1
as	1
you	1
please.”	1
“Then	1
we	1
are	1
agreed	1
that	1
our	1
daughter	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
countess,”	1
said	1
Sancho.	1
“The	1
day	1
that	1
I	1
see	1
her	1
a	1
countess,”	1
replied	1
Teresa,	1
“it	1
will	1
be	1
the	1
same	1
to	1
me	1
as	1
if	1
I	1
was	1
burying	1
her;	1
but	1
once	1
more	1
I	1
say	1
do	1
as	1
you	1
please,	1
for	1
we	1
women	1
are	1
born	1
to	1
this	1
burden	1
of	1
being	1
obedient	1
to	1
our	1
husbands,	1
though	1
they	1
be	1
dogs;”	1
and	1
with	1
this	1
she	1
began	1
to	1
weep	1
in	1
earnest,	1
as	1
if	1
she	1
already	1
saw	1
Sanchica	1
dead	1
and	1
buried.	1
Sancho	1
consoled	1
her	1
by	1
saying	1
that	1
though	1
he	1
must	1
make	1
her	1
a	1
countess,	1
he	1
would	1
put	1
it	1
off	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
possible.	1
Here	1
their	1
conversation	1
came	1
to	1
an	1
end,	1
and	1
Sancho	1
went	1
back	1
to	1
see	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
and	1
make	1
arrangements	1
for	1
their	1
departure.	1

While	1
Sancho	1
Panza	1
and	1
his	1
wife,	1
Teresa	1
Cascajo,	1
held	1
the	1
above	1
irrelevant	1
conversation,	1
Don	1
Quixote’s	1
niece	1
and	1
housekeeper	1
were	1
not	1
idle,	1
for	1
by	1
a	1
thousand	1
signs	1
they	1
began	1
to	1
perceive	1
that	1
their	1
uncle	1
and	1
master	1
meant	1
to	1
give	1
them	1
the	1
slip	1
the	1
third	1
time,	1
and	1
once	1
more	1
betake	1
himself	1
to	1
his,	1
for	1
them,	1
ill-errant	1
chivalry.	1
They	1
strove	1
by	1
all	1
the	1
means	1
in	1
their	1
power	1
to	1
divert	1
him	1
from	1
such	1
an	1
unlucky	1
scheme;	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
all	1
preaching	1
in	1
the	1
desert	1
and	1
hammering	1
cold	1
iron.	1
Nevertheless,	1
among	1
many	1
other	1
representations	1
made	1
to	1
him,	1
the	1
housekeeper	1
said	1
to	1
him,	1
“In	1
truth,	1
master,	1
if	1
you	1
do	1
not	1
keep	1
still	1
and	1
stay	1
quiet	1
at	1
home,	1
and	1
give	1
over	1
roaming	1
mountains	1
and	1
valleys	1
like	1
a	1
troubled	1
spirit,	1
looking	1
for	1
what	1
they	1
say	1
are	1
called	1
adventures,	1
but	1
what	1
I	1
call	1
misfortunes,	1
I	1
shall	1
have	1
to	1
make	1
complaint	1
to	1
God	1
and	1
the	1
king	1
with	1
loud	1
supplication	1
to	1
send	1
some	1
remedy.”	1
To	1
which	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
replied,	1
“What	1
answer	1
God	1
will	1
give	1
to	1
your	1
complaints,	1
housekeeper,	1
I	1
know	1
not,	1
nor	1
what	1
his	1
Majesty	1
will	1
answer	1
either;	1
I	1
only	1
know	1
that	1
if	1
I	1
were	1
king	1
I	1
should	1
decline	1
to	1
answer	1
the	1
numberless	1
silly	1
petitions	1
they	1
present	1
every	1
day;	1
for	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
greatest	1
among	1
the	1
many	1
troubles	1
kings	1
have	1
is	1
being	1
obliged	1
to	1
listen	1
to	1
all	1
and	1
answer	1
all,	1
and	1
therefore	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
sorry	1
that	1
any	1
affairs	1
of	1
mine	1
should	1
worry	1
him.”	1
Whereupon	1
the	1
housekeeper	1
said,	1
“Tell	1
us,	1
señor,	1
at	1
his	1
Majesty’s	1
court	1
are	1
there	1
no	1
knights?”	1
“There	1
are,”	1
replied	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“and	1
plenty	1
of	1
them;	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
right	1
there	1
should	1
be,	1
to	1
set	1
off	1
the	1
dignity	1
of	1
the	1
prince,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
greater	1
glory	1
of	1
the	1
king’s	1
majesty.”	1
“Then	1
might	1
not	1
your	1
worship,”	1
said	1
she,	1
“be	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
that,	1
without	1
stirring	1
a	1
step,	1
serve	1
their	1
king	1
and	1
lord	1
in	1
his	1
court?”	1
“Recollect,	1
my	1
friend,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“all	1
knights	1
cannot	1
be	1
courtiers,	1
nor	1
can	1
all	1
courtiers	1
be	1
knights-errant,	1
nor	1
need	1
they	1
be.	1
There	1
must	1
be	1
all	1
sorts	1
in	1
the	1
world;	1
and	1
though	1
we	1
may	1
be	1
all	1
knights,	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
great	1
difference	1
between	1
one	1
and	1
another;	1
for	1
the	1
courtiers,	1
without	1
quitting	1
their	1
chambers,	1
or	1
the	1
threshold	1
of	1
the	1
court,	1
range	1
the	1
world	1
over	1
by	1
looking	1
at	1
a	1
map,	1
without	1
its	1
costing	1
them	1
a	1
farthing,	1
and	1
without	1
suffering	1
heat	1
or	1
cold,	1
hunger	1
or	1
thirst;	1
but	1
we,	1
the	1
true	1
knights-errant,	1
measure	1
the	1
whole	1
earth	1
with	1
our	1
own	1
feet,	1
exposed	1
to	1
the	1
sun,	1
to	1
the	1
cold,	1
to	1
the	1
air,	1
to	1
the	1
inclemencies	1
of	1
heaven,	1
by	1
day	1
and	1
night,	1
on	1
foot	1
and	1
on	1
horseback;	1
nor	1
do	1
we	1
only	1
know	1
enemies	1
in	1
pictures,	1
but	1
in	1
their	1
own	1
real	1
shapes;	1
and	1
at	1
all	1
risks	1
and	1
on	1
all	1
occasions	1
we	1
attack	1
them,	1
without	1
any	1
regard	1
to	1
childish	1
points	1
or	1
rules	1
of	1
single	1
combat,	1
whether	1
one	1
has	1
or	1
has	1
not	1
a	1
shorter	1
lance	1
or	1
sword,	1
whether	1
one	1
carries	1
relics	1
or	1
any	1
secret	1
contrivance	1
about	1
him,	1
whether	1
or	1
not	1
the	1
sun	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
divided	1
and	1
portioned	1
out,	1
and	1
other	1
niceties	1
of	1
the	1
sort	1
that	1
are	1
observed	1
in	1
set	1
combats	1
of	1
man	1
to	1
man,	1
that	1
you	1
know	1
nothing	1
about,	1
but	1
I	1
do.	1
And	1
you	1
must	1
know	1
besides,	1
that	1
the	1
true	1
knight-errant,	1
though	1
he	1
may	1
see	1
ten	1
giants,	1
that	1
not	1
only	1
touch	1
the	1
clouds	1
with	1
their	1
heads	1
but	1
pierce	1
them,	1
and	1
that	1
go,	1
each	1
of	1
them,	1
on	1
two	1
tall	1
towers	1
by	1
way	1
of	1
legs,	1
and	1
whose	1
arms	1
are	1
like	1
the	1
masts	1
of	1
mighty	1
ships,	1
and	1
each	1
eye	1
like	1
a	1
great	1
mill-wheel,	1
and	1
glowing	1
brighter	1
than	1
a	1
glass	1
furnace,	1
must	1
not	1
on	1
any	1
account	1
be	1
dismayed	1
by	1
them.	1
On	1
the	1
contrary,	1
he	1
must	1
attack	1
and	1
fall	1
upon	1
them	1
with	1
a	1
gallant	1
bearing	1
and	1
a	1
fearless	1
heart,	1
and,	1
if	1
possible,	1
vanquish	1
and	1
destroy	1
them,	1
even	1
though	1
they	1
have	1
for	1
armour	1
the	1
shells	1
of	1
a	1
certain	1
fish,	1
that	1
they	1
say	1
are	1
harder	1
than	1
diamonds,	1
and	1
in	1
place	1
of	1
swords	1
wield	1
trenchant	1
blades	1
of	1
Damascus	1
steel,	1
or	1
clubs	1
studded	1
with	1
spikes	1
also	1
of	1
steel,	1
such	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
more	1
than	1
once	1
seen.	1
All	1
this	1
I	1
say,	1
housekeeper,	1
that	1
you	1
may	1
see	1
the	1
difference	1
there	1
is	1
between	1
the	1
one	1
sort	1
of	1
knight	1
and	1
the	1
other;	1
and	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
well	1
if	1
there	1
were	1
no	1
prince	1
who	1
did	1
not	1
set	1
a	1
higher	1
value	1
on	1
this	1
second,	1
or	1
more	1
properly	1
speaking	1
first,	1
kind	1
of	1
knights-errant;	1
for,	1
as	1
we	1
read	1
in	1
their	1
histories,	1
there	1
have	1
been	1
some	1
among	1
them	1
who	1
have	1
been	1
the	1
salvation,	1
not	1
merely	1
of	1
one	1
kingdom,	1
but	1
of	1
many.”	1
“Ah,	1
señor,”	1
here	1
exclaimed	1
the	1
niece,	1
“remember	1
that	1
all	1
this	1
you	1
are	1
saying	1
about	1
knights-errant	1
is	1
fable	1
and	1
fiction;	1
and	1
their	1
histories,	1
if	1
indeed	1
they	1
were	1
not	1
burned,	1
would	1
deserve,	1
each	1
of	1
them,	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
sambenito	1
put	1
on	1
it,	1
or	1
some	1
mark	1
by	1
which	1
it	1
might	1
be	1
known	1
as	1
infamous	1
and	1
a	1
corrupter	1
of	1
good	1
manners.”	1
“By	1
the	1
God	1
that	1
gives	1
me	1
life,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“if	1
thou	1
wert	1
not	1
my	1
full	1
niece,	1
being	1
daughter	1
of	1
my	1
own	1
sister,	1
I	1
would	1
inflict	1
a	1
chastisement	1
upon	1
thee	1
for	1
the	1
blasphemy	1
thou	1
hast	1
uttered	1
that	1
all	1
the	1
world	1
should	1
ring	1
with.	1
What!	1
can	1
it	1
be	1
that	1
a	1
young	1
hussy	1
that	1
hardly	1
knows	1
how	1
to	1
handle	1
a	1
dozen	1
lace-bobbins	1
dares	1
to	1
wag	1
her	1
tongue	1
and	1
criticise	1
the	1
histories	1
of	1
knights-errant?	1
What	1
would	1
Señor	1
Amadis	1
say	1
if	1
he	1
heard	1
of	1
such	1
a	1
thing?	1
He,	1
however,	1
no	1
doubt	1
would	1
forgive	1
thee,	1
for	1
he	1
was	1
the	1
most	1
humble-minded	1
and	1
courteous	1
knight	1
of	1
his	1
time,	1
and	1
moreover	1
a	1
great	1
protector	1
of	1
damsels;	1
but	1
some	1
there	1
are	1
that	1
might	1
have	1
heard	1
thee,	1
and	1
it	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
been	1
well	1
for	1
thee	1
in	1
that	1
case;	1
for	1
they	1
are	1
not	1
all	1
courteous	1
or	1
mannerly;	1
some	1
are	1
ill-conditioned	1
scoundrels;	1
nor	1
is	1
it	1
everyone	1
that	1
calls	1
himself	1
a	1
gentleman,	1
that	1
is	1
so	1
in	1
all	1
respects;	1
some	1
are	1
gold,	1
others	1
pinchbeck,	1
and	1
all	1
look	1
like	1
gentlemen,	1
but	1
not	1
all	1
can	1
stand	1
the	1
touchstone	1
of	1
truth.	1
There	1
are	1
men	1
of	1
low	1
rank	1
who	1
strain	1
themselves	1
to	1
bursting	1
to	1
pass	1
for	1
gentlemen,	1
and	1
high	1
gentlemen	1
who,	1
one	1
would	1
fancy,	1
were	1
dying	1
to	1
pass	1
for	1
men	1
of	1
low	1
rank;	1
the	1
former	1
raise	1
themselves	1
by	1
their	1
ambition	1
or	1
by	1
their	1
virtues,	1
the	1
latter	1
debase	1
themselves	1
by	1
their	1
lack	1
of	1
spirit	1
or	1
by	1
their	1
vices;	1
and	1
one	1
has	1
need	1
of	1
experience	1
and	1
discernment	1
to	1
distinguish	1
these	1
two	1
kinds	1
of	1
gentlemen,	1
so	1
much	1
alike	1
in	1
name	1
and	1
so	1
different	1
in	1
conduct.”	1
“God	1
bless	1
me!”	1
said	1
the	1
niece,	1
“that	1
you	1
should	1
know	1
so	1
much,	1
uncle—enough,	1
if	1
need	1
be,	1
to	1
get	1
up	1
into	1
a	1
pulpit	1
and	1
go	1
preach	1
in	1
the	1
streets—and	1
yet	1
that	1
you	1
should	1
fall	1
into	1
a	1
delusion	1
so	1
great	1
and	1
a	1
folly	1
so	1
manifest	1
as	1
to	1
try	1
to	1
make	1
yourself	1
out	1
vigorous	1
when	1
you	1
are	1
old,	1
strong	1
when	1
you	1
are	1
sickly,	1
able	1
to	1
put	1
straight	1
what	1
is	1
crooked	1
when	1
you	1
yourself	1
are	1
bent	1
by	1
age,	1
and,	1
above	1
all,	1
a	1
caballero	1
when	1
you	1
are	1
not	1
one;	1
for	1
though	1
gentlefolk	1
may	1
be	1
so,	1
poor	1
men	1
are	1
nothing	1
of	1
the	1
kind!”	1
“There	1
is	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
of	1
truth	1
in	1
what	1
you	1
say,	1
niece,”	1
returned	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“and	1
I	1
could	1
tell	1
you	1
somewhat	1
about	1
birth	1
that	1
would	1
astonish	1
you;	1
but,	1
not	1
to	1
mix	1
up	1
things	1
human	1
and	1
divine,	1
I	1
refrain.	1
Look	1
you,	1
my	1
dears,	1
all	1
the	1
lineages	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
(attend	1
to	1
what	1
I	1
am	1
saying)	1
can	1
be	1
reduced	1
to	1
four	1
sorts,	1
which	1
are	1
these:	1
those	1
that	1
had	1
humble	1
beginnings,	1
and	1
went	1
on	1
spreading	1
and	1
extending	1
themselves	1
until	1
they	1
attained	1
surpassing	1
greatness;	1
those	1
that	1
had	1
great	1
beginnings	1
and	1
maintained	1
them,	1
and	1
still	1
maintain	1
and	1
uphold	1
the	1
greatness	1
of	1
their	1
origin;	1
those,	1
again,	1
that	1
from	1
a	1
great	1
beginning	1
have	1
ended	1
in	1
a	1
point	1
like	1
a	1
pyramid,	1
having	1
reduced	1
and	1
lessened	1
their	1
original	1
greatness	1
till	1
it	1
has	1
come	1
to	1
nought,	1
like	1
the	1
point	1
of	1
a	1
pyramid,	1
which,	1
relatively	1
to	1
its	1
base	1
or	1
foundation,	1
is	1
nothing;	1
and	1
then	1
there	1
are	1
those—and	1
it	1
is	1
they	1
that	1
are	1
the	1
most	1
numerous—that	1
have	1
had	1
neither	1
an	1
illustrious	1
beginning	1
nor	1
a	1
remarkable	1
mid-course,	1
and	1
so	1
will	1
have	1
an	1
end	1
without	1
a	1
name,	1
like	1
an	1
ordinary	1
plebeian	1
line.	1
Of	1
the	1
first,	1
those	1
that	1
had	1
an	1
humble	1
origin	1
and	1
rose	1
to	1
the	1
greatness	1
they	1
still	1
preserve,	1
the	1
Ottoman	1
house	1
may	1
serve	1
as	1
an	1
example,	1
which	1
from	1
an	1
humble	1
and	1
lowly	1
shepherd,	1
its	1
founder,	1
has	1
reached	1
the	1
height	1
at	1
which	1
we	1
now	1
see	1
it.	1
For	1
examples	1
of	1
the	1
second	1
sort	1
of	1
lineage,	1
that	1
began	1
with	1
greatness	1
and	1
maintains	1
it	1
still	1
without	1
adding	1
to	1
it,	1
there	1
are	1
the	1
many	1
princes	1
who	1
have	1
inherited	1
the	1
dignity,	1
and	1
maintain	1
themselves	1
in	1
their	1
inheritance,	1
without	1
increasing	1
or	1
diminishing	1
it,	1
keeping	1
peacefully	1
within	1
the	1
limits	1
of	1
their	1
states.	1
Of	1
those	1
that	1
began	1
great	1
and	1
ended	1
in	1
a	1
point,	1
there	1
are	1
thousands	1
of	1
examples,	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
Pharaohs	1
and	1
Ptolemies	1
of	1
Egypt,	1
the	1
Cæsars	1
of	1
Rome,	1
and	1
the	1
whole	1
herd	1
(if	1
I	1
may	1
apply	1
such	1
a	1
word	1
to	1
them)	1
of	1
countless	1
princes,	1
monarchs,	1
lords,	1
Medes,	1
Assyrians,	1
Persians,	1
Greeks,	1
and	1
barbarians,	1
all	1
these	1
lineages	1
and	1
lordships	1
have	1
ended	1
in	1
a	1
point	1
and	1
come	1
to	1
nothing,	1
they	1
themselves	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
their	1
founders,	1
for	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
impossible	1
now	1
to	1
find	1
one	1
of	1
their	1
descendants,	1
and,	1
even	1
should	1
we	1
find	1
one,	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
in	1
some	1
lowly	1
and	1
humble	1
condition.	1
Of	1
plebeian	1
lineages	1
I	1
have	1
nothing	1
to	1
say,	1
save	1
that	1
they	1
merely	1
serve	1
to	1
swell	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
those	1
that	1
live,	1
without	1
any	1
eminence	1
to	1
entitle	1
them	1
to	1
any	1
fame	1
or	1
praise	1
beyond	1
this.	1
From	1
all	1
I	1
have	1
said	1
I	1
would	1
have	1
you	1
gather,	1
my	1
poor	1
innocents,	1
that	1
great	1
is	1
the	1
confusion	1
among	1
lineages,	1
and	1
that	1
only	1
those	1
are	1
seen	1
to	1
be	1
great	1
and	1
illustrious	1
that	1
show	1
themselves	1
so	1
by	1
the	1
virtue,	1
wealth,	1
and	1
generosity	1
of	1
their	1
possessors.	1
I	1
have	1
said	1
virtue,	1
wealth,	1
and	1
generosity,	1
because	1
a	1
great	1
man	1
who	1
is	1
vicious	1
will	1
be	1
a	1
great	1
example	1
of	1
vice,	1
and	1
a	1
rich	1
man	1
who	1
is	1
not	1
generous	1
will	1
be	1
merely	1
a	1
miserly	1
beggar;	1
for	1
the	1
possessor	1
of	1
wealth	1
is	1
not	1
made	1
happy	1
by	1
possessing	1
it,	1
but	1
by	1
spending	1
it,	1
and	1
not	1
by	1
spending	1
as	1
he	1
pleases,	1
but	1
by	1
knowing	1
how	1
to	1
spend	1
it	1
well.	1
The	1
poor	1
gentleman	1
has	1
no	1
way	1
of	1
showing	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
gentleman	1
but	1
by	1
virtue,	1
by	1
being	1
affable,	1
well-bred,	1
courteous,	1
gentle-mannered,	1
and	1
kindly,	1
not	1
haughty,	1
arrogant,	1
or	1
censorious,	1
but	1
above	1
all	1
by	1
being	1
charitable;	1
for	1
by	1
two	1
maravedis	1
given	1
with	1
a	1
cheerful	1
heart	1
to	1
the	1
poor,	1
he	1
will	1
show	1
himself	1
as	1
generous	1
as	1
he	1
who	1
distributes	1
alms	1
with	1
bell-ringing,	1
and	1
no	1
one	1
that	1
perceives	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
endowed	1
with	1
the	1
virtues	1
I	1
have	1
named,	1
even	1
though	1
he	1
know	1
him	1
not,	1
will	1
fail	1
to	1
recognise	1
and	1
set	1
him	1
down	1
as	1
one	1
of	1
good	1
blood;	1
and	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
strange	1
were	1
it	1
not	1
so;	1
praise	1
has	1
ever	1
been	1
the	1
reward	1
of	1
virtue,	1
and	1
those	1
who	1
are	1
virtuous	1
cannot	1
fail	1
to	1
receive	1
commendation.	1
There	1
are	1
two	1
roads,	1
my	1
daughters,	1
by	1
which	1
men	1
may	1
reach	1
wealth	1
and	1
honours;	1
one	1
is	1
that	1
of	1
letters,	1
the	1
other	1
that	1
of	1
arms.	1
I	1
have	1
more	1
of	1
arms	1
than	1
of	1
letters	1
in	1
my	1
composition,	1
and,	1
judging	1
by	1
my	1
inclination	1
to	1
arms,	1
was	1
born	1
under	1
the	1
influence	1
of	1
the	1
planet	1
Mars.	1
I	1
am,	1
therefore,	1
in	1
a	1
measure	1
constrained	1
to	1
follow	1
that	1
road,	1
and	1
by	1
it	1
I	1
must	1
travel	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
world,	1
and	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
labour	1
in	1
vain	1
for	1
you	1
to	1
urge	1
me	1
to	1
resist	1
what	1
heaven	1
wills,	1
fate	1
ordains,	1
reason	1
requires,	1
and,	1
above	1
all,	1
my	1
own	1
inclination	1
favours;	1
for	1
knowing	1
as	1
I	1
do	1
the	1
countless	1
toils	1
that	1
are	1
the	1
accompaniments	1
of	1
knight-errantry,	1
I	1
know,	1
too,	1
the	1
infinite	1
blessings	1
that	1
are	1
attained	1
by	1
it;	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
the	1
path	1
of	1
virtue	1
is	1
very	1
narrow,	1
and	1
the	1
road	1
of	1
vice	1
broad	1
and	1
spacious;	1
I	1
know	1
their	1
ends	1
and	1
goals	1
are	1
different,	1
for	1
the	1
broad	1
and	1
easy	1
road	1
of	1
vice	1
ends	1
in	1
death,	1
and	1
the	1
narrow	1
and	1
toilsome	1
one	1
of	1
virtue	1
in	1
life,	1
and	1
not	1
transitory	1
life,	1
but	1
in	1
that	1
which	1
has	1
no	1
end;	1
I	1
know,	1
as	1
our	1
great	1
Castilian	1
poet	1
says,	1
that-	1
It	1
is	1
by	1
rugged	1
paths	1
like	1
these	1
they	1
go	1
That	1
scale	1
the	1
heights	1
of	1
immortality,	1
Unreached	1
by	1
those	1
that	1
falter	1
here	1
below.”	1
“Woe	1
is	1
me!”	1
exclaimed	1
the	1
niece,	1
“my	1
lord	1
is	1
a	1
poet,	1
too!	1
He	1
knows	1
everything,	1
and	1
he	1
can	1
do	1
everything;	1
I	1
will	1
bet,	1
if	1
he	1
chose	1
to	1
turn	1
mason,	1
he	1
could	1
make	1
a	1
house	1
as	1
easily	1
as	1
a	1
cage.”	1
“I	1
can	1
tell	1
you,	1
niece,”	1
replied	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“if	1
these	1
chivalrous	1
thoughts	1
did	1
not	1
engage	1
all	1
my	1
faculties,	1
there	1
would	1
be	1
nothing	1
that	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
do,	1
nor	1
any	1
sort	1
of	1
knickknack	1
that	1
would	1
not	1
come	1
from	1
my	1
hands,	1
particularly	1
cages	1
and	1
tooth-picks.”	1
At	1
this	1
moment	1
there	1
came	1
a	1
knocking	1
at	1
the	1
door,	1
and	1
when	1
they	1
asked	1
who	1
was	1
there,	1
Sancho	1
Panza	1
made	1
answer	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
he.	1
The	1
instant	1
the	1
housekeeper	1
knew	1
who	1
it	1
was,	1
she	1
ran	1
to	1
hide	1
herself	1
so	1
as	1
not	1
to	1
see	1
him;	1
in	1
such	1
abhorrence	1
did	1
she	1
hold	1
him.	1
The	1
niece	1
let	1
him	1
in,	1
and	1
his	1
master	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
came	1
forward	1
to	1
receive	1
him	1
with	1
open	1
arms,	1
and	1
the	1
pair	1
shut	1
themselves	1
up	1
in	1
his	1
room,	1
where	1
they	1
had	1
another	1
conversation	1
not	1
inferior	1
to	1
the	1
previous	1
one.	1

The	1
instant	1
the	1
housekeeper	1
saw	1
Sancho	1
Panza	1
shut	1
himself	1
in	1
with	1
her	1
master,	1
she	1
guessed	1
what	1
they	1
were	1
about;	1
and	1
suspecting	1
that	1
the	1
result	1
of	1
the	1
consultation	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
resolve	1
to	1
undertake	1
a	1
third	1
sally,	1
she	1
seized	1
her	1
mantle,	1
and	1
in	1
deep	1
anxiety	1
and	1
distress,	1
ran	1
to	1
find	1
the	1
bachelor	1
Samson	1
Carrasco,	1
as	1
she	1
thought	1
that,	1
being	1
a	1
well-spoken	1
man,	1
and	1
a	1
new	1
friend	1
of	1
her	1
master’s,	1
he	1
might	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
persuade	1
him	1
to	1
give	1
up	1
any	1
such	1
crazy	1
notion.	1
She	1
found	1
him	1
pacing	1
the	1
patio	1
of	1
his	1
house,	1
and,	1
perspiring	1
and	1
flurried,	1
she	1
fell	1
at	1
his	1
feet	1
the	1
moment	1
she	1
saw	1
him.	1
Carrasco,	1
seeing	1
how	1
distressed	1
and	1
overcome	1
she	1
was,	1
said	1
to	1
her,	1
“What	1
is	1
this,	1
mistress	1
housekeeper?	1
What	1
has	1
happened	1
to	1
you?	1
One	1
would	1
think	1
you	1
heart-broken.”	1
“Nothing,	1
Señor	1
Samson,”	1
said	1
she,	1
“only	1
that	1
my	1
master	1
is	1
breaking	1
out,	1
plainly	1
breaking	1
out.”	1
“Whereabouts	1
is	1
he	1
breaking	1
out,	1
señora?”	1
asked	1
Samson;	1
“has	1
any	1
part	1
of	1
his	1
body	1
burst?”	1
“He	1
is	1
only	1
breaking	1
out	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
his	1
madness,”	1
she	1
replied;	1
“I	1
mean,	1
dear	1
señor	1
bachelor,	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
going	1
to	1
break	1
out	1
again	1
(and	1
this	1
will	1
be	1
the	1
third	1
time)	1
to	1
hunt	1
all	1
over	1
the	1
world	1
for	1
what	1
he	1
calls	1
ventures,	1
though	1
I	1
can’t	1
make	1
out	1
why	1
he	1
gives	1
them	1
that	1
name.	1
The	1
first	1
time	1
he	1
was	1
brought	1
back	1
to	1
us	1
slung	1
across	1
the	1
back	1
of	1
an	1
ass,	1
and	1
belaboured	1
all	1
over;	1
and	1
the	1
second	1
time	1
he	1
came	1
in	1
an	1
ox-cart,	1
shut	1
up	1
in	1
a	1
cage,	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
persuaded	1
himself	1
he	1
was	1
enchanted,	1
and	1
the	1
poor	1
creature	1
was	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
state	1
that	1
the	1
mother	1
that	1
bore	1
him	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
known	1
him;	1
lean,	1
yellow,	1
with	1
his	1
eyes	1
sunk	1
deep	1
in	1
the	1
cells	1
of	1
his	1
skull;	1
so	1
that	1
to	1
bring	1
him	1
round	1
again,	1
ever	1
so	1
little,	1
cost	1
me	1
more	1
than	1
six	1
hundred	1
eggs,	1
as	1
God	1
knows,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
world,	1
and	1
my	1
hens	1
too,	1
that	1
won’t	1
let	1
me	1
tell	1
a	1
lie.”	1
“That	1
I	1
can	1
well	1
believe,”	1
replied	1
the	1
bachelor,	1
“for	1
they	1
are	1
so	1
good	1
and	1
so	1
fat,	1
and	1
so	1
well-bred,	1
that	1
they	1
would	1
not	1
say	1
one	1
thing	1
for	1
another,	1
though	1
they	1
were	1
to	1
burst	1
for	1
it.	1
In	1
short	1
then,	1
mistress	1
housekeeper,	1
that	1
is	1
all,	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
nothing	1
the	1
matter,	1
except	1
what	1
it	1
is	1
feared	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
may	1
do?”	1
“No,	1
señor,”	1
said	1
she.	1
“Well	1
then,”	1
returned	1
the	1
bachelor,	1
“don’t	1
be	1
uneasy,	1
but	1
go	1
home	1
in	1
peace;	1
get	1
me	1
ready	1
something	1
hot	1
for	1
breakfast,	1
and	1
while	1
you	1
are	1
on	1
the	1
way	1
say	1
the	1
prayer	1
of	1
Santa	1
Apollonia,	1
that	1
is	1
if	1
you	1
know	1
it;	1
for	1
I	1
will	1
come	1
presently	1
and	1
you	1
will	1
see	1
miracles.”	1
“Woe	1
is	1
me,”	1
cried	1
the	1
housekeeper,	1
“is	1
it	1
the	1
prayer	1
of	1
Santa	1
Apollonia	1
you	1
would	1
have	1
me	1
say?	1
That	1
would	1
do	1
if	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
toothache	1
my	1
master	1
had;	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
brains,	1
what	1
he	1
has	1
got.”	1
“I	1
know	1
what	1
I	1
am	1
saying,	1
mistress	1
housekeeper;	1
go,	1
and	1
don’t	1
set	1
yourself	1
to	1
argue	1
with	1
me,	1
for	1
you	1
know	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
bachelor	1
of	1
Salamanca,	1
and	1
one	1
can’t	1
be	1
more	1
of	1
a	1
bachelor	1
than	1
that,”	1
replied	1
Carrasco;	1
and	1
with	1
this	1
the	1
housekeeper	1
retired,	1
and	1
the	1
bachelor	1
went	1
to	1
look	1
for	1
the	1
curate,	1
and	1
arrange	1
with	1
him	1
what	1
will	1
be	1
told	1
in	1
its	1
proper	1
place.	1
While	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
and	1
Sancho	1
were	1
shut	1
up	1
together,	1
they	1
had	1
a	1
discussion	1
which	1
the	1
history	1
records	1
with	1
great	1
precision	1
and	1
scrupulous	1
exactness.	1
Sancho	1
said	1
to	1
his	1
master,	1
“Señor,	1
I	1
have	1
educed	1
my	1
wife	1
to	1
let	1
me	1
go	1
with	1
your	1
worship	1
wherever	1
you	1
choose	1
to	1
take	1
me.”	1
“Induced,	1
you	1
should	1
say,	1
Sancho,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
“not	1
educed.”	1
“Once	1
or	1
twice,	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
I	1
remember,”	1
replied	1
Sancho,	1
“I	1
have	1
begged	1
of	1
your	1
worship	1
not	1
to	1
mend	1
my	1
words,	1
if	1
so	1
be	1
as	1
you	1
understand	1
what	1
I	1
mean	1
by	1
them;	1
and	1
if	1
you	1
don’t	1
understand	1
them	1
to	1
say	1
‘Sancho,’	1
or	1
‘devil,’	1
‘I	1
don’t	1
understand	1
thee;	1
and	1
if	1
I	1
don’t	1
make	1
my	1
meaning	1
plain,	1
then	1
you	1
may	1
correct	1
me,	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
so	1
focile—”	1
“I	1
don’t	1
understand	1
thee,	1
Sancho,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
at	1
once;	1
“for	1
I	1
know	1
not	1
what	1
‘I	1
am	1
so	1
focile’	1
means.”	1
“‘So	1
focile’	1
means	1
I	1
am	1
so	1
much	1
that	1
way,”	1
replied	1
Sancho.	1
“I	1
understand	1
thee	1
still	1
less	1
now,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote.	1
“Well,	1
if	1
you	1
can’t	1
understand	1
me,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“I	1
don’t	1
know	1
how	1
to	1
put	1
it;	1
I	1
know	1
no	1
more,	1
God	1
help	1
me.”	1
“Oh,	1
now	1
I	1
have	1
hit	1
it,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
“thou	1
wouldst	1
say	1
thou	1
art	1
so	1
docile,	1
tractable,	1
and	1
gentle	1
that	1
thou	1
wilt	1
take	1
what	1
I	1
say	1
to	1
thee,	1
and	1
submit	1
to	1
what	1
I	1
teach	1
thee.”	1
“I	1
would	1
bet,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“that	1
from	1
the	1
very	1
first	1
you	1
understood	1
me,	1
and	1
knew	1
what	1
I	1
meant,	1
but	1
you	1
wanted	1
to	1
put	1
me	1
out	1
that	1
you	1
might	1
hear	1
me	1
make	1
another	1
couple	1
of	1
dozen	1
blunders.”	1
“May	1
be	1
so,”	1
replied	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
“but	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
point,	1
what	1
does	1
Teresa	1
say?”	1
“Teresa	1
says,”	1
replied	1
Sancho,	1
“that	1
I	1
should	1
make	1
sure	1
with	1
your	1
worship,	1
and	1
‘let	1
papers	1
speak	1
and	1
beards	1
be	1
still,’	1
for	1
‘he	1
who	1
binds	1
does	1
not	1
wrangle,’	1
since	1
one	1
‘take’	1
is	1
better	1
than	1
two	1
‘I’ll	1
give	1
thee’s;’	1
and	1
I	1
say	1
a	1
woman’s	1
advice	1
is	1
no	1
great	1
thing,	1
and	1
he	1
who	1
won’t	1
take	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
fool.”	1
“And	1
so	1
say	1
I,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
“continue,	1
Sancho	1
my	1
friend;	1
go	1
on;	1
you	1
talk	1
pearls	1
to-day.”	1
“The	1
fact	1
is,”	1
continued	1
Sancho,	1
“that,	1
as	1
your	1
worship	1
knows	1
better	1
than	1
I	1
do,	1
we	1
are	1
all	1
of	1
us	1
liable	1
to	1
death,	1
and	1
to-day	1
we	1
are,	1
and	1
to-morrow	1
we	1
are	1
not,	1
and	1
the	1
lamb	1
goes	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
the	1
sheep,	1
and	1
nobody	1
can	1
promise	1
himself	1
more	1
hours	1
of	1
life	1
in	1
this	1
world	1
than	1
God	1
may	1
be	1
pleased	1
to	1
give	1
him;	1
for	1
death	1
is	1
deaf,	1
and	1
when	1
it	1
comes	1
to	1
knock	1
at	1
our	1
life’s	1
door,	1
it	1
is	1
always	1
urgent,	1
and	1
neither	1
prayers,	1
nor	1
struggles,	1
nor	1
sceptres,	1
nor	1
mitres,	1
can	1
keep	1
it	1
back,	1
as	1
common	1
talk	1
and	1
report	1
say,	1
and	1
as	1
they	1
tell	1
us	1
from	1
the	1
pulpits	1
every	1
day.”	1
“All	1
that	1
is	1
very	1
true,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
“but	1
I	1
cannot	1
make	1
out	1
what	1
thou	1
art	1
driving	1
at.”	1
“What	1
I	1
am	1
driving	1
at,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“is	1
that	1
your	1
worship	1
settle	1
some	1
fixed	1
wages	1
for	1
me,	1
to	1
be	1
paid	1
monthly	1
while	1
I	1
am	1
in	1
your	1
service,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
same	1
be	1
paid	1
me	1
out	1
of	1
your	1
estate;	1
for	1
I	1
don’t	1
care	1
to	1
stand	1
on	1
rewards	1
which	1
either	1
come	1
late,	1
or	1
ill,	1
or	1
never	1
at	1
all;	1
God	1
help	1
me	1
with	1
my	1
own.	1
In	1
short,	1
I	1
would	1
like	1
to	1
know	1
what	1
I	1
am	1
to	1
get,	1
be	1
it	1
much	1
or	1
little;	1
for	1
the	1
hen	1
will	1
lay	1
on	1
one	1
egg,	1
and	1
many	1
littles	1
make	1
a	1
much,	1
and	1
so	1
long	1
as	1
one	1
gains	1
something	1
there	1
is	1
nothing	1
lost.	1
To	1
be	1
sure,	1
if	1
it	1
should	1
happen	1
(what	1
I	1
neither	1
believe	1
nor	1
expect)	1
that	1
your	1
worship	1
were	1
to	1
give	1
me	1
that	1
island	1
you	1
have	1
promised	1
me,	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
so	1
ungrateful	1
nor	1
so	1
grasping	1
but	1
that	1
I	1
would	1
be	1
willing	1
to	1
have	1
the	1
revenue	1
of	1
such	1
island	1
valued	1
and	1
stopped	1
out	1
of	1
my	1
wages	1
in	1
due	1
promotion.”	1
“Sancho,	1
my	1
friend,”	1
replied	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“sometimes	1
proportion	1
may	1
be	1
as	1
good	1
as	1
promotion.”	1
“I	1
see,”	1
said	1
Sancho;	1
“I’ll	1
bet	1
I	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
said	1
proportion,	1
and	1
not	1
promotion;	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
no	1
matter,	1
as	1
your	1
worship	1
has	1
understood	1
me.”	1
“And	1
so	1
well	1
understood,”	1
returned	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“that	1
I	1
have	1
seen	1
into	1
the	1
depths	1
of	1
thy	1
thoughts,	1
and	1
know	1
the	1
mark	1
thou	1
art	1
shooting	1
at	1
with	1
the	1
countless	1
shafts	1
of	1
thy	1
proverbs.	1
Look	1
here,	1
Sancho,	1
I	1
would	1
readily	1
fix	1
thy	1
wages	1
if	1
I	1
had	1
ever	1
found	1
any	1
instance	1
in	1
the	1
histories	1
of	1
the	1
knights-errant	1
to	1
show	1
or	1
indicate,	1
by	1
the	1
slightest	1
hint,	1
what	1
their	1
squires	1
used	1
to	1
get	1
monthly	1
or	1
yearly;	1
but	1
I	1
have	1
read	1
all	1
or	1
the	1
best	1
part	1
of	1
their	1
histories,	1
and	1
I	1
cannot	1
remember	1
reading	1
of	1
any	1
knight-errant	1
having	1
assigned	1
fixed	1
wages	1
to	1
his	1
squire;	1
I	1
only	1
know	1
that	1
they	1
all	1
served	1
on	1
reward,	1
and	1
that	1
when	1
they	1
least	1
expected	1
it,	1
if	1
good	1
luck	1
attended	1
their	1
masters,	1
they	1
found	1
themselves	1
recompensed	1
with	1
an	1
island	1
or	1
something	1
equivalent	1
to	1
it,	1
or	1
at	1
the	1
least	1
they	1
were	1
left	1
with	1
a	1
title	1
and	1
lordship.	1
If	1
with	1
these	1
hopes	1
and	1
additional	1
inducements	1
you,	1
Sancho,	1
please	1
to	1
return	1
to	1
my	1
service,	1
well	1
and	1
good;	1
but	1
to	1
suppose	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
going	1
to	1
disturb	1
or	1
unhinge	1
the	1
ancient	1
usage	1
of	1
knight-errantry,	1
is	1
all	1
nonsense.	1
And	1
so,	1
my	1
Sancho,	1
get	1
you	1
back	1
to	1
your	1
house	1
and	1
explain	1
my	1
intentions	1
to	1
your	1
Teresa,	1
and	1
if	1
she	1
likes	1
and	1
you	1
like	1
to	1
be	1
on	1
reward	1
with	1
me,	1
_bene	1
quidem;_	1
if	1
not,	1
we	1
remain	1
friends;	1
for	1
if	1
the	1
pigeon-house	1
does	1
not	1
lack	1
food,	1
it	1
will	1
not	1
lack	1
pigeons;	1
and	1
bear	1
in	1
mind,	1
my	1
son,	1
that	1
a	1
good	1
hope	1
is	1
better	1
than	1
a	1
bad	1
holding,	1
and	1
a	1
good	1
grievance	1
better	1
than	1
a	1
bad	1
compensation.	1
I	1
speak	1
in	1
this	1
way,	1
Sancho,	1
to	1
show	1
you	1
that	1
I	1
can	1
shower	1
down	1
proverbs	1
just	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
yourself;	1
and	1
in	1
short,	1
I	1
mean	1
to	1
say,	1
and	1
I	1
do	1
say,	1
that	1
if	1
you	1
don’t	1
like	1
to	1
come	1
on	1
reward	1
with	1
me,	1
and	1
run	1
the	1
same	1
chance	1
that	1
I	1
run,	1
God	1
be	1
with	1
you	1
and	1
make	1
a	1
saint	1
of	1
you;	1
for	1
I	1
shall	1
find	1
plenty	1
of	1
squires	1
more	1
obedient	1
and	1
painstaking,	1
and	1
not	1
so	1
thickheaded	1
or	1
talkative	1
as	1
you	1
are.”	1
When	1
Sancho	1
heard	1
his	1
master’s	1
firm,	1
resolute	1
language,	1
a	1
cloud	1
came	1
over	1
the	1
sky	1
with	1
him	1
and	1
the	1
wings	1
of	1
his	1
heart	1
drooped,	1
for	1
he	1
had	1
made	1
sure	1
that	1
his	1
master	1
would	1
not	1
go	1
without	1
him	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
wealth	1
of	1
the	1
world;	1
and	1
as	1
he	1
stood	1
there	1
dumbfoundered	1
and	1
moody,	1
Samson	1
Carrasco	1
came	1
in	1
with	1
the	1
housekeeper	1
and	1
niece,	1
who	1
were	1
anxious	1
to	1
hear	1
by	1
what	1
arguments	1
he	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
dissuade	1
their	1
master	1
from	1
going	1
to	1
seek	1
adventures.	1
The	1
arch	1
wag	1
Samson	1
came	1
forward,	1
and	1
embracing	1
him	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
before,	1
said	1
with	1
a	1
loud	1
voice,	1
“O	1
flower	1
of	1
knight-errantry!	1
O	1
shining	1
light	1
of	1
arms!	1
O	1
honour	1
and	1
mirror	1
of	1
the	1
Spanish	1
nation!	1
may	1
God	1
Almighty	1
in	1
his	1
infinite	1
power	1
grant	1
that	1
any	1
person	1
or	1
persons,	1
who	1
would	1
impede	1
or	1
hinder	1
thy	1
third	1
sally,	1
may	1
find	1
no	1
way	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
labyrinth	1
of	1
their	1
schemes,	1
nor	1
ever	1
accomplish	1
what	1
they	1
most	1
desire!”	1
And	1
then,	1
turning	1
to	1
the	1
housekeeper,	1
he	1
said,	1
“Mistress	1
housekeeper	1
may	1
just	1
as	1
well	1
give	1
over	1
saying	1
the	1
prayer	1
of	1
Santa	1
Apollonia,	1
for	1
I	1
know	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
positive	1
determination	1
of	1
the	1
spheres	1
that	1
Señor	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
shall	1
proceed	1
to	1
put	1
into	1
execution	1
his	1
new	1
and	1
lofty	1
designs;	1
and	1
I	1
should	1
lay	1
a	1
heavy	1
burden	1
on	1
my	1
conscience	1
did	1
I	1
not	1
urge	1
and	1
persuade	1
this	1
knight	1
not	1
to	1
keep	1
the	1
might	1
of	1
his	1
strong	1
arm	1
and	1
the	1
virtue	1
of	1
his	1
valiant	1
spirit	1
any	1
longer	1
curbed	1
and	1
checked,	1
for	1
by	1
his	1
inactivity	1
he	1
is	1
defrauding	1
the	1
world	1
of	1
the	1
redress	1
of	1
wrongs,	1
of	1
the	1
protection	1
of	1
orphans,	1
of	1
the	1
honour	1
of	1
virgins,	1
of	1
the	1
aid	1
of	1
widows,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
support	1
of	1
wives,	1
and	1
other	1
matters	1
of	1
this	1
kind	1
appertaining,	1
belonging,	1
proper	1
and	1
peculiar	1
to	1
the	1
order	1
of	1
knight-errantry.	1
On,	1
then,	1
my	1
lord	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
beautiful	1
and	1
brave,	1
let	1
your	1
worship	1
and	1
highness	1
set	1
out	1
to-day	1
rather	1
than	1
to-morrow;	1
and	1
if	1
anything	1
be	1
needed	1
for	1
the	1
execution	1
of	1
your	1
purpose,	1
here	1
am	1
I	1
ready	1
in	1
person	1
and	1
purse	1
to	1
supply	1
the	1
want;	1
and	1
were	1
it	1
requisite	1
to	1
attend	1
your	1
magnificence	1
as	1
squire,	1
I	1
should	1
esteem	1
it	1
the	1
happiest	1
good	1
fortune.”	1
At	1
this,	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
turning	1
to	1
Sancho,	1
said,	1
“Did	1
I	1
not	1
tell	1
thee,	1
Sancho,	1
there	1
would	1
be	1
squires	1
enough	1
and	1
to	1
spare	1
for	1
me?	1
See	1
now	1
who	1
offers	1
to	1
become	1
one;	1
no	1
less	1
than	1
the	1
illustrious	1
bachelor	1
Samson	1
Carrasco,	1
the	1
perpetual	1
joy	1
and	1
delight	1
of	1
the	1
courts	1
of	1
the	1
Salamancan	1
schools,	1
sound	1
in	1
body,	1
discreet,	1
patient	1
under	1
heat	1
or	1
cold,	1
hunger	1
or	1
thirst,	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
qualifications	1
requisite	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
knight-errant’s	1
squire!	1
But	1
heaven	1
forbid	1
that,	1
to	1
gratify	1
my	1
own	1
inclination,	1
I	1
should	1
shake	1
or	1
shatter	1
this	1
pillar	1
of	1
letters	1
and	1
vessel	1
of	1
the	1
sciences,	1
and	1
cut	1
down	1
this	1
towering	1
palm	1
of	1
the	1
fair	1
and	1
liberal	1
arts.	1
Let	1
this	1
new	1
Samson	1
remain	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
country,	1
and,	1
bringing	1
honour	1
to	1
it,	1
bring	1
honour	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
on	1
the	1
grey	1
heads	1
of	1
his	1
venerable	1
parents;	1
for	1
I	1
will	1
be	1
content	1
with	1
any	1
squire	1
that	1
comes	1
to	1
hand,	1
as	1
Sancho	1
does	1
not	1
deign	1
to	1
accompany	1
me.”	1
“I	1
do	1
deign,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
deeply	1
moved	1
and	1
with	1
tears	1
in	1
his	1
eyes;	1
“it	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
said	1
of	1
me,	1
master	1
mine,”	1
he	1
continued,	1
“‘the	1
bread	1
eaten	1
and	1
the	1
company	1
dispersed.’	1
Nay,	1
I	1
come	1
of	1
no	1
ungrateful	1
stock,	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
world	1
knows,	1
but	1
particularly	1
my	1
own	1
town,	1
who	1
the	1
Panzas	1
from	1
whom	1
I	1
am	1
descended	1
were;	1
and,	1
what	1
is	1
more,	1
I	1
know	1
and	1
have	1
learned,	1
by	1
many	1
good	1
words	1
and	1
deeds,	1
your	1
worship’s	1
desire	1
to	1
show	1
me	1
favour;	1
and	1
if	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
bargaining	1
more	1
or	1
less	1
about	1
my	1
wages,	1
it	1
was	1
only	1
to	1
please	1
my	1
wife,	1
who,	1
when	1
she	1
sets	1
herself	1
to	1
press	1
a	1
point,	1
no	1
hammer	1
drives	1
the	1
hoops	1
of	1
a	1
cask	1
as	1
she	1
drives	1
one	1
to	1
do	1
what	1
she	1
wants;	1
but,	1
after	1
all,	1
a	1
man	1
must	1
be	1
a	1
man,	1
and	1
a	1
woman	1
a	1
woman;	1
and	1
as	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
man	1
anyhow,	1
which	1
I	1
can’t	1
deny,	1
I	1
will	1
be	1
one	1
in	1
my	1
own	1
house	1
too,	1
let	1
who	1
will	1
take	1
it	1
amiss;	1
and	1
so	1
there’s	1
nothing	1
more	1
to	1
do	1
but	1
for	1
your	1
worship	1
to	1
make	1
your	1
will	1
with	1
its	1
codicil	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
way	1
that	1
it	1
can’t	1
be	1
provoked,	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
set	1
out	1
at	1
once,	1
to	1
save	1
Señor	1
Samson’s	1
soul	1
from	1
suffering,	1
as	1
he	1
says	1
his	1
conscience	1
obliges	1
him	1
to	1
persuade	1
your	1
worship	1
to	1
sally	1
out	1
upon	1
the	1
world	1
a	1
third	1
time;	1
so	1
I	1
offer	1
again	1
to	1
serve	1
your	1
worship	1
faithfully	1
and	1
loyally,	1
as	1
well	1
and	1
better	1
than	1
all	1
the	1
squires	1
that	1
served	1
knights-errant	1
in	1
times	1
past	1
or	1
present.”	1
The	1
bachelor	1
was	1
filled	1
with	1
amazement	1
when	1
he	1
heard	1
Sancho’s	1
phraseology	1
and	1
style	1
of	1
talk,	1
for	1
though	1
he	1
had	1
read	1
the	1
first	1
part	1
of	1
his	1
master’s	1
history	1
he	1
never	1
thought	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
be	1
so	1
droll	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
there	1
described;	1
but	1
now,	1
hearing	1
him	1
talk	1
of	1
a	1
“will	1
and	1
codicil	1
that	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
provoked,”	1
instead	1
of	1
“will	1
and	1
codicil	1
that	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
revoked,”	1
he	1
believed	1
all	1
he	1
had	1
read	1
of	1
him,	1
and	1
set	1
him	1
down	1
as	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
greatest	1
simpletons	1
of	1
modern	1
times;	1
and	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
himself	1
that	1
two	1
such	1
lunatics	1
as	1
master	1
and	1
man	1
the	1
world	1
had	1
never	1
seen.	1
In	1
fine,	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
and	1
Sancho	1
embraced	1
one	1
another	1
and	1
made	1
friends,	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
advice	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
approval	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
Carrasco,	1
who	1
was	1
now	1
their	1
oracle,	1
it	1
was	1
arranged	1
that	1
their	1
departure	1
should	1
take	1
place	1
three	1
days	1
thence,	1
by	1
which	1
time	1
they	1
could	1
have	1
all	1
that	1
was	1
requisite	1
for	1
the	1
journey	1
ready,	1
and	1
procure	1
a	1
closed	1
helmet,	1
which	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
said	1
he	1
must	1
by	1
all	1
means	1
take.	1
Samson	1
offered	1
him	1
one,	1
as	1
he	1
knew	1
a	1
friend	1
of	1
his	1
who	1
had	1
it	1
would	1
not	1
refuse	1
it	1
to	1
him,	1
though	1
it	1
was	1
more	1
dingy	1
with	1
rust	1
and	1
mildew	1
than	1
bright	1
and	1
clean	1
like	1
burnished	1
steel.	1
The	1
curses	1
which	1
both	1
housekeeper	1
and	1
niece	1
poured	1
out	1
on	1
the	1
bachelor	1
were	1
past	1
counting;	1
they	1
tore	1
their	1
hair,	1
they	1
clawed	1
their	1
faces,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
style	1
of	1
the	1
hired	1
mourners	1
that	1
were	1
once	1
in	1
fashion,	1
they	1
raised	1
a	1
lamentation	1
over	1
the	1
departure	1
of	1
their	1
master	1
and	1
uncle,	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
his	1
death.	1
Samson’s	1
intention	1
in	1
persuading	1
him	1
to	1
sally	1
forth	1
once	1
more	1
was	1
to	1
do	1
what	1
the	1
history	1
relates	1
farther	1
on;	1
all	1
by	1
the	1
advice	1
of	1
the	1
curate	1
and	1
barber,	1
with	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
previously	1
discussed	1
the	1
subject.	1
Finally,	1
then,	1
during	1
those	1
three	1
days,	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
and	1
Sancho	1
provided	1
themselves	1
with	1
what	1
they	1
considered	1
necessary,	1
and	1
Sancho	1
having	1
pacified	1
his	1
wife,	1
and	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
his	1
niece	1
and	1
housekeeper,	1
at	1
nightfall,	1
unseen	1
by	1
anyone	1
except	1
the	1
bachelor,	1
who	1
thought	1
fit	1
to	1
accompany	1
them	1
half	1
a	1
league	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
village,	1
they	1
set	1
out	1
for	1
El	1
Toboso,	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
on	1
his	1
good	1
Rocinante	1
and	1
Sancho	1
on	1
his	1
old	1
Dapple,	1
his	1
alforjas	1
furnished	1
with	1
certain	1
matters	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
victuals,	1
and	1
his	1
purse	1
with	1
money	1
that	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
gave	1
him	1
to	1
meet	1
emergencies.	1
Samson	1
embraced	1
him,	1
and	1
entreated	1
him	1
to	1
let	1
him	1
hear	1
of	1
his	1
good	1
or	1
evil	1
fortunes,	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
rejoice	1
over	1
the	1
former	1
or	1
condole	1
with	1
him	1
over	1
the	1
latter,	1
as	1
the	1
laws	1
of	1
friendship	1
required.	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
promised	1
him	1
he	1
would	1
do	1
so,	1
and	1
Samson	1
returned	1
to	1
the	1
village,	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
two	1
took	1
the	1
road	1
for	1
the	1
great	1
city	1
of	1
El	1
Toboso.	1

“Blessed	1
be	1
Allah	1
the	1
all-powerful!”	1
says	1
Hamete	1
Benengeli	1
on	1
beginning	1
this	1
eighth	1
chapter;	1
“blessed	1
be	1
Allah!”	1
he	1
repeats	1
three	1
times;	1
and	1
he	1
says	1
he	1
utters	1
these	1
thanksgivings	1
at	1
seeing	1
that	1
he	1
has	1
now	1
got	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
and	1
Sancho	1
fairly	1
afield,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
readers	1
of	1
his	1
delightful	1
history	1
may	1
reckon	1
that	1
the	1
achievements	1
and	1
humours	1
of	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
and	1
his	1
squire	1
are	1
now	1
about	1
to	1
begin;	1
and	1
he	1
urges	1
them	1
to	1
forget	1
the	1
former	1
chivalries	1
of	1
the	1
ingenious	1
gentleman	1
and	1
to	1
fix	1
their	1
eyes	1
on	1
those	1
that	1
are	1
to	1
come,	1
which	1
now	1
begin	1
on	1
the	1
road	1
to	1
El	1
Toboso,	1
as	1
the	1
others	1
began	1
on	1
the	1
plains	1
of	1
Montiel;	1
nor	1
is	1
it	1
much	1
that	1
he	1
asks	1
in	1
consideration	1
of	1
all	1
he	1
promises,	1
and	1
so	1
he	1
goes	1
on	1
to	1
say:	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
and	1
Sancho	1
were	1
left	1
alone,	1
and	1
the	1
moment	1
Samson	1
took	1
his	1
departure,	1
Rocinante	1
began	1
to	1
neigh,	1
and	1
Dapple	1
to	1
sigh,	1
which,	1
by	1
both	1
knight	1
and	1
squire,	1
was	1
accepted	1
as	1
a	1
good	1
sign	1
and	1
a	1
very	1
happy	1
omen;	1
though,	1
if	1
the	1
truth	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
told,	1
the	1
sighs	1
and	1
brays	1
of	1
Dapple	1
were	1
louder	1
than	1
the	1
neighings	1
of	1
the	1
hack,	1
from	1
which	1
Sancho	1
inferred	1
that	1
his	1
good	1
fortune	1
was	1
to	1
exceed	1
and	1
overtop	1
that	1
of	1
his	1
master,	1
building,	1
perhaps,	1
upon	1
some	1
judicial	1
astrology	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
have	1
known,	1
though	1
the	1
history	1
says	1
nothing	1
about	1
it;	1
all	1
that	1
can	1
be	1
said	1
is,	1
that	1
when	1
he	1
stumbled	1
or	1
fell,	1
he	1
was	1
heard	1
to	1
say	1
he	1
wished	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
come	1
out,	1
for	1
by	1
stumbling	1
or	1
falling	1
there	1
was	1
nothing	1
to	1
be	1
got	1
but	1
a	1
damaged	1
shoe	1
or	1
a	1
broken	1
rib;	1
and,	1
fool	1
as	1
he	1
was,	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
much	1
astray	1
in	1
this.	1
Said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“Sancho,	1
my	1
friend,	1
night	1
is	1
drawing	1
on	1
upon	1
us	1
as	1
we	1
go,	1
and	1
more	1
darkly	1
than	1
will	1
allow	1
us	1
to	1
reach	1
El	1
Toboso	1
by	1
daylight;	1
for	1
there	1
I	1
am	1
resolved	1
to	1
go	1
before	1
I	1
engage	1
in	1
another	1
adventure,	1
and	1
there	1
I	1
shall	1
obtain	1
the	1
blessing	1
and	1
generous	1
permission	1
of	1
the	1
peerless	1
Dulcinea,	1
with	1
which	1
permission	1
I	1
expect	1
and	1
feel	1
assured	1
that	1
I	1
shall	1
conclude	1
and	1
bring	1
to	1
a	1
happy	1
termination	1
every	1
perilous	1
adventure;	1
for	1
nothing	1
in	1
life	1
makes	1
knights-errant	1
more	1
valorous	1
than	1
finding	1
themselves	1
favoured	1
by	1
their	1
ladies.”	1

“So	1
I	1
believe,”	1
replied	1
Sancho;	1
“but	1
I	1
think	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
difficult	1
for	1
your	1
worship	1
to	1
speak	1
with	1
her	1
or	1
see	1
her,	1
at	1
any	1
rate	1
where	1
you	1
will	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
receive	1
her	1
blessing;	1
unless,	1
indeed,	1
she	1
throws	1
it	1
over	1
the	1
wall	1
of	1
the	1
yard	1
where	1
I	1
saw	1
her	1
the	1
time	1
before,	1
when	1
I	1
took	1
her	1
the	1
letter	1
that	1
told	1
of	1
the	1
follies	1
and	1
mad	1
things	1
your	1
worship	1
was	1
doing	1
in	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
Sierra	1
Morena.”	1
“Didst	1
thou	1
take	1
that	1
for	1
a	1
yard	1
wall,	1
Sancho,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“where	1
or	1
at	1
which	1
thou	1
sawest	1
that	1
never	1
sufficiently	1
extolled	1
grace	1
and	1
beauty?	1
It	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
the	1
gallery,	1
corridor,	1
or	1
portico	1
of	1
some	1
rich	1
and	1
royal	1
palace.”	1
“It	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
all	1
that,”	1
returned	1
Sancho,	1
“but	1
to	1
me	1
it	1
looked	1
like	1
a	1
wall,	1
unless	1
I	1
am	1
short	1
of	1
memory.”	1
“At	1
all	1
events,	1
let	1
us	1
go	1
there,	1
Sancho,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
“for,	1
so	1
that	1
I	1
see	1
her,	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
same	1
to	1
me	1
whether	1
it	1
be	1
over	1
a	1
wall,	1
or	1
at	1
a	1
window,	1
or	1
through	1
the	1
chink	1
of	1
a	1
door,	1
or	1
the	1
grate	1
of	1
a	1
garden;	1
for	1
any	1
beam	1
of	1
the	1
sun	1
of	1
her	1
beauty	1
that	1
reaches	1
my	1
eyes	1
will	1
give	1
light	1
to	1
my	1
reason	1
and	1
strength	1
to	1
my	1
heart,	1
so	1
that	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
unmatched	1
and	1
unequalled	1
in	1
wisdom	1
and	1
valour.”	1
“Well,	1
to	1
tell	1
the	1
truth,	1
señor,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“when	1
I	1
saw	1
that	1
sun	1
of	1
the	1
lady	1
Dulcinea	1
del	1
Toboso,	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
bright	1
enough	1
to	1
throw	1
out	1
beams	1
at	1
all;	1
it	1
must	1
have	1
been,	1
that	1
as	1
her	1
grace	1
was	1
sifting	1
that	1
wheat	1
I	1
told	1
you	1
of,	1
the	1
thick	1
dust	1
she	1
raised	1
came	1
before	1
her	1
face	1
like	1
a	1
cloud	1
and	1
dimmed	1
it.”	1
“What!	1
dost	1
thou	1
still	1
persist,	1
Sancho,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“in	1
saying,	1
thinking,	1
believing,	1
and	1
maintaining	1
that	1
my	1
lady	1
Dulcinea	1
was	1
sifting	1
wheat,	1
that	1
being	1
an	1
occupation	1
and	1
task	1
entirely	1
at	1
variance	1
with	1
what	1
is	1
and	1
should	1
be	1
the	1
employment	1
of	1
persons	1
of	1
distinction,	1
who	1
are	1
constituted	1
and	1
reserved	1
for	1
other	1
avocations	1
and	1
pursuits	1
that	1
show	1
their	1
rank	1
a	1
bowshot	1
off?	1
Thou	1
hast	1
forgotten,	1
O	1
Sancho,	1
those	1
lines	1
of	1
our	1
poet	1
wherein	1
he	1
paints	1
for	1
us	1
how,	1
in	1
their	1
crystal	1
abodes,	1
those	1
four	1
nymphs	1
employed	1
themselves	1
who	1
rose	1
from	1
their	1
loved	1
Tagus	1
and	1
seated	1
themselves	1
in	1
a	1
verdant	1
meadow	1
to	1
embroider	1
those	1
tissues	1
which	1
the	1
ingenious	1
poet	1
there	1
describes	1
to	1
us,	1
how	1
they	1
were	1
worked	1
and	1
woven	1
with	1
gold	1
and	1
silk	1
and	1
pearls;	1
and	1
something	1
of	1
this	1
sort	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
the	1
employment	1
of	1
my	1
lady	1
when	1
thou	1
sawest	1
her,	1
only	1
that	1
the	1
spite	1
which	1
some	1
wicked	1
enchanter	1
seems	1
to	1
have	1
against	1
everything	1
of	1
mine	1
changes	1
all	1
those	1
things	1
that	1
give	1
me	1
pleasure,	1
and	1
turns	1
them	1
into	1
shapes	1
unlike	1
their	1
own;	1
and	1
so	1
I	1
fear	1
that	1
in	1
that	1
history	1
of	1
my	1
achievements	1
which	1
they	1
say	1
is	1
now	1
in	1
print,	1
if	1
haply	1
its	1
author	1
was	1
some	1
sage	1
who	1
is	1
an	1
enemy	1
of	1
mine,	1
he	1
will	1
have	1
put	1
one	1
thing	1
for	1
another,	1
mingling	1
a	1
thousand	1
lies	1
with	1
one	1
truth,	1
and	1
amusing	1
himself	1
by	1
relating	1
transactions	1
which	1
have	1
nothing	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
the	1
sequence	1
of	1
a	1
true	1
history.	1
O	1
envy,	1
root	1
of	1
all	1
countless	1
evils,	1
and	1
cankerworm	1
of	1
the	1
virtues!	1
All	1
the	1
vices,	1
Sancho,	1
bring	1
some	1
kind	1
of	1
pleasure	1
with	1
them;	1
but	1
envy	1
brings	1
nothing	1
but	1
irritation,	1
bitterness,	1
and	1
rage.”	1
“So	1
I	1
say	1
too,”	1
replied	1
Sancho;	1
“and	1
I	1
suspect	1
in	1
that	1
legend	1
or	1
history	1
of	1
us	1
that	1
the	1
bachelor	1
Samson	1
Carrasco	1
told	1
us	1
he	1
saw,	1
my	1
honour	1
goes	1
dragged	1
in	1
the	1
dirt,	1
knocked	1
about,	1
up	1
and	1
down,	1
sweeping	1
the	1
streets,	1
as	1
they	1
say.	1
And	1
yet,	1
on	1
the	1
faith	1
of	1
an	1
honest	1
man,	1
I	1
never	1
spoke	1
ill	1
of	1
any	1
enchanter,	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
so	1
well	1
off	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
to	1
be	1
envied;	1
to	1
be	1
sure,	1
I	1
am	1
rather	1
sly,	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
a	1
certain	1
spice	1
of	1
the	1
rogue	1
in	1
me;	1
but	1
all	1
is	1
covered	1
by	1
the	1
great	1
cloak	1
of	1
my	1
simplicity,	1
always	1
natural	1
and	1
never	1
acted;	1
and	1
if	1
I	1
had	1
no	1
other	1
merit	1
save	1
that	1
I	1
believe,	1
as	1
I	1
always	1
do,	1
firmly	1
and	1
truly	1
in	1
God,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
holy	1
Roman	1
Catholic	1
Church	1
holds	1
and	1
believes,	1
and	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
mortal	1
enemy	1
of	1
the	1
Jews,	1
the	1
historians	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
mercy	1
on	1
me	1
and	1
treat	1
me	1
well	1
in	1
their	1
writings.	1
But	1
let	1
them	1
say	1
what	1
they	1
like;	1
naked	1
was	1
I	1
born,	1
naked	1
I	1
find	1
myself,	1
I	1
neither	1
lose	1
nor	1
gain;	1
nay,	1
while	1
I	1
see	1
myself	1
put	1
into	1
a	1
book	1
and	1
passed	1
on	1
from	1
hand	1
to	1
hand	1
over	1
the	1
world,	1
I	1
don’t	1
care	1
a	1
fig,	1
let	1
them	1
say	1
what	1
they	1
like	1
of	1
me.”	1
“That,	1
Sancho,”	1
returned	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“reminds	1
me	1
of	1
what	1
happened	1
to	1
a	1
famous	1
poet	1
of	1
our	1
own	1
day,	1
who,	1
having	1
written	1
a	1
bitter	1
satire	1
against	1
all	1
the	1
courtesan	1
ladies,	1
did	1
not	1
insert	1
or	1
name	1
in	1
it	1
a	1
certain	1
lady	1
of	1
whom	1
it	1
was	1
questionable	1
whether	1
she	1
was	1
one	1
or	1
not.	1
She,	1
seeing	1
she	1
was	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
list	1
of	1
the	1
poet,	1
asked	1
him	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
seen	1
in	1
her	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
include	1
her	1
in	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
the	1
others,	1
telling	1
him	1
he	1
must	1
add	1
to	1
his	1
satire	1
and	1
put	1
her	1
in	1
the	1
new	1
part,	1
or	1
else	1
look	1
out	1
for	1
the	1
consequences.	1
The	1
poet	1
did	1
as	1
she	1
bade	1
him,	1
and	1
left	1
her	1
without	1
a	1
shred	1
of	1
reputation,	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
satisfied	1
by	1
getting	1
fame	1
though	1
it	1
was	1
infamy.	1
In	1
keeping	1
with	1
this	1
is	1
what	1
they	1
relate	1
of	1
that	1
shepherd	1
who	1
set	1
fire	1
to	1
the	1
famous	1
temple	1
of	1
Diana,	1
by	1
repute	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
seven	1
wonders	1
of	1
the	1
world,	1
and	1
burned	1
it	1
with	1
the	1
sole	1
object	1
of	1
making	1
his	1
name	1
live	1
in	1
after	1
ages;	1
and,	1
though	1
it	1
was	1
forbidden	1
to	1
name	1
him,	1
or	1
mention	1
his	1
name	1
by	1
word	1
of	1
mouth	1
or	1
in	1
writing,	1
lest	1
the	1
object	1
of	1
his	1
ambition	1
should	1
be	1
attained,	1
nevertheless	1
it	1
became	1
known	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
called	1
Erostratus.	1
And	1
something	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
sort	1
is	1
what	1
happened	1
in	1
the	1
case	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
emperor	1
Charles	1
V.	1
and	1
a	1
gentleman	1
in	1
Rome.	1
The	1
emperor	1
was	1
anxious	1
to	1
see	1
that	1
famous	1
temple	1
of	1
the	1
Rotunda,	1
called	1
in	1
ancient	1
times	1
the	1
temple	1
‘of	1
all	1
the	1
gods,’	1
but	1
now-a-days,	1
by	1
a	1
better	1
nomenclature,	1
‘of	1
all	1
the	1
saints,’	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
best	1
preserved	1
building	1
of	1
all	1
those	1
of	1
pagan	1
construction	1
in	1
Rome,	1
and	1
the	1
one	1
which	1
best	1
sustains	1
the	1
reputation	1
of	1
mighty	1
works	1
and	1
magnificence	1
of	1
its	1
founders.	1
It	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
form	1
of	1
a	1
half	1
orange,	1
of	1
enormous	1
dimensions,	1
and	1
well	1
lighted,	1
though	1
no	1
light	1
penetrates	1
it	1
save	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
admitted	1
by	1
a	1
window,	1
or	1
rather	1
round	1
skylight,	1
at	1
the	1
top;	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
from	1
this	1
that	1
the	1
emperor	1
examined	1
the	1
building.	1
A	1
Roman	1
gentleman	1
stood	1
by	1
his	1
side	1
and	1
explained	1
to	1
him	1
the	1
skilful	1
construction	1
and	1
ingenuity	1
of	1
the	1
vast	1
fabric	1
and	1
its	1
wonderful	1
architecture,	1
and	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
left	1
the	1
skylight	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
emperor,	1
‘A	1
thousand	1
times,	1
your	1
Sacred	1
Majesty,	1
the	1
impulse	1
came	1
upon	1
me	1
to	1
seize	1
your	1
Majesty	1
in	1
my	1
arms	1
and	1
fling	1
myself	1
down	1
from	1
yonder	1
skylight,	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
leave	1
behind	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
a	1
name	1
that	1
would	1
last	1
for	1
ever.’	1
‘I	1
am	1
thankful	1
to	1
you	1
for	1
not	1
carrying	1
such	1
an	1
evil	1
thought	1
into	1
effect,’	1
said	1
the	1
emperor,	1
‘and	1
I	1
shall	1
give	1
you	1
no	1
opportunity	1
in	1
future	1
of	1
again	1
putting	1
your	1
loyalty	1
to	1
the	1
test;	1
and	1
I	1
therefore	1
forbid	1
you	1
ever	1
to	1
speak	1
to	1
me	1
or	1
to	1
be	1
where	1
I	1
am;	1
and	1
he	1
followed	1
up	1
these	1
words	1
by	1
bestowing	1
a	1
liberal	1
bounty	1
upon	1
him.	1
My	1
meaning	1
is,	1
Sancho,	1
that	1
the	1
desire	1
of	1
acquiring	1
fame	1
is	1
a	1
very	1
powerful	1
motive.	1
What,	1
thinkest	1
thou,	1
was	1
it	1
that	1
flung	1
Horatius	1
in	1
full	1
armour	1
down	1
from	1
the	1
bridge	1
into	1
the	1
depths	1
of	1
the	1
Tiber?	1
What	1
burned	1
the	1
hand	1
and	1
arm	1
of	1
Mutius?	1
What	1
impelled	1
Curtius	1
to	1
plunge	1
into	1
the	1
deep	1
burning	1
gulf	1
that	1
opened	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
Rome?	1
What,	1
in	1
opposition	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
omens	1
that	1
declared	1
against	1
him,	1
made	1
Julius	1
Cæsar	1
cross	1
the	1
Rubicon?	1
And	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
more	1
modern	1
examples,	1
what	1
scuttled	1
the	1
ships,	1
and	1
left	1
stranded	1
and	1
cut	1
off	1
the	1
gallant	1
Spaniards	1
under	1
the	1
command	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
courteous	1
Cortés	1
in	1
the	1
New	1
World?	1
All	1
these	1
and	1
a	1
variety	1
of	1
other	1
great	1
exploits	1
are,	1
were	1
and	1
will	1
be,	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
fame	1
that	1
mortals	1
desire	1
as	1
a	1
reward	1
and	1
a	1
portion	1
of	1
the	1
immortality	1
their	1
famous	1
deeds	1
deserve;	1
though	1
we	1
Catholic	1
Christians	1
and	1
knights-errant	1
look	1
more	1
to	1
that	1
future	1
glory	1
that	1
is	1
everlasting	1
in	1
the	1
ethereal	1
regions	1
of	1
heaven	1
than	1
to	1
the	1
vanity	1
of	1
the	1
fame	1
that	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
acquired	1
in	1
this	1
present	1
transitory	1
life;	1
a	1
fame	1
that,	1
however	1
long	1
it	1
may	1
last,	1
must	1
after	1
all	1
end	1
with	1
the	1
world	1
itself,	1
which	1
has	1
its	1
own	1
appointed	1
end.	1
So	1
that,	1
O	1
Sancho,	1
in	1
what	1
we	1
do	1
we	1
must	1
not	1
overpass	1
the	1
bounds	1
which	1
the	1
Christian	1
religion	1
we	1
profess	1
has	1
assigned	1
to	1
us.	1
We	1
have	1
to	1
slay	1
pride	1
in	1
giants,	1
envy	1
by	1
generosity	1
and	1
nobleness	1
of	1
heart,	1
anger	1
by	1
calmness	1
of	1
demeanour	1
and	1
equanimity,	1
gluttony	1
and	1
sloth	1
by	1
the	1
spareness	1
of	1
our	1
diet	1
and	1
the	1
length	1
of	1
our	1
vigils,	1
lust	1
and	1
lewdness	1
by	1
the	1
loyalty	1
we	1
preserve	1
to	1
those	1
whom	1
we	1
have	1
made	1
the	1
mistresses	1
of	1
our	1
thoughts,	1
indolence	1
by	1
traversing	1
the	1
world	1
in	1
all	1
directions	1
seeking	1
opportunities	1
of	1
making	1
ourselves,	1
besides	1
Christians,	1
famous	1
knights.	1
Such,	1
Sancho,	1
are	1
the	1
means	1
by	1
which	1
we	1
reach	1
those	1
extremes	1
of	1
praise	1
that	1
fair	1
fame	1
carries	1
with	1
it.”	1
“All	1
that	1
your	1
worship	1
has	1
said	1
so	1
far,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“I	1
have	1
understood	1
quite	1
well;	1
but	1
still	1
I	1
would	1
be	1
glad	1
if	1
your	1
worship	1
would	1
dissolve	1
a	1
doubt	1
for	1
me,	1
which	1
has	1
just	1
this	1
minute	1
come	1
into	1
my	1
mind.”	1
“Solve,	1
thou	1
meanest,	1
Sancho,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
“say	1
on,	1
in	1
God’s	1
name,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
answer	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
I	1
can.”	1
“Tell	1
me,	1
señor,”	1
Sancho	1
went	1
on	1
to	1
say,	1
“those	1
Julys	1
or	1
Augusts,	1
and	1
all	1
those	1
venturous	1
knights	1
that	1
you	1
say	1
are	1
now	1
dead—where	1
are	1
they	1
now?”	1
“The	1
heathens,”	1
replied	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“are,	1
no	1
doubt,	1
in	1
hell;	1
the	1
Christians,	1
if	1
they	1
were	1
good	1
Christians,	1
are	1
either	1
in	1
purgatory	1
or	1
in	1
heaven.”	1
“Very	1
good,”	1
said	1
Sancho;	1
“but	1
now	1
I	1
want	1
to	1
know—the	1
tombs	1
where	1
the	1
bodies	1
of	1
those	1
great	1
lords	1
are,	1
have	1
they	1
silver	1
lamps	1
before	1
them,	1
or	1
are	1
the	1
walls	1
of	1
their	1
chapels	1
ornamented	1
with	1
crutches,	1
winding-sheets,	1
tresses	1
of	1
hair,	1
legs	1
and	1
eyes	1
in	1
wax?	1
Or	1
what	1
are	1
they	1
ornamented	1
with?”	1
To	1
which	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
made	1
answer:	1
“The	1
tombs	1
of	1
the	1
heathens	1
were	1
generally	1
sumptuous	1
temples;	1
the	1
ashes	1
of	1
Julius	1
Cæsar’s	1
body	1
were	1
placed	1
on	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
a	1
stone	1
pyramid	1
of	1
vast	1
size,	1
which	1
they	1
now	1
call	1
in	1
Rome	1
Saint	1
Peter’s	1
needle.	1
The	1
emperor	1
Hadrian	1
had	1
for	1
a	1
tomb	1
a	1
castle	1
as	1
large	1
as	1
a	1
good-sized	1
village,	1
which	1
they	1
called	1
the	1
_Moles	1
Adriani_,	1
and	1
is	1
now	1
the	1
castle	1
of	1
St.	1
Angelo	1
in	1
Rome.	1
The	1
queen	1
Artemisia	1
buried	1
her	1
husband	1
Mausolus	1
in	1
a	1
tomb	1
which	1
was	1
reckoned	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
seven	1
wonders	1
of	1
the	1
world;	1
but	1
none	1
of	1
these	1
tombs,	1
or	1
of	1
the	1
many	1
others	1
of	1
the	1
heathens,	1
were	1
ornamented	1
with	1
winding-sheets	1
or	1
any	1
of	1
those	1
other	1
offerings	1
and	1
tokens	1
that	1
show	1
that	1
they	1
who	1
are	1
buried	1
there	1
are	1
saints.”	1
“That’s	1
the	1
point	1
I’m	1
coming	1
to,”	1
said	1
Sancho;	1
“and	1
now	1
tell	1
me,	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
greater	1
work,	1
to	1
bring	1
a	1
dead	1
man	1
to	1
life	1
or	1
to	1
kill	1
a	1
giant?”	1
“The	1
answer	1
is	1
easy,”	1
replied	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
“it	1
is	1
a	1
greater	1
work	1
to	1
bring	1
to	1
life	1
a	1
dead	1
man.”	1
“Now	1
I	1
have	1
got	1
you,”	1
said	1
Sancho;	1
“in	1
that	1
case	1
the	1
fame	1
of	1
them	1
who	1
bring	1
the	1
dead	1
to	1
life,	1
who	1
give	1
sight	1
to	1
the	1
blind,	1
cure	1
cripples,	1
restore	1
health	1
to	1
the	1
sick,	1
and	1
before	1
whose	1
tombs	1
there	1
are	1
lamps	1
burning,	1
and	1
whose	1
chapels	1
are	1
filled	1
with	1
devout	1
folk	1
on	1
their	1
knees	1
adoring	1
their	1
relics	1
be	1
a	1
better	1
fame	1
in	1
this	1
life	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
other	1
than	1
that	1
which	1
all	1
the	1
heathen	1
emperors	1
and	1
knights-errant	1
that	1
have	1
ever	1
been	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
have	1
left	1
or	1
may	1
leave	1
behind	1
them?”	1
“That	1
I	1
grant,	1
too,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote.	1
“Then	1
this	1
fame,	1
these	1
favours,	1
these	1
privileges,	1
or	1
whatever	1
you	1
call	1
it,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“belong	1
to	1
the	1
bodies	1
and	1
relics	1
of	1
the	1
saints	1
who,	1
with	1
the	1
approbation	1
and	1
permission	1
of	1
our	1
holy	1
mother	1
Church,	1
have	1
lamps,	1
tapers,	1
winding-sheets,	1
crutches,	1
pictures,	1
eyes	1
and	1
legs,	1
by	1
means	1
of	1
which	1
they	1
increase	1
devotion	1
and	1
add	1
to	1
their	1
own	1
Christian	1
reputation.	1
Kings	1
carry	1
the	1
bodies	1
or	1
relics	1
of	1
saints	1
on	1
their	1
shoulders,	1
and	1
kiss	1
bits	1
of	1
their	1
bones,	1
and	1
enrich	1
and	1
adorn	1
their	1
oratories	1
and	1
favourite	1
altars	1
with	1
them.”	1
“What	1
wouldst	1
thou	1
have	1
me	1
infer	1
from	1
all	1
thou	1
hast	1
said,	1
Sancho?”	1
asked	1
Don	1
Quixote.	1
“My	1
meaning	1
is,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“let	1
us	1
set	1
about	1
becoming	1
saints,	1
and	1
we	1
shall	1
obtain	1
more	1
quickly	1
the	1
fair	1
fame	1
we	1
are	1
striving	1
after;	1
for	1
you	1
know,	1
señor,	1
yesterday	1
or	1
the	1
day	1
before	1
yesterday	1
(for	1
it	1
is	1
so	1
lately	1
one	1
may	1
say	1
so)	1
they	1
canonised	1
and	1
beatified	1
two	1
little	1
barefoot	1
friars,	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
now	1
reckoned	1
the	1
greatest	1
good	1
luck	1
to	1
kiss	1
or	1
touch	1
the	1
iron	1
chains	1
with	1
which	1
they	1
girt	1
and	1
tortured	1
their	1
bodies,	1
and	1
they	1
are	1
held	1
in	1
greater	1
veneration,	1
so	1
it	1
is	1
said,	1
than	1
the	1
sword	1
of	1
Roland	1
in	1
the	1
armoury	1
of	1
our	1
lord	1
the	1
King,	1
whom	1
God	1
preserve.	1
So	1
that,	1
señor,	1
it	1
is	1
better	1
to	1
be	1
an	1
humble	1
little	1
friar	1
of	1
no	1
matter	1
what	1
order,	1
than	1
a	1
valiant	1
knight-errant;	1
with	1
God	1
a	1
couple	1
of	1
dozen	1
of	1
penance	1
lashings	1
are	1
of	1
more	1
avail	1
than	1
two	1
thousand	1
lance-thrusts,	1
be	1
they	1
given	1
to	1
giants,	1
or	1
monsters,	1
or	1
dragons.”	1
“All	1
that	1
is	1
true,”	1
returned	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“but	1
we	1
cannot	1
all	1
be	1
friars,	1
and	1
many	1
are	1
the	1
ways	1
by	1
which	1
God	1
takes	1
his	1
own	1
to	1
heaven;	1
chivalry	1
is	1
a	1
religion,	1
there	1
are	1
sainted	1
knights	1
in	1
glory.”	1
“Yes,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“but	1
I	1
have	1
heard	1
say	1
that	1
there	1
are	1
more	1
friars	1
in	1
heaven	1
than	1
knights-errant.”	1
“That,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“is	1
because	1
those	1
in	1
religious	1
orders	1
are	1
more	1
numerous	1
than	1
knights.”	1
“The	1
errants	1
are	1
many,”	1
said	1
Sancho.	1
“Many,”	1
replied	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“but	1
few	1
they	1
who	1
deserve	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
knights.”	1
With	1
these,	1
and	1
other	1
discussions	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
sort,	1
they	1
passed	1
that	1
night	1
and	1
the	1
following	1
day,	1
without	1
anything	1
worth	1
mention	1
happening	1
to	1
them,	1
whereat	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
little	1
dejected;	1
but	1
at	1
length	1
the	1
next	1
day,	1
at	1
daybreak,	1
they	1
descried	1
the	1
great	1
city	1
of	1
El	1
Toboso,	1
at	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
which	1
Don	1
Quixote’s	1
spirits	1
rose	1
and	1
Sancho’s	1
fell,	1
for	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
Dulcinea’s	1
house,	1
nor	1
in	1
all	1
his	1
life	1
had	1
he	1
ever	1
seen	1
her,	1
any	1
more	1
than	1
his	1
master;	1
so	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
both	1
uneasy,	1
the	1
one	1
to	1
see	1
her,	1
the	1
other	1
at	1
not	1
having	1
seen	1
her,	1
and	1
Sancho	1
was	1
at	1
a	1
loss	1
to	1
know	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
to	1
do	1
when	1
his	1
master	1
sent	1
him	1
to	1
El	1
Toboso.	1
In	1
the	1
end,	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
made	1
up	1
his	1
mind	1
to	1
enter	1
the	1
city	1
at	1
nightfall,	1
and	1
they	1
waited	1
until	1
the	1
time	1
came	1
among	1
some	1
oak	1
trees	1
that	1
were	1
near	1
El	1
Toboso;	1
and	1
when	1
the	1
moment	1
they	1
had	1
agreed	1
upon	1
arrived,	1
they	1
made	1
their	1
entrance	1
into	1
the	1
city,	1
where	1
something	1
happened	1
them	1
that	1
may	1
fairly	1
be	1
called	1
something.	1

Don	1
Quixote	1
and	1
Sancho	1
quitted	1
the	1
wood	1
and	1
entered	1
El	1
Toboso.	1
The	1
town	1
was	1
in	1
deep	1
silence,	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
were	1
asleep,	1
and	1
stretched	1
on	1
the	1
broad	1
of	1
their	1
backs,	1
as	1
the	1
saying	1
is.	1
The	1
night	1
was	1
darkish,	1
though	1
Sancho	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
glad	1
had	1
it	1
been	1
quite	1
dark,	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
find	1
in	1
the	1
darkness	1
an	1
excuse	1
for	1
his	1
blundering.	1
All	1
over	1
the	1
place	1
nothing	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
heard	1
except	1
the	1
barking	1
of	1
dogs,	1
which	1
deafened	1
the	1
ears	1
of	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
and	1
troubled	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
Sancho.	1
Now	1
and	1
then	1
an	1
ass	1
brayed,	1
pigs	1
grunted,	1
cats	1
mewed,	1
and	1
the	1
various	1
noises	1
they	1
made	1
seemed	1
louder	1
in	1
the	1
silence	1
of	1
the	1
night;	1
all	1
which	1
the	1
enamoured	1
knight	1
took	1
to	1
be	1
of	1
evil	1
omen;	1
nevertheless	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
Sancho,	1
“Sancho,	1
my	1
son,	1
lead	1
on	1
to	1
the	1
palace	1
of	1
Dulcinea,	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
that	1
we	1
shall	1
find	1
her	1
awake.”	1
“Body	1
of	1
the	1
sun!	1
what	1
palace	1
am	1
I	1
to	1
lead	1
to,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“when	1
what	1
I	1
saw	1
her	1
highness	1
in	1
was	1
only	1
a	1
very	1
little	1
house?”	1
“Most	1
likely	1
she	1
had	1
then	1
withdrawn	1
into	1
some	1
small	1
apartment	1
of	1
her	1
palace,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“to	1
amuse	1
herself	1
with	1
damsels,	1
as	1
great	1
ladies	1
and	1
princesses	1
are	1
accustomed	1
to	1
do.”	1
“Señor,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“if	1
your	1
worship	1
will	1
have	1
it	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
me	1
that	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
my	1
lady	1
Dulcinea	1
is	1
a	1
palace,	1
is	1
this	1
an	1
hour,	1
think	1
you,	1
to	1
find	1
the	1
door	1
open;	1
and	1
will	1
it	1
be	1
right	1
for	1
us	1
to	1
go	1
knocking	1
till	1
they	1
hear	1
us	1
and	1
open	1
the	1
door;	1
making	1
a	1
disturbance	1
and	1
confusion	1
all	1
through	1
the	1
household?	1
Are	1
we	1
going,	1
do	1
you	1
fancy,	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
our	1
wenches,	1
like	1
gallants	1
who	1
come	1
and	1
knock	1
and	1
go	1
in	1
at	1
any	1
hour,	1
however	1
late	1
it	1
may	1
be?”	1
“Let	1
us	1
first	1
of	1
all	1
find	1
out	1
the	1
palace	1
for	1
certain,”	1
replied	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“and	1
then	1
I	1
will	1
tell	1
thee,	1
Sancho,	1
what	1
we	1
had	1
best	1
do;	1
but	1
look,	1
Sancho,	1
for	1
either	1
I	1
see	1
badly,	1
or	1
that	1
dark	1
mass	1
that	1
one	1
sees	1
from	1
here	1
should	1
be	1
Dulcinea’s	1
palace.”	1
“Then	1
let	1
your	1
worship	1
lead	1
the	1
way,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“perhaps	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
so;	1
though	1
I	1
see	1
it	1
with	1
my	1
eyes	1
and	1
touch	1
it	1
with	1
my	1
hands,	1
I’ll	1
believe	1
it	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
I	1
believe	1
it	1
is	1
daylight	1
now.”	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
took	1
the	1
lead,	1
and	1
having	1
gone	1
a	1
matter	1
of	1
two	1
hundred	1
paces	1
he	1
came	1
upon	1
the	1
mass	1
that	1
produced	1
the	1
shade,	1
and	1
found	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
great	1
tower,	1
and	1
then	1
he	1
perceived	1
that	1
the	1
building	1
in	1
question	1
was	1
no	1
palace,	1
but	1
the	1
chief	1
church	1
of	1
the	1
town,	1
and	1
said	1
he,	1
“It’s	1
the	1
church	1
we	1
have	1
lit	1
upon,	1
Sancho.”	1
“So	1
I	1
see,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“and	1
God	1
grant	1
we	1
may	1
not	1
light	1
upon	1
our	1
graves;	1
it	1
is	1
no	1
good	1
sign	1
to	1
find	1
oneself	1
wandering	1
in	1
a	1
graveyard	1
at	1
this	1
time	1
of	1
night;	1
and	1
that,	1
after	1
my	1
telling	1
your	1
worship,	1
if	1
I	1
don’t	1
mistake,	1
that	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
this	1
lady	1
will	1
be	1
in	1
an	1
alley	1
without	1
an	1
outlet.”	1
“The	1
curse	1
of	1
God	1
on	1
thee	1
for	1
a	1
blockhead!”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
“where	1
hast	1
thou	1
ever	1
heard	1
of	1
castles	1
and	1
royal	1
palaces	1
being	1
built	1
in	1
alleys	1
without	1
an	1
outlet?”	1
“Señor,”	1
replied	1
Sancho,	1
“every	1
country	1
has	1
a	1
way	1
of	1
its	1
own;	1
perhaps	1
here	1
in	1
El	1
Toboso	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
way	1
to	1
build	1
palaces	1
and	1
grand	1
buildings	1
in	1
alleys;	1
so	1
I	1
entreat	1
your	1
worship	1
to	1
let	1
me	1
search	1
about	1
among	1
these	1
streets	1
or	1
alleys	1
before	1
me,	1
and	1
perhaps,	1
in	1
some	1
corner	1
or	1
other,	1
I	1
may	1
stumble	1
on	1
this	1
palace—and	1
I	1
wish	1
I	1
saw	1
the	1
dogs	1
eating	1
it	1
for	1
leading	1
us	1
such	1
a	1
dance.”	1
“Speak	1
respectfully	1
of	1
what	1
belongs	1
to	1
my	1
lady,	1
Sancho,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
“let	1
us	1
keep	1
the	1
feast	1
in	1
peace,	1
and	1
not	1
throw	1
the	1
rope	1
after	1
the	1
bucket.”	1
“I’ll	1
hold	1
my	1
tongue,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“but	1
how	1
am	1
I	1
to	1
take	1
it	1
patiently	1
when	1
your	1
worship	1
wants	1
me,	1
with	1
only	1
once	1
seeing	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
our	1
mistress,	1
to	1
know	1
always,	1
and	1
find	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
night,	1
when	1
your	1
worship	1
can’t	1
find	1
it,	1
who	1
must	1
have	1
seen	1
it	1
thousands	1
of	1
times?”	1
“Thou	1
wilt	1
drive	1
me	1
to	1
desperation,	1
Sancho,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote.	1
“Look	1
here,	1
heretic,	1
have	1
I	1
not	1
told	1
thee	1
a	1
thousand	1
times	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
never	1
once	1
in	1
my	1
life	1
seen	1
the	1
peerless	1
Dulcinea	1
or	1
crossed	1
the	1
threshold	1
of	1
her	1
palace,	1
and	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
enamoured	1
solely	1
by	1
hearsay	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
great	1
reputation	1
she	1
bears	1
for	1
beauty	1
and	1
discretion?”	1
“I	1
hear	1
it	1
now,”	1
returned	1
Sancho;	1
“and	1
I	1
may	1
tell	1
you	1
that	1
if	1
you	1
have	1
not	1
seen	1
her,	1
no	1
more	1
have	1
I.”	1
“That	1
cannot	1
be,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“for,	1
at	1
any	1
rate,	1
thou	1
saidst,	1
on	1
bringing	1
back	1
the	1
answer	1
to	1
the	1
letter	1
I	1
sent	1
by	1
thee,	1
that	1
thou	1
sawest	1
her	1
sifting	1
wheat.”	1
“Don’t	1
mind	1
that,	1
señor,”	1
said	1
Sancho;	1
“I	1
must	1
tell	1
you	1
that	1
my	1
seeing	1
her	1
and	1
the	1
answer	1
I	1
brought	1
you	1
back	1
were	1
by	1
hearsay	1
too,	1
for	1
I	1
can	1
no	1
more	1
tell	1
who	1
the	1
lady	1
Dulcinea	1
is	1
than	1
I	1
can	1
hit	1
the	1
sky.”	1
“Sancho,	1
Sancho,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“there	1
are	1
times	1
for	1
jests	1
and	1
times	1
when	1
jests	1
are	1
out	1
of	1
place;	1
if	1
I	1
tell	1
thee	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
neither	1
seen	1
nor	1
spoken	1
to	1
the	1
lady	1
of	1
my	1
heart,	1
it	1
is	1
no	1
reason	1
why	1
thou	1
shouldst	1
say	1
thou	1
hast	1
not	1
spoken	1
to	1
her	1
or	1
seen	1
her,	1
when	1
the	1
contrary	1
is	1
the	1
case,	1
as	1
thou	1
well	1
knowest.”	1
While	1
the	1
two	1
were	1
engaged	1
in	1
this	1
conversation,	1
they	1
perceived	1
someone	1
with	1
a	1
pair	1
of	1
mules	1
approaching	1
the	1
spot	1
where	1
they	1
stood,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
noise	1
the	1
plough	1
made,	1
as	1
it	1
dragged	1
along	1
the	1
ground,	1
they	1
guessed	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
some	1
labourer	1
who	1
had	1
got	1
up	1
before	1
daybreak	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
his	1
work,	1
and	1
so	1
it	1
proved	1
to	1
be.	1
He	1
came	1
along	1
singing	1
the	1
ballad	1
that	1
says-	1
Ill	1
did	1
ye	1
fare,	1
ye	1
men	1
of	1
France,	1
In	1
Roncesvalles	1
chase-	1
“May	1
I	1
die,	1
Sancho,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
when	1
he	1
heard	1
him,	1
“if	1
any	1
good	1
will	1
come	1
to	1
us	1
to-night!	1
Dost	1
thou	1
not	1
hear	1
what	1
that	1
clown	1
is	1
singing?”	1
“I	1
do,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“but	1
what	1
has	1
Roncesvalles	1
chase	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
what	1
we	1
have	1
in	1
hand?	1
He	1
might	1
just	1
as	1
well	1
be	1
singing	1
the	1
ballad	1
of	1
Calainos,	1
for	1
any	1
good	1
or	1
ill	1
that	1
can	1
come	1
to	1
us	1
in	1
our	1
business.”	1
By	1
this	1
time	1
the	1
labourer	1
had	1
come	1
up,	1
and	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
asked	1
him,	1
“Can	1
you	1
tell	1
me,	1
worthy	1
friend,	1
and	1
God	1
speed	1
you,	1
whereabouts	1
here	1
is	1
the	1
palace	1
of	1
the	1
peerless	1
princess	1
Doña	1
Dulcinea	1
del	1
Toboso?”	1
“Señor,”	1
replied	1
the	1
lad,	1
“I	1
am	1
a	1
stranger,	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
only	1
a	1
few	1
days	1
in	1
the	1
town,	1
doing	1
farm	1
work	1
for	1
a	1
rich	1
farmer.	1
In	1
that	1
house	1
opposite	1
there	1
live	1
the	1
curate	1
of	1
the	1
village	1
and	1
the	1
sacristan,	1
and	1
both	1
or	1
either	1
of	1
them	1
will	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
give	1
your	1
worship	1
some	1
account	1
of	1
this	1
lady	1
princess,	1
for	1
they	1
have	1
a	1
list	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
El	1
Toboso;	1
though	1
it	1
is	1
my	1
belief	1
there	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
princess	1
living	1
in	1
the	1
whole	1
of	1
it;	1
many	1
ladies	1
there	1
are,	1
of	1
quality,	1
and	1
in	1
her	1
own	1
house	1
each	1
of	1
them	1
may	1
be	1
a	1
princess.”	1
“Well,	1
then,	1
she	1
I	1
am	1
inquiring	1
for	1
will	1
be	1
one	1
of	1
these,	1
my	1
friend,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote.	1
“May	1
be	1
so,”	1
replied	1
the	1
lad;	1
“God	1
be	1
with	1
you,	1
for	1
here	1
comes	1
the	1
daylight;”	1
and	1
without	1
waiting	1
for	1
any	1
more	1
of	1
his	1
questions,	1
he	1
whipped	1
on	1
his	1
mules.	1
Sancho,	1
seeing	1
his	1
master	1
downcast	1
and	1
somewhat	1
dissatisfied,	1
said	1
to	1
him,	1
“Señor,	1
daylight	1
will	1
be	1
here	1
before	1
long,	1
and	1
it	1
will	1
not	1
do	1
for	1
us	1
to	1
let	1
the	1
sun	1
find	1
us	1
in	1
the	1
street;	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
better	1
for	1
us	1
to	1
quit	1
the	1
city,	1
and	1
for	1
your	1
worship	1
to	1
hide	1
in	1
some	1
forest	1
in	1
the	1
neighbourhood,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
come	1
back	1
in	1
the	1
daytime,	1
and	1
I	1
won’t	1
leave	1
a	1
nook	1
or	1
corner	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
village	1
that	1
I	1
won’t	1
search	1
for	1
the	1
house,	1
castle,	1
or	1
palace,	1
of	1
my	1
lady,	1
and	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
hard	1
luck	1
for	1
me	1
if	1
I	1
don’t	1
find	1
it;	1
and	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
found	1
it	1
I	1
will	1
speak	1
to	1
her	1
grace,	1
and	1
tell	1
her	1
where	1
and	1
how	1
your	1
worship	1
is	1
waiting	1
for	1
her	1
to	1
arrange	1
some	1
plan	1
for	1
you	1
to	1
see	1
her	1
without	1
any	1
damage	1
to	1
her	1
honour	1
and	1
reputation.”	1
“Sancho,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“thou	1
hast	1
delivered	1
a	1
thousand	1
sentences	1
condensed	1
in	1
the	1
compass	1
of	1
a	1
few	1
words;	1
I	1
thank	1
thee	1
for	1
the	1
advice	1
thou	1
hast	1
given	1
me,	1
and	1
take	1
it	1
most	1
gladly.	1
Come,	1
my	1
son,	1
let	1
us	1
go	1
look	1
for	1
some	1
place	1
where	1
I	1
may	1
hide,	1
while	1
thou	1
dost	1
return,	1
as	1
thou	1
sayest,	1
to	1
seek,	1
and	1
speak	1
with	1
my	1
lady,	1
from	1
whose	1
discretion	1
and	1
courtesy	1
I	1
look	1
for	1
favours	1
more	1
than	1
miraculous.”	1
Sancho	1
was	1
in	1
a	1
fever	1
to	1
get	1
his	1
master	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
town,	1
lest	1
he	1
should	1
discover	1
the	1
falsehood	1
of	1
the	1
reply	1
he	1
had	1
brought	1
to	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
Sierra	1
Morena	1
on	1
behalf	1
of	1
Dulcinea;	1
so	1
he	1
hastened	1
their	1
departure,	1
which	1
they	1
took	1
at	1
once,	1
and	1
two	1
miles	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
village	1
they	1
found	1
a	1
forest	1
or	1
thicket	1
wherein	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
ensconced	1
himself,	1
while	1
Sancho	1
returned	1
to	1
the	1
city	1
to	1
speak	1
to	1
Dulcinea,	1
in	1
which	1
embassy	1
things	1
befell	1
him	1
which	1
demand	1
fresh	1
attention	1
and	1

When	1
the	1
author	1
of	1
this	1
great	1
history	1
comes	1
to	1
relate	1
what	1
is	1
set	1
down	1
in	1
this	1
chapter	1
he	1
says	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
preferred	1
to	1
pass	1
it	1
over	1
in	1
silence,	1
fearing	1
it	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
believed,	1
because	1
here	1
Don	1
Quixote’s	1
madness	1
reaches	1
the	1
confines	1
of	1
the	1
greatest	1
that	1
can	1
be	1
conceived,	1
and	1
even	1
goes	1
a	1
couple	1
of	1
bowshots	1
beyond	1
the	1
greatest.	1
But	1
after	1
all,	1
though	1
still	1
under	1
the	1
same	1
fear	1
and	1
apprehension,	1
he	1
has	1
recorded	1
it	1
without	1
adding	1
to	1
the	1
story	1
or	1
leaving	1
out	1
a	1
particle	1
of	1
the	1
truth,	1
and	1
entirely	1
disregarding	1
the	1
charges	1
of	1
falsehood	1
that	1
might	1
be	1
brought	1
against	1
him;	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
right,	1
for	1
the	1
truth	1
may	1
run	1
fine	1
but	1
will	1
not	1
break,	1
and	1
always	1
rises	1
above	1
falsehood	1
as	1
oil	1
above	1
water;	1
and	1
so,	1
going	1
on	1
with	1
his	1
story,	1
he	1
says	1
that	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
had	1
ensconced	1
himself	1
in	1
the	1
forest,	1
oak	1
grove,	1
or	1
wood	1
near	1
El	1
Toboso,	1
he	1
bade	1
Sancho	1
return	1
to	1
the	1
city,	1
and	1
not	1
come	1
into	1
his	1
presence	1
again	1
without	1
having	1
first	1
spoken	1
on	1
his	1
behalf	1
to	1
his	1
lady,	1
and	1
begged	1
of	1
her	1
that	1
it	1
might	1
be	1
her	1
good	1
pleasure	1
to	1
permit	1
herself	1
to	1
be	1
seen	1
by	1
her	1
enslaved	1
knight,	1
and	1
deign	1
to	1
bestow	1
her	1
blessing	1
upon	1
him,	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
thereby	1
hope	1
for	1
a	1
happy	1
issue	1
in	1
all	1
his	1
encounters	1
and	1
difficult	1
enterprises.	1
Sancho	1
undertook	1
to	1
execute	1
the	1
task	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
instructions,	1
and	1
to	1
bring	1
back	1
an	1
answer	1
as	1
good	1
as	1
the	1
one	1
he	1
brought	1
back	1
before.	1
“Go,	1
my	1
son,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“and	1
be	1
not	1
dazed	1
when	1
thou	1
findest	1
thyself	1
exposed	1
to	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
that	1
sun	1
of	1
beauty	1
thou	1
art	1
going	1
to	1
seek.	1
Happy	1
thou,	1
above	1
all	1
the	1
squires	1
in	1
the	1
world!	1
Bear	1
in	1
mind,	1
and	1
let	1
it	1
not	1
escape	1
thy	1
memory,	1
how	1
she	1
receives	1
thee;	1
if	1
she	1
changes	1
colour	1
while	1
thou	1
art	1
giving	1
her	1
my	1
message;	1
if	1
she	1
is	1
agitated	1
and	1
disturbed	1
at	1
hearing	1
my	1
name;	1
if	1
she	1
cannot	1
rest	1
upon	1
her	1
cushion,	1
shouldst	1
thou	1
haply	1
find	1
her	1
seated	1
in	1
the	1
sumptuous	1
state	1
chamber	1
proper	1
to	1
her	1
rank;	1
and	1
should	1
she	1
be	1
standing,	1
observe	1
if	1
she	1
poises	1
herself	1
now	1
on	1
one	1
foot,	1
now	1
on	1
the	1
other;	1
if	1
she	1
repeats	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
times	1
the	1
reply	1
she	1
gives	1
thee;	1
if	1
she	1
passes	1
from	1
gentleness	1
to	1
austerity,	1
from	1
asperity	1
to	1
tenderness;	1
if	1
she	1
raises	1
her	1
hand	1
to	1
smooth	1
her	1
hair	1
though	1
it	1
be	1
not	1
disarranged.	1
In	1
short,	1
my	1
son,	1
observe	1
all	1
her	1
actions	1
and	1
motions,	1
for	1
if	1
thou	1
wilt	1
report	1
them	1
to	1
me	1
as	1
they	1
were,	1
I	1
will	1
gather	1
what	1
she	1
hides	1
in	1
the	1
recesses	1
of	1
her	1
heart	1
as	1
regards	1
my	1
love;	1
for	1
I	1
would	1
have	1
thee	1
know,	1
Sancho,	1
if	1
thou	1
knowest	1
it	1
not,	1
that	1
with	1
lovers	1
the	1
outward	1
actions	1
and	1
motions	1
they	1
give	1
way	1
to	1
when	1
their	1
loves	1
are	1
in	1
question	1
are	1
the	1
faithful	1
messengers	1
that	1
carry	1
the	1
news	1
of	1
what	1
is	1
going	1
on	1
in	1
the	1
depths	1
of	1
their	1
hearts.	1
Go,	1
my	1
friend,	1
may	1
better	1
fortune	1
than	1
mine	1
attend	1
thee,	1
and	1
bring	1
thee	1
a	1
happier	1
issue	1
than	1
that	1
which	1
I	1
await	1
in	1
dread	1
in	1
this	1
dreary	1
solitude.”	1
“I	1
will	1
go	1
and	1
return	1
quickly,”	1
said	1
Sancho;	1
“cheer	1
up	1
that	1
little	1
heart	1
of	1
yours,	1
master	1
mine,	1
for	1
at	1
the	1
present	1
moment	1
you	1
seem	1
to	1
have	1
got	1
one	1
no	1
bigger	1
than	1
a	1
hazel	1
nut;	1
remember	1
what	1
they	1
say,	1
that	1
a	1
stout	1
heart	1
breaks	1
bad	1
luck,	1
and	1
that	1
where	1
there	1
are	1
no	1
fletches	1
there	1
are	1
no	1
pegs;	1
and	1
moreover	1
they	1
say,	1
the	1
hare	1
jumps	1
up	1
where	1
it’s	1
not	1
looked	1
for.	1
I	1
say	1
this	1
because,	1
if	1
we	1
could	1
not	1
find	1
my	1
lady’s	1
palaces	1
or	1
castles	1
to-night,	1
now	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
daylight	1
I	1
count	1
upon	1
finding	1
them	1
when	1
I	1
least	1
expect	1
it,	1
and	1
once	1
found,	1
leave	1
it	1
to	1
me	1
to	1
manage	1
her.”	1
“Verily,	1
Sancho,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“thou	1
dost	1
always	1
bring	1
in	1
thy	1
proverbs	1
happily,	1
whatever	1
we	1
deal	1
with;	1
may	1
God	1
give	1
me	1
better	1
luck	1
in	1
what	1
I	1
am	1
anxious	1
about.”	1
With	1
this,	1
Sancho	1
wheeled	1
about	1
and	1
gave	1
Dapple	1
the	1
stick,	1
and	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
remained	1
behind,	1
seated	1
on	1
his	1
horse,	1
resting	1
in	1
his	1
stirrups	1
and	1
leaning	1
on	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
his	1
lance,	1
filled	1
with	1
sad	1
and	1
troubled	1
forebodings;	1
and	1
there	1
we	1
will	1
leave	1
him,	1
and	1
accompany	1
Sancho,	1
who	1
went	1
off	1
no	1
less	1
serious	1
and	1
troubled	1
than	1
he	1
left	1
his	1
master;	1
so	1
much	1
so,	1
that	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
got	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
thicket,	1
and	1
looking	1
round	1
saw	1
that	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
was	1
not	1
within	1
sight,	1
he	1
dismounted	1
from	1
his	1
ass,	1
and	1
seating	1
himself	1
at	1
the	1
foot	1
of	1
a	1
tree	1
began	1
to	1
commune	1
with	1
himself,	1
saying,	1
“Now,	1
brother	1
Sancho,	1
let	1
us	1
know	1
where	1
your	1
worship	1
is	1
going.	1
Are	1
you	1
going	1
to	1
look	1
for	1
some	1
ass	1
that	1
has	1
been	1
lost?	1
Not	1
at	1
all.	1
Then	1
what	1
are	1
you	1
going	1
to	1
look	1
for?	1
I	1
am	1
going	1
to	1
look	1
for	1
a	1
princess,	1
that’s	1
all;	1
and	1
in	1
her	1
for	1
the	1
sun	1
of	1
beauty	1
and	1
the	1
whole	1
heaven	1
at	1
once.	1
And	1
where	1
do	1
you	1
expect	1
to	1
find	1
all	1
this,	1
Sancho?	1
Where?	1
Why,	1
in	1
the	1
great	1
city	1
of	1
El	1
Toboso.	1
Well,	1
and	1
for	1
whom	1
are	1
you	1
going	1
to	1
look	1
for	1
her?	1
For	1
the	1
famous	1
knight	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
of	1
La	1
Mancha,	1
who	1
rights	1
wrongs,	1
gives	1
food	1
to	1
those	1
who	1
thirst	1
and	1
drink	1
to	1
the	1
hungry.	1
That’s	1
all	1
very	1
well,	1
but	1
do	1
you	1
know	1
her	1
house,	1
Sancho?	1
My	1
master	1
says	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
some	1
royal	1
palace	1
or	1
grand	1
castle.	1
And	1
have	1
you	1
ever	1
seen	1
her	1
by	1
any	1
chance?	1
Neither	1
I	1
nor	1
my	1
master	1
ever	1
saw	1
her.	1
And	1
does	1
it	1
strike	1
you	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
just	1
and	1
right	1
if	1
the	1
El	1
Toboso	1
people,	1
finding	1
out	1
that	1
you	1
were	1
here	1
with	1
the	1
intention	1
of	1
going	1
to	1
tamper	1
with	1
their	1
princesses	1
and	1
trouble	1
their	1
ladies,	1
were	1
to	1
come	1
and	1
cudgel	1
your	1
ribs,	1
and	1
not	1
leave	1
a	1
whole	1
bone	1
in	1
you?	1
They	1
would,	1
indeed,	1
have	1
very	1
good	1
reason,	1
if	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
see	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
under	1
orders,	1
and	1
that	1
‘you	1
are	1
a	1
messenger,	1
my	1
friend,	1
no	1
blame	1
belongs	1
to	1
you.’	1
Don’t	1
you	1
trust	1
to	1
that,	1
Sancho,	1
for	1
the	1
Manchegan	1
folk	1
are	1
as	1
hot-tempered	1
as	1
they	1
are	1
honest,	1
and	1
won’t	1
put	1
up	1
with	1
liberties	1
from	1
anybody.	1
By	1
the	1
Lord,	1
if	1
they	1
get	1
scent	1
of	1
you,	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
worse	1
for	1
you,	1
I	1
promise	1
you.	1
Be	1
off,	1
you	1
scoundrel!	1
Let	1
the	1
bolt	1
fall.	1
Why	1
should	1
I	1
go	1
looking	1
for	1
three	1
feet	1
on	1
a	1
cat,	1
to	1
please	1
another	1
man;	1
and	1
what	1
is	1
more,	1
when	1
looking	1
for	1
Dulcinea	1
will	1
be	1
looking	1
for	1
Marica	1
in	1
Ravena,	1
or	1
the	1
bachelor	1
in	1
Salamanca?	1
The	1
devil,	1
the	1
devil	1
and	1
nobody	1
else,	1
has	1
mixed	1
me	1
up	1
in	1
this	1
business!”	1
Such	1
was	1
the	1
soliloquy	1
Sancho	1
held	1
with	1
himself,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
conclusion	1
he	1
could	1
come	1
to	1
was	1
to	1
say	1
to	1
himself	1
again,	1
“Well,	1
there’s	1
remedy	1
for	1
everything	1
except	1
death,	1
under	1
whose	1
yoke	1
we	1
have	1
all	1
to	1
pass,	1
whether	1
we	1
like	1
it	1
or	1
not,	1
when	1
life’s	1
finished.	1
I	1
have	1
seen	1
by	1
a	1
thousand	1
signs	1
that	1
this	1
master	1
of	1
mine	1
is	1
a	1
madman	1
fit	1
to	1
be	1
tied,	1
and	1
for	1
that	1
matter,	1
I	1
too,	1
am	1
not	1
behind	1
him;	1
for	1
I’m	1
a	1
greater	1
fool	1
than	1
he	1
is	1
when	1
I	1
follow	1
him	1
and	1
serve	1
him,	1
if	1
there’s	1
any	1
truth	1
in	1
the	1
proverb	1
that	1
says,	1
‘Tell	1
me	1
what	1
company	1
thou	1
keepest,	1
and	1
I’ll	1
tell	1
thee	1
what	1
thou	1
art,’	1
or	1
in	1
that	1
other,	1
‘Not	1
with	1
whom	1
thou	1
art	1
bred,	1
but	1
with	1
whom	1
thou	1
art	1
fed.’	1
Well	1
then,	1
if	1
he	1
be	1
mad,	1
as	1
he	1
is,	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
madness	1
that	1
mostly	1
takes	1
one	1
thing	1
for	1
another,	1
and	1
white	1
for	1
black,	1
and	1
black	1
for	1
white,	1
as	1
was	1
seen	1
when	1
he	1
said	1
the	1
windmills	1
were	1
giants,	1
and	1
the	1
monks’	1
mules	1
dromedaries,	1
flocks	1
of	1
sheep	1
armies	1
of	1
enemies,	1
and	1
much	1
more	1
to	1
the	1
same	1
tune,	1
it	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
very	1
hard	1
to	1
make	1
him	1
believe	1
that	1
some	1
country	1
girl,	1
the	1
first	1
I	1
come	1
across	1
here,	1
is	1
the	1
lady	1
Dulcinea;	1
and	1
if	1
he	1
does	1
not	1
believe	1
it,	1
I’ll	1
swear	1
it;	1
and	1
if	1
he	1
should	1
swear,	1
I’ll	1
swear	1
again;	1
and	1
if	1
he	1
persists	1
I’ll	1
persist	1
still	1
more,	1
so	1
as,	1
come	1
what	1
may,	1
to	1
have	1
my	1
quoit	1
always	1
over	1
the	1
peg.	1
Maybe,	1
by	1
holding	1
out	1
in	1
this	1
way,	1
I	1
may	1
put	1
a	1
stop	1
to	1
his	1
sending	1
me	1
on	1
messages	1
of	1
this	1
kind	1
another	1
time;	1
or	1
maybe	1
he	1
will	1
think,	1
as	1
I	1
suspect	1
he	1
will,	1
that	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
wicked	1
enchanters,	1
who	1
he	1
says	1
have	1
a	1
spite	1
against	1
him,	1
has	1
changed	1
her	1
form	1
for	1
the	1
sake	1
of	1
doing	1
him	1
an	1
ill	1
turn	1
and	1
injuring	1
him.”	1
With	1
this	1
reflection	1
Sancho	1
made	1
his	1
mind	1
easy,	1
counting	1
the	1
business	1
as	1
good	1
as	1
settled,	1
and	1
stayed	1
there	1
till	1
the	1
afternoon	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
make	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
think	1
he	1
had	1
time	1
enough	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
El	1
Toboso	1
and	1
return;	1
and	1
things	1
turned	1
out	1
so	1
luckily	1
for	1
him	1
that	1
as	1
he	1
got	1
up	1
to	1
mount	1
Dapple,	1
he	1
spied,	1
coming	1
from	1
El	1
Toboso	1
towards	1
the	1
spot	1
where	1
he	1
stood,	1
three	1
peasant	1
girls	1
on	1
three	1
colts,	1
or	1
fillies—for	1
the	1
author	1
does	1
not	1
make	1
the	1
point	1
clear,	1
though	1
it	1
is	1
more	1
likely	1
they	1
were	1
she-asses,	1
the	1
usual	1
mount	1
with	1
village	1
girls;	1
but	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
of	1
no	1
great	1
consequence,	1
we	1
need	1
not	1
stop	1
to	1
prove	1
it.	1
To	1
be	1
brief,	1
the	1
instant	1
Sancho	1
saw	1
the	1
peasant	1
girls,	1
he	1
returned	1
full	1
speed	1
to	1
seek	1
his	1
master,	1
and	1
found	1
him	1
sighing	1
and	1
uttering	1
a	1
thousand	1
passionate	1
lamentations.	1
When	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
saw	1
him	1
he	1
exclaimed,	1
“What	1
news,	1
Sancho,	1
my	1
friend?	1
Am	1
I	1
to	1
mark	1
this	1
day	1
with	1
a	1
white	1
stone	1
or	1
a	1
black?”	1
“Your	1
worship,”	1
replied	1
Sancho,	1
“had	1
better	1
mark	1
it	1
with	1
ruddle,	1
like	1
the	1
inscriptions	1
on	1
the	1
walls	1
of	1
class	1
rooms,	1
that	1
those	1
who	1
see	1
it	1
may	1
see	1
it	1
plain.”	1
“Then	1
thou	1
bringest	1
good	1
news,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote.	1
“So	1
good,”	1
replied	1
Sancho,	1
“that	1
your	1
worship	1
has	1
only	1
to	1
spur	1
Rocinante	1
and	1
get	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
open	1
field	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
lady	1
Dulcinea	1
del	1
Toboso,	1
who,	1
with	1
two	1
others,	1
damsels	1
of	1
hers,	1
is	1
coming	1
to	1
see	1
your	1
worship.”	1
“Holy	1
God!	1
what	1
art	1
thou	1
saying,	1
Sancho,	1
my	1
friend?”	1
exclaimed	1
Don	1
Quixote.	1
“Take	1
care	1
thou	1
art	1
not	1
deceiving	1
me,	1
or	1
seeking	1
by	1
false	1
joy	1
to	1
cheer	1
my	1
real	1
sadness.”	1
“What	1
could	1
I	1
get	1
by	1
deceiving	1
your	1
worship,”	1
returned	1
Sancho,	1
“especially	1
when	1
it	1
will	1
so	1
soon	1
be	1
shown	1
whether	1
I	1
tell	1
the	1
truth	1
or	1
not?	1
Come,	1
señor,	1
push	1
on,	1
and	1
you	1
will	1
see	1
the	1
princess	1
our	1
mistress	1
coming,	1
robed	1
and	1
adorned—in	1
fact,	1
like	1
what	1
she	1
is.	1
Her	1
damsels	1
and	1
she	1
are	1
all	1
one	1
glow	1
of	1
gold,	1
all	1
bunches	1
of	1
pearls,	1
all	1
diamonds,	1
all	1
rubies,	1
all	1
cloth	1
of	1
brocade	1
of	1
more	1
than	1
ten	1
borders;	1
with	1
their	1
hair	1
loose	1
on	1
their	1
shoulders	1
like	1
so	1
many	1
sunbeams	1
playing	1
with	1
the	1
wind;	1
and	1
moreover,	1
they	1
come	1
mounted	1
on	1
three	1
piebald	1
cackneys,	1
the	1
finest	1
sight	1
ever	1
you	1
saw.”	1
“Hackneys,	1
you	1
mean,	1
Sancho,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote.	1
“There	1
is	1
not	1
much	1
difference	1
between	1
cackneys	1
and	1
hackneys,”	1
said	1
Sancho;	1
“but	1
no	1
matter	1
what	1
they	1
come	1
on,	1
there	1
they	1
are,	1
the	1
finest	1
ladies	1
one	1
could	1
wish	1
for,	1
especially	1
my	1
lady	1
the	1
princess	1
Dulcinea,	1
who	1
staggers	1
one’s	1
senses.”	1
“Let	1
us	1
go,	1
Sancho,	1
my	1
son,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“and	1
in	1
guerdon	1
of	1
this	1
news,	1
as	1
unexpected	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
good,	1
I	1
bestow	1
upon	1
thee	1
the	1
best	1
spoil	1
I	1
shall	1
win	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
adventure	1
I	1
may	1
have;	1
or	1
if	1
that	1
does	1
not	1
satisfy	1
thee,	1
I	1
promise	1
thee	1
the	1
foals	1
I	1
shall	1
have	1
this	1
year	1
from	1
my	1
three	1
mares	1
that	1
thou	1
knowest	1
are	1
in	1
foal	1
on	1
our	1
village	1
common.”	1
“I’ll	1
take	1
the	1
foals,”	1
said	1
Sancho;	1
“for	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
quite	1
certain	1
that	1
the	1
spoils	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
adventure	1
will	1
be	1
good	1
ones.”	1
By	1
this	1
time	1
they	1
had	1
cleared	1
the	1
wood,	1
and	1
saw	1
the	1
three	1
village	1
lasses	1
close	1
at	1
hand.	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
looked	1
all	1
along	1
the	1
road	1
to	1
El	1
Toboso,	1
and	1
as	1
he	1
could	1
see	1
nobody	1
except	1
the	1
three	1
peasant	1
girls,	1
he	1
was	1
completely	1
puzzled,	1
and	1
asked	1
Sancho	1
if	1
it	1
was	1
outside	1
the	1
city	1
he	1
had	1
left	1
them.	1
“How	1
outside	1
the	1
city?”	1
returned	1
Sancho.	1
“Are	1
your	1
worship’s	1
eyes	1
in	1
the	1
back	1
of	1
your	1
head,	1
that	1
you	1
can’t	1
see	1
that	1
they	1
are	1
these	1
who	1
are	1
coming	1
here,	1
shining	1
like	1
the	1
very	1
sun	1
at	1
noonday?”	1
“I	1
see	1
nothing,	1
Sancho,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“but	1
three	1
country	1
girls	1
on	1
three	1
jackasses.”	1
“Now,	1
may	1
God	1
deliver	1
me	1
from	1
the	1
devil!”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“and	1
can	1
it	1
be	1
that	1
your	1
worship	1
takes	1
three	1
hackneys—or	1
whatever	1
they’re	1
called—as	1
white	1
as	1
the	1
driven	1
snow,	1
for	1
jackasses?	1
By	1
the	1
Lord,	1
I	1
could	1
tear	1
my	1
beard	1
if	1
that	1
was	1
the	1
case!”	1
“Well,	1
I	1
can	1
only	1
say,	1
Sancho,	1
my	1
friend,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“that	1
it	1
is	1
as	1
plain	1
they	1
are	1
jackasses—or	1
jennyasses—as	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
and	1
thou	1
Sancho	1
Panza:	1
at	1
any	1
rate,	1
they	1
seem	1
to	1
me	1
to	1
be	1
so.”	1
“Hush,	1
señor,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“don’t	1
talk	1
that	1
way,	1
but	1
open	1
your	1
eyes,	1
and	1
come	1
and	1
pay	1
your	1
respects	1
to	1
the	1
lady	1
of	1
your	1
thoughts,	1
who	1
is	1
close	1
upon	1
us	1
now;”	1
and	1
with	1
these	1
words	1
he	1
advanced	1
to	1
receive	1
the	1
three	1
village	1
lasses,	1
and	1
dismounting	1
from	1
Dapple,	1
caught	1
hold	1
of	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
asses	1
of	1
the	1
three	1
country	1
girls	1
by	1
the	1
halter,	1
and	1
dropping	1
on	1
both	1
knees	1
on	1
the	1
ground,	1
he	1
said,	1
“Queen	1
and	1
princess	1
and	1
duchess	1
of	1
beauty,	1
may	1
it	1
please	1
your	1
haughtiness	1
and	1
greatness	1
to	1
receive	1
into	1
your	1
favour	1
and	1
good-will	1
your	1
captive	1
knight	1
who	1
stands	1
there	1
turned	1
into	1
marble	1
stone,	1
and	1
quite	1
stupefied	1
and	1
benumbed	1
at	1
finding	1
himself	1
in	1
your	1
magnificent	1
presence.	1
I	1
am	1
Sancho	1
Panza,	1
his	1
squire,	1
and	1
he	1
the	1
vagabond	1
knight	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
of	1
La	1
Mancha,	1
otherwise	1
called	1
‘The	1
Knight	1
of	1
the	1
Rueful	1
Countenance.’”	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
had	1
by	1
this	1
time	1
placed	1
himself	1
on	1
his	1
knees	1
beside	1
Sancho,	1
and,	1
with	1
eyes	1
starting	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
head	1
and	1
a	1
puzzled	1
gaze,	1
was	1
regarding	1
her	1
whom	1
Sancho	1
called	1
queen	1
and	1
lady;	1
and	1
as	1
he	1
could	1
see	1
nothing	1
in	1
her	1
except	1
a	1
village	1
lass,	1
and	1
not	1
a	1
very	1
well-favoured	1
one,	1
for	1
she	1
was	1
platter-faced	1
and	1
snub-nosed,	1
he	1
was	1
perplexed	1
and	1
bewildered,	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
venture	1
to	1
open	1
his	1
lips.	1
The	1
country	1
girls,	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time,	1
were	1
astonished	1
to	1
see	1
these	1
two	1
men,	1
so	1
different	1
in	1
appearance,	1
on	1
their	1
knees,	1
preventing	1
their	1
companion	1
from	1
going	1
on.	1
She,	1
however,	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
stopped,	1
breaking	1
silence,	1
said	1
angrily	1
and	1
testily,	1
“Get	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
way,	1
bad	1
luck	1
to	1
you,	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
pass,	1
for	1
we	1
are	1
in	1
a	1
hurry.”	1

To	1
which	1
Sancho	1
returned,	1
“Oh,	1
princess	1
and	1
universal	1
lady	1
of	1
El	1
Toboso,	1
is	1
not	1
your	1
magnanimous	1
heart	1
softened	1
by	1
seeing	1
the	1
pillar	1
and	1
prop	1
of	1
knight-errantry	1
on	1
his	1
knees	1
before	1
your	1
sublimated	1
presence?”	1
On	1
hearing	1
this,	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
others	1
exclaimed,	1
“Woa	1
then!	1
why,	1
I’m	1
rubbing	1
thee	1
down,	1
she-ass	1
of	1
my	1
father-in-law!	1
See	1
how	1
the	1
lordlings	1
come	1
to	1
make	1
game	1
of	1
the	1
village	1
girls	1
now,	1
as	1
if	1
we	1
here	1
could	1
not	1
chaff	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
themselves.	1
Go	1
your	1
own	1
way,	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
go	1
ours,	1
and	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
better	1
for	1
you.”	1
“Get	1
up,	1
Sancho,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
at	1
this;	1
“I	1
see	1
that	1
fortune,	1
‘with	1
evil	1
done	1
to	1
me	1
unsated	1
still,’	1
has	1
taken	1
possession	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
roads	1
by	1
which	1
any	1
comfort	1
may	1
reach	1
‘this	1
wretched	1
soul’	1
that	1
I	1
carry	1
in	1
my	1
flesh.	1
And	1
thou,	1
highest	1
perfection	1
of	1
excellence	1
that	1
can	1
be	1
desired,	1
utmost	1
limit	1
of	1
grace	1
in	1
human	1
shape,	1
sole	1
relief	1
of	1
this	1
afflicted	1
heart	1
that	1
adores	1
thee,	1
though	1
the	1
malign	1
enchanter	1
that	1
persecutes	1
me	1
has	1
brought	1
clouds	1
and	1
cataracts	1
on	1
my	1
eyes,	1
and	1
to	1
them,	1
and	1
them	1
only,	1
transformed	1
thy	1
unparagoned	1
beauty	1
and	1
changed	1
thy	1
features	1
into	1
those	1
of	1
a	1
poor	1
peasant	1
girl,	1
if	1
so	1
be	1
he	1
has	1
not	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
changed	1
mine	1
into	1
those	1
of	1
some	1
monster	1
to	1
render	1
them	1
loathsome	1
in	1
thy	1
sight,	1
refuse	1
not	1
to	1
look	1
upon	1
me	1
with	1
tenderness	1
and	1
love;	1
seeing	1
in	1
this	1
submission	1
that	1
I	1
make	1
on	1
my	1
knees	1
to	1
thy	1
transformed	1
beauty	1
the	1
humility	1
with	1
which	1
my	1
soul	1
adores	1
thee.”	1
“Hey-day!	1
My	1
grandfather!”	1
cried	1
the	1
girl,	1
“much	1
I	1
care	1
for	1
your	1
love-making!	1
Get	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
way	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
pass,	1
and	1
we’ll	1
thank	1
you.”	1
Sancho	1
stood	1
aside	1
and	1
let	1
her	1
go,	1
very	1
well	1
pleased	1
to	1
have	1
got	1
so	1
well	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
hobble	1
he	1
was	1
in.	1
The	1
instant	1
the	1
village	1
lass	1
who	1
had	1
done	1
duty	1
for	1
Dulcinea	1
found	1
herself	1
free,	1
prodding	1
her	1
“cackney”	1
with	1
a	1
spike	1
she	1
had	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
a	1
stick,	1
she	1
set	1
off	1
at	1
full	1
speed	1
across	1
the	1
field.	1
The	1
she-ass,	1
however,	1
feeling	1
the	1
point	1
more	1
acutely	1
than	1
usual,	1
began	1
cutting	1
such	1
capers,	1
that	1
it	1
flung	1
the	1
lady	1
Dulcinea	1
to	1
the	1
ground;	1
seeing	1
which,	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
ran	1
to	1
raise	1
her	1
up,	1
and	1
Sancho	1
to	1
fix	1
and	1
girth	1
the	1
pack-saddle,	1
which	1
also	1
had	1
slipped	1
under	1
the	1
ass’s	1
belly.	1
The	1
pack-saddle	1
being	1
secured,	1
as	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
lift	1
up	1
his	1
enchanted	1
mistress	1
in	1
his	1
arms	1
and	1
put	1
her	1
upon	1
her	1
beast,	1
the	1
lady,	1
getting	1
up	1
from	1
the	1
ground,	1
saved	1
him	1
the	1
trouble,	1
for,	1
going	1
back	1
a	1
little,	1
she	1
took	1
a	1
short	1
run,	1
and	1
putting	1
both	1
hands	1
on	1
the	1
croup	1
of	1
the	1
ass	1
she	1
dropped	1
into	1
the	1
saddle	1
more	1
lightly	1
than	1
a	1
falcon,	1
and	1
sat	1
astride	1
like	1
a	1
man,	1
whereat	1
Sancho	1
said,	1
“Rogue!	1
but	1
our	1
lady	1
is	1
lighter	1
than	1
a	1
lanner,	1
and	1
might	1
teach	1
the	1
cleverest	1
Cordovan	1
or	1
Mexican	1
how	1
to	1
mount;	1
she	1
cleared	1
the	1
back	1
of	1
the	1
saddle	1
in	1
one	1
jump,	1
and	1
without	1
spurs	1
she	1
is	1
making	1
the	1
hackney	1
go	1
like	1
a	1
zebra;	1
and	1
her	1
damsels	1
are	1
no	1
way	1
behind	1
her,	1
for	1
they	1
all	1
fly	1
like	1
the	1
wind;”	1
which	1
was	1
the	1
truth,	1
for	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
they	1
saw	1
Dulcinea	1
mounted,	1
they	1
pushed	1
on	1
after	1
her,	1
and	1
sped	1
away	1
without	1
looking	1
back,	1
for	1
more	1
than	1
half	1
a	1
league.	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
followed	1
them	1
with	1
his	1
eyes,	1
and	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
no	1
longer	1
in	1
sight,	1
he	1
turned	1
to	1
Sancho	1
and	1
said,	1
“How	1
now,	1
Sancho?	1
thou	1
seest	1
how	1
I	1
am	1
hated	1
by	1
enchanters!	1
And	1
see	1
to	1
what	1
a	1
length	1
the	1
malice	1
and	1
spite	1
they	1
bear	1
me	1
go,	1
when	1
they	1
seek	1
to	1
deprive	1
me	1
of	1
the	1
happiness	1
it	1
would	1
give	1
me	1
to	1
see	1
my	1
lady	1
in	1
her	1
own	1
proper	1
form.	1
The	1
fact	1
is	1
I	1
was	1
born	1
to	1
be	1
an	1
example	1
of	1
misfortune,	1
and	1
the	1
target	1
and	1
mark	1
at	1
which	1
the	1
arrows	1
of	1
adversity	1
are	1
aimed	1
and	1
directed.	1
Observe	1
too,	1
Sancho,	1
that	1
these	1
traitors	1
were	1
not	1
content	1
with	1
changing	1
and	1
transforming	1
my	1
Dulcinea,	1
but	1
they	1
transformed	1
and	1
changed	1
her	1
into	1
a	1
shape	1
as	1
mean	1
and	1
ill-favoured	1
as	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
village	1
girl	1
yonder;	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
they	1
robbed	1
her	1
of	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
such	1
a	1
peculiar	1
property	1
of	1
ladies	1
of	1
distinction,	1
that	1
is	1
to	1
say,	1
the	1
sweet	1
fragrance	1
that	1
comes	1
of	1
being	1
always	1
among	1
perfumes	1
and	1
flowers.	1
For	1
I	1
must	1
tell	1
thee,	1
Sancho,	1
that	1
when	1
I	1
approached	1
to	1
put	1
Dulcinea	1
upon	1
her	1
hackney	1
(as	1
thou	1
sayest	1
it	1
was,	1
though	1
to	1
me	1
it	1
appeared	1
a	1
she-ass),	1
she	1
gave	1
me	1
a	1
whiff	1
of	1
raw	1
garlic	1
that	1
made	1
my	1
head	1
reel,	1
and	1
poisoned	1
my	1
very	1
heart.”	1
“O	1
scum	1
of	1
the	1
earth!”	1
cried	1
Sancho	1
at	1
this,	1
“O	1
miserable,	1
spiteful	1
enchanters!	1
O	1
that	1
I	1
could	1
see	1
you	1
all	1
strung	1
by	1
the	1
gills,	1
like	1
sardines	1
on	1
a	1
twig!	1
Ye	1
know	1
a	1
great	1
deal,	1
ye	1
can	1
do	1
a	1
great	1
deal,	1
and	1
ye	1
do	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
more.	1
It	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
enough	1
for	1
you,	1
ye	1
scoundrels,	1
to	1
have	1
changed	1
the	1
pearls	1
of	1
my	1
lady’s	1
eyes	1
into	1
oak	1
galls,	1
and	1
her	1
hair	1
of	1
purest	1
gold	1
into	1
the	1
bristles	1
of	1
a	1
red	1
ox’s	1
tail,	1
and	1
in	1
short,	1
all	1
her	1
features	1
from	1
fair	1
to	1
foul,	1
without	1
meddling	1
with	1
her	1
smell;	1
for	1
by	1
that	1
we	1
might	1
somehow	1
have	1
found	1
out	1
what	1
was	1
hidden	1
underneath	1
that	1
ugly	1
rind;	1
though,	1
to	1
tell	1
the	1
truth,	1
I	1
never	1
perceived	1
her	1
ugliness,	1
but	1
only	1
her	1
beauty,	1
which	1
was	1
raised	1
to	1
the	1
highest	1
pitch	1
of	1
perfection	1
by	1
a	1
mole	1
she	1
had	1
on	1
her	1
right	1
lip,	1
like	1
a	1
moustache,	1
with	1
seven	1
or	1
eight	1
red	1
hairs	1
like	1
threads	1
of	1
gold,	1
and	1
more	1
than	1
a	1
palm	1
long.”	1
“From	1
the	1
correspondence	1
which	1
exists	1
between	1
those	1
of	1
the	1
face	1
and	1
those	1
of	1
the	1
body,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“Dulcinea	1
must	1
have	1
another	1
mole	1
resembling	1
that	1
on	1
the	1
thick	1
of	1
the	1
thigh	1
on	1
that	1
side	1
on	1
which	1
she	1
has	1
the	1
one	1
on	1
her	1
face;	1
but	1
hairs	1
of	1
the	1
length	1
thou	1
hast	1
mentioned	1
are	1
very	1
long	1
for	1
moles.”	1
“Well,	1
all	1
I	1
can	1
say	1
is	1
there	1
they	1
were	1
as	1
plain	1
as	1
could	1
be,”	1
replied	1
Sancho.	1
“I	1
believe	1
it,	1
my	1
friend,”	1
returned	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
“for	1
nature	1
bestowed	1
nothing	1
on	1
Dulcinea	1
that	1
was	1
not	1
perfect	1
and	1
well-finished;	1
and	1
so,	1
if	1
she	1
had	1
a	1
hundred	1
moles	1
like	1
the	1
one	1
thou	1
hast	1
described,	1
in	1
her	1
they	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
moles,	1
but	1
moons	1
and	1
shining	1
stars.	1
But	1
tell	1
me,	1
Sancho,	1
that	1
which	1
seemed	1
to	1
me	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
pack-saddle	1
as	1
thou	1
wert	1
fixing	1
it,	1
was	1
it	1
a	1
flat-saddle	1
or	1
a	1
side-saddle?”	1
“It	1
was	1
neither,”	1
replied	1
Sancho,	1
“but	1
a	1
jineta	1
saddle,	1
with	1
a	1
field	1
covering	1
worth	1
half	1
a	1
kingdom,	1
so	1
rich	1
is	1
it.”	1
“And	1
that	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
see	1
all	1
this,	1
Sancho!”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
“once	1
more	1
I	1
say,	1
and	1
will	1
say	1
a	1
thousand	1
times,	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
most	1
unfortunate	1
of	1
men.”	1
Sancho,	1
the	1
rogue,	1
had	1
enough	1
to	1
do	1
to	1
hide	1
his	1
laughter,	1
at	1
hearing	1
the	1
simplicity	1
of	1
the	1
master	1
he	1
had	1
so	1
nicely	1
befooled.	1
At	1
length,	1
after	1
a	1
good	1
deal	1
more	1
conversation	1
had	1
passed	1
between	1
them,	1
they	1
remounted	1
their	1
beasts,	1
and	1
followed	1
the	1
road	1
to	1
Saragossa,	1
which	1
they	1
expected	1
to	1
reach	1
in	1
time	1
to	1
take	1
part	1
in	1
a	1
certain	1
grand	1
festival	1
which	1
is	1
held	1
every	1
year	1
in	1
that	1
illustrious	1
city;	1
but	1
before	1
they	1
got	1
there	1
things	1
happened	1
to	1
them,	1
so	1
many,	1
so	1
important,	1
and	1
so	1
strange,	1
that	1
they	1
deserve	1
to	1
be	1
recorded	1
and	1
read,	1
as	1
will	1
be	1
seen	1
farther	1
on.	1

Dejected	1
beyond	1
measure	1
did	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
pursue	1
his	1
journey,	1
turning	1
over	1
in	1
his	1
mind	1
the	1
cruel	1
trick	1
the	1
enchanters	1
had	1
played	1
him	1
in	1
changing	1
his	1
lady	1
Dulcinea	1
into	1
the	1
vile	1
shape	1
of	1
the	1
village	1
lass,	1
nor	1
could	1
he	1
think	1
of	1
any	1
way	1
of	1
restoring	1
her	1
to	1
her	1
original	1
form;	1
and	1
these	1
reflections	1
so	1
absorbed	1
him,	1
that	1
without	1
being	1
aware	1
of	1
it	1
he	1
let	1
go	1
Rocinante’s	1
bridle,	1
and	1
he,	1
perceiving	1
the	1
liberty	1
that	1
was	1
granted	1
him,	1
stopped	1
at	1
every	1
step	1
to	1
crop	1
the	1
fresh	1
grass	1
with	1
which	1
the	1
plain	1
abounded.	1
Sancho	1
recalled	1
him	1
from	1
his	1
reverie.	1
“Melancholy,	1
señor,”	1
said	1
he,	1
“was	1
made,	1
not	1
for	1
beasts,	1
but	1
for	1
men;	1
but	1
if	1
men	1
give	1
way	1
to	1
it	1
overmuch	1
they	1
turn	1
to	1
beasts;	1
control	1
yourself,	1
your	1
worship;	1
be	1
yourself	1
again;	1
gather	1
up	1
Rocinante’s	1
reins;	1
cheer	1
up,	1
rouse	1
yourself	1
and	1
show	1
that	1
gallant	1
spirit	1
that	1
knights-errant	1
ought	1
to	1
have.	1
What	1
the	1
devil	1
is	1
this?	1
What	1
weakness	1
is	1
this?	1
Are	1
we	1
here	1
or	1
in	1
France?	1
The	1
devil	1
fly	1
away	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
Dulcineas	1
in	1
the	1
world;	1
for	1
the	1
well-being	1
of	1
a	1
single	1
knight-errant	1
is	1
of	1
more	1
consequence	1
than	1
all	1
the	1
enchantments	1
and	1
transformations	1
on	1
earth.”	1
“Hush,	1
Sancho,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
in	1
a	1
weak	1
and	1
faint	1
voice,	1
“hush	1
and	1
utter	1
no	1
blasphemies	1
against	1
that	1
enchanted	1
lady;	1
for	1
I	1
alone	1
am	1
to	1
blame	1
for	1
her	1
misfortune	1
and	1
hard	1
fate;	1
her	1
calamity	1
has	1
come	1
of	1
the	1
hatred	1
the	1
wicked	1
bear	1
me.”	1
“So	1
say	1
I,”	1
returned	1
Sancho;	1
“his	1
heart	1
rend	1
in	1
twain,	1
I	1
trow,	1
who	1
saw	1
her	1
once,	1
to	1
see	1
her	1
now.”	1
“Thou	1
mayest	1
well	1
say	1
that,	1
Sancho,”	1
replied	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“as	1
thou	1
sawest	1
her	1
in	1
the	1
full	1
perfection	1
of	1
her	1
beauty;	1
for	1
the	1
enchantment	1
does	1
not	1
go	1
so	1
far	1
as	1
to	1
pervert	1
thy	1
vision	1
or	1
hide	1
her	1
loveliness	1
from	1
thee;	1
against	1
me	1
alone	1
and	1
against	1
my	1
eyes	1
is	1
the	1
strength	1
of	1
its	1
venom	1
directed.	1
Nevertheless,	1
there	1
is	1
one	1
thing	1
which	1
has	1
occurred	1
to	1
me,	1
and	1
that	1
is	1
that	1
thou	1
didst	1
ill	1
describe	1
her	1
beauty	1
to	1
me,	1
for,	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
I	1
recollect,	1
thou	1
saidst	1
that	1
her	1
eyes	1
were	1
pearls;	1
but	1
eyes	1
that	1
are	1
like	1
pearls	1
are	1
rather	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
a	1
sea-bream	1
than	1
of	1
a	1
lady,	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
persuaded	1
that	1
Dulcinea’s	1
must	1
be	1
green	1
emeralds,	1
full	1
and	1
soft,	1
with	1
two	1
rainbows	1
for	1
eyebrows;	1
take	1
away	1
those	1
pearls	1
from	1
her	1
eyes	1
and	1
transfer	1
them	1
to	1
her	1
teeth;	1
for	1
beyond	1
a	1
doubt,	1
Sancho,	1
thou	1
hast	1
taken	1
the	1
one	1
for	1
the	1
other,	1
the	1
eyes	1
for	1
the	1
teeth.”	1
“Very	1
likely,”	1
said	1
Sancho;	1
“for	1
her	1
beauty	1
bewildered	1
me	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
her	1
ugliness	1
did	1
your	1
worship;	1
but	1
let	1
us	1
leave	1
it	1
all	1
to	1
God,	1
who	1
alone	1
knows	1
what	1
is	1
to	1
happen	1
in	1
this	1
vale	1
of	1
tears,	1
in	1
this	1
evil	1
world	1
of	1
ours,	1
where	1
there	1
is	1
hardly	1
a	1
thing	1
to	1
be	1
found	1
without	1
some	1
mixture	1
of	1
wickedness,	1
roguery,	1
and	1
rascality.	1
But	1
one	1
thing,	1
señor,	1
troubles	1
me	1
more	1
than	1
all	1
the	1
rest,	1
and	1
that	1
is	1
thinking	1
what	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
done	1
when	1
your	1
worship	1
conquers	1
some	1
giant,	1
or	1
some	1
other	1
knight,	1
and	1
orders	1
him	1
to	1
go	1
and	1
present	1
himself	1
before	1
the	1
beauty	1
of	1
the	1
lady	1
Dulcinea.	1
Where	1
is	1
this	1
poor	1
giant,	1
or	1
this	1
poor	1
wretch	1
of	1
a	1
vanquished	1
knight,	1
to	1
find	1
her?	1
I	1
think	1
I	1
can	1
see	1
them	1
wandering	1
all	1
over	1
El	1
Toboso,	1
looking	1
like	1
noddies,	1
and	1
asking	1
for	1
my	1
lady	1
Dulcinea;	1
and	1
even	1
if	1
they	1
meet	1
her	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
street	1
they	1
won’t	1
know	1
her	1
any	1
more	1
than	1
they	1
would	1
my	1
father.”	1
“Perhaps,	1
Sancho,”	1
returned	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“the	1
enchantment	1
does	1
not	1
go	1
so	1
far	1
as	1
to	1
deprive	1
conquered	1
and	1
presented	1
giants	1
and	1
knights	1
of	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
recognising	1
Dulcinea;	1
we	1
will	1
try	1
by	1
experiment	1
with	1
one	1
or	1
two	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
I	1
vanquish	1
and	1
send	1
to	1
her,	1
whether	1
they	1
see	1
her	1
or	1
not,	1
by	1
commanding	1
them	1
to	1
return	1
and	1
give	1
me	1
an	1
account	1
of	1
what	1
happened	1
to	1
them	1
in	1
this	1
respect.”	1
“I	1
declare,	1
I	1
think	1
what	1
your	1
worship	1
has	1
proposed	1
is	1
excellent,”	1
said	1
Sancho;	1
“and	1
that	1
by	1
this	1
plan	1
we	1
shall	1
find	1
out	1
what	1
we	1
want	1
to	1
know;	1
and	1
if	1
it	1
be	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
only	1
from	1
your	1
worship	1
she	1
is	1
hidden,	1
the	1
misfortune	1
will	1
be	1
more	1
yours	1
than	1
hers;	1
but	1
so	1
long	1
as	1
the	1
lady	1
Dulcinea	1
is	1
well	1
and	1
happy,	1
we	1
on	1
our	1
part	1
will	1
make	1
the	1
best	1
of	1
it,	1
and	1
get	1
on	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
we	1
can,	1
seeking	1
our	1
adventures,	1
and	1
leaving	1
Time	1
to	1
take	1
his	1
own	1
course;	1
for	1
he	1
is	1
the	1
best	1
physician	1
for	1
these	1
and	1
greater	1
ailments.”	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
reply	1
to	1
Sancho	1
Panza,	1
but	1
he	1
was	1
prevented	1
by	1
a	1
cart	1
crossing	1
the	1
road	1
full	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
diverse	1
and	1
strange	1
personages	1
and	1
figures	1
that	1
could	1
be	1
imagined.	1
He	1
who	1
led	1
the	1
mules	1
and	1
acted	1
as	1
carter	1
was	1
a	1
hideous	1
demon;	1
the	1
cart	1
was	1
open	1
to	1
the	1
sky,	1
without	1
a	1
tilt	1
or	1
cane	1
roof,	1
and	1
the	1
first	1
figure	1
that	1
presented	1
itself	1
to	1
Don	1
Quixote’s	1
eyes	1
was	1
that	1
of	1
Death	1
itself	1
with	1
a	1
human	1
face;	1
next	1
to	1
it	1
was	1
an	1
angel	1
with	1
large	1
painted	1
wings,	1
and	1
at	1
one	1
side	1
an	1
emperor,	1
with	1
a	1
crown,	1
to	1
all	1
appearance	1
of	1
gold,	1
on	1
his	1
head.	1
At	1
the	1
feet	1
of	1
Death	1
was	1
the	1
god	1
called	1
Cupid,	1
without	1
his	1
bandage,	1
but	1
with	1
his	1
bow,	1
quiver,	1
and	1
arrows;	1
there	1
was	1
also	1
a	1
knight	1
in	1
full	1
armour,	1
except	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
no	1
morion	1
or	1
helmet,	1
but	1
only	1
a	1
hat	1
decked	1
with	1
plumes	1
of	1
divers	1
colours;	1
and	1
along	1
with	1
these	1
there	1
were	1
others	1
with	1
a	1
variety	1
of	1
costumes	1
and	1
faces.	1
All	1
this,	1
unexpectedly	1
encountered,	1
took	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
somewhat	1
aback,	1
and	1
struck	1
terror	1
into	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
Sancho;	1
but	1
the	1
next	1
instant	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
was	1
glad	1
of	1
it,	1
believing	1
that	1
some	1
new	1
perilous	1
adventure	1
was	1
presenting	1
itself	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
under	1
this	1
impression,	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
spirit	1
prepared	1
to	1
face	1
any	1
danger,	1
he	1
planted	1
himself	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
the	1
cart,	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
loud	1
and	1
menacing	1
tone,	1
exclaimed,	1
“Carter,	1
or	1
coachman,	1
or	1
devil,	1
or	1
whatever	1
thou	1
art,	1
tell	1
me	1
at	1
once	1
who	1
thou	1
art,	1
whither	1
thou	1
art	1
going,	1
and	1
who	1
these	1
folk	1
are	1
thou	1
carriest	1
in	1
thy	1
wagon,	1
which	1
looks	1
more	1
like	1
Charon’s	1
boat	1
than	1
an	1
ordinary	1
cart.”	1
To	1
which	1
the	1
devil,	1
stopping	1
the	1
cart,	1
answered	1
quietly,	1
“Señor,	1
we	1
are	1
players	1
of	1
Angulo	1
el	1
Malo’s	1
company;	1
we	1
have	1
been	1
acting	1
the	1
play	1
of	1
‘The	1
Cortés	1
of	1
Death’	1
this	1
morning,	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
octave	1
of	1
Corpus	1
Christi,	1
in	1
a	1
village	1
behind	1
that	1
hill,	1
and	1
we	1
have	1
to	1
act	1
it	1
this	1
afternoon	1
in	1
that	1
village	1
which	1
you	1
can	1
see	1
from	1
this;	1
and	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
so	1
near,	1
and	1
to	1
save	1
the	1
trouble	1
of	1
undressing	1
and	1
dressing	1
again,	1
we	1
go	1
in	1
the	1
costumes	1
in	1
which	1
we	1
perform.	1
That	1
lad	1
there	1
appears	1
as	1
Death,	1
that	1
other	1
as	1
an	1
angel,	1
that	1
woman,	1
the	1
manager’s	1
wife,	1
plays	1
the	1
queen,	1
this	1
one	1
the	1
soldier,	1
that	1
the	1
emperor,	1
and	1
I	1
the	1
devil;	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
principal	1
characters	1
of	1
the	1
play,	1
for	1
in	1
this	1
company	1
I	1
take	1
the	1
leading	1
parts.	1
If	1
you	1
want	1
to	1
know	1
anything	1
more	1
about	1
us,	1
ask	1
me	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
answer	1
with	1
the	1
utmost	1
exactitude,	1
for	1
as	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
devil	1
I	1
am	1
up	1
to	1
everything.”	1
“By	1
the	1
faith	1
of	1
a	1
knight-errant,”	1
replied	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“when	1
I	1
saw	1
this	1
cart	1
I	1
fancied	1
some	1
great	1
adventure	1
was	1
presenting	1
itself	1
to	1
me;	1
but	1
I	1
declare	1
one	1
must	1
touch	1
with	1
the	1
hand	1
what	1
appears	1
to	1
the	1
eye,	1
if	1
illusions	1
are	1
to	1
be	1
avoided.	1
God	1
speed	1
you,	1
good	1
people;	1
keep	1
your	1
festival,	1
and	1
remember,	1
if	1
you	1
demand	1
of	1
me	1
ought	1
wherein	1
I	1
can	1
render	1
you	1
a	1
service,	1
I	1
will	1
do	1
it	1
gladly	1
and	1
willingly,	1
for	1
from	1
a	1
child	1
I	1
was	1
fond	1
of	1
the	1
play,	1
and	1
in	1
my	1
youth	1
a	1
keen	1
lover	1
of	1
the	1
actor’s	1
art.”	1
While	1
they	1
were	1
talking,	1
fate	1
so	1
willed	1
it	1
that	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
company	1
in	1
a	1
mummers’	1
dress	1
with	1
a	1
great	1
number	1
of	1
bells,	1
and	1
armed	1
with	1
three	1
blown	1
ox-bladders	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
a	1
stick,	1
joined	1
them,	1
and	1
this	1
merry-andrew	1
approaching	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
began	1
flourishing	1
his	1
stick	1
and	1
banging	1
the	1
ground	1
with	1
the	1
bladders	1
and	1
cutting	1
capers	1
with	1
great	1
jingling	1
of	1
the	1
bells,	1
which	1
untoward	1
apparition	1
so	1
startled	1
Rocinante	1
that,	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
Don	1
Quixote’s	1
efforts	1
to	1
hold	1
him	1
in,	1
taking	1
the	1
bit	1
between	1
his	1
teeth	1
he	1
set	1
off	1
across	1
the	1
plain	1
with	1
greater	1
speed	1
than	1
the	1
bones	1
of	1
his	1
anatomy	1
ever	1
gave	1
any	1
promise	1
of.	1

Sancho,	1
who	1
thought	1
his	1
master	1
was	1
in	1
danger	1
of	1
being	1
thrown,	1
jumped	1
off	1
Dapple,	1
and	1
ran	1
in	1
all	1
haste	1
to	1
help	1
him;	1
but	1
by	1
the	1
time	1
he	1
reached	1
him	1
he	1
was	1
already	1
on	1
the	1
ground,	1
and	1
beside	1
him	1
was	1
Rocinante,	1
who	1
had	1
come	1
down	1
with	1
his	1
master,	1
the	1
usual	1
end	1
and	1
upshot	1
of	1
Rocinante’s	1
vivacity	1
and	1
high	1
spirits.	1
But	1
the	1
moment	1
Sancho	1
quitted	1
his	1
beast	1
to	1
go	1
and	1
help	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
the	1
dancing	1
devil	1
with	1
the	1
bladders	1
jumped	1
up	1
on	1
Dapple,	1
and	1
beating	1
him	1
with	1
them,	1
more	1
by	1
the	1
fright	1
and	1
the	1
noise	1
than	1
by	1
the	1
pain	1
of	1
the	1
blows,	1
made	1
him	1
fly	1
across	1
the	1
fields	1
towards	1
the	1
village	1
where	1
they	1
were	1
going	1
to	1
hold	1
their	1
festival.	1
Sancho	1
witnessed	1
Dapple’s	1
career	1
and	1
his	1
master’s	1
fall,	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
which	1
of	1
the	1
two	1
cases	1
of	1
need	1
he	1
should	1
attend	1
to	1
first;	1
but	1
in	1
the	1
end,	1
like	1
a	1
good	1
squire	1
and	1
good	1
servant,	1
he	1
let	1
his	1
love	1
for	1
his	1
master	1
prevail	1
over	1
his	1
affection	1
for	1
his	1
ass;	1
though	1
every	1
time	1
he	1
saw	1
the	1
bladders	1
rise	1
in	1
the	1
air	1
and	1
come	1
down	1
on	1
the	1
hind	1
quarters	1
of	1
his	1
Dapple	1
he	1
felt	1
the	1
pains	1
and	1
terrors	1
of	1
death,	1
and	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
rather	1
had	1
the	1
blows	1
fall	1
on	1
the	1
apples	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
eyes	1
than	1
on	1
the	1
least	1
hair	1
of	1
his	1
ass’s	1
tail.	1
In	1
this	1
trouble	1
and	1
perplexity	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
where	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
lay	1
in	1
a	1
far	1
sorrier	1
plight	1
than	1
he	1
liked,	1
and	1
having	1
helped	1
him	1
to	1
mount	1
Rocinante,	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
him,	1
“Señor,	1
the	1
devil	1
has	1
carried	1
off	1
my	1
Dapple.”	1
“What	1
devil?”	1
asked	1
Don	1
Quixote.	1
“The	1
one	1
with	1
the	1
bladders,”	1
said	1
Sancho.	1
“Then	1
I	1
will	1
recover	1
him,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“even	1
if	1
he	1
be	1
shut	1
up	1
with	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
deepest	1
and	1
darkest	1
dungeons	1
of	1
hell.	1
Follow	1
me,	1
Sancho,	1
for	1
the	1
cart	1
goes	1
slowly,	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
mules	1
of	1
it	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
good	1
the	1
loss	1
of	1
Dapple.”	1
“You	1
need	1
not	1
take	1
the	1
trouble,	1
señor,”	1
said	1
Sancho;	1
“keep	1
cool,	1
for	1
as	1
I	1
now	1
see,	1
the	1
devil	1
has	1
let	1
Dapple	1
go	1
and	1
he	1
is	1
coming	1
back	1
to	1
his	1
old	1
quarters;”	1
and	1
so	1
it	1
turned	1
out,	1
for,	1
having	1
come	1
down	1
with	1
Dapple,	1
in	1
imitation	1
of	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
and	1
Rocinante,	1
the	1
devil	1
made	1
off	1
on	1
foot	1
to	1
the	1
town,	1
and	1
the	1
ass	1
came	1
back	1
to	1
his	1
master.	1
“For	1
all	1
that,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“it	1
will	1
be	1
well	1
to	1
visit	1
the	1
discourtesy	1
of	1
that	1
devil	1
upon	1
some	1
of	1
those	1
in	1
the	1
cart,	1
even	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
the	1
emperor	1
himself.”	1
“Don’t	1
think	1
of	1
it,	1
your	1
worship,”	1
returned	1
Sancho;	1
“take	1
my	1
advice	1
and	1
never	1
meddle	1
with	1
actors,	1
for	1
they	1
are	1
a	1
favoured	1
class;	1
I	1
myself	1
have	1
known	1
an	1
actor	1
taken	1
up	1
for	1
two	1
murders,	1
and	1
yet	1
come	1
off	1
scot-free;	1
remember	1
that,	1
as	1
they	1
are	1
merry	1
folk	1
who	1
give	1
pleasure,	1
everyone	1
favours	1
and	1
protects	1
them,	1
and	1
helps	1
and	1
makes	1
much	1
of	1
them,	1
above	1
all	1
when	1
they	1
are	1
those	1
of	1
the	1
royal	1
companies	1
and	1
under	1
patent,	1
all	1
or	1
most	1
of	1
whom	1
in	1
dress	1
and	1
appearance	1
look	1
like	1
princes.”	1
“Still,	1
for	1
all	1
that,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“the	1
player	1
devil	1
must	1
not	1
go	1
off	1
boasting,	1
even	1
if	1
the	1
whole	1
human	1
race	1
favours	1
him.”	1
So	1
saying,	1
he	1
made	1
for	1
the	1
cart,	1
which	1
was	1
now	1
very	1
near	1
the	1
town,	1
shouting	1
out	1
as	1
he	1
went,	1
“Stay!	1
halt!	1
ye	1
merry,	1
jovial	1
crew!	1
I	1
want	1
to	1
teach	1
you	1
how	1
to	1
treat	1
asses	1
and	1
animals	1
that	1
serve	1
the	1
squires	1
of	1
knights-errant	1
for	1
steeds.”	1
So	1
loud	1
were	1
the	1
shouts	1
of	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
that	1
those	1
in	1
the	1
cart	1
heard	1
and	1
understood	1
them,	1
and,	1
guessing	1
by	1
the	1
words	1
what	1
the	1
speaker’s	1
intention	1
was,	1
Death	1
in	1
an	1
instant	1
jumped	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
cart,	1
and	1
the	1
emperor,	1
the	1
devil	1
carter	1
and	1
the	1
angel	1
after	1
him,	1
nor	1
did	1
the	1
queen	1
or	1
the	1
god	1
Cupid	1
stay	1
behind;	1
and	1
all	1
armed	1
themselves	1
with	1
stones	1
and	1
formed	1
in	1
line,	1
prepared	1
to	1
receive	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
on	1
the	1
points	1
of	1
their	1
pebbles.	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
them	1
drawn	1
up	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
gallant	1
array	1
with	1
uplifted	1
arms	1
ready	1
for	1
a	1
mighty	1
discharge	1
of	1
stones,	1
checked	1
Rocinante	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
consider	1
in	1
what	1
way	1
he	1
could	1
attack	1
them	1
with	1
the	1
least	1
danger	1
to	1
himself.	1
As	1
he	1
halted	1
Sancho	1
came	1
up,	1
and	1
seeing	1
him	1
disposed	1
to	1
attack	1
this	1
well-ordered	1
squadron,	1
said	1
to	1
him,	1
“It	1
would	1
be	1
the	1
height	1
of	1
madness	1
to	1
attempt	1
such	1
an	1
enterprise;	1
remember,	1
señor,	1
that	1
against	1
sops	1
from	1
the	1
brook,	1
and	1
plenty	1
of	1
them,	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
defensive	1
armour	1
in	1
the	1
world,	1
except	1
to	1
stow	1
oneself	1
away	1
under	1
a	1
brass	1
bell;	1
and	1
besides,	1
one	1
should	1
remember	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
rashness,	1
and	1
not	1
valour,	1
for	1
a	1
single	1
man	1
to	1
attack	1
an	1
army	1
that	1
has	1
Death	1
in	1
it,	1
and	1
where	1
emperors	1
fight	1
in	1
person,	1
with	1
angels,	1
good	1
and	1
bad,	1
to	1
help	1
them;	1
and	1
if	1
this	1
reflection	1
will	1
not	1
make	1
you	1
keep	1
quiet,	1
perhaps	1
it	1
will	1
to	1
know	1
for	1
certain	1
that	1
among	1
all	1
these,	1
though	1
they	1
look	1
like	1
kings,	1
princes,	1
and	1
emperors,	1
there	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
single	1
knight-errant.”	1
“Now	1
indeed	1
thou	1
hast	1
hit	1
the	1
point,	1
Sancho,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“which	1
may	1
and	1
should	1
turn	1
me	1
from	1
the	1
resolution	1
I	1
had	1
already	1
formed.	1
I	1
cannot	1
and	1
must	1
not	1
draw	1
sword,	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
many	1
a	1
time	1
before	1
told	1
thee,	1
against	1
anyone	1
who	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
dubbed	1
knight;	1
it	1
is	1
for	1
thee,	1
Sancho,	1
if	1
thou	1
wilt,	1
to	1
take	1
vengeance	1
for	1
the	1
wrong	1
done	1
to	1
thy	1
Dapple;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
help	1
thee	1
from	1
here	1
by	1
shouts	1
and	1
salutary	1
counsels.”	1
“There	1
is	1
no	1
occasion	1
to	1
take	1
vengeance	1
on	1
anyone,	1
señor,”	1
replied	1
Sancho;	1
“for	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
the	1
part	1
of	1
good	1
Christians	1
to	1
revenge	1
wrongs;	1
and	1
besides,	1
I	1
will	1
arrange	1
it	1
with	1
my	1
ass	1
to	1
leave	1
his	1
grievance	1
to	1
my	1
good-will	1
and	1
pleasure,	1
and	1
that	1
is	1
to	1
live	1
in	1
peace	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
heaven	1
grants	1
me	1
life.”	1
“Well,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“if	1
that	1
be	1
thy	1
determination,	1
good	1
Sancho,	1
sensible	1
Sancho,	1
Christian	1
Sancho,	1
honest	1
Sancho,	1
let	1
us	1
leave	1
these	1
phantoms	1
alone	1
and	1
turn	1
to	1
the	1
pursuit	1
of	1
better	1
and	1
worthier	1
adventures;	1
for,	1
from	1
what	1
I	1
see	1
of	1
this	1
country,	1
we	1
cannot	1
fail	1
to	1
find	1
plenty	1
of	1
marvellous	1
ones	1
in	1
it.”	1
He	1
at	1
once	1
wheeled	1
about,	1
Sancho	1
ran	1
to	1
take	1
possession	1
of	1
his	1
Dapple,	1
Death	1
and	1
his	1
flying	1
squadron	1
returned	1
to	1

thus	1
the	1

Death,	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
and	1
his	1
squire	1
passed	1
under	1
some	1
tall	1
shady	1
trees,	1
and	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
at	1
Sancho’s	1
persuasion	1
ate	1
a	1
little	1
from	1
the	1
store	1
carried	1
by	1
Dapple,	1
and	1
over	1
their	1
supper	1
Sancho	1
said	1
to	1
his	1
master,	1
“Señor,	1
what	1
a	1
fool	1
I	1
should	1
have	1
looked	1
if	1
I	1
had	1
chosen	1
for	1
my	1
reward	1
the	1
spoils	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
adventure	1
your	1
worship	1
achieved,	1
instead	1
of	1
the	1
foals	1
of	1
the	1

After	1
all,	1
‘a	1
sparrow	1
in	1
the	1
hand	1
is	1
better	1
than	1
a	1
vulture	1
on	1
the	1
wing.’”	1
“At	1
the	1
same	1
time,	1
Sancho,”	1
replied	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“if	1
thou	1
hadst	1
let	1
me	1
attack	1
them	1
as	1
I	1
wanted,	1
at	1
the	1
very	1
least	1
the	1
emperor’s	1
gold	1
crown	1
and	1
Cupid’s	1
painted	1
wings	1
would	1
have	1
fallen	1
to	1
thee	1
as	1

for	1
I	1
should	1
have	1
taken	1
them	1
by	1
force	1
and	1
given	1
them	1
into	1
thy	1
hands.”	1
“The	1
sceptres	1
and	1
crowns	1
of	1
those	1
play-actor	1
emperors,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“were	1
never	1
yet	1
pure	1
gold,	1
but	1
only	1
brass	1
foil	1
or	1
tin.”	1
“That	1
is	1
true,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“for	1
it	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
right	1
that	1
the	1
accessories	1
of	1
the	1
drama	1
should	1
be	1
real,	1
instead	1
of	1
being	1
mere	1
fictions	1
and	1
semblances,	1
like	1
the	1
drama	1
itself;	1
towards	1
which,	1
Sancho—and,	1
as	1
a	1
necessary	1
consequence,	1
towards	1
those	1
who	1
represent	1
and	1
produce	1
it—I	1
would	1
that	1
thou	1
wert	1
favourably	1
disposed,	1
for	1
they	1
are	1
all	1
instruments	1
of	1
great	1
good	1
to	1
the	1
State,	1
placing	1
before	1
us	1
at	1
every	1
step	1
a	1
mirror	1
in	1
which	1
we	1
may	1
see	1
vividly	1
displayed	1
what	1
goes	1
on	1
in	1
human	1
life;	1
nor	1
is	1
there	1
any	1
similitude	1
that	1
shows	1
us	1
more	1
faithfully	1
what	1
we	1
are	1
and	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
than	1
the	1
play	1
and	1
the	1
players.	1
Come,	1
tell	1
me,	1
hast	1
thou	1
not	1
seen	1
a	1
play	1
acted	1
in	1
which	1
kings,	1
emperors,	1
pontiffs,	1
knights,	1
ladies,	1
and	1
divers	1
other	1
personages	1
were	1
introduced?	1
One	1
plays	1
the	1
villain,	1
another	1
the	1
knave,	1
this	1
one	1
the	1
merchant,	1
that	1
the	1
soldier,	1
one	1
the	1
sharp-witted	1
fool,	1
another	1
the	1
foolish	1
lover;	1
and	1
when	1
the	1
play	1
is	1
over,	1
and	1
they	1
have	1
put	1
off	1
the	1
dresses	1
they	1
wore	1
in	1
it,	1
all	1
the	1
actors	1
become	1
equal.”	1
“Yes,	1
I	1
have	1
seen	1
that,”	1
said	1
Sancho.	1
“Well	1
then,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“the	1
same	1
thing	1
happens	1
in	1
the	1
comedy	1
and	1
life	1
of	1
this	1
world,	1
where	1
some	1
play	1
emperors,	1
others	1
popes,	1
and,	1
in	1
short,	1
all	1
the	1
characters	1
that	1
can	1
be	1
brought	1
into	1
a	1
play;	1
but	1
when	1
it	1
is	1
over,	1
that	1
is	1
to	1
say	1
when	1
life	1
ends,	1
death	1
strips	1
them	1
all	1
of	1
the	1
garments	1
that	1
distinguish	1
one	1
from	1
the	1
other,	1
and	1
all	1
are	1
equal	1
in	1
the	1
grave.”	1
“A	1
fine	1
comparison!”	1
said	1
Sancho;	1
“though	1
not	1
so	1
new	1
but	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
heard	1
it	1
many	1
and	1
many	1
a	1
time,	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
that	1
other	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
game	1
of	1
chess;	1
how,	1
so	1
long	1
as	1
the	1
game	1
lasts,	1
each	1
piece	1
has	1
its	1
own	1
particular	1
office,	1
and	1
when	1
the	1
game	1
is	1
finished	1
they	1
are	1
all	1
mixed,	1
jumbled	1
up	1
and	1
shaken	1
together,	1
and	1
stowed	1
away	1
in	1
the	1
bag,	1
which	1
is	1
much	1
like	1
ending	1
life	1
in	1
the	1
grave.”	1
“Thou	1
art	1
growing	1
less	1
doltish	1
and	1
more	1
shrewd	1
every	1
day,	1
Sancho,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote.	1
“Ay,”	1
said	1
Sancho;	1
“it	1
must	1
be	1
that	1
some	1
of	1
your	1
worship’s	1
shrewdness	1
sticks	1
to	1
me;	1
land	1
that,	1
of	1
itself,	1
is	1
barren	1
and	1
dry,	1
will	1
come	1
to	1
yield	1
good	1
fruit	1
if	1
you	1
dung	1
it	1
and	1
till	1
it;	1
what	1
I	1
mean	1
is	1
that	1
your	1
worship’s	1
conversation	1
has	1
been	1
the	1
dung	1
that	1
has	1
fallen	1
on	1
the	1
barren	1
soil	1
of	1
my	1
dry	1
wit,	1
and	1
the	1
time	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
in	1
your	1
service	1
and	1
society	1
has	1
been	1
the	1
tillage;	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
help	1
of	1
this	1
I	1
hope	1
to	1
yield	1
fruit	1
in	1
abundance	1
that	1
will	1
not	1
fall	1
away	1
or	1
slide	1
from	1
those	1
paths	1
of	1
good	1
breeding	1
that	1
your	1
worship	1
has	1
made	1
in	1
my	1
parched	1
understanding.”	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
laughed	1
at	1
Sancho’s	1
affected	1
phraseology,	1
and	1
perceived	1
that	1
what	1
he	1
said	1
about	1
his	1
improvement	1
was	1
true,	1
for	1
now	1
and	1
then	1
he	1
spoke	1
in	1
a	1
way	1
that	1
surprised	1
him;	1
though	1
always,	1
or	1
mostly,	1
when	1
Sancho	1
tried	1
to	1
talk	1
fine	1
and	1
attempted	1
polite	1
language,	1
he	1
wound	1
up	1
by	1
toppling	1
over	1
from	1
the	1
summit	1
of	1
his	1
simplicity	1
into	1
the	1
abyss	1
of	1
his	1
ignorance;	1
and	1
where	1
he	1
showed	1
his	1
culture	1
and	1
his	1
memory	1
to	1
the	1
greatest	1
advantage	1
was	1
in	1
dragging	1
in	1
proverbs,	1
no	1
matter	1
whether	1
they	1
had	1
any	1
bearing	1
or	1
not	1
upon	1
the	1
subject	1
in	1
hand,	1
as	1
may	1
have	1
been	1
seen	1
already	1
and	1
will	1
be	1
noticed	1
in	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
this	1
history.	1

In	1
conversation	1
of	1
this	1
kind	1
they	1
passed	1
a	1
good	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
night,	1
but	1
Sancho	1
felt	1
a	1
desire	1
to	1
let	1
down	1
the	1
curtains	1
of	1
his	1
eyes,	1
as	1
he	1
used	1
to	1
say	1
when	1
he	1
wanted	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
sleep;	1
and	1
stripping	1
Dapple	1
he	1
left	1
him	1
at	1
liberty	1
to	1
graze	1
his	1
fill.	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
remove	1
Rocinante’s	1
saddle,	1
as	1
his	1
master’s	1
express	1
orders	1
were,	1
that	1
so	1
long	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
field	1
or	1
not	1
sleeping	1
under	1
a	1
roof	1
Rocinante	1
was	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
stripped—the	1
ancient	1
usage	1
established	1
and	1
observed	1
by	1
knights-errant	1
being	1
to	1
take	1
off	1
the	1
bridle	1
and	1
hang	1
it	1
on	1
the	1
saddle-bow,	1
but	1
to	1
remove	1
the	1
saddle	1
from	1
the	1
horse—never!	1
Sancho	1
acted	1
accordingly,	1
and	1
gave	1
him	1
the	1
same	1
liberty	1
he	1
had	1
given	1
Dapple,	1
between	1
whom	1
and	1
Rocinante	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
friendship	1
so	1
unequalled	1
and	1
so	1
strong,	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
handed	1
down	1
by	1
tradition	1
from	1
father	1
to	1
son,	1
that	1
the	1
author	1
of	1
this	1
veracious	1
history	1
devoted	1
some	1
special	1
chapters	1
to	1
it,	1
which,	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
preserve	1
the	1
propriety	1
and	1
decorum	1
due	1
to	1
a	1
history	1
so	1
heroic,	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
insert	1
therein;	1
although	1
at	1
times	1
he	1
forgets	1
this	1
resolution	1
of	1
his	1
and	1
describes	1
how	1
eagerly	1
the	1
two	1
beasts	1
would	1
scratch	1
one	1
another	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
together	1
and	1
how,	1
when	1
they	1
were	1
tired	1
or	1
full,	1
Rocinante	1
would	1
lay	1
his	1
neck	1
across	1
Dapple’s,	1
stretching	1
half	1
a	1
yard	1
or	1
more	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
side,	1
and	1
the	1
pair	1
would	1
stand	1
thus,	1
gazing	1
thoughtfully	1
on	1
the	1
ground,	1
for	1
three	1
days,	1
or	1
at	1
least	1
so	1
long	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
left	1
alone,	1
or	1
hunger	1
did	1
not	1
drive	1
them	1
to	1
go	1
and	1
look	1
for	1
food.	1
I	1
may	1
add	1
that	1
they	1
say	1
the	1
author	1
left	1
it	1
on	1
record	1
that	1
he	1
likened	1
their	1
friendship	1
to	1
that	1
of	1
Nisus	1
and	1
Euryalus,	1
and	1
Pylades	1
and	1
Orestes;	1
and	1
if	1
that	1
be	1
so,	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
perceived,	1
to	1
the	1
admiration	1
of	1
mankind,	1
how	1
firm	1
the	1
friendship	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
between	1
these	1
two	1
peaceful	1
animals,	1
shaming	1
men,	1
who	1
preserve	1
friendships	1
with	1
one	1
another	1
so	1
badly.	1
This	1
was	1
why	1
it	1
was	1
said-	1
For	1
friend	1
no	1
longer	1
is	1
there	1
friend;	1
The	1
reeds	1
turn	1
lances	1
now.	1
And	1
someone	1
else	1
has	1
sung—	1
Friend	1
to	1
friend	1
the	1
bug,	1
etc.	1
and	1
let	1
no	1
one	1
fancy	1
that	1
the	1
author	1
was	1
at	1
all	1
astray	1
when	1
he	1
compared	1
the	1
friendship	1
of	1
these	1
animals	1
to	1
that	1
of	1
men;	1
for	1
men	1
have	1
received	1
many	1
lessons	1
from	1
beasts,	1
and	1
learned	1
many	1
important	1
things,	1
as,	1
for	1
example,	1
the	1
clyster	1
from	1
the	1
stork,	1
vomit	1
and	1
gratitude	1
from	1
the	1
dog,	1
watchfulness	1
from	1
the	1
crane,	1
foresight	1
from	1
the	1
ant,	1
modesty	1
from	1
the	1
elephant,	1
and	1
loyalty	1
from	1
the	1
horse.	1
Sancho	1
at	1
last	1
fell	1
asleep	1
at	1
the	1
foot	1
of	1
a	1
cork	1
tree,	1
while	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
dozed	1
at	1
that	1
of	1
a	1
sturdy	1
oak;	1
but	1
a	1
short	1
time	1
only	1
had	1
elapsed	1
when	1
a	1
noise	1
he	1
heard	1
behind	1
him	1
awoke	1
him,	1
and	1
rising	1
up	1
startled,	1
he	1
listened	1
and	1
looked	1
in	1
the	1
direction	1
the	1
noise	1
came	1
from,	1
and	1
perceived	1
two	1
men	1
on	1
horseback,	1
one	1
of	1
whom,	1
letting	1
himself	1
drop	1
from	1
the	1
saddle,	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
other,	1
“Dismount,	1
my	1
friend,	1
and	1
take	1
the	1
bridles	1
off	1
the	1
horses,	1
for,	1
so	1
far	1
as	1
I	1
can	1
see,	1
this	1
place	1
will	1
furnish	1
grass	1
for	1
them,	1
and	1
the	1
solitude	1
and	1
silence	1
my	1
love-sick	1
thoughts	1
need	1
of.”	1
As	1
he	1
said	1
this	1
he	1
stretched	1
himself	1
upon	1
the	1
ground,	1
and	1
as	1
he	1
flung	1
himself	1
down,	1
the	1
armour	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
clad	1
rattled,	1
whereby	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
perceived	1
that	1
he	1
must	1
be	1
a	1
knight-errant;	1
and	1
going	1
over	1
to	1
Sancho,	1
who	1
was	1
asleep,	1
he	1
shook	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
arm	1
and	1
with	1
no	1
small	1
difficulty	1
brought	1
him	1
back	1
to	1
his	1
senses,	1
and	1
said	1
in	1
a	1
low	1
voice	1
to	1
him,	1
“Brother	1
Sancho,	1
we	1
have	1
got	1
an	1
adventure.”	1
“God	1
send	1
us	1
a	1
good	1
one,”	1
said	1
Sancho;	1
“and	1
where	1
may	1
her	1
ladyship	1
the	1
adventure	1
be?”	1
“Where,	1
Sancho?”	1
replied	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
“turn	1
thine	1
eyes	1
and	1
look,	1
and	1
thou	1
wilt	1
see	1
stretched	1
there	1
a	1
knight-errant,	1
who,	1
it	1
strikes	1
me,	1
is	1
not	1
over	1
and	1
above	1
happy,	1
for	1
I	1
saw	1
him	1
fling	1
himself	1
off	1
his	1
horse	1
and	1
throw	1
himself	1
on	1
the	1
ground	1
with	1
a	1
certain	1
air	1
of	1
dejection,	1
and	1
his	1
armour	1
rattled	1
as	1
he	1
fell.”	1
“Well,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“how	1
does	1
your	1
worship	1
make	1
out	1
that	1
to	1
be	1
an	1
adventure?”	1
“I	1
do	1
not	1
mean	1
to	1
say,”	1
returned	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“that	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
complete	1
adventure,	1
but	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
one,	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
in	1
this	1
way	1
adventures	1
begin.	1
But	1
listen,	1
for	1
it	1
seems	1
he	1
is	1
tuning	1
a	1
lute	1
or	1
guitar,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
way	1
he	1
is	1
spitting	1
and	1
clearing	1
his	1
chest	1
he	1
must	1
be	1
getting	1
ready	1
to	1
sing	1
something.”	1
“Faith,	1
you	1
are	1
right,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“and	1
no	1
doubt	1
he	1
is	1
some	1
enamoured	1
knight.”	1
“There	1
is	1
no	1
knight-errant	1
that	1
is	1
not,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
“but	1
let	1
us	1
listen	1
to	1
him,	1
for,	1
if	1
he	1
sings,	1
by	1
that	1
thread	1
we	1
shall	1
extract	1
the	1
ball	1
of	1
his	1
thoughts;	1
because	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
abundance	1
of	1
the	1
heart	1
the	1
mouth	1
speaketh.”	1
Sancho	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
reply	1
to	1
his	1
master,	1
but	1
the	1
Knight	1
of	1
the	1
Grove’s	1
voice,	1
which	1
was	1
neither	1
very	1
bad	1
nor	1
very	1
good,	1
stopped	1
him,	1
and	1
listening	1
attentively	1
the	1
pair	1
heard	1
him	1
sing	1
this	1
SONNET	1
Your	1
pleasure,	1
prithee,	1
lady	1
mine,	1
unfold;	1
Declare	1
the	1
terms	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
to	1
obey;	1
My	1
will	1
to	1
yours	1
submissively	1
I	1
mould,	1
And	1
from	1
your	1
law	1
my	1
feet	1
shall	1
never	1
stray.	1
Would	1
you	1
I	1
die,	1
to	1
silent	1
grief	1
a	1
prey?	1
Then	1
count	1
me	1
even	1
now	1
as	1
dead	1
and	1
cold;	1
Would	1
you	1
I	1
tell	1
my	1
woes	1
in	1
some	1
new	1
way?	1
Then	1
shall	1
my	1
tale	1
by	1
Love	1
itself	1
be	1
told.	1
The	1
unison	1
of	1
opposites	1
to	1
prove,	1
Of	1
the	1
soft	1
wax	1
and	1
diamond	1
hard	1
am	1
I;	1
But	1
still,	1
obedient	1
to	1
the	1
laws	1
of	1
love,	1
Here,	1
hard	1
or	1
soft,	1
I	1
offer	1
you	1
my	1
breast,	1
Whate’er	1
you	1
grave	1
or	1
stamp	1
thereon	1
shall	1
rest	1
Indelible	1
for	1
all	1
eternity.	1
With	1
an	1
“Ah	1
me!”	1
that	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
drawn	1
from	1
the	1
inmost	1
recesses	1
of	1
his	1
heart,	1
the	1
Knight	1
of	1
the	1
Grove	1
brought	1
his	1
lay	1
to	1
an	1
end,	1
and	1
shortly	1
afterwards	1
exclaimed	1
in	1
a	1
melancholy	1
and	1
piteous	1
voice,	1
“O	1
fairest	1
and	1
most	1
ungrateful	1
woman	1
on	1
earth!	1
What!	1
can	1
it	1
be,	1
most	1
serene	1
Casildea	1
de	1
Vandalia,	1
that	1
thou	1
wilt	1
suffer	1
this	1
thy	1
captive	1
knight	1
to	1
waste	1
away	1
and	1
perish	1
in	1
ceaseless	1
wanderings	1
and	1
rude	1
and	1
arduous	1
toils?	1
It	1
is	1
not	1
enough	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
compelled	1
all	1
the	1
knights	1
of	1
Navarre,	1
all	1
the	1
Leonese,	1
all	1
the	1
Tartesians,	1
all	1
the	1
Castilians,	1
and	1
finally	1
all	1
the	1
knights	1
of	1
La	1
Mancha,	1
to	1
confess	1
thee	1
the	1
most	1
beautiful	1
in	1
the	1
world?”	1
“Not	1
so,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
at	1
this,	1
“for	1
I	1
am	1
of	1
La	1
Mancha,	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
never	1
confessed	1
anything	1
of	1
the	1
sort,	1
nor	1
could	1
I	1
nor	1
should	1
I	1
confess	1
a	1
thing	1
so	1
much	1
to	1
the	1
prejudice	1
of	1
my	1
lady’s	1
beauty;	1
thou	1
seest	1
how	1
this	1
knight	1
is	1
raving,	1
Sancho.	1
But	1
let	1
us	1
listen,	1
perhaps	1
he	1
will	1
tell	1
us	1
more	1
about	1
himself.”	1
“That	1
he	1
will,”	1
returned	1
Sancho,	1
“for	1
he	1
seems	1
in	1
a	1
mood	1
to	1
bewail	1
himself	1
for	1
a	1
month	1
at	1
a	1
stretch.”	1
But	1
this	1
was	1
not	1
the	1
case,	1
for	1
the	1
Knight	1
of	1
the	1
Grove,	1
hearing	1
voices	1
near	1
him,	1
instead	1
of	1
continuing	1
his	1
lamentation,	1
stood	1
up	1
and	1
exclaimed	1
in	1
a	1
distinct	1
but	1
courteous	1
tone,	1
“Who	1
goes	1
there?	1
What	1
are	1
you?	1
Do	1
you	1
belong	1
to	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
the	1
happy	1
or	1
of	1
the	1
miserable?”	1
“Of	1
the	1
miserable,”	1
answered	1
Don	1
Quixote.	1
“Then	1
come	1
to	1
me,”	1
said	1
he	1
of	1
the	1
Grove,	1
“and	1
rest	1
assured	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
to	1
woe	1
itself	1
and	1
affliction	1
itself	1
you	1
come.”	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
finding	1
himself	1
answered	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
soft	1
and	1
courteous	1
manner,	1
went	1
over	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
so	1
did	1
Sancho.	1
The	1
doleful	1
knight	1
took	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
by	1
the	1
arm,	1
saying,	1
“Sit	1
down	1
here,	1
sir	1
knight;	1
for,	1
that	1
you	1
are	1
one,	1
and	1
of	1
those	1
that	1
profess	1
knight-errantry,	1
it	1
is	1
to	1
me	1
a	1
sufficient	1
proof	1
to	1
have	1
found	1
you	1
in	1
this	1
place,	1
where	1
solitude	1
and	1
night,	1
the	1
natural	1
couch	1
and	1
proper	1
retreat	1
of	1
knights-errant,	1
keep	1
you	1
company.”	1
To	1
which	1
Don	1
made	1
answer,	1
“A	1
knight	1
I	1
am	1
of	1
the	1
profession	1
you	1
mention,	1
and	1
though	1
sorrows,	1
misfortunes,	1
and	1
calamities	1
have	1
made	1
my	1
heart	1
their	1
abode,	1
the	1
compassion	1
I	1
feel	1
for	1
the	1
misfortunes	1
of	1
others	1
has	1
not	1
been	1
thereby	1
banished	1
from	1
it.	1
From	1
what	1
you	1
have	1
just	1
now	1
sung	1
I	1
gather	1
that	1
yours	1
spring	1
from	1
love,	1
I	1
mean	1
from	1
the	1
love	1
you	1
bear	1
that	1
fair	1
ingrate	1
you	1
named	1
in	1
your	1
lament.”	1
In	1
the	1
meantime,	1
they	1
had	1
seated	1
themselves	1
together	1
on	1
the	1
hard	1
ground	1
peaceably	1
and	1
sociably,	1
just	1
as	1
if,	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
day	1
broke,	1
they	1
were	1
not	1
going	1
to	1
break	1
one	1
another’s	1
heads.	1
“Are	1
you,	1
sir	1
knight,	1
in	1
love	1
perchance?”	1
asked	1
he	1
of	1
the	1
Grove	1
of	1
Don	1
Quixote.	1
“By	1
mischance	1
I	1
am,”	1
replied	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
“though	1
the	1
ills	1
arising	1
from	1
well-bestowed	1
affections	1
should	1
be	1
esteemed	1
favours	1
rather	1
than	1
misfortunes.”	1
“That	1
is	1
true,”	1
returned	1
he	1
of	1
the	1
Grove,	1
“if	1
scorn	1
did	1
not	1
unsettle	1
our	1
reason	1
and	1
understanding,	1
for	1
if	1
it	1
be	1
excessive	1
it	1
looks	1
like	1
revenge.”	1
“I	1
was	1
never	1
scorned	1
by	1
my	1
lady,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote.	1
“Certainly	1
not,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
who	1
stood	1
close	1
by,	1
“for	1
my	1
lady	1
is	1
as	1
a	1
lamb,	1
and	1
softer	1
than	1
a	1
roll	1
of	1
butter.”	1
“Is	1
this	1
your	1
squire?”	1
asked	1
he	1
of	1
the	1
Grove.	1
“He	1
is,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote.	1
“I	1
never	1
yet	1
saw	1
a	1
squire,”	1
said	1
he	1
of	1
the	1
Grove,	1
“who	1
ventured	1
to	1
speak	1
when	1
his	1
master	1
was	1
speaking;	1
at	1
least,	1
there	1
is	1
mine,	1
who	1
is	1
as	1
big	1
as	1
his	1
father,	1
and	1
it	1
cannot	1
be	1
proved	1
that	1
he	1
has	1
ever	1
opened	1
his	1
lips	1
when	1
I	1
am	1
speaking.”	1
“By	1
my	1
faith	1
then,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“I	1
have	1
spoken,	1
and	1
am	1
fit	1
to	1
speak,	1
in	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
one	1
as	1
much,	1
or	1
even—but	1
never	1
mind—it	1
only	1
makes	1
it	1
worse	1
to	1
stir	1
it.”	1
The	1
squire	1
of	1
the	1
Grove	1
took	1
Sancho	1
by	1
the	1
arm,	1
saying	1
to	1
him,	1
“Let	1
us	1
two	1
go	1
where	1
we	1
can	1
talk	1
in	1
squire	1
style	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
we	1
please,	1
and	1
leave	1
these	1
gentlemen	1
our	1
masters	1
to	1
fight	1
it	1
out	1
over	1
the	1
story	1
of	1
their	1
loves;	1
and,	1
depend	1
upon	1
it,	1
daybreak	1
will	1
find	1
them	1
at	1
it	1
without	1
having	1
made	1
an	1
end	1
of	1
it.”	1
“So	1
be	1
it	1
by	1
all	1
means,”	1
said	1
Sancho;	1
“and	1
I	1
will	1
tell	1
your	1
worship	1
who	1
I	1
am,	1
that	1
you	1
may	1
see	1
whether	1
I	1
am	1
to	1
be	1
reckoned	1
among	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
talkative	1
squires.”	1
With	1
this	1
the	1
two	1
squires	1
withdrew	1
to	1
one	1
side,	1
and	1
between	1
them	1
there	1
passed	1
a	1
conversation	1
as	1
droll	1
as	1
that	1
which	1
passed	1
between	1
their	1
masters	1
was	1
serious.	1

p13a.jpg	1

Full	1
Size	1
The	1
knights	1
and	1
the	1
squires	1
made	1
two	1
parties,	1
these	1
telling	1
the	1
story	1
of	1
their	1
lives,	1
the	1
others	1
the	1
story	1
of	1
their	1
loves;	1
but	1
the	1
history	1
relates	1
first	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
conversation	1
of	1
the	1
servants,	1
and	1
afterwards	1
takes	1
up	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
masters;	1
and	1
it	1
says	1
that,	1
withdrawing	1
a	1
little	1
from	1
the	1
others,	1
he	1
of	1
the	1
Grove	1
said	1
to	1
Sancho,	1
“A	1
hard	1
life	1
it	1
is	1
we	1
lead	1
and	1
live,	1
señor,	1
we	1
that	1
are	1
squires	1
to	1
knights-errant;	1
verily,	1
we	1
eat	1
our	1
bread	1
in	1
the	1
sweat	1
of	1
our	1
faces,	1
which	1
is	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
curses	1
God	1
laid	1
on	1
our	1
first	1
parents.”	1
“It	1
may	1
be	1
said,	1
too,”	1
added	1
Sancho,	1
“that	1
we	1
eat	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
chill	1
of	1
our	1
bodies;	1
for	1
who	1
gets	1
more	1
heat	1
and	1
cold	1
than	1
the	1
miserable	1
squires	1
of	1
knight-errantry?	1
Even	1
so	1
it	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
so	1
bad	1
if	1
we	1
had	1
something	1
to	1
eat,	1
for	1
woes	1
are	1
lighter	1
if	1
there’s	1
bread;	1
but	1
sometimes	1
we	1
go	1
a	1
day	1
or	1
two	1
without	1
breaking	1
our	1
fast,	1
except	1
with	1
the	1
wind	1
that	1
blows.”	1
“All	1
that,”	1
said	1
he	1
of	1
the	1
Grove,	1
“may	1
be	1
endured	1
and	1
put	1
up	1
with	1
when	1
we	1
have	1
hopes	1
of	1
reward;	1
for,	1
unless	1
the	1
knight-errant	1
he	1
serves	1
is	1
excessively	1
unlucky,	1
after	1
a	1
few	1
turns	1
the	1
squire	1
will	1
at	1
least	1
find	1
himself	1
rewarded	1
with	1
a	1
fine	1
government	1
of	1
some	1
island	1
or	1
some	1
fair	1
county.”	1
“I,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“have	1
already	1
told	1
my	1
master	1
that	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
content	1
with	1
the	1
government	1
of	1
some	1
island,	1
and	1
he	1
is	1
so	1
noble	1
and	1
generous	1
that	1
he	1
has	1
promised	1
it	1
to	1
me	1
ever	1
so	1
many	1
times.”	1
“I,”	1
said	1
he	1
of	1
the	1
Grove,	1
“shall	1
be	1
satisfied	1
with	1
a	1
canonry	1
for	1
my	1
services,	1
and	1
my	1
master	1
has	1
already	1
assigned	1
me	1
one.”	1
“Your	1
master,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“no	1
doubt	1
is	1
a	1
knight	1
in	1
the	1
Church	1
line,	1
and	1
can	1
bestow	1
rewards	1
of	1
that	1
sort	1
on	1
his	1
good	1
squire;	1
but	1
mine	1
is	1
only	1
a	1
layman;	1
though	1
I	1
remember	1
some	1
clever,	1
but,	1
to	1
my	1
mind,	1
designing	1
people,	1
strove	1
to	1
persuade	1
him	1
to	1
try	1
and	1
become	1
an	1
archbishop.	1
He,	1
however,	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
anything	1
but	1
an	1
emperor;	1
but	1
I	1
was	1
trembling	1
all	1
the	1
time	1
lest	1
he	1
should	1
take	1
a	1
fancy	1
to	1
go	1
into	1
the	1
Church,	1
not	1
finding	1
myself	1
fit	1
to	1
hold	1
office	1
in	1
it;	1
for	1
I	1
may	1
tell	1
you,	1
though	1
I	1
seem	1
a	1
man,	1
I	1
am	1
no	1
better	1
than	1
a	1
beast	1
for	1
the	1
Church.”	1
“Well,	1
then,	1
you	1
are	1
wrong	1
there,”	1
said	1
he	1
of	1
the	1
Grove;	1
“for	1
those	1
island	1
governments	1
are	1
not	1
all	1
satisfactory;	1
some	1
are	1
awkward,	1
some	1
are	1
poor,	1
some	1
are	1
dull,	1
and,	1
in	1
short,	1
the	1
highest	1
and	1
choicest	1
brings	1
with	1
it	1
a	1
heavy	1
burden	1
of	1
cares	1
and	1
troubles	1
which	1
the	1
unhappy	1
wight	1
to	1
whose	1
lot	1
it	1
has	1
fallen	1
bears	1
upon	1
his	1
shoulders.	1
Far	1
better	1
would	1
it	1
be	1
for	1
us	1
who	1
have	1
adopted	1
this	1
accursed	1
service	1
to	1
go	1
back	1
to	1
our	1
own	1
houses,	1
and	1
there	1
employ	1
ourselves	1
in	1
pleasanter	1
occupations—in	1
hunting	1
or	1
fishing,	1
for	1
instance;	1
for	1
what	1
squire	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
is	1
there	1
so	1
poor	1
as	1
not	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
hack	1
and	1
a	1
couple	1
of	1
greyhounds	1
and	1
a	1
fishingrod	1
to	1
amuse	1
himself	1
with	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
village?”	1
“I	1
am	1
not	1
in	1
want	1
of	1
any	1
of	1
those	1
things,”	1
said	1
Sancho;	1
“to	1
be	1
sure	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
hack,	1
but	1
I	1
have	1
an	1
ass	1
that	1
is	1
worth	1
my	1
master’s	1
horse	1
twice	1
over;	1
God	1
send	1
me	1
a	1
bad	1
Easter,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
next	1
one	1
I	1
am	1
to	1
see,	1
if	1
I	1
would	1
swap,	1
even	1
if	1
I	1
got	1
four	1
bushels	1
of	1
barley	1
to	1
boot.	1
You	1
will	1
laugh	1
at	1
the	1
value	1
I	1
put	1
on	1
my	1
Dapple—for	1
dapple	1
is	1
the	1
colour	1
of	1
my	1
beast.	1
As	1
to	1
greyhounds,	1
I	1
can’t	1
want	1
for	1
them,	1
for	1
there	1
are	1
enough	1
and	1
to	1
spare	1
in	1
my	1
town;	1
and,	1
moreover,	1
there	1
is	1
more	1
pleasure	1
in	1
sport	1
when	1
it	1
is	1
at	1
other	1
people’s	1
expense.”	1
“In	1
truth	1
and	1
earnest,	1
sir	1
squire,”	1
said	1
he	1
of	1
the	1
Grove,	1
“I	1
have	1
made	1
up	1
my	1
mind	1
and	1
determined	1
to	1
have	1
done	1
with	1
these	1
drunken	1
vagaries	1
of	1
these	1
knights,	1
and	1
go	1
back	1
to	1
my	1
village,	1
and	1
bring	1
up	1
my	1
children;	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
three,	1
like	1
three	1
Oriental	1
pearls.”	1
“I	1
have	1
two,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“that	1
might	1
be	1
presented	1
before	1
the	1
Pope	1
himself,	1
especially	1
a	1
girl	1
whom	1
I	1
am	1
breeding	1
up	1
for	1
a	1
countess,	1
please	1
God,	1
though	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
her	1
mother.”	1
“And	1
how	1
old	1
is	1
this	1
lady	1
that	1
is	1
being	1
bred	1
up	1
for	1
a	1
countess?”	1
asked	1
he	1
of	1
the	1
Grove.	1
“Fifteen,	1
a	1
couple	1
of	1
years	1
more	1
or	1
less,”	1
answered	1
Sancho;	1
“but	1
she	1
is	1
as	1
tall	1
as	1
a	1
lance,	1
and	1
as	1
fresh	1
as	1
an	1
April	1
morning,	1
and	1
as	1
strong	1
as	1
a	1
porter.”	1
“Those	1
are	1
gifts	1
to	1
fit	1
her	1
to	1
be	1
not	1
only	1
a	1
countess	1
but	1
a	1
nymph	1
of	1
the	1
greenwood,”	1
said	1
he	1
of	1
the	1
Grove;	1
“whoreson	1
strumpet!	1
what	1
pith	1
the	1
rogue	1
must	1
have!”	1
To	1
which	1
Sancho	1
made	1
answer,	1
somewhat	1
sulkily,	1
“She’s	1
no	1
strumpet,	1
nor	1
was	1
her	1
mother,	1
nor	1
will	1
either	1
of	1
them	1
be,	1
please	1
God,	1
while	1
I	1
live;	1
speak	1
more	1
civilly;	1
for	1
one	1
bred	1
up	1
among	1
knights-errant,	1
who	1
are	1
courtesy	1
itself,	1
your	1
words	1
don’t	1
seem	1
to	1
me	1
to	1
be	1
very	1
becoming.”	1
“O	1
how	1
little	1
you	1
know	1
about	1
compliments,	1
sir	1
squire,”	1
returned	1
he	1
of	1
the	1
Grove.	1
“What!	1
don’t	1
you	1
know	1
that	1
when	1
a	1
horseman	1
delivers	1
a	1
good	1
lance	1
thrust	1
at	1
the	1
bull	1
in	1
the	1
plaza,	1
or	1
when	1
anyone	1
does	1
anything	1
very	1
well,	1
the	1
people	1
are	1
wont	1
to	1
say,	1
‘Ha,	1
whoreson	1
rip!	1
how	1
well	1
he	1
has	1
done	1
it!’	1
and	1
that	1
what	1
seems	1
to	1
be	1
abuse	1
in	1
the	1
expression	1
is	1
high	1
praise?	1
Disown	1
sons	1
and	1
daughters,	1
señor,	1
who	1
don’t	1
do	1
what	1
deserves	1
that	1
compliments	1
of	1
this	1
sort	1
should	1
be	1
paid	1
to	1
their	1
parents.”	1
“I	1
do	1
disown	1
them,”	1
replied	1
Sancho,	1
“and	1
in	1
this	1
way,	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
same	1
reasoning,	1
you	1
might	1
call	1
me	1
and	1
my	1
children	1
and	1
my	1
wife	1
all	1
the	1
strumpets	1
in	1
the	1
world,	1
for	1
all	1
they	1
do	1
and	1
say	1
is	1
of	1
a	1
kind	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
highest	1
degree	1
deserves	1
the	1
same	1
praise;	1
and	1
to	1
see	1
them	1
again	1
I	1
pray	1
God	1
to	1
deliver	1
me	1
from	1
mortal	1
sin,	1
or,	1
what	1
comes	1
to	1
the	1
same	1
thing,	1
to	1
deliver	1
me	1
from	1
this	1
perilous	1
calling	1
of	1
squire	1
into	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
fallen	1
a	1
second	1
time,	1
decayed	1
and	1
beguiled	1
by	1
a	1
purse	1
with	1
a	1
hundred	1
ducats	1
that	1
I	1
found	1
one	1
day	1
in	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
the	1
Sierra	1
Morena;	1
and	1
the	1
devil	1
is	1
always	1
putting	1
a	1
bag	1
full	1
of	1
doubloons	1
before	1
my	1
eyes,	1
here,	1
there,	1
everywhere,	1
until	1
I	1
fancy	1
at	1
every	1
stop	1
I	1
am	1
putting	1
my	1
hand	1
on	1
it,	1
and	1
hugging	1
it,	1
and	1
carrying	1
it	1
home	1
with	1
me,	1
and	1
making	1
investments,	1
and	1
getting	1
interest,	1
and	1
living	1
like	1
a	1
prince;	1
and	1
so	1
long	1
as	1
I	1
think	1
of	1
this	1
I	1
make	1
light	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
hardships	1
I	1
endure	1
with	1
this	1
simpleton	1
of	1
a	1
master	1
of	1
mine,	1
who,	1
I	1
well	1
know,	1
is	1
more	1
of	1
a	1
madman	1
than	1
a	1
knight.”	1
“There’s	1
why	1
they	1
say	1
that	1
‘covetousness	1
bursts	1
the	1
bag,’”	1
said	1
he	1
of	1
the	1
Grove;	1
“but	1
if	1
you	1
come	1
to	1
talk	1
of	1
that	1
sort,	1
there	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
greater	1
one	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
than	1
my	1
master,	1
for	1
he	1
is	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
of	1
whom	1
they	1
say,	1
‘the	1
cares	1
of	1
others	1
kill	1
the	1
ass;’	1
for,	1
in	1
order	1
that	1
another	1
knight	1
may	1
recover	1
the	1
senses	1
he	1
has	1
lost,	1
he	1
makes	1
a	1
madman	1
of	1
himself	1
and	1
goes	1
looking	1
for	1
what,	1
when	1
found,	1
may,	1
for	1
all	1
I	1
know,	1
fly	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
face.”	1
“And	1
is	1
he	1
in	1
love	1
perchance?”	1
asked	1
Sancho.	1
“He	1
is,”	1
said	1
of	1
the	1
Grove,	1
“with	1
one	1
Casildea	1
de	1
Vandalia,	1
the	1
rawest	1
and	1
best	1
roasted	1
lady	1
the	1
whole	1
world	1
could	1
produce;	1
but	1
that	1
rawness	1
is	1
not	1
the	1
only	1
foot	1
he	1
limps	1
on,	1
for	1
he	1
has	1
greater	1
schemes	1
rumbling	1
in	1
his	1
bowels,	1
as	1
will	1
be	1
seen	1
before	1
many	1
hours	1
are	1
over.”	1
“There’s	1
no	1
road	1
so	1
smooth	1
but	1
it	1
has	1
some	1
hole	1
or	1
hindrance	1
in	1
it,”	1
said	1
Sancho;	1
“in	1
other	1
houses	1
they	1
cook	1
beans,	1
but	1
in	1
mine	1
it’s	1
by	1
the	1
potful;	1
madness	1
will	1
have	1
more	1
followers	1
and	1
hangers-on	1
than	1
sound	1
sense;	1
but	1
if	1
there	1
be	1
any	1
truth	1
in	1
the	1
common	1
saying,	1
that	1
to	1
have	1
companions	1
in	1
trouble	1
gives	1
some	1
relief,	1
I	1
may	1
take	1
consolation	1
from	1
you,	1
inasmuch	1
as	1
you	1
serve	1
a	1
master	1
as	1
crazy	1
as	1
my	1
own.”	1
“Crazy	1
but	1
valiant,”	1
replied	1
he	1
of	1
the	1
Grove,	1
“and	1
more	1
roguish	1
than	1
crazy	1
or	1
valiant.”	1
“Mine	1
is	1
not	1
that,”	1
said	1
Sancho;	1
“I	1
mean	1
he	1
has	1
nothing	1
of	1
the	1
rogue	1
in	1
him;	1
on	1
the	1
contrary,	1
he	1
has	1
the	1
soul	1
of	1
a	1
pitcher;	1
he	1
has	1
no	1
thought	1
of	1
doing	1
harm	1
to	1
anyone,	1
only	1
good	1
to	1
all,	1
nor	1
has	1
he	1
any	1
malice	1
whatever	1
in	1
him;	1
a	1
child	1
might	1
persuade	1
him	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
night	1
at	1
noonday;	1
and	1
for	1
this	1
simplicity	1
I	1
love	1
him	1
as	1
the	1
core	1
of	1
my	1
heart,	1
and	1
I	1
can’t	1
bring	1
myself	1
to	1
leave	1
him,	1
let	1
him	1
do	1
ever	1
such	1
foolish	1
things.”	1
“For	1
all	1
that,	1
brother	1
and	1
señor,”	1
said	1
he	1
of	1
the	1
Grove,	1
“if	1
the	1
blind	1
lead	1
the	1
blind,	1
both	1
are	1
in	1
danger	1
of	1
falling	1
into	1
the	1
pit.	1
It	1
is	1
better	1
for	1
us	1
to	1
beat	1
a	1
quiet	1
retreat	1
and	1
get	1
back	1
to	1
our	1
own	1
quarters;	1
for	1
those	1
who	1
seek	1
adventures	1
don’t	1
always	1
find	1
good	1
ones.”	1
Sancho	1
kept	1
spitting	1
from	1
time	1
to	1
time,	1
and	1
his	1
spittle	1
seemed	1
somewhat	1
ropy	1
and	1
dry,	1
observing	1
which	1
the	1
compassionate	1
squire	1
of	1
the	1
Grove	1
said,	1
“It	1
seems	1
to	1
me	1
that	1
with	1
all	1
this	1
talk	1
of	1
ours	1
our	1
tongues	1
are	1
sticking	1
to	1
the	1
roofs	1
of	1
our	1
mouths;	1
but	1
I	1
have	1
a	1
pretty	1
good	1
loosener	1
hanging	1
from	1
the	1
saddle-bow	1
of	1
my	1
horse,”	1
and	1
getting	1
up	1
he	1
came	1
back	1
the	1
next	1
minute	1
with	1
a	1
large	1
bota	1
of	1
wine	1
and	1
a	1
pasty	1
half	1
a	1
yard	1
across;	1
and	1
this	1
is	1
no	1
exaggeration,	1
for	1
it	1
was	1
made	1
of	1
a	1
house	1
rabbit	1
so	1
big	1
that	1
Sancho,	1
as	1
he	1
handled	1
it,	1
took	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
made	1
of	1
a	1
goat,	1
not	1
to	1
say	1
a	1
kid,	1
and	1
looking	1
at	1
it	1
he	1
said,	1
“And	1
do	1
you	1
carry	1
this	1
with	1
you,	1
señor?”	1
“Why,	1
what	1
are	1
you	1
thinking	1
about?”	1
said	1
the	1
other;	1
“do	1
you	1
take	1
me	1
for	1
some	1
paltry	1
squire?	1
I	1
carry	1
a	1
better	1
larder	1
on	1
my	1
horse’s	1
croup	1
than	1
a	1
general	1
takes	1
with	1
him	1
when	1
he	1
goes	1
on	1
a	1
march.”	1
Sancho	1
ate	1
without	1
requiring	1
to	1
be	1
pressed,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
dark	1
bolted	1
mouthfuls	1
like	1
the	1
knots	1
on	1
a	1
tether,	1
and	1
said	1
he,	1
“You	1
are	1
a	1
proper	1
trusty	1
squire,	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
right	1
sort,	1
sumptuous	1
and	1
grand,	1
as	1
this	1
banquet	1
shows,	1
which,	1
if	1
it	1
has	1
not	1
come	1
here	1
by	1
magic	1
art,	1
at	1
any	1
rate	1
has	1
the	1
look	1
of	1
it;	1
not	1
like	1
me,	1
unlucky	1
beggar,	1
that	1
have	1
nothing	1
more	1
in	1
my	1
alforjas	1
than	1
a	1
scrap	1
of	1
cheese,	1
so	1
hard	1
that	1
one	1
might	1
brain	1
a	1
giant	1
with	1
it,	1
and,	1
to	1
keep	1
it	1
company,	1
a	1
few	1
dozen	1
carobs	1
and	1
as	1
many	1
more	1
filberts	1
and	1
walnuts;	1
thanks	1
to	1
the	1
austerity	1
of	1
my	1
master,	1
and	1
the	1
idea	1
he	1
has	1
and	1
the	1
rule	1
he	1
follows,	1
that	1
knights-errant	1
must	1
not	1
live	1
or	1
sustain	1
themselves	1
on	1
anything	1
except	1
dried	1
fruits	1
and	1
the	1
herbs	1
of	1
the	1
field.”	1
“By	1
my	1
faith,	1
brother,”	1
said	1
he	1
of	1
the	1
Grove,	1
“my	1
stomach	1
is	1
not	1
made	1
for	1
thistles,	1
or	1
wild	1
pears,	1
or	1
roots	1
of	1
the	1
woods;	1
let	1
our	1
masters	1
do	1
as	1
they	1
like,	1
with	1
their	1
chivalry	1
notions	1
and	1
laws,	1
and	1
eat	1
what	1
those	1
enjoin;	1
I	1
carry	1
my	1
prog-basket	1
and	1
this	1
bota	1
hanging	1
to	1
the	1
saddle-bow,	1
whatever	1
they	1
may	1
say;	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
such	1
an	1
object	1
of	1
worship	1
with	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
love	1
it	1
so,	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
hardly	1
a	1
moment	1
but	1
I	1
am	1
kissing	1
and	1
embracing	1
it	1
over	1
and	1
over	1
again;”	1
and	1
so	1
saying	1
he	1
thrust	1
it	1
into	1
Sancho’s	1
hands,	1
who	1
raising	1
it	1
aloft	1
pointed	1
to	1
his	1
mouth,	1
gazed	1
at	1
the	1
stars	1
for	1
a	1
quarter	1
of	1
an	1
hour;	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
drinking	1
let	1
his	1
head	1
fall	1
on	1
one	1
side,	1
and	1
giving	1
a	1
deep	1
sigh,	1
exclaimed,	1
“Ah,	1
whoreson	1
rogue,	1
how	1
catholic	1
it	1
is!”	1
“There,	1
you	1
see,”	1
said	1
he	1
of	1
the	1
Grove,	1
hearing	1
Sancho’s	1
exclamation,	1
“how	1
you	1
have	1
called	1
this	1
wine	1
whoreson	1
by	1
way	1
of	1
praise.”	1
“Well,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“I	1
own	1
it,	1
and	1
I	1
grant	1
it	1
is	1
no	1
dishonour	1
to	1
call	1
anyone	1
whoreson	1
when	1
it	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
understood	1
as	1
praise.	1
But	1
tell	1
me,	1
señor,	1
by	1
what	1
you	1
love	1
best,	1
is	1
this	1
Ciudad	1
Real	1
wine?”	1
“O	1
rare	1
wine-taster!”	1
said	1
he	1
of	1
the	1
Grove;	1
“nowhere	1
else	1
indeed	1
does	1
it	1
come	1
from,	1
and	1
it	1
has	1
some	1
years’	1
age	1
too.”	1
“Leave	1
me	1
alone	1
for	1
that,”	1
said	1
Sancho;	1
“never	1
fear	1
but	1
I’ll	1
hit	1
upon	1
the	1
place	1
it	1
came	1
from	1
somehow.	1
What	1
would	1
you	1
say,	1
sir	1
squire,	1
to	1
my	1
having	1
such	1
a	1
great	1
natural	1
instinct	1
in	1
judging	1
wines	1
that	1
you	1
have	1
only	1
to	1
let	1
me	1
smell	1
one	1
and	1
I	1
can	1
tell	1
positively	1
its	1
country,	1
its	1
kind,	1
its	1
flavour	1
and	1
soundness,	1
the	1
changes	1
it	1
will	1
undergo,	1
and	1
everything	1
that	1
appertains	1
to	1
a	1
wine?	1
But	1
it	1
is	1
no	1
wonder,	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
had	1
in	1
my	1
family,	1
on	1
my	1
father’s	1
side,	1
the	1
two	1
best	1
wine-tasters	1
that	1
have	1
been	1
known	1
in	1
La	1
Mancha	1
for	1
many	1
a	1
long	1
year,	1
and	1
to	1
prove	1
it	1
I’ll	1
tell	1
you	1
now	1
a	1
thing	1
that	1
happened	1
them.	1
They	1
gave	1
the	1
two	1
of	1
them	1
some	1
wine	1
out	1
of	1
a	1
cask,	1
to	1
try,	1
asking	1
their	1
opinion	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
condition,	1
quality,	1
goodness	1
or	1
badness	1
of	1
the	1
wine.	1
One	1
of	1
them	1
tried	1
it	1
with	1
the	1
tip	1
of	1
his	1
tongue,	1
the	1
other	1
did	1
no	1
more	1
than	1
bring	1
it	1
to	1
his	1
nose.	1
The	1
first	1
said	1
the	1
wine	1
had	1
a	1
flavour	1
of	1
iron,	1
the	1
second	1
said	1
it	1
had	1
a	1
stronger	1
flavour	1
of	1
cordovan.	1
The	1
owner	1
said	1
the	1
cask	1
was	1
clean,	1
and	1
that	1
nothing	1
had	1
been	1
added	1
to	1
the	1
wine	1
from	1
which	1
it	1
could	1
have	1
got	1
a	1
flavour	1
of	1
either	1
iron	1
or	1
leather.	1
Nevertheless,	1
these	1
two	1
great	1
wine-tasters	1
held	1
to	1
what	1
they	1
had	1
said.	1
Time	1
went	1
by,	1
the	1
wine	1
was	1
sold,	1
and	1
when	1
they	1
came	1
to	1
clean	1
out	1
the	1
cask,	1
they	1
found	1
in	1
it	1
a	1
small	1
key	1
hanging	1
to	1
a	1
thong	1
of	1
cordovan;	1
see	1
now	1
if	1
one	1
who	1
comes	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
stock	1
has	1
not	1
a	1
right	1
to	1
give	1
his	1
opinion	1
in	1
such	1
like	1
cases.”	1
“Therefore,	1
I	1
say,”	1
said	1
he	1
of	1
the	1
Grove,	1
“let	1
us	1
give	1
up	1
going	1
in	1
quest	1
of	1
adventures,	1
and	1
as	1
we	1
have	1
loaves	1
let	1
us	1
not	1
go	1
looking	1
for	1
cakes,	1
but	1
return	1
to	1
our	1
cribs,	1
for	1
God	1
will	1
find	1
us	1
there	1
if	1
it	1
be	1
his	1
will.”	1
“Until	1
my	1
master	1
reaches	1
Saragossa,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“I’ll	1
remain	1
in	1
his	1
service;	1
after	1
that	1
we’ll	1
see.”	1
The	1
end	1
of	1
it	1
was	1
that	1
the	1
two	1
squires	1
talked	1
so	1
much	1
and	1
drank	1
so	1
much	1
that	1
sleep	1
had	1
to	1
tie	1
their	1
tongues	1
and	1
moderate	1
their	1
thirst,	1
for	1
to	1
quench	1
it	1
was	1
impossible;	1
and	1
so	1
the	1
pair	1
of	1
them	1
fell	1
asleep	1
clinging	1
to	1
the	1
now	1
nearly	1
empty	1
bota	1
and	1
with	1
half-chewed	1
morsels	1
in	1
their	1
mouths;	1
and	1
there	1
we	1
will	1
leave	1
them	1
for	1
the	1
present,	1
to	1
relate	1
what	1
passed	1
between	1
the	1
Knight	1
of	1
the	1
Grove	1
and	1
him	1
of	1
the	1
Rueful	1
Countenance.	1

Among	1
the	1

passed	1
between	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
and	1
the	1
Knight	1
of	1
the	1
Wood,	1
the	1
history	1
tells	1
us	1
he	1
of	1
the	1
Grove	1
said	1
to	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“In	1
fine,	1
sir	1
knight,	1
I	1
would	1
have	1
you	1
know	1
that	1
my	1
destiny,	1
or,	1
more	1
properly	1
speaking,	1
my	1
choice	1
led	1
me	1
to	1
fall	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
the	1
peerless	1
Casildea	1
de	1
Vandalia.	1
I	1
call	1
her	1
peerless	1
because	1
she	1
has	1
no	1
peer,	1
whether	1
it	1
be	1
in	1
bodily	1
stature	1
or	1
in	1
the	1
supremacy	1
of	1
rank	1
and	1
beauty.	1
This	1
same	1
Casildea,	1
then,	1
that	1
I	1
speak	1
of,	1
requited	1
my	1
honourable	1
passion	1
and	1
gentle	1
aspirations	1
by	1
compelling	1
me,	1
as	1
his	1
stepmother	1
did	1
Hercules,	1
to	1
engage	1
in	1
many	1
perils	1
of	1
various	1
sorts,	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
each	1
promising	1
me	1
that,	1
with	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
next,	1
the	1
object	1
of	1
my	1
hopes	1
should	1
be	1
attained;	1
but	1
my	1
labours	1
have	1
gone	1
on	1
increasing	1
link	1
by	1
link	1
until	1
they	1
are	1
past	1
counting,	1
nor	1
do	1
I	1
know	1
what	1
will	1
be	1
the	1
last	1
one	1
that	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
the	1
accomplishment	1
of	1
my	1
chaste	1
desires.	1
On	1
one	1
occasion	1
she	1
bade	1
me	1
go	1
and	1
challenge	1
the	1
famous	1
giantess	1
of	1
Seville,	1
La	1
Giralda	1
by	1
name,	1
who	1
is	1
as	1
mighty	1
and	1
strong	1
as	1
if	1
made	1
of	1
brass,	1
and	1
though	1
never	1
stirring	1
from	1
one	1
spot,	1
is	1
the	1
most	1
restless	1
and	1
changeable	1
woman	1
in	1
the	1
world.	1
I	1
came,	1
I	1
saw,	1
I	1
conquered,	1
and	1
I	1
made	1
her	1
stay	1
quiet	1
and	1
behave	1
herself,	1
for	1
nothing	1
but	1
north	1
winds	1
blew	1
for	1
more	1
than	1
a	1
week.	1
Another	1
time	1
I	1
was	1
ordered	1
to	1
lift	1
those	1
ancient	1
stones,	1
the	1
mighty	1
bulls	1
of	1
Guisando,	1
an	1
enterprise	1
that	1
might	1
more	1
fitly	1
be	1
entrusted	1
to	1
porters	1
than	1
to	1
knights.	1
Again,	1
she	1
bade	1
me	1
fling	1
myself	1
into	1
the	1
cavern	1
of	1
Cabra—an	1
unparalleled	1
and	1
awful	1
peril—and	1
bring	1
her	1
a	1
minute	1
account	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
is	1
concealed	1
in	1
those	1
gloomy	1
depths.	1
I	1
stopped	1
the	1
motion	1
of	1
the	1
Giralda,	1
I	1
lifted	1
the	1
bulls	1
of	1
Guisando,	1
I	1
flung	1
myself	1
into	1
the	1
cavern	1
and	1
brought	1
to	1
light	1
the	1
secrets	1
of	1
its	1
abyss;	1
and	1
my	1
hopes	1
are	1
as	1
dead	1
as	1
dead	1
can	1
be,	1
and	1
her	1
scorn	1
and	1
her	1
commands	1
as	1
lively	1
as	1
ever.	1
To	1
be	1
brief,	1
last	1
of	1
all	1
she	1
has	1
commanded	1
me	1
to	1
go	1
through	1
all	1
the	1
provinces	1
of	1
Spain	1
and	1
compel	1
all	1
the	1
knights-errant	1
wandering	1
therein	1
to	1
confess	1
that	1
she	1
surpasses	1
all	1
women	1
alive	1
to-day	1
in	1
beauty,	1
and	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
most	1
valiant	1
and	1
the	1
most	1
deeply	1
enamoured	1
knight	1
on	1
earth;	1
in	1
support	1
of	1
which	1
claim	1
I	1
have	1
already	1
travelled	1
over	1
the	1
greater	1
part	1
of	1
Spain,	1
and	1
have	1
there	1
vanquished	1
several	1
knights	1
who	1
have	1
dared	1
to	1
contradict	1
me;	1
but	1
what	1
I	1
most	1
plume	1
and	1
pride	1
myself	1
upon	1
is	1
having	1
vanquished	1
in	1
single	1
combat	1
that	1
so	1
famous	1
knight	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
of	1
La	1
Mancha,	1
and	1
made	1
him	1
confess	1
that	1
my	1
Casildea	1
is	1
more	1
beautiful	1
than	1
his	1
Dulcinea;	1
and	1
in	1
this	1
one	1
victory	1
I	1
hold	1
myself	1
to	1
have	1
conquered	1
all	1
the	1
knights	1
in	1
the	1
world;	1
for	1
this	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
that	1
I	1
speak	1
of	1
has	1
vanquished	1
them	1
all,	1
and	1
I	1
having	1
vanquished	1
him,	1
his	1
glory,	1
his	1
fame,	1
and	1
his	1
honour	1
have	1
passed	1
and	1
are	1
transferred	1
to	1
my	1
person;	1
for	1
The	1
more	1
the	1
vanquished	1
hath	1
of	1
fair	1
renown,	1
The	1
greater	1
glory	1
gilds	1
the	1
victor’s	1
crown.	1
Thus	1
the	1
innumerable	1
achievements	1
of	1
the	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
are	1
now	1
set	1
down	1
to	1
my	1
account	1
and	1
have	1
become	1
mine.”	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
was	1
amazed	1
when	1
he	1
heard	1
the	1
Knight	1
of	1
the	1
Grove,	1
and	1
was	1
a	1
thousand	1
times	1
on	1
the	1
point	1
of	1
telling	1
him	1
he	1
lied,	1
and	1
had	1
the	1
lie	1
direct	1
already	1
on	1
the	1
tip	1
of	1
his	1
tongue;	1
but	1
he	1
restrained	1
himself	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
he	1
could,	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
force	1
him	1
to	1
confess	1
the	1
lie	1
with	1
his	1
own	1
lips;	1
so	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
him	1
quietly,	1
“As	1
to	1
what	1
you	1
say,	1
sir	1
knight,	1
about	1
having	1
vanquished	1
most	1
of	1
the	1
knights	1
of	1
Spain,	1
or	1
even	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
world,	1
I	1
say	1
nothing;	1
but	1
that	1
you	1
have	1
vanquished	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
of	1
La	1
Mancha	1
I	1
consider	1
doubtful;	1
it	1
may	1
have	1
been	1
some	1
other	1
that	1
resembled	1
him,	1
although	1
there	1
are	1
few	1
like	1
him.”	1
“How!	1
not	1
vanquished?”	1
said	1
he	1
of	1
the	1
Grove;	1
“by	1
the	1
heaven	1
that	1
is	1
above	1
us	1
I	1
fought	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
and	1
overcame	1
him	1
and	1
made	1
him	1
yield;	1
and	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
tall	1
stature,	1
gaunt	1
features,	1
long,	1
lank	1
limbs,	1
with	1
hair	1
turning	1
grey,	1
an	1
aquiline	1
nose	1
rather	1
hooked,	1
and	1
large	1
black	1
drooping	1
moustaches;	1
he	1
does	1
battle	1
under	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
‘The	1
Countenance,’	1
and	1
he	1
has	1
for	1
squire	1
a	1
peasant	1
called	1
Sancho	1
Panza;	1
he	1
presses	1
the	1
loins	1
and	1
rules	1
the	1
reins	1
of	1
a	1
famous	1
steed	1
called	1
Rocinante;	1
and	1
lastly,	1
he	1
has	1
for	1
the	1
mistress	1
of	1
his	1
will	1
a	1
certain	1
Dulcinea	1
del	1
Toboso,	1
once	1
upon	1
a	1
time	1
called	1
Aldonza	1
Lorenzo,	1
just	1
as	1
I	1
call	1
mine	1
Casildea	1
de	1
Vandalia	1
because	1
her	1
name	1
is	1
Casilda	1
and	1
she	1
is	1
of	1
Andalusia.	1
If	1
all	1
these	1
tokens	1
are	1
not	1
enough	1
to	1
vindicate	1
the	1
truth	1
of	1
what	1
I	1
say,	1
here	1
is	1
my	1
sword,	1
that	1
will	1
compel	1
incredulity	1
itself	1
to	1
give	1
credence	1
to	1
it.”	1
“Calm	1
yourself,	1
sir	1
knight,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“and	1
give	1
ear	1
to	1
what	1
I	1
am	1
about	1
to	1
say	1
to	1
you.	1
I	1
would	1
have	1
you	1
know	1
that	1
this	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
you	1
speak	1
of	1
is	1
the	1
greatest	1
friend	1
I	1
have	1
in	1
the	1
world;	1
so	1
much	1
so	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
say	1
I	1
regard	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
light	1
as	1
my	1
own	1
person;	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
precise	1
and	1
clear	1
indications	1
you	1
have	1
given	1
I	1
cannot	1
but	1
think	1
that	1
he	1
must	1
be	1
the	1
very	1
one	1
you	1
have	1
vanquished.	1
On	1
the	1
other	1
hand,	1
I	1
see	1
with	1
my	1
eyes	1
and	1
feel	1
with	1
my	1
hands	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
impossible	1
it	1
can	1
have	1
been	1
the	1
same;	1
unless	1
indeed	1
it	1
be	1
that,	1
as	1
he	1
has	1
many	1
enemies	1
who	1
are	1
enchanters,	1
and	1
one	1
in	1
particular	1
who	1
is	1
always	1
persecuting	1
him,	1
someone	1
of	1
these	1
may	1
have	1
taken	1
his	1
shape	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
allow	1
himself	1
to	1
be	1
vanquished,	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
defraud	1
him	1
of	1
the	1
fame	1
that	1
his	1
exalted	1
achievements	1
as	1
a	1
knight	1
have	1
earned	1
and	1
acquired	1
for	1
him	1
throughout	1
the	1
known	1
world.	1
And	1
in	1
confirmation	1
of	1
this,	1
I	1
must	1
tell	1
you,	1
too,	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
but	1
ten	1
hours	1
since	1
these	1
said	1
enchanters	1
his	1
enemies	1
transformed	1
the	1
shape	1
and	1
person	1
of	1
the	1
fair	1
Dulcinea	1
del	1
Toboso	1
into	1
a	1
foul	1
and	1
mean	1
village	1
lass,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
way	1
they	1
must	1
have	1
transformed	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
and	1
if	1
all	1
this	1
does	1
not	1
suffice	1
to	1
convince	1
you	1
of	1
the	1
truth	1
of	1
what	1
I	1
say,	1
here	1
is	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
himself,	1
who	1
will	1
maintain	1
it	1
by	1
arms,	1
on	1
foot	1
or	1
on	1
horseback	1
or	1
in	1
any	1
way	1
you	1
please.”	1
And	1
so	1
saying	1
he	1
stood	1
up	1
and	1
laid	1
his	1
hand	1
on	1
his	1
sword,	1
waiting	1
to	1
see	1
what	1
the	1
Knight	1
of	1
the	1
Grove	1
would	1
do,	1
who	1
in	1
an	1
equally	1
calm	1
voice	1
said	1
in	1
reply,	1
“Pledges	1
don’t	1
distress	1
a	1
good	1
payer;	1
he	1
who	1
has	1
succeeded	1
in	1
vanquishing	1
you	1
once	1
when	1
transformed,	1
Sir	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
may	1
fairly	1
hope	1
to	1
subdue	1
you	1
in	1
your	1
own	1
proper	1
shape;	1
but	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
becoming	1
for	1
knights	1
to	1
perform	1
their	1
feats	1
of	1
arms	1
in	1
the	1
dark,	1
like	1
highwaymen	1
and	1
bullies,	1
let	1
us	1
wait	1
till	1
daylight,	1
that	1
the	1
sun	1
may	1
behold	1
our	1
deeds;	1
and	1
the	1
conditions	1
of	1
our	1
combat	1
shall	1
be	1
that	1
the	1
vanquished	1
shall	1
be	1
at	1
the	1
victor’s	1
disposal,	1
to	1
do	1
all	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
enjoin,	1
provided	1
the	1
injunction	1
be	1
such	1
as	1
shall	1
be	1
becoming	1
a	1
knight.”	1
“I	1
am	1
more	1
than	1
satisfied	1
with	1
these	1
conditions	1
and	1
terms,”	1
replied	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
and	1
so	1
saying,	1
they	1
betook	1
themselves	1
to	1
where	1
their	1
squires	1
lay,	1
and	1
found	1
them	1
snoring,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
posture	1
they	1
were	1
in	1
when	1
sleep	1
fell	1
upon	1
them.	1
They	1
roused	1
them	1
up,	1
and	1
bade	1
them	1
get	1
the	1
horses	1
ready,	1
as	1
at	1
sunrise	1
they	1
were	1
to	1
engage	1
in	1
a	1
bloody	1
and	1
arduous	1
single	1
combat;	1
at	1
which	1
intelligence	1
Sancho	1
was	1
aghast	1
and	1
thunderstruck,	1
trembling	1
for	1
the	1
safety	1
of	1
his	1
master	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
mighty	1
deeds	1
he	1
had	1
heard	1
the	1
squire	1
of	1
the	1
Grove	1
ascribe	1
to	1
his;	1
but	1
without	1
a	1
word	1
the	1
two	1
squires	1
went	1
in	1
quest	1
of	1
their	1
cattle;	1
for	1
by	1
this	1
time	1
the	1
three	1
horses	1
and	1
the	1
ass	1
had	1
smelt	1
one	1
another	1
out,	1
and	1
were	1
all	1
together.	1
On	1
the	1
way,	1
he	1
of	1
the	1
Grove	1
said	1
to	1
Sancho,	1
“You	1
must	1
know,	1
brother,	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
custom	1
with	1
the	1
fighting	1
men	1
of	1
Andalusia,	1
when	1
they	1
are	1
godfathers	1
in	1
any	1
quarrel,	1
not	1
to	1
stand	1
idle	1
with	1
folded	1
arms	1
while	1
their	1
godsons	1
fight;	1
I	1
say	1
so	1
to	1
remind	1
you	1
that	1
while	1
our	1
masters	1
are	1
fighting,	1
we,	1
too,	1
have	1
to	1
fight,	1
and	1
knock	1
one	1
another	1
to	1
shivers.”	1
“That	1
custom,	1
sir	1
squire,”	1
replied	1
Sancho,	1
“may	1
hold	1
good	1
among	1
those	1
bullies	1
and	1
fighting	1
men	1
you	1
talk	1
of,	1
but	1
certainly	1
not	1
among	1
the	1
squires	1
of	1
knights-errant;	1
at	1
least,	1
I	1
have	1
never	1
heard	1
my	1
master	1
speak	1
of	1
any	1
custom	1
of	1
the	1
sort,	1
and	1
he	1
knows	1
all	1
the	1
laws	1
of	1
knight-errantry	1
by	1
heart;	1
but	1
granting	1
it	1
true	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
an	1
express	1
law	1
that	1
squires	1
are	1
to	1
fight	1
while	1
their	1
masters	1
are	1
fighting,	1
I	1
don’t	1
mean	1
to	1
obey	1
it,	1
but	1
to	1
pay	1
the	1
penalty	1
that	1
may	1
be	1
laid	1
on	1
peacefully	1
minded	1
squires	1
like	1
myself;	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
it	1
cannot	1
be	1
more	1
than	1
two	1
pounds	1
of	1
wax,	1
and	1
I	1
would	1
rather	1
pay	1
that,	1
for	1
I	1
know	1
it	1
will	1
cost	1
me	1
less	1
than	1
the	1
lint	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
at	1
the	1
expense	1
of	1
to	1
mend	1
my	1
head,	1
which	1
I	1
look	1
upon	1
as	1
broken	1
and	1
split	1
already;	1
there’s	1
another	1
thing	1
that	1
makes	1
it	1
impossible	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
fight,	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
sword,	1
for	1
I	1
never	1
carried	1
one	1
in	1
my	1
life.”	1
“I	1
know	1
a	1
good	1
remedy	1
for	1
that,”	1
said	1
he	1
of	1
the	1
Grove;	1
“I	1
have	1
here	1
two	1
linen	1
bags	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
size;	1
you	1
shall	1
take	1
one,	1
and	1
I	1
the	1
other,	1
and	1
we	1
will	1
fight	1
at	1
bag	1
blows	1
with	1
equal	1
arms.”	1
“If	1
that’s	1
the	1
way,	1
so	1
be	1
it	1
with	1
all	1
my	1
heart,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“for	1
that	1
sort	1
of	1
battle	1
will	1
serve	1
to	1
knock	1
the	1
dust	1
out	1
of	1
us	1
instead	1
of	1
hurting	1
us.”	1
“That	1
will	1
not	1
do,”	1
said	1
the	1
other,	1
“for	1
we	1
must	1
put	1
into	1
the	1
bags,	1
to	1
keep	1
the	1
wind	1
from	1
blowing	1
them	1
away,	1
half	1
a	1
dozen	1
nice	1
smooth	1
pebbles,	1
all	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
weight;	1
and	1
in	1
this	1
way	1
we	1
shall	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
baste	1
one	1
another	1
without	1
doing	1
ourselves	1
any	1
harm	1
or	1
mischief.”	1
“Body	1
of	1
my	1
father!”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“see	1
what	1
marten	1
and	1
sable,	1
and	1
pads	1
of	1
carded	1
cotton	1
he	1
is	1
putting	1
into	1
the	1
bags,	1
that	1
our	1
heads	1
may	1
not	1
be	1
broken	1
and	1
our	1
bones	1
beaten	1
to	1
jelly!	1
But	1
even	1
if	1
they	1
are	1
filled	1
with	1
toss	1
silk,	1
I	1
can	1
tell	1
you,	1
señor,	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
going	1
to	1
fight;	1
let	1
our	1
masters	1
fight,	1
that’s	1
their	1
lookout,	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
drink	1
and	1
live;	1
for	1
time	1
will	1
take	1
care	1
to	1
ease	1
us	1
of	1
our	1
lives,	1
without	1
our	1
going	1
to	1
look	1
for	1
fillips	1
so	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
be	1
finished	1
off	1
before	1
their	1
proper	1
time	1
comes	1
and	1
they	1
drop	1
from	1
ripeness.”	1
“Still,”	1
returned	1
he	1
of	1
the	1
Grove,	1
“we	1
must	1
fight,	1
if	1
it	1
be	1
only	1
for	1
half	1
an	1
hour.”	1
“By	1
no	1
means,”	1
said	1
Sancho;	1
“I	1
am	1
not	1
going	1
to	1
be	1
so	1
discourteous	1
or	1
so	1
ungrateful	1
as	1
to	1
have	1
any	1
quarrel,	1
be	1
it	1
ever	1
so	1
small,	1
with	1
one	1
I	1
have	1
eaten	1
and	1
drunk	1
with;	1
besides,	1
who	1
the	1
devil	1
could	1
bring	1
himself	1
to	1
fight	1
in	1
cold	1
blood,	1
without	1
anger	1
or	1
provocation?”	1
“I	1
can	1
remedy	1
that	1
entirely,”	1
said	1
he	1
of	1
the	1
Grove,	1
“and	1
in	1
this	1
way:	1
before	1
we	1
begin	1
the	1
battle,	1
I	1
will	1
come	1
up	1
to	1
your	1
worship	1
fair	1
and	1
softly,	1
and	1
give	1
you	1
three	1
or	1
four	1
buffets,	1
with	1
which	1
I	1
shall	1
stretch	1
you	1
at	1
my	1
feet	1
and	1
rouse	1
your	1
anger,	1
though	1
it	1
were	1
sleeping	1
sounder	1
than	1
a	1
dormouse.”	1
“To	1
match	1
that	1
plan,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“I	1
have	1
another	1
that	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
whit	1
behind	1
it;	1
I	1
will	1
take	1
a	1
cudgel,	1
and	1
before	1
your	1
worship	1
comes	1
near	1
enough	1
to	1
waken	1
my	1
anger	1
I	1
will	1
send	1
yours	1
so	1
sound	1
to	1
sleep	1
with	1
whacks,	1
that	1
it	1
won’t	1
waken	1
unless	1
it	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
other	1
world,	1
where	1
it	1
is	1
known	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
a	1
man	1
to	1
let	1
my	1
face	1
be	1
handled	1
by	1
anyone;	1
let	1
each	1
look	1
out	1
for	1
the	1
arrow—though	1
the	1
surer	1
way	1
would	1
be	1
to	1
let	1
everyone’s	1
anger	1
sleep,	1
for	1
nobody	1
knows	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
anyone,	1
and	1
a	1
man	1
may	1
come	1
for	1
wool	1
and	1
go	1
back	1
shorn;	1
God	1
gave	1
his	1
blessing	1
to	1
peace	1
and	1
his	1
curse	1
to	1
quarrels;	1
if	1
a	1
hunted	1
cat,	1
surrounded	1
and	1
hard	1
pressed,	1
turns	1
into	1
a	1
lion,	1
God	1
knows	1
what	1
I,	1
who	1
am	1
a	1
man,	1
may	1
turn	1
into;	1
and	1
so	1
from	1
this	1
time	1
forth	1
I	1
warn	1
you,	1
sir	1
squire,	1
that	1
all	1
the	1
harm	1
and	1
mischief	1
that	1
may	1
come	1
of	1
our	1
quarrel	1
will	1
be	1
put	1
down	1
to	1
your	1
account.”	1
“Very	1
good,”	1
said	1
he	1
of	1
the	1
Grove;	1
“God	1
will	1
send	1
the	1
dawn	1
and	1
we	1
shall	1
be	1
all	1
right.”	1
And	1
now	1
gay-plumaged	1
birds	1
of	1
all	1
sorts	1
began	1
to	1
warble	1
in	1
the	1
trees,	1
and	1
with	1
their	1
varied	1
and	1
gladsome	1
notes	1
seemed	1
to	1
welcome	1
and	1
salute	1
the	1
fresh	1
morn	1
that	1
was	1
beginning	1
to	1
show	1
the	1
beauty	1
of	1
her	1
countenance	1
at	1
the	1
gates	1
and	1
balconies	1
of	1
the	1
east,	1
shaking	1
from	1
her	1
locks	1
a	1
profusion	1
of	1
liquid	1
pearls;	1
in	1
which	1
dulcet	1
moisture	1
bathed,	1
the	1
plants,	1
too,	1
seemed	1
to	1
shed	1
and	1
shower	1
down	1
a	1
pearly	1
spray,	1
the	1
willows	1
distilled	1
sweet	1
manna,	1
the	1
fountains	1
laughed,	1
the	1
brooks	1
babbled,	1
the	1
woods	1
rejoiced,	1
and	1
the	1
meadows	1
arrayed	1
themselves	1
in	1
all	1
their	1
glory	1
at	1
her	1
coming.	1
But	1
hardly	1
had	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
day	1
made	1
it	1
possible	1
to	1
see	1
and	1
distinguish	1
things,	1
when	1
the	1
first	1
object	1
that	1
presented	1
itself	1
to	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
Sancho	1
Panza	1
was	1
the	1
squire	1
of	1
the	1
Grove’s	1
nose,	1
which	1
was	1
so	1
big	1
that	1
it	1
almost	1
overshadowed	1
his	1
whole	1
body.	1
It	1
is,	1
in	1
fact,	1
stated,	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
of	1
enormous	1
size,	1
hooked	1
in	1
the	1
middle,	1
covered	1
with	1
warts,	1
and	1
of	1
a	1
mulberry	1
colour	1
like	1
an	1
egg-plant;	1
it	1
hung	1
down	1
two	1
fingers’	1
length	1
below	1
his	1
mouth,	1
and	1
the	1
size,	1
the	1
colour,	1
the	1
warts,	1
and	1
the	1
bend	1
of	1
it,	1
made	1
his	1
face	1
so	1
hideous,	1
that	1
Sancho,	1
as	1
he	1
looked	1
at	1
him,	1
began	1
to	1
tremble	1
hand	1
and	1
foot	1
like	1
a	1
child	1
in	1
convulsions,	1
and	1
he	1
vowed	1
in	1
his	1
heart	1
to	1
let	1
himself	1
be	1
given	1
two	1
hundred	1
buffets,	1
sooner	1
than	1
be	1
provoked	1
to	1
fight	1
that	1
monster.	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
examined	1
his	1
adversary,	1
and	1
found	1
that	1
he	1
already	1
had	1
his	1
helmet	1
on	1
and	1
visor	1
lowered,	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
see	1
his	1
face;	1
he	1
observed,	1
however,	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
sturdily	1
built	1
man,	1
but	1
not	1
very	1
tall	1
in	1
stature.	1
Over	1
his	1
armour	1
he	1
wore	1
a	1
surcoat	1
or	1
cassock	1
of	1
what	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
finest	1
cloth	1
of	1
gold,	1
all	1
bespangled	1
with	1
glittering	1
mirrors	1
like	1
little	1
moons,	1
which	1
gave	1
him	1
an	1
extremely	1
gallant	1
and	1
splendid	1
appearance;	1
above	1
his	1
helmet	1
fluttered	1
a	1
great	1
quantity	1
of	1
plumes,	1
green,	1
yellow,	1
and	1
white,	1
and	1
his	1
lance,	1
which	1
was	1
leaning	1
against	1
a	1
tree,	1
was	1
very	1
long	1
and	1
stout,	1
and	1
had	1
a	1
steel	1
point	1
more	1
than	1
a	1
palm	1
in	1
length.	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
observed	1
all,	1
and	1
took	1
note	1
of	1
all,	1
and	1
from	1
what	1
he	1
saw	1
and	1
observed	1
he	1
concluded	1
that	1
the	1
said	1
knight	1
must	1
be	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
great	1
strength,	1
but	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
for	1
all	1
that	1
give	1
way	1
to	1
fear,	1
like	1
Sancho	1
Panza;	1
on	1
the	1
contrary,	1
with	1
a	1
composed	1
and	1
dauntless	1
air,	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
Knight	1
of	1
the	1
Mirrors,	1
“If,	1
sir	1
knight,	1
your	1
great	1
eagerness	1
to	1
fight	1
has	1
not	1
banished	1
your	1
courtesy,	1
by	1
it	1
I	1
would	1
entreat	1
you	1
to	1
raise	1
your	1
visor	1
a	1
little,	1
in	1
order	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
see	1
if	1
the	1
comeliness	1
of	1
your	1
countenance	1
corresponds	1
with	1
that	1
of	1
your	1
equipment.”	1
“Whether	1
you	1
come	1
victorious	1
or	1
vanquished	1
out	1
of	1
this	1
emprise,	1
sir	1
knight,”	1
replied	1
he	1
of	1
the	1
Mirrors,	1
“you	1
will	1
have	1
more	1
than	1
enough	1
time	1
and	1
leisure	1
to	1
see	1
me;	1
and	1
if	1
now	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
comply	1
with	1
your	1
request,	1
it	1
is	1
because	1
it	1
seems	1
to	1
me	1
I	1
should	1
do	1
a	1
serious	1
wrong	1
to	1
the	1
fair	1
Casildea	1
de	1
Vandalia	1
in	1
wasting	1
time	1
while	1
I	1
stopped	1
to	1
raise	1
my	1
visor	1
before	1
compelling	1
you	1
to	1
confess	1
what	1
you	1
are	1
already	1
aware	1
I	1
maintain.”	1
“Well	1
then,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“while	1
we	1
are	1
mounting	1
you	1
can	1
at	1
least	1
tell	1
me	1
if	1
I	1
am	1
that	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
whom	1
you	1
said	1
you	1
vanquished.”	1
“To	1
that	1
we	1
answer	1
you,”	1
said	1
he	1
of	1
the	1
Mirrors,	1
“that	1
you	1
are	1
as	1
like	1
the	1
very	1
knight	1
I	1
vanquished	1
as	1
one	1
egg	1
is	1
like	1
another,	1
but	1
as	1
you	1
say	1
enchanters	1
persecute	1
you,	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
venture	1
to	1
say	1
positively	1
whether	1
you	1
are	1
the	1
said	1
person	1
or	1
not.”	1
“That,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“is	1
enough	1
to	1
convince	1
me	1
that	1
you	1
are	1
under	1
a	1
deception;	1
however,	1
entirely	1
to	1
relieve	1
you	1
of	1
it,	1
let	1
our	1
horses	1
be	1
brought,	1
and	1
in	1
less	1
time	1
than	1
it	1
would	1
take	1
you	1
to	1
raise	1
your	1
visor,	1
if	1
God,	1
my	1
lady,	1
and	1
my	1
arm	1
stand	1
me	1
in	1
good	1
stead,	1
I	1
shall	1
see	1
your	1
face,	1
and	1
you	1
shall	1
see	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
the	1
vanquished	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
you	1
take	1
me	1
to	1
be.”	1
With	1
this,	1
cutting	1
short	1
the	1
colloquy,	1
they	1
mounted,	1
and	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
wheeled	1
Rocinante	1
round	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
take	1
a	1
proper	1
distance	1
to	1
charge	1
back	1
upon	1
his	1
adversary,	1
and	1
he	1
of	1
the	1
Mirrors	1
did	1
the	1
same;	1
but	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
had	1
not	1
moved	1
away	1
twenty	1
paces	1
when	1
he	1
heard	1
himself	1
called	1
by	1
the	1
other,	1
and,	1
each	1
returning	1
half-way,	1
he	1
of	1
the	1
Mirrors	1
said	1
to	1
him,	1
“Remember,	1
sir	1
knight,	1
that	1
the	1
terms	1
of	1
our	1
combat	1
are,	1
that	1
the	1
vanquished,	1
as	1
I	1
said	1
before,	1
shall	1
be	1
at	1
the	1
victor’s	1
disposal.”	1
“I	1
am	1
aware	1
of	1
it	1
already,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
“provided	1
what	1
is	1
commanded	1
and	1
imposed	1
upon	1
the	1
vanquished	1
be	1
things	1
that	1
do	1
not	1
transgress	1
the	1
limits	1
of	1
chivalry.”	1
“That	1
is	1
understood,”	1
replied	1
he	1
of	1
the	1
Mirrors.	1
At	1
this	1
moment	1
the	1
extraordinary	1
nose	1
of	1
the	1
squire	1
presented	1
itself	1
to	1
Don	1
Quixote’s	1
view,	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
no	1
less	1
amazed	1
than	1
Sancho	1
at	1
the	1
sight;	1
insomuch	1
that	1
he	1
set	1
him	1
down	1
as	1
a	1
monster	1
of	1
some	1
kind,	1
or	1
a	1
human	1
being	1
of	1
some	1
new	1
species	1
or	1
unearthly	1
breed.	1
Sancho,	1
seeing	1
his	1
master	1
retiring	1
to	1
run	1
his	1
course,	1
did	1
not	1
like	1
to	1
be	1
left	1
alone	1
with	1
the	1
nosy	1
man,	1
fearing	1
that	1
with	1
one	1
flap	1
of	1
that	1
nose	1
on	1
his	1
own	1
the	1
battle	1
would	1
be	1
all	1
over	1
for	1
him	1
and	1
he	1
would	1
be	1
left	1
stretched	1
on	1
the	1
ground,	1
either	1
by	1
the	1
blow	1
or	1
with	1
fright;	1
so	1
he	1
ran	1
after	1
his	1
master,	1
holding	1
on	1
to	1
Rocinante’s	1
stirrup-leather,	1
and	1
when	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
time	1
to	1
turn	1
about,	1
he	1
said,	1
“I	1
implore	1
of	1
your	1
worship,	1
señor,	1
before	1
you	1
turn	1
to	1
charge,	1
to	1
help	1
me	1
up	1
into	1
this	1
cork	1
tree,	1
from	1
which	1
I	1
will	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
witness	1
the	1
gallant	1
encounter	1
your	1
worship	1
is	1
going	1
to	1
have	1
with	1
this	1
knight,	1
more	1
to	1
my	1
taste	1
and	1
better	1
than	1
from	1
the	1
ground.”	1
“It	1
seems	1
to	1
me	1
rather,	1
Sancho,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“that	1
thou	1
wouldst	1
mount	1
a	1
scaffold	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
bulls	1
without	1
danger.”	1
“To	1
tell	1
the	1
truth,”	1
returned	1
Sancho,	1
“the	1
monstrous	1
nose	1
of	1
that	1
squire	1
has	1
filled	1
me	1
with	1
fear	1
and	1
terror,	1
and	1
I	1
dare	1
not	1
stay	1
near	1
him.”	1
“It	1
is,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“such	1
a	1
one	1
that	1
were	1
I	1
not	1
what	1
I	1
am	1
it	1
would	1
terrify	1
me	1
too;	1
so,	1
come,	1
I	1
will	1
help	1
thee	1
up	1
where	1
thou	1
wilt.”	1
While	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
waited	1
for	1
Sancho	1
to	1
mount	1
into	1
the	1
cork	1
tree	1
he	1
of	1
the	1
Mirrors	1
took	1
as	1
much	1
ground	1
as	1
he	1
considered	1
requisite,	1
and,	1
supposing	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
to	1
have	1
done	1
the	1
same,	1
without	1
waiting	1
for	1
any	1
sound	1
of	1
trumpet	1
or	1
other	1
signal	1
to	1
direct	1
them,	1
he	1
wheeled	1
his	1
horse,	1
which	1
was	1
not	1
more	1
agile	1
or	1
better-looking	1
than	1
Rocinante,	1
and	1
at	1
his	1
top	1
speed,	1
which	1
was	1
an	1
easy	1
trot,	1
he	1
proceeded	1
to	1
charge	1
his	1
enemy;	1
seeing	1
him,	1
however,	1
engaged	1
in	1
putting	1
Sancho	1
up,	1
he	1
drew	1
rein,	1
and	1
halted	1
in	1
mid	1
career,	1
for	1
which	1
his	1
horse	1
was	1
very	1
grateful,	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
already	1
unable	1
to	1
go.	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
fancying	1
that	1
his	1
foe	1
was	1
coming	1
down	1
upon	1
him	1
flying,	1
drove	1
his	1
spurs	1
vigorously	1
into	1
Rocinante’s	1
lean	1
flanks	1
and	1
made	1
him	1
scud	1
along	1
in	1
such	1
style	1
that	1
the	1
history	1
tells	1
us	1
that	1
on	1
this	1
occasion	1
only	1
was	1
he	1
known	1
to	1
make	1
something	1
like	1
running,	1
for	1
on	1
all	1
others	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
simple	1
trot	1
with	1
him;	1
and	1
with	1
this	1
unparalleled	1
fury	1
he	1
bore	1
down	1
where	1
he	1
of	1
the	1
Mirrors	1
stood	1
digging	1
his	1
spurs	1
into	1
his	1
horse	1
up	1
to	1
buttons,	1
without	1
being	1
able	1
to	1
make	1
him	1
stir	1
a	1
finger’s	1
length	1
from	1
the	1
spot	1
where	1
he	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
a	1
standstill	1
in	1
his	1
course.	1
At	1
this	1
lucky	1
moment	1
and	1
crisis,	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
came	1
upon	1
his	1
adversary,	1
in	1
trouble	1
with	1
his	1
horse,	1
and	1
embarrassed	1
with	1
his	1
lance,	1
which	1
he	1
either	1
could	1
not	1
manage,	1
or	1
had	1
no	1
time	1
to	1
lay	1
in	1
rest.	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
however,	1
paid	1
no	1
attention	1
to	1
these	1
difficulties,	1
and	1
in	1
perfect	1
safety	1
to	1
himself	1
and	1
without	1
any	1
risk	1
encountered	1
him	1
of	1
the	1
Mirrors	1
with	1
such	1
force	1
that	1
he	1
brought	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
ground	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
himself	1
over	1
the	1
haunches	1
of	1
his	1
horse,	1
and	1
with	1
so	1
heavy	1
a	1
fall	1
that	1
he	1
lay	1
to	1
all	1
appearance	1
dead,	1
not	1
stirring	1
hand	1
or	1
foot.	1
The	1
instant	1
Sancho	1
saw	1
him	1
fall	1
he	1
slid	1
down	1
from	1
the	1
cork	1
tree,	1
and	1
made	1
all	1
haste	1
to	1
where	1
his	1
master	1
was,	1
who,	1
dismounting	1
from	1
Rocinante,	1
went	1
and	1
stood	1
over	1
him	1
of	1
the	1
Mirrors,	1
and	1
unlacing	1
his	1
helmet	1
to	1
see	1
if	1
he	1
was	1
dead,	1
and	1
to	1
give	1
him	1
air	1
if	1
he	1
should	1
happen	1
to	1
be	1
alive,	1
he	1
saw—who	1
can	1
say	1
what	1
he	1
saw,	1
without	1
filling	1
all	1
who	1
hear	1
it	1
with	1
astonishment,	1
wonder,	1
and	1
awe?	1
He	1
saw,	1
the	1
history	1
says,	1
the	1
very	1
countenance,	1
the	1
very	1
face,	1
the	1
very	1
look,	1
the	1
very	1
physiognomy,	1
the	1
very	1
effigy,	1
the	1
very	1
image	1
of	1
the	1
bachelor	1
Samson	1
Carrasco!	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
saw	1
it	1
he	1
called	1
out	1
in	1
a	1
loud	1
voice,	1
“Make	1
haste	1
here,	1
Sancho,	1
and	1
behold	1
what	1
thou	1
art	1
to	1
see	1
but	1
not	1
to	1
believe;	1
quick,	1
my	1
son,	1
and	1
learn	1
what	1
magic	1
can	1
do,	1
and	1
wizards	1
and	1
enchanters	1
are	1
capable	1
of.”	1
Sancho	1
came	1
up,	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
the	1
countenance	1
of	1
the	1
bachelor	1
Carrasco,	1
he	1
fell	1
to	1
crossing	1
himself	1
a	1
thousand	1
times,	1
and	1
blessing	1
himself	1
as	1
many	1
more.	1
All	1
this	1
time	1
the	1
prostrate	1
knight	1
showed	1
no	1
signs	1
of	1
life,	1
and	1
Sancho	1
said	1
to	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“It	1
is	1
my	1
opinion,	1
señor,	1
that	1
in	1
any	1
case	1
your	1
worship	1
should	1
take	1
and	1
thrust	1
your	1
sword	1
into	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
this	1
one	1
here	1
that	1
looks	1
like	1
the	1
bachelor	1
Samson	1
Carrasco;	1
perhaps	1
in	1
him	1
you	1
will	1
kill	1
one	1
of	1
your	1
enemies,	1
the	1
enchanters.”	1
“Thy	1
advice	1
is	1
not	1
bad,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“for	1
of	1
enemies	1
the	1
fewer	1
the	1
better;”	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
drawing	1
his	1
sword	1
to	1
carry	1
into	1
effect	1
Sancho’s	1
counsel	1
and	1
suggestion,	1
when	1
the	1
squire	1
of	1
the	1
Mirrors	1
came	1
up,	1
now	1
without	1
the	1
nose	1
which	1
had	1
made	1
him	1
so	1
hideous,	1
and	1
cried	1
out	1
in	1
a	1
loud	1
voice,	1
“Mind	1
what	1
you	1
are	1
about,	1
Señor	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
that	1
is	1
your	1
friend,	1
the	1
bachelor	1
Samson	1
Carrasco,	1
you	1
have	1
at	1
your	1
feet,	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
his	1
squire.”	1
“And	1
the	1
nose?”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
seeing	1
him	1
without	1
the	1
hideous	1
feature	1
he	1
had	1
before;	1
to	1
which	1
he	1
replied,	1
“I	1
have	1
it	1
here	1
in	1
my	1
pocket,”	1
and	1
putting	1
his	1
hand	1
into	1
his	1
right	1
pocket,	1
he	1
pulled	1
out	1
a	1
masquerade	1
nose	1
of	1
varnished	1
pasteboard	1
of	1
the	1
make	1
already	1
described;	1
and	1
Sancho,	1
examining	1
him	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
closely,	1
exclaimed	1
aloud	1
in	1
a	1
voice	1
of	1
amazement,	1
“Holy	1
Mary	1
be	1
good	1
to	1
me!	1
Isn’t	1
it	1
Tom	1
Cecial,	1
my	1
neighbour	1
and	1
gossip?”	1
“Why,	1
to	1
be	1
sure	1
I	1
am!”	1
returned	1
the	1
now	1
unnosed	1
squire;	1
“Tom	1
Cecial	1
I	1
am,	1
gossip	1
and	1
friend	1
Sancho	1
Panza;	1
and	1
I’ll	1
tell	1
you	1
presently	1
the	1
means	1
and	1
tricks	1
and	1
falsehoods	1
by	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
brought	1
here;	1
but	1
in	1
the	1
meantime,	1
beg	1
and	1
entreat	1
of	1
your	1
master	1
not	1
to	1
touch,	1
maltreat,	1
wound,	1
or	1
slay	1
the	1
Knight	1
of	1
the	1
Mirrors	1
whom	1
he	1
has	1
at	1
his	1
feet;	1
because,	1
beyond	1
all	1
dispute,	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
rash	1
and	1
ill-advised	1
bachelor	1
Samson	1
Carrasco,	1
our	1
fellow	1
townsman.”	1
At	1
this	1
moment	1
he	1
of	1
the	1
Mirrors	1
came	1
to	1
himself,	1
and	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
perceiving	1
it,	1
held	1
the	1
naked	1
point	1
of	1
his	1
sword	1
over	1
his	1
face,	1
and	1
said	1
to	1
him,	1
“You	1
are	1
a	1
dead	1
man,	1
knight,	1
unless	1
you	1
confess	1
that	1
the	1
peerless	1
Dulcinea	1
del	1
Toboso	1
excels	1
your	1
Casildea	1
de	1
Vandalia	1
in	1
beauty;	1
and	1
in	1
addition	1
to	1
this	1
you	1
must	1
promise,	1
if	1
you	1
should	1
survive	1
this	1
encounter	1
and	1
fall,	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
El	1
Toboso	1
and	1
present	1
yourself	1
before	1
her	1
on	1
my	1
behalf,	1
that	1
she	1
deal	1
with	1
you	1
according	1
to	1
her	1
good	1
pleasure;	1
and	1
if	1
she	1
leaves	1
you	1
free	1
to	1
do	1
yours,	1
you	1
are	1
in	1
like	1
manner	1
to	1
return	1
and	1
seek	1
me	1
out	1
(for	1
the	1
trail	1
of	1
my	1
mighty	1
deeds	1
will	1
serve	1
you	1
as	1
a	1
guide	1
to	1
lead	1
you	1
to	1
where	1
I	1
may	1
be),	1
and	1
tell	1
me	1
what	1
may	1
have	1
passed	1
between	1
you	1
and	1
her—conditions	1
which,	1
in	1
accordance	1
with	1
what	1
we	1
stipulated	1
before	1
our	1
combat,	1
do	1
not	1
transgress	1
the	1
just	1
limits	1
of	1
knight-errantry.”	1
“I	1
confess,”	1
said	1
the	1
fallen	1
knight,	1
“that	1
the	1
dirty	1
tattered	1
shoe	1
of	1
the	1
lady	1
Dulcinea	1
del	1
Toboso	1
is	1
better	1
than	1
the	1
ill-combed	1
though	1
clean	1
beard	1
of	1
Casildea;	1
and	1
I	1
promise	1
to	1
go	1
and	1
to	1
return	1
from	1
her	1
presence	1
to	1
yours,	1
and	1
to	1
give	1
you	1
a	1
full	1
and	1
particular	1
account	1
of	1
all	1
you	1
demand	1
of	1
me.”	1
“You	1
must	1
also	1
confess	1
and	1
believe,”	1
added	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“that	1
the	1
knight	1
you	1
vanquished	1
was	1
not	1
and	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
of	1
La	1
Mancha,	1
but	1
someone	1
else	1
in	1
his	1
likeness,	1
just	1
as	1
I	1
confess	1
and	1
believe	1
that	1
you,	1
though	1
you	1
seem	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
bachelor	1
Samson	1
Carrasco,	1
are	1
not	1
so,	1
but	1
some	1
other	1
resembling	1
him,	1
whom	1
my	1
enemies	1
have	1
here	1
put	1
before	1
me	1
in	1
his	1
shape,	1
in	1
order	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
restrain	1
and	1
moderate	1
the	1
vehemence	1
of	1
my	1
wrath,	1
and	1
make	1
a	1
gentle	1
use	1
of	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
my	1
victory.”	1
“I	1
confess,	1
hold,	1
and	1
think	1
everything	1
to	1
be	1
as	1
you	1
believe,	1
hold,	1
and	1
think	1
it,”	1
the	1
crippled	1
knight;	1
“let	1
me	1
rise,	1
I	1
entreat	1
you;	1
if,	1
indeed,	1
the	1
shock	1
of	1
my	1
fall	1
will	1
allow	1
me,	1
for	1
it	1
has	1
left	1
me	1
in	1
a	1
sorry	1
plight	1
enough.”	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
helped	1
him	1
to	1
rise,	1
with	1
the	1
assistance	1
of	1
his	1
squire	1
Tom	1
Cecial;	1
from	1
whom	1
Sancho	1
never	1
took	1
his	1
eyes,	1
and	1
to	1
whom	1
he	1
put	1
questions,	1
the	1
replies	1
to	1
which	1
furnished	1
clear	1
proof	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
really	1
and	1
truly	1
the	1
Tom	1
Cecial	1
he	1
said;	1
but	1
the	1
impression	1
made	1
on	1
Sancho’s	1
mind	1
by	1
what	1
his	1
master	1
said	1
about	1
the	1
enchanters	1
having	1
changed	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
Knight	1
of	1
the	1
Mirrors	1
into	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
bachelor	1
Samson	1
Carrasco,	1
would	1
not	1
permit	1
him	1
to	1
believe	1
what	1
he	1
saw	1
with	1
his	1
eyes.	1
In	1
fine,	1
both	1
master	1
and	1
man	1
remained	1
under	1
the	1
delusion;	1
and,	1
down	1
in	1
the	1
mouth,	1
and	1
out	1
of	1
luck,	1
he	1
of	1
the	1
Mirrors	1
and	1
his	1
squire	1
parted	1
from	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
and	1
Sancho,	1
he	1
meaning	1
to	1
go	1
look	1
for	1
some	1
village	1
where	1
he	1
could	1
plaster	1
and	1
strap	1
his	1
ribs.	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
and	1
Sancho	1
resumed	1
their	1
journey	1
to	1
Saragossa,	1
and	1
on	1
it	1
the	1
history	1
leaves	1
them	1
in	1
order	1
that	1
it	1
may	1
tell	1
who	1
the	1
Knight	1
of	1
the	1
Mirrors	1
and	1
his	1
long-nosed	1
squire	1
were.	1

Don	1
Quixote	1
went	1
off	1
satisfied,	1
elated,	1
and	1
vain-glorious	1
in	1
the	1
highest	1
degree	1
at	1
having	1
won	1
a	1
victory	1
over	1
such	1
a	1
valiant	1
knight	1
as	1
he	1
fancied	1
him	1
of	1
the	1
Mirrors	1
to	1
be,	1
and	1
one	1
from	1
whose	1
knightly	1
word	1
he	1
expected	1
to	1
learn	1
whether	1
the	1
enchantment	1
of	1
his	1
lady	1
still	1
continued;	1
inasmuch	1
as	1
the	1
said	1
vanquished	1
knight	1
was	1
bound,	1
under	1
the	1
penalty	1
of	1
ceasing	1
to	1
be	1
one,	1
to	1
return	1
and	1
render	1
him	1
an	1
account	1
of	1
what	1
took	1
place	1
between	1
him	1
and	1
her.	1
But	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
was	1
of	1
one	1
mind,	1
he	1
of	1
the	1
Mirrors	1
of	1
another,	1
for	1
he	1
just	1
then	1
had	1
no	1
thought	1
of	1
anything	1
but	1
finding	1
some	1
village	1
where	1
he	1
could	1
plaster	1
himself,	1
as	1
has	1
been	1
said	1
already.	1
The	1
history	1
goes	1
on	1
to	1
say,	1
then,	1
that	1
when	1
the	1
bachelor	1
Samson	1
Carrasco	1
recommended	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
to	1
resume	1
his	1
knight-errantry	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
laid	1
aside,	1
it	1
was	1
in	1
consequence	1
of	1
having	1
been	1
previously	1
in	1
conclave	1
with	1
the	1
curate	1
and	1
the	1
barber	1
on	1
the	1
means	1
to	1
be	1
adopted	1
to	1
induce	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
to	1
stay	1
at	1
home	1
in	1
peace	1
and	1
quiet	1
without	1
worrying	1
himself	1
with	1
his	1
ill-starred	1
adventures;	1
at	1
which	1
consultation	1
it	1
was	1
decided	1
by	1
the	1
unanimous	1
vote	1
of	1
all,	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
special	1
advice	1
of	1
Carrasco,	1
that	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
should	1
be	1
allowed	1
to	1
go,	1
as	1
it	1
seemed	1
impossible	1
to	1
restrain	1
him,	1
and	1
that	1
Samson	1
should	1
sally	1
forth	1
to	1
meet	1
him	1
as	1
a	1
knight-errant,	1
and	1
do	1
battle	1
with	1
him,	1
for	1
there	1
would	1
be	1
no	1
difficulty	1
about	1
a	1
cause,	1
and	1
vanquish	1
him,	1
that	1
being	1
looked	1
upon	1
as	1
an	1
easy	1
matter;	1
and	1
that	1
it	1
should	1
be	1
agreed	1
and	1
settled	1
that	1
the	1
vanquished	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
at	1
the	1
mercy	1
of	1
the	1
victor.	1
Then,	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
being	1
vanquished,	1
the	1
bachelor	1
knight	1
was	1
to	1
command	1
him	1
to	1
return	1
to	1
his	1
village	1
and	1
his	1
house,	1
and	1
not	1
quit	1
it	1
for	1
two	1
years,	1
or	1
until	1
he	1
received	1
further	1
orders	1
from	1
him;	1
all	1
which	1
it	1
was	1
clear	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
would	1
unhesitatingly	1
obey,	1
rather	1
than	1
contravene	1
or	1
fail	1
to	1
observe	1
the	1
laws	1
of	1
chivalry;	1
and	1
during	1
the	1
period	1
of	1
his	1
seclusion	1
he	1
might	1
perhaps	1
forget	1
his	1
folly,	1
or	1
there	1
might	1
be	1
an	1
opportunity	1
of	1
discovering	1
some	1
ready	1
remedy	1
for	1
his	1
madness.	1
Carrasco	1
undertook	1
the	1
task,	1
and	1
Tom	1
Cecial,	1
a	1
gossip	1
and	1
neighbour	1
of	1
Sancho	1
Panza’s,	1
a	1
lively,	1
feather-headed	1
fellow,	1
offered	1
himself	1
as	1
his	1
squire.	1
Carrasco	1
armed	1
himself	1
in	1
the	1
fashion	1
described,	1
and	1
Tom	1
Cecial,	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
not	1
be	1
known	1
by	1
his	1
gossip	1
when	1
they	1
met,	1
fitted	1
on	1
over	1
his	1
own	1
natural	1
nose	1
the	1
false	1
masquerade	1
one	1
that	1
has	1
been	1
mentioned;	1
and	1
so	1
they	1
followed	1
the	1
same	1
route	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
took,	1
and	1
almost	1
came	1
up	1
with	1
him	1
in	1
time	1
to	1
be	1
present	1
at	1
the	1
adventure	1
of	1
the	1
cart	1
of	1
Death	1
and	1
finally	1
encountered	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
grove,	1
where	1
all	1
that	1
the	1
sagacious	1
reader	1
has	1
been	1
reading	1
about	1
took	1
place;	1
and	1
had	1
it	1
not	1
been	1
for	1
the	1
extraordinary	1
fancies	1
of	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
and	1
his	1
conviction	1
that	1
the	1
bachelor	1
was	1
not	1
the	1
bachelor,	1
señor	1
bachelor	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
incapacitated	1
for	1
ever	1
from	1
taking	1
his	1
degree	1
of	1
licentiate,	1
all	1
through	1
not	1
finding	1
nests	1
where	1
he	1
thought	1
to	1
find	1
birds.	1
Tom	1
Cecial,	1
seeing	1
how	1
ill	1
they	1
had	1
succeeded,	1
and	1
what	1
a	1
sorry	1
end	1
their	1
expedition	1
had	1
come	1
to,	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
bachelor,	1
“Sure	1
enough,	1
Señor	1
Samson	1
Carrasco,	1
we	1
are	1
served	1
right;	1
it	1
is	1
easy	1
enough	1
to	1
plan	1
and	1
set	1
about	1
an	1
enterprise,	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
often	1
a	1
difficult	1
matter	1
to	1
come	1
well	1
out	1
of	1
it.	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
a	1
madman,	1
and	1
we	1
sane;	1
he	1
goes	1
off	1
laughing,	1
safe,	1
and	1
sound,	1
and	1
you	1
are	1
left	1
sore	1
and	1
sorry!	1
I’d	1
like	1
to	1
know	1
now	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
madder,	1
he	1
who	1
is	1
so	1
because	1
he	1
cannot	1
help	1
it,	1
or	1
he	1
who	1
is	1
so	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
choice?”	1
To	1
which	1
Samson	1
replied,	1
“The	1
difference	1
between	1
the	1
two	1
sorts	1
of	1
madmen	1
is,	1
that	1
he	1
who	1
is	1
so	1
will	1
he	1
nil	1
he,	1
will	1
be	1
one	1
always,	1
while	1
he	1
who	1
is	1
so	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
accord	1
can	1
leave	1
off	1
being	1
one	1
whenever	1
he	1
likes.”	1
“In	1
that	1
case,”	1
said	1
Tom	1
Cecial,	1
“I	1
was	1
a	1
madman	1
of	1
my	1
own	1
accord	1
when	1
I	1
volunteered	1
to	1
become	1
your	1
squire,	1
and,	1
of	1
my	1
own	1
accord,	1
I’ll	1
leave	1
off	1
being	1
one	1
and	1
go	1
home.”	1
“That’s	1
your	1
affair,”	1
returned	1
Samson,	1
“but	1
to	1
suppose	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
going	1
home	1
until	1
I	1
have	1
given	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
a	1
thrashing	1
is	1
absurd;	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
any	1
wish	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
recover	1
his	1
senses	1
that	1
will	1
make	1
me	1
hunt	1
him	1
out	1
now,	1
but	1
a	1
wish	1
for	1
the	1
sore	1
pain	1
I	1
am	1
in	1
with	1
my	1
ribs	1
won’t	1
let	1
me	1
entertain	1
more	1
charitable	1
thoughts.”	1
Thus	1
discoursing,	1
the	1
pair	1
proceeded	1
until	1
they	1
reached	1
a	1
town	1
where	1
it	1
was	1
their	1
good	1
luck	1
to	1
find	1
a	1
bone-setter,	1
with	1
whose	1
help	1
the	1
unfortunate	1
Samson	1
was	1
cured.	1
Tom	1
Cecial	1
left	1
him	1
and	1
went	1
home,	1
while	1
he	1
stayed	1
behind	1
meditating	1
vengeance;	1
and	1
the	1
history	1
will	1
return	1
to	1
him	1
again	1
at	1
the	1
proper	1
time,	1
so	1
as	1
not	1
to	1
omit	1
making	1
merry	1
with	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
now.	1

Don	1
Quixote	1
pursued	1
his	1
journey	1
in	1
the	1
high	1
spirits,	1
satisfaction,	1
and	1
self-complacency	1
already	1
described,	1
fancying	1
himself	1
the	1
most	1
valorous	1
knight-errant	1
of	1
the	1
age	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
because	1
of	1
his	1
late	1
victory.	1
All	1
the	1
adventures	1
that	1
could	1
befall	1
him	1
from	1
that	1
time	1
forth	1
he	1
regarded	1
as	1
already	1
done	1
and	1
brought	1
to	1
a	1
happy	1
issue;	1
he	1
made	1
light	1
of	1
enchantments	1
and	1
enchanters;	1
he	1
thought	1
no	1
more	1
of	1
the	1
countless	1
drubbings	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
administered	1
to	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
his	1
knight-errantry,	1
nor	1
of	1
the	1
volley	1
of	1
stones	1
that	1
had	1
levelled	1
half	1
his	1
teeth,	1
nor	1
of	1
the	1
ingratitude	1
of	1
the	1
galley	1
slaves,	1
nor	1
of	1
the	1
audacity	1
of	1
the	1
Yanguesans	1
and	1
the	1
shower	1
of	1
stakes	1
that	1
fell	1
upon	1
him;	1
in	1
short,	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
himself	1
that	1
could	1
he	1
discover	1
any	1
means,	1
mode,	1
or	1
way	1
of	1
disenchanting	1
his	1
lady	1
Dulcinea,	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
envy	1
the	1
highest	1
fortune	1
that	1
the	1
most	1
fortunate	1
knight-errant	1
of	1
yore	1
ever	1
reached	1
or	1
could	1
reach.	1
He	1
was	1
going	1
along	1
entirely	1
absorbed	1
in	1
these	1
fancies,	1
when	1
Sancho	1
said	1
to	1
him,	1
“Isn’t	1
it	1
odd,	1
señor,	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
still	1
before	1
my	1
eyes	1
that	1
monstrous	1
enormous	1
nose	1
of	1
my	1
gossip,	1
Tom	1
Cecial?”	1
“And	1
dost	1
thou,	1
then,	1
believe,	1
Sancho,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“that	1
the	1
Knight	1
of	1
the	1
Mirrors	1
was	1
the	1
bachelor	1
Carrasco,	1
and	1
his	1
squire	1
Tom	1
Cecial	1
thy	1
gossip?”	1
“I	1
don’t	1
know	1
what	1
to	1
say	1
to	1
that,”	1
replied	1
Sancho;	1
“all	1
I	1
know	1
is	1
that	1
the	1
tokens	1
he	1
gave	1
me	1
about	1
my	1
own	1
house,	1
wife	1
and	1
children,	1
nobody	1
else	1
but	1
himself	1
could	1
have	1
given	1
me;	1
and	1
the	1
face,	1
once	1
the	1
nose	1
was	1
off,	1
was	1
the	1
very	1
face	1
of	1
Tom	1
Cecial,	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
seen	1
it	1
many	1
a	1
time	1
in	1
my	1
town	1
and	1
next	1
door	1
to	1
my	1
own	1
house;	1
and	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
the	1
voice	1
was	1
just	1
the	1
same.”	1
“Let	1
us	1
reason	1
the	1
matter,	1
Sancho,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote.	1
“Come	1
now,	1
by	1
what	1
process	1
of	1
thinking	1
can	1
it	1
be	1
supposed	1
that	1
the	1
bachelor	1
Samson	1
Carrasco	1
would	1
come	1
as	1
a	1
knight-errant,	1
in	1
arms	1
offensive	1
and	1
defensive,	1
to	1
fight	1
with	1
me?	1
Have	1
I	1
ever	1
been	1
by	1
any	1
chance	1
his	1
enemy?	1
Have	1
I	1
ever	1
given	1
him	1
any	1
occasion	1
to	1
owe	1
me	1
a	1
grudge?	1
Am	1
I	1
his	1
rival,	1
or	1
does	1
he	1
profess	1
arms,	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
envy	1
the	1
fame	1
I	1
have	1
acquired	1
in	1
them?”	1
“Well,	1
but	1
what	1
are	1
we	1
to	1
say,	1
señor,”	1
returned	1
Sancho,	1
“about	1
that	1
knight,	1
whoever	1
he	1
is,	1
being	1
so	1
like	1
the	1
bachelor	1
Carrasco,	1
and	1
his	1
squire	1
so	1
like	1
my	1
gossip,	1
Tom	1
Cecial?	1
And	1
if	1
that	1
be	1
enchantment,	1
as	1
your	1
worship	1
says,	1
was	1
there	1
no	1
other	1
pair	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
for	1
them	1
to	1
take	1
the	1
likeness	1
of?”	1
“It	1
is	1
all,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“a	1
scheme	1
and	1
plot	1
of	1
the	1
malignant	1
magicians	1
that	1
persecute	1
me,	1
who,	1
foreseeing	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
victorious	1
in	1
the	1
conflict,	1
arranged	1
that	1
the	1
vanquished	1
knight	1
should	1
display	1
the	1
countenance	1
of	1
my	1
friend	1
the	1
bachelor,	1
in	1
order	1
that	1
the	1
friendship	1
I	1
bear	1
him	1
should	1
interpose	1
to	1
stay	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
my	1
sword	1
and	1
might	1
of	1
my	1
arm,	1
and	1
temper	1
the	1
just	1
wrath	1
of	1
my	1
heart;	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
who	1
sought	1
to	1
take	1
my	1
life	1
by	1
fraud	1
and	1
falsehood	1
should	1
save	1
his	1
own.	1
And	1
to	1
prove	1
it,	1
thou	1
knowest	1
already,	1
Sancho,	1
by	1
experience	1
which	1
cannot	1
lie	1
or	1
deceive,	1
how	1
easy	1
it	1
is	1
for	1
enchanters	1
to	1
change	1
one	1
countenance	1
into	1
another,	1
turning	1
fair	1
into	1
foul,	1
and	1
foul	1
into	1
fair;	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
two	1
days	1
since	1
thou	1
sawest	1
with	1
thine	1
own	1
eyes	1
the	1
beauty	1
and	1
elegance	1
of	1
the	1
peerless	1
Dulcinea	1
in	1
all	1
its	1
perfection	1
and	1
natural	1
harmony,	1
while	1
I	1
saw	1
her	1
in	1
the	1
repulsive	1
and	1
mean	1
form	1
of	1
a	1
coarse	1
country	1
wench,	1
with	1
cataracts	1
in	1
her	1
eyes	1
and	1
a	1
foul	1
smell	1
in	1
her	1
mouth;	1
and	1
when	1
the	1
perverse	1
enchanter	1
ventured	1
to	1
effect	1
so	1
wicked	1
a	1
transformation,	1
it	1
is	1
no	1
wonder	1
if	1
he	1
effected	1
that	1
of	1
Samson	1
Carrasco	1
and	1
thy	1
gossip	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
snatch	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
victory	1
out	1
of	1
my	1
grasp.	1
For	1
all	1
that,	1
however,	1
I	1
console	1
myself,	1
because,	1
after	1
all,	1
in	1
whatever	1
shape	1
he	1
may	1
have	1
been,	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
victorious	1
over	1
my	1
enemy.”	1
“God	1
knows	1
what’s	1
the	1
truth	1
of	1
it	1
all,”	1
said	1
Sancho;	1
and	1
knowing	1
as	1
he	1
did	1
that	1
the	1
transformation	1
of	1
Dulcinea	1
had	1
been	1
a	1
device	1
and	1
imposition	1
of	1
his	1
own,	1
his	1
master’s	1
illusions	1
were	1
not	1
satisfactory	1
to	1
him;	1
but	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
like	1
to	1
reply	1
lest	1
he	1
should	1
say	1
something	1
that	1
might	1
disclose	1
his	1
trickery.	1
As	1
they	1
were	1
engaged	1
in	1
this	1
conversation	1
they	1
were	1
overtaken	1
by	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
was	1
following	1
the	1
same	1
road	1
behind	1
them,	1
mounted	1
on	1
a	1
very	1
handsome	1
flea-bitten	1
mare,	1
and	1
dressed	1
in	1
a	1
gaban	1
of	1
fine	1
green	1
cloth,	1
with	1
tawny	1
velvet	1
facings,	1
and	1
a	1
montera	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
velvet.	1
The	1
trappings	1
of	1
the	1
mare	1
were	1
of	1
the	1
field	1
and	1
jineta	1
fashion,	1
and	1
of	1
mulberry	1
colour	1
and	1
green.	1
He	1
carried	1
a	1
Moorish	1
cutlass	1
hanging	1
from	1
a	1
broad	1
green	1
and	1
gold	1
baldric;	1
the	1
buskins	1
were	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
make	1
as	1
the	1
baldric;	1
the	1
spurs	1
were	1
not	1
gilt,	1
but	1
lacquered	1
green,	1
and	1
so	1
brightly	1
polished	1
that,	1
matching	1
as	1
they	1
did	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
his	1
apparel,	1
they	1
looked	1
better	1
than	1
if	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
of	1
pure	1
gold.	1
When	1
the	1
traveller	1
came	1
up	1
with	1
them	1
he	1
saluted	1
them	1
courteously,	1
and	1
spurring	1
his	1
mare	1
was	1
passing	1
them	1
without	1
stopping,	1
but	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
called	1
out	1
to	1
him,	1
“Gallant	1
sir,	1
if	1
so	1
be	1
your	1
worship	1
is	1
going	1
our	1
road,	1
and	1
has	1
no	1
occasion	1
for	1
speed,	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
pleasure	1
to	1
me	1
if	1
we	1
were	1
to	1
join	1
company.”	1
“In	1
truth,”	1
replied	1
he	1
on	1
the	1
mare,	1
“I	1
would	1
not	1
pass	1
you	1
so	1
hastily	1
but	1
for	1
fear	1
that	1
horse	1
might	1
turn	1
restive	1
in	1
the	1
company	1
of	1
my	1
mare.”	1
“You	1
may	1
safely	1
hold	1
in	1
your	1
mare,	1
señor,”	1
said	1
Sancho	1
in	1
reply	1
to	1
this,	1
“for	1
our	1
horse	1
is	1
the	1
most	1
virtuous	1
and	1
well-behaved	1
horse	1
in	1
the	1
world;	1
he	1
never	1
does	1
anything	1
wrong	1
on	1
such	1
occasions,	1
and	1
the	1
only	1
time	1
he	1
misbehaved,	1
my	1
master	1
and	1
I	1
suffered	1
for	1
it	1
sevenfold;	1
I	1
say	1
again	1
your	1
worship	1
may	1
pull	1
up	1
if	1
you	1
like;	1
for	1
if	1
she	1
was	1
offered	1
to	1
him	1
between	1
two	1
plates	1
the	1
horse	1
would	1
not	1
hanker	1
after	1
her.”	1
The	1
traveller	1
drew	1
rein,	1
amazed	1
at	1
the	1
trim	1
and	1
features	1
of	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
who	1
rode	1
without	1
his	1
helmet,	1
which	1
Sancho	1
carried	1
like	1
a	1
valise	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
Dapple’s	1
pack-saddle;	1
and	1
if	1
the	1
man	1
in	1
green	1
examined	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
closely,	1
still	1
more	1
closely	1
did	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
examine	1
the	1
man	1
in	1
green,	1
who	1
struck	1
him	1
as	1
being	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
intelligence.	1
In	1
appearance	1
he	1
was	1
about	1
fifty	1
years	1
of	1
age,	1
with	1
but	1
few	1
grey	1
hairs,	1
an	1
aquiline	1
cast	1
of	1
features,	1
and	1
an	1
expression	1
between	1
grave	1
and	1
gay;	1
and	1
his	1
dress	1
and	1
accoutrements	1
showed	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
good	1
condition.	1
What	1
he	1
in	1
green	1
thought	1
of	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
of	1
La	1
Mancha	1
was	1
that	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
that	1
sort	1
and	1
shape	1
he	1
had	1
never	1
yet	1
seen;	1
he	1
marvelled	1
at	1
the	1
length	1
of	1
his	1
hair,	1
his	1
lofty	1
stature,	1
the	1
lankness	1
and	1
sallowness	1
of	1
his	1
countenance,	1
his	1
armour,	1
his	1
bearing	1
and	1
his	1
gravity—a	1
figure	1
and	1
picture	1
such	1
as	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
seen	1
in	1
those	1
regions	1
for	1
many	1
a	1
long	1
day.	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
saw	1
very	1
plainly	1
the	1
attention	1
with	1
which	1
the	1
traveller	1
was	1
regarding	1
him,	1
and	1
read	1
his	1
curiosity	1
in	1
his	1
astonishment;	1
and	1
courteous	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
and	1
ready	1
to	1
please	1
everybody,	1
before	1
the	1
other	1
could	1
ask	1
him	1
any	1
question	1
he	1
anticipated	1
him	1
by	1
saying,	1
“The	1
appearance	1
I	1
present	1
to	1
your	1
worship	1
being	1
so	1
strange	1
and	1
so	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
common,	1
I	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
surprised	1
if	1
it	1
filled	1
you	1
with	1
wonder;	1
but	1
you	1
will	1
cease	1
to	1
wonder	1
when	1
I	1
tell	1
you,	1
as	1
I	1
do,	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
knights	1
who,	1
as	1
people	1
say,	1
go	1
seeking	1
adventures.	1
I	1
have	1
left	1
my	1
home,	1
I	1
have	1
mortgaged	1
my	1
estate,	1
I	1
have	1
given	1
up	1
my	1
comforts,	1
and	1
committed	1
myself	1
to	1
the	1
arms	1
of	1
Fortune,	1
to	1
bear	1
me	1
whithersoever	1
she	1
may	1
please.	1
My	1
desire	1
was	1
to	1
bring	1
to	1
life	1
again	1
knight-errantry,	1
now	1
dead,	1
and	1
for	1
some	1
time	1
past,	1
stumbling	1
here,	1
falling	1
there,	1
now	1
coming	1
down	1
headlong,	1
now	1
raising	1
myself	1
up	1
again,	1
I	1
have	1
carried	1
out	1
a	1
great	1
portion	1
of	1
my	1
design,	1
succouring	1
widows,	1
protecting	1
maidens,	1
and	1
giving	1
aid	1
to	1
wives,	1
orphans,	1
and	1
minors,	1
the	1
proper	1
and	1
natural	1
duty	1
of	1
knights-errant;	1
and,	1
therefore,	1
because	1
of	1
my	1
many	1
valiant	1
and	1
Christian	1
achievements,	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
already	1
found	1
worthy	1
to	1
make	1
my	1
way	1
in	1
print	1
to	1
well-nigh	1
all,	1
or	1
most,	1
of	1
the	1
nations	1
of	1
the	1
earth.	1
Thirty	1
thousand	1
volumes	1
of	1
my	1
history	1
have	1
been	1
printed,	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
on	1
the	1
high-road	1
to	1
be	1
printed	1
thirty	1
thousand	1
thousands	1
of	1
times,	1
if	1
heaven	1
does	1
not	1
put	1
a	1
stop	1
to	1
it.	1
In	1
short,	1
to	1
sum	1
up	1
all	1
in	1
a	1
few	1
words,	1
or	1
in	1
a	1
single	1
one,	1
I	1
may	1
tell	1
you	1
I	1
am	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
of	1
La	1
Mancha,	1
otherwise	1
called	1
‘The	1
Knight	1
of	1
the	1
Rueful	1
Countenance;’	1
for	1
though	1
self-praise	1
is	1
degrading,	1
I	1
must	1
perforce	1
sound	1
my	1
own	1
sometimes,	1
that	1
is	1
to	1
say,	1
when	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
one	1
at	1
hand	1
to	1
do	1
it	1
for	1
me.	1
So	1
that,	1
gentle	1
sir,	1
neither	1
this	1
horse,	1
nor	1
this	1
lance,	1
nor	1
this	1
shield,	1
nor	1
this	1
squire,	1
nor	1
all	1
these	1
arms	1
put	1
together,	1
nor	1
the	1
sallowness	1
of	1
my	1
countenance,	1
nor	1
my	1
gaunt	1
leanness,	1
will	1
henceforth	1
astonish	1
you,	1
now	1
that	1
you	1
know	1
who	1
I	1
am	1
and	1
what	1
profession	1
I	1
follow.”	1
With	1
these	1
words	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
held	1
his	1
peace,	1
and,	1
from	1
the	1
time	1
he	1
took	1
to	1
answer,	1
the	1
man	1
in	1
green	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
at	1
a	1
loss	1
for	1
a	1
reply;	1
after	1
a	1
long	1
pause,	1
however,	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
him,	1
“You	1
were	1
right	1
when	1
you	1
saw	1
curiosity	1
in	1
my	1
amazement,	1
sir	1
knight;	1
but	1
you	1
have	1
not	1
succeeded	1
in	1
removing	1
the	1
astonishment	1
I	1
feel	1
at	1
seeing	1
you;	1
for	1
although	1
you	1
say,	1
señor,	1
that	1
knowing	1
who	1
you	1
are	1
ought	1
to	1
remove	1
it,	1
it	1
has	1
not	1
done	1
so;	1
on	1
the	1
contrary,	1
now	1
that	1
I	1
know,	1
I	1
am	1
left	1
more	1
amazed	1
and	1
astonished	1
than	1
before.	1
What!	1
is	1
it	1
possible	1
that	1
there	1
are	1
knights-errant	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
in	1
these	1
days,	1
and	1
histories	1
of	1
real	1
chivalry	1
printed?	1
I	1
cannot	1
realise	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
there	1
can	1
be	1
anyone	1
on	1
earth	1
now-a-days	1
who	1
aids	1
widows,	1
or	1
protects	1
maidens,	1
or	1
defends	1
wives,	1
or	1
succours	1
orphans;	1
nor	1
should	1
I	1
believe	1
it	1
had	1
I	1
not	1
seen	1
it	1
in	1
your	1
worship	1
with	1
my	1
own	1
eyes.	1
Blessed	1
be	1
heaven!	1
for	1
by	1
means	1
of	1
this	1
history	1
of	1
your	1
noble	1
and	1
genuine	1
chivalrous	1
deeds,	1
which	1
you	1
say	1
has	1
been	1
printed,	1
the	1
countless	1
stories	1
of	1
fictitious	1
knights-errant	1
with	1
which	1
the	1
world	1
is	1
filled,	1
so	1
much	1
to	1
the	1
injury	1
of	1
morality	1
and	1
the	1
prejudice	1
and	1
discredit	1
of	1
good	1
histories,	1
will	1
have	1
been	1
driven	1
into	1
oblivion.”	1
“There	1
is	1
a	1
good	1
deal	1
to	1
be	1
said	1
on	1
that	1
point,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“as	1
to	1
whether	1
the	1
histories	1
of	1
the	1
knights-errant	1
are	1
fiction	1
or	1
not.”	1
“Why,	1
is	1
there	1
anyone	1
who	1
doubts	1
that	1
those	1
histories	1
are	1
false?”	1
said	1
the	1
man	1
in	1
green.	1
“I	1
doubt	1
it,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“but	1
never	1
mind	1
that	1
just	1
now;	1
if	1
our	1
journey	1
lasts	1
long	1
enough,	1
I	1
trust	1
in	1
God	1
I	1
shall	1
show	1
your	1
worship	1
that	1
you	1
do	1
wrong	1
in	1
going	1
with	1
the	1
stream	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
regard	1
it	1
as	1
a	1
matter	1
of	1
certainty	1
that	1
they	1
are	1
not	1
true.”	1
From	1
this	1
last	1
observation	1
of	1
Don	1
Quixote’s,	1
the	1
traveller	1
began	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
suspicion	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
some	1
crazy	1
being,	1
and	1
was	1
waiting	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
confirm	1
it	1
by	1
something	1
further;	1
but	1
before	1
they	1
could	1
turn	1
to	1
any	1
new	1
subject	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
begged	1
him	1
to	1
tell	1
him	1
who	1
he	1
was,	1
since	1
he	1
himself	1
had	1
rendered	1
account	1
of	1
his	1
station	1
and	1
life.	1
To	1
this,	1
he	1
in	1
the	1
green	1
gaban	1
replied	1
“I,	1
Sir	1
Knight	1
of	1
the	1
Rueful	1
Countenance,	1
am	1
a	1
gentleman	1
by	1
birth,	1
native	1
of	1
the	1
village	1
where,	1
please	1
God,	1
we	1
are	1
going	1
to	1
dine	1
to-day;	1
I	1
am	1
more	1
than	1
fairly	1
well	1
off,	1
and	1
my	1
name	1
is	1
Don	1
Diego	1
de	1
Miranda.	1
I	1
pass	1
my	1
life	1
with	1
my	1
wife,	1
children,	1
and	1
friends;	1
my	1
pursuits	1
are	1
hunting	1
and	1
fishing,	1
but	1
I	1
keep	1
neither	1
hawks	1
nor	1
greyhounds,	1
nothing	1
but	1
a	1
tame	1
partridge	1
or	1
a	1
bold	1
ferret	1
or	1
two;	1
I	1
have	1
six	1
dozen	1
or	1
so	1
of	1
books,	1
some	1
in	1
our	1
mother	1
tongue,	1
some	1
Latin,	1
some	1
of	1
them	1
history,	1
others	1
devotional;	1
those	1
of	1
chivalry	1
have	1
not	1
as	1
yet	1
crossed	1
the	1
threshold	1
of	1
my	1
door;	1
I	1
am	1
more	1
given	1
to	1
turning	1
over	1
the	1
profane	1
than	1
the	1
devotional,	1
so	1
long	1
as	1
they	1
are	1
books	1
of	1
honest	1
entertainment	1
that	1
charm	1
by	1
their	1
style	1
and	1
attract	1
and	1
interest	1
by	1
the	1
invention	1
they	1
display,	1
though	1
of	1
these	1
there	1
are	1
very	1
few	1
in	1
Spain.	1
Sometimes	1
I	1
dine	1
with	1
my	1
neighbours	1
and	1
friends,	1
and	1
often	1
invite	1
them;	1
my	1
entertainments	1
are	1
neat	1
and	1
well	1
served	1
without	1
stint	1
of	1
anything.	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
taste	1
for	1
tattle,	1
nor	1
do	1
I	1
allow	1
tattling	1
in	1
my	1
presence;	1
I	1
pry	1
not	1
into	1
my	1
neighbours’	1
lives,	1
nor	1
have	1
I	1
lynx-eyes	1
for	1
what	1
others	1
do.	1
I	1
hear	1
mass	1
every	1
day;	1
I	1
share	1
my	1
substance	1
with	1
the	1
poor,	1
making	1
no	1
display	1
of	1
good	1
works,	1
lest	1
I	1
let	1
hypocrisy	1
and	1
vainglory,	1
those	1
enemies	1
that	1
subtly	1
take	1
possession	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
watchful	1
heart,	1
find	1
an	1
entrance	1
into	1
mine.	1
I	1
strive	1
to	1
make	1
peace	1
between	1
those	1
whom	1
I	1
know	1
to	1
be	1
at	1
variance;	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
devoted	1
servant	1
of	1
Our	1
Lady,	1
and	1
my	1
trust	1
is	1
ever	1
in	1
the	1
infinite	1
mercy	1
of	1
God	1
our	1
Lord.”	1
Sancho	1
listened	1
with	1
the	1
greatest	1
attention	1
to	1
the	1
account	1
of	1
the	1
gentleman’s	1
life	1
and	1
occupation;	1
and	1
thinking	1
it	1
a	1
good	1
and	1
a	1
holy	1
life,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
who	1
led	1
it	1
ought	1
to	1
work	1
miracles,	1
he	1
threw	1
himself	1
off	1
Dapple,	1
and	1
running	1
in	1
haste	1
seized	1
his	1
right	1
stirrup	1
and	1
kissed	1
his	1
foot	1
again	1
and	1
again	1
with	1
a	1
devout	1
heart	1
and	1
almost	1
with	1
tears.	1
Seeing	1
this	1
the	1
gentleman	1
asked	1
him,	1
“What	1
are	1
you	1
about,	1
brother?	1
What	1
are	1
these	1
kisses	1
for?”	1
“Let	1
me	1
kiss,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“for	1
I	1
think	1
your	1
worship	1
is	1
the	1
first	1
saint	1
in	1
the	1
saddle	1
I	1
ever	1
saw	1
all	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
my	1
life.”	1
“I	1
am	1
no	1
saint,”	1
replied	1
the	1
gentleman,	1
“but	1
a	1
great	1
sinner;	1
but	1
you	1
are,	1
brother,	1
for	1
you	1
must	1
be	1
a	1
good	1
fellow,	1
as	1
your	1
simplicity	1
shows.”	1
Sancho	1
went	1
back	1
and	1
regained	1
his	1
pack-saddle,	1
having	1
extracted	1
a	1
laugh	1
from	1
his	1
master’s	1
profound	1
melancholy,	1
and	1
excited	1
fresh	1
amazement	1
in	1
Don	1
Diego.	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
then	1
asked	1
him	1
how	1
many	1
children	1
he	1
had,	1
and	1
observed	1
that	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
things	1
wherein	1
the	1
ancient	1
philosophers,	1
who	1
were	1
without	1
the	1
true	1
knowledge	1
of	1
God,	1
placed	1
the	1
_summum	1
bonum_	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
gifts	1
of	1
nature,	1
in	1
those	1
of	1
fortune,	1
in	1
having	1
many	1
friends,	1
and	1
many	1
and	1
good	1
children.	1
“I,	1
Señor	1
Don	1
Quixote,”	1
answered	1
the	1
gentleman,	1
“have	1
one	1
son,	1
without	1
whom,	1
perhaps,	1
I	1
should	1
count	1
myself	1
happier	1
than	1
I	1
am,	1
not	1
because	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
bad	1
son,	1
but	1
because	1
he	1
is	1
not	1
so	1
good	1
as	1
I	1
could	1
wish.	1
He	1
is	1
eighteen	1
years	1
of	1
age;	1
he	1
has	1
been	1
for	1
six	1
at	1
Salamanca	1
studying	1
Latin	1
and	1
Greek,	1
and	1
when	1
I	1
wished	1
him	1
to	1
turn	1
to	1
the	1
study	1
of	1
other	1
sciences	1
I	1
found	1
him	1
so	1
wrapped	1
up	1
in	1
that	1
of	1
poetry	1
(if	1
that	1
can	1
be	1
called	1
a	1
science)	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
getting	1
him	1
to	1
take	1
kindly	1
to	1
the	1
law,	1
which	1
I	1
wished	1
him	1
to	1
study,	1
or	1
to	1
theology,	1
the	1
queen	1
of	1
them	1
all.	1
I	1
would	1
like	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
an	1
honour	1
to	1
his	1
family,	1
as	1
we	1
live	1
in	1
days	1
when	1
our	1
kings	1
liberally	1
reward	1
learning	1
that	1
is	1
virtuous	1
and	1
worthy;	1
for	1
learning	1
without	1
virtue	1
is	1
a	1
pearl	1
on	1
a	1
dunghill.	1
He	1
spends	1
the	1
whole	1
day	1
in	1
settling	1
whether	1
Homer	1
expressed	1
himself	1
correctly	1
or	1
not	1
in	1
such	1
and	1
such	1
a	1
line	1
of	1
the	1
Iliad,	1
whether	1
Martial	1
was	1
indecent	1
or	1
not	1
in	1
such	1
and	1
such	1
an	1
epigram,	1
whether	1
such	1
and	1
such	1
lines	1
of	1
Virgil	1
are	1
to	1
be	1
understood	1
in	1
this	1
way	1
or	1
in	1
that;	1
in	1
short,	1
all	1
his	1
talk	1
is	1
of	1
the	1
works	1
of	1
these	1
poets,	1
and	1
those	1
of	1
Horace,	1
Perseus,	1
Juvenal,	1
and	1
Tibullus;	1
for	1
of	1
the	1
moderns	1
in	1
our	1
own	1
language	1
he	1
makes	1
no	1
great	1
account;	1
but	1
with	1
all	1
his	1
seeming	1
indifference	1
to	1
Spanish	1
poetry,	1
just	1
now	1
his	1
thoughts	1
are	1
absorbed	1
in	1
making	1
a	1
gloss	1
on	1
four	1
lines	1
that	1
have	1
been	1
sent	1
him	1
from	1
Salamanca,	1
which	1
I	1
suspect	1
are	1
for	1
some	1
poetical	1
tournament.”	1
To	1
all	1
this	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
said	1
in	1
reply,	1
“Children,	1
señor,	1
are	1
portions	1
of	1
their	1
parents’	1
bowels,	1
and	1
therefore,	1
be	1
they	1
good	1
or	1
bad,	1
are	1
to	1
be	1
loved	1
as	1
we	1
love	1
the	1
souls	1
that	1
give	1
us	1
life;	1
it	1
is	1
for	1
the	1
parents	1
to	1
guide	1
them	1
from	1
infancy	1
in	1
the	1
ways	1
of	1
virtue,	1
propriety,	1
and	1
worthy	1
Christian	1
conduct,	1
so	1
that	1
when	1
grown	1
up	1
they	1
may	1
be	1
the	1
staff	1
of	1
their	1
parents’	1
old	1
age,	1
and	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
their	1
posterity;	1
and	1
to	1
force	1
them	1
to	1
study	1
this	1
or	1
that	1
science	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
think	1
wise,	1
though	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
no	1
harm	1
to	1
persuade	1
them;	1
and	1
when	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
need	1
to	1
study	1
for	1
the	1
sake	1
of	1
_pane	1
lucrando_,	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
student’s	1
good	1
fortune	1
that	1
heaven	1
has	1
given	1
him	1
parents	1
who	1
provide	1
him	1
with	1
it,	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
my	1
advice	1
to	1
them	1
to	1
let	1
him	1
pursue	1
whatever	1
science	1
they	1
may	1
see	1
him	1
most	1
inclined	1
to;	1
and	1
though	1
that	1
of	1
poetry	1
is	1
less	1
useful	1
than	1
pleasurable,	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
that	1
bring	1
discredit	1
upon	1
the	1
possessor.	1
Poetry,	1
gentle	1
sir,	1
is,	1
as	1
I	1
take	1
it,	1
like	1
a	1
tender	1
young	1
maiden	1
of	1
supreme	1
beauty,	1
to	1
array,	1
bedeck,	1
and	1
adorn	1
whom	1
is	1
the	1
task	1
of	1
several	1
other	1
maidens,	1
who	1
are	1
all	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
sciences;	1
and	1
she	1
must	1
avail	1
herself	1
of	1
the	1
help	1
of	1
all,	1
and	1
all	1
derive	1
their	1
lustre	1
from	1
her.	1
But	1
this	1
maiden	1
will	1
not	1
bear	1
to	1
be	1
handled,	1
nor	1
dragged	1
through	1
the	1
streets,	1
nor	1
exposed	1
either	1
at	1
the	1
corners	1
of	1
the	1
market-places,	1
or	1
in	1
the	1
closets	1
of	1
palaces.	1
She	1
is	1
the	1
product	1
of	1
an	1
Alchemy	1
of	1
such	1
virtue	1
that	1
he	1
who	1
is	1
able	1
to	1
practise	1
it,	1
will	1
turn	1
her	1
into	1
pure	1
gold	1
of	1
inestimable	1
worth.	1
He	1
that	1
possesses	1
her	1
must	1
keep	1
her	1
within	1
bounds,	1
not	1
permitting	1
her	1
to	1
break	1
out	1
in	1
ribald	1
satires	1
or	1
soulless	1
sonnets.	1
She	1
must	1
on	1
no	1
account	1
be	1
offered	1
for	1
sale,	1
unless,	1
indeed,	1
it	1
be	1
in	1
heroic	1
poems,	1
moving	1
tragedies,	1
or	1
sprightly	1
and	1
ingenious	1
comedies.	1
She	1
must	1
not	1
be	1
touched	1
by	1
the	1
buffoons,	1
nor	1
by	1
the	1
ignorant	1
vulgar,	1
incapable	1
of	1
comprehending	1
or	1
appreciating	1
her	1
hidden	1
treasures.	1
And	1
do	1
not	1
suppose,	1
señor,	1
that	1
I	1
apply	1
the	1
term	1
vulgar	1
here	1
merely	1
to	1
plebeians	1
and	1
the	1
lower	1
orders;	1
for	1
everyone	1
who	1
is	1
ignorant,	1
be	1
he	1
lord	1
or	1
prince,	1
may	1
and	1
should	1
be	1
included	1
among	1
the	1
vulgar.	1
He,	1
then,	1
who	1
shall	1
embrace	1
and	1
cultivate	1
poetry	1
under	1
the	1
conditions	1
I	1
have	1
named,	1
shall	1
become	1
famous,	1
and	1
his	1
name	1
honoured	1
throughout	1
all	1
the	1
civilised	1
nations	1
of	1
the	1
earth.	1
And	1
with	1
regard	1
to	1
what	1
you	1
say,	1
señor,	1
of	1
your	1
son	1
having	1
no	1
great	1
opinion	1
of	1
Spanish	1
poetry,	1
I	1
am	1
inclined	1
to	1
think	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
not	1
quite	1
right	1
there,	1
and	1
for	1
this	1
reason:	1
the	1
great	1
poet	1
Homer	1
did	1
not	1
write	1
in	1
Latin,	1
because	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
Greek,	1
nor	1
did	1
Virgil	1
write	1
in	1
Greek,	1
because	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
Latin;	1
in	1
short,	1
all	1
the	1
ancient	1
poets	1
wrote	1
in	1
the	1
language	1
they	1
imbibed	1
with	1
their	1
mother’s	1
milk,	1
and	1
never	1
went	1
in	1
quest	1
of	1
foreign	1
ones	1
to	1
express	1
their	1
sublime	1
conceptions;	1
and	1
that	1
being	1
so,	1
the	1
usage	1
should	1
in	1
justice	1
extend	1
to	1
all	1
nations,	1
and	1
the	1
German	1
poet	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
undervalued	1
because	1
he	1
writes	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
language,	1
nor	1
the	1
Castilian,	1
nor	1
even	1
the	1
Biscayan,	1
for	1
writing	1
in	1
his.	1
But	1
your	1
son,	1
señor,	1
I	1
suspect,	1
is	1
not	1
prejudiced	1
against	1
Spanish	1
poetry,	1
but	1
against	1
those	1
poets	1
who	1
are	1
mere	1
Spanish	1
verse	1
writers,	1
without	1
any	1
knowledge	1
of	1
other	1
languages	1
or	1
sciences	1
to	1
adorn	1
and	1
give	1
life	1
and	1
vigour	1
to	1
their	1
natural	1
inspiration;	1
and	1
yet	1
even	1
in	1
this	1
he	1
may	1
be	1
wrong;	1
for,	1
according	1
to	1
a	1
true	1
belief,	1
a	1
poet	1
is	1
born	1
one;	1
that	1
is	1
to	1
say,	1
the	1
poet	1
by	1
nature	1
comes	1
forth	1
a	1
poet	1
from	1
his	1
mother’s	1
womb;	1
and	1
following	1
the	1
bent	1
that	1
heaven	1
has	1
bestowed	1
upon	1
him,	1
without	1
the	1
aid	1
of	1
study	1
or	1
art,	1
he	1
produces	1
things	1
that	1
show	1
how	1
truly	1
he	1
spoke	1
who	1
said,	1
‘_Est	1
Deus	1
in	1
nobis_,’	1
etc.	1
At	1
the	1
same	1
time,	1
I	1
say	1
that	1
the	1
poet	1
by	1
nature	1
who	1
calls	1
in	1
art	1
to	1
his	1
aid	1
will	1
be	1
a	1
far	1
better	1
poet,	1
and	1
will	1
surpass	1
him	1
who	1
tries	1
to	1
be	1
one	1
relying	1
upon	1
his	1
knowledge	1
of	1
art	1
alone.	1
The	1
reason	1
is,	1
that	1
art	1
does	1
not	1
surpass	1
nature,	1
but	1
only	1
brings	1
it	1
to	1
perfection;	1
and	1
thus,	1
nature	1
combined	1
with	1
art,	1
and	1
art	1
with	1
nature,	1
will	1
produce	1
a	1
perfect	1
poet.	1
To	1
bring	1
my	1
argument	1
to	1
a	1
close,	1
I	1
would	1
say	1
then,	1
gentle	1
sir,	1
let	1
your	1
son	1
go	1
on	1
as	1
his	1
star	1
leads	1
him,	1
for	1
being	1
so	1
studious	1
as	1
he	1
seems	1
to	1
be,	1
and	1
having	1
already	1
successfully	1
surmounted	1
the	1
first	1
step	1
of	1
the	1
sciences,	1
which	1
is	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
languages,	1
with	1
their	1
help	1
he	1
will	1
by	1
his	1
own	1
exertions	1
reach	1
the	1
summit	1
of	1
polite	1
literature,	1
which	1
so	1
well	1
becomes	1
an	1
independent	1
gentleman,	1
and	1
adorns,	1
honours,	1
and	1
distinguishes	1
him,	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
the	1
mitre	1
does	1
the	1
bishop,	1
or	1
the	1
gown	1
the	1
learned	1
counsellor.	1
If	1
your	1
son	1
write	1
satires	1
reflecting	1
on	1
the	1
honour	1
of	1
others,	1
chide	1
and	1
correct	1
him,	1
and	1
tear	1
them	1
up;	1
but	1
if	1
he	1
compose	1
discourses	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
rebukes	1
vice	1
in	1
general,	1
in	1
the	1
style	1
of	1
Horace,	1
and	1
with	1
elegance	1
like	1
his,	1
commend	1
him;	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
legitimate	1
for	1
a	1
poet	1
to	1
write	1
against	1
envy	1
and	1
lash	1
the	1
envious	1
in	1
his	1
verse,	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
vices	1
too,	1
provided	1
he	1
does	1
not	1
single	1
out	1
individuals;	1
there	1
are,	1
however,	1
poets	1
who,	1
for	1
the	1
sake	1
of	1
saying	1
something	1
spiteful,	1
would	1
run	1
the	1
risk	1
of	1
being	1
banished	1
to	1
the	1
coast	1
of	1
Pontus.	1
If	1
the	1
poet	1
be	1
pure	1
in	1
his	1
morals,	1
he	1
will	1
be	1
pure	1
in	1
his	1
verses	1
too;	1
the	1
pen	1
is	1
the	1
tongue	1
of	1
the	1
mind,	1
and	1
as	1
the	1
thought	1
engendered	1
there,	1
so	1
will	1
be	1
the	1
things	1
that	1
it	1
writes	1
down.	1
And	1
when	1
kings	1
and	1
princes	1
observe	1
this	1
marvellous	1
science	1
of	1
poetry	1
in	1
wise,	1
virtuous,	1
and	1
thoughtful	1
subjects,	1
they	1
honour,	1
value,	1
exalt	1
them,	1
and	1
even	1
crown	1
them	1
with	1
the	1
leaves	1
of	1
that	1
tree	1
which	1
the	1
thunderbolt	1
strikes	1
not,	1
as	1
if	1
to	1
show	1
that	1
they	1
whose	1
brows	1
are	1
honoured	1
and	1
adorned	1
with	1
such	1
a	1
crown	1
are	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
assailed	1
by	1
anyone.”	1
He	1
of	1
the	1
green	1
gaban	1
was	1
filled	1
with	1
astonishment	1
at	1
Don	1
Quixote’s	1
argument,	1
so	1
much	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
abandon	1
the	1
notion	1
he	1
had	1
taken	1
up	1
about	1
his	1
being	1
crazy.	1
But	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
discourse,	1
it	1
being	1
not	1
very	1
much	1
to	1
his	1
taste,	1
Sancho	1
had	1
turned	1
aside	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
road	1
to	1
beg	1
a	1
little	1
milk	1
from	1
some	1
shepherds,	1
who	1
were	1
milking	1
their	1
ewes	1
hard	1
by;	1
and	1
just	1
as	1
the	1
gentleman,	1
highly	1
pleased,	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
renew	1
the	1
conversation,	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
raising	1
his	1
head,	1
perceived	1
a	1
cart	1
covered	1
with	1
royal	1
flags	1
coming	1
along	1
the	1
road	1
they	1
were	1
travelling;	1
and	1
persuaded	1
that	1
this	1
must	1
be	1
some	1
new	1
adventure,	1
he	1
called	1
aloud	1
to	1
Sancho	1
to	1
come	1
and	1
bring	1
him	1
his	1
helmet.	1
Sancho,	1
hearing	1
himself	1
called,	1
quitted	1
the	1
shepherds,	1
and,	1
prodding	1
Dapple	1
vigorously,	1
came	1
up	1
to	1
his	1
master,	1
to	1
whom	1
there	1
fell	1
a	1
terrific	1
and	1
desperate	1
adventure.	1

The	1
history	1
tells	1
that	1
when	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
called	1
out	1
to	1
Sancho	1
to	1
bring	1
him	1
his	1
helmet,	1
Sancho	1
was	1
buying	1
some	1
curds	1
the	1
shepherds	1
agreed	1
to	1
sell	1
him,	1
and	1
flurried	1
by	1
the	1
great	1
haste	1
his	1
master	1
was	1
in	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
what	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
them	1
or	1
what	1
to	1
carry	1
them	1
in;	1
so,	1
not	1
to	1
lose	1
them,	1
for	1
he	1
had	1
already	1
paid	1
for	1
them,	1
he	1
thought	1
it	1
best	1
to	1
throw	1
them	1
into	1
his	1
master’s	1
helmet,	1
and	1
acting	1
on	1
this	1
bright	1
idea	1
he	1
went	1
to	1
see	1
what	1
his	1
master	1
wanted	1
with	1
him.	1
He,	1
as	1
he	1
approached,	1
exclaimed	1
to	1
him:	1
“Give	1
me	1
that	1
helmet,	1
my	1
friend,	1
for	1
either	1
I	1
know	1
little	1
of	1
adventures,	1
or	1
what	1
I	1
observe	1
yonder	1
is	1
one	1
that	1
will,	1
and	1
does,	1
call	1
upon	1
me	1
to	1
arm	1
myself.”	1
He	1
of	1
the	1
green	1
gaban,	1
on	1
hearing	1
this,	1
looked	1
in	1
all	1
directions,	1
but	1
could	1
perceive	1
nothing,	1
except	1
a	1
cart	1
coming	1
towards	1
them	1
with	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
small	1
flags,	1
which	1
led	1
him	1
to	1
conclude	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
carrying	1
treasure	1
of	1
the	1
King’s,	1
and	1
he	1
said	1
so	1
to	1
Don	1
Quixote.	1
He,	1
however,	1
would	1
not	1
believe	1
him,	1
being	1
always	1
persuaded	1
and	1
convinced	1
that	1
all	1
that	1
happened	1
to	1
him	1
must	1
be	1
adventures	1
and	1
still	1
more	1
adventures;	1
so	1
he	1
replied	1
to	1
the	1
gentleman,	1
“He	1
who	1
is	1
prepared	1
has	1
his	1
battle	1
half	1
fought;	1
nothing	1
is	1
lost	1
by	1
my	1
preparing	1
myself,	1
for	1
I	1
know	1
by	1
experience	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
enemies,	1
visible	1
and	1
invisible,	1
and	1
I	1
know	1
not	1
when,	1
or	1
where,	1
or	1
at	1
what	1
moment,	1
or	1
in	1
what	1
shapes	1
they	1
will	1
attack	1
me;”	1
and	1
turning	1
to	1
Sancho,	1
he	1
called	1
for	1
his	1
helmet;	1
and	1
Sancho,	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
no	1
time	1
to	1
take	1
out	1
the	1
curds,	1
had	1
to	1
give	1
it	1
just	1
as	1
it	1
was.	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
took	1
it,	1
and	1
without	1
perceiving	1
what	1
was	1
in	1
it	1
thrust	1
it	1
down	1
in	1
hot	1
haste	1
upon	1
his	1
head;	1
but	1
as	1
the	1
curds	1
were	1
pressed	1
and	1
squeezed	1
the	1
whey	1
began	1
to	1
run	1
all	1
over	1
his	1
face	1
and	1
beard,	1
whereat	1
he	1
was	1
so	1
startled	1
that	1
he	1
cried	1
out	1
to	1
Sancho:	1
“Sancho,	1
what’s	1
this?	1
I	1
think	1
my	1
head	1
is	1
softening,	1
or	1
my	1
brains	1
are	1
melting,	1
or	1
I	1
am	1
sweating	1
from	1
head	1
to	1
foot!	1
If	1
I	1
am	1
sweating	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
indeed	1
from	1
fear.	1
I	1
am	1
convinced	1
beyond	1
a	1
doubt	1
that	1
the	1
adventure	1
which	1
is	1
about	1
to	1
befall	1
me	1
is	1
a	1
terrible	1
one.	1
Give	1
me	1
something	1
to	1
wipe	1
myself	1
with,	1
if	1
thou	1
hast	1
it,	1
for	1
this	1
profuse	1
sweat	1
is	1
blinding	1
me.”	1
Sancho	1
held	1
his	1
tongue,	1
and	1
gave	1
him	1
a	1
cloth,	1
and	1
gave	1
thanks	1
to	1
God	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
that	1
his	1
master	1
had	1
not	1
found	1
out	1
what	1
was	1
the	1
matter.	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
then	1
wiped	1
himself,	1
and	1
took	1
off	1
his	1
helmet	1
to	1
see	1
what	1
it	1
was	1
that	1
made	1
his	1
head	1
feel	1
so	1
cool,	1
and	1
seeing	1
all	1
that	1
white	1
mash	1
inside	1
his	1
helmet	1
he	1
put	1
it	1
to	1
his	1
nose,	1
and	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
smelt	1
it	1
he	1
exclaimed:	1
“By	1
the	1
life	1
of	1
my	1
lady	1
Dulcinea	1
del	1
Toboso,	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
curds	1
thou	1
hast	1
put	1
here,	1
thou	1
treacherous,	1
impudent,	1
ill-mannered	1
squire!”	1
To	1
which,	1
with	1
great	1
composure	1
and	1
pretended	1
innocence,	1
Sancho	1
replied,	1
“If	1
they	1
are	1
curds	1
let	1
me	1
have	1
them,	1
your	1
worship,	1
and	1
I’ll	1
eat	1
them;	1
but	1
let	1
the	1
devil	1
eat	1
them,	1
for	1
it	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
he	1
who	1
put	1
them	1
there.	1
I	1
dare	1
to	1
dirty	1
your	1
helmet!	1
You	1
have	1
guessed	1
the	1
offender	1
finely!	1
Faith,	1
sir,	1
by	1
the	1
light	1
God	1
gives	1
me,	1
it	1
seems	1
I	1
must	1
have	1
enchanters	1
too,	1
that	1
persecute	1
me	1
as	1
a	1
creature	1
and	1
limb	1
of	1
your	1
worship,	1
and	1
they	1
must	1
have	1
put	1
that	1
nastiness	1
there	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
provoke	1
your	1
patience	1
to	1
anger,	1
and	1
make	1
you	1
baste	1
my	1
ribs	1
as	1
you	1
are	1
wont	1
to	1
do.	1
Well,	1
this	1
time,	1
indeed,	1
they	1
have	1
missed	1
their	1
aim,	1
for	1
I	1
trust	1
to	1
my	1
master’s	1
good	1
sense	1
to	1
see	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
got	1
no	1
curds	1
or	1
milk,	1
or	1
anything	1
of	1
the	1
sort;	1
and	1
that	1
if	1
I	1
had	1
it	1
is	1
in	1
my	1
stomach	1
I	1
would	1
put	1
it	1
and	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
helmet.”	1
“May	1
be	1
so,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote.	1
All	1
this	1
the	1
gentleman	1
was	1
observing,	1
and	1
with	1
astonishment,	1
more	1
especially	1
when,	1
after	1
having	1
wiped	1
himself	1
clean,	1
his	1
head,	1
face,	1
beard,	1
and	1
helmet,	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
put	1
it	1
on,	1
and	1
settling	1
himself	1
firmly	1
in	1
his	1
stirrups,	1
easing	1
his	1
sword	1
in	1
the	1
scabbard,	1
and	1
grasping	1
his	1
lance,	1
he	1
cried,	1
“Now,	1
come	1
who	1
will,	1
here	1
am	1
I,	1
ready	1
to	1
try	1
conclusions	1
with	1
Satan	1
himself	1
in	1
person!”	1
By	1
this	1
time	1
the	1
cart	1
with	1
the	1
flags	1
had	1
come	1
up,	1
unattended	1
by	1
anyone	1
except	1
the	1
carter	1
on	1
a	1
mule,	1
and	1
a	1
man	1
sitting	1
in	1
front.	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
planted	1
himself	1
before	1
it	1
and	1
said,	1
“Whither	1
are	1
you	1
going,	1
brothers?	1
What	1
cart	1
is	1
this?	1
What	1
have	1
you	1
got	1
in	1
it?	1
What	1
flags	1
are	1
those?”	1
To	1
this	1
the	1
carter	1
replied,	1
“The	1
cart	1
is	1
mine;	1
what	1
is	1
in	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
pair	1
of	1
wild	1
caged	1
lions,	1
which	1
the	1
governor	1
of	1
Oran	1
is	1
sending	1
to	1
court	1
as	1
a	1
present	1
to	1
his	1
Majesty;	1
and	1
the	1
flags	1
are	1
our	1
lord	1
the	1
King’s,	1
to	1
show	1
that	1
what	1
is	1
here	1
is	1
his	1
property.”	1
“And	1
are	1
the	1
lions	1
large?”	1
asked	1
Don	1
Quixote.	1
“So	1
large,”	1
replied	1
the	1
man	1
who	1
sat	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
cart,	1
“that	1
larger,	1
or	1
as	1
large,	1
have	1
never	1
crossed	1
from	1
Africa	1
to	1
Spain;	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
keeper,	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
brought	1
over	1
others,	1
but	1
never	1
any	1
like	1
these.	1
They	1
are	1
male	1
and	1
female;	1
the	1
male	1
is	1
in	1
that	1
first	1
cage	1
and	1
the	1
female	1
in	1
the	1
one	1
behind,	1
and	1
they	1
are	1
hungry	1
now,	1
for	1
they	1
have	1
eaten	1
nothing	1
to-day,	1
so	1
let	1
your	1
worship	1
stand	1
aside,	1
for	1
we	1
must	1
make	1
haste	1
to	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
we	1
are	1
to	1
feed	1
them.”	1
Hereupon,	1
smiling	1
slightly,	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
exclaimed,	1
“Lion-whelps	1
to	1
me!	1
to	1
me	1
whelps	1
of	1
lions,	1
and	1
at	1
such	1
a	1
time!	1
Then,	1
by	1
God!	1
those	1
gentlemen	1
who	1
send	1
them	1
here	1
shall	1
see	1
if	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
man	1
to	1
be	1
frightened	1
by	1
lions.	1
Get	1
down,	1
my	1
good	1
fellow,	1
and	1
as	1
you	1
are	1
the	1
keeper	1
open	1
the	1
cages,	1
and	1
turn	1
me	1
out	1
those	1
beasts,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
this	1
plain	1
I	1
will	1
let	1
them	1
know	1
who	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
of	1
La	1
Mancha	1
is,	1
in	1
spite	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
teeth	1
of	1
the	1
enchanters	1
who	1
send	1
them	1
to	1
me.”	1
“So,	1
so,”	1
said	1
the	1
gentleman	1
to	1
himself	1
at	1
this;	1
“our	1
worthy	1
knight	1
has	1
shown	1
of	1
what	1
sort	1
he	1
is;	1
the	1
curds,	1
no	1
doubt,	1
have	1
softened	1
his	1
skull	1
and	1
brought	1
his	1
brains	1
to	1
a	1
head.”	1
At	1
this	1
instant	1
Sancho	1
came	1
up	1
to	1
him,	1
saying,	1
“Señor,	1
for	1
God’s	1
sake	1
do	1
something	1
to	1
keep	1
my	1
master,	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
from	1
tackling	1
these	1
lions;	1
for	1
if	1
he	1
does	1
they’ll	1
tear	1
us	1
all	1
to	1
pieces	1
here.”	1
“Is	1
your	1
master	1
then	1
so	1
mad,”	1
asked	1
the	1
gentleman,	1
“that	1
you	1
believe	1
and	1
are	1
afraid	1
he	1
will	1
engage	1
such	1
fierce	1
animals?”	1
“He	1
is	1
not	1
mad,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“but	1
he	1
is	1
venturesome.”	1
“I	1
will	1
prevent	1
it,”	1
said	1
the	1
gentleman;	1
and	1
going	1
over	1
to	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
who	1
was	1
insisting	1
upon	1
the	1
keeper’s	1
opening	1
the	1
cages,	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
him,	1
“Sir	1
knight,	1
knights-errant	1
should	1
attempt	1
adventures	1
which	1
encourage	1
the	1
hope	1
of	1
a	1
successful	1
issue,	1
not	1
those	1
which	1
entirely	1
withhold	1
it;	1
for	1
valour	1
that	1
trenches	1
upon	1
temerity	1
savours	1
rather	1
of	1
madness	1
than	1
of	1
courage;	1
moreover,	1
these	1
lions	1
do	1
not	1
come	1
to	1
oppose	1
you,	1
nor	1
do	1
they	1
dream	1
of	1
such	1
a	1
thing;	1
they	1
are	1
going	1
as	1
presents	1
to	1
his	1
Majesty,	1
and	1
it	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
right	1
to	1
stop	1
them	1
or	1
delay	1
their	1
journey.”	1
“Gentle	1
sir,”	1
replied	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“you	1
go	1
and	1
mind	1
your	1
tame	1
partridge	1
and	1
your	1
bold	1
ferret,	1
and	1
leave	1
everyone	1
to	1
manage	1
his	1
own	1
business;	1
this	1
is	1
mine,	1
and	1
I	1
know	1
whether	1
these	1
gentlemen	1
the	1
lions	1
come	1
to	1
me	1
or	1
not;”	1
and	1
then	1
turning	1
to	1
the	1
keeper	1
he	1
exclaimed,	1
“By	1
all	1
that’s	1
good,	1
sir	1
scoundrel,	1
if	1
you	1
don’t	1
open	1
the	1
cages	1
this	1
very	1
instant,	1
I’ll	1
pin	1
you	1
to	1
the	1
cart	1
with	1
this	1
lance.”	1
The	1
carter,	1
seeing	1
the	1
determination	1
of	1
this	1
apparition	1
in	1
armour,	1
said	1
to	1
him,	1
“Please	1
your	1
worship,	1
for	1
charity’s	1
sake,	1
señor,	1
let	1
me	1
unyoke	1
the	1
mules	1
and	1
place	1
myself	1
in	1
safety	1
along	1
with	1
them	1
before	1
the	1
lions	1
are	1
turned	1
out;	1
for	1
if	1
they	1
kill	1
them	1
on	1
me	1
I	1
am	1
ruined	1
for	1
life,	1
for	1
all	1
I	1
possess	1
is	1
this	1
cart	1
and	1
mules.”	1
“O	1
man	1
of	1
little	1
faith,”	1
replied	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“get	1
down	1
and	1
unyoke;	1
you	1
will	1
soon	1
see	1
that	1
you	1
are	1
exerting	1
yourself	1
for	1
nothing,	1
and	1
that	1
you	1
might	1
have	1
spared	1
yourself	1
the	1
trouble.”	1
The	1
carter	1
got	1
down	1
and	1
with	1
all	1
speed	1
unyoked	1
the	1
mules,	1
and	1
the	1
keeper	1
called	1
out	1
at	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
his	1
voice,	1
“I	1
call	1
all	1
here	1
to	1
witness	1
that	1
against	1
my	1
will	1
and	1
under	1
compulsion	1
I	1
open	1
the	1
cages	1
and	1
let	1
the	1
lions	1
loose,	1
and	1
that	1
I	1
warn	1
this	1
gentleman	1
that	1
he	1
will	1
be	1
accountable	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
harm	1
and	1
mischief	1
which	1
these	1
beasts	1
may	1
do,	1
and	1
for	1
my	1
salary	1
and	1
dues	1
as	1
well.	1
You,	1
gentlemen,	1
place	1
yourselves	1
in	1
safety	1
before	1
I	1
open,	1
for	1
I	1
know	1
they	1
will	1
do	1
me	1
no	1
harm.”	1
Once	1
more	1
the	1
gentleman	1
strove	1
to	1
persuade	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
not	1
to	1
do	1
such	1
a	1
mad	1
thing,	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
tempting	1
God	1
to	1
engage	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
piece	1
of	1
folly.	1
To	1
this,	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
replied	1
that	1
he	1
knew	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
about.	1
The	1
gentleman	1
in	1
return	1
entreated	1
him	1
to	1
reflect,	1
for	1
he	1
knew	1
he	1
was	1
under	1
a	1
delusion.	1
“Well,	1
señor,”	1
answered	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“if	1
you	1
do	1
not	1
like	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
spectator	1
of	1
this	1
tragedy,	1
as	1
in	1
your	1
opinion	1
it	1
will	1
be,	1
spur	1
your	1
flea-bitten	1
mare,	1
and	1
place	1
yourself	1
in	1
safety.”	1
Hearing	1
this,	1
Sancho	1
with	1
tears	1
in	1
his	1
eyes	1
entreated	1
him	1
to	1
give	1
up	1
an	1
enterprise	1
compared	1
with	1
which	1
the	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
windmills,	1
and	1
the	1
awful	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
fulling	1
mills,	1
and,	1
in	1
fact,	1
all	1
the	1
feats	1
he	1
had	1
attempted	1
in	1
the	1
whole	1
course	1
of	1
his	1
life,	1
were	1
cakes	1
and	1
fancy	1
bread.	1
“Look	1
ye,	1
señor,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“there’s	1
no	1
enchantment	1
here,	1
nor	1
anything	1
of	1
the	1
sort,	1
for	1
between	1
the	1
bars	1
and	1
chinks	1
of	1
the	1
cage	1
I	1
have	1
seen	1
the	1
paw	1
of	1
a	1
real	1
lion,	1
and	1
judging	1
by	1
that	1
I	1
reckon	1
the	1
lion	1
such	1
a	1
paw	1
could	1
belong	1
to	1
must	1
be	1
bigger	1
than	1
a	1
mountain.”	1
“Fear	1
at	1
any	1
rate,”	1
replied	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“will	1
make	1
him	1
look	1
bigger	1
to	1
thee	1
than	1
half	1
the	1
world.	1
Retire,	1
Sancho,	1
and	1
leave	1
me;	1
and	1
if	1
I	1
die	1
here	1
thou	1
knowest	1
our	1
old	1
compact;	1
thou	1
wilt	1
repair	1
to	1
Dulcinea—I	1
say	1
no	1
more.”	1
To	1
these	1
he	1
added	1
some	1
further	1
words	1
that	1
banished	1
all	1
hope	1
of	1
his	1
giving	1
up	1
his	1
insane	1
project.	1
He	1
of	1
the	1
green	1
gaban	1
would	1
have	1
offered	1
resistance,	1
but	1
he	1
found	1
himself	1
ill-matched	1
as	1
to	1
arms,	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
think	1
it	1
prudent	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
blows	1
with	1
a	1
madman,	1
for	1
such	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
now	1
showed	1
himself	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
every	1
respect;	1
and	1
the	1
latter,	1
renewing	1
his	1
commands	1
to	1
the	1
keeper	1
and	1
repeating	1
his	1
threats,	1
gave	1
warning	1
to	1
the	1
gentleman	1
to	1
spur	1
his	1
mare,	1
Sancho	1
his	1
Dapple,	1
and	1
the	1
carter	1
his	1
mules,	1
all	1
striving	1
to	1
get	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
cart	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
they	1
could	1
before	1
the	1
lions	1
broke	1
loose.	1
Sancho	1
was	1
weeping	1
over	1
his	1
master’s	1
death,	1
for	1
this	1
time	1
he	1
firmly	1
believed	1
it	1
was	1
in	1
store	1
for	1
him	1
from	1
the	1
claws	1
of	1
the	1
lions;	1
and	1
he	1
cursed	1
his	1
fate	1
and	1
called	1
it	1
an	1
unlucky	1
hour	1
when	1
he	1
thought	1
of	1
taking	1
service	1
with	1
him	1
again;	1
but	1
with	1
all	1
his	1
tears	1
and	1
lamentations	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
forget	1
to	1
thrash	1
Dapple	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
put	1
a	1
good	1
space	1
between	1
himself	1
and	1
the	1
cart.	1
The	1
keeper,	1
seeing	1
that	1
the	1
fugitives	1
were	1
now	1
some	1
distance	1
off,	1
once	1
more	1
entreated	1
and	1
warned	1
him	1
as	1
before;	1
but	1
he	1
replied	1
that	1
he	1
heard	1
him,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
need	1
not	1
trouble	1
himself	1
with	1
any	1
further	1
warnings	1
or	1
entreaties,	1
as	1
they	1
would	1
be	1
fruitless,	1
and	1
bade	1
him	1
make	1
haste.	1
During	1
the	1
delay	1
that	1
occurred	1
while	1
the	1
keeper	1
was	1
opening	1
the	1
first	1
cage,	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
was	1
considering	1
whether	1
it	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
well	1
to	1
do	1
battle	1
on	1
foot,	1
instead	1
of	1
on	1
horseback,	1
and	1
finally	1
resolved	1
to	1
fight	1
on	1
foot,	1
fearing	1
that	1
Rocinante	1
might	1
take	1
fright	1
at	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
lions;	1
he	1
therefore	1
sprang	1
off	1
his	1
horse,	1
flung	1
his	1
lance	1
aside,	1
braced	1
his	1
buckler	1
on	1
his	1
arm,	1
and	1
drawing	1
his	1
sword,	1
advanced	1
slowly	1
with	1
marvellous	1
intrepidity	1
and	1
resolute	1
courage,	1
to	1
plant	1
himself	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
the	1
cart,	1
commending	1
himself	1
with	1
all	1
his	1
heart	1
to	1
God	1
and	1
to	1
his	1
lady	1
Dulcinea.	1
It	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
observed,	1
that	1
on	1
coming	1
to	1
this	1
passage,	1
the	1
author	1
of	1
this	1
veracious	1
history	1
breaks	1
out	1
into	1
exclamations.	1
“O	1
doughty	1
Don	1
Quixote!	1
high-mettled	1
past	1
extolling!	1
Mirror,	1
wherein	1
all	1
the	1
heroes	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
may	1
see	1
themselves!	1
Second	1
modern	1
Don	1
Manuel	1
de	1
Leon,	1
once	1
the	1
glory	1
and	1
honour	1
of	1
Spanish	1
knighthood!	1
In	1
what	1
words	1
shall	1
I	1
describe	1
this	1
dread	1
exploit,	1
by	1
what	1
language	1
shall	1
I	1
make	1
it	1
credible	1
to	1
ages	1
to	1
come,	1
what	1
eulogies	1
are	1
there	1
unmeet	1
for	1
thee,	1
though	1
they	1
be	1
hyperboles	1
piled	1
on	1
hyperboles!	1
On	1
foot,	1
alone,	1
undaunted,	1
high-souled,	1
with	1
but	1
a	1
simple	1
sword,	1
and	1
that	1
no	1
trenchant	1
blade	1
of	1
the	1
Perrillo	1
brand,	1
a	1
shield,	1
but	1
no	1
bright	1
polished	1
steel	1
one,	1
there	1
stoodst	1
thou,	1
biding	1
and	1
awaiting	1
the	1
two	1
fiercest	1
lions	1
that	1
Africa’s	1
forests	1
ever	1
bred!	1
Thy	1
own	1
deeds	1
be	1
thy	1
praise,	1
valiant	1
Manchegan,	1
and	1
here	1
I	1
leave	1
them	1
as	1
they	1
stand,	1
wanting	1
the	1
words	1
wherewith	1
to	1
glorify	1
them!”	1

Here	1
the	1
author’s	1
outburst	1
came	1
to	1
an	1
end,	1
and	1
he	1
proceeded	1
to	1
take	1
up	1
the	1
thread	1
of	1
his	1
story,	1
saying	1
that	1
the	1
keeper,	1
seeing	1
that	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
had	1
taken	1
up	1
his	1
position,	1
and	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
impossible	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
avoid	1
letting	1
out	1
the	1
male	1
without	1
incurring	1
the	1
enmity	1
of	1
the	1
fiery	1
and	1
daring	1
knight,	1
flung	1
open	1
the	1
doors	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
cage,	1
containing,	1
as	1
has	1
been	1
said,	1
the	1
lion,	1
which	1
was	1
now	1
seen	1
to	1
be	1
of	1
enormous	1
size,	1
and	1
grim	1
and	1
hideous	1
mien.	1
The	1
first	1
thing	1
he	1
did	1
was	1
to	1
turn	1
round	1
in	1
the	1
cage	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
lay,	1
and	1
protrude	1
his	1
claws,	1
and	1
stretch	1
himself	1
thoroughly;	1
he	1
next	1
opened	1
his	1
mouth,	1
and	1
yawned	1
very	1
leisurely,	1
and	1
with	1
near	1
two	1
palms’	1
length	1
of	1
tongue	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
thrust	1
forth,	1
he	1
licked	1
the	1
dust	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
eyes	1
and	1
washed	1
his	1
face;	1
having	1
done	1
this,	1
he	1
put	1
his	1
head	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
cage	1
and	1
looked	1
all	1
round	1
with	1
eyes	1
like	1
glowing	1
coals,	1
a	1
spectacle	1
and	1
demeanour	1
to	1
strike	1
terror	1
into	1
temerity	1
itself.	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
merely	1
observed	1
him	1
steadily,	1
longing	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
leap	1
from	1
the	1
cart	1
and	1
come	1
to	1
close	1
quarters	1
with	1
him,	1
when	1
he	1
hoped	1
to	1
hew	1
him	1
in	1
pieces.	1
So	1
far	1
did	1
his	1
unparalleled	1
madness	1
go;	1
but	1
the	1
noble	1
lion,	1
more	1
courteous	1
than	1
arrogant,	1
not	1
troubling	1
himself	1
about	1
silly	1
bravado,	1
after	1
having	1
looked	1
all	1
round,	1
as	1
has	1
been	1
said,	1
turned	1
about	1
and	1
presented	1
his	1
hind-quarters	1
to	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
and	1
very	1
coolly	1
and	1
tranquilly	1
lay	1
down	1
again	1
in	1
the	1
cage.	1
Seeing	1
this,	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
ordered	1
the	1
keeper	1
to	1
take	1
a	1
stick	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
provoke	1
him	1
to	1
make	1
him	1
come	1
out.	1
“That	1
I	1
won’t,”	1
said	1
the	1
keeper;	1
“for	1
if	1
I	1
anger	1
him,	1
the	1
first	1
he’ll	1
tear	1
in	1
pieces	1
will	1
be	1
myself.	1
Be	1
satisfied,	1
sir	1
knight,	1
with	1
what	1
you	1
have	1
done,	1
which	1
leaves	1
nothing	1
more	1
to	1
be	1
said	1
on	1
the	1
score	1
of	1
courage,	1
and	1
do	1
not	1
seek	1
to	1
tempt	1
fortune	1
a	1
second	1
time.	1
The	1
lion	1
has	1
the	1
door	1
open;	1
he	1
is	1
free	1
to	1
come	1
out	1
or	1
not	1
to	1
come	1
out;	1
but	1
as	1
he	1
has	1
not	1
come	1
out	1
so	1
far,	1
he	1
will	1
not	1
come	1
out	1
to-day.	1
Your	1
worship’s	1
great	1
courage	1
has	1
been	1
fully	1
manifested	1
already;	1
no	1
brave	1
champion,	1
so	1
it	1
strikes	1
me,	1
is	1
bound	1
to	1
do	1
more	1
than	1
challenge	1
his	1
enemy	1
and	1
wait	1
for	1
him	1
on	1
the	1
field;	1
if	1
his	1
adversary	1
does	1
not	1
come,	1
on	1
him	1
lies	1
the	1
disgrace,	1
and	1
he	1
who	1
waits	1
for	1
him	1
carries	1
off	1
the	1
crown	1
of	1
victory.”	1
“That	1
is	1
true,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
“close	1
the	1
door,	1
my	1
friend,	1
and	1
let	1
me	1
have,	1
in	1
the	1
best	1
form	1
thou	1
canst,	1
what	1
thou	1
hast	1
seen	1
me	1
do,	1
by	1
way	1
of	1
certificate;	1
to	1
wit,	1
that	1
thou	1
didst	1
open	1
for	1
the	1
lion,	1
that	1
I	1
waited	1
for	1
him,	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
come	1
out,	1
that	1
I	1
still	1
waited	1
for	1
him,	1
and	1
that	1
still	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
come	1
out,	1
and	1
lay	1
down	1
again.	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
bound	1
to	1
do	1
more;	1
enchantments	1
avaunt,	1
and	1
God	1
uphold	1
the	1
right,	1
the	1
truth,	1
and	1
true	1
chivalry!	1
Close	1
the	1
door	1
as	1
I	1
bade	1
thee,	1
while	1
I	1
make	1
signals	1
to	1
the	1
fugitives	1
that	1
have	1
left	1
us,	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
learn	1
this	1
exploit	1
from	1
thy	1
lips.”	1
The	1
keeper	1
obeyed,	1
and	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
fixing	1
on	1
the	1
point	1
of	1
his	1
lance	1
the	1
cloth	1
he	1
had	1
wiped	1
his	1
face	1
with	1
after	1
the	1
deluge	1
of	1
curds,	1
proceeded	1
to	1
recall	1
the	1
others,	1
who	1
still	1
continued	1
to	1
fly,	1
looking	1
back	1
at	1
every	1
step,	1
all	1
in	1
a	1
body,	1
the	1
gentleman	1
bringing	1
up	1
the	1
rear.	1
Sancho,	1
however,	1
happening	1
to	1
observe	1
the	1
signal	1
of	1
the	1
white	1
cloth,	1
exclaimed,	1
“May	1
I	1
die,	1
if	1
my	1
master	1
has	1
not	1
overcome	1
the	1
wild	1
beasts,	1
for	1
he	1
is	1
calling	1
to	1
us.”	1
They	1
all	1
stopped,	1
and	1
perceived	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
who	1
was	1
making	1
signals,	1
and	1
shaking	1
off	1
their	1
fears	1
to	1
some	1
extent,	1
they	1
approached	1
slowly	1
until	1
they	1
were	1
near	1
enough	1
to	1
hear	1
distinctly	1
Don	1
Quixote’s	1
voice	1
calling	1
to	1
them.	1
They	1
returned	1
at	1
length	1
to	1
the	1
cart,	1
and	1
as	1
they	1
came	1
up,	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
carter,	1
“Put	1
your	1
mules	1
to	1
once	1
more,	1
brother,	1
and	1
continue	1
your	1
journey;	1
and	1
do	1
thou,	1
Sancho,	1
give	1
him	1
two	1
gold	1
crowns	1
for	1
himself	1
and	1
the	1
keeper,	1
to	1
compensate	1
for	1
the	1
delay	1
they	1
have	1
incurred	1
through	1
me.”	1
“That	1
will	1
I	1
give	1
with	1
all	1
my	1
heart,”	1
said	1
Sancho;	1
“but	1
what	1
has	1
become	1
of	1
the	1
lions?	1
Are	1
they	1
dead	1
or	1
alive?”	1
The	1
keeper,	1
then,	1
in	1
full	1
detail,	1
and	1
bit	1
by	1
bit,	1
described	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
contest,	1
exalting	1
to	1
the	1
best	1
of	1
his	1
power	1
and	1
ability	1
the	1
valour	1
of	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
at	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
whom	1
the	1
lion	1
quailed,	1
and	1
would	1
not	1
and	1
dared	1
not	1
come	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
cage,	1
although	1
he	1
had	1
held	1
the	1
door	1
open	1
ever	1
so	1
long;	1
and	1
showing	1
how,	1
in	1
consequence	1
of	1
his	1
having	1
represented	1
to	1
the	1
knight	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
tempting	1
God	1
to	1
provoke	1
the	1
lion	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
force	1
him	1
out,	1
which	1
he	1
wished	1
to	1
have	1
done,	1
he	1
very	1
reluctantly,	1
and	1
altogether	1
against	1
his	1
will,	1
had	1
allowed	1
the	1
door	1
to	1
be	1
closed.	1
“What	1
dost	1
thou	1
think	1
of	1
this,	1
Sancho?”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote.	1
“Are	1
there	1
any	1
enchantments	1
that	1
can	1
prevail	1
against	1
true	1
valour?	1
The	1
enchanters	1
may	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
rob	1
me	1
of	1
good	1
fortune,	1
but	1
of	1
fortitude	1
and	1
courage	1
they	1
cannot.”	1
Sancho	1
paid	1
the	1
crowns,	1
the	1
carter	1
put	1
to,	1
the	1
keeper	1
kissed	1
Don	1
Quixote’s	1
hands	1
for	1
the	1
bounty	1
bestowed	1
upon	1
him,	1
and	1
promised	1
to	1
give	1
an	1
account	1
of	1
the	1
valiant	1
exploit	1
to	1
the	1
King	1
himself,	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
saw	1
him	1
at	1
court.	1
“Then,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“if	1
his	1
Majesty	1
should	1
happen	1
to	1
ask	1
who	1
performed	1
it,	1
you	1
must	1
say	1
THE	1
KNIGHT	1
OF	1
THE	1
LIONS;	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
my	1
desire	1
that	1
into	1
this	1
the	1
name	1
I	1
have	1
hitherto	1
borne	1
of	1
Knight	1
of	1
the	1
Rueful	1
Countenance	1
be	1
from	1
this	1
time	1
forward	1
changed,	1
altered,	1
transformed,	1
and	1
turned;	1
and	1
in	1
this	1
I	1
follow	1
the	1
ancient	1
usage	1
of	1
knights-errant,	1
who	1
changed	1
their	1
names	1
when	1
they	1
pleased,	1
or	1
when	1
it	1
suited	1
their	1
purpose.”	1
The	1
cart	1
went	1
its	1
way,	1
and	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
Sancho,	1
and	1
he	1
of	1
the	1
green	1
gaban	1
went	1
theirs.	1
All	1
this	1
time,	1
Don	1
Diego	1
de	1
Miranda	1
had	1
not	1
spoken	1
a	1
word,	1
being	1
entirely	1
taken	1
up	1
with	1
observing	1
and	1
noting	1
all	1
that	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
did	1
and	1
said,	1
and	1
the	1
opinion	1
he	1
formed	1
was	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
brains	1
gone	1
mad,	1
and	1
a	1
madman	1
on	1
the	1
verge	1
of	1
rationality.	1
The	1
first	1
part	1
of	1
his	1
history	1
had	1
not	1
yet	1
reached	1
him,	1
for,	1
had	1
he	1
read	1
it,	1
the	1
amazement	1
with	1
which	1
his	1
words	1
and	1
deeds	1
filled	1
him	1
would	1
have	1
vanished,	1
as	1
he	1
would	1
then	1
have	1
understood	1
the	1
nature	1
of	1
his	1
madness;	1
but	1
knowing	1
nothing	1
of	1
it,	1
he	1
took	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
rational	1
one	1
moment,	1
and	1
crazy	1
the	1
next,	1
for	1
what	1
he	1
said	1
was	1
sensible,	1
elegant,	1
and	1
well	1
expressed,	1
and	1
what	1
he	1
did,	1
absurd,	1
rash,	1
and	1
foolish;	1
and	1
said	1
he	1
to	1
himself,	1
“What	1
could	1
be	1
madder	1
than	1
putting	1
on	1
a	1
helmet	1
full	1
of	1
curds,	1
and	1
then	1
persuading	1
oneself	1
that	1
enchanters	1
are	1
softening	1
one’s	1
skull;	1
or	1
what	1
could	1
be	1
greater	1
rashness	1
and	1
folly	1
than	1
wanting	1
to	1
fight	1
lions	1
tooth	1
and	1
nail?”	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
roused	1
him	1
from	1
these	1
reflections	1
and	1
this	1
soliloquy	1
by	1
saying,	1
“No	1
doubt,	1
Señor	1
Don	1
Diego	1
de	1
Miranda,	1
you	1
set	1
me	1
down	1
in	1
your	1
mind	1
as	1
a	1
fool	1
and	1
a	1
madman,	1
and	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
no	1
wonder	1
if	1
you	1
did,	1
for	1
my	1
deeds	1
do	1
not	1
argue	1
anything	1
else.	1
But	1
for	1
all	1
that,	1
I	1
would	1
have	1
you	1
take	1
notice	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
neither	1
so	1
mad	1
nor	1
so	1
foolish	1
as	1
I	1
must	1
have	1
seemed	1
to	1
you.	1
A	1
gallant	1
knight	1
shows	1
to	1
advantage	1
bringing	1
his	1
lance	1
to	1
bear	1
adroitly	1
upon	1
a	1
fierce	1
bull	1
under	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
his	1
sovereign,	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
a	1
spacious	1
plaza;	1
a	1
knight	1
shows	1
to	1
advantage	1
arrayed	1
in	1
glittering	1
armour,	1
pacing	1
the	1
lists	1
before	1
the	1
ladies	1
in	1
some	1
joyous	1
tournament,	1
and	1
all	1
those	1
knights	1
show	1
to	1
advantage	1
that	1
entertain,	1
divert,	1
and,	1
if	1
we	1
may	1
say	1
so,	1
honour	1
the	1
courts	1
of	1
their	1
princes	1
by	1
warlike	1
exercises,	1
or	1
what	1
resemble	1
them;	1
but	1
to	1
greater	1
advantage	1
than	1
all	1
these	1
does	1
a	1
knight-errant	1
show	1
when	1
he	1
traverses	1
deserts,	1
solitudes,	1
cross-roads,	1
forests,	1
and	1
mountains,	1
in	1
quest	1
of	1
perilous	1
adventures,	1
bent	1
on	1
bringing	1
them	1
to	1
a	1
happy	1
and	1
successful	1
issue,	1
all	1
to	1
win	1
a	1
glorious	1
and	1
lasting	1
renown.	1
To	1
greater	1
advantage,	1
I	1
maintain,	1
does	1
the	1
knight-errant	1
show	1
bringing	1
aid	1
to	1
some	1
widow	1
in	1
some	1
lonely	1
waste,	1
than	1
the	1
court	1
knight	1
dallying	1
with	1
some	1
city	1
damsel.	1
All	1
knights	1
have	1
their	1
own	1
special	1
parts	1
to	1
play;	1
let	1
the	1
courtier	1
devote	1
himself	1
to	1
the	1
ladies,	1
let	1
him	1
add	1
lustre	1
to	1
his	1
sovereign’s	1
court	1
by	1
his	1
liveries,	1
let	1
him	1
entertain	1
poor	1
gentlemen	1
with	1
the	1
sumptuous	1
fare	1
of	1
his	1
table,	1
let	1
him	1
arrange	1
joustings,	1
marshal	1
tournaments,	1
and	1
prove	1
himself	1
noble,	1
generous,	1
and	1
magnificent,	1
and	1
above	1
all	1
a	1
good	1
Christian,	1
and	1
so	1
doing	1
he	1
will	1
fulfil	1
the	1
duties	1
that	1
are	1
especially	1
his;	1
but	1
let	1
the	1
knight-errant	1
explore	1
the	1
corners	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
and	1
penetrate	1
the	1
most	1
intricate	1
labyrinths,	1
at	1
each	1
step	1
let	1
him	1
attempt	1
impossibilities,	1
on	1
desolate	1
heaths	1
let	1
him	1
endure	1
the	1
burning	1
rays	1
of	1
the	1
midsummer	1
sun,	1
and	1
the	1
bitter	1
inclemency	1
of	1
the	1
winter	1
winds	1
and	1
frosts;	1
let	1
no	1
lions	1
daunt	1
him,	1
no	1
monsters	1
terrify	1
him,	1
no	1
dragons	1
make	1
him	1
quail;	1
for	1
to	1
seek	1
these,	1
to	1
attack	1
those,	1
and	1
to	1
vanquish	1
all,	1
are	1
in	1
truth	1
his	1
main	1
duties.	1
I,	1
then,	1
as	1
it	1
has	1
fallen	1
to	1
my	1
lot	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
member	1
of	1
knight-errantry,	1
cannot	1
avoid	1
attempting	1
all	1
that	1
to	1
me	1
seems	1
to	1
come	1
within	1
the	1
sphere	1
of	1
my	1
duties;	1
thus	1
it	1
was	1
my	1
bounden	1
duty	1
to	1
attack	1
those	1
lions	1
that	1
I	1
just	1
now	1
attacked,	1
although	1
I	1
knew	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
height	1
of	1
rashness;	1
for	1
I	1
know	1
well	1
what	1
valour	1
is,	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
virtue	1
that	1
occupies	1
a	1
place	1
between	1
two	1
vicious	1
extremes,	1
cowardice	1
and	1
temerity;	1
but	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
a	1
lesser	1
evil	1
for	1
him	1
who	1
is	1
valiant	1
to	1
rise	1
till	1
he	1
reaches	1
the	1
point	1
of	1
rashness,	1
than	1
to	1
sink	1
until	1
he	1
reaches	1
the	1
point	1
of	1
cowardice;	1
for,	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
easier	1
for	1
the	1
prodigal	1
than	1
for	1
the	1
miser	1
to	1
become	1
generous,	1
so	1
it	1
is	1
easier	1
for	1
a	1
rash	1
man	1
to	1
prove	1
truly	1
valiant	1
than	1
for	1
a	1
coward	1
to	1
rise	1
to	1
true	1
valour;	1
and	1
believe	1
me,	1
Señor	1
Don	1
Diego,	1
in	1
attempting	1
adventures	1
it	1
is	1
better	1
to	1
lose	1
by	1
a	1
card	1
too	1
many	1
than	1
by	1
a	1
card	1
too	1
few;	1
for	1
to	1
hear	1
it	1
said,	1
‘such	1
a	1
knight	1
is	1
rash	1
and	1
daring,’	1
sounds	1
better	1
than	1
‘such	1
a	1
knight	1
is	1
timid	1
and	1
cowardly.’”	1
“I	1
protest,	1
Señor	1
Don	1
Quixote,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Diego,	1
“everything	1
you	1
have	1
said	1
and	1
done	1
is	1
proved	1
correct	1
by	1
the	1
test	1
of	1
reason	1
itself;	1
and	1
I	1
believe,	1
if	1
the	1
laws	1
and	1
ordinances	1
of	1
knight-errantry	1
should	1
be	1
lost,	1
they	1
might	1
be	1
found	1
in	1
your	1
worship’s	1
breast	1
as	1
in	1
their	1
own	1
proper	1
depository	1
and	1
muniment-house;	1
but	1
let	1
us	1
make	1
haste,	1
and	1
reach	1
my	1
village,	1
where	1
you	1
shall	1
take	1
rest	1
after	1
your	1
late	1
exertions;	1
for	1
if	1
they	1
have	1
not	1
been	1
of	1
the	1
body	1
they	1
have	1
been	1
of	1
the	1
spirit,	1
and	1
these	1
sometimes	1
tend	1
to	1
produce	1
bodily	1
fatigue.”	1
“I	1
take	1
the	1
invitation	1
as	1
a	1
great	1
favour	1
and	1
honour,	1
Señor	1
Don	1
Diego,”	1
replied	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
and	1
pressing	1
forward	1
at	1
a	1
better	1
pace	1
than	1
before,	1
at	1
about	1
two	1
in	1
the	1
afternoon	1
they	1
reached	1
the	1
village	1
and	1
house	1
of	1
Don	1
Diego,	1

as	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
called	1
him,	1

Gaban.”	1

The	1
student	1
poet,	1
Don	1
Diego’s	1
son,	1
who	1
had	1
come	1
out	1
with	1
his	1
mother	1
to	1
receive	1
him,	1
heard	1
this	1
exclamation,	1
and	1
both	1
mother	1
and	1
son	1
were	1
filled	1
with	1
amazement	1
at	1
the	1
extraordinary	1
figure	1
he	1
presented;	1
he,	1
however,	1
dismounting	1
from	1
Rocinante,	1
advanced	1
with	1
great	1
politeness	1
to	1
ask	1
permission	1
to	1
kiss	1
the	1
lady’s	1
hand,	1
while	1
Don	1
Diego	1
said,	1
“Señora,	1
pray	1
receive	1
with	1
your	1
wonted	1
kindness	1
Señor	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
of	1
La	1
Mancha,	1
whom	1
you	1
see	1
before	1
you,	1
a	1
knight-errant,	1
and	1
the	1
bravest	1
and	1
wisest	1
in	1
the	1
world.”	1
The	1
lady,	1
whose	1
name	1
was	1
Doña	1
Christina,	1
received	1
him	1
with	1
every	1
sign	1
of	1
good-will	1
and	1
great	1
courtesy,	1
and	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
placed	1
himself	1
at	1
her	1
service	1
with	1
an	1
abundance	1
of	1
well-chosen	1
and	1
polished	1
phrases.	1
Almost	1
the	1
same	1
civilities	1
were	1
exchanged	1
between	1
him	1
and	1
the	1
student,	1
who	1
listening	1
to	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
took	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
sensible,	1
clear-headed	1
person.	1
Here	1
the	1
author	1
describes	1
minutely	1
everything	1
belonging	1
to	1
Don	1
Diego’s	1
mansion,	1
putting	1
before	1
us	1
in	1
his	1
picture	1
the	1
whole	1
contents	1
of	1
a	1
rich	1
gentleman-farmer’s	1
house;	1
but	1
the	1
translator	1
of	1
the	1
history	1
thought	1
it	1
best	1
to	1
pass	1
over	1
these	1
and	1
other	1
details	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
sort	1
in	1
silence,	1
as	1
they	1
are	1
not	1
in	1
harmony	1
with	1
the	1
main	1
purpose	1
of	1
the	1
story,	1
the	1
strong	1
point	1
of	1
which	1
is	1
truth	1
rather	1
than	1
dull	1
digressions.	1
They	1
led	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
into	1
a	1
room,	1
and	1
Sancho	1
removed	1
his	1
armour,	1
leaving	1
him	1
in	1
loose	1
Walloon	1
breeches	1
and	1
chamois-leather	1
doublet,	1
all	1
stained	1
with	1
the	1
rust	1
of	1
his	1
armour;	1
his	1
collar	1
was	1
a	1
falling	1
one	1
of	1
scholastic	1
cut,	1
without	1
starch	1
or	1
lace,	1
his	1
buskins	1
buff-coloured,	1
and	1
his	1
shoes	1
polished.	1
He	1
wore	1
his	1
good	1
sword,	1
which	1
hung	1
in	1
a	1
baldric	1
of	1
sea-wolf’s	1
skin,	1
for	1
he	1
had	1
suffered	1
for	1
many	1
years,	1
they	1
say,	1
from	1
an	1
ailment	1
of	1
the	1
kidneys;	1
and	1
over	1
all	1
he	1
threw	1
a	1
long	1
cloak	1
of	1
good	1
grey	1
cloth.	1
But	1
first	1
of	1
all,	1
with	1
five	1
or	1
six	1
buckets	1
of	1
water	1
(for	1
as	1
regard	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
buckets	1
there	1
is	1
some	1
dispute),	1
he	1
washed	1
his	1
head	1
and	1
face,	1
and	1
still	1
the	1
water	1
remained	1
whey-coloured,	1
thanks	1
to	1
Sancho’s	1
greediness	1
and	1
purchase	1
of	1
those	1
unlucky	1
curds	1
that	1
turned	1
his	1
master	1
so	1
white.	1
Thus	1
arrayed,	1
and	1
with	1
an	1
easy,	1
sprightly,	1
and	1
gallant	1
air,	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
passed	1
out	1
into	1
another	1
room,	1
where	1
the	1
student	1
was	1
waiting	1
to	1
entertain	1
him	1
while	1
the	1
table	1
was	1
being	1
laid;	1
for	1
on	1
the	1
arrival	1
of	1
so	1
distinguished	1
a	1
guest,	1
Doña	1
Christina	1
was	1
anxious	1
to	1
show	1
that	1
she	1
knew	1
how	1
and	1
was	1
able	1
to	1
give	1
a	1
becoming	1
reception	1
to	1
those	1
who	1
came	1
to	1
her	1
house.	1
While	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
was	1
taking	1
off	1
his	1
armour,	1
Don	1
Lorenzo	1
(for	1
so	1
Don	1
Diego’s	1
son	1
was	1
called)	1
took	1
the	1
opportunity	1
to	1
say	1
to	1
his	1
father,	1
“What	1
are	1
we	1
to	1
make	1
of	1
this	1
gentleman	1
you	1
have	1
brought	1
home	1
to	1
us,	1
sir?	1
For	1
his	1
name,	1
his	1
appearance,	1
and	1
your	1
describing	1
him	1
as	1
a	1
knight-errant	1
have	1
completely	1
puzzled	1
my	1
mother	1
and	1
me.”	1
“I	1
don’t	1
know	1
what	1
to	1
say,	1
my	1
son,”	1
replied.	1
Don	1
Diego;	1
“all	1
I	1
can	1
tell	1
thee	1
is	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
seen	1
him	1
act	1
the	1
acts	1
of	1
the	1
greatest	1
madman	1
in	1
the	1
world,	1
and	1
heard	1
him	1
make	1
observations	1
so	1
sensible	1
that	1
they	1
efface	1
and	1
undo	1
all	1
he	1
does;	1
do	1
thou	1
talk	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
feel	1
the	1
pulse	1
of	1
his	1
wits,	1
and	1
as	1
thou	1
art	1
shrewd,	1
form	1
the	1
most	1
reasonable	1
conclusion	1
thou	1
canst	1
as	1
to	1
his	1
wisdom	1
or	1
folly;	1
though,	1
to	1
tell	1
the	1
truth,	1
I	1
am	1
more	1
inclined	1
to	1
take	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
mad	1
than	1
sane.”	1
With	1
this	1
Don	1
Lorenzo	1
went	1
away	1
to	1
entertain	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
as	1
has	1
been	1
said,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
the	1
conversation	1
that	1
passed	1
between	1
them	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
said	1
to	1
Don	1
Lorenzo,	1
“Your	1
father,	1
Señor	1
Don	1
Diego	1
de	1
Miranda,	1
has	1
told	1
me	1
of	1
the	1
rare	1
abilities	1
and	1
subtle	1
intellect	1
you	1
possess,	1
and,	1
above	1
all,	1
that	1
you	1
are	1
a	1
great	1
poet.”	1
“A	1
poet,	1
it	1
may	1
be,”	1
replied	1
Don	1
Lorenzo,	1
“but	1
a	1
great	1
one,	1
by	1
no	1
means.	1
It	1
is	1
true	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
somewhat	1
given	1
to	1
poetry	1
and	1
to	1
reading	1
good	1
poets,	1
but	1
not	1
so	1
much	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
justify	1
the	1
title	1
of	1
‘great’	1
which	1
my	1
father	1
gives	1
me.”	1
“I	1
do	1
not	1
dislike	1
that	1
modesty,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
“for	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
poet	1
who	1
is	1
not	1
conceited	1
and	1
does	1
not	1
think	1
he	1
is	1
the	1
best	1
poet	1
in	1
the	1
world.”	1
“There	1
is	1
no	1
rule	1
without	1
an	1
exception,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Lorenzo;	1
“there	1
may	1
be	1
some	1
who	1
are	1
poets	1
and	1
yet	1
do	1
not	1
think	1
they	1
are.”	1
“Very	1
few,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
“but	1
tell	1
me,	1
what	1
verses	1
are	1
those	1
which	1
you	1
have	1
now	1
in	1
hand,	1
and	1
which	1
your	1
father	1
tells	1
me	1
keep	1
you	1
somewhat	1
restless	1
and	1
absorbed?	1
If	1
it	1
be	1
some	1
gloss,	1
I	1
know	1
something	1
about	1
glosses,	1
and	1
I	1
should	1
like	1
to	1
hear	1
them;	1
and	1
if	1
they	1
are	1
for	1
a	1
poetical	1
tournament,	1
contrive	1
to	1
carry	1
off	1
the	1
second	1
prize;	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
always	1
goes	1
by	1
favour	1
or	1
personal	1
standing,	1
the	1
second	1
by	1
simple	1
justice;	1
and	1
so	1
the	1
third	1
comes	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
second,	1
and	1
the	1
first,	1
reckoning	1
in	1
this	1
way,	1
will	1
be	1
third,	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
way	1
as	1
licentiate	1
degrees	1
are	1
conferred	1
at	1
the	1
universities;	1
but,	1
for	1
all	1
that,	1
the	1
title	1
of	1
first	1
is	1
a	1
great	1
distinction.”	1
“So	1
far,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Lorenzo	1
to	1
himself,	1
“I	1
should	1
not	1
take	1
you	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
madman;	1
but	1
let	1
us	1
go	1
on.”	1
So	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
him,	1
“Your	1
worship	1
has	1
apparently	1
attended	1
the	1
schools;	1
what	1
sciences	1
have	1
you	1
studied?”	1
“That	1
of	1
knight-errantry,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“which	1
is	1
as	1
good	1
as	1
that	1
of	1
poetry,	1
and	1
even	1
a	1
finger	1
or	1
two	1
above	1
it.”	1
“I	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
what	1
science	1
that	1
is,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Lorenzo,	1
“and	1
until	1
now	1
I	1
have	1
never	1
heard	1
of	1
it.”	1
“It	1
is	1
a	1
science,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“that	1
comprehends	1
in	1
itself	1
all	1
or	1
most	1
of	1
the	1
sciences	1
in	1
the	1
world,	1
for	1
he	1
who	1
professes	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
a	1
jurist,	1
and	1
must	1
know	1
the	1
rules	1
of	1
justice,	1
distributive	1
and	1
equitable,	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
give	1
to	1
each	1
one	1
what	1
belongs	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
is	1
due	1
to	1
him.	1
He	1
must	1
be	1
a	1
theologian,	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
give	1
a	1
clear	1
and	1
distinctive	1
reason	1
for	1
the	1
Christian	1
faith	1
he	1
professes,	1
wherever	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
asked	1
of	1
him.	1
He	1
must	1
be	1
a	1
physician,	1
and	1
above	1
all	1
a	1
herbalist,	1
so	1
as	1
in	1
wastes	1
and	1
solitudes	1
to	1
know	1
the	1
herbs	1
that	1
have	1
the	1
property	1
of	1
healing	1
wounds,	1
for	1
a	1
knight-errant	1
must	1
not	1
go	1
looking	1
for	1
someone	1
to	1
cure	1
him	1
at	1
every	1
step.	1
He	1
must	1
be	1
an	1
astronomer,	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
know	1
by	1
the	1
stars	1
how	1
many	1
hours	1
of	1
the	1
night	1
have	1
passed,	1
and	1
what	1
clime	1
and	1
quarter	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
he	1
is	1
in.	1
He	1
must	1
know	1
mathematics,	1
for	1
at	1
every	1
turn	1
some	1
occasion	1
for	1
them	1
will	1
present	1
itself	1
to	1
him;	1
and,	1
putting	1
it	1
aside	1
that	1
he	1
must	1
be	1
adorned	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
virtues,	1
cardinal	1
and	1
theological,	1
to	1
come	1
down	1
to	1
minor	1
particulars,	1
he	1
must,	1
I	1
say,	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
swim	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
Nicholas	1
or	1
Nicolao	1
the	1
Fish	1
could,	1
as	1
the	1
story	1
goes;	1
he	1
must	1
know	1
how	1
to	1
shoe	1
a	1
horse,	1
and	1
repair	1
his	1
saddle	1
and	1
bridle;	1
and,	1
to	1
return	1
to	1
higher	1
matters,	1
he	1
must	1
be	1
faithful	1
to	1
God	1
and	1
to	1
his	1
lady;	1
he	1
must	1
be	1
pure	1
in	1
thought,	1
decorous	1
in	1
words,	1
generous	1
in	1
works,	1
valiant	1
in	1
deeds,	1
patient	1
in	1
suffering,	1
compassionate	1
towards	1
the	1
needy,	1
and,	1
lastly,	1
an	1
upholder	1
of	1
the	1
truth	1
though	1
its	1
defence	1
should	1
cost	1
him	1
his	1
life.	1
Of	1
all	1
these	1
qualities,	1
great	1
and	1
small,	1
is	1
a	1
true	1
knight-errant	1
made	1
up;	1
judge	1
then,	1
Señor	1
Don	1
Lorenzo,	1
whether	1
it	1
be	1
a	1
contemptible	1
science	1
which	1
the	1
knight	1
who	1
studies	1
and	1
professes	1
it	1
has	1
to	1
learn,	1
and	1
whether	1
it	1
may	1
not	1
compare	1
with	1
the	1
very	1
loftiest	1
that	1
are	1
taught	1
in	1
the	1
schools.”	1
“If	1
that	1
be	1
so,”	1
replied	1
Don	1
Lorenzo,	1
“this	1
science,	1
I	1
protest,	1
surpasses	1
all.”	1
“How,	1
if	1
that	1
be	1
so?”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote.	1
“What	1
I	1
mean	1
to	1
say,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Lorenzo,	1
“is,	1
that	1
I	1
doubt	1
whether	1
there	1
are	1
now,	1
or	1
ever	1
were,	1
any	1
knights-errant,	1
and	1
adorned	1
with	1
such	1
virtues.”	1
“Many	1
a	1
time,”	1
replied	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“have	1
I	1
said	1
what	1
I	1
now	1
say	1
once	1
more,	1
that	1
the	1
majority	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
are	1
of	1
opinion	1
that	1
there	1
never	1
were	1
any	1
knights-errant	1
in	1
it;	1
and	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
my	1
opinion	1
that,	1
unless	1
heaven	1
by	1
some	1
miracle	1
brings	1
home	1
to	1
them	1
the	1
truth	1
that	1
there	1
were	1
and	1
are,	1
all	1
the	1
pains	1
one	1
takes	1
will	1
be	1
in	1
vain	1
(as	1
experience	1
has	1
often	1
proved	1
to	1
me),	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
now	1
stop	1
to	1
disabuse	1
you	1
of	1
the	1
error	1
you	1
share	1
with	1
the	1
multitude.	1
All	1
I	1
shall	1
do	1
is	1
to	1
pray	1
to	1
heaven	1
to	1
deliver	1
you	1
from	1
it,	1
and	1
show	1
you	1
how	1
beneficial	1
and	1
necessary	1
knights-errant	1
were	1
in	1
days	1
of	1
yore,	1
and	1
how	1
useful	1
they	1
would	1
be	1
in	1
these	1
days	1
were	1
they	1
but	1
in	1
vogue;	1
but	1
now,	1
for	1
the	1
sins	1
of	1
the	1
people,	1
sloth	1
and	1
indolence,	1
gluttony	1
and	1
luxury	1
are	1
triumphant.”	1
“Our	1
guest	1
has	1
broken	1
out	1
on	1
our	1
hands,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Lorenzo	1
to	1
himself	1
at	1
this	1
point;	1
“but,	1
for	1
all	1
that,	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
glorious	1
madman,	1
and	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
a	1
dull	1
blockhead	1
to	1
doubt	1
it.”	1
Here,	1
being	1
summoned	1
to	1
dinner,	1
they	1
brought	1
their	1
colloquy	1
to	1
a	1
close.	1
Don	1
Diego	1
asked	1
his	1
son	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
able	1
to	1
make	1
out	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
wits	1
of	1
their	1
guest.	1
To	1
which	1
he	1
replied,	1
“All	1
the	1
doctors	1
and	1
clever	1
scribes	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
will	1
not	1
make	1
sense	1
of	1
the	1
scrawl	1
of	1
his	1
madness;	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
madman	1
full	1
of	1
streaks,	1
full	1
of	1
lucid	1
intervals.”	1
They	1
went	1
in	1
to	1
dinner,	1
and	1
the	1
repast	1
was	1
such	1
as	1
Don	1
Diego	1
said	1
on	1
the	1
road	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
habit	1
of	1
giving	1
to	1
his	1
guests,	1
neat,	1
plentiful,	1
and	1
tasty;	1
but	1
what	1
pleased	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
most	1
was	1
the	1
marvellous	1
silence	1
that	1
reigned	1
throughout	1
the	1
house,	1
for	1
it	1
was	1
like	1
a	1
Carthusian	1
monastery.	1
When	1
the	1
cloth	1
had	1
been	1
removed,	1
grace	1
said	1
and	1
their	1
hands	1
washed,	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
earnestly	1
pressed	1
Don	1
Lorenzo	1
to	1
repeat	1
to	1
him	1
his	1
verses	1
for	1
the	1
poetical	1
tournament,	1
to	1
which	1
he	1
replied,	1
“Not	1
to	1
be	1
like	1
those	1
poets	1
who,	1
when	1
they	1
are	1
asked	1
to	1
recite	1
their	1
verses,	1
refuse,	1
and	1
when	1
they	1
are	1
not	1
asked	1
for	1
them	1
vomit	1
them	1
up,	1
I	1
will	1
repeat	1
my	1
gloss,	1
for	1
which	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
expect	1
any	1
prize,	1
having	1
composed	1
it	1
merely	1
as	1
an	1
exercise	1
of	1
ingenuity.”	1
“A	1
discerning	1
friend	1
of	1
mine,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“was	1
of	1
opinion	1
that	1
no	1
one	1
ought	1
to	1
waste	1
labour	1
in	1
glossing	1
verses;	1
and	1
the	1
reason	1
he	1
gave	1
was	1
that	1
the	1
gloss	1
can	1
never	1
come	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
text,	1
and	1
that	1
often	1
or	1
most	1
frequently	1
it	1
wanders	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
meaning	1
and	1
purpose	1
aimed	1
at	1
in	1
the	1
glossed	1
lines;	1
and	1
besides,	1
that	1
the	1
laws	1
of	1
the	1
gloss	1
were	1
too	1
strict,	1
as	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
allow	1
interrogations,	1
nor	1
‘said	1
he,’	1
nor	1
‘I	1
say,’	1
nor	1
turning	1
verbs	1
into	1
nouns,	1
or	1
altering	1
the	1
construction,	1
not	1
to	1
speak	1
of	1
other	1
restrictions	1
and	1
limitations	1
that	1
fetter	1
gloss-writers,	1
as	1
you	1
no	1
doubt	1
know.”	1
“Verily,	1
Señor	1
Don	1
Quixote,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Lorenzo,	1
“I	1
wish	1
I	1
could	1
catch	1
your	1
worship	1
tripping	1
at	1
a	1
stretch,	1
but	1
I	1
cannot,	1
for	1
you	1
slip	1
through	1
my	1
fingers	1
like	1
an	1
eel.”	1
“I	1
don’t	1
understand	1
what	1
you	1
say,	1
or	1
mean	1
by	1
slipping,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote.	1
“I	1
will	1
explain	1
myself	1
another	1
time,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Lorenzo;	1
“for	1
the	1
present	1
pray	1
attend	1
to	1
the	1
glossed	1
verses	1
and	1
the	1
gloss,	1
which	1
run	1
thus:	1
Could	1
‘was’	1
become	1
an	1
‘is’	1
for	1
me,	1
Then	1
would	1
I	1
ask	1
no	1
more	1
than	1
this;	1
Or	1
could,	1
for	1
me,	1
the	1
time	1
that	1
is	1
Become	1
the	1
time	1
that	1
is	1
to	1
be!—	1
GLOSS	1
Dame	1
Fortune	1
once	1
upon	1
a	1
day	1
To	1
me	1
was	1
bountiful	1
and	1
kind;	1
But	1
all	1
things	1
change;	1
she	1
changed	1
her	1
mind,	1
And	1
what	1
she	1
gave	1
she	1
took	1
away.	1
O	1
Fortune,	1
long	1
I’ve	1
sued	1
to	1
thee;	1
The	1
gifts	1
thou	1
gavest	1
me	1
restore,	1
For,	1
trust	1
me,	1
I	1
would	1
ask	1
no	1
more,	1
Could	1
‘was’	1
become	1
an	1
‘is’	1
for	1
me.	1
No	1
other	1
prize	1
I	1
seek	1
to	1
gain,	1
No	1
triumph,	1
glory,	1
or	1
success,	1
Only	1
the	1
long-lost	1
happiness,	1
The	1
memory	1
whereof	1
is	1
pain.	1
One	1
taste,	1
methinks,	1
of	1
bygone	1
bliss	1
The	1
heart-consuming	1
fire	1
might	1
stay;	1
And,	1
so	1
it	1
come	1
without	1
delay,	1
Then	1
would	1
I	1
ask	1
no	1
more	1
than	1
this.	1
I	1
ask	1
what	1
cannot	1
be,	1
alas!	1
That	1
time	1
should	1
ever	1
be,	1
and	1
then	1
Come	1
back	1
to	1
us,	1
and	1
be	1
again,	1
No	1
power	1
on	1
earth	1
can	1
bring	1
to	1
pass;	1
For	1
fleet	1
of	1
foot	1
is	1
he,	1
I	1
wis,	1
And	1
idly,	1
therefore,	1
do	1
we	1
pray	1
That	1
what	1
for	1
aye	1
hath	1
left	1
us	1
may	1
Become	1
for	1
us	1
the	1
time	1
that	1
is.	1
Perplexed,	1
uncertain,	1
to	1
remain	1
’Twixt	1
hope	1
and	1
fear,	1
is	1
death,	1
not	1
life;	1
’Twere	1
better,	1
sure,	1
to	1
end	1
the	1
strife,	1
And	1
dying,	1
seek	1
release	1
from	1
pain.	1
And	1
yet,	1
thought	1
were	1
the	1
best	1
for	1
me.	1
Anon	1
the	1
thought	1
aside	1
I	1
fling,	1
And	1
to	1
the	1
present	1
fondly	1
cling,	1
And	1
dread	1
the	1
time	1
that	1
is	1
to	1
be.”	1
When	1
Don	1
Lorenzo	1
had	1
finished	1
reciting	1
his	1
gloss,	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
stood	1
up,	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
loud	1
voice,	1
almost	1
a	1
shout,	1
exclaimed	1
as	1
he	1
grasped	1
Don	1
Lorenzo’s	1
right	1
hand	1
in	1
his,	1
“By	1
the	1
highest	1
heavens,	1
noble	1
youth,	1
but	1
you	1
are	1
the	1
best	1
poet	1
on	1
earth,	1
and	1
deserve	1
to	1
be	1
crowned	1
with	1
laurel,	1
not	1
by	1
Cyprus	1
or	1
by	1
Gaeta—as	1
a	1
certain	1
poet,	1
God	1
forgive	1
him,	1
said—but	1
by	1
the	1
Academies	1
of	1
Athens,	1
if	1
they	1
still	1
flourished,	1
and	1
by	1
those	1
that	1
flourish	1
now,	1
Paris,	1
Bologna,	1
Salamanca.	1
Heaven	1
grant	1
that	1
the	1
judges	1
who	1
rob	1
you	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
prize—that	1
Phœbus	1
may	1
pierce	1
them	1
with	1
his	1
arrows,	1
and	1
the	1
Muses	1
never	1
cross	1
the	1
thresholds	1
of	1
their	1
doors.	1
Repeat	1
me	1
some	1
of	1
your	1
long-measure	1
verses,	1
señor,	1
if	1
you	1
will	1
be	1
so	1
good,	1
for	1
I	1
want	1
thoroughly	1
to	1
feel	1
the	1
pulse	1
of	1
your	1
rare	1
genius.”	1
Is	1
there	1
any	1
need	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
Don	1
Lorenzo	1
enjoyed	1
hearing	1
himself	1
praised	1
by	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
albeit	1
he	1
looked	1
upon	1
him	1
as	1
a	1
madman?	1
power	1
of	1
flattery,	1
how	1
far-reaching	1
art	1
thou,	1
and	1
how	1
wide	1
are	1
the	1
bounds	1
of	1
thy	1
pleasant	1
jurisdiction!	1
Don	1
Lorenzo	1
gave	1
a	1
proof	1
of	1
it,	1
for	1
he	1
complied	1
with	1
Don	1
Quixote’s	1
request	1
and	1
entreaty,	1
and	1
repeated	1
to	1
him	1
this	1
sonnet	1
on	1
the	1
fable	1
or	1
story	1
of	1
Pyramus	1
and	1
Thisbe.	1
SONNET	1
The	1
lovely	1
maid,	1
she	1
pierces	1
now	1
the	1
wall;	1
Heart-pierced	1
by	1
her	1
young	1
Pyramus	1
doth	1
lie;	1
And	1
Love	1
spreads	1
wing	1
from	1
Cyprus	1
isle	1
to	1
fly,	1
A	1
chink	1
to	1
view	1
so	1
wondrous	1
great	1
and	1
small.	1
There	1
silence	1
speaketh,	1
for	1
no	1
voice	1
at	1
all	1
Can	1
pass	1
so	1
strait	1
a	1
strait;	1
but	1
love	1
will	1
ply	1
Where	1
to	1
all	1
other	1
power	1
’twere	1
vain	1
to	1
try;	1
For	1
love	1
will	1
find	1
a	1
way	1
whate’er	1
befall.	1
Impatient	1
of	1
delay,	1
with	1
reckless	1
pace	1
The	1
rash	1
maid	1
wins	1
the	1
fatal	1
spot	1
where	1
she	1
Sinks	1
not	1
in	1
lover’s	1
arms	1
but	1
death’s	1
embrace.	1
So	1
runs	1
the	1
strange	1
tale,	1
how	1
the	1
lovers	1
twain	1
One	1
sword,	1
one	1
sepulchre,	1
one	1
memory,	1
Slays,	1
and	1
entombs,	1
and	1
brings	1
to	1
life	1
again.	1
“Blessed	1
be	1
God,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
heard	1
Don	1
Lorenzo’s	1
sonnet,	1
“that	1
among	1
the	1
hosts	1
there	1
are	1
of	1
irritable	1
poets	1
I	1
have	1
found	1
one	1
consummate	1
one,	1
which,	1
señor,	1
the	1
art	1
of	1
this	1
sonnet	1
proves	1
to	1
me	1
that	1
you	1
are!”	1
For	1
four	1
days	1
was	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
most	1
sumptuously	1
entertained	1
in	1
Don	1
Diego’s	1
house,	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
which	1
time	1
he	1
asked	1
his	1
permission	1
to	1
depart,	1
telling	1
him	1
he	1
thanked	1
him	1
for	1
the	1
kindness	1
and	1
hospitality	1
he	1
had	1
received	1
in	1
his	1
house,	1
but	1
that,	1
as	1
it	1
did	1
not	1
become	1
knights-errant	1
to	1
give	1
themselves	1
up	1
for	1
long	1
to	1
idleness	1
and	1
luxury,	1
he	1
was	1
anxious	1
to	1
fulfill	1
the	1
duties	1
of	1
his	1
calling	1
in	1
seeking	1
adventures,	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
informed	1
there	1
was	1
an	1
abundance	1
in	1
that	1
neighbourhood,	1
where	1
he	1
hoped	1
to	1
employ	1
his	1
time	1
until	1
the	1
day	1
came	1
round	1
for	1
the	1
jousts	1
at	1
Saragossa,	1
for	1
that	1
was	1
his	1
proper	1
destination;	1
and	1
that,	1
first	1
of	1
all,	1
he	1
meant	1
to	1
enter	1
the	1
cave	1
of	1
Montesinos,	1
of	1
which	1
so	1
many	1
marvellous	1
things	1
were	1
reported	1
all	1
through	1
the	1
country,	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
to	1
investigate	1
and	1
explore	1
the	1
origin	1
and	1
true	1
source	1
of	1
the	1
seven	1
lakes	1
commonly	1
called	1
the	1
lakes	1
of	1
Ruidera.	1
Don	1
Diego	1
and	1
his	1
son	1
commended	1
his	1
laudable	1
resolution,	1
and	1
bade	1
him	1
furnish	1
himself	1
with	1
all	1
he	1
wanted	1
from	1
their	1
house	1
and	1
belongings,	1
as	1
they	1
would	1
most	1
gladly	1
be	1
of	1
service	1
to	1
him;	1
which,	1
indeed,	1
his	1
personal	1
worth	1
and	1
his	1
honourable	1
profession	1
made	1
incumbent	1
upon	1
them.	1
The	1
day	1
of	1
his	1
departure	1
came	1
at	1
length,	1
as	1
welcome	1
to	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
sad	1
and	1
sorrowful	1
to	1
Sancho	1
Panza,	1
who	1
was	1
very	1
well	1
satisfied	1
with	1
the	1
abundance	1
of	1
Don	1
Diego’s	1
house,	1
and	1
objected	1
to	1
return	1
to	1
the	1
starvation	1
of	1
the	1
woods	1
and	1
wilds	1
and	1
the	1
short-commons	1
of	1
his	1
ill-stocked	1
alforjas;	1
these,	1
however,	1
he	1
filled	1
and	1
packed	1
with	1
what	1
he	1
considered	1
needful.	1
On	1
taking	1
leave,	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
said	1
to	1
Don	1
Lorenzo,	1
“I	1
know	1
not	1
whether	1
I	1
have	1
told	1
you	1
already,	1
but	1
if	1
I	1
have	1
I	1
tell	1
you	1
once	1
more,	1
that	1
if	1
you	1
wish	1
to	1
spare	1
yourself	1
fatigue	1
and	1
toil	1
in	1
reaching	1
the	1
inaccessible	1
summit	1
of	1
the	1
temple	1
of	1
fame,	1
you	1
have	1
nothing	1
to	1
do	1
but	1
to	1
turn	1
aside	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
somewhat	1
narrow	1
path	1
of	1
poetry	1
and	1
take	1
the	1
still	1
narrower	1
one	1
of	1
knight-errantry,	1
wide	1
enough,	1
however,	1
to	1
make	1
you	1
an	1
emperor	1
in	1
the	1
twinkling	1
of	1
an	1
eye.”	1
In	1
this	1
speech	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
wound	1
up	1
the	1
evidence	1
of	1
his	1
madness,	1
but	1
still	1
better	1
in	1
what	1
he	1
added	1
when	1
he	1
said,	1
“God	1
knows,	1
I	1
would	1
gladly	1
take	1
Don	1
Lorenzo	1
with	1
me	1
to	1
teach	1
him	1
how	1
to	1
spare	1
the	1
humble,	1
and	1
trample	1
the	1
proud	1
under	1
foot,	1
virtues	1
that	1
are	1
part	1
and	1
parcel	1
of	1
the	1
profession	1
I	1
belong	1
to;	1
but	1
since	1
his	1
tender	1
age	1
does	1
not	1
allow	1
of	1
it,	1
nor	1
his	1
praiseworthy	1
pursuits	1
permit	1
it,	1
I	1
will	1
simply	1
content	1
myself	1
with	1
impressing	1
it	1
upon	1
your	1
worship	1
that	1
you	1
will	1
become	1
famous	1
as	1
a	1
poet	1
if	1
you	1
are	1
guided	1
by	1
the	1
opinion	1
of	1
others	1
rather	1
than	1
by	1
your	1
own;	1
because	1
no	1
fathers	1
or	1
mothers	1
ever	1
think	1
their	1
own	1
children	1
ill-favoured,	1
and	1
this	1
sort	1
of	1
deception	1
prevails	1
still	1
more	1
strongly	1
in	1
the	1
case	1
of	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
the	1
brain.”	1
Both	1
father	1
and	1
son	1
were	1
amazed	1
afresh	1
at	1
the	1
strange	1
medley	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
talked,	1
at	1
one	1
moment	1
sense,	1
at	1
another	1
nonsense,	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
pertinacity	1
and	1
persistence	1
he	1
displayed	1
in	1
going	1
through	1
thick	1
and	1
thin	1
in	1
quest	1
of	1
his	1
unlucky	1
adventures,	1
which	1
he	1
made	1
the	1
end	1
and	1
aim	1
of	1
his	1
desires.	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
renewal	1
of	1
offers	1
of	1
service	1
and	1
civilities,	1
and	1
then,	1
with	1
the	1
gracious	1
permission	1
of	1
the	1
lady	1
of	1
the	1
castle,	1
they	1
took	1
their	1
departure,	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
on	1
Rocinante,	1
and	1
Sancho	1
on	1
Dapple.	1

Don	1
Quixote	1
had	1
gone	1
but	1
a	1
short	1
distance	1
beyond	1
Don	1
Diego’s	1
village,	1
when	1
he	1
fell	1
in	1
with	1
a	1
couple	1
of	1
either	1
priests	1
or	1
students,	1
and	1
a	1
couple	1
of	1
peasants,	1
mounted	1
on	1
four	1
beasts	1
of	1
the	1
ass	1
kind.	1
One	1
of	1
the	1
students	1
carried,	1
wrapped	1
up	1
in	1
a	1
piece	1
of	1
green	1
buckram	1
by	1
way	1
of	1
a	1
portmanteau,	1
what	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
little	1
linen	1
and	1
a	1
couple	1
of	1
pairs	1
of	1
ribbed	1
stockings;	1
the	1
other	1
carried	1
nothing	1
but	1
a	1
pair	1
of	1
new	1
fencing-foils	1
with	1
buttons.	1
The	1
peasants	1
carried	1
divers	1
articles	1
that	1
showed	1
they	1
were	1
on	1
their	1
way	1
from	1
some	1
large	1
town	1
where	1
they	1
had	1
bought	1
them,	1
and	1
were	1
taking	1
them	1
home	1
to	1
their	1
village;	1
and	1
both	1
students	1
and	1
peasants	1
were	1
struck	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
amazement	1
that	1
everybody	1
felt	1
who	1
saw	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time,	1
and	1
were	1
dying	1
to	1
know	1
who	1
this	1
man,	1
so	1
different	1
from	1
ordinary	1
men,	1
could	1
be.	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
saluted	1
them,	1
and	1
after	1
ascertaining	1
that	1
their	1
road	1
was	1
the	1
same	1
as	1
his,	1
made	1
them	1
an	1
offer	1
of	1
his	1
company,	1
and	1
begged	1
them	1
to	1
slacken	1
their	1
pace,	1
as	1
their	1
young	1
asses	1
travelled	1
faster	1
than	1
his	1
horse;	1
and	1
then,	1
to	1
gratify	1
them,	1
he	1
told	1
them	1
in	1
a	1
few	1
words	1
who	1
he	1
was	1
and	1
the	1
calling	1
and	1
profession	1
he	1
followed,	1
which	1
was	1
that	1
of	1
a	1
knight-errant	1
seeking	1
adventures	1
in	1
all	1
parts	1
of	1
the	1
world.	1
He	1
informed	1
them	1
that	1
his	1
own	1
name	1
was	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
of	1
La	1
Mancha,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
called,	1
by	1
way	1
of	1
surname,	1
the	1
Knight	1
of	1
the	1
Lions.	1
All	1
this	1
was	1
Greek	1
or	1
gibberish	1
to	1
the	1
peasants,	1
but	1
not	1
so	1
to	1
the	1
students,	1
who	1
very	1
soon	1
perceived	1
the	1
crack	1
in	1
Don	1
Quixote’s	1
pate;	1
for	1
all	1
that,	1
however,	1
they	1
regarded	1
him	1
with	1
admiration	1
and	1
respect,	1
and	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
said	1
to	1
him,	1
“If	1
you,	1
sir	1
knight,	1
have	1
no	1
fixed	1
road,	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
way	1
with	1
those	1
who	1
seek	1
adventures	1
not	1
to	1
have	1
any,	1
let	1
your	1
worship	1
come	1
with	1
us;	1
you	1
will	1
see	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
finest	1
and	1
richest	1
weddings	1
that	1
up	1
to	1
this	1
day	1
have	1
ever	1
been	1
celebrated	1
in	1
La	1
Mancha,	1
or	1
for	1
many	1
a	1
league	1
round.”	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
asked	1
him	1
if	1
it	1
was	1
some	1
prince’s,	1
that	1
he	1
spoke	1
of	1
it	1
in	1
this	1
way.	1
“Not	1
at	1
all,”	1
said	1
the	1
student;	1
“it	1
is	1
the	1
wedding	1
of	1
a	1
farmer	1
and	1
a	1
farmer’s	1
daughter,	1
he	1
the	1
richest	1
in	1
all	1
this	1
country,	1
and	1
she	1
the	1
fairest	1
mortal	1
ever	1
set	1
eyes	1
on.	1
The	1
display	1
with	1
which	1
it	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
attended	1
will	1
be	1
something	1
rare	1
and	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
common,	1
for	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
celebrated	1
in	1
a	1
meadow	1
adjoining	1
the	1
town	1
of	1
the	1
bride,	1
who	1
is	1
called,	1
_par	1
excellence_,	1
Quiteria	1
the	1
fair,	1
as	1
the	1
bridegroom	1
is	1
called	1
Camacho	1
the	1
rich.	1
She	1
is	1
eighteen,	1
and	1
he	1
twenty-two,	1
and	1
they	1
are	1
fairly	1
matched,	1
though	1
some	1
knowing	1
ones,	1
who	1
have	1
all	1
the	1
pedigrees	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
by	1
heart,	1
will	1
have	1
it	1
that	1
the	1
family	1
of	1
the	1
fair	1
Quiteria	1
is	1
better	1
than	1
Camacho’s;	1
but	1
no	1
one	1
minds	1
that	1
now-a-days,	1
for	1
wealth	1
can	1
solder	1
a	1
great	1
many	1
flaws.	1
At	1
any	1
rate,	1
Camacho	1
is	1
free-handed,	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
his	1
fancy	1
to	1
screen	1
the	1
whole	1
meadow	1
with	1
boughs	1
and	1
cover	1
it	1
in	1
overhead,	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
sun	1
will	1
have	1
hard	1
work	1
if	1
he	1
tries	1
to	1
get	1
in	1
to	1
reach	1
the	1
grass	1
that	1
covers	1
the	1
soil.	1
He	1
has	1
provided	1
dancers	1
too,	1
not	1
only	1
sword	1
but	1
also	1
bell-dancers,	1
for	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
town	1
there	1
are	1
those	1
who	1
ring	1
the	1
changes	1
and	1
jingle	1
the	1
bells	1
to	1
perfection;	1
of	1
shoe-dancers	1
I	1
say	1
nothing,	1
for	1
of	1
them	1
he	1
has	1
engaged	1
a	1
host.	1
But	1
none	1
of	1
these	1
things,	1
nor	1
of	1
the	1
many	1
others	1
I	1
have	1
omitted	1
to	1
mention,	1
will	1
do	1
more	1
to	1
make	1
this	1
a	1
memorable	1
wedding	1
than	1
the	1
part	1
which	1
I	1
suspect	1
the	1
despairing	1
Basilio	1
will	1
play	1
in	1
it.	1
This	1
Basilio	1
is	1
a	1
youth	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
village	1
as	1
Quiteria,	1
and	1
he	1
lived	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
next	1
door	1
to	1
that	1
of	1
her	1
parents,	1
of	1
which	1
circumstance	1
Love	1
took	1
advantage	1
to	1
reproduce	1
to	1
the	1
word	1
the	1
long-forgotten	1
loves	1
of	1
Pyramus	1
and	1
Thisbe;	1
for	1
Basilio	1
loved	1
Quiteria	1
from	1
his	1
earliest	1
years,	1
and	1
she	1
responded	1
to	1
his	1
passion	1
with	1
countless	1
modest	1
proofs	1
of	1
affection,	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
loves	1
of	1
the	1
two	1
children,	1
Basilio	1
and	1
Quiteria,	1
were	1
the	1
talk	1
and	1
the	1
amusement	1
of	1
the	1
town.	1
As	1
they	1
grew	1
up,	1
the	1
father	1
of	1
Quiteria	1
made	1
up	1
his	1
mind	1
to	1
refuse	1
Basilio	1
his	1
wonted	1
freedom	1
of	1
access	1
to	1
the	1
house,	1
and	1
to	1
relieve	1
himself	1
of	1
constant	1
doubts	1
and	1
suspicions,	1
he	1
arranged	1
a	1
match	1
for	1
his	1
daughter	1
with	1
the	1
rich	1
Camacho,	1
as	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
approve	1
of	1
marrying	1
her	1
to	1
Basilio,	1
who	1
had	1
not	1
so	1
large	1
a	1
share	1
of	1
the	1
gifts	1
of	1
fortune	1
as	1
of	1
nature;	1
for	1
if	1
the	1
truth	1
be	1
told	1
ungrudgingly,	1
he	1
is	1
the	1
most	1
agile	1
youth	1
we	1
know,	1
a	1
mighty	1
thrower	1
of	1
the	1
bar,	1
a	1
first-rate	1
wrestler,	1
and	1
a	1
great	1
ball-player;	1
he	1
runs	1
like	1
a	1
deer,	1
and	1
leaps	1
better	1
than	1
a	1
goat,	1
bowls	1
over	1
the	1
nine-pins	1
as	1
if	1
by	1
magic,	1
sings	1
like	1
a	1
lark,	1
plays	1
the	1
guitar	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
make	1
it	1
speak,	1
and,	1
above	1
all,	1
handles	1
a	1
sword	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
the	1
best.”	1
“For	1
that	1
excellence	1
alone,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
at	1
this,	1
“the	1
youth	1
deserves	1
to	1
marry,	1
not	1
merely	1
the	1
fair	1
Quiteria,	1
but	1
Queen	1
Guinevere	1
herself,	1
were	1
she	1
alive	1
now,	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
Launcelot	1
and	1
all	1
who	1
would	1
try	1
to	1
prevent	1
it.”	1
“Say	1
that	1
to	1
my	1
wife,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
who	1
had	1
until	1
now	1
listened	1
in	1
silence,	1
“for	1
she	1
won’t	1
hear	1
of	1
anything	1
but	1
each	1
one	1
marrying	1
his	1
equal,	1
holding	1
with	1
the	1
proverb	1
‘each	1
ewe	1
to	1
her	1
like.’	1
What	1
I	1
would	1
like	1
is	1
that	1
this	1
good	1
Basilio	1
(for	1
I	1
am	1
beginning	1
to	1
take	1
a	1
fancy	1
to	1
him	1
already)	1
should	1
marry	1
this	1
lady	1
Quiteria;	1
and	1
a	1
blessing	1
and	1
good	1
luck—I	1
meant	1
to	1
say	1
the	1
opposite—on	1
people	1
who	1
would	1
prevent	1
those	1
who	1
love	1
one	1
another	1
from	1
marrying.”	1
“If	1
all	1
those	1
who	1
love	1
one	1
another	1
were	1
to	1
marry,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“it	1
would	1
deprive	1
parents	1
of	1
the	1
right	1
to	1
choose,	1
and	1
marry	1
their	1
children	1
to	1
the	1
proper	1
person	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
proper	1
time;	1
and	1
if	1
it	1
was	1
left	1
to	1
daughters	1
to	1
choose	1
husbands	1
as	1
they	1
pleased,	1
one	1
would	1
be	1
for	1
choosing	1
her	1
father’s	1
servant,	1
and	1
another,	1
someone	1
she	1
has	1
seen	1
passing	1
in	1
the	1
street	1
and	1
fancies	1
gallant	1
and	1
dashing,	1
though	1
he	1
may	1
be	1
a	1
drunken	1
bully;	1
for	1
love	1
and	1
fancy	1
easily	1
blind	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
the	1
judgment,	1
so	1
much	1
wanted	1
in	1
choosing	1
one’s	1
way	1
of	1
life;	1
and	1
the	1
matrimonial	1
choice	1
is	1
very	1
liable	1
to	1
error,	1
and	1
it	1
needs	1
great	1
caution	1
and	1
the	1
special	1
favour	1
of	1
heaven	1
to	1
make	1
it	1
a	1
good	1
one.	1
He	1
who	1
has	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
long	1
journey,	1
will,	1
if	1
he	1
is	1
wise,	1
look	1
out	1
for	1
some	1
trusty	1
and	1
pleasant	1
companion	1
to	1
accompany	1
him	1
before	1
he	1
sets	1
out.	1
Why,	1
then,	1
should	1
not	1
he	1
do	1
the	1
same	1
who	1
has	1
to	1
make	1
the	1
whole	1
journey	1
of	1
life	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
final	1
halting-place	1
of	1
death,	1
more	1
especially	1
when	1
the	1
companion	1
has	1
to	1
be	1
his	1
companion	1
in	1
bed,	1
at	1
board,	1
and	1
everywhere,	1
as	1
the	1
wife	1
is	1
to	1
her	1
husband?	1
The	1
companionship	1
of	1
one’s	1
wife	1
is	1
no	1
article	1
of	1
merchandise,	1
that,	1
after	1
it	1
has	1
been	1
bought,	1
may	1
be	1
returned,	1
or	1
bartered,	1
or	1
changed;	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
an	1
inseparable	1
accident	1
that	1
lasts	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
life	1
lasts;	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
noose	1
that,	1
once	1
you	1
put	1
it	1
round	1
your	1
neck,	1
turns	1
into	1
a	1
Gordian	1
knot,	1
which,	1
if	1
the	1
scythe	1
of	1
Death	1
does	1
not	1
cut	1
it,	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
untying.	1
I	1
could	1
say	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
more	1
on	1
this	1
subject,	1
were	1
I	1
not	1
prevented	1
by	1
the	1
anxiety	1
I	1
feel	1
to	1
know	1
if	1
the	1
señor	1
licentiate	1
has	1
anything	1
more	1
to	1
tell	1
about	1
the	1
story	1
of	1
Basilio.”	1
To	1
this	1
the	1
student,	1
bachelor,	1
or,	1
as	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
called	1
him,	1
licentiate,	1
replied,	1
“I	1
have	1
nothing	1
whatever	1
to	1
say	1
further,	1
but	1
that	1
from	1
the	1
moment	1
Basilio	1
learned	1
that	1
the	1
fair	1
Quiteria	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
married	1
to	1
Camacho	1
the	1
rich,	1
he	1
has	1
never	1
been	1
seen	1
to	1
smile,	1
or	1
heard	1
to	1
utter	1
rational	1
word,	1
and	1
he	1
always	1
goes	1
about	1
moody	1
and	1
dejected,	1
talking	1
to	1
himself	1
in	1
a	1
way	1
that	1
shows	1
plainly	1
he	1
is	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
senses.	1
He	1
eats	1
little	1
and	1
sleeps	1
little,	1
and	1
all	1
he	1
eats	1
is	1
fruit,	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
sleeps,	1
if	1
he	1
sleeps	1
at	1
all,	1
it	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
field	1
on	1
the	1
hard	1
earth	1
like	1
a	1
brute	1
beast.	1
Sometimes	1
he	1
gazes	1
at	1
the	1
sky,	1
at	1
other	1
times	1
he	1
fixes	1
his	1
eyes	1
on	1
the	1
earth	1
in	1
such	1
an	1
abstracted	1
way	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
be	1
taken	1
for	1
a	1
clothed	1
statue,	1
with	1
its	1
drapery	1
stirred	1
by	1
the	1
wind.	1
In	1
short,	1
he	1
shows	1
such	1
signs	1
of	1
a	1
heart	1
crushed	1
by	1
suffering,	1
that	1
all	1
we	1
who	1
know	1
him	1
believe	1
that	1
when	1
to-morrow	1
the	1
fair	1
Quiteria	1
says	1
‘yes,’	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
his	1
sentence	1
of	1
death.”	1
“God	1
will	1
guide	1
it	1
better,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“for	1
God	1
who	1
gives	1
the	1
wound	1
gives	1
the	1
salve;	1
nobody	1
knows	1
what	1
will	1
happen;	1
there	1
are	1
a	1
good	1
many	1
hours	1
between	1
this	1
and	1
to-morrow,	1
and	1
any	1
one	1
of	1
them,	1
or	1
any	1
moment,	1
the	1
house	1
may	1
fall;	1
I	1
have	1
seen	1
the	1
rain	1
coming	1
down	1
and	1
the	1
sun	1
shining	1
all	1
at	1
one	1
time;	1
many	1
a	1
one	1
goes	1
to	1
bed	1
in	1
good	1
health	1
who	1
can’t	1
stir	1
the	1
next	1
day.	1
And	1
tell	1
me,	1
is	1
there	1
anyone	1
who	1
can	1
boast	1
of	1
having	1
driven	1
a	1
nail	1
into	1
the	1
wheel	1
of	1
fortune?	1
No,	1
faith;	1
and	1
between	1
a	1
woman’s	1
‘yes’	1
and	1
‘no’	1
I	1
wouldn’t	1
venture	1
to	1
put	1
the	1
point	1
of	1
a	1
pin,	1
for	1
there	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
room	1
for	1
it;	1
if	1
you	1
tell	1
me	1
Quiteria	1
loves	1
Basilio	1
heart	1
and	1
soul,	1
then	1
I’ll	1
give	1
him	1
a	1
bag	1
of	1
good	1
luck;	1
for	1
love,	1
I	1
have	1
heard	1
say,	1
looks	1
through	1
spectacles	1
that	1
make	1
copper	1
seem	1
gold,	1
poverty	1
wealth,	1
and	1
bleary	1
eyes	1
pearls.”	1
“What	1
art	1
thou	1
driving	1
at,	1
Sancho?	1
curses	1
on	1
thee!”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
“for	1
when	1
thou	1
takest	1
to	1
stringing	1
proverbs	1
and	1
sayings	1
together,	1
no	1
one	1
can	1
understand	1
thee	1
but	1
Judas	1
himself,	1
and	1
I	1
wish	1
he	1
had	1
thee.	1
Tell	1
me,	1
thou	1
animal,	1
what	1
dost	1
thou	1
know	1
about	1
nails	1
or	1
wheels,	1
or	1
anything	1
else?”	1
“Oh,	1
if	1
you	1
don’t	1
understand	1
me,”	1
replied	1
Sancho,	1
“it	1
is	1
no	1
wonder	1
my	1
words	1
are	1
taken	1
for	1
nonsense;	1
but	1
no	1
matter;	1
I	1
understand	1
myself,	1
and	1
I	1
know	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
said	1
anything	1
very	1
foolish	1
in	1
what	1
I	1
have	1
said;	1
only	1
your	1
worship,	1
señor,	1
is	1
always	1
gravelling	1
at	1
everything	1
I	1
say,	1
nay,	1
everything	1
I	1
do.”	1
“Cavilling,	1
not	1
gravelling,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“thou	1
prevaricator	1
of	1
honest	1
language,	1
God	1
confound	1
thee!”	1
“Don’t	1
find	1
fault	1
with	1
me,	1
your	1
worship,”	1
returned	1
Sancho,	1
“for	1
you	1
know	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
been	1
bred	1
up	1
at	1
court	1
or	1
trained	1
at	1
Salamanca,	1
to	1
know	1
whether	1
I	1
am	1
adding	1
or	1
dropping	1
a	1
letter	1
or	1
so	1
in	1
my	1
words.	1
Why!	1
God	1
bless	1
me,	1
it’s	1
not	1
fair	1
to	1
force	1
a	1
Sayago-man	1
to	1
speak	1
like	1
a	1
Toledan;	1
maybe	1
there	1
are	1
Toledans	1
who	1
do	1
not	1
hit	1
it	1
off	1
when	1
it	1
comes	1
to	1
polished	1
talk.”	1
“That	1
is	1
true,”	1
said	1
the	1
licentiate,	1
“for	1
those	1
who	1
have	1
been	1
bred	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
Tanneries	1
and	1
the	1
Zocodover	1
cannot	1
talk	1
like	1
those	1
who	1
are	1
almost	1
all	1
day	1
pacing	1
the	1
cathedral	1
cloisters,	1
and	1
yet	1
they	1
are	1
all	1
Toledans.	1
Pure,	1
correct,	1
elegant	1
and	1
lucid	1
language	1
will	1
be	1
met	1
with	1
in	1
men	1
of	1
courtly	1
breeding	1
and	1
discrimination,	1
though	1
they	1
may	1
have	1
been	1
born	1
in	1
Majalahonda;	1
I	1
say	1
of	1
discrimination,	1
because	1
there	1
are	1
many	1
who	1
are	1
not	1
so,	1
and	1
discrimination	1
is	1
the	1
grammar	1
of	1
good	1
language,	1
if	1
it	1
be	1
accompanied	1
by	1
practice.	1
I,	1
sirs,	1
for	1
my	1
sins	1
have	1
studied	1
canon	1
law	1
at	1
Salamanca,	1
and	1
I	1
rather	1
pique	1
myself	1
on	1
expressing	1
my	1
meaning	1
in	1
clear,	1
plain,	1
and	1
intelligible	1
language.”	1
“If	1
you	1
did	1
not	1
pique	1
yourself	1
more	1
on	1
your	1
dexterity	1
with	1
those	1
foils	1
you	1
carry	1
than	1
on	1
dexterity	1
of	1
tongue,”	1
said	1
the	1
other	1
student,	1
“you	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
degrees,	1
where	1
you	1
are	1
now	1
tail.”	1
“Look	1
here,	1
bachelor	1
Corchuelo,”	1
returned	1
the	1
licentiate,	1
“you	1
have	1
the	1
most	1
mistaken	1
idea	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
about	1
skill	1
with	1
the	1
sword,	1
if	1
you	1
think	1
it	1
useless.”	1
“It	1
is	1
no	1
idea	1
on	1
my	1
part,	1
but	1
an	1
established	1
truth,”	1
replied	1
Corchuelo;	1
“and	1
if	1
you	1
wish	1
me	1
to	1
prove	1
it	1
to	1
you	1
by	1
experiment,	1
you	1
have	1
swords	1
there,	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
good	1
opportunity;	1
I	1
have	1
a	1
steady	1
hand	1
and	1
a	1
strong	1
arm,	1
and	1
these	1
joined	1
with	1
my	1
resolution,	1
which	1
is	1
not	1
small,	1
will	1
make	1
you	1
confess	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
mistaken.	1
Dismount	1
and	1
put	1
in	1
practice	1
your	1
positions	1
and	1
circles	1
and	1
angles	1
and	1
science,	1
for	1
I	1
hope	1
to	1
make	1
you	1
see	1
stars	1
at	1
noonday	1
with	1
my	1
rude	1
raw	1
swordsmanship,	1
in	1
which,	1
next	1
to	1
God,	1
I	1
place	1
my	1
trust	1
that	1
the	1
man	1
is	1
yet	1
to	1
be	1
born	1
who	1
will	1
make	1
me	1
turn	1
my	1
back,	1
and	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
not	1
one	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
compel	1
to	1
give	1
ground.”	1
“As	1
to	1
whether	1
you	1
turn	1
your	1
back	1
or	1
not,	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
concern	1
myself,”	1
replied	1
the	1
master	1
of	1
fence;	1
“though	1
it	1
might	1
be	1
that	1
your	1
grave	1
would	1
be	1
dug	1
on	1
the	1
spot	1
where	1
you	1
planted	1
your	1
foot	1
the	1
first	1
time;	1
I	1
mean	1
that	1
you	1
would	1
be	1
stretched	1
dead	1
there	1
for	1
despising	1
skill	1
with	1
the	1
sword.”	1
“We	1
shall	1
soon	1
see,”	1
replied	1
Corchuelo,	1
and	1
getting	1
off	1
his	1
ass	1
briskly,	1
he	1
drew	1
out	1
furiously	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
swords	1
the	1
licentiate	1
carried	1
on	1
his	1
beast.	1
“It	1
must	1
not	1
be	1
that	1
way,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
at	1
this	1
point;	1
“I	1
will	1
be	1
the	1
director	1
of	1
this	1
fencing	1
match,	1
and	1
judge	1
of	1
this	1
often	1
disputed	1
question;”	1
and	1
dismounting	1
from	1
Rocinante	1
and	1
grasping	1
his	1
lance,	1
he	1
planted	1
himself	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
road,	1
just	1
as	1
the	1
licentiate,	1
with	1
an	1
easy,	1
graceful	1
bearing	1
and	1
step,	1
advanced	1
towards	1
Corchuelo,	1
who	1
came	1
on	1
against	1
him,	1
darting	1
fire	1
from	1
his	1
eyes,	1
as	1
the	1
saying	1
is.	1
The	1
other	1
two	1
of	1
the	1
company,	1
the	1
peasants,	1
without	1
dismounting	1
from	1
their	1
asses,	1
served	1
as	1
spectators	1
of	1
the	1
mortal	1
tragedy.	1
The	1
cuts,	1
thrusts,	1
down	1
strokes,	1
back	1
strokes	1
and	1
doubles,	1
that	1
Corchuelo	1
delivered	1
were	1
past	1
counting,	1
and	1
came	1
thicker	1
than	1
hops	1
or	1
hail.	1
He	1
attacked	1
like	1
an	1
angry	1
lion,	1
but	1
he	1
was	1
met	1
by	1
a	1
tap	1
on	1
the	1
mouth	1
from	1
the	1
button	1
of	1
the	1
licentiate’s	1
sword	1
that	1
checked	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
his	1
furious	1
onset,	1
and	1
made	1
him	1
kiss	1
it	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
a	1
relic,	1
though	1
not	1
as	1
devoutly	1
as	1
relics	1
are	1
and	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
kissed.	1
The	1
end	1
of	1
it	1
was	1
that	1
the	1
licentiate	1
reckoned	1
up	1
for	1
him	1
by	1
thrusts	1
every	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
buttons	1
of	1
the	1
short	1
cassock	1
he	1
wore,	1
tore	1
the	1
skirts	1
into	1
strips,	1
like	1
the	1
tails	1
of	1
a	1
cuttlefish,	1
knocked	1
off	1
his	1
hat	1
twice,	1
and	1
so	1
completely	1
tired	1
him	1
out,	1
that	1
in	1
vexation,	1
anger,	1
and	1
rage,	1
he	1
took	1
the	1
sword	1
by	1
the	1
hilt	1
and	1
flung	1
it	1
away	1
with	1
such	1
force,	1
that	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
peasants	1
that	1
were	1
there,	1
who	1
was	1
a	1
notary,	1
and	1
who	1
went	1
for	1
it,	1
made	1
an	1
affidavit	1
afterwards	1
that	1
he	1
sent	1
it	1
nearly	1
three-quarters	1
of	1
a	1
league,	1
which	1
testimony	1
will	1
serve,	1
and	1
has	1
served,	1
to	1
show	1
and	1
establish	1
with	1
all	1
certainty	1
that	1
strength	1
is	1
overcome	1
by	1
skill.	1
Corchuelo	1
sat	1
down	1
wearied,	1
and	1
Sancho	1
approaching	1
him	1
said,	1
“By	1
my	1
faith,	1
señor	1
bachelor,	1
if	1
your	1
worship	1
takes	1
my	1
advice,	1
you	1
will	1
never	1
challenge	1
anyone	1
to	1
fence	1
again,	1
only	1
to	1
wrestle	1
and	1
throw	1
the	1
bar,	1
for	1
you	1
have	1
the	1
youth	1
and	1
strength	1
for	1
that;	1
but	1
as	1
for	1
these	1
fencers	1
as	1
they	1
call	1
them,	1
I	1
have	1
heard	1
say	1
they	1
can	1
put	1
the	1
point	1
of	1
a	1
sword	1
through	1
the	1
eye	1
of	1
a	1
needle.”	1
“I	1
am	1
satisfied	1
with	1
having	1
tumbled	1
off	1
my	1
donkey,”	1
said	1
Corchuelo,	1
“and	1
with	1
having	1
had	1
the	1
truth	1
I	1
was	1
so	1
ignorant	1
of	1
proved	1
to	1
me	1
by	1
experience;”	1
and	1
getting	1
up	1
he	1
embraced	1
the	1
licentiate,	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
better	1
friends	1
than	1
ever;	1
and	1
not	1
caring	1
to	1
wait	1
for	1
the	1
notary	1
who	1
had	1
gone	1
for	1
the	1
sword,	1
as	1
they	1
saw	1
he	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
about	1
it,	1
they	1
resolved	1
to	1
push	1
on	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
reach	1
the	1
village	1
of	1
Quiteria,	1
to	1
which	1
they	1
all	1
belonged,	1
in	1
good	1
time.	1
During	1
the	1
remainder	1
of	1
the	1
journey	1
the	1
licentiate	1
held	1
forth	1
to	1
them	1
on	1
the	1
excellences	1
of	1
the	1
sword,	1
with	1
such	1
conclusive	1
arguments,	1
and	1
such	1
figures	1
and	1
mathematical	1
proofs,	1
that	1
all	1
were	1
convinced	1
of	1
the	1
value	1
of	1
the	1
science,	1
and	1
Corchuelo	1
cured	1
of	1
his	1
dogmatism.	1
It	1
grew	1
dark;	1
but	1
before	1
they	1
reached	1
the	1
town	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
them	1
all	1
as	1
if	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
heaven	1
full	1
of	1
countless	1
glittering	1
stars	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
it.	1
They	1
heard,	1
too,	1
the	1
pleasant	1
mingled	1
notes	1
of	1
a	1
variety	1
of	1
instruments,	1
flutes,	1
drums,	1
psalteries,	1
pipes,	1
tabors,	1
and	1
timbrels,	1
and	1
as	1
they	1
drew	1
near	1
they	1
perceived	1
that	1
the	1
trees	1
of	1
a	1
leafy	1
arcade	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
constructed	1
at	1
the	1
entrance	1
of	1
the	1
town	1
were	1
filled	1
with	1
lights	1
unaffected	1
by	1
the	1
wind,	1
for	1
the	1
breeze	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
was	1
so	1
gentle	1
that	1
it	1
had	1
not	1
power	1
to	1
stir	1
the	1
leaves	1
on	1
the	1
trees.	1
The	1
musicians	1
were	1
the	1
life	1
of	1
the	1
wedding,	1
wandering	1
through	1
the	1
pleasant	1
grounds	1
in	1
separate	1
bands,	1
some	1
dancing,	1
others	1
singing,	1
others	1
playing	1
the	1
various	1
instruments	1
already	1
mentioned.	1
In	1
short,	1
it	1
seemed	1
as	1
though	1
mirth	1
and	1
gaiety	1
were	1
frisking	1
and	1
gambolling	1
all	1
over	1
the	1
meadow.	1
Several	1
other	1
persons	1
were	1
engaged	1
in	1
erecting	1
raised	1
benches	1
from	1
which	1
people	1
might	1
conveniently	1
see	1
the	1
plays	1
and	1
dances	1
that	1
were	1
to	1
be	1
performed	1
the	1
next	1
day	1
on	1
the	1
spot	1
dedicated	1
to	1
the	1
celebration	1
of	1
the	1
marriage	1
of	1
Camacho	1
the	1
rich	1
and	1
the	1
obsequies	1
of	1
Basilio.	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
would	1
not	1
enter	1
the	1
village,	1
although	1
the	1
peasant	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
the	1
bachelor	1
pressed	1
him;	1
he	1
excused	1
himself,	1
however,	1
on	1
the	1
grounds,	1
amply	1
sufficient	1
in	1
his	1
opinion,	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
custom	1
of	1
knights-errant	1
to	1
sleep	1
in	1
the	1
fields	1
and	1
woods	1
in	1
preference	1
to	1
towns,	1
even	1
were	1
it	1
under	1
gilded	1
ceilings;	1
and	1
so	1
turned	1
aside	1
a	1
little	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
road,	1
very	1
much	1
against	1
Sancho’s	1
will,	1
as	1
the	1
good	1
quarters	1
he	1
had	1
enjoyed	1
in	1
the	1
castle	1
or	1
house	1
of	1
Don	1
Diego	1
came	1
back	1
to	1
his	1
mind.	1

Don	1
Quixote,	1
shaking	1
off	1

from	1
his	1
limbs,	1
sprang	1
to	1
his	1
feet	1
and	1
called	1
to	1
his	1
squire	1
Sancho,	1
who	1
was	1
still	1
snoring;	1
seeing	1
which	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
ere	1
he	1
roused	1
him	1
thus	1
addressed	1
him:	1
“Happy	1
thou,	1
above	1
all	1
the	1
dwellers	1
on	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
that,	1
without	1
envying	1
or	1
being	1
envied,	1
sleepest	1
with	1
tranquil	1
mind,	1
and	1
that	1
neither	1
enchanters	1
persecute	1
nor	1
enchantments	1
affright.	1
Sleep,	1
I	1
say,	1
and	1
will	1
say	1
a	1
hundred	1
times,	1
without	1
any	1
jealous	1
thoughts	1
of	1
thy	1
mistress	1
to	1
make	1
thee	1
keep	1
ceaseless	1
vigils,	1
or	1
any	1
cares	1
as	1
to	1
how	1
thou	1
art	1
to	1
pay	1
the	1
debts	1
thou	1
owest,	1
or	1
find	1
to-morrow’s	1
food	1
for	1
thyself	1
and	1
thy	1
needy	1
little	1
family,	1
to	1
interfere	1
with	1
thy	1
repose.	1
Ambition	1
breaks	1
not	1
thy	1
rest,	1
nor	1
doth	1
this	1
world’s	1
empty	1
pomp	1
disturb	1
thee,	1
for	1
the	1
utmost	1
reach	1
of	1
thy	1
anxiety	1
is	1
to	1
provide	1
for	1
thy	1
ass,	1
since	1
upon	1
my	1
shoulders	1
thou	1
hast	1
laid	1
the	1
support	1
of	1
thyself,	1
the	1
counterpoise	1
and	1
burden	1
that	1
nature	1
and	1
custom	1
have	1
imposed	1
upon	1
masters.	1
The	1
servant	1
sleeps	1
and	1
the	1
master	1
lies	1
awake	1
thinking	1
how	1
he	1
is	1
to	1
feed	1
him,	1
advance	1
him,	1
and	1
reward	1
him.	1
The	1
distress	1
of	1
seeing	1
the	1
sky	1
turn	1
brazen,	1
and	1
withhold	1
its	1
needful	1
moisture	1
from	1
the	1
earth,	1
is	1
not	1
felt	1
by	1
the	1
servant	1
but	1
by	1
the	1
master,	1
who	1
in	1
time	1
of	1
scarcity	1
and	1
famine	1
must	1
support	1
him	1
who	1
has	1
served	1
him	1
in	1
times	1
of	1
plenty	1
and	1
abundance.”	1

To	1
all	1
this	1
Sancho	1
made	1
no	1
reply	1
because	1
he	1
was	1
asleep,	1
nor	1
would	1
he	1
have	1
wakened	1
up	1
so	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
did	1
had	1
not	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
brought	1
him	1
to	1
his	1
senses	1
with	1
the	1
butt	1
of	1
his	1
lance.	1
He	1
awoke	1
at	1
last,	1
drowsy	1
and	1
lazy,	1
and	1
casting	1
his	1
eyes	1
about	1
in	1
every	1
direction,	1
observed,	1
“There	1
comes,	1
if	1
I	1
don’t	1
mistake,	1
from	1
the	1
quarter	1
of	1
that	1
arcade	1
a	1
steam	1
and	1
a	1
smell	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
more	1
like	1
fried	1
rashers	1
than	1
galingale	1
or	1
thyme;	1
a	1
wedding	1
that	1
begins	1
with	1
smells	1
like	1
that,	1
by	1
my	1
faith,	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
plentiful	1
and	1
unstinting.”	1
“Have	1
done,	1
thou	1
glutton,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
“come,	1
let	1
us	1
go	1
and	1
witness	1
this	1
bridal,	1
and	1
see	1
what	1
the	1
rejected	1
Basilio	1
does.”	1
“Let	1
him	1
do	1
what	1
he	1
likes,”	1
returned	1
Sancho;	1
“be	1
he	1
not	1
poor,	1
he	1
would	1
marry	1
Quiteria.	1
To	1
make	1
a	1
grand	1
match	1
for	1
himself,	1
and	1
he	1
without	1
a	1
farthing;	1
is	1
there	1
nothing	1
else?	1
Faith,	1
señor,	1
it’s	1
my	1
opinion	1
the	1
poor	1
man	1
should	1
be	1
content	1
with	1
what	1
he	1
can	1
get,	1
and	1
not	1
go	1
looking	1
for	1
dainties	1
in	1
the	1
bottom	1
of	1
the	1
sea.	1
I	1
will	1
bet	1
my	1
arm	1
that	1
Camacho	1
could	1
bury	1
Basilio	1
in	1
reals;	1
and	1
if	1
that	1
be	1
so,	1
as	1
no	1
doubt	1
it	1
is,	1
what	1
a	1
fool	1
Quiteria	1
would	1
be	1
to	1
refuse	1
the	1
fine	1
dresses	1
and	1
jewels	1
Camacho	1
must	1
have	1
given	1
her	1
and	1
will	1
give	1
her,	1
and	1
take	1
Basilio’s	1
bar-throwing	1
and	1
sword-play.	1
They	1
won’t	1
give	1
a	1
pint	1
of	1
wine	1
at	1
the	1
tavern	1
for	1
a	1
good	1
cast	1
of	1
the	1
bar	1
or	1
a	1
neat	1
thrust	1
of	1
the	1
sword.	1
Talents	1
and	1
accomplishments	1
that	1
can’t	1
be	1
turned	1
into	1
money,	1
let	1
Count	1
Dirlos	1
have	1
them;	1
but	1
when	1
such	1
gifts	1
fall	1
to	1
one	1
that	1
has	1
hard	1
cash,	1
I	1
wish	1
my	1
condition	1
of	1
life	1
was	1
as	1
becoming	1
as	1
they	1
are.	1
On	1
a	1
good	1
foundation	1
you	1
can	1
raise	1
a	1
good	1
building,	1
and	1
the	1
best	1
foundation	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
is	1
money.”	1
“For	1
God’s	1
sake,	1
Sancho,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
here,	1
“stop	1
that	1
harangue;	1
it	1
is	1
my	1
belief,	1
if	1
thou	1
wert	1
allowed	1
to	1
continue	1
all	1
thou	1
beginnest	1
every	1
instant,	1
thou	1
wouldst	1
have	1
no	1
time	1
left	1
for	1
eating	1
or	1
sleeping;	1
for	1
thou	1
wouldst	1
spend	1
it	1
all	1
in	1
talking.”	1
“If	1
your	1
worship	1
had	1
a	1
good	1
memory,”	1
replied	1
Sancho,	1
“you	1
would	1
remember	1
the	1
articles	1
of	1
our	1
agreement	1
before	1
we	1
started	1
from	1
home	1
this	1
last	1
time;	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
was	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
let	1
say	1
all	1
I	1
liked,	1
so	1
long	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
against	1
my	1
neighbour	1
or	1
your	1
worship’s	1
authority;	1
and	1
so	1
far,	1
it	1
seems	1
to	1
me,	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
broken	1
the	1
said	1
article.”	1
“I	1
remember	1
no	1
such	1
article,	1
Sancho,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
“and	1
even	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
so,	1
I	1
desire	1
you	1
to	1
hold	1
your	1
tongue	1
and	1
come	1
along;	1
for	1
the	1
instruments	1
we	1
heard	1
last	1
night	1
are	1
already	1
beginning	1
to	1
enliven	1
the	1
valleys	1
again,	1
and	1
no	1
doubt	1
the	1
marriage	1
will	1
take	1
place	1
in	1
the	1
cool	1
of	1
the	1
morning,	1
and	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
heat	1
of	1
the	1
afternoon.”	1
Sancho	1
did	1
as	1
his	1
master	1
bade	1
him,	1
and	1
putting	1
the	1
saddle	1
on	1
Rocinante	1
and	1
the	1
pack-saddle	1
on	1
Dapple,	1
they	1
both	1
mounted	1
and	1
at	1
a	1
leisurely	1
pace	1
entered	1
the	1
arcade.	1
The	1
first	1
thing	1
that	1
presented	1
itself	1
to	1
Sancho’s	1
eyes	1
was	1
a	1
whole	1
ox	1
spitted	1
on	1
a	1
whole	1
elm	1
tree,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
fire	1
at	1
which	1
it	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
roasted	1
there	1
was	1
burning	1
a	1
middling-sized	1
mountain	1
of	1
faggots,	1
and	1
six	1
stewpots	1
that	1
stood	1
round	1
the	1
blaze	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
made	1
in	1
the	1
ordinary	1
mould	1
of	1
common	1
pots,	1
for	1
they	1
were	1
six	1
half	1
wine-jars,	1
each	1
fit	1
to	1
hold	1
the	1
contents	1
of	1
a	1
slaughter-house;	1
they	1
swallowed	1
up	1
whole	1
sheep	1
and	1
hid	1
them	1
away	1
in	1
their	1
insides	1
without	1
showing	1
any	1
more	1
sign	1
of	1
them	1
than	1
if	1
they	1
were	1
pigeons.	1
Countless	1
were	1
the	1
hares	1
ready	1
skinned	1
and	1
the	1
plucked	1
fowls	1
that	1
hung	1
on	1
the	1
trees	1
for	1
burial	1
in	1
the	1
pots,	1
numberless	1
the	1
wildfowl	1
and	1
game	1
of	1
various	1
sorts	1
suspended	1
from	1
the	1
branches	1
that	1
the	1
air	1
might	1
keep	1
them	1
cool.	1
Sancho	1
counted	1
more	1
than	1
sixty	1
wine	1
skins	1
of	1
over	1
six	1
gallons	1
each,	1
and	1
all	1
filled,	1
as	1
it	1
proved	1
afterwards,	1
with	1
generous	1
wines.	1
There	1
were,	1
besides,	1
piles	1
of	1
the	1
whitest	1
bread,	1
like	1
the	1
heaps	1
of	1
corn	1
one	1
sees	1
on	1
the	1
threshing-floors.	1
There	1
was	1
a	1
wall	1
made	1
of	1
cheeses	1
arranged	1
like	1
open	1
brick-work,	1
and	1
two	1
cauldrons	1
full	1
of	1
oil,	1
bigger	1
than	1
those	1
of	1
a	1
dyer’s	1
shop,	1
served	1
for	1
cooking	1
fritters,	1
which	1
when	1
fried	1
were	1
taken	1
out	1
with	1
two	1
mighty	1
shovels,	1
and	1
plunged	1
into	1
another	1
cauldron	1
of	1
prepared	1
honey	1
that	1
stood	1
close	1
by.	1
Of	1
cooks	1
and	1
cook-maids	1
there	1
were	1
over	1
fifty,	1
all	1
clean,	1
brisk,	1
and	1
blithe.	1
In	1
the	1
capacious	1
belly	1
of	1
the	1
ox	1
were	1
a	1
dozen	1
soft	1
little	1
sucking-pigs,	1
which,	1
sewn	1
up	1
there,	1
served	1
to	1
give	1
it	1
tenderness	1
and	1
flavour.	1
The	1
spices	1
of	1
different	1
kinds	1
did	1
not	1
seem	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
bought	1
by	1
the	1
pound	1
but	1
by	1
the	1
quarter,	1
and	1
all	1
lay	1
open	1
to	1
view	1
in	1
a	1
great	1
chest.	1
In	1
short,	1
all	1
the	1
preparations	1
made	1
for	1
the	1
wedding	1
were	1
in	1
rustic	1
style,	1
but	1
abundant	1
enough	1
to	1
feed	1
an	1
army.	1

Sancho	1
observed	1
all,	1
contemplated	1
all,	1
and	1
everything	1
won	1
his	1
heart.	1
The	1
first	1
to	1
captivate	1
and	1
take	1
his	1
fancy	1
were	1
the	1
pots,	1
out	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
very	1
gladly	1
helped	1
himself	1
to	1
a	1
moderate	1
pipkinful;	1
then	1
the	1
wine	1
skins	1
secured	1
his	1
affections;	1
and	1
lastly,	1
the	1
produce	1
of	1
the	1
frying-pans,	1
if,	1
indeed,	1
such	1
imposing	1
cauldrons	1
may	1
be	1
called	1
frying-pans;	1
and	1
unable	1
to	1
control	1
himself	1
or	1
bear	1
it	1
any	1
longer,	1
he	1
approached	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
busy	1
cooks	1
and	1
civilly	1
but	1
hungrily	1
begged	1
permission	1
to	1
soak	1
a	1
scrap	1
of	1
bread	1
in	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
pots;	1
to	1
which	1
the	1
cook	1
made	1
answer,	1
“Brother,	1
this	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
day	1
on	1
which	1
hunger	1
is	1
to	1
have	1
any	1
sway,	1
thanks	1
to	1
the	1
rich	1
Camacho;	1
get	1
down	1
and	1
look	1
about	1
for	1
a	1
ladle	1
and	1
skim	1
off	1
a	1
hen	1
or	1
two,	1
and	1
much	1
good	1
may	1
they	1
do	1
you.”	1
“I	1
don’t	1
see	1
one,”	1
said	1
Sancho.	1
“Wait	1
a	1
bit,”	1
said	1
the	1
cook;	1
“sinner	1
that	1
I	1
am!	1
how	1
particular	1
and	1
bashful	1
you	1
are!”	1
and	1
so	1
saying,	1
he	1
seized	1
a	1
bucket	1
and	1
plunging	1
it	1
into	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
half	1
jars	1
took	1
up	1
three	1
hens	1
and	1
a	1
couple	1
of	1
geese,	1
and	1
said	1
to	1
Sancho,	1
“Fall	1
to,	1
friend,	1
and	1
take	1
the	1
edge	1
off	1
your	1
appetite	1
with	1
these	1
skimmings	1
until	1
dinner-time	1
comes.”	1

“I	1
have	1
nothing	1
to	1
put	1
them	1
in,”	1
said	1
Sancho.	1
“Well	1
then,”	1
said	1
the	1
cook,	1
“take	1
spoon	1
and	1
all;	1
for	1
Camacho’s	1
wealth	1
and	1
happiness	1
furnish	1
everything.”	1
While	1
Sancho	1
fared	1
thus,	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
was	1
watching	1
the	1
entrance,	1
at	1
one	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
arcade,	1
of	1
some	1
twelve	1
peasants,	1
all	1
in	1
holiday	1
and	1
gala	1
dress,	1
mounted	1
on	1
twelve	1
beautiful	1
mares	1
with	1
rich	1
handsome	1
field	1
trappings	1
and	1
a	1
number	1
of	1
little	1
bells	1
attached	1
to	1
their	1
petrals,	1
who,	1
marshalled	1
in	1
regular	1
order,	1
ran	1
not	1
one	1
but	1
several	1
courses	1
over	1
the	1
meadow,	1
with	1
jubilant	1
shouts	1
and	1
cries	1
of	1
“Long	1
live	1
Camacho	1
and	1
Quiteria!	1
he	1
as	1
rich	1
as	1
she	1
is	1
fair;	1
and	1
she	1
the	1
fairest	1
on	1
earth!”	1
Hearing	1
this,	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
said	1
to	1
himself,	1
“It	1
is	1
easy	1
to	1
see	1
these	1
folk	1
have	1
never	1
seen	1
my	1
Dulcinea	1
del	1
Toboso;	1
for	1
if	1
they	1
had	1
they	1
would	1
be	1
more	1
moderate	1
in	1
their	1
praises	1
of	1
this	1
Quiteria	1
of	1
theirs.”	1
Shortly	1
after	1
this,	1
several	1
bands	1
of	1
dancers	1
of	1
various	1
sorts	1
began	1
to	1
enter	1
the	1
arcade	1
at	1
different	1
points,	1
and	1
among	1
them	1
one	1
of	1
sword-dancers	1
composed	1
of	1
some	1
four-and-twenty	1
lads	1
of	1
gallant	1
and	1
high-spirited	1
mien,	1
clad	1
in	1
the	1
finest	1
and	1
whitest	1
of	1
linen,	1
and	1
with	1
handkerchiefs	1
embroidered	1
in	1
various	1
colours	1
with	1
fine	1
silk;	1
and	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
on	1
the	1
mares	1
asked	1
an	1
active	1
youth	1
who	1
led	1
them	1
if	1
any	1
of	1
the	1
dancers	1
had	1
been	1
wounded.	1
“As	1
yet,	1
thank	1
God,	1
no	1
one	1
has	1
been	1
wounded,”	1
said	1
he,	1
“we	1
are	1
all	1
safe	1
and	1
sound;”	1
and	1
he	1
at	1
once	1
began	1
to	1
execute	1
complicated	1
figures	1
with	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
his	1
comrades,	1
with	1
so	1
many	1
turns	1
and	1
so	1
great	1
dexterity,	1
that	1
although	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
was	1
well	1
used	1
to	1
see	1
dances	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
kind,	1
he	1
thought	1
he	1
had	1
never	1
seen	1
any	1
so	1
good	1
as	1
this.	1
He	1
also	1
admired	1
another	1
that	1
came	1
in	1
composed	1
of	1
fair	1
young	1
maidens,	1
none	1
of	1
whom	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
under	1
fourteen	1
or	1
over	1
eighteen	1
years	1
of	1
age,	1
all	1
clad	1
in	1
green	1
stuff,	1
with	1
their	1
locks	1
partly	1
braided,	1
partly	1
flowing	1
loose,	1
but	1
all	1
of	1
such	1
bright	1
gold	1
as	1
to	1
vie	1
with	1
the	1
sunbeams,	1
and	1
over	1
them	1
they	1
wore	1
garlands	1
of	1
jessamine,	1
roses,	1
amaranth,	1
and	1
honeysuckle.	1
At	1
their	1
head	1
were	1
a	1
venerable	1
old	1
man	1
and	1
an	1
ancient	1
dame,	1
more	1
brisk	1
and	1
active,	1
however,	1
than	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
expected	1
from	1
their	1
years.	1
The	1
notes	1
of	1
a	1
Zamora	1
bagpipe	1
accompanied	1
them,	1
and	1
with	1
modesty	1
in	1
their	1
countenances	1
and	1
in	1
their	1
eyes,	1
and	1
lightness	1
in	1
their	1
feet,	1
they	1
looked	1
the	1
best	1
dancers	1
in	1
the	1
world.	1

Following	1
these	1
there	1
came	1
an	1
artistic	1
dance	1
of	1
the	1
sort	1
they	1
call	1
“speaking	1
dances.”	1
It	1
was	1
composed	1
of	1
eight	1
nymphs	1
in	1
two	1
files,	1
with	1
the	1
god	1
Cupid	1
leading	1
one	1
and	1
Interest	1
the	1
other,	1
the	1
former	1
furnished	1
with	1
wings,	1
bow,	1
quiver	1
and	1
arrows,	1
the	1
latter	1
in	1
a	1
rich	1
dress	1
of	1
gold	1
and	1
silk	1
of	1
divers	1
colours.	1
The	1
nymphs	1
that	1
followed	1
Love	1
bore	1
their	1
names	1
written	1
on	1
white	1
parchment	1
in	1
large	1
letters	1
on	1
their	1
backs.	1
“Poetry”	1
was	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
first,	1
“Wit”	1
of	1
the	1
second,	1
“Birth”	1
of	1
the	1
third,	1
and	1
“Valour”	1
of	1
the	1
fourth.	1
Those	1
that	1
followed	1
Interest	1
were	1
distinguished	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
way;	1
the	1
badge	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
announced	1
“Liberality,”	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
second	1
“Largess,”	1
the	1
third	1
“Treasure,”	1
and	1
the	1
fourth	1
“Peaceful	1
Possession.”	1
In	1
front	1
of	1
them	1
all	1
came	1
a	1
wooden	1
castle	1
drawn	1
by	1
four	1
wild	1
men,	1
all	1
clad	1
in	1
ivy	1
and	1
hemp	1
stained	1
green,	1
and	1
looking	1
so	1
natural	1
that	1
they	1
nearly	1
terrified	1
Sancho.	1
On	1
the	1
front	1
of	1
the	1
castle	1
and	1
on	1
each	1
of	1
the	1
four	1
sides	1
of	1
its	1
frame	1
it	1
bore	1
the	1
inscription	1
“Castle	1
of	1
Caution.”	1
Four	1
skillful	1
tabor	1
and	1
flute	1
players	1
accompanied	1
them,	1
and	1
the	1
dance	1
having	1
been	1
opened,	1
Cupid,	1
after	1
executing	1
two	1
figures,	1
raised	1
his	1
eyes	1
and	1
bent	1
his	1
bow	1
against	1
a	1
damsel	1
who	1
stood	1
between	1
the	1
turrets	1
of	1
the	1
castle,	1
and	1
thus	1
addressed	1
her:	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
mighty	1
God	1
whose	1
sway	1
Is	1
potent	1
over	1
land	1
and	1
sea.	1
The	1
heavens	1
above	1
us	1
own	1
me;	1
nay,	1
The	1
shades	1
below	1
acknowledge	1
me.	1
I	1
know	1
not	1
fear,	1
I	1
have	1
my	1
will,	1
Whate’er	1
my	1
whim	1
or	1
fancy	1
be;	1
For	1
me	1
there’s	1
no	1
impossible,	1
I	1
order,	1
bind,	1
forbid,	1
set	1
free.	1
Having	1
concluded	1
the	1
stanza	1
he	1
discharged	1
an	1
arrow	1
at	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
castle,	1
and	1
went	1
back	1
to	1
his	1
place.	1
Interest	1
then	1
came	1
forward	1
and	1
went	1
through	1
two	1
more	1
figures,	1
and	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
the	1
tabors	1
ceased,	1
he	1
said:	1
But	1
mightier	1
than	1
Love	1
am	1
I,	1
Though	1
Love	1
it	1
be	1
that	1
leads	1
me	1
on,	1
Than	1
mine	1
no	1
lineage	1
is	1
more	1
high,	1
Or	1
older,	1
underneath	1
the	1
sun.	1
To	1
use	1
me	1
rightly	1
few	1
know	1
how,	1
To	1
act	1
without	1
me	1
fewer	1
still,	1
For	1
I	1
am	1
Interest,	1
and	1
I	1
vow	1
For	1
evermore	1
to	1
do	1
thy	1
will.	1
Interest	1
retired,	1
and	1
Poetry	1
came	1
forward,	1
and	1
when	1
she	1
had	1
gone	1
through	1
her	1
figures	1
like	1
the	1
others,	1
fixing	1
her	1
eyes	1
on	1
the	1
damsel	1
of	1
the	1
castle,	1
she	1
said:	1
With	1
many	1
a	1
fanciful	1
conceit,	1
Fair	1
Lady,	1
winsome	1
Poesy	1
Her	1
soul,	1
an	1
offering	1
at	1
thy	1
feet,	1
Presents	1
in	1
sonnets	1
unto	1
thee.	1
If	1
thou	1
my	1
homage	1
wilt	1
not	1
scorn,	1
Thy	1
fortune,	1
watched	1
by	1
envious	1
eyes,	1
On	1
wings	1
of	1
poesy	1
upborne	1
Shall	1
be	1
exalted	1
to	1
the	1
skies.	1
Poetry	1
withdrew,	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
side	1
of	1
Interest	1
Liberality	1
advanced,	1
and	1
after	1
having	1
gone	1
through	1
her	1
figures,	1
said:	1
To	1
give,	1
while	1
shunning	1
each	1
extreme,	1
The	1
sparing	1
hand,	1
the	1
over-free,	1
Therein	1
consists,	1
so	1
wise	1
men	1
deem,	1
The	1
virtue	1
Liberality.	1
But	1
thee,	1
fair	1
lady,	1
to	1
enrich,	1
Myself	1
a	1
prodigal	1
I’ll	1
prove,	1
A	1
vice	1
not	1
wholly	1
shameful,	1
which	1
May	1
find	1
its	1
fair	1
excuse	1
in	1
love.	1
In	1
the	1
same	1
manner	1
all	1
the	1
characters	1
of	1
the	1
two	1
bands	1
advanced	1
and	1
retired,	1
and	1
each	1
executed	1
its	1
figures,	1
and	1
delivered	1
its	1
verses,	1
some	1
of	1
them	1
graceful,	1
some	1
burlesque,	1
but	1
Don	1
Quixote’s	1
memory	1
(though	1
he	1
had	1
an	1
excellent	1
one)	1
only	1
carried	1
away	1
those	1
that	1
have	1
been	1
just	1
quoted.	1
All	1
then	1
mingled	1
together,	1
forming	1
chains	1
and	1
breaking	1
off	1
again	1
with	1
graceful,	1
unconstrained	1
gaiety;	1
and	1
whenever	1
Love	1
passed	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
the	1
castle	1
he	1
shot	1
his	1
arrows	1
up	1
at	1
it,	1
while	1
Interest	1
broke	1
gilded	1
pellets	1
against	1
it.	1
At	1
length,	1
after	1
they	1
had	1
danced	1
a	1
good	1
while,	1
Interest	1
drew	1
out	1
a	1
great	1
purse,	1
made	1
of	1
the	1
skin	1
of	1
a	1
large	1
brindled	1
cat	1
and	1
to	1
all	1
appearance	1
full	1
of	1
money,	1
and	1
flung	1
it	1
at	1
the	1
castle,	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
force	1
of	1
the	1
blow	1
the	1
boards	1
fell	1
asunder	1
and	1
tumbled	1
down,	1
leaving	1
the	1
damsel	1
exposed	1
and	1
unprotected.	1
Interest	1
and	1
the	1
characters	1
of	1
his	1
band	1
advanced,	1
and	1
throwing	1
a	1
great	1
chain	1
of	1
gold	1
over	1
her	1
neck	1
pretended	1
to	1
take	1
her	1
and	1
lead	1
her	1
away	1
captive,	1
on	1
seeing	1
which,	1
Love	1
and	1
his	1
supporters	1
made	1
as	1
though	1
they	1
would	1
release	1
her,	1
the	1
whole	1
action	1
being	1
to	1
the	1
accompaniment	1
of	1
the	1
tabors	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
form	1
of	1
a	1
regular	1
dance.	1
The	1
wild	1
men	1
made	1
peace	1
between	1
them,	1
and	1
with	1
great	1
dexterity	1
readjusted	1
and	1
fixed	1
the	1
boards	1
of	1
the	1
castle,	1
and	1
the	1
damsel	1
once	1
more	1
ensconced	1
herself	1
within;	1
and	1
with	1
this	1
the	1
dance	1
wound	1
up,	1
to	1
the	1
great	1
enjoyment	1
of	1
the	1
beholders.	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
asked	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
nymphs	1
who	1
it	1
was	1
that	1
had	1
composed	1
and	1
arranged	1
it.	1
She	1
replied	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
beneficiary	1
of	1
the	1
town	1
who	1
had	1
a	1
nice	1
taste	1
in	1
devising	1
things	1
of	1
the	1
sort.	1
“I	1
will	1
lay	1
a	1
wager,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“that	1
the	1
same	1
bachelor	1
or	1
beneficiary	1
is	1
a	1
greater	1
friend	1
of	1
Camacho’s	1
than	1
of	1
Basilio’s,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
better	1
at	1
satire	1
than	1
at	1
vespers;	1
he	1
has	1
introduced	1
the	1
accomplishments	1
of	1
Basilio	1
and	1
the	1
riches	1
of	1
Camacho	1
very	1
neatly	1
into	1
the	1
dance.”	1
Sancho	1
Panza,	1
who	1
was	1
listening	1
to	1
all	1
this,	1
exclaimed,	1
“The	1
king	1
is	1
my	1
cock;	1
I	1
stick	1
to	1
Camacho.”	1
“It	1
is	1
easy	1
to	1
see	1
thou	1
art	1
a	1
clown,	1
Sancho,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“and	1
one	1
of	1
that	1
sort	1
that	1
cry	1
‘Long	1
life	1
to	1
the	1
conqueror.’”	1
“I	1
don’t	1
know	1
of	1
what	1
sort	1
I	1
am,”	1
returned	1
Sancho,	1
“but	1
I	1
know	1
very	1
well	1
I’ll	1
never	1
get	1
such	1
elegant	1
skimmings	1
off	1
Basilio’s	1
pots	1
as	1
these	1
I	1
have	1
got	1
off	1
Camacho’s;”	1
and	1
he	1
showed	1
him	1
the	1
bucketful	1
of	1
geese	1
and	1
hens,	1
and	1
seizing	1
one	1
began	1
to	1
eat	1
with	1
great	1
gaiety	1
and	1
appetite,	1
saying,	1
“A	1
fig	1
for	1
the	1
accomplishments	1
of	1
Basilio!	1
As	1
much	1
as	1
thou	1
hast	1
so	1
much	1
art	1
thou	1
worth,	1
and	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
thou	1
art	1
worth	1
so	1
much	1
hast	1
thou.	1
As	1
a	1
grandmother	1
of	1
mine	1
used	1
to	1
say,	1
there	1
are	1
only	1
two	1
families	1
in	1
the	1
world,	1
the	1
Haves	1
and	1
the	1
Haven’ts;	1
and	1
she	1
stuck	1
to	1
the	1
Haves;	1
and	1
to	1
this	1
day,	1
Señor	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
people	1
would	1
sooner	1
feel	1
the	1
pulse	1
of	1
‘Have,’	1
than	1
of	1
‘Know;’	1
an	1
ass	1
covered	1
with	1
gold	1
looks	1
better	1
than	1
a	1
horse	1
with	1
a	1
pack-saddle.	1
So	1
once	1
more	1
I	1
say	1
I	1
stick	1
to	1
Camacho,	1
the	1
bountiful	1
skimmings	1
of	1
whose	1
pots	1
are	1
geese	1
and	1
hens,	1
hares	1
and	1
rabbits;	1
but	1
of	1
Basilio’s,	1
if	1
any	1
ever	1
come	1
to	1
hand,	1
or	1
even	1
to	1
foot,	1
they’ll	1
be	1
only	1
rinsings.”	1
“Hast	1
thou	1
finished	1
thy	1
harangue,	1
Sancho?”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote.	1
“Of	1
course	1
I	1
have	1
finished	1
it,”	1
replied	1
Sancho,	1
“because	1
I	1
see	1
your	1
worship	1
takes	1
offence	1
at	1
it;	1
but	1
if	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
for	1
that,	1
there	1
was	1
work	1
enough	1
cut	1
out	1
for	1
three	1
days.”	1
“God	1
grant	1
I	1
may	1
see	1
thee	1
dumb	1
before	1
I	1
die,	1
Sancho,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote.	1
“At	1
the	1
rate	1
we	1
are	1
going,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“I’ll	1
be	1
chewing	1
clay	1
before	1
your	1
worship	1
dies;	1
and	1
then,	1
maybe,	1
I’ll	1
be	1
so	1
dumb	1
that	1
I’ll	1
not	1
say	1
a	1
word	1
until	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
world,	1
or,	1
at	1
least,	1
till	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
judgment.”	1
“Even	1
should	1
that	1
happen,	1
O	1
Sancho,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“thy	1
silence	1
will	1
never	1
come	1
up	1
to	1
all	1
thou	1
hast	1
talked,	1
art	1
talking,	1
and	1
wilt	1
talk	1
all	1
thy	1
life;	1
moreover,	1
it	1
naturally	1
stands	1
to	1
reason,	1
that	1
my	1
death	1
will	1
come	1
before	1
thine;	1
so	1
I	1
never	1
expect	1
to	1
see	1
thee	1
dumb,	1
not	1
even	1
when	1
thou	1
art	1
drinking	1
or	1
sleeping,	1
and	1
that	1
is	1
the	1
utmost	1
I	1
can	1
say.”	1
“In	1
good	1
faith,	1
señor,”	1
replied	1
Sancho,	1
“there’s	1
no	1
trusting	1
that	1
fleshless	1
one,	1
I	1
mean	1
Death,	1
who	1
devours	1
the	1
lamb	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
the	1
sheep,	1
and,	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
heard	1
our	1
curate	1
say,	1
treads	1
with	1
equal	1
foot	1
upon	1
the	1
lofty	1
towers	1
of	1
kings	1
and	1
the	1
lowly	1
huts	1
of	1
the	1
poor.	1
That	1
lady	1
is	1
more	1
mighty	1
than	1
dainty,	1
she	1
is	1
in	1
no	1
way	1
squeamish,	1
she	1
devours	1
all	1
and	1
is	1
ready	1
for	1
all,	1
and	1
fills	1
her	1
alforjas	1
with	1
people	1
of	1
all	1
sorts,	1
ages,	1
and	1
ranks.	1
She	1
is	1
no	1
reaper	1
that	1
sleeps	1
out	1
the	1
noontide;	1
at	1
all	1
times	1
she	1
is	1
reaping	1
and	1
cutting	1
down,	1
as	1
well	1
the	1
dry	1
grass	1
as	1
the	1
green;	1
she	1
never	1
seems	1
to	1
chew,	1
but	1
bolts	1
and	1
swallows	1
all	1
that	1
is	1
put	1
before	1
her,	1
for	1
she	1
has	1
a	1
canine	1
appetite	1
that	1
is	1
never	1
satisfied;	1
and	1
though	1
she	1
has	1
no	1
belly,	1
she	1
shows	1
she	1
has	1
a	1
dropsy	1
and	1
is	1
athirst	1
to	1
drink	1
the	1
lives	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
live,	1
as	1
one	1
would	1
drink	1
a	1
jug	1
of	1
cold	1
water.”	1
“Say	1
no	1
more,	1
Sancho,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
at	1
this;	1
“don’t	1
try	1
to	1
better	1
it,	1
and	1
risk	1
a	1
fall;	1
for	1
in	1
truth	1
what	1
thou	1
hast	1
said	1
about	1
death	1
in	1
thy	1
rustic	1
phrase	1
is	1
what	1
a	1
good	1
preacher	1
might	1
have	1
said.	1
I	1
tell	1
thee,	1
Sancho,	1
if	1
thou	1
hadst	1
discretion	1
equal	1
to	1
thy	1
mother	1
wit,	1
thou	1
mightst	1
take	1
a	1
pulpit	1
in	1
hand,	1
and	1
go	1
about	1
the	1
world	1
preaching	1
fine	1
sermons.”	1
“He	1
preaches	1
well	1
who	1
lives	1
well,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“and	1
I	1
know	1
no	1
more	1
theology	1
than	1
that.”	1
“Nor	1
needst	1
thou,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“but	1
I	1
cannot	1
conceive	1
or	1
make	1
out	1
how	1
it	1
is	1
that,	1
the	1
fear	1
of	1
God	1
being	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
wisdom,	1
thou,	1
who	1
art	1
more	1
afraid	1
of	1
a	1
lizard	1
than	1
of	1
him,	1
knowest	1
so	1
much.”	1
“Pass	1
judgment	1
on	1
your	1
chivalries,	1
señor,”	1
returned	1
Sancho,	1
“and	1
don’t	1
set	1
yourself	1
up	1
to	1
judge	1
of	1
other	1
men’s	1
fears	1
or	1
braveries,	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
as	1
good	1
a	1
fearer	1
of	1
God	1
as	1
my	1
neighbours;	1
but	1
leave	1
me	1
to	1
despatch	1
these	1
skimmings,	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
rest	1
is	1
only	1
idle	1
talk	1
that	1
we	1
shall	1
be	1
called	1
to	1
account	1
for	1
in	1
the	1
other	1
world;”	1
and	1
so	1
saying,	1
he	1
began	1
a	1
fresh	1
attack	1
on	1
the	1
bucket,	1
with	1
such	1
a	1
hearty	1
appetite	1
that	1
he	1
aroused	1
Don	1
Quixote’s,	1
who	1
no	1
doubt	1
would	1
have	1
helped	1
him	1
had	1
he	1
not	1
been	1
prevented	1
by	1
what	1
must	1
be	1
told	1
farther	1
on.	1

While	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
and	1
Sancho	1
were	1
engaged	1
in	1
the	1
discussion	1
set	1
forth	1
the	1
last	1
chapter,	1
they	1
heard	1
loud	1
shouts	1
and	1
a	1
great	1
noise,	1
which	1
were	1
uttered	1
and	1
made	1
by	1
the	1
men	1
on	1
the	1
mares	1
as	1
they	1
went	1
at	1
full	1
gallop,	1
shouting,	1
to	1
receive	1
the	1
bride	1
and	1
bridegroom,	1
who	1
were	1
approaching	1
with	1
musical	1
instruments	1
and	1
pageantry	1
of	1
all	1
sorts	1
around	1
them,	1
and	1
accompanied	1
by	1
the	1
priest	1
and	1
the	1
relatives	1
of	1
both,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
most	1
distinguished	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
surrounding	1
villages.	1
When	1
Sancho	1
saw	1
the	1
bride,	1
he	1
exclaimed,	1
“By	1
my	1
faith,	1
she	1
is	1
not	1
dressed	1
like	1
a	1
country	1
girl,	1
but	1
like	1
some	1
fine	1
court	1
lady;	1
egad,	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
I	1
can	1
make	1
out,	1
the	1
patena	1
she	1
wears	1
rich	1
coral,	1
and	1
her	1
green	1
Cuenca	1
stuff	1
is	1
thirty-pile	1
velvet;	1
and	1
then	1
the	1
white	1
linen	1
trimming—by	1
my	1
oath,	1
but	1
it’s	1
satin!	1
Look	1
at	1
her	1
hands—jet	1
rings	1
on	1
them!	1
May	1
I	1
never	1
have	1
luck	1
if	1
they’re	1
not	1
gold	1
rings,	1
and	1
real	1
gold,	1
and	1
set	1
with	1
pearls	1
as	1
white	1
as	1
a	1
curdled	1
milk,	1
and	1
every	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
worth	1
an	1
eye	1
of	1
one’s	1
head!	1
Whoreson	1
baggage,	1
what	1
hair	1
she	1
has!	1
if	1
it’s	1
not	1
a	1
wig,	1
I	1
never	1
saw	1
longer	1
or	1
fairer	1
all	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
my	1
life.	1
See	1
how	1
bravely	1
she	1
bears	1
herself—and	1
her	1
shape!	1
Wouldn’t	1
you	1
say	1
she	1
was	1
like	1
a	1
walking	1
palm	1
tree	1
loaded	1
with	1
clusters	1
of	1
dates?	1
for	1
the	1
trinkets	1
she	1
has	1
hanging	1
from	1
her	1
hair	1
and	1
neck	1
look	1
just	1
like	1
them.	1
I	1
swear	1
in	1
my	1
heart	1
she	1
is	1
a	1
brave	1
lass,	1
and	1
fit	1
‘to	1
pass	1
over	1
the	1
banks	1
of	1
Flanders.’”	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
laughed	1
at	1
Sancho’s	1
boorish	1
eulogies	1
and	1
thought	1
that,	1
saving	1
his	1
lady	1
Dulcinea	1
del	1
Toboso,	1
he	1
had	1
never	1
seen	1
a	1
more	1
beautiful	1
woman.	1
The	1
fair	1
Quiteria	1
appeared	1
somewhat	1
pale,	1
which	1
was,	1
no	1
doubt,	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
bad	1
night	1
brides	1
always	1
pass	1
dressing	1
themselves	1
out	1
for	1
their	1
wedding	1
on	1
the	1
morrow.	1
They	1
advanced	1
towards	1
a	1
theatre	1
that	1
stood	1
on	1
one	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
meadow	1
decked	1
with	1
carpets	1
and	1
boughs,	1
where	1
they	1
were	1
to	1
plight	1
their	1
troth,	1
and	1
from	1
which	1
they	1
were	1
to	1
behold	1
the	1
dances	1
and	1
plays;	1
but	1
at	1
the	1
moment	1
of	1
their	1
arrival	1
at	1
the	1
spot	1
they	1
heard	1
a	1
loud	1
outcry	1
behind	1
them,	1
and	1
a	1
voice	1
exclaiming,	1
“Wait	1
a	1
little,	1
ye,	1
as	1
inconsiderate	1
as	1
ye	1
are	1
hasty!”	1
At	1
these	1
words	1
all	1
turned	1
round,	1
and	1
perceived	1
that	1
the	1
speaker	1
was	1
a	1
man	1
clad	1
in	1
what	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
loose	1
black	1
coat	1
garnished	1
with	1
crimson	1
patches	1
like	1
flames.	1
He	1
was	1
crowned	1
(as	1
was	1
presently	1
seen)	1
with	1
a	1
crown	1
of	1
gloomy	1
cypress,	1
and	1
in	1
his	1
hand	1
he	1
held	1
a	1
long	1
staff.	1
As	1
he	1
approached	1
he	1
was	1
recognised	1
by	1
everyone	1
as	1
the	1
gay	1
Basilio,	1
and	1
all	1
waited	1
anxiously	1
to	1
see	1
what	1
would	1
come	1
of	1
his	1
words,	1
in	1
dread	1
of	1
some	1
catastrophe	1
in	1
consequence	1
of	1
his	1
appearance	1
at	1
such	1
a	1
moment.	1
He	1
came	1
up	1
at	1
last	1
weary	1
and	1
breathless,	1
and	1
planting	1
himself	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
the	1
bridal	1
pair,	1
drove	1
his	1
staff,	1
which	1
had	1
a	1
steel	1
spike	1
at	1
the	1
end,	1
into	1
the	1
ground,	1
and,	1
with	1
a	1
pale	1
face	1
and	1
eyes	1
fixed	1
on	1
Quiteria,	1
he	1
thus	1
addressed	1
her	1
in	1
a	1
hoarse,	1
trembling	1
voice:	1
“Well	1
dost	1
thou	1
know,	1
ungrateful	1
Quiteria,	1
that	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
holy	1
law	1
we	1
acknowledge,	1
so	1
long	1
as	1
live	1
thou	1
canst	1
take	1
no	1
husband;	1
nor	1
art	1
thou	1
ignorant	1
either	1
that,	1
in	1
my	1
hopes	1
that	1
time	1
and	1
my	1
own	1
exertions	1
would	1
improve	1
my	1
fortunes,	1
I	1
have	1
never	1
failed	1
to	1
observe	1
the	1
respect	1
due	1
to	1
thy	1
honour;	1
but	1
thou,	1
casting	1
behind	1
thee	1
all	1
thou	1
owest	1
to	1
my	1
true	1
love,	1
wouldst	1
surrender	1
what	1
is	1
mine	1
to	1
another	1
whose	1
wealth	1
serves	1
to	1
bring	1
him	1
not	1
only	1
good	1
fortune	1
but	1
supreme	1
happiness;	1
and	1
now	1
to	1
complete	1
it	1
(not	1
that	1
I	1
think	1
he	1
deserves	1
it,	1
but	1
inasmuch	1
as	1
heaven	1
is	1
pleased	1
to	1
bestow	1
it	1
upon	1
him),	1
I	1
will,	1
with	1
my	1
own	1
hands,	1
do	1
away	1
with	1
the	1
obstacle	1
that	1
may	1
interfere	1
with	1
it,	1
and	1
remove	1
myself	1
from	1
between	1
you.	1
Long	1
live	1
the	1
rich	1
Camacho!	1
many	1
a	1
happy	1
year	1
may	1
he	1
live	1
with	1
the	1
ungrateful	1
Quiteria!	1
and	1
let	1
the	1
poor	1
Basilio	1
die,	1
Basilio	1
whose	1
poverty	1
clipped	1
the	1
wings	1
of	1
his	1
happiness,	1
and	1
brought	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
grave!”	1
And	1
so	1
saying,	1
he	1
seized	1
the	1
staff	1
he	1
had	1
driven	1
into	1
the	1
ground,	1
and	1
leaving	1
one	1
half	1
of	1
it	1
fixed	1
there,	1
showed	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
sheath	1
that	1
concealed	1
a	1
tolerably	1
long	1
rapier;	1
and,	1
what	1
may	1
be	1
called	1
its	1
hilt	1
being	1
planted	1
in	1
the	1
ground,	1
he	1
swiftly,	1
coolly,	1
and	1
deliberately	1
threw	1
himself	1
upon	1
it,	1
and	1
in	1
an	1
instant	1
the	1
bloody	1
point	1
and	1
half	1
the	1
steel	1
blade	1
appeared	1
at	1
his	1
back,	1
the	1
unhappy	1
man	1
falling	1
to	1
the	1
earth	1
bathed	1
in	1
his	1
blood,	1
and	1
transfixed	1
by	1
his	1
own	1
weapon.	1
His	1
friends	1
at	1
once	1
ran	1
to	1
his	1
aid,	1
filled	1
with	1
grief	1
at	1
his	1
misery	1
and	1
sad	1
fate,	1
and	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
dismounting	1
from	1
Rocinante,	1
hastened	1
to	1
support	1
him,	1
and	1
took	1
him	1
in	1
his	1
arms,	1
and	1
found	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
yet	1
ceased	1
to	1
breathe.	1
They	1
were	1
about	1
to	1
draw	1
out	1
the	1
rapier,	1
but	1
the	1
priest	1
who	1
was	1
standing	1
by	1
objected	1
to	1
its	1
being	1
withdrawn	1
before	1
he	1
had	1
confessed	1
him,	1
as	1
the	1
instant	1
of	1
its	1
withdrawal	1
would	1
be	1
that	1
of	1
this	1
death.	1
Basilio,	1
however,	1
reviving	1
slightly,	1
said	1
in	1
a	1
weak	1
voice,	1
as	1
though	1
in	1
pain,	1
“If	1
thou	1
wouldst	1
consent,	1
cruel	1
Quiteria,	1
to	1
give	1
me	1
thy	1
hand	1
as	1
my	1
bride	1
in	1
this	1
last	1
fatal	1
moment,	1
I	1
might	1
still	1
hope	1
that	1
my	1
rashness	1
would	1
find	1
pardon,	1
as	1
by	1
its	1
means	1
I	1
attained	1
the	1
bliss	1
of	1
being	1
thine.”	1
Hearing	1
this	1
the	1
priest	1
bade	1
him	1
think	1
of	1
the	1
welfare	1
of	1
his	1
soul	1
rather	1
than	1
of	1
the	1
cravings	1
of	1
the	1
body,	1
and	1
in	1
all	1
earnestness	1
implore	1
God’s	1
pardon	1
for	1
his	1
sins	1
and	1
for	1
his	1
rash	1
resolve;	1
to	1
which	1
Basilio	1
replied	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
determined	1
not	1
to	1
confess	1
unless	1
Quiteria	1
first	1
gave	1
him	1
her	1
hand	1
in	1
marriage,	1
for	1
that	1
happiness	1
would	1
compose	1
his	1
mind	1
and	1
give	1
him	1
courage	1
to	1
make	1
his	1
confession.	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
hearing	1
the	1
wounded	1
man’s	1
entreaty,	1
exclaimed	1
aloud	1
that	1
what	1
Basilio	1
asked	1
was	1
just	1
and	1
reasonable,	1
and	1
moreover	1
a	1
request	1
that	1
might	1
be	1
easily	1
complied	1
with;	1
and	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
as	1
much	1
to	1
Señor	1
Camacho’s	1
honour	1
to	1
receive	1
the	1
lady	1
Quiteria	1
as	1
the	1
widow	1
of	1
the	1
brave	1
Basilio	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
received	1
her	1
direct	1
from	1
her	1
father.	1
“In	1
this	1
case,”	1
said	1
he,	1
“it	1
will	1
be	1
only	1
to	1
say	1
‘yes,’	1
and	1
no	1
consequences	1
can	1
follow	1
the	1
utterance	1
of	1
the	1
word,	1
for	1
the	1
nuptial	1
couch	1
of	1
this	1
marriage	1
must	1
be	1
the	1
grave.”	1
Camacho	1
was	1
listening	1
to	1
all	1
this,	1
perplexed	1
and	1
bewildered	1
and	1
not	1
knowing	1
what	1
to	1
say	1
or	1
do;	1
but	1
so	1
urgent	1
were	1
the	1
entreaties	1
of	1
Basilio’s	1
friends,	1
imploring	1
him	1
to	1
allow	1
Quiteria	1
to	1
give	1
him	1
her	1
hand,	1
so	1
that	1
his	1
soul,	1
quitting	1
this	1
life	1
in	1
despair,	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
lost,	1
that	1
they	1
moved,	1
nay,	1
forced	1
him,	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
if	1
Quiteria	1
were	1
willing	1
to	1
give	1
it	1
he	1
was	1
satisfied,	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
only	1
putting	1
off	1
the	1
fulfillment	1
of	1
his	1
wishes	1
for	1
a	1
moment.	1
At	1
once	1
all	1
assailed	1
Quiteria	1
and	1
pressed	1
her,	1
some	1
with	1
prayers,	1
and	1
others	1
with	1
tears,	1
and	1
others	1
with	1
persuasive	1
arguments,	1
to	1
give	1
her	1
hand	1
to	1
poor	1
Basilio;	1
but	1
she,	1
harder	1
than	1
marble	1
and	1
more	1
unmoved	1
than	1
any	1
statue,	1
seemed	1
unable	1
or	1
unwilling	1
to	1
utter	1
a	1
word,	1
nor	1
would	1
she	1
have	1
given	1
any	1
reply	1
had	1
not	1
the	1
priest	1
bade	1
her	1
decide	1
quickly	1
what	1
she	1
meant	1
to	1
do,	1
as	1
Basilio	1
now	1
had	1
his	1
soul	1
at	1
his	1
teeth,	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
time	1
for	1
hesitation.	1

On	1
this	1
the	1
fair	1
Quiteria,	1
to	1
all	1
appearance	1
distressed,	1
grieved,	1
and	1
repentant,	1
advanced	1
without	1
a	1
word	1
to	1
where	1
Basilio	1
lay,	1
his	1
eyes	1
already	1
turned	1
in	1
his	1
head,	1
his	1
breathing	1
short	1
and	1
painful,	1
murmuring	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Quiteria	1
between	1
his	1
teeth,	1
and	1
apparently	1
about	1
to	1
die	1
like	1
a	1
heathen	1
and	1
not	1
like	1
a	1
Christian.	1
Quiteria	1
approached	1
him,	1
and	1
kneeling,	1
demanded	1
his	1
hand	1
by	1
signs	1
without	1
speaking.	1
Basilio	1
opened	1
his	1
eyes	1
and	1
gazing	1
fixedly	1
at	1
her,	1
said,	1
“O	1
Quiteria,	1
why	1
hast	1
thou	1
turned	1
compassionate	1
at	1
a	1
moment	1
when	1
thy	1
compassion	1
will	1
serve	1
as	1
a	1
dagger	1
to	1
rob	1
me	1
of	1
life,	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
now	1
the	1
strength	1
left	1
either	1
to	1
bear	1
the	1
happiness	1
thou	1
givest	1
me	1
in	1
accepting	1
me	1
as	1
thine,	1
or	1
to	1
suppress	1
the	1
pain	1
that	1
is	1
rapidly	1
drawing	1
the	1
dread	1
shadow	1
of	1
death	1
over	1
my	1
eyes?	1
What	1
I	1
entreat	1
of	1
thee,	1
O	1
thou	1
fatal	1
star	1
to	1
me,	1
is	1
that	1
the	1
hand	1
thou	1
demandest	1
of	1
me	1
and	1
wouldst	1
give	1
me,	1
be	1
not	1
given	1
out	1
of	1
complaisance	1
or	1
to	1
deceive	1
me	1
afresh,	1
but	1
that	1
thou	1
confess	1
and	1
declare	1
that	1
without	1
any	1
constraint	1
upon	1
thy	1
will	1
thou	1
givest	1
it	1
to	1
me	1
as	1
to	1
thy	1
lawful	1
husband;	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
meet	1
that	1
thou	1
shouldst	1
trifle	1
with	1
me	1
at	1
such	1
a	1
moment	1
as	1
this,	1
or	1
have	1
recourse	1
to	1
falsehoods	1
with	1
one	1
who	1
has	1
dealt	1
so	1
truly	1
by	1
thee.”	1
While	1
uttering	1
these	1
words	1
he	1
showed	1
such	1
weakness	1
that	1
the	1
bystanders	1
expected	1
each	1
return	1
of	1
faintness	1
would	1
take	1
his	1
life	1
with	1
it.	1
Then	1
Quiteria,	1
overcome	1
with	1
modesty	1
and	1
shame,	1
holding	1
in	1
her	1
right	1
hand	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
Basilio,	1
said,	1
“No	1
force	1
would	1
bend	1
my	1
will;	1
as	1
freely,	1
therefore,	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
possible	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
do	1
so,	1
I	1
give	1
thee	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
a	1
lawful	1
wife,	1
and	1
take	1
thine	1
if	1
thou	1
givest	1
it	1
to	1
me	1
of	1
thine	1
own	1
free	1
will,	1
untroubled	1
and	1
unaffected	1
by	1
the	1
calamity	1
thy	1
hasty	1
act	1
has	1
brought	1
upon	1
thee.”	1
“Yes,	1
I	1
give	1
it,”	1
said	1
Basilio,	1
“not	1
agitated	1
or	1
distracted,	1
but	1
with	1
unclouded	1
reason	1
that	1
heaven	1
is	1
pleased	1
to	1
grant	1
me,	1
thus	1
do	1
I	1
give	1
myself	1
to	1
be	1
thy	1
husband.”	1
“And	1
I	1
give	1
myself	1
to	1
be	1
thy	1
wife,”	1
said	1
Quiteria,	1
“whether	1
thou	1
livest	1
many	1
years,	1
or	1
they	1
carry	1
thee	1
from	1
my	1
arms	1
to	1
the	1
grave.”	1
“For	1
one	1
so	1
badly	1
wounded,”	1
observed	1
Sancho	1
at	1
this	1
point,	1
“this	1
young	1
man	1
has	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
to	1
say;	1
they	1
should	1
make	1
him	1
leave	1
off	1
billing	1
and	1
cooing,	1
and	1
attend	1
to	1
his	1
soul;	1
for	1
to	1
my	1
thinking	1
he	1
has	1
it	1
more	1
on	1
his	1
tongue	1
than	1
at	1
his	1
teeth.”	1
Basilio	1
and	1
Quiteria	1
having	1
thus	1
joined	1
hands,	1
the	1
priest,	1
deeply	1
moved	1
and	1
with	1
tears	1
in	1
his	1
eyes,	1
pronounced	1
the	1
blessing	1
upon	1
them,	1
and	1
implored	1
heaven	1
to	1
grant	1
an	1
easy	1
passage	1
to	1
the	1
soul	1
of	1
the	1
newly	1
wedded	1
man,	1
who,	1
the	1
instant	1
he	1
received	1
the	1
blessing,	1
started	1
nimbly	1
to	1
his	1
feet	1
and	1
with	1
unparalleled	1
effrontery	1
pulled	1
out	1
the	1
rapier	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
sheathed	1
in	1
his	1
body.	1
All	1
the	1
bystanders	1
were	1
astounded,	1
and	1
some,	1
more	1
simple	1
than	1
inquiring,	1
began	1
shouting,	1
“A	1
miracle,	1
a	1
miracle!”	1
But	1
Basilio	1
replied,	1
“No	1
miracle,	1
no	1
miracle;	1
only	1
a	1
trick,	1
a	1
trick!”	1
The	1
priest,	1
perplexed	1
and	1
amazed,	1
made	1
haste	1
to	1
examine	1
the	1
wound	1
with	1
both	1
hands,	1
and	1
found	1
that	1
the	1
blade	1
had	1
passed,	1
not	1
through	1
Basilio’s	1
flesh	1
and	1
ribs,	1
but	1
through	1
a	1
hollow	1
iron	1
tube	1
full	1
of	1
blood,	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
adroitly	1
fixed	1
at	1
the	1
place,	1
the	1
blood,	1
as	1
was	1
afterwards	1
ascertained,	1
having	1
been	1
so	1
prepared	1
as	1
not	1
to	1
congeal.	1
In	1
short,	1
the	1
priest	1
and	1
Camacho	1
and	1
most	1
of	1
those	1
present	1
saw	1
they	1
were	1
tricked	1
and	1
made	1
fools	1
of.	1
The	1
bride	1
showed	1
no	1
signs	1
of	1
displeasure	1
at	1
the	1
deception;	1
on	1
the	1
contrary,	1
hearing	1
them	1
say	1
that	1
the	1
marriage,	1
being	1
fraudulent,	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
valid,	1
she	1
said	1
that	1
she	1
confirmed	1
it	1
afresh,	1
whence	1
they	1
all	1
concluded	1
that	1
the	1
affair	1
had	1
been	1
planned	1
by	1
agreement	1
and	1
understanding	1
between	1
the	1
pair,	1
whereat	1
Camacho	1
and	1
his	1
supporters	1
were	1
so	1
mortified	1
that	1
they	1
proceeded	1
to	1
revenge	1
themselves	1
by	1
violence,	1
and	1
a	1
great	1
number	1
of	1
them	1
drawing	1
their	1
swords	1
attacked	1
Basilio,	1
in	1
whose	1
protection	1
as	1
many	1
more	1
swords	1
were	1
in	1
an	1
instant	1
unsheathed,	1
while	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
taking	1
the	1
lead	1
on	1
horseback,	1
with	1
his	1
lance	1
over	1
his	1
arm	1
and	1
well	1
covered	1
with	1
his	1
shield,	1
made	1
all	1
give	1
way	1
before	1
him.	1
Sancho,	1
who	1
never	1
found	1
any	1
pleasure	1
or	1
enjoyment	1
in	1
such	1
doings,	1
retreated	1
to	1
the	1
wine-jars	1
from	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
taken	1
his	1
delectable	1
skimmings,	1
considering	1
that,	1
as	1
a	1
holy	1
place,	1
that	1
spot	1
would	1
be	1
respected.	1
“Hold,	1
sirs,	1
hold!”	1
cried	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
in	1
a	1
loud	1
voice;	1
“we	1
have	1
no	1
right	1
to	1
take	1
vengeance	1
for	1
wrongs	1
that	1
love	1
may	1
do	1
to	1
us:	1
remember	1
love	1
and	1
war	1
are	1
the	1
same	1
thing,	1
and	1
as	1
in	1
war	1
it	1
is	1
allowable	1
and	1
common	1
to	1
make	1
use	1
of	1
wiles	1
and	1
stratagems	1
to	1
overcome	1
the	1
enemy,	1
so	1
in	1
the	1
contests	1
and	1
rivalries	1
of	1
love	1
the	1
tricks	1
and	1
devices	1
employed	1
to	1
attain	1
the	1
desired	1
end	1
are	1
justifiable,	1
provided	1
they	1
be	1
not	1
to	1
the	1
discredit	1
or	1
dishonour	1
of	1
the	1
loved	1
object.	1
Quiteria	1
belonged	1
to	1
Basilio	1
and	1
Basilio	1
to	1
Quiteria	1
by	1
the	1
just	1
and	1
beneficent	1
disposal	1
of	1
heaven.	1
Camacho	1
is	1
rich,	1
and	1
can	1
purchase	1
his	1
pleasure	1
when,	1
where,	1
and	1
as	1
it	1
pleases	1
him.	1
Basilio	1
has	1
but	1
this	1
ewe-lamb,	1
and	1
no	1
one,	1
however	1
powerful	1
he	1
may	1
be,	1
shall	1
take	1
her	1
from	1
him;	1
these	1
two	1
whom	1
God	1
hath	1
joined	1
man	1
cannot	1
separate;	1
and	1
he	1
who	1
attempts	1
it	1
must	1
first	1
pass	1
the	1
point	1
of	1
this	1
lance;”	1
and	1
so	1
saying	1
he	1
brandished	1
it	1
so	1
stoutly	1
and	1
dexterously	1
that	1
he	1
overawed	1
all	1
who	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
him.	1
But	1
so	1
deep	1
an	1
impression	1
had	1
the	1
rejection	1
of	1
Quiteria	1
made	1
on	1
Camacho’s	1
mind	1
that	1
it	1
banished	1
her	1
at	1
once	1
from	1
his	1
thoughts;	1
and	1
so	1
the	1
counsels	1
of	1
the	1
priest,	1
who	1
was	1
a	1
wise	1
and	1
kindly	1
disposed	1
man,	1
prevailed	1
with	1
him,	1
and	1
by	1
their	1
means	1
he	1
and	1
his	1
partisans	1
were	1
pacified	1
and	1
tranquillised,	1
and	1
to	1
prove	1
it	1
put	1
up	1
their	1
swords	1
again,	1
inveighing	1
against	1
the	1
pliancy	1
of	1
Quiteria	1
rather	1
than	1
the	1
craftiness	1
of	1
Basilio;	1
Camacho	1
maintaining	1
that,	1
if	1
Quiteria	1
as	1
a	1
maiden	1
had	1
such	1
a	1
love	1
for	1
Basilio,	1
she	1
would	1
have	1
loved	1
him	1
too	1
as	1
a	1
married	1
woman,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
ought	1
to	1
thank	1
heaven	1
more	1
for	1
having	1
taken	1
her	1
than	1
for	1
having	1
given	1
her.	1
Camacho	1
and	1
those	1
of	1
his	1
following,	1
therefore,	1
being	1
consoled	1
and	1
pacified,	1
those	1
on	1
Basilio’s	1
side	1
were	1
appeased;	1
and	1
the	1
rich	1
Camacho,	1
to	1
show	1
that	1
he	1
felt	1
no	1
resentment	1
for	1
the	1
trick,	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
care	1
about	1
it,	1
desired	1
the	1
festival	1
to	1
go	1
on	1
just	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
were	1
married	1
in	1
reality.	1
Neither	1
Basilio,	1
however,	1
nor	1
his	1
bride,	1
nor	1
their	1
followers	1
would	1
take	1
any	1
part	1
in	1
it,	1
and	1
they	1
withdrew	1
to	1
Basilio’s	1
village;	1
for	1
the	1
poor,	1
if	1
they	1
are	1
persons	1
of	1
virtue	1
and	1
good	1
sense,	1
have	1
those	1
who	1
follow,	1
honour,	1
and	1
uphold	1
them,	1
just	1
as	1
the	1
rich	1
have	1
those	1
who	1
flatter	1
and	1
dance	1
attendance	1
on	1
them.	1
With	1
them	1
they	1
carried	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
regarding	1
him	1
as	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
worth	1
and	1
a	1
stout	1
one.	1
Sancho	1
alone	1
had	1
a	1
cloud	1
on	1
his	1
soul,	1
for	1
he	1
found	1
himself	1
debarred	1
from	1
waiting	1
for	1
Camacho’s	1
splendid	1
feast	1
and	1
festival,	1
which	1
lasted	1
until	1
night;	1
and	1
thus	1
dragged	1
away,	1
he	1
moodily	1
followed	1
his	1
master,	1
who	1
accompanied	1
Basilio’s	1
party,	1
and	1
left	1
behind	1
him	1
the	1
flesh-pots	1
of	1
Egypt;	1
though	1
in	1
his	1
heart	1
he	1
took	1
them	1
with	1
him,	1
and	1
their	1
now	1
nearly	1
finished	1
skimmings	1
that	1
he	1
carried	1
in	1
the	1
bucket	1
conjured	1
up	1
visions	1
before	1
his	1
eyes	1
of	1
the	1
glory	1
and	1
abundance	1
of	1
the	1
good	1
cheer	1
he	1
was	1
losing.	1
And	1
so,	1
vexed	1
and	1
dejected	1
though	1
not	1
hungry,	1
without	1
dismounting	1
from	1
Dapple	1
he	1
followed	1
in	1
the	1
footsteps	1
of	1
Rocinante.	1

Many	1

great	1
were	1
the	1
attentions	1
shown	1
to	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
by	1
the	1
newly	1
married	1
couple,	1
who	1
felt	1
themselves	1
under	1
an	1
obligation	1
to	1
him	1
for	1
coming	1
forward	1
in	1
defence	1
of	1
their	1
cause;	1
and	1
they	1
exalted	1
his	1
wisdom	1
to	1
the	1
same	1
level	1
with	1
his	1
courage,	1
rating	1
him	1
as	1
a	1
Cid	1
in	1
arms,	1
and	1
a	1
Cicero	1
in	1
eloquence.	1
Worthy	1
Sancho	1
enjoyed	1
himself	1
for	1
three	1
days	1
at	1
the	1
expense	1
of	1
the	1
pair,	1
from	1
whom	1

the	1
sham	1

was	1
not	1
a	1
scheme	1
arranged	1
with	1
the	1
fair	1
Quiteria,	1
but	1
a	1
device	1
of	1
Basilio’s,	1
who	1
counted	1
on	1
exactly	1
the	1
result	1
they	1
had	1
seen;	1
he	1
confessed,	1
it	1
is	1
true,	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
confided	1
his	1
idea	1
to	1
some	1
of	1
his	1
friends,	1
so	1
that	1
at	1
the	1
proper	1
time	1
they	1
might	1
aid	1
him	1
in	1
his	1
purpose	1
and	1
insure	1
the	1
success	1
of	1
the	1
deception.	1

“That,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“is	1
not	1
and	1
ought	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
called	1
deception	1
which	1
aims	1
at	1
virtuous	1
ends;”	1
and	1
the	1
marriage	1
of	1
lovers	1
he	1
maintained	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
most	1
excellent	1
end,	1
reminding	1
them,	1
however,	1
that	1
love	1
has	1
no	1
greater	1
enemy	1
than	1
hunger	1
and	1
constant	1
want;	1
for	1
love	1
is	1
all	1
gaiety,	1
enjoyment,	1
and	1
happiness,	1
especially	1
when	1
the	1
lover	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
possession	1
of	1
the	1
object	1
of	1
his	1
love,	1
and	1
poverty	1
and	1
want	1
are	1
the	1
declared	1
enemies	1
of	1
all	1
these;	1
which	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
urge	1
Señor	1
Basilio	1
to	1
abandon	1
the	1
practice	1
of	1
those	1
accomplishments	1
he	1
was	1
skilled	1
in,	1
for	1
though	1
they	1
brought	1
him	1
fame,	1
they	1
brought	1
him	1
no	1
money,	1
and	1
apply	1
himself	1
to	1
the	1
acquisition	1
of	1
wealth	1
by	1
legitimate	1
industry,	1
which	1
will	1
never	1
fail	1
those	1
who	1
are	1
prudent	1
and	1
persevering.	1
The	1
poor	1
man	1
who	1
is	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
honour	1
(if	1
indeed	1
a	1
poor	1
man	1
can	1
be	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
honour)	1
has	1
a	1
jewel	1
when	1
he	1
has	1
a	1
fair	1
wife,	1
and	1
if	1
she	1
is	1
taken	1
from	1
him,	1
his	1
honour	1
is	1
taken	1
from	1
him	1
and	1
slain.	1
The	1
fair	1
woman	1
who	1
is	1
a	1
woman	1
of	1
honour,	1
and	1
whose	1
husband	1
is	1
poor,	1
deserves	1
to	1
be	1
crowned	1
with	1
the	1
laurels	1
and	1
crowns	1
of	1
victory	1
and	1
triumph.	1
Beauty	1
by	1
itself	1
attracts	1
the	1
desires	1
of	1
all	1
who	1
behold	1
it,	1
and	1
the	1
royal	1
eagles	1
and	1
birds	1
of	1
towering	1
flight	1
stoop	1
on	1
it	1
as	1
on	1
a	1
dainty	1
lure;	1
but	1
if	1
beauty	1
be	1
accompanied	1
by	1
want	1
and	1
penury,	1
then	1
the	1
ravens	1
and	1
the	1
kites	1
and	1
other	1
birds	1
of	1
prey	1
assail	1
it,	1
and	1
she	1
who	1
stands	1
firm	1
against	1
such	1
attacks	1
well	1
deserves	1
to	1
be	1
called	1
the	1
crown	1
of	1
her	1
husband.	1
“Remember,	1
O	1
prudent	1
Basilio,”	1
added	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“it	1
was	1
the	1
opinion	1
of	1
a	1
certain	1
sage,	1
I	1
know	1
not	1
whom,	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
not	1
more	1
than	1
one	1
good	1
woman	1
in	1
the	1
whole	1
world;	1
and	1
his	1
advice	1
was	1
that	1
each	1
one	1
should	1
think	1
and	1
believe	1
that	1
this	1
one	1
good	1
woman	1
was	1
his	1
own	1
wife,	1
and	1
in	1
this	1
way	1
he	1
would	1
live	1
happy.	1
I	1
myself	1
am	1
not	1
married,	1
nor,	1
so	1
far,	1
has	1
it	1
ever	1
entered	1
my	1
thoughts	1
to	1
be	1
so;	1
nevertheless	1
I	1
would	1
venture	1
to	1
give	1
advice	1
to	1
anyone	1
who	1
might	1
ask	1
it,	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
mode	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
should	1
seek	1
a	1
wife	1
such	1
as	1
he	1
would	1
be	1
content	1
to	1
marry.	1
The	1
first	1
thing	1
I	1
would	1
recommend	1
him,	1
would	1
be	1
to	1
look	1
to	1
good	1
name	1
rather	1
than	1
to	1
wealth,	1
for	1
a	1
good	1
woman	1
does	1
not	1
win	1
a	1
good	1
name	1
merely	1
by	1
being	1
good,	1
but	1
by	1
letting	1
it	1
be	1
seen	1
that	1
she	1
is	1
so,	1
and	1
open	1
looseness	1
and	1
freedom	1
do	1
much	1
more	1
damage	1
to	1
a	1
woman’s	1
honour	1
than	1
secret	1
depravity.	1
If	1
you	1
take	1
a	1
good	1
woman	1
into	1
your	1
house	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
an	1
easy	1
matter	1
to	1
keep	1
her	1
good,	1
and	1
even	1
to	1
make	1
her	1
still	1
better;	1
but	1
if	1
you	1
take	1
a	1
bad	1
one	1
you	1
will	1
find	1
it	1
hard	1
work	1
to	1
mend	1
her,	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
no	1
very	1
easy	1
matter	1
to	1
pass	1
from	1
one	1
extreme	1
to	1
another.	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
say	1
it	1
is	1
impossible,	1
but	1
I	1
look	1
upon	1
it	1
as	1
difficult.”	1
Sancho,	1
listening	1
to	1
all	1
this,	1
said	1
to	1
himself,	1
“This	1
master	1
of	1
mine,	1
when	1
I	1
say	1
anything	1
that	1
has	1
weight	1
and	1
substance,	1
says	1
I	1
might	1
take	1
a	1
pulpit	1
in	1
hand,	1
and	1
go	1
about	1
the	1
world	1
preaching	1
fine	1
sermons;	1
but	1
I	1
say	1
of	1
him	1
that,	1
when	1
he	1
begins	1
stringing	1
maxims	1
together	1
and	1
giving	1
advice	1
not	1
only	1
might	1
he	1
take	1
a	1
pulpit	1
in	1
hand,	1
but	1
two	1
on	1
each	1
finger,	1
and	1
go	1
into	1
the	1
market-places	1
to	1
his	1
heart’s	1
content.	1
Devil	1
take	1
you	1
for	1
a	1
knight-errant,	1
what	1
a	1
lot	1
of	1
things	1
you	1
know!	1
I	1
used	1
to	1
think	1
in	1
my	1
heart	1
that	1
the	1
only	1
thing	1
he	1
knew	1
was	1
what	1
belonged	1
to	1
his	1
chivalry;	1
but	1
there	1
is	1
nothing	1
he	1
won’t	1
have	1
a	1
finger	1
in.”	1
Sancho	1
muttered	1
this	1
somewhat	1
aloud,	1
and	1
his	1
master	1
overheard	1
him,	1
and	1
asked,	1
“What	1
art	1
thou	1
muttering	1
there,	1
Sancho?”	1
“I’m	1
not	1
saying	1
anything	1
or	1
muttering	1
anything,”	1
said	1
Sancho;	1
“I	1
was	1
only	1
saying	1
to	1
myself	1
that	1
I	1
wish	1
I	1
had	1
heard	1
what	1
your	1
worship	1
has	1
said	1
just	1
now	1
before	1
I	1
married;	1
perhaps	1
I’d	1
say	1
now,	1
‘The	1
ox	1
that’s	1
loose	1
licks	1
himself	1
well.’”	1
“Is	1
thy	1
Teresa	1
so	1
bad	1
then,	1
Sancho?”	1
“She	1
is	1
not	1
very	1
bad,”	1
replied	1
Sancho;	1
“but	1
she	1
is	1
not	1
very	1
good;	1
at	1
least	1
she	1
is	1
not	1
as	1
good	1
as	1
I	1
could	1
wish.”	1
“Thou	1
dost	1
wrong,	1
Sancho,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“to	1
speak	1
ill	1
of	1
thy	1
wife;	1
for	1
after	1
all	1
she	1
is	1
the	1
mother	1
of	1
thy	1
children.”	1
“We	1
are	1
quits,”	1
returned	1
Sancho;	1
“for	1
she	1
speaks	1
ill	1
of	1
me	1
whenever	1
she	1
takes	1
it	1
into	1
her	1
head,	1
especially	1
when	1
she	1
is	1
jealous;	1
and	1
Satan	1
himself	1
could	1
not	1
put	1
up	1
with	1
her	1
then.”	1
In	1
fine,	1
they	1
remained	1
three	1
days	1
with	1
the	1
newly	1
married	1
couple,	1
by	1
whom	1
they	1
were	1
entertained	1
and	1
treated	1
like	1
kings.	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
begged	1
the	1
fencing	1
licentiate	1
to	1
find	1
him	1
a	1
guide	1
to	1
show	1
him	1
the	1
way	1
to	1
the	1
cave	1
of	1
Montesinos,	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
a	1
great	1
desire	1
to	1
enter	1
it	1
and	1
see	1
with	1
his	1
own	1
eyes	1
if	1
the	1
wonderful	1
tales	1
that	1
were	1
told	1
of	1
it	1
all	1
over	1
the	1
country	1
were	1
true.	1
The	1
licentiate	1
said	1
he	1
would	1
get	1
him	1
a	1
cousin	1
of	1
his	1
own,	1
a	1
famous	1
scholar,	1
and	1
one	1
very	1
much	1
given	1
to	1
reading	1
books	1
of	1
chivalry,	1
who	1
would	1
have	1
great	1
pleasure	1
in	1
conducting	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
the	1
very	1
cave,	1
and	1
would	1
show	1
him	1
the	1
lakes	1
of	1
Ruidera,	1
which	1
were	1
likewise	1
famous	1
all	1
over	1
La	1
Mancha,	1
and	1
even	1
all	1
over	1
Spain;	1
and	1
he	1
assured	1
him	1
he	1
would	1
find	1
him	1
entertaining,	1
for	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
youth	1
who	1
could	1
write	1
books	1
good	1
enough	1
to	1
be	1
printed	1
and	1
dedicated	1
to	1
princes.	1
The	1
cousin	1
arrived	1
at	1
last,	1
leading	1
an	1
ass	1
in	1
foal,	1
with	1
a	1
pack-saddle	1
covered	1
with	1
a	1
parti-coloured	1
carpet	1
or	1
sackcloth;	1
Sancho	1
saddled	1
Rocinante,	1
got	1
Dapple	1
ready,	1
and	1
stocked	1
his	1
alforjas,	1
along	1
with	1
which	1
went	1
those	1
of	1
the	1
cousin,	1
likewise	1
well	1
filled;	1
and	1
so,	1
commending	1
themselves	1
to	1
God	1
and	1
bidding	1
farewell	1
to	1
all,	1
they	1
set	1
out,	1
taking	1
the	1
road	1
for	1
the	1
famous	1
cave	1
of	1
Montesinos.	1
On	1
the	1
way	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
asked	1
the	1
cousin	1
of	1
what	1
sort	1
and	1
character	1
his	1
pursuits,	1
avocations,	1
and	1
studies	1
were,	1
to	1
which	1
he	1
replied	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
by	1
profession	1
a	1
humanist,	1
and	1
that	1
his	1
pursuits	1
and	1
studies	1
were	1
making	1
books	1
for	1
the	1
press,	1
all	1
of	1
great	1
utility	1
and	1
no	1
less	1
entertainment	1
to	1
the	1
nation.	1
One	1
was	1
called	1
“The	1
Book	1
of	1
Liveries,”	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
described	1
seven	1
hundred	1
and	1
three	1
liveries,	1
with	1
their	1
colours,	1
mottoes,	1
and	1
ciphers,	1
from	1
which	1
gentlemen	1
of	1
the	1
court	1
might	1
pick	1
and	1
choose	1
any	1
they	1
fancied	1
for	1
festivals	1
and	1
revels,	1
without	1
having	1
to	1
go	1
a-begging	1
for	1
them	1
from	1
anyone,	1
or	1
puzzling	1
their	1
brains,	1
as	1
the	1
saying	1
is,	1
to	1
have	1
them	1
appropriate	1
to	1
their	1
objects	1
and	1
purposes;	1
“for,”	1
said	1
he,	1
“I	1
give	1
the	1
jealous,	1
the	1
rejected,	1
the	1
forgotten,	1
the	1
absent,	1
what	1
will	1
suit	1
them,	1
and	1
fit	1
them	1
without	1
fail.	1
I	1
have	1
another	1
book,	1
too,	1
which	1
I	1
shall	1
call	1
‘Metamorphoses,	1
or	1
the	1
Spanish	1
Ovid,’	1
one	1
of	1
rare	1
and	1
original	1
invention,	1
for	1
imitating	1
Ovid	1
in	1
burlesque	1
style,	1
I	1
show	1
in	1
it	1
who	1
the	1
Giralda	1
of	1
Seville	1
and	1
the	1
Angel	1
of	1
the	1
Magdalena	1
were,	1
what	1
the	1
sewer	1
of	1
Vecinguerra	1
at	1
Cordova	1
was,	1
what	1
the	1
bulls	1
of	1
Guisando,	1
the	1
Sierra	1
Morena,	1
the	1
Leganitos	1
and	1
Lavapies	1
fountains	1
at	1
Madrid,	1
not	1
forgetting	1
those	1
of	1
the	1
Piojo,	1
of	1
the	1
Cano	1
Dorado,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
Priora;	1
and	1
all	1
with	1
their	1
allegories,	1
metaphors,	1
and	1
changes,	1
so	1
that	1
they	1
are	1
amusing,	1
interesting,	1
and	1
instructive,	1
all	1
at	1
once.	1
Another	1
book	1
I	1
have	1
which	1
I	1
call	1
‘The	1
Supplement	1
to	1
Polydore	1
Vergil,’	1
which	1
treats	1
of	1
the	1
invention	1
of	1
things,	1
and	1
is	1
a	1
work	1
of	1
great	1
erudition	1
and	1
research,	1
for	1
I	1
establish	1
and	1
elucidate	1
elegantly	1
some	1
things	1
of	1
great	1
importance	1
which	1
Polydore	1
omitted	1
to	1
mention.	1
He	1
forgot	1
to	1
tell	1
us	1
who	1
was	1
the	1
first	1
man	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
that	1
had	1
a	1
cold	1
in	1
his	1
head,	1
and	1
who	1
was	1
the	1
first	1
to	1
try	1
salivation	1
for	1
the	1
French	1
disease,	1
but	1
I	1
give	1
it	1
accurately	1
set	1
forth,	1
and	1
quote	1
more	1
than	1
five-and-twenty	1
authors	1
in	1
proof	1
of	1
it,	1
so	1
you	1
may	1
perceive	1
I	1
have	1
laboured	1
to	1
good	1
purpose	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
book	1
will	1
be	1
of	1
service	1
to	1
the	1
whole	1
world.”	1
Sancho,	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
very	1
attentive	1
to	1
the	1
cousin’s	1
words,	1
said	1
to	1
him,	1
“Tell	1
me,	1
señor—and	1
God	1
give	1
you	1
luck	1
in	1
printing	1
your	1
books—can	1
you	1
tell	1
me	1
(for	1
of	1
course	1
you	1
know,	1
as	1
you	1
know	1
everything)	1
who	1
was	1
the	1
first	1
man	1
that	1
scratched	1
his	1
head?	1
For	1
to	1
my	1
thinking	1
it	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
our	1
father	1
Adam.”	1
“So	1
it	1
must,”	1
replied	1
the	1
cousin;	1
“for	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
doubt	1
but	1
Adam	1
had	1
a	1
head	1
and	1
hair;	1
and	1
being	1
the	1
first	1
man	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
scratched	1
himself	1
sometimes.”	1
“So	1
I	1
think,”	1
said	1
Sancho;	1
“but	1
now	1
tell	1
me,	1
who	1
was	1
the	1
first	1
tumbler	1
in	1
the	1
world?”	1
“Really,	1
brother,”	1
answered	1
the	1
cousin,	1
“I	1
could	1
not	1
at	1
this	1
moment	1
say	1
positively	1
without	1
having	1
investigated	1
it;	1
I	1
will	1
look	1
it	1
up	1
when	1
I	1
go	1
back	1
to	1
where	1
I	1
have	1
my	1
books,	1
and	1
will	1
satisfy	1
you	1
the	1
next	1
time	1
we	1
meet,	1
for	1
this	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
the	1
last	1
time.”	1
“Look	1
here,	1
señor,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“don’t	1
give	1
yourself	1
any	1
trouble	1
about	1
it,	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
just	1
this	1
minute	1
hit	1
upon	1
what	1
I	1
asked	1
you.	1
The	1
first	1
tumbler	1
in	1
the	1
world,	1
you	1
must	1
know,	1
was	1
Lucifer,	1
when	1
they	1
cast	1
or	1
pitched	1
him	1
out	1
of	1
heaven;	1
for	1
he	1
came	1
tumbling	1
into	1
the	1
bottomless	1
pit.”	1
“You	1
are	1
right,	1
friend,”	1
said	1
the	1
cousin;	1
and	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“Sancho,	1
that	1
question	1
and	1
answer	1
are	1
not	1
thine	1
own;	1
thou	1
hast	1
heard	1
them	1
from	1
someone	1
else.”	1
“Hold	1
your	1
peace,	1
señor,”	1
said	1
Sancho;	1
“faith,	1
if	1
I	1
take	1
to	1
asking	1
questions	1
and	1
answering,	1
I’ll	1
go	1
on	1
from	1
this	1
till	1
to-morrow	1
morning.	1
Nay!	1
to	1
ask	1
foolish	1
things	1
and	1
answer	1
nonsense	1
I	1
needn’t	1
go	1
looking	1
for	1
help	1
from	1
my	1
neighbours.”	1
“Thou	1
hast	1
said	1
more	1
than	1
thou	1
art	1
aware	1
of,	1
Sancho,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
“for	1
there	1
are	1
some	1
who	1
weary	1
themselves	1
out	1
in	1
learning	1
and	1
proving	1
things	1
that,	1
after	1
they	1
are	1
known	1
and	1
proved,	1
are	1
not	1
worth	1
a	1
farthing	1
to	1
the	1
understanding	1
or	1
memory.”	1
In	1
this	1
and	1
other	1
pleasant	1
conversation	1
the	1
day	1
went	1
by,	1
and	1
that	1
night	1
they	1
put	1
up	1
at	1
a	1
small	1
hamlet	1
whence	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
more	1
than	1
two	1
leagues	1
to	1
the	1
cave	1
of	1
Montesinos,	1
so	1
the	1
cousin	1
told	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
adding,	1
that	1
if	1
he	1
was	1
bent	1
upon	1
entering	1
it,	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
requisite	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
provide	1
himself	1
with	1
ropes,	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
be	1
tied	1
and	1
lowered	1
into	1
its	1
depths.	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
said	1
that	1
even	1
if	1
it	1
reached	1
to	1
the	1
bottomless	1
pit	1
he	1
meant	1
to	1
see	1
where	1
it	1
went	1
to;	1
so	1
they	1
bought	1
about	1
a	1
hundred	1
fathoms	1
of	1
rope,	1
and	1
next	1
day	1
at	1
two	1
in	1
the	1
afternoon	1
they	1
arrived	1
at	1
the	1
cave,	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
which	1
is	1
spacious	1
and	1
wide,	1
but	1
full	1
of	1
thorn	1
and	1
wild-fig	1
bushes	1
and	1
brambles	1
and	1
briars,	1
so	1
thick	1
and	1
matted	1
that	1
they	1
completely	1
close	1
it	1
up	1
and	1
cover	1
it	1
over.	1
On	1
coming	1
within	1
sight	1
of	1
it	1
the	1
cousin,	1
Sancho,	1
and	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
dismounted,	1
and	1
the	1
first	1
two	1
immediately	1
tied	1
the	1
latter	1
very	1
firmly	1
with	1
the	1
ropes,	1
and	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
girding	1
and	1
swathing	1
him	1
Sancho	1
said	1
to	1
him,	1
“Mind	1
what	1
you	1
are	1
about,	1
master	1
mine;	1
don’t	1
go	1
burying	1
yourself	1
alive,	1
or	1
putting	1
yourself	1
where	1
you’ll	1
be	1
like	1
a	1
bottle	1
put	1
to	1
cool	1
in	1
a	1
well;	1
it’s	1
no	1
affair	1
or	1
business	1
of	1
your	1
worship’s	1
to	1
become	1
the	1
explorer	1
of	1
this,	1
which	1
must	1
be	1
worse	1
than	1
a	1
Moorish	1
dungeon.”	1
“Tie	1
me	1
and	1
hold	1
thy	1
peace,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“for	1
an	1
emprise	1
like	1
this,	1
friend	1
Sancho,	1
was	1
reserved	1
for	1
me;”	1
and	1
said	1
the	1
guide,	1
“I	1
beg	1
of	1
you,	1
Señor	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
to	1
observe	1
carefully	1
and	1
examine	1
with	1
a	1
hundred	1
eyes	1
everything	1
that	1
is	1
within	1
there;	1
perhaps	1
there	1
may	1
be	1
some	1
things	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
put	1
into	1
my	1
book	1
of	1
‘Transformations.’”	1
“The	1
drum	1
is	1
in	1
hands	1
that	1
will	1
know	1
how	1
to	1
beat	1
it	1
well	1
enough,”	1
said	1
Sancho	1
Panza.	1
When	1
he	1
had	1
said	1
this	1
and	1
finished	1
the	1
tying	1
(which	1
was	1
not	1
over	1
the	1
armour	1
but	1
only	1
over	1
the	1
doublet)	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
observed,	1
“It	1
was	1
careless	1
of	1
us	1
not	1
to	1
have	1
provided	1
ourselves	1
with	1
a	1
small	1
cattle-bell	1
to	1
be	1
tied	1
on	1
the	1
rope	1
close	1
to	1
me,	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
which	1
would	1
show	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
still	1
descending	1
and	1
alive;	1
but	1
as	1
that	1
is	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
question	1
now,	1
in	1
God’s	1
hand	1
be	1
it	1
to	1
guide	1
me;”	1
and	1
forthwith	1
he	1
fell	1
on	1
his	1
knees	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
low	1
voice	1
offered	1
up	1
a	1
prayer	1
to	1
heaven,	1
imploring	1
God	1
to	1
aid	1
him	1
and	1
grant	1
him	1
success	1
in	1
this	1
to	1
all	1
appearance	1
perilous	1
and	1
untried	1
adventure,	1
and	1
then	1
exclaimed	1
aloud,	1
“O	1
mistress	1
of	1
my	1
actions	1
and	1
movements,	1
illustrious	1
and	1
peerless	1
Dulcinea	1
del	1
Toboso,	1
if	1
so	1
be	1
the	1
prayers	1
and	1
supplications	1
of	1
this	1
fortunate	1
lover	1
can	1
reach	1
thy	1
ears,	1
by	1
thy	1
incomparable	1
beauty	1
I	1
entreat	1
thee	1
to	1
listen	1
to	1
them,	1
for	1
they	1
but	1
ask	1
thee	1
not	1
to	1
refuse	1
me	1
thy	1
favour	1
and	1
protection	1
now	1
that	1
I	1
stand	1
in	1
such	1
need	1
of	1
them.	1
I	1
am	1
about	1
to	1
precipitate,	1
to	1
sink,	1
to	1
plunge	1
myself	1
into	1
the	1
abyss	1
that	1
is	1
here	1
before	1
me,	1
only	1
to	1
let	1
the	1
world	1
know	1
that	1
while	1
thou	1
dost	1
favour	1
me	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
impossibility	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
attempt	1
and	1
accomplish.”	1
With	1
these	1
words	1
he	1
approached	1
the	1
cavern,	1
and	1
perceived	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
impossible	1
to	1
let	1
himself	1
down	1
or	1
effect	1
an	1
entrance	1
except	1
by	1
sheer	1
force	1
or	1
cleaving	1
a	1
passage;	1
so	1
drawing	1
his	1
sword	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
demolish	1
and	1
cut	1
away	1
the	1
brambles	1
at	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
the	1
cave,	1
at	1
the	1
noise	1
of	1
which	1
a	1
vast	1
multitude	1
of	1
crows	1
and	1
choughs	1
flew	1
out	1
of	1
it	1
so	1
thick	1
and	1
so	1
fast	1
that	1
they	1
knocked	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
down;	1
and	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
as	1
much	1
of	1
a	1
believer	1
in	1
augury	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
Catholic	1
Christian	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
taken	1
it	1
as	1
a	1
bad	1
omen	1
and	1
declined	1
to	1
bury	1
himself	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
place.	1
He	1
got	1
up,	1
however,	1
and	1
as	1
there	1
came	1
no	1
more	1
crows,	1
or	1
night-birds	1
like	1
the	1
bats	1
that	1
flew	1
out	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
with	1
the	1
crows,	1
the	1
cousin	1
and	1
Sancho	1
giving	1
him	1
rope,	1
he	1
lowered	1
himself	1
into	1
the	1
depths	1
of	1
the	1
dread	1
cavern;	1
and	1
as	1
he	1
entered	1
it	1
Sancho	1
sent	1
his	1
blessing	1
after	1
him,	1
making	1
a	1
thousand	1
crosses	1
over	1
him	1
and	1
saying,	1
“God,	1
and	1
the	1
Peña	1
de	1
Francia,	1
and	1
the	1
Trinity	1
of	1
Gaeta	1
guide	1
thee,	1
flower	1
and	1
cream	1
of	1
knights-errant.	1
There	1
thou	1
goest,	1
thou	1
dare-devil	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
heart	1
of	1
steel,	1
arm	1
of	1
brass;	1
once	1
more,	1
God	1
guide	1
thee	1
and	1
send	1
thee	1
back	1
safe,	1
sound,	1
and	1
unhurt	1
to	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
this	1
world	1
thou	1
art	1
leaving	1
to	1
bury	1
thyself	1
in	1
the	1
darkness	1
thou	1
art	1
seeking	1
there;”	1
and	1
the	1
cousin	1
offered	1
up	1
almost	1
the	1
same	1
prayers	1
and	1
supplications.	1

Don	1
Quixote	1
kept	1
calling	1
to	1
them	1
to	1
give	1
him	1
rope	1
and	1
more	1
rope,	1
and	1
they	1
gave	1
it	1
out	1
little	1
by	1
little,	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
time	1
the	1
calls,	1
which	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
cave	1
as	1
out	1
of	1
a	1
pipe,	1
ceased	1
to	1
be	1
heard	1
they	1
had	1
let	1
down	1
the	1
hundred	1
fathoms	1
of	1
rope.	1
They	1
were	1
inclined	1
to	1
pull	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
up	1
again,	1
as	1
they	1
could	1
give	1
him	1
no	1
more	1
rope;	1
however,	1
they	1
waited	1
about	1
half	1
an	1
hour,	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
which	1
time	1
they	1
began	1
to	1
gather	1
in	1
the	1
rope	1
again	1
with	1
great	1
ease	1
and	1
without	1
feeling	1
any	1
weight,	1
which	1
made	1
them	1
fancy	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
was	1
remaining	1
below;	1
and	1
persuaded	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
so,	1
Sancho	1
wept	1
bitterly,	1
and	1
hauled	1
away	1
in	1
great	1
haste	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
settle	1
the	1
question.	1
When,	1
however,	1
they	1
had	1
come	1
to,	1
as	1
it	1
seemed,	1
rather	1
more	1
than	1
eighty	1
fathoms	1
they	1
felt	1
a	1
weight,	1
at	1
which	1
they	1
were	1
greatly	1
delighted;	1
and	1
at	1
last,	1
at	1
ten	1
fathoms	1
more,	1
they	1
saw	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
distinctly,	1
and	1
Sancho	1
called	1
out	1
to	1
him,	1
saying,	1
“Welcome	1
back,	1
señor,	1
for	1
we	1
had	1
begun	1
to	1
think	1
you	1
were	1
going	1
to	1
stop	1
there	1
to	1
found	1
a	1
family.”	1
But	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
answered	1
not	1
a	1

and	1
drawing	1
him	1
out	1
entirely	1
they	1
perceived	1
he	1
had	1
his	1
eyes	1
shut	1
and	1
every	1
appearance	1
of	1
being	1
fast	1
asleep.	1
They	1
stretched	1
him	1
on	1
the	1
ground	1
and	1
untied	1
him,	1
but	1
still	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
awake;	1
however,	1
they	1
rolled	1
him	1
back	1
and	1
forwards	1
and	1
shook	1
and	1
pulled	1
him	1
about,	1
so	1
that	1
after	1
some	1
time	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
himself,	1
stretching	1
himself	1
just	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
were	1
waking	1
up	1
from	1
a	1
deep	1
and	1
sound	1
sleep,	1
and	1
looking	1
about	1
him	1
he	1
said,	1
“God	1
forgive	1
you,	1
friends;	1
ye	1
have	1
taken	1
me	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
sweetest	1
and	1
most	1
delightful	1
existence	1
and	1
spectacle	1
that	1
ever	1
human	1
being	1
enjoyed	1
or	1
beheld.	1
Now	1
indeed	1
do	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
all	1
the	1
pleasures	1
of	1
this	1
life	1
pass	1
away	1
like	1
a	1
shadow	1
and	1
a	1
dream,	1
or	1
fade	1
like	1
the	1
flower	1
of	1
the	1
field.	1
O	1
ill-fated	1
Montesinos!	1
O	1
sore-wounded	1
Durandarte!	1
O	1
unhappy	1
Belerma!	1
O	1
tearful	1
Guadiana,	1
and	1
ye	1
O	1
hapless	1
daughters	1
of	1
Ruidera	1
who	1
show	1
in	1
your	1
waves	1
the	1
tears	1
that	1
flowed	1
from	1
your	1
beauteous	1
eyes!”	1

The	1
cousin	1
and	1
Sancho	1
Panza	1
listened	1
with	1
deep	1
attention	1
to	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
who	1
uttered	1
them	1
as	1
though	1
with	1
immense	1
pain	1
he	1
drew	1
them	1
up	1
from	1
his	1
very	1
bowels.	1
They	1
begged	1
of	1
him	1
to	1
explain	1
himself,	1
and	1
tell	1
them	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
seen	1
in	1
that	1
hell	1
down	1
there.	1
“Hell	1
do	1
you	1
call	1
it?”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
“call	1
it	1
by	1
no	1
such	1
name,	1
for	1
it	1
does	1
not	1
deserve	1
it,	1
as	1
ye	1
shall	1
soon	1
see.”	1
He	1
then	1
begged	1
them	1
to	1
give	1
him	1
something	1
to	1
eat,	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
very	1
hungry.	1
They	1
spread	1
the	1
cousin’s	1
sackcloth	1
on	1
the	1
grass,	1
and	1
put	1
the	1
stores	1
of	1
the	1
alforjas	1
into	1
requisition,	1
and	1
all	1
three	1
sitting	1
down	1
lovingly	1
and	1
sociably,	1
they	1
made	1
a	1
luncheon	1
and	1
a	1
supper	1
of	1
it	1
all	1
in	1
one;	1
and	1
when	1
the	1
sackcloth	1
was	1
removed,	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
of	1
La	1
Mancha	1
said,	1
“Let	1
no	1
one	1
rise,	1
and	1
attend	1
to	1
me,	1
my	1
sons,	1
both	1
of	1
you.”	1

It	1
was	1
about	1
four	1
in	1
the	1
afternoon	1
when	1
the	1
sun,	1
veiled	1
in	1
clouds,	1
with	1
subdued	1
light	1
and	1
tempered	1
beams,	1
enabled	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
to	1
relate,	1
without	1
heat	1
or	1
inconvenience,	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
seen	1
in	1
the	1
cave	1
of	1
Montesinos	1
to	1
his	1
two	1
illustrious	1
hearers,	1
and	1
he	1
began	1
as	1
follows:	1
“A	1
matter	1
of	1
some	1
twelve	1
or	1
fourteen	1
times	1
a	1
man’s	1
height	1
down	1
in	1
this	1
pit,	1
on	1
the	1
right-hand	1
side,	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
recess	1
or	1
space,	1
roomy	1
enough	1
to	1
contain	1
a	1
large	1
cart	1
with	1
its	1
mules.	1
A	1
little	1
light	1
reaches	1
it	1
through	1
some	1
chinks	1
or	1
crevices,	1
communicating	1
with	1
it	1
and	1
open	1
to	1
the	1
surface	1
of	1
the	1
earth.	1
This	1
recess	1
or	1
space	1
I	1
perceived	1
when	1
I	1
was	1
already	1
growing	1
weary	1
and	1
disgusted	1
at	1
finding	1
myself	1
hanging	1
suspended	1
by	1
the	1
rope,	1
travelling	1
downwards	1
into	1
that	1
dark	1
region	1
without	1
any	1
certainty	1
or	1
knowledge	1
of	1
where	1
I	1
was	1
going,	1
so	1
I	1
resolved	1
to	1
enter	1
it	1
and	1
rest	1
myself	1
for	1
a	1
while.	1
I	1
called	1
out,	1
telling	1
you	1
not	1
to	1
let	1
out	1
more	1
rope	1
until	1
I	1
bade	1
you,	1
but	1
you	1
cannot	1
have	1
heard	1
me.	1
I	1
then	1
gathered	1
in	1
the	1
rope	1
you	1
were	1
sending	1
me,	1
and	1
making	1
a	1
coil	1
or	1
pile	1
of	1
it	1
I	1
seated	1
myself	1
upon	1
it,	1
ruminating	1
and	1
considering	1
what	1
I	1
was	1
to	1
do	1
to	1
lower	1
myself	1
to	1
the	1
bottom,	1
having	1
no	1
one	1
to	1
hold	1
me	1
up;	1
and	1
as	1
I	1
was	1
thus	1
deep	1
in	1
thought	1
and	1
perplexity,	1
suddenly	1
and	1
without	1
provocation	1
a	1
profound	1
sleep	1
fell	1
upon	1
me,	1
and	1
when	1
I	1
least	1
expected	1
it,	1
I	1
know	1
not	1
how,	1
I	1
awoke	1
and	1
found	1
myself	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
beautiful,	1
delightful	1
meadow	1
that	1
nature	1
could	1
produce	1
or	1
the	1
most	1
lively	1
human	1
imagination	1
conceive.	1
I	1
opened	1
my	1
eyes,	1
I	1
rubbed	1
them,	1
and	1
found	1
I	1
was	1
not	1
asleep	1
but	1
thoroughly	1
awake.	1
Nevertheless,	1
I	1
felt	1
my	1
head	1
and	1
breast	1
to	1
satisfy	1
myself	1
whether	1
it	1
was	1
I	1
myself	1
who	1
was	1
there	1
or	1
some	1
empty	1
delusive	1
phantom;	1
but	1
touch,	1
feeling,	1
the	1
collected	1
thoughts	1
that	1
passed	1
through	1
my	1
mind,	1
all	1
convinced	1
me	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
the	1
same	1
then	1
and	1
there	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
this	1
moment.	1
Next	1
there	1
presented	1
itself	1
to	1
my	1
sight	1
a	1
stately	1
royal	1
palace	1
or	1
castle,	1
with	1
walls	1
that	1
seemed	1
built	1
of	1
clear	1
transparent	1
crystal;	1
and	1
through	1
two	1
great	1
doors	1
that	1
opened	1
wide	1
therein,	1
I	1
saw	1
coming	1
forth	1
and	1
advancing	1
towards	1
me	1
a	1
venerable	1
old	1
man,	1
clad	1
in	1
a	1
long	1
gown	1
of	1
mulberry-coloured	1
serge	1
that	1
trailed	1
upon	1
the	1
ground.	1
On	1
his	1
shoulders	1
and	1
breast	1
he	1
had	1
a	1
green	1
satin	1
collegiate	1
hood,	1
and	1
covering	1
his	1
head	1
a	1
black	1
Milanese	1
bonnet,	1
and	1
his	1
snow-white	1
beard	1
fell	1
below	1
his	1
girdle.	1
He	1
carried	1
no	1
arms	1
whatever,	1
nothing	1
but	1
a	1
rosary	1
of	1
beads	1
bigger	1
than	1
fair-sized	1
filberts,	1
each	1
tenth	1
bead	1
being	1
like	1
a	1
moderate	1
ostrich	1
egg;	1
his	1
bearing,	1
his	1
gait,	1
his	1
dignity	1
and	1
imposing	1
presence	1
held	1
me	1
spellbound	1
and	1
wondering.	1
He	1
approached	1
me,	1
and	1
the	1
first	1
thing	1
he	1
did	1
was	1
to	1
embrace	1
me	1
closely,	1
and	1
then	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
me,	1
‘For	1
a	1
long	1
time	1
now,	1
O	1
valiant	1
knight	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
of	1
La	1
Mancha,	1
we	1
who	1
are	1
here	1
enchanted	1
in	1
these	1
solitudes	1
have	1
been	1
hoping	1
to	1
see	1
thee,	1
that	1
thou	1
mayest	1
make	1
known	1
to	1
the	1
world	1
what	1
is	1
shut	1
up	1
and	1
concealed	1
in	1
this	1
deep	1
cave,	1
called	1
the	1
cave	1
of	1
Montesinos,	1
which	1
thou	1
hast	1
entered,	1
an	1
achievement	1
reserved	1
for	1
thy	1
invincible	1
heart	1
and	1
stupendous	1
courage	1
alone	1
to	1
attempt.	1
Come	1
with	1
me,	1
illustrious	1
sir,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
show	1
thee	1
the	1
marvels	1
hidden	1
within	1
this	1
transparent	1
castle,	1
whereof	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
alcaide	1
and	1
perpetual	1
warden;	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
Montesinos	1
himself,	1
from	1
whom	1
the	1
cave	1
takes	1
its	1
name.’	1
“The	1
instant	1
he	1
told	1
me	1
he	1
was	1
Montesinos,	1
I	1
asked	1
him	1
if	1
the	1
story	1
they	1
told	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
above	1
here	1
was	1
true,	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
taken	1
out	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
his	1
great	1
friend	1
Durandarte	1
from	1
his	1
breast	1
with	1
a	1
little	1
dagger,	1
and	1
carried	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
lady	1
Belerma,	1
as	1
his	1
friend	1
when	1
at	1
the	1
point	1
of	1
death	1
had	1
commanded	1
him.	1
He	1
said	1
in	1
reply	1
that	1
they	1
spoke	1
the	1
truth	1
in	1
every	1
respect	1
except	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
dagger,	1
for	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
dagger,	1
nor	1
little,	1
but	1
a	1
burnished	1
poniard	1
sharper	1
than	1
an	1
awl.”	1
“That	1
poniard	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
made	1
by	1
Ramon	1
de	1
Hoces	1
the	1
Sevillian,”	1
said	1
Sancho.	1
“I	1
do	1
not	1
know,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
“it	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
been	1
by	1
that	1
poniard	1
maker,	1
however,	1
because	1
Ramon	1
de	1
Hoces	1
was	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
yesterday,	1
and	1
the	1
affair	1
of	1
Roncesvalles,	1
where	1
this	1
mishap	1
occurred,	1
was	1
long	1
ago;	1
but	1
the	1
question	1
is	1
of	1
no	1
great	1
importance,	1
nor	1
does	1
it	1
affect	1
or	1
make	1
any	1
alteration	1
in	1
the	1
truth	1
or	1
substance	1
of	1
the	1
story.”	1
“That	1
is	1
true,”	1
said	1
the	1
cousin;	1
“continue,	1
Señor	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
listening	1
to	1
you	1
with	1
the	1
greatest	1
pleasure	1
in	1
the	1
world.”	1
“And	1
with	1
no	1
less	1
do	1
I	1
tell	1
the	1
tale,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
“and	1
so,	1
to	1
proceed—the	1
venerable	1
Montesinos	1
led	1
me	1
into	1
the	1
palace	1
of	1
crystal,	1
where,	1
in	1
a	1
lower	1
chamber,	1
strangely	1
cool	1
and	1
entirely	1
of	1
alabaster,	1
was	1
an	1
elaborately	1
wrought	1
marble	1
tomb,	1
upon	1
which	1
I	1
beheld,	1
stretched	1
at	1
full	1
length,	1
a	1
knight,	1
not	1
of	1
bronze,	1
or	1
marble,	1
or	1
jasper,	1
as	1
are	1
seen	1
on	1
other	1
tombs,	1
but	1
of	1
actual	1
flesh	1
and	1
bone.	1
His	1
right	1
hand	1
(which	1
seemed	1
to	1
me	1
somewhat	1
hairy	1
and	1
sinewy,	1
a	1
sign	1
of	1
great	1
strength	1
in	1
its	1
owner)	1
lay	1
on	1
the	1
side	1
of	1
his	1
heart;	1
but	1
before	1
I	1
could	1
put	1
any	1
question	1
to	1
Montesinos,	1
he,	1
seeing	1
me	1
gazing	1
at	1
the	1
tomb	1
in	1
amazement,	1
said	1
to	1
me,	1
‘This	1
is	1
my	1
friend	1
Durandarte,	1
flower	1
and	1
mirror	1
of	1
the	1
true	1
lovers	1
and	1
valiant	1
knights	1
of	1
his	1
time.	1
He	1
is	1
held	1
enchanted	1
here,	1
as	1
I	1
myself	1
and	1
many	1
others	1
are,	1
by	1
that	1
French	1
enchanter	1
Merlin,	1
who,	1
they	1
say,	1
was	1
the	1
devil’s	1
son;	1
but	1
my	1
belief	1
is,	1
not	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
the	1
devil’s	1
son,	1
but	1
that	1
he	1
knew,	1
as	1
the	1
saying	1
is,	1
a	1
point	1
more	1
than	1
the	1
devil.	1
How	1
or	1
why	1
he	1
enchanted	1
us,	1
no	1
one	1
knows,	1
but	1
time	1
will	1
tell,	1
and	1
I	1
suspect	1
that	1
time	1
is	1
not	1
far	1
off.	1
What	1
I	1
marvel	1
at	1
is,	1
that	1
I	1
know	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
as	1
sure	1
as	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
now	1
day,	1
that	1
Durandarte	1
ended	1
his	1
life	1
in	1
my	1
arms,	1
and	1
that,	1
after	1
his	1
death,	1
I	1
took	1
out	1
his	1
heart	1
with	1
my	1
own	1
hands;	1
and	1
indeed	1
it	1
must	1
have	1
weighed	1
more	1
than	1
two	1
pounds,	1
for,	1
according	1
to	1
naturalists,	1
he	1
who	1
has	1
a	1
large	1
heart	1
is	1
more	1
largely	1
endowed	1
with	1
valour	1
than	1
he	1
who	1
has	1
a	1
small	1
one.	1
Then,	1
as	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
case,	1
and	1
as	1
the	1
knight	1
did	1
really	1
die,	1
how	1
comes	1
it	1
that	1
he	1
now	1
moans	1
and	1
sighs	1
from	1
time	1
to	1
time,	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
were	1
still	1
alive?’	1

“As	1
he	1
said	1
this,	1
the	1
wretched	1
Durandarte	1
cried	1
out	1
in	1
a	1
loud	1
voice:	1
O	1
cousin	1
Montesinos!	1
’Twas	1
my	1
last	1
request	1
of	1
thee,	1
When	1
my	1
soul	1
hath	1
left	1
the	1
body,	1
And	1
that	1
lying	1
dead	1
I	1
be,	1
With	1
thy	1
poniard	1

thy	1
dagger	1
Cut	1
the	1
heart	1
from	1
out	1
my	1
breast,	1
And	1
bear	1
it	1
to	1
Belerma.	1
This	1
was	1
my	1
last	1
request.”	1
“On	1
hearing	1
which,	1
the	1
venerable	1
Montesinos	1
fell	1
on	1
his	1
knees	1
before	1
the	1
unhappy	1
knight,	1
and	1
with	1
tearful	1
eyes	1
exclaimed,	1
‘Long	1

Señor	1
Durandarte,	1
my	1
beloved	1
cousin,	1

have	1
I	1
done	1
what	1
you	1
bade	1
me	1
on	1
that	1
sad	1
day	1
when	1
I	1
lost	1
you;	1
I	1
took	1
out	1

as	1
I	1
could,	1
not	1
leaving	1
an	1
atom	1
of	1
it	1
in	1
your	1
breast,	1
I	1
wiped	1
it	1
with	1
a	1
lace	1
handkerchief,	1
and	1
I	1
took	1
the	1
road	1
to	1
France	1
with	1
it,	1
having	1
first	1
laid	1
you	1
in	1
the	1
bosom	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
with	1
tears	1
enough	1
to	1
wash	1
and	1
cleanse	1
my	1
hands	1
of	1
the	1
blood	1
that	1
covered	1
them	1
after	1
wandering	1
among	1
your	1
bowels;	1
and	1
more	1
by	1
token,	1
O	1
cousin	1
of	1
my	1
soul,	1
at	1
the	1
first	1
village	1
I	1
came	1
to	1
after	1
leaving	1
Roncesvalles,	1
I	1
sprinkled	1
a	1
little	1
salt	1
upon	1
your	1
heart	1
to	1
keep	1
it	1
sweet,	1
and	1
bring	1
it,	1
if	1
not	1
fresh,	1
at	1
least	1
pickled,	1
into	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
the	1
lady	1
Belerma,	1
whom,	1
together	1
with	1
you,	1
myself,	1
Guadiana	1
your	1
squire,	1
the	1
duenna	1
Ruidera	1
and	1
her	1
seven	1
daughters	1
and	1
two	1
nieces,	1
and	1
many	1
more	1
of	1
your	1
friends	1
and	1
acquaintances,	1
the	1
sage	1
Merlin	1
has	1
been	1
keeping	1
enchanted	1
here	1
these	1
many	1
years;	1
and	1
although	1
more	1
than	1
five	1
hundred	1
have	1
gone	1
by,	1
not	1
one	1
of	1
us	1
has	1
died;	1
Ruidera	1
and	1
her	1
daughters	1
and	1
nieces	1
alone	1
are	1
missing,	1
and	1
these,	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
tears	1
they	1
shed,	1
Merlin,	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
compassion	1
he	1
seems	1
to	1
have	1
felt	1
for	1
them,	1
changed	1
into	1
so	1
many	1
lakes,	1
which	1
to	1
this	1
day	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
of	1
the	1
living,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
province	1
of	1
La	1
Mancha,	1
are	1
called	1
the	1
Lakes	1
of	1
Ruidera.	1
The	1
seven	1
daughters	1
belong	1
to	1
the	1
kings	1
of	1
Spain	1
and	1
the	1
two	1
nieces	1
to	1
the	1
knights	1
of	1
a	1
very	1
holy	1
order	1
called	1
the	1
Order	1
of	1
St.	1
John.	1
Guadiana	1
your	1
squire,	1
likewise	1
bewailing	1
your	1
fate,	1
was	1
changed	1
into	1
a	1
river	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
name,	1
but	1
when	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
surface	1
and	1
beheld	1
the	1
sun	1
of	1
another	1
heaven,	1
so	1
great	1
was	1
his	1
grief	1
at	1
finding	1
he	1
was	1
leaving	1
you,	1
that	1
he	1
plunged	1
into	1
the	1
bowels	1
of	1
the	1
earth;	1
however,	1
as	1
he	1
cannot	1
help	1
following	1
his	1
natural	1
course,	1
he	1
from	1
time	1
to	1
time	1
comes	1
forth	1
and	1
shows	1
himself	1
to	1
the	1
sun	1
and	1
the	1
world.	1
The	1
lakes	1
aforesaid	1
send	1
him	1
their	1
waters,	1
and	1
with	1
these,	1
and	1
others	1
that	1
come	1
to	1
him,	1
he	1
makes	1
a	1
grand	1
and	1
imposing	1
entrance	1
into	1
Portugal;	1
but	1
for	1
all	1
that,	1
go	1
where	1
he	1
may,	1
he	1
shows	1
his	1
melancholy	1
and	1
sadness,	1
and	1
takes	1
no	1
pride	1
in	1
breeding	1
dainty	1
choice	1
fish,	1
only	1
coarse	1
and	1
tasteless	1
sorts,	1
very	1
different	1
from	1
those	1
of	1
the	1
golden	1
Tagus.	1
All	1
this	1
that	1
I	1
tell	1
you	1
now,	1
O	1
cousin	1
mine,	1
I	1
have	1
told	1
you	1
many	1
times	1
before,	1
and	1
as	1
you	1
make	1
no	1
answer,	1
I	1
fear	1
that	1
either	1
you	1
believe	1
me	1
not,	1
or	1
do	1
not	1
hear	1
me,	1
whereat	1
I	1
feel	1
God	1
knows	1
what	1
grief.	1
I	1
have	1
now	1
news	1
to	1
give	1
you,	1
which,	1
if	1
it	1
serves	1
not	1
to	1
alleviate	1
your	1
sufferings,	1
will	1
not	1
in	1
any	1
wise	1
increase	1
them.	1
Know	1
that	1
you	1
have	1
here	1
before	1
you	1
(open	1
your	1
eyes	1
and	1
you	1
will	1
see)	1
that	1
great	1
knight	1
of	1
whom	1
the	1
sage	1
Merlin	1
has	1
prophesied	1
such	1
great	1
things;	1
that	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
of	1
La	1
Mancha	1
I	1
mean,	1
who	1
has	1
again,	1
and	1
to	1
better	1
purpose	1
than	1
in	1
past	1
times,	1
revived	1
in	1
these	1
days	1
knight-errantry,	1
long	1
since	1
forgotten,	1
and	1
by	1
whose	1
intervention	1
and	1
aid	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
we	1
shall	1
be	1
disenchanted;	1
for	1
great	1
deeds	1
are	1
reserved	1
for	1
great	1
men.’	1
“‘And	1
if	1
that	1
may	1
not	1
be,’	1
said	1
the	1
wretched	1
Durandarte	1
in	1
a	1
low	1
and	1
feeble	1
voice,	1
‘if	1
that	1
may	1
not	1
be,	1
then,	1
my	1
cousin,	1
I	1
say	1
“patience	1
and	1
shuffle;”’	1
and	1
turning	1
over	1
on	1
his	1
side,	1
he	1
relapsed	1
into	1
his	1
former	1
silence	1
without	1
uttering	1
another	1
word.	1

“And	1
now	1
there	1
was	1
heard	1
a	1
great	1
outcry	1
and	1
lamentation,	1
accompanied	1
by	1
deep	1
sighs	1
and	1
bitter	1
sobs.	1
I	1
looked	1
round,	1
and	1
through	1
the	1
crystal	1
wall	1
I	1
saw	1
passing	1
through	1
another	1
chamber	1
a	1
procession	1
of	1
two	1
lines	1
of	1
fair	1
damsels	1
all	1
clad	1
in	1
mourning,	1
and	1
with	1
white	1
turbans	1
of	1
Turkish	1
fashion	1
on	1
their	1
heads.	1
Behind,	1
in	1
the	1
rear	1
of	1
these,	1
there	1
came	1
a	1
lady,	1
for	1
so	1
from	1
her	1
dignity	1
she	1
seemed	1
to	1
be,	1
also	1
clad	1
in	1
black,	1
with	1
a	1
white	1
veil	1
so	1
long	1
and	1
ample	1
that	1
it	1
swept	1
the	1
ground.	1
Her	1
turban	1
was	1
twice	1
as	1
large	1
as	1
the	1
largest	1
of	1
any	1
of	1
the	1
others;	1
her	1
eyebrows	1
met,	1
her	1
nose	1
was	1
rather	1
flat,	1
her	1
mouth	1
was	1
large	1
but	1
with	1
ruddy	1
lips,	1
and	1
her	1
teeth,	1
of	1
which	1
at	1
times	1
she	1
allowed	1
a	1
glimpse,	1
were	1
seen	1
to	1
be	1
sparse	1
and	1
ill-set,	1
though	1
as	1
white	1
as	1
peeled	1
almonds.	1
She	1
carried	1
in	1
her	1
hands	1
a	1
fine	1
cloth,	1
and	1
in	1
it,	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
I	1
could	1
make	1
out,	1
a	1
heart	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
mummied,	1
so	1
parched	1
and	1
dried	1
was	1
it.	1
Montesinos	1
told	1
me	1
that	1
all	1
those	1
forming	1
the	1
procession	1
were	1
the	1
attendants	1
of	1
Durandarte	1
and	1
Belerma,	1
who	1
were	1
enchanted	1
there	1
with	1
their	1
master	1
and	1
mistress,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
last,	1
she	1
who	1
carried	1
the	1
heart	1
in	1
the	1
cloth,	1
was	1
the	1
lady	1
Belerma,	1
who,	1
with	1
her	1
damsels,	1
four	1
days	1
in	1
the	1
week	1
went	1
in	1
procession	1
singing,	1
or	1
rather	1
weeping,	1
dirges	1
over	1
the	1
body	1
and	1
miserable	1
heart	1
of	1
his	1
cousin;	1
and	1
that	1
if	1
she	1
appeared	1
to	1
me	1
somewhat	1
ill-favoured	1
or	1
not	1
so	1
beautiful	1
as	1
fame	1
reported	1
her,	1
it	1
was	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
bad	1
nights	1
and	1
worse	1
days	1
that	1
she	1
passed	1
in	1
that	1
enchantment,	1
as	1
I	1
could	1
see	1
by	1
the	1
great	1
dark	1
circles	1
round	1
her	1
eyes,	1
and	1
her	1
sickly	1
complexion;	1
‘her	1
sallowness,	1
and	1
the	1
rings	1
round	1
her	1
eyes,’	1
said	1
he,	1
‘are	1
not	1
caused	1
by	1
the	1
periodical	1
ailment	1
usual	1
with	1
women,	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
many	1
months	1
and	1
even	1
years	1
since	1
she	1
has	1
had	1
any,	1
but	1
by	1
the	1
grief	1
her	1
own	1
heart	1
suffers	1
because	1
of	1
that	1
which	1
she	1
holds	1
in	1
her	1
hand	1
perpetually,	1
and	1
which	1
recalls	1
and	1
brings	1
back	1
to	1
her	1
memory	1
the	1
sad	1
fate	1
of	1
her	1
lost	1
lover;	1
were	1
it	1
not	1
for	1
this,	1
hardly	1
would	1
the	1
great	1
Dulcinea	1
del	1
Toboso,	1
so	1
celebrated	1
in	1
all	1
these	1
parts,	1
and	1
even	1
in	1
the	1
world,	1
come	1
up	1
to	1
her	1
for	1
beauty,	1
grace,	1
and	1
gaiety.’	1
“‘Hold	1
hard!’	1
said	1
I	1
at	1
this,	1
‘tell	1
your	1
story	1
as	1
you	1
ought,	1
Señor	1
Don	1
Montesinos,	1
for	1
you	1
know	1
very	1
well	1
that	1
all	1
comparisons	1
are	1
odious,	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
occasion	1
to	1
compare	1
one	1
person	1
with	1
another;	1
the	1
peerless	1
Dulcinea	1
del	1
Toboso	1
is	1
what	1
she	1
is,	1
and	1
the	1
lady	1
Doña	1
Belerma	1
is	1
what	1
_she_	1
is	1
and	1
has	1
been,	1
and	1
that’s	1
enough.’	1
To	1
which	1
he	1
made	1
answer,	1
‘Forgive	1
me,	1
Señor	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
I	1
own	1
I	1
was	1
wrong	1
and	1
spoke	1
unadvisedly	1
in	1
saying	1
that	1
the	1
lady	1
Dulcinea	1
could	1
scarcely	1
come	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
lady	1
Belerma;	1
for	1
it	1
were	1
enough	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
have	1
learned,	1
by	1
what	1
means	1
I	1
know	1
not,	1
that	1
you	1
are	1
her	1
knight,	1
to	1
make	1
me	1
bite	1
my	1
tongue	1
out	1
before	1
I	1
compared	1
her	1
to	1
anything	1
save	1
heaven	1
itself.’	1
After	1
this	1
apology	1
which	1
the	1
great	1
Montesinos	1
made	1
me,	1
my	1
heart	1
recovered	1
itself	1
from	1
the	1
shock	1
I	1
had	1
received	1
in	1
hearing	1
my	1
lady	1
compared	1
with	1
Belerma.”	1
“Still	1
I	1
wonder,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“that	1
your	1
worship	1
did	1
not	1
get	1
upon	1
the	1
old	1
fellow	1
and	1
bruise	1
every	1
bone	1
of	1
him	1
with	1
kicks,	1
and	1
pluck	1
his	1
beard	1
until	1
you	1
didn’t	1
leave	1
a	1
hair	1
in	1
it.”	1
“Nay,	1
Sancho,	1
my	1
friend,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“it	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
been	1
right	1
in	1
me	1
to	1
do	1
that,	1
for	1
we	1
are	1
all	1
bound	1
to	1
pay	1
respect	1
to	1
the	1
aged,	1
even	1
though	1
they	1
be	1
not	1
knights,	1
but	1
especially	1
to	1
those	1
who	1
are,	1
and	1
who	1
are	1
enchanted;	1
I	1
only	1
know	1
I	1
gave	1
him	1
as	1
good	1
as	1
he	1
brought	1
in	1
the	1
many	1
other	1
questions	1
and	1
answers	1
we	1
exchanged.”	1
“I	1
cannot	1
understand,	1
Señor	1
Don	1
Quixote,”	1
remarked	1
the	1
cousin	1
here,	1
“how	1
it	1
is	1
that	1
your	1
worship,	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
short	1
space	1
of	1
time	1
as	1
you	1
have	1
been	1
below	1
there,	1
could	1
have	1
seen	1
so	1
many	1
things,	1
and	1
said	1
and	1
answered	1
so	1
much.”	1
“How	1
long	1
is	1
it	1
since	1
I	1
went	1
down?”	1
asked	1
Don	1
Quixote.	1
“Little	1
better	1
than	1
an	1
hour,”	1
replied	1
Sancho.	1
“That	1
cannot	1
be,”	1
returned	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“because	1
night	1
overtook	1
me	1
while	1
I	1
was	1
there,	1
and	1
day	1
came,	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
night	1
again	1
and	1
day	1
again	1
three	1
times;	1
so	1
that,	1
by	1
my	1
reckoning,	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
three	1
days	1
in	1
those	1
remote	1
regions	1
beyond	1
our	1
ken.”	1
“My	1
master	1
must	1
be	1
right,”	1
replied	1
Sancho;	1
“for	1
as	1
everything	1
that	1
has	1
happened	1
to	1
him	1
is	1
by	1
enchantment,	1
maybe	1
what	1
seems	1
to	1
us	1
an	1
hour	1
would	1
seem	1
three	1
days	1
and	1
nights	1
there.”	1
“That’s	1
it,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote.	1
“And	1
did	1
your	1
worship	1
eat	1
anything	1
all	1
that	1
time,	1
señor?”	1
asked	1
the	1
cousin.	1
“I	1
never	1
touched	1
a	1
morsel,”	1
answered	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“nor	1
did	1
I	1
feel	1
hunger,	1
or	1
think	1
of	1
it.”	1
“And	1
do	1
the	1
enchanted	1
eat?”	1
said	1
the	1
cousin.	1
“They	1
neither	1
eat,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
“nor	1
are	1
they	1
subject	1
to	1
the	1
greater	1
excrements,	1
though	1
it	1
is	1
thought	1
that	1
their	1
nails,	1
beards,	1
and	1
hair	1
grow.”	1
“And	1
do	1
the	1
enchanted	1
sleep,	1
now,	1
señor?”	1
asked	1
Sancho.	1
“Certainly	1
not,”	1
replied	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
“at	1
least,	1
during	1
those	1
three	1
days	1
I	1
was	1
with	1
them	1
not	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
closed	1
an	1
eye,	1
nor	1
did	1
I	1
either.”	1
“The	1
proverb,	1
‘Tell	1
me	1
what	1
company	1
thou	1
keepest	1
and	1
I’ll	1
tell	1
thee	1
what	1
thou	1
art,’	1
is	1
to	1
the	1
point	1
here,”	1
said	1
Sancho;	1
“your	1
worship	1
keeps	1
company	1
with	1
enchanted	1
people	1
that	1
are	1
always	1
fasting	1
and	1
watching;	1
what	1
wonder	1
is	1
it,	1
then,	1
that	1
you	1
neither	1
eat	1
nor	1
sleep	1
while	1
you	1
are	1
with	1
them?	1
But	1
forgive	1
me,	1
señor,	1
if	1
I	1
say	1
that	1
of	1
all	1
this	1
you	1
have	1
told	1
us	1
now,	1
may	1
God	1
take	1
me—I	1
was	1
just	1
going	1
to	1
say	1
the	1
devil—if	1
I	1
believe	1
a	1
single	1
particle.”	1
“What!”	1
said	1
the	1
cousin,	1
“has	1
Señor	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
then,	1
been	1
lying?	1
Why,	1
even	1
if	1
he	1
wished	1
it	1
he	1
has	1
not	1
had	1
time	1
to	1
imagine	1
and	1
put	1
together	1
such	1
a	1
host	1
of	1
lies.”	1
“I	1
don’t	1
believe	1
my	1
master	1
lies,”	1
said	1
Sancho.	1
“If	1
not,	1
what	1
dost	1
thou	1
believe?”	1
asked	1
Don	1
Quixote.	1
“I	1
believe,”	1
replied	1
Sancho,	1
“that	1
this	1
Merlin,	1
or	1
those	1
enchanters	1
who	1
enchanted	1
the	1
whole	1
crew	1
your	1
worship	1
says	1
you	1
saw	1
and	1
discoursed	1
with	1
down	1
there,	1
stuffed	1
your	1
imagination	1
or	1
your	1
mind	1
with	1
all	1
this	1
rigmarole	1
you	1
have	1
been	1
treating	1
us	1
to,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
is	1
still	1
to	1
come.”	1
“All	1
that	1
might	1
be,	1
Sancho,”	1
replied	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
“but	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
so,	1
for	1
everything	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
told	1
you	1
I	1
saw	1
with	1
my	1
own	1
eyes,	1
and	1
touched	1
with	1
my	1
own	1
hands.	1
But	1
what	1
will	1
you	1
say	1
when	1
I	1
tell	1
you	1
now	1
how,	1
among	1
the	1
countless	1
other	1
marvellous	1
things	1
Montesinos	1
showed	1
me	1
(of	1
which	1
at	1
leisure	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
proper	1
time	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
thee	1
an	1
account	1
in	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
our	1
journey,	1
for	1
they	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
all	1
in	1
place	1
here),	1
he	1
showed	1
me	1
three	1
country	1
girls	1
who	1
went	1
skipping	1
and	1
capering	1
like	1
goats	1
over	1
the	1
pleasant	1
fields	1
there,	1
and	1
the	1
instant	1
I	1
beheld	1
them	1
I	1
knew	1
one	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
peerless	1
Dulcinea	1
del	1
Toboso,	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
two	1
those	1
same	1
country	1
girls	1
that	1
were	1
with	1
her	1
and	1
that	1
we	1
spoke	1
to	1
on	1
the	1
road	1
from	1
El	1
Toboso!	1
I	1
asked	1
Montesinos	1
if	1
he	1
knew	1
them,	1
and	1
he	1
told	1
me	1
he	1
did	1
not,	1
but	1
he	1
thought	1
they	1
must	1
be	1
some	1
enchanted	1
ladies	1
of	1
distinction,	1
for	1
it	1
was	1
only	1
a	1
few	1
days	1
before	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
made	1
their	1
appearance	1
in	1
those	1
meadows;	1
but	1
I	1
was	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
surprised	1
at	1
that,	1
because	1
there	1
were	1
a	1
great	1
many	1
other	1
ladies	1
there	1
of	1
times	1
past	1
and	1
present,	1
enchanted	1
in	1
various	1
strange	1
shapes,	1
and	1
among	1
them	1
he	1
had	1
recognised	1
Queen	1
Guinevere	1
and	1
her	1
dame	1
Quintañona,	1
she	1
who	1
poured	1
out	1
the	1
wine	1
for	1
Lancelot	1
when	1
he	1
came	1
from	1
Britain.”	1
When	1
Sancho	1
Panza	1
heard	1
his	1
master	1
say	1
this	1
he	1
was	1
ready	1
to	1
take	1
leave	1
of	1
his	1
senses,	1
or	1
die	1
with	1
laughter;	1
for,	1
as	1
he	1
knew	1
the	1
real	1
truth	1
about	1
the	1
pretended	1
enchantment	1
of	1
Dulcinea,	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
himself	1
had	1
been	1
the	1
enchanter	1
and	1
concocter	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
evidence,	1
he	1
made	1
up	1
his	1
mind	1
at	1
last	1
that,	1
beyond	1
all	1
doubt,	1
his	1
master	1
was	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
wits	1
and	1
stark	1
mad,	1
so	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
him,	1
“It	1
was	1
an	1
evil	1
hour,	1
a	1
worse	1
season,	1
and	1
a	1
sorrowful	1
day,	1
when	1
your	1
worship,	1
dear	1
master	1
mine,	1
went	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
world,	1
and	1
an	1
unlucky	1
moment	1
when	1
you	1
met	1
with	1
Señor	1
Montesinos,	1
who	1
has	1
sent	1
you	1
back	1
to	1
us	1
like	1
this.	1
You	1
were	1
well	1
enough	1
here	1
above	1
in	1
your	1
full	1
senses,	1
such	1
as	1
God	1
had	1
given	1
you,	1
delivering	1
maxims	1
and	1
giving	1
advice	1
at	1
every	1
turn,	1
and	1
not	1
as	1
you	1
are	1
now,	1
talking	1
the	1
greatest	1
nonsense	1
that	1
can	1
be	1
imagined.”	1
“As	1
I	1
know	1
thee,	1
Sancho,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“I	1
heed	1
not	1
thy	1
words.”	1
“Nor	1
I	1
your	1
worship’s,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“whether	1
you	1
beat	1
me	1
or	1
kill	1
me	1
for	1
those	1
I	1
have	1
spoken,	1
and	1
will	1
speak	1
if	1
you	1
don’t	1
correct	1
and	1
mend	1
your	1
own.	1
But	1
tell	1
me,	1
while	1
we	1
are	1
still	1
at	1
peace,	1
how	1
or	1
by	1
what	1
did	1
you	1
recognise	1
the	1
lady	1
our	1
mistress;	1
and	1
if	1
you	1
spoke	1
to	1
her,	1
what	1
did	1
you	1
say,	1
and	1
what	1
did	1
she	1
answer?”	1
“I	1
recognised	1
her,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“by	1
her	1
wearing	1
the	1
same	1
garments	1
she	1
wore	1
when	1
thou	1
didst	1
point	1
her	1
out	1
to	1
me.	1
I	1
spoke	1
to	1
her,	1
but	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
utter	1
a	1
word	1
in	1
reply;	1
on	1
the	1
contrary,	1
she	1
turned	1
her	1
back	1
on	1
me	1
and	1
took	1
to	1
flight,	1
at	1
such	1
a	1
pace	1
that	1
crossbow	1
bolt	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
overtaken	1
her.	1
I	1
wished	1
to	1
follow	1
her,	1
and	1
would	1
have	1
done	1
so	1
had	1
not	1
Montesinos	1
recommended	1
me	1
not	1
to	1
take	1
the	1
trouble	1
as	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
useless,	1
particularly	1
as	1
the	1
time	1
was	1
drawing	1
near	1
when	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
necessary	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
quit	1
the	1
cavern.	1
He	1
told	1
me,	1
moreover,	1
that	1
in	1
course	1
of	1
time	1
he	1
would	1
let	1
me	1
know	1
how	1
he	1
and	1
Belerma,	1
and	1
Durandarte,	1
and	1
all	1
who	1
were	1
there,	1
were	1
to	1
be	1
disenchanted.	1
But	1
of	1
all	1
I	1
saw	1
and	1
observed	1
down	1
there,	1
what	1
gave	1
me	1
most	1
pain	1
was,	1
that	1
while	1
Montesinos	1
was	1
speaking	1
to	1
me,	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
two	1
companions	1
of	1
the	1
hapless	1
Dulcinea	1
approached	1
me	1
on	1
one	1
without	1
my	1
having	1
seen	1
her	1
coming,	1
and	1
with	1
tears	1
in	1
her	1
eyes	1
said	1
to	1
me,	1
in	1
a	1
low,	1
agitated	1
voice,	1
‘My	1
lady	1
Dulcinea	1
del	1
Toboso	1
kisses	1
your	1
worship’s	1
hands,	1
and	1
entreats	1
you	1
to	1
do	1
her	1
the	1
favour	1
of	1
letting	1
her	1
know	1
how	1
you	1
are;	1
and,	1
being	1
in	1
great	1
need,	1
she	1
also	1
entreats	1
your	1
worship	1
as	1
earnestly	1
as	1
she	1
can	1
to	1
be	1
so	1
good	1
as	1
to	1
lend	1
her	1
half	1
a	1
dozen	1
reals,	1
or	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
you	1
may	1
have	1
about	1
you,	1
on	1
this	1
new	1
dimity	1
petticoat	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
here;	1
and	1
she	1
promises	1
to	1
repay	1
them	1
very	1
speedily.’	1
I	1
was	1
amazed	1
and	1
taken	1
aback	1
by	1
such	1
a	1
message,	1
and	1
turning	1
to	1
Señor	1
Montesinos	1
I	1
asked	1
him,	1
‘Is	1
it	1
possible,	1
Señor	1
Montesinos,	1
that	1
persons	1
of	1
distinction	1
under	1
enchantment	1
can	1
be	1
in	1
need?’	1
To	1
which	1
he	1
replied,	1
‘Believe	1
me,	1
Señor	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
called	1
need	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
met	1
with	1
everywhere,	1
and	1
penetrates	1
all	1
quarters	1
and	1
reaches	1
everyone,	1
and	1
does	1
not	1
spare	1
even	1
the	1
enchanted;	1
and	1
as	1
the	1
lady	1
Dulcinea	1
del	1
Toboso	1
sends	1
to	1
beg	1
those	1
six	1
reals,	1
and	1
the	1
pledge	1
is	1
to	1
all	1
appearance	1
a	1
good	1
one,	1
there	1
is	1
nothing	1
for	1
it	1
but	1
to	1
give	1
them	1
to	1
her,	1
for	1
no	1
doubt	1
she	1
must	1
be	1
in	1
some	1
great	1
strait.’	1
‘I	1
will	1
take	1
no	1
pledge	1
of	1
her,’	1
I	1
replied,	1
‘nor	1
yet	1
can	1
I	1
give	1
her	1
what	1
she	1
asks,	1
for	1
all	1
I	1
have	1
is	1
four	1
reals;	1
which	1
I	1
gave	1
(they	1
were	1
those	1
which	1
thou,	1
Sancho,	1
gavest	1
me	1
the	1
other	1
day	1
to	1
bestow	1
in	1
alms	1
upon	1
the	1
poor	1
I	1
met	1
along	1
the	1
road),	1
and	1
I	1
said,	1
‘Tell	1
your	1
mistress,	1
my	1
dear,	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
grieved	1
to	1
the	1
heart	1
because	1
of	1
her	1
distresses,	1
and	1
wish	1
I	1
was	1
a	1
Fucar	1
to	1
remedy	1
them,	1
and	1
that	1
I	1
would	1
have	1
her	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
cannot	1
be,	1
and	1
ought	1
not	1
be,	1
in	1
health	1
while	1
deprived	1
of	1
the	1
happiness	1
of	1
seeing	1
her	1
and	1
enjoying	1
her	1
discreet	1
conversation,	1
and	1
that	1
I	1
implore	1
her	1
as	1
earnestly	1
as	1
I	1
can,	1
to	1
allow	1
herself	1
to	1
be	1
seen	1
and	1
addressed	1
by	1
this	1
her	1
captive	1
servant	1
and	1
forlorn	1
knight.	1
Tell	1
her,	1
too,	1
that	1
when	1
she	1
least	1
expects	1
it	1
she	1
will	1
hear	1
it	1
announced	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
made	1
an	1
oath	1
and	1
vow	1
after	1
the	1
fashion	1
of	1
that	1
which	1
the	1
Marquis	1
of	1
Mantua	1
made	1
to	1
avenge	1
his	1
nephew	1
Baldwin,	1
when	1
he	1
found	1
him	1
at	1
the	1
point	1
of	1
death	1
in	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
the	1
mountains,	1
which	1
was,	1
not	1
to	1
eat	1
bread	1
off	1
a	1
tablecloth,	1
and	1
other	1
trifling	1
matters	1
which	1
he	1
added,	1
until	1
he	1
had	1
avenged	1
him;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
the	1
same	1
to	1
take	1
no	1
rest,	1
and	1
to	1
roam	1
the	1
seven	1
regions	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
more	1
thoroughly	1
than	1
the	1
Infante	1
Don	1
Pedro	1
of	1
Portugal	1
ever	1
roamed	1
them,	1
until	1
I	1
have	1
disenchanted	1
her.’	1
‘All	1
that	1
and	1
more,	1
you	1
owe	1
my	1
lady,’	1
the	1
damsel’s	1
answer	1
to	1
me,	1
and	1
taking	1
the	1
four	1
reals,	1
instead	1
of	1
making	1
me	1
a	1
curtsey	1
she	1
cut	1
a	1
caper,	1
springing	1
two	1
full	1
yards	1
into	1
the	1
air.”	1
“O	1
blessed	1
God!”	1
exclaimed	1
Sancho	1
aloud	1
at	1
this,	1
“is	1
it	1
possible	1
that	1
such	1
things	1
can	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
world,	1
and	1
that	1
enchanters	1
and	1
enchantments	1
can	1
have	1
such	1
power	1
in	1
it	1
as	1
to	1
have	1
changed	1
my	1
master’s	1
right	1
senses	1
into	1
a	1
craze	1
so	1
full	1
of	1
absurdity!	1
O	1
señor,	1
señor,	1
for	1
God’s	1
sake,	1
consider	1
yourself,	1
have	1
a	1
care	1
for	1
your	1
honour,	1
and	1
give	1
no	1
credit	1
to	1
this	1
silly	1
stuff	1
that	1
has	1
left	1
you	1
scant	1
and	1
short	1
of	1
wits.”	1
“Thou	1
talkest	1
in	1
this	1
way	1
because	1
thou	1
lovest	1
me,	1
Sancho,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
“and	1
not	1
being	1
experienced	1
in	1
the	1
things	1
of	1
the	1
world,	1
everything	1
that	1
has	1
some	1
difficulty	1
about	1
it	1
seems	1
to	1
thee	1
impossible;	1
but	1
time	1
will	1
pass,	1
as	1
I	1
said	1
before,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
tell	1
thee	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
things	1
I	1
saw	1
down	1
there	1
which	1
will	1
make	1
thee	1
believe	1
what	1
I	1
have	1
related	1
now,	1
the	1
truth	1
of	1
which	1
admits	1
of	1
neither	1
reply	1
nor	1
question.”	1

He	1
who	1
translated	1
this	1
great	1
history	1
from	1
the	1
original	1
written	1
by	1
its	1
first	1
author,	1
Cide	1
Hamete	1
Benengeli,	1
says	1
that	1
on	1
coming	1
to	1
the	1
chapter	1
giving	1
the	1
adventures	1
of	1
the	1
cave	1
of	1
Montesinos	1
he	1
found	1
written	1
on	1
the	1
margin	1
of	1
it,	1
in	1
Hamete’s	1
own	1
hand,	1
these	1
exact	1
words:	1
“I	1
cannot	1
convince	1
or	1
persuade	1
myself	1
that	1
everything	1
that	1
is	1
written	1
in	1
the	1
preceding	1
chapter	1
could	1
have	1
precisely	1
happened	1
to	1
the	1
valiant	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
and	1
for	1
this	1
reason,	1
that	1
all	1
the	1
adventures	1
that	1
have	1
occurred	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
present	1
have	1
been	1
possible	1
and	1
probable;	1
but	1
as	1
for	1
this	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
cave,	1
I	1
see	1
no	1
way	1
of	1
accepting	1
it	1
as	1
true,	1
as	1
it	1
passes	1
all	1
reasonable	1
bounds.	1
For	1
me	1
to	1
believe	1
that	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
could	1
lie,	1
he	1
being	1
the	1
most	1
truthful	1
gentleman	1
and	1
the	1
noblest	1
knight	1
of	1
his	1
time,	1
is	1
impossible;	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
told	1
a	1
lie	1
though	1
he	1
were	1
shot	1
to	1
death	1
with	1
arrows.	1
On	1
the	1
other	1
hand,	1
I	1
reflect	1
that	1
he	1
related	1
and	1
told	1
the	1
story	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
circumstances	1
detailed,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
in	1
so	1
short	1
a	1
space	1
have	1
fabricated	1
such	1
a	1
vast	1
complication	1
of	1
absurdities;	1
if,	1
then,	1
this	1
adventure	1
seems	1
apocryphal,	1
it	1
is	1
no	1
fault	1
of	1
mine;	1
and	1
so,	1
without	1
affirming	1
its	1
falsehood	1
or	1
its	1
truth,	1
I	1
write	1
it	1
down.	1
Decide	1
for	1
thyself	1
in	1
thy	1
wisdom,	1
reader;	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
bound,	1
nor	1
is	1
it	1
in	1
my	1
power,	1
to	1
do	1
more;	1
though	1
certain	1
it	1
is	1
they	1
say	1
that	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
his	1
death	1
he	1
retracted,	1
and	1
said	1
he	1
had	1
invented	1
it,	1
thinking	1
it	1
matched	1
and	1
tallied	1
with	1
the	1
adventures	1
he	1
had	1
read	1
of	1
in	1
his	1
histories.”	1
And	1
then	1
he	1
goes	1
on	1
to	1
say:	1
The	1
cousin	1
was	1
amazed	1
as	1
well	1
at	1
Sancho’s	1
boldness	1
as	1
at	1
the	1
patience	1
of	1
his	1
master,	1
and	1
concluded	1
that	1
the	1
good	1
temper	1
the	1
latter	1
displayed	1
arose	1
from	1
the	1
happiness	1
he	1
felt	1
at	1
having	1
seen	1
his	1
lady	1
Dulcinea,	1
even	1
enchanted	1
as	1
she	1
was;	1
because	1
otherwise	1
the	1
words	1
and	1
language	1
Sancho	1
had	1
addressed	1
to	1
him	1
deserved	1
a	1
thrashing;	1
for	1
indeed	1
he	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
rather	1
impudent	1
to	1
his	1
master,	1
to	1
whom	1
he	1
now	1
observed,	1
“I,	1
Señor	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
of	1
La	1
Mancha,	1
look	1
upon	1
the	1
time	1
I	1
have	1
spent	1
in	1
travelling	1
with	1
your	1
worship	1
as	1
very	1
well	1
employed,	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
gained	1
four	1
things	1
in	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
it;	1
the	1
first	1
is	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
made	1
your	1
acquaintance,	1
which	1
I	1
consider	1
great	1
good	1
fortune;	1
the	1
second,	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
learned	1
what	1
the	1
cave	1
of	1
Montesinos	1
contains,	1
together	1
with	1
the	1
transformations	1
of	1
Guadiana	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
lakes	1
of	1
Ruidera;	1
which	1
will	1
be	1
of	1
use	1
to	1
me	1
for	1
the	1
Spanish	1
Ovid	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
in	1
hand;	1
the	1
third,	1
to	1
have	1
discovered	1
the	1
antiquity	1
of	1
cards,	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
in	1
use	1
at	1
least	1
in	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
Charlemagne,	1
as	1
may	1
be	1
inferred	1
from	1
the	1
words	1
you	1
say	1
Durandarte	1
uttered	1
when,	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
that	1
long	1
spell	1
while	1
Montesinos	1
was	1
talking	1
to	1
him,	1
he	1
woke	1
up	1
and	1
said,	1
‘Patience	1
and	1
shuffle.’	1
This	1
phrase	1
and	1
expression	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
learned	1
while	1
he	1
was	1
enchanted,	1
but	1
only	1
before	1
he	1
had	1
become	1
so,	1
in	1
France,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
the	1
aforesaid	1
emperor	1
Charlemagne.	1
And	1
this	1
demonstration	1
is	1
just	1
the	1
thing	1
for	1
me	1
for	1
that	1
other	1
book	1
I	1
am	1
writing,	1
the	1
‘Supplement	1
to	1
Polydore	1
Vergil	1
on	1
the	1
Invention	1
of	1
Antiquities;’	1
for	1
I	1
believe	1
he	1
never	1
thought	1
of	1
inserting	1
that	1
of	1
cards	1
in	1
his	1
book,	1
as	1
I	1
mean	1
to	1
do	1
in	1
mine,	1
and	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
a	1
matter	1
of	1
great	1
importance,	1
particularly	1
when	1
I	1
can	1
cite	1
so	1
grave	1
and	1
veracious	1
an	1
authority	1
as	1
Señor	1
Durandarte.	1
And	1
the	1
fourth	1
thing	1
is,	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
ascertained	1
the	1
source	1
of	1
the	1
river	1
Guadiana,	1
heretofore	1
unknown	1
to	1
mankind.”	1
“You	1
are	1
right,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
“but	1
I	1
should	1
like	1
to	1
know,	1
if	1
by	1
God’s	1
favour	1
they	1
grant	1
you	1
a	1
licence	1
to	1
print	1
those	1
books	1
of	1
yours—which	1
I	1
doubt—to	1
whom	1
do	1
you	1
mean	1
to	1
dedicate	1
them?”	1
“There	1
are	1
lords	1
and	1
grandees	1
in	1
Spain	1
to	1
whom	1
they	1
can	1
be	1
dedicated,”	1
said	1
the	1
cousin.	1
“Not	1
many,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
“not	1
that	1
they	1
are	1
unworthy	1
of	1
it,	1
but	1
because	1
they	1
do	1
not	1
care	1
to	1
accept	1
books	1
and	1
incur	1
the	1
obligation	1
of	1
making	1
the	1
return	1
that	1
seems	1
due	1
to	1
the	1
author’s	1
labour	1
and	1
courtesy.	1
One	1
prince	1
I	1
know	1
who	1
makes	1
up	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
rest,	1
and	1
more—how	1
much	1
more,	1
if	1
I	1
ventured	1
to	1
say,	1
perhaps	1
I	1
should	1
stir	1
up	1
envy	1
in	1
many	1
a	1
noble	1
breast;	1
but	1
let	1
this	1
stand	1
over	1
for	1
some	1
more	1
convenient	1
time,	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
go	1
and	1
look	1
for	1
some	1
place	1
to	1
shelter	1
ourselves	1
in	1
to-night.”	1
“Not	1
far	1
from	1
this,”	1
said	1
the	1
cousin,	1
“there	1
is	1
a	1
hermitage,	1
where	1
there	1
lives	1
a	1
hermit,	1
who	1
they	1
say	1
was	1
a	1
soldier,	1
and	1
who	1
has	1
the	1
reputation	1
of	1
being	1
a	1
good	1
Christian	1
and	1
a	1
very	1
intelligent	1
and	1
charitable	1
man.	1
Close	1
to	1
the	1
hermitage	1
he	1
has	1
a	1
small	1
house	1
which	1
he	1
built	1
at	1
his	1
own	1
cost,	1
but	1
though	1
small	1
it	1
is	1
large	1
enough	1
for	1
the	1
reception	1
of	1
guests.”	1
“Has	1
this	1
hermit	1
any	1
hens,	1
do	1
you	1
think?”	1
asked	1
Sancho.	1
“Few	1
hermits	1
are	1
without	1
them,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
“for	1
those	1
we	1
see	1
now-a-days	1
are	1
not	1
like	1
the	1
hermits	1
of	1
the	1
Egyptian	1
deserts	1
who	1
were	1
clad	1
in	1
palm-leaves,	1
and	1
lived	1
on	1
the	1
roots	1
of	1
the	1
earth.	1
But	1
do	1
not	1
think	1
that	1
by	1
praising	1
these	1
I	1
am	1
disparaging	1
the	1
others;	1
all	1
I	1
mean	1
to	1
say	1
is	1
that	1
the	1
penances	1
of	1
those	1
of	1
the	1
present	1
day	1
do	1
not	1
come	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
asceticism	1
and	1
austerity	1
of	1
former	1
times;	1
but	1
it	1
does	1
not	1
follow	1
from	1
this	1
that	1
they	1
are	1
not	1
all	1
worthy;	1
at	1
least	1
I	1
think	1
them	1
so;	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
worst	1
the	1
hypocrite	1
who	1
pretends	1
to	1
be	1
good	1
does	1
less	1
harm	1
than	1
the	1
open	1
sinner.”	1
At	1
this	1
point	1
they	1
saw	1
approaching	1
the	1
spot	1
where	1
they	1
stood	1
a	1
man	1
on	1
foot,	1
proceeding	1
at	1
a	1
rapid	1
pace,	1
and	1
beating	1
a	1
mule	1
loaded	1
with	1
lances	1
and	1
halberds.	1
When	1
he	1
came	1
up	1
to	1
them,	1
he	1
saluted	1
them	1
and	1
passed	1
on	1
without	1
stopping.	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
called	1
to	1
him,	1
“Stay,	1
good	1
fellow;	1
you	1
seem	1
to	1
be	1
making	1
more	1
haste	1
than	1
suits	1
that	1
mule.”	1
“I	1
cannot	1
stop,	1
señor,”	1
answered	1
the	1
man;	1
“for	1
the	1
arms	1
you	1
see	1
I	1
carry	1
here	1
are	1
to	1
be	1
used	1
to-morrow,	1
so	1
I	1
must	1
not	1
delay;	1
God	1
be	1
with	1
you.	1
But	1
if	1
you	1
want	1
to	1
know	1
what	1
I	1
am	1
carrying	1
them	1
for,	1
I	1
mean	1
to	1
lodge	1
to-night	1
at	1
the	1
inn	1
that	1
is	1
beyond	1
the	1
hermitage,	1
and	1
if	1
you	1
be	1
going	1
the	1
same	1
road	1
you	1
will	1
find	1
me	1
there,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
tell	1
you	1
some	1
curious	1
things;	1
once	1
more	1
God	1
be	1
with	1
you;”	1
and	1
he	1
urged	1
on	1
his	1
mule	1
at	1
such	1
a	1
pace	1
that	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
had	1
no	1
time	1
to	1
ask	1
him	1
what	1
these	1
curious	1
things	1
were	1
that	1
he	1
meant	1
to	1
tell	1
them;	1
and	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
somewhat	1
inquisitive,	1
and	1
always	1
tortured	1
by	1
his	1
anxiety	1
to	1
learn	1
something	1
new,	1
he	1
decided	1
to	1
set	1
out	1
at	1
once,	1
and	1
go	1
and	1
pass	1
the	1
night	1
at	1
the	1
inn	1
instead	1
of	1
stopping	1
at	1
the	1
hermitage,	1
where	1
the	1
cousin	1
would	1
have	1
had	1
them	1
halt.	1
Accordingly	1
they	1
mounted	1
and	1
all	1
three	1
took	1
the	1
direct	1
road	1
for	1
the	1
inn,	1
which	1
they	1
reached	1
a	1
little	1
before	1
nightfall.	1
On	1
the	1
road	1
the	1
cousin	1
proposed	1
they	1
should	1
go	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
hermitage	1
to	1
drink	1
a	1
sup.	1
The	1
instant	1
Sancho	1
heard	1
this	1
he	1
steered	1
his	1
Dapple	1
towards	1
it,	1
and	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
and	1
the	1
cousin	1
did	1
the	1
same;	1
but	1
it	1
seems	1
Sancho’s	1
bad	1
luck	1
so	1
ordered	1
it	1
that	1
the	1
hermit	1
was	1
not	1
at	1
home,	1
for	1
so	1
a	1
sub-hermit	1
they	1
found	1
in	1
the	1
hermitage	1
told	1
them.	1
They	1
called	1
for	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
best.	1
She	1
replied	1
that	1
her	1
master	1
had	1
none,	1
but	1
that	1
if	1
they	1
liked	1
cheap	1
water	1
she	1
would	1
give	1
it	1
with	1
great	1
pleasure.	1
“If	1
I	1
found	1
any	1
in	1
water,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“there	1
are	1
wells	1
along	1
the	1
road	1
where	1
I	1
could	1
have	1
had	1
enough	1
of	1
it.	1
Ah,	1
Camacho’s	1
wedding,	1
and	1
plentiful	1
house	1
of	1
Don	1
Diego,	1
how	1
often	1
do	1
I	1
miss	1
you!”	1
Leaving	1
the	1
hermitage,	1
they	1
pushed	1
on	1
towards	1
the	1
inn,	1
and	1
a	1
little	1
farther	1
they	1
came	1
upon	1
a	1
youth	1
who	1
was	1
pacing	1
along	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
them	1
at	1
no	1
great	1
speed,	1
so	1
that	1
they	1
overtook	1
him.	1
He	1
carried	1
a	1
sword	1
over	1
his	1
shoulder,	1
and	1
slung	1
on	1
it	1
a	1
budget	1
or	1
bundle	1
of	1
his	1
clothes	1
apparently,	1
probably	1
his	1
breeches	1
or	1
pantaloons,	1
and	1
his	1
cloak	1
and	1
a	1
shirt	1
or	1
two;	1
for	1
he	1
had	1
on	1
a	1
short	1
jacket	1
of	1
velvet	1
with	1
a	1
gloss	1
like	1
satin	1
on	1
it	1
in	1
places,	1
and	1
had	1
his	1
shirt	1
out;	1
his	1
stockings	1
were	1
of	1
silk,	1
and	1
his	1
shoes	1
square-toed	1
as	1
they	1
wear	1
them	1
at	1
court.	1
His	1
age	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
eighteen	1
or	1
nineteen;	1
he	1
was	1
of	1
a	1
merry	1
countenance,	1
and	1
to	1
all	1
appearance	1
of	1
an	1
active	1
habit,	1
and	1
he	1
went	1
along	1
singing	1
seguidillas	1
to	1
beguile	1
the	1
wearisomeness	1
of	1
the	1
road.	1
As	1
they	1
came	1
up	1
with	1
him	1
he	1
was	1
just	1
finishing	1
one,	1
which	1
the	1
cousin	1
got	1
by	1
heart	1
and	1
they	1
say	1
ran	1
thus—	1
I’m	1
off	1
to	1
the	1
wars	1
For	1
the	1
want	1
of	1
pence,	1
Oh,	1
had	1
I	1
but	1
money	1
I’d	1
show	1
more	1
sense.	1
The	1
first	1
to	1
address	1
him	1
was	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
who	1
said,	1
“You	1
travel	1
very	1
airily,	1
sir	1
gallant;	1
whither	1
bound,	1
may	1
we	1
ask,	1
if	1
it	1
is	1
your	1
pleasure	1
to	1
tell	1
us?”	1
To	1
which	1
the	1
youth	1
replied,	1
“The	1
heat	1
and	1
my	1
poverty	1
are	1
the	1
reason	1
of	1
my	1
travelling	1
so	1
airily,	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
to	1
the	1
wars	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
bound.”	1
“How	1
poverty?”	1
asked	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
“the	1
heat	1
one	1
can	1
understand.”	1
“Señor,”	1
replied	1
the	1
youth,	1
“in	1
this	1
bundle	1
I	1
carry	1
velvet	1
pantaloons	1
to	1
match	1
this	1
jacket;	1
if	1
I	1
wear	1
them	1
out	1
on	1
the	1
road,	1
I	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
decent	1
appearance	1
in	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
city,	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
the	1
wherewithal	1
to	1
buy	1
others;	1
and	1
so	1
for	1
this	1
reason,	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
to	1
keep	1
myself	1
cool,	1
I	1
am	1
making	1
my	1
way	1
in	1
this	1
fashion	1
to	1
overtake	1
some	1
companies	1
of	1
infantry	1
that	1
are	1
not	1
twelve	1
leagues	1
off,	1
in	1
which	1
I	1
shall	1
enlist,	1
and	1
there	1
will	1
be	1
no	1
want	1
of	1
baggage	1
trains	1
to	1
travel	1
with	1
after	1
that	1
to	1
the	1
place	1
of	1
embarkation,	1
which	1
they	1
say	1
will	1
be	1
Carthagena;	1
I	1
would	1
rather	1
have	1
the	1
King	1
for	1
a	1
master,	1
and	1
serve	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
wars,	1
than	1
serve	1
a	1
court	1
pauper.”	1
“And	1
did	1
you	1
get	1
any	1
bounty,	1
now?”	1
asked	1
the	1
cousin.	1
“If	1
I	1
had	1
been	1
in	1
the	1
service	1
of	1
some	1
grandee	1
of	1
Spain	1
or	1
personage	1
of	1
distinction,”	1
replied	1
the	1
youth,	1
“I	1
should	1
have	1
been	1
safe	1
to	1
get	1
it;	1
for	1
that	1
is	1
the	1
advantage	1
of	1
serving	1
good	1
masters,	1
that	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
servants’	1
hall	1
men	1
come	1
to	1
be	1
ancients	1
or	1
captains,	1
or	1
get	1
a	1
good	1
pension.	1
But	1
I,	1
to	1
my	1
misfortune,	1
always	1
served	1
place-hunters	1
and	1
adventurers,	1
whose	1
keep	1
and	1
wages	1
were	1
so	1
miserable	1
and	1
scanty	1
that	1
half	1
went	1
in	1
paying	1
for	1
the	1
starching	1
of	1
one’s	1
collars;	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
miracle	1
indeed	1
if	1
a	1
page	1
volunteer	1
ever	1
got	1
anything	1
like	1
a	1
reasonable	1
bounty.”	1
“And	1
tell	1
me,	1
for	1
heaven’s	1
sake,”	1
asked	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“is	1
it	1
possible,	1
my	1
friend,	1
that	1
all	1
the	1
time	1
you	1
served	1
you	1
never	1
got	1
any	1
livery?”	1
“They	1
gave	1
me	1
two,”	1
replied	1
the	1
page;	1
“but	1
just	1
as	1
when	1
one	1
quits	1
a	1
religious	1
community	1
before	1
making	1
profession,	1
they	1
strip	1
him	1
of	1
the	1
dress	1
of	1
the	1
order	1
and	1
give	1
him	1
back	1
his	1
own	1
clothes,	1
so	1
did	1
my	1
masters	1
return	1
me	1
mine;	1
for	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
the	1
business	1
on	1
which	1
they	1
came	1
to	1
court	1
was	1
finished,	1
they	1
went	1
home	1
and	1
took	1
back	1
the	1
liveries	1
they	1
had	1
given	1
merely	1
for	1
show.”	1
“What	1
spilorceria!—as	1
an	1
Italian	1
would	1
say,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
“but	1
for	1
all	1
that,	1
consider	1
yourself	1
happy	1
in	1
having	1
left	1
court	1
with	1
as	1
worthy	1
an	1
object	1
as	1
you	1
have,	1
for	1
there	1
is	1
nothing	1
on	1
earth	1
more	1
honourable	1
or	1
profitable	1
than	1
serving,	1
first	1
of	1
all	1
God,	1
and	1
then	1
one’s	1
king	1
and	1
natural	1
lord,	1
particularly	1
in	1
the	1
profession	1
of	1
arms,	1
by	1
which,	1
if	1
not	1
more	1
wealth,	1
at	1
least	1
more	1
honour	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
won	1
than	1
by	1
letters,	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
said	1
many	1
a	1
time;	1
for	1
though	1
letters	1
may	1
have	1
founded	1
more	1
great	1
houses	1
than	1
arms,	1
still	1
those	1
founded	1
by	1
arms	1
have	1
I	1
know	1
not	1
what	1
superiority	1
over	1
those	1
founded	1
by	1
letters,	1
and	1
a	1
certain	1
splendour	1
belonging	1
to	1
them	1
that	1
distinguishes	1
them	1
above	1
all.	1
And	1
bear	1
in	1
mind	1
what	1
I	1
am	1
now	1
about	1
to	1
say	1
to	1
you,	1
for	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
of	1
great	1
use	1
and	1
comfort	1
to	1
you	1
in	1
time	1
of	1
trouble;	1
it	1
is,	1
not	1
to	1
let	1
your	1
mind	1
dwell	1
on	1
the	1
adverse	1
chances	1
that	1
may	1
befall	1
you;	1
for	1
the	1
worst	1
of	1
all	1
is	1
death,	1
and	1
if	1
it	1
be	1
a	1
good	1
death,	1
the	1
best	1
of	1
all	1
is	1
to	1
die.	1
They	1
asked	1
Julius	1
Cæsar,	1
the	1
valiant	1
Roman	1
emperor,	1
what	1
was	1
the	1
best	1
death.	1
He	1
answered,	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
unexpected,	1
which	1
comes	1
suddenly	1
and	1
unforeseen;	1
and	1
though	1
he	1
answered	1
like	1
a	1
pagan,	1
and	1
one	1
without	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
the	1
true	1
God,	1
yet,	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
sparing	1
our	1
feelings	1
is	1
concerned,	1
he	1
was	1
right;	1
for	1
suppose	1
you	1
are	1
killed	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
engagement	1
or	1
skirmish,	1
whether	1
by	1
a	1
cannon	1
ball	1
or	1
blown	1
up	1
by	1
mine,	1
what	1
matters	1
it?	1
It	1
is	1
only	1
dying,	1
and	1
all	1
is	1
over;	1
and	1
according	1
to	1
Terence,	1
a	1
soldier	1
shows	1
better	1
dead	1
in	1
battle,	1
than	1
alive	1
and	1
safe	1
in	1
flight;	1
and	1
the	1
good	1
soldier	1
wins	1
fame	1
in	1
proportion	1
as	1
he	1
is	1
obedient	1
to	1
his	1
captains	1
and	1
those	1
in	1
command	1
over	1
him.	1
And	1
remember,	1
my	1
son,	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
better	1
for	1
the	1
soldier	1
to	1
smell	1
of	1
gunpowder	1
than	1
of	1
civet,	1
and	1
that	1
if	1
old	1
age	1
should	1
come	1
upon	1
you	1
in	1
this	1
honourable	1
calling,	1
though	1
you	1
may	1
be	1
covered	1
with	1
wounds	1
and	1
crippled	1
and	1
lame,	1
it	1
will	1
not	1
come	1
upon	1
you	1
without	1
honour,	1
and	1
that	1
such	1
as	1
poverty	1
cannot	1
lessen;	1
especially	1
now	1
that	1
provisions	1
are	1
being	1
made	1
for	1
supporting	1
and	1
relieving	1
old	1
and	1
disabled	1
soldiers;	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
right	1
to	1
deal	1
with	1
them	1
after	1
the	1
fashion	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
set	1
free	1
and	1
get	1
rid	1
of	1
their	1
black	1
slaves	1
when	1
they	1
are	1
old	1
and	1
useless,	1
and,	1
turning	1
them	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
houses	1
under	1
the	1
pretence	1
of	1
making	1
them	1
free,	1
make	1
them	1
slaves	1
to	1
hunger,	1
from	1
which	1
they	1
cannot	1
expect	1
to	1
be	1
released	1
except	1
by	1
death.	1
But	1
for	1
the	1
present	1
I	1
won’t	1
say	1
more	1
than	1
get	1
ye	1
up	1
behind	1
me	1
on	1
my	1
horse	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
the	1
inn,	1
and	1
sup	1
with	1
me	1
there,	1
and	1
to-morrow	1
you	1
shall	1
pursue	1
your	1
journey,	1
and	1
God	1
give	1
you	1
as	1
good	1
speed	1
as	1
your	1
intentions	1
deserve.”	1
The	1
page	1
did	1
not	1
accept	1
the	1
invitation	1
to	1
mount,	1
though	1
he	1
did	1
that	1
to	1
supper	1
at	1
the	1
inn;	1
and	1
here	1
they	1
say	1
Sancho	1
said	1
to	1
himself,	1
“God	1
be	1
with	1
you	1
for	1
a	1
master;	1
is	1
it	1
possible	1
that	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
can	1
say	1
things	1
so	1
many	1
and	1
so	1
good	1
as	1
he	1
has	1
said	1
just	1
now,	1
can	1
say	1
that	1
he	1
saw	1
the	1
impossible	1
absurdities	1
he	1
reports	1
about	1
the	1
cave	1
of	1
Montesinos?	1
Well,	1
well,	1
we	1
shall	1
see.”	1
And	1
now,	1
just	1
as	1
night	1
was	1
falling,	1
they	1
reached	1
the	1
inn,	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
without	1
satisfaction	1
that	1
Sancho	1
perceived	1
his	1
master	1
took	1
it	1
for	1
a	1
real	1
inn,	1
and	1
not	1
for	1
a	1
castle	1
as	1
usual.	1
The	1
instant	1
they	1
entered	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
asked	1
the	1
landlord	1
after	1
the	1
man	1
with	1
the	1
lances	1
and	1
halberds,	1
and	1
was	1
told	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
stable	1
seeing	1
to	1
his	1
mule;	1
which	1
was	1
what	1
Sancho	1
and	1
the	1
cousin	1
proceeded	1
to	1
do	1
for	1
their	1
beasts,	1
giving	1
the	1
best	1
manger	1
and	1
the	1
best	1
place	1
in	1
the	1
stable	1
to	1
Rocinante.	1

Don	1
Quixote’s	1
bread	1
would	1
not	1
bake,	1
as	1
the	1
common	1
saying	1
is,	1
until	1
he	1
had	1
heard	1
and	1
learned	1
the	1
curious	1
things	1
promised	1
by	1
the	1
man	1
who	1
carried	1
the	1
arms.	1
He	1
went	1
to	1
seek	1
him	1
where	1
the	1
innkeeper	1
said	1
he	1
was	1
and	1
having	1
found	1
him,	1
bade	1
him	1
say	1
now	1
at	1
any	1
rate	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
say	1
in	1
answer	1
to	1
the	1
question	1
he	1
had	1
asked	1
him	1
on	1
the	1
road.	1
“The	1
tale	1
of	1
my	1
wonders	1
must	1
be	1
taken	1
more	1
leisurely	1
and	1
not	1
standing,”	1
said	1
the	1
man;	1
“let	1
me	1
finish	1
foddering	1
my	1
beast,	1
good	1
sir;	1
and	1
then	1
I’ll	1
tell	1
you	1
things	1
that	1
will	1
astonish	1
you.”	1
“Don’t	1
wait	1
for	1
that,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
“I’ll	1
help	1
you	1
in	1
everything,”	1
and	1
so	1
he	1
did,	1
sifting	1
the	1
barley	1
for	1
him	1
and	1
cleaning	1
out	1
the	1
manger;	1
a	1
degree	1
of	1
humility	1
which	1
made	1
the	1
other	1
feel	1
bound	1
to	1
tell	1
him	1
with	1
a	1
good	1
grace	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
asked;	1
so	1
seating	1
himself	1
on	1
a	1
bench,	1
with	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
beside	1
him,	1
and	1
the	1
cousin,	1
the	1
page,	1
Sancho	1
Panza,	1
and	1
the	1
landlord,	1
for	1
a	1
senate	1
and	1
an	1
audience,	1
he	1
began	1
his	1
story	1
in	1
this	1
way:	1
“You	1
must	1
know	1
that	1
in	1
a	1
village	1
four	1
leagues	1
and	1
a	1
half	1
from	1
this	1
inn,	1
it	1
so	1
happened	1
that	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
regidors,	1
by	1
the	1
tricks	1
and	1
roguery	1
of	1
a	1
servant	1
girl	1
of	1
his	1
(it’s	1
too	1
long	1
a	1
tale	1
to	1
tell),	1
lost	1
an	1
ass;	1
and	1
though	1
he	1
did	1
all	1
he	1
possibly	1
could	1
to	1
find	1
it,	1
it	1
was	1
all	1
to	1
no	1
purpose.	1
A	1
fortnight	1
might	1
have	1
gone	1
by,	1
so	1
the	1
story	1
goes,	1
since	1
the	1
ass	1
had	1
been	1
missing,	1
when,	1
as	1
the	1
regidor	1
who	1
had	1
lost	1
it	1
was	1
standing	1
in	1
the	1
plaza,	1
another	1
regidor	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
town	1
said	1
to	1
him,	1
‘Pay	1
me	1
for	1
good	1
news,	1
gossip;	1
your	1
ass	1
has	1
turned	1
up.’	1
‘That	1
I	1
will,	1
and	1
well,	1
gossip,’	1
said	1
the	1
other;	1
‘but	1
tell	1
us,	1
where	1
has	1
he	1
turned	1
up?’	1
‘In	1
the	1
forest,’	1
said	1
the	1
finder;	1
‘I	1
saw	1
him	1
this	1
morning	1
without	1
pack-saddle	1
or	1
harness	1
of	1
any	1
sort,	1
and	1
so	1
lean	1
that	1
it	1
went	1
to	1
one’s	1
heart	1
to	1
see	1
him.	1
I	1
tried	1
to	1
drive	1
him	1
before	1
me	1
and	1
bring	1
him	1
to	1
you,	1
but	1
he	1
is	1
already	1
so	1
wild	1
and	1
shy	1
that	1
when	1
I	1
went	1
near	1
him	1
he	1
made	1
off	1
into	1
the	1
thickest	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
forest.	1
If	1
you	1
have	1
a	1
mind	1
that	1
we	1
two	1
should	1
go	1
back	1
and	1
look	1
for	1
him,	1
let	1
me	1
put	1
up	1
this	1
she-ass	1
at	1
my	1
house	1
and	1
I’ll	1
be	1
back	1
at	1
once.’	1
‘You	1
will	1
be	1
doing	1
me	1
a	1
great	1
kindness,’	1
said	1
the	1
owner	1
of	1
the	1
ass,	1
‘and	1
I’ll	1
try	1
to	1
pay	1
it	1
back	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
coin.’	1
It	1
is	1
with	1
all	1
these	1
circumstances,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
very	1
same	1
way	1
I	1
am	1
telling	1
it	1
now,	1
that	1
those	1
who	1
know	1
all	1
about	1
the	1
matter	1
tell	1
the	1
story.	1
Well	1
then,	1
the	1
two	1
regidors	1
set	1
off	1
on	1
foot,	1
arm	1
in	1
arm,	1
for	1
the	1
forest,	1
and	1
coming	1
to	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
they	1
hoped	1
to	1
find	1
the	1
ass	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
find	1
him,	1
nor	1
was	1
he	1
to	1
be	1
seen	1
anywhere	1
about,	1
search	1
as	1
they	1
might.	1
Seeing,	1
then,	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
sign	1
of	1
him,	1
the	1
regidor	1
who	1
had	1
seen	1
him	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
other,	1
‘Look	1
here,	1
gossip;	1
a	1
plan	1
has	1
occurred	1
to	1
me,	1
by	1
which,	1
beyond	1
a	1
doubt,	1
we	1
shall	1
manage	1
to	1
discover	1
the	1
animal,	1
even	1
if	1
he	1
is	1
stowed	1
away	1
in	1
the	1
bowels	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
not	1
to	1
say	1
the	1
forest.	1
Here	1
it	1
is.	1
I	1
can	1
bray	1
to	1
perfection,	1
and	1
if	1
you	1
can	1
ever	1
so	1
little,	1
the	1
thing’s	1
as	1
good	1
as	1
done.’	1
‘Ever	1
so	1
little	1
did	1
you	1
say,	1
gossip?’	1
said	1
the	1
other;	1
‘by	1
God,	1
I’ll	1
not	1
give	1
in	1
to	1
anybody,	1
not	1
even	1
to	1
the	1
asses	1
themselves.’	1
‘We’ll	1
soon	1
see,’	1
said	1
the	1
second	1
regidor,	1
‘for	1
my	1
plan	1
is	1
that	1
you	1
should	1
go	1
one	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
forest,	1
and	1
I	1
the	1
other,	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
go	1
all	1
round	1
about	1
it;	1
and	1
every	1
now	1
and	1
then	1
you	1
will	1
bray	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
bray;	1
and	1
it	1
cannot	1
be	1
but	1
that	1
the	1
ass	1
will	1
hear	1
us,	1
and	1
answer	1
us	1
if	1
he	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
forest.’	1
To	1
which	1
the	1
owner	1
of	1
the	1
ass	1
replied,	1
‘It’s	1
an	1
excellent	1
plan,	1
I	1
declare,	1
gossip,	1
and	1
worthy	1
of	1
your	1
great	1
genius;’	1
and	1
the	1
two	1
separating	1
as	1
agreed,	1
it	1
so	1
fell	1
out	1
that	1
they	1
brayed	1
almost	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
moment,	1
and	1
each,	1
deceived	1
by	1
the	1
braying	1
of	1
the	1
other,	1
ran	1
to	1
look,	1
fancying	1
the	1
ass	1
had	1
turned	1
up	1
at	1
last.	1
When	1
they	1
came	1
in	1
sight	1
of	1
one	1
another,	1
said	1
the	1
loser,	1
‘Is	1
it	1
possible,	1
gossip,	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
my	1
ass	1
that	1
brayed?’	1
‘No,	1
it	1
was	1
I,’	1
said	1
the	1
other.	1
‘Well	1
then,	1
I	1
can	1
tell	1
you,	1
gossip,’	1
said	1
the	1
ass’s	1
owner,	1
‘that	1
between	1
you	1
and	1
an	1
ass	1
there	1
is	1
not	1
an	1
atom	1
of	1
difference	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
braying	1
goes,	1
for	1
I	1
never	1
in	1
all	1
my	1
life	1
saw	1
or	1
heard	1
anything	1
more	1
natural.’	1
‘Those	1
praises	1
and	1
compliments	1
belong	1
to	1
you	1
more	1
justly	1
than	1
to	1
me,	1
gossip,’	1
said	1
the	1
inventor	1
of	1
the	1
plan;	1
‘for,	1
by	1
the	1
God	1
that	1
made	1
me,	1
you	1
might	1
give	1
a	1
couple	1
of	1
brays	1
odds	1
to	1
the	1
best	1
and	1
most	1
finished	1
brayer	1
in	1
the	1
world;	1
the	1
tone	1
you	1
have	1
got	1
is	1
deep,	1
your	1
voice	1
is	1
well	1
kept	1
up	1
as	1
to	1
time	1
and	1
pitch,	1
and	1
your	1
finishing	1
notes	1
come	1
thick	1
and	1
fast;	1
in	1
fact,	1
I	1
own	1
myself	1
beaten,	1
and	1
yield	1
the	1
palm	1
to	1
you,	1
and	1
give	1
in	1
to	1
you	1
in	1
this	1
rare	1
accomplishment.’	1
‘Well	1
then,’	1
said	1
the	1
owner,	1
‘I’ll	1
set	1
a	1
higher	1
value	1
on	1
myself	1
for	1
the	1
future,	1
and	1
consider	1
that	1
I	1
know	1
something,	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
an	1
excellence	1
of	1
some	1
sort;	1
for	1
though	1
I	1
always	1
thought	1
I	1
brayed	1
well,	1
I	1
never	1
supposed	1
I	1
came	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
pitch	1
of	1
perfection	1
you	1
say.’	1
‘And	1
I	1
say	1
too,’	1
said	1
the	1
second,	1
‘that	1
there	1
are	1
rare	1
gifts	1
going	1
to	1
loss	1
in	1
the	1
world,	1
and	1
that	1
they	1
are	1
ill	1
bestowed	1
upon	1
those	1
who	1
don’t	1
know	1
how	1
to	1
make	1
use	1
of	1
them.’	1
‘Ours,’	1
said	1
the	1
owner	1
of	1
the	1
ass,	1
‘unless	1
it	1
is	1
in	1
cases	1
like	1
this	1
we	1
have	1
now	1
in	1
hand,	1
cannot	1
be	1
of	1
any	1
service	1
to	1
us,	1
and	1
even	1
in	1
this	1
God	1
grant	1
they	1
may	1
be	1
of	1
some	1
use.’	1
So	1
saying	1
they	1
separated,	1
and	1
took	1
to	1
their	1
braying	1
once	1
more,	1
but	1
every	1
instant	1
they	1
were	1
deceiving	1
one	1
another,	1
and	1
coming	1
to	1
meet	1
one	1
another	1
again,	1
until	1
they	1
arranged	1
by	1
way	1
of	1
countersign,	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
know	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
they	1
and	1
not	1
the	1
ass,	1
to	1
give	1
two	1
brays,	1
one	1
after	1
the	1
other.	1
In	1
this	1
way,	1
doubling	1
the	1
brays	1
at	1
every	1
step,	1
they	1
made	1
the	1
complete	1
circuit	1
of	1
the	1
forest,	1
but	1
the	1
lost	1
ass	1
never	1
gave	1
them	1
an	1
answer	1
or	1
even	1
the	1
sign	1
of	1
one.	1
How	1
could	1
the	1
poor	1
ill-starred	1
brute	1
have	1
answered,	1
when,	1
in	1
the	1
thickest	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
forest,	1
they	1
found	1
him	1
devoured	1
by	1
wolves?	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
saw	1
him	1
his	1
owner	1
said,	1
‘I	1
was	1
wondering	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
answer,	1
for	1
if	1
he	1
wasn’t	1
dead	1
he’d	1
have	1
brayed	1
when	1
he	1
heard	1
us,	1
or	1
he’d	1
have	1
been	1
no	1
ass;	1
but	1
for	1
the	1
sake	1
of	1
having	1
heard	1
you	1
bray	1
to	1
such	1
perfection,	1
gossip,	1
I	1
count	1
the	1
trouble	1
I	1
have	1
taken	1
to	1
look	1
for	1
him	1
well	1
bestowed,	1
even	1
though	1
I	1
have	1
found	1
him	1
dead.’	1
‘It’s	1
in	1
a	1
good	1
hand,	1
gossip,’	1
said	1
the	1
other;	1
‘if	1
the	1
abbot	1
sings	1
well,	1
the	1
acolyte	1
is	1
not	1
much	1
behind	1
him.’	1
So	1
they	1
returned	1
disconsolate	1
and	1
hoarse	1
to	1
their	1
village,	1
where	1
they	1
told	1
their	1
friends,	1
neighbours,	1
and	1
acquaintances	1
what	1
had	1
befallen	1
them	1
in	1
their	1
search	1
for	1
the	1
ass,	1
each	1
crying	1
up	1
the	1
other’s	1
perfection	1
in	1
braying.	1
The	1
whole	1
story	1
came	1
to	1
be	1
known	1
and	1
spread	1
abroad	1
through	1
the	1
villages	1
of	1
the	1
neighbourhood;	1
and	1
the	1
devil,	1
who	1
never	1
sleeps,	1
with	1
his	1
love	1
for	1
sowing	1
dissensions	1
and	1
scattering	1
discord	1
everywhere,	1
blowing	1
mischief	1
about	1
and	1
making	1
quarrels	1
out	1
of	1
nothing,	1
contrived	1
to	1
make	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
other	1
towns	1
fall	1
to	1
braying	1
whenever	1
they	1
saw	1
anyone	1
from	1
our	1
village,	1
as	1
if	1
to	1
throw	1
the	1
braying	1
of	1
our	1
regidors	1
in	1
our	1
teeth.	1
Then	1
the	1
boys	1
took	1
to	1
it,	1
which	1
was	1
the	1
same	1
thing	1
for	1
it	1
as	1
getting	1
into	1
the	1
hands	1
and	1
mouths	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
devils	1
of	1
hell;	1
and	1
braying	1
spread	1
from	1
one	1
town	1
to	1
another	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
way	1
that	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
the	1
braying	1
town	1
are	1
as	1
easy	1
to	1
be	1
known	1
as	1
blacks	1
are	1
to	1
be	1
known	1
from	1
whites,	1
and	1
the	1
unlucky	1
joke	1
has	1
gone	1
so	1
far	1
that	1
several	1
times	1
the	1
scoffed	1
have	1
come	1
out	1
in	1
arms	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
body	1
to	1
do	1
battle	1
with	1
the	1
scoffers,	1
and	1
neither	1
king	1
nor	1
rook,	1
fear	1
nor	1
shame,	1
can	1
mend	1
matters.	1
To-morrow	1
or	1
the	1
day	1
after,	1
I	1
believe,	1
the	1
men	1
of	1
my	1
town,	1
that	1
is,	1
of	1
the	1
braying	1
town,	1
are	1
going	1
to	1
take	1
the	1
field	1
against	1
another	1
village	1
two	1
leagues	1
away	1
from	1
ours,	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
that	1
persecute	1
us	1
most;	1
and	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
turn	1
out	1
well	1
prepared	1
I	1
have	1
bought	1
these	1
lances	1
and	1
halberds	1
you	1
have	1
seen.	1
These	1
are	1
the	1
curious	1
things	1
I	1
told	1
you	1
I	1
had	1
to	1
tell,	1
and	1
if	1
you	1
don’t	1
think	1
them	1
so,	1
I	1
have	1
got	1
no	1
others;”	1
and	1
with	1
this	1
the	1
worthy	1
fellow	1
brought	1
his	1
story	1
to	1
a	1
close.	1
Just	1
at	1
this	1
moment	1
there	1
came	1
in	1
at	1
the	1
gate	1
of	1
the	1
inn	1
a	1
man	1
entirely	1
clad	1
in	1
chamois	1
leather,	1
hose,	1
breeches,	1
and	1
doublet,	1
who	1
said	1
in	1
a	1
loud	1
voice,	1
“Señor	1
host,	1
have	1
you	1
room?	1
Here’s	1
the	1
divining	1
ape	1
and	1
the	1
show	1
of	1
the	1
Release	1
of	1
Melisendra	1
just	1
coming.”	1
“Ods	1
body!”	1
said	1
the	1
landlord,	1
“why,	1
it’s	1
Master	1
Pedro!	1
We’re	1
in	1
for	1
a	1
grand	1
night!”	1
I	1
forgot	1
to	1
mention	1
that	1
the	1
said	1
Master	1
Pedro	1
had	1
his	1
left	1
eye	1
and	1
nearly	1
half	1
his	1
cheek	1
covered	1
with	1
a	1
patch	1
of	1
green	1
taffety,	1
showing	1
that	1
something	1
ailed	1
all	1
that	1
side.	1
“Your	1
worship	1
is	1
welcome,	1
Master	1
Pedro,”	1
continued	1
the	1
landlord;	1
“but	1
where	1
are	1
the	1
ape	1
and	1
the	1
show,	1
for	1
I	1
don’t	1
see	1
them?”	1
“They	1
are	1
close	1
at	1
hand,”	1
said	1
he	1
in	1
the	1
chamois	1
leather,	1
“but	1
I	1
came	1
on	1
first	1
to	1
know	1
if	1
there	1
was	1
any	1
room.”	1
“I’d	1
make	1
the	1
Duke	1
of	1
Alva	1
himself	1
clear	1
out	1
to	1
make	1
room	1
for	1
Master	1
Pedro,”	1
said	1
the	1
landlord;	1
“bring	1
in	1
the	1
ape	1
and	1
the	1
show;	1
there’s	1
company	1
in	1
the	1
inn	1
to-night	1
that	1
will	1
pay	1
to	1
see	1
that	1
and	1
the	1
cleverness	1
of	1
the	1
ape.”	1
“So	1
be	1
it	1
by	1
all	1
means,”	1
said	1
the	1
man	1
with	1
the	1
patch;	1
“I’ll	1
lower	1
the	1
price,	1
and	1
be	1
well	1
satisfied	1
if	1
I	1
only	1
pay	1
my	1
expenses;	1
and	1
now	1
I’ll	1
go	1
back	1
and	1
hurry	1
on	1
the	1
cart	1
with	1
the	1
ape	1
and	1
the	1
show;”	1
and	1
with	1
this	1
he	1
went	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
inn.	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
at	1
once	1
asked	1
the	1
landlord	1
what	1
this	1
Master	1
Pedro	1
was,	1
and	1
what	1
was	1
the	1
show	1
and	1
what	1
was	1
the	1
ape	1
he	1
had	1
with	1
him;	1
which	1
the	1
landlord	1
replied,	1
“This	1
is	1
a	1
famous	1
puppet-showman,	1
who	1
for	1
some	1
time	1
past	1
has	1
been	1
going	1
about	1
this	1
Mancha	1
de	1
Aragon,	1
exhibiting	1
a	1
show	1
of	1
the	1
release	1
of	1
Melisendra	1
by	1
the	1
famous	1
Don	1
Gaiferos,	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
best	1
and	1
best-represented	1
stories	1
that	1
have	1
been	1
seen	1
in	1
this	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
kingdom	1
for	1
many	1
a	1
year;	1
he	1
has	1
also	1
with	1
him	1
an	1
ape	1
with	1
the	1
most	1
extraordinary	1
gift	1
ever	1
seen	1
in	1
an	1
ape	1
or	1
imagined	1
in	1
a	1
human	1
being;	1
for	1
if	1
you	1
ask	1
him	1
anything,	1
he	1
listens	1
attentively	1
to	1
the	1
question,	1
and	1
then	1
jumps	1
on	1
his	1
master’s	1
shoulder,	1
and	1
pressing	1
close	1
to	1
his	1
ear	1
tells	1
him	1
the	1
answer	1
which	1
Master	1
Pedro	1
then	1
delivers.	1
He	1
says	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
more	1
about	1
things	1
past	1
than	1
about	1
things	1
to	1
come;	1
and	1
though	1
he	1
does	1
not	1
always	1
hit	1
the	1
truth	1
in	1
every	1
case,	1
most	1
times	1
he	1
is	1
not	1
far	1
wrong,	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
makes	1
us	1
fancy	1
he	1
has	1
got	1
the	1
devil	1
in	1
him.	1
He	1
gets	1
two	1
reals	1
for	1
every	1
question	1
if	1
the	1
ape	1
answers;	1
I	1
mean	1
if	1
his	1
master	1
answers	1
for	1
him	1
after	1
he	1
has	1
whispered	1
into	1
his	1
ear;	1
and	1
so	1
it	1
is	1
believed	1
that	1
this	1
same	1
Master	1
Pedro	1
is	1
very	1
rich.	1
He	1
is	1
a	1
‘gallant	1
man’	1
as	1
they	1
say	1
in	1
Italy,	1
and	1
good	1
company,	1
and	1
leads	1
the	1
finest	1
life	1
in	1
the	1
world;	1
talks	1
more	1
than	1
six,	1
drinks	1
more	1
than	1
a	1
dozen,	1
and	1
all	1
by	1
his	1
tongue,	1
and	1
his	1
ape,	1
and	1
his	1
show.”	1
Master	1
Pedro	1
now	1
came	1
back,	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
cart	1
followed	1
the	1
show	1
and	1
the	1
ape—a	1
big	1
one,	1
without	1
a	1
tail	1
and	1
with	1
buttocks	1
as	1
bare	1
as	1
felt,	1
but	1
not	1
vicious-looking.	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
saw	1
him,	1
he	1
asked	1
him,	1
“Can	1
you	1
tell	1
me,	1
sir	1
fortune-teller,	1
what	1
fish	1
do	1
we	1
catch,	1
and	1
how	1
will	1
it	1
be	1
with	1
us?	1
See,	1
here	1
are	1
my	1
two	1
reals,”	1
and	1
he	1
bade	1
Sancho	1
give	1
them	1
to	1
Master	1
Pedro;	1
but	1
he	1
answered	1
for	1
the	1
ape	1
and	1
said,	1
“Señor,	1
this	1
animal	1
does	1
not	1
give	1
any	1
answer	1
or	1
information	1
touching	1
things	1
that	1
are	1
to	1
come;	1
of	1
things	1
past	1
he	1
knows	1
something,	1
and	1
more	1
or	1
less	1
of	1
things	1
present.”	1
“Gad,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“I	1
would	1
not	1
give	1
a	1
farthing	1
to	1
be	1
told	1
what’s	1
past	1
with	1
me,	1
for	1
who	1
knows	1
that	1
better	1
than	1
I	1
do	1
myself?	1
And	1
to	1
pay	1
for	1
being	1
told	1
what	1
I	1
know	1
would	1
be	1
mighty	1
foolish.	1
But	1
as	1
you	1
know	1
things	1
present,	1
here	1
are	1
my	1
two	1
reals,	1
and	1
tell	1
me,	1
most	1
excellent	1
sir	1
ape,	1
what	1
is	1
my	1
wife	1
Teresa	1
Panza	1
doing	1
now,	1
and	1
what	1
is	1
she	1
diverting	1
herself	1
with?”	1
Master	1
Pedro	1
refused	1
to	1
take	1
the	1
money,	1
saying,	1
“I	1
will	1
not	1
receive	1
payment	1
in	1
advance	1
or	1
until	1
the	1
service	1
has	1
been	1
first	1
rendered;”	1
and	1
then	1
with	1
his	1
right	1
hand	1
he	1
gave	1
a	1
couple	1
of	1
slaps	1
on	1
his	1
left	1
shoulder,	1
and	1
with	1
one	1
spring	1
the	1
ape	1
perched	1
himself	1
upon	1
it,	1
and	1
putting	1
his	1
mouth	1
to	1
his	1
master’s	1
ear	1
began	1
chattering	1
his	1
teeth	1
rapidly;	1
and	1
having	1
kept	1
this	1
up	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
one	1
would	1
be	1
saying	1
a	1
credo,	1
with	1
another	1
spring	1
he	1
brought	1
himself	1
to	1
the	1
ground,	1
and	1
the	1
same	1
instant	1
Master	1
Pedro	1
ran	1
in	1
great	1
haste	1
and	1
fell	1
upon	1
his	1
knees	1
before	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
and	1
embracing	1
his	1
legs	1
exclaimed,	1
“These	1
legs	1
do	1
I	1
embrace	1
as	1
I	1
would	1
embrace	1
the	1
two	1
pillars	1
of	1
Hercules,	1
O	1
illustrious	1
reviver	1
of	1
knight-errantry,	1
so	1
long	1
consigned	1
to	1
oblivion!	1
O	1
never	1
yet	1
duly	1
extolled	1
knight,	1

Don	1
Quixote	1
was	1
thunderstruck,	1
Sancho	1
astounded,	1
the	1
cousin	1
staggered,	1
the	1
page	1
astonished,	1
the	1
man	1
from	1
the	1
braying	1
town	1
agape,	1
the	1
landlord	1
in	1
perplexity,	1
and,	1
in	1
short,	1
everyone	1
amazed	1
at	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
puppet-showman,	1
who	1
went	1
on	1
to	1
say,	1
“And	1
thou,	1
worthy	1
Sancho	1
Panza,	1
the	1
best	1
squire	1
and	1
squire	1
to	1
the	1
best	1
knight	1
in	1
the	1
world!	1
Be	1
of	1
good	1
cheer,	1
for	1
thy	1
good	1
wife	1
Teresa	1
is	1
well,	1
and	1
she	1
is	1
at	1
this	1
moment	1
hackling	1
a	1
pound	1
of	1
flax;	1
and	1
more	1
by	1
token	1
she	1
has	1
at	1
her	1
left	1
hand	1
a	1
jug	1
with	1
a	1
broken	1
spout	1
that	1
holds	1
a	1
good	1
drop	1
of	1
wine,	1
with	1
which	1
she	1
solaces	1
herself	1
at	1
her	1
work.”	1
“That	1
I	1
can	1
well	1
believe,”	1
said	1
Sancho.	1
“She	1
is	1
a	1
lucky	1
one,	1
and	1
if	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
for	1
her	1
jealousy	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
change	1
her	1
for	1
the	1
giantess	1
Andandona,	1
who	1
by	1
my	1
master’s	1
account	1
was	1
a	1
very	1
clever	1
and	1
worthy	1
woman;	1
my	1
Teresa	1
is	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
that	1
won’t	1
let	1
themselves	1
want	1
for	1
anything,	1
though	1
their	1
heirs	1
may	1
have	1
to	1
pay	1
for	1
it.”	1
“Now	1
I	1
declare,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“he	1
who	1
reads	1
much	1
and	1
travels	1
much	1
sees	1
and	1
knows	1
a	1
great	1
deal.	1
I	1
say	1
so	1
because	1
what	1
amount	1
of	1
persuasion	1
could	1
have	1
persuaded	1
me	1
that	1
there	1
are	1
apes	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
that	1
can	1
divine	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
seen	1
now	1
with	1
my	1
own	1
eyes?	1
For	1
I	1
am	1
that	1
very	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
of	1
La	1
Mancha	1
this	1
worthy	1
animal	1
refers	1
to,	1
though	1
he	1
has	1
gone	1
rather	1
too	1
far	1
in	1
my	1
praise;	1
but	1
whatever	1
I	1
may	1
be,	1
I	1
thank	1
heaven	1
that	1
it	1
has	1
endowed	1
me	1
with	1
a	1
tender	1
and	1
compassionate	1
heart,	1
always	1
disposed	1
to	1
do	1
good	1
to	1
all	1
and	1
harm	1
to	1
none.”	1
“If	1
I	1
had	1
money,”	1
said	1
the	1
page,	1
“I	1
would	1
ask	1
señor	1
ape	1
what	1
will	1
happen	1
to	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
peregrination	1
I	1
am	1
making.”	1
To	1
this	1
Master	1
Pedro,	1
who	1
had	1
by	1
this	1
time	1
risen	1
from	1
Don	1
Quixote’s	1
feet,	1
replied,	1
“I	1
have	1
already	1
said	1
that	1
this	1
little	1
beast	1
gives	1
no	1
answer	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
future;	1
but	1
if	1
he	1
did,	1
not	1
having	1
money	1
would	1
be	1
of	1
no	1
consequence,	1
for	1
to	1
oblige	1
Señor	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
here	1
present,	1
I	1
would	1
give	1
up	1
all	1
the	1
profits	1
in	1
the	1
world.	1
And	1
now,	1
because	1
I	1
have	1
promised	1
it,	1
and	1
to	1
afford	1
him	1
pleasure,	1
I	1
will	1
set	1
up	1
my	1
show	1
and	1
offer	1
entertainment	1
to	1
all	1
who	1
are	1
in	1
the	1
inn,	1
without	1
any	1
charge	1
whatever.”	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
heard	1
this,	1
the	1
landlord,	1
delighted	1
beyond	1
measure,	1
pointed	1
out	1
a	1
place	1
where	1
the	1
show	1
might	1
be	1
fixed,	1
which	1
was	1
done	1
at	1
once.	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
was	1
not	1
very	1
well	1
satisfied	1
with	1
the	1
divinations	1
of	1
the	1
ape,	1
as	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
think	1
it	1
proper	1
that	1
an	1
ape	1
should	1
divine	1
anything,	1
either	1
past	1
or	1
future;	1
so	1
while	1
Master	1
Pedro	1
was	1
arranging	1
the	1
show,	1
he	1
retired	1
with	1
Sancho	1
into	1
a	1
corner	1
of	1
the	1
stable,	1
where,	1
without	1
being	1
overheard	1
by	1
anyone,	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
him,	1
“Look	1
here,	1
Sancho,	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
seriously	1
thinking	1
over	1
this	1
ape’s	1
extraordinary	1
gift,	1
and	1
have	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
conclusion	1
that	1
beyond	1
doubt	1
this	1
Master	1
Pedro,	1
his	1
master,	1
has	1
a	1
pact,	1
tacit	1
or	1
express,	1
with	1
the	1
devil.”	1
“If	1
the	1
packet	1
is	1
express	1
from	1
the	1
devil,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“it	1
must	1
be	1
a	1
very	1
dirty	1
packet	1
no	1
doubt;	1
but	1
what	1
good	1
can	1
it	1
do	1
Master	1
Pedro	1
to	1
have	1
such	1
packets?”	1
“Thou	1
dost	1
not	1
understand	1
me,	1
Sancho,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
“I	1
only	1
mean	1
he	1
must	1
have	1
made	1
some	1
compact	1
with	1
the	1
devil	1
to	1
infuse	1
this	1
power	1
into	1
the	1
ape,	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
get	1
his	1
living,	1
and	1
after	1
he	1
has	1
grown	1
rich	1
he	1
will	1
give	1
him	1
his	1
soul,	1
which	1
is	1
what	1
the	1
enemy	1
of	1
mankind	1
wants;	1
this	1
I	1
am	1
led	1
to	1
believe	1
by	1
observing	1
that	1
the	1
ape	1
only	1
answers	1
about	1
things	1
past	1
or	1
present,	1
and	1
the	1
devil’s	1
knowledge	1
extends	1
no	1
further;	1
for	1
the	1
future	1
he	1
knows	1
only	1
by	1
guesswork,	1
and	1
that	1
not	1
always;	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
reserved	1
for	1
God	1
alone	1
to	1
know	1
the	1
times	1
and	1
the	1
seasons,	1
and	1
for	1
him	1
there	1
is	1
neither	1
past	1
nor	1
future;	1
all	1
is	1
present.	1
This	1
being	1
as	1
it	1
is,	1
it	1
is	1
clear	1
that	1
this	1
ape	1
speaks	1
by	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
the	1
devil;	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
astonished	1
they	1
have	1
not	1
denounced	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
Holy	1
Office,	1
and	1
put	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
question,	1
and	1
forced	1
it	1
out	1
of	1
him	1
by	1
whose	1
virtue	1
it	1
is	1
that	1
he	1
divines;	1
because	1
it	1
is	1
certain	1
this	1
ape	1
is	1
not	1
an	1
astrologer;	1
neither	1
his	1
master	1
nor	1
he	1
sets	1
up,	1
or	1
knows	1
how	1
to	1
set	1
up,	1
those	1
figures	1
they	1
call	1
judiciary,	1
which	1
are	1
now	1
so	1
common	1
in	1
Spain	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
jade,	1
or	1
page,	1
or	1
old	1
cobbler,	1
that	1
will	1
not	1
undertake	1
to	1
set	1
up	1
a	1
figure	1
as	1
readily	1
as	1
pick	1
up	1
a	1
knave	1
of	1
cards	1
from	1
the	1
ground,	1
bringing	1
to	1
nought	1
the	1
marvellous	1
truth	1
of	1
the	1
science	1
by	1
their	1
lies	1
and	1
ignorance.	1
I	1
know	1
of	1
a	1
lady	1
who	1
asked	1
one	1
of	1
these	1
figure	1
schemers	1
whether	1
her	1
little	1
lap-dog	1
would	1
be	1
in	1
pup	1
and	1
would	1
breed,	1
and	1
how	1
many	1
and	1
of	1
what	1
colour	1
the	1
little	1
pups	1
would	1
be.	1
To	1
which	1
señor	1
astrologer,	1
after	1
having	1
set	1
up	1
his	1
figure,	1
made	1
answer	1
that	1
the	1
bitch	1
would	1
be	1
in	1
pup,	1
and	1
would	1
drop	1
three	1
pups,	1
one	1
green,	1
another	1
bright	1
red,	1
and	1
the	1
third	1
parti-coloured,	1
provided	1
she	1
conceived	1
between	1
eleven	1
and	1
twelve	1
either	1
of	1
the	1
day	1
or	1
night,	1
and	1
on	1
a	1
Monday	1
or	1
Saturday;	1
but	1
as	1
things	1
turned	1
out,	1
two	1
days	1
after	1
this	1
the	1
bitch	1
died	1
of	1
a	1
surfeit,	1
and	1
señor	1
planet-ruler	1
had	1
the	1
credit	1
all	1
over	1
the	1
place	1
of	1
being	1
a	1
most	1
profound	1
astrologer,	1
as	1
most	1
of	1
these	1
planet-rulers	1
have.”	1
“Still,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“I	1
would	1
be	1
glad	1
if	1
your	1
worship	1
would	1
make	1
Master	1
Pedro	1
ask	1
his	1
ape	1
whether	1
what	1
happened	1
your	1
worship	1
in	1
the	1
cave	1
of	1
Montesinos	1
is	1
true;	1
for,	1
begging	1
your	1
worship’s	1
pardon,	1
I,	1
for	1
my	1
part,	1
take	1
it	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
all	1
flam	1
and	1
lies,	1
or	1
at	1
any	1
rate	1
something	1
you	1
dreamt.”	1
“That	1
may	1
be,”	1
replied	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
“however,	1
I	1
will	1
do	1
what	1
you	1
suggest;	1
though	1
I	1
have	1
my	1
own	1
scruples	1
about	1
it.”	1
At	1
this	1
point	1
Master	1
Pedro	1
came	1
up	1
in	1
quest	1
of	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
to	1
tell	1
him	1
the	1
show	1
was	1
now	1
ready	1
and	1
to	1
come	1
and	1
see	1
it,	1
for	1
it	1
was	1
worth	1
seeing.	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
explained	1
his	1
wish,	1
and	1
begged	1
him	1
to	1
ask	1
his	1
ape	1
at	1
once	1
to	1
tell	1
him	1
whether	1
certain	1
things	1
which	1
had	1
happened	1
to	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
cave	1
of	1
Montesinos	1
were	1
dreams	1
or	1
realities,	1
for	1
to	1
him	1
they	1
appeared	1
to	1
partake	1
of	1
both.	1
Upon	1
this	1
Master	1
Pedro,	1
without	1
answering,	1
went	1
back	1
to	1
fetch	1
the	1
ape,	1
and,	1
having	1
placed	1
it	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
and	1
Sancho,	1
said:	1
“See	1
here,	1
señor	1
ape,	1
this	1
gentleman	1
wishes	1
to	1
know	1
whether	1
certain	1
things	1
which	1
happened	1
to	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
cave	1
called	1
the	1
cave	1
of	1
Montesinos	1
were	1
false	1
or	1
true.”	1
On	1
his	1
making	1
the	1
usual	1
sign	1
the	1
ape	1
mounted	1
on	1
his	1
left	1
shoulder	1
and	1
seemed	1
to	1
whisper	1
in	1
his	1
ear,	1
and	1
Master	1
Pedro	1
said	1
at	1
once,	1
“The	1
ape	1
says	1
that	1
the	1
things	1
you	1
saw	1
or	1
that	1
happened	1
to	1
you	1
in	1
that	1
cave	1
are,	1
part	1
of	1
them	1
false,	1
part	1
true;	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
only	1
knows	1
this	1
and	1
no	1
more	1
as	1
regards	1
this	1
question;	1
but	1
if	1
your	1
worship	1
wishes	1
to	1
know	1
more,	1
on	1
Friday	1
next	1
he	1
will	1
answer	1
all	1
that	1
may	1
be	1
asked	1
him,	1
for	1
his	1
virtue	1
is	1
at	1
present	1
exhausted,	1
and	1
will	1
not	1
return	1
to	1
him	1
till	1
Friday,	1
as	1
he	1
has	1
said.”	1
“Did	1
I	1
not	1
say,	1
señor,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“that	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
bring	1
myself	1
to	1
believe	1
that	1
all	1
your	1
worship	1
said	1
about	1
the	1
adventures	1
in	1
the	1
cave	1
was	1
true,	1
or	1
even	1
the	1
half	1
of	1
it?”	1
“The	1
course	1
of	1
events	1
will	1
tell,	1
Sancho,”	1
replied	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
“time,	1
that	1
discloses	1
all	1
things,	1
leaves	1
nothing	1
that	1
it	1
does	1
not	1
drag	1
into	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
day,	1
though	1
it	1
be	1
buried	1
in	1
the	1
bosom	1
of	1
the	1
earth.	1
But	1
enough	1
of	1
that	1
for	1
the	1
present;	1
let	1
us	1
go	1
and	1
see	1
Master	1
Pedro’s	1
show,	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
there	1
must	1
be	1
something	1
novel	1
in	1
it.”	1
“Something!”	1
said	1
Master	1
Pedro;	1
“this	1
show	1
of	1
mine	1
has	1
sixty	1
thousand	1
novel	1
things	1
in	1
it;	1
let	1
me	1
tell	1
you,	1
Señor	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
it	1
is	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
best-worth-seeing	1
things	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
this	1
day;	1
but	1
_operibus	1
credite	1
et	1
non	1
verbis_,	1
and	1
now	1
let’s	1
get	1
to	1
work,	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
growing	1
late,	1
and	1
we	1
have	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
to	1
do	1
and	1
to	1
say	1
and	1
show.”	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
and	1
Sancho	1
obeyed	1
him	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
where	1
the	1
show	1
was	1
already	1
put	1
up	1
and	1
uncovered,	1
set	1
all	1
around	1
with	1
lighted	1
wax	1
tapers	1
which	1
made	1
it	1
look	1
splendid	1
and	1
bright.	1
When	1
they	1
came	1
to	1
it	1
Master	1
Pedro	1
ensconced	1
himself	1
inside	1
it,	1
for	1
it	1
was	1
he	1
who	1
had	1
to	1
work	1
the	1
puppets,	1
and	1
a	1
boy,	1
a	1
servant	1
of	1
his,	1
posted	1
himself	1
outside	1
to	1
act	1
as	1
showman	1
and	1
explain	1
the	1
mysteries	1
of	1
the	1
exhibition,	1
having	1
a	1
wand	1
in	1
his	1
hand	1
to	1
point	1
to	1
the	1
figures	1
as	1
they	1
came	1
out.	1
And	1
so,	1
all	1
who	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
inn	1
being	1
arranged	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
the	1
show,	1
some	1
of	1
them	1
standing,	1
and	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
Sancho,	1
the	1
page,	1
and	1
cousin,	1
accommodated	1
with	1
the	1
best	1
places,	1
the	1
interpreter	1
began	1
to	1
say	1
what	1
he	1
will	1
hear	1
or	1
see	1
who	1
reads	1
or	1

All	1
were	1
silent,	1
Tyrians	1
and	1
Trojans;	1
I	1
mean	1
all	1
who	1
were	1
watching	1
the	1
show	1
were	1
hanging	1
on	1
the	1
lips	1
of	1
the	1
interpreter	1
of	1
its	1
wonders,	1
when	1
drums	1
and	1
trumpets	1
were	1
heard	1
to	1
sound	1
inside	1
it	1
and	1
cannon	1
to	1
go	1
off.	1
The	1
noise	1
was	1
soon	1
over,	1
and	1
then	1
the	1
boy	1
lifted	1
up	1
his	1
voice	1
and	1
said,	1
“This	1
true	1
story	1
which	1
is	1
here	1
represented	1
to	1
your	1
worships	1
is	1
taken	1
word	1
for	1
word	1
from	1
the	1
French	1
chronicles	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
Spanish	1
ballads	1
that	1
are	1
in	1
everybody’s	1
mouth,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
the	1
boys	1
about	1
the	1
streets.	1
Its	1
subject	1
is	1
the	1
release	1
by	1
Señor	1
Don	1
Gaiferos	1
of	1
his	1
wife	1
Melisendra,	1
when	1
a	1
captive	1
in	1
Spain	1
at	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
the	1
Moors	1
in	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
Sansueña,	1
for	1
so	1
they	1
called	1
then	1
what	1
is	1
now	1
called	1
Saragossa;	1
and	1
there	1
you	1
may	1
see	1
how	1
Don	1
Gaiferos	1
is	1
playing	1
at	1
the	1
tables,	1
just	1
as	1
they	1
sing	1
it-	1
At	1
tables	1
playing	1
Don	1
Gaiferos	1
sits,	1
For	1
Melisendra	1
is	1
forgotten	1
now.	1
And	1
that	1
personage	1
who	1
appears	1
there	1
with	1
a	1
crown	1
on	1
his	1
head	1
and	1
a	1
sceptre	1
in	1
his	1
hand	1
is	1
the	1
Emperor	1
Charlemagne,	1
the	1
supposed	1
father	1
of	1
Melisendra,	1
who,	1
angered	1
to	1
see	1
his	1
son-in-law’s	1
inaction	1
and	1
unconcern,	1
comes	1
in	1
to	1
chide	1
him;	1
and	1
observe	1
with	1
what	1
vehemence	1
and	1
energy	1
he	1
chides	1
him,	1
so	1
that	1
you	1
would	1
fancy	1
he	1
was	1
going	1
to	1
give	1
him	1
half	1
a	1
dozen	1
raps	1
with	1
his	1
sceptre;	1
and	1
indeed	1
there	1
are	1
authors	1
who	1
say	1
he	1
did	1
give	1
them,	1
and	1
sound	1
ones	1
too;	1
and	1
after	1
having	1
said	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
to	1
him	1
about	1
imperilling	1
his	1
honour	1
by	1
not	1
effecting	1
the	1
release	1
of	1
his	1
wife,	1
he	1
said,	1
so	1
the	1
tale	1
runs,	1
Enough	1
I’ve	1
said,	1
see	1
to	1
it	1
now.	1
Observe,	1
too,	1
how	1
the	1
emperor	1
turns	1
away,	1
and	1
leaves	1
Don	1
Gaiferos	1
fuming;	1
and	1
you	1
see	1
now	1
how	1
in	1
a	1
burst	1
of	1
anger,	1
he	1
flings	1
the	1
table	1
and	1
the	1
board	1
far	1
from	1
him	1
and	1
calls	1
in	1
haste	1
for	1
his	1
armour,	1
and	1
asks	1
his	1
cousin	1
Don	1
Roland	1
for	1
the	1
loan	1
of	1
his	1
sword,	1
Durindana,	1
and	1
how	1
Don	1
Roland	1
refuses	1
to	1
lend	1
it,	1
offering	1
him	1
his	1
company	1
in	1
the	1
difficult	1
enterprise	1
he	1
is	1
undertaking;	1
but	1
he,	1
in	1
his	1
valour	1
and	1
anger,	1
will	1
not	1
accept	1
it,	1
and	1
says	1
that	1
he	1
alone	1
will	1
suffice	1
to	1
rescue	1
his	1
wife,	1
even	1
though	1
she	1
were	1
imprisoned	1
deep	1
in	1
the	1
centre	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
with	1
this	1
he	1
retires	1
to	1
arm	1
himself	1
and	1
set	1
out	1
on	1
his	1
journey	1
at	1
once.	1
Now	1
let	1
your	1
worships	1
turn	1
your	1
eyes	1
to	1
that	1
tower	1
that	1
appears	1
there,	1
which	1
is	1
supposed	1
to	1
be	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
towers	1
of	1
the	1
alcazar	1
of	1
Saragossa,	1
now	1
called	1
the	1
Aljaferia;	1
that	1
lady	1
who	1
appears	1
on	1
that	1
balcony	1
dressed	1
in	1
Moorish	1
fashion	1
is	1
the	1
peerless	1
Melisendra,	1
for	1
many	1
a	1
time	1
she	1
used	1
to	1
gaze	1
from	1
thence	1
upon	1
the	1
road	1
to	1
France,	1
and	1
seek	1
consolation	1
in	1
her	1
captivity	1
by	1
thinking	1
of	1
Paris	1
and	1
her	1
husband.	1
Observe,	1
too,	1
a	1
new	1
incident	1
which	1
now	1
occurs,	1
such	1
as,	1
perhaps,	1
never	1
was	1
seen.	1
Do	1
you	1
not	1
see	1
that	1
Moor,	1
who	1
silently	1
and	1
stealthily,	1
with	1
his	1
finger	1
on	1
his	1
lip,	1
approaches	1
Melisendra	1
from	1
behind?	1
Observe	1
now	1
how	1
he	1
prints	1
a	1
kiss	1
upon	1
her	1
lips,	1
and	1
what	1
a	1
hurry	1
she	1
is	1
in	1
to	1
spit,	1
and	1
wipe	1
them	1
with	1
the	1
white	1
sleeve	1
of	1
her	1
smock,	1
and	1
how	1
she	1
bewails	1
herself,	1
and	1
tears	1
her	1
fair	1
hair	1
as	1
though	1
it	1
were	1
to	1
blame	1
for	1
the	1
wrong.	1
Observe,	1
too,	1
that	1
the	1
stately	1
Moor	1
who	1
is	1
in	1
that	1
corridor	1
is	1
King	1
Marsilio	1
of	1
Sansueña,	1
who,	1
having	1
seen	1
the	1
Moor’s	1
insolence,	1
at	1
once	1
orders	1
him	1
(though	1
his	1
kinsman	1
and	1
a	1
great	1
favourite	1
of	1
his)	1
to	1
be	1
seized	1
and	1
given	1
two	1
hundred	1
lashes,	1
while	1
carried	1
through	1
the	1
streets	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
according	1
to	1
custom,	1
with	1
criers	1
going	1
before	1
him	1
and	1
officers	1
of	1
justice	1
behind;	1
and	1
here	1
you	1
see	1
them	1
come	1
out	1
to	1
execute	1
the	1
sentence,	1
although	1
the	1
offence	1
has	1
been	1
scarcely	1
committed;	1
for	1
among	1
the	1
Moors	1
there	1
are	1
no	1
indictments	1
nor	1
remands	1
as	1
with	1
us.”	1
Here	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
called	1
out,	1
“Child,	1
child,	1
go	1
straight	1
on	1
with	1
your	1
story,	1
and	1
don’t	1
run	1
into	1
curves	1
and	1
slants,	1
for	1
to	1
establish	1
a	1
fact	1
clearly	1
there	1
is	1
need	1
of	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
of	1
proof	1
and	1
confirmation;”	1
and	1
said	1
Master	1
Pedro	1
from	1
within,	1
“Boy,	1
stick	1
to	1
your	1
text	1
and	1
do	1
as	1
the	1
gentleman	1
bids	1
you;	1
it’s	1
the	1
best	1
plan;	1
keep	1
to	1
your	1
plain	1
song,	1
and	1
don’t	1
attempt	1
harmonies,	1
for	1
they	1
are	1
apt	1
to	1
break	1
down	1
from	1
being	1
over	1
fine.”	1
“I	1
will,”	1
said	1
the	1
boy,	1
and	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
to	1
say,	1
“This	1
figure	1
that	1
you	1
see	1
here	1
on	1
horseback,	1
covered	1
with	1
a	1
Gascon	1
cloak,	1
is	1
Don	1
Gaiferos	1
himself,	1
whom	1
his	1
wife,	1
now	1
avenged	1
of	1
the	1
insult	1
of	1
the	1
amorous	1
Moor,	1
and	1
taking	1
her	1
stand	1
on	1
the	1
balcony	1
of	1
the	1
tower	1
with	1
a	1
calmer	1
and	1
more	1
tranquil	1
countenance,	1
has	1
perceived	1
without	1
recognising	1
him;	1
and	1
she	1
addresses	1
her	1
husband,	1
supposing	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
some	1
traveller,	1
and	1
holds	1
with	1
him	1
all	1
that	1
conversation	1
and	1
colloquy	1
in	1
the	1
ballad	1
that	1
runs—	1
If	1
you,	1
sir	1
knight,	1
to	1
France	1
are	1
bound,	1
Oh!	1
for	1
Gaiferos	1
ask—	1
which	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
repeat	1
here	1
because	1
prolixity	1
begets	1
disgust;	1
suffice	1
it	1
to	1
observe	1
how	1
Don	1
Gaiferos	1
discovers	1
himself,	1
and	1
that	1
by	1
her	1
joyful	1
gestures	1
Melisendra	1
shows	1
us	1
she	1
has	1
recognised	1
him;	1
and	1
what	1
is	1
more,	1
we	1
now	1
see	1
she	1
lowers	1
herself	1
from	1
the	1
balcony	1
to	1
place	1
herself	1
on	1
the	1
haunches	1
of	1
her	1
good	1
husband’s	1
horse.	1
But	1
ah!	1
unhappy	1
lady,	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
her	1
petticoat	1
has	1
caught	1
on	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
bars	1
of	1
the	1
balcony	1
and	1
she	1
is	1
left	1
hanging	1
in	1
the	1
air,	1
unable	1
to	1
reach	1
the	1
ground.	1
But	1
you	1
see	1
how	1
compassionate	1
heaven	1
sends	1
aid	1
in	1
our	1
sorest	1
need;	1
Don	1
Gaiferos	1
advances,	1
and	1
without	1
minding	1
whether	1
the	1
rich	1
petticoat	1
is	1
torn	1
or	1
not,	1
he	1
seizes	1
her	1
and	1
by	1
force	1
brings	1
her	1
to	1
the	1
ground,	1
and	1
then	1
with	1
one	1
jerk	1
places	1
her	1
on	1
the	1
haunches	1
of	1
his	1
horse,	1
astraddle	1
like	1
a	1
man,	1
and	1
bids	1
her	1
hold	1
on	1
tight	1
and	1
clasp	1
her	1
arms	1
round	1
his	1
neck,	1
crossing	1
them	1
on	1
his	1
breast	1
so	1
as	1
not	1
to	1
fall,	1
for	1
the	1
lady	1
Melisendra	1
was	1
not	1
used	1
to	1
that	1
style	1
of	1
riding.	1
You	1
see,	1
too,	1
how	1
the	1
neighing	1
of	1
the	1
horse	1
shows	1
his	1
satisfaction	1
with	1
the	1
gallant	1
and	1
beautiful	1
burden	1
he	1
bears	1
in	1
his	1
lord	1
and	1
lady.	1
You	1
see	1
how	1
they	1
wheel	1
round	1
and	1
quit	1
the	1
city,	1
and	1
in	1
joy	1
and	1
gladness	1
take	1
the	1
road	1
to	1
Paris.	1
Go	1
in	1
peace,	1
O	1
peerless	1
pair	1
of	1
true	1
lovers!	1
May	1
you	1
reach	1
your	1
longed-for	1
fatherland	1
in	1
safety,	1
and	1
may	1
fortune	1
interpose	1
no	1
impediment	1
to	1
your	1
prosperous	1
journey;	1
may	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
your	1
friends	1
and	1
kinsmen	1
behold	1
you	1
enjoying	1
in	1
peace	1
and	1
tranquillity	1
the	1
remaining	1
days	1
of	1
your	1
life—and	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
be	1
as	1
many	1
as	1
those	1
of	1
Nestor!”	1
Here	1
Master	1
Pedro	1
called	1
out	1
again	1
and	1
said,	1
“Simplicity,	1
boy!	1
None	1
of	1
your	1
high	1
flights;	1
all	1
affectation	1
is	1
bad.”	1
The	1
interpreter	1
made	1
no	1
answer,	1
but	1
went	1
on	1
to	1
say,	1
“There	1
was	1
no	1
want	1
of	1
idle	1
eyes,	1
that	1
see	1
everything,	1
to	1
see	1
Melisendra	1
come	1
down	1
and	1
mount,	1
and	1
word	1
was	1
brought	1
to	1
King	1
Marsilio,	1
who	1
at	1
once	1
gave	1
orders	1
to	1
sound	1
the	1
alarm;	1
and	1
see	1
what	1
a	1
stir	1
there	1
is,	1
and	1
how	1
the	1
city	1
is	1
drowned	1
with	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
the	1
bells	1
pealing	1
in	1
the	1
towers	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
mosques.”	1
“Nay,	1
nay,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
at	1
this;	1
“on	1
that	1
point	1
of	1
the	1
bells	1
Master	1
Pedro	1
is	1
very	1
inaccurate,	1
for	1
bells	1
are	1
not	1
in	1
use	1
among	1
the	1
Moors;	1
only	1
kettledrums,	1
and	1
a	1
kind	1
of	1
small	1
trumpet	1
somewhat	1
like	1
our	1
clarion;	1
to	1
ring	1
bells	1
this	1
way	1
in	1
Sansueña	1
is	1
unquestionably	1
a	1
great	1
absurdity.”	1
On	1
hearing	1
this,	1
Master	1
Pedro	1
stopped	1
ringing,	1
and	1
said,	1
“Don’t	1
look	1
into	1
trifles,	1
Señor	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
or	1
want	1
to	1
have	1
things	1
up	1
to	1
a	1
pitch	1
of	1
perfection	1
that	1
is	1
out	1
of	1
reach.	1
Are	1
there	1
not	1
almost	1
every	1
day	1
a	1
thousand	1
comedies	1
represented	1
all	1
round	1
us	1
full	1
of	1
thousands	1
of	1
inaccuracies	1
and	1
absurdities,	1
and,	1
for	1
all	1
that,	1
they	1
have	1
a	1
successful	1
run,	1
and	1
are	1
listened	1
to	1
not	1
only	1
with	1
applause,	1
but	1
with	1
admiration	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
it?	1
Go	1
on,	1
boy,	1
and	1
don’t	1
mind;	1
for	1
so	1
long	1
as	1
I	1
fill	1
my	1
pouch,	1
no	1
matter	1
if	1
I	1
show	1
as	1
many	1
inaccuracies	1
as	1
there	1
are	1
motes	1
in	1
a	1
sunbeam.”	1
“True	1
enough,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
and	1
the	1
boy	1
went	1
on:	1
“See	1
what	1
a	1
numerous	1
and	1
glittering	1
crowd	1
of	1
horsemen	1
issues	1
from	1
the	1
city	1
in	1
pursuit	1
of	1
the	1
two	1
faithful	1
lovers,	1
what	1
a	1
blowing	1
of	1
trumpets	1
there	1
is,	1
what	1
sounding	1
of	1
horns,	1
what	1
beating	1
of	1
drums	1
and	1
tabors;	1
I	1
fear	1
me	1
they	1
will	1
overtake	1
them	1
and	1
bring	1
them	1
back	1
tied	1
to	1
the	1
tail	1
of	1
their	1
own	1
horse,	1
which	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
dreadful	1
sight.”	1

Don	1
Quixote,	1
however,	1
seeing	1
such	1
a	1
swarm	1
of	1
Moors	1
and	1
hearing	1
such	1
a	1
din,	1
thought	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
right	1
to	1
aid	1
the	1
fugitives,	1
and	1
standing	1
up	1
he	1
exclaimed	1
in	1
a	1
loud	1
voice,	1
“Never,	1
while	1
I	1
live,	1
will	1
I	1
permit	1
foul	1
play	1
to	1
be	1
practised	1
in	1
my	1
presence	1
on	1
such	1
a	1
famous	1
knight	1
and	1
fearless	1
lover	1
as	1
Don	1
Gaiferos.	1
Halt!	1
ill-born	1
rabble,	1
follow	1
him	1
not	1
nor	1
pursue	1
him,	1
or	1
ye	1
will	1
have	1
to	1
reckon	1
with	1
me	1
in	1
battle!”	1
and	1
suiting	1
the	1
action	1
to	1
the	1
word,	1
he	1
drew	1
his	1
sword,	1
and	1
with	1
one	1
bound	1
placed	1
himself	1
close	1
to	1
the	1
show,	1
and	1
with	1
unexampled	1
rapidity	1
and	1
fury	1
began	1
to	1
shower	1
down	1
blows	1
on	1
the	1
puppet	1
troop	1
of	1
Moors,	1
knocking	1
over	1
some,	1
decapitating	1
others,	1
maiming	1
this	1
one	1
and	1
demolishing	1
that;	1
and	1
among	1
many	1
more	1
he	1
delivered	1
one	1
down	1
stroke	1
which,	1
if	1
Master	1
Pedro	1
had	1
not	1
ducked,	1
made	1
himself	1
small,	1
and	1
got	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
way,	1
would	1
have	1
sliced	1
off	1
his	1
head	1
as	1
easily	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
made	1
of	1
almond-paste.	1
Master	1
Pedro	1
kept	1
shouting,	1
“Hold	1
hard!	1
Señor	1
Don	1
Quixote!	1
can’t	1
you	1
see	1
they’re	1
not	1
real	1
Moors	1
you’re	1
knocking	1
down	1
and	1
killing	1
and	1
destroying,	1
but	1
only	1
little	1
pasteboard	1
figures!	1
Look—sinner	1
that	1
I	1
am!—how	1
you’re	1
wrecking	1
and	1
ruining	1
all	1
that	1
I’m	1
worth!”	1
But	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
this,	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
did	1
not	1
leave	1
off	1
discharging	1
a	1
continuous	1
rain	1
of	1
cuts,	1
slashes,	1
downstrokes,	1
and	1
backstrokes,	1
and	1
at	1
length,	1
in	1
less	1
than	1
the	1
space	1
of	1
two	1
credos,	1
he	1
brought	1
the	1
whole	1
show	1
to	1
the	1
ground,	1
with	1
all	1
its	1
fittings	1
and	1
figures	1
shivered	1
and	1
knocked	1
to	1
pieces,	1
King	1
Marsilio	1
badly	1
wounded,	1
and	1
the	1
Emperor	1
Charlemagne	1
with	1
his	1
crown	1
and	1
head	1
split	1
in	1
two.	1
The	1
whole	1
audience	1
was	1
thrown	1
into	1
confusion,	1
the	1
ape	1
fled	1
to	1
the	1
roof	1
of	1
the	1
inn,	1
the	1
cousin	1
was	1
frightened,	1
and	1
even	1
Sancho	1
Panza	1
himself	1
was	1
in	1
mighty	1
fear,	1
for,	1
as	1
he	1
swore	1
after	1
the	1
storm	1
was	1
over,	1
he	1
had	1
never	1
seen	1
his	1
master	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
furious	1
passion.	1
The	1
complete	1
destruction	1
of	1
the	1
show	1
being	1
thus	1
accomplished,	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
became	1
a	1
little	1
calmer,	1
said,	1
“I	1
wish	1
I	1
had	1
here	1
before	1
me	1
now	1
all	1
those	1
who	1
do	1
not	1
or	1
will	1
not	1
believe	1
how	1
useful	1
knights-errant	1
are	1
in	1
the	1
world;	1
just	1
think,	1
if	1
I	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
here	1
present,	1
what	1
would	1
have	1
become	1
of	1
the	1
brave	1
Don	1
Gaiferos	1
and	1
the	1
fair	1
Melisendra!	1
Depend	1
upon	1
it,	1
by	1
this	1
time	1
those	1
dogs	1
would	1
have	1
overtaken	1
them	1
and	1
inflicted	1
some	1
outrage	1
upon	1
them.	1
So,	1
then,	1
long	1
live	1
knight-errantry	1
beyond	1
everything	1
living	1
on	1
earth	1
this	1
day!”	1
“Let	1
it	1
live,	1
and	1
welcome,”	1
said	1
Master	1
Pedro	1
at	1
this	1
in	1
a	1
feeble	1
voice,	1
“and	1
let	1
me	1
die,	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
so	1
unfortunate	1
that	1
I	1
can	1
say	1
with	1
King	1
Don	1
Rodrigo—	1
Yesterday	1
was	1
I	1
lord	1
of	1
Spain	1
To-day	1
I’ve	1
not	1
a	1
turret	1
left	1
That	1
I	1
may	1
call	1
mine	1
own.	1
Not	1
half	1
an	1
hour,	1
nay,	1
barely	1
a	1
minute	1
ago,	1
I	1
saw	1
myself	1
lord	1
of	1
kings	1
and	1
emperors,	1
with	1
my	1
stables	1
filled	1
with	1
countless	1
horses,	1
and	1
my	1
trunks	1
and	1
bags	1
with	1
gay	1
dresses	1
unnumbered;	1
and	1
now	1
I	1
find	1
myself	1
ruined	1
and	1
laid	1
low,	1
destitute	1
and	1
a	1
beggar,	1
and	1
above	1
all	1
without	1
my	1
ape,	1
for,	1
by	1
my	1
faith,	1
my	1
teeth	1
will	1
have	1
to	1
sweat	1
for	1
it	1
before	1
I	1
have	1
him	1
caught;	1
and	1
all	1
through	1
the	1
reckless	1
fury	1
of	1
sir	1
knight	1
here,	1
who,	1
they	1
say,	1
protects	1
the	1
fatherless,	1
and	1
rights	1
wrongs,	1
and	1
does	1
other	1
charitable	1
deeds;	1
but	1
whose	1
generous	1
intentions	1
have	1
been	1
found	1
wanting	1
in	1
my	1
case	1
only,	1
blessed	1
and	1
praised	1
be	1
the	1
highest	1
heavens!	1
Verily,	1
knight	1
of	1
the	1
rueful	1
figure	1
he	1
must	1
be	1
to	1
have	1
disfigured	1
mine.”	1
Sancho	1
Panza	1
was	1
touched	1
by	1
Master	1
Pedro’s	1
words,	1
and	1
said	1
to	1
him,	1
“Don’t	1
weep	1
and	1
lament,	1
Master	1
Pedro;	1
you	1
break	1
my	1
heart;	1
let	1
me	1
tell	1
you	1
my	1
master,	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
is	1
so	1
catholic	1
and	1
scrupulous	1
a	1
Christian	1
that,	1
if	1
he	1
can	1
make	1
out	1
that	1
he	1
has	1
done	1
you	1
any	1
wrong,	1
he	1
will	1
own	1
it,	1
and	1
be	1
willing	1
to	1
pay	1
for	1
it	1
and	1
make	1
it	1
good,	1
and	1
something	1
over	1
and	1
above.”	1
“Only	1
let	1
Señor	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
pay	1
me	1
for	1
some	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
work	1
he	1
has	1
destroyed,”	1
said	1
Master	1
Pedro,	1
“and	1
I	1
would	1
be	1
content,	1
and	1
his	1
worship	1
would	1
ease	1
his	1
conscience,	1
for	1
he	1
cannot	1
be	1
saved	1
who	1
keeps	1
what	1
is	1
another’s	1
against	1
the	1
owner’s	1
will,	1
and	1
makes	1
no	1
restitution.”	1
“That	1
is	1
true,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
“but	1
at	1
present	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
aware	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
got	1
anything	1
of	1
yours,	1
Master	1
Pedro.”	1
“What!”	1
returned	1
Master	1
Pedro;	1
“and	1
these	1
relics	1
lying	1
here	1
on	1
the	1
bare	1
hard	1
ground—what	1
scattered	1
and	1
shattered	1
them	1
but	1
the	1
invincible	1
strength	1
of	1
that	1
mighty	1
arm?	1
And	1
whose	1
were	1
the	1
bodies	1
they	1
belonged	1
to	1
but	1
mine?	1
And	1
what	1
did	1
I	1
get	1
my	1
living	1
by	1
but	1
by	1
them?”	1
“Now	1
am	1
I	1
fully	1
convinced,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“of	1
what	1
I	1
had	1
many	1
a	1
time	1
before	1
believed;	1
that	1
the	1
enchanters	1
who	1
persecute	1
me	1
do	1
nothing	1
more	1
than	1
put	1
figures	1
like	1
these	1
before	1
my	1
eyes,	1
and	1
then	1
change	1
and	1
turn	1
them	1
into	1
what	1
they	1
please.	1
In	1
truth	1
and	1
earnest,	1
I	1
assure	1
you	1
gentlemen	1
who	1
now	1
hear	1
me,	1
that	1
to	1
me	1
everything	1
that	1
has	1
taken	1
place	1
here	1
seemed	1
to	1
take	1
place	1
literally,	1
that	1
Melisendra	1
was	1
Melisendra,	1
Don	1
Gaiferos	1
Don	1
Gaiferos,	1
Marsilio	1
Marsilio,	1
and	1
Charlemagne	1
Charlemagne.	1
That	1
was	1
why	1
my	1
anger	1
was	1
roused;	1
and	1
to	1
be	1
faithful	1
to	1
my	1
calling	1
as	1
a	1
knight-errant	1
I	1
sought	1
to	1
give	1
aid	1
and	1
protection	1
to	1
those	1
who	1
fled,	1
and	1
with	1
this	1
good	1
intention	1
I	1
did	1
what	1
you	1
have	1
seen.	1
If	1
the	1
result	1
has	1
been	1
the	1
opposite	1
of	1
what	1
I	1
intended,	1
it	1
is	1
no	1
fault	1
of	1
mine,	1
but	1
of	1
those	1
wicked	1
beings	1
that	1
persecute	1
me;	1
but,	1
for	1
all	1
that,	1
I	1
am	1
willing	1
to	1
condemn	1
myself	1
in	1
costs	1
for	1
this	1
error	1
of	1
mine,	1
though	1
it	1
did	1
not	1
proceed	1
from	1
malice;	1
let	1
Master	1
Pedro	1
see	1
what	1
he	1
wants	1
for	1
the	1
spoiled	1
figures,	1
for	1
I	1
agree	1
to	1
pay	1
it	1
at	1
once	1
in	1
good	1
and	1
current	1
money	1
of	1
Castile.”	1
Master	1
Pedro	1
made	1
him	1
a	1
bow,	1
saying,	1
“I	1
expected	1
no	1
less	1
of	1
the	1
rare	1
Christianity	1
of	1
the	1
valiant	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
of	1
La	1
Mancha,	1
true	1
helper	1
and	1
protector	1
of	1
all	1
destitute	1
and	1
needy	1
vagabonds;	1
master	1
landlord	1
here	1
and	1
the	1
great	1
Sancho	1
Panza	1
shall	1
be	1
the	1
arbitrators	1
and	1
appraisers	1
between	1
your	1
worship	1
and	1
me	1
of	1
what	1
these	1
dilapidated	1
figures	1
are	1
worth	1
or	1
may	1
be	1
worth.”	1
The	1
landlord	1
and	1
Sancho	1
consented,	1
and	1
then	1
Master	1
Pedro	1
picked	1
up	1
from	1
the	1
ground	1
King	1
Marsilio	1
of	1
Saragossa	1
with	1
his	1
head	1
off,	1
and	1
said,	1
“Here	1
you	1
see	1
how	1
impossible	1
it	1
is	1
to	1
restore	1
this	1
king	1
to	1
his	1
former	1
state,	1
so	1
I	1
think,	1
saving	1
your	1
better	1
judgments,	1
that	1
for	1
his	1
death,	1
decease,	1
and	1
demise,	1
four	1
reals	1
and	1
a	1
half	1
may	1
be	1
given	1
me.”	1
“Proceed,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote.	1
“Well	1
then,	1
for	1
this	1
cleavage	1
from	1
top	1
to	1
bottom,”	1
continued	1
Master	1
Pedro,	1
taking	1
up	1
the	1
split	1
Emperor	1
Charlemagne,	1
“it	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
much	1
if	1
I	1
were	1
to	1
ask	1
five	1
reals	1
and	1
a	1
quarter.”	1
“It’s	1
not	1
little,”	1
said	1
Sancho.	1
“Nor	1
is	1
it	1
much,”	1
said	1
the	1
landlord;	1
“make	1
it	1
even,	1
and	1
say	1
five	1
reals.”	1
“Let	1
him	1
have	1
the	1
whole	1
five	1
and	1
a	1
quarter,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
“for	1
the	1
sum	1
total	1
of	1
this	1
notable	1
disaster	1
does	1
not	1
stand	1
on	1
a	1
quarter	1
more	1
or	1
less;	1
and	1
make	1
an	1
end	1
of	1
it	1
quickly,	1
Master	1
Pedro,	1
for	1
it’s	1
getting	1
on	1
to	1
supper-time,	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
some	1
hints	1
of	1
hunger.”	1
“For	1
this	1
figure,”	1
said	1
Master	1
Pedro,	1
“that	1
is	1
without	1
a	1
nose,	1
and	1
wants	1
an	1
eye,	1
and	1
is	1
the	1
fair	1
Melisendra,	1
I	1
ask,	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
reasonable	1
in	1
my	1
charge,	1
two	1
reals	1
and	1
twelve	1
maravedis.”	1
“The	1
very	1
devil	1
must	1
be	1
in	1
it,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“if	1
Melisendra	1
and	1
her	1
husband	1
are	1
not	1
by	1
this	1
time	1
at	1
least	1
on	1
the	1
French	1
border,	1
for	1
the	1
horse	1
they	1
rode	1
on	1
seemed	1
to	1
me	1
to	1
fly	1
rather	1
than	1
gallop;	1
so	1
you	1
needn’t	1
try	1
to	1
sell	1
me	1
the	1
cat	1
for	1
the	1
hare,	1
showing	1
me	1
here	1
a	1
noseless	1
Melisendra	1
when	1
she	1
is	1
now,	1
may	1
be,	1
enjoying	1
herself	1
at	1
her	1
ease	1
with	1
her	1
husband	1
in	1
France.	1
God	1
help	1
every	1
one	1
to	1
his	1
own,	1
Master	1
Pedro,	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
all	1
proceed	1
fairly	1
and	1
honestly;	1
and	1
now	1
go	1
on.”	1
Master	1
Pedro,	1
perceiving	1
that	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
was	1
beginning	1
to	1
wander,	1
and	1
return	1
to	1
his	1
original	1
fancy,	1
was	1
not	1
disposed	1
to	1
let	1
him	1
escape,	1
so	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
him,	1
“This	1
cannot	1
be	1
Melisendra,	1
but	1
must	1
be	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
damsels	1
that	1
waited	1
on	1
her;	1
so	1
if	1
I’m	1
given	1
sixty	1
maravedis	1
for	1
her,	1
I’ll	1
be	1
content	1
and	1
sufficiently	1
paid.”	1
And	1
so	1
he	1
went	1
on,	1
putting	1
values	1
on	1
ever	1
so	1
many	1
more	1
smashed	1
figures,	1
which,	1
after	1
the	1
two	1
arbitrators	1
had	1
adjusted	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
satisfaction	1
of	1
both	1
parties,	1
came	1
to	1
forty	1
reals	1
and	1
three-quarters;	1
and	1
over	1
and	1
above	1
this	1
sum,	1
which	1
Sancho	1
at	1
once	1
disbursed,	1
Master	1
Pedro	1
asked	1
for	1
two	1
reals	1
for	1
his	1
trouble	1
in	1
catching	1
the	1
ape.	1
“Let	1
him	1
have	1
them,	1
Sancho,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
“not	1
to	1
catch	1
the	1
ape,	1
but	1
to	1
get	1
drunk;	1
and	1
two	1
hundred	1
would	1
I	1
give	1
this	1
minute	1
for	1
the	1
good	1
news,	1
to	1
anyone	1
who	1
could	1
tell	1
me	1
positively,	1
that	1
the	1
lady	1
Doña	1
Melisandra	1
and	1
Señor	1
Don	1
Gaiferos	1
were	1
now	1
in	1
France	1
and	1
with	1
their	1
own	1
people.”	1
“No	1
one	1
could	1
tell	1
us	1
that	1
better	1
than	1
my	1
ape,”	1
said	1
Master	1
Pedro;	1
“but	1
there’s	1
no	1
devil	1
that	1
could	1
catch	1
him	1
now;	1
I	1
suspect,	1
however,	1
that	1
affection	1
and	1
hunger	1
will	1
drive	1
him	1
to	1
come	1
looking	1
for	1
me	1
to-night;	1
but	1
to-morrow	1
will	1
soon	1
be	1
here	1
and	1
we	1
shall	1
see.”	1
In	1
short,	1
the	1
puppet-show	1
storm	1
passed	1
off,	1
and	1
all	1
supped	1
in	1
peace	1
and	1
good	1
fellowship	1
at	1
Don	1
Quixote’s	1
expense,	1
for	1
he	1
was	1
the	1
height	1
of	1
generosity.	1
Before	1
it	1
was	1
daylight	1
the	1
man	1
with	1
the	1
lances	1
and	1
halberds	1
took	1
his	1
departure,	1
and	1
soon	1
after	1
daybreak	1
the	1
cousin	1
and	1
the	1
page	1
came	1
to	1
bid	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
farewell,	1
the	1
former	1
returning	1
home,	1
the	1
latter	1
resuming	1
his	1
journey,	1
towards	1
which,	1
to	1
help	1
him,	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
gave	1
him	1
twelve	1
reals.	1
Master	1
Pedro	1
did	1
not	1
care	1
to	1
engage	1
in	1
any	1
more	1
palaver	1
with	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
whom	1
he	1
knew	1
right	1
well;	1
so	1
he	1
rose	1
before	1
the	1
sun,	1
and	1
having	1
got	1
together	1
the	1
remains	1
of	1
his	1
show	1
and	1
caught	1
his	1
ape,	1
he	1
too	1
went	1
off	1
to	1
seek	1
his	1
adventures.	1
The	1
landlord,	1
who	1
did	1
not	1

Cide	1
Hamete,	1
the	1
chronicler	1
of	1
this	1
great	1
history,	1
begins	1
this	1
chapter	1
with	1
these	1
words,	1
“I	1
swear	1
as	1
a	1
Catholic	1
Christian;”	1
with	1
regard	1
to	1
which	1
his	1
translator	1
says	1
that	1
Cide	1
Hamete’s	1
swearing	1
as	1
a	1
Catholic	1
Christian,	1
he	1
being—as	1
no	1
doubt	1
he	1
was—a	1
Moor,	1
only	1
meant	1
that,	1
just	1
as	1
a	1
Catholic	1
Christian	1
taking	1
an	1
oath	1
swears,	1
or	1
ought	1
to	1
swear,	1
what	1
is	1
true,	1
and	1
tell	1
the	1
truth	1
in	1
what	1
he	1
avers,	1
so	1
he	1
was	1
telling	1
the	1
truth,	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
swore	1
as	1
a	1
Catholic	1
Christian,	1
in	1
all	1
he	1
chose	1
to	1
write	1
about	1
Quixote,	1
especially	1
in	1
declaring	1
who	1
Master	1
Pedro	1
was	1
and	1
what	1
was	1
the	1
divining	1
ape	1
that	1
astonished	1
all	1
the	1
villages	1
with	1
his	1
divinations.	1
He	1
says,	1
then,	1
that	1
he	1
who	1
has	1
read	1
the	1
First	1
Part	1
of	1
this	1
history	1
will	1
remember	1
well	1
enough	1
the	1
Gines	1
de	1
Pasamonte	1
whom,	1
with	1
other	1
galley	1
slaves,	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
set	1
free	1
in	1
the	1
Sierra	1
Morena:	1
a	1
kindness	1
for	1
which	1
he	1
afterwards	1
got	1
poor	1
thanks	1
and	1
worse	1
payment	1
from	1
that	1
evil-minded,	1
ill-conditioned	1
set.	1
This	1
Gines	1
de	1
Pasamonte—Don	1
Ginesillo	1
de	1
Parapilla,	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
called	1
him—it	1
was	1
that	1
stole	1
Dapple	1
from	1
Sancho	1
Panza;	1
which,	1
because	1
by	1
the	1
fault	1
of	1
the	1
printers	1
neither	1
the	1
how	1
nor	1
the	1
when	1
was	1
stated	1
in	1
the	1
First	1
Part,	1
has	1
been	1
a	1
puzzle	1
to	1
a	1
good	1
many	1
people,	1
who	1
attribute	1
to	1
the	1
bad	1
memory	1
of	1
the	1
author	1
what	1
was	1
the	1
error	1
of	1
the	1
press.	1
In	1
fact,	1
however,	1
Gines	1
stole	1
him	1
while	1
Sancho	1
Panza	1
was	1
asleep	1
on	1
his	1
back,	1
adopting	1
the	1
plan	1
and	1
device	1
that	1
Brunello	1
had	1
recourse	1
to	1
when	1
he	1
stole	1
Sacripante’s	1
horse	1
from	1
between	1
his	1
legs	1
at	1
the	1
siege	1
of	1
Albracca;	1
and,	1
as	1
has	1
been	1
told,	1
Sancho	1
afterwards	1
recovered	1
him.	1
This	1
Gines,	1
then,	1
afraid	1
of	1
being	1
caught	1
by	1
the	1
officers	1
of	1
justice,	1
who	1
were	1
looking	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
punish	1
him	1
for	1
his	1
numberless	1
rascalities	1
and	1
offences	1
(which	1
were	1
so	1
many	1
and	1
so	1
great	1
that	1
he	1
himself	1
wrote	1
a	1
big	1
book	1
giving	1
an	1
account	1
of	1
them),	1
resolved	1
to	1
shift	1
his	1
quarters	1
into	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
Aragon,	1
and	1
cover	1
up	1
his	1
left	1
eye,	1
and	1
take	1
up	1
the	1
trade	1
of	1
a	1
puppet-showman;	1
for	1
this,	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
juggling,	1
he	1
knew	1
how	1
to	1
practise	1
to	1
perfection.	1
From	1
some	1
released	1
Christians	1
returning	1
from	1
Barbary,	1
it	1
so	1
happened,	1
he	1
bought	1
the	1
ape,	1
which	1
he	1
taught	1
to	1
mount	1
upon	1
his	1
shoulder	1
on	1
his	1
making	1
a	1
certain	1
sign,	1
and	1
to	1
whisper,	1
or	1
seem	1
to	1
do	1
so,	1
in	1
his	1
ear.	1
Thus	1
prepared,	1
before	1
entering	1
any	1
village	1
whither	1
he	1
was	1
bound	1
with	1
his	1
show	1
and	1
his	1
ape,	1
he	1
used	1
to	1
inform	1
himself	1
at	1
the	1
nearest	1
village,	1
or	1
from	1
the	1
most	1
likely	1
person	1
he	1
could	1
find,	1
as	1
to	1
what	1
particular	1
things	1
had	1
happened	1
there,	1
and	1
to	1
whom;	1
and	1
bearing	1
them	1
well	1
in	1
mind,	1
the	1
first	1
thing	1
he	1
did	1
was	1
to	1
exhibit	1
his	1
show,	1
sometimes	1
one	1
story,	1
sometimes	1
another,	1
but	1
all	1
lively,	1
amusing,	1
and	1
familiar.	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
the	1
exhibition	1
was	1
over	1
he	1
brought	1
forward	1
the	1
accomplishments	1
of	1
his	1
ape,	1
assuring	1
the	1
public	1
that	1
he	1
divined	1
all	1
the	1
past	1
and	1
the	1
present,	1
but	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
future	1
he	1
had	1
no	1
skill.	1
For	1
each	1
question	1
answered	1
he	1
asked	1
two	1
reals,	1
and	1
for	1
some	1
he	1
made	1
a	1
reduction,	1
just	1
as	1
he	1
happened	1
to	1
feel	1
the	1
pulse	1
of	1
the	1
questioners;	1
and	1
when	1
now	1
and	1
then	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
houses	1
where	1
things	1
that	1
he	1
knew	1
of	1
had	1
happened	1
to	1
the	1
people	1
living	1
there,	1
even	1
if	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
ask	1
him	1
a	1
question,	1
not	1
caring	1
to	1
pay	1
for	1
it,	1
he	1
would	1
make	1
the	1
sign	1
to	1
the	1
ape	1
and	1
then	1
declare	1
that	1
it	1
had	1
said	1
so	1
and	1
so,	1
which	1
fitted	1
the	1
case	1
exactly.	1
In	1
this	1
way	1
he	1
acquired	1
a	1
prodigious	1
name	1
and	1
all	1
ran	1
after	1
him;	1
on	1
other	1
occasions,	1
being	1
very	1
crafty,	1
he	1
would	1
answer	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
way	1
that	1
the	1
answers	1
suited	1
the	1
questions;	1
and	1
as	1
no	1
one	1
cross-questioned	1
him	1
or	1
pressed	1
him	1
to	1
tell	1
how	1
his	1
ape	1
divined,	1
he	1
made	1
fools	1
of	1
them	1
all	1
and	1
filled	1
his	1
pouch.	1
The	1
instant	1
he	1
entered	1
the	1
inn	1
he	1
knew	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
and	1
Sancho,	1
and	1
with	1
that	1
knowledge	1
it	1
was	1
easy	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
astonish	1
them	1
and	1
all	1
who	1
were	1
there;	1
but	1
it	1
would	1
have	1
cost	1
him	1
dear	1
had	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
brought	1
down	1
his	1
hand	1
a	1
little	1
lower	1
when	1
he	1
cut	1
off	1
King	1
Marsilio’s	1
head	1
and	1
destroyed	1
all	1
his	1
horsemen,	1
as	1
related	1
in	1
the	1
preceeding	1
chapter.	1
So	1
much	1
for	1
Master	1
Pedro	1
and	1
his	1
ape;	1
and	1
now	1
to	1
return	1
to	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
of	1
La	1
Mancha.	1
After	1
he	1
had	1
left	1
the	1
inn	1
he	1
determined	1
to	1
visit,	1
first	1
of	1
all,	1
the	1
banks	1
of	1
the	1
Ebro	1
and	1
that	1
neighbourhood,	1
before	1
entering	1
the	1
city	1
of	1
Saragossa,	1
for	1
the	1
ample	1
time	1
there	1
was	1
still	1
to	1
spare	1
before	1
the	1
jousts	1
left	1
him	1
enough	1
for	1
all.	1
With	1
this	1
object	1
in	1
view	1
he	1
followed	1
the	1
road	1
and	1
travelled	1
along	1
it	1
for	1
two	1
days,	1
without	1
meeting	1
any	1
adventure	1
worth	1
committing	1
to	1
writing	1
until	1
on	1
the	1
third	1
day,	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
ascending	1
a	1
hill,	1
he	1
heard	1
a	1
great	1
noise	1
of	1
drums,	1
trumpets,	1
and	1
musket-shots.	1
At	1
first	1
he	1
imagined	1
some	1
regiment	1
of	1
soldiers	1
was	1
passing	1
that	1
way,	1
and	1
to	1
see	1
them	1
he	1
spurred	1
Rocinante	1
and	1
mounted	1
the	1
hill.	1
On	1
reaching	1
the	1
top	1
he	1
saw	1
at	1
the	1
foot	1
of	1
it	1
over	1
two	1
hundred	1
men,	1
as	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
him,	1
armed	1
with	1
weapons	1
of	1
various	1
sorts,	1
lances,	1
crossbows,	1
partisans,	1
halberds,	1
and	1
pikes,	1
and	1
a	1
few	1
muskets	1
and	1
a	1
great	1
many	1
bucklers.	1
He	1
descended	1
the	1
slope	1
and	1
approached	1
the	1
band	1
near	1
enough	1
to	1
see	1
distinctly	1
the	1
flags,	1
make	1
out	1
the	1
colours	1
and	1
distinguish	1
the	1
devices	1
they	1
bore,	1
especially	1
one	1
on	1
a	1
standard	1
or	1
ensign	1
of	1
white	1
satin,	1
on	1
which	1
there	1
was	1
painted	1
in	1
a	1
very	1
life-like	1
style	1
an	1
ass	1
like	1
a	1
little	1
sard,	1
with	1
its	1
head	1
up,	1
its	1
mouth	1
open	1
and	1
its	1
tongue	1
out,	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
act	1
and	1
attitude	1
of	1
braying;	1
and	1
round	1
it	1
were	1
inscribed	1
in	1
large	1
characters	1
these	1
two	1
lines—	1
They	1
did	1
not	1
bray	1
in	1
vain,	1
Our	1
alcaldes	1
twain.	1
From	1
this	1
device	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
concluded	1
that	1
these	1
people	1
must	1
be	1
from	1
the	1
braying	1
town,	1
and	1
he	1
said	1
so	1
to	1
Sancho,	1
explaining	1
to	1
him	1
what	1
was	1
written	1
on	1
the	1
standard.	1
At	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
be	1
observed	1
that	1
the	1
man	1
who	1
had	1
told	1
them	1
about	1
the	1
matter	1
was	1
wrong	1
in	1
saying	1
that	1
the	1
two	1
who	1
brayed	1
were	1
regidors,	1
for	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
lines	1
of	1
the	1
standard	1
they	1
were	1
alcaldes.	1
To	1
which	1
Sancho	1
replied,	1
“Señor,	1
there’s	1
nothing	1
to	1
stick	1
at	1
in	1
that,	1
for	1
maybe	1
the	1
regidors	1
who	1
brayed	1
then	1
came	1
to	1
be	1
alcaldes	1
of	1
their	1
town	1
afterwards,	1
and	1
so	1
they	1
may	1
go	1
by	1
both	1
titles;	1
moreover,	1
it	1
has	1
nothing	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
the	1
truth	1
of	1
the	1
story	1
whether	1
the	1
brayers	1
were	1
alcaldes	1
or	1
regidors,	1
provided	1
at	1
any	1
rate	1
they	1
did	1
bray;	1
for	1
an	1
alcalde	1
is	1
just	1
as	1
likely	1
to	1
bray	1
as	1
a	1
regidor.”	1
They	1
perceived,	1
in	1
short,	1
clearly	1
that	1
the	1
town	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
twitted	1
had	1
turned	1
out	1
to	1
do	1
battle	1
with	1
some	1
other	1
that	1
had	1
jeered	1
it	1
more	1
than	1
was	1
fair	1
or	1
neighbourly.	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
proceeded	1
to	1
join	1
them,	1
not	1
a	1
little	1
to	1
Sancho’s	1
uneasiness,	1
for	1
he	1
never	1
relished	1
mixing	1
himself	1
up	1
in	1
expeditions	1
of	1
that	1
sort.	1
The	1
members	1
of	1
the	1
troop	1
received	1
him	1
into	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
them,	1
taking	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
someone	1
who	1
was	1
on	1
their	1
side.	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
putting	1
up	1
his	1
visor,	1
advanced	1
with	1
an	1
easy	1
bearing	1
and	1
demeanour	1
to	1
the	1
standard	1
with	1
the	1
ass,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
chief	1
men	1
of	1
the	1
army	1
gathered	1
round	1
him	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
him,	1
staring	1
at	1
him	1
with	1
the	1
usual	1
amazement	1
that	1
everybody	1
felt	1
on	1
seeing	1
him	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time.	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
seeing	1
them	1
examining	1
him	1
so	1
attentively,	1
and	1
that	1
none	1
of	1
them	1
spoke	1
to	1
him	1
or	1
put	1
any	1
question	1
to	1
him,	1
determined	1
to	1
take	1
advantage	1
of	1
their	1
silence;	1
so,	1
breaking	1
his	1
own,	1
he	1
lifted	1
up	1
his	1
voice	1
and	1
said,	1
“Worthy	1
sirs,	1
I	1
entreat	1
you	1
as	1
earnestly	1
as	1
I	1
can	1
not	1
to	1
interrupt	1
an	1
argument	1
I	1
wish	1
to	1
address	1
to	1
you,	1
until	1
you	1
find	1
it	1
displeases	1
or	1
wearies	1
you;	1
and	1
if	1
that	1
come	1
to	1
pass,	1
on	1
the	1
slightest	1
hint	1
you	1
give	1
me	1
I	1
will	1
put	1
a	1
seal	1
upon	1
my	1
lips	1
and	1
a	1
gag	1
upon	1
my	1
tongue.”	1
They	1
all	1
bade	1
him	1
say	1
what	1
he	1
liked,	1
for	1
they	1
would	1
listen	1
to	1
him	1
willingly.	1

With	1
this	1
permission	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
went	1
on	1
to	1
say,	1
“I,	1
sirs,	1
am	1
a	1
knight-errant	1
whose	1
calling	1
is	1
that	1
of	1
arms,	1
and	1
whose	1
profession	1
is	1
to	1
protect	1
those	1
who	1
require	1
protection,	1
and	1
give	1
help	1
to	1
such	1
as	1
stand	1
in	1
need	1
of	1
it.	1
Some	1
days	1
ago	1
I	1
became	1
acquainted	1
with	1
your	1
misfortune	1
and	1
the	1
cause	1
which	1
impels	1
you	1
to	1
take	1
up	1
arms	1
again	1
and	1
again	1
to	1
revenge	1
yourselves	1
upon	1
your	1
enemies;	1
and	1
having	1
many	1
times	1
thought	1
over	1
your	1
business	1
in	1
my	1
mind,	1
I	1
find	1
that,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
laws	1
of	1
combat,	1
you	1
are	1
mistaken	1
in	1
holding	1
yourselves	1
insulted;	1
for	1
a	1
private	1
individual	1
cannot	1
insult	1
an	1
entire	1
community;	1
unless	1
it	1
be	1
by	1
defying	1
it	1
collectively	1
as	1
a	1
traitor,	1
because	1
he	1
cannot	1
tell	1
who	1
in	1
particular	1
is	1
guilty	1
of	1
the	1
treason	1
for	1
which	1
he	1
defies	1
it.	1
Of	1
this	1
we	1
have	1
an	1
example	1
in	1
Don	1
Diego	1
Ordoñez	1
de	1
Lara,	1
who	1
defied	1
the	1
whole	1
town	1
of	1
Zamora,	1
because	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
that	1
Vellido	1
Dolfos	1
alone	1
had	1
committed	1
the	1
treachery	1
of	1
slaying	1
his	1
king;	1
and	1
therefore	1
he	1
defied	1
them	1
all,	1
and	1
the	1
vengeance	1
and	1
the	1
reply	1
concerned	1
all;	1
though,	1
to	1
be	1
sure,	1
Señor	1
Don	1
Diego	1
went	1
rather	1
too	1
far,	1
indeed	1
very	1
much	1
beyond	1
the	1
limits	1
of	1
a	1
defiance;	1
for	1
he	1
had	1
no	1
occasion	1
to	1
defy	1
the	1
dead,	1
or	1
the	1
waters,	1
or	1
the	1
fishes,	1
or	1
those	1
yet	1
unborn,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
it	1
as	1
set	1
forth;	1
but	1
let	1
that	1
pass,	1
for	1
when	1
anger	1
breaks	1
out	1
there’s	1
no	1
father,	1
governor,	1
or	1
bridle	1
to	1
check	1
the	1
tongue.	1
The	1
case	1
being,	1
then,	1
that	1
no	1
one	1
person	1
can	1
insult	1
a	1
kingdom,	1
province,	1
city,	1
state,	1
or	1
entire	1
community,	1
it	1
is	1
clear	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
reason	1
for	1
going	1
out	1
to	1
avenge	1
the	1
defiance	1
of	1
such	1
an	1
insult,	1
inasmuch	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
one.	1
A	1
fine	1
thing	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
if	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
clock	1
town	1
were	1
to	1
be	1
at	1
loggerheads	1
every	1
moment	1
with	1
everyone	1
who	1
called	1
them	1
by	1
that	1
name,—or	1
the	1
Cazoleros,	1
Berengeneros,	1
Ballenatos,	1
Jaboneros,	1
or	1
the	1
bearers	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
other	1
names	1
and	1
titles	1
that	1
are	1
always	1
in	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
the	1
boys	1
and	1
common	1
people!	1
It	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
nice	1
business	1
indeed	1
if	1
all	1
these	1
illustrious	1
cities	1
were	1
to	1
take	1
huff	1
and	1
revenge	1
themselves	1
and	1
go	1
about	1
perpetually	1
making	1
trombones	1
of	1
their	1
swords	1
in	1
every	1
petty	1
quarrel!	1
No,	1
no;	1
God	1
forbid!	1
There	1
are	1
four	1
things	1
for	1
which	1
sensible	1
men	1
and	1
well-ordered	1
States	1
ought	1
to	1
take	1
up	1
arms,	1
draw	1
their	1
swords,	1
and	1
risk	1
their	1
persons,	1
lives,	1
and	1
properties.	1
The	1
first	1
is	1
to	1
defend	1
the	1
Catholic	1
faith;	1
the	1
second,	1
to	1
defend	1
one’s	1
life,	1
which	1
is	1
in	1
accordance	1
with	1
natural	1
and	1
divine	1
law;	1
the	1
third,	1
in	1
defence	1
of	1
one’s	1
honour,	1
family,	1
and	1
property;	1
the	1
fourth,	1
in	1
the	1
service	1
of	1
one’s	1
king	1
in	1
a	1
just	1
war;	1
and	1
if	1
to	1
these	1
we	1
choose	1
to	1
add	1
a	1
fifth	1
(which	1
may	1
be	1
included	1
in	1
the	1
second),	1
in	1
defence	1
of	1
one’s	1
country.	1
To	1
these	1
five,	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
capital	1
causes,	1
there	1
may	1
be	1
added	1
some	1
others	1
that	1
may	1
be	1
just	1
and	1
reasonable,	1
and	1
make	1
it	1
a	1
duty	1
to	1
take	1
up	1
arms;	1
but	1
to	1
take	1
them	1
up	1
for	1
trifles	1
and	1
things	1
to	1
laugh	1
at	1
and	1
be	1
amused	1
by	1
rather	1
than	1
offended,	1
looks	1
as	1
though	1
he	1
who	1
did	1
so	1
was	1
altogether	1
wanting	1
in	1
common	1
sense.	1
Moreover,	1
to	1
take	1
an	1
unjust	1
revenge	1
(and	1
there	1
cannot	1
be	1
any	1
just	1
one)	1
is	1
directly	1
opposed	1
to	1
the	1
sacred	1
law	1
that	1
we	1
acknowledge,	1
wherein	1
we	1
are	1
commanded	1
to	1
do	1
good	1
to	1
our	1
enemies	1
and	1
to	1
love	1
them	1
that	1
hate	1
us;	1
a	1
command	1
which,	1
though	1
it	1
seems	1
somewhat	1
difficult	1
to	1
obey,	1
is	1
only	1
so	1
to	1
those	1
who	1
have	1
in	1
them	1
less	1
of	1
God	1
than	1
of	1
the	1
world,	1
and	1
more	1
of	1
the	1
flesh	1
than	1
of	1
the	1
spirit;	1
for	1
Jesus	1
Christ,	1
God	1
and	1
true	1
man,	1
who	1
never	1
lied,	1
and	1
could	1
not	1
and	1
cannot	1
lie,	1
said,	1
as	1
our	1
law-giver,	1
that	1
his	1
yoke	1
was	1
easy	1
and	1
his	1
burden	1
light;	1
he	1
would	1
not,	1
therefore,	1
have	1
laid	1
any	1
command	1
upon	1
us	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
impossible	1
to	1
obey.	1
Thus,	1
sirs,	1
you	1
are	1
bound	1
to	1
keep	1
quiet	1
by	1
human	1
and	1
divine	1
law.”	1
“The	1
devil	1
take	1
me,”	1
said	1
Sancho	1
to	1
himself	1
at	1
this,	1
“but	1
this	1
master	1
of	1
mine	1
is	1
a	1
theologian;	1
or,	1
if	1
not,	1
faith,	1
he’s	1
as	1
like	1
one	1
as	1
one	1
egg	1
is	1
like	1
another.”	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
stopped	1
to	1
take	1
breath,	1
and,	1
observing	1
that	1
silence	1
was	1
still	1
preserved,	1
had	1
a	1
mind	1
to	1
continue	1
his	1
discourse,	1
and	1
would	1
have	1
done	1
so	1
had	1
not	1
Sancho	1
interposed	1
with	1
his	1
smartness;	1
for	1
he,	1
seeing	1
his	1
master	1
pause,	1
took	1
the	1
lead,	1
saying,	1
“My	1
lord	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
of	1
La	1
Mancha,	1
who	1
once	1
was	1
called	1
the	1
Knight	1
of	1
the	1
Rueful	1
Countenance,	1
but	1
now	1
is	1
called	1
the	1
Knight	1
of	1
the	1
Lions,	1
is	1
a	1
gentleman	1
of	1
great	1
discretion	1
who	1
knows	1
Latin	1
and	1
his	1
mother	1
tongue	1
like	1
a	1
bachelor,	1
and	1
in	1
everything	1
that	1
he	1
deals	1
with	1
or	1
advises	1
proceeds	1
like	1
a	1
good	1
soldier,	1
and	1
has	1
all	1
the	1
laws	1
and	1
ordinances	1
of	1
what	1
they	1
call	1
combat	1
at	1
his	1
fingers’	1
ends;	1
so	1
you	1
have	1
nothing	1
to	1
do	1
but	1
to	1
let	1
yourselves	1
be	1
guided	1
by	1
what	1
he	1
says,	1
and	1
on	1
my	1
head	1
be	1
it	1
if	1
it	1
is	1
wrong.	1
Besides	1
which,	1
you	1
have	1
been	1
told	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
folly	1
to	1
take	1
offence	1
at	1
merely	1
hearing	1
a	1
bray.	1
I	1
remember	1
when	1
I	1
was	1
a	1
boy	1
I	1
brayed	1
as	1
often	1
as	1
I	1
had	1
a	1
fancy,	1
without	1
anyone	1
hindering	1
me,	1
and	1
so	1
elegantly	1
and	1
naturally	1
that	1
when	1
I	1
brayed	1
all	1
the	1
asses	1
in	1
the	1
town	1
would	1
bray;	1
but	1
I	1
was	1
none	1
the	1
less	1
for	1
that	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
my	1
parents	1
who	1
were	1
greatly	1
respected;	1
and	1
though	1
I	1
was	1
envied	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
gift	1
by	1
more	1
than	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
high	1
and	1
mighty	1
ones	1
of	1
the	1
town,	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
care	1
two	1
farthings	1
for	1
it;	1
and	1
that	1
you	1
may	1
see	1
I	1
am	1
telling	1
the	1
truth,	1
wait	1
a	1
bit	1
and	1
listen,	1
for	1
this	1
art,	1
like	1
swimming,	1
once	1
learnt	1
is	1
never	1
forgotten;”	1
and	1
then,	1
taking	1
hold	1
of	1
his	1
nose,	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
bray	1
so	1
vigorously	1
that	1
all	1
the	1
valleys	1
around	1
rang	1
again.	1
One	1
of	1
those,	1
however,	1
that	1
stood	1
near	1
him,	1
fancying	1
he	1
was	1
mocking	1
them,	1
lifted	1
up	1
a	1
long	1
staff	1
he	1
had	1
in	1
his	1
hand	1
and	1
smote	1
him	1
such	1
a	1
blow	1
with	1
it	1
that	1
Sancho	1
dropped	1
helpless	1
to	1
the	1
ground.	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
seeing	1
him	1
so	1
roughly	1
handled,	1
attacked	1
the	1
man	1
who	1
had	1
struck	1
him	1
lance	1
in	1
hand,	1
but	1
so	1
many	1
thrust	1
themselves	1
between	1
them	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
avenge	1
him.	1
Far	1
from	1
it,	1
finding	1
a	1
shower	1
of	1
stones	1
rained	1
upon	1
him,	1
and	1
crossbows	1
and	1
muskets	1
unnumbered	1
levelled	1
at	1
him,	1
he	1
wheeled	1
Rocinante	1
round	1
and,	1
as	1
fast	1
as	1
his	1
best	1
gallop	1
could	1
take	1
him,	1
fled	1
from	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
them,	1
commending	1
himself	1
to	1
God	1
with	1
all	1
his	1
heart	1
to	1
deliver	1
him	1
out	1
of	1
this	1
peril,	1
in	1
dread	1
every	1
step	1
of	1
some	1
ball	1
coming	1
in	1
at	1
his	1
back	1
and	1
coming	1
out	1
at	1
his	1
breast,	1
and	1
every	1
minute	1
drawing	1
his	1
breath	1
to	1
see	1
whether	1
it	1
had	1
gone	1
from	1
him.	1
The	1
members	1
of	1
the	1
band,	1
however,	1
were	1
satisfied	1
with	1
seeing	1
him	1
take	1
to	1
flight,	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
fire	1
on	1
him.	1
They	1
put	1
up	1
Sancho,	1
scarcely	1
restored	1
to	1
his	1
senses,	1
on	1
his	1
ass,	1
and	1
let	1
him	1
go	1
after	1
his	1
master;	1
not	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
sufficiently	1
in	1
his	1
wits	1
to	1
guide	1
the	1
beast,	1
but	1
Dapple	1
followed	1
the	1
footsteps	1
of	1
Rocinante,	1
from	1
whom	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
remain	1
a	1
moment	1
separated.	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
having	1
got	1
some	1
way	1
off	1
looked	1
back,	1
and	1
seeing	1
Sancho	1
coming,	1
waited	1
for	1
him,	1
as	1
he	1
perceived	1
that	1
no	1
one	1
followed	1
him.	1
The	1
men	1
of	1
the	1
troop	1
stood	1
their	1
ground	1
till	1
night,	1
and	1
as	1
the	1
enemy	1
did	1
not	1
come	1
out	1
to	1
battle,	1
they	1
returned	1
to	1
their	1
town	1
exulting;	1
and	1
had	1
they	1
been	1
aware	1
of	1
the	1
ancient	1
custom	1
of	1
the	1
Greeks,	1
they	1
would	1
have	1
erected	1
a	1
trophy	1
on	1
the	1
spot.	1

When	1
the	1
brave	1
man	1
flees,	1
treachery	1
is	1
manifest	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
for	1
wise	1
men	1
to	1
reserve	1
themselves	1
for	1
better	1
occasions.	1
This	1
proved	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
case	1
with	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
who,	1
giving	1
way	1
before	1
the	1
fury	1
of	1
the	1
townsfolk	1
and	1
the	1
hostile	1
intentions	1
of	1
the	1
angry	1
troop,	1
took	1
to	1
flight	1
and,	1
without	1
a	1
thought	1
of	1
Sancho	1
or	1
the	1
danger	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
leaving	1
him,	1
retreated	1
to	1
such	1
a	1
distance	1
as	1
he	1
thought	1
made	1
him	1
safe.	1
Sancho,	1
lying	1
across	1
his	1
ass,	1
followed	1
him,	1
as	1
has	1
been	1
said,	1
and	1
at	1
length	1
came	1
up,	1
having	1
by	1
this	1
time	1
recovered	1
his	1
senses,	1
and	1
on	1
joining	1
him	1
let	1
himself	1
drop	1
off	1
Dapple	1
at	1
Rocinante’s	1
feet,	1
sore,	1
bruised,	1
and	1
belaboured.	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
dismounted	1
to	1
examine	1
his	1
wounds,	1
but	1
finding	1
him	1
whole	1
from	1
head	1
to	1
foot,	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
him,	1
angrily	1
enough,	1
“In	1
an	1
evil	1
hour	1
didst	1
thou	1
take	1
to	1
braying,	1
Sancho!	1
Where	1
hast	1
thou	1
learned	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
well	1
done	1
to	1
mention	1
the	1
rope	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
man	1
that	1
has	1
been	1
hanged?	1
To	1
the	1
music	1
of	1
brays	1
what	1
harmonies	1
couldst	1
thou	1
expect	1
to	1
get	1
but	1
cudgels?	1
Give	1
thanks	1
to	1
God,	1
Sancho,	1
that	1
they	1
signed	1
the	1
cross	1
on	1
thee	1
just	1
now	1
with	1
a	1
stick,	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
mark	1
thee	1
_per	1
signum	1
crucis_	1
with	1
a	1
cutlass.”	1
“I’m	1
not	1
equal	1
to	1
answering,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“for	1
I	1
feel	1
as	1
if	1
I	1
was	1
speaking	1
through	1
my	1
shoulders;	1
let	1
us	1
mount	1
and	1
get	1
away	1
from	1
this;	1
I’ll	1
keep	1
from	1
braying,	1
but	1
not	1
from	1
saying	1
that	1
knights-errant	1
fly	1
and	1
leave	1
their	1
good	1
squires	1
to	1
be	1
pounded	1
like	1
privet,	1
or	1
made	1
meal	1
of	1
at	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
their	1
enemies.”	1
“He	1
does	1
not	1
fly	1
who	1
retires,”	1
returned	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
“for	1
I	1
would	1
have	1
thee	1
know,	1
Sancho,	1
that	1
the	1
valour	1
which	1
is	1
not	1
based	1
upon	1
a	1
foundation	1
of	1
prudence	1
is	1
called	1
rashness,	1
and	1
the	1
exploits	1
of	1
the	1
rash	1
man	1
are	1
to	1
be	1
attributed	1
rather	1
to	1
good	1
fortune	1
than	1
to	1
courage;	1
and	1
so	1
I	1
own	1
that	1
I	1
retired,	1
but	1
not	1
that	1
I	1
fled;	1
and	1
therein	1
I	1
have	1
followed	1
the	1
example	1
of	1
many	1
valiant	1
men	1
who	1
have	1
reserved	1
themselves	1
for	1
better	1
times;	1
the	1
histories	1
are	1
full	1
of	1
instances	1
of	1
this,	1
but	1
as	1
it	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
any	1
good	1
to	1
thee	1
or	1
pleasure	1
to	1
me,	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
recount	1
them	1
to	1
thee	1
now.”	1
Sancho	1
was	1
by	1
this	1
time	1
mounted	1
with	1
the	1
help	1
of	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
who	1
then	1
himself	1
mounted	1
Rocinante,	1
and	1
at	1
a	1
leisurely	1
pace	1
they	1
proceeded	1
to	1
take	1
shelter	1
in	1
a	1
grove	1
which	1
was	1
in	1
sight	1
about	1
a	1
quarter	1
of	1
a	1
league	1
off.	1
Every	1
now	1
and	1
then	1
Sancho	1
gave	1
vent	1
to	1
deep	1
sighs	1
and	1
dismal	1
groans,	1
and	1
on	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
asking	1
him	1
what	1
caused	1
such	1
acute	1
suffering,	1
he	1
replied	1
that,	1
from	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
his	1
back-bone	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
nape	1
of	1
his	1
neck,	1
he	1
was	1
so	1
sore	1
that	1
it	1
nearly	1
drove	1
him	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
senses.	1
“The	1
cause	1
of	1
that	1
soreness,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“will	1
be,	1
no	1
doubt,	1
that	1
the	1
staff	1
wherewith	1
they	1
smote	1
thee	1
being	1
a	1
very	1
long	1
one,	1
it	1
caught	1
thee	1
all	1
down	1
the	1
back,	1
where	1
all	1
the	1
parts	1
that	1
are	1
sore	1
are	1
situated,	1
and	1
had	1
it	1
reached	1
any	1
further	1
thou	1
wouldst	1
be	1
sorer	1
still.”	1
“By	1
God,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“your	1
worship	1
has	1
relieved	1
me	1
of	1
a	1
great	1
doubt,	1
and	1
cleared	1
up	1
the	1
point	1
for	1
me	1
in	1
elegant	1
style!	1
Body	1
o’	1
me!	1
is	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
my	1
soreness	1
such	1
a	1
mystery	1
that	1
there’s	1
any	1
need	1
to	1
tell	1
me	1
I	1
am	1
sore	1
everywhere	1
the	1
staff	1
hit	1
me?	1
If	1
it	1
was	1
my	1
ankles	1
that	1
pained	1
me	1
there	1
might	1
be	1
something	1
in	1
going	1
divining	1
why	1
they	1
did,	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
much	1
to	1
divine	1
that	1
I’m	1
sore	1
where	1
they	1
thrashed	1
me.	1
By	1
my	1
faith,	1
master	1
mine,	1
the	1
ills	1
of	1
others	1
hang	1
by	1
a	1
hair;	1
every	1
day	1
I	1
am	1
discovering	1
more	1
and	1
more	1
how	1
little	1
I	1
have	1
to	1
hope	1
for	1
from	1
keeping	1
company	1
with	1
your	1
worship;	1
for	1
if	1
this	1
time	1
you	1
have	1
allowed	1
me	1
to	1
be	1
drubbed,	1
the	1
next	1
time,	1
or	1
a	1
hundred	1
times	1
more,	1
we’ll	1
have	1
the	1
blanketings	1
of	1
the	1
other	1
day	1
over	1
again,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
other	1
pranks	1
which,	1
if	1
they	1
have	1
fallen	1
on	1
my	1
shoulders	1
now,	1
will	1
be	1
thrown	1
in	1
my	1
teeth	1
by-and-by.	1
I	1
would	1
do	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
better	1
(if	1
I	1
was	1
not	1
an	1
ignorant	1
brute	1
that	1
will	1
never	1
do	1
any	1
good	1
all	1
my	1
life),	1
I	1
would	1
do	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
better,	1
I	1
say,	1
to	1
go	1
home	1
to	1
my	1
wife	1
and	1
children	1
and	1
support	1
them	1
and	1
bring	1
them	1
up	1
on	1
what	1
God	1
may	1
please	1
to	1
give	1
me,	1
instead	1
of	1
following	1
your	1
worship	1
along	1
roads	1
that	1
lead	1
nowhere	1
and	1
paths	1
that	1
are	1
none	1
at	1
all,	1
with	1
little	1
to	1
drink	1
and	1
less	1
to	1
eat.	1
And	1
then	1
when	1
it	1
comes	1
to	1
sleeping!	1
Measure	1
out	1
seven	1
feet	1
on	1
the	1
earth,	1
brother	1
squire,	1
and	1
if	1
that’s	1
not	1
enough	1
for	1
you,	1
take	1
as	1
many	1
more,	1
for	1
you	1
may	1
have	1
it	1
all	1
your	1
own	1
way	1
and	1
stretch	1
yourself	1
to	1
your	1
heart’s	1
content.	1
Oh	1
that	1
I	1
could	1
see	1
burnt	1
and	1
turned	1
to	1
ashes	1
the	1
first	1
man	1
that	1
meddled	1
with	1
knight-errantry	1
or	1
at	1
any	1
rate	1
the	1
first	1
who	1
chose	1
to	1
be	1
squire	1
to	1
such	1
fools	1
as	1
all	1
the	1
knights-errant	1
of	1
past	1
times	1
must	1
have	1
been!	1
Of	1
those	1
of	1
the	1
present	1
day	1
I	1
say	1
nothing,	1
because,	1
as	1
your	1
worship	1
is	1
one	1
of	1
them,	1
I	1
respect	1
them,	1
and	1
because	1
I	1
know	1
your	1
worship	1
knows	1
a	1
point	1
more	1
than	1
the	1
devil	1
in	1
all	1
you	1
say	1
and	1
think.”	1
“I	1
would	1
lay	1
a	1
good	1
wager	1
with	1
you,	1
Sancho,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“that	1
now	1
that	1
you	1
are	1
talking	1
on	1
without	1
anyone	1
to	1
stop	1
you,	1
you	1
don’t	1
feel	1
a	1
pain	1
in	1
your	1
whole	1
body.	1
Talk	1
away,	1
my	1
son,	1
say	1
whatever	1
comes	1
into	1
your	1
head	1
or	1
mouth,	1
for	1
so	1
long	1
as	1
you	1
feel	1
no	1
pain,	1
the	1
irritation	1
your	1
impertinences	1
give	1
me	1
will	1
be	1
a	1
pleasure	1
to	1
me;	1
and	1
if	1
you	1
are	1
so	1
anxious	1
to	1
go	1
home	1
to	1
your	1
wife	1
and	1
children,	1
God	1
forbid	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
prevent	1
you;	1
you	1
have	1
money	1
of	1
mine;	1
see	1
how	1
long	1
it	1
is	1
since	1
we	1
left	1
our	1
village	1
this	1
third	1
time,	1
and	1
how	1
much	1
you	1
can	1
and	1
ought	1
to	1
earn	1
every	1
month,	1
and	1
pay	1
yourself	1
out	1
of	1
your	1
own	1
hand.”	1
“When	1
I	1
worked	1
for	1
Tom	1
Carrasco,	1
the	1
father	1
of	1
the	1
bachelor	1
Samson	1
Carrasco	1
that	1
your	1
worship	1
knows,”	1
replied	1
Sancho,	1
“I	1
used	1
to	1
earn	1
two	1
ducats	1
a	1
month	1
besides	1
my	1
food;	1
I	1
can’t	1
tell	1
what	1
I	1
can	1
earn	1
with	1
your	1
worship,	1
though	1
I	1
know	1
a	1
knight-errant’s	1
squire	1
has	1
harder	1
times	1
of	1
it	1
than	1
he	1
who	1
works	1
for	1
a	1
farmer;	1
for	1
after	1
all,	1
we	1
who	1
work	1
for	1
farmers,	1
however	1
much	1
we	1
toil	1
all	1
day,	1
at	1
the	1
worst,	1
at	1
night,	1
we	1
have	1
our	1
olla	1
supper	1
and	1
sleep	1
in	1
a	1
bed,	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
slept	1
in	1
since	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
in	1
your	1
worship’s	1
service,	1
if	1
it	1
wasn’t	1
the	1
short	1
time	1
we	1
were	1
in	1
Don	1
Diego	1
de	1
Miranda’s	1
house,	1
and	1
the	1
feast	1
I	1
had	1
with	1
the	1
skimmings	1
I	1
took	1
off	1
Camacho’s	1
pots,	1
and	1
what	1
I	1
ate,	1
drank,	1
and	1
slept	1
in	1
Basilio’s	1
house;	1
all	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
time	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
sleeping	1
on	1
the	1
hard	1
ground	1
under	1
the	1
open	1
sky,	1
exposed	1
to	1
what	1
they	1
call	1
the	1
inclemencies	1
of	1
heaven,	1
keeping	1
life	1
in	1
me	1
with	1
scraps	1
of	1
cheese	1
and	1
crusts	1
of	1
bread,	1
and	1
drinking	1
water	1
either	1
from	1
the	1
brooks	1
or	1
from	1
the	1
springs	1
we	1
come	1
to	1
on	1
these	1
by-paths	1
we	1
travel.”	1
“I	1
own,	1
Sancho,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“that	1
all	1
thou	1
sayest	1
is	1
true;	1
how	1
much,	1
thinkest	1
thou,	1
ought	1
I	1
to	1
give	1
thee	1
over	1
and	1
above	1
what	1
Tom	1
Carrasco	1
gave	1
thee?”	1
“I	1
think,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“that	1
if	1
your	1
worship	1
was	1
to	1
add	1
on	1
two	1
reals	1
a	1
month	1
I’d	1
consider	1
myself	1
well	1
paid;	1
that	1
is,	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
the	1
wages	1
of	1
my	1
labour	1
go;	1
but	1
to	1
make	1
up	1
to	1
me	1
for	1
your	1
worship’s	1
pledge	1
and	1
promise	1
to	1
me	1
to	1
give	1
me	1
the	1
government	1
of	1
an	1
island,	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
fair	1
to	1
add	1
six	1
reals	1
more,	1
making	1
thirty	1
in	1
all.”	1
“Very	1
good,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
“it	1
is	1
twenty-five	1
days	1
since	1
we	1
left	1
our	1
village,	1
so	1
reckon	1
up,	1
Sancho,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
wages	1
you	1
have	1
made	1
out	1
for	1
yourself,	1
and	1
see	1
how	1
much	1
I	1
owe	1
you	1
in	1
proportion,	1
and	1
pay	1
yourself,	1
as	1
I	1
said	1
before,	1
out	1
of	1
your	1
own	1
hand.”	1
“O	1
body	1
o’	1
me!”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“but	1
your	1
worship	1
is	1
very	1
much	1
out	1
in	1
that	1
reckoning;	1
for	1
when	1
it	1
comes	1
to	1
the	1
promise	1
of	1
the	1
island	1
we	1
must	1
count	1
from	1
the	1
day	1
your	1
worship	1
promised	1
it	1
to	1
me	1
to	1
this	1
present	1
hour	1
we	1
are	1
at	1
now.”	1
“Well,	1
how	1
long	1
is	1
it,	1
Sancho,	1
since	1
I	1
promised	1
it	1
to	1
you?”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote.	1
“If	1
I	1
remember	1
rightly,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“it	1
must	1
be	1
over	1
twenty	1
years,	1
three	1
days	1
more	1
or	1
less.”	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
gave	1
himself	1
a	1
great	1
slap	1
on	1
the	1
forehead	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
laugh	1
heartily,	1
and	1
said	1
he,	1
“Why,	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
been	1
wandering,	1
either	1
in	1
the	1
Sierra	1
Morena	1
or	1
in	1
the	1
whole	1
course	1
of	1
our	1
sallies,	1
but	1
barely	1
two	1
months,	1
and	1
thou	1
sayest,	1
Sancho,	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
twenty	1
years	1
since	1
I	1
promised	1
thee	1
the	1
island.	1
I	1
believe	1
now	1
thou	1
wouldst	1
have	1
all	1
the	1
money	1
thou	1
hast	1
of	1
mine	1
go	1
in	1
thy	1
wages.	1
If	1
so,	1
and	1
if	1
that	1
be	1
thy	1
pleasure,	1
I	1
give	1
it	1
to	1
thee	1
now,	1
once	1
and	1
for	1
all,	1
and	1
much	1
good	1
may	1
it	1
do	1
thee,	1
for	1
so	1
long	1
as	1
I	1
see	1
myself	1
rid	1
of	1
such	1
a	1
good-for-nothing	1
squire	1
I’ll	1
be	1
glad	1
to	1
be	1
left	1
a	1
pauper	1
without	1
a	1
rap.	1
But	1
tell	1
me,	1
thou	1
perverter	1
of	1
the	1
squirely	1
rules	1
of	1
knight-errantry,	1
where	1
hast	1
thou	1
ever	1
seen	1
or	1
read	1
that	1
any	1
knight-errant’s	1
squire	1
made	1
terms	1
with	1
his	1
lord,	1
‘you	1
must	1
give	1
me	1
so	1
much	1
a	1
month	1
for	1
serving	1
you’?	1
Plunge,	1
scoundrel,	1
rogue,	1
monster—for	1
such	1
I	1
take	1
thee	1
to	1
be—plunge,	1
I	1
say,	1
into	1
the	1
_mare	1
magnum_	1
of	1
their	1
histories;	1
and	1
if	1
thou	1
shalt	1
find	1
that	1
any	1
squire	1
ever	1
said	1
or	1
thought	1
what	1
thou	1
hast	1
said	1
now,	1
I	1
will	1
let	1
thee	1
nail	1
it	1
on	1
my	1
forehead,	1
and	1
give	1
me,	1
over	1
and	1
above,	1
four	1
sound	1
slaps	1
in	1
the	1
face.	1
Turn	1
the	1
rein,	1
or	1
the	1
halter,	1
of	1
thy	1
Dapple,	1
and	1
begone	1
home;	1
for	1
one	1
single	1
step	1
further	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
make	1
in	1
my	1
company.	1
O	1
bread	1
thanklessly	1
received!	1
O	1
promises	1
ill-bestowed!	1
O	1
man	1
more	1
beast	1
than	1
human	1
being!	1
Now,	1
when	1
I	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
raise	1
thee	1
to	1
such	1
a	1
position,	1
that,	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
thy	1
wife,	1
they	1
would	1
call	1
thee	1
‘my	1
lord,’	1
thou	1
art	1
leaving	1
me?	1
Thou	1
art	1
going	1
now	1
when	1
I	1
had	1
a	1
firm	1
and	1
fixed	1
intention	1
of	1
making	1
thee	1
lord	1
of	1
the	1
best	1
island	1
in	1
the	1
world?	1
Well,	1
as	1
thou	1
thyself	1
hast	1
said	1
before	1
now,	1
honey	1
is	1
not	1
for	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
the	1
ass.	1
Ass	1
thou	1
art,	1
ass	1
thou	1
wilt	1
be,	1
and	1
ass	1
thou	1
wilt	1
end	1
when	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
thy	1
life	1
is	1
run;	1
for	1
I	1
know	1
it	1
will	1
come	1
to	1
its	1
close	1
before	1
thou	1
dost	1
perceive	1
or	1
discern	1
that	1
thou	1
art	1
a	1
beast.”	1
Sancho	1
regarded	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
earnestly	1
while	1
he	1
was	1
giving	1
him	1
this	1
rating,	1
and	1
was	1
so	1
touched	1
by	1
remorse	1
that	1
the	1
tears	1
came	1
to	1
his	1
eyes,	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
piteous	1
and	1
broken	1
voice	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
him,	1
“Master	1
mine,	1
I	1
confess	1
that,	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
complete	1
ass,	1
all	1
I	1
want	1
is	1
a	1
tail;	1
if	1
your	1
worship	1
will	1
only	1
fix	1
one	1
on	1
to	1
me,	1
I’ll	1
look	1
on	1
it	1
as	1
rightly	1
placed,	1
and	1
I’ll	1
serve	1
you	1
as	1
an	1
ass	1
all	1
the	1
remaining	1
days	1
of	1
my	1
life.	1
Forgive	1
me	1
and	1
have	1
pity	1
on	1
my	1
folly,	1
and	1
remember	1
I	1
know	1
but	1
little,	1
and,	1
if	1
I	1
talk	1
much,	1
it’s	1
more	1
from	1
infirmity	1
than	1
malice;	1
but	1
he	1
who	1
sins	1
and	1
mends	1
commends	1
himself	1
to	1
God.”	1
“I	1
should	1
have	1
been	1
surprised,	1
Sancho,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“if	1
thou	1
hadst	1
not	1
introduced	1
some	1
bit	1
of	1
a	1
proverb	1
into	1
thy	1
speech.	1
Well,	1
well,	1
I	1
forgive	1
thee,	1
provided	1
thou	1
dost	1
mend	1
and	1
not	1
show	1
thyself	1
in	1
future	1
so	1
fond	1
of	1
thine	1
own	1
interest,	1
but	1
try	1
to	1
be	1
of	1
good	1
cheer	1
and	1
take	1
heart,	1
and	1
encourage	1
thyself	1
to	1
look	1
forward	1
to	1
the	1
fulfillment	1
of	1
my	1
promises,	1
which,	1
by	1
being	1
delayed,	1
does	1
not	1
become	1
impossible.”	1
Sancho	1
said	1
he	1
would	1
do	1
so,	1
and	1
keep	1
up	1
his	1
heart	1
as	1
best	1
he	1
could.	1
They	1
then	1
entered	1
the	1
grove,	1
and	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
settled	1
himself	1
at	1
the	1
foot	1
of	1
an	1
elm,	1
and	1
Sancho	1
at	1
that	1
of	1
a	1
beech,	1
for	1
trees	1
of	1
this	1
kind	1
and	1
others	1
like	1
them	1
always	1
have	1
feet	1
but	1
no	1
hands.	1
Sancho	1
passed	1
the	1
night	1
in	1
pain,	1
for	1
with	1
the	1
evening	1
dews	1
the	1
blow	1
of	1
the	1
staff	1
made	1
itself	1
felt	1
all	1
the	1
more.	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
passed	1
it	1
in	1
his	1
never-failing	1
meditations;	1
but,	1
for	1
all	1
that,	1
they	1
had	1
some	1
winks	1
of	1
sleep,	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
appearance	1
of	1
daylight	1
they	1
pursued	1
their	1
journey	1
in	1
quest	1
of	1
the	1
banks	1
of	1
the	1
famous	1
Ebro,	1
where	1
that	1
befell	1
them	1
which	1
will	1
be	1
told	1
in	1
the	1
following	1
chapter.	1

By	1
stages	1
as	1
already	1
described	1
or	1
left	1
undescribed,	1
two	1
days	1
after	1
quitting	1
the	1
grove	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
and	1
Sancho	1
reached	1
the	1
river	1
Ebro,	1
and	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
great	1
delight	1
to	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
as	1
he	1
contemplated	1
and	1
gazed	1
upon	1
the	1
charms	1
of	1
its	1
banks,	1
the	1
clearness	1
of	1
its	1
stream,	1
the	1
gentleness	1
of	1
its	1
current	1
and	1
the	1
abundance	1
of	1
its	1
crystal	1
waters;	1
and	1
the	1
pleasant	1
view	1
revived	1
a	1
thousand	1
tender	1
thoughts	1
in	1
his	1
mind.	1
Above	1
all,	1
he	1
dwelt	1
upon	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
seen	1
in	1
the	1
cave	1
of	1
Montesinos;	1
for	1
though	1
Master	1
Pedro’s	1
ape	1
had	1
told	1
him	1
that	1
of	1
those	1
things	1
part	1
was	1
true,	1
part	1
false,	1
he	1
clung	1
more	1
to	1
their	1
truth	1
than	1
to	1
their	1
falsehood,	1
the	1
very	1
reverse	1
of	1
Sancho,	1
who	1
held	1
them	1
all	1
to	1
be	1
downright	1
lies.	1
As	1
they	1
were	1
thus	1
proceeding,	1
then,	1
they	1
discovered	1
a	1
small	1
boat,	1
without	1
oars	1
or	1
any	1
other	1
gear,	1
that	1
lay	1
at	1
the	1
water’s	1
edge	1
tied	1
to	1
the	1
stem	1
of	1
a	1
tree	1
growing	1
on	1
the	1
bank.	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
looked	1
all	1
round,	1
and	1
seeing	1
nobody,	1
at	1
once,	1
without	1
more	1
ado,	1
dismounted	1
from	1
Rocinante	1
and	1
bade	1
Sancho	1
get	1
down	1
from	1
Dapple	1
and	1
tie	1
both	1
beasts	1
securely	1
to	1
the	1
trunk	1
of	1
a	1
poplar	1
or	1
willow	1
that	1
stood	1
there.	1
Sancho	1
asked	1
him	1
the	1
reason	1
of	1
this	1
sudden	1
dismounting	1
and	1
tying.	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
made	1
answer,	1
“Thou	1
must	1
know,	1
Sancho,	1
that	1
this	1
bark	1
is	1
plainly,	1
and	1
without	1
the	1
possibility	1
of	1
any	1
alternative,	1
calling	1
and	1
inviting	1
me	1
to	1
enter	1
it,	1
and	1
in	1
it	1
go	1
to	1
give	1
aid	1
to	1
some	1
knight	1
or	1
other	1
person	1
of	1
distinction	1
in	1
need	1
of	1
it,	1
who	1
is	1
no	1
doubt	1
in	1
some	1
sore	1
strait;	1
for	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
the	1
books	1
of	1
chivalry	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
enchanters	1
who	1
figure	1
and	1
speak	1
in	1
them.	1
When	1
a	1
knight	1
is	1
involved	1
in	1
some	1
difficulty	1
from	1
which	1
he	1
cannot	1
be	1
delivered	1
save	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
another	1
knight,	1
though	1
they	1
may	1
be	1
at	1
a	1
distance	1
of	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
thousand	1
leagues	1
or	1
more	1
one	1
from	1
the	1
other,	1
they	1
either	1
take	1
him	1
up	1
on	1
a	1
cloud,	1
or	1
they	1
provide	1
a	1
bark	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
get	1
into,	1
and	1
in	1
less	1
than	1
the	1
twinkling	1
of	1
an	1
eye	1
they	1
carry	1
him	1
where	1
they	1
will	1
and	1
where	1
his	1
help	1
is	1
required;	1
and	1
so,	1
Sancho,	1
this	1
bark	1
is	1
placed	1
here	1
for	1
the	1
same	1
purpose;	1
this	1
is	1
as	1
true	1
as	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
now	1
day,	1
and	1
ere	1
this	1
one	1
passes	1
tie	1
Dapple	1
and	1
Rocinante	1
together,	1
and	1
then	1
in	1
God’s	1
hand	1
be	1
it	1
to	1
guide	1
us;	1
for	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
hold	1
back	1
from	1
embarking,	1
though	1
barefooted	1
friars	1
were	1
to	1
beg	1
me.”	1
“As	1
that’s	1
the	1
case,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“and	1
your	1
worship	1
chooses	1
to	1
give	1
in	1
to	1
these—I	1
don’t	1
know	1
if	1
I	1
may	1
call	1
them	1
absurdities—at	1
every	1
turn,	1
there’s	1
nothing	1
for	1
it	1
but	1
to	1
obey	1
and	1
bow	1
the	1
head,	1
bearing	1
in	1
mind	1
the	1
proverb,	1
‘Do	1
as	1
thy	1
master	1
bids	1
thee,	1
and	1
sit	1
down	1
to	1
table	1
with	1
him;’	1
but	1
for	1
all	1
that,	1
for	1
the	1
sake	1
of	1
easing	1
my	1
conscience,	1
I	1
warn	1
your	1
worship	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
my	1
opinion	1
this	1
bark	1
is	1
no	1
enchanted	1
one,	1
but	1
belongs	1
to	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
fishermen	1
of	1
the	1
river,	1
for	1
they	1
catch	1
the	1
best	1
shad	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
here.”	1
As	1
Sancho	1
said	1
this,	1
he	1
tied	1
the	1
beasts,	1
leaving	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
care	1
and	1
protection	1
of	1
the	1
enchanters	1
with	1
sorrow	1
enough	1
in	1
his	1
heart.	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
bade	1
him	1
not	1
be	1
uneasy	1
about	1
deserting	1
the	1
animals,	1
“for	1
he	1
who	1
would	1
carry	1
themselves	1
over	1
such	1
longinquous	1
roads	1
and	1
regions	1
would	1
take	1
care	1
to	1
feed	1
them.”	1
“I	1
don’t	1
understand	1
that	1
logiquous,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“nor	1
have	1
I	1
ever	1
heard	1
the	1
word	1
all	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
my	1
life.”	1
“Longinquous,”	1
replied	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“means	1
far	1
off;	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
no	1
wonder	1
thou	1
dost	1
not	1
understand	1
it,	1
for	1
thou	1
art	1
not	1
bound	1
to	1
know	1
Latin,	1
like	1
some	1
who	1
pretend	1
to	1
know	1
it	1
and	1
don’t.”	1
“Now	1
they	1
are	1
tied,”	1
said	1
Sancho;	1
“what	1
are	1
we	1
to	1
do	1
next?”	1
“What?”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“cross	1
ourselves	1
and	1
weigh	1
anchor;	1
I	1
mean,	1
embark	1
and	1
cut	1
the	1
moorings	1
by	1
which	1
the	1
bark	1
is	1
held;”	1
and	1
the	1
bark	1
began	1
to	1
drift	1
away	1
slowly	1
from	1
the	1
bank.	1
But	1
when	1
Sancho	1
saw	1
himself	1
somewhere	1
about	1
two	1
yards	1
out	1
in	1
the	1
river,	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
tremble	1
and	1
give	1
himself	1
up	1
for	1
lost;	1
but	1
nothing	1
distressed	1
him	1
more	1
than	1
hearing	1
Dapple	1
bray	1
and	1
seeing	1
Rocinante	1
struggling	1
to	1
get	1
loose,	1
and	1
said	1
he	1
to	1
his	1
master,	1
“Dapple	1
is	1
braying	1
in	1
grief	1
at	1
our	1
leaving	1
him,	1
and	1
Rocinante	1
is	1
trying	1
to	1
escape	1
and	1
plunge	1
in	1
after	1
us.	1
O	1
dear	1
friends,	1
peace	1
be	1
with	1
you,	1
and	1
may	1
this	1
madness	1
that	1
is	1
taking	1
us	1
away	1
from	1
you,	1
turned	1
into	1
sober	1
sense,	1
bring	1
us	1
back	1
to	1
you.”	1
And	1
with	1
this	1
he	1
fell	1
weeping	1
so	1
bitterly,	1
that	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
said	1
to	1
him,	1
sharply	1
and	1
angrily,	1
“What	1
art	1
thou	1
afraid	1
of,	1
cowardly	1
creature?	1
What	1
art	1
thou	1
weeping	1
at,	1
heart	1
of	1
butter-paste?	1
Who	1
pursues	1
or	1
molests	1
thee,	1
thou	1
soul	1
of	1
a	1
tame	1
mouse?	1
What	1
dost	1
thou	1
want,	1
unsatisfied	1
in	1
the	1
very	1
heart	1
of	1
abundance?	1
Art	1
thou,	1
perchance,	1
tramping	1
barefoot	1
over	1
the	1
Riphaean	1
mountains,	1
instead	1
of	1
being	1
seated	1
on	1
a	1
bench	1
like	1
an	1
archduke	1
on	1
the	1
tranquil	1
stream	1
of	1
this	1
pleasant	1
river,	1
from	1
which	1
in	1
a	1
short	1
space	1
we	1
shall	1
come	1
out	1
upon	1
the	1
broad	1
sea?	1
But	1
we	1
must	1
have	1
already	1
emerged	1
and	1
gone	1
seven	1
hundred	1
or	1
eight	1
hundred	1
leagues;	1
and	1
if	1
I	1
had	1
here	1
an	1
astrolabe	1
to	1
take	1
the	1
altitude	1
of	1
the	1
pole,	1
I	1
could	1
tell	1
thee	1
how	1
many	1
we	1
have	1
travelled,	1
though	1
either	1
I	1
know	1
little,	1
or	1
we	1
have	1
already	1
crossed	1
or	1
shall	1
shortly	1
cross	1
the	1
equinoctial	1
line	1
which	1
parts	1
the	1
two	1
opposite	1
poles	1
midway.”	1
“And	1
when	1
we	1
come	1
to	1
that	1
line	1
your	1
worship	1
speaks	1
of,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“how	1
far	1
shall	1
we	1
have	1
gone?”	1
“Very	1
far,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“for	1
of	1
the	1
three	1
hundred	1
and	1
sixty	1
degrees	1
that	1
this	1
terraqueous	1
globe	1
contains,	1
as	1
computed	1
by	1
Ptolemy,	1
the	1
greatest	1
cosmographer	1
known,	1
we	1
shall	1
have	1
travelled	1
one-half	1
when	1
we	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
line	1
I	1
spoke	1
of.”	1
“By	1
God,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“your	1
worship	1
gives	1
me	1
a	1
nice	1
authority	1
for	1
what	1
you	1
say,	1
putrid	1
Dolly	1
something	1
transmogrified,	1
or	1
whatever	1
it	1
is.”	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
laughed	1
at	1
the	1
interpretation	1
Sancho	1
put	1
upon	1
“computed,”	1
and	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
cosmographer	1
Ptolemy,	1
and	1
said	1
he,	1
“Thou	1
must	1
know,	1
Sancho,	1
that	1
with	1
the	1
Spaniards	1
and	1
those	1
who	1
embark	1
at	1
Cadiz	1
for	1
the	1
East	1
Indies,	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
signs	1
they	1
have	1
to	1
show	1
them	1
when	1
they	1
have	1
passed	1
the	1
equinoctial	1
line	1
I	1
told	1
thee	1
of,	1
is,	1
that	1
the	1
lice	1
die	1
upon	1
everybody	1
on	1
board	1
the	1
ship,	1
and	1
not	1
a	1
single	1
one	1
is	1
left,	1
or	1
to	1
be	1
found	1
in	1
the	1
whole	1
vessel	1
if	1
they	1
gave	1
its	1
weight	1
in	1
gold	1
for	1
it;	1
so,	1
Sancho,	1
thou	1
mayest	1
as	1
well	1
pass	1
thy	1
hand	1
down	1
thy	1
thigh,	1
and	1
if	1
thou	1
comest	1
upon	1
anything	1
alive	1
we	1
shall	1
be	1
no	1
longer	1
in	1
doubt;	1
if	1
not,	1
then	1
we	1
have	1
crossed.”	1
“I	1
don’t	1
believe	1
a	1
bit	1
of	1
it,”	1
said	1
Sancho;	1
“still,	1
I’ll	1
do	1
as	1
your	1
worship	1
bids	1
me;	1
though	1
I	1
don’t	1
know	1
what	1
need	1
there	1
is	1
for	1
trying	1
these	1
experiments,	1
for	1
I	1
can	1
see	1
with	1
my	1
own	1
eyes	1
that	1
we	1
have	1
not	1
moved	1
five	1
yards	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
bank,	1
or	1
shifted	1
two	1
yards	1
from	1
where	1
the	1
animals	1
stand,	1
for	1
there	1
are	1
Rocinante	1
and	1
Dapple	1
in	1
the	1
very	1
same	1
place	1
where	1
we	1
left	1
them;	1
and	1
watching	1
a	1
point,	1
as	1
I	1
do	1
now,	1
I	1
swear	1
by	1
all	1
that’s	1
good,	1
we	1
are	1
not	1
stirring	1
or	1
moving	1
at	1
the	1
pace	1
of	1
an	1
ant.”	1
“Try	1
the	1
test	1
I	1
told	1
thee	1
of,	1
Sancho,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“and	1
don’t	1
mind	1
any	1
other,	1
for	1
thou	1
knowest	1
nothing	1
about	1
colures,	1
lines,	1
parallels,	1
zodiacs,	1
ecliptics,	1
poles,	1
solstices,	1
equinoxes,	1
planets,	1
signs,	1
bearings,	1
the	1
measures	1
of	1
which	1
the	1
celestial	1
and	1
terrestrial	1
spheres	1
are	1
composed;	1
if	1
thou	1
wert	1
acquainted	1
with	1
all	1
these	1
things,	1
or	1
any	1
portion	1
of	1
them,	1
thou	1
wouldst	1
see	1
clearly	1
how	1
many	1
parallels	1
we	1
have	1
cut,	1
what	1
signs	1
we	1
have	1
seen,	1
and	1
what	1
constellations	1
we	1
have	1
left	1
behind	1
and	1
are	1
now	1
leaving	1
behind.	1
But	1
again	1
I	1
tell	1
thee,	1
feel	1
and	1
hunt,	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
certain	1
thou	1
art	1
cleaner	1
than	1
a	1
sheet	1
of	1
smooth	1
white	1
paper.”	1
Sancho	1
felt,	1
and	1
passing	1
his	1
hand	1
gently	1
and	1
carefully	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
hollow	1
of	1
his	1
left	1
knee,	1
he	1
looked	1
up	1
at	1
his	1
master	1
and	1
said,	1
“Either	1
the	1
test	1
is	1
a	1
false	1
one,	1
or	1
we	1
have	1
not	1
come	1
to	1
where	1
your	1
worship	1
says,	1
nor	1
within	1
many	1
leagues	1
of	1
it.”	1
“Why,	1
how	1
so?”	1
asked	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
“hast	1
thou	1
come	1
upon	1
aught?”	1
“Ay,	1
and	1
aughts,”	1
replied	1
Sancho;	1
and	1
shaking	1
his	1
fingers	1
he	1
washed	1
his	1
whole	1
hand	1
in	1
the	1
river	1
along	1
which	1
the	1
boat	1
was	1
quietly	1
gliding	1
in	1
midstream,	1
not	1
moved	1
by	1
any	1
occult	1
intelligence	1
or	1
invisible	1
enchanter,	1
but	1
simply	1
by	1
the	1
current,	1
just	1
there	1
smooth	1
and	1
gentle.	1
They	1
now	1
came	1
in	1
sight	1
of	1
some	1
large	1
water	1
mills	1
that	1
stood	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
river,	1
and	1
the	1
instant	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
saw	1
them	1
he	1
cried	1
out,	1
“Seest	1
thou	1
there,	1
my	1
friend?	1
there	1
stands	1
the	1
castle	1
or	1
fortress,	1
where	1
there	1
is,	1
no	1
doubt,	1
some	1
knight	1
in	1
durance,	1
or	1
ill-used	1
queen,	1
or	1
infanta,	1
or	1
princess,	1
in	1
whose	1
aid	1
I	1
am	1
brought	1
hither.”	1
“What	1
the	1
devil	1
city,	1
fortress,	1
or	1
castle	1
is	1
your	1
worship	1
talking	1
about,	1
señor?”	1
said	1
Sancho;	1
“don’t	1
you	1
see	1
that	1
those	1
are	1
mills	1
that	1
stand	1
in	1
the	1
river	1
to	1
grind	1
corn?”	1
“Hold	1
thy	1
peace,	1
Sancho,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
“though	1
they	1
look	1
like	1
mills	1
they	1
are	1
not	1
so;	1
I	1
have	1
already	1
told	1
thee	1
that	1
enchantments	1
transform	1
things	1
and	1
change	1
their	1
proper	1
shapes;	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
mean	1
to	1
say	1
they	1
really	1
change	1
them	1
from	1
one	1
form	1
into	1
another,	1
but	1
that	1
it	1
seems	1
as	1
though	1
they	1
did,	1
as	1
experience	1
proved	1
in	1
the	1
transformation	1
of	1
Dulcinea,	1
sole	1
refuge	1
of	1
my	1
hopes.”	1
By	1
this	1
time,	1
the	1
boat,	1
having	1
reached	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
stream,	1
began	1
to	1
move	1
less	1
slowly	1
than	1
hitherto.	1
The	1
millers	1
belonging	1
to	1
the	1
mills,	1
when	1
they	1
saw	1
the	1
boat	1
coming	1
down	1
the	1
river,	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
point	1
of	1
being	1
sucked	1
in	1
by	1
the	1
draught	1
of	1
the	1
wheels,	1
ran	1
out	1
in	1
haste,	1
several	1
of	1
them,	1
with	1
long	1
poles	1
to	1
stop	1
it,	1
and	1
being	1
all	1
mealy,	1
with	1
faces	1
and	1
garments	1
covered	1
with	1
flour,	1
they	1
presented	1
a	1
sinister	1
appearance.	1
They	1
raised	1
loud	1
shouts,	1
crying,	1
“Devils	1
of	1
men,	1
where	1
are	1
you	1
going	1
to?	1
Are	1
you	1
mad?	1
Do	1
you	1
want	1
to	1
drown	1
yourselves,	1
or	1
dash	1
yourselves	1
to	1
pieces	1
among	1
these	1
wheels?”	1
“Did	1
I	1
not	1
tell	1
thee,	1
Sancho,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
at	1
this,	1
“that	1
we	1
had	1
reached	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
I	1
am	1
to	1
show	1
what	1
the	1
might	1
of	1
my	1
arm	1
can	1
do?	1
See	1
what	1
ruffians	1
and	1
villains	1
come	1
out	1
against	1
me;	1
see	1
what	1
monsters	1
oppose	1
me;	1
see	1
what	1
hideous	1
countenances	1
come	1
to	1
frighten	1
us!	1
You	1
shall	1
soon	1
see,	1
scoundrels!”	1
And	1
then	1
standing	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
boat	1
he	1
began	1
in	1
a	1
loud	1
voice	1
to	1
hurl	1
threats	1
at	1
the	1
millers,	1
exclaiming,	1
“Ill-conditioned	1
and	1
worse-counselled	1
rabble,	1
restore	1
to	1
liberty	1
and	1
freedom	1
the	1
person	1
ye	1
hold	1
in	1
durance	1
in	1
this	1
your	1
fortress	1
or	1
prison,	1
high	1
or	1
low	1
or	1
of	1
whatever	1
rank	1
or	1
quality	1
he	1
be,	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
of	1
La	1
Mancha,	1
otherwise	1
called	1
the	1
Knight	1
of	1
the	1
Lions,	1
for	1
whom,	1
by	1
the	1
disposition	1
of	1
heaven	1
above,	1
it	1
is	1
reserved	1
to	1
give	1
a	1
happy	1
issue	1
to	1
this	1
adventure;”	1
and	1
so	1
saying	1
he	1
drew	1
his	1
sword	1
and	1
began	1
making	1
passes	1
in	1
the	1
air	1
at	1
the	1
millers,	1
who,	1
hearing	1
but	1
not	1
understanding	1
all	1
this	1
nonsense,	1
strove	1
to	1
stop	1
the	1
boat,	1
which	1
was	1
now	1
getting	1
into	1
the	1
rushing	1
channel	1
of	1
the	1
wheels.	1
Sancho	1
fell	1
upon	1
his	1
knees	1
devoutly	1
appealing	1
to	1
heaven	1
to	1
deliver	1
him	1
from	1
such	1
imminent	1
peril;	1
which	1
it	1
did	1
by	1
the	1
activity	1
and	1
quickness	1
of	1
the	1
millers,	1
who,	1
pushing	1
against	1
the	1
boat	1
with	1
their	1
poles,	1
stopped	1
it,	1
not,	1
however,	1
without	1
upsetting	1
and	1
throwing	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
and	1
Sancho	1
into	1
the	1
water;	1
and	1
lucky	1
it	1
was	1
for	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
swim	1
like	1
a	1
goose,	1
though	1
the	1
weight	1
of	1
his	1
armour	1
carried	1
him	1
twice	1
to	1
the	1
bottom;	1
and	1
had	1
it	1
not	1
been	1
for	1
the	1
millers,	1
who	1
plunged	1
in	1
and	1
hoisted	1
them	1
both	1
out,	1
it	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
Troy	1
town	1
with	1
the	1
pair	1
of	1
them.	1
As	1
soon	1
as,	1
more	1
drenched	1
than	1
thirsty,	1
they	1
were	1
landed,	1
Sancho	1
went	1
down	1
on	1
his	1
knees	1
and	1
with	1
clasped	1
hands	1
and	1
eyes	1
raised	1
to	1
heaven,	1
prayed	1
a	1
long	1
and	1
fervent	1
prayer	1
to	1
God	1
to	1
deliver	1
him	1
evermore	1
from	1
the	1
rash	1
projects	1
and	1
attempts	1
of	1
his	1
master.	1
The	1
fishermen,	1
the	1
owners	1
of	1
the	1
boat,	1
which	1
the	1
mill-wheels	1
had	1
knocked	1
to	1
pieces,	1
now	1
came	1
up,	1
and	1
seeing	1
it	1
smashed	1
they	1
proceeded	1
to	1
strip	1
Sancho	1
and	1
to	1
demand	1
payment	1
for	1
it	1
from	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
but	1
he	1
with	1
great	1
calmness,	1
just	1
as	1
if	1
nothing	1
had	1
happened	1
him,	1
told	1
the	1
millers	1
and	1
fishermen	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
pay	1
for	1
the	1
bark	1
most	1
cheerfully,	1
on	1
condition	1
that	1
they	1
delivered	1
up	1
to	1
him,	1
free	1
and	1
unhurt,	1
the	1
person	1
or	1
persons	1
that	1
were	1
in	1
durance	1
in	1
that	1
castle	1
of	1
theirs.	1

“What	1
persons	1
or	1
what	1
castle	1
art	1
thou	1
talking	1
of,	1
madman?	1
Art	1
thou	1
for	1
carrying	1
off	1
the	1
people	1
who	1
come	1
to	1
grind	1
corn	1
in	1
these	1
mills?”	1
“That’s	1
enough,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
to	1
himself,	1
“it	1
would	1
be	1
preaching	1
in	1
the	1
desert	1
to	1
attempt	1
by	1
entreaties	1
to	1
induce	1
this	1
rabble	1
to	1
do	1
any	1
virtuous	1
action.	1
In	1
this	1
adventure	1
two	1
mighty	1
enchanters	1
must	1
have	1
encountered	1
one	1
another,	1
and	1
one	1
frustrates	1
what	1
the	1
other	1
attempts;	1
one	1
provided	1
the	1
bark	1
for	1
me,	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
upset	1
me;	1
God	1
help	1
us,	1
this	1
world	1
is	1
all	1
machinations	1
and	1
schemes	1
at	1
cross	1
purposes	1
one	1
with	1
the	1
other.	1
I	1
can	1
do	1
no	1
more.”	1
And	1
then	1
turning	1
towards	1
the	1
mills	1
he	1
said	1
aloud,	1
“Friends,	1
whoe’er	1
ye	1
be	1
that	1
are	1
immured	1
in	1
that	1
prison,	1
forgive	1
me	1
that,	1
to	1
my	1
misfortune	1
and	1
yours,	1
I	1
cannot	1
deliver	1
you	1
from	1
your	1
misery;	1
this	1
adventure	1
is	1
doubtless	1
reserved	1
and	1
destined	1
for	1
some	1
other	1
knight.”	1
So	1
saying	1
he	1
settled	1
with	1
the	1
fishermen,	1
and	1
paid	1
fifty	1
reals	1
for	1
the	1
boat,	1
which	1
Sancho	1
handed	1
to	1
them	1
very	1
much	1
against	1
the	1
grain,	1
saying,	1
“With	1
a	1
couple	1
more	1
bark	1
businesses	1
like	1
this	1
we	1
shall	1
have	1
sunk	1
our	1
whole	1
capital.”	1
The	1
fishermen	1
and	1
the	1
millers	1
stood	1
staring	1
in	1
amazement	1
at	1
the	1
two	1
figures,	1
so	1
very	1
different	1
to	1
all	1
appearance	1
from	1
ordinary	1
men,	1
and	1
were	1
wholly	1
unable	1
to	1
make	1
out	1
the	1
drift	1
of	1
the	1
observations	1
and	1
questions	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
addressed	1
to	1
them;	1
and	1
coming	1
to	1
the	1
conclusion	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
madmen,	1
they	1
left	1
them	1
and	1
betook	1
themselves,	1
the	1
millers	1
to	1
their	1
mills,	1
and	1
the	1
fishermen	1
to	1
their	1
huts.	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
and	1
Sancho	1
returned	1
to	1
their	1
beasts,	1
and	1
to	1
their	1
life	1
of	1
beasts,	1
and	1
so	1
ended	1
the	1
adventure	1
of	1
the	1
enchanted	1
bark.	1

They	1
reached	1
their	1
beasts	1
in	1
low	1
spirits	1
and	1
bad	1
humour	1
enough,	1
knight	1
and	1
squire,	1
Sancho	1
particularly,	1
for	1
with	1
him	1
what	1
touched	1
the	1
stock	1
of	1
money	1
touched	1
his	1
heart,	1
and	1
when	1
any	1
was	1
taken	1
from	1
him	1
he	1
felt	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
was	1
robbed	1
of	1
the	1
apples	1
of	1
his	1
eyes.	1
In	1
fine,	1
without	1
exchanging	1
a	1
word,	1
they	1
mounted	1
and	1
quitted	1
the	1
famous	1
river,	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
absorbed	1
in	1
thoughts	1
of	1
his	1
love,	1
Sancho	1
in	1
thinking	1
of	1
his	1
advancement,	1
which	1
just	1
then,	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
him,	1
he	1
was	1
very	1
far	1
from	1
securing;	1
for,	1
fool	1
as	1
he	1
was,	1
he	1
saw	1
clearly	1
enough	1
that	1
his	1
master’s	1
acts	1
were	1
all	1
or	1
most	1
of	1
them	1
utterly	1
senseless;	1
and	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
cast	1
about	1
for	1
an	1
opportunity	1
of	1
retiring	1
from	1
his	1
service	1
and	1
going	1
home	1
some	1
day,	1
without	1
entering	1
into	1
any	1
explanations	1
or	1
taking	1
any	1
farewell	1
of	1
him.	1
Fortune,	1
however,	1
ordered	1
matters	1
after	1
a	1
fashion	1
very	1
much	1
the	1
opposite	1
of	1
what	1
he	1
contemplated.	1
It	1
so	1
happened	1
that	1
the	1
next	1
day	1
towards	1
sunset,	1
on	1
coming	1
out	1
of	1
a	1
wood,	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
cast	1
his	1
eyes	1
over	1
a	1
green	1
meadow,	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
far	1
end	1
of	1
it	1
observed	1
some	1
people,	1
and	1
as	1
he	1
drew	1
nearer	1
saw	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
hawking	1
party.	1
Coming	1
closer,	1
he	1
distinguished	1
among	1
them	1
a	1
lady	1
of	1
graceful	1
mien,	1
on	1
a	1
pure	1
white	1
palfrey	1
or	1
hackney	1
caparisoned	1
with	1
green	1
trappings	1
and	1
a	1
silver-mounted	1
side-saddle.	1
The	1
lady	1
was	1
also	1
in	1
green,	1
and	1
so	1
richly	1
and	1
splendidly	1
dressed	1
that	1
splendour	1
itself	1
seemed	1
personified	1
in	1
her.	1
On	1
her	1
left	1
hand	1
she	1
bore	1
a	1
hawk,	1
a	1
proof	1
to	1
Don	1
Quixote’s	1
mind	1
that	1
she	1
must	1
be	1
some	1
great	1
lady	1
and	1
the	1
mistress	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
hunting	1
party,	1
which	1
was	1
the	1
fact;	1
so	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
Sancho,	1
“Run	1
Sancho,	1
my	1
son,	1
and	1
say	1
to	1
that	1
lady	1
on	1
the	1
palfrey	1
with	1
the	1
hawk	1
that	1
I,	1
the	1
Knight	1
of	1
the	1
Lions,	1
kiss	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
her	1
exalted	1
beauty,	1
and	1
if	1
her	1
excellence	1
will	1
grant	1
me	1
leave	1
I	1
will	1
go	1
and	1
kiss	1
them	1
in	1
person	1
and	1
place	1
myself	1
at	1
her	1
service	1
for	1
aught	1
that	1
may	1
be	1
in	1
my	1
power	1
and	1
her	1
highness	1
may	1
command;	1
and	1
mind,	1
Sancho,	1
how	1
thou	1
speakest,	1
and	1
take	1
care	1
not	1
to	1
thrust	1
in	1
any	1
of	1
thy	1
proverbs	1
into	1
thy	1
message.”	1

“You’ve	1
got	1
a	1
likely	1
one	1
here	1
to	1
thrust	1
any	1
in!”	1
said	1
Sancho;	1
“leave	1
me	1
alone	1
for	1
that!	1
Why,	1
this	1
is	1
not	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
in	1
my	1
life	1
I	1
have	1
carried	1
messages	1
to	1
high	1
and	1
exalted	1
ladies.”	1
“Except	1
that	1
thou	1
didst	1
carry	1
to	1
the	1
lady	1
Dulcinea,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“I	1
know	1
not	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
carried	1
any	1
other,	1
at	1
least	1
in	1
my	1
service.”	1
“That	1
is	1
true,”	1
replied	1
Sancho;	1
“but	1
pledges	1
don’t	1
distress	1
a	1
good	1
payer,	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
house	1
where	1
there’s	1
plenty	1
supper	1
is	1
soon	1
cooked;	1
I	1
mean	1
there’s	1
no	1
need	1
of	1
telling	1
or	1
warning	1
me	1
about	1
anything;	1
for	1
I’m	1
ready	1
for	1
everything	1
and	1
know	1
a	1
little	1
of	1
everything.”	1
“That	1
I	1
believe,	1
Sancho,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
“go	1
and	1
good	1
luck	1
to	1
thee,	1
and	1
God	1
speed	1
thee.”	1
Sancho	1
went	1
off	1
at	1
top	1
speed,	1
forcing	1
Dapple	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
regular	1
pace,	1
and	1
came	1
to	1
where	1
the	1
fair	1
huntress	1
was	1
standing,	1
and	1
dismounting	1
knelt	1
before	1
her	1
and	1
said,	1
“Fair	1
lady,	1
that	1
knight	1
that	1
you	1
see	1
there,	1
the	1
Knight	1
of	1
the	1
Lions	1
by	1
name,	1
is	1
my	1
master,	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
squire	1
of	1
his,	1
and	1
at	1
home	1
they	1
call	1
me	1
Sancho	1
Panza.	1
This	1
same	1
Knight	1
of	1
the	1
Lions,	1
who	1
was	1
called	1
not	1
long	1
since	1
the	1
Knight	1
of	1
the	1
Rueful	1
Countenance,	1
sends	1
by	1
me	1
to	1
say	1
may	1
it	1
please	1
your	1
highness	1
to	1
give	1
him	1
leave	1
that,	1
with	1
your	1
permission,	1
approbation,	1
and	1
consent,	1
he	1
may	1
come	1
and	1
carry	1
out	1
his	1
wishes,	1
which	1
are,	1
as	1
he	1
says	1
and	1
I	1
believe,	1
to	1
serve	1
your	1
exalted	1
loftiness	1
and	1
beauty;	1
and	1
if	1
you	1
give	1
it,	1
your	1
ladyship	1
will	1
do	1
a	1
thing	1
which	1
will	1
redound	1
to	1
your	1
honour,	1
and	1
he	1
will	1
receive	1
a	1
most	1
distinguished	1
favour	1
and	1
happiness.”	1
“You	1
have	1
indeed,	1
squire,”	1
said	1
the	1
lady,	1
“delivered	1
your	1
message	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
formalities	1
such	1
messages	1
require;	1
rise	1
up,	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
right	1
that	1
the	1
squire	1
of	1
a	1
knight	1
so	1
great	1
as	1
he	1
of	1
the	1
Rueful	1
Countenance,	1
of	1
whom	1
we	1
have	1
heard	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
here,	1
should	1
remain	1
on	1
his	1
knees;	1
rise,	1
my	1
friend,	1
and	1
bid	1
your	1
master	1
welcome	1
to	1
the	1
services	1
of	1
myself	1
and	1
the	1
duke	1
my	1
husband,	1
in	1
a	1
country	1
house	1
we	1
have	1
here.”	1
Sancho	1
got	1
up,	1
charmed	1
as	1
much	1
by	1
the	1
beauty	1
of	1
the	1
good	1
lady	1
as	1
by	1
her	1
high-bred	1
air	1
and	1
her	1
courtesy,	1
but,	1
above	1
all,	1
by	1
what	1
she	1
had	1
said	1
about	1
having	1
heard	1
of	1
his	1
master,	1
the	1
Knight	1
of	1
the	1
Rueful	1
Countenance;	1
for	1
if	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
call	1
him	1
Knight	1
of	1
the	1
Lions	1
it	1
was	1
no	1
doubt	1
because	1
he	1
had	1
so	1
lately	1
taken	1
the	1
name.	1
“Tell	1
me,	1
brother	1
squire,”	1
asked	1
the	1
duchess	1
(whose	1
title,	1
however,	1
is	1
not	1
known),	1
“this	1
master	1
of	1
yours,	1
is	1
he	1
not	1
one	1
of	1
whom	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
history	1
extant	1
in	1
print,	1
called	1
‘The	1
Ingenious	1
Gentleman,	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
of	1
La	1
Mancha,’	1
who	1
has	1
for	1
the	1
lady	1
of	1
his	1
heart	1
a	1
certain	1
Dulcinea	1
del	1
Toboso?”	1
“He	1
is	1
the	1
same,	1
señora,”	1
replied	1
Sancho;	1
“and	1
that	1
squire	1
of	1
his	1
who	1
figures,	1
or	1
ought	1
to	1
figure,	1
in	1
the	1
said	1
history	1
under	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Sancho	1
Panza,	1
is	1
myself,	1
unless	1
they	1
have	1
changed	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
cradle,	1
I	1
mean	1
in	1
the	1
press.”	1
“I	1
am	1
rejoiced	1
at	1
all	1
this,”	1
said	1
the	1
duchess;	1
“go,	1
brother	1
Panza,	1
and	1
tell	1
your	1
master	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
welcome	1
to	1
my	1
estate,	1
and	1
that	1
nothing	1
could	1
happen	1
to	1
me	1
that	1
could	1
give	1
me	1
greater	1
pleasure.”	1
Sancho	1
returned	1
to	1
his	1
master	1
mightily	1
pleased	1
with	1
this	1
gratifying	1
answer,	1
and	1
told	1
him	1
all	1
the	1
great	1
lady	1
had	1
said	1
to	1
him,	1
lauding	1
to	1
the	1
skies,	1
in	1
his	1
rustic	1
phrase,	1
her	1
rare	1
beauty,	1
her	1
graceful	1
gaiety,	1
and	1
her	1
courtesy.	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
drew	1
himself	1
up	1
briskly	1
in	1
his	1
saddle,	1
fixed	1
himself	1
in	1
his	1
stirrups,	1
settled	1
his	1
visor,	1
gave	1
Rocinante	1
the	1
spur,	1
and	1
with	1
an	1
easy	1
bearing	1
advanced	1
to	1
kiss	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
the	1
duchess,	1
who,	1
having	1
sent	1
to	1
summon	1
the	1
duke	1
her	1
husband,	1
told	1
him	1
while	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
was	1
approaching	1
all	1
about	1
the	1
message;	1
and	1
as	1
both	1
of	1
them	1
had	1
read	1
the	1
First	1
Part	1
of	1
this	1
history,	1
and	1
from	1
it	1
were	1
aware	1
of	1
Don	1
Quixote’s	1
crazy	1
turn,	1
they	1
awaited	1
him	1
with	1
the	1
greatest	1
delight	1
and	1
anxiety	1
to	1
make	1
his	1
acquaintance,	1
meaning	1
to	1
fall	1
in	1
with	1
his	1
humour	1
and	1
agree	1
with	1
everything	1
he	1
said,	1
and,	1
so	1
long	1
as	1
he	1
stayed	1
with	1
them,	1
to	1
treat	1
him	1
as	1
a	1
knight-errant,	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
ceremonies	1
usual	1
in	1
the	1
books	1
of	1
chivalry	1
they	1
had	1
read,	1
for	1
they	1
themselves	1
were	1
very	1
fond	1
of	1
them.	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
now	1
came	1
up	1
with	1
his	1
visor	1
raised,	1
and	1
as	1
he	1
seemed	1
about	1
to	1
dismount	1
Sancho	1
made	1
haste	1
to	1
go	1
and	1
hold	1
his	1
stirrup	1
for	1
him;	1
but	1
in	1
getting	1
down	1
off	1
Dapple	1
he	1
was	1
so	1
unlucky	1
as	1
to	1
hitch	1
his	1
foot	1
in	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
ropes	1
of	1
the	1
pack-saddle	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
way	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
unable	1
to	1
free	1
it,	1
and	1
was	1
left	1
hanging	1
by	1
it	1
with	1
his	1
face	1
and	1
breast	1
on	1
the	1
ground.	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
who	1
was	1
not	1
used	1
to	1
dismount	1
without	1
having	1
the	1
stirrup	1
held,	1
fancying	1
that	1
Sancho	1
had	1
by	1
this	1
time	1
come	1
to	1
hold	1
it	1
for	1
him,	1
threw	1
himself	1
off	1
with	1
a	1
lurch	1
and	1
brought	1
Rocinante’s	1
saddle	1
after	1
him,	1
which	1
was	1
no	1
doubt	1
badly	1
girthed,	1
and	1
saddle	1
and	1
he	1
both	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
ground;	1
not	1
without	1
discomfiture	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
abundant	1
curses	1
muttered	1
between	1
his	1
teeth	1
against	1
the	1
unlucky	1
Sancho,	1
who	1
had	1
his	1
foot	1
still	1
in	1
the	1
shackles.	1
The	1
duke	1
ordered	1
his	1
huntsmen	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
help	1
of	1
knight	1
and	1
squire,	1
and	1
they	1
raised	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
sorely	1
shaken	1
by	1
his	1
fall;	1
and	1
he,	1
limping,	1
advanced	1
as	1
best	1
he	1
could	1
to	1
kneel	1
before	1
the	1
noble	1
pair.	1
This,	1
however,	1
the	1
duke	1
would	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
permit;	1
on	1
the	1
contrary,	1
dismounting	1
from	1
his	1
horse,	1
he	1
went	1
and	1
embraced	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
saying,	1
“I	1
am	1
grieved,	1
Sir	1
Knight	1
of	1
the	1
Rueful	1
Countenance,	1
that	1
your	1
first	1
experience	1
on	1
my	1
ground	1
should	1
have	1
been	1
such	1
an	1
unfortunate	1
one	1
as	1
we	1
have	1
seen;	1
but	1
the	1
carelessness	1
of	1
squires	1
is	1
often	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
worse	1
accidents.”	1
“That	1
which	1
has	1
happened	1
me	1
in	1
meeting	1
you,	1
mighty	1
prince,”	1
replied	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“cannot	1
be	1
unfortunate,	1
even	1
if	1
my	1
fall	1
had	1
not	1
stopped	1
short	1
of	1
the	1
depths	1
of	1
the	1
bottomless	1
pit,	1
for	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
having	1
seen	1
you	1
would	1
have	1
lifted	1
me	1
up	1
and	1
delivered	1
me	1
from	1
it.	1
My	1
squire,	1
God’s	1
curse	1
upon	1
him,	1
is	1
better	1
at	1
unloosing	1
his	1
tongue	1
in	1
talking	1
impertinence	1
than	1
in	1
tightening	1
the	1
girths	1
of	1
a	1
saddle	1
to	1
keep	1
it	1
steady;	1
but	1
however	1
I	1
may	1
be,	1
fallen	1
or	1
raised	1
up,	1
on	1
foot	1
or	1
on	1
horseback,	1
I	1
shall	1
always	1
be	1
at	1
your	1
service	1
and	1
that	1
of	1
my	1
lady	1
the	1
duchess,	1
your	1
worthy	1
consort,	1
worthy	1
queen	1
of	1
beauty	1
and	1
paramount	1
princess	1
of	1
courtesy.”	1
“Gently,	1
Señor	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
of	1
La	1
Mancha,”	1
said	1
the	1
duke;	1
“where	1
my	1
lady	1
Doña	1
Dulcinea	1
del	1
Toboso	1
is,	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
right	1
that	1
other	1
beauties	1
should	1
be	1
praised.”	1
Sancho,	1
by	1
this	1
time	1
released	1
from	1
his	1
entanglement,	1
was	1
standing	1
by,	1
and	1
before	1
his	1
master	1
could	1
answer	1
he	1
said,	1
“There	1
is	1
no	1
denying,	1
and	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
maintained,	1
that	1
my	1
lady	1
Dulcinea	1
del	1
Toboso	1
is	1
very	1
beautiful;	1
but	1
the	1
hare	1
jumps	1
up	1
where	1
one	1
least	1
expects	1
it;	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
heard	1
say	1
that	1
what	1
we	1
call	1
nature	1
is	1
like	1
a	1
potter	1
that	1
makes	1
vessels	1
of	1
clay,	1
and	1
he	1
who	1
makes	1
one	1
fair	1
vessel	1
can	1
as	1
well	1
make	1
two,	1
or	1
three,	1
or	1
a	1
hundred;	1
I	1
say	1
so	1
because,	1
by	1
my	1
faith,	1
my	1
lady	1
the	1
duchess	1
is	1
in	1
no	1
way	1
behind	1
my	1
mistress	1
the	1
lady	1
Dulcinea	1
del	1
Toboso.”	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
turned	1
to	1
the	1
duchess	1
and	1
said,	1
“Your	1
highness	1
may	1
conceive	1
that	1
never	1
had	1
knight-errant	1
in	1
this	1
world	1
a	1
more	1
talkative	1
or	1
a	1
droller	1
squire	1
than	1
I	1
have,	1
and	1
he	1
will	1
prove	1
the	1
truth	1
of	1
what	1
I	1
say,	1
if	1
your	1
highness	1
is	1
pleased	1
to	1
accept	1
of	1
my	1
services	1
for	1
a	1
few	1
days.”	1
To	1
which	1
the	1
duchess	1
made	1
answer,	1
“that	1
worthy	1
Sancho	1
is	1
droll	1
I	1
consider	1
a	1
very	1
good	1
thing,	1
because	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
sign	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
shrewd;	1
for	1
drollery	1
and	1
sprightliness,	1
Señor	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
as	1
you	1
very	1
well	1
know,	1
do	1
not	1
take	1
up	1
their	1
abode	1
with	1
dull	1
wits;	1
and	1
as	1
good	1
Sancho	1
is	1
droll	1
and	1
sprightly	1
I	1
here	1
set	1
him	1
down	1
as	1
shrewd.”	1
“And	1
talkative,”	1
added	1
Don	1
Quixote.	1
“So	1
much	1
the	1
better,”	1
said	1
the	1
duke,	1
“for	1
many	1
droll	1
things	1
cannot	1
be	1
said	1
in	1
few	1
words;	1
but	1
not	1
to	1
lose	1
time	1
in	1
talking,	1
come,	1
great	1
Knight	1
of	1
the	1
Rueful	1
Countenance—”	1
“Of	1
the	1
Lions,	1
your	1
highness	1
must	1
say,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“for	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
Rueful	1
Countenance	1
nor	1
any	1
such	1
character	1
now.”	1
“He	1
of	1
the	1
Lions	1
be	1
it,”	1
continued	1
the	1
duke;	1
“I	1
say,	1
let	1
Sir	1
Knight	1
of	1
the	1
Lions	1
come	1
to	1
a	1
castle	1
of	1
mine	1
close	1
by,	1
where	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
given	1
that	1
reception	1
which	1
is	1
due	1
to	1
so	1
exalted	1
a	1
personage,	1
and	1
which	1
the	1
duchess	1
and	1
I	1
are	1
wont	1
to	1
give	1
to	1
all	1
knights-errant	1
who	1
come	1
there.”	1
By	1
this	1
time	1
Sancho	1
had	1
fixed	1
and	1
girthed	1
Rocinante’s	1
saddle,	1
and	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
having	1
got	1
on	1
his	1
back	1
and	1
the	1
duke	1
mounted	1
a	1
fine	1
horse,	1
they	1
placed	1
the	1
duchess	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
and	1
set	1
out	1
for	1
the	1
castle.	1
The	1
duchess	1
desired	1
Sancho	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
her	1
side,	1
for	1
she	1
found	1
infinite	1
enjoyment	1
in	1
listening	1
to	1
his	1
shrewd	1
remarks.	1
Sancho	1
required	1
no	1
pressing,	1
but	1
pushed	1
himself	1
in	1
between	1
them	1
and	1
the	1
duke,	1
who	1
thought	1
it	1
rare	1
good	1
fortune	1
to	1
receive	1
such	1
a	1
knight-errant	1
and	1
such	1
a	1
homely	1
squire	1
in	1
their	1
castle.	1

was	1
the	1
satisfaction	1
that	1
Sancho	1
felt	1
at	1
seeing	1
himself,	1
as	1
it	1
seemed,	1
an	1
established	1
favourite	1
with	1
the	1
duchess,	1
for	1
he	1
looked	1
forward	1
to	1
finding	1
in	1
her	1
castle	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
found	1
in	1
Don	1
Diego’s	1
house	1
and	1
in	1
Basilio’s;	1
he	1
was	1
always	1
fond	1
of	1
good	1
living,	1
and	1
always	1
seized	1
by	1
the	1
forelock	1
any	1
opportunity	1
of	1
feasting	1
himself	1
whenever	1
it	1
presented	1
itself.	1
The	1
history	1
informs	1
us,	1
then,	1
that	1
before	1
they	1
reached	1
the	1
country	1
house	1
or	1
castle,	1
the	1
duke	1
went	1
on	1
in	1
advance	1
and	1
instructed	1
all	1
his	1
servants	1
how	1
they	1
were	1
to	1
treat	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
and	1
so	1
the	1
instant	1
he	1
came	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
castle	1
gates	1
with	1
the	1
duchess,	1
two	1
lackeys	1
or	1
equerries,	1
clad	1
in	1
what	1
they	1
call	1
morning	1

in	1

before	1
he	1

heard	1
them,	1

him,	1
“Your	1

my	1
lady	1

her	1
horse.”	1

Don	1
Quixote	1
obeyed,	1
and	1
great	1
bandying	1
of	1
compliments	1
followed	1
between	1
the	1
two	1
over	1
the	1
matter;	1
but	1
in	1
the	1
end	1
the	1
duchess’s	1
determination	1
carried	1
the	1
day,	1
and	1
she	1
refused	1
to	1
get	1
down	1
or	1
dismount	1
from	1
her	1
palfrey	1
except	1
in	1
the	1
arms	1
of	1
the	1
duke,	1
saying	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
consider	1
herself	1
worthy	1
to	1
impose	1
so	1
unnecessary	1
a	1
burden	1
on	1
so	1
great	1
a	1
knight.	1
At	1
length	1
the	1
duke	1
came	1
out	1
to	1
take	1
her	1
down,	1
and	1
as	1
they	1
entered	1
a	1
spacious	1
court	1
two	1
fair	1
damsels	1
came	1
forward	1
and	1
threw	1
over	1
Don	1
Quixote’s	1
shoulders	1
a	1
large	1
mantle	1
of	1
the	1
finest	1
scarlet	1
cloth,	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
instant	1
all	1
the	1
galleries	1
of	1
the	1
court	1
were	1
lined	1
with	1
the	1
men-servants	1
and	1
women-servants	1
of	1
the	1
household,	1
crying,	1
“Welcome,	1
flower	1
and	1
cream	1
of	1
knight-errantry!”	1
while	1
all	1
or	1
most	1
of	1
them	1
flung	1
pellets	1
filled	1
with	1
scented	1
water	1
over	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
and	1
the	1
duke	1
and	1
duchess;	1
at	1
all	1
which	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
was	1
greatly	1
astonished,	1
and	1
this	1
was	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
that	1
he	1
thoroughly	1
felt	1
and	1
believed	1
himself	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
knight-errant	1
in	1
reality	1
and	1
not	1
merely	1
in	1
fancy,	1
now	1
that	1
he	1
saw	1
himself	1
treated	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
way	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
read	1
of	1
such	1
knights	1
being	1
treated	1
in	1
days	1
of	1
yore.	1
Sancho,	1
deserting	1
Dapple,	1
hung	1
on	1
to	1
the	1
duchess	1
and	1
entered	1
the	1
castle,	1
but	1
feeling	1
some	1
twinges	1
of	1
conscience	1
at	1
having	1
left	1
the	1
ass	1
alone,	1
he	1
approached	1
a	1
respectable	1
duenna	1
who	1
had	1
come	1
out	1
with	1
the	1
rest	1
to	1
receive	1
the	1
duchess,	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
low	1
voice	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
her,	1
“Señora	1
Gonzalez,	1
or	1
however	1
your	1
grace	1
may	1
be	1
called—”	1
“I	1
am	1
called	1
Doña	1
Rodriguez	1
de	1
Grijalba,”	1
replied	1
the	1
duenna;	1
“what	1
is	1
your	1
will,	1
brother?”	1
To	1
which	1
Sancho	1
made	1
answer,	1
“I	1
should	1
be	1
glad	1
if	1
your	1
worship	1
would	1
do	1
me	1
the	1
favour	1
to	1
go	1
out	1
to	1
the	1
castle	1
gate,	1
where	1
you	1
will	1
find	1
a	1
grey	1
ass	1
of	1
mine;	1
make	1
them,	1
if	1
you	1
please,	1
put	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
stable,	1
or	1
put	1
him	1
there	1
yourself,	1
for	1
the	1
poor	1
little	1
beast	1
is	1
rather	1
easily	1
frightened,	1
and	1
cannot	1
bear	1
being	1
alone	1
at	1
all.”	1
“If	1
the	1
master	1
is	1
as	1
wise	1
as	1
the	1
man,”	1
said	1
the	1
duenna,	1
“we	1
have	1
got	1
a	1
fine	1
bargain.	1
Be	1
off	1
with	1
you,	1
brother,	1
and	1
bad	1
luck	1
to	1
you	1
and	1
him	1
who	1
brought	1
you	1
here;	1
go,	1
look	1
after	1
your	1
ass,	1
for	1
we,	1
the	1
duennas	1
of	1
this	1
house,	1
are	1
not	1
used	1
to	1
work	1
of	1
that	1
sort.”	1
“Well	1
then,	1
in	1
troth,”	1
returned	1
Sancho,	1
“I	1
have	1
heard	1
my	1
master,	1
who	1
is	1
the	1
very	1
treasure-finder	1
of	1
stories,	1
telling	1
the	1
story	1
of	1
Lancelot	1
when	1
he	1
came	1
from	1
Britain,	1
say	1
that	1
ladies	1
waited	1
upon	1
him	1
and	1
duennas	1
upon	1
his	1
hack;	1
and,	1
if	1
it	1
comes	1
to	1
my	1
ass,	1
I	1
wouldn’t	1
change	1
him	1
for	1
Señor	1
Lancelot’s	1
hack.”	1
“If	1
you	1
are	1
a	1
jester,	1
brother,”	1
said	1
the	1
duenna,	1
“keep	1
your	1
drolleries	1
for	1
some	1
place	1
where	1
they’ll	1
pass	1
muster	1
and	1
be	1
paid	1
for;	1
for	1
you’ll	1
get	1
nothing	1
from	1
me	1
but	1
a	1
fig.”	1
“At	1
any	1
rate,	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
a	1
very	1
ripe	1
one,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“for	1
you	1
won’t	1
lose	1
the	1
trick	1
in	1
years	1
by	1
a	1
point	1
too	1
little.”	1
“Son	1
of	1
a	1
bitch,”	1
said	1
the	1
duenna,	1
all	1
aglow	1
with	1
anger,	1
“whether	1
I’m	1
old	1
or	1
not,	1
it’s	1
with	1
God	1
I	1
have	1
to	1
reckon,	1
not	1
with	1
you,	1
you	1
garlic-stuffed	1
scoundrel!”	1
and	1
she	1
said	1
it	1
so	1
loud,	1
that	1
the	1
duchess	1
heard	1
it,	1
and	1
turning	1
round	1
and	1
seeing	1
the	1
duenna	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
state	1
of	1
excitement,	1
and	1
her	1
eyes	1
flaming	1
so,	1
asked	1
whom	1
she	1
was	1
wrangling	1
with.	1
“With	1
this	1
good	1
fellow	1
here,”	1
said	1
the	1
duenna,	1
“who	1
has	1
particularly	1
requested	1
me	1
to	1
go	1
and	1
put	1
an	1
ass	1
of	1
his	1
that	1
is	1
at	1
the	1
castle	1
gate	1
into	1
the	1
stable,	1
holding	1
it	1
up	1
to	1
me	1
as	1
an	1
example	1
that	1
they	1
did	1
the	1
same	1
I	1
don’t	1
know	1
where—that	1
some	1
ladies	1
waited	1
on	1
one	1
Lancelot,	1
and	1
duennas	1
on	1
his	1
hack;	1
and	1
what	1
is	1
more,	1
to	1
wind	1
up	1
with,	1
he	1
called	1
me	1
old.”	1
“That,”	1
said	1
the	1
duchess,	1
“I	1
should	1
have	1
considered	1
the	1
greatest	1
affront	1
that	1
could	1
be	1
offered	1
me;”	1
and	1
addressing	1
Sancho,	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
him,	1
“You	1
must	1
know,	1
friend	1
Sancho,	1
that	1
Doña	1
Rodriguez	1
is	1
very	1
youthful,	1
and	1
that	1
she	1
wears	1
that	1
hood	1
more	1
for	1
authority	1
and	1
custom’s	1
sake	1
than	1
because	1
of	1
her	1
years.”	1
“May	1
all	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
mine	1
be	1
unlucky,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“if	1
I	1
meant	1
it	1
that	1
way;	1
I	1
only	1
spoke	1
because	1
the	1
affection	1
I	1
have	1
for	1
my	1
ass	1
is	1
so	1
great,	1
and	1
I	1
thought	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
commend	1
him	1
to	1
a	1
more	1
kind-hearted	1
person	1
than	1
the	1
lady	1
Doña	1
Rodriguez.”	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
who	1
was	1
listening,	1
said	1
to	1
him,	1
“Is	1
this	1
proper	1
conversation	1
for	1
the	1
place,	1
Sancho?”	1
“Señor,”	1
replied	1
Sancho,	1
“every	1
one	1
must	1
mention	1
what	1
he	1
wants	1
wherever	1
he	1
may	1
be;	1
I	1
thought	1
of	1
Dapple	1
here,	1
and	1
I	1
spoke	1
of	1
him	1
here;	1
if	1
I	1
had	1
thought	1
of	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
stable	1
I	1
would	1
have	1
spoken	1
there.”	1
On	1
which	1
the	1
duke	1
observed,	1
“Sancho	1
is	1
quite	1
right,	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
reason	1
at	1
all	1
to	1
find	1
fault	1
with	1
him;	1
Dapple	1
shall	1
be	1
fed	1
to	1
his	1
heart’s	1
content,	1
and	1
Sancho	1
may	1
rest	1
easy,	1
for	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
treated	1
like	1
himself.”	1
While	1
this	1
conversation,	1
amusing	1
to	1
all	1
except	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
was	1
proceeding,	1
they	1
ascended	1
the	1
staircase	1
and	1
ushered	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
into	1
a	1
chamber	1
hung	1
with	1
rich	1
cloth	1
of	1
gold	1
and	1
brocade;	1
six	1
damsels	1
relieved	1
him	1
of	1
his	1
armour	1
and	1
waited	1
on	1
him	1
like	1
pages,	1
all	1
of	1
them	1
prepared	1
and	1
instructed	1
by	1
the	1
duke	1
and	1
duchess	1
as	1
to	1
what	1
they	1
were	1
to	1
do,	1
and	1
how	1
they	1
were	1
to	1
treat	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
see	1
and	1
believe	1
they	1
were	1
treating	1
him	1
like	1
a	1
knight-errant.	1
When	1
his	1
armour	1
was	1
removed,	1
there	1
stood	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
in	1
his	1
tight-fitting	1
breeches	1
and	1
chamois	1
doublet,	1
lean,	1
lanky,	1
and	1
long,	1
with	1
cheeks	1
that	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
kissing	1
each	1
other	1
inside;	1
such	1
a	1
figure,	1
that	1
if	1
the	1
damsels	1
waiting	1
on	1
him	1
had	1
not	1
taken	1
care	1
to	1
check	1
their	1
merriment	1
(which	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
particular	1
directions	1
their	1
master	1
and	1
mistress	1
had	1
given	1
them),	1
they	1
would	1
have	1
burst	1
with	1
laughter.	1
They	1
asked	1
him	1
to	1
let	1
himself	1
be	1
stripped	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
put	1
a	1
shirt	1
on	1
him,	1
but	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
on	1
any	1
account,	1
saying	1
that	1
modesty	1
became	1
knights-errant	1
just	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
valour.	1
However,	1
he	1
said	1
they	1
might	1
give	1
the	1
shirt	1
to	1
Sancho;	1
and	1
shutting	1
himself	1
in	1
with	1
him	1
in	1
a	1
room	1
where	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
sumptuous	1
bed,	1
he	1
undressed	1
and	1
put	1
on	1
the	1
shirt;	1
and	1
then,	1
finding	1
himself	1
alone	1
with	1
Sancho,	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
him,	1
“Tell	1
me,	1
thou	1
new-fledged	1
buffoon	1
and	1
old	1
booby,	1
dost	1
thou	1
think	1
it	1
right	1
to	1
offend	1
and	1
insult	1
a	1
duenna	1
so	1
deserving	1
of	1
reverence	1
and	1
respect	1
as	1
that	1
one	1
just	1
now?	1
Was	1
that	1
a	1
time	1
to	1
bethink	1
thee	1
of	1
thy	1
Dapple,	1
or	1
are	1
these	1
noble	1
personages	1
likely	1
to	1
let	1
the	1
beasts	1
fare	1
badly	1
when	1
they	1
treat	1
their	1
owners	1
in	1
such	1
elegant	1
style?	1
For	1
God’s	1
sake,	1
Sancho,	1
restrain	1
thyself,	1
and	1
don’t	1
show	1
the	1
thread	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
let	1
them	1
see	1
what	1
a	1
coarse,	1
boorish	1
texture	1
thou	1
art	1
of.	1
Remember,	1
sinner	1
that	1
thou	1
art,	1
the	1
master	1
is	1
the	1
more	1
esteemed	1
the	1
more	1
respectable	1
and	1
well-bred	1
his	1
servants	1
are;	1
and	1
that	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
greatest	1
advantages	1
that	1
princes	1
have	1
over	1
other	1
men	1
is	1
that	1
they	1
have	1
servants	1
as	1
good	1
as	1
themselves	1
to	1
wait	1
on	1
them.	1
Dost	1
thou	1
not	1
see—shortsighted	1
being	1
that	1
thou	1
art,	1
and	1
unlucky	1
mortal	1
that	1
I	1
am!—that	1
if	1
they	1
perceive	1
thee	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
coarse	1
clown	1
or	1
a	1
dull	1
blockhead,	1
they	1
will	1
suspect	1
me	1
to	1
be	1
some	1
impostor	1
or	1
swindler?	1
Nay,	1
nay,	1
Sancho	1
friend,	1
keep	1
clear,	1
oh,	1
keep	1
clear	1
of	1
these	1
stumbling-blocks;	1
for	1
he	1
who	1
falls	1
into	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
being	1
a	1
chatterbox	1
and	1
droll,	1
drops	1
into	1
a	1
wretched	1
buffoon	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
he	1
trips;	1
bridle	1
thy	1
tongue,	1
consider	1
and	1
weigh	1
thy	1
words	1
before	1
they	1
escape	1
thy	1
mouth,	1
and	1
bear	1
in	1
mind	1
we	1
are	1
now	1
in	1
quarters	1
whence,	1
by	1
God’s	1
help,	1
and	1
the	1
strength	1
of	1
my	1
arm,	1
we	1
shall	1
come	1
forth	1
mightily	1
advanced	1
in	1
fame	1
and	1
fortune.”	1
Sancho	1
promised	1
him	1
with	1
much	1
earnestness	1
to	1
keep	1
his	1
mouth	1
shut,	1
and	1
to	1
bite	1
off	1
his	1
tongue	1
before	1
he	1
uttered	1
a	1
word	1
that	1
was	1
not	1
altogether	1
to	1
the	1
purpose	1
and	1
well	1
considered,	1
and	1
told	1
him	1
he	1
might	1
make	1
his	1
mind	1
easy	1
on	1
that	1
point,	1
for	1
it	1
should	1
never	1
be	1
discovered	1
through	1
him	1
what	1
they	1
were.	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
dressed	1
himself,	1
put	1
on	1
his	1
baldric	1
with	1
his	1
sword,	1
threw	1
the	1
scarlet	1
mantle	1
over	1
his	1
shoulders,	1
placed	1
on	1
his	1
head	1
a	1
montera	1
of	1
green	1
satin	1
that	1
the	1
damsels	1
had	1
given	1
him,	1
and	1
thus	1
arrayed	1
passed	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
large	1
room,	1
where	1
he	1
found	1
the	1
damsels	1
drawn	1
up	1
in	1
double	1
file,	1
the	1
same	1
number	1
on	1
each	1
side,	1
all	1
with	1
the	1
appliances	1
for	1
washing	1
the	1
hands,	1
which	1
they	1
presented	1
to	1
him	1
with	1
profuse	1
obeisances	1
and	1
ceremonies.	1
Then	1
came	1
twelve	1
pages,	1
together	1
with	1
the	1
seneschal,	1
to	1
lead	1
him	1
to	1
dinner,	1
as	1
his	1
hosts	1
were	1
already	1
waiting	1
for	1
him.	1
They	1
placed	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
them,	1
and	1
with	1
much	1
pomp	1
and	1
stateliness	1
they	1
conducted	1
him	1
into	1
another	1
room,	1
where	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
sumptuous	1
table	1
laid	1
with	1
but	1
four	1
covers.	1
The	1
duchess	1
and	1
the	1
duke	1
came	1
out	1
to	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
to	1
receive	1
him,	1
and	1
with	1
them	1
a	1
grave	1
ecclesiastic,	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
rule	1
noblemen’s	1
houses;	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
who,	1
not	1
being	1
born	1
magnates	1
themselves,	1
never	1
know	1
how	1
to	1
teach	1
those	1
who	1
are	1
how	1
to	1
behave	1
as	1
such;	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
would	1
have	1
the	1
greatness	1
of	1
great	1
folk	1
measured	1
by	1
their	1
own	1
narrowness	1
of	1
mind;	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
who,	1
when	1
they	1
try	1
to	1
introduce	1
economy	1
into	1
the	1
household	1
they	1
rule,	1
lead	1
it	1
into	1
meanness.	1
One	1
of	1
this	1
sort,	1
I	1
say,	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
the	1
grave	1
churchman	1
who	1
came	1
out	1
with	1
the	1
duke	1
and	1
duchess	1
to	1
receive	1
Don	1
Quixote.	1
A	1
vast	1
number	1
of	1
polite	1
speeches	1
were	1
exchanged,	1
and	1
at	1
length,	1
taking	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
between	1
them,	1
they	1
proceeded	1
to	1
sit	1
down	1
to	1
table.	1
The	1
duke	1
pressed	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
to	1
take	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
table,	1
and,	1
though	1
he	1
refused,	1
the	1
entreaties	1
of	1
the	1
duke	1
were	1
so	1
urgent	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
accept	1
it.	1
The	1
ecclesiastic	1
took	1
his	1
seat	1
opposite	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
the	1
duke	1
and	1
duchess	1
those	1
at	1
the	1
sides.	1
All	1
this	1
time	1
Sancho	1
stood	1
by,	1
gaping	1
with	1
amazement	1
at	1
the	1
honour	1
he	1
saw	1
shown	1
to	1
his	1
master	1
by	1
these	1
illustrious	1
persons;	1
and	1
observing	1
all	1
the	1
ceremonious	1
pressing	1
that	1
had	1
passed	1
between	1
the	1
duke	1
and	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
to	1
induce	1
him	1
to	1
take	1
his	1
seat	1
at	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
table,	1
he	1
said,	1
“If	1
your	1
worship	1
will	1
give	1
me	1
leave	1
I	1
will	1
tell	1
you	1
a	1
story	1
of	1
what	1
happened	1
in	1
my	1
village	1
about	1
this	1
matter	1
of	1
seats.”	1
The	1
moment	1
Sancho	1
said	1
this	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
trembled,	1
making	1
sure	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
say	1
something	1
foolish.	1
Sancho	1
glanced	1
at	1
him,	1
and	1
guessing	1
his	1
thoughts,	1
said,	1
“Don’t	1
be	1
afraid	1
of	1
my	1
going	1
astray,	1
señor,	1
or	1
saying	1
anything	1
that	1
won’t	1
be	1
pat	1
to	1
the	1
purpose;	1
I	1
haven’t	1
forgotten	1
the	1
advice	1
your	1
worship	1
gave	1
me	1
just	1
now	1
about	1
talking	1
much	1
or	1
little,	1
well	1
or	1
ill.”	1
“I	1
have	1
no	1
recollection	1
of	1
anything,	1
Sancho,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
“say	1
what	1
thou	1
wilt,	1
only	1
say	1
it	1
quickly.”	1
“Well	1
then,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“what	1
I	1
am	1
going	1
to	1
say	1
is	1
so	1
true	1
that	1
my	1
master	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
who	1
is	1
here	1
present,	1
will	1
keep	1
me	1
from	1
lying.”	1
“Lie	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
thou	1
wilt	1
for	1
all	1
I	1
care,	1
Sancho,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“for	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
going	1
to	1
stop	1
thee,	1
but	1
consider	1
what	1
thou	1
art	1
going	1
to	1
say.”	1
“I	1
have	1
so	1
considered	1
and	1
reconsidered,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“that	1
the	1
bell-ringer’s	1
in	1
a	1
safe	1
berth;	1
as	1
will	1
be	1
seen	1
by	1
what	1
follows.”	1
“It	1
would	1
be	1
well,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“if	1
your	1
highnesses	1
would	1
order	1
them	1
to	1
turn	1
out	1
this	1
idiot,	1
for	1
he	1
will	1
talk	1
a	1
heap	1
of	1
nonsense.”	1
“By	1
the	1
life	1
of	1
the	1
duke,	1
Sancho	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
taken	1
away	1
from	1
me	1
for	1
a	1
moment,”	1
said	1
the	1
duchess;	1
“I	1
am	1
very	1
fond	1
of	1
him,	1
for	1
I	1
know	1
he	1
is	1
very	1
discreet.”	1
“Discreet	1
be	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
your	1
holiness,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“for	1
the	1
good	1
opinion	1
you	1
have	1
of	1
my	1
wit,	1
though	1
there’s	1
none	1
in	1
me;	1
but	1
the	1
story	1
I	1
want	1
to	1
tell	1
is	1
this.	1
There	1
was	1
an	1
invitation	1
given	1
by	1
a	1
gentleman	1
of	1
my	1
town,	1
a	1
very	1
rich	1
one,	1
and	1
one	1
of	1
quality,	1
for	1
he	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
Alamos	1
of	1
Medina	1
del	1
Campo,	1
and	1
married	1
to	1
Doña	1
Mencia	1
de	1
Quiñones,	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
Don	1
Alonso	1
de	1
Marañon,	1
Knight	1
of	1
the	1
Order	1
of	1
Santiago,	1
that	1
was	1
drowned	1
at	1
the	1
Herradura—him	1
there	1
was	1
that	1
quarrel	1
about	1
years	1
ago	1
in	1
our	1
village,	1
that	1
my	1
master	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
was	1
mixed	1
up	1
in,	1
to	1
the	1
best	1
of	1
my	1
belief,	1
that	1
Tomasillo	1
the	1
scapegrace,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Balbastro	1
the	1
smith,	1
was	1
wounded	1
in.—Isn’t	1
all	1
this	1
true,	1
master	1
mine?	1
As	1
you	1
live,	1
say	1
so,	1
that	1
these	1
gentlefolk	1
may	1
not	1
take	1
me	1
for	1
some	1
lying	1
chatterer.”	1
“So	1
far,”	1
said	1
the	1
ecclesiastic,	1
“I	1
take	1
you	1
to	1
be	1
more	1
a	1
chatterer	1
than	1
a	1
liar;	1
but	1
I	1
don’t	1
know	1
what	1
I	1
shall	1
take	1
you	1
for	1
by-and-by.”	1
“Thou	1
citest	1
so	1
many	1
witnesses	1
and	1
proofs,	1
Sancho,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“that	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
choice	1
but	1
to	1
say	1
thou	1
must	1
be	1
telling	1
the	1
truth;	1
go	1
on,	1
and	1
cut	1
the	1
story	1
short,	1
for	1
thou	1
art	1
taking	1
the	1
way	1
not	1
to	1
make	1
an	1
end	1
for	1
two	1
days	1
to	1
come.”	1
“He	1
is	1
not	1
to	1
cut	1
it	1
short,”	1
said	1
the	1
duchess;	1
“on	1
the	1
contrary,	1
for	1
my	1
gratification,	1
he	1
is	1
to	1
tell	1
it	1
as	1
he	1
knows	1
it,	1
though	1
he	1
should	1
not	1
finish	1
it	1
these	1
six	1
days;	1
and	1
if	1
he	1
took	1
so	1
many	1
they	1
would	1
be	1
to	1
me	1
the	1
pleasantest	1
I	1
ever	1
spent.”	1
“Well	1
then,	1
sirs,	1
I	1
say,”	1
continued	1
Sancho,	1
“that	1
this	1
same	1
gentleman,	1
whom	1
I	1
know	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
I	1
do	1
my	1
own	1
hands,	1
for	1
it’s	1
not	1
a	1
bowshot	1
from	1
my	1
house	1
to	1
his,	1
invited	1
a	1
poor	1
but	1
respectable	1
labourer—”	1
“Get	1
on,	1
brother,”	1
said	1
the	1
churchman;	1
“at	1
the	1
rate	1
you	1
are	1
going	1
you	1
will	1
not	1
stop	1
with	1
your	1
story	1
short	1
of	1
the	1
next	1
world.”	1
“I’ll	1
stop	1
less	1
than	1
half-way,	1
please	1
God,”	1
said	1
Sancho;	1
“and	1
so	1
I	1
say	1
this	1
labourer,	1
coming	1
to	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
the	1
gentleman	1
I	1
spoke	1
of	1
that	1
invited	1
him—rest	1
his	1
soul,	1
he	1
is	1
now	1
dead;	1
and	1
more	1
by	1
token	1
he	1
died	1
the	1
death	1
of	1
an	1
angel,	1
so	1
they	1
say;	1
for	1
I	1
was	1
not	1
there,	1
for	1
just	1
at	1
that	1
time	1
I	1
had	1
gone	1
to	1
reap	1
at	1
Tembleque—”	1
“As	1
you	1
live,	1
my	1
son,”	1
said	1
the	1
churchman,	1
“make	1
haste	1
back	1
from	1
Tembleque,	1
and	1
finish	1
your	1
story	1
without	1
burying	1
the	1
gentleman,	1
unless	1
you	1
want	1
to	1
make	1
more	1
funerals.”	1
“Well	1
then,	1
it	1
so	1
happened,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“that	1
as	1
the	1
pair	1
of	1
them	1
were	1
going	1
to	1
sit	1
down	1
to	1
table—and	1
I	1
think	1
I	1
can	1
see	1
them	1
now	1
plainer	1
than	1
ever—”	1
Great	1
was	1
the	1
enjoyment	1
the	1
duke	1
and	1
duchess	1
derived	1
from	1
the	1
irritation	1
the	1
worthy	1
churchman	1
showed	1
at	1
the	1
long-winded,	1
halting	1
way	1
Sancho	1
had	1
of	1
telling	1
his	1
story,	1
while	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
was	1
chafing	1
with	1
rage	1
and	1
vexation.	1
“So,	1
as	1
I	1
was	1
saying,”	1
continued	1
Sancho,	1
“as	1
the	1
pair	1
of	1
them	1
were	1
going	1
to	1
sit	1
down	1
to	1
table,	1
as	1
I	1
said,	1
the	1
labourer	1
insisted	1
upon	1
the	1
gentleman’s	1
taking	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
table,	1
and	1
the	1
gentleman	1
insisted	1
upon	1
the	1
labourer’s	1
taking	1
it,	1
as	1
his	1
orders	1
should	1
be	1
obeyed	1
in	1
his	1
house;	1
but	1
the	1
labourer,	1
who	1
plumed	1
himself	1
on	1
his	1
politeness	1
and	1
good	1
breeding,	1
would	1
not	1
on	1
any	1
account,	1
until	1
the	1
gentleman,	1
out	1
of	1
patience,	1
putting	1
his	1
hands	1
on	1
his	1
shoulders,	1
compelled	1
him	1
by	1
force	1
to	1
sit	1
down,	1
saying,	1
‘Sit	1
down,	1
you	1
stupid	1
lout,	1
for	1
wherever	1
I	1
sit	1
will	1
be	1
the	1
head	1
to	1
you;	1
and	1
that’s	1
the	1
story,	1
and,	1
troth,	1
I	1
think	1
it	1
hasn’t	1
been	1
brought	1
in	1
amiss	1
here.”	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
turned	1
all	1
colours,	1
which,	1
on	1
his	1
sunburnt	1
face,	1
mottled	1
it	1
till	1
it	1
looked	1
like	1
jasper.	1
The	1
duke	1
and	1
duchess	1
suppressed	1
their	1
laughter	1
so	1
as	1
not	1
altogether	1
to	1
mortify	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
for	1
they	1
saw	1
through	1
Sancho’s	1
impertinence;	1
and	1
to	1
change	1
the	1
conversation,	1
and	1
keep	1
Sancho	1
from	1
uttering	1
more	1
absurdities,	1
the	1
duchess	1
asked	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
what	1
news	1
he	1
had	1
of	1
the	1
lady	1
Dulcinea,	1
and	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
sent	1
her	1
any	1
presents	1
of	1
giants	1
or	1
miscreants	1
lately,	1
for	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
but	1
have	1
vanquished	1
a	1
good	1
many.	1
To	1
which	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
replied,	1
“Señora,	1
my	1
misfortunes,	1
though	1
they	1
had	1
a	1
beginning,	1
will	1
never	1
have	1
an	1
end.	1
I	1
have	1
vanquished	1
giants	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
sent	1
her	1
caitiffs	1
and	1
miscreants;	1
but	1
where	1
are	1
they	1
to	1
find	1
her	1
if	1
she	1
is	1
enchanted	1
and	1
turned	1
into	1
the	1
most	1
ill-favoured	1
peasant	1
wench	1
that	1
can	1
be	1
imagined?”	1
“I	1
don’t	1
know,”	1
said	1
Sancho	1
Panza;	1
“to	1
me	1
she	1
seems	1
the	1
fairest	1
creature	1
in	1
the	1
world;	1
at	1
any	1
rate,	1
in	1
nimbleness	1
and	1
jumping	1
she	1
won’t	1
give	1
in	1
to	1
a	1
tumbler;	1
by	1
my	1
faith,	1
señora	1
duchess,	1
she	1
leaps	1
from	1
the	1
ground	1
on	1
to	1
the	1
back	1
of	1
an	1
ass	1
like	1
a	1
cat.”	1
“Have	1
you	1
seen	1
her	1
enchanted,	1
Sancho?”	1
asked	1
the	1
duke.	1
“What,	1
seen	1
her!”	1
said	1
Sancho;	1
“why,	1
who	1
the	1
devil	1
was	1
it	1
but	1
myself	1
that	1
first	1
thought	1
of	1
the	1
enchantment	1
business?	1
She	1
is	1
as	1
much	1
enchanted	1
as	1
my	1
father.”	1
The	1
ecclesiastic,	1
when	1
he	1
heard	1
them	1
talking	1
of	1
giants	1
and	1
caitiffs	1
and	1
enchantments,	1
began	1
to	1
suspect	1
that	1
this	1
must	1
be	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
of	1
La	1
Mancha,	1
whose	1
story	1
the	1
duke	1
was	1
always	1
reading;	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
himself	1
often	1
reproved	1
him	1
for	1
it,	1
telling	1
him	1
it	1
was	1
foolish	1
to	1
read	1
such	1
fooleries;	1
and	1
becoming	1
convinced	1
that	1
his	1
suspicion	1
was	1
correct,	1
addressing	1
the	1
duke,	1
he	1
said	1
very	1
angrily	1
to	1
him,	1
“Señor,	1
your	1
excellence	1
will	1
have	1
to	1
give	1
account	1
to	1
God	1
for	1
what	1
this	1
good	1
man	1
does.	1
This	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
or	1
Don	1
Simpleton,	1
or	1
whatever	1
his	1
name	1
is,	1
cannot,	1
I	1
imagine,	1
be	1
such	1
a	1
blockhead	1
as	1
your	1
excellence	1
would	1
have	1
him,	1
holding	1
out	1
encouragement	1
to	1
him	1
to	1
go	1
on	1
with	1
his	1
vagaries	1
and	1
follies.”	1
Then	1
turning	1
to	1
address	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
he	1
said,	1
“And	1
you,	1
num-skull,	1
who	1
put	1
it	1
into	1
your	1
head	1
that	1
you	1
are	1
a	1
knight-errant,	1
and	1
vanquish	1
giants	1
and	1
capture	1
miscreants?	1
Go	1
your	1
ways	1
in	1
a	1
good	1
hour,	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
good	1
hour	1
be	1
it	1
said	1
to	1
you.	1
Go	1
home	1
and	1
bring	1
up	1
your	1
children	1
if	1
you	1
have	1
any,	1
and	1
attend	1
to	1
your	1
business,	1
and	1
give	1
over	1
going	1
wandering	1
about	1
the	1
world,	1
gaping	1
and	1
making	1
a	1
laughing-stock	1
of	1
yourself	1
to	1
all	1
who	1
know	1
you	1
and	1
all	1
who	1
don’t.	1
Where,	1
in	1
heaven’s	1
name,	1
have	1
you	1
discovered	1
that	1
there	1
are	1
or	1
ever	1
were	1
knights-errant?	1
Where	1
are	1
there	1
giants	1
in	1
Spain	1
or	1
miscreants	1
in	1
La	1
Mancha,	1
or	1
enchanted	1
Dulcineas,	1
or	1
all	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
silly	1
things	1
they	1
tell	1
about	1
you?”	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
listened	1
attentively	1
to	1
the	1
reverend	1
gentleman’s	1
words,	1
and	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
perceived	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
speaking,	1
regardless	1

Don	1
Quixote,	1
then,	1
having	1
risen	1
to	1
his	1
feet,	1
trembling	1
from	1
head	1
to	1
foot	1
like	1
a	1
man	1
dosed	1
with	1
mercury,	1
said	1
in	1
a	1
hurried,	1
agitated	1
voice,	1
“The	1
place	1
I	1
am	1
in,	1
the	1
presence	1
in	1
which	1
I	1
stand,	1
and	1
the	1
respect	1
I	1
have	1
and	1
always	1
have	1
had	1
for	1
the	1
profession	1
to	1
which	1
your	1
worship	1
belongs,	1
hold	1
and	1
bind	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
my	1
just	1
indignation;	1
and	1
as	1
well	1
for	1
these	1
reasons	1
as	1
because	1
I	1
know,	1
as	1
everyone	1
knows,	1
that	1
a	1
gownsman’s	1
weapon	1
is	1
the	1
same	1
as	1
a	1
woman’s,	1
the	1
tongue,	1
I	1
will	1
with	1
mine	1
engage	1
in	1
equal	1
combat	1
with	1
your	1
worship,	1
from	1
whom	1
one	1
might	1
have	1
expected	1
good	1
advice	1
instead	1
of	1
foul	1
abuse.	1
Pious,	1
well-meant	1
reproof	1
requires	1
a	1
different	1
demeanour	1
and	1
arguments	1
of	1
another	1
sort;	1
at	1
any	1
rate,	1
to	1
have	1
reproved	1
me	1
in	1
public,	1
and	1
so	1
roughly,	1
exceeds	1
the	1
bounds	1
of	1
proper	1
reproof,	1
for	1
that	1
comes	1
better	1
with	1
gentleness	1
than	1
with	1
rudeness;	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
seemly	1
to	1
call	1
the	1
sinner	1
roundly	1
blockhead	1
and	1
booby,	1
without	1
knowing	1
anything	1
of	1
the	1
sin	1
that	1
is	1
reproved.	1
Come,	1
tell	1
me,	1
for	1
which	1
of	1
the	1
stupidities	1
you	1
have	1
observed	1
in	1
me	1
do	1
you	1
condemn	1
and	1
abuse	1
me,	1
and	1
bid	1
me	1
go	1
home	1
and	1
look	1
after	1
my	1
house	1
and	1
wife	1
and	1
children,	1
without	1
knowing	1
whether	1
I	1
have	1
any?	1
Is	1
nothing	1
more	1
needed	1
than	1
to	1
get	1
a	1
footing,	1
by	1
hook	1
or	1
by	1
crook,	1
in	1
other	1
people’s	1
houses	1
to	1
rule	1
over	1
the	1
masters	1
(and	1
that,	1
perhaps,	1
after	1
having	1
been	1
brought	1
up	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
straitness	1
of	1
some	1
seminary,	1
and	1
without	1
having	1
ever	1
seen	1
more	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
than	1
may	1
lie	1
within	1
twenty	1
or	1
thirty	1
leagues	1
round),	1
to	1
fit	1
one	1
to	1
lay	1
down	1
the	1
law	1
rashly	1
for	1
chivalry,	1
and	1
pass	1
judgment	1
on	1
knights-errant?	1
Is	1
it,	1
haply,	1
an	1
idle	1
occupation,	1
or	1
is	1
the	1
time	1
ill-spent	1
that	1
is	1
spent	1
in	1
roaming	1
the	1
world	1
in	1
quest,	1
not	1
of	1
its	1
enjoyments,	1
but	1
of	1
those	1
arduous	1
toils	1
whereby	1
the	1
good	1
mount	1
upwards	1
to	1
the	1
abodes	1
of	1
everlasting	1
life?	1
If	1
gentlemen,	1
great	1
lords,	1
nobles,	1
men	1
of	1
high	1
birth,	1
were	1
to	1
rate	1
me	1
as	1
a	1
fool	1
I	1
should	1
take	1
it	1
as	1
an	1
irreparable	1
insult;	1
but	1
I	1
care	1
not	1
a	1
farthing	1
if	1
clerks	1
who	1
have	1
never	1
entered	1
upon	1
or	1
trod	1
the	1
paths	1
of	1
chivalry	1
should	1
think	1
me	1
foolish.	1
Knight	1
I	1
am,	1
and	1
knight	1
I	1
will	1
die,	1
if	1
such	1
be	1
the	1
pleasure	1
of	1
the	1
Most	1
High.	1
Some	1
take	1
the	1
broad	1
road	1
of	1
overweening	1
ambition;	1
others	1
that	1
of	1
mean	1
and	1
servile	1
flattery;	1
others	1
that	1
of	1
deceitful	1
hypocrisy,	1
and	1
some	1
that	1
of	1
true	1
religion;	1
but	1
I,	1
led	1
by	1
my	1
star,	1
follow	1
the	1
narrow	1
path	1
of	1
knight-errantry,	1
and	1
in	1
pursuit	1
of	1
that	1
calling	1
I	1
despise	1
wealth,	1
but	1
not	1
honour.	1
I	1
have	1
redressed	1
injuries,	1
righted	1
wrongs,	1
punished	1
insolences,	1
vanquished	1
giants,	1
and	1
crushed	1
monsters;	1
I	1
am	1
in	1
love,	1
for	1
no	1
other	1
reason	1
than	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
incumbent	1
on	1
knights-errant	1
to	1
be	1
so;	1
but	1
though	1
I	1
am,	1
I	1
am	1
no	1
carnal-minded	1
lover,	1
but	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
chaste,	1
platonic	1
sort.	1
My	1
intentions	1
are	1
always	1
directed	1
to	1
worthy	1
ends,	1
to	1
do	1
good	1
to	1
all	1
and	1
evil	1
to	1
none;	1
and	1
if	1
he	1
who	1
means	1
this,	1
does	1
this,	1
and	1
makes	1
this	1
his	1
practice	1
deserves	1
to	1
be	1
called	1
a	1
fool,	1
it	1
is	1
for	1
your	1
highnesses	1
to	1
say,	1
O	1
most	1
excellent	1
duke	1
and	1
duchess.”	1
“Good,	1
by	1
God!”	1
cried	1
Sancho;	1
“say	1
no	1
more	1
in	1
your	1
own	1
defence,	1
master	1
mine,	1
for	1
there’s	1
nothing	1
more	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
to	1
be	1
said,	1
thought,	1
or	1
insisted	1
on;	1
and	1
besides,	1
when	1
this	1
gentleman	1
denies,	1
as	1
he	1
has,	1
that	1
there	1
are	1
or	1
ever	1
have	1
been	1
any	1
knights-errant	1
in	1
the	1
world,	1
is	1
it	1
any	1
wonder	1
if	1
he	1
knows	1
nothing	1
of	1
what	1
he	1
has	1
been	1
talking	1
about?”	1
“Perhaps,	1
brother,”	1
said	1
the	1
ecclesiastic,	1
“you	1
are	1
that	1
Sancho	1
Panza	1
that	1
is	1
mentioned,	1
to	1
whom	1
your	1
master	1
has	1
promised	1
an	1
island?”	1
“Yes,	1
I	1
am,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“and	1
what’s	1
more,	1
I	1
am	1
one	1
who	1
deserves	1
it	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
anyone;	1
I	1
am	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
sort—‘Attach	1
thyself	1
to	1
the	1
good,	1
and	1
thou	1
wilt	1
be	1
one	1
of	1
them,’	1
and	1
of	1
those,	1
‘Not	1
with	1
whom	1
thou	1
art	1
bred,	1
but	1
with	1
whom	1
thou	1
art	1
fed,’	1
and	1
of	1
those,	1
‘Who	1
leans	1
against	1
a	1
good	1
tree,	1
a	1
good	1
shade	1
covers	1
him;’	1
I	1
have	1
leant	1
upon	1
a	1
good	1
master,	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
for	1
months	1
going	1
about	1
with	1
him,	1
and	1
please	1
God	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
just	1
such	1
another;	1
long	1
life	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
long	1
life	1
to	1
me,	1
for	1
neither	1
will	1
he	1
be	1
in	1
any	1
want	1
of	1
empires	1
to	1
rule,	1
or	1
I	1
of	1
islands	1
to	1
govern.”	1
“No,	1
Sancho	1
my	1
friend,	1
certainly	1
not,”	1
said	1
the	1
duke,	1
“for	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Señor	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
I	1
confer	1
upon	1
you	1
the	1
government	1
of	1
one	1
of	1
no	1
small	1
importance	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
at	1
my	1
disposal.”	1
“Go	1
down	1
on	1
thy	1
knees,	1
Sancho,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“and	1
kiss	1
the	1
feet	1
of	1
his	1
excellence	1
for	1
the	1
favour	1
he	1
has	1
bestowed	1
upon	1
thee.”	1
Sancho	1
obeyed,	1
and	1
on	1
seeing	1
this	1
the	1
ecclesiastic	1
stood	1
up	1
from	1
table	1
completely	1
out	1
of	1
temper,	1
exclaiming,	1
“By	1
the	1
gown	1
I	1
wear,	1
I	1
am	1
almost	1
inclined	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
your	1
excellence	1
is	1
as	1
great	1
a	1
fool	1
as	1
these	1
sinners.	1
No	1
wonder	1
they	1
are	1
mad,	1
when	1
people	1
who	1
are	1
in	1
their	1
senses	1
sanction	1
their	1
madness!	1
I	1
leave	1
your	1
excellence	1
with	1
them,	1
for	1
so	1
long	1
as	1
they	1
are	1
in	1
the	1
house,	1
I	1
will	1
remain	1
in	1
my	1
own,	1
and	1
spare	1
myself	1
the	1
trouble	1
of	1
reproving	1
what	1
I	1
cannot	1
remedy;”	1
and	1
without	1
uttering	1
another	1
word,	1
or	1
eating	1
another	1
morsel,	1
he	1
went	1
off,	1
the	1
entreaties	1
of	1
the	1
duke	1
and	1
duchess	1
being	1
entirely	1
unavailing	1
to	1
stop	1
him;	1
not	1
that	1
the	1
duke	1
said	1
much	1
to	1
him,	1
for	1
he	1
could	1
not,	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
laughter	1
his	1
uncalled-for	1
anger	1
provoked.	1
When	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
laughing,	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“You	1
have	1
replied	1
on	1
your	1
own	1
behalf	1
so	1
stoutly,	1
Sir	1
Knight	1
of	1
the	1
Lions,	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
occasion	1
to	1
seek	1
further	1
satisfaction	1
for	1
this,	1
which,	1
though	1
it	1
may	1
look	1
like	1
an	1
offence,	1
is	1
not	1
so	1
at	1
all,	1
for,	1
as	1
women	1
can	1
give	1
no	1
offence,	1
no	1
more	1
can	1
ecclesiastics,	1
as	1
you	1
very	1
well	1
know.”	1
“That	1
is	1
true,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“and	1
the	1
reason	1
is,	1
that	1
he	1
who	1
is	1
not	1
liable	1
to	1
offence	1
cannot	1
give	1
offence	1
to	1
anyone.	1
Women,	1
children,	1
and	1
ecclesiastics,	1
as	1
they	1
cannot	1
defend	1
themselves,	1
though	1
they	1
may	1
receive	1
offence	1
cannot	1
be	1
insulted,	1
because	1
between	1
the	1
offence	1
and	1
the	1
insult	1
there	1
is,	1
as	1
your	1
excellence	1
very	1
well	1
knows,	1
this	1
difference:	1
the	1
insult	1
comes	1
from	1
one	1
who	1
is	1
capable	1
of	1
offering	1
it,	1
and	1
does	1
so,	1
and	1
maintains	1
it;	1
the	1
offence	1
may	1
come	1
from	1
any	1
quarter	1
without	1
carrying	1
insult.	1
To	1
take	1
an	1
example:	1
a	1
man	1
is	1
standing	1
unsuspectingly	1
in	1
the	1
street	1
and	1
ten	1
others	1
come	1
up	1
armed	1
and	1
beat	1
him;	1
he	1
draws	1
his	1
sword	1
and	1
quits	1
himself	1
like	1
a	1
man,	1
but	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
his	1
antagonists	1
makes	1
it	1
impossible	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
effect	1
his	1
purpose	1
and	1
avenge	1
himself;	1
this	1
man	1
suffers	1
an	1
offence	1
but	1
not	1
an	1
insult.	1
Another	1
example	1
will	1
make	1
the	1
same	1
thing	1
plain:	1
a	1
man	1
is	1
standing	1
with	1
his	1
back	1
turned,	1
another	1
comes	1
up	1
and	1
strikes	1
him,	1
and	1
after	1
striking	1
him	1
takes	1
to	1
flight,	1
without	1
waiting	1
an	1
instant,	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
pursues	1
him	1
but	1
does	1
not	1
overtake	1
him;	1
he	1
who	1
received	1
the	1
blow	1
received	1
an	1
offence,	1
but	1
not	1
an	1
insult,	1
because	1
an	1
insult	1
must	1
be	1
maintained.	1
If	1
he	1
who	1
struck	1
him,	1
though	1
he	1
did	1
so	1
sneakingly	1
and	1
treacherously,	1
had	1
drawn	1
his	1
sword	1
and	1
stood	1
and	1
faced	1
him,	1
then	1
he	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
struck	1
would	1
have	1
received	1
offence	1
and	1
insult	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time;	1
offence	1
because	1
he	1
was	1
struck	1
treacherously,	1
insult	1
because	1
he	1
who	1
struck	1
him	1
maintained	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
done,	1
standing	1
his	1
ground	1
without	1
taking	1
to	1
flight.	1
And	1
so,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
laws	1
of	1
the	1
accursed	1
duel,	1
I	1
may	1
have	1
received	1
offence,	1
but	1
not	1
insult,	1
for	1
neither	1
women	1
nor	1
children	1
can	1
maintain	1
it,	1
nor	1
can	1
they	1
wound,	1
nor	1
have	1
they	1
any	1
way	1
of	1
standing	1
their	1
ground,	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
just	1
the	1
same	1
with	1
those	1
connected	1
with	1
religion;	1
for	1
these	1
three	1
sorts	1
of	1
persons	1
are	1
without	1
arms	1
offensive	1
or	1
defensive,	1
and	1
so,	1
though	1
naturally	1
they	1
are	1
bound	1
to	1
defend	1
themselves,	1
they	1
have	1
no	1
right	1
to	1
offend	1
anybody;	1
and	1
though	1
I	1
said	1
just	1
now	1
I	1
might	1
have	1
received	1
offence,	1
I	1
say	1
now	1
certainly	1
not,	1
for	1
he	1
who	1
cannot	1
receive	1
an	1
insult	1
can	1
still	1
less	1
give	1
one;	1
for	1
which	1
reasons	1
I	1
ought	1
not	1
to	1
feel,	1
nor	1
do	1
I	1
feel,	1
aggrieved	1
at	1
what	1
that	1
good	1
man	1
said	1
to	1
me;	1
I	1
only	1
wish	1
he	1
had	1
stayed	1
a	1
little	1
longer,	1
that	1
I	1
might	1
have	1
shown	1
him	1
the	1
mistake	1
he	1
makes	1
in	1
supposing	1
and	1
maintaining	1
that	1
there	1
are	1
not	1
and	1
never	1
have	1
been	1
any	1
knights-errant	1
in	1
the	1
world;	1
had	1
Amadis	1
or	1
any	1
of	1
his	1
countless	1
descendants	1
heard	1
him	1
say	1
as	1
much,	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
it	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
gone	1
well	1
with	1
his	1
worship.”	1
“I	1
will	1
take	1
my	1
oath	1
of	1
that,”	1
said	1
Sancho;	1
“they	1
would	1
have	1
given	1
him	1
a	1
slash	1
that	1
would	1
have	1
slit	1
him	1
down	1
from	1
top	1
to	1
toe	1
like	1
a	1
pomegranate	1
or	1
a	1
ripe	1
melon;	1
they	1
were	1
likely	1
fellows	1
to	1
put	1
up	1
with	1
jokes	1
of	1
that	1
sort!	1
By	1
my	1
faith,	1
I’m	1
certain	1
if	1
Reinaldos	1
of	1
Montalvan	1
had	1
heard	1
the	1
little	1
man’s	1
words	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
given	1
him	1
such	1
a	1
spank	1
on	1
the	1
mouth	1
that	1
he	1
wouldn’t	1
have	1
spoken	1
for	1
the	1
next	1
three	1
years;	1
ay,	1
let	1
him	1
tackle	1
them,	1
and	1
he’ll	1
see	1
how	1
he’ll	1
get	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
hands!”	1
The	1
duchess,	1
as	1
she	1
listened	1
to	1
Sancho,	1
was	1
ready	1
to	1
die	1
with	1
laughter,	1
and	1
in	1
her	1
own	1
mind	1
she	1
set	1
him	1
down	1
as	1
droller	1
and	1
madder	1
than	1
his	1
master;	1
and	1
there	1
were	1
a	1
good	1
many	1
just	1
then	1
who	1
were	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
opinion.	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
finally	1
grew	1
calm,	1
and	1
dinner	1
came	1
to	1
an	1
end,	1
and	1
as	1
the	1
cloth	1
was	1
removed	1
four	1
damsels	1
came	1
in,	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
with	1
a	1
silver	1
basin,	1
another	1
with	1
a	1
jug	1
also	1
of	1
silver,	1
a	1
third	1
with	1
two	1
fine	1
white	1
towels	1
on	1
her	1
shoulder,	1
and	1
the	1
fourth	1
with	1
her	1
arms	1
bared	1
to	1
the	1
elbows,	1
and	1
in	1
her	1
white	1
hands	1
(for	1
white	1
they	1
certainly	1
were)	1
a	1
round	1
ball	1
of	1
Naples	1
soap.	1
The	1
one	1
with	1
the	1
basin	1
approached,	1
and	1
with	1
arch	1
composure	1
and	1
impudence,	1
thrust	1
it	1
under	1
Don	1
Quixote’s	1
chin,	1
who,	1
wondering	1
at	1
such	1
a	1
ceremony,	1
said	1
never	1
a	1
word,	1
supposing	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
custom	1
of	1
that	1
country	1
to	1
wash	1
beards	1
instead	1
of	1
hands;	1
he	1
therefore	1
stretched	1
his	1
out	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
he	1
could,	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
instant	1
the	1
jug	1
began	1
to	1
pour	1
and	1
the	1
damsel	1
with	1
the	1
soap	1
rubbed	1
his	1
beard	1
briskly,	1
raising	1
snow-flakes,	1
for	1
the	1
soap	1
lather	1
was	1
no	1
less	1
white,	1
not	1
only	1
over	1
the	1
beard,	1
but	1
all	1
over	1
the	1
face,	1
and	1
over	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
the	1
submissive	1
knight,	1
so	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
perforce	1
obliged	1
to	1
keep	1
shut.	1
The	1
duke	1
and	1
duchess,	1
who	1
had	1
not	1
known	1
anything	1
about	1
this,	1
waited	1
to	1
see	1
what	1
came	1
of	1
this	1
strange	1
washing.	1
The	1
barber	1
damsel,	1
when	1
she	1
had	1
him	1
a	1
hand’s	1
breadth	1
deep	1
in	1
lather,	1
pretended	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
more	1
water,	1
and	1
bade	1
the	1
one	1
with	1
the	1
jug	1
go	1
and	1
fetch	1
some,	1
while	1
Señor	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
waited.	1
She	1
did	1
so,	1
and	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
was	1
left	1
the	1
strangest	1
and	1
most	1
ludicrous	1
figure	1
that	1
could	1
be	1
imagined.	1
All	1
those	1
present,	1
and	1
there	1
were	1
a	1
good	1
many,	1
were	1
watching	1
him,	1
and	1
as	1
they	1
saw	1
him	1
there	1
with	1
half	1
a	1
yard	1
of	1
neck,	1
and	1
that	1
uncommonly	1
brown,	1
his	1
eyes	1
shut,	1
and	1
his	1
beard	1
full	1
of	1
soap,	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
great	1
wonder,	1
and	1
only	1
by	1
great	1
discretion,	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
able	1
to	1
restrain	1
their	1
laughter.	1
The	1
damsels,	1
the	1
concocters	1
of	1
the	1
joke,	1
kept	1
their	1
eyes	1
down,	1
not	1
daring	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
their	1
master	1
and	1
mistress;	1
and	1
as	1
for	1
them,	1
laughter	1
and	1
anger	1
struggled	1
within	1
them,	1
and	1
they	1
knew	1
not	1
what	1
to	1
do,	1
whether	1
to	1
punish	1
the	1
audacity	1
of	1
the	1
girls,	1
or	1
to	1
reward	1
them	1
for	1
the	1
amusement	1
they	1
had	1
received	1
from	1
seeing	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
plight.	1
At	1
length	1
the	1
damsel	1
with	1
the	1
jug	1
returned	1
and	1
they	1
made	1
an	1
end	1
of	1
washing	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
and	1
the	1
one	1
who	1
carried	1
the	1
towels	1
very	1
deliberately	1
wiped	1
him	1
and	1
dried	1
him;	1
and	1
all	1
four	1
together	1
making	1
him	1
a	1
profound	1
obeisance	1
and	1
curtsey,	1
they	1
were	1
about	1
to	1
go,	1
when	1
the	1
duke,	1
lest	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
should	1
see	1
through	1
the	1
joke,	1
called	1
out	1
to	1
the	1
one	1
with	1
the	1
basin	1
saying,	1
“Come	1
and	1
wash	1
me,	1
and	1
take	1
care	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
water	1
enough.”	1
The	1
girl,	1
sharp-witted	1
and	1
prompt,	1
came	1
and	1
placed	1
the	1
basin	1
for	1
the	1
duke	1
as	1
she	1
had	1
done	1
for	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
and	1
they	1
soon	1
had	1
him	1
well	1
soaped	1
and	1
washed,	1
and	1
having	1
wiped	1
him	1
dry	1
they	1
made	1
their	1
obeisance	1
and	1
retired.	1
It	1
appeared	1
afterwards	1
that	1
the	1
duke	1
had	1
sworn	1
that	1
if	1
they	1
had	1
not	1
washed	1
him	1
as	1
they	1
had	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
punished	1
them	1
for	1
their	1
impudence,	1
which	1
they	1
adroitly	1
atoned	1
for	1
by	1
soaping	1
him	1
as	1
well.	1
Sancho	1
observed	1
the	1
ceremony	1
of	1
the	1
washing	1
very	1
attentively,	1
and	1
said	1
to	1
himself,	1
“God	1
bless	1
me,	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
only	1
the	1
custom	1
in	1
this	1
country	1
to	1
wash	1
squires’	1
beards	1
too	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
knights’.	1
For	1
by	1
God	1
and	1
upon	1
my	1
soul	1
I	1
want	1
it	1
badly;	1
and	1
if	1
they	1
gave	1
me	1
a	1
scrape	1
of	1
the	1
razor	1
besides	1
I’d	1
take	1
it	1
as	1
a	1
still	1
greater	1
kindness.”	1
“What	1
are	1
you	1
saying	1
to	1
yourself,	1
Sancho?”	1
asked	1
the	1
duchess.	1
“I	1
was	1
saying,	1
señora,”	1
he	1
replied,	1
“that	1
in	1
the	1
courts	1
of	1
other	1
princes,	1
when	1
the	1
cloth	1
is	1
taken	1
away,	1
I	1
have	1
always	1
heard	1
say	1
they	1
give	1
water	1
for	1
the	1
hands,	1
but	1
not	1
lye	1
for	1
the	1
beard;	1
and	1
that	1
shows	1
it	1
is	1
good	1
to	1
live	1
long	1
that	1
you	1
may	1
see	1
much;	1
to	1
be	1
sure,	1
they	1
say	1
too	1
that	1
he	1
who	1
lives	1
a	1
long	1
life	1
must	1
undergo	1
much	1
evil,	1
though	1
to	1
undergo	1
a	1
washing	1
of	1
that	1
sort	1
is	1
pleasure	1
rather	1
than	1
pain.”	1
“Don’t	1
be	1
uneasy,	1
friend	1
Sancho,”	1
said	1
the	1
duchess;	1
“I	1
will	1
take	1
care	1
that	1
my	1
damsels	1
wash	1
you,	1
and	1
even	1
put	1
you	1
in	1
the	1
tub	1
if	1
necessary.”	1
“I’ll	1
be	1
content	1
with	1
the	1
beard,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“at	1
any	1
rate	1
for	1
the	1
present;	1
and	1
as	1
for	1
the	1
future,	1
God	1
has	1
decreed	1
what	1
is	1
to	1
be.”	1
“Attend	1
to	1
worthy	1
Sancho’s	1
request,	1
seneschal,”	1
said	1
the	1
duchess,	1
“and	1
do	1
exactly	1
what	1
he	1
wishes.”	1
The	1
seneschal	1
replied	1
that	1
Señor	1
Sancho	1
should	1
be	1
obeyed	1
in	1
everything;	1
and	1
with	1
that	1
he	1
went	1
away	1
to	1
dinner	1
and	1
took	1
Sancho	1
along	1
with	1
him,	1
while	1
the	1
duke	1
and	1
duchess	1
and	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
remained	1
at	1
table	1
discussing	1
a	1
great	1
variety	1
of	1
things,	1
but	1
all	1
bearing	1
on	1
the	1
calling	1
of	1
arms	1
and	1
knight-errantry.	1
The	1
duchess	1
begged	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
as	1
he	1
seemed	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
retentive	1
memory,	1
to	1
describe	1
and	1
portray	1
to	1
her	1
the	1
beauty	1
and	1
features	1
of	1
the	1
lady	1
Dulcinea	1
del	1
Toboso,	1
for,	1
judging	1
by	1
what	1
fame	1
trumpeted	1
abroad	1
of	1
her	1
beauty,	1
she	1
felt	1
sure	1
she	1
must	1
be	1
the	1
fairest	1
creature	1
in	1
the	1
world,	1
nay,	1
in	1
all	1
La	1
Mancha.	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
sighed	1
on	1
hearing	1
the	1
duchess’s	1
request,	1
and	1
said,	1
“If	1
I	1
could	1
pluck	1
out	1
my	1
heart,	1
and	1
lay	1
it	1
on	1
a	1
plate	1
on	1
this	1
table	1
here	1
before	1
your	1
highness’s	1
eyes,	1
it	1
would	1
spare	1
my	1
tongue	1
the	1
pain	1
of	1
telling	1
what	1
can	1
hardly	1
be	1
thought	1
of,	1
for	1
in	1
it	1
your	1
excellence	1
would	1
see	1
her	1
portrayed	1
in	1
full.	1
But	1
why	1
should	1
I	1
attempt	1
to	1
depict	1
and	1
describe	1
in	1
detail,	1
and	1
feature	1
by	1
feature,	1
the	1
beauty	1
of	1
the	1
peerless	1
Dulcinea,	1
the	1
burden	1
being	1
one	1
worthy	1
of	1
other	1
shoulders	1
than	1
mine,	1
an	1
enterprise	1
wherein	1
the	1
pencils	1
of	1
Parrhasius,	1
Timantes,	1
and	1
Apelles,	1
and	1
the	1
graver	1
of	1
Lysippus	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
employed,	1
to	1
paint	1
it	1
in	1
pictures	1
and	1
carve	1
it	1
in	1
marble	1
and	1
bronze,	1
and	1
Ciceronian	1
and	1
Demosthenian	1
eloquence	1
to	1
sound	1
its	1
praises?”	1
“What	1
does	1
Demosthenian	1
mean,	1
Señor	1
Don	1
Quixote?”	1
said	1
the	1
duchess;	1
“it	1
is	1
a	1
word	1
I	1
never	1
heard	1
in	1
all	1
my	1
life.”	1
“Demosthenian	1
eloquence,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“means	1
the	1
eloquence	1
of	1
Demosthenes,	1
as	1
Ciceronian	1
means	1
that	1
of	1
Cicero,	1
who	1
were	1
the	1
two	1
most	1
eloquent	1
orators	1
in	1
the	1
world.”	1
“True,”	1
said	1
the	1
duke;	1
“you	1
must	1
have	1
lost	1
your	1
wits	1
to	1
ask	1
such	1
a	1
question.	1
Nevertheless,	1
Señor	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
would	1
greatly	1
gratify	1
us	1
if	1
he	1
would	1
depict	1
her	1
to	1
us;	1
for	1
never	1
fear,	1
even	1
in	1
an	1
outline	1
or	1
sketch	1
she	1
will	1
be	1
something	1
to	1
make	1
the	1
fairest	1
envious.”	1
“I	1
would	1
do	1
so	1
certainly,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“had	1
she	1
not	1
been	1
blurred	1
to	1
my	1
mind’s	1
eye	1
by	1
the	1
misfortune	1
that	1
fell	1
upon	1
her	1
a	1
short	1
time	1
since,	1
one	1
of	1
such	1
a	1
nature	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
more	1
ready	1
to	1
weep	1
over	1
it	1
than	1
to	1
describe	1
it.	1
For	1
your	1
highnesses	1
must	1
know	1
that,	1
going	1
a	1
few	1
days	1
back	1
to	1
kiss	1
her	1
hands	1
and	1
receive	1
her	1
benediction,	1
approbation,	1
and	1
permission	1
for	1
this	1
third	1
sally,	1
I	1
found	1
her	1
altogether	1
a	1
different	1
being	1
from	1
the	1
one	1
I	1
sought;	1
I	1
found	1
her	1
enchanted	1
and	1
changed	1
from	1
a	1
princess	1
into	1
a	1
peasant,	1
from	1
fair	1
to	1
foul,	1
from	1
an	1
angel	1
into	1
a	1
devil,	1
from	1
fragrant	1
to	1
pestiferous,	1
from	1
refined	1
to	1
clownish,	1
from	1
a	1
dignified	1
lady	1
into	1
a	1
jumping	1
tomboy,	1
and,	1
in	1
a	1
word,	1
from	1
Dulcinea	1
del	1
Toboso	1
into	1
a	1
coarse	1
Sayago	1
wench.”	1
“God	1
bless	1
me!”	1
said	1
the	1
duke	1
aloud	1
at	1
this,	1
“who	1
can	1
have	1
done	1
the	1
world	1
such	1
an	1
injury?	1
Who	1
can	1
have	1
robbed	1
it	1
of	1
the	1
beauty	1
that	1
gladdened	1
it,	1
of	1
the	1
grace	1
and	1
gaiety	1
that	1
charmed	1
it,	1
of	1
the	1
modesty	1
that	1
shed	1
a	1
lustre	1
upon	1
it?”	1
“Who?”	1
replied	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
“who	1
could	1
it	1
be	1
but	1
some	1
malignant	1
enchanter	1
of	1
the	1
many	1
that	1
persecute	1
me	1
out	1
of	1
envy—that	1
accursed	1
race	1
born	1
into	1
the	1
world	1
to	1
obscure	1
and	1
bring	1
to	1
naught	1
the	1
achievements	1
of	1
the	1
good,	1
and	1
glorify	1
and	1
exalt	1
the	1
deeds	1
of	1
the	1
wicked?	1
Enchanters	1
have	1
persecuted	1
me,	1
enchanters	1
persecute	1
me	1
still,	1
and	1
enchanters	1
will	1
continue	1
to	1
persecute	1
me	1
until	1
they	1
have	1
sunk	1
me	1
and	1
my	1
lofty	1
chivalry	1
in	1
the	1
deep	1
abyss	1
of	1
oblivion;	1
and	1
they	1
injure	1
and	1
wound	1
me	1
where	1
they	1
know	1
I	1
feel	1
it	1
most.	1
For	1
to	1
deprive	1
a	1
knight-errant	1
of	1
his	1
lady	1
is	1
to	1
deprive	1
him	1
of	1
the	1
eyes	1
he	1
sees	1
with,	1
of	1
the	1
sun	1
that	1
gives	1
him	1
light,	1
of	1
the	1
food	1
whereby	1
he	1
lives.	1
Many	1
a	1
time	1
before	1
have	1
I	1
said	1
it,	1
and	1
I	1
say	1
it	1
now	1
once	1
more,	1
a	1
knight-errant	1
without	1
a	1
lady	1
is	1
like	1
a	1
tree	1
without	1
leaves,	1
a	1
building	1
without	1
a	1
foundation,	1
or	1
a	1
shadow	1
without	1
the	1
body	1
that	1
causes	1
it.”	1
“There	1
is	1
no	1
denying	1
it,”	1
said	1
the	1
duchess;	1
“but	1
still,	1
if	1
we	1
are	1
to	1
believe	1
the	1
history	1
of	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
that	1
has	1
come	1
out	1
here	1
lately	1
with	1
general	1
applause,	1
it	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
inferred	1
from	1
it,	1
if	1
I	1
mistake	1
not,	1
that	1
you	1
never	1
saw	1
the	1
lady	1
Dulcinea,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
said	1
lady	1
is	1
nothing	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
but	1
an	1
imaginary	1
lady,	1
one	1
that	1
you	1
yourself	1
begot	1
and	1
gave	1
birth	1
to	1
in	1
your	1
brain,	1
and	1
adorned	1
with	1
whatever	1
charms	1
and	1
perfections	1
you	1
chose.”	1
“There	1
is	1
a	1
good	1
deal	1
to	1
be	1
said	1
on	1
that	1
point,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
“God	1
knows	1
whether	1
there	1
be	1
any	1
Dulcinea	1
or	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
world,	1
or	1
whether	1
she	1
is	1
imaginary	1
or	1
not	1
imaginary;	1
these	1
are	1
things	1
the	1
proof	1
of	1
which	1
must	1
not	1
be	1
pushed	1
to	1
extreme	1
lengths.	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
begotten	1
nor	1
given	1
birth	1
to	1
my	1
lady,	1
though	1
I	1
behold	1
her	1
as	1
she	1
needs	1
must	1
be,	1
a	1
lady	1
who	1
contains	1
in	1
herself	1
all	1
the	1
qualities	1
to	1
make	1
her	1
famous	1
throughout	1
the	1
world,	1
beautiful	1
without	1
blemish,	1
dignified	1
without	1
haughtiness,	1
tender	1
and	1
yet	1
modest,	1
gracious	1
from	1
courtesy	1
and	1
courteous	1
from	1
good	1
breeding,	1
and	1
lastly,	1
of	1
exalted	1
lineage,	1
because	1
beauty	1
shines	1
forth	1
and	1
excels	1
with	1
a	1
higher	1
degree	1
of	1
perfection	1
upon	1
good	1
blood	1
than	1
in	1
the	1
fair	1
of	1
lowly	1
birth.”	1
“That	1
is	1
true,”	1
said	1
the	1
duke;	1
“but	1
Señor	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
will	1
give	1
me	1
leave	1
to	1
say	1
what	1
I	1
am	1
constrained	1
to	1
say	1
by	1
the	1
story	1
of	1
his	1
exploits	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
read,	1
from	1
which	1
it	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
inferred	1
that,	1
granting	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
Dulcinea	1
in	1
El	1
Toboso,	1
or	1
out	1
of	1
it,	1
and	1
that	1
she	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
highest	1
degree	1
beautiful	1
as	1
you	1
have	1
described	1
her	1
to	1
us,	1
as	1
regards	1
the	1
loftiness	1
of	1
her	1
lineage	1
she	1
is	1
not	1
on	1
a	1
par	1
with	1
the	1
Orianas,	1
Alastrajareas,	1
Madasimas,	1
or	1
others	1
of	1
that	1
sort,	1
with	1
whom,	1
as	1
you	1
well	1
know,	1
the	1
histories	1
abound.”	1
“To	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
reply,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“that	1
Dulcinea	1
is	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
her	1
own	1
works,	1
and	1
that	1
virtues	1
rectify	1
blood,	1
and	1
that	1
lowly	1
virtue	1
is	1
more	1
to	1
be	1
regarded	1
and	1
esteemed	1
than	1
exalted	1
vice.	1
Dulcinea,	1
besides,	1
has	1
that	1
within	1
her	1
that	1
may	1
raise	1
her	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
crowned	1
and	1
sceptred	1
queen;	1
for	1
the	1
merit	1
of	1
a	1
fair	1
and	1
virtuous	1
woman	1
is	1
capable	1
of	1
performing	1
greater	1
miracles;	1
and	1
virtually,	1
though	1
not	1
formally,	1
she	1
has	1
in	1
herself	1
higher	1
fortunes.”	1
“I	1
protest,	1
Señor	1
Don	1
Quixote,”	1
said	1
the	1
duchess,	1
“that	1
in	1
all	1
you	1
say,	1
you	1
go	1
most	1
cautiously	1
and	1
lead	1
in	1
hand,	1
as	1
the	1
saying	1
is;	1
henceforth	1
I	1
will	1
believe	1
myself,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
take	1
care	1
that	1
everyone	1
in	1
my	1
house	1
believes,	1
even	1
my	1
lord	1
the	1
duke	1
if	1
needs	1
be,	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
Dulcinea	1
in	1
El	1
Toboso,	1
and	1
that	1
she	1
is	1
living	1
to-day,	1
and	1
that	1
she	1
is	1
beautiful	1
and	1
nobly	1
born	1
and	1
deserves	1
to	1
have	1
such	1
a	1
knight	1
as	1
Señor	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
in	1
her	1
service,	1
and	1
that	1
is	1
the	1
highest	1
praise	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
in	1
my	1
power	1
to	1
give	1
her	1
or	1
that	1
I	1
can	1
think	1
of.	1
But	1
I	1
cannot	1
help	1
entertaining	1
a	1
doubt,	1
and	1
having	1
a	1
certain	1
grudge	1
against	1
Sancho	1
Panza;	1
the	1
doubt	1
is	1
this,	1
that	1
the	1
aforesaid	1
history	1
declares	1
that	1
the	1
said	1
Sancho	1
Panza,	1
when	1
he	1
carried	1
a	1
letter	1
on	1
your	1
worship’s	1
behalf	1
to	1
the	1
said	1
lady	1
Dulcinea,	1
found	1
her	1
sifting	1
a	1
sack	1
of	1
wheat;	1
and	1
more	1
by	1
token	1
it	1
says	1
it	1
was	1
red	1
wheat;	1
a	1
thing	1
which	1
makes	1
me	1
doubt	1
the	1
loftiness	1
of	1
her	1
lineage.”	1
To	1
this	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
made	1
answer,	1
“Señora,	1
your	1
highness	1
must	1
know	1
that	1
everything	1
or	1
almost	1
everything	1
that	1
happens	1
me	1
transcends	1
the	1
ordinary	1
limits	1
of	1
what	1
happens	1
to	1
other	1
knights-errant;	1
whether	1
it	1
be	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
directed	1
by	1
the	1
inscrutable	1
will	1
of	1
destiny,	1
or	1
by	1
the	1
malice	1
of	1
some	1
jealous	1
enchanter.	1
Now	1
it	1
is	1
an	1
established	1
fact	1
that	1
all	1
or	1
most	1
famous	1
knights-errant	1
have	1
some	1
special	1
gift,	1
one	1
that	1
of	1
being	1
proof	1
against	1
enchantment,	1
another	1
that	1
of	1
being	1
made	1
of	1
such	1
invulnerable	1
flesh	1
that	1
he	1
cannot	1
be	1
wounded,	1
as	1
was	1
the	1
famous	1
Roland,	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
twelve	1
peers	1
of	1
France,	1
of	1
whom	1
it	1
is	1
related	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
wounded	1
except	1
in	1
the	1
sole	1
of	1
his	1
left	1
foot,	1
and	1
that	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
with	1
the	1
point	1
of	1
a	1
stout	1
pin	1
and	1
not	1
with	1
any	1
other	1
sort	1
of	1
weapon	1
whatever;	1
and	1
so,	1
when	1
Bernardo	1
del	1
Carpio	1
slew	1
him	1
at	1
Roncesvalles,	1
finding	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
wound	1
him	1
with	1
steel,	1
he	1
lifted	1
him	1
up	1
from	1
the	1
ground	1
in	1
his	1
arms	1
and	1
strangled	1
him,	1
calling	1
to	1
mind	1
seasonably	1
the	1
death	1
which	1
Hercules	1
inflicted	1
on	1
Antæus,	1
the	1
fierce	1
giant	1
that	1
they	1
say	1
was	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Terra.	1
I	1
would	1
infer	1
from	1
what	1
I	1
have	1
mentioned	1
that	1
perhaps	1
I	1
may	1
have	1
some	1
gift	1
of	1
this	1
kind,	1
not	1
that	1
of	1
being	1
invulnerable,	1
because	1
experience	1
has	1
many	1
times	1
proved	1
to	1
me	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
of	1
tender	1
flesh	1
and	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
impenetrable;	1
nor	1
that	1
of	1
being	1
proof	1
against	1
enchantment,	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
already	1
seen	1
myself	1
thrust	1
into	1
a	1
cage,	1
in	1
which	1
all	1
the	1
world	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
been	1
able	1
to	1
confine	1
me	1
except	1
by	1
force	1
of	1
enchantments.	1
But	1
as	1
I	1
delivered	1
myself	1
from	1
that	1
one,	1
I	1
am	1
inclined	1
to	1
believe	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
other	1
that	1
can	1
hurt	1
me;	1
and	1
so,	1
these	1
enchanters,	1
seeing	1
that	1
they	1
cannot	1
exert	1
their	1
vile	1
craft	1
against	1
my	1
person,	1
revenge	1
themselves	1
on	1
what	1
I	1
love	1
most,	1
and	1
seek	1
to	1
rob	1
me	1
of	1
life	1
by	1
maltreating	1
that	1
of	1
Dulcinea	1
in	1
whom	1
I	1
live;	1
and	1
therefore	1
I	1
am	1
convinced	1
that	1
when	1
my	1
squire	1
carried	1
my	1
message	1
to	1
her,	1
they	1
changed	1
her	1
into	1
a	1
common	1
peasant	1
girl,	1
engaged	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
mean	1
occupation	1
as	1
sifting	1
wheat;	1
I	1
have	1
already	1
said,	1
however,	1
that	1
that	1
wheat	1
was	1
not	1
red	1
wheat,	1
nor	1
wheat	1
at	1
all,	1
but	1
grains	1
of	1
orient	1
pearl.	1
And	1
as	1
a	1
proof	1
of	1
all	1
this,	1
I	1
must	1
tell	1
your	1
highnesses	1
that,	1
coming	1
to	1
El	1
Toboso	1
a	1
short	1
time	1
back,	1
I	1
was	1
altogether	1
unable	1
to	1
discover	1
the	1
palace	1
of	1
Dulcinea;	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
next	1
day,	1
though	1
Sancho,	1
my	1
squire,	1
saw	1
her	1
in	1
her	1
own	1
proper	1
shape,	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
fairest	1
in	1
the	1
world,	1
to	1
me	1
she	1
appeared	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
coarse,	1
ill-favoured	1
farm-wench,	1
and	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
a	1
well-spoken	1
one,	1
she	1
who	1
is	1
propriety	1
itself.	1
And	1
so,	1
as	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
and,	1
so	1
far	1
as	1
one	1
can	1
judge,	1
cannot	1
be	1
enchanted,	1
she	1
it	1
is	1
that	1
is	1
enchanted,	1
that	1
is	1
smitten,	1
that	1
is	1
altered,	1
changed,	1
and	1
transformed;	1
in	1
her	1
have	1
my	1
enemies	1
revenged	1
themselves	1
upon	1
me,	1
and	1
for	1
her	1
shall	1
I	1
live	1
in	1
ceaseless	1
tears,	1
until	1
I	1
see	1
her	1
in	1
her	1
pristine	1
state.	1
I	1
have	1
mentioned	1
this	1
lest	1
anybody	1
should	1
mind	1
what	1
Sancho	1
said	1
about	1
Dulcinea’s	1
winnowing	1
or	1
sifting;	1
for,	1
as	1
they	1
changed	1
her	1
to	1
me,	1
it	1
is	1
no	1
wonder	1
if	1
they	1
changed	1
her	1
to	1
him.	1
Dulcinea	1
is	1
illustrious	1
and	1
well-born,	1
and	1
of	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
gentle	1
families	1
of	1
El	1
Toboso,	1
which	1
are	1
many,	1
ancient,	1
and	1
good.	1
Therein,	1
most	1
assuredly,	1
not	1
small	1
is	1
the	1
share	1
of	1
the	1
peerless	1
Dulcinea,	1
through	1
whom	1
her	1
town	1
will	1
be	1
famous	1
and	1
celebrated	1
in	1
ages	1
to	1
come,	1
as	1
Troy	1
was	1
through	1
Helen,	1
and	1
Spain	1
through	1
La	1
Cava,	1
though	1
with	1
a	1
better	1
title	1
and	1
tradition.	1
For	1
another	1
thing;	1
I	1
would	1
have	1
your	1
graces	1
understand	1
that	1
Sancho	1
Panza	1
is	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
drollest	1
squires	1
that	1
ever	1
served	1
knight-errant;	1
sometimes	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
simplicity	1
about	1
him	1
so	1
acute	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
an	1
amusement	1
to	1
try	1
and	1
make	1
out	1
whether	1
he	1
is	1
simple	1
or	1
sharp;	1
he	1
has	1
mischievous	1
tricks	1
that	1
stamp	1
him	1
rogue,	1
and	1
blundering	1
ways	1
that	1
prove	1
him	1
a	1
booby;	1
he	1
doubts	1
everything	1
and	1
believes	1
everything;	1
when	1
I	1
fancy	1
he	1
is	1
on	1
the	1
point	1
of	1
coming	1
down	1
headlong	1
from	1
sheer	1
stupidity,	1
he	1
comes	1
out	1
with	1
something	1
shrewd	1
that	1
sends	1
him	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
skies.	1
After	1
all,	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
exchange	1
him	1
for	1
another	1
squire,	1
though	1
I	1
were	1
given	1
a	1
city	1
to	1
boot,	1
and	1
therefore	1
I	1
am	1
in	1
doubt	1
whether	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
well	1
to	1
send	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
government	1
your	1
highness	1
has	1
bestowed	1
upon	1
him;	1
though	1
I	1
perceive	1
in	1
him	1
a	1
certain	1
aptitude	1
for	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
governing,	1
so	1
that,	1
with	1
a	1
little	1
trimming	1
of	1
his	1
understanding,	1
he	1
would	1
manage	1
any	1
government	1
as	1
easily	1
as	1
the	1
king	1
does	1
his	1
taxes;	1
and	1
moreover,	1
we	1
know	1
already	1
ample	1
experience	1
that	1
it	1
does	1
not	1
require	1
much	1
cleverness	1
or	1
much	1
learning	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
governor,	1
for	1
there	1
are	1
a	1
hundred	1
round	1
about	1
us	1
that	1
scarcely	1
know	1
how	1
to	1
read,	1
and	1
govern	1
like	1
gerfalcons.	1
The	1
main	1
point	1
is	1
that	1
they	1
should	1
have	1
good	1
intentions	1
and	1
be	1
desirous	1
of	1
doing	1
right	1
in	1
all	1
things,	1
for	1
they	1
will	1
never	1
be	1
at	1
a	1
loss	1
for	1
persons	1
to	1
advise	1
and	1
direct	1
them	1
in	1
what	1
they	1
have	1
to	1
do,	1
like	1
those	1
knight-governors	1
who,	1
being	1
no	1
lawyers,	1
pronounce	1
sentences	1
with	1
the	1
aid	1
of	1
an	1
assessor.	1
My	1
advice	1
to	1
him	1
will	1
be	1
to	1
take	1
no	1
bribe	1
and	1
surrender	1
no	1
right,	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
some	1
other	1
little	1
matters	1
in	1
reserve,	1
that	1
shall	1
be	1
produced	1
in	1
due	1
season	1
for	1
Sancho’s	1
benefit	1
and	1
the	1
advantage	1
of	1
the	1
island	1
he	1
is	1
to	1
govern.”	1
The	1
duke,	1
duchess,	1
and	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
had	1
reached	1
this	1
point	1
in	1
their	1
conversation,	1
when	1
they	1
heard	1
voices	1
and	1
a	1
great	1
hubbub	1
in	1
the	1
palace,	1
and	1
Sancho	1
burst	1
abruptly	1
into	1
the	1
room	1
all	1
glowing	1
with	1
anger,	1
with	1
a	1
straining-cloth	1
by	1
way	1
of	1
a	1
bib,	1
and	1
followed	1
by	1
several	1
servants,	1
or,	1
more	1
properly	1
speaking,	1
kitchen-boys	1
and	1
other	1
underlings,	1
one	1
of	1
whom	1
carried	1
a	1
small	1
trough	1
full	1
of	1
water,	1
that	1
from	1
its	1
colour	1
and	1
impurity	1
was	1
plainly	1
dishwater.	1
The	1
one	1
with	1
the	1
trough	1
pursued	1
him	1
and	1
followed	1
him	1
everywhere	1
he	1
went,	1
endeavouring	1
with	1
the	1
utmost	1
persistence	1
to	1
thrust	1
it	1
under	1
his	1
chin,	1
while	1
another	1
kitchen-boy	1
seemed	1
anxious	1
to	1
wash	1
his	1
beard.	1
“What	1
is	1
all	1
this,	1
brothers?”	1
asked	1
the	1
duchess.	1
“What	1
is	1
it?	1
What	1
do	1
you	1
want	1
to	1
do	1
to	1
this	1
good	1
man?	1
Do	1
you	1
forget	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
governor-elect?”	1
To	1
which	1
the	1
barber	1
kitchen-boy	1
replied,	1
“The	1
gentleman	1
will	1
not	1
let	1
himself	1
be	1
washed	1
as	1
is	1
customary,	1
and	1
as	1
my	1
lord	1
and	1
the	1
señor	1
his	1
master	1
have	1
been.”	1
“Yes,	1
I	1
will,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
in	1
a	1
great	1
rage;	1
“but	1
I’d	1
like	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
with	1
cleaner	1
towels,	1
clearer	1
lye,	1
and	1
not	1
such	1
dirty	1
hands;	1
for	1
there’s	1
not	1
so	1
much	1
difference	1
between	1
me	1
and	1
my	1
master	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
be	1
washed	1
with	1
angels’	1
water	1
and	1
I	1
with	1
devil’s	1
lye.	1
The	1
customs	1
of	1
countries	1
and	1
princes’	1
palaces	1
are	1
only	1
good	1
so	1
long	1
as	1
they	1
give	1
no	1
annoyance;	1
but	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
washing	1
they	1
have	1
here	1
is	1
worse	1
than	1
doing	1
penance.	1
I	1
have	1
a	1
clean	1
beard,	1
and	1
I	1
don’t	1
require	1
to	1
be	1
refreshed	1
in	1
that	1
fashion,	1
and	1
whoever	1
comes	1
to	1
wash	1
me	1
or	1
touch	1
a	1
hair	1
of	1
my	1
head,	1
I	1
mean	1
to	1
say	1
my	1
beard,	1
with	1
all	1
due	1
respect	1
be	1
it	1
said,	1
I’ll	1
give	1
him	1
a	1
punch	1
that	1
will	1
leave	1
my	1
fist	1
sunk	1
in	1
his	1
skull;	1
for	1
cirimonies	1
and	1
soapings	1
of	1
this	1
sort	1
are	1
more	1
like	1
jokes	1
than	1
the	1
polite	1
attentions	1
of	1
one’s	1
host.”	1
The	1
duchess	1
was	1
ready	1
to	1
die	1
with	1
laughter	1
when	1
she	1
saw	1
Sancho’s	1
rage	1
and	1
heard	1
his	1
words;	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
no	1
pleasure	1
to	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
to	1
see	1
him	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
sorry	1
trim,	1
with	1
the	1
dingy	1
towel	1
about	1
him,	1
and	1
the	1
hangers-on	1
of	1
the	1
kitchen	1
all	1
round	1
him;	1
so	1
making	1
a	1
low	1
bow	1
to	1
the	1
duke	1
and	1
duchess,	1
as	1
if	1
to	1
ask	1
their	1
permission	1
to	1
speak,	1
he	1
addressed	1
the	1
rout	1
in	1
a	1
dignified	1
tone:	1
“Holloa,	1
gentlemen!	1
you	1
let	1
that	1
youth	1
alone,	1
and	1
go	1
back	1
to	1
where	1
you	1
came	1
from,	1
or	1
anywhere	1
else	1
if	1
you	1
like;	1
my	1
squire	1
is	1
as	1
clean	1
as	1
any	1
other	1
person,	1
and	1
those	1
troughs	1
are	1
as	1
bad	1
as	1
narrow	1
thin-necked	1
jars	1
to	1
him;	1
take	1
my	1
advice	1
and	1
leave	1
him	1
alone,	1
for	1
neither	1
he	1
nor	1
I	1
understand	1
joking.”	1
Sancho	1
took	1
the	1
word	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
mouth	1
and	1
went	1
on,	1
“Nay,	1
let	1
them	1
come	1
and	1
try	1
their	1
jokes	1
on	1
the	1
country	1
bumpkin,	1
for	1
it’s	1
about	1
as	1
likely	1
I’ll	1
stand	1
them	1
as	1
that	1
it’s	1
now	1
midnight!	1
Let	1
them	1
bring	1
me	1
a	1
comb	1
here,	1
or	1
what	1
they	1
please,	1
and	1
curry	1
this	1
beard	1
of	1
mine,	1
and	1
if	1
they	1
get	1
anything	1
out	1
of	1
it	1
that	1
offends	1
against	1
cleanliness,	1
let	1
them	1
clip	1
me	1
to	1
the	1
skin.”	1
Upon	1
this,	1
the	1
duchess,	1
laughing	1
all	1
the	1
while,	1
said,	1
“Sancho	1
Panza	1
is	1
right,	1
and	1
always	1
will	1
be	1
in	1
all	1
he	1
says;	1
he	1
is	1
clean,	1
and,	1
as	1
he	1
says	1
himself,	1
he	1
does	1
not	1
require	1
to	1
be	1
washed;	1
and	1
if	1
our	1
ways	1
do	1
not	1
please	1
him,	1
he	1
is	1
free	1
to	1
choose.	1
Besides,	1
you	1
promoters	1
of	1
cleanliness	1
have	1
been	1
excessively	1
careless	1
and	1
thoughtless,	1
I	1
don’t	1
know	1
if	1
I	1
ought	1
not	1
to	1
say	1
audacious,	1
to	1
bring	1
troughs	1
and	1
wooden	1
utensils	1
and	1
kitchen	1
dishclouts,	1
instead	1
of	1
basins	1
and	1
jugs	1
of	1
pure	1
gold	1
and	1
towels	1
of	1
holland,	1
to	1
such	1
a	1
person	1
and	1
such	1
a	1
beard;	1
but,	1
after	1
all,	1
you	1
are	1
ill-conditioned	1
and	1
ill-bred,	1
and	1
spiteful	1
as	1
you	1
are,	1
you	1
cannot	1
help	1
showing	1
the	1
grudge	1
you	1
have	1
against	1
the	1
squires	1
of	1
knights-errant.”	1
The	1
impudent	1
servitors,	1
and	1
even	1
the	1
seneschal	1
who	1
came	1
with	1
them,	1
took	1
the	1
duchess	1
to	1
be	1
speaking	1
in	1
earnest,	1
so	1
they	1
removed	1
the	1
straining-cloth	1
from	1
Sancho’s	1
neck,	1
and	1
with	1
something	1
like	1
shame	1
and	1
confusion	1
of	1
face	1
went	1
off	1
all	1
of	1
them	1
and	1
left	1
him;	1
whereupon	1
he,	1
seeing	1
himself	1
safe	1
out	1
of	1
that	1
extreme	1
danger,	1
as	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
him,	1
ran	1
and	1
fell	1
on	1
his	1
knees	1
before	1
the	1
duchess,	1
saying,	1
“From	1
great	1
ladies	1
great	1
favours	1
may	1
be	1
looked	1
for;	1
this	1
which	1
your	1
grace	1
has	1
done	1
me	1
to-day	1
cannot	1
be	1
requited	1
with	1
less	1
than	1
wishing	1
I	1
was	1
dubbed	1
a	1
knight-errant,	1
to	1
devote	1
myself	1
all	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
my	1
life	1
to	1
the	1
service	1
of	1
so	1
exalted	1
a	1
lady.	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
labouring	1
man,	1
my	1
name	1
is	1
Sancho	1
Panza,	1
I	1
am	1
married,	1
I	1
have	1
children,	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
serving	1
as	1
a	1
squire;	1
if	1
in	1
any	1
one	1
of	1
these	1
ways	1
I	1
can	1
serve	1
your	1
highness,	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
longer	1
in	1
obeying	1
than	1
your	1
grace	1
in	1
commanding.”	1
“It	1
is	1
easy	1
to	1
see,	1
Sancho,”	1
replied	1
the	1
duchess,	1
“that	1
you	1
have	1
learned	1
to	1
be	1
polite	1
in	1
the	1
school	1
of	1
politeness	1
itself;	1
I	1
mean	1
to	1
say	1
it	1
is	1
easy	1
to	1
see	1
that	1
you	1
have	1
been	1
nursed	1
in	1
the	1
bosom	1
of	1
Señor	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
who	1
is,	1
of	1
course,	1
the	1
cream	1
of	1
good	1
breeding	1
and	1
flower	1
of	1
ceremony—or	1
cirimony,	1
as	1
you	1
would	1
say	1
yourself.	1
Fair	1
be	1
the	1
fortunes	1
of	1
such	1
a	1
master	1
and	1
such	1
a	1
servant,	1
the	1
one	1
the	1
cynosure	1
of	1
knight-errantry,	1
the	1
other	1
the	1
star	1
of	1
squirely	1
fidelity!	1
Rise,	1
Sancho,	1
my	1
friend;	1
I	1
will	1
repay	1
your	1
courtesy	1
by	1
taking	1
care	1
that	1
my	1
lord	1
the	1
duke	1
makes	1
good	1
to	1
you	1
the	1
promised	1
gift	1
of	1
the	1
government	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
possible.”	1
With	1
this,	1
the	1
conversation	1
came	1
to	1
an	1
end,	1
and	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
retired	1
to	1
take	1
his	1
midday	1
sleep;	1
but	1
the	1
duchess	1
begged	1
Sancho,	1
unless	1
he	1
had	1
a	1
very	1
great	1
desire	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
sleep,	1
to	1
come	1
and	1
spend	1
the	1
afternoon	1
with	1
her	1
and	1
her	1
damsels	1
in	1
a	1
very	1
cool	1
chamber.	1
Sancho	1
replied	1
that,	1
though	1
he	1
certainly	1
had	1
the	1
habit	1
of	1
sleeping	1
four	1
or	1
five	1
hours	1
in	1
the	1
heat	1
of	1
the	1
day	1
in	1
summer,	1
to	1
serve	1
her	1
excellence	1
he	1
would	1
try	1
with	1
all	1
his	1
might	1
not	1
to	1
sleep	1
even	1
one	1
that	1
day,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
come	1
in	1
obedience	1
to	1
her	1
command,	1
and	1
with	1
that	1
he	1
went	1
off.	1
The	1
duke	1
gave	1
fresh	1
orders	1
with	1
respect	1
to	1
treating	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
as	1
a	1
knight-errant,	1
without	1
departing	1
even	1
in	1
smallest	1
particular	1
from	1
the	1
style	1
in	1
which,	1
as	1
the	1
stories	1
tell	1
us,	1
they	1
used	1
to	1
treat	1
the	1
knights	1
of	1
old.	1

The	1
history	1
records	1
that	1
Sancho	1
did	1
not	1
sleep	1
that	1
afternoon,	1
but	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
keep	1
his	1
word	1
came,	1
before	1
he	1
had	1
well	1
done	1
dinner,	1
to	1
visit	1
the	1
duchess,	1
who,	1
finding	1
enjoyment	1
in	1
listening	1
to	1
him,	1
made	1
him	1
sit	1
down	1
beside	1
her	1
on	1
a	1
low	1
seat,	1
though	1
Sancho,	1
out	1
of	1
pure	1
good	1
breeding,	1
wanted	1
not	1
to	1
sit	1
down;	1
the	1
duchess,	1
however,	1
told	1
him	1
he	1
was	1
to	1
sit	1
down	1
as	1
governor	1
and	1
talk	1
as	1
squire,	1
as	1
in	1
both	1
respects	1
he	1
was	1
worthy	1
of	1
even	1
the	1
chair	1
of	1
the	1
Cid	1
Ruy	1
Diaz	1
the	1
Campeador.	1
Sancho	1
shrugged	1
his	1
shoulders,	1
obeyed,	1
and	1
sat	1
down,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
duchess’s	1
damsels	1
and	1
duennas	1
gathered	1
round	1
him,	1
waiting	1
in	1
profound	1
silence	1
to	1
hear	1
what	1
he	1
would	1
say.	1
It	1
was	1
the	1
duchess,	1
however,	1
who	1
spoke	1
first,	1
saying:	1
“Now	1
that	1
we	1
are	1
alone,	1
and	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
nobody	1
here	1
to	1
overhear	1
us,	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
glad	1
if	1
the	1
señor	1
governor	1
would	1
relieve	1
me	1
of	1
certain	1
doubts	1
I	1
have,	1
rising	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
history	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
that	1
is	1
now	1
in	1
print.	1
One	1
is:	1
inasmuch	1
as	1
worthy	1
Sancho	1
never	1
saw	1
Dulcinea,	1
I	1
mean	1
the	1
lady	1
Dulcinea	1
del	1
Toboso,	1
nor	1
took	1
Don	1
Quixote’s	1
letter	1
to	1
her,	1
for	1
it	1
was	1
left	1
in	1
the	1
memorandum	1
book	1
in	1
the	1
Sierra	1
Morena,	1
how	1
did	1
he	1
dare	1
to	1
invent	1
the	1
answer	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
about	1
finding	1
her	1
sifting	1
wheat,	1
the	1
whole	1
story	1
being	1
a	1
deception	1
and	1
falsehood,	1
and	1
so	1
much	1
to	1
the	1
prejudice	1
of	1
the	1
peerless	1
Dulcinea’s	1
good	1
name,	1
a	1
thing	1
that	1
is	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
becoming	1
the	1
character	1
and	1
fidelity	1
of	1
a	1
good	1
squire?”	1

At	1
these	1
words,	1
Sancho,	1
without	1
uttering	1
one	1
in	1
reply,	1
got	1
up	1
from	1
his	1
chair,	1
and	1
with	1
noiseless	1
steps,	1
with	1
his	1
body	1
bent	1
and	1
his	1
finger	1
on	1
his	1
lips,	1
went	1
all	1
round	1
the	1
room	1
lifting	1
up	1
the	1
hangings;	1
and	1
this	1
done,	1
he	1
came	1
back	1
to	1
his	1
seat	1
and	1
said,	1
“Now,	1
señora,	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
seen	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
one	1
except	1
the	1
bystanders	1
listening	1
to	1
us	1
on	1
the	1
sly,	1
I	1
will	1
answer	1
what	1
you	1
have	1
asked	1
me,	1
and	1
all	1
you	1
may	1
ask	1
me,	1
without	1
fear	1
or	1
dread.	1
And	1
the	1
first	1
thing	1
I	1
have	1
got	1
to	1
say	1
is,	1
that	1
for	1
my	1
own	1
part	1
I	1
hold	1
my	1
master	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
to	1
be	1
stark	1
mad,	1
though	1
sometimes	1
he	1
says	1
things	1
that,	1
to	1
my	1
mind,	1
and	1
indeed	1
everybody’s	1
that	1
listens	1
to	1
him,	1
are	1
so	1
wise,	1
and	1
run	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
straight	1
furrow,	1
that	1
Satan	1
himself	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
said	1
them	1
better;	1
but	1
for	1
all	1
that,	1
really,	1
and	1
beyond	1
all	1
question,	1
it’s	1
my	1
firm	1
belief	1
he	1
is	1
cracked.	1
Well,	1
then,	1
as	1
this	1
is	1
clear	1
to	1
my	1
mind,	1
I	1
can	1
venture	1
to	1
make	1
him	1
believe	1
things	1
that	1
have	1
neither	1
head	1
nor	1
tail,	1
like	1
that	1
affair	1
of	1
the	1
answer	1
to	1
the	1
letter,	1
and	1
that	1
other	1
of	1
six	1
or	1
eight	1
days	1
ago,	1
which	1
is	1
not	1
yet	1
in	1
history,	1
that	1
is	1
to	1
say,	1
the	1
affair	1
of	1
the	1
enchantment	1
of	1
my	1
lady	1
Dulcinea;	1
for	1
I	1
made	1
him	1
believe	1
she	1
is	1
enchanted,	1
though	1
there’s	1
no	1
more	1
truth	1
in	1
it	1
than	1
over	1
the	1
hills	1
of	1
Úbeda.”	1
The	1
duchess	1
begged	1
him	1
to	1
tell	1
her	1
about	1
the	1
enchantment	1
or	1
deception,	1
so	1
Sancho	1
told	1
the	1
whole	1
story	1
exactly	1
as	1
it	1
had	1
happened,	1
and	1
his	1
hearers	1
were	1
not	1
a	1
little	1
amused	1
by	1
it;	1
and	1
then	1
resuming,	1
the	1
duchess	1
said,	1
“In	1
consequence	1
of	1
what	1
worthy	1
Sancho	1
has	1
told	1
me,	1
a	1
doubt	1
starts	1
up	1
in	1
my	1
mind,	1
and	1
there	1
comes	1
a	1
kind	1
of	1
whisper	1
to	1
my	1
ear	1
that	1
says,	1
‘If	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
be	1
mad,	1
crazy,	1
and	1
cracked,	1
and	1
Sancho	1
Panza	1
his	1
squire	1
knows	1
it,	1
and,	1
notwithstanding,	1
serves	1
and	1
follows	1
him,	1
and	1
goes	1
trusting	1
to	1
his	1
empty	1
promises,	1
there	1
can	1
be	1
no	1
doubt	1
he	1
must	1
be	1
still	1
madder	1
and	1
sillier	1
than	1
his	1
master;	1
and	1
that	1
being	1
so,	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
cast	1
in	1
your	1
teeth,	1
señora	1
duchess,	1
if	1
you	1
give	1
the	1
said	1
Sancho	1
an	1
island	1
to	1
govern;	1
for	1
how	1
will	1
he	1
who	1
does	1
not	1
know	1
how	1
to	1
govern	1
himself	1
know	1
how	1
to	1
govern	1
others?’”	1
“By	1
God,	1
señora,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“but	1
that	1
doubt	1
comes	1
timely;	1
but	1
your	1
grace	1
may	1
say	1
it	1
out,	1
and	1
speak	1
plainly,	1
or	1
as	1
you	1
like;	1
for	1
I	1
know	1
what	1
you	1
say	1
is	1
true,	1
and	1
if	1
I	1
were	1
wise	1
I	1
should	1
have	1
left	1
my	1
master	1
long	1
ago;	1
but	1
this	1
was	1
my	1
fate,	1
this	1
was	1
my	1
bad	1
luck;	1
I	1
can’t	1
help	1
it,	1
I	1
must	1
follow	1
him;	1
we’re	1
from	1
the	1
same	1
village,	1
I’ve	1
eaten	1
his	1
bread,	1
I’m	1
fond	1
of	1
him,	1
I’m	1
grateful,	1
he	1
gave	1
me	1
his	1
ass-colts,	1
and	1
above	1
all	1
I’m	1
faithful;	1
so	1
it’s	1
quite	1
impossible	1
for	1
anything	1
to	1
separate	1
us,	1
except	1
the	1
pickaxe	1
and	1
shovel.	1
And	1
if	1
your	1
highness	1
does	1
not	1
like	1
to	1
give	1
me	1
the	1
government	1
you	1
promised,	1
God	1
made	1
me	1
without	1
it,	1
and	1
maybe	1
your	1
not	1
giving	1
it	1
to	1
me	1
will	1
be	1
all	1
the	1
better	1
for	1
my	1
conscience,	1
for	1
fool	1
as	1
I	1
am	1
I	1
know	1
the	1
proverb	1
‘to	1
her	1
hurt	1
the	1
ant	1
got	1
wings,’	1
and	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
that	1
Sancho	1
the	1
squire	1
will	1
get	1
to	1
heaven	1
sooner	1
than	1
Sancho	1
the	1
governor.	1
‘They	1
make	1
as	1
good	1
bread	1
here	1
as	1
in	1
France,’	1
and	1
‘by	1
night	1
all	1
cats	1
are	1
grey,’	1
and	1
‘a	1
hard	1
case	1
enough	1
his,	1
who	1
hasn’t	1
broken	1
his	1
fast	1
at	1
two	1
in	1
the	1
afternoon,’	1
and	1
‘there’s	1
no	1
stomach	1
a	1
hand’s	1
breadth	1
bigger	1
than	1
another,’	1
and	1
the	1
same	1
can	1
be	1
filled	1
‘with	1
straw	1
or	1
hay,’	1
as	1
the	1
saying	1
is,	1
and	1
‘the	1
little	1
birds	1
of	1
the	1
field	1
have	1
God	1
for	1
their	1
purveyor	1
and	1
caterer,’	1
and	1
‘four	1
yards	1
of	1
Cuenca	1
frieze	1
keep	1
one	1
warmer	1
than	1
four	1
of	1
Segovia	1
broad-cloth,’	1
and	1
‘when	1
we	1
quit	1
this	1
world	1
and	1
are	1
put	1
underground	1
the	1
prince	1
travels	1
by	1
as	1
narrow	1
a	1
path	1
as	1
the	1
journeyman,’	1
and	1
‘the	1
Pope’s	1
body	1
does	1
not	1
take	1
up	1
more	1
feet	1
of	1
earth	1
than	1
the	1
sacristan’s,’	1
for	1
all	1
that	1
the	1
one	1
is	1
higher	1
than	1
the	1
other;	1
for	1
when	1
we	1
go	1
to	1
our	1
graves	1
we	1
all	1
pack	1
ourselves	1
up	1
and	1
make	1
ourselves	1
small,	1
or	1
rather	1
they	1
pack	1
us	1
up	1
and	1
make	1
us	1
small	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
us,	1
and	1
then—good	1
night	1
to	1
us.	1
And	1
I	1
say	1
once	1
more,	1
if	1
your	1
ladyship	1
does	1
not	1
like	1
to	1
give	1
me	1
the	1
island	1
because	1
I’m	1
a	1
fool,	1
like	1
a	1
wise	1
man	1
I	1
will	1
take	1
care	1
to	1
give	1
myself	1
no	1
trouble	1
about	1
it;	1
I	1
have	1
heard	1
say	1
that	1
‘behind	1
the	1
cross	1
there’s	1
the	1
devil,’	1
and	1
that	1
‘all	1
that	1
glitters	1
is	1
not	1
gold,’	1
and	1
that	1
from	1
among	1
the	1
oxen,	1
and	1
the	1
ploughs,	1
and	1
the	1
yokes,	1
Wamba	1
the	1
husbandman	1
was	1
taken	1
to	1
be	1
made	1
King	1
of	1
Spain,	1
and	1
from	1
among	1
brocades,	1
and	1
pleasures,	1
and	1
riches,	1
Roderick	1
was	1
taken	1
to	1
be	1
devoured	1
by	1
adders,	1
if	1
the	1
verses	1
of	1
the	1
old	1
ballads	1
don’t	1
lie.”	1
“To	1
be	1
sure	1
they	1
don’t	1
lie!”	1
exclaimed	1
Doña	1
Rodriguez,	1
the	1
duenna,	1
who	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
listeners.	1
“Why,	1
there’s	1
a	1
ballad	1
that	1
says	1
they	1
put	1
King	1
Rodrigo	1
alive	1
into	1
a	1
tomb	1
full	1
of	1
toads,	1
and	1
adders,	1
and	1
lizards,	1
and	1
that	1
two	1
days	1
afterwards	1
the	1
king,	1
in	1
a	1
plaintive,	1
feeble	1
voice,	1
cried	1
out	1
from	1
within	1
the	1
tomb-	1
They	1
gnaw	1
me	1
now,	1
they	1
gnaw	1
me	1
now,	1
There	1
where	1
I	1
most	1
did	1
sin.	1
And	1
according	1
to	1
that	1
the	1
gentleman	1
has	1
good	1
reason	1
to	1
say	1
he	1
would	1
rather	1
be	1
a	1
labouring	1
man	1
than	1
a	1
king,	1
if	1
vermin	1
are	1
to	1
eat	1
him.”	1
The	1
duchess	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
laughing	1
at	1
the	1
simplicity	1
of	1
her	1
duenna,	1
or	1
wondering	1
at	1
the	1
language	1
and	1
proverbs	1
of	1
Sancho,	1
to	1
whom	1
she	1
said,	1
“Worthy	1
Sancho	1
knows	1
very	1
well	1
that	1
when	1
once	1
a	1
knight	1
has	1
made	1
a	1
promise	1
he	1
strives	1
to	1
keep	1
it,	1
though	1
it	1
should	1
cost	1
him	1
his	1
life.	1
My	1
lord	1
and	1
husband	1
the	1
duke,	1
though	1
not	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
errant	1
sort,	1
is	1
none	1
the	1
less	1
a	1
knight	1
for	1
that	1
reason,	1
and	1
will	1
keep	1
his	1
word	1
about	1
the	1
promised	1
island,	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
the	1
envy	1
and	1
malice	1
of	1
the	1
world.	1
Let	1
Sancho	1
be	1
of	1
good	1
cheer;	1
for	1
when	1
he	1
least	1
expects	1
it	1
he	1
will	1
find	1
himself	1
seated	1
on	1
the	1
throne	1
of	1
his	1
island	1
and	1
seat	1
of	1
dignity,	1
and	1
will	1
take	1
possession	1
of	1
his	1
government	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
discard	1
it	1
for	1
another	1
of	1
three-bordered	1
brocade.	1
The	1
charge	1
I	1
give	1
him	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
careful	1
how	1
he	1
governs	1
his	1
vassals,	1
bearing	1
in	1
mind	1
that	1
they	1
are	1
all	1
loyal	1
and	1
well-born.”	1
“As	1
to	1
governing	1
them	1
well,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“there’s	1
no	1
need	1
of	1
charging	1
me	1
to	1
do	1
that,	1
for	1
I’m	1
kind-hearted	1
by	1
nature,	1
and	1
full	1
of	1
compassion	1
for	1
the	1
poor;	1
there’s	1
no	1
stealing	1
the	1
loaf	1
from	1
him	1
who	1
kneads	1
and	1
bakes;’	1
and	1
by	1
my	1
faith	1
it	1
won’t	1
do	1
to	1
throw	1
false	1
dice	1
with	1
me;	1
I	1
am	1
an	1
old	1
dog,	1
and	1
I	1
know	1
all	1
about	1
‘tus,	1
tus;’	1
I	1
can	1
be	1
wide-awake	1
if	1
need	1
be,	1
and	1
I	1
don’t	1
let	1
clouds	1
come	1
before	1
my	1
eyes,	1
for	1
I	1
know	1
where	1
the	1
shoe	1
pinches	1
me;	1
I	1
say	1
so,	1
because	1
with	1
me	1
the	1
good	1
will	1
have	1
support	1
and	1
protection,	1
and	1
the	1
bad	1
neither	1
footing	1
nor	1
access.	1
And	1
it	1
seems	1
to	1
me	1
that,	1
in	1
governments,	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
beginning	1
is	1
everything;	1
and	1
maybe,	1
after	1
having	1
been	1
governor	1
a	1
fortnight,	1
I’ll	1
take	1
kindly	1
to	1
the	1
work	1
and	1
know	1
more	1
about	1
it	1
than	1
the	1
field	1
labour	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
brought	1
up	1
to.”	1
“You	1
are	1
right,	1
Sancho,”	1
said	1
the	1
duchess,	1
“for	1
no	1
one	1
is	1
born	1
ready	1
taught,	1
and	1
the	1
bishops	1
are	1
made	1
out	1
of	1
men	1
and	1
not	1
out	1
of	1
stones.	1
But	1
to	1
return	1
to	1
the	1
subject	1
we	1
were	1
discussing	1
just	1
now,	1
the	1
enchantment	1
of	1
the	1
lady	1
Dulcinea,	1
I	1
look	1
upon	1
it	1
as	1
certain,	1
and	1
something	1
more	1
than	1
evident,	1
that	1
Sancho’s	1
idea	1
of	1
practising	1
a	1
deception	1
upon	1
his	1
master,	1
making	1
him	1
believe	1
that	1
the	1
peasant	1
girl	1
was	1
Dulcinea	1
and	1
that	1
if	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
recognise	1
her	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
because	1
she	1
was	1
enchanted,	1
was	1
all	1
a	1
device	1
of	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
enchanters	1
that	1
persecute	1
Don	1
Quixote.	1
For	1
in	1
truth	1
and	1
earnest,	1
I	1
know	1
from	1
good	1
authority	1
that	1
the	1
coarse	1
country	1
wench	1
who	1
jumped	1
up	1
on	1
the	1
ass	1
was	1
and	1
is	1
Dulcinea	1
del	1
Toboso,	1
and	1
that	1
worthy	1
Sancho,	1
though	1
he	1
fancies	1
himself	1
the	1
deceiver,	1
is	1
the	1
one	1
that	1
is	1
deceived;	1
and	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
more	1
reason	1
to	1
doubt	1
the	1
truth	1
of	1
this,	1
than	1
of	1
anything	1
else	1
we	1
never	1
saw.	1
Señor	1
Sancho	1
Panza	1
must	1
know	1
that	1
we	1
too	1
have	1
enchanters	1
here	1
that	1
are	1
well	1
disposed	1
to	1
us,	1
and	1
tell	1
us	1
what	1
goes	1
on	1
in	1
the	1
world,	1
plainly	1
and	1
distinctly,	1
without	1
subterfuge	1
or	1
deception;	1
and	1
believe	1
me,	1
Sancho,	1
that	1
agile	1
country	1
lass	1
was	1
and	1
is	1
Dulcinea	1
del	1
Toboso,	1
who	1
is	1
as	1
much	1
enchanted	1
as	1
the	1
mother	1
that	1
bore	1
her;	1
and	1
when	1
we	1
least	1
expect	1
it,	1
we	1
shall	1
see	1
her	1
in	1
her	1
own	1
proper	1
form,	1
and	1
then	1
Sancho	1
will	1
be	1
disabused	1
of	1
the	1
error	1
he	1
is	1
under	1
at	1
present.”	1
“All	1
that’s	1
very	1
possible,”	1
said	1
Sancho	1
Panza;	1
“and	1
now	1
I’m	1
willing	1
to	1
believe	1
what	1
my	1
master	1
says	1
about	1
what	1
he	1
saw	1
in	1
the	1
cave	1
of	1
Montesinos,	1
where	1
he	1
says	1
he	1
saw	1
the	1
lady	1
Dulcinea	1
del	1
Toboso	1
in	1
the	1
very	1
same	1
dress	1
and	1
apparel	1
that	1
I	1
said	1
I	1
had	1
seen	1
her	1
in	1
when	1
I	1
enchanted	1
her	1
all	1
to	1
please	1
myself.	1
It	1
must	1
be	1
all	1
exactly	1
the	1
other	1
way,	1
as	1
your	1
ladyship	1
says;	1
because	1
it	1
is	1
impossible	1
to	1
suppose	1
that	1
out	1
of	1
my	1
poor	1
wit	1
such	1
a	1
cunning	1
trick	1
could	1
be	1
concocted	1
in	1
a	1
moment,	1
nor	1
do	1
I	1
think	1
my	1
master	1
is	1
so	1
mad	1
that	1
by	1
my	1
weak	1
and	1
feeble	1
persuasion	1
he	1
could	1
be	1
made	1
to	1
believe	1
a	1
thing	1
so	1
out	1
of	1
all	1
reason.	1
But,	1
señora,	1
your	1
excellence	1
must	1
not	1
therefore	1
think	1
me	1
ill-disposed,	1
for	1
a	1
dolt	1
like	1
me	1
is	1
not	1
bound	1
to	1
see	1
into	1
the	1
thoughts	1
and	1
plots	1
of	1
those	1
vile	1
enchanters.	1
I	1
invented	1
all	1
that	1
to	1
escape	1
my	1
master’s	1
scolding,	1
and	1
not	1
with	1
any	1
intention	1
of	1
hurting	1
him;	1
and	1
if	1
it	1
has	1
turned	1
out	1
differently,	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
God	1
in	1
heaven	1
who	1
judges	1
our	1
hearts.”	1
“That	1
is	1
true,”	1
said	1
the	1
duchess;	1
“but	1
tell	1
me,	1
Sancho,	1
what	1
is	1
this	1
you	1
say	1
about	1
the	1
cave	1
of	1
Montesinos,	1
for	1
I	1
should	1
like	1
to	1
know.”	1
Sancho	1
upon	1
this	1
related	1
to	1
her,	1
word	1
for	1
word,	1
what	1
has	1
been	1
said	1
already	1
touching	1
that	1
adventure,	1
and	1
having	1
heard	1
it	1
the	1
duchess	1
said,	1
“From	1
this	1
occurrence	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
inferred	1
that,	1
as	1
the	1
great	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
says	1
he	1
saw	1
there	1
the	1
same	1
country	1
wench	1
Sancho	1
saw	1
on	1
the	1
way	1
from	1
El	1
Toboso,	1
it	1
is,	1
no	1
doubt,	1
Dulcinea,	1
and	1
that	1
there	1
are	1
some	1
very	1
active	1
and	1
exceedingly	1
busy	1
enchanters	1
about.”	1
“So	1
I	1
say,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“and	1
if	1
my	1
lady	1
Dulcinea	1
is	1
enchanted,	1
so	1
much	1
the	1
worse	1
for	1
her,	1
and	1
I’m	1
not	1
going	1
to	1
pick	1
a	1
quarrel	1
with	1
my	1
master’s	1
enemies,	1
who	1
seem	1
to	1
be	1
many	1
and	1
spiteful.	1
The	1
truth	1
is	1
that	1
the	1
one	1
I	1
saw	1
was	1
a	1
country	1
wench,	1
and	1
I	1
set	1
her	1
down	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
country	1
wench;	1
and	1
if	1
that	1
was	1
Dulcinea	1
it	1
must	1
not	1
be	1
laid	1
at	1
my	1
door,	1
nor	1
should	1
I	1
be	1
called	1
to	1
answer	1
for	1
it	1
or	1
take	1
the	1
consequences.	1
But	1
they	1
must	1
go	1
nagging	1
at	1
me	1
at	1
every	1
step—‘Sancho	1
said	1
it,	1
Sancho	1
did	1
it,	1
Sancho	1
here,	1
Sancho	1
there,’	1
as	1
if	1
Sancho	1
was	1
nobody	1
at	1
all,	1
and	1
not	1
that	1
same	1
Sancho	1
Panza	1
that’s	1
now	1
going	1
all	1
over	1
the	1
world	1
in	1
books,	1
so	1
Samson	1
Carrasco	1
told	1
me,	1
and	1
he’s	1
at	1
any	1
rate	1
one	1
that’s	1
a	1
bachelor	1
of	1
Salamanca;	1
and	1
people	1
of	1
that	1
sort	1
can’t	1
lie,	1
except	1
when	1
the	1
whim	1
seizes	1
them	1
or	1
they	1
have	1
some	1
very	1
good	1
reason	1
for	1
it.	1
So	1
there’s	1
no	1
occasion	1
for	1
anybody	1
to	1
quarrel	1
with	1
me;	1
and	1
then	1
I	1
have	1
a	1
good	1
character,	1
and,	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
heard	1
my	1
master	1
say,	1
‘a	1
good	1
name	1
is	1
better	1
than	1
great	1
riches;’	1
let	1
them	1
only	1
stick	1
me	1
into	1
this	1
government	1
and	1
they’ll	1
see	1
wonders,	1
for	1
one	1
who	1
has	1
been	1
a	1
good	1
squire	1
will	1
be	1
a	1
good	1
governor.”	1
“All	1
worthy	1
Sancho’s	1
observations,”	1
said	1
the	1
duchess,	1
“are	1
Catonian	1
sentences,	1
or	1
at	1
any	1
rate	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
very	1
heart	1
of	1
Michael	1
Verino	1
himself,	1
who	1
_florentibus	1
occidit	1
annis_.	1
In	1
fact,	1
to	1
speak	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
style,	1
‘under	1
a	1
bad	1
cloak	1
there’s	1
often	1
a	1
good	1
drinker.’”	1
“Indeed,	1
señora,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“I	1
never	1
yet	1
drank	1
out	1
of	1
wickedness;	1
from	1
thirst	1
I	1
have	1
very	1
likely,	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
nothing	1
of	1
the	1
hypocrite	1
in	1
me;	1
I	1
drink	1
when	1
I’m	1
inclined,	1
or,	1
if	1
I’m	1
not	1
inclined,	1
when	1
they	1
offer	1
it	1
to	1
me,	1
so	1
as	1
not	1
to	1
look	1
either	1
strait-laced	1
or	1
ill-bred;	1
for	1
when	1
a	1
friend	1
drinks	1
one’s	1
health	1
what	1
heart	1
can	1
be	1
so	1
hard	1
as	1
not	1
to	1
return	1
it?	1
But	1
if	1
I	1
put	1
on	1
my	1
shoes	1
I	1
don’t	1
dirty	1
them;	1
besides,	1
squires	1
to	1
knights-errant	1
mostly	1
drink	1
water,	1
for	1
they	1
are	1
always	1
wandering	1
among	1
woods,	1
forests	1
and	1
meadows,	1
mountains	1
and	1
crags,	1
without	1
a	1
drop	1
of	1
wine	1
to	1
be	1
had	1
if	1
they	1
gave	1
their	1
eyes	1
for	1
it.”	1
“So	1
I	1
believe,”	1
said	1
the	1
duchess;	1
“and	1
now	1
let	1
Sancho	1
go	1
and	1
take	1
his	1
sleep,	1
and	1
we	1
will	1
talk	1
by-and-by	1
at	1
greater	1
length,	1
and	1
settle	1
how	1
he	1
may	1
soon	1
go	1
and	1
stick	1
himself	1
into	1
the	1
government,	1
as	1
he	1
says.”	1
Sancho	1
once	1
more	1
kissed	1
the	1
duchess’s	1
hand,	1
and	1
entreated	1
her	1
to	1
let	1
good	1
care	1
be	1
taken	1
of	1
his	1
Dapple,	1
for	1
he	1
was	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
his	1
eyes.	1
“What	1
is	1
Dapple?”	1
said	1
the	1
duchess.	1
“My	1
ass,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“which,	1
not	1
to	1
mention	1
him	1
by	1
that	1
name,	1
I’m	1
accustomed	1
to	1
call	1
Dapple;	1
I	1
begged	1
this	1
lady	1
duenna	1
here	1
to	1
take	1
care	1
of	1
him	1
when	1
I	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
castle,	1
and	1
she	1
got	1
as	1
angry	1
as	1
if	1
I	1
had	1
said	1
she	1
was	1
ugly	1
or	1
old,	1
though	1
it	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
more	1
natural	1
and	1
proper	1
for	1
duennas	1
to	1
feed	1
asses	1
than	1
to	1
ornament	1
chambers.	1
God	1
bless	1
me!	1
what	1
a	1
spite	1
a	1
gentleman	1
of	1
my	1
village	1
had	1
against	1
these	1
ladies!”	1
“He	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
some	1
clown,”	1
said	1
Doña	1
Rodriguez	1
the	1
duenna;	1
“for	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
a	1
gentleman	1
and	1
well-born	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
exalted	1
them	1
higher	1
than	1
the	1
horns	1
of	1
the	1
moon.”	1
“That	1
will	1
do,”	1
said	1
the	1
duchess;	1
“no	1
more	1
of	1
this;	1
hush,	1
Doña	1
Rodriguez,	1
and	1
let	1
Señor	1
Panza	1
rest	1
easy	1
and	1
leave	1
the	1
treatment	1
of	1
Dapple	1
in	1
my	1
charge,	1
for	1
as	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
treasure	1
of	1
Sancho’s,	1
I’ll	1
put	1
him	1
on	1
the	1
apple	1
of	1
my	1
eye.”	1
“It	1
will	1
be	1
enough	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
stable,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“for	1
neither	1
he	1
nor	1
I	1
are	1
worthy	1
to	1
rest	1
a	1
moment	1
in	1
the	1
apple	1
of	1
your	1
highness’s	1
eye,	1
and	1
I’d	1
as	1
soon	1
stab	1
myself	1
as	1
consent	1
to	1
it;	1
for	1
though	1
my	1
master	1
says	1
that	1
in	1
civilities	1
it	1
is	1
better	1
to	1
lose	1
by	1
a	1
card	1
too	1
many	1
than	1
a	1
card	1
too	1
few,	1
when	1
it	1
comes	1
to	1
civilities	1
to	1
asses	1
we	1
must	1
mind	1
what	1
we	1
are	1
about	1
and	1
keep	1
within	1
due	1
bounds.”	1
“Take	1
him	1
to	1
your	1
government,	1
Sancho,”	1
said	1
the	1
duchess,	1
“and	1
there	1
you	1
will	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
make	1
as	1
much	1
of	1
him	1
as	1
you	1
like,	1
and	1
even	1
release	1
him	1
from	1
work	1
and	1
pension	1
him	1
off.”	1
“Don’t	1
think,	1
señora	1
duchess,	1
that	1
you	1
have	1
said	1
anything	1
absurd,”	1
said	1
Sancho;	1
“I	1
have	1
seen	1
more	1
than	1
two	1
asses	1
go	1
to	1
governments,	1
and	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
take	1
mine	1
with	1
me	1
would	1
be	1
nothing	1
new.”	1
Sancho’s	1
words	1
made	1
the	1
duchess	1
laugh	1
again	1
and	1
gave	1
her	1
fresh	1
amusement,	1
and	1
dismissing	1
him	1
to	1
sleep	1
she	1
went	1
away	1
to	1
tell	1
the	1
duke	1
the	1
conversation	1
she	1
had	1
had	1
with	1
him,	1
and	1
between	1
them	1
they	1
plotted	1
and	1
arranged	1
to	1
play	1
a	1
joke	1
upon	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
that	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
rare	1
one	1
and	1
entirely	1
in	1
knight-errantry	1
style,	1
and	1
in	1
that	1
same	1
style	1
they	1
practised	1
several	1
upon	1
him,	1
so	1
much	1
in	1
keeping	1
and	1
so	1
clever	1
that	1
they	1
form	1
the	1
best	1
adventures	1
this	1
great	1
history	1
contains.	1

Great	1
was	1
the	1
pleasure	1
the	1
duke	1
and	1
duchess	1
took	1
in	1
the	1
conversation	1
of	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
and	1
Sancho	1
Panza;	1
and,	1
more	1
bent	1
than	1
ever	1
upon	1
the	1
plan	1
they	1
had	1
of	1
practising	1
some	1
jokes	1
upon	1
them	1
that	1
should	1
have	1
the	1
look	1
and	1
appearance	1
of	1
adventures,	1
they	1
took	1
as	1
their	1
basis	1
of	1
action	1
what	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
had	1
already	1
told	1
them	1
about	1
the	1
cave	1
of	1
Montesinos,	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
play	1
him	1
a	1
famous	1
one.	1
But	1
what	1
the	1
duchess	1
marvelled	1
at	1
above	1
all	1
was	1
that	1
Sancho’s	1
simplicity	1
could	1
be	1
so	1
great	1
as	1
to	1
make	1
him	1
believe	1
as	1
absolute	1
truth	1
that	1
Dulcinea	1
had	1
been	1
enchanted,	1
when	1
it	1
was	1
he	1
himself	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
the	1
enchanter	1
and	1
trickster	1
in	1
the	1
business.	1
Having,	1
therefore,	1
instructed	1
their	1
servants	1
in	1
everything	1
they	1
were	1
to	1
do,	1
six	1
days	1
afterwards	1
they	1
took	1
him	1
out	1
to	1
hunt,	1
with	1
as	1
great	1
a	1
retinue	1
of	1
huntsmen	1
and	1
beaters	1
as	1
a	1
crowned	1
king.	1
They	1
presented	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
with	1
a	1
hunting	1
suit,	1
and	1
Sancho	1
with	1
another	1
of	1
the	1
finest	1
green	1
cloth;	1
but	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
declined	1
to	1
put	1
his	1
on,	1
saying	1
that	1
he	1
must	1
soon	1
return	1
to	1
the	1
hard	1
pursuit	1
of	1
arms,	1
and	1
could	1
not	1
carry	1
wardrobes	1
or	1
stores	1
with	1
him.	1
Sancho,	1
however,	1
took	1
what	1
they	1
gave	1
him,	1
meaning	1
to	1
sell	1
it	1
at	1
the	1
first	1
opportunity.	1
The	1
appointed	1
day	1
having	1
arrived,	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
armed	1
himself,	1
and	1
Sancho	1
arrayed	1
himself,	1
and	1
mounted	1
on	1
his	1
Dapple	1
(for	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
give	1
him	1
up	1
though	1
they	1
offered	1
him	1
a	1
horse),	1
he	1
placed	1
himself	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
the	1
troop	1
of	1
huntsmen.	1
The	1
duchess	1
came	1
out	1
splendidly	1
attired,	1
and	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
in	1
pure	1
courtesy	1
and	1
politeness,	1
held	1
the	1
rein	1
of	1
her	1
palfrey,	1
though	1
the	1
duke	1
wanted	1
not	1
to	1
allow	1
him;	1
and	1
at	1
last	1
they	1
reached	1
a	1
wood	1
that	1
lay	1
between	1
two	1
high	1
mountains,	1
where,	1
after	1
occupying	1
various	1
posts,	1
ambushes,	1
and	1
paths,	1
and	1
distributing	1
the	1
party	1
in	1
different	1
positions,	1
the	1
hunt	1
began	1
with	1
great	1
noise,	1
shouting,	1
and	1
hallooing,	1
so	1
that,	1
between	1
the	1
baying	1
of	1
the	1
hounds	1
and	1
the	1
blowing	1
of	1
the	1
horns,	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
hear	1
one	1
another.	1
The	1
duchess	1
dismounted,	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
sharp	1
boar-spear	1
in	1
her	1
hand	1
posted	1
herself	1
where	1
she	1
knew	1
the	1
wild	1
boars	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
habit	1
of	1
passing.	1
The	1
duke	1
and	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
likewise	1
dismounted	1
and	1
placed	1
themselves	1
one	1
at	1
each	1
side	1
of	1
her.	1
Sancho	1
took	1
up	1
a	1
position	1
in	1
the	1
rear	1
of	1
all	1
without	1
dismounting	1
from	1
Dapple,	1
whom	1
he	1
dared	1
not	1
desert	1
lest	1
some	1
mischief	1
should	1
befall	1
him.	1
Scarcely	1
had	1
they	1
taken	1
their	1
stand	1
in	1
a	1
line	1
with	1
several	1
of	1
their	1
servants,	1
when	1
they	1
saw	1
a	1
huge	1
boar,	1
closely	1
pressed	1
by	1
the	1
hounds	1
and	1
followed	1
by	1
the	1
huntsmen,	1
making	1
towards	1
them,	1
grinding	1
his	1
teeth	1
and	1
tusks,	1
and	1
scattering	1
foam	1
from	1
his	1
mouth.	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
saw	1
him	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
bracing	1
his	1
shield	1
on	1
his	1
arm,	1
and	1
drawing	1
his	1
sword,	1
advanced	1
to	1
meet	1
him;	1
the	1
duke	1
with	1
boar-spear	1
did	1
the	1
same;	1
but	1
the	1
duchess	1
would	1
have	1
gone	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
them	1
all	1
had	1
not	1
the	1
duke	1
prevented	1
her.	1
Sancho	1
alone,	1
deserting	1
Dapple	1
at	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
mighty	1
beast,	1
took	1
to	1
his	1
heels	1
as	1
hard	1
as	1
he	1
could	1
and	1
strove	1
in	1
vain	1
to	1
mount	1
a	1
tall	1
oak.	1
As	1
he	1
was	1
clinging	1
to	1
a	1
branch,	1
however,	1
half-way	1
up	1
in	1
his	1
struggle	1
to	1
reach	1
the	1
top,	1
the	1
bough,	1
such	1
was	1
his	1
ill-luck	1
and	1
hard	1
fate,	1
gave	1
way,	1
and	1
caught	1
in	1
his	1
fall	1
by	1
a	1
broken	1
limb	1
of	1
the	1
oak,	1
he	1
hung	1
suspended	1
in	1
the	1
air	1
unable	1
to	1
reach	1
the	1
ground.	1
Finding	1
himself	1
in	1
this	1
position,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
green	1
coat	1
was	1
beginning	1
to	1
tear,	1
and	1
reflecting	1
that	1
if	1
the	1
fierce	1
animal	1
came	1
that	1
way	1
he	1
might	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
get	1
at	1
him,	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
utter	1
such	1
cries,	1
and	1
call	1
for	1
help	1
so	1
earnestly,	1
that	1
all	1
who	1
heard	1
him	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
see	1
him	1
felt	1
sure	1
he	1
must	1
be	1
in	1
the	1
teeth	1
of	1
some	1
wild	1
beast.	1
In	1
the	1
end	1
the	1
tusked	1
boar	1
fell	1
pierced	1
by	1
the	1
blades	1
of	1
the	1
many	1
spears	1
they	1
held	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
him;	1
and	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
turning	1
round	1
at	1
the	1
cries	1
of	1
Sancho,	1
for	1
he	1
knew	1
by	1
them	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
he,	1
saw	1
him	1
hanging	1
from	1
the	1
oak	1
head	1
downwards,	1
with	1
Dapple,	1
who	1
did	1
not	1
forsake	1
him	1
in	1
his	1
distress,	1
close	1
beside	1
him;	1
and	1
Cide	1
Hamete	1
observes	1
that	1
he	1
seldom	1
saw	1
Sancho	1
Panza	1
without	1
seeing	1
Dapple,	1
or	1
Dapple	1
without	1
seeing	1
Sancho	1
Panza;	1
such	1
was	1
their	1
attachment	1
and	1
loyalty	1
one	1
to	1
the	1
other.	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
went	1
over	1
and	1
unhooked	1
Sancho,	1
who,	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
found	1
himself	1
on	1
the	1
ground,	1
looked	1
at	1
the	1
rent	1
in	1
his	1
huntingcoat	1
and	1
was	1
grieved	1
to	1
the	1
heart,	1
for	1
he	1
thought	1
he	1
had	1
got	1
a	1
patrimonial	1
estate	1
in	1
that	1
suit.	1
Meanwhile	1
they	1
had	1
slung	1
the	1
mighty	1
boar	1
across	1
the	1
back	1
of	1
a	1
mule,	1
and	1
having	1
covered	1
it	1
with	1
sprigs	1
of	1
rosemary	1
and	1
branches	1
of	1
myrtle,	1
they	1
bore	1
it	1
away	1
as	1
the	1
spoils	1
of	1
victory	1
to	1
some	1
large	1
field-tents	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
pitched	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
wood,	1
where	1
they	1
found	1
the	1
tables	1
laid	1
and	1
dinner	1
served,	1
in	1
such	1
grand	1
and	1
sumptuous	1
style	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
easy	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
rank	1
and	1
magnificence	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
had	1
provided	1
it.	1
Sancho,	1
as	1
he	1
showed	1
the	1
rents	1
in	1
his	1
torn	1
suit	1
to	1
the	1
duchess,	1
observed,	1
“If	1
we	1
had	1
been	1
hunting	1
hares,	1
or	1
after	1
small	1
birds,	1
my	1
coat	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
safe	1
from	1
being	1
in	1
the	1
plight	1
it’s	1
in;	1
I	1
don’t	1
know	1
what	1
pleasure	1
one	1
can	1
find	1
in	1
lying	1
in	1
wait	1
for	1
an	1
animal	1
that	1
may	1
take	1
your	1
life	1
with	1
his	1
tusk	1
if	1
he	1
gets	1
at	1
you.	1
I	1
recollect	1
having	1
heard	1
an	1
old	1
ballad	1
sung	1
that	1
says,	1
By	1
bears	1
be	1
thou	1
devoured,	1
as	1
erst	1
Was	1
famous	1
Favila.”	1
“That,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“was	1
a	1
Gothic	1
king,	1
who,	1
going	1
a-hunting,	1
was	1
devoured	1
by	1
a	1
bear.”	1
“Just	1
so,”	1
said	1
Sancho;	1
“and	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
kings	1
and	1
princes	1
expose	1
themselves	1
to	1
such	1
dangers	1
for	1
the	1
sake	1
of	1
a	1
pleasure	1
which,	1
to	1
my	1
mind,	1
ought	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
one,	1
as	1
it	1
consists	1
in	1
killing	1
an	1
animal	1
that	1
has	1
done	1
no	1
harm	1
whatever.”	1
“Quite	1
the	1
contrary,	1
Sancho;	1
you	1
are	1
wrong	1
there,”	1
said	1
the	1
duke;	1
“for	1
hunting	1
is	1
more	1
suitable	1
and	1
requisite	1
for	1
kings	1
and	1
princes	1
than	1
for	1
anybody	1
else.	1
The	1
chase	1
is	1
the	1
emblem	1
of	1
war;	1
it	1
has	1
stratagems,	1
wiles,	1
and	1
crafty	1
devices	1
for	1
overcoming	1
the	1
enemy	1
in	1
safety;	1
in	1
it	1
extreme	1
cold	1
and	1
intolerable	1
heat	1
have	1
to	1
be	1
borne,	1
indolence	1
and	1
sleep	1
are	1
despised,	1
the	1
bodily	1
powers	1
are	1
invigorated,	1
the	1
limbs	1
of	1
him	1
who	1
engages	1
in	1
it	1
are	1
made	1
supple,	1
and,	1
in	1
a	1
word,	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
pursuit	1
which	1
may	1
be	1
followed	1
without	1
injury	1
to	1
anyone	1
and	1
with	1
enjoyment	1
to	1
many;	1
and	1
the	1
best	1
of	1
it	1
is,	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
for	1
everybody,	1
as	1
field-sports	1
of	1
other	1
sorts	1
are,	1
except	1
hawking,	1
which	1
also	1
is	1
only	1
for	1
kings	1
and	1
great	1
lords.	1
Reconsider	1
your	1
opinion	1
therefore,	1
Sancho,	1
and	1
when	1
you	1
are	1
governor	1
take	1
to	1
hunting,	1
and	1
you	1
will	1
find	1
the	1
good	1
of	1
it.”	1
“Nay,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“the	1
good	1
governor	1
should	1
have	1
a	1
broken	1
leg	1
and	1
keep	1
at	1
home;”	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
nice	1
thing	1
if,	1
after	1
people	1
had	1
been	1
at	1
the	1
trouble	1
of	1
coming	1
to	1
look	1
for	1
him	1
on	1
business,	1
the	1
governor	1
were	1
to	1
be	1
away	1
in	1
the	1
forest	1
enjoying	1
himself;	1
the	1
government	1
would	1
go	1
on	1
badly	1
in	1
that	1
fashion.	1
By	1
my	1
faith,	1
señor,	1
hunting	1
and	1
amusements	1
are	1
more	1
fit	1
for	1
idlers	1
than	1
for	1
governors;	1
what	1
I	1
intend	1
to	1
amuse	1
myself	1
with	1
is	1
playing	1
all	1
fours	1
at	1
Eastertime,	1
and	1
bowls	1
on	1
Sundays	1
and	1
holidays;	1
for	1
these	1
huntings	1
don’t	1
suit	1
my	1
condition	1
or	1
agree	1
with	1
my	1
conscience.”	1
“God	1
grant	1
it	1
may	1
turn	1
out	1
so,”	1
said	1
the	1
duke;	1
“because	1
it’s	1
a	1
long	1
step	1
from	1
saying	1
to	1
doing.”	1
“Be	1
that	1
as	1
it	1
may,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“‘pledges	1
don’t	1
distress	1
a	1
good	1
payer,’	1
and	1
‘he	1
whom	1
God	1
helps	1
does	1
better	1
than	1
he	1
who	1
gets	1
up	1
early,’	1
and	1
‘it’s	1
the	1
tripes	1
that	1
carry	1
the	1
feet	1
and	1
not	1
the	1
feet	1
the	1
tripes;’	1
I	1
mean	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
if	1
God	1
gives	1
me	1
help	1
and	1
I	1
do	1
my	1
duty	1
honestly,	1
no	1
doubt	1
I’ll	1
govern	1
better	1
than	1
a	1
gerfalcon.	1
Nay,	1
let	1
them	1
only	1
put	1
a	1
finger	1
in	1
my	1
mouth,	1
and	1
they’ll	1
see	1
whether	1
I	1
can	1
bite	1
or	1
not.”	1
“The	1
curse	1
of	1
God	1
and	1
all	1
his	1
saints	1
upon	1
thee,	1
thou	1
accursed	1
Sancho!”	1
exclaimed	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
“when	1
will	1
the	1
day	1
come—as	1
I	1
have	1
often	1
said	1
to	1
thee—when	1
I	1
shall	1
hear	1
thee	1
make	1
one	1
single	1
coherent,	1
rational	1
remark	1
without	1
proverbs?	1
Pray,	1
your	1
highnesses,	1
leave	1
this	1
fool	1
alone,	1
for	1
he	1
will	1
grind	1
your	1
souls	1
between,	1
not	1
to	1
say	1
two,	1
but	1
two	1
thousand	1
proverbs,	1
dragged	1
in	1
as	1
much	1
in	1
season,	1
and	1
as	1
much	1
to	1
the	1
purpose	1
as—may	1
God	1
grant	1
as	1
much	1
health	1
to	1
him,	1
or	1
to	1
me	1
if	1
I	1
want	1
to	1
listen	1
to	1
them!”	1
“Sancho	1
Panza’s	1
proverbs,”	1
said	1
the	1
duchess,	1
“though	1
more	1
in	1
number	1
than	1
the	1
Greek	1
Commander’s,	1
are	1
not	1
therefore	1
less	1
to	1
be	1
esteemed	1
for	1
the	1
conciseness	1
of	1
the	1
maxims.	1
For	1
my	1
own	1
part,	1
I	1
can	1
say	1
they	1
give	1
me	1
more	1
pleasure	1
than	1
others	1
that	1
may	1
be	1
better	1
brought	1
in	1
and	1
more	1
seasonably	1
introduced.”	1
In	1
pleasant	1
conversation	1
of	1
this	1
sort	1
they	1
passed	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
tent	1
into	1
the	1
wood,	1
and	1
the	1
day	1
was	1
spent	1
in	1
visiting	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
posts	1
and	1
hiding-places,	1
and	1
then	1
night	1
closed	1
in,	1
not,	1
however,	1
as	1
brilliantly	1
or	1
tranquilly	1
as	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
expected	1
at	1
the	1
season,	1
for	1
it	1
was	1
then	1
midsummer;	1
but	1
bringing	1
with	1
it	1
a	1
kind	1
of	1
haze	1
that	1
greatly	1
aided	1
the	1
project	1
of	1
the	1
duke	1
and	1
duchess;	1
and	1
thus,	1
as	1
night	1
began	1
to	1
fall,	1
and	1
a	1
little	1
after	1
twilight	1
set	1
in,	1
suddenly	1
the	1
whole	1
wood	1
on	1
all	1
four	1
sides	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
on	1
fire,	1
and	1
shortly	1
after,	1
here,	1
there,	1
on	1
all	1
sides,	1
a	1
vast	1
number	1
of	1
trumpets	1
and	1
other	1
military	1
instruments	1
were	1
heard,	1
as	1
if	1
several	1
troops	1
of	1
cavalry	1
were	1
passing	1
through	1
the	1
wood.	1
The	1
blaze	1
of	1
the	1
fire	1
and	1
the	1
noise	1
of	1
the	1
warlike	1
instruments	1
almost	1
blinded	1
the	1
eyes	1
and	1
deafened	1
the	1
ears	1
of	1
those	1
that	1
stood	1
by,	1
and	1
indeed	1
of	1
all	1
who	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
wood.	1
Then	1
there	1
were	1
heard	1
repeated	1
lelilies	1
after	1
the	1
fashion	1
of	1
the	1
Moors	1
when	1
they	1
rush	1
to	1
battle;	1
trumpets	1
and	1
clarions	1
brayed,	1
drums	1
beat,	1
fifes	1
played,	1
so	1
unceasingly	1
and	1
so	1
fast	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
had	1
any	1
senses	1
who	1
did	1
not	1
lose	1
them	1
with	1
the	1
confused	1
din	1
of	1
so	1
many	1
instruments.	1
The	1
duke	1
was	1
astounded,	1
the	1
duchess	1
amazed,	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
wondering,	1
Sancho	1
Panza	1
trembling,	1
and	1
indeed,	1
even	1
they	1
who	1
were	1
aware	1
of	1
the	1
cause	1
were	1
frightened.	1
In	1
their	1
fear,	1
silence	1
fell	1
upon	1
them,	1
and	1
a	1
postillion,	1
in	1
the	1
guise	1
of	1
a	1
demon,	1
passed	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
them,	1
blowing,	1
in	1
lieu	1
of	1
a	1
bugle,	1
a	1
huge	1
hollow	1
horn	1
that	1
gave	1
out	1
a	1
horrible	1
hoarse	1
note.	1
“Ho	1
there!	1
brother	1
courier,”	1
cried	1
the	1
duke,	1
“who	1
are	1
you?	1
Where	1
are	1
you	1
going?	1
What	1
troops	1
are	1
these	1
that	1
seem	1
to	1
be	1
passing	1
through	1
the	1
wood?”	1
To	1
which	1
the	1
courier	1
replied	1
in	1
a	1
harsh,	1
discordant	1
voice,	1
“I	1
am	1
the	1
devil;	1
I	1
am	1
in	1
search	1
of	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
of	1
La	1
Mancha;	1
those	1
who	1
are	1
coming	1
this	1
way	1
are	1
six	1
troops	1
of	1
enchanters,	1
who	1
are	1
bringing	1
on	1
a	1
triumphal	1
car	1
the	1
peerless	1
Dulcinea	1
del	1
Toboso;	1
she	1
comes	1
under	1
enchantment,	1
together	1
with	1
the	1
gallant	1
Frenchman	1
Montesinos,	1
to	1
give	1
instructions	1
to	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
as	1
to	1
how,	1
she	1
the	1
said	1
lady,	1
may	1
be	1
disenchanted.”	1
“If	1
you	1
were	1
the	1
devil,	1
as	1
you	1
say	1
and	1
as	1
your	1
appearance	1
indicates,”	1
said	1
the	1
duke,	1
“you	1
would	1
have	1
known	1
the	1
said	1
knight	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
of	1
La	1
Mancha,	1
for	1
you	1
have	1
him	1
here	1
before	1
you.”	1
“By	1
God	1
and	1
upon	1
my	1
conscience,”	1
said	1
the	1
devil,	1
“I	1
never	1
observed	1
it,	1
for	1
my	1
mind	1
is	1
occupied	1
with	1
so	1
many	1
different	1
things	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
forgetting	1
the	1
main	1
thing	1
I	1
came	1
about.”	1
“This	1
demon	1
must	1
be	1
an	1
honest	1
fellow	1
and	1
a	1
good	1
Christian,”	1
said	1
Sancho;	1
“for	1
if	1
he	1
wasn’t	1
he	1
wouldn’t	1
swear	1
by	1
God	1
and	1
his	1
conscience;	1
I	1
feel	1
sure	1
now	1
there	1
must	1
be	1
good	1
souls	1
even	1
in	1
hell	1
itself.”	1
Without	1
dismounting,	1
the	1
demon	1
then	1
turned	1
to	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
and	1
said,	1
“The	1
unfortunate	1
but	1
valiant	1
knight	1
Montesinos	1
sends	1
me	1
to	1
thee,	1
the	1
Knight	1
of	1
the	1
Lions	1
(would	1
that	1
I	1
saw	1
thee	1
in	1
their	1
claws),	1
bidding	1
me	1
tell	1
thee	1
to	1
wait	1
for	1
him	1
wherever	1
I	1
may	1
find	1
thee,	1
as	1
he	1
brings	1
with	1
him	1
her	1
whom	1
they	1
call	1
Dulcinea	1
del	1
Toboso,	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
show	1
thee	1
what	1
is	1
needful	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
disenchant	1
her;	1
and	1
as	1
I	1
came	1
for	1
no	1
more	1
I	1
need	1
stay	1
no	1
longer;	1
demons	1
of	1
my	1
sort	1
be	1
with	1
thee,	1
and	1
good	1
angels	1
with	1
these	1
gentles;”	1
and	1
so	1
saying	1
he	1
blew	1
his	1
huge	1
horn,	1
turned	1
about	1
and	1
went	1
off	1
without	1
waiting	1
for	1
a	1
reply	1
from	1
anyone.	1
They	1
all	1
felt	1
fresh	1
wonder,	1
but	1
particularly	1
Sancho	1
and	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
Sancho	1
to	1
see	1
how,	1
in	1
defiance	1
of	1
the	1
truth,	1
they	1
would	1
have	1
it	1
that	1
Dulcinea	1
was	1
enchanted;	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
because	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
feel	1
sure	1
whether	1
what	1
had	1
happened	1
to	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
cave	1
of	1
Montesinos	1
was	1
true	1
or	1
not;	1
and	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
deep	1
in	1
these	1
cogitations	1
the	1
duke	1
said	1
to	1
him,	1
“Do	1
you	1
mean	1
to	1
wait,	1
Señor	1
Don	1
Quixote?”	1
“Why	1
not?”	1
replied	1
he;	1
“here	1
will	1
I	1
wait,	1
fearless	1
and	1
firm,	1
though	1
all	1
hell	1
should	1
come	1
to	1
attack	1
me.”	1
“Well	1
then,	1
if	1
I	1
see	1
another	1
devil	1
or	1
hear	1
another	1
horn	1
like	1
the	1
last,	1
I’ll	1
wait	1
here	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
in	1
Flanders,”	1
said	1
Sancho.	1
Night	1
now	1
closed	1
in	1
more	1
completely,	1
and	1
many	1
lights	1
began	1
to	1
flit	1
through	1
the	1
wood,	1
just	1
as	1
those	1
fiery	1
exhalations	1
from	1
the	1
earth,	1
that	1
look	1
like	1
shooting-stars	1
to	1
our	1
eyes,	1
flit	1
through	1
the	1
heavens;	1
a	1
frightful	1
noise,	1
too,	1
was	1
heard,	1
like	1
that	1
made	1
by	1
the	1
solid	1
wheels	1
the	1
ox-carts	1
usually	1
have,	1
by	1
the	1
harsh,	1
ceaseless	1
creaking	1
of	1
which,	1
they	1
say,	1
the	1
bears	1
and	1
wolves	1
are	1
put	1
to	1
flight,	1
if	1
there	1
happen	1
to	1
be	1
any	1
where	1
they	1
are	1
passing.	1
In	1
addition	1
to	1
all	1
this	1
commotion,	1
there	1
came	1
a	1
further	1
disturbance	1
to	1
increase	1
the	1
tumult,	1
for	1
now	1
it	1
seemed	1
as	1
if	1
in	1
truth,	1
on	1
all	1
four	1
sides	1
of	1
the	1
wood,	1
four	1
encounters	1
or	1
battles	1
were	1
going	1
on	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time;	1
in	1
one	1
quarter	1
resounded	1
the	1
dull	1
noise	1
of	1
a	1
terrible	1
cannonade,	1
in	1
another	1
numberless	1
muskets	1
were	1
being	1
discharged,	1
the	1
shouts	1
of	1
the	1
combatants	1
sounded	1
almost	1
close	1
at	1
hand,	1
and	1
farther	1
away	1
the	1
Moorish	1
lelilies	1
were	1
raised	1
again	1
and	1
again.	1
In	1
a	1
word,	1
the	1
bugles,	1
the	1
horns,	1
the	1
clarions,	1
the	1
trumpets,	1
the	1
drums,	1
the	1
cannon,	1
the	1
musketry,	1
and	1
above	1
all	1
the	1
tremendous	1
noise	1
of	1
the	1
carts,	1
all	1
made	1
up	1
together	1
a	1
din	1
so	1
confused	1
and	1
terrific	1
that	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
had	1
need	1
to	1
summon	1
up	1
all	1
his	1
courage	1
to	1
brave	1
it;	1
but	1
Sancho’s	1
gave	1
way,	1
and	1
he	1
fell	1
fainting	1
on	1
the	1
skirt	1
of	1
the	1
duchess’s	1
robe,	1
who	1
let	1
him	1
lie	1
there	1
and	1
promptly	1
bade	1
them	1
throw	1
water	1
in	1
his	1
face.	1
This	1
was	1
done,	1
and	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
himself	1
by	1
the	1
time	1
that	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
carts	1
with	1
the	1
creaking	1
wheels	1
reached	1
the	1
spot.	1
It	1
was	1
drawn	1
by	1
four	1
plodding	1
oxen	1
all	1
covered	1
with	1
black	1
housings;	1
on	1
each	1
horn	1
they	1
had	1
fixed	1
a	1
large	1
lighted	1
wax	1
taper,	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
cart	1
was	1
constructed	1
a	1
raised	1
seat,	1
on	1
which	1
sat	1
a	1
venerable	1
old	1
man	1
with	1
a	1
beard	1
whiter	1
than	1
the	1
very	1
snow,	1
and	1
so	1
long	1
that	1
it	1
fell	1
below	1
his	1
waist;	1
he	1
was	1
dressed	1
in	1
a	1
long	1
robe	1
of	1
black	1
buckram;	1
for	1
as	1
the	1
cart	1
was	1
thickly	1
set	1
with	1
a	1
multitude	1
of	1
candles	1
it	1
was	1
easy	1
to	1
make	1
out	1
everything	1
that	1
was	1
on	1
it.	1
Leading	1
it	1
were	1
two	1
hideous	1
demons,	1
also	1
clad	1
in	1
buckram,	1
with	1
countenances	1
so	1
frightful	1
that	1
Sancho,	1
having	1
once	1
seen	1
them,	1
shut	1
his	1
eyes	1
so	1
as	1
not	1
to	1
see	1
them	1
again.	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
the	1
cart	1
came	1
opposite	1
the	1
spot	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
rose	1
from	1
his	1
lofty	1
seat,	1
and	1
standing	1
up	1
said	1
in	1
a	1
loud	1
voice,	1
“I	1
am	1
the	1
sage	1
Lirgandeo,”	1
and	1
without	1
another	1
word	1
the	1
cart	1
then	1
passed	1
on.	1
Behind	1
it	1
came	1
another	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
form,	1
with	1
another	1
aged	1
man	1
enthroned,	1
who,	1
stopping	1
the	1
cart,	1
said	1
in	1
a	1
voice	1
no	1
less	1
solemn	1
than	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
first,	1
“I	1
am	1
the	1
sage	1
Alquife,	1
the	1
great	1
friend	1
of	1
Urganda	1
the	1
Unknown,”	1
and	1
passed	1
on.	1
Then	1
another	1
cart	1
came	1
by	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
pace,	1
but	1
the	1
occupant	1
of	1
the	1
throne	1
was	1
not	1
old	1
like	1
the	1
others,	1
but	1
a	1
man	1
stalwart	1
and	1
robust,	1
and	1
of	1
a	1
forbidding	1
countenance,	1
who	1
as	1
he	1
came	1
up	1
said	1
in	1
a	1
voice	1
far	1
hoarser	1
and	1
more	1
devilish,	1
“I	1
am	1
the	1
enchanter	1
Archelaus,	1
the	1
mortal	1
enemy	1
of	1
Amadis	1
of	1
Gaul	1
and	1
all	1
his	1
kindred,”	1
and	1
then	1
passed	1
on.	1
Having	1
gone	1
a	1
short	1
distance	1
the	1
three	1
carts	1
halted	1
and	1
the	1
monotonous	1
noise	1
of	1
their	1
wheels	1
ceased,	1
and	1
soon	1
after	1
they	1
heard	1
another,	1
not	1
noise,	1
but	1
sound	1
of	1
sweet,	1
harmonious	1
music,	1
of	1
which	1
Sancho	1
was	1
very	1
glad,	1
taking	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
good	1
sign;	1
and	1
said	1
he	1
to	1
the	1
duchess,	1
from	1
whom	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
stir	1
a	1
step,	1
or	1
for	1
a	1
single	1
instant,	1
“Señora,	1
where	1
there’s	1
music	1
there	1
can’t	1
be	1
mischief.”	1
“Nor	1
where	1
there	1
are	1
lights	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
bright,”	1
said	1
the	1
duchess;	1
to	1
which	1
Sancho	1
replied,	1
“Fire	1
gives	1
light,	1
and	1
it’s	1
bright	1
where	1
there	1
are	1
bonfires,	1
as	1
we	1
see	1
by	1
those	1
that	1
are	1
all	1
round	1
us	1
and	1
perhaps	1
may	1
burn	1
us;	1
but	1
music	1
is	1
a	1
sign	1
of	1
mirth	1
and	1
merrymaking.”	1
“That	1
remains	1
to	1
be	1
seen,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
who	1
was	1
listening	1
to	1
all	1
that	1
passed;	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
right,	1
as	1
is	1
shown	1
in	1
the	1
following	1
chapter.	1

They	1
saw	1
advancing	1
towards	1
them,	1
to	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
this	1
pleasing	1
music,	1
what	1
they	1
call	1
a	1
triumphal	1
car,	1
drawn	1
by	1
six	1
grey	1
mules	1
with	1
white	1
linen	1
housings,	1
on	1
each	1
of	1
which	1
was	1
mounted	1
a	1
penitent,	1
robed	1
also	1
in	1
white,	1
with	1
a	1
large	1
lighted	1
wax	1
taper	1
in	1
his	1
hand.	1
The	1
car	1
was	1
twice	1
or,	1
perhaps,	1
three	1
times	1
as	1
large	1
as	1
the	1
former	1
ones,	1
and	1
in	1
front	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
sides	1
stood	1
twelve	1
more	1
penitents,	1
all	1
as	1
white	1
as	1
snow	1
and	1
all	1
with	1
lighted	1
tapers,	1
a	1
spectacle	1
to	1
excite	1
fear	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
wonder;	1
and	1
on	1
a	1
raised	1
throne	1
was	1
seated	1
a	1
nymph	1
draped	1
in	1
a	1
multitude	1
of	1
silver-tissue	1
veils	1
with	1
an	1
embroidery	1
of	1
countless	1
gold	1
spangles	1
glittering	1
all	1
over	1
them,	1
that	1
made	1
her	1
appear,	1
if	1
not	1
richly,	1
at	1
least	1
brilliantly,	1
apparelled.	1
She	1
had	1
her	1
face	1
covered	1
with	1
thin	1
transparent	1
sendal,	1
the	1
texture	1
of	1
which	1
did	1
not	1
prevent	1
the	1
fair	1
features	1
of	1
a	1
maiden	1
from	1
being	1
distinguished,	1
while	1
the	1
numerous	1
lights	1
made	1
it	1
possible	1
to	1
judge	1
of	1
her	1
beauty	1
and	1
of	1
her	1
years,	1
which	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
not	1
less	1
than	1
seventeen	1
but	1
not	1
to	1
have	1
yet	1
reached	1
twenty.	1
Beside	1
her	1
was	1
a	1
figure	1
in	1
a	1
robe	1
of	1
state,	1
as	1
they	1
call	1
it,	1
reaching	1
to	1
the	1
feet,	1
while	1
the	1
head	1
was	1
covered	1
with	1
a	1
black	1
veil.	1
But	1
the	1
instant	1
the	1
car	1
was	1
opposite	1
the	1
duke	1
and	1
duchess	1
and	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
the	1
music	1
of	1
the	1
clarions	1
ceased,	1
and	1
then	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
lutes	1
and	1
harps	1
on	1
the	1
car,	1
and	1
the	1
figure	1
in	1
the	1
robe	1
rose	1
up,	1
and	1
flinging	1
it	1
apart	1
and	1
removing	1
the	1
veil	1
from	1
its	1
face,	1
disclosed	1
to	1
their	1
eyes	1
the	1
shape	1
of	1
Death	1
itself,	1
fleshless	1
and	1
hideous,	1
at	1
which	1
sight	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
felt	1
uneasy,	1
Sancho	1
frightened,	1
and	1
the	1
duke	1
and	1
duchess	1
displayed	1
a	1
certain	1
trepidation.	1
Having	1
risen	1
to	1
its	1
feet,	1
this	1
living	1
death,	1
in	1
a	1
sleepy	1
voice	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
tongue	1
hardly	1
awake,	1

the	1

The	1

for	1
father,	1
and	1
the	1
lie	1
Hath	1
gathered	1
credence	1
with	1
the	1
lapse	1
of	1

Of	1
magic	1
prince,	1
of	1
Zoroastric	1

Monarch	1
and	1
treasurer,	1
with	1
jealous	1
eye	1
I	1
view	1
the	1
efforts	1
of	1
the	1
age	1
to	1
hide	1
The	1
gallant	1
deeds	1
of	1
doughty	1
errant	1
knights,	1
Who	1
are,	1
and	1
ever	1
have	1
been,	1
dear	1
to	1
me.	1
Enchanters	1
and	1
magicians	1
and	1
their	1
kind	1
Are	1
mostly	1
hard	1
of	1
heart;	1
not	1
so	1

I;	1
For	1
mine	1
is	1
tender,	1
soft,	1
compassionate,	1
And	1
its	1
delight	1
is	1
doing	1
good	1
to	1
all.	1
In	1
the	1
dim	1
caverns	1
of	1
the	1
gloomy	1
Dis,	1
Where,	1
tracing	1
mystic	1
lines	1
and	1
characters,	1
My	1
soul	1
abideth	1
now,	1
there	1
came	1
to	1
me	1
The	1
sorrow-laden	1
plaint	1
of	1
her,	1
the	1
fair,	1
The	1
peerless	1
Dulcinea	1
del	1
Toboso.	1
I	1
knew	1
of	1
her	1
enchantment	1
and	1
her	1
fate,	1
From	1
high-born	1
dame	1
to	1
peasant	1
wench	1
transformed	1
And	1
touched	1
with	1
pity,	1
first	1
I	1
turned	1
the	1
leaves	1
Of	1
countless	1
volumes	1
of	1
my	1
devilish	1
craft,	1
And	1
then,	1
in	1
this	1
grim	1
grisly	1
skeleton	1
Myself	1
encasing,	1
hither	1
have	1
I	1
come	1
To	1
show	1
where	1
lies	1
the	1
fitting	1
remedy	1
To	1
give	1
relief	1
in	1
such	1

O	1

that	1
I	1
wear	1
The	1

O	1
shining	1

O	1

polestar,	1
path	1
and	1

of	1
all	1
Who,	1
scorning	1
slumber	1
and	1

Adopt	1
the	1
toilsome	1
life	1
of	1
bloodstained	1
arms!	1
To	1
thee,	1
great	1
hero	1
who	1
all	1
praise	1
transcends,	1
La	1
Mancha’s	1
lustre	1
and	1
Iberia’s	1
star,	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
wise	1
as	1
brave,	1
to	1
thee	1
I	1
say—	1
For	1
peerless	1
Dulcinea	1
del	1
Toboso	1
Her	1
pristine	1
form	1
and	1
beauty	1
to	1
regain,	1
’Tis	1
needful	1
that	1
thy	1
esquire	1
Sancho	1
shall,	1
On	1
his	1
own	1
sturdy	1
buttocks	1
bared	1
to	1
heaven,	1
Three	1
thousand	1
and	1
three	1
hundred	1
lashes	1
lay,	1
And	1
that	1
they	1
smart	1
and	1
sting	1
and	1
hurt	1
him	1
well.	1
Thus	1
have	1
the	1
authors	1
of	1
her	1
woe	1
resolved.	1
And	1
this	1
is,	1
gentles,	1
wherefore	1
I	1
have	1
come.	1
“By	1
all	1
that’s	1
good,”	1
exclaimed	1
Sancho	1
at	1
this,	1
“I’ll	1
just	1
as	1
soon	1
give	1
myself	1
three	1
stabs	1
with	1
a	1
dagger	1
as	1
three,	1
not	1
to	1
say	1
three	1
thousand,	1
lashes.	1
The	1
devil	1
take	1
such	1
a	1
way	1
of	1
disenchanting!	1
I	1
don’t	1
see	1
what	1
my	1
backside	1
has	1
got	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
enchantments.	1
By	1
God,	1
if	1
Señor	1
Merlin	1
has	1
not	1
found	1
out	1
some	1
other	1
way	1
of	1
disenchanting	1
the	1
lady	1
Dulcinea	1
del	1
Toboso,	1
she	1
may	1
go	1
to	1
her	1
grave	1
enchanted.”	1
“But	1
I’ll	1
take	1
you,	1
Don	1
Clown	1
stuffed	1
with	1
garlic,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“and	1
tie	1
you	1
to	1
a	1
tree	1
as	1
naked	1
as	1
when	1
your	1
mother	1
brought	1
you	1
forth,	1
and	1
give	1
you,	1
not	1
to	1
say	1
three	1
thousand	1
three	1
hundred,	1
but	1
six	1
thousand	1
six	1
hundred	1
lashes,	1
and	1
so	1
well	1
laid	1
on	1
that	1
they	1
won’t	1
be	1
got	1
rid	1
of	1
if	1
you	1
try	1
three	1
thousand	1
three	1
hundred	1
times;	1
don’t	1
answer	1
me	1
a	1
word	1
or	1
I’ll	1
tear	1
your	1
soul	1
out.”	1
On	1
hearing	1
this	1
Merlin	1
said,	1
“That	1
will	1
not	1
do,	1
for	1
the	1
lashes	1
worthy	1
Sancho	1
has	1
to	1
receive	1
must	1
be	1
given	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
free	1
will	1
and	1
not	1
by	1
force,	1
and	1
at	1
whatever	1
time	1
he	1
pleases,	1
for	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
fixed	1
limit	1
assigned	1
to	1
him;	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
permitted	1
him,	1
if	1
he	1
likes	1
to	1
commute	1
by	1
half	1
the	1
pain	1
of	1
this	1
whipping,	1
to	1
let	1
them	1
be	1
given	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
another,	1
though	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
somewhat	1
weighty.”	1
“Not	1
a	1
hand,	1
my	1
own	1
or	1
anybody	1
else’s,	1
weighty	1
or	1
weighable,	1
shall	1
touch	1
me,”	1
said	1
Sancho.	1
“Was	1
it	1
I	1
that	1
gave	1
birth	1
to	1
the	1
lady	1
Dulcinea	1
del	1
Toboso,	1
that	1
my	1
backside	1
is	1
to	1
pay	1
for	1
the	1
sins	1
of	1
her	1
eyes?	1
My	1
master,	1
indeed,	1
that’s	1
a	1
part	1
of	1
her—for,	1
he’s	1
always	1
calling	1
her	1
‘my	1
life’	1
and	1
‘my	1
soul,’	1
and	1
his	1
stay	1
and	1
prop—may	1
and	1
ought	1
to	1
whip	1
himself	1
for	1
her	1
and	1
take	1
all	1
the	1
trouble	1
required	1
for	1
her	1
disenchantment.	1
But	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
whip	1
myself!	1
Abernuncio!”	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
Sancho	1
had	1
done	1
speaking	1
the	1
nymph	1
in	1
silver	1
that	1
was	1
at	1
the	1
side	1
of	1
Merlin’s	1
ghost	1
stood	1
up,	1
and	1
removing	1
the	1
thin	1
veil	1
from	1
her	1
face	1
disclosed	1
one	1
that	1
seemed	1
to	1
all	1
something	1
more	1
than	1
exceedingly	1
beautiful;	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
masculine	1
freedom	1
from	1
embarrassment	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
voice	1
not	1
very	1
like	1
a	1
lady’s,	1
addressing	1
Sancho	1
directly,	1
said,	1
“Thou	1
wretched	1
squire,	1
soul	1
of	1
a	1
pitcher,	1
heart	1
of	1
a	1
cork	1
tree,	1
with	1
bowels	1
of	1
flint	1
and	1
pebbles;	1
if,	1
thou	1
impudent	1
thief,	1
they	1
bade	1
thee	1
throw	1
thyself	1
down	1
from	1
some	1
lofty	1
tower;	1
if,	1
enemy	1
of	1
mankind,	1
they	1
asked	1
thee	1
to	1
swallow	1
a	1
dozen	1
of	1
toads,	1
two	1
of	1
lizards,	1
and	1
three	1
of	1
adders;	1
if	1
they	1
wanted	1
thee	1
to	1
slay	1
thy	1
wife	1
and	1
children	1
with	1
a	1
sharp	1
murderous	1
scimitar,	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
no	1
wonder	1
for	1
thee	1
to	1
show	1
thyself	1
stubborn	1
and	1
squeamish.	1
But	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
piece	1
of	1
work	1
about	1
three	1
thousand	1
three	1
hundred	1
lashes,	1
what	1
every	1
poor	1
little	1
charity-boy	1
gets	1
every	1
month—it	1
is	1
enough	1
to	1
amaze,	1
astonish,	1
astound	1
the	1
compassionate	1
bowels	1
of	1
all	1
who	1
hear	1
it,	1
nay,	1
all	1
who	1
come	1
to	1
hear	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
time.	1
Turn,	1
O	1
miserable,	1
hard-hearted	1
animal,	1
turn,	1
I	1
say,	1
those	1
timorous	1
owl’s	1
eyes	1
upon	1
these	1
of	1
mine	1
that	1
are	1
compared	1
to	1
radiant	1
stars,	1
and	1
thou	1
wilt	1
see	1
them	1
weeping	1
trickling	1
streams	1
and	1
rills,	1
and	1
tracing	1
furrows,	1
tracks,	1
and	1
paths	1
over	1
the	1
fair	1
fields	1
of	1
my	1
cheeks.	1
Let	1
it	1
move	1
thee,	1
crafty,	1
ill-conditioned	1
monster,	1
to	1
see	1
my	1
blooming	1
youth—still	1
in	1
its	1
teens,	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
yet	1
twenty—wasting	1
and	1
withering	1
away	1
beneath	1
the	1
husk	1
of	1
a	1
rude	1
peasant	1
wench;	1
and	1
if	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
appear	1
in	1
that	1
shape	1
now,	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
special	1
favour	1
Señor	1
Merlin	1
here	1
has	1
granted	1
me,	1
to	1
the	1
sole	1
end	1
that	1
my	1
beauty	1
may	1
soften	1
thee;	1
for	1
the	1
tears	1
of	1
beauty	1
in	1
distress	1
turn	1
rocks	1
into	1
cotton	1
and	1
tigers	1
into	1
ewes.	1
Lay	1
on	1
to	1
that	1
hide	1
of	1
thine,	1
thou	1
great	1
untamed	1
brute,	1
rouse	1
up	1
thy	1
lusty	1
vigour	1
that	1
only	1
urges	1
thee	1
to	1
eat	1
and	1
eat,	1
and	1
set	1
free	1
the	1
softness	1
of	1
my	1
flesh,	1
the	1
gentleness	1
of	1
my	1
nature,	1
and	1
the	1
fairness	1
of	1
my	1
face.	1
And	1
if	1
thou	1
wilt	1
not	1
relent	1
or	1
come	1
to	1
reason	1
for	1
me,	1
do	1
so	1
for	1
the	1
sake	1
of	1
that	1
poor	1
knight	1
thou	1
hast	1
beside	1
thee;	1
thy	1
master	1
I	1
mean,	1
whose	1
soul	1
I	1
can	1
this	1
moment	1
see,	1
how	1
he	1
has	1
it	1
stuck	1
in	1
his	1
throat	1
not	1
ten	1
fingers	1
from	1
his	1
lips,	1
and	1
only	1
waiting	1
for	1
thy	1
inflexible	1
or	1
yielding	1
reply	1
to	1
make	1
its	1
escape	1
by	1
his	1
mouth	1
or	1
go	1
back	1
again	1
into	1
his	1
stomach.”	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
on	1
hearing	1
this	1
felt	1
his	1
throat,	1
and	1
turning	1
to	1
the	1
duke	1
he	1
said,	1
“By	1
God,	1
señor,	1
Dulcinea	1
says	1
true,	1
I	1
have	1
my	1
soul	1
stuck	1
here	1
in	1
my	1
throat	1
like	1
the	1
nut	1
of	1
a	1
crossbow.”	1
“What	1
say	1
you	1
to	1
this,	1
Sancho?”	1
said	1
the	1
duchess.	1
“I	1
say,	1
señora,”	1
returned	1
Sancho,	1
“what	1
I	1
said	1
before;	1
as	1
for	1
the	1
lashes,	1
abernuncio!”	1
“Abrenuncio,	1
you	1
should	1
say,	1
Sancho,	1
and	1
not	1
as	1
you	1
do,”	1
said	1
the	1
duke.	1
“Let	1
me	1
alone,	1
your	1
highness,”	1
said	1
Sancho.	1
“I’m	1
not	1
in	1
a	1
humour	1
now	1
to	1
look	1
into	1
niceties	1
or	1
a	1
letter	1
more	1
or	1
less,	1
for	1
these	1
lashes	1
that	1
are	1
to	1
be	1
given	1
me,	1
or	1
I’m	1
to	1
give	1
myself,	1
have	1
so	1
upset	1
me,	1
that	1
I	1
don’t	1
know	1
what	1
I’m	1
saying	1
or	1
doing.	1
But	1
I’d	1
like	1
to	1
know	1
of	1
this	1
lady,	1
my	1
lady	1
Dulcinea	1
del	1
Toboso,	1
where	1
she	1
learned	1
this	1
way	1
she	1
has	1
of	1
asking	1
favours.	1
She	1
comes	1
to	1
ask	1
me	1
to	1
score	1
my	1
flesh	1
with	1
lashes,	1
and	1
she	1
calls	1
me	1
soul	1
of	1
a	1
pitcher,	1
and	1
great	1
untamed	1
brute,	1
and	1
a	1
string	1
of	1
foul	1
names	1
that	1
the	1
devil	1
is	1
welcome	1
to.	1
Is	1
my	1
flesh	1
brass?	1
or	1
is	1
it	1
anything	1
to	1
me	1
whether	1
she	1
is	1
enchanted	1
or	1
not?	1
Does	1
she	1
bring	1
with	1
her	1
a	1
basket	1
of	1
fair	1
linen,	1
shirts,	1
kerchiefs,	1
socks—not	1
that	1
I	1
wear	1
any—to	1
coax	1
me?	1
No,	1
nothing	1
but	1
one	1
piece	1
of	1
abuse	1
after	1
another,	1
though	1
she	1
knows	1
the	1
proverb	1
they	1
have	1
here	1
that	1
‘an	1
ass	1
loaded	1
with	1
gold	1
goes	1
lightly	1
up	1
a	1
mountain,’	1
and	1
that	1
‘gifts	1
break	1
rocks,’	1
and	1
‘praying	1
to	1
God	1
and	1
plying	1
the	1
hammer,’	1
and	1
that	1
‘one	1
“take”	1
is	1
better	1
than	1
two	1
“I’ll	1
give	1
thee’s.”’	1
Then	1
there’s	1
my	1
master,	1
who	1
ought	1
to	1
stroke	1
me	1
down	1
and	1
pet	1
me	1
to	1
make	1
me	1
turn	1
wool	1
and	1
carded	1
cotton;	1
he	1
says	1
if	1
he	1
gets	1
hold	1
of	1
me	1
he’ll	1
tie	1
me	1
naked	1
to	1
a	1
tree	1
and	1
double	1
the	1
tale	1
of	1
lashes	1
on	1
me.	1
These	1
tender-hearted	1
gentry	1
should	1
consider	1
that	1
it’s	1
not	1
merely	1
a	1
squire,	1
but	1
a	1
governor	1
they	1
are	1
asking	1
to	1
whip	1
himself;	1
just	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
was	1
‘drink	1
with	1
cherries.’	1
Let	1
them	1
learn,	1
plague	1
take	1
them,	1
the	1
right	1
way	1
to	1
ask,	1
and	1
beg,	1
and	1
behave	1
themselves;	1
for	1
all	1
times	1
are	1
not	1
alike,	1
nor	1
are	1
people	1
always	1
in	1
good	1
humour.	1
I’m	1
now	1
ready	1
to	1
burst	1
with	1
grief	1
at	1
seeing	1
my	1
green	1
coat	1
torn,	1
and	1
they	1
come	1
to	1
ask	1
me	1
to	1
whip	1
myself	1
of	1
my	1
own	1
free	1
will,	1
I	1
having	1
as	1
little	1
fancy	1
for	1
it	1
as	1
for	1
turning	1
cacique.”	1
“Well	1
then,	1
the	1
fact	1
is,	1
friend	1
Sancho,”	1
said	1
the	1
duke,	1
“that	1
unless	1
you	1
become	1
softer	1
than	1
a	1
ripe	1
fig,	1
you	1
shall	1
not	1
get	1
hold	1
of	1
the	1
government.	1
It	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
nice	1
thing	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
send	1
my	1
islanders	1
a	1
cruel	1
governor	1
with	1
flinty	1
bowels,	1
who	1
won’t	1
yield	1
to	1
the	1
tears	1
of	1
afflicted	1
damsels	1
or	1
to	1
the	1
prayers	1
of	1
wise,	1
magisterial,	1
ancient	1
enchanters	1
and	1
sages.	1
In	1
short,	1
Sancho,	1
either	1
you	1
must	1
be	1
whipped	1
by	1
yourself,	1
or	1
they	1
must	1
whip	1
you,	1
or	1
you	1
shan’t	1
be	1
governor.”	1
“Señor,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“won’t	1
two	1
days’	1
grace	1
be	1
given	1
me	1
in	1
which	1
to	1
consider	1
what	1
is	1
best	1
for	1
me?”	1
“No,	1
certainly	1
not,”	1
said	1
Merlin;	1
“here,	1
this	1
minute,	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
spot,	1
the	1
matter	1
must	1
be	1
settled;	1
either	1
Dulcinea	1
will	1
return	1
to	1
the	1
cave	1
of	1
Montesinos	1
and	1
to	1
her	1
former	1
condition	1
of	1
peasant	1
wench,	1
or	1
else	1
in	1
her	1
present	1
form	1
shall	1
be	1
carried	1
to	1
the	1
Elysian	1
fields,	1
where	1
she	1
will	1
remain	1
waiting	1
until	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
stripes	1
is	1
completed.”	1
“Now	1
then,	1
Sancho!”	1
said	1
the	1
duchess,	1
“show	1
courage,	1
and	1
gratitude	1
for	1
your	1
master	1
Don	1
Quixote’s	1
bread	1
that	1
you	1
have	1
eaten;	1
we	1
are	1
all	1
bound	1
to	1
oblige	1
and	1
please	1
him	1
for	1
his	1
benevolent	1
disposition	1
and	1
lofty	1
chivalry.	1
Consent	1
to	1
this	1
whipping,	1
my	1
son;	1
to	1
the	1
devil	1
with	1
the	1
devil,	1
and	1
leave	1
fear	1
to	1
milksops,	1
for	1
‘a	1
stout	1
heart	1
breaks	1
bad	1
luck,’	1
as	1
you	1
very	1
well	1
know.”	1
To	1
this	1
Sancho	1
replied	1
with	1
an	1
irrelevant	1
remark,	1
which,	1
addressing	1
Merlin,	1
he	1
made	1
to	1
him,	1
“Will	1
your	1
worship	1
tell	1
me,	1
Señor	1
Merlin—when	1
that	1
courier	1
devil	1
came	1
up	1
he	1
gave	1
my	1
master	1
a	1
message	1
from	1
Señor	1
Montesinos,	1
charging	1
him	1
to	1
wait	1
for	1
him	1
here,	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
coming	1
to	1
arrange	1
how	1
the	1
lady	1
Doña	1
Dulcinea	1
del	1
Toboso	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
disenchanted;	1
but	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
present	1
we	1
have	1
not	1
seen	1
Montesinos,	1
nor	1
anything	1
like	1
him.”	1
To	1
which	1
Merlin	1
made	1
answer,	1
“The	1
devil,	1
Sancho,	1
is	1
a	1
blockhead	1
and	1
a	1
great	1
scoundrel;	1
I	1
sent	1
him	1
to	1
look	1
for	1
your	1
master,	1
but	1
not	1
with	1
a	1
message	1
from	1
Montesinos	1
but	1
from	1
myself;	1
for	1
Montesinos	1
is	1
in	1
his	1
cave	1
expecting,	1
or	1
more	1
properly	1
speaking,	1
waiting	1
for	1
his	1
disenchantment;	1
for	1
there’s	1
the	1
tail	1
to	1
be	1
skinned	1
yet	1
for	1
him;	1
if	1
he	1
owes	1
you	1
anything,	1
or	1
you	1
have	1
any	1
business	1
to	1
transact	1
with	1
him,	1
I’ll	1
bring	1
him	1
to	1
you	1
and	1
put	1
him	1
where	1
you	1
choose;	1
but	1
for	1
the	1
present	1
make	1
up	1
your	1
mind	1
to	1
consent	1
to	1
this	1
penance,	1
and	1
believe	1
me	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
very	1
good	1
for	1
you,	1
for	1
soul	1
as	1
well	1
for	1
body—for	1
your	1
soul	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
charity	1
with	1
which	1
you	1
perform	1
it,	1
for	1
your	1
body	1
because	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
you	1
are	1
of	1
a	1
sanguine	1
habit	1
and	1
it	1
will	1
do	1
you	1
no	1
harm	1
to	1
draw	1
a	1
little	1
blood.”	1
“There	1
are	1
a	1
great	1
many	1
doctors	1
in	1
the	1
world;	1
even	1
the	1
enchanters	1
are	1
doctors,”	1
said	1
Sancho;	1
“however,	1
as	1
everybody	1
tells	1
me	1
the	1
same	1
thing—though	1
I	1
can’t	1
see	1
it	1
myself—I	1
say	1
I	1
am	1
willing	1
to	1
give	1
myself	1
the	1
three	1
thousand	1
three	1
hundred	1
lashes,	1
provided	1
I	1
am	1
to	1
lay	1
them	1
on	1
whenever	1
I	1
like,	1
without	1
any	1
fixing	1
of	1
days	1
or	1
times;	1
and	1
I’ll	1
try	1
and	1
get	1
out	1
of	1
debt	1
as	1
quickly	1
as	1
I	1
can,	1
that	1
the	1
world	1
may	1
enjoy	1
the	1
beauty	1
of	1
the	1
lady	1
Dulcinea	1
del	1
Toboso;	1
as	1
it	1
seems,	1
contrary	1
to	1
what	1
I	1
thought,	1
that	1
she	1
is	1
beautiful	1
after	1
all.	1
It	1
must	1
be	1
a	1
condition,	1
too,	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
bound	1
to	1
draw	1
blood	1
with	1
the	1
scourge,	1
and	1
that	1
if	1
any	1
of	1
the	1
lashes	1
happen	1
to	1
be	1
fly-flappers	1
they	1
are	1
to	1
count.	1
Item,	1
that,	1
in	1
case	1
I	1
should	1
make	1
any	1
mistake	1
in	1
the	1
reckoning,	1
Señor	1
Merlin,	1
as	1
he	1
knows	1
everything,	1
is	1
to	1
keep	1
count,	1
and	1
let	1
me	1
know	1
how	1
many	1
are	1
still	1
wanting	1
or	1
over	1
the	1
number.”	1
“There	1
will	1
be	1
no	1
need	1
to	1
let	1
you	1
know	1
of	1
any	1
over,”	1
said	1
Merlin,	1
“because,	1
when	1
you	1
reach	1
the	1
full	1
number,	1
the	1
lady	1
Dulcinea	1
will	1
at	1
once,	1
and	1
that	1
very	1
instant,	1
be	1
disenchanted,	1
and	1
will	1
come	1
in	1
her	1
gratitude	1
to	1
seek	1
out	1
the	1
worthy	1
Sancho,	1
and	1
thank	1
him,	1
and	1
even	1
reward	1
him	1
for	1
the	1
good	1
work.	1
So	1
you	1
have	1
no	1
cause	1
to	1
be	1
uneasy	1
about	1
stripes	1
too	1
many	1
or	1
too	1
few;	1
heaven	1
forbid	1
I	1
should	1
cheat	1
anyone	1
of	1
even	1
a	1
hair	1
of	1
his	1
head.”	1
“Well	1
then,	1
in	1
God’s	1
hands	1
be	1
it,”	1
said	1
Sancho;	1
“in	1
the	1
hard	1
case	1
I’m	1
in	1
I	1
give	1
in;	1
I	1
say	1
I	1
accept	1
the	1
penance	1
on	1
the	1
conditions	1
laid	1
down.”	1
The	1
instant	1
Sancho	1
uttered	1
these	1
last	1
words	1
the	1
music	1
of	1
the	1
clarions	1
struck	1
up	1
once	1
more,	1
and	1
again	1
a	1
host	1
of	1
muskets	1
were	1
discharged,	1
and	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
hung	1
on	1
Sancho’s	1
neck	1
kissing	1
him	1
again	1
and	1
again	1
on	1
the	1
forehead	1
and	1
cheeks.	1
The	1
duchess	1
and	1
the	1
duke	1
expressed	1
the	1
greatest	1
satisfaction,	1
the	1
car	1
began	1
to	1
move	1
on,	1
and	1
as	1
it	1
passed	1
the	1
fair	1
Dulcinea	1
bowed	1
to	1
the	1
duke	1
and	1
duchess	1
and	1
made	1
a	1
low	1
curtsey	1
to	1
Sancho.	1

apace;	1
the	1
flowers	1
of	1
the	1
field,	1
revived,	1
raised	1
up	1
their	1
heads,	1
and	1
the	1
crystal	1
waters	1
of	1
the	1
brooks,	1
murmuring	1
over	1
the	1
grey	1
and	1
white	1
pebbles,	1
hastened	1
to	1
pay	1
their	1
tribute	1
to	1
the	1
expectant	1
rivers;	1
the	1
glad	1
earth,	1
the	1
unclouded	1
sky,	1
the	1
fresh	1
breeze,	1
the	1
clear	1
light,	1
each	1
and	1
all	1
showed	1
that	1
the	1
day	1
that	1
came	1
treading	1
on	1
the	1
skirts	1
of	1
morning	1
would	1
be	1
calm	1
and	1
bright.	1
The	1
duke	1
and	1
duchess,	1
pleased	1
with	1
their	1
hunt	1
and	1
at	1
having	1
carried	1
out	1
their	1
plans	1
so	1
cleverly	1
and	1
successfully,	1
returned	1
to	1
their	1
castle	1
resolved	1
to	1
follow	1
up	1
their	1
joke;	1
for	1
to	1
them	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
reality	1
that	1
could	1
afford	1
them	1
more	1
amusement.	1

The	1
duke	1
had	1
a	1
majordomo	1
of	1
a	1
very	1
facetious	1
and	1
sportive	1
turn,	1
and	1
he	1
it	1
was	1
that	1
played	1
the	1
part	1
of	1
Merlin,	1
made	1
all	1
the	1
arrangements	1
for	1
the	1
late	1
adventure,	1
composed	1
the	1
verses,	1
and	1
got	1
a	1
page	1
to	1
represent	1
Dulcinea;	1
and	1
now,	1
with	1
the	1
assistance	1
of	1
his	1
master	1
and	1
mistress,	1
he	1
got	1
up	1
another	1
of	1
the	1
drollest	1
and	1
strangest	1
contrivances	1
that	1
can	1
be	1
imagined.	1
The	1
duchess	1
asked	1
Sancho	1
the	1
next	1
day	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
made	1
a	1
beginning	1
with	1
his	1
penance	1
task	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
perform	1
for	1
the	1
disenchantment	1
of	1
Dulcinea.	1
He	1
said	1
he	1
had,	1
and	1
had	1
given	1
himself	1
five	1
lashes	1
overnight.	1
The	1
duchess	1
asked	1
him	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
given	1
them	1
with.	1
He	1
said	1
with	1
his	1
hand.	1
“That,”	1
said	1
the	1
duchess,	1
“is	1
more	1
like	1
giving	1
oneself	1
slaps	1
than	1
lashes;	1
I	1
am	1
sure	1
the	1
sage	1
Merlin	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
satisfied	1
with	1
such	1
tenderness;	1
worthy	1
Sancho	1
must	1
make	1
a	1
scourge	1
with	1
claws,	1
or	1
a	1
cat-o’-nine	1
tails,	1
that	1
will	1
make	1
itself	1
felt;	1
for	1
it’s	1
with	1
blood	1
that	1
letters	1
enter,	1
and	1
the	1
release	1
of	1
so	1
great	1
a	1
lady	1
as	1
Dulcinea	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
granted	1
so	1
cheaply,	1
or	1
at	1
such	1
a	1
paltry	1
price;	1
and	1
remember,	1
Sancho,	1
that	1
works	1
of	1
charity	1
done	1
in	1
a	1
lukewarm	1
and	1
half-hearted	1
way	1
are	1
without	1
merit	1
and	1
of	1
no	1
avail.”	1
To	1
which	1
Sancho	1
replied,	1
“If	1
your	1
ladyship	1
will	1
give	1
me	1
a	1
proper	1
scourge	1
or	1
cord,	1
I’ll	1
lay	1
on	1
with	1
it,	1
provided	1
it	1
does	1
not	1
hurt	1
too	1
much;	1
for	1
you	1
must	1
know,	1
boor	1
as	1
I	1
am,	1
my	1
flesh	1
is	1
more	1
cotton	1
than	1
hemp,	1
and	1
it	1
won’t	1
do	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
destroy	1
myself	1
for	1
the	1
good	1
of	1
anybody	1
else.”	1
“So	1
be	1
it	1
by	1
all	1
means,”	1
said	1
the	1
duchess;	1
“to-morrow	1
I’ll	1
give	1
you	1
a	1
scourge	1
that	1
will	1
be	1
just	1
the	1
thing	1
for	1
you,	1
and	1
will	1
accommodate	1
itself	1
to	1
the	1
tenderness	1
of	1
your	1
flesh,	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
was	1
its	1
own	1
sister.”	1
Then	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“Your	1
highness	1
must	1
know,	1
dear	1
lady	1
of	1
my	1
soul,	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
a	1
letter	1
written	1
to	1
my	1
wife,	1
Teresa	1
Panza,	1
giving	1
her	1
an	1
account	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
has	1
happened	1
me	1
since	1
I	1
left	1
her;	1
I	1
have	1
it	1
here	1
in	1
my	1
bosom,	1
and	1
there’s	1
nothing	1
wanting	1
but	1
to	1
put	1
the	1
address	1
to	1
it;	1
I’d	1
be	1
glad	1
if	1
your	1
discretion	1
would	1
read	1
it,	1
for	1
I	1
think	1
it	1
runs	1
in	1
the	1
governor	1
style;	1
I	1
mean	1
the	1
way	1
governors	1
ought	1
to	1
write.”	1
“And	1
who	1
dictated	1
it?”	1
asked	1
the	1
duchess.	1
“Who	1
should	1
have	1
dictated	1
but	1
myself,	1
sinner	1
as	1
I	1
am?”	1
said	1
Sancho.	1
“And	1
did	1
you	1
write	1
it	1
yourself?”	1
said	1
the	1
duchess.	1
“That	1
I	1
didn’t,”	1
said	1
Sancho;	1
“for	1
I	1
can	1
neither	1
read	1
nor	1
write,	1
though	1
I	1
can	1
sign	1
my	1
name.”	1
“Let	1
us	1
see	1
it,”	1
said	1
the	1
duchess,	1
“for	1
never	1
fear	1
but	1
you	1
display	1
in	1
it	1
the	1
quality	1
and	1
quantity	1
of	1
your	1
wit.”	1
Sancho	1
drew	1
out	1
an	1
open	1
letter	1
from	1
his	1
bosom,	1
and	1
the	1
duchess,	1
taking	1
it,	1
found	1
it	1
ran	1
in	1
this	1
fashion:	1
SANCHO	1
PANZA’S	1
LETTER	1
TO	1
HIS	1
WIFE,	1
TERESA	1
PANZA	1
If	1
I	1
was	1
well	1
whipped	1
I	1
went	1
mounted	1
like	1
a	1
gentleman;	1
if	1
I	1
have	1
got	1
a	1
good	1
government	1
it	1
is	1
at	1
the	1
cost	1
of	1
a	1
good	1
whipping.	1
Thou	1
wilt	1
not	1
understand	1
this	1
just	1
now,	1
my	1
Teresa;	1
by-and-by	1
thou	1
wilt	1
know	1
what	1
it	1
means.	1
I	1
may	1
tell	1
thee,	1
Teresa,	1
I	1
mean	1
thee	1
to	1
go	1
in	1
a	1
coach,	1
for	1
that	1
is	1
a	1
matter	1
of	1
importance,	1
because	1
every	1
other	1
way	1
of	1
going	1
is	1
going	1
on	1
all-fours.	1
Thou	1
art	1
a	1
governor’s	1
wife;	1
take	1
care	1
that	1
nobody	1
speaks	1
evil	1
of	1
thee	1
behind	1
thy	1
back.	1
I	1
send	1
thee	1
here	1
a	1
green	1
hunting	1
suit	1
that	1
my	1
lady	1
the	1
duchess	1
gave	1
me;	1
alter	1
it	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
petticoat	1
and	1
bodice	1
for	1
our	1
daughter.	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
my	1
master,	1
if	1
I	1
am	1
to	1
believe	1
what	1
I	1
hear	1
in	1
these	1
parts,	1
is	1
a	1
madman	1
of	1
some	1
sense,	1
and	1
a	1
droll	1
blockhead,	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
in	1
no	1
way	1
behind	1
him.	1
We	1
have	1
been	1
in	1
the	1
cave	1
of	1
Montesinos,	1
and	1
the	1
sage	1
Merlin	1
has	1
laid	1
hold	1
of	1
me	1
for	1
the	1
disenchantment	1
of	1
Dulcinea	1
del	1
Toboso,	1
her	1
that	1
is	1
called	1
Aldonza	1
Lorenzo	1
over	1
there.	1
With	1
three	1
thousand	1
three	1
hundred	1
lashes,	1
less	1
five,	1
that	1
I’m	1
to	1
give	1
myself,	1
she	1
will	1
be	1
left	1
as	1
entirely	1
disenchanted	1
as	1
the	1
mother	1
that	1
bore	1
her.	1
Say	1
nothing	1
of	1
this	1
to	1
anyone;	1
for,	1
make	1
thy	1
affairs	1
public,	1
and	1
some	1
will	1
say	1
they	1
are	1
white	1
and	1
others	1
will	1
say	1
they	1
are	1
black.	1
I	1
shall	1
leave	1
this	1
in	1
a	1
few	1
days	1
for	1
my	1
government,	1
to	1
which	1
I	1
am	1
going	1
with	1
a	1
mighty	1
great	1
desire	1
to	1
make	1
money,	1
for	1
they	1
tell	1
me	1
all	1
new	1
governors	1
set	1
out	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
desire;	1
I	1
will	1
feel	1
the	1
pulse	1
of	1
it	1
and	1
will	1
let	1
thee	1
know	1
if	1
thou	1
art	1
to	1
come	1
and	1
live	1
with	1
me	1
or	1
not.	1
Dapple	1
is	1
well	1
and	1
sends	1
many	1
remembrances	1
to	1
thee;	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
going	1
to	1
leave	1
him	1
behind	1
though	1
they	1
took	1
me	1
away	1
to	1
be	1
Grand	1
Turk.	1
My	1
lady	1
the	1
duchess	1
kisses	1
thy	1
hands	1
a	1
thousand	1
times;	1
do	1
thou	1
make	1
a	1
return	1
with	1
two	1
thousand,	1
for	1
as	1
my	1
master	1
says,	1
nothing	1
costs	1
less	1
or	1
is	1
cheaper	1
than	1
civility.	1
God	1
has	1
not	1
been	1
pleased	1
to	1
provide	1
another	1
valise	1
for	1
me	1
with	1
another	1
hundred	1
crowns,	1
like	1
the	1
one	1
the	1
other	1
day;	1
but	1
never	1
mind,	1
my	1
Teresa,	1
the	1
bell-ringer	1
is	1
in	1
safe	1
quarters,	1
and	1
all	1
will	1
come	1
out	1
in	1
the	1
scouring	1
of	1
the	1
government;	1
only	1
it	1
troubles	1
me	1
greatly	1
what	1
they	1
tell	1
me—that	1
once	1
I	1
have	1
tasted	1
it	1
I	1
will	1
eat	1
my	1
hands	1
off	1
after	1
it;	1
and	1
if	1
that	1
is	1
so	1
it	1
will	1
not	1
come	1
very	1
cheap	1
to	1
me;	1
though	1
to	1
be	1
sure	1
the	1
maimed	1
have	1
a	1
benefice	1
of	1
their	1
own	1
in	1
the	1
alms	1
they	1
beg	1
for;	1
so	1
that	1
one	1
way	1
or	1
another	1
thou	1
wilt	1
be	1
rich	1
and	1
in	1
luck.	1
God	1
give	1
it	1
to	1
thee	1
as	1
he	1
can,	1
and	1
keep	1
me	1
to	1
serve	1
thee.	1
From	1
this	1
castle,	1
the	1
20th	1
of	1
July,	1
1614.	1
Thy	1
husband,	1
the	1
governor,	1
SANCHO	1
PANZA	1
When	1
she	1
had	1
done	1
reading	1
the	1
letter	1
the	1
duchess	1
said	1
to	1
Sancho,	1
“On	1
two	1
points	1
the	1
worthy	1
governor	1
goes	1
rather	1
astray;	1
one	1
is	1
in	1
saying	1
or	1
hinting	1
that	1
this	1
government	1
has	1
been	1
bestowed	1
upon	1
him	1
for	1
the	1
lashes	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
to	1
give	1
himself,	1
when	1
he	1
knows	1
(and	1
he	1
cannot	1
deny	1
it)	1
that	1
when	1
my	1
lord	1
the	1
duke	1
promised	1
it	1
to	1
him	1
nobody	1
ever	1
dreamt	1
of	1
such	1
a	1
thing	1
as	1
lashes;	1
the	1
other	1
is	1
that	1
he	1
shows	1
himself	1
here	1
to	1
be	1
very	1
covetous;	1
and	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
him	1
a	1
money-seeker,	1
for	1
‘covetousness	1
bursts	1
the	1
bag,’	1
and	1
the	1
covetous	1
governor	1
does	1
ungoverned	1
justice.”	1
“I	1
don’t	1
mean	1
it	1
that	1
way,	1
señora,”	1
said	1
Sancho;	1
“and	1
if	1
you	1
think	1
the	1
letter	1
doesn’t	1
run	1
as	1
it	1
ought	1
to	1
do,	1
it’s	1
only	1
to	1
tear	1
it	1
up	1
and	1
make	1
another;	1
and	1
maybe	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
a	1
worse	1
one	1
if	1
it	1
is	1
left	1
to	1
my	1
gumption.”	1
“No,	1
no,”	1
said	1
the	1
duchess,	1
“this	1
one	1
will	1
do,	1
and	1
I	1
wish	1
the	1
duke	1
to	1
see	1
it.”	1
With	1
this	1
they	1
betook	1
themselves	1
to	1
a	1
garden	1
where	1
they	1
were	1
to	1
dine,	1
and	1
the	1
duchess	1
showed	1
Sancho’s	1
letter	1
to	1
the	1
duke,	1
who	1
was	1
highly	1
delighted	1
with	1
it.	1
They	1
dined,	1
and	1
after	1
the	1
cloth	1
had	1
been	1
removed	1
and	1
they	1
had	1
amused	1
themselves	1
for	1
a	1
while	1
with	1
Sancho’s	1
rich	1
conversation,	1
the	1
melancholy	1
sound	1
of	1
a	1
fife	1
and	1
harsh	1
discordant	1
drum	1
made	1
itself	1
heard.	1
All	1
seemed	1
somewhat	1
put	1
out	1
by	1
this	1
dull,	1
confused,	1
martial	1
harmony,	1
especially	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
who	1
could	1
not	1
keep	1
his	1
seat	1
from	1
pure	1
disquietude;	1
as	1
to	1
Sancho,	1
it	1
is	1
needless	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
fear	1
drove	1
him	1
to	1
his	1
usual	1
refuge,	1
the	1
side	1
or	1
the	1
skirts	1
of	1
the	1
duchess;	1
and	1
indeed	1
and	1
in	1
truth	1
the	1
sound	1
they	1
heard	1
was	1
a	1
most	1
doleful	1
and	1
melancholy	1
one.	1
While	1
they	1
were	1
still	1
in	1
uncertainty	1
they	1
saw	1
advancing	1
towards	1
them	1
through	1
the	1
garden	1
two	1
men	1
clad	1
in	1
mourning	1
robes	1
so	1
long	1
and	1
flowing	1
that	1
they	1
trailed	1
upon	1
the	1
ground.	1
As	1
they	1
marched	1
they	1
beat	1
two	1
great	1
drums	1
which	1
were	1
likewise	1
draped	1
in	1
black,	1
and	1
beside	1
them	1
came	1
the	1
fife	1
player,	1
black	1
and	1
sombre	1
like	1
the	1
others.	1
Following	1
these	1
came	1
a	1
personage	1
of	1
gigantic	1
stature	1
enveloped	1
rather	1
than	1
clad	1
in	1
a	1
gown	1
of	1
the	1
deepest	1
black,	1
the	1
skirt	1
of	1
which	1
was	1
of	1
prodigious	1
dimensions.	1
Over	1
the	1
gown,	1
girdling	1
or	1
crossing	1
his	1
figure,	1
he	1
had	1
a	1
broad	1
baldric	1
which	1
was	1
also	1
black,	1
and	1
from	1
which	1
hung	1
a	1
huge	1
scimitar	1
with	1
a	1
black	1
scabbard	1
and	1
furniture.	1
He	1
had	1
his	1
face	1
covered	1
with	1
a	1
transparent	1
black	1
veil,	1
through	1
which	1
might	1
be	1
descried	1
a	1
very	1
long	1
beard	1
as	1
white	1
as	1
snow.	1
He	1
came	1
on	1
keeping	1
step	1
to	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
the	1
drums	1
with	1
great	1
gravity	1
and	1
dignity;	1
and,	1
in	1
short,	1
his	1
stature,	1
his	1
gait,	1
the	1
sombreness	1
of	1
his	1
appearance	1
and	1
his	1
following	1
might	1
well	1
have	1
struck	1
with	1
astonishment,	1
as	1
they	1
did,	1
all	1
who	1
beheld	1
him	1
without	1
knowing	1
who	1
he	1
was.	1
With	1
this	1
measured	1
pace	1
and	1
in	1
this	1
guise	1
he	1
advanced	1
to	1
kneel	1
before	1
the	1
duke,	1
who,	1
with	1
the	1
others,	1
awaited	1
him	1
standing.	1
The	1
duke,	1
however,	1
would	1
not	1
on	1
any	1
account	1
allow	1
him	1
to	1
speak	1
until	1
he	1
had	1
risen.	1
The	1
prodigious	1
scarecrow	1
obeyed,	1
and	1
standing	1
up,	1
removed	1
the	1
veil	1
from	1
his	1
face	1
and	1
disclosed	1
the	1
most	1
enormous,	1
the	1
longest,	1
the	1
whitest	1
and	1
the	1
thickest	1
beard	1
that	1
human	1
eyes	1
had	1
ever	1
beheld	1
until	1
that	1
moment,	1
and	1
then	1
fetching	1
up	1
a	1
grave,	1
sonorous	1
voice	1
from	1
the	1
depths	1
of	1
his	1
broad,	1
capacious	1
chest,	1
and	1
fixing	1
his	1
eyes	1
on	1
the	1
duke,	1
he	1
said:	1
“Most	1
high	1
and	1
mighty	1
señor,	1
my	1
name	1
is	1
Trifaldin	1
of	1
the	1
White	1
Beard;	1
I	1
am	1
squire	1
to	1
the	1
Countess	1
Trifaldi,	1
otherwise	1
called	1
the	1
Distressed	1
Duenna,	1
on	1
whose	1
behalf	1
I	1
bear	1
a	1
message	1
to	1
your	1
highness,	1
which	1
is	1
that	1
your	1
magnificence	1
will	1
be	1
pleased	1
to	1
grant	1
her	1
leave	1
and	1
permission	1
to	1
come	1
and	1
tell	1
you	1
her	1
trouble,	1
which	1
is	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
strangest	1
and	1
most	1
wonderful	1
that	1
the	1
mind	1
most	1
familiar	1
with	1
trouble	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
could	1
have	1
imagined;	1
but	1
first	1
she	1
desires	1
to	1
know	1
if	1
the	1
valiant	1
and	1
never	1
vanquished	1
knight,	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
of	1
La	1
Mancha,	1
is	1
in	1
this	1
your	1
castle,	1
for	1
she	1
has	1
come	1
in	1
quest	1
of	1
him	1
on	1
foot	1
and	1
without	1
breaking	1
her	1
fast	1
from	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
Kandy	1
to	1
your	1
realms	1
here;	1
a	1
thing	1
which	1
may	1
and	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
regarded	1
as	1
a	1
miracle	1
or	1
set	1
down	1
to	1
enchantment;	1
she	1
is	1
even	1
now	1
at	1
the	1
gate	1
of	1
this	1
fortress	1
or	1
plaisance,	1
and	1
only	1
waits	1
for	1
your	1
permission	1
to	1
enter.	1
I	1
have	1
spoken.”	1
And	1
with	1
that	1
he	1
coughed,	1
and	1
stroked	1
down	1
his	1
beard	1
with	1
both	1
his	1
hands,	1
and	1
stood	1
very	1
tranquilly	1
waiting	1
for	1
the	1
response	1
of	1
the	1
duke,	1
which	1
was	1
to	1
this	1
effect:	1
“Many	1
days	1
ago,	1
worthy	1
squire	1
Trifaldin	1
of	1
the	1
White	1
Beard,	1
we	1
heard	1
of	1
the	1
misfortune	1
of	1
my	1
lady	1
the	1
Countess	1
Trifaldi,	1
whom	1
the	1
enchanters	1
have	1
caused	1
to	1
be	1
called	1
the	1
Distressed	1
Duenna.	1
Bid	1
her	1
enter,	1
O	1
stupendous	1
squire,	1
and	1
tell	1
her	1
that	1
the	1
valiant	1
knight	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
of	1
La	1
Mancha	1
is	1
here,	1
and	1
from	1
his	1
generous	1
disposition	1
she	1
may	1
safely	1
promise	1
herself	1
every	1
protection	1
and	1
assistance;	1
and	1
you	1
may	1
tell	1
her,	1
too,	1
that	1
if	1
my	1
aid	1
be	1
necessary	1
it	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
withheld,	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
bound	1
to	1
give	1
it	1
to	1
her	1
by	1
my	1
quality	1
of	1
knight,	1
which	1
involves	1
the	1
protection	1
of	1
women	1
of	1
all	1
sorts,	1
especially	1
widowed,	1
wronged,	1
and	1
distressed	1
dames,	1
such	1
as	1
her	1
ladyship	1
seems	1
to	1
be.”	1
On	1
hearing	1
this	1
Trifaldin	1
bent	1
the	1
knee	1
to	1
the	1
ground,	1
and	1
making	1
a	1
sign	1
to	1
the	1
fifer	1
and	1
drummers	1
to	1
strike	1
up,	1
he	1
turned	1
and	1
marched	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
garden	1
to	1
the	1
same	1
notes	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
pace	1
as	1
when	1
he	1
entered,	1
leaving	1
them	1
all	1
amazed	1
at	1
his	1
bearing	1
and	1
solemnity.	1
Turning	1
to	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
the	1
duke	1
said,	1
“After	1
all,	1
renowned	1
knight,	1
the	1
mists	1
of	1
malice	1
and	1
ignorance	1
are	1
unable	1
to	1
hide	1
or	1
obscure	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
valour	1
and	1
virtue.	1
I	1
say	1
so,	1
because	1
your	1
excellence	1
has	1
been	1
barely	1
six	1
days	1
in	1
this	1
castle,	1
and	1
already	1
the	1
unhappy	1
and	1
the	1
afflicted	1
come	1
in	1
quest	1
of	1
you	1
from	1
lands	1
far	1
distant	1
and	1
remote,	1
and	1
not	1
in	1
coaches	1
or	1
on	1
dromedaries,	1
but	1
on	1
foot	1
and	1
fasting,	1
confident	1
that	1
in	1
that	1
mighty	1
arm	1
they	1
will	1
find	1
a	1
cure	1
for	1
their	1
sorrows	1
and	1
troubles;	1
thanks	1
to	1
your	1
great	1
achievements,	1
which	1
are	1
circulated	1
all	1
over	1
the	1
known	1
earth.”	1
“I	1
wish,	1
señor	1
duke,”	1
replied	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“that	1
blessed	1
ecclesiastic,	1
who	1
at	1
table	1
the	1
other	1
day	1
showed	1
such	1
ill-will	1
and	1
bitter	1
spite	1
against	1
knights-errant,	1
were	1
here	1
now	1
to	1
see	1
with	1
his	1
own	1
eyes	1
whether	1
knights	1
of	1
the	1
sort	1
are	1
needed	1
in	1
the	1
world;	1
he	1
would	1
at	1
any	1
rate	1
learn	1
by	1
experience	1
that	1
those	1
suffering	1
any	1
extraordinary	1
affliction	1
or	1
sorrow,	1
in	1
extreme	1
cases	1
and	1
unusual	1
misfortunes	1
do	1
not	1
go	1
to	1
look	1
for	1
a	1
remedy	1
to	1
the	1
houses	1
of	1
jurists	1
or	1
village	1
sacristans,	1
or	1
to	1
the	1
knight	1
who	1
has	1
never	1
attempted	1
to	1
pass	1
the	1
bounds	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
town,	1
or	1
to	1
the	1
indolent	1
courtier	1
who	1
only	1
seeks	1
for	1
news	1
to	1
repeat	1
and	1
talk	1
of,	1
instead	1
of	1
striving	1
to	1
do	1
deeds	1
and	1
exploits	1
for	1
others	1
to	1
relate	1
and	1
record.	1
Relief	1
in	1
distress,	1
help	1
in	1
need,	1
protection	1
for	1
damsels,	1
consolation	1
for	1
widows,	1
are	1
to	1
be	1
found	1
in	1
no	1
sort	1
of	1
persons	1
better	1
than	1
in	1
knights-errant;	1
and	1
I	1
give	1
unceasing	1
thanks	1
to	1
heaven	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
one,	1
and	1
regard	1
any	1
misfortune	1
or	1
suffering	1
that	1
may	1
befall	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
pursuit	1
of	1
so	1
honourable	1
a	1
calling	1
as	1
endured	1
to	1
good	1
purpose.	1
Let	1
this	1
duenna	1
come	1
and	1
ask	1
what	1
she	1
will,	1
for	1
I	1
will	1
effect	1
her	1
relief	1
by	1
the	1
might	1
of	1
my	1
arm	1
and	1
the	1
dauntless	1
resolution	1
of	1
my	1
bold	1
heart.”	1

WHEREIN	1
IS	1
CONTINUED	1
THE	1
NOTABLE	1
ADVENTURE	1
OF	1
THE	1
DISTRESSED	1
DUENNA	1
p37a.jpg	1
(94K)	1
Full	1
Size	1
The	1
duke	1
and	1
duchess	1
were	1
extremely	1
glad	1
to	1
see	1
how	1
readily	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
fell	1
in	1
with	1
their	1
scheme;	1
but	1
at	1
this	1
moment	1
Sancho	1
observed,	1
“I	1
hope	1
this	1
señora	1
duenna	1
won’t	1
be	1
putting	1
any	1
difficulties	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
the	1
promise	1
of	1
my	1
government;	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
heard	1
a	1
Toledo	1
apothecary,	1
who	1
talked	1
like	1
a	1
goldfinch,	1
say	1
that	1
where	1
duennas	1
were	1
mixed	1
up	1
nothing	1
good	1
could	1
happen.	1
God	1
bless	1
me,	1
how	1
he	1
hated	1
them,	1
that	1
same	1
apothecary!	1
And	1
so	1
what	1
I’m	1
thinking	1
is,	1
if	1
all	1
duennas,	1
of	1
whatever	1
sort	1
or	1
condition	1
they	1
may	1
be,	1
are	1
plagues	1
and	1
busybodies,	1
what	1
must	1
they	1
be	1
that	1
are	1
distressed,	1
like	1
this	1
Countess	1
Three-skirts	1
or	1
Three-tails!—for	1
in	1
my	1
country	1
skirts	1
or	1
tails,	1
tails	1
or	1
skirts,	1
it’s	1
all	1
one.”	1
“Hush,	1
friend	1
Sancho,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
“since	1
this	1
lady	1
duenna	1
comes	1
in	1
quest	1
of	1
me	1
from	1
such	1
a	1
distant	1
land	1
she	1
cannot	1
be	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
the	1
apothecary	1
meant;	1
moreover	1
this	1
is	1
a	1
countess,	1
and	1
when	1
countesses	1
serve	1
as	1
duennas	1
it	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
service	1
of	1
queens	1
and	1
empresses,	1
for	1
in	1
their	1
own	1
houses	1
they	1
are	1
mistresses	1
paramount	1
and	1
have	1
other	1
duennas	1
to	1
wait	1
on	1
them.”	1
To	1
this	1
Doña	1
Rodriguez,	1
who	1
was	1
present,	1
made	1
answer,	1
“My	1
lady	1
the	1
duchess	1
has	1
duennas	1
in	1
her	1
service	1
that	1
might	1
be	1
countesses	1
if	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
will	1
of	1
fortune;	1
‘but	1
laws	1
go	1
as	1
kings	1
like;’	1
let	1
nobody	1
speak	1
ill	1
of	1
duennas,	1
above	1
all	1
of	1
ancient	1
maiden	1
ones;	1
for	1
though	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
one	1
myself,	1
I	1
know	1
and	1
am	1
aware	1
of	1
the	1
advantage	1
a	1
maiden	1
duenna	1
has	1
over	1
one	1
that	1
is	1
a	1
widow;	1
but	1
‘he	1
who	1
clipped	1
us	1
has	1
kept	1
the	1
scissors.’”	1
“For	1
all	1
that,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“there’s	1
so	1
much	1
to	1
be	1
clipped	1
about	1
duennas,	1
so	1
my	1
barber	1
said,	1
that	1
‘it	1
will	1
be	1
better	1
not	1
to	1
stir	1
the	1
rice	1
even	1
though	1
it	1
sticks.’”	1
“These	1
squires,”	1
returned	1
Doña	1
Rodriguez,	1
“are	1
always	1
our	1
enemies;	1
and	1
as	1
they	1
are	1
the	1
haunting	1
spirits	1
of	1
the	1
antechambers	1
and	1
watch	1
us	1
at	1
every	1
step,	1
whenever	1
they	1
are	1
not	1
saying	1
their	1
prayers	1
(and	1
that’s	1
often	1
enough)	1
they	1
spend	1
their	1
time	1
in	1
tattling	1
about	1
us,	1
digging	1
up	1
our	1
bones	1
and	1
burying	1
our	1
good	1
name.	1
But	1
I	1
can	1
tell	1
these	1
walking	1
blocks	1
that	1
we	1
will	1
live	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
them,	1
and	1
in	1
great	1
houses	1
too,	1
though	1
we	1
die	1
of	1
hunger	1
and	1
cover	1
our	1
flesh,	1
be	1
it	1
delicate	1
or	1
not,	1
with	1
widow’s	1
weeds,	1
as	1
one	1
covers	1
or	1
hides	1
a	1
dunghill	1
on	1
a	1
procession	1
day.	1
By	1
my	1
faith,	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
permitted	1
me	1
and	1
time	1
allowed,	1
I	1
could	1
prove,	1
not	1
only	1
to	1
those	1
here	1
present,	1
but	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
world,	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
virtue	1
that	1
is	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
found	1
in	1
a	1
duenna.”	1
“I	1
have	1
no	1
doubt,”	1
said	1
the	1
duchess,	1
“that	1
my	1
good	1
Doña	1
Rodriguez	1
is	1
right,	1
and	1
very	1
much	1
so;	1
but	1
she	1
had	1
better	1
bide	1
her	1
time	1
for	1
fighting	1
her	1
own	1
battle	1
and	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
duennas,	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
crush	1
the	1
calumny	1
of	1
that	1
vile	1
apothecary,	1
and	1
root	1
out	1
the	1
prejudice	1
in	1
the	1
great	1
Sancho	1
Panza’s	1
mind.”	1
To	1
which	1
Sancho	1
replied,	1
“Ever	1
since	1
I	1
have	1
sniffed	1
the	1
governorship	1
I	1
have	1
got	1
rid	1
of	1
the	1
humours	1
of	1
a	1
squire,	1
and	1
I	1
don’t	1
care	1
a	1
wild	1
fig	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
duennas	1
in	1
the	1
world.”	1
They	1
would	1
have	1
carried	1
on	1
this	1
duenna	1
dispute	1
further	1
had	1
they	1
not	1
heard	1
the	1
notes	1
of	1
the	1
fife	1
and	1
drums	1
once	1
more,	1
from	1
which	1
they	1
concluded	1
that	1
the	1
Distressed	1
Duenna	1
was	1
making	1
her	1
entrance.	1
The	1
duchess	1
asked	1
the	1
duke	1
if	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
proper	1
to	1
go	1
out	1
to	1
receive	1
her,	1
as	1
she	1
was	1
a	1
countess	1
and	1
a	1
person	1
of	1
rank.	1
“In	1
respect	1
of	1
her	1
being	1
a	1
countess,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
before	1
the	1
duke	1
could	1
reply,	1
“I	1
am	1
for	1
your	1
highnesses	1
going	1
out	1
to	1
receive	1
her;	1
but	1
in	1
respect	1
of	1
her	1
being	1
a	1
duenna,	1
it	1
is	1
my	1
opinion	1
you	1
should	1
not	1
stir	1
a	1
step.”	1
“Who	1
bade	1
thee	1
meddle	1
in	1
this,	1
Sancho?”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote.	1
“Who,	1
señor?”	1
said	1
Sancho;	1
“I	1
meddle	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
a	1
right	1
to	1
meddle,	1
as	1
a	1
squire	1
who	1
has	1
learned	1
the	1
rules	1
of	1
courtesy	1
in	1
the	1
school	1
of	1
your	1
worship,	1
the	1
most	1
courteous	1
and	1
best-bred	1
knight	1
in	1
the	1
whole	1
world	1
of	1
courtliness;	1
and	1
in	1
these	1
things,	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
heard	1
your	1
worship	1
say,	1
as	1
much	1
is	1
lost	1
by	1
a	1
card	1
too	1
many	1
as	1
by	1
a	1
card	1
too	1
few,	1
and	1
to	1
one	1
who	1
has	1
his	1
ears	1
open,	1
few	1
words.”	1
“Sancho	1
is	1
right,”	1
said	1
the	1
duke;	1
“we’ll	1

what	1
the	1
countess	1
is	1
like,	1
and	1
by	1
that	1
measure	1
the	1
courtesy	1
that	1
is	1
due	1
to	1
her.”	1
And	1
now	1
the	1
drums	1
and	1
fife	1
made	1
their	1
entrance	1
as	1
before;	1
and	1
here	1
the	1
author	1
brought	1
this	1
short	1
chapter	1
to	1
an	1
end	1
and	1
began	1
the	1
next,	1
following	1
up	1
the	1
same	1
adventure,	1
which	1
is	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
notable	1
in	1
the	1
history.	1

Following	1
the	1
melancholy	1
musicians	1
there	1
filed	1
into	1
the	1
garden	1
as	1
many	1
as	1
twelve	1
duennas,	1
in	1
two	1
lines,	1
all	1
dressed	1
in	1
ample	1
mourning	1
robes	1
apparently	1
of	1
milled	1
serge,	1
with	1
hoods	1
of	1
fine	1
white	1
gauze	1
so	1
long	1
that	1
they	1
allowed	1
only	1
the	1
border	1
of	1
the	1
robe	1
to	1
be	1
seen.	1
Behind	1
them	1
came	1
the	1
Countess	1
Trifaldi,	1
the	1
squire	1
Trifaldin	1
of	1
the	1
White	1
Beard	1
leading	1
her	1
by	1
the	1
hand,	1
clad	1
in	1
the	1
finest	1
unnapped	1
black	1
baize,	1
such	1
that,	1
had	1
it	1
a	1
nap,	1
every	1
tuft	1
would	1
have	1
shown	1
as	1
big	1
as	1
a	1
Martos	1
chickpea;	1
the	1
tail,	1
or	1
skirt,	1
or	1
whatever	1
it	1
might	1
be	1
called,	1
ended	1
in	1
three	1
points	1
which	1
were	1
borne	1
up	1
by	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
three	1
pages,	1
likewise	1
dressed	1
in	1
mourning,	1
forming	1
an	1
elegant	1
geometrical	1
figure	1
with	1
the	1
three	1
acute	1
angles	1
made	1
by	1
the	1
three	1
points,	1
from	1
which	1
all	1
who	1
saw	1
the	1
peaked	1
skirt	1
concluded	1
that	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
because	1
of	1
it	1
the	1
countess	1
was	1
called	1
Trifaldi,	1
as	1
though	1
it	1
were	1
Countess	1
of	1
the	1
Three	1
Skirts;	1
and	1
Benengeli	1
says	1
it	1
was	1
so,	1
and	1
that	1
by	1
her	1
right	1
name	1
she	1
was	1
called	1
the	1
Countess	1
Lobuna,	1
because	1
wolves	1
bred	1
in	1
great	1
numbers	1
in	1
her	1
country;	1
and	1
if,	1
instead	1
of	1
wolves,	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
foxes,	1
she	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
called	1
the	1
Countess	1
Zorruna,	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
custom	1
in	1
those	1
parts	1
for	1
lords	1
to	1
take	1
distinctive	1
titles	1
from	1
the	1
thing	1
or	1
things	1
most	1
abundant	1
in	1
their	1
dominions;	1
this	1
countess,	1
however,	1
in	1
honour	1
of	1
the	1
new	1
fashion	1
of	1
her	1
skirt,	1
dropped	1
Lobuna	1
and	1
took	1
up	1
Trifaldi.	1
The	1
twelve	1
duennas	1
and	1
the	1
lady	1
came	1
on	1
at	1
procession	1
pace,	1
their	1
faces	1
being	1
covered	1
with	1
black	1
veils,	1
not	1
transparent	1
ones	1
like	1
Trifaldin’s,	1
but	1
so	1
close	1
that	1
they	1
allowed	1
nothing	1
to	1
be	1
seen	1
through	1
them.	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
the	1
band	1
of	1
duennas	1
was	1
fully	1
in	1
sight,	1
the	1
duke,	1
the	1
duchess,	1
and	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
stood	1
up,	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
all	1
who	1
were	1
watching	1
the	1
slow-moving	1
procession.	1
The	1
twelve	1
duennas	1
halted	1
and	1
formed	1
a	1
lane,	1
along	1
which	1
the	1
Distressed	1
One	1
advanced,	1
Trifaldin	1
still	1
holding	1
her	1
hand.	1
On	1
seeing	1
this	1
the	1
duke,	1
the	1
duchess,	1
and	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
went	1
some	1
twelve	1
paces	1
forward	1
to	1
meet	1
her.	1
She	1
then,	1
kneeling	1
on	1
the	1
ground,	1
said	1
in	1
a	1
voice	1
hoarse	1
and	1
rough,	1
rather	1
than	1
fine	1
and	1
delicate,	1
“May	1
it	1
please	1
your	1
highnesses	1
not	1
to	1
offer	1
such	1
courtesies	1
to	1
this	1
your	1
servant,	1
I	1
should	1
say	1
to	1
this	1
your	1
handmaid,	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
in	1
such	1
distress	1
that	1
I	1
shall	1
never	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
proper	1
return,	1
because	1
my	1
strange	1
and	1
unparalleled	1
misfortune	1
has	1
carried	1
off	1
my	1
wits,	1
and	1
I	1
know	1
not	1
whither;	1
but	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
a	1
long	1
way	1
off,	1
for	1
the	1
more	1
I	1
look	1
for	1
them	1
the	1
less	1
I	1
find	1
them.”	1
“He	1
would	1
be	1
wanting	1
in	1
wits,	1
señora	1
countess,”	1
said	1
the	1
duke,	1
“who	1
did	1
not	1
perceive	1
your	1
worth	1
by	1
your	1
person,	1
for	1
at	1
a	1
glance	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
seen	1
it	1
deserves	1
all	1
the	1
cream	1
of	1
courtesy	1
and	1
flower	1
of	1
polite	1
usage;”	1
and	1
raising	1
her	1
up	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
he	1
led	1
her	1
to	1
a	1
seat	1
beside	1
the	1
duchess,	1
who	1
likewise	1
received	1
her	1
with	1
great	1
urbanity.	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
remained	1
silent,	1
while	1
Sancho	1
was	1
dying	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
features	1
of	1
Trifaldi	1
and	1
one	1
or	1
two	1
of	1
her	1
many	1
duennas;	1
but	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
possibility	1
of	1
it	1
until	1
they	1
themselves	1
displayed	1
them	1
of	1
their	1
own	1
accord	1
and	1
free	1
will.	1
All	1
kept	1
still,	1
waiting	1
to	1
see	1
who	1
would	1
break	1
silence,	1
which	1
the	1
Distressed	1
Duenna	1
did	1
in	1
these	1
words:	1
“I	1
am	1
confident,	1
most	1
mighty	1
lord,	1
most	1
fair	1
lady,	1
and	1
most	1
discreet	1
company,	1
that	1
my	1
most	1
miserable	1
misery	1
will	1
be	1
accorded	1
a	1
reception	1
no	1
less	1
dispassionate	1
than	1
generous	1
and	1
condolent	1
in	1
your	1
most	1
valiant	1
bosoms,	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
one	1
that	1
is	1
enough	1
to	1
melt	1
marble,	1
soften	1
diamonds,	1
and	1
mollify	1
the	1
steel	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
hardened	1
hearts	1
in	1
the	1
world;	1
but	1
ere	1
it	1
is	1
proclaimed	1
to	1
your	1
hearing,	1
not	1
to	1
say	1
your	1
ears,	1
I	1
would	1
fain	1
be	1
enlightened	1
whether	1
there	1
be	1
present	1
in	1
this	1
society,	1
circle,	1
or	1
company,	1
that	1
knight	1
immaculatissimus,	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
de	1
la	1
Manchissima,	1
and	1
his	1
squirissimus	1
Panza.”	1
“The	1
Panza	1
is	1
here,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
before	1
anyone	1
could	1
reply,	1
“and	1
Don	1
Quixotissimus	1
too;	1
and	1
so,	1
most	1
distressedest	1
Duenissima,	1
you	1
may	1
say	1
what	1
you	1
willissimus,	1
for	1
we	1
are	1
all	1
readissimus	1
to	1
do	1
you	1
any	1
servissimus.”	1
On	1
this	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
rose,	1
and	1
addressing	1
the	1
Distressed	1
Duenna,	1
said,	1
“If	1
your	1
sorrows,	1
afflicted	1
lady,	1
can	1
indulge	1
in	1
any	1
hope	1
of	1
relief	1
from	1
the	1
valour	1
or	1
might	1
of	1
any	1
knight-errant,	1
here	1
are	1
mine,	1
which,	1
feeble	1
and	1
limited	1
though	1
they	1
be,	1
shall	1
be	1
entirely	1
devoted	1
to	1
your	1
service.	1
I	1
am	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
of	1
La	1
Mancha,	1
whose	1
calling	1
it	1
is	1
to	1
give	1
aid	1
to	1
the	1
needy	1
of	1
all	1
sorts;	1
and	1
that	1
being	1
so,	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
necessary	1
for	1
you,	1
señora,	1
to	1
make	1
any	1
appeal	1
to	1
benevolence,	1
or	1
deal	1
in	1
preambles,	1
only	1
to	1
tell	1
your	1
woes	1
plainly	1
and	1
straightforwardly:	1
for	1
you	1
have	1
hearers	1
that	1
will	1
know	1
how,	1
if	1
not	1
to	1
remedy	1
them,	1
to	1
sympathise	1
with	1
them.”	1
On	1
hearing	1
this,	1
the	1
Distressed	1
Duenna	1
made	1
as	1
though	1
she	1
would	1
throw	1
herself	1
at	1
Don	1
Quixote’s	1
feet,	1
and	1
actually	1
did	1
fall	1
before	1
them	1
and	1
said,	1
as	1
she	1
strove	1
to	1
embrace	1
them,	1
“Before	1
these	1
feet	1
and	1
legs	1
I	1
cast	1
myself,	1
O	1
unconquered	1
knight,	1
as	1
before,	1
what	1
they	1
are,	1
the	1
foundations	1
and	1
pillars	1
of	1
knight-errantry;	1
these	1
feet	1
I	1
desire	1
to	1
kiss,	1
for	1
upon	1
their	1
steps	1
hangs	1
and	1
depends	1
the	1
sole	1
remedy	1
for	1
my	1
misfortune,	1
O	1
valorous	1
errant,	1
whose	1
veritable	1
achievements	1
leave	1
behind	1
and	1
eclipse	1
the	1
fabulous	1
ones	1
of	1
the	1
Amadises,	1
Esplandians,	1
and	1
Belianises!”	1
Then	1
turning	1
from	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
to	1
Sancho	1
Panza,	1
and	1
grasping	1
his	1
hands,	1
she	1
said,	1
“O	1
thou,	1
most	1
loyal	1
squire	1
that	1
ever	1
served	1
knight-errant	1
in	1
this	1
present	1
age	1
or	1
ages	1
past,	1
whose	1
goodness	1
is	1
more	1
extensive	1
than	1
the	1
beard	1
of	1
Trifaldin	1
my	1
companion	1
here	1
of	1
present,	1
well	1
mayest	1
thou	1
boast	1
thyself	1
that,	1
in	1
serving	1
the	1
great	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
thou	1
art	1
serving,	1
summed	1
up	1
in	1
one,	1
the	1
whole	1
host	1
of	1
knights	1
that	1
have	1
ever	1
borne	1
arms	1
in	1
the	1
world.	1
I	1
conjure	1
thee,	1
by	1
what	1
thou	1
owest	1
to	1
thy	1
most	1
loyal	1
goodness,	1
that	1
thou	1
wilt	1
become	1
my	1
kind	1
intercessor	1
with	1
thy	1
master,	1
that	1
he	1
speedily	1
give	1
aid	1
to	1
this	1
most	1
humble	1
and	1
most	1
unfortunate	1
countess.”	1
To	1
this	1
Sancho	1
made	1
answer,	1
“As	1
to	1
my	1
goodness,	1
señora,	1
being	1
as	1
long	1
and	1
as	1
great	1
as	1
your	1
squire’s	1
beard,	1
it	1
matters	1
very	1
little	1
to	1
me;	1
may	1
I	1
have	1
my	1
soul	1
well	1
bearded	1
and	1
moustached	1
when	1
it	1
comes	1
to	1
quit	1
this	1
life,	1
that’s	1
the	1
point;	1
about	1
beards	1
here	1
below	1
I	1
care	1
little	1
or	1
nothing;	1
but	1
without	1
all	1
these	1
blandishments	1
and	1
prayers,	1
I	1
will	1
beg	1
my	1
master	1
(for	1
I	1
know	1
he	1
loves	1
me,	1
and,	1
besides,	1
he	1
has	1
need	1
of	1
me	1
just	1
now	1
for	1
a	1
certain	1
business)	1
to	1
help	1
and	1
aid	1
your	1
worship	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
he	1
can;	1
unpack	1
your	1
woes	1
and	1
lay	1
them	1
before	1
us,	1
and	1
leave	1
us	1
to	1
deal	1
with	1
them,	1
for	1
we’ll	1
be	1
all	1
of	1
one	1
mind.”	1
The	1
duke	1
and	1
duchess,	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
they	1
who	1
had	1
made	1
the	1
experiment	1
of	1
this	1
adventure,	1
were	1
ready	1
to	1
burst	1
with	1
laughter	1
at	1
all	1
this,	1
and	1
between	1
themselves	1
they	1
commended	1
the	1
clever	1
acting	1
of	1
the	1
Trifaldi,	1
who,	1
returning	1
to	1
her	1
seat,	1
said,	1
“Queen	1
Doña	1
Maguncia	1
reigned	1
over	1
the	1
famous	1
kingdom	1
of	1
Kandy,	1
which	1
lies	1
between	1
the	1
great	1
Trapobana	1
and	1
the	1
Southern	1
Sea,	1
two	1
leagues	1
beyond	1
Cape	1
Comorin.	1
She	1
was	1
the	1
widow	1
of	1
King	1
Archipiela,	1
her	1
lord	1
and	1
husband,	1
and	1
of	1
their	1
marriage	1
they	1
had	1
issue	1
the	1
Princess	1
Antonomasia,	1
heiress	1
of	1
the	1
kingdom;	1
which	1
Princess	1
Antonomasia	1
was	1
reared	1
and	1
brought	1
up	1
under	1
my	1
care	1
and	1
direction,	1
I	1
being	1
the	1
oldest	1
and	1
highest	1
in	1
rank	1
of	1
her	1
mother’s	1
duennas.	1
Time	1
passed,	1
and	1
the	1
young	1
Antonomasia	1
reached	1
the	1
age	1
of	1
fourteen,	1
and	1
such	1
a	1
perfection	1
of	1
beauty,	1
that	1
nature	1
could	1
not	1
raise	1
it	1
higher.	1
Then,	1
it	1
must	1
not	1
be	1
supposed	1
her	1
intelligence	1
was	1
childish;	1
she	1
was	1
as	1
intelligent	1
as	1
she	1
was	1
fair,	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
fairer	1
than	1
all	1
the	1
world;	1
and	1
is	1
so	1
still,	1
unless	1
the	1
envious	1
fates	1
and	1
hard-hearted	1
sisters	1
three	1
have	1
cut	1
for	1
her	1
the	1
thread	1
of	1
life.	1
But	1
that	1
they	1
have	1
not,	1
for	1
Heaven	1
will	1
not	1
suffer	1
so	1
great	1
a	1
wrong	1
to	1
Earth,	1
as	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
to	1
pluck	1
unripe	1
the	1
grapes	1
of	1
the	1
fairest	1
vineyard	1
on	1
its	1
surface.	1
Of	1
this	1
beauty,	1
to	1
which	1
my	1
poor	1
feeble	1
tongue	1
has	1
failed	1
to	1
do	1
justice,	1
countless	1
princes,	1
not	1
only	1
of	1
that	1
country,	1
but	1
of	1
others,	1
were	1
enamoured,	1
and	1
among	1
them	1
a	1
private	1
gentleman,	1
who	1
was	1
at	1
the	1
court,	1
dared	1
to	1
raise	1
his	1
thoughts	1
to	1
the	1
heaven	1
of	1
so	1
great	1
beauty,	1
trusting	1
to	1
his	1
youth,	1
his	1
gallant	1
bearing,	1
his	1
numerous	1
accomplishments	1
and	1
graces,	1
and	1
his	1
quickness	1
and	1
readiness	1
of	1
wit;	1
for	1
I	1
may	1
tell	1
your	1
highnesses,	1
if	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
wearying	1
you,	1
that	1
he	1
played	1
the	1
guitar	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
make	1
it	1
speak,	1
and	1
he	1
was,	1
besides,	1
a	1
poet	1
and	1
a	1
great	1
dancer,	1
and	1
he	1
could	1
make	1
birdcages	1
so	1
well,	1
that	1
by	1
making	1
them	1
alone	1
he	1
might	1
have	1
gained	1
a	1
livelihood,	1
had	1
he	1
found	1
himself	1
reduced	1
to	1
utter	1
poverty;	1
and	1
gifts	1
and	1
graces	1
of	1
this	1
kind	1
are	1
enough	1
to	1
bring	1
down	1
a	1
mountain,	1
not	1
to	1
say	1
a	1
tender	1
young	1
girl.	1
But	1
all	1
his	1
gallantry,	1
wit,	1
and	1
gaiety,	1
all	1
his	1
graces	1
and	1
accomplishments,	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
of	1
little	1
or	1
no	1
avail	1
towards	1
gaining	1
the	1
fortress	1
of	1
my	1
pupil,	1
had	1
not	1
the	1
impudent	1
thief	1
taken	1
the	1
precaution	1
of	1
gaining	1
me	1
over	1
first.	1
First,	1
the	1
villain	1
and	1
heartless	1
vagabond	1
sought	1
to	1
win	1
my	1
good-will	1
and	1
purchase	1
my	1
compliance,	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
get	1
me,	1
like	1
a	1
treacherous	1
warder,	1
to	1
deliver	1
up	1
to	1
him	1
the	1
keys	1
of	1
the	1
fortress	1
I	1
had	1
in	1
charge.	1
In	1
a	1
word,	1
he	1
gained	1
an	1
influence	1
over	1
my	1
mind,	1
and	1
overcame	1
my	1
resolutions	1
with	1
I	1
know	1
not	1
what	1
trinkets	1
and	1
jewels	1
he	1
gave	1
me;	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
some	1
verses	1
I	1
heard	1
him	1
singing	1
one	1
night	1
from	1
a	1
grating	1
that	1
opened	1
on	1
the	1
street	1
where	1
he	1
lived,	1
that,	1
more	1
than	1
anything	1
else,	1
made	1
me	1
give	1
way	1
and	1
led	1
to	1
my	1
fall;	1
and	1
if	1
I	1
remember	1
rightly	1
they	1
ran	1
thus:	1
From	1
that	1
sweet	1
enemy	1
of	1
mine	1
My	1
bleeding	1
heart	1
hath	1
had	1
its	1
wound;	1
And	1
to	1
increase	1
the	1
pain	1
I’m	1
bound	1
To	1
suffer	1
and	1
to	1
make	1
no	1
sign.	1
The	1
lines	1
seemed	1
pearls	1
to	1
me	1
and	1
his	1
voice	1
sweet	1
as	1
syrup;	1
and	1
afterwards,	1
I	1
may	1
say	1
ever	1
since	1
then,	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1
misfortune	1
into	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
fallen,	1
I	1
have	1
thought	1
that	1
poets,	1
as	1
Plato	1
advised,	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
banished	1
from	1
all	1
well-ordered	1
States;	1
at	1
least	1
the	1
amatory	1
ones,	1
for	1
they	1
write	1
verses,	1
not	1
like	1
those	1
of	1
‘The	1
Marquis	1
of	1
Mantua,’	1
that	1
delight	1
and	1
draw	1
tears	1
from	1
the	1
women	1
and	1
children,	1
but	1
sharp-pointed	1
conceits	1
that	1
pierce	1
the	1
heart	1
like	1
soft	1
thorns,	1
and	1
like	1
the	1
lightning	1
strike	1
it,	1
leaving	1
the	1
raiment	1
uninjured.	1
Another	1
time	1
he	1
sang:	1
Come	1
Death,	1
so	1
subtly	1
veiled	1
that	1
I	1
Thy	1
coming	1
know	1
not,	1
how	1
or	1
when,	1
Lest	1
it	1
should	1
give	1
me	1
life	1
again	1
To	1
find	1
how	1
sweet	1
it	1
is	1
to	1
die.	1
—and	1
other	1
verses	1
and	1
burdens	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
sort,	1
such	1
as	1
enchant	1
when	1
sung	1
and	1
fascinate	1
when	1
written.	1
And	1
then,	1
when	1
they	1
condescend	1
to	1
compose	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
verse	1
that	1
was	1
at	1
that	1
time	1
in	1
vogue	1
in	1
Kandy,	1
which	1
they	1
call	1
seguidillas!	1
Then	1
it	1
is	1
that	1
hearts	1
leap	1
and	1
laughter	1
breaks	1
forth,	1
and	1
the	1
body	1
grows	1
restless	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
senses	1
turn	1
quicksilver.	1
And	1
so	1
I	1
say,	1
sirs,	1
that	1
these	1
troubadours	1
richly	1
deserve	1
to	1
be	1
banished	1
to	1
the	1
isles	1
of	1
the	1
lizards.	1
Though	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
they	1
that	1
are	1
in	1
fault,	1
but	1
the	1
simpletons	1
that	1
extol	1
them,	1
and	1
the	1
fools	1
that	1
believe	1
in	1
them;	1
and	1
had	1
I	1
been	1
the	1
faithful	1
duenna	1
I	1
should	1
have	1
been,	1
his	1
stale	1
conceits	1
would	1
have	1
never	1
moved	1
me,	1
nor	1
should	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
taken	1
in	1
by	1
such	1
phrases	1
as	1
‘in	1
death	1
I	1
live,’	1
‘in	1
ice	1
I	1
burn,’	1
‘in	1
flames	1
I	1
shiver,’	1
‘hopeless	1
I	1
hope,’	1
‘I	1
go	1
and	1
stay,’	1
and	1
paradoxes	1
of	1
that	1
sort	1
which	1
their	1
writings	1
are	1
full	1
of.	1
And	1
then	1
when	1
they	1
promise	1
the	1
Phœnix	1
of	1
Arabia,	1
the	1
crown	1
of	1
Ariadne,	1
the	1
horses	1
of	1
the	1
Sun,	1
the	1
pearls	1
of	1
the	1
South,	1
the	1
gold	1
of	1
Tibar,	1
and	1
the	1
balsam	1
of	1
Panchaia!	1
Then	1
it	1
is	1
they	1
give	1
a	1
loose	1
to	1
their	1
pens,	1
for	1
it	1
costs	1
them	1
little	1
to	1
make	1
promises	1
they	1
have	1
no	1
intention	1
or	1
power	1
of	1
fulfilling.	1
But	1
where	1
am	1
I	1
wandering	1
to?	1
Woe	1
is	1
me,	1
unfortunate	1
being!	1
What	1
madness	1
or	1
folly	1
leads	1
me	1
to	1
speak	1
of	1
the	1
faults	1
of	1
others,	1
when	1
there	1
is	1
so	1
much	1
to	1
be	1
said	1
about	1
my	1
own?	1
Again,	1
woe	1
is	1
me,	1
hapless	1
that	1
I	1
am!	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
verses	1
that	1
conquered	1
me,	1
but	1
my	1
own	1
simplicity;	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
music	1
made	1
me	1
yield,	1
but	1
my	1
own	1
imprudence;	1
my	1
own	1
great	1
ignorance	1
and	1
little	1
caution	1
opened	1
the	1
way	1
and	1
cleared	1
the	1
path	1
for	1
Don	1
Clavijo’s	1
advances,	1
for	1
that	1
was	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
gentleman	1
I	1
have	1
referred	1
to;	1
and	1
so,	1
with	1
my	1
help	1
as	1
go-between,	1
he	1
found	1
his	1
way	1
many	1
a	1
time	1
into	1
the	1
chamber	1
of	1
the	1
deceived	1
Antonomasia	1
(deceived	1
not	1
by	1
him	1
but	1
by	1
me)	1
under	1
the	1
title	1
of	1
a	1
lawful	1
husband;	1
for,	1
sinner	1
though	1
I	1
was,	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
allowed	1
him	1
to	1
approach	1
the	1
edge	1
of	1
her	1
shoe-sole	1
without	1
being	1
her	1
husband.	1
No,	1
no,	1
not	1
that;	1
marriage	1
must	1
come	1
first	1
in	1
any	1
business	1
of	1
this	1
sort	1
that	1
I	1
take	1
in	1
hand.	1
But	1
there	1
was	1
one	1
hitch	1
in	1
this	1
case,	1
which	1
was	1
that	1
of	1
inequality	1
of	1
rank,	1
Don	1
Clavijo	1
being	1
a	1
private	1
gentleman,	1
and	1
the	1
Princess	1
Antonomasia,	1
as	1
I	1
said,	1
heiress	1
to	1
the	1
kingdom.	1
The	1
entanglement	1
remained	1
for	1
some	1
time	1
a	1
secret,	1
kept	1
hidden	1
by	1
my	1
cunning	1
precautions,	1
until	1
I	1
perceived	1
that	1
a	1
certain	1
expansion	1
of	1
waist	1
in	1
Antonomasia	1
must	1
before	1
long	1
disclose	1
it,	1
the	1
dread	1
of	1
which	1
made	1
us	1
all	1
there	1
take	1
counsel	1
together,	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
agreed	1
that	1
before	1
the	1
mischief	1
came	1
to	1
light,	1
Don	1
Clavijo	1
should	1
demand	1
Antonomasia	1
as	1
his	1
wife	1
before	1
the	1
Vicar,	1
in	1
virtue	1
of	1
an	1
agreement	1
to	1
marry	1
him	1
made	1
by	1
the	1
princess,	1
and	1
drafted	1
by	1
my	1
wit	1
in	1
such	1
binding	1
terms	1
that	1
the	1
might	1
of	1
Samson	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
broken	1
it.	1
The	1
necessary	1
steps	1
were	1
taken;	1
the	1
Vicar	1
saw	1
the	1
agreement,	1
and	1
took	1
the	1
lady’s	1
confession;	1
she	1
confessed	1
everything	1
in	1
full,	1
and	1
he	1
ordered	1
her	1
into	1
the	1
custody	1
of	1
a	1
very	1
worthy	1
alguacil	1
of	1
the	1
court.”	1
“Are	1
there	1
alguacils	1
of	1
the	1
court	1
in	1
Kandy,	1
too,”	1
said	1
Sancho	1
at	1
this,	1
“and	1
poets,	1
and	1
seguidillas?	1
I	1
swear	1
I	1
think	1
the	1
world	1
is	1
the	1
same	1
all	1
over!	1
But	1
make	1
haste,	1
Señora	1
Trifaldi;	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
late,	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
dying	1
to	1
know	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
this	1
long	1
story.”	1
“I	1
will,”	1
replied	1
the	1
countess.	1

MEMORABLE	1
STORY	1

(96K)	1
Full	1
Size	1
By	1
every	1
word	1
that	1
Sancho	1
uttered,	1
the	1
duchess	1
was	1
as	1
much	1
delighted	1
as	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
was	1
driven	1
to	1
desperation.	1
He	1
bade	1
him	1
hold	1
his	1
tongue,	1
and	1
the	1
Distressed	1
One	1
went	1
on	1
to	1
say:	1
“At	1
length,	1
after	1
much	1
questioning	1
and	1
answering,	1
as	1
the	1
princess	1
held	1
to	1
her	1
story,	1
without	1
changing	1
or	1
varying	1
her	1
previous	1
declaration,	1
the	1
Vicar	1
gave	1
his	1
decision	1
in	1
favour	1
of	1
Don	1
Clavijo,	1
and	1
she	1
was	1
delivered	1
over	1
to	1
him	1
as	1
his	1
lawful	1
wife;	1
which	1
the	1
Queen	1
Doña	1
Maguncia,	1
the	1
Princess	1
Antonomasia’s	1
mother,	1
so	1
took	1
to	1
heart,	1
that	1
within	1
the	1
space	1
of	1
three	1
days	1
we	1
buried	1
her.”	1
“She	1
died,	1
no	1
doubt,”	1
said	1
Sancho.	1
“Of	1
course,”	1
said	1
Trifaldin;	1
“they	1
don’t	1
bury	1
living	1
people	1
in	1
Kandy,	1
only	1
the	1
dead.”	1
“Señor	1
Squire,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“a	1
man	1
in	1
a	1
swoon	1
has	1
been	1
known	1
to	1
be	1
buried	1
before	1
now,	1
in	1
the	1
belief	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
dead;	1
and	1
it	1
struck	1
me	1
that	1
Queen	1
Maguncia	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
swooned	1
rather	1
than	1
died;	1
because	1
with	1
life	1
a	1
great	1
many	1
things	1
come	1
right,	1
and	1
the	1
princess’s	1
folly	1
was	1
not	1
so	1
great	1
that	1
she	1
need	1
feel	1
it	1
so	1
keenly.	1
If	1
the	1
lady	1
had	1
married	1
some	1
page	1
of	1
hers,	1
or	1
some	1
other	1
servant	1
of	1
the	1
house,	1
as	1
many	1
another	1
has	1
done,	1
so	1
I	1
have	1
heard	1
say,	1
then	1
the	1
mischief	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
past	1
curing.	1
But	1
to	1
marry	1
such	1
an	1
elegant	1
accomplished	1
gentleman	1
as	1
has	1
been	1
just	1
now	1
described	1
to	1
us—indeed,	1
indeed,	1
though	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
folly,	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
such	1
a	1
great	1
one	1
as	1
you	1
think;	1
for	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
rules	1
of	1
my	1
master	1
here—and	1
he	1
won’t	1
allow	1
me	1
to	1
lie—as	1
of	1
men	1
of	1
letters	1
bishops	1
are	1
made,	1
so	1
of	1
gentlemen	1
knights,	1
specially	1
if	1
they	1
be	1
errant,	1
kings	1
and	1
emperors	1
may	1
be	1
made.”	1
“Thou	1
art	1
right,	1
Sancho,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“for	1
with	1
a	1
knight-errant,	1
if	1
he	1
has	1
but	1
two	1
fingers’	1
breadth	1
of	1
good	1
fortune,	1
it	1
is	1
on	1
the	1
cards	1
to	1
become	1
the	1
mightiest	1
lord	1
on	1
earth.	1
But	1
let	1
señora	1
the	1
Distressed	1
One	1
proceed;	1
for	1
I	1
suspect	1
she	1
has	1
got	1
yet	1
to	1
tell	1
us	1
the	1
bitter	1
part	1
of	1
this	1
so	1
far	1
sweet	1
story.”	1
“The	1
bitter	1
is	1
indeed	1
to	1
come,”	1
said	1
the	1
countess;	1
“and	1
such	1
bitter	1
that	1
colocynth	1
is	1
sweet	1
and	1
oleander	1
toothsome	1
in	1
comparison.	1
The	1
queen,	1
then,	1
being	1
dead,	1
and	1
not	1
in	1
a	1
swoon,	1
we	1
buried	1
her;	1
and	1
hardly	1
had	1
we	1
covered	1
her	1
with	1
earth,	1
hardly	1
had	1
we	1
said	1
our	1
last	1
farewells,	1
when,	1
_quis	1
talia	1
fando	1
temperet	1
a	1
lachrymis?_	1
over	1
the	1
queen’s	1
grave	1
there	1
appeared,	1
mounted	1
upon	1
a	1
wooden	1
horse,	1
the	1
giant	1
Malambruno,	1
Maguncia’s	1
first	1
cousin,	1
who	1
besides	1
being	1
cruel	1
is	1
an	1
enchanter;	1
and	1
he,	1
to	1
revenge	1
the	1
death	1
of	1
his	1
cousin,	1
punish	1
the	1
audacity	1
of	1
Don	1
Clavijo,	1
and	1
in	1
wrath	1
at	1
the	1
contumacy	1
of	1
Antonomasia,	1
left	1
them	1
both	1
enchanted	1
by	1
his	1
art	1
on	1
the	1
grave	1
itself;	1
she	1
being	1
changed	1
into	1
an	1
ape	1
of	1
brass,	1
and	1
he	1
into	1
a	1
horrible	1
crocodile	1
of	1
some	1
unknown	1
metal;	1
while	1
between	1
the	1
two	1
there	1
stands	1
a	1
pillar,	1
also	1
of	1
metal,	1
with	1
certain	1
characters	1
in	1
the	1
Syriac	1
language	1
inscribed	1
upon	1
it,	1
which,	1
being	1
translated	1
into	1
Kandian,	1
and	1
now	1
into	1
Castilian,	1
contain	1
the	1
following	1
sentence:	1
‘These	1
two	1
rash	1
lovers	1
shall	1
not	1
recover	1
their	1
former	1
shape	1
until	1
the	1
valiant	1
Manchegan	1
comes	1
to	1
do	1
battle	1
with	1
me	1
in	1
single	1
combat;	1
for	1
the	1
Fates	1
reserve	1
this	1
unexampled	1
adventure	1
for	1
his	1
mighty	1
valour	1
alone.’	1
This	1
done,	1
he	1
drew	1
from	1
its	1
sheath	1
a	1
huge	1
broad	1
scimitar,	1
and	1
seizing	1
me	1
by	1
the	1
hair	1
he	1
made	1
as	1
though	1
he	1
meant	1
to	1
cut	1
my	1
throat	1
and	1
shear	1
my	1
head	1
clean	1
off.	1
I	1
was	1
terror-stricken,	1
my	1
voice	1
stuck	1
in	1
my	1
throat,	1
and	1
I	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
deepest	1
distress;	1
nevertheless	1
I	1
summoned	1
up	1
my	1
strength	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
I	1
could,	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
trembling	1
and	1
piteous	1
voice	1
I	1
addressed	1
such	1
words	1
to	1
him	1
as	1
induced	1
him	1
to	1
stay	1
the	1
infliction	1
of	1
a	1
punishment	1
so	1
severe.	1
He	1
then	1
caused	1
all	1
the	1
duennas	1
of	1
the	1
palace,	1
those	1
that	1
are	1
here	1
present,	1
to	1
be	1
brought	1
before	1
him;	1
and	1
after	1
having	1
dwelt	1
upon	1
the	1
enormity	1
of	1
our	1
offence,	1
and	1
denounced	1
duennas,	1
their	1
characters,	1
their	1
evil	1
ways	1
and	1
worse	1
intrigues,	1
laying	1
to	1
the	1
charge	1
of	1
all	1
what	1
I	1
alone	1
was	1
guilty	1
of,	1
he	1
said	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
visit	1
us	1
with	1
capital	1
punishment,	1
but	1
with	1
others	1
of	1
a	1
slow	1
nature	1
which	1
would	1
be	1
in	1
effect	1
civil	1
death	1
for	1
ever;	1
and	1
the	1
very	1
instant	1
he	1
ceased	1
speaking	1
we	1
all	1
felt	1
the	1
pores	1
of	1
our	1
faces	1
opening,	1
and	1
pricking	1
us,	1
as	1
if	1
with	1
the	1
points	1
of	1
needles.	1
We	1
at	1
once	1
put	1
our	1
hands	1
up	1
to	1
our	1
faces	1
and	1
found	1
ourselves	1
in	1
the	1
state	1
you	1
now	1
see.”	1
Here	1
the	1
Distressed	1
One	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
duennas	1
raised	1
the	1
veils	1
with	1
which	1
they	1
were	1
covered,	1
and	1
disclosed	1
countenances	1
all	1
bristling	1
with	1
beards,	1
some	1
red,	1
some	1
black,	1
some	1
white,	1
and	1
some	1
grizzled,	1
at	1
which	1
spectacle	1
the	1
duke	1
and	1
duchess	1
made	1
a	1
show	1
of	1
being	1
filled	1
with	1
wonder.	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
and	1
Sancho	1
were	1
overwhelmed	1
with	1
amazement,	1
and	1
the	1
bystanders	1
lost	1
in	1
astonishment,	1
while	1
the	1
Trifaldi	1
went	1
on	1
to	1
say:	1
“Thus	1
did	1
that	1
malevolent	1
villain	1
Malambruno	1
punish	1
us,	1
covering	1
the	1
tenderness	1
and	1
softness	1
of	1
our	1
faces	1
with	1
these	1
rough	1
bristles!	1
Would	1
to	1
heaven	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
swept	1
off	1
our	1
heads	1
with	1
his	1
enormous	1
scimitar	1
instead	1
of	1
obscuring	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
our	1
countenances	1
with	1
these	1
wool-combings	1
that	1
cover	1
us!	1
For	1
if	1
we	1
look	1
into	1
the	1
matter,	1
sirs	1
(and	1
what	1
I	1
am	1
now	1
going	1
to	1
say	1
I	1
would	1
say	1
with	1
eyes	1
flowing	1
like	1
fountains,	1
only	1
that	1
the	1
thought	1
of	1
our	1
misfortune	1
and	1
the	1
oceans	1
they	1
have	1
already	1
wept,	1
keep	1
them	1
as	1
dry	1
as	1
barley	1
spears,	1
and	1
so	1
I	1
say	1
it	1
without	1
tears),	1
where,	1
I	1
ask,	1
can	1
a	1
duenna	1
with	1
a	1
beard	1
go	1
to?	1
What	1
father	1
or	1
mother	1
will	1
feel	1
pity	1
for	1
her?	1
Who	1
will	1
help	1
her?	1
For,	1
if	1
even	1
when	1
she	1
has	1
a	1
smooth	1
skin,	1
and	1
a	1
face	1
tortured	1
by	1
a	1
thousand	1
kinds	1
of	1
washes	1
and	1
cosmetics,	1
she	1
can	1
hardly	1
get	1
anybody	1
to	1
love	1
her,	1
what	1
will	1
she	1
do	1
when	1
she	1
shows	1
a	1
countenance	1
turned	1
into	1
a	1
thicket?	1
Oh	1
duennas,	1
companions	1
mine!	1
it	1
was	1
an	1
unlucky	1
moment	1
when	1
we	1
were	1
born	1
and	1
an	1
ill-starred	1
hour	1
when	1
our	1
fathers	1
begot	1
us!”	1
And	1
as	1
she	1
said	1
this	1
she	1
showed	1
signs	1
of	1
being	1
about	1
to	1
faint.	1

O	1

The	1
history	1
goes	1
on	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
when	1
Sancho	1
saw	1
the	1
Distressed	1
One	1
faint	1
he	1
exclaimed:	1
“I	1
swear	1
by	1
the	1
faith	1
of	1
an	1
honest	1
man	1
and	1
the	1
shades	1
of	1
all	1
my	1
ancestors	1
the	1
Panzas,	1
that	1
never	1
I	1
did	1
see	1
or	1
hear	1
of,	1
nor	1
has	1
my	1
master	1
related	1
or	1
conceived	1
in	1
his	1
mind,	1
such	1
an	1
adventure	1
as	1
this.	1
A	1
thousand	1
devils—not	1
to	1
curse	1
thee—take	1
thee,	1
Malambruno,	1
for	1
an	1
enchanter	1
and	1
a	1
giant!	1
Couldst	1
thou	1
find	1
no	1
other	1
sort	1
of	1
punishment	1
for	1
these	1
sinners	1
but	1
bearding	1
them?	1
Would	1
it	1
not	1
have	1
been	1
better—it	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
better	1
for	1
them—to	1
have	1
taken	1
off	1
half	1
their	1
noses	1
from	1
the	1
middle	1
upwards,	1
even	1
though	1
they’d	1
have	1
snuffled	1
when	1
they	1
spoke,	1
than	1
to	1
have	1
put	1
beards	1
on	1
them?	1
I’ll	1
bet	1
they	1
have	1
not	1
the	1
means	1
of	1
paying	1
anybody	1
to	1
shave	1
them.”	1
“That	1
is	1
the	1
truth,	1
señor,”	1
said	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
twelve;	1
“we	1
have	1
not	1
the	1
money	1
to	1
get	1
ourselves	1
shaved,	1
and	1
so	1
we	1
have,	1
some	1
of	1
us,	1
taken	1
to	1
using	1
sticking-plasters	1
by	1
way	1
of	1
an	1
economical	1
remedy,	1
for	1
by	1
applying	1
them	1
to	1
our	1
faces	1
and	1
plucking	1
them	1
off	1
with	1
a	1
jerk	1
we	1
are	1
left	1
as	1
bare	1
and	1
smooth	1
as	1
the	1
bottom	1
of	1
a	1
stone	1
mortar.	1
There	1
are,	1
to	1
be	1
sure,	1
women	1
in	1
Kandy	1
that	1
go	1
about	1
from	1
house	1
to	1
house	1
to	1
remove	1
down,	1
and	1
trim	1
eyebrows,	1
and	1
make	1
cosmetics	1
for	1
the	1
use	1
of	1
the	1
women,	1
but	1
we,	1
the	1
duennas	1
of	1
my	1
lady,	1
would	1
never	1
let	1
them	1
in,	1
for	1
most	1
of	1
them	1
have	1
a	1
flavour	1
of	1
agents	1
that	1
have	1
ceased	1
to	1
be	1
principals;	1
and	1
if	1
we	1
are	1
not	1
relieved	1
by	1
Señor	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
we	1
shall	1
be	1
carried	1
to	1
our	1
graves	1
with	1
beards.”	1
“I	1
will	1
pluck	1
out	1
my	1
own	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
the	1
Moors,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“if	1
I	1
don’t	1
cure	1
yours.”	1
At	1
this	1
instant	1
the	1
Trifaldi	1
recovered	1
from	1
her	1
swoon	1
and	1
said,	1
“The	1
chink	1
of	1
that	1
promise,	1
valiant	1
knight,	1
reached	1
my	1
ears	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
my	1
swoon,	1
and	1
has	1
been	1
the	1
means	1
of	1
reviving	1
me	1
and	1
bringing	1
back	1
my	1
senses;	1
and	1
so	1
once	1
more	1
I	1
implore	1
you,	1
illustrious	1
errant,	1
indomitable	1
sir,	1
to	1
let	1
your	1
gracious	1
promises	1
be	1
turned	1
into	1
deeds.”	1
“There	1
shall	1
be	1
no	1
delay	1
on	1
my	1
part,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote.	1
“Bethink	1
you,	1
señora,	1
of	1
what	1
I	1
must	1
do,	1
for	1
my	1
heart	1
is	1
most	1
eager	1
to	1
serve	1
you.”	1
“The	1
fact	1
is,”	1
replied	1
the	1
Distressed	1
One,	1
“it	1
is	1
five	1
thousand	1
leagues,	1
a	1
couple	1
more	1
or	1
less,	1
from	1
this	1
to	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
Kandy,	1
if	1
you	1
go	1
by	1
land;	1
but	1
if	1
you	1
go	1
through	1
the	1
air	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
straight	1
line,	1
it	1
is	1
three	1
thousand	1
two	1
hundred	1
and	1
twenty-seven.	1
You	1
must	1
know,	1
too,	1
that	1
Malambruno	1
told	1
me	1
that,	1
whenever	1
fate	1
provided	1
the	1
knight	1
our	1
deliverer,	1
he	1
himself	1
would	1
send	1
him	1
a	1
steed	1
far	1
better	1
and	1
with	1
less	1
tricks	1
than	1
a	1
post-horse;	1
for	1
he	1
will	1
be	1
that	1
same	1
wooden	1
horse	1
on	1
which	1
the	1
valiant	1
Pierres	1
carried	1
off	1
the	1
fair	1
Magalona;	1
which	1
said	1
horse	1
is	1
guided	1
by	1
a	1
peg	1
he	1
has	1
in	1
his	1
forehead	1
that	1
serves	1
for	1
a	1
bridle,	1
and	1
flies	1
through	1
the	1
air	1
with	1
such	1
rapidity	1
that	1
you	1
would	1
fancy	1
the	1
very	1
devils	1
were	1
carrying	1
him.	1
This	1
horse,	1
according	1
to	1
ancient	1
tradition,	1
was	1
made	1
by	1
Merlin.	1
He	1
lent	1
him	1
to	1
Pierres,	1
who	1
was	1
a	1
friend	1
of	1
his,	1
and	1
who	1
made	1
long	1
journeys	1
with	1
him,	1
and,	1
as	1
has	1
been	1
said,	1
carried	1
off	1
the	1
fair	1
Magalona,	1
bearing	1
her	1
through	1
the	1
air	1
on	1
its	1
haunches	1
and	1
making	1
all	1
who	1
beheld	1
them	1
from	1
the	1
earth	1
gape	1
with	1
astonishment;	1
and	1
he	1
never	1
lent	1
him	1
save	1
to	1
those	1
whom	1
he	1
loved	1
or	1
those	1
who	1
paid	1
him	1
well;	1
and	1
since	1
the	1
great	1
Pierres	1
we	1
know	1
of	1
no	1
one	1
having	1
mounted	1
him	1
until	1
now.	1
From	1
him	1
Malambruno	1
stole	1
him	1
by	1
his	1
magic	1
art,	1
and	1
he	1
has	1
him	1
now	1
in	1
his	1
possession,	1
and	1
makes	1
use	1
of	1
him	1
in	1
his	1
journeys	1
which	1
he	1
constantly	1
makes	1
through	1
different	1
parts	1
of	1
the	1
world;	1
he	1
is	1
here	1
to-day,	1
to-morrow	1
in	1
France,	1
and	1
the	1
next	1
day	1
in	1
Potosi;	1
and	1
the	1
best	1
of	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
said	1
horse	1
neither	1
eats	1
nor	1
sleeps	1
nor	1
wears	1
out	1
shoes,	1
and	1
goes	1
at	1
an	1
ambling	1
pace	1
through	1
the	1
air	1
without	1
wings,	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
whom	1
he	1
has	1
mounted	1
upon	1
him	1
can	1
carry	1
a	1
cup	1
full	1
of	1
water	1
in	1
his	1
hand	1
without	1
spilling	1
a	1
drop,	1
so	1
smoothly	1
and	1
easily	1
does	1
he	1
go,	1
for	1
which	1
reason	1
the	1
fair	1
Magalona	1
enjoyed	1
riding	1
him	1
greatly.”	1
“For	1
going	1
smoothly	1
and	1
easily,”	1
said	1
Sancho	1
at	1
this,	1
“give	1
me	1
my	1
Dapple,	1
though	1
he	1
can’t	1
go	1
through	1
the	1
air;	1
but	1
on	1
the	1
ground	1
I’ll	1
back	1
him	1
against	1
all	1
the	1
amblers	1
in	1
the	1
world.”	1
They	1
all	1
laughed,	1
and	1
the	1
Distressed	1
One	1
continued:	1
“And	1
this	1
same	1
horse,	1
if	1
so	1
be	1
that	1
Malambruno	1
is	1
disposed	1
to	1
put	1
an	1
end	1
to	1
our	1
sufferings,	1
will	1
be	1
here	1
before	1
us	1
ere	1
the	1
night	1
shall	1
have	1
advanced	1
half	1
an	1
hour;	1
for	1
he	1
announced	1
to	1
me	1
that	1
the	1
sign	1
he	1
would	1
give	1
me	1
whereby	1
I	1
might	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
had	1
found	1
the	1
knight	1
I	1
was	1
in	1
quest	1
of,	1
would	1
be	1
to	1
send	1
me	1
the	1
horse	1
wherever	1
he	1
might	1
be,	1
speedily	1
and	1
promptly.”	1
“And	1
how	1
many	1
is	1
there	1
room	1
for	1
on	1
this	1
horse?”	1
asked	1
Sancho.	1
“Two,”	1
said	1
the	1
Distressed	1
One,	1
“one	1
in	1
the	1
saddle,	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
on	1
the	1
croup;	1
and	1
generally	1
these	1
two	1
are	1
knight	1
and	1
squire,	1
when	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
damsel	1
that’s	1
being	1
carried	1
off.”	1
“I’d	1
like	1
to	1
know,	1
Señora	1
Distressed	1
One,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“what	1
is	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
this	1
horse?”	1
“His	1
name,”	1
said	1
the	1
Distressed	1
One,	1
“is	1
not	1
the	1
same	1
as	1
Bellerophon’s	1
horse	1
that	1
was	1
called	1
Pegasus,	1
or	1
Alexander	1
the	1
Great’s,	1
called	1
Bucephalus,	1
or	1
Orlando	1
Furioso’s,	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
which	1
was	1
Brigliador,	1
nor	1
yet	1
Bayard,	1
the	1
horse	1
of	1
Reinaldos	1
of	1
Montalvan,	1
nor	1
Frontino	1
like	1
Ruggiero’s,	1
nor	1
Bootes	1
or	1
Peritoa,	1
as	1
they	1
say	1
the	1
horses	1
of	1
the	1
sun	1
were	1
called,	1
nor	1
is	1
he	1
called	1
Orelia,	1
like	1
the	1
horse	1
on	1
which	1
the	1
unfortunate	1
Rodrigo,	1
the	1
last	1
king	1
of	1
the	1
Goths,	1
rode	1
to	1
the	1
battle	1
where	1
he	1
lost	1
his	1
life	1
and	1
his	1
kingdom.”	1
“I’ll	1
bet,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“that	1
as	1
they	1
have	1
given	1
him	1
none	1
of	1
these	1
famous	1
names	1
of	1
well-known	1
horses,	1
no	1
more	1
have	1
they	1
given	1
him	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
my	1
master’s	1
Rocinante,	1
which	1
for	1
being	1
apt	1
surpasses	1
all	1
that	1
have	1
been	1
mentioned.”	1
“That	1
is	1
true,”	1
said	1
the	1
bearded	1
countess,	1
“still	1
it	1
fits	1
him	1
very	1
well,	1
for	1
he	1
is	1
called	1
Clavileño	1
the	1
Swift,	1
which	1
name	1
is	1
in	1
accordance	1
with	1
his	1
being	1
made	1
of	1
wood,	1
with	1
the	1
peg	1
he	1
has	1
in	1
his	1
forehead,	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
swift	1
pace	1
at	1
which	1
he	1
travels;	1
and	1
so,	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
name	1
goes,	1
he	1
may	1
compare	1
with	1
the	1
famous	1
Rocinante.”	1
“I	1
have	1
nothing	1
to	1
say	1
against	1
his	1
name,”	1
said	1
Sancho;	1
“but	1
with	1
what	1
sort	1
of	1
bridle	1
or	1
halter	1
is	1
he	1
managed?”	1
“I	1
have	1
said	1
already,”	1
said	1
the	1
Trifaldi,	1
“that	1
it	1
is	1
with	1
a	1
peg,	1
by	1
turning	1
which	1
to	1
one	1
side	1
or	1
the	1
other	1
the	1
knight	1
who	1
rides	1
him	1
makes	1
him	1
go	1
as	1
he	1
pleases,	1
either	1
through	1
the	1
upper	1
air,	1
or	1
skimming	1
and	1
almost	1
sweeping	1
the	1
earth,	1
or	1
else	1
in	1
that	1
middle	1
course	1
that	1
is	1
sought	1
and	1
followed	1
in	1
all	1
well-regulated	1
proceedings.”	1
“I’d	1
like	1
to	1
see	1
him,”	1
said	1
Sancho;	1
“but	1
to	1
fancy	1
I’m	1
going	1
to	1
mount	1
him,	1
either	1
in	1
the	1
saddle	1
or	1
on	1
the	1
croup,	1
is	1
to	1
ask	1
pears	1
of	1
the	1
elm	1
tree.	1
A	1
good	1
joke	1
indeed!	1
I	1
can	1
hardly	1
keep	1
my	1
seat	1
upon	1
Dapple,	1
and	1
on	1
a	1
pack-saddle	1
softer	1
than	1
silk	1
itself,	1
and	1
here	1
they’d	1
have	1
me	1
hold	1
on	1
upon	1
haunches	1
of	1
plank	1
without	1
pad	1
or	1
cushion	1
of	1
any	1
sort!	1
Gad,	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
notion	1
of	1
bruising	1
myself	1
to	1
get	1
rid	1
of	1
anyone’s	1
beard;	1
let	1
each	1
one	1
shave	1
himself	1
as	1
best	1
he	1
can;	1
I’m	1
not	1
going	1
to	1
accompany	1
my	1
master	1
on	1
any	1
such	1
long	1
journey;	1
besides,	1
I	1
can’t	1
give	1
any	1
help	1
to	1
the	1
shaving	1
of	1
these	1
beards	1
as	1
I	1
can	1
to	1
the	1
disenchantment	1
of	1
my	1
lady	1
Dulcinea.”	1
“Yes,	1
you	1
can,	1
my	1
friend,”	1
replied	1
the	1
Trifaldi;	1
“and	1
so	1
much,	1
that	1
without	1
you,	1
so	1
I	1
understand,	1
we	1
shall	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
do	1
nothing.”	1
“In	1
the	1
king’s	1
name!”	1
exclaimed	1
Sancho,	1
“what	1
have	1
squires	1
got	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
the	1
adventures	1
of	1
their	1
masters?	1
Are	1
they	1
to	1
have	1
the	1
fame	1
of	1
such	1
as	1
they	1
go	1
through,	1
and	1
we	1
the	1
labour?	1
Body	1
o’	1
me!	1
if	1
the	1
historians	1
would	1
only	1
say,	1
‘Such	1
and	1
such	1
a	1
knight	1
finished	1
such	1
and	1
such	1
an	1
adventure,	1
but	1
with	1
the	1
help	1
of	1
so	1
and	1
so,	1
his	1
squire,	1
without	1
which	1
it	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
impossible	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
accomplish	1
it;’	1
but	1
they	1
write	1
curtly,	1
“Don	1
Paralipomenon	1
of	1
the	1
Three	1
Stars	1
accomplished	1
the	1
adventure	1
of	1
the	1
six	1
monsters;’	1
without	1
mentioning	1
such	1
a	1
person	1
as	1
his	1
squire,	1
who	1
was	1
there	1
all	1
the	1
time,	1
just	1
as	1
if	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
such	1
being.	1
Once	1
more,	1
sirs,	1
I	1
say	1
my	1
master	1
may	1
go	1
alone,	1
and	1
much	1
good	1
may	1
it	1
do	1
him;	1
and	1
I’ll	1
stay	1
here	1
in	1
the	1
company	1
of	1
my	1
lady	1
the	1
duchess;	1
and	1
maybe	1
when	1
he	1
comes	1
back,	1
he	1
will	1
find	1
the	1
lady	1
Dulcinea’s	1
affair	1
ever	1
so	1
much	1
advanced;	1
for	1
I	1
mean	1
in	1
leisure	1
hours,	1
and	1
at	1
idle	1
moments,	1
to	1
give	1
myself	1
a	1
spell	1
of	1
whipping	1
without	1
so	1
much	1
as	1
a	1
hair	1
to	1
cover	1
me.”	1
“For	1
all	1
that	1
you	1
must	1
go	1
if	1
it	1
be	1
necessary,	1
my	1
good	1
Sancho,”	1
said	1
the	1
duchess,	1
“for	1
they	1
are	1
worthy	1
folk	1
who	1
ask	1
you;	1
and	1
the	1
faces	1
of	1
these	1
ladies	1
must	1
not	1
remain	1
overgrown	1
in	1
this	1
way	1
because	1
of	1
your	1
idle	1
fears;	1
that	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
hard	1
case	1
indeed.”	1
“In	1
the	1
king’s	1
name,	1
once	1
more!”	1
said	1
Sancho;	1
“If	1
this	1
charitable	1
work	1
were	1
to	1
be	1
done	1
for	1
the	1
sake	1
of	1
damsels	1
in	1
confinement	1
or	1
charity-girls,	1
a	1
man	1
might	1
expose	1
himself	1
to	1
some	1
hardships;	1
but	1
to	1
bear	1
it	1
for	1
the	1
sake	1
of	1
stripping	1
beards	1
off	1
duennas!	1
Devil	1
take	1
it!	1
I’d	1
sooner	1
see	1
them	1
all	1
bearded,	1
from	1
the	1
highest	1
to	1
the	1
lowest,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
most	1
prudish	1
to	1
the	1
most	1
affected.”	1
“You	1
are	1
very	1
hard	1
on	1
duennas,	1
Sancho	1
my	1
friend,”	1
said	1
the	1
duchess;	1
“you	1
incline	1
very	1
much	1
to	1
the	1
opinion	1
of	1
the	1
Toledo	1
apothecary.	1
But	1
indeed	1
you	1
are	1
wrong;	1
there	1
are	1
duennas	1
in	1
my	1
house	1
that	1
may	1
serve	1
as	1
patterns	1
of	1
duennas;	1
and	1
here	1
is	1
my	1
Doña	1
Rodriguez,	1
who	1
will	1
not	1
allow	1
me	1
to	1
say	1
otherwise.”	1
“Your	1
excellence	1
may	1
say	1
it	1
if	1
you	1
like,”	1
said	1
the	1
Rodriguez;	1
“for	1
God	1
knows	1
the	1
truth	1
of	1
everything;	1
and	1
whether	1
we	1
duennas	1
are	1
good	1
or	1
bad,	1
bearded	1
or	1
smooth,	1
we	1
are	1
our	1
mothers’	1
daughters	1
like	1
other	1
women;	1
and	1
as	1
God	1
sent	1
us	1
into	1
the	1
world,	1
he	1
knows	1
why	1
he	1
did,	1
and	1
on	1
his	1
mercy	1
I	1
rely,	1
and	1
not	1
on	1
anybody’s	1
beard.”	1
“Well,	1
Señora	1
Rodriguez,	1
Señora	1
Trifaldi,	1
and	1
present	1
company,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“I	1
trust	1
in	1
Heaven	1
that	1
it	1
will	1
look	1
with	1
kindly	1
eyes	1
upon	1
your	1
troubles,	1
for	1
Sancho	1
will	1
do	1
as	1
I	1
bid	1
him.	1
Only	1
let	1
Clavileño	1
come	1
and	1
let	1
me	1
find	1
myself	1
face	1
to	1
face	1
with	1
Malambruno,	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
certain	1
no	1
razor	1
will	1
shave	1
you	1
more	1
easily	1
than	1
my	1
sword	1
shall	1
shave	1
Malambruno’s	1
head	1
off	1
his	1
shoulders;	1
for	1
‘God	1
bears	1
with	1
the	1
wicked,	1
but	1
not	1
for	1
ever.”	1
“Ah!”	1
exclaimed	1
the	1
Distressed	1
One	1
at	1
this,	1
“may	1
all	1
the	1
stars	1
of	1
the	1
celestial	1
regions	1
look	1
down	1
upon	1
your	1
greatness	1
with	1
benign	1
eyes,	1
valiant	1
knight,	1
and	1
shed	1
every	1
prosperity	1
and	1
valour	1
upon	1
your	1
heart,	1
that	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
the	1
shield	1
and	1
safeguard	1
of	1
the	1
abused	1
and	1
downtrodden	1
race	1
of	1
duennas,	1
detested	1
by	1
apothecaries,	1
sneered	1
at	1
by	1
squires,	1
and	1
made	1
game	1
of	1
by	1
pages.	1
Ill	1
betide	1
the	1
jade	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
flower	1
of	1
her	1
youth	1
would	1
not	1
sooner	1
become	1
a	1
nun	1
than	1
a	1
duenna!	1
Unfortunate	1
beings	1
that	1
we	1
are,	1
we	1
duennas!	1
Though	1
we	1
may	1
be	1
descended	1
in	1
the	1
direct	1
male	1
line	1
from	1
Hector	1
of	1
Troy	1
himself,	1
our	1
mistresses	1
never	1
fail	1
to	1
address	1
us	1
as	1
‘you’	1
if	1
they	1
think	1
it	1
makes	1
queens	1
of	1
them.	1
O	1
giant	1
Malambruno,	1
though	1
thou	1
art	1
an	1
enchanter,	1
thou	1
art	1
true	1
to	1
thy	1
promises.	1
Send	1
us	1
now	1
the	1
peerless	1
Clavileño,	1
that	1
our	1
misfortune	1
may	1
be	1
brought	1
to	1
an	1
end;	1
for	1
if	1
the	1
hot	1
weather	1
sets	1
in	1
and	1
these	1
beards	1
of	1
ours	1
are	1
still	1
there,	1
alas	1
for	1
our	1
lot!”	1
The	1
Trifaldi	1
said	1
this	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
pathetic	1
way	1
that	1
she	1
drew	1
tears	1
from	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
all	1
and	1
even	1
Sancho’s	1
filled	1
up;	1
and	1
he	1
resolved	1
in	1
his	1
heart	1
to	1
accompany	1
his	1
master	1
to	1
the	1
uttermost	1
ends	1
of	1
the	1
earth,	1
if	1
so	1
be	1
the	1
removal	1
of	1
the	1
wool	1
from	1
those	1
venerable	1
countenances	1
depended	1
upon	1
it.	1

And	1
now	1
night	1
came,	1
and	1
with	1
it	1
the	1
appointed	1
time	1
for	1
the	1
arrival	1
of	1
the	1
famous	1
horse	1
Clavileño,	1
the	1
non-appearance	1
of	1
which	1
was	1
already	1
beginning	1
to	1
make	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
uneasy,	1
for	1
it	1
struck	1
him	1
that,	1
as	1
Malambruno	1
was	1
so	1
long	1
about	1
sending	1
it,	1
either	1
he	1
himself	1
was	1
not	1
the	1
knight	1
for	1
whom	1
the	1
adventure	1
was	1
reserved,	1
or	1
else	1
Malambruno	1
did	1
not	1
dare	1
to	1
meet	1
him	1
in	1
single	1
combat.	1
But	1
lo!	1
suddenly	1
there	1
came	1
into	1
the	1
garden	1
four	1
wild-men	1
all	1
clad	1
in	1
green	1
ivy	1
bearing	1
on	1
their	1
shoulders	1
a	1
great	1
wooden	1
horse.	1
They	1
placed	1
it	1
on	1
its	1
feet	1
on	1
the	1
ground,	1
and	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
wild-men	1
said,	1
“Let	1
the	1
knight	1
who	1
has	1
heart	1
for	1
it	1
mount	1
this	1
machine.”	1
Here	1
Sancho	1
exclaimed,	1
“I	1
don’t	1
mount,	1
for	1
neither	1
have	1
I	1
the	1
heart	1
nor	1
am	1
I	1
a	1
knight.”	1
“And	1
let	1
the	1
squire,	1
if	1
he	1
has	1
one,”	1
continued	1
the	1
wild-man,	1
“take	1
his	1
seat	1
on	1
the	1
croup,	1
and	1
let	1
him	1
trust	1
the	1
valiant	1
Malambruno;	1
for	1
by	1
no	1
sword	1
save	1
his,	1
nor	1
by	1
the	1
malice	1
of	1
any	1
other,	1
shall	1
he	1
be	1
assailed.	1
It	1
is	1
but	1
to	1
turn	1
this	1
peg	1
the	1
horse	1
has	1
in	1
his	1
neck,	1
and	1
he	1
will	1
bear	1
them	1
through	1
the	1
air	1
to	1
where	1
Malambruno	1
awaits	1
them;	1
but	1
lest	1
the	1
vast	1
elevation	1
of	1
their	1
course	1
should	1
make	1
them	1
giddy,	1
their	1
eyes	1
must	1
be	1
covered	1
until	1
the	1
horse	1
neighs,	1
which	1
will	1
be	1
the	1
sign	1
of	1
their	1
having	1
completed	1
their	1
journey.”	1
With	1
these	1
words,	1
leaving	1
Clavileño	1
behind	1
them,	1
they	1
retired	1
with	1
easy	1
dignity	1
the	1
way	1
they	1
came.	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
the	1
Distressed	1
One	1
saw	1
the	1
horse,	1
almost	1
in	1
tears	1
she	1
exclaimed	1
to	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“Valiant	1
knight,	1
the	1
promise	1
of	1
Malambruno	1
has	1
proved	1
trustworthy;	1
the	1
horse	1
has	1
come,	1
our	1
beards	1
are	1
growing,	1
and	1
by	1
every	1
hair	1
in	1
them	1
all	1
of	1
us	1
implore	1
thee	1
to	1
shave	1
and	1
shear	1
us,	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
only	1
mounting	1
him	1
with	1
thy	1
squire	1
and	1
making	1
a	1
happy	1
beginning	1
with	1
your	1
new	1
journey.”	1
“That	1
I	1
will,	1
Señora	1
Countess	1
Trifaldi,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“most	1
gladly	1
and	1
with	1
right	1
goodwill,	1
without	1
stopping	1
to	1
take	1
a	1
cushion	1
or	1
put	1
on	1
my	1
spurs,	1
so	1
as	1
not	1
to	1
lose	1
time,	1
such	1
is	1
my	1
desire	1
to	1
see	1
you	1
and	1
all	1
these	1
duennas	1
shaved	1
clean.”	1
“That	1
I	1
won’t,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“with	1
good-will	1
or	1
bad-will,	1
or	1
any	1
way	1
at	1
all;	1
and	1
if	1
this	1
shaving	1
can’t	1
be	1
done	1
without	1
my	1
mounting	1
on	1
the	1
croup,	1
my	1
master	1
had	1
better	1
look	1
out	1
for	1
another	1
squire	1
to	1
go	1
with	1
him,	1
and	1
these	1
ladies	1
for	1
some	1
other	1
way	1
of	1
making	1
their	1
faces	1
smooth;	1
I’m	1
no	1
witch	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
taste	1
for	1
travelling	1
through	1
the	1
air.	1
What	1
would	1
my	1
islanders	1
say	1
when	1
they	1
heard	1
their	1
governor	1
was	1
going,	1
strolling	1
about	1
on	1
the	1
winds?	1
And	1
another	1
thing,	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
three	1
thousand	1
and	1
odd	1
leagues	1
from	1
this	1
to	1
Kandy,	1
if	1
the	1
horse	1
tires,	1
or	1
the	1
giant	1
takes	1
huff,	1
we’ll	1
be	1
half	1
a	1
dozen	1
years	1
getting	1
back,	1
and	1
there	1
won’t	1
be	1
isle	1
or	1
island	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
that	1
will	1
know	1
me:	1
and	1
so,	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
common	1
saying	1
‘in	1

there’s	1
danger,’	1
and	1
‘when	1
they	1
offer	1
thee	1
a	1
heifer	1
run	1
with	1
a	1
halter,’	1
these	1
ladies’	1

must	1
excuse	1
me;	1
‘Saint	1
Peter	1
is	1
very	1
well	1
in	1
Rome;’	1
I	1
mean	1
I	1
am	1
very	1
well	1
in	1
this	1
house	1
where	1
so	1
much	1
is	1
made	1
of	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
hope	1
for	1
such	1
a	1
good	1
thing	1
from	1
the	1
master	1
as	1
to	1
see	1
myself	1
a	1

“Friend	1
Sancho,”	1
said	1
the	1
duke	1
at	1
this,	1
“the	1
island	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
promised	1
you	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
moving	1
one,	1
or	1
one	1
that	1
will	1
run	1
away;	1
it	1
has	1
roots	1
so	1
deeply	1
buried	1
in	1
the	1
bowels	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
that	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
no	1
easy	1
matter	1
to	1
pluck	1
it	1
up	1
or	1
shift	1
it	1
from	1
where	1
it	1
is;	1
you	1
know	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
I	1
do	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
sort	1
of	1
office	1
of	1
any	1
importance	1
that	1
is	1
not	1
obtained	1
by	1
a	1
bribe	1
of	1
some	1
kind,	1
great	1
or	1
small;	1
well	1
then,	1
that	1
which	1
I	1
look	1
to	1
receive	1
for	1
this	1
government	1
is	1
that	1
you	1
go	1
with	1
your	1
master	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
and	1
bring	1
this	1
memorable	1
adventure	1
to	1
a	1
conclusion;	1
and	1
whether	1
you	1
return	1
on	1
Clavileño	1
as	1
quickly	1
as	1
his	1
speed	1
seems	1
to	1
promise,	1
or	1
adverse	1
fortune	1
brings	1
you	1
back	1
on	1
foot	1
travelling	1
as	1
a	1
pilgrim	1
from	1
hostel	1
to	1
hostel	1
and	1
from	1
inn	1
to	1
inn,	1
you	1
will	1
always	1
find	1
your	1
island	1
on	1
your	1
return	1
where	1
you	1
left	1
it,	1
and	1
your	1
islanders	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
eagerness	1
they	1
have	1
always	1
had	1
to	1
receive	1
you	1
as	1
their	1
governor,	1
and	1
my	1
good-will	1
will	1
remain	1
the	1
same;	1
doubt	1
not	1
the	1
truth	1
of	1
this,	1
Señor	1
Sancho,	1
for	1
that	1
would	1
be	1
grievously	1
wronging	1
my	1
disposition	1
to	1
serve	1
you.”	1
“Say	1
no	1
more,	1
señor,”	1
said	1
Sancho;	1
“I	1
am	1
a	1
poor	1
squire	1
and	1
not	1
equal	1
to	1
carrying	1
so	1
much	1
courtesy;	1
let	1
my	1
master	1
mount;	1
bandage	1
my	1
eyes	1
and	1
commit	1
me	1
to	1
God’s	1
care,	1
and	1
tell	1
me	1
if	1
I	1
may	1
commend	1
myself	1
to	1
our	1
Lord	1
or	1
call	1
upon	1
the	1
angels	1
to	1
protect	1
me	1
when	1
we	1
go	1
towering	1
up	1
there.”	1
To	1
this	1
the	1
Trifaldi	1
made	1
answer,	1
“Sancho,	1
you	1
may	1
freely	1
commend	1
yourself	1
to	1
God	1
or	1
whom	1
you	1
will;	1
for	1
Malambruno	1
though	1
an	1
enchanter	1
is	1
a	1
Christian,	1
and	1
works	1
his	1
enchantments	1
with	1
great	1
circumspection,	1
taking	1
very	1
good	1
care	1
not	1
to	1
fall	1
out	1
with	1
anyone.”	1
“Well	1
then,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“God	1
and	1
the	1
most	1
holy	1
Trinity	1
of	1
Gaeta	1
give	1
me	1
help!”	1
“Since	1
the	1
memorable	1
adventure	1
of	1
the	1
fulling	1
mills,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“I	1
have	1
never	1
seen	1
Sancho	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
fright	1
as	1
now;	1
were	1
I	1
as	1
superstitious	1
as	1
others	1
his	1
abject	1
fear	1
would	1
cause	1
me	1
some	1
little	1
trepidation	1
of	1
spirit.	1
But	1
come	1
here,	1
Sancho,	1
for	1
with	1
the	1
leave	1
of	1
these	1
gentles	1
I	1
would	1
say	1
a	1
word	1
or	1
two	1
to	1
thee	1
in	1
private;”	1
and	1
drawing	1
Sancho	1
aside	1
among	1
the	1
trees	1
of	1
the	1
garden	1
and	1
seizing	1
both	1
his	1
hands	1
he	1
said,	1
“Thou	1
seest,	1
brother	1
Sancho,	1
the	1
long	1
journey	1
we	1
have	1
before	1
us,	1
and	1
God	1
knows	1
when	1
we	1
shall	1
return,	1
or	1
what	1
leisure	1
or	1
opportunities	1
this	1
business	1
will	1
allow	1
us;	1
I	1
wish	1
thee	1
therefore	1
to	1
retire	1
now	1
to	1
thy	1
chamber,	1
as	1
though	1
thou	1
wert	1
going	1
to	1
fetch	1
something	1
required	1
for	1
the	1
road,	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
trice	1
give	1
thyself	1
if	1
it	1
be	1
only	1
five	1
hundred	1
lashes	1
on	1
account	1
of	1
the	1
three	1
thousand	1
three	1
hundred	1
to	1
which	1
thou	1
art	1
bound;	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
all	1
to	1
the	1
good,	1
and	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
beginning	1
with	1
a	1
thing	1
is	1
to	1
have	1
it	1
half	1
finished.”	1
“By	1
God,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“but	1
your	1
worship	1
must	1
be	1
out	1
of	1
your	1
senses!	1
This	1
is	1
like	1
the	1
common	1
saying,	1
‘You	1
see	1
me	1
with	1
child,	1
and	1
you	1
want	1
me	1
a	1
virgin.’	1
Just	1
as	1
I’m	1
about	1
to	1
go	1
sitting	1
on	1
a	1
bare	1
board,	1
your	1
worship	1
would	1
have	1
me	1
score	1
my	1
backside!	1
Indeed,	1
your	1
worship	1
is	1
not	1
reasonable.	1
Let	1
us	1
be	1
off	1
to	1
shave	1
these	1
duennas;	1
and	1
on	1
our	1
return	1
I	1
promise	1
on	1
my	1
word	1
to	1
make	1
such	1
haste	1
to	1
wipe	1
off	1
all	1
that’s	1
due	1
as	1
will	1
satisfy	1
your	1
worship;	1
I	1
can’t	1
say	1
more.”	1
“Well,	1
I	1
will	1
comfort	1
myself	1
with	1
that	1
promise,	1
my	1
good	1
Sancho,”	1
replied	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“and	1
I	1
believe	1
thou	1
wilt	1
keep	1
it;	1
for	1
indeed	1
though	1
stupid	1
thou	1
art	1
veracious.”	1
“I’m	1
not	1
voracious,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“only	1
peckish;	1
but	1
even	1
if	1
I	1
was	1
a	1
little,	1
still	1
I’d	1
keep	1
my	1
word.”	1
With	1
this	1
they	1
went	1
back	1
to	1
mount	1
Clavileño,	1
and	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
about	1
to	1
do	1
so	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
said,	1
“Cover	1
thine	1
eyes,	1
Sancho,	1
and	1
mount;	1
for	1
one	1
who	1
sends	1
for	1
us	1
from	1
lands	1
so	1
far	1
distant	1
cannot	1
mean	1
to	1
deceive	1
us	1
for	1
the	1
sake	1
of	1
the	1
paltry	1
glory	1
to	1
be	1
derived	1
from	1
deceiving	1
persons	1
who	1
trust	1
in	1
him;	1
though	1
all	1
should	1
turn	1
out	1
the	1
contrary	1
of	1
what	1
I	1
hope,	1
no	1
malice	1
will	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
dim	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
having	1
undertaken	1
this	1
exploit.”	1
“Let	1
us	1
be	1
off,	1
señor,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“for	1
I	1
have	1
taken	1
the	1
beards	1
and	1
tears	1
of	1
these	1
ladies	1
deeply	1
to	1
heart,	1
and	1
I	1
shan’t	1
eat	1
a	1
bit	1
to	1
relish	1
it	1
until	1
I	1
have	1
seen	1
them	1
restored	1
to	1
their	1
former	1
smoothness.	1
Mount,	1
your	1
worship,	1
and	1
blindfold	1
yourself,	1
for	1
if	1
I	1
am	1
to	1
go	1
on	1
the	1
croup,	1
it	1
is	1
plain	1
the	1
rider	1
in	1
the	1
saddle	1
must	1
mount	1
first.”	1
“That	1
is	1
true,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
and,	1
taking	1
a	1
handkerchief	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
pocket,	1
he	1
begged	1
the	1
Distressed	1
One	1
to	1
bandage	1
his	1
eyes	1
very	1
carefully;	1
but	1
after	1
having	1
them	1
bandaged	1
he	1
uncovered	1
them	1
again,	1
saying,	1
“If	1
my	1
memory	1
does	1
not	1
deceive	1
me,	1
I	1
have	1
read	1
in	1
Virgil	1
of	1
the	1
Palladium	1
of	1
Troy,	1
a	1
wooden	1
horse	1
the	1
Greeks	1
offered	1
to	1
the	1
goddess	1
Pallas,	1
which	1
was	1
big	1
with	1
armed	1
knights,	1
who	1
were	1
afterwards	1
the	1
destruction	1
of	1
Troy;	1
so	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
as	1
well	1
to	1
see,	1
first	1
of	1
all,	1
what	1
Clavileño	1
has	1
in	1
his	1
stomach.”	1
“There	1
is	1
no	1
occasion,”	1
said	1
the	1
Distressed	1
One;	1
“I	1
will	1
be	1
bail	1
for	1
him,	1
and	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
Malambruno	1
has	1
nothing	1
tricky	1
or	1
treacherous	1
about	1
him;	1
you	1
may	1
mount	1
without	1
any	1
fear,	1
Señor	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
on	1
my	1
head	1
be	1
it	1
if	1
any	1
harm	1
befalls	1
you.”	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
thought	1
that	1
to	1
say	1
anything	1
further	1
with	1
regard	1
to	1
his	1
safety	1
would	1
be	1
putting	1
his	1
courage	1
in	1
an	1
unfavourable	1
light;	1
and	1
so,	1
without	1
more	1
words,	1
he	1
mounted	1
Clavileño,	1
and	1
tried	1
the	1
peg,	1
which	1
turned	1
easily;	1
and	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
no	1
stirrups	1
and	1
his	1
legs	1
hung	1
down,	1
he	1
looked	1
like	1
nothing	1
so	1
much	1
as	1
a	1
figure	1
in	1
some	1
Roman	1
triumph	1
painted	1
or	1
embroidered	1
on	1
a	1
Flemish	1
tapestry.	1
Much	1
against	1
the	1
grain,	1
and	1
very	1
slowly,	1
Sancho	1
proceeded	1
to	1
mount,	1
and,	1
after	1
settling	1
himself	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
he	1
could	1
on	1
the	1
croup,	1
found	1
it	1
rather	1
hard,	1
and	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
soft,	1
and	1
asked	1
the	1
duke	1
if	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
possible	1
to	1
oblige	1
him	1
with	1
a	1
pad	1
of	1
some	1
kind,	1
or	1
a	1
cushion;	1
even	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
off	1
the	1
couch	1
of	1
his	1
lady	1
the	1
duchess,	1
or	1
the	1
bed	1
of	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
pages;	1
as	1
the	1
haunches	1
of	1
that	1
horse	1
were	1
more	1
like	1
marble	1
than	1
wood.	1
On	1
this	1
the	1
Trifaldi	1
observed	1
that	1
Clavileño	1
would	1
not	1
bear	1
any	1
kind	1
of	1
harness	1
or	1
trappings,	1
and	1
that	1
his	1
best	1
plan	1
would	1
be	1
to	1
sit	1
sideways	1
like	1
a	1
woman,	1
as	1
in	1
that	1
way	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
feel	1
the	1
hardness	1
so	1
much.	1
Sancho	1
did	1
so,	1
and,	1
bidding	1
them	1
farewell,	1
allowed	1
his	1
eyes	1
to	1
be	1
bandaged,	1
but	1
immediately	1
afterwards	1
uncovered	1
them	1
again,	1
and	1
looking	1
tenderly	1
and	1
tearfully	1
on	1
those	1
in	1
the	1
garden,	1
bade	1
them	1
help	1
him	1
in	1
his	1
present	1
strait	1
with	1
plenty	1
of	1
Paternosters	1
and	1
Ave	1
Marias,	1
that	1
God	1
might	1
provide	1
someone	1
to	1
say	1
as	1
many	1
for	1
them,	1
whenever	1
they	1
found	1
themselves	1
in	1
a	1
similar	1
emergency.	1
At	1
this	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
exclaimed,	1
“Art	1
thou	1
on	1
the	1
gallows,	1
thief,	1
or	1
at	1
thy	1
last	1
moment,	1
to	1
use	1
pitiful	1
entreaties	1
of	1
that	1
sort?	1
Cowardly,	1
spiritless	1
creature,	1
art	1
thou	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
very	1
place	1
the	1
fair	1
Magalona	1
occupied,	1
and	1
from	1
which	1
she	1
descended,	1
not	1
into	1
the	1
grave,	1
but	1
to	1
become	1
Queen	1
of	1
France;	1
unless	1
the	1
histories	1
lie?	1
And	1
I	1
who	1
am	1
here	1
beside	1
thee,	1
may	1
I	1
not	1
put	1
myself	1
on	1
a	1
par	1
with	1
the	1
valiant	1
Pierres,	1
who	1
pressed	1
this	1
very	1
spot	1
that	1
I	1
now	1
press?	1
Cover	1
thine	1
eyes,	1
cover	1
thine	1
eyes,	1
abject	1
animal,	1
and	1
let	1
not	1
thy	1
fear	1
escape	1
thy	1
lips,	1
at	1
least	1
in	1
my	1
presence.”	1
“Blindfold	1
me,”	1
said	1
Sancho;	1
“as	1
you	1
won’t	1
let	1
me	1
commend	1
myself	1
or	1
be	1
commended	1
to	1
God,	1
is	1
it	1
any	1
wonder	1
if	1
I	1
am	1
afraid	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
region	1
of	1
devils	1
about	1
here	1
that	1
will	1
carry	1
us	1
off	1
to	1
Peralvillo?”	1
They	1
were	1
then	1
blindfolded,	1
and	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
finding	1
himself	1
settled	1
to	1
his	1
satisfaction,	1
felt	1
for	1
the	1
peg,	1
and	1
the	1
instant	1
he	1
placed	1
his	1
fingers	1
on	1
it,	1
all	1
the	1
duennas	1
and	1
all	1
who	1
stood	1
by	1
lifted	1
up	1
their	1
voices	1
exclaiming,	1
“God	1
guide	1
thee,	1
valiant	1
knight!	1
God	1
be	1
with	1
thee,	1
intrepid	1
squire!	1
Now,	1
now	1
ye	1
go	1
cleaving	1
the	1
air	1
more	1
swiftly	1
than	1
an	1
arrow!	1
Now	1
ye	1
begin	1
to	1
amaze	1
and	1
astonish	1
all	1
who	1
are	1
gazing	1
at	1
you	1
from	1
the	1
earth!	1
Take	1
care	1
not	1
to	1
wobble	1
about,	1
valiant	1
Sancho!	1
Mind	1
thou	1
fall	1
not,	1
for	1
thy	1
fall	1
will	1
be	1
worse	1
than	1
that	1
rash	1
youth’s	1
who	1
tried	1
to	1
steer	1
the	1
chariot	1
of	1
his	1
father	1
the	1
Sun!”	1
As	1
Sancho	1
heard	1
the	1
voices,	1
clinging	1
tightly	1
to	1
his	1
master	1
and	1
winding	1
his	1
arms	1
round	1
him,	1
he	1
said,	1
“Señor,	1
how	1
do	1
they	1
make	1
out	1
we	1
are	1
going	1
up	1
so	1
high,	1
if	1
their	1
voices	1
reach	1
us	1
here	1
and	1
they	1
seem	1
to	1
be	1
speaking	1
quite	1
close	1
to	1
us?”	1
“Don’t	1
mind	1
that,	1
Sancho,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
“for	1
as	1
affairs	1
of	1
this	1
sort,	1
and	1
flights	1
like	1
this	1
are	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
common	1
course	1
of	1
things,	1
you	1
can	1
see	1
and	1
hear	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
you	1
like	1
a	1
thousand	1
leagues	1
off;	1
but	1
don’t	1
squeeze	1
me	1
so	1
tight	1
or	1
thou	1
wilt	1
upset	1
me;	1
and	1
really	1
I	1
know	1
not	1
what	1
thou	1
hast	1
to	1
be	1
uneasy	1
or	1
frightened	1
at,	1
for	1
I	1
can	1
safely	1
swear	1
I	1
never	1
mounted	1
a	1
smoother-going	1
steed	1
all	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
my	1
life;	1
one	1
would	1
fancy	1
we	1
never	1
stirred	1
from	1
one	1
place.	1
Banish	1
fear,	1
my	1
friend,	1
for	1
indeed	1
everything	1
is	1
going	1
as	1
it	1
ought,	1
and	1
we	1
have	1
the	1
wind	1
astern.”	1
“That’s	1
true,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“for	1
such	1
a	1
strong	1
wind	1
comes	1
against	1
me	1
on	1
this	1
side,	1
that	1
it	1
seems	1
as	1
if	1
people	1
were	1
blowing	1
on	1
me	1
with	1
a	1
thousand	1
pair	1
of	1
bellows;”	1
which	1
was	1
the	1
case;	1
they	1
were	1
puffing	1
at	1
him	1
with	1
a	1
great	1
pair	1
of	1
bellows;	1
for	1
the	1
whole	1
adventure	1
was	1
so	1
well	1
planned	1
by	1
the	1
duke,	1
the	1
duchess,	1
and	1
their	1
majordomo,	1
that	1
nothing	1
was	1
omitted	1
to	1
make	1
it	1
perfectly	1
successful.	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
now,	1
feeling	1
the	1
blast,	1
said,	1
“Beyond	1
a	1
doubt,	1
Sancho,	1
we	1
must	1
have	1
already	1
reached	1
the	1
second	1
region	1
of	1
the	1
air,	1
where	1
the	1
hail	1
and	1
snow	1
are	1
generated;	1
the	1
thunder,	1
the	1
lightning,	1
and	1
the	1
thunderbolts	1
are	1
engendered	1
in	1
the	1
third	1
region,	1
and	1
if	1
we	1
go	1
on	1
ascending	1
at	1
this	1
rate,	1
we	1
shall	1
shortly	1
plunge	1
into	1
the	1
region	1
of	1
fire,	1
and	1
I	1
know	1
not	1
how	1
to	1
regulate	1
this	1
peg,	1
so	1
as	1
not	1
to	1
mount	1
up	1
where	1
we	1
shall	1
be	1
burned.”	1
And	1
now	1
they	1
began	1
to	1
warm	1
their	1
faces,	1
from	1
a	1
distance,	1
with	1
tow	1
that	1
could	1
be	1
easily	1
set	1
on	1
fire	1
and	1
extinguished	1
again,	1
fixed	1
on	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
a	1
cane.	1
On	1
feeling	1
the	1
heat	1
Sancho	1
said,	1
“May	1
I	1
die	1
if	1
we	1
are	1
not	1
already	1
in	1
that	1
fire	1
place,	1
or	1
very	1
near	1
it,	1
for	1
a	1
good	1
part	1
of	1
my	1
beard	1
has	1
been	1
singed,	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
a	1
mind,	1
señor,	1
to	1
uncover	1
and	1
see	1
whereabouts	1
we	1
are.”	1
“Do	1
nothing	1
of	1
the	1
kind,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
“remember	1
the	1
true	1
story	1
of	1
the	1
licentiate	1
Torralva	1
that	1
the	1
devils	1
carried	1
flying	1
through	1
the	1
air	1
riding	1
on	1
a	1
stick	1
with	1
his	1
eyes	1
shut;	1
who	1
in	1
twelve	1
hours	1
reached	1
Rome	1
and	1
dismounted	1
at	1
Torre	1
di	1
Nona,	1
which	1
is	1
a	1
street	1
of	1
the	1
city,	1
and	1
saw	1
the	1
whole	1
sack	1
and	1
storming	1
and	1
the	1
death	1
of	1
Bourbon,	1
and	1
was	1
back	1
in	1
Madrid	1
the	1
next	1
morning,	1
where	1
he	1
gave	1
an	1
account	1
of	1
all	1
he	1
had	1
seen;	1
and	1
he	1
said	1
moreover	1
that	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
going	1
through	1
the	1
air,	1
the	1
devil	1
bade	1
him	1
open	1
his	1
eyes,	1
and	1
he	1
did	1
so,	1
and	1
saw	1
himself	1
so	1
near	1
the	1
body	1
of	1
the	1
moon,	1
so	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
him,	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
have	1
laid	1
hold	1
of	1
it	1
with	1
his	1
hand,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
dare	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
the	1
earth	1
lest	1
he	1
should	1
be	1
seized	1
with	1
giddiness.	1
So	1
that,	1
Sancho,	1
it	1
will	1
not	1
do	1
for	1
us	1
to	1
uncover	1
ourselves,	1
for	1
he	1
who	1
has	1
us	1
in	1
charge	1
will	1
be	1
responsible	1
for	1
us;	1
and	1
perhaps	1
we	1
are	1
gaining	1
an	1
altitude	1
and	1
mounting	1
up	1
to	1
enable	1
us	1
to	1
descend	1
at	1
one	1
swoop	1
on	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
Kandy,	1
as	1
the	1
saker	1
or	1
falcon	1
does	1
on	1
the	1
heron,	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
seize	1
it	1
however	1
high	1
it	1
may	1
soar;	1
and	1
though	1
it	1
seems	1
to	1
us	1
not	1
half	1
an	1
hour	1
since	1
we	1
left	1
the	1
garden,	1
believe	1
me	1
we	1
must	1
have	1
travelled	1
a	1
great	1
distance.”	1
“I	1
don’t	1
know	1
how	1
that	1
may	1
be,”	1
said	1
Sancho;	1
“all	1
I	1
know	1
is	1
that	1
if	1
the	1
Señora	1
Magallanes	1
or	1
Magalona	1
was	1
satisfied	1
with	1
this	1
croup,	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
been	1
very	1
tender	1
of	1
flesh.”	1
The	1
duke,	1
the	1
duchess,	1
and	1
all	1
in	1
the	1
garden	1
were	1
listening	1
to	1
the	1
conversation	1
of	1
the	1
two	1
heroes,	1
and	1
were	1
beyond	1
measure	1
amused	1
by	1
it;	1
and	1
now,	1
desirous	1
of	1
putting	1
a	1
finishing	1
touch	1
to	1
this	1
rare	1
and	1
well-contrived	1
adventure,	1
they	1
applied	1
a	1
light	1
to	1
Clavileño’s	1
tail	1
with	1
some	1
tow,	1
and	1
the	1
horse,	1
being	1
full	1
of	1
squibs	1
and	1
crackers,	1
immediately	1
blew	1
up	1
with	1
a	1
prodigious	1
noise,	1
and	1
brought	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
and	1
Sancho	1
Panza	1
to	1
the	1
ground	1
half	1
singed.	1
By	1
this	1
time	1
the	1
bearded	1
band	1
of	1
duennas,	1
the	1
Trifaldi	1
and	1
all,	1
had	1
vanished	1
from	1
the	1
garden,	1
and	1
those	1
that	1
remained	1
lay	1
stretched	1
on	1
the	1
ground	1
as	1
if	1
in	1
a	1
swoon.	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
and	1
Sancho	1
got	1
up	1
rather	1
shaken,	1
and,	1
looking	1
about	1
them,	1
were	1
filled	1
with	1
amazement	1
at	1
finding	1
themselves	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
garden	1
from	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
started,	1
and	1
seeing	1
such	1
a	1
number	1
of	1
people	1
stretched	1
on	1
the	1
ground;	1
and	1
their	1
astonishment	1
was	1
increased	1
when	1
at	1
one	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
garden	1
they	1
perceived	1
a	1
tall	1
lance	1
planted	1
in	1
the	1
ground,	1
and	1
hanging	1
from	1
it	1
by	1
two	1
cords	1
of	1
green	1
silk	1
a	1
smooth	1
white	1
parchment	1
on	1
which	1
there	1
was	1
the	1
following	1
inscription	1
in	1
large	1
gold	1
letters:	1
“The	1
illustrious	1
knight	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
of	1
La	1
Mancha	1
has,	1
by	1
merely	1
attempting	1
it,	1
finished	1
and	1
concluded	1
the	1
adventure	1
of	1
the	1
Countess	1
Trifaldi,	1
otherwise	1
called	1
the	1
Distressed	1
Duenna;	1
Malambruno	1
is	1
now	1
satisfied	1
on	1
every	1
point,	1
the	1
chins	1
of	1
the	1
duennas	1
are	1
now	1
smooth	1
and	1
clean,	1
and	1
King	1
Don	1
Clavijo	1
and	1
Queen	1
Antonomasia	1
in	1
their	1
original	1
form;	1
and	1
when	1
the	1
squirely	1
flagellation	1
shall	1
have	1
been	1
completed,	1
the	1
white	1
dove	1
shall	1
find	1
herself	1
delivered	1
from	1
the	1
pestiferous	1
gerfalcons	1
that	1
persecute	1
her,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
arms	1
of	1
her	1
beloved	1
mate;	1
for	1
such	1
is	1
the	1
decree	1
of	1
the	1
sage	1
Merlin,	1
arch-enchanter	1
of	1
enchanters.”	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
had	1
read	1
the	1
inscription	1
on	1
the	1
parchment	1
he	1
perceived	1
clearly	1
that	1
it	1
referred	1
to	1
the	1
disenchantment	1
of	1
Dulcinea,	1
and	1
returning	1
hearty	1
thanks	1
to	1
heaven	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
with	1
so	1
little	1
danger	1
achieved	1
so	1
grand	1
an	1
exploit	1
as	1
to	1
restore	1
to	1
their	1
former	1
complexion	1
the	1
countenances	1
of	1
those	1
venerable	1
duennas,	1
he	1
advanced	1
towards	1
the	1
duke	1
and	1
duchess,	1
who	1
had	1
not	1
yet	1
come	1
to	1
themselves,	1
and	1
taking	1
the	1
duke	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
he	1
said,	1
“Be	1
of	1
good	1
cheer,	1
worthy	1
sir,	1
be	1
of	1
good	1
cheer;	1
it’s	1
nothing	1
at	1
all;	1
the	1
adventure	1
is	1
now	1
over	1
and	1
without	1
any	1
harm	1
done,	1
as	1
the	1
inscription	1
fixed	1
on	1
this	1
post	1
shows	1
plainly.”	1
The	1
duke	1
came	1
to	1
himself	1
slowly	1
and	1
like	1
one	1
recovering	1
consciousness	1
after	1
a	1
heavy	1
sleep,	1
and	1
the	1
duchess	1
and	1
all	1
who	1
had	1
fallen	1
prostrate	1
about	1
the	1
garden	1
did	1
the	1
same,	1
with	1
such	1
demonstrations	1
of	1
wonder	1
and	1
amazement	1
that	1
they	1
would	1
have	1
almost	1
persuaded	1
one	1
that	1
what	1
they	1
pretended	1
so	1
adroitly	1
in	1
jest	1
had	1
happened	1
to	1
them	1
in	1
reality.	1
The	1
duke	1
read	1
the	1
placard	1
with	1
half-shut	1
eyes,	1
and	1
then	1
ran	1
to	1
embrace	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
with	1
open	1
arms,	1
declaring	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
best	1
knight	1
that	1
had	1
ever	1
been	1
seen	1
in	1
any	1
age.	1
Sancho	1
kept	1
looking	1
about	1
for	1
the	1
Distressed	1
One,	1
to	1
see	1
what	1
her	1
face	1
was	1
like	1
without	1
the	1
beard,	1
and	1
if	1
she	1
was	1
as	1
fair	1
as	1
her	1
elegant	1
person	1
promised;	1
but	1
they	1
told	1
him	1
that,	1
the	1
instant	1
Clavileño	1
descended	1
flaming	1
through	1
the	1
air	1
and	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
ground,	1
the	1
whole	1
band	1
of	1
duennas	1
with	1
the	1
Trifaldi	1
vanished,	1
and	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
already	1
shaved	1
and	1
without	1
a	1
stump	1
left.	1
The	1
duchess	1
asked	1
Sancho	1
how	1
he	1
had	1
fared	1
on	1
that	1
long	1
journey,	1
to	1
which	1
Sancho	1
replied,	1
“I	1
felt,	1
señora,	1
that	1
we	1
were	1
flying	1
through	1
the	1
region	1
of	1
fire,	1
as	1
my	1
master	1
told	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
wanted	1
to	1
uncover	1
my	1
eyes	1
for	1
a	1
bit;	1
but	1
my	1
master,	1
when	1
I	1
asked	1
leave	1
to	1
uncover	1
myself,	1
would	1
not	1
let	1
me;	1
but	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
a	1
little	1
bit	1
of	1
curiosity	1
about	1
me,	1
and	1
a	1
desire	1
to	1
know	1
what	1
is	1
forbidden	1
and	1
kept	1
from	1
me,	1
quietly	1
and	1
without	1
anyone	1
seeing	1
me	1
I	1
drew	1
aside	1
the	1
handkerchief	1
covering	1
my	1
eyes	1
ever	1
so	1
little,	1
close	1
to	1
my	1
nose,	1
and	1
from	1
underneath	1
looked	1
towards	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
me	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
altogether	1
no	1
bigger	1
than	1
a	1
grain	1
of	1
mustard	1
seed,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
men	1
walking	1
on	1
it	1
were	1
little	1
bigger	1
than	1
hazel	1
nuts;	1
so	1
you	1
may	1
see	1
how	1
high	1
we	1
must	1
have	1
got	1
to	1
then.”	1
To	1
this	1
the	1
duchess	1
said,	1
“Sancho,	1
my	1
friend,	1
mind	1
what	1
you	1
are	1
saying;	1
it	1
seems	1
you	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
seen	1
the	1
earth,	1
but	1
only	1
the	1
men	1
walking	1
on	1
it;	1
for	1
if	1
the	1
earth	1
looked	1
to	1
you	1
like	1
a	1
grain	1
of	1
mustard	1
seed,	1
and	1
each	1
man	1
like	1
a	1
hazel	1
nut,	1
one	1
man	1
alone	1
would	1
have	1
covered	1
the	1
whole	1
earth.”	1
“That	1
is	1
true,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“but	1
for	1
all	1
that	1
I	1
got	1
a	1
glimpse	1
of	1
a	1
bit	1
of	1
one	1
side	1
of	1
it,	1
and	1
saw	1
it	1
all.”	1
“Take	1
care,	1
Sancho,”	1
said	1
the	1
duchess,	1
“with	1
a	1
bit	1
of	1
one	1
side	1
one	1
does	1
not	1
see	1
the	1
whole	1
of	1
what	1
one	1
looks	1
at.”	1
“I	1
don’t	1
understand	1
that	1
way	1
of	1
looking	1
at	1
things,”	1
said	1
Sancho;	1
“I	1
only	1
know	1
that	1
your	1
ladyship	1
will	1
do	1
well	1
to	1
bear	1
in	1
mind	1
that	1
as	1
we	1
were	1
flying	1
by	1
enchantment	1
so	1
I	1
might	1
have	1
seen	1
the	1
whole	1
earth	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
men	1
by	1
enchantment	1
whatever	1
way	1
I	1
looked;	1
and	1
if	1
you	1
won’t	1
believe	1
this,	1
no	1
more	1
will	1
you	1
believe	1
that,	1
uncovering	1
myself	1
nearly	1
to	1
the	1
eyebrows,	1
I	1
saw	1
myself	1
so	1
close	1
to	1
the	1
sky	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
palm	1
and	1
a	1
half	1
between	1
me	1
and	1
it;	1
and	1
by	1
everything	1
that	1
I	1
can	1
swear	1
by,	1
señora,	1
it	1
is	1
mighty	1
great!	1
And	1
it	1
so	1
happened	1
we	1
came	1
by	1
where	1
the	1
seven	1
goats	1
are,	1
and	1
by	1
God	1
and	1
upon	1
my	1
soul,	1
as	1
in	1
my	1
youth	1
I	1
was	1
a	1
goatherd	1
in	1
my	1
own	1
country,	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
I	1
saw	1
them	1
I	1
felt	1
a	1
longing	1
to	1
be	1
among	1
them	1
for	1
a	1
little,	1
and	1
if	1
I	1
had	1
not	1
given	1
way	1
to	1
it	1
I	1
think	1
I’d	1
have	1
burst.	1
So	1
I	1
come	1
and	1
take,	1
and	1
what	1
do	1
I	1
do?	1
without	1
saying	1
anything	1
to	1
anybody,	1
not	1
even	1
to	1
my	1
master,	1
softly	1
and	1
quietly	1
I	1
got	1
down	1
from	1
Clavileño	1
and	1
amused	1
myself	1
with	1
the	1
goats—which	1
are	1
like	1
violets,	1
like	1
flowers—for	1
nigh	1
three-quarters	1
of	1
an	1
hour;	1
and	1
Clavileño	1
never	1
stirred	1
or	1
moved	1
from	1
one	1
spot.”	1
“And	1
while	1
the	1
good	1
Sancho	1
was	1
amusing	1
himself	1
with	1
the	1
goats,”	1
said	1
the	1
duke,	1
“how	1
did	1
Señor	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
amuse	1
himself?”	1
To	1
which	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
replied,	1
“As	1
all	1
these	1
things	1
and	1
such	1
like	1
occurrences	1
are	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
ordinary	1
course	1
of	1
nature,	1
it	1
is	1
no	1
wonder	1
that	1
Sancho	1
says	1
what	1
he	1
does;	1
for	1
my	1
own	1
part	1
I	1
can	1
only	1
say	1
that	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
uncover	1
my	1
eyes	1
either	1
above	1
or	1
below,	1
nor	1
did	1
I	1
see	1
sky	1
or	1
earth	1
or	1
sea	1
or	1
shore.	1
It	1
is	1
true	1
I	1
felt	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
passing	1
through	1
the	1
region	1
of	1
the	1
air,	1
and	1
even	1
that	1
I	1
touched	1
that	1
of	1
fire;	1
but	1
that	1
we	1
passed	1
farther	1
I	1
cannot	1
believe;	1
for	1
the	1
region	1
of	1
fire	1
being	1
between	1
the	1
heaven	1
of	1
the	1
moon	1
and	1
the	1
last	1
region	1
of	1
the	1
air,	1
we	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
reached	1
that	1
heaven	1
where	1
the	1
seven	1
goats	1
Sancho	1
speaks	1
of	1
are	1
without	1
being	1
burned;	1
and	1
as	1
we	1
were	1
not	1
burned,	1
either	1
Sancho	1
is	1
lying	1
or	1
Sancho	1
is	1
dreaming.”	1
“I	1
am	1
neither	1
lying	1
nor	1
dreaming,”	1
said	1
Sancho;	1
“only	1
ask	1
me	1
the	1
tokens	1
of	1
those	1
same	1
goats,	1
and	1
you’ll	1
see	1
by	1
that	1
whether	1
I’m	1
telling	1
the	1
truth	1
or	1
not.”	1
“Tell	1
us	1
them	1
then,	1
Sancho,”	1
said	1
the	1
duchess.	1
“Two	1
of	1
them,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“are	1
green,	1
two	1
blood-red,	1
two	1
blue,	1
and	1
one	1
a	1
mixture	1
of	1
all	1
colours.”	1
“An	1
odd	1
sort	1
of	1
goat,	1
that,”	1
said	1
the	1
duke;	1
“in	1
this	1
earthly	1
region	1
of	1
ours	1
we	1
have	1
no	1
such	1
colours;	1
I	1
mean	1
goats	1
of	1
such	1
colours.”	1
“That’s	1
very	1
plain,”	1
said	1
Sancho;	1
“of	1
course	1
there	1
must	1
be	1
a	1
difference	1
between	1
the	1
goats	1
of	1
heaven	1
and	1
the	1
goats	1
of	1
the	1
earth.”	1
“Tell	1
me,	1
Sancho,”	1
said	1
the	1
duke,	1
“did	1
you	1
see	1
any	1
he-goat	1
among	1
those	1
goats?”	1
“No,	1
señor,”	1
said	1
Sancho;	1
“but	1
I	1
have	1
heard	1
say	1
that	1
none	1
ever	1
passed	1
the	1
horns	1
of	1
the	1
moon.”	1
They	1
did	1
not	1
care	1
to	1
ask	1
him	1
anything	1
more	1
about	1
his	1
journey,	1
for	1
they	1
saw	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
vein	1
to	1
go	1
rambling	1
all	1
over	1
the	1
heavens	1
giving	1
an	1
account	1
of	1
everything	1
that	1
went	1
on	1
there,	1
without	1
having	1
ever	1
stirred	1
from	1
the	1
garden.	1
Such,	1
in	1
short,	1
was	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
adventure	1
of	1
the	1
Distressed	1
Duenna,	1
which	1
gave	1
the	1
duke	1
and	1
duchess	1
laughing	1
matter	1
not	1
only	1
for	1
the	1
time	1
being,	1
but	1
for	1
all	1
their	1
lives,	1
and	1
Sancho	1
something	1
to	1
talk	1
about	1
for	1
ages,	1
if	1
he	1
lived	1
so	1
long;	1
but	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
coming	1
close	1
to	1
his	1
ear,	1
said	1
to	1
him,	1
“Sancho,	1
as	1
you	1
would	1
have	1
us	1
believe	1
what	1
you	1
saw	1
in	1
heaven,	1
I	1
require	1
you	1
to	1
believe	1
me	1
as	1
to	1
what	1
I	1
saw	1
in	1
the	1
cave	1
of	1
Montesinos;	1
I	1
say	1
no	1
more.”	1

The	1
duke	1
and	1
duchess	1
were	1
so	1
well	1
pleased	1
with	1
the	1
successful	1
and	1
droll	1
result	1
of	1
the	1
adventure	1
of	1
the	1
Distressed	1
One,	1
that	1
they	1
resolved	1
to	1
carry	1
on	1
the	1
joke,	1
seeing	1
what	1
a	1
fit	1
subject	1
they	1
had	1
to	1
deal	1
with	1
for	1
making	1
it	1
all	1
pass	1
for	1
reality.	1
So	1
having	1
laid	1
their	1
plans	1
and	1
given	1
instructions	1
to	1
their	1
servants	1
and	1
vassals	1
how	1
to	1
behave	1
to	1
Sancho	1
in	1
his	1
government	1
of	1
the	1
promised	1
island,	1
the	1
next	1
day,	1
that	1
following	1
Clavileño’s	1
flight,	1
the	1
duke	1
told	1
Sancho	1
to	1
prepare	1
and	1
get	1
ready	1
to	1
go	1
and	1
be	1
governor,	1
for	1
his	1
islanders	1
were	1
already	1
looking	1
out	1
for	1
him	1
as	1
for	1
the	1
showers	1
of	1
May.	1
Sancho	1
made	1
him	1
an	1
obeisance,	1
and	1
said,	1
“Ever	1
since	1
I	1
came	1
down	1
from	1
heaven,	1
and	1
from	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
it	1
beheld	1
the	1
earth,	1
and	1
saw	1
how	1
little	1
it	1
is,	1
the	1
great	1
desire	1
I	1
had	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
governor	1
has	1
been	1
partly	1
cooled	1
in	1
me;	1
for	1
what	1
is	1
there	1
grand	1
in	1
being	1
ruler	1
on	1
a	1
grain	1
of	1
mustard	1
seed,	1
or	1
what	1
dignity	1
or	1
authority	1
in	1
governing	1
half	1
a	1
dozen	1
men	1
about	1
as	1
big	1
as	1
hazel	1
nuts;	1
for,	1
so	1
far	1
as	1
I	1
could	1
see,	1
there	1
were	1
no	1
more	1
on	1
the	1
whole	1
earth?	1
If	1
your	1
lordship	1
would	1
be	1
so	1
good	1
as	1
to	1
give	1
me	1
ever	1
so	1
small	1
a	1
bit	1
of	1
heaven,	1
were	1
it	1
no	1
more	1
than	1
half	1
a	1
league,	1
I’d	1
rather	1
have	1
it	1
than	1
the	1
best	1
island	1
in	1
the	1
world.”	1
“Recollect,	1
Sancho,”	1
said	1
the	1
duke,	1
“I	1
cannot	1
give	1
a	1
bit	1
of	1
heaven,	1
no	1
not	1
so	1
much	1
as	1
the	1
breadth	1
of	1
my	1
nail,	1
to	1
anyone;	1
rewards	1
and	1
favours	1
of	1
that	1
sort	1
are	1
reserved	1
for	1
God	1
alone.	1
What	1
I	1
can	1
give	1
I	1
give	1
you,	1
and	1
that	1
is	1
a	1
real,	1
genuine	1
island,	1
compact,	1
well	1
proportioned,	1
and	1
uncommonly	1
fertile	1
and	1
fruitful,	1
where,	1
if	1
you	1
know	1
how	1
to	1
use	1
your	1
opportunities,	1
you	1
may,	1
with	1
the	1
help	1
of	1
the	1
world’s	1
riches,	1
gain	1
those	1
of	1
heaven.”	1
“Well	1
then,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“let	1
the	1
island	1
come;	1
and	1
I’ll	1
try	1
and	1
be	1
such	1
a	1
governor,	1
that	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
scoundrels	1
I’ll	1
go	1
to	1
heaven;	1
and	1
it’s	1
not	1
from	1
any	1
craving	1
to	1
quit	1
my	1
own	1
humble	1
condition	1
or	1
better	1
myself,	1
but	1
from	1
the	1
desire	1
I	1
have	1
to	1
try	1
what	1
it	1
tastes	1
like	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
governor.”	1
“If	1
you	1
once	1
make	1
trial	1
of	1
it,	1
Sancho,”	1
said	1
the	1
duke,	1
“you’ll	1
eat	1
your	1
fingers	1
off	1
after	1
the	1
government,	1
so	1
sweet	1
a	1
thing	1
is	1
it	1
to	1
command	1
and	1
be	1
obeyed.	1
Depend	1
upon	1
it	1
when	1
your	1
master	1
comes	1
to	1
be	1
emperor	1
(as	1
he	1
will	1
beyond	1
a	1
doubt	1
from	1
the	1
course	1
his	1
affairs	1
are	1
taking),	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
no	1
easy	1
matter	1
to	1
wrest	1
the	1
dignity	1
from	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
will	1
be	1
sore	1
and	1
sorry	1
at	1
heart	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
so	1
long	1
without	1
becoming	1
one.”	1
“Señor,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“it	1
is	1
my	1
belief	1
it’s	1
a	1
good	1
thing	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
command,	1
if	1
it’s	1
only	1
over	1
a	1
drove	1
of	1
cattle.”	1
“May	1
I	1
be	1
buried	1
with	1
you,	1
Sancho,”	1
said	1
the	1
duke,	1
“but	1
you	1
know	1
everything;	1
I	1
hope	1
you	1
will	1
make	1
as	1
good	1
a	1
governor	1
as	1
your	1
sagacity	1
promises;	1
and	1
that	1
is	1
all	1
I	1
have	1
to	1
say;	1
and	1
now	1
remember	1
to-morrow	1
is	1
the	1
day	1
you	1
must	1
set	1
out	1
for	1
the	1
government	1
of	1
the	1
island,	1
and	1
this	1
evening	1
they	1
will	1
provide	1
you	1
with	1
the	1
proper	1
attire	1
for	1
you	1
to	1
wear,	1
and	1
all	1
things	1
requisite	1
for	1
your	1
departure.”	1
“Let	1
them	1
dress	1
me	1
as	1
they	1
like,”	1
said	1
Sancho;	1
“however	1
I’m	1
dressed	1
I’ll	1
be	1
Sancho	1
Panza.”	1
“That’s	1
true,”	1
said	1
the	1
duke;	1
“but	1
one’s	1
dress	1
must	1
be	1
suited	1
to	1
the	1
office	1
or	1
rank	1
one	1
holds;	1
for	1
it	1
would	1
not	1
do	1
for	1
a	1
jurist	1
to	1
dress	1
like	1
a	1
soldier,	1
or	1
a	1
soldier	1
like	1
a	1
priest.	1
You,	1
Sancho,	1
shall	1
go	1
partly	1
as	1
a	1
lawyer,	1
partly	1
as	1
a	1
captain,	1
for,	1
in	1
the	1
island	1
I	1
am	1
giving	1
you,	1
arms	1
are	1
needed	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
letters,	1
and	1
letters	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
arms.”	1
“Of	1
letters	1
I	1
know	1
but	1
little,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“for	1
I	1
don’t	1
even	1
know	1
the	1
A	1
B	1
C;	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
enough	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
have	1
the	1
Christus	1
in	1
my	1
memory	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
good	1
governor.	1
As	1
for	1
arms,	1
I’ll	1
handle	1
those	1
they	1
give	1
me	1
till	1
I	1
drop,	1
and	1
then,	1
God	1
be	1
my	1
help!”	1
“With	1
so	1
good	1
a	1
memory,”	1
said	1
the	1
duke,	1
“Sancho	1
cannot	1
go	1
wrong	1
in	1
anything.”	1
Here	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
joined	1
them;	1
and	1
learning	1
what	1
passed,	1
and	1
how	1
soon	1
Sancho	1
was	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
his	1
government,	1
he	1
with	1
the	1
duke’s	1
permission	1
took	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
hand,	1
and	1
retired	1
to	1
his	1
room	1
with	1
him	1
for	1
the	1
purpose	1
of	1
giving	1
him	1
advice	1
as	1
to	1
how	1
he	1
was	1
to	1
demean	1
himself	1
in	1
his	1
office.	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
they	1
had	1
entered	1
the	1
chamber	1
he	1
closed	1
the	1
door	1
after	1
him,	1
and	1
almost	1
by	1
force	1
made	1
Sancho	1
sit	1
down	1
beside	1
him,	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
quiet	1
tone	1
thus	1
addressed	1
him:	1
“I	1
give	1
infinite	1
thanks	1
to	1
heaven,	1
friend	1
Sancho,	1
that,	1
before	1
I	1
have	1
met	1
with	1
any	1
good	1
luck,	1
fortune	1
has	1
come	1
forward	1
to	1
meet	1
thee.	1
I	1
who	1
counted	1
upon	1
my	1
good	1
fortune	1
to	1
discharge	1
the	1
recompense	1
of	1
thy	1
services,	1
find	1
myself	1
still	1
waiting	1
for	1
advancement,	1
while	1
thou,	1
before	1
the	1
time,	1
and	1
contrary	1
to	1
all	1
reasonable	1
expectation,	1
seest	1
thyself	1
blessed	1
in	1
the	1
fulfillment	1
of	1
thy	1
desires.	1
Some	1
will	1
bribe,	1
beg,	1
solicit,	1
rise	1
early,	1
entreat,	1
persist,	1
without	1
attaining	1
the	1
object	1
of	1
their	1
suit;	1
while	1
another	1
comes,	1
and	1
without	1
knowing	1
why	1
or	1
wherefore,	1
finds	1
himself	1
invested	1
with	1
the	1
place	1
or	1
office	1
so	1
many	1
have	1
sued	1
for;	1
and	1
here	1
it	1
is	1
that	1
the	1
common	1
saying,	1
‘There	1
is	1
good	1
luck	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
bad	1
luck	1
in	1
suits,’	1
applies.	1
Thou,	1
who,	1
to	1
my	1
thinking,	1
art	1
beyond	1
all	1
doubt	1
a	1
dullard,	1
without	1
early	1
rising	1
or	1
night	1
watching	1
or	1
taking	1
any	1
trouble,	1
with	1
the	1
mere	1
breath	1
of	1
knight-errantry	1
that	1
has	1
breathed	1
upon	1
thee,	1
seest	1
thyself	1
without	1
more	1
ado	1
governor	1
of	1
an	1
island,	1
as	1
though	1
it	1
were	1
a	1
mere	1
matter	1
of	1
course.	1
This	1
I	1
say,	1
Sancho,	1
that	1
thou	1
attribute	1
not	1
the	1
favour	1
thou	1
hast	1
received	1
to	1
thine	1
own	1
merits,	1
but	1
give	1
thanks	1
to	1
heaven	1
that	1
disposes	1
matters	1
beneficently,	1
and	1
secondly	1
thanks	1
to	1
the	1
great	1
power	1
the	1
profession	1
of	1
knight-errantry	1
contains	1
in	1
itself.	1
With	1
a	1
heart,	1
then,	1
inclined	1
to	1
believe	1
what	1
I	1
have	1
said	1
to	1
thee,	1
attend,	1
my	1
son,	1
to	1
thy	1
Cato	1
here	1
who	1
would	1
counsel	1
thee	1
and	1
be	1
thy	1
polestar	1
and	1
guide	1
to	1
direct	1
and	1
pilot	1
thee	1
to	1
a	1
safe	1
haven	1
out	1
of	1
this	1
stormy	1
sea	1
wherein	1
thou	1
art	1
about	1
to	1
ingulf	1
thyself;	1
for	1
offices	1
and	1
great	1
trusts	1
are	1
nothing	1
else	1
but	1
a	1
mighty	1
gulf	1
of	1
troubles.	1
“First	1
of	1
all,	1
my	1
son,	1
thou	1
must	1
fear	1
God,	1
for	1
in	1
the	1
fear	1
of	1
him	1
is	1
wisdom,	1
and	1
being	1
wise	1
thou	1
canst	1
not	1
err	1
in	1
aught.	1
“Secondly,	1
thou	1
must	1
keep	1
in	1
view	1
what	1
thou	1
art,	1
striving	1
to	1
know	1
thyself,	1
the	1
most	1
difficult	1
thing	1
to	1
know	1
that	1
the	1
mind	1
can	1
imagine.	1
If	1
thou	1
knowest	1
thyself,	1
it	1
will	1
follow	1
thou	1
wilt	1
not	1
puff	1
thyself	1
up	1
like	1
the	1
frog	1
that	1
strove	1
to	1
make	1
himself	1
as	1
large	1
as	1
the	1
ox;	1
if	1
thou	1
dost,	1
the	1
recollection	1
of	1
having	1
kept	1
pigs	1
in	1
thine	1
own	1
country	1
will	1
serve	1
as	1
the	1
ugly	1
feet	1
for	1
the	1
wheel	1
of	1
thy	1
folly.”	1
“That’s	1
the	1
truth,”	1
said	1
Sancho;	1
“but	1
that	1
was	1
when	1
I	1
was	1
a	1
boy;	1
afterwards	1
when	1
I	1
was	1
something	1
more	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
it	1
was	1
geese	1
I	1
kept,	1
not	1
pigs.	1
But	1
to	1
my	1
thinking	1
that	1
has	1
nothing	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
it;	1
for	1
all	1
who	1
are	1
governors	1
don’t	1
come	1
of	1
a	1
kingly	1
stock.”	1
“True,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“and	1
for	1
that	1
reason	1
those	1
who	1
are	1
not	1
of	1
noble	1
origin	1
should	1
take	1
care	1
that	1
the	1
dignity	1
of	1
the	1
office	1
they	1
hold	1
be	1
accompanied	1
by	1
a	1
gentle	1
suavity,	1
which	1
wisely	1
managed	1
will	1
save	1
them	1
from	1
the	1
sneers	1
of	1
malice	1
that	1
no	1
station	1
escapes.	1
“Glory	1
in	1
thy	1
humble	1
birth,	1
Sancho,	1
and	1
be	1
not	1
ashamed	1
of	1
saying	1
thou	1
art	1
peasant-born;	1
for	1
when	1
it	1
is	1
seen	1
thou	1
art	1
not	1
ashamed	1
no	1
one	1
will	1
set	1
himself	1
to	1
put	1
thee	1
to	1
the	1
blush;	1
and	1
pride	1
thyself	1
rather	1
upon	1
being	1
one	1
of	1
lowly	1
virtue	1
than	1
a	1
lofty	1
sinner.	1
Countless	1
are	1
they	1
who,	1
born	1
of	1
mean	1
parentage,	1
have	1
risen	1
to	1
the	1
highest	1
dignities,	1
pontifical	1
and	1
imperial,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
truth	1
of	1
this	1
I	1
could	1
give	1
thee	1
instances	1
enough	1
to	1
weary	1
thee.	1
“Remember,	1
Sancho,	1
if	1
thou	1
make	1
virtue	1
thy	1
aim,	1
and	1
take	1
a	1
pride	1
in	1
doing	1
virtuous	1
actions,	1
thou	1
wilt	1
have	1
no	1
cause	1
to	1
envy	1
those	1
who	1
have	1
princely	1
and	1
lordly	1
ones,	1
for	1
blood	1
is	1
an	1
inheritance,	1
but	1
virtue	1
an	1
acquisition,	1
and	1
virtue	1
has	1
in	1
itself	1
alone	1
a	1
worth	1
that	1
blood	1
does	1
not	1
possess.	1
“This	1
being	1
so,	1
if	1
perchance	1
anyone	1
of	1
thy	1
kinsfolk	1
should	1
come	1
to	1
see	1
thee	1
when	1
thou	1
art	1
in	1
thine	1
island,	1
thou	1
art	1
not	1
to	1
repel	1
or	1
slight	1
him,	1
but	1
on	1
the	1
contrary	1
to	1
welcome	1
him,	1
entertain	1
him,	1
and	1
make	1
much	1
of	1
him;	1
for	1
in	1
so	1
doing	1
thou	1
wilt	1
be	1
approved	1
of	1
heaven	1
(which	1
is	1
not	1
pleased	1
that	1
any	1
should	1
despise	1
what	1
it	1
hath	1
made),	1
and	1
wilt	1
comply	1
with	1
the	1
laws	1
of	1
well-ordered	1
nature.	1
“If	1
thou	1
carriest	1
thy	1

with	1
thee	1
(and	1
it	1

not	1
well	1
for	1

repay	1
in	1

fourfold,	1
items	1
that	1

“Let	1

“If	1

at	1
the	1

thy	1

“If	1

thy	1

“Abuse	1

whom	1
thou	1
hast	1
to	1
punish	1
in	1
deed,	1
for	1
the	1
pain	1
of	1
punishment	1
is	1
enough	1
for	1
the	1
unfortunate	1
without	1
the	1
addition	1
of	1
thine	1

“Bear	1
in	1
mind	1
that	1
the	1
culprit	1
who	1
comes	1
under	1
thy	1
jurisdiction	1
is	1
but	1
a	1
miserable	1

to	1
all	1

our	1
depraved	1
nature,	1

so	1

as	1
may	1
be	1
in	1
thy	1
power	1

thyself	1
lenient	1

forbearing;	1
for	1
though	1
the	1

God	1

“If	1
thou	1

these	1
precepts	1

rules,	1
Sancho,	1
thy	1
days	1
will	1
be	1
long,	1
thy	1
fame	1
eternal,	1
thy	1
reward	1
abundant,	1
thy	1
felicity	1
unutterable;	1
thou	1

thy	1
children	1
as	1
thou	1

thy	1
grandchildren	1

bear	1

thou	1
wilt	1
live	1
in	1
peace	1

concord	1
with	1
all	1
men;	1
and,	1
when	1
life	1
draws	1
to	1
a	1
close,	1
death	1
will	1
come	1
to	1
thee	1
in	1
calm	1

ripe	1
old	1
age,	1
and	1
the	1
light	1
and	1
loving	1
hands	1
of	1
thy	1
great-grandchildren	1
will	1
close	1
thine	1
eyes.	1
“What	1
I	1
have	1
thus	1
far	1
addressed	1
to	1
thee	1

thy	1

Who,	1
hearing	1
the	1
foregoing	1
discourse	1
of	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
set	1
him	1
down	1
for	1
a	1
person	1
of	1
great	1
good	1
sense	1
and	1
greater	1
rectitude	1
of	1
purpose?	1
But,	1
as	1
has	1
been	1
frequently	1
observed	1
in	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
this	1
great	1
history,	1
he	1
only	1
talked	1
nonsense	1
when	1
he	1
touched	1
on	1
chivalry,	1
and	1
in	1
discussing	1
all	1
other	1
subjects	1
showed	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
a	1
clear	1
and	1
unbiassed	1
understanding;	1
so	1
that	1
at	1
every	1
turn	1
his	1
acts	1
gave	1
the	1
lie	1
to	1
his	1
intellect,	1
and	1
his	1
intellect	1
to	1
his	1
acts;	1
but	1
in	1
the	1
case	1
of	1
these	1
second	1
counsels	1
that	1
he	1
gave	1
Sancho,	1
he	1
showed	1
himself	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
lively	1
turn	1
of	1
humour,	1
and	1
displayed	1
conspicuously	1
his	1
wisdom,	1
and	1
also	1
his	1
folly.	1
Sancho	1
listened	1
to	1
him	1
with	1
the	1
deepest	1
attention,	1
and	1
endeavoured	1
to	1
fix	1
his	1
counsels	1
in	1
his	1
memory,	1
like	1
one	1
who	1
meant	1
to	1
follow	1
them	1
and	1
by	1
their	1
means	1
bring	1
the	1
full	1
promise	1
of	1
his	1
government	1
to	1
a	1
happy	1
issue.	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
then,	1
went	1
on	1
to	1
say:	1
“With	1
regard	1
to	1
the	1
mode	1
in	1
which	1
thou	1
shouldst	1
govern	1
thy	1
person	1
and	1
thy	1
house,	1
Sancho,	1
the	1
first	1
charge	1
I	1
have	1
to	1
give	1
thee	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
clean,	1
and	1
to	1
cut	1
thy	1
nails,	1
not	1
letting	1
them	1
grow	1
as	1
some	1
do,	1
whose	1
ignorance	1
makes	1
them	1
fancy	1
that	1
long	1
nails	1
are	1
an	1
ornament	1
to	1
their	1
hands,	1
as	1
if	1
those	1
excrescences	1
they	1
neglect	1
to	1
cut	1
were	1
nails,	1
and	1
not	1
the	1
talons	1
of	1
a	1
lizard-catching	1
kestrel—a	1
filthy	1
and	1
unnatural	1
abuse.	1
“Go	1
not	1
ungirt	1
and	1
loose,	1
Sancho;	1
for	1
disordered	1
attire	1
is	1
a	1
sign	1
of	1
an	1
unstable	1
mind,	1
unless	1
indeed	1
the	1
slovenliness	1
and	1
slackness	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
set	1
down	1
to	1
craft,	1
as	1
was	1
the	1
common	1
opinion	1
in	1
the	1
case	1
of	1
Julius	1
Cæsar.	1
“Ascertain	1
cautiously	1
what	1
thy	1
office	1
may	1
be	1
worth;	1
and	1
if	1
it	1
will	1
allow	1
thee	1
to	1
give	1
liveries	1
to	1
thy	1
servants,	1
give	1
them	1
respectable	1
and	1
serviceable,	1
rather	1
than	1
showy	1
and	1
gay	1
ones,	1
and	1
divide	1
them	1
between	1
thy	1
servants	1
and	1
the	1
poor;	1
that	1
is	1
to	1
say,	1
if	1
thou	1
canst	1
clothe	1
six	1
pages,	1
clothe	1
three	1
and	1
three	1
poor	1
men,	1
and	1
thus	1
thou	1
wilt	1
have	1
pages	1
for	1
heaven	1
and	1
pages	1
for	1
earth;	1
the	1
vainglorious	1
never	1
think	1
of	1
this	1
new	1
mode	1
of	1
giving	1
liveries.	1
“Eat	1
not	1
garlic	1
nor	1
onions,	1
lest	1
they	1
find	1
out	1
thy	1
boorish	1
origin	1
by	1
the	1
smell;	1
walk	1
slowly	1
and	1
speak	1
deliberately,	1
but	1
not	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
way	1
as	1
to	1
make	1
it	1
seem	1
thou	1
art	1
listening	1
to	1
thyself,	1
for	1
all	1
affectation	1
is	1
bad.	1
“Dine	1
sparingly	1
and	1
sup	1
more	1
sparingly	1
still;	1
for	1
the	1
health	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
body	1
is	1
forged	1
in	1
the	1
workshop	1
of	1
the	1
stomach.	1
“Be	1
temperate	1
in	1
drinking,	1
bearing	1
in	1
mind	1
that	1
wine	1
in	1
excess	1
keeps	1
neither	1
secrets	1
nor	1
promises.	1
“Take	1
care,	1
Sancho,	1
not	1
to	1
chew	1
on	1
both	1
sides,	1
and	1
not	1
to	1
eruct	1
in	1
anybody’s	1
presence.”	1
“Eruct!”	1
said	1
Sancho;	1
“I	1
don’t	1
know	1
what	1
that	1
means.”	1
“To	1
eruct,	1
Sancho,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“means	1
to	1
belch,	1
and	1
that	1
is	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
filthiest	1
words	1
in	1
the	1
Spanish	1
language,	1
though	1
a	1
very	1
expressive	1
one;	1
and	1
therefore	1
nice	1
folk	1
have	1
had	1
recourse	1
to	1
the	1
Latin,	1
and	1
instead	1
of	1
belch	1
say	1
eruct,	1
and	1
instead	1
of	1
belches	1
say	1
eructations;	1
and	1
if	1
some	1
do	1
not	1
understand	1
these	1
terms	1
it	1
matters	1
little,	1
for	1
custom	1
will	1
bring	1
them	1
into	1
use	1
in	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
time,	1
so	1
that	1
they	1
will	1
be	1
readily	1
understood;	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
way	1
a	1
language	1
is	1
enriched;	1
custom	1
and	1
the	1
public	1
are	1
all-powerful	1
there.”	1
“In	1
truth,	1
señor,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“one	1
of	1
the	1
counsels	1
and	1
cautions	1
I	1
mean	1
to	1
bear	1
in	1
mind	1
shall	1
be	1
this,	1
not	1
to	1
belch,	1
for	1
I’m	1
constantly	1
doing	1
it.”	1
“Eruct,	1
Sancho,	1
not	1
belch,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote.	1
“Eruct,	1
I	1
shall	1
say	1
henceforth,	1
and	1
I	1
swear	1
not	1
to	1
forget	1
it,”	1
said	1
Sancho.	1
“Likewise,	1
Sancho,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“thou	1
must	1
not	1
mingle	1
such	1
a	1
quantity	1
of	1
proverbs	1
in	1
thy	1
discourse	1
as	1
thou	1
dost;	1
for	1
though	1
proverbs	1
are	1
short	1
maxims,	1
thou	1
dost	1
drag	1
them	1
in	1
so	1
often	1
by	1
the	1
head	1
and	1
shoulders	1
that	1
they	1
savour	1
more	1
of	1
nonsense	1
than	1
of	1
maxims.”	1
“God	1
alone	1
can	1
cure	1
that,”	1
said	1
Sancho;	1
“for	1
I	1
have	1
more	1
proverbs	1
in	1
me	1
than	1
a	1
book,	1
and	1
when	1
I	1
speak	1
they	1
come	1
so	1
thick	1
together	1
into	1
my	1
mouth	1
that	1
they	1
fall	1
to	1
fighting	1
among	1
themselves	1
to	1
get	1
out;	1
that’s	1
why	1
my	1
tongue	1
lets	1
fly	1
the	1
first	1
that	1
come,	1
though	1
they	1
may	1
not	1
be	1
pat	1
to	1
the	1
purpose.	1
But	1
I’ll	1
take	1
care	1
henceforward	1
to	1
use	1
such	1
as	1
befit	1
the	1
dignity	1
of	1
my	1
office;	1
for	1
‘in	1
a	1
house	1
where	1
there’s	1
plenty,	1
supper	1
is	1
soon	1
cooked,’	1
and	1
‘he	1
who	1
binds	1
does	1
not	1
wrangle,’	1
and	1
‘the	1
bell-ringer’s	1
in	1
a	1
safe	1
berth,’	1
and	1
‘giving	1
and	1
keeping	1
require	1
brains.’”	1
“That’s	1
it,	1
Sancho!”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
“pack,	1
tack,	1
string	1
proverbs	1
together;	1
nobody	1
is	1
hindering	1
thee!	1
‘My	1
mother	1
beats	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
go	1
on	1
with	1
my	1
tricks.’	1
I	1
am	1
bidding	1
thee	1
avoid	1
proverbs,	1
and	1
here	1
in	1
a	1
second	1
thou	1
hast	1
shot	1
out	1
a	1
whole	1
litany	1
of	1
them,	1
which	1
have	1
as	1
much	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
what	1
we	1
are	1
talking	1
about	1
as	1
‘over	1
the	1
hills	1
of	1
Úbeda.’	1
Mind,	1
Sancho,	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
say	1
that	1
a	1
proverb	1
aptly	1
brought	1
in	1
is	1
objectionable;	1
but	1
to	1
pile	1
up	1
and	1
string	1
together	1
proverbs	1
at	1
random	1
makes	1
conversation	1
dull	1
and	1
vulgar.	1
“When	1
thou	1
ridest	1
on	1
horseback,	1
do	1
not	1
go	1
lolling	1
with	1
thy	1
body	1
on	1
the	1
back	1
of	1
the	1
saddle,	1
nor	1
carry	1
thy	1
legs	1
stiff	1
or	1
sticking	1
out	1
from	1
the	1
horse’s	1
belly,	1
nor	1
yet	1
sit	1
so	1
loosely	1
that	1
one	1
would	1
suppose	1
thou	1
wert	1
on	1
Dapple;	1
for	1
the	1
seat	1
on	1
a	1
horse	1
makes	1
gentlemen	1
of	1
some	1
and	1
grooms	1
of	1
others.	1
“Be	1
moderate	1
in	1
thy	1
sleep;	1
for	1
he	1
who	1
does	1
not	1
rise	1
early	1
does	1
not	1
get	1
the	1
benefit	1
of	1
the	1
day;	1
and	1
remember,	1
Sancho,	1
diligence	1
is	1
the	1
mother	1
of	1
good	1
fortune,	1
and	1
indolence,	1
its	1
opposite,	1
never	1
yet	1
attained	1
the	1
object	1
of	1
an	1
honest	1
ambition.	1
“The	1
last	1
counsel	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
thee	1
now,	1
though	1
it	1
does	1
not	1
tend	1
to	1
bodily	1
improvement,	1
I	1
would	1
have	1
thee	1
carry	1
carefully	1
in	1
thy	1
memory,	1
for	1
I	1
believe	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
no	1
less	1
useful	1
to	1
thee	1
than	1
those	1
I	1
have	1
given	1
thee	1
already,	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
this—never	1
engage	1
in	1
a	1
dispute	1
about	1
families,	1
at	1
least	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
comparing	1
them	1
one	1
with	1
another;	1
for	1
necessarily	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
compared	1
will	1
be	1
better	1
than	1
the	1
other,	1
and	1
thou	1
wilt	1
be	1
hated	1
by	1
the	1
one	1
thou	1
hast	1
disparaged,	1
and	1
get	1
nothing	1
in	1
any	1
shape	1
from	1
the	1
one	1
thou	1
hast	1
exalted.	1
“Thy	1
attire	1
shall	1
be	1
hose	1
of	1
full	1
length,	1
a	1
long	1
jerkin,	1
and	1
a	1
cloak	1
a	1
trifle	1
longer;	1
loose	1
breeches	1
by	1
no	1
means,	1
for	1
they	1
are	1
becoming	1
neither	1
for	1
gentlemen	1
nor	1
for	1
governors.	1
“For	1
the	1
present,	1
Sancho,	1
this	1
is	1
all	1
that	1
has	1
occurred	1
to	1
me	1
to	1
advise	1
thee;	1
as	1
time	1
goes	1
by	1
and	1
occasions	1
arise	1
my	1
instructions	1
shall	1
follow,	1
if	1
thou	1
take	1
care	1
to	1
let	1
me	1
know	1
how	1
thou	1
art	1
circumstanced.”	1
“Señor,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“I	1
see	1
well	1
enough	1
that	1
all	1
these	1
things	1
your	1
worship	1
has	1
said	1
to	1
me	1
are	1
good,	1
holy,	1
and	1
profitable;	1
but	1
what	1
use	1
will	1
they	1
be	1
to	1
me	1
if	1
I	1
don’t	1
remember	1
one	1
of	1
them?	1
To	1
be	1
sure	1
that	1
about	1
not	1
letting	1
my	1
nails	1
grow,	1
and	1
marrying	1
again	1
if	1
I	1
have	1
the	1
chance,	1
will	1
not	1
slip	1
out	1
of	1
my	1
head;	1
but	1
all	1
that	1
other	1
hash,	1
muddle,	1
and	1
jumble—I	1
don’t	1
and	1
can’t	1
recollect	1
any	1
more	1
of	1
it	1
than	1
of	1
last	1
year’s	1
clouds;	1
so	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
given	1
me	1
in	1
writing;	1
for	1
though	1
I	1
can’t	1
either	1
read	1
or	1
write,	1
I’ll	1
give	1
it	1
to	1
my	1
confessor,	1
to	1
drive	1
it	1
into	1
me	1
and	1
remind	1
me	1
of	1
it	1
whenever	1
it	1
is	1
necessary.”	1
“Ah,	1
sinner	1
that	1
I	1
am!”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“how	1
bad	1
it	1
looks	1
in	1
governors	1
not	1
to	1
know	1
how	1
to	1
read	1
or	1
write;	1
for	1
let	1
me	1
tell	1
thee,	1
Sancho,	1
when	1
a	1
man	1
knows	1
not	1
how	1
to	1
read,	1
or	1
is	1
left-handed,	1
it	1
argues	1
one	1
of	1
two	1
things;	1
either	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
exceedingly	1
mean	1
and	1
lowly	1
parents,	1
or	1
that	1
he	1
himself	1
was	1
so	1
incorrigible	1
and	1
ill-conditioned	1
that	1
neither	1
good	1
company	1
nor	1
good	1
teaching	1
could	1
make	1
any	1
impression	1
on	1
him.	1
It	1
is	1
a	1
great	1
defect	1
that	1
thou	1
labourest	1
under,	1
and	1
therefore	1
I	1
would	1
have	1
thee	1
learn	1
at	1
any	1
rate	1
to	1
sign	1
thy	1
name.”	1
“I	1
can	1
sign	1
my	1
name	1
well	1
enough,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“for	1
when	1
I	1
was	1
steward	1
of	1
the	1
brotherhood	1
in	1
my	1
village	1
I	1
learned	1
to	1
make	1
certain	1
letters,	1
like	1
the	1
marks	1
on	1
bales	1
of	1
goods,	1
which	1
they	1
told	1
me	1
made	1
out	1
my	1
name.	1
Besides	1
I	1
can	1
pretend	1
my	1
right	1
hand	1
is	1
disabled	1
and	1
make	1
someone	1
else	1
sign	1
for	1
me,	1
for	1
‘there’s	1
a	1
remedy	1
for	1
everything	1
except	1
death;’	1
and	1
as	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
in	1
command	1
and	1
hold	1
the	1
staff,	1
I	1
can	1
do	1
as	1
I	1
like;	1
moreover,	1
‘he	1
who	1
has	1
the	1
alcalde	1
for	1
his	1
father-,’	1
and	1
I’ll	1
be	1
governor,	1
and	1
that’s	1
higher	1
than	1
alcalde.	1
Only	1
come	1
and	1
see!	1
Let	1
them	1
make	1
light	1
of	1
me	1
and	1
abuse	1
me;	1
‘they’ll	1
come	1
for	1
wool	1
and	1
go	1
back	1
shorn;’	1
‘whom	1
God	1
loves,	1
his	1
house	1
is	1
known	1
to	1
Him;’	1
‘the	1
silly	1
sayings	1
of	1
the	1
rich	1
pass	1
for	1
saws	1
in	1
the	1
world;’	1
and	1
as	1
I’ll	1
be	1
rich,	1
being	1
a	1
governor,	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
generous,	1
as	1
I	1
mean	1
to	1
be,	1
no	1
fault	1
will	1
be	1
seen	1
in	1
me.	1
‘Only	1
make	1
yourself	1
honey	1
and	1
the	1
flies	1
will	1
suck	1
you;’	1
‘as	1
much	1
as	1
thou	1
hast	1
so	1
much	1
art	1
thou	1
worth,’	1
as	1
my	1
grandmother	1
used	1
to	1
say;	1
and	1
‘thou	1
canst	1
have	1
no	1
revenge	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
substance.’”	1
“Oh,	1
God’s	1
curse	1
upon	1
thee,	1
Sancho!”	1
here	1
exclaimed	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
“sixty	1
thousand	1
devils	1
fly	1
away	1
with	1
thee	1
and	1
thy	1
proverbs!	1
For	1
the	1
last	1
hour	1
thou	1
hast	1
been	1
stringing	1
them	1
together	1
and	1
inflicting	1
the	1
pangs	1
of	1
torture	1
on	1
me	1
with	1
every	1
one	1
of	1
them.	1
Those	1
proverbs	1
will	1
bring	1
thee	1
to	1
the	1
gallows	1
one	1
day,	1
I	1
promise	1
thee;	1
thy	1
subjects	1
will	1
take	1
the	1
government	1
from	1
thee,	1
or	1
there	1
will	1
be	1
revolts	1
among	1
them.	1
Tell	1
me,	1
where	1
dost	1
thou	1
pick	1
them	1
up,	1
thou	1
booby?	1
How	1
dost	1
thou	1
apply	1
them,	1
thou	1
blockhead?	1
For	1
with	1
me,	1
to	1
utter	1
one	1
and	1
make	1
it	1
apply	1
properly,	1
I	1
have	1
to	1
sweat	1
and	1
labour	1
as	1
if	1
I	1
were	1
digging.”	1
“By	1
God,	1
master	1
mine,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“your	1
worship	1
is	1
making	1
a	1
fuss	1
about	1
very	1
little.	1
Why	1
the	1
devil	1
should	1
you	1
be	1
vexed	1
if	1
I	1
make	1
use	1
of	1
what	1
is	1
my	1
own?	1
And	1
I	1
have	1
got	1
nothing	1
else,	1
nor	1
any	1
other	1
stock	1
in	1
trade	1
except	1
proverbs	1
and	1
more	1
proverbs;	1
and	1
here	1
are	1
three	1
just	1
this	1
instant	1
come	1
into	1
my	1
head,	1
pat	1
to	1
the	1
purpose	1
and	1
like	1
pears	1
in	1
a	1
basket;	1
but	1
I	1
won’t	1
repeat	1
them,	1
for	1
‘sage	1
silence	1
is	1
called	1
Sancho.’”	1
“That,	1
Sancho,	1
thou	1
art	1
not,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
“for	1
not	1
only	1
art	1
thou	1
not	1
sage	1
silence,	1
but	1
thou	1
art	1
pestilent	1
prate	1
and	1
perversity;	1
still	1
I	1
would	1
like	1
to	1
know	1
what	1
three	1
proverbs	1
have	1
just	1
now	1
come	1
into	1
thy	1
memory,	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
turning	1
over	1
mine	1
own—and	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
good	1
one—and	1
none	1
occurs	1
to	1
me.”	1
“What	1
can	1
be	1
better,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“than	1
‘never	1
put	1
thy	1
thumbs	1
between	1
two	1
back	1
teeth;’	1
and	1
‘to	1
“_get	1
out	1
of	1
my	1
house_”	1
and	1
“_what	1
do	1
you	1
want	1
with	1
my	1
wife?_”	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
answer;’	1
and	1
‘whether	1
the	1
pitcher	1
hits	1
the	1
stove,	1
or	1
the	1
stove	1
the	1
pitcher,	1
it’s	1
a	1
bad	1
business	1
for	1
the	1
pitcher;’	1
all	1
which	1
fit	1
to	1
a	1
hair?	1
For	1
no	1
one	1
should	1
quarrel	1
with	1
his	1
governor,	1
or	1
him	1
in	1
authority	1
over	1
him,	1
because	1
he	1
will	1
come	1
off	1
the	1
worst,	1
as	1
he	1
does	1
who	1
puts	1
his	1
finger	1
between	1
two	1
back	1
and	1
if	1
they	1
are	1
not	1
back	1
teeth	1
it	1
makes	1
no	1
difference,	1
so	1
long	1
as	1
they	1
are	1
teeth;	1
and	1
to	1
whatever	1
the	1
governor	1
may	1
say	1
there’s	1
no	1
answer,	1
any	1
more	1
than	1
to	1
‘get	1
out	1
of	1
my	1
house’	1
and	1
‘what	1
do	1
you	1
want	1
with	1
my	1
wife?’	1
and	1
then,	1
as	1
for	1
that	1
about	1
the	1
stone	1
and	1
the	1
pitcher,	1
a	1
blind	1
man	1
could	1
see	1
that.	1
So	1
that	1
he	1
‘who	1
sees	1
the	1
mote	1
in	1
another’s	1
eye	1
had	1
need	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
beam	1
in	1
his	1
own,’	1
that	1
it	1
be	1
not	1
said	1
of	1
himself,	1
‘the	1
dead	1
woman	1
was	1
frightened	1
at	1
the	1
one	1
with	1
her	1
throat	1
cut;’	1
and	1
your	1
worship	1
knows	1
well	1
that	1
‘the	1
fool	1
knows	1
more	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
house	1
than	1
the	1
wise	1
man	1
in	1
another’s.’”	1
“Nay,	1
Sancho,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“the	1
fool	1
knows	1
nothing,	1
either	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
house	1
or	1
in	1
anybody	1
else’s,	1
for	1
no	1
wise	1
structure	1
of	1
any	1
sort	1
can	1
stand	1
on	1
a	1
foundation	1
of	1
folly;	1
but	1
let	1
us	1
say	1
no	1
more	1
about	1
it,	1
Sancho,	1
for	1
if	1
thou	1
governest	1
badly,	1
thine	1
will	1
be	1
the	1
fault	1
and	1
mine	1
the	1
shame;	1
but	1
I	1
comfort	1
myself	1
with	1
having	1
done	1
my	1
duty	1
in	1
advising	1
thee	1
as	1
earnestly	1
and	1
as	1
wisely	1
as	1
I	1
could;	1
and	1
thus	1
I	1
am	1
released	1
from	1
my	1
obligations	1
and	1
my	1
promise.	1
God	1
guide	1
thee,	1
Sancho,	1
and	1
govern	1
thee	1
in	1
thy	1
government,	1
and	1
deliver	1
me	1
from	1
the	1
misgiving	1
I	1
have	1
that	1
thou	1
wilt	1
turn	1
the	1
whole	1
island	1
upside	1
down,	1
a	1
thing	1
I	1
might	1
easily	1
prevent	1
by	1
explaining	1
to	1
the	1
duke	1
what	1
thou	1
art	1
and	1
telling	1
him	1
that	1
all	1
that	1
fat	1
little	1
person	1
of	1
thine	1
is	1
nothing	1
else	1
but	1
a	1
sack	1
full	1
of	1
proverbs	1
and	1
sauciness.”	1
“Señor,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“if	1
your	1
worship	1
thinks	1
I’m	1
not	1
fit	1
for	1
this	1
government,	1
I	1
give	1
it	1
up	1
on	1
the	1
spot;	1
for	1
the	1
mere	1
black	1
of	1
the	1
nail	1
of	1
my	1
soul	1
is	1
dearer	1
to	1
me	1
than	1
my	1
whole	1
body;	1
and	1
I	1
can	1
live	1
just	1
as	1
well,	1
simple	1
Sancho,	1
on	1
bread	1
and	1
onions,	1
as	1
governor,	1
on	1
partridges	1
and	1
capons;	1
and	1
what’s	1
more,	1
while	1
we’re	1
asleep	1
we’re	1
all	1
equal,	1
great	1
and	1
small,	1
rich	1
and	1
poor.	1
But	1
if	1
your	1
worship	1
looks	1
into	1
it,	1
you	1
will	1
see	1
it	1
was	1
your	1
worship	1
alone	1
that	1
put	1
me	1
on	1
to	1
this	1
business	1
of	1
governing;	1
for	1
I	1
know	1
no	1
more	1
about	1
the	1
government	1
of	1
islands	1
than	1
a	1
buzzard;	1
and	1
if	1
there’s	1
any	1
reason	1
to	1
think	1
that	1
because	1
of	1
my	1
being	1
a	1
governor	1
the	1
devil	1
will	1
get	1
hold	1
of	1
me,	1
I’d	1
rather	1
go	1
Sancho	1
to	1
heaven	1
than	1
governor	1
to	1
hell.”	1
“By	1
God,	1
Sancho,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“for	1
those	1
last	1
words	1
thou	1
hast	1
uttered	1
alone,	1
I	1
consider	1
thou	1
deservest	1
to	1
be	1
governor	1
of	1
a	1
thousand	1
islands.	1
Thou	1
hast	1
good	1
natural	1
instincts,	1
without	1
which	1
no	1
knowledge	1
is	1
worth	1
anything;	1
commend	1
thyself	1
to	1
God,	1
and	1
try	1
not	1
to	1
swerve	1
in	1
the	1
pursuit	1
of	1
thy	1
main	1
object;	1
I	1
mean,	1
always	1
make	1
it	1
thy	1
aim	1
and	1
fixed	1
purpose	1
to	1
do	1
right	1
in	1
all	1
matters	1
that	1
come	1
before	1
thee,	1
for	1
heaven	1
always	1
helps	1
good	1
intentions;	1
and	1
now	1
let	1
us	1
go	1
to	1
dinner,	1
for	1
I	1
think	1
my	1
lord	1
and	1
lady	1
are	1
waiting	1
for	1
us.”	1

It	1
is	1
stated,	1
they	1
say,	1
in	1
the	1
true	1
original	1
of	1
this	1
history,	1
that	1
when	1
Cide	1
Hamete	1
came	1
to	1
write	1
this	1
chapter,	1
his	1
interpreter	1
did	1
not	1
translate	1
it	1
as	1
he	1
wrote	1
it—that	1
is,	1
as	1
a	1
kind	1
of	1
complaint	1
the	1
Moor	1
made	1
against	1
himself	1
for	1
having	1
taken	1
in	1
hand	1
a	1
story	1
so	1
dry	1
and	1
of	1
so	1
little	1
variety	1
as	1
this	1
of	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
for	1
he	1
found	1
himself	1
forced	1
to	1
speak	1
perpetually	1
of	1
him	1
and	1
Sancho,	1
without	1
venturing	1
to	1
indulge	1
in	1
digressions	1
and	1
episodes	1
more	1
serious	1
and	1
more	1
interesting.	1
He	1
said,	1
too,	1
that	1
to	1
go	1
on,	1
mind,	1
hand,	1
pen	1
always	1
restricted	1
to	1
writing	1
upon	1
one	1
single	1
subject,	1
and	1
speaking	1
through	1
the	1
mouths	1
of	1
a	1
few	1
characters,	1
was	1
intolerable	1
drudgery,	1
the	1
result	1
of	1
which	1
was	1
never	1
equal	1
to	1
the	1
author’s	1
labour,	1
and	1
that	1
to	1
avoid	1
this	1
he	1
had	1
in	1
the	1
First	1
Part	1
availed	1
himself	1
of	1
the	1
device	1
of	1
novels,	1
like	1
“The	1
Ill-advised	1
Curiosity,”	1
and	1
“The	1
Captive	1
Captain,”	1
which	1
stand,	1
as	1
it	1
were,	1
apart	1
from	1
the	1
story;	1
the	1
others	1
are	1
given	1
there	1
being	1
incidents	1
which	1
occurred	1
to	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
himself	1
and	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
omitted.	1
He	1
also	1
thought,	1
he	1
says,	1
that	1
many,	1
engrossed	1
by	1
the	1
interest	1
attaching	1
to	1
the	1
exploits	1
of	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
would	1
take	1
none	1
in	1
the	1
novels,	1
and	1
pass	1
them	1
over	1
hastily	1
or	1
impatiently	1
without	1
noticing	1
the	1
elegance	1
and	1
art	1
of	1
their	1
composition,	1
which	1
would	1
be	1
very	1
manifest	1
were	1
they	1
published	1
by	1
themselves	1
and	1
not	1
as	1
mere	1
adjuncts	1
to	1
the	1
crazes	1
of	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
or	1
the	1
simplicities	1
of	1
Sancho.	1
Therefore	1
in	1
this	1
Second	1
Part	1
he	1
thought	1
it	1
best	1
not	1
to	1
insert	1
novels,	1
either	1
separate	1
or	1
interwoven,	1
but	1
only	1
episodes,	1
something	1
like	1
them,	1
arising	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
circumstances	1
the	1
facts	1
present;	1
and	1
even	1
these	1
sparingly,	1
and	1
with	1
no	1
more	1
words	1
than	1
suffice	1
to	1
make	1
them	1
plain;	1
and	1
as	1
he	1
confines	1
and	1
restricts	1
himself	1
to	1
the	1
narrow	1
limits	1
of	1
the	1
narrative,	1
though	1
he	1
has	1
ability;	1
capacity,	1
and	1
brains	1
enough	1
to	1
deal	1
with	1
the	1
whole	1
universe,	1
he	1
requests	1
that	1
his	1
labours	1
may	1
not	1
be	1
despised,	1
and	1
that	1
credit	1
be	1
given	1
him,	1
not	1
alone	1
for	1
what	1
he	1
writes,	1
but	1
for	1
what	1
he	1
has	1
refrained	1
from	1
writing.	1
And	1
so	1
he	1
goes	1
on	1
with	1
his	1
story,	1
saying	1
that	1
the	1
day	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
gave	1
the	1
counsels	1
to	1
Sancho,	1
the	1
same	1
afternoon	1
after	1
dinner	1
he	1
handed	1
them	1
to	1
him	1
in	1
writing	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
get	1
someone	1
to	1
read	1
them	1
to	1
him.	1
They	1
had	1
scarcely,	1
however,	1
been	1
given	1
to	1
him	1
when	1
he	1
let	1
them	1
drop,	1
and	1
they	1
fell	1
into	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
the	1
duke,	1
who	1
showed	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
duchess	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
both	1
amazed	1
afresh	1
at	1
the	1
madness	1
and	1
wit	1
of	1
Don	1
Quixote.	1
To	1
carry	1
on	1
the	1
joke,	1
then,	1
the	1
same	1
evening	1
they	1
despatched	1
Sancho	1
with	1
a	1
large	1
following	1
to	1
the	1
village	1
that	1
was	1
to	1
serve	1
him	1
for	1
an	1
island.	1
It	1
happened	1
that	1
the	1
person	1
who	1
had	1
him	1
in	1
charge	1
was	1
a	1
majordomo	1
of	1
the	1
duke’s,	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
great	1
discretion	1
and	1
humour—and	1
there	1
can	1
be	1
no	1
humour	1
without	1
discretion—and	1
the	1
same	1
who	1
played	1
the	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
Countess	1
Trifaldi	1
in	1
the	1
comical	1
way	1
that	1
has	1
been	1
already	1
described;	1
and	1
thus	1
qualified,	1
and	1
instructed	1
by	1
his	1
master	1
and	1
mistress	1
as	1
to	1
how	1
to	1
deal	1
with	1
Sancho,	1
he	1
carried	1
out	1
their	1
scheme	1
admirably.	1
Now	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
Sancho	1
saw	1
this	1
majordomo	1
he	1
seemed	1
in	1
his	1
features	1
to	1
recognise	1
those	1
of	1
the	1
Trifaldi,	1
and	1
turning	1
to	1
his	1
master,	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
him,	1
“Señor,	1
either	1
the	1
devil	1
will	1
carry	1
me	1
off,	1
here	1
on	1
this	1
spot,	1
righteous	1
and	1
believing,	1
or	1
your	1
worship	1
will	1
own	1
to	1
me	1
that	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
this	1
majordomo	1
of	1
the	1
duke’s	1
here	1
is	1
the	1
very	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
Distressed	1
One.”	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
regarded	1
the	1
majordomo	1
attentively,	1
and	1
having	1
done	1
so,	1
said	1
to	1
Sancho,	1
“There	1
is	1
no	1
reason	1
why	1
the	1
devil	1
should	1
carry	1
thee	1
off,	1
Sancho,	1
either	1
righteous	1
or	1
believing—and	1
what	1
thou	1
meanest	1
by	1
that	1
I	1
know	1
not;	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
Distressed	1
One	1
is	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
majordomo,	1
but	1
for	1
all	1
that	1
the	1
majordomo	1
is	1
not	1
the	1
Distressed	1
One;	1
for	1
his	1
being	1
so	1
would	1
involve	1
a	1
mighty	1
contradiction;	1
but	1
this	1
is	1
not	1
the	1
time	1
for	1
going	1
into	1
questions	1
of	1
the	1
sort,	1
which	1
would	1
be	1
involving	1
ourselves	1
in	1
an	1
inextricable	1
labyrinth.	1
Believe	1
me,	1
my	1
friend,	1
we	1
must	1
pray	1
earnestly	1
to	1
our	1
Lord	1
that	1
he	1
deliver	1
us	1
both	1
from	1
wicked	1
wizards	1
and	1
enchanters.”	1
“It	1
is	1
no	1
joke,	1
señor,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“for	1
before	1
this	1
I	1
heard	1
him	1
speak,	1
and	1
it	1
seemed	1
exactly	1
as	1
if	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
the	1
Trifaldi	1
was	1
sounding	1
in	1
my	1
ears.	1
Well,	1
I’ll	1
hold	1
my	1
peace;	1
but	1
I’ll	1
take	1
care	1
to	1
be	1
on	1
the	1
look-out	1
henceforth	1
for	1
any	1
sign	1
that	1
may	1
be	1
seen	1
to	1
confirm	1
or	1
do	1
away	1
with	1
this	1
suspicion.”	1
“Thou	1
wilt	1
do	1
well,	1
Sancho,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“and	1
thou	1
wilt	1
let	1
me	1
know	1
all	1
thou	1
discoverest,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
befalls	1
thee	1
in	1
thy	1
government.”	1
Sancho	1
at	1
last	1
set	1
out	1
attended	1
by	1
a	1
great	1
number	1
of	1
people.	1
He	1
was	1
dressed	1
in	1
the	1
garb	1
of	1
a	1
lawyer,	1
with	1
a	1
gaban	1
of	1
tawny	1
watered	1
camlet	1
over	1
all	1
and	1
a	1
montera	1
cap	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
material,	1
and	1
mounted	1
a	1
la	1
gineta	1
upon	1
a	1
mule.	1
Behind	1
him,	1
in	1
accordance	1
with	1
the	1
duke’s	1
orders,	1
followed	1
Dapple	1
with	1
brand	1
new	1
ass-trappings	1
and	1
ornaments	1
of	1
silk,	1
and	1
from	1
time	1
to	1
time	1
Sancho	1
turned	1
round	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
his	1
ass,	1
so	1
well	1
pleased	1
to	1
have	1
him	1
with	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
changed	1
places	1
with	1
the	1
emperor	1
of	1
Germany.	1
On	1
taking	1
leave	1
he	1
kissed	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
the	1
duke	1
and	1
duchess	1
and	1
got	1
his	1
master’s	1
blessing,	1
which	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
gave	1
him	1
with	1
tears,	1
and	1
he	1
received	1
blubbering.	1

Let	1
worthy	1
Sancho	1
go	1
in	1
peace,	1
and	1
good	1
luck	1
to	1
him,	1
Gentle	1
Reader;	1
and	1
look	1
out	1
for	1
two	1
bushels	1
of	1
laughter,	1
which	1
the	1
account	1
of	1
how	1
he	1
behaved	1
himself	1
in	1

thee.	1
In	1
the	1
meantime	1
turn	1
thy	1
attention	1
to	1
what	1
happened	1
his	1
master	1
the	1
same	1
night,	1
and	1
if	1
thou	1
dost	1
not	1
laugh	1
thereat,	1
at	1
any	1
rate	1
thou	1
wilt	1
stretch	1
thy	1
mouth	1
with	1
a	1
grin;	1
for	1
Don	1
Quixote’s	1
adventures	1
must	1
be	1
honoured	1
either	1
with	1
wonder	1
or	1
with	1
laughter.	1
It	1
is	1
recorded,	1
then,	1
that	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
Sancho	1
had	1
gone,	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
felt	1
his	1
loneliness,	1
and	1
had	1
it	1
been	1
possible	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
revoke	1
the	1
mandate	1
and	1
take	1
away	1
the	1
government	1
from	1
him	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
done	1
so.	1
The	1
duchess	1
observed	1
his	1
dejection	1
and	1
asked	1
him	1
why	1
he	1
was	1
melancholy;	1
because,	1
she	1
said,	1
if	1
it	1
was	1
for	1
the	1
loss	1
of	1
Sancho,	1
there	1
were	1
squires,	1
duennas,	1
and	1
damsels	1
in	1
her	1
house	1
who	1
would	1
wait	1
upon	1
him	1
to	1
his	1
full	1
satisfaction.	1
“The	1
truth	1
is,	1
señora,”	1
replied	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“that	1
I	1
do	1
feel	1
the	1
loss	1
of	1
Sancho;	1
but	1
that	1
is	1
not	1
the	1
main	1
cause	1
of	1
my	1
looking	1
sad;	1
and	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
offers	1
your	1
excellence	1
makes	1
me,	1
I	1
accept	1
only	1
the	1
good-will	1
with	1
which	1
they	1
are	1
made,	1
and	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
remainder	1
I	1
entreat	1
of	1
your	1
excellence	1
to	1
permit	1
and	1
allow	1
me	1
alone	1
to	1
wait	1
upon	1
myself	1
in	1
my	1
chamber.”	1
“Indeed,	1
Señor	1
Don	1
Quixote,”	1
said	1
the	1
duchess,	1
“that	1
must	1
not	1
be;	1
four	1
of	1
my	1
damsels,	1
as	1
beautiful	1
as	1
flowers,	1
shall	1
wait	1
upon	1
you.”	1
“To	1
me,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“they	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
flowers,	1
but	1
thorns	1
to	1
pierce	1
my	1
heart.	1
They,	1
or	1
anything	1
like	1
them,	1
shall	1
as	1
soon	1
enter	1
my	1
chamber	1
as	1
fly.	1
If	1
your	1
highness	1
wishes	1
to	1
gratify	1
me	1
still	1
further,	1
though	1
I	1
deserve	1
it	1
not,	1
permit	1
me	1
to	1
please	1
myself,	1
and	1
wait	1
upon	1
myself	1
in	1
my	1
own	1
room;	1
for	1
I	1
place	1
a	1
barrier	1
between	1
my	1
inclinations	1
and	1
my	1
virtue,	1
and	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
wish	1
to	1
break	1
this	1
rule	1
through	1
the	1
generosity	1
your	1
highness	1
is	1
disposed	1
to	1
display	1
towards	1
me;	1
and,	1
in	1
short,	1
I	1
will	1
sleep	1
in	1
my	1
clothes,	1
sooner	1
than	1
allow	1
anyone	1
to	1
undress	1
me.”	1
“Say	1
no	1
more,	1
Señor	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
say	1
no	1
more,”	1
said	1
the	1
duchess;	1
“I	1
assure	1
you	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
orders	1
that	1
not	1
even	1
a	1
fly,	1
not	1
to	1
say	1
a	1
damsel,	1
shall	1
enter	1
your	1
room.	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
the	1
one	1
to	1
undermine	1
the	1
propriety	1
of	1
Señor	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
for	1
it	1
strikes	1
me	1
that	1
among	1
his	1
many	1
virtues	1
the	1
one	1
that	1
is	1
pre-eminent	1
is	1
that	1
of	1
modesty.	1
Your	1
worship	1
may	1
undress	1
and	1
dress	1
in	1
private	1
and	1
in	1
your	1
own	1
way,	1
as	1
you	1
please	1
and	1
when	1
you	1
please,	1
for	1
there	1
will	1
be	1
no	1
one	1
to	1
hinder	1
you;	1
and	1
in	1
your	1
chamber	1
you	1
will	1
find	1
all	1
the	1
utensils	1
requisite	1
to	1
supply	1
the	1
wants	1
of	1
one	1
who	1
sleeps	1
with	1
his	1
door	1
locked,	1
to	1
the	1
end	1
that	1
no	1
natural	1
needs	1
compel	1
you	1
to	1
open	1
it.	1
May	1
the	1
great	1
Dulcinea	1
del	1
Toboso	1
live	1
a	1
thousand	1
years,	1
and	1
may	1
her	1
fame	1
extend	1
all	1
over	1
the	1
surface	1
of	1
the	1
globe,	1
for	1
she	1
deserves	1
to	1
be	1
loved	1
by	1
a	1
knight	1
so	1
valiant	1
and	1
so	1
virtuous;	1
and	1
may	1
kind	1
heaven	1
infuse	1
zeal	1
into	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
our	1
governor	1
Sancho	1
Panza	1
to	1
finish	1
off	1
his	1
discipline	1
speedily,	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
world	1
may	1
once	1
more	1
enjoy	1
the	1
beauty	1
of	1
so	1
grand	1
a	1
lady.”	1
To	1
which	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
replied,	1
“Your	1
highness	1
has	1
spoken	1
like	1
what	1
you	1
are;	1
from	1
the	1
mouth	1
of	1
a	1
noble	1
lady	1
nothing	1
bad	1
can	1
come;	1
and	1
Dulcinea	1
will	1
be	1
more	1
fortunate,	1
and	1
better	1
known	1
to	1
the	1
world	1
by	1
the	1
praise	1
of	1
your	1
highness	1
than	1
by	1
all	1
the	1
eulogies	1
the	1
greatest	1
orators	1
on	1
earth	1
could	1
bestow	1
upon	1
her.”	1
“Well,	1
well,	1
Señor	1
Don	1
Quixote,”	1
said	1
the	1
duchess,	1
it	1
is	1
nearly	1
supper-time,	1
and	1
the	1
duke	1
is	1
probably	1
waiting;	1
come	1
let	1
us	1
go	1
to	1
supper,	1
and	1
retire	1
to	1
rest	1
early,	1
for	1
the	1
journey	1
you	1
made	1
yesterday	1
from	1
Kandy	1
was	1
not	1
such	1
a	1
short	1
one	1
but	1
that	1
it	1
must	1
have	1
caused	1
you	1
some	1
fatigue.”	1
“I	1
feel	1
none,	1
señora,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“for	1
I	1
would	1
go	1
so	1
far	1
as	1
to	1
swear	1
to	1
your	1
excellence	1
that	1
in	1
all	1
my	1
life	1
I	1
never	1
mounted	1
a	1
quieter	1
beast,	1
or	1
a	1
pleasanter	1
paced	1
one,	1
than	1
Clavileño;	1
and	1
I	1
don’t	1
know	1
what	1
could	1
have	1
induced	1
Malambruno	1
to	1
discard	1
a	1
steed	1
so	1
swift	1
and	1
so	1
gentle,	1
and	1
burn	1
it	1
so	1
recklessly	1
as	1
he	1
did.”	1
“Probably,”	1
said	1
the	1
duchess,	1
“repenting	1
of	1
the	1
evil	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
to	1
the	1
Trifaldi	1
and	1
company,	1
and	1
others,	1
and	1
the	1
crimes	1
he	1
must	1
have	1
committed	1
as	1
a	1
wizard	1
and	1
enchanter,	1
he	1
resolved	1
to	1
make	1
away	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
instruments	1
of	1
his	1
craft;	1
and	1
so	1
burned	1
Clavileño	1
as	1
the	1
chief	1
one,	1
and	1
that	1
which	1
mainly	1
kept	1
him	1
restless,	1
wandering	1
from	1
land	1
to	1
land;	1
and	1
by	1
its	1
ashes	1
and	1
the	1
trophy	1
of	1
the	1
placard	1
the	1
valour	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
of	1
La	1
Mancha	1
is	1
established	1
for	1
ever.”	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
renewed	1
his	1
thanks	1
to	1
the	1
duchess;	1
and	1
having	1
supped,	1
retired	1
to	1
his	1
chamber	1
alone,	1
refusing	1
to	1
allow	1
anyone	1
to	1
enter	1
with	1
him	1
to	1
wait	1
on	1
him,	1
such	1
was	1
his	1
fear	1
of	1
encountering	1
temptations	1
that	1
might	1
lead	1
or	1
drive	1
him	1
to	1
forget	1
his	1
chaste	1
fidelity	1
to	1
his	1
lady	1
Dulcinea;	1
for	1
he	1
had	1
always	1
present	1
to	1
his	1
mind	1
the	1
virtue	1
of	1
Amadis,	1
that	1
flower	1
and	1
mirror	1
of	1
knights-errant.	1
He	1
locked	1
the	1
door	1
behind	1
him,	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
two	1
wax	1
candles	1
undressed	1
himself,	1
but	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
taking	1
off	1
his	1
stockings—O	1
disaster	1
unworthy	1
of	1
such	1
a	1
personage!—there	1
came	1
a	1
burst,	1
not	1
of	1
sighs,	1
or	1
anything	1
belying	1
his	1
delicacy	1
or	1
good	1
breeding,	1
but	1
of	1
some	1
two	1
dozen	1
stitches	1
in	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
stockings,	1
that	1
made	1
it	1
look	1
like	1
a	1
window-lattice.	1
The	1
worthy	1
gentleman	1
was	1
beyond	1
measure	1
distressed,	1
and	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
given	1
an	1
ounce	1
of	1
silver	1
to	1
have	1
had	1
half	1
a	1
drachm	1
of	1
green	1
silk	1
there;	1
I	1
say	1
green	1
silk,	1
because	1
the	1
stockings	1
were	1
green.	1
Here	1
Cide	1
Hamete	1
exclaimed	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
writing,	1
“O	1
poverty,	1
poverty!	1
I	1
know	1
not	1
what	1
could	1
have	1
possessed	1
the	1
great	1
Cordovan	1
poet	1
to	1
call	1
thee	1
‘holy	1
gift	1
ungratefully	1
received.’	1
Although	1
a	1
Moor,	1
I	1
know	1
well	1
enough	1
from	1
the	1
intercourse	1
I	1
have	1
had	1
with	1
Christians	1
that	1
holiness	1
consists	1
in	1
charity,	1
humility,	1
faith,	1
obedience,	1
and	1
poverty;	1
but	1
for	1
all	1
that,	1
I	1
say	1
he	1
must	1
have	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
of	1
godliness	1
who	1
can	1
find	1
any	1
satisfaction	1
in	1
being	1
poor;	1
unless,	1
indeed,	1
it	1
be	1
the	1
kind	1
of	1
poverty	1
one	1
of	1
their	1
greatest	1
saints	1
refers	1
to,	1
saying,	1
‘possess	1
all	1
things	1
as	1
though	1
ye	1
possessed	1
them	1
not;’	1
which	1
is	1
what	1
they	1
call	1
poverty	1
in	1
spirit.	1
But	1
thou,	1
that	1
other	1
poverty—for	1
it	1
is	1
of	1
thee	1
I	1
am	1
speaking	1
now—why	1
dost	1
thou	1
love	1
to	1
fall	1
out	1
with	1
gentlemen	1
and	1
men	1
of	1
good	1
birth	1
more	1
than	1
with	1
other	1
people?	1
Why	1
dost	1
thou	1
compel	1
them	1
to	1
smear	1
the	1
cracks	1
in	1
their	1
shoes,	1
and	1
to	1
have	1
the	1
buttons	1
of	1
their	1
coats,	1
one	1
silk,	1
another	1
hair,	1
and	1
another	1
glass?	1
Why	1
must	1
their	1
ruffs	1
be	1
always	1
crinkled	1
like	1
endive	1
leaves,	1
and	1
not	1
crimped	1
with	1
a	1
crimping	1
iron?”	1
(From	1
this	1
we	1
may	1
perceive	1
the	1
antiquity	1
of	1
starch	1
and	1
crimped	1
ruffs.)	1
Then	1
he	1
goes	1
on:	1
“Poor	1
gentleman	1
of	1
good	1
family!	1
always	1
cockering	1
up	1
his	1
honour,	1
dining	1
miserably	1
and	1
in	1
secret,	1
and	1
making	1
a	1
hypocrite	1
of	1
the	1
toothpick	1
with	1
which	1
he	1
sallies	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
street	1
after	1
eating	1
nothing	1
to	1
oblige	1
him	1
to	1
use	1
it!	1
Poor	1
fellow,	1
I	1
say,	1
with	1
his	1
nervous	1
honour,	1
fancying	1
they	1
perceive	1
a	1
league	1
off	1
the	1
patch	1
on	1
his	1
shoe,	1
the	1
sweat-stains	1
on	1
his	1
hat,	1
the	1
shabbiness	1
of	1
his	1
cloak,	1
and	1
the	1
hunger	1
of	1
his	1
stomach!”	1
All	1
this	1
was	1
brought	1
home	1
to	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
by	1
the	1
bursting	1
of	1
his	1
stitches;	1
however,	1
he	1
comforted	1
himself	1
on	1
perceiving	1
that	1
Sancho	1
had	1
left	1
behind	1
a	1
pair	1
of	1
travelling	1
boots,	1
which	1
he	1
resolved	1
to	1
wear	1
the	1
next	1
day.	1
At	1
last	1
he	1
went	1
to	1
bed,	1
out	1
of	1
spirits	1
and	1
heavy	1
at	1
heart,	1
as	1
much	1
because	1
he	1
missed	1
Sancho	1
as	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
irreparable	1
disaster	1
to	1
his	1
stockings,	1
the	1
stitches	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
even	1
taken	1
up	1
with	1
silk	1
of	1
another	1
colour,	1
which	1
is	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
greatest	1
signs	1
of	1
poverty	1
a	1
gentleman	1
can	1
show	1
in	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
his	1
never-failing	1
embarrassments.	1
He	1
put	1
out	1
the	1
candles;	1
but	1
the	1
night	1
was	1
warm	1
and	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
sleep;	1
he	1
rose	1
from	1
his	1
bed	1
and	1
opened	1
slightly	1
a	1
grated	1
window	1
that	1
looked	1
out	1
on	1
a	1
beautiful	1
garden,	1
and	1
as	1
he	1
did	1
so	1
he	1
perceived	1
and	1
heard	1
people	1
walking	1
and	1
talking	1
in	1
the	1
garden.	1
He	1
set	1
himself	1
to	1
listen	1
attentively,	1
and	1
those	1
below	1
raised	1
their	1
voices	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
hear	1
these	1
words:	1
“Urge	1
me	1
not	1
to	1
sing,	1
Emerencia,	1
for	1
thou	1
knowest	1
that	1
ever	1
since	1
this	1
stranger	1
entered	1
the	1
castle	1
and	1
my	1
eyes	1
beheld	1
him,	1
I	1
cannot	1
sing	1
but	1
only	1
weep;	1
besides	1
my	1
lady	1
is	1
a	1
light	1
rather	1
than	1
a	1
heavy	1
sleeper,	1
and	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
wealth	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
that	1
she	1
found	1
us	1
here;	1
and	1
even	1
if	1
she	1
were	1
asleep	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
waken,	1
my	1
singing	1
would	1
be	1
in	1
vain,	1
if	1
this	1
strange	1
Æneas,	1
who	1
has	1
come	1
into	1
my	1
neighbourhood	1
to	1
flout	1
me,	1
sleeps	1
on	1
and	1
wakens	1
not	1
to	1
hear	1
it.”	1
“Heed	1
not	1
that,	1
dear	1
Altisidora,”	1
replied	1
a	1
voice;	1
“the	1
duchess	1
is	1
no	1
doubt	1
asleep,	1
and	1
everybody	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
save	1
the	1
lord	1
of	1
thy	1
heart	1
and	1
disturber	1
of	1
thy	1
soul;	1
for	1
just	1
now	1
I	1
perceived	1
him	1
open	1
the	1
grated	1
window	1
of	1
his	1
chamber,	1
so	1
he	1
must	1
be	1
awake;	1
sing,	1
my	1
poor	1
sufferer,	1
in	1
a	1
low	1
sweet	1
tone	1
to	1
the	1
accompaniment	1
of	1
thy	1
harp;	1
and	1
even	1
if	1
the	1
duchess	1
hears	1
us	1
we	1
can	1
lay	1
the	1
blame	1
on	1
the	1
heat	1
of	1
the	1
night.”	1
“That	1
is	1
not	1
the	1
point,	1
Emerencia,”	1
replied	1
Altisidora,	1
“it	1
is	1
that	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
that	1
my	1
singing	1
should	1
lay	1
bare	1
my	1
heart,	1
and	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
thought	1
a	1
light	1
and	1
wanton	1
maiden	1
by	1
those	1
who	1
know	1
not	1
the	1
mighty	1
power	1
of	1
love;	1
but	1
come	1
what	1
may;	1
better	1
a	1
blush	1
on	1
the	1
cheeks	1
than	1
a	1
sore	1
in	1
the	1
heart;”	1
and	1
here	1
a	1
harp	1
softly	1
touched	1
made	1
itself	1
heard.	1
As	1
he	1
listened	1
to	1
all	1
this	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
was	1
in	1
a	1
state	1
of	1
breathless	1
amazement,	1
for	1
immediately	1
the	1
countless	1
adventures	1
like	1
this,	1
with	1
windows,	1
gratings,	1
gardens,	1
serenades,	1
lovemakings,	1
and	1
languishings,	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
read	1
of	1
in	1
his	1
trashy	1
books	1
of	1
chivalry,	1
came	1
to	1
his	1
mind.	1
He	1
at	1
once	1
concluded	1
that	1
some	1
damsel	1
of	1
the	1
duchess’s	1
was	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
him,	1
and	1
that	1
her	1
modesty	1
forced	1
her	1
to	1
keep	1
her	1
passion	1
secret.	1
He	1
trembled	1
lest	1
he	1
should	1
fall,	1
and	1
made	1
an	1
inward	1
resolution	1
not	1
to	1
yield;	1
and	1
commending	1
himself	1
with	1
all	1
his	1
might	1
and	1
soul	1
to	1
his	1
lady	1
Dulcinea	1
he	1
made	1
up	1
his	1
mind	1
to	1
listen	1
to	1
the	1
music;	1
and	1
to	1
let	1
them	1
know	1
he	1
was	1
there	1
he	1
gave	1
a	1
pretended	1
sneeze,	1
at	1
which	1
the	1
damsels	1
were	1
not	1
a	1
little	1
delighted,	1
for	1
all	1
they	1
wanted	1
was	1
that	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
should	1
hear	1
them.	1
So	1
having	1
tuned	1
the	1
harp,	1
Altisidora,	1
running	1
her	1
hand	1
across	1
the	1
strings,	1
began	1
this	1
ballad:	1
O	1
thou	1
that	1
art	1
above	1
in	1
bed,	1
Between	1
the	1
holland	1
sheets,	1
A-lying	1
there	1
from	1
night	1
till	1
morn,	1
With	1
outstretched	1
legs	1
asleep;	1
O	1
thou,	1
most	1
valiant	1
knight	1
of	1
all	1
The	1
famed	1
Manchegan	1
breed,	1
Of	1
purity	1
and	1
virtue	1
more	1
Than	1
gold	1
of	1
Araby;	1
Give	1
ear	1
unto	1
a	1
suffering	1
maid,	1
Well-grown	1
but	1
evil-starr’d,	1
For	1
those	1
two	1
suns	1
of	1
thine	1
have	1
lit	1
A	1
fire	1
within	1
her	1
heart.	1
Adventures	1
seeking	1
thou	1
dost	1
rove,	1
To	1
others	1
bringing	1
woe;	1
Thou	1
scatterest	1
wounds,	1
but,	1
ah,	1
the	1
balm	1
To	1
heal	1
them	1
dost	1
withhold!	1
Say,	1
valiant	1
youth,	1
and	1
so	1
may	1
God	1
Thy	1
enterprises	1
speed,	1
Didst	1
thou	1
the	1
light	1
mid	1
Libya’s	1

O	1
Dulcinea	1
may	1
be	1
proud,	1
That	1
plump	1
and	1
lusty	1
maid;	1
For	1
she	1
alone	1
hath	1
had	1
the	1
power	1
A	1
tiger	1
fierce	1
to	1
tame.	1
And	1
she	1

From	1
Tagus	1

Jarama,	1
From	1
Manzanares	1
to	1
Genil,	1
From	1
Duero	1

Fain	1
would	1
I	1
change	1
with	1
her,	1
and	1
give	1
A	1
petticoat	1
to	1
boot,	1
The	1
best	1
and	1
bravest	1
that	1
I	1
have,	1
All	1
trimmed	1

O	1
for	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
happy	1
fair	1
Thy	1
mighty	1
arms	1
enfold,	1
Or	1
even	1
sit	1
beside	1
thy	1
bed	1
And	1
scratch	1
thy	1
dusty	1
poll!	1
I	1
rave,—to	1
favours	1
such	1
as	1
these	1
Unworthy	1
to	1
aspire;	1
Thy	1
feet	1
to	1
tickle	1
were	1
enough	1
For	1
one	1
so	1
mean	1
as	1
I.	1
What	1
caps,	1
what	1
slippers	1
silver-laced,	1
Would	1
I	1
on	1
thee	1
bestow!	1
What	1
damask	1
breeches	1
make	1
for	1
thee;	1
What	1
fine	1
long	1
holland	1
cloaks!	1
And	1
I	1
would	1
give	1
thee	1
pearls	1
that	1
should	1
As	1
big	1
as	1
oak-galls	1
show;	1
So	1
matchless	1
big	1
that	1
each	1
might	1
well	1
Be	1
called	1
the	1
great	1
“Alone.”	1
Manchegan	1
Nero,	1
look	1
not	1
down	1
From	1
thy	1
Tarpeian	1
Rock	1
Upon	1
this	1
burning	1
heart,	1
nor	1
add	1
The	1
fuel	1
of	1
thy	1
wrath.	1
A	1
virgin	1
soft	1
and	1
young	1
am	1
I,	1
Not	1
yet	1
fifteen	1
years	1
old;	1
(I’m	1
only	1
three	1
months	1
past	1
fourteen,	1
I	1
swear	1
upon	1
my	1
soul).	1
I	1
hobble	1
not	1
nor	1
do	1
I	1
limp,	1
All	1
blemish	1
I’m	1
without,	1
And	1
as	1
I	1
walk	1
my	1
lily	1
locks	1
Are	1
trailing	1
on	1
the	1
ground.	1
And	1
though	1
my	1
nose	1
be	1
rather	1
flat,	1
And	1
though	1
my	1
mouth	1
be	1
wide,	1
My	1
teeth	1
like	1
topazes	1
exalt	1
My	1
beauty	1
to	1
the	1
sky.	1
Thou	1
knowest	1
that	1
my	1
voice	1
is	1
sweet,	1
That	1
is	1
if	1
thou	1
dost	1
hear;	1
And	1
I	1
am	1
moulded	1
in	1
a	1
form	1
Somewhat	1
below	1
the	1
mean.	1
These	1
charms,	1
and	1
many	1
more,	1
are	1
thine,	1
Spoils	1
to	1
thy	1
spear	1
and	1
bow	1
all;	1
A	1
damsel	1
of	1
this	1
house	1
am	1
I,	1
By	1
name	1
Altisidora.	1

Here	1
the	1
lay	1
of	1
the	1
heart-stricken	1
Altisidora	1
came	1
to	1
an	1
end,	1
while	1
the	1
warmly	1
wooed	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
began	1
to	1
feel	1
alarm;	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
deep	1
sigh	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
himself,	1
“O	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
such	1
an	1
unlucky	1
knight	1
that	1
no	1
damsel	1
can	1
set	1
eyes	1
on	1
me	1
but	1
falls	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
me!	1
O	1
that	1
the	1
peerless	1
Dulcinea	1
should	1
be	1
so	1
unfortunate	1
that	1
they	1
cannot	1
let	1
her	1
enjoy	1
my	1
incomparable	1
constancy	1
in	1
peace!	1
What	1
would	1
ye	1
with	1
her,	1
ye	1
queens?	1
Why	1
do	1
ye	1
persecute	1
her,	1
ye	1
empresses?	1
Why	1
ye	1
pursue	1
her,	1
ye	1
virgins	1
of	1
from	1
fourteen	1
to	1
fifteen?	1
Leave	1
the	1
unhappy	1
being	1
to	1
triumph,	1
rejoice	1
and	1
glory	1
in	1
the	1
lot	1
love	1
has	1
been	1
pleased	1
to	1
bestow	1
upon	1
her	1
in	1
surrendering	1
my	1
heart	1
and	1
yielding	1
up	1
my	1
soul	1
to	1
her.	1
Ye	1
love-smitten	1
host,	1
know	1
that	1
to	1
Dulcinea	1
only	1
I	1
am	1
dough	1
and	1
sugar-paste,	1
flint	1
to	1
all	1
others;	1
for	1
her	1
I	1
am	1
honey,	1
for	1
you	1
aloes.	1
For	1
me	1
Dulcinea	1
alone	1
is	1
beautiful,	1
wise,	1
virtuous,	1
graceful,	1
and	1
high-bred,	1
and	1
all	1
others	1
are	1
ill-favoured,	1
foolish,	1
light,	1
and	1
low-born.	1
Nature	1
sent	1
me	1
into	1
the	1
world	1
to	1
be	1
hers	1
and	1
no	1
other’s;	1
Altisidora	1
may	1
weep	1
or	1
sing,	1
the	1
lady	1
for	1
whose	1
sake	1
they	1
belaboured	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
castle	1
of	1
the	1
enchanted	1
Moor	1
may	1
give	1
way	1
to	1
despair,	1
but	1
I	1
must	1
be	1
Dulcinea’s,	1
boiled	1
or	1
roast,	1
pure,	1
courteous,	1
and	1
chaste,	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
magic-working	1
powers	1
on	1
earth.”	1
And	1
with	1
that	1
he	1
shut	1
the	1
window	1
with	1
a	1
bang,	1
and,	1
as	1
much	1
out	1
of	1
temper	1

O	1

of	1
the	1

torch	1
of	1
the	1
world,	1

of	1

of	1

Thimbraeus	1

Phœbus	1
there,	1
now	1

now	1
physician,	1
father	1
of	1

inventor	1
of	1
music;	1
thou	1
that	1
always	1
risest	1
and,	1
notwithstanding	1
appearances,	1
never	1
settest!	1
To	1
thee,	1
O	1
Sun,	1
by	1
whose	1
aid	1
man	1
begetteth	1
man,	1
to	1
thee	1
I	1
appeal	1
to	1
help	1
me	1
and	1
lighten	1
the	1
darkness	1
of	1
my	1
wit	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
proceed	1
with	1
scrupulous	1
exactitude	1
in	1
giving	1
an	1
account	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
Sancho	1
Panza’s	1
government;	1
for	1
without	1
thee	1
I	1
feel	1
myself	1
weak,	1
feeble,	1
and	1
uncertain.	1
To	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
point,	1
then—Sancho	1
with	1
all	1
his	1
attendants	1
arrived	1
at	1
a	1
village	1
of	1
some	1
thousand	1
inhabitants,	1
and	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
largest	1
the	1
duke	1
possessed.	1
They	1
informed	1
him	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
called	1
the	1
island	1
of	1
Barataria,	1
either	1
because	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
village	1
was	1
Baratario,	1
or	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
joke	1
by	1
way	1
of	1
which	1
the	1
government	1
had	1
been	1
conferred	1
upon	1
him.	1
On	1
reaching	1
the	1
gates	1
of	1
the	1
town,	1
which	1
was	1
a	1
walled	1
one,	1
the	1
municipality	1
came	1
forth	1
to	1
meet	1
him,	1
the	1
bells	1
rang	1
out	1
a	1
peal,	1
and	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
showed	1
every	1
sign	1
of	1
general	1
satisfaction;	1
and	1
with	1
great	1
pomp	1
they	1
conducted	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
principal	1
church	1
to	1
give	1
thanks	1
to	1
God,	1
and	1
then	1
with	1
burlesque	1
ceremonies	1
they	1
presented	1
him	1
with	1
the	1
keys	1
of	1
the	1
town,	1
and	1
acknowledged	1
him	1
as	1
perpetual	1
governor	1
of	1
the	1
island	1
of	1
Barataria.	1
The	1
costume,	1
the	1
beard,	1
and	1
the	1
fat	1
squat	1
figure	1
of	1
the	1
new	1
governor	1
astonished	1
all	1
those	1
who	1
were	1
not	1
in	1
on	1
the	1
secret,	1
and	1
even	1
all	1
who	1
were,	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
not	1
a	1
few.	1
Finally,	1
leading	1
him	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
church	1
they	1
carried	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
judgment	1
seat	1
and	1
seated	1
him	1
on	1
it,	1
and	1
the	1
duke’s	1
majordomo	1
said	1
to	1
him,	1
“It	1
is	1
an	1
ancient	1
custom	1
in	1
this	1
island,	1
señor	1
governor,	1
that	1
he	1
who	1
comes	1
to	1
take	1
possession	1
of	1
this	1
famous	1
island	1
is	1
bound	1
to	1
answer	1
a	1
question	1
which	1
shall	1
be	1
put	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
which	1
must	1
be	1
a	1
somewhat	1
knotty	1
and	1
difficult	1
one;	1
and	1
by	1
his	1
answer	1
the	1
people	1
take	1
the	1
measure	1
of	1
their	1
new	1
governor’s	1
wit,	1
and	1
hail	1
with	1
joy	1
or	1
deplore	1
his	1
arrival	1
accordingly.”	1
While	1
the	1
majordomo	1
was	1
making	1
this	1
speech	1
Sancho	1
was	1
gazing	1
at	1
several	1
large	1
letters	1
inscribed	1
on	1
the	1
wall	1
opposite	1
his	1
seat,	1
and	1
as	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
read	1
he	1
asked	1
what	1
that	1
was	1
that	1
was	1
painted	1
on	1
the	1
wall.	1
The	1
answer	1
was,	1
“Señor,	1
there	1
is	1
written	1
and	1
recorded	1
the	1
day	1
on	1
which	1
your	1
lordship	1
took	1
possession	1
of	1
this	1
island,	1
and	1
the	1
inscription	1
says,	1
‘This	1
day,	1
the	1
so-and-so	1
of	1
such-and-such	1
a	1
month	1
and	1
year,	1
Señor	1
Don	1
Sancho	1
Panza	1
took	1
possession	1
of	1
this	1
island;	1
many	1
years	1
may	1
he	1
enjoy	1
it.’”	1
“And	1
whom	1
do	1
they	1
call	1
Don	1
Sancho	1
Panza?”	1
asked	1
Sancho.	1
“Your	1
lordship,”	1
replied	1
the	1
majordomo;	1
“for	1
no	1
other	1
Panza	1
but	1
the	1
one	1
who	1
is	1
now	1
seated	1
in	1
that	1
chair	1
has	1
ever	1
entered	1
this	1
island.”	1
“Well	1
then,	1
let	1
me	1
tell	1
you,	1
brother,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“I	1
haven’t	1
got	1
the	1
‘Don,’	1
nor	1
has	1
anyone	1
of	1
my	1
family	1
ever	1
had	1
it;	1
my	1
name	1
is	1
plain	1
Sancho	1
Panza,	1
and	1
Sancho	1
was	1
my	1
father’s	1
name,	1
and	1
Sancho	1
was	1
my	1
grandfather’s	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
Panzas,	1
without	1
any	1
Dons	1
or	1
Doñas	1
tacked	1
on;	1
I	1
suspect	1
that	1
in	1
this	1
island	1
there	1
are	1
more	1
Dons	1
than	1
stones;	1
but	1
never	1
mind;	1
God	1
knows	1
what	1
I	1
mean,	1
and	1
maybe	1
if	1
my	1
government	1
lasts	1
four	1
days	1
I’ll	1
weed	1
out	1
these	1
Dons	1
that	1
no	1
doubt	1
are	1
as	1
great	1
a	1
nuisance	1
as	1
the	1
midges,	1
they’re	1
so	1
plenty.	1
Let	1
the	1
majordomo	1
go	1
on	1
with	1
his	1
question,	1
and	1
I’ll	1
give	1
the	1
best	1
answer	1
I	1
can,	1
whether	1
the	1
people	1
deplore	1
or	1
not.”	1
At	1
this	1
instant	1
there	1
came	1
into	1
court	1
two	1
old	1
men,	1
one	1
carrying	1
a	1
cane	1
by	1
way	1
of	1
a	1
walking-stick,	1
and	1
the	1
one	1
who	1
had	1
no	1
stick	1
said,	1
“Señor,	1
some	1
time	1
ago	1
I	1
lent	1
this	1
good	1
man	1
ten	1
gold-crowns	1
in	1
gold	1
to	1
gratify	1
him	1
and	1
do	1
him	1
a	1
service,	1
on	1
the	1
condition	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
to	1
return	1
them	1
to	1
me	1
whenever	1
I	1
should	1
ask	1
for	1
them.	1
A	1
long	1
time	1
passed	1
before	1
I	1
asked	1
for	1
them,	1
for	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
put	1
him	1
to	1
any	1
greater	1
straits	1
to	1
return	1
them	1
than	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
when	1
I	1
lent	1
them	1
to	1
him;	1
but	1
thinking	1
he	1
was	1
growing	1
careless	1
about	1
payment	1
I	1
asked	1
for	1
them	1
once	1
and	1
several	1
times;	1
and	1
not	1
only	1
will	1
he	1
not	1
give	1
them	1
back,	1
but	1
he	1
denies	1
that	1
he	1
owes	1
them,	1
and	1
says	1
I	1
never	1
lent	1
him	1
any	1
such	1
crowns;	1
or	1
if	1
I	1
did,	1
that	1
he	1
repaid	1
them;	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
witnesses	1
either	1
of	1
the	1
loan,	1
or	1
the	1
payment,	1
for	1
he	1
never	1
paid	1
me;	1
I	1
want	1
your	1
worship	1
to	1
put	1
him	1
to	1
his	1
oath,	1
and	1
if	1
he	1
swears	1
he	1
returned	1
them	1
to	1
me	1
I	1
forgive	1
him	1
the	1
debt	1
here	1
and	1
before	1
God.”	1

“What	1
say	1
you	1
to	1
this,	1
good	1
old	1
man,	1
you	1
with	1
the	1
stick?”	1
said	1
Sancho.	1
To	1
which	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
replied,	1
“I	1
admit,	1
señor,	1
that	1
he	1
lent	1
them	1
to	1
me;	1
but	1
let	1
your	1
worship	1
lower	1
your	1
staff,	1
and	1
as	1
he	1
leaves	1
it	1
to	1
my	1
oath,	1
I’ll	1
swear	1
that	1
I	1
gave	1
them	1
back,	1
and	1
paid	1
him	1
really	1
and	1
truly.”	1
The	1
governor	1
lowered	1
the	1
staff,	1
and	1
as	1
he	1
did	1
so	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
who	1
had	1
the	1
stick	1
handed	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
old	1
man	1
to	1
hold	1
for	1
him	1
while	1
he	1
swore,	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
found	1
it	1
in	1
his	1
way;	1
and	1
then	1
laid	1
his	1
hand	1
on	1
the	1
cross	1
of	1
the	1
staff,	1
saying	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
true	1
the	1
ten	1
crowns	1
that	1
were	1
demanded	1
of	1
him	1
had	1
been	1
lent	1
him;	1
but	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
with	1
his	1
own	1
hand	1
given	1
them	1
back	1
into	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
the	1
other,	1
and	1
that	1
he,	1
not	1
recollecting	1
it,	1
was	1
always	1
asking	1
for	1
them.	1
Seeing	1
this	1
the	1
great	1
governor	1
asked	1
the	1
creditor	1
what	1
answer	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
make	1
to	1
what	1
his	1
opponent	1
said.	1
He	1
said	1
that	1
no	1
doubt	1
his	1
debtor	1
had	1
told	1
the	1
truth,	1
for	1
he	1
believed	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
an	1
honest	1
man	1
and	1
a	1
good	1
Christian,	1
and	1
he	1
himself	1
must	1
have	1
forgotten	1
when	1
and	1
how	1
he	1
had	1
given	1
him	1
back	1
the	1
crowns;	1
and	1
that	1
from	1
that	1
time	1
forth	1
he	1
would	1
make	1
no	1
further	1
demand	1
upon	1
him.	1
The	1
debtor	1
took	1
his	1
stick	1
again,	1
and	1
bowing	1
his	1
head	1
left	1
the	1
court.	1
Observing	1
this,	1
and	1
how,	1
without	1
another	1
word,	1
he	1
made	1
off,	1
and	1
observing	1
too	1
the	1
resignation	1
of	1
the	1
plaintiff,	1
Sancho	1
buried	1
his	1
head	1
in	1
his	1
bosom	1
and	1
remained	1
for	1
a	1
short	1
space	1
in	1
deep	1
thought,	1
with	1
the	1
forefinger	1
of	1
his	1
right	1
hand	1
on	1
his	1
brow	1
and	1
nose;	1
then	1
he	1
raised	1
his	1
head	1
and	1
bade	1
them	1
call	1
back	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
with	1
the	1
stick,	1
for	1
he	1
had	1
already	1
taken	1
his	1
departure.	1
They	1
brought	1
him	1
back,	1
and	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
Sancho	1
saw	1
him	1
he	1
said,	1
“Honest	1
man,	1
give	1
me	1
that	1
stick,	1
for	1
I	1
want	1
it.”	1
“Willingly,”	1
said	1
the	1
old	1
man;	1
“here	1
it	1
is	1
señor,”	1
and	1
he	1
put	1
it	1
into	1
his	1
hand.	1
Sancho	1
took	1
it	1
and,	1
handing	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
old	1
man,	1
said	1
to	1
him,	1
“Go,	1
and	1
God	1
be	1
with	1
you;	1
for	1
now	1
you	1
are	1
paid.”	1
“I,	1
señor!”	1
returned	1
the	1
old	1
man;	1
“why,	1
is	1
this	1
cane	1
worth	1
ten	1
gold-crowns?”	1
“Yes,”	1
said	1
the	1
governor,	1
“or	1
if	1
not	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
greatest	1
dolt	1
in	1
the	1
world;	1
now	1
you	1
will	1
see	1
whether	1
I	1
have	1
got	1
the	1
headpiece	1
to	1
govern	1
a	1
whole	1
kingdom;”	1
and	1
he	1
ordered	1
the	1
cane	1
to	1
be	1
broken	1
in	1
two,	1
there,	1
in	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
all.	1
It	1
was	1
done,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
it	1
they	1
found	1
ten	1
gold-crowns.	1
All	1
were	1
filled	1
with	1
amazement,	1
and	1
looked	1
upon	1
their	1
governor	1
as	1
another	1
Solomon.	1
They	1
asked	1
him	1
how	1
he	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
conclusion	1
that	1
the	1
ten	1
crowns	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
cane;	1
he	1
replied,	1
that	1
observing	1
how	1
the	1
old	1
man	1
who	1
swore	1
gave	1
the	1
stick	1
to	1
his	1
opponent	1
while	1
he	1
was	1
taking	1
the	1
oath,	1
and	1
swore	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
really	1
and	1
truly	1
given	1
him	1
the	1
crowns,	1
and	1
how	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
swearing	1
he	1
asked	1
for	1
the	1
stick	1
again,	1
it	1
came	1
into	1
his	1
head	1
that	1
the	1
sum	1
demanded	1
must	1
be	1
inside	1
it;	1
and	1
from	1
this	1
he	1
said	1
it	1
might	1
be	1
seen	1
that	1
God	1
sometimes	1
guides	1
those	1
who	1
govern	1
in	1
their	1
judgments,	1
even	1
though	1
they	1
may	1
be	1
fools;	1
besides	1
he	1
had	1
himself	1
heard	1
the	1
curate	1
of	1
his	1
village	1
mention	1
just	1
such	1
another	1
case,	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
so	1
good	1
a	1
memory,	1
that	1
if	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
that	1
he	1
forgot	1
everything	1
he	1
wished	1
to	1
remember,	1
there	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
such	1
a	1
memory	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
island.	1
To	1
conclude,	1
the	1
old	1
men	1
went	1
off,	1
one	1
crestfallen,	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
in	1
high	1
contentment,	1
all	1
who	1
were	1
present	1
were	1
astonished,	1
and	1
he	1
who	1
was	1
recording	1
the	1
words,	1
deeds,	1
and	1
movements	1
of	1
Sancho	1
could	1
not	1
make	1
up	1
his	1
mind	1
whether	1
he	1
was	1
to	1
look	1
upon	1
him	1
and	1
set	1
him	1
down	1
as	1
a	1
fool	1
or	1
as	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
sense.	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
this	1
case	1
was	1
disposed	1
of,	1
there	1
came	1
into	1
court	1
a	1
woman	1
holding	1
on	1
with	1
a	1
tight	1
grip	1
to	1
a	1
man	1
dressed	1
like	1
a	1
well-to-do	1
cattle	1
dealer,	1
and	1
she	1
came	1
forward	1
making	1
a	1
great	1
outcry	1
and	1
exclaiming,	1
“Justice,	1
señor	1
governor,	1
justice!	1
and	1
if	1
I	1
don’t	1
get	1
it	1
on	1
earth	1
I’ll	1
go	1
look	1
for	1
it	1
in	1
heaven.	1
Señor	1
governor	1
of	1
my	1
soul,	1
this	1
wicked	1
man	1
caught	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
fields	1
here	1
and	1
used	1
my	1
body	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
was	1
an	1
ill-washed	1
rag,	1
and,	1
woe	1
is	1
me!	1
got	1
from	1
me	1
what	1
I	1
had	1
kept	1
these	1
three-and-twenty	1
years	1
and	1
more,	1
defending	1
it	1
against	1
Moors	1
and	1
Christians,	1
natives	1
and	1
strangers;	1
and	1
I	1
always	1
as	1
hard	1
as	1
an	1
oak,	1
and	1
keeping	1
myself	1
as	1
pure	1
as	1
a	1
salamander	1
in	1
the	1
fire,	1
or	1
wool	1
among	1
the	1
brambles,	1
for	1
this	1
good	1
fellow	1
to	1
come	1
now	1
with	1
clean	1
hands	1
to	1
handle	1
me!”	1
“It	1
remains	1
to	1
be	1
proved	1
whether	1
this	1
gallant	1
has	1
clean	1
hands	1
or	1
not,”	1
said	1
Sancho;	1
and	1
turning	1
to	1
the	1
man	1
he	1
asked	1
him	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
say	1
in	1
answer	1
to	1
the	1
woman’s	1
charge.	1
He	1
all	1
in	1
confusion	1
made	1
answer,	1
“Sirs,	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
poor	1
pig	1
dealer,	1
and	1
this	1
morning	1
I	1
left	1
the	1
village	1
to	1
sell	1
(saving	1
your	1
presence)	1
four	1
pigs,	1
and	1
between	1
dues	1
and	1
cribbings	1
they	1
got	1
out	1
of	1
me	1
little	1
less	1
than	1
the	1
worth	1
of	1
them.	1
As	1
I	1
was	1
returning	1
to	1
my	1
village	1
I	1
fell	1
in	1
on	1
the	1
road	1
with	1
this	1
good	1
dame,	1
and	1
the	1
devil	1
who	1
makes	1
a	1
coil	1
and	1
a	1
mess	1
out	1
of	1
everything,	1
yoked	1
us	1
together.	1
I	1
paid	1
her	1
fairly,	1
but	1
she	1
not	1
contented	1
laid	1
hold	1
of	1
me	1
and	1
never	1
let	1
go	1
until	1
she	1
brought	1
me	1
here;	1
she	1
says	1
I	1
forced	1
her,	1
but	1
she	1
lies	1
by	1
the	1
oath	1
I	1
swear	1
or	1
am	1
ready	1
to	1
swear;	1
and	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
whole	1
truth	1
and	1
every	1
particle	1
of	1
it.”	1
The	1
governor	1
on	1
this	1
asked	1
him	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
any	1
money	1
in	1
silver	1
about	1
him;	1
he	1
said	1
he	1
had	1
about	1
twenty	1
ducats	1
in	1
a	1
leather	1
purse	1
in	1
his	1
bosom.	1
The	1
governor	1
bade	1
him	1
take	1
it	1
out	1
and	1
hand	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
complainant;	1
he	1
obeyed	1
trembling;	1
the	1
woman	1
took	1
it,	1
and	1
making	1
a	1
thousand	1
salaams	1
to	1
all	1
and	1
praying	1
to	1
God	1
for	1
the	1
long	1
life	1
and	1
health	1
of	1
the	1
señor	1
governor	1
who	1
had	1
such	1
regard	1
for	1
distressed	1
orphans	1
and	1
virgins,	1
she	1
hurried	1
out	1
of	1
court	1
with	1
the	1
purse	1
grasped	1
in	1
both	1
her	1
hands,	1
first	1
looking,	1
however,	1
to	1
see	1
if	1
the	1
money	1
it	1
contained	1
was	1
silver.	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
she	1
was	1
gone	1
Sancho	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
cattle	1
dealer,	1
whose	1
tears	1
were	1
already	1
starting	1
and	1
whose	1
eyes	1
and	1
heart	1
were	1
following	1
his	1
purse,	1
“Good	1
fellow,	1
go	1
after	1
that	1
woman	1
and	1
take	1
the	1
purse	1
from	1
her,	1
by	1
force	1
even,	1
and	1
come	1
back	1
with	1
it	1
here;”	1
and	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
say	1
it	1
to	1
one	1
who	1
was	1
a	1
fool	1
or	1
deaf,	1
for	1
the	1
man	1
was	1
off	1
like	1
a	1
flash	1
of	1
lightning,	1
and	1
ran	1
to	1
do	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
bid.	1
All	1
the	1
bystanders	1
waited	1
anxiously	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
case,	1
and	1
presently	1
both	1
man	1
and	1
woman	1
came	1
back	1
at	1
even	1
closer	1
grips	1
than	1
before,	1
she	1
with	1
her	1
petticoat	1
up	1
and	1
the	1
purse	1
in	1
the	1
lap	1
of	1
it,	1
and	1
he	1
struggling	1
hard	1
to	1
take	1
it	1
from	1
her,	1
but	1
all	1
to	1
no	1
purpose,	1
so	1
stout	1
was	1
the	1
woman’s	1
defence,	1
she	1
all	1
the	1
while	1
crying	1
out,	1
“Justice	1
from	1
God	1
and	1
the	1
world!	1
see	1
here,	1
señor	1
governor,	1
the	1
shamelessness	1
and	1
boldness	1
of	1
this	1
villain,	1
who	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
town,	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
street,	1
wanted	1
to	1
take	1
from	1
me	1
the	1
purse	1
your	1
worship	1
bade	1
him	1
give	1
me.”	1
“And	1
did	1
he	1
take	1
it?”	1
asked	1
the	1
governor.	1
“Take	1
it!”	1
said	1
the	1
woman;	1
“I’d	1
let	1
my	1
life	1
be	1
taken	1
from	1
me	1
sooner	1
than	1
the	1
purse.	1
A	1
pretty	1
child	1
I’d	1
be!	1
It’s	1
another	1
sort	1
of	1
cat	1
they	1
must	1
throw	1
in	1
my	1
face,	1
and	1
not	1
that	1
poor	1
scurvy	1
knave.	1
Pincers	1
and	1
hammers,	1
mallets	1
and	1
chisels	1
would	1
not	1
get	1
it	1
out	1
of	1
my	1
grip;	1
no,	1
nor	1
lions’	1
claws;	1
the	1
soul	1
from	1
out	1
of	1
my	1
body	1
first!”	1
“She	1
is	1
right,”	1
said	1
the	1
man;	1
“I	1
own	1
myself	1
beaten	1
and	1
powerless;	1
I	1
confess	1
I	1
haven’t	1
the	1
strength	1
to	1
take	1
it	1
from	1
her;”	1
and	1
he	1
let	1
go	1
his	1
hold	1
of	1
her.	1
Upon	1
this	1
the	1
governor	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
woman,	1
“Let	1
me	1
see	1
that	1
purse,	1
my	1
worthy	1
and	1
sturdy	1
friend.”	1
She	1
handed	1
it	1
to	1
him	1
at	1
once,	1
and	1
the	1
governor	1
returned	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
man,	1
and	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
unforced	1
mistress	1
of	1
force,	1
“Sister,	1
if	1
you	1
had	1
shown	1
as	1
much,	1
or	1
only	1
half	1
as	1
much,	1
spirit	1
and	1
vigour	1
in	1
defending	1
your	1
body	1
as	1
you	1
have	1
shown	1
in	1
defending	1
that	1
purse,	1
the	1
strength	1
of	1
Hercules	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
forced	1
you.	1
Be	1
off,	1
and	1
God	1
speed	1
you,	1
and	1
bad	1
luck	1
to	1
you,	1
and	1
don’t	1
show	1
your	1
face	1
in	1
all	1
this	1
island,	1
or	1
within	1
six	1
leagues	1
of	1
it	1
on	1
any	1
side,	1
under	1
pain	1
of	1
two	1
hundred	1
lashes;	1
be	1
off	1
at	1
once,	1
I	1
say,	1
you	1
shameless,	1
cheating	1
shrew.”	1
The	1
woman	1
was	1
cowed	1
and	1
went	1
off	1
disconsolately,	1
hanging	1
her	1
head;	1
and	1
the	1
governor	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
man,	1
“Honest	1
man,	1
go	1
home	1
with	1
your	1
money,	1
and	1
God	1
speed	1
you;	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
future,	1
if	1
you	1
don’t	1
want	1
to	1
lose	1
it,	1
see	1
that	1
you	1
don’t	1
take	1
it	1
into	1
your	1
head	1
to	1
yoke	1
with	1
anybody.”	1
The	1
man	1
thanked	1
him	1
as	1
clumsily	1
as	1
he	1
could	1
and	1
went	1
his	1
way,	1
and	1
the	1
bystanders	1
were	1
again	1
filled	1
with	1
admiration	1
at	1
their	1
new	1
governor’s	1
judgments	1
and	1
sentences.	1
Next,	1
two	1
men,	1
one	1
apparently	1
a	1
farm	1
labourer,	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
a	1
tailor,	1
for	1
he	1
had	1
a	1
pair	1
of	1
shears	1
in	1
his	1
hand,	1
presented	1
themselves	1
before	1
him,	1
and	1
the	1
tailor	1
said,	1
“Señor	1
governor,	1
this	1
labourer	1
and	1
I	1
come	1
before	1
your	1
worship	1
by	1
reason	1
of	1
this	1
honest	1
man	1
coming	1
to	1
my	1
shop	1
yesterday	1
(for	1
saving	1
everybody’s	1
presence	1
I’m	1
a	1
passed	1
tailor,	1
God	1
be	1
thanked),	1
and	1
putting	1
a	1
piece	1
of	1
cloth	1
into	1
my	1
hands	1
and	1
asking	1
me,	1
‘Señor,	1
will	1
there	1
be	1
enough	1
in	1
this	1
cloth	1
to	1
make	1
me	1
a	1
cap?’	1
Measuring	1
the	1
cloth	1
I	1
said	1
there	1
would.	1
He	1
probably	1
suspected—as	1
I	1
supposed,	1
and	1
I	1
supposed	1
right—that	1
I	1
wanted	1
to	1
steal	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
cloth,	1
led	1
to	1
think	1
so	1
by	1
his	1
own	1
roguery	1
and	1
the	1
bad	1
opinion	1
people	1
have	1
of	1
tailors;	1
and	1
he	1
told	1
me	1
to	1
see	1
if	1
there	1
would	1
be	1
enough	1
for	1
two.	1
I	1
guessed	1
what	1
he	1
would	1
be	1
at,	1
and	1
I	1
said	1
‘yes.’	1
He,	1
still	1
following	1
up	1
his	1
original	1
unworthy	1
notion,	1
went	1
on	1
adding	1
cap	1
after	1
cap,	1
and	1
I	1
‘yes’	1
after	1
‘yes,’	1
until	1
we	1
got	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
five.	1
He	1
has	1
just	1
this	1
moment	1
come	1
for	1
them;	1
I	1
gave	1
them	1
to	1
him,	1
but	1
he	1
won’t	1
pay	1
me	1
for	1
the	1
making;	1
on	1
the	1
contrary,	1
he	1
calls	1
upon	1
me	1
to	1
pay	1
him,	1
or	1
else	1
return	1
his	1
cloth.”	1
“Is	1
all	1
this	1
true,	1
brother?”	1
said	1
Sancho.	1
“Yes,”	1
replied	1
the	1
man;	1
“but	1
will	1
your	1
worship	1
make	1
him	1
show	1
the	1
five	1
caps	1
he	1
has	1
made	1
me?”	1
“With	1
all	1
my	1
heart,”	1
said	1
the	1
tailor;	1
and	1
drawing	1
his	1
hand	1
from	1
under	1
his	1
cloak	1
he	1
showed	1
five	1
caps	1
stuck	1
upon	1
the	1
five	1
fingers	1
of	1
it,	1
and	1
said,	1
“there	1
are	1
the	1
caps	1
this	1
good	1
man	1
asks	1
for;	1
and	1
by	1
God	1
and	1
upon	1
my	1
conscience	1
I	1
haven’t	1
a	1
scrap	1
of	1
cloth	1
left,	1
and	1
I’ll	1
let	1
the	1
work	1
be	1
examined	1
by	1
the	1
inspectors	1
of	1
the	1
trade.”	1
All	1
present	1
laughed	1
at	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
caps	1
and	1
the	1
novelty	1
of	1
the	1
suit;	1
Sancho	1
set	1
himself	1
to	1
think	1
for	1
a	1
moment,	1
and	1
then	1
said,	1
“It	1
seems	1
to	1
me	1
that	1
in	1
this	1
case	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
necessary	1
to	1
deliver	1
long-winded	1
arguments,	1
but	1
only	1
to	1
give	1
off-hand	1
the	1
judgment	1
of	1
an	1
honest	1
man;	1
and	1
so	1
my	1
decision	1
is	1
that	1
the	1
tailor	1
lose	1
the	1
making	1
and	1
the	1
labourer	1
the	1
cloth,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
caps	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
prisoners	1
in	1
the	1
gaol,	1
and	1
let	1
there	1
be	1
no	1
more	1
about	1
it.”	1
If	1
the	1
previous	1
decision	1
about	1
the	1
cattle	1
dealer’s	1
purse	1
excited	1
the	1
admiration	1
of	1
the	1
bystanders,	1
this	1
provoked	1
their	1
laughter;	1
however,	1
the	1
governor’s	1
orders	1
were	1
after	1
all	1
executed.	1
All	1
this,	1
having	1
been	1
taken	1
down	1
by	1
his	1
chronicler,	1
was	1
at	1
once	1
despatched	1
to	1
the	1
duke,	1
who	1
was	1
looking	1
out	1
for	1
it	1
with	1
great	1
eagerness;	1
and	1
here	1
let	1
us	1
leave	1
the	1
good	1
Sancho;	1
for	1
his	1
master,	1
sorely	1
troubled	1
in	1
mind	1
by	1
Altisidora’s	1
music,	1
has	1
pressing	1
claims	1
upon	1
us	1
now.	1

We	1
left	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
wrapped	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
reflections	1
which	1
the	1
music	1
of	1
the	1
enamourned	1
maid	1
Altisidora	1
had	1
given	1
rise	1
to.	1
He	1
went	1
to	1
bed	1
with	1
them,	1
and	1
just	1
like	1
fleas	1
they	1
would	1
not	1
let	1
him	1
sleep	1
or	1
get	1
a	1
moment’s	1
rest,	1
and	1
the	1
broken	1
stitches	1
of	1
his	1
stockings	1
helped	1
them.	1
But	1
as	1
Time	1
is	1
fleet	1
and	1
no	1
obstacle	1
can	1
stay	1
his	1
course,	1
he	1
came	1
riding	1
on	1
the	1
hours,	1
and	1
morning	1
very	1
soon	1
arrived.	1
Seeing	1
which	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
quitted	1
the	1
soft	1
down,	1
and,	1
nowise	1
slothful,	1
dressed	1
himself	1
in	1
his	1
chamois	1
suit	1
and	1
put	1
on	1
his	1
travelling	1
boots	1
to	1
hide	1
the	1
disaster	1
to	1
his	1
stockings.	1
He	1
threw	1
over	1
him	1
his	1
scarlet	1
mantle,	1
put	1
on	1
his	1
head	1
a	1
montera	1
of	1
green	1
velvet	1
trimmed	1
with	1
silver	1
edging,	1
flung	1
across	1
his	1
shoulder	1
the	1
baldric	1
with	1
his	1
good	1
trenchant	1
sword,	1
took	1
up	1
a	1
large	1
rosary	1
that	1
he	1
always	1
carried	1
with	1
him,	1
and	1
with	1
great	1
solemnity	1
and	1
precision	1
of	1
gait	1
proceeded	1
to	1
the	1
antechamber	1
where	1
the	1
duke	1
and	1
duchess	1
were	1
already	1
dressed	1
and	1
waiting	1
for	1
him.	1
But	1
as	1
he	1
passed	1
through	1
a	1
gallery,	1
Altisidora	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
damsel,	1
her	1
friend,	1
were	1
lying	1
in	1
wait	1
for	1
him,	1
and	1
the	1
instant	1
Altisidora	1
saw	1
him	1
she	1
pretended	1
to	1
faint,	1
while	1
her	1
friend	1
caught	1
her	1
in	1
her	1
lap,	1
and	1
began	1
hastily	1
unlacing	1
the	1
bosom	1
of	1
her	1
dress.	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
observed	1
it,	1
and	1
approaching	1
them	1
said,	1
“I	1
know	1
very	1
well	1
what	1
this	1
seizure	1
arises	1
from.”	1
“I	1
know	1
not	1
from	1
what,”	1
replied	1
the	1
friend,	1
“for	1
Altisidora	1
is	1
the	1
healthiest	1
damsel	1
in	1
all	1
this	1
house,	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
never	1
heard	1
her	1
complain	1
all	1
the	1
time	1
I	1
have	1
known	1
her.	1
A	1
plague	1
on	1
all	1
the	1
knights-errant	1
in	1
the	1
world,	1
if	1
they	1
be	1
all	1
ungrateful!	1
Go	1
away,	1
Señor	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
for	1
this	1
poor	1
child	1
will	1
not	1
come	1
to	1
herself	1
again	1
so	1
long	1
as	1
you	1
are	1
here.”	1

To	1
which	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
returned,	1
“Do	1
me	1
the	1
favour,	1
señora,	1
to	1
let	1
a	1
lute	1
be	1
placed	1
in	1
my	1
chamber	1
to-night;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
comfort	1
this	1
poor	1
maiden	1
to	1
the	1
best	1
of	1
my	1
power;	1
for	1
in	1
the	1
early	1
stages	1
of	1
love	1
a	1
prompt	1
disillusion	1
is	1
an	1
approved	1
remedy;”	1
and	1
with	1
this	1
he	1
retired,	1
so	1
as	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
remarked	1
by	1
any	1
who	1
might	1
see	1
him	1
there.	1
He	1
had	1
scarcely	1
withdrawn	1
when	1
Altisidora,	1
recovering	1
from	1
her	1
swoon,	1
said	1
to	1
her	1
companion,	1
“The	1
lute	1
must	1
be	1
left,	1
for	1
no	1
doubt	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
intends	1
to	1
give	1
us	1
some	1
music;	1
and	1
being	1
his	1
it	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
bad.”	1
They	1
went	1
at	1
once	1
to	1
inform	1
the	1
duchess	1
of	1
what	1
was	1
going	1
on,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
lute	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
asked	1
for,	1
and	1
she,	1
delighted	1
beyond	1
measure,	1
plotted	1
with	1
the	1
duke	1
and	1
her	1
two	1
damsels	1
to	1
play	1
him	1
a	1
trick	1
that	1
should	1
be	1
amusing	1
but	1
harmless;	1
and	1
in	1
high	1
glee	1
they	1
waited	1
for	1
night,	1
which	1
came	1
quickly	1
as	1
the	1
day	1
had	1
come;	1
and	1
as	1
for	1
the	1
day,	1
the	1
duke	1
and	1
duchess	1
spent	1
it	1
in	1
charming	1
conversation	1
with	1
Don	1
Quixote.	1
When	1
eleven	1
o’clock	1
came,	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
found	1
a	1
guitar	1
in	1
his	1
chamber;	1
he	1
tried	1
it,	1
opened	1
the	1
window,	1
and	1
perceived	1
that	1
some	1
persons	1
were	1
walking	1
in	1
the	1
garden;	1
and	1
having	1
passed	1
his	1
fingers	1
over	1
the	1
frets	1
of	1
the	1
guitar	1
and	1
tuned	1
it	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
he	1
could,	1
he	1
spat	1
and	1
cleared	1
his	1
chest,	1
and	1
then	1
with	1
a	1
voice	1
a	1
little	1
hoarse	1
but	1
full-toned,	1
he	1
sang	1
the	1
following	1
ballad,	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
himself	1
that	1
day	1
composed:	1
Mighty	1
Love	1
the	1
hearts	1
of	1
maidens	1
Doth	1
unsettle	1
and	1
perplex,	1
And	1
the	1
instrument	1
he	1
uses	1
Most	1
of	1
all	1
is	1
idleness.	1
Sewing,	1
stitching,	1
any	1
labour,	1
Having	1
always	1
work	1
to	1
do,	1
To	1
the	1
poison	1
Love	1
instilleth	1
Is	1
the	1
antidote	1
most	1
sure.	1
And	1
to	1
proper-minded	1
maidens	1
Who	1
desire	1
the	1
matron’s	1
name	1
Modesty’s	1
a	1
marriage	1
portion,	1
Modesty	1
their	1
highest	1
praise.	1
Men	1
of	1
prudence	1
and	1
discretion,	1
Courtiers	1
gay	1
and	1
gallant	1
knights,	1
With	1
the	1
wanton	1
damsels	1
dally,	1
But	1
the	1
modest	1
take	1
to	1
wife.	1
There	1
are	1
passions,	1
transient,	1
fleeting,	1
Loves	1
in	1
hostelries	1
declar’d,	1
Sunrise	1
loves,	1
with	1
sunset	1
ended,	1
When	1
the	1
guest	1
hath	1
gone	1
his	1
way.	1
Love	1
that	1
springs	1
up	1
swift	1
and	1
sudden,	1
Here	1
to-day,	1
to-morrow	1
flown,	1
Passes,	1
leaves	1
no	1
trace	1
behind	1
it,	1
Leaves	1
no	1
image	1
on	1
the	1
soul.	1
Painting	1
that	1
is	1
laid	1
on	1
painting	1
Maketh	1
no	1
display	1
or	1
show;	1
Where	1
one	1
beauty’s	1
in	1
possession	1
There	1
no	1
other	1
can	1
take	1
hold.	1
Dulcinea	1
del	1
Toboso	1
Painted	1
on	1
my	1
heart	1
I	1
wear;	1
Never	1
from	1
its	1
tablets,	1
never,	1
Can	1
her	1
image	1
be	1
eras’d.	1
The	1
quality	1
of	1
all	1
in	1
lovers	1
Most	1
esteemed	1
is	1
constancy;	1
’Tis	1
by	1
this	1
that	1
love	1
works	1
wonders,	1
This	1
exalts	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
skies.	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
had	1
got	1
so	1
far	1
with	1
his	1
song,	1
to	1
which	1
the	1
duke,	1
the	1
duchess,	1
Altisidora,	1
and	1
nearly	1
the	1
whole	1
household	1
of	1
the	1
castle	1
were	1
listening,	1
when	1
all	1
of	1
a	1
sudden	1
from	1
a	1
gallery	1
above	1
that	1
was	1
exactly	1
over	1
his	1
window	1
they	1
let	1
down	1
a	1
cord	1
with	1
more	1
than	1
a	1
hundred	1
bells	1
attached	1
to	1
it,	1
and	1
immediately	1
after	1
that	1
discharged	1
a	1
great	1
sack	1
full	1
of	1
cats,	1
which	1
also	1
had	1
bells	1
of	1
smaller	1
size	1
tied	1
to	1
their	1
tails.	1
Such	1
was	1
the	1
din	1
of	1
the	1
bells	1
and	1
the	1
squalling	1
of	1
the	1
cats,	1
that	1
though	1
the	1
duke	1
and	1
duchess	1
were	1
the	1
contrivers	1
of	1
the	1
joke	1
they	1
were	1
startled	1
by	1
it,	1
while	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
stood	1
paralysed	1
with	1
fear;	1
and	1
as	1
luck	1
would	1
have	1
it,	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
of	1
the	1
cats	1
made	1
their	1
way	1
in	1
through	1
the	1
grating	1
of	1
his	1
chamber,	1
and	1
flying	1
from	1
one	1
side	1
to	1
the	1
other,	1
made	1
it	1
seem	1
as	1
if	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
legion	1
of	1
devils	1
at	1
large	1
in	1
it.	1
They	1
extinguished	1
the	1
candles	1
that	1
were	1
burning	1
in	1
the	1
room,	1
and	1
rushed	1
about	1
seeking	1
some	1
way	1
of	1
escape;	1
the	1
cord	1
with	1
the	1
large	1
bells	1
never	1
ceased	1
rising	1
and	1
falling;	1
and	1
most	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
castle,	1
not	1
knowing	1
what	1
was	1
really	1
the	1
matter,	1
were	1
at	1
their	1
wits’	1
end	1
with	1
astonishment.	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
sprang	1
to	1
his	1
feet,	1
and	1
drawing	1
his	1
sword,	1
began	1
making	1
passes	1
at	1
the	1
grating,	1
shouting	1
out,	1
“Avaunt,	1
malignant	1
enchanters!	1
avaunt,	1
ye	1
witchcraft-working	1
rabble!	1
I	1
am	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
of	1
La	1
Mancha,	1
against	1
whom	1
your	1
evil	1
machinations	1
avail	1
not	1
nor	1
have	1
any	1
power.”	1
And	1
turning	1
upon	1
the	1
cats	1
that	1
were	1
running	1
about	1
the	1
room,	1
he	1
made	1
several	1
cuts	1
at	1
them.	1
They	1
dashed	1
at	1
the	1
grating	1
and	1
escaped	1
by	1
it,	1
save	1
one	1
that,	1
finding	1
itself	1
hard	1
pressed	1
by	1
the	1
slashes	1
of	1
Don	1
Quixote’s	1
sword,	1
flew	1
at	1
his	1
face	1
and	1
held	1
on	1
to	1
his	1
nose	1
tooth	1
and	1
nail,	1
with	1
the	1
pain	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
shout	1
his	1
loudest.	1
The	1
duke	1
and	1
duchess	1
hearing	1
this,	1
and	1
guessing	1
what	1
it	1
was,	1
ran	1
with	1
all	1
haste	1
to	1
his	1
room,	1
and	1
as	1
the	1
poor	1
gentleman	1
was	1
striving	1
with	1
all	1
his	1
might	1
to	1
detach	1
the	1
cat	1
from	1
his	1
face,	1
they	1
opened	1
the	1
door	1
with	1
a	1
master-key	1
and	1
went	1
in	1
with	1
lights	1
and	1
witnessed	1
the	1
unequal	1
combat.	1
The	1
duke	1
ran	1
forward	1
to	1
part	1
the	1
combatants,	1
but	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
cried	1
out	1
aloud,	1
“Let	1
no	1
one	1
take	1
him	1
from	1
me;	1
leave	1
me	1
hand	1
to	1
hand	1
with	1
this	1
demon,	1
this	1
wizard,	1
this	1
enchanter;	1
I	1
will	1
teach	1
him,	1
I	1
myself,	1
who	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
of	1
La	1
Mancha	1
is.”	1
The	1
cat,	1
however,	1
never	1
minding	1
these	1
threats,	1
snarled	1
and	1
held	1
on;	1
but	1
at	1
last	1
the	1
duke	1
pulled	1
it	1
off	1
and	1
flung	1
it	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
window.	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
was	1
left	1
with	1
a	1
face	1
as	1
full	1
of	1
holes	1
as	1
a	1
sieve	1
and	1
a	1
nose	1
not	1
in	1
very	1
good	1
condition,	1
and	1
greatly	1
vexed	1
that	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
let	1
him	1
finish	1
the	1
battle	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
so	1
stoutly	1
fighting	1
with	1
that	1
villain	1
of	1
an	1
enchanter.	1
They	1
sent	1
for	1
some	1
oil	1
of	1
John’s	1
wort,	1
and	1
Altisidora	1
herself	1
with	1
her	1
own	1
fair	1
hands	1
bandaged	1
all	1
the	1
wounded	1
parts;	1
and	1
as	1
she	1
did	1
so	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
him	1
in	1
a	1
low	1
voice.	1
“All	1
these	1
mishaps	1
have	1
befallen	1
thee,	1
hardhearted	1
knight,	1
for	1
the	1
sin	1
of	1
thy	1
insensibility	1
and	1
obstinacy;	1
and	1
God	1
grant	1
thy	1
squire	1
Sancho	1
may	1
forget	1
to	1
whip	1
himself,	1
so	1
that	1
that	1
dearly	1
beloved	1
Dulcinea	1
of	1
thine	1
may	1
never	1
be	1
released	1
from	1
her	1
enchantment,	1
that	1
thou	1
mayest	1
never	1
come	1
to	1
her	1
bed,	1
at	1
least	1
while	1
I	1
who	1
adore	1
thee	1
am	1
alive.”	1
To	1
all	1
this	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
made	1
no	1
answer	1
except	1
to	1
heave	1
deep	1
sighs,	1
and	1
then	1
stretched	1
himself	1
on	1
his	1
bed,	1
thanking	1
the	1
duke	1
and	1
duchess	1
for	1
their	1
kindness,	1
not	1
because	1
he	1
stood	1
in	1
any	1
fear	1
of	1
that	1
bell-ringing	1
rabble	1
of	1
enchanters	1
in	1
cat	1
shape,	1
but	1
because	1
he	1
recognised	1
their	1
good	1
intentions	1
in	1
coming	1
to	1
his	1
rescue.	1
The	1
duke	1
and	1
duchess	1
left	1
him	1
to	1
repose	1
and	1
withdrew	1
greatly	1
grieved	1
at	1
the	1
unfortunate	1
result	1
of	1
the	1
joke;	1
as	1
they	1
never	1
thought	1
the	1
adventure	1
would	1
have	1
fallen	1
so	1
heavy	1
on	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
or	1
cost	1
him	1
so	1
dear,	1
for	1
it	1
cost	1
him	1
five	1
days	1
of	1
confinement	1
to	1
his	1
bed,	1
during	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
another	1
adventure,	1
pleasanter	1
than	1
the	1
late	1
one,	1
which	1
his	1
chronicler	1
will	1
not	1
relate	1
just	1
now	1
in	1
order	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
turn	1
his	1
attention	1
to	1
Sancho	1
Panza,	1
who	1
was	1
proceeding	1
with	1
great	1
diligence	1
and	1
drollery	1
in	1
his	1
government.	1

The	1
history	1
says	1
that	1
from	1
the	1
justice	1
court	1
they	1
carried	1
Sancho	1
to	1
a	1
sumptuous	1
palace,	1
where	1
in	1
a	1
spacious	1
chamber	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
table	1
laid	1
out	1
with	1
royal	1
magnificence.	1
The	1
clarions	1
sounded	1
as	1
Sancho	1
entered	1
the	1
room,	1
and	1
four	1
pages	1
came	1
forward	1
to	1
present	1
him	1
with	1
water	1
for	1
his	1
hands,	1
which	1
Sancho	1
received	1
with	1
great	1
dignity.	1
The	1
music	1
ceased,	1
and	1
Sancho	1
seated	1
himself	1
at	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
table,	1
for	1
there	1
was	1
only	1
that	1
seat	1
placed,	1
and	1
no	1
more	1
than	1
one	1
cover	1
laid.	1
A	1
personage,	1
who	1
it	1
appeared	1
afterwards	1
was	1
a	1
physician,	1
placed	1
himself	1
standing	1
by	1
his	1
side	1
with	1
a	1
whalebone	1
wand	1
in	1
his	1
hand.	1
They	1
then	1
lifted	1
up	1
a	1
fine	1
white	1
cloth	1
covering	1
fruit	1
and	1
a	1
great	1
variety	1
of	1
dishes	1
of	1
different	1
sorts;	1
one	1
who	1
looked	1
like	1
a	1
student	1
said	1
grace,	1
and	1
a	1
page	1
put	1
a	1
laced	1
bib	1
on	1
Sancho,	1
while	1
another	1
who	1
played	1
the	1
part	1
of	1
head	1
carver	1
placed	1
a	1
dish	1
of	1
fruit	1
before	1
him.	1
But	1
hardly	1
had	1
he	1
tasted	1
a	1
morsel	1
when	1
the	1
man	1
with	1
the	1
wand	1
touched	1
the	1
plate	1
with	1
it,	1
and	1
they	1
took	1
it	1
away	1
from	1
before	1
him	1
with	1
the	1
utmost	1
celerity.	1
The	1
carver,	1
however,	1
brought	1
him	1
another	1
dish,	1
and	1
Sancho	1
proceeded	1
to	1
try	1
it;	1
but	1
before	1
he	1
could	1
get	1
at	1
it,	1
not	1
to	1
say	1
taste	1
it,	1
already	1
the	1
wand	1
had	1
touched	1
it	1
and	1
a	1
page	1
had	1
carried	1
it	1
off	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
promptitude	1
as	1
the	1
fruit.	1
Sancho	1
seeing	1
this	1
was	1
puzzled,	1
and	1
looking	1
from	1
one	1
to	1
another	1
asked	1
if	1
this	1
dinner	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
eaten	1
after	1
the	1
fashion	1
of	1
a	1
jugglery	1
trick.	1
To	1
this	1
he	1
with	1
the	1
wand	1
replied,	1
“It	1
is	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
eaten,	1
señor	1
governor,	1
except	1
as	1
is	1
usual	1
and	1
customary	1
in	1
other	1
islands	1
where	1
there	1
are	1
governors.	1
I,	1
señor,	1
am	1
a	1
physician,	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
paid	1
a	1
salary	1
in	1
this	1
island	1
to	1
serve	1
its	1
governors	1
as	1
such,	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
a	1
much	1
greater	1
regard	1
for	1
their	1
health	1
than	1
for	1
my	1
own,	1
studying	1
day	1
and	1
night	1
and	1
making	1
myself	1
acquainted	1
with	1
the	1
governor’s	1
constitution,	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
cure	1
him	1
when	1
he	1
falls	1
sick.	1
The	1
chief	1
thing	1
I	1
have	1
to	1
do	1
is	1
to	1
attend	1
at	1
his	1
dinners	1
and	1
suppers	1
and	1
allow	1
him	1
to	1
eat	1
what	1
appears	1
to	1
me	1
to	1
be	1
fit	1
for	1
him,	1
and	1
keep	1
from	1
him	1
what	1
I	1
think	1
will	1
do	1
him	1
harm	1
and	1
be	1
injurious	1
to	1
his	1
stomach;	1
and	1
therefore	1
I	1
ordered	1
that	1
plate	1
of	1
fruit	1
to	1
be	1
removed	1
as	1
being	1
too	1
moist,	1
and	1
that	1
other	1
dish	1
I	1
ordered	1
to	1
be	1
removed	1
as	1
being	1
too	1
hot	1
and	1
containing	1
many	1
spices	1
that	1
stimulate	1
thirst;	1
for	1
he	1
who	1
drinks	1
much	1
kills	1
and	1
consumes	1
the	1
radical	1
moisture	1
wherein	1
life	1
consists.”	1
“Well	1
then,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“that	1
dish	1
of	1
roast	1
partridges	1
there	1
that	1
seems	1
so	1
savoury	1
will	1
not	1
do	1
me	1
any	1
harm.”	1
To	1
this	1
the	1
physician	1
replied,	1
“Of	1
those	1
my	1
lord	1
the	1
governor	1
shall	1
not	1
eat	1
so	1
long	1
as	1
I	1
live.”	1
“Why	1
so?”	1
said	1
Sancho.	1
“Because,”	1
replied	1
the	1
doctor,	1
“our	1
master	1
Hippocrates,	1
the	1
polestar	1
and	1
beacon	1
of	1
medicine,	1
says	1
in	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
aphorisms	1
_omnis	1
saturatio	1
mala,	1
perdicis	1
autem	1
pessima_,	1
which	1
means	1
‘all	1
repletion	1
is	1
bad,	1
but	1
that	1
of	1
partridge	1
is	1
the	1
worst	1
of	1
all.”	1
“In	1
that	1
case,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“let	1
señor	1
doctor	1
see	1
among	1
the	1
dishes	1
that	1
are	1
on	1
the	1
table	1
what	1
will	1
do	1
me	1
most	1
good	1
and	1
least	1
harm,	1
and	1
let	1
me	1
eat	1
it,	1
without	1
tapping	1
it	1
with	1
his	1
stick;	1
for	1
by	1
the	1
life	1
of	1
the	1
governor,	1
and	1
so	1
may	1
God	1
suffer	1
me	1
to	1
enjoy	1
it,	1
but	1
I’m	1
dying	1
of	1
hunger;	1
and	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
the	1
doctor	1
and	1
all	1
he	1
may	1
say,	1
to	1
deny	1
me	1
food	1
is	1
the	1
way	1
to	1
take	1
my	1
life	1
instead	1
of	1
prolonging	1
it.”	1
“Your	1
worship	1
is	1
right,	1
señor	1
governor,”	1
said	1
the	1
physician;	1
“and	1
therefore	1
your	1
worship,	1
I	1
consider,	1
should	1
not	1
eat	1
of	1
those	1
stewed	1
rabbits	1
there,	1
because	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
furry	1
kind	1
of	1
food;	1
if	1
that	1
veal	1
were	1
not	1
roasted	1
and	1
served	1
with	1
pickles,	1
you	1
might	1
try	1
it;	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
question.”	1
“That	1
big	1
dish	1
that	1
is	1
smoking	1
farther	1
off,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“seems	1
to	1
me	1
to	1
be	1
an	1
olla	1
podrida,	1
and	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
diversity	1
of	1
things	1
in	1
such	1
ollas,	1
I	1
can’t	1
fail	1
to	1
light	1
upon	1
something	1
tasty	1
and	1
good	1
for	1
me.”	1

“_Absit_,”	1
said	1
the	1
doctor;	1
“far	1
from	1
us	1
be	1
any	1
such	1
base	1
thought!	1
There	1
is	1
nothing	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
less	1
nourishing	1
than	1
an	1
olla	1
podrida;	1
to	1
canons,	1
or	1
rectors	1
of	1
colleges,	1
or	1
peasants’	1
weddings	1
with	1
your	1
ollas	1
podridas,	1
but	1
let	1
us	1
have	1
none	1
of	1
them	1
on	1
the	1
tables	1
of	1
governors,	1
where	1
everything	1
that	1
is	1
present	1
should	1
be	1
delicate	1
and	1
refined;	1
and	1
the	1
reason	1
is,	1
that	1
always,	1
everywhere	1
and	1
by	1
everybody,	1
simple	1
medicines	1
are	1
more	1
esteemed	1
than	1
compound	1
ones,	1
for	1
we	1
cannot	1
go	1
wrong	1
in	1
those	1
that	1
are	1
simple,	1
while	1
in	1
the	1
compound	1
we	1
may,	1
by	1
merely	1
altering	1
the	1
quantity	1
of	1
the	1
things	1
composing	1
them.	1
But	1
what	1
I	1
am	1
of	1
opinion	1
the	1
governor	1
should	1
eat	1
now	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
preserve	1
and	1
fortify	1
his	1
health	1
is	1
a	1
hundred	1
or	1
so	1
of	1
wafer	1
cakes	1
and	1
a	1
few	1
thin	1
slices	1
of	1
conserve	1
of	1
quinces,	1
which	1
will	1
settle	1
his	1
stomach	1
and	1
help	1
his	1
digestion.”	1
Sancho	1
on	1
hearing	1
this	1
threw	1
himself	1
back	1
in	1
his	1
chair	1
and	1
surveyed	1
the	1
doctor	1
steadily,	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
solemn	1
tone	1
asked	1
him	1
what	1
his	1
name	1
was	1
and	1
where	1
he	1
had	1
studied.	1
He	1
replied,	1
“My	1
name,	1
señor	1
governor,	1
is	1
Doctor	1
Pedro	1
Recio	1
de	1
Aguero	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
native	1
of	1
a	1
place	1
called	1
Tirteafuera	1
which	1
lies	1
between	1
Caracuel	1
and	1
Almodóvar	1
del	1
Campo,	1
on	1
the	1
right-hand	1
side,	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
the	1
degree	1
of	1
doctor	1
from	1
the	1
university	1
of	1
Osuna.”	1
To	1
which	1
Sancho,	1
glowing	1
all	1
over	1
with	1
rage,	1
returned,	1
“Then	1
let	1
Doctor	1
Pedro	1
Recio	1
de	1
Malaguero,	1
native	1
of	1
Tirteafuera,	1
a	1
place	1
that’s	1
on	1
the	1
right-hand	1
side	1
as	1
we	1
go	1
from	1
Caracuel	1
to	1
Almodóvar	1
del	1
Campo,	1
graduate	1
of	1
Osuna,	1
get	1
out	1
of	1
my	1
presence	1
at	1
once;	1
or	1
I	1
swear	1
by	1
the	1
sun	1
I’ll	1
take	1
a	1
cudgel,	1
and	1
by	1
dint	1
of	1
blows,	1
beginning	1
with	1
him,	1
I’ll	1
not	1
leave	1
a	1
doctor	1
in	1
the	1
whole	1
island;	1
at	1
least	1
of	1
those	1
I	1
know	1
to	1
be	1
ignorant;	1
for	1
as	1
to	1
learned,	1
wise,	1
sensible	1
physicians,	1
them	1
I	1
will	1
reverence	1
and	1
honour	1
as	1
divine	1
persons.	1
Once	1
more	1
I	1
say	1
let	1
Pedro	1
Recio	1
get	1
out	1
of	1
this	1
or	1
I’ll	1
take	1
this	1
chair	1
I	1
am	1
sitting	1
on	1
and	1
break	1
it	1
over	1
his	1
head.	1
And	1
if	1
they	1
call	1
me	1
to	1
account	1
for	1
it,	1
I’ll	1
clear	1
myself	1
by	1
saying	1
I	1
served	1
God	1
in	1
killing	1
a	1
bad	1
doctor—a	1
general	1
executioner.	1
And	1
now	1
give	1
me	1
something	1
to	1
eat,	1
or	1
else	1
take	1
your	1
government;	1
for	1
a	1
trade	1
that	1
does	1
not	1
feed	1
its	1
master	1
is	1
not	1
worth	1
two	1
beans.”	1
The	1
doctor	1
was	1
dismayed	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
the	1
governor	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
passion,	1
and	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
made	1
a	1
Tirteafuera	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
but	1
that	1
the	1
same	1
instant	1
a	1
post-horn	1
sounded	1
in	1
the	1
street;	1
and	1
the	1
carver	1
putting	1
his	1
head	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
window	1
turned	1
round	1
and	1
said,	1
“It’s	1
a	1
courier	1
from	1
my	1
lord	1
the	1
duke,	1
no	1
doubt	1
with	1
some	1
despatch	1
of	1
importance.”	1
The	1
courier	1
came	1
in	1
all	1
sweating	1
and	1
flurried,	1
and	1
taking	1
a	1
paper	1
from	1
his	1
bosom,	1
placed	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
governor’s	1
hands.	1
Sancho	1
handed	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
majordomo	1
and	1
bade	1
him	1
read	1
the	1
superscription,	1
which	1
ran	1
thus:	1
_To	1
Don	1
Sancho	1
Panza,	1
Governor	1
of	1
the	1
Island	1
of	1
Barataria,	1
into	1
his	1
own	1
hands	1
or	1
those	1
of	1
his	1
secretary._	1
Sancho	1
when	1
he	1
heard	1
this	1
said,	1
“Which	1
of	1
you	1
is	1
my	1
secretary?”	1
“I	1
am,	1
señor,”	1
said	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
present,	1
“for	1
I	1
can	1
read	1
and	1
write,	1
and	1
am	1
a	1
Biscayan.”	1
“With	1
that	1
addition,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“you	1
might	1
be	1
secretary	1
to	1
the	1
emperor	1
himself;	1
open	1
this	1
paper	1
and	1
see	1
what	1
it	1
says.”	1
The	1
new-born	1
secretary	1
obeyed,	1
and	1
having	1
read	1
the	1
contents	1
said	1
the	1
matter	1
was	1
one	1
to	1
be	1
discussed	1
in	1
private.	1
Sancho	1
ordered	1
the	1
chamber	1
to	1
be	1
cleared,	1
the	1
majordomo	1
and	1
the	1
carver	1
only	1
remaining;	1
so	1
the	1
doctor	1
and	1
the	1
others	1
withdrew,	1
and	1
then	1
the	1
secretary	1
read	1
the	1
letter,	1
which	1
was	1
as	1
follows:	1
It	1
has	1
come	1
to	1
my	1
knowledge,	1
Señor	1
Don	1
Sancho	1
Panza,	1
that	1
certain	1
enemies	1
of	1
mine	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
island	1
are	1
about	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
furious	1
attack	1
upon	1
it	1
some	1
night,	1
I	1
know	1
not	1
when.	1
It	1
behoves	1
you	1
to	1
be	1
on	1
the	1
alert	1
and	1
keep	1
watch,	1
that	1
they	1
surprise	1
you	1
not.	1
I	1
also	1
know	1
by	1
trustworthy	1
spies	1
that	1
four	1
persons	1
have	1
entered	1
the	1
town	1
in	1
disguise	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
take	1
your	1
life,	1
because	1
they	1
stand	1
in	1
dread	1
of	1
your	1
great	1
capacity;	1
keep	1
your	1
eyes	1
open	1
and	1
take	1
heed	1
who	1
approaches	1
you	1
to	1
address	1
you,	1
and	1
eat	1
nothing	1
that	1
is	1
presented	1
to	1
you.	1
I	1
will	1
take	1
care	1
to	1
send	1
you	1
aid	1
if	1
you	1
find	1
yourself	1
in	1
difficulty,	1
but	1
in	1
all	1
things	1
you	1
will	1
act	1
as	1
may	1
be	1
expected	1
of	1
your	1
judgment.	1
From	1
this	1
place,	1
the	1
Sixteenth	1
of	1
August,	1
at	1
four	1
in	1
the	1
morning.	1
Your	1
friend,	1
THE	1
DUKE	1
Sancho	1
was	1
astonished,	1
and	1
those	1
who	1
stood	1
by	1
made	1
believe	1
to	1
be	1
so	1
too,	1
and	1
turning	1
to	1
the	1
majordomo	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
him,	1
“What	1
we	1
have	1
got	1
to	1
do	1
first,	1
and	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
done	1
at	1
once,	1
is	1
to	1
put	1
Doctor	1
Recio	1
in	1
the	1
lock-up;	1
for	1
if	1
anyone	1
wants	1
to	1
kill	1
me	1
it	1
is	1
he,	1
and	1
by	1
a	1
slow	1
death	1
and	1
the	1
worst	1
of	1
all,	1
which	1
is	1
hunger.”	1
“Likewise,”	1
said	1
the	1
carver,	1
“it	1
is	1
my	1
opinion	1
your	1
worship	1
should	1
not	1
eat	1
anything	1
that	1
is	1
on	1
this	1
table,	1
for	1
the	1
whole	1
was	1
a	1
present	1
from	1
some	1
nuns;	1
and	1
as	1
they	1
say,	1
‘behind	1
the	1
cross	1
there’s	1
the	1
devil.’”	1
“I	1
don’t	1
deny	1
it,”	1
said	1
Sancho;	1
“so	1
for	1
the	1
present	1
give	1
me	1
a	1
piece	1
of	1
bread	1
and	1
four	1
pounds	1
or	1
so	1
of	1
grapes;	1
no	1
poison	1
can	1
come	1
in	1
them;	1
for	1
the	1
fact	1
is	1
I	1
can’t	1
go	1
on	1
without	1
eating;	1
and	1
if	1
we	1
are	1
to	1
be	1
prepared	1
for	1
these	1
battles	1
that	1
are	1
threatening	1
us	1
we	1
must	1
be	1
well	1
provisioned;	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
tripes	1
that	1
carry	1
the	1
heart	1
and	1
not	1
the	1
heart	1
the	1
tripes.	1
And	1
you,	1
secretary,	1
answer	1
my	1
lord	1
the	1
duke	1
and	1
tell	1
him	1
that	1
all	1
his	1
commands	1
shall	1
be	1
obeyed	1
to	1
the	1
letter,	1
as	1
he	1
directs;	1
and	1
say	1
from	1
me	1
to	1
my	1
lady	1
the	1
duchess	1
that	1
I	1
kiss	1
her	1
hands,	1
and	1
that	1
I	1
beg	1
of	1
her	1
not	1
to	1
forget	1
to	1
send	1
my	1
letter	1
and	1
bundle	1
to	1
my	1
wife	1
Teresa	1
Panza	1
by	1
a	1
messenger;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
take	1
it	1
as	1
a	1
great	1
favour	1
and	1
will	1
not	1
fail	1
to	1
serve	1
her	1
in	1
all	1
that	1
may	1
lie	1
within	1
my	1
power;	1
and	1
as	1
you	1
are	1
about	1
it	1
you	1
may	1
enclose	1
a	1
kiss	1
of	1
the	1
hand	1
to	1
my	1
master	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
see	1
I	1
am	1
grateful	1
bread;	1
and	1
as	1
a	1
good	1
secretary	1
and	1
a	1
good	1
Biscayan	1
you	1
may	1
add	1
whatever	1
you	1
like	1
and	1
whatever	1
will	1
come	1
in	1
best;	1
and	1
now	1
take	1
away	1
this	1
cloth	1
and	1
give	1
me	1
something	1
to	1
eat,	1
and	1
I’ll	1
be	1
ready	1
to	1
meet	1
all	1
the	1
spies	1
and	1
assassins	1
and	1
enchanters	1
that	1
may	1
come	1
against	1
me	1
or	1
my	1
island.”	1
At	1
this	1
instant	1
a	1
page	1
entered	1
saying,	1
“Here	1
is	1
a	1
farmer	1
on	1
business,	1
who	1
wants	1
to	1
speak	1
to	1
your	1
lordship	1
on	1
a	1
matter	1
of	1
great	1
importance,	1
he	1
says.”	1
“It’s	1
very	1
odd,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“the	1
ways	1
of	1
these	1
men	1
on	1
business;	1
is	1
it	1
possible	1
they	1
can	1
be	1
such	1
fools	1
as	1
not	1
to	1
see	1
that	1
an	1
hour	1
like	1
this	1
is	1
no	1
hour	1
for	1
coming	1
on	1
business?	1
We	1
who	1
govern	1
and	1
we	1
who	1
are	1
judges—are	1
we	1
not	1
men	1
of	1
flesh	1
and	1
blood,	1
and	1
are	1
we	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
allowed	1
the	1
time	1
required	1
for	1
taking	1
rest,	1
unless	1
they’d	1
have	1
us	1
made	1
of	1
marble?	1
By	1
God	1
and	1
on	1
my	1
conscience,	1
if	1
the	1
government	1
remains	1
in	1
my	1
hands	1
(which	1
I	1
have	1
a	1
notion	1
it	1
won’t),	1
I’ll	1
bring	1
more	1
than	1
one	1
man	1
on	1
business	1
to	1
order.	1
However,	1
tell	1
this	1
good	1
man	1
to	1
come	1
in;	1
but	1
take	1
care	1
first	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
not	1
some	1
spy	1
or	1
one	1
of	1
my	1
assassins.”	1
“No,	1
my	1
lord,”	1
said	1
the	1
page,	1
“for	1
he	1
looks	1
like	1
a	1
simple	1
fellow,	1
and	1
either	1
I	1
know	1
very	1
little	1
or	1
he	1
is	1
as	1
good	1
as	1
good	1
bread.”	1
“There	1
is	1
nothing	1
to	1
be	1
afraid	1
of,”	1
said	1
the	1
majordomo,	1
“for	1
we	1
are	1
all	1
here.”	1
“Would	1
it	1
be	1
possible,	1
carver,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“now	1
that	1
Doctor	1
Pedro	1
Recio	1
is	1
not	1
here,	1
to	1
let	1
me	1
eat	1
something	1
solid	1
and	1
substantial,	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
even	1
a	1
piece	1
of	1
bread	1
and	1
an	1
onion?”	1
“To-night	1
at	1
supper,”	1
said	1
the	1
carver,	1
“the	1
shortcomings	1
of	1
the	1
dinner	1
shall	1
be	1
made	1
good,	1
and	1
your	1
lordship	1
shall	1
be	1
fully	1
contented.”	1
“God	1
grant	1
it,”	1
said	1
Sancho.	1
The	1
farmer	1
now	1
came	1
in,	1
a	1
well-favoured	1
man	1
that	1
one	1
might	1
see	1
a	1
thousand	1
leagues	1
off	1
was	1
an	1
honest	1
fellow	1
and	1
a	1
good	1
soul.	1
The	1
first	1
thing	1
he	1
said	1
was,	1
“Which	1
is	1
the	1
lord	1
governor	1
here?”	1
“Which	1
should	1
it	1
be,”	1
said	1
the	1
secretary,	1
“but	1
he	1
who	1
is	1
seated	1
in	1
the	1
chair?”	1
“Then	1
I	1
humble	1
myself	1
before	1
him,”	1
said	1
the	1
farmer;	1
and	1
going	1
on	1
his	1
knees	1
he	1
asked	1
for	1
his	1
hand,	1
to	1
kiss	1
it.	1
Sancho	1
refused	1
it,	1
and	1
bade	1
him	1
stand	1
up	1
and	1
say	1
what	1
he	1
wanted.	1
The	1
farmer	1
obeyed,	1
and	1
then	1
said,	1
“I	1
am	1
a	1
farmer,	1
señor,	1
a	1
native	1
of	1
Miguelturra,	1
a	1
village	1
two	1
leagues	1
from	1
Ciudad	1
Real.”	1
“Another	1
Tirteafuera!”	1
said	1
Sancho;	1
“say	1
on,	1
brother;	1
I	1
know	1
Miguelturra	1
very	1
well	1
I	1
can	1
tell	1
you,	1
for	1
it’s	1
not	1
very	1
far	1
from	1
my	1
own	1
town.”	1
“The	1
case	1
is	1
this,	1
señor,”	1
continued	1
the	1
farmer,	1
“that	1
by	1
God’s	1
mercy	1
I	1
am	1
married	1
with	1
the	1
leave	1
and	1
licence	1
of	1
the	1
holy	1
Roman	1
Catholic	1
Church;	1
I	1
have	1
two	1
sons,	1
students,	1
and	1
the	1
younger	1
is	1
studying	1
to	1
become	1
bachelor,	1
and	1
the	1
elder	1
to	1
be	1
licentiate;	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
widower,	1
for	1
my	1
wife	1
died,	1
or	1
more	1
properly	1
speaking,	1
a	1
bad	1
doctor	1
killed	1
her	1
on	1
my	1
hands,	1
giving	1
her	1
a	1
purge	1
when	1
she	1
was	1
with	1
child;	1
and	1
if	1
it	1
had	1
pleased	1
God	1
that	1
the	1
child	1
had	1
been	1
born,	1
and	1
was	1
a	1
boy,	1
I	1
would	1
have	1
put	1
him	1
to	1
study	1
for	1
doctor,	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
not	1
envy	1
his	1
brothers	1
the	1
bachelor	1
and	1
the	1
licentiate.”	1
“So	1
that	1
if	1
your	1
wife	1
had	1
not	1
died,	1
or	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
killed,	1
you	1
would	1
not	1
now	1
be	1
a	1
widower,”	1
said	1
Sancho.	1
“No,	1
señor,	1
certainly	1
not,”	1
said	1
the	1
farmer.	1
“We’ve	1
got	1
that	1
much	1
settled,”	1
said	1
Sancho;	1
“get	1
on,	1
brother,	1
for	1
it’s	1
more	1
bed-time	1
than	1
business-time.”	1
“Well	1
then,”	1
said	1
the	1
farmer,	1
“this	1
son	1
of	1
mine	1
who	1
is	1
going	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
bachelor,	1
fell	1
in	1
love	1
in	1
the	1
said	1
town	1
with	1
a	1
damsel	1
called	1
Clara	1
Perlerina,	1
daughter	1
of	1
Andres	1
Perlerino,	1
a	1
very	1
rich	1
farmer;	1
and	1
this	1
name	1
of	1
Perlerines	1
does	1
not	1
come	1
to	1
them	1
by	1
ancestry	1
or	1
descent,	1
but	1
because	1
all	1
the	1
family	1
are	1
paralytics,	1
and	1
for	1
a	1
better	1
name	1
they	1
call	1
them	1
Perlerines;	1
though	1
to	1
tell	1
the	1
truth	1
the	1
damsel	1
is	1
as	1
fair	1
as	1
an	1
Oriental	1
pearl,	1
and	1
like	1
a	1
flower	1
of	1
the	1
field,	1
if	1
you	1
look	1
at	1
her	1
on	1
the	1
right	1
side;	1
on	1
the	1
left	1
not	1
so	1
much,	1
for	1
on	1
that	1
side	1
she	1
wants	1
an	1
eye	1
that	1
she	1
lost	1
by	1
small-pox;	1
and	1
though	1
her	1
face	1
is	1
thickly	1
and	1
deeply	1
pitted,	1
those	1
who	1
love	1
her	1
say	1
they	1
are	1
not	1
pits	1
that	1
are	1
there,	1
but	1
the	1
graves	1
where	1
the	1
hearts	1
of	1
her	1
lovers	1
are	1
buried.	1
She	1
is	1
so	1
cleanly	1
that	1
not	1
to	1
soil	1
her	1
face	1
she	1
carries	1
her	1
nose	1
turned	1
up,	1
as	1
they	1
say,	1
so	1
that	1
one	1
would	1
fancy	1
it	1
was	1
running	1
away	1
from	1
her	1
mouth;	1
and	1
with	1
all	1
this	1
she	1
looks	1
extremely	1
well,	1
for	1
she	1
has	1
a	1
wide	1
mouth;	1
and	1
but	1
for	1
wanting	1
ten	1
or	1
a	1
dozen	1
teeth	1
and	1
grinders	1
she	1
might	1
compare	1
and	1
compete	1
with	1
the	1
comeliest.	1
Of	1
her	1
lips	1
I	1
say	1
nothing,	1
for	1
they	1
are	1
so	1
fine	1
and	1
thin	1
that,	1
if	1
lips	1
might	1
be	1
reeled,	1
one	1
might	1
make	1
a	1
skein	1
of	1
them;	1
but	1
being	1
of	1
a	1
different	1
colour	1
from	1
ordinary	1
lips	1
they	1
are	1
wonderful,	1
for	1
they	1
are	1
mottled,	1
blue,	1
green,	1
and	1
purple—let	1
my	1
lord	1
the	1
governor	1
pardon	1
me	1
for	1
painting	1
so	1
minutely	1
the	1
charms	1
of	1
her	1
who	1
some	1
time	1
or	1
other	1
will	1
be	1
my	1
daughter;	1
for	1
I	1
love	1
her,	1
and	1
I	1
don’t	1
find	1
her	1
amiss.”	1
“Paint	1
what	1
you	1
will,”	1
said	1
Sancho;	1
“I	1
enjoy	1
your	1
painting,	1
and	1
if	1
I	1
had	1
dined	1
there	1
could	1
be	1
no	1
dessert	1
more	1
to	1
my	1
taste	1
than	1
your	1
portrait.”	1
“That	1
I	1
have	1
still	1
to	1
furnish,”	1
said	1
the	1
farmer;	1
“but	1
a	1
time	1
will	1
come	1
when	1
we	1
may	1
be	1
able	1
if	1
we	1
are	1
not	1
now;	1
and	1
I	1
can	1
tell	1
you,	1
señor,	1
if	1
I	1
could	1
paint	1
her	1
gracefulness	1
and	1
her	1
tall	1
figure,	1
it	1
would	1
astonish	1
you;	1
but	1
that	1
is	1
impossible	1
because	1
she	1
is	1
bent	1
double	1
with	1
her	1
knees	1
up	1
to	1
her	1
mouth;	1
but	1
for	1
all	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
easy	1
to	1
see	1
that	1
if	1
she	1
could	1
stand	1
up	1
she’d	1
knock	1
her	1
head	1
against	1
the	1
ceiling;	1
and	1
she	1
would	1
have	1
given	1
her	1
hand	1
to	1
my	1
bachelor	1
ere	1
this,	1
only	1
that	1
she	1
can’t	1
stretch	1
it	1
out,	1
for	1
it’s	1
contracted;	1
but	1
still	1
one	1
can	1
see	1
its	1
elegance	1
and	1
fine	1
make	1
by	1
its	1
long	1
furrowed	1
nails.”	1
“That	1
will	1
do,	1
brother,”	1
said	1
Sancho;	1
“consider	1
you	1
have	1
painted	1
her	1
from	1
head	1
to	1
foot;	1
what	1
is	1
it	1
you	1
want	1
now?	1
Come	1
to	1
the	1
point	1
without	1
all	1
this	1
beating	1
about	1
the	1
bush,	1
and	1
all	1
these	1
scraps	1
and	1
additions.”	1
“I	1
want	1
your	1
worship,	1
señor,”	1
said	1
the	1
farmer,	1
“to	1
do	1
me	1
the	1
favour	1
of	1
giving	1
me	1
a	1
letter	1
of	1
recommendation	1
to	1
the	1
girl’s	1
father,	1
begging	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
so	1
good	1
as	1
to	1
let	1
this	1
marriage	1
take	1
place,	1
as	1
we	1
are	1
not	1
ill-matched	1
either	1
in	1
the	1
gifts	1
of	1
fortune	1
or	1
of	1
nature;	1
for	1
to	1
tell	1
the	1
truth,	1
señor	1
governor,	1
my	1
son	1
is	1
possessed	1
of	1
a	1
devil,	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
day	1
but	1
the	1
evil	1
spirits	1
torment	1
him	1
three	1
or	1
four	1
times;	1
and	1
from	1
having	1
once	1
fallen	1
into	1
the	1
fire,	1
he	1
has	1
his	1
face	1
puckered	1
up	1
like	1
a	1
piece	1
of	1
parchment,	1
and	1
his	1
eyes	1
watery	1
and	1
always	1
running;	1
but	1
he	1
has	1
the	1
disposition	1
of	1
an	1
angel,	1
and	1
if	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
for	1
belabouring	1
and	1
pummelling	1
himself	1
he’d	1
be	1
a	1
saint.”	1
“Is	1
there	1
anything	1
else	1
you	1
want,	1
good	1
man?”	1
said	1
Sancho.	1
“There’s	1
another	1
thing	1
I’d	1
like,”	1
said	1
the	1
farmer,	1
“but	1
I’m	1
afraid	1
to	1
mention	1
it;	1
however,	1
out	1
it	1
must;	1
for	1
after	1
all	1
I	1
can’t	1
let	1
it	1
be	1
rotting	1
in	1
my	1
breast,	1
come	1
what	1
may.	1
I	1
mean,	1
señor,	1
that	1
I’d	1
like	1
your	1
worship	1
to	1
give	1
me	1
three	1
hundred	1
or	1
six	1
hundred	1
ducats	1
as	1
a	1
help	1
to	1
my	1
bachelor’s	1
portion,	1
to	1
help	1
him	1
in	1
setting	1
up	1
house;	1
for	1
they	1
must,	1
in	1
short,	1
live	1
by	1
themselves,	1
without	1
being	1
subject	1
to	1
the	1
interferences	1
of	1
their	1
fathers-in-law.”	1
“Just	1
see	1
if	1
there’s	1
anything	1
else	1
you’d	1
like,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“and	1
don’t	1
hold	1
back	1
from	1
mentioning	1
it	1
out	1
of	1
bashfulness	1
or	1
modesty.”	1
“No,	1
indeed	1
there	1
is	1
not,”	1
said	1
the	1
farmer.	1
The	1
moment	1
he	1
said	1
this	1
the	1
governor	1
started	1
to	1
his	1
feet,	1
and	1
seizing	1
the	1
chair	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
sitting	1
on	1
exclaimed,	1
“By	1
all	1
that’s	1
good,	1
you	1
ill-bred,	1
boorish	1
Don	1
Bumpkin,	1
if	1
you	1
don’t	1
get	1
out	1
of	1
this	1
at	1
once	1
and	1
hide	1
yourself	1
from	1
my	1
sight,	1
I’ll	1
lay	1
your	1
head	1
open	1
with	1
this	1
chair.	1
You	1
whoreson	1
rascal,	1
you	1
devil’s	1
own	1
painter,	1
and	1
is	1
it	1
at	1
this	1
hour	1
you	1
come	1
to	1
ask	1
me	1
for	1
six	1
hundred	1
ducats!	1
How	1
should	1
I	1
have	1
them,	1
you	1
stinking	1
brute?	1
And	1
why	1
should	1
I	1
give	1
them	1
to	1
you	1
if	1
I	1
had	1
them,	1
you	1
knave	1
and	1
blockhead?	1
What	1
have	1
I	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
Miguelturra	1
or	1
the	1
whole	1
family	1
of	1
the	1
Perlerines?	1
Get	1
out	1
I	1
say,	1
or	1
by	1
the	1
life	1
of	1
my	1
lord	1
the	1
duke	1
I’ll	1
do	1
as	1
I	1
said.	1
You’re	1
not	1
from	1
Miguelturra,	1
but	1
some	1
knave	1
sent	1
here	1
from	1
hell	1
to	1
tempt	1
me.	1
Why,	1
you	1
villain,	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
yet	1
had	1
the	1
government	1
half	1
a	1
day,	1
and	1
you	1
want	1
me	1
to	1
have	1
six	1
hundred	1
ducats	1
already!”	1
The	1
carver	1
made	1
signs	1
to	1
the	1
farmer	1
to	1
leave	1
the	1
room,	1
which	1
he	1
did	1
with	1
his	1
head	1
down,	1
and	1
to	1
all	1
appearance	1
in	1
terror	1
lest	1
the	1
governor	1
should	1
carry	1
his	1
threats	1
into	1
effect,	1
for	1
the	1
rogue	1
knew	1
very	1
well	1
how	1
to	1
play	1
his	1
part.	1
But	1
let	1
us	1
leave	1
Sancho	1
in	1
his	1
wrath,	1
and	1
peace	1
be	1
with	1
them	1
all;	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
return	1
to	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
whom	1
we	1
left	1
with	1
his	1
face	1
bandaged	1
and	1
doctored	1
after	1
the	1
cat	1
wounds,	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
cured	1
for	1
eight	1
days;	1
and	1
on	1
one	1
of	1
these	1
there	1
befell	1
him	1
what	1
Cide	1
Hamete	1
promises	1
to	1
relate	1
with	1
that	1
exactitude	1
and	1
truth	1
with	1
which	1
he	1
is	1
wont	1

with	1

Six	1
days	1
he	1
remained	1
without	1
appearing	1
in	1
public,	1
and	1
one	1
night	1
as	1
he	1
lay	1
awake	1
thinking	1
of	1
his	1
misfortunes	1
and	1
of	1
Altisidora’s	1
pursuit	1
of	1
him,	1
he	1
perceived	1
that	1
someone	1
was	1
opening	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
his	1
room	1
with	1
a	1
key,	1
and	1
he	1
at	1
once	1
made	1
up	1
his	1
mind	1
that	1
the	1
enamoured	1
damsel	1
was	1
coming	1
to	1
make	1
an	1
assault	1
upon	1
his	1
chastity	1
and	1
put	1
him	1
in	1
danger	1
of	1
failing	1
in	1
the	1
fidelity	1
he	1
owed	1
to	1
his	1
lady	1
Dulcinea	1
del	1
Toboso.	1
“No,”	1
said	1
he,	1
firmly	1
persuaded	1
of	1
the	1
truth	1
of	1
his	1
idea	1
(and	1
he	1
said	1
it	1
loud	1
enough	1
to	1
be	1
heard),	1
“the	1
greatest	1
beauty	1
upon	1
earth	1
shall	1
not	1
avail	1
to	1
make	1
me	1
renounce	1
my	1
adoration	1
of	1
her	1
whom	1
I	1
bear	1
stamped	1
and	1
graved	1
in	1
the	1
core	1
of	1
my	1
heart	1
and	1
the	1
secret	1
depths	1
of	1
my	1
bowels;	1
be	1
thou,	1
lady	1
mine,	1
transformed	1
into	1
a	1
clumsy	1
country	1
wench,	1
or	1
into	1
a	1
nymph	1
of	1
golden	1
Tagus	1
weaving	1
a	1
web	1
of	1
silk	1
and	1
gold,	1
let	1
Merlin	1
or	1
Montesinos	1
hold	1
thee	1
captive	1
where	1
they	1
will;	1
where’er	1
thou	1
art,	1
thou	1
art	1
mine,	1
and	1
where’er	1
I	1
am,	1
must	1
be	1
thine.”	1
The	1
very	1
instant	1
he	1
had	1
uttered	1
these	1
words,	1
the	1
door	1
opened.	1
He	1
stood	1
up	1
on	1
the	1
bed	1
wrapped	1
from	1
head	1
to	1
foot	1
in	1
a	1
yellow	1
satin	1
coverlet,	1
with	1
a	1
cap	1
on	1
his	1
head,	1
and	1
his	1
face	1
and	1
his	1
moustaches	1
tied	1
up,	1
his	1
face	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
scratches,	1
and	1
his	1
moustaches	1
to	1
keep	1
them	1
from	1
drooping	1
and	1
falling	1
down,	1
in	1
which	1
trim	1
he	1
looked	1
the	1
most	1
extraordinary	1
scarecrow	1
that	1
could	1
be	1
conceived.	1
He	1
kept	1
his	1
eyes	1
fixed	1
on	1
the	1
door,	1
and	1
just	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
expecting	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
love-smitten	1
and	1
unhappy	1
Altisidora	1
make	1
her	1
appearance,	1
he	1
saw	1
coming	1
in	1
a	1
most	1
venerable	1
duenna,	1
in	1
a	1
long	1
white-bordered	1
veil	1
that	1
covered	1
and	1
enveloped	1
her	1
from	1
head	1
to	1
foot.	1
Between	1
the	1
fingers	1
of	1
her	1
left	1
hand	1
she	1
held	1
a	1
short	1
lighted	1
candle,	1
while	1
with	1
her	1
right	1
she	1
shaded	1
it	1
to	1
keep	1
the	1
light	1
from	1
her	1
eyes,	1
which	1
were	1
covered	1
by	1
spectacles	1
of	1
great	1
size,	1
and	1
she	1
advanced	1
with	1
noiseless	1
steps,	1
treading	1
very	1
softly.	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
kept	1
an	1
eye	1
upon	1
her	1
from	1
his	1
watchtower,	1
and	1
observing	1
her	1
costume	1
and	1
noting	1
her	1
silence,	1
he	1
concluded	1
that	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
some	1
witch	1
or	1
sorceress	1
that	1
was	1
coming	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
guise	1
to	1
work	1
him	1
some	1
mischief,	1
and	1
he	1
began	1
crossing	1
himself	1
at	1
a	1
great	1
rate.	1
The	1
spectre	1
still	1
advanced,	1
and	1
on	1
reaching	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
room,	1
looked	1
up	1
and	1
saw	1
the	1
energy	1
with	1
which	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
was	1
crossing	1
himself;	1
and	1
if	1
he	1
was	1
scared	1
by	1
seeing	1
such	1
a	1
figure	1
as	1
hers,	1
she	1
was	1
terrified	1
at	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
his;	1
for	1
the	1
moment	1
she	1
saw	1
his	1
tall	1
yellow	1
form	1
with	1
the	1
coverlet	1
and	1
the	1
bandages	1
that	1
disfigured	1
him,	1
she	1
gave	1
a	1
loud	1
scream,	1
and	1
exclaiming,	1
“Jesus!	1
what’s	1
this	1
I	1
see?”	1
let	1
fall	1
the	1
candle	1
in	1
her	1
fright,	1
and	1
then	1
finding	1
herself	1
in	1
the	1
dark,	1
turned	1
about	1
to	1
make	1
off,	1
but	1
stumbling	1
on	1
her	1
skirts	1
in	1
her	1
consternation,	1
she	1
measured	1
her	1
length	1
with	1
a	1
mighty	1
fall.	1

Don	1
Quixote	1
in	1
his	1
trepidation	1
began	1
saying,	1
“I	1
conjure	1
thee,	1
phantom,	1
or	1
whatever	1
thou	1
art,	1
tell	1
me	1
what	1
thou	1
art	1
and	1
what	1
thou	1
wouldst	1
with	1
me.	1
If	1
thou	1
art	1
a	1
soul	1
in	1
torment,	1
say	1
so,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
my	1
powers	1
can	1
do	1
I	1
will	1
do	1
for	1
thee;	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
Catholic	1
Christian	1
and	1
love	1
to	1
do	1
good	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
world,	1
and	1
to	1
this	1
end	1
I	1
have	1
embraced	1
the	1
order	1
of	1
knight-errantry	1
to	1
which	1
I	1
belong,	1
the	1
province	1
of	1
which	1
extends	1
to	1
doing	1
good	1
even	1
to	1
souls	1
in	1
purgatory.”	1
The	1
unfortunate	1
duenna	1
hearing	1
herself	1
thus	1
conjured,	1
by	1
her	1
own	1
fear	1
guessed	1
Don	1
Quixote’s	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
low	1
plaintive	1
voice	1
answered,	1
“Señor	1
Don	1
Quixote—if	1
so	1
be	1
you	1
are	1
indeed	1
Don	1
Quixote—I	1
am	1
no	1
phantom	1
or	1
spectre	1
or	1
soul	1
in	1
purgatory,	1
as	1
you	1
seem	1
to	1
think,	1
but	1
Doña	1
Rodriguez,	1
duenna	1
of	1
honour	1
to	1
my	1
lady	1
the	1
duchess,	1
and	1
I	1
come	1
to	1
you	1
with	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
grievances	1
your	1
worship	1
is	1
wont	1
to	1
redress.”	1
“Tell	1
me,	1
Señora	1
Doña	1
Rodriguez,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“do	1
you	1
perchance	1
come	1
to	1
transact	1
any	1
go-between	1
business?	1
Because	1
I	1
must	1
tell	1
you	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
available	1
for	1
anybody’s	1
purpose,	1
thanks	1
to	1
the	1
peerless	1
beauty	1
of	1
my	1
lady	1
Dulcinea	1
del	1
Toboso.	1
In	1
short,	1
Señora	1
Doña	1
Rodriguez,	1
if	1
you	1
will	1
leave	1
out	1
and	1
put	1
aside	1
all	1
love	1
messages,	1
you	1
may	1
go	1
and	1
light	1
your	1
candle	1
and	1
come	1
back,	1
and	1
we	1
will	1
discuss	1
all	1
the	1
commands	1
you	1
have	1
for	1
me	1
and	1
whatever	1
you	1
wish,	1
saving	1
only,	1
as	1
I	1
said,	1
all	1
seductive	1
communications.”	1
“I	1
carry	1
nobody’s	1
messages,	1
señor,”	1
said	1
the	1
duenna;	1
“little	1
you	1
know	1
me.	1
Nay,	1
I’m	1
not	1
far	1
enough	1
advanced	1
in	1
years	1
to	1
take	1
to	1
any	1
such	1
childish	1
tricks.	1
God	1
be	1
praised	1
I	1
have	1
a	1
soul	1
in	1
my	1
body	1
still,	1
and	1
all	1
my	1
teeth	1
and	1
grinders	1
in	1
my	1
mouth,	1
except	1
one	1
or	1
two	1
that	1
the	1
colds,	1
so	1
common	1
in	1
this	1
Aragon	1
country,	1
have	1
robbed	1
me	1
of.	1
But	1
wait	1
a	1
little,	1
while	1
I	1
go	1
and	1
light	1
my	1
candle,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
return	1
immediately	1
and	1
lay	1
my	1
sorrows	1
before	1
you	1
as	1
before	1
one	1
who	1
relieves	1
those	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
world;”	1
and	1
without	1
staying	1
for	1
an	1
answer	1
she	1
quitted	1
the	1
room	1
and	1
left	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
tranquilly	1
meditating	1
while	1
he	1
waited	1
for	1
her.	1
A	1
thousand	1
thoughts	1
at	1
once	1
suggested	1
themselves	1
to	1
him	1
on	1
the	1
subject	1
of	1
this	1
new	1
adventure,	1
and	1
it	1
struck	1
him	1
as	1
being	1
ill	1
done	1
and	1
worse	1
advised	1
in	1
him	1
to	1
expose	1
himself	1
to	1
the	1
danger	1
of	1
breaking	1
his	1
plighted	1
faith	1
to	1
his	1
lady;	1
and	1
said	1
he	1
to	1
himself,	1
“Who	1
knows	1
but	1
that	1
the	1
devil,	1
being	1
wily	1
and	1
cunning,	1
may	1
be	1
trying	1
now	1
to	1
entrap	1
me	1
with	1
a	1
duenna,	1
having	1
failed	1
with	1
empresses,	1
queens,	1
duchesses,	1
marchionesses,	1
and	1
countesses?	1
Many	1
a	1
time	1
have	1
I	1
heard	1
it	1
said	1
by	1
many	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
sense	1
that	1
he	1
will	1
sooner	1
offer	1
you	1
a	1
flat-nosed	1
wench	1
than	1
a	1
roman-nosed	1
one;	1
and	1
who	1
knows	1
but	1
this	1
privacy,	1
this	1
opportunity,	1
this	1
silence,	1
may	1
awaken	1
my	1
sleeping	1
desires,	1
and	1
lead	1
me	1
in	1
these	1
my	1
latter	1
years	1
to	1
fall	1
where	1
I	1
have	1
never	1
tripped?	1
In	1
cases	1
of	1
this	1
sort	1
it	1
is	1
better	1
to	1
flee	1
than	1
to	1
await	1
the	1
battle.	1
But	1
I	1
must	1
be	1
out	1
of	1
my	1
senses	1
to	1
think	1
and	1
utter	1
such	1
nonsense;	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
impossible	1
that	1
a	1
long,	1
white-hooded	1
spectacled	1
duenna	1
could	1
stir	1
up	1
or	1
excite	1
a	1
wanton	1
thought	1
in	1
the	1
most	1
graceless	1
bosom	1
in	1
the	1
world.	1
Is	1
there	1
a	1
duenna	1
on	1
earth	1
that	1
has	1
fair	1
flesh?	1
Is	1
there	1
a	1
duenna	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
that	1
escapes	1
being	1
ill-tempered,	1
wrinkled,	1
and	1
prudish?	1
Avaunt,	1
then,	1
ye	1
duenna	1
crew,	1
undelightful	1
to	1
all	1
mankind.	1
Oh,	1
but	1
that	1
lady	1
did	1
well	1
who,	1
they	1
say,	1
had	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
her	1
reception	1
room	1
a	1
couple	1
of	1
figures	1
of	1
duennas	1
with	1
spectacles	1
and	1
lace-cushions,	1
as	1
if	1
at	1
work,	1
and	1
those	1
statues	1
served	1
quite	1
as	1
well	1
to	1
give	1
an	1
air	1
of	1
propriety	1
to	1
the	1
room	1
as	1
if	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
real	1
duennas.”	1
So	1
saying	1
he	1
leaped	1
off	1
the	1
bed,	1
intending	1
to	1
close	1
the	1
door	1
and	1
not	1
allow	1
Señora	1
Rodriguez	1
to	1
enter;	1
but	1
as	1
he	1
went	1
to	1
shut	1
it	1
Señora	1
Rodriguez	1
returned	1
with	1
a	1
wax	1
candle	1
lighted,	1
and	1
having	1
a	1
closer	1
view	1
of	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
with	1
the	1
coverlet	1
round	1
him,	1
and	1
his	1
bandages	1
and	1
night-cap,	1
she	1
was	1
alarmed	1
afresh,	1
and	1
retreating	1
a	1
couple	1
of	1
paces,	1
exclaimed,	1
“Am	1
I	1
safe,	1
sir	1
knight?	1
for	1
I	1
don’t	1
look	1
upon	1
it	1
as	1
a	1
sign	1
of	1
very	1
great	1
virtue	1
that	1
your	1
worship	1
should	1
have	1
got	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
bed.”	1
“I	1
may	1
well	1
ask	1
the	1
same,	1
señora,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
“and	1
I	1
do	1
ask	1
whether	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
safe	1
from	1
being	1
assailed	1
and	1
forced?”	1
“Of	1
whom	1
and	1
against	1
whom	1
do	1
you	1
demand	1
that	1
security,	1
sir	1
knight?”	1
said	1
the	1
duenna.	1
“Of	1
you	1
and	1
against	1
you	1
I	1
ask	1
it,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
“for	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
marble,	1
nor	1
are	1
you	1
brass,	1
nor	1
is	1
it	1
now	1
ten	1
o’clock	1
in	1
the	1
morning,	1
but	1
midnight,	1
or	1
a	1
trifle	1
past	1
it	1
I	1
fancy,	1
and	1
we	1
are	1
in	1
a	1
room	1
more	1
secluded	1
and	1
retired	1
than	1
the	1
cave	1
could	1
have	1
been	1
where	1
the	1
treacherous	1
and	1
daring	1
Æneas	1
enjoyed	1
the	1
fair	1
soft-hearted	1
Dido.	1
But	1
give	1
me	1
your	1
hand,	1
señora;	1
I	1
require	1
no	1
better	1
protection	1
than	1
my	1
own	1
continence,	1
and	1
my	1
own	1
sense	1
of	1
propriety;	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
inspired	1
by	1
that	1
venerable	1
head-dress;”	1
and	1
so	1
saying	1
he	1
kissed	1
her	1
right	1
hand	1
and	1
took	1
it	1
in	1
his	1
own,	1
she	1
yielding	1
it	1
to	1
him	1
with	1
equal	1
ceremoniousness.	1
And	1
here	1
Cide	1
Hamete	1
inserts	1
a	1
parenthesis	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
says	1
that	1
to	1
have	1
seen	1
the	1
pair	1
marching	1
from	1
the	1
door	1
to	1
the	1
bed,	1
linked	1
hand	1
in	1
hand	1
in	1
this	1
way,	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
given	1
the	1
best	1
of	1
the	1
two	1
tunics	1
he	1
had.	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
finally	1
got	1
into	1
bed,	1
and	1
Doña	1
Rodriguez	1
took	1
her	1
seat	1
on	1
a	1
chair	1
at	1
some	1
little	1
distance	1
from	1
his	1
couch,	1
without	1
taking	1
off	1
her	1
spectacles	1
or	1
putting	1
aside	1
the	1
candle.	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
wrapped	1
the	1
bedclothes	1
round	1
him	1
and	1
covered	1
himself	1
up	1
completely,	1
leaving	1
nothing	1
but	1
his	1
face	1
visible,	1
and	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
they	1
had	1
both	1
regained	1
their	1
composure	1
he	1
broke	1
silence,	1
saying,	1
“Now,	1
Señora	1
Doña	1
Rodriguez,	1
you	1
may	1
unbosom	1
yourself	1
and	1
out	1
with	1
everything	1
you	1
have	1
in	1
your	1
sorrowful	1
heart	1
and	1
afflicted	1
bowels;	1
and	1
by	1
me	1
you	1
shall	1
be	1
listened	1
to	1
with	1
chaste	1
ears,	1
and	1
aided	1
by	1
compassionate	1
exertions.”	1
“I	1
believe	1
it,”	1
replied	1
the	1
duenna;	1
“from	1
your	1
worship’s	1
gentle	1
and	1
winning	1
presence	1
only	1
such	1
a	1
Christian	1
answer	1
could	1
be	1
expected.	1
The	1
fact	1
is,	1
then,	1
Señor	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
that	1
though	1
you	1
see	1
me	1
seated	1
in	1
this	1
chair,	1
here	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
Aragon,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
attire	1
of	1
a	1
despised	1
outcast	1
duenna,	1
I	1
am	1
from	1
the	1
Asturias	1
of	1
Oviedo,	1
and	1
of	1
a	1
family	1
with	1
which	1
many	1
of	1
the	1
best	1
of	1
the	1
province	1
are	1
connected	1
by	1
blood;	1
but	1
my	1
untoward	1
fate	1
and	1
the	1
improvidence	1
of	1
my	1
parents,	1
who,	1
I	1
know	1
not	1
how,	1
were	1
unseasonably	1
reduced	1
to	1
poverty,	1
brought	1
me	1
to	1
the	1
court	1
of	1
Madrid,	1
where	1
as	1
a	1
provision	1
and	1
to	1
avoid	1
greater	1
misfortunes,	1
my	1
parents	1
placed	1
me	1
as	1
seamstress	1
in	1
the	1
service	1
of	1
a	1
lady	1
of	1
quality,	1
and	1
I	1
would	1
have	1
you	1
know	1
that	1
for	1
hemming	1
and	1
sewing	1
I	1
have	1
never	1
been	1
surpassed	1
by	1
any	1
all	1
my	1
life.	1
My	1
parents	1
left	1
me	1
in	1
service	1
and	1
returned	1
to	1
their	1
own	1
country,	1
and	1
a	1
few	1
years	1
later	1
went,	1
no	1
doubt,	1
to	1
heaven,	1
for	1
they	1
were	1
excellent	1
good	1
Catholic	1
Christians.	1
I	1
was	1
left	1
an	1
orphan	1
with	1
nothing	1
but	1
the	1
miserable	1
wages	1
and	1
trifling	1
presents	1
that	1
are	1
given	1
to	1
servants	1
of	1
my	1
sort	1
in	1
palaces;	1
but	1
about	1
this	1
time,	1
without	1
any	1
encouragement	1
on	1
my	1
part,	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
esquires	1
of	1
the	1
household	1
fell	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
me,	1
a	1
man	1
somewhat	1
advanced	1
in	1
years,	1
full-bearded	1
and	1
personable,	1
and	1
above	1
all	1
as	1
good	1
a	1
gentleman	1
as	1
the	1
king	1
himself,	1
for	1
he	1
came	1
of	1
a	1
mountain	1
stock.	1
We	1
did	1
not	1
carry	1
on	1
our	1
loves	1
with	1
such	1
secrecy	1
but	1
that	1
they	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
my	1
lady,	1
and	1
she,	1
not	1
to	1
have	1
any	1
fuss	1
about	1
it,	1
had	1
us	1
married	1
with	1
the	1
full	1
sanction	1
of	1
the	1
holy	1
mother	1
Roman	1
Catholic	1
Church,	1
of	1
which	1
marriage	1
a	1
daughter	1
was	1
born	1
to	1
put	1
an	1
end	1
to	1
my	1
good	1
fortune,	1
if	1
I	1
had	1
any;	1
not	1
that	1
I	1
died	1
in	1
childbirth,	1
for	1
I	1
passed	1
through	1
it	1
safely	1
and	1
in	1
due	1
season,	1
but	1
because	1
shortly	1
afterwards	1
my	1
husband	1
died	1
of	1
a	1
certain	1
shock	1
he	1
received,	1
and	1
had	1
I	1
time	1
to	1
tell	1
you	1
of	1
it	1
I	1
know	1
your	1
worship	1
would	1
be	1
surprised;”	1
and	1
here	1
she	1
began	1
to	1
weep	1
bitterly	1
and	1
said,	1
“Pardon	1
me,	1
Señor	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
if	1
I	1
am	1
unable	1
to	1
control	1
myself,	1
for	1
every	1
time	1
I	1
think	1
of	1
my	1
unfortunate	1
husband	1
my	1
eyes	1
fill	1
up	1
with	1
tears.	1
God	1
bless	1
me,	1
with	1
what	1
an	1
air	1
of	1
dignity	1
he	1
used	1
to	1
carry	1
my	1
lady	1
behind	1
him	1
on	1
a	1
stout	1
mule	1
as	1
black	1
as	1
jet!	1
for	1
in	1
those	1
days	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
use	1
coaches	1
or	1
chairs,	1
as	1
they	1
say	1
they	1
do	1
now,	1
and	1
ladies	1
rode	1
behind	1
their	1
squires.	1
This	1
much	1
at	1
least	1
I	1
cannot	1
help	1
telling	1
you,	1
that	1
you	1
may	1
observe	1
the	1
good	1
breeding	1
and	1
punctiliousness	1
of	1
my	1
worthy	1
husband.	1
As	1
he	1
was	1
turning	1
into	1
the	1
Calle	1
de	1
Santiago	1
in	1
Madrid,	1
which	1
is	1
rather	1
narrow,	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
alcaldes	1
of	1
the	1
Court,	1
with	1
two	1
alguacils	1
before	1
him,	1
was	1
coming	1
out	1
of	1
it,	1
and	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
my	1
good	1
squire	1
saw	1
him	1
he	1
wheeled	1
his	1
mule	1
about	1
and	1
made	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
would	1
turn	1
and	1
accompany	1
him.	1
My	1
lady,	1
who	1
was	1
riding	1
behind	1
him,	1
said	1
to	1
him	1
in	1
a	1
low	1
voice,	1
‘What	1
are	1
you	1
about,	1
you	1
sneak,	1
don’t	1
you	1
see	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
here?’	1
The	1
alcalde	1
like	1
a	1
polite	1
man	1
pulled	1
up	1
his	1
horse	1
and	1
said	1
to	1
him,	1
‘Proceed,	1
señor,	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
I,	1
rather,	1
who	1
ought	1
to	1
accompany	1
my	1
lady	1
Doña	1
Casilda’—for	1
that	1
was	1
my	1
mistress’s	1
name.	1
Still	1
my	1
husband,	1
cap	1
in	1
hand,	1
persisted	1
in	1
trying	1
to	1
accompany	1
the	1
alcalde,	1
and	1
seeing	1
this	1
my	1
lady,	1
filled	1
with	1
rage	1
and	1
vexation,	1
pulled	1
out	1
a	1
big	1
pin,	1
or,	1
I	1
rather	1
think,	1
a	1
bodkin,	1
out	1
of	1
her	1
needle-case	1
and	1
drove	1
it	1
into	1
his	1
back	1
with	1
such	1
force	1
that	1
my	1
husband	1
gave	1
a	1
loud	1
yell,	1
and	1
writhing	1
fell	1
to	1
the	1
ground	1
with	1
his	1
lady.	1
Her	1
two	1
lacqueys	1
ran	1
to	1
rise	1
her	1
up,	1
and	1
the	1
alcalde	1
and	1
the	1
alguacils	1
did	1
the	1
same;	1
the	1
Guadalajara	1
gate	1
was	1
all	1
in	1
commotion—I	1
mean	1
the	1
idlers	1
congregated	1
there;	1
my	1
mistress	1
came	1
back	1
on	1
foot,	1
and	1
my	1
husband	1
hurried	1
away	1
to	1
a	1
barber’s	1
shop	1
protesting	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
run	1
right	1
through	1
the	1
guts.	1
The	1
courtesy	1
of	1
my	1
husband	1
was	1
noised	1
abroad	1
to	1
such	1
an	1
extent,	1
that	1
the	1
boys	1
gave	1
him	1
no	1
peace	1
in	1
the	1
street;	1
and	1
on	1
this	1
account,	1
and	1
because	1
he	1
was	1
somewhat	1
shortsighted,	1
my	1
lady	1
dismissed	1
him;	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
chagrin	1
at	1
this	1
I	1
am	1
convinced	1
beyond	1
a	1
doubt	1
that	1
brought	1
on	1
his	1
death.	1
I	1
was	1
left	1
a	1
helpless	1
widow,	1
with	1
a	1
daughter	1
on	1
my	1
hands	1
growing	1
up	1
in	1
beauty	1
like	1
the	1
sea-foam;	1
at	1
length,	1
however,	1
as	1
I	1
had	1
the	1
character	1
of	1
being	1
an	1
excellent	1
needlewoman,	1
my	1
lady	1
the	1
duchess,	1
then	1
lately	1
married	1
to	1
my	1
lord	1
the	1
duke,	1
offered	1
to	1
take	1
me	1
with	1
her	1
to	1
this	1
kingdom	1
of	1
Aragon,	1
and	1
my	1
daughter	1
also,	1
and	1
here	1
as	1
time	1
went	1
by	1
my	1
daughter	1
grew	1
up	1
and	1
with	1
her	1
all	1
the	1
graces	1
in	1
the	1
world;	1
she	1
sings	1
like	1
a	1
lark,	1
dances	1
quick	1
as	1
thought,	1
foots	1
it	1
like	1
a	1
gipsy,	1
reads	1
and	1
writes	1
like	1
a	1
schoolmaster,	1
and	1
does	1
sums	1
like	1
a	1
miser;	1
of	1
her	1
neatness	1
I	1
say	1
nothing,	1
for	1
the	1
running	1
water	1
is	1
not	1
purer,	1
and	1
her	1
age	1
is	1
now,	1
if	1
my	1
memory	1
serves	1
me,	1
sixteen	1
years	1
five	1
months	1
and	1
three	1
days,	1
one	1
more	1
or	1
less.	1
To	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
point,	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
a	1
very	1
rich	1
farmer,	1
living	1
in	1
a	1
village	1
of	1
my	1
lord	1
the	1
duke’s	1
not	1
very	1
far	1
from	1
here,	1
fell	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
this	1
girl	1
of	1
mine;	1
and	1
in	1
short,	1
how	1
I	1
know	1
not,	1
they	1
came	1
together,	1
and	1
under	1
the	1
promise	1
of	1
marrying	1
her	1
he	1
made	1
a	1
fool	1
of	1
my	1
daughter,	1
and	1
will	1
not	1
keep	1
his	1
word.	1
And	1
though	1
my	1
lord	1
the	1
duke	1
is	1
aware	1
of	1
it	1
(for	1
I	1
have	1
complained	1
to	1
him,	1
not	1
once	1
but	1
many	1
and	1
many	1
a	1
time,	1
and	1
entreated	1
him	1
to	1
order	1
the	1
farmer	1
to	1
marry	1
my	1
daughter),	1
he	1
turns	1
a	1
deaf	1
ear	1
and	1
will	1
scarcely	1
listen	1
to	1
me;	1
the	1
reason	1
being	1
that	1
as	1
the	1
deceiver’s	1
father	1
is	1
so	1
rich,	1
and	1
lends	1
him	1
money,	1
and	1
is	1
constantly	1
going	1
security	1
for	1
his	1
debts,	1
he	1
does	1
not	1
like	1
to	1
offend	1
or	1
annoy	1
him	1
in	1
any	1
way.	1
Now,	1
señor,	1
I	1
want	1
your	1
worship	1
to	1
take	1
it	1
upon	1
yourself	1
to	1
redress	1
this	1
wrong	1
either	1
by	1
entreaty	1
or	1
by	1
arms;	1
for	1
by	1
what	1
all	1
the	1
world	1
says	1
you	1
came	1
into	1
it	1
to	1
redress	1
grievances	1
and	1
right	1
wrongs	1
and	1
help	1
the	1
unfortunate.	1
Let	1
your	1
worship	1
put	1
before	1
you	1
the	1
unprotected	1
condition	1
of	1
my	1
daughter,	1
her	1
youth,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
perfections	1
I	1
have	1
said	1
she	1
possesses;	1
and	1
before	1
God	1
and	1
on	1
my	1
conscience,	1
out	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
damsels	1
my	1
lady	1
has,	1
there	1
is	1
not	1
one	1
that	1
comes	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
sole	1
of	1
her	1
shoe,	1
and	1
the	1
one	1
they	1
call	1
Altisidora,	1
and	1
look	1
upon	1
as	1
the	1
boldest	1
and	1
gayest	1
of	1
them,	1
put	1
in	1
comparison	1
with	1
my	1
daughter,	1
does	1
not	1
come	1
within	1
two	1
leagues	1
of	1
her.	1
For	1
I	1
would	1
have	1
you	1
know,	1
señor,	1
all	1
is	1
not	1
gold	1
that	1
glitters,	1
and	1
that	1
same	1
little	1
Altisidora	1
has	1
more	1
forwardness	1
than	1
good	1
looks,	1
and	1
more	1
impudence	1
than	1
modesty;	1
besides	1
being	1
not	1
very	1
sound,	1
for	1
she	1
has	1
such	1
a	1
disagreeable	1
breath	1
that	1
one	1
cannot	1
bear	1
to	1
be	1
near	1
her	1
for	1
a	1
moment;	1
and	1
even	1
my	1
lady	1
the	1
duchess—but	1
I’ll	1
hold	1
my	1
tongue,	1
for	1
they	1
say	1
that	1
walls	1
have	1
ears.”	1
“For	1
heaven’s	1
sake,	1
Doña	1
Rodriguez,	1
what	1
ails	1
my	1
lady	1
the	1
duchess?”	1
asked	1
Don	1
Quixote.	1
“Adjured	1
in	1
that	1
way,”	1
replied	1
the	1
duenna,	1
“I	1
cannot	1
help	1
answering	1
the	1
question	1
and	1
telling	1
the	1
whole	1
truth.	1
Señor	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
have	1
you	1
observed	1
the	1
comeliness	1
of	1
my	1
lady	1
the	1
duchess,	1
that	1
smooth	1
complexion	1
of	1
hers	1
like	1
a	1
burnished	1
polished	1
sword,	1
those	1
two	1
cheeks	1
of	1
milk	1
and	1
carmine,	1
that	1
gay	1
lively	1
step	1
with	1
which	1
she	1
treads	1
or	1
rather	1
seems	1
to	1
spurn	1
the	1
earth,	1
so	1
that	1
one	1
would	1
fancy	1
she	1
went	1
radiating	1
health	1
wherever	1
she	1
passed?	1
Well	1
then,	1
let	1
me	1
tell	1
you	1
she	1
may	1
thank,	1
first	1
of	1
all	1
God,	1
for	1
this,	1
and	1
next,	1
two	1
issues	1
that	1
she	1
has,	1
one	1
in	1
each	1
leg,	1
by	1
which	1
all	1
the	1
evil	1
humours,	1
of	1
which	1
the	1
doctors	1
say	1
she	1
is	1
full,	1
are	1
discharged.”	1
“Blessed	1
Virgin!”	1
exclaimed	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
“and	1
is	1
it	1
possible	1
that	1
my	1
lady	1
the	1
duchess	1
has	1
drains	1
of	1
that	1
sort?	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
believed	1
it	1
if	1
the	1
barefoot	1
friars	1
had	1
told	1
it	1
me;	1
but	1
as	1
the	1
lady	1
Doña	1
Rodriguez	1
says	1
so,	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
so.	1
But	1
surely	1
such	1
issues,	1
and	1
in	1
such	1
places,	1
do	1
not	1
discharge	1
humours,	1
but	1
liquid	1
amber.	1
Verily,	1
I	1
do	1
believe	1
now	1
that	1
this	1
practice	1
of	1
opening	1
issues	1
is	1
a	1
very	1
important	1
matter	1
for	1
the	1
health.”	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
had	1
hardly	1
said	1
this,	1
when	1
the	1
chamber	1
door	1
flew	1
open	1
with	1
a	1
loud	1
bang,	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
start	1
the	1
noise	1
gave	1
her	1
Doña	1
Rodriguez	1
let	1
the	1
candle	1
fall	1
from	1
her	1
hand,	1
and	1
the	1
room	1
was	1
left	1
as	1
dark	1
as	1
a	1
wolf’s	1
mouth,	1
as	1
the	1
saying	1
is.	1
Suddenly	1
the	1
poor	1
duenna	1
felt	1
two	1
hands	1
seize	1
her	1
by	1
the	1
throat,	1
so	1
tightly	1
that	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
croak,	1
while	1
someone	1
else,	1
without	1
uttering	1
a	1
word,	1
very	1
briskly	1
hoisted	1
up	1
her	1
petticoats,	1
and	1
with	1
what	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
slipper	1
began	1
to	1
lay	1
on	1
so	1
heartily	1
that	1
anyone	1
would	1
have	1
felt	1
pity	1
for	1
her;	1
but	1
although	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
felt	1
it	1
he	1
never	1
stirred	1
from	1
his	1
bed,	1
but	1
lay	1
quiet	1
and	1
silent,	1
nay	1
apprehensive	1
that	1
his	1
turn	1
for	1
a	1
drubbing	1
might	1
be	1
coming.	1
Nor	1
was	1
the	1
apprehension	1
an	1
idle	1
one;	1
for	1
leaving	1
the	1
duenna	1
(who	1
did	1
not	1
dare	1
to	1
cry	1
out)	1
well	1
basted,	1
the	1
silent	1
executioners	1
fell	1
upon	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
and	1
stripping	1
him	1
of	1
the	1
sheet	1
and	1
the	1
coverlet,	1
they	1
pinched	1
him	1
so	1
fast	1
and	1
so	1
hard	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
driven	1
to	1
defend	1
himself	1
with	1
his	1
fists,	1
and	1
all	1
this	1
in	1
marvellous	1
silence.	1
The	1
battle	1
lasted	1
nearly	1
half	1
an	1
hour,	1
and	1
then	1
the	1
phantoms	1
fled;	1
Doña	1
Rodriguez	1
gathered	1
up	1
her	1
skirts,	1
and	1
bemoaning	1
her	1
fate	1
went	1
out	1
without	1
saying	1
a	1
word	1
to	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
and	1
he,	1
sorely	1
pinched,	1
puzzled,	1
and	1
dejected,	1
remained	1
alone,	1
and	1
there	1
we	1
will	1
leave	1
him,	1
wondering	1
who	1
could	1
have	1
been	1
the	1
perverse	1
enchanter	1
who	1
had	1
reduced	1
him	1
to	1
such	1
a	1
state;	1
but	1
that	1
shall	1
be	1
told	1
in	1
due	1
season,	1
for	1
Sancho	1
claims	1
our	1
attention,	1
and	1
the	1
methodical	1
arrangement	1
of	1
the	1
story	1
demands	1
it.	1

We	1
left	1
the	1
great	1
governor	1
angered	1
and	1
irritated	1
by	1
that	1
portrait-painting	1
rogue	1
of	1
a	1
farmer	1
who,	1
instructed	1
the	1
majordomo,	1
as	1
the	1
majordomo	1
was	1
by	1
the	1
duke,	1
tried	1
to	1
practise	1
upon	1
him;	1
he	1
however,	1
fool,	1
boor,	1
and	1
clown	1
as	1
he	1
was,	1
held	1
his	1
own	1
against	1
them	1
all,	1
saying	1
to	1
those	1
round	1
him	1
and	1
to	1
Doctor	1
Pedro	1
Recio,	1
who	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
the	1
private	1
business	1
of	1
the	1
duke’s	1
letter	1
was	1
disposed	1
of	1
had	1
returned	1
to	1
the	1
room,	1
“Now	1
I	1
see	1
plainly	1
enough	1
that	1
judges	1
and	1
governors	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
and	1
must	1
be	1
made	1
of	1
brass	1
not	1
to	1
feel	1
the	1
importunities	1
of	1
the	1
applicants	1
that	1
at	1
all	1
times	1
and	1
all	1
seasons	1
insist	1
on	1
being	1
heard,	1
and	1
having	1
their	1
business	1
despatched,	1
and	1
their	1
own	1
affairs	1
and	1
no	1
others	1
attended	1
to,	1
come	1
what	1
may;	1
and	1
if	1
the	1
poor	1
judge	1
does	1
not	1
hear	1
them	1
and	1
settle	1
the	1
matter—either	1
because	1
he	1
cannot	1
or	1
because	1
that	1
is	1
not	1
the	1
time	1
set	1
apart	1
for	1
hearing	1
them—forthwith	1
they	1
abuse	1
him,	1
and	1
run	1
him	1
down,	1
and	1
gnaw	1
at	1
his	1
bones,	1
and	1
even	1
pick	1
holes	1
in	1
his	1
pedigree.	1
You	1
silly,	1
stupid	1
applicant,	1
don’t	1
be	1
in	1
a	1
hurry;	1
wait	1
for	1
the	1
proper	1
time	1
and	1
season	1
for	1
doing	1
business;	1
don’t	1
come	1
at	1
dinner-hour,	1
or	1
at	1
bed-time;	1
for	1
judges	1
are	1
only	1
flesh	1
and	1
blood,	1
and	1
must	1
give	1
to	1
Nature	1
what	1
she	1
naturally	1
demands	1
of	1
them;	1
all	1
except	1
myself,	1
for	1
in	1
my	1
case	1
I	1
give	1
her	1
nothing	1
to	1
eat,	1
thanks	1
to	1
Señor	1
Doctor	1
Pedro	1
Recio	1
Tirteafuera	1
here,	1
who	1
would	1
have	1
me	1
die	1
of	1
hunger,	1
and	1
declares	1
that	1
death	1
to	1
be	1
life;	1
and	1
the	1
same	1
sort	1
of	1
life	1
may	1
God	1
give	1
him	1
and	1
all	1
his	1
kind—I	1
mean	1
the	1
bad	1
doctors;	1
for	1
the	1
good	1
ones	1
deserve	1
palms	1
and	1
laurels.”	1
All	1
who	1
knew	1
Sancho	1
Panza	1
were	1
astonished	1
to	1
hear	1
him	1
speak	1
so	1
elegantly,	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
what	1
to	1
attribute	1
it	1
to	1
unless	1
it	1
were	1
that	1
office	1
and	1
grave	1
responsibility	1
either	1
smarten	1
or	1
stupefy	1
men’s	1
wits.	1
At	1
last	1
Doctor	1
Pedro	1
Recio	1
Agilers	1
of	1
Tirteafuera	1
promised	1
to	1
let	1
him	1
have	1
supper	1
that	1
night	1
though	1
it	1
might	1
be	1
in	1
contravention	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
aphorisms	1
of	1
Hippocrates.	1
With	1
this	1
the	1
governor	1
was	1
satisfied	1
and	1
looked	1
forward	1
to	1
the	1
approach	1
of	1
night	1
and	1
supper-time	1
with	1
great	1
anxiety;	1
and	1
though	1
time,	1
to	1
his	1
mind,	1
stood	1
still	1
and	1
made	1
no	1
progress,	1
nevertheless	1
the	1
hour	1
he	1
so	1
longed	1
for	1
came,	1
and	1
they	1
gave	1
him	1
a	1
beef	1
salad	1
with	1
onions	1
and	1
some	1
boiled	1
calves’	1
feet	1
rather	1
far	1
gone.	1
At	1
this	1
he	1
fell	1
to	1
with	1
greater	1
relish	1
than	1
if	1
they	1
had	1
given	1
him	1
francolins	1
from	1
Milan,	1
pheasants	1
from	1
Rome,	1
veal	1
from	1
Sorrento,	1
partridges	1
from	1
Moron,	1
or	1
geese	1
from	1
Lavajos,	1
and	1
turning	1
to	1
the	1
doctor	1
at	1
supper	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
him,	1
“Look	1
here,	1
señor	1
doctor,	1
for	1
the	1
future	1
don’t	1
trouble	1
yourself	1
about	1
giving	1
me	1
dainty	1
things	1
or	1
choice	1
dishes	1
to	1
eat,	1
for	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
only	1
taking	1
my	1
stomach	1
off	1
its	1
hinges;	1
it	1
is	1
accustomed	1
to	1
goat,	1
cow,	1
bacon,	1
hung	1
beef,	1
turnips	1
and	1
onions;	1
and	1
if	1
by	1
any	1
chance	1
it	1
is	1
given	1
these	1
palace	1
dishes,	1
it	1
receives	1
them	1
squeamishly,	1
and	1
sometimes	1
with	1
loathing.	1
What	1
the	1
head-carver	1
had	1
best	1
do	1
is	1
to	1
serve	1
me	1
with	1
what	1
they	1
call	1
ollas	1
podridas	1
(and	1
the	1
rottener	1
they	1
are	1
the	1
better	1
they	1
smell);	1
and	1
he	1
can	1
put	1
whatever	1
he	1
likes	1
into	1
them,	1
so	1
long	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
good	1
to	1
eat,	1
and	1
I’ll	1
be	1
obliged	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
will	1
requite	1
him	1
some	1
day.	1
But	1
let	1
nobody	1
play	1
pranks	1
on	1
me,	1
for	1
either	1
we	1
are	1
or	1
we	1
are	1
not;	1
let	1
us	1
live	1
and	1
eat	1
in	1
peace	1
and	1
good-fellowship,	1
for	1
when	1
God	1
sends	1
the	1
dawn,	1
he	1
sends	1
it	1
for	1
all.	1
I	1
mean	1
to	1
govern	1
this	1
island	1
without	1
giving	1
up	1
a	1
right	1
or	1
taking	1
a	1
bribe;	1
let	1
everyone	1
keep	1
his	1
eye	1
open,	1
and	1
look	1
out	1
for	1
the	1
arrow;	1
for	1
I	1
can	1
tell	1
them	1
‘the	1
devil’s	1
in	1
Cantillana,’	1
and	1
if	1
they	1
drive	1
me	1
to	1
it	1
they’ll	1
see	1
something	1
that	1
will	1
astonish	1
them.	1
Nay!	1
make	1
yourself	1
honey	1
and	1
the	1
flies	1
eat	1
you.”	1
“Of	1
a	1
truth,	1
señor	1
governor,”	1
said	1
the	1
carver,	1
“your	1
worship	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
right	1
of	1
it	1
in	1
everything	1
you	1
have	1
said;	1
and	1
I	1
promise	1
you	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
this	1
island	1
that	1
they	1
will	1
serve	1
your	1
worship	1
with	1
all	1
zeal,	1
affection,	1
and	1
good-will,	1
for	1
the	1
mild	1
kind	1
of	1
government	1
you	1
have	1
given	1
a	1
sample	1
of	1
to	1
begin	1
with,	1
leaves	1
them	1
no	1
ground	1
for	1
doing	1
or	1
thinking	1
anything	1
to	1
your	1
worship’s	1
disadvantage.”	1
“That	1
I	1
believe,”	1
said	1
Sancho;	1
“and	1
they	1
would	1
be	1
great	1
fools	1
if	1
they	1
did	1
or	1
thought	1
otherwise;	1
once	1
more	1
I	1
say,	1
see	1
to	1
my	1
feeding	1
and	1
my	1
Dapple’s	1
for	1
that	1
is	1
the	1
great	1
point	1
and	1
what	1
is	1
most	1
to	1
the	1
purpose;	1
and	1
when	1
the	1
hour	1
comes	1
let	1
us	1
go	1
the	1
rounds,	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
my	1
intention	1
to	1
purge	1
this	1
island	1
of	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
uncleanness	1
and	1
of	1
all	1
idle	1
good-for-nothing	1
vagabonds;	1
for	1
I	1
would	1
have	1
you	1
know	1
that	1
lazy	1
idlers	1
are	1
the	1
same	1
thing	1
in	1
a	1
State	1
as	1
the	1
drones	1
in	1
a	1
hive,	1
that	1
eat	1
up	1
the	1
honey	1
the	1
industrious	1
bees	1
make.	1
I	1
mean	1
to	1
protect	1
the	1
husbandman,	1
to	1
preserve	1
to	1
the	1
gentleman	1
his	1
privileges,	1
to	1
reward	1
the	1
virtuous,	1
and	1
above	1
all	1
to	1
respect	1
religion	1
and	1
honour	1
its	1
ministers.	1
What	1
say	1
you	1
to	1
that,	1
my	1
friends?	1
Is	1
there	1
anything	1
in	1
what	1
I	1
say,	1
or	1
am	1
I	1
talking	1
to	1
no	1
purpose?”	1
“There	1
is	1
so	1
much	1
in	1
what	1
your	1
worship	1
says,	1
señor	1
governor,”	1
said	1
the	1
majordomo,	1
“that	1
I	1
am	1
filled	1
with	1
wonder	1
when	1
I	1
see	1
a	1
man	1
like	1
your	1
worship,	1
entirely	1
without	1
learning	1
(for	1
I	1
believe	1
you	1
have	1
none	1
at	1
all),	1
say	1
such	1
things,	1
and	1
so	1
full	1
of	1
sound	1
maxims	1
and	1
sage	1
remarks,	1
very	1
different	1
from	1
what	1
was	1
expected	1
of	1
your	1
worship’s	1
intelligence	1
by	1
those	1
who	1
sent	1
us	1
or	1
by	1
us	1
who	1
came	1
here.	1
Every	1
day	1
we	1
see	1
something	1
new	1
in	1
this	1
world;	1
jokes	1
become	1
realities,	1
and	1
the	1
jokers	1
find	1
the	1
tables	1
turned	1
upon	1
them.”	1
Night	1
came,	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
permission	1
of	1
Doctor	1
Pedro	1
Recio,	1
the	1
governor	1
had	1
supper.	1
They	1
then	1
got	1
ready	1
to	1
go	1
the	1
rounds,	1
and	1
he	1
started	1
with	1
the	1
majordomo,	1
the	1
secretary,	1
the	1
head-carver,	1
the	1
chronicler	1
charged	1
with	1
recording	1
his	1
deeds,	1
and	1
alguacils	1
and	1
notaries	1
enough	1
to	1
form	1
a	1
fair-sized	1
squadron.	1
In	1
the	1
midst	1
marched	1
Sancho	1
with	1
his	1
staff,	1
as	1
fine	1
a	1
sight	1
as	1
one	1
could	1
wish	1
to	1
see,	1
and	1
but	1
a	1
few	1
streets	1
of	1
the	1
town	1
had	1
been	1
traversed	1
when	1
they	1
heard	1
a	1
noise	1
as	1
of	1
a	1
clashing	1
of	1
swords.	1
They	1
hastened	1
to	1
the	1
spot,	1
and	1
found	1
that	1
the	1
combatants	1
were	1
but	1
two,	1
who	1
seeing	1
the	1
authorities	1
approaching	1
stood	1
still,	1
and	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
exclaimed,	1
“Help,	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
God	1
and	1
the	1
king!	1
Are	1
men	1
to	1
be	1
allowed	1
to	1
rob	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
this	1
town,	1
and	1
rush	1
out	1
and	1
attack	1
people	1
in	1
the	1
very	1
streets?”	1
“Be	1
calm,	1
my	1
good	1
man,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“and	1
tell	1
me	1
what	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
this	1
quarrel	1
is;	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
governor.”	1
Said	1
the	1
other	1
combatant,	1
“Señor	1
governor,	1
I	1
will	1
tell	1
you	1
in	1
a	1
very	1
few	1
words.	1
Your	1
worship	1
must	1
know	1
that	1
this	1
gentleman	1
has	1
just	1
now	1
won	1
more	1
than	1
a	1
thousand	1
reals	1
in	1
that	1
gambling	1
house	1
opposite,	1
and	1
God	1
knows	1
how.	1
I	1
was	1
there,	1
and	1
gave	1
more	1
than	1
one	1
doubtful	1
point	1
in	1
his	1
favour,	1
very	1
much	1
against	1
what	1
my	1
conscience	1
told	1
me.	1
He	1
made	1
off	1
with	1
his	1
winnings,	1
and	1
when	1
I	1
made	1
sure	1
he	1
was	1
going	1
to	1
give	1
me	1
a	1
crown	1
or	1
so	1
at	1
least	1
by	1
way	1
of	1
a	1
present,	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
usual	1
and	1
customary	1
to	1
give	1
men	1
of	1
quality	1
of	1
my	1
sort	1
who	1
stand	1
by	1
to	1
see	1
fair	1
or	1
foul	1
play,	1
and	1
back	1
up	1
swindles,	1
and	1
prevent	1
quarrels,	1
he	1
pocketed	1
his	1
money	1
and	1
left	1
the	1
house.	1
Indignant	1
at	1
this	1
I	1
followed	1
him,	1
and	1
speaking	1
to	1
him	1
fairly	1
and	1
civilly	1
asked	1
him	1
to	1
give	1
me	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
only	1
eight	1
reals,	1
for	1
he	1
knows	1
I	1
am	1
an	1
honest	1
man	1
and	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
neither	1
profession	1
nor	1
property,	1
for	1
my	1
parents	1
never	1
brought	1
me	1
up	1
to	1
any	1
or	1
left	1
me	1
any;	1
but	1
the	1
rogue,	1
who	1
is	1
a	1
greater	1
thief	1
than	1
Cacus	1
and	1
a	1
greater	1
sharper	1
than	1
Andradilla,	1
would	1
not	1
give	1
me	1
more	1
than	1
four	1
reals;	1
so	1
your	1
worship	1
may	1
see	1
how	1
little	1
shame	1
and	1
conscience	1
he	1
has.	1
But	1
by	1
my	1
faith	1
if	1
you	1
had	1
not	1
come	1
up	1
I’d	1
have	1
made	1
him	1
disgorge	1
his	1
winnings,	1
and	1
he’d	1
have	1
learned	1
what	1
the	1
range	1
of	1
the	1
steel-yard	1
was.”	1
“What	1
say	1
you	1
to	1
this?”	1
asked	1
Sancho.	1
The	1
other	1
replied	1
that	1
all	1
his	1
antagonist	1
said	1
was	1
true,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
choose	1
to	1
give	1
him	1
more	1
than	1
four	1
reals	1
because	1
he	1
very	1
often	1
gave	1
him	1
money;	1
and	1
that	1
those	1
who	1
expected	1
presents	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
civil	1
and	1
take	1
what	1
is	1
given	1
them	1
with	1
a	1
cheerful	1
countenance,	1
and	1
not	1
make	1
any	1
claim	1
against	1
winners	1
unless	1
they	1
know	1
them	1
for	1
certain	1
to	1
be	1
sharpers	1
and	1
their	1
winnings	1
to	1
be	1
unfairly	1
won;	1
and	1
that	1
there	1
could	1
be	1
no	1
better	1
proof	1
that	1
he	1
himself	1
was	1
an	1
honest	1
man	1
than	1
his	1
having	1
refused	1
to	1
give	1
anything;	1
for	1
sharpers	1
always	1
pay	1
tribute	1
to	1
lookers-on	1
who	1
know	1
them.	1
“That	1
is	1
true,”	1
said	1
the	1
majordomo;	1
“let	1
your	1
worship	1
consider	1
what	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
done	1
with	1
these	1
men.”	1
“What	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
done,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“is	1
this;	1
you,	1
the	1
winner,	1
be	1
you	1
good,	1
bad,	1
or	1
indifferent,	1
give	1
this	1
assailant	1
of	1
yours	1
a	1
hundred	1
reals	1
at	1
once,	1
and	1
you	1
must	1
disburse	1
thirty	1
more	1
for	1
the	1
poor	1
prisoners;	1
and	1
you	1
who	1
have	1
neither	1
profession	1
nor	1
property,	1
and	1
hang	1
about	1
the	1
island	1
in	1
idleness,	1
take	1
these	1
hundred	1
reals	1
now,	1
and	1
some	1
time	1
of	1
the	1
day	1
to-morrow	1
quit	1
the	1
island	1
under	1
sentence	1
of	1
banishment	1
for	1
ten	1
years,	1
and	1
under	1
pain	1
of	1
completing	1
it	1
in	1
another	1
life	1
if	1
you	1
violate	1
the	1
sentence,	1
for	1
I’ll	1
hang	1
you	1
on	1
a	1
gibbet,	1
or	1
at	1
least	1
the	1
hangman	1
will	1
by	1
my	1
orders;	1
not	1
a	1
word	1
from	1
either	1
of	1
you,	1
or	1
I’ll	1
make	1
him	1
feel	1
my	1
hand.”	1
The	1
one	1
paid	1
down	1
the	1
money	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
took	1
it,	1
and	1
the	1
latter	1
quitted	1
the	1
island,	1
while	1
the	1
other	1
went	1
home;	1
and	1
then	1
the	1
governor	1
said,	1
“Either	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
good	1
for	1
much,	1
or	1
I’ll	1
get	1
rid	1
of	1
these	1
gambling	1
houses,	1
for	1
it	1
strikes	1
me	1
they	1
are	1
very	1
mischievous.”	1
“This	1
one	1
at	1
least,”	1
said	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
notaries,	1
“your	1
worship	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
get	1
rid	1
of,	1
for	1
a	1
great	1
man	1
owns	1
it,	1
and	1
what	1
he	1
loses	1
every	1
year	1
is	1
beyond	1
all	1
comparison	1
more	1
than	1
what	1
he	1
makes	1
by	1
the	1
cards.	1
On	1
the	1
minor	1
gambling	1
houses	1
your	1
worship	1
may	1
exercise	1
your	1
power,	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
they	1
that	1
do	1
most	1
harm	1
and	1
shelter	1
the	1
most	1
barefaced	1
practices;	1
for	1
in	1
the	1
houses	1
of	1
lords	1
and	1
gentlemen	1
of	1
quality	1
the	1
notorious	1
sharpers	1
dare	1
not	1
attempt	1
to	1
play	1
their	1
tricks;	1
and	1
as	1
the	1
vice	1
of	1
gambling	1
has	1
become	1
common,	1
it	1
is	1
better	1
that	1
men	1
should	1
play	1
in	1
houses	1
of	1
repute	1
than	1
in	1
some	1
tradesman’s,	1
where	1
they	1
catch	1
an	1
unlucky	1
fellow	1
in	1
the	1
small	1
hours	1
of	1
the	1
morning	1
and	1
skin	1
him	1
alive.”	1
“I	1
know	1
already,	1
notary,	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
good	1
deal	1
to	1
be	1
said	1
on	1
that	1
point,”	1
said	1
Sancho.	1
And	1
now	1
a	1
tipstaff	1
came	1
up	1
with	1
a	1
young	1
man	1
in	1
his	1
grasp,	1
and	1
said,	1
“Señor	1
governor,	1
this	1
youth	1
was	1
coming	1
towards	1
us,	1
and	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
saw	1
the	1
officers	1
of	1
justice	1
he	1
turned	1
about	1
and	1
ran	1
like	1
a	1
deer,	1
a	1
sure	1
proof	1
that	1
he	1
must	1
be	1
some	1
evil-doer;	1
I	1
ran	1
after	1
him,	1
and	1
had	1
it	1
not	1
been	1
that	1
he	1
stumbled	1
and	1
fell,	1
I	1
should	1
never	1
have	1
caught	1
him.”	1
“What	1
did	1
you	1
run	1
for,	1
fellow?”	1
said	1
Sancho.	1
To	1
which	1
the	1
young	1
man	1
replied,	1
“Señor,	1
it	1
was	1
to	1
avoid	1
answering	1
all	1
the	1
questions	1
officers	1
of	1
justice	1
put.”	1
“What	1
are	1
you	1
by	1
trade?”	1
“A	1
weaver.”	1
“And	1
what	1
do	1
you	1
weave?”	1
“Lance	1
heads,	1
with	1
your	1
worship’s	1
good	1
leave.”	1
“You’re	1
facetious	1
with	1
me!	1
You	1
plume	1
yourself	1
on	1
being	1
a	1
wag?	1
Very	1
good;	1
and	1
where	1
were	1
you	1
going	1
just	1
now?”	1
“To	1
take	1
the	1
air,	1
señor.”	1
“And	1
where	1
does	1
one	1
take	1
the	1
air	1
in	1
this	1
island?”	1
“Where	1
it	1
blows.”	1
“Good!	1
your	1
answers	1
are	1
very	1
much	1
to	1
the	1
point;	1
you	1
are	1
a	1
smart	1
youth;	1
but	1
take	1
notice	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
air,	1
and	1
that	1
I	1
blow	1
upon	1
you	1
a-stern,	1
and	1
send	1
you	1
to	1
gaol.	1
Ho	1
there!	1
lay	1
hold	1
of	1
him	1
and	1
take	1
him	1
off;	1
I’ll	1
make	1
him	1
sleep	1
there	1
to-night	1
without	1
air.”	1
“By	1
God,”	1
said	1
the	1
young	1
man,	1
“your	1
worship	1
will	1
make	1
me	1
sleep	1
in	1
gaol	1
just	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
make	1
me	1
king.”	1
“Why	1
shan’t	1
I	1
make	1
thee	1
sleep	1
in	1
gaol?”	1
said	1
Sancho.	1
“Have	1
I	1
not	1
the	1
power	1
to	1
arrest	1
thee	1
and	1
release	1
thee	1
whenever	1
I	1
like?”	1
“All	1
the	1
power	1
your	1
worship	1
has,”	1
said	1
the	1
young	1
man,	1
“won’t	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
make	1
me	1
sleep	1
in	1
gaol.”	1
“How?	1
not	1
able!”	1
said	1
Sancho;	1
“take	1
him	1
away	1
at	1
once	1
where	1
he’ll	1
see	1
his	1
mistake	1
with	1
his	1
own	1
eyes,	1
even	1
if	1
the	1
gaoler	1
is	1
willing	1
to	1
exert	1
his	1
interested	1
generosity	1
on	1
his	1
behalf;	1
for	1
I’ll	1
lay	1
a	1
penalty	1
of	1
two	1
thousand	1
ducats	1
on	1
him	1
if	1
he	1
allows	1
him	1
to	1
stir	1
a	1
step	1
from	1
the	1
prison.”	1
“That’s	1
ridiculous,”	1
said	1
the	1
young	1
man;	1
“the	1
fact	1
is,	1
all	1
the	1
men	1
on	1
earth	1
will	1
not	1
make	1
me	1
sleep	1
in	1
prison.”	1
“Tell	1
me,	1
you	1
devil,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“have	1
you	1
got	1
any	1
angel	1
that	1
will	1
deliver	1
you,	1
and	1
take	1
off	1
the	1
irons	1
I	1
am	1
going	1
to	1
order	1
them	1
to	1
put	1
upon	1
you?”	1
“Now,	1
señor	1
governor,”	1
said	1
the	1
young	1
man	1
in	1
a	1
sprightly	1
manner,	1
“let	1
us	1
be	1
reasonable	1
and	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
point.	1
Granted	1
your	1
worship	1
may	1
order	1
me	1
to	1
be	1
taken	1
to	1
prison,	1
and	1
to	1
have	1
irons	1
and	1
chains	1
put	1
on	1
me,	1
and	1
to	1
be	1
shut	1
up	1
in	1
a	1
cell,	1
and	1
may	1
lay	1
heavy	1
penalties	1
on	1
the	1
gaoler	1
if	1
he	1
lets	1
me	1
out,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
obeys	1
your	1
orders;	1
still,	1
if	1
I	1
don’t	1
choose	1
to	1
sleep,	1
and	1
choose	1
to	1
remain	1
awake	1
all	1
night	1
without	1
closing	1
an	1
eye,	1
will	1
your	1
worship	1
with	1
all	1
your	1
power	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
make	1
me	1
sleep	1
if	1
I	1
don’t	1
choose?”	1
“No,	1
truly,”	1
said	1
the	1
secretary,	1
“and	1
the	1
fellow	1
has	1
made	1
his	1
point.”	1
“So	1
then,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“it	1
would	1
be	1
entirely	1
of	1
your	1
own	1
choice	1
you	1
would	1
keep	1
from	1
sleeping;	1
not	1
in	1
opposition	1
to	1
my	1
will?”	1
“No,	1
señor,”	1
said	1
the	1
youth,	1
“certainly	1
not.”	1
“Well	1
then,	1
go,	1
and	1
God	1
be	1
with	1
you,”	1
said	1
Sancho;	1
“be	1
off	1
home	1
to	1
sleep,	1
and	1
God	1
give	1
you	1
sound	1
sleep,	1
for	1
I	1
don’t	1
want	1
to	1
rob	1
you	1
of	1
it;	1
but	1
for	1
the	1
future,	1
let	1
me	1
advise	1
you	1
don’t	1
joke	1
with	1
the	1
authorities,	1
because	1
you	1
may	1
come	1
across	1
someone	1
who	1
will	1
bring	1
down	1
the	1
joke	1
on	1
your	1
own	1
skull.”	1
The	1
young	1
man	1
went	1
his	1
way,	1
and	1
the	1
governor	1
continued	1
his	1
round,	1
and	1
shortly	1
afterwards	1
two	1
tipstaffs	1
came	1
up	1
with	1
a	1
man	1
in	1
custody,	1
and	1
said,	1
“Señor	1
governor,	1
this	1
person,	1
who	1
seems	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
man,	1
is	1
not	1
so,	1
but	1
a	1
woman,	1
and	1
not	1
an	1
ill-favoured	1
one,	1
in	1
man’s	1
clothes.”	1
They	1
raised	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
lanterns	1
to	1
her	1
face,	1
and	1
by	1
their	1
light	1
they	1
distinguished	1
the	1
features	1
of	1
a	1
woman	1
to	1
all	1
appearance	1
of	1
the	1
age	1
of	1
sixteen	1
or	1
a	1
little	1
more,	1
with	1
her	1
hair	1
gathered	1
into	1
a	1
gold	1
and	1
green	1
silk	1
net,	1
and	1
fair	1
as	1
a	1
thousand	1
pearls.	1
They	1
scanned	1
her	1
from	1
head	1
to	1
foot,	1
and	1
observed	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
on	1
red	1
silk	1
stockings	1
with	1
garters	1
of	1
white	1
taffety	1
bordered	1
with	1
gold	1
and	1
pearl;	1
her	1
breeches	1
were	1
of	1
green	1
and	1
gold	1
stuff,	1
and	1
under	1
an	1
open	1
jacket	1
or	1
jerkin	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
she	1
wore	1
a	1
doublet	1
of	1
the	1
finest	1
white	1
and	1
gold	1
cloth;	1
her	1
shoes	1
were	1
white	1
and	1
such	1
as	1
men	1
wear;	1
she	1
carried	1
no	1
sword	1
at	1
her	1
belt,	1
but	1
only	1
a	1
richly	1
ornamented	1
dagger,	1
and	1
on	1
her	1
fingers	1
she	1
had	1
several	1
handsome	1
rings.	1
In	1
short,	1
the	1
girl	1
seemed	1
fair	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
in	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
all,	1
and	1
none	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
beheld	1
her	1
knew	1
her,	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
town	1
said	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
imagine	1
who	1
she	1
was,	1
and	1
those	1
who	1
were	1
in	1
on	1
the	1
secret	1
of	1
the	1
jokes	1
that	1
were	1
to	1
be	1
practised	1
upon	1
Sancho	1
were	1
the	1
ones	1
who	1
were	1
most	1
surprised,	1
for	1
this	1
incident	1
or	1
discovery	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
arranged	1
by	1
them;	1
and	1
they	1
watched	1
anxiously	1
to	1
see	1
how	1
the	1
affair	1
would	1
end.	1
Sancho	1
was	1
fascinated	1
by	1
the	1
girl’s	1
beauty,	1
and	1
he	1
asked	1
her	1
who	1
she	1
was,	1
where	1
she	1
was	1
going,	1
and	1
what	1
had	1
induced	1
her	1
to	1
dress	1
herself	1
in	1
that	1
garb.	1
She	1
with	1
her	1
eyes	1
fixed	1
on	1
the	1
ground	1
answered	1
in	1
modest	1
confusion,	1
“I	1
cannot	1
tell	1
you,	1
señor,	1
before	1
so	1
many	1
people	1
what	1
it	1
is	1
of	1
such	1
consequence	1
to	1
me	1
to	1
have	1
kept	1
secret;	1
one	1
thing	1
I	1
wish	1
to	1
be	1
known,	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
no	1
thief	1
or	1
evildoer,	1
but	1
only	1
an	1
unhappy	1
maiden	1
whom	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
jealousy	1
has	1
led	1
to	1
break	1
through	1
the	1
respect	1
that	1
is	1
due	1
to	1
modesty.”	1
Hearing	1
this	1
the	1
majordomo	1
said	1
to	1
Sancho,	1
“Make	1
the	1
people	1
stand	1
back,	1
señor	1
governor,	1
that	1
this	1
lady	1
may	1
say	1
what	1
she	1
wishes	1
with	1
less	1
embarrassment.”	1
Sancho	1
gave	1
the	1
order,	1
and	1
all	1
except	1
the	1
majordomo,	1
the	1
head-carver,	1
and	1
the	1
secretary	1
fell	1
back.	1
Finding	1
herself	1
then	1
in	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
no	1
more,	1
the	1
damsel	1
went	1
on	1
to	1
say,	1
“I	1
am	1
the	1
daughter,	1
sirs,	1
of	1
Pedro	1
Perez	1
Mazorca,	1
the	1
wool-farmer	1
of	1
this	1
town,	1
who	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
habit	1
of	1
coming	1
very	1
often	1
to	1
my	1
father’s	1
house.”	1
“That	1
won’t	1
do,	1
señora,”	1
said	1
the	1
majordomo;	1
“for	1
I	1
know	1
Pedro	1
Perez	1
very	1
well,	1
and	1
I	1
know	1
he	1
has	1
no	1
child	1
at	1
all,	1
either	1
son	1
or	1
daughter;	1
and	1
besides,	1
though	1
you	1
say	1
he	1
is	1
your	1
father,	1
you	1
add	1
then	1
that	1
he	1
comes	1
very	1
often	1
to	1
your	1
father’s	1
house.”	1
“I	1
had	1
already	1
noticed	1
that,”	1
said	1
Sancho.	1
“I	1
am	1
confused	1
just	1
now,	1
sirs,”	1
said	1
the	1
damsel,	1
“and	1
I	1
don’t	1
know	1
what	1
I	1
am	1
saying;	1
but	1
the	1
truth	1
is	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
Diego	1
de	1
la	1
Llana,	1
whom	1
you	1
must	1
all	1
know.”	1
“Ay,	1
that	1
will	1
do,”	1
said	1
the	1
majordomo;	1
“for	1
I	1
know	1
Diego	1
de	1
la	1
Llana,	1
and	1
know	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
gentleman	1
of	1
position	1
and	1
a	1
rich	1
man,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
has	1
a	1
son	1
and	1
a	1
daughter,	1
and	1
that	1
since	1
he	1
was	1
left	1
a	1
widower	1
nobody	1
in	1
all	1
this	1
town	1
can	1
speak	1
of	1
having	1
seen	1
his	1
daughter’s	1
face;	1
for	1
he	1
keeps	1
her	1
so	1
closely	1
shut	1
up	1
that	1
he	1
does	1
not	1
give	1
even	1
the	1
sun	1
a	1
chance	1
of	1
seeing	1
her;	1
and	1
for	1
all	1
that	1
report	1
says	1
she	1
is	1
extremely	1
beautiful.”	1
“It	1
is	1
true,”	1
said	1
the	1
damsel,	1
“and	1
I	1
am	1
that	1
daughter;	1
whether	1
report	1
lies	1
or	1
not	1
as	1
to	1
my	1
beauty,	1
you,	1
sirs,	1
will	1
have	1
decided	1
by	1
this	1
time,	1
as	1
you	1
have	1
seen	1
me;”	1
and	1
with	1
this	1
she	1
began	1
to	1
weep	1
bitterly.	1
On	1
seeing	1
this	1
the	1
secretary	1
leant	1
over	1
to	1
the	1
head-carver’s	1
ear,	1
and	1
said	1
to	1
him	1
in	1
a	1
low	1
voice,	1
“Something	1
serious	1
has	1
no	1
doubt	1
happened	1
this	1
poor	1
maiden,	1
that	1
she	1
goes	1
wandering	1
from	1
home	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
dress	1
and	1
at	1
such	1
an	1
hour,	1
and	1
one	1
of	1
her	1
rank	1
too.”	1
“There	1
can	1
be	1
no	1
doubt	1
about	1
it,”	1
returned	1
the	1
carver,	1
“and	1
moreover	1
her	1
tears	1
confirm	1
your	1
suspicion.”	1
Sancho	1
gave	1
her	1
the	1
best	1
comfort	1
he	1
could,	1
and	1
entreated	1
her	1
to	1
tell	1
them	1
without	1
any	1
fear	1
what	1
had	1
happened	1
her,	1
as	1
they	1
would	1
all	1
earnestly	1
and	1
by	1
every	1
means	1
in	1
their	1
power	1
endeavour	1
to	1
relieve	1
her.	1
“The	1
fact	1
is,	1
sirs,”	1
said	1
she,	1
“that	1
my	1
father	1
has	1
kept	1
me	1
shut	1
up	1
these	1
ten	1
years,	1
for	1
so	1
long	1
is	1
it	1
since	1
the	1
earth	1
received	1
my	1
mother.	1
Mass	1
is	1
said	1
at	1
home	1
in	1
a	1
sumptuous	1
chapel,	1
and	1
all	1
this	1
time	1
I	1
have	1
seen	1
but	1
the	1
sun	1
in	1
the	1
heaven	1
by	1
day,	1
and	1
the	1
moon	1
and	1
the	1
stars	1
by	1
night;	1
nor	1
do	1
I	1
know	1
what	1
streets	1
are	1
like,	1
or	1
plazas,	1
or	1
churches,	1
or	1
even	1
men,	1
except	1
my	1
father	1
and	1
a	1
brother	1
I	1
have,	1
and	1
Pedro	1
Perez	1
the	1
wool-farmer;	1
whom,	1
because	1
he	1
came	1
frequently	1
to	1
our	1
house,	1
I	1
took	1
it	1
into	1
my	1
head	1
to	1
call	1
my	1
father,	1
to	1
avoid	1
naming	1
my	1
own.	1
This	1
seclusion	1
and	1
the	1
restrictions	1
laid	1
upon	1
my	1
going	1
out,	1
were	1
it	1
only	1
to	1
church,	1
have	1
been	1
keeping	1
me	1
unhappy	1
for	1
many	1
a	1
day	1
and	1
month	1
past;	1
I	1
longed	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
world,	1
or	1
at	1
least	1
the	1
town	1
where	1
I	1
was	1
born,	1
and	1
it	1
did	1
not	1
seem	1
to	1
me	1
that	1
this	1
wish	1
was	1
inconsistent	1
with	1
the	1
respect	1
maidens	1
of	1
good	1
quality	1
should	1
have	1
for	1
themselves.	1
When	1
I	1
heard	1
them	1
talking	1
of	1
bull-fights	1
taking	1
place,	1
and	1
of	1
javelin	1
games,	1
and	1
of	1
acting	1
plays,	1
I	1
asked	1
my	1
brother,	1
who	1
is	1
a	1
year	1
younger	1
than	1
myself,	1
to	1
tell	1
me	1
what	1
sort	1
of	1
things	1
these	1
were,	1
and	1
many	1
more	1
that	1
I	1
had	1
never	1
seen;	1
he	1
explained	1
them	1
to	1
me	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
he	1
could,	1
but	1
the	1
only	1
effect	1
was	1
to	1
kindle	1
in	1
me	1
a	1
still	1
stronger	1
desire	1
to	1
see	1
them.	1
At	1
last,	1
to	1
cut	1
short	1
the	1
story	1
of	1
my	1
ruin,	1
I	1
begged	1
and	1
entreated	1
my	1
brother—O	1
that	1
I	1
had	1
never	1
made	1
such	1
an	1
entreaty—”	1
And	1
once	1
more	1
she	1
gave	1
way	1
to	1
a	1
burst	1
of	1
weeping.	1
“Proceed,	1
señora,”	1
said	1
the	1
majordomo,	1
“and	1
finish	1
your	1
story	1
of	1
what	1
has	1
happened	1
to	1
you,	1
for	1
your	1
words	1
and	1
tears	1
are	1
keeping	1
us	1
all	1
in	1
suspense.”	1
“I	1
have	1
but	1
little	1
more	1
to	1
say,	1
though	1
many	1
a	1
tear	1
to	1
shed,”	1
said	1
the	1
damsel;	1
“for	1
ill-placed	1
desires	1
can	1
only	1
be	1
paid	1
for	1
in	1
some	1
such	1
way.”	1
The	1
maiden’s	1
beauty	1
had	1
made	1
a	1
deep	1
impression	1
on	1
the	1
head-carver’s	1
heart,	1
and	1
he	1
again	1
raised	1
his	1
lantern	1
for	1
another	1
look	1
at	1
her,	1
and	1
thought	1
they	1
were	1
not	1
tears	1
she	1
was	1
shedding,	1
but	1
seed-pearl	1
or	1
dew	1
of	1
the	1
meadow,	1
nay,	1
he	1
exalted	1
them	1
still	1
higher,	1
and	1
made	1
Oriental	1
pearls	1
of	1
them,	1
and	1
fervently	1
hoped	1
her	1
misfortune	1
might	1
not	1
be	1
so	1
great	1
a	1
one	1
as	1
her	1
tears	1
and	1
sobs	1
seemed	1
to	1
indicate.	1
The	1
governor	1
was	1
losing	1
patience	1
at	1
the	1
length	1
of	1
time	1
the	1
girl	1
was	1
taking	1
to	1
tell	1
her	1
story,	1
and	1
told	1
her	1
not	1
to	1
keep	1
them	1
waiting	1
any	1
longer;	1
for	1
it	1
was	1
late,	1
and	1
there	1
still	1
remained	1
a	1
good	1
deal	1
of	1
the	1
town	1
to	1
be	1
gone	1
over.	1
She,	1
with	1
broken	1
sobs	1
and	1
half-suppressed	1
sighs,	1
went	1
on	1
to	1
say,	1
“My	1
misfortune,	1
my	1
misadventure,	1
is	1
simply	1
this,	1
that	1
I	1
entreated	1
my	1
brother	1
to	1
dress	1
me	1
up	1
as	1
a	1
man	1
in	1
a	1
suit	1
of	1
his	1
clothes,	1
and	1
take	1
me	1
some	1
night,	1
when	1
our	1
father	1
was	1
asleep,	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
whole	1
town;	1
he,	1
overcome	1
by	1
my	1
entreaties,	1
consented,	1
and	1
dressing	1
me	1
in	1
this	1
suit	1
and	1
himself	1
in	1
clothes	1
of	1
mine	1
that	1
fitted	1
him	1
as	1
if	1
made	1
for	1
him	1
(for	1
he	1
has	1
not	1
a	1
hair	1
on	1
his	1
chin,	1
and	1
might	1
pass	1
for	1
a	1
very	1
beautiful	1
young	1
girl),	1
to-night,	1
about	1
an	1
hour	1
ago,	1
more	1
or	1
less,	1
we	1
left	1
the	1
house,	1
and	1
guided	1
by	1
our	1
youthful	1
and	1
foolish	1
impulse	1
we	1
made	1
the	1
circuit	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
town,	1
and	1
then,	1
as	1
we	1
were	1
about	1
to	1
return	1
home,	1
we	1
saw	1
a	1
great	1
troop	1
of	1
people	1
coming,	1
and	1
my	1
brother	1
said	1
to	1
me,	1
‘Sister,	1
this	1
must	1
be	1
the	1
round,	1
stir	1
your	1
feet	1
and	1
put	1
wings	1
to	1
them,	1
and	1
follow	1
me	1
as	1
fast	1
as	1
you	1
can,	1
lest	1
they	1
recognise	1
us,	1
for	1
that	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
bad	1
business	1
for	1
us;’	1
and	1
so	1
saying	1
he	1
turned	1
about	1
and	1
began,	1
I	1
cannot	1
say	1
to	1
run	1
but	1
to	1
fly;	1
in	1
less	1
than	1
six	1
paces	1
I	1
fell	1
from	1
fright,	1
and	1
then	1
the	1
officer	1
of	1
justice	1
came	1
up	1
and	1
carried	1
me	1
before	1
your	1
worships,	1
where	1
I	1
find	1
myself	1
put	1
to	1
shame	1
before	1
all	1
these	1
people	1
as	1
whimsical	1
and	1
vicious.”	1
“So	1
then,	1
señora,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“no	1
other	1
mishap	1
has	1
befallen	1
you,	1
nor	1
was	1
it	1
jealousy	1
that	1
made	1
you	1
leave	1
home,	1
as	1
you	1
said	1
at	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
your	1
story?”	1
“Nothing	1
has	1
happened	1
me,”	1
said	1
she,	1
“nor	1
was	1
it	1
jealousy	1
that	1
brought	1
me	1
out,	1
but	1
merely	1
a	1
longing	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
world,	1
which	1
did	1
not	1
go	1
beyond	1
seeing	1
the	1
streets	1
of	1
this	1
town.”	1
The	1
appearance	1
of	1
the	1
tipstaffs	1
with	1
her	1
brother	1
in	1
custody,	1
whom	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
had	1
overtaken	1
as	1
he	1
ran	1
away	1
from	1
his	1
sister,	1
now	1
fully	1
confirmed	1
the	1
truth	1
of	1
what	1
the	1
damsel	1
said.	1
He	1
had	1
nothing	1
on	1
but	1
a	1
rich	1
petticoat	1
and	1
a	1
short	1
blue	1
damask	1
cloak	1
with	1
fine	1
gold	1
lace,	1
and	1
his	1
head	1
was	1
uncovered	1
and	1
adorned	1
only	1
with	1
its	1
own	1
hair,	1
which	1
looked	1
like	1
rings	1
of	1
gold,	1
so	1
bright	1
and	1
curly	1
was	1
it.	1
The	1
governor,	1
the	1
majordomo,	1
and	1
the	1
carver	1
went	1
aside	1
with	1
him,	1
and,	1
unheard	1
by	1
his	1
sister,	1
asked	1
him	1
how	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
that	1
dress,	1
and	1
he	1
with	1
no	1
less	1
shame	1
and	1
embarrassment	1
told	1
exactly	1
the	1
same	1
story	1
as	1
his	1
sister,	1
to	1
the	1
great	1
delight	1
of	1
the	1
enamoured	1
carver;	1
the	1
governor,	1
however,	1
said	1
to	1
them,	1
“In	1
truth,	1
young	1
lady	1
and	1
gentleman,	1
this	1
has	1
been	1
a	1
very	1
childish	1
affair,	1
and	1
to	1
explain	1
your	1
folly	1
and	1
rashness	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
necessity	1
for	1
all	1
this	1
delay	1
and	1
all	1
these	1
tears	1
and	1
sighs;	1
for	1
if	1
you	1
had	1
said	1
we	1
are	1
so-and-so,	1
and	1
we	1
escaped	1
from	1
our	1
father’s	1
house	1
in	1
this	1
way	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
ramble	1
about,	1
out	1
of	1
mere	1
curiosity	1
and	1
with	1
no	1
other	1
object,	1
there	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
an	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
matter,	1
and	1
none	1
of	1
these	1
little	1
sobs	1
and	1
tears	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
it.”	1
“That	1
is	1
true,”	1
said	1
the	1
damsel,	1
“but	1
you	1
see	1
the	1
confusion	1
I	1
was	1
in	1
was	1
so	1
great	1
it	1
did	1
not	1
let	1
me	1
behave	1
as	1
I	1
ought.”	1
“No	1
harm	1
has	1
been	1
done,”	1
said	1
Sancho;	1
“come,	1
we	1
will	1
leave	1
you	1
at	1
your	1
father’s	1
house;	1
perhaps	1
they	1
will	1
not	1
have	1
missed	1
you;	1
and	1
another	1
time	1
don’t	1
be	1
so	1
childish	1
or	1
eager	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
world;	1
for	1
a	1
respectable	1
damsel	1
should	1
have	1
a	1
broken	1
leg	1
and	1
keep	1
at	1
home;	1
and	1
the	1
woman	1
and	1
the	1
hen	1
by	1
gadding	1
about	1
are	1
soon	1
lost;	1
and	1
she	1
who	1
is	1
eager	1
to	1
see	1
is	1
also	1
eager	1
to	1
be	1
seen;	1
I	1
say	1
no	1
more.”	1
The	1
youth	1
thanked	1
the	1
governor	1
for	1
his	1
kind	1
offer	1
to	1
take	1
them	1
home,	1
and	1
they	1
directed	1
their	1
steps	1
towards	1
the	1
house,	1
which	1
was	1
not	1
far	1
off.	1
On	1
reaching	1
it	1
the	1
youth	1
threw	1
a	1
pebble	1
up	1
at	1
a	1
grating,	1
and	1
immediately	1
a	1
woman-servant	1
who	1
was	1
waiting	1
for	1
them	1
came	1
down	1
and	1
opened	1
the	1
door	1
to	1
them,	1
and	1
they	1
went	1
in,	1
leaving	1
the	1
party	1
marvelling	1
as	1
much	1
at	1
their	1
grace	1
and	1
beauty	1
as	1
at	1
the	1
fancy	1
they	1
had	1
for	1
seeing	1
the	1
world	1
by	1
night	1
and	1
without	1
quitting	1
the	1
village;	1
which,	1
however,	1
they	1
set	1
down	1
to	1
their	1
youth.	1
The	1
head-carver	1
was	1
left	1
with	1
a	1
heart	1
pierced	1
through	1
and	1
through,	1
and	1
he	1
made	1
up	1
his	1
mind	1
on	1
the	1
spot	1
to	1
demand	1
the	1
damsel	1
in	1
marriage	1
of	1
her	1
father	1
on	1
the	1
morrow,	1
making	1
sure	1
she	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
refused	1
him	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
servant	1
of	1
the	1
duke’s;	1
and	1
even	1
to	1
Sancho	1
ideas	1
and	1
schemes	1
of	1
marrying	1
the	1
youth	1
to	1
his	1
daughter	1
Sanchica	1
suggested	1
themselves,	1
and	1
he	1
resolved	1
to	1
open	1
the	1
negotiation	1
at	1
the	1
proper	1
season,	1
persuading	1
himself	1
that	1
no	1
husband	1
could	1
be	1
refused	1
to	1
a	1
governor’s	1
daughter.	1
And	1
so	1
the	1
night’s	1
round	1
came	1
to	1
an	1
end,	1
and	1
a	1
couple	1
of	1
days	1
later	1
the	1
government,	1
whereby	1
all	1
his	1
plans	1
were	1
overthrown	1
and	1
swept	1
away,	1
as	1
will	1
be	1
seen	1
farther	1
on.	1

Hamete,	1
the	1
painstaking	1
investigator	1
of	1
the	1
minute	1
points	1
of	1
this	1
veracious	1
history,	1
says	1
that	1
when	1
Doña	1
Rodriguez	1
left	1
her	1
own	1
room	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
Don	1
Quixote’s,	1
another	1
duenna	1
who	1
slept	1
with	1
her	1
observed	1
her,	1
and	1
as	1
all	1
duennas	1
are	1
fond	1
of	1
prying,	1
listening,	1
and	1
sniffing,	1
she	1
followed	1
her	1
so	1
silently	1
that	1
the	1
good	1
Rodriguez	1
never	1
perceived	1
it;	1
and	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
the	1
duenna	1
saw	1
her	1
enter	1
Don	1
Quixote’s	1
room,	1
not	1
to	1
fail	1
in	1
a	1
duenna’s	1
invariable	1
practice	1
of	1
tattling,	1
she	1
hurried	1
off	1
that	1
instant	1
to	1
report	1
to	1
the	1
duchess	1
how	1
Doña	1
Rodriguez	1
was	1
closeted	1
with	1
Don	1
Quixote.	1
The	1
duchess	1
told	1
the	1
duke,	1
and	1
asked	1
him	1
to	1
let	1
her	1
and	1
Altisidora	1
go	1
and	1
see	1
what	1
the	1
said	1
duenna	1
wanted	1
with	1
Don	1
Quixote.	1
The	1
duke	1
gave	1
them	1
leave,	1
and	1
the	1
pair	1
cautiously	1
and	1
quietly	1
crept	1
to	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
and	1
posted	1
themselves	1
so	1
close	1
to	1
it	1
that	1
they	1
could	1
hear	1
all	1
that	1
was	1
said	1
inside.	1
But	1
when	1
the	1
duchess	1
heard	1
how	1
the	1
Rodriguez	1
had	1
made	1
public	1
the	1
Aranjuez	1
of	1
her	1
issues	1
she	1
could	1
not	1
restrain	1
herself,	1
nor	1
Altisidora	1
either;	1
and	1
so,	1
filled	1
with	1
rage	1
and	1
thirsting	1
for	1
vengeance,	1
they	1
burst	1
into	1
the	1
room	1
and	1
tormented	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
and	1
flogged	1
the	1
duenna	1
in	1
the	1
manner	1
already	1
described;	1
for	1
indignities	1
offered	1
to	1
their	1
charms	1
and	1
self-esteem	1
mightily	1
provoke	1
the	1
anger	1
of	1
women	1
and	1
make	1
them	1
eager	1
for	1
revenge.	1
The	1
duchess	1
told	1
the	1
duke	1
what	1
had	1
happened,	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
much	1
amused	1
by	1
it;	1
and	1
she,	1
in	1
pursuance	1
of	1
her	1
design	1
of	1
making	1
merry	1
and	1
diverting	1
herself	1
with	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
despatched	1
the	1
page	1
who	1
had	1
played	1
the	1
part	1
of	1
Dulcinea	1
in	1
the	1
negotiations	1
for	1
her	1
disenchantment	1
(which	1
Sancho	1
Panza	1
in	1
the	1
cares	1
of	1
government	1
had	1
forgotten	1
all	1
about)	1
to	1
Teresa	1
Panza	1
his	1
wife	1
with	1
her	1
husband’s	1
letter	1
and	1
another	1
from	1
herself,	1
and	1
also	1
a	1
great	1
string	1
of	1
fine	1
coral	1
beads	1
as	1
a	1
present.	1
Now	1
the	1
history	1
says	1
this	1
page	1
was	1
very	1
sharp	1
and	1
quick-witted;	1
and	1
eager	1
to	1
serve	1
his	1
lord	1
and	1
lady	1
he	1
set	1
off	1
very	1
willingly	1
for	1
Sancho’s	1
village.	1
Before	1
he	1
entered	1
it	1
he	1
observed	1
a	1
number	1
of	1
women	1
washing	1
in	1
a	1
brook,	1
and	1
asked	1
them	1
if	1
they	1
could	1
tell	1
him	1
whether	1
there	1
lived	1
there	1
a	1
woman	1
of	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Teresa	1
Panza,	1
wife	1
of	1
one	1
Sancho	1
Panza,	1
squire	1
to	1
a	1
knight	1
called	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
of	1
La	1
Mancha.	1
At	1
the	1
question	1
a	1
young	1
girl	1
who	1
was	1
washing	1
stood	1
up	1
and	1
said,	1
“Teresa	1
Panza	1
is	1
my	1
mother,	1
and	1
that	1
Sancho	1
is	1
my	1
father,	1
and	1
that	1
knight	1
is	1
our	1
master.”	1
“Well	1
then,	1
miss,”	1
said	1
the	1
page,	1
“come	1
and	1
show	1
me	1
where	1
your	1
mother	1
is,	1
for	1
I	1
bring	1
her	1
a	1
letter	1
and	1
a	1
present	1
from	1
your	1
father.”	1
“That	1
I	1
will	1
with	1
all	1
my	1
heart,	1
señor,”	1
said	1
the	1
girl,	1
who	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
about	1
fourteen,	1
more	1
or	1
less;	1
and	1
leaving	1
the	1
clothes	1
she	1
was	1
washing	1
to	1
one	1
of	1
her	1
companions,	1
and	1
without	1
putting	1
anything	1
on	1
her	1
head	1
or	1
feet,	1
for	1
she	1
was	1
bare-legged	1
and	1
had	1
her	1
hair	1
hanging	1
about	1
her,	1
away	1
she	1
skipped	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
the	1
page’s	1
horse,	1
saying,	1
“Come,	1
your	1
worship,	1
our	1
house	1
is	1
at	1
the	1
entrance	1
of	1
the	1
town,	1
and	1
my	1
mother	1
is	1
there,	1
sorrowful	1
enough	1
at	1
not	1
having	1
had	1
any	1
news	1
of	1
my	1
father	1
this	1
ever	1
so	1
long.”	1
“Well,”	1
said	1
the	1
page,	1
“I	1
am	1
bringing	1
her	1
such	1
good	1
news	1
that	1
she	1
will	1
have	1
reason	1
to	1
thank	1
God.”	1
And	1
then,	1
skipping,	1
running,	1
and	1
capering,	1
the	1
girl	1
reached	1
the	1
town,	1
but	1
before	1
going	1
into	1
the	1
house	1
she	1
called	1
out	1
at	1
the	1
door,	1
“Come	1
out,	1
mother	1
Teresa,	1
come	1
out,	1
come	1
out;	1
here’s	1
a	1
gentleman	1
with	1
letters	1
and	1
other	1
things	1
from	1
my	1
good	1
father.”	1
At	1
these	1
words	1
her	1
mother	1
Teresa	1
Panza	1
came	1
out	1
spinning	1
a	1
bundle	1
of	1
flax,	1
in	1
a	1
grey	1
petticoat	1
(so	1
short	1
was	1
it	1
one	1
would	1
have	1
fancied	1
“they	1
to	1
her	1
shame	1
had	1
cut	1
it	1
short”),	1
a	1
grey	1
bodice	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
stuff,	1
and	1
a	1
smock.	1
She	1
was	1
not	1
very	1
old,	1
though	1
plainly	1
past	1
forty,	1
strong,	1
healthy,	1
vigorous,	1
and	1
sun-dried;	1
and	1
seeing	1
her	1
daughter	1
and	1
the	1
page	1
on	1
horseback,	1
she	1
exclaimed,	1
“What’s	1
this,	1
child?	1
What	1
gentleman	1
is	1
this?”	1
“A	1
servant	1
of	1
my	1
lady,	1
Doña	1
Teresa	1
Panza,”	1
replied	1
the	1
page;	1
and	1
suiting	1
the	1
action	1
to	1
the	1
word	1
he	1
flung	1
himself	1
off	1
his	1
horse,	1
and	1
with	1
great	1
humility	1
advanced	1
to	1
kneel	1
before	1
the	1
lady	1
Teresa,	1
saying,	1
“Let	1
me	1
kiss	1
your	1
hand,	1
Señora	1
Doña	1
Teresa,	1
as	1
the	1
lawful	1
and	1
only	1
wife	1
of	1
Señor	1
Don	1
Sancho	1
Panza,	1
rightful	1
governor	1
of	1
the	1
island	1
of	1
Barataria.”	1
“Ah,	1
señor,	1
get	1
up,	1
do	1
that,”	1
said	1
Teresa;	1
“for	1
I’m	1
not	1
a	1
bit	1
of	1
a	1
court	1
lady,	1
but	1
only	1
a	1
poor	1
country	1
woman,	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
a	1
clodcrusher,	1
and	1
the	1
wife	1
of	1
a	1
squire-errant	1
and	1
not	1
of	1
any	1
governor	1
at	1
all.”	1
“You	1
are,”	1
said	1
the	1
page,	1
“the	1
most	1
worthy	1
wife	1
of	1
a	1
most	1
arch-worthy	1
governor;	1
and	1
as	1
a	1
proof	1
of	1
what	1
I	1
say	1
accept	1
this	1
letter	1
and	1
this	1
present;”	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
he	1
took	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
pocket	1
a	1
string	1
of	1
coral	1
beads	1
with	1
gold	1
clasps,	1
and	1
placed	1
it	1
on	1
her	1
neck,	1
and	1
said,	1
“This	1
letter	1
is	1
from	1
his	1
lordship	1
the	1
governor,	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
these	1
coral	1
beads	1
from	1
my	1
lady	1
the	1
duchess,	1
who	1
sends	1
me	1
to	1
your	1
worship.”	1
Teresa	1
stood	1
lost	1
in	1
astonishment,	1
and	1
her	1
daughter	1
just	1
as	1
much,	1
and	1
the	1
girl	1
said,	1
“May	1
I	1
die	1
but	1
our	1
master	1
Don	1
Quixote’s	1
at	1
the	1
bottom	1
of	1
this;	1
he	1
must	1
have	1
given	1
father	1
the	1
government	1
or	1
county	1
he	1
so	1
often	1
promised	1
him.”	1
“That	1
is	1
the	1
truth,”	1
said	1
the	1
page;	1
“for	1
it	1
is	1
through	1
Señor	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
that	1
Señor	1
Sancho	1
is	1
now	1
governor	1
of	1
the	1
island	1
of	1
Barataria,	1
as	1
will	1
be	1
seen	1
by	1
this	1
letter.”	1
“Will	1
your	1
worship	1
read	1
it	1
to	1
me,	1
noble	1
sir?”	1
said	1
Teresa;	1
“for	1
though	1
I	1
can	1
spin	1
I	1
can’t	1
read,	1
not	1
a	1
scrap.”	1
“Nor	1
I	1
either,”	1
said	1
Sanchica;	1
“but	1
wait	1
a	1
bit,	1
and	1
I’ll	1
go	1
and	1
fetch	1
someone	1
who	1
can	1
read	1
it,	1
either	1
the	1
curate	1
himself	1
or	1
the	1
bachelor	1
Samson	1
Carrasco,	1
and	1
they’ll	1
come	1
gladly	1
to	1
hear	1
any	1
news	1
of	1
my	1
father.”	1
“There	1
is	1
no	1
need	1
to	1
fetch	1
anybody,”	1
said	1
the	1
page;	1
“for	1
though	1
I	1
can’t	1
spin	1
I	1
can	1
read,	1
and	1
I’ll	1
read	1
it;”	1
and	1
so	1
he	1
read	1
it	1
through,	1
but	1
as	1
it	1
has	1
been	1
already	1
given	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
inserted	1
here;	1
and	1
then	1
he	1
took	1
out	1
the	1
other	1
one	1
from	1
the	1
duchess,	1
which	1
ran	1
as	1
follows:	1
Friend	1
Teresa,—Your	1
husband	1
Sancho’s	1
good	1
qualities,	1
of	1
heart	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
of	1
head,	1
induced	1
and	1
compelled	1
me	1
to	1
request	1
my	1
husband	1
the	1
duke	1
to	1
give	1
him	1
the	1
government	1
of	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
many	1
islands.	1
I	1
am	1
told	1
he	1
governs	1
like	1
a	1
gerfalcon,	1
of	1
which	1
I	1
am	1
very	1
glad,	1
and	1
my	1
lord	1
the	1
duke,	1
of	1
course,	1
also;	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
very	1
thankful	1
to	1
heaven	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
made	1
a	1
mistake	1
in	1
choosing	1
him	1
for	1
that	1
same	1
government;	1
for	1
I	1
would	1
have	1
Señora	1
Teresa	1
know	1
that	1
a	1
good	1
governor	1
is	1
hard	1
to	1
find	1
in	1
this	1
world	1
and	1
may	1
God	1
make	1
me	1
as	1
good	1
as	1
Sancho’s	1
way	1
of	1
governing.	1
Herewith	1
I	1
send	1
you,	1
my	1
dear,	1
a	1
string	1
of	1
coral	1
beads	1
with	1
gold	1
clasps;	1
I	1
wish	1
they	1
were	1
Oriental	1
pearls;	1
but	1
“he	1
who	1
gives	1
thee	1
a	1
bone	1
does	1
not	1
wish	1
to	1
see	1
thee	1
dead;”	1
a	1
time	1
will	1
come	1
when	1
we	1
shall	1
become	1
acquainted	1
and	1
meet	1
one	1
another,	1
but	1
God	1
knows	1
the	1
future.	1
Commend	1
me	1
to	1
your	1
daughter	1
Sanchica,	1
and	1
tell	1
her	1
from	1
me	1
to	1
hold	1
herself	1
in	1
readiness,	1
for	1
I	1
mean	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
high	1
match	1
for	1
her	1
when	1
she	1
least	1
expects	1
it.	1
They	1
tell	1
me	1
there	1
are	1
big	1
acorns	1
in	1
your	1
village;	1
send	1
me	1
a	1
couple	1
of	1
dozen	1
or	1
so,	1
and	1
I	1
shall	1
value	1
them	1
greatly	1
as	1
coming	1
from	1
your	1
hand;	1
and	1
write	1
to	1
me	1
at	1
length	1
to	1
assure	1
me	1
of	1
your	1
health	1
and	1
well-being;	1
and	1
if	1
there	1
be	1
anything	1
you	1
stand	1
in	1
need	1
of,	1
it	1
is	1
but	1
to	1
open	1
your	1
mouth,	1
and	1
that	1
shall	1
be	1
the	1
measure;	1
and	1
so	1
God	1
keep	1
you.	1
From	1
this	1
place.	1
Your	1
loving	1
friend,	1
THE	1
DUCHESS.	1
“Ah,	1
what	1
a	1
good,	1
plain,	1
lowly	1
lady!”	1
said	1
Teresa	1
when	1
she	1
heard	1
the	1
letter;	1
“that	1
I	1
may	1
be	1
buried	1
with	1
ladies	1
of	1
that	1
sort,	1
and	1
not	1
the	1
gentlewomen	1
we	1
have	1
in	1
this	1
town,	1
that	1
fancy	1
because	1
they	1
are	1
gentlewomen	1
the	1
wind	1
must	1
not	1
touch	1
them,	1
and	1
go	1
to	1
church	1
with	1
as	1
much	1
airs	1
as	1
if	1
they	1
were	1
queens,	1
no	1
less,	1
and	1
seem	1
to	1
think	1
they	1
are	1
disgraced	1
if	1
they	1
look	1
at	1
a	1
farmer’s	1
wife!	1
And	1
see	1
here	1
how	1
this	1
good	1
lady,	1
for	1
all	1
she’s	1
a	1
duchess,	1
calls	1
me	1
‘friend,’	1
and	1
treats	1
me	1
as	1
if	1
I	1
was	1
her	1
equal—and	1
equal	1
may	1
I	1
see	1
her	1
with	1
the	1
tallest	1
church-tower	1
in	1
La	1
Mancha!	1
And	1
as	1
for	1
the	1
acorns,	1
señor,	1
I’ll	1
send	1
her	1
ladyship	1
a	1
peck	1
and	1
such	1
big	1
ones	1
that	1
one	1
might	1
come	1
to	1
see	1
them	1
as	1
a	1
show	1
and	1
a	1
wonder.	1
And	1
now,	1
Sanchica,	1
see	1
that	1
the	1
gentleman	1
is	1
comfortable;	1
put	1
up	1
his	1
horse,	1
and	1
get	1
some	1
eggs	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
stable,	1
and	1
cut	1
plenty	1
of	1
bacon,	1
and	1
let’s	1
give	1
him	1
his	1
dinner	1
like	1
a	1
prince;	1
for	1
the	1
good	1
news	1
he	1
has	1
brought,	1
and	1
his	1
own	1
bonny	1
face	1
deserve	1
it	1
all;	1
and	1
meanwhile	1
I’ll	1
run	1
out	1
and	1
give	1
the	1
neighbours	1
the	1
news	1
of	1
our	1
good	1
luck,	1
and	1
father	1
curate,	1
and	1
Master	1
Nicholas	1
the	1
barber,	1
who	1
are	1
and	1
always	1
have	1
been	1
such	1
friends	1
of	1
thy	1
father’s.”	1
“That	1
I	1
will,	1
mother,”	1
said	1
Sanchica;	1
“but	1
mind,	1
you	1
must	1
give	1
me	1
half	1
of	1
that	1
string;	1
for	1
I	1
don’t	1
think	1
my	1
lady	1
the	1
duchess	1
could	1
have	1
been	1
so	1
stupid	1
as	1
to	1
send	1
it	1
all	1
to	1
you.”	1
“It	1
is	1
all	1
for	1
thee,	1
my	1
child,”	1
said	1
Teresa;	1
“but	1
let	1
me	1
wear	1
it	1
round	1
my	1
neck	1
for	1
a	1
few	1
days;	1
for	1
verily	1
it	1
seems	1
to	1
make	1
my	1
heart	1
glad.”	1
“You	1
will	1
be	1
glad	1
too,”	1
said	1
the	1
page,	1
“when	1
you	1
see	1
the	1
bundle	1
there	1
is	1
in	1
this	1
portmanteau,	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
suit	1
of	1
the	1
finest	1
cloth,	1
that	1
the	1
governor	1
only	1
wore	1
one	1
day	1
out	1
hunting	1
and	1
now	1
sends,	1
all	1
for	1
Señora	1
Sanchica.”	1
“May	1
he	1
live	1
a	1
thousand	1
years,”	1
said	1
Sanchica,	1
“and	1
the	1
bearer	1
as	1
many,	1
nay	1
two	1
thousand,	1
if	1
needful.”	1
With	1
this	1
Teresa	1
hurried	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
with	1
the	1
letters,	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
string	1
of	1
beads	1
round	1
her	1
neck,	1
and	1
went	1
along	1
thrumming	1
the	1
letters	1
as	1
if	1
they	1
were	1
a	1
tambourine,	1
and	1
by	1
chance	1
coming	1
across	1
the	1
curate	1
and	1
Samson	1
Carrasco	1
she	1
began	1
capering	1
and	1
saying,	1
“None	1
of	1
us	1
poor	1
now,	1
faith!	1
We’ve	1
got	1
a	1
little	1
government!	1
Ay,	1
let	1
the	1
finest	1
fine	1
lady	1
tackle	1
me,	1
and	1
I’ll	1
give	1
her	1
a	1
setting	1
down!”	1
“What’s	1
all	1
this,	1
Teresa	1
Panza,”	1
said	1
they;	1
“what	1
madness	1
is	1
this,	1
and	1
what	1
papers	1
are	1
those?”	1
“The	1
madness	1
is	1
only	1
this,”	1
said	1
she,	1
“that	1
these	1
are	1
the	1
letters	1
of	1
duchesses	1
and	1
governors,	1
and	1
these	1
I	1
have	1
on	1
my	1
neck	1
are	1
fine	1
coral	1
beads,	1
with	1
ave-marias	1
and	1
paternosters	1
of	1
beaten	1
gold,	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
governess.”	1
“God	1
help	1
us,”	1
said	1
the	1
curate,	1
“we	1
don’t	1
understand	1
you,	1
Teresa,	1
or	1
know	1
what	1
you	1
are	1
talking	1
about.”	1
“There,	1
you	1
may	1
see	1
it	1
yourselves,”	1
said	1
Teresa,	1
and	1
she	1
handed	1
them	1
the	1
letters.	1
The	1
curate	1
read	1
them	1
out	1
for	1
Samson	1
Carrasco	1
to	1
hear,	1
and	1
Samson	1
and	1
he	1
regarded	1
one	1
another	1
with	1
looks	1
of	1
astonishment	1
at	1
what	1
they	1
had	1
read,	1
and	1
the	1
bachelor	1
asked	1
who	1
had	1
brought	1
the	1
letters.	1
Teresa	1
in	1
reply	1
bade	1
them	1
come	1
with	1
her	1
to	1
her	1
house	1
and	1
they	1
would	1
see	1
the	1
messenger,	1
a	1
most	1
elegant	1
youth,	1
who	1
had	1
brought	1
another	1
present	1
which	1
was	1
worth	1
as	1
much	1
more.	1
The	1
curate	1
took	1
the	1
coral	1
beads	1
from	1
her	1
neck	1
and	1
examined	1
them	1
again	1
and	1
again,	1
and	1
having	1
satisfied	1
himself	1
as	1
to	1
their	1
fineness	1
he	1
fell	1
to	1
wondering	1
afresh,	1
and	1
said,	1
“By	1
the	1
gown	1
I	1
wear	1
I	1
don’t	1
know	1
what	1
to	1
say	1
or	1
think	1
of	1
these	1
letters	1
and	1
presents;	1
on	1
the	1
one	1
hand	1
I	1
can	1
see	1
and	1
feel	1
the	1
fineness	1
of	1
these	1
coral	1
beads,	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
I	1
read	1
how	1
a	1
duchess	1
sends	1
to	1
beg	1
for	1
a	1
couple	1
of	1
dozen	1
of	1
acorns.”	1
“Square	1
that	1
if	1
you	1
can,”	1
said	1
Carrasco;	1
“well,	1
let’s	1
go	1
and	1
see	1
the	1
messenger,	1
and	1
from	1
him	1
we’ll	1
learn	1
something	1
about	1
this	1
mystery	1
that	1
has	1
turned	1
up.”	1
They	1
did	1
so,	1
and	1
Teresa	1
returned	1
with	1
them.	1
They	1
found	1
the	1
page	1
sifting	1
a	1
little	1
barley	1
for	1
his	1
horse,	1
and	1
Sanchica	1
cutting	1
a	1
rasher	1
of	1
bacon	1
to	1
be	1
paved	1
with	1
eggs	1
for	1
his	1
dinner.	1
His	1
looks	1
and	1
his	1
handsome	1
apparel	1
pleased	1
them	1
both	1
greatly;	1
and	1
after	1
they	1
had	1
saluted	1
him	1
courteously,	1
and	1
he	1
them,	1
Samson	1
begged	1
him	1
to	1
give	1
them	1
his	1
news,	1
as	1
well	1
of	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
as	1
of	1
Sancho	1
Panza,	1
for,	1
he	1
said,	1
though	1
they	1
had	1
read	1
the	1
letters	1
from	1
Sancho	1
and	1
her	1
ladyship	1
the	1
duchess,	1
they	1
were	1
still	1
puzzled	1
and	1
could	1
not	1
make	1
out	1
what	1
was	1
meant	1
by	1
Sancho’s	1
government,	1
and	1
above	1
all	1
of	1
an	1
island,	1
when	1
all	1
or	1
most	1
of	1
those	1
in	1
the	1
Mediterranean	1
belonged	1
to	1
his	1
Majesty.	1
To	1
this	1
the	1
page	1
replied,	1
“As	1
to	1
Señor	1
Sancho	1
Panza’s	1
being	1
a	1
governor	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
doubt	1
whatever;	1
but	1
whether	1
it	1
is	1
an	1
island	1
or	1
not	1
that	1
he	1
governs,	1
with	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
nothing	1
to	1
do;	1
suffice	1
it	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
town	1
of	1
more	1
than	1
a	1
thousand	1
inhabitants;	1
with	1
regard	1
to	1
the	1
acorns	1
I	1
may	1
tell	1
you	1
my	1
lady	1
the	1
duchess	1
is	1
so	1
unpretending	1
and	1
unassuming	1
that,	1
not	1
to	1
speak	1
of	1
sending	1
to	1
beg	1
for	1
acorns	1
from	1
a	1
peasant	1
woman,	1
she	1
has	1
been	1
known	1
to	1
send	1
to	1
ask	1
for	1
the	1
loan	1
of	1
a	1
comb	1
from	1
one	1
of	1
her	1
neighbours;	1
for	1
I	1
would	1
have	1
your	1
worships	1
know	1
that	1
the	1
ladies	1
of	1
Aragon,	1
though	1
they	1
are	1
just	1
as	1
illustrious,	1
are	1
not	1
so	1
punctilious	1
and	1
haughty	1
as	1
the	1
Castilian	1
ladies;	1
they	1
treat	1
people	1
with	1
greater	1
familiarity.”	1
In	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
this	1
conversation	1
Sanchica	1
came	1
in	1
with	1
her	1
skirt	1
full	1
of	1
eggs,	1
and	1
said	1
she	1
to	1
the	1
page,	1
“Tell	1
me,	1
señor,	1
does	1
my	1
father	1
wear	1
trunk-hose	1
since	1
he	1
has	1
been	1
governor?”	1
“I	1
have	1
not	1
noticed,”	1
said	1
the	1
page;	1
“but	1
no	1
doubt	1
he	1
wears	1
them.”	1
“Ah!	1
my	1
God!”	1
said	1
Sanchica,	1
“what	1
a	1
sight	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
to	1
see	1
my	1
father	1
in	1
tights!	1
Isn’t	1
it	1
odd	1
that	1
ever	1
since	1
I	1
was	1
born	1
I	1
have	1
had	1
a	1
longing	1
to	1
see	1
my	1
father	1
in	1
trunk-hose?”	1
“As	1
things	1
go	1
you	1
will	1
see	1
that	1
if	1
you	1
live,”	1
said	1
the	1
page;	1
“by	1
God	1
he	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
to	1
take	1
the	1
road	1
with	1
a	1
sunshade	1
if	1
the	1
government	1
only	1
lasts	1
him	1
two	1
months	1
more.”	1
The	1
curate	1
and	1
the	1
bachelor	1
could	1
see	1
plainly	1
enough	1
that	1
the	1
page	1
spoke	1
in	1
a	1
waggish	1
vein;	1
but	1
the	1
fineness	1
of	1
the	1
coral	1
beads,	1
and	1
the	1
hunting	1
suit	1
that	1
Sancho	1
sent	1
(for	1
Teresa	1
had	1
already	1
shown	1
it	1
to	1
them)	1
did	1
away	1
with	1
the	1
impression;	1
and	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
laughing	1
at	1
Sanchica’s	1
wish,	1
and	1
still	1
more	1
when	1
Teresa	1
said,	1
“Señor	1
curate,	1
look	1
about	1
if	1
there’s	1
anybody	1
here	1
going	1
to	1
Madrid	1
or	1
Toledo,	1
to	1
buy	1
me	1
a	1
hooped	1
petticoat,	1
a	1
proper	1
fashionable	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
best	1
quality;	1
for	1
indeed	1
and	1
indeed	1
I	1
must	1
do	1
honour	1
to	1
my	1
husband’s	1
government	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
I	1
can;	1
nay,	1
if	1
I	1
am	1
put	1
to	1
it	1
and	1
have	1
to,	1
I’ll	1
go	1
to	1
Court	1
and	1
set	1
a	1
coach	1
like	1
all	1
the	1
world;	1
for	1
she	1
who	1
has	1
a	1
governor	1
for	1
her	1
husband	1
may	1
very	1
well	1
have	1
one	1
and	1
keep	1
one.”	1
“And	1
why	1
not,	1
mother!”	1
said	1
Sanchica;	1
“would	1
to	1
God	1
it	1
were	1
to-day	1
instead	1
of	1
to-morrow,	1
even	1
though	1
they	1
were	1
to	1
say	1
when	1
they	1
saw	1
me	1
seated	1
in	1
the	1
coach	1
with	1
my	1
mother,	1
‘See	1
that	1
rubbish,	1
that	1
garlic-stuffed	1
fellow’s	1
daughter,	1
how	1
she	1
goes	1
stretched	1
at	1
her	1
ease	1
in	1
a	1
coach	1
as	1
if	1
she	1
was	1
a	1
she-pope!’	1
But	1
let	1
them	1
tramp	1
through	1
the	1
mud,	1
and	1
let	1
me	1
go	1
in	1
my	1
coach	1
with	1
my	1
feet	1
off	1
the	1
ground.	1
Bad	1
luck	1
to	1
backbiters	1
all	1
over	1
the	1
world;	1
‘let	1
me	1
go	1
warm	1
and	1
the	1
people	1
may	1
laugh.’	1
Do	1
I	1
say	1
right,	1
mother?”	1
“To	1
be	1
sure	1
you	1
do,	1
my	1
child,”	1
said	1
Teresa;	1
“and	1
all	1
this	1
good	1
luck,	1
and	1
even	1
more,	1
my	1
good	1
Sancho	1
foretold	1
me;	1
and	1
thou	1
wilt	1
see,	1
my	1
daughter,	1
he	1
won’t	1
stop	1
till	1
he	1
has	1
made	1
me	1
a	1
countess;	1
for	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
beginning	1
is	1
everything	1
in	1
luck;	1
and	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
heard	1
thy	1
good	1
father	1
say	1
many	1
a	1
time	1
(for	1
besides	1
being	1
thy	1
father	1
he’s	1
the	1
father	1
of	1
proverbs	1
too),	1
‘When	1
they	1
offer	1
thee	1
a	1
heifer,	1
run	1
with	1
a	1
halter;	1
when	1
they	1
offer	1
thee	1
a	1
government,	1
take	1
it;	1
when	1
they	1
would	1
give	1
thee	1
a	1
county,	1
seize	1
it;	1
when	1
they	1
say,	1
“Here,	1
here!”	1
to	1
thee	1
with	1
something	1
good,	1
swallow	1
it.’	1
Oh	1
no!	1
go	1
to	1
sleep,	1
and	1
don’t	1
answer	1
the	1
strokes	1
of	1
good	1
fortune	1
and	1
the	1
lucky	1
chances	1
that	1
are	1
knocking	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
your	1
house!”	1
“And	1
what	1
do	1
I	1
care,”	1
added	1
Sanchica,	1
“whether	1
anybody	1
says	1
when	1
he	1
sees	1
me	1
holding	1
my	1
head	1
up,	1
‘The	1
dog	1
saw	1
himself	1
in	1
hempen	1
breeches,’	1
and	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
it?”	1
Hearing	1
this	1
the	1
curate	1
said,	1
“I	1
do	1
believe	1
that	1
all	1
this	1
family	1
of	1
the	1
Panzas	1
are	1
born	1
with	1
a	1
sackful	1
of	1
proverbs	1
in	1
their	1
insides,	1
every	1
one	1
of	1
them;	1
I	1
never	1
saw	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
does	1
not	1
pour	1
them	1
out	1
at	1
all	1
times	1
and	1
on	1
all	1
occasions.”	1
“That	1
is	1
true,”	1
said	1
the	1
page,	1
“for	1
Señor	1
Governor	1
Sancho	1
utters	1
them	1
at	1
every	1
turn;	1
and	1
though	1
a	1
great	1
many	1
of	1
them	1
are	1
not	1
to	1
the	1
purpose,	1
still	1
they	1
amuse	1
one,	1
and	1
my	1
lady	1
the	1
duchess	1
and	1
the	1
duke	1
praise	1
them	1
highly.”	1
“Then	1
you	1
still	1
maintain	1
that	1
all	1
this	1
about	1
Sancho’s	1
government	1
is	1
true,	1
señor,”	1
said	1
the	1
bachelor,	1
“and	1
that	1
there	1
actually	1
is	1
a	1
duchess	1
who	1
sends	1
him	1
presents	1
and	1
writes	1
to	1
him?	1
Because	1
we,	1
although	1
we	1
have	1
handled	1
the	1
present	1
and	1
read	1
the	1
letters,	1
don’t	1
believe	1
it	1
and	1
suspect	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
something	1
in	1
the	1
line	1
of	1
our	1
fellow-townsman	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
who	1
fancies	1
that	1
everything	1
is	1
done	1
by	1
enchantment;	1
and	1
for	1
this	1
reason	1
I	1
am	1
almost	1
ready	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
I’d	1
like	1
to	1
touch	1
and	1
feel	1
your	1
worship	1
to	1
see	1
whether	1
you	1
are	1
a	1
mere	1
ambassador	1
of	1
the	1
imagination	1
or	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
flesh	1
and	1
blood.”	1
“All	1
I	1
know,	1
sirs,”	1
replied	1
the	1
page,	1
“is	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
real	1
ambassador,	1
and	1
that	1
Señor	1
Sancho	1
Panza	1
is	1
governor	1
as	1
a	1
matter	1
of	1
fact,	1
and	1
that	1
my	1
lord	1
and	1
lady	1
the	1
duke	1
and	1
duchess	1
can	1
give,	1
and	1
have	1
given	1
him	1
this	1
same	1
government,	1
and	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
heard	1
it	1
said	1
Sancho	1
Panza	1
bears	1
himself	1
very	1
stoutly	1
therein;	1
whether	1
there	1
be	1
any	1
enchantment	1
in	1
all	1
this	1
or	1
not,	1
it	1
is	1
for	1
your	1
worships	1
to	1
settle	1
between	1
you;	1
for	1
that’s	1
all	1
I	1
know	1
by	1
the	1
oath	1
I	1
swear,	1
and	1
that	1
is	1
by	1
the	1
life	1
of	1
my	1
parents	1
whom	1
I	1
have	1
still	1
alive,	1
and	1
love	1
dearly.”	1
“It	1
may	1
be	1
so,”	1
said	1
the	1
bachelor;	1
“but	1
_dubitat	1
Augustinus_.”	1
“Doubt	1
who	1
will,”	1
said	1
the	1
page;	1
“what	1
I	1
have	1
told	1
you	1
is	1
the	1
truth,	1
and	1
that	1
will	1
always	1
rise	1
above	1
falsehood	1
as	1
oil	1
above	1
water;	1
if	1
not	1
_operibus	1
credite,	1
et	1
non	1
verbis_.	1
Let	1
one	1
of	1
you	1
come	1
with	1
me,	1
and	1
he	1
will	1
see	1
with	1
his	1
eyes	1
what	1
he	1
does	1
not	1
believe	1
with	1
his	1
ears.”	1
“It’s	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
make	1
that	1
trip,”	1
said	1
Sanchica;	1
“take	1
me	1
with	1
you,	1
señor,	1
behind	1
you	1
on	1
your	1
horse;	1
for	1
I’ll	1
go	1
with	1
all	1
my	1
heart	1
to	1
see	1
my	1
father.”	1
“Governors’	1
daughters,”	1
said	1
the	1
page,	1
“must	1
not	1
travel	1
along	1
the	1
roads	1
alone,	1
but	1
accompanied	1
by	1
coaches	1
and	1
litters	1
and	1
a	1
great	1
number	1
of	1
attendants.”	1
“By	1
God,”	1
said	1
Sanchica,	1
“I	1
can	1
go	1
just	1
as	1
well	1
mounted	1
on	1
a	1
she-ass	1
as	1
in	1
a	1
coach;	1
what	1
a	1
dainty	1
lass	1
you	1
must	1
take	1
me	1
for!”	1
“Hush,	1
girl,”	1
said	1
Teresa;	1
“you	1
don’t	1
know	1
what	1
you’re	1
talking	1
about;	1
the	1
gentleman	1
is	1
quite	1
right,	1
for	1
‘as	1
the	1
time	1
so	1
the	1
behaviour;’	1
when	1
it	1
was	1
Sancho	1
it	1
was	1
‘Sancha;’	1
when	1
it	1
is	1
governor	1
it’s	1
‘señora;’	1
I	1
don’t	1
know	1
if	1
I’m	1
right.”	1
“Señora	1
Teresa	1
says	1
more	1
than	1
she	1
is	1
aware	1
of,”	1
said	1
the	1
page;	1
“and	1
now	1
give	1
me	1
something	1
to	1
eat	1
and	1
let	1
me	1
go	1
at	1
once,	1
for	1
I	1
mean	1
to	1
return	1
this	1
evening.”	1
“Come	1
and	1
do	1
penance	1
with	1
me,”	1
said	1
the	1
curate	1
at	1
this;	1
“for	1
Señora	1
Teresa	1
has	1
more	1
will	1
than	1
means	1
to	1
serve	1
so	1
worthy	1
a	1
guest.”	1
The	1
page	1
refused,	1
but	1
had	1
to	1
consent	1
at	1
last	1
for	1
his	1
own	1
sake;	1
and	1
the	1
curate	1
took	1
him	1
home	1
with	1
him	1
very	1
gladly,	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
have	1
an	1
opportunity	1
of	1
questioning	1
him	1
at	1
leisure	1
about	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
and	1
his	1
doings.	1
The	1
bachelor	1
offered	1
to	1
write	1
the	1
letters	1
in	1
reply	1
for	1
Teresa;	1
but	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
care	1
to	1
let	1
him	1
mix	1
himself	1
up	1
in	1
her	1
affairs,	1
for	1
she	1
thought	1
him	1
somewhat	1
given	1
to	1
joking;	1
and	1
so	1
she	1
gave	1
a	1
cake	1
and	1
a	1
couple	1
of	1
eggs	1
to	1
a	1
young	1
acolyte	1
who	1
was	1
a	1
penman,	1
and	1
he	1
wrote	1
for	1
her	1
two	1
letters,	1
one	1
for	1
her	1
husband	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
for	1
the	1
duchess,	1
dictated	1
out	1
of	1
her	1
own	1
head,	1
which	1
are	1
not	1
the	1
worst	1
inserted	1
in	1
this	1
great	1
history,	1
as	1
will	1
be	1
seen	1
farther	1
on.	1

Day	1
came	1
after	1
the	1
night	1
of	1
the	1
governor’s	1
round;	1
a	1
night	1
which	1
the	1
head-carver	1
passed	1
without	1
sleeping,	1
so	1
were	1
his	1
thoughts	1
of	1
the	1
face	1
and	1
air	1
and	1
beauty	1
of	1
the	1
disguised	1
damsel,	1
while	1
the	1
majordomo	1
spent	1
what	1
was	1
left	1
of	1
it	1
in	1
writing	1
an	1
account	1
to	1
his	1
lord	1
and	1
lady	1
of	1
all	1
Sancho	1
said	1
and	1
did,	1
being	1
as	1
much	1
amazed	1
at	1
his	1
sayings	1
as	1
at	1
his	1
doings,	1
for	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
mixture	1
of	1
shrewdness	1
and	1
simplicity	1
in	1
all	1
his	1
words	1
and	1
deeds.	1
The	1
señor	1
governor	1
got	1
up,	1
and	1
by	1
Doctor	1
Pedro	1
Recio’s	1
directions	1
they	1
made	1
him	1
break	1
his	1
fast	1
on	1
a	1
little	1
conserve	1
and	1
four	1
sups	1
of	1
cold	1
water,	1
which	1
Sancho	1
would	1
have	1
readily	1
exchanged	1
for	1
a	1
piece	1
of	1
bread	1
and	1
a	1
bunch	1
of	1
grapes;	1
but	1
seeing	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
help	1
for	1
it,	1
he	1
submitted	1
with	1
no	1
little	1
sorrow	1
of	1
heart	1
and	1
discomfort	1
of	1
stomach;	1
Pedro	1
Recio	1
having	1
persuaded	1
him	1
that	1
light	1
and	1
delicate	1
diet	1
enlivened	1
the	1
wits,	1
and	1
that	1
was	1
what	1
was	1
most	1
essential	1
for	1
persons	1
placed	1
in	1
command	1
and	1
in	1
responsible	1
situations,	1
where	1
they	1
have	1
to	1
employ	1
not	1
only	1
the	1
bodily	1
powers	1
but	1
those	1
of	1
the	1
mind	1
also.	1
By	1
means	1
of	1
this	1
sophistry	1
Sancho	1
was	1
made	1
to	1
endure	1
hunger,	1
and	1
hunger	1
so	1
keen	1
that	1
in	1
his	1
heart	1
he	1
cursed	1
the	1
government,	1
and	1
even	1
him	1
who	1
had	1
given	1
it	1
to	1
him;	1
however,	1
with	1
his	1
hunger	1
and	1
his	1
conserve	1
he	1
undertook	1
to	1
deliver	1
judgments	1
that	1
day,	1
and	1
the	1
first	1
thing	1
that	1
came	1
before	1
him	1
was	1
a	1
question	1
that	1
was	1
submitted	1
to	1
him	1
by	1
a	1
stranger,	1
in	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
the	1
majordomo	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
attendants,	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
in	1
these	1
words:	1
“Señor,	1
a	1
large	1
river	1
separated	1
two	1
districts	1
of	1
one	1
and	1
the	1
same	1
lordship—will	1
your	1
worship	1
please	1
to	1
pay	1
attention,	1
for	1
the	1
case	1
is	1
an	1
important	1
and	1
a	1
rather	1
knotty	1
one?	1
Well	1
then,	1
on	1
this	1
river	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
bridge,	1
and	1
at	1
one	1
end	1
of	1
it	1
a	1
gallows,	1
and	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
tribunal,	1
where	1
four	1
judges	1
commonly	1
sat	1
to	1
administer	1
the	1
law	1
which	1
the	1
lord	1
of	1
river,	1
bridge	1
and	1
the	1
lordship	1
had	1
enacted,	1
and	1
which	1
was	1
to	1
this	1
effect,	1
‘If	1
anyone	1
crosses	1
by	1
this	1
bridge	1
from	1
one	1
side	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
he	1
shall	1
declare	1
on	1
oath	1
where	1
he	1
is	1
going	1
to	1
and	1
with	1
what	1
object;	1
and	1
if	1
he	1
swears	1
truly,	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
allowed	1
to	1
pass,	1
but	1
if	1
falsely,	1
he	1
shall	1
be	1
put	1
to	1
death	1
for	1
it	1
by	1
hanging	1
on	1
the	1
gallows	1
erected	1
there,	1
without	1
any	1
remission.’	1
Though	1
the	1
law	1
and	1
its	1
severe	1
penalty	1
were	1
known,	1
many	1
persons	1
crossed,	1
but	1
in	1
their	1
declarations	1
it	1
was	1
easy	1
to	1
see	1
at	1
once	1
they	1
were	1
telling	1
the	1
truth,	1
and	1
the	1
judges	1
let	1
them	1
pass	1
free.	1
It	1
happened,	1
however,	1
that	1
one	1
man,	1
when	1
they	1
came	1
to	1
take	1
his	1
declaration,	1
swore	1
and	1
said	1
that	1
by	1
the	1
oath	1
he	1
took	1
he	1
was	1
going	1
to	1
die	1
upon	1
that	1
gallows	1
that	1
stood	1
there,	1
and	1
nothing	1
else.	1
The	1
judges	1
held	1
a	1
consultation	1
over	1
the	1
oath,	1
and	1
they	1
said,	1
‘If	1
we	1
let	1
this	1
man	1
pass	1
free	1
he	1
has	1
sworn	1
falsely,	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
law	1
he	1
ought	1
to	1
die;	1
but	1
if	1
we	1
hang	1
him,	1
as	1
he	1
swore	1
he	1
was	1
going	1
to	1
die	1
on	1
that	1
gallows,	1
and	1
therefore	1
swore	1
the	1
truth,	1
by	1
the	1
same	1
law	1
he	1
ought	1
to	1
go	1
free.’	1
It	1
is	1
asked	1
of	1
your	1
worship,	1
señor	1
governor,	1
what	1
are	1
the	1
judges	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
this	1
man?	1
For	1
they	1
are	1
still	1
in	1
doubt	1
and	1
perplexity;	1
and	1
having	1
heard	1
of	1
your	1
worship’s	1
acute	1
and	1
exalted	1
intellect,	1
they	1
have	1
sent	1
me	1
to	1
entreat	1
your	1
worship	1
on	1
their	1
behalf	1
to	1
give	1
your	1
opinion	1
on	1
this	1
very	1
intricate	1
and	1
puzzling	1
case.”	1
To	1
this	1
Sancho	1
made	1
answer,	1
“Indeed	1
those	1
gentlemen	1
the	1
judges	1
that	1
send	1
you	1
to	1
me	1
might	1
have	1
spared	1
themselves	1
the	1
trouble,	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
more	1
of	1
the	1
obtuse	1
than	1
the	1
acute	1
in	1
me;	1
but	1
repeat	1
the	1
case	1
over	1
again,	1
so	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
understand	1
it,	1
and	1
then	1
perhaps	1
I	1
may	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
hit	1
the	1
point.”	1
The	1
querist	1
repeated	1
again	1
and	1
again	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
said	1
before,	1
and	1
then	1
Sancho	1
said,	1
“It	1
seems	1
to	1
me	1
I	1
can	1
set	1
the	1
matter	1
right	1
in	1
a	1
moment,	1
and	1
in	1
this	1
way;	1
the	1
man	1
swears	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
going	1
to	1
die	1
upon	1
the	1
gallows;	1
but	1
if	1
he	1
dies	1
upon	1
it,	1
he	1
has	1
sworn	1
the	1
truth,	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
law	1
enacted	1
deserves	1
to	1
go	1
free	1
and	1
pass	1
over	1
the	1
bridge;	1
but	1
if	1
they	1
don’t	1
hang	1
him,	1
then	1
he	1
has	1
sworn	1
falsely,	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
same	1
law	1
deserves	1
to	1
be	1
hanged.”	1
“It	1
is	1
as	1
the	1
señor	1
governor	1
says,”	1
said	1
the	1
messenger;	1
“and	1
as	1
regards	1
a	1
complete	1
comprehension	1
of	1
the	1
case,	1
there	1
is	1
nothing	1
left	1
to	1
desire	1
or	1
hesitate	1
about.”	1
“Well	1
then	1
I	1
say,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“that	1
of	1
this	1
man	1
they	1
should	1
let	1
pass	1
the	1
part	1
that	1
has	1
sworn	1
truly,	1
and	1
hang	1
the	1
part	1
that	1
has	1
lied;	1
and	1
in	1
this	1
way	1
the	1
conditions	1
of	1
the	1
passage	1
will	1
be	1
fully	1
complied	1
with.”	1
“But	1
then,	1
señor	1
governor,”	1
replied	1
the	1
querist,	1
“the	1
man	1
will	1
have	1
to	1
be	1
divided	1
into	1
two	1
parts;	1
and	1
if	1
he	1
is	1
divided	1
of	1
course	1
he	1
will	1
die;	1
and	1
so	1
none	1
of	1
the	1
requirements	1
of	1
the	1
law	1
will	1
be	1
carried	1
out,	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
absolutely	1
necessary	1
to	1
comply	1
with	1
it.”	1
“Look	1
here,	1
my	1
good	1
sir,”	1
said	1
Sancho;	1
“either	1
I’m	1
a	1
numskull	1
or	1
else	1
there	1
is	1
the	1
same	1
reason	1
for	1
this	1
passenger	1
dying	1
as	1
for	1
his	1
living	1
and	1
passing	1
over	1
the	1
bridge;	1
for	1
if	1
the	1
truth	1
saves	1
him	1
the	1
falsehood	1
equally	1
condemns	1
him;	1
and	1
that	1
being	1
the	1
case	1
it	1
is	1
my	1
opinion	1
you	1
should	1
say	1
to	1
the	1
gentlemen	1
who	1
sent	1
you	1
to	1
me	1
that	1
as	1
the	1
arguments	1
for	1
condemning	1
him	1
and	1
for	1
absolving	1
him	1
are	1
exactly	1
balanced,	1
they	1
should	1
let	1
him	1
pass	1
freely,	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
always	1
more	1
praiseworthy	1
to	1
do	1
good	1
than	1
to	1
do	1
evil;	1
this	1
I	1
would	1
give	1
signed	1
with	1
my	1
name	1
if	1
I	1
knew	1
how	1
to	1
sign;	1
and	1
what	1
I	1
have	1
said	1
in	1
this	1
case	1
is	1
not	1
out	1
of	1
my	1
own	1
head,	1
but	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
many	1
precepts	1
my	1
master	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
gave	1
me	1
the	1
night	1
before	1
I	1
left	1
to	1
become	1
governor	1
of	1
this	1
island,	1
that	1
came	1
into	1
my	1
mind,	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
this,	1
that	1
when	1
there	1
was	1
any	1
doubt	1
about	1
the	1
justice	1
of	1
a	1
case	1
I	1
should	1
lean	1
to	1
mercy;	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
God’s	1
will	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
recollect	1
it	1
now,	1
for	1
it	1
fits	1
this	1
case	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
was	1
made	1
for	1
it.”	1
“That	1
is	1
true,”	1
said	1
the	1
majordomo;	1
“and	1
I	1
maintain	1
that	1
Lycurgus	1
himself,	1
who	1
gave	1
laws	1
to	1
the	1
Lacedemonians,	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
pronounced	1
a	1
better	1
decision	1
than	1
the	1
great	1
Panza	1
has	1
given;	1
let	1
the	1
morning’s	1
audience	1
close	1
with	1
this,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
see	1
that	1
the	1
señor	1
governor	1
has	1
dinner	1
entirely	1
to	1
his	1
liking.”	1
“That’s	1
all	1
I	1
ask	1
for—fair	1
play,”	1
said	1
Sancho;	1
“give	1
me	1
my	1
dinner,	1
and	1
then	1
let	1
it	1
rain	1
cases	1
and	1
questions	1
on	1
me,	1
and	1
I’ll	1
despatch	1
them	1
in	1
a	1
twinkling.”	1
The	1
majordomo	1
kept	1
his	1
word,	1
for	1
he	1
felt	1
it	1
against	1
his	1
conscience	1
to	1
kill	1
so	1
wise	1
a	1
governor	1
by	1
hunger;	1
particularly	1
as	1
he	1
intended	1
to	1
have	1
done	1
with	1
him	1
that	1
same	1
night,	1
playing	1
off	1
the	1
last	1
joke	1
he	1
was	1
commissioned	1
to	1
practise	1
upon	1
him.	1
It	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
then,	1
that	1
after	1
he	1
had	1
dined	1
that	1
day,	1
in	1
opposition	1
to	1
the	1
rules	1
and	1
aphorisms	1
of	1
Doctor	1
Tirteafuera,	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
taking	1
away	1
the	1
cloth	1
there	1
came	1
a	1
courier	1
with	1
a	1
letter	1
from	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
for	1
the	1
governor.	1
Sancho	1
ordered	1
the	1
secretary	1
to	1
read	1
it	1
to	1
himself,	1
and	1
if	1
there	1
was	1
nothing	1
in	1
it	1
that	1
demanded	1
secrecy	1
to	1
read	1
it	1
aloud.	1
The	1
secretary	1
did	1
so,	1
and	1
after	1
he	1
had	1
skimmed	1
the	1
contents	1
he	1
said,	1
“It	1
may	1
well	1
be	1
read	1
aloud,	1
for	1
what	1
Señor	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
writes	1
to	1
your	1
worship	1
deserves	1
to	1
be	1
printed	1
or	1
written	1
in	1
letters	1
of	1
gold,	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
as	1
follows.”	1
DON	1
QUIXOTE	1
OF	1
LA	1
MANCHA’S	1
LETTER	1
TO	1
SANCHO	1
PANZA,	1
GOVERNOR	1
OF	1
THE	1
ISLAND	1
OF	1
BARATARIA.	1
When	1
I	1
was	1
expecting	1
to	1
hear	1
of	1
thy	1
stupidities	1
and	1
blunders,	1
friend	1
Sancho,	1
I	1
have	1
received	1
intelligence	1
of	1
thy	1
displays	1
of	1
good	1
sense,	1
for	1
which	1
I	1
give	1
special	1
thanks	1
to	1
heaven	1
that	1
can	1
raise	1
the	1
poor	1
from	1
the	1
dunghill	1
and	1
of	1
fools	1
to	1
make	1
wise	1
men.	1
They	1
tell	1
me	1
thou	1
dost	1
govern	1
as	1
if	1
thou	1
wert	1
a	1
man,	1
and	1
art	1
a	1
man	1
as	1
if	1
thou	1
wert	1
a	1
beast,	1
so	1
great	1
is	1
the	1
humility	1
wherewith	1
thou	1
dost	1
comport	1
thyself.	1
But	1
I	1
would	1
have	1
thee	1
bear	1
in	1
mind,	1
Sancho,	1
that	1
very	1
often	1
it	1
is	1
fitting	1
and	1
necessary	1
for	1
the	1
authority	1
of	1
office	1
to	1
resist	1
the	1
humility	1
of	1
the	1
heart;	1
for	1
the	1
seemly	1
array	1
of	1
one	1
who	1
is	1
invested	1
with	1
grave	1
duties	1
should	1
be	1
such	1
as	1
they	1
require	1
and	1
not	1
measured	1
by	1
what	1
his	1
own	1
humble	1
tastes	1
may	1
lead	1
him	1
to	1
prefer.	1
Dress	1
well;	1
a	1
stick	1
dressed	1
up	1
does	1
not	1
look	1
like	1
a	1
stick;	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
say	1
thou	1
shouldst	1
wear	1
trinkets	1
or	1
fine	1
raiment,	1
or	1
that	1
being	1
a	1
judge	1
thou	1
shouldst	1
dress	1
like	1
a	1
soldier,	1
but	1
that	1
thou	1
shouldst	1
array	1
thyself	1
in	1
the	1
apparel	1
thy	1
office	1
requires,	1
and	1
that	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
it	1
be	1
neat	1
and	1
handsome.	1
To	1
win	1
the	1
good-will	1
of	1
the	1
people	1
thou	1
governest	1
there	1
are	1
two	1
things,	1
among	1
others,	1
that	1
thou	1
must	1
do;	1
one	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
civil	1
to	1
all	1
(this,	1
however,	1
I	1
told	1
thee	1
before),	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
to	1
take	1
care	1
that	1
food	1
be	1
abundant,	1
for	1
there	1
is	1
nothing	1
that	1
vexes	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
the	1
poor	1
more	1
than	1
hunger	1
and	1
high	1
prices.	1
Make	1
not	1
many	1
proclamations;	1
but	1
those	1
thou	1
makest	1
take	1
care	1
that	1
they	1
be	1
good	1
ones,	1
and	1
above	1
all	1
that	1
they	1
be	1
observed	1
and	1
carried	1
out;	1
for	1
proclamations	1
that	1
are	1
not	1
observed	1
are	1
the	1
same	1
as	1
if	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
exist;	1
nay,	1
they	1
encourage	1
the	1
idea	1
that	1
the	1
prince	1
who	1
had	1
the	1
wisdom	1
and	1
authority	1
to	1
make	1
them	1
had	1
not	1
the	1
power	1
to	1
enforce	1
them;	1
and	1
laws	1
that	1
threaten	1
and	1
are	1
not	1
enforced	1
come	1
to	1
be	1
like	1
the	1
log,	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
the	1
frogs,	1
that	1
frightened	1
them	1
at	1
first,	1
but	1
that	1
in	1
time	1
they	1
despised	1
and	1
mounted	1
upon.	1
Be	1
a	1
father	1
to	1
virtue	1
and	1
a	1
stepfather	1
to	1
vice.	1
Be	1
not	1
always	1
strict,	1
nor	1
yet	1
always	1
lenient,	1
but	1
observe	1
a	1
mean	1
between	1
these	1
two	1
extremes,	1
for	1
in	1
that	1
is	1
the	1
aim	1
of	1
wisdom.	1
Visit	1
the	1
gaols,	1
the	1
slaughter-houses,	1
and	1
the	1
market-places;	1
for	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
the	1
governor	1
is	1
of	1
great	1
importance	1
in	1
such	1
places;	1
it	1
comforts	1
the	1
prisoners	1
who	1
are	1
in	1
hopes	1
of	1
a	1
speedy	1
release,	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
bugbear	1
of	1
the	1
butchers	1
who	1
have	1
then	1
to	1
give	1
just	1
weight,	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
terror	1
of	1
the	1
market-women	1
for	1
the	1
same	1
reason.	1
Let	1
it	1
not	1
be	1
seen	1
that	1
thou	1
art	1
(even	1
if	1
perchance	1
thou	1
art,	1
which	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
believe)	1
covetous,	1
a	1
follower	1
of	1
women,	1
or	1
a	1
glutton;	1
for	1
when	1
the	1
people	1
and	1
those	1
that	1
have	1
dealings	1
with	1
thee	1
become	1
aware	1
of	1
thy	1
special	1
weakness	1
they	1
will	1
bring	1
their	1
batteries	1
to	1
bear	1
upon	1
thee	1
in	1
that	1
quarter,	1
till	1
they	1
have	1
brought	1
thee	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
depths	1
of	1
perdition.	1
Consider	1
and	1
reconsider,	1
con	1
and	1
con	1
over	1
again	1
the	1
advices	1
and	1
the	1
instructions	1
I	1
gave	1
thee	1
before	1
thy	1
departure	1
hence	1
to	1
thy	1
government,	1
and	1
thou	1
wilt	1
see	1
that	1
in	1
them,	1
if	1
thou	1
dost	1
follow	1
them,	1
thou	1
hast	1
a	1
help	1
at	1
hand	1
that	1
will	1
lighten	1
for	1
thee	1
the	1
troubles	1
and	1
difficulties	1
that	1
beset	1
governors	1
at	1
every	1
step.	1
Write	1
to	1
thy	1
lord	1
and	1
lady	1
and	1
show	1
thyself	1
grateful	1
to	1
them,	1
for	1
ingratitude	1
is	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
pride,	1
and	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
greatest	1
sins	1
we	1
know	1
of;	1
and	1
he	1
who	1
is	1
grateful	1
to	1
those	1
who	1
have	1
been	1
good	1
to	1
him	1
shows	1
that	1
he	1
will	1
be	1
so	1
to	1
God	1
also	1
who	1
has	1
bestowed	1
and	1
still	1
bestows	1
so	1
many	1
blessings	1
upon	1
him.	1
My	1
lady	1
the	1
duchess	1
sent	1
off	1
a	1
messenger	1
with	1
thy	1
suit	1
and	1
another	1
present	1
to	1
thy	1
wife	1
Teresa	1
Panza;	1
we	1
expect	1
the	1
answer	1
every	1
moment.	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
a	1
little	1
indisposed	1
through	1
a	1
certain	1
scratching	1
I	1
came	1
in	1
for,	1
not	1
very	1
much	1
to	1
the	1
benefit	1
of	1
my	1
nose;	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
nothing;	1
for	1
if	1
there	1
are	1
enchanters	1
who	1
maltreat	1
me,	1
there	1
are	1
also	1
some	1
who	1
defend	1
me.	1
Let	1
me	1
know	1
if	1
the	1
majordomo	1
who	1
is	1
with	1
thee	1
had	1
any	1
share	1
in	1
the	1
Trifaldi	1
performance,	1
as	1
thou	1
didst	1
suspect;	1
and	1
keep	1
me	1
informed	1
of	1
everything	1
that	1
happens	1
thee,	1
as	1
the	1
distance	1
is	1
so	1
short;	1
all	1
the	1
more	1
as	1
I	1
am	1
thinking	1
of	1
giving	1
over	1
very	1
shortly	1
this	1
idle	1
life	1
I	1
am	1
now	1
leading,	1
for	1
I	1
was	1
not	1
born	1
for	1
it.	1
A	1
thing	1
has	1
occurred	1
to	1
me	1
which	1
I	1
am	1
inclined	1
to	1
think	1
will	1
put	1
me	1
out	1
of	1
favour	1
with	1
the	1
duke	1
and	1
duchess;	1
but	1
though	1
I	1
am	1
sorry	1
for	1
it	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
care,	1
for	1
after	1
all	1
I	1
must	1
obey	1
my	1
calling	1
rather	1
than	1
their	1
pleasure,	1
in	1
accordance	1
with	1
the	1
common	1
saying,	1
_amicus	1
Plato,	1
sed	1
magis	1
amica	1
veritas_.	1
I	1
quote	1
this	1
Latin	1
to	1
thee	1
because	1
I	1
conclude	1
that	1
since	1
thou	1
hast	1
been	1
a	1
governor	1
thou	1
wilt	1
have	1
learned	1
it.	1
Adieu;	1
God	1
keep	1
thee	1
from	1
being	1
an	1
object	1
of	1
pity	1
to	1
anyone.	1
Thy	1
friend,	1
DON	1
QUIXOTE	1
OF	1
LA	1
MANCHA.	1
Sancho	1
listened	1
to	1
the	1
letter	1
with	1
great	1
attention,	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
praised	1
and	1
considered	1
wise	1
by	1
all	1
who	1
heard	1
it;	1
he	1
then	1
rose	1
up	1
from	1
table,	1
and	1
calling	1
his	1
secretary	1
shut	1
himself	1
in	1
with	1
him	1
in	1
his	1

without	1

it	1

any	1

about	1

Don	1
Quixote	1
at	1

and	1
he	1
bade	1
the	1

write	1
down	1
what	1
he	1
told	1
him	1
without	1
adding	1
or	1
suppressing	1
anything,	1
which	1

the	1

SANCHO	1
PANZA’S	1
LETTER	1
TO	1
DON	1
QUIXOTE	1
OF	1
LA	1
MANCHA.	1
The	1
pressure	1
of	1
business	1
is	1
so	1
great	1
upon	1
me	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
time	1
to	1
scratch	1
my	1
head	1
or	1
even	1
to	1
cut	1
my	1
nails;	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
them	1
so	1
long—God	1
send	1
a	1
remedy	1
for	1
it.	1
I	1
say	1
this,	1
master	1
of	1
my	1
soul,	1
that	1
you	1
may	1
not	1
be	1
surprised	1
if	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
until	1
now	1
sent	1
you	1
word	1
of	1
how	1
I	1
fare,	1
well	1
or	1
ill,	1
in	1
this	1
government,	1
in	1
which	1
I	1
am	1
suffering	1
more	1
hunger	1
than	1
when	1
we	1
two	1
were	1
wandering	1
through	1
the	1
woods	1
and	1
wastes.	1
My	1
lord	1
the	1
duke	1
wrote	1
to	1
me	1
the	1
other	1
day	1
to	1
warn	1
me	1
that	1
certain	1
spies	1
had	1
got	1
into	1
this	1
island	1
to	1
kill	1
me;	1
but	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
present	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
found	1
out	1
any	1
except	1
a	1
certain	1
doctor	1
who	1
receives	1
a	1
salary	1
in	1
this	1
town	1
for	1
killing	1
all	1
the	1
governors	1
that	1
come	1
here;	1
he	1
is	1
called	1
Doctor	1
Pedro	1
Recio,	1
and	1
is	1
from	1
Tirteafuera;	1
so	1
you	1
see	1
what	1
a	1
name	1
he	1
has	1
to	1
make	1
me	1
dread	1
dying	1
under	1
his	1
hands.	1
This	1
doctor	1
says	1
of	1
himself	1
that	1
he	1
does	1
not	1
cure	1
diseases	1
when	1
there	1
are	1
any,	1
but	1
prevents	1
them	1
coming,	1
and	1
the	1
medicines	1
he	1
uses	1
are	1
diet	1
and	1
more	1
diet	1
until	1
he	1
brings	1
one	1
down	1
to	1
bare	1
bones;	1
as	1
if	1
leanness	1
was	1
not	1
worse	1
than	1
fever.	1
In	1
short	1
he	1
is	1
killing	1
me	1
with	1
hunger,	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
dying	1
myself	1
of	1
vexation;	1
for	1
when	1
I	1
thought	1
I	1
was	1
coming	1
to	1
this	1
government	1
to	1
get	1
my	1
meat	1
hot	1
and	1
my	1
drink	1
cool,	1
and	1
take	1
my	1
ease	1
between	1
holland	1
sheets	1
on	1
feather	1
beds,	1
I	1
find	1
I	1
have	1
come	1
to	1
do	1
penance	1
as	1
if	1
I	1
was	1
a	1
hermit;	1
and	1
as	1
I	1
don’t	1
do	1
it	1
willingly	1
I	1
suspect	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
end	1
the	1
devil	1
will	1
carry	1
me	1
off.	1
So	1
far	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
handled	1
any	1
dues	1
or	1
taken	1
any	1
bribes,	1
and	1
I	1
don’t	1
know	1
what	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
it;	1
for	1
here	1
they	1
tell	1
me	1
that	1
the	1
governors	1
that	1
come	1
to	1
this	1
island,	1
before	1
entering	1
it	1
have	1
plenty	1
of	1
money	1
either	1
given	1
to	1
them	1
or	1
lent	1
to	1
them	1
by	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
town,	1
and	1
that	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
usual	1
custom	1
not	1
only	1
here	1
but	1
with	1
all	1
who	1
enter	1
upon	1
governments.	1
Last	1
night	1
going	1
the	1
rounds	1
I	1
came	1
upon	1
a	1
fair	1
damsel	1
in	1
man’s	1
clothes,	1
and	1
a	1
brother	1
of	1
hers	1
dressed	1
as	1
a	1
woman;	1
my	1
head-carver	1
has	1
fallen	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
the	1
girl,	1
and	1
has	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
mind	1
chosen	1
her	1
for	1
a	1
wife,	1
so	1
he	1
says,	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
chosen	1
the	1
youth	1
for	1
a	1
son-in-law;	1
to-day	1
we	1
are	1
going	1
to	1
explain	1
our	1
intentions	1
to	1
the	1
father	1
of	1
the	1
pair,	1
who	1
is	1
one	1
Diego	1
de	1
la	1
Llana,	1
a	1
gentleman	1
and	1
an	1
old	1
Christian	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
you	1
please.	1
I	1
have	1
visited	1
the	1
market-places,	1
as	1
your	1
worship	1
advises	1
me,	1
and	1
yesterday	1
I	1
found	1
a	1
stall-keeper	1
selling	1
new	1
hazel	1
nuts	1
and	1
proved	1
her	1
to	1
have	1
mixed	1
a	1
bushel	1
of	1
old	1
empty	1
rotten	1
nuts	1
with	1
a	1
bushel	1
of	1
new;	1
I	1
confiscated	1
the	1
whole	1
for	1
the	1
children	1
of	1
the	1
charity-school,	1
who	1
will	1
know	1
how	1
to	1
distinguish	1
them	1
well	1
enough,	1
and	1
I	1
sentenced	1
her	1
not	1
to	1
come	1
into	1
the	1
market-place	1
for	1
a	1
fortnight;	1
they	1
told	1
me	1
I	1
did	1
bravely.	1
I	1
can	1
tell	1
your	1
worship	1
it	1
is	1
commonly	1
said	1
in	1
this	1
town	1
that	1
there	1
are	1
no	1
people	1
worse	1
than	1
the	1
market-women,	1
for	1
they	1
are	1
all	1
barefaced,	1
unconscionable,	1
and	1
impudent,	1
and	1
I	1
can	1
well	1
believe	1
it	1
from	1
what	1
I	1
have	1
seen	1
of	1
them	1
in	1
other	1
towns.	1
I	1
am	1
very	1
glad	1
my	1
lady	1
the	1
duchess	1
has	1
written	1
to	1
my	1
wife	1
Teresa	1
Panza	1
and	1
sent	1
her	1
the	1
present	1
your	1
worship	1
speaks	1
of;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
strive	1
to	1
show	1
myself	1
grateful	1
when	1
the	1
time	1
comes;	1
kiss	1
her	1
hands	1
for	1
me,	1
and	1
tell	1
her	1
I	1
say	1
she	1
has	1
not	1
thrown	1
it	1
into	1
a	1
sack	1
with	1
a	1
hole	1
in	1
it,	1
as	1
she	1
will	1
see	1
in	1
the	1
end.	1
I	1
should	1
not	1
like	1
your	1
worship	1
to	1
have	1
any	1
difference	1
with	1
my	1
lord	1
and	1
lady;	1
for	1
if	1
you	1
fall	1
out	1
with	1
them	1
it	1
is	1
plain	1
it	1
must	1
do	1
me	1
harm;	1
and	1
as	1
you	1
give	1
me	1
advice	1
to	1
be	1
grateful	1
it	1
will	1
not	1
do	1
for	1
your	1
worship	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
so	1
yourself	1
to	1
those	1
who	1
have	1
shown	1
you	1
such	1
kindness,	1
and	1
by	1
whom	1
you	1
have	1
been	1
treated	1
so	1
hospitably	1
in	1
their	1
castle.	1
That	1
about	1
the	1
scratching	1
I	1
don’t	1
understand;	1
but	1
I	1
suppose	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
ill-turns	1
the	1
wicked	1
enchanters	1
are	1
always	1
doing	1
your	1
worship;	1
when	1
we	1
meet	1
I	1
shall	1
know	1
all	1
about	1
it.	1
I	1
wish	1
I	1
could	1
send	1
your	1
worship	1
something;	1
but	1
I	1
don’t	1
know	1
what	1
to	1
send,	1
unless	1
it	1
be	1
some	1
very	1
curious	1
clyster	1
pipes,	1
to	1
work	1
with	1
bladders,	1
that	1
they	1
make	1
in	1
this	1
island;	1
but	1
if	1
the	1
office	1
remains	1
with	1
me	1
I’ll	1
find	1
out	1
something	1
to	1
send,	1
one	1
way	1
or	1
another.	1
If	1
my	1
wife	1
Teresa	1
Panza	1
writes	1
to	1
me,	1
pay	1
the	1
postage	1
and	1
send	1
me	1
the	1
letter,	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
a	1
very	1
great	1
desire	1
to	1
hear	1
how	1
my	1
house	1
and	1
wife	1
and	1
children	1
are	1
going	1
on.	1
And	1
so,	1
may	1
God	1
deliver	1
your	1
worship	1
from	1
evil-minded	1
enchanters,	1
and	1
bring	1
me	1
well	1
and	1
peacefully	1
out	1
of	1
this	1
government,	1
which	1
I	1
doubt,	1
for	1
I	1
expect	1
to	1
take	1
leave	1
of	1
it	1
and	1
my	1
life	1
together,	1
from	1
the	1
way	1
Doctor	1
Pedro	1
Recio	1
treats	1
me.	1
Your	1
worship’s	1
servant	1
SANCHO	1
PANZA	1
THE	1
GOVERNOR.	1
The	1
secretary	1
sealed	1
the	1
letter,	1
and	1
immediately	1
dismissed	1
the	1
courier;	1
and	1
those	1
who	1
were	1
carrying	1
on	1
the	1
joke	1
against	1
Sancho	1
putting	1
their	1
heads	1
together	1
arranged	1
how	1
he	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
dismissed	1
from	1
the	1
government.	1
Sancho	1
spent	1
the	1
afternoon	1
in	1
drawing	1
up	1
certain	1
ordinances	1
relating	1
to	1
the	1
good	1
government	1
of	1
what	1
he	1
fancied	1
the	1
island;	1
and	1
he	1
ordained	1
that	1
there	1
were	1
to	1
be	1
no	1
provision	1
hucksters	1
in	1
the	1
State,	1
and	1
that	1
men	1
might	1
import	1
wine	1
into	1
it	1
from	1
any	1
place	1
they	1
pleased,	1
provided	1
they	1
declared	1
the	1
quarter	1
it	1
came	1
from,	1
so	1
that	1
a	1
price	1
might	1
be	1
put	1
upon	1
it	1
according	1
to	1
its	1
quality,	1
reputation,	1
and	1
the	1
estimation	1
it	1
was	1
held	1
in;	1
and	1
he	1
that	1
watered	1
his	1
wine,	1
or	1
changed	1
the	1
name,	1
was	1
to	1
forfeit	1
his	1
life	1
for	1
it.	1
He	1
reduced	1
the	1
prices	1
of	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
shoes,	1
boots,	1
and	1
stockings,	1
but	1
of	1
shoes	1
in	1
particular,	1
as	1
they	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
to	1
run	1
extravagantly	1
high.	1
He	1
established	1
a	1
fixed	1
rate	1
for	1
servants’	1
wages,	1
which	1
were	1
becoming	1
recklessly	1
exorbitant.	1
He	1
laid	1
extremely	1
heavy	1
penalties	1
upon	1
those	1
who	1
sang	1
lewd	1
or	1
loose	1
songs	1
either	1
by	1
day	1
or	1
night.	1
He	1
decreed	1
that	1
no	1
blind	1
man	1
should	1
sing	1
of	1
any	1
miracle	1
in	1
verse,	1
unless	1
he	1
could	1
produce	1
authentic	1
evidence	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
true,	1
for	1
it	1
was	1
his	1
opinion	1
that	1
most	1
of	1
those	1
the	1
blind	1
men	1
sing	1
are	1
trumped	1
up,	1
to	1
the	1
detriment	1
of	1
the	1
true	1
ones.	1
He	1
established	1
and	1
created	1
an	1
alguacil	1
of	1
the	1
poor,	1
not	1
to	1
harass	1
them,	1
but	1
to	1
examine	1
them	1
and	1
see	1
whether	1
they	1
really	1
were	1
so;	1
for	1
many	1
a	1
sturdy	1
thief	1
or	1
drunkard	1
goes	1
about	1
under	1
cover	1
of	1
a	1
make-believe	1
crippled	1
limb	1
or	1
a	1
sham	1
sore.	1
In	1
a	1
word,	1
he	1
made	1
so	1
many	1
good	1
rules	1
that	1
to	1
this	1
day	1
they	1
are	1
preserved	1
there,	1
and	1
are	1
called	1
_The	1
constitutions	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
governor	1
Sancho	1

Cide	1
Hamete	1
relates	1
that	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
being	1
now	1
cured	1
of	1
his	1
scratches	1
felt	1
that	1
the	1
life	1
he	1
was	1
leading	1
in	1
the	1
castle	1
was	1
entirely	1
inconsistent	1
with	1
the	1
order	1
of	1
chivalry	1
he	1
professed,	1
so	1
he	1
determined	1
to	1
ask	1
the	1
duke	1
and	1
duchess	1
to	1
permit	1
him	1
to	1
take	1
his	1
departure	1
for	1
Saragossa,	1
as	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
the	1
festival	1
was	1
now	1
drawing	1
near,	1
and	1
he	1
hoped	1
to	1
win	1
there	1
the	1
suit	1
of	1
armour	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
prize	1
at	1
festivals	1
of	1
the	1
sort.	1
But	1
one	1
day	1
at	1
table	1
with	1
the	1
duke	1
and	1
duchess,	1
just	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
carry	1
his	1
resolution	1
into	1
effect	1
and	1
ask	1
for	1
their	1
permission,	1
lo	1
and	1
behold	1
suddenly	1
there	1
came	1
in	1
through	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
hall	1
two	1
women,	1
as	1
they	1
afterwards	1
proved	1
to	1
be,	1
draped	1
in	1
mourning	1
from	1
head	1
to	1
foot,	1
one	1
of	1
whom	1
approaching	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
flung	1
herself	1
at	1
full	1
length	1
at	1
his	1
feet,	1
pressing	1
her	1
lips	1
to	1
them,	1
and	1
uttering	1
moans	1
so	1
sad,	1
so	1
deep,	1
and	1
so	1
doleful	1
that	1
she	1
put	1
all	1
who	1
heard	1
and	1
saw	1
her	1
into	1
a	1
state	1
of	1
perplexity;	1
and	1
though	1
the	1
duke	1
and	1
duchess	1
supposed	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
some	1
joke	1
their	1
servants	1
were	1
playing	1
off	1
upon	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
still	1
the	1
earnest	1
way	1
the	1
woman	1
sighed	1
and	1
moaned	1
and	1
wept	1
puzzled	1
them	1
and	1
made	1
them	1
feel	1
uncertain,	1
until	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
touched	1
with	1
compassion,	1
raised	1
her	1
up	1
and	1
made	1
her	1
unveil	1
herself	1
and	1
remove	1
the	1
mantle	1
from	1
her	1
tearful	1
face.	1
She	1
complied	1
and	1
disclosed	1
what	1
no	1
one	1
could	1
have	1
ever	1
anticipated,	1
for	1
she	1
disclosed	1
the	1
countenance	1
of	1
Doña	1
Rodriguez,	1
the	1
duenna	1
of	1
the	1
house;	1
the	1
other	1
female	1
in	1
mourning	1
being	1
her	1
daughter,	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
made	1
a	1
fool	1
of	1
by	1
the	1
rich	1
farmer’s	1
son.	1
All	1
who	1
knew	1
her	1
were	1
filled	1
with	1
astonishment,	1
and	1
the	1
duke	1
and	1
duchess	1
more	1
than	1
any;	1
for	1
though	1
they	1
thought	1
her	1
a	1
simpleton	1
and	1
a	1
weak	1
creature,	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
think	1
her	1
capable	1
of	1
crazy	1
pranks.	1
Doña	1
Rodriguez,	1
at	1
length,	1
turning	1
to	1
her	1
master	1
and	1
mistress	1
said	1
to	1
them,	1
“Will	1
your	1
excellences	1
be	1
pleased	1
to	1
permit	1
me	1
to	1
speak	1
to	1
this	1
gentleman	1
for	1
a	1
moment,	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
requisite	1
I	1
should	1
do	1
so	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
get	1
successfully	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
business	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
boldness	1
of	1
an	1
evil-minded	1
clown	1
has	1
involved	1
me?”	1
The	1
duke	1
said	1
that	1
for	1
his	1
part	1
he	1
gave	1
her	1
leave,	1
and	1
that	1
she	1
might	1
speak	1
with	1
Señor	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
she	1
liked.	1
She	1
then,	1
turning	1
to	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
and	1
addressing	1
herself	1
to	1
him	1
said,	1
“Some	1
days	1
since,	1
valiant	1
knight,	1
I	1
gave	1
you	1
an	1
account	1
of	1
the	1
injustice	1
and	1
treachery	1
of	1
a	1
wicked	1
farmer	1
to	1
my	1
dearly	1
beloved	1
daughter,	1
the	1
unhappy	1
damsel	1
here	1
before	1
you,	1
and	1
you	1
promised	1
me	1
to	1
take	1
her	1
part	1
and	1
right	1
the	1
wrong	1
that	1
has	1
been	1
done	1
her;	1
but	1
now	1
it	1
has	1
come	1
to	1
my	1
hearing	1
that	1
you	1
are	1
about	1
to	1
depart	1
from	1
this	1
castle	1
in	1
quest	1
of	1
such	1
fair	1
adventures	1
as	1
God	1
may	1
vouchsafe	1
to	1
you;	1
therefore,	1
before	1
you	1
take	1
the	1
road,	1
I	1
would	1
that	1
you	1
challenge	1
this	1
froward	1
rustic,	1
and	1
compel	1
him	1
to	1
marry	1
my	1
daughter	1
in	1
fulfillment	1
of	1
the	1
promise	1
he	1
gave	1
her	1
to	1
become	1
her	1
husband	1
before	1
he	1
seduced	1
her;	1
for	1
to	1
expect	1
that	1
my	1
lord	1
the	1
duke	1
will	1
do	1
me	1
justice	1
is	1
to	1
ask	1
pears	1
from	1
the	1
elm	1
tree,	1
for	1
the	1
reason	1
I	1
stated	1
privately	1
to	1
your	1
worship;	1
and	1
so	1
may	1
our	1
Lord	1
grant	1
you	1
good	1
health	1
and	1
forsake	1
us	1
not.”	1
To	1
these	1
words	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
replied	1
very	1
gravely	1
and	1
solemnly,	1
“Worthy	1
duenna,	1
check	1
your	1
tears,	1
or	1
rather	1
dry	1
them,	1
and	1
spare	1
your	1
sighs,	1
for	1
I	1
take	1
it	1
upon	1
myself	1
to	1
obtain	1
redress	1
for	1
your	1
daughter,	1
for	1
whom	1
it	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
better	1
not	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
so	1
ready	1
to	1
believe	1
lovers’	1
promises,	1
which	1
are	1
for	1
the	1
most	1
part	1
quickly	1
made	1
and	1
very	1
slowly	1
performed;	1
and	1
so,	1
with	1
my	1
lord	1
the	1
duke’s	1
leave,	1
I	1
will	1
at	1
once	1
go	1
in	1
quest	1
of	1
this	1
inhuman	1
youth,	1
and	1
will	1
find	1
him	1
out	1
and	1
challenge	1
him	1
and	1
slay	1
him,	1
if	1
so	1
be	1
he	1
refuses	1
to	1
keep	1
his	1
promised	1
word;	1
for	1
the	1
chief	1
object	1
of	1
my	1
profession	1
is	1
to	1
spare	1
the	1
humble	1
and	1
chastise	1
the	1
proud;	1
I	1
mean,	1
to	1
help	1
the	1
distressed	1
and	1
destroy	1
the	1
oppressors.”	1
“There	1
is	1
no	1
necessity,”	1
said	1
the	1
duke,	1
“for	1
your	1
worship	1
to	1
take	1
the	1
trouble	1
of	1
seeking	1
out	1
the	1
rustic	1
of	1
whom	1
this	1
worthy	1
duenna	1
complains,	1
nor	1
is	1
there	1
any	1
necessity,	1
either,	1
for	1
asking	1
my	1
leave	1
to	1
challenge	1
him;	1
for	1
I	1
admit	1
him	1
duly	1
challenged,	1
and	1
will	1
take	1
care	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
informed	1
of	1
the	1
challenge,	1
and	1
accepts	1
it,	1
and	1
comes	1
to	1
answer	1
it	1
in	1
person	1
to	1
this	1
castle	1
of	1
mine,	1
where	1
I	1
shall	1
afford	1
to	1
both	1
a	1
fair	1
field,	1
observing	1
all	1
the	1
conditions	1
which	1
are	1
usually	1
and	1
properly	1
observed	1
in	1
such	1
trials,	1
and	1
observing	1
too	1
justice	1
to	1
both	1
sides,	1
as	1
all	1
princes	1
who	1
offer	1
a	1
free	1
field	1
to	1
combatants	1
within	1
the	1
limits	1
of	1
their	1
lordships	1
are	1
bound	1
to	1
do.”	1
“Then	1
with	1
that	1
assurance	1
and	1
your	1
highness’s	1
good	1
leave,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“I	1
hereby	1
for	1
this	1
once	1
waive	1
my	1
privilege	1
of	1
gentle	1
blood,	1
and	1
come	1
down	1
and	1
put	1
myself	1
on	1
a	1
level	1
with	1
the	1
lowly	1
birth	1
of	1
the	1
wrong-doer,	1
making	1
myself	1
equal	1
with	1
him	1
and	1
enabling	1
him	1
to	1
enter	1
into	1
combat	1
with	1
me;	1
and	1
so,	1
I	1
challenge	1
and	1
defy	1
him,	1
though	1
absent,	1
on	1
the	1
plea	1
of	1
his	1
malfeasance	1
in	1
breaking	1
faith	1
with	1
this	1
poor	1
damsel,	1
who	1
was	1
a	1
maiden	1
and	1
now	1
by	1
his	1
misdeed	1
is	1
none;	1
and	1
say	1
that	1
he	1
shall	1
fulfill	1
the	1
promise	1
he	1
gave	1
her	1
to	1
become	1
her	1
lawful	1
husband,	1
or	1
else	1
stake	1
his	1
life	1
upon	1
the	1
question.”	1
And	1
then	1
plucking	1
off	1
a	1
glove	1
he	1
threw	1
it	1
down	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
hall,	1
and	1
the	1
duke	1
picked	1
it	1
up,	1
saying,	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
said	1
before,	1
that	1
he	1
accepted	1
the	1
challenge	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
his	1
vassal,	1
and	1
fixed	1
six	1
days	1
thence	1
as	1
the	1
time,	1
the	1
courtyard	1
of	1
the	1
castle	1
as	1
the	1
place,	1
and	1
for	1
arms	1
the	1
customary	1
ones	1
of	1
knights,	1
lance	1
and	1
shield	1
and	1
full	1
armour,	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
other	1
accessories,	1
without	1
trickery,	1
guile,	1
or	1
charms	1
of	1
any	1
sort,	1
and	1
examined	1
and	1
passed	1
by	1
the	1
judges	1
of	1
the	1
field.	1
“But	1
first	1
of	1
all,”	1
he	1
said,	1
“it	1
is	1
requisite	1
that	1
this	1
worthy	1
duenna	1
and	1
unworthy	1
damsel	1
should	1
place	1
their	1
claim	1
for	1
justice	1
in	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
for	1
otherwise	1
nothing	1
can	1
be	1
done,	1
nor	1
can	1
the	1
said	1
challenge	1
be	1
brought	1
to	1
a	1
lawful	1
issue.”	1
“I	1
do	1
so	1
place	1
it,”	1
replied	1
the	1
duenna.	1
“And	1
I	1
too,”	1
added	1
her	1
daughter,	1
all	1
in	1
tears	1
and	1
covered	1
with	1
shame	1
and	1
confusion.	1
This	1
declaration	1
having	1
been	1
made,	1
and	1
the	1
duke	1
having	1
settled	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
mind	1
what	1
he	1
would	1
do	1
in	1
the	1
matter,	1
the	1
ladies	1
in	1
black	1
withdrew,	1
and	1
the	1
duchess	1
gave	1
orders	1
that	1
for	1
the	1
future	1
they	1
were	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
treated	1
as	1
servants	1
of	1
hers,	1
but	1
as	1
lady	1
adventurers	1
who	1
came	1
to	1
her	1
house	1
to	1
demand	1
justice;	1
so	1
they	1
gave	1
them	1
a	1
room	1
to	1
themselves	1
and	1
waited	1
on	1
them	1
as	1
they	1
would	1
on	1
strangers,	1
to	1
the	1
consternation	1
of	1
the	1
other	1
women-servants,	1
who	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
where	1
the	1
folly	1
and	1
imprudence	1
of	1
Doña	1
Rodriguez	1
and	1
her	1
unlucky	1
daughter	1
would	1
stop.	1
And	1
now,	1
to	1
complete	1
the	1
enjoyment	1
of	1
the	1
feast	1
and	1
bring	1
the	1
dinner	1
to	1
a	1
satisfactory	1
end,	1
lo	1
and	1
behold	1
the	1
page	1
who	1
had	1
carried	1
the	1
letters	1
and	1
presents	1
to	1
Teresa	1
Panza,	1
the	1
wife	1
of	1
the	1
governor	1
Sancho,	1
entered	1
the	1
hall;	1
and	1
the	1
duke	1
and	1
duchess	1
were	1
very	1
well	1
pleased	1
to	1
see	1
him,	1
being	1
anxious	1
to	1
know	1
the	1
result	1
of	1
his	1
journey;	1
but	1
when	1
they	1
asked	1
him	1
the	1
page	1
said	1
in	1
reply	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
give	1
it	1
before	1
so	1
many	1
people	1
or	1
in	1
a	1
few	1
words,	1
and	1
begged	1
their	1
excellences	1
to	1
be	1
pleased	1
to	1
let	1
it	1
wait	1
for	1
a	1
private	1
opportunity,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
meantime	1
amuse	1
themselves	1
with	1
these	1
letters;	1
and	1
taking	1
out	1
the	1
letters	1
he	1
placed	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
duchess’s	1
hand.	1
One	1
bore	1
by	1
way	1
of	1
address,	1
_Letter	1
for	1
my	1
lady	1
the	1
Duchess	1
So-and-so,	1
of	1
I	1
don’t	1
know	1
where;	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
To	1
my	1
husband	1
Sancho	1
Panza,	1
governor	1
of	1
the	1
island	1
of	1
Barataria,	1
whom	1
God	1
prosper	1
longer	1
than	1
me_.	1
The	1
duchess’s	1
bread	1
would	1
not	1
bake,	1
as	1
the	1
saying	1
is,	1
until	1
she	1
had	1
read	1
her	1
letter;	1
and	1
having	1
looked	1
over	1
it	1
herself	1
and	1
seen	1
that	1
it	1
might	1
be	1
read	1
aloud	1
for	1
the	1
duke	1
and	1
all	1
present	1
to	1
hear,	1
she	1
read	1
out	1
as	1
follows.	1
TERESA	1
PANZA’S	1
LETTER	1
TO	1
THE	1
DUCHESS.	1
The	1
letter	1
your	1
highness	1
wrote	1
me,	1
my	1
lady,	1
gave	1
me	1
great	1
pleasure,	1
for	1
indeed	1
I	1
found	1
it	1
very	1
welcome.	1
The	1
string	1
of	1
coral	1
beads	1
is	1
very	1
fine,	1
and	1
my	1
husband’s	1
hunting	1
suit	1
does	1
not	1
fall	1
short	1
of	1
it.	1
All	1
this	1
village	1
is	1
very	1
much	1
pleased	1
that	1
your	1
ladyship	1
has	1
made	1
a	1
governor	1
of	1
my	1
good	1
man	1
Sancho;	1
though	1
nobody	1
will	1
believe	1
it,	1
particularly	1
the	1
curate,	1
and	1
Master	1
Nicholas	1
the	1
barber,	1
and	1
the	1
bachelor	1
Samson	1
Carrasco;	1
but	1
I	1
don’t	1
care	1
for	1
that,	1
for	1
so	1
long	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
true,	1
as	1
it	1
is,	1
they	1
may	1
all	1
say	1
what	1
they	1
like;	1
though,	1
to	1
tell	1
the	1
truth,	1
if	1
the	1
coral	1
beads	1
and	1
the	1
suit	1
had	1
not	1
come	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
believed	1
it	1
either;	1
for	1
in	1
this	1
village	1
everybody	1
thinks	1
my	1
husband	1
a	1
numskull,	1
and	1
except	1
for	1
governing	1
a	1
flock	1
of	1
goats,	1
they	1
cannot	1
fancy	1
what	1
sort	1
of	1
government	1
he	1
can	1
be	1
fit	1
for.	1
God	1
grant	1
it,	1
and	1
direct	1
him	1
according	1
as	1
he	1
sees	1
his	1
children	1
stand	1
in	1
need	1
of	1
it.	1
I	1
am	1
resolved	1
with	1
your	1
worship’s	1
leave,	1
lady	1
of	1
my	1
soul,	1
to	1
make	1
the	1
most	1
of	1
this	1
fair	1
day,	1
and	1
go	1
to	1
Court	1
to	1
stretch	1
myself	1
at	1
ease	1
in	1
a	1
coach,	1
and	1
make	1
all	1
those	1
I	1
have	1
envying	1
me	1
already	1
burst	1
their	1
eyes	1
out;	1
so	1
I	1
beg	1
your	1
excellence	1
to	1
order	1
my	1
husband	1
to	1
send	1
me	1
a	1
small	1
trifle	1
of	1
money,	1
and	1
to	1
let	1
it	1
be	1
something	1
to	1
speak	1
of,	1
because	1
one’s	1
expenses	1
are	1
heavy	1
at	1
the	1
Court;	1
for	1
a	1
loaf	1
costs	1
a	1
real,	1
and	1
meat	1
thirty	1
maravedis	1
a	1
pound,	1
which	1
is	1
beyond	1
everything;	1
and	1
if	1
he	1
does	1
not	1
want	1
me	1
to	1
go	1
let	1
him	1
tell	1
me	1
in	1
time,	1
for	1
my	1
feet	1
are	1
on	1
the	1
fidgets	1
to	1
be	1
off;	1
and	1
my	1
friends	1
and	1
neighbours	1
tell	1
me	1
that	1
if	1
my	1
daughter	1
and	1
I	1
make	1
a	1
figure	1
and	1
a	1
brave	1
show	1
at	1
Court,	1
my	1
husband	1
will	1
come	1
to	1
be	1
known	1
far	1
more	1
by	1
me	1
than	1
I	1
by	1
him,	1
for	1
of	1
course	1
plenty	1
of	1
people	1
will	1
ask,	1
“Who	1
are	1
those	1
ladies	1
in	1
that	1
coach?”	1
and	1
some	1
servant	1
of	1
mine	1
will	1
answer,	1
“The	1
wife	1
and	1
daughter	1
of	1
Sancho	1
Panza,	1
governor	1
of	1
the	1
island	1
of	1
Barataria;”	1
and	1
in	1
this	1
way	1
Sancho	1
will	1
become	1
known,	1
and	1
I’ll	1
be	1
thought	1
well	1
of,	1
and	1
“to	1
Rome	1
for	1
everything.”	1
I	1
am	1
as	1
vexed	1
as	1
vexed	1
can	1
be	1
that	1
they	1
have	1
gathered	1
no	1
acorns	1
this	1
year	1
in	1
our	1
village;	1
for	1
all	1
that	1
I	1
send	1
your	1
highness	1
about	1
half	1
a	1
peck	1
that	1
I	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
wood	1
to	1
gather	1
and	1
pick	1
out	1
one	1
by	1
one	1
myself,	1
and	1
I	1
could	1
find	1
no	1
bigger	1
ones;	1
I	1
wish	1
they	1
were	1
as	1
big	1
as	1
ostrich	1
eggs.	1
Let	1
not	1
your	1
high	1
mightiness	1
forget	1
to	1
write	1
to	1
me;	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
take	1
care	1
to	1
answer,	1
and	1
let	1
you	1
know	1
how	1
I	1
am,	1
and	1
whatever	1
news	1
there	1
may	1
be	1
in	1
this	1
place,	1
where	1
I	1
remain,	1
praying	1
our	1
Lord	1
to	1
have	1
your	1
highness	1
in	1
his	1
keeping	1
and	1
not	1
to	1
forget	1
me.	1
Sancha	1
my	1
daughter,	1
and	1
my	1
son,	1
kiss	1
your	1
worship’s	1
hands.	1
She	1
who	1
would	1
rather	1
see	1
your	1
ladyship	1
than	1
write	1
to	1
you,	1
Your	1
servant,	1
TERESA	1
PANZA.	1
All	1
were	1
greatly	1
amused	1
by	1
Teresa	1
Panza’s	1
letter,	1
but	1
particularly	1
the	1
duke	1
and	1
duchess;	1
and	1
the	1
duchess	1
asked	1
Don	1
Quixote’s	1
opinion	1
whether	1
they	1
might	1
open	1
the	1
letter	1
that	1
had	1
come	1
for	1
the	1
governor,	1
which	1
she	1
suspected	1
must	1
be	1
very	1
good.	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
said	1
that	1
to	1
gratify	1
them	1
he	1
would	1
open	1
it,	1
and	1
did	1
so,	1
and	1
found	1
that	1
it	1
ran	1
as	1
follows.	1
TERESA	1
PANZA’S	1
LETTER	1
TO	1
HER	1
HUSBAND	1
SANCHO	1
PANZA.	1
I	1
got	1
thy	1
letter,	1
Sancho	1
of	1
my	1
soul,	1
and	1
I	1
promise	1
thee	1
and	1
swear	1
as	1
a	1
Catholic	1
Christian	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
within	1
two	1
fingers’	1
breadth	1
of	1
going	1
mad	1
I	1
was	1
so	1
happy.	1
I	1
can	1
tell	1
thee,	1
brother,	1
when	1
I	1
came	1
to	1
hear	1
that	1
thou	1
wert	1
a	1
governor	1
I	1
thought	1
I	1
should	1
have	1
dropped	1
dead	1
with	1
pure	1
joy;	1
and	1
thou	1
knowest	1
they	1
say	1
sudden	1
joy	1
kills	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
great	1
sorrow;	1
and	1
as	1
for	1
Sanchica	1
thy	1
daughter,	1
she	1
leaked	1
from	1
sheer	1
happiness.	1
I	1
had	1
before	1
me	1
the	1
suit	1
thou	1
didst	1
send	1
me,	1
and	1
the	1
coral	1
beads	1
my	1
lady	1
the	1
duchess	1
sent	1
me	1
round	1
my	1
neck,	1
and	1
the	1
letters	1
in	1
my	1
hands,	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
the	1
bearer	1
of	1
them	1
standing	1
by,	1
and	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
all	1
this	1
I	1
verily	1
believed	1
and	1
thought	1
that	1
what	1
I	1
saw	1
and	1
handled	1
was	1
all	1
a	1
dream;	1
for	1
who	1
could	1
have	1
thought	1
that	1
a	1
goatherd	1
would	1
come	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
governor	1
of	1
islands?	1
Thou	1
knowest,	1
my	1
friend,	1
what	1
my	1
mother	1
used	1
to	1
say,	1
that	1
one	1
must	1
live	1
long	1
to	1
see	1
much;	1
I	1
say	1
it	1
because	1
I	1
expect	1
to	1
see	1
more	1
if	1
I	1
live	1
longer;	1
for	1
I	1
don’t	1
expect	1
to	1
stop	1
until	1
I	1
see	1
thee	1
a	1
farmer	1
of	1
taxes	1
or	1
a	1
collector	1
of	1
revenue,	1
which	1
are	1
offices	1
where,	1
though	1
the	1
devil	1
carries	1
off	1
those	1
who	1
make	1
a	1
bad	1
use	1
of	1
them,	1
still	1
they	1
make	1
and	1
handle	1
money.	1
My	1
lady	1
the	1
duchess	1
will	1
tell	1
thee	1
the	1
desire	1
I	1
have	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
Court;	1
consider	1
the	1
matter	1
and	1
let	1
me	1
know	1
thy	1
pleasure;	1
I	1
will	1
try	1
to	1
do	1
honour	1
to	1
thee	1
by	1
going	1
in	1
a	1
coach.	1
Neither	1
the	1
curate,	1
nor	1
the	1
barber,	1
nor	1
the	1
bachelor,	1
nor	1
even	1
the	1
sacristan,	1
can	1
believe	1
that	1
thou	1
art	1
a	1
governor,	1
and	1
they	1
say	1
the	1
whole	1
thing	1
is	1
a	1
delusion	1
or	1
an	1
enchantment	1
affair,	1
like	1
everything	1
belonging	1
to	1
thy	1
master	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
and	1
Samson	1
says	1
he	1
must	1
go	1
in	1
search	1
of	1
thee	1
and	1
drive	1
the	1
government	1
out	1
of	1
thy	1
head	1
and	1
the	1
madness	1
out	1
of	1
Don	1
Quixote’s	1
skull;	1
I	1
only	1
laugh,	1
and	1
look	1
at	1
my	1
string	1
of	1
beads,	1
and	1
plan	1
out	1
the	1
dress	1
I	1
am	1
going	1
to	1
make	1
for	1
our	1
daughter	1
out	1
of	1
thy	1
suit.	1
I	1
sent	1
some	1
acorns	1
to	1
my	1
lady	1
the	1
duchess;	1
I	1
wish	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
gold.	1
Send	1
me	1
some	1
strings	1
of	1
pearls	1
if	1
they	1
are	1
in	1
fashion	1
in	1
that	1
island.	1
Here	1
is	1
the	1
news	1
of	1
the	1
village;	1
La	1
Berrueca	1
has	1
married	1
her	1
daughter	1
to	1
a	1
good-for-nothing	1
painter,	1
who	1
came	1
here	1
to	1
paint	1
anything	1
that	1
might	1
turn	1
up.	1
The	1
council	1
gave	1
him	1
an	1
order	1
to	1
paint	1
his	1
Majesty’s	1
arms	1
over	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
town-hall;	1
he	1
asked	1
two	1
ducats,	1
which	1
they	1
paid	1
him	1
in	1
advance;	1
he	1
worked	1
for	1
eight	1
days,	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
them	1
had	1
nothing	1
painted,	1
and	1
then	1
said	1
he	1
had	1
no	1
turn	1
for	1
painting	1
such	1
trifling	1
things;	1
he	1
returned	1
the	1
money,	1
and	1
for	1
all	1
that	1
has	1
married	1
on	1
the	1
pretence	1
of	1
being	1
a	1
good	1
workman;	1
to	1
be	1
sure	1
he	1
has	1
now	1
laid	1
aside	1
his	1
paint-brush	1
and	1
taken	1
a	1
spade	1
in	1
hand,	1
and	1
goes	1
to	1
the	1
field	1
like	1
a	1
gentleman.	1
Pedro	1
Lobo’s	1
son	1
has	1
received	1
the	1
first	1
orders	1
and	1
tonsure,	1
with	1
the	1
intention	1
of	1
becoming	1
a	1
priest.	1
Minguilla,	1
Mingo	1
Silvato’s	1
granddaughter,	1
found	1
it	1
out,	1
and	1
has	1
gone	1
to	1
law	1
with	1
him	1
on	1
the	1
score	1
of	1
having	1
given	1
her	1
promise	1
of	1
marriage.	1
Evil	1
tongues	1
say	1
she	1
is	1
with	1
child	1
by	1
him,	1
but	1
he	1
denies	1
it	1
stoutly.	1
There	1
are	1
no	1
olives	1
this	1
year,	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
drop	1
of	1
vinegar	1
to	1
be	1
had	1
in	1
the	1
whole	1
village.	1
A	1
company	1
of	1
soldiers	1
passed	1
through	1
here;	1
when	1
they	1
left	1
they	1
took	1
away	1
with	1
them	1
three	1
of	1
the	1
girls	1
of	1
the	1
village;	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
tell	1
thee	1
who	1
they	1
are;	1
perhaps	1
they	1
will	1
come	1
back,	1
and	1
they	1
will	1
be	1
sure	1
to	1
find	1
those	1
who	1
will	1
take	1
them	1
for	1
wives	1
with	1
all	1
their	1
blemishes,	1
good	1
or	1
bad.	1
Sanchica	1
is	1
making	1
bonelace;	1
she	1
earns	1
eight	1
maravedis	1
a	1
day	1
clear,	1
which	1
she	1
puts	1
into	1
a	1
moneybox	1
as	1
a	1
help	1
towards	1
house	1
furnishing;	1
but	1
now	1
that	1
she	1
is	1
a	1
governor’s	1
daughter	1
thou	1
wilt	1
give	1
her	1
a	1
portion	1
without	1
her	1
working	1
for	1
it.	1
The	1
fountain	1
in	1
the	1
plaza	1
has	1
run	1
dry.	1
A	1
flash	1
of	1
lightning	1
struck	1
the	1
gibbet,	1
and	1
I	1
wish	1
they	1
all	1
lit	1
there.	1
I	1
look	1
for	1
an	1
answer	1
to	1
this,	1
and	1
to	1
know	1
thy	1
mind	1
about	1
my	1
going	1
to	1
the	1
Court;	1
and	1
so,	1
God	1
keep	1
thee	1
longer	1
than	1
me,	1
or	1
as	1
long,	1
for	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
leave	1
thee	1
in	1
this	1
world	1
without	1
me.	1
Thy	1
wife,	1
TERESA	1
PANZA.	1
The	1
letters	1
were	1
applauded,	1
laughed	1
over,	1
relished,	1
and	1
admired;	1
and	1
then,	1
as	1
if	1
to	1
put	1
the	1
seal	1
to	1
the	1
business,	1
the	1
courier	1
arrived,	1
bringing	1
the	1
one	1
Sancho	1
sent	1
to	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
and	1
this,	1
too,	1
was	1
read	1
out,	1
and	1
it	1
raised	1
some	1
doubts	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
governor’s	1
simplicity.	1
The	1
duchess	1
withdrew	1
to	1
hear	1
from	1
the	1
page	1
about	1
his	1
adventures	1
in	1
Sancho’s	1
village,	1
which	1
he	1
narrated	1
at	1
full	1
length	1
without	1
leaving	1
a	1
single	1
circumstance	1
unmentioned.	1
He	1
gave	1
her	1
the	1
acorns,	1
and	1
also	1
a	1
cheese	1
which	1
Teresa	1
had	1
given	1
him	1
as	1
being	1
particularly	1
good	1
and	1
superior	1
to	1
those	1
of	1
Tronchon.	1
The	1
duchess	1
received	1
it	1
with	1
greatest	1
delight,	1
in	1
which	1
we	1
will	1
leave	1
her,	1
to	1
describe	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
government	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
Sancho	1
Panza,	1
flower	1
and	1
mirror	1
of	1
all	1
governors	1
of	1
islands.	1

Full	1

To	1
fancy	1
that	1
in	1
this	1
life	1
anything	1
belonging	1
to	1
it	1
will	1
remain	1
for	1
ever	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
state	1
is	1
an	1
idle	1
fancy;	1
on	1
the	1
contrary,	1
in	1
it	1
everything	1
seems	1
to	1
go	1
in	1
a	1
circle,	1
I	1
mean	1
round	1
and	1
round.	1
The	1
spring	1
succeeds	1
the	1
summer,	1
the	1
summer	1
the	1
fall,	1
the	1
fall	1
the	1
autumn,	1
the	1
autumn	1
the	1
winter,	1
and	1
the	1
winter	1
the	1
spring,	1
and	1
so	1
time	1
rolls	1
with	1
never-ceasing	1
wheel.	1
Man’s	1
life	1
alone,	1
swifter	1
than	1
time,	1
speeds	1
onward	1
to	1
its	1
end	1
without	1
any	1
hope	1
of	1
renewal,	1
save	1
it	1
be	1
in	1
that	1
other	1
life	1
which	1
is	1
endless	1
and	1
boundless.	1
Thus	1
saith	1
Cide	1
Hamete	1
the	1
Mahometan	1
philosopher;	1
for	1
there	1
are	1
many	1
that	1
by	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
nature	1
alone,	1
without	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
faith,	1
have	1
a	1
comprehension	1
of	1
the	1
fleeting	1
nature	1
and	1
instability	1
of	1
this	1
present	1
life	1
and	1
the	1
endless	1
duration	1
of	1
that	1
eternal	1
life	1
we	1
hope	1
for;	1
but	1
our	1
author	1
is	1
here	1
speaking	1
of	1
the	1
rapidity	1
with	1
which	1
Sancho’s	1
government	1
came	1
to	1
an	1
end,	1
melted	1
away,	1
disappeared,	1
vanished	1
as	1
it	1
were	1
in	1
smoke	1
and	1
shadow.	1
For	1
as	1
he	1
lay	1
in	1
bed	1
on	1
the	1
night	1
of	1
the	1
seventh	1
day	1
of	1
his	1
government,	1
sated,	1
not	1
with	1
bread	1
and	1
wine,	1
but	1
with	1
delivering	1
judgments	1
and	1
giving	1
opinions	1
and	1
making	1
laws	1
and	1
proclamations,	1
just	1
as	1
sleep,	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
hunger,	1
was	1
beginning	1
to	1
close	1
his	1
eyelids,	1
he	1
heard	1
such	1
a	1
noise	1
of	1
bell-ringing	1
and	1
shouting	1
that	1
one	1
would	1
have	1
fancied	1
the	1
whole	1
island	1
was	1
going	1
to	1
the	1
bottom.	1
He	1
sat	1
up	1
in	1
bed	1
and	1
remained	1
listening	1
intently	1
to	1
try	1
if	1
he	1
could	1
make	1
out	1
what	1
could	1
be	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
so	1
great	1
an	1
uproar;	1
not	1
only,	1
however,	1
was	1
he	1
unable	1
to	1
discover	1
what	1
it	1
was,	1
but	1
as	1
countless	1
drums	1
and	1
trumpets	1
now	1
helped	1
to	1
swell	1
the	1
din	1
of	1
the	1
bells	1
and	1
shouts,	1
he	1
was	1
more	1
puzzled	1
than	1
ever,	1
and	1
filled	1
with	1
fear	1
and	1
terror;	1
and	1
getting	1
up	1
he	1
put	1
on	1
a	1
pair	1
of	1
slippers	1
because	1
of	1
the	1
dampness	1
of	1
the	1
floor,	1
and	1
without	1
throwing	1
a	1
dressing	1
gown	1
or	1
anything	1
of	1
the	1
kind	1
over	1
him	1
he	1
rushed	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
his	1
room,	1
just	1
in	1
time	1
to	1
see	1
approaching	1
along	1
a	1
corridor	1
a	1
band	1
of	1
more	1
than	1
twenty	1
persons	1
with	1
lighted	1
torches	1
and	1
naked	1
swords	1
in	1
their	1
hands,	1
all	1
shouting	1
out,	1
“To	1
arms,	1
to	1
arms,	1
señor	1
governor,	1
to	1
arms!	1
The	1
enemy	1
is	1
in	1
the	1
island	1
in	1
countless	1
numbers,	1
and	1
we	1
are	1
lost	1
unless	1
your	1
skill	1
and	1
valour	1
come	1
to	1
our	1
support.”	1
Keeping	1
up	1
this	1
noise,	1
tumult,	1
and	1
uproar,	1
they	1
came	1
to	1
where	1
Sancho	1
stood	1
dazed	1
and	1
bewildered	1
by	1
what	1
he	1
saw	1
and	1
heard,	1
and	1
as	1
they	1
approached	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
called	1
out	1
to	1
him,	1
“Arm	1
at	1
once,	1
your	1
lordship,	1
if	1
you	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
yourself	1
destroyed	1
and	1
the	1
whole	1
island	1
lost.”	1
“What	1
have	1
I	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
arming?”	1
said	1
Sancho.	1
“What	1
do	1
I	1
know	1
about	1
arms	1
or	1
supports?	1
Better	1
leave	1
all	1
that	1
to	1
my	1
master	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
who	1
will	1
settle	1
it	1
and	1
make	1
all	1
safe	1
in	1
a	1
trice;	1
for	1
I,	1
sinner	1
that	1
I	1
am,	1
God	1
help	1
me,	1
don’t	1
understand	1
these	1
scuffles.”	1
“Ah,	1
señor	1
governor,”	1
said	1
another,	1
“what	1
slackness	1
of	1
mettle	1
this	1
is!	1
Arm	1
yourself;	1
here	1
are	1
arms	1
for	1
you,	1
offensive	1
and	1
defensive;	1
come	1
out	1
to	1
the	1
plaza	1
and	1
be	1
our	1
leader	1
and	1
captain;	1
it	1
falls	1
upon	1
you	1
by	1
right,	1
for	1
you	1
are	1
our	1
governor.”	1
“Arm	1
me	1
then,	1
in	1
God’s	1
name,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
and	1
they	1
at	1
once	1
produced	1
two	1
large	1
shields	1
they	1
had	1
come	1
provided	1
with,	1
and	1
placed	1
them	1
upon	1
him	1
over	1
his	1
shirt,	1
without	1
letting	1
him	1
put	1
on	1
anything	1
else,	1
one	1
shield	1
in	1
front	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
behind,	1
and	1
passing	1
his	1
arms	1
through	1
openings	1
they	1
had	1
made,	1
they	1
bound	1
him	1
tight	1
with	1
ropes,	1
so	1
that	1
there	1
he	1
was	1
walled	1
and	1
boarded	1
up	1
as	1
straight	1
as	1
a	1
spindle	1
and	1
unable	1
to	1
bend	1
his	1
knees	1
or	1
stir	1
a	1
single	1
step.	1
In	1
his	1
hand	1
they	1
placed	1
a	1
lance,	1
on	1
which	1
he	1
leant	1
to	1
keep	1
himself	1
from	1
falling,	1
and	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
they	1
had	1
him	1
thus	1
fixed	1
they	1
bade	1
him	1
march	1
forward	1
and	1
lead	1
them	1
on	1
and	1
give	1
them	1
all	1
courage;	1
for	1
with	1
him	1
for	1
their	1
guide	1
and	1
lamp	1
and	1
morning	1
star,	1
they	1
were	1
sure	1
to	1
bring	1
their	1
business	1
to	1
a	1
successful	1
issue.	1

“How	1
am	1
I	1
to	1
march,	1
unlucky	1
being	1
that	1
I	1
am?”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“when	1
I	1
can’t	1
stir	1
my	1
knee-caps,	1
for	1
these	1
boards	1
I	1
have	1
bound	1
so	1
tight	1
to	1
my	1
body	1
won’t	1
let	1
me.	1
What	1
you	1
must	1
do	1
is	1
carry	1
me	1
in	1
your	1
arms,	1
and	1
lay	1
me	1
across	1
or	1
set	1
me	1
upright	1
in	1
some	1
postern,	1
and	1
I’ll	1
hold	1
it	1
either	1
with	1
this	1
lance	1
or	1
with	1
my	1
body.”	1
“On,	1
señor	1
governor!”	1
cried	1
another,	1
“it	1
is	1
fear	1
more	1
than	1
the	1
boards	1
that	1
keeps	1
you	1
from	1
moving;	1
make	1
haste,	1
stir	1
yourself,	1
for	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
time	1
to	1
lose;	1
the	1
enemy	1
is	1
increasing	1
in	1
numbers,	1
the	1
shouts	1
grow	1
louder,	1
and	1
the	1
danger	1
is	1
pressing.”	1
Urged	1
by	1
these	1
exhortations	1
and	1
reproaches	1
the	1
poor	1
governor	1
made	1
an	1
attempt	1
to	1
advance,	1
but	1
fell	1
to	1
the	1
ground	1
with	1
such	1
a	1
crash	1
that	1
he	1
fancied	1
he	1
had	1
broken	1
himself	1
all	1
to	1
pieces.	1
There	1
he	1
lay	1
like	1
a	1
tortoise	1
enclosed	1
in	1
its	1
shell,	1
or	1
a	1
side	1
of	1
bacon	1
between	1
two	1
kneading-troughs,	1
or	1
a	1
boat	1
bottom	1
up	1
on	1
the	1
beach;	1
nor	1
did	1
the	1
gang	1
of	1
jokers	1
feel	1
any	1
compassion	1
for	1
him	1
when	1
they	1
saw	1
him	1
down;	1
so	1
far	1
from	1
that,	1
extinguishing	1
their	1
torches	1
they	1
began	1
to	1
shout	1
afresh	1
and	1
to	1
renew	1
the	1
calls	1
to	1
arms	1
with	1
such	1
energy,	1
trampling	1
on	1
poor	1
Sancho,	1
and	1
slashing	1
at	1
him	1
over	1
the	1
shield	1
with	1
their	1
swords	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
way	1
that,	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
gathered	1
himself	1
together	1
and	1
made	1
himself	1
small	1
and	1
drawn	1
in	1
his	1
head	1
between	1
the	1
shields,	1
it	1
would	1
have	1
fared	1
badly	1
with	1
the	1
poor	1
governor,	1
as,	1
squeezed	1
into	1
that	1
narrow	1
compass,	1
he	1
lay,	1
sweating	1
and	1
sweating	1
again,	1
and	1
commending	1
himself	1
with	1
all	1
his	1
heart	1
to	1
God	1
to	1
deliver	1
him	1
from	1
his	1
present	1
peril.	1
Some	1
stumbled	1
over	1
him,	1
others	1
fell	1
upon	1
him,	1
and	1
one	1
there	1
was	1
who	1
took	1
up	1
a	1
position	1
on	1
top	1
of	1
him	1
for	1
some	1
time,	1
and	1
from	1
thence	1
as	1
if	1
from	1
a	1
watchtower	1
issued	1
orders	1
to	1
the	1
troops,	1
shouting	1
out,	1
“Here,	1
our	1
side!	1
Here	1
the	1
enemy	1
is	1
thickest!	1
Hold	1
the	1
breach	1
there!	1
Shut	1
that	1
gate!	1
Barricade	1
those	1
ladders!	1
Here	1
with	1
your	1
stink-pots	1
of	1
pitch	1
and	1
resin,	1
and	1
kettles	1
of	1
boiling	1
oil!	1
Block	1
the	1
streets	1
with	1
feather	1
beds!”	1
In	1
short,	1
in	1
his	1
ardour	1
he	1
mentioned	1
every	1
little	1
thing,	1
and	1
every	1
implement	1
and	1
engine	1
of	1
war	1
by	1
means	1
of	1
which	1
an	1
assault	1
upon	1
a	1
city	1
is	1
warded	1
off,	1
while	1
the	1
bruised	1
and	1
battered	1
Sancho,	1
who	1
heard	1
and	1
suffered	1
all,	1
was	1
saying	1
to	1
himself,	1
“O	1
if	1
it	1
would	1
only	1
please	1
the	1
Lord	1
to	1
let	1
the	1
island	1
be	1
lost	1
at	1
once,	1
and	1
I	1
could	1
see	1
myself	1
either	1
dead	1
or	1
out	1
of	1
this	1
torture!”	1
Heaven	1
heard	1
his	1
prayer,	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
least	1
expected	1
it	1
he	1
heard	1
voices	1
exclaiming,	1
“Victory,	1
victory!	1
The	1
enemy	1
retreats	1
beaten!	1
Come,	1
señor	1
governor,	1
get	1
up,	1
and	1
come	1
and	1
enjoy	1
the	1
victory,	1
and	1
divide	1
the	1
spoils	1
that	1
have	1
been	1
won	1
from	1
the	1
foe	1
by	1
the	1
might	1
of	1
that	1
invincible	1
arm.”	1
“Lift	1
me	1
up,”	1
said	1
the	1
wretched	1
Sancho	1
in	1
a	1
woebegone	1
voice.	1
They	1
helped	1
him	1
to	1
rise,	1
and	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
on	1
his	1
feet	1
said,	1
“The	1
enemy	1
I	1
have	1
beaten	1
you	1
may	1
nail	1
to	1
my	1
forehead;	1
I	1
don’t	1
want	1
to	1
divide	1
the	1
spoils	1
of	1
the	1
foe,	1
I	1
only	1
beg	1
and	1
entreat	1
some	1
friend,	1
if	1
I	1
have	1
one,	1
to	1
give	1
me	1
a	1
sup	1
of	1
wine,	1
for	1
I’m	1
parched	1
with	1
thirst,	1
and	1
wipe	1
me	1
dry,	1
for	1
I’m	1
turning	1
to	1
water.”	1
They	1
rubbed	1
him	1
down,	1
fetched	1
him	1
wine	1
and	1
unbound	1
the	1
shields,	1
and	1
he	1
seated	1
himself	1
upon	1
his	1
bed,	1
and	1
with	1
fear,	1
agitation,	1
and	1
fatigue	1
he	1
fainted	1
away.	1
Those	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
concerned	1
in	1
the	1
joke	1
were	1
now	1
sorry	1
they	1
had	1
pushed	1
it	1
so	1
far;	1
however,	1
the	1
anxiety	1
his	1
fainting	1
away	1
had	1
caused	1
them	1
was	1
relieved	1
by	1
his	1
returning	1
to	1
himself.	1
He	1
asked	1
what	1
o’clock	1
it	1
was;	1
they	1
told	1
him	1
it	1
was	1
just	1
daybreak.	1
He	1
said	1
no	1
more,	1
and	1
in	1
silence	1
began	1
to	1
dress	1
himself,	1
while	1
all	1
watched	1
him,	1
waiting	1
to	1
see	1
what	1
the	1
haste	1
with	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
putting	1
on	1
his	1
clothes	1
meant.	1

He	1
got	1
himself	1
dressed	1
at	1
last,	1
and	1
then,	1
slowly,	1
for	1
he	1
was	1
sorely	1
bruised	1
and	1
could	1
not	1
go	1
fast,	1
he	1
proceeded	1
to	1
the	1
stable,	1
followed	1
by	1
all	1
who	1
were	1
present,	1
and	1
going	1
up	1
to	1
Dapple	1
embraced	1
him	1
and	1
gave	1
him	1
a	1
loving	1
kiss	1
on	1
the	1
forehead,	1
and	1
said	1
to	1
him,	1
not	1
without	1
tears	1
in	1
his	1
eyes,	1
“Come	1
along,	1
comrade	1
and	1
friend	1
and	1
partner	1
of	1
my	1
toils	1
and	1
sorrows;	1
when	1
I	1
was	1
with	1
you	1
and	1
had	1
no	1
cares	1
to	1
trouble	1
me	1
except	1
mending	1
your	1
harness	1
and	1
feeding	1
your	1
little	1
carcass,	1
happy	1
were	1
my	1
hours,	1
my	1
days,	1
and	1
my	1
years;	1
but	1
since	1
I	1
left	1
you,	1
and	1
mounted	1
the	1
towers	1
of	1
ambition	1
and	1
pride,	1
a	1
thousand	1
miseries,	1
a	1
thousand	1
troubles,	1
and	1
four	1
thousand	1
anxieties	1
have	1
entered	1
into	1
my	1
soul;”	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
while	1
he	1
was	1
speaking	1
in	1
this	1
strain	1
he	1
was	1
fixing	1
the	1
pack-saddle	1
on	1
the	1
ass,	1
without	1
a	1
word	1
from	1
anyone.	1
Then	1
having	1
Dapple	1
saddled,	1
he,	1
with	1
great	1
pain	1
and	1
difficulty,	1
got	1
up	1
on	1
him,	1
and	1
addressing	1
himself	1
to	1
the	1
majordomo,	1
the	1
secretary,	1
the	1
head-carver,	1
and	1
Pedro	1
Recio	1
the	1
doctor	1
and	1
several	1
others	1
who	1
stood	1
by,	1
he	1
said,	1
“Make	1
way,	1
gentlemen,	1
and	1
let	1
me	1
go	1
back	1
to	1
my	1
old	1
freedom;	1
let	1
me	1
go	1
look	1
for	1
my	1
past	1
life,	1
and	1
raise	1
myself	1
up	1
from	1
this	1
present	1
death.	1
I	1
was	1
not	1
born	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
governor	1
or	1
protect	1
islands	1
or	1
cities	1
from	1
the	1
enemies	1
that	1
choose	1
to	1
attack	1
them.	1
Ploughing	1
and	1
digging,	1
vinedressing	1
and	1
pruning,	1
are	1
more	1
in	1
my	1
way	1
than	1
defending	1
provinces	1
or	1
kingdoms.	1
Saint	1
Peter	1
is	1
very	1
well	1
at	1
Rome;	1
I	1
mean	1
each	1
of	1
us	1
is	1
best	1
following	1
the	1
trade	1
he	1
was	1
born	1
to.	1
A	1
reaping-hook	1
fits	1
my	1
hand	1
better	1
than	1
a	1
governor’s	1
sceptre;	1
I’d	1
rather	1
have	1
my	1
fill	1
of	1
gazpacho	1
than	1
be	1
subject	1
to	1
the	1
misery	1
of	1
a	1
meddling	1
doctor	1
who	1
kills	1
me	1
with	1
hunger,	1
and	1
I’d	1
rather	1
lie	1
in	1
summer	1
under	1
the	1
shade	1
of	1
an	1
oak,	1
and	1
in	1
winter	1
wrap	1
myself	1
in	1
a	1
double	1
sheepskin	1
jacket	1
in	1
freedom,	1
than	1
go	1
to	1
bed	1
between	1
holland	1
sheets	1
and	1
dress	1
in	1
sables	1
under	1
the	1
restraint	1
of	1
a	1
government.	1
God	1
be	1
with	1
your	1
worships,	1
and	1
tell	1
my	1
lord	1
the	1
duke	1
that	1
‘naked	1
I	1
was	1
born,	1
naked	1
I	1
find	1
myself,	1
I	1
neither	1
lose	1
nor	1
gain;’	1
I	1
mean	1
that	1
without	1
a	1
farthing	1
I	1
came	1
into	1
this	1
government,	1
and	1
without	1
a	1
farthing	1
I	1
go	1
out	1
of	1
it,	1
very	1
different	1
from	1
the	1
way	1
governors	1
commonly	1
leave	1
other	1
islands.	1
Stand	1
aside	1
and	1
let	1
me	1
go;	1
I	1
have	1
to	1
plaster	1
myself,	1
for	1
I	1
believe	1
every	1
one	1
of	1
my	1
ribs	1
is	1
crushed,	1
thanks	1
to	1
the	1
enemies	1
that	1
have	1
been	1
trampling	1
over	1
me	1
to-night.”	1
“That	1
is	1
unnecessary,	1
señor	1
governor,”	1
said	1
Doctor	1
Recio,	1
“for	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
your	1
worship	1
a	1
draught	1
against	1
falls	1
and	1
bruises	1
that	1
will	1
soon	1
make	1
you	1
as	1
sound	1
and	1
strong	1
as	1
ever;	1
and	1
as	1
for	1
your	1
diet	1
I	1
promise	1
your	1
worship	1
to	1
behave	1
better,	1
and	1
let	1
you	1
eat	1
plentifully	1
of	1
whatever	1
you	1
like.”	1
“You	1
spoke	1
late,”	1
said	1
Sancho.	1
“I’d	1
as	1
soon	1
turn	1
Turk	1
as	1
stay	1
any	1
longer.	1
Those	1
jokes	1
won’t	1
pass	1
a	1
second	1
time.	1
By	1
God	1
I’d	1
as	1
soon	1
remain	1
in	1
this	1
government,	1
or	1
take	1
another,	1
even	1
if	1
it	1
was	1
offered	1
me	1
between	1
two	1
plates,	1
as	1
fly	1
to	1
heaven	1
without	1
wings.	1
I	1
am	1
of	1
the	1
breed	1
of	1
the	1
Panzas,	1
and	1
they	1
are	1
every	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
obstinate,	1
and	1
if	1
they	1
once	1
say	1
‘odds,’	1
odds	1
it	1
must	1
be,	1
no	1
matter	1
if	1
it	1
is	1
evens,	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
world.	1
Here	1
in	1
this	1
stable	1
I	1
leave	1
the	1
ant’s	1
wings	1
that	1
lifted	1
me	1
up	1
into	1
the	1
air	1
for	1
the	1
swifts	1
and	1
other	1
birds	1
to	1
eat	1
me,	1
and	1
let’s	1
take	1
to	1
level	1
ground	1
and	1
our	1
feet	1
once	1
more;	1
and	1
if	1
they’re	1
not	1
shod	1
in	1
pinked	1
shoes	1
of	1
cordovan,	1
they	1
won’t	1
want	1
for	1
rough	1
sandals	1
of	1
hemp;	1
‘every	1
ewe	1
to	1
her	1
like,’	1
‘and	1
let	1
no	1
one	1
stretch	1
his	1
leg	1
beyond	1
the	1
length	1
of	1
the	1
sheet;’	1
and	1
now	1
let	1
me	1
pass,	1
for	1
it’s	1
growing	1
late	1
with	1
me.”	1
To	1
this	1
the	1
majordomo	1
said,	1
“Señor	1
governor,	1
we	1
would	1
let	1
your	1
worship	1
go	1
with	1
all	1
our	1
hearts,	1
though	1
it	1
sorely	1
grieves	1
us	1
to	1
lose	1
you,	1
for	1
your	1
wit	1
and	1
Christian	1
conduct	1
naturally	1
make	1
us	1
regret	1
you;	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
well	1
known	1
that	1
every	1
governor,	1
before	1
he	1
leaves	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
he	1
has	1
been	1
governing,	1
is	1
bound	1
first	1
of	1
all	1
to	1
render	1
an	1
account.	1
Let	1
your	1
worship	1
do	1
so	1
for	1
the	1
ten	1
days	1
you	1
have	1
held	1
the	1
government,	1
and	1
then	1
you	1
may	1
go	1
and	1
the	1
peace	1
of	1
God	1
go	1
with	1
you.”	1
“No	1
one	1
can	1
demand	1
it	1
of	1
me,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“but	1
he	1
whom	1
my	1
lord	1
the	1
duke	1
shall	1
appoint;	1
I	1
am	1
going	1
to	1
meet	1
him,	1
and	1
to	1
him	1
I	1
will	1
render	1
an	1
exact	1
one;	1
besides,	1
when	1
I	1
go	1
forth	1
naked	1
as	1
I	1
do,	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
other	1
proof	1
needed	1
to	1
show	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
governed	1
like	1
an	1
angel.”	1
“By	1
God	1
the	1
great	1
Sancho	1
is	1
right,”	1
said	1
Doctor	1
Recio,	1
“and	1
we	1
should	1
let	1
him	1
go,	1
for	1
the	1
duke	1
will	1
be	1
beyond	1
measure	1
glad	1
to	1
see	1
him.”	1
They	1
all	1
agreed	1
to	1
this,	1
and	1
allowed	1
him	1
to	1
go,	1
first	1
offering	1
to	1
bear	1
him	1
company	1
and	1
furnish	1
him	1
with	1
all	1
he	1
wanted	1
for	1
his	1
own	1
comfort	1
or	1
for	1
the	1
journey.	1
Sancho	1
said	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
want	1
anything	1
more	1
than	1
a	1
little	1
barley	1
for	1
Dapple,	1
and	1
half	1
a	1
cheese	1
and	1
half	1
a	1
loaf	1
for	1
himself;	1
for	1
the	1
distance	1
being	1
so	1
short	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
occasion	1
for	1
any	1
better	1
or	1
bulkier	1
provant.	1
They	1
all	1
embraced	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
with	1
tears	1
embraced	1
all	1
of	1
them,	1
and	1
left	1
them	1
filled	1
with	1
admiration	1
not	1
only	1
at	1
his	1
remarks	1
but	1
at	1
his	1
firm	1
and	1
sensible	1
resolution.	1

The	1
duke	1
and	1
duchess	1
resolved	1
that	1
the	1
challenge	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
had,	1
for	1
the	1
reason	1
already	1
mentioned,	1
given	1
their	1
vassal,	1
should	1
be	1
proceeded	1
with;	1
and	1
as	1
the	1
young	1
man	1
was	1
in	1
Flanders,	1
whither	1
he	1
had	1
fled	1
to	1
escape	1
having	1
Doña	1
Rodriguez	1
for	1
a	1
mother-in-law,	1
they	1
arranged	1
to	1
substitute	1
for	1
him	1
a	1
Gascon	1
lacquey,	1
named	1
Tosilos,	1
first	1
of	1
all	1
carefully	1
instructing	1
him	1
in	1
all	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
do.	1
Two	1
days	1
later	1
the	1
duke	1
told	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
that	1
in	1
four	1
days	1
from	1
that	1
time	1
his	1
opponent	1
would	1
present	1
himself	1
on	1
the	1
field	1
of	1
battle	1
armed	1
as	1
a	1
knight,	1
and	1
would	1
maintain	1
that	1
the	1
damsel	1
lied	1
by	1
half	1
a	1
beard,	1
nay	1
a	1
whole	1
beard,	1
if	1
she	1
affirmed	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
given	1
her	1
a	1
promise	1
of	1
marriage.	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
was	1
greatly	1
pleased	1
at	1
the	1
news,	1
and	1
promised	1
himself	1
to	1
do	1
wonders	1
in	1
the	1
lists,	1
and	1
reckoned	1
it	1
rare	1
good	1
fortune	1
that	1
an	1
opportunity	1
should	1
have	1
offered	1
for	1
letting	1
his	1
noble	1
hosts	1
see	1
what	1
the	1
might	1
of	1
his	1
strong	1
arm	1
was	1
capable	1
of;	1
and	1
so	1
in	1
high	1
spirits	1
and	1
satisfaction	1
he	1
awaited	1
the	1
expiration	1
of	1
the	1
four	1
days,	1
which	1
measured	1
by	1
his	1
impatience	1
seemed	1
spinning	1
themselves	1
out	1
into	1
four	1
hundred	1
ages.	1
Let	1
us	1
leave	1
them	1
to	1
pass	1
as	1
we	1
do	1
other	1
things,	1
and	1
go	1
and	1
bear	1
Sancho	1
company,	1
as	1
mounted	1
on	1
Dapple,	1
half	1
glad,	1
half	1
sad,	1
he	1
paced	1
along	1
on	1
his	1
road	1
to	1
join	1
his	1
master,	1
in	1
whose	1
society	1
he	1
was	1
happier	1
than	1
in	1
being	1
governor	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
islands	1
in	1
the	1
world.	1
Well	1
then,	1
it	1
so	1
happened	1
that	1
before	1
he	1
had	1
gone	1
a	1
great	1
way	1
from	1
the	1
island	1
of	1
his	1
government	1
(and	1
whether	1
it	1
was	1
island,	1
city,	1
town,	1
or	1
village	1
that	1
he	1
governed	1
he	1
never	1
troubled	1
himself	1
to	1
inquire)	1
he	1
saw	1
coming	1
along	1
the	1
road	1
he	1
was	1
travelling	1
six	1
pilgrims	1
with	1
staves,	1
foreigners	1
of	1
that	1
sort	1
that	1
beg	1
for	1
alms	1
singing;	1
who	1
as	1
they	1
drew	1
near	1
arranged	1
themselves	1
in	1
a	1
line	1
and	1
lifting	1
up	1
their	1
voices	1
all	1
together	1
began	1
to	1
sing	1
in	1
their	1
own	1
language	1
something	1
that	1
Sancho	1
could	1
not	1
understand,	1
with	1
the	1
exception	1
of	1
one	1
word	1
which	1
sounded	1
plainly	1
“alms,”	1
from	1
which	1
he	1
gathered	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
alms	1
they	1
asked	1
for	1
in	1
their	1
song;	1
and	1
being,	1
as	1
Cide	1
Hamete	1
says,	1
remarkably	1
charitable,	1
he	1
took	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
alforjas	1
the	1
half	1
loaf	1
and	1
half	1
cheese	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
provided	1
with,	1
and	1
gave	1
them	1
to	1
them,	1
explaining	1
to	1
them	1
by	1
signs	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
nothing	1
else	1
to	1
give	1
them.	1
They	1
received	1
them	1
very	1
gladly,	1
but	1
exclaimed,	1
“Geld!	1
Geld!”	1
“I	1
don’t	1
understand	1
what	1
you	1
want	1
of	1
me,	1
good	1
people,”	1
said	1
Sancho.	1
On	1
this	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
took	1
a	1
purse	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
bosom	1
and	1
showed	1
it	1
to	1
Sancho,	1
by	1
which	1
he	1
comprehended	1
they	1
were	1
asking	1
for	1
money,	1
and	1
putting	1
his	1
thumb	1
to	1
his	1
throat	1
and	1
spreading	1
his	1
hand	1
upwards	1
he	1
gave	1
them	1
to	1
understand	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
the	1
sign	1
of	1
a	1
coin	1
about	1
him,	1
and	1
urging	1
Dapple	1
forward	1
he	1
broke	1
through	1
them.	1
But	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
passing,	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
examining	1
him	1
very	1
closely	1
rushed	1
towards	1
him,	1
and	1
flinging	1
his	1
arms	1
round	1
him	1
exclaimed	1
in	1
a	1
loud	1
voice	1
and	1
good	1
Spanish,	1
“God	1
bless	1
me!	1
What’s	1
this	1
I	1
see?	1
Is	1
it	1
possible	1
that	1
I	1
hold	1
in	1
my	1
arms	1
my	1
dear	1
friend,	1
my	1
good	1
neighbour	1
Sancho	1
Panza?	1
But	1
there’s	1
no	1
doubt	1
about	1
it,	1
for	1
I’m	1
not	1
asleep,	1
nor	1
am	1
I	1
drunk	1
just	1
now.”	1
Sancho	1
was	1
surprised	1
to	1
hear	1
himself	1
called	1
by	1
his	1
name	1
and	1
find	1
himself	1
embraced	1
by	1
a	1
foreign	1
pilgrim,	1
and	1
after	1
regarding	1
him	1
steadily	1
without	1
speaking	1
he	1
was	1
still	1
unable	1
to	1
recognise	1
him;	1
but	1
the	1
pilgrim	1
perceiving	1
his	1
perplexity	1
cried,	1
“What!	1
and	1
is	1
it	1
possible,	1
Sancho	1
Panza,	1
that	1
thou	1
dost	1
not	1
know	1
thy	1
neighbour	1
Ricote,	1
the	1
Morisco	1
shopkeeper	1
of	1
thy	1
village?”	1
Sancho	1
upon	1
this	1
looking	1
at	1
him	1
more	1
carefully	1
began	1
to	1
recall	1
his	1
features,	1
and	1
at	1
last	1
recognised	1
him	1
perfectly,	1
and	1
without	1
getting	1
off	1
the	1
ass	1
threw	1
his	1
arms	1
round	1
his	1
neck	1
saying,	1
“Who	1
the	1
devil	1
could	1
have	1
known	1
thee,	1
Ricote,	1
in	1
this	1
mummer’s	1
dress	1
thou	1
art	1
in?	1
Tell	1
me,	1
who	1
has	1
frenchified	1
thee,	1
and	1
how	1
dost	1
thou	1
dare	1
to	1
return	1
to	1
Spain,	1
where	1
if	1
they	1
catch	1
thee	1
and	1
recognise	1
thee	1
it	1
will	1
go	1
hard	1
enough	1
with	1
thee?”	1
“If	1
thou	1
dost	1
not	1
betray	1
me,	1
Sancho,”	1
said	1
the	1
pilgrim,	1
“I	1
am	1
safe;	1
for	1
in	1
this	1
dress	1
no	1
one	1
will	1
recognise	1
me;	1
but	1
let	1
us	1
turn	1
aside	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
road	1
into	1
that	1
grove	1
there	1
where	1
my	1
comrades	1
are	1
going	1
to	1
eat	1
and	1
rest,	1
and	1
thou	1
shalt	1
eat	1
with	1
them	1
there,	1
for	1
they	1
are	1
very	1
good	1
fellows;	1
I’ll	1
have	1
time	1
enough	1
to	1
tell	1
thee	1
then	1
all	1
that	1
has	1
happened	1
me	1
since	1
I	1
left	1
our	1
village	1
in	1
obedience	1
to	1
his	1
Majesty’s	1
edict	1
that	1
threatened	1
such	1
severities	1
against	1
the	1
unfortunate	1
people	1
of	1
my	1
nation,	1
as	1
thou	1
hast	1
heard.”	1
Sancho	1
complied,	1
and	1
Ricote	1
having	1
spoken	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
pilgrims	1
they	1
withdrew	1
to	1
the	1
grove	1
they	1
saw,	1
turning	1
a	1
considerable	1
distance	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
road.	1
They	1
threw	1
down	1
their	1
staves,	1
took	1
off	1
their	1
pilgrim’s	1
cloaks	1
and	1
remained	1
in	1
their	1
under-clothing;	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
good-looking	1
young	1
fellows,	1
except	1
Ricote,	1
who	1
was	1
a	1
man	1
somewhat	1
advanced	1
in	1
years.	1
They	1
carried	1
alforjas	1
all	1
of	1
them,	1
and	1
all	1
apparently	1
well	1
filled,	1
at	1
least	1
with	1
things	1
provocative	1
of	1
thirst,	1
such	1
as	1
would	1
summon	1
it	1
from	1
two	1
leagues	1
off.	1
They	1
stretched	1
themselves	1
on	1
the	1
ground,	1
and	1
making	1
a	1
tablecloth	1
of	1
the	1
grass	1
they	1
spread	1
upon	1
it	1
bread,	1
salt,	1
knives,	1
walnut,	1
scraps	1
of	1
cheese,	1
and	1
well-picked	1
ham-bones	1
which	1
if	1
they	1
were	1
past	1
gnawing	1
were	1
not	1
past	1
sucking.	1
They	1
also	1
put	1
down	1
a	1
black	1
dainty	1
called,	1
they	1
say,	1
caviar,	1
and	1
made	1
of	1
the	1
eggs	1
of	1
fish,	1
a	1
great	1
thirst-wakener.	1
Nor	1
was	1
there	1
any	1
lack	1
of	1
olives,	1
dry,	1
it	1
is	1
true,	1
and	1
without	1
any	1
seasoning,	1
but	1
for	1
all	1
that	1
toothsome	1
and	1
pleasant.	1
But	1
what	1
made	1
the	1
best	1
show	1
in	1
the	1
field	1
of	1
the	1
banquet	1
was	1
half	1
a	1
dozen	1
botas	1
of	1
wine,	1
for	1
each	1
of	1
them	1
produced	1
his	1
own	1
from	1
his	1
alforjas;	1
even	1
the	1
good	1
Ricote,	1
who	1
from	1
a	1
Morisco	1
had	1
transformed	1
himself	1
into	1
a	1
German	1
or	1
Dutchman,	1
took	1
out	1
his,	1
which	1
in	1
size	1
might	1
have	1
vied	1
with	1
the	1
five	1
others.	1
They	1
then	1
began	1
to	1
eat	1
with	1
very	1
great	1
relish	1
and	1
very	1
leisurely,	1
making	1
the	1
most	1
of	1
each	1
morsel—very	1
small	1
ones	1
of	1
everything—they	1
took	1
up	1
on	1
the	1
point	1
of	1
the	1
knife;	1
and	1
then	1
all	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
moment	1
raised	1
their	1
arms	1
and	1
botas	1
aloft,	1
the	1
mouths	1
placed	1
in	1
their	1
mouths,	1
and	1
all	1
eyes	1
fixed	1
on	1
heaven	1
just	1
as	1
if	1
they	1
were	1
taking	1
aim	1
at	1
it;	1
and	1
in	1
this	1
attitude	1
they	1
remained	1
ever	1
so	1
long,	1
wagging	1
their	1
heads	1
from	1
side	1
to	1
side	1
as	1
if	1
in	1
acknowledgment	1
of	1
the	1
pleasure	1
they	1
were	1
enjoying	1
while	1
they	1
decanted	1
the	1
bowels	1
of	1
the	1
bottles	1
into	1
their	1
own	1
stomachs.	1
Sancho	1
beheld	1
all,	1
“and	1
nothing	1
gave	1
him	1
pain;”	1
so	1
far	1
from	1
that,	1
acting	1
on	1
the	1
proverb	1
he	1
knew	1
so	1
well,	1
“when	1
thou	1
art	1
at	1
Rome	1
do	1
as	1
thou	1
seest,”	1
he	1
asked	1
Ricote	1
for	1
his	1
bota	1
and	1
took	1
aim	1
like	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
them,	1
and	1
with	1
not	1
less	1
enjoyment.	1
Four	1
times	1
did	1
the	1
botas	1
bear	1
being	1
uplifted,	1
but	1
the	1
fifth	1
it	1
was	1
all	1
in	1
vain,	1
for	1
they	1
were	1
drier	1
and	1
more	1
sapless	1
than	1
a	1
rush	1
by	1
that	1
time,	1
which	1
made	1
the	1
jollity	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
kept	1
up	1
so	1
far	1
begin	1
to	1
flag.	1
Every	1
now	1
and	1
then	1
someone	1
of	1
them	1
would	1
grasp	1
Sancho’s	1
right	1
hand	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
saying,	1
“Español	1
y	1
Tudesqui	1
tuto	1
uno:	1
bon	1
compaño;”	1
and	1
Sancho	1
would	1
answer,	1
“Bon	1
compaño,	1
jur	1
a	1
Di!”	1
and	1
then	1
go	1
off	1
into	1
a	1
fit	1
of	1
laughter	1
that	1
lasted	1
an	1
hour,	1
without	1
a	1
thought	1
for	1
the	1
moment	1
of	1
anything	1
that	1
had	1
befallen	1
him	1
in	1
his	1
government;	1
for	1
cares	1
have	1
very	1
little	1
sway	1
over	1
us	1
while	1
we	1
are	1
eating	1
and	1
drinking.	1
At	1
length,	1
the	1
wine	1
having	1
come	1
to	1
an	1
end	1
with	1
them,	1
drowsiness	1
began	1
to	1
come	1
over	1
them,	1
and	1
they	1
dropped	1
asleep	1
on	1
their	1
very	1
table	1
and	1
tablecloth.	1
Ricote	1
and	1
Sancho	1
alone	1
remained	1
awake,	1
for	1
they	1
had	1
eaten	1
more	1
and	1
drunk	1
less,	1
and	1
Ricote	1
drawing	1
Sancho	1
aside,	1
they	1
seated	1
themselves	1
at	1
the	1
foot	1
of	1
a	1
beech,	1
leaving	1
the	1
pilgrims	1
buried	1
in	1
sweet	1
sleep;	1
and	1
without	1
once	1
falling	1
into	1
his	1
own	1
Morisco	1
tongue	1
Ricote	1
spoke	1
as	1
follows	1
in	1
pure	1
Castilian:	1
“Thou	1
knowest	1
well,	1
neighbour	1
and	1
friend	1
Sancho	1
Panza,	1
how	1
the	1
proclamation	1
or	1
edict	1
his	1
Majesty	1
commanded	1
to	1
be	1
issued	1
against	1
those	1
of	1
my	1
nation	1
filled	1
us	1
all	1
with	1
terror	1
and	1
dismay;	1
me	1
at	1
least	1
it	1
did,	1
insomuch	1
that	1
I	1
think	1
before	1
the	1
time	1
granted	1
us	1
for	1
quitting	1
Spain	1
was	1
out,	1
the	1
full	1
force	1
of	1
the	1
penalty	1
had	1
already	1
fallen	1
upon	1
me	1
and	1
upon	1
my	1
children.	1
I	1
decided,	1
then,	1
and	1
I	1
think	1
wisely	1
(just	1
like	1
one	1
who	1
knows	1
that	1
at	1
a	1
certain	1
date	1
the	1
house	1
he	1
lives	1
in	1
will	1
be	1
taken	1
from	1
him,	1
and	1
looks	1
out	1
beforehand	1
for	1
another	1
to	1
change	1
into),	1
I	1
decided,	1
I	1
say,	1
to	1
leave	1
the	1
town	1
myself,	1
alone	1
and	1
without	1
my	1
family,	1
and	1
go	1
to	1
seek	1
out	1
some	1
place	1
to	1
remove	1
them	1
to	1
comfortably	1
and	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
hurried	1
way	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
others	1
took	1
their	1
departure;	1
for	1
I	1
saw	1
very	1
plainly,	1
and	1
so	1
did	1
all	1
the	1
older	1
men	1
among	1
us,	1
that	1
the	1
proclamations	1
were	1
not	1
mere	1
threats,	1
as	1
some	1
said,	1
but	1
positive	1
enactments	1
which	1
would	1
be	1
enforced	1
at	1
the	1
appointed	1
time;	1
and	1
what	1
made	1
me	1
believe	1
this	1
was	1
what	1
I	1
knew	1
of	1
the	1
base	1
and	1
extravagant	1
designs	1
which	1
our	1
people	1
harboured,	1
designs	1
of	1
such	1
a	1
nature	1
that	1
I	1
think	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
divine	1
inspiration	1
that	1
moved	1
his	1
Majesty	1
to	1
carry	1
out	1
a	1
resolution	1
so	1
spirited;	1
not	1
that	1
we	1
were	1
all	1
guilty,	1
for	1
some	1
there	1
were	1
true	1
and	1
steadfast	1
Christians;	1
but	1
they	1
were	1
so	1
few	1
that	1
they	1
could	1
make	1
no	1
head	1
against	1
those	1
who	1
were	1
not;	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
prudent	1
to	1
cherish	1
a	1
viper	1
in	1
the	1
bosom	1
by	1
having	1
enemies	1
in	1
the	1
house.	1
In	1
short	1
it	1
was	1
with	1
just	1
cause	1
that	1
we	1
were	1
visited	1
with	1
the	1
penalty	1
of	1
banishment,	1
a	1
mild	1
and	1
lenient	1
one	1
in	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
some,	1
but	1
to	1
us	1
the	1
most	1
terrible	1
that	1
could	1
be	1
inflicted	1
upon	1
us.	1
Wherever	1
we	1
are	1
we	1
weep	1
for	1
Spain;	1
for	1
after	1
all	1
we	1
were	1
born	1
there	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
our	1
natural	1
fatherland.	1
Nowhere	1
do	1
we	1
find	1
the	1
reception	1
our	1
unhappy	1
condition	1
needs;	1
and	1
in	1
Barbary	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
parts	1
of	1
Africa	1
where	1
we	1
counted	1
upon	1
being	1
received,	1
succoured,	1
and	1
welcomed,	1
it	1
is	1
there	1
they	1
insult	1
and	1
ill-treat	1
us	1
most.	1
We	1
knew	1
not	1
our	1
good	1
fortune	1
until	1
we	1
lost	1
it;	1
and	1
such	1
is	1
the	1
longing	1
we	1
almost	1
all	1
of	1
us	1
have	1
to	1
return	1
to	1
Spain,	1
that	1
most	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
like	1
myself	1
know	1
the	1
language,	1
and	1
there	1
are	1
many	1
who	1
do,	1
come	1
back	1
to	1
it	1
and	1
leave	1
their	1
wives	1
and	1
children	1
forsaken	1
yonder,	1
so	1
great	1
is	1
their	1
love	1
for	1
it;	1
and	1
now	1
I	1
know	1
by	1
experience	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
the	1
saying,	1
sweet	1
is	1
the	1
love	1
of	1
one’s	1
country.	1
“I	1
left	1
our	1
village,	1
as	1
I	1
said,	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
France,	1
but	1
though	1
they	1
gave	1
us	1
a	1
kind	1
reception	1
there	1
I	1
was	1
anxious	1
to	1
see	1
all	1
I	1
could.	1
I	1
crossed	1
into	1
Italy,	1
and	1
reached	1
Germany,	1
and	1
there	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
me	1
we	1
might	1
live	1
with	1
more	1
freedom,	1
as	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
do	1
not	1
pay	1
any	1
attention	1
to	1
trifling	1
points;	1
everyone	1
lives	1
as	1
he	1
likes,	1
for	1
in	1
most	1
parts	1
they	1
enjoy	1
liberty	1
of	1
conscience.	1
I	1
took	1
a	1
house	1
in	1
a	1
town	1
near	1
Augsburg,	1
and	1
then	1
joined	1
these	1
pilgrims,	1
who	1
are	1
in	1
the	1
habit	1
of	1
coming	1
to	1
Spain	1
in	1
great	1
numbers	1
every	1
year	1
to	1
visit	1
the	1
shrines	1
there,	1
which	1
they	1
look	1
upon	1
as	1
their	1
Indies	1
and	1
a	1
sure	1
and	1
certain	1
source	1
of	1
gain.	1
They	1
travel	1
nearly	1
all	1
over	1
it,	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
town	1
out	1
of	1
which	1
they	1
do	1
not	1
go	1
full	1
up	1
of	1
meat	1
and	1
drink,	1
as	1
the	1
saying	1
is,	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
real,	1
at	1
least,	1
in	1
money,	1
and	1
they	1
come	1
off	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
their	1
travels	1
with	1
more	1
than	1
a	1
hundred	1
crowns	1
saved,	1
which,	1
changed	1
into	1
gold,	1
they	1
smuggle	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
kingdom	1
either	1
in	1
the	1
hollow	1
of	1
their	1
staves	1
or	1
in	1
the	1
patches	1
of	1
their	1
pilgrim’s	1
cloaks	1
or	1
by	1
some	1
device	1
of	1
their	1
own,	1
and	1
carry	1
to	1
their	1
own	1
country	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
the	1
guards	1
at	1
the	1
posts	1
and	1
passes	1
where	1
they	1
are	1
searched.	1
Now	1
my	1
purpose	1
is,	1
Sancho,	1
to	1
carry	1
away	1
the	1
treasure	1
that	1
I	1
left	1
buried,	1
which,	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
outside	1
the	1
town,	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
do	1
without	1
risk,	1
and	1
to	1
write,	1
or	1
cross	1
over	1
from	1
Valencia,	1
to	1
my	1
daughter	1
and	1
wife,	1
who	1
I	1
know	1
are	1
at	1
Algiers,	1
and	1
find	1
some	1
means	1
of	1
bringing	1
them	1
to	1
some	1
French	1
port	1
and	1
thence	1
to	1
Germany,	1
there	1
to	1
await	1
what	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
God’s	1
will	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
us;	1
for,	1
after	1
all,	1
Sancho,	1
I	1
know	1
well	1
that	1
Ricota	1
my	1
daughter	1
and	1
Francisca	1
Ricota	1
my	1
wife	1
are	1
Catholic	1
Christians,	1
and	1
though	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
so	1
much	1
so,	1
still	1
I	1
am	1
more	1
of	1
a	1
Christian	1
than	1
a	1
Moor,	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
always	1
my	1
prayer	1
to	1
God	1
that	1
he	1
will	1
open	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
my	1
understanding	1
and	1
show	1
me	1
how	1
I	1
am	1
to	1
serve	1
him;	1
but	1
what	1
amazes	1
me	1
and	1
I	1
cannot	1
understand	1
is	1
why	1
my	1
wife	1
and	1
daughter	1
should	1
have	1
gone	1
to	1
Barbary	1
rather	1
than	1
to	1
France,	1
where	1
they	1
could	1
live	1
as	1
Christians.”	1
To	1
this	1
Sancho	1
replied,	1
“Remember,	1
Ricote,	1
that	1
may	1
not	1
have	1
been	1
open	1
to	1
them,	1
for	1
Juan	1
Tiopieyo	1
thy	1
wife’s	1
brother	1
took	1
them,	1
and	1
being	1
a	1
true	1
Moor	1
he	1
went	1
where	1
he	1
could	1
go	1
most	1
easily;	1
and	1
another	1
thing	1
I	1
can	1
tell	1
thee,	1
it	1
is	1
my	1
belief	1
thou	1
art	1
going	1
in	1
vain	1
to	1
look	1
for	1
what	1
thou	1
hast	1
left	1
buried,	1
for	1
we	1
heard	1
they	1
took	1
from	1
thy	1
brother-in-law	1
and	1
thy	1
wife	1
a	1
great	1
quantity	1
of	1
pearls	1
and	1
money	1
in	1
gold	1
which	1
they	1
brought	1
to	1
be	1
passed.”	1
“That	1
may	1
be,”	1
said	1
Ricote;	1
“but	1
I	1
know	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
touch	1
my	1
hoard,	1
for	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
tell	1
them	1
where	1
it	1
was,	1
for	1
fear	1
of	1
accidents;	1
and	1
so,	1
if	1
thou	1
wilt	1
come	1
with	1
me,	1
Sancho,	1
and	1
help	1
me	1
to	1
take	1
it	1
away	1
and	1
conceal	1
it,	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
thee	1
two	1
hundred	1
crowns	1
wherewith	1
thou	1
mayest	1
relieve	1
thy	1
necessities,	1
and,	1
as	1
thou	1
knowest,	1
I	1
know	1
they	1
are	1
many.”	1
“I	1
would	1
do	1
it,”	1
said	1
Sancho;	1
“but	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
covetous,	1
for	1
I	1
gave	1
up	1
an	1
office	1
this	1
morning	1
in	1
which,	1
if	1
I	1
was,	1
I	1
might	1
have	1
made	1
the	1
walls	1
of	1
my	1
house	1
of	1
gold	1
and	1
dined	1
off	1
silver	1
plates	1
before	1
six	1
months	1
were	1
over;	1
and	1
so	1
for	1
this	1
reason,	1
and	1
because	1
I	1
feel	1
I	1
would	1
be	1
guilty	1
of	1
treason	1
to	1
my	1
king	1
if	1
I	1
helped	1
his	1
enemies,	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
go	1
with	1
thee	1
if	1
instead	1
of	1
promising	1
me	1
two	1
hundred	1
crowns	1
thou	1
wert	1
to	1
give	1
me	1
four	1
hundred	1
here	1
in	1
hand.”	1
“And	1
what	1
office	1
is	1
this	1
thou	1
hast	1
given	1
up,	1
Sancho?”	1
asked	1
Ricote.	1
“I	1
have	1
given	1
up	1
being	1
governor	1
of	1
an	1
island,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“and	1
such	1
a	1
one,	1
faith,	1
as	1
you	1
won’t	1
find	1
the	1
like	1
of	1
easily.”	1
“And	1
where	1
is	1
this	1
island?”	1
said	1
Ricote.	1
“Where?”	1
said	1
Sancho;	1
“two	1
leagues	1
from	1
here,	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
called	1
the	1
island	1
of	1
Barataria.”	1
“Nonsense!	1
Sancho,”	1
said	1
Ricote;	1
“islands	1
are	1
away	1
out	1
in	1
the	1
sea;	1
there	1
are	1
no	1
islands	1
on	1
the	1
mainland.”	1
“What?	1
No	1
islands!”	1
said	1
Sancho;	1
“I	1
tell	1
thee,	1
friend	1
Ricote,	1
I	1
left	1
it	1
this	1
morning,	1
and	1
yesterday	1
I	1
was	1
governing	1
there	1
as	1
I	1
pleased	1
like	1
a	1
sagittarius;	1
but	1
for	1
all	1
that	1
I	1
gave	1
it	1
up,	1
for	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
me	1
a	1
dangerous	1
office,	1
a	1
governor’s.”	1
“And	1
what	1
hast	1
thou	1
gained	1
by	1
the	1
government?”	1
asked	1
Ricote.	1
“I	1
have	1
gained,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“the	1
knowledge	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
no	1
good	1
for	1
governing,	1
unless	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
drove	1
of	1
cattle,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
riches	1
that	1
are	1
to	1
be	1
got	1
by	1
these	1
governments	1
are	1
got	1
at	1
the	1
cost	1
of	1
one’s	1
rest	1
and	1
sleep,	1
ay	1
and	1
even	1
one’s	1
food;	1
for	1
in	1
islands	1
the	1
governors	1
must	1
eat	1
little,	1
especially	1
if	1
they	1
have	1
doctors	1
to	1
look	1
after	1
their	1
health.”	1
“I	1
don’t	1
understand	1
thee,	1
Sancho,”	1
said	1
Ricote;	1
“but	1
it	1
seems	1
to	1
me	1
all	1
nonsense	1
thou	1
art	1
talking.	1
Who	1
would	1
give	1
thee	1
islands	1
to	1
govern?	1
Is	1
there	1
any	1
scarcity	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
of	1
cleverer	1
men	1
than	1
thou	1
art	1
for	1
governors?	1
Hold	1
thy	1
peace,	1
Sancho,	1
and	1
come	1
back	1
to	1
thy	1
senses,	1
and	1
consider	1
whether	1
thou	1
wilt	1
come	1
with	1
me	1
as	1
I	1
said	1
to	1
help	1
me	1
to	1
take	1
away	1
treasure	1
I	1
left	1
buried	1
(for	1
indeed	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
called	1
a	1
treasure,	1
it	1
is	1
so	1
large),	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
thee	1
wherewithal	1
to	1
keep	1
thee,	1
as	1
I	1
told	1
thee.”	1
“And	1
I	1
have	1
told	1
thee	1
already,	1
Ricote,	1
that	1
I	1
will	1
not,”	1
said	1
Sancho;	1
“let	1
it	1
content	1
thee	1
that	1
by	1
me	1
thou	1
shalt	1
not	1
be	1
betrayed,	1
and	1
go	1
thy	1
way	1
in	1
God’s	1
name	1
and	1
let	1
me	1
go	1
mine;	1
for	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
well-gotten	1
gain	1
may	1
be	1
lost,	1
but	1
ill-gotten	1
gain	1
is	1
lost,	1
itself	1
and	1
its	1
owner	1
likewise.”	1
“I	1
will	1
not	1
press	1
thee,	1
Sancho,”	1
said	1
Ricote;	1
“but	1
tell	1
me,	1
wert	1
thou	1
in	1
our	1
village	1
when	1
my	1
wife	1
and	1
daughter	1
and	1
brother-in-law	1
left	1
it?”	1
“I	1
was	1
so,”	1
said	1
Sancho;	1
“and	1
I	1
can	1
tell	1
thee	1
thy	1
daughter	1
left	1
it	1
looking	1
so	1
lovely	1
that	1
all	1
the	1
village	1
turned	1
out	1
to	1
see	1
her,	1
and	1
everybody	1
said	1
she	1
was	1
the	1
fairest	1
creature	1
in	1
the	1
world.	1
She	1
wept	1
as	1
she	1
went,	1
and	1
embraced	1
all	1
her	1
friends	1
and	1
acquaintances	1
and	1
those	1
who	1
came	1
out	1
to	1
see	1
her,	1
and	1
she	1
begged	1
them	1
all	1
to	1
commend	1
her	1
to	1
God	1
and	1
Our	1
Lady	1
his	1
mother,	1
and	1
this	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
touching	1
way	1
that	1
it	1
made	1
me	1
weep	1
myself,	1
though	1
I’m	1
not	1
much	1
given	1
to	1
tears	1
commonly;	1
and,	1
faith,	1
many	1
a	1
one	1
would	1
have	1
liked	1
to	1
hide	1
her,	1
or	1
go	1
out	1
and	1
carry	1
her	1
off	1
on	1
the	1
road;	1
but	1
the	1
fear	1
of	1
going	1
against	1
the	1
king’s	1
command	1
kept	1
them	1
back.	1
The	1
one	1
who	1
showed	1
himself	1
most	1
moved	1
was	1
Don	1
Pedro	1
Gregorio,	1
the	1
rich	1
young	1
heir	1
thou	1
knowest	1
of,	1
and	1
they	1
say	1
he	1
was	1
deep	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
her;	1
and	1
since	1
she	1
left	1
he	1
has	1
not	1
been	1
seen	1
in	1
our	1
village	1
again,	1
and	1
we	1
all	1
suspect	1
he	1
has	1
gone	1
after	1
her	1
to	1
steal	1
her	1
away,	1
but	1
so	1
far	1
nothing	1
has	1
been	1
heard	1
of	1
it.”	1
“I	1
always	1
had	1
a	1
suspicion	1
that	1
gentleman	1
had	1
a	1
passion	1
for	1
my	1
daughter,”	1
said	1
Ricote;	1
“but	1
as	1
I	1
felt	1
sure	1
of	1
my	1
Ricota’s	1
virtue	1
it	1
gave	1
me	1
no	1
uneasiness	1
to	1
know	1
that	1
he	1
loved	1
her;	1
for	1
thou	1
must	1
have	1
heard	1
it	1
said,	1
Sancho,	1
that	1
the	1
Morisco	1
women	1
seldom	1
or	1
never	1
engage	1
in	1
amours	1
with	1
the	1
old	1
Christians;	1
and	1
my	1
daughter,	1
who	1
I	1
fancy	1
thought	1
more	1
of	1
being	1
a	1
Christian	1
than	1
of	1
lovemaking,	1
would	1
not	1
trouble	1
herself	1
about	1
the	1
attentions	1
of	1
this	1
heir.”	1
“God	1
grant	1
it,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“for	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
bad	1
business	1
for	1
both	1
of	1
them;	1
but	1
now	1
let	1
me	1
be	1
off,	1
friend	1
Ricote,	1
for	1
I	1
want	1
to	1
reach	1
where	1
my	1
master	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
is	1
to-night.”	1
“God	1
be	1
with	1
thee,	1
brother	1
Sancho,”	1
said	1
Ricote;	1
“my	1
comrades	1
are	1
beginning	1
to	1
stir,	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
time,	1
too,	1
for	1
us	1
to	1
continue	1
our	1
journey;”	1
and	1
then	1
they	1
both	1
embraced,	1
and	1
Sancho	1
mounted	1
Dapple,	1
and	1
Ricote	1
leant	1
upon	1
his	1
staff,	1
and	1
so	1
they	1
parted.	1

ROAD,	1
AND	1
OTHER	1
THINGS	1
THAT	1
CANNOT	1
BE	1

The	1
length	1
of	1
time	1
he	1
delayed	1
with	1
Ricote	1
prevented	1
Sancho	1
from	1
reaching	1
the	1
duke’s	1
castle	1
that	1
day,	1
though	1
he	1
was	1
within	1
half	1
a	1
league	1
of	1
it	1
when	1
night,	1
somewhat	1
dark	1
and	1
cloudy,	1
overtook	1
him.	1
This,	1
however,	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
summer	1
time,	1
did	1
not	1
give	1
him	1
much	1
uneasiness,	1
and	1
he	1
turned	1
aside	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
road	1
intending	1
to	1
wait	1
for	1
morning;	1
but	1
his	1
ill	1
luck	1
and	1
hard	1
fate	1
so	1
willed	1
it	1
that	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
searching	1
about	1
for	1
a	1
place	1
to	1
make	1
himself	1
as	1
comfortable	1
as	1
possible,	1
he	1
and	1
Dapple	1
fell	1
into	1
a	1
deep	1
dark	1
hole	1
that	1
lay	1
among	1
some	1
very	1
old	1
buildings.	1
As	1
he	1
fell	1
he	1
commended	1
himself	1
with	1
all	1
his	1
heart	1
to	1
God,	1
fancying	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
going	1
to	1
stop	1
until	1
he	1
reached	1
the	1
depths	1
of	1
the	1
bottomless	1
pit;	1
but	1
it	1
did	1
not	1
turn	1
out	1
so,	1
for	1
at	1
little	1
more	1
than	1
thrice	1
a	1
man’s	1
height	1
Dapple	1
touched	1
bottom,	1
and	1
he	1
found	1
himself	1
sitting	1
on	1
him	1
without	1
having	1
received	1
any	1
hurt	1
or	1
damage	1
whatever.	1
He	1
felt	1
himself	1
all	1
over	1
and	1
held	1
his	1
breath	1
to	1
try	1
whether	1
he	1
was	1
quite	1
sound	1
or	1
had	1
a	1
hole	1
made	1
in	1
him	1
anywhere,	1
and	1
finding	1
himself	1
all	1
right	1
and	1
whole	1
and	1
in	1
perfect	1
health	1
he	1
was	1
profuse	1
in	1
his	1
thanks	1
to	1
God	1
our	1
Lord	1
for	1
the	1
mercy	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
shown	1
him,	1
for	1
he	1
made	1
sure	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
broken	1
into	1
a	1
thousand	1
pieces.	1
He	1
also	1
felt	1
along	1
the	1
sides	1
of	1
the	1
pit	1
with	1
his	1
hands	1
to	1
see	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
possible	1
to	1
get	1
out	1
of	1
it	1
without	1
help,	1
but	1
he	1
found	1
they	1
were	1
quite	1
smooth	1
and	1
afforded	1
no	1
hold	1
anywhere,	1
at	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
greatly	1
distressed,	1
especially	1
when	1
he	1
heard	1
how	1
pathetically	1
and	1
dolefully	1
Dapple	1
was	1
bemoaning	1
himself,	1
and	1
no	1
wonder	1
he	1
complained,	1
nor	1
was	1
it	1
from	1
ill-temper,	1
for	1
in	1
truth	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
in	1
a	1
very	1
good	1
case.	1
“Alas,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“what	1
unexpected	1
accidents	1
happen	1
at	1
every	1
step	1
to	1
those	1
who	1
live	1
in	1
this	1
miserable	1
world!	1
Who	1
would	1
have	1
said	1
that	1
one	1
who	1
saw	1
himself	1
yesterday	1
sitting	1
on	1
a	1
throne,	1
governor	1
of	1
an	1
island,	1
giving	1
orders	1
to	1
his	1
servants	1
and	1
his	1
vassals,	1
would	1
see	1
himself	1
to-day	1
buried	1
in	1
a	1
pit	1
without	1
a	1
soul	1
to	1
help	1
him,	1
or	1
servant	1
or	1
vassal	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
his	1
relief?	1
Here	1
must	1
we	1
perish	1
with	1
hunger,	1
my	1
ass	1
and	1
myself,	1
if	1
indeed	1
we	1
don’t	1
die	1
first,	1
he	1
of	1
his	1
bruises	1
and	1
injuries,	1
and	1
I	1
of	1
grief	1
and	1
sorrow.	1
At	1
any	1
rate	1
I’ll	1
not	1
be	1
as	1
lucky	1
as	1
my	1
master	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
of	1
La	1
Mancha,	1
when	1
he	1
went	1
down	1
into	1
the	1
cave	1
of	1
that	1
enchanted	1
Montesinos,	1
where	1
he	1
found	1
people	1
to	1
make	1
more	1
of	1
him	1
than	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
house;	1
for	1
it	1
seems	1
he	1
came	1
in	1
for	1
a	1
table	1
laid	1
out	1
and	1
a	1
bed	1
ready	1
made.	1
There	1
he	1
saw	1
fair	1
and	1
pleasant	1
visions,	1
but	1
here	1
I’ll	1
see,	1
I	1
imagine,	1
toads	1
and	1
adders.	1
Unlucky	1
wretch	1
that	1
I	1
am,	1
what	1
an	1
end	1
my	1
follies	1
and	1
fancies	1
have	1
come	1
to!	1
They’ll	1
take	1
up	1
my	1
bones	1
out	1
of	1
this,	1
when	1
it	1
is	1
heaven’s	1
will	1
that	1
I’m	1
found,	1
picked	1
clean,	1
white	1
and	1
polished,	1
and	1
my	1
good	1
Dapple’s	1
with	1
them,	1
and	1
by	1
that,	1
perhaps,	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
found	1
out	1
who	1
we	1
are,	1
at	1
least	1
by	1
such	1
as	1
have	1
heard	1
that	1
Sancho	1
Panza	1
never	1
separated	1
from	1
his	1
ass,	1
nor	1
his	1
ass	1
from	1
Sancho	1
Panza.	1
Unlucky	1
wretches,	1
I	1
say	1
again,	1
that	1
our	1
hard	1
fate	1
should	1
not	1
let	1
us	1
die	1
in	1
our	1
own	1
country	1
and	1
among	1
our	1
own	1
people,	1
where	1
if	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
help	1
for	1
our	1
misfortune,	1
at	1
any	1
rate	1
there	1
would	1
be	1
someone	1
to	1
grieve	1
for	1
it	1
and	1
to	1
close	1
our	1
eyes	1
as	1
we	1
passed	1
away!	1
O	1
comrade	1
and	1
friend,	1
how	1
ill	1
have	1
I	1
repaid	1
thy	1
faithful	1
services!	1
Forgive	1
me,	1
and	1
entreat	1
Fortune,	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
thou	1
canst,	1
to	1
deliver	1
us	1
out	1
of	1
this	1
miserable	1
strait	1
we	1
are	1
both	1
in;	1
and	1
I	1
promise	1
to	1
put	1
a	1
crown	1
of	1
laurel	1
on	1
thy	1
head,	1
and	1
make	1
thee	1
look	1
like	1
a	1
poet	1
laureate,	1
and	1
give	1
thee	1
double	1
feeds.”	1

In	1
this	1
strain	1
did	1
Sancho	1
bewail	1
himself,	1
and	1
his	1
ass	1
listened	1
to	1
him,	1
but	1
answered	1
him	1
never	1
a	1
word,	1
such	1
was	1
the	1
distress	1
and	1
anguish	1
the	1
poor	1
beast	1
found	1
himself	1
in.	1
At	1
length,	1
after	1
a	1
night	1
spent	1
in	1
bitter	1
moanings	1
and	1
lamentations,	1
day	1
came,	1
and	1
by	1
its	1
light	1
Sancho	1
perceived	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
wholly	1
impossible	1
to	1
escape	1
out	1
of	1
that	1
pit	1
without	1
help,	1
and	1
he	1
fell	1
to	1
bemoaning	1
his	1
fate	1
and	1
uttering	1
loud	1
shouts	1
to	1
find	1
out	1
if	1
there	1
was	1
anyone	1
within	1
hearing;	1
but	1
all	1
his	1
shouting	1
was	1
only	1
crying	1
in	1
the	1
wilderness,	1
for	1
there	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
soul	1
anywhere	1
in	1
the	1
neighbourhood	1
to	1
hear	1
him,	1
and	1
then	1
at	1
last	1
he	1
gave	1
himself	1
up	1
for	1
dead.	1
Dapple	1
was	1
lying	1
on	1
his	1
back,	1
and	1
Sancho	1
helped	1
him	1
to	1
his	1
feet,	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
scarcely	1
able	1
to	1
keep;	1
and	1
then	1
taking	1
a	1
piece	1
of	1
bread	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
alforjas	1
which	1
had	1
shared	1
their	1
fortunes	1
in	1
the	1
fall,	1
he	1
gave	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
ass,	1
to	1
whom	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
unwelcome,	1
saying	1
to	1
him	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
understood	1
him,	1
“With	1
bread	1
all	1
sorrows	1
are	1
less.”	1
And	1
now	1
he	1
perceived	1
on	1
one	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
pit	1
a	1
hole	1
large	1
enough	1
to	1
admit	1
a	1
person	1
if	1
he	1
stooped	1
and	1
squeezed	1
himself	1
into	1
a	1
small	1
compass.	1
Sancho	1
made	1
for	1
it,	1
and	1
entered	1
it	1
by	1
creeping,	1
and	1
found	1
it	1
wide	1
and	1
spacious	1
on	1
the	1
inside,	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
able	1
to	1
see	1
as	1
a	1
ray	1
of	1
sunlight	1
that	1
penetrated	1
what	1
might	1
be	1
called	1
the	1
roof	1
showed	1
it	1
all	1
plainly.	1
He	1
observed	1
too	1
that	1
it	1
opened	1
and	1
widened	1
out	1
into	1
another	1
spacious	1
cavity;	1
seeing	1
which	1
he	1
made	1
his	1
way	1
back	1
to	1
where	1
the	1
ass	1
was,	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
stone	1
began	1
to	1
pick	1
away	1
the	1
clay	1
from	1
the	1
hole	1
until	1
in	1
a	1
short	1
time	1
he	1
had	1
made	1
room	1
for	1
the	1
beast	1
to	1
pass	1
easily,	1
and	1
this	1
accomplished,	1
taking	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
halter,	1
he	1
proceeded	1
to	1
traverse	1
the	1
cavern	1
to	1
see	1
if	1
there	1
was	1
any	1
outlet	1
at	1
the	1
other	1
end.	1
He	1
advanced,	1
sometimes	1
in	1
the	1
dark,	1
sometimes	1
without	1
light,	1
but	1
never	1
without	1
fear;	1
“God	1
Almighty	1
help	1
me!”	1
said	1
he	1
to	1
himself;	1
“this	1
that	1
is	1
a	1
misadventure	1
to	1
me	1
would	1
make	1
a	1
good	1
adventure	1
for	1
my	1
master	1
Don	1
Quixote.	1
He	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
sure	1
to	1
take	1
these	1
depths	1
and	1
dungeons	1
for	1
flowery	1
gardens	1
or	1
the	1
palaces	1
of	1
Galiana,	1
and	1
would	1
have	1
counted	1
upon	1
issuing	1
out	1
of	1
this	1
darkness	1
and	1
imprisonment	1
into	1
some	1
blooming	1
meadow;	1
but	1
I,	1
unlucky	1
that	1
I	1
am,	1
hopeless	1
and	1
spiritless,	1
expect	1
at	1
every	1
step	1
another	1
pit	1
deeper	1
than	1
the	1
first	1
to	1
open	1
under	1
my	1
feet	1
and	1
swallow	1
me	1
up	1
for	1
good;	1
‘welcome	1
evil,	1
if	1
thou	1
comest	1
alone.’”	1
In	1
this	1
way	1
and	1
with	1
these	1
reflections	1
he	1
seemed	1
to	1
himself	1
to	1
have	1
travelled	1
rather	1
more	1
than	1
half	1
a	1
league,	1
when	1
at	1
last	1
he	1
perceived	1
a	1
dim	1
light	1
that	1
looked	1
like	1
daylight	1
and	1
found	1
its	1
way	1
in	1
on	1
one	1
side,	1
showing	1
that	1
this	1
road,	1
which	1
appeared	1
to	1
him	1
the	1
road	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
world,	1
led	1
to	1
some	1
opening.	1
Here	1
Cide	1
Hamete	1
leaves	1
him,	1
and	1
returns	1
to	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
who	1
in	1
high	1
spirits	1
and	1
satisfaction	1
was	1
looking	1
forward	1
to	1
the	1
day	1
fixed	1
for	1
the	1
battle	1
he	1
was	1
to	1
fight	1
with	1
him	1
who	1
had	1
robbed	1
Doña	1
Rodriguez’s	1
daughter	1
of	1
her	1
honour,	1
for	1
whom	1
he	1
hoped	1
to	1
obtain	1
satisfaction	1
for	1
the	1
wrong	1
and	1
injury	1
shamefully	1
done	1
to	1
her.	1
It	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
then,	1
that	1
having	1
sallied	1
forth	1
one	1
morning	1
to	1
practise	1
and	1
exercise	1
himself	1
in	1
what	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
to	1
do	1
in	1
the	1
encounter	1
he	1
expected	1
to	1
find	1
himself	1
engaged	1
in	1
the	1
next	1
day,	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
putting	1
Rocinante	1
through	1
his	1
paces	1
or	1
pressing	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
charge,	1
he	1
brought	1
his	1
feet	1
so	1
close	1
to	1
a	1
pit	1
that	1
but	1
for	1
reining	1
him	1
in	1
tightly	1
it	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
impossible	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
avoid	1
falling	1
into	1
it.	1
He	1
pulled	1
him	1
up,	1
however,	1
without	1
a	1
fall,	1
and	1
coming	1
a	1
little	1
closer	1
examined	1
the	1
hole	1
without	1
dismounting;	1
but	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
looking	1
at	1
it	1
he	1
heard	1
loud	1
cries	1
proceeding	1
from	1
it,	1
and	1
by	1
listening	1
attentively	1
was	1
able	1
to	1
make	1
out	1
that	1
he	1
who	1
uttered	1
them	1
was	1
saying,	1
“Ho,	1
above	1
there!	1
is	1
there	1
any	1
Christian	1
that	1
hears	1
me,	1
or	1
any	1
charitable	1
gentleman	1
that	1
will	1
take	1
pity	1
on	1
a	1
sinner	1
buried	1
alive,	1
on	1
an	1
unfortunate	1
disgoverned	1
governor?”	1
It	1
struck	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
Sancho	1
Panza	1
he	1
heard,	1
whereat	1
he	1
was	1
taken	1
aback	1
and	1
amazed,	1
and	1
raising	1
his	1
own	1
voice	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
he	1
could,	1
he	1
cried	1
out,	1
“Who	1
is	1
below	1
there?	1
Who	1
is	1
that	1
complaining?”	1
“Who	1
should	1
be	1
here,	1
or	1
who	1
should	1
complain,”	1
was	1
the	1
answer,	1
“but	1
the	1
forlorn	1
Sancho	1
Panza,	1
for	1
his	1
sins	1
and	1
for	1
his	1
ill-luck	1
governor	1
of	1
the	1
island	1
of	1
Barataria,	1
squire	1
that	1
was	1
to	1
the	1
famous	1
knight	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
of	1
La	1
Mancha?”	1
When	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
heard	1
this	1
his	1
amazement	1
was	1
redoubled	1
and	1
his	1
perturbation	1
grew	1
greater	1
than	1
ever,	1
for	1
it	1
suggested	1
itself	1
to	1
his	1
mind	1
that	1
Sancho	1
must	1
be	1
dead,	1
and	1
that	1
his	1
soul	1
was	1
in	1
torment	1
down	1
there;	1
and	1
carried	1
away	1
by	1
this	1
idea	1
he	1
exclaimed,	1
“I	1
conjure	1
thee	1
by	1
everything	1
that	1
as	1
a	1
Catholic	1
Christian	1
I	1
can	1
conjure	1
thee	1
by,	1
tell	1
me	1
who	1
thou	1
art;	1
and	1
if	1
thou	1
art	1
a	1
soul	1
in	1
torment,	1
tell	1
me	1
what	1
thou	1
wouldst	1
have	1
me	1
do	1
for	1
thee;	1
for	1
as	1
my	1
profession	1
is	1
to	1
give	1
aid	1
and	1
succour	1
to	1
those	1
that	1
need	1
it	1
in	1
this	1
world,	1
it	1
will	1
also	1
extend	1
to	1
aiding	1
and	1
succouring	1
the	1
distressed	1
of	1
the	1
other,	1
who	1
cannot	1
help	1
themselves.”	1
“In	1
that	1
case,”	1
answered	1
the	1
voice,	1
“your	1
worship	1
who	1
speaks	1
to	1
me	1
must	1
be	1
my	1
master	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
of	1
La	1
Mancha;	1
nay,	1
from	1
the	1
tone	1
of	1
the	1
voice	1
it	1
is	1
plain	1
it	1
can	1
be	1
nobody	1
else.”	1
“Don	1
Quixote	1
I	1
am,”	1
replied	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“he	1
whose	1
profession	1
it	1
is	1
to	1
aid	1
and	1
succour	1
the	1
living	1
and	1
the	1
dead	1
in	1
their	1
necessities;	1
wherefore	1
tell	1
me	1
who	1
thou	1
art,	1
for	1
thou	1
art	1
keeping	1
me	1
in	1
suspense;	1
because,	1
if	1
thou	1
art	1
my	1
squire	1
Sancho	1
Panza,	1
and	1
art	1
dead,	1
since	1
the	1
devils	1
have	1
not	1
carried	1
thee	1
off,	1
and	1
thou	1
art	1
by	1
God’s	1
mercy	1
in	1
purgatory,	1
our	1
holy	1
mother	1
the	1
Roman	1
Catholic	1
Church	1
has	1
intercessory	1
means	1
sufficient	1
to	1
release	1
thee	1
from	1
the	1
pains	1
thou	1
art	1
in;	1
and	1
I	1
for	1
my	1
part	1
will	1
plead	1
with	1
her	1
to	1
that	1
end,	1
so	1
far	1
as	1
my	1
substance	1
will	1
go;	1
without	1
further	1
delay,	1
therefore,	1
declare	1
thyself,	1
and	1
tell	1
me	1
who	1
thou	1
art.”	1
“By	1
all	1
that’s	1
good,”	1
was	1
the	1
answer,	1
“and	1
by	1
the	1
birth	1
of	1
whomsoever	1
your	1
worship	1
chooses,	1
I	1
swear,	1
Señor	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
of	1
La	1
Mancha,	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
your	1
squire	1
Sancho	1
Panza,	1
and	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
never	1
died	1
all	1
my	1
life;	1
but	1
that,	1
having	1
given	1
up	1
my	1
government	1
for	1
reasons	1
that	1
would	1
require	1
more	1
time	1
to	1
explain,	1
I	1
fell	1
last	1
night	1
into	1
this	1
pit	1
where	1
I	1
am	1
now,	1
and	1
Dapple	1
is	1
witness	1
and	1
won’t	1
let	1
me	1
lie,	1
for	1
more	1
by	1
token	1
he	1
is	1
here	1
with	1
me.”	1
Nor	1
was	1
this	1
all;	1
one	1
would	1
have	1
fancied	1
the	1
ass	1
understood	1
what	1
Sancho	1
said,	1
because	1
that	1
moment	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
bray	1
so	1
loudly	1
that	1
the	1
whole	1
cave	1
rang	1
again.	1
“Famous	1
testimony!”	1
exclaimed	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
“I	1
know	1
that	1
bray	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
if	1
I	1
was	1
its	1
mother,	1
and	1
thy	1
voice	1
too,	1
my	1
Sancho.	1
Wait	1
while	1
I	1
go	1
to	1
the	1
duke’s	1
castle,	1
which	1
is	1
close	1
by,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
bring	1
someone	1
to	1
take	1
thee	1
out	1
of	1
this	1
pit	1
into	1
which	1
thy	1
sins	1
no	1
doubt	1
have	1
brought	1
thee.”	1
“Go,	1
your	1
worship,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“and	1
come	1
back	1
quick	1
for	1
God’s	1
sake;	1
for	1
I	1
cannot	1
bear	1
being	1
buried	1
alive	1
any	1
longer,	1
and	1
I’m	1
dying	1
of	1
fear.”	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
left	1
him,	1
and	1
hastened	1
to	1
the	1
castle	1
to	1
tell	1
the	1
duke	1
and	1
duchess	1
what	1
had	1
happened	1
Sancho,	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
not	1
a	1
little	1
astonished	1
at	1
it;	1
they	1
could	1
easily	1
understand	1
his	1
having	1
fallen,	1
from	1
the	1
confirmatory	1
circumstance	1
of	1
the	1
cave	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
in	1
existence	1
there	1
from	1
time	1
immemorial;	1
but	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
imagine	1
how	1
he	1
had	1
quitted	1
the	1
government	1
without	1
their	1
receiving	1
any	1
intimation	1
of	1
his	1
coming.	1
To	1
be	1
brief,	1
they	1
fetched	1
ropes	1
and	1
tackle,	1
as	1
the	1
saying	1
is,	1
and	1
by	1
dint	1
of	1
many	1
hands	1
and	1
much	1
labour	1
they	1
drew	1
up	1
Dapple	1
and	1
Sancho	1
Panza	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
darkness	1
into	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
day.	1
A	1
student	1
who	1
saw	1
him	1
remarked,	1
“That’s	1
the	1
way	1
all	1
bad	1
governors	1
should	1
come	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
governments,	1
as	1
this	1
sinner	1
comes	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
depths	1
of	1
the	1
pit,	1
dead	1
with	1
hunger,	1
pale,	1
and	1
I	1
suppose	1
without	1
a	1
farthing.”	1
Sancho	1
overheard	1
him	1
and	1
said,	1
“It	1
is	1
eight	1
or	1
ten	1
days,	1
brother	1
growler,	1
since	1
I	1
entered	1
upon	1
the	1
government	1
of	1
the	1
island	1
they	1
gave	1
me,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
time	1
I	1
never	1
had	1
a	1
bellyful	1
of	1
victuals,	1
no	1
not	1
for	1
an	1
hour;	1
doctors	1
persecuted	1
me	1
and	1
enemies	1
crushed	1
my	1
bones;	1
nor	1
had	1
I	1
any	1
opportunity	1
of	1
taking	1
bribes	1
or	1
levying	1
taxes;	1
and	1
if	1
that	1
be	1
the	1
case,	1
as	1
it	1
is,	1
I	1
don’t	1
deserve,	1
I	1
think,	1
to	1
come	1
out	1
in	1
this	1
fashion;	1
but	1
‘man	1
proposes	1
and	1
God	1
disposes;’	1
and	1
God	1
knows	1
what	1
is	1
best,	1
and	1
what	1
suits	1
each	1
one	1
best;	1
and	1
‘as	1
the	1
occasion,	1
so	1
the	1
behaviour;’	1
and	1
‘let	1
nobody	1
say	1
“I	1
won’t	1
drink	1
of	1
this	1
water;”’	1
and	1
‘where	1
one	1
thinks	1
there	1
are	1
flitches,	1
there	1
are	1
no	1
pegs;’	1
God	1
knows	1
my	1
meaning	1
and	1
that’s	1
enough;	1
I	1
say	1
no	1
more,	1
though	1
I	1
could.”	1
“Be	1
not	1
angry	1
or	1
annoyed	1
at	1
what	1
thou	1
hearest,	1
Sancho,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“or	1
there	1
will	1
never	1
be	1
an	1
end	1
of	1
it;	1
keep	1
a	1
safe	1
conscience	1
and	1
let	1
them	1
say	1
what	1
they	1
like;	1
for	1
trying	1
to	1
stop	1
slanderers’	1
tongues	1
is	1
like	1
trying	1
to	1
put	1
gates	1
to	1
the	1
open	1
plain.	1
If	1
a	1
governor	1
comes	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
government	1
rich,	1
they	1
say	1
he	1
has	1
been	1
a	1
thief;	1
and	1
if	1
he	1
comes	1
out	1
poor,	1
that	1
he	1
has	1
been	1
a	1
noodle	1
and	1
a	1
blockhead.”	1
“They’ll	1
be	1
pretty	1
sure	1
this	1
time,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“to	1
set	1
me	1
down	1
for	1
a	1
fool	1
rather	1
than	1
a	1
thief.”	1
Thus	1
talking,	1
and	1
surrounded	1
by	1
boys	1
and	1
a	1
crowd	1
of	1
people,	1
they	1
reached	1
the	1
castle,	1
where	1
in	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
corridors	1
the	1
duke	1
and	1
duchess	1
stood	1
waiting	1
for	1
them;	1
but	1
Sancho	1
would	1
not	1
go	1
up	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
duke	1
until	1
he	1
had	1
first	1
put	1
up	1
Dapple	1
in	1
the	1
stable,	1
for	1
he	1
said	1
he	1
had	1
passed	1
a	1
very	1
bad	1
night	1
in	1
his	1
last	1
quarters;	1
then	1
he	1
went	1
upstairs	1
to	1
see	1
his	1
lord	1
and	1
lady,	1
and	1
kneeling	1
before	1
them	1
he	1
said,	1
“Because	1
it	1
was	1
your	1
highnesses’	1
pleasure,	1
not	1
because	1
of	1
any	1
desert	1
of	1
my	1
own,	1
I	1
went	1
to	1
govern	1
your	1
island	1
of	1
Barataria,	1
which	1
‘I	1
entered	1
naked,	1
and	1
naked	1
I	1
find	1
myself;	1
I	1
neither	1
lose	1
nor	1
gain.’	1
Whether	1
I	1
have	1
governed	1
well	1
or	1
ill,	1
I	1
have	1
had	1
witnesses	1
who	1
will	1
say	1
what	1
they	1
think	1
fit.	1
I	1
have	1
answered	1
questions,	1
I	1
have	1
decided	1
causes,	1
and	1
always	1
dying	1
of	1
hunger,	1
for	1
Doctor	1
Pedro	1
Recio	1
of	1
Tirteafuera,	1
the	1
island	1
and	1
governor	1
doctor,	1
would	1
have	1
it	1
so.	1
Enemies	1
attacked	1
us	1
by	1
night	1
and	1
put	1
us	1
in	1
a	1
great	1
quandary,	1
but	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
island	1
say	1
they	1
came	1
off	1
safe	1
and	1
victorious	1
by	1
the	1
might	1
of	1
my	1
arm;	1
and	1
may	1
God	1
give	1
them	1
as	1
much	1
health	1
as	1
there’s	1
truth	1
in	1
what	1
they	1
say.	1
In	1
short,	1
during	1
that	1
time	1
I	1
have	1
weighed	1
the	1
cares	1
and	1
responsibilities	1
governing	1
brings	1
with	1
it,	1
and	1
by	1
my	1
reckoning	1
I	1
find	1
my	1
shoulders	1
can’t	1
bear	1
them,	1
nor	1
are	1
they	1
a	1
load	1
for	1
my	1
loins	1
or	1
arrows	1
for	1
my	1
quiver;	1
and	1
so,	1
before	1
the	1
government	1
threw	1
me	1
over	1
I	1
preferred	1
to	1
throw	1
the	1
government	1
over;	1
and	1
yesterday	1
morning	1
I	1
left	1
the	1
island	1
as	1
I	1
found	1
it,	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
streets,	1
houses,	1
and	1
roofs	1
it	1
had	1
when	1
I	1
entered	1
it.	1
I	1
asked	1
no	1
loan	1
of	1
anybody,	1
nor	1
did	1
I	1
try	1
to	1
fill	1
my	1
pocket;	1
and	1
though	1
I	1
meant	1
to	1
make	1
some	1
useful	1
laws,	1
I	1
made	1
hardly	1
any,	1
as	1
I	1
was	1
afraid	1
they	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
kept;	1
for	1
in	1
that	1
case	1
it	1
comes	1
to	1
the	1
same	1
thing	1
to	1
make	1
them	1
or	1
not	1
to	1
make	1
them.	1
I	1
quitted	1
the	1
island,	1
as	1
I	1
said,	1
without	1
any	1
escort	1
except	1
my	1
ass;	1
I	1
fell	1
into	1
a	1
pit,	1
I	1
pushed	1
on	1
through	1
it,	1
until	1
this	1
morning	1
by	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
the	1
sun	1
I	1
saw	1
an	1
outlet,	1
but	1
not	1
so	1
easy	1
a	1
one	1
but	1
that,	1
had	1
not	1
heaven	1
sent	1
me	1
my	1
master	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
I’d	1
have	1
stayed	1
there	1
till	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
world.	1
So	1
now	1
my	1
lord	1
and	1
lady	1
duke	1
and	1
duchess,	1
here	1
is	1
your	1
governor	1
Sancho	1
Panza,	1
who	1
in	1
the	1
bare	1
ten	1
days	1
he	1
has	1
held	1
the	1
government	1
has	1
come	1
by	1
the	1
knowledge	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
give	1
anything	1
to	1
be	1
governor,	1
not	1
to	1
say	1
of	1
an	1
island,	1
but	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
world;	1
and	1
that	1
point	1
being	1
settled,	1
kissing	1
your	1
worships’	1
feet,	1
and	1
imitating	1
the	1
game	1
of	1
the	1
boys	1
when	1
they	1
say,	1
‘leap	1
thou,	1
and	1
give	1
me	1
one,’	1
I	1
take	1
a	1
leap	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
government	1
and	1
pass	1
into	1
the	1
service	1
of	1
my	1
master	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
for	1
after	1
all,	1
though	1
in	1
it	1
I	1
eat	1
my	1
bread	1
in	1
fear	1
and	1
trembling,	1
at	1
any	1
rate	1
I	1
take	1
my	1
fill;	1
and	1
for	1
my	1
part,	1
so	1
long	1
as	1
I’m	1
full,	1
it’s	1
all	1
alike	1
to	1
me	1
whether	1
it’s	1
with	1
carrots	1
or	1
with	1
partridges.”	1
Here	1
Sancho	1
brought	1
his	1
long	1
speech	1
to	1
an	1
end,	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
having	1
been	1
the	1
whole	1
time	1
in	1
dread	1
of	1
his	1
uttering	1
a	1
host	1
of	1
absurdities;	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
found	1
him	1
leave	1
off	1
with	1
so	1
few,	1
he	1
thanked	1
heaven	1
in	1
his	1
heart.	1
The	1
duke	1
embraced	1
Sancho	1
and	1
told	1
him	1
he	1
was	1
heartily	1
sorry	1
he	1
had	1
given	1
up	1
the	1
government	1
so	1
soon,	1
but	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
see	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
provided	1
with	1
some	1
other	1
post	1
on	1
his	1
estate	1
less	1
onerous	1
and	1
more	1
profitable.	1
The	1
duchess	1
also	1
embraced	1
him,	1
and	1
gave	1
orders	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
be	1
taken	1
good	1
care	1
of,	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
plain	1
to	1
see	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
badly	1
treated	1
and	1
worse	1
bruised.	1

The	1
duke	1
and	1
duchess	1
had	1
no	1
reason	1
to	1
regret	1
the	1
joke	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
played	1
upon	1
Sancho	1
Panza	1
in	1
giving	1
him	1
the	1
government;	1
especially	1
as	1
their	1
majordomo	1
returned	1
the	1
same	1
day,	1
and	1
gave	1
them	1
a	1
minute	1
account	1
of	1
almost	1
every	1
word	1
and	1
deed	1
that	1
Sancho	1
uttered	1
or	1
did	1
during	1
the	1
time;	1
and	1
to	1
wind	1
up	1
with,	1
eloquently	1
described	1
to	1
them	1
the	1
attack	1
upon	1
the	1
island	1
and	1
Sancho’s	1
fright	1
and	1
departure,	1
with	1
which	1
they	1
were	1
not	1
a	1
little	1
amused.	1
After	1
this	1
the	1
history	1
goes	1
on	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
the	1
day	1
fixed	1
for	1
the	1
battle	1
arrived,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
duke,	1
after	1
having	1
repeatedly	1
instructed	1
his	1
lacquey	1
Tosilos	1
how	1
to	1
deal	1
with	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
vanquish	1
him	1
without	1
killing	1
or	1
wounding	1
him,	1
gave	1
orders	1
to	1
have	1
the	1
heads	1
removed	1
from	1
the	1
lances,	1
telling	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
that	1
Christian	1
charity,	1
on	1
which	1
he	1
plumed	1
himself,	1
could	1
not	1
suffer	1
the	1
battle	1
to	1
be	1
fought	1
with	1
so	1
much	1
risk	1
and	1
danger	1
to	1
life;	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
must	1
be	1
content	1
with	1
the	1
offer	1
of	1
a	1
battlefield	1
on	1
his	1
territory	1
(though	1
that	1
was	1
against	1
the	1
decree	1
of	1
the	1
holy	1
Council,	1
which	1
prohibits	1
all	1
challenges	1
of	1
the	1
sort)	1
and	1
not	1
push	1
such	1
an	1
arduous	1
venture	1
to	1
its	1
extreme	1
limits.	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
bade	1
his	1
excellence	1
arrange	1
all	1
matters	1
connected	1
with	1
the	1
affair	1
as	1
he	1
pleased,	1
as	1
on	1
his	1
part	1
he	1
would	1
obey	1
him	1
in	1
everything.	1
The	1
dread	1
day,	1
then,	1
having	1
arrived,	1
and	1
the	1
duke	1
having	1
ordered	1
a	1
spacious	1
stand	1
to	1
be	1
erected	1
facing	1
the	1
court	1
of	1
the	1
castle	1
for	1
the	1
judges	1
of	1
the	1
field	1
and	1
the	1
appellant	1
duennas,	1
mother	1
and	1
daughter,	1
vast	1
crowds	1
flocked	1
from	1
all	1
the	1
villages	1
and	1
hamlets	1
of	1
the	1
neighbourhood	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
novel	1
spectacle	1
of	1
the	1
battle;	1
nobody,	1
dead	1
or	1
alive,	1
in	1
those	1
parts	1
having	1
ever	1
seen	1
or	1
heard	1
of	1
such	1
a	1
one.	1
The	1
first	1
person	1
to	1
enter	1
the	1
field	1
and	1
the	1
lists	1
was	1
the	1
master	1
of	1
the	1
ceremonies,	1
who	1
surveyed	1
and	1
paced	1
the	1
whole	1
ground	1
to	1
see	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
nothing	1
unfair	1
and	1
nothing	1
concealed	1
to	1
make	1
the	1
combatants	1
stumble	1
or	1
fall;	1
then	1
the	1
duennas	1
entered	1
and	1
seated	1
themselves,	1
enveloped	1
in	1
mantles	1
covering	1
their	1
eyes,	1
nay	1
even	1
their	1
bosoms,	1
and	1
displaying	1
no	1
slight	1
emotion	1
as	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
appeared	1
in	1
the	1
lists.	1
Shortly	1
afterwards,	1
accompanied	1
by	1
several	1
trumpets	1
and	1
mounted	1
on	1
a	1
powerful	1
steed	1
that	1
threatened	1
to	1
crush	1
the	1
whole	1
place,	1
the	1
great	1
lacquey	1
Tosilos	1
made	1
his	1
appearance	1
on	1
one	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
courtyard	1
with	1
his	1
visor	1
down	1
and	1
stiffly	1
cased	1
in	1
a	1
suit	1
of	1
stout	1
shining	1
armour.	1
The	1
horse	1
was	1
a	1
manifest	1
Frieslander,	1
broad-backed	1
and	1
flea-bitten,	1
and	1
with	1
half	1
a	1
hundred	1
of	1
wool	1
hanging	1
to	1
each	1
of	1
his	1
fetlocks.	1
The	1
gallant	1
combatant	1
came	1
well	1
primed	1
by	1
his	1
master	1
the	1
duke	1
as	1
to	1
how	1
he	1
was	1
to	1
bear	1
himself	1
against	1
the	1
valiant	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
of	1
La	1
Mancha;	1
being	1
warned	1
that	1
he	1
must	1
on	1
no	1
account	1
slay	1
him,	1
but	1
strive	1
to	1
shirk	1
the	1
first	1
encounter	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
avoid	1
the	1
risk	1
of	1
killing	1
him,	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
sure	1
to	1
do	1
if	1
he	1
met	1
him	1
full	1
tilt.	1
He	1
crossed	1
the	1
courtyard	1
at	1
a	1
walk,	1
and	1
coming	1
to	1
where	1
the	1
duennas	1
were	1
placed	1
stopped	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
her	1
who	1
demanded	1
him	1
for	1
a	1
husband;	1
the	1
marshal	1
of	1
the	1
field	1
summoned	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
who	1
had	1
already	1
presented	1
himself	1
in	1
the	1
courtyard,	1
and	1
standing	1
by	1
the	1
side	1
of	1
Tosilos	1
he	1
addressed	1
the	1
duennas,	1
and	1
asked	1
them	1
if	1
they	1
consented	1
that	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
of	1
La	1
Mancha	1
should	1
do	1
battle	1
for	1
their	1
right.	1
They	1
said	1
they	1
did,	1
and	1
that	1
whatever	1
he	1
should	1
do	1
in	1
that	1
behalf	1
they	1
declared	1
rightly	1
done,	1
final	1
and	1
valid.	1
By	1
this	1
time	1
the	1
duke	1
and	1
duchess	1
had	1
taken	1
their	1
places	1
in	1
a	1
gallery	1
commanding	1
the	1
enclosure,	1
which	1
was	1
filled	1
to	1
overflowing	1
with	1
a	1
multitude	1
of	1
people	1
eager	1
to	1
see	1
this	1
perilous	1
and	1
unparalleled	1
encounter.	1
The	1
conditions	1
of	1
the	1
combat	1
were	1
that	1
if	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
proved	1
the	1
victor	1
his	1
antagonist	1
was	1
to	1
marry	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
Doña	1
Rodriguez;	1
but	1
if	1
he	1
should	1
be	1
vanquished	1
his	1
opponent	1
was	1
released	1
from	1
the	1
promise	1
that	1
was	1
claimed	1
against	1
him	1
and	1
from	1
all	1
obligations	1
to	1
give	1
satisfaction.	1
The	1
master	1
of	1
the	1
ceremonies	1
apportioned	1
the	1
sun	1
to	1
them,	1
and	1
stationed	1
them,	1
each	1
on	1
the	1
spot	1
where	1
he	1
was	1
to	1
stand.	1
The	1
drums	1
beat,	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
the	1
trumpets	1
filled	1
the	1
air,	1
the	1
earth	1
trembled	1
under	1
foot,	1
the	1
hearts	1
of	1
the	1
gazing	1
crowd	1
were	1
full	1
of	1
anxiety,	1
some	1
hoping	1
for	1
a	1
happy	1
issue,	1
some	1
apprehensive	1
of	1
an	1
untoward	1
ending	1
to	1
the	1
affair,	1
and	1
lastly,	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
commending	1
himself	1
with	1
all	1
his	1
heart	1
to	1
God	1
our	1
Lord	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
lady	1
Dulcinea	1
del	1
Toboso,	1
stood	1
waiting	1
for	1
them	1
to	1
give	1
the	1
necessary	1
signal	1
for	1
the	1
onset.	1
Our	1
lacquey,	1
however,	1
was	1
thinking	1
of	1
something	1
very	1
different;	1
he	1
only	1
thought	1
of	1
what	1
I	1
am	1
now	1
going	1
to	1
mention.	1
It	1
seems	1
that	1
as	1
he	1
stood	1
contemplating	1
his	1
enemy	1
she	1
struck	1
him	1
as	1
the	1
most	1
beautiful	1
woman	1
he	1
had	1
ever	1
seen	1
all	1
his	1
life;	1
and	1
the	1
little	1
blind	1
boy	1
whom	1
in	1
our	1
streets	1
they	1
commonly	1
call	1
Love	1
had	1
no	1
mind	1
to	1
let	1
slip	1
the	1
chance	1
of	1
triumphing	1
over	1
a	1
lacquey	1
heart,	1
and	1
adding	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
list	1
of	1
his	1
trophies;	1
and	1
so,	1
stealing	1
gently	1
upon	1
him	1
unseen,	1
he	1
drove	1
a	1
dart	1
two	1
yards	1
long	1
into	1
the	1
poor	1
lacquey’s	1
left	1
side	1
and	1
pierced	1
his	1
heart	1
through	1
and	1
through;	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
able	1
to	1
do	1
quite	1
at	1
his	1
ease,	1
for	1
Love	1
is	1
invisible,	1
and	1
comes	1
in	1
and	1
goes	1
out	1
as	1
he	1
likes,	1
without	1
anyone	1
calling	1
him	1
to	1
account	1
for	1
what	1
he	1
does.	1
Well	1
then,	1
when	1
they	1
gave	1
the	1
signal	1
for	1
the	1
onset	1
our	1
lacquey	1
was	1
in	1
an	1
ecstasy,	1
musing	1
upon	1
the	1
beauty	1
of	1
her	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
already	1
made	1
mistress	1
of	1
his	1
liberty,	1
and	1
so	1
he	1
paid	1
no	1
attention	1
to	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
the	1
trumpet,	1
unlike	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
who	1
was	1
off	1
the	1
instant	1
he	1
heard	1
it,	1
and,	1
at	1
the	1
highest	1
speed	1
Rocinante	1
was	1
capable	1
of,	1
set	1
out	1
to	1
meet	1
his	1
enemy,	1
his	1
good	1
squire	1
Sancho	1
shouting	1
lustily	1
as	1
he	1
saw	1
him	1
start,	1
“God	1
guide	1
thee,	1
cream	1
and	1
flower	1
of	1
knights-errant!	1
God	1
give	1
thee	1
the	1
victory,	1
for	1
thou	1
hast	1
the	1
right	1
on	1
thy	1
side!”	1
But	1
though	1
Tosilos	1
saw	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
coming	1
at	1
him	1
he	1
never	1
stirred	1
a	1
step	1
from	1
the	1
spot	1
where	1
he	1
was	1
posted;	1
and	1
instead	1
of	1
doing	1
so	1
called	1
loudly	1
to	1
the	1
marshal	1
of	1
the	1
field,	1
to	1
whom	1
when	1
he	1
came	1
up	1
to	1
see	1
what	1
he	1
wanted	1
he	1
said,	1
“Señor,	1
is	1
not	1
this	1
battle	1
to	1
decide	1
whether	1
I	1
marry	1
or	1
do	1
not	1
marry	1
that	1
lady?”	1
“Just	1
so,”	1
was	1
the	1
answer.	1
“Well	1
then,”	1
said	1
the	1
lacquey,	1
“I	1
feel	1
qualms	1
of	1
conscience,	1
and	1
I	1
should	1
lay	1
a	1
heavy	1
burden	1
upon	1
it	1
if	1
I	1
were	1
to	1
proceed	1
any	1
further	1
with	1
the	1
combat;	1
I	1
therefore	1
declare	1
that	1
I	1
yield	1
myself	1
vanquished,	1
and	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
willing	1
to	1
marry	1
the	1
lady	1
at	1
once.”	1
The	1
marshal	1
of	1
the	1
field	1
was	1
lost	1
in	1
astonishment	1
at	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
Tosilos;	1
and	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
were	1
privy	1
to	1
the	1
arrangement	1
of	1
the	1
affair	1
he	1
knew	1
not	1
what	1
to	1
say	1
in	1
reply.	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
pulled	1
up	1
in	1
mid	1
career	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
that	1
his	1
enemy	1
was	1
not	1
coming	1
on	1
to	1
the	1
attack.	1
The	1
duke	1
could	1
not	1
make	1
out	1
the	1
reason	1
why	1
the	1
battle	1
did	1
not	1
go	1
on;	1
but	1
the	1
marshal	1
of	1
the	1
field	1
hastened	1
to	1
him	1
to	1
let	1
him	1
know	1
what	1
Tosilos	1
said,	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
amazed	1
and	1
extremely	1
angry	1
at	1
it.	1
In	1
the	1
meantime	1
Tosilos	1
advanced	1
to	1
where	1
Doña	1
Rodriguez	1
sat	1
and	1
said	1
in	1
a	1
loud	1
voice,	1
“Señora,	1
I	1
am	1
willing	1
to	1
marry	1
your	1
daughter,	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
wish	1
to	1
obtain	1
by	1
strife	1
and	1
fighting	1
what	1
I	1
can	1
obtain	1
in	1
peace	1
and	1
without	1
any	1
risk	1
to	1
my	1
life.”	1
The	1
valiant	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
heard	1
him,	1
and	1
said,	1
“As	1
that	1
is	1
the	1
case	1
I	1
am	1
released	1
and	1
absolved	1
from	1
my	1
promise;	1
let	1
them	1
marry	1
by	1
all	1
means,	1
and	1
as	1
‘God	1
our	1
Lord	1
has	1
given	1
her,	1
may	1
Saint	1
Peter	1
add	1
his	1
blessing.’”	1
The	1
duke	1
had	1
now	1
descended	1
to	1
the	1
courtyard	1
of	1
the	1
castle,	1
and	1
going	1
up	1
to	1
Tosilos	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
him,	1
“Is	1
it	1
true,	1
sir	1
knight,	1
that	1
you	1
yield	1
yourself	1
vanquished,	1
and	1
that	1
moved	1
by	1
scruples	1
of	1
conscience	1
you	1
wish	1
to	1
marry	1
this	1
damsel?”	1
“It	1
is,	1
señor,”	1
replied	1
Tosilos.	1
“And	1
he	1
does	1
well,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“for	1
what	1
thou	1
hast	1
to	1
give	1
to	1
the	1
mouse,	1
give	1
to	1
the	1
cat,	1
and	1
it	1
will	1
save	1
thee	1
all	1
trouble.”	1
Tosilos	1
meanwhile	1
was	1
trying	1
to	1
unlace	1
his	1
helmet,	1
and	1
he	1
begged	1
them	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
his	1
help	1
at	1
once,	1
as	1
his	1
power	1
of	1
breathing	1
was	1
failing	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
remain	1
so	1
long	1
shut	1
up	1
in	1
that	1
confined	1
space.	1
They	1
removed	1
it	1
in	1
all	1
haste,	1
and	1
his	1
lacquey	1
features	1
were	1
revealed	1
to	1
public	1
gaze.	1
At	1
this	1
sight	1
Doña	1
Rodriguez	1
and	1
her	1
daughter	1
raised	1
a	1
mighty	1
outcry,	1
exclaiming,	1
“This	1
is	1
a	1
trick!	1
This	1
is	1
a	1
trick!	1
They	1
have	1
put	1
Tosilos,	1
my	1
lord	1
the	1
duke’s	1
lacquey,	1
upon	1
us	1
in	1
place	1
of	1
the	1
real	1
husband.	1
The	1
justice	1
of	1
God	1
and	1
the	1
king	1
against	1
such	1
trickery,	1
not	1
to	1
say	1
roguery!”	1
“Do	1
not	1
distress	1
yourselves,	1
ladies,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
“for	1
this	1
is	1
no	1
trickery	1
or	1
roguery;	1
or	1
if	1
it	1
is,	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
the	1
duke	1
who	1
is	1
at	1
the	1
bottom	1
of	1
it,	1
but	1
those	1
wicked	1
enchanters	1
who	1
persecute	1
me,	1
and	1
who,	1
jealous	1
of	1
my	1
reaping	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
this	1
victory,	1
have	1
turned	1
your	1
husband’s	1
features	1
into	1
those	1
of	1
this	1
person,	1
who	1
you	1
say	1
is	1
a	1
lacquey	1
of	1
the	1
duke’s;	1
take	1
my	1
advice,	1
and	1
notwithstanding	1
the	1
malice	1
of	1
my	1
enemies	1
marry	1
him,	1
for	1
beyond	1
a	1
doubt	1
he	1
is	1
the	1
one	1
you	1
wish	1
for	1
a	1
husband.”	1
When	1
the	1
duke	1
heard	1
this	1
all	1
his	1
anger	1
was	1
near	1
vanishing	1
in	1
a	1
fit	1
of	1
laughter,	1
and	1
he	1
said,	1
“The	1
things	1
that	1
happen	1
to	1
Señor	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
are	1
so	1
extraordinary	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
ready	1
to	1
believe	1
this	1
lacquey	1
of	1
mine	1
is	1
not	1
one;	1
but	1
let	1
us	1
adopt	1
this	1
plan	1
and	1
device;	1
let	1
us	1
put	1
off	1
the	1
marriage	1
for,	1
say,	1
a	1
fortnight,	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
keep	1
this	1
person	1
about	1
whom	1
we	1
are	1
uncertain	1
in	1
close	1
confinement,	1
and	1
perhaps	1
in	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
that	1
time	1
he	1
may	1
return	1
to	1
his	1
original	1
shape;	1
for	1
the	1
spite	1
which	1
the	1
enchanters	1
entertain	1
against	1
Señor	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
cannot	1
last	1
so	1
long,	1
especially	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
of	1
so	1
little	1
advantage	1
to	1
them	1
to	1
practise	1
these	1
deceptions	1
and	1
transformations.”	1
“Oh,	1
señor,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“those	1
scoundrels	1
are	1
well	1
used	1
to	1
changing	1
whatever	1
concerns	1
my	1
master	1
from	1
one	1
thing	1
into	1
another.	1
A	1
knight	1
that	1
he	1
overcame	1
some	1
time	1
back,	1
called	1
the	1
Knight	1
of	1
the	1
Mirrors,	1
they	1
turned	1
into	1
the	1
shape	1
of	1
the	1
bachelor	1
Samson	1
Carrasco	1
of	1
our	1
town	1
and	1
a	1
great	1
friend	1
of	1
ours;	1
and	1
my	1
lady	1
Dulcinea	1
del	1
Toboso	1
they	1
have	1
turned	1
into	1
a	1
common	1
country	1
wench;	1
so	1
I	1
suspect	1
this	1
lacquey	1
will	1
have	1
to	1
live	1
and	1
die	1
a	1
lacquey	1
all	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
his	1
life.”	1
Here	1
the	1
Rodriguez’s	1
daughter	1
exclaimed,	1
“Let	1
him	1
be	1
who	1
he	1
may,	1
this	1
man	1
that	1
claims	1
me	1
for	1
a	1
wife;	1
I	1
am	1
thankful	1
to	1
him	1
for	1
the	1
same,	1
for	1
I	1
had	1
rather	1
be	1
the	1
lawful	1
wife	1
of	1
a	1
lacquey	1
than	1
the	1
cheated	1
mistress	1
of	1
a	1
gentleman;	1
though	1
he	1
who	1
played	1
me	1
false	1
is	1
nothing	1
of	1
the	1
kind.”	1
To	1
be	1
brief,	1
all	1
the	1
talk	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
had	1
happened	1
ended	1
in	1
Tosilos	1
being	1
shut	1
up	1
until	1
it	1
was	1
seen	1
how	1
his	1
transformation	1
turned	1
out.	1
All	1
hailed	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
as	1
victor,	1
but	1
the	1
greater	1
number	1
were	1
vexed	1
and	1
disappointed	1
at	1
finding	1
that	1
the	1
combatants	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
so	1
anxiously	1
waiting	1
for	1
had	1
not	1
battered	1
one	1
another	1
to	1
pieces,	1
just	1
as	1
the	1
boys	1
are	1
disappointed	1
when	1
the	1
man	1
they	1
are	1
waiting	1
to	1
see	1
hanged	1
does	1
not	1
come	1
out,	1
because	1
the	1
prosecution	1
or	1
the	1
court	1
has	1
pardoned	1
him.	1
The	1
people	1
dispersed,	1
the	1
duke	1
and	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
returned	1
to	1
the	1
castle,	1
they	1
locked	1
up	1
Tosilos,	1
Doña	1
Rodriguez	1
and	1
her	1
daughter	1
remained	1
perfectly	1
contented	1
when	1
they	1
saw	1
that	1
any	1
way	1
the	1
affair	1
must	1
end	1
in	1
marriage,	1
and	1
Tosilos	1
wanted	1
nothing	1
else.	1

at	1
the	1

that	1
they	1

very	1
sorry	1
he	1
was	1
leaving	1
them.	1

The	1
duchess	1
gave	1
his	1
wife’s	1
letters	1
to	1
Sancho	1
Panza,	1
who	1
shed	1
tears	1
over	1
them,	1
saying,	1
“Who	1
would	1
have	1
thought	1
that	1
such	1
grand	1
hopes	1
as	1
the	1
news	1
of	1
my	1
government	1
bred	1
in	1
my	1
wife	1
Teresa	1
Panza’s	1
breast	1
would	1
end	1
in	1
my	1
going	1
back	1
now	1
to	1
the	1
vagabond	1
adventures	1
of	1
my	1
master	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
of	1
La	1
Mancha?	1
Still	1
I’m	1
glad	1
to	1
see	1
my	1
Teresa	1
behaved	1
as	1
she	1
ought	1
in	1
sending	1
the	1
acorns,	1
for	1
if	1
she	1
had	1
not	1
sent	1
them	1
I’d	1
have	1
been	1
sorry,	1
and	1
she’d	1
have	1
shown	1
herself	1
ungrateful.	1
It	1
is	1
a	1
comfort	1
to	1
me	1
that	1
they	1
can’t	1
call	1
that	1
present	1
a	1
bribe;	1
for	1
I	1
had	1
got	1
the	1
government	1
already	1
when	1
she	1
sent	1
them,	1
and	1
it’s	1
but	1
reasonable	1
that	1
those	1
who	1
have	1
had	1
a	1
good	1
turn	1
done	1
them	1
should	1
show	1
their	1
gratitude,	1
if	1
it’s	1
only	1
with	1
a	1
trifle.	1
After	1
all	1
I	1
went	1
into	1
the	1
government	1
naked,	1
and	1
I	1
come	1
out	1
of	1
it	1
naked;	1
so	1
I	1
can	1
say	1
with	1
a	1
safe	1
conscience—and	1
that’s	1
no	1
small	1
matter—‘naked	1
I	1
was	1
born,	1
naked	1
I	1
find	1
myself,	1
I	1
neither	1
lose	1
nor	1
gain.’”	1
Thus	1
did	1
Sancho	1
soliloquise	1
on	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
their	1
departure,	1
as	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
who	1
had	1
the	1
night	1
before	1
taken	1
leave	1
of	1
the	1
duke	1
and	1
duchess,	1
coming	1
out	1
made	1
his	1
appearance	1
at	1
an	1
early	1
hour	1
in	1
full	1
armour	1
in	1
the	1
courtyard	1
of	1
the	1
castle.	1
The	1
whole	1
household	1
of	1
the	1
castle	1
were	1
watching	1
him	1
from	1
the	1
corridors,	1
and	1
the	1
duke	1
and	1
duchess,	1
too,	1
came	1
out	1
to	1
see	1
him.	1
Sancho	1
was	1
mounted	1
on	1
his	1
Dapple,	1
with	1
his	1
alforjas,	1
valise,	1
and	1
proven	1
supremely	1
happy	1
because	1
the	1
duke’s	1
majordomo,	1
the	1
same	1
that	1
had	1
acted	1
the	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
Trifaldi,	1
had	1
given	1
him	1
a	1
little	1
purse	1
with	1
two	1
hundred	1
gold	1
crowns	1
to	1
meet	1
the	1
necessary	1
expenses	1
of	1
the	1
road,	1
but	1
of	1
this	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
knew	1
nothing	1
as	1
yet.	1
While	1
all	1
were,	1
as	1
has	1
been	1
said,	1
observing	1
him,	1
suddenly	1
from	1
among	1
the	1
duennas	1
and	1
handmaidens	1
the	1
impudent	1
and	1
witty	1
Altisidora	1
lifted	1
up	1
her	1
voice	1
and	1
said	1
in	1
pathetic	1
tones:	1
Give	1
ear,	1
cruel	1
knight;	1
Draw	1
rein;	1
where’s	1
the	1
need	1
Of	1
spurring	1
the	1
flanks	1
Of	1
that	1
ill-broken	1
steed?	1
From	1
what	1
art	1
thou	1
flying?	1
No	1
dragon	1
I	1
am,	1
Not	1
even	1
a	1
sheep,	1
But	1
a	1
tender	1
young	1
lamb.	1
Thou	1
hast	1
jilted	1
a	1
maiden	1
As	1
fair	1
to	1
behold	1
As	1
nymph	1
of	1
Diana	1
Or	1
Venus	1
of	1
old.	1
Bireno,	1
Æneas,	1
what	1
worse	1
shall	1
I	1
call	1
thee?	1
Barabbas	1
go	1
with	1
thee!	1
All	1
evil	1
befall	1
thee!	1
In	1
thy	1
claws,	1
ruthless	1
robber,	1
Thou	1
bearest	1
away	1
The	1
heart	1
of	1
a	1
meek	1
Loving	1
maid	1
for	1
thy	1
prey,	1
Three	1
kerchiefs	1
thou	1
stealest,	1
And	1
garters	1
a	1
pair,	1
From	1
legs	1
than	1
the	1
whitest	1
Of	1
marble	1
more	1
fair;	1
And	1
the	1
sighs	1
that	1
pursue	1
thee	1
Would	1
burn	1
to	1
the	1
ground	1
Two	1
thousand	1
Troy	1
Towns,	1
If	1
so	1
many	1
were	1
found.	1
Bireno,	1
Æneas,	1
what	1
worse	1
shall	1
I	1
call	1
thee?	1
Barabbas	1
go	1
with	1
thee!	1
All	1
evil	1
befall	1
thee!	1
May	1
no	1
bowels	1
of	1
mercy	1
To	1
Sancho	1
be	1
granted,	1
And	1
thy	1
Dulcinea	1
Be	1
left	1
still	1
enchanted,	1
May	1
thy	1
falsehood	1
to	1
me	1
Find	1
its	1
punishment	1
in	1
her,	1
For	1
in	1
my	1
land	1
the	1
just	1
Often	1
pays	1
for	1
the	1
sinner.	1
May	1
thy	1
grandest	1
adventures	1
Discomfitures	1
prove,	1
May	1
thy	1
joys	1
be	1
all	1
dreams,	1
And	1
forgotten	1
thy	1
love.	1
Bireno,	1
Æneas,	1
what	1
worse	1
shall	1
I	1
call	1
thee?	1
Barabbas	1
go	1
with	1
thee!	1
All	1
evil	1
befall	1
thee!	1
May	1
thy	1
name	1
be	1
abhorred	1
For	1
thy	1
conduct	1
to	1
ladies,	1
From	1
London	1
to	1
England,	1
From	1
Seville	1
to	1
Cadiz;	1
May	1
thy	1
cards	1
be	1
unlucky,	1
Thy	1
hands	1
contain	1
ne’er	1
a	1
King,	1
seven,	1
or	1
ace	1
When	1
thou	1
playest	1
primera;	1
When	1
thy	1
corns	1
are	1
cut	1
May	1
it	1
be	1
to	1
the	1
quick;	1
When	1
thy	1
grinders	1
are	1
drawn	1
May	1
the	1
roots	1
of	1
them	1
stick.	1
Bireno,	1
Æneas,	1
what	1
worse	1
shall	1
I	1
call	1
thee?	1
Barabbas	1
go	1
with	1
thee!	1
All	1
evil	1
befall	1
thee!	1
All	1
the	1
while	1
the	1
unhappy	1
Altisidora	1
was	1
bewailing	1
herself	1
in	1
the	1
above	1
strain	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
stood	1
staring	1
at	1
her;	1
and	1
without	1
uttering	1
a	1
word	1
in	1
reply	1
to	1
her	1
he	1
turned	1
round	1
to	1
Sancho	1
and	1
said,	1
“Sancho	1
my	1
friend,	1
I	1
conjure	1
thee	1
by	1
the	1
life	1
of	1
thy	1
forefathers	1
tell	1
me	1
the	1
truth;	1
say,	1
hast	1
thou	1
by	1
any	1
chance	1
taken	1
the	1
three	1
kerchiefs	1
and	1
the	1
garters	1
this	1
love-sick	1
maid	1
speaks	1
of?”	1
To	1
this	1
Sancho	1
made	1
answer,	1
“The	1
three	1
kerchiefs	1
I	1
have;	1
but	1
the	1
garters,	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
‘over	1
the	1
hills	1
of	1
Úbeda.’”	1
The	1
duchess	1
was	1
amazed	1
at	1
Altisidora’s	1
assurance;	1
she	1
knew	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
bold,	1
lively,	1
and	1
impudent,	1
but	1
not	1
so	1
much	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
venture	1
to	1
make	1
free	1
in	1
this	1
fashion;	1
and	1
not	1
being	1
prepared	1
for	1
the	1
joke,	1
her	1
astonishment	1
was	1
all	1
the	1
greater.	1
The	1
duke	1
had	1
a	1
mind	1
to	1
keep	1
up	1
the	1
sport,	1
so	1
he	1
said,	1
“It	1
does	1
not	1
seem	1
to	1
me	1
well	1
done	1
in	1
you,	1
sir	1
knight,	1
that	1
after	1
having	1
received	1
the	1
hospitality	1
that	1
has	1
been	1
offered	1
you	1
in	1
this	1
very	1
castle,	1
you	1
should	1
have	1
ventured	1
to	1
carry	1
off	1
even	1
three	1
kerchiefs,	1
not	1
to	1
say	1
my	1
handmaid’s	1
garters.	1
It	1
shows	1
a	1
bad	1
heart	1
and	1
does	1
not	1
tally	1
with	1
your	1
reputation.	1
Restore	1
her	1
garters,	1
or	1
else	1
I	1
defy	1
you	1
to	1
mortal	1
combat,	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
afraid	1
of	1
rascally	1
enchanters	1
changing	1
or	1
altering	1
my	1
features	1
as	1
they	1
changed	1
his	1
who	1
encountered	1
you	1
into	1
those	1
of	1
my	1
lacquey,	1
Tosilos.”	1
“God	1
forbid,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“that	1
I	1
should	1
draw	1
my	1
sword	1
against	1
your	1
illustrious	1
person	1
from	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
received	1
such	1
great	1
favours.	1
The	1
kerchiefs	1
I	1
will	1
restore,	1
as	1
Sancho	1
says	1
he	1
has	1
them;	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
garters	1
that	1
is	1
impossible,	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
got	1
them,	1
neither	1
has	1
he;	1
and	1
if	1
your	1
handmaiden	1
here	1
will	1
look	1
in	1
her	1
hiding-places,	1
depend	1
upon	1
it	1
she	1
will	1
find	1
them.	1
I	1
have	1
never	1
been	1
a	1
thief,	1
my	1
lord	1
duke,	1
nor	1
do	1
I	1
mean	1
to	1
be	1
so	1
long	1
as	1
I	1
live,	1
if	1
God	1
cease	1
not	1
to	1
have	1
me	1
in	1
his	1
keeping.	1
This	1
damsel	1
by	1
her	1
own	1
confession	1
speaks	1
as	1
one	1
in	1
love,	1
for	1
which	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
to	1
blame,	1
and	1
therefore	1
need	1
not	1
ask	1
pardon,	1
either	1
of	1
her	1
or	1
of	1
your	1
excellence,	1
whom	1
I	1
entreat	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
better	1
opinion	1
of	1
me,	1
and	1
once	1
more	1
to	1
give	1
me	1
leave	1
to	1
pursue	1
my	1
journey.”	1
“And	1
may	1
God	1
so	1
prosper	1
it,	1
Señor	1
Don	1
Quixote,”	1
said	1
the	1
duchess,	1
“that	1
we	1
may	1
always	1
hear	1
good	1
news	1
of	1
your	1
exploits;	1
God	1
speed	1
you;	1
for	1
the	1
longer	1
you	1
stay,	1
the	1
more	1
you	1
inflame	1
the	1
hearts	1
of	1
the	1
damsels	1
who	1
behold	1
you;	1
and	1
as	1
for	1
this	1
one	1
of	1
mine,	1
I	1
will	1
so	1
chastise	1
her	1
that	1
she	1
will	1
not	1
transgress	1
again,	1
either	1
with	1
her	1
eyes	1
or	1
with	1
her	1
words.”	1
“One	1
word	1
and	1
no	1
more,	1
O	1
valiant	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
I	1
ask	1
you	1
to	1
hear,”	1
said	1
Altisidora,	1
“and	1
that	1
is	1
that	1
I	1
beg	1
your	1
pardon	1
about	1
the	1
theft	1
of	1
the	1
garters;	1
for	1
by	1
God	1
and	1
upon	1
my	1
soul	1
I	1
have	1
got	1
them	1
on,	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
fallen	1
into	1
the	1
same	1
blunder	1
as	1
he	1
did	1
who	1
went	1
looking	1
for	1
his	1
ass	1
being	1
all	1
the	1
while	1
mounted	1
on	1
it.”	1
“Didn’t	1
I	1
say	1
so?”	1
said	1
Sancho.	1
“I’m	1
a	1
likely	1
one	1
to	1
hide	1
thefts!	1
Why	1
if	1
I	1
wanted	1
to	1
deal	1
in	1
them,	1
opportunities	1
came	1
ready	1
enough	1
to	1
me	1
in	1
my	1
government.”	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
bowed	1
his	1
head,	1
and	1
saluted	1
the	1
duke	1
and	1
duchess	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
bystanders,	1
and	1
wheeling	1
Rocinante	1
round,	1
Sancho	1
following	1
him	1
on	1
Dapple,	1
he	1
rode	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
castle,	1
shaping	1
his	1
course	1
for	1
Saragossa.	1

When	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
saw	1
himself	1
in	1
open	1
country,	1
free,	1
and	1
relieved	1
from	1
the	1
attentions	1
of	1
Altisidora,	1
he	1
felt	1
at	1
his	1
ease,	1
and	1
in	1
fresh	1
spirits	1
to	1
take	1
up	1
the	1
pursuit	1
of	1
chivalry	1
once	1
more;	1
and	1
turning	1
to	1
Sancho,	1
he	1
said,	1
“Freedom,	1
Sancho,	1
is	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
precious	1
gifts	1
that	1
heaven	1
has	1
bestowed	1
upon	1
men;	1
no	1
treasures	1
that	1
the	1
earth	1
holds	1
buried	1
or	1
the	1
sea	1
conceals	1
can	1
compare	1
with	1
it;	1
for	1
freedom,	1
as	1
for	1
honour,	1
life	1
may	1
and	1
should	1
be	1
ventured;	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
hand,	1
captivity	1
is	1
the	1
greatest	1
evil	1
that	1
can	1
fall	1
to	1
the	1
lot	1
of	1
man.	1
I	1
say	1
this,	1
Sancho,	1
because	1
thou	1
hast	1
seen	1
the	1
good	1
cheer,	1
the	1
abundance	1
we	1
have	1
enjoyed	1
in	1
this	1
castle	1
we	1
are	1
leaving;	1
well	1
then,	1
amid	1
those	1
dainty	1
banquets	1
and	1
snow-cooled	1
beverages	1
I	1
felt	1
as	1
though	1
I	1
were	1
undergoing	1
the	1
straits	1
of	1
hunger,	1
because	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
enjoy	1
them	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
freedom	1
as	1
if	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
mine	1
own;	1
for	1
the	1
sense	1
of	1
being	1
under	1
an	1
obligation	1
to	1
return	1
benefits	1
and	1
favours	1
received	1
is	1
a	1
restraint	1
that	1
checks	1
the	1
independence	1
of	1
the	1
spirit.	1
Happy	1
he,	1
to	1
whom	1
heaven	1
has	1
given	1
a	1
piece	1
of	1
bread	1
for	1
which	1
he	1
is	1
not	1
bound	1
to	1
give	1
thanks	1
to	1
any	1
but	1
heaven	1
itself!”	1
“For	1
all	1
your	1
worship	1
says,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“it	1
is	1
not	1
becoming	1
that	1
there	1
should	1
be	1
no	1
thanks	1
on	1
our	1
part	1
for	1
two	1
hundred	1
gold	1
crowns	1
that	1
the	1
duke’s	1
majordomo	1
has	1
given	1
me	1
in	1
a	1
little	1
purse	1
which	1
I	1
carry	1
next	1
my	1
heart,	1
like	1
a	1
warming	1
plaster	1
or	1
comforter,	1
to	1
meet	1
any	1
chance	1
calls;	1
for	1
we	1
shan’t	1
always	1
find	1
castles	1
where	1
they’ll	1
entertain	1
us;	1
now	1
and	1
then	1
we	1
may	1
light	1
upon	1
roadside	1
inns	1
where	1
they’ll	1
cudgel	1
us.”	1
In	1
conversation	1
of	1
this	1
sort	1
the	1
knight	1
and	1
squire	1
errant	1
were	1
pursuing	1
their	1
journey,	1
when,	1
after	1
they	1
had	1
gone	1
a	1
little	1
more	1
than	1
half	1
a	1
league,	1
they	1
perceived	1
some	1
dozen	1
men	1
dressed	1
like	1
labourers	1
stretched	1
upon	1
their	1
cloaks	1
on	1
the	1
grass	1
of	1
a	1
green	1
meadow	1
eating	1
their	1
dinner.	1
They	1
had	1
beside	1
them	1
what	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
white	1
sheets	1
concealing	1
some	1
objects	1
under	1
them,	1
standing	1
upright	1
or	1
lying	1
flat,	1
and	1
arranged	1
at	1
intervals.	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
approached	1
the	1
diners,	1
and,	1
saluting	1
them	1
courteously	1
first,	1
he	1
asked	1
them	1
what	1
it	1
was	1
those	1
cloths	1
covered.	1
“Señor,”	1
answered	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
party,	1
“under	1
these	1
cloths	1
are	1
some	1
images	1
carved	1
in	1
relief	1
intended	1
for	1
a	1
retablo	1
we	1
are	1
putting	1
up	1
in	1
our	1
village;	1
we	1
carry	1
them	1
covered	1
up	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
not	1
be	1
soiled,	1
and	1
on	1
our	1
shoulders	1
that	1
they	1
may	1
not	1
be	1
broken.”	1
“With	1
your	1
good	1
leave,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“I	1
should	1
like	1
to	1
see	1
them;	1
for	1
images	1
that	1
are	1
carried	1
so	1
carefully	1
no	1
doubt	1
must	1
be	1
fine	1
ones.”	1
“I	1
should	1
think	1
they	1
were!”	1
said	1
the	1
other;	1
“let	1
the	1
money	1
they	1
cost	1
speak	1
for	1
that;	1
for	1
as	1
a	1
matter	1
of	1
fact	1
there	1
is	1
not	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
that	1
does	1
not	1
stand	1
us	1
in	1
more	1
than	1
fifty	1
ducats;	1
and	1
that	1
your	1
worship	1
may	1
judge;	1
wait	1
a	1
moment,	1
and	1
you	1
shall	1
see	1
with	1
your	1
own	1
eyes;”	1
and	1
getting	1
up	1
from	1
his	1
dinner	1
he	1
went	1
and	1
uncovered	1
the	1
first	1
image,	1
which	1
proved	1
to	1
be	1
one	1
of	1
Saint	1
George	1
on	1
horseback	1
with	1
a	1
serpent	1
writhing	1
at	1
his	1
feet	1
and	1
the	1
lance	1
thrust	1
down	1
its	1
throat	1
with	1
all	1
that	1
fierceness	1
that	1
is	1
usually	1
depicted.	1
The	1
whole	1
group	1
was	1
one	1
blaze	1
of	1
gold,	1
as	1
the	1
saying	1
is.	1
On	1
seeing	1
it	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
said,	1
“That	1
knight	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
best	1
knights-errant	1
the	1
army	1
of	1
heaven	1
ever	1
owned;	1
he	1
was	1
called	1
Don	1
Saint	1
George,	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
moreover	1
a	1
defender	1
of	1
maidens.	1
Let	1
us	1
see	1
this	1
next	1
one.”	1
The	1
man	1
uncovered	1
it,	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
seen	1
to	1
be	1
that	1
of	1
Saint	1
Martin	1
on	1
his	1
horse,	1
dividing	1
his	1
cloak	1
with	1
the	1
beggar.	1
The	1
instant	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
saw	1
it	1
he	1
said,	1
“This	1
knight	1
too	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
Christian	1
adventurers,	1
but	1
I	1
believe	1
he	1
was	1
generous	1
rather	1
than	1
valiant,	1
as	1
thou	1
mayest	1
perceive,	1
Sancho,	1
by	1
his	1
dividing	1
his	1
cloak	1
with	1
the	1
beggar	1
and	1
giving	1
him	1
half	1
of	1
it;	1
no	1
doubt	1
it	1
was	1
winter	1
at	1
the	1
time,	1
for	1
otherwise	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
given	1
him	1
the	1
whole	1
of	1
it,	1
so	1
charitable	1
was	1
he.”	1
“It	1
was	1
not	1
that,	1
most	1
likely,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“but	1
that	1
he	1
held	1
with	1
the	1
proverb	1
that	1
says,	1
‘For	1
giving	1
and	1
keeping	1
there’s	1
need	1
of	1
brains.’”	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
laughed,	1
and	1
asked	1
them	1
to	1
take	1
off	1
the	1
next	1
cloth,	1
underneath	1
which	1
was	1
seen	1
the	1
image	1
of	1
the	1
patron	1
saint	1
of	1
the	1
Spains	1
seated	1
on	1
horseback,	1
his	1
sword	1
stained	1
with	1
blood,	1
trampling	1
on	1
Moors	1
and	1
treading	1
heads	1
underfoot;	1
and	1
on	1
seeing	1
it	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
exclaimed,	1
“Ay,	1
this	1
is	1
a	1
knight,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
squadrons	1
of	1
Christ!	1
This	1
one	1
is	1
called	1
Don	1
Saint	1
James	1
the	1
Moorslayer,	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
bravest	1
saints	1
and	1
knights	1
the	1
world	1
ever	1
had	1
or	1
heaven	1
has	1
now.”	1
They	1
then	1
raised	1
another	1
cloth	1
which	1
it	1
appeared	1
covered	1
Saint	1
Paul	1
falling	1
from	1
his	1
horse,	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
details	1
that	1
are	1
usually	1
given	1
in	1
representations	1
of	1
his	1
conversion.	1
When	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
saw	1
it,	1
rendered	1
in	1
such	1
lifelike	1
style	1
that	1
one	1
would	1
have	1
said	1
Christ	1
was	1
speaking	1
and	1
Paul	1
answering,	1
“This,”	1
he	1
said,	1
“was	1
in	1
his	1
time	1
the	1
greatest	1
enemy	1
that	1
the	1
Church	1
of	1
God	1
our	1
Lord	1
had,	1
and	1
the	1
greatest	1
champion	1
it	1
will	1
ever	1
have;	1
a	1
knight-errant	1
in	1
life,	1
a	1
steadfast	1
saint	1
in	1
death,	1
an	1
untiring	1
labourer	1
in	1
the	1
Lord’s	1
vineyard,	1
a	1
teacher	1
of	1
the	1
Gentiles,	1
whose	1
school	1
was	1
heaven,	1
and	1
whose	1
instructor	1
and	1
master	1
was	1
Jesus	1
Christ	1
himself.”	1
There	1
were	1
no	1
more	1
images,	1
so	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
bade	1
them	1
cover	1
them	1
up	1
again,	1
and	1
said	1
to	1
those	1
who	1
had	1
brought	1
them,	1
“I	1
take	1
it	1
as	1
a	1
happy	1
omen,	1
brothers,	1
to	1
have	1
seen	1
what	1
I	1
have;	1
for	1
these	1
saints	1
and	1
knights	1
were	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
profession	1
as	1
myself,	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
calling	1
of	1
arms;	1
only	1
there	1
is	1
this	1
difference	1
between	1
them	1
and	1
me,	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
saints,	1
and	1
fought	1
with	1
divine	1
weapons,	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
sinner	1
and	1
fight	1
with	1
human	1
ones.	1
They	1
won	1
heaven	1
by	1
force	1
of	1
arms,	1
for	1
heaven	1
suffereth	1
violence;	1
and	1
I,	1
so	1
far,	1
know	1
not	1
what	1
I	1
have	1
won	1
by	1
dint	1
of	1
my	1
sufferings;	1
but	1
if	1
my	1
Dulcinea	1
del	1
Toboso	1
were	1
to	1
be	1
released	1
from	1
hers,	1
perhaps	1
with	1
mended	1
fortunes	1
and	1
a	1
mind	1
restored	1
to	1
itself	1
I	1
might	1
direct	1
my	1
steps	1
in	1
a	1
better	1
path	1
than	1
I	1
am	1
following	1
at	1
present.”	1
“May	1
God	1
hear	1
and	1
sin	1
be	1
deaf,”	1
said	1
Sancho	1
to	1
this.	1
The	1
men	1
were	1
filled	1
with	1
wonder,	1
as	1
well	1
at	1
the	1
figure	1
as	1
at	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
though	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
understand	1
one	1
half	1
of	1
what	1
he	1
meant	1
by	1
them.	1
They	1
finished	1
their	1
dinner,	1
took	1
their	1
images	1
on	1
their	1
backs,	1
and	1
bidding	1
farewell	1
to	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
resumed	1
their	1
journey.	1
Sancho	1
was	1
amazed	1
afresh	1
at	1
the	1
extent	1
of	1
his	1
master’s	1
knowledge,	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
never	1
known	1
him,	1
for	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
story	1
or	1
event	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
at	1
his	1
fingers’	1
ends	1
and	1
fixed	1
in	1
his	1
memory,	1
and	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
him,	1
“In	1
truth,	1
master	1
mine,	1
if	1
this	1
that	1
has	1
happened	1
to	1
us	1
to-day	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
called	1
an	1
adventure,	1
it	1
has	1
been	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
sweetest	1
and	1
pleasantest	1
that	1
have	1
befallen	1
us	1
in	1
the	1
whole	1
course	1
of	1
our	1
travels;	1
we	1
have	1
come	1
out	1
of	1
it	1
unbelaboured	1
and	1
undismayed,	1
neither	1
have	1
we	1
drawn	1
sword	1
nor	1
have	1
we	1
smitten	1
the	1
earth	1
with	1
our	1
bodies,	1
nor	1
have	1
we	1
been	1
left	1
famishing;	1
blessed	1
be	1
God	1
that	1
he	1
has	1
let	1
me	1
see	1
such	1
a	1
thing	1
with	1
my	1
own	1
eyes!”	1
“Thou	1
sayest	1
well,	1
Sancho,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“but	1
remember	1
all	1
times	1
are	1
not	1
alike	1
nor	1
do	1
they	1
always	1
run	1
the	1
same	1
way;	1
and	1
these	1
things	1
the	1
vulgar	1
commonly	1
call	1
omens,	1
which	1
are	1
not	1
based	1
upon	1
any	1
natural	1
reason,	1
will	1
by	1
him	1
who	1
is	1
wise	1
be	1
esteemed	1
and	1
reckoned	1
happy	1
accidents	1
merely.	1
One	1
of	1
these	1
believers	1
in	1
omens	1
will	1
get	1
up	1
of	1
a	1
morning,	1
leave	1
his	1
house,	1
and	1
meet	1
a	1
friar	1
of	1
the	1
order	1
of	1
the	1
blessed	1
Saint	1
Francis,	1
and,	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
met	1
a	1
griffin,	1
he	1
will	1
turn	1
about	1
and	1
go	1
home.	1
With	1
another	1
Mendoza	1
the	1
salt	1
is	1
spilt	1
on	1
his	1
table,	1
and	1
gloom	1
is	1
spilt	1
over	1
his	1
heart,	1
as	1
if	1
nature	1
was	1
obliged	1
to	1
give	1
warning	1
of	1
coming	1
misfortunes	1
by	1
means	1
of	1
such	1
trivial	1
things	1
as	1
these.	1
The	1
wise	1
man	1
and	1
the	1
Christian	1
should	1
not	1
trifle	1
with	1
what	1
it	1
may	1
please	1
heaven	1
to	1
do.	1
Scipio	1
on	1
coming	1
to	1
Africa	1
stumbled	1
as	1
he	1
leaped	1
on	1
shore;	1
his	1
soldiers	1
took	1
it	1
as	1
a	1
bad	1
omen;	1
but	1
he,	1
clasping	1
the	1
soil	1
with	1
his	1
arms,	1
exclaimed,	1
‘Thou	1
canst	1
not	1
escape	1
me,	1
Africa,	1
for	1
I	1
hold	1
thee	1
tight	1
between	1
my	1
arms.’	1
Thus,	1
Sancho,	1
meeting	1
those	1
images	1
has	1
been	1
to	1
me	1
a	1
most	1
happy	1
occurrence.”	1
“I	1
can	1
well	1
believe	1
it,”	1
said	1
Sancho;	1
“but	1
I	1
wish	1
your	1
worship	1
would	1
tell	1
me	1
what	1
is	1
the	1
reason	1
that	1
the	1
Spaniards,	1
when	1
they	1
are	1
about	1
to	1
give	1
battle,	1
in	1
calling	1
on	1
that	1
Saint	1
James	1
the	1
Moorslayer,	1
say	1
‘Santiago	1
and	1
close	1
Spain!’	1
Is	1
Spain,	1
then,	1
open,	1
so	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
needful	1
to	1
close	1
it;	1
or	1
what	1
is	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
this	1
form?”	1
“Thou	1
art	1
very	1
simple,	1
Sancho,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
“God,	1
look	1
you,	1
gave	1
that	1
great	1
knight	1
of	1
the	1
Red	1
Cross	1
to	1
Spain	1
as	1
her	1
patron	1
saint	1
and	1
protector,	1
especially	1
in	1
those	1
hard	1
struggles	1
the	1
Spaniards	1
had	1
with	1
the	1
Moors;	1
and	1
therefore	1
they	1
invoke	1
and	1
call	1
upon	1
him	1
as	1
their	1
defender	1
in	1
all	1
their	1
battles;	1
and	1
in	1
these	1
he	1
has	1
been	1
many	1
a	1
time	1
seen	1
beating	1
down,	1
trampling	1
under	1
foot,	1
destroying	1
and	1
slaughtering	1
the	1
Hagarene	1
squadrons	1
in	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
all;	1
of	1
which	1
fact	1
I	1
could	1
give	1
thee	1
many	1
examples	1
recorded	1
in	1
truthful	1
Spanish	1
histories.”	1
Sancho	1
changed	1
the	1
subject,	1
and	1
said	1
to	1
his	1
master,	1
“I	1
marvel,	1
señor,	1
at	1
the	1
boldness	1
of	1
Altisidora,	1
the	1
duchess’s	1
handmaid;	1
he	1
whom	1
they	1
call	1
Love	1
must	1
have	1
cruelly	1
pierced	1
and	1
wounded	1
her;	1
they	1
say	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
little	1
blind	1
urchin	1
who,	1
though	1
blear-eyed,	1
or	1
more	1
properly	1
speaking	1
sightless,	1
if	1
he	1
aims	1
at	1
a	1
heart,	1
be	1
it	1
ever	1
so	1
small,	1
hits	1
it	1
and	1
pierces	1
it	1
through	1
and	1
through	1
with	1
his	1
arrows.	1
I	1
have	1
heard	1
it	1
said	1
too	1
that	1
the	1
arrows	1
of	1
Love	1
are	1
blunted	1
and	1
robbed	1
of	1
their	1
points	1
by	1
maidenly	1
modesty	1
and	1
reserve;	1
but	1
with	1
this	1
Altisidora	1
it	1
seems	1
they	1
are	1
sharpened	1
rather	1
than	1
blunted.”	1
“Bear	1
in	1
mind,	1
Sancho,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“that	1
love	1
is	1
influenced	1
by	1
no	1
consideration,	1
recognises	1
no	1
restraints	1
of	1
reason,	1
and	1
is	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
nature	1
as	1
death,	1
that	1
assails	1
alike	1
the	1
lofty	1
palaces	1
of	1
kings	1
and	1
the	1
humble	1
cabins	1
of	1
shepherds;	1
and	1
when	1
it	1
takes	1
entire	1
possession	1
of	1
a	1
heart,	1
the	1
first	1
thing	1
it	1
does	1
is	1
to	1
banish	1
fear	1
and	1
shame	1
from	1
it;	1
and	1
so	1
without	1
shame	1
Altisidora	1
declared	1
her	1
passion,	1
which	1
excited	1
in	1
my	1
mind	1
embarrassment	1
rather	1
than	1
commiseration.”	1
“Notable	1
cruelty!”	1
exclaimed	1
Sancho;	1
“unheard-of	1
ingratitude!	1
I	1
can	1
only	1
say	1
for	1
myself	1
that	1
the	1
very	1
smallest	1
loving	1
word	1
of	1
hers	1
would	1
have	1
subdued	1
me	1
and	1
made	1
a	1
slave	1
of	1
me.	1
The	1
devil!	1
What	1
a	1
heart	1
of	1
marble,	1
what	1
bowels	1
of	1
brass,	1
what	1
a	1
soul	1
of	1
mortar!	1
But	1
I	1
can’t	1
imagine	1
what	1
it	1
is	1
that	1
this	1
damsel	1
saw	1
in	1
your	1
worship	1
that	1
could	1
have	1
conquered	1
and	1
captivated	1
her	1
so.	1
What	1
gallant	1
figure	1
was	1
it,	1
what	1
bold	1
bearing,	1
what	1
sprightly	1
grace,	1
what	1
comeliness	1
of	1
feature,	1
which	1
of	1
these	1
things	1
by	1
itself,	1
or	1
what	1
all	1
together,	1
could	1
have	1
made	1
her	1
fall	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
you?	1
For	1
indeed	1
and	1
in	1
truth	1
many	1
a	1
time	1
I	1
stop	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
your	1
worship	1
from	1
the	1
sole	1
of	1
your	1
foot	1
to	1
the	1
topmost	1
hair	1
of	1
your	1
head,	1
and	1
I	1
see	1
more	1
to	1
frighten	1
one	1
than	1
to	1
make	1
one	1
fall	1
in	1
love;	1
moreover	1
I	1
have	1
heard	1
say	1
that	1
beauty	1
is	1
the	1
first	1
and	1
main	1
thing	1
that	1
excites	1
love,	1
and	1
as	1
your	1
worship	1
has	1
none	1
at	1
all,	1
I	1
don’t	1
know	1
what	1
the	1
poor	1
creature	1
fell	1
in	1
love	1
with.”	1
“Recollect,	1
Sancho,”	1
replied	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“there	1
are	1
two	1
sorts	1
of	1
beauty,	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
mind,	1
the	1
other	1
of	1
the	1
body;	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
mind	1
displays	1
and	1
exhibits	1
itself	1
in	1
intelligence,	1
in	1
modesty,	1
in	1
honourable	1
conduct,	1
in	1
generosity,	1
in	1
good	1
breeding;	1
and	1
all	1
these	1
qualities	1
are	1
possible	1
and	1
may	1
exist	1
in	1
an	1
ugly	1
man;	1
and	1
when	1
it	1
is	1
this	1
sort	1
of	1
beauty	1
and	1
not	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
body	1
that	1
is	1
the	1
attraction,	1
love	1
is	1
apt	1
to	1
spring	1
up	1
suddenly	1
and	1
violently.	1
I,	1
Sancho,	1
perceive	1
clearly	1
enough	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
beautiful,	1
but	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
I	1
know	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
hideous;	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
enough	1
for	1
an	1
honest	1
man	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
monster	1
to	1
be	1
an	1
object	1
of	1
love,	1
if	1
only	1
he	1
possesses	1
the	1
endowments	1
of	1
mind	1
I	1
have	1
mentioned.”	1
While	1
engaged	1
in	1
this	1
discourse	1
they	1
were	1
making	1
their	1
way	1
through	1
a	1
wood	1
that	1
lay	1
beyond	1
the	1
road,	1
when	1
suddenly,	1
without	1
expecting	1
anything	1
of	1
the	1
kind,	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
found	1
himself	1
caught	1
in	1
some	1
nets	1
of	1
green	1
cord	1
stretched	1
from	1
one	1
tree	1
to	1
another;	1
and	1
unable	1
to	1
conceive	1
what	1
it	1
could	1
be,	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
Sancho,	1
“Sancho,	1
it	1
strikes	1
me	1
this	1
affair	1
of	1
these	1
nets	1
will	1
prove	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
strangest	1
adventures	1
imaginable.	1
May	1
I	1
die	1
if	1
the	1
enchanters	1
that	1
persecute	1
me	1
are	1
not	1
trying	1
to	1
entangle	1
me	1
in	1
them	1
and	1
delay	1
my	1
journey,	1
by	1
way	1
of	1
revenge	1
for	1
my	1
obduracy	1
towards	1
Altisidora.	1
Well	1
then	1
let	1
me	1
tell	1
them	1
that	1
if	1
these	1
nets,	1
instead	1
of	1
being	1
green	1
cord,	1
were	1
made	1
of	1
the	1
hardest	1
diamonds,	1
or	1
stronger	1
than	1
that	1
wherewith	1
the	1
jealous	1
god	1
of	1
blacksmiths	1
enmeshed	1
Venus	1
and	1
Mars,	1
I	1
would	1
break	1
them	1
as	1
easily	1
as	1
if	1
they	1
were	1
made	1
of	1
rushes	1
or	1
cotton	1
threads.”	1
But	1
just	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
press	1
forward	1
and	1
break	1
through	1
all,	1
suddenly	1
from	1
among	1
some	1
trees	1
two	1
shepherdesses	1
of	1
surpassing	1
beauty	1
presented	1
themselves	1
to	1
his	1
sight—or	1
at	1
least	1
damsels	1
dressed	1
like	1
shepherdesses,	1
save	1
that	1
their	1
jerkins	1
and	1
sayas	1
were	1
of	1
fine	1
brocade;	1
that	1
is	1
to	1
say,	1
the	1
sayas	1
were	1
rich	1
farthingales	1
of	1
gold	1
embroidered	1
tabby.	1
Their	1
hair,	1
that	1
in	1
its	1
golden	1
brightness	1
vied	1
with	1
the	1
beams	1
of	1
the	1
sun	1
itself,	1
fell	1
loose	1
upon	1
their	1
shoulders	1
and	1
was	1
crowned	1
with	1
garlands	1
twined	1
with	1
green	1
laurel	1
and	1
red	1
everlasting;	1
and	1
their	1
years	1
to	1
all	1
appearance	1
were	1
not	1
under	1
fifteen	1
nor	1
above	1
eighteen.	1

Such	1
was	1
the	1
spectacle	1
that	1
filled	1
Sancho	1
with	1
amazement,	1
fascinated	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
made	1
the	1
sun	1
halt	1
in	1
his	1
course	1
to	1
behold	1
them,	1
and	1
held	1
all	1
four	1
in	1
a	1
strange	1
silence.	1
One	1
of	1
the	1
shepherdesses,	1
at	1
length,	1
was	1
the	1
first	1
to	1
speak	1
and	1
said	1
to	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“Hold,	1
sir	1
knight,	1
and	1
do	1
not	1
break	1
these	1
nets;	1
for	1
they	1
are	1
not	1
spread	1
here	1
to	1
do	1
you	1
any	1
harm,	1
but	1
only	1
for	1
our	1
amusement;	1
and	1
as	1
I	1
know	1
you	1
will	1
ask	1
why	1
they	1
have	1
been	1
put	1
up,	1
and	1
who	1
we	1
are,	1
I	1
will	1
tell	1
you	1
in	1
a	1
few	1
words.	1
In	1
a	1
village	1
some	1
two	1
leagues	1
from	1
this,	1
where	1
there	1
are	1
many	1
people	1
of	1
quality	1
and	1
rich	1
gentlefolk,	1
it	1
was	1
agreed	1
upon	1
by	1
a	1
number	1
of	1
friends	1
and	1
relations	1
to	1
come	1
with	1
their	1
wives,	1
sons	1
and	1
daughters,	1
neighbours,	1
friends	1
and	1
kinsmen,	1
and	1
make	1
holiday	1
in	1
this	1
spot,	1
which	1
is	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
pleasantest	1
in	1
the	1
whole	1
neighbourhood,	1
setting	1
up	1
a	1
new	1
pastoral	1
Arcadia	1
among	1
ourselves,	1
we	1
maidens	1
dressing	1
ourselves	1
as	1
shepherdesses	1
and	1
the	1
youths	1
as	1
shepherds.	1
We	1
have	1
prepared	1
two	1
eclogues,	1
one	1
by	1
the	1
famous	1
poet	1
Garcilasso,	1
the	1
other	1
by	1
the	1
most	1
excellent	1
Camoens,	1
in	1
its	1
own	1
Portuguese	1
tongue,	1
but	1
we	1
have	1
not	1
as	1
yet	1
acted	1
them.	1
Yesterday	1
was	1
the	1
first	1
day	1
of	1
our	1
coming	1
here;	1
we	1
have	1
a	1
few	1
of	1
what	1
they	1
say	1
are	1
called	1
field-tents	1
pitched	1
among	1
the	1
trees	1
on	1
the	1
bank	1
of	1
an	1
ample	1
brook	1
that	1
fertilises	1
all	1
these	1
meadows;	1
last	1
night	1
we	1
spread	1
these	1
nets	1
in	1
the	1
trees	1
here	1
to	1
snare	1
the	1
silly	1
little	1
birds	1
that	1
startled	1
by	1
the	1
noise	1
we	1
make	1
may	1
fly	1
into	1
them.	1
If	1
you	1
please	1
to	1
be	1
our	1
guest,	1
señor,	1
you	1
will	1
be	1
welcomed	1
heartily	1
and	1
courteously,	1
for	1
here	1
just	1
now	1
neither	1
care	1
nor	1
sorrow	1
shall	1
enter.”	1
She	1
held	1
her	1
peace	1
and	1
said	1
no	1
more,	1
and	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
made	1
answer,	1
“Of	1
a	1
truth,	1
fairest	1
lady,	1
Actaeon	1
when	1
he	1
unexpectedly	1
beheld	1
Diana	1
bathing	1
in	1
the	1
stream	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
been	1
more	1
fascinated	1
and	1
wonderstruck	1
than	1
I	1
at	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
your	1
beauty.	1
I	1
commend	1
your	1
mode	1
of	1
entertainment,	1
and	1
thank	1
you	1
for	1
the	1
kindness	1
of	1
your	1
invitation;	1
and	1
if	1
I	1
can	1
serve	1
you,	1
you	1
may	1
command	1
me	1
with	1
full	1
confidence	1
of	1
being	1
obeyed,	1
for	1
my	1
profession	1
is	1
none	1
other	1
than	1
to	1
show	1
myself	1
grateful,	1
and	1
ready	1
to	1
serve	1
persons	1
of	1
all	1
conditions,	1
but	1
especially	1
persons	1
of	1
quality	1
such	1
as	1
your	1
appearance	1
indicates;	1
and	1
if,	1
instead	1
of	1
taking	1
up,	1
as	1
they	1
probably	1
do,	1
but	1
a	1
small	1
space,	1
these	1
nets	1
took	1
up	1
the	1
whole	1
surface	1
of	1
the	1
globe,	1
I	1
would	1
seek	1
out	1
new	1
worlds	1
through	1
which	1
to	1
pass,	1
so	1
as	1
not	1
to	1
break	1
them;	1
and	1
that	1
ye	1
may	1
give	1
some	1
degree	1
of	1
credence	1
to	1
this	1
exaggerated	1
language	1
of	1
mine,	1
know	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
no	1
less	1
than	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
of	1
La	1
Mancha	1
that	1
makes	1
this	1
declaration	1
to	1
you,	1
if	1
indeed	1
it	1
be	1
that	1
such	1
a	1
name	1
has	1
reached	1
your	1
ears.”	1
“Ah!	1
friend	1
of	1
my	1
soul,”	1
instantly	1
exclaimed	1
the	1
other	1
shepherdess,	1
“what	1
great	1
good	1
fortune	1
has	1
befallen	1
us!	1
Seest	1
thou	1
this	1
gentleman	1
we	1
have	1
before	1
us?	1
Well	1
then	1
let	1
me	1
tell	1
thee	1
he	1
is	1
the	1
most	1
valiant	1
and	1
the	1
most	1
devoted	1
and	1
the	1
most	1
courteous	1
gentleman	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
world,	1
unless	1
a	1
history	1
of	1
his	1
achievements	1
that	1
has	1
been	1
printed	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
read	1
is	1
telling	1
lies	1
and	1
deceiving	1
us.	1
I	1
will	1
lay	1
a	1
wager	1
that	1
this	1
good	1
fellow	1
who	1
is	1
with	1
him	1
is	1
one	1
Sancho	1
Panza	1
his	1
squire,	1
whose	1
drolleries	1
none	1
can	1
equal.”	1
“That’s	1
true,”	1
said	1
Sancho;	1
“I	1
am	1
that	1
same	1
droll	1
and	1
squire	1
you	1
speak	1
of,	1
and	1
this	1
gentleman	1
is	1
my	1
master	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
of	1
La	1
Mancha,	1
the	1
same	1
that’s	1
in	1
the	1
history	1
and	1
that	1
they	1
talk	1
about.”	1
“Oh,	1
my	1
friend,”	1
said	1
the	1
other,	1
“let	1
us	1
entreat	1
him	1
to	1
stay;	1
for	1
it	1
will	1
give	1
our	1
fathers	1
and	1
brothers	1
infinite	1
pleasure;	1
I	1
too	1
have	1
heard	1
just	1
what	1
thou	1
hast	1
told	1
me	1
of	1
the	1
valour	1
of	1
the	1
one	1
and	1
the	1
drolleries	1
of	1
the	1
other;	1
and	1
what	1
is	1
more,	1
of	1
him	1
they	1
say	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
the	1
most	1
constant	1
and	1
loyal	1
lover	1
that	1
was	1
ever	1
heard	1
of,	1
and	1
that	1
his	1
lady	1
is	1
one	1
Dulcinea	1
del	1
Toboso,	1
to	1
whom	1
all	1
over	1
Spain	1
the	1
palm	1
of	1
beauty	1
is	1
awarded.”	1
“And	1
justly	1
awarded,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“unless,	1
indeed,	1
your	1
unequalled	1
beauty	1
makes	1
it	1
a	1
matter	1
of	1
doubt.	1
But	1
spare	1
yourselves	1
the	1
trouble,	1
ladies,	1
of	1
pressing	1
me	1
to	1
stay,	1
for	1
the	1
urgent	1
calls	1
of	1
my	1
profession	1
do	1
not	1
allow	1
me	1
to	1
take	1
rest	1
under	1
any	1
circumstances.”	1
At	1
this	1
instant	1
there	1
came	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
spot	1
where	1
the	1
four	1
stood	1
a	1
brother	1
of	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
two	1
shepherdesses,	1
like	1
them	1
in	1
shepherd	1
costume,	1
and	1
as	1
richly	1
and	1
gaily	1
dressed	1
as	1
they	1
were.	1
They	1
told	1
him	1
that	1
their	1
companion	1
was	1
the	1
valiant	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
of	1
La	1
Mancha,	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
Sancho	1
his	1
squire,	1
of	1
whom	1
he	1
knew	1
already	1
from	1
having	1
read	1
their	1
history.	1
The	1
gay	1
shepherd	1
offered	1
him	1
his	1
services	1
and	1
begged	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
accompany	1
him	1
to	1
their	1
tents,	1
and	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
had	1
to	1
give	1
way	1
and	1
comply.	1
And	1
now	1
the	1
game	1
was	1
started,	1
and	1
the	1
nets	1
were	1
filled	1
with	1
a	1
variety	1
of	1
birds	1
that	1
deceived	1
by	1
the	1
colour	1
fell	1
into	1
the	1
danger	1
they	1
were	1
flying	1
from.	1
Upwards	1
of	1
thirty	1
persons,	1
all	1
gaily	1
attired	1
as	1
shepherds	1
and	1
shepherdesses,	1
assembled	1
on	1
the	1
spot,	1
and	1
were	1
at	1
once	1
informed	1
who	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
and	1
his	1
squire	1
were,	1
whereat	1
they	1
were	1
not	1
a	1
little	1
delighted,	1
as	1
they	1
knew	1
of	1
him	1
already	1
through	1
his	1
history.	1
They	1
repaired	1
to	1
the	1
tents,	1
where	1
they	1
found	1
tables	1
laid	1
out,	1
and	1
choicely,	1
plentifully,	1
and	1
neatly	1
furnished.	1
They	1
treated	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
as	1
a	1
person	1
of	1
distinction,	1
giving	1
him	1
the	1
place	1
of	1
honour,	1
and	1
all	1
observed	1
him,	1
and	1
were	1
full	1
of	1
astonishment	1
at	1
the	1
spectacle.	1
At	1
last	1
the	1
cloth	1
being	1
removed,	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
with	1
great	1
composure	1
lifted	1
up	1
his	1
voice	1
and	1
said:	1
“One	1
of	1
the	1
greatest	1
sins	1
that	1
men	1
are	1
guilty	1
of	1
is—some	1
will	1
say	1
pride—but	1
I	1
say	1
ingratitude,	1
going	1
by	1
the	1
common	1
saying	1
that	1
hell	1
is	1
full	1
of	1
ingrates.	1
This	1
sin,	1
so	1
far	1
as	1
it	1
has	1
lain	1
in	1
my	1
power,	1
I	1
have	1
endeavoured	1
to	1
avoid	1
ever	1
since	1
I	1
have	1
enjoyed	1
the	1
faculty	1
of	1
reason;	1
and	1
if	1
I	1
am	1
unable	1
to	1
requite	1
good	1
deeds	1
that	1
have	1
been	1
done	1
me	1
by	1
other	1
deeds,	1
I	1
substitute	1
the	1
desire	1
to	1
do	1
so;	1
and	1
if	1
that	1
be	1
not	1
enough	1
I	1
make	1
them	1
known	1
publicly;	1
for	1
he	1
who	1
declares	1
and	1
makes	1
known	1
the	1
good	1
deeds	1
done	1
to	1
him	1
would	1
repay	1
them	1
by	1
others	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
in	1
his	1
power,	1
and	1
for	1
the	1
most	1
part	1
those	1
who	1
receive	1
are	1
the	1
inferiors	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
give.	1
Thus,	1
God	1
is	1
superior	1
to	1
all	1
because	1
he	1
is	1
the	1
supreme	1
giver,	1
and	1
the	1
offerings	1
of	1
man	1
fall	1
short	1
by	1
an	1
infinite	1
distance	1
of	1
being	1
a	1
full	1
return	1
for	1
the	1
gifts	1
of	1
God;	1
but	1
gratitude	1
in	1
some	1
degree	1
makes	1
up	1
for	1
this	1
deficiency	1
and	1
shortcoming.	1
I	1
therefore,	1
grateful	1
for	1
the	1
favour	1
that	1
has	1
been	1
extended	1
to	1
me	1
here,	1
and	1
unable	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
return	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
measure,	1
restricted	1
as	1
I	1
am	1
by	1
the	1
narrow	1
limits	1
of	1
my	1
power,	1
offer	1
what	1
I	1
can	1
and	1
what	1
I	1
have	1
to	1
offer	1
in	1
my	1
own	1
way;	1
and	1
so	1
I	1
declare	1
that	1
for	1
two	1
full	1
days	1
I	1
will	1
maintain	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
this	1
highway	1
leading	1
to	1
Saragossa,	1
that	1
these	1
ladies	1
disguised	1
as	1
shepherdesses,	1
who	1
are	1
here	1
present,	1
are	1
the	1
fairest	1
and	1
most	1
courteous	1
maidens	1
in	1
the	1
world,	1
excepting	1
only	1
the	1
peerless	1
Dulcinea	1
del	1
Toboso,	1
sole	1
mistress	1
of	1
my	1
thoughts,	1
be	1
it	1
said	1
without	1
offence	1
to	1
those	1
who	1
hear	1
me,	1
ladies	1
and	1
gentlemen.”	1
On	1
hearing	1
this	1
Sancho,	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
listening	1
with	1
great	1
attention,	1
cried	1
out	1
in	1
a	1
loud	1
voice,	1
“Is	1
it	1
possible	1
there	1
is	1
anyone	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
who	1
will	1
dare	1
to	1
say	1
and	1
swear	1
that	1
this	1
master	1
of	1
mine	1
is	1
a	1
madman?	1
Say,	1
gentlemen	1
shepherds,	1
is	1
there	1
a	1
village	1
priest,	1
be	1
he	1
ever	1
so	1
wise	1
or	1
learned,	1
who	1
could	1
say	1
what	1
my	1
master	1
has	1
said;	1
or	1
is	1
there	1
knight-errant,	1
whatever	1
renown	1
he	1
may	1
have	1
as	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
valour,	1
that	1
could	1
offer	1
what	1
my	1
master	1
has	1
offered	1
now?”	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
turned	1
upon	1
Sancho,	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
countenance	1
glowing	1
with	1
anger	1
said	1
to	1
him,	1
“Is	1
it	1
possible,	1
Sancho,	1
there	1
is	1
anyone	1
in	1
the	1
whole	1
world	1
who	1
will	1
say	1
thou	1
art	1
not	1
a	1
fool,	1
with	1
a	1
lining	1
to	1
match,	1
and	1
I	1
know	1
not	1
what	1
trimmings	1
of	1
impertinence	1
and	1
roguery?	1
Who	1
asked	1
thee	1
to	1
meddle	1
in	1
my	1
affairs,	1
or	1
to	1
inquire	1
whether	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
wise	1
man	1
or	1
a	1
blockhead?	1
Hold	1
thy	1
peace;	1
answer	1
me	1
not	1
a	1
word;	1
saddle	1
Rocinante	1
if	1
he	1
be	1
unsaddled;	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
go	1
to	1
put	1
my	1
offer	1
into	1
execution;	1
for	1
with	1
the	1
right	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
on	1
my	1
side	1
thou	1
mayest	1
reckon	1
as	1
vanquished	1
all	1
who	1
shall	1
venture	1
to	1
question	1
it;”	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
great	1
rage,	1
and	1
showing	1
his	1
anger	1
plainly,	1
he	1
rose	1
from	1
his	1
seat,	1
leaving	1
the	1
company	1
lost	1
in	1
wonder,	1
and	1
making	1
them	1
feel	1
doubtful	1
whether	1
they	1
ought	1
to	1
regard	1
him	1
as	1
a	1
madman	1
or	1
a	1
rational	1
being.	1
In	1
the	1
end,	1
though	1
they	1
sought	1
to	1
dissuade	1
him	1
from	1
involving	1
himself	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
challenge,	1
assuring	1
him	1
they	1
admitted	1
his	1
gratitude	1
as	1
fully	1
established,	1
and	1
needed	1
no	1
fresh	1
proofs	1
to	1
be	1
convinced	1
of	1
his	1
valiant	1
spirit,	1
as	1
those	1
related	1
in	1
the	1
history	1
of	1
his	1
exploits	1
were	1
sufficient,	1
still	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
persisted	1
in	1
his	1
resolve;	1
and	1
mounted	1
on	1
Rocinante,	1
bracing	1
his	1
buckler	1
on	1
his	1
arm	1
and	1
grasping	1
his	1
lance,	1
he	1
posted	1
himself	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
a	1
high	1
road	1
that	1
was	1
not	1
far	1
from	1
the	1
green	1
meadow.	1
Sancho	1
followed	1
on	1
Dapple,	1
together	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
members	1
of	1
the	1
pastoral	1
gathering,	1
eager	1
to	1
see	1
what	1
would	1
be	1
the	1
upshot	1
of	1
his	1
vainglorious	1
and	1
extraordinary	1
proposal.	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
then,	1
having,	1
as	1
has	1
been	1
said,	1
planted	1
himself	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
road,	1
made	1
the	1
welkin	1
ring	1
with	1
words	1
to	1
this	1
effect:	1
“Ho	1
ye	1
travellers	1
and	1
wayfarers,	1
knights,	1
squires,	1
folk	1
on	1
foot	1
or	1
on	1
horseback,	1
who	1
pass	1
this	1
way	1
or	1
shall	1
pass	1
in	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
the	1
next	1
two	1
days!	1
Know	1
that	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
of	1
La	1
Mancha,	1
knight-errant,	1
is	1
posted	1
here	1
to	1
maintain	1
by	1
arms	1
that	1
the	1
beauty	1
and	1
courtesy	1
enshrined	1
in	1
the	1
nymphs	1
that	1
dwell	1
in	1
these	1
meadows	1
and	1
groves	1
surpass	1
all	1
upon	1
earth,	1
putting	1
aside	1
the	1
lady	1
of	1
my	1
heart,	1
Dulcinea	1
del	1
Toboso.	1
Wherefore,	1
let	1
him	1
who	1
is	1
of	1
the	1
opposite	1
opinion	1
come	1
on,	1
for	1
here	1
I	1
await	1
him.”	1
Twice	1
he	1
repeated	1
the	1
same	1
words,	1
and	1
twice	1
they	1
fell	1
unheard	1
by	1
any	1
adventurer;	1
but	1
fate,	1
that	1
was	1
guiding	1
affairs	1
for	1
him	1
from	1
better	1
to	1
better,	1
so	1
ordered	1
it	1
that	1
shortly	1
afterwards	1
there	1
appeared	1
on	1
the	1
road	1
a	1
crowd	1
of	1
men	1
on	1
horseback,	1
many	1
of	1
them	1
with	1
lances	1
in	1
their	1
hands,	1
all	1
riding	1
in	1
a	1
compact	1
body	1
and	1
in	1
great	1
haste.	1
No	1
sooner	1
had	1
those	1
who	1
were	1
with	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
seen	1
them	1
than	1
they	1
turned	1
about	1
and	1
withdrew	1
to	1
some	1
distance	1
from	1
the	1
road,	1
for	1
they	1
knew	1
that	1
if	1
they	1
stayed	1
some	1
harm	1
might	1
come	1
to	1
them;	1
but	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
with	1
intrepid	1
heart	1
stood	1
his	1
ground,	1
and	1
Sancho	1
Panza	1
shielded	1
himself	1
with	1
Rocinante’s	1
hind-quarters.	1
The	1
troop	1
of	1
lancers	1
came	1
up,	1
and	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
who	1
was	1
in	1
advance	1
began	1
shouting	1
to	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“Get	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
way,	1
you	1
son	1
of	1
the	1
devil,	1
or	1
these	1
bulls	1
will	1
knock	1
you	1
to	1
pieces!”	1
“Rabble!”	1
returned	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“I	1
care	1
nothing	1
for	1
bulls,	1
be	1
they	1
the	1
fiercest	1
Jarama	1
breeds	1
on	1
its	1
banks.	1
Confess	1
at	1
once,	1
scoundrels,	1
that	1
what	1
I	1
have	1
declared	1
is	1
true;	1
else	1
ye	1
have	1
to	1
deal	1
with	1
me	1
in	1
combat.”	1
The	1
herdsman	1
had	1
no	1
time	1
to	1
reply,	1
nor	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
to	1
get	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
way	1
even	1
if	1
he	1
wished;	1
and	1
so	1
the	1
drove	1
of	1
fierce	1
bulls	1
and	1
tame	1
bullocks,	1
together	1
with	1
the	1
crowd	1
of	1
herdsmen	1
and	1
others	1
who	1
were	1
taking	1
them	1
to	1
be	1
penned	1
up	1
in	1
a	1
village	1
where	1
they	1
were	1
to	1
be	1
run	1
the	1
next	1
day,	1
passed	1
over	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
and	1
over	1
Sancho,	1
Rocinante	1
and	1
Dapple,	1
hurling	1
them	1
all	1
to	1
the	1
earth	1
and	1
rolling	1
them	1
over	1
on	1
the	1
ground.	1
Sancho	1
was	1
left	1
crushed,	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
scared,	1
Dapple	1
belaboured	1
and	1
Rocinante	1
in	1
no	1
very	1
sound	1
condition.	1

They	1
all	1
got	1
up,	1
however,	1
at	1
length,	1
and	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
in	1
great	1
haste,	1
stumbling	1
here	1
and	1
falling	1
there,	1
started	1
off	1
running	1
after	1
the	1
drove,	1
shouting	1
out,	1
“Hold!	1
stay!	1
ye	1
rascally	1
rabble,	1
a	1
single	1
knight	1
awaits	1
you,	1
and	1
he	1
is	1
not	1
of	1
the	1
temper	1
or	1
opinion	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
say,	1
‘For	1
a	1
flying	1
enemy	1
make	1
a	1
bridge	1
of	1
silver.’”	1
The	1
retreating	1
party	1
in	1
their	1
haste,	1
however,	1
did	1
not	1
stop	1
for	1
that,	1
or	1
heed	1
his	1
menaces	1
any	1
more	1
than	1
last	1
year’s	1
clouds.	1
Weariness	1
brought	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
to	1
a	1
halt,	1
and	1
more	1
enraged	1
than	1
avenged	1
he	1
sat	1
down	1
on	1
the	1
road	1
to	1
wait	1
until	1
Sancho,	1

the	1

or	1

Arcadia,	1
and	1
more	1
in	1

contentment,	1
they	1
continued	1
their	1
journey.	1

A	1
clear	1
limpid	1
spring	1
which	1
they	1
discovered	1
in	1
a	1
cool	1
grove	1
relieved	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
and	1
Sancho	1
of	1
the	1
dust	1
and	1
fatigue	1
due	1
to	1
the	1
unpolite	1
behaviour	1
of	1
the	1
bulls,	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
side	1
of	1
this,	1
having	1
turned	1
Dapple	1
and	1
Rocinante	1
loose	1
without	1
headstall	1
or	1
bridle,	1
the	1
forlorn	1
pair,	1
master	1
and	1
man,	1
seated	1
themselves.	1
Sancho	1
had	1
recourse	1
to	1
the	1
larder	1
of	1
his	1
alforjas	1
and	1
took	1
out	1
of	1
them	1
what	1
he	1
called	1
the	1
prog;	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
rinsed	1
his	1
mouth	1
and	1
bathed	1
his	1
face,	1
by	1
which	1
cooling	1
process	1
his	1
flagging	1
energies	1
were	1
revived.	1
Out	1
of	1
pure	1
vexation	1
he	1
remained	1
without	1
eating,	1
and	1
out	1
of	1
pure	1
politeness	1
Sancho	1
did	1
not	1
venture	1
to	1
touch	1
a	1
morsel	1
of	1
what	1
was	1
before	1
him,	1
but	1
waited	1
for	1
his	1
master	1
to	1
act	1
as	1
taster.	1
Seeing,	1
however,	1
that,	1
absorbed	1
in	1
thought,	1
he	1
was	1
forgetting	1
to	1
carry	1
the	1
bread	1
to	1
his	1
mouth,	1
he	1
said	1
never	1
a	1
word,	1
and	1
trampling	1
every	1
sort	1
of	1
good	1
breeding	1
under	1
foot,	1
began	1
to	1
stow	1
away	1
in	1
his	1
paunch	1
the	1
bread	1
and	1
cheese	1
that	1
came	1
to	1
his	1
hand.	1

“Eat,	1
Sancho	1
my	1
friend,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
“support	1
life,	1
which	1
is	1
of	1
more	1
consequence	1
to	1
thee	1
than	1
to	1
me,	1
and	1
leave	1
me	1
to	1
die	1
under	1
the	1
pain	1
of	1
my	1
thoughts	1
and	1
pressure	1
of	1
my	1
misfortunes.	1
I	1
was	1
born,	1
Sancho,	1
to	1
live	1
dying,	1
and	1
thou	1
to	1
die	1
eating;	1
and	1
to	1
prove	1
the	1
truth	1
of	1
what	1
I	1
say,	1
look	1
at	1
me,	1
printed	1
in	1
histories,	1
famed	1
in	1
arms,	1
courteous	1
in	1
behaviour,	1
honoured	1
by	1
princes,	1
courted	1
by	1
maidens;	1
and	1
after	1
all,	1
when	1
I	1
looked	1
forward	1
to	1
palms,	1
triumphs,	1
and	1
crowns,	1
won	1
and	1
earned	1
by	1
my	1
valiant	1
deeds,	1
I	1
have	1
this	1
morning	1
seen	1
myself	1
trampled	1
on,	1
kicked,	1
and	1
crushed	1
by	1
the	1
feet	1
of	1
unclean	1
and	1
filthy	1
animals.	1
This	1
thought	1
blunts	1
my	1
teeth,	1
paralyses	1
my	1
jaws,	1
cramps	1
my	1
hands,	1
and	1
robs	1
me	1
of	1
all	1
appetite	1
for	1
food;	1
so	1
much	1
so	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
a	1
mind	1
to	1
let	1
myself	1
die	1
of	1
hunger,	1
the	1
cruelest	1
death	1
of	1
all	1
deaths.”	1
“So	1
then,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
munching	1
hard	1
all	1
the	1
time,	1
“your	1
worship	1
does	1
not	1
agree	1
with	1
the	1
proverb	1
that	1
says,	1
‘Let	1
Martha	1
die,	1
but	1
let	1
her	1
die	1
with	1
a	1
full	1
belly.’	1
I,	1
at	1
any	1
rate,	1
have	1
no	1
mind	1
to	1
kill	1
myself;	1
so	1
far	1
from	1
that,	1
I	1
mean	1
to	1
do	1
as	1
the	1
cobbler	1
does,	1
who	1
stretches	1
the	1
leather	1
with	1
his	1
teeth	1
until	1
he	1
makes	1
it	1
reach	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
he	1
wants.	1
I’ll	1
stretch	1
out	1
my	1
life	1
by	1
eating	1
until	1
it	1
reaches	1
the	1
end	1
heaven	1
has	1
fixed	1
for	1
it;	1
and	1
let	1
me	1
tell	1
you,	1
señor,	1
there’s	1
no	1
greater	1
folly	1
than	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
dying	1
of	1
despair	1
as	1
your	1
worship	1
does;	1
take	1
my	1
advice,	1
and	1
after	1
eating	1
lie	1
down	1
and	1
sleep	1
a	1
bit	1
on	1
this	1
green	1
grass-mattress,	1
and	1
you	1
will	1
see	1
that	1
when	1
you	1
awake	1
you’ll	1
feel	1
something	1
better.”	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
did	1
as	1
he	1
recommended,	1
for	1
it	1
struck	1
him	1
that	1
Sancho’s	1
reasoning	1
was	1
more	1
like	1
a	1
philosopher’s	1
than	1
a	1
blockhead’s,	1
and	1
said	1
he,	1
“Sancho,	1
if	1
thou	1
wilt	1
do	1
for	1
me	1
what	1
I	1
am	1
going	1
to	1
tell	1
thee	1
my	1
ease	1
of	1
mind	1
would	1
be	1
more	1
assured	1
and	1
my	1
heaviness	1
of	1
heart	1
not	1
so	1
great;	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
this;	1
to	1
go	1
aside	1
a	1
little	1
while	1
I	1
am	1
sleeping	1
in	1
accordance	1
with	1
thy	1
advice,	1
and,	1
making	1
bare	1
thy	1
carcase	1
to	1
the	1
air,	1
to	1
give	1
thyself	1
three	1
or	1
four	1
hundred	1
lashes	1
with	1
Rocinante’s	1
reins,	1
on	1
account	1
of	1
the	1
three	1
thousand	1
and	1
odd	1
thou	1
art	1
to	1
give	1
thyself	1
for	1
the	1
disenchantment	1
of	1
Dulcinea;	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
great	1
pity	1
that	1
the	1
poor	1
lady	1
should	1
be	1
left	1
enchanted	1
through	1
thy	1
carelessness	1
and	1
negligence.”	1
“There	1
is	1
a	1
good	1
deal	1
to	1
be	1
said	1
on	1
that	1
point,”	1
said	1
Sancho;	1
“let	1
us	1
both	1
go	1
to	1
sleep	1
now,	1
and	1
after	1
that,	1
God	1
has	1
decreed	1
what	1
will	1
happen.	1
Let	1
me	1
tell	1
your	1
worship	1
that	1
for	1
a	1
man	1
to	1
whip	1
himself	1
in	1
cold	1
blood	1
is	1
a	1
hard	1
thing,	1
especially	1
if	1
the	1
stripes	1
fall	1
upon	1
an	1
ill-nourished	1
and	1
worse-fed	1
body.	1
Let	1
my	1
lady	1
Dulcinea	1
have	1
patience,	1
and	1
when	1
she	1
is	1
least	1
expecting	1
it,	1
she	1
will	1
see	1
me	1
made	1
a	1
riddle	1
of	1
with	1
whipping,	1
and	1
‘until	1
death	1
it’s	1
all	1
life;’	1
I	1
mean	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
still	1
life	1
in	1
me,	1
and	1
the	1
desire	1
to	1
make	1
good	1
what	1
I	1
have	1
promised.”	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
thanked	1
him,	1
and	1
ate	1
a	1
little,	1
and	1
Sancho	1
a	1
good	1
deal,	1
and	1
then	1
they	1
both	1
lay	1
down	1
to	1
sleep,	1
leaving	1
those	1
two	1
inseparable	1
friends	1
and	1
comrades,	1
Rocinante	1
and	1
Dapple,	1
to	1
their	1
own	1
devices	1
and	1
to	1
feed	1
unrestrained	1
upon	1
the	1
abundant	1
grass	1
with	1
which	1
the	1
meadow	1
was	1
furnished.	1
They	1
woke	1
up	1
rather	1
late,	1
mounted	1
once	1
more	1
and	1
resumed	1
their	1
journey,	1
pushing	1
on	1
to	1
reach	1
an	1
inn	1
which	1
was	1
in	1
sight,	1
apparently	1
a	1
league	1
off.	1
I	1
say	1
an	1
inn,	1
because	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
called	1
it	1
so,	1
contrary	1
to	1
his	1
usual	1
practice	1
of	1
calling	1
all	1
inns	1
castles.	1
They	1
reached	1
it,	1
and	1
asked	1
the	1
landlord	1
if	1
they	1
could	1
put	1
up	1
there.	1
He	1
said	1
yes,	1
with	1
as	1
much	1
comfort	1
and	1
as	1
good	1
fare	1
as	1
they	1
could	1
find	1
in	1
Saragossa.	1
They	1
dismounted,	1
and	1
Sancho	1
stowed	1
away	1
his	1
larder	1
in	1
a	1
room	1
of	1
which	1
the	1
landlord	1
gave	1
him	1
the	1
key.	1
He	1
took	1
the	1
beasts	1
to	1
the	1
stable,	1
fed	1
them,	1
and	1
came	1
back	1
to	1
see	1
what	1
orders	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
who	1
was	1
seated	1
on	1
a	1
bench	1
at	1
the	1
door,	1
had	1
for	1
him,	1
giving	1
special	1
thanks	1
to	1
heaven	1
that	1
this	1
inn	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
taken	1
for	1
a	1
castle	1
by	1
his	1
master.	1
Supper-time	1
came,	1
and	1
they	1
repaired	1
to	1
their	1
room,	1
and	1
Sancho	1
asked	1
the	1
landlord	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
give	1
them	1
for	1
supper.	1
To	1
this	1
the	1
landlord	1
replied	1
that	1
his	1
mouth	1
should	1
be	1
the	1
measure;	1
he	1
had	1
only	1
to	1
ask	1
what	1
he	1
would;	1
for	1
that	1
inn	1
was	1
provided	1
with	1
the	1
birds	1
of	1
the	1
air	1
and	1
the	1
fowls	1
of	1
the	1
earth	1
and	1
the	1
fish	1
of	1
the	1
sea.	1
“There’s	1
no	1
need	1
of	1
all	1
that,”	1
said	1
Sancho;	1
“if	1
they’ll	1
roast	1
us	1
a	1
couple	1
of	1
chickens	1
we’ll	1
be	1
satisfied,	1
for	1
my	1
master	1
is	1
delicate	1
and	1
eats	1
little,	1
and	1
I’m	1
not	1
over	1
and	1
above	1
gluttonous.”	1
The	1
landlord	1
replied	1
he	1
had	1
no	1
chickens,	1
for	1
the	1
kites	1
had	1
stolen	1
them.	1
“Well	1
then,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“let	1
señor	1
landlord	1
tell	1
them	1
to	1
roast	1
a	1
pullet,	1
so	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
tender	1
one.”	1
“Pullet!	1
My	1
father!”	1
said	1
the	1
landlord;	1
“indeed	1
and	1
in	1
truth	1
it’s	1
only	1
yesterday	1
I	1
sent	1
over	1
fifty	1
to	1
the	1
city	1
to	1
sell;	1
but	1
saving	1
pullets	1
ask	1
what	1
you	1
will.”	1
“In	1
that	1
case,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“you	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
without	1
veal	1
or	1
kid.”	1
“Just	1
now,”	1
said	1
the	1
landlord,	1
“there’s	1
none	1
in	1
the	1
house,	1
for	1
it’s	1
all	1
finished;	1
but	1
next	1
week	1
there	1
will	1
be	1
enough	1
and	1
to	1
spare.”	1
“Much	1
good	1
that	1
does	1
us,”	1
said	1
Sancho;	1
“I’ll	1
lay	1
a	1
bet	1
that	1
all	1
these	1
short-comings	1
are	1
going	1
to	1
wind	1
up	1
in	1
plenty	1
of	1
bacon	1
and	1
eggs.”	1
“By	1
God,”	1
said	1
the	1
landlord,	1
“my	1
guest’s	1
wits	1
must	1
be	1
precious	1
dull;	1
I	1
tell	1
him	1
I	1
have	1
neither	1
pullets	1
nor	1
hens,	1
and	1
he	1
wants	1
me	1
to	1
have	1
eggs!	1
Talk	1
of	1
other	1
dainties,	1
if	1
you	1
please,	1
and	1
don’t	1
ask	1
for	1
hens	1
again.”	1
“Body	1
o’	1
me!”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“let’s	1
settle	1
the	1
matter;	1
say	1
at	1
once	1
what	1
you	1
have	1
got,	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
have	1
no	1
more	1
words	1
about	1
it.”	1
“In	1
truth	1
and	1
earnest,	1
señor	1
guest,”	1
said	1
the	1
landlord,	1
“all	1
I	1
have	1
is	1
a	1
couple	1
of	1
cow-heels	1
like	1
calves’	1
feet,	1
or	1
a	1
couple	1
of	1
calves’	1
feet	1
like	1
cowheels;	1
they	1
are	1
boiled	1
with	1
chick-peas,	1
onions,	1
and	1
bacon,	1
and	1
at	1
this	1
moment	1
they	1
are	1
crying	1
‘Come	1
eat	1
me,	1
come	1
eat	1
me.”	1
“I	1
mark	1
them	1
for	1
mine	1
on	1
the	1
spot,”	1
said	1
Sancho;	1
“let	1
nobody	1
touch	1
them;	1
I’ll	1
pay	1
better	1
for	1
them	1
than	1
anyone	1
else,	1
for	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
wish	1
for	1
anything	1
more	1
to	1
my	1
taste;	1
and	1
I	1
don’t	1
care	1
a	1
pin	1
whether	1
they	1
are	1
feet	1
or	1
heels.”	1
“Nobody	1
shall	1
touch	1
them,”	1
said	1
the	1
landlord;	1
“for	1
the	1
other	1
guests	1
I	1
have,	1
being	1
persons	1
of	1
high	1
quality,	1
bring	1
their	1
own	1
cook	1
and	1
caterer	1
and	1
larder	1
with	1
them.”	1
“If	1
you	1
come	1
to	1
people	1
of	1
quality,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“there’s	1
nobody	1
more	1
so	1
than	1
my	1
master;	1
but	1
the	1
calling	1
he	1
follows	1
does	1
not	1
allow	1
of	1
larders	1
or	1
store-rooms;	1
we	1
lay	1
ourselves	1
down	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
a	1
meadow,	1
and	1
fill	1
ourselves	1
with	1
acorns	1
or	1
medlars.”	1
Here	1
ended	1
Sancho’s	1
conversation	1
with	1
the	1
landlord,	1
Sancho	1
not	1
caring	1
to	1
carry	1
it	1
any	1
farther	1
by	1
answering	1
him;	1
for	1
he	1
had	1
already	1
asked	1
him	1
what	1
calling	1
or	1
what	1
profession	1
it	1
was	1
his	1
master	1
was	1
of.	1
Supper-time	1
having	1
come,	1
then,	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
betook	1
himself	1
to	1
his	1
room,	1
the	1
landlord	1
brought	1
in	1
the	1
stew-pan	1
just	1
as	1
it	1
was,	1
and	1
he	1
sat	1
himself	1
down	1
to	1
sup	1
very	1
resolutely.	1
It	1
seems	1
that	1
in	1
another	1
room,	1
which	1
was	1
next	1
to	1
Don	1
Quixote’s,	1
with	1
nothing	1
but	1
a	1
thin	1
partition	1
to	1
separate	1
it,	1
he	1
overheard	1
these	1
words,	1
“As	1
you	1
live,	1
Señor	1
Don	1
Jeronimo,	1
while	1
they	1
are	1
bringing	1
supper,	1
let	1
us	1
read	1
another	1
chapter	1
of	1
the	1
Second	1
Part	1
of	1
‘Don	1
Quixote	1
of	1
La	1
Mancha.’”	1
The	1
instant	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
heard	1
his	1
own	1
name	1
he	1
started	1
to	1
his	1
feet	1
and	1
listened	1
with	1
open	1
ears	1
to	1
catch	1
what	1
they	1
said	1
about	1
him,	1
and	1
heard	1
the	1
Don	1
Jeronimo	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
addressed	1
say	1
in	1
reply,	1
“Why	1
would	1
you	1
have	1
us	1
read	1
that	1
absurd	1
stuff,	1
Don	1
Juan,	1
when	1
it	1
is	1
impossible	1
for	1
anyone	1
who	1
has	1
read	1
the	1
First	1
Part	1
of	1
the	1
history	1
of	1
‘Don	1
Quixote	1
of	1
La	1
Mancha’	1
to	1
take	1
any	1
pleasure	1
in	1
reading	1
this	1
Second	1
Part?”	1
“For	1
all	1
that,”	1
said	1
he	1
who	1
was	1
addressed	1
as	1
Don	1
Juan,	1
“we	1
shall	1
do	1
well	1
to	1
read	1
it,	1
for	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
book	1
so	1
bad	1
but	1
it	1
has	1
something	1
good	1
in	1
it.	1
What	1
displeases	1
me	1
most	1
in	1
it	1
is	1
that	1
it	1
represents	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
as	1
now	1
cured	1
of	1
his	1
love	1
for	1
Dulcinea	1
del	1
Toboso.”	1
On	1
hearing	1
this	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
full	1
of	1
wrath	1
and	1
indignation,	1
lifted	1
up	1
his	1
voice	1
and	1
said,	1
“Whoever	1
he	1
may	1
be	1
who	1
says	1
that	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
of	1
La	1
Mancha	1
has	1
forgotten	1
or	1
can	1
forget	1
Dulcinea	1
del	1
Toboso,	1
I	1
will	1
teach	1
him	1
with	1
equal	1
arms	1
that	1
what	1
he	1
says	1
is	1
very	1
far	1
from	1
the	1
truth;	1
for	1
neither	1
can	1
the	1
peerless	1
Dulcinea	1
del	1
Toboso	1
be	1
forgotten,	1
nor	1
can	1
forgetfulness	1
have	1
a	1
place	1
in	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
his	1
motto	1
is	1
constancy,	1
and	1
his	1
profession	1
to	1
maintain	1
the	1
same	1
with	1
his	1
life	1
and	1
never	1
wrong	1
it.”	1
“Who	1
is	1
this	1
that	1
answers	1
us?”	1
said	1
they	1
in	1
the	1
next	1
room.	1
“Who	1
should	1
it	1
be,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“but	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
of	1
La	1
Mancha	1
himself,	1
who	1
will	1
make	1
good	1
all	1
he	1
has	1
said	1
and	1
all	1
he	1
will	1
say;	1
for	1
pledges	1
don’t	1
trouble	1
a	1
good	1
payer.”	1
Sancho	1
had	1
hardly	1
uttered	1
these	1
words	1
when	1
two	1
gentlemen,	1
for	1
such	1
they	1
seemed	1
to	1
be,	1
entered	1
the	1
room,	1
and	1
one	1
of	1
them,	1
throwing	1
his	1
arms	1
round	1
Don	1
Quixote’s	1
neck,	1
said	1
to	1
him,	1
“Your	1
appearance	1
cannot	1
leave	1
any	1
question	1
as	1
to	1
your	1
name,	1
nor	1
can	1
your	1
name	1
fail	1
to	1
identify	1
your	1
appearance;	1
unquestionably,	1
señor,	1
you	1
are	1
the	1
real	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
of	1
La	1
Mancha,	1
cynosure	1
and	1
morning	1
star	1
of	1
knight-errantry,	1
despite	1
and	1
in	1
defiance	1
of	1
him	1
who	1
has	1
sought	1
to	1
usurp	1
your	1
name	1
and	1
bring	1
to	1
naught	1
your	1
achievements,	1
as	1
the	1
author	1
of	1
this	1
book	1
which	1
I	1
here	1
present	1
to	1
you	1
has	1
done;”	1
and	1
with	1
this	1
he	1
put	1
a	1
book	1
which	1
his	1
companion	1
carried	1
into	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
who	1
took	1
it,	1
and	1
without	1
replying	1
began	1
to	1
run	1
his	1
eye	1
over	1
it;	1
but	1
he	1
presently	1
returned	1
it	1
saying,	1
“In	1
the	1
little	1
I	1
have	1
seen	1
I	1
have	1
discovered	1
three	1
things	1
in	1
this	1
author	1
that	1
deserve	1
to	1
be	1
censured.	1
The	1
first	1
is	1
some	1
words	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
read	1
in	1
the	1
preface;	1
the	1
next	1
that	1
the	1
language	1
is	1
Aragonese,	1
for	1
sometimes	1
he	1
writes	1
without	1
articles;	1
and	1
the	1
third,	1
which	1
above	1
all	1
stamps	1
him	1
as	1
ignorant,	1
is	1
that	1
he	1
goes	1
wrong	1
and	1
departs	1
from	1
the	1
truth	1
in	1
the	1
most	1
important	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
history,	1
for	1
here	1
he	1
says	1
that	1
my	1
squire	1
Sancho	1
Panza’s	1
wife	1
is	1
called	1
Mari	1
Gutierrez,	1
when	1
she	1
is	1
called	1
nothing	1
of	1
the	1
sort,	1
but	1
Teresa	1
Panza;	1
and	1
when	1
a	1
man	1
errs	1
on	1
such	1
an	1
important	1
point	1
as	1
this	1
there	1
is	1
good	1
reason	1
to	1
fear	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
in	1
error	1
on	1
every	1
other	1
point	1
in	1
the	1
history.”	1
“A	1
nice	1
sort	1
of	1
historian,	1
indeed!”	1
exclaimed	1
Sancho	1
at	1
this;	1
“he	1
must	1
know	1
a	1
deal	1
about	1
our	1
affairs	1
when	1
he	1
calls	1
my	1
wife	1
Teresa	1
Panza,	1
Mari	1
Gutierrez;	1
take	1
the	1
book	1
again,	1
señor,	1
and	1
see	1
if	1
I	1
am	1
in	1
it	1
and	1
if	1
he	1
has	1
changed	1
my	1
name.”	1
“From	1
your	1
talk,	1
friend,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Jeronimo,	1
“no	1
doubt	1
you	1
are	1
Sancho	1
Panza,	1
Señor	1
Don	1
Quixote’s	1
squire.”	1
“Yes,	1
I	1
am,”	1
said	1
Sancho;	1
“and	1
I’m	1
proud	1
of	1
it.”	1
“Faith,	1
then,”	1
said	1
the	1
gentleman,	1
“this	1
new	1
author	1
does	1
not	1
handle	1
you	1
with	1
the	1
decency	1
that	1
displays	1
itself	1
in	1
your	1
person;	1
he	1
makes	1
you	1
out	1
a	1
heavy	1
feeder	1
and	1
a	1
fool,	1
and	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
least	1
droll,	1
and	1
a	1
very	1
different	1
being	1
from	1
the	1
Sancho	1
described	1
in	1
the	1
First	1
Part	1
of	1
your	1
master’s	1
history.”	1
“God	1
forgive	1
him,”	1
said	1
Sancho;	1
“he	1
might	1
have	1
left	1
me	1
in	1
my	1
corner	1
without	1
troubling	1
his	1
head	1
about	1
me;	1
‘let	1
him	1
who	1
knows	1
how	1
ring	1
the	1
bells;	1
‘Saint	1
Peter	1
is	1
very	1
well	1
in	1
Rome.’”	1
The	1
two	1
gentlemen	1
pressed	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
to	1
come	1
into	1
their	1
room	1
and	1
have	1
supper	1
with	1
them,	1
as	1
they	1
knew	1
very	1
well	1
there	1
was	1
nothing	1
in	1
that	1
inn	1
fit	1
for	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
sort.	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
who	1
was	1
always	1
polite,	1
yielded	1
to	1
their	1
request	1
and	1
supped	1
with	1
them.	1
Sancho	1
stayed	1
behind	1
with	1
the	1
stew.	1
and	1
invested	1
with	1
plenary	1
delegated	1
authority	1
seated	1
himself	1
at	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
table,	1
and	1
the	1
landlord	1
sat	1
down	1
with	1
him,	1
for	1
he	1
was	1
no	1
less	1
fond	1
of	1
cow-heel	1
and	1
calves’	1
feet	1
than	1
Sancho	1
was.	1
While	1
at	1
supper	1
Don	1
Juan	1
asked	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
what	1
news	1
he	1
had	1
of	1
the	1
lady	1
Dulcinea	1
del	1
Toboso,	1
was	1
she	1
married,	1
had	1
she	1
been	1
brought	1
to	1
bed,	1
or	1
was	1
she	1
with	1
child,	1
or	1
did	1
she	1
in	1
maidenhood,	1
still	1
preserving	1
her	1
modesty	1
and	1
delicacy,	1
cherish	1
the	1
remembrance	1
of	1
the	1
tender	1
passion	1
of	1
Señor	1
Don	1
Quixote?	1
To	1
this	1
he	1
replied,	1
“Dulcinea	1
is	1
a	1
maiden	1
still,	1
and	1
my	1
passion	1
more	1
firmly	1
rooted	1
than	1
ever,	1
our	1
intercourse	1
unsatisfactory	1
as	1
before,	1
and	1
her	1
beauty	1
transformed	1
into	1
that	1
of	1
a	1
foul	1
country	1
wench;”	1
and	1
then	1
he	1
proceeded	1
to	1
give	1
them	1
a	1
full	1
and	1
particular	1
account	1
of	1
the	1
enchantment	1
of	1
Dulcinea,	1
and	1
of	1
what	1
had	1
happened	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
cave	1
of	1
Montesinos,	1
together	1
with	1
what	1
the	1
sage	1
Merlin	1
had	1
prescribed	1
for	1
her	1
disenchantment,	1
namely	1
the	1
scourging	1
of	1
Sancho.	1
Exceedingly	1
great	1
was	1
the	1
amusement	1
the	1
two	1
gentlemen	1
derived	1
from	1
hearing	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
recount	1
the	1
strange	1
incidents	1
of	1
his	1
history;	1
and	1
if	1
they	1
were	1
amazed	1
by	1
his	1
absurdities	1
they	1
were	1
equally	1
amazed	1
by	1
the	1
elegant	1
style	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
delivered	1
them.	1
On	1
the	1
one	1
hand	1
they	1
regarded	1
him	1
as	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
wit	1
and	1
sense,	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
he	1
seemed	1
to	1
them	1
a	1
maundering	1
blockhead,	1
and	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
make	1
up	1
their	1
minds	1
whereabouts	1
between	1
wisdom	1
and	1
folly	1
they	1
ought	1
to	1
place	1
him.	1
Sancho	1
having	1
finished	1
his	1
supper,	1
and	1
left	1
the	1
landlord	1
in	1
the	1
X	1
condition,	1
repaired	1
to	1
the	1
room	1
where	1
his	1
master	1
was,	1
and	1
as	1
he	1
came	1
in	1
said,	1
“May	1
I	1
die,	1
sirs,	1
if	1
the	1
author	1
of	1
this	1
book	1
your	1
worships	1
have	1
got	1
has	1
any	1
mind	1
that	1
we	1
should	1
agree;	1
as	1
he	1
calls	1
me	1
glutton	1
(according	1
to	1
what	1
your	1
worships	1
say)	1
I	1
wish	1
he	1
may	1
not	1
call	1
me	1
drunkard	1
too.”	1
“But	1
he	1
does,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Jeronimo;	1
“I	1
cannot	1
remember,	1
however,	1
in	1
what	1
way,	1
though	1
I	1
know	1
his	1
words	1
are	1
offensive,	1
and	1
what	1
is	1
more,	1
lying,	1
as	1
I	1
can	1
see	1
plainly	1
by	1
the	1
physiognomy	1
of	1
the	1
worthy	1
Sancho	1
before	1
me.”	1
“Believe	1
me,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“the	1
Sancho	1
and	1
the	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
of	1
this	1
history	1
must	1
be	1
different	1
persons	1
from	1
those	1
that	1
appear	1
in	1
the	1
one	1
Cide	1
Hamete	1
Benengeli	1
wrote,	1
who	1
are	1
ourselves;	1
my	1
master	1
valiant,	1
wise,	1
and	1
true	1
in	1
love,	1
and	1
I	1
simple,	1
droll,	1
and	1
neither	1
glutton	1
nor	1
drunkard.”	1
“I	1
believe	1
it,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Juan;	1
“and	1
were	1
it	1
possible,	1
an	1
order	1
should	1
be	1
issued	1
that	1
no	1
one	1
should	1
have	1
the	1
presumption	1
to	1
deal	1
with	1
anything	1
relating	1
to	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
save	1
his	1
original	1
author	1
Cide	1
Hamete;	1
just	1
as	1
Alexander	1
commanded	1
that	1
no	1
one	1
should	1
presume	1
to	1
paint	1
his	1
portrait	1
save	1
Apelles.”	1

“Let	1
him	1
who	1
will	1
paint	1
me,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
“but	1
let	1
him	1
not	1
abuse	1
me;	1
for	1
patience	1
will	1
often	1
break	1
down	1
when	1
they	1
heap	1
insults	1
upon	1
it.”	1
“None	1
can	1
be	1
offered	1
to	1
Señor	1
Don	1
Quixote,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Juan,	1
“that	1
he	1
himself	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
avenge,	1
if	1
he	1
does	1
not	1
ward	1
it	1
off	1
with	1
the	1
shield	1
of	1
his	1
patience,	1
which,	1
I	1
take	1
it,	1
is	1
great	1
and	1
strong.”	1
A	1
considerable	1
portion	1
of	1
the	1
night	1
passed	1
in	1
conversation	1
of	1
this	1
sort,	1
and	1
though	1
Don	1
Juan	1
wished	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
to	1
read	1
more	1
of	1
the	1
book	1
to	1
see	1
what	1
it	1
was	1
all	1
about,	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
prevailed	1
upon,	1
saying	1
that	1
he	1
treated	1
it	1
as	1
read	1
and	1
pronounced	1
it	1
utterly	1
silly;	1
and,	1
if	1
by	1
any	1
chance	1
it	1
should	1
come	1
to	1
its	1
author’s	1
ears	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
it	1
in	1
his	1
hand,	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
want	1
him	1
to	1
flatter	1
himself	1
with	1
the	1
idea	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
read	1
it;	1
for	1
our	1
thoughts,	1
and	1
still	1
more	1
our	1
eyes,	1
should	1
keep	1
themselves	1
aloof	1
from	1
what	1
is	1
obscene	1
and	1
filthy.	1
They	1
asked	1
him	1
whither	1
he	1
meant	1
to	1
direct	1
his	1
steps.	1
He	1
replied,	1
to	1
Saragossa,	1
to	1
take	1
part	1
in	1
the	1
harness	1
jousts	1
which	1
were	1
held	1
in	1
that	1
city	1
every	1
year.	1
Don	1
Juan	1
told	1
him	1
that	1
the	1
new	1
history	1
described	1
how	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
let	1
him	1
be	1
who	1
he	1
might,	1
took	1
part	1
there	1
in	1
a	1
tilting	1
at	1
the	1
ring,	1
utterly	1
devoid	1
of	1
invention,	1
poor	1
in	1
mottoes,	1
very	1
poor	1
in	1
costume,	1
though	1
rich	1
in	1
sillinesses.	1
“For	1
that	1
very	1
reason,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“I	1
will	1
not	1
set	1
foot	1
in	1
Saragossa;	1
and	1
by	1
that	1
means	1
I	1
shall	1
expose	1
to	1
the	1
world	1
the	1
lie	1
of	1
this	1
new	1
history	1
writer,	1
and	1
people	1
will	1
see	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
the	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
he	1
speaks	1
of.”	1
“You	1
will	1
do	1
quite	1
right,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Jeronimo;	1
“and	1
there	1
are	1
other	1
jousts	1
at	1
Barcelona	1
in	1
which	1
Señor	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
may	1
display	1
his	1
prowess.”	1
“That	1
is	1
what	1
I	1
mean	1
to	1
do,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
“and	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
now	1
time,	1
I	1
pray	1
your	1
worships	1
to	1
give	1
me	1
leave	1
to	1
retire	1
to	1
bed,	1
and	1
to	1
place	1
and	1
retain	1
me	1
among	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
your	1
greatest	1
friends	1
and	1
servants.”	1
“And	1
me	1
too,”	1
said	1
Sancho;	1
“maybe	1
I’ll	1
be	1
good	1
for	1
something.”	1
With	1
this	1
they	1
exchanged	1
farewells,	1
and	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
and	1
Sancho	1
retired	1
to	1
their	1
room,	1
leaving	1
Don	1
Juan	1
and	1
Don	1
Jeronimo	1
amazed	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
medley	1
he	1
made	1
of	1
his	1
good	1
sense	1
and	1
his	1
craziness;	1
and	1
they	1
felt	1
thoroughly	1
convinced	1
that	1
these,	1
and	1
not	1
those	1
their	1
Aragonese	1
author	1
described,	1
were	1
the	1
genuine	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
and	1
Sancho.	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
rose	1
betimes,	1
and	1
bade	1
adieu	1
to	1
his	1
hosts	1
by	1
knocking	1
at	1
the	1
partition	1
of	1
the	1
other	1
room.	1
Sancho	1
paid	1
the	1
landlord	1
magnificently,	1
and	1
recommended	1
him	1
either	1
to	1
say	1
less	1
about	1
the	1
providing	1
of	1
his	1
inn	1
or	1
to	1
keep	1
it	1
better	1
provided.	1

It	1
was	1
a	1
fresh	1
morning	1
giving	1
promise	1
of	1
a	1
cool	1
day	1
as	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
quitted	1
the	1
inn,	1
first	1
of	1
all	1
taking	1
care	1
to	1
ascertain	1
the	1
most	1
direct	1
road	1
to	1
Barcelona	1
without	1
touching	1
upon	1
Saragossa;	1
so	1
anxious	1
was	1
he	1
to	1
make	1
out	1
this	1
new	1
historian,	1
who	1
they	1
said	1
abused	1
him	1
so,	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
liar.	1
Well,	1
as	1
it	1
fell	1
out,	1
nothing	1
worthy	1
of	1
being	1
recorded	1
happened	1
him	1
for	1
six	1
days,	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
which,	1
having	1
turned	1
aside	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
road,	1
he	1
was	1
overtaken	1
by	1
night	1
in	1
a	1
thicket	1
of	1
oak	1
or	1
cork	1
trees;	1
for	1
on	1
this	1
point	1
Cide	1
Hamete	1
is	1
not	1
as	1
precise	1
as	1
he	1
usually	1
is	1
on	1
other	1
matters.	1
Master	1
and	1
man	1
dismounted	1
from	1
their	1
beasts,	1
and	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
they	1
had	1
settled	1
themselves	1
at	1
the	1
foot	1
of	1
the	1
trees,	1
Sancho,	1
who	1
had	1
had	1
a	1
good	1
noontide	1
meal	1
that	1
day,	1
let	1
himself,	1
without	1
more	1
ado,	1
pass	1
the	1
gates	1
of	1
sleep.	1
But	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
whom	1
his	1
thoughts,	1
far	1
more	1
than	1
hunger,	1
kept	1
awake,	1
could	1
not	1
close	1
an	1
eye,	1
and	1
roamed	1
in	1
fancy	1
to	1
and	1
fro	1
through	1
all	1
sorts	1
of	1
places.	1
At	1
one	1
moment	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
cave	1
of	1
Montesinos	1
and	1
saw	1
Dulcinea,	1
transformed	1
into	1
a	1
country	1
wench,	1
skipping	1
and	1
mounting	1
upon	1
her	1
she-ass;	1
again	1
that	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
sage	1
Merlin	1
were	1
sounding	1
in	1
his	1
ears,	1
setting	1
forth	1
the	1
conditions	1
to	1
be	1
observed	1
and	1
the	1
exertions	1
to	1
be	1
made	1
for	1
the	1
disenchantment	1
of	1
Dulcinea.	1
He	1
lost	1
all	1
patience	1
when	1
he	1
considered	1
the	1
laziness	1
and	1
want	1
of	1
charity	1
of	1
his	1
squire	1
Sancho;	1
for	1
to	1
the	1
best	1
of	1
his	1
belief	1
he	1
had	1
only	1
given	1
himself	1
five	1
lashes,	1
a	1
number	1
paltry	1
and	1
disproportioned	1
to	1
the	1
vast	1
number	1
required.	1
At	1
this	1
thought	1
he	1
felt	1
such	1
vexation	1
and	1
anger	1
that	1
he	1
reasoned	1
the	1
matter	1
thus:	1
“If	1
Alexander	1
the	1
Great	1
cut	1
the	1
Gordian	1
knot,	1
saying,	1
‘To	1
cut	1
comes	1
to	1
the	1
same	1
thing	1
as	1
to	1
untie,’	1
and	1
yet	1
did	1
not	1
fail	1
to	1
become	1
lord	1
paramount	1
of	1
all	1
Asia,	1
neither	1
more	1
nor	1
less	1
could	1
happen	1
now	1
in	1
Dulcinea’s	1
disenchantment	1
if	1
I	1
scourge	1
Sancho	1
against	1
his	1
will;	1
for,	1
if	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
condition	1
of	1
the	1
remedy	1
that	1
Sancho	1
shall	1
receive	1
three	1
thousand	1
and	1
odd	1
lashes,	1
what	1
does	1
it	1
matter	1
to	1
me	1
whether	1
he	1
inflicts	1
them	1
himself,	1
or	1
someone	1
else	1
inflicts	1
them,	1
when	1
the	1
essential	1
point	1
is	1
that	1
he	1
receives	1
them,	1
let	1
them	1
come	1
from	1
whatever	1
quarter	1
they	1
may?”	1
With	1
this	1
idea	1
he	1
went	1
over	1
to	1
Sancho,	1
having	1
first	1
taken	1
Rocinante’s	1
reins	1
and	1
arranged	1
them	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
flog	1
him	1
with	1
them,	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
untie	1
the	1
points	1
(the	1
common	1
belief	1
is	1
he	1
had	1
but	1
one	1
in	1
front)	1
by	1
which	1
his	1
breeches	1
were	1
held	1
up;	1
but	1
the	1
instant	1
he	1
approached	1
him	1
Sancho	1
woke	1
up	1
in	1
his	1
full	1
senses	1
and	1
cried	1
out,	1
“What	1
is	1
this?	1
Who	1
is	1
touching	1
me	1
and	1
untrussing	1
me?”	1
“It	1
is	1
I,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“and	1
I	1
come	1
to	1
make	1
good	1
thy	1
shortcomings	1
and	1
relieve	1
my	1
own	1
distresses;	1
I	1
come	1
to	1
whip	1
thee,	1
Sancho,	1
and	1
wipe	1
off	1
some	1
portion	1
of	1
the	1
debt	1
thou	1
hast	1
undertaken.	1
Dulcinea	1
is	1
perishing,	1
thou	1
art	1
living	1
on	1
regardless,	1
I	1
am	1
dying	1
of	1
hope	1
deferred;	1
therefore	1
untruss	1
thyself	1
with	1
a	1
good	1
will,	1
for	1
mine	1
it	1
is,	1
here,	1
in	1
this	1
retired	1
spot,	1
to	1
give	1
thee	1
at	1
least	1
two	1
thousand	1
lashes.”	1
“Not	1
a	1
bit	1
of	1
it,”	1
said	1
Sancho;	1
“let	1
your	1
worship	1
keep	1
quiet,	1
or	1
else	1
by	1
the	1
living	1
God	1
the	1
deaf	1
shall	1
hear	1
us;	1
the	1
lashes	1
I	1
pledged	1
myself	1
to	1
must	1
be	1
voluntary	1
and	1
not	1
forced	1
upon	1
me,	1
and	1
just	1
now	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
fancy	1
to	1
whip	1
myself;	1
it	1
is	1
enough	1
if	1
I	1
give	1
you	1
my	1
word	1
to	1
flog	1
and	1
flap	1
myself	1
when	1
I	1
have	1
a	1
mind.”	1
“It	1
will	1
not	1
do	1
to	1
leave	1
it	1
to	1
thy	1
courtesy,	1
Sancho,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“for	1
thou	1
art	1
hard	1
of	1
heart	1
and,	1
though	1
a	1
clown,	1
tender	1
of	1
flesh;”	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
he	1
strove	1
and	1
struggled	1
to	1
untie	1
him.	1
Seeing	1
this	1
Sancho	1
got	1
up,	1
and	1
grappling	1
with	1
his	1
master	1
he	1
gripped	1
him	1
with	1
all	1
his	1
might	1
in	1
his	1
arms,	1
giving	1
him	1
a	1
trip	1
with	1
the	1
heel	1
stretched	1
him	1
on	1
the	1
ground	1
on	1
his	1
back,	1
and	1
pressing	1
his	1
right	1
knee	1
on	1
his	1
chest	1
held	1
his	1
hands	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
neither	1
move	1
nor	1
breathe.	1
“How	1
now,	1
traitor!”	1
exclaimed	1
Don	1
Quixote.	1
“Dost	1
thou	1
revolt	1
against	1
thy	1
master	1
and	1
natural	1
lord?	1
Dost	1
thou	1
rise	1
against	1
him	1
who	1
gives	1
thee	1
his	1
bread?”	1
“I	1
neither	1
put	1
down	1
king,	1
nor	1
set	1
up	1
king,”	1
said	1
Sancho;	1
“I	1
only	1
stand	1
up	1
for	1
myself	1
who	1
am	1
my	1
own	1
lord;	1
if	1
your	1
worship	1
promises	1
me	1
to	1
be	1
quiet,	1
and	1
not	1
to	1
offer	1
to	1
whip	1
me	1
now,	1
I’ll	1
let	1
you	1
go	1
free	1
and	1
unhindered;	1
if	1
not—	1
Traitor	1
and	1
Doña	1
Sancha’s	1
foe,	1
Thou	1
diest	1
on	1
the	1
spot.”	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
gave	1
his	1
promise,	1
and	1
swore	1
by	1
the	1
life	1
of	1
his	1
thoughts	1
not	1
to	1
touch	1
so	1
much	1
as	1
a	1
hair	1
of	1
his	1
garments,	1
and	1
to	1
leave	1
him	1
entirely	1
free	1
and	1
to	1
his	1
own	1
discretion	1
to	1
whip	1
himself	1
whenever	1
he	1
pleased.	1

Sancho	1
rose	1
and	1
removed	1
some	1
distance	1
from	1
the	1
spot,	1
but	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
place	1
himself	1
leaning	1
against	1
another	1
tree	1
he	1
felt	1
something	1
touch	1
his	1
head,	1
and	1
putting	1
up	1
his	1
hands	1
encountered	1
somebody’s	1
two	1
feet	1
with	1
shoes	1
and	1
stockings	1
on	1
them.	1
He	1
trembled	1
with	1
fear	1
and	1
made	1
for	1
another	1
tree,	1
where	1
the	1
very	1
same	1
thing	1
happened	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
fell	1
a-shouting,	1
calling	1
upon	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
to	1
come	1
and	1
protect	1
him.	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
did	1
so,	1
and	1
asked	1
him	1
what	1
had	1
happened	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
afraid	1
of.	1
Sancho	1
replied	1
that	1
all	1
the	1
trees	1
were	1
full	1
of	1
men’s	1
feet	1
and	1
legs.	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
felt	1
them,	1
and	1
guessed	1
at	1
once	1
what	1
it	1
was,	1
and	1
said	1
to	1
Sancho,	1
“Thou	1
hast	1
nothing	1
to	1
be	1
afraid	1
of,	1
for	1
these	1
feet	1
and	1
legs	1
that	1
thou	1
feelest	1
but	1
canst	1
not	1
see	1
belong	1
no	1
doubt	1
to	1
some	1
outlaws	1
and	1
freebooters	1
that	1
have	1
been	1
hanged	1
on	1
these	1
trees;	1
for	1
the	1
authorities	1
in	1
these	1
parts	1
are	1
wont	1
to	1
hang	1
them	1
up	1
by	1
twenties	1
and	1
thirties	1
when	1
they	1
catch	1
them;	1
whereby	1
I	1
conjecture	1
that	1
I	1
must	1
be	1
near	1
Barcelona;”	1
and	1
it	1
was,	1
in	1
fact,	1
as	1
he	1
supposed;	1
with	1
the	1
first	1
light	1
they	1
looked	1
up	1
and	1
saw	1
that	1
the	1
fruit	1
hanging	1
on	1
those	1
trees	1
were	1
freebooters’	1
bodies.	1
And	1
now	1
day	1
dawned;	1
and	1
if	1
the	1
dead	1
freebooters	1
had	1
scared	1
them,	1
their	1
hearts	1
were	1
no	1
less	1
troubled	1
by	1
upwards	1
of	1
forty	1
living	1
ones,	1
who	1
all	1
of	1
a	1
sudden	1
surrounded	1
them,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
Catalan	1
tongue	1
bade	1
them	1
stand	1
and	1
wait	1
until	1
their	1
captain	1
came	1
up.	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
was	1
on	1
foot	1
with	1
his	1
horse	1
unbridled	1
and	1
his	1
lance	1
leaning	1
against	1
a	1
tree,	1
and	1
in	1
short	1
completely	1
defenceless;	1
he	1
thought	1
it	1
best	1
therefore	1
to	1
fold	1
his	1
arms	1
and	1
bow	1
his	1
head	1
and	1
reserve	1
himself	1
for	1
a	1
more	1
favourable	1
occasion	1
and	1
opportunity.	1
The	1
robbers	1
made	1
haste	1
to	1
search	1
Dapple,	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
leave	1
him	1
a	1
single	1
thing	1
of	1
all	1
he	1
carried	1
in	1
the	1
alforjas	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
valise;	1
and	1
lucky	1
it	1
was	1
for	1
Sancho	1
that	1
the	1
duke’s	1
crowns	1
and	1
those	1
he	1
brought	1
from	1
home	1
were	1
in	1
a	1
girdle	1
that	1
he	1
wore	1
round	1
him;	1
but	1
for	1
all	1
that	1
these	1
good	1
folk	1
would	1
have	1
stripped	1
him,	1
and	1
even	1
looked	1
to	1
see	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
hidden	1
between	1
the	1
skin	1
and	1
flesh,	1
but	1
for	1
the	1
arrival	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
of	1
their	1
captain,	1
who	1
was	1
about	1
thirty-four	1
years	1
of	1
age	1
apparently,	1
strongly	1
built,	1
above	1
the	1
middle	1
height,	1
of	1
stern	1
aspect	1
and	1
swarthy	1
complexion.	1
He	1
was	1
mounted	1
upon	1
a	1
powerful	1
horse,	1
and	1
had	1
on	1
a	1
coat	1
of	1
mail,	1
with	1
four	1
of	1
the	1
pistols	1
they	1
call	1
petronels	1
in	1
that	1
country	1
at	1
his	1
waist.	1
He	1
saw	1
that	1
his	1
squires	1
(for	1
so	1
they	1
call	1
those	1
who	1
follow	1
that	1
trade)	1
were	1
about	1
to	1
rifle	1
Sancho	1
Panza,	1
but	1
he	1
ordered	1
them	1
to	1
desist	1
and	1
was	1
at	1
once	1
obeyed,	1
so	1
the	1
girdle	1
escaped.	1
He	1
wondered	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
lance	1
leaning	1
against	1
the	1
tree,	1
the	1
shield	1
on	1
the	1
ground,	1
and	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
in	1
armour	1
and	1
dejected,	1
with	1
the	1
saddest	1
and	1
most	1
melancholy	1
face	1
that	1
sadness	1
itself	1
could	1
produce;	1
and	1
going	1
up	1
to	1
him	1
he	1
said,	1
“Be	1
not	1
so	1
cast	1
down,	1
good	1
man,	1
for	1
you	1
have	1
not	1
fallen	1
into	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
any	1
inhuman	1
Busiris,	1
but	1
into	1
Roque	1
Guinart’s,	1
which	1
are	1
more	1
merciful	1
than	1
cruel.”	1
“The	1
cause	1
of	1
my	1
dejection,”	1
returned	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“is	1
not	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
fallen	1
into	1
thy	1
hands,	1
O	1
valiant	1
Roque,	1
whose	1
fame	1
is	1
bounded	1
by	1
no	1
limits	1
on	1
earth,	1
but	1
that	1
my	1
carelessness	1
should	1
have	1
been	1
so	1
great	1
that	1
thy	1
soldiers	1
should	1
have	1
caught	1
me	1
unbridled,	1
when	1
it	1
is	1
my	1
duty,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
rule	1
of	1
knight-errantry	1
which	1
I	1
profess,	1
to	1
be	1
always	1
on	1
the	1
alert	1
and	1
at	1
all	1
times	1
my	1
own	1
sentinel;	1
for	1
let	1
me	1
tell	1
thee,	1
great	1
Roque,	1
had	1
they	1
found	1
me	1
on	1
my	1
horse,	1
with	1
my	1
lance	1
and	1
shield,	1
it	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
been	1
very	1
easy	1
for	1
them	1
to	1
reduce	1
me	1
to	1
submission,	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
of	1
La	1
Mancha,	1
he	1
who	1
hath	1
filled	1
the	1
whole	1
world	1
with	1
his	1
achievements.”	1
Roque	1
Guinart	1
at	1
once	1
perceived	1
that	1
Don	1
Quixote’s	1
weakness	1
was	1
more	1
akin	1
to	1
madness	1
than	1
to	1
swagger;	1
and	1
though	1
he	1
had	1
sometimes	1
heard	1
him	1
spoken	1
of,	1
he	1
never	1
regarded	1
the	1
things	1
attributed	1
to	1
him	1
as	1
true,	1
nor	1
could	1
he	1
persuade	1
himself	1
that	1
such	1
a	1
humour	1
could	1
become	1
dominant	1
in	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
man;	1
he	1
was	1
extremely	1
glad,	1
therefore,	1
to	1
meet	1
him	1
and	1
test	1
at	1
close	1
quarters	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
heard	1
of	1
him	1
at	1
a	1
distance;	1
so	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
him,	1
“Despair	1
not,	1
valiant	1
knight,	1
nor	1
regard	1
as	1
an	1
untoward	1
fate	1
the	1
position	1
in	1
which	1
thou	1
findest	1
thyself;	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
that	1
by	1
these	1
slips	1
thy	1
crooked	1
fortune	1
will	1
make	1
itself	1
straight;	1
for	1
heaven	1
by	1
strange	1
circuitous	1
ways,	1
mysterious	1
and	1
incomprehensible	1
to	1
man,	1
raises	1
up	1
the	1
fallen	1
and	1
makes	1
rich	1
the	1
poor.”	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
thank	1
him,	1
when	1
they	1
heard	1
behind	1
them	1
a	1
noise	1
as	1
of	1
a	1
troop	1
of	1
horses;	1
there	1
was,	1
however,	1
but	1
one,	1
riding	1
on	1
which	1
at	1
a	1
furious	1
pace	1
came	1
a	1
youth,	1
apparently	1
about	1
twenty	1
years	1
of	1
age,	1
clad	1
in	1
green	1
damask	1
edged	1
with	1
gold	1
and	1
breeches	1
and	1
a	1
loose	1
frock,	1
with	1
a	1
hat	1
looped	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
Walloon	1
fashion,	1
tight-fitting	1
polished	1
boots,	1
gilt	1
spurs,	1
dagger	1
and	1
sword,	1
and	1
in	1
his	1
hand	1
a	1
musketoon,	1
and	1
a	1
pair	1
of	1
pistols	1
at	1
his	1
waist.	1
Roque	1
turned	1
round	1
at	1
the	1
noise	1
and	1
perceived	1
this	1
comely	1
figure,	1
which	1
drawing	1
near	1
thus	1
addressed	1
him,	1
“I	1
came	1
in	1
quest	1
of	1
thee,	1
valiant	1
Roque,	1
to	1
find	1
in	1
thee	1
if	1
not	1
a	1
remedy	1
at	1
least	1
relief	1
in	1
my	1
misfortune;	1
and	1
not	1
to	1
keep	1
thee	1
in	1
suspense,	1
for	1
I	1
see	1
thou	1
dost	1
not	1
recognise	1
me,	1
I	1
will	1
tell	1
thee	1
who	1
I	1
am;	1
I	1
am	1
Claudia	1
Jeronima,	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
Simon	1
Forte,	1
thy	1
good	1
friend,	1
and	1
special	1
enemy	1
of	1
Clauquel	1
Torrellas,	1
who	1
is	1
thine	1
also	1
as	1
being	1
of	1
the	1
faction	1
opposed	1
to	1
thee.	1
Thou	1
knowest	1
that	1
this	1
Torrellas	1
has	1
a	1
son	1
who	1
is	1
called,	1
or	1
at	1
least	1
was	1
not	1
two	1
hours	1
since,	1
Don	1
Vicente	1
Torrellas.	1
Well,	1
to	1
cut	1
short	1
the	1
tale	1
of	1
my	1
misfortune,	1
I	1
will	1
tell	1
thee	1
in	1
a	1
few	1
words	1
what	1
this	1
youth	1
has	1
brought	1
upon	1
me.	1
He	1
saw	1
me,	1
he	1
paid	1
court	1
to	1
me,	1
I	1
listened	1
to	1
him,	1
and,	1
unknown	1
to	1
my	1
father,	1
I	1
loved	1
him;	1
for	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
woman,	1
however	1
secluded	1
she	1
may	1
live	1
or	1
close	1
she	1
may	1
be	1
kept,	1
who	1
will	1
not	1
have	1
opportunities	1
and	1
to	1
spare	1
for	1
following	1
her	1
headlong	1
impulses.	1
In	1
a	1
word,	1
he	1
pledged	1
himself	1
to	1
be	1
mine,	1
and	1
I	1
promised	1
to	1
be	1
his,	1
without	1
carrying	1
matters	1
any	1
further.	1
Yesterday	1
I	1
learned	1
that,	1
forgetful	1
of	1
his	1
pledge	1
to	1
me,	1
he	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
marry	1
another,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
to	1
go	1
this	1
morning	1
to	1
plight	1
his	1
troth,	1
intelligence	1
which	1
overwhelmed	1
and	1
exasperated	1
me;	1
my	1
father	1
not	1
being	1
at	1
home	1
I	1
was	1
able	1
to	1
adopt	1
this	1
costume	1
you	1
see,	1
and	1
urging	1
my	1
horse	1
to	1
speed	1
I	1
overtook	1
Don	1
Vicente	1
about	1
a	1
league	1
from	1
this,	1
and	1
without	1
waiting	1
to	1
utter	1
reproaches	1
or	1
hear	1
excuses	1
I	1
fired	1
this	1
musket	1
at	1
him,	1
and	1
these	1
two	1
pistols	1
besides,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
best	1
of	1
my	1
belief	1
I	1
must	1
have	1
lodged	1
more	1
than	1
two	1
bullets	1
in	1
his	1
body,	1
opening	1
doors	1
to	1
let	1
my	1
honour	1
go	1
free,	1
enveloped	1
in	1
his	1
blood.	1
I	1
left	1
him	1
there	1
in	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
his	1
servants,	1
who	1
did	1
not	1
dare	1
and	1
were	1
not	1
able	1
to	1
interfere	1
in	1
his	1
defence,	1
and	1
I	1
come	1
to	1
seek	1
from	1
thee	1
a	1
safe-conduct	1
into	1
France,	1
where	1
I	1
have	1
relatives	1
with	1
whom	1
I	1
can	1
live;	1
and	1
also	1
to	1
implore	1
thee	1
to	1
protect	1
my	1
father,	1
so	1
that	1
Don	1
Vicente’s	1
numerous	1
kinsmen	1
may	1
not	1
venture	1
to	1
wreak	1
their	1
lawless	1
vengeance	1
upon	1
him.”	1
Roque,	1
filled	1
with	1
admiration	1
at	1
the	1
gallant	1
bearing,	1
high	1
spirit,	1
comely	1
figure,	1
and	1
adventure	1
of	1
the	1
fair	1
Claudia,	1
said	1
to	1
her,	1
“Come,	1
señora,	1
let	1
us	1
go	1
and	1
see	1
if	1
thy	1
enemy	1
is	1
dead;	1
and	1
then	1
we	1
will	1
consider	1
what	1
will	1
be	1
best	1
for	1
thee.”	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
listening	1
to	1
what	1
Claudia	1
said	1
and	1
Roque	1
Guinart	1
said	1
in	1
reply	1
to	1
her,	1
exclaimed,	1
“Nobody	1
need	1
trouble	1
himself	1
with	1
the	1
defence	1
of	1
this	1
lady,	1
for	1
I	1
take	1
it	1
upon	1
myself.	1
Give	1
me	1
my	1
horse	1
and	1
arms,	1
and	1
wait	1
for	1
me	1
here;	1
I	1
will	1
go	1
in	1
quest	1
of	1
this	1
knight,	1
and	1
dead	1
or	1
alive	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
him	1
keep	1
his	1
word	1
plighted	1
to	1
so	1
great	1
beauty.”	1
“Nobody	1
need	1
have	1
any	1
doubt	1
about	1
that,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“for	1
my	1
master	1
has	1
a	1
very	1
happy	1
knack	1
of	1
matchmaking;	1
it’s	1
not	1
many	1
days	1
since	1
he	1
forced	1
another	1
man	1
to	1
marry,	1
who	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
way	1
backed	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
promise	1
to	1
another	1
maiden;	1
and	1
if	1
it	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
for	1
his	1
persecutors	1
the	1
enchanters	1
changing	1
the	1
man’s	1
proper	1
shape	1
into	1
a	1
lacquey’s	1
the	1
said	1
maiden	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
one	1
this	1
minute.”	1
Roque,	1
who	1
was	1
paying	1
more	1
attention	1
to	1
the	1
fair	1
Claudia’s	1
adventure	1
than	1
to	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
master	1
or	1
man,	1
did	1
not	1
hear	1
them;	1
and	1
ordering	1
his	1
squires	1
to	1
restore	1
to	1
Sancho	1
everything	1
they	1
had	1
stripped	1
Dapple	1
of,	1
he	1
directed	1
them	1
to	1
return	1
to	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
quartered	1
during	1
the	1
night,	1
and	1
then	1
set	1
off	1
with	1
Claudia	1
at	1
full	1
speed	1
in	1
search	1
of	1
the	1
wounded	1
or	1
slain	1
Don	1
Vicente.	1
They	1
reached	1
the	1
spot	1
where	1
Claudia	1
met	1
him,	1
but	1
found	1
nothing	1
there	1
save	1
freshly	1
spilt	1
blood;	1
looking	1
all	1
round,	1
however,	1
they	1
descried	1
some	1
people	1
on	1
the	1
slope	1
of	1
a	1
hill	1
above	1
them,	1
and	1
concluded,	1
as	1
indeed	1
it	1
proved	1
to	1
be,	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
Don	1
Vicente,	1
whom	1
either	1
dead	1
or	1
alive	1
his	1
servants	1
were	1
removing	1
to	1
attend	1
to	1
his	1
wounds	1
or	1
to	1
bury	1
him.	1
They	1
made	1
haste	1
to	1
overtake	1
them,	1
which,	1
as	1
the	1
party	1
moved	1
slowly,	1
they	1
were	1
able	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
ease.	1
They	1
found	1
Don	1
Vicente	1
in	1
the	1
arms	1
of	1
his	1
servants,	1
whom	1
he	1
was	1
entreating	1
in	1
a	1
broken	1
feeble	1
voice	1
to	1
leave	1
him	1
there	1
to	1
die,	1
as	1
the	1
pain	1
of	1
his	1
wounds	1
would	1
not	1
suffer	1
him	1
to	1
go	1
any	1
farther.	1
Claudia	1
and	1
Roque	1
threw	1
themselves	1
off	1
their	1
horses	1
and	1
advanced	1
towards	1
him;	1
the	1
servants	1
were	1
overawed	1
by	1
the	1
appearance	1
of	1
Roque,	1
and	1
Claudia	1
was	1
moved	1
by	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
Don	1
Vicente,	1
and	1
going	1
up	1
to	1
him	1
half	1
tenderly	1
half	1
sternly,	1
she	1
seized	1
his	1
hand	1
and	1
said	1
to	1
him,	1
“Hadst	1
thou	1
given	1
me	1
this	1
according	1
to	1
our	1
compact	1
thou	1
hadst	1
never	1
come	1
to	1
this	1
pass.”	1
The	1
wounded	1
gentleman	1
opened	1
his	1
all	1
but	1
closed	1
eyes,	1
and	1
recognising	1
Claudia	1
said,	1
“I	1
see	1
clearly,	1
fair	1
and	1
mistaken	1
lady,	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
thou	1
that	1
hast	1
slain	1
me,	1
a	1
punishment	1
not	1
merited	1
or	1
deserved	1
by	1
my	1
feelings	1
towards	1
thee,	1
for	1
never	1
did	1
I	1
mean	1
to,	1
nor	1
could	1
I,	1
wrong	1
thee	1
in	1
thought	1
or	1
deed.”	1
“It	1
is	1
not	1
true,	1
then,”	1
said	1
Claudia,	1
“that	1
thou	1
wert	1
going	1
this	1
morning	1
to	1
marry	1
Leonora	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
the	1
rich	1
Balvastro?”	1
“Assuredly	1
not,”	1
replied	1
Don	1
Vicente;	1
“my	1
cruel	1
fortune	1
must	1
have	1
carried	1
those	1
tidings	1
to	1
thee	1
to	1
drive	1
thee	1
in	1
thy	1
jealousy	1
to	1
take	1
my	1
life;	1
and	1
to	1
assure	1
thyself	1
of	1
this,	1
press	1
my	1
hands	1
and	1
take	1
me	1
for	1
thy	1
husband	1
if	1
thou	1
wilt;	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
better	1
satisfaction	1
to	1
offer	1
thee	1
for	1
the	1
wrong	1
thou	1
fanciest	1
thou	1
hast	1
received	1
from	1
me.”	1
Claudia	1
wrung	1
his	1
hands,	1
and	1
her	1
own	1
heart	1
was	1
so	1
wrung	1
that	1
she	1
lay	1
fainting	1
on	1
the	1
bleeding	1
breast	1
of	1
Don	1
Vicente,	1
whom	1
a	1
death	1
spasm	1
seized	1
the	1
same	1
instant.	1
Roque	1
was	1
in	1
perplexity	1
and	1
knew	1
not	1
what	1
to	1
do;	1
the	1
servants	1
ran	1
to	1
fetch	1
water	1
to	1
sprinkle	1
their	1
faces,	1
and	1
brought	1
some	1
and	1
bathed	1
them	1
with	1
it.	1
Claudia	1
recovered	1
from	1
her	1
fainting	1
fit,	1
but	1
not	1
so	1
Don	1
Vicente	1
from	1
the	1
paroxysm	1
that	1
had	1
overtaken	1
him,	1
for	1
his	1
life	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
an	1
end.	1
On	1
perceiving	1
this,	1
Claudia,	1
when	1
she	1
had	1
convinced	1
herself	1
that	1
her	1
beloved	1
husband	1
was	1
no	1
more,	1
rent	1
the	1
air	1
with	1
her	1
sighs	1
and	1
made	1
the	1
heavens	1
ring	1
with	1
her	1
lamentations;	1
she	1
tore	1
her	1
hair	1
and	1
scattered	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
winds,	1
she	1
beat	1
her	1
face	1
with	1
her	1
hands	1
and	1
showed	1
all	1
the	1
signs	1
of	1
grief	1
and	1
sorrow	1
that	1
could	1
be	1
conceived	1
to	1
come	1
from	1
an	1
afflicted	1
heart.	1
“Cruel,	1
reckless	1
woman!”	1
she	1
cried,	1
“how	1
easily	1
wert	1
thou	1
moved	1
to	1
carry	1
out	1
a	1
thought	1
so	1
wicked!	1
O	1
furious	1
force	1
of	1
jealousy,	1
to	1
what	1
desperate	1
lengths	1
dost	1
thou	1
lead	1
those	1
that	1
give	1
thee	1
lodging	1
in	1
their	1
bosoms!	1
O	1
husband,	1
whose	1
unhappy	1
fate	1
in	1
being	1
mine	1
hath	1
borne	1
thee	1
from	1
the	1
marriage	1
bed	1
to	1
the	1
grave!”	1
So	1
vehement	1
and	1
so	1
piteous	1
were	1
the	1
lamentations	1
of	1
Claudia	1
that	1
they	1
drew	1
tears	1
from	1
Roque’s	1
eyes,	1
unused	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
to	1
shed	1
them	1
on	1
any	1
occasion.	1
The	1
servants	1
wept,	1
Claudia	1
swooned	1
away	1
again	1
and	1
again,	1
and	1
the	1
whole	1
place	1
seemed	1
a	1
field	1
of	1
sorrow	1
and	1
an	1
abode	1
of	1
misfortune.	1
In	1
the	1
end	1
Roque	1
Guinart	1
directed	1
Don	1
Vicente’s	1
servants	1
to	1
carry	1
his	1
body	1
to	1
his	1
father’s	1
village,	1
which	1
was	1
close	1
by,	1
for	1
burial.	1
Claudia	1
told	1
him	1
she	1
meant	1
to	1
go	1
to	1
a	1
monastery	1
of	1
which	1
an	1
aunt	1
of	1
hers	1
was	1
abbess,	1
where	1
she	1
intended	1
to	1
pass	1
her	1
life	1
with	1
a	1
better	1
and	1
everlasting	1
spouse.	1
He	1
applauded	1
her	1
pious	1
resolution,	1
and	1
offered	1
to	1
accompany	1
her	1
whithersoever	1
she	1
wished,	1
and	1
to	1
protect	1
her	1
father	1
against	1
the	1
kinsmen	1
of	1
Don	1
Vicente	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
world,	1
should	1
they	1
seek	1
to	1
injure	1
him.	1
Claudia	1
would	1
not	1
on	1
any	1
account	1
allow	1
him	1
to	1
accompany	1
her;	1
and	1
thanking	1
him	1
for	1
his	1
offers	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
she	1
could,	1
took	1
leave	1
of	1
him	1
in	1
tears.	1
The	1
servants	1
of	1
Don	1
Vicente	1
carried	1
away	1
his	1
body,	1
and	1
Roque	1
returned	1
to	1
his	1
comrades,	1
and	1
so	1
ended	1
the	1
love	1
of	1
Claudia	1
Jeronima;	1
but	1
what	1
wonder,	1
when	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
insuperable	1
and	1
cruel	1
might	1
of	1
jealousy	1
that	1
wove	1
the	1
web	1
of	1
her	1
sad	1
story?	1

Roque	1
Guinart	1
found	1
his	1
squires	1
at	1
the	1
place	1
to	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
ordered	1
them,	1
and	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
on	1
Rocinante	1
in	1
the	1
midst	1
of	1
them	1
delivering	1
a	1
harangue	1
to	1
them	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
urged	1
them	1
to	1
give	1
up	1
a	1
mode	1
of	1
life	1
so	1
full	1
of	1
peril,	1
as	1
well	1
to	1
the	1
soul	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
body;	1
but	1
as	1
most	1
of	1
them	1
were	1
Gascons,	1
rough	1
lawless	1
fellows,	1
his	1
speech	1
did	1
not	1
make	1
much	1
impression	1
on	1
them.	1
Roque	1
on	1
coming	1
up	1
asked	1
Sancho	1
if	1
his	1
men	1
had	1
returned	1
and	1
restored	1
to	1
him	1
the	1
treasures	1
and	1
jewels	1
they	1
had	1
stripped	1
off	1
Dapple.	1
Sancho	1
said	1
they	1
had,	1
but	1
that	1
three	1
kerchiefs	1
that	1
were	1
worth	1
three	1
cities	1
were	1
missing.	1
“What	1
are	1
you	1
talking	1
about,	1
man?”	1
said	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
bystanders;	1
“I	1
have	1
got	1
them,	1
and	1
they	1
are	1
not	1
worth	1
three	1
reals.”	1
“That	1
is	1
true,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
“but	1
my	1
squire	1
values	1
them	1
at	1
the	1
rate	1
he	1
says,	1
as	1
having	1
been	1
given	1
me	1
by	1
the	1
person	1
who	1
gave	1
them.”	1
Roque	1
Guinart	1
ordered	1
them	1
to	1
be	1
restored	1
at	1
once;	1
and	1
making	1
his	1
men	1
fall	1
in	1
in	1
line	1
he	1
directed	1
all	1
the	1
clothing,	1
jewellery,	1
and	1
money	1
that	1
they	1
had	1
taken	1
since	1
the	1
last	1
distribution	1
to	1
be	1
produced;	1
and	1
making	1
a	1
hasty	1
valuation,	1
and	1
reducing	1
what	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
divided	1
into	1
money,	1
he	1
made	1
shares	1
for	1
the	1
whole	1
band	1
so	1
equitably	1
and	1
carefully,	1
that	1
in	1
no	1
case	1
did	1
he	1
exceed	1
or	1
fall	1
short	1
of	1
strict	1
distributive	1
justice.	1
When	1
this	1
had	1
been	1
done,	1
and	1
all	1
left	1
satisfied,	1
Roque	1
observed	1
to	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“If	1
this	1
scrupulous	1
exactness	1
were	1
not	1
observed	1
with	1
these	1
fellows	1
there	1
would	1
be	1
no	1
living	1
with	1
them.”	1
Upon	1
this	1
Sancho	1
remarked,	1
“From	1
what	1
I	1
have	1
seen	1
here,	1
justice	1
is	1
such	1
a	1
good	1
thing	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
doing	1
without	1
it,	1
even	1
among	1
the	1
thieves	1
themselves.”	1
One	1
of	1
the	1
squires	1
heard	1
this,	1
and	1
raising	1
the	1
butt-end	1
of	1
his	1
harquebuss	1
would	1
no	1
doubt	1
have	1
broken	1
Sancho’s	1
head	1
with	1
it	1
had	1
not	1
Roque	1
Guinart	1
called	1
out	1
to	1
him	1
to	1
hold	1
his	1
hand.	1
Sancho	1
was	1
frightened	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
wits,	1
and	1
vowed	1
not	1
to	1
open	1
his	1
lips	1
so	1
long	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
company	1
of	1
these	1
people.	1
At	1
this	1
instant	1
one	1
or	1
two	1
of	1
those	1
squires	1
who	1
were	1
posted	1
as	1
sentinels	1
on	1
the	1
roads,	1
to	1
watch	1
who	1
came	1
along	1
them	1
and	1
report	1
what	1
passed	1
to	1
their	1
chief,	1
came	1
up	1
and	1
said,	1
“Señor,	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
great	1
troop	1
of	1
people	1
not	1
far	1
off	1
coming	1
along	1
the	1
road	1
to	1
Barcelona.”	1
To	1
which	1
Roque	1
replied,	1
“Hast	1
thou	1
made	1
out	1
whether	1
they	1
are	1
of	1
the	1
sort	1
that	1
are	1
after	1
us,	1
or	1
of	1
the	1
sort	1
we	1
are	1
after?”	1
“The	1
sort	1
we	1
are	1
after,”	1
said	1
the	1
squire.	1
“Well	1
then,	1
away	1
with	1
you	1
all,”	1
said	1
Roque,	1
“and	1
bring	1
them	1
here	1
to	1
me	1
at	1
once	1
without	1
letting	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
escape.”	1

They	1
obeyed,	1
and	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
Sancho,	1
and	1
Roque,	1
left	1
by	1
themselves,	1
waited	1
to	1
see	1
what	1
the	1
squires	1
brought,	1
and	1
while	1
they	1
were	1
waiting	1
Roque	1
said	1
to	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“It	1
must	1
seem	1
a	1
strange	1
sort	1
of	1
life	1
to	1
Señor	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
this	1
of	1
ours,	1
strange	1
adventures,	1
strange	1
incidents,	1
and	1
all	1
full	1
of	1
danger;	1
and	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
wonder	1
that	1
it	1
should	1
seem	1
so,	1
for	1
in	1
truth	1
I	1
must	1
own	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
mode	1
of	1
life	1
more	1
restless	1
or	1
anxious	1
than	1
ours.	1
What	1
led	1
me	1
into	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
certain	1
thirst	1
for	1
vengeance,	1
which	1
is	1
strong	1
enough	1
to	1
disturb	1
the	1
quietest	1
hearts.	1
I	1
am	1
by	1
nature	1
tender-hearted	1
and	1
kindly,	1
but,	1
as	1
I	1
said,	1
the	1
desire	1
to	1
revenge	1
myself	1
for	1
a	1
wrong	1
that	1
was	1
done	1
me	1
so	1
overturns	1
all	1
my	1
better	1
impulses	1
that	1
I	1
keep	1
on	1
in	1
this	1
way	1
of	1
life	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
what	1
conscience	1
tells	1
me;	1
and	1
as	1
one	1
depth	1
calls	1
to	1
another,	1
and	1
one	1
sin	1
to	1
another	1
sin,	1
revenges	1
have	1
linked	1
themselves	1
together,	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
taken	1
upon	1
myself	1
not	1
only	1
my	1
own	1
but	1
those	1
of	1
others:	1
it	1
pleases	1
God,	1
however,	1
that,	1
though	1
I	1
see	1
myself	1
in	1
this	1
maze	1
of	1
entanglements,	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
lose	1
all	1
hope	1
of	1
escaping	1
from	1
it	1
and	1
reaching	1
a	1
safe	1
port.”	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
was	1
amazed	1
to	1
hear	1
Roque	1
utter	1
such	1
excellent	1
and	1
just	1
sentiments,	1
for	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
think	1
that	1
among	1
those	1
who	1
followed	1
such	1
trades	1
as	1
robbing,	1
murdering,	1
and	1
waylaying,	1
there	1
could	1
be	1
anyone	1
capable	1
of	1
a	1
virtuous	1
thought,	1
and	1
he	1
said	1
in	1
reply,	1
“Señor	1
Roque,	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
health	1
lies	1
in	1
knowing	1
the	1
disease	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
sick	1
man’s	1
willingness	1
to	1
take	1
the	1
medicines	1
which	1
the	1
physician	1
prescribes;	1
you	1
are	1
sick,	1
you	1
know	1
what	1
ails	1
you,	1
and	1
heaven,	1
or	1
more	1
properly	1
speaking	1
God,	1
who	1
is	1
our	1
physician,	1
will	1
administer	1
medicines	1
that	1
will	1
cure	1
you,	1
and	1
cure	1
gradually,	1
and	1
not	1
of	1
a	1
sudden	1
or	1
by	1
a	1
miracle;	1
besides,	1
sinners	1
of	1
discernment	1
are	1
nearer	1
amendment	1
than	1
those	1
who	1
are	1
fools;	1
and	1
as	1
your	1
worship	1
has	1
shown	1
good	1
sense	1
in	1
your	1
remarks,	1
all	1
you	1
have	1
to	1
do	1
is	1
to	1
keep	1
up	1
a	1
good	1
heart	1
and	1
trust	1
that	1
the	1
weakness	1
of	1
your	1
conscience	1
will	1
be	1
strengthened.	1
And	1
if	1
you	1
have	1
any	1
desire	1
to	1
shorten	1
the	1
journey	1
and	1
put	1
yourself	1
easily	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
salvation,	1
come	1
with	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
show	1
you	1
how	1
to	1
become	1
a	1
knight-errant,	1
a	1
calling	1
wherein	1
so	1
many	1
hardships	1
and	1
mishaps	1
are	1
encountered	1
that	1
if	1
they	1
be	1
taken	1
as	1
penances	1
they	1
will	1
lodge	1
you	1
in	1
heaven	1
in	1
a	1
trice.”	1
Roque	1
laughed	1
at	1
Don	1
Quixote’s	1
exhortation,	1
and	1
changing	1
the	1
conversation	1
he	1
related	1
the	1
tragic	1
affair	1
of	1
Claudia	1
Jeronima,	1
at	1
which	1
Sancho	1
was	1
extremely	1
grieved;	1
for	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
found	1
the	1
young	1
woman’s	1
beauty,	1
boldness,	1
and	1
spirit	1
at	1
all	1
amiss.	1
And	1
now	1
the	1
squires	1
despatched	1
to	1
make	1
the	1
prize	1
came	1
up,	1
bringing	1
with	1
them	1
two	1
gentlemen	1
on	1
horseback,	1
two	1
pilgrims	1
on	1
foot,	1
and	1
a	1
coach	1
full	1
of	1
women	1
with	1
some	1
six	1
servants	1
on	1
foot	1
and	1
on	1
horseback	1
in	1
attendance	1
on	1
them,	1
and	1
a	1
couple	1
of	1
muleteers	1
whom	1
the	1
gentlemen	1
had	1
with	1
them.	1
The	1
squires	1
made	1
a	1
ring	1
round	1
them,	1
both	1
victors	1
and	1
vanquished	1
maintaining	1
profound	1
silence,	1
waiting	1
for	1
the	1
great	1
Roque	1
Guinart	1
to	1
speak.	1
He	1
asked	1
the	1
gentlemen	1
who	1
they	1
were,	1
whither	1
they	1
were	1
going,	1
and	1
what	1
money	1
they	1
carried	1
with	1
them;	1
“Señor,”	1
replied	1
one	1
of	1
them,	1
“we	1
are	1
two	1
captains	1
of	1
Spanish	1
infantry;	1
our	1
companies	1
are	1
at	1
Naples,	1
and	1
we	1
are	1
on	1
our	1
way	1
to	1
embark	1
in	1
four	1
galleys	1
which	1
they	1
say	1
are	1
at	1
Barcelona	1
under	1
orders	1
for	1
Sicily;	1
and	1
we	1
have	1
about	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
hundred	1
crowns,	1
with	1
which	1
we	1
are,	1
according	1
to	1
our	1
notions,	1
rich	1
and	1
contented,	1
for	1
a	1
soldier’s	1
poverty	1
does	1
not	1
allow	1
a	1
more	1
extensive	1
hoard.”	1
Roque	1
asked	1
the	1
pilgrims	1
the	1
same	1
questions	1
he	1
had	1
put	1
to	1
the	1
captains,	1
and	1
was	1
answered	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
going	1
to	1
take	1
ship	1
for	1
Rome,	1
and	1
that	1
between	1
them	1
they	1
might	1
have	1
about	1
sixty	1
reals.	1
He	1
asked	1
also	1
who	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
coach,	1
whither	1
they	1
were	1
bound	1
and	1
what	1
money	1
they	1
had,	1
and	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
men	1
on	1
horseback	1
replied,	1
“The	1
persons	1
in	1
the	1
coach	1
are	1
my	1
lady	1
Doña	1
Guiomar	1
de	1
Quiñones,	1
wife	1
of	1
the	1
regent	1
of	1
the	1
Vicaria	1
at	1
Naples,	1
her	1
little	1
daughter,	1
a	1
handmaid	1
and	1
a	1
duenna;	1
we	1
six	1
servants	1
are	1
in	1
attendance	1
upon	1
her,	1
and	1
the	1
money	1
amounts	1
to	1
six	1
hundred	1
crowns.”	1
“So	1
then,”	1
said	1
Roque	1
Guinart,	1
“we	1
have	1
got	1
here	1
nine	1
hundred	1
crowns	1
and	1
sixty	1
reals;	1
my	1
soldiers	1
must	1
number	1
some	1
sixty;	1
see	1
how	1
much	1
there	1
falls	1
to	1
each,	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
bad	1
arithmetician.”	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
the	1
robbers	1
heard	1
this	1
they	1
raised	1
a	1
shout	1
of	1
“Long	1
life	1
to	1
Roque	1
Guinart,	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
the	1
lladres	1
that	1
seek	1
his	1
ruin!”	1
The	1
captains	1
showed	1
plainly	1
the	1
concern	1
they	1
felt,	1
the	1
regent’s	1
lady	1
was	1
downcast,	1
and	1
the	1
pilgrims	1
did	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
enjoy	1
seeing	1
their	1
property	1
confiscated.	1
Roque	1
kept	1
them	1
in	1
suspense	1
in	1
this	1
way	1
for	1
a	1
while;	1
but	1
he	1
had	1
no	1
desire	1
to	1
prolong	1
their	1
distress,	1
which	1
might	1
be	1
seen	1
a	1
bowshot	1
off,	1
and	1
turning	1
to	1
the	1
captains	1
he	1
said,	1
“Sirs,	1
will	1
your	1
worships	1
be	1
pleased	1
of	1
your	1
courtesy	1
to	1
lend	1
me	1
sixty	1
crowns,	1
and	1
her	1
ladyship	1
the	1
regent’s	1
wife	1
eighty,	1
to	1
satisfy	1
this	1
band	1
that	1
follows	1
me,	1
for	1
‘it	1
is	1
by	1
his	1
singing	1
the	1
abbot	1
gets	1
his	1
dinner;’	1
and	1
then	1
you	1
may	1
at	1
once	1
proceed	1
on	1
your	1
journey,	1
free	1
and	1
unhindered,	1
with	1
a	1
safe-conduct	1
which	1
I	1
shall	1
give	1
you,	1
so	1
that	1
if	1
you	1
come	1
across	1
any	1
other	1
bands	1
of	1
mine	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
scattered	1
in	1
these	1
parts,	1
they	1
may	1
do	1
you	1
no	1
harm;	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
intention	1
of	1
doing	1
injury	1
to	1
soldiers,	1
or	1
to	1
any	1
woman,	1
especially	1
one	1
of	1
quality.”	1
Profuse	1
and	1
hearty	1
were	1
the	1
expressions	1
of	1
gratitude	1
with	1
which	1
the	1
captains	1
thanked	1
Roque	1
for	1
his	1
courtesy	1
and	1
generosity;	1
for	1
such	1
they	1
regarded	1
his	1
leaving	1
them	1
their	1
own	1
money.	1
Señora	1
Doña	1
Guiomar	1
de	1
Quiñones	1
wanted	1
to	1
throw	1
herself	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
coach	1
to	1
kiss	1
the	1
feet	1
and	1
hands	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
Roque,	1
but	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
suffer	1
it	1
on	1
any	1
account;	1
so	1
far	1
from	1
that,	1
he	1
begged	1
her	1
pardon	1
for	1
the	1
wrong	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
her	1
under	1
pressure	1
of	1
the	1
inexorable	1
necessities	1
of	1
his	1
unfortunate	1
calling.	1
The	1
regent’s	1
lady	1
ordered	1
one	1
of	1
her	1
servants	1
to	1
give	1
the	1
eighty	1
crowns	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
assessed	1
as	1
her	1
share	1
at	1
once,	1
for	1
the	1
captains	1
had	1
already	1
paid	1
down	1
their	1
sixty.	1
The	1
pilgrims	1
were	1
about	1
to	1
give	1
up	1
the	1
whole	1
of	1
their	1
little	1
hoard,	1
but	1
Roque	1
bade	1
them	1
keep	1
quiet,	1
and	1
turning	1
to	1
his	1
men	1
he	1
said,	1
“Of	1
these	1
crowns	1
two	1
fall	1
to	1
each	1
man	1
and	1
twenty	1
remain	1
over;	1
let	1
ten	1
be	1
given	1
to	1
these	1
pilgrims,	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
ten	1
to	1
this	1
worthy	1
squire	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
speak	1
favourably	1
of	1
this	1
adventure;”	1
and	1
then	1
having	1
writing	1
materials,	1
with	1
which	1
he	1
always	1
went	1
provided,	1
brought	1
to	1
him,	1
he	1
gave	1
them	1
in	1
writing	1
a	1
safe-conduct	1
to	1
the	1
leaders	1
of	1
his	1
bands;	1
and	1
bidding	1
them	1
farewell	1
let	1
them	1
go	1
free	1
and	1
filled	1
with	1
admiration	1
at	1
his	1
magnanimity,	1
his	1
generous	1
disposition,	1
and	1
his	1
unusual	1
conduct,	1
and	1
inclined	1
to	1
regard	1
him	1
as	1
an	1
Alexander	1
the	1
Great	1
rather	1
than	1
a	1
notorious	1
robber.	1
One	1
of	1
the	1
squires	1
observed	1
in	1
his	1
mixture	1
of	1
Gascon	1
and	1
Catalan,	1
“This	1
captain	1
of	1
ours	1
would	1
make	1
a	1
better	1
friar	1
than	1
highwayman;	1
if	1
he	1
wants	1
to	1
be	1
so	1
generous	1
another	1
time,	1
let	1
it	1
be	1
with	1
his	1
own	1
property	1
and	1
not	1
ours.”	1

The	1
unlucky	1
wight	1
did	1
not	1
speak	1
so	1
low	1
but	1
that	1
Roque	1
overheard	1
him,	1
and	1
drawing	1
his	1
sword	1
almost	1
split	1
his	1
head	1
in	1
two,	1
saying,	1
“That	1
is	1
the	1
way	1
I	1
punish	1
impudent	1
saucy	1
fellows.”	1
They	1
were	1
all	1
taken	1
aback,	1
and	1
not	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
dared	1
to	1
utter	1
a	1
word,	1
such	1
deference	1
did	1
they	1
pay	1
him.	1
Roque	1
then	1
withdrew	1
to	1
one	1
side	1
and	1
wrote	1
a	1
letter	1
to	1
a	1
friend	1
of	1
his	1
at	1
Barcelona,	1
telling	1
him	1
that	1
the	1
famous	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
of	1
La	1
Mancha,	1
the	1
knight-errant	1
of	1
whom	1
there	1
was	1
so	1
much	1
talk,	1
was	1
with	1
him,	1
and	1
was,	1
he	1
assured	1
him,	1
the	1
drollest	1
and	1
wisest	1
man	1
in	1
the	1
world;	1
and	1
that	1
in	1
four	1
days	1
from	1
that	1
date,	1
that	1
is	1
to	1
say,	1
on	1
Saint	1
John	1
the	1
Baptist’s	1

he	1
was	1
going	1

him	1
in	1
full	1
armour	1
mounted	1
on	1
his	1
horse	1
Rocinante,	1
together	1
with	1
his	1
squire	1
Sancho	1
on	1
an	1
ass,	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
strand	1
of	1
the	1

and	1
bidding	1
him	1

notice	1
of	1
this	1
to	1
his	1
friends	1
the	1
Niarros,	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
divert	1
themselves	1
with	1
him.	1
He	1
wished,	1
he	1
said,	1
his	1
enemies	1
the	1
Cadells	1
could	1
be	1
deprived	1
of	1
this	1
pleasure;	1
but	1
that	1
was	1
impossible,	1
because	1
the	1
crazes	1

shrewd	1
sayings	1
of	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
and	1
the	1
humours	1
of	1
his	1

Sancho	1
Panza	1
could	1
not	1

giving	1
general	1
pleasure	1

He	1
despatched	1
the	1

one	1
of	1
his	1
squires,	1
who,	1
exchanging	1
the	1
costume	1
of	1
a	1
highwayman	1
for	1
that	1
of	1
a	1
peasant,	1
made	1
his	1

into	1
Barcelona	1
and	1
gave	1
it	1

whom	1
it	1

Don	1
Quixote	1
passed	1
three	1
days	1
and	1
three	1
nights	1
with	1
Roque,	1
and	1
had	1
he	1
passed	1
three	1
hundred	1
years	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
found	1
enough	1
to	1
observe	1
and	1
wonder	1
at	1
in	1
his	1
mode	1
of	1
life.	1
At	1
daybreak	1
they	1
were	1
in	1
one	1
spot,	1
at	1
dinner-time	1
in	1
another;	1
sometimes	1
they	1
fled	1
without	1
knowing	1
from	1
whom,	1
at	1
other	1
times	1
they	1
lay	1
in	1
wait,	1
not	1
knowing	1
for	1
what.	1
They	1
slept	1
standing,	1
breaking	1
their	1
slumbers	1
to	1
shift	1
from	1
place	1
to	1
place.	1
There	1
was	1
nothing	1
but	1
sending	1
out	1
spies	1
and	1
scouts,	1
posting	1
sentinels	1
and	1
blowing	1
the	1
matches	1
of	1
harquebusses,	1
though	1
they	1
carried	1
but	1
few,	1
for	1
almost	1
all	1
used	1
flintlocks.	1
Roque	1
passed	1
his	1
nights	1
in	1
some	1
place	1
or	1
other	1
apart	1
from	1
his	1
men,	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
not	1
know	1
where	1
he	1
was,	1
for	1
the	1
many	1
proclamations	1
the	1
viceroy	1
of	1
Barcelona	1
had	1
issued	1
against	1
his	1
life	1
kept	1
him	1
in	1
fear	1
and	1
uneasiness,	1
and	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
venture	1
to	1
trust	1
anyone,	1
afraid	1
that	1
even	1
his	1
own	1
men	1
would	1
kill	1
him	1
or	1
deliver	1
him	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
authorities;	1
of	1
a	1
truth,	1
a	1
weary	1
miserable	1
life!	1
At	1
length,	1
by	1
unfrequented	1
roads,	1
short	1
cuts,	1
and	1
secret	1
paths,	1
Roque,	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
and	1
Sancho,	1
together	1
with	1
six	1
squires,	1
set	1
out	1
for	1
Barcelona.	1
They	1
reached	1
the	1
strand	1
on	1
Saint	1
John’s	1
Eve	1
during	1
the	1
night;	1
and	1
Roque,	1
after	1
embracing	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
and	1
Sancho	1
(to	1
whom	1
he	1
presented	1
the	1
ten	1
crowns	1
he	1
had	1
promised	1
but	1
had	1
not	1
until	1
then	1
given),	1
left	1
them	1
with	1
many	1
expressions	1
of	1
good-will	1
on	1
both	1
sides.	1
Roque	1
went	1
back,	1
while	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
remained	1
on	1
horseback,	1
just	1
as	1
he	1
was,	1
waiting	1
for	1
day,	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
long	1
before	1
the	1
countenance	1
of	1
the	1
fair	1
Aurora	1
began	1
to	1
show	1
itself	1
at	1
the	1
balconies	1
of	1
the	1
east,	1
gladdening	1
the	1
grass	1

flowers,	1
if	1
not	1
the	1
ear,	1
though	1
to	1
gladden	1
that	1

there	1
came	1
at	1
the	1

moment	1
a	1
sound	1
of	1
clarions	1

drums,	1
and	1
a	1
din	1
of	1
bells,	1
and	1
a	1
tramp,	1
tramp,	1
and	1
cries	1
of	1
“Clear	1
the	1
way	1
there!”	1
of	1
some	1
runners,	1
that	1
seemed	1
to	1
issue	1
from	1
the	1
city.	1

The	1
dawn	1
made	1
way	1
for	1
the	1
sun	1
that	1
with	1
a	1
face	1
broader	1
than	1
a	1
buckler	1
began	1
to	1
rise	1
slowly	1
above	1
the	1
low	1
line	1
of	1
the	1
horizon;	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
and	1
Sancho	1
gazed	1
all	1
round	1
them;	1
they	1
beheld	1
the	1
sea,	1
a	1
sight	1
until	1
then	1
unseen	1
by	1
them;	1
it	1
struck	1
them	1
as	1
exceedingly	1
spacious	1
and	1
broad,	1
much	1
more	1
so	1
than	1
the	1
lakes	1
of	1
Ruidera	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
seen	1
in	1
La	1
Mancha.	1
They	1
saw	1
the	1
galleys	1
along	1
the	1
beach,	1
which,	1
lowering	1
their	1
awnings,	1
displayed	1
themselves	1
decked	1
with	1
streamers	1
and	1
pennons	1
that	1
trembled	1
in	1
the	1
breeze	1
and	1
kissed	1
and	1
swept	1
the	1
water,	1
while	1
on	1
board	1
the	1
bugles,	1
trumpets,	1
and	1
clarions	1
were	1
sounding	1
and	1
filling	1
the	1
air	1
far	1
and	1
near	1
with	1
melodious	1
warlike	1
notes.	1
Then	1
they	1
began	1
to	1
move	1
and	1
execute	1
a	1
kind	1
of	1
skirmish	1
upon	1
the	1
calm	1
water,	1
while	1
a	1
vast	1
number	1
of	1
horsemen	1
on	1
fine	1
horses	1
and	1
in	1
showy	1
liveries,	1
issuing	1
from	1
the	1
city,	1
engaged	1
on	1
their	1
side	1
in	1
a	1
somewhat	1
similar	1
movement.	1
The	1
soldiers	1
on	1
board	1
the	1
galleys	1
kept	1
up	1
a	1
ceaseless	1
fire,	1
which	1
they	1
on	1
the	1
walls	1
and	1
forts	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
returned,	1
and	1
the	1
heavy	1
cannon	1
rent	1
the	1
air	1
with	1
the	1
tremendous	1
noise	1
they	1
made,	1
to	1
which	1
the	1
gangway	1
guns	1
of	1
the	1
galleys	1
replied.	1
The	1
bright	1
sea,	1
the	1
smiling	1
earth,	1
the	1
clear	1
air—though	1
at	1
times	1
darkened	1
by	1
the	1
smoke	1
of	1
the	1
guns—all	1
seemed	1
to	1
fill	1
the	1
whole	1
multitude	1
with	1
unexpected	1
delight.	1
Sancho	1
could	1
not	1
make	1
out	1
how	1
it	1
was	1
that	1
those	1
great	1
masses	1
that	1
moved	1
over	1
the	1
sea	1
had	1
so	1
many	1
feet.	1
And	1
now	1
the	1
horsemen	1
in	1
livery	1
came	1
galloping	1
up	1
with	1
shouts	1
and	1
outlandish	1
cries	1
and	1
cheers	1
to	1
where	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
stood	1
amazed	1
and	1
wondering;	1
and	1
one	1
of	1
them,	1
he	1
to	1
whom	1
Roque	1
had	1
sent	1
word,	1
addressing	1
him	1
exclaimed,	1
“Welcome	1
to	1
our	1
city,	1
mirror,	1
beacon,	1
star	1
and	1
cynosure	1
of	1
all	1
knight-errantry	1
in	1
its	1
widest	1
extent!	1
Welcome,	1
I	1
say,	1
valiant	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
of	1
La	1
Mancha;	1
not	1
the	1
false,	1
the	1
fictitious,	1
the	1
apocryphal,	1
that	1
these	1
latter	1
days	1
have	1
offered	1
us	1
in	1
lying	1
histories,	1
but	1
the	1
true,	1
the	1
legitimate,	1
the	1
real	1
one	1
that	1
Cide	1
Hamete	1
Benengeli,	1
flower	1
of	1
historians,	1
has	1
described	1
to	1
us!”	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
made	1
no	1
answer,	1
nor	1
did	1
the	1
horsemen	1
wait	1
for	1
one,	1
but	1
wheeling	1
again	1
with	1
all	1
their	1
followers,	1
they	1
began	1
curvetting	1
round	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
who,	1
turning	1
to	1
Sancho,	1
said,	1
“These	1
gentlemen	1
have	1
plainly	1
recognised	1
us;	1
I	1
will	1
wager	1
they	1
have	1
read	1
our	1
history,	1
and	1
even	1
that	1
newly	1
printed	1
one	1
by	1
the	1
Aragonese.”	1
The	1
cavalier	1
who	1
had	1
addressed	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
again	1
approached	1
him	1
and	1
said,	1
“Come	1
with	1
us,	1
Señor	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
for	1
we	1
are	1
all	1
of	1
us	1
your	1
servants	1
and	1
great	1
friends	1
of	1
Roque	1
Guinart’s;”	1
to	1
which	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
returned,	1
“If	1
courtesy	1
breeds	1
courtesy,	1
yours,	1
sir	1
knight,	1
is	1
daughter	1
or	1
very	1
nearly	1
akin	1
to	1
the	1
great	1
Roque’s;	1
carry	1
me	1
where	1
you	1
please;	1
I	1
will	1
have	1
no	1
will	1
but	1
yours,	1
especially	1
if	1

to	1

it	1
in	1
your	1

The	1
cavalier	1
replied	1
with	1
words	1
no	1
less	1
polite,	1
and	1
then,	1
all	1
closing	1
in	1
around	1
him,	1
they	1
set	1
out	1
with	1
him	1
for	1
the	1
city,	1
to	1
the	1
music	1
of	1
the	1
clarions	1
and	1
the	1
drums.	1
As	1
they	1
were	1
entering	1
it,	1
the	1
wicked	1
one,	1
who	1
is	1
the	1
author	1
of	1
all	1
mischief,	1
and	1
the	1
boys	1
who	1
are	1
wickeder	1
than	1
the	1
wicked	1
one,	1
contrived	1
that	1
a	1
couple	1
of	1
these	1
audacious	1
irrepressible	1
urchins	1
should	1
force	1
their	1
way	1
through	1
the	1

and	1
lifting	1
up,	1

tail	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
Rocinante’s,	1
insert	1
a	1
bunch	1
of	1
furze	1
under	1
each.	1
The	1
poor	1
beasts	1
felt	1
the	1
strange	1
spurs	1
and	1
added	1
to	1
their	1
anguish	1
by	1
pressing	1
their	1
tails	1
tight,	1
so	1
much	1
so	1
that,	1
cutting	1
a	1
multitude	1
of	1
capers,	1
they	1
flung	1
their	1
masters	1
to	1
the	1
ground.	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
covered	1
with	1
shame	1
and	1
out	1
of	1
countenance,	1
ran	1
to	1
pluck	1
the	1
plume	1
from	1
his	1
poor	1
jade’s	1
tail,	1
while	1
Sancho	1
did	1
the	1
same	1
for	1
Dapple.	1
His	1
conductors	1
tried	1
to	1
punish	1
the	1
audacity	1
of	1
the	1
boys,	1
but	1
there	1
was	1
no	1

having	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
in	1
his	1
house	1
he	1
set	1
about	1
devising	1
modes	1
of	1
making	1
him	1
exhibit	1
his	1
mad	1
points	1
in	1
some	1
harmless	1
fashion;	1
for	1
jests	1
that	1
give	1
pain	1
are	1
no	1
jests,	1
and	1
no	1
sport	1
is	1
worth	1
anything	1
if	1
it	1
hurts	1
another.	1
The	1
first	1
thing	1
he	1
did	1
was	1
to	1
make	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
take	1
off	1
his	1
armour,	1
and	1
lead	1
him,	1
in	1
that	1
tight	1
chamois	1
suit	1
we	1
have	1
already	1
described	1
and	1
depicted	1
more	1
than	1
once,	1
out	1
on	1
a	1
balcony	1
overhanging	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
chief	1
streets	1
of	1
the	1
city,	1
in	1
full	1
view	1
of	1
the	1
crowd	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
boys,	1
who	1
gazed	1
at	1
him	1
as	1
they	1
would	1
at	1
a	1
monkey.	1
The	1
cavaliers	1
in	1
livery	1
careered	1
before	1
him	1
again	1
as	1
though	1
it	1
were	1
for	1
him	1
alone,	1
and	1
not	1
to	1
enliven	1
the	1
festival	1
of	1
the	1
day,	1
that	1
they	1
wore	1
it,	1
and	1
Sancho	1
was	1
in	1
high	1
delight,	1
for	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
that,	1
how	1
he	1
knew	1
not,	1
he	1
had	1
fallen	1
upon	1
another	1
Camacho’s	1
wedding,	1
another	1
house	1
like	1
Don	1
Diego	1
de	1
Miranda’s,	1
another	1
castle	1
like	1
the	1
duke’s.	1
Some	1
of	1
Don	1
Antonio’s	1
friends	1
dined	1
with	1
him	1
that	1
day,	1
and	1
all	1
showed	1
honour	1
to	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
and	1
treated	1
him	1
as	1
a	1
knight-errant,	1
and	1
he	1
becoming	1
puffed	1
up	1
and	1
exalted	1
in	1
consequence	1
could	1
not	1
contain	1
himself	1
for	1
satisfaction.	1
Such	1
were	1
the	1
drolleries	1
of	1
Sancho	1
that	1
all	1
the	1
servants	1
of	1
the	1
house,	1
and	1
all	1
who	1
heard	1
him,	1
were	1
kept	1
hanging	1
upon	1
his	1
lips.	1
While	1
at	1
table	1
Don	1
Antonio	1
said	1
to	1
him,	1
“We	1
hear,	1
worthy	1
Sancho,	1
that	1
you	1
are	1
so	1
fond	1
of	1
manjar	1
blanco	1
and	1
forced-meat	1
balls,	1
that	1
if	1
you	1
have	1
any	1
left,	1
you	1
keep	1
them	1
in	1
your	1
bosom	1
for	1
the	1
next	1
day.”	1
“No,	1
señor,	1
that’s	1
not	1
true,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“for	1
I	1
am	1
more	1
cleanly	1
than	1
greedy,	1
and	1
my	1
master	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
here	1
knows	1
well	1
that	1
we	1
two	1
are	1
used	1
to	1
live	1
for	1
a	1
week	1
on	1
a	1
handful	1
of	1
acorns	1
or	1
nuts.	1
To	1
be	1
sure,	1
if	1
it	1
so	1
happens	1
that	1
they	1
offer	1
me	1
a	1
heifer,	1
I	1
run	1
with	1
a	1
halter;	1
I	1
mean,	1
I	1
eat	1
what	1
I’m	1
given,	1
and	1
make	1
use	1
of	1
opportunities	1
as	1
I	1
find	1
them;	1
but	1
whoever	1
says	1
that	1
I’m	1
an	1
out-of-the-way	1
eater	1
or	1
not	1
cleanly,	1
let	1
me	1
tell	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
wrong;	1
and	1
I’d	1
put	1
it	1
in	1
a	1
different	1
way	1
if	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
respect	1
the	1
honourable	1
beards	1
that	1
are	1
at	1
the	1
table.”	1
“Indeed,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“Sancho’s	1
moderation	1
and	1
cleanliness	1
in	1
eating	1
might	1
be	1
inscribed	1
and	1
graved	1
on	1
plates	1
of	1
brass,	1
to	1
be	1
kept	1
in	1
eternal	1
remembrance	1
in	1
ages	1
to	1
come.	1
It	1
is	1
true	1
that	1
when	1
he	1
is	1
hungry	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
certain	1
appearance	1
of	1
voracity	1
about	1
him,	1
for	1
he	1
eats	1
at	1
a	1
great	1
pace	1
and	1
chews	1
with	1
both	1
jaws;	1
but	1
cleanliness	1
he	1
is	1
always	1
mindful	1
of;	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
governor	1
he	1
learned	1
how	1
to	1
eat	1
daintily,	1
so	1
much	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
eats	1
grapes,	1
and	1
even	1
pomegranate	1
pips,	1
with	1
a	1
fork.”	1
“What!”	1
said	1
Don	1
Antonio,	1
“has	1
Sancho	1
been	1
a	1
governor?”	1
“Ay,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“and	1
of	1
an	1
island	1
called	1
Barataria.	1
I	1
governed	1
it	1
to	1
perfection	1
for	1
ten	1
days;	1
and	1
lost	1
my	1
rest	1
all	1
the	1
time;	1
and	1
learned	1
to	1
look	1
down	1
upon	1
all	1
the	1
governments	1
in	1
the	1
world;	1
I	1
got	1
out	1
of	1
it	1
by	1
taking	1
to	1
flight,	1
and	1
fell	1
into	1
a	1
pit	1
where	1
I	1
gave	1
myself	1
up	1
for	1
dead,	1
and	1
out	1
of	1
which	1
I	1
escaped	1
alive	1
by	1
a	1
miracle.”	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
then	1
gave	1
them	1
a	1
minute	1
account	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
affair	1
of	1
Sancho’s	1
government,	1
with	1
which	1
he	1
greatly	1
amused	1
his	1
hearers.	1
On	1
the	1
cloth	1
being	1
removed	1
Don	1
Antonio,	1
taking	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
by	1
the	1
hand,	1
passed	1
with	1
him	1
into	1
a	1
distant	1
room	1
in	1
which	1
there	1
was	1
nothing	1
in	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
furniture	1
except	1
a	1
table,	1
apparently	1
of	1
jasper,	1
resting	1
on	1
a	1
pedestal	1
of	1
the	1
same,	1
upon	1
which	1
was	1
set	1
up,	1
after	1
the	1
fashion	1
of	1
the	1
busts	1
of	1
the	1
Roman	1
emperors,	1
a	1
head	1
which	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
of	1
bronze.	1
Don	1
Antonio	1
traversed	1
the	1
whole	1
apartment	1
with	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
and	1
walked	1
round	1
the	1
table	1
several	1
times,	1
and	1
then	1
said,	1
“Now,	1
Señor	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
satisfied	1
that	1
no	1
one	1
is	1
listening	1
to	1
us,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
door	1
is	1
shut,	1
I	1
will	1
tell	1
you	1
of	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
rarest	1
adventures,	1
or	1
more	1
properly	1
speaking	1
strange	1
things,	1
that	1
can	1
be	1
imagined,	1
on	1
condition	1
that	1
you	1
will	1
keep	1
what	1
I	1
say	1
to	1
you	1
in	1
the	1
remotest	1
recesses	1
of	1
secrecy.”	1
“I	1
swear	1
it,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“and	1
for	1
greater	1
security	1
I	1
will	1
put	1
a	1
flag-stone	1
over	1
it;	1
for	1
I	1
would	1
have	1
you	1
know,	1
Señor	1
Don	1
Antonio”	1
(he	1
had	1
by	1
this	1
time	1
learned	1
his	1
name),	1
“that	1
you	1
are	1
addressing	1
one	1
who,	1
though	1
he	1
has	1
ears	1
to	1
hear,	1
has	1
no	1
tongue	1
to	1
speak;	1
so	1
that	1
you	1
may	1
safely	1
transfer	1
whatever	1
you	1
have	1
in	1
your	1
bosom	1
into	1
mine,	1
and	1
rely	1
upon	1
it	1
that	1
you	1
have	1
consigned	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
depths	1
of	1
silence.”	1
“In	1
reliance	1
upon	1
that	1
promise,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Antonio,	1
“I	1
will	1
astonish	1
you	1
with	1
what	1
you	1
shall	1
see	1
and	1
hear,	1
and	1
relieve	1
myself	1
of	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
vexation	1
it	1
gives	1
me	1
to	1
have	1
no	1
one	1
to	1
whom	1
I	1
can	1
confide	1
my	1
secrets,	1
for	1
they	1
are	1
not	1
of	1
a	1
sort	1
to	1
be	1
entrusted	1
to	1
everybody.”	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
was	1
puzzled,	1
wondering	1
what	1
could	1
be	1
the	1
object	1
of	1
such	1
precautions;	1
whereupon	1
Don	1
Antonio	1
taking	1
his	1
hand	1
passed	1
it	1
over	1
the	1
bronze	1
head	1
and	1
the	1
whole	1
table	1
and	1
the	1
pedestal	1
of	1
jasper	1
on	1
which	1
it	1
stood,	1
and	1
then	1
said,	1
“This	1
head,	1
Señor	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
has	1
been	1
made	1
and	1
fabricated	1
by	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
greatest	1
magicians	1
and	1
wizards	1
the	1
world	1
ever	1
saw,	1
a	1
Pole,	1
I	1
believe,	1
by	1
birth,	1
and	1
a	1
pupil	1
of	1
the	1
famous	1
Escotillo	1
of	1
whom	1
such	1
marvellous	1
stories	1
are	1
told.	1
He	1
was	1
here	1
in	1
my	1
house,	1
and	1
for	1
a	1
consideration	1
of	1
a	1
thousand	1
crowns	1
that	1
I	1
gave	1
him	1
he	1
constructed	1
this	1
head,	1
which	1
has	1
the	1
property	1
and	1
virtue	1
of	1
answering	1
whatever	1
questions	1
are	1
put	1
to	1
its	1
ear.	1
He	1
observed	1
the	1
points	1
of	1
the	1
compass,	1
he	1
traced	1
figures,	1
he	1
studied	1
the	1
stars,	1
he	1
watched	1
favourable	1
moments,	1
and	1
at	1
length	1
brought	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
perfection	1
we	1
shall	1
see	1
to-morrow,	1
for	1
on	1
Fridays	1
it	1
is	1
mute,	1
and	1
this	1
being	1
Friday	1
we	1
must	1
wait	1
till	1
the	1
next	1
day.	1
In	1
the	1
interval	1
your	1
worship	1
may	1
consider	1
what	1
you	1
would	1
like	1
to	1
ask	1
it;	1
and	1
I	1
know	1
by	1
experience	1
that	1
in	1
all	1
its	1
answers	1
it	1
tells	1
the	1
truth.”	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
was	1
amazed	1
at	1
the	1
virtue	1
and	1
property	1
of	1
the	1
head,	1
and	1
was	1
inclined	1
to	1
disbelieve	1
Don	1
Antonio;	1
but	1
seeing	1
what	1
a	1
short	1
time	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
wait	1
to	1
test	1
the	1
matter,	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
choose	1
to	1
say	1
anything	1
except	1
that	1
he	1
thanked	1
him	1
for	1
having	1
revealed	1
to	1
him	1
so	1
mighty	1
a	1
secret.	1
They	1
then	1
quitted	1
the	1
room,	1
Don	1
Antonio	1
locked	1
the	1
door,	1
and	1
they	1
repaired	1
to	1
the	1
chamber	1
where	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
gentlemen	1
were	1
assembled.	1
In	1
the	1
meantime	1
Sancho	1
had	1
recounted	1
to	1
them	1
several	1
of	1
the	1
adventures	1
and	1
accidents	1
that	1
had	1
happened	1
his	1
master.	1
That	1
afternoon	1
they	1
took	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
out	1
for	1
a	1
stroll,	1
not	1
in	1
his	1
armour	1
but	1
in	1
street	1
costume,	1
with	1
a	1
surcoat	1
of	1
tawny	1
cloth	1
upon	1
him,	1
that	1
at	1
that	1
season	1
would	1
have	1
made	1
ice	1
itself	1
sweat.	1
Orders	1
were	1
left	1
with	1
the	1
servants	1
to	1
entertain	1
Sancho	1
so	1
as	1
not	1
to	1
let	1
him	1
leave	1
the	1
house.	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
was	1
mounted,	1
not	1
on	1
Rocinante,	1
but	1
upon	1
a	1
tall	1
mule	1
of	1
easy	1
pace	1
and	1
handsomely	1
caparisoned.	1
They	1
put	1
the	1
surcoat	1
on	1
him,	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
back,	1
without	1
his	1
perceiving	1
it,	1
they	1
stitched	1
a	1
parchment	1
on	1
which	1
they	1
wrote	1
in	1
large	1
letters,	1
“This	1
is	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
of	1
La	1
Mancha.”	1
As	1
they	1
set	1
out	1
upon	1
their	1
excursion	1
the	1
placard	1
attracted	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
all	1
who	1
chanced	1
to	1
see	1
him,	1
and	1
as	1
they	1
read	1
out,	1
“This	1
is	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
of	1
La	1
Mancha,”	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
was	1
amazed	1
to	1
see	1
how	1
many	1
people	1
gazed	1
at	1
him,	1
called	1
him	1
by	1
his	1
name,	1
and	1
recognised	1
him,	1
and	1
turning	1
to	1
Don	1
Antonio,	1
who	1
rode	1
at	1
his	1
side,	1
he	1
observed	1
to	1
him,	1
“Great	1
are	1
the	1
privileges	1
knight-errantry	1
involves,	1
for	1
it	1
makes	1
him	1
who	1
professes	1
it	1
known	1
and	1
famous	1
in	1
every	1
region	1
of	1
the	1
earth;	1
see,	1
Don	1
Antonio,	1
even	1
the	1
very	1
boys	1
of	1
this	1
city	1
know	1
me	1
without	1
ever	1
having	1
seen	1
me.”	1
“True,	1
Señor	1
Don	1
Quixote,”	1
returned	1
Don	1
Antonio;	1
“for	1
as	1
fire	1
cannot	1
be	1
hidden	1
or	1
kept	1
secret,	1
virtue	1
cannot	1
escape	1
being	1
recognised;	1
and	1
that	1
which	1
is	1
attained	1
by	1
the	1
profession	1
of	1
arms	1
shines	1
distinguished	1
above	1
all	1
others.”	1
It	1
came	1
to	1
pass,	1
however,	1
that	1
as	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
was	1
proceeding	1
amid	1
the	1
acclamations	1
that	1
have	1
been	1
described,	1
a	1
Castilian,	1
reading	1
the	1
inscription	1
on	1
his	1
back,	1
cried	1
out	1
in	1
a	1
loud	1
voice,	1
“The	1
devil	1
take	1
thee	1
for	1
a	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
of	1
La	1
Mancha!	1
What!	1
art	1
thou	1
here,	1
and	1
not	1
dead	1
of	1
the	1
countless	1
drubbings	1
that	1
have	1
fallen	1
on	1
thy	1
ribs?	1
Thou	1
art	1
mad;	1
and	1
if	1
thou	1
wert	1
so	1
by	1
thyself,	1
and	1
kept	1
thyself	1
within	1
thy	1
madness,	1
it	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
so	1
bad;	1
but	1
thou	1
hast	1
the	1
gift	1
of	1
making	1
fools	1
and	1
blockheads	1
of	1
all	1
who	1
have	1
anything	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
thee	1
or	1
say	1
to	1
thee.	1
Why,	1
look	1
at	1
these	1
gentlemen	1
bearing	1
thee	1
company!	1
Get	1
thee	1
home,	1
blockhead,	1
and	1
see	1
after	1
thy	1
affairs,	1
and	1
thy	1
wife	1
and	1
children,	1
and	1
give	1
over	1
these	1
fooleries	1
that	1
are	1
sapping	1
thy	1
brains	1
and	1
skimming	1
away	1
thy	1
wits.”	1
“Go	1
your	1
own	1
way,	1
brother,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Antonio,	1
“and	1
don’t	1
offer	1
advice	1
to	1
those	1
who	1
don’t	1
ask	1
you	1
for	1
it.	1
Señor	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
is	1
in	1
his	1
full	1
senses,	1
and	1
we	1
who	1
bear	1
him	1
company	1
are	1
not	1
fools;	1
virtue	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
honoured	1
wherever	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
found;	1
go,	1
and	1
bad	1
luck	1
to	1
you,	1
and	1
don’t	1
meddle	1
where	1
you	1
are	1
not	1
wanted.”	1
“By	1
God,	1
your	1
worship	1
is	1
right,”	1
replied	1
the	1
Castilian;	1
“for	1
to	1
advise	1
this	1
good	1
man	1
is	1
to	1
kick	1
against	1
the	1
pricks;	1
still	1
for	1
all	1
that	1
it	1
fills	1
me	1
with	1
pity	1
that	1
the	1
sound	1
wit	1
they	1
say	1
the	1
blockhead	1
has	1
in	1
everything	1
should	1
dribble	1
away	1
by	1
the	1
channel	1
of	1
his	1
knight-errantry;	1
but	1
may	1
the	1
bad	1
luck	1
your	1
worship	1
talks	1
of	1
follow	1
me	1
and	1
all	1
my	1
descendants,	1
if,	1
from	1
this	1
day	1
forth,	1
though	1
I	1
should	1
live	1
longer	1
than	1
Methuselah,	1
I	1
ever	1
give	1
advice	1
to	1
anybody	1
even	1
if	1
he	1
asks	1
me	1
for	1
it.”	1
The	1
advice-giver	1
took	1
himself	1
off,	1
and	1
they	1
continued	1
their	1
stroll;	1
but	1
so	1
great	1
was	1
the	1
press	1
of	1
the	1
boys	1
and	1
people	1
to	1
read	1
the	1
placard,	1
that	1
Don	1
Antonio	1
was	1
forced	1
to	1
remove	1
it	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
were	1
taking	1
off	1
something	1
else.	1

Night	1
came	1
and	1
they	1
went	1
home,	1
and	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
ladies’	1
dancing	1
party,	1
for	1
Don	1
Antonio’s	1
wife,	1
a	1
lady	1
of	1
rank	1
and	1
gaiety,	1
beauty	1
and	1
wit,	1
had	1
invited	1
some	1
friends	1
of	1
hers	1
to	1
come	1
and	1
do	1
honour	1
to	1
her	1
guest	1
and	1
amuse	1
themselves	1
with	1
his	1
strange	1
delusions.	1
Several	1
of	1
them	1
came,	1
they	1
supped	1
sumptuously,	1
the	1
dance	1
began	1
at	1
about	1
ten	1
o’clock.	1
Among	1
the	1
ladies	1
were	1
two	1
of	1
a	1
mischievous	1
and	1
frolicsome	1
turn,	1
and,	1
though	1
perfectly	1
modest,	1
somewhat	1
free	1
in	1
playing	1
tricks	1
for	1
harmless	1
diversion’s	1
sake.	1
These	1
two	1
were	1
so	1
indefatigable	1
in	1
taking	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
out	1
to	1
dance	1
that	1
they	1
tired	1
him	1
down,	1
not	1
only	1
in	1
body	1
but	1
in	1
spirit.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
sight	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
figure	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
made,	1
long,	1
lank,	1
lean,	1
and	1
yellow,	1
his	1
garments	1
clinging	1
tight	1
to	1
him,	1
ungainly,	1
and	1
above	1
all	1
anything	1
but	1
agile.	1

The	1
gay	1
ladies	1
made	1
secret	1
love	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
on	1
his	1
part	1
secretly	1
repelled	1
them,	1
but	1
finding	1
himself	1
hard	1
pressed	1
by	1
their	1
blandishments	1
he	1
lifted	1
up	1
his	1
voice	1
and	1
exclaimed,	1
“_Fugite,	1
partes	1
adversæ!_	1
Leave	1
me	1
in	1
peace,	1
unwelcome	1
overtures;	1
avaunt,	1
with	1
your	1
desires,	1
ladies,	1
for	1
she	1
who	1
is	1
queen	1
of	1
mine,	1
the	1
peerless	1
Dulcinea	1
del	1
Toboso,	1
suffers	1
none	1
but	1
hers	1
to	1
lead	1
me	1
captive	1
and	1
subdue	1
me;”	1
and	1
so	1
saying	1
he	1
sat	1
down	1
on	1
the	1
floor	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
room,	1
tired	1
out	1
and	1
broken	1
down	1
by	1
all	1
this	1
exertion	1
in	1
the	1
dance.	1
Don	1
Antonio	1
directed	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
taken	1
up	1
bodily	1
and	1
carried	1
to	1
bed,	1
and	1
the	1
first	1
that	1
laid	1
hold	1
of	1
him	1
was	1
Sancho,	1
saying	1
as	1
he	1
did	1
so,	1
“In	1
an	1
evil	1
hour	1
you	1
took	1
to	1
dancing,	1
master	1
mine;	1
do	1
you	1
fancy	1
all	1
mighty	1
men	1
of	1
valour	1
are	1
dancers,	1
and	1
all	1
knights-errant	1
given	1
to	1
capering?	1
If	1
you	1
do,	1
I	1
can	1
tell	1
you	1
you	1
are	1
mistaken;	1
there’s	1
many	1
a	1
man	1
would	1
rather	1
undertake	1
to	1
kill	1
a	1
giant	1
than	1
cut	1
a	1
caper.	1
If	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
the	1
shoe-fling	1
you	1
were	1
at	1
I	1
could	1
take	1
your	1
place,	1
for	1
I	1
can	1
do	1
the	1
shoe-fling	1
like	1
a	1
gerfalcon;	1
but	1
I’m	1
no	1
good	1
at	1
dancing.”	1
With	1
these	1
and	1
other	1
observations	1
Sancho	1
set	1
the	1
whole	1
ball-room	1
laughing,	1
and	1
then	1
put	1
his	1
master	1
to	1
bed,	1
covering	1
him	1
up	1
well	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
sweat	1
out	1
any	1
chill	1
caught	1
after	1
his	1
dancing.	1
The	1
next	1
day	1
Don	1
Antonio	1
thought	1
he	1
might	1
as	1
well	1
make	1
trial	1
of	1
the	1
enchanted	1
head,	1
and	1
with	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
Sancho,	1
and	1
two	1
others,	1
friends	1
of	1
his,	1
besides	1
the	1
two	1
ladies	1
that	1
had	1
tired	1
out	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
at	1
the	1
ball,	1
who	1
had	1
remained	1
for	1
the	1
night	1
with	1
Don	1
Antonio’s	1
wife,	1
he	1
locked	1
himself	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
chamber	1
where	1
the	1
head	1
was.	1
He	1
explained	1
to	1
them	1
the	1
property	1
it	1
possessed	1
and	1
entrusted	1
the	1
secret	1
to	1
them,	1
telling	1
them	1
that	1
now	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time	1
he	1
was	1
going	1
to	1
try	1
the	1
virtue	1
of	1
the	1
enchanted	1
head;	1
but	1
except	1
Don	1
Antonio’s	1
two	1
friends	1
no	1
one	1
else	1
was	1
privy	1
to	1
the	1
mystery	1
of	1
the	1
enchantment,	1
and	1
if	1
Don	1
Antonio	1
had	1
not	1
first	1
revealed	1
it	1
to	1
them	1
they	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
inevitably	1
reduced	1
to	1
the	1
same	1
state	1
of	1
amazement	1
as	1
the	1
rest,	1
so	1
artfully	1
and	1
skilfully	1
was	1
it	1
contrived.	1
The	1
first	1
to	1
approach	1
the	1
ear	1
of	1
the	1
head	1
was	1
Don	1
Antonio	1
himself,	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
low	1
voice	1
but	1
not	1
so	1
low	1
as	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
audible	1
to	1
all,	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
it,	1
“Head,	1
tell	1
me	1
by	1
the	1
virtue	1
that	1
lies	1
in	1
thee	1
what	1
am	1
I	1
at	1
this	1
moment	1
thinking	1
of?”	1
The	1
head,	1
without	1
any	1
movement	1
of	1
the	1
lips,	1
answered	1
in	1
a	1
clear	1
and	1
distinct	1
voice,	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
be	1
heard	1
by	1
all,	1
“I	1
cannot	1
judge	1
of	1
thoughts.”	1
All	1
were	1
thunderstruck	1
at	1
this,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
more	1
so	1
as	1
they	1
saw	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
nobody	1
anywhere	1
near	1
the	1
table	1
or	1
in	1
the	1
whole	1
room	1
that	1
could	1
have	1
answered.	1
“How	1
many	1
of	1
us	1
are	1
here?”	1
asked	1
Don	1
Antonio	1
once	1
more;	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
answered	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
way	1
softly,	1
“Thou	1
and	1
thy	1
wife,	1
with	1
two	1
friends	1
of	1
thine	1
and	1
two	1
of	1
hers,	1
and	1
a	1
famous	1
knight	1
called	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
of	1
La	1
Mancha,	1
and	1
a	1
squire	1
of	1
his,	1
Sancho	1
Panza	1
by	1
name.”	1
Now	1
there	1
was	1
fresh	1
astonishment;	1
now	1
everyone’s	1
hair	1
was	1
standing	1
on	1
end	1
with	1
awe;	1
and	1
Don	1
Antonio	1
retiring	1
from	1
the	1
head	1
exclaimed,	1
“This	1
suffices	1
to	1
show	1
me	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
been	1
deceived	1
by	1
him	1
who	1
sold	1
thee	1
to	1
me,	1
O	1
sage	1
head,	1
talking	1
head,	1
answering	1
head,	1
wonderful	1
head!	1
Let	1
someone	1
else	1
go	1
and	1
put	1
what	1
question	1
he	1
likes	1
to	1
it.”	1
And	1
as	1
women	1
are	1
commonly	1
impulsive	1
and	1
inquisitive,	1
the	1
first	1
to	1
come	1
forward	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
two	1
friends	1
of	1
Don	1
Antonio’s	1
wife,	1
and	1
her	1
question	1
was,	1
“Tell	1
me,	1
Head,	1
what	1
shall	1
I	1
do	1
to	1
be	1
very	1
beautiful?”	1
and	1
the	1
answer	1
she	1
got	1
was,	1
“Be	1
very	1
modest.”	1
“I	1
question	1
thee	1
no	1
further,”	1
said	1
the	1
fair	1
querist.	1
Her	1
companion	1
then	1
came	1
up	1
and	1
said,	1
“I	1
should	1
like	1
to	1
know,	1
Head,	1
whether	1
my	1
husband	1
loves	1
me	1
or	1
not;”	1
the	1
answer	1
given	1
to	1
her	1
was,	1
“Think	1
how	1
he	1
uses	1
thee,	1
and	1
thou	1
mayest	1
guess;”	1
and	1
the	1
married	1
lady	1
went	1
off	1
saying,	1
“That	1
answer	1
did	1
not	1
need	1
a	1
question;	1
for	1
of	1
course	1
the	1
treatment	1
one	1
receives	1
shows	1
the	1
disposition	1
of	1
him	1
from	1
whom	1
it	1
is	1
received.”	1
Then	1
one	1
of	1
Don	1
Antonio’s	1
two	1
friends	1
advanced	1
and	1
asked	1
it,	1
“Who	1
am	1
I?”	1
“Thou	1
knowest,”	1
was	1
the	1
answer.	1
“That	1
is	1
not	1
what	1
I	1
ask	1
thee,”	1
said	1
the	1
gentleman,	1
“but	1
to	1
tell	1
me	1
if	1
thou	1
knowest	1
me.”	1
“Yes,	1
I	1
know	1
thee,	1
thou	1
art	1
Don	1
Pedro	1
Noriz,”	1
was	1
the	1
reply.	1
“I	1
do	1
not	1
seek	1
to	1
know	1
more,”	1
said	1
the	1
gentleman,	1
“for	1
this	1
is	1
enough	1
to	1
convince	1
me,	1
O	1
Head,	1
that	1
thou	1
knowest	1
everything;”	1
and	1
as	1
he	1
retired	1
the	1
other	1
friend	1
came	1
forward	1
and	1
asked	1
it,	1
“Tell	1
me,	1
Head,	1
what	1
are	1
the	1
wishes	1
of	1
my	1
eldest	1
son?”	1
“I	1
have	1
said	1
already,”	1
was	1
the	1
answer,	1
“that	1
I	1
cannot	1
judge	1
of	1
wishes;	1
however,	1
I	1
can	1
tell	1
thee	1
the	1
wish	1
of	1
thy	1
son	1
is	1
to	1
bury	1
thee.”	1
“That’s	1
‘what	1
I	1
see	1
with	1
my	1
eyes	1
I	1
point	1
out	1
with	1
my	1
finger,’”	1
said	1
the	1
gentleman,	1
“so	1
I	1
ask	1
no	1
more.”	1
Don	1
Antonio’s	1
wife	1
came	1
up	1
and	1
said,	1
“I	1
know	1
not	1
what	1
to	1
ask	1
thee,	1
Head;	1
I	1
would	1
only	1
seek	1
to	1
know	1
of	1
thee	1
if	1
I	1
shall	1
have	1
many	1
years	1
of	1
enjoyment	1
of	1
my	1
good	1
husband;”	1
and	1
the	1
answer	1
she	1
received	1
was,	1
“Thou	1
shalt,	1
for	1
his	1
vigour	1
and	1
his	1
temperate	1
habits	1
promise	1
many	1
years	1
of	1
life,	1
which	1
by	1
their	1
intemperance	1
others	1
so	1
often	1
cut	1
short.”	1
Then	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
came	1
forward	1
and	1
said,	1
“Tell	1
me,	1
thou	1
that	1
answerest,	1
was	1
that	1
which	1
I	1
describe	1
as	1
having	1
happened	1
to	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
cave	1
of	1
Montesinos	1
the	1
truth	1
or	1
a	1
dream?	1
Will	1
Sancho’s	1
whipping	1
be	1
accomplished	1
without	1
fail?	1
Will	1
the	1
disenchantment	1
of	1
Dulcinea	1
be	1
brought	1
about?”	1

“As	1
to	1
the	1
question	1
of	1
the	1
cave,”	1
was	1
the	1
reply,	1
“there	1
is	1
much	1
to	1
be	1
said;	1
there	1
is	1
something	1
of	1
both	1
in	1
it.	1
Sancho’s	1
whipping	1
will	1
proceed	1
leisurely.	1
The	1
disenchantment	1
of	1
Dulcinea	1
will	1
attain	1
its	1
due	1
consummation.”	1
“I	1
seek	1
to	1
know	1
no	1
more,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
“let	1
me	1
but	1
see	1
Dulcinea	1
disenchanted,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
consider	1
that	1
all	1
the	1
good	1
fortune	1
I	1
could	1
wish	1
for	1
has	1
come	1
upon	1
me	1
all	1
at	1
once.”	1
The	1
last	1
questioner	1
was	1
Sancho,	1
and	1
his	1
questions	1
were,	1
“Head,	1
shall	1
I	1
by	1
any	1
chance	1
have	1
another	1
government?	1
Shall	1
I	1
ever	1
escape	1
from	1
the	1
hard	1
life	1
of	1
a	1
squire?	1
Shall	1
I	1
get	1
back	1
to	1
see	1
my	1
wife	1
and	1
children?”	1
To	1
which	1
the	1
answer	1
came,	1
“Thou	1
shalt	1
govern	1
in	1
thy	1
house;	1
and	1
if	1
thou	1
returnest	1
to	1
it	1
thou	1
shalt	1
see	1
thy	1
wife	1
and	1
children;	1
and	1
on	1
ceasing	1
to	1
serve	1
thou	1
shalt	1
cease	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
squire.”	1
“Good,	1
by	1
God!”	1
said	1
Sancho	1
Panza;	1
“I	1
could	1
have	1
told	1
myself	1
that;	1
the	1
prophet	1
Perogrullo	1
could	1
have	1
said	1
no	1
more.”	1
“What	1
answer	1
wouldst	1
thou	1
have,	1
beast?”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
“is	1
it	1
not	1
enough	1
that	1
the	1
replies	1
this	1
head	1
has	1
given	1
suit	1
the	1
questions	1
put	1
to	1
it?”	1
“Yes,	1
it	1
is	1
enough,”	1
said	1
Sancho;	1
“but	1
I	1
should	1
have	1
liked	1
it	1
to	1
have	1
made	1
itself	1
plainer	1
and	1
told	1
me	1
more.”	1
The	1
questions	1
and	1
answers	1
came	1
to	1
an	1
end	1
here,	1
but	1
not	1
the	1
wonder	1
with	1
which	1
all	1
were	1
filled,	1
except	1
Don	1
Antonio’s	1
two	1
friends	1
who	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
secret.	1
This	1
Cide	1
Hamete	1
Benengeli	1
thought	1
fit	1
to	1
reveal	1
at	1
once,	1
not	1
to	1
keep	1
the	1
world	1
in	1
suspense,	1
fancying	1
that	1
the	1
head	1
had	1
some	1
strange	1
magical	1
mystery	1
in	1
it.	1
He	1
says,	1
therefore,	1
that	1
on	1
the	1
model	1
of	1
another	1
head,	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
an	1
image	1
maker,	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
seen	1
at	1
Madrid,	1
Don	1
Antonio	1
made	1
this	1
one	1
at	1
home	1
for	1
his	1
own	1
amusement	1
and	1
to	1
astonish	1
ignorant	1
people;	1
and	1
its	1
mechanism	1
was	1
as	1
follows.	1
The	1
table	1
was	1
of	1
wood	1
painted	1
and	1
varnished	1
to	1
imitate	1
jasper,	1
and	1
the	1
pedestal	1
on	1
which	1
it	1
stood	1
was	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
material,	1
with	1
four	1
eagles’	1
claws	1
projecting	1
from	1
it	1
to	1
support	1
the	1
weight	1
more	1
steadily.	1
The	1
head,	1
which	1
resembled	1
a	1
bust	1
or	1
figure	1
of	1
a	1
Roman	1
emperor,	1
and	1
was	1
coloured	1
like	1
bronze,	1
was	1
hollow	1
throughout,	1
as	1
was	1
the	1
table,	1
into	1
which	1
it	1
was	1
fitted	1
so	1
exactly	1
that	1
no	1
trace	1
of	1
the	1
joining	1
was	1
visible.	1
The	1
pedestal	1
of	1
the	1
table	1
was	1
also	1
hollow	1
and	1
communicated	1
with	1
the	1
throat	1
and	1
neck	1
of	1
the	1
head,	1
and	1
the	1
whole	1
was	1
in	1
communication	1
with	1
another	1
room	1
underneath	1
the	1
chamber	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
head	1
stood.	1
Through	1
the	1
entire	1
cavity	1
in	1
the	1
pedestal,	1
table,	1
throat	1
and	1
neck	1
of	1
the	1
bust	1
or	1
figure,	1
there	1
passed	1
a	1
tube	1
of	1
tin	1
carefully	1
adjusted	1
and	1
concealed	1
from	1
sight.	1
In	1
the	1
room	1
below	1
corresponding	1
to	1
the	1
one	1
above	1
was	1
placed	1
the	1
person	1
who	1
was	1
to	1
answer,	1
with	1
his	1
mouth	1
to	1
the	1
tube,	1
and	1
the	1
voice,	1
as	1
in	1
an	1
ear-trumpet,	1
passed	1
from	1
above	1
downwards,	1
and	1
from	1
below	1
upwards,	1
the	1
words	1
coming	1
clearly	1
and	1
distinctly;	1
it	1
was	1
impossible,	1
thus,	1
to	1
detect	1
the	1
trick.	1
A	1
nephew	1
of	1
Don	1
Antonio’s,	1
a	1
smart	1
sharp-witted	1
student,	1
was	1
the	1
answerer,	1
and	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
told	1
beforehand	1
by	1
his	1
uncle	1
who	1
the	1
persons	1
were	1
that	1
would	1
come	1
with	1
him	1
that	1
day	1
into	1
the	1
chamber	1
where	1
the	1
head	1
was,	1
it	1
was	1
an	1
easy	1
matter	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
answer	1
the	1
first	1
question	1
at	1
once	1
and	1
correctly;	1
the	1
others	1
he	1
answered	1
by	1
guess-work,	1
and,	1
being	1
clever,	1
cleverly.	1
Cide	1
Hamete	1
adds	1
that	1
this	1
marvellous	1
contrivance	1
stood	1
for	1
some	1
ten	1
or	1
twelve	1
days;	1
but	1
that,	1
as	1
it	1
became	1
noised	1
abroad	1
through	1
the	1
city	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
in	1
his	1
house	1
an	1
enchanted	1
head	1
that	1
answered	1
all	1
who	1
asked	1
questions	1
of	1
it,	1
Don	1
Antonio,	1
fearing	1
it	1
might	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
ears	1
of	1
the	1
watchful	1
sentinels	1
of	1
our	1
faith,	1
explained	1
the	1
matter	1
to	1
the	1
inquisitors,	1
who	1
commanded	1
him	1
to	1
break	1
it	1
up	1
and	1
have	1
done	1
with	1
it,	1
lest	1
the	1
ignorant	1
vulgar	1
should	1
be	1
scandalised.	1
By	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
however,	1
and	1
by	1
Sancho	1
the	1
head	1
was	1
still	1
held	1
to	1
be	1
an	1
enchanted	1
one,	1
and	1
capable	1
of	1
answering	1
questions,	1
though	1
more	1
to	1
Don	1
Quixote’s	1
satisfaction	1
than	1
Sancho’s.	1
The	1
gentlemen	1
of	1
the	1
city,	1
to	1
gratify	1
Don	1
Antonio	1
and	1
also	1
to	1
do	1
the	1
honours	1
to	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
and	1
give	1
him	1
an	1
opportunity	1
of	1
displaying	1
his	1
folly,	1
made	1
arrangements	1
for	1
a	1
tilting	1
at	1
the	1
ring	1
in	1
six	1
days	1
from	1
that	1
time,	1
which,	1
however,	1
for	1
reason	1
that	1
will	1
be	1
mentioned	1
hereafter,	1
did	1
not	1
take	1
place.	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
took	1
a	1
fancy	1
to	1
stroll	1
about	1
the	1
city	1
quietly	1
and	1
on	1
foot,	1
for	1
he	1
feared	1
that	1
if	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
horseback	1
the	1
boys	1
would	1
follow	1
him;	1
so	1
he	1
and	1
Sancho	1
and	1
two	1
servants	1
that	1
Don	1
Antonio	1
gave	1
him	1
set	1
out	1
for	1
a	1
walk.	1
Thus	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
pass	1
that	1
going	1
along	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
streets	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
lifted	1
up	1
his	1
eyes	1
and	1
saw	1
written	1
in	1
very	1
large	1
letters	1
over	1
a	1
door,	1
“Books	1
printed	1
here,”	1
at	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
vastly	1
pleased,	1
for	1
until	1
then	1
he	1
had	1
never	1
seen	1
a	1
printing	1
office,	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
curious	1
to	1
know	1
what	1
it	1
was	1
like.	1
He	1
entered	1
with	1
all	1
his	1
following,	1
and	1
saw	1
them	1
drawing	1
sheets	1
in	1
one	1
place,	1
correcting	1
in	1
another,	1
setting	1
up	1
type	1
here,	1
revising	1
there;	1
in	1
short	1
all	1
the	1
work	1
that	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
seen	1
in	1
great	1
printing	1
offices.	1
He	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
one	1
case	1
and	1
asked	1
what	1
they	1
were	1
about	1
there;	1
the	1
workmen	1
told	1
him,	1
he	1
watched	1
them	1
with	1
wonder,	1
and	1
passed	1
on.	1
He	1
approached	1
one	1
man,	1
among	1
others,	1
and	1
asked	1
him	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
doing.	1
The	1
workman	1
replied,	1
“Señor,	1
this	1
gentleman	1
here”	1
(pointing	1
to	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
prepossessing	1
appearance	1
and	1
a	1
certain	1
gravity	1
of	1
look)	1
“has	1
translated	1
an	1
Italian	1
book	1
into	1
our	1
Spanish	1
tongue,	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
setting	1
it	1
up	1
in	1
type	1
for	1
the	1
press.”	1
“What	1
is	1
the	1
title	1
of	1
the	1
book?”	1
asked	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
to	1
which	1
the	1
author	1
replied,	1
“Señor,	1
in	1
Italian	1
the	1
book	1
is	1
called	1
_Le	1
Bagatelle_.”	1
“And	1
what	1
does	1
_Le	1
Bagatelle_	1
import	1
in	1
our	1
Spanish?”	1
asked	1
Don	1
Quixote.	1
“_Le	1
Bagatelle_,”	1
said	1
the	1
author,	1
“is	1
as	1
though	1
we	1
should	1
say	1
in	1
Spanish	1
_Los	1
Juguetes;_	1
but	1
though	1
the	1
book	1
is	1
humble	1
in	1
name	1
it	1
has	1
good	1
solid	1
matter	1
in	1
it.”	1
“I,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“have	1
some	1
little	1
smattering	1
of	1
Italian,	1
and	1
I	1
plume	1
myself	1
on	1
singing	1
some	1
of	1
Ariosto’s	1
stanzas;	1
but	1
tell	1
me,	1
señor—I	1
do	1
not	1
say	1
this	1
to	1
test	1
your	1
ability,	1
but	1
merely	1
out	1
of	1
curiosity—have	1
you	1
ever	1
met	1
with	1
the	1
word	1
_pignatta_	1
in	1
your	1
book?”	1
“Yes,	1
often,”	1
said	1
the	1
author.	1
“And	1
how	1
do	1
you	1
render	1
that	1
in	1
Spanish?”	1
“How	1
should	1
I	1
render	1
it,”	1
returned	1
the	1
author,	1
“but	1
by	1
_olla_?”	1
“Body	1
o’	1
me,”	1
exclaimed	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“what	1
a	1
proficient	1
you	1
are	1
in	1
the	1
Italian	1
language!	1
I	1
would	1
lay	1
a	1
good	1
wager	1
that	1
where	1
they	1
say	1
in	1
Italian	1
_piace_	1
you	1
say	1
in	1
Spanish	1
_place_,	1
and	1
where	1
they	1
say	1
_piu_	1
you	1
say	1
_mas_,	1
and	1
you	1
translate	1
_sù_	1
by	1
_arriba_	1
and	1
_giù_	1
by	1
_abajo_.”	1
“I	1
translate	1
them	1
so	1
of	1
course,”	1
said	1
the	1
author,	1
“for	1
those	1
are	1
their	1
proper	1
equivalents.”	1
“I	1
would	1
venture	1
to	1
swear,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“that	1
your	1
worship	1
is	1
not	1
known	1
in	1
the	1
world,	1
which	1
always	1
begrudges	1
their	1
reward	1
to	1
rare	1
wits	1
and	1
praiseworthy	1
labours.	1
What	1
talents	1
lie	1
wasted	1
there!	1
What	1
genius	1
thrust	1
away	1
into	1
corners!	1
What	1
worth	1
left	1
neglected!	1
Still	1
it	1
seems	1
to	1
me	1
that	1
translation	1
from	1
one	1
language	1
into	1
another,	1
if	1
it	1
be	1
not	1
from	1
the	1
queens	1
of	1
languages,	1
the	1
Greek	1
and	1
the	1
Latin,	1
is	1
like	1
looking	1
at	1
Flemish	1
tapestries	1
on	1
the	1
wrong	1
side;	1
for	1
though	1
the	1
figures	1
are	1
visible,	1
they	1
are	1
full	1
of	1
threads	1
that	1
make	1
them	1
indistinct,	1
and	1
they	1
do	1
not	1
show	1
with	1
the	1
smoothness	1
and	1
brightness	1
of	1
the	1
right	1
side;	1
and	1
translation	1
from	1
easy	1
languages	1
argues	1
neither	1
ingenuity	1
nor	1
command	1
of	1
words,	1
any	1
more	1
than	1
transcribing	1
or	1
copying	1
out	1
one	1
document	1
from	1
another.	1
But	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
mean	1
by	1
this	1
to	1
draw	1
the	1
inference	1
that	1
no	1
credit	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
allowed	1
for	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
translating,	1
for	1
a	1
man	1
may	1
employ	1
himself	1
in	1
ways	1
worse	1
and	1
less	1
profitable	1
to	1
himself.	1
This	1
estimate	1
does	1
not	1
include	1
two	1
famous	1
translators,	1
Doctor	1
Cristóbal	1
de	1
Figueroa,	1
in	1
his	1
_Pastor	1
Fido_,	1
and	1
Don	1
Juan	1
de	1
Jáuregui,	1
in	1
his	1
_Aminta_,	1
wherein	1
by	1
their	1
felicity	1
they	1
leave	1
it	1
in	1
doubt	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
translation	1
and	1
which	1
the	1
original.	1
But	1
tell	1
me,	1
are	1
you	1
printing	1
this	1
book	1
at	1
your	1
own	1
risk,	1
or	1
have	1
you	1
sold	1
the	1
copyright	1
to	1
some	1
bookseller?”	1
“I	1
print	1
at	1
my	1
own	1
risk,”	1
said	1
the	1
author,	1
“and	1
I	1
expect	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
thousand	1
ducats	1
at	1
least	1
by	1
this	1
first	1
edition,	1
which	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
of	1
two	1
thousand	1
copies	1
that	1
will	1
go	1
off	1
in	1
a	1
twinkling	1
at	1
six	1
reals	1
apiece.”	1
“A	1
fine	1
calculation	1
you	1
are	1
making!”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
“it	1
is	1
plain	1
you	1
don’t	1
know	1
the	1
ins	1
and	1
outs	1
of	1
the	1
printers,	1
and	1
how	1
they	1
play	1
into	1
one	1
another’s	1
hands.	1
I	1
promise	1
you	1
when	1
you	1
find	1
yourself	1
saddled	1
with	1
two	1
thousand	1
copies	1
you	1
will	1
feel	1
so	1
sore	1
that	1
it	1
will	1
astonish	1
you,	1
particularly	1
if	1
the	1
book	1
is	1
a	1
little	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
common	1
and	1
not	1
in	1
any	1
way	1
highly	1
spiced.”	1
“What!”	1
said	1
the	1
author,	1
“would	1
your	1
worship,	1
then,	1
have	1
me	1
give	1
it	1
to	1
a	1
bookseller	1
who	1
will	1
give	1
three	1
maravedis	1
for	1
the	1
copyright	1
and	1
think	1
he	1
is	1
doing	1
me	1
a	1
favour?	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
print	1
my	1
books	1
to	1
win	1
fame	1
in	1
the	1
world,	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
known	1
in	1
it	1
already	1
by	1
my	1
works;	1
I	1
want	1
to	1
make	1
money,	1
without	1
which	1
reputation	1
is	1
not	1
worth	1
a	1
rap.”	1
“God	1
send	1
your	1
worship	1
good	1
luck,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
and	1
he	1
moved	1
on	1
to	1
another	1
case,	1
where	1
he	1
saw	1
them	1
correcting	1
a	1
sheet	1
of	1
a	1
book	1
with	1
the	1
title	1
of	1
“Light	1
of	1
the	1
Soul;”	1
noticing	1
it	1
he	1
observed,	1
“Books	1
like	1
this,	1
though	1
there	1
are	1
many	1
of	1
the	1
kind,	1
are	1
the	1
ones	1
that	1
deserve	1
to	1
be	1
printed,	1
for	1
many	1
are	1
the	1
sinners	1
in	1
these	1
days,	1
and	1
lights	1
unnumbered	1
are	1
needed	1
for	1
all	1
that	1
are	1
in	1
darkness.”	1
He	1
passed	1
on,	1
and	1
saw	1
they	1
were	1
also	1
correcting	1
another	1
book,	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
asked	1
its	1
title	1
they	1
told	1
him	1
it	1
was	1
called,	1
“The	1
Second	1
Part	1
of	1
the	1
Ingenious	1
Gentleman	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
of	1
La	1
Mancha,”	1
by	1
one	1
of	1
Tordesillas.	1
“I	1
have	1
heard	1
of	1
this	1
book	1
already,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“and	1
verily	1
and	1
on	1
my	1
conscience	1
I	1
thought	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
by	1
this	1
time	1
burned	1
to	1
ashes	1
as	1
a	1
meddlesome	1
intruder;	1
but	1
its	1
Martinmas	1
will	1
come	1
to	1
it	1
as	1
it	1
does	1
to	1
every	1
pig;	1
for	1
fictions	1
have	1
the	1
more	1
merit	1
and	1
charm	1
about	1
them	1
the	1
more	1
nearly	1
they	1
approach	1
the	1
truth	1
or	1
what	1
looks	1
like	1
it;	1
and	1
true	1
stories,	1
the	1
truer	1
they	1
are	1
the	1
better	1
they	1
are;”	1
and	1
so	1
saying	1
he	1
walked	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
printing	1
office	1
with	1
a	1
certain	1
amount	1
of	1
displeasure	1
in	1
his	1
looks.	1
That	1
same	1
day	1
Don	1
Antonio	1
arranged	1
to	1
take	1
him	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
galleys	1
that	1
lay	1
at	1
the	1
beach,	1
whereat	1
Sancho	1
was	1
in	1
high	1
delight,	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
never	1
seen	1
any	1
all	1
his	1
life.	1
Don	1
Antonio	1
sent	1
word	1
to	1
the	1
commandant	1
of	1
the	1
galleys	1
that	1
he	1
intended	1
to	1
bring	1
his	1
guest,	1
the	1
famous	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
of	1
La	1
Mancha,	1
of	1
whom	1
the	1
commandant	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
citizens	1
had	1
already	1
heard,	1
that	1
afternoon	1
to	1
see	1
them;	1
and	1
what	1
happened	1
on	1
board	1

Profound	1
were	1
Don	1
Quixote’s	1
reflections	1
on	1
the	1
reply	1
of	1
the	1
enchanted	1
head,	1
not	1
one	1
of	1
them,	1
however,	1
hitting	1
on	1
the	1
secret	1
of	1
the	1
trick,	1
but	1
all	1
concentrated	1
on	1
the	1
promise,	1
which	1
he	1
regarded	1
as	1
a	1
certainty,	1
of	1
Dulcinea’s	1
disenchantment.	1
This	1
he	1
turned	1
over	1
in	1
his	1
mind	1
again	1
and	1
again	1
with	1
great	1
satisfaction,	1
fully	1
persuaded	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
shortly	1
see	1
its	1
fulfillment;	1
and	1
as	1
for	1
Sancho,	1
though,	1
as	1
has	1
been	1
said,	1
he	1
hated	1
being	1
a	1
governor,	1
still	1
he	1
had	1
a	1
longing	1
to	1
be	1
giving	1
orders	1
and	1
finding	1
himself	1
obeyed	1
once	1
more;	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
misfortune	1
that	1
being	1
in	1
authority,	1
even	1
in	1
jest,	1
brings	1
with	1
it.	1
To	1
resume;	1
that	1
afternoon	1
their	1
host	1
Don	1
Antonio	1
Moreno	1
and	1
his	1
two	1
friends,	1
with	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
and	1
Sancho,	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
galleys.	1
The	1
commandant	1
had	1
been	1
already	1
made	1
aware	1
of	1
his	1
good	1
fortune	1
in	1
seeing	1
two	1
such	1
famous	1
persons	1
as	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
and	1
Sancho,	1
and	1
the	1
instant	1
they	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
shore	1
all	1
the	1
galleys	1
struck	1
their	1
awnings	1
and	1
the	1
clarions	1
rang	1
out.	1
A	1
skiff	1
covered	1
with	1
rich	1
carpets	1
and	1
cushions	1
of	1
crimson	1
velvet	1
was	1
immediately	1
lowered	1
into	1
the	1
water,	1
and	1
as	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
stepped	1
on	1
board	1
of	1
it,	1
the	1
leading	1
galley	1
fired	1
her	1
gangway	1
gun,	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
galleys	1
did	1
the	1
same;	1
and	1
as	1
he	1
mounted	1
the	1
starboard	1
ladder	1
the	1
whole	1
crew	1
saluted	1
him	1
(as	1
is	1
the	1
custom	1
when	1
a	1
personage	1
of	1
distinction	1
comes	1
on	1
board	1
a	1
galley)	1
by	1
exclaiming	1
“Hu,	1
hu,	1
hu,”	1
three	1
times.	1
The	1
general,	1
for	1
so	1
we	1
shall	1
call	1
him,	1
a	1
Valencian	1
gentleman	1
of	1
rank,	1
gave	1
him	1
his	1
hand	1
and	1
embraced	1
him,	1
saying,	1
“I	1
shall	1
mark	1
this	1
day	1
with	1
a	1
white	1
stone	1
as	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
happiest	1
I	1
can	1
expect	1
to	1
enjoy	1
in	1
my	1
lifetime,	1
since	1
I	1
have	1
seen	1
Señor	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
of	1
La	1
Mancha,	1
pattern	1
and	1
image	1
wherein	1
we	1
see	1
contained	1
and	1
condensed	1
all	1
that	1
is	1
worthy	1
in	1
knight-errantry.”	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
delighted	1
beyond	1
measure	1
with	1
such	1
a	1
lordly	1
reception,	1
replied	1
to	1
him	1
in	1
words	1
no	1
less	1
courteous.	1
All	1
then	1
proceeded	1
to	1
the	1
poop,	1
which	1
was	1
very	1
handsomely	1
decorated,	1
and	1
seated	1
themselves	1
on	1
the	1
bulwark	1
benches;	1
the	1
boatswain	1
passed	1
along	1
the	1
gangway	1
and	1
piped	1
all	1
hands	1
to	1
strip,	1
which	1
they	1
did	1
in	1
an	1
instant.	1
Sancho,	1
seeing	1
such	1
a	1
number	1
of	1
men	1
stripped	1
to	1
the	1
skin,	1
was	1
taken	1
aback,	1
and	1
still	1
more	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
them	1
spread	1
the	1
awning	1
so	1
briskly	1
that	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
as	1
if	1
all	1
the	1
devils	1
were	1
at	1
work	1
at	1
it;	1
but	1
all	1
this	1
was	1
cakes	1
and	1
fancy	1
bread	1
to	1
what	1
I	1
am	1
going	1
to	1
tell	1
now.	1
Sancho	1
was	1
seated	1
on	1
the	1
captain’s	1
stage,	1
close	1
to	1
the	1
aftermost	1
rower	1
on	1
the	1
right-hand	1
side.	1
He,	1
previously	1
instructed	1
in	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
to	1
do,	1
laid	1
hold	1
of	1
Sancho,	1
hoisting	1
him	1
up	1
in	1
his	1
arms,	1
and	1
the	1
whole	1
crew,	1
who	1
were	1
standing	1
ready,	1
beginning	1
on	1
the	1
right,	1
proceeded	1
to	1
pass	1
him	1
on,	1
whirling	1
him	1
along	1
from	1
hand	1
to	1
hand	1
and	1
from	1
bench	1
to	1
bench	1
with	1
such	1
rapidity	1
that	1
it	1
took	1
the	1
sight	1
out	1
of	1
poor	1
Sancho’s	1
eyes,	1
and	1
he	1
made	1
quite	1
sure	1
that	1
the	1
devils	1
themselves	1
were	1
flying	1
away	1
with	1
him;	1
nor	1
did	1
they	1
leave	1
off	1
with	1
him	1
until	1
they	1
had	1
sent	1
him	1
back	1
along	1
the	1
left	1
side	1
and	1
deposited	1
him	1
on	1
the	1
poop;	1
and	1
the	1
poor	1
fellow	1
was	1
left	1
bruised	1
and	1
breathless	1
and	1
all	1
in	1
a	1
sweat,	1
and	1
unable	1
to	1
comprehend	1
what	1
it	1
was	1
that	1
had	1
happened	1
to	1
him.	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
Sancho’s	1
flight	1
without	1
wings	1
asked	1
the	1
general	1
if	1
this	1
was	1
a	1
usual	1
ceremony	1
with	1
those	1
who	1
came	1
on	1
board	1
the	1
galleys	1
for	1
the	1
first	1
time;	1
for,	1
if	1
so,	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
no	1
intention	1
of	1
adopting	1
them	1
as	1
a	1
profession,	1
he	1
had	1
no	1
mind	1
to	1
perform	1
such	1
feats	1
of	1
agility,	1
and	1
if	1
anyone	1
offered	1
to	1
lay	1
hold	1
of	1
him	1
to	1
whirl	1
him	1
about,	1
he	1
vowed	1
to	1
God	1
he	1
would	1
kick	1
his	1
soul	1
out;	1
and	1
as	1
he	1
said	1
this	1
he	1
stood	1
up	1
and	1
clapped	1
his	1
hand	1
upon	1
his	1
sword.	1
At	1
this	1
instant	1
they	1
struck	1
the	1
awning	1
and	1
lowered	1
the	1
yard	1
with	1
a	1
prodigious	1
rattle.	1
Sancho	1
thought	1
heaven	1
was	1
coming	1
off	1
its	1
hinges	1
and	1
going	1
to	1
fall	1
on	1
his	1
head,	1
and	1
full	1
of	1
terror	1
he	1
ducked	1
it	1
and	1
buried	1
it	1
between	1
his	1
knees;	1
nor	1
were	1
Don	1
Quixote’s	1
knees	1
altogether	1
under	1
control,	1
for	1
he	1
too	1
shook	1
a	1
little,	1
squeezed	1
his	1
shoulders	1
together	1
and	1
lost	1
colour.	1
The	1
crew	1
then	1
hoisted	1
the	1
yard	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
rapidity	1
and	1
clatter	1
as	1
when	1
they	1
lowered	1
it,	1
all	1
the	1
while	1
keeping	1
silence	1
as	1
though	1
they	1
had	1
neither	1
voice	1
nor	1
breath.	1
The	1
boatswain	1
gave	1
the	1
signal	1
to	1
weigh	1
anchor,	1
and	1
leaping	1
upon	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
gangway	1
began	1
to	1
lay	1
on	1
to	1
the	1
shoulders	1
of	1
the	1
crew	1
with	1
his	1
courbash	1
or	1
whip,	1
and	1
to	1
haul	1
out	1
gradually	1
to	1
sea.	1
When	1
Sancho	1
saw	1
so	1
many	1
red	1
feet	1
(for	1
such	1
he	1
took	1
the	1
oars	1
to	1
be)	1
moving	1
all	1
together,	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
himself,	1
“It’s	1
these	1
that	1
are	1
the	1
real	1
chanted	1
things,	1
and	1
not	1
the	1
ones	1
my	1
master	1
talks	1
of.	1
What	1
can	1
those	1
wretches	1
have	1
done	1
to	1
be	1
so	1
whipped;	1
and	1
how	1
does	1
that	1
one	1
man	1
who	1
goes	1
along	1
there	1
whistling	1
dare	1
to	1
whip	1
so	1
many?	1
I	1
declare	1
this	1
is	1
hell,	1
or	1
at	1
least	1
purgatory!”	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
observing	1
how	1
attentively	1
Sancho	1
regarded	1
what	1
was	1
going	1
on,	1
said	1
to	1
him,	1
“Ah,	1
Sancho	1
my	1
friend,	1
how	1
quickly	1
and	1
cheaply	1
might	1
you	1
finish	1
off	1
the	1
disenchantment	1
of	1
Dulcinea,	1
if	1
you	1
would	1
strip	1
to	1
the	1
waist	1
and	1
take	1
your	1
place	1
among	1
those	1
gentlemen!	1
Amid	1
the	1
pain	1
and	1
sufferings	1
of	1
so	1
many	1
you	1
would	1
not	1
feel	1
your	1
own	1
much;	1
and	1
moreover	1
perhaps	1
the	1
sage	1
Merlin	1
would	1
allow	1
each	1
of	1
these	1
lashes,	1
being	1
laid	1
on	1
with	1
a	1
good	1
hand,	1
to	1
count	1
for	1
ten	1
of	1
those	1
which	1
you	1
must	1
give	1
yourself	1
at	1
last.”	1
The	1
general	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
ask	1
what	1
these	1
lashes	1
were,	1
and	1
what	1
was	1
Dulcinea’s	1
disenchantment,	1
when	1
a	1
sailor	1
exclaimed,	1
“Monjui	1
signals	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
an	1
oared	1
vessel	1
off	1
the	1
coast	1
to	1
the	1
west.”	1
On	1
hearing	1
this	1
the	1
general	1
sprang	1
upon	1
the	1
gangway	1
crying,	1
“Now	1
then,	1
my	1
sons,	1
don’t	1
let	1
her	1
give	1
us	1
the	1
slip!	1
It	1
must	1
be	1
some	1
Algerine	1
corsair	1
brigantine	1
that	1
the	1
watchtower	1
signals	1
to	1
us.”	1
The	1
three	1
others	1
immediately	1
came	1
alongside	1
the	1
chief	1
galley	1
to	1
receive	1
their	1
orders.	1
The	1
general	1
ordered	1
two	1
to	1
put	1
out	1
to	1
sea	1
while	1
he	1
with	1
the	1
other	1
kept	1
in	1
shore,	1
so	1
that	1
in	1
this	1
way	1
the	1
vessel	1
could	1
not	1
escape	1
them.	1
The	1
crews	1
plied	1
the	1
oars	1
driving	1
the	1
galleys	1
so	1
furiously	1
that	1
they	1
seemed	1
to	1
fly.	1
The	1
two	1
that	1
had	1
put	1
out	1
to	1
sea,	1
after	1
a	1
couple	1
of	1
miles	1
sighted	1
a	1
vessel	1
which,	1
so	1
far	1
as	1
they	1
could	1
make	1
out,	1
they	1
judged	1
to	1
be	1
one	1
of	1
fourteen	1
or	1
fifteen	1
banks,	1
and	1
so	1
she	1
proved.	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
the	1
vessel	1
discovered	1
the	1
galleys	1
she	1
went	1
about	1
with	1
the	1
object	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
hope	1
of	1
making	1
her	1
escape	1
by	1
her	1
speed;	1
but	1
the	1
attempt	1
failed,	1
for	1
the	1
chief	1
galley	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
fastest	1
vessels	1
afloat,	1
and	1
overhauled	1
her	1
so	1
rapidly	1
that	1
they	1
on	1
board	1
the	1
brigantine	1
saw	1
clearly	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
possibility	1
of	1
escaping,	1
and	1
the	1
rais	1
therefore	1
would	1
have	1
had	1
them	1
drop	1
their	1
oars	1
and	1
give	1
themselves	1
up	1
so	1
as	1
not	1
to	1
provoke	1
the	1
captain	1
in	1
command	1
of	1
our	1
galleys	1
to	1
anger.	1
But	1
chance,	1
directing	1
things	1
otherwise,	1
so	1
ordered	1
it	1
that	1
just	1
as	1
the	1
chief	1
galley	1
came	1
close	1
enough	1
for	1
those	1
on	1
board	1
the	1
vessel	1
to	1
hear	1
the	1
shouts	1
from	1
her	1
calling	1
on	1
them	1
to	1
surrender,	1
two	1
Toraquis,	1
that	1
is	1
to	1
say	1
two	1
Turks,	1
both	1
drunken,	1
that	1
with	1
a	1
dozen	1
more	1
were	1
on	1
board	1
the	1
brigantine,	1
discharged	1
their	1
muskets,	1
killing	1
two	1
of	1
the	1
soldiers	1
that	1
lined	1
the	1
sides	1
of	1
our	1
vessel.	1
Seeing	1
this	1
the	1
general	1
swore	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
leave	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
he	1
found	1
on	1
board	1
the	1
vessel	1
alive,	1
but	1
as	1
he	1
bore	1
down	1
furiously	1
upon	1
her	1
she	1
slipped	1
away	1
from	1
him	1
underneath	1
the	1
oars.	1
The	1
galley	1
shot	1
a	1
good	1
way	1
ahead;	1
those	1
on	1
board	1
the	1
vessel	1
saw	1
their	1
case	1
was	1
desperate,	1
and	1
while	1
the	1
galley	1
was	1
coming	1
about	1
they	1
made	1
sail,	1
and	1
by	1
sailing	1
and	1
rowing	1
once	1
more	1
tried	1
to	1
sheer	1
off;	1
but	1
their	1
activity	1
did	1
not	1
do	1
them	1
as	1
much	1
good	1
as	1
their	1
rashness	1
did	1
them	1
harm,	1
for	1
the	1
galley	1
coming	1
up	1
with	1
them	1
in	1
a	1
little	1
more	1
than	1
half	1
a	1
mile	1
threw	1
her	1
oars	1
over	1
them	1
and	1
took	1
the	1
whole	1
of	1
them	1
alive.	1
The	1
other	1
two	1
galleys	1
now	1
joined	1
company	1
and	1
all	1
four	1
returned	1
with	1
the	1
prize	1
to	1
the	1
beach,	1
where	1
a	1
vast	1
multitude	1
stood	1
waiting	1
for	1
them,	1
eager	1
to	1
see	1
what	1
they	1
brought	1
back.	1
The	1
general	1
anchored	1
close	1
in,	1
and	1
perceived	1
that	1
the	1
viceroy	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
was	1
on	1
the	1
shore.	1
He	1
ordered	1
the	1
skiff	1
to	1
push	1
off	1
to	1
fetch	1
him,	1
and	1
the	1
yard	1
to	1
be	1
lowered	1
for	1
the	1
purpose	1
of	1
hanging	1
forthwith	1
the	1
rais	1
and	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
men	1
taken	1
on	1
board	1
the	1
vessel,	1
about	1
six-and-thirty	1
in	1
number,	1
all	1
smart	1
fellows	1
and	1
most	1
of	1
them	1
Turkish	1
musketeers.	1
He	1
asked	1
which	1
was	1
the	1
rais	1
of	1
the	1
brigantine,	1
and	1
was	1
answered	1
in	1
Spanish	1
by	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
prisoners	1
(who	1
afterwards	1
proved	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
Spanish	1
renegade),	1
“This	1
young	1
man,	1
señor	1
that	1
you	1
see	1
here	1
is	1
our	1
rais,”	1
and	1
he	1
pointed	1
to	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
handsomest	1
and	1
most	1
gallant-looking	1
youths	1
that	1
could	1
be	1
imagined.	1
He	1
did	1
not	1
seem	1
to	1
be	1
twenty	1
years	1
of	1
age.	1
“Tell	1
me,	1
dog,”	1
said	1
the	1
general,	1
“what	1
led	1
thee	1
to	1
kill	1
my	1
soldiers,	1
when	1
thou	1
sawest	1
it	1
was	1
impossible	1
for	1
thee	1
to	1
escape?	1
Is	1
that	1
the	1
way	1
to	1
behave	1
to	1
chief	1
galleys?	1
Knowest	1
thou	1
not	1
that	1
rashness	1
is	1
not	1
valour?	1
Faint	1
prospects	1
of	1
success	1
should	1
make	1
men	1
bold,	1
but	1
not	1
rash.”	1
The	1
rais	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
reply,	1
but	1
the	1
general	1
could	1
not	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
listen	1
to	1
him,	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
hasten	1
to	1
receive	1
the	1
viceroy,	1
who	1
was	1
now	1
coming	1
on	1
board	1
the	1
galley,	1
and	1
with	1
him	1
certain	1
of	1
his	1
attendants	1
and	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
people.	1
“You	1
have	1
had	1
a	1
good	1
chase,	1
señor	1
general,”	1
said	1
the	1
viceroy.	1
“Your	1
excellency	1
shall	1
soon	1
see	1
how	1
good,	1
by	1
the	1
game	1
strung	1
up	1
to	1
this	1
yard,”	1
replied	1
the	1
general.	1
“How	1
so?”	1
returned	1
the	1
viceroy.	1
“Because,”	1
said	1
the	1
general,	1
“against	1
all	1
law,	1
reason,	1
and	1
usages	1
of	1
war	1
they	1
have	1
killed	1
on	1
my	1
hands	1
two	1
of	1
the	1
best	1
soldiers	1
on	1
board	1
these	1
galleys,	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
sworn	1
to	1
hang	1
every	1
man	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
taken,	1
but	1
above	1
all	1
this	1
youth	1
who	1
is	1
the	1
rais	1
of	1
the	1
brigantine,”	1
and	1
he	1
pointed	1
to	1
him	1
as	1
he	1
stood	1
with	1
his	1
hands	1
already	1
bound	1
and	1
the	1
rope	1
round	1
his	1
neck,	1
ready	1
for	1
death.	1
The	1
viceroy	1
looked	1
at	1
him,	1
and	1
seeing	1
him	1
so	1
well-favoured,	1
so	1
graceful,	1
and	1
so	1
submissive,	1
he	1
felt	1
a	1
desire	1
to	1
spare	1
his	1
life,	1
the	1
comeliness	1
of	1
the	1
youth	1
furnishing	1
him	1
at	1
once	1
with	1
a	1
letter	1
of	1
recommendation.	1
He	1
therefore	1
questioned	1
him,	1
saying,	1
“Tell	1
me,	1
rais,	1
art	1
thou	1
Turk,	1
Moor,	1
or	1
renegade?”	1
To	1
which	1
the	1
youth	1
replied,	1
also	1
in	1
Spanish,	1
“I	1
am	1
neither	1
Turk,	1
nor	1
Moor,	1
nor	1
renegade.”	1
“What	1
art	1
thou,	1
then?”	1
said	1
the	1
viceroy.	1
“A	1
Christian	1
woman,”	1
replied	1
the	1
youth.	1
“A	1
woman	1
and	1
a	1
Christian,	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
dress	1
and	1
in	1
such	1
circumstances!	1
It	1
is	1
more	1
marvellous	1
than	1
credible,”	1
said	1
the	1
viceroy.	1
“Suspend	1
the	1
execution	1
of	1
the	1
sentence,”	1
said	1
the	1
youth;	1
“your	1
vengeance	1
will	1
not	1
lose	1
much	1
by	1
waiting	1
while	1
I	1
tell	1
you	1
the	1
story	1
of	1
my	1
life.”	1
What	1
heart	1
could	1
be	1
so	1
hard	1
as	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
softened	1
by	1
these	1
words,	1
at	1
any	1
rate	1
so	1
far	1
as	1
to	1
listen	1
to	1
what	1
the	1
unhappy	1
youth	1
had	1
to	1
say?	1
The	1
general	1
bade	1
him	1
say	1
what	1
he	1
pleased,	1
but	1
not	1
to	1
expect	1
pardon	1
for	1
his	1
flagrant	1
offence.	1
With	1
this	1
permission	1
the	1
youth	1
began	1
in	1
these	1
words.	1
“Born	1
of	1
Morisco	1
parents,	1
I	1
am	1
of	1
that	1
nation,	1
more	1
unhappy	1
than	1
wise,	1
upon	1
which	1
of	1
late	1
a	1
sea	1
of	1
woes	1
has	1
poured	1
down.	1
In	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
our	1
misfortune	1
I	1
was	1
carried	1
to	1
Barbary	1
by	1
two	1
uncles	1
of	1
mine,	1
for	1
it	1
was	1
in	1
vain	1
that	1
I	1
declared	1
I	1
was	1
a	1
Christian,	1
as	1
in	1
fact	1
I	1
am,	1
and	1
not	1
a	1
mere	1
pretended	1
one,	1
or	1
outwardly,	1
but	1
a	1
true	1
Catholic	1
Christian.	1
It	1
availed	1
me	1
nothing	1
with	1
those	1
charged	1
with	1
our	1
sad	1
expatriation	1
to	1
protest	1
this,	1
nor	1
would	1
my	1
uncles	1
believe	1
it;	1
on	1
the	1
contrary,	1
they	1
treated	1
it	1
as	1
an	1
untruth	1
and	1
a	1
subterfuge	1
set	1
up	1
to	1
enable	1
me	1
to	1
remain	1
behind	1
in	1
the	1
land	1
of	1
my	1
birth;	1
and	1
so,	1
more	1
by	1
force	1
than	1
of	1
my	1
own	1
will,	1
they	1
took	1
me	1
with	1
them.	1
I	1
had	1
a	1
Christian	1
mother,	1
and	1
a	1
father	1
who	1
was	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
sound	1
sense	1
and	1
a	1
Christian	1
too;	1
I	1
imbibed	1
the	1
Catholic	1
faith	1
with	1
my	1
mother’s	1
milk,	1
I	1
was	1
well	1
brought	1
up,	1
and	1
neither	1
in	1
word	1
nor	1
in	1
deed	1
did	1
I,	1
I	1
think,	1
show	1
any	1
sign	1
of	1
being	1
a	1
Morisco.	1
To	1
accompany	1
these	1
virtues,	1
for	1
such	1
I	1
hold	1
them,	1
my	1
beauty,	1
if	1
I	1
possess	1
any,	1
grew	1
with	1
my	1
growth;	1
and	1
great	1
as	1
was	1
the	1
seclusion	1
in	1
which	1
I	1
lived	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
so	1
great	1
but	1
that	1
a	1
young	1
gentleman,	1
Don	1
Gaspar	1
Gregorio	1
by	1
name,	1
eldest	1
son	1
of	1
a	1
gentleman	1
who	1
is	1
lord	1
of	1
a	1
village	1
near	1
ours,	1
contrived	1
to	1
find	1
opportunities	1
of	1
seeing	1
me.	1
How	1
he	1
saw	1
me,	1
how	1
we	1
met,	1
how	1
his	1
heart	1
was	1
lost	1
to	1
me,	1
and	1
mine	1
not	1
kept	1
from	1
him,	1
would	1
take	1
too	1
long	1
to	1
tell,	1
especially	1
at	1
a	1
moment	1
when	1
I	1
am	1
in	1
dread	1
of	1
the	1
cruel	1
cord	1
that	1
threatens	1
me	1
interposing	1
between	1
tongue	1
and	1
throat;	1
I	1
will	1
only	1
say,	1
therefore,	1
that	1
Don	1
Gregorio	1
chose	1
to	1
accompany	1
me	1
in	1
our	1
banishment.	1
He	1
joined	1
company	1
with	1
the	1
Moriscoes	1
who	1
were	1
going	1
forth	1
from	1
other	1
villages,	1
for	1
he	1
knew	1
their	1
language	1
very	1
well,	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
voyage	1
he	1
struck	1
up	1
a	1
friendship	1
with	1
my	1
two	1
uncles	1
who	1
were	1
carrying	1
me	1
with	1
them;	1
for	1
my	1
father,	1
like	1
a	1
wise	1
and	1
far-sighted	1
man,	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
heard	1
the	1
first	1
edict	1
for	1
our	1
expulsion,	1
quitted	1
the	1
village	1
and	1
departed	1
in	1
quest	1
of	1
some	1
refuge	1
for	1
us	1
abroad.	1
He	1
left	1
hidden	1
and	1
buried,	1
at	1
a	1
spot	1
of	1
which	1
I	1
alone	1
have	1
knowledge,	1
a	1
large	1
quantity	1
of	1
pearls	1
and	1
precious	1
stones	1
of	1
great	1
value,	1
together	1
with	1
a	1
sum	1
of	1
money	1
in	1
gold	1
cruzadoes	1
and	1
doubloons.	1
He	1
charged	1
me	1
on	1
no	1
account	1
to	1
touch	1
the	1
treasure,	1
if	1
by	1
any	1
chance	1
they	1
expelled	1
us	1
before	1
his	1
return.	1
I	1
obeyed	1
him,	1
and	1
with	1
my	1
uncles,	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
said,	1
and	1
others	1
of	1
our	1
kindred	1
and	1
neighbours,	1
passed	1
over	1
to	1
Barbary,	1
and	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
we	1
took	1
up	1
our	1
abode	1
was	1
Algiers,	1
much	1
the	1
same	1
as	1
if	1
we	1
had	1
taken	1
it	1
up	1
in	1
hell	1
itself.	1
The	1
king	1
heard	1
of	1
my	1
beauty,	1
and	1
report	1
told	1
him	1
of	1
my	1
wealth,	1
which	1
was	1
in	1
some	1
degree	1
fortunate	1
for	1
me.	1
He	1
summoned	1
me	1
before	1
him,	1
and	1
asked	1
me	1
what	1
part	1
of	1
Spain	1
I	1
came	1
from,	1
and	1
what	1
money	1
and	1
jewels	1
I	1
had.	1
I	1
mentioned	1
the	1
place,	1
and	1
told	1
him	1
the	1
jewels	1
and	1
money	1
were	1
buried	1
there;	1
but	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
easily	1
be	1
recovered	1
if	1
I	1
myself	1
went	1
back	1
for	1
them.	1
All	1
this	1
I	1
told	1
him,	1
in	1
dread	1
lest	1
my	1
beauty	1
and	1
not	1
his	1
own	1
covetousness	1
should	1
influence	1
him.	1
While	1
he	1
was	1
engaged	1
in	1
conversation	1
with	1
me,	1
they	1
brought	1
him	1
word	1
that	1
in	1
company	1
with	1
me	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
handsomest	1
and	1
most	1
graceful	1
youths	1
that	1
could	1
be	1
imagined.	1
I	1
knew	1
at	1
once	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
speaking	1
of	1
Don	1
Gaspar	1
Gregorio,	1
whose	1
comeliness	1
surpasses	1
the	1
most	1
highly	1
vaunted	1
beauty.	1
I	1
was	1
troubled	1
when	1
I	1
thought	1
of	1
the	1
danger	1
he	1
was	1
in,	1
for	1
among	1
those	1
barbarous	1
Turks	1
a	1
fair	1
youth	1
is	1
more	1
esteemed	1
than	1
a	1
woman,	1
be	1
she	1
ever	1
so	1
beautiful.	1
The	1
king	1
immediately	1
ordered	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
brought	1
before	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
see	1
him,	1
and	1
asked	1
me	1
if	1
what	1
they	1
said	1
about	1
the	1
youth	1
was	1
true.	1
I	1
then,	1
almost	1
as	1
if	1
inspired	1
by	1
heaven,	1
told	1
him	1
it	1
was,	1
but	1
that	1
I	1
would	1
have	1
him	1
to	1
know	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
man,	1
but	1
a	1
woman	1
like	1
myself,	1
and	1
I	1
entreated	1
him	1
to	1
allow	1
me	1
to	1
go	1
and	1
dress	1
her	1
in	1
the	1
attire	1
proper	1
to	1
her,	1
so	1
that	1
her	1
beauty	1
might	1
be	1
seen	1
to	1
perfection,	1
and	1
that	1
she	1
might	1
present	1
herself	1
before	1
him	1
with	1
less	1
embarrassment.	1
He	1
bade	1
me	1
go	1
by	1
all	1
means,	1
and	1
said	1
that	1
the	1
next	1
day	1
we	1
should	1
discuss	1
the	1
plan	1
to	1
be	1
adopted	1
for	1
my	1
return	1
to	1
Spain	1
to	1
carry	1
away	1
the	1
hidden	1
treasure.	1
I	1
saw	1
Don	1
Gaspar,	1
I	1
told	1
him	1
the	1
danger	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
if	1
he	1
let	1
it	1
be	1
seen	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
man,	1
I	1
dressed	1
him	1
as	1
a	1
Moorish	1
woman,	1
and	1
that	1
same	1
afternoon	1
I	1
brought	1
him	1
before	1
the	1
king,	1
who	1
was	1
charmed	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
him,	1
and	1
resolved	1
to	1
keep	1
the	1
damsel	1
and	1
make	1
a	1
present	1
of	1
her	1
to	1
the	1
Grand	1
Signor;	1
and	1
to	1
avoid	1
the	1
risk	1
she	1
might	1
run	1
among	1
the	1
women	1
of	1
his	1
seraglio,	1
and	1
distrustful	1
of	1
himself,	1
he	1
commanded	1
her	1
to	1
be	1
placed	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
of	1
some	1
Moorish	1
ladies	1
of	1
rank	1
who	1
would	1
protect	1
and	1
attend	1
to	1
her;	1
and	1
thither	1
he	1
was	1
taken	1
at	1
once.	1
What	1
we	1
both	1
suffered	1
(for	1
I	1
cannot	1
deny	1
that	1
I	1
love	1
him)	1
may	1
be	1
left	1
to	1
the	1
imagination	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
are	1
separated	1
if	1
they	1
love	1
one	1
another	1
dearly.	1
The	1
king	1
then	1
arranged	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
return	1
to	1
Spain	1
in	1
this	1
brigantine,	1
and	1
that	1
two	1
Turks,	1
those	1
who	1
killed	1
your	1
soldiers,	1
should	1
accompany	1
me.	1
There	1
also	1
came	1
with	1
me	1
this	1
Spanish	1
renegade”—and	1
here	1
she	1
pointed	1
to	1
him	1
who	1
had	1
first	1
spoken—“whom	1
I	1
know	1
to	1
be	1
secretly	1
a	1
Christian,	1
and	1
to	1
be	1
more	1
desirous	1
of	1
being	1
left	1
in	1
Spain	1
than	1
of	1
returning	1
to	1
Barbary.	1
The	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
crew	1
of	1
the	1
brigantine	1
are	1
Moors	1
and	1
Turks,	1
who	1
merely	1
serve	1
as	1
rowers.	1
The	1
two	1
Turks,	1
greedy	1
and	1
insolent,	1
instead	1
of	1
obeying	1
the	1
orders	1
we	1
had	1
to	1
land	1
me	1
and	1
this	1
renegade	1
in	1
Christian	1
dress	1
(with	1
which	1
we	1
came	1
provided)	1
on	1
the	1
first	1
Spanish	1
ground	1
we	1
came	1
to,	1
chose	1
to	1
run	1
along	1
the	1
coast	1
and	1
make	1
some	1
prize	1
if	1
they	1
could,	1
fearing	1
that	1
if	1
they	1
put	1
us	1
ashore	1
first,	1
we	1
might,	1
in	1
case	1
of	1
some	1
accident	1
befalling	1
us,	1
make	1
it	1
known	1
that	1
the	1
brigantine	1
was	1
at	1
sea,	1
and	1
thus,	1
if	1
there	1
happened	1
to	1
be	1
any	1
galleys	1
on	1
the	1
coast,	1
they	1
might	1
be	1
taken.	1
We	1
sighted	1
this	1
shore	1
last	1
night,	1
and	1
knowing	1
nothing	1
of	1
these	1
galleys,	1
we	1
were	1
discovered,	1
and	1
the	1
result	1
was	1
what	1
you	1
have	1
seen.	1
To	1
sum	1
up,	1
there	1
is	1
Don	1
Gregorio	1
in	1
woman’s	1
dress,	1
among	1
women,	1
in	1
imminent	1
danger	1
of	1
his	1
life;	1
and	1
here	1
am	1
I,	1
with	1
hands	1
bound,	1
in	1
expectation,	1
or	1
rather	1
in	1
dread,	1
of	1
losing	1
my	1
life,	1
of	1
which	1
I	1
am	1
already	1
weary.	1
Here,	1
sirs,	1
ends	1
my	1
sad	1
story,	1
as	1
true	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
unhappy;	1
all	1
I	1
ask	1
of	1
you	1
is	1
to	1
allow	1
me	1
to	1
die	1
like	1
a	1
Christian,	1
for,	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
already	1
said,	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
charged	1
with	1
the	1
offence	1
of	1
which	1
those	1
of	1
my	1
nation	1
are	1
guilty;”	1
and	1
she	1
stood	1
silent,	1
her	1
eyes	1
filled	1
with	1
moving	1
tears,	1
accompanied	1
by	1
plenty	1
from	1
the	1
bystanders.	1
The	1
viceroy,	1
touched	1
with	1
compassion,	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
her	1
without	1
speaking	1
and	1
untied	1
the	1
cord	1
that	1
bound	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
the	1
Moorish	1
girl.	1
But	1
all	1
the	1
while	1
the	1
Morisco	1
Christian	1
was	1
telling	1
her	1
strange	1
story,	1
an	1
elderly	1
pilgrim,	1
who	1
had	1
come	1
on	1
board	1
of	1
the	1
galley	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
as	1
the	1
viceroy,	1
kept	1
his	1
eyes	1
fixed	1
upon	1
her;	1
and	1
the	1
instant	1
she	1
ceased	1
speaking	1
he	1
threw	1
himself	1
at	1
her	1
feet,	1
and	1
embracing	1
them	1
said	1
in	1
a	1
voice	1
broken	1
by	1
sobs	1
and	1
sighs,	1
“O	1
Ana	1
Felix,	1
my	1
unhappy	1
daughter,	1
I	1
am	1
thy	1
father	1
Ricote,	1
come	1
back	1
to	1
look	1
for	1
thee,	1
unable	1
to	1
live	1
without	1
thee,	1
my	1
soul	1
that	1
thou	1
art!”	1
At	1
these	1
words	1
of	1
his,	1
Sancho	1
opened	1
his	1
eyes	1
and	1
raised	1
his	1
head,	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
holding	1
down,	1
brooding	1
over	1
his	1
unlucky	1
excursion;	1
and	1
looking	1
at	1
the	1
pilgrim	1
he	1
recognised	1
in	1
him	1
that	1
same	1
Ricote	1
he	1
met	1
the	1
day	1
he	1
quitted	1
his	1
government,	1
and	1
felt	1
satisfied	1
that	1
this	1
was	1
his	1
daughter.	1
She	1
being	1
now	1
unbound	1
embraced	1
her	1
father,	1
mingling	1
her	1
tears	1
with	1
his,	1
while	1
he	1
addressing	1
the	1
general	1
and	1
the	1
viceroy	1
said,	1
“This,	1
sirs,	1
is	1
my	1
daughter,	1
more	1
unhappy	1
in	1
her	1
adventures	1
than	1
in	1
her	1
name.	1
She	1
is	1
Ana	1
Felix,	1
surnamed	1
Ricote,	1
celebrated	1
as	1
much	1
for	1
her	1
own	1
beauty	1
as	1
for	1
my	1
wealth.	1
I	1
quitted	1
my	1
native	1
land	1
in	1
search	1
of	1
some	1
shelter	1
or	1
refuge	1
for	1
us	1
abroad,	1
and	1
having	1
found	1
one	1
in	1
Germany	1
I	1
returned	1
in	1
this	1
pilgrim’s	1
dress,	1
in	1
the	1
company	1
of	1
some	1
other	1
German	1
pilgrims,	1
to	1
seek	1
my	1
daughter	1
and	1
take	1
up	1
a	1
large	1
quantity	1
of	1
treasure	1
I	1
had	1
left	1
buried.	1
My	1
daughter	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
find,	1
the	1
treasure	1
I	1
found	1
and	1
have	1
with	1
me;	1
and	1
now,	1
in	1
this	1
strange	1
roundabout	1
way	1
you	1
have	1
seen,	1
I	1
find	1
the	1
treasure	1
that	1
more	1
than	1
all	1
makes	1
me	1
rich,	1
my	1
beloved	1
daughter.	1
If	1
our	1
innocence	1
and	1
her	1
tears	1
and	1
mine	1
can	1
with	1
strict	1
justice	1
open	1
the	1
door	1
to	1
clemency,	1
extend	1
it	1
to	1
us,	1
for	1
we	1
never	1
had	1
any	1
intention	1
of	1
injuring	1
you,	1
nor	1
do	1
we	1
sympathise	1
with	1
the	1
aims	1
of	1
our	1
people,	1
who	1
have	1
been	1
justly	1
banished.”	1
“I	1
know	1
Ricote	1
well,”	1
said	1
Sancho	1
at	1
this,	1
“and	1
I	1
know	1
too	1
that	1
what	1
he	1
says	1
about	1
Ana	1
Felix	1
being	1
his	1
daughter	1
is	1
true;	1
but	1
as	1
to	1
those	1
other	1
particulars	1
about	1
going	1
and	1
coming,	1
and	1
having	1
good	1
or	1
bad	1
intentions,	1
I	1
say	1
nothing.”	1
While	1
all	1
present	1
stood	1
amazed	1
at	1
this	1
strange	1
occurrence	1
the	1
general	1
said,	1
“At	1
any	1
rate	1
your	1
tears	1
will	1
not	1
allow	1
me	1
to	1
keep	1
my	1
oath;	1
live,	1
fair	1
Ana	1
Felix,	1
all	1
the	1
years	1
that	1
heaven	1
has	1
allotted	1
you;	1
but	1
these	1
rash	1
insolent	1
fellows	1
must	1
pay	1
the	1
penalty	1
of	1
the	1
crime	1
they	1
have	1
committed;”	1
and	1
with	1
that	1
he	1
gave	1
orders	1
to	1
have	1
the	1
two	1
Turks	1
who	1
had	1
killed	1
his	1
two	1
soldiers	1
hanged	1
at	1
once	1
at	1
the	1
yard-arm.	1
The	1
viceroy,	1
however,	1
begged	1
him	1
earnestly	1
not	1
to	1
hang	1
them,	1
as	1
their	1
behaviour	1
savoured	1
rather	1
of	1
madness	1
than	1
of	1
bravado.	1
The	1
general	1
yielded	1
to	1
the	1
viceroy’s	1
request,	1
for	1
revenge	1
is	1
not	1
easily	1
taken	1
in	1
cold	1
blood.	1
They	1
then	1
tried	1
to	1
devise	1
some	1
scheme	1
for	1
rescuing	1
Don	1
Gaspar	1
Gregorio	1
from	1
the	1
danger	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
left.	1
Ricote	1
offered	1
for	1
that	1
object	1
more	1
than	1
two	1
thousand	1
ducats	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
in	1
pearls	1
and	1
gems;	1
they	1
proposed	1
several	1
plans,	1
but	1
none	1
so	1
good	1
as	1
that	1
suggested	1
by	1
the	1
renegade	1
already	1
mentioned,	1
who	1
offered	1
to	1
return	1
to	1
Algiers	1
in	1
a	1
small	1
vessel	1
of	1
about	1
six	1
banks,	1
manned	1
by	1
Christian	1
rowers,	1
as	1
he	1
knew	1
where,	1
how,	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
could	1
and	1
should	1
land,	1
nor	1
was	1
he	1
ignorant	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
in	1
which	1
Don	1
Gaspar	1
was	1
staying.	1
The	1
general	1
and	1
the	1
viceroy	1
had	1
some	1
hesitation	1
about	1
placing	1
confidence	1
in	1
the	1
renegade	1
and	1
entrusting	1
him	1
with	1
the	1
Christians	1
who	1
were	1
to	1
row,	1
but	1
Ana	1
Felix	1
said	1
she	1
could	1
answer	1
for	1
him,	1
and	1
her	1
father	1
offered	1
to	1
go	1
and	1
pay	1
the	1
ransom	1
of	1
the	1
Christians	1
if	1
by	1
any	1
chance	1
they	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
forthcoming.	1
This,	1
then,	1
being	1
agreed	1
upon,	1
the	1
viceroy	1
landed,	1
and	1
Don	1
Antonio	1
Moreno	1
took	1
the	1
fair	1
Morisco	1
and	1
her	1
father	1
home	1
with	1
him,	1
the	1
viceroy	1
charging	1
him	1
to	1
give	1
them	1
the	1
best	1
reception	1
and	1
welcome	1
in	1
his	1
power,	1
while	1
on	1
his	1
own	1
part	1
he	1
offered	1
all	1
that	1
house	1
contained	1
for	1
their	1
entertainment;	1
so	1
great	1
was	1
the	1
good-will	1
and	1
kindliness	1
the	1
beauty	1
of	1
Ana	1
Felix	1
had	1
infused	1
into	1
his	1
heart.	1

The	1
wife	1
of	1
Don	1
Antonio	1
Moreno,	1
so	1
the	1
history	1
says,	1
was	1
extremely	1
happy	1
to	1
see	1
Ana	1
Felix	1
in	1
her	1
house.	1
She	1
welcomed	1
her	1
with	1
great	1
kindness,	1
charmed	1
as	1
well	1
by	1
her	1
beauty	1
as	1
by	1
her	1
intelligence;	1
for	1
in	1
both	1
respects	1
the	1
fair	1
Morisco	1
was	1
richly	1
endowed,	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
flocked	1
to	1
see	1
her	1
as	1
though	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
summoned	1
by	1
the	1
ringing	1
of	1
the	1
bells.	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
told	1
Don	1
Antonio	1
that	1
the	1
plan	1
adopted	1
for	1
releasing	1
Don	1
Gregorio	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
good	1
one,	1
for	1
its	1
risks	1
were	1
greater	1
than	1
its	1
advantages,	1
and	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
better	1
to	1
land	1
himself	1
with	1
his	1
arms	1
and	1
horse	1
in	1
Barbary;	1
for	1
he	1
would	1
carry	1
him	1
off	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
Moorish	1
host,	1
as	1
Don	1
Gaiferos	1
carried	1
off	1
his	1
wife	1
Melisendra.	1
“Remember,	1
your	1
worship,”	1
observed	1
Sancho	1
on	1
hearing	1
him	1
say	1
so,	1
“Señor	1
Don	1
Gaiferos	1
carried	1
off	1
his	1
wife	1
from	1
the	1
mainland,	1
and	1
took	1
her	1
to	1
France	1
by	1
land;	1
but	1
in	1
this	1
case,	1
if	1
by	1
chance	1
we	1
carry	1
off	1
Don	1
Gregorio,	1
we	1
have	1
no	1
way	1
of	1
bringing	1
him	1
to	1
Spain,	1
for	1
there’s	1
the	1
sea	1
between.”	1
“There’s	1
a	1
remedy	1
for	1
everything	1
except	1
death,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
“if	1
they	1
bring	1
the	1
vessel	1
close	1
to	1
the	1
shore	1
we	1
shall	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
get	1
on	1
board	1
though	1
all	1
the	1
world	1
strive	1
to	1
prevent	1
us.”	1
“Your	1
worship	1
hits	1
it	1
off	1
mighty	1
well	1
and	1
mighty	1
easy,”	1
said	1
Sancho;	1
“but	1
‘it’s	1
a	1
long	1
step	1
from	1
saying	1
to	1
doing;’	1
and	1
I	1
hold	1
to	1
the	1
renegade,	1
for	1
he	1
seems	1
to	1
me	1
an	1
honest	1
good-hearted	1
fellow.”	1
Don	1
Antonio	1
then	1
said	1
that	1
if	1
the	1
renegade	1
did	1
not	1
prove	1
successful,	1
the	1
expedient	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
Don	1
Quixote’s	1
expedition	1
to	1
Barbary	1
should	1
be	1
adopted.	1
Two	1
days	1
afterwards	1
the	1
renegade	1
put	1
to	1
sea	1
in	1
a	1
light	1
vessel	1
of	1
six	1
oars	1
a-side	1
manned	1
by	1
a	1
stout	1
crew,	1
and	1
two	1
days	1
later	1
the	1
galleys	1
made	1
sail	1
eastward,	1
the	1
general	1
having	1
begged	1
the	1
viceroy	1
to	1
let	1
him	1
know	1
all	1
about	1
the	1
release	1
of	1
Don	1
Gregorio	1
and	1
about	1
Ana	1
Felix,	1
and	1
the	1
viceroy	1
promised	1
to	1
do	1
as	1
he	1
requested.	1
One	1
morning	1
as	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
went	1
out	1
for	1
a	1
stroll	1
along	1
the	1
beach,	1
arrayed	1
in	1
full	1
armour	1
(for,	1
as	1
he	1
often	1
said,	1
that	1
was	1
“his	1
only	1
gear,	1
his	1
only	1
rest	1
the	1
fray,”	1
and	1
he	1
never	1
was	1
without	1
it	1
for	1
a	1
moment),	1
he	1
saw	1
coming	1
towards	1
him	1
a	1
knight,	1
also	1
in	1
full	1
armour,	1
with	1
a	1
shining	1
moon	1
painted	1
on	1
his	1
shield,	1
who,	1
on	1
approaching	1
sufficiently	1
near	1
to	1
be	1
heard,	1
said	1
in	1
a	1
loud	1
voice,	1
addressing	1
himself	1
to	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“Illustrious	1
knight,	1
and	1
never	1
sufficiently	1
extolled	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
of	1
La	1
Mancha,	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
Knight	1
of	1
the	1
White	1
Moon,	1
whose	1
unheard-of	1
achievements	1
will	1
perhaps	1
have	1
recalled	1
him	1
to	1
thy	1
memory.	1
I	1
come	1
to	1
do	1
battle	1
with	1
thee	1
and	1
prove	1
the	1
might	1
of	1
thy	1
arm,	1
to	1
the	1
end	1
that	1
I	1
make	1
thee	1
acknowledge	1
and	1
confess	1
that	1
my	1
lady,	1
let	1
her	1
be	1
who	1
she	1
may,	1
is	1
incomparably	1
fairer	1
than	1
thy	1
Dulcinea	1
del	1
Toboso.	1
If	1
thou	1
dost	1
acknowledge	1
this	1
fairly	1
and	1
openly,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
escape	1
death	1
and	1
save	1
me	1
the	1
trouble	1
of	1
inflicting	1
it	1
upon	1
thee;	1
if	1
thou	1
fightest	1
and	1
I	1
vanquish	1
thee,	1
I	1
demand	1
no	1
other	1
satisfaction	1
than	1
that,	1
laying	1
aside	1
arms	1
and	1
abstaining	1
from	1
going	1
in	1
quest	1
of	1
adventures,	1
thou	1
withdraw	1
and	1
betake	1
thyself	1
to	1
thine	1
own	1
village	1
for	1
the	1
space	1
of	1
a	1
year,	1
and	1
live	1
there	1
without	1
putting	1
hand	1
to	1
sword,	1
in	1
peace	1
and	1
quiet	1
and	1
beneficial	1
repose,	1
the	1
same	1
being	1
needful	1
for	1
the	1
increase	1
of	1
thy	1
substance	1
and	1
the	1
salvation	1
of	1
thy	1
soul;	1
and	1
if	1
thou	1
dost	1
vanquish	1
me,	1
my	1
head	1
shall	1
be	1
at	1
thy	1
disposal,	1
my	1
arms	1
and	1
horse	1
thy	1
spoils,	1
and	1
the	1
renown	1
of	1
my	1
deeds	1
transferred	1
and	1
added	1
to	1
thine.	1
Consider	1
which	1
will	1
be	1
thy	1
best	1
course,	1
and	1
give	1
me	1
thy	1
answer	1
speedily,	1
for	1
this	1
day	1
is	1
all	1
the	1
time	1
I	1
have	1
for	1
the	1
despatch	1
of	1
this	1
business.”	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
was	1
amazed	1
and	1
astonished,	1
as	1
well	1
at	1
the	1
Knight	1
of	1
the	1
White	1
Moon’s	1
arrogance,	1
as	1
at	1
his	1
reason	1
for	1
delivering	1
the	1
defiance,	1
and	1
with	1
calm	1
dignity	1
he	1
answered	1
him,	1
“Knight	1
of	1
the	1
White	1
Moon,	1
of	1
whose	1
achievements	1
I	1
have	1
never	1
heard	1
until	1
now,	1
I	1
will	1
venture	1
to	1
swear	1
you	1
have	1
never	1
seen	1
the	1
illustrious	1
Dulcinea;	1
for	1
had	1
you	1
seen	1
her	1
I	1
know	1
you	1
would	1
have	1
taken	1
care	1
not	1
to	1
venture	1
yourself	1
upon	1
this	1
issue,	1
because	1
the	1
sight	1
would	1
have	1
removed	1
all	1
doubt	1
from	1
your	1
mind	1
that	1
there	1
ever	1
has	1
been	1
or	1
can	1
be	1
a	1
beauty	1
to	1
be	1
compared	1
with	1
hers;	1
and	1
so,	1
not	1
saying	1
you	1
lie,	1
but	1
merely	1
that	1
you	1
are	1
not	1
correct	1
in	1
what	1
you	1
state,	1
I	1
accept	1
your	1
challenge,	1
with	1
the	1
conditions	1
you	1
have	1
proposed,	1
and	1
at	1
once,	1
that	1
the	1
day	1
you	1
have	1
fixed	1
may	1
not	1
expire;	1
and	1
from	1
your	1
conditions	1
I	1
except	1
only	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
renown	1
of	1
your	1
achievements	1
being	1
transferred	1
to	1
me,	1
for	1
I	1
know	1
not	1
of	1
what	1
sort	1
they	1
are	1
nor	1
what	1
they	1
may	1
amount	1
to;	1
I	1
am	1
satisfied	1
with	1
my	1
own,	1
such	1
as	1
they	1
be.	1
Take,	1
therefore,	1
the	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
field	1
you	1
choose,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
do	1
the	1
same;	1
and	1
to	1
whom	1
God	1
shall	1
give	1
it	1
may	1
Saint	1
Peter	1
add	1
his	1
blessing.”	1
The	1
Knight	1
of	1
the	1
White	1
Moon	1
had	1
been	1
seen	1
from	1
the	1
city,	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
told	1
the	1
viceroy	1
how	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
conversation	1
with	1
Don	1
Quixote.	1
The	1
viceroy,	1
fancying	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
some	1
fresh	1
adventure	1
got	1
up	1
by	1
Don	1
Antonio	1
Moreno	1
or	1
some	1
other	1
gentleman	1
of	1
the	1
city,	1
hurried	1
out	1
at	1
once	1
to	1
the	1
beach	1
accompanied	1
by	1
Don	1
Antonio	1
and	1
several	1
other	1
gentlemen,	1
just	1
as	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
was	1
wheeling	1
Rocinante	1
round	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
take	1
up	1
the	1
necessary	1
distance.	1
The	1
viceroy	1
upon	1
this,	1
seeing	1
that	1
the	1
pair	1
of	1
them	1
were	1
evidently	1
preparing	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
the	1
charge,	1
put	1
himself	1
between	1
them,	1
asking	1
them	1
what	1
it	1
was	1
that	1
led	1
them	1
to	1
engage	1
in	1
combat	1
all	1
of	1
a	1
sudden	1
in	1
this	1
way.	1
The	1
Knight	1
of	1
the	1
White	1
Moon	1
replied	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
question	1
of	1
precedence	1
of	1
beauty;	1
and	1
briefly	1
told	1
him	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
said	1
to	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
and	1
how	1
the	1
conditions	1
of	1
the	1
defiance	1
agreed	1
upon	1
on	1
both	1
sides	1
had	1
been	1
accepted.	1
The	1
viceroy	1
went	1
over	1
to	1
Don	1
Antonio,	1
and	1
asked	1
in	1
a	1
low	1
voice	1
did	1
he	1
know	1
who	1
the	1
Knight	1
of	1
the	1
White	1
Moon	1
was,	1
or	1
was	1
it	1
some	1
joke	1
they	1
were	1
playing	1
on	1
Don	1
Quixote.	1
Don	1
Antonio	1
replied	1
that	1
he	1
neither	1
knew	1
who	1
he	1
was	1
nor	1
whether	1
the	1
defiance	1
was	1
in	1
joke	1
or	1
in	1
earnest.	1
This	1
answer	1
left	1
the	1
viceroy	1
in	1
a	1
state	1
of	1
perplexity,	1
not	1
knowing	1
whether	1
he	1
ought	1
to	1
let	1
the	1
combat	1
go	1
on	1
or	1
not;	1
but	1
unable	1
to	1
persuade	1
himself	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
anything	1
but	1
a	1
joke	1
he	1
fell	1
back,	1
saying,	1
“If	1
there	1
be	1
no	1
other	1
way	1
out	1
of	1
it,	1
gallant	1
knights,	1
except	1
to	1
confess	1
or	1
die,	1
and	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
is	1
inflexible,	1
and	1
your	1
worship	1
of	1
the	1
White	1
Moon	1
still	1
more	1
so,	1
in	1
God’s	1
hand	1
be	1
it,	1
and	1
fall	1
on.”	1
He	1
of	1
the	1
White	1
Moon	1
thanked	1
the	1
viceroy	1
in	1
courteous	1
and	1
well-chosen	1
words	1
for	1
the	1
permission	1
he	1
gave	1
them,	1
and	1
so	1
did	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
who	1
then,	1
commending	1
himself	1
with	1
all	1
his	1
heart	1
to	1
heaven	1
and	1
to	1
his	1
Dulcinea,	1
as	1
was	1
his	1
custom	1
on	1
the	1
eve	1
of	1
any	1
combat	1
that	1
awaited	1
him,	1
proceeded	1
to	1
take	1
a	1
little	1
more	1
distance,	1
as	1
he	1
saw	1
his	1
antagonist	1
was	1
doing	1
the	1
same;	1
then,	1
without	1
blast	1
of	1
trumpet	1
or	1
other	1
warlike	1
instrument	1
to	1
give	1
them	1
the	1
signal	1
to	1
charge,	1
both	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
instant	1
wheeled	1
their	1
horses;	1
and	1
he	1
of	1
the	1
White	1
Moon,	1
being	1
the	1
swifter,	1
met	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
after	1
having	1
traversed	1
two-thirds	1
of	1
the	1
course,	1
and	1
there	1
encountered	1
him	1
with	1
such	1
violence	1
that,	1
without	1
touching	1
him	1
with	1
his	1
lance	1
(for	1
he	1
held	1
it	1
high,	1
to	1
all	1
appearance	1
purposely),	1
he	1
hurled	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
and	1
Rocinante	1
to	1
the	1
earth,	1
a	1
perilous	1
fall.	1
He	1
sprang	1
upon	1
him	1
at	1
once,	1
and	1
placing	1
the	1
lance	1
over	1
his	1
visor	1
said	1
to	1
him,	1
“You	1
are	1
vanquished,	1
sir	1
knight,	1
nay	1
dead	1
unless	1
you	1
admit	1
the	1
conditions	1
of	1
our	1
defiance.”	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
bruised	1
and	1
stupefied,	1
without	1
raising	1
his	1
visor	1
said	1
in	1
a	1
weak	1
feeble	1
voice	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
were	1
speaking	1
out	1
of	1
a	1
tomb,	1
“Dulcinea	1
del	1
Toboso	1
is	1
the	1
fairest	1
woman	1
in	1
the	1
world,	1
and	1
I	1
the	1
most	1
unfortunate	1
knight	1
on	1
earth;	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
fitting	1
that	1
this	1
truth	1
should	1
suffer	1
by	1
my	1
feebleness;	1
drive	1
your	1
lance	1
home,	1
sir	1
knight,	1
and	1
take	1
my	1
life,	1
since	1
you	1
have	1
taken	1
away	1
my	1
honour.”	1
“That	1
will	1
I	1
not,	1
in	1
sooth,”	1
said	1
he	1
of	1
the	1
White	1
Moon;	1
“live	1
the	1
fame	1
of	1
the	1
lady	1
Dulcinea’s	1
beauty	1
undimmed	1
as	1
ever;	1
all	1
I	1
require	1
is	1
that	1
the	1
great	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
retire	1
to	1
his	1
own	1
home	1
for	1
a	1
year,	1
or	1
for	1
so	1
long	1
a	1
time	1
as	1
shall	1
by	1
me	1
be	1
enjoined	1
upon	1
him,	1
as	1
we	1
agreed	1
before	1
engaging	1
in	1
this	1
combat.”	1
The	1
viceroy,	1
Don	1
Antonio,	1
and	1
several	1
others	1
who	1
were	1
present	1
heard	1
all	1
this,	1
and	1
heard	1
too	1
how	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
replied	1
that	1
so	1
long	1
as	1
nothing	1
in	1
prejudice	1
of	1
Dulcinea	1
was	1
demanded	1
of	1
him,	1
he	1
would	1
observe	1
all	1
the	1
rest	1
like	1
a	1
true	1
and	1
loyal	1
knight.	1
The	1
engagement	1
given,	1
he	1
of	1
the	1
White	1
Moon	1
wheeled	1
about,	1
and	1
making	1
obeisance	1
to	1
the	1
viceroy	1
with	1
a	1
movement	1
of	1
the	1
head,	1
rode	1
away	1
into	1
the	1
city	1
at	1
a	1
half	1
gallop.	1
The	1
viceroy	1
bade	1
Don	1
Antonio	1
hasten	1
after	1
him,	1
and	1
by	1
some	1
means	1
or	1
other	1
find	1
out	1
who	1
he	1
was.	1
They	1
raised	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
up	1
and	1
uncovered	1
his	1
face,	1
and	1
found	1
him	1
pale	1
and	1
bathed	1
with	1
sweat.	1

from	1
the	1
mere	1
hard	1
measure	1
he	1
had	1
received	1
lay	1
unable	1
to	1
stir	1
for	1
the	1
present.	1
Sancho,	1
wholly	1
dejected	1
and	1
woebegone,	1
knew	1
not	1
what	1
to	1
say	1
or	1
do.	1
He	1
fancied	1
that	1
all	1
was	1
a	1
dream,	1
that	1
the	1
whole	1
business	1
was	1
a	1
piece	1
of	1
enchantment.	1
Here	1
was	1
his	1
master	1
defeated,	1
and	1
bound	1
not	1
to	1
take	1
up	1
arms	1
for	1
a	1
year.	1
He	1
saw	1
the	1
light	1
of	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
his	1
achievements	1
obscured;	1
the	1
hopes	1
of	1
the	1
promises	1
lately	1
made	1
him	1
swept	1
away	1
like	1
smoke	1
before	1
the	1
wind;	1
Rocinante,	1
he	1
feared,	1
was	1
crippled	1
for	1
life,	1
and	1
his	1
master’s	1
bones	1
out	1
of	1
joint;	1
for	1
if	1
he	1
were	1
only	1
shaken	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
madness	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
no	1
small	1
luck.	1
In	1
the	1
end	1
they	1
carried	1
him	1
into	1
the	1
city	1
in	1
a	1
hand-chair	1
which	1
the	1
viceroy	1
sent	1

the	1

himself	1
returned,	1
eager	1

who	1
this	1
Knight	1
of	1
the	1
White	1

was	1
who	1
had	1

followed	1
the	1
Knight	1
of	1
the	1

Moon,	1
and	1
a	1
number	1
of	1
boys	1
followed	1
him	1
too,	1
nay	1
pursued	1
him,	1
until	1
they	1
had	1
him	1
fairly	1
housed	1
in	1
a	1
hostel	1
in	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
the	1
city.	1
Don	1
Antonio,	1
eager	1
to	1
make	1
his	1
acquaintance,	1
entered	1
also;	1
a	1
squire	1
came	1
out	1
to	1
meet	1
him	1
and	1
remove	1
his	1
armour,	1
and	1
he	1
shut	1
himself	1
into	1
a	1
lower	1
room,	1
still	1
attended	1
by	1
Don	1
Antonio,	1
whose	1
bread	1
would	1
not	1
bake	1
until	1
he	1
had	1
found	1
out	1
who	1
he	1
was.	1
He	1
of	1
the	1
White	1
Moon,	1
seeing	1
then	1
that	1
the	1
gentleman	1
would	1
not	1
leave	1
him,	1
said,	1
“I	1
know	1
very	1
well,	1
señor,	1
what	1
you	1
have	1
come	1
for;	1
it	1
is	1
to	1
find	1
out	1
who	1
I	1
am;	1
and	1
as	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
reason	1
why	1
I	1
should	1
conceal	1
it	1
from	1
you,	1
while	1
my	1
servant	1
here	1
is	1
taking	1
off	1
my	1
armour	1
I	1
will	1
tell	1
you	1
the	1
true	1
state	1
of	1
the	1
case,	1
without	1
leaving	1
out	1
anything.	1
You	1
must	1
know,	1
señor,	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
called	1
the	1
bachelor	1
Samson	1
Carrasco.	1
I	1
am	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
village	1
as	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
of	1
La	1
Mancha,	1
whose	1
craze	1
and	1
folly	1
make	1
all	1
of	1
us	1
who	1
know	1
him	1
feel	1
pity	1
for	1
him,	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
have	1
felt	1
it	1
most;	1
and	1
persuaded	1
that	1
his	1
chance	1
of	1
recovery	1
lay	1
in	1
quiet	1
and	1
keeping	1
at	1
home	1
and	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
house,	1
I	1
hit	1
upon	1
a	1
device	1
for	1
keeping	1
him	1
there.	1
Three	1
months	1
ago,	1
therefore,	1
I	1
went	1
out	1
to	1
meet	1
him	1
as	1
a	1
knight-errant,	1
under	1
the	1
assumed	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
Knight	1
of	1
the	1
Mirrors,	1
intending	1
to	1
engage	1
him	1
in	1
combat	1
and	1
overcome	1
him	1
without	1
hurting	1
him,	1
making	1
it	1
the	1
condition	1
of	1
our	1
combat	1
that	1
the	1
vanquished	1
should	1
be	1
at	1
the	1
disposal	1
of	1
the	1
victor.	1
What	1
I	1
meant	1
to	1
demand	1
of	1
him	1
(for	1
I	1
regarded	1
him	1
as	1
vanquished	1
already)	1
was	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
return	1
to	1
his	1
own	1
village,	1
and	1
not	1
leave	1
it	1
for	1
a	1
whole	1
year,	1
by	1
which	1
time	1
he	1
might	1
be	1
cured.	1
But	1
fate	1
ordered	1
it	1
otherwise,	1
for	1
he	1
vanquished	1
me	1
and	1
unhorsed	1
me,	1
and	1
so	1
my	1
plan	1
failed.	1
He	1
went	1
his	1
way,	1
and	1
I	1
came	1
back	1
conquered,	1
covered	1
with	1
shame,	1
and	1
sorely	1
bruised	1
by	1
my	1
fall,	1
which	1
was	1
a	1
particularly	1
dangerous	1
one.	1
But	1
this	1
did	1
not	1
quench	1
my	1
desire	1
to	1
meet	1
him	1
again	1
and	1
overcome	1
him,	1
as	1
you	1
have	1
seen	1
to-day.	1
And	1
as	1
he	1
is	1
so	1
scrupulous	1
in	1
his	1
observance	1
of	1
the	1
laws	1
of	1
knight-errantry,	1
he	1
will,	1
no	1
doubt,	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
keep	1
his	1
word,	1
obey	1
the	1
injunction	1
I	1
have	1
laid	1
upon	1
him.	1
This,	1
señor,	1
is	1
how	1
the	1
matter	1
stands,	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
nothing	1
more	1
to	1
tell	1
you.	1
I	1
implore	1
of	1
you	1
not	1
to	1
betray	1
me,	1
or	1
tell	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
who	1
I	1
am;	1
so	1
that	1
my	1
honest	1
endeavours	1
may	1
be	1
successful,	1
and	1
that	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
excellent	1
wits—were	1
he	1
only	1
rid	1
of	1
the	1
fooleries	1
of	1
chivalry—may	1
get	1
them	1
back	1
again.”	1
“O	1
señor,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Antonio,	1
“may	1
God	1
forgive	1
you	1
the	1
wrong	1
you	1
have	1
done	1
the	1
whole	1
world	1
in	1
trying	1
to	1
bring	1
the	1
most	1
amusing	1
madman	1
in	1
it	1
back	1
to	1
his	1
senses.	1
Do	1
you	1
not	1
see,	1
señor,	1
that	1
the	1
gain	1
by	1
Don	1
Quixote’s	1
sanity	1
can	1
never	1
equal	1
the	1
enjoyment	1
his	1
crazes	1
give?	1
But	1
my	1
belief	1
is	1
that	1
all	1
the	1
señor	1
bachelor’s	1
pains	1
will	1
be	1
of	1
no	1
avail	1
to	1
bring	1
a	1
man	1
so	1
hopelessly	1
cracked	1
to	1
his	1
senses	1
again;	1
and	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
not	1
uncharitable,	1
I	1
would	1
say	1
may	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
never	1
be	1
cured,	1
for	1
by	1
his	1
recovery	1
we	1
lose	1
not	1
only	1
his	1
own	1
drolleries,	1
but	1
his	1
squire	1
Sancho	1
Panza’s	1
too,	1
any	1
one	1
of	1
which	1
is	1
enough	1
to	1
turn	1
melancholy	1
itself	1
into	1
merriment.	1
However,	1
I’ll	1
hold	1
my	1
peace	1
and	1
say	1
nothing	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
we’ll	1
see	1
whether	1
I	1
am	1
right	1
in	1
my	1
suspicion	1
that	1
Señor	1
Carrasco’s	1
efforts	1
will	1
be	1
fruitless.”	1
The	1
bachelor	1
replied	1
that	1
at	1
all	1
events	1
the	1
affair	1
promised	1
well,	1
and	1
he	1
hoped	1
for	1
a	1
happy	1
result	1
from	1
it;	1
and	1
putting	1
his	1
services	1
at	1
Don	1
Antonio’s	1
commands	1
he	1
took	1
his	1
leave	1
of	1
him;	1
and	1
having	1
had	1
his	1
armour	1
packed	1
at	1
once	1
upon	1
a	1
mule,	1
he	1
rode	1
away	1
from	1
the	1
city	1
the	1
same	1
day	1
on	1
the	1
horse	1
he	1
rode	1
to	1
battle,	1
and	1
returned	1
to	1
his	1
own	1
country	1
without	1
meeting	1
any	1
adventure	1
calling	1
for	1
record	1
in	1
this	1
veracious	1
history.	1
Don	1
Antonio	1
reported	1
to	1
the	1
viceroy	1
what	1
Carrasco	1
told	1
him,	1
and	1
the	1
viceroy	1
was	1
not	1
very	1
well	1
pleased	1
to	1
hear	1
it,	1
for	1
with	1
Don	1
Quixote’s	1
retirement	1
there	1
was	1
an	1
end	1
to	1
the	1
amusement	1
of	1
all	1
who	1
knew	1
anything	1
of	1
his	1
mad	1
doings.	1
Six	1
days	1
did	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
keep	1
his	1
bed,	1
dejected,	1
melancholy,	1
moody	1
and	1
out	1
of	1
sorts,	1
brooding	1
over	1
the	1
unhappy	1
event	1
of	1
his	1
defeat.	1
Sancho	1
strove	1
to	1
comfort	1
him,	1
and	1
among	1
other	1
things	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
him,	1
“Hold	1
up	1
your	1
head,	1
señor,	1
and	1
be	1
of	1
good	1
cheer	1
if	1
you	1
can,	1
and	1
give	1
thanks	1
to	1
heaven	1
that	1
if	1
you	1
have	1
had	1
a	1
tumble	1
to	1
the	1
ground	1
you	1
have	1
not	1
come	1
off	1
with	1
a	1
broken	1
rib;	1
and,	1
as	1
you	1
know	1
that	1
‘where	1
they	1
give	1
they	1
take,’	1
and	1
that	1
‘there	1
are	1
not	1
always	1
fletches	1
where	1
there	1
are	1
pegs,’	1
a	1
fig	1
for	1
the	1
doctor,	1
for	1
there’s	1
no	1
need	1
of	1
him	1
to	1
cure	1
this	1
ailment.	1
Let	1
us	1
go	1
home,	1
and	1
give	1
over	1
going	1
about	1
in	1
search	1
of	1
adventures	1
in	1
strange	1
lands	1
and	1
places;	1
rightly	1
looked	1
at,	1
it	1
is	1
I	1
that	1
am	1
the	1
greater	1
loser,	1
though	1
it	1
is	1
your	1
worship	1
that	1
has	1
had	1
the	1
worse	1
usage.	1
With	1
the	1
government	1
I	1
gave	1
up	1
all	1
wish	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
governor	1
again,	1
but	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
give	1
up	1
all	1
longing	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
count;	1
and	1
that	1
will	1
never	1
come	1
to	1
pass	1
if	1
your	1
worship	1
gives	1
up	1
becoming	1
a	1
king	1
by	1
renouncing	1
the	1
calling	1
of	1
chivalry;	1
and	1
so	1
my	1
hopes	1
are	1
going	1
to	1
turn	1
into	1
smoke.”	1
“Peace,	1
Sancho,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
“thou	1
seest	1
my	1
suspension	1
and	1
retirement	1
is	1
not	1
to	1
exceed	1
a	1
year;	1
I	1
shall	1
soon	1
return	1
to	1
my	1
honoured	1
calling,	1
and	1
I	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
at	1
a	1
loss	1
for	1
a	1
kingdom	1
to	1
win	1
and	1
a	1
county	1
to	1
bestow	1
on	1
thee.”	1
“May	1
God	1
hear	1
it	1
and	1
sin	1
be	1
deaf,”	1
said	1
Sancho;	1
“I	1
have	1
always	1
heard	1
say	1
that	1
‘a	1
good	1
hope	1
is	1
better	1
than	1
a	1
bad	1
holding.”	1
As	1
they	1
were	1
talking	1
Don	1
Antonio	1
came	1
in	1
looking	1
extremely	1
pleased	1
and	1
exclaiming,	1
“Reward	1
me	1
for	1
my	1
good	1
news,	1
Señor	1
Don	1
Quixote!	1
Don	1
Gregorio	1
and	1
the	1
renegade	1
who	1
went	1
for	1
him	1
have	1
come	1
ashore—ashore	1
do	1
I	1
say?	1
They	1
are	1
by	1
this	1
time	1
in	1
the	1
viceroy’s	1
house,	1
and	1
will	1
be	1
here	1
immediately.”	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
cheered	1
up	1
a	1
little	1
and	1
said,	1
“Of	1
a	1
truth	1
I	1
am	1
almost	1
ready	1
to	1
say	1
I	1
should	1
have	1
been	1
glad	1
had	1
it	1
turned	1
out	1
just	1
the	1
other	1
way,	1
for	1
it	1
would	1
have	1
obliged	1
me	1
to	1
cross	1
over	1
to	1
Barbary,	1
where	1
by	1
the	1
might	1
of	1
my	1
arm	1
I	1
should	1
have	1
restored	1
to	1
liberty,	1
not	1
only	1
Don	1
Gregorio,	1
but	1
all	1
the	1
Christian	1
captives	1
there	1
are	1
in	1
Barbary.	1
But	1
what	1
am	1
I	1
saying,	1
miserable	1
being	1
that	1
I	1
am?	1
Am	1
I	1
not	1
he	1
that	1
has	1
been	1
conquered?	1
Am	1
I	1
not	1
he	1
that	1
has	1
been	1
overthrown?	1
Am	1
I	1
not	1
he	1
who	1
must	1
not	1
take	1
up	1
arms	1
for	1
a	1
year?	1
Then	1
what	1
am	1
I	1
making	1
professions	1
for;	1
what	1
am	1
I	1
bragging	1
about;	1
when	1
it	1
is	1
fitter	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
handle	1
the	1
distaff	1
than	1
the	1
sword?”	1
“No	1
more	1
of	1
that,	1
señor,”	1
said	1
Sancho;	1
“‘let	1
the	1
hen	1
live,	1
even	1
though	1
it	1
be	1
with	1
her	1
pip;’	1
‘to-day	1
for	1
thee	1
and	1
to-morrow	1
for	1
me;’	1
in	1
these	1
affairs	1
of	1
encounters	1
and	1
whacks	1
one	1
must	1
not	1
mind	1
them,	1
for	1
he	1
that	1
falls	1
to-day	1
may	1
get	1
up	1
to-morrow;	1
unless	1
indeed	1
he	1
chooses	1
to	1
lie	1
in	1
bed,	1
I	1
mean	1
gives	1
way	1
to	1
weakness	1
and	1
does	1
not	1
pluck	1
up	1
fresh	1
spirit	1
for	1
fresh	1
battles;	1
let	1
your	1
worship	1
get	1
up	1
now	1
to	1
receive	1
Don	1
Gregorio;	1
for	1
the	1
household	1
seems	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
a	1
bustle,	1
and	1
no	1
doubt	1
he	1
has	1
come	1
by	1
this	1
time;”	1
and	1
so	1
it	1
proved,	1
for	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
Don	1
Gregorio	1
and	1
the	1
renegade	1
had	1
given	1
the	1
viceroy	1
an	1
account	1
of	1
the	1
voyage	1
out	1
and	1
home,	1
Don	1
Gregorio,	1
eager	1
to	1
see	1
Ana	1
Felix,	1
came	1
with	1
the	1
renegade	1
to	1
Don	1
Antonio’s	1
house.	1
When	1
they	1
carried	1
him	1
away	1
from	1
Algiers	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
woman’s	1
dress;	1
on	1
board	1
the	1
vessel,	1
however,	1
he	1
exchanged	1
it	1
for	1
that	1
of	1
a	1
captive	1
who	1
escaped	1
with	1
him;	1
but	1
in	1
whatever	1
dress	1
he	1
might	1
be	1
he	1
looked	1
like	1
one	1
to	1
be	1
loved	1
and	1
served	1
and	1
esteemed,	1
for	1
he	1
was	1
surpassingly	1
well-favoured,	1
and	1
to	1
judge	1
by	1
appearances	1
some	1
seventeen	1
or	1
eighteen	1
years	1
of	1
age.	1
Ricote	1
and	1
his	1
daughter	1
came	1
out	1
to	1
welcome	1
him,	1
the	1
father	1
with	1
tears,	1
the	1
daughter	1
with	1
bashfulness.	1
They	1
did	1
not	1
embrace	1
each	1
other,	1
for	1
where	1
there	1
is	1
deep	1
love	1
there	1
will	1
never	1
be	1
overmuch	1
boldness.	1
Seen	1
side	1
by	1
side,	1
the	1
comeliness	1
of	1
Don	1
Gregorio	1
and	1
the	1
beauty	1
of	1
Ana	1
Felix	1
were	1
the	1
admiration	1
of	1
all	1
who	1
were	1
present.	1
It	1
was	1
silence	1
that	1
spoke	1
for	1
the	1
lovers	1
at	1
that	1
moment,	1
and	1
their	1
eyes	1
were	1
the	1
tongues	1
that	1
declared	1
their	1
pure	1
and	1
happy	1
feelings.	1
The	1
renegade	1
explained	1
the	1
measures	1
and	1
means	1
he	1
had	1
adopted	1
to	1
rescue	1
Don	1
Gregorio,	1
and	1
Don	1
Gregorio	1
at	1
no	1
great	1
length,	1
but	1
in	1
a	1
few	1
words,	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
showed	1
that	1
his	1
intelligence	1
was	1
in	1
advance	1
of	1
his	1
years,	1
described	1
the	1
peril	1
and	1
embarrassment	1
he	1
found	1
himself	1
in	1
among	1
the	1
women	1
with	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
sojourned.	1
To	1
conclude,	1
Ricote	1
liberally	1
recompensed	1
and	1
rewarded	1
as	1
well	1
the	1
renegade	1
as	1
the	1
men	1
who	1
had	1
rowed;	1
and	1
the	1
renegade	1
effected	1
his	1
readmission	1
into	1
the	1
body	1
of	1
the	1
Church	1
and	1
was	1
reconciled	1
with	1
it,	1
and	1
from	1
a	1
rotten	1
limb	1
became	1
by	1
penance	1
and	1
repentance	1
a	1
clean	1
and	1
sound	1
one.	1
Two	1
days	1
later	1
the	1
viceroy	1
discussed	1
with	1
Don	1
Antonio	1
the	1
steps	1
they	1
should	1
take	1
to	1
enable	1
Ana	1
Felix	1
and	1
her	1
father	1
to	1
stay	1
in	1
Spain,	1
for	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
them	1
there	1
could	1
be	1
no	1
objection	1
to	1
a	1
daughter	1
who	1
was	1
so	1
good	1
a	1
Christian	1
and	1
a	1
father	1
to	1
all	1
appearance	1
so	1
well	1
disposed	1
remaining	1
there.	1
Don	1
Antonio	1
offered	1
to	1
arrange	1
the	1
matter	1
at	1
the	1
capital,	1
whither	1
he	1
was	1
compelled	1
to	1
go	1
on	1
some	1
other	1
business,	1
hinting	1
that	1
many	1
a	1
difficult	1
affair	1
was	1
settled	1
there	1
with	1
the	1
help	1
of	1
favour	1
and	1
bribes.	1
“Nay,”	1
said	1
Ricote,	1
who	1
was	1
present	1
during	1
the	1
conversation,	1
“it	1
will	1
not	1
do	1
to	1
rely	1
upon	1
favour	1
or	1
bribes,	1
because	1
with	1
the	1
great	1
Don	1
Bernardino	1
de	1
Velasco,	1
Conde	1
de	1
Salazar,	1
to	1
whom	1
his	1
Majesty	1
has	1
entrusted	1
our	1
expulsion,	1
neither	1
entreaties	1
nor	1
promises,	1
bribes	1
nor	1
appeals	1
to	1
compassion,	1
are	1
of	1
any	1
use;	1
for	1
though	1
it	1
is	1
true	1
he	1
mingles	1
mercy	1
with	1
justice,	1
still,	1
seeing	1
that	1
the	1
whole	1
body	1
of	1
our	1
nation	1
is	1
tainted	1
and	1
corrupt,	1
he	1
applies	1
to	1
it	1
the	1
cautery	1
that	1
burns	1
rather	1
than	1
the	1
salve	1
that	1
soothes;	1
and	1
thus,	1
by	1
prudence,	1
sagacity,	1
care	1
and	1
the	1
fear	1
he	1
inspires,	1
he	1
has	1
borne	1
on	1
his	1
mighty	1
shoulders	1
the	1
weight	1
of	1
this	1
great	1
policy	1
and	1
carried	1
it	1
into	1
effect,	1
all	1
our	1
schemes	1
and	1
plots,	1
importunities	1
and	1
wiles,	1
being	1
ineffectual	1
to	1
blind	1
his	1
Argus	1
eyes,	1
ever	1
on	1
the	1
watch	1
lest	1
one	1
of	1
us	1
should	1
remain	1
behind	1
in	1
concealment,	1
and	1
like	1
a	1
hidden	1
root	1
come	1
in	1
course	1
of	1
time	1
to	1
sprout	1
and	1
bear	1
poisonous	1
fruit	1
in	1
Spain,	1
now	1
cleansed,	1
and	1
relieved	1
of	1
the	1
fear	1
in	1
which	1
our	1
vast	1
numbers	1
kept	1
it.	1
Heroic	1
resolve	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
Philip	1
the	1
Third,	1
and	1
unparalleled	1
wisdom	1
to	1
have	1
entrusted	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
said	1
Don	1
Bernardino	1
de	1
Velasco!”	1
“At	1
any	1
rate,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Antonio,	1
“when	1
I	1
am	1
there	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
all	1
possible	1
efforts,	1
and	1
let	1
heaven	1
do	1
as	1
pleases	1
it	1
best;	1
Don	1
Gregorio	1
will	1
come	1
with	1
me	1
to	1
relieve	1
the	1
anxiety	1
which	1
his	1
parents	1
must	1
be	1
suffering	1
on	1
account	1
of	1
his	1
absence;	1
Ana	1
Felix	1
will	1
remain	1
in	1
my	1
house	1
with	1
my	1
wife,	1
or	1
in	1
a	1
monastery;	1
and	1
I	1
know	1
the	1
viceroy	1
will	1
be	1
glad	1
that	1
the	1
worthy	1
Ricote	1
should	1
stay	1
with	1
him	1
until	1
we	1
see	1
what	1
terms	1
I	1
can	1
make.”	1
The	1
viceroy	1
agreed	1
to	1
all	1
that	1
was	1
proposed;	1
but	1
Don	1
Gregorio	1
on	1
learning	1
what	1
had	1
passed	1
declared	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
and	1
would	1
not	1
on	1
any	1
account	1
leave	1
Ana	1
Felix;	1
however,	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
his	1
purpose	1
to	1
go	1
and	1
see	1
his	1
parents	1
and	1
devise	1
some	1
way	1
of	1
returning	1
for	1
her,	1
he	1
fell	1
in	1
with	1
the	1
proposed	1
arrangement.	1
Ana	1
Felix	1
remained	1
with	1
Don	1
Antonio’s	1
wife,	1
and	1
Ricote	1
in	1
the	1
viceroy’s	1
house.	1
The	1
day	1
for	1
Don	1
Antonio’s	1
departure	1
came;	1
and	1
two	1
days	1
later	1
that	1
for	1
Don	1
Quixote’s	1
and	1
Sancho’s,	1
for	1
Don	1
Quixote’s	1
fall	1
did	1
not	1
suffer	1
him	1
to	1
take	1
the	1
road	1
sooner.	1
There	1
were	1
tears	1
and	1
sighs,	1
swoonings	1
and	1
sobs,	1
at	1
the	1
parting	1
between	1
Don	1
Gregorio	1
and	1
Ana	1
Felix.	1
Ricote	1
offered	1
Don	1
Gregorio	1
a	1
thousand	1
crowns	1
if	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
them,	1
but	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
take	1
any	1
save	1
five	1
which	1
Don	1
Antonio	1
lent	1
him	1
and	1
he	1
promised	1
to	1
repay	1
at	1
the	1
capital.	1
So	1
the	1
two	1
of	1
them	1
took	1
their	1
departure,	1
and	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
and	1
Sancho	1
afterwards,	1
as	1
has	1
been	1
already	1
said,	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
without	1
his	1
armour	1
and	1
in	1
travelling	1
gear,	1
and	1
Sancho	1
on	1
foot,	1
Dapple	1
being	1
loaded	1
with	1
the	1
armour.	1

As	1
he	1
left	1
Barcelona,	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
turned	1
gaze	1
upon	1
the	1
spot	1
where	1
he	1
had	1
fallen.	1
“Here	1
Troy	1
was,”	1
said	1
he;	1
“here	1
my	1
ill-luck,	1
not	1
my	1
cowardice,	1
robbed	1
me	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
glory	1
I	1
had	1
won;	1
here	1
Fortune	1
made	1
me	1
the	1
victim	1
of	1
her	1
caprices;	1
here	1
the	1
lustre	1
of	1
my	1
achievements	1
was	1
dimmed;	1
here,	1
in	1
a	1
word,	1
fell	1
my	1
happiness	1
never	1
to	1
rise	1
again.”	1

“Señor,”	1
said	1
Sancho	1
on	1
hearing	1
this,	1
“it	1
is	1
the	1
part	1
of	1
brave	1
hearts	1
to	1
be	1
patient	1
in	1
adversity	1
just	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
to	1
be	1
glad	1
in	1
prosperity;	1
I	1
judge	1
by	1
myself,	1
for,	1
if	1
when	1
I	1
was	1
a	1
governor	1
I	1
was	1
glad,	1
now	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
squire	1
and	1
on	1
foot	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
sad;	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
heard	1
say	1
that	1
she	1
whom	1
commonly	1
they	1
call	1
Fortune	1
is	1
a	1
drunken	1
whimsical	1
jade,	1
and,	1
what	1
is	1
more,	1
blind,	1
and	1
therefore	1
neither	1
sees	1
what	1
she	1
does,	1
nor	1
knows	1
whom	1
she	1
casts	1
down	1
or	1
whom	1
she	1
sets	1
up.”	1
“Thou	1
art	1
a	1
great	1
philosopher,	1
Sancho,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
“thou	1
speakest	1
very	1
sensibly;	1
I	1
know	1
not	1
who	1
taught	1
thee.	1
But	1
I	1
can	1
tell	1
thee	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
such	1
thing	1
as	1
Fortune	1
in	1
the	1
world,	1
nor	1
does	1
anything	1
which	1
takes	1
place	1
there,	1
be	1
it	1
good	1
or	1
bad,	1
come	1
about	1
by	1
chance,	1
but	1
by	1
the	1
special	1
preordination	1
of	1
heaven;	1
and	1
hence	1
the	1
common	1
saying	1
that	1
‘each	1
of	1
us	1
is	1
the	1
maker	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
Fortune.’	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
that	1
of	1
mine;	1
but	1
not	1
with	1
the	1
proper	1
amount	1
of	1
prudence,	1
and	1
my	1
self-confidence	1
has	1
therefore	1
made	1
me	1
pay	1
dearly;	1
for	1
I	1
ought	1
to	1
have	1
reflected	1
that	1
Rocinante’s	1
feeble	1
strength	1
could	1
not	1
resist	1
the	1
mighty	1
bulk	1
of	1
the	1
Knight	1
of	1
the	1
White	1
Moon’s	1
horse.	1
In	1
a	1
word,	1
I	1
ventured	1
it,	1
I	1
did	1
my	1
best,	1
I	1
was	1
overthrown,	1
but	1
though	1
I	1
lost	1
my	1
honour	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
lose	1
nor	1
can	1
I	1
lose	1
the	1
virtue	1
of	1
keeping	1
my	1
word.	1
When	1
I	1
was	1
a	1
knight-errant,	1
daring	1
and	1
valiant,	1
I	1
supported	1
my	1
achievements	1
by	1
hand	1
and	1
deed,	1
and	1
now	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
a	1
humble	1
squire	1
I	1
will	1
support	1
my	1
words	1
by	1
keeping	1
the	1
promise	1
I	1
have	1
given.	1
Forward	1
then,	1
Sancho	1
my	1
friend,	1
let	1
us	1
go	1
to	1
keep	1
the	1
year	1
of	1
the	1
novitiate	1
in	1
our	1
own	1
country,	1
and	1
in	1
that	1
seclusion	1
we	1
shall	1
pick	1
up	1
fresh	1
strength	1
to	1
return	1
to	1
the	1
by	1
me	1
never-forgotten	1
calling	1
of	1
arms.”	1
“Señor,”	1
returned	1
Sancho,	1
“travelling	1
on	1
foot	1
is	1
not	1
such	1
a	1
pleasant	1
thing	1
that	1
it	1
makes	1
me	1
feel	1
disposed	1
or	1
tempted	1
to	1
make	1
long	1
marches.	1
Let	1
us	1
leave	1
this	1
armour	1
hung	1
up	1
on	1
some	1
tree,	1
instead	1
of	1
someone	1
that	1
has	1
been	1
hanged;	1
and	1
then	1
with	1
me	1
on	1
Dapple’s	1
back	1
and	1
my	1
feet	1
off	1
the	1
ground	1
we	1
will	1
arrange	1
the	1
stages	1
as	1
your	1
worship	1
pleases	1
to	1
measure	1
them	1
out;	1
but	1
to	1
suppose	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
going	1
to	1
travel	1
on	1
foot,	1
and	1
make	1
long	1
ones,	1
is	1
to	1
suppose	1
nonsense.”	1
“Thou	1
sayest	1
well,	1
Sancho,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
“let	1
my	1
armour	1
be	1
hung	1
up	1
for	1
a	1
trophy,	1
and	1
under	1
it	1
or	1
round	1
it	1
we	1
will	1
carve	1
on	1
the	1
trees	1
what	1
was	1
inscribed	1
on	1
the	1
trophy	1
of	1
Roland’s	1
armour-	1
These	1
let	1
none	1
move	1
Who	1
dareth	1
not	1
his	1
might	1
with	1
Roland	1
prove.”	1
“That’s	1
the	1
very	1
thing,”	1
said	1
Sancho;	1
“and	1
if	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
that	1
we	1
should	1
feel	1
the	1
want	1
of	1
Rocinante	1
on	1
the	1
road,	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
as	1
well	1
to	1
leave	1
him	1
hung	1
up	1
too.”	1
“And	1
yet,	1
I	1
had	1
rather	1
not	1
have	1
either	1
him	1
or	1
the	1
armour	1
hung	1
up,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“that	1
it	1
may	1
not	1
be	1
said,	1
‘for	1
good	1
service	1
a	1
bad	1
return.’”	1
“Your	1
worship	1
is	1
right,”	1
said	1
Sancho;	1
“for,	1
as	1
sensible	1
people	1
hold,	1
‘the	1
fault	1
of	1
the	1
ass	1
must	1
not	1
be	1
laid	1
on	1
the	1
pack-saddle;’	1
and,	1
as	1
in	1
this	1
affair	1
the	1
fault	1
is	1
your	1
worship’s,	1
punish	1
yourself	1
and	1
don’t	1
let	1
your	1
anger	1
break	1
out	1
against	1
the	1
already	1
battered	1
and	1
bloody	1
armour,	1
or	1
the	1
meekness	1
of	1
Rocinante,	1
or	1
the	1
tenderness	1
of	1
my	1
feet,	1
trying	1
to	1
make	1
them	1
travel	1
more	1
than	1
is	1
reasonable.”	1

In	1
converse	1
of	1
this	1
sort	1
the	1
whole	1
of	1
that	1
day	1
went	1
by,	1
as	1
did	1
the	1
four	1
succeeding	1
ones,	1
without	1
anything	1
occurring	1
to	1
interrupt	1
their	1
journey,	1
but	1
on	1
the	1
fifth	1
as	1
they	1
entered	1
a	1
village	1
they	1
found	1
a	1
great	1
number	1
of	1
people	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
an	1
inn	1
enjoying	1
themselves,	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
holiday.	1
Upon	1
Don	1
Quixote’s	1
approach	1
a	1
peasant	1
called	1
out,	1
“One	1
of	1
these	1
two	1
gentlemen	1
who	1
come	1
here,	1
and	1
who	1
don’t	1
know	1
the	1
parties,	1
will	1
tell	1
us	1
what	1
we	1
ought	1
to	1
do	1
about	1
our	1
wager.”	1
“That	1
I	1
will,	1
certainly,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“and	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
rights	1
of	1
the	1
case,	1
if	1
I	1
can	1
manage	1
to	1
understand	1
it.”	1
“Well,	1
here	1
it	1
is,	1
worthy	1
sir,”	1
said	1
the	1
peasant;	1
“a	1
man	1
of	1
this	1
village	1
who	1
is	1
so	1
fat	1
that	1
he	1
weighs	1
twenty	1
stone	1
challenged	1
another,	1
a	1
neighbour	1
of	1
his,	1
who	1
does	1
not	1
weigh	1
more	1
than	1
nine,	1
to	1
run	1
a	1
race.	1
The	1
agreement	1
was	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
to	1
run	1
a	1
distance	1
of	1
a	1
hundred	1
paces	1
with	1
equal	1
weights;	1
and	1
when	1
the	1
challenger	1
was	1
asked	1
how	1
the	1
weights	1
were	1
to	1
be	1
equalised	1
he	1
said	1
that	1
the	1
other,	1
as	1
he	1
weighed	1
nine	1
stone,	1
should	1
put	1
eleven	1
in	1
iron	1
on	1
his	1
back,	1
and	1
that	1
in	1
this	1
way	1
the	1
twenty	1
stone	1
of	1
the	1
thin	1
man	1
would	1
equal	1
the	1
twenty	1
stone	1
of	1
the	1
fat	1
one.”	1
“Not	1
at	1
all,”	1
exclaimed	1
Sancho	1
at	1
once,	1
before	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
could	1
answer;	1
“it’s	1
for	1
me,	1
that	1
only	1
a	1
few	1
days	1
ago	1
left	1
off	1
being	1
a	1
governor	1
and	1
a	1
judge,	1
as	1
all	1
the	1
world	1
knows,	1
to	1
settle	1
these	1
doubtful	1
questions	1
and	1
give	1
an	1
opinion	1
in	1
disputes	1
of	1
all	1
sorts.”	1
“Answer	1
in	1
God’s	1
name,	1
Sancho	1
my	1
friend,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“for	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
fit	1
to	1
give	1
crumbs	1
to	1
a	1
cat,	1
my	1
wits	1
are	1
so	1
confused	1
and	1
upset.”	1
With	1
this	1
permission	1
Sancho	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
peasants	1
who	1
stood	1
clustered	1
round	1
him,	1
waiting	1
with	1
open	1
mouths	1
for	1
the	1
decision	1
to	1
come	1
from	1
his,	1
“Brothers,	1
what	1
the	1
fat	1
man	1
requires	1
is	1
not	1
in	1
reason,	1
nor	1
has	1
it	1
a	1
shadow	1
of	1
justice	1
in	1
it;	1
because,	1
if	1
it	1
be	1
true,	1
as	1
they	1
say,	1
that	1
the	1
challenged	1
may	1
choose	1
the	1
weapons,	1
the	1
other	1
has	1
no	1
right	1
to	1
choose	1
such	1
as	1
will	1
prevent	1
and	1
keep	1
him	1
from	1
winning.	1
My	1
decision,	1
therefore,	1
is	1
that	1
the	1
fat	1
challenger	1
prune,	1
peel,	1
thin,	1
trim	1
and	1
correct	1
himself,	1
and	1
take	1
eleven	1
stone	1
of	1
his	1
flesh	1
off	1
his	1
body,	1
here	1
or	1
there,	1
as	1
he	1
pleases,	1
and	1
as	1
suits	1
him	1
best;	1
and	1
being	1
in	1
this	1
way	1
reduced	1
to	1
nine	1
stone	1
weight,	1
he	1
will	1
make	1
himself	1
equal	1
and	1
even	1
with	1
nine	1
stone	1
of	1
his	1
opponent,	1
and	1
they	1
will	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
run	1
on	1
equal	1
terms.”	1
“By	1
all	1
that’s	1
good,”	1
said	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
peasants	1
as	1
he	1
heard	1
Sancho’s	1
decision,	1
“but	1
the	1
gentleman	1
has	1
spoken	1
like	1
a	1
saint,	1
and	1
given	1
judgment	1
like	1
a	1
canon!	1
But	1
I’ll	1
be	1
bound	1
the	1
fat	1
man	1
won’t	1
part	1
with	1
an	1
ounce	1
of	1
his	1
flesh,	1
not	1
to	1
say	1
eleven	1
stone.”	1
“The	1
best	1
plan	1
will	1
be	1
for	1
them	1
not	1
to	1
run,”	1
said	1
another,	1
“so	1
that	1
neither	1
the	1
thin	1
man	1
break	1
down	1
under	1
the	1
weight,	1
nor	1
the	1
fat	1
one	1
strip	1
himself	1
of	1
his	1
flesh;	1
let	1
half	1
the	1
wager	1
be	1
spent	1
in	1
wine,	1
and	1
let’s	1
take	1
these	1
gentlemen	1
to	1
the	1
tavern	1
where	1
there’s	1
the	1
best,	1
and	1
‘over	1
me	1
be	1
the	1
cloak	1
when	1
it	1
rains.”	1
“I	1
thank	1
you,	1
sirs,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
“but	1
I	1
cannot	1
stop	1
for	1
an	1
instant,	1
for	1
sad	1
thoughts	1
and	1
unhappy	1
circumstances	1
force	1
me	1
to	1
seem	1
discourteous	1
and	1
to	1
travel	1
apace;”	1
and	1
spurring	1
Rocinante	1
he	1
pushed	1
on,	1
leaving	1
them	1
wondering	1
at	1
what	1
they	1
had	1
seen	1
and	1
heard,	1
at	1
his	1
own	1
strange	1
figure	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
shrewdness	1
of	1
his	1
servant,	1
for	1
such	1
they	1
took	1
Sancho	1
to	1
be;	1
and	1
another	1
of	1
them	1
observed,	1
“If	1
the	1
servant	1
is	1
so	1
clever,	1
what	1
must	1
the	1
master	1
be?	1
I’ll	1
bet,	1
if	1
they	1
are	1
going	1
to	1
Salamanca	1
to	1
study,	1
they’ll	1
come	1
to	1
be	1
alcaldes	1
of	1
the	1
Court	1
in	1
a	1
trice;	1
for	1
it’s	1
a	1
mere	1
joke—only	1
to	1
read	1
and	1
read,	1
and	1
have	1
interest	1
and	1
good	1
luck;	1
and	1
before	1
a	1
man	1
knows	1
where	1
he	1
is	1
he	1
finds	1
himself	1
with	1
a	1
staff	1
in	1
his	1
hand	1
or	1
a	1
mitre	1
on	1
his	1
head.”	1
That	1
night	1
master	1
and	1
man	1
passed	1
out	1
in	1
the	1
fields	1
in	1
the	1
open	1
air,	1
and	1
the	1
next	1
day	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
pursuing	1
their	1
journey	1
they	1
saw	1
coming	1
towards	1
them	1
a	1
man	1
on	1
foot	1
with	1
alforjas	1
at	1
the	1
neck	1
and	1
a	1
javelin	1
or	1
spiked	1
staff	1
in	1
his	1
hand,	1
the	1
very	1
cut	1
of	1
a	1
foot	1
courier;	1
who,	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
came	1
close	1
to	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
increased	1
his	1
pace	1
and	1
half	1
running	1
came	1
up	1
to	1
him,	1
and	1
embracing	1
his	1
right	1
thigh,	1
for	1
he	1
could	1
reach	1
no	1
higher,	1
exclaimed	1
with	1
evident	1
pleasure,	1
“O	1
Señor	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
of	1
La	1
Mancha,	1
what	1
happiness	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
to	1
the	1
heart	1
of	1
my	1
lord	1
the	1
duke	1
when	1
he	1
knows	1
your	1
worship	1
is	1
coming	1
back	1
to	1
his	1
castle,	1
for	1
he	1
is	1
still	1
there	1
with	1
my	1
lady	1
the	1
duchess!”	1
“I	1
do	1
not	1
recognise	1
you,	1
friend,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“nor	1
do	1
I	1
know	1
who	1
you	1
are,	1
unless	1
you	1
tell	1
me.”	1
“I	1
am	1
Tosilos,	1
my	1
lord	1
the	1
duke’s	1
lacquey,	1
Señor	1
Don	1
Quixote,”	1
replied	1
the	1
courier;	1
“he	1
who	1
refused	1
to	1
fight	1
your	1
worship	1
about	1
marrying	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
Doña	1
Rodriguez.”	1
“God	1
bless	1
me!”	1
exclaimed	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
“is	1
it	1
possible	1
that	1
you	1
are	1
the	1
one	1
whom	1
mine	1
enemies	1
the	1
enchanters	1
changed	1
into	1
the	1
lacquey	1
you	1
speak	1
of	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
rob	1
me	1
of	1
the	1
honour	1
of	1
that	1
battle?”	1
“Nonsense,	1
good	1
sir!”	1
said	1
the	1
messenger;	1
“there	1
was	1
no	1
enchantment	1
or	1
transformation	1
at	1
all;	1
I	1
entered	1
the	1
lists	1
just	1
as	1
much	1
lacquey	1
Tosilos	1
as	1
I	1
came	1
out	1
of	1
them	1
lacquey	1
Tosilos.	1
I	1
thought	1
to	1
marry	1
without	1
fighting,	1
for	1
the	1
girl	1
had	1
taken	1
my	1
fancy;	1
but	1
my	1
scheme	1
had	1
a	1
very	1
different	1
result,	1
for	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
your	1
worship	1
had	1
left	1
the	1
castle	1
my	1
lord	1
the	1
duke	1
had	1
a	1
hundred	1
strokes	1
of	1
the	1
stick	1
given	1
me	1
for	1
having	1
acted	1
contrary	1
to	1
the	1
orders	1
he	1
gave	1
me	1
before	1
engaging	1
in	1
the	1
combat;	1
and	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
affair	1
is	1
that	1
the	1
girl	1
has	1
become	1
a	1
nun,	1
and	1
Doña	1
Rodriguez	1
has	1
gone	1
back	1
to	1
Castile,	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
now	1
on	1
my	1
way	1
to	1
Barcelona	1
with	1
a	1
packet	1
of	1
letters	1
for	1
the	1
viceroy	1
which	1
my	1
master	1
is	1
sending	1
him.	1
If	1
your	1
worship	1
would	1
like	1
a	1
drop,	1
sound	1
though	1
warm,	1
I	1
have	1
a	1
gourd	1
here	1
full	1
of	1
the	1
best,	1
and	1
some	1
scraps	1
of	1
Tronchon	1
cheese	1
that	1
will	1
serve	1
as	1
a	1
provocative	1
and	1
wakener	1
of	1
your	1
thirst	1
if	1
so	1
be	1
it	1
is	1
asleep.”	1
“I	1
take	1
the	1
offer,”	1
said	1
Sancho;	1
“no	1
more	1
compliments	1
about	1
it;	1
pour	1
out,	1
good	1
Tosilos,	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
enchanters	1
in	1
the	1
Indies.”	1
“Thou	1
art	1
indeed	1
the	1
greatest	1
glutton	1
in	1
the	1
world,	1
Sancho,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“and	1
the	1
greatest	1
booby	1
on	1
earth,	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
see	1
that	1
this	1
courier	1
is	1
enchanted	1
and	1
this	1
Tosilos	1
a	1
sham	1
one;	1
stop	1
with	1
him	1
and	1
take	1
thy	1
fill;	1
I	1
will	1
go	1
on	1
slowly	1
and	1
wait	1
for	1
thee	1
to	1
come	1
up	1
with	1
me.”	1
The	1
lacquey	1
laughed,	1
unsheathed	1
his	1
gourd,	1
unwalletted	1
his	1
scraps,	1
and	1
taking	1
out	1
a	1
small	1
loaf	1
of	1
bread	1
he	1
and	1
Sancho	1
seated	1
themselves	1
on	1
the	1
green	1
grass,	1
and	1
in	1
peace	1
and	1
good	1
fellowship	1
finished	1
off	1
the	1
contents	1
of	1
the	1
alforjas	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
bottom,	1
so	1
resolutely	1
that	1
they	1
licked	1
the	1
wrapper	1
of	1
the	1
letters,	1
merely	1
because	1
it	1
smelt	1
of	1
cheese.	1
Said	1
Tosilos	1
to	1
Sancho,	1
“Beyond	1
a	1
doubt,	1
Sancho	1
my	1
friend,	1
this	1
master	1
of	1
thine	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
madman.”	1
“Ought!”	1
said	1
Sancho;	1
“he	1
owes	1
no	1
man	1
anything;	1
he	1
pays	1
for	1
everything,	1
particularly	1
when	1
the	1
coin	1
is	1
madness.	1
I	1
see	1
it	1
plain	1
enough,	1
and	1
I	1
tell	1
him	1
so	1
plain	1
enough;	1
but	1
what’s	1
the	1
use?	1
especially	1
now	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
all	1
over	1
with	1
him,	1
for	1
here	1
he	1
is	1
beaten	1
by	1
the	1
Knight	1
of	1
the	1
White	1
Moon.”	1
Tosilos	1
begged	1
him	1
to	1
explain	1
what	1
had	1
happened	1
him,	1
but	1
Sancho	1
replied	1
that	1
it	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
good	1
manners	1
to	1
leave	1
his	1
master	1
waiting	1
for	1
him;	1
and	1
that	1
some	1
other	1
day	1
if	1
they	1
met	1
there	1
would	1
be	1
time	1
enough	1
for	1
that;	1
and	1
then	1
getting	1
up,	1
after	1
shaking	1
his	1
doublet	1
and	1
brushing	1
the	1
crumbs	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
beard,	1
he	1
drove	1
Dapple	1
on	1
before	1
him,	1
and	1
bidding	1
adieu	1
to	1
Tosilos	1
left	1
him	1
and	1
rejoined	1
his	1
master,	1
who	1
was	1
waiting	1
for	1
him	1
under	1
the	1
shade	1
of	1
a	1
tree.	1

If	1
a	1
multitude	1
of	1
reflections	1
used	1
to	1
harass	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
before	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
overthrown,	1
a	1
great	1
many	1
more	1
harassed	1
him	1
since	1
his	1
fall.	1
He	1
was	1
under	1
the	1
shade	1
of	1
a	1
tree,	1
as	1
has	1
been	1
said,	1
and	1
there,	1
like	1
flies	1
on	1
honey,	1
thoughts	1
came	1
crowding	1
upon	1
him	1
and	1
stinging	1
him.	1
Some	1
of	1
them	1
turned	1
upon	1
the	1
disenchantment	1
of	1
Dulcinea,	1
others	1
upon	1
the	1
life	1
he	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
lead	1
in	1
his	1
enforced	1
retirement.	1
Sancho	1
came	1
up	1
and	1
spoke	1
in	1
high	1
praise	1
of	1
the	1
generous	1
disposition	1
of	1
the	1
lacquey	1
Tosilos.	1
“Is	1
it	1
possible,	1
Sancho,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“that	1
thou	1
dost	1
still	1
think	1
that	1
he	1
yonder	1
is	1
a	1
real	1
lacquey?	1
Apparently	1
it	1
has	1
escaped	1
thy	1
memory	1
that	1
thou	1
hast	1
seen	1
Dulcinea	1
turned	1
and	1
transformed	1
into	1
a	1
peasant	1
wench,	1
and	1
the	1
Knight	1
of	1
the	1
Mirrors	1
into	1
the	1
bachelor	1
Carrasco;	1
all	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
the	1
enchanters	1
that	1
persecute	1
me.	1
But	1
tell	1
me	1
now,	1
didst	1
thou	1
ask	1
this	1
Tosilos,	1
as	1
thou	1
callest	1
him,	1
what	1
has	1
become	1
of	1
Altisidora,	1
did	1
she	1
weep	1
over	1
my	1
absence,	1
or	1
has	1
she	1
already	1
consigned	1
to	1
oblivion	1
the	1
love	1
thoughts	1
that	1
used	1
to	1
afflict	1
her	1
when	1
I	1
was	1
present?”	1
“The	1
thoughts	1
that	1
I	1
had,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“were	1
not	1
such	1
as	1
to	1
leave	1
time	1
for	1
asking	1
fool’s	1
questions.	1
Body	1
o’	1
me,	1
señor!	1
is	1
your	1
worship	1
in	1
a	1
condition	1
now	1
to	1
inquire	1
into	1
other	1
people’s	1
thoughts,	1
above	1
all	1
love	1
thoughts?”	1
“Look	1
ye,	1
Sancho,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“there	1
is	1
a	1
great	1
difference	1
between	1
what	1
is	1
done	1
out	1
of	1
love	1
and	1
what	1
is	1
done	1
out	1
of	1
gratitude.	1
A	1
knight	1
may	1
very	1
possibly	1
be	1
proof	1
against	1
love;	1
but	1
it	1
is	1
impossible,	1
strictly	1
speaking,	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
ungrateful.	1
Altisidora,	1
to	1
all	1
appearance,	1
loved	1
me	1
truly;	1
she	1
gave	1
me	1
the	1
three	1
kerchiefs	1
thou	1
knowest	1
of;	1
she	1
wept	1
at	1
my	1
departure,	1
she	1
cursed	1
me,	1
she	1
abused	1
me,	1
casting	1
shame	1
to	1
the	1
winds	1
she	1
bewailed	1
herself	1
in	1
public;	1
all	1
signs	1
that	1
she	1
adored	1
me;	1
for	1
the	1
wrath	1
of	1
lovers	1
always	1
ends	1
in	1
curses.	1
I	1
had	1
no	1
hopes	1
to	1
give	1
her,	1
nor	1
treasures	1
to	1
offer	1
her,	1
for	1
mine	1
are	1
given	1
to	1
Dulcinea,	1
and	1
the	1
treasures	1
of	1
knights-errant	1
are	1
like	1
those	1
of	1
the	1
fairies,’	1
illusory	1
and	1
deceptive;	1
all	1
I	1
can	1
give	1
her	1
is	1
the	1
place	1
in	1
my	1
memory	1
I	1
keep	1
for	1
her,	1
without	1
prejudice,	1
however,	1
to	1
that	1
which	1
I	1
hold	1
devoted	1
to	1
Dulcinea,	1
whom	1
thou	1
art	1
wronging	1
by	1
thy	1
remissness	1
in	1
whipping	1
thyself	1
and	1
scourging	1
that	1
flesh—would	1
that	1
I	1
saw	1
it	1
eaten	1
by	1
wolves—which	1
would	1
rather	1
keep	1
itself	1
for	1
the	1
worms	1
than	1
for	1
the	1
relief	1
of	1
that	1
poor	1
lady.”	1
“Señor,”	1
replied	1
Sancho,	1
“if	1
the	1
truth	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
told,	1
I	1
cannot	1
persuade	1
myself	1
that	1
the	1
whipping	1
of	1
my	1
backside	1
has	1
anything	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
the	1
disenchantment	1
of	1
the	1
enchanted;	1
it	1
is	1
like	1
saying,	1
‘If	1
your	1
head	1
aches	1
rub	1
ointment	1
on	1
your	1
knees;’	1
at	1
any	1
rate	1
I’ll	1
make	1
bold	1
to	1
swear	1
that	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
histories	1
dealing	1
with	1
knight-errantry	1
that	1
your	1
worship	1
has	1
read	1
you	1
have	1
never	1
come	1
across	1
anybody	1
disenchanted	1
by	1
whipping;	1
but	1
whether	1
or	1
no	1
I’ll	1
whip	1
myself	1
when	1
I	1
have	1
a	1
fancy	1
for	1
it,	1
and	1
the	1
opportunity	1
serves	1
for	1
scourging	1
myself	1
comfortably.”	1
“God	1
grant	1
it,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
“and	1
heaven	1
give	1
thee	1
grace	1
to	1
take	1
it	1
to	1
heart	1
and	1
own	1
the	1
obligation	1
thou	1
art	1
under	1
to	1
help	1
my	1
lady,	1
who	1
is	1
thine	1
also,	1
inasmuch	1
as	1
thou	1
art	1
mine.”	1
As	1
they	1
pursued	1
their	1
journey	1
talking	1
in	1
this	1
way	1
they	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
very	1
same	1
spot	1
where	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
trampled	1
on	1
by	1
the	1
bulls.	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
recognised	1
it,	1
and	1
said	1
he	1
to	1
Sancho,	1
“This	1
is	1
the	1
meadow	1
where	1
we	1
came	1
upon	1
those	1
gay	1
shepherdesses	1
and	1
gallant	1
shepherds	1
who	1
were	1
trying	1
to	1
revive	1
and	1
imitate	1
the	1
pastoral	1
Arcadia	1
there,	1
an	1
idea	1
as	1
novel	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
happy,	1
in	1
emulation	1
whereof,	1
if	1
so	1
be	1
thou	1
dost	1
approve	1
of	1
it,	1
Sancho,	1
I	1
would	1
have	1
ourselves	1
turn	1
shepherds,	1
at	1
any	1
rate	1
for	1
the	1
time	1
I	1
have	1
to	1
live	1
in	1
retirement.	1
I	1
will	1
buy	1
some	1
ewes	1
and	1
everything	1
else	1
requisite	1
for	1
the	1
pastoral	1
calling;	1
and,	1
I	1
under	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
shepherd	1
Quixotize	1
and	1
thou	1
as	1
the	1
shepherd	1
Panzino,	1
we	1
will	1
roam	1
the	1
woods	1
and	1
groves	1
and	1
meadows	1
singing	1
songs	1
here,	1
lamenting	1
in	1
elegies	1
there,	1
drinking	1
of	1
the	1
crystal	1
waters	1
of	1
the	1
springs	1
or	1
limpid	1
brooks	1
or	1
flowing	1
rivers.	1
The	1
oaks	1
will	1
yield	1
us	1
their	1
sweet	1
fruit	1
with	1
bountiful	1
hand,	1
the	1
trunks	1
of	1
the	1
hard	1
cork	1
trees	1
a	1
seat,	1
the	1
willows	1
shade,	1
the	1
roses	1
perfume,	1
the	1
widespread	1
meadows	1
carpets	1
tinted	1
with	1
a	1
thousand	1
dyes;	1
the	1
clear	1
pure	1
air	1
will	1
give	1
us	1
breath,	1
the	1
moon	1
and	1
stars	1
lighten	1
the	1
darkness	1
of	1
the	1
night	1
for	1
us,	1
song	1
shall	1
be	1
our	1
delight,	1
lamenting	1
our	1
joy,	1
Apollo	1
will	1
supply	1
us	1
with	1
verses,	1
and	1
love	1
with	1
conceits	1
whereby	1
we	1
shall	1
make	1
ourselves	1
famed	1
for	1
ever,	1
not	1
only	1
in	1
this	1
but	1
in	1
ages	1
to	1
come.”	1
“Egad,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“but	1
that	1
sort	1
of	1
life	1
squares,	1
nay	1
corners,	1
with	1
my	1
notions;	1
and	1
what	1
is	1
more	1
the	1
bachelor	1
Samson	1
Carrasco	1
and	1
Master	1
Nicholas	1
the	1
barber	1
won’t	1
have	1
well	1
seen	1
it	1
before	1
they’ll	1
want	1
to	1
follow	1
it	1
and	1
turn	1
shepherds	1
along	1
with	1
us;	1
and	1
God	1
grant	1
it	1
may	1
not	1
come	1
into	1
the	1
curate’s	1
head	1
to	1
join	1
the	1
sheepfold	1
too,	1
he’s	1
so	1
jovial	1
and	1
fond	1
of	1
enjoying	1
himself.”	1
“Thou	1
art	1
in	1
the	1
right	1
of	1
it,	1
Sancho,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
“and	1
the	1
bachelor	1
Samson	1
Carrasco,	1
if	1
he	1
enters	1
the	1
pastoral	1
fraternity,	1
as	1
no	1
doubt	1
he	1
will,	1
may	1
call	1
himself	1
the	1
shepherd	1
Samsonino,	1
or	1
perhaps	1
the	1
shepherd	1
Carrascon;	1
Nicholas	1
the	1
barber	1
may	1
call	1
himself	1
Niculoso,	1
as	1
old	1
Boscan	1
formerly	1
was	1
called	1
Nemoroso;	1
as	1
for	1
the	1
curate	1
I	1
don’t	1
know	1
what	1
name	1
we	1
can	1
fit	1
to	1
him	1
unless	1
it	1
be	1
something	1
derived	1
from	1
his	1
title,	1
and	1
we	1
call	1
him	1
the	1
shepherd	1
Curiambro.	1
For	1
the	1
shepherdesses	1
whose	1
lovers	1
we	1
shall	1
be,	1
we	1
can	1
pick	1
names	1
as	1
we	1
would	1
pears;	1
and	1
as	1
my	1
lady’s	1
name	1
does	1
just	1
as	1
well	1
for	1
a	1
shepherdess’s	1
as	1
for	1
a	1
princess’s,	1
I	1
need	1
not	1
trouble	1
myself	1
to	1
look	1
for	1
one	1
that	1
will	1
suit	1
her	1
better;	1
to	1
thine,	1
Sancho,	1
thou	1
canst	1
give	1
what	1
name	1
thou	1
wilt.”	1
“I	1
don’t	1
mean	1
to	1
give	1
her	1
any	1
but	1
Teresona,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“which	1
will	1
go	1
well	1
with	1
her	1
stoutness	1
and	1
with	1
her	1
own	1
right	1
name,	1
as	1
she	1
is	1
called	1
Teresa;	1
and	1
then	1
when	1
I	1
sing	1
her	1
praises	1
in	1
my	1
verses	1
I’ll	1
show	1
how	1
chaste	1
my	1
passion	1
is,	1
for	1
I’m	1
not	1
going	1
to	1
look	1
‘for	1
better	1
bread	1
than	1
ever	1
came	1
from	1
wheat’	1
in	1
other	1
men’s	1
houses.	1
It	1
won’t	1
do	1
for	1
the	1
curate	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
shepherdess,	1
for	1
the	1
sake	1
of	1
good	1
example;	1
and	1
if	1
the	1
bachelor	1
chooses	1
to	1
have	1
one,	1
that	1
is	1
his	1
look-out.”	1
“God	1
bless	1
me,	1
Sancho	1
my	1
friend!”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“what	1
a	1
life	1
we	1
shall	1
lead!	1
What	1
hautboys	1
and	1
Zamora	1
bagpipes	1
we	1
shall	1
hear,	1
what	1
tabors,	1
timbrels,	1
and	1
rebecks!	1
And	1
then	1
if	1
among	1
all	1
these	1
different	1
sorts	1
of	1
music	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
albogues	1
is	1
heard,	1
almost	1
all	1
the	1
pastoral	1
instruments	1
will	1
be	1
there.”	1
“What	1
are	1
albogues?”	1
asked	1
Sancho,	1
“for	1
I	1
never	1
in	1
my	1
life	1
heard	1
tell	1
of	1
them	1
or	1
saw	1
them.”	1
“Albogues,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“are	1
brass	1
plates	1
like	1
candlesticks	1
that	1
struck	1
against	1
one	1
another	1
on	1
the	1
hollow	1
side	1
make	1
a	1
noise	1
which,	1
if	1
not	1
very	1
pleasing	1
or	1
harmonious,	1
is	1
not	1
disagreeable	1
and	1
accords	1
very	1
well	1
with	1
the	1
rude	1
notes	1
of	1
the	1
bagpipe	1
and	1
tabor.	1
The	1
word	1
albogue	1
is	1
Morisco,	1
as	1
are	1
all	1
those	1
in	1
our	1
Spanish	1
tongue	1
that	1
begin	1
with	1
_al;_	1
for	1
example,	1
_almohaza,	1
almorzar,	1
alhombra,	1
alguacil,	1
alhucema,	1
almacen,	1
alcancia_,	1
and	1
others	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
sort,	1
of	1
which	1
there	1
are	1
not	1
many	1
more;	1
our	1
language	1
has	1
only	1
three	1
that	1
are	1
Morisco	1
and	1
end	1
in	1
_i_,	1
which	1
are	1
_borceguí,	1
zaquizamí_,	1
and	1
_maravedí.	1
Alhelí_	1
and	1
_alfaquí_	1
are	1
seen	1
to	1
be	1
Arabic,	1
as	1
well	1
by	1
the	1
_al_	1
at	1
the	1
beginning	1
as	1
by	1
the	1
_í_	1
they	1
end	1
with.	1
I	1
mention	1
this	1
incidentally,	1
the	1
chance	1
allusion	1
to	1
albogues	1
having	1
reminded	1
me	1
of	1
it;	1
and	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
of	1
great	1
assistance	1
to	1
us	1
in	1
the	1
perfect	1
practice	1
of	1
this	1
calling	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
something	1
of	1
a	1
poet,	1
as	1
thou	1
knowest,	1
and	1
that	1
besides	1
the	1
bachelor	1
Samson	1
Carrasco	1
is	1
an	1
accomplished	1
one.	1
Of	1
the	1
curate	1
I	1
say	1
nothing;	1
but	1
I	1
will	1
wager	1
he	1
has	1
some	1
spice	1
of	1
the	1
poet	1
in	1
him,	1
and	1
no	1
doubt	1
Master	1
Nicholas	1
too,	1
for	1
all	1
barbers,	1
or	1
most	1
of	1
them,	1
are	1
guitar	1
players	1
and	1
stringers	1
of	1
verses.	1
I	1
will	1
bewail	1
my	1
separation;	1
thou	1
shalt	1
glorify	1
thyself	1
as	1
a	1
constant	1
lover;	1
the	1
shepherd	1
Carrascon	1
will	1
figure	1
as	1
a	1
rejected	1
one,	1
and	1
the	1
curate	1
Curiambro	1
as	1
whatever	1
may	1
please	1
him	1
best;	1
and	1
so	1
all	1
will	1
go	1
as	1
gaily	1
as	1
heart	1
could	1
wish.”	1
To	1
this	1
Sancho	1
made	1
answer,	1
“I	1
am	1
so	1
unlucky,	1
señor,	1
that	1
I’m	1
afraid	1
the	1
day	1
will	1
never	1
come	1
when	1
I’ll	1
see	1
myself	1
at	1
such	1
a	1
calling.	1
O	1
what	1
neat	1
spoons	1
I’ll	1
make	1
when	1
I’m	1
a	1
shepherd!	1
What	1
messes,	1
creams,	1
garlands,	1
pastoral	1
odds	1
and	1
ends!	1
And	1
if	1
they	1
don’t	1
get	1
me	1
a	1
name	1
for	1
wisdom,	1
they’ll	1
not	1
fail	1
to	1
get	1
me	1
one	1
for	1
ingenuity.	1
My	1
daughter	1
Sanchica	1
will	1
bring	1
us	1
our	1
dinner	1
to	1
the	1
pasture.	1
But	1
stay—she’s	1
good-looking,	1
and	1
shepherds	1
there	1
are	1
with	1
more	1
mischief	1
than	1
simplicity	1
in	1
them;	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
her	1
‘come	1
for	1
wool	1
and	1
go	1
back	1
shorn;’	1
love-making	1
and	1
lawless	1
desires	1
are	1
just	1
as	1
common	1
in	1
the	1
fields	1
as	1
in	1
the	1
cities,	1
and	1
in	1
shepherds’	1
shanties	1
as	1
in	1
royal	1
palaces;	1
‘do	1
away	1
with	1
the	1
cause,	1
you	1
do	1
away	1
with	1
the	1
sin;’	1
‘if	1
eyes	1
don’t	1
see	1
hearts	1
don’t	1
break’	1
and	1
‘better	1
a	1
clear	1
escape	1
than	1
good	1
men’s	1
prayers.’”	1
“A	1
truce	1
to	1
thy	1
proverbs,	1
Sancho,”	1
exclaimed	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
“any	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
thou	1
hast	1
uttered	1
would	1
suffice	1
to	1
explain	1
thy	1
meaning;	1
many	1
a	1
time	1
have	1
I	1
recommended	1
thee	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
so	1
lavish	1
with	1
proverbs	1
and	1
to	1
exercise	1
some	1
moderation	1
in	1
delivering	1
them;	1
but	1
it	1
seems	1
to	1
me	1
it	1
is	1
only	1
‘preaching	1
in	1
the	1
desert;’	1
‘my	1
mother	1
beats	1
me	1
and	1
I	1
go	1
on	1
with	1
my	1
tricks.”	1
“It	1
seems	1
to	1
me,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“that	1
your	1
worship	1
is	1
like	1
the	1
common	1
saying,	1
‘Said	1
the	1
frying-pan	1
to	1
the	1
kettle,	1
Get	1
away,	1
blackbreech.’	1
You	1
chide	1
me	1
for	1
uttering	1
proverbs,	1
and	1
you	1
string	1
them	1
in	1
couples	1
yourself.”	1
“Observe,	1
Sancho,”	1
replied	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“I	1
bring	1
in	1
proverbs	1
to	1
the	1
purpose,	1
and	1
when	1
I	1
quote	1
them	1
they	1
fit	1
like	1
a	1
ring	1
to	1
the	1
finger;	1
thou	1
bringest	1
them	1
in	1
by	1
the	1
head	1
and	1
shoulders,	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
way	1
that	1
thou	1
dost	1
drag	1
them	1
in,	1
rather	1
than	1
introduce	1
them;	1
if	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
mistaken,	1
I	1
have	1
told	1
thee	1
already	1
that	1
proverbs	1
are	1
short	1
maxims	1
drawn	1
from	1
the	1
experience	1
and	1
observation	1
of	1
our	1
wise	1
men	1
of	1
old;	1
but	1
the	1
proverb	1
that	1
is	1
not	1
to	1
the	1
purpose	1
is	1
a	1
piece	1
of	1
nonsense	1
and	1
not	1
a	1
maxim.	1
But	1
enough	1
of	1
this;	1
as	1
nightfall	1
is	1
drawing	1
on	1
let	1
us	1
retire	1
some	1
little	1
distance	1
from	1
the	1
high	1
road	1
to	1
pass	1
the	1
night;	1
what	1
is	1
in	1
store	1
for	1
us	1
to-morrow	1
God	1
knoweth.”	1
They	1
turned	1
aside,	1
and	1
supped	1
late	1
and	1
poorly,	1
very	1
much	1
against	1
Sancho’s	1
will,	1
who	1
turned	1
over	1
in	1
his	1
mind	1
the	1
hardships	1
attendant	1
upon	1
knight-errantry	1
in	1
woods	1
and	1
forests,	1
even	1
though	1
at	1
times	1
plenty	1
presented	1
itself	1
in	1
castles	1
and	1
houses,	1
as	1
at	1
Don	1
Diego	1
de	1
Miranda’s,	1
at	1
the	1
wedding	1
of	1
Camacho	1
the	1
Rich,	1
and	1
at	1
Don	1
Antonio	1
Moreno’s;	1
he	1
reflected,	1
however,	1
that	1
it	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
always	1
day,	1
nor	1
always	1
night;	1
and	1
so	1
that	1
night	1
he	1
passed	1
in	1
sleeping,	1
and	1
his	1
master	1
in	1
waking.	1

LXVIII.	1
OF	1
THE	1
BRISTLY	1
ADVENTURE	1
THAT	1
BEFELL	1
DON	1
QUIXOTE	1
p68a.jpg	1
(119K)	1
Full	1
Size	1
The	1
night	1
was	1
somewhat	1
dark,	1
for	1
though	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
moon	1
in	1
the	1
sky	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
in	1
a	1
quarter	1
where	1
she	1
could	1
be	1
seen;	1
for	1
sometimes	1
the	1
lady	1
Diana	1
goes	1
on	1
a	1
stroll	1
to	1
the	1
antipodes,	1
and	1
leaves	1
the	1
mountains	1
all	1
black	1
and	1
the	1
valleys	1
in	1
darkness.	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
obeyed	1
nature	1
so	1
far	1
as	1
to	1
sleep	1
his	1
first	1
sleep,	1
but	1
did	1
not	1
give	1
way	1
to	1
the	1
second,	1
very	1
different	1
from	1
Sancho,	1
who	1
never	1
had	1
any	1
second,	1
because	1
with	1
him	1
sleep	1
lasted	1
from	1
night	1
till	1
morning,	1
wherein	1
he	1
showed	1
what	1
a	1
sound	1
constitution	1
and	1
few	1
cares	1
he	1
had.	1
Don	1
Quixote’s	1
cares	1
kept	1
him	1
restless,	1
so	1
much	1
so	1
that	1
he	1
awoke	1
Sancho	1
and	1
said	1
to	1
him,	1
“I	1
am	1
amazed,	1
Sancho,	1
at	1
the	1
unconcern	1
of	1
thy	1
temperament.	1
I	1
believe	1
thou	1
art	1
made	1
of	1
marble	1
or	1
hard	1
brass,	1
incapable	1
of	1
any	1
emotion	1
or	1
feeling	1
whatever.	1
I	1
lie	1
awake	1
while	1
thou	1
sleepest,	1
I	1
weep	1
while	1
thou	1
singest,	1
I	1
am	1
faint	1
with	1
fasting	1
while	1
thou	1
art	1
sluggish	1
and	1
torpid	1
from	1
pure	1
repletion.	1
It	1
is	1
the	1
duty	1
of	1
good	1
servants	1
to	1
share	1
the	1
sufferings	1
and	1
feel	1
the	1
sorrows	1
of	1
their	1
masters,	1
if	1
it	1
be	1
only	1
for	1
the	1
sake	1
of	1
appearances.	1
See	1
the	1
calmness	1
of	1
the	1
night,	1
the	1
solitude	1
of	1
the	1
spot,	1
inviting	1
us	1
to	1
break	1
our	1
slumbers	1
by	1
a	1
vigil	1
of	1
some	1
sort.	1
Rise	1
as	1
thou	1
livest,	1
and	1
retire	1
a	1
little	1
distance,	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
good	1
heart	1
and	1
cheerful	1
courage	1
give	1
thyself	1
three	1
or	1
four	1
hundred	1
lashes	1
on	1
account	1
of	1
Dulcinea’s	1
disenchantment	1
score;	1
and	1
this	1
I	1
entreat	1
of	1
thee,	1
making	1
it	1
a	1
request,	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
desire	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
grips	1
with	1
thee	1
a	1
second	1
time,	1
as	1
I	1
know	1
thou	1
hast	1
a	1
heavy	1
hand.	1
As	1
soon	1
as	1
thou	1
hast	1
laid	1
them	1
on	1
we	1
will	1
pass	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
night,	1
I	1
singing	1
my	1
separation,	1
thou	1
thy	1
constancy,	1
making	1
a	1
beginning	1
at	1
once	1
with	1
the	1
pastoral	1
life	1
we	1
are	1
to	1
follow	1
at	1
our	1
village.”	1
“Señor,”	1
replied	1
Sancho,	1
“I’m	1
no	1
monk	1
to	1
get	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
my	1
sleep	1
and	1
scourge	1
myself,	1
nor	1
does	1
it	1
seem	1
to	1
me	1
that	1
one	1
can	1
pass	1
from	1
one	1
extreme	1
of	1
the	1
pain	1
of	1
whipping	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
of	1
music.	1
Will	1
your	1
worship	1
let	1
me	1
sleep,	1
and	1
not	1
worry	1
me	1
about	1
whipping	1
myself?	1
or	1
you’ll	1
make	1
me	1
swear	1
never	1
to	1
touch	1
a	1
hair	1
of	1
my	1
doublet,	1
not	1
to	1
say	1
my	1
flesh.”	1
“O	1
hard	1
heart!”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“O	1
pitiless	1
squire!	1
O	1
bread	1
ill-bestowed	1
and	1
favours	1
ill-acknowledged,	1
both	1
those	1
I	1
have	1
done	1
thee	1
and	1
those	1
I	1
mean	1
to	1
do	1
thee!	1
Through	1
me	1
hast	1
thou	1
seen	1
thyself	1
a	1
governor,	1
and	1
through	1
me	1
thou	1
seest	1
thyself	1
in	1
immediate	1
expectation	1
of	1
being	1
a	1
count,	1
or	1
obtaining	1
some	1
other	1
equivalent	1
title,	1
for	1
I—_post	1
tenebras	1
spero	1
lucem_.”	1
“I	1
don’t	1
know	1
what	1
that	1
is,”	1
said	1
Sancho;	1
“all	1
I	1
know	1
is	1
that	1
so	1
long	1
as	1
I	1
am	1
asleep	1
I	1
have	1
neither	1
fear	1
nor	1
hope,	1
trouble	1
nor	1
glory;	1
and	1
good	1
luck	1
betide	1
him	1
that	1
invented	1
sleep,	1
the	1
cloak	1
that	1
covers	1
over	1
all	1
a	1
man’s	1
thoughts,	1
the	1
food	1
that	1
removes	1
hunger,	1
the	1
drink	1
that	1
drives	1
away	1
thirst,	1
the	1
fire	1
that	1
warms	1
the	1
cold,	1
the	1
cold	1
that	1
tempers	1
the	1
heat,	1
and,	1
to	1
wind	1
up	1
with,	1
the	1
universal	1
coin	1
wherewith	1
everything	1
is	1
bought,	1
the	1
weight	1
and	1
balance	1
that	1
makes	1
the	1
shepherd	1
equal	1
with	1
the	1
king	1
and	1
the	1
fool	1
with	1
the	1
wise	1
man.	1
Sleep,	1
I	1
have	1
heard	1
say,	1
has	1
only	1
one	1
fault,	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
like	1
death;	1
for	1
between	1
a	1
sleeping	1
man	1
and	1
a	1
dead	1
man	1
there	1
is	1
very	1
little	1
difference.”	1
“Never	1
have	1
I	1
heard	1
thee	1
speak	1
so	1
elegantly	1
as	1
now,	1
Sancho,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
“and	1
here	1
I	1
begin	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
truth	1
of	1
the	1
proverb	1
thou	1
dost	1
sometimes	1
quote,	1
‘Not	1
with	1
whom	1
thou	1
art	1
bred,	1
but	1
with	1
whom	1
thou	1
art	1
fed.’”	1
“Ha,	1
by	1
my	1
life,	1
master	1
mine,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“it’s	1
not	1
I	1
that	1
am	1
stringing	1
proverbs	1
now,	1
for	1
they	1
drop	1
in	1
pairs	1
from	1
your	1
worship’s	1
mouth	1
faster	1
than	1
from	1
mine;	1
only	1
there	1
is	1
this	1
difference	1
between	1
mine	1
and	1
yours,	1
that	1
yours	1
are	1
well-timed	1
and	1
mine	1
are	1
untimely;	1
but	1
anyhow,	1
they	1
are	1
all	1
proverbs.”	1
At	1
this	1
point	1
they	1
became	1
aware	1
of	1
a	1
harsh	1
indistinct	1
noise	1
that	1
seemed	1
to	1
spread	1
through	1
all	1
the	1
valleys	1
around.	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
stood	1
up	1
and	1
laid	1
his	1
hand	1
upon	1
his	1
sword,	1
and	1
Sancho	1
ensconced	1
himself	1
under	1
Dapple	1
and	1
put	1
the	1
bundle	1
of	1
armour	1
on	1
one	1
side	1
of	1
him	1
and	1
the	1
ass’s	1
pack-saddle	1
on	1
the	1
other,	1
in	1
fear	1
and	1
trembling	1
as	1
great	1
as	1
Don	1
Quixote’s	1
perturbation.	1
Each	1
instant	1
the	1
noise	1
increased	1
and	1
came	1
nearer	1
to	1
the	1
two	1
terrified	1
men,	1
or	1
at	1
least	1
to	1
one,	1
for	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
other,	1
his	1
courage	1
is	1
known	1
to	1
all.	1
The	1
fact	1
of	1
the	1
matter	1
was	1
that	1
some	1
men	1
were	1
taking	1
above	1
six	1
hundred	1
pigs	1
to	1
sell	1
at	1
a	1
fair,	1
and	1
were	1
on	1
their	1
way	1
with	1
them	1
at	1
that	1
hour,	1
and	1
so	1
great	1
was	1
the	1
noise	1
they	1
made	1
and	1
their	1
grunting	1
and	1
blowing,	1
that	1
they	1
deafened	1
the	1
ears	1
of	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
and	1
Sancho	1
Panza,	1
and	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
make	1
out	1
what	1
it	1
was.	1
The	1
wide-spread	1
grunting	1
drove	1
came	1
on	1
in	1
a	1
surging	1
mass,	1
and	1
without	1
showing	1
any	1
respect	1
for	1
Don	1
Quixote’s	1
dignity	1
or	1
Sancho’s,	1
passed	1
right	1
over	1
the	1
pair	1
of	1
them,	1
demolishing	1
Sancho’s	1
entrenchments,	1
and	1
not	1
only	1
upsetting	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
but	1
sweeping	1
Rocinante	1
off	1
his	1
feet	1
into	1
the	1
bargain;	1
and	1
what	1
with	1
the	1
trampling	1
and	1
the	1
grunting,	1
and	1
the	1
pace	1
at	1
which	1
the	1
unclean	1
beasts	1
went,	1
pack-saddle,	1
armour,	1
Dapple	1
and	1
Rocinante	1
were	1
left	1
scattered	1
on	1
the	1
ground	1
and	1
Sancho	1
and	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
at	1
their	1
wits’	1
end.	1
Sancho	1
got	1
up	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
he	1
could	1
and	1
begged	1
his	1
master	1
to	1
give	1
him	1
his	1
sword,	1
saying	1
he	1
wanted	1
to	1
kill	1
half	1
a	1
dozen	1
of	1
those	1
dirty	1
unmannerly	1
pigs,	1
for	1
he	1
had	1
by	1
this	1
time	1
found	1
out	1
that	1
that	1
was	1
what	1
they	1
were.	1
“Let	1
them	1
be,	1
my	1
friend,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
“this	1
insult	1
is	1
the	1
penalty	1
of	1
my	1
sin;	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
righteous	1
chastisement	1
of	1
heaven	1
that	1
jackals	1
should	1
devour	1
a	1
vanquished	1
knight,	1
and	1
wasps	1
sting	1
him	1
and	1
pigs	1
trample	1
him	1
under	1
foot.”	1
“I	1
suppose	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
chastisement	1
of	1
heaven,	1
too,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“that	1
flies	1
should	1
prick	1
the	1
squires	1
of	1
vanquished	1
knights,	1
and	1
lice	1
eat	1
them,	1
and	1
hunger	1
assail	1
them.	1
If	1
we	1
squires	1
were	1
the	1
sons	1
of	1
the	1
knights	1
we	1
serve,	1
or	1
their	1
very	1
near	1
relations,	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
no	1
wonder	1
if	1
the	1
penalty	1
of	1
their	1
misdeeds	1
overtook	1
us,	1
even	1
to	1
the	1
fourth	1
generation.	1
But	1
what	1
have	1
the	1
Panzas	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
the	1
Quixotes?	1
Well,	1
well,	1
let’s	1
lie	1
down	1
again	1
and	1
sleep	1
out	1
what	1
little	1
of	1
the	1
night	1
there’s	1
left,	1
and	1
God	1
will	1
send	1
us	1
dawn	1
and	1
we	1
shall	1
be	1
all	1
right.”	1

“Sleep	1
thou,	1
Sancho,”	1
returned	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“for	1
thou	1
wast	1
born	1
to	1
sleep	1
as	1
I	1
was	1
born	1
to	1
watch;	1
and	1
during	1
the	1
time	1
it	1
now	1
wants	1
of	1
dawn	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
a	1
loose	1
rein	1
to	1
my	1
thoughts,	1
and	1
seek	1
a	1
vent	1
for	1
them	1
in	1
a	1
little	1
madrigal	1
which,	1
unknown	1
to	1
thee,	1
I	1
composed	1
in	1
my	1
head	1
last	1
night.”	1
“I	1
should	1
think,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“that	1
the	1
thoughts	1
that	1
allow	1
one	1
to	1
make	1
verses	1
cannot	1
be	1
of	1
great	1
consequence;	1
let	1
your	1
worship	1
string	1
verses	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
you	1
like	1
and	1
I’ll	1
sleep	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
I	1
can;”	1
and	1
forthwith,	1
taking	1
the	1
space	1
of	1
ground	1
he	1
required,	1
he	1
muffled	1
himself	1
up	1
and	1
fell	1
into	1
a	1
sound	1
sleep,	1
undisturbed	1
by	1
bond,	1
debt,	1
or	1
trouble	1
of	1
any	1
sort.	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
propped	1
up	1
against	1
the	1
trunk	1
of	1
a	1
beech	1
or	1
a	1
cork	1
tree—for	1
Cide	1
Hamete	1
does	1
not	1
specify	1
what	1
kind	1
of	1
tree	1
it	1
was—sang	1
in	1
this	1
strain	1
to	1
the	1
accompaniment	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
sighs:	1
When	1
in	1
my	1
mind	1
I	1
muse,	1
O	1
Love,	1
upon	1
thy	1
cruelty,	1
To	1
death	1
I	1
flee,	1
In	1
hope	1
therein	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
all	1
to	1
find.	1
But	1
drawing	1
near	1
That	1
welcome	1
haven	1
in	1
my	1
sea	1
of	1
woe,	1
Such	1
joy	1
I	1
know,	1
That	1
life	1
revives,	1
and	1
still	1
I	1
linger	1
here.	1
Thus	1
life	1
doth	1
slay,	1
And	1
death	1
again	1
to	1
life	1
restoreth	1
me;	1
Strange	1
destiny,	1
That	1
deals	1
with	1
life	1
and	1
death	1
as	1
with	1
a	1
play!	1
He	1
accompanied	1
each	1
verse	1
with	1
many	1
sighs	1
and	1
not	1
a	1
few	1
tears,	1
just	1
like	1
one	1
whose	1
heart	1
was	1
pierced	1
with	1
grief	1
at	1
his	1
defeat	1
and	1
his	1
separation	1
from	1
Dulcinea.	1
And	1
now	1
daylight	1
came,	1
and	1
the	1
sun	1
smote	1
Sancho	1
on	1
the	1
eyes	1
with	1
his	1
beams.	1
He	1
awoke,	1
roused	1
himself	1
up,	1
shook	1
himself	1
and	1
stretched	1
his	1
lazy	1
limbs,	1
and	1
seeing	1
the	1
havoc	1
the	1
pigs	1
had	1
made	1
with	1
his	1
stores	1
he	1
cursed	1
the	1
drove,	1
and	1
more	1
besides.	1
Then	1
the	1
pair	1
resumed	1
their	1
journey,	1
and	1
as	1
evening	1
closed	1
in	1
they	1
saw	1
coming	1
towards	1
them	1
some	1
ten	1
men	1
on	1
horseback	1
and	1
four	1
or	1
five	1
on	1
foot.	1
Don	1
Quixote’s	1
heart	1
beat	1
quick	1
and	1
Sancho’s	1
quailed	1
with	1
fear,	1
for	1
the	1
persons	1
approaching	1
them	1
carried	1
lances	1
and	1
bucklers,	1
and	1
were	1
in	1
very	1
warlike	1
guise.	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
turned	1
to	1
Sancho	1
and	1
said,	1
“If	1
I	1
could	1
make	1
use	1
of	1
my	1
weapons,	1
and	1
my	1
promise	1
had	1
not	1
tied	1
my	1
hands,	1
I	1
would	1
count	1
this	1
host	1
that	1
comes	1
against	1
us	1
but	1
cakes	1
and	1
fancy	1
bread;	1
but	1
perhaps	1
it	1
may	1
prove	1
something	1
different	1
from	1
what	1
we	1
apprehend.”	1
The	1
men	1
on	1
horseback	1
now	1
came	1
up,	1
and	1
raising	1
their	1
lances	1
surrounded	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
in	1
silence,	1
and	1
pointed	1
them	1
at	1
his	1
back	1
and	1
breast,	1
menacing	1
him	1
with	1
death.	1
One	1
of	1
those	1
on	1
foot,	1
putting	1
his	1
finger	1
to	1
his	1
lips	1
as	1
a	1
sign	1
to	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
silent,	1
seized	1
Rocinante’s	1
bridle	1
and	1
drew	1
him	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
road,	1
and	1
the	1
others	1
driving	1
Sancho	1
and	1
Dapple	1
before	1
them,	1
and	1
all	1
maintaining	1
a	1
strange	1
silence,	1
followed	1
in	1
the	1
steps	1
of	1
the	1
one	1
who	1
led	1
Don	1
Quixote.	1
The	1
latter	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
times	1
attempted	1
to	1
ask	1
where	1
they	1
were	1
taking	1
him	1
to	1
and	1
what	1
they	1
wanted,	1
but	1
the	1
instant	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
open	1
his	1
lips	1
they	1
threatened	1
to	1
close	1
them	1
with	1
the	1
points	1
of	1
their	1
lances;	1
and	1
Sancho	1
fared	1
the	1
same	1
way,	1
for	1
the	1
moment	1
he	1
seemed	1
about	1
to	1
speak	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
on	1
foot	1
punched	1
him	1
with	1
a	1
goad,	1
and	1
Dapple	1
likewise,	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
too	1
wanted	1
to	1
talk.	1
Night	1
set	1
in,	1
they	1
quickened	1
their	1
pace,	1
and	1
the	1
fears	1
of	1
the	1
two	1
prisoners	1
grew	1
greater,	1
especially	1
as	1
they	1
heard	1
themselves	1
assailed	1
with—“Get	1
on,	1
ye	1
Troglodytes;”	1
“Silence,	1
ye	1
barbarians;”	1
“March,	1
ye	1
cannibals;”	1
“No	1
murmuring,	1
ye	1
Scythians;”	1
“Don’t	1
open	1
your	1
eyes,	1
ye	1
murderous	1
Polyphemes,	1
ye	1
blood-thirsty	1
lions,”	1
and	1
suchlike	1
names	1
with	1
which	1
their	1
captors	1
harassed	1
the	1
ears	1
of	1
the	1
wretched	1
master	1
and	1
man.	1
Sancho	1
went	1
along	1
saying	1
to	1
himself,	1
“We,	1
tortolites,	1
barbers,	1
animals!	1
I	1
don’t	1
like	1
those	1
names	1
at	1
all;	1
‘it’s	1
in	1
a	1
bad	1
wind	1
our	1
corn	1
is	1
being	1
winnowed;’	1
‘misfortune	1
comes	1
upon	1
us	1
all	1
at	1
once	1
like	1
sticks	1
on	1
a	1
dog,’	1
and	1
God	1
grant	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
no	1
worse	1
than	1
them	1
that	1
this	1
unlucky	1
adventure	1
has	1
in	1
store	1
for	1
us.”	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
rode	1
completely	1
dazed,	1
unable	1
with	1
the	1
aid	1
of	1
all	1
his	1
wits	1
to	1
make	1
out	1
what	1
could	1
be	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
these	1
abusive	1
names	1
they	1
called	1
them,	1
and	1
the	1
only	1
conclusion	1
he	1
could	1
arrive	1
at	1
was	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
good	1
to	1
be	1
hoped	1
for	1
and	1
much	1
evil	1
to	1
be	1
feared.	1
And	1
now,	1
about	1
an	1
hour	1
after	1
midnight,	1
they	1
reached	1
a	1
castle	1
which	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
saw	1
at	1
once	1
was	1
the	1
duke’s,	1
where	1
they	1
had	1
been	1
but	1
a	1
short	1
time	1
before.	1
“God	1
bless	1
me!”	1
said	1
he,	1
as	1
he	1
recognised	1
the	1
mansion,	1
“what	1
does	1
this	1
mean?	1
It	1
is	1
all	1
courtesy	1
and	1
politeness	1
in	1
this	1
house;	1
but	1
with	1
the	1
vanquished	1
good	1
turns	1
into	1
evil,	1
and	1
evil	1
into	1
worse.”	1
They	1
entered	1
the	1
chief	1
court	1
of	1
the	1
castle	1
and	1
found	1
it	1
prepared	1
and	1
fitted	1
up	1
in	1
a	1
style	1
that	1
added	1
to	1
their	1
amazement	1
and	1
doubled	1
their	1
fears,	1
as	1
will	1
be	1
seen	1
in	1

The	1
horsemen	1
dismounted,	1
and,	1
together	1
with	1
the	1
men	1
on	1
foot,	1
without	1
a	1
moment’s	1
delay	1
taking	1
up	1
Sancho	1
and	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
bodily,	1
they	1
carried	1
them	1
into	1
the	1
court,	1
all	1
round	1
which	1
near	1
a	1
hundred	1
torches	1
fixed	1
in	1
sockets	1
were	1
burning,	1
besides	1
above	1
five	1
hundred	1
lamps	1
in	1
the	1
corridors,	1
so	1
that	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
the	1
night,	1
which	1
was	1
somewhat	1
dark,	1
the	1
want	1
of	1
daylight	1
could	1
not	1
be	1
perceived.	1
In	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
court	1
was	1
a	1
catafalque,	1
raised	1
about	1
two	1
yards	1
above	1
the	1
ground	1
and	1
covered	1
completely	1
by	1
an	1
immense	1
canopy	1
of	1
black	1
velvet,	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
steps	1
all	1
round	1
it	1
white	1
wax	1
tapers	1
burned	1
in	1
more	1
than	1
a	1
hundred	1
silver	1
candlesticks.	1
Upon	1
the	1
catafalque	1
was	1
seen	1
the	1
dead	1
body	1
of	1
a	1
damsel	1
so	1
lovely	1
that	1
by	1
her	1
beauty	1
she	1
made	1
death	1
itself	1
look	1
beautiful.	1
She	1
lay	1
with	1
her	1
head	1
resting	1
upon	1
a	1
cushion	1
of	1
brocade	1
and	1
crowned	1
with	1
a	1
garland	1
of	1
sweet-smelling	1
flowers	1
of	1
divers	1
sorts,	1
her	1
hands	1
crossed	1
upon	1
her	1
bosom,	1
and	1
between	1
them	1
a	1
branch	1
of	1
yellow	1
palm	1
of	1
victory.	1
On	1
one	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
court	1
was	1
erected	1
a	1
stage,	1
where	1
upon	1
two	1
chairs	1
were	1
seated	1
two	1
persons	1
who	1
from	1
having	1
crowns	1
on	1
their	1
heads	1
and	1
sceptres	1
in	1
their	1
hands	1
appeared	1
to	1
be	1
kings	1
of	1
some	1
sort,	1
whether	1
real	1
or	1
mock	1
ones.	1
By	1
the	1
side	1
of	1
this	1
stage,	1
which	1
was	1
reached	1
by	1
steps,	1
were	1
two	1
other	1
chairs	1
on	1
which	1
the	1
men	1
carrying	1
the	1
prisoners	1
seated	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
and	1
Sancho,	1
all	1
in	1
silence,	1
and	1
by	1
signs	1
giving	1
them	1
to	1
understand	1
that	1
they	1
too	1
were	1
to	1
be	1
silent;	1
which,	1
however,	1
they	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
without	1
any	1
signs,	1
for	1
their	1
amazement	1
at	1
all	1
they	1
saw	1
held	1
them	1
tongue-tied.	1
And	1
now	1
two	1
persons	1
of	1
distinction,	1
who	1
were	1
at	1
once	1
recognised	1
by	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
as	1
his	1
hosts	1
the	1
duke	1
and	1
duchess,	1
ascended	1
the	1
stage	1
attended	1
by	1
a	1
numerous	1
suite,	1
and	1
seated	1
themselves	1
on	1
two	1
gorgeous	1
chairs	1
close	1
to	1
the	1
two	1
kings,	1
as	1
they	1
seemed	1
to	1
be.	1
Who	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
been	1
amazed	1
at	1
this?	1
Nor	1
was	1
this	1
all,	1
for	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
had	1
perceived	1
that	1
the	1
dead	1
body	1
on	1
the	1
catafalque	1
was	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
fair	1
Altisidora.	1
As	1
the	1
duke	1
and	1
duchess	1
mounted	1
the	1
stage	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
and	1
Sancho	1
rose	1
and	1
made	1
them	1
a	1
profound	1
obeisance,	1
which	1
they	1
returned	1
by	1
bowing	1
their	1
heads	1
slightly.	1
At	1
this	1
moment	1
an	1
official	1
crossed	1
over,	1
and	1
approaching	1
Sancho	1
threw	1
over	1
him	1
a	1
robe	1
of	1
black	1
buckram	1
painted	1
all	1
over	1
with	1
flames	1
of	1
fire,	1
and	1
taking	1
off	1
his	1
cap	1
put	1
upon	1
his	1
head	1
a	1
mitre	1
such	1
as	1
those	1
undergoing	1
the	1
sentence	1
of	1
the	1
Holy	1
Office	1
wear;	1
and	1
whispered	1
in	1
his	1
ear	1
that	1
he	1
must	1
not	1
open	1
his	1
lips,	1
or	1
they	1
would	1
put	1
a	1
gag	1
upon	1
him,	1
or	1
take	1
his	1
life.	1
Sancho	1
surveyed	1
himself	1
from	1
head	1
to	1
foot	1
and	1
saw	1
himself	1
all	1
ablaze	1
with	1
flames;	1
but	1
as	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
burn	1
him,	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
care	1
two	1
farthings	1
for	1
them.	1
He	1
took	1
off	1
the	1
mitre	1
and	1
seeing	1
it	1
painted	1
with	1
devils	1
he	1
put	1
it	1
on	1
again,	1
saying	1
to	1
himself,	1
“Well,	1
so	1
far	1
those	1
don’t	1
burn	1
me	1
nor	1
do	1
these	1
carry	1
me	1
off.”	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
surveyed	1
him	1
too,	1
and	1
though	1
fear	1
had	1
got	1
the	1
better	1
of	1
his	1
faculties,	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
help	1
smiling	1
to	1
see	1
the	1
figure	1
Sancho	1
presented.	1
And	1
now	1
from	1
underneath	1
the	1
catafalque,	1
so	1
it	1
seemed,	1
there	1
rose	1
a	1
low	1
sweet	1
sound	1
of	1
flutes,	1
which,	1
coming	1
unbroken	1
by	1
human	1
voice	1
(for	1
there	1
silence	1
itself	1
kept	1
silence),	1
had	1
a	1
soft	1
and	1
languishing	1
effect.	1
Then,	1
beside	1
the	1
pillow	1
of	1
what	1
seemed	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
dead	1
body,	1
suddenly	1
appeared	1
a	1
fair	1
youth	1
in	1
a	1
Roman	1
habit,	1
who,	1
to	1
the	1
accompaniment	1
of	1
a	1
harp	1
which	1
he	1
himself	1
played,	1
sang	1
in	1
a	1
sweet	1
and	1
clear	1
voice	1
these	1
two	1
stanzas:	1
While	1
fair	1
Altisidora,	1
who	1
the	1
sport	1
Of	1
cold	1
Don	1
Quixote’s	1
cruelty	1
hath	1
been,	1
Returns	1
to	1
life,	1
and	1
in	1
this	1
magic	1
court	1
The	1
dames	1
in	1
sables	1
come	1
to	1
grace	1
the	1
scene,	1
And	1
while	1
her	1
matrons	1
all	1
in	1
seemly	1
sort	1
My	1
lady	1
robes	1
in	1
baize	1
and	1
bombazine,	1
Her	1
beauty	1
and	1
her	1
sorrows	1
will	1
I	1
sing	1
With	1
defter	1
quill	1
than	1
touched	1
the	1
Thracian	1
string.	1
But	1
not	1
in	1
life	1
alone,	1
methinks,	1
to	1
me	1
Belongs	1
the	1
office;	1
Lady,	1
when	1
my	1
tongue	1
Is	1
cold	1
in	1
death,	1
believe	1
me,	1
unto	1
thee	1
My	1
voice	1
shall	1
raise	1
its	1
tributary	1
song.	1
My	1
soul,	1
from	1
this	1
strait	1
prison-house	1
set	1
free,	1
As	1
o’er	1
the	1
Stygian	1
lake	1
it	1
floats	1
along,	1
Thy	1
praises	1
singing	1
still	1
shall	1
hold	1
its	1
way,	1
And	1
make	1
the	1
waters	1
of	1
oblivion	1
stay.	1
At	1
this	1
point	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
two	1
that	1
looked	1
like	1
kings	1
exclaimed,	1
“Enough,	1
enough,	1
divine	1
singer!	1
It	1
would	1
be	1
an	1
endless	1
task	1
to	1
put	1
before	1
us	1
now	1
the	1
death	1
and	1
the	1
charms	1
of	1
the	1
peerless	1
Altisidora,	1
not	1
dead	1
as	1
the	1
ignorant	1
world	1
imagines,	1
but	1
living	1
in	1
the	1
voice	1
of	1
fame	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
penance	1
which	1
Sancho	1
Panza,	1
here	1
present,	1
has	1
to	1
undergo	1
to	1
restore	1
her	1
to	1
the	1
long-lost	1
light.	1
Do	1
thou,	1
therefore,	1
O	1
Rhadamanthus,	1
who	1
sittest	1
in	1
judgment	1
with	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
murky	1
caverns	1
of	1
Dis,	1
as	1
thou	1
knowest	1
all	1
that	1
the	1
inscrutable	1
fates	1
have	1
decreed	1
touching	1
the	1
resuscitation	1
of	1
this	1
damsel,	1
announce	1
and	1
declare	1
it	1
at	1
once,	1
that	1
the	1
happiness	1
we	1
look	1
forward	1
to	1
from	1
her	1
restoration	1
be	1
no	1
longer	1
deferred.”	1
No	1
sooner	1
had	1
Minos	1
the	1
fellow	1
judge	1
of	1
Rhadamanthus	1
said	1
this,	1
than	1
Rhadamanthus	1
rising	1
up	1
said:	1
“Ho,	1
officials	1
of	1
this	1
house,	1
high	1
and	1
low,	1
great	1
and	1
small,	1
make	1
haste	1
hither	1
one	1
and	1
all,	1
and	1
print	1
on	1
Sancho’s	1
face	1
four-and-twenty	1
smacks,	1
and	1
give	1
him	1
twelve	1
pinches	1
and	1
six	1
pin	1
thrusts	1
in	1
the	1
back	1
and	1
arms;	1
for	1
upon	1
this	1
ceremony	1
depends	1
the	1
restoration	1
of	1
Altisidora.”	1
On	1
hearing	1
this	1
Sancho	1
broke	1
silence	1
and	1
cried	1
out,	1
“By	1
all	1
that’s	1
good,	1
I’ll	1
as	1
soon	1
let	1
my	1
face	1
be	1
smacked	1
or	1
handled	1
as	1
turn	1
Moor.	1
Body	1
o’	1
me!	1
What	1
has	1
handling	1
my	1
face	1
got	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
the	1
resurrection	1
of	1
this	1
damsel?	1
‘The	1
old	1
woman	1
took	1
kindly	1
to	1
the	1
blits;	1
they	1
enchant	1
Dulcinea,	1
and	1
whip	1
me	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
disenchant	1
her;	1
Altisidora	1
dies	1
of	1
ailments	1
God	1
was	1
pleased	1
to	1
send	1
her,	1
and	1
to	1
bring	1
her	1
to	1
life	1
again	1
they	1
must	1
give	1
me	1
four-and-twenty	1
smacks,	1
and	1
prick	1
holes	1
in	1
my	1
body	1
with	1
pins,	1
and	1
raise	1
weals	1
on	1
my	1
arms	1
with	1
pinches!	1
Try	1
those	1
jokes	1
on	1
a	1
brother-in-law;	1
‘I’m	1
an	1
old	1
dog,	1
and	1
“tus,	1
tus”	1
is	1
no	1
use	1
with	1
me.’”	1
“Thou	1
shalt	1
die,”	1
said	1
Rhadamanthus	1
in	1
a	1
loud	1
voice;	1
“relent,	1
thou	1
tiger;	1
humble	1
thyself,	1
proud	1
Nimrod;	1
suffer	1
and	1
he	1
silent,	1
for	1
no	1
impossibilities	1
are	1
asked	1
of	1
thee;	1
it	1
is	1
not	1
for	1
thee	1
to	1
inquire	1
into	1
the	1
difficulties	1
in	1
this	1
matter;	1
smacked	1
thou	1
must	1
be,	1
pricked	1
thou	1
shalt	1
see	1
thyself,	1
and	1
with	1
pinches	1
thou	1
must	1
be	1
made	1
to	1
howl.	1
Ho,	1
I	1
say,	1
officials,	1
obey	1
my	1
orders;	1
or	1
by	1
the	1
word	1
of	1
an	1
honest	1
man,	1
ye	1
shall	1
see	1
what	1
ye	1
were	1
born	1
for.”	1
At	1
this	1
some	1
six	1
duennas,	1
advancing	1
across	1
the	1
court,	1
made	1
their	1
appearance	1
in	1
procession,	1
one	1
after	1
the	1
other,	1
four	1
of	1
them	1
with	1
spectacles,	1
and	1
all	1
with	1
their	1
right	1
hands	1
uplifted,	1
showing	1
four	1
fingers	1
of	1
wrist	1
to	1
make	1
their	1
hands	1
look	1
longer,	1
as	1
is	1
the	1
fashion	1
now-a-days.	1
No	1
sooner	1
had	1
Sancho	1
caught	1
sight	1
of	1
them	1
than,	1
bellowing	1
like	1
a	1
bull,	1
he	1
exclaimed,	1
“I	1
might	1
let	1
myself	1
be	1
handled	1
by	1
all	1
the	1
world;	1
but	1
allow	1
duennas	1
to	1
touch	1
me—not	1
a	1
bit	1
of	1
it!	1
Scratch	1
my	1
face,	1
as	1
my	1
master	1
was	1
served	1
in	1
this	1
very	1
castle;	1
run	1
me	1
through	1
the	1
body	1
with	1
burnished	1
daggers;	1
pinch	1
my	1
arms	1
with	1
red-hot	1
pincers;	1
I’ll	1
bear	1
all	1
in	1
patience	1
to	1
serve	1
these	1
gentlefolk;	1
but	1
I	1
won’t	1
let	1
duennas	1
touch	1
me,	1
though	1
the	1
devil	1
should	1
carry	1
me	1
off!”	1
Here	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
too,	1
broke	1
silence,	1
saying	1
to	1
Sancho,	1
“Have	1
patience,	1
my	1
son,	1
and	1
gratify	1
these	1
noble	1
persons,	1
and	1
give	1
all	1
thanks	1
to	1
heaven	1
that	1
it	1
has	1
infused	1
such	1
virtue	1
into	1
thy	1
person,	1
that	1
by	1
its	1
sufferings	1
thou	1
canst	1
disenchant	1
the	1
enchanted	1
and	1
restore	1
to	1
life	1
the	1
dead.”	1
The	1
duennas	1
were	1
now	1
close	1
to	1
Sancho,	1
and	1
he,	1
having	1
become	1
more	1
tractable	1
and	1
reasonable,	1
settling	1
himself	1
well	1
in	1
his	1
chair	1
presented	1
his	1
face	1
and	1
beard	1
to	1
the	1
first,	1
who	1
delivered	1
him	1
a	1
smack	1
very	1
stoutly	1
laid	1
on,	1
and	1
then	1
made	1
him	1
a	1
low	1
curtsey.	1
“Less	1
politeness	1
and	1
less	1
paint,	1
señora	1
duenna,”	1
said	1
Sancho;	1
“by	1
God	1
your	1
hands	1
smell	1
of	1
vinegar-wash.”	1
In	1
line,	1
all	1
the	1
duennas	1
smacked	1
him	1
and	1
several	1
others	1
of	1
the	1
household	1
pinched	1
him;	1
but	1
what	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
stand	1
was	1
being	1
pricked	1
by	1
the	1
pins;	1
and	1
so,	1
apparently	1
out	1
of	1
patience,	1
he	1
started	1
up	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
chair,	1
and	1
seizing	1
a	1
lighted	1
torch	1
that	1
stood	1
near	1
him	1
fell	1
upon	1
the	1
duennas	1
and	1
the	1
whole	1
set	1
of	1
his	1
tormentors,	1
exclaiming,	1
“Begone,	1
ye	1
ministers	1
of	1
hell;	1
I’m	1
not	1
made	1
of	1
brass	1
not	1
to	1
feel	1
such	1
out-of-the-way	1
tortures.”	1
At	1
this	1
instant	1
Altisidora,	1
who	1
probably	1
was	1
tired	1
of	1
having	1
been	1
so	1
long	1
lying	1
on	1
her	1
back,	1
turned	1
on	1
her	1
side;	1
seeing	1
which	1
the	1
bystanders	1
cried	1
out	1
almost	1
with	1
one	1
voice,	1
“Altisidora	1
is	1
alive!	1
Altisidora	1
lives!”	1
Rhadamanthus	1
bade	1
Sancho	1
put	1
away	1
his	1
wrath,	1
as	1
the	1
object	1
they	1
had	1
in	1
view	1
was	1
now	1
attained.	1
When	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
saw	1
Altisidora	1
move,	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
his	1
knees	1
to	1
Sancho	1
saying	1
to	1
him,	1
“Now	1
is	1
the	1
time,	1
son	1
of	1
my	1
bowels,	1
not	1
to	1
call	1
thee	1
my	1
squire,	1
for	1
thee	1
to	1
give	1
thyself	1
some	1
of	1
those	1
lashes	1
thou	1
art	1
bound	1
to	1
lay	1
on	1
for	1
the	1
disenchantment	1
of	1
Dulcinea.	1
Now,	1
I	1
say,	1
is	1
the	1
time	1
when	1
the	1
virtue	1
that	1
is	1
in	1
thee	1
is	1
ripe,	1
and	1
endowed	1
with	1
efficacy	1
to	1
work	1
the	1
good	1
that	1
is	1
looked	1
for	1
from	1
thee.”	1
To	1
which	1
Sancho	1
made	1
answer,	1
“That’s	1
trick	1
upon	1
trick,	1
I	1
think,	1
and	1
not	1
honey	1
upon	1
pancakes;	1
a	1
nice	1
thing	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
for	1
a	1
whipping	1
to	1
come	1
now,	1
on	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
pinches,	1
smacks,	1
and	1
pin-proddings!	1
You	1
had	1
better	1
take	1
a	1
big	1
stone	1
and	1
tie	1
it	1
round	1
my	1
neck,	1
and	1
pitch	1
me	1
into	1
a	1
well;	1
I	1
should	1
not	1
mind	1
it	1
much,	1
if	1
I’m	1
to	1
be	1
always	1
made	1
the	1
cow	1
of	1
the	1
wedding	1
for	1
the	1
cure	1
of	1
other	1
people’s	1
ailments.	1
Leave	1
me	1
alone;	1
or	1
else	1
by	1
God	1
I’ll	1
fling	1
the	1
whole	1
thing	1
to	1
the	1
dogs,	1
let	1
come	1
what	1
may.”	1
Altisidora	1
had	1
by	1
this	1
time	1
sat	1
up	1
on	1
the	1
catafalque,	1
and	1
as	1
she	1
did	1
so	1
the	1
clarions	1
sounded,	1
accompanied	1
by	1
the	1
flutes,	1
and	1
the	1
voices	1
of	1
all	1
present	1
exclaiming,	1
“Long	1
life	1
to	1
Altisidora!	1
long	1
life	1
to	1
Altisidora!”	1
The	1
duke	1
and	1
duchess	1
and	1
the	1
kings	1
Minos	1
and	1
Rhadamanthus	1
stood	1
up,	1
and	1
all,	1
together	1
with	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
and	1
Sancho,	1
advanced	1
to	1
receive	1
her	1
and	1
take	1
her	1
down	1
from	1
the	1
catafalque;	1
and	1
she,	1
making	1
as	1
though	1
she	1
were	1
recovering	1
from	1
a	1
swoon,	1
bowed	1
her	1
head	1
to	1
the	1
duke	1
and	1
duchess	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
kings,	1
and	1
looking	1
sideways	1
at	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
said	1
to	1
him,	1
“God	1
forgive	1
thee,	1
insensible	1
knight,	1
for	1
through	1
thy	1
cruelty	1
I	1
have	1
been,	1
to	1
me	1
it	1
seems,	1
more	1
than	1
a	1
thousand	1
years	1
in	1
the	1
other	1
world;	1
and	1
to	1
thee,	1
the	1
most	1
compassionate	1
upon	1
earth,	1
I	1
render	1
thanks	1
for	1
the	1
life	1
I	1
am	1
now	1
in	1
possession	1
of.	1
From	1
this	1
day	1
forth,	1
friend	1
Sancho,	1
count	1
as	1
thine	1
six	1
smocks	1
of	1
mine	1
which	1
I	1
bestow	1
upon	1
thee,	1
to	1
make	1
as	1
many	1
shirts	1
for	1
thyself,	1
and	1
if	1
they	1
are	1
not	1
all	1
quite	1
whole,	1
at	1
any	1
rate	1
they	1
are	1
all	1
clean.”	1
Sancho	1
kissed	1
her	1
hands	1
in	1
gratitude,	1
kneeling,	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
mitre	1
in	1
his	1
hand.	1
The	1
duke	1
bade	1
them	1
take	1
it	1
from	1
him,	1
and	1
give	1
him	1
back	1
his	1
cap	1
and	1
doublet	1
and	1
remove	1
the	1
flaming	1
robe.	1
Sancho	1
begged	1
the	1
duke	1
to	1
let	1
them	1
leave	1
him	1
the	1
robe	1
and	1
mitre;	1
as	1
he	1
wanted	1
to	1
take	1
them	1
home	1
for	1
a	1
token	1
and	1
memento	1
of	1
that	1
unexampled	1
adventure.	1
The	1
duchess	1
said	1
they	1
must	1
leave	1
them	1
with	1
him;	1
for	1
he	1
knew	1
already	1
what	1
a	1
great	1
friend	1
of	1
his	1
she	1
was.	1
The	1
duke	1
then	1
gave	1
orders	1
that	1
the	1
court	1
should	1
be	1
cleared,	1
and	1
that	1
all	1
should	1
retire	1
to	1
their	1
chambers,	1
and	1
that	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
and	1
Sancho	1
should	1
be	1
conducted	1
to	1
their	1
old	1
quarters.	1

Sancho	1
slept	1
that	1
night	1
in	1
a	1
cot	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
chamber	1
with	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
a	1
thing	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
gladly	1
excused	1
if	1
he	1
could	1
for	1
he	1
knew	1
very	1
well	1
that	1
with	1
questions	1
and	1
answers	1
his	1
master	1
would	1
not	1
let	1
him	1
sleep,	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
no	1
humour	1
for	1
talking	1
much,	1
as	1
he	1
still	1
felt	1
the	1
pain	1
of	1
his	1
late	1
martyrdom,	1
which	1
interfered	1
with	1
his	1
freedom	1
of	1
speech;	1
and	1
it	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
more	1
to	1
his	1
taste	1
to	1
sleep	1
in	1
a	1
hovel	1
alone,	1
than	1
in	1
that	1
luxurious	1
chamber	1
in	1
company.	1
And	1
so	1
well	1
founded	1
did	1
his	1
apprehension	1
prove,	1
and	1
so	1
correct	1
was	1
his	1
anticipation,	1
that	1
scarcely	1
had	1
his	1
master	1
got	1
into	1
bed	1
when	1
he	1
said,	1
“What	1
dost	1
thou	1
think	1
of	1
to-night’s	1
adventure,	1
Sancho?	1
Great	1
and	1
mighty	1
is	1
the	1
power	1
of	1
cold-hearted	1
scorn,	1
for	1
thou	1
with	1
thine	1
own	1
eyes	1
hast	1
seen	1
Altisidora	1
slain,	1
not	1
by	1
arrows,	1
nor	1
by	1
the	1
sword,	1
nor	1
by	1
any	1
warlike	1
weapon,	1
nor	1
by	1
deadly	1
poisons,	1
but	1
by	1
the	1
thought	1
of	1
the	1
sternness	1
and	1
scorn	1
with	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
always	1
treated	1
her.”	1
“She	1
might	1
have	1
died	1
and	1
welcome,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“when	1
she	1
pleased	1
and	1
how	1
she	1
pleased;	1
and	1
she	1
might	1
have	1
left	1
me	1
alone,	1
for	1
I	1
never	1
made	1
her	1
fall	1
in	1
love	1
or	1
scorned	1
her.	1
I	1
don’t	1
know	1
nor	1
can	1
I	1
imagine	1
how	1
the	1
recovery	1
of	1
Altisidora,	1
a	1
damsel	1
more	1
fanciful	1
than	1
wise,	1
can	1
have,	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
said	1
before,	1
anything	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
the	1
sufferings	1
of	1
Sancho	1
Panza.	1
Now	1
I	1
begin	1
to	1
see	1
plainly	1
and	1
clearly	1
that	1
there	1
are	1
enchanters	1
and	1
enchanted	1
people	1
in	1
the	1
world;	1
and	1
may	1
God	1
deliver	1
me	1
from	1
them,	1
since	1
I	1
can’t	1
deliver	1
myself;	1
and	1
so	1
I	1
beg	1
of	1
your	1
worship	1
to	1
let	1
me	1
sleep	1
and	1
not	1
ask	1
me	1
any	1
more	1
questions,	1
unless	1
you	1
want	1
me	1
to	1
throw	1
myself	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
window.”	1
“Sleep,	1
Sancho	1
my	1
friend,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“if	1
the	1
pinprodding	1
and	1
pinches	1
thou	1
hast	1
received	1
and	1
the	1
smacks	1
administered	1
to	1
thee	1
will	1
let	1
thee.”	1
“No	1
pain	1
came	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
insult	1
of	1
the	1
smacks,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“for	1
the	1
simple	1
reason	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
duennas,	1
confound	1
them,	1
that	1
gave	1
them	1
to	1
me;	1
but	1
once	1
more	1
I	1
entreat	1
your	1
worship	1
to	1
let	1
me	1
sleep,	1
for	1
sleep	1
is	1
relief	1
from	1
misery	1
to	1
those	1
who	1
are	1
miserable	1
when	1
awake.”	1
“Be	1
it	1
so,	1
and	1
God	1
be	1
with	1
thee,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote.	1
They	1
fell	1
asleep,	1
both	1
of	1
them,	1
and	1
Cide	1
Hamete,	1
the	1
author	1
of	1
this	1
great	1
history,	1
took	1
this	1
opportunity	1
to	1
record	1
and	1
relate	1
what	1
it	1
was	1
that	1
induced	1
the	1
duke	1
and	1
duchess	1
to	1
get	1
up	1
the	1
elaborate	1
plot	1
that	1
has	1
been	1
described.	1
The	1
bachelor	1
Samson	1
Carrasco,	1
he	1
says,	1
not	1
forgetting	1
how	1
he	1
as	1
the	1
Knight	1
of	1
the	1
Mirrors	1
had	1
been	1
vanquished	1
and	1
overthrown	1
by	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
which	1
defeat	1
and	1
overthrow	1
upset	1
all	1
his	1
plans,	1
resolved	1
to	1
try	1
his	1
hand	1
again,	1
hoping	1
for	1
better	1
luck	1
than	1
he	1
had	1
before;	1
and	1
so,	1
having	1
learned	1
where	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
was	1
from	1
the	1
page	1
who	1
brought	1
the	1
letter	1
and	1
present	1
to	1
Sancho’s	1
wife,	1
Teresa	1
Panza,	1
he	1
got	1
himself	1
new	1
armour	1
and	1
another	1
horse,	1
and	1
put	1
a	1
white	1
moon	1
upon	1
his	1
shield,	1
and	1
to	1
carry	1
his	1
arms	1
he	1
had	1
a	1
mule	1
led	1
by	1
a	1
peasant,	1
not	1
by	1
Tom	1
Cecial	1
his	1
former	1
squire	1
for	1
fear	1
he	1
should	1
be	1
recognised	1
by	1
Sancho	1
or	1
Don	1
Quixote.	1
He	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
duke’s	1
castle,	1
and	1
the	1
duke	1
informed	1
him	1
of	1
the	1
road	1
and	1
route	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
had	1
taken	1
with	1
the	1
intention	1
of	1
being	1
present	1
at	1
the	1
jousts	1
at	1
Saragossa.	1
He	1
told	1
him,	1
too,	1
of	1
the	1
jokes	1
he	1
had	1
practised	1
upon	1
him,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
device	1
for	1
the	1
disenchantment	1
of	1
Dulcinea	1
at	1
the	1
expense	1
of	1
Sancho’s	1
backside;	1
and	1
finally	1
he	1
gave	1
him	1
an	1
account	1
of	1
the	1
trick	1
Sancho	1
had	1
played	1
upon	1
his	1
master,	1
making	1
him	1
believe	1
that	1
Dulcinea	1
was	1
enchanted	1
and	1
turned	1
into	1
a	1
country	1
wench;	1
and	1
of	1
how	1
the	1
duchess,	1
his	1
wife,	1
had	1
persuaded	1
Sancho	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
he	1
himself	1
who	1
was	1
deceived,	1
inasmuch	1
as	1
Dulcinea	1
was	1
really	1
enchanted;	1
at	1
which	1
the	1
bachelor	1
laughed	1
not	1
a	1
little,	1
and	1
marvelled	1
as	1
well	1
at	1
the	1
sharpness	1
and	1
simplicity	1
of	1
Sancho	1
as	1
at	1
the	1
length	1
to	1
which	1
Don	1
Quixote’s	1
madness	1
went.	1
The	1
duke	1
begged	1
of	1
him	1
if	1
he	1
found	1
him	1
(whether	1
he	1
overcame	1
him	1
or	1
not)	1
to	1
return	1
that	1
way	1
and	1
let	1
him	1
know	1
the	1
result.	1
This	1
the	1
bachelor	1
did;	1
he	1
set	1
out	1
in	1
quest	1
of	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
and	1
not	1
finding	1
him	1
at	1
Saragossa,	1
he	1
went	1
on,	1
and	1
how	1
he	1
fared	1
has	1
been	1
already	1
told.	1
He	1
returned	1
to	1
the	1
duke’s	1
castle	1
and	1
told	1
him	1
all,	1
what	1
the	1
conditions	1
of	1
the	1
combat	1
were,	1
and	1
how	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
was	1
now,	1
like	1
a	1
loyal	1
knight-errant,	1
returning	1
to	1
keep	1
his	1
promise	1
of	1
retiring	1
to	1
his	1
village	1
for	1
a	1
year,	1
by	1
which	1
time,	1
said	1
the	1
bachelor,	1
he	1
might	1
perhaps	1
be	1
cured	1
of	1
his	1
madness;	1
for	1
that	1
was	1
the	1
object	1
that	1
had	1
led	1
him	1
to	1
adopt	1
these	1
disguises,	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
sad	1
thing	1
for	1
a	1
gentleman	1
of	1
such	1
good	1
parts	1
as	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
madman.	1
And	1
so	1
he	1
took	1
his	1
leave	1
of	1
the	1
duke,	1
and	1
went	1
home	1
to	1
his	1
village	1
to	1
wait	1
there	1
for	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
who	1
was	1
coming	1
after	1
him.	1
Thereupon	1
the	1
duke	1
seized	1
the	1
opportunity	1
of	1
practising	1
this	1
mystification	1
upon	1
him;	1
so	1
much	1
did	1
he	1
enjoy	1
everything	1
connected	1
with	1
Sancho	1
and	1
Don	1
Quixote.	1
He	1
had	1
the	1
roads	1
about	1
the	1
castle	1
far	1
and	1
near,	1
everywhere	1
he	1
thought	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
was	1
likely	1
to	1
pass	1
on	1
his	1
return,	1
occupied	1
by	1
large	1
numbers	1
of	1
his	1
servants	1
on	1
foot	1
and	1
on	1
horseback,	1
who	1
were	1
to	1
bring	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
castle,	1
by	1
fair	1
means	1
or	1
foul,	1
if	1
they	1
met	1
him.	1
They	1
did	1
meet	1
him,	1
and	1
sent	1
word	1
to	1
the	1
duke,	1
who,	1
having	1
already	1
settled	1
what	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
done,	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
heard	1
of	1
his	1
arrival,	1
ordered	1
the	1
torches	1
and	1
lamps	1
in	1
the	1
court	1
to	1
be	1
lit	1
and	1
Altisidora	1
to	1
be	1
placed	1
on	1
the	1
catafalque	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
pomp	1
and	1
ceremony	1
that	1
has	1
been	1
described,	1
the	1
whole	1
affair	1
being	1
so	1
well	1
arranged	1
and	1
acted	1
that	1
it	1
differed	1
but	1
little	1
from	1
reality.	1
And	1
Cide	1
Hamete	1
says,	1
moreover,	1
that	1
for	1
his	1
part	1
he	1
considers	1
the	1
concocters	1
of	1
the	1
joke	1
as	1
crazy	1
as	1
the	1
victims	1
of	1
it,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
duke	1
and	1
duchess	1
were	1
not	1
two	1
fingers’	1
breadth	1
removed	1
from	1
being	1
something	1
like	1
fools	1
themselves	1
when	1
they	1
took	1
such	1
pains	1
to	1
make	1
game	1
of	1
a	1
pair	1
of	1
fools.	1
As	1
for	1
the	1
latter,	1
one	1
was	1
sleeping	1
soundly	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
lying	1
awake	1
occupied	1
with	1
his	1
desultory	1
thoughts,	1
when	1
daylight	1
came	1
to	1
them	1
bringing	1
with	1
it	1
the	1
desire	1
to	1
rise;	1
for	1
the	1
lazy	1
down	1
was	1
never	1
a	1
delight	1
to	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
victor	1
or	1
vanquished.	1
Altisidora,	1
come	1
back	1
from	1
death	1
to	1
life	1
as	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
fancied,	1
following	1
up	1
the	1
freak	1
of	1
her	1
lord	1
and	1
lady,	1
entered	1
the	1
chamber,	1
crowned	1
with	1
the	1
garland	1
she	1
had	1
worn	1
on	1
the	1
catafalque	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
robe	1
of	1
white	1
taffeta	1
embroidered	1
with	1
gold	1
flowers,	1
her	1
hair	1
flowing	1
loose	1
over	1
her	1
shoulders,	1
and	1
leaning	1
upon	1
a	1
staff	1
of	1
fine	1
black	1
ebony.	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
disconcerted	1
and	1
in	1
confusion	1
at	1
her	1
appearance,	1
huddled	1
himself	1
up	1
and	1
well-nigh	1
covered	1
himself	1
altogether	1
with	1
the	1
sheets	1
and	1
counterpane	1
of	1
the	1
bed,	1
tongue-tied,	1
and	1
unable	1
to	1
offer	1
her	1
any	1
civility.	1
Altisidora	1
seated	1
herself	1
on	1
a	1
chair	1
at	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
bed,	1
and,	1
after	1
a	1
deep	1
sigh,	1
said	1
to	1
him	1
in	1
a	1
feeble,	1
soft	1
voice,	1
“When	1
women	1
of	1
rank	1
and	1
modest	1
maidens	1
trample	1
honour	1
under	1
foot,	1
and	1
give	1
a	1
loose	1
to	1
the	1
tongue	1
that	1
breaks	1
through	1
every	1
impediment,	1
publishing	1
abroad	1
the	1
inmost	1
secrets	1
of	1
their	1
hearts,	1
they	1
are	1
reduced	1
to	1
sore	1
extremities.	1
Such	1
a	1
one	1
am	1
I,	1
Señor	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
of	1
La	1
Mancha,	1
crushed,	1
conquered,	1
love-smitten,	1
but	1
yet	1
patient	1
under	1
suffering	1
and	1
virtuous,	1
and	1
so	1
much	1
so	1
that	1
my	1
heart	1
broke	1
with	1
grief	1
and	1
I	1
lost	1
my	1
life.	1
For	1
the	1
last	1
two	1
days	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
dead,	1
slain	1
by	1
the	1
thought	1
of	1
the	1
cruelty	1
with	1
which	1
thou	1
hast	1
treated	1
me,	1
obdurate	1
knight,	1
O	1
harder	1
thou	1
than	1
marble	1
to	1
my	1
plaint;	1
or	1
at	1
least	1
believed	1
to	1
be	1
dead	1
by	1
all	1
who	1
saw	1
me;	1
and	1
had	1
it	1
not	1
been	1
that	1
Love,	1
taking	1
pity	1
on	1
me,	1
let	1
my	1
recovery	1
rest	1
upon	1
the	1
sufferings	1
of	1
this	1
good	1
squire,	1
there	1
I	1
should	1
have	1
remained	1
in	1
the	1
other	1
world.”	1
“Love	1
might	1
very	1
well	1
have	1
let	1
it	1
rest	1
upon	1
the	1
sufferings	1
of	1
my	1
ass,	1
and	1
I	1
should	1
have	1
been	1
obliged	1
to	1
him,”	1
said	1
Sancho.	1
“But	1
tell	1
me,	1
señora—and	1
may	1
heaven	1
send	1
you	1
a	1
tenderer	1
lover	1
than	1
my	1
master—what	1
did	1
you	1
see	1
in	1
the	1
other	1
world?	1
What	1
goes	1
on	1
in	1
hell?	1
For	1
of	1
course	1
that’s	1
where	1
one	1
who	1
dies	1
in	1
despair	1
is	1
bound	1
for.”	1
“To	1
tell	1
you	1
the	1
truth,”	1
said	1
Altisidora,	1
“I	1
cannot	1
have	1
died	1
outright,	1
for	1
I	1
did	1
not	1
go	1
into	1
hell;	1
had	1
I	1
gone	1
in,	1
it	1
is	1
very	1
certain	1
I	1
should	1
never	1
have	1
come	1
out	1
again,	1
do	1
what	1
I	1
might.	1
The	1
truth	1
is,	1
I	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
gate,	1
where	1
some	1
dozen	1
or	1
so	1
of	1
devils	1
were	1
playing	1
tennis,	1
all	1
in	1
breeches	1
and	1
doublets,	1
with	1
falling	1
collars	1
trimmed	1
with	1
Flemish	1
bonelace,	1
and	1
ruffles	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
that	1
served	1
them	1
for	1
wristbands,	1
with	1
four	1
fingers’	1
breadth	1
of	1
the	1
arms	1
exposed	1
to	1
make	1
their	1
hands	1
look	1
longer;	1
in	1
their	1
hands	1
they	1
held	1
rackets	1
of	1
fire;	1
but	1
what	1
amazed	1
me	1
still	1
more	1
was	1
that	1
books,	1
apparently	1
full	1
of	1
wind	1
and	1
rubbish,	1
served	1
them	1
for	1
tennis	1
balls,	1
a	1
strange	1
and	1
marvellous	1
thing;	1
this,	1
however,	1
did	1
not	1
astonish	1
me	1
so	1
much	1
as	1
to	1
observe	1
that,	1
although	1
with	1
players	1
it	1
is	1
usual	1
for	1
the	1
winners	1
to	1
be	1
glad	1
and	1
the	1
losers	1
sorry,	1
there	1
in	1
that	1
game	1
all	1
were	1
growling,	1
all	1
were	1
snarling,	1
and	1
all	1
were	1
cursing	1
one	1
another.”	1
“That’s	1
no	1
wonder,”	1
said	1
Sancho;	1
“for	1
devils,	1
whether	1
playing	1
or	1
not,	1
can	1
never	1
be	1
content,	1
win	1
or	1
lose.”	1
“Very	1
likely,”	1
said	1
Altisidora;	1
“but	1
there	1
is	1
another	1
thing	1
that	1
surprises	1
me	1
too,	1
I	1
mean	1
surprised	1
me	1
then,	1
and	1
that	1
was	1
that	1
no	1
ball	1
outlasted	1
the	1
first	1
throw	1
or	1
was	1
of	1
any	1
use	1
a	1
second	1
time;	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
wonderful	1
the	1
constant	1
succession	1
there	1
was	1
of	1
books,	1
new	1
and	1
old.	1
To	1
one	1
of	1
them,	1
a	1
brand-new,	1
well-bound	1
one,	1
they	1
gave	1
such	1
a	1
stroke	1
that	1
they	1
knocked	1
the	1
guts	1
out	1
of	1
it	1
and	1
scattered	1
the	1
leaves	1
about.	1
‘Look	1
what	1
book	1
that	1
is,’	1
said	1
one	1
devil	1
to	1
another,	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
replied,	1
‘It	1
is	1
the	1
“Second	1
Part	1
of	1
the	1
History	1
of	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
of	1
La	1
Mancha,”	1
not	1
by	1
Cide	1
Hamete,	1
the	1
original	1
author,	1
but	1
by	1
an	1
Aragonese	1
who	1
by	1
his	1
own	1
account	1
is	1
of	1
Tordesillas.’	1
‘Out	1
of	1
this	1
with	1
it,’	1
said	1
the	1
first,	1
‘and	1
into	1
the	1
depths	1
of	1
hell	1
with	1
it	1
out	1
of	1
my	1
sight.’	1
‘Is	1
it	1
so	1
bad?’	1
said	1
the	1
other.	1
‘So	1
bad	1
is	1
it,’	1
said	1
the	1
first,	1
‘that	1
if	1
I	1
had	1
set	1
myself	1
deliberately	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
worse,	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
done	1
it.’	1
They	1
then	1
went	1
on	1
with	1
their	1
game,	1
knocking	1
other	1
books	1
about;	1
and	1
I,	1
having	1
heard	1
them	1
mention	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
whom	1
I	1
love	1
and	1
adore	1
so,	1
took	1
care	1
to	1
retain	1
this	1
vision	1
in	1
my	1
memory.”	1
“A	1
vision	1
it	1
must	1
have	1
been,	1
no	1
doubt,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“for	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
other	1
I	1
in	1
the	1
world;	1
this	1
history	1
has	1
been	1
going	1
about	1
here	1
for	1
some	1
time	1
from	1
hand	1
to	1
hand,	1
but	1
it	1
does	1
not	1
stay	1
long	1
in	1
any,	1
for	1
everybody	1
gives	1
it	1
a	1
taste	1
of	1
his	1
foot.	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
disturbed	1
by	1
hearing	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
wandering	1
in	1
a	1
fantastic	1
shape	1
in	1
the	1
darkness	1
of	1
the	1
pit	1
or	1
in	1
the	1
daylight	1
above,	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
the	1
one	1
that	1
history	1
treats	1
of.	1
If	1
it	1
should	1
be	1
good,	1
faithful,	1
and	1
true,	1
it	1
will	1
have	1
ages	1
of	1
life;	1
but	1
if	1
it	1
should	1
be	1
bad,	1
from	1
its	1
birth	1
to	1
its	1
burial	1
will	1
not	1
be	1
a	1
very	1
long	1
journey.”	1
Altisidora	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
proceed	1
with	1
her	1
complaint	1
against	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
when	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
her,	1
“I	1
have	1
several	1
times	1
told	1
you,	1
señora	1
that	1
it	1
grieves	1
me	1
you	1
should	1
have	1
set	1
your	1
affections	1
upon	1
me,	1
as	1
from	1
mine	1
they	1
can	1
only	1
receive	1
gratitude,	1
but	1
no	1
return.	1
I	1
was	1
born	1
to	1
belong	1
to	1
Dulcinea	1
del	1
Toboso,	1
and	1
the	1
fates,	1
if	1
there	1
are	1
any,	1
dedicated	1
me	1
to	1
her;	1
and	1
to	1
suppose	1
that	1
any	1
other	1
beauty	1
can	1
take	1
the	1
place	1
she	1
occupies	1
in	1
my	1
heart	1
is	1
to	1
suppose	1
an	1
impossibility.	1
This	1
frank	1
declaration	1
should	1
suffice	1
to	1
make	1
you	1
retire	1
within	1
the	1
bounds	1
of	1
your	1
modesty,	1
for	1
no	1
one	1
can	1
bind	1
himself	1
to	1
do	1
impossibilities.”	1
Hearing	1
this,	1
Altisidora,	1
with	1
a	1
show	1
of	1
anger	1
and	1
agitation,	1
exclaimed,	1
“God’s	1
life!	1
Don	1
Stockfish,	1
soul	1
of	1
a	1
mortar,	1
stone	1
of	1
a	1
date,	1
more	1
obstinate	1
and	1
obdurate	1
than	1
a	1
clown	1
asked	1
a	1
favour	1
when	1
he	1
has	1
his	1
mind	1
made	1
up,	1
if	1
I	1
fall	1
upon	1
you	1
I’ll	1
tear	1
your	1
eyes	1
out!	1
Do	1
you	1
fancy,	1
Don	1
Vanquished,	1
Don	1
Cudgelled,	1
that	1
I	1
died	1
for	1
your	1
sake?	1
All	1
that	1
you	1
have	1
seen	1
to-night	1
has	1
been	1
make-believe;	1
I’m	1
not	1
the	1
woman	1
to	1
let	1
the	1
black	1
of	1
my	1
nail	1
suffer	1
for	1
such	1
a	1
camel,	1
much	1
less	1
die!”	1
“That	1
I	1
can	1
well	1
believe,”	1
said	1
Sancho;	1
“for	1
all	1
that	1
about	1
lovers	1
pining	1
to	1
death	1
is	1
absurd;	1
they	1
may	1
talk	1
of	1
it,	1
but	1
as	1
for	1
doing	1
it—Judas	1
may	1
believe	1
that!”	1
While	1
they	1
were	1
talking,	1
the	1
musician,	1
singer,	1
and	1
poet,	1
who	1
had	1
sung	1
the	1
two	1
stanzas	1
given	1
above	1
came	1
in,	1
and	1
making	1
a	1
profound	1
obeisance	1
to	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
said,	1
“Will	1
your	1
worship,	1
sir	1
knight,	1
reckon	1
and	1
retain	1
me	1
in	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
your	1
most	1
faithful	1
servants,	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
long	1
been	1
a	1
great	1
admirer	1
of	1
yours,	1
as	1
well	1
because	1
of	1
your	1
fame	1
as	1
because	1
of	1
your	1
achievements?”	1
“Will	1
your	1
worship	1
tell	1
me	1
who	1
you	1
are,”	1
replied	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“so	1
that	1
my	1
courtesy	1
may	1
be	1
answerable	1
to	1
your	1
deserts?”	1
The	1
young	1
man	1
replied	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
the	1
musician	1
and	1
songster	1
of	1
the	1
night	1
before.	1
“Of	1
a	1
truth,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“your	1
worship	1
has	1
a	1
most	1
excellent	1
voice;	1
but	1
what	1
you	1
sang	1
did	1
not	1
seem	1
to	1
me	1
very	1
much	1
to	1
the	1
purpose;	1
for	1
what	1
have	1
Garcilasso’s	1
stanzas	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
the	1
death	1
of	1
this	1
lady?”	1
“Don’t	1
be	1
surprised	1
at	1
that,”	1
returned	1
the	1
musician;	1
“for	1
with	1
the	1
callow	1
poets	1
of	1
our	1
day	1
the	1
way	1
is	1
for	1
every	1
one	1
to	1
write	1
as	1
he	1
pleases	1
and	1
pilfer	1
where	1
he	1
chooses,	1
whether	1
it	1
be	1
germane	1
to	1
the	1
matter	1
or	1
not,	1
and	1
now-a-days	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
piece	1
of	1
silliness	1
they	1
can	1
sing	1
or	1
write	1
that	1
is	1
not	1
set	1
down	1
to	1
poetic	1
licence.”	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
reply,	1
but	1
was	1
prevented	1
by	1
the	1
duke	1
and	1
duchess,	1
who	1
came	1
in	1
to	1
see	1
him,	1
and	1
with	1
them	1
there	1
followed	1
a	1
long	1
and	1
delightful	1
conversation,	1
in	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
which	1
Sancho	1
said	1
so	1
many	1
droll	1
and	1
saucy	1
things	1
that	1
he	1
left	1
the	1
duke	1
and	1
duchess	1
wondering	1
not	1
only	1
at	1
his	1
simplicity	1
but	1
at	1
his	1
sharpness.	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
begged	1
their	1
permission	1
to	1
take	1
his	1
departure	1
that	1
same	1
day,	1
inasmuch	1
as	1
for	1
a	1
vanquished	1
knight	1
like	1
himself	1
it	1
was	1
fitter	1
he	1
should	1
live	1
in	1
a	1
pig-sty	1
than	1
in	1
a	1
royal	1
palace.	1
They	1
gave	1
it	1
very	1
readily,	1
and	1
the	1
duchess	1
asked	1
him	1
if	1
Altisidora	1
was	1
in	1
his	1
good	1
graces.	1
He	1
replied,	1
“Señora,	1
let	1
me	1
tell	1
your	1
ladyship	1
that	1
this	1
damsel’s	1
ailment	1
comes	1
entirely	1
of	1
idleness,	1
and	1
the	1
cure	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
honest	1
and	1
constant	1
employment.	1
She	1
herself	1
has	1
told	1
me	1
that	1
lace	1
is	1
worn	1
in	1
hell;	1
and	1
as	1
she	1
must	1
know	1
how	1
to	1
make	1
it,	1
let	1
it	1
never	1
be	1
out	1
of	1
her	1
hands;	1
for	1
when	1
she	1
is	1
occupied	1
in	1
shifting	1
the	1
bobbins	1
to	1
and	1
fro,	1
the	1
image	1
or	1
images	1
of	1
what	1
she	1
loves	1
will	1
not	1
shift	1
to	1
and	1
fro	1
in	1
her	1
thoughts;	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
truth,	1
this	1
is	1
my	1
opinion,	1
and	1
this	1
is	1
my	1
advice.”	1
“And	1
mine,”	1
added	1
Sancho;	1
“for	1
I	1
never	1
in	1
all	1
my	1
life	1
saw	1
a	1
lace-maker	1
that	1
died	1
for	1
love;	1
when	1
damsels	1
are	1
at	1
work	1
their	1
minds	1
are	1
more	1
set	1
on	1
finishing	1
their	1
tasks	1
than	1
on	1
thinking	1
of	1
their	1
loves.	1
I	1
speak	1
from	1
my	1
own	1
experience;	1
for	1
when	1
I’m	1
digging	1
I	1
never	1
think	1
of	1
my	1
old	1
woman;	1
I	1
mean	1
my	1
Teresa	1
Panza,	1
whom	1
I	1
love	1
better	1
than	1
my	1
own	1
eyelids.”	1
“You	1
say	1
well,	1
Sancho,”	1
said	1
the	1
duchess,	1
“and	1
I	1
will	1
take	1
care	1
that	1
my	1
Altisidora	1
employs	1
herself	1
henceforward	1
in	1
needlework	1
of	1
some	1
sort;	1
for	1
she	1
is	1
extremely	1
expert	1
at	1
it.”	1
“There	1
is	1
no	1
occasion	1
to	1
have	1
recourse	1
to	1
that	1
remedy,	1
señora,”	1
said	1
Altisidora;	1
“for	1
the	1
mere	1
thought	1
of	1
the	1
cruelty	1
with	1
which	1
this	1
vagabond	1
villain	1
has	1
treated	1
me	1
will	1
suffice	1
to	1
blot	1
him	1
out	1
of	1
my	1
memory	1
without	1
any	1
other	1
device;	1
with	1
your	1
highness’s	1
leave	1
I	1
will	1
retire,	1
not	1
to	1
have	1
before	1
my	1
eyes,	1
I	1
won’t	1
say	1
his	1
rueful	1
countenance,	1
but	1
his	1
abominable,	1
ugly	1
looks.”	1
“That	1
reminds	1
me	1
of	1
the	1
common	1
saying,	1
that	1
‘he	1
that	1
rails	1
is	1
ready	1
to	1
forgive,’”	1
said	1
the	1
duke.	1
Altisidora	1
then,	1
pretending	1
to	1
wipe	1
away	1
her	1
tears	1
with	1
a	1
handkerchief,	1
made	1
an	1
obeisance	1
to	1
her	1
master	1
and	1
mistress	1
and	1
quitted	1
the	1
room.	1
“Ill	1
luck	1
betide	1
thee,	1
poor	1
damsel,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“ill	1
luck	1
betide	1
thee!	1
Thou	1
hast	1
fallen	1
in	1
with	1
a	1
soul	1
as	1
dry	1
as	1
a	1
rush	1
and	1
a	1
heart	1
as	1
hard	1
as	1
oak;	1
had	1
it	1
been	1
me,	1
i’faith	1
‘another	1
cock	1
would	1
have	1
crowed	1
to	1
thee.’”	1
So	1
the	1
conversation	1
came	1
to	1
an	1
end,	1
and	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
dressed	1
himself	1
and	1
dined	1
with	1
the	1
duke	1
and	1
duchess,	1
and	1
set	1
out	1
the	1
same	1
evening.	1

The	1
vanquished	1
and	1
afflicted	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
went	1
along	1
very	1
downcast	1
in	1
one	1
respect	1
and	1
very	1
happy	1
in	1
another.	1
His	1
sadness	1
arose	1
from	1
his	1
defeat,	1
and	1
his	1
satisfaction	1
from	1
the	1
thought	1
of	1
the	1
virtue	1
that	1
lay	1
in	1
Sancho,	1
as	1
had	1
been	1
proved	1
by	1
the	1
resurrection	1
of	1
Altisidora;	1
though	1
it	1
was	1
with	1
difficulty	1
he	1
could	1
persuade	1
himself	1
that	1
the	1
love-smitten	1
damsel	1
had	1
been	1
really	1
dead.	1
Sancho	1
went	1
along	1
anything	1
but	1
cheerful,	1
for	1
it	1
grieved	1
him	1
that	1
Altisidora	1
had	1
not	1
kept	1
her	1
promise	1
of	1
giving	1
him	1
the	1
smocks;	1
and	1
turning	1
this	1
over	1
in	1
his	1
mind	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
his	1
master,	1
“Surely,	1
señor,	1
I’m	1
the	1
most	1
unlucky	1
doctor	1
in	1
the	1
world;	1
there’s	1
many	1
a	1
physician	1
that,	1
after	1
killing	1
the	1
sick	1
man	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
cure,	1
requires	1
to	1
be	1
paid	1
for	1
his	1
work,	1
though	1
it	1
is	1
only	1
signing	1
a	1
bit	1
of	1
a	1
list	1
of	1
medicines,	1
that	1
the	1
apothecary	1
and	1
not	1
he	1
makes	1
up,	1
and,	1
there,	1
his	1
labour	1
is	1
over;	1
but	1
with	1
me	1
though	1
to	1
cure	1
somebody	1
else	1
costs	1
me	1
drops	1
of	1
blood,	1
smacks,	1
pinches,	1
pinproddings,	1
and	1
whippings,	1
nobody	1
gives	1
me	1
a	1
farthing.	1
Well,	1
I	1
swear	1
by	1
all	1
that’s	1
good	1
if	1
they	1
put	1
another	1
patient	1
into	1
my	1
hands,	1
they’ll	1
have	1
to	1
grease	1
them	1
for	1
me	1
before	1
I	1
cure	1
him;	1
for,	1
as	1
they	1
say,	1
‘it’s	1
by	1
his	1
singing	1
the	1
abbot	1
gets	1
his	1
dinner,’	1
and	1
I’m	1
not	1
going	1
to	1
believe	1
that	1
heaven	1
has	1
bestowed	1
upon	1
me	1
the	1
virtue	1
I	1
have,	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
be	1
dealing	1
it	1
out	1
to	1
others	1
all	1
for	1
nothing.”	1
“Thou	1
art	1
right,	1
Sancho	1
my	1
friend,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“and	1
Altisidora	1
has	1
behaved	1
very	1
badly	1
in	1
not	1
giving	1
thee	1
the	1
smocks	1
she	1
promised;	1
and	1
although	1
that	1
virtue	1
of	1
thine	1
is	1
_gratis	1
data_—as	1
it	1
has	1
cost	1
thee	1
no	1
study	1
whatever,	1
any	1
more	1
than	1
such	1
study	1
as	1
thy	1
personal	1
sufferings	1
may	1
be—I	1
can	1
say	1
for	1
myself	1
that	1
if	1
thou	1
wouldst	1
have	1
payment	1
for	1
the	1
lashes	1
on	1
account	1
of	1
the	1
disenchant	1
of	1
Dulcinea,	1
I	1
would	1
have	1
given	1
it	1
to	1
thee	1
freely	1
ere	1
this.	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
sure,	1
however,	1
whether	1
payment	1
will	1
comport	1
with	1
the	1
cure,	1
and	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
the	1
reward	1
interfere	1
with	1
the	1
medicine.	1
I	1
think	1
there	1
will	1
be	1
nothing	1
lost	1
by	1
trying	1
it;	1
consider	1
how	1
much	1
thou	1
wouldst	1
have,	1
Sancho,	1
and	1
whip	1
thyself	1
at	1
once,	1
and	1
pay	1
thyself	1
down	1
with	1
thine	1
own	1
hand,	1
as	1
thou	1
hast	1
money	1
of	1
mine.”	1
At	1
this	1
proposal	1
Sancho	1
opened	1
his	1
eyes	1
and	1
his	1
ears	1
a	1
palm’s	1
breadth	1
wide,	1
and	1
in	1
his	1
heart	1
very	1
readily	1
acquiesced	1
in	1
whipping	1
himself,	1
and	1
said	1
he	1
to	1
his	1
master,	1
“Very	1
well	1
then,	1
señor,	1
I’ll	1
hold	1
myself	1
in	1
readiness	1
to	1
gratify	1
your	1
worship’s	1
wishes	1
if	1
I’m	1
to	1
profit	1
by	1
it;	1
for	1
the	1
love	1
of	1
my	1
wife	1
and	1
children	1
forces	1
me	1
to	1
seem	1
grasping.	1
Let	1
your	1
worship	1
say	1
how	1
much	1
you	1
will	1
pay	1
me	1
for	1
each	1
lash	1
I	1
give	1
myself.”	1
“If	1
Sancho,”	1
replied	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“I	1
were	1
to	1
requite	1
thee	1
as	1
the	1
importance	1
and	1
nature	1
of	1
the	1
cure	1
deserves,	1
the	1
treasures	1
of	1
Venice,	1
the	1
mines	1
of	1
Potosi,	1
would	1
be	1
insufficient	1
to	1
pay	1
thee.	1
See	1
what	1
thou	1
hast	1
of	1
mine,	1
and	1
put	1
a	1
price	1
on	1
each	1
lash.”	1
“Of	1
them,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“there	1
are	1
three	1
thousand	1
three	1
hundred	1
and	1
odd;	1
of	1
these	1
I	1
have	1
given	1
myself	1
five,	1
the	1
rest	1
remain;	1
let	1
the	1
five	1
go	1
for	1
the	1
odd	1
ones,	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
take	1
the	1
three	1
thousand	1
three	1
hundred,	1
which	1
at	1
a	1
quarter	1
real	1
apiece	1
(for	1
I	1
will	1
not	1
take	1
less	1
though	1
the	1
whole	1
world	1
should	1
bid	1
me)	1
make	1
three	1
thousand	1
three	1
hundred	1
quarter	1
reals;	1
the	1
three	1
thousand	1
are	1
one	1
thousand	1
five	1
hundred	1
half	1
reals,	1
which	1
make	1
seven	1
hundred	1
and	1
fifty	1
reals;	1
and	1
the	1
three	1
hundred	1
make	1
a	1
hundred	1
and	1
fifty	1
half	1
reals,	1
which	1
come	1
to	1
seventy-five	1
reals,	1
which	1
added	1
to	1
the	1
seven	1
hundred	1
and	1
fifty	1
make	1
eight	1
hundred	1
and	1
twenty-five	1
reals	1
in	1
all.	1
These	1
I	1
will	1
stop	1
out	1
of	1
what	1
I	1
have	1
belonging	1
to	1
your	1
worship,	1
and	1
I’ll	1
return	1
home	1
rich	1
and	1
content,	1
though	1
well	1
whipped,	1
for	1
‘there’s	1
no	1
taking	1
trout’—but	1
I	1
say	1
no	1
more.”	1
“O	1
blessed	1
Sancho!	1
O	1
dear	1
Sancho!”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
“how	1
we	1
shall	1
be	1
bound	1
to	1
serve	1
thee,	1
Dulcinea	1
and	1
I,	1
all	1
the	1
days	1
of	1
our	1
lives	1
that	1
heaven	1
may	1
grant	1
us!	1
If	1
she	1
returns	1
to	1
her	1
lost	1
shape	1
(and	1
it	1
cannot	1
be	1
but	1
that	1
she	1
will)	1
her	1
misfortune	1
will	1
have	1
been	1
good	1
fortune,	1
and	1
my	1
defeat	1
a	1
most	1
happy	1
triumph.	1
But	1
look	1
here,	1
Sancho;	1
when	1
wilt	1
thou	1
begin	1
the	1
scourging?	1
For	1
if	1
thou	1
wilt	1
make	1
short	1
work	1
of	1
it,	1
I	1
will	1
give	1
thee	1
a	1
hundred	1
reals	1
over	1
and	1
above.”	1
“When?”	1
said	1
Sancho;	1
“this	1
night	1
without	1
fail.	1
Let	1
your	1
worship	1
order	1
it	1
so	1
that	1
we	1
pass	1
it	1
out	1
of	1
doors	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
open	1
air,	1
and	1
I’ll	1
scarify	1
myself.”	1
Night,	1
longed	1
for	1
by	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
with	1
the	1
greatest	1
anxiety	1
in	1
the	1
world,	1
came	1
at	1
last,	1
though	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
the	1
wheels	1
of	1
Apollo’s	1
car	1
had	1
broken	1
down,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
day	1
was	1
drawing	1
itself	1
out	1
longer	1
than	1
usual,	1
just	1
as	1
is	1
the	1
case	1
with	1
lovers,	1
who	1
never	1
make	1
the	1
reckoning	1
of	1
their	1
desires	1
agree	1
with	1
time.	1
They	1
made	1
their	1
way	1
at	1
length	1
in	1
among	1
some	1
pleasant	1
trees	1
that	1
stood	1
a	1
little	1
distance	1
from	1
the	1
road,	1
and	1
there	1
vacating	1
Rocinante’s	1
saddle	1
and	1
Dapple’s	1
pack-saddle,	1
they	1
stretched	1
themselves	1
on	1
the	1
green	1
grass	1
and	1
made	1
their	1
supper	1
off	1
Sancho’s	1
stores,	1
and	1
he	1
making	1
a	1
powerful	1
and	1
flexible	1
whip	1
out	1
of	1
Dapple’s	1
halter	1
and	1
headstall	1
retreated	1
about	1
twenty	1
paces	1
from	1
his	1
master	1
among	1
some	1
beech	1
trees.	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
seeing	1
him	1
march	1
off	1
with	1
such	1
resolution	1
and	1
spirit,	1
said	1
to	1
him,	1
“Take	1
care,	1
my	1
friend,	1
not	1
to	1
cut	1
thyself	1
to	1
pieces;	1
allow	1
the	1
lashes	1
to	1
wait	1
for	1
one	1
another,	1
and	1
do	1
not	1
be	1
in	1
so	1
great	1
a	1
hurry	1
as	1
to	1
run	1
thyself	1
out	1
of	1
breath	1
midway;	1
I	1
mean,	1
do	1
not	1
lay	1
on	1
so	1
strenuously	1
as	1
to	1
make	1
thy	1
life	1
fail	1
thee	1
before	1
thou	1
hast	1
reached	1
the	1
desired	1
number;	1
and	1
that	1
thou	1
mayest	1
not	1
lose	1
by	1
a	1
card	1
too	1
much	1
or	1
too	1
little,	1
I	1
will	1
station	1
myself	1
apart	1
and	1
count	1
on	1
my	1
rosary	1
here	1
the	1
lashes	1
thou	1
givest	1
thyself.	1
May	1
heaven	1
help	1
thee	1
as	1
thy	1
good	1
intention	1
deserves.”	1
“‘Pledges	1
don’t	1
distress	1
a	1
good	1
payer,’”	1
said	1
Sancho;	1
“I	1
mean	1
to	1
lay	1
on	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
way	1
as	1
without	1
killing	1
myself	1
to	1
hurt	1
myself,	1
for	1
in	1
that,	1
no	1
doubt,	1
lies	1
the	1
essence	1
of	1
this	1
miracle.”	1
He	1
then	1
stripped	1
himself	1
from	1
the	1
waist	1
upwards,	1
and	1
snatching	1
up	1
the	1
rope	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
lay	1
on	1
and	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
to	1
count	1
the	1
lashes.	1
He	1
might	1
have	1
given	1
himself	1
six	1
or	1
eight	1
when	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
think	1
the	1
joke	1
no	1
trifle,	1
and	1
its	1
price	1
very	1
low;	1
and	1
holding	1
his	1
hand	1
for	1
a	1
moment,	1
he	1
told	1
his	1
master	1
that	1
he	1
cried	1
off	1
on	1
the	1
score	1
of	1
a	1
blind	1
bargain,	1
for	1
each	1
of	1
those	1
lashes	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
paid	1
for	1
at	1
the	1
rate	1
of	1
half	1
a	1
real	1
instead	1
of	1
a	1
quarter.	1
“Go	1
on,	1
Sancho	1
my	1
friend,	1
and	1
be	1
not	1
disheartened,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
“for	1
I	1
double	1
the	1
stakes	1
as	1
to	1
price.”	1
“In	1
that	1
case,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“in	1
God’s	1
hand	1
be	1
it,	1
and	1
let	1
it	1
rain	1
lashes.”	1
But	1
the	1
rogue	1
no	1
longer	1
laid	1
them	1
on	1
his	1
shoulders,	1
but	1
laid	1
on	1
to	1
the	1
trees,	1
with	1
such	1
groans	1
every	1
now	1
and	1
then,	1
that	1
one	1
would	1
have	1
thought	1
at	1
each	1
of	1
them	1
his	1
soul	1
was	1
being	1
plucked	1
up	1
by	1
the	1
roots.	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
touched	1
to	1
the	1
heart,	1
and	1
fearing	1
he	1
might	1
make	1
an	1
end	1
of	1
himself,	1
and	1
that	1
through	1
Sancho’s	1
imprudence	1
he	1
might	1
miss	1
his	1
own	1
object,	1
said	1
to	1
him,	1
“As	1
thou	1
livest,	1
my	1
friend,	1
let	1
the	1
matter	1
rest	1
where	1
it	1
is,	1
for	1
the	1
remedy	1
seems	1
to	1
me	1
a	1
very	1
rough	1
one,	1
and	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
well	1
to	1
have	1
patience;	1
‘Zamora	1
was	1
not	1
won	1
in	1
an	1
hour.’	1
If	1
I	1
have	1
not	1
reckoned	1
wrong	1
thou	1
hast	1
given	1
thyself	1
over	1
a	1
thousand	1
lashes;	1
that	1
is	1
enough	1
for	1
the	1
present;	1
‘for	1
the	1
ass,’	1
to	1
put	1
it	1
in	1
homely	1
phrase,	1
‘bears	1
the	1
load,	1
but	1
not	1
the	1
overload.’”	1
“No,	1
no,	1
señor,”	1
replied	1
Sancho;	1
“it	1
shall	1
never	1
be	1
said	1
of	1
me,	1
‘The	1
money	1
paid,	1
the	1
arms	1
broken;’	1
go	1
back	1
a	1
little	1
further,	1
your	1
worship,	1
and	1
let	1
me	1
give	1
myself	1
at	1
any	1
rate	1
a	1
thousand	1
lashes	1
more;	1
for	1
in	1
a	1
couple	1
of	1
bouts	1
like	1
this	1
we	1
shall	1
have	1
finished	1
off	1
the	1
lot,	1
and	1
there	1
will	1
be	1
even	1
cloth	1
to	1
spare.”	1
“As	1
thou	1
art	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
willing	1
mood,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“may	1
heaven	1
aid	1
thee;	1
lay	1
on	1
and	1
I’ll	1
retire.”	1
Sancho	1
returned	1
to	1
his	1
task	1
with	1
so	1
much	1
resolution	1
that	1
he	1
soon	1
had	1
the	1
bark	1
stripped	1
off	1
several	1
trees,	1
such	1
was	1
the	1
severity	1
with	1
which	1
he	1
whipped	1
himself;	1
and	1
one	1
time,	1
raising	1
his	1
voice,	1
and	1
giving	1
a	1
beech	1
a	1
tremendous	1
lash,	1
he	1
cried	1
out,	1
“Here	1
dies	1
Samson,	1
and	1
all	1
with	1
him!”	1

At	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
his	1
piteous	1
cry	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
stroke	1
of	1
the	1
cruel	1
lash,	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
ran	1
to	1
him	1
at	1
once,	1
and	1
seizing	1
the	1
twisted	1
halter	1
that	1
served	1
him	1
for	1
a	1
courbash,	1
said	1
to	1
him,	1
“Heaven	1
forbid,	1
Sancho	1
my	1
friend,	1
that	1
to	1
please	1
me	1
thou	1
shouldst	1
lose	1
thy	1
life,	1
which	1
is	1
needed	1
for	1
the	1
support	1
of	1
thy	1
wife	1
and	1
children;	1
let	1
Dulcinea	1
wait	1
for	1
a	1
better	1
opportunity,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
content	1
myself	1
with	1
a	1
hope	1
soon	1
to	1
be	1
realised,	1
and	1
have	1
patience	1
until	1
thou	1
hast	1
gained	1
fresh	1
strength	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
finish	1
off	1
this	1
business	1
to	1
the	1
satisfaction	1
of	1
everybody.”	1
“As	1
your	1
worship	1
will	1
have	1
it	1
so,	1
señor,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“so	1
be	1
it;	1
but	1
throw	1
your	1
cloak	1
over	1
my	1
shoulders,	1
for	1
I’m	1
sweating	1
and	1
I	1
don’t	1
want	1
to	1
take	1
cold;	1
it’s	1
a	1
risk	1
that	1
novice	1
disciplinants	1
run.”	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
obeyed,	1
and	1
stripping	1
himself	1
covered	1
Sancho,	1
who	1
slept	1
until	1
the	1
sun	1
woke	1
him;	1
they	1
then	1
resumed	1
their	1
journey,	1
which	1
for	1
the	1
time	1
being	1
they	1
brought	1
to	1
an	1
end	1
at	1
a	1
village	1
that	1
lay	1
three	1
leagues	1
farther	1
on.	1
They	1
dismounted	1
at	1
a	1
hostelry	1
which	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
recognised	1
as	1
such	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
take	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
castle	1
with	1
moat,	1
turrets,	1
portcullis,	1
and	1
drawbridge;	1
for	1
ever	1
since	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
vanquished	1
he	1
talked	1
more	1
rationally	1
about	1
everything,	1
as	1
will	1
be	1
shown	1
presently.	1
They	1
quartered	1
him	1
in	1
a	1
room	1
on	1
the	1
ground	1
floor,	1
where	1
in	1
place	1
of	1
leather	1
hangings	1
there	1
were	1
pieces	1
of	1
painted	1
serge	1
such	1
as	1
they	1
commonly	1
use	1
in	1
villages.	1
On	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
was	1
painted	1
by	1
some	1
very	1
poor	1
hand	1
the	1
Rape	1
of	1
Helen,	1
when	1
the	1
bold	1
guest	1
carried	1
her	1
off	1
from	1
Menelaus,	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
was	1
the	1
story	1
of	1
Dido	1
and	1
Æneas,	1
she	1
on	1
a	1
high	1
tower,	1
as	1
though	1
she	1
were	1
making	1
signals	1
with	1
a	1
half	1
sheet	1
to	1
her	1
fugitive	1
guest	1
who	1
was	1
out	1
at	1
sea	1
flying	1
in	1
a	1
frigate	1
or	1
brigantine.	1
He	1
noticed	1
in	1
the	1
two	1
stories	1
that	1
Helen	1
did	1
not	1
go	1
very	1
reluctantly,	1
for	1
she	1
was	1
laughing	1
slyly	1
and	1
roguishly;	1
but	1
the	1
fair	1
Dido	1
was	1
shown	1
dropping	1
tears	1
the	1
size	1
of	1
walnuts	1
from	1
her	1
eyes.	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
as	1
he	1
looked	1
at	1
them	1
observed,	1
“Those	1
two	1
ladies	1
were	1
very	1
unfortunate	1
not	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
born	1
in	1
this	1
age,	1
and	1
I	1
unfortunate	1
above	1
all	1
men	1
not	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
born	1
in	1
theirs.	1
Had	1
I	1
fallen	1
in	1
with	1
those	1
gentlemen,	1
Troy	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
been	1
burned	1
or	1
Carthage	1
destroyed,	1
for	1
it	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
only	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
slay	1
Paris,	1
and	1
all	1
these	1
misfortunes	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
avoided.”	1
“I’ll	1
lay	1
a	1
bet,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“that	1
before	1
long	1
there	1
won’t	1
be	1
a	1
tavern,	1
roadside	1
inn,	1
hostelry,	1
or	1
barber’s	1
shop	1
where	1
the	1
story	1
of	1
our	1
doings	1
won’t	1
be	1
painted	1
up;	1
but	1
I’d	1
like	1
it	1
painted	1
by	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
a	1
better	1
painter	1
than	1
painted	1
these.”	1
“Thou	1
art	1
right,	1
Sancho,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“for	1
this	1
painter	1
is	1
like	1
Orbaneja,	1
a	1
painter	1
there	1
was	1
at	1
Úbeda,	1
who	1
when	1
they	1
asked	1
him	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
painting,	1
used	1
to	1
say,	1
‘Whatever	1
it	1
may	1
turn	1
out;	1
and	1
if	1
he	1
chanced	1
to	1
paint	1
a	1
cock	1
he	1
would	1
write	1
under	1
it,	1
‘This	1
is	1
a	1
cock,’	1
for	1
fear	1
they	1
might	1
think	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
fox.	1
The	1
painter	1
or	1
writer,	1
for	1
it’s	1
all	1
the	1
same,	1
who	1
published	1
the	1
history	1
of	1
this	1
new	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
that	1
has	1
come	1
out,	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
one	1
of	1
this	1
sort	1
I	1
think,	1
Sancho,	1
for	1
he	1
painted	1
or	1
wrote	1
‘whatever	1
it	1
might	1
turn	1
out;’	1
or	1
perhaps	1
he	1
is	1
like	1
a	1
poet	1
called	1
Mauleon	1
that	1
was	1
about	1
the	1
Court	1
some	1
years	1
ago,	1
who	1
used	1
to	1
answer	1
at	1
haphazard	1
whatever	1
he	1
was	1
asked,	1
and	1
on	1
one	1
asking	1
him	1
what	1
_Deum	1
de	1
Deo_	1
meant,	1
he	1
replied	1
_Dé	1
donde	1
diere_.	1
But,	1
putting	1
this	1
aside,	1
tell	1
me,	1
Sancho,	1
hast	1
thou	1
a	1
mind	1
to	1
have	1
another	1
turn	1
at	1
thyself	1
to-night,	1
and	1
wouldst	1
thou	1
rather	1
have	1
it	1
indoors	1
or	1
in	1
the	1
open	1
air?”	1
“Egad,	1
señor,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“for	1
what	1
I’m	1
going	1
to	1
give	1
myself,	1
it	1
comes	1
all	1
the	1
same	1
to	1
me	1
whether	1
it	1
is	1
in	1
a	1
house	1
or	1
in	1
the	1
fields;	1
still	1
I’d	1
like	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
among	1
trees;	1
for	1
I	1
think	1
they	1
are	1
company	1
for	1
me	1
and	1
help	1
me	1
to	1
bear	1
my	1
pain	1
wonderfully.”	1
“And	1
yet	1
it	1
must	1
not	1
be,	1
Sancho	1
my	1
friend,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
“but,	1
to	1
enable	1
thee	1
to	1
recover	1
strength,	1
we	1
must	1
keep	1
it	1
for	1
our	1
own	1
village;	1
for	1
at	1
the	1
latest	1
we	1
shall	1
get	1
there	1
the	1
day	1
after	1
to-morrow.”	1
Sancho	1
said	1
he	1
might	1
do	1
as	1
he	1
pleased;	1
but	1
that	1
for	1
his	1
own	1
part	1
he	1
would	1
like	1
to	1
finish	1
off	1
the	1
business	1
quickly	1
before	1
his	1
blood	1
cooled	1
and	1
while	1
he	1
had	1
an	1
appetite,	1
because	1
“in	1
delay	1
there	1
is	1
apt	1
to	1
be	1
danger”	1
very	1
often,	1
and	1
“praying	1
to	1
God	1
and	1
plying	1
the	1
hammer,”	1
and	1
“one	1
take	1
was	1
better	1
than	1
two	1
I’ll	1
give	1
thee’s,”	1
and	1
“a	1
sparrow	1
in	1
the	1
hand	1
than	1
a	1
vulture	1
on	1
the	1
wing.”	1
“For	1
God’s	1
sake,	1
Sancho,	1
no	1
more	1
proverbs!”	1
exclaimed	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
“it	1
seems	1
to	1
me	1
thou	1
art	1
becoming	1
_sicut	1
erat_	1
again;	1
speak	1
in	1
a	1
plain,	1
simple,	1
straight-forward	1
way,	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
often	1
told	1
thee,	1
and	1
thou	1
wilt	1
find	1
the	1
good	1
of	1
it.”	1
“I	1
don’t	1
know	1
what	1
bad	1
luck	1
it	1
is	1
of	1
mine,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“but	1
I	1
can’t	1
utter	1
a	1
word	1
without	1
a	1
proverb	1
that	1
is	1
not	1
as	1
good	1
as	1
an	1
argument	1
to	1
my	1
mind;	1
however,	1
I	1
mean	1
to	1
mend	1
if	1
I	1
can;”	1
and	1
so	1
for	1
the	1
present	1
the	1
conversation	1
ended.	1

LXXII.	1

HOW	1
DON	1
QUIXOTE	1
AND	1
SANCHO	1
REACHED	1
THEIR	1
VILLAGE	1
p72a.jpg	1

Full	1
Size	1
All	1
that	1
day	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
and	1
Sancho	1
remained	1
in	1
the	1
village	1
and	1
inn	1
waiting	1
for	1
night,	1
the	1
one	1
to	1
finish	1
off	1
his	1
task	1
of	1
scourging	1
in	1
the	1
open	1
country,	1
the	1
other	1
to	1
see	1
it	1
accomplished,	1
for	1
therein	1
lay	1
the	1
accomplishment	1
of	1
his	1
wishes.	1
Meanwhile	1
there	1
arrived	1
at	1
the	1
hostelry	1
a	1
traveller	1
on	1
horseback	1
with	1
three	1
or	1
four	1
servants,	1
one	1
of	1
whom	1
said	1
to	1
him	1
who	1
appeared	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
master,	1
“Here,	1
Señor	1
Don	1
Álvaro	1
Tarfe,	1
your	1
worship	1
may	1
take	1
your	1
siesta	1
to-day;	1
the	1
quarters	1
seem	1
clean	1
and	1
cool.”	1
When	1
he	1
heard	1
this	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
said	1
to	1
Sancho,	1
“Look	1
here,	1
Sancho;	1
on	1
turning	1
over	1
the	1
leaves	1
of	1
that	1
book	1
of	1
the	1
Second	1
Part	1
of	1
my	1
history	1
I	1
think	1
I	1
came	1
casually	1
upon	1
this	1
name	1
of	1
Don	1
Álvaro	1
Tarfe.”	1
“Very	1
likely,”	1
said	1
Sancho;	1
“we	1
had	1
better	1
let	1
him	1
dismount,	1
and	1
by-and-by	1
we	1
can	1
ask	1
about	1
it.”	1
The	1
gentleman	1
dismounted,	1
and	1
the	1
landlady	1
gave	1
him	1
a	1
room	1
on	1
the	1
ground	1
floor	1
opposite	1
Don	1
Quixote’s	1
and	1
adorned	1
with	1
painted	1
serge	1
hangings	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
sort.	1
The	1
newly	1
arrived	1
gentleman	1
put	1
on	1
a	1
summer	1
coat,	1
and	1
coming	1
out	1
to	1
the	1
gateway	1
of	1
the	1
hostelry,	1
which	1
was	1
wide	1
and	1
cool,	1
addressing	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
who	1
was	1
pacing	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
there,	1
he	1
asked,	1
“In	1
what	1
direction	1
is	1
your	1
worship	1
bound,	1
gentle	1
sir?”	1
“To	1
a	1
village	1
near	1
this	1
which	1
is	1
my	1
own	1
village,”	1
replied	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
“and	1
your	1
worship,	1
where	1
are	1
you	1
bound	1
for?”	1
“I	1
am	1
going	1
to	1
Granada,	1
señor,”	1
said	1
the	1
gentleman,	1
“to	1
my	1
own	1
country.”	1
“And	1
a	1
goodly	1
country,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
“but	1
will	1
your	1
worship	1
do	1
me	1
the	1
favour	1
of	1
telling	1
me	1
your	1
name,	1
for	1
it	1
strikes	1
me	1
it	1
is	1
of	1
more	1
importance	1
to	1
me	1
to	1
know	1
it	1
than	1
I	1
can	1
tell	1
you.”	1
“My	1
name	1
is	1
Don	1
Álvaro	1
Tarfe,”	1
replied	1
the	1
traveller.	1
To	1
which	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
returned,	1
“I	1
have	1
no	1
doubt	1
whatever	1
that	1
your	1
worship	1
is	1
that	1
Don	1
Álvaro	1
Tarfe	1
who	1
appears	1
in	1
print	1
in	1
the	1
Second	1
Part	1
of	1
the	1
history	1
of	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
of	1
La	1
Mancha,	1
lately	1
printed	1
and	1
published	1
by	1
a	1
new	1
author.”	1
“I	1
am	1
the	1
same,”	1
replied	1
the	1
gentleman;	1
“and	1
that	1
same	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
the	1
principal	1
personage	1
in	1
the	1
said	1
history,	1
was	1
a	1
very	1
great	1
friend	1
of	1
mine,	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
I	1
who	1
took	1
him	1
away	1
from	1
home,	1
or	1
at	1
least	1
induced	1
him	1
to	1
come	1
to	1
some	1
jousts	1
that	1
were	1
to	1
be	1
held	1
at	1
Saragossa,	1
whither	1
I	1
was	1
going	1
myself;	1
indeed,	1
I	1
showed	1
him	1
many	1
kindnesses,	1
and	1
saved	1
him	1
from	1
having	1
his	1
shoulders	1
touched	1
up	1
by	1
the	1
executioner	1
because	1
of	1
his	1
extreme	1
rashness.”	1
“Tell	1
me,	1
Señor	1
Don	1
Álvaro,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“am	1
I	1
at	1
all	1
like	1
that	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
you	1
talk	1
of?”	1
“No	1
indeed,”	1
replied	1
the	1
traveller,	1
“not	1
a	1
bit.”	1
“And	1
that	1
Don	1
Quixote—”	1
said	1
our	1
one,	1
“had	1
he	1
with	1
him	1
a	1
squire	1
called	1
Sancho	1
Panza?”	1
“He	1
had,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Álvaro;	1
“but	1
though	1
he	1
had	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
being	1
very	1
droll,	1
I	1
never	1
heard	1
him	1
say	1
anything	1
that	1
had	1
any	1
drollery	1
in	1
it.”	1
“That	1
I	1
can	1
well	1
believe,”	1
said	1
Sancho	1
at	1
this,	1
“for	1
to	1
come	1
out	1
with	1
drolleries	1
is	1
not	1
in	1
everybody’s	1
line;	1
and	1
that	1
Sancho	1
your	1
worship	1
speaks	1
of,	1
gentle	1
sir,	1
must	1
be	1
some	1
great	1
scoundrel,	1
dunderhead,	1
and	1
thief,	1
all	1
in	1
one;	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
real	1
Sancho	1
Panza,	1
and	1
I	1
have	1
more	1
drolleries	1
than	1
if	1
it	1
rained	1
them;	1
let	1
your	1
worship	1
only	1
try;	1
come	1
along	1
with	1
me	1
for	1
a	1
year	1
or	1
so,	1
and	1
you	1
will	1
find	1
they	1
fall	1
from	1
me	1
at	1
every	1
turn,	1
and	1
so	1
rich	1
and	1
so	1
plentiful	1
that	1
though	1
mostly	1
I	1
don’t	1
know	1
what	1
I	1
am	1
saying	1
I	1
make	1
everybody	1
that	1
hears	1
me	1
laugh.	1
And	1
the	1
real	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
of	1
La	1
Mancha,	1
the	1
famous,	1
the	1
valiant,	1
the	1
wise,	1
the	1
lover,	1
the	1
righter	1
of	1
wrongs,	1
the	1
guardian	1
of	1
minors	1
and	1
orphans,	1
the	1
protector	1
of	1
widows,	1
the	1
killer	1
of	1
damsels,	1
he	1
who	1
has	1
for	1
his	1
sole	1
mistress	1
the	1
peerless	1
Dulcinea	1
del	1
Toboso,	1
is	1
this	1
gentleman	1
before	1
you,	1
my	1
master;	1
all	1
other	1
Don	1
Quixotes	1
and	1
all	1
other	1
Sancho	1
Panzas	1
are	1
dreams	1
and	1
mockeries.”	1
“By	1
God	1
I	1
believe	1
it,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Álvaro;	1
“for	1
you	1
have	1
uttered	1
more	1
drolleries,	1
my	1
friend,	1
in	1
the	1
few	1
words	1
you	1
have	1
spoken	1
than	1
the	1
other	1
Sancho	1
Panza	1
in	1
all	1
I	1
ever	1
heard	1
from	1
him,	1
and	1
they	1
were	1
not	1
a	1
few.	1
He	1
was	1
more	1
greedy	1
than	1
well-spoken,	1
and	1
more	1
dull	1
than	1
droll;	1
and	1
I	1
am	1
convinced	1
that	1
the	1
enchanters	1
who	1
persecute	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
the	1
Good	1
have	1
been	1
trying	1
to	1
persecute	1
me	1
with	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
the	1
Bad.	1
But	1
I	1
don’t	1
know	1
what	1
to	1
say,	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
ready	1
to	1
swear	1
I	1
left	1
him	1
shut	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
Casa	1
del	1
Nuncio	1
at	1
Toledo,	1
and	1
here	1
another	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
turns	1
up,	1
though	1
a	1
very	1
different	1
one	1
from	1
mine.”	1
“I	1
don’t	1
know	1
whether	1
I	1
am	1
good,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“but	1
I	1
can	1
safely	1
say	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
‘the	1
Bad;’	1
and	1
to	1
prove	1
it,	1
let	1
me	1
tell	1
you,	1
Señor	1
Don	1
Álvaro	1
Tarfe,	1
I	1
have	1
never	1
in	1
my	1
life	1
been	1
in	1
Saragossa;	1
so	1
far	1
from	1
that,	1
when	1
it	1
was	1
told	1
me	1
that	1
this	1
imaginary	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
had	1
been	1
present	1
at	1
the	1
jousts	1
in	1
that	1
city,	1
I	1
declined	1
to	1
enter	1
it,	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
drag	1
his	1
falsehood	1
before	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
world;	1
and	1
so	1
I	1
went	1
on	1
straight	1
to	1
Barcelona,	1
the	1
treasure-house	1
of	1
courtesy,	1
haven	1
of	1
strangers,	1
asylum	1
of	1
the	1
poor,	1

of	1
the	1
valiant,	1
champion	1
of	1
the	1
wronged,	1
pleasant	1
exchange	1
of	1

and	1
city	1

And	1
though	1
the	1
adventures	1
that	1
befell	1
me	1
there	1
are	1
not	1
by	1
any	1
means	1
matters	1
of	1
enjoyment,	1
but	1
rather	1
of	1
regret,	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
regret	1
them,	1
simply	1
because	1
I	1
have	1
seen	1
it.	1
In	1
a	1
word,	1
Señor	1
Don	1
Álvaro	1
Tarfe,	1
I	1
am	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
of	1
La	1
Mancha,	1
the	1
one	1
that	1
fame	1
speaks	1
of,	1
and	1
not	1
the	1
unlucky	1
one	1
that	1
has	1
attempted	1
to	1
usurp	1
my	1
name	1
and	1
deck	1
himself	1
out	1
in	1
my	1
ideas.	1
I	1
entreat	1
your	1
worship	1
by	1
your	1
devoir	1
as	1
a	1
gentleman	1
to	1
be	1
so	1
good	1
as	1
to	1
make	1
a	1
declaration	1
before	1
the	1
alcalde	1
of	1
this	1
village	1
that	1
you	1
never	1
in	1
all	1
your	1
life	1
saw	1
me	1
until	1
now,	1
and	1
that	1
neither	1
am	1
I	1
the	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
in	1
print	1
in	1
the	1
Second	1
Part,	1
nor	1
this	1
Sancho	1
Panza,	1
my	1
squire,	1
the	1
one	1
your	1
worship	1
knew.”	1
“That	1
I	1
will	1
do	1
most	1
willingly,”	1
replied	1
Don	1
Álvaro;	1
“though	1
it	1
amazes	1
me	1
to	1
find	1
two	1
Don	1
Quixotes	1
and	1
two	1
Sancho	1
Panzas	1
at	1
once,	1
as	1
much	1
alike	1
in	1
name	1
as	1
they	1
differ	1
in	1
demeanour;	1
and	1
again	1
I	1
say	1
and	1
declare	1
that	1
what	1
I	1
saw	1
I	1
cannot	1
have	1
seen,	1
and	1
that	1
what	1
happened	1
me	1
cannot	1
have	1
happened.”	1
“No	1
doubt	1
your	1
worship	1
is	1
enchanted,	1
like	1
my	1
lady	1
Dulcinea	1
del	1
Toboso,”	1
said	1
Sancho;	1
“and	1
would	1
to	1
heaven	1
your	1
disenchantment	1
rested	1
on	1
my	1
giving	1
myself	1
another	1
three	1
thousand	1
and	1
odd	1
lashes	1
like	1
what	1
I’m	1
giving	1
myself	1
for	1
her,	1
for	1
I’d	1
lay	1
them	1
on	1
without	1
looking	1
for	1
anything.”	1
“I	1
don’t	1
understand	1
that	1
about	1
the	1
lashes,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Álvaro.	1
Sancho	1
replied	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
long	1
story	1
to	1
tell,	1
but	1
he	1
would	1
tell	1
him	1
if	1
they	1
happened	1
to	1
be	1
going	1
the	1
same	1
road.	1
By	1
this	1
dinner-time	1
arrived,	1
and	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
and	1
Don	1
Álvaro	1
dined	1
together.	1
The	1
alcalde	1
of	1
the	1
village	1
came	1
by	1
chance	1
into	1
the	1
inn	1
together	1
with	1
a	1
notary,	1
and	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
laid	1
a	1
petition	1
before	1
him,	1
showing	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
requisite	1
for	1
his	1
rights	1
that	1
Don	1
Álvaro	1
Tarfe,	1
the	1
gentleman	1
there	1
present,	1
should	1
make	1
a	1
declaration	1
before	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
of	1
La	1
Mancha,	1
also	1
there	1
present,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
the	1
one	1
that	1
was	1
in	1
print	1
in	1
a	1
history	1
entitled	1
“Second	1
Part	1
of	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
of	1
La	1
Mancha,	1
by	1
one	1
Avellaneda	1
of	1
Tordesillas.”	1
The	1
alcalde	1
finally	1
put	1
it	1
in	1
legal	1
form,	1
and	1
the	1
declaration	1
was	1
made	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
formalities	1
required	1
in	1
such	1
cases,	1
at	1
which	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
and	1
Sancho	1
were	1
in	1
high	1
delight,	1
as	1
if	1
a	1
declaration	1
of	1
the	1
sort	1
was	1
of	1
any	1
great	1
importance	1
to	1
them,	1
and	1
as	1
if	1
their	1
words	1
and	1
deeds	1
did	1
not	1
plainly	1
show	1
the	1
difference	1
between	1
the	1
two	1
Don	1
Quixotes	1
and	1
the	1
two	1
Sanchos.	1
Many	1
civilities	1
and	1
offers	1
of	1
service	1
were	1
exchanged	1
by	1
Don	1
Álvaro	1
and	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
in	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
which	1
the	1
great	1
Manchegan	1
displayed	1
such	1
good	1
taste	1
that	1
he	1
disabused	1
Don	1
Álvaro	1
of	1
the	1
error	1
he	1
was	1
under;	1
and	1
he,	1
on	1
his	1
part,	1
felt	1
convinced	1
he	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
enchanted,	1
now	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
brought	1
in	1
contact	1
with	1
two	1
such	1
opposite	1
Don	1
Quixotes.	1
Evening	1
came,	1
they	1
set	1
out	1
from	1
the	1
village,	1
and	1
after	1
about	1
half	1
a	1
league	1
two	1
roads	1
branched	1
off,	1
one	1
leading	1
to	1
Don	1
Quixote’s	1
village,	1
the	1
other	1
the	1
road	1
Don	1
Álvaro	1
was	1
to	1
follow.	1
In	1
this	1
short	1
interval	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
told	1
him	1
of	1
his	1
unfortunate	1
defeat,	1
and	1
of	1
Dulcinea’s	1
enchantment	1
and	1
the	1
remedy,	1
all	1
which	1
threw	1
Don	1
Álvaro	1
into	1
fresh	1
amazement,	1
and	1
embracing	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
and	1
Sancho,	1
he	1
went	1
his	1
way,	1
and	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
went	1
his.	1
That	1
night	1
he	1
passed	1
among	1
trees	1
again	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
give	1
Sancho	1
an	1
opportunity	1
of	1
working	1
out	1
his	1
penance,	1
which	1
he	1
did	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
fashion	1
as	1
the	1
night	1
before,	1
at	1
the	1
expense	1
of	1
the	1
bark	1
of	1
the	1
beech	1
trees	1
much	1
more	1
than	1
of	1
his	1
back,	1
of	1
which	1
he	1
took	1
such	1
good	1
care	1
that	1
the	1
lashes	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
knocked	1
off	1
a	1
fly	1
had	1
there	1
been	1
one	1
there.	1
The	1
duped	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
did	1
not	1
miss	1
a	1
single	1
stroke	1
of	1
the	1
count,	1
and	1
he	1
found	1
that	1
together	1
with	1
those	1
of	1
the	1
night	1
before	1
they	1
made	1
up	1
three	1
thousand	1
and	1
twenty-nine.	1
The	1
sun	1
apparently	1
had	1
got	1
up	1
early	1
to	1
witness	1
the	1
sacrifice,	1
and	1
with	1
his	1
light	1
they	1
resumed	1
their	1
journey,	1
discussing	1
the	1
deception	1
practised	1
on	1
Don	1
Álvaro,	1
and	1
saying	1
how	1
well	1
done	1
it	1
was	1
to	1
have	1
taken	1
his	1
declaration	1
before	1
a	1
magistrate	1
in	1
such	1
an	1
unimpeachable	1
form.	1
That	1
day	1
and	1
night	1
they	1
travelled	1
on,	1
nor	1
did	1
anything	1
worth	1
mention	1
happen	1
to	1
them,	1
unless	1
it	1
was	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
the	1
night	1
Sancho	1
finished	1
off	1
his	1
task,	1
whereat	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
was	1
beyond	1
measure	1
joyful.	1
He	1
watched	1
for	1
daylight,	1
to	1
see	1
if	1
along	1
the	1
road	1
he	1
should	1
fall	1
in	1
with	1
his	1
already	1
disenchanted	1
lady	1
Dulcinea;	1
and	1
as	1
he	1
pursued	1
his	1
journey	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
woman	1
he	1
met	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
go	1
up	1
to,	1
to	1
see	1
if	1
she	1
was	1
Dulcinea	1
del	1
Toboso,	1
as	1
he	1
held	1
it	1
absolutely	1
certain	1
that	1
Merlin’s	1
promises	1
could	1
not	1
lie.	1
Full	1
of	1
these	1
thoughts	1
and	1
anxieties,	1
they	1
ascended	1
a	1
rising	1
ground	1
wherefrom	1
they	1
descried	1
their	1
own	1
village,	1
at	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
which	1
Sancho	1
fell	1
on	1
his	1
knees	1
exclaiming,	1
“Open	1
thine	1
eyes,	1
longed-for	1
home,	1
and	1
see	1
how	1
thy	1
son	1
Sancho	1
Panza	1
comes	1
back	1
to	1
thee,	1
if	1
not	1
very	1
rich,	1
very	1
well	1
whipped!	1
Open	1
thine	1
arms	1
and	1
receive,	1
too,	1
thy	1
son	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
who,	1
if	1
he	1
comes	1
vanquished	1
by	1
the	1
arm	1
of	1
another,	1
comes	1
victor	1
over	1
himself,	1
which,	1
as	1
he	1
himself	1
has	1
told	1
me,	1
is	1
the	1
greatest	1
victory	1
anyone	1
can	1
desire.	1
I’m	1
bringing	1
back	1
money,	1
for	1
if	1
I	1
was	1
well	1
whipped,	1
I	1
went	1
mounted	1
like	1
a	1
gentleman.”	1

“Have	1
done	1
with	1
these	1
fooleries,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
“let	1
us	1
push	1
on	1
straight	1
and	1
get	1
to	1
our	1
own	1
place,	1

to	1
our	1
fancies,	1
and	1
settle	1
our	1
plans	1
for	1
our	1
future	1

life.”	1
With	1
this	1
they	1
descended	1
the	1
slope	1
and	1
directed	1
their	1
steps	1
to	1
their	1
village.	1

At	1
the	1
entrance	1
of	1
the	1
village,	1
so	1
says	1
Cide	1
Hamete,	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
saw	1
two	1
boys	1
quarrelling	1
on	1
the	1
village	1
threshing-floor,	1
one	1
of	1
whom	1
said	1
to	1
the	1
other,	1
“Take	1
it	1
easy,	1
Periquillo;	1
thou	1
shalt	1
never	1
see	1
it	1
again	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
thou	1
livest.”	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
heard	1
this,	1
and	1
said	1
he	1
to	1
Sancho,	1
“Dost	1
thou	1
not	1
mark,	1
friend,	1
what	1
that	1
boy	1
said,	1
‘Thou	1
shalt	1
never	1
see	1
it	1
again	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
thou	1
livest’?”	1
“Well,”	1
said	1
Sancho,	1
“what	1
does	1
it	1
matter	1
if	1
the	1
boy	1
said	1
so?”	1
“What!”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“dost	1
thou	1
not	1
see	1
that,	1
applied	1
to	1
the	1
object	1
of	1
my	1
desires,	1
the	1
words	1
mean	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
never	1
to	1
see	1
Dulcinea	1
more?”	1
Sancho	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
answer,	1
when	1
his	1
attention	1
was	1
diverted	1
by	1
seeing	1
a	1
hare	1
come	1
flying	1
across	1
the	1
plain	1
pursued	1
by	1
several	1
greyhounds	1
and	1
sportsmen.	1
In	1
its	1
terror	1
it	1
ran	1
to	1
take	1
shelter	1
and	1
hide	1
itself	1
under	1
Dapple.	1
Sancho	1
caught	1
it	1
alive	1
and	1
presented	1
it	1
to	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
who	1
was	1
saying,	1
“_Malum	1
signum,	1
malum	1
signum!_	1
a	1
hare	1
flies,	1
greyhounds	1
chase	1
it,	1
Dulcinea	1
appears	1
not.”	1
“Your	1
worship’s	1
a	1
strange	1
man,”	1
said	1
Sancho;	1
“let’s	1
take	1
it	1
for	1
granted	1
that	1
this	1
hare	1
is	1
Dulcinea,	1
and	1
these	1
greyhounds	1
chasing	1
it	1
the	1
malignant	1
enchanters	1
who	1
turned	1
her	1
into	1
a	1
country	1
wench;	1
she	1
flies,	1
and	1
I	1
catch	1
her	1
and	1
put	1
her	1
into	1
your	1
worship’s	1
hands,	1
and	1
you	1
hold	1
her	1
in	1
your	1
arms	1
and	1
cherish	1
her;	1
what	1
bad	1
sign	1
is	1
that,	1
or	1
what	1
ill	1
omen	1
is	1
there	1
to	1
be	1
found	1
here?”	1
The	1
two	1
boys	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
quarrelling	1
came	1
over	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
the	1
hare,	1
and	1
Sancho	1
asked	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
what	1
their	1
quarrel	1
was	1
about.	1
He	1
was	1
answered	1
by	1
the	1
one	1
who	1
had	1
said,	1
“Thou	1
shalt	1
never	1
see	1
it	1
again	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
thou	1
livest,”	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
taken	1
a	1
cage	1
full	1
of	1
crickets	1
from	1
the	1
other	1
boy,	1
and	1
did	1
not	1
mean	1
to	1
give	1
it	1
back	1
to	1
him	1
as	1
long	1
as	1
he	1
lived.	1
Sancho	1
took	1
out	1
four	1
cuartos	1
from	1
his	1
pocket	1
and	1
gave	1
them	1
to	1
the	1
boy	1
for	1
the	1
cage,	1
which	1
he	1
placed	1
in	1
Don	1
Quixote’s	1
hands,	1
saying,	1
“There,	1
señor!	1
there	1
are	1
the	1
omens	1
broken	1
and	1
destroyed,	1
and	1
they	1
have	1
no	1
more	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
our	1
affairs,	1
to	1
my	1
thinking,	1
fool	1
as	1
I	1
am,	1
than	1
with	1
last	1
year’s	1
clouds;	1
and	1
if	1
I	1
remember	1
rightly	1
I	1
have	1
heard	1
the	1
curate	1
of	1
our	1
village	1
say	1
that	1
it	1
does	1
not	1
become	1
Christians	1
or	1
sensible	1
people	1
to	1
give	1
any	1
heed	1
to	1
these	1
silly	1
things;	1
and	1
even	1
you	1
yourself	1
said	1
the	1
same	1
to	1
me	1
some	1
time	1
ago,	1
telling	1
me	1
that	1
all	1
Christians	1
who	1
minded	1
omens	1
were	1
fools;	1
but	1
there’s	1
no	1
need	1
of	1
making	1
words	1
about	1
it;	1
let	1
us	1
push	1
on	1
and	1
go	1
into	1
our	1
village.”	1
The	1
sportsmen	1
came	1
up	1
and	1
asked	1
for	1
their	1
hare,	1
which	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
gave	1
them.	1
They	1
then	1
went	1
on,	1
and	1
upon	1
the	1
green	1
at	1
the	1
entrance	1
of	1
the	1
town	1
they	1
came	1
upon	1
the	1
curate	1
and	1
the	1
bachelor	1
Samson	1
Carrasco	1
busy	1
with	1
their	1
breviaries.	1
It	1
should	1
be	1
mentioned	1
that	1
Sancho	1
had	1
thrown,	1
by	1
way	1
of	1
a	1
sumpter-cloth,	1
over	1
Dapple	1
and	1
over	1
the	1
bundle	1
of	1
armour,	1
the	1
buckram	1
robe	1
painted	1
with	1
flames	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
put	1
upon	1
him	1
at	1
the	1
duke’s	1
castle	1
the	1
night	1
Altisidora	1
came	1
back	1
to	1
life.	1
He	1
had	1
also	1
fixed	1
the	1
mitre	1
on	1
Dapple’s	1
head,	1
the	1
oddest	1
transformation	1
and	1
decoration	1
that	1
ever	1
ass	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
underwent.	1
They	1
were	1
at	1
once	1
recognised	1
by	1
both	1
the	1
curate	1
and	1
the	1
bachelor,	1
who	1
came	1
towards	1
them	1
with	1
open	1
arms.	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
dismounted	1
and	1
received	1
them	1
with	1
a	1
close	1
embrace;	1
and	1
the	1
boys,	1
who	1
are	1
lynxes	1
that	1
nothing	1
escapes,	1
spied	1
out	1
the	1
ass’s	1
mitre	1
and	1
came	1
running	1
to	1
see	1
it,	1
calling	1
out	1
to	1
one	1
another,	1
“Come	1
here,	1
boys,	1
and	1
see	1
Sancho	1
Panza’s	1
ass	1
figged	1
out	1
finer	1
than	1
Mingo,	1
and	1
Don	1
Quixote’s	1
beast	1
leaner	1
than	1
ever.”	1
So	1
at	1
length,	1
with	1
the	1
boys	1
capering	1
round	1
them,	1
and	1
accompanied	1
by	1
the	1
curate	1
and	1
the	1
bachelor,	1
they	1
made	1
their	1
entrance	1
into	1
the	1
town,	1
and	1
proceeded	1
to	1
Don	1
Quixote’s	1
house,	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
which	1
they	1
found	1
his	1
housekeeper	1
and	1
niece,	1
whom	1
the	1
news	1
of	1
his	1
arrival	1
had	1
already	1
reached.	1
It	1
had	1
been	1
brought	1
to	1
Teresa	1
Panza,	1
Sancho’s	1
wife,	1
as	1
well,	1
and	1
she	1
with	1
her	1
hair	1
all	1
loose	1
and	1
half	1
naked,	1
dragging	1
Sanchica	1
her	1
daughter	1
by	1
the	1
hand,	1
ran	1
out	1
to	1
meet	1
her	1
husband;	1
but	1
seeing	1
him	1
coming	1
in	1
by	1
no	1
means	1
as	1
good	1
case	1
as	1
she	1
thought	1
a	1
governor	1
ought	1
to	1
be,	1
she	1
said	1
to	1
him,	1
“How	1
is	1
it	1
you	1
come	1
this	1
way,	1
husband?	1
It	1
seems	1
to	1
me	1
you	1
come	1
tramping	1
and	1
footsore,	1
and	1
looking	1
more	1
like	1
a	1
disorderly	1
vagabond	1
than	1
a	1
governor.”	1
“Hold	1
your	1
tongue,	1
Teresa,”	1
said	1
Sancho;	1
“often	1
‘where	1
there	1
are	1
pegs	1
there	1
are	1
no	1
flitches;’	1
let’s	1
go	1
into	1
the	1
house	1
and	1
there	1
you’ll	1
hear	1
strange	1
things.	1
I	1
bring	1
money,	1
and	1
that’s	1
the	1
main	1
thing,	1
got	1
by	1
my	1
own	1
industry	1
without	1
wronging	1
anybody.”	1
“You	1
bring	1
the	1
money,	1
my	1
good	1
husband,”	1
said	1
Teresa,	1
“and	1
no	1
matter	1
whether	1
it	1
was	1
got	1
this	1
way	1
or	1
that;	1
for,	1
however	1
you	1
may	1
have	1
got	1
it,	1
you’ll	1
not	1
have	1
brought	1
any	1
new	1
practice	1
into	1
the	1
world.”	1
Sanchica	1
embraced	1
her	1
father	1
and	1
asked	1
him	1
if	1
he	1
brought	1
her	1
anything,	1
for	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
looking	1
out	1
for	1
him	1
as	1
for	1
the	1
showers	1
of	1
May;	1
and	1
she	1
taking	1
hold	1
of	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
girdle	1
on	1
one	1
side,	1
and	1
his	1
wife	1
by	1
the	1
hand,	1
while	1
the	1
daughter	1
led	1
Dapple,	1
they	1
made	1
for	1
their	1
house,	1
leaving	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
in	1
his,	1
in	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
his	1
niece	1
and	1
housekeeper,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
company	1
of	1
the	1
curate	1
and	1
the	1
bachelor.	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
at	1
once,	1
without	1
any	1
regard	1
to	1
time	1
or	1
season,	1
withdrew	1
in	1
private	1
with	1
the	1
bachelor	1
and	1
the	1
curate,	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
few	1
words	1
told	1
them	1
of	1
his	1
defeat,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
engagement	1
he	1
was	1
under	1
not	1
to	1
quit	1
his	1
village	1
for	1
a	1
year,	1
which	1
he	1
meant	1
to	1
keep	1
to	1
the	1
letter	1
without	1
departing	1
a	1
hair’s	1
breadth	1
from	1
it,	1
as	1
became	1
a	1
knight-errant	1
bound	1
by	1
scrupulous	1
good	1
faith	1
and	1
the	1
laws	1
of	1
knight-errantry;	1
and	1
of	1
how	1
he	1
thought	1
of	1
turning	1
shepherd	1
for	1
that	1
year,	1
and	1
taking	1
his	1
diversion	1
in	1
the	1
solitude	1
of	1
the	1
fields,	1
where	1
he	1
could	1
with	1
perfect	1
freedom	1
give	1
range	1
to	1
his	1
thoughts	1
of	1
love	1
while	1
he	1
followed	1
the	1
virtuous	1
pastoral	1
calling;	1
and	1
he	1
besought	1
them,	1
if	1
they	1
had	1
not	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
to	1
do	1
and	1
were	1
not	1
prevented	1
by	1
more	1
important	1
business,	1
to	1
consent	1
to	1
be	1
his	1
companions,	1
for	1
he	1
would	1
buy	1
sheep	1
enough	1
to	1
qualify	1
them	1
for	1
shepherds;	1
and	1
the	1
most	1
important	1
point	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
affair,	1
he	1
could	1
tell	1
them,	1
was	1
settled,	1
for	1
he	1
had	1
given	1
them	1
names	1
that	1
would	1
fit	1
them	1
to	1
a	1
T.	1
The	1
curate	1
asked	1
what	1
they	1
were.	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
replied	1
that	1
he	1
himself	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
called	1
the	1
shepherd	1
Quixotize	1
and	1
the	1
bachelor	1
the	1
shepherd	1
Carrascon,	1
and	1
the	1
curate	1
the	1
shepherd	1
Curambro,	1
and	1
Sancho	1
Panza	1
the	1
shepherd	1
Pancino.	1
Both	1
were	1
astounded	1
at	1
Don	1
Quixote’s	1
new	1
craze;	1
however,	1
lest	1
he	1
should	1
once	1
more	1
make	1
off	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
village	1
from	1
them	1
in	1
pursuit	1
of	1
his	1
chivalry,	1
they	1
trusting	1
that	1
in	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
the	1
year	1
he	1
might	1
be	1
cured,	1
fell	1
in	1
with	1
his	1
new	1
project,	1
applauded	1
his	1
crazy	1
idea	1
as	1
a	1
bright	1
one,	1
and	1
offered	1
to	1
share	1
the	1
life	1
with	1
him.	1
“And	1
what’s	1
more,”	1
said	1
Samson	1
Carrasco,	1
“I	1
am,	1
as	1
all	1
the	1
world	1
knows,	1
a	1
very	1
famous	1
poet,	1
and	1
I’ll	1
be	1
always	1
making	1
verses,	1
pastoral,	1
or	1
courtly,	1
or	1
as	1
it	1
may	1
come	1
into	1
my	1
head,	1
to	1
pass	1
away	1
our	1
time	1
in	1
those	1
secluded	1
regions	1
where	1
we	1
shall	1
be	1
roaming.	1
But	1
what	1
is	1
most	1
needful,	1
sirs,	1
is	1
that	1
each	1
of	1
us	1
should	1
choose	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
shepherdess	1
he	1
means	1
to	1
glorify	1
in	1
his	1
verses,	1
and	1
that	1
we	1
should	1
not	1
leave	1
a	1
tree,	1
be	1
it	1
ever	1
so	1
hard,	1
without	1
writing	1
up	1
and	1
carving	1
her	1
name	1
on	1
it,	1
as	1
is	1
the	1
habit	1
and	1
custom	1
of	1
love-smitten	1
shepherds.”	1
“That’s	1
the	1
very	1
thing,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
“though	1
I	1
am	1
relieved	1
from	1
looking	1
for	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
an	1
imaginary	1
shepherdess,	1
for	1
there’s	1
the	1
peerless	1
Dulcinea	1
del	1
Toboso,	1
the	1
glory	1
of	1
these	1
brooksides,	1
the	1
ornament	1
of	1
these	1
meadows,	1
the	1
mainstay	1
of	1
beauty,	1
the	1
cream	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
graces,	1
and,	1
in	1
a	1
word,	1
the	1
being	1
to	1
whom	1
all	1
praise	1
is	1
appropriate,	1
be	1
it	1
ever	1
so	1
hyperbolical.”	1
“Very	1
true,”	1
said	1
the	1
curate;	1
“but	1
we	1
the	1
others	1
must	1
look	1
about	1
for	1
accommodating	1
shepherdesses	1
that	1
will	1
answer	1
our	1
purpose	1
one	1
way	1
or	1
another.”	1
“And,”	1
added	1
Samson	1
Carrasco,	1
“if	1
they	1
fail	1
us,	1
we	1
can	1
call	1
them	1
by	1
the	1
names	1
of	1
the	1
ones	1
in	1
print	1
that	1
the	1
world	1
is	1
filled	1
with,	1
Fílidas,	1
Amarilises,	1
Dianas,	1
Fleridas,	1
Galateas,	1
Belisardas;	1
for	1
as	1
they	1
sell	1
them	1
in	1
the	1
market-places	1
we	1
may	1
fairly	1
buy	1
them	1
and	1
make	1
them	1
our	1
own.	1
If	1
my	1
lady,	1
or	1
I	1
should	1
say	1
my	1
shepherdess,	1
happens	1
to	1
be	1
called	1
Ana,	1
I’ll	1
sing	1
her	1
praises	1
under	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Anarda,	1
and	1
if	1
Francisca,	1
I’ll	1
call	1
her	1
Francenia,	1
and	1
if	1
Lucia,	1
Lucinda,	1
for	1
it	1
all	1
comes	1
to	1
the	1
same	1
thing;	1
and	1
Sancho	1
Panza,	1
if	1
he	1
joins	1
this	1
fraternity,	1
may	1
glorify	1
his	1
wife	1
Teresa	1
Panza	1
as	1
Teresaina.”	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
laughed	1
at	1
the	1
adaptation	1
of	1
the	1
name,	1
and	1
the	1
curate	1
bestowed	1
vast	1
praise	1
upon	1
the	1
worthy	1
and	1
honourable	1
resolution	1
he	1
had	1
made,	1
and	1
again	1
offered	1
to	1
bear	1
him	1
company	1
all	1
the	1
time	1
that	1
he	1
could	1
spare	1
from	1
his	1
imperative	1
duties.	1
And	1
so	1
they	1
took	1
their	1
leave	1
of	1
him,	1
recommending	1
and	1
beseeching	1
him	1
to	1
take	1
care	1
of	1
his	1
health	1
and	1
treat	1
himself	1
to	1
a	1
suitable	1
diet.	1
It	1
so	1
happened	1
his	1
niece	1
and	1
the	1
housekeeper	1
overheard	1
all	1
the	1
three	1
of	1
them	1
said;	1
and	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
gone	1
they	1
both	1
of	1
them	1
came	1
in	1
to	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
and	1
said	1
the	1
niece,	1
“What’s	1
this,	1
uncle?	1
Now	1
that	1
we	1
were	1
thinking	1
you	1
had	1
come	1
back	1
to	1
stay	1
at	1
home	1
and	1
lead	1
a	1
quiet	1
respectable	1
life	1
there,	1
are	1
you	1
going	1
to	1
get	1
into	1
fresh	1
entanglements,	1
and	1
turn	1
‘young	1
shepherd,	1
thou	1
that	1
comest	1
here,	1
young	1
shepherd	1
going	1
there?’	1
Nay!	1
indeed	1
‘the	1
straw	1
is	1
too	1
hard	1
now	1
to	1
make	1
pipes	1
of.’”	1
“And,”	1
added	1
the	1
housekeeper,	1
“will	1
your	1
worship	1
be	1
able	1
to	1
bear,	1
out	1
in	1
the	1
fields,	1
the	1
heats	1
of	1
summer,	1
and	1
the	1
chills	1
of	1
winter,	1
and	1
the	1
howling	1
of	1
the	1
wolves?	1
Not	1
you;	1
for	1
that’s	1
a	1
life	1
and	1
a	1
business	1
for	1
hardy	1
men,	1
bred	1
and	1
seasoned	1
to	1
such	1
work	1
almost	1
from	1
the	1
time	1
they	1
were	1
in	1
swaddling-clothes.	1
Why,	1
to	1
make	1
choice	1
of	1
evils,	1
it’s	1
better	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
knight-errant	1
than	1
a	1
shepherd!	1
Look	1
here,	1
señor;	1
take	1
my	1
advice—and	1
I’m	1
not	1
giving	1
it	1
to	1
you	1
full	1
of	1
bread	1
and	1
wine,	1
but	1
fasting,	1
and	1
with	1
fifty	1
years	1
upon	1
my	1
head—stay	1
at	1
home,	1
look	1
after	1
your	1
affairs,	1
go	1
often	1
to	1
confession,	1
be	1
good	1
to	1
the	1
poor,	1
and	1
upon	1
my	1
soul	1
be	1
it	1
if	1
any	1
evil	1
comes	1
to	1
you.”	1
“Hold	1
your	1
peace,	1
my	1
daughters,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
“I	1
know	1
very	1
well	1
what	1
my	1
duty	1
is;	1
help	1
me	1
to	1
bed,	1
for	1
I	1
don’t	1
feel	1
very	1
well;	1
and	1
rest	1
assured	1
that,	1
knight-errant	1
now	1
or	1
wandering	1
shepherd	1
to	1
be,	1
I	1
shall	1
never	1
fail	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
care	1
for	1
your	1
interests,	1
as	1
you	1
will	1
see	1
in	1
the	1
end.”	1
And	1
the	1
good	1
wenches	1
(for	1
that	1
they	1
undoubtedly	1
were),	1
the	1
housekeeper	1
and	1
niece,	1
helped	1
him	1
to	1
bed,	1
where	1
they	1
gave	1
him	1
something	1
to	1
eat	1
and	1
made	1
him	1
as	1
comfortable	1
as	1
possible.	1

all	1

Don	1
Quixote’s	1
enjoyed	1
no	1
special	1
dispensation	1
from	1
heaven	1
to	1
stay	1
its	1
course,	1
its	1
end	1
and	1
close	1
came	1
when	1
he	1
least	1
looked	1
for	1
it.	1
For—whether	1
it	1
was	1
of	1
the	1
dejection	1
the	1
thought	1
of	1
his	1
defeat	1
produced,	1
or	1
of	1
heaven’s	1
will	1
that	1
so	1
ordered	1
it—a	1
fever	1
settled	1
upon	1
him	1
and	1
kept	1
him	1
in	1
his	1
bed	1
for	1
six	1
days,	1
during	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
often	1
visited	1
by	1
his	1
friends	1
the	1
curate,	1
the	1
bachelor,	1
and	1
the	1
barber,	1
while	1
his	1
good	1
squire	1
Sancho	1
Panza	1
never	1
quitted	1
his	1
bedside.	1
They,	1
persuaded	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
grief	1
at	1
finding	1
himself	1
vanquished,	1
and	1
the	1
object	1
of	1
his	1
heart,	1
the	1
liberation	1
and	1
disenchantment	1
of	1
Dulcinea,	1
unattained,	1
that	1
kept	1
him	1
in	1
this	1
state,	1
strove	1
by	1
all	1
the	1
means	1
in	1
their	1
power	1
to	1
cheer	1
him	1
up;	1
the	1
bachelor	1
bidding	1
him	1
take	1
heart	1
and	1
get	1
up	1
to	1
begin	1
his	1
pastoral	1
life,	1
for	1
which	1
he	1
himself,	1
he	1
said,	1
had	1
already	1
composed	1
an	1
eclogue	1
that	1
would	1
take	1
the	1
shine	1
out	1
of	1
all	1
Sannazaro	1
had	1
ever	1
written,	1
and	1
had	1
bought	1
with	1
his	1
own	1
money	1
two	1
famous	1
dogs	1
to	1
guard	1
the	1
flock,	1
one	1
called	1
Barcino	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
Butron,	1
which	1
a	1
herdsman	1
of	1
Quintanar	1
had	1
sold	1
him.	1
But	1
for	1
all	1
this	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
could	1
not	1
shake	1
off	1
his	1
sadness.	1
His	1
friends	1
called	1
in	1
the	1
doctor,	1
who	1
felt	1
his	1
pulse	1
and	1
was	1
not	1
very	1
well	1
satisfied	1
with	1
it,	1
and	1
said	1
that	1
in	1
any	1
case	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
well	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
attend	1
to	1
the	1
health	1
of	1
his	1
soul,	1
as	1
that	1
of	1
his	1
body	1
was	1
in	1
a	1
bad	1
way.	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
heard	1
this	1
calmly;	1
but	1
not	1
so	1
his	1
housekeeper,	1
his	1
niece,	1
and	1
his	1
squire,	1
who	1
fell	1
weeping	1
bitterly,	1
as	1
if	1
they	1
had	1
him	1
lying	1
dead	1
before	1
them.	1
The	1
doctor’s	1
opinion	1
was	1
that	1
melancholy	1
and	1
depression	1
were	1
bringing	1
him	1
to	1
his	1
end.	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
begged	1
them	1
to	1
leave	1
him	1
to	1
himself,	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
a	1
wish	1
to	1
sleep	1
a	1
little.	1
They	1
obeyed,	1
and	1
he	1
slept	1
at	1
one	1
stretch,	1
as	1
the	1
saying	1
is,	1
more	1
than	1
six	1
hours,	1
so	1
that	1
the	1
housekeeper	1
and	1
niece	1
thought	1
he	1
was	1
going	1
to	1
sleep	1
for	1
ever.	1
But	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
that	1
time	1
he	1
woke	1
up,	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
loud	1
voice	1
exclaimed,	1
“Blessed	1
be	1
Almighty	1
God,	1
who	1
has	1
shown	1
me	1
such	1
goodness.	1
In	1
truth	1
his	1
mercies	1
are	1
boundless,	1
and	1
the	1
sins	1
of	1
men	1
can	1
neither	1
limit	1
them	1
nor	1
keep	1
them	1
back!”	1
The	1
niece	1
listened	1
with	1
attention	1
to	1
her	1
uncle’s	1
words,	1
and	1
they	1
struck	1
her	1
as	1
more	1
coherent	1
than	1
what	1
usually	1
fell	1
from	1
him,	1
at	1
least	1
during	1
his	1
illness,	1
so	1
she	1
asked,	1
“What	1
are	1
you	1
saying,	1
señor?	1
Has	1
anything	1
strange	1
occurred?	1
What	1
mercies	1
or	1
what	1
sins	1
of	1
men	1
are	1
you	1
talking	1
of?”	1
“The	1
mercies,	1
niece,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“are	1
those	1
that	1
God	1
has	1
this	1
moment	1
shown	1
me,	1
and	1
with	1
him,	1
as	1
I	1
said,	1
my	1
sins	1
are	1
no	1
impediment	1
to	1
them.	1
My	1
reason	1
is	1
now	1
free	1
and	1
clear,	1
rid	1
of	1
the	1
dark	1
shadows	1
of	1
ignorance	1
that	1
my	1
unhappy	1
constant	1
study	1
of	1
those	1
detestable	1
books	1
of	1
chivalry	1
cast	1
over	1
it.	1
Now	1
I	1
see	1
through	1
their	1
absurdities	1
and	1
deceptions,	1
and	1
it	1
only	1
grieves	1
me	1
that	1
this	1
destruction	1
of	1
my	1
illusions	1
has	1
come	1
so	1
late	1
that	1
it	1
leaves	1
me	1
no	1
time	1
to	1
make	1
some	1
amends	1
by	1
reading	1
other	1
books	1
that	1
might	1
be	1
a	1
light	1
to	1
my	1
soul.	1
Niece,	1
I	1
feel	1
myself	1
at	1
the	1
point	1
of	1
death,	1
and	1
I	1
would	1
fain	1
meet	1
it	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
way	1
as	1
to	1
show	1
that	1
my	1
life	1
has	1
not	1
been	1
so	1
ill	1
that	1
I	1
should	1
leave	1
behind	1
me	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
a	1
madman;	1
for	1
though	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
one,	1
I	1
would	1
not	1
that	1
the	1
fact	1
should	1
be	1
made	1
plainer	1
at	1
my	1
death.	1
Call	1
in	1
to	1
me,	1
my	1
dear,	1
my	1
good	1
friends	1
the	1
curate,	1
the	1
bachelor	1
Samson	1
Carrasco,	1
and	1
Master	1
Nicholas	1
the	1
barber,	1
for	1
I	1
wish	1
to	1
confess	1
and	1
make	1
my	1
will.”	1
But	1
his	1
niece	1
was	1
saved	1
the	1
trouble	1
by	1
the	1
entrance	1
of	1
the	1
three.	1
The	1
instant	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
saw	1
them	1
he	1
exclaimed,	1
“Good	1
news	1
for	1
you,	1
good	1
sirs,	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
no	1
longer	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
of	1
La	1
Mancha,	1
but	1
Alonso	1
Quixano,	1
whose	1
way	1
of	1
life	1
won	1
for	1
him	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
Good.	1
Now	1
am	1
I	1
the	1
enemy	1
of	1
Amadis	1
of	1
Gaul	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
whole	1
countless	1
troop	1
of	1
his	1
descendants;	1
odious	1
to	1
me	1
now	1
are	1
all	1
the	1
profane	1
stories	1
of	1
knight-errantry;	1
now	1
I	1
perceive	1
my	1
folly,	1
and	1
the	1
peril	1
into	1
which	1
reading	1
them	1
brought	1
me;	1
now,	1
by	1
God’s	1
mercy	1
schooled	1
into	1
my	1
right	1
senses,	1
I	1
loathe	1
them.”	1
When	1
the	1
three	1
heard	1
him	1
speak	1
in	1
this	1
way,	1
they	1
had	1
no	1
doubt	1
whatever	1
that	1
some	1
new	1
craze	1
had	1
taken	1
possession	1
of	1
him;	1
and	1
said	1
Samson,	1
“What?	1
Señor	1
Don	1
Quixote!	1
Now	1
that	1
we	1
have	1
intelligence	1
of	1
the	1
lady	1
Dulcinea	1
being	1
disenchanted,	1
are	1
you	1
taking	1
this	1
line;	1
now,	1
just	1
as	1
we	1
are	1
on	1
the	1
point	1
of	1
becoming	1
shepherds,	1
to	1
pass	1
our	1
lives	1
singing,	1
like	1
princes,	1
are	1
you	1
thinking	1
of	1
turning	1
hermit?	1
Hush,	1
for	1
heaven’s	1
sake,	1
be	1
rational	1
and	1
let’s	1
have	1
no	1
more	1
nonsense.”	1
“All	1
that	1
nonsense,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“that	1
until	1
now	1
has	1
been	1
a	1
reality	1
to	1
my	1
hurt,	1
my	1
death	1
will,	1
with	1
heaven’s	1
help,	1
turn	1
to	1
my	1
good.	1
I	1
feel,	1
sirs,	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
rapidly	1
drawing	1
near	1
death;	1
a	1
truce	1
to	1
jesting;	1
let	1
me	1
have	1
a	1
confessor	1
to	1
confess	1
me,	1
and	1
a	1
notary	1
to	1
make	1
my	1
will;	1
for	1
in	1
extremities	1
like	1
this,	1
man	1
must	1
not	1
trifle	1
with	1
his	1
soul;	1
and	1
while	1
the	1
curate	1
is	1
confessing	1
me	1
let	1
someone,	1
I	1
beg,	1
go	1
for	1
the	1
notary.”	1
They	1
looked	1
at	1
one	1
another,	1
wondering	1
at	1
Don	1
Quixote’s	1
words;	1
but,	1
though	1
uncertain,	1
they	1
were	1
inclined	1
to	1
believe	1
him,	1
and	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
signs	1
by	1
which	1
they	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
conclusion	1
he	1
was	1
dying	1
was	1
this	1
so	1
sudden	1
and	1
complete	1
return	1
to	1
his	1
senses	1
after	1
having	1
been	1
mad;	1
for	1
to	1
the	1
words	1
already	1
quoted	1
he	1
added	1
much	1
more,	1
so	1
well	1
expressed,	1
so	1
devout,	1
and	1
so	1
rational,	1
as	1
to	1
banish	1
all	1
doubt	1
and	1
convince	1
them	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
sound	1
of	1
mind.	1
The	1
curate	1
turned	1
them	1
all	1
out,	1
and	1
left	1
alone	1
with	1
him	1
confessed	1
him.	1
The	1
bachelor	1
went	1
for	1
the	1
notary	1
and	1
returned	1
shortly	1
afterwards	1
with	1
him	1
and	1
with	1
Sancho,	1
who,	1
having	1
already	1
learned	1
from	1
the	1
bachelor	1
the	1
condition	1
his	1
master	1
was	1
in,	1
and	1
finding	1
the	1
housekeeper	1
and	1
niece	1
weeping,	1
began	1
to	1
blubber	1
and	1
shed	1
tears.	1
The	1
confession	1
over,	1
the	1
curate	1
came	1
out	1
saying,	1
“Alonso	1
Quixano	1
the	1
Good	1
is	1
indeed	1
dying,	1
and	1
is	1
indeed	1
in	1
his	1
right	1
mind;	1
we	1
may	1
now	1
go	1
in	1
to	1
him	1
while	1
he	1
makes	1
his	1
will.”	1
This	1
news	1
gave	1
a	1
tremendous	1
impulse	1
to	1
the	1
brimming	1
eyes	1
of	1
the	1
housekeeper,	1
niece,	1
and	1
Sancho	1
Panza	1
his	1
good	1
squire,	1
making	1
the	1
tears	1
burst	1
from	1
their	1
eyes	1
and	1
a	1
host	1
of	1
sighs	1
from	1
their	1
hearts;	1
for	1
of	1
a	1
truth,	1
as	1
has	1
been	1
said	1
more	1
than	1
once,	1
whether	1
as	1
plain	1
Alonso	1
Quixano	1
the	1
Good,	1
or	1
as	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
of	1
La	1
Mancha,	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
was	1
always	1
of	1
a	1
gentle	1
disposition	1
and	1
kindly	1
in	1
all	1
his	1
ways,	1
and	1
hence	1
he	1
was	1
beloved,	1
not	1
only	1
by	1
those	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
house,	1
but	1
by	1
all	1
who	1
knew	1
him.	1
The	1
notary	1
came	1
in	1
with	1
the	1
rest,	1
and	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
the	1
preamble	1
of	1
the	1
will	1
had	1
been	1
set	1
out	1
and	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
had	1
commended	1
his	1
soul	1
to	1
God	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
devout	1
formalities	1
that	1
are	1
usual,	1
coming	1
to	1
the	1
bequests,	1
he	1
said,	1
“Item,	1
it	1
is	1
my	1
will	1
that,	1
touching	1
certain	1
moneys	1
in	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
Sancho	1
Panza	1
(whom	1
in	1
my	1
madness	1
I	1
made	1
my	1
squire),	1
inasmuch	1
as	1
between	1
him	1
and	1
me	1
there	1
have	1
been	1
certain	1
accounts	1
and	1
debits	1
and	1
credits,	1
no	1
claim	1
be	1
made	1
against	1
him,	1
nor	1
any	1
account	1
demanded	1
of	1
him	1
in	1
respect	1
of	1
them;	1
but	1
that	1
if	1
anything	1
remain	1
over	1
and	1
above,	1
after	1
he	1
has	1
paid	1
himself	1
what	1
I	1
owe	1
him,	1
the	1
balance,	1
which	1
will	1
be	1
but	1
little,	1
shall	1
be	1
his,	1
and	1
much	1
good	1
may	1
it	1
do	1
him;	1
and	1
if,	1
as	1
when	1
I	1
was	1
mad	1
I	1
had	1
a	1
share	1
in	1
giving	1
him	1
the	1
government	1
of	1
an	1
island,	1
so,	1
now	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
in	1
my	1
senses,	1
I	1
could	1
give	1
him	1
that	1
of	1
a	1
kingdom,	1
it	1
should	1
be	1
his,	1
for	1
the	1
simplicity	1
of	1
his	1
character	1
and	1
the	1
fidelity	1
of	1
his	1
conduct	1
deserve	1
it.”	1
And	1
then,	1
turning	1
to	1
Sancho,	1
he	1
said,	1
“Forgive	1
me,	1
my	1
friend,	1
that	1
I	1
led	1
thee	1
to	1
seem	1
as	1
mad	1
as	1
myself,	1
making	1
thee	1
fall	1
into	1
the	1
same	1
error	1
I	1
myself	1
fell	1
into,	1
that	1
there	1
were	1
and	1
still	1
are	1
knights-errant	1
in	1
the	1
world.”	1
“Ah!”	1
said	1
Sancho	1
weeping,	1
“don’t	1
die,	1
master,	1
but	1
take	1
my	1
advice	1
and	1
live	1
many	1
years;	1
for	1
the	1
foolishest	1
thing	1
a	1
man	1
can	1
do	1
in	1
this	1
life	1
is	1
to	1
let	1
himself	1
die	1
without	1
rhyme	1
or	1
reason,	1
without	1
anybody	1
killing	1
him,	1
or	1
any	1
hands	1
but	1
melancholy’s	1
making	1
an	1
end	1
of	1
him.	1
Come,	1
don’t	1
be	1
lazy,	1
but	1
get	1
up	1
from	1
your	1
bed	1
and	1
let	1
us	1
take	1
to	1
the	1
fields	1
in	1
shepherd’s	1
trim	1
as	1
we	1
agreed.	1
Perhaps	1
behind	1
some	1
bush	1
we	1
shall	1
find	1
the	1
lady	1
Dulcinea	1
disenchanted,	1
as	1
fine	1
as	1
fine	1
can	1
be.	1
If	1
it	1
be	1
that	1
you	1
are	1
dying	1
of	1
vexation	1
at	1
having	1
been	1
vanquished,	1
lay	1
the	1
blame	1
on	1
me,	1
and	1
say	1
you	1
were	1
overthrown	1
because	1
I	1
had	1
girthed	1
Rocinante	1
badly;	1
besides	1
you	1
must	1
have	1
seen	1
in	1
your	1
books	1
of	1
chivalry	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
common	1
thing	1
for	1
knights	1
to	1
upset	1
one	1
another,	1
and	1
for	1
him	1
who	1
is	1
conquered	1
to-day	1
to	1
be	1
conqueror	1
to-morrow.”	1
“Very	1
true,”	1
said	1
Samson,	1
“and	1
good	1
Sancho	1
Panza’s	1
view	1
of	1
these	1
cases	1
is	1
quite	1
right.”	1
“Sirs,	1
not	1
so	1
fast,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“‘in	1
last	1
year’s	1
nests	1
there	1
are	1
no	1
birds	1
this	1
year.’	1
I	1
was	1
mad,	1
now	1
I	1
am	1
in	1
my	1
senses;	1
I	1
was	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
of	1
La	1
Mancha,	1
I	1
am	1
now,	1
as	1
I	1
said,	1
Alonso	1
Quixano	1
the	1
Good;	1
and	1
may	1
my	1
repentance	1
and	1
sincerity	1
restore	1
me	1
to	1
the	1
esteem	1
you	1
used	1
to	1
have	1
for	1
me;	1
and	1
now	1
let	1
Master	1
Notary	1
proceed.	1
“Item,	1
I	1
leave	1
all	1
my	1
property	1
absolutely	1
to	1
Antonia	1
Quixana	1
my	1
niece,	1
here	1
present,	1
after	1
all	1
has	1
been	1
deducted	1
from	1
the	1
most	1
available	1
portion	1
of	1
it	1
that	1
may	1
be	1
required	1
to	1
satisfy	1
the	1
bequests	1
I	1
have	1
made.	1
And	1
the	1
first	1
disbursement	1
I	1
desire	1
to	1
be	1
made	1
is	1
the	1
payment	1
of	1
the	1
wages	1
I	1
owe	1
for	1
the	1
time	1
my	1
housekeeper	1
has	1
served	1
me,	1
with	1
twenty	1
ducats,	1
over	1
and	1
above,	1
for	1
a	1
gown.	1
The	1
curate	1
and	1
the	1
bachelor	1
Samson	1
Carrasco,	1
now	1
present,	1
I	1
appoint	1
my	1
executors.	1
“Item,	1
it	1
is	1
my	1
wish	1
that	1
if	1
Antonia	1
Quixana,	1
my	1
niece,	1
desires	1
to	1
marry,	1
she	1
shall	1
marry	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
whom	1
it	1
shall	1
be	1
first	1
of	1
all	1
ascertained	1
by	1
information	1
taken	1
that	1
he	1
does	1
not	1
know	1
what	1
books	1
of	1
chivalry	1
are;	1
and	1
if	1
it	1
should	1
be	1
proved	1
that	1
he	1
does,	1
and	1
if,	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
this,	1
my	1
niece	1
insists	1
upon	1
marrying	1
him,	1
and	1
does	1
marry	1
him,	1
then	1
that	1
she	1
shall	1
forfeit	1
the	1
whole	1
of	1
what	1
I	1
have	1
left	1
her,	1
which	1
my	1
executors	1
shall	1
devote	1
to	1
works	1
of	1
charity	1
as	1
they	1
please.	1
“Item,	1
I	1
entreat	1
the	1
aforesaid	1
gentlemen	1
my	1
executors,	1
that,	1
if	1
any	1
happy	1
chance	1
should	1
lead	1
them	1
to	1
discover	1
the	1
author	1
who	1
is	1
said	1
to	1
have	1
written	1
a	1
history	1
now	1
going	1
about	1
under	1
the	1
title	1
of	1
‘Second	1
Part	1
of	1
the	1
Achievements	1
of	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
of	1
La	1
Mancha,’	1
they	1
beg	1
of	1
him	1
on	1
my	1
behalf	1
as	1
earnestly	1
as	1
they	1
can	1
to	1
forgive	1
me	1
for	1
having	1
been,	1
without	1
intending	1
it,	1
the	1
cause	1
of	1
his	1
writing	1
so	1
many	1
and	1
such	1
monstrous	1
absurdities	1
as	1
he	1
has	1
written	1
in	1
it;	1
for	1
I	1
am	1
leaving	1
the	1
world	1
with	1
a	1
feeling	1
of	1
compunction	1
at	1
having	1
provoked	1
him	1
to	1
write	1
them.”	1
With	1
this	1
he	1
closed	1
his	1
will,	1
and	1
a	1
faintness	1
coming	1
over	1
him	1
he	1
stretched	1
himself	1
out	1
at	1
full	1
length	1
on	1
the	1
bed.	1
All	1
were	1
in	1
a	1
flutter	1
and	1
made	1
haste	1
to	1
relieve	1
him,	1
and	1
during	1
the	1
three	1
days	1
he	1
lived	1
after	1
that	1
on	1
which	1
he	1
made	1
his	1
will	1
he	1
fainted	1
away	1
very	1
often.	1
The	1
house	1
was	1
all	1
in	1
confusion;	1
but	1
still	1
the	1
niece	1
ate	1
and	1
the	1
housekeeper	1
drank	1
and	1
Sancho	1
Panza	1
enjoyed	1
himself;	1
for	1
inheriting	1
property	1
wipes	1
out	1
or	1
softens	1
down	1
in	1
the	1
heir	1
the	1
feeling	1
of	1
grief	1
the	1
dead	1
man	1
might	1
be	1
expected	1
to	1
leave	1
behind	1
him.	1

At	1
last	1
Don	1
Quixote’s	1
end	1
came,	1
after	1
he	1
had	1
received	1
all	1
the	1
sacraments,	1
and	1
had	1
in	1
full	1
and	1
forcible	1
terms	1
expressed	1
his	1
detestation	1
of	1
books	1
of	1
chivalry.	1
The	1
notary	1
was	1
there	1
at	1
the	1
time,	1
and	1
he	1
said	1
that	1
in	1
no	1
book	1
of	1
chivalry	1
had	1
he	1
ever	1
read	1
of	1
any	1
knight-errant	1
dying	1
in	1
his	1
bed	1
so	1
calmly	1
and	1
so	1
like	1
a	1
Christian	1
as	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
who	1
amid	1
the	1
tears	1
and	1
lamentations	1
of	1
all	1
present	1
yielded	1
up	1
his	1
spirit,	1
that	1
is	1
to	1
say	1
died.	1
On	1
perceiving	1
it	1
the	1
curate	1
begged	1
the	1
notary	1
to	1
bear	1
witness	1
that	1
Alonso	1
Quixano	1
the	1
Good,	1
commonly	1
called	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
of	1
La	1
Mancha,	1
had	1
passed	1
away	1
from	1
this	1
present	1
life,	1
and	1
died	1
naturally;	1
and	1
said	1
he	1
desired	1
this	1
testimony	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
remove	1
the	1
possibility	1
of	1
any	1
other	1
author	1
save	1
Cide	1
Hamete	1
Benengeli	1
bringing	1
him	1
to	1
life	1
again	1
falsely	1
and	1
making	1
interminable	1
stories	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
achievements.	1
Such	1
was	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
Ingenious	1
Gentleman	1
of	1
La	1
Mancha,	1
whose	1
village	1
Cide	1
Hamete	1
would	1
not	1
indicate	1
precisely,	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
leave	1
all	1
the	1
towns	1
and	1
villages	1
of	1
La	1
Mancha	1
to	1
contend	1
among	1
themselves	1
for	1
the	1
right	1
to	1
adopt	1
him	1
and	1
claim	1
him	1
as	1
a	1
son,	1
as	1
the	1
seven	1
cities	1
of	1
Greece	1
contended	1
for	1
Homer.	1
The	1
lamentations	1
of	1
Sancho	1
and	1
the	1
niece	1
and	1
housekeeper	1
are	1
omitted	1
here,	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
the	1
new	1
epitaphs	1
upon	1
his	1
tomb;	1
Samson	1
Carrasco,	1
however,	1
put	1
the	1
following	1
lines:	1
A	1
doughty	1
gentleman	1
lies	1
here;	1
A	1
stranger	1
all	1
his	1
life	1
to	1
fear;	1
Nor	1
in	1
his	1
death	1
could	1
Death	1
prevail,	1
In	1
that	1
last	1
hour,	1
to	1
make	1
him	1
quail.	1
He	1
for	1
the	1
world	1
but	1
little	1
cared;	1
And	1
at	1
his	1
feats	1
the	1
world	1
was	1
scared;	1
A	1
crazy	1
man	1
his	1
life	1
he	1
passed,	1
But	1
in	1
his	1
senses	1
died	1
at	1
last.	1
And	1
said	1
most	1
sage	1
Cide	1
Hamete	1
to	1
his	1
pen,	1
“Rest	1
here,	1
hung	1
up	1
by	1
this	1
brass	1
wire,	1
upon	1
this	1
shelf,	1
O	1
my	1
pen,	1
whether	1
of	1
skilful	1
make	1
or	1
clumsy	1
cut	1
I	1
know	1
not;	1
here	1
shalt	1
thou	1
remain	1
long	1
ages	1
hence,	1
unless	1
presumptuous	1
or	1
malignant	1
story-tellers	1
take	1
thee	1
down	1
to	1
profane	1
thee.	1
But	1
ere	1
they	1
touch	1
thee	1
warn	1
them,	1
and,	1
as	1
best	1
thou	1
canst,	1
say	1
to	1
them:	1
Hold	1
off!	1
ye	1
weaklings;	1
hold	1
your	1
hands!	1
Adventure	1
it	1
let	1
none,	1
For	1
this	1
emprise,	1
my	1
lord	1
the	1
king,	1
Was	1
meant	1
for	1
me	1
alone.	1
For	1
me	1
alone	1
was	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
born,	1
and	1
I	1
for	1
him;	1
it	1
was	1
his	1
to	1
act,	1
mine	1
to	1
write;	1
we	1
two	1
together	1
make	1
but	1
one,	1
notwithstanding	1
and	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
that	1
pretended	1
Tordesillesque	1
writer	1
who	1
has	1
ventured	1
or	1
would	1
venture	1
with	1
his	1
great,	1
coarse,	1
ill-trimmed	1
ostrich	1
quill	1
to	1
write	1
the	1
achievements	1
of	1
my	1
valiant	1
knight;—no	1
burden	1
for	1
his	1
shoulders,	1
nor	1
subject	1
for	1
his	1
frozen	1
wit:	1
whom,	1
if	1
perchance	1
thou	1
shouldst	1
come	1
to	1
know	1
him,	1
thou	1
shalt	1
warn	1
to	1
leave	1
at	1
rest	1
where	1
they	1
lie	1
the	1
weary	1
mouldering	1
bones	1
of	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
and	1
not	1
to	1
attempt	1
to	1
carry	1
him	1
off,	1
in	1
opposition	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
privileges	1
of	1
death,	1
to	1
Old	1
Castile,	1
making	1
him	1
rise	1
from	1
the	1
grave	1
where	1
in	1
reality	1
and	1
truth	1
he	1
lies	1
stretched	1
at	1
full	1
length,	1
powerless	1
to	1
make	1
any	1
third	1
expedition	1
or	1
new	1
sally;	1
for	1
the	1
two	1
that	1
he	1
has	1
already	1
made,	1
so	1
much	1
to	1
the	1
enjoyment	1
and	1
approval	1
of	1
everybody	1
to	1
whom	1
they	1
have	1
become	1
known,	1
in	1
this	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
in	1
foreign	1
countries,	1
are	1
quite	1
sufficient	1
for	1
the	1
purpose	1
of	1
turning	1
into	1
ridicule	1
the	1
whole	1
of	1
those	1
made	1
by	1
the	1
whole	1
set	1
of	1
the	1
knights-errant;	1
and	1
so	1
doing	1
shalt	1
thou	1
discharge	1
thy	1
Christian	1
calling,	1
giving	1
good	1
counsel	1
to	1
one	1
that	1
bears	1
ill-will	1
to	1
thee.	1
And	1
I	1
shall	1
remain	1
satisfied,	1
and	1
proud	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
the	1
first	1
who	1
has	1
ever	1
enjoyed	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
his	1
writings	1
as	1
fully	1
as	1
he	1
could	1
desire;	1
for	1
my	1
desire	1
has	1
been	1
no	1
other	1
than	1
to	1
deliver	1
over	1
to	1
the	1
detestation	1
of	1
mankind	1
the	1
false	1
and	1
foolish	1
tales	1
of	1
the	1
books	1
of	1
chivalry,	1
which,	1
thanks	1
to	1
that	1
of	1
my	1
true	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
are	1
even	1
now	1
tottering,	1
and	1
doubtless	1
doomed	1
to	1
fall	1
for	1
ever.	1
Farewell.”	1

a	1

that	1
could	1

anyone.	1
For	1

eBooks	1
are	1
often	1

are	1
confirmed	1
