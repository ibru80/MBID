Note	1
The	1
book	1
cover	1
and	1
spine	1
above	1
and	1
the	1
images	1
which	1
follow	1
were	1
not	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
original	1
Ormsby	1
translation—they	1
are	1
taken	1
from	1
the	1
1880	1
edition	1
of	1
J.	1
W.	1
Clark,	1
illustrated	1
by	1
Gustave	1
Doré.	1
Clark	1
in	1
his	1
edition	1
states	1
that,	1
“The	1
English	1
text	1
of	1
‘Don	1
Quixote’	1
adopted	1
in	1
this	1
edition	1
is	1
that	1
of	1
Jarvis,	1
with	1
occasional	1
corrections	1
from	1
Motteaux.”	1
See	1
in	1
the	1
introduction	1
below	1
John	1
Ormsby’s	1
critique	1
of	1
both	1
the	1
Jarvis	1
and	1
Motteaux	1
translations.	1
It	1
has	1
been	1
elected	1
in	1
the	1
present	1
Project	1
Gutenberg	1
edition	1
to	1
attach	1
the	1
famous	1
engravings	1
of	1
Gustave	1
Doré	1
to	1
the	1
Ormsby	1
translation	1
instead	1
of	1
the	1
Jarvis/Motteaux.	1
The	1
detail	1
of	1
many	1
of	1
the	1
Doré	1
engravings	1
can	1
be	1
fully	1
appreciated	1
only	1
by	1
utilizing	1
the	1
“Full	1

button	1
to	1
expand	1
them	1
to	1
their	1
original	1
dimensions.	1
Ormsby	1
in	1
his	1
Preface	1
has	1
criticized	1
the	1
fanciful	1
nature	1
of	1
Doré’s	1
illustrations;	1
others	1
feel	1
these	1
woodcuts	1
and	1
steel	1
engravings	1
well	1
match	1
Quixote’s	1
dreams.	1

INTRODUCTION	1
PREFARATORY	1
It	1
was	1
with	1
considerable	1
reluctance	1
that	1
I	1
abandoned	1
in	1
favour	1
of	1
the	1
present	1
undertaking	1
what	1
had	1
long	1
been	1
a	1
favourite	1
project:	1
that	1
of	1
a	1
new	1
edition	1
of	1
Shelton’s	1
“Don	1
Quixote,”	1
which	1
has	1
now	1
become	1
a	1
somewhat	1
scarce	1
book.	1
There	1
are	1
some—and	1
I	1
confess	1
myself	1
to	1
be	1
one—for	1
whom	1
Shelton’s	1
racy	1
old	1
version,	1
with	1
all	1
its	1
defects,	1
has	1
a	1
charm	1
that	1
no	1
modern	1
translation,	1
however	1
skilful	1
or	1
correct,	1
could	1
possess.	1
Shelton	1
had	1
the	1
inestimable	1
advantage	1
of	1
belonging	1
to	1
the	1
same	1
generation	1
as	1
Cervantes;	1
“Don	1
Quixote”	1
had	1
to	1
him	1
a	1
vitality	1
that	1
only	1
a	1
contemporary	1
could	1
feel;	1
it	1
cost	1
him	1
no	1
dramatic	1
effort	1
to	1
see	1
things	1
as	1
Cervantes	1
saw	1
them;	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
anachronism	1
in	1
his	1
language;	1
he	1
put	1
the	1
Spanish	1
of	1
Cervantes	1
into	1
the	1
English	1
of	1
Shakespeare.	1
Shakespeare	1
himself	1
most	1
likely	1
knew	1
the	1
book;	1
he	1
may	1
have	1
carried	1
it	1
home	1
with	1
him	1
in	1
his	1
saddle-bags	1
to	1
Stratford	1
on	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
last	1
journeys,	1
and	1
under	1
the	1
mulberry	1
tree	1
at	1
New	1
Place	1
joined	1
hands	1
with	1
a	1
kindred	1
genius	1
in	1
its	1
pages.	1
But	1
it	1
was	1
soon	1
made	1
plain	1
to	1
me	1
that	1
to	1
hope	1
for	1
even	1
a	1
moderate	1
popularity	1
for	1
Shelton	1
was	1
vain.	1
His	1
fine	1
old	1
crusted	1
English	1
would,	1
no	1
doubt,	1
be	1
relished	1
by	1
a	1
minority,	1
but	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
only	1
by	1
a	1
minority.	1
His	1
warmest	1
admirers	1
must	1
admit	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
satisfactory	1
representative	1
of	1
Cervantes.	1
His	1
translation	1
of	1
the	1
First	1
Part	1
was	1
very	1
hastily	1
made	1
and	1
was	1
never	1
revised	1
by	1
him.	1
It	1
has	1
all	1
the	1
freshness	1
and	1
vigour,	1
but	1
also	1
a	1
full	1
measure	1
of	1
the	1
faults,	1
of	1
a	1
hasty	1
production.	1
It	1
is	1
often	1
very	1
literal—barbarously	1
literal	1
frequently—but	1
just	1
as	1
often	1
very	1
loose.	1
He	1
had	1
evidently	1
a	1
good	1
colloquial	1
knowledge	1
of	1
Spanish,	1
but	1
apparently	1
not	1
much	1
more.	1
It	1
never	1
seems	1
to	1
occur	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
the	1
same	1
translation	1
of	1
a	1
word	1
will	1
not	1
suit	1
in	1
every	1
case.	1
It	1
is	1
often	1
said	1
that	1
we	1
have	1
no	1
satisfactory	1
translation	1
of	1
“Don	1
Quixote.”	1
To	1
those	1
who	1
are	1
familiar	1
with	1
the	1
original,	1
it	1
savours	1
of	1
truism	1
or	1
platitude	1
to	1
say	1
so,	1
for	1
in	1
truth	1
there	1
can	1
be	1
no	1
thoroughly	1
satisfactory	1
translation	1
of	1
“Don	1
Quixote”	1
into	1
English	1
or	1
any	1
other	1
language.	1
It	1
is	1
not	1
that	1
the	1
Spanish	1
idioms	1
are	1
so	1
utterly	1
unmanageable,	1
or	1
that	1
the	1
untranslatable	1
words,	1
numerous	1
enough	1
no	1
doubt,	1
are	1
so	1
superabundant,	1
but	1
rather	1
that	1
the	1
sententious	1
terseness	1
to	1
which	1
the	1
humour	1
of	1
the	1
book	1
owes	1
its	1
flavour	1
is	1
peculiar	1
to	1
Spanish,	1
and	1
can	1
at	1
best	1
be	1
only	1
distantly	1
imitated	1
in	1
any	1
other	1
tongue.	1
The	1
history	1
of	1
our	1
English	1
translations	1
of	1
“Don	1
Quixote”	1
is	1
instructive.	1
Shelton’s,	1
the	1
first	1
in	1
any	1
language,	1
was	1
made,	1
apparently,	1
about	1
1608,	1
but	1
not	1
published	1
till	1
1612.	1
This	1
of	1
course	1
was	1
only	1
the	1
First	1
Part.	1
It	1
has	1
been	1
asserted	1
that	1
the	1
Second,	1
published	1
in	1
1620,	1
is	1
not	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
Shelton,	1
but	1
there	1
is	1
nothing	1
to	1
support	1
the	1
assertion	1
save	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
it	1
has	1
less	1
spirit,	1
less	1
of	1
what	1
we	1
generally	1
understand	1
by	1
“go,”	1
about	1
it	1
than	1
the	1
first,	1
which	1
would	1
be	1
only	1
natural	1
if	1
the	1
first	1
were	1
the	1
work	1
of	1
a	1
young	1
man	1
writing	1
_currente	1
calamo_,	1
and	1
the	1
second	1
that	1
of	1
a	1
middle-aged	1
man	1
writing	1
for	1
a	1
bookseller.	1
On	1
the	1
other	1
hand,	1
it	1
is	1
closer	1
and	1
more	1
literal,	1
the	1
style	1
is	1
the	1
same,	1
the	1
very	1
same	1
translations,	1
or	1
mistranslations,	1
occur	1
in	1
it,	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
extremely	1
unlikely	1
that	1
a	1
new	1
translator	1
would,	1
by	1
suppressing	1
his	1
name,	1
have	1
allowed	1
Shelton	1
to	1
carry	1
off	1
the	1
credit.	1
In	1
1687	1
John	1
Phillips,	1
Milton’s	1
nephew,	1
produced	1
a	1
“Don	1
Quixote”	1
“made	1
English,”	1
he	1
says,	1
“according	1
to	1
the	1
humour	1
of	1
our	1
modern	1
language.”	1
His	1
“Quixote”	1
is	1
not	1
so	1
much	1
a	1
translation	1
as	1
a	1
travesty,	1
and	1
a	1
travesty	1
that	1
for	1
coarseness,	1
vulgarity,	1
and	1
buffoonery	1
is	1
almost	1
unexampled	1
even	1
in	1
the	1
literature	1
of	1
that	1
day.	1
Ned	1
Ward’s	1
“Life	1
and	1
Notable	1
Adventures	1
of	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
merrily	1
translated	1
into	1
Hudibrastic	1
Verse”	1
(1700),	1
can	1
scarcely	1
be	1
reckoned	1
a	1
translation,	1
but	1
it	1
serves	1
to	1
show	1
the	1
light	1
in	1
which	1
“Don	1
Quixote”	1
was	1
regarded	1
at	1
the	1
time.	1
A	1
further	1
illustration	1
may	1
be	1
found	1
in	1
the	1
version	1
published	1
in	1
1712	1
by	1
Peter	1
Motteux,	1
who	1
had	1
then	1
recently	1
combined	1
tea-dealing	1
with	1
literature.	1
It	1
is	1
described	1
as	1
“translated	1
from	1
the	1
original	1
by	1
several	1
hands,”	1
but	1
if	1
so	1
all	1
Spanish	1
flavour	1
has	1
entirely	1
evaporated	1
under	1
the	1
manipulation	1
of	1
the	1
several	1
hands.	1
The	1
flavour	1
that	1
it	1
has,	1
on	1
the	1
other	1
hand,	1
is	1
distinctly	1
Franco-cockney.	1
Anyone	1
who	1
compares	1
it	1
carefully	1
with	1
the	1
original	1
will	1
have	1
little	1
doubt	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
concoction	1
from	1
Shelton	1
and	1
the	1
French	1
of	1
Filleau	1
de	1
Saint	1
Martin,	1
eked	1
out	1
by	1
borrowings	1
from	1
Phillips,	1
whose	1
mode	1
of	1
treatment	1
it	1
adopts.	1
It	1
is,	1
to	1
be	1
sure,	1
more	1
decent	1
and	1
decorous,	1
but	1
it	1
treats	1
“Don	1
Quixote”	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
fashion	1
as	1
a	1
comic	1
book	1
that	1
cannot	1
be	1
made	1
too	1
comic.	1
To	1
attempt	1
to	1
improve	1
the	1
humour	1
of	1
“Don	1
Quixote”	1
by	1
an	1
infusion	1
of	1
cockney	1
flippancy	1
and	1
facetiousness,	1
as	1
Motteux’s	1
operators	1
did,	1
is	1
not	1
merely	1
an	1
impertinence	1
like	1
larding	1
a	1
sirloin	1
of	1
prize	1
beef,	1
but	1
an	1
absolute	1
falsification	1
of	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
the	1
book,	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
proof	1
of	1
the	1
uncritical	1
way	1
in	1
which	1
“Don	1
Quixote”	1
is	1
generally	1
read	1
that	1
this	1
worse	1
than	1
worthless	1
translation—worthless	1
as	1
failing	1
to	1
represent,	1
worse	1
than	1
worthless	1
as	1
misrepresenting—should	1
have	1
been	1
favoured	1
as	1
it	1
has	1
been.	1
It	1
had	1
the	1
effect,	1
however,	1
of	1
bringing	1
out	1
a	1
translation	1
undertaken	1
and	1
executed	1
in	1
a	1
very	1
different	1
spirit,	1
that	1
of	1
Charles	1
Jervas,	1
the	1
portrait	1
painter,	1
and	1
friend	1
of	1
Pope,	1
Swift,	1
Arbuthnot,	1
and	1
Gay.	1
Jervas	1
has	1
been	1
allowed	1
little	1
credit	1
for	1
his	1
work,	1
indeed	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
said	1
none,	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
known	1
to	1
the	1
world	1
in	1
general	1
as	1
Jarvis’s.	1
It	1
was	1
not	1
published	1
until	1
after	1
his	1
death,	1
and	1
the	1
printers	1
gave	1
the	1
name	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
current	1
pronunciation	1
of	1
the	1
day.	1
It	1
has	1
been	1
the	1
most	1
freely	1
used	1
and	1
the	1
most	1
freely	1
abused	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
translations.	1
It	1
has	1
seen	1
far	1
more	1
editions	1
than	1
any	1
other,	1
it	1
is	1
admitted	1
on	1
all	1
hands	1
to	1
be	1
by	1
far	1
the	1
most	1
faithful,	1
and	1
yet	1
nobody	1
seems	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
good	1
word	1
to	1
say	1
for	1
it	1
or	1
for	1
its	1
author.	1
Jervas	1
no	1
doubt	1
prejudiced	1
readers	1
against	1
himself	1
in	1
his	1
preface,	1
where	1
among	1
many	1
true	1
words	1
about	1
Shelton,	1
Stevens,	1
and	1
Motteux,	1
he	1
rashly	1
and	1
unjustly	1
charges	1
Shelton	1
with	1
having	1
translated	1
not	1
from	1
the	1
Spanish,	1
but	1
from	1
the	1
Italian	1
version	1
of	1
Franciosini,	1
which	1
did	1
not	1
appear	1
until	1
ten	1
years	1
after	1
Shelton’s	1
first	1
volume.	1
A	1
suspicion	1
of	1
incompetence,	1
too,	1
seems	1
to	1
have	1
attached	1
to	1
him	1
because	1
he	1
was	1
by	1
profession	1
a	1
painter	1
and	1
a	1
mediocre	1
one	1
(though	1
he	1
has	1
given	1
us	1
the	1
best	1
portrait	1
we	1
have	1
of	1
Swift),	1
and	1
this	1
may	1
have	1
been	1
strengthened	1
by	1
Pope’s	1
remark	1
that	1
he	1
“translated	1
‘Don	1
Quixote’	1
without	1
understanding	1
Spanish.”	1
He	1
has	1
been	1
also	1
charged	1
with	1
borrowing	1
from	1
Shelton,	1
whom	1
he	1
disparaged.	1
It	1
is	1
true	1
that	1
in	1
a	1
few	1
difficult	1
or	1
obscure	1
passages	1
he	1
has	1
followed	1
Shelton,	1
and	1
gone	1
astray	1
with	1
him;	1
but	1
for	1
one	1
case	1
of	1
this	1
sort,	1
there	1
are	1
fifty	1
where	1
he	1
is	1
right	1
and	1
Shelton	1
wrong.	1
As	1
for	1
Pope’s	1
dictum,	1
anyone	1
who	1
examines	1
Jervas’s	1
version	1
carefully,	1
side	1
by	1
side	1
with	1
the	1
original,	1
will	1
see	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
sound	1
Spanish	1
scholar,	1
incomparably	1
a	1
better	1
one	1
than	1
Shelton,	1
except	1
perhaps	1
in	1
mere	1
colloquial	1
Spanish.	1
He	1
was,	1
in	1
fact,	1
an	1
honest,	1
faithful,	1
and	1
painstaking	1
translator,	1
and	1
he	1
has	1
left	1
a	1
version	1
which,	1
whatever	1
its	1
shortcomings	1
may	1
be,	1
is	1
singularly	1
free	1
from	1
errors	1
and	1
mistranslations.	1
The	1
charge	1
against	1
it	1
is	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
stiff,	1
dry—“wooden”	1
in	1
a	1
word,—and	1
no	1
one	1
can	1
deny	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
foundation	1
for	1
it.	1
But	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
pleaded	1
for	1
Jervas	1
that	1
a	1
good	1
deal	1
of	1
this	1
rigidity	1
is	1
due	1
to	1
his	1
abhorrence	1
of	1
the	1
light,	1
flippant,	1
jocose	1
style	1
of	1
his	1
predecessors.	1
He	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
few,	1
very	1
few,	1
translators	1
that	1
have	1
shown	1
any	1
apprehension	1
of	1
the	1
unsmiling	1
gravity	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
essence	1
of	1
Quixotic	1
humour;	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
a	1
crime	1
to	1
bring	1
Cervantes	1
forward	1
smirking	1
and	1
grinning	1
at	1
his	1
own	1
good	1
things,	1
and	1
to	1
this	1
may	1
be	1
attributed	1
in	1
a	1
great	1
measure	1
the	1
ascetic	1
abstinence	1
from	1
everything	1
savouring	1
of	1
liveliness	1
which	1
is	1
the	1
characteristic	1
of	1
his	1
translation.	1
In	1
most	1
modern	1
editions,	1
it	1
should	1
be	1
observed,	1
his	1
style	1
has	1
been	1
smoothed	1
and	1
smartened,	1
but	1
without	1
any	1
reference	1
to	1
the	1
original	1
Spanish,	1
so	1
that	1
if	1
he	1
has	1
been	1
made	1
to	1
read	1
more	1
agreeably	1
he	1
has	1
also	1
been	1
robbed	1
of	1
his	1
chief	1
merit	1
of	1
fidelity.	1
Smollett’s	1
version,	1
published	1
in	1
1755,	1
may	1
be	1
almost	1
counted	1
as	1
one	1
of	1
these.	1
At	1
any	1
rate	1
it	1
is	1
plain	1
that	1
in	1
its	1
construction	1
Jervas’s	1
translation	1
was	1
very	1
freely	1
drawn	1
upon,	1
and	1
very	1
little	1
or	1
probably	1
no	1
heed	1
given	1
to	1
the	1
original	1
Spanish.	1
The	1
later	1
translations	1
may	1
be	1
dismissed	1
in	1
a	1
few	1
words.	1
George	1
Kelly’s,	1
which	1
appeared	1
in	1
1769,	1
“printed	1
for	1
the	1
Translator,”	1
was	1
an	1
impudent	1
imposture,	1
being	1
nothing	1
more	1
than	1
Motteux’s	1
version	1
with	1
a	1
few	1
of	1
the	1
words,	1
here	1
and	1
there,	1
artfully	1
transposed;	1
Charles	1
Wilmot’s	1
(1774)	1
was	1
only	1
an	1
abridgment	1
like	1
Florian’s,	1
but	1
not	1
so	1
skilfully	1
executed;	1
and	1
the	1
version	1
published	1
by	1
Miss	1
Smirke	1
in	1
1818,	1
to	1
accompany	1
her	1
brother’s	1
plates,	1
was	1
merely	1
a	1
patchwork	1
production	1
made	1
out	1
of	1
former	1
translations.	1
On	1
the	1
latest,	1
Mr.	1
A.	1
J.	1
Duffield’s,	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
in	1
every	1
sense	1
of	1
the	1
word	1
impertinent	1
in	1
me	1
to	1
offer	1
an	1
opinion	1
here.	1
I	1
had	1
not	1
even	1
seen	1
it	1
when	1
the	1
present	1
undertaking	1
was	1
proposed	1
to	1
me,	1
and	1
since	1
then	1
I	1
may	1
say	1
vidi	1
tantum,	1
having	1
for	1
obvious	1
reasons	1
resisted	1
the	1
temptation	1
which	1
Mr.	1
Duffield’s	1
reputation	1
and	1
comely	1
volumes	1
hold	1
out	1
to	1
every	1
lover	1
of	1
Cervantes.	1
From	1
the	1
foregoing	1
history	1
of	1
our	1
translations	1
of	1
“Don	1
Quixote,”	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
seen	1
that	1
there	1
are	1
a	1
good	1
many	1
people	1
who,	1
provided	1
they	1
get	1
the	1
mere	1
narrative	1
with	1
its	1
full	1
complement	1
of	1
facts,	1
incidents,	1
and	1
adventures	1
served	1
up	1
to	1
them	1
in	1
a	1
form	1
that	1
amuses	1
them,	1
care	1
very	1
little	1
whether	1
that	1
form	1
is	1
the	1
one	1
in	1
which	1
Cervantes	1
originally	1
shaped	1
his	1
ideas.	1
On	1
the	1
other	1
hand,	1
it	1
is	1
clear	1
that	1
there	1
are	1
many	1
who	1
desire	1
to	1
have	1
not	1
merely	1
the	1
story	1
he	1
tells,	1
but	1
the	1
story	1
as	1
he	1
tells	1
it,	1
so	1
far	1
at	1
least	1
as	1
differences	1
of	1
idiom	1
and	1
circumstances	1
permit,	1
and	1
who	1
will	1
give	1
a	1
preference	1
to	1
the	1
conscientious	1
translator,	1
even	1
though	1
he	1
may	1
have	1
acquitted	1
himself	1
somewhat	1
awkwardly.	1
But	1
after	1
all	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
real	1
antagonism	1
between	1
the	1
two	1
classes;	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
reason	1
why	1
what	1
pleases	1
the	1
one	1
should	1
not	1
please	1
the	1
other,	1
or	1
why	1
a	1
translator	1
who	1
makes	1
it	1
his	1
aim	1
to	1
treat	1
“Don	1
Quixote”	1
with	1
the	1
respect	1
due	1
to	1
a	1
great	1
classic,	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
as	1
acceptable	1
even	1
to	1
the	1
careless	1
reader	1
as	1
the	1
one	1
who	1
treats	1
it	1
as	1
a	1
famous	1
old	1
jest-book.	1
It	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
question	1
of	1
caviare	1
to	1
the	1
general,	1
or,	1
if	1
it	1
is,	1
the	1
fault	1
rests	1
with	1
him	1
who	1
makes	1
so.	1
The	1
method	1
by	1
which	1
Cervantes	1
won	1
the	1
ear	1
of	1
the	1
Spanish	1
people	1
ought,	1
mutatis	1
mutandis,	1
to	1
be	1
equally	1
effective	1
with	1
the	1
great	1
majority	1
of	1
English	1
readers.	1
At	1
any	1
rate,	1
even	1
if	1
there	1
are	1
readers	1
to	1
whom	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
matter	1
of	1
indifference,	1
fidelity	1
to	1
the	1
method	1
is	1
as	1
much	1
a	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
translator’s	1
duty	1
as	1
fidelity	1
to	1
the	1
matter.	1
If	1
he	1
can	1
please	1
all	1
parties,	1
so	1
much	1
the	1
better;	1
but	1
his	1
first	1
duty	1
is	1
to	1
those	1
who	1
look	1
to	1
him	1
for	1
as	1
faithful	1
a	1
representation	1
of	1
his	1
author	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
in	1
his	1
power	1
to	1
give	1
them,	1
faithful	1
to	1
the	1
letter	1
so	1
long	1
as	1
fidelity	1
is	1
practicable,	1
faithful	1
to	1
the	1
spirit	1
so	1
far	1
as	1
he	1
can	1
make	1
it.	1
My	1
purpose	1
here	1
is	1
not	1
to	1
dogmatise	1
on	1
the	1
rules	1
of	1
translation,	1
but	1
to	1
indicate	1
those	1
I	1
have	1
followed,	1
or	1
at	1
least	1
tried	1
to	1
the	1
best	1
of	1
my	1
ability	1
to	1
follow,	1
in	1
the	1
present	1
instance.	1
One	1
which,	1
it	1
seems	1
to	1
me,	1
cannot	1
be	1
too	1
rigidly	1
followed	1
in	1
translating	1
“Don	1
Quixote,”	1
is	1
to	1
avoid	1
everything	1
that	1
savours	1
of	1
affectation.	1
The	1
book	1
itself	1
is,	1
indeed,	1
in	1
one	1
sense	1
a	1
protest	1
against	1
it,	1
and	1
no	1
man	1
abhorred	1
it	1
more	1
than	1
Cervantes.	1
For	1
this	1
reason,	1
I	1
think,	1
any	1
temptation	1
to	1
use	1
antiquated	1
or	1
obsolete	1
language	1
should	1
be	1
resisted.	1
It	1
is	1
after	1
all	1
an	1
affectation,	1
and	1
one	1
for	1
which	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
warrant	1
or	1
excuse.	1
Spanish	1
has	1
probably	1
undergone	1
less	1
change	1
since	1
the	1
seventeenth	1
century	1
than	1
any	1
language	1
in	1
Europe,	1
and	1
by	1
far	1
the	1
greater	1
and	1
certainly	1
the	1
best	1
part	1
of	1
“Don	1
Quixote”	1
differs	1
but	1
little	1
in	1
language	1
from	1
the	1
colloquial	1
Spanish	1
of	1
the	1
present	1
day.	1
Except	1
in	1
the	1
tales	1
and	1
Don	1
Quixote’s	1
speeches,	1
the	1
translator	1
who	1
uses	1
the	1
simplest	1
and	1
plainest	1
everyday	1
language	1
will	1
almost	1
always	1
be	1
the	1
one	1
who	1
approaches	1
nearest	1
to	1
the	1
original.	1
Seeing	1
that	1
the	1
story	1
of	1
“Don	1
Quixote”	1
and	1
all	1
its	1
characters	1
and	1
incidents	1
have	1
now	1
been	1
for	1
more	1
than	1
two	1
centuries	1
and	1
a	1
half	1
familiar	1
as	1
household	1
words	1
in	1
English	1
mouths,	1
it	1
seems	1
to	1
me	1
that	1
the	1
old	1
familiar	1
names	1
and	1
phrases	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
changed	1
without	1
good	1
reason.	1
Of	1
course	1
a	1
translator	1
who	1
holds	1
that	1
“Don	1
Quixote”	1
should	1
receive	1
the	1
treatment	1
a	1
great	1
classic	1
deserves,	1
will	1
feel	1
himself	1
bound	1
by	1
the	1
injunction	1
laid	1
upon	1
the	1
Morisco	1
in	1
Chap.	1
IX	1
not	1
to	1
omit	1
or	1
add	1
anything.	1
CERVANTES	1
Four	1
generations	1
had	1
laughed	1
over	1
“Don	1
Quixote”	1
before	1
it	1
occurred	1
to	1
anyone	1
to	1
ask,	1
who	1
and	1
what	1
manner	1
of	1
man	1
was	1
this	1
Miguel	1
de	1
Cervantes	1
Saavedra	1
whose	1
name	1
is	1
on	1
the	1
title-page;	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
too	1
late	1
for	1
a	1
satisfactory	1
answer	1
to	1
the	1
question	1
when	1
it	1
was	1
proposed	1
to	1
add	1
a	1
life	1
of	1
the	1
author	1
to	1
the	1
London	1
edition	1
published	1
at	1
Lord	1
Carteret’s	1
instance	1
in	1
1738.	1
All	1
traces	1
of	1
the	1
personality	1
of	1
Cervantes	1
had	1
by	1
that	1
time	1
disappeared.	1
Any	1
floating	1
traditions	1
that	1
may	1
once	1
have	1
existed,	1
transmitted	1
from	1
men	1
who	1
had	1
known	1
him,	1
had	1
long	1
since	1
died	1
out,	1
and	1
of	1
other	1
record	1
there	1
was	1
none;	1
for	1
the	1
sixteenth	1
and	1
seventeenth	1
centuries	1
were	1
incurious	1
as	1
to	1
“the	1
men	1
of	1
the	1
time,”	1
a	1
reproach	1
against	1
which	1
the	1
nineteenth	1
has,	1
at	1
any	1
rate,	1
secured	1
itself,	1
if	1
it	1
has	1
produced	1
no	1
Shakespeare	1
or	1
Cervantes.	1
All	1
that	1
Mayans	1
y	1
Siscar,	1
to	1
whom	1
the	1
task	1
was	1
entrusted,	1
or	1
any	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
followed	1
him,	1
Rios,	1
Pellicer,	1
or	1
Navarrete,	1
could	1
do	1
was	1
to	1
eke	1
out	1
the	1
few	1
allusions	1
Cervantes	1
makes	1
to	1
himself	1
in	1
his	1
various	1
prefaces	1
with	1
such	1
pieces	1
of	1
documentary	1
evidence	1
bearing	1
upon	1
his	1
life	1
as	1
they	1
could	1
find.	1
This,	1
however,	1
has	1
been	1
done	1
by	1
the	1
last-named	1
biographer	1
to	1
such	1
good	1
purpose	1
that	1
he	1
has	1
superseded	1
all	1
predecessors.	1
Thoroughness	1
is	1
the	1
chief	1
characteristic	1
of	1
Navarrete’s	1
work.	1
Besides	1
sifting,	1
testing,	1
and	1
methodising	1
with	1
rare	1
patience	1
and	1
judgment	1
what	1
had	1
been	1
previously	1
brought	1
to	1
light,	1
he	1
left,	1
as	1
the	1
saying	1
is,	1
no	1
stone	1
unturned	1
under	1
which	1
anything	1
to	1
illustrate	1
his	1
subject	1
might	1
possibly	1
be	1
found.	1
Navarrete	1
has	1
done	1
all	1
that	1
industry	1
and	1
acumen	1
could	1
do,	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
no	1
fault	1
of	1
his	1
if	1
he	1
has	1
not	1
given	1
us	1
what	1
we	1
want.	1
What	1
Hallam	1
says	1
of	1
Shakespeare	1
may	1
be	1
applied	1
to	1
the	1
almost	1
parallel	1
case	1
of	1
Cervantes:	1
“It	1
is	1
not	1
the	1
register	1
of	1
his	1
baptism,	1
or	1
the	1
draft	1
of	1
his	1
will,	1
or	1
the	1
orthography	1
of	1
his	1
name	1
that	1
we	1
seek;	1
no	1
letter	1
of	1
his	1
writing,	1
no	1
record	1
of	1
his	1
conversation,	1
no	1
character	1
of	1
him	1
drawn	1
...	1
by	1
a	1
contemporary	1
has	1
been	1
produced.”	1
It	1
is	1
only	1
natural,	1
therefore,	1
that	1
the	1
biographers	1
of	1
Cervantes,	1
forced	1
to	1
make	1
brick	1
without	1
straw,	1
should	1
have	1
recourse	1
largely	1
to	1
conjecture,	1
and	1
that	1
conjecture	1
should	1
in	1
some	1
instances	1
come	1
by	1
degrees	1
to	1
take	1
the	1
place	1
of	1
established	1
fact.	1
All	1
that	1
I	1
propose	1
to	1
do	1
here	1
is	1
to	1
separate	1
what	1
is	1
matter	1
of	1
fact	1
from	1
what	1
is	1
matter	1
of	1
conjecture,	1
and	1
leave	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
reader’s	1
judgment	1
to	1
decide	1
whether	1
the	1
data	1
justify	1
the	1
inference	1
or	1
not.	1
The	1
men	1
whose	1
names	1
by	1
common	1
consent	1
stand	1
in	1
the	1
front	1
rank	1
of	1
Spanish	1
literature,	1
Cervantes,	1
Lope	1
de	1
Vega,	1
Quevedo,	1
Calderon,	1
Garcilaso	1
de	1
la	1
Vega,	1
the	1
Mendozas,	1
Gongora,	1
were	1
all	1
men	1
of	1
ancient	1
families,	1
and,	1
curiously,	1
all,	1
except	1
the	1
last,	1
of	1
families	1
that	1
traced	1
their	1
origin	1
to	1
the	1
same	1
mountain	1
district	1
in	1
the	1
North	1
of	1
Spain.	1
The	1
family	1
of	1
Cervantes	1
is	1
commonly	1
said	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
of	1
Galician	1
origin,	1
and	1
unquestionably	1
it	1
was	1
in	1
possession	1
of	1
lands	1
in	1
Galicia	1
at	1
a	1
very	1
early	1
date;	1
but	1
I	1
think	1
the	1
balance	1
of	1
the	1
evidence	1
tends	1
to	1
show	1
that	1
the	1
“solar,”	1
the	1
original	1
site	1
of	1
the	1
family,	1
was	1
at	1
Cervatos	1
in	1
the	1
north-west	1
corner	1
of	1
Old	1
Castile,	1
close	1
to	1
the	1
junction	1
of	1
Castile,	1
Leon,	1
and	1
the	1
Asturias.	1
As	1
it	1
happens,	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
complete	1
history	1
of	1
the	1
Cervantes	1
family	1
from	1
the	1
tenth	1
century	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
seventeenth	1
extant	1
under	1
the	1
title	1
of	1
“Illustrious	1
Ancestry,	1
Glorious	1
Deeds,	1
and	1
Noble	1
Posterity	1
of	1
the	1
Famous	1
Nuno	1
Alfonso,	1
Alcaide	1
of	1
Toledo,”	1
written	1
in	1
1648	1
by	1
the	1
industrious	1
genealogist	1
Rodrigo	1
Mendez	1
Silva,	1
who	1
availed	1
himself	1
of	1
a	1
manuscript	1
genealogy	1
by	1
Juan	1
de	1
Mena,	1
the	1
poet	1
laureate	1
and	1
historiographer	1
of	1
John	1
II.	1
The	1
origin	1
of	1
the	1
name	1
Cervantes	1
is	1
curious.	1
Nuno	1
Alfonso	1
was	1
almost	1
as	1
distinguished	1
in	1
the	1
struggle	1
against	1
the	1
Moors	1
in	1
the	1
reign	1
of	1
Alfonso	1
VII	1
as	1
the	1
Cid	1
had	1
been	1
half	1
a	1
century	1
before	1
in	1
that	1
of	1
Alfonso	1
VI,	1
and	1
was	1
rewarded	1
by	1
divers	1
grants	1
of	1
land	1
in	1
the	1
neighbourhood	1
of	1
Toledo.	1
On	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
acquisitions,	1
about	1
two	1
leagues	1
from	1
the	1
city,	1
he	1
built	1
himself	1
a	1
castle	1
which	1
he	1
called	1
Cervatos,	1
because	1
“he	1
was	1
lord	1
of	1
the	1
solar	1
of	1
Cervatos	1
in	1
the	1
Montana,”	1
as	1
the	1
mountain	1
region	1
extending	1
from	1
the	1
Basque	1
Provinces	1
to	1
Leon	1
was	1
always	1
called.	1
At	1
his	1
death	1
in	1
battle	1
in	1
1143,	1
the	1
castle	1
passed	1
by	1
his	1
will	1
to	1
his	1
son	1
Alfonso	1
Munio,	1
who,	1
as	1
territorial	1
or	1
local	1
surnames	1
were	1
then	1
coming	1
into	1
vogue	1
in	1
place	1
of	1
the	1
simple	1
patronymic,	1
took	1
the	1
additional	1
name	1
of	1
Cervatos.	1
His	1
eldest	1
son	1
Pedro	1
succeeded	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
possession	1
of	1
the	1
castle,	1
and	1
followed	1
his	1
example	1
in	1
adopting	1
the	1
name,	1
an	1
assumption	1
at	1
which	1
the	1
younger	1
son,	1
Gonzalo,	1
seems	1
to	1
have	1
taken	1
umbrage.	1
Everyone	1
who	1
has	1
paid	1
even	1
a	1
flying	1
visit	1
to	1
Toledo	1
will	1
remember	1
the	1
ruined	1
castle	1
that	1
crowns	1
the	1
hill	1
above	1
the	1
spot	1
where	1
the	1
bridge	1
of	1
Alcántara	1
spans	1
the	1
gorge	1
of	1
the	1
Tagus,	1
and	1
with	1
its	1
broken	1
outline	1
and	1
crumbling	1
walls	1
makes	1
such	1
an	1
admirable	1
pendant	1
to	1
the	1
square	1
solid	1
Alcazar	1
towering	1
over	1
the	1
city	1
roofs	1
on	1
the	1
opposite	1
side.	1
It	1
was	1
built,	1
or	1
as	1
some	1
say	1
restored,	1
by	1
Alfonso	1
VI	1
shortly	1
after	1
his	1
occupation	1
of	1
Toledo	1
in	1
1085,	1
and	1
called	1
by	1
him	1
San	1
Servando	1
after	1
a	1
Spanish	1
martyr,	1
a	1
name	1
subsequently	1
modified	1
into	1
San	1
Servan	1
(in	1
which	1
form	1
it	1
appears	1
in	1
the	1
“Poem	1
of	1
the	1
Cid”),	1
San	1
Servantes,	1
and	1
San	1
Cervantes:	1
with	1
regard	1
to	1
which	1
last	1
the	1
“Handbook	1
for	1
Spain”	1
warns	1
its	1
readers	1
against	1
the	1
supposition	1
that	1
it	1
has	1
anything	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
the	1
author	1
of	1
“Don	1
Quixote.”	1
Ford,	1
as	1
all	1
know	1
who	1
have	1
taken	1
him	1
for	1
a	1
companion	1
and	1
counsellor	1
on	1
the	1
roads	1
of	1
Spain,	1
is	1
seldom	1
wrong	1
in	1
matters	1
of	1
literature	1
or	1
history.	1
In	1
this	1
instance,	1
however,	1
he	1
is	1
in	1
error.	1
It	1
has	1
everything	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
the	1
author	1
of	1
“Don	1
Quixote,”	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
in	1
fact	1
these	1
old	1
walls	1
that	1
have	1
given	1
to	1
Spain	1
the	1
name	1
she	1
is	1
proudest	1
of	1
to-day.	1
Gonzalo,	1
above	1
mentioned,	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
readily	1
conceived,	1
did	1
not	1
relish	1
the	1
appropriation	1
by	1
his	1
brother	1
of	1
a	1
name	1
to	1
which	1
he	1
himself	1
had	1
an	1
equal	1
right,	1
for	1
though	1
nominally	1
taken	1
from	1
the	1
castle,	1
it	1
was	1
in	1
reality	1
derived	1
from	1
the	1
ancient	1
territorial	1
possession	1
of	1
the	1
family,	1
and	1
as	1
a	1
set-off,	1
and	1
to	1
distinguish	1
himself	1
(diferenciarse)	1
from	1
his	1
brother,	1
he	1
took	1
as	1
a	1
surname	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
castle	1
on	1
the	1
bank	1
of	1
the	1
Tagus,	1
in	1
the	1
building	1
of	1
which,	1
according	1
to	1
a	1
family	1
tradition,	1
his	1
great-grandfather	1
had	1
a	1
share.	1
Both	1
brothers	1
founded	1
families.	1
The	1
Cervantes	1
branch	1
had	1
more	1
tenacity;	1
it	1
sent	1
offshoots	1
in	1
various	1
directions,	1
Andalusia,	1
Estremadura,	1
Galicia,	1
and	1
Portugal,	1
and	1
produced	1
a	1
goodly	1
line	1
of	1
men	1
distinguished	1
in	1
the	1
service	1
of	1
Church	1
and	1
State.	1
Gonzalo	1
himself,	1
and	1
apparently	1
a	1
son	1
of	1
his,	1
followed	1
Ferdinand	1
III	1
in	1
the	1
great	1
campaign	1
of	1
1236-48	1
that	1
gave	1
Cordova	1
and	1
Seville	1
to	1
Christian	1
Spain	1
and	1
penned	1
up	1
the	1
Moors	1
in	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
Granada,	1
and	1
his	1
descendants	1
intermarried	1
with	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
noblest	1
families	1
of	1
the	1
Peninsula	1
and	1
numbered	1
among	1
them	1
soldiers,	1
magistrates,	1
and	1
Church	1
dignitaries,	1
including	1
at	1
least	1
two	1
cardinal-archbishops.	1
Of	1
the	1
line	1
that	1
settled	1
in	1
Andalusia,	1
Deigo	1
de	1
Cervantes,	1
Commander	1
of	1
the	1
Order	1
of	1
Santiago,	1
married	1
Juana	1
Avellaneda,	1
daughter	1
of	1
Juan	1
Arias	1
de	1
Saavedra,	1
and	1
had	1
several	1
sons,	1
of	1
whom	1
one	1
was	1
Gonzalo	1
Gomez,	1
Corregidor	1
of	1
Jerez	1
and	1
ancestor	1
of	1
the	1
Mexican	1
and	1
Columbian	1
branches	1
of	1
the	1
family;	1
and	1
another,	1
Juan,	1
whose	1
son	1
Rodrigo	1
married	1
Doña	1
Leonor	1
de	1
Cortinas,	1
and	1
by	1
her	1
had	1
four	1
children,	1
Rodrigo,	1
Andrea,	1
Luisa,	1
and	1
Miguel,	1
our	1
author.	1
The	1
pedigree	1
of	1
Cervantes	1
is	1
not	1
without	1
its	1
bearing	1
on	1
“Don	1
Quixote.”	1
A	1
man	1
who	1
could	1
look	1
back	1
upon	1
an	1
ancestry	1
of	1
genuine	1
knights-errant	1
extending	1
from	1
well-nigh	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
Pelayo	1
to	1
the	1
siege	1
of	1
Granada	1
was	1
likely	1
to	1
have	1
a	1
strong	1
feeling	1
on	1
the	1
subject	1
of	1
the	1
sham	1
chivalry	1
of	1
the	1
romances.	1
It	1
gives	1
a	1
point,	1
too,	1
to	1
what	1
he	1
says	1
in	1
more	1
than	1
one	1
place	1
about	1
families	1
that	1
have	1
once	1
been	1
great	1
and	1
have	1
tapered	1
away	1
until	1
they	1
have	1
come	1
to	1
nothing,	1
like	1
a	1
pyramid.	1
It	1
was	1
the	1
case	1
of	1
his	1
own.	1
He	1
was	1
born	1
at	1
Alcalá	1
de	1
Henares	1
and	1
baptised	1
in	1
the	1
church	1
of	1
Santa	1
Maria	1
Mayor	1
on	1
the	1
9th	1
of	1
October,	1
1547.	1
Of	1
his	1
boyhood	1
and	1
youth	1
we	1
know	1
nothing,	1
unless	1
it	1
be	1
from	1
the	1
glimpse	1
he	1
gives	1
us	1
in	1
the	1
preface	1
to	1
his	1
“Comedies”	1
of	1
himself	1
as	1
a	1
boy	1
looking	1
on	1
with	1
delight	1
while	1
Lope	1
de	1
Rueda	1
and	1
his	1
company	1
set	1
up	1
their	1
rude	1
plank	1
stage	1
in	1
the	1
plaza	1
and	1
acted	1
the	1
rustic	1
farces	1
which	1
he	1
himself	1
afterwards	1
took	1
as	1
the	1
model	1
of	1
his	1
interludes.	1
This	1
first	1
glimpse,	1
however,	1
is	1
a	1
significant	1
one,	1
for	1
it	1
shows	1
the	1
early	1
development	1
of	1
that	1
love	1
of	1
the	1
drama	1
which	1
exercised	1
such	1
an	1
influence	1
on	1
his	1
life	1
and	1
seems	1
to	1
have	1
grown	1
stronger	1
as	1
he	1
grew	1
older,	1
and	1
of	1
which	1
this	1
very	1
preface,	1
written	1
only	1
a	1
few	1
months	1
before	1
his	1
death,	1
is	1
such	1
a	1
striking	1
proof.	1
He	1
gives	1
us	1
to	1
understand,	1
too,	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
great	1
reader	1
in	1
his	1
youth;	1
but	1
of	1
this	1
no	1
assurance	1
was	1
needed,	1
for	1
the	1
First	1
Part	1
of	1
“Don	1
Quixote”	1
alone	1
proves	1
a	1
vast	1
amount	1
of	1
miscellaneous	1
reading,	1
romances	1
of	1
chivalry,	1
ballads,	1
popular	1
poetry,	1
chronicles,	1
for	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
no	1
time	1
or	1
opportunity	1
except	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
twenty	1
years	1
of	1
his	1
life;	1
and	1
his	1
misquotations	1
and	1
mistakes	1
in	1
matters	1
of	1
detail	1
are	1
always,	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
noticed,	1
those	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
recalling	1
the	1
reading	1
of	1
his	1
boyhood.	1
Other	1
things	1
besides	1
the	1
drama	1
were	1
in	1
their	1
infancy	1
when	1
Cervantes	1
was	1
a	1
boy.	1
The	1
period	1
of	1
his	1
boyhood	1
was	1
in	1
every	1
way	1
a	1
transition	1
period	1
for	1
Spain.	1
The	1
old	1
chivalrous	1
Spain	1
had	1
passed	1
away.	1
The	1
new	1
Spain	1
was	1
the	1
mightiest	1
power	1
the	1
world	1
had	1
seen	1
since	1
the	1
Roman	1
Empire	1
and	1
it	1
had	1
not	1
yet	1
been	1
called	1
upon	1
to	1
pay	1
the	1
price	1
of	1
its	1
greatness.	1
By	1
the	1
policy	1
of	1
Ferdinand	1
and	1
Ximenez	1
the	1
sovereign	1
had	1
been	1
made	1
absolute,	1
and	1
the	1
Church	1
and	1
Inquisition	1
adroitly	1
adjusted	1
to	1
keep	1
him	1
so.	1
The	1
nobles,	1
who	1
had	1
always	1
resisted	1
absolutism	1
as	1
strenuously	1
as	1
they	1
had	1
fought	1
the	1
Moors,	1
had	1
been	1
divested	1
of	1
all	1
political	1
power,	1
a	1
like	1
fate	1
had	1
befallen	1
the	1
cities,	1
the	1
free	1
constitutions	1
of	1
Castile	1
and	1
Aragon	1
had	1
been	1
swept	1
away,	1
and	1
the	1
only	1
function	1
that	1
remained	1
to	1
the	1
Cortés	1
was	1
that	1
of	1
granting	1
money	1
at	1
the	1
King’s	1
dictation.	1
The	1
transition	1
extended	1
to	1
literature.	1
Men	1
who,	1
like	1
Garcilaso	1
de	1
la	1
Vega	1
and	1
Diego	1
Hurtado	1
de	1
Mendoza,	1
followed	1
the	1
Italian	1
wars,	1
had	1
brought	1
back	1
from	1
Italy	1
the	1
products	1
of	1
the	1
post-Renaissance	1
literature,	1
which	1
took	1
root	1
and	1
flourished	1
and	1
even	1
threatened	1
to	1
extinguish	1
the	1
native	1
growths.	1
Damon	1
and	1
Thyrsis,	1
Phyllis	1
and	1
Chloe	1
had	1
been	1
fairly	1
naturalised	1
in	1
Spain,	1
together	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
devices	1
of	1
pastoral	1
poetry	1
for	1
investing	1
with	1
an	1
air	1
of	1
novelty	1
the	1
idea	1
of	1
a	1
dispairing	1
shepherd	1
and	1
inflexible	1
shepherdess.	1
As	1
a	1
set-off	1
against	1
this,	1
the	1
old	1
historical	1
and	1
traditional	1
ballads,	1
and	1
the	1
true	1
pastorals,	1
the	1
songs	1
and	1
ballads	1
of	1
peasant	1
life,	1
were	1
being	1
collected	1
assiduously	1
and	1
printed	1
in	1
the	1
cancioneros	1
that	1
succeeded	1
one	1
another	1
with	1
increasing	1
rapidity.	1
But	1
the	1
most	1
notable	1
consequence,	1
perhaps,	1
of	1
the	1
spread	1
of	1
printing	1
was	1
the	1
flood	1
of	1
romances	1
of	1
chivalry	1
that	1
had	1
continued	1
to	1
pour	1
from	1
the	1
press	1
ever	1
since	1
Garci	1
Ordoñez	1
de	1
Montalvo	1
had	1
resuscitated	1
“Amadis	1
of	1
Gaul”	1
at	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
the	1
century.	1
For	1
a	1
youth	1
fond	1
of	1
reading,	1
solid	1
or	1
light,	1
there	1
could	1
have	1
been	1
no	1
better	1
spot	1
in	1
Spain	1
than	1
Alcalá	1
de	1
Henares	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
sixteenth	1
century.	1
It	1
was	1
then	1
a	1
busy,	1
populous	1
university	1
town,	1
something	1
more	1
than	1
the	1
enterprising	1
rival	1
of	1
Salamanca,	1
and	1
altogether	1
a	1
very	1
different	1
place	1
from	1
the	1
melancholy,	1
silent,	1
deserted	1
Alcalá	1
the	1
traveller	1
sees	1
now	1
as	1
he	1
goes	1
from	1
Madrid	1
to	1
Saragossa.	1
Theology	1
and	1
medicine	1
may	1
have	1
been	1
the	1
strong	1
points	1
of	1
the	1
university,	1
but	1
the	1
town	1
itself	1
seems	1
to	1
have	1
inclined	1
rather	1
to	1
the	1
humanities	1
and	1
light	1
literature,	1
and	1
as	1
a	1
producer	1
of	1
books	1
Alcalá	1
was	1
already	1
beginning	1
to	1
compete	1
with	1
the	1
older	1
presses	1
of	1
Toledo,	1
Burgos,	1
Salamanca	1
and	1
Seville.	1
A	1
pendant	1
to	1
the	1
picture	1
Cervantes	1
has	1
given	1
us	1
of	1
his	1
first	1
playgoings	1
might,	1
no	1
doubt,	1
have	1
been	1
often	1
seen	1
in	1
the	1
streets	1
of	1
Alcalá	1
at	1
that	1
time;	1
a	1
bright,	1
eager,	1
tawny-haired	1
boy	1
peering	1
into	1
a	1
book-shop	1
where	1
the	1
latest	1
volumes	1
lay	1
open	1
to	1
tempt	1
the	1
public,	1
wondering,	1
it	1
may	1
be,	1
what	1
that	1
little	1
book	1
with	1
the	1
woodcut	1
of	1
the	1
blind	1
beggar	1
and	1
his	1
boy,	1
that	1
called	1
itself	1
“Vida	1
de	1
Lazarillo	1
de	1
Tormes,	1
segunda	1
impresion,”	1
could	1
be	1
about;	1
or	1
with	1
eyes	1
brimming	1
over	1
with	1
merriment	1
gazing	1
at	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
preposterous	1
portraits	1
of	1
a	1
knight-errant	1
in	1
outrageous	1
panoply	1
and	1
plumes	1
with	1
which	1
the	1
publishers	1
of	1
chivalry	1
romances	1
loved	1
to	1
embellish	1
the	1
title-pages	1
of	1
their	1
folios.	1
If	1
the	1
boy	1
was	1
the	1
father	1
of	1
the	1
man,	1
the	1
sense	1
of	1
the	1
incongruous	1
that	1
was	1
strong	1
at	1
fifty	1
was	1
lively	1
at	1
ten,	1
and	1
some	1
such	1
reflections	1
as	1
these	1
may	1
have	1
been	1
the	1
true	1
genesis	1
of	1
“Don	1
Quixote.”	1
For	1
his	1
more	1
solid	1
education,	1
we	1
are	1
told,	1
he	1
went	1
to	1
Salamanca.	1
But	1
why	1
Rodrigo	1
de	1
Cervantes,	1
who	1
was	1
very	1
poor,	1
should	1
have	1
sent	1
his	1
son	1
to	1
a	1
university	1
a	1
hundred	1
and	1
fifty	1
miles	1
away	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
one	1
at	1
his	1
own	1
door,	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
puzzle,	1
if	1
we	1
had	1
any	1
reason	1
for	1
supposing	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
so.	1
The	1
only	1
evidence	1
is	1
a	1
vague	1
statement	1
by	1
Professor	1
Tomas	1
Gonzalez,	1
that	1
he	1
once	1
saw	1
an	1
old	1
entry	1
of	1
the	1
matriculation	1
of	1
a	1
Miguel	1
de	1
Cervantes.	1
This	1
does	1
not	1
appear	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
ever	1
seen	1
again;	1
but	1
even	1
if	1
it	1
had,	1
and	1
if	1
the	1
date	1
corresponded,	1
it	1
would	1
prove	1
nothing,	1
as	1
there	1
were	1
at	1
least	1
two	1
other	1
Miguels	1
born	1
about	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
century;	1
one	1
of	1
them,	1
moreover,	1
a	1
Cervantes	1
Saavedra,	1
a	1
cousin,	1
no	1
doubt,	1
who	1
was	1
a	1
source	1
of	1
great	1
embarrassment	1
to	1
the	1
biographers.	1
That	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
student	1
neither	1
at	1
Salamanca	1
nor	1
at	1
Alcalá	1
is	1
best	1
proved	1
by	1
his	1
own	1
works.	1
No	1
man	1
drew	1
more	1
largely	1
upon	1
experience	1
than	1
he	1
did,	1
and	1
he	1
has	1
nowhere	1
left	1
a	1
single	1
reminiscence	1
of	1
student	1
life—for	1
the	1
“Tia	1
Fingida,”	1
if	1
it	1
be	1
his,	1
is	1
not	1
one—nothing,	1
not	1
even	1
“a	1
college	1
joke,”	1
to	1
show	1
that	1
he	1
remembered	1
days	1
that	1
most	1
men	1
remember	1
best.	1
All	1
that	1
we	1
know	1
positively	1
about	1
his	1
education	1
is	1
that	1
Juan	1
Lopez	1
de	1
Hoyos,	1
a	1
professor	1
of	1
humanities	1
and	1
belles-lettres	1
of	1
some	1
eminence,	1
calls	1
him	1
his	1
“dear	1
and	1
beloved	1
pupil.”	1
This	1
was	1
in	1
a	1
little	1
collection	1
of	1
verses	1
by	1
different	1
hands	1
on	1
the	1
death	1
of	1
Isabel	1
de	1
Valois,	1
second	1
queen	1
of	1
Philip	1
II.,	1
published	1
by	1
the	1
professor	1
in	1
1569,	1
to	1
which	1
Cervantes	1
contributed	1
four	1
pieces,	1
including	1
an	1
elegy,	1
and	1
an	1
epitaph	1
in	1
the	1
form	1
of	1
a	1
sonnet.	1
It	1
is	1
only	1
by	1
a	1
rare	1
chance	1
that	1
a	1
“Lycidas”	1
finds	1
its	1
way	1
into	1
a	1
volume	1
of	1
this	1
sort,	1
and	1
Cervantes	1
was	1
no	1
Milton.	1
His	1
verses	1
are	1
no	1
worse	1
than	1
such	1
things	1
usually	1
are;	1
so	1
much,	1
at	1
least,	1
may	1
be	1
said	1
for	1
them.	1
By	1
the	1
time	1
the	1
book	1
appeared	1
he	1
had	1
left	1
Spain,	1
and,	1
as	1
fate	1
ordered	1
it,	1
for	1
twelve	1
years,	1
the	1
most	1
eventful	1
ones	1
of	1
his	1
life.	1
Giulio,	1
afterwards	1
Cardinal,	1
Acquaviva	1
had	1
been	1
sent	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
1568	1
to	1
Philip	1
II.	1
by	1
the	1
Pope	1
on	1
a	1
mission,	1
partly	1
of	1
condolence,	1
partly	1
political,	1
and	1
on	1
his	1
return	1
to	1
Rome,	1
which	1
was	1
somewhat	1
brusquely	1
expedited	1
by	1
the	1
King,	1
he	1
took	1
Cervantes	1
with	1
him	1
as	1
his	1
camarero	1
(chamberlain),	1
the	1
office	1
he	1
himself	1
held	1
in	1
the	1
Pope’s	1
household.	1
The	1
post	1
would	1
no	1
doubt	1
have	1
led	1
to	1
advancement	1
at	1
the	1
Papal	1
Court	1
had	1
Cervantes	1
retained	1
it,	1
but	1
in	1
the	1
summer	1
of	1
1570	1
he	1
resigned	1
it	1
and	1
enlisted	1
as	1
a	1
private	1
soldier	1
in	1
Captain	1
Diego	1
Urbina’s	1
company,	1
belonging	1
to	1
Don	1
Miguel	1
de	1
Moncada’s	1
regiment,	1
but	1
at	1
that	1
time	1
forming	1
a	1
part	1
of	1
the	1
command	1
of	1
Marc	1
Antony	1
Colonna.	1
What	1
impelled	1
him	1
to	1
this	1
step	1
we	1
know	1
not,	1
whether	1
it	1
was	1
distaste	1
for	1
the	1
career	1
before	1
him,	1
or	1
purely	1
military	1
enthusiasm.	1
It	1
may	1
well	1
have	1
been	1
the	1
latter,	1
for	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
stirring	1
time;	1
the	1
events,	1
however,	1
which	1
led	1
to	1
the	1
alliance	1
between	1
Spain,	1
Venice,	1
and	1
the	1
Pope,	1
against	1
the	1
common	1
enemy,	1
the	1
Porte,	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
victory	1
of	1
the	1
combined	1
fleets	1
at	1
Lepanto,	1
belong	1
rather	1
to	1
the	1
history	1
of	1
Europe	1
than	1
to	1
the	1
life	1
of	1
Cervantes.	1
He	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
that	1
sailed	1
from	1
Messina,	1
in	1
September	1
1571,	1
under	1
the	1
command	1
of	1
Don	1
John	1
of	1
Austria;	1
but	1
on	1
the	1
morning	1
of	1
the	1
7th	1
of	1
October,	1
when	1
the	1
Turkish	1
fleet	1
was	1
sighted,	1
he	1
was	1
lying	1
below	1
ill	1
with	1
fever.	1
At	1
the	1
news	1
that	1
the	1
enemy	1
was	1
in	1
sight	1
he	1
rose,	1
and,	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
the	1
remonstrances	1
of	1
his	1
comrades	1
and	1
superiors,	1
insisted	1
on	1
taking	1
his	1
post,	1
saying	1
he	1
preferred	1
death	1
in	1
the	1
service	1
of	1
God	1
and	1
the	1
King	1
to	1
health.	1
His	1
galley,	1
the	1
_Marquesa_,	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
thick	1
of	1
the	1
fight,	1
and	1
before	1
it	1
was	1
over	1
he	1
had	1
received	1
three	1
gunshot	1
wounds,	1
two	1
in	1
the	1
breast	1
and	1
one	1
in	1
the	1
left	1
hand	1
or	1
arm.	1
On	1
the	1
morning	1
after	1
the	1
battle,	1
according	1
to	1
Navarrete,	1
he	1
had	1
an	1
interview	1
with	1
the	1
commander-in-chief,	1
Don	1
John,	1
who	1
was	1
making	1
a	1
personal	1
inspection	1
of	1
the	1
wounded,	1
one	1
result	1
of	1
which	1
was	1
an	1
addition	1
of	1
three	1
crowns	1
to	1
his	1
pay,	1
and	1
another,	1
apparently,	1
the	1
friendship	1
of	1
his	1
general.	1
How	1
severely	1
Cervantes	1
was	1
wounded	1
may	1
be	1
inferred	1
from	1
the	1
fact,	1
that	1
with	1
youth,	1
a	1
vigorous	1
frame,	1
and	1
as	1
cheerful	1
and	1
buoyant	1
a	1
temperament	1
as	1
ever	1
invalid	1
had,	1
he	1
was	1
seven	1
months	1
in	1
hospital	1
at	1
Messina	1
before	1
he	1
was	1
discharged.	1
He	1
came	1
out	1
with	1
his	1
left	1
hand	1
permanently	1
disabled;	1
he	1
had	1
lost	1
the	1
use	1
of	1
it,	1
as	1
Mercury	1
told	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
“Viaje	1
del	1
Parnaso”	1
for	1
the	1
greater	1
glory	1
of	1
the	1
right.	1
This,	1
however,	1
did	1
not	1
absolutely	1
unfit	1
him	1
for	1
service,	1
and	1
in	1
April	1
1572	1
he	1
joined	1
Manuel	1
Ponce	1
de	1
Leon’s	1
company	1
of	1
Lope	1
de	1
Figueroa’s	1
regiment,	1
in	1
which,	1
it	1
seems	1
probable,	1
his	1
brother	1
Rodrigo	1
was	1
serving,	1
and	1
shared	1
in	1
the	1
operations	1
of	1
the	1
next	1
three	1
years,	1
including	1
the	1
capture	1
of	1
the	1
Goletta	1
and	1
Tunis.	1
Taking	1
advantage	1
of	1
the	1
lull	1
which	1
followed	1
the	1
recapture	1
of	1
these	1
places	1
by	1
the	1
Turks,	1
he	1
obtained	1
leave	1
to	1
return	1
to	1
Spain,	1
and	1
sailed	1
from	1
Naples	1
in	1
September	1
1575	1
on	1
board	1
the	1
_Sun_	1
galley,	1
in	1
company	1
with	1
his	1
brother	1
Rodrigo,	1
Pedro	1
Carrillo	1
de	1
Quesada,	1
late	1
Governor	1
of	1
the	1
Goletta,	1
and	1
some	1
others,	1
and	1
furnished	1
with	1
letters	1
from	1
Don	1
John	1
of	1
Austria	1
and	1
the	1
Duke	1
of	1
Sesa,	1
the	1
Viceroy	1
of	1
Sicily,	1
recommending	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
King	1
for	1
the	1
command	1
of	1
a	1
company,	1
on	1
account	1
of	1
his	1
services;	1
a	1
_dono	1
infelice_	1
as	1
events	1
proved.	1
On	1
the	1
26th	1
they	1
fell	1
in	1
with	1
a	1
squadron	1
of	1
Algerine	1
galleys,	1
and	1
after	1
a	1
stout	1
resistance	1
were	1
overpowered	1
and	1
carried	1
into	1
Algiers.	1
By	1
means	1
of	1
a	1
ransomed	1
fellow-captive	1
the	1
brothers	1
contrived	1
to	1
inform	1
their	1
family	1
of	1
their	1
condition,	1
and	1
the	1
poor	1
people	1
at	1
Alcalá	1
at	1
once	1
strove	1
to	1
raise	1
the	1
ransom	1
money,	1
the	1
father	1
disposing	1
of	1
all	1
he	1
possessed,	1
and	1
the	1
two	1
sisters	1
giving	1
up	1
their	1
marriage	1
portions.	1
But	1
Dali	1
Mami	1
had	1
found	1
on	1
Cervantes	1
the	1
letters	1
addressed	1
to	1
the	1
King	1
by	1
Don	1
John	1
and	1
the	1
Duke	1
of	1
Sesa,	1
and,	1
concluding	1
that	1
his	1
prize	1
must	1
be	1
a	1
person	1
of	1
great	1
consequence,	1
when	1
the	1
money	1
came	1
he	1
refused	1
it	1
scornfully	1
as	1
being	1
altogether	1
insufficient.	1
The	1
owner	1
of	1
Rodrigo,	1
however,	1
was	1
more	1
easily	1
satisfied;	1
ransom	1
was	1
accepted	1
in	1
his	1
case,	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
arranged	1
between	1
the	1
brothers	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
return	1
to	1
Spain	1
and	1
procure	1
a	1
vessel	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
to	1
come	1
back	1
to	1
Algiers	1
and	1
take	1
off	1
Miguel	1
and	1
as	1
many	1
of	1
their	1
comrades	1
as	1
possible.	1
This	1
was	1
not	1
the	1
first	1
attempt	1
to	1
escape	1
that	1
Cervantes	1
had	1
made.	1
Soon	1
after	1
the	1
commencement	1
of	1
his	1
captivity	1
he	1
induced	1
several	1
of	1
his	1
companions	1
to	1
join	1
him	1
in	1
trying	1
to	1
reach	1
Oran,	1
then	1
a	1
Spanish	1
post,	1
on	1
foot;	1
but	1
after	1
the	1
first	1
day’s	1
journey,	1
the	1
Moor	1
who	1
had	1
agreed	1
to	1
act	1
as	1
their	1
guide	1
deserted	1
them,	1
and	1
they	1
had	1
no	1
choice	1
but	1
to	1
return.	1
The	1
second	1
attempt	1
was	1
more	1
disastrous.	1
In	1
a	1
garden	1
outside	1
the	1
city	1
on	1
the	1
sea-shore,	1
he	1
constructed,	1
with	1
the	1
help	1
of	1
the	1
gardener,	1
a	1
Spaniard,	1
a	1
hiding-place,	1
to	1
which	1
he	1
brought,	1
one	1
by	1
one,	1
fourteen	1
of	1
his	1
fellow-captives,	1
keeping	1
them	1
there	1
in	1
secrecy	1
for	1
several	1
months,	1
and	1
supplying	1
them	1
with	1
food	1
through	1
a	1
renegade	1
known	1
as	1
El	1
Dorador,	1
“the	1
Gilder.”	1
How	1
he,	1
a	1
captive	1
himself,	1
contrived	1
to	1
do	1
all	1
this,	1
is	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
mysteries	1
of	1
the	1
story.	1
Wild	1
as	1
the	1
project	1
may	1
appear,	1
it	1
was	1
very	1
nearly	1
successful.	1
The	1
vessel	1
procured	1
by	1
Rodrigo	1
made	1
its	1
appearance	1
off	1
the	1
coast,	1
and	1
under	1
cover	1
of	1
night	1
was	1
proceeding	1
to	1
take	1
off	1
the	1
refugees,	1
when	1
the	1
crew	1
were	1
alarmed	1
by	1
a	1
passing	1
fishing	1
boat,	1
and	1
beat	1
a	1
hasty	1
retreat.	1
On	1
renewing	1
the	1
attempt	1
shortly	1
afterwards,	1
they,	1
or	1
a	1
portion	1
of	1
them	1
at	1
least,	1
were	1
taken	1
prisoners,	1
and	1
just	1
as	1
the	1
poor	1
fellows	1
in	1
the	1
garden	1
were	1
exulting	1
in	1
the	1
thought	1
that	1
in	1
a	1
few	1
moments	1
more	1
freedom	1
would	1
be	1
within	1
their	1
grasp,	1
they	1
found	1
themselves	1
surrounded	1
by	1
Turkish	1
troops,	1
horse	1
and	1
foot.	1
The	1
Dorador	1
had	1
revealed	1
the	1
whole	1
scheme	1
to	1
the	1
Dey	1
Hassan.	1
When	1
Cervantes	1
saw	1
what	1
had	1
befallen	1
them,	1
he	1
charged	1
his	1
companions	1
to	1
lay	1
all	1
the	1
blame	1
upon	1
him,	1
and	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
being	1
bound	1
he	1
declared	1
aloud	1
that	1
the	1
whole	1
plot	1
was	1
of	1
his	1
contriving,	1
and	1
that	1
nobody	1
else	1
had	1
any	1
share	1
in	1
it.	1
Brought	1
before	1
the	1
Dey,	1
he	1
said	1
the	1
same.	1
He	1
was	1
threatened	1
with	1
impalement	1
and	1
with	1
torture;	1
and	1
as	1
cutting	1
off	1
ears	1
and	1
noses	1
were	1
playful	1
freaks	1
with	1
the	1
Algerines,	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
conceived	1
what	1
their	1
tortures	1
were	1
like;	1
but	1
nothing	1
could	1
make	1
him	1
swerve	1
from	1
his	1
original	1
statement	1
that	1
he	1
and	1
he	1
alone	1
was	1
responsible.	1
The	1
upshot	1
was	1
that	1
the	1
unhappy	1
gardener	1
was	1
hanged	1
by	1
his	1
master,	1
and	1
the	1
prisoners	1
taken	1
possession	1
of	1
by	1
the	1
Dey,	1
who,	1
however,	1
afterwards	1
restored	1
most	1
of	1
them	1
to	1
their	1
masters,	1
but	1
kept	1
Cervantes,	1
paying	1
Dali	1
Mami	1
500	1
crowns	1
for	1
him.	1
He	1
felt,	1
no	1
doubt,	1
that	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
such	1
resource,	1
energy,	1
and	1
daring,	1
was	1
too	1
dangerous	1
a	1
piece	1
of	1
property	1
to	1
be	1
left	1
in	1
private	1
hands;	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
him	1
heavily	1
ironed	1
and	1
lodged	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
prison.	1
If	1
he	1
thought	1
that	1
by	1
these	1
means	1
he	1
could	1
break	1
the	1
spirit	1
or	1
shake	1
the	1
resolution	1
of	1
his	1
prisoner,	1
he	1
was	1
soon	1
undeceived,	1
for	1
Cervantes	1
contrived	1
before	1
long	1
to	1
despatch	1
a	1
letter	1
to	1
the	1
Governor	1
of	1
Oran,	1
entreating	1
him	1
to	1
send	1
him	1
someone	1
that	1
could	1
be	1
trusted,	1
to	1
enable	1
him	1
and	1
three	1
other	1
gentlemen,	1
fellow-captives	1
of	1
his,	1
to	1
make	1
their	1
escape;	1
intending	1
evidently	1
to	1
renew	1
his	1
first	1
attempt	1
with	1
a	1
more	1
trustworthy	1
guide.	1
Unfortunately	1
the	1
Moor	1
who	1
carried	1
the	1
letter	1
was	1
stopped	1
just	1
outside	1
Oran,	1
and	1
the	1
letter	1
being	1
found	1
upon	1
him,	1
he	1
was	1
sent	1
back	1
to	1
Algiers,	1
where	1
by	1
the	1
order	1
of	1
the	1
Dey	1
he	1
was	1
promptly	1
impaled	1
as	1
a	1
warning	1
to	1
others,	1
while	1
Cervantes	1
was	1
condemned	1
to	1
receive	1
two	1
thousand	1
blows	1
of	1
the	1
stick,	1
a	1
number	1
which	1
most	1
likely	1
would	1
have	1
deprived	1
the	1
world	1
of	1
“Don	1
Quixote,”	1
had	1
not	1
some	1
persons,	1
who	1
they	1
were	1
we	1
know	1
not,	1
interceded	1
on	1
his	1
behalf.	1
After	1
this	1
he	1
seems	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
kept	1
in	1
still	1
closer	1
confinement	1
than	1
before,	1
for	1
nearly	1
two	1
years	1
passed	1
before	1
he	1
made	1
another	1
attempt.	1
This	1
time	1
his	1
plan	1
was	1
to	1
purchase,	1
by	1
the	1
aid	1
of	1
a	1
Spanish	1
renegade	1
and	1
two	1
Valencian	1
merchants	1
resident	1
in	1
Algiers,	1
an	1
armed	1
vessel	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
and	1
about	1
sixty	1
of	1
the	1
leading	1
captives	1
were	1
to	1
make	1
their	1
escape;	1
but	1
just	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
about	1
to	1
put	1
it	1
into	1
execution	1
one	1
Doctor	1
Juan	1
Blanco	1
de	1
Paz,	1
an	1
ecclesiastic	1
and	1
a	1
compatriot,	1
informed	1
the	1
Dey	1
of	1
the	1
plot.	1
Cervantes	1
by	1
force	1
of	1
character,	1
by	1
his	1
self-devotion,	1
by	1
his	1
untiring	1
energy	1
and	1
his	1
exertions	1
to	1
lighten	1
the	1
lot	1
of	1
his	1
companions	1
in	1
misery,	1
had	1
endeared	1
himself	1
to	1
all,	1
and	1
become	1
the	1
leading	1
spirit	1
in	1
the	1
captive	1
colony,	1
and,	1
incredible	1
as	1
it	1
may	1
seem,	1
jealousy	1
of	1
his	1
influence	1
and	1
the	1
esteem	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
held,	1
moved	1
this	1
man	1
to	1
compass	1
his	1
destruction	1
by	1
a	1
cruel	1
death.	1
The	1
merchants	1
finding	1
that	1
the	1
Dey	1
knew	1
all,	1
and	1
fearing	1
that	1
Cervantes	1
under	1
torture	1
might	1
make	1
disclosures	1
that	1
would	1
imperil	1
their	1
own	1
lives,	1
tried	1
to	1
persuade	1
him	1
to	1
slip	1
away	1
on	1
board	1
a	1
vessel	1
that	1
was	1
on	1
the	1
point	1
of	1
sailing	1
for	1
Spain;	1
but	1
he	1
told	1
them	1
they	1
had	1
nothing	1
to	1
fear,	1
for	1
no	1
tortures	1
would	1
make	1
him	1
compromise	1
anybody,	1
and	1
he	1
went	1
at	1
once	1
and	1
gave	1
himself	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
Dey.	1
As	1
before,	1
the	1
Dey	1
tried	1
to	1
force	1
him	1
to	1
name	1
his	1
accomplices.	1
Everything	1
was	1
made	1
ready	1
for	1
his	1
immediate	1
execution;	1
the	1
halter	1
was	1
put	1
round	1
his	1
neck	1
and	1
his	1
hands	1
tied	1
behind	1
him,	1
but	1
all	1
that	1
could	1
be	1
got	1
from	1
him	1
was	1
that	1
he	1
himself,	1
with	1
the	1
help	1
of	1
four	1
gentlemen	1
who	1
had	1
since	1
left	1
Algiers,	1
had	1
arranged	1
the	1
whole,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
sixty	1
who	1
were	1
to	1
accompany	1
him	1
were	1
not	1
to	1
know	1
anything	1
of	1
it	1
until	1
the	1
last	1
moment.	1
Finding	1
he	1
could	1
make	1
nothing	1
of	1
him,	1
the	1
Dey	1
sent	1
him	1
back	1
to	1
prison	1
more	1
heavily	1
ironed	1
than	1
before.	1
The	1
poverty-stricken	1
Cervantes	1
family	1
had	1
been	1
all	1
this	1
time	1
trying	1
once	1
more	1
to	1
raise	1
the	1
ransom	1
money,	1
and	1
at	1
last	1
a	1
sum	1
of	1
three	1
hundred	1
ducats	1
was	1
got	1
together	1
and	1
entrusted	1
to	1
the	1
Redemptorist	1
Father	1
Juan	1
Gil,	1
who	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
sail	1
for	1
Algiers.	1
The	1
Dey,	1
however,	1
demanded	1
more	1
than	1
double	1
the	1
sum	1
offered,	1
and	1
as	1
his	1
term	1
of	1
office	1
had	1
expired	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
sail	1
for	1
Constantinople,	1
taking	1
all	1
his	1
slaves	1
with	1
him,	1
the	1
case	1
of	1
Cervantes	1
was	1
critical.	1
He	1
was	1
already	1
on	1
board	1
heavily	1
ironed,	1
when	1
the	1
Dey	1
at	1
length	1
agreed	1
to	1
reduce	1
his	1
demand	1
by	1
one-half,	1
and	1
Father	1
Gil	1
by	1
borrowing	1
was	1
able	1
to	1
make	1
up	1
the	1
amount,	1
and	1
on	1
September	1
19,	1
1580,	1
after	1
a	1
captivity	1
of	1
five	1
years	1
all	1
but	1
a	1
week,	1
Cervantes	1
was	1
at	1
last	1
set	1
free.	1
Before	1
long	1
he	1
discovered	1
that	1
Blanco	1
de	1
Paz,	1
who	1
claimed	1
to	1
be	1
an	1
officer	1
of	1
the	1
Inquisition,	1
was	1
now	1
concocting	1
on	1
false	1
evidence	1
a	1
charge	1
of	1
misconduct	1
to	1
be	1
brought	1
against	1
him	1
on	1
his	1
return	1
to	1
Spain.	1
To	1
checkmate	1
him	1
Cervantes	1
drew	1
up	1
a	1
series	1
of	1
twenty-five	1
questions,	1
covering	1
the	1
whole	1
period	1
of	1
his	1
captivity,	1
upon	1
which	1
he	1
requested	1
Father	1
Gil	1
to	1
take	1
the	1
depositions	1
of	1
credible	1
witnesses	1
before	1
a	1
notary.	1
Eleven	1
witnesses	1
taken	1
from	1
among	1
the	1
principal	1
captives	1
in	1
Algiers	1
deposed	1
to	1
all	1
the	1
facts	1
above	1
stated	1
and	1
to	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
more	1
besides.	1
There	1
is	1
something	1
touching	1
in	1
the	1
admiration,	1
love,	1
and	1
gratitude	1
we	1
see	1
struggling	1
to	1
find	1
expression	1
in	1
the	1
formal	1
language	1
of	1
the	1
notary,	1
as	1
they	1
testify	1
one	1
after	1
another	1
to	1
the	1
good	1
deeds	1
of	1
Cervantes,	1
how	1
he	1
comforted	1
and	1
helped	1
the	1
weak-hearted,	1
how	1
he	1
kept	1
up	1
their	1
drooping	1
courage,	1
how	1
he	1
shared	1
his	1
poor	1
purse	1
with	1
this	1
deponent,	1
and	1
how	1
“in	1
him	1
this	1
deponent	1
found	1
father	1
and	1
mother.”	1
On	1
his	1
return	1
to	1
Spain	1
he	1
found	1
his	1
old	1
regiment	1
about	1
to	1
march	1
for	1
Portugal	1
to	1
support	1
Philip’s	1
claim	1
to	1
the	1
crown,	1
and	1
utterly	1
penniless	1
now,	1
had	1
no	1
choice	1
but	1
to	1
rejoin	1
it.	1
He	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
expeditions	1
to	1
the	1
Azores	1
in	1
1582	1
and	1
the	1
following	1
year,	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
conclusion	1
of	1
the	1
war	1
returned	1
to	1
Spain	1
in	1
the	1
autumn	1
of	1
1583,	1
bringing	1
with	1
him	1
the	1
manuscript	1
of	1
his	1
pastoral	1
romance,	1
the	1
“Galatea,”	1
and	1
probably	1
also,	1
to	1
judge	1
by	1
internal	1
evidence,	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
portion	1
of	1
“Persiles	1
and	1
Sigismunda.”	1
He	1
also	1
brought	1
back	1
with	1
him,	1
his	1
biographers	1
assert,	1
an	1
infant	1
daughter,	1
the	1
offspring	1
of	1
an	1
amour,	1
as	1
some	1
of	1
them	1
with	1
great	1
circumstantiality	1
inform	1
us,	1
with	1
a	1
Lisbon	1
lady	1
of	1
noble	1
birth,	1
whose	1
name,	1
however,	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
street	1
she	1
lived	1
in,	1
they	1
omit	1
to	1
mention.	1
The	1
sole	1
foundation	1
for	1
all	1
this	1
is	1
that	1
in	1
1605	1
there	1
certainly	1
was	1
living	1
in	1
the	1
family	1
of	1
Cervantes	1
a	1
Doña	1
Isabel	1
de	1
Saavedra,	1
who	1
is	1
described	1
in	1
an	1
official	1
document	1
as	1
his	1
natural	1
daughter,	1
and	1
then	1
twenty	1
years	1
of	1
age.	1
With	1
his	1
crippled	1
left	1
hand	1
promotion	1
in	1
the	1
army	1
was	1
hopeless,	1
now	1
that	1
Don	1
John	1
was	1
dead	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
no	1
one	1
to	1
press	1
his	1
claims	1
and	1
services,	1
and	1
for	1
a	1
man	1
drawing	1
on	1
to	1
forty	1
life	1
in	1
the	1
ranks	1
was	1
a	1
dismal	1
prospect;	1
he	1
had	1
already	1
a	1
certain	1
reputation	1
as	1
a	1
poet;	1
he	1
made	1
up	1
his	1
mind,	1
therefore,	1
to	1
cast	1
his	1
lot	1
with	1
literature,	1
and	1
for	1
a	1
first	1
venture	1
committed	1
his	1
“Galatea”	1
to	1
the	1
press.	1
It	1
was	1
published,	1
as	1
Salva	1
y	1
Mallen	1
shows	1
conclusively,	1
at	1
Alcalá,	1
his	1
own	1
birth-place,	1
in	1
1585	1
and	1
no	1
doubt	1
helped	1
to	1
make	1
his	1
name	1
more	1
widely	1
known,	1
but	1
certainly	1
did	1
not	1
do	1
him	1
much	1
good	1
in	1
any	1
other	1
way.	1
While	1
it	1
was	1
going	1
through	1
the	1
press,	1
he	1
married	1
Doña	1
Catalina	1
de	1
Palacios	1
Salazar	1
y	1
Vozmediano,	1
a	1
lady	1
of	1
Esquivias	1
near	1
Madrid,	1
and	1
apparently	1
a	1
friend	1
of	1
the	1
family,	1
who	1
brought	1
him	1
a	1
fortune	1
which	1
may	1
possibly	1
have	1
served	1
to	1
keep	1
the	1
wolf	1
from	1
the	1
door,	1
but	1
if	1
so,	1
that	1
was	1
all.	1
The	1
drama	1
had	1
by	1
this	1
time	1
outgrown	1
market-place	1
stages	1
and	1
strolling	1
companies,	1
and	1
with	1
his	1
old	1
love	1
for	1
it	1
he	1
naturally	1
turned	1
to	1
it	1
for	1
a	1
congenial	1
employment.	1
In	1
about	1
three	1
years	1
he	1
wrote	1
twenty	1
or	1
thirty	1
plays,	1
which	1
he	1
tells	1
us	1
were	1
performed	1
without	1
any	1
throwing	1
of	1
cucumbers	1
or	1
other	1
missiles,	1
and	1
ran	1
their	1
course	1
without	1
any	1
hisses,	1
outcries,	1
or	1
disturbance.	1
In	1
other	1
words,	1
his	1
plays	1
were	1
not	1
bad	1
enough	1
to	1
be	1
hissed	1
off	1
the	1
stage,	1
but	1
not	1
good	1
enough	1
to	1
hold	1
their	1
own	1
upon	1
it.	1
Only	1
two	1
of	1
them	1
have	1
been	1
preserved,	1
but	1
as	1
they	1
happen	1
to	1
be	1
two	1
of	1
the	1
seven	1
or	1
eight	1
he	1
mentions	1
with	1
complacency,	1
we	1
may	1
assume	1
they	1
are	1
favourable	1
specimens,	1
and	1
no	1
one	1
who	1
reads	1
the	1
“Numancia”	1
and	1
the	1
“Trato	1
de	1
Argel”	1
will	1
feel	1
any	1
surprise	1
that	1
they	1
failed	1
as	1
acting	1
dramas.	1
Whatever	1
merits	1
they	1
may	1
have,	1
whatever	1
occasional	1
they	1
may	1
show,	1
they	1
are,	1
as	1
regards	1
construction,	1
incurably	1
clumsy.	1
How	1
completely	1
they	1
failed	1
is	1
manifest	1
from	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
with	1
all	1
his	1
sanguine	1
temperament	1
and	1
indomitable	1
perseverance	1
he	1
was	1
unable	1
to	1
maintain	1
the	1
struggle	1
to	1
gain	1
a	1
livelihood	1
as	1
a	1
dramatist	1
for	1
more	1
than	1
three	1
years;	1
nor	1
was	1
the	1
rising	1
popularity	1
of	1
Lope	1
the	1
cause,	1
as	1
is	1
often	1
said,	1
notwithstanding	1
his	1
own	1
words	1
to	1
the	1
contrary.	1
When	1
Lope	1
began	1
to	1
write	1
for	1
the	1
stage	1
is	1
uncertain,	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
certainly	1
after	1
Cervantes	1
went	1
to	1
Seville.	1
Among	1
the	1
“Nuevos	1
Documentos”	1
printed	1
by	1
Señor	1
Asensio	1
y	1
Toledo	1
is	1
one	1
dated	1
1592,	1
and	1
curiously	1
characteristic	1
of	1
Cervantes.	1
It	1
is	1
an	1
agreement	1
with	1
one	1
Rodrigo	1
Osorio,	1
a	1
manager,	1
who	1
was	1
to	1
accept	1
six	1
comedies	1
at	1
fifty	1
ducats	1
(about	1
6l.)	1
apiece,	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
paid	1
in	1
any	1
case	1
unless	1
it	1
appeared	1
on	1
representation	1
that	1
the	1
said	1
comedy	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
best	1
that	1
had	1
ever	1
been	1
represented	1
in	1
Spain.	1
The	1
test	1
does	1
not	1
seem	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
ever	1
applied;	1
perhaps	1
it	1
was	1
sufficiently	1
apparent	1
to	1
Rodrigo	1
Osorio	1
that	1
the	1
comedies	1
were	1
not	1
among	1
the	1
best	1
that	1
had	1
ever	1
been	1
represented.	1
Among	1
the	1
correspondence	1
of	1
Cervantes	1
there	1
might	1
have	1
been	1
found,	1
no	1
doubt,	1
more	1
than	1
one	1
letter	1
like	1
that	1
we	1
see	1
in	1
the	1
“Rake’s	1
Progress,”	1
“Sir,	1
I	1
have	1
read	1
your	1
play,	1
and	1
it	1
will	1
not	1
doo.”	1
He	1
was	1
more	1
successful	1
in	1
a	1
literary	1
contest	1
at	1
Saragossa	1
in	1
1595	1
in	1
honour	1
of	1
the	1
canonisation	1
of	1
St.	1
Jacinto,	1
when	1
his	1
composition	1
won	1
the	1
first	1
prize,	1
three	1
silver	1
spoons.	1
The	1
year	1
before	1
this	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
appointed	1
a	1
collector	1
of	1
revenues	1
for	1
the	1
kingdom	1
of	1
Granada.	1
In	1
order	1
to	1
remit	1
the	1
money	1
he	1
had	1
collected	1
more	1
conveniently	1
to	1
the	1
treasury,	1
he	1
entrusted	1
it	1
to	1
a	1
merchant,	1
who	1
failed	1
and	1
absconded;	1
and	1
as	1
the	1
bankrupt’s	1
assets	1
were	1
insufficient	1
to	1
cover	1
the	1
whole,	1
he	1
was	1
sent	1
to	1
prison	1
at	1
Seville	1
in	1
September	1
1597.	1
The	1
balance	1
against	1
him,	1
however,	1
was	1
a	1
small	1
one,	1
about	1
26l.,	1
and	1
on	1
giving	1
security	1
for	1
it	1
he	1
was	1
released	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
year.	1
It	1
was	1
as	1
he	1
journeyed	1
from	1
town	1
to	1
town	1
collecting	1
the	1
king’s	1
taxes,	1
that	1
he	1
noted	1
down	1
those	1
bits	1
of	1
inn	1
and	1
wayside	1
life	1
and	1
character	1
that	1
abound	1
in	1
the	1
pages	1
of	1
“Don	1
Quixote:”	1
the	1
Benedictine	1
monks	1
with	1
spectacles	1
and	1
sunshades,	1
mounted	1
on	1
their	1
tall	1
mules;	1
the	1
strollers	1
in	1
costume	1
bound	1
for	1
the	1
next	1
village;	1
the	1
barber	1
with	1
his	1
basin	1
on	1
his	1
head,	1
on	1
his	1
way	1
to	1
bleed	1
a	1
patient;	1
the	1
recruit	1
with	1
his	1
breeches	1
in	1
his	1
bundle,	1
tramping	1
along	1
the	1
road	1
singing;	1
the	1
reapers	1
gathered	1
in	1
the	1
venta	1
gateway	1
listening	1
to	1
“Felixmarte	1
of	1
Hircania”	1
read	1
out	1
to	1
them;	1
and	1
those	1
little	1
Hogarthian	1
touches	1
that	1
he	1
so	1
well	1
knew	1
how	1
to	1
bring	1
in,	1
the	1
ox-tail	1
hanging	1
up	1
with	1
the	1
landlord’s	1
comb	1
stuck	1
in	1
it,	1
the	1
wine-skins	1
at	1
the	1
bed-head,	1
and	1
those	1
notable	1
examples	1
of	1
hostelry	1
art,	1
Helen	1
going	1
off	1
in	1
high	1
spirits	1
on	1
Paris’s	1
arm,	1
and	1
Dido	1
on	1
the	1
tower	1
dropping	1
tears	1
as	1
big	1
as	1
walnuts.	1
Nay,	1
it	1
may	1
well	1
be	1
that	1
on	1
those	1
journeys	1
into	1
remote	1
regions	1
he	1
came	1
across	1
now	1
and	1
then	1
a	1
specimen	1
of	1
the	1
pauper	1
gentleman,	1
with	1
his	1
lean	1
hack	1
and	1
his	1
greyhound	1
and	1
his	1
books	1
of	1
chivalry,	1
dreaming	1
away	1
his	1
life	1
in	1
happy	1
ignorance	1
that	1
the	1
world	1
had	1
changed	1
since	1
his	1
great-grandfather’s	1
old	1
helmet	1
was	1
new.	1
But	1
it	1
was	1
in	1
Seville	1
that	1
he	1
found	1
out	1
his	1
true	1
vocation,	1
though	1
he	1
himself	1
would	1
not	1
by	1
any	1
means	1
have	1
admitted	1
it	1
to	1
be	1
so.	1
It	1
was	1
there,	1
in	1
Triana,	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
first	1
tempted	1
to	1
try	1
his	1
hand	1
at	1
drawing	1
from	1
life,	1
and	1
first	1
brought	1
his	1
humour	1
into	1
play	1
in	1
the	1
exquisite	1
little	1
sketch	1
of	1
“Rinconete	1
y	1
Cortadillo,”	1
the	1
germ,	1
in	1
more	1
ways	1
than	1
one,	1
of	1
“Don	1
Quixote.”	1
Where	1
and	1
when	1
that	1
was	1
written,	1
we	1
cannot	1
tell.	1
After	1
his	1
imprisonment	1
all	1
trace	1
of	1
Cervantes	1
in	1
his	1
official	1
capacity	1
disappears,	1
from	1
which	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
inferred	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
reinstated.	1
That	1
he	1
was	1
still	1
in	1
Seville	1
in	1
November	1
1598	1
appears	1
from	1
a	1
satirical	1
sonnet	1
of	1
his	1
on	1
the	1
elaborate	1
catafalque	1
erected	1
to	1
testify	1
the	1
grief	1
of	1
the	1
city	1
at	1
the	1
death	1
of	1
Philip	1
II,	1
but	1
from	1
this	1
up	1
to	1
1603	1
we	1
have	1
no	1
clue	1
to	1
his	1
movements.	1
The	1
words	1
in	1
the	1
preface	1
to	1
the	1
First	1
Part	1
of	1
“Don	1
Quixote”	1
are	1
generally	1
held	1
to	1
be	1
conclusive	1
that	1
he	1
conceived	1
the	1
idea	1
of	1
the	1
book,	1
and	1
wrote	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
it	1
at	1
least,	1
in	1
a	1
prison,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
have	1
done	1
so	1
is	1
extremely	1
likely.	1
There	1
is	1
a	1
tradition	1
that	1
Cervantes	1
read	1
some	1
portions	1
of	1
his	1
work	1
to	1
a	1
select	1
audience	1
at	1
the	1
Duke	1
of	1
Bejar’s,	1
which	1
may	1
have	1
helped	1
to	1
make	1
the	1
book	1
known;	1
but	1
the	1
obvious	1
conclusion	1
is	1
that	1
the	1
First	1
Part	1
of	1
“Don	1
Quixote”	1
lay	1
on	1
his	1
hands	1
some	1
time	1
before	1
he	1
could	1
find	1
a	1
publisher	1
bold	1
enough	1
to	1
undertake	1
a	1
venture	1
of	1
so	1
novel	1
a	1
character;	1
and	1
so	1
little	1
faith	1
in	1
it	1
had	1
Francisco	1
Robles	1
of	1
Madrid,	1
to	1
whom	1
at	1
last	1
he	1
sold	1
it,	1
that	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
care	1
to	1
incur	1
the	1
expense	1
of	1
securing	1
the	1
copyright	1
for	1
Aragon	1
or	1
Portugal,	1
contenting	1
himself	1
with	1
that	1
for	1
Castile.	1
The	1
printing	1
was	1
finished	1
in	1
December,	1
and	1
the	1
book	1
came	1
out	1
with	1
the	1
new	1
year,	1
1605.	1
It	1
is	1
often	1
said	1
that	1
“Don	1
Quixote”	1
was	1
at	1
first	1
received	1
coldly.	1
The	1
facts	1
show	1
just	1
the	1
contrary.	1
No	1
sooner	1
was	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
the	1
public	1
than	1
preparations	1
were	1
made	1
to	1
issue	1
pirated	1
editions	1
at	1
Lisbon	1
and	1
Valencia,	1
and	1
to	1
bring	1
out	1
a	1
second	1
edition	1
with	1
the	1
additional	1
copyrights	1
for	1
Aragon	1
and	1
Portugal,	1
which	1
he	1
secured	1
in	1
February.	1
No	1
doubt	1
it	1
was	1
received	1
with	1
something	1
more	1
than	1
coldness	1
by	1
certain	1
sections	1
of	1
the	1
community.	1
Men	1
of	1
wit,	1
taste,	1
and	1
discrimination	1
among	1
the	1
aristocracy	1
gave	1
it	1
a	1
hearty	1
welcome,	1
but	1
the	1
aristocracy	1
in	1
general	1
were	1
not	1
likely	1
to	1
relish	1
a	1
book	1
that	1
turned	1
their	1
favourite	1
reading	1
into	1
ridicule	1
and	1
laughed	1
at	1
so	1
many	1
of	1
their	1
favourite	1
ideas.	1
The	1
dramatists	1
who	1
gathered	1
round	1
Lope	1
as	1
their	1
leader	1
regarded	1
Cervantes	1
as	1
their	1
common	1
enemy,	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
plain	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
equally	1
obnoxious	1
to	1
the	1
other	1
clique,	1
the	1
culto	1
poets	1
who	1
had	1
Gongora	1
for	1
their	1
chief.	1
Navarrete,	1
who	1
knew	1
nothing	1
of	1
the	1
letter	1
above	1
mentioned,	1
tries	1
hard	1
to	1
show	1
that	1
the	1
relations	1
between	1
Cervantes	1
and	1
Lope	1
were	1
of	1
a	1
very	1
friendly	1
sort,	1
as	1
indeed	1
they	1
were	1
until	1
“Don	1
Quixote”	1
was	1
written.	1
Cervantes,	1
indeed,	1
to	1
the	1
last	1
generously	1
and	1
manfully	1
declared	1
his	1
admiration	1
of	1
Lope’s	1
powers,	1
his	1
unfailing	1
invention,	1
and	1
his	1
marvellous	1
fertility;	1
but	1
in	1
the	1
preface	1
of	1
the	1
First	1
Part	1
of	1
“Don	1
Quixote”	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
verses	1
of	1
“Urganda	1
the	1
Unknown,”	1
and	1
one	1
or	1
two	1
other	1
places,	1
there	1
are,	1
if	1
we	1
read	1
between	1
the	1
lines,	1
sly	1
hits	1
at	1
Lope’s	1
vanities	1
and	1
affectations	1
that	1
argue	1
no	1
personal	1
good-will;	1
and	1
Lope	1
openly	1
sneers	1
at	1
“Don	1
Quixote”	1
and	1
Cervantes,	1
and	1
fourteen	1
years	1
after	1
his	1
death	1
gives	1
him	1
only	1
a	1
few	1
lines	1
of	1
cold	1
commonplace	1
in	1
the	1
“Laurel	1
de	1
Apolo,”	1
that	1
seem	1
all	1
the	1
colder	1
for	1
the	1
eulogies	1
of	1
a	1
host	1
of	1
nonentities	1
whose	1
names	1
are	1
found	1
nowhere	1
else.	1
In	1
1601	1
Valladolid	1
was	1
made	1
the	1
seat	1
of	1
the	1
Court,	1
and	1
at	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
1603	1
Cervantes	1
had	1
been	1
summoned	1
thither	1
in	1
connection	1
with	1
the	1
balance	1
due	1
by	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
Treasury,	1
which	1
was	1
still	1
outstanding.	1
He	1
remained	1
at	1
Valladolid,	1
apparently	1
supporting	1
himself	1
by	1
agencies	1
and	1
scrivener’s	1
work	1
of	1
some	1
sort;	1
probably	1
drafting	1
petitions	1
and	1
drawing	1
up	1
statements	1
of	1
claims	1
to	1
be	1
presented	1
to	1
the	1
Council,	1
and	1
the	1
like.	1
So,	1
at	1
least,	1
we	1
gather	1
from	1
the	1
depositions	1
taken	1
on	1
the	1
occasion	1
of	1
the	1
death	1
of	1
a	1
gentleman,	1
the	1
victim	1
of	1
a	1
street	1
brawl,	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
carried	1
into	1
the	1
house	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
lived.	1
In	1
these	1
he	1
himself	1
is	1
described	1
as	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
wrote	1
and	1
transacted	1
business,	1
and	1
it	1
appears	1
that	1
his	1
household	1
then	1
consisted	1
of	1
his	1
wife,	1
the	1
natural	1
daughter	1
Isabel	1
de	1
Saavedra	1
already	1
mentioned,	1
his	1
sister	1
Andrea,	1
now	1
a	1
widow,	1
her	1
daughter	1
Constanza,	1
a	1
mysterious	1
Magdalena	1
de	1
Sotomayor	1
calling	1
herself	1
his	1
sister,	1
for	1
whom	1
his	1
biographers	1
cannot	1
account,	1
and	1
a	1
servant-maid.	1
Meanwhile	1
“Don	1
Quixote”	1
had	1
been	1
growing	1
in	1
favour,	1
and	1
its	1
author’s	1
name	1
was	1
now	1
known	1
beyond	1
the	1
Pyrenees.	1
In	1
1607	1
an	1
edition	1
was	1
printed	1
at	1
Brussels.	1
Robles,	1
the	1
Madrid	1
publisher,	1
found	1
it	1
necessary	1
to	1
meet	1
the	1
demand	1
by	1
a	1
third	1
edition,	1
the	1
seventh	1
in	1
all,	1
in	1
1608.	1
The	1
popularity	1
of	1
the	1
book	1
in	1
Italy	1
was	1
such	1
that	1
a	1
Milan	1
bookseller	1
was	1
led	1
to	1
bring	1
out	1
an	1
edition	1
in	1
1610;	1
and	1
another	1
was	1
called	1
for	1
in	1
Brussels	1
in	1
1611.	1
It	1
might	1
naturally	1
have	1
been	1
expected	1
that,	1
with	1
such	1
proofs	1
before	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
hit	1
the	1
taste	1
of	1
the	1
public,	1
Cervantes	1
would	1
have	1
at	1
once	1
set	1
about	1
redeeming	1
his	1
rather	1
vague	1
promise	1
of	1
a	1
second	1
volume.	1
But,	1
to	1
all	1
appearance,	1
nothing	1
was	1
farther	1
from	1
his	1
thoughts.	1
He	1
had	1
still	1
by	1
him	1
one	1
or	1
two	1
short	1
tales	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
vintage	1
as	1
those	1
he	1
had	1
inserted	1
in	1
“Don	1
Quixote”	1
and	1
instead	1
of	1
continuing	1
the	1
adventures	1
of	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
he	1
set	1
to	1
work	1
to	1
write	1
more	1
of	1
these	1
“Novelas	1
Exemplares”	1
as	1
he	1
afterwards	1
called	1
them,	1
with	1
a	1
view	1
to	1
making	1
a	1
book	1
of	1
them.	1
The	1
novels	1
were	1
published	1
in	1
the	1
summer	1
of	1
1613,	1
with	1
a	1
dedication	1
to	1
the	1
Conde	1
de	1
Lemos,	1
the	1
Maecenas	1
of	1
the	1
day,	1
and	1
with	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
chatty	1
confidential	1
prefaces	1
Cervantes	1
was	1
so	1
fond	1
of.	1
In	1
this,	1
eight	1
years	1
and	1
a	1
half	1
after	1
the	1
First	1
Part	1
of	1
“Don	1
Quixote”	1
had	1
appeared,	1
we	1
get	1
the	1
first	1
hint	1
of	1
a	1
forthcoming	1
Second	1
Part.	1
“You	1
shall	1
see	1
shortly,”	1
he	1
says,	1
“the	1
further	1
exploits	1
of	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
and	1
humours	1
of	1
Sancho	1
Panza.”	1
His	1
idea	1
of	1
“shortly”	1
was	1
a	1
somewhat	1
elastic	1
one,	1
for,	1
as	1
we	1
know	1
by	1
the	1
date	1
to	1
Sancho’s	1
letter,	1
he	1
had	1
barely	1
one-half	1
of	1
the	1
book	1
completed	1
that	1
time	1
twelvemonth.	1
But	1
more	1
than	1
poems,	1
or	1
pastorals,	1
or	1
novels,	1
it	1
was	1
his	1
dramatic	1
ambition	1
that	1
engrossed	1
his	1
thoughts.	1
The	1
same	1
indomitable	1
spirit	1
that	1
kept	1
him	1
from	1
despair	1
in	1
the	1
bagnios	1
of	1
Algiers,	1
and	1
prompted	1
him	1
to	1
attempt	1
the	1
escape	1
of	1
himself	1
and	1
his	1
comrades	1
again	1
and	1
again,	1
made	1
him	1
persevere	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
failure	1
and	1
discouragement	1
in	1
his	1
efforts	1
to	1
win	1
the	1
ear	1
of	1
the	1
public	1
as	1
a	1
dramatist.	1
The	1
temperament	1
of	1
Cervantes	1
was	1
essentially	1
sanguine.	1
The	1
portrait	1
he	1
draws	1
in	1
the	1
preface	1
to	1
the	1
novels,	1
with	1
the	1
aquiline	1
features,	1
chestnut	1
hair,	1
smooth	1
untroubled	1
forehead,	1
and	1
bright	1
cheerful	1
eyes,	1
is	1
the	1
very	1
portrait	1
of	1
a	1
sanguine	1
man.	1
Nothing	1
that	1
the	1
managers	1
might	1
say	1
could	1
persuade	1
him	1
that	1
the	1
merits	1
of	1
his	1
plays	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
recognised	1
at	1
last	1
if	1
they	1
were	1
only	1
given	1
a	1
fair	1
chance.	1
The	1
old	1
soldier	1
of	1
the	1
Spanish	1
Salamis	1
was	1
bent	1
on	1
being	1
the	1
Aeschylus	1
of	1
Spain.	1
He	1
was	1
to	1
found	1
a	1
great	1
national	1
drama,	1
based	1
on	1
the	1
true	1
principles	1
of	1
art,	1
that	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
envy	1
of	1
all	1
nations;	1
he	1
was	1
to	1
drive	1
from	1
the	1
stage	1
the	1
silly,	1
childish	1
plays,	1
the	1
“mirrors	1
of	1
nonsense	1
and	1
models	1
of	1
folly”	1
that	1
were	1
in	1
vogue	1
through	1
the	1
cupidity	1
of	1
the	1
managers	1
and	1
shortsightedness	1
of	1
the	1
authors;	1
he	1
was	1
to	1
correct	1
and	1
educate	1
the	1
public	1
taste	1
until	1
it	1
was	1
ripe	1
for	1
tragedies	1
on	1
the	1
model	1
of	1
the	1
Greek	1
drama—like	1
the	1
“Numancia”	1
for	1
instance—and	1
comedies	1
that	1
would	1
not	1
only	1
amuse	1
but	1
improve	1
and	1
instruct.	1
All	1
this	1
he	1
was	1
to	1
do,	1
could	1
he	1
once	1
get	1
a	1
hearing:	1
there	1
was	1
the	1
initial	1
difficulty.	1
He	1
shows	1
plainly	1
enough,	1
too,	1
that	1
“Don	1
Quixote”	1
and	1
the	1
demolition	1
of	1
the	1
chivalry	1
romances	1
was	1
not	1
the	1
work	1
that	1
lay	1
next	1
his	1
heart.	1
He	1
was,	1
indeed,	1
as	1
he	1
says	1
himself	1
in	1
his	1
preface,	1
more	1
a	1
stepfather	1
than	1
a	1
father	1
to	1
“Don	1
Quixote.”	1
Never	1
was	1
great	1
work	1
so	1
neglected	1
by	1
its	1
author.	1
That	1
it	1
was	1
written	1
carelessly,	1
hastily,	1
and	1
by	1
fits	1
and	1
starts,	1
was	1
not	1
always	1
his	1
fault,	1
but	1
it	1
seems	1
clear	1
he	1
never	1
read	1
what	1
he	1
sent	1
to	1
the	1
press.	1
He	1
knew	1
how	1
the	1
printers	1
had	1
blundered,	1
but	1
he	1
never	1
took	1
the	1
trouble	1
to	1
correct	1
them	1
when	1
the	1
third	1
edition	1
was	1
in	1
progress,	1
as	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
really	1
cared	1
for	1
the	1
child	1
of	1
his	1
brain	1
would	1
have	1
done.	1
He	1
appears	1
to	1
have	1
regarded	1
the	1
book	1
as	1
little	1
more	1
than	1
a	1
mere	1
libro	1
de	1
entretenimiento,	1
an	1
amusing	1
book,	1
a	1
thing,	1
as	1
he	1
says	1
in	1
the	1
“Viaje,”	1
“to	1
divert	1
the	1
melancholy	1
moody	1
heart	1
at	1
any	1
time	1
or	1
season.”	1
No	1
doubt	1
he	1
had	1
an	1
affection	1
for	1
his	1
hero,	1
and	1
was	1
very	1
proud	1
of	1
Sancho	1
Panza.	1
It	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
strange	1
indeed	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
proud	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
humorous	1
creation	1
in	1
all	1
fiction.	1
He	1
was	1
proud,	1
too,	1
of	1
the	1
popularity	1
and	1
success	1
of	1
the	1
book,	1
and	1
beyond	1
measure	1
delightful	1
is	1
the	1
naivete	1
with	1
which	1
he	1
shows	1
his	1
pride	1
in	1
a	1
dozen	1
passages	1
in	1
the	1
Second	1
Part.	1
But	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
the	1
success	1
he	1
coveted.	1
In	1
all	1
probability	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
given	1
all	1
the	1
success	1
of	1
“Don	1
Quixote,”	1
nay,	1
would	1
have	1
seen	1
every	1
copy	1
of	1
“Don	1
Quixote”	1
burned	1
in	1
the	1
Plaza	1
Mayor,	1
for	1
one	1
such	1
success	1
as	1
Lope	1
de	1
Vega	1
was	1
enjoying	1
on	1
an	1
average	1
once	1
a	1
week.	1
And	1
so	1
he	1
went	1
on,	1
dawdling	1
over	1
“Don	1
Quixote,”	1
adding	1
a	1
chapter	1
now	1
and	1
again,	1
and	1
putting	1
it	1
aside	1
to	1
turn	1
to	1
“Persiles	1
and	1
Sigismunda”—which,	1
as	1
we	1
know,	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
most	1
entertaining	1
book	1
in	1
the	1
language,	1
and	1
the	1
rival	1
of	1
“Theagenes	1
and	1
Chariclea”—or	1
finishing	1
off	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
darling	1
comedies;	1
and	1
if	1
Robles	1
asked	1
when	1
“Don	1
Quixote”	1
would	1
be	1
ready,	1
the	1
answer	1
no	1
doubt	1
was:	1
En	1
breve—shortly,	1
there	1
was	1
time	1
enough	1
for	1
that.	1
At	1
sixty-eight	1
he	1
was	1
as	1
full	1
of	1
life	1
and	1
hope	1
and	1
plans	1
for	1
the	1
future	1
as	1
a	1
boy	1
of	1
eighteen.	1
Nemesis	1
was	1
coming,	1
however.	1
He	1
had	1
got	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
Chapter	1
LIX,	1
which	1
at	1
his	1
leisurely	1
pace	1
he	1
could	1
hardly	1
have	1
reached	1
before	1
October	1
or	1
November	1
1614,	1
when	1
there	1
was	1
put	1
into	1
his	1
hand	1
a	1
small	1
octave	1
lately	1
printed	1
at	1
Tarragona,	1
and	1
calling	1
itself	1
“Second	1
Volume	1
of	1
the	1
Ingenious	1
Gentleman	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
of	1
La	1
Mancha:	1
by	1
the	1
Licentiate	1
Alonso	1
Fernandez	1
de	1
Avellaneda	1
of	1
Tordesillas.”	1
The	1
last	1
half	1
of	1
Chapter	1
LIX	1
and	1
most	1
of	1
the	1
following	1
chapters	1
of	1
the	1
Second	1
Part	1
give	1
us	1
some	1
idea	1
of	1
the	1
effect	1
produced	1
upon	1
him,	1
and	1
his	1
irritation	1
was	1
not	1
likely	1
to	1
be	1
lessened	1
by	1
the	1
reflection	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
no	1
one	1
to	1
blame	1
but	1
himself.	1
Had	1
Avellaneda,	1
in	1
fact,	1
been	1
content	1
with	1
merely	1
bringing	1
out	1
a	1
continuation	1
to	1
“Don	1
Quixote,”	1
Cervantes	1
would	1
have	1
had	1
no	1
reasonable	1
grievance.	1
His	1
own	1
intentions	1
were	1
expressed	1
in	1
the	1
very	1
vaguest	1
language	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
book;	1
nay,	1
in	1
his	1
last	1
words,	1
“forse	1
altro	1
cantera	1
con	1
miglior	1
plettro,”	1
he	1
seems	1
actually	1
to	1
invite	1
someone	1
else	1
to	1
continue	1
the	1
work,	1
and	1
he	1
made	1
no	1
sign	1
until	1
eight	1
years	1
and	1
a	1
half	1
had	1
gone	1
by;	1
by	1
which	1
time	1
Avellaneda’s	1
volume	1
was	1
no	1
doubt	1
written.	1
In	1
fact	1
Cervantes	1
had	1
no	1
case,	1
or	1
a	1
very	1
bad	1
one,	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
the	1
mere	1
continuation	1
was	1
concerned.	1
But	1
Avellaneda	1
chose	1
to	1
write	1
a	1
preface	1
to	1
it,	1
full	1
of	1
such	1
coarse	1
personal	1
abuse	1
as	1
only	1
an	1
ill-conditioned	1
man	1
could	1
pour	1
out.	1
He	1
taunts	1
Cervantes	1
with	1
being	1
old,	1
with	1
having	1
lost	1
his	1
hand,	1
with	1
having	1
been	1
in	1
prison,	1
with	1
being	1
poor,	1
with	1
being	1
friendless,	1
accuses	1
him	1
of	1
envy	1
of	1
Lope’s	1
success,	1
of	1
petulance	1
and	1
querulousness,	1
and	1
so	1
on;	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
in	1
this	1
that	1
the	1
sting	1
lay.	1
Avellaneda’s	1
reason	1
for	1
this	1
personal	1
attack	1
is	1
obvious	1
enough.	1
Whoever	1
he	1
may	1
have	1
been,	1
it	1
is	1
clear	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
dramatists	1
of	1
Lope’s	1
school,	1
for	1
he	1
has	1
the	1
impudence	1
to	1
charge	1
Cervantes	1
with	1
attacking	1
him	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
Lope	1
in	1
his	1
criticism	1
on	1
the	1
drama.	1
His	1
identification	1
has	1
exercised	1
the	1
best	1
critics	1
and	1
baffled	1
all	1
the	1
ingenuity	1
and	1
research	1
that	1
has	1
been	1
brought	1
to	1
bear	1
on	1
it.	1
Navarrete	1
and	1
Ticknor	1
both	1
incline	1
to	1
the	1
belief	1
that	1
Cervantes	1
knew	1
who	1
he	1
was;	1
but	1
I	1
must	1
say	1
I	1
think	1
the	1
anger	1
he	1
shows	1
suggests	1
an	1
invisible	1
assailant;	1
it	1
is	1
like	1
the	1
irritation	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
stung	1
by	1
a	1
mosquito	1
in	1
the	1
dark.	1
Cervantes	1
from	1
certain	1
solecisms	1
of	1
language	1
pronounces	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
an	1
Aragonese,	1
and	1
Pellicer,	1
an	1
Aragonese	1
himself,	1
supports	1
this	1
view	1
and	1
believes	1
him,	1
moreover,	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
an	1
ecclesiastic,	1
a	1
Dominican	1
probably.	1
Any	1
merit	1
Avellaneda	1
has	1
is	1
reflected	1
from	1
Cervantes,	1
and	1
he	1
is	1
too	1
dull	1
to	1
reflect	1
much.	1
“Dull	1
and	1
dirty”	1
will	1
always	1
be,	1
I	1
imagine,	1
the	1
verdict	1
of	1
the	1
vast	1
majority	1
of	1
unprejudiced	1
readers.	1
He	1
is,	1
at	1
best,	1
a	1
poor	1
plagiarist;	1
all	1
he	1
can	1
do	1
is	1
to	1
follow	1
slavishly	1
the	1
lead	1
given	1
him	1
by	1
Cervantes;	1
his	1
only	1
humour	1
lies	1
in	1
making	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
take	1
inns	1
for	1
castles	1
and	1
fancy	1
himself	1
some	1
legendary	1
or	1
historical	1
personage,	1
and	1
Sancho	1
mistake	1
words,	1
invert	1
proverbs,	1
and	1
display	1
his	1
gluttony;	1
all	1
through	1
he	1
shows	1
a	1
proclivity	1
to	1
coarseness	1
and	1
dirt,	1
and	1
he	1
has	1
contrived	1
to	1
introduce	1
two	1
tales	1
filthier	1
than	1
anything	1
by	1
the	1
sixteenth	1
century	1
novellieri	1
and	1
without	1
their	1
sprightliness.	1
But	1
whatever	1
Avellaneda	1
and	1
his	1
book	1
may	1
be,	1
we	1
must	1
not	1
forget	1
the	1
debt	1
we	1
owe	1
them.	1
But	1
for	1
them,	1
there	1
can	1
be	1
no	1
doubt,	1
“Don	1
Quixote”	1
would	1
have	1
come	1
to	1
us	1
a	1
mere	1
torso	1
instead	1
of	1
a	1
complete	1
work.	1
Even	1
if	1
Cervantes	1
had	1
finished	1
the	1
volume	1
he	1
had	1
in	1
hand,	1
most	1
assuredly	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
left	1
off	1
with	1
a	1
promise	1
of	1
a	1
Third	1
Part,	1
giving	1
the	1
further	1
adventures	1
of	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
and	1
humours	1
of	1
Sancho	1
Panza	1
as	1
shepherds.	1
It	1
is	1
plain	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
at	1
one	1
time	1
an	1
intention	1
of	1
dealing	1
with	1
the	1
pastoral	1
romances	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
dealt	1
with	1
the	1
books	1
of	1
chivalry,	1
and	1
but	1
for	1
Avellaneda	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
tried	1
to	1
carry	1
it	1
out.	1
But	1
it	1
is	1
more	1
likely	1
that,	1
with	1
his	1
plans,	1
and	1
projects,	1
and	1
hopefulness,	1
the	1
volume	1
would	1
have	1
remained	1
unfinished	1
till	1
his	1
death,	1
and	1
that	1
we	1
should	1
have	1
never	1
made	1
the	1
acquaintance	1
of	1
the	1
Duke	1
and	1
Duchess,	1
or	1
gone	1
with	1
Sancho	1
to	1
Barataria.	1
From	1
the	1
moment	1
the	1
book	1
came	1
into	1
his	1
hands	1
he	1
seems	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
haunted	1
by	1
the	1
fear	1
that	1
there	1
might	1
be	1
more	1
Avellanedas	1
in	1
the	1
field,	1
and	1
putting	1
everything	1
else	1
aside,	1
he	1
set	1
himself	1
to	1
finish	1
off	1
his	1
task	1
and	1
protect	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
in	1
the	1
only	1
way	1
he	1
could,	1
by	1
killing	1
him.	1
The	1
conclusion	1
is	1
no	1
doubt	1
a	1
hasty	1
and	1
in	1
some	1
places	1
clumsy	1
piece	1
of	1
work	1
and	1
the	1
frequent	1
repetition	1
of	1
the	1
scolding	1
administered	1
to	1
Avellaneda	1
becomes	1
in	1
the	1
end	1
rather	1
wearisome;	1
but	1
it	1
is,	1
at	1
any	1
rate,	1
a	1
conclusion	1
and	1
for	1
that	1
we	1
must	1
thank	1
Avellaneda.	1
The	1
new	1
volume	1
was	1
ready	1
for	1
the	1
press	1
in	1
February,	1
but	1
was	1
not	1
printed	1
till	1
the	1
very	1
end	1
of	1
1615,	1
and	1
during	1
the	1
interval	1
Cervantes	1
put	1
together	1
the	1
comedies	1
and	1
interludes	1
he	1
had	1
written	1
within	1
the	1
last	1
few	1
years,	1
and,	1
as	1
he	1
adds	1
plaintively,	1
found	1
no	1
demand	1
for	1
among	1
the	1
managers,	1
and	1
published	1
them	1
with	1
a	1
preface,	1
worth	1
the	1
book	1
it	1
introduces	1
tenfold,	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
gives	1
an	1
account	1
of	1
the	1
early	1
Spanish	1
stage,	1
and	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
attempts	1
as	1
a	1
dramatist.	1
It	1
is	1
needless	1
to	1
say	1
they	1
were	1
put	1
forward	1
by	1
Cervantes	1
in	1
all	1
good	1
faith	1
and	1
full	1
confidence	1
in	1
their	1
merits.	1
The	1
reader,	1
however,	1
was	1
not	1
to	1
suppose	1
they	1
were	1
his	1
last	1
word	1
or	1
final	1
effort	1
in	1
the	1
drama,	1
for	1
he	1
had	1
in	1
hand	1
a	1
comedy	1
called	1
“Engano	1
a	1
los	1
ojos,”	1
about	1
which,	1
if	1
he	1
mistook	1
not,	1
there	1
would	1
be	1
no	1
question.	1
Of	1
this	1
dramatic	1
masterpiece	1
the	1
world	1
has	1
no	1
opportunity	1
of	1
judging;	1
his	1
health	1
had	1
been	1
failing	1
for	1
some	1
time,	1
and	1
he	1
died,	1
apparently	1
of	1
dropsy,	1
on	1
the	1
23rd	1
of	1
April,	1
1616,	1
the	1
day	1
on	1
which	1
England	1
lost	1
Shakespeare,	1
nominally	1
at	1
least,	1
for	1
the	1
English	1
calendar	1
had	1
not	1
yet	1
been	1
reformed.	1
He	1
died	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
lived,	1
accepting	1
his	1
lot	1
bravely	1
and	1
cheerfully.	1
Was	1
it	1
an	1
unhappy	1
life,	1
that	1
of	1
Cervantes?	1
His	1
biographers	1
all	1
tell	1
us	1
that	1
it	1
was;	1
but	1
I	1
must	1
say	1
I	1
doubt	1
it.	1
It	1
was	1
a	1
hard	1
life,	1
a	1
life	1
of	1
poverty,	1
of	1
incessant	1
struggle,	1
of	1
toil	1
ill	1
paid,	1
of	1
disappointment,	1
but	1
Cervantes	1
carried	1
within	1
himself	1
the	1
antidote	1
to	1
all	1
these	1
evils.	1
His	1
was	1
not	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
light	1
natures	1
that	1
rise	1
above	1
adversity	1
merely	1
by	1
virtue	1
of	1
their	1
own	1
buoyancy;	1
it	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
fortitude	1
of	1
a	1
high	1
spirit	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
proof	1
against	1
it.	1
It	1
is	1
impossible	1
to	1
conceive	1
Cervantes	1
giving	1
way	1
to	1
despondency	1
or	1
prostrated	1
by	1
dejection.	1
As	1
for	1
poverty,	1
it	1
was	1
with	1
him	1
a	1
thing	1
to	1
be	1
laughed	1
over,	1
and	1
the	1
only	1
sigh	1
he	1
ever	1
allows	1
to	1
escape	1
him	1
is	1
when	1
he	1
says,	1
“Happy	1
he	1
to	1
whom	1
Heaven	1
has	1
given	1
a	1
piece	1
of	1
bread	1
for	1
which	1
he	1
is	1
not	1
bound	1
to	1
give	1
thanks	1
to	1
any	1
but	1
Heaven	1
itself.”	1
Add	1
to	1
all	1
this	1
his	1
vital	1
energy	1
and	1
mental	1
activity,	1
his	1
restless	1
invention	1
and	1
his	1
sanguine	1
temperament,	1
and	1
there	1
will	1
be	1
reason	1
enough	1
to	1
doubt	1
whether	1
his	1
could	1
have	1
been	1
a	1
very	1
unhappy	1
life.	1
He	1
who	1
could	1
take	1
Cervantes’	1
distresses	1
together	1
with	1
his	1
apparatus	1
for	1
enduring	1
them	1
would	1
not	1
make	1
so	1
bad	1
a	1
bargain,	1
perhaps,	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
happiness	1
in	1
life	1
is	1
concerned.	1
Of	1
his	1
burial-place	1
nothing	1
is	1
known	1
except	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
buried,	1
in	1
accordance	1
with	1
his	1
will,	1
in	1
the	1
neighbouring	1
convent	1
of	1
Trinitarian	1
nuns,	1
of	1
which	1
it	1
is	1
supposed	1
his	1
daughter,	1
Isabel	1
de	1
Saavedra,	1
was	1
an	1
inmate,	1
and	1
that	1
a	1
few	1
years	1
afterwards	1
the	1
nuns	1
removed	1
to	1
another	1
convent,	1
carrying	1
their	1
dead	1
with	1
them.	1
But	1
whether	1
the	1
remains	1
of	1
Cervantes	1
were	1
included	1
in	1
the	1
removal	1
or	1
not	1
no	1
one	1
knows,	1
and	1
the	1
clue	1
to	1
their	1
resting-place	1
is	1
now	1
lost	1
beyond	1
all	1
hope.	1
This	1
furnishes	1
perhaps	1
the	1
least	1
defensible	1
of	1
the	1
items	1
in	1
the	1
charge	1
of	1
neglect	1
brought	1
against	1
his	1
contemporaries.	1
In	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
others	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
good	1
deal	1
of	1
exaggeration.	1
To	1
listen	1
to	1
most	1
of	1
his	1
biographers	1
one	1
would	1
suppose	1
that	1
all	1
Spain	1
was	1
in	1
league	1
not	1
only	1
against	1
the	1
man	1
but	1
against	1
his	1
memory,	1
or	1
at	1
least	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
insensible	1
to	1
his	1
merits,	1
and	1
left	1
him	1
to	1
live	1
in	1
misery	1
and	1
die	1
of	1
want.	1
To	1
talk	1
of	1
his	1
hard	1
life	1
and	1
unworthy	1
employments	1
in	1
Andalusia	1
is	1
absurd.	1
What	1
had	1
he	1
done	1
to	1
distinguish	1
him	1
from	1
thousands	1
of	1
other	1
struggling	1
men	1
earning	1
a	1
precarious	1
livelihood?	1
True,	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
gallant	1
soldier,	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
wounded	1
and	1
had	1
undergone	1
captivity	1
and	1
suffering	1
in	1
his	1
country’s	1
cause,	1
but	1
there	1
were	1
hundreds	1
of	1
others	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
case.	1
He	1
had	1
written	1
a	1
mediocre	1
specimen	1
of	1
an	1
insipid	1
class	1
of	1
romance,	1
and	1
some	1
plays	1
which	1
manifestly	1
did	1
not	1
comply	1
with	1
the	1
primary	1
condition	1
of	1
pleasing:	1
were	1
the	1
playgoers	1
to	1
patronise	1
plays	1
that	1
did	1
not	1
amuse	1
them,	1
because	1
the	1
author	1
was	1
to	1
produce	1
“Don	1
Quixote”	1
twenty	1
years	1
afterwards?	1
The	1
scramble	1
for	1
copies	1
which,	1
as	1
we	1
have	1
seen,	1
followed	1
immediately	1
on	1
the	1
appearance	1
of	1
the	1
book,	1
does	1
not	1
look	1
like	1
general	1
insensibility	1
to	1
its	1
merits.	1
No	1
doubt	1
it	1
was	1
received	1
coldly	1
by	1
some,	1
but	1
if	1
a	1
man	1
writes	1
a	1
book	1
in	1
ridicule	1
of	1
periwigs	1
he	1
must	1
make	1
his	1
account	1
with	1
being	1
coldly	1
received	1
by	1
the	1
periwig	1
wearers	1
and	1
hated	1
by	1
the	1
whole	1
tribe	1
of	1
wigmakers.	1
If	1
Cervantes	1
had	1
the	1
chivalry-romance	1
readers,	1
the	1
sentimentalists,	1
the	1
dramatists,	1
and	1
the	1
poets	1
of	1
the	1
period	1
all	1
against	1
him,	1
it	1
was	1
because	1
“Don	1
Quixote”	1
was	1
what	1
it	1
was;	1
and	1
if	1
the	1
general	1
public	1
did	1
not	1
come	1
forward	1
to	1
make	1
him	1
comfortable	1
for	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
his	1
days,	1
it	1
is	1
no	1
more	1
to	1
be	1
charged	1
with	1
neglect	1
and	1
ingratitude	1
than	1
the	1
English-speaking	1
public	1
that	1
did	1
not	1
pay	1
off	1
Scott’s	1
liabilities.	1
It	1
did	1
the	1
best	1
it	1
could;	1
it	1
read	1
his	1
book	1
and	1
liked	1
it	1
and	1
bought	1
it,	1
and	1
encouraged	1
the	1
bookseller	1
to	1
pay	1
him	1
well	1
for	1
others.	1
It	1
has	1
been	1
also	1
made	1
a	1
reproach	1
to	1
Spain	1
that	1
she	1
has	1
erected	1
no	1
monument	1
to	1
the	1
man	1
she	1
is	1
proudest	1
of;	1
no	1
monument,	1
that	1
is	1
to	1
say,	1
of	1
him;	1
for	1
the	1
bronze	1
statue	1
in	1
the	1
little	1
garden	1
of	1
the	1
Plaza	1
de	1
las	1
Cortés,	1
a	1
fair	1
work	1
of	1
art	1
no	1
doubt,	1
and	1
unexceptionable	1
had	1
it	1
been	1
set	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
local	1
poet	1
in	1
the	1
market-place	1
of	1
some	1
provincial	1
town,	1
is	1
not	1
worthy	1
of	1
Cervantes	1
or	1
of	1
Madrid.	1
But	1
what	1
need	1
has	1
Cervantes	1
of	1
“such	1
weak	1
witness	1
of	1
his	1
name;”	1
or	1
what	1
could	1
a	1
monument	1
do	1
in	1
his	1
case	1
except	1
testify	1
to	1
the	1
self-glorification	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
had	1
put	1
it	1
up?	1

The	1
nearest	1
bookseller’s	1
shop	1
will	1
show	1
what	1
bathos	1
there	1
would	1
be	1
in	1
a	1
monument	1
to	1
the	1
author	1
of	1
“Don	1
Quixote.”	1
‘DON	1
QUIXOTE’	1
Nine	1
editions	1
of	1
the	1
First	1
Part	1
of	1
“Don	1
Quixote”	1
had	1
already	1
appeared	1
before	1
Cervantes	1
died,	1
thirty	1
thousand	1
copies	1
in	1
all,	1
according	1
to	1
his	1
own	1
estimate,	1
and	1
a	1
tenth	1
was	1
printed	1
at	1
Barcelona	1
the	1
year	1
after	1
his	1
death.	1
So	1
large	1
a	1
number	1
naturally	1
supplied	1
the	1
demand	1
for	1
some	1
time,	1
but	1
by	1
1634	1
it	1
appears	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
exhausted;	1
and	1
from	1
that	1
time	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
present	1
day	1
the	1
stream	1
of	1
editions	1
has	1
continued	1
to	1
flow	1
rapidly	1
and	1
regularly.	1
The	1
translations	1
show	1
still	1
more	1
clearly	1
in	1
what	1
request	1
the	1
book	1
has	1
been	1
from	1
the	1
very	1
outset.	1
In	1
seven	1
years	1
from	1
the	1
completion	1
of	1
the	1
work	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
translated	1
into	1
the	1
four	1
leading	1
languages	1
of	1
Europe.	1
Except	1
the	1
Bible,	1
in	1
fact,	1
no	1
book	1
has	1
been	1
so	1
widely	1
diffused	1
as	1
“Don	1
Quixote.”	1
The	1
“Imitatio	1
Christi”	1
may	1
have	1
been	1
translated	1
into	1
as	1
many	1
different	1
languages,	1
and	1
perhaps	1
“Robinson	1
Crusoe”	1
and	1
the	1
“Vicar	1
of	1
Wakefield”	1
into	1
nearly	1
as	1
many,	1
but	1
in	1
multiplicity	1
of	1
translations	1
and	1
editions	1
“Don	1
Quixote”	1
leaves	1
them	1
all	1
far	1
behind.	1
Still	1
more	1
remarkable	1
is	1
the	1
character	1
of	1
this	1
wide	1
diffusion.	1
“Don	1
Quixote”	1
has	1
been	1
thoroughly	1
naturalised	1
among	1
people	1
whose	1
ideas	1
about	1
knight-errantry,	1
if	1
they	1
had	1
any	1
at	1
all,	1
were	1
of	1
the	1
vaguest,	1
who	1
had	1
never	1
seen	1
or	1
heard	1
of	1
a	1
book	1
of	1
chivalry,	1
who	1
could	1
not	1
possibly	1
feel	1
the	1
humour	1
of	1
the	1
burlesque	1
or	1
sympathise	1
with	1
the	1
author’s	1
purpose.	1
Another	1
curious	1
fact	1
is	1
that	1
this,	1
the	1
most	1
cosmopolitan	1
book	1
in	1
the	1
world,	1
is	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
intensely	1
national.	1
“Manon	1
Lescaut”	1
is	1
not	1
more	1
thoroughly	1
French,	1
“Tom	1
Jones”	1
not	1
more	1
English,	1
“Rob	1
Roy”	1
not	1
more	1
Scotch,	1
than	1
“Don	1
Quixote”	1
is	1
Spanish,	1
in	1
character,	1
in	1
ideas,	1
in	1
sentiment,	1
in	1
local	1
colour,	1
in	1
everything.	1
What,	1
then,	1
is	1
the	1
secret	1
of	1
this	1
unparalleled	1
popularity,	1
increasing	1
year	1
by	1
year	1
for	1
well-nigh	1
three	1
centuries?	1
One	1
explanation,	1
no	1
doubt,	1
is	1
that	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
books	1
in	1
the	1
world,	1
“Don	1
Quixote”	1
is	1
the	1
most	1
catholic.	1
There	1
is	1
something	1
in	1
it	1
for	1
every	1
sort	1
of	1
reader,	1
young	1
or	1
old,	1
sage	1
or	1
simple,	1
high	1
or	1
low.	1
As	1
Cervantes	1
himself	1
says	1
with	1
a	1
touch	1
of	1
pride,	1
“It	1
is	1
thumbed	1
and	1
read	1
and	1
got	1
by	1
heart	1
by	1
people	1
of	1
all	1
sorts;	1
the	1
children	1
turn	1
its	1
leaves,	1
the	1
young	1
people	1
read	1
it,	1
the	1
grown	1
men	1
understand	1
it,	1
the	1
old	1
folk	1
praise	1
it.”	1
But	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
idle	1
to	1
deny	1
that	1
the	1
ingredient	1
which,	1
more	1
than	1
its	1
humour,	1
or	1
its	1
wisdom,	1
or	1
the	1
fertility	1
of	1
invention	1
or	1
knowledge	1
of	1
human	1
nature	1
it	1
displays,	1
has	1
insured	1
its	1
success	1
with	1
the	1
multitude,	1
is	1
the	1
vein	1
of	1
farce	1
that	1
runs	1
through	1
it.	1
It	1
was	1
the	1
attack	1
upon	1
the	1
sheep,	1
the	1
battle	1
with	1
the	1
wine-skins,	1
Mambrino’s	1
helmet,	1
the	1
balsam	1
of	1
Fierabras,	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
knocked	1
over	1
by	1
the	1
sails	1
of	1
the	1
windmill,	1
Sancho	1
tossed	1
in	1
the	1
blanket,	1
the	1
mishaps	1
and	1
misadventures	1
of	1
master	1
and	1
man,	1
that	1
were	1
originally	1
the	1
great	1
attraction,	1
and	1
perhaps	1
are	1
so	1
still	1
to	1
some	1
extent	1
with	1
the	1
majority	1
of	1
readers.	1
It	1
is	1
plain	1
that	1
“Don	1
Quixote”	1
was	1
generally	1
regarded	1
at	1
first,	1
and	1
indeed	1
in	1
Spain	1
for	1
a	1
long	1
time,	1
as	1
little	1
more	1
than	1
a	1
queer	1
droll	1
book,	1
full	1
of	1
laughable	1
incidents	1
and	1
absurd	1
situations,	1
very	1
amusing,	1
but	1
not	1
entitled	1
to	1
much	1
consideration	1
or	1
care.	1
All	1
the	1
editions	1
printed	1
in	1
Spain	1
from	1
1637	1
to	1
1771,	1
when	1
the	1
famous	1
printer	1
Ibarra	1
took	1
it	1
up,	1
were	1
mere	1
trade	1
editions,	1
badly	1
and	1
carelessly	1
printed	1
on	1
vile	1
paper	1
and	1
got	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
style	1
of	1
chap-books	1
intended	1
only	1
for	1
popular	1
use,	1
with,	1
in	1
most	1
instances,	1
uncouth	1
illustrations	1
and	1
clap-trap	1
additions	1
by	1
the	1
publisher.	1
To	1
England	1
belongs	1
the	1
credit	1
of	1
having	1
been	1
the	1
first	1
country	1
to	1
recognise	1
the	1
right	1
of	1
“Don	1
Quixote”	1
to	1
better	1
treatment	1
than	1
this.	1
The	1
London	1
edition	1
of	1
1738,	1
commonly	1
called	1
Lord	1
Carteret’s	1
from	1
having	1
been	1
suggested	1
by	1
him,	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
mere	1
_édition	1
de	1
luxe_.	1
It	1
produced	1
“Don	1
Quixote”	1
in	1
becoming	1
form	1
as	1
regards	1
paper	1
and	1
type,	1
and	1
embellished	1
with	1
plates	1
which,	1
if	1
not	1
particularly	1
happy	1
as	1
illustrations,	1
were	1
at	1
least	1
well	1
intentioned	1
and	1
well	1
executed,	1
but	1
it	1
also	1
aimed	1
at	1
correctness	1
of	1
text,	1
a	1
matter	1
to	1
which	1
nobody	1
except	1
the	1
editors	1
of	1
the	1
Valencia	1
and	1
Brussels	1
editions	1
had	1
given	1
even	1
a	1
passing	1
thought;	1
and	1
for	1
a	1
first	1
attempt	1
it	1
was	1
fairly	1
successful,	1
for	1
though	1
some	1
of	1
its	1
emendations	1
are	1
inadmissible,	1
a	1
good	1
many	1
of	1
them	1
have	1
been	1
adopted	1
by	1
all	1
subsequent	1
editors.	1
The	1
zeal	1
of	1
publishers,	1
editors,	1
and	1
annotators	1
brought	1
about	1
a	1
remarkable	1
change	1
of	1
sentiment	1
with	1
regard	1
to	1
“Don	1
Quixote.”	1
A	1
vast	1
number	1
of	1
its	1
admirers	1
began	1
to	1
grow	1
ashamed	1
of	1
laughing	1
over	1
it.	1
It	1
became	1
almost	1
a	1
crime	1
to	1
treat	1
it	1
as	1
a	1
humorous	1
book.	1
The	1
humour	1
was	1
not	1
entirely	1
denied,	1
but,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
new	1
view,	1
it	1
was	1
rated	1
as	1
an	1
altogether	1
secondary	1
quality,	1
a	1
mere	1
accessory,	1
nothing	1
more	1
than	1
the	1
stalking-horse	1
under	1
the	1
presentation	1
of	1
which	1
Cervantes	1
shot	1
his	1
philosophy	1
or	1
his	1
satire,	1
or	1
whatever	1
it	1
was	1
he	1
meant	1
to	1
shoot;	1
for	1
on	1
this	1
point	1
opinions	1
varied.	1
All	1
were	1
agreed,	1
however,	1
that	1
the	1
object	1
he	1
aimed	1
at	1
was	1
not	1
the	1
books	1
of	1
chivalry.	1
He	1
said	1
emphatically	1
in	1
the	1
preface	1
to	1
the	1
First	1
Part	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
last	1
sentence	1
of	1
the	1
Second,	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
no	1
other	1
object	1
in	1
view	1
than	1
to	1
discredit	1
these	1
books,	1
and	1
this,	1
to	1
advanced	1
criticism,	1
made	1
it	1
clear	1
that	1
his	1
object	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
something	1
else.	1
One	1
theory	1
was	1
that	1
the	1
book	1
was	1
a	1
kind	1
of	1
allegory,	1
setting	1
forth	1
the	1
eternal	1
struggle	1
between	1
the	1
ideal	1
and	1
the	1
real,	1
between	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
poetry	1
and	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
prose;	1
and	1
perhaps	1
German	1
philosophy	1
never	1
evolved	1
a	1
more	1
ungainly	1
or	1
unlikely	1
camel	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
depths	1
of	1
its	1
inner	1
consciousness.	1
Something	1
of	1
the	1
antagonism,	1
no	1
doubt,	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
found	1
in	1
“Don	1
Quixote,”	1
because	1
it	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
found	1
everywhere	1
in	1
life,	1
and	1
Cervantes	1
drew	1
from	1
life.	1
It	1
is	1
difficult	1
to	1
imagine	1
a	1
community	1
in	1
which	1
the	1
never-ceasing	1
game	1
of	1
cross-purposes	1
between	1
Sancho	1
Panza	1
and	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
recognised	1
as	1
true	1
to	1
nature.	1
In	1
the	1
stone	1
age,	1
among	1
the	1
lake	1
dwellers,	1
among	1
the	1
cave	1
men,	1
there	1
were	1
Don	1
Quixotes	1
and	1
Sancho	1
Panzas;	1
there	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
the	1
troglodyte	1
who	1
never	1
could	1
see	1
the	1
facts	1
before	1
his	1
eyes,	1
and	1
the	1
troglodyte	1
who	1
could	1
see	1
nothing	1
else.	1
But	1
to	1
suppose	1
Cervantes	1
deliberately	1
setting	1
himself	1
to	1
expound	1
any	1
such	1
idea	1
in	1
two	1
stout	1
quarto	1
volumes	1
is	1
to	1
suppose	1
something	1
not	1
only	1
very	1
unlike	1
the	1
age	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
lived,	1
but	1
altogether	1
unlike	1
Cervantes	1
himself,	1
who	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
the	1
first	1
to	1
laugh	1
at	1
an	1
attempt	1
of	1
the	1
sort	1
made	1
by	1
anyone	1
else.	1
The	1
extraordinary	1
influence	1
of	1
the	1
romances	1
of	1
chivalry	1
in	1
his	1
day	1
is	1
quite	1
enough	1
to	1
account	1
for	1
the	1
genesis	1
of	1
the	1
book.	1
Some	1
idea	1
of	1
the	1
prodigious	1
development	1
of	1
this	1
branch	1
of	1
literature	1
in	1
the	1
sixteenth	1
century	1
may	1
be	1
obtained	1
from	1
the	1
scrutiny	1
of	1
Chapter	1
VII,	1
if	1
the	1
reader	1
bears	1
in	1
mind	1
that	1
only	1
a	1
portion	1
of	1
the	1
romances	1
belonging	1
to	1
by	1
far	1
the	1
largest	1
group	1
are	1
enumerated.	1
As	1
to	1
its	1
effect	1
upon	1
the	1
nation,	1
there	1
is	1
abundant	1
evidence.	1
From	1
the	1
time	1
when	1
the	1
Amadises	1
and	1
Palmerins	1
began	1
to	1
grow	1
popular	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
very	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
century,	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
steady	1
stream	1
of	1
invective,	1
from	1
men	1
whose	1
character	1
and	1
position	1
lend	1
weight	1
to	1
their	1
words,	1
against	1
the	1
romances	1
of	1
chivalry	1
and	1
the	1
infatuation	1
of	1
their	1
readers.	1
Ridicule	1
was	1
the	1
only	1
besom	1
to	1
sweep	1
away	1
that	1
dust.	1
That	1
this	1
was	1
the	1
task	1
Cervantes	1
set	1
himself,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
ample	1
provocation	1
to	1
urge	1
him	1
to	1
it,	1
will	1
be	1
sufficiently	1
clear	1
to	1
those	1
who	1
look	1
into	1
the	1
evidence;	1
as	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
also	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
chivalry	1
itself	1
that	1
he	1
attacked	1
and	1
swept	1
away.	1
Of	1
all	1
the	1
absurdities	1
that,	1
thanks	1
to	1
poetry,	1
will	1
be	1
repeated	1
to	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
time,	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
greater	1
one	1
than	1
saying	1
that	1
“Cervantes	1
smiled	1
Spain’s	1
chivalry	1
away.”	1
In	1
the	1
first	1
place	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
chivalry	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
smile	1
away.	1
Spain’s	1
chivalry	1
had	1
been	1
dead	1
for	1
more	1
than	1
a	1
century.	1
Its	1
work	1
was	1
done	1
when	1
Granada	1
fell,	1
and	1
as	1
chivalry	1
was	1
essentially	1
republican	1
in	1
its	1
nature,	1
it	1
could	1
not	1
live	1
under	1
the	1
rule	1
that	1
Ferdinand	1
substituted	1
for	1
the	1
free	1
institutions	1
of	1
mediaeval	1
Spain.	1
What	1
he	1
did	1
smile	1
away	1
was	1
not	1
chivalry	1
but	1
a	1
degrading	1
mockery	1
of	1
it.	1
The	1
true	1
nature	1
of	1
the	1
“right	1
arm”	1
and	1
the	1
“bright	1
array,”	1
before	1
which,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
poet,	1
“the	1
world	1
gave	1
ground,”	1
and	1
which	1
Cervantes’	1
single	1
laugh	1
demolished,	1
may	1
be	1
gathered	1
from	1
the	1
words	1
of	1
one	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
countrymen,	1
Don	1
Felix	1
Pacheco,	1
as	1
reported	1
by	1
Captain	1
George	1
Carleton,	1
in	1
his	1
“Military	1
Memoirs	1
from	1
1672	1
to	1
1713.”	1
“Before	1
the	1
appearance	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
of	1
that	1
labour	1
of	1
Cervantes,”	1
he	1
said,	1
“it	1
was	1
next	1
to	1
an	1
impossibility	1
for	1
a	1
man	1
to	1
walk	1
the	1
streets	1
with	1
any	1
delight	1
or	1
without	1
danger.	1
There	1
were	1
seen	1
so	1
many	1
cavaliers	1
prancing	1
and	1
curvetting	1
before	1
the	1
windows	1
of	1
their	1
mistresses,	1
that	1
a	1
stranger	1
would	1
have	1
imagined	1
the	1
whole	1
nation	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
nothing	1
less	1
than	1
a	1
race	1
of	1
knight-errants.	1
But	1
after	1
the	1
world	1
became	1
a	1
little	1
acquainted	1
with	1
that	1
notable	1
history,	1
the	1
man	1
that	1
was	1
seen	1
in	1
that	1
once	1
celebrated	1
drapery	1
was	1
pointed	1
at	1
as	1
a	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
and	1
found	1
himself	1
the	1
jest	1
of	1
high	1
and	1
low.	1
And	1
I	1
verily	1
believe	1
that	1
to	1
this,	1
and	1
this	1
only,	1
we	1
owe	1
that	1
dampness	1
and	1
poverty	1
of	1
spirit	1
which	1
has	1
run	1
through	1
all	1
our	1
councils	1
for	1
a	1
century	1
past,	1
so	1
little	1
agreeable	1
to	1
those	1
nobler	1
actions	1
of	1
our	1
famous	1
ancestors.”	1
To	1
call	1
“Don	1
Quixote”	1
a	1
sad	1
book,	1
preaching	1
a	1
pessimist	1
view	1
of	1
life,	1
argues	1
a	1
total	1
misconception	1
of	1
its	1
drift.	1
It	1
would	1
be	1
so	1
if	1
its	1
moral	1
were	1
that,	1
in	1
this	1
world,	1
true	1
enthusiasm	1
naturally	1
leads	1
to	1
ridicule	1
and	1
discomfiture.	1
But	1
it	1
preaches	1
nothing	1
of	1
the	1
sort;	1
its	1
moral,	1
so	1
far	1
as	1
it	1
can	1
be	1
said	1
to	1
have	1
one,	1
is	1
that	1
the	1
spurious	1
enthusiasm	1
that	1
is	1
born	1
of	1
vanity	1
and	1
self-conceit,	1
that	1
is	1
made	1
an	1
end	1
in	1
itself,	1
not	1
a	1
means	1
to	1
an	1
end,	1
that	1
acts	1
on	1
mere	1
impulse,	1
regardless	1
of	1
circumstances	1
and	1
consequences,	1
is	1
mischievous	1
to	1
its	1
owner,	1
and	1
a	1
very	1
considerable	1
nuisance	1
to	1
the	1
community	1
at	1
large.	1
To	1
those	1
who	1
cannot	1
distinguish	1
between	1
the	1
one	1
kind	1
and	1
the	1
other,	1
no	1
doubt	1
“Don	1
Quixote”	1
is	1
a	1
sad	1
book;	1
no	1
doubt	1
to	1
some	1
minds	1
it	1
is	1
very	1
sad	1
that	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
had	1
just	1
uttered	1
so	1
beautiful	1
a	1
sentiment	1
as	1
that	1
“it	1
is	1
a	1
hard	1
case	1
to	1
make	1
slaves	1
of	1
those	1
whom	1
God	1
and	1
Nature	1
made	1
free,”	1
should	1
be	1
ungratefully	1
pelted	1
by	1
the	1
scoundrels	1
his	1
crazy	1
philanthropy	1
had	1
let	1
loose	1
on	1
society;	1
but	1
to	1
others	1
of	1
a	1
more	1
judicial	1
cast	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
a	1
matter	1
of	1
regret	1
that	1
reckless	1
self-sufficient	1
enthusiasm	1
is	1
not	1
oftener	1
requited	1
in	1
some	1
such	1
way	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
mischief	1
it	1
does	1
in	1
the	1
world.	1
A	1
very	1
slight	1
examination	1
of	1
the	1
structure	1
of	1
“Don	1
Quixote”	1
will	1
suffice	1
to	1
show	1
that	1
Cervantes	1
had	1
no	1
deep	1
design	1
or	1
elaborate	1
plan	1
in	1
his	1
mind	1
when	1
he	1
began	1
the	1
book.	1
When	1
he	1
wrote	1
those	1
lines	1
in	1
which	1
“with	1
a	1
few	1
strokes	1
of	1
a	1
great	1
master	1
he	1
sets	1
before	1
us	1
the	1
pauper	1
gentleman,”	1
he	1
had	1
no	1
idea	1
of	1
the	1
goal	1
to	1
which	1
his	1
imagination	1
was	1
leading	1
him.	1
There	1
can	1
be	1
little	1
doubt	1
that	1
all	1
he	1
contemplated	1
was	1
a	1
short	1
tale	1
to	1
range	1
with	1
those	1
he	1
had	1
already	1
written,	1
a	1
tale	1
setting	1
forth	1
the	1
ludicrous	1
results	1
that	1
might	1
be	1
expected	1
to	1
follow	1
the	1
attempt	1
of	1
a	1
crazy	1
gentleman	1
to	1
act	1
the	1
part	1
of	1
a	1
knight-errant	1
in	1
modern	1
life.	1
It	1
is	1
plain,	1
for	1
one	1
thing,	1
that	1
Sancho	1
Panza	1
did	1
not	1
enter	1
into	1
the	1
original	1
scheme,	1
for	1
had	1
Cervantes	1
thought	1
of	1
him	1
he	1
certainly	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
omitted	1
him	1
in	1
his	1
hero’s	1
outfit,	1
which	1
he	1
obviously	1
meant	1
to	1
be	1
complete.	1
Him	1
we	1
owe	1
to	1
the	1
landlord’s	1
chance	1
remark	1
in	1
Chapter	1
III	1
that	1
knights	1
seldom	1
travelled	1
without	1
squires.	1
To	1
try	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
a	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
without	1
Sancho	1
Panza	1
is	1
like	1
trying	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
a	1
one-bladed	1
pair	1
of	1
scissors.	1
The	1
story	1
was	1
written	1
at	1
first,	1
like	1
the	1
others,	1
without	1
any	1
division	1
and	1
without	1
the	1
intervention	1
of	1
Cid	1
Hamete	1
Benengeli;	1
and	1
it	1
seems	1
not	1
unlikely	1
that	1
Cervantes	1
had	1
some	1
intention	1
of	1
bringing	1
Dulcinea,	1
or	1
Aldonza	1
Lorenzo,	1
on	1
the	1
scene	1
in	1
person.	1
It	1
was	1
probably	1
the	1
ransacking	1
of	1
the	1
Don’s	1
library	1
and	1
the	1
discussion	1
on	1
the	1
books	1
of	1
chivalry	1
that	1
first	1
suggested	1
it	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
his	1
idea	1
was	1
capable	1
of	1
development.	1
What,	1
if	1
instead	1
of	1
a	1
mere	1
string	1
of	1
farcical	1
misadventures,	1
he	1
were	1
to	1
make	1
his	1
tale	1
a	1
burlesque	1
of	1
one	1
of	1
these	1
books,	1
caricaturing	1
their	1
style,	1
incidents,	1
and	1
spirit?	1
In	1
pursuance	1
of	1
this	1
change	1
of	1
plan,	1
he	1
hastily	1
and	1
somewhat	1
clumsily	1
divided	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
written	1
into	1
chapters	1
on	1
the	1
model	1
of	1
“Amadis,”	1
invented	1
the	1
fable	1
of	1
a	1
mysterious	1
Arabic	1
manuscript,	1
and	1
set	1
up	1
Cid	1
Hamete	1
Benengeli	1
in	1
imitation	1
of	1
the	1
almost	1
invariable	1
practice	1
of	1
the	1
chivalry-romance	1
authors,	1
who	1
were	1
fond	1
of	1
tracing	1
their	1
books	1
to	1
some	1
recondite	1
source.	1
In	1
working	1
out	1
the	1
new	1
ideas,	1
he	1
soon	1
found	1
the	1
value	1
of	1
Sancho	1
Panza.	1
Indeed,	1
the	1
keynote,	1
not	1
only	1
to	1
Sancho’s	1
part,	1
but	1
to	1
the	1
whole	1
book,	1
is	1
struck	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
words	1
Sancho	1
utters	1
when	1
he	1
announces	1
his	1
intention	1
of	1
taking	1
his	1
ass	1
with	1
him.	1
“About	1
the	1
ass,”	1
we	1
are	1
told,	1
“Don	1
Quixote	1
hesitated	1
a	1
little,	1
trying	1
whether	1
he	1
could	1
call	1
to	1
mind	1
any	1
knight-errant	1
taking	1
with	1
him	1
an	1
esquire	1
mounted	1
on	1
ass-back;	1
but	1
no	1
instance	1
occurred	1
to	1
his	1
memory.”	1
We	1
can	1
see	1
the	1
whole	1
scene	1
at	1
a	1
glance,	1
the	1
stolid	1
unconsciousness	1
of	1
Sancho	1
and	1
the	1
perplexity	1
of	1
his	1
master,	1
upon	1
whose	1
perception	1
the	1
incongruity	1
has	1
just	1
forced	1
itself.	1
This	1
is	1
Sancho’s	1
mission	1
throughout	1
the	1
book;	1
he	1
is	1
an	1
unconscious	1
Mephistopheles,	1
always	1
unwittingly	1
making	1
mockery	1
of	1
his	1
master’s	1
aspirations,	1
always	1
exposing	1
the	1
fallacy	1
of	1
his	1
ideas	1
by	1
some	1
unintentional	1
ad	1
absurdum,	1
always	1
bringing	1
him	1
back	1
to	1
the	1
world	1
of	1
fact	1
and	1
commonplace	1
by	1
force	1
of	1
sheer	1
stolidity.	1
By	1
the	1
time	1
Cervantes	1
had	1
got	1
his	1
volume	1
of	1
novels	1
off	1
his	1
hands,	1
and	1
summoned	1
up	1
resolution	1
enough	1
to	1
set	1
about	1
the	1
Second	1
Part	1
in	1
earnest,	1
the	1
case	1
was	1
very	1
much	1
altered.	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
and	1
Sancho	1
Panza	1
had	1
not	1
merely	1
found	1
favour,	1
but	1
had	1
already	1
become,	1
what	1
they	1
have	1
never	1
since	1
ceased	1
to	1
be,	1
veritable	1
entities	1
to	1
the	1
popular	1
imagination.	1
There	1
was	1
no	1
occasion	1
for	1
him	1
now	1
to	1
interpolate	1
extraneous	1
matter;	1
nay,	1
his	1
readers	1
told	1
him	1
plainly	1
that	1
what	1
they	1
wanted	1
of	1
him	1
was	1
more	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
and	1
more	1
Sancho	1
Panza,	1
and	1
not	1
novels,	1
tales,	1
or	1
digressions.	1
To	1
himself,	1
too,	1
his	1
creations	1
had	1
become	1
realities,	1
and	1
he	1
had	1
become	1
proud	1
of	1
them,	1
especially	1
of	1
Sancho.	1
He	1
began	1
the	1
Second	1
Part,	1
therefore,	1
under	1
very	1
different	1
conditions,	1
and	1
the	1
difference	1
makes	1
itself	1
manifest	1
at	1
once.	1
Even	1
in	1
translation	1
the	1
style	1
will	1
be	1
seen	1
to	1
be	1
far	1
easier,	1
more	1
flowing,	1
more	1
natural,	1
and	1
more	1
like	1
that	1
of	1
a	1
man	1
sure	1
of	1
himself	1
and	1
of	1
his	1
audience.	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
and	1
Sancho	1
undergo	1
a	1
change	1
also.	1
In	1
the	1
First	1
Part,	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
has	1
no	1
character	1
or	1
individuality	1
whatever.	1
He	1
is	1
nothing	1
more	1
than	1
a	1
crazy	1
representative	1
of	1
the	1
sentiments	1
of	1
the	1
chivalry	1
romances.	1
In	1
all	1
that	1
he	1
says	1
and	1
does	1
he	1
is	1
simply	1
repeating	1
the	1
lesson	1
he	1
has	1
learned	1
from	1
his	1
books;	1
and	1
therefore,	1
it	1
is	1
absurd	1
to	1
speak	1
of	1
him	1
in	1
the	1
gushing	1
strain	1
of	1
the	1
sentimental	1
critics	1
when	1
they	1
dilate	1
upon	1
his	1
nobleness,	1
disinterestedness,	1
dauntless	1
courage,	1
and	1
so	1
forth.	1
It	1
was	1
the	1
business	1
of	1
a	1
knight-errant	1
to	1
right	1
wrongs,	1
redress	1
injuries,	1
and	1
succour	1
the	1
distressed,	1
and	1
this,	1
as	1
a	1
matter	1
of	1
course,	1
he	1
makes	1
his	1
business	1
when	1
he	1
takes	1
up	1
the	1
part;	1
a	1
knight-errant	1
was	1
bound	1
to	1
be	1
intrepid,	1
and	1
so	1
he	1
feels	1
bound	1
to	1
cast	1
fear	1
aside.	1
Of	1
all	1
Byron’s	1
melodious	1
nonsense	1
about	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
the	1
most	1
nonsensical	1
statement	1
is	1
that	1
“’tis	1
his	1
virtue	1
makes	1
him	1
mad!”	1
The	1
exact	1
opposite	1
is	1
the	1
truth;	1
it	1
is	1
his	1
madness	1
makes	1
him	1
virtuous.	1
In	1
the	1
Second	1
Part,	1
Cervantes	1
repeatedly	1
reminds	1
the	1
reader,	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
point	1
upon	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
anxious	1
there	1
should	1
be	1
no	1
mistake,	1
that	1
his	1
hero’s	1
madness	1
is	1
strictly	1
confined	1
to	1
delusions	1
on	1
the	1
subject	1
of	1
chivalry,	1
and	1
that	1
on	1
every	1
other	1
subject	1
he	1
is	1
discreto,	1
one,	1
in	1
fact,	1
whose	1
faculty	1
of	1
discernment	1
is	1
in	1
perfect	1
order.	1
The	1
advantage	1
of	1
this	1
is	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
enabled	1
to	1
make	1
use	1
of	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
as	1
a	1
mouthpiece	1
for	1
his	1
own	1
reflections,	1
and	1
so,	1
without	1
seeming	1
to	1
digress,	1
allow	1
himself	1
the	1
relief	1
of	1
digression	1
when	1
he	1
requires	1
it,	1
as	1
freely	1
as	1
in	1
a	1
commonplace	1
book.	1
It	1
is	1
true	1
the	1
amount	1
of	1
individuality	1
bestowed	1
upon	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
is	1
not	1
very	1
great.	1
There	1
are	1
some	1
natural	1
touches	1
of	1
character	1
about	1
him,	1
such	1
as	1
his	1
mixture	1
of	1
irascibility	1
and	1
placability,	1
and	1
his	1
curious	1
affection	1
for	1
Sancho	1
together	1
with	1
his	1
impatience	1
of	1
the	1
squire’s	1
loquacity	1
and	1
impertinence;	1
but	1
in	1
the	1
main,	1
apart	1
from	1
his	1
craze,	1
he	1
is	1
little	1
more	1
than	1
a	1
thoughtful,	1
cultured	1
gentleman,	1
with	1
instinctive	1
good	1
taste	1
and	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
of	1
shrewdness	1
and	1
originality	1
of	1
mind.	1
As	1
to	1
Sancho,	1
it	1
is	1
plain,	1
from	1
the	1
concluding	1
words	1
of	1
the	1
preface	1
to	1
the	1
First	1
Part,	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
a	1
favourite	1
with	1
his	1
creator	1
even	1
before	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
taken	1
into	1
favour	1
by	1
the	1
public.	1
An	1
inferior	1
genius,	1
taking	1
him	1
in	1
hand	1
a	1
second	1
time,	1
would	1
very	1
likely	1
have	1
tried	1
to	1
improve	1
him	1
by	1
making	1
him	1
more	1
comical,	1
clever,	1
amiable,	1
or	1
virtuous.	1
But	1
Cervantes	1
was	1
too	1
true	1
an	1
artist	1
to	1
spoil	1
his	1
work	1
in	1
this	1
way.	1
Sancho,	1
when	1
he	1
reappears,	1
is	1
the	1
old	1
Sancho	1
with	1
the	1
old	1
familiar	1
features;	1
but	1
with	1
a	1
difference;	1
they	1
have	1
been	1
brought	1
out	1
more	1
distinctly,	1
but	1
at	1
the	1
same	1
time	1
with	1
a	1
careful	1
avoidance	1
of	1
anything	1
like	1
caricature;	1
the	1
outline	1
has	1
been	1
filled	1
in	1
where	1
filling	1
in	1
was	1
necessary,	1
and,	1
vivified	1
by	1
a	1
few	1
touches	1
of	1
a	1
master’s	1
hand,	1
Sancho	1
stands	1
before	1
us	1
as	1
he	1
might	1
in	1
a	1
character	1
portrait	1
by	1
Velazquez.	1
He	1
is	1
a	1
much	1
more	1
important	1
and	1
prominent	1
figure	1
in	1
the	1
Second	1
Part	1
than	1
in	1
the	1
First;	1
indeed,	1
it	1
is	1
his	1
matchless	1
mendacity	1
about	1
Dulcinea	1
that	1
to	1
a	1
great	1
extent	1
supplies	1
the	1
action	1
of	1
the	1
story.	1
His	1
development	1
in	1
this	1
respect	1
is	1
as	1
remarkable	1
as	1
in	1
any	1
other.	1
In	1
the	1
First	1
Part	1
he	1
displays	1
a	1
great	1
natural	1
gift	1
of	1
lying.	1
His	1
lies	1
are	1
not	1
of	1
the	1
highly	1
imaginative	1
sort	1
that	1
liars	1
in	1
fiction	1
commonly	1
indulge	1
in;	1
like	1
Falstaff’s,	1
they	1
resemble	1
the	1
father	1
that	1
begets	1
them;	1
they	1
are	1
simple,	1
homely,	1
plump	1
lies;	1
plain	1
working	1
lies,	1
in	1
short.	1
But	1
in	1
the	1
service	1
of	1
such	1
a	1
master	1
as	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
he	1
develops	1
rapidly,	1
as	1
we	1
see	1
when	1
he	1
comes	1
to	1
palm	1
off	1
the	1
three	1
country	1
wenches	1
as	1
Dulcinea	1
and	1
her	1
ladies	1
in	1
waiting.	1
It	1
is	1
worth	1
noticing	1
how,	1
flushed	1
by	1
his	1
success	1
in	1
this	1
instance,	1
he	1
is	1
tempted	1
afterwards	1
to	1
try	1
a	1
flight	1
beyond	1
his	1
powers	1
in	1
his	1
account	1
of	1
the	1
journey	1
on	1
Clavileño.	1
In	1
the	1
Second	1
Part	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
spirit	1
rather	1
than	1
the	1
incidents	1
of	1
the	1
chivalry	1
romances	1
that	1
is	1
the	1
subject	1
of	1
the	1
burlesque.	1
Enchantments	1
of	1
the	1
sort	1
travestied	1
in	1
those	1
of	1
Dulcinea	1
and	1
the	1
Trifaldi	1
and	1
the	1
cave	1
of	1
Montesinos	1
play	1
a	1
leading	1
part	1
in	1
the	1
later	1
and	1
inferior	1
romances,	1
and	1
another	1
distinguishing	1
feature	1
is	1
caricatured	1
in	1
Don	1
Quixote’s	1
blind	1
adoration	1
of	1
Dulcinea.	1
In	1
the	1
romances	1
of	1
chivalry	1
love	1
is	1
either	1
a	1
mere	1
animalism	1
or	1
a	1
fantastic	1
idolatry.	1
Only	1
a	1
coarse-minded	1
man	1
would	1
care	1
to	1
make	1
merry	1
with	1
the	1
former,	1
but	1
to	1
one	1
of	1
Cervantes’	1
humour	1
the	1
latter	1
was	1
naturally	1
an	1
attractive	1
subject	1
for	1
ridicule.	1
Like	1
everything	1
else	1
in	1
these	1
romances,	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
gross	1
exaggeration	1
of	1
the	1
real	1
sentiment	1
of	1
chivalry,	1
but	1
its	1
peculiar	1
extravagance	1
is	1
probably	1
due	1
to	1
the	1
influence	1
of	1
those	1
masters	1
of	1
hyperbole,	1
the	1
Provencal	1
poets.	1
When	1
a	1
troubadour	1
professed	1
his	1
readiness	1
to	1
obey	1
his	1
lady	1
in	1
all	1
things,	1
he	1
made	1
it	1
incumbent	1
upon	1
the	1
next	1
comer,	1
if	1
he	1
wished	1
to	1
avoid	1
the	1
imputation	1
of	1
tameness	1
and	1
commonplace,	1
to	1
declare	1
himself	1
the	1
slave	1
of	1
her	1
will,	1
which	1
the	1
next	1
was	1
compelled	1
to	1
cap	1
by	1
some	1
still	1
stronger	1
declaration;	1
and	1
so	1
expressions	1
of	1
devotion	1
went	1
on	1
rising	1
one	1
above	1
the	1
other	1
like	1
biddings	1
at	1
an	1
auction,	1
and	1
a	1
conventional	1
language	1
of	1
gallantry	1
and	1
theory	1
of	1
love	1
came	1
into	1
being	1
that	1
in	1
time	1
permeated	1
the	1
literature	1
of	1
Southern	1
Europe,	1
and	1
bore	1
fruit,	1
in	1
one	1
direction	1
in	1
the	1
transcendental	1
worship	1
of	1
Beatrice	1
and	1
Laura,	1
and	1
in	1
another	1
in	1
the	1
grotesque	1
idolatry	1
which	1
found	1
exponents	1
in	1
writers	1
like	1
Feliciano	1
de	1
Silva.	1
This	1
is	1
what	1
Cervantes	1
deals	1
with	1
in	1
Don	1
Quixote’s	1
passion	1
for	1
Dulcinea,	1
and	1
in	1
no	1
instance	1
has	1
he	1
carried	1
out	1
the	1
burlesque	1
more	1
happily.	1
By	1
keeping	1
Dulcinea	1
in	1
the	1
background,	1
and	1
making	1
her	1
a	1
vague	1
shadowy	1
being	1
of	1
whose	1
very	1
existence	1
we	1
are	1
left	1
in	1
doubt,	1
he	1
invests	1
Don	1
Quixote’s	1
worship	1
of	1
her	1
virtues	1
and	1
charms	1
with	1
an	1
additional	1
extravagance,	1
and	1
gives	1
still	1
more	1
point	1
to	1
the	1
caricature	1
of	1
the	1
sentiment	1
and	1
language	1
of	1
the	1
romances.	1
One	1
of	1
the	1
great	1
merits	1
of	1
“Don	1
Quixote,”	1
and	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
qualities	1
that	1
have	1
secured	1
its	1
acceptance	1
by	1
all	1
classes	1
of	1
readers	1
and	1
made	1
it	1
the	1
most	1
cosmopolitan	1
of	1
books,	1
is	1
its	1
simplicity.	1
There	1
are,	1
of	1
course,	1
points	1
obvious	1
enough	1
to	1
a	1
Spanish	1
seventeenth	1
century	1
audience	1
which	1
do	1
not	1
immediately	1
strike	1
a	1
reader	1
now-a-days,	1
and	1
Cervantes	1
often	1
takes	1
it	1
for	1
granted	1
that	1
an	1
allusion	1
will	1
be	1
generally	1
understood	1
which	1
is	1
only	1
intelligible	1
to	1
a	1
few.	1
For	1
example,	1
on	1
many	1
of	1
his	1
readers	1
in	1
Spain,	1
and	1
most	1
of	1
his	1
readers	1
out	1
of	1
it,	1
the	1
significance	1
of	1
his	1
choice	1
of	1
a	1
country	1
for	1
his	1
hero	1
is	1
completely	1
lost.	1
It	1
would	1
be	1
going	1
too	1
far	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
no	1
one	1
can	1
thoroughly	1
comprehend	1
“Don	1
Quixote”	1
without	1
having	1
seen	1
La	1
Mancha,	1
but	1
undoubtedly	1
even	1
a	1
glimpse	1
of	1
La	1
Mancha	1
will	1
give	1
an	1
insight	1
into	1
the	1
meaning	1
of	1
Cervantes	1
such	1
as	1
no	1
commentator	1
can	1
give.	1
Of	1
all	1
the	1
regions	1
of	1
Spain	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
last	1
that	1
would	1
suggest	1
the	1
idea	1
of	1
romance.	1
Of	1
all	1
the	1
dull	1
central	1
plateau	1
of	1
the	1
Peninsula	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
dullest	1
tract.	1
There	1
is	1
something	1
impressive	1
about	1
the	1
grim	1
solitudes	1
of	1
Estremadura;	1
and	1
if	1
the	1
plains	1
of	1
Leon	1
and	1
Old	1
Castile	1
are	1
bald	1
and	1
dreary,	1
they	1
are	1
studded	1
with	1
old	1
cities	1
renowned	1
in	1
history	1
and	1
rich	1
in	1
relics	1
of	1
the	1
past.	1
But	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
redeeming	1
feature	1
in	1
the	1
Manchegan	1
landscape;	1
it	1
has	1
all	1
the	1
sameness	1
of	1
the	1
desert	1
without	1
its	1
dignity;	1
the	1
few	1
towns	1
and	1
villages	1
that	1
break	1
its	1
monotony	1
are	1
mean	1
and	1
commonplace,	1
there	1
is	1
nothing	1
venerable	1
about	1
them,	1
they	1
have	1
not	1
even	1
the	1
picturesqueness	1
of	1
poverty;	1
indeed,	1
Don	1
Quixote’s	1
own	1
village,	1
Argamasilla,	1
has	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
oppressive	1
respectability	1
in	1
the	1
prim	1
regularity	1
of	1
its	1
streets	1
and	1
houses;	1
everything	1
is	1
ignoble;	1
the	1
very	1
windmills	1
are	1
the	1
ugliest	1
and	1
shabbiest	1
of	1
the	1
windmill	1
kind.	1
To	1
anyone	1
who	1
knew	1
the	1
country	1
well,	1
the	1
mere	1
style	1
and	1
title	1
of	1
“Don	1
Quixote	1
of	1
La	1
Mancha”	1
gave	1
the	1
key	1
to	1
the	1
author’s	1
meaning	1
at	1
once.	1
La	1
Mancha	1
as	1
the	1
knight’s	1
country	1
and	1
scene	1
of	1
his	1
chivalries	1
is	1
of	1
a	1
piece	1
with	1
the	1
pasteboard	1
helmet,	1
the	1
farm-labourer	1
on	1
ass-back	1
for	1
a	1
squire,	1
knighthood	1
conferred	1
by	1
a	1
rascally	1
ventero,	1
convicts	1
taken	1
for	1
victims	1
of	1
oppression,	1
and	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
incongruities	1
between	1
Don	1
Quixote’s	1
world	1
and	1
the	1
world	1
he	1
lived	1
in,	1
between	1
things	1
as	1
he	1
saw	1
them	1
and	1
things	1
as	1
they	1
were.	1
It	1
is	1
strange	1
that	1
this	1
element	1
of	1
incongruity,	1
underlying	1
the	1
whole	1
humour	1
and	1
purpose	1
of	1
the	1
book,	1
should	1
have	1
been	1
so	1
little	1
heeded	1
by	1
the	1
majority	1
of	1
those	1
who	1
have	1
undertaken	1
to	1
interpret	1
“Don	1
Quixote.”	1
It	1
has	1
been	1
completely	1
overlooked,	1
for	1
example,	1
by	1
the	1
illustrators.	1
To	1
be	1
sure,	1
the	1
great	1
majority	1
of	1
the	1
artists	1
who	1
illustrated	1
“Don	1
Quixote”	1
knew	1
nothing	1
whatever	1
of	1
Spain.	1
To	1
them	1
a	1
venta	1
conveyed	1
no	1
idea	1
but	1
the	1
abstract	1
one	1
of	1
a	1
roadside	1
inn,	1
and	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
therefore	1
do	1
full	1
justice	1
to	1
the	1
humour	1
of	1
Don	1
Quixote’s	1
misconception	1
in	1
taking	1
it	1
for	1
a	1
castle,	1
or	1
perceive	1
the	1
remoteness	1
of	1
all	1
its	1
realities	1
from	1
his	1
ideal.	1
But	1
even	1
when	1
better	1
informed	1
they	1
seem	1
to	1
have	1
no	1
apprehension	1
of	1
the	1
full	1
force	1
of	1
the	1
discrepancy.	1
Take,	1
for	1
instance,	1
Gustave	1
Doré’s	1
drawing	1
of	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
watching	1
his	1
armour	1
in	1
the	1
inn-yard.	1
Whether	1
or	1
not	1
the	1
Venta	1
de	1
Quesada	1
on	1
the	1
Seville	1
road	1
is,	1
as	1
tradition	1
maintains,	1
the	1
inn	1
described	1
in	1
“Don	1
Quixote,”	1
beyond	1
all	1
question	1
it	1
was	1
just	1
such	1
an	1
inn-yard	1
as	1
the	1
one	1
behind	1
it	1
that	1
Cervantes	1
had	1
in	1
his	1
mind’s	1
eye,	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
on	1
just	1
such	1
a	1
rude	1
stone	1
trough	1
as	1
that	1
beside	1
the	1
primitive	1
draw-well	1
in	1
the	1
corner	1
that	1
he	1
meant	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
to	1
deposit	1
his	1
armour.	1
Gustave	1
Doré	1
makes	1
it	1
an	1
elaborate	1
fountain	1
such	1
as	1
no	1
arriero	1
ever	1
watered	1
his	1
mules	1
at	1
in	1
the	1
corral	1
of	1
any	1
venta	1
in	1
Spain,	1
and	1
thereby	1
entirely	1
misses	1
the	1
point	1
aimed	1
at	1
by	1
Cervantes.	1
It	1
is	1
the	1
mean,	1
prosaic,	1
commonplace	1
character	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
surroundings	1
and	1
circumstances	1
that	1
gives	1
a	1
significance	1
to	1
Don	1
Quixote’s	1
vigil	1
and	1
the	1
ceremony	1
that	1
follows.	1
Cervantes’	1
humour	1
is	1
for	1
the	1
most	1
part	1
of	1
that	1
broader	1
and	1
simpler	1
sort,	1
the	1
strength	1
of	1
which	1
lies	1
in	1
the	1
perception	1
of	1
the	1
incongruous.	1
It	1
is	1
the	1
incongruity	1
of	1
Sancho	1
in	1
all	1
his	1
ways,	1
words,	1
and	1
works,	1
with	1
the	1
ideas	1
and	1
aims	1
of	1
his	1
master,	1
quite	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
the	1
wonderful	1
vitality	1
and	1
truth	1
to	1
nature	1
of	1
the	1
character,	1
that	1
makes	1
him	1
the	1
most	1
humorous	1
creation	1
in	1
the	1
whole	1
range	1
of	1
fiction.	1
That	1
unsmiling	1
gravity	1
of	1
which	1
Cervantes	1
was	1
the	1
first	1
great	1
master,	1
“Cervantes’	1
serious	1
air,”	1
which	1
sits	1
naturally	1
on	1
Swift	1
alone,	1
perhaps,	1
of	1
later	1
humourists,	1
is	1
essential	1
to	1
this	1
kind	1
of	1
humour,	1
and	1
here	1
again	1
Cervantes	1
has	1
suffered	1
at	1
the	1
hands	1
of	1
his	1
interpreters.	1
Nothing,	1
unless	1
indeed	1
the	1
coarse	1
buffoonery	1
of	1
Phillips,	1
could	1
be	1
more	1
out	1
of	1
place	1
in	1
an	1
attempt	1
to	1
represent	1
Cervantes,	1
than	1
a	1
flippant,	1
would-be	1
facetious	1
style,	1
like	1
that	1
of	1
Motteux’s	1
version	1
for	1
example,	1
or	1
the	1
sprightly,	1
jaunty	1
air,	1
French	1
translators	1
sometimes	1
adopt.	1
It	1
is	1
the	1
grave	1
matter-of-factness	1
of	1
the	1
narrative,	1
and	1
the	1
apparent	1
unconsciousness	1
of	1
the	1
author	1
that	1
he	1
is	1
saying	1
anything	1
ludicrous,	1
anything	1
but	1
the	1
merest	1
commonplace,	1
that	1
give	1
its	1
peculiar	1
flavour	1
to	1
the	1
humour	1
of	1
Cervantes.	1
His,	1
in	1
fact,	1
is	1
the	1
exact	1
opposite	1
of	1
the	1
humour	1
of	1
Sterne	1
and	1
the	1
self-conscious	1
humourists.	1
Even	1
when	1
Uncle	1
Toby	1
is	1
at	1
his	1
best,	1
you	1
are	1
always	1
aware	1
of	1
“the	1
man	1
Sterne”	1
behind	1
him,	1
watching	1
you	1
over	1
his	1
shoulder	1
to	1
see	1
what	1
effect	1
he	1
is	1
producing.	1
Cervantes	1
always	1
leaves	1
you	1
alone	1
with	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
and	1
Sancho.	1
He	1
and	1
Swift	1
and	1
the	1
great	1
humourists	1
always	1
keep	1
themselves	1
out	1
of	1
sight,	1
or,	1
more	1
properly	1
speaking,	1
never	1
think	1
about	1
themselves	1
at	1
all,	1
unlike	1
our	1
latter-day	1
school	1
of	1
humourists,	1
who	1
seem	1
to	1
have	1
revived	1
the	1
old	1
horse-collar	1
method,	1
and	1
try	1
to	1
raise	1
a	1
laugh	1
by	1
some	1
grotesque	1
assumption	1
of	1
ignorance,	1
imbecility,	1
or	1
bad	1
taste.	1
It	1
is	1
true	1
that	1
to	1
do	1
full	1
justice	1
to	1
Spanish	1
humour	1
in	1
any	1
other	1
language	1
is	1
well-nigh	1
an	1
impossibility.	1
There	1
is	1
a	1
natural	1
gravity	1
and	1
a	1
sonorous	1
stateliness	1
about	1
Spanish,	1
be	1
it	1
ever	1
so	1
colloquial,	1
that	1
make	1
an	1
absurdity	1
doubly	1
absurd,	1
and	1
give	1
plausibility	1
to	1
the	1
most	1
preposterous	1
statement.	1
This	1
is	1
what	1
makes	1
Sancho	1
Panza’s	1
drollery	1
the	1
despair	1
of	1
the	1
conscientious	1
translator.	1
Sancho’s	1
curt	1
comments	1
can	1
never	1
fall	1
flat,	1
but	1
they	1
lose	1
half	1
their	1
flavour	1
when	1
transferred	1
from	1
their	1
native	1
Castilian	1
into	1
any	1
other	1
medium.	1
But	1
if	1
foreigners	1
have	1
failed	1
to	1
do	1
justice	1
to	1
the	1
humour	1
of	1
Cervantes,	1
they	1
are	1
no	1
worse	1
than	1
his	1
own	1
countrymen.	1
Indeed,	1
were	1
it	1
not	1
for	1
the	1
Spanish	1
peasant’s	1
relish	1
of	1
“Don	1
Quixote,”	1
one	1
might	1
be	1
tempted	1
to	1
think	1
that	1
the	1
great	1
humourist	1
was	1
not	1
looked	1
upon	1
as	1
a	1
humourist	1
at	1
all	1
in	1
his	1
own	1
country.	1
The	1
craze	1
of	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
seems,	1
in	1
some	1
instances,	1
to	1
have	1
communicated	1
itself	1
to	1
his	1
critics,	1
making	1
them	1
see	1
things	1
that	1
are	1
not	1
in	1
the	1
book	1
and	1
run	1
full	1
tilt	1
at	1
phantoms	1
that	1
have	1
no	1
existence	1
save	1
in	1
their	1
own	1
imaginations.	1
Like	1
a	1
good	1
many	1
critics	1
now-a-days,	1
they	1
forget	1
that	1
screams	1
are	1
not	1
criticism,	1
and	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
only	1
vulgar	1
tastes	1
that	1
are	1
influenced	1
by	1
strings	1
of	1
superlatives,	1
three-piled	1
hyperboles,	1
and	1
pompous	1
epithets.	1
But	1
what	1
strikes	1
one	1
as	1
particularly	1
strange	1
is	1
that	1
while	1
they	1
deal	1
in	1
extravagant	1
eulogies,	1
and	1
ascribe	1
all	1
manner	1
of	1
imaginary	1
ideas	1
and	1
qualities	1
to	1
Cervantes,	1
they	1
show	1
no	1
perception	1
of	1
the	1
quality	1
that	1
ninety-nine	1
out	1
of	1
a	1
hundred	1
of	1
his	1
readers	1
would	1
rate	1
highest	1
in	1
him,	1
and	1
hold	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
one	1
that	1
raises	1
him	1
above	1
all	1
rivalry.	1
To	1
speak	1
of	1
“Don	1
Quixote”	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
merely	1
a	1
humorous	1
book	1
would	1
be	1
a	1
manifest	1
misdescription.	1
Cervantes	1
at	1
times	1
makes	1
it	1
a	1
kind	1
of	1
commonplace	1
book	1
for	1
occasional	1
essays	1
and	1
criticisms,	1
or	1
for	1
the	1
observations	1
and	1
reflections	1
and	1
gathered	1
wisdom	1
of	1
a	1
long	1
and	1
stirring	1
life.	1
It	1
is	1
a	1
mine	1
of	1
shrewd	1
observation	1
on	1
mankind	1
and	1
human	1
nature.	1
Among	1
modern	1
novels	1
there	1
may	1
be,	1
here	1
and	1
there,	1
more	1
elaborate	1
studies	1
of	1
character,	1
but	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
book	1
richer	1
in	1
individualised	1
character.	1
What	1
Coleridge	1
said	1
of	1
Shakespeare	1
in	1
minimis	1
is	1
true	1
of	1
Cervantes;	1
he	1
never,	1
even	1
for	1
the	1
most	1
temporary	1
purpose,	1
puts	1
forward	1
a	1
lay	1
figure.	1
There	1
is	1
life	1
and	1
individuality	1
in	1
all	1
his	1
characters,	1
however	1
little	1
they	1
may	1
have	1
to	1
do,	1
or	1
however	1
short	1
a	1
time	1
they	1
may	1
be	1
before	1
the	1
reader.	1
Samson	1
Carrasco,	1
the	1
curate,	1
Teresa	1
Panza,	1
Altisidora,	1
even	1
the	1
two	1
students	1
met	1
on	1
the	1
road	1
to	1
the	1
cave	1
of	1
Montesinos,	1
all	1
live	1
and	1
move	1
and	1
have	1
their	1
being;	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
characteristic	1
of	1
the	1
broad	1
humanity	1
of	1
Cervantes	1
that	1
there	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
hateful	1
one	1
among	1
them	1
all.	1
Even	1
poor	1
Maritornes,	1
with	1
her	1
deplorable	1
morals,	1
has	1
a	1
kind	1
heart	1
of	1
her	1
own	1
and	1
“some	1
faint	1
and	1
distant	1
resemblance	1
to	1
a	1
Christian	1
about	1
her;”	1
and	1
as	1
for	1
Sancho,	1
though	1
on	1
dissection	1
we	1
fail	1
to	1
find	1
a	1
lovable	1
trait	1
in	1
him,	1
unless	1
it	1
be	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
dog-like	1
affection	1
for	1
his	1
master,	1
who	1
is	1
there	1
that	1
in	1
his	1
heart	1
does	1
not	1
love	1
him?	1
But	1
it	1
is,	1
after	1
all,	1
the	1
humour	1
of	1
“Don	1
Quixote”	1
that	1
distinguishes	1
it	1
from	1
all	1
other	1
books	1
of	1
the	1
romance	1
kind.	1
It	1
is	1
this	1
that	1
makes	1
it,	1
as	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
judicial-minded	1
of	1
modern	1
critics	1
calls	1
it,	1
“the	1
best	1
novel	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
beyond	1
all	1
comparison.”	1
It	1
is	1
its	1
varied	1
humour,	1
ranging	1
from	1
broad	1
farce	1
to	1
comedy	1
as	1
subtle	1
as	1
Shakespeare’s	1
or	1
Molière’s	1
that	1
has	1
naturalised	1
it	1
in	1
every	1
country	1
where	1
there	1
are	1
readers,	1
and	1
made	1
it	1
a	1
classic	1
in	1
every	1
language	1
that	1
has	1
a	1
literature.	1
THE	1
AUTHOR’S	1
PREFACE	1
Idle	1
reader:	1
thou	1
mayest	1
believe	1
me	1
without	1
any	1
oath	1
that	1
I	1
would	1
this	1
book,	1
as	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
child	1
of	1
my	1
brain,	1
were	1
the	1
fairest,	1
gayest,	1
and	1
cleverest	1
that	1
could	1
be	1
imagined.	1
But	1
I	1
could	1
not	1
counteract	1
Nature’s	1
law	1
that	1
everything	1
shall	1
beget	1
its	1
like;	1
and	1
what,	1
then,	1
could	1
this	1
sterile,	1
illtilled	1
wit	1
of	1
mine	1
beget	1
but	1
the	1
story	1
of	1
a	1
dry,	1
shrivelled,	1
whimsical	1
offspring,	1
full	1
of	1
thoughts	1
of	1
all	1
sorts	1
and	1
such	1
as	1
never	1
came	1
into	1
any	1
other	1
imagination—just	1
what	1
might	1
be	1
begotten	1
in	1
a	1
prison,	1
where	1
every	1
misery	1
is	1
lodged	1
and	1
every	1
doleful	1
sound	1
makes	1
its	1
dwelling?	1
Tranquillity,	1
a	1
cheerful	1
retreat,	1
pleasant	1
fields,	1
bright	1
skies,	1
murmuring	1
brooks,	1
peace	1
of	1
mind,	1
these	1
are	1
the	1
things	1
that	1
go	1
far	1
to	1
make	1
even	1
the	1
most	1
barren	1
muses	1
fertile,	1
and	1
bring	1
into	1
the	1
world	1
births	1
that	1
fill	1
it	1
with	1
wonder	1
and	1
delight.	1
Sometimes	1
when	1
a	1
father	1
has	1
an	1
ugly,	1
loutish	1
son,	1
the	1
love	1
he	1
bears	1
him	1
so	1
blindfolds	1
his	1
eyes	1
that	1
he	1
does	1
not	1
see	1
his	1
defects,	1
or,	1
rather,	1
takes	1
them	1
for	1
gifts	1
and	1
charms	1
of	1
mind	1
and	1
body,	1
and	1
talks	1
of	1
them	1
to	1
his	1
friends	1
as	1
wit	1
and	1
grace.	1
I,	1
however—for	1
though	1
I	1
pass	1
for	1
the	1
father,	1
I	1
am	1
but	1
the	1
stepfather	1
to	1
“Don	1
Quixote”—have	1
no	1
desire	1
to	1
go	1
with	1
the	1
current	1
of	1
custom,	1
or	1
to	1
implore	1
thee,	1
dearest	1
reader,	1
almost	1
with	1
tears	1
in	1
my	1
eyes,	1
as	1
others	1
do,	1
to	1
pardon	1
or	1
excuse	1
the	1
defects	1
thou	1
wilt	1
perceive	1
in	1
this	1
child	1
of	1
mine.	1
Thou	1
art	1
neither	1
its	1
kinsman	1
nor	1
its	1
friend,	1
thy	1
soul	1
is	1
thine	1
own	1
and	1
thy	1
will	1
as	1
free	1
as	1
any	1
man’s,	1
whate’er	1
he	1
be,	1
thou	1
art	1
in	1
thine	1
own	1
house	1
and	1
master	1
of	1
it	1
as	1
much	1
as	1
the	1
king	1
of	1
his	1
taxes	1
and	1
thou	1
knowest	1
the	1
common	1
saying,	1
“Under	1
my	1
cloak	1
I	1
kill	1
the	1
king;”	1
all	1
which	1
exempts	1
and	1
frees	1
thee	1
from	1
every	1
consideration	1
and	1
obligation,	1
and	1
thou	1
canst	1
say	1
what	1
thou	1
wilt	1
of	1
the	1
story	1
without	1
fear	1
of	1
being	1
abused	1
for	1
any	1
ill	1
or	1
rewarded	1
for	1
any	1
good	1
thou	1
mayest	1
say	1
of	1
it.	1
My	1
wish	1
would	1
be	1
simply	1
to	1
present	1
it	1
to	1
thee	1
plain	1
and	1
unadorned,	1
without	1
any	1
embellishment	1
of	1
preface	1
or	1
uncountable	1
muster	1
of	1
customary	1
sonnets,	1
epigrams,	1
and	1
eulogies,	1
such	1
as	1
are	1
commonly	1
put	1
at	1
the	1
beginning	1
of	1
books.	1
For	1
I	1
can	1
tell	1
thee,	1
though	1
composing	1
it	1
cost	1
me	1
some	1
labour,	1
I	1
found	1
none	1
greater	1
than	1
the	1
making	1
of	1
this	1
Preface	1
thou	1
art	1
now	1
reading.	1
Many	1
times	1
did	1
I	1
take	1
up	1
my	1
pen	1
to	1
write	1
it,	1
and	1
many	1
did	1
I	1
lay	1
it	1
down	1
again,	1
not	1
knowing	1
what	1
to	1
write.	1
One	1
of	1
these	1
times,	1
as	1
I	1
was	1
pondering	1
with	1
the	1
paper	1
before	1
me,	1
a	1
pen	1
in	1
my	1
ear,	1
my	1
elbow	1
on	1
the	1
desk,	1
and	1
my	1
cheek	1
in	1
my	1
hand,	1
thinking	1
of	1
what	1
I	1
should	1
say,	1
there	1
came	1
in	1
unexpectedly	1
a	1
certain	1
lively,	1
clever	1
friend	1
of	1
mine,	1
who,	1
seeing	1
me	1
so	1
deep	1
in	1
thought,	1
asked	1
the	1
reason;	1
to	1
which	1
I,	1
making	1
no	1
mystery	1
of	1
it,	1
answered	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
thinking	1
of	1
the	1
Preface	1
I	1
had	1
to	1
make	1
for	1
the	1
story	1
of	1
“Don	1
Quixote,”	1
which	1
so	1
troubled	1
me	1
that	1
I	1
had	1
a	1
mind	1
not	1
to	1
make	1
any	1
at	1
all,	1
nor	1
even	1
publish	1
the	1
achievements	1
of	1
so	1
noble	1
a	1
knight.	1
“For,	1
how	1
could	1
you	1
expect	1
me	1
not	1
to	1
feel	1
uneasy	1
about	1
what	1
that	1
ancient	1
lawgiver	1
they	1
call	1
the	1
Public	1
will	1
say	1
when	1
it	1
sees	1
me,	1
after	1
slumbering	1
so	1
many	1
years	1
in	1
the	1
silence	1
of	1
oblivion,	1
coming	1
out	1
now	1
with	1
all	1
my	1
years	1
upon	1
my	1
back,	1
and	1
with	1
a	1
book	1
as	1
dry	1
as	1
a	1
rush,	1
devoid	1
of	1
invention,	1
meagre	1
in	1
style,	1
poor	1
in	1
thoughts,	1
wholly	1
wanting	1
in	1
learning	1
and	1
wisdom,	1
without	1
quotations	1
in	1
the	1
margin	1
or	1
annotations	1
at	1
the	1
end,	1
after	1
the	1
fashion	1
of	1
other	1
books	1
I	1
see,	1
which,	1
though	1
all	1
fables	1
and	1
profanity,	1
are	1
so	1
full	1
of	1
maxims	1
from	1
Aristotle,	1
and	1
Plato,	1
and	1
the	1
whole	1
herd	1
of	1
philosophers,	1
that	1
they	1
fill	1
the	1
readers	1
with	1
amazement	1
and	1
convince	1
them	1
that	1
the	1
authors	1
are	1
men	1
of	1
learning,	1
erudition,	1
and	1
eloquence.	1
And	1
then,	1
when	1
they	1
quote	1
the	1
Holy	1
Scriptures!—anyone	1
would	1
say	1
they	1
are	1
St.	1
Thomases	1
or	1
other	1
doctors	1
of	1
the	1
Church,	1
observing	1
as	1
they	1
do	1
a	1
decorum	1
so	1
ingenious	1
that	1
in	1
one	1
sentence	1
they	1
describe	1
a	1
distracted	1
lover	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
next	1
deliver	1
a	1
devout	1
little	1
sermon	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
pleasure	1
and	1
a	1
treat	1
to	1
hear	1
and	1
read.	1
Of	1
all	1
this	1
there	1
will	1
be	1
nothing	1
in	1
my	1
book,	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
nothing	1
to	1
quote	1
in	1
the	1
margin	1
or	1
to	1
note	1
at	1
the	1
end,	1
and	1
still	1
less	1
do	1
I	1
know	1
what	1
authors	1
I	1
follow	1
in	1
it,	1
to	1
place	1
them	1
at	1
the	1
beginning,	1
as	1
all	1
do,	1
under	1
the	1
letters	1
A,	1
B,	1
C,	1
beginning	1
with	1
Aristotle	1
and	1
ending	1
with	1
Xenophon,	1
or	1
Zoilus,	1
or	1
Zeuxis,	1
though	1
one	1
was	1
a	1
slanderer	1
and	1
the	1
other	1
a	1
painter.	1
Also	1
my	1
book	1
must	1
do	1
without	1
sonnets	1
at	1
the	1
beginning,	1
at	1
least	1
sonnets	1
whose	1
authors	1
are	1
dukes,	1
marquises,	1
counts,	1
bishops,	1
ladies,	1
or	1
famous	1
poets.	1
Though	1
if	1
I	1
were	1
to	1
ask	1
two	1
or	1
three	1
obliging	1
friends,	1
I	1
know	1
they	1
would	1
give	1
me	1
them,	1
and	1
such	1
as	1
the	1
productions	1
of	1
those	1
that	1
have	1
the	1
highest	1
reputation	1
in	1
our	1
Spain	1
could	1
not	1
equal.	1
“In	1
short,	1
my	1
friend,”	1
I	1
continued,	1
“I	1
am	1
determined	1
that	1
Señor	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
shall	1
remain	1
buried	1
in	1
the	1
archives	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
La	1
Mancha	1
until	1
Heaven	1
provide	1
someone	1
to	1
garnish	1
him	1
with	1
all	1
those	1
things	1
he	1
stands	1
in	1
need	1
of;	1
because	1
I	1
find	1
myself,	1
through	1
my	1
shallowness	1
and	1
want	1
of	1
learning,	1
unequal	1
to	1
supplying	1
them,	1
and	1
because	1
I	1
am	1
by	1
nature	1
shy	1
and	1
careless	1
about	1
hunting	1
for	1
authors	1
to	1
say	1
what	1
I	1
myself	1
can	1
say	1
without	1
them.	1
Hence	1
the	1
cogitation	1
and	1
abstraction	1
you	1
found	1
me	1
in,	1
and	1
reason	1
enough,	1
what	1
you	1
have	1
heard	1
from	1
me.”	1
Hearing	1
this,	1
my	1
friend,	1
giving	1
himself	1
a	1
slap	1
on	1
the	1
forehead	1
and	1
breaking	1
into	1
a	1
hearty	1
laugh,	1
exclaimed,	1
“Before	1
God,	1
Brother,	1
now	1
am	1
I	1
disabused	1
of	1
an	1
error	1
in	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
been	1
living	1
all	1
this	1
long	1
time	1
I	1
have	1
known	1
you,	1
all	1
through	1
which	1
I	1
have	1
taken	1
you	1
to	1
be	1
shrewd	1
and	1
sensible	1
in	1
all	1
you	1
do;	1
but	1
now	1
I	1
see	1
you	1
are	1
as	1
far	1
from	1
that	1
as	1
the	1
heaven	1
is	1
from	1
the	1
earth.	1
It	1
is	1
possible	1
that	1
things	1
of	1
so	1
little	1
moment	1
and	1
so	1
easy	1
to	1
set	1
right	1
can	1
occupy	1
and	1
perplex	1
a	1
ripe	1
wit	1
like	1
yours,	1
fit	1
to	1
break	1
through	1
and	1
crush	1
far	1
greater	1
obstacles?	1
By	1
my	1
faith,	1
this	1
comes,	1
not	1
of	1
any	1
want	1
of	1
ability,	1
but	1
of	1
too	1
much	1
indolence	1
and	1
too	1
little	1
knowledge	1
of	1
life.	1
Do	1
you	1
want	1
to	1
know	1
if	1
I	1
am	1
telling	1
the	1
truth?	1
Well,	1
then,	1
attend	1
to	1
me,	1
and	1
you	1
will	1
see	1
how,	1
in	1
the	1
opening	1
and	1
shutting	1
of	1
an	1
eye,	1
I	1
sweep	1
away	1
all	1
your	1
difficulties,	1
and	1
supply	1
all	1
those	1
deficiencies	1
which	1
you	1
say	1
check	1
and	1
discourage	1
you	1
from	1
bringing	1
before	1
the	1
world	1
the	1
story	1
of	1
your	1
famous	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
the	1
light	1
and	1
mirror	1
of	1
all	1
knight-errantry.”	1
“Say	1
on,”	1
said	1
I,	1
listening	1
to	1
his	1
talk;	1
“how	1
do	1
you	1
propose	1
to	1
make	1
up	1
for	1
my	1
diffidence,	1
and	1
reduce	1
to	1
order	1
this	1
chaos	1
of	1
perplexity	1
I	1
am	1
in?”	1
To	1
which	1
he	1
made	1
answer,	1
“Your	1
first	1
difficulty	1
about	1
the	1
sonnets,	1
epigrams,	1
or	1
complimentary	1
verses	1
which	1
you	1
want	1
for	1
the	1
beginning,	1
and	1
which	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
by	1
persons	1
of	1
importance	1
and	1
rank,	1
can	1
be	1
removed	1
if	1
you	1
yourself	1
take	1
a	1
little	1
trouble	1
to	1
make	1
them;	1
you	1
can	1
afterwards	1
baptise	1

“With	1

adding	1
annotations	1
at	1
the	1

you	1
may	1
safely	1
do	1
it	1
in	1
this	1

If	1

any	1
giant	1
in	1

contrive	1
that	1
it	1
shall	1

with	1
this	1
alone,	1
which	1
will	1
cost	1
you	1
almost	1
nothing,	1
you	1
have	1
a	1

note,	1
for	1
you	1
can	1
put—_The	1

in	1
the	1

the	1

I	1
have	1
it	1
by	1
heart;	1

any	1

if	1
you	1

not	1

go	1
to	1
foreign	1

you	1
have	1
at	1

Fonseca’s	1
‘Of	1
the	1
Love	1
of	1
God,’	1
in	1
which	1
is	1
condensed	1
all	1
that	1
you	1
or	1
the	1
most	1
imaginative	1
mind	1
can	1
want	1
on	1
the	1
subject.	1
In	1
short,	1
all	1
you	1
have	1
to	1
do	1
is	1
to	1
manage	1
to	1
quote	1
these	1
names,	1
or	1
refer	1
to	1
these	1
stories	1
I	1
have	1
mentioned,	1
and	1
leave	1
it	1
to	1
me	1
to	1
insert	1
the	1
annotations	1
and	1
quotations,	1
and	1
I	1
swear	1
by	1
all	1
that’s	1
good	1
to	1
fill	1
your	1
margins	1
and	1
use	1
up	1
four	1
sheets	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
the	1
book.	1
“Now	1
let	1
us	1
come	1
to	1
those	1
references	1
to	1
authors	1
which	1
other	1
books	1
have,	1
and	1
you	1
want	1
for	1
yours.	1
The	1
remedy	1
for	1
this	1
is	1
very	1
simple:	1
You	1
have	1
only	1
to	1
look	1
out	1
for	1
some	1
book	1
that	1
quotes	1
them	1
all,	1
from	1
A	1
to	1
Z	1
as	1
you	1
say	1
yourself,	1
and	1
then	1
insert	1
the	1
very	1
same	1
alphabet	1
in	1
your	1
book,	1
and	1
though	1
the	1
imposition	1
may	1
be	1
plain	1
to	1
see,	1
because	1
you	1
have	1
so	1
little	1
need	1
to	1
borrow	1
from	1
them,	1
that	1
is	1
no	1
matter;	1
there	1
will	1
probably	1
be	1
some	1
simple	1
enough	1
to	1
believe	1
that	1
you	1
have	1
made	1
use	1
of	1
them	1
all	1
in	1
this	1
plain,	1
artless	1
story	1
of	1
yours.	1
At	1
any	1
rate,	1
if	1
it	1
answers	1
no	1
other	1
purpose,	1
this	1
long	1
catalogue	1
of	1
authors	1
will	1
serve	1
to	1
give	1
a	1
surprising	1
look	1
of	1
authority	1
to	1
your	1
book.	1
Besides,	1
no	1
one	1
will	1
trouble	1
himself	1
to	1
verify	1
whether	1
you	1
have	1
followed	1
them	1
or	1
whether	1
you	1
have	1
not,	1
being	1
no	1
way	1
concerned	1
in	1
it;	1
especially	1
as,	1
if	1
I	1
mistake	1
not,	1
this	1
book	1
of	1
yours	1
has	1
no	1
need	1
of	1
any	1
one	1
of	1
those	1
things	1
you	1
say	1
it	1
wants,	1
for	1
it	1
is,	1
from	1
beginning	1
to	1
end,	1
an	1
attack	1
upon	1
the	1
books	1
of	1
chivalry,	1
of	1
which	1
Aristotle	1
never	1
dreamt,	1
nor	1
St.	1
Basil	1
said	1
a	1
word,	1
nor	1
Cicero	1
had	1
any	1
knowledge;	1
nor	1
do	1
the	1
niceties	1
of	1
truth	1
nor	1
the	1
observations	1
of	1
astrology	1
come	1
within	1
the	1
range	1
of	1
its	1
fanciful	1
vagaries;	1
nor	1
have	1
geometrical	1
measurements	1
or	1
refutations	1
of	1
the	1
arguments	1
used	1
in	1
rhetoric	1
anything	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
it;	1
nor	1
does	1
it	1
mean	1
to	1
preach	1
to	1
anybody,	1
mixing	1
up	1
things	1
human	1
and	1
divine,	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
motley	1
in	1
which	1
no	1
Christian	1
understanding	1
should	1
dress	1
itself.	1
It	1
has	1
only	1
to	1
avail	1
itself	1
of	1
truth	1
to	1
nature	1
in	1
its	1
composition,	1
and	1
the	1
more	1
perfect	1
the	1
imitation	1
the	1
better	1
the	1
work	1
will	1
be.	1
And	1
as	1
this	1
piece	1
of	1
yours	1
aims	1
at	1
nothing	1
more	1
than	1
to	1
destroy	1
the	1
authority	1
and	1
influence	1
which	1
books	1
of	1
chivalry	1
have	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
public,	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
need	1
for	1
you	1
to	1
go	1
a-begging	1
for	1
aphorisms	1
from	1
philosophers,	1
precepts	1
from	1
Holy	1
Scripture,	1
fables	1
from	1
poets,	1
speeches	1
from	1
orators,	1
or	1
miracles	1
from	1
saints;	1
but	1
merely	1
to	1
take	1
care	1
that	1
your	1
style	1
and	1
diction	1
run	1
musically,	1
pleasantly,	1
and	1
plainly,	1
with	1
clear,	1
proper,	1
and	1
well-placed	1
words,	1
setting	1
forth	1
your	1
purpose	1
to	1
the	1
best	1
of	1
your	1
power,	1
and	1
putting	1
your	1
ideas	1
intelligibly,	1
without	1
confusion	1
or	1
obscurity.	1
Strive,	1
too,	1
that	1
in	1
reading	1
your	1
story	1
the	1
melancholy	1
may	1
be	1
moved	1
to	1
laughter,	1
and	1
the	1
merry	1
made	1
merrier	1
still;	1
that	1
the	1
simple	1
shall	1
not	1
be	1
wearied,	1
that	1
the	1
judicious	1
shall	1
admire	1
the	1
invention,	1
that	1
the	1
grave	1
shall	1
not	1
despise	1
it,	1
nor	1
the	1
wise	1
fail	1
to	1
praise	1
it.	1
Finally,	1
keep	1
your	1
aim	1
fixed	1
on	1
the	1
destruction	1
of	1
that	1
ill-founded	1
edifice	1
of	1
the	1
books	1
of	1
chivalry,	1
hated	1
by	1
some	1
and	1
praised	1
by	1
many	1
more;	1
for	1
if	1
you	1
succeed	1
in	1
this	1
you	1
will	1
have	1
achieved	1
no	1
small	1
success.”	1
In	1
profound	1
silence	1
I	1
listened	1
to	1
what	1
my	1
friend	1
said,	1
and	1
his	1
observations	1
made	1
such	1
an	1
impression	1
on	1
me	1
that,	1
without	1
attempting	1
to	1
question	1
them,	1
I	1
admitted	1
their	1
soundness,	1
and	1
out	1
of	1
them	1
I	1
determined	1
to	1
make	1
this	1
Preface;	1
wherein,	1
gentle	1
reader,	1
thou	1
wilt	1
perceive	1
my	1
friend’s	1
good	1
sense,	1
my	1
good	1
fortune	1
in	1
finding	1
such	1
an	1
adviser	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
time	1
of	1
need,	1
and	1
what	1
thou	1
hast	1
gained	1
in	1
receiving,	1
without	1
addition	1
or	1
alteration,	1
the	1
story	1
of	1
the	1
famous	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
of	1
La	1
Mancha,	1
who	1
is	1
held	1
by	1
all	1
the	1
inhabitants	1
of	1
the	1
district	1
of	1
the	1
Campo	1
de	1
Montiel	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
the	1
chastest	1
lover	1
and	1
the	1
bravest	1
knight	1
that	1
has	1
for	1
many	1
years	1
been	1
seen	1
in	1
that	1
neighbourhood.	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
desire	1
to	1
magnify	1
the	1
service	1
I	1
render	1
thee	1
in	1
making	1
thee	1
acquainted	1
with	1
so	1
renowned	1
and	1
honoured	1
a	1
knight,	1
but	1
I	1
do	1
desire	1
thy	1
thanks	1
for	1
the	1
acquaintance	1
thou	1
wilt	1
make	1
with	1
the	1
famous	1
Sancho	1
Panza,	1
his	1
squire,	1
in	1
whom,	1
to	1
my	1
thinking,	1
I	1
have	1
given	1
thee	1
condensed	1
all	1
the	1
squirely	1
drolleries	1
that	1
are	1
scattered	1
through	1
the	1
swarm	1
of	1
the	1
vain	1
books	1
of	1
chivalry.	1
And	1
so—may	1
God	1
give	1
thee	1
health,	1
and	1
not	1
forget	1
me.	1
Vale.	1

e’er	1

Thousands	1

a	1

use	1

doublet	1
of	1
fine	1
cloth	1
and	1
velvet	1
breeches	1
and	1
shoes	1
to	1
match	1
for	1
holidays,	1
while	1
on	1
week-days	1
he	1
made	1
a	1
brave	1
figure	1
in	1
his	1
best	1
homespun.	1
He	1
had	1
in	1
his	1
house	1
a	1
housekeeper	1
past	1
forty,	1
a	1
niece	1
under	1
twenty,	1
and	1
a	1
lad	1
for	1
the	1
field	1
and	1
market-place,	1
who	1
used	1
to	1
saddle	1
the	1
hack	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
handle	1
the	1
bill-hook.	1
The	1
age	1
of	1
this	1
gentleman	1
of	1
ours	1
was	1
bordering	1
on	1
fifty;	1
he	1
was	1
of	1
a	1
hardy	1
habit,	1
spare,	1
gaunt-featured,	1
a	1
very	1
early	1
riser	1
and	1
a	1
great	1
sportsman.	1
They	1
will	1
have	1
it	1
his	1
surname	1
was	1
Quixada	1
or	1
Quesada	1
(for	1
here	1
there	1
is	1
some	1
difference	1
of	1
opinion	1
among	1
the	1
authors	1
who	1
write	1
on	1
the	1
subject),	1
although	1
from	1
reasonable	1
conjectures	1
it	1
seems	1
plain	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
called	1
Quexana.	1
This,	1
however,	1
is	1
of	1
but	1
little	1
importance	1
to	1
our	1
tale;	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
enough	1
not	1
to	1
stray	1
a	1
hair’s	1
breadth	1
from	1
the	1
truth	1
in	1
the	1
telling	1
of	1
it.	1
You	1
must	1
know,	1
then,	1
that	1
the	1
above-named	1
gentleman	1
whenever	1
he	1
was	1
at	1
leisure	1
(which	1
was	1
mostly	1
all	1
the	1
year	1
round)	1
gave	1
himself	1
up	1
to	1
reading	1
books	1
of	1
chivalry	1
with	1
such	1
ardour	1
and	1
avidity	1
that	1
he	1
almost	1
entirely	1
neglected	1
the	1
pursuit	1
of	1
his	1
field-sports,	1
and	1
even	1
the	1
management	1
of	1
his	1
property;	1
and	1
to	1
such	1
a	1
pitch	1
did	1
his	1
eagerness	1
and	1
infatuation	1
go	1
that	1
he	1
sold	1
many	1
an	1
acre	1
of	1
tillageland	1
to	1
buy	1
books	1
of	1
chivalry	1
to	1
read,	1
and	1
brought	1
home	1
as	1
many	1
of	1
them	1
as	1
he	1
could	1
get.	1
But	1
of	1
all	1
there	1
were	1
none	1
he	1
liked	1
so	1
well	1
as	1
those	1
of	1
the	1
famous	1
Feliciano	1
de	1
Silva’s	1
composition,	1
for	1
their	1
lucidity	1
of	1
style	1
and	1
complicated	1
conceits	1
were	1
as	1
pearls	1
in	1
his	1
sight,	1
particularly	1
when	1
in	1
his	1
reading	1
he	1
came	1
upon	1
courtships	1
and	1
cartels,	1
where	1
he	1
often	1
found	1
passages	1
like	1
“_the	1
reason	1
of	1
the	1
unreason	1
with	1
which	1
my	1
reason	1
is	1
afflicted	1
so	1
weakens	1
my	1
reason	1
that	1
with	1
reason	1
I	1
murmur	1
at	1
your	1
beauty;”	1
or	1
again,	1
“the	1
high	1
heavens,	1
that	1
of	1
your	1
divinity	1
divinely	1
fortify	1
you	1
with	1
the	1
stars,	1
render	1
you	1
deserving	1
of	1
the	1
desert	1
your	1
greatness	1
deserves_.”	1
Over	1
conceits	1
of	1
this	1
sort	1
the	1
poor	1
gentleman	1
lost	1
his	1
wits,	1
and	1
used	1
to	1
lie	1
awake	1
striving	1
to	1
understand	1
them	1
and	1
worm	1
the	1
meaning	1
out	1
of	1
them;	1
what	1
Aristotle	1
himself	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
made	1
out	1
or	1
extracted	1
had	1
he	1
come	1
to	1
life	1
again	1
for	1
that	1
special	1
purpose.	1
He	1
was	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
easy	1
about	1
the	1
wounds	1
which	1
Don	1
Belianis	1
gave	1
and	1
took,	1
because	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
that,	1
great	1
as	1
were	1
the	1
surgeons	1
who	1
had	1
cured	1
him,	1
he	1
must	1
have	1
had	1
his	1
face	1
and	1
body	1
covered	1
all	1
over	1
with	1
seams	1
and	1
scars.	1
He	1
commended,	1
however,	1
the	1
author’s	1
way	1
of	1
ending	1
his	1
book	1
with	1
the	1
promise	1
of	1
that	1
interminable	1
adventure,	1
and	1
many	1
a	1
time	1
was	1
he	1
tempted	1
to	1
take	1
up	1
his	1
pen	1
and	1
finish	1
it	1
properly	1
as	1
is	1
there	1
proposed,	1
which	1
no	1
doubt	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
done,	1
and	1
made	1
a	1
successful	1
piece	1
of	1
work	1
of	1
it	1
too,	1
had	1
not	1
greater	1
and	1
more	1
absorbing	1
thoughts	1
prevented	1
him.	1
Many	1
an	1
argument	1
did	1
he	1
have	1
with	1
the	1
curate	1
of	1
his	1
village	1
(a	1
learned	1
man,	1
and	1
a	1
graduate	1
of	1
Siguenza)	1
as	1
to	1
which	1
had	1
been	1
the	1
better	1
knight,	1
Palmerin	1
of	1
England	1
or	1
Amadis	1
of	1
Gaul.	1
Master	1
Nicholas,	1
the	1
village	1
barber,	1
however,	1
used	1
to	1
say	1
that	1
neither	1
of	1
them	1
came	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
Knight	1
of	1
Phœbus,	1
and	1
that	1
if	1
there	1
was	1
any	1
that	1
could	1
compare	1
with	1
_him_	1
it	1
was	1
Don	1
Galaor,	1
the	1
brother	1
of	1
Amadis	1
of	1
Gaul,	1
because	1
he	1
had	1
a	1
spirit	1
that	1
was	1
equal	1
to	1
every	1
occasion,	1
and	1
was	1
no	1
finikin	1
knight,	1
nor	1
lachrymose	1
like	1
his	1
brother,	1
while	1
in	1
the	1
matter	1
of	1
valour	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
a	1
whit	1
behind	1
him.	1
In	1
short,	1
he	1
became	1
so	1
absorbed	1
in	1
his	1
books	1
that	1
he	1
spent	1
his	1
nights	1
from	1
sunset	1
to	1
sunrise,	1
and	1
his	1
days	1
from	1
dawn	1
to	1
dark,	1
poring	1
over	1
them;	1
and	1
what	1
with	1
little	1
sleep	1
and	1
much	1
reading	1
his	1
brains	1
got	1
so	1
dry	1
that	1
he	1
lost	1
his	1
wits.	1
His	1
fancy	1
grew	1
full	1
of	1
what	1
he	1
used	1
to	1
read	1
about	1
in	1
his	1
books,	1
enchantments,	1
quarrels,	1
battles,	1
challenges,	1
wounds,	1
wooings,	1
loves,	1
agonies,	1
and	1
all	1
sorts	1
of	1
impossible	1
nonsense;	1
and	1
it	1
so	1
possessed	1
his	1
mind	1
that	1
the	1
whole	1
fabric	1
of	1
invention	1
and	1
fancy	1
he	1
read	1
of	1
was	1
true,	1
that	1
to	1
him	1
no	1
history	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
had	1
more	1
reality	1
in	1
it.	1
He	1
used	1
to	1
say	1
the	1
Cid	1
Ruy	1
Diaz	1
was	1
a	1
very	1
good	1
knight,	1
but	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
compared	1
with	1
the	1
Knight	1
of	1
the	1
Burning	1
Sword	1
who	1
with	1
one	1
back-stroke	1
cut	1
in	1
half	1
two	1
fierce	1
and	1
monstrous	1
giants.	1
He	1
thought	1
more	1
of	1
Bernardo	1
del	1
Carpio	1
because	1
at	1
Roncesvalles	1
he	1
slew	1
Roland	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
enchantments,	1
availing	1
himself	1
of	1
the	1
artifice	1
of	1
Hercules	1
when	1
he	1
strangled	1
Antæus	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
Terra	1
in	1
his	1
arms.	1
He	1
approved	1
highly	1
of	1
the	1
giant	1
Morgante,	1
because,	1
although	1
of	1
the	1
giant	1
breed	1
which	1
is	1
always	1
arrogant	1
and	1
ill-conditioned,	1
he	1
alone	1
was	1
affable	1
and	1
well-bred.	1
But	1
above	1
all	1
he	1
admired	1
Reinaldos	1
of	1
Montalban,	1
especially	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
him	1
sallying	1
forth	1
from	1
his	1
castle	1
and	1
robbing	1
everyone	1
he	1
met,	1
and	1
when	1
beyond	1
the	1
seas	1
he	1
stole	1
that	1
image	1
of	1
Mahomet	1
which,	1
as	1
his	1
history	1
says,	1
was	1
entirely	1
of	1
gold.	1
To	1
have	1
a	1
bout	1
of	1
kicking	1
at	1
that	1
traitor	1
of	1
a	1
Ganelon	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
given	1
his	1
housekeeper,	1
and	1
his	1
niece	1
into	1
the	1
bargain.	1
In	1
short,	1
his	1
wits	1
being	1
quite	1
gone,	1
he	1
hit	1
upon	1
the	1
strangest	1
notion	1
that	1
ever	1
madman	1
in	1
this	1
world	1
hit	1
upon,	1
and	1
that	1
was	1
that	1
he	1
fancied	1
it	1
was	1
right	1
and	1
requisite,	1
as	1
well	1
for	1
the	1
support	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
honour	1
as	1
for	1
the	1
service	1
of	1
his	1
country,	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
make	1
a	1
knight-errant	1
of	1
himself,	1
roaming	1
the	1
world	1
over	1
in	1
full	1
armour	1
and	1
on	1
horseback	1
in	1
quest	1
of	1
adventures,	1
and	1
putting	1
in	1
practice	1
himself	1
all	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
read	1
of	1
as	1
being	1
the	1
usual	1
practices	1
of	1
knights-errant;	1
righting	1
every	1
kind	1
of	1
wrong,	1
and	1
exposing	1
himself	1
to	1
peril	1
and	1
danger	1
from	1
which,	1
in	1
the	1
issue,	1
he	1
was	1
to	1
reap	1
eternal	1
renown	1
and	1
fame.	1
Already	1
the	1
poor	1
man	1
saw	1
himself	1
crowned	1
by	1
the	1
might	1
of	1
his	1
arm	1
Emperor	1
of	1
Trebizond	1
at	1
least;	1
and	1
so,	1
led	1
away	1
by	1
the	1
intense	1
enjoyment	1
he	1
found	1
in	1
these	1
pleasant	1
fancies,	1
he	1
set	1
himself	1
forthwith	1
to	1
put	1
his	1
scheme	1
into	1
execution.	1
The	1
first	1
thing	1
he	1
did	1
was	1
to	1
clean	1
up	1
some	1
armour	1
that	1
had	1
belonged	1
to	1
his	1
great-grandfather,	1
and	1
had	1
been	1
for	1
ages	1
lying	1
forgotten	1
in	1
a	1
corner	1
eaten	1
with	1
rust	1
and	1
covered	1
with	1
mildew.	1
He	1
scoured	1
and	1
polished	1
it	1
as	1
best	1
he	1
could,	1
but	1
he	1
perceived	1
one	1
great	1
defect	1
in	1
it,	1
that	1
it	1
had	1
no	1
closed	1
helmet,	1
nothing	1
but	1
a	1
simple	1
morion.	1
This	1
deficiency,	1
however,	1
his	1
ingenuity	1
supplied,	1
for	1
he	1
contrived	1
a	1
kind	1
of	1
half-helmet	1
of	1
pasteboard	1
which,	1
fitted	1
on	1
to	1
the	1
morion,	1
looked	1
like	1
a	1
whole	1
one.	1
It	1
is	1
true	1
that,	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
see	1
if	1
it	1
was	1
strong	1
and	1
fit	1
to	1
stand	1
a	1
cut,	1
he	1
drew	1
his	1
sword	1
and	1
gave	1
it	1
a	1
couple	1
of	1
slashes,	1
the	1
first	1
of	1
which	1
undid	1
in	1
an	1
instant	1
what	1
had	1
taken	1
him	1
a	1
week	1
to	1
do.	1
The	1
ease	1
with	1
which	1
he	1
had	1
knocked	1
it	1
to	1
pieces	1
disconcerted	1
him	1
somewhat,	1
and	1
to	1
guard	1
against	1
that	1
danger	1
he	1
set	1
to	1
work	1
again,	1
fixing	1
bars	1
of	1
iron	1
on	1
the	1
inside	1
until	1
he	1
was	1
satisfied	1
with	1
its	1
strength;	1
and	1
then,	1
not	1
caring	1
to	1
try	1
any	1
more	1
experiments	1
with	1
it,	1
he	1
passed	1
it	1
and	1
adopted	1
it	1
as	1
a	1
helmet	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
perfect	1
construction.	1
He	1
next	1
proceeded	1
to	1
inspect	1
his	1
hack,	1
which,	1
with	1
more	1
quartos	1
than	1
a	1
real	1
and	1
more	1
blemishes	1
than	1
the	1
steed	1
of	1
Gonela,	1
that	1
“_tantum	1
pellis	1
et	1
ossa	1
fuit_,”	1
surpassed	1
in	1
his	1
eyes	1
the	1
Bucephalus	1
of	1
Alexander	1
or	1
the	1
Babieca	1
of	1
the	1
Cid.	1
Four	1
days	1
were	1
spent	1
in	1
thinking	1
what	1
name	1
to	1
give	1
him,	1
because	1
(as	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
himself)	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
right	1
that	1
a	1
horse	1
belonging	1
to	1
a	1
knight	1
so	1
famous,	1
and	1
one	1
with	1
such	1
merits	1
of	1
his	1
own,	1
should	1
be	1
without	1
some	1
distinctive	1
name,	1
and	1
he	1
strove	1
to	1
adapt	1
it	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
indicate	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
before	1
belonging	1
to	1
a	1
knight-errant,	1
and	1
what	1
he	1
then	1
was;	1
for	1
it	1
was	1
only	1
reasonable	1
that,	1
his	1
master	1
taking	1
a	1
new	1
character,	1
he	1
should	1
take	1
a	1
new	1
name,	1
and	1
that	1
it	1
should	1
be	1
a	1
distinguished	1
and	1
full-sounding	1
one,	1
befitting	1
the	1
new	1
order	1
and	1
calling	1
he	1
was	1
about	1
to	1
follow.	1
And	1
so,	1
after	1
having	1
composed,	1
struck	1
out,	1
rejected,	1
added	1
to,	1
unmade,	1
and	1
remade	1
a	1
multitude	1
of	1
names	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
memory	1
and	1
fancy,	1
he	1
decided	1
upon	1
calling	1
him	1
Rocinante,	1
a	1
name,	1
to	1
his	1
thinking,	1
lofty,	1
sonorous,	1
and	1
significant	1
of	1
his	1
condition	1
as	1
a	1
hack	1
before	1
he	1
became	1
what	1
he	1
now	1
was,	1
the	1
first	1
and	1
foremost	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
hacks	1
in	1
the	1
world.	1
Having	1
got	1
a	1
name	1
for	1
his	1
horse	1
so	1
much	1
to	1
his	1
taste,	1
he	1
was	1
anxious	1
to	1
get	1
one	1
for	1
himself,	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
eight	1
days	1
more	1
pondering	1
over	1
this	1
point,	1
till	1
at	1
last	1
he	1
made	1
up	1
his	1
mind	1
to	1
call	1
himself	1
“Don	1
Quixote,”	1
whence,	1
as	1
has	1
been	1
already	1
said,	1
the	1
authors	1
of	1
this	1
veracious	1
history	1
have	1
inferred	1
that	1
his	1
name	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
beyond	1
a	1
doubt	1
Quixada,	1
and	1
not	1
Quesada	1
as	1
others	1
would	1
have	1
it.	1
Recollecting,	1
however,	1
that	1
the	1
valiant	1
Amadis	1
was	1
not	1
content	1
to	1
call	1
himself	1
curtly	1
Amadis	1
and	1
nothing	1
more,	1
but	1
added	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
his	1
kingdom	1
and	1
country	1
to	1
make	1
it	1
famous,	1
and	1
called	1
himself	1
Amadis	1
of	1
Gaul,	1
he,	1
like	1
a	1
good	1
knight,	1
resolved	1
to	1
add	1
on	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
his,	1
and	1
to	1
style	1
himself	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
of	1
La	1
Mancha,	1
whereby,	1
he	1
considered,	1
he	1
described	1
accurately	1
his	1
origin	1
and	1
country,	1
and	1
did	1
honour	1
to	1
it	1
in	1
taking	1
his	1
surname	1
from	1
it.	1
So	1
then,	1
his	1
armour	1
being	1
furbished,	1
his	1
morion	1
turned	1
into	1
a	1
helmet,	1
his	1
hack	1
christened,	1
and	1
he	1
himself	1
confirmed,	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
conclusion	1
that	1
nothing	1
more	1
was	1
needed	1
now	1
but	1
to	1
look	1
out	1
for	1
a	1
lady	1
to	1
be	1
in	1
love	1
with;	1
for	1
a	1
knight-errant	1
without	1
love	1
was	1
like	1
a	1
tree	1
without	1
leaves	1
or	1
fruit,	1
or	1
a	1
body	1
without	1
a	1
soul.	1
As	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
himself,	1
“If,	1
for	1
my	1
sins,	1
or	1
by	1
my	1
good	1
fortune,	1
I	1
come	1
across	1
some	1
giant	1
hereabouts,	1
a	1
common	1
occurrence	1
with	1
knights-errant,	1
and	1
overthrow	1
him	1
in	1
one	1
onslaught,	1
or	1
cleave	1
him	1
asunder	1
to	1
the	1
waist,	1
or,	1
in	1
short,	1
vanquish	1
and	1
subdue	1
him,	1
will	1
it	1
not	1
be	1
well	1
to	1
have	1
someone	1
I	1
may	1
send	1
him	1
to	1
as	1
a	1
present,	1
that	1
he	1
may	1
come	1
in	1
and	1
fall	1
on	1
his	1
knees	1
before	1
my	1
sweet	1
lady,	1
and	1
in	1
a	1
humble,	1
submissive	1
voice	1
say,	1
‘I	1
am	1
the	1
giant	1
Caraculiambro,	1
lord	1
of	1
the	1
island	1
of	1
Malindrania,	1
vanquished	1
in	1
single	1
combat	1
by	1
the	1
never	1
sufficiently	1
extolled	1
knight	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
of	1
La	1
Mancha,	1
who	1
has	1
commanded	1
me	1
to	1
present	1
myself	1
before	1
your	1
Grace,	1
that	1
your	1
Highness	1
dispose	1
of	1
me	1
at	1
your	1
pleasure’?”	1
Oh,	1
how	1
our	1
good	1
gentleman	1
enjoyed	1
the	1
delivery	1
of	1
this	1
speech,	1
especially	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
thought	1
of	1
someone	1
to	1
call	1
his	1
Lady!	1
There	1
was,	1
so	1
the	1
story	1
goes,	1
in	1
a	1
village	1
near	1
his	1
own	1
a	1
very	1
good-looking	1
farm-girl	1
with	1
whom	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
at	1
one	1
time	1
in	1
love,	1
though,	1
so	1
far	1
as	1
is	1
known,	1
she	1
never	1
knew	1
it	1
nor	1
gave	1
a	1
thought	1
to	1
the	1
matter.	1
Her	1
name	1
was	1
Aldonza	1
Lorenzo,	1
and	1
upon	1
her	1
he	1
thought	1
fit	1
to	1
confer	1
the	1
title	1
of	1
Lady	1
of	1
his	1
Thoughts;	1
and	1
after	1
some	1
search	1
for	1
a	1
name	1
which	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
out	1
of	1
harmony	1
with	1
her	1
own,	1
and	1
should	1
suggest	1
and	1
indicate	1
that	1
of	1
a	1
princess	1
and	1
great	1
lady,	1
he	1
decided	1
upon	1
calling	1
her	1
Dulcinea	1
del	1
Toboso—she	1
being	1
of	1
El	1
Toboso—a	1
name,	1
to	1
his	1
mind,	1
musical,	1
uncommon,	1
and	1
significant,	1
like	1
all	1
those	1
he	1
had	1
already	1
bestowed	1
upon	1
himself	1
and	1
the	1
things	1
belonging	1
to	1
him.	1

These	1
preliminaries	1
settled,	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
care	1
to	1
put	1
off	1
any	1
longer	1
the	1
execution	1
of	1
his	1
design,	1
urged	1
on	1
to	1
it	1
by	1
the	1
thought	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
world	1
was	1
losing	1
by	1
his	1
delay,	1
seeing	1
what	1
wrongs	1
he	1
intended	1
to	1
right,	1
grievances	1
to	1
redress,	1
injustices	1
to	1
repair,	1
abuses	1
to	1
remove,	1
and	1
duties	1
to	1
discharge.	1
So,	1
without	1
giving	1
notice	1
of	1
his	1
intention	1
to	1
anyone,	1
and	1
without	1
anybody	1
seeing	1
him,	1
one	1
morning	1
before	1
the	1
dawning	1
of	1
the	1
day	1
(which	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
hottest	1
of	1
the	1
month	1
of	1
July)	1
he	1
donned	1
his	1
suit	1
of	1
armour,	1
mounted	1
Rocinante	1
with	1
his	1
patched-up	1
helmet	1
on,	1
braced	1
his	1
buckler,	1
took	1
his	1
lance,	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
back	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
yard	1
sallied	1
forth	1
upon	1
the	1
plain	1
in	1
the	1
highest	1
contentment	1
and	1
satisfaction	1
at	1
seeing	1
with	1
what	1
ease	1
he	1
had	1
made	1
a	1
beginning	1
with	1
his	1
grand	1
purpose.	1
But	1
scarcely	1
did	1
he	1
find	1
himself	1
upon	1
the	1
open	1
plain,	1
when	1
a	1
terrible	1
thought	1
struck	1
him,	1
one	1
all	1
but	1
enough	1
to	1
make	1
him	1
abandon	1
the	1
enterprise	1
at	1
the	1
very	1
outset.	1
It	1
occurred	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
dubbed	1
a	1
knight,	1
and	1
that	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
chivalry	1
he	1
neither	1
could	1
nor	1
ought	1
to	1
bear	1
arms	1
against	1
any	1
knight;	1
and	1
that	1
even	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
been,	1
still	1
he	1
ought,	1
as	1
a	1
novice	1
knight,	1
to	1
wear	1
white	1
armour,	1
without	1
a	1
device	1
upon	1
the	1
shield	1
until	1
by	1
his	1
prowess	1
he	1
had	1
earned	1
one.	1
These	1
reflections	1
made	1
him	1
waver	1
in	1
his	1
purpose,	1
but	1
his	1
craze	1
being	1
stronger	1
than	1
any	1
reasoning,	1
he	1
made	1
up	1
his	1
mind	1
to	1
have	1
himself	1
dubbed	1
a	1
knight	1
by	1
the	1
first	1
one	1
he	1
came	1
across,	1
following	1
the	1
example	1
of	1
others	1
in	1
the	1
same	1
case,	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
read	1
in	1
the	1
books	1
that	1
brought	1
him	1
to	1
this	1
pass.	1
As	1
for	1
white	1
armour,	1
he	1
resolved,	1
on	1
the	1
first	1
opportunity,	1
to	1
scour	1
his	1
until	1
it	1
was	1
whiter	1
than	1
an	1
ermine;	1
and	1
so	1
comforting	1
himself	1
he	1
pursued	1
his	1
way,	1
taking	1
that	1
which	1
his	1
horse	1
chose,	1
for	1
in	1
this	1
he	1
believed	1
lay	1
the	1
essence	1
of	1
adventures.	1
Thus	1
setting	1
out,	1
our	1
new-fledged	1
adventurer	1
paced	1
along,	1
talking	1
to	1
himself	1
and	1
saying,	1
“Who	1
knows	1
but	1
that	1
in	1
time	1
to	1
come,	1
when	1
the	1
veracious	1
history	1
of	1
my	1
famous	1
deeds	1
is	1
made	1
known,	1
the	1
sage	1
who	1
writes	1
it,	1
when	1
he	1
has	1
to	1
set	1
forth	1
my	1
first	1
sally	1
in	1
the	1
early	1
morning,	1
will	1
do	1
it	1
after	1
this	1
fashion?	1
‘Scarce	1
had	1
the	1
rubicund	1
Apollo	1
spread	1
o’er	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
the	1
broad	1
spacious	1
earth	1
the	1
golden	1
threads	1
of	1
his	1
bright	1
hair,	1
scarce	1
had	1
the	1
little	1
birds	1
of	1
painted	1
plumage	1
attuned	1
their	1
notes	1
to	1
hail	1
with	1
dulcet	1
and	1
mellifluous	1
harmony	1
the	1
coming	1
of	1
the	1
rosy	1
Dawn,	1
that,	1
deserting	1
the	1
soft	1
couch	1
of	1
her	1
jealous	1
spouse,	1
was	1
appearing	1
to	1
mortals	1
at	1
the	1
gates	1
and	1
balconies	1
of	1
the	1
Manchegan	1
horizon,	1
when	1
the	1
renowned	1
knight	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
of	1
La	1
Mancha,	1
quitting	1
the	1
lazy	1
down,	1
mounted	1
his	1
celebrated	1
steed	1
Rocinante	1
and	1
began	1
to	1
traverse	1
the	1
ancient	1
and	1
famous	1
Campo	1
de	1
Montiel;’”	1
which	1
in	1
fact	1
he	1
was	1
actually	1
traversing.	1
“Happy	1
the	1
age,	1
happy	1
the	1
time,”	1
he	1
continued,	1
“in	1
which	1
shall	1
be	1
made	1
known	1
my	1
deeds	1
of	1
fame,	1
worthy	1
to	1
be	1
moulded	1
in	1
brass,	1
carved	1
in	1
marble,	1
limned	1
in	1
pictures,	1
for	1
a	1
memorial	1
for	1
ever.	1
And	1
thou,	1
O	1
sage	1
magician,	1
whoever	1
thou	1
art,	1
to	1
whom	1
it	1
shall	1
fall	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
chronicler	1
of	1
this	1
wondrous	1
history,	1
forget	1
not,	1
I	1
entreat	1
thee,	1
my	1
good	1
Rocinante,	1
the	1
constant	1
companion	1
of	1
my	1
ways	1
and	1
wanderings.”	1
Presently	1
he	1
broke	1
out	1
again,	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
were	1
love-stricken	1
in	1
earnest,	1
“O	1
Princess	1
Dulcinea,	1
lady	1
of	1
this	1
captive	1
heart,	1
a	1
grievous	1
wrong	1
hast	1
thou	1
done	1
me	1
to	1
drive	1
me	1
forth	1
with	1
scorn,	1
and	1
with	1
inexorable	1
obduracy	1
banish	1
me	1
from	1
the	1
presence	1
of	1
thy	1
beauty.	1
O	1
lady,	1
deign	1
to	1
hold	1
in	1
remembrance	1
this	1
heart,	1
thy	1
vassal,	1
that	1
thus	1
in	1
anguish	1
pines	1
for	1
love	1
of	1
thee.”	1
So	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
stringing	1
together	1
these	1
and	1
other	1
absurdities,	1
all	1
in	1
the	1
style	1
of	1
those	1
his	1
books	1
had	1
taught	1
him,	1
imitating	1
their	1
language	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
he	1
could;	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
while	1
he	1
rode	1
so	1
slowly	1
and	1
the	1
sun	1
mounted	1
so	1
rapidly	1
and	1
with	1
such	1
fervour	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
enough	1
to	1
melt	1
his	1
brains	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
any.	1
Nearly	1
all	1
day	1
he	1
travelled	1
without	1
anything	1
remarkable	1
happening	1
to	1
him,	1
at	1
which	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
despair,	1
for	1
he	1
was	1
anxious	1
to	1
encounter	1
someone	1
at	1
once	1
upon	1
whom	1
to	1
try	1
the	1
might	1
of	1
his	1
strong	1
arm.	1

Writers	1
there	1
are	1
who	1
say	1
the	1
first	1
adventure	1
he	1
met	1
with	1
was	1
that	1
of	1
Puerto	1
Lapice;	1
others	1
say	1
it	1
was	1
that	1
of	1
the	1

what	1
I	1

on	1

and	1
what	1
I	1
have	1
found	1
written	1
in	1
the	1
annals	1
of	1
La	1
Mancha,	1
is	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
on	1
the	1
road	1
all	1
day,	1
and	1
towards	1
nightfall	1
his	1
hack	1
and	1
he	1
found	1
themselves	1
dead	1
tired	1
and	1
hungry,	1
when,	1
looking	1
all	1
around	1
to	1
see	1
if	1
he	1
could	1
discover	1
any	1
castle	1
or	1
shepherd’s	1
shanty	1
where	1
he	1
might	1
refresh	1
himself	1
and	1
relieve	1
his	1
sore	1
wants,	1
he	1
perceived	1
not	1
far	1
out	1
of	1
his	1
road	1
an	1
inn,	1
which	1
was	1
as	1
welcome	1
as	1
a	1
star	1
guiding	1
him	1
to	1
the	1
portals,	1
if	1
not	1
the	1
palaces,	1
of	1
his	1
redemption;	1
and	1
quickening	1
his	1
pace	1
he	1
reached	1
it	1
just	1
as	1
night	1
was	1
setting	1
in.	1
At	1
the	1
door	1
were	1
standing	1
two	1
young	1
women,	1
girls	1
of	1
the	1
district	1
as	1
they	1
call	1
them,	1
on	1
their	1
way	1
to	1
Seville	1
with	1
some	1
carriers	1
who	1
had	1
chanced	1
to	1
halt	1
that	1
night	1
at	1
the	1
inn;	1
and	1
as,	1
happen	1
what	1
might	1
to	1
our	1
adventurer,	1
everything	1
he	1
saw	1
or	1
imagined	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
and	1
to	1
happen	1
after	1
the	1
fashion	1
of	1
what	1
he	1
read	1
of,	1
the	1
moment	1
he	1
saw	1
the	1
inn	1
he	1
pictured	1
it	1
to	1
himself	1
as	1
a	1
castle	1
with	1
its	1
four	1
turrets	1
and	1
pinnacles	1
of	1
shining	1
silver,	1
not	1
forgetting	1
the	1
drawbridge	1
and	1
moat	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
belongings	1
usually	1
ascribed	1
to	1
castles	1
of	1
the	1
sort.	1
To	1
this	1
inn,	1
which	1
to	1
him	1
seemed	1
a	1
castle,	1
he	1
advanced,	1
and	1
at	1
a	1
short	1
distance	1
from	1
it	1
he	1
checked	1
Rocinante,	1
hoping	1
that	1
some	1
dwarf	1
would	1
show	1
himself	1
upon	1
the	1
battlements,	1
and	1
by	1
sound	1
of	1
trumpet	1
give	1
notice	1
that	1
a	1
knight	1
was	1
approaching	1
the	1
castle.	1
But	1
seeing	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
slow	1
about	1
it,	1
and	1
that	1
Rocinante	1
was	1
in	1
a	1
hurry	1
to	1
reach	1
the	1
stable,	1
he	1
made	1
for	1
the	1
inn	1
door,	1
and	1
perceived	1
the	1
two	1
gay	1
damsels	1
who	1
were	1
standing	1
there,	1
and	1
who	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
two	1
fair	1
maidens	1
or	1
lovely	1
ladies	1
taking	1
their	1
ease	1
at	1
the	1
castle	1
gate.	1
At	1
this	1
moment	1
it	1
so	1
happened	1
that	1
a	1
swineherd	1
who	1
was	1
going	1
through	1
the	1
stubbles	1
collecting	1
a	1
drove	1
of	1
pigs	1
(for,	1
without	1
any	1
apology,	1
that	1
is	1
what	1
they	1
are	1
called)	1
gave	1
a	1
blast	1
of	1
his	1
horn	1
to	1
bring	1
them	1
together,	1
and	1
forthwith	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
to	1
be	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
expecting,	1
the	1
signal	1
of	1
some	1
dwarf	1
announcing	1
his	1
arrival;	1
and	1
so	1
with	1
prodigious	1
satisfaction	1
he	1
rode	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
inn	1
and	1
to	1
the	1
ladies,	1
who,	1
seeing	1
a	1
man	1
of	1
this	1
sort	1
approaching	1
in	1
full	1
armour	1
and	1
with	1
lance	1
and	1
buckler,	1
were	1
turning	1
in	1
dismay	1
into	1
the	1
inn,	1
when	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
guessing	1
their	1
fear	1
by	1
their	1
flight,	1
raising	1
his	1
pasteboard	1
visor,	1
disclosed	1
his	1
dry	1
dusty	1
visage,	1
and	1
with	1
courteous	1
bearing	1
and	1
gentle	1
voice	1
addressed	1
them,	1
“Your	1
ladyships	1
need	1
not	1
fly	1
or	1
fear	1
any	1
rudeness,	1
for	1
that	1
it	1
belongs	1
not	1
to	1
the	1
order	1
of	1
knighthood	1
which	1
I	1
profess	1
to	1
offer	1
to	1
anyone,	1
much	1
less	1
to	1
highborn	1
maidens	1
as	1
your	1
appearance	1
proclaims	1
you	1
to	1
be.”	1
The	1
girls	1
were	1
looking	1
at	1
him	1
and	1
straining	1
their	1
eyes	1
to	1
make	1
out	1
the	1
features	1
which	1
the	1
clumsy	1
visor	1
obscured,	1
but	1
when	1
they	1
heard	1
themselves	1
called	1
maidens,	1
a	1
thing	1
so	1
much	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
line,	1
they	1
could	1
not	1
restrain	1
their	1
laughter,	1
which	1
made	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
wax	1
indignant,	1
and	1
say,	1
“Modesty	1
becomes	1
the	1
fair,	1
and	1
moreover	1
laughter	1
that	1
has	1
little	1
cause	1
is	1
great	1
silliness;	1
this,	1
however,	1
I	1
say	1
not	1
to	1
pain	1
or	1
anger	1
you,	1
for	1
my	1
desire	1
is	1
none	1
other	1
than	1
to	1
serve	1
you.”	1
The	1
incomprehensible	1
language	1
and	1
the	1
unpromising	1
looks	1
of	1
our	1
cavalier	1
only	1
increased	1
the	1
ladies’	1
laughter,	1
and	1
that	1
increased	1
his	1
irritation,	1
and	1
matters	1
might	1
have	1
gone	1
farther	1
if	1
at	1
that	1
moment	1
the	1
landlord	1
had	1
not	1
come	1
out,	1
who,	1
being	1
a	1
very	1
fat	1
man,	1
was	1
a	1
very	1
peaceful	1
one.	1
He,	1
seeing	1
this	1
grotesque	1
figure	1
clad	1
in	1
armour	1
that	1
did	1
not	1
match	1
any	1
more	1
than	1
his	1
saddle,	1
bridle,	1
lance,	1
buckler,	1
or	1
corselet,	1
was	1
not	1
at	1
all	1
indisposed	1
to	1
join	1
the	1
damsels	1
in	1
their	1
manifestations	1
of	1
amusement;	1
but,	1
in	1
truth,	1
standing	1
in	1
awe	1
of	1
such	1
a	1
complicated	1
armament,	1
he	1
thought	1
it	1
best	1
to	1
speak	1
him	1
fairly,	1
so	1
he	1
said,	1
“Señor	1
Caballero,	1
if	1
your	1
worship	1
wants	1
lodging,	1
bating	1
the	1
bed	1
(for	1
there	1
is	1
not	1
one	1
in	1
the	1
inn)	1
there	1
is	1
plenty	1
of	1
everything	1
else	1
here.”	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
observing	1
the	1
respectful	1
bearing	1
of	1
the	1
Alcaide	1
of	1
the	1
fortress	1
(for	1
so	1
innkeeper	1
and	1
inn	1
seemed	1
in	1
his	1
eyes),	1
made	1
answer,	1
“Sir	1
Castellan,	1
for	1
me	1
anything	1
will	1
suffice,	1
for	1
‘My	1
armour	1
is	1
my	1
only	1
wear,	1
My	1
only	1
rest	1
the	1
fray.’”	1
The	1
host	1
fancied	1
he	1
called	1
him	1
Castellan	1
because	1
he	1
took	1
him	1
for	1
a	1
“worthy	1
of	1
Castile,”	1
though	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
fact	1
an	1
Andalusian,	1
and	1
one	1
from	1
the	1
strand	1
of	1
San	1
Lucar,	1
as	1
crafty	1
a	1
thief	1
as	1
Cacus	1
and	1
as	1
full	1
of	1
tricks	1
as	1
a	1
student	1
or	1
a	1
page.	1
“In	1
that	1
case,”	1
said	1
he,	1
“‘Your	1
bed	1
is	1
on	1
the	1
flinty	1
rock,	1
Your	1
sleep	1
to	1
watch	1
alway;’	1
and	1
if	1
so,	1
you	1
may	1
dismount	1
and	1
safely	1
reckon	1
upon	1
any	1
quantity	1
of	1
sleeplessness	1
under	1
this	1
roof	1
for	1
a	1
twelvemonth,	1
not	1
to	1
say	1
for	1
a	1
single	1
night.”	1
So	1
saying,	1
he	1
advanced	1
to	1
hold	1
the	1
stirrup	1
for	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
who	1
got	1
down	1
with	1
great	1
difficulty	1
and	1
exertion	1
(for	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
broken	1
his	1
fast	1
all	1
day),	1
and	1
then	1
charged	1
the	1
host	1
to	1
take	1
great	1
care	1
of	1
his	1
horse,	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
the	1
best	1
bit	1
of	1
flesh	1
that	1
ever	1
ate	1
bread	1
in	1
this	1
world.	1
The	1
landlord	1
eyed	1
him	1
over	1
but	1
did	1
not	1
find	1
him	1
as	1
good	1
as	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
said,	1
nor	1
even	1
half	1
as	1
good;	1
and	1
putting	1
him	1
up	1
in	1
the	1
stable,	1
he	1
returned	1
to	1
see	1
what	1
might	1
be	1
wanted	1
by	1
his	1
guest,	1
whom	1
the	1
damsels,	1
who	1
had	1
by	1
this	1
time	1
made	1
their	1
peace	1
with	1
him,	1
were	1
now	1
relieving	1
of	1
his	1
armour.	1
They	1
had	1
taken	1
off	1
his	1
breastplate	1
and	1
backpiece,	1
but	1
they	1
neither	1
knew	1
nor	1
saw	1
how	1
to	1
open	1
his	1
gorget	1
or	1
remove	1
his	1
make-shift	1
helmet,	1
for	1
he	1
had	1
fastened	1
it	1
with	1
green	1
ribbons,	1
which,	1
as	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
untying	1
the	1
knots,	1
required	1
to	1
be	1
cut.	1
This,	1
however,	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
by	1
any	1
means	1
consent	1
to,	1
so	1
he	1
remained	1
all	1
the	1
evening	1
with	1
his	1
helmet	1
on,	1
the	1
drollest	1
and	1
oddest	1
figure	1
that	1
can	1
be	1
imagined;	1
and	1
while	1
they	1
were	1
removing	1
his	1
armour,	1
taking	1
the	1
baggages	1
who	1
were	1
about	1
it	1
for	1
ladies	1
of	1
high	1
degree	1
belonging	1
to	1
the	1
castle,	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
them	1
with	1
great	1
sprightliness:	1
“Oh,	1
never,	1
surely,	1
was	1
there	1
knight	1
So	1
served	1
by	1
hand	1
of	1
dame,	1
As	1
served	1
was	1
he,	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
hight,	1
When	1
from	1
his	1
town	1
he	1
came;	1
With	1
maidens	1
waiting	1
on	1
himself,	1
Princesses	1
on	1
his	1
hack—	1
—or	1
Rocinante,	1
for	1
that,	1
ladies	1
mine,	1
is	1
my	1
horse’s	1
name,	1
and	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
of	1
La	1
Mancha	1
is	1
my	1
own;	1
for	1
though	1
I	1
had	1
no	1
intention	1
of	1
declaring	1
myself	1
until	1
my	1
achievements	1
in	1
your	1
service	1
and	1
honour	1
had	1
made	1
me	1
known,	1
the	1
necessity	1
of	1
adapting	1
that	1
old	1
ballad	1
of	1
Lancelot	1
to	1
the	1
present	1
occasion	1
has	1
given	1
you	1
the	1
knowledge	1
of	1
my	1
name	1
altogether	1
prematurely.	1
A	1
time,	1
however,	1
will	1
come	1
for	1
your	1
ladyships	1
to	1
command	1
and	1
me	1
to	1
obey,	1
and	1
then	1
the	1
might	1
of	1
my	1
arm	1
will	1
show	1
my	1
desire	1
to	1
serve	1
you.”	1
The	1
girls,	1
who	1
were	1
not	1
used	1
to	1
hearing	1
rhetoric	1
of	1
this	1
sort,	1
had	1
nothing	1
to	1
say	1
in	1
reply;	1
they	1
only	1
asked	1
him	1
if	1
he	1
wanted	1
anything	1
to	1
eat.	1
“I	1
would	1
gladly	1
eat	1
a	1
bit	1
of	1
something,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“for	1
I	1
feel	1
it	1
would	1
come	1
very	1
seasonably.”	1
The	1
day	1
happened	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
Friday,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
whole	1
inn	1
there	1
was	1
nothing	1
but	1
some	1
pieces	1
of	1
the	1
fish	1
they	1
call	1
in	1
Castile	1
“abadejo,”	1
in	1
Andalusia	1
“bacallao,”	1
and	1
in	1
some	1
places	1
“curadillo,”	1
and	1
in	1
others	1
“troutlet;”	1
so	1
they	1
asked	1
him	1
if	1
he	1
thought	1
he	1
could	1
eat	1
troutlet,	1
for	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
other	1
fish	1
to	1
give	1
him.	1
“If	1
there	1
be	1
troutlets	1
enough,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“they	1
will	1
be	1
the	1
same	1
thing	1
as	1
a	1
trout;	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
all	1
one	1
to	1
me	1
whether	1
I	1
am	1
given	1
eight	1
reals	1
in	1
small	1
change	1
or	1
a	1
piece	1
of	1
eight;	1
moreover,	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
that	1
these	1
troutlets	1
are	1
like	1
veal,	1
which	1
is	1
better	1
than	1
beef,	1
or	1
kid,	1
which	1
is	1
better	1
than	1
goat.	1
But	1
whatever	1
it	1
be	1
let	1
it	1
come	1
quickly,	1
for	1
the	1
burden	1
and	1
pressure	1
of	1
arms	1
cannot	1
be	1
borne	1
without	1
support	1
to	1
the	1
inside.”	1
They	1
laid	1
a	1
table	1
for	1
him	1
at	1
the	1
door	1
of	1
the	1
inn	1
for	1
the	1
sake	1
of	1
the	1
air,	1
and	1
the	1
host	1
brought	1
him	1
a	1
portion	1
of	1
ill-soaked	1
and	1
worse	1
cooked	1
stockfish,	1
and	1
a	1
piece	1
of	1
bread	1
as	1
black	1
and	1
mouldy	1
as	1
his	1
own	1
armour;	1
but	1
a	1
laughable	1
sight	1
it	1
was	1
to	1
see	1
him	1
eating,	1
for	1
having	1
his	1
helmet	1
on	1
and	1
the	1
beaver	1
up,	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
with	1
his	1
own	1
hands	1
put	1
anything	1
into	1
his	1
mouth	1
unless	1
someone	1
else	1
placed	1
it	1
there,	1
and	1
this	1
service	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
ladies	1
rendered	1
him.	1
But	1
to	1
give	1
him	1
anything	1
to	1
drink	1
was	1
impossible,	1
or	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
so	1
had	1
not	1
the	1
landlord	1
bored	1
a	1
reed,	1
and	1
putting	1
one	1
end	1
in	1
his	1
mouth	1
poured	1
the	1
wine	1
into	1
him	1
through	1
the	1
other;	1
all	1
which	1
he	1
bore	1
with	1
patience	1
rather	1
than	1
sever	1
the	1
ribbons	1
of	1
his	1
helmet.	1
While	1
this	1
was	1
going	1
on	1
there	1
came	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
inn	1
a	1
sowgelder,	1
who,	1
as	1
he	1
approached,	1
sounded	1
his	1
reed	1
pipe	1
four	1
or	1
five	1
times,	1
and	1
thereby	1
completely	1
convinced	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
some	1
famous	1
castle,	1
and	1
that	1
they	1
were	1
regaling	1
him	1
with	1
music,	1
and	1
that	1
the	1
stockfish	1
was	1
trout,	1
the	1
bread	1
the	1
whitest,	1
the	1
wenches	1
ladies,	1
and	1
the	1
landlord	1
the	1
castellan	1
of	1
the	1
castle;	1
and	1
consequently	1
he	1
held	1
that	1
his	1
enterprise	1
and	1
sally	1
had	1
been	1
to	1
some	1
purpose.	1
But	1
still	1
it	1
distressed	1
him	1
to	1
think	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
been	1
dubbed	1
a	1
knight,	1
for	1
it	1
was	1
plain	1
to	1
him	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
lawfully	1
engage	1
in	1
any	1
adventure	1
without	1
receiving	1
the	1
order	1
of	1
knighthood.	1

HAD	1
HIMSELF	1
DUBBED	1
A	1
KNIGHT	1
p009.jpg	1
(164K)	1
Full	1
Size	1
Harassed	1
by	1
this	1
reflection,	1
he	1
made	1
haste	1
with	1
his	1
scanty	1
pothouse	1
supper,	1
and	1
having	1
finished	1
it	1
called	1
the	1
landlord,	1
and	1
shutting	1
himself	1
into	1
the	1
stable	1
with	1
him,	1
fell	1
on	1
his	1
knees	1
before	1
him,	1
saying,	1
“From	1
this	1
spot	1
I	1
rise	1
not,	1
valiant	1
knight,	1
until	1
your	1
courtesy	1
grants	1
me	1
the	1
boon	1
I	1
seek,	1
one	1
that	1
will	1
redound	1
to	1
your	1
praise	1
and	1
the	1
benefit	1
of	1
the	1
human	1
race.”	1
The	1
landlord,	1
seeing	1
his	1
guest	1
at	1
his	1
feet	1
and	1
hearing	1
a	1
speech	1
of	1
this	1
kind,	1
stood	1
staring	1
at	1
him	1
in	1
bewilderment,	1
not	1
knowing	1
what	1
to	1
do	1
or	1
say,	1
and	1
entreating	1
him	1
to	1
rise,	1
but	1
all	1
to	1
no	1
purpose	1
until	1
he	1
had	1
agreed	1
to	1
grant	1
the	1
boon	1
demanded	1
of	1
him.	1
“I	1
looked	1
for	1
no	1
less,	1
my	1
lord,	1
from	1
your	1
High	1
Magnificence,”	1
replied	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“and	1
I	1
have	1
to	1
tell	1
you	1
that	1
the	1
boon	1
I	1
have	1
asked	1
and	1
your	1
liberality	1
has	1
granted	1
is	1
that	1
you	1
shall	1
dub	1
me	1
knight	1
to-morrow	1
morning,	1
and	1
that	1
to-night	1
I	1
shall	1
watch	1
my	1
arms	1
in	1
the	1
chapel	1
of	1
this	1
your	1
castle;	1
thus	1
to-morrow,	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
said,	1
will	1
be	1
accomplished	1
what	1
I	1
so	1
much	1
desire,	1
enabling	1
me	1
lawfully	1
to	1
roam	1
through	1
all	1
the	1
four	1
quarters	1
of	1
the	1
world	1
seeking	1
adventures	1
on	1
behalf	1
of	1
those	1
in	1
distress,	1
as	1
is	1
the	1
duty	1
of	1
chivalry	1
and	1
of	1
knights-errant	1
like	1
myself,	1
whose	1
ambition	1
is	1
directed	1
to	1
such	1
deeds.”	1
The	1
landlord,	1
who,	1
as	1
has	1
been	1
mentioned,	1
was	1
something	1
of	1
a	1
wag,	1
and	1
had	1
already	1
some	1
suspicion	1
of	1
his	1
guest’s	1
want	1
of	1
wits,	1
was	1
quite	1
convinced	1
of	1
it	1
on	1
hearing	1
talk	1
of	1
this	1
kind	1
from	1
him,	1
and	1
to	1
make	1
sport	1
for	1
the	1
night	1
he	1
determined	1
to	1
fall	1
in	1
with	1
his	1
humour.	1
So	1
he	1
told	1
him	1
he	1
was	1
quite	1
right	1
in	1
pursuing	1
the	1
object	1
he	1
had	1
in	1
view,	1
and	1
that	1
such	1
a	1
motive	1
was	1
natural	1
and	1
becoming	1
in	1
cavaliers	1
as	1
distinguished	1
as	1
he	1
seemed	1
and	1
his	1
gallant	1
bearing	1
showed	1
him	1
to	1
be;	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
himself	1
in	1
his	1
younger	1
days	1
had	1
followed	1
the	1
same	1
honourable	1
calling,	1
roaming	1
in	1
quest	1
of	1
adventures	1
in	1
various	1
parts	1
of	1
the	1
world,	1
among	1
others	1
the	1
Curing-grounds	1
of	1
Malaga,	1
the	1
Isles	1
of	1
Riaran,	1
the	1
Precinct	1
of	1
Seville,	1
the	1
Little	1
Market	1
of	1

Olivera	1
of	1

quarters,	1
where	1
he	1
had	1
proved	1
the	1
nimbleness	1
of	1
his	1
feet	1
and	1
the	1
lightness	1
of	1
his	1
fingers,	1
doing	1
many	1
wrongs,	1
cheating	1
many	1
widows,	1
ruining	1
maids	1
and	1
swindling	1
minors,	1
and,	1
in	1
short,	1
bringing	1
himself	1
under	1
the	1
notice	1
of	1
almost	1
every	1
tribunal	1
and	1
court	1
of	1
justice	1
in	1
Spain;	1
until	1
at	1
last	1
he	1
had	1
retired	1
to	1
this	1
castle	1
of	1
his,	1
where	1
he	1
was	1
living	1
upon	1
his	1
property	1
and	1
upon	1
that	1
of	1
others;	1
and	1
where	1
he	1
received	1
all	1
knights-errant	1
of	1
whatever	1
rank	1
or	1
condition	1
they	1
might	1
be,	1
all	1
for	1
the	1
great	1
love	1
he	1
bore	1
them	1
and	1
that	1
they	1
might	1
share	1
their	1
substance	1
with	1
him	1
in	1
return	1
for	1
his	1
benevolence.	1
He	1
told	1
him,	1
moreover,	1
that	1
in	1
this	1
castle	1
of	1
his	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
chapel	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
could	1
watch	1
his	1
armour,	1
as	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
pulled	1
down	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
be	1
rebuilt,	1
but	1
that	1
in	1
a	1
case	1
of	1
necessity	1
it	1
might,	1
he	1
knew,	1
be	1
watched	1
anywhere,	1
and	1
he	1
might	1
watch	1
it	1
that	1
night	1
in	1
a	1
courtyard	1
of	1
the	1
castle,	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
morning,	1
God	1
willing,	1
the	1
requisite	1
ceremonies	1
might	1
be	1
performed	1
so	1
as	1
to	1
have	1
him	1
dubbed	1
a	1
knight,	1
and	1
so	1
thoroughly	1
dubbed	1
that	1
nobody	1
could	1
be	1
more	1
so.	1
He	1
asked	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
any	1
money	1
with	1
him,	1
to	1
which	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
replied	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
a	1
farthing,	1
as	1
in	1
the	1
histories	1
of	1
knights-errant	1
he	1
had	1
never	1
read	1
of	1
any	1
of	1
them	1
carrying	1
any.	1
On	1
this	1
point	1
the	1
landlord	1
told	1
him	1
he	1
was	1
mistaken;	1
for,	1
though	1
not	1
recorded	1
in	1
the	1
histories,	1
because	1
in	1
the	1
author’s	1
opinion	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
need	1
to	1
mention	1
anything	1
so	1
obvious	1
and	1
necessary	1
as	1
money	1
and	1
clean	1
shirts,	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
to	1
be	1
supposed	1
therefore	1
that	1
they	1
did	1
not	1
carry	1
them,	1
and	1
he	1
might	1
regard	1
it	1
as	1
certain	1
and	1
established	1
that	1
all	1
knights-errant	1
(about	1
whom	1
there	1
were	1
so	1
many	1
full	1
and	1
unimpeachable	1
books)	1
carried	1
well-furnished	1
purses	1
in	1
case	1
of	1
emergency,	1
and	1
likewise	1
carried	1
shirts	1
and	1
a	1
little	1
box	1
of	1
ointment	1
to	1
cure	1
the	1
wounds	1
they	1
received.	1
For	1
in	1
those	1
plains	1
and	1
deserts	1
where	1
they	1
engaged	1
in	1
combat	1
and	1
came	1
out	1
wounded,	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
always	1
that	1
there	1
was	1
someone	1
to	1
cure	1
them,	1
unless	1
indeed	1
they	1
had	1
for	1
a	1
friend	1
some	1
sage	1
magician	1
to	1
succour	1
them	1
at	1
once	1
by	1
fetching	1
through	1
the	1
air	1
upon	1
a	1
cloud	1
some	1
damsel	1
or	1
dwarf	1
with	1
a	1
vial	1
of	1
water	1
of	1
such	1
virtue	1
that	1
by	1
tasting	1
one	1
drop	1
of	1
it	1
they	1
were	1
cured	1
of	1
their	1
hurts	1
and	1
wounds	1
in	1
an	1
instant	1
and	1
left	1
as	1
sound	1
as	1
if	1
they	1
had	1
not	1
received	1
any	1
damage	1
whatever.	1
But	1
in	1
case	1
this	1
should	1
not	1
occur,	1
the	1
knights	1
of	1
old	1
took	1
care	1
to	1
see	1
that	1
their	1
squires	1
were	1
provided	1
with	1
money	1
and	1
other	1
requisites,	1
such	1
as	1
lint	1
and	1
ointments	1
for	1
healing	1
purposes;	1
and	1
when	1
it	1
happened	1
that	1
knights	1
had	1
no	1
squires	1
(which	1
was	1
rarely	1
and	1
seldom	1
the	1
case)	1
they	1
themselves	1
carried	1
everything	1
in	1
cunning	1
saddle-bags	1
that	1
were	1
hardly	1
seen	1
on	1
the	1
horse’s	1
croup,	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
were	1
something	1
else	1
of	1
more	1
importance,	1
because,	1
unless	1
for	1
some	1
such	1
reason,	1
carrying	1
saddle-bags	1
was	1
not	1
very	1
favourably	1
regarded	1
among	1
knights-errant.	1
He	1
therefore	1
advised	1
him	1
(and,	1
as	1
his	1
godson	1
so	1
soon	1
to	1
be,	1
he	1
might	1
even	1
command	1
him)	1
never	1
from	1
that	1
time	1
forth	1
to	1
travel	1
without	1
money	1
and	1
the	1
usual	1
requirements,	1
and	1
he	1
would	1
find	1
the	1
advantage	1
of	1
them	1
when	1
he	1
least	1
expected	1
it.	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
promised	1
to	1
follow	1
his	1
advice	1
scrupulously,	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
arranged	1
forthwith	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
watch	1
his	1
armour	1
in	1
a	1
large	1
yard	1
at	1
one	1
side	1
of	1
the	1
inn;	1
so,	1
collecting	1
it	1
all	1
together,	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
placed	1
it	1
on	1
a	1
trough	1
that	1
stood	1
by	1
the	1
side	1
of	1
a	1
well,	1
and	1
bracing	1
his	1
buckler	1
on	1
his	1
arm	1
he	1
grasped	1
his	1
lance	1
and	1
began	1
with	1
a	1
stately	1
air	1
to	1
march	1
up	1
and	1
down	1
in	1
front	1
of	1
the	1
trough,	1
and	1
as	1
he	1
began	1
his	1
march	1
night	1
began	1
to	1
fall.	1
The	1
landlord	1
told	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
who	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
inn	1
about	1
the	1
craze	1
of	1
his	1
guest,	1
the	1
watching	1
of	1
the	1
armour,	1
and	1
the	1
dubbing	1
ceremony	1
he	1
contemplated.	1
Full	1
of	1
wonder	1
at	1
so	1
strange	1
a	1
form	1
of	1
madness,	1
they	1
flocked	1
to	1
see	1
it	1
from	1
a	1
distance,	1
and	1
observed	1
with	1
what	1
composure	1
he	1
sometimes	1
paced	1
up	1
and	1
down,	1
or	1
sometimes,	1
leaning	1
on	1
his	1
lance,	1
gazed	1
on	1
his	1
armour	1
without	1
taking	1
his	1
eyes	1
off	1
it	1
for	1
ever	1
so	1
long;	1
and	1
as	1
the	1
night	1
closed	1
in	1
with	1
a	1
light	1
from	1
the	1
moon	1
so	1
brilliant	1
that	1
it	1
might	1
vie	1
with	1
his	1
that	1
lent	1
it,	1
everything	1
the	1
novice	1
knight	1
did	1
was	1
plainly	1
seen	1
by	1
all.	1
Meanwhile	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
carriers	1
who	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
inn	1
thought	1
fit	1
to	1
water	1
his	1
team,	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
necessary	1
to	1
remove	1
Don	1
Quixote’s	1
armour	1
as	1
it	1
lay	1
on	1
the	1
trough;	1
but	1
he	1
seeing	1
the	1
other	1
approach	1
hailed	1
him	1
in	1
a	1
loud	1
voice,	1
“O	1
thou,	1
whoever	1
thou	1
art,	1
rash	1
knight	1
that	1
comest	1
to	1
lay	1
hands	1
on	1
the	1
armour	1
of	1
the	1
most	1
valorous	1
errant	1
that	1
ever	1
girt	1
on	1
sword,	1
have	1
a	1
care	1
what	1
thou	1
dost;	1
touch	1
it	1
not	1
unless	1
thou	1
wouldst	1
lay	1
down	1
thy	1
life	1
as	1
the	1
penalty	1
of	1
thy	1
rashness.”	1
The	1
carrier	1
gave	1
no	1
heed	1
to	1
these	1
words	1
(and	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
done	1
better	1
to	1
heed	1
them	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
heedful	1
of	1
his	1
health),	1
but	1
seizing	1
it	1
by	1
the	1
straps	1
flung	1
the	1
armour	1
some	1
distance	1
from	1
him.	1
Seeing	1
this,	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
raised	1
his	1
eyes	1
to	1
heaven,	1
and	1
fixing	1
his	1
thoughts,	1
apparently,	1
upon	1
his	1
lady	1
Dulcinea,	1
exclaimed,	1
“Aid	1
me,	1
lady	1
mine,	1
in	1
this	1
the	1
first	1
encounter	1
that	1
presents	1
itself	1
to	1
this	1
breast	1
which	1
thou	1
holdest	1
in	1
subjection;	1
let	1
not	1
thy	1
favour	1
and	1
protection	1
fail	1
me	1
in	1
this	1
first	1
jeopardy;”	1
and,	1
with	1
these	1
words	1
and	1
others	1
to	1
the	1
same	1
purpose,	1
dropping	1
his	1
buckler	1
he	1
lifted	1
his	1
lance	1
with	1
both	1
hands	1
and	1
with	1
it	1
smote	1
such	1
a	1
blow	1
on	1
the	1
carrier’s	1
head	1
that	1
he	1
stretched	1
him	1
on	1
the	1
ground,	1
so	1
stunned	1
that	1
had	1
he	1
followed	1
it	1
up	1
with	1
a	1
second	1
there	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
no	1
need	1
of	1
a	1
surgeon	1
to	1
cure	1
him.	1
This	1
done,	1
he	1
picked	1
up	1
his	1
armour	1
and	1
returned	1
to	1
his	1
beat	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
serenity	1
as	1
before.	1

Shortly	1
after	1
this,	1
another,	1
not	1
knowing	1
what	1
had	1
happened	1
(for	1
the	1
carrier	1
still	1
lay	1
senseless),	1
came	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
object	1
of	1
giving	1
water	1
to	1
his	1
mules,	1
and	1
was	1
proceeding	1
to	1
remove	1
the	1
armour	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
clear	1
the	1
trough,	1
when	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
without	1
uttering	1
a	1
word	1
or	1
imploring	1
aid	1
from	1
anyone,	1
once	1
more	1
dropped	1
his	1
buckler	1
and	1
once	1
more	1
lifted	1
his	1
lance,	1
and	1
without	1
actually	1
breaking	1
the	1
second	1
carrier’s	1
head	1
into	1
pieces,	1
made	1
more	1
than	1
three	1
of	1
it,	1
for	1
he	1
laid	1
it	1
open	1
in	1
four.	1
At	1
the	1
noise	1
all	1
the	1
people	1
of	1
the	1
inn	1
ran	1
to	1
the	1
spot,	1
and	1
among	1
them	1
the	1
landlord.	1
Seeing	1
this,	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
braced	1
his	1
buckler	1
on	1
his	1
arm,	1
and	1
with	1
his	1
hand	1
on	1
his	1
sword	1
exclaimed,	1
“O	1
Lady	1
of	1
Beauty,	1
strength	1
and	1
support	1
of	1
my	1
faint	1
heart,	1
it	1
is	1
time	1
for	1
thee	1
to	1
turn	1
the	1
eyes	1
of	1
thy	1
greatness	1
on	1
this	1
thy	1
captive	1
knight	1
on	1
the	1
brink	1
of	1
so	1
mighty	1
an	1
adventure.”	1
By	1
this	1
he	1
felt	1
himself	1
so	1
inspired	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
flinched	1
if	1
all	1
the	1
carriers	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
had	1
assailed	1
him.	1
The	1
comrades	1
of	1
the	1
wounded	1
perceiving	1
the	1
plight	1
they	1
were	1
in	1
began	1
from	1
a	1
distance	1
to	1
shower	1
stones	1
on	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
who	1
screened	1
himself	1
as	1
best	1
he	1
could	1
with	1
his	1
buckler,	1
not	1
daring	1
to	1
quit	1
the	1
trough	1
and	1
leave	1
his	1
armour	1
unprotected.	1
The	1
landlord	1
shouted	1
to	1
them	1
to	1
leave	1
him	1
alone,	1
for	1
he	1
had	1
already	1
told	1
them	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
mad,	1
and	1
as	1
a	1
madman	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
be	1
accountable	1
even	1
if	1
he	1
killed	1
them	1
all.	1
Still	1
louder	1
shouted	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
calling	1
them	1
knaves	1
and	1
traitors,	1
and	1
the	1
lord	1
of	1
the	1
castle,	1
who	1
allowed	1
knights-errant	1
to	1
be	1
treated	1
in	1
this	1
fashion,	1
a	1
villain	1
and	1
a	1
low-born	1
knight	1
whom,	1
had	1
he	1
received	1
the	1
order	1
of	1
knighthood,	1
he	1
would	1
call	1
to	1
account	1
for	1
his	1
treachery.	1
“But	1
of	1
you,”	1
he	1
cried,	1
“base	1
and	1
vile	1
rabble,	1
I	1
make	1
no	1
account;	1
fling,	1
strike,	1
come	1
on,	1
do	1
all	1
ye	1
can	1
against	1
me,	1
ye	1
shall	1
see	1
what	1
the	1
reward	1
of	1
your	1
folly	1
and	1
insolence	1
will	1
be.”	1
This	1
he	1
uttered	1
with	1
so	1
much	1
spirit	1
and	1
boldness	1
that	1
he	1
filled	1
his	1
assailants	1
with	1
a	1
terrible	1
fear,	1
and	1
as	1
much	1
for	1
this	1
reason	1
as	1
at	1
the	1
persuasion	1
of	1
the	1
landlord	1
they	1
left	1
off	1
stoning	1
him,	1
and	1
he	1
allowed	1
them	1
to	1
carry	1
off	1
the	1
wounded,	1
and	1
with	1
the	1
same	1
calmness	1
and	1
composure	1
as	1
before	1
resumed	1
the	1
watch	1
over	1
his	1
armour.	1
But	1
these	1
freaks	1
of	1
his	1
guest	1
were	1
not	1
much	1
to	1
the	1
liking	1
of	1
the	1
landlord,	1
so	1
he	1
determined	1
to	1
cut	1
matters	1
short	1
and	1
confer	1
upon	1
him	1
at	1
once	1
the	1
unlucky	1
order	1
of	1
knighthood	1
before	1
any	1
further	1
misadventure	1
could	1
occur;	1
so,	1
going	1
up	1
to	1
him,	1
he	1
apologised	1
for	1
the	1
rudeness	1
which,	1
without	1
his	1
knowledge,	1
had	1
been	1
offered	1
to	1
him	1
by	1
these	1
low	1
people,	1
who,	1
however,	1
had	1
been	1
well	1
punished	1
for	1
their	1
audacity.	1
As	1
he	1
had	1
already	1
told	1
him,	1
he	1
said,	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
chapel	1
in	1
the	1
castle,	1
nor	1
was	1
it	1
needed	1
for	1
what	1
remained	1
to	1
be	1
done,	1
for,	1
as	1
he	1
understood	1
the	1
ceremonial	1
of	1
the	1
order,	1
the	1
whole	1
point	1
of	1
being	1
dubbed	1
a	1
knight	1
lay	1
in	1
the	1
accolade	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
slap	1
on	1
the	1
shoulder,	1
and	1
that	1
could	1
be	1
administered	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
a	1
field;	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
now	1
done	1
all	1
that	1
was	1
needful	1
as	1
to	1
watching	1
the	1
armour,	1
for	1
all	1
requirements	1
were	1
satisfied	1
by	1
a	1
watch	1
of	1
two	1
hours	1
only,	1
while	1
he	1
had	1
been	1
more	1
than	1
four	1
about	1
it.	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
believed	1
it	1
all,	1
and	1
told	1
him	1
he	1
stood	1
there	1
ready	1
to	1
obey	1
him,	1
and	1
to	1
make	1
an	1
end	1
of	1
it	1
with	1
as	1
much	1
despatch	1
as	1
possible;	1
for,	1
if	1
he	1
were	1
again	1
attacked,	1
and	1
felt	1
himself	1
to	1
be	1
dubbed	1
knight,	1
he	1
would	1
not,	1
he	1
thought,	1
leave	1
a	1
soul	1
alive	1
in	1
the	1
castle,	1
except	1
such	1
as	1
out	1
of	1
respect	1
he	1
might	1
spare	1
at	1
his	1
bidding.	1
Thus	1
warned	1
and	1
menaced,	1
the	1
castellan	1
forthwith	1
brought	1
out	1
a	1
book	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
used	1
to	1
enter	1
the	1
straw	1
and	1
barley	1
he	1
served	1
out	1
to	1
the	1
carriers,	1
and,	1
with	1
a	1
lad	1
carrying	1
a	1
candle-end,	1
and	1
the	1
two	1
damsels	1
already	1
mentioned,	1
he	1
returned	1
to	1
where	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
stood,	1
and	1
bade	1
him	1
kneel	1
down.	1
Then,	1
reading	1
from	1
his	1
account-book	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
were	1
repeating	1
some	1
devout	1
prayer,	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
his	1
delivery	1
he	1
raised	1
his	1
hand	1
and	1
gave	1
him	1
a	1
sturdy	1
blow	1
on	1
the	1
neck,	1
and	1
then,	1
with	1
his	1
own	1
sword,	1
a	1
smart	1
slap	1
on	1
the	1
shoulder,	1
all	1
the	1
while	1
muttering	1
between	1
his	1
teeth	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
was	1
saying	1
his	1
prayers.	1
Having	1
done	1
this,	1
he	1
directed	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
ladies	1
to	1
gird	1
on	1
his	1
sword,	1
which	1
she	1
did	1
with	1
great	1
self-possession	1
and	1
gravity,	1
and	1
not	1
a	1
little	1
was	1
required	1
to	1
prevent	1
a	1
burst	1
of	1
laughter	1
at	1
each	1
stage	1
of	1
the	1
ceremony;	1
but	1
what	1
they	1
had	1
already	1
seen	1
of	1
the	1
novice	1
knight’s	1
prowess	1
kept	1
their	1
laughter	1
within	1
bounds.	1
On	1
girding	1
him	1
with	1
the	1
sword	1
the	1
worthy	1
lady	1
said	1
to	1
him,	1
“May	1
God	1
make	1
your	1
worship	1
a	1
very	1
fortunate	1
knight,	1
and	1
grant	1
you	1
success	1
in	1
battle.”	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
asked	1
her	1
name	1
in	1
order	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
from	1
that	1
time	1
forward	1
know	1
to	1
whom	1
he	1
was	1
beholden	1
for	1
the	1
favour	1
he	1
had	1
received,	1
as	1
he	1
meant	1
to	1
confer	1
upon	1
her	1
some	1
portion	1
of	1
the	1
honour	1
he	1
acquired	1
by	1
the	1
might	1
of	1
his	1
arm.	1
She	1
answered	1
with	1
great	1
humility	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
called	1
La	1
Tolosa,	1
and	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
a	1
cobbler	1
of	1
Toledo	1
who	1
lived	1
in	1
the	1
stalls	1
of	1
Sanchobienaya,	1
and	1
that	1
wherever	1
she	1
might	1
be	1
she	1
would	1
serve	1
and	1
esteem	1
him	1
as	1
her	1
lord.	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
said	1
in	1
reply	1
that	1
she	1
would	1
do	1
him	1
a	1
favour	1
if	1
thenceforward	1
she	1
assumed	1
the	1
“Don”	1
and	1
called	1
herself	1
Doña	1
Tolosa.	1
She	1
promised	1
she	1
would,	1
and	1
then	1
the	1
other	1
buckled	1
on	1
his	1
spur,	1
and	1
with	1
her	1
followed	1
almost	1
the	1
same	1
conversation	1
as	1
with	1
the	1
lady	1
of	1
the	1
sword.	1
He	1
asked	1
her	1
name,	1
and	1
she	1
said	1
it	1
was	1
La	1
Molinera,	1
and	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
the	1
daughter	1
of	1
a	1
respectable	1
miller	1
of	1
Antequera;	1
and	1
of	1
her	1
likewise	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
requested	1
that	1
she	1
would	1
adopt	1
the	1
“Don”	1
and	1
call	1
herself	1
Doña	1
Molinera,	1
making	1
offers	1
to	1
her	1
further	1
services	1
and	1
favours.	1
Having	1
thus,	1
with	1
hot	1
haste	1
and	1
speed,	1
brought	1
to	1
a	1
conclusion	1
these	1
never-till-now-seen	1
ceremonies,	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
was	1
on	1
thorns	1
until	1
he	1
saw	1
himself	1
on	1
horseback	1
sallying	1
forth	1
in	1
quest	1
of	1
adventures;	1
and	1
saddling	1
Rocinante	1
at	1
once	1
he	1
mounted,	1
and	1
embracing	1
his	1
host,	1
as	1
he	1
returned	1
thanks	1
for	1
his	1
kindness	1
in	1
knighting	1
him,	1
he	1
addressed	1
him	1
in	1
language	1
so	1
extraordinary	1
that	1
it	1
is	1
impossible	1
to	1
convey	1
an	1
idea	1
of	1
it	1
or	1
report	1
it.	1
The	1
landlord,	1
to	1
get	1
him	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
inn,	1
replied	1
with	1
no	1
less	1
rhetoric	1
though	1
with	1
shorter	1
words,	1
and	1
without	1
calling	1
upon	1
him	1
to	1
pay	1
the	1
reckoning	1
let	1
him	1
go	1
with	1
a	1
Godspeed.	1

IV.	1
OF	1
WHAT	1
HAPPENED	1
TO	1
OUR	1
KNIGHT	1
WHEN	1
HE	1
LEFT	1
THE	1

Day	1
was	1
dawning	1
when	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
quitted	1
the	1
inn,	1
so	1
happy,	1
so	1
gay,	1
so	1
exhilarated	1
at	1
finding	1
himself	1
now	1
dubbed	1
a	1
knight,	1
that	1
his	1
joy	1
was	1
like	1
to	1
burst	1
his	1
horse-girths.	1
However,	1
recalling	1
the	1
advice	1
of	1
his	1
host	1
as	1
to	1
the	1
requisites	1
he	1
ought	1
to	1
carry	1
with	1
him,	1
especially	1
that	1
referring	1
to	1
money	1
and	1
shirts,	1
he	1
determined	1
to	1
go	1
home	1
and	1
provide	1
himself	1
with	1
all,	1
and	1
also	1
with	1
a	1
squire,	1
for	1
he	1
reckoned	1
upon	1
securing	1
a	1
farm-labourer,	1
a	1
neighbour	1
of	1
his,	1
a	1
poor	1
man	1
with	1
a	1
family,	1
but	1
very	1
well	1
qualified	1
for	1
the	1
office	1
of	1
squire	1
to	1
a	1
knight.	1
With	1
this	1
object	1
he	1
turned	1
his	1
horse’s	1
head	1
towards	1
his	1
village,	1
and	1
Rocinante,	1
thus	1
reminded	1
of	1
his	1
old	1
quarters,	1
stepped	1
out	1
so	1
briskly	1
that	1
he	1
hardly	1
seemed	1
to	1
tread	1
the	1
earth.	1
He	1
had	1
not	1
gone	1
far,	1
when	1
out	1
of	1
a	1
thicket	1
on	1
his	1
right	1
there	1
seemed	1
to	1
come	1
feeble	1
cries	1
as	1
of	1
someone	1
in	1
distress,	1
and	1
the	1
instant	1
he	1
heard	1
them	1
he	1
exclaimed,	1
“Thanks	1
be	1
to	1
heaven	1
for	1
the	1
favour	1
it	1
accords	1
me,	1
that	1
it	1
so	1
soon	1
offers	1
me	1
an	1
opportunity	1
of	1
fulfilling	1
the	1
obligation	1
I	1
have	1
undertaken,	1
and	1
gathering	1
the	1
fruit	1
of	1
my	1
ambition.	1
These	1
cries,	1
no	1
doubt,	1
come	1
from	1
some	1
man	1
or	1
woman	1
in	1
want	1
of	1
help,	1
and	1
needing	1
my	1
aid	1
and	1
protection;”	1
and	1
wheeling,	1
he	1
turned	1
Rocinante	1
in	1
the	1
direction	1
whence	1
the	1
cries	1
seemed	1
to	1
proceed.	1
He	1
had	1
gone	1
but	1
a	1
few	1
paces	1
into	1
the	1
wood,	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
a	1
mare	1
tied	1
to	1
an	1
oak,	1
and	1
tied	1
to	1
another,	1
and	1
stripped	1
from	1
the	1
waist	1
upwards,	1
a	1
youth	1
of	1
about	1
fifteen	1
years	1
of	1
age,	1
from	1
whom	1
the	1
cries	1
came.	1
Nor	1
were	1
they	1
without	1
cause,	1
for	1
a	1
lusty	1
farmer	1
was	1
flogging	1
him	1
with	1
a	1
belt	1
and	1
following	1
up	1
every	1
blow	1
with	1
scoldings	1
and	1
commands,	1
repeating,	1
“Your	1
mouth	1
shut	1
and	1
your	1
eyes	1
open!”	1
while	1
the	1
youth	1
made	1
answer,	1
“I	1
won’t	1
do	1
it	1
again,	1
master	1
mine;	1
by	1
God’s	1
passion	1
I	1
won’t	1
do	1
it	1
again,	1
and	1
I’ll	1
take	1
more	1
care	1
of	1
the	1
flock	1
another	1
time.”	1
Seeing	1
what	1
was	1
going	1
on,	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
said	1
in	1
an	1
angry	1
voice,	1
“Discourteous	1
knight,	1
it	1
ill	1
becomes	1
you	1
to	1
assail	1
one	1
who	1
cannot	1
defend	1
himself;	1
mount	1
your	1
steed	1
and	1
take	1
your	1
lance”	1
(for	1
there	1
was	1
a	1
lance	1
leaning	1
against	1
the	1
oak	1
to	1
which	1
the	1
mare	1
was	1
tied),	1
“and	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
you	1
know	1
that	1
you	1
are	1
behaving	1
as	1
a	1
coward.”	1
The	1
farmer,	1
seeing	1
before	1
him	1
this	1
figure	1
in	1
full	1
armour	1
brandishing	1
a	1
lance	1
over	1
his	1
head,	1
gave	1
himself	1
up	1
for	1
dead,	1
and	1
made	1
answer	1
meekly,	1
“Sir	1
Knight,	1
this	1
youth	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
chastising	1
is	1
my	1
servant,	1
employed	1
by	1
me	1
to	1
watch	1
a	1
flock	1
of	1
sheep	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
hard	1
by,	1
and	1
he	1
is	1
so	1
careless	1
that	1
I	1
lose	1
one	1
every	1
day,	1
and	1
when	1
I	1
punish	1
him	1
for	1
his	1
carelessness	1
and	1
knavery	1
he	1
says	1
I	1
do	1
it	1
out	1
of	1
niggardliness,	1
to	1
escape	1
paying	1
him	1
the	1
wages	1
I	1
owe	1
him,	1
and	1
before	1
God,	1
and	1
on	1
my	1
soul,	1
he	1
lies.”	1
“Lies	1
before	1
me,	1
base	1
clown!”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote.	1
“By	1
the	1
sun	1
that	1
shines	1
on	1
us	1
I	1
have	1
a	1
mind	1
to	1
run	1
you	1
through	1
with	1
this	1
lance.	1
Pay	1
him	1
at	1
once	1
without	1
another	1
word;	1
if	1
not,	1
by	1
the	1
God	1
that	1
rules	1
us	1
I	1
will	1
make	1
an	1
end	1
of	1
you,	1
and	1
annihilate	1
you	1
on	1
the	1
spot;	1
release	1
him	1
instantly.”	1

The	1
farmer	1
hung	1
his	1
head,	1
and	1
without	1
a	1
word	1
untied	1
his	1
servant,	1
of	1
whom	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
asked	1
how	1
much	1
his	1
master	1
owed	1
him.	1
He	1
replied,	1
nine	1
months	1
at	1
seven	1
reals	1
a	1
month.	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
added	1
it	1
up,	1
found	1
that	1
it	1
came	1
to	1
sixty-three	1
reals,	1
and	1
told	1
the	1
farmer	1
to	1
pay	1
it	1
down	1
immediately,	1
if	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
want	1
to	1
die	1
for	1
it.	1
The	1
trembling	1
clown	1
replied	1
that	1
as	1
he	1
lived	1
and	1
by	1
the	1
oath	1
he	1
had	1
sworn	1
(though	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
sworn	1
any)	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
so	1
much;	1
for	1
there	1
were	1
to	1
be	1
taken	1
into	1
account	1
and	1
deducted	1
three	1
pairs	1
of	1
shoes	1
he	1
had	1
given	1
him,	1
and	1
a	1
real	1
for	1
two	1
blood-lettings	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
sick.	1
“All	1
that	1
is	1
very	1
well,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
“but	1
let	1
the	1
shoes	1
and	1
the	1
blood-lettings	1
stand	1
as	1
a	1
setoff	1
against	1
the	1
blows	1
you	1
have	1
given	1
him	1
without	1
any	1
cause;	1
for	1
if	1
he	1
spoiled	1
the	1
leather	1
of	1
the	1
shoes	1
you	1
paid	1
for,	1
you	1
have	1
damaged	1
that	1
of	1
his	1
body,	1
and	1
if	1
the	1
barber	1
took	1
blood	1
from	1
him	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
sick,	1
you	1
have	1
drawn	1
it	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
sound;	1
so	1
on	1
that	1
score	1
he	1
owes	1
you	1
nothing.”	1
“The	1
difficulty	1
is,	1
Sir	1
Knight,	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
no	1
money	1
here;	1
let	1
Andres	1
come	1
home	1
with	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
will	1
pay	1
him	1
all,	1
real	1
by	1
real.”	1
“I	1
go	1
with	1
him!”	1
said	1
the	1
youth.	1
“Nay,	1
God	1
forbid!	1
No,	1
señor,	1
not	1
for	1
the	1
world;	1
for	1
once	1
alone	1
with	1
me,	1
he	1
would	1
ray	1
me	1
like	1
a	1
Saint	1
Bartholomew.”	1
“He	1
will	1
do	1
nothing	1
of	1
the	1
kind,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
“I	1
have	1
only	1
to	1
command,	1
and	1
he	1
will	1
obey	1
me;	1
and	1
as	1
he	1
has	1
sworn	1
to	1
me	1
by	1
the	1
order	1
of	1
knighthood	1
which	1
he	1
has	1
received,	1
I	1
leave	1
him	1
free,	1
and	1
I	1
guarantee	1
the	1
payment.”	1
“Consider	1
what	1
you	1
are	1
saying,	1
señor,”	1
said	1
the	1
youth;	1
“this	1
master	1
of	1
mine	1
is	1
not	1
a	1
knight,	1
nor	1
has	1
he	1
received	1
any	1
order	1
of	1
knighthood;	1
for	1
he	1
is	1
Juan	1
Haldudo	1
the	1
Rich,	1
of	1
Quintanar.”	1
“That	1
matters	1
little,”	1
replied	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
“there	1
may	1
be	1
Haldudos	1
knights;	1
moreover,	1
everyone	1
is	1
the	1
son	1
of	1
his	1
works.”	1
“That	1
is	1
true,”	1
said	1
Andres;	1
“but	1
this	1
master	1
of	1
mine—of	1
what	1
works	1
is	1
he	1
the	1
son,	1
when	1
he	1
refuses	1
me	1
the	1
wages	1
of	1
my	1
sweat	1
and	1
labour?”	1
“I	1
do	1
not	1
refuse,	1
brother	1
Andres,”	1
said	1
the	1
farmer,	1
“be	1
good	1
enough	1
to	1
come	1
along	1
with	1
me,	1
and	1
I	1
swear	1
by	1
all	1
the	1
orders	1
of	1
knighthood	1
there	1
are	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
to	1
pay	1
you	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
agreed,	1
real	1
by	1
real,	1
and	1
perfumed.”	1
“For	1
the	1
perfumery	1
I	1
excuse	1
you,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote;	1
“give	1
it	1
to	1
him	1
in	1
reals,	1
and	1
I	1
shall	1
be	1
satisfied;	1
and	1
see	1
that	1
you	1
do	1
as	1
you	1
have	1
sworn;	1
if	1
not,	1
by	1
the	1
same	1
oath	1
I	1
swear	1
to	1
come	1
back	1
and	1
hunt	1
you	1
out	1
and	1
punish	1
you;	1
and	1
I	1
shall	1
find	1
you	1
though	1
you	1
should	1
lie	1
closer	1
than	1
a	1
lizard.	1
And	1
if	1
you	1
desire	1
to	1
know	1
who	1
it	1
is	1
lays	1
this	1
command	1
upon	1
you,	1
that	1
you	1
be	1
more	1
firmly	1
bound	1
to	1
obey	1
it,	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
the	1
valorous	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
of	1
La	1
Mancha,	1
the	1
undoer	1
of	1
wrongs	1
and	1
injustices;	1
and	1
so,	1
God	1
be	1
with	1
you,	1
and	1
keep	1
in	1
mind	1
what	1
you	1
have	1
promised	1
and	1
sworn	1
under	1
those	1
penalties	1
that	1
have	1
been	1
already	1
declared	1
to	1
you.”	1
So	1
saying,	1
he	1
gave	1
Rocinante	1
the	1
spur	1
and	1
was	1
soon	1
out	1
of	1
reach.	1
The	1
farmer	1
followed	1
him	1
with	1
his	1
eyes,	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
saw	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
cleared	1
the	1
wood	1
and	1
was	1
no	1
longer	1
in	1
sight,	1
he	1
turned	1
to	1
his	1
boy	1
Andres,	1
and	1
said,	1
“Come	1
here,	1
my	1
son,	1
I	1
want	1
to	1
pay	1
you	1
what	1
I	1
owe	1
you,	1
as	1
that	1
undoer	1
of	1
wrongs	1
has	1
commanded	1
me.”	1
“My	1
oath	1
on	1
it,”	1
said	1
Andres,	1
“your	1
worship	1
will	1
be	1
well	1
advised	1
to	1
obey	1
the	1
command	1
of	1
that	1
good	1
knight—may	1
he	1
live	1
a	1
thousand	1
years—for,	1
as	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
valiant	1
and	1
just	1
judge,	1
by	1
Roque,	1
if	1
you	1
do	1
not	1
pay	1
me,	1
he	1
will	1
come	1
back	1
and	1
do	1
as	1
he	1
said.”	1
“My	1
oath	1
on	1
it,	1
too,”	1
said	1
the	1
farmer;	1
“but	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
a	1
strong	1
affection	1
for	1
you,	1
I	1
want	1
to	1
add	1
to	1
the	1
debt	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
add	1
to	1
the	1
payment;”	1
and	1
seizing	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
arm,	1
he	1
tied	1
him	1
up	1
again,	1
and	1
gave	1
him	1
such	1
a	1
flogging	1
that	1
he	1
left	1
him	1
for	1
dead.	1
“Now,	1
Master	1
Andres,”	1
said	1
the	1
farmer,	1
“call	1
on	1
the	1
undoer	1
of	1
wrongs;	1
you	1
will	1
find	1
he	1
won’t	1
undo	1
that,	1
though	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
sure	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
quite	1
done	1
with	1
you,	1
for	1
I	1
have	1
a	1
good	1
mind	1
to	1
flay	1
you	1
alive.”	1
But	1
at	1
last	1
he	1
untied	1
him,	1
and	1
gave	1
him	1
leave	1
to	1
go	1
look	1
for	1
his	1
judge	1
in	1
order	1
to	1
put	1
the	1
sentence	1
pronounced	1
into	1
execution.	1
Andres	1
went	1
off	1
rather	1
down	1
in	1
the	1
mouth,	1
swearing	1
he	1
would	1
go	1
to	1
look	1
for	1
the	1
valiant	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
of	1
La	1
Mancha	1
and	1
tell	1
him	1
exactly	1
what	1
had	1
happened,	1
and	1
that	1
all	1
would	1
have	1
to	1
be	1
repaid	1
him	1
sevenfold;	1
but	1
for	1
all	1
that,	1
he	1
went	1
off	1
weeping,	1
while	1
his	1
master	1
stood	1
laughing.	1
Thus	1
did	1
the	1
valiant	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
right	1
that	1
wrong,	1
and,	1
thoroughly	1
satisfied	1
with	1
what	1
had	1
taken	1
place,	1
as	1
he	1
considered	1
he	1
had	1
made	1
a	1
very	1
happy	1
and	1
noble	1
beginning	1
with	1
his	1
knighthood,	1
he	1
took	1
the	1
road	1
towards	1
his	1
village	1
in	1
perfect	1
self-content,	1
saying	1
in	1
a	1
low	1
voice,	1
“Well	1
mayest	1
thou	1
this	1
day	1
call	1
thyself	1
fortunate	1
above	1
all	1
on	1
earth,	1
O	1
Dulcinea	1
del	1
Toboso,	1
fairest	1
of	1
the	1
fair!	1
since	1
it	1
has	1
fallen	1
to	1
thy	1
lot	1
to	1
hold	1
subject	1
and	1
submissive	1
to	1
thy	1
full	1
will	1
and	1
pleasure	1
a	1
knight	1
so	1
renowned	1
as	1
is	1
and	1
will	1
be	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
of	1
La	1
Mancha,	1
who,	1
as	1
all	1
the	1
world	1
knows,	1
yesterday	1
received	1
the	1
order	1
of	1
knighthood,	1
and	1
hath	1
to-day	1
righted	1
the	1
greatest	1
wrong	1
and	1
grievance	1
that	1
ever	1
injustice	1
conceived	1
and	1
cruelty	1
perpetrated:	1
who	1
hath	1
to-day	1
plucked	1
the	1
rod	1
from	1
the	1
hand	1
of	1
yonder	1
ruthless	1
oppressor	1
so	1
wantonly	1
lashing	1
that	1
tender	1
child.”	1
He	1
now	1
came	1
to	1
a	1
road	1
branching	1
in	1
four	1
directions,	1
and	1
immediately	1
he	1
was	1
reminded	1
of	1
those	1
cross-roads	1
where	1
knights-errant	1
used	1
to	1
stop	1
to	1
consider	1
which	1
road	1
they	1
should	1
take.	1
In	1
imitation	1
of	1
them	1
he	1
halted	1
for	1
a	1
while,	1
and	1
after	1
having	1
deeply	1
considered	1
it,	1
he	1
gave	1
Rocinante	1
his	1
head,	1
submitting	1
his	1
own	1
will	1
to	1
that	1
of	1
his	1
hack,	1
who	1
followed	1
out	1
his	1
first	1
intention,	1
which	1
was	1
to	1
make	1
straight	1
for	1
his	1
own	1
stable.	1
After	1
he	1
had	1
gone	1
about	1
two	1
miles	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
perceived	1
a	1
large	1
party	1
of	1
people,	1
who,	1
as	1
afterwards	1
appeared,	1
were	1
some	1
Toledo	1
traders,	1
on	1
their	1
way	1
to	1
buy	1
silk	1
at	1
Murcia.	1
There	1
were	1
six	1
of	1
them	1
coming	1
along	1
under	1
their	1
sunshades,	1
with	1
four	1
servants	1
mounted,	1
and	1
three	1
muleteers	1
on	1
foot.	1
Scarcely	1
had	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
descried	1
them	1
when	1
the	1
fancy	1
possessed	1
him	1
that	1
this	1
must	1
be	1
some	1
new	1
adventure;	1
and	1
to	1
help	1
him	1
to	1
imitate	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
he	1
could	1
those	1
passages	1
he	1
had	1
read	1
of	1
in	1
his	1
books,	1
here	1
seemed	1
to	1
come	1
one	1
made	1
on	1
purpose,	1
which	1
he	1
resolved	1
to	1
attempt.	1
So	1
with	1
a	1
lofty	1
bearing	1
and	1
determination	1
he	1
fixed	1
himself	1
firmly	1
in	1
his	1
stirrups,	1
got	1
his	1
lance	1
ready,	1
brought	1
his	1
buckler	1
before	1
his	1
breast,	1
and	1
planting	1
himself	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
road,	1
stood	1
waiting	1
the	1
approach	1
of	1
these	1
knights-errant,	1
for	1
such	1
he	1
now	1
considered	1
and	1
held	1
them	1
to	1
be;	1
and	1
when	1
they	1
had	1
come	1
near	1
enough	1
to	1
see	1
and	1
hear,	1
he	1
exclaimed	1
with	1
a	1
haughty	1
gesture,	1
“All	1
the	1
world	1
stand,	1
unless	1
all	1
the	1
world	1
confess	1
that	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
world	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
maiden	1
fairer	1
than	1
the	1
Empress	1
of	1
La	1
Mancha,	1
the	1
peerless	1
Dulcinea	1
del	1
Toboso.”	1
The	1
traders	1
halted	1
at	1
the	1
sound	1
of	1
this	1
language	1
and	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
strange	1
figure	1
that	1
uttered	1
it,	1
and	1
from	1
both	1
figure	1
and	1
language	1
at	1
once	1
guessed	1
the	1
craze	1
of	1
their	1
owner;	1
they	1
wished,	1
however,	1
to	1
learn	1
quietly	1
what	1
was	1
the	1
object	1
of	1
this	1
confession	1
that	1
was	1
demanded	1
of	1
them,	1
and	1
one	1
of	1
them,	1
who	1
was	1
rather	1
fond	1
of	1
a	1
joke	1
and	1
was	1
very	1
sharp-witted,	1
said	1
to	1
him,	1
“Sir	1
Knight,	1
we	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
who	1
this	1
good	1
lady	1
is	1
that	1
you	1
speak	1
of;	1
show	1
her	1
to	1
us,	1
for,	1
if	1
she	1
be	1
of	1
such	1
beauty	1
as	1
you	1
suggest,	1
with	1
all	1
our	1
hearts	1
and	1
without	1
any	1
pressure	1
we	1
will	1
confess	1
the	1
truth	1
that	1
is	1
on	1
your	1
part	1
required	1
of	1
us.”	1
“If	1
I	1
were	1
to	1
show	1
her	1
to	1
you,”	1
replied	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“what	1
merit	1
would	1
you	1
have	1
in	1
confessing	1
a	1
truth	1
so	1
manifest?	1
The	1
essential	1
point	1
is	1
that	1
without	1
seeing	1
her	1
you	1
must	1
believe,	1
confess,	1
affirm,	1
swear,	1
and	1
defend	1
it;	1
else	1
ye	1
have	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
me	1
in	1
battle,	1
ill-conditioned,	1
arrogant	1
rabble	1
that	1
ye	1
are;	1
and	1
come	1
ye	1
on,	1
one	1
by	1
one	1
as	1
the	1
order	1
of	1
knighthood	1
requires,	1
or	1
all	1
together	1
as	1
is	1
the	1
custom	1
and	1
vile	1
usage	1
of	1
your	1
breed,	1
here	1
do	1
I	1
bide	1
and	1
await	1
you	1
relying	1
on	1
the	1
justice	1
of	1
the	1
cause	1
I	1
maintain.”	1
“Sir	1
Knight,”	1
replied	1
the	1
trader,	1
“I	1
entreat	1
your	1
worship	1
in	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
this	1
present	1
company	1
of	1
princes,	1
that,	1
to	1
save	1
us	1
from	1
charging	1
our	1
consciences	1
with	1
the	1
confession	1
of	1
a	1
thing	1
we	1
have	1
never	1
seen	1
or	1
heard	1
of,	1
and	1
one	1
moreover	1
so	1
much	1
to	1
the	1
prejudice	1
of	1
the	1
Empresses	1
and	1
Queens	1
of	1
the	1
Alcarria	1
and	1
Estremadura,	1
your	1
worship	1
will	1
be	1
pleased	1
to	1
show	1
us	1
some	1
portrait	1
of	1
this	1
lady,	1
though	1
it	1
be	1
no	1
bigger	1
than	1
a	1
grain	1
of	1
wheat;	1
for	1
by	1
the	1
thread	1
one	1
gets	1
at	1
the	1
ball,	1
and	1
in	1
this	1
way	1
we	1
shall	1
be	1
satisfied	1
and	1
easy,	1
and	1
you	1
will	1
be	1
content	1
and	1
pleased;	1
nay,	1
I	1
believe	1
we	1
are	1
already	1
so	1
far	1
agreed	1
with	1
you	1
that	1
even	1
though	1
her	1
portrait	1
should	1
show	1
her	1
blind	1
of	1
one	1
eye,	1
and	1
distilling	1
vermilion	1
and	1
sulphur	1
from	1
the	1
other,	1
we	1
would	1
nevertheless,	1
to	1
gratify	1
your	1
worship,	1
say	1
all	1
in	1
her	1
favour	1
that	1
you	1
desire.”	1
“She	1
distils	1
nothing	1
of	1
the	1
kind,	1
vile	1
rabble,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
burning	1
with	1
rage,	1
“nothing	1
of	1
the	1
kind,	1
I	1
say,	1
only	1
ambergris	1
and	1
civet	1
in	1
cotton;	1
nor	1
is	1
she	1
one-eyed	1
or	1
humpbacked,	1
but	1
straighter	1
than	1
a	1
Guadarrama	1
spindle:	1
but	1
ye	1
must	1
pay	1
for	1
the	1
blasphemy	1
ye	1
have	1
uttered	1
against	1
beauty	1
like	1
that	1
of	1
my	1
lady.”	1
And	1
so	1
saying,	1
he	1
charged	1
with	1
levelled	1
lance	1
against	1
the	1
one	1
who	1
had	1
spoken,	1
with	1
such	1
fury	1
and	1
fierceness	1
that,	1
if	1
luck	1
had	1
not	1
contrived	1
that	1
Rocinante	1
should	1
stumble	1
midway	1
and	1
come	1
down,	1
it	1
would	1
have	1
gone	1
hard	1
with	1
the	1
rash	1
trader.	1
Down	1
went	1
Rocinante,	1
and	1
over	1
went	1
his	1
master,	1
rolling	1
along	1
the	1
ground	1
for	1
some	1
distance;	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
tried	1
to	1
rise	1
he	1
was	1
unable,	1
so	1
encumbered	1
was	1
he	1
with	1
lance,	1
buckler,	1
spurs,	1
helmet,	1
and	1
the	1
weight	1
of	1
his	1
old	1
armour;	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
while	1
he	1
was	1
struggling	1
to	1
get	1
up	1
he	1
kept	1
saying,	1
“Fly	1
not,	1
cowards	1
and	1
caitiffs!	1
stay,	1
for	1
not	1
by	1
my	1
fault,	1
but	1
my	1
horse’s,	1
am	1
I	1
stretched	1
here.”	1

One	1
of	1
the	1
muleteers	1
in	1
attendance,	1
who	1
could	1
not	1
have	1
had	1
much	1
good	1
nature	1
in	1
him,	1
hearing	1
the	1
poor	1
prostrate	1
man	1
blustering	1
in	1
this	1
style,	1
was	1
unable	1
to	1
refrain	1
from	1
giving	1
him	1
an	1
answer	1
on	1
his	1
ribs;	1
and	1
coming	1
up	1
to	1
him	1
he	1
seized	1
his	1
lance,	1
and	1
having	1
broken	1
it	1
in	1
pieces,	1
with	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
he	1
began	1
so	1
to	1
belabour	1
our	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
that,	1
notwithstanding	1
and	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
his	1
armour,	1
he	1
milled	1
him	1
like	1
a	1
measure	1
of	1
wheat.	1
His	1
masters	1
called	1
out	1
not	1
to	1
lay	1
on	1
so	1
hard	1
and	1
to	1
leave	1
him	1
alone,	1
but	1
the	1
muleteers	1
blood	1
was	1
up,	1
and	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
care	1
to	1
drop	1
the	1
game	1
until	1
he	1
had	1
vented	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
his	1
wrath,	1
and	1
gathering	1
up	1
the	1
remaining	1
fragments	1
of	1
the	1
lance	1
he	1
finished	1
with	1
a	1
discharge	1
upon	1
the	1
unhappy	1
victim,	1
who	1
all	1
through	1
the	1
storm	1
of	1
sticks	1
that	1
rained	1
on	1
him	1
never	1
ceased	1
threatening	1
heaven,	1
and	1
earth,	1
and	1
the	1
brigands,	1
for	1
such	1
they	1
seemed	1
to	1
him.	1
At	1
last	1
the	1
muleteer	1
was	1
tired,	1
and	1
the	1
traders	1
continued	1
their	1
journey,	1
taking	1
with	1
them	1
matter	1
for	1
talk	1
about	1
the	1
poor	1
fellow	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
cudgelled.	1
He	1
when	1
he	1
found	1
himself	1
alone	1
made	1
another	1
effort	1
to	1
rise;	1
but	1
if	1
he	1
was	1
unable	1
when	1
whole	1
and	1
sound,	1
how	1
was	1
he	1
to	1
rise	1
after	1
having	1
been	1
thrashed	1
and	1
well-nigh	1
knocked	1
to	1
pieces?	1
And	1
yet	1
he	1
esteemed	1
himself	1
fortunate,	1
as	1
it	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
this	1
was	1
a	1
regular	1
knight-errant’s	1
mishap,	1
and	1
entirely,	1
he	1
considered,	1
the	1
fault	1
of	1
his	1
horse.	1
However,	1
battered	1
in	1
body	1
as	1
he	1
was,	1
to	1
rise	1
was	1
beyond	1
his	1
power.	1

Finding,	1
then,	1
that,	1
in	1
fact	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
move,	1
he	1
thought	1
himself	1
of	1
having	1
recourse	1
to	1
his	1
usual	1
remedy,	1
which	1
was	1
to	1
think	1
of	1
some	1
passage	1
in	1
his	1
books,	1
and	1
his	1
craze	1
brought	1
to	1
his	1
mind	1
that	1
about	1
Baldwin	1
and	1
the	1
Marquis	1
of	1
Mantua,	1
when	1
Carloto	1
left	1
him	1
wounded	1
on	1
the	1
mountainside,	1
a	1
story	1
known	1
by	1
heart	1
by	1
the	1
children,	1
not	1
forgotten	1
by	1
the	1
young	1
men,	1
and	1
lauded	1
and	1
even	1
believed	1
by	1
the	1
old	1
folk;	1
and	1
for	1
all	1
that	1
not	1
a	1
whit	1
truer	1
than	1
the	1
miracles	1
of	1
Mahomet.	1
This	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
to	1
fit	1
exactly	1
the	1
case	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
found	1
himself,	1
so,	1
making	1
a	1
show	1
of	1
severe	1
suffering,	1
he	1
began	1
to	1
roll	1
on	1
the	1
ground	1
and	1
with	1
feeble	1
breath	1
repeat	1
the	1
very	1
words	1
which	1
the	1
wounded	1
knight	1
of	1
the	1
wood	1
is	1
said	1
to	1
have	1
uttered:	1
Where	1
art	1
thou,	1
lady	1
mine,	1
that	1
thou	1
My	1
sorrow	1
dost	1
not	1
rue?	1
Thou	1
canst	1
not	1
know	1
it,	1
lady	1
mine,	1
Or	1
else	1
thou	1
art	1
untrue.	1
And	1
so	1
he	1
went	1
on	1
with	1
the	1
ballad	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
the	1
lines:	1
O	1
noble	1
Marquis	1
of	1
Mantua,	1
My	1
Uncle	1
and	1
liege	1
lord!	1

As	1
chance	1
would	1
have	1
it,	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
got	1
to	1
this	1
line	1
there	1
happened	1
to	1
come	1
by	1
a	1
peasant	1
from	1
his	1
own	1
village,	1
a	1
neighbour	1
of	1
his,	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
with	1
a	1
load	1
of	1
wheat	1
to	1
the	1
mill,	1
and	1
he,	1
seeing	1
the	1
man	1
stretched	1
there,	1
came	1
up	1
to	1
him	1
and	1
asked	1
him	1
who	1
he	1
was	1
and	1
what	1
was	1
the	1
matter	1
with	1
him	1
that	1
he	1
complained	1
so	1
dolefully.	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
was	1
firmly	1
persuaded	1
that	1
this	1
was	1
the	1
Marquis	1
of	1
Mantua,	1
his	1
uncle,	1
so	1
the	1
only	1
answer	1
he	1
made	1
was	1
to	1
go	1
on	1
with	1
his	1
ballad,	1
in	1
which	1
he	1
told	1
the	1
tale	1
of	1
his	1
misfortune,	1
and	1
of	1
the	1
loves	1
of	1
the	1
Emperor’s	1
son	1
and	1
his	1
wife	1
all	1
exactly	1
as	1
the	1
ballad	1
sings	1
it.	1
The	1
peasant	1
stood	1
amazed	1
at	1
hearing	1
such	1
nonsense,	1
and	1
relieving	1
him	1
of	1
the	1
visor,	1
already	1
battered	1
to	1
pieces	1
by	1
blows,	1
he	1
wiped	1
his	1
face,	1
which	1
was	1
covered	1
with	1
dust,	1
and	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
so	1
he	1
recognised	1
him	1
and	1
said,	1
“Señor	1
Quixada”	1
(for	1
so	1
he	1
appears	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
called	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
in	1
his	1
senses	1
and	1
had	1
not	1
yet	1
changed	1
from	1
a	1
quiet	1
country	1
gentleman	1
into	1
a	1
knight-errant),	1
“who	1
has	1
brought	1
your	1
worship	1
to	1
this	1
pass?”	1
But	1
to	1
all	1
questions	1
the	1
other	1
only	1
went	1
on	1
with	1
his	1
ballad.	1
Seeing	1
this,	1
the	1
good	1
man	1
removed	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
he	1
could	1
his	1
breastplate	1
and	1
backpiece	1
to	1
see	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
any	1
wound,	1
but	1
he	1
could	1
perceive	1
no	1
blood	1
nor	1
any	1
mark	1
whatever.	1
He	1
then	1
contrived	1
to	1
raise	1
him	1
from	1
the	1
ground,	1
and	1
with	1
no	1
little	1
difficulty	1
hoisted	1
him	1
upon	1
his	1
ass,	1
which	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
to	1
be	1
the	1
easiest	1
mount	1
for	1
him;	1
and	1
collecting	1
the	1
arms,	1
even	1
to	1
the	1
splinters	1
of	1
the	1
lance,	1
he	1
tied	1
them	1
on	1
Rocinante,	1
and	1
leading	1
him	1
by	1
the	1
bridle	1
and	1
the	1
ass	1
by	1
the	1
halter	1
he	1
took	1
the	1
road	1
for	1
the	1
village,	1
very	1
sad	1
to	1
hear	1
what	1
absurd	1
stuff	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
was	1
talking.	1

Size	1
Nor	1
was	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
less	1
so,	1
for	1
what	1
with	1
blows	1
and	1
bruises	1
he	1
could	1
not	1
sit	1
upright	1
on	1
the	1
ass,	1
and	1
from	1
time	1
to	1
time	1
he	1
sent	1
up	1
sighs	1
to	1
heaven,	1
so	1
that	1
once	1
more	1
he	1
drove	1
the	1
peasant	1
to	1
ask	1
what	1
ailed	1
him.	1
And	1
it	1
could	1
have	1
been	1
only	1
the	1
devil	1
himself	1
that	1
put	1
into	1
his	1
head	1
tales	1
to	1
match	1
his	1
own	1
adventures,	1
for	1
now,	1
forgetting	1
Baldwin,	1
he	1
bethought	1
himself	1
of	1
the	1
Moor	1
Abindarraez,	1
when	1
the	1
Alcaide	1
of	1
Antequera,	1
Rodrigo	1
de	1
Narvaez,	1
took	1
him	1
prisoner	1
and	1
carried	1
him	1
away	1
to	1
his	1
castle;	1
so	1
that	1
when	1
the	1
peasant	1
again	1
asked	1
him	1
how	1
he	1
was	1
and	1
what	1
ailed	1
him,	1
he	1
gave	1
him	1
for	1
reply	1
the	1
same	1
words	1
and	1
phrases	1
that	1
the	1
captive	1
Abindarraez	1
gave	1
to	1
Rodrigo	1
de	1
Narvaez,	1
just	1
as	1
he	1
had	1
read	1
the	1
story	1
in	1
the	1
“Diana”	1
of	1
Jorge	1
de	1
Montemayor	1
where	1
it	1
is	1
written,	1
applying	1
it	1
to	1
his	1
own	1
case	1
so	1
aptly	1
that	1
the	1
peasant	1
went	1
along	1
cursing	1
his	1
fate	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
listen	1
to	1
such	1
a	1
lot	1
of	1
nonsense;	1
from	1
which,	1
however,	1
he	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
conclusion	1
that	1
his	1
neighbour	1
was	1
mad,	1
and	1
so	1
made	1
all	1
haste	1
to	1
reach	1
the	1
village	1
to	1
escape	1
the	1
wearisomeness	1
of	1
this	1
harangue	1
of	1
Don	1
Quixote’s;	1
who,	1
at	1
the	1
end	1
of	1
it,	1
said,	1
“Señor	1
Don	1
Rodrigo	1
de	1
Narvaez,	1
your	1
worship	1
must	1
know	1
that	1
this	1
fair	1
Xarifa	1
I	1
have	1
mentioned	1
is	1
now	1
the	1
lovely	1
Dulcinea	1
del	1
Toboso,	1
for	1
whom	1
I	1
have	1
done,	1
am	1
doing,	1
and	1
will	1
do	1
the	1
most	1
famous	1
deeds	1
of	1
chivalry	1
that	1
in	1
this	1
world	1
have	1
been	1
seen,	1
are	1
to	1
be	1
seen,	1
or	1
ever	1
shall	1
be	1
seen.”	1
To	1
this	1
the	1
peasant	1
answered,	1
“Señor—sinner	1
that	1
I	1
am!—cannot	1
your	1
worship	1
see	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
Don	1
Rodrigo	1
de	1
Narvaez	1
nor	1
the	1
Marquis	1
of	1
Mantua,	1
but	1
Pedro	1
Alonso	1
your	1
neighbour,	1
and	1
that	1
your	1
worship	1
is	1
neither	1
Baldwin	1
nor	1
Abindarraez,	1
but	1
the	1
worthy	1
gentleman	1
Señor	1
Quixada?”	1
“I	1
know	1
who	1
I	1
am,”	1
replied	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“and	1
I	1
know	1
that	1
I	1
may	1
be	1
not	1
only	1
those	1
I	1
have	1
named,	1
but	1
all	1
the	1
Twelve	1
Peers	1
of	1
France	1
and	1
even	1
all	1
the	1
Nine	1
Worthies,	1
since	1
my	1
achievements	1
surpass	1
all	1
that	1
they	1
have	1
done	1
all	1
together	1
and	1
each	1
of	1
them	1
on	1
his	1
own	1
account.”	1
With	1
this	1
talk	1
and	1
more	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
kind	1
they	1
reached	1
the	1
village	1
just	1
as	1
night	1
was	1
beginning	1
to	1
fall,	1
but	1
the	1
peasant	1
waited	1
until	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
little	1
later	1
that	1
the	1
belaboured	1
gentleman	1
might	1
not	1
be	1
seen	1
riding	1
in	1
such	1
a	1
miserable	1
trim.	1
When	1
it	1
was	1
what	1
seemed	1
to	1
him	1
the	1
proper	1
time	1
he	1
entered	1
the	1
village	1
and	1
went	1
to	1
Don	1
Quixote’s	1
house,	1
which	1
he	1
found	1
all	1
in	1
confusion,	1
and	1
there	1
were	1
the	1
curate	1
and	1
the	1
village	1
barber,	1
who	1
were	1
great	1
friends	1
of	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
and	1
his	1
housekeeper	1
was	1
saying	1
to	1
them	1
in	1
a	1
loud	1
voice,	1
“What	1
does	1
your	1
worship	1
think	1
can	1
have	1
befallen	1
my	1
master,	1
Señor	1
Licentiate	1
Pero	1
Perez?”	1
for	1
so	1
the	1
curate	1
was	1
called;	1
“it	1
is	1
three	1
days	1
now	1
since	1
anything	1
has	1
been	1
seen	1
of	1
him,	1
or	1
the	1
hack,	1
or	1
the	1
buckler,	1
lance,	1
or	1
armour.	1
Miserable	1
me!	1
I	1
am	1
certain	1
of	1
it,	1
and	1
it	1
is	1
as	1
true	1
as	1
that	1
I	1
was	1
born	1
to	1
die,	1
that	1
these	1
accursed	1
books	1
of	1
chivalry	1
he	1
has,	1
and	1
has	1
got	1
into	1
the	1
way	1
of	1
reading	1
so	1
constantly,	1
have	1
upset	1
his	1
reason;	1
for	1
now	1
I	1
remember	1
having	1
often	1
heard	1
him	1
saying	1
to	1
himself	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
turn	1
knight-errant	1
and	1
go	1
all	1
over	1
the	1
world	1
in	1
quest	1
of	1
adventures.	1
To	1
the	1
devil	1
and	1
Barabbas	1
with	1
such	1
books,	1
that	1
have	1
brought	1
to	1
ruin	1
in	1
this	1
way	1
the	1
finest	1
understanding	1
there	1
was	1
in	1
all	1
La	1
Mancha!”	1
The	1
niece	1
said	1
the	1
same,	1
and,	1
more:	1
“You	1
must	1
know,	1
Master	1
Nicholas”—for	1
that	1
was	1
the	1
name	1
of	1
the	1
barber—“it	1
was	1
often	1
my	1
uncle’s	1
way	1
to	1
stay	1
two	1
days	1
and	1
nights	1
together	1
poring	1
over	1
these	1
unholy	1
books	1
of	1
misventures,	1
after	1
which	1
he	1
would	1
fling	1
the	1
book	1
away	1
and	1
snatch	1
up	1
his	1
sword	1
and	1
fall	1
to	1
slashing	1
the	1
walls;	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
tired	1
out	1
he	1
would	1
say	1
he	1
had	1
killed	1
four	1
giants	1
like	1
four	1
towers;	1
and	1
the	1
sweat	1
that	1
flowed	1
from	1
him	1
when	1
he	1
was	1
weary	1
he	1
said	1
was	1
the	1
blood	1
of	1
the	1
wounds	1
he	1
had	1
received	1
in	1
battle;	1
and	1
then	1
he	1
would	1
drink	1
a	1
great	1
jug	1
of	1
cold	1
water	1
and	1
become	1
calm	1
and	1
quiet,	1
saying	1
that	1
this	1
water	1
was	1
a	1
most	1
precious	1
potion	1
which	1
the	1
sage	1
Esquife,	1
a	1
great	1
magician	1
and	1
friend	1
of	1
his,	1
had	1
brought	1
him.	1
But	1
I	1
take	1
all	1
the	1
blame	1
upon	1
myself	1
for	1
never	1
having	1
told	1
your	1
worships	1
of	1
my	1
uncle’s	1
vagaries,	1
that	1
you	1
might	1
put	1
a	1
stop	1
to	1
them	1
before	1
things	1
had	1
come	1
to	1
this	1
pass,	1
and	1
burn	1
all	1
these	1
accursed	1
books—for	1
he	1
has	1
a	1
great	1
number—that	1
richly	1
deserve	1
to	1
be	1
burned	1
like	1
heretics.”	1
“So	1
say	1
I	1
too,”	1
said	1
the	1
curate,	1
“and	1
by	1
my	1
faith	1
to-morrow	1
shall	1
not	1
pass	1
without	1
public	1
judgment	1
upon	1
them,	1
and	1
may	1
they	1
be	1
condemned	1
to	1
the	1
flames	1
lest	1
they	1
lead	1
those	1
that	1
read	1
to	1
behave	1
as	1
my	1
good	1
friend	1
seems	1
to	1
have	1
behaved.”	1
All	1
this	1
the	1
peasant	1
heard,	1
and	1
from	1
it	1
he	1
understood	1
at	1
last	1
what	1
was	1
the	1
matter	1
with	1
his	1
neighbour,	1
so	1
he	1
began	1
calling	1
aloud,	1
“Open,	1
your	1
worships,	1
to	1
Señor	1
Baldwin	1
and	1
to	1
Señor	1
the	1
Marquis	1
of	1
Mantua,	1
who	1
comes	1
badly	1
wounded,	1
and	1
to	1
Señor	1
Abindarraez,	1
the	1
Moor,	1
whom	1
the	1
valiant	1
Rodrigo	1
de	1
Narvaez,	1
the	1
Alcaide	1
of	1
Antequera,	1
brings	1
captive.”	1
At	1
these	1
words	1
they	1
all	1
hurried	1
out,	1
and	1
when	1
they	1
recognised	1
their	1
friend,	1
master,	1
and	1
uncle,	1
who	1
had	1
not	1
yet	1
dismounted	1
from	1
the	1
ass	1
because	1
he	1
could	1
not,	1
they	1
ran	1
to	1
embrace	1
him.	1
“Hold!”	1
said	1
he,	1
“for	1
I	1
am	1
badly	1
wounded	1
through	1
my	1
horse’s	1
fault;	1
carry	1
me	1
to	1
bed,	1
and	1
if	1
possible	1
send	1
for	1
the	1
wise	1
Urganda	1
to	1
cure	1
and	1
see	1
to	1
my	1
wounds.”	1
“See	1
there!	1
plague	1
on	1
it!”	1
cried	1
the	1
housekeeper	1
at	1
this:	1
“did	1
not	1
my	1
heart	1
tell	1
the	1
truth	1
as	1
to	1
which	1
foot	1
my	1
master	1
went	1
lame	1
of?	1
To	1
bed	1
with	1
your	1
worship	1
at	1
once,	1
and	1
we	1
will	1
contrive	1
to	1
cure	1
you	1
here	1
without	1
fetching	1
that	1
Hurgada.	1
A	1
curse	1
I	1
say	1
once	1
more,	1
and	1
a	1
hundred	1
times	1
more,	1
on	1
those	1
books	1
of	1
chivalry	1
that	1
have	1
brought	1
your	1
worship	1
to	1
such	1
a	1
pass.”	1
They	1
carried	1
him	1
to	1
bed	1
at	1
once,	1
and	1
after	1
searching	1
for	1
his	1
wounds	1
could	1
find	1
none,	1
but	1
he	1
said	1
they	1
were	1
all	1
bruises	1
from	1
having	1
had	1
a	1
severe	1
fall	1
with	1
his	1
horse	1
Rocinante	1
when	1
in	1
combat	1
with	1
ten	1
giants,	1
the	1
biggest	1
and	1
the	1
boldest	1
to	1
be	1
found	1
on	1
earth.	1
“So,	1
so!”	1
said	1
the	1
curate,	1
“are	1
there	1
giants	1
in	1
the	1
dance?	1
By	1
the	1
sign	1
of	1
the	1
Cross	1
I	1
will	1
burn	1
them	1
to-morrow	1
before	1
the	1
day	1
is	1
over.”	1
They	1
put	1
a	1
host	1
of	1
questions	1
to	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
but	1
his	1
only	1
answer	1
to	1
all	1
was—give	1
him	1
something	1
to	1
eat,	1
and	1
leave	1
him	1
to	1
sleep,	1
for	1
that	1
was	1
what	1
he	1
needed	1
most.	1
They	1
did	1
so,	1
and	1
the	1
curate	1
questioned	1
the	1
peasant	1
at	1
great	1
length	1
as	1
to	1
how	1
he	1
had	1
found	1
Don	1
Quixote.	1
He	1
told	1
him,	1
and	1
the	1
nonsense	1
he	1
had	1
talked	1
when	1
found	1
and	1
on	1
the	1
way	1
home,	1
all	1
which	1
made	1
the	1
licentiate	1
the	1
more	1
eager	1
to	1
do	1
what	1
he	1
did	1
the	1
next	1
day,	1
which	1
was	1
to	1
summon	1
his	1
friend	1
the	1
barber,	1
Master	1
Nicholas,	1
and	1
go	1
with	1
him	1
to	1
Don	1
Quixote’s	1
house.	1

OF	1
THE	1
DIVERTING	1
AND	1
IMPORTANT	1
SCRUTINY	1
WHICH	1
THE	1
CURATE	1
AND	1
THE	1
BARBER	1
MADE	1
IN	1

LIBRARY	1
OF	1
OUR	1
INGENIOUS	1
GENTLEMAN	1

Full	1
Size	1
He	1
was	1
still	1
sleeping;	1
so	1
the	1
curate	1
asked	1
the	1
niece	1
for	1
the	1
keys	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
where	1
the	1
books,	1
the	1
authors	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
mischief,	1
were,	1
and	1
right	1
willingly	1
she	1
gave	1
them.	1
They	1
all	1
went	1
in,	1
the	1
housekeeper	1
with	1
them,	1
and	1
found	1
more	1
than	1
a	1
hundred	1
volumes	1
of	1
big	1
books	1
very	1
well	1
bound,	1
and	1
some	1
other	1
small	1
ones.	1
The	1
moment	1
the	1
housekeeper	1
saw	1
them	1
she	1
turned	1
about	1
and	1
ran	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
room,	1
and	1
came	1
back	1
immediately	1
with	1
a	1
saucer	1
of	1
holy	1
water	1
and	1
a	1
sprinkler,	1
saying,	1
“Here,	1
your	1
worship,	1
señor	1
licentiate,	1
sprinkle	1
this	1
room;	1
don’t	1
leave	1
any	1
magician	1
of	1
the	1
many	1
there	1
are	1
in	1
these	1
books	1
to	1
bewitch	1
us	1
in	1
revenge	1
for	1
our	1
design	1
of	1
banishing	1
them	1
from	1
the	1
world.”	1
The	1
simplicity	1
of	1
the	1
housekeeper	1
made	1
the	1
licentiate	1
laugh,	1
and	1
he	1
directed	1
the	1
barber	1
to	1
give	1
him	1
the	1
books	1
one	1
by	1
one	1
to	1
see	1
what	1
they	1
were	1
about,	1
as	1
there	1
might	1
be	1
some	1
to	1
be	1
found	1
among	1
them	1
that	1
did	1
not	1
deserve	1
the	1
penalty	1
of	1
fire.	1
“No,”	1
said	1
the	1
niece,	1
“there	1
is	1
no	1
reason	1
for	1
showing	1
mercy	1
to	1
any	1
of	1
them;	1
they	1
have	1
every	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
done	1
mischief;	1
better	1
fling	1
them	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
window	1
into	1
the	1
court	1
and	1
make	1
a	1
pile	1
of	1
them	1
and	1
set	1
fire	1
to	1
them;	1
or	1
else	1
carry	1
them	1
into	1
the	1
yard,	1
and	1
there	1
a	1
bonfire	1
can	1
be	1
made	1
without	1
the	1
smoke	1
giving	1
any	1
annoyance.”	1
The	1
housekeeper	1
said	1
the	1
same,	1
so	1
eager	1
were	1
they	1
both	1
for	1
the	1
slaughter	1
of	1
those	1
innocents,	1
but	1
the	1
curate	1
would	1
not	1
agree	1
to	1
it	1
without	1
first	1
reading	1
at	1
any	1
rate	1
the	1
titles.	1
The	1
first	1
that	1
Master	1
Nicholas	1
put	1
into	1
his	1
hand	1
was	1
“The	1
four	1
books	1
of	1
Amadis	1
of	1
Gaul.”	1
“This	1
seems	1
a	1
mysterious	1
thing,”	1
said	1
the	1
curate,	1
“for,	1
as	1
I	1
have	1
heard	1
say,	1
this	1
was	1
the	1
first	1
book	1
of	1
chivalry	1
printed	1
in	1
Spain,	1
and	1
from	1
this	1
all	1
the	1
others	1
derive	1
their	1
birth	1
and	1
origin;	1
so	1
it	1
seems	1
to	1
me	1
that	1
we	1
ought	1
inexorably	1
to	1
condemn	1
it	1
to	1
the	1
flames	1
as	1
the	1
founder	1
of	1
so	1
vile	1
a	1
sect.”	1
“Nay,	1
sir,”	1
said	1
the	1
barber,	1
“I	1
too,	1
have	1
heard	1
say	1
that	1
this	1
is	1
the	1
best	1
of	1
all	1
the	1
books	1
of	1
this	1
kind	1
that	1
have	1
been	1
written,	1
and	1
so,	1
as	1
something	1
singular	1
in	1
its	1
line,	1
it	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
pardoned.”	1
“True,”	1
said	1
the	1
curate;	1
“and	1
for	1
that	1
reason	1
let	1
its	1
life	1
be	1
spared	1
for	1
the	1
present.	1
Let	1
us	1
see	1
that	1
other	1
which	1
is	1
next	1
to	1
it.”	1
“It	1
is,”	1
said	1
the	1
barber,	1
“the	1
‘Sergas	1
de	1
Esplandian,’	1
the	1
lawful	1
son	1
of	1
Amadis	1
of	1
Gaul.”	1
“Then	1
verily,”	1
said	1
the	1
curate,	1
“the	1
merit	1
of	1
the	1
father	1
must	1
not	1
be	1
put	1
down	1
to	1
the	1
account	1
of	1
the	1
son.	1
Take	1
it,	1
mistress	1
housekeeper;	1
open	1
the	1
window	1
and	1
fling	1
it	1
into	1
the	1
yard	1
and	1
lay	1
the	1
foundation	1
of	1
the	1
pile	1
for	1
the	1
bonfire	1
we	1
are	1
to	1
make.”	1
The	1
housekeeper	1
obeyed	1
with	1
great	1
satisfaction,	1
and	1
the	1
worthy	1
“Esplandian”	1
went	1
flying	1
into	1
the	1
yard	1
to	1
await	1
with	1
all	1
patience	1
the	1
fire	1
that	1
was	1
in	1
store	1
for	1
him.	1
“Proceed,”	1
said	1
the	1
curate.	1
“This	1
that	1
comes	1
next,”	1
said	1
the	1
barber,	1
“is	1
‘Amadis	1
of	1
Greece,’	1
and,	1
indeed,	1
I	1
believe	1
all	1
those	1
on	1
this	1
side	1
are	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
Amadis	1
lineage.”	1
“Then	1
to	1
the	1
yard	1
with	1
the	1
whole	1
of	1
them,”	1
said	1
the	1
curate;	1
“for	1
to	1
have	1
the	1
burning	1
of	1
Queen	1
Pintiquiniestra,	1
and	1
the	1
shepherd	1
Darinel	1
and	1
his	1
eclogues,	1
and	1
the	1
bedevilled	1
and	1
involved	1
discourses	1
of	1
his	1
author,	1
I	1
would	1
burn	1
with	1
them	1
the	1
father	1
who	1
begot	1
me	1
if	1
he	1
were	1
going	1
about	1
in	1
the	1
guise	1
of	1
a	1
knight-errant.”	1
“I	1
am	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
mind,”	1
said	1
the	1
barber.	1
“And	1
so	1
am	1
I,”	1
added	1
the	1
niece.	1
“In	1
that	1
case,”	1
said	1
the	1
housekeeper,	1
“here,	1
into	1
the	1
yard	1
with	1
them!”	1
They	1
were	1
handed	1
to	1
her,	1
and	1
as	1
there	1
were	1
many	1
of	1
them,	1
she	1
spared	1
herself	1
the	1
staircase,	1
and	1
flung	1
them	1
down	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
window.	1
“Who	1
is	1
that	1
tub	1
there?”	1
said	1
the	1
curate.	1
“This,”	1
said	1
the	1
barber,	1
“is	1
‘Don	1
Olivante	1
de	1
Laura.’”	1
“The	1
author	1
of	1
that	1
book,”	1
said	1
the	1
curate,	1
“was	1
the	1
same	1
that	1
wrote	1
‘The	1
Garden	1
of	1
Flowers,’	1
and	1
truly	1
there	1
is	1
no	1
deciding	1
which	1
of	1
the	1
two	1
books	1
is	1
the	1
more	1
truthful,	1
or,	1
to	1
put	1
it	1
better,	1
the	1
less	1
lying;	1
all	1
I	1
can	1
say	1
is,	1
send	1
this	1
one	1
into	1
the	1
yard	1
for	1
a	1
swaggering	1
fool.”	1
“This	1
that	1
follows	1
is	1
‘Florismarte	1
of	1
Hircania,’”	1
said	1
the	1
barber.	1
“Señor	1
Florismarte	1
here?”	1
said	1
the	1
curate;	1
“then	1
by	1
my	1
faith	1
he	1
must	1
take	1
up	1
his	1
quarters	1
in	1
the	1
yard,	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
his	1
marvellous	1
birth	1
and	1
visionary	1
adventures,	1
for	1
the	1
stiffness	1
and	1
dryness	1
of	1
his	1
style	1
deserve	1
nothing	1
else;	1
into	1
the	1
yard	1
with	1
him	1
and	1
the	1
other,	1
mistress	1
housekeeper.”	1
“With	1
all	1
my	1
heart,	1
señor,”	1
said	1
she,	1
and	1
executed	1
the	1
order	1
with	1
great	1
delight.	1
“This,”	1
said	1
the	1
barber,	1
“is	1
‘The	1
Knight	1
Platir.’”	1
“An	1
old	1
book	1
that,”	1
said	1
the	1
curate,	1
“but	1
I	1
find	1
no	1
reason	1
for	1
clemency	1
in	1
it;	1
send	1
it	1
after	1
the	1
others	1
without	1
appeal;”	1
which	1
was	1
done.	1
Another	1
book	1
was	1
opened,	1
and	1
they	1
saw	1
it	1
was	1
entitled,	1
“The	1
Knight	1
of	1
the	1
Cross.”	1
“For	1
the	1
sake	1
of	1
the	1
holy	1
name	1
this	1
book	1
has,”	1
said	1
the	1
curate,	1
“its	1
ignorance	1
might	1
be	1
excused;	1
but	1
then,	1
they	1
say,	1
‘behind	1
the	1
cross	1
there’s	1
the	1
devil;’	1
to	1
the	1
fire	1
with	1
it.”	1
Taking	1
down	1
another	1
book,	1
the	1
barber	1
said,	1
“This	1
is	1
‘The	1
Mirror	1
of	1
Chivalry.’”	1
“I	1
know	1
his	1
worship,”	1
said	1
the	1
curate;	1
“that	1
is	1
where	1
Señor	1
Reinaldos	1
of	1
Montalvan	1
figures	1
with	1
his	1
friends	1
and	1
comrades,	1
greater	1
thieves	1
than	1
Cacus,	1
and	1
the	1
Twelve	1
Peers	1
of	1
France	1
with	1
the	1
veracious	1
historian	1
Turpin;	1
however,	1
I	1
am	1
not	1
for	1
condemning	1
them	1
to	1
more	1
than	1
perpetual	1
banishment,	1
because,	1
at	1
any	1
rate,	1
they	1
have	1
some	1
share	1
in	1
the	1
invention	1
of	1
the	1
famous	1
Matteo	1
Boiardo,	1
whence	1
too	1
the	1
Christian	1
poet	1
Ludovico	1
Ariosto	1
wove	1
his	1
web,	1
to	1
whom,	1
if	1
I	1
find	1
him	1
here,	1
and	1
speaking	1
any	1
language	1
but	1
his	1
own,	1
I	1
shall	1
show	1
no	1
respect	1
whatever;	1
but	1
if	1
he	1
speaks	1
his	1
own	1
tongue	1
I	1
will	1
put	1
him	1
upon	1
my	1
head.”	1
“Well,	1
I	1
have	1
him	1
in	1
Italian,”	1
said	1
the	1
barber,	1
“but	1
I	1
do	1
not	1
understand	1
him.”	1
“Nor	1
would	1
it	1
be	1
well	1
that	1
you	1
should	1
understand	1
him,”	1
said	1
the	1
curate,	1
“and	1
on	1
that	1
score	1
we	1
might	1
have	1
excused	1
the	1
Captain	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
brought	1
him	1
into	1
Spain	1
and	1
turned	1
him	1
into	1
Castilian.	1
He	1
robbed	1
him	1
of	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
of	1
his	1
natural	1
force,	1
and	1
so	1
do	1
all	1
those	1
who	1
try	1
to	1
turn	1
books	1
written	1
in	1
verse	1
into	1
another	1
language,	1
for,	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
pains	1
they	1
take	1
and	1
all	1
the	1
cleverness	1
they	1
show,	1
they	1
never	1
can	1
reach	1
the	1
level	1
of	1
the	1
originals	1
as	1
they	1
were	1
first	1
produced.	1
In	1
short,	1
I	1
say	1
that	1
this	1
book,	1
and	1
all	1
that	1
may	1
be	1
found	1
treating	1
of	1
those	1
French	1
affairs,	1
should	1
be	1
thrown	1
into	1
or	1
deposited	1
in	1
some	1
dry	1
well,	1
until	1
after	1
more	1
consideration	1
it	1
is	1
settled	1
what	1
is	1
to	1
be	1
done	1
with	1
them;	1
excepting	1
always	1
one	1
‘Bernardo	1
del	1
Carpio’	1
that	1
is	1
going	1
about,	1
and	1
another	1
called	1
‘Roncesvalles;’	1
for	1
these,	1
if	1
they	1
come	1
into	1
my	1
hands,	1
shall	1
pass	1
at	1
once	1
into	1
those	1
of	1
the	1
housekeeper,	1
and	1
from	1
hers	1
into	1
the	1
fire	1
without	1
any	1
reprieve.”	1
To	1
all	1
this	1
the	1
barber	1
gave	1
his	1
assent,	1
and	1
looked	1
upon	1
it	1
as	1
right	1
and	1
proper,	1
being	1
persuaded	1
that	1
the	1
curate	1
was	1
so	1
staunch	1
to	1
the	1
Faith	1
and	1
loyal	1
to	1
the	1
Truth	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
for	1
the	1
world	1
say	1
anything	1
opposed	1
to	1
them.	1
Opening	1
another	1
book	1
he	1
saw	1
it	1
was	1
“Palmerin	1
de	1
Oliva,”	1
and	1
beside	1
it	1
was	1
another	1
called	1
“Palmerin	1
of	1
England,”	1
seeing	1
which	1
the	1
licentiate	1
said,	1
“Let	1
the	1
Olive	1
be	1
made	1
firewood	1
of	1
at	1
once	1
and	1
burned	1
until	1
no	1
ashes	1
even	1
are	1
left;	1
and	1
let	1
that	1
Palm	1
of	1
England	1
be	1
kept	1
and	1
preserved	1
as	1
a	1
thing	1
that	1
stands	1
alone,	1
and	1
let	1
such	1
another	1
case	1
be	1
made	1
for	1
it	1
as	1
that	1
which	1
Alexander	1
found	1
among	1
the	1
spoils	1
of	1
Darius	1
and	1
set	1
aside	1
for	1
the	1
safe	1
keeping	1
of	1
the	1
works	1
of	1
the	1
poet	1
Homer.	1
This	1
book,	1
gossip,	1
is	1
of	1
authority	1
for	1
two	1
reasons,	1
first	1
because	1
it	1
is	1
very	1
good,	1
and	1
secondly	1
because	1
it	1
is	1
said	1
to	1
have	1
been	1
written	1
by	1
a	1
wise	1
and	1
witty	1
king	1
of	1
Portugal.	1
All	1
the	1
adventures	1
at	1
the	1
Castle	1
of	1
Miraguarda	1
are	1
excellent	1
and	1
of	1
admirable	1
contrivance,	1
and	1
the	1
language	1
is	1
polished	1
and	1
clear,	1
studying	1
and	1
observing	1
the	1
style	1
befitting	1
the	1
speaker	1
with	1
propriety	1
and	1
judgment.	1
So	1
then,	1
provided	1
it	1
seems	1
good	1
to	1
you,	1
Master	1
Nicholas,	1
I	1
say	1
let	1
this	1
and	1
‘Amadis	1
of	1
Gaul’	1
be	1
remitted	1
the	1
penalty	1
of	1
fire,	1
and	1
as	1
for	1
all	1
the	1
rest,	1
let	1
them	1
perish	1
without	1
further	1
question	1
or	1
query.”	1
“Nay,	1
gossip,”	1
said	1
the	1
barber,	1
“for	1
this	1
that	1
I	1
have	1
here	1
is	1
the	1
famous	1
‘Don	1
Belianis.’”	1
“Well,”	1
said	1
the	1
curate,	1
“that	1
and	1
the	1
second,	1
third,	1
and	1
fourth	1
parts	1
all	1
stand	1
in	1
need	1
of	1
a	1
little	1
rhubarb	1
to	1
purge	1
their	1
excess	1
of	1
bile,	1
and	1
they	1
must	1
be	1
cleared	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
stuff	1
about	1
the	1
Castle	1
of	1
Fame	1
and	1
other	1
greater	1
affectations,	1
to	1
which	1
end	1
let	1
them	1
be	1
allowed	1
the	1
over-seas	1
term,	1
and,	1
according	1
as	1
they	1
mend,	1
so	1
shall	1
mercy	1
or	1
justice	1
be	1
meted	1
out	1
to	1
them;	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
mean	1
time,	1
gossip,	1
do	1
you	1
keep	1
them	1
in	1
your	1
house	1
and	1
let	1
no	1
one	1
read	1
them.”	1
“With	1
all	1
my	1
heart,”	1
said	1
the	1
barber;	1
and	1
not	1
caring	1
to	1
tire	1
himself	1
with	1
reading	1
more	1
books	1
of	1
chivalry,	1
he	1
told	1
the	1
housekeeper	1
to	1
take	1
all	1
the	1
big	1
ones	1
and	1
throw	1
them	1
into	1
the	1
yard.	1
It	1
was	1
not	1
said	1
to	1
one	1
dull	1
or	1
deaf,	1
but	1
to	1
one	1
who	1
enjoyed	1
burning	1
them	1
more	1
than	1
weaving	1
the	1
broadest	1
and	1
finest	1
web	1
that	1
could	1
be;	1
and	1
seizing	1
about	1
eight	1
at	1
a	1
time,	1
she	1
flung	1
them	1
out	1
of	1
the	1
window.	1
In	1
carrying	1
so	1
many	1
together	1
she	1
let	1
one	1
fall	1
at	1
the	1
feet	1
of	1
the	1
barber,	1
who	1
took	1
it	1
up,	1
curious	1
to	1
know	1
whose	1
it	1
was,	1
and	1
found	1
it	1
said,	1
“History	1
of	1
the	1
Famous	1
Knight,	1
Tirante	1
el	1
Blanco.”	1
“God	1
bless	1
me!”	1
said	1
the	1
curate	1
with	1
a	1
shout,	1
“‘Tirante	1
el	1
Blanco’	1
here!	1
Hand	1
it	1
over,	1
gossip,	1
for	1
in	1
it	1
I	1
reckon	1
I	1
have	1
found	1
a	1
treasury	1
of	1
enjoyment	1
and	1
a	1
mine	1
of	1
recreation.	1
Here	1
is	1
Don	1
Kyrieleison	1
of	1
Montalvan,	1
a	1
valiant	1
knight,	1
and	1
his	1
brother	1
Thomas	1
of	1
Montalvan,	1
and	1
the	1
knight	1
Fonseca,	1
with	1
the	1
battle	1
the	1
bold	1
Tirante	1
fought	1
with	1
the	1
mastiff,	1
and	1
the	1
witticisms	1
of	1
the	1
damsel	1
Placerdemivida,	1
and	1
the	1
loves	1
and	1
wiles	1
of	1
the	1
widow	1
Reposada,	1
and	1
the	1
empress	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
the	1
squire	1
Hipolito—in	1
truth,	1
gossip,	1
by	1
right	1
of	1
its	1
style	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
best	1
book	1
in	1
the	1
world.	1
Here	1
knights	1
eat	1
and	1
sleep,	1
and	1
die	1
in	1
their	1
beds,	1
and	1
make	1
their	1
wills	1
before	1
dying,	1
and	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
more	1
of	1
which	1
there	1
is	1
nothing	1
in	1
all	1
the	1
other	1
books.	1
Nevertheless,	1
I	1
say	1
he	1
who	1
wrote	1
it,	1
for	1
deliberately	1
composing	1
such	1
fooleries,	1
deserves	1
to	1
be	1
sent	1
to	1
the	1
galleys	1
for	1
life.	1
Take	1
it	1
home	1
with	1
you	1
and	1
read	1
it,	1
and	1
you	1
will	1
see	1
that	1
what	1
I	1
have	1
said	1
is	1
true.”	1
“As	1
you	1
will,”	1
said	1
the	1
barber;	1
“but	1
what	1
are	1
we	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
these	1
little	1
books	1
that	1
are	1
left?”	1
“These	1
must	1
be,	1
not	1
chivalry,	1
but	1
poetry,”	1
said	1
the	1
curate;	1
and	1
opening	1
one	1
he	1
saw	1
it	1
was	1
the	1
“Diana”	1
of	1
Jorge	1
de	1
Montemayor,	1
and,	1
supposing	1
all	1
the	1
others	1
to	1
be	1
of	1
the	1
same	1
sort,	1
“these,”	1
he	1
said,	1
“do	1
not	1
deserve	1
to	1
be	1
burned	1
like	1
the	1
others,	1
for	1
they	1
neither	1
do	1
nor	1
can	1
do	1
the	1
mischief	1
the	1
books	1
of	1
chivalry	1
have	1
done,	1
being	1
books	1
of	1
entertainment	1
that	1
can	1
hurt	1
no	1
one.”	1
“Ah,	1
señor!”	1
said	1
the	1
niece,	1
“your	1
worship	1
had	1
better	1
order	1
these	1
to	1
be	1
burned	1
as	1
well	1
as	1
the	1
others;	1
for	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
no	1
wonder	1
if,	1
after	1
being	1
cured	1
of	1
his	1
chivalry	1
disorder,	1
my	1
uncle,	1
by	1
reading	1
these,	1
took	1
a	1
fancy	1
to	1
turn	1
shepherd	1
and	1
range	1
the	1
woods	1
and	1
fields	1
singing	1
and	1
piping;	1
or,	1
what	1
would	1
be	1
still	1
worse,	1
to	1
turn	1
poet,	1
which	1
they	1
say	1
is	1
an	1
incurable	1
and	1
infectious	1
malady.”	1
“The	1
damsel	1
is	1
right,”	1
said	1
the	1
curate,	1
“and	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
well	1
to	1
put	1
this	1
stumbling-block	1
and	1
temptation	1
out	1
of	1
our	1
friend’s	1
way.	1
To	1
begin,	1
then,	1
with	1
the	1
‘Diana’	1
of	1
Montemayor.	1
I	1
am	1
of	1
opinion	1
it	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
burned,	1
but	1
that	1
it	1
should	1
be	1
cleared	1
of	1
all	1
that	1
about	1
the	1
sage	1
Felicia	1
and	1
the	1
magic	1
water,	1
and	1
of	1
almost	1
all	1
the	1
longer	1
pieces	1
of	1
verse:	1
let	1
it	1
keep,	1
and	1
welcome,	1
its	1
prose	1
and	1
the	1
honour	1
of	1
being	1
the	1
first	1
of	1
books	1
of	1
the	1
kind.”	1
“This	1
that	1
comes	1
next,”	1
said	1
the	1
barber,	1
“is	1
the	1
‘Diana,’	1
entitled	1
the	1
‘Second	1
Part,	1
by	1
the	1
Salamancan,’	1
and	1
this	1
other	1
has	1
the	1
same	1
title,	1
and	1
its	1
author	1
is	1
Gil	1
Polo.”	1
“As	1
for	1
that	1
of	1
the	1
Salamancan,”	1
replied	1
the	1
curate,	1
“let	1
it	1
go	1
to	1
swell	1
the	1
number	1
of	1
the	1
condemned	1
in	1
the	1
yard,	1
and	1
let	1
Gil	1
Polo’s	1
be	1
preserved	1
as	1
if	1
it	1
came	1
from	1
Apollo	1
himself:	1
but	1
get	1
on,	1
gossip,	1
and	1
make	1
haste,	1
for	1
it	1
is	1
growing	1
late.”	1
“This	1
book,”	1
said	1
the	1
barber,	1
opening	1
another,	1
“is	1
the	1
ten	1
books	1
of	1
the	1
‘Fortune	1
of	1
Love,’	1
written	1
by	1
Antonio	1
de	1
Lofraso,	1
a	1
Sardinian	1
poet.”	1
“By	1
the	1
orders	1
I	1
have	1
received,”	1
said	1
the	1
curate,	1
“since	1
Apollo	1
has	1
been	1
Apollo,	1
and	1
the	1
Muses	1
have	1
been	1
Muses,	1
and	1
poets	1
have	1
been	1
poets,	1
so	1
droll	1
and	1
absurd	1
a	1
book	1
as	1
this	1
has	1
never	1
been	1
written,	1
and	1
in	1
its	1
way	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
best	1
and	1
the	1
most	1
singular	1
of	1
all	1
of	1
this	1
species	1
that	1
have	1
as	1
yet	1
appeared,	1
and	1
he	1
who	1
has	1
not	1
read	1
it	1
may	1
be	1
sure	1
he	1
has	1
never	1
read	1
what	1
is	1
delightful.	1
Give	1
it	1
here,	1
gossip,	1
for	1
I	1
make	1
more	1
account	1
of	1
having	1
found	1
it	1
than	1
if	1
they	1
had	1
given	1
me	1
a	1
cassock	1
of	1
Florence	1
stuff.”	1
He	1
put	1
it	1
aside	1
with	1
extreme	1
satisfaction,	1
and	1
the	1
barber	1
went	1
on,	1
“These	1
that	1
come	1
next	1
are	1
‘The	1
Shepherd	1
of	1
Iberia,’	1
‘Nymphs	1
of	1
Henares,’	1
and	1
‘The	1
Enlightenment	1
of	1
Jealousy.’”	1
“Then	1
all	1
we	1
have	1
to	1
do,”	1
said	1
the	1
curate,	1
“is	1
to	1
hand	1
them	1
over	1
to	1
the	1
secular	1
arm	1
of	1
the	1
housekeeper,	1
and	1
ask	1
me	1
not	1
why,	1
or	1
we	1
shall	1
never	1
have	1
done.”	1
“This	1
next	1
is	1
the	1
‘Pastor	1
de	1
Fílida.’”	1
“No	1
Pastor	1
that,”	1
said	1
the	1
curate,	1
“but	1
a	1
highly	1
polished	1
courtier;	1
let	1
it	1
be	1
preserved	1
as	1
a	1
precious	1
jewel.”	1
“This	1
large	1
one	1
here,”	1
said	1
the	1
barber,	1
“is	1
called	1
‘The	1
Treasury	1
of	1
various	1
Poems.’”	1
“If	1
there	1
were	1
not	1
so	1
many	1
of	1
them,”	1
said	1
the	1
curate,	1
“they	1
would	1
be	1
more	1
relished:	1
this	1
book	1
must	1
be	1
weeded	1
and	1
cleansed	1
of	1
certain	1
vulgarities	1
which	1
it	1
has	1
with	1
its	1
excellences;	1
let	1
it	1
be	1
preserved	1
because	1
the	1
author	1
is	1
a	1
friend	1
of	1
mine,	1
and	1
out	1
of	1
respect	1
for	1
other	1
more	1
heroic	1
and	1
loftier	1
works	1
that	1
he	1
has	1
written.”	1
“This,”	1
continued	1
the	1
barber,	1
“is	1
the	1
‘Cancionero’	1
of	1
Lopez	1
de	1
Maldonado.”	1
“The	1
author	1
of	1
that	1
book,	1
too,”	1
said	1
the	1
curate,	1
“is	1
a	1
great	1
friend	1
of	1
mine,	1
and	1
his	1
verses	1
from	1
his	1
own	1
mouth	1
are	1
the	1
admiration	1
of	1
all	1
who	1
hear	1
them,	1
for	1
such	1
is	1
the	1
sweetness	1
of	1
his	1
voice	1
that	1
he	1
enchants	1
when	1
he	1
chants	1
them:	1
it	1
gives	1
rather	1
too	1
much	1
of	1
its	1
eclogues,	1
but	1
what	1
is	1
good	1
was	1
never	1
yet	1
plentiful:	1
let	1
it	1
be	1
kept	1
with	1
those	1
that	1
have	1
been	1
set	1
apart.	1
But	1
what	1
book	1
is	1
that	1
next	1
it?”	1
“The	1
‘Galatea’	1
of	1
Miguel	1
de	1
Cervantes,”	1
said	1
the	1
barber.	1
“That	1
Cervantes	1
has	1
been	1
for	1
many	1
years	1
a	1
great	1
friend	1
of	1
mine,	1
and	1
to	1
my	1
knowledge	1
he	1
has	1
had	1
more	1
experience	1
in	1
reverses	1
than	1
in	1
verses.	1
His	1
book	1
has	1
some	1
good	1
invention	1
in	1
it,	1
it	1
presents	1
us	1
with	1
something	1
but	1
brings	1
nothing	1
to	1
a	1
conclusion:	1
we	1
must	1
wait	1
for	1
the	1
Second	1
Part	1
it	1
promises:	1
perhaps	1
with	1
amendment	1
it	1
may	1
succeed	1
in	1
winning	1
the	1
full	1
measure	1
of	1
grace	1
that	1
is	1
now	1
denied	1
it;	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
mean	1
time	1
do	1
you,	1
señor	1
gossip,	1
keep	1
it	1
shut	1
up	1
in	1
your	1
own	1
quarters.”	1
“Very	1
good,”	1
said	1
the	1
barber;	1
“and	1
here	1
come	1
three	1
together,	1
the	1
‘Araucana’	1
of	1
Don	1
Alonso	1
de	1
Ercilla,	1
the	1
‘Austriada’	1
of	1
Juan	1
Rufo,	1
Justice	1
of	1
Cordova,	1
and	1
the	1
‘Montserrate’	1
of	1
Christobal	1
de	1
Virués,	1
the	1
Valencian	1
poet.”	1
“These	1
three	1
books,”	1
said	1
the	1
curate,	1
“are	1
the	1
best	1
that	1
have	1
been	1
written	1
in	1
Castilian	1
in	1
heroic	1
verse,	1
and	1
they	1
may	1
compare	1
with	1
the	1
most	1
famous	1
of	1
Italy;	1
let	1
them	1
be	1
preserved	1
as	1
the	1
richest	1
treasures	1
of	1
poetry	1
that	1
Spain	1
possesses.”	1
The	1
curate	1
was	1
tired	1
and	1
would	1
not	1
look	1
into	1
any	1
more	1
books,	1
and	1
so	1
he	1
decided	1
that,	1
“contents	1
uncertified,”	1
all	1
the	1
rest	1
should	1
be	1
burned;	1
but	1
just	1
then	1
the	1
barber	1
held	1
open	1
one,	1
called	1
“The	1
Tears	1
of	1
Angelica.”	1
“I	1
should	1
have	1
shed	1
tears	1
myself,”	1
said	1
the	1
curate	1
when	1
he	1
heard	1
the	1
title,	1
“had	1
I	1
ordered	1
that	1
book	1
to	1
be	1
burned,	1
for	1
its	1
author	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
famous	1
poets	1
of	1
the	1
world,	1
not	1
to	1
say	1
of	1
Spain,	1
and	1
was	1
very	1
happy	1
in	1
the	1
translation	1
of	1
some	1
of	1
Ovid’s	1
fables.”	1

Full	1
Size	1
At	1
this	1
instant	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
began	1
shouting	1
out,	1
“Here,	1
here,	1
valiant	1
knights!	1
here	1
is	1
need	1
for	1
you	1
to	1
put	1
forth	1
the	1
might	1
of	1
your	1
strong	1
arms,	1
for	1
they	1
of	1
the	1
Court	1
are	1
gaining	1
the	1
mastery	1
in	1
the	1
tourney!”	1
Called	1
away	1
by	1
this	1
noise	1
and	1
outcry,	1
they	1
proceeded	1
no	1
farther	1
with	1
the	1
scrutiny	1
of	1
the	1
remaining	1
books,	1
and	1
so	1
it	1
is	1
thought	1
that	1
“The	1
Carolea,”	1
“The	1
Lion	1
of	1
Spain,”	1
and	1
“The	1
Deeds	1
of	1
the	1
Emperor,”	1
written	1
by	1
Don	1
Luis	1
de	1
Ávila,	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
fire	1
unseen	1
and	1
unheard;	1
for	1
no	1
doubt	1
they	1
were	1
among	1
those	1
that	1
remained,	1
and	1
perhaps	1
if	1
the	1
curate	1
had	1
seen	1
them	1
they	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
undergone	1
so	1
severe	1
a	1
sentence.	1
When	1
they	1
reached	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
he	1
was	1
already	1
out	1
of	1
bed,	1
and	1
was	1
still	1
shouting	1
and	1
raving,	1
and	1
slashing	1
and	1
cutting	1
all	1
round,	1
as	1
wide	1
awake	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
never	1
slept.	1
They	1
closed	1
with	1
him	1
and	1
by	1
force	1
got	1
him	1
back	1
to	1
bed,	1
and	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
become	1
a	1
little	1
calm,	1
addressing	1
the	1
curate,	1
he	1
said	1
to	1
him,	1
“Of	1
a	1
truth,	1
Señor	1
Archbishop	1
Turpin,	1
it	1
is	1
a	1
great	1
disgrace	1
for	1
us	1
who	1
call	1
ourselves	1
the	1
Twelve	1
Peers,	1
so	1
carelessly	1
to	1
allow	1
the	1
knights	1
of	1
the	1
Court	1
to	1
gain	1
the	1
victory	1
in	1
this	1
tourney,	1
we	1
the	1
adventurers	1
having	1
carried	1
off	1
the	1
honour	1
on	1
the	1
three	1
former	1
days.”	1
“Hush,	1
gossip,”	1
said	1
the	1
curate;	1
“please	1
God,	1
the	1
luck	1
may	1
turn,	1
and	1
what	1
is	1
lost	1
to-day	1
may	1
be	1
won	1
to-morrow;	1
for	1
the	1
present	1
let	1
your	1
worship	1
have	1
a	1
care	1
of	1
your	1
health,	1
for	1
it	1
seems	1
to	1
me	1
that	1
you	1
are	1
over-fatigued,	1
if	1
not	1
badly	1
wounded.”	1
“Wounded	1
no,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“but	1
bruised	1
and	1
battered	1
no	1
doubt,	1
for	1
that	1
bastard	1
Don	1
Roland	1
has	1
cudgelled	1
me	1
with	1
the	1
trunk	1
of	1
an	1
oak	1
tree,	1
and	1
all	1
for	1
envy,	1
because	1
he	1
sees	1
that	1
I	1
alone	1
rival	1
him	1
in	1
his	1
achievements.	1
But	1
I	1
should	1
not	1
call	1
myself	1
Reinaldos	1
of	1
Montalvan	1
did	1
he	1
not	1
pay	1
me	1
for	1
it	1
in	1
spite	1
of	1
all	1
his	1
enchantments	1
as	1
soon	1
as	1
I	1
rise	1
from	1
this	1
bed.	1
For	1
the	1
present	1
let	1
them	1
bring	1
me	1
something	1
to	1
eat,	1
for	1
that,	1
I	1
feel,	1
is	1
what	1
will	1
be	1
more	1
to	1
my	1
purpose,	1
and	1
leave	1
it	1
to	1
me	1
to	1
avenge	1
myself.”	1
They	1
did	1
as	1
he	1
wished;	1
they	1
gave	1
him	1
something	1
to	1
eat,	1
and	1
once	1
more	1
he	1
fell	1
asleep,	1
leaving	1
them	1
marvelling	1
at	1
his	1
madness.	1
That	1
night	1
the	1
housekeeper	1
burned	1
to	1
ashes	1
all	1
the	1
books	1
that	1
were	1
in	1
the	1
yard	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
whole	1
house;	1
and	1
some	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
consumed	1
that	1
deserved	1
preservation	1
in	1
everlasting	1
archives,	1
but	1
their	1
fate	1
and	1
the	1
laziness	1
of	1
the	1
examiner	1
did	1
not	1
permit	1
it,	1
and	1
so	1
in	1
them	1
was	1
verified	1
the	1
proverb	1
that	1
the	1
innocent	1
suffer	1
for	1
the	1
guilty.	1
One	1
of	1
the	1
remedies	1
which	1
the	1
curate	1
and	1
the	1
barber	1
immediately	1
applied	1
to	1
their	1
friend’s	1
disorder	1
was	1
to	1
wall	1
up	1
and	1
plaster	1
the	1
room	1
where	1
the	1
books	1
were,	1
so	1
that	1
when	1
he	1
got	1
up	1
he	1
should	1
not	1
find	1
them	1
(possibly	1
the	1
cause	1
being	1
removed	1
the	1
effect	1
might	1
cease),	1
and	1
they	1
might	1
say	1
that	1
a	1
magician	1
had	1
carried	1
them	1
off,	1
room	1
and	1
all;	1
and	1
this	1
was	1
done	1
with	1
all	1
despatch.	1
Two	1
days	1
later	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
got	1
up,	1
and	1
the	1
first	1
thing	1
he	1
did	1
was	1
to	1
go	1
and	1
look	1
at	1
his	1
books,	1
and	1
not	1
finding	1
the	1
room	1
where	1
he	1
had	1
left	1
it,	1
he	1
wandered	1
from	1
side	1
to	1
side	1
looking	1
for	1
it.	1
He	1
came	1
to	1
the	1
place	1
where	1
the	1
door	1
used	1
to	1
be,	1
and	1
tried	1
it	1
with	1
his	1
hands,	1
and	1
turned	1
and	1
twisted	1
his	1
eyes	1
in	1
every	1
direction	1
without	1
saying	1
a	1
word;	1
but	1
after	1
a	1
good	1
while	1
he	1
asked	1
his	1
housekeeper	1
whereabouts	1
was	1
the	1
room	1
that	1
held	1
his	1
books.	1
The	1
housekeeper,	1
who	1
had	1
been	1
already	1
well	1
instructed	1
in	1
what	1
she	1
was	1
to	1
answer,	1
said,	1
“What	1
room	1
or	1
what	1
nothing	1
is	1
it	1
that	1
your	1
worship	1
is	1
looking	1
for?	1
There	1
are	1
neither	1
room	1
nor	1
books	1
in	1
this	1
house	1
now,	1
for	1
the	1
devil	1
himself	1
has	1
carried	1
all	1
away.”	1
“It	1
was	1
not	1
the	1
devil,”	1
said	1
the	1
niece,	1
“but	1
a	1
magician	1
who	1
came	1
on	1
a	1
cloud	1
one	1
night	1
after	1
the	1
day	1
your	1
worship	1
left	1
this,	1
and	1
dismounting	1
from	1
a	1
serpent	1
that	1
he	1
rode	1
he	1
entered	1
the	1
room,	1
and	1
what	1
he	1
did	1
there	1
I	1
know	1
not,	1
but	1
after	1
a	1
little	1
while	1
he	1
made	1
off,	1
flying	1
through	1
the	1
roof,	1
and	1
left	1
the	1
house	1
full	1
of	1
smoke;	1
and	1
when	1
we	1
went	1
to	1
see	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
we	1
saw	1
neither	1
book	1
nor	1
room:	1
but	1
we	1
remember	1
very	1
well,	1
the	1
housekeeper	1
and	1
I,	1
that	1
on	1
leaving,	1
the	1
old	1
villain	1
said	1
in	1
a	1
loud	1
voice	1
that,	1
for	1
a	1
private	1
grudge	1
he	1
owed	1
the	1
owner	1
of	1
the	1
books	1
and	1
the	1
room,	1
he	1
had	1
done	1
mischief	1
in	1
that	1
house	1
that	1
would	1
be	1
discovered	1
by-and-by:	1
he	1
said	1
too	1
that	1
his	1
name	1
was	1
the	1
Sage	1
Muñaton.”	1
“He	1
must	1
have	1
said	1
Friston,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote.	1
“I	1
don’t	1
know	1
whether	1
he	1
called	1
himself	1
Friston	1
or	1
Friton,”	1
said	1
the	1
housekeeper,	1
“I	1
only	1
know	1
that	1
his	1
name	1
ended	1
with	1
‘ton.’”	1
“So	1
it	1
does,”	1
said	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“and	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
sage	1
magician,	1
a	1
great	1
enemy	1
of	1
mine,	1
who	1
has	1
a	1
spite	1
against	1
me	1
because	1
he	1
knows	1
by	1
his	1
arts	1
and	1
lore	1
that	1
in	1
process	1
of	1
time	1
I	1
am	1
to	1
engage	1
in	1
single	1
combat	1
with	1
a	1
knight	1
whom	1
he	1
befriends	1
and	1
that	1
I	1
am	1
to	1
conquer,	1
and	1
he	1
will	1
be	1
unable	1
to	1
prevent	1
it;	1
and	1
for	1
this	1
reason	1
he	1
endeavours	1
to	1
do	1
me	1
all	1
the	1
ill	1
turns	1
that	1
he	1
can;	1
but	1
I	1
promise	1
him	1
it	1
will	1
be	1
hard	1
for	1
him	1
to	1
oppose	1
or	1
avoid	1
what	1
is	1
decreed	1
by	1
Heaven.”	1
“Who	1
doubts	1
that?”	1
said	1
the	1
niece;	1
“but,	1
uncle,	1
who	1
mixes	1
you	1
up	1
in	1
these	1
quarrels?	1
Would	1
it	1
not	1
be	1
better	1
to	1
remain	1
at	1
peace	1
in	1
your	1
own	1
house	1
instead	1
of	1
roaming	1
the	1
world	1
looking	1
for	1
better	1
bread	1
than	1
ever	1
came	1
of	1
wheat,	1
never	1
reflecting	1
that	1
many	1
go	1
for	1
wool	1
and	1
come	1
back	1
shorn?”	1
“Oh,	1
niece	1
of	1
mine,”	1
replied	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
“how	1
much	1
astray	1
art	1
thou	1
in	1
thy	1
reckoning:	1
ere	1
they	1
shear	1
me	1
I	1
shall	1
have	1
plucked	1
away	1
and	1
stripped	1
off	1
the	1
beards	1
of	1
all	1
who	1
dare	1
to	1
touch	1
only	1
the	1
tip	1
of	1
a	1
hair	1
of	1
mine.”	1
The	1
two	1
were	1
unwilling	1
to	1
make	1
any	1
further	1
answer,	1
as	1
they	1
saw	1
that	1
his	1
anger	1
was	1
kindling.	1
In	1
short,	1
then,	1
he	1
remained	1
at	1
home	1
fifteen	1
days	1
very	1
quietly	1
without	1
showing	1
any	1
signs	1
of	1
a	1
desire	1
to	1
take	1
up	1
with	1
his	1
former	1
delusions,	1
and	1
during	1
this	1
time	1
he	1
held	1
lively	1
discussions	1
with	1
his	1
two	1
gossips,	1
the	1
curate	1
and	1
the	1
barber,	1
on	1
the	1
point	1
he	1
maintained,	1
that	1
knights-errant	1
were	1
what	1
the	1
world	1
stood	1
most	1
in	1
need	1
of,	1
and	1
that	1
in	1
him	1
was	1
to	1
be	1
accomplished	1
the	1
revival	1
of	1
knight-errantry.	1
The	1
curate	1
sometimes	1
contradicted	1
him,	1
sometimes	1
agreed	1
with	1
him,	1
for	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
observed	1
this	1
precaution	1
he	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
unable	1
to	1
bring	1
him	1
to	1
reason.	1
Meanwhile	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
worked	1
upon	1
a	1
farm	1
labourer,	1
a	1
neighbour	1
of	1
his,	1
an	1
honest	1
man	1
(if	1
indeed	1
that	1
title	1
can	1
be	1
given	1
to	1
him	1
who	1
is	1
poor),	1
but	1
with	1
very	1
little	1
wit	1
in	1
his	1
pate.	1
In	1
a	1
word,	1
he	1
so	1
talked	1
him	1
over,	1
and	1
with	1
such	1
persuasions	1
and	1
promises,	1
that	1
the	1
poor	1
clown	1
made	1
up	1
his	1
mind	1
to	1
sally	1
forth	1
with	1
him	1
and	1
serve	1
him	1
as	1
esquire.	1
Don	1
Quixote,	1
among	1
other	1
things,	1
told	1
him	1
he	1
ought	1
to	1
be	1
ready	1
to	1
go	1
with	1
him	1
gladly,	1
because	1
any	1
moment	1
an	1
adventure	1
might	1
occur	1
that	1
might	1
win	1
an	1
island	1
in	1
the	1
twinkling	1
of	1
an	1
eye	1
and	1
leave	1
him	1
governor	1
of	1
it.	1
On	1
these	1
and	1
the	1
like	1
promises	1
Sancho	1
Panza	1
(for	1
so	1
the	1
labourer	1
was	1
called)	1
left	1
wife	1
and	1
children,	1
and	1
engaged	1
himself	1
as	1
esquire	1
to	1
his	1
neighbour.	1

Don	1
Quixote	1
next	1
set	1
about	1
getting	1
some	1
money;	1
and	1
selling	1
one	1
thing	1
and	1
pawning	1
another,	1
and	1
making	1
a	1
bad	1
bargain	1
in	1
every	1
case,	1
he	1
got	1
together	1
a	1
fair	1
sum.	1
He	1
provided	1
himself	1
with	1
a	1
buckler,	1
which	1
he	1
begged	1
as	1
a	1
loan	1
from	1
a	1
friend,	1
and,	1
restoring	1
his	1
battered	1
helmet	1
as	1
best	1
he	1
could,	1
he	1
warned	1
his	1
squire	1
Sancho	1
of	1
the	1
day	1
and	1
hour	1
he	1
meant	1
to	1
set	1
out,	1
that	1
he	1
might	1
provide	1
himself	1
with	1
what	1
he	1
thought	1
most	1
needful.	1
Above	1
all,	1
he	1
charged	1
him	1
to	1
take	1
alforjas	1
with	1
him.	1
The	1
other	1
said	1
he	1
would,	1
and	1
that	1
he	1
meant	1
to	1
take	1
also	1
a	1
very	1
good	1
ass	1
he	1
had,	1
as	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
much	1
given	1
to	1
going	1
on	1
foot.	1
About	1
the	1
ass,	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
hesitated	1
a	1
little,	1
trying	1
whether	1
he	1
could	1
call	1
to	1
mind	1
any	1
knight-errant	1
taking	1
with	1
him	1
an	1
esquire	1
mounted	1
on	1
ass-back,	1
but	1
no	1
instance	1
occurred	1
to	1
his	1
memory.	1
For	1
all	1
that,	1
however,	1
he	1
determined	1
to	1
take	1
him,	1
intending	1
to	1
furnish	1
him	1
with	1
a	1
more	1
honourable	1
mount	1
when	1
a	1
chance	1
of	1
it	1
presented	1
itself,	1
by	1
appropriating	1
the	1
horse	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
discourteous	1
knight	1
he	1
encountered.	1
Himself	1
he	1
provided	1
with	1
shirts	1
and	1
such	1
other	1
things	1
as	1
he	1
could,	1
according	1
to	1
the	1
advice	1
the	1
host	1
had	1
given	1
him;	1
all	1
which	1
being	1
done,	1
without	1
taking	1
leave,	1
Sancho	1
Panza	1
of	1
his	1
wife	1
and	1
children,	1
or	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
of	1
his	1
housekeeper	1
and	1
niece,	1
they	1
sallied	1
forth	1
unseen	1
by	1
anybody	1
from	1
the	1
village	1
one	1
night,	1
and	1
made	1
such	1
good	1
way	1
in	1
the	1
course	1
of	1
it	1
that	1
by	1
daylight	1
they	1
held	1
themselves	1
safe	1
from	1
discovery,	1
even	1
should	1
search	1
be	1
made	1
for	1
them.	1
Sancho	1
rode	1
on	1
his	1
ass	1
like	1
a	1
patriarch,	1
with	1
his	1
alforjas	1
and	1
bota,	1
and	1
longing	1
to	1
see	1
himself	1
soon	1
governor	1
of	1
the	1
island	1
his	1
master	1
had	1
promised	1
him.	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
decided	1
upon	1
taking	1
the	1
same	1
route	1
and	1
road	1
he	1
had	1
taken	1
on	1
his	1
first	1
journey,	1
that	1
over	1
the	1
Campo	1
de	1
Montiel,	1
which	1
he	1
travelled	1
with	1
less	1
discomfort	1
than	1
on	1
the	1
last	1
occasion,	1
for,	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
early	1
morning	1
and	1
the	1
rays	1
of	1
the	1
sun	1
fell	1
on	1
them	1
obliquely,	1
the	1
heat	1
did	1
not	1
distress	1
them.	1
And	1
now	1
said	1
Sancho	1
Panza	1
to	1
his	1
master,	1
“Your	1
worship	1
will	1
take	1
care,	1
Señor	1
Knight-errant,	1
not	1
to	1
forget	1
about	1
the	1
island	1
you	1
have	1
promised	1
me,	1
for	1
be	1
it	1
ever	1
so	1
big	1
I’ll	1
be	1
equal	1
to	1
governing	1
it.”	1
To	1
which	1
Don	1
Quixote	1
replied,	1
“Thou	1
must	1
know,	1
friend	1
Sancho	1
Panza,	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
practice	1
very	1
much	1
in	1
vogue	1
with	1
the	1
knights-errant	1
of	1
old	1
to	1
make	1
their	1
squires	1
governors	1
of	1
the	1
islands	1
or	1
kingdoms	1
they	1

I	1
am	1
determined	1
that	1
there	1
shall	1
be	1
no	1
failure	1
on	1
my	1
part	1
in	1
so	1
liberal	1
a	1
custom;	1
on	1
the	1
contrary,	1
I	1
mean	1
to	1
improve	1
upon	1
it,	1
for	1
they	1
sometimes,	1
and	1
perhaps	1
most	1
frequently,	1
waited	1
until	1
their	1
squires	1
were	1
old,	1
and	1
then	1
when	1
they	1
had	2
enough	2
of	2
service	2
and	2
hard	2
days	2
and	2
worse	2
nights,	2
they	2
gave	2
them	2
some	2
title	2
or	2
other,	2
of	2
count,	2
or	2
at	2
the	2
most	2
marquis,	2
of	2
some	2
valley	2
or	2
province	2
more	2
or	2
less;	2
but	2
if	2
thou	2
livest	2
and	2
I	2
live,	2
it	2
may	2
well	2
be	2
that	2
before	2
six	2
days	2
are	2
over,	2
I	2
may	2
have	2
won	2
some	2
kingdom	2
that	2
has	2
others	2
dependent	2
upon	2
it,	2
which	2
will	2
be	2
just	2
the	2
thing	2
to	2
enable	2
thee	2
to	2
be	2
crowned	2
king	2
of	2
one	2
of	2
them.	2
Nor	2
needst	2
thou	2
count	2
this	2
wonderful,	2
for	2
things	2
and	2
chances	2
fall	2
to	2
the	2
lot	2
of	2
such	2
knights	2
in	2
ways	2
so	2
unexampled	2
and	2
unexpected	2
that	2
I	2
might	2
easily	2
give	2
thee	2
even	2
more	2
than	2
I	2
promise	2
thee.”	2
“In	2
that	2
case,”	2
said	2
Sancho	2
Panza,	2
“if	2
I	2
should	2
become	2
a	2
king	2
by	2
one	2
of	2
those	2
miracles	2
your	2
worship	2
speaks	2
of,	2
even	2
Juana	2
Gutierrez,	2
my	2
old	2
woman,	2
would	2
come	2
to	2
be	2
queen	2
and	2
my	2
children	2
infantes.”	2
“Well,	2
who	2
doubts	2
it?”	2
said	2
Don	2
Quixote.	2
“I	2
doubt	2
it,”	2
replied	2
Sancho	2
Panza,	2
“because	2
for	2
my	2
part	2
I	2
am	2
persuaded	2
that	2
though	2
God	2
should	2
shower	2
down	2
kingdoms	2
upon	2
earth,	2
not	2
one	2
of	2
them	2
would	2
fit	2
the	2
head	2
of	2
Mari	2
Gutierrez.	2
Let	2
me	2
tell	2
you,	2
señor,	2
she	2
is	2
not	2
worth	2
two	2
maravedis	2
for	2
a	2
queen;	2
countess	2
will	2
fit	2
her	2
better,	2
and	2
that	2
only	2
with	2
God’s	2
help.”	2
“Leave	2
it	2
to	2
God,	2
Sancho,”	2
returned	2
Don	2
Quixote,	2
“for	2
he	2
will	2
give	2
her	2
what	2
suits	2
her	2
best;	2
but	2
do	2
not	2
undervalue	2
thyself	2
so	2
much	2
as	2
to	2
come	2
to	2
be	2
content	2
with	2
anything	2
less	2
than	2
being	2
governor	2
of	2
a	2
province.”	2
“I	2
will	2
not,	2
señor,”	2
answered	2
Sancho,	2
“specially	2
as	2
I	2
have	2
a	2
man	2
of	2
such	2
quality	2
for	2
a	2
master	2
in	2
your	2
worship,	2
who	2
will	2
know	2
how	2
to	2
give	2
me	2
all	2
that	2
will	2
be	2
suitable	2
for	2
me	2
and	2
that	2
I	2
can	2
bear.”	2

At	2
this	2
point	2
they	2
came	2
in	2
sight	2
of	2
thirty	2
or	2
forty	2
windmills	2
that	2
there	2
are	2
on	2
that	2
plain,	2
and	2
as	2
soon	2
as	2
Don	2
Quixote	2
saw	2
them	2
he	2
said	2
to	2
his	2
squire,	2
“Fortune	2
is	2
arranging	2
matters	2
for	2
us	2
better	2
than	2
we	2
could	2
have	2
shaped	2
our	2
desires	2
ourselves,	2
for	2
look	2
there,	2
friend	2
Sancho	2
Panza,	2
where	2
thirty	2
or	2
more	2
monstrous	2
giants	2
present	2
themselves,	2
all	2
of	2
whom	2
I	2
mean	2
to	2
engage	2
in	2
battle	2
and	2
slay,	2
and	2
with	2
whose	2
spoils	2
we	2
shall	2
begin	2
to	2
make	2
our	2
fortunes;	2
for	2
this	2
is	2
righteous	2
warfare,	2
and	2
it	2
is	2
God’s	2
good	2
service	2
to	2
sweep	2
so	2
evil	2
a	2
breed	2
from	2
off	2
the	2
face	2
of	2
the	2
earth.”	2
“What	2
giants?”	2
said	2
Sancho	2
Panza.	2
“Those	2
thou	2
seest	2
there,”	2
answered	2
his	2
master,	2
“with	2
the	2
long	2
arms,	2
and	2
some	2
have	2
them	2
nearly	2
two	2
leagues	2
long.”	2
“Look,	2
your	2
worship,”	2
said	2
Sancho;	2
“what	2
we	2
see	2
there	2
are	2
not	2
giants	2
but	2
windmills,	2
and	2
what	2
seem	2
to	2
be	2
their	2
arms	2
are	2
the	2
sails	2
that	2
turned	2
by	2
the	2
wind	2
make	2
the	2
millstone	2
go.”	2
“It	2
is	2
easy	2
to	2
see,”	2
replied	2
Don	2
Quixote,	2
“that	2
thou	2
art	2
not	2
used	2
to	2
this	2
business	2
of	2
adventures;	2
those	2
are	2
giants;	2
and	2
if	2
thou	2
art	2
afraid,	2
away	2
with	2
thee	2
out	2
of	2
this	2
and	2
betake	2
thyself	2
to	2
prayer	2
while	2
I	2
engage	2
them	2
in	2
fierce	2
and	2
unequal	2
combat.”	2
So	2
saying,	2
he	2
gave	2
the	2
spur	2
to	2
his	2
steed	2
Rocinante,	2
heedless	2
of	2
the	2
cries	2
his	2
squire	2
Sancho	2
sent	2
after	2
him,	2
warning	2
him	2
that	2
most	2
certainly	2
they	2
were	2
windmills	2
and	2
not	2
giants	2
he	2
was	2
going	2
to	2
attack.	2
He,	2
however,	2
was	2
so	2
positive	2
they	2
were	2
giants	2
that	2
he	2
neither	2
heard	2
the	2
cries	2
of	2
Sancho,	2
nor	2
perceived,	2
near	2
as	2
he	2
was,	2
what	2
they	2
were,	2
but	2
made	2
at	2
them	2
shouting,	2
“Fly	2
not,	2
cowards	2
and	2
vile	2
beings,	2
for	2
a	2
single	2
knight	2
attacks	2
you.”	2
A	2
slight	2
breeze	2
at	2
this	2
moment	2
sprang	2
up,	2
and	2
the	2
great	2
sails	2
began	2
to	2
move,	2
seeing	2
which	2
Don	2
Quixote	2
exclaimed,	2
“Though	2
ye	2
flourish	2
more	2
arms	2
than	2
the	2
giant	2
Briareus,	2
ye	2
have	2
to	2
reckon	2
with	2
me.”	2
So	2
saying,	2
and	2
commending	2
himself	2
with	2
all	2
his	2
heart	2
to	2
his	2
lady	2
Dulcinea,	2
imploring	2
her	2
to	2
support	2
him	2
in	2
such	2
a	2
peril,	2
with	2
lance	2
in	2
rest	2
and	2
covered	2
by	2
his	2
buckler,	2
he	2
charged	2
at	2
Rocinante’s	2
fullest	2
gallop	2
and	2
fell	2
upon	2
the	2
first	2
mill	2
that	2
stood	2
in	2
front	2
of	2
him;	2
but	2
as	2
he	2
drove	2
his	2
lance-point	2
into	2
the	2
sail	2
the	2
wind	2
whirled	2
it	2
round	2
with	2
such	2
force	2
that	2
it	2
shivered	2
the	2
lance	2
to	2
pieces,	2
sweeping	2
with	2
it	2
horse	2
and	2
rider,	2
who	2
went	2
rolling	2
over	2
on	2
the	2
plain,	2
in	2
a	2
sorry	2
condition.	2
Sancho	2
hastened	2
to	2
his	2
assistance	2
as	2
fast	2
as	2
his	2
ass	2
could	2
go,	2
and	2
when	2
he	2
came	2
up	2
found	2
him	2
unable	2
to	2
move,	2
with	2
such	2
a	2
shock	2
had	2
Rocinante	2
fallen	2
with	2
him.	2

“God	2
bless	2
me!”	2
said	2
Sancho,	2
“did	2
I	2
not	2
tell	2
your	2
worship	2
to	2
mind	2
what	2
you	2
were	2
about,	2
for	2
they	2
were	2
only	2
windmills?	2
and	2
no	2
one	2
could	2
have	2
made	2
any	2
mistake	2
about	2
it	2
but	2
one	2
who	2

something	2

kind	2
in	2
his	2
head.”	2
“Hush,	2
friend	2
Sancho,”	2
replied	2
Don	2
Quixote,	2
“the	2
fortunes	2
of	2
war	2
more	2
than	2
any	2
other	2
are	2
liable	2
to	2
frequent	2
fluctuations;	2
and	2
moreover	2
I	2
think,	2
and	2
it	2
is	2
the	2
truth,	2
that	3
same	3
sage	3
Friston	3
who	3
carried	3
off	3
my	3
study	3
and	3
books,	3
has	3
turned	3
these	3
giants	3
into	3
mills	3
in	3
order	3
to	3
rob	3
me	3
of	3
the	3
glory	3
of	3
vanquishing	3
them,	3
such	3
is	3
the	3
enmity	3
he	3
bears	3
me;	3
but	3
in	3
the	3
end	3
his	3
wicked	3
arts	3
will	3
avail	3
but	3
little	3
against	3
my	3
good	3
sword.”	3

“God	3
order	3
it	3
as	3
he	3
may,”	3
said	3
Sancho	3
Panza,	3
and	3
helping	3
him	3
to	3
rise	3
got	3
him	3
up	3
again	3
on	3
Rocinante,	3
whose	3
shoulder	3
was	3
half	3
out;	3
and	3
then,	3
discussing	3
the	3
late	3
adventure,	3
they	3
followed	3
the	3
road	3
to	3
Puerto	3
Lapice,	3
for	3
there,	3
said	3
Don	3
Quixote,	3
they	3
could	3
not	3
fail	3
to	3
find	3
adventures	3
in	3
abundance	3
and	3
variety,	3
as	3
it	3
was	3
a	3
great	3
thoroughfare.	3
For	3
all	3
that,	3
he	3
was	3
much	3
grieved	3
at	3
the	3
loss	3
of	3
his	3
lance,	3
and	3
saying	3
so	3
to	3
his	3
squire,	3
he	3
added,	3
“I	3
remember	3
having	3
read	3
how	3
a	3
Spanish	3
knight,	3
Diego	3
Perez	3
de	3
Vargas	3
by	3
name,	3
having	3
broken	3
his	3
sword	3
in	3
battle,	3
tore	3
from	3
an	3
oak	3
a	3
ponderous	3
bough	3
or	3
branch,	3
and	3
with	3
it	3
did	3
such	3
things	3
that	3
day,	3
and	3
pounded	3
so	3
many	3
Moors,	3
that	3
he	3
got	3
the	3
surname	3
of	3
Machuca,	3
and	3
he	3
and	3
his	3
descendants	3
from	3
that	3
day	3
forth	3
were	3
called	3
Vargas	3
y	3
Machuca.	3
I	3
mention	3
this	3
because	3
from	3
the	3
first	3
oak	3
I	3
see	3
I	3
mean	3
to	3
rend	3
such	3
another	3
branch,	3
large	3
and	3
stout	3
like	3
that,	3
with	3
which	3
I	3
am	3
determined	3
and	3
resolved	3
to	3
do	3
such	3
deeds	3
that	3
thou	3
mayest	3
deem	3
thyself	3
very	3
fortunate	3
in	3
being	3
found	3
worthy	3
to	3
come	3
and	3
see	3
them,	3
and	3
be	3
an	3
eyewitness	3
of	3
things	3
that	3
will	3
with	3
difficulty	3
be	3
believed.”	3
“Be	3
that	3
as	3
God	3
will,”	3
said	3
Sancho,	3
“I	3
believe	3
it	3
all	3
as	3
your	3
worship	3
says	3
it;	3
but	3
straighten	3
yourself	3
a	3
little,	3
for	3
you	3
seem	3
all	3
on	3
one	3
side,	3
may	3
be	3
from	3
the	3
shaking	3
of	3
the	3
fall.”	3
“That	3
is	3
the	3
truth,”	3
said	3
Don	3
Quixote,	3
“and	3
if	3
I	3
make	3
no	3
complaint	3
of	3
the	3
pain	3
it	3
is	3
because	3
knights-errant	3
are	3
not	3
permitted	3
to	3
complain	3
of	3
any	3
wound,	3
even	3
though	3
their	3
bowels	3
be	3
coming	3
out	3
through	3
it.”	3
“If	3
so,”	3
said	3
Sancho,	3
“I	3
have	3
nothing	3
to	3
say;	3
but	3
God	3
knows	3
I	3
would	3
rather	3
your	3
worship	3
complained	3
when	3
anything	3
ailed	3
you.	3
For	3
my	3
part,	3
I	3
confess	3
I	3
must	3
complain	3
however	3
small	3
the	3
ache	3
may	3
be;	3
unless	3
this	3
rule	3
about	3
not	3
complaining	3
extends	3
to	3
the	3
squires	3
of	3
knights-errant	3
also.”	3
Don	3
Quixote	3
could	3
not	3
help	3
laughing	3
at	3
his	3
squire’s	3
simplicity,	3
and	3
he	3
assured	3
him	3
he	3
might	3
complain	3
whenever	3
and	3
however	3
he	3
chose,	3
just	3
as	3
he	3
liked,	3
for,	3
so	3
far,	3
he	3
had	3
never	3
read	3
of	3
anything	3
to	3
the	3
contrary	3
in	3
the	3
order	3
of	3
knighthood.	3
Sancho	3
bade	3
him	3
remember	3
it	3
was	3
dinner-time,	3
to	3
which	3
his	3
master	3
answered	3
that	3
he	3
wanted	3
nothing	3
himself	3
just	3
then,	3
but	3
that	3
_he_	3
might	3
eat	3
when	3
he	3
had	3
a	3
mind.	3
With	3
this	3
permission	3
Sancho	3
settled	3
himself	3
as	3
comfortably	3
as	3
he	3
could	3
on	3
his	3
beast,	3
and	3
taking	3
out	3
of	3
the	3
alforjas	3
what	3
he	3
had	3
stowed	3
away	3
in	3
them,	3
he	3
jogged	3
along	3
behind	3
his	3
master	3
munching	3
deliberately,	3
and	3
from	3
time	3
to	3
time	3
taking	3
a	3
pull	3
at	3
the	3
bota	3
with	3
a	3
relish	3
that	3
the	3
thirstiest	3
tapster	3
in	3
Malaga	3
might	3
have	3
envied;	3
and	3
while	3
he	3
went	3
on	3
in	3
this	3
way,	3
gulping	3
down	3
draught	3
after	3
draught,	3
he	3
never	3
gave	3
a	3
thought	3
to	3
any	3
of	3
the	3
promises	3
his	3
master	3
had	3
made	3
him,	3
nor	3
did	3
he	3
rate	3
it	3
as	3
hardship	3
but	3
rather	3
as	3
recreation	3
going	3
in	3
quest	3
of	3
adventures,	3
however	3
dangerous	3
they	3
might	3
be.	3
Finally	3
they	3
passed	3
the	3
night	3
among	3
some	3
trees,	3
from	3
one	3
of	3
which	3
Don	3
Quixote	3
plucked	3
a	3
dry	3
branch	3
to	3
serve	3
him	3
after	3
a	3
fashion	3
as	3
a	3
lance,	3
and	3
fixed	3
on	3
it	3
the	3
head	3
he	3
had	3
removed	3
from	3
the	3
broken	3
one.	3
All	3
that	3
night	3
Don	3
Quixote	3
lay	3
awake	3
thinking	3
of	3
his	3
lady	3
Dulcinea,	3
in	3
order	3
to	3
conform	3
to	3
what	3
he	3
had	3
read	3
in	3
his	3
books,	3
how	3
many	3
a	3
night	3
in	3
the	3
forests	3
and	3
deserts	3
knights	3
used	3
to	3
lie	3
sleepless	3
supported	3
by	3
the	3
memory	3
of	3
their	3
mistresses.	3
Not	3
so	3
did	3
Sancho	3
Panza	3
spend	3
it,	3
for	3
having	3
his	3
stomach	3
full	3
of	3
something	3
stronger	3
than	3
chicory	3
water	3
he	3
made	3
but	3
one	3
sleep	3
of	3
it,	3
and,	3
if	3
his	3
master	3
had	3
not	3
called	3
him,	3
neither	3
the	3
rays	3
of	3
the	3
sun	3
beating	3
on	3
his	3
face	3
nor	3
all	3
the	3
cheery	3
notes	3
of	3
the	3
birds	3
welcoming	3
the	3
approach	3
of	3
day	3
would	3
have	3
had	3
power	3
to	3
waken	3
him.	3
On	3
getting	3
up	3
he	3
tried	3
the	3
bota	3
and	3
found	3
it	3
somewhat	3
less	3
full	3
than	3
the	3
night	3
before,	3
which	3
grieved	3
his	3
heart	3
because	3
they	3
did	3
not	3
seem	3
to	3
be	3
on	3
the	3
way	3
to	3
remedy	3
the	3
deficiency	3
readily.	3
Don	3
Quixote	3
did	3
not	3
care	3
to	3
break	3
his	3
fast,	3
for,	3
as	3
has	3
been	3
already	3
said,	3
he	3
confined	3
himself	3
to	3
savoury	3
recollections	3
for	3
nourishment.	3
They	3
returned	3
to	3
the	3
road	3
they	3
had	3
set	3
out	3
with,	3
leading	3
to	3
Puerto	3
Lapice,	3
and	3
at	3
three	3
in	3
the	3
afternoon	3
they	3
came	3
in	3
sight	3
of	3
it.	3
“Here,	3
brother	3
Sancho	3
Panza,”	3
said	3
Don	3
Quixote	3
when	3
he	3
saw	3
it,	3
“we	3
may	3
plunge	3
our	3
hands	3
up	3
to	3
the	3
elbows	3
in	3
what	3
they	3
call	3
adventures;	3
but	3
observe,	3
even	3
shouldst	3
thou	3
see	3
me	3
in	3
the	3
greatest	3
danger	3
in	3
the	3
world,	3
thou	3
must	3
not	3
put	3
a	3
hand	3
to	3
thy	3
sword	3
in	3
my	3
defence,	3
unless	3
indeed	3
thou	3
perceivest	3
that	3
those	3
who	3
assail	3
me	3
are	3
rabble	3
or	3
base	3
folk;	3
for	3
in	3
that	3
case	3
thou	3
mayest	3
very	3
properly	3
aid	3
me;	3
but	3
if	3
they	3
be	3
knights	3
it	3
is	3
on	3
no	3
account	3
permitted	3
or	3
allowed	3
thee	3
by	3
the	3
laws	3
of	3
knighthood	3
to	3
help	3
me	3
until	3
thou	3
hast	3
been	3
dubbed	3
a	3
knight.”	3
“Most	3
certainly,	3
señor,”	3
replied	3
Sancho,	3
“your	3
worship	3
shall	3
be	3
fully	3
obeyed	3
in	3
this	3
matter;	3
all	3
the	3
more	3
as	3
of	3
myself	3
I	3
am	3
peaceful	3
and	3
no	3
friend	3
to	3
mixing	3
in	3
strife	3
and	3
quarrels:	3
it	3
is	3
true	3
that	3
as	3
regards	3
the	3
defence	3
of	3
my	3
own	3
person	3
I	3
shall	3
not	3
give	3
much	3
heed	3
to	3
those	3
laws,	3
for	3
laws	3
human	3
and	3
divine	3
allow	3
each	3
one	3
to	3
defend	3
himself	3
against	3
any	3
assailant	3
whatever.”	3
“That	3
I	3
grant,”	3
said	3
Don	3
Quixote,	3
“but	3
in	3
this	3
matter	3
of	3
aiding	3
me	3
against	3
knights	3
thou	3
must	3
put	3
a	3
restraint	3
upon	3
thy	3
natural	3
impetuosity.”	3
“I	3
will	3
do	3
so,	3
I	3
promise	3
you,”	3
answered	3
Sancho,	3
“and	3
will	3
keep	3
this	3
precept	3
as	3
carefully	3
as	3
Sunday.”	3
While	3
they	3
were	3
thus	3
talking	3
there	3
appeared	3
on	3
the	3
road	3
two	3
friars	3
of	3
the	3
order	3
of	3
St.	3
Benedict,	3
mounted	3
on	3
two	3
dromedaries,	3
for	3
not	3
less	3
tall	3
were	3
the	3
two	3
mules	3
they	3
rode	3
on.	3
They	3
wore	3
travelling	3
spectacles	3
and	3
carried	3
sunshades;	3
and	3
behind	3
them	3
came	3
a	3
coach	3
attended	3
by	3
four	3
or	3
five	3
persons	3
on	3
horseback	3
and	3
two	3
muleteers	3
on	3
foot.	3
In	3
the	3
coach	3
there	3
was,	3
as	3
afterwards	3
appeared,	3
a	3
Biscay	3
lady	3
on	3
her	3
way	3
to	3
Seville,	3
where	3
her	3
husband	3
was	3
about	3
to	3
take	3
passage	3
for	3
the	3
Indies	3
with	3
an	3
appointment	3
of	3
high	3
honour.	3
The	3
friars,	3
though	3
going	3
the	3
same	3
road,	3
were	3
not	3
in	3
her	3
company;	3
but	3
the	3
moment	3
Don	3
Quixote	3
perceived	3
them	3
he	3
said	3
to	3
his	3
squire,	3
“Either	3
I	3
am	3
mistaken,	3
or	3
this	3
is	3
going	3
to	3
be	3
the	3
most	3
famous	3
adventure	3
that	3
has	3
ever	3
been	3
seen,	3
for	3
those	3
black	3
bodies	3
we	3
see	3
there	3
must	3
be,	3
and	3
doubtless	3
are,	3
magicians	3
who	3
are	3
carrying	3
off	3
some	3
stolen	3
princess	3
in	3
that	3
coach,	3
and	3
with	3
all	3
my	3
might	3
I	3
must	3
undo	3
this	3
wrong.”	3
“This	3
will	3
be	3
worse	3
than	3
the	3
windmills,”	3
said	3
Sancho.	3
“Look,	3
señor;	3
those	3
are	3
friars	3
of	3
St.	3
Benedict,	3
and	3
the	3
coach	3
plainly	3
belongs	3
to	3
some	3
travellers:	3
I	3
tell	3
you	3
to	3
mind	3
well	3
what	3
you	3
are	3
about	3
and	3
don’t	3
let	3
the	3
devil	3
mislead	3
you.”	3
“I	3
have	3
told	3
thee	3
already,	3
Sancho,”	3
replied	3
Don	3
Quixote,	3
“that	3
on	3
the	3
subject	3
of	3
adventures	3
thou	3
knowest	3
little.	3
What	3
I	3
say	3
is	3
the	3
truth,	3
as	3
thou	3
shalt	3
see	3
presently.”	3
So	3
saying,	3
he	3
advanced	3
and	3
posted	3
himself	3
in	3
the	3
middle	3
of	3
the	3
road	3
along	3
which	3
the	3
friars	3
were	3
coming,	3
and	3
as	3
soon	3
as	3
he	3
thought	3
they	3
had	3
come	3
near	3
enough	3
to	3
hear	3
what	3
he	3
said,	3
he	3
cried	3
aloud,	3
“Devilish	3
and	3
unnatural	3
beings,	3
release	3
instantly	3
the	3
highborn	3
princesses	3
whom	3
you	3
are	3
carrying	3
off	3
by	3
force	3
in	3
this	3
coach,	3
else	3
prepare	3
to	3
meet	3
a	3
speedy	3
death	3
as	3
the	3
just	3
punishment	3
of	3
your	3
evil	3
deeds.”	3
The	3
friars	3
drew	3
rein	3
and	3
stood	3
wondering	3
at	3
the	3
appearance	3
of	3
Don	3
Quixote	3
as	3
well	3
as	3
at	3
his	3
words,	3
to	3
which	3
they	3
replied,	3
“Señor	3
Caballero,	3
we	3
are	3
not	3
devilish	3
or	3
unnatural,	3
but	3
two	3
brothers	3
of	3
St.	3
Benedict	3
following	3
our	3
road,	3
nor	3
do	3
we	3
know	3
whether	3
or	3
not	3
there	3
are	3
any	3
captive	3
princesses	3
coming	3
in	3
this	3
coach.”	3
“No	3
soft	3
words	3
with	3
me,	3
for	3
I	3
know	3
you,	3
lying	3
rabble,”	3
said	3
Don	3
Quixote,	3
and	3
without	3
waiting	3
for	3
a	3
reply	3
he	3
spurred	3
Rocinante	3
and	3
with	3
levelled	3
lance	3
charged	3
the	3
first	3
friar	3
with	3
such	3
fury	3
and	3
determination,	3
that,	3
if	3
the	3
friar	3
had	3
not	3
flung	3
himself	3
off	3
the	3
mule,	3
he	3
would	3
have	3
brought	3
him	3
to	3
the	3
ground	3
against	3
his	3
will,	3
and	3
sore	3
wounded,	3
if	3
not	3
killed	3
outright.	3
The	3
second	3
brother,	3
seeing	3
how	3
his	3
comrade	3
was	3
treated,	3
drove	3
his	3
heels	3
into	3
his	3
castle	3
of	3
a	3
mule	3
and	3
made	3
off	3
across	3
the	3
country	3
faster	3
than	3
the	3
wind.	3
Sancho	3
Panza,	3
when	3
he	3
saw	3
the	3
friar	3
on	3
the	3
ground,	3
dismounting	3
briskly	3
from	3
his	3
ass,	3
rushed	3
towards	3
him	3
and	3
began	3
to	3
strip	3
off	3
his	3
gown.	3
At	3
that	3
instant	3
the	3
friars	3
muleteers	3
came	3
up	3
and	3
asked	3
what	3
he	3
was	3
stripping	3
him	3
for.	3
Sancho	3
answered	3
them	3
that	3
this	3
fell	3
to	3
him	3
lawfully	3
as	3
spoil	3
of	3
the	3
battle	3
which	3
his	3
lord	3
Don	3
Quixote	3
had	3
won.	3
The	3
muleteers,	3
who	3
had	3
no	3
idea	3
of	3
a	3
joke	3
and	3
did	3
not	3
understand	3
all	3
this	3
about	3
battles	3
and	3
spoils,	3
seeing	3
that	3
Don	3
Quixote	3
was	3
some	3
distance	3
off	3
talking	3
to	3
the	3
travellers	3
in	3
the	3
coach,	3
fell	3
upon	3
Sancho,	3
knocked	3
him	3
down,	3
and	3
leaving	3
hardly	3
a	3
hair	3
in	3
his	3
beard,	3
belaboured	3
him	3
with	3
kicks	3
and	3
left	3
him	3
stretched	3
breathless	3
and	3
senseless	3
on	3
the	3
ground;	3
and	3
without	3
any	3
more	3
delay	3
helped	3
the	3
friar	3
to	3
mount,	3
who,	3
trembling,	3
terrified,	3
and	3
pale,	3
as	3
soon	3
as	3
he	3
found	3
himself	3
in	3
the	3
saddle,	3
spurred	3
after	3
his	3
companion,	3
who	3
was	3
standing	3
at	3
a	3
distance	3
looking	3
on,	3
watching	3
the	3
result	3
of	3
the	3
onslaught;	3
then,	3
not	3
caring	3
to	3
wait	3
for	3
the	3
end	3
of	3
the	3
affair	3
just	3
begun,	3
they	3
pursued	3
their	3
journey	3
making	3
more	3
crosses	3
than	3
if	3
they	3
had	3
the	3
devil	3
after	3
them.	3
Don	3
Quixote	3
was,	3
as	3
has	3
been	3
said,	3
speaking	3
to	3
the	3
lady	3
in	3
the	3
coach:	3
“Your	3
beauty,	3
lady	3
mine,”	3
said	3
he,	3
“may	3
now	3
dispose	3
of	3
your	3
person	3
as	3
may	3
be	3
most	3
in	3
accordance	3
with	3
your	3
pleasure,	3
for	3
the	3
pride	3
of	3
your	3
ravishers	3
lies	3
prostrate	3
on	3
the	3
ground	3
through	3
this	3
strong	3
arm	3
of	3
mine;	3
and	3
lest	3
you	3
should	3
be	3
pining	3
to	3
know	3
the	3
name	3
of	3
your	3
deliverer,	3
know	3
that	3
I	3
am	3
called	3
Don	3
Quixote	3
of	3
La	3
Mancha,	3
knight-errant	3
and	3
adventurer,	3
and	3
captive	3
to	3
the	3
peerless	3
and	3
beautiful	3
lady	3
Dulcinea	3
del	3
Toboso:	3
and	3
in	3
return	3
for	3
the	3
service	3
you	3
have	3
received	3
of	3
me	3
I	3
ask	3
no	3
more	3
than	3
that	3
you	3
should	3
return	3
to	3
El	3
Toboso,	3
and	3
on	3
my	3
behalf	3
present	3
yourself	3
before	3
that	3
lady	3
and	3
tell	3
her	3
what	3
I	3
have	3
done	3
to	3
set	3
you	3
free.”	3
One	3
of	3
the	3
squires	3
in	3
attendance	3
upon	3
the	3
coach,	3
a	3
Biscayan,	3
was	3
listening	3
to	3
all	3
Don	3
Quixote	3
was	3
saying,	3
and,	3
perceiving	3
that	3
he	3
would	3
not	3
allow	3
the	3
coach	3
to	3
go	3
on,	3
but	3
was	3
saying	3
it	3
must	3
return	3
at	3
once	3
to	3
El	3
Toboso,	3
he	3
made	3
at	3
him,	3
and	3
seizing	3
his	3
lance	3
addressed	3
him	3
in	3
bad	3
Castilian	3
and	3
worse	3
Biscayan	3
after	3
his	3
fashion,	3
“Begone,	3
caballero,	3
and	3
ill	3
go	3
with	3
thee;	3
by	3
the	3
God	3
that	3
made	3
me,	3
unless	3
thou	3
quittest	3
coach,	3
slayest	3
thee	3
as	3
art	3
here	3
a	3
Biscayan.”	3
Don	3
Quixote	3
understood	3
him	3
quite	3
well,	3
and	3
answered	3
him	3
very	3
quietly,	3
“If	3
thou	3
wert	3
a	3
knight,	3
as	3
thou	3
art	3
none,	3
I	3
should	3
have	3
already	3
chastised	3
thy	3
folly	3
and	3
rashness,	3
miserable	3
creature.”	3
To	3
which	3
the	3
Biscayan	3
returned,	3
“I	3
no	3
gentleman!—I	3
swear	3
to	3
God	3
thou	3
liest	3
as	3
I	3
am	3
Christian:	3
if	3
thou	3
droppest	3
lance	3
and	3
drawest	3
sword,	3
soon	3
shalt	3
thou	3
see	3
thou	3
art	3
carrying	3
water	3
to	3
the	3
cat:	3
Biscayan	3
on	3
land,	3
hidalgo	3
at	3
sea,	3
hidalgo	3
at	3
the	3
devil,	3
and	3
look,	3
if	3
thou	3
sayest	3
otherwise	3
thou	3
liest.”	3
“‘“You	3
will	3
see	3
presently,”	3
said	3
Agrajes,’”	3
replied	3
Don	3
Quixote;	3
and	3
throwing	3
his	3
lance	3
on	3
the	3
ground	3
he	3
drew	3
his	3
sword,	3
braced	3
his	3
buckler	3
on	3
his	3
arm,	3
and	3
attacked	3
the	3
Biscayan,	3
bent	3
upon	3
taking	3
his	3
life.	3
The	3
Biscayan,	3
when	3
he	3
saw	3
him	3
coming	3
on,	3
though	3
he	3
wished	3
to	3
dismount	3
from	3
his	3
mule,	3
in	3
which,	3
being	3
one	3
of	3
those	3
sorry	3
ones	3
let	3
out	3
for	3
hire,	3
he	3
had	3
no	3
confidence,	3
had	3
no	3
choice	3
but	3
to	3
draw	3
his	3
sword;	3
it	3
was	3
lucky	3
for	3
him,	3
however,	3
that	3
he	3
was	3
near	3
the	3
coach,	3
from	3
which	3
he	3
was	3
able	3
to	3
snatch	3
a	3
cushion	3
that	3
served	3
him	3
for	3
a	3
shield;	3
and	3
they	3
went	3
at	3
one	3
another	3
as	3
if	3
they	3
had	3
been	3
two	3
mortal	3
enemies.	3
The	3
others	3
strove	3
to	3
make	3
peace	3
between	3
them,	3
but	3
could	3
not,	3
for	3
the	3
Biscayan	3
declared	3
in	3
his	3
disjointed	3
phrase	3
that	3
if	3
they	3
did	3
not	3
let	3
him	3
finish	3
his	3
battle	3
he	3
would	3
kill	3
his	3
mistress	3
and	3
everyone	3
that	3
strove	3
to	3
prevent	3
him.	3
The	3
lady	3
in	3
the	3
coach,	3
amazed	3
and	3
terrified	3
at	3
what	3
she	3
saw,	3
ordered	3
the	3
coachman	3
to	3
draw	3
aside	3
a	3
little,	3
and	3
set	3
herself	3
to	3
watch	3
this	3
severe	3
struggle,	3
in	3
the	3
course	3
of	3
which	3
the	3
Biscayan	3
smote	3
Don	3
Quixote	3
a	3
mighty	3
stroke	3
on	3
the	3
shoulder	3
over	3
the	3
top	3
of	3
his	3
buckler,	3
which,	3
given	3
to	3
one	3
without	3
armour,	3
would	3
have	3
cleft	3
him	3
to	3
the	3
waist.	3
Don	3
Quixote,	3
feeling	3
the	3
weight	3
of	3
this	3
prodigious	3
blow,	3
cried	3
aloud,	3
saying,	3
“O	3
lady	3
of	3
my	3
soul,	3
Dulcinea,	3
flower	3
of	3
beauty,	3
come	3
to	3
the	3
aid	3
of	3
this	3
your	3
knight,	3
who,	3
in	3
fulfilling	3
his	3
obligations	3
to	3
your	3
beauty,	3
finds	3
himself	3
in	3
this	3
extreme	3
peril.”	3
To	3
say	3
this,	3
to	3
lift	3
his	3
sword,	3
to	3
shelter	3
himself	3
well	3
behind	3
his	3
buckler,	3
and	3
to	3
assail	3
the	3
Biscayan	3
was	3
the	3
work	3
of	3
an	3
instant,	3
determined	3
as	3
he	3
was	3
to	3
venture	3
all	3
upon	3
a	3
single	3
blow.	3
The	3
Biscayan,	3
seeing	3
him	3
come	3
on	3
in	3
this	3
way,	3
was	3
convinced	3
of	3
his	3
courage	3
by	3
his	3
spirited	3
bearing,	3
and	3
resolved	3
to	3
follow	3
his	3
example,	3
so	3
he	3
waited	3
for	3
him	3
keeping	3
well	3
under	3
cover	3
of	3
his	3
cushion,	3
being	3
unable	3
to	3
execute	3
any	3
sort	3
of	3
manoeuvre	3
with	3
his	3
mule,	3
which,	3
dead	3
tired	3
and	3
never	3
meant	3
for	3
this	3
kind	3
of	3
game,	3
could	3
not	3
stir	3
a	3
step.	3
On,	3
then,	3
as	3
aforesaid,	3
came	3
Don	3
Quixote	3
against	3
the	3
wary	3
Biscayan,	3
with	3
uplifted	3
sword	3
and	3
a	3
firm	3
intention	3
of	3
splitting	3
him	3
in	3
half,	3
while	3
on	3
his	3
side	3
the	3
Biscayan	3
waited	3
for	3
him	3
sword	3
in	3
hand,	3
and	3
under	3
the	3
protection	3
of	3
his	3
cushion;	3
and	3
all	3
present	3
stood	3
trembling,	3
waiting	3
in	3
suspense	3
the	3
result	3
of	3
blows	3
such	3
as	3
threatened	3
to	3
fall,	3
and	3
the	3
lady	3
in	3
the	3
coach	3
and	3
the	3
rest	3
of	3
her	3
following	3
were	3
making	3
a	3
thousand	3
vows	3
and	3
offerings	3
to	3
all	3
the	3
images	3
and	3
shrines	3
of	3
Spain,	3
that	3
God	3
might	3
deliver	3
her	3
squire	3
and	3
all	3
of	3
them	3
from	3
this	3
great	3
peril	3
in	3
which	3
they	3
found	3
themselves.	3
But	3
it	3
spoils	3
all,	3
that	3
at	3
this	3
point	3
and	3
crisis	3
the	3
author	3
of	3
the	3
history	3
leaves	3
this	3
battle	3
impending,	3
giving	3
as	3
excuse	3
that	3
he	3
could	3
find	3
nothing	3
more	3
written	3
about	3
these	3
achievements	3
of	3
Don	3
Quixote	3
than	3
what	3
has	3
been	3
already	3
set	3
forth.	3
It	3
is	3
true	3
the	3
second	3
author	3
of	3
this	3
work	3
was	3
unwilling	3
to	3
believe	3
that	3
a	3
history	3
so	3
curious	3
could	3
have	3
been	3
allowed	3
to	3
fall	3
under	3
the	3
sentence	3
of	3
oblivion,	3
or	3
that	3
the	3
wits	3
of	3
La	3
Mancha	3
could	3
have	3
been	3
so	3
undiscerning	3
as	3
not	3
to	3
preserve	3
in	3
their	3
archives	3
or	3
registries	3
some	3
documents	3
referring	3
to	3
this	3
famous	3
knight;	3
and	3
this	3
being	3
his	3
persuasion,	3
he	3
did	3
not	3
despair	3
of	3
finding	3
the	3
conclusion	3
of	3
this	3
pleasant	3
history,	3
which,	3
heaven	3
favouring	3
him,	3
he	3
did	3
find	3
in	3
a	3
way	3
that	3
shall	3
be	3
related	3
in	3
the	3
Second	3
Part.	3

In	3
the	3
First	3
Part	3
of	3
this	3
history	3
we	3
left	3
the	3
valiant	3
Biscayan	3
and	3
the	3
renowned	3
Don	3
Quixote	3
with	3
drawn	3
swords	3
uplifted,	3
ready	3
to	3
deliver	3
two	3
such	3
furious	3
slashing	3
blows	3
that	3
if	3
they	3
had	3
fallen	3
full	3
and	3
fair	3
they	3
would	3
at	3
least	3
have	3
split	3
and	3
cleft	3
them	3
asunder	3
from	3
top	3
to	3
toe	3
and	3
laid	3
them	3
open	3
like	3
a	3
pomegranate;	3
and	3
at	3
this	3
so	3
critical	3
point	3
the	3
delightful	3
history	3
came	3
to	3
a	3
stop	3
and	3
stood	3
cut	3
short	3
without	3
any	3
intimation	3
from	3
the	3
author	3
where	3
what	3
was	3
missing	3
was	3
to	3
be	3
found.	3
This	3
distressed	3
me	3
greatly,	3
because	3
the	3
pleasure	3
derived	3
from	3
having	3
read	3
such	3
a	3
small	3
portion	3
turned	3
to	3
vexation	3
at	3
the	3
thought	3
of	3
the	3
poor	3
chance	3
that	3
presented	3
itself	3
of	3
finding	3
the	3
large	3
part	3
that,	3
so	3
it	3
seemed	3
to	3
me,	3
was	3
missing	3
of	3
such	3
an	3
interesting	3
tale.	3
It	3
appeared	3
to	3
me	3
to	3
be	3
a	3
thing	3
impossible	3
and	3
contrary	3
to	3
all	3
precedent	3
that	3
so	3
good	3
a	3
knight	3
should	3
have	3
been	3
without	3
some	3
sage	3
to	3
undertake	3
the	3
task	3
of	3
writing	3
his	3
marvellous	3
achievements;	3
a	3
thing	3
that	3
was	3
never	3
wanting	3
to	3
any	3
of	3
those	3
knights-errant	3
who,	3
they	3
say,	3
went	3
after	3
adventures;	3
for	3
every	3
one	3
of	3
them	3
had	3
one	3
or	3
two	3
sages	3
as	3
if	3
made	3
on	3
purpose,	3
who	3
not	3
only	3
recorded	3
their	3
deeds	3
but	3
described	3
their	3
most	3
trifling	3
thoughts	3
and	3
follies,	3
however	3
secret	3
they	3
might	3
be;	3
and	3
such	3
a	3
good	3
knight	3
could	3
not	3
have	3
been	3
so	3
unfortunate	3
as	3
not	3
to	3
have	3
what	3
Platir	3
and	3
others	3
like	3
him	3
had	3
in	3
abundance.	3
And	3
so	3
I	3
could	3
not	3
bring	3
myself	3
to	3
believe	3
that	3
such	3
a	3
gallant	3
tale	3
had	3
been	3
left	3
maimed	3
and	3
mutilated,	3
and	3
I	3
laid	3
the	3
blame	3
on	3
Time,	3
the	3
devourer	3
and	3
destroyer	3
of	3
all	3
things,	3
that	3
had	3
either	3
concealed	3
or	3
consumed	3
it.	3
On	3
the	3
other	3
hand,	3
it	3
struck	3
me	3
that,	3
inasmuch	3
as	3
among	3
his	3
books	3
there	3
had	3
been	3
found	3
such	3
modern	3
ones	3
as	3
“The	3
Enlightenment	3
of	3
Jealousy”	3
and	3
the	3
“Nymphs	3
and	3
Shepherds	3
of	3
Henares,”	3
his	3
story	3
must	3
likewise	3
be	3
modern,	3
and	3
that	3
though	3
it	3
might	3
not	3
be	3
written,	3
it	3
might	3
exist	3
in	3
the	3
memory	3
of	3
the	3
people	3
of	3
his	3
village	3
and	3
of	3
those	3
in	3
the	3
neighbourhood.	3
This	3
reflection	3
kept	3
me	3
perplexed	3
and	3
longing	3
to	3
know	3
really	3
and	3
truly	3
the	3
whole	3
life	3
and	3
wondrous	3
deeds	3
of	3
our	3
famous	3
Spaniard,	3
Don	3
Quixote	3
of	3
La	3
Mancha,	3
light	3
and	3
mirror	3
of	3
Manchegan	3
chivalry,	3
and	3
the	3
first	3
that	3
in	3
our	3
age	3
and	3
in	3
these	3
so	3
evil	3
days	3
devoted	3
himself	3
to	3
the	3
labour	3
and	3
exercise	3
of	3
the	3
arms	3
of	3
knight-errantry,	3
righting	3
wrongs,	3
succouring	3
widows,	3
and	3
protecting	3
damsels	3
of	3
that	3
sort	3
that	3
used	3
to	3
ride	3
about,	3
whip	3
in	3
hand,	3
on	3
their	3
palfreys,	3
with	3
all	3
their	3
virginity	3
about	3
them,	3
from	3
mountain	3
to	3
mountain	3
and	3
valley	3
to	3
valley—for,	3
if	3
it	3
were	3
not	3
for	3
some	3
ruffian,	3
or	3
boor	3
with	3
a	3
hood	3
and	3
hatchet,	3
or	3
monstrous	3
giant,	3
that	3
forced	3
them,	3
there	3
were	3
in	3
days	3
of	3
yore	3
damsels	3
that	3
at	3
the	3
end	3
of	3
eighty	3
years,	3
in	3
all	3
which	3
time	3
they	3
had	3
never	3
slept	3
a	3
day	3
under	3
a	3
roof,	3
went	3
to	3
their	3
graves	3
as	3
much	3
maids	3
as	3
the	3
mothers	3
that	3
bore	3
them.	3
I	3
say,	3
then,	3
that	3
in	3
these	3
and	3
other	3
respects	3
our	3
gallant	3
Don	3
Quixote	3
is	3
worthy	3
of	3
everlasting	3
and	3
notable	3
praise,	3
nor	3
should	3
it	3
be	3
withheld	3
even	3
from	3
me	3
for	3
the	3
labour	3
and	3
pains	3
spent	3
in	3
searching	3
for	3
the	3
conclusion	3
of	3
this	3
delightful	3
history;	3
though	3
I	3
know	3
well	3
that	3
if	3
Heaven,	3
chance	3
and	3
good	3
fortune	3
had	3
not	3
helped	3
me,	3
the	3
world	3
would	3
have	3
remained	3
deprived	3
of	3
an	3
entertainment	3
and	3
pleasure	3
that	3
for	3
a	3
couple	3
of	3
hours	3
or	3
so	3
may	3
well	3
occupy	3
him	3
who	3
shall	3
read	3
it	3
attentively.	3
The	3
discovery	3
of	3
it	3
occurred	3
in	3
this	3
way.	3
One	3
day,	3
as	3
I	3
was	3
in	3
the	3
Alcana	3
of	3
Toledo,	3
a	3
boy	3
came	3
up	3
to	3
sell	3
some	3
pamphlets	3
and	3
old	3
papers	3
to	3
a	3
silk	3
mercer,	3
and,	3
as	3
I	3
am	3
fond	3
of	3
reading	3
even	3
the	3
very	3
scraps	3
of	3
paper	3
in	3
the	3
streets,	3
led	3
by	3
this	3
natural	3
bent	3
of	3
mine	3
I	3
took	3
up	3
one	3
of	3
the	3
pamphlets	3
the	3
boy	3
had	3
for	3
sale,	3
and	3
saw	3
that	3
it	3
was	3
in	3
characters	3
which	3
I	3
recognised	3
as	3
Arabic,	3
and	3
as	3
I	3
was	3
unable	3
to	3
read	3
them	3
though	3
I	3
could	3
recognise	3
them,	3
I	3
looked	3
about	3
to	3
see	3
if	3
there	3
were	3
any	3
Spanish-speaking	3
Morisco	3
at	3
hand	3
to	3
read	3
them	3
for	3
me;	3
nor	3
was	3
there	3
any	3
great	3
difficulty	3
in	3
finding	3
such	3
an	3
interpreter,	3
for	3
even	3
had	3
I	3
sought	3
one	3
for	3
an	3
older	3
and	3
better	3
language	3
I	3
should	3
have	3
found	3
him.	3
In	3
short,	3
chance	3
provided	3
me	3
with	3
one,	3
who	3
when	3
I	3
told	3
him	3
what	3
I	3
wanted	3
and	3
put	3
the	3
book	3
into	3
his	3
hands,	3
opened	3
it	3
in	3
the	3
middle	3
and	3
after	3
reading	3
a	3
little	3
in	3
it	3
began	3
to	3
laugh.	3
I	3
asked	3
him	3
what	3
he	3
was	3
laughing	3
at,	3
and	3
he	3
replied	3
that	3
it	3
was	3
at	3
something	3
the	3
book	3
had	3
written	3
in	3
the	3
margin	3
by	3
way	3
of	3
a	3
note.	3
I	3
bade	3
him	3
tell	3
it	3
to	3
me;	3
and	3
he	3
still	3
laughing	3
said,	3
“In	3
the	3
margin,	3
as	3
I	3
told	3
you,	3
this	3
is	3
written:	3
‘_This	3
Dulcinea	3
del	3
Toboso	3
so	3
often	3
mentioned	3
in	3
this	3
history,	3
had,	3
they	3
say,	3
the	3
best	3
hand	3
of	3
any	3
woman	3
in	3
all	3
La	3
Mancha	3
for	3
salting	3
pigs_.’”	3
When	3
I	3
heard	3
Dulcinea	3
del	3
Toboso	3
named,	3
I	3
was	3
struck	3
with	3
surprise	3
and	3
amazement,	3
for	3
it	3
occurred	3
to	3
me	3
at	3
once	3
that	3
these	3
pamphlets	3
contained	3
the	3
history	3
of	3
Don	3
Quixote.	3
With	3
this	3
idea	3
I	3
pressed	3
him	3
to	3
read	3
the	3
beginning,	3
and	3
doing	3
so,	3
turning	3
the	3
Arabic	3
offhand	3
into	3
Castilian,	3
he	3
told	3
me	3
it	3
meant,	3
“_History	3
of	3
Don	3
Quixote	3
of	3
La	3
Mancha,	3
written	3
by	3
Cid	3
Hamete	3
Benengeli,	3
an	3
Arab	3
historian_.”	3
It	3
required	3
great	3
caution	3
to	3
hide	3
the	3
joy	3
I	3
felt	3
when	3
the	3
title	3
of	3
the	3
book	3
reached	3
my	3
ears,	3
and	3
snatching	3
it	3
from	3
the	3
silk	3
mercer,	3
I	3
bought	3
all	3
the	3
papers	3
and	3
pamphlets	3
from	3
the	3
boy	3
for	3
half	3
a	3
real;	3
and	3
if	3
he	3
had	4
his	4
wits	4
about	4
him	4
and	4
had	4
known	4
how	4
eager	4
I	4
was	4
for	4
them,	4
he	4
might	4
have	4
safely	4
calculated	4
on	4
making	4
more	4
than	4
six	4
reals	4
by	4
the	4
bargain.	4
I	4
withdrew	4
at	4
once	4
with	4
the	4
Morisco	4
into	4
the	4
cloister	4
of	4
the	4
cathedral,	4
and	4
begged	4
him	4
to	4
turn	4
all	4
these	4
pamphlets	4
that	4
related	4
to	4
Don	4
Quixote	4
into	4
the	4
Castilian	4
tongue,	4
without	4
omitting	4
or	4
adding	4
anything	4
to	4
them,	4
offering	4
him	4
whatever	4
payment	4
he	4
pleased.	4
He	4
was	4
satisfied	4
with	4
two	4
arrobas	4
of	4
raisins	4
and	4
two	4
bushels	4
of	4
wheat,	4
and	4
promised	4
to	4
translate	4
them	4
faithfully	4
and	4
with	4
all	4
despatch;	4
but	4
to	4
make	4
the	4
matter	4
easier,	4
and	4
not	4
to	4
let	4
such	4
a	4
precious	4
find	4
out	4
of	4
my	4
hands,	4
I	4
took	4
him	4
to	4
my	4
house,	4
where	4
in	4
little	4
more	4
than	4
a	4
month	4
and	4
a	4
half	4
he	4
translated	4
the	4
whole	4
just	4
as	4
it	4
is	4
set	4
down	4
here.	4
In	4
the	4
first	4
pamphlet	4
the	4
battle	4
between	4
Don	4
Quixote	4
and	4
the	4
Biscayan	4
was	4
drawn	4
to	4
the	4
very	4
life,	4
they	4
planted	4
in	4
the	4
same	4
attitude	4
as	4
the	4
history	4
describes,	4
their	4
swords	4
raised,	4
and	4
the	4
one	4
protected	4
by	4
his	4
buckler,	4
the	4
other	4
by	4
his	4
cushion,	4
and	4
the	4
Biscayan’s	4
mule	4
so	4
true	4
to	4
nature	4
that	4
it	4
could	4
be	4
seen	4
to	4
be	4
a	4
hired	4
one	4
a	4
bowshot	4
off.	4
The	4
Biscayan	4
had	4
an	4
inscription	4
under	4
his	4
feet	4
which	4
said,	4
“_Don	4
Sancho	4
de	4
Azpeitia_,”	4
which	4
no	4
doubt	4
must	4
have	4
been	4
his	4
name;	4
and	4
at	4
the	4
feet	4
of	4
Rocinante	4
was	4
another	4
that	4
said,	4
“_Don	4
Quixote_.”	4
Rocinante	4
was	4
marvellously	4
portrayed,	4
so	4
long	4
and	4
thin,	4
so	4
lank	4
and	4
lean,	4
with	4
so	4
much	4
backbone	4
and	4
so	4
far	4
gone	4
in	4
consumption,	4
that	4
he	4
showed	4
plainly	4
with	4
what	4
judgment	4
and	4
propriety	4
the	4
name	4
of	4
Rocinante	4
had	4
been	4
bestowed	4
upon	4
him.	4
Near	4
him	4
was	4
Sancho	4
Panza	4
holding	4
the	4
halter	4
of	4
his	4
ass,	4
at	4
whose	4
feet	4
was	4
another	4
label	4
that	4
said,	4
“Sancho	4
Zancas,”	4
and	4
according	4
to	4
the	4
picture,	4
he	4
must	4
have	4
had	4
a	4
big	4
belly,	4
a	4
short	4
body,	4
and	4
long	4
shanks,	4
for	4
which	4
reason,	4
no	4
doubt,	4
the	4
names	4
of	4
Panza	4
and	4
Zancas	4
were	4
given	4
him,	4
for	4
by	4
these	4
two	4
surnames	4
the	4
history	4
several	4
times	4
calls	4
him.	4
Some	4
other	4
trifling	4
particulars	4
might	4
be	4
mentioned,	4
but	4
they	4
are	4
all	4
of	4
slight	4
importance	4
and	4
have	4
nothing	4
to	4
do	4
with	4
the	4
true	4
relation	4
of	4
the	4
history;	4
and	4
no	4
history	4
can	4
be	4
bad	4
so	4
long	4
as	4
it	4
is	4
true.	4
If	4
against	4
the	4
present	4
one	4
any	4
objection	4
be	4
raised	4
on	4
the	4
score	4
of	4
its	4
truth,	4
it	4
can	4
only	4
be	4
that	4
its	4
author	4
was	4
an	4
Arab,	4
as	4
lying	4
is	4
a	4
very	4
common	4
propensity	4
with	4
those	4
of	4
that	4
nation;	4
though,	4
as	4
they	4
are	4
such	4
enemies	4
of	4
ours,	4
it	4
is	4
conceivable	4
that	4
there	4
were	4
omissions	4
rather	4
than	4
additions	4
made	4
in	4
the	4
course	4
of	4
it.	4
And	4
this	4
is	4
my	4
own	4
opinion;	4
for,	4
where	4
he	4
could	4
and	4
should	4
give	4
freedom	4
to	4
his	4
pen	4
in	4
praise	4
of	4
so	4
worthy	4
a	4
knight,	4
he	4
seems	4
to	4
me	4
deliberately	4
to	4
pass	4
it	4
over	4
in	4
silence;	4
which	4
is	4
ill	4
done	4
and	4
worse	4
contrived,	4
for	4
it	4
is	4
the	4
business	4
and	4
duty	4
of	4
historians	4
to	4
be	4
exact,	4
truthful,	4
and	4
wholly	4
free	4
from	4
passion,	4
and	4
neither	4
interest	4
nor	4
fear,	4
hatred	4
nor	4
love,	4
should	4
make	4
them	4
swerve	4
from	4
the	4
path	4
of	4
truth,	4
whose	4
mother	4
is	4
history,	4
rival	4
of	4
time,	4
storehouse	4
of	4
deeds,	4
witness	4
for	4
the	4
past,	4
example	4
and	4
counsel	4
for	4
the	4
present,	4
and	4
warning	4
for	4
the	4
future.	4
In	4
this	4
I	4
know	4
will	4
be	4
found	4
all	4
that	4
can	4
be	4
desired	4
in	4
the	4
pleasantest,	4
and	4
if	4
it	4
be	4
wanting	4
in	4
any	4
good	4
quality,	4
I	4
maintain	4
it	4
is	4
the	4
fault	4
of	4
its	4
hound	4
of	4
an	4
author	4
and	4
not	4
the	4
fault	4
of	4
the	4
subject.	4
To	4
be	4
brief,	4
its	4
Second	4
Part,	4
according	4
to	4
the	4
translation,	4
began	4
in	4
this	4
way:	4
With	4
trenchant	4
swords	4
upraised	4
and	4
poised	4
on	4
high,	4
it	4
seemed	4
as	4
though	4
the	4
two	4
valiant	4
and	4
wrathful	4
combatants	4
stood	4
threatening	4
heaven,	4
and	4
earth,	4
and	4
hell,	4
with	4
such	4
resolution	4
and	4
determination	4
did	4
they	4
bear	4
themselves.	4
The	4
fiery	4
Biscayan	4
was	4
the	4
first	4
to	4
strike	4
a	4
blow,	4
which	4
was	4
delivered	4
with	4
such	4
force	4
and	4
fury	4
that	4
had	4
not	4
the	4
sword	4
turned	4
in	4
its	4
course,	4
that	4
single	4
stroke	4
would	4
have	4
sufficed	4
to	4
put	4
an	4
end	4
to	4
the	4
bitter	4
struggle	4
and	4
to	4
all	4
the	4
adventures	4
of	4
our	4
knight;	4
but	4
that	4
good	4
fortune	4
which	4
reserved	4
him	4
for	4
greater	4
things,	4
turned	4
aside	4
the	4
sword	4
of	4
his	4
adversary,	4
so	4
that	4
although	4
it	4
smote	4
him	4
upon	4
the	4
left	4
shoulder,	4
it	4
did	4
him	4
no	4
more	4
harm	4
than	4
to	4
strip	4
all	4
that	4
side	4
of	4
its	4
armour,	4
carrying	4
away	4
a	4
great	4
part	4
of	4
his	4
helmet	4
with	4
half	4
of	4
his	4
ear,	4
all	4
which	4
with	4
fearful	4
ruin	4
fell	4
to	4
the	4
ground,	4
leaving	4
him	4
in	4
a	4
sorry	4
plight.	4
Good	4
God!	4
Who	4
is	4
there	4
that	4
could	4
properly	4
describe	4
the	4
rage	4
that	4
filled	4
the	4
heart	4
of	4
our	4
Manchegan	4
when	4
he	4
saw	4
himself	4
dealt	4
with	4
in	4
this	4
fashion?	4
All	4
that	4
can	4
be	4
said	4
is,	4
it	4
was	4
such	4
that	4
he	4
again	4
raised	4
himself	4
in	4
his	4
stirrups,	4
and,	4
grasping	4
his	4
sword	4
more	4
firmly	4
with	4
both	4
hands,	4
he	4
came	4
down	4
on	4
the	4
Biscayan	4
with	4
such	4
fury,	4
smiting	4
him	4
full	4
over	4
the	4
cushion	4
and	4
over	4
the	4
head,	4
that—even	4
so	4
good	4
a	4
shield	4
proving	4
useless—as	4
if	4
a	4
mountain	4
had	4
fallen	4
on	4
him,	4
he	4
began	4
to	4
bleed	4
from	4
nose,	4
mouth,	4
and	4
ears,	4
reeling	4
as	4
if	4
about	4
to	4
fall	4
backwards	4
from	4
his	4
mule,	4
as	4
no	4
doubt	4
he	4
would	4
have	4
done	4
had	4
he	4
not	4
flung	4
his	4
arms	4
about	4
its	4
neck;	4
at	4
the	4
same	4
time,	4
however,	4
he	4
slipped	4
his	4
feet	4
out	4
of	4
the	4
stirrups	4
and	4
then	4
unclasped	4
his	4
arms,	4
and	4
the	4
mule,	4
taking	4
fright	4
at	4
the	4
terrible	4
blow,	4
made	4
off	4
across	4
the	4
plain,	4
and	4
with	4
a	4
few	4
plunges	4
flung	4
its	4
master	4
to	4
the	4
ground.	4
Don	4
Quixote	4
stood	4
looking	4
on	4
very	4
calmly,	4
and,	4
when	4
he	4
saw	4
him	4
fall,	4
leaped	4
from	4
his	4
horse	4
and	4
with	4
great	4
briskness	4
ran	4
to	4
him,	4
and,	4
presenting	4
the	4
point	4
of	4
his	4
sword	4
to	4
his	4
eyes,	4
bade	4
him	4
surrender,	4
or	4
he	4
would	4
cut	4
his	4
head	4
off.	4
The	4
Biscayan	4
was	4
so	4
bewildered	4
that	4
he	4
was	4
unable	4
to	4
answer	4
a	4
word,	4
and	4
it	4
would	4
have	4
gone	4
hard	4
with	4
him,	4
so	4
blind	4
was	4
Don	4
Quixote,	4
had	4
not	4
the	4
ladies	4
in	4
the	4
coach,	4
who	4
had	4
hitherto	4
been	4
watching	4
the	4
combat	4
in	4
great	4
terror,	4
hastened	4
to	4
where	4
he	4
stood	4
and	4
implored	4
him	4
with	4
earnest	4
entreaties	4
to	4
grant	4
them	4
the	4
great	4
grace	4
and	4
favour	4
of	4
sparing	4
their	4
squire’s	4
life;	4
to	4
which	4
Don	4
Quixote	4
replied	4
with	4
much	4
gravity	4
and	4
dignity,	4
“In	4
truth,	4
fair	4
ladies,	4
I	4
am	4
well	4
content	4
to	4
do	4
what	4
ye	4
ask	4
of	4
me;	4
but	4
it	4
must	4
be	4
on	4
one	4
condition	4
and	4
understanding,	4
which	4
is	4
that	4
this	4
knight	4
promise	4
me	4
to	4
go	4
to	4
the	4
village	4
of	4
El	4
Toboso,	4
and	4
on	4
my	4
behalf	4
present	4
himself	4
before	4
the	4
peerless	4
lady	4
Dulcinea,	4
that	4
she	4
deal	4
with	4
him	4
as	4
shall	4
be	4
most	4
pleasing	4
to	4
her.”	4
The	4
terrified	4
and	4
disconsolate	4
ladies,	4
without	4
discussing	4
Don	4
Quixote’s	4
demand	4
or	4
asking	4
who	4
Dulcinea	4
might	4
be,	4
promised	4
that	4
their	4
squire	4
should	4
do	4
all	4
that	4
had	4
been	4
commanded.	4
“Then,	4
on	4
the	4
faith	4
of	4
that	4
promise,”	4
said	4
Don	4
Quixote,	4
“I	4
shall	4
do	4
him	4
no	4
further	4
harm,	4
though	4
he	4
well	4
deserves	4
it	4
of	4
me.”	4

Now	4
by	4
this	4
time	4
Sancho	4
had	4
risen,	4
rather	4
the	4
worse	4
for	4
the	4
handling	4
of	4
the	4
friars’	4
muleteers,	4
and	4
stood	4
watching	4
the	4
battle	4
of	4
his	4
master,	4
Don	4
Quixote,	4
and	4
praying	4
to	4
God	4
in	4
his	4
heart	4
that	4
it	4
might	4
be	4
his	4
will	4
to	4
grant	4
him	4
the	4
victory,	4
and	4
that	4
he	4
might	4
thereby	4
win	4
some	4
island	4
to	4
make	4
him	4
governor	4
of,	4
as	4
he	4
had	4
promised.	4
Seeing,	4
therefore,	4
that	4
the	4
struggle	4
was	4
now	4
over,	4
and	4
that	4
his	4
master	4
was	4
returning	4
to	4
mount	4
Rocinante,	4
he	4
approached	4
to	4
hold	4
the	4
stirrup	4
for	4
him,	4
and,	4
before	4
he	4
could	4
mount,	4
he	4
went	4
on	4
his	4
knees	4
before	4
him,	4
and	4
taking	4
his	4
hand,	4
kissed	4
it	4
saying,	4
“May	4
it	4
please	4
your	4
worship,	4
Señor	4
Don	4
Quixote,	4
to	4
give	4
me	4
the	4
government	4
of	4
that	4
island	4
which	4
has	4
been	4
won	4
in	4
this	4
hard	4
fight,	4
for	4
be	4
it	4
ever	4
so	4
big	4
I	4
feel	4
myself	4
in	4
sufficient	4
force	4
to	4
be	4
able	4
to	4
govern	4
it	4
as	4
much	4
and	4
as	4
well	4
as	4
anyone	4
in	4
the	4
world	4
who	4
has	4
ever	4
governed	4
islands.”	4
To	4
which	4
Don	4
Quixote	4
replied,	4
“Thou	4
must	4
take	4
notice,	4
brother	4
Sancho,	4
that	4
this	4
adventure	4
and	4
those	4
like	4
it	4
are	4
not	4
adventures	4
of	4
islands,	4
but	4
of	4
cross-roads,	4
in	4
which	4
nothing	4
is	4
got	4
except	4
a	4
broken	4
head	4
or	4
an	4
ear	4
the	4
less:	4
have	4
patience,	4
for	4
adventures	4
will	4
present	4
themselves	4
from	4
which	4
I	4
may	4
make	4
you,	4
not	4
only	4
a	4
governor,	4
but	4
something	4
more.”	4
Sancho	4
gave	4
him	4
many	4
thanks,	4
and	4
again	4
kissing	4
his	4
hand	4
and	4
the	4
skirt	4
of	4
his	4
hauberk,	4
helped	4
him	4
to	4
mount	4
Rocinante,	4
and	4
mounting	4
his	4
ass	4
himself,	4
proceeded	4
to	4
follow	4
his	4
master,	4
who	4
at	4
a	4
brisk	4
pace,	4
without	4
taking	4
leave,	4
or	4
saying	4
anything	4
further	4
to	4
the	4
ladies	4
belonging	4
to	4
the	4
coach,	4
turned	4
into	4
a	4
wood	4
that	4
was	4
hard	4
by.	4
Sancho	4
followed	4
him	4
at	4
his	4
ass’s	4
best	4
trot,	4
but	4
Rocinante	4
stepped	4
out	4
so	4
that,	4
seeing	4
himself	4
left	4
behind,	4
he	4
was	4
forced	4
to	4
call	4
to	4
his	4
master	4
to	4
wait	4
for	4
him.	4
Don	4
Quixote	4
did	4
so,	4
reining	4
in	4
Rocinante	4
until	4
his	4
weary	4
squire	4
came	4
up,	4
who	4
on	4
reaching	4
him	4
said,	4
“It	4
seems	4
to	4
me,	4
señor,	4
it	4
would	4
be	4
prudent	4
in	4
us	4
to	4
go	4
and	4
take	4
refuge	4
in	4
some	4
church,	4
for,	4
seeing	4
how	4
mauled	4
he	4
with	4
whom	4
you	4
fought	4
has	4
been	4
left,	4
it	4
will	4
be	4
no	4
wonder	4
if	4
they	4
give	4
information	4
of	4
the	4
affair	4
to	4
the	4
Holy	4
Brotherhood	4
and	4
arrest	4
us,	4
and,	4
faith,	4
if	4
they	4
do,	4
before	4
we	4
come	4
out	4
of	4
gaol	4
we	4
shall	4
have	4
to	4
sweat	4
for	4
it.”	4
“Peace,”	4
said	4
Don	4
Quixote;	4
“where	4
hast	4
thou	4
ever	4
seen	4
or	4
heard	4
that	4
a	4
knight-errant	4
has	4
been	4
arraigned	4
before	4
a	4
court	4
of	4
justice,	4
however	4
many	4
homicides	4
he	4
may	4
have	4
committed?”	4
“I	4
know	4
nothing	4
about	4
omecils,”	4
answered	4
Sancho,	4
“nor	4
in	4
my	4
life	4
have	4
had	4
anything	4
to	4
do	4
with	4
one;	4
I	4
only	4
know	4
that	4
the	4
Holy	4
Brotherhood	4
looks	4
after	4
those	4
who	4
fight	4
in	4
the	4
fields,	4
and	4
in	4
that	4
other	4
matter	4
I	4
do	4
not	4
meddle.”	4
“Then	4
thou	4
needst	4
have	4
no	4
uneasiness,	4
my	4
friend,”	4
said	4
Don	4
Quixote,	4
“for	4
I	4
will	4
deliver	4
thee	4
out	4
of	4
the	4
hands	4
of	4
the	4
Chaldeans,	4
much	4
more	4
out	4
of	4
those	4
of	4
the	4
Brotherhood.	4
But	4
tell	4
me,	4
as	4
thou	4
livest,	4
hast	4
thou	4
seen	4
a	4
more	4
valiant	4
knight	4
than	4
I	4
in	4
all	4
the	4
known	4
world;	4
hast	4
thou	4
read	4
in	4
history	4
of	4
any	4
who	4
has	4
or	4
had	4
higher	4
mettle	4
in	4
attack,	4
more	4
spirit	4
in	4
maintaining	4
it,	4
more	4
dexterity	4
in	4
wounding	4
or	4
skill	4
in	4
overthrowing?”	4
“The	4
truth	4
is,”	4
answered	4
Sancho,	4
“that	4
I	4
have	4
never	4
read	4
any	4
history,	4
for	4
I	4
can	4
neither	4
read	4
nor	4
write,	4
but	4
what	4
I	4
will	4
venture	4
to	4
bet	4
is	4
that	4
a	4
more	4
daring	4
master	4
than	4
your	4
worship	4
I	4
have	4
never	4
served	4
in	4
all	4
the	4
days	4
of	4
my	4
life,	4
and	4
God	4
grant	4
that	4
this	4
daring	4
be	4
not	4
paid	4
for	4
where	4
I	4
have	4
said;	4
what	4
I	4
beg	4
of	4
your	4
worship	4
is	4
to	4
dress	4
your	4
wound,	4
for	4
a	4
great	4
deal	4
of	4
blood	4
flows	4
from	4
that	4
ear,	4
and	4
I	4
have	4
here	4
some	4
lint	4
and	4
a	4
little	4
white	4
ointment	4
in	4
the	4
alforjas.”	4
“All	4
that	4
might	4
be	4
well	4
dispensed	4
with,”	4
said	4
Don	4
Quixote,	4
“if	4
I	4
had	4
remembered	4
to	4
make	4
a	4
vial	4
of	4
the	4
balsam	4
of	4
Fierabras,	4
for	4
time	4
and	4
medicine	4
are	4
saved	4
by	4
one	4
single	4
drop.”	4
“What	4
vial	4
and	4
what	4
balsam	4
is	4
that?”	4
said	4
Sancho	4
Panza.	4
“It	4
is	4
a	4
balsam,”	4
answered	4
Don	4
Quixote,	4
“the	4
receipt	4
of	4
which	4
I	4
have	4
in	4
my	4
memory,	4
with	4
which	4
one	4
need	4
have	4
no	4
fear	4
of	4
death,	4
or	4
dread	4
dying	4
of	4
any	4
wound;	4
and	4
so	4
when	4
I	4
make	4
it	4
and	4
give	4
it	4
to	4
thee	4
thou	4
hast	4
nothing	4
to	4
do	4
when	4
in	4
some	4
battle	4
thou	4
seest	4
they	4
have	4
cut	4
me	4
in	4
half	4
through	4
the	4
middle	4
of	4
the	4
body—as	4
is	4
wont	4
to	4
happen	4
frequently—but	4
neatly	4
and	4
with	4
great	4
nicety,	4
ere	4
the	4
blood	4
congeal,	4
to	4
place	4
that	4
portion	4
of	4
the	4
body	4
which	4
shall	4
have	4
fallen	4
to	4
the	4
ground	4
upon	4
the	4
other	4
half	4
which	4
remains	4
in	4
the	4
saddle,	4
taking	4
care	4
to	4
fit	4
it	4
on	4
evenly	4
and	4
exactly.	4
Then	4
thou	4
shalt	4
give	4
me	4
to	4
drink	4
but	4
two	4
drops	4
of	4
the	4
balsam	4
I	4
have	4
mentioned,	4
and	4
thou	4
shalt	4
see	4
me	4
become	4
sounder	4
than	4
an	4
apple.”	4
“If	4
that	4
be	4
so,”	4
said	4
Panza,	4
“I	4
renounce	4
henceforth	4
the	4
government	4
of	4
the	4
promised	4
island,	4
and	4
desire	4
nothing	4
more	4
in	4
payment	4
of	4
my	4
many	4
and	4
faithful	4
services	4
than	4
that	4
your	4
worship	4
give	4
me	4
the	4
receipt	4
of	4
this	4
supreme	4
liquor,	4
for	4
I	4
am	4
persuaded	4
it	4
will	4
be	4
worth	4
more	4
than	4
two	4
reals	4
an	4
ounce	4
anywhere,	4
and	4
I	4
want	4
no	4
more	4
to	4
pass	4
the	4
rest	4
of	4
my	4
life	4
in	4
ease	4
and	4
honour;	4
but	4
it	4
remains	4
to	4
be	4
told	4
if	4
it	4
costs	4
much	4
to	4
make	4
it.”	4
“With	4
less	4
than	4
three	4
reals,	4
six	4
quarts	4
of	4
it	4
may	4
be	4
made,”	4
said	4
Don	4
Quixote.	4
“Sinner	4
that	4
I	4
am!”	4
said	4
Sancho,	4
“then	4
why	4
does	4
your	4
worship	4
put	4
off	4
making	4
it	4
and	4
teaching	4
it	4
to	4
me?”	4
“Peace,	4
friend,”	4
answered	4
Don	4
Quixote;	4
“greater	4
secrets	4
I	4
mean	4
to	4
teach	4
thee	4
and	4
greater	4
favours	4
to	4
bestow	4
upon	4
thee;	4
and	4
for	4
the	4
present	4
let	4
us	4
see	4
to	4
the	4
dressing,	4
for	4
my	4
ear	4
pains	4
me	4
more	4
than	4
I	4
could	4
wish.”	4
Sancho	4
took	4
out	4
some	4
lint	4
and	4
ointment	4
from	4
the	4
alforjas;	4
but	4
when	4
Don	4
Quixote	4
came	4
to	4
see	4
his	4
helmet	4
shattered,	4
he	4
was	4
like	4
to	4
lose	4
his	4
senses,	4
and	4
clapping	4
his	4
hand	4
upon	4
his	4
sword	4
and	4
raising	4
his	4
eyes	4
to	4
heaven,	4
he	4
said,	4
“I	4
swear	4
by	4
the	4
Creator	4
of	4
all	4
things	4
and	4
the	4
four	4
Gospels	4
in	4
their	4
fullest	4
extent,	4
to	4
do	4
as	4
the	4
great	4
Marquis	4
of	4
Mantua	4
did	4
when	4
he	4
swore	4
to	4
avenge	4
the	4
death	4
of	4
his	4
nephew	4
Baldwin	4
(and	4
that	4
was	4
not	4
to	4
eat	4
bread	4
from	4
a	4
table-cloth,	4
nor	4
embrace	4
his	4
wife,	4
and	4
other	4
points	4
which,	4
though	4
I	4
cannot	4
now	4
call	4
them	4
to	4
mind,	4
I	4
here	4
grant	4
as	4
expressed)	4
until	4
I	4
take	4
complete	4
vengeance	4
upon	4
him	4
who	4
has	4
committed	4
such	4
an	4
offence	4
against	4
me.”	4
Hearing	4
this,	4
Sancho	4
said	4
to	4
him,	4
“Your	4
worship	4
should	4
bear	4
in	4
mind,	4
Señor	4
Don	4
Quixote,	4
that	4
if	4
the	4
knight	4
has	4
done	4
what	4
was	4
commanded	4
him	4
in	4
going	4
to	4
present	4
himself	4
before	4
my	4
lady	4
Dulcinea	4
del	4
Toboso,	4
he	4
will	4
have	4
done	4
all	4
that	4
he	4
was	4
bound	4
to	4
do,	4
and	4
does	4
not	4
deserve	4
further	4
punishment	4
unless	4
he	4
commits	4
some	4
new	4
offence.”	4
“Thou	4
hast	4
said	4
well	4
and	4
hit	4
the	4
point,”	4
answered	4
Don	4
Quixote;	4
and	4
so	4
I	4
recall	4
the	4
oath	4
in	4
so	4
far	4
as	4
relates	4
to	4
taking	4
fresh	4
vengeance	4
on	4
him,	4
but	4
I	4
make	4
and	4
confirm	4
it	4
anew	4
to	4
lead	4
the	4
life	4
I	4
have	4
said	4
until	4
such	4
time	4
as	4
I	4
take	4
by	4
force	4
from	4
some	4
knight	4
another	4
helmet	4
such	4
as	4
this	4
and	4
as	4
good;	4
and	4
think	4
not,	4
Sancho,	4
that	4
I	4
am	4
raising	4
smoke	4
with	4
straw	4
in	4
doing	4
so,	4
for	4
I	4
have	4
one	4
to	4
imitate	4
in	4
the	4
matter,	4
since	4
the	4
very	4
same	4
thing	4
to	4
a	4
hair	4
happened	4
in	4
the	4
case	4
of	4
Mambrino’s	4
helmet,	4
which	4
cost	4
Sacripante	4
so	4
dear.”	4
“Señor,”	4
replied	4
Sancho,	4
“let	4
your	4
worship	4
send	4
all	4
such	4
oaths	4
to	4
the	4
devil,	4
for	4
they	4
are	4
very	4
pernicious	4
to	4
salvation	4
and	4
prejudicial	4
to	4
the	4
conscience;	4
just	4
tell	4
me	4
now,	4
if	4
for	4
several	4
days	4
to	4
come	4
we	4
fall	4
in	4
with	4
no	4
man	4
armed	4
with	4
a	4
helmet,	4
what	4
are	4
we	4
to	4
do?	4
Is	4
the	4
oath	4
to	4
be	4
observed	4
in	4
spite	4
of	4
all	4
the	4
inconvenience	4
and	4
discomfort	4
it	4
will	4
be	4
to	4
sleep	4
in	4
your	4
clothes,	4
and	4
not	4
to	4
sleep	4
in	4
a	4
house,	4
and	4
a	4
thousand	4
other	4
mortifications	4
contained	4
in	4
the	4
oath	4
of	4
that	4
old	4
fool	4
the	4
Marquis	4
of	4
Mantua,	4
which	4
your	4
worship	4
is	4
now	4
wanting	4
to	4
revive?	4
Let	4
your	4
worship	4
observe	4
that	4
there	4
are	4
no	4
men	4
in	4
armour	4
travelling	4
on	4
any	4
of	4
these	4
roads,	4
nothing	4
but	4
carriers	4
and	4
carters,	4
who	4
not	4
only	4
do	4
not	4
wear	4
helmets,	4
but	4
perhaps	4
never	4
heard	4
tell	4
of	4
them	4
all	4
their	4
lives.”	4
“Thou	4
art	4
wrong	4
there,”	4
said	4
Don	4
Quixote,	4
“for	4
we	4
shall	4
not	4
have	4
been	4
above	4
two	4
hours	4
among	4
these	4
cross-roads	4
before	4
we	4
see	4
more	4
men	4
in	4
armour	4
than	4
came	4
to	4
Albraca	4
to	4
win	4
the	4
fair	4
Angelica.”	4
“Enough,”	4
said	4
Sancho;	4
“so	4
be	4
it	4
then,	4
and	4
God	4
grant	4
us	4
success,	4
and	4
that	4
the	4
time	4
for	4
winning	4
that	4
island	4
which	4
is	4
costing	4
me	4
so	4
dear	4
may	4
soon	4
come,	4
and	4
then	4
let	4
me	4
die.”	4
“I	4
have	4
already	4
told	4
thee,	4
Sancho,”	4
said	4
Don	4
Quixote,	4
“not	4
to	4
give	4
thyself	4
any	4
uneasiness	4
on	4
that	4
score;	4
for	4
if	4
an	4
island	4
should	4
fail,	4
there	4
is	4
the	4
kingdom	4
of	4
Denmark,	4
or	4
of	4
Sobradisa,	4
which	4
will	4
fit	4
thee	4
as	4
a	4
ring	4
fits	4
the	4
finger,	4
and	4
all	4
the	4
more	4
that,	4
being	4
on	4
_terra	4
firma_,	4
thou	4
wilt	4
all	4
the	4
better	4
enjoy	4
thyself.	4
But	4
let	4
us	4
leave	4
that	4
to	4
its	4
own	4
time;	4
see	4
if	4
thou	4
hast	4
anything	4
for	4
us	4
to	4
eat	4
in	4
those	4
alforjas,	4
because	4
we	4
must	4
presently	4
go	4
in	4
quest	4
of	4
some	4
castle	4
where	4
we	4
may	4
lodge	4
to-night	4
and	4
make	4
the	4
balsam	4
I	4
told	4
thee	4
of,	4
for	4
I	4
swear	4
to	4
thee	4
by	4
God,	4
this	4
ear	4
is	4
giving	4
me	4
great	4
pain.”	4
“I	4
have	4
here	4
an	4
onion	4
and	4
a	4
little	4
cheese	4
and	4
a	4
few	4
scraps	4
of	4
bread,”	4
said	4
Sancho,	4
“but	4
they	4
are	4
not	4
victuals	4
fit	4
for	4
a	4
valiant	4
knight	4
like	4
your	4
worship.”	4
“How	4
little	4
thou	4
knowest	4
about	4
it,”	4
answered	4
Don	4
Quixote;	4
“I	4
would	4
have	4
thee	4
to	4
know,	4
Sancho,	4
that	4
it	4
is	4
the	4
glory	4
of	4
knights-errant	4
to	4
go	4
without	4
eating	4
for	4
a	4
month,	4
and	4
even	4
when	4
they	4
do	4
eat,	4
that	4
it	4
should	4
be	4
of	4
what	4
comes	4
first	4
to	4
hand;	4
and	4
this	4
would	4
have	4
been	4
clear	4
to	4
thee	4
hadst	4
thou	4
read	4
as	4
many	4
histories	4
as	4
I	4
have,	4
for,	4
though	4
they	4
are	4
very	4
many,	4
among	4
them	4
all	4
I	4
have	4
found	4
no	4
mention	4
made	4
of	4
knights-errant	4
eating,	4
unless	4
by	4
accident	4
or	4
at	4
some	4
sumptuous	4
banquets	4
prepared	4
for	4
them,	4
and	4
the	4
rest	4
of	4
the	4
time	4
they	4
passed	4
in	4
dalliance.	4
And	4
though	4
it	4
is	4
plain	4
they	4
could	4
not	4
do	4
without	4
eating	4
and	4
performing	4
all	4
the	4
other	4
natural	4
functions,	4
because,	4
in	4
fact,	4
they	4
were	4
men	4
like	4
ourselves,	4
it	4
is	4
plain	4
too	4
that,	4
wandering	4
as	4
they	4
did	4
the	4
most	4
part	4
of	4
their	4
lives	4
through	4
woods	4
and	4
wilds	4
and	4
without	4
a	4
cook,	4
their	4
most	4
usual	4
fare	4
would	4
be	4
rustic	4
viands	4
such	4
as	4
those	4
thou	4
now	4
offer	4
me;	4
so	4
that,	4
friend	4
Sancho,	4
let	4
not	4
that	4
distress	4
thee	4
which	4
pleases	4
me,	4
and	4
do	4
not	4
seek	4
to	4
make	4
a	4
new	4
world	4
or	4
pervert	4
knight-errantry.”	4
“Pardon	4
me,	4
your	4
worship,”	4
said	4
Sancho,	4
“for,	4
as	4
I	4
cannot	4
read	4
or	4
write,	4
as	4
I	4
said	4
just	4
now,	4
I	4
neither	4
know	4
nor	4
comprehend	4
the	4
rules	4
of	4
the	4
profession	4
of	4
chivalry:	4
henceforward	4
I	4
will	4
stock	4
the	4
alforjas	4
with	4
every	4
kind	4
of	4
dry	4
fruit	4
for	4
your	4
worship,	4
as	4
you	4
are	4
a	4
knight;	4
and	4
for	4
myself,	4
as	4
I	4
am	4
not	4
one,	4
I	4
will	4
furnish	4
them	4
with	4
poultry	4
and	4
other	4
things	4
more	4
substantial.”	4
“I	4
do	4
not	4
say,	4
Sancho,”	4
replied	4
Don	4
Quixote,	4
“that	4
it	4
is	4
imperative	4
on	4
knights-errant	4
not	4
to	4
eat	4
anything	4
else	4
but	4
the	4
fruits	4
thou	4
speakest	4
of;	4
only	4
that	4
their	4
more	4
usual	4
diet	4
must	4
be	4
those,	4
and	4
certain	4
herbs	4
they	4
found	4
in	4
the	4
fields	4
which	4
they	4
knew	4
and	4
I	4
know	4
too.”	4
“A	4
good	4
thing	4
it	4
is,”	4
answered	4
Sancho,	4
“to	4
know	4
those	4
herbs,	4
for	4
to	4
my	4
thinking	4
it	4
will	4
be	4
needful	4
some	4
day	4
to	4
put	4
that	4
knowledge	4
into	4
practice.”	4
And	4
here	4
taking	4
out	4
what	4
he	4
said	4
he	4
had	4
brought,	4
the	4
pair	4
made	4
their	4
repast	4
peaceably	4
and	4
sociably.	4
But	4
anxious	4
to	4
find	4
quarters	4
for	4
the	4
night,	4
they	4
with	4
all	4
despatch	4
made	4
an	4
end	4
of	4
their	4
poor	4
dry	4
fare,	4
mounted	4
at	4
once,	4
and	4
made	4
haste	4
to	4
reach	4
some	4
habitation	4
before	4
night	4
set	4
in;	4
but	4
daylight	4
and	4
the	4
hope	4
of	4
succeeding	4
in	4
their	4
object	4
failed	4
them	4
close	4
by	4
the	4
huts	4
of	4
some	4
goatherds,	4
so	4
they	4
determined	4
to	4
pass	4
the	4
night	4
there,	4
and	4
it	4
was	4
as	4
much	4
to	4
Sancho’s	4
discontent	4
not	4
to	4
have	4
reached	4
a	4
house,	4
as	4
it	4
was	4
to	4
his	4
master’s	4
satisfaction	4
to	4
sleep	4
under	4
the	4
open	4
heaven,	4
for	4
he	4
fancied	4
that	4
each	4
time	4
this	4
happened	4
to	4
him	4
he	4
performed	4
an	4
act	4
of	4
ownership	4
that	4
helped	4
to	4
prove	4
his	4
chivalry.	4

He	4
was	4
cordially	4
welcomed	4
by	4
the	4
goatherds,	4
and	4
Sancho,	4
having	4
as	4
best	4
he	4
could	4
put	4
up	4
Rocinante	4
and	4
the	4
ass,	4
drew	4
towards	4
the	4
fragrance	4
that	4
came	4
from	4
some	4
pieces	4
of	4
salted	4
goat	4
simmering	4
in	4
a	4
pot	4
on	4
the	4
fire;	4
and	4
though	4
he	4
would	4
have	4
liked	4
at	4
once	4
to	4
try	4
if	4
they	4
were	4
ready	4
to	4
be	4
transferred	4
from	4
the	4
pot	4
to	4
the	4
stomach,	4
he	4
refrained	4
from	4
doing	4
so	4
as	4
the	4
goatherds	4
removed	4
them	4
from	4
the	4
fire,	4
and	4
laying	4
sheepskins	4
on	4
the	4
ground,	4
quickly	4
spread	4
their	4
rude	4
table,	4
and	4
with	4
signs	4
of	4
hearty	4
good-will	4
invited	4
them	4
both	4
to	4
share	4
what	4
they	4
had.	4
Round	4
the	4
skins	4
six	4
of	4
the	4
men	4
belonging	4
to	4
the	4
fold	4
seated	4
themselves,	4
having	4
first	4
with	4
rough	4
politeness	4
pressed	4
Don	4
Quixote	4
to	4
take	4
a	4
seat	4
upon	4
a	4
trough	4
which	4
they	4
placed	4
for	4
him	4
upside	4
down.	4
Don	4
Quixote	4
seated	4
himself,	4
and	4
Sancho	4
remained	4
standing	4
to	4
serve	4
the	4
cup,	4
which	4
was	4
made	4
of	4
horn.	4
Seeing	4
him	4
standing,	4
his	4
master	4
said	4
to	4
him:	4
“That	4
thou	4
mayest	4
see,	4
Sancho,	4
the	4
good	4
that	4
knight-errantry	4
contains	4
in	4
itself,	4
and	4
how	4
those	4
who	4
fill	4
any	4
office	4
in	4
it	4
are	4
on	4
the	4
high	4
road	4
to	4
be	4
speedily	4
honoured	4
and	4
esteemed	4
by	4
the	4
world,	4
I	4
desire	4
that	4
thou	4
seat	4
thyself	4
here	4
at	4
my	4
side	4
and	4
in	4
the	4
company	4
of	4
these	4
worthy	4
people,	4
and	4
that	4
thou	4
be	4
one	4
with	4
me	4
who	4
am	4
thy	4
master	4
and	4
natural	4
lord,	4
and	4
that	4
thou	4
eat	4
from	4
my	4
plate	4
and	4
drink	4
from	4
whatever	4
I	4
drink	4
from;	4
for	4
the	4
same	4
may	4
be	4
said	4
of	4
knight-errantry	4
as	4
of	4
love,	4
that	4
it	4
levels	4
all.”	4
“Great	4
thanks,”	4
said	4
Sancho,	4
“but	4
I	4
may	4
tell	4
your	4
worship	4
that	4
provided	4
I	4
have	4
enough	4
to	4
eat,	4
I	4
can	4
eat	4
it	4
as	4
well,	4
or	4
better,	4
standing,	4
and	4
by	4
myself,	4
than	4
seated	4
alongside	4
of	4
an	4
emperor.	4
And	4
indeed,	4
if	4
the	4
truth	4
is	4
to	4
be	4
told,	4
what	4
I	4
eat	4
in	4
my	4
corner	4
without	4
form	4
or	4
fuss	4
has	4
much	4
more	4
relish	4
for	4
me,	4
even	4
though	4
it	4
be	4
bread	4
and	4
onions,	4
than	4
the	4
turkeys	4
of	4
those	4
other	4
tables	4
where	4
I	4
am	4
forced	4
to	4
chew	4
slowly,	4
drink	4
little,	4
wipe	4
my	4
mouth	4
every	4
minute,	4
and	4
cannot	4
sneeze	4
or	4
cough	4
if	4
I	4
want	4
or	4
do	4
other	4
things	4
that	4
are	4
the	4
privileges	4
of	4
liberty	4
and	4
solitude.	4
So,	4
señor,	4
as	4
for	4
these	4
honours	4
which	4
your	4
worship	4
would	4
put	4
upon	4
me	4
as	4
a	4
servant	4
and	4
follower	4
of	4
knight-errantry,	4
exchange	4
them	4
for	4
other	4
things	4
which	4
may	4
be	4
of	4
more	4
use	4
and	4
advantage	4
to	4
me;	4
for	4
these,	4
though	4
I	4
fully	4
acknowledge	4
them	4
as	4
received,	4
I	4
renounce	4
from	4
this	4
moment	4
to	4
the	4
end	4
of	4
the	4
world.”	4
“For	4
all	4
that,”	4
said	4
Don	4
Quixote,	4
“thou	4
must	4
seat	4
thyself,	4
because	4
him	4
who	4
humbleth	4
himself	4
God	4
exalteth;”	4
and	4
seizing	4
him	4
by	4
the	4
arm	4
he	4
forced	4
him	4
to	4
sit	4
down	4
beside	4
himself.	4
The	4
goatherds	4
did	4
not	4
understand	4
this	4
jargon	4
about	4
squires	4
and	4
knights-errant,	4
and	4
all	4
they	4
did	4
was	4
to	4
eat	4
in	4
silence	4
and	4
stare	4
at	4
their	4
guests,	4
who	4
with	4
great	4
elegance	4
and	4
appetite	4
were	4
stowing	4
away	4
pieces	4
as	4
big	4
as	4
one’s	4
fist.	4
The	4
course	4
of	4
meat	4
finished,	4
they	4
spread	4
upon	4
the	4
sheepskins	4
a	4
great	4
heap	4
of	4
parched	4
acorns,	4
and	4
with	4
them	4
they	4
put	4
down	4
a	4
half	4
cheese	4
harder	4
than	4
if	4
it	4
had	4
been	4
made	4
of	4
mortar.	4
All	4
this	4
while	4
the	4
horn	4
was	4
not	4
idle,	4
for	4
it	4
went	4
round	4
so	4
constantly,	4
now	4
full,	4
now	4
empty,	4
like	4
the	4
bucket	4
of	4
a	4
water-wheel,	4
that	4
it	4
soon	4
drained	4
one	4
of	4
the	4
two	4
wine-skins	4
that	4
were	4
in	4
sight.	4
When	4
Don	4
Quixote	4
had	4
quite	4
appeased	4
his	4
appetite	4
he	4
took	4
up	4
a	4
handful	4
of	4
the	4
acorns,	4
and	4
contemplating	4
them	4
attentively	4
delivered	4
himself	4
somewhat	4
in	4
this	4
fashion:	4
“Happy	4
the	4
age,	4
happy	4
the	4
time,	4
to	4
which	4
the	4
ancients	4
gave	4
the	4
name	4
of	4
golden,	4
not	4
because	4
in	4
that	4
fortunate	4
age	4
the	4
gold	4
so	4
coveted	4
in	4
this	4
our	4
iron	4
one	4
was	4
gained	4
without	4
toil,	4
but	4
because	4
they	4
that	4
lived	4
in	4
it	4
knew	4
not	4
the	4
two	4
words	4
“_mine_”	4
and	4
“_thine_”!	4
In	4
that	4
blessed	4
age	4
all	4
things	4
were	4
in	4
common;	4
to	4
win	4
the	4
daily	4
food	4
no	4
labour	4
was	4
required	4
of	4
any	4
save	4
to	4
stretch	4
forth	4
his	4
hand	4
and	4
gather	4
it	4
from	4
the	4
sturdy	4
oaks	4
that	4
stood	4
generously	4
inviting	4
him	4
with	4
their	4
sweet	4
ripe	4
fruit.	4
The	4
clear	4
streams	4
and	4
running	4
brooks	4
yielded	4
their	4
savoury	4
limpid	4
waters	4
in	4
noble	4
abundance.	4
The	4
busy	4
and	4
sagacious	4
bees	4
fixed	4
their	4
republic	4
in	4
the	4
clefts	4
of	4
the	4
rocks	4
and	4
hollows	4
of	4
the	4
trees,	4
offering	4
without	4
usance	4
the	4
plenteous	4
produce	4
of	4
their	4
fragrant	4
toil	4
to	4
every	4
hand.	4
The	4
mighty	4
cork	4
trees,	4
unenforced	4
save	4
of	4
their	4
own	4
courtesy,	4
shed	4
the	4
broad	4
light	4
bark	4
that	4
served	4
at	4
first	4
to	4
roof	4
the	4
houses	4
supported	4
by	4
rude	4
stakes,	4
a	4
protection	4
against	4
the	4
inclemency	4
of	4
heaven	4
alone.	4
Then	4
all	4
was	4
peace,	4
all	4
friendship,	4
all	4
concord;	4
as	4
yet	4
the	4
dull	4
share	4
of	4
the	4
crooked	4
plough	4
had	4
not	4
dared	4
to	4
rend	4
and	4
pierce	4
the	4
tender	4
bowels	4
of	4
our	4
first	4
mother	4
that	4
without	4
compulsion	4
yielded	4
from	4
every	4
portion	4
of	4
her	4
broad	4
fertile	4
bosom	4
all	4
that	4
could	4
satisfy,	4
sustain,	4
and	4
delight	4
the	4
children	4
that	4
then	4
possessed	4
her.	4
Then	4
was	4
it	4
that	4
the	4
innocent	4
and	4
fair	4
young	4
shepherdess	4
roamed	4
from	4
vale	4
to	4
vale	4
and	4
hill	4
to	4
hill,	4
with	4
flowing	4
locks,	4
and	4
no	4
more	4
garments	4
than	4
were	4
needful	4
modestly	4
to	4
cover	4
what	4
modesty	4
seeks	4
and	4
ever	4
sought	4
to	4
hide.	4
Nor	4
were	4
their	4
ornaments	4
like	4
those	4
in	4
use	4
to-day,	4
set	4
off	4
by	4
Tyrian	4
purple,	4
and	4
silk	4
tortured	4
in	4
endless	4
fashions,	4
but	4
the	4
wreathed	4
leaves	4
of	4
the	4
green	4
dock	4
and	4
ivy,	4
wherewith	4
they	4
went	4
as	4
bravely	4
and	4
becomingly	4
decked	4
as	4
our	4
Court	4
dames	4
with	4
all	4
the	4
rare	4
and	4
far-fetched	4
artifices	4
that	4
idle	4
curiosity	4
has	4
taught	4
them.	4
Then	4
the	4
love-thoughts	4
of	4
the	4
heart	4
clothed	4
themselves	4
simply	4
and	4
naturally	4
as	4
the	4
heart	4
conceived	4
them,	4
nor	4
sought	4
to	4
commend	4
themselves	4
by	4
forced	4
and	4
rambling	4
verbiage.	4
Fraud,	4
deceit,	4
or	4
malice	4
had	4
then	4
not	4
yet	4
mingled	4
with	4
truth	4
and	4
sincerity.	4
Justice	4
held	4
her	4
ground,	4
undisturbed	4
and	4
unassailed	4
by	4
the	4
efforts	4
of	4
favour	4
and	4
of	4
interest,	4
that	4
now	4
so	4
much	4
impair,	4
pervert,	4
and	4
beset	4
her.	4
Arbitrary	4
law	4
had	4
not	4
yet	4
established	4
itself	4
in	4
the	4
mind	4
of	4
the	4
judge,	4
for	4
then	4
there	4
was	4
no	4
cause	4
to	4
judge	4
and	4
no	4
one	4
to	4
be	4
judged.	4
Maidens	4
and	4
modesty,	4
as	4
I	4
have	4
said,	4
wandered	4
at	4
will	4
alone	4
and	4
unattended,	4
without	4
fear	4
of	4
insult	4
from	4
lawlessness	4
or	4
libertine	4
assault,	4
and	4
if	4
they	4
were	4
undone	4
it	4
was	4
of	4
their	4
own	4
will	4
and	4
pleasure.	4
But	4
now	4
in	4
this	4
hateful	4
age	4
of	4
ours	4
not	4
one	4
is	4
safe,	4
not	4
though	4
some	4
new	4
labyrinth	4
like	4
that	4
of	4
Crete	4
conceal	4
and	4
surround	4
her;	4
even	4
there	4
the	4
pestilence	4
of	4
gallantry	4
will	4
make	4
its	4
way	4
to	4
them	4
through	4
chinks	4
or	4
on	4
the	4
air	4
by	4
the	4
zeal	4
of	4
its	4
accursed	4
importunity,	4
and,	4
despite	4
of	4
all	4
seclusion,	4
lead	4
them	4
to	4
ruin.	4
In	4
defence	4
of	4
these,	4
as	4
time	4
advanced	4
and	4
wickedness	4
increased,	4
the	4
order	4
of	4
knights-errant	4
was	4
instituted,	4
to	4
defend	4
maidens,	4
to	4
protect	4
widows	4
and	4
to	4
succour	4
the	4
orphans	4
and	4
the	4
needy.	4
To	4
this	4
order	4
I	4
belong,	4
brother	4
goatherds,	4
to	4
whom	4
I	4
return	4
thanks	4
for	4
the	4
hospitality	4
and	4
kindly	4
welcome	4
ye	4
offer	4
me	4
and	4
my	4
squire;	4
for	4
though	4
by	4
natural	4
law	4
all	4
living	4
are	4
bound	4
to	4
show	4
favour	4
to	4
knights-errant,	4
yet,	4
seeing	4
that	4
without	4
knowing	4
this	4
obligation	4
ye	4
have	4
welcomed	4
and	4
feasted	4
me,	4
it	4
is	4
right	4
that	4
with	4
all	4
the	4
good-will	4
in	4
my	4
power	4
I	4
should	4
thank	4
you	4
for	4
yours.”	4

All	4
this	4
long	4
harangue	4
(which	4
might	4
very	4
well	4
have	4
been	4
spared)	4
our	4
knight	4
delivered	4
because	4
the	4
acorns	4
they	4
gave	4
him	4
reminded	4
him	4
of	4
the	4
golden	4
age;	4
and	4
the	4
whim	4
seized	4
him	4
to	4
address	4
all	4
this	4
unnecessary	4
argument	4
to	4
the	4
goatherds,	4
who	4
listened	4
to	4
him	4
gaping	4
in	4
amazement	4
without	4
saying	4
a	4
word	4
in	4
reply.	4
Sancho	4
likewise	4
held	4
his	4
peace	4
and	4
ate	4
acorns,	4
and	4
paid	4
repeated	4
visits	4
to	4
the	4
second	4
wine-skin,	4
which	4
they	4
had	4
hung	4
up	4
on	4
a	4
cork	4
tree	4
to	4
keep	4
the	4
wine	4
cool.	4
Don	4
Quixote	4
was	4
longer	4
in	4
talking	4
than	4
the	4
supper	4
in	4
finishing,	4
at	4
the	4
end	4
of	4
which	4
one	4
of	4
the	4
goatherds	4
said,	4
“That	4
your	4
worship,	4
señor	4
knight-errant,	4
may	4
say	4
with	4
more	4
truth	4
that	4
we	4
show	4
you	4
hospitality	4
with	4
ready	4
good-will,	4
we	4
will	4
give	4
you	4
amusement	4
and	4
pleasure	4
by	4
making	4
one	4
of	4
our	4
comrades	4
sing:	4
he	4
will	4
be	4
here	4
before	4
long,	4
and	4
he	4
is	4
a	4
very	4
intelligent	4
youth	4
and	4
deep	4
in	4
love,	4
and	4
what	4
is	4
more	4
he	4
can	4
read	4
and	4
write	4
and	4
play	4
on	4
the	4
rebeck	4
to	4
perfection.”	4
The	4
goatherd	4
had	4
hardly	4
done	4
speaking,	4
when	4
the	4
notes	4
of	4
the	4
rebeck	4
reached	4
their	4
ears;	4
and	4
shortly	4
after,	4
the	4
player	4
came	4
up,	4
a	4
very	4
good-looking	4
young	4
man	4
of	4
about	4
two-and-twenty.	4
His	4
comrades	4
asked	4
him	4
if	4
he	4
had	4
supped,	4
and	4
on	4
his	4
replying	4
that	4
he	4
had,	4
he	4
who	4
had	4
already	4
made	4
the	4
offer	4
said	4
to	4
him:	4
“In	4
that	4
case,	4
Antonio,	4
thou	4
mayest	4
as	4
well	4
do	4
us	4
the	4
pleasure	4
of	4
singing	4
a	4
little,	4
that	4
the	4
gentleman,	4
our	4
guest,	4
may	4
see	4
that	4
even	4
in	4
the	4
mountains	4
and	4
woods	4
there	4
are	4
musicians:	4
we	4
have	4
told	4
him	4
of	4
thy	4
accomplishments,	4
and	4
we	4
want	4
thee	4
to	4
show	4
them	4
and	4
prove	4
that	4
we	4
say	4
true;	4
so,	4
as	4
thou	4
livest,	4
pray	4
sit	4
down	4
and	4
sing	4
that	4
ballad	4
about	4
thy	4
love	4
that	4
thy	4
uncle	4
the	4
prebendary	4
made	4
thee,	4
and	4
that	4
was	4
so	4
much	4
liked	4
in	4
the	4
town.”	4
“With	4
all	4
my	4
heart,”	4
said	4
the	4
young	4
man,	4
and	4
without	4
waiting	4
for	4
more	4
pressing	4
he	4
seated	4
himself	4
on	4
the	4
trunk	4
of	4
a	4
felled	4
oak,	4
and	4
tuning	4
his	4
rebeck,	4
presently	4
began	4
to	4
sing	4
to	4
these	4
words.	4
ANTONIO’S	4
BALLAD	4
Thou	4
dost	4
love	4
me	4
well,	4
Olalla;	4
Well	4
I	4
know	4
it,	4
even	4
though	4
Love’s	4
mute	4
tongues,	4
thine	4
eyes,	4
have	4
never	4
By	4
their	4
glances	4
told	4
me	4
so.	4
For	4
I	4
know	4
my	4
love	4
thou	4
knowest,	4
Therefore	4
thine	4
to	4
claim	4
I	4
dare:	4
Once	4
it	4
ceases	4
to	4
be	4
secret,	4
Love	4
need	4
never	4
feel	4
despair.	4
True	4
it	4
is,	4
Olalla,	4
sometimes	4
Thou	4
hast	4
all	4
too	4
plainly	4
shown	4
That	4
thy	4
heart	4
is	4
brass	4
in	4
hardness,	4
And	4
thy	4
snowy	4
bosom	4
stone.	4
Yet	4
for	4
all	4
that,	4
in	4
thy	4
coyness,	4
And	4
thy	4
fickle	4
fits	4
between,	4
Hope	4
is	4
there—at	4
least	4
the	4
border	4
Of	4
her	4
garment	4
may	4
be	4
seen.	4
Lures	4
to	4
faith	4
are	4
they,	4
those	4
glimpses,	4
And	4
to	4
faith	4
in	4
thee	4
I	4
hold;	4
Kindness	4
cannot	4
make	4
it	4
stronger,	4
Coldness	4
cannot	4
make	4
it	4
cold.	4
If	4
it	4
be	4
that	4
love	4
is	4
gentle,	4
In	4
thy	4
gentleness	4
I	4
see	4
Something	4
holding	4
out	4
assurance	4
To	4
the	4
hope	4
of	4
winning	4
thee.	4
If	4
it	4
be	4
that	4
in	4
devotion	4
Lies	4
a	4
power	4
hearts	4
to	4
move,	4
That	4
which	4
every	4
day	4
I	4
show	4
thee,	4
Helpful	4
to	4
my	4
suit	4
should	4
prove.	4
Many	4
a	4

thou	4

If	4
to	4

thou	4
dost	4
care—	4
How	4
I	4
go	4
about	4
on	4
Monday	4
Dressed	4
in	4
all	4
my	4
Sunday	4
wear.	4
Love’s	4
eyes	4
love	4
to	4
look	4
on	4
brightness;	4
Love	4
loves	4
what	4
is	4
gaily	4
drest;	4
Sunday,	4
Monday,	4
all	4
I	4
care	4
is	4
Thou	4
shouldst	4
see	4
me	4
in	4
my	4
best.	4
No	4
account	4
I	4
make	4
of	4
dances,	4
Or	4
of	4
strains	4
that	4
pleased	4
thee	4
so,	4
Keeping	4
thee	4
awake	4
from	4
midnight	4
Till	4
the	4
cocks	4
began	4
to	4
crow;	4
Or	4
of	4
how	4
I	4
roundly	4
swore	4
it	4
That	4
there’s	4
none	4
so	4
fair	4
as	4
thou;	4
True	4
it	4
is,	4
but	4
as	4
I	4
said	4
it,	4
By	4
the	4
girls	4
I’m	4
hated	4
now.	4
For	4
Teresa	4
of	4
the	4
hillside	4
At	4
my	4
praise	4
of	4
thee	4
was	4
sore;	4
Said,	4
“You	4
think	4
you	4
love	4
an	4
angel;	4
It’s	4
a	4
monkey	4
you	4
adore;	4
“Caught	4
by	4
all	4
her	4
glittering	4
trinkets,	4
And	4
her	4
borrowed	4
braids	4
of	4
hair,	4
And	4
a	4
host	4
of	4
made-up	4
beauties	4
That	4
would	4
Love	4
himself	4
ensnare.”	4
’Twas	4
a	4
lie,	4
and	4
so	4
I	4
told	4
her,	4
And	4
her	4
cousin	4
at	4
the	4
word	4
Gave	4
me	4
his	4
defiance	4
for	4
it;	4
And	4
what	4
followed	4
thou	4
hast	4
heard.	4
Mine	4
is	4
no	4
high-flown	4
affection,	4
Mine	4
no	4
passion	4
_par	4
amours_—	4
As	4
they	4
call	4
it—what	4
I	4
offer	4
Is	4
an	4
honest	4
love,	4
and	4
pure.	4
Cunning	4
cords	4
the	4
holy	4
Church	4
has,	4
Cords	4
of	4
softest	4
silk	4
they	4
be;	4
Put	4
thy	4
neck	4
beneath	4
the	4
yoke,	4
dear;	4
Mine	4
will	4
follow,	4
thou	4
wilt	4
see.	4
Else—and	4
once	4
for	4
all	4
I	4
swear	4
it	4
By	4
the	4
saint	4
of	4
most	4
renown—	4
If	4
I	4
ever	4
quit	4
the	4
mountains,	4
’Twill	4
be	4
in	4
a	4
friar’s	4
gown.	4
Here	4
the	4
goatherd	4
brought	4
his	4
song	4
to	4
an	4
end,	4
and	4
though	4
Don	4
Quixote	4
entreated	4
him	4
to	4
sing	4
more,	4
Sancho	4
had	4
no	4
mind	4
that	4
way,	4
being	4
more	4
inclined	4
for	4
sleep	4
than	4
for	4
listening	4
to	4
songs;	4
so	4
said	4
he	4
to	4
his	4
master,	4
“Your	4
worship	4
will	4
do	4
well	4
to	4
settle	4
at	4
once	4
where	4
you	4
mean	4
to	4
pass	4
the	4
night,	4
for	4
the	4
labour	4
these	4
good	4
men	4
are	4
at	4
all	4
day	4
does	4
not	4
allow	4
them	4
to	4
spend	4
the	4
night	4
in	4
singing.”	4
“I	4
understand	4
thee,	4
Sancho,”	4
replied	4
Don	4
Quixote;	4
“I	4
perceive	4
clearly	4
that	4
those	4
visits	4
to	4
the	4
wine-skin	4
demand	4
compensation	4
in	4
sleep	4
rather	4
than	4
in	4
music.”	4
“It’s	4
sweet	4
to	4
us	4
all,	4
blessed	4
be	4
God,”	4
said	4
Sancho.	4
“I	4
do	4
not	4
deny	4
it,”	4
replied	4
Don	4
Quixote;	4
“but	4
settle	4
thyself	4
where	4
thou	4
wilt;	4
those	4
of	4
my	4
calling	4
are	4
more	4
becomingly	4
employed	4
in	4
watching	4
than	4
in	4
sleeping;	4
still	4
it	4
would	4
be	4
as	4
well	4
if	4
thou	4
wert	4
to	4
dress	4
this	4
ear	4
for	4
me	4
again,	4
for	4
it	4
is	4
giving	4
me	4
more	4
pain	4
than	4
it	4
need.”	4
Sancho	4
did	4
as	4
he	4
bade	4
him,	4
but	4
one	4
of	4
the	4
goatherds,	4
seeing	4
the	4
wound,	4
told	4
him	4
not	4
to	4
be	4
uneasy,	4
as	4
he	4
would	4
apply	4
a	4
remedy	4
with	4
which	4
it	4
would	4
be	4
soon	4
healed;	4
and	4
gathering	4
some	4
leaves	4
of	4
rosemary,	4
of	4
which	4
there	4
was	4
a	4
great	4
quantity	4
there,	4
he	4
chewed	4
them	4
and	4
mixed	4
them	4
with	4
a	4
little	4
salt,	4
and	4
applying	4
them	4
to	4
the	4
ear	4
he	4
secured	4
them	4
firmly	4
with	4
a	4
bandage,	4
assuring	4
him	4
that	4
no	4
other	4
treatment	4
would	4
be	4
required,	4
and	4
so	4
it	4
proved.	4

Just	4
then	4
another	4
young	4
man,	4
one	4
of	4
those	4
who	4
fetched	4
their	4
provisions	4
from	4
the	4
village,	4
came	4
up	4
and	4
said,	4
“Do	4
you	4
know	4
what	4
is	4
going	4
on	4
in	4
the	4
village,	4
comrades?”	4
“How	4
could	4
we	4
know	4
it?”	4
replied	4
one	4
of	4
them.	4
“Well,	4
then,	4
you	4
must	4
know,”	4
continued	4
the	4
young	4
man,	4
“this	4
morning	4
that	4
famous	4
student-shepherd	4
called	4
Chrysostom	4
died,	4
and	4
it	4
is	4
rumoured	4
that	4
he	4
died	4
of	4
love	4
for	4
that	4
devil	4
of	4
a	4
village	4
girl	4
the	4
daughter	4
of	4
Guillermo	4
the	4
Rich,	4
she	4
that	4
wanders	4
about	4
the	4
wolds	4
here	4
in	4
the	4
dress	4
of	4
a	4
shepherdess.”	4
“You	4
mean	4
Marcela?”	4
said	4
one.	4
“Her	4
I	4
mean,”	4
answered	4
the	4
goatherd;	4
“and	4
the	4
best	4
of	4
it	4
is,	4
he	4
has	4
directed	4
in	4
his	4
will	4
that	4
he	4
is	4
to	4
be	4
buried	4
in	4
the	4
fields	4
like	4
a	4
Moor,	4
and	4
at	4
the	4
foot	4
of	4
the	4
rock	4
where	4
the	4
Cork-tree	4
spring	4
is,	4
because,	4
as	4
the	4
story	4
goes	4
(and	4
they	4
say	4
he	4
himself	4
said	4
so),	4
that	4
was	4
the	4
place	4
where	4
he	4
first	4
saw	4
her.	4
And	4
he	4
has	4
also	4
left	4
other	4
directions	4
which	4
the	4
clergy	4
of	4
the	4
village	4
say	4
should	4
not	4
and	4
must	4
not	4
be	4
obeyed	4
because	4
they	4
savour	4
of	4
paganism.	4
To	4
all	4
which	4
his	4
great	4
friend	4
Ambrosio	4
the	4
student,	4
he	4
who,	4
like	4
him,	4
also	4
went	4
dressed	4
as	4
a	4
shepherd,	4
replies	4
that	4
everything	4
must	4
be	4
done	4
without	4
any	4
omission	4
according	4
to	4
the	4
directions	4
left	4
by	4
Chrysostom,	4
and	4
about	4
this	4
the	4
village	4
is	4
all	4
in	4
commotion;	4
however,	4
report	4
says	4
that,	4
after	4
all,	4
what	4
Ambrosio	4
and	4
all	4
the	4
shepherds	4
his	4
friends	4
desire	4
will	4
be	4
done,	4
and	4
to-morrow	4
they	4
are	4
coming	4
to	4
bury	4
him	4
with	4
great	4
ceremony	4
where	4
I	4
said.	4
I	4
am	4
sure	4
it	4
will	4
be	4
something	4
worth	4
seeing;	4
at	4
least	4
I	4
will	4
not	4
fail	4
to	4
go	4
and	4
see	4
it	4
even	4
if	4
I	4
knew	4
I	4
should	4
not	4
return	4
to	4
the	4
village	4
to-morrow.”	4
“We	4
will	4
do	4
the	4
same,”	4
answered	4
the	4
goatherds,	4
“and	4
cast	4
lots	4
to	4
see	4
who	4
must	4
stay	4
to	4
mind	4
the	4
goats	4
of	4
all.”	4
“Thou	4
sayest	4
well,	4
Pedro,”	4
said	4
one,	4
“though	4
there	4
will	4
be	4
no	4
need	4
of	4
taking	4
that	4
trouble,	4
for	4
I	4
will	4
stay	4
behind	4
for	4
all;	4
and	4
don’t	4
suppose	4
it	4
is	4
virtue	4
or	4
want	4
of	4
curiosity	4
in	4
me;	4
it	4
is	4
that	4
the	4
splinter	4
that	4
ran	4
into	4
my	4
foot	4
the	4
other	4
day	4
will	4
not	4
let	4
me	4
walk.”	4
“For	4
all	4
that,	4
we	4
thank	4
thee,”	4
answered	4
Pedro.	4
Don	4
Quixote	4
asked	4
Pedro	4
to	4
tell	4
him	4
who	4
the	4
dead	4
man	4
was	4
and	4
who	4
the	4
shepherdess,	4
to	4
which	4
Pedro	4
replied	4
that	4
all	4
he	4
knew	4
was	4
that	4
the	4
dead	4
man	4
was	4
a	4
wealthy	4
gentleman	4
belonging	4
to	4
a	4
village	4
in	4
those	4
mountains,	4
who	4
had	4
been	4
a	4
student	4
at	4
Salamanca	4
for	4
many	4
years,	4
at	4
the	4
end	4
of	4
which	4
he	4
returned	4
to	4
his	4
village	4
with	4
the	4
reputation	4
of	4
being	4
very	4
learned	4
and	4
deeply	4
read.	4
“Above	4
all,	4
they	4
said,	4
he	4
was	4
learned	4
in	4
the	4
science	4
of	4
the	4
stars	4
and	4
of	4
what	4
went	4
on	4
yonder	4
in	4
the	4
heavens	4
and	4
the	4
sun	4
and	4
the	4
moon,	4
for	4
he	4
told	4
us	4
of	4
the	4
cris	4
of	4
the	4
sun	4
and	4
moon	4
to	4
exact	4
time.”	4
“Eclipse	4
it	4
is	4
called,	4
friend,	4
not	4
cris,	4
the	4
darkening	4
of	4
those	4
two	4
luminaries,”	4
said	4
Don	4
Quixote;	4
but	4
Pedro,	4
not	4
troubling	4
himself	4
with	4
trifles,	4
went	4
on	4
with	4
his	4
story,	4
saying,	4
“Also	4
he	4
foretold	4
when	4
the	4
year	4
was	4
going	4
to	4
be	4
one	4
of	4
abundance	4
or	4
estility.”	4
“Sterility,	4
you	4
mean,”	4
said	4
Don	4
Quixote.	4
“Sterility	4
or	4
estility,”	4
answered	4
Pedro,	4
“it	4
is	4
all	4
the	4
same	4
in	4
the	4
end.	4
And	4
I	4
can	4
tell	4
you	4
that	4
by	4
this	4
his	4
father	4
and	4
friends	4
who	4
believed	4
him	4
grew	4
very	4
rich	4
because	4
they	4
did	4
as	4
he	4
advised	4
them,	4
bidding	4
them	4
‘sow	4
barley	4
this	4
year,	4
not	4
wheat;	4
this	4
year	4
you	4
may	4
sow	4
pulse	4
and	4
not	4
barley;	4
the	4
next	4
there	4
will	4
be	4
a	4
full	4
oil	4
crop,	4
and	4
the	4
three	4
following	4
not	4
a	4
drop	4
will	4
be	4
got.’”	4
“That	4
science	4
is	4
called	4
astrology,”	4
said	4
Don	4
Quixote.	4
“I	4
do	4
not	4
know	4
what	4
it	4
is	4
called,”	4
replied	4
Pedro,	4
“but	4
I	4
know	4
that	4
he	4
knew	4
all	4
this	4
and	4
more	4
besides.	4
But,	4
to	4
make	4
an	4
end,	4
not	4
many	4
months	4
had	4
passed	4
after	4
he	4
returned	4
from	4
Salamanca,	4
when	4
one	4
day	4
he	4
appeared	4
dressed	4
as	4
a	4
shepherd	4
with	4
his	4
crook	4
and	4
sheepskin,	4
having	4
put	4
off	4
the	4
long	4
gown	4
he	4
wore	4
as	4
a	4
scholar;	4
and	4
at	4
the	4
same	4
time	4
his	4
great	4
friend,	4
Ambrosio	4
by	4
name,	4
who	4
had	4
been	4
his	4
companion	4
in	4
his	4
studies,	4
took	4
to	4
the	4
shepherd’s	4
dress	4
with	4
him.	4
I	4
forgot	4
to	4
say	4
that	4
Chrysostom,	4
who	4
is	4
dead,	4
was	4
a	4
great	4
man	4
for	4
writing	4
verses,	4
so	4
much	4
so	4
that	4
he	4
made	4
carols	4
for	4
Christmas	4
Eve,	4
and	4
plays	4
for	4
Corpus	4
Christi,	4
which	4
the	4
young	4
men	4
of	4
our	4
village	4
acted,	4
and	4
all	4
said	4
they	4
were	4
excellent.	4
When	4
the	4
villagers	4
saw	4
the	4
two	4
scholars	4
so	4
unexpectedly	4
appearing	4
in	4
shepherd’s	4
dress,	4
they	4
were	4
lost	4
in	4
wonder,	4
and	4
could	4
not	4
guess	4
what	4
had	4
led	4
them	4
to	4
make	4
so	4
extraordinary	4
a	4
change.	4
About	4
this	4
time	4
the	4
father	4
of	4
our	4
Chrysostom	4
died,	4
and	4
he	4
was	4
left	4
heir	4
to	4
a	4
large	4
amount	4
of	4
property	4
in	4
chattels	4
as	4
well	4
as	4
in	4
land,	4
no	4
small	4
number	4
of	4
cattle	4
and	4
sheep,	4
and	4
a	4
large	4
sum	4
of	4
money,	4
of	4
all	4
of	4
which	4
the	4
young	4
man	4
was	4
left	4
dissolute	4
owner,	4
and	4
indeed	4
he	4
was	4
deserving	4
of	4
it	4
all,	4
for	4
he	4
was	4
a	4
very	4
good	4
comrade,	4
and	4
kind-hearted,	4
and	4
a	4
friend	4
of	4
worthy	4
folk,	4
and	4
had	4
a	4
countenance	4
like	4
a	4
benediction.	4
Presently	4
it	4
came	4
to	4
be	4
known	4
that	4
he	4
had	4
changed	4
his	4
dress	4
with	4
no	4
other	4
object	4
than	4
to	4
wander	4
about	4
these	4
wastes	4
after	4
that	4
shepherdess	4
Marcela	4
our	4
lad	4
mentioned	4
a	4
while	4
ago,	4
with	4
whom	4
the	4
deceased	4
Chrysostom	4
had	4
fallen	4
in	4
love.	4
And	4
I	4
must	4
tell	4
you	4
now,	4
for	4
it	4
is	4
well	4
you	4
should	4
know	4
it,	4
who	4
this	4
girl	4
is;	4
perhaps,	4
and	4
even	4
without	4
any	4
perhaps,	4
you	4
will	4
not	4
have	4
heard	4
anything	4
like	4
it	4
all	4
the	4
days	4
of	4
your	4
life,	4
though	4
you	4
should	4
live	4
more	4
years	4
than	4
sarna.”	4
“Say	4
Sarra,”	4
said	4
Don	4
Quixote,	4
unable	4
to	4
endure	4
the	4
goatherd’s	4
confusion	4
of	4
words.	4
“The	4
sarna	4
lives	4
long	4
enough,”	4
answered	4
Pedro;	4
“and	4
if,	4
señor,	4
you	4
must	4
go	4
finding	4
fault	4
with	4
words	4
at	4
every	4
step,	4
we	4
shall	4
not	4
make	4
an	4
end	4
of	4
it	4
this	4
twelvemonth.”	4
“Pardon	4
me,	4
friend,”	4
said	4
Don	4
Quixote;	4
“but,	4
as	4
there	4
is	4
such	4
a	4
difference	4
between	4
sarna	4
and	4
Sarra,	4
I	4
told	4
you	4
of	4
it;	4
however,	4
you	4
have	4
answered	4
very	4
rightly,	4
for	4
sarna	4
lives	4
longer	4
than	4
Sarra:	4
so	4
continue	4
your	4
story,	4
and	4
I	4
will	4
not	4
object	4
any	4
more	4
to	4
anything.”	4
“I	4
say	4
then,	4
my	4
dear	4
sir,”	4
said	4
the	4
goatherd,	4
“that	4
in	4
our	4
village	4
there	4
was	4
a	4
farmer	4
even	4
richer	4
than	4
the	4
father	4
of	4
Chrysostom,	4
who	4
was	4
named	4
Guillermo,	4
and	4
upon	4
whom	4
God	4
bestowed,	4
over	4
and	4
above	4
great	4
wealth,	4
a	4
daughter	4
at	4
whose	4
birth	4
her	4
mother	4
died,	4
the	4
most	4
respected	4
woman	4
there	4
was	4
in	4
this	4
neighbourhood;	4
I	4
fancy	4
I	4
can	4
see	4
her	4
now	4
with	4
that	4
countenance	4
which	4
had	4
the	4
sun	4
on	4
one	4
side	4
and	4
the	4
moon	4
on	4
the	4
other;	4
and	4
moreover	4
active,	4
and	4
kind	4
to	4
the	4
poor,	4
for	4
which	4
I	4
trust	4
that	4
at	4
the	4
present	4
moment	4
her	4
soul	4
is	4
in	4
bliss	4
with	4
God	4
in	4
the	4
other	4
world.	4
Her	4
husband	4
Guillermo	4
died	4
of	4
grief	4
at	4
the	4
death	4
of	4
so	4
good	4
a	4
wife,	4
leaving	4
his	4
daughter	4
Marcela,	4
a	4
child	4
and	4
rich,	4
to	4
the	4
care	4
of	4
an	4
uncle	4
of	4
hers,	4
a	4
priest	4
and	4
prebendary	4
in	4
our	4
village.	4
The	4
girl	4
grew	4
up	4
with	4
such	4
beauty	4
that	4
it	4
reminded	4
us	4
of	4
her	4
mother’s,	4
which	4
was	4
very	4
great,	4
and	4
yet	4
it	4
was	4
thought	4
that	4
the	4
daughter’s	4
would	4
exceed	4
it;	4
and	4
so	4
when	4
she	4
reached	4
the	4
age	4
of	4
fourteen	4
to	4
fifteen	4
years	4
nobody	4
beheld	4
her	4
but	4
blessed	4
God	4
that	4
had	4
made	4
her	4
so	4
beautiful,	4
and	4
the	4
greater	4
number	4
were	4
in	4
love	4
with	4
her	4
past	4
redemption.	4
Her	4
uncle	4
kept	4
her	4
in	4
great	4
seclusion	4
and	4
retirement,	4
but	4
for	4
all	4
that	4
the	4
fame	4
of	4
her	4
great	4
beauty	4
spread	4
so	4
that,	4
as	4
well	4
for	4
it	4
as	4
for	4
her	4
great	4
wealth,	4
her	4
uncle	4
was	4
asked,	4
solicited,	4
and	4
importuned,	4
to	4
give	4
her	4
in	4
marriage	4
not	4
only	4
by	4
those	4
of	4
our	4
town	4
but	4
of	4
those	4
many	4
leagues	4
round,	4
and	4
by	4
the	4
persons	4
of	4
highest	4
quality	4
in	4
them.	4
But	4
he,	4
being	4
a	4
good	4
Christian	4
man,	4
though	4
he	4
desired	4
to	4
give	4
her	4
in	4
marriage	4
at	4
once,	4
seeing	4
her	4
to	4
be	4
old	4
enough,	4
was	4
unwilling	4
to	4
do	4
so	4
without	4
her	4
consent,	4
not	4
that	4
he	4
had	4
any	4
eye	4
to	4
the	4
gain	4
and	4
profit	4
which	4
the	4
custody	4
of	4
the	4
girl’s	4
property	4
brought	4
him	4
while	4
he	4
put	4
off	4
her	4
marriage;	4
and,	4
faith,	4
this	4
was	4
said	4
in	4
praise	4
of	4
the	4
good	4
priest	4
in	4
more	4
than	4
one	4
set	4
in	4
the	4
town.	4
For	4
I	4
would	4
have	4
you	4
know,	4
Sir	4
Errant,	4
that	4
in	4
these	4
little	4
villages	4
everything	4
is	4
talked	4
about	4
and	4
everything	4
is	4
carped	4
at,	4
and	4
rest	4
assured,	4
as	4
I	4
am,	4
that	4
the	4
priest	4
must	4
be	4
over	4
and	4
above	4
good	4
who	4
forces	4
his	4
parishioners	4
to	4
speak	4
well	4
of	4
him,	4
especially	4
in	4
villages.”	4
“That	4
is	4
the	4
truth,”	4
said	4
Don	4
Quixote;	4
“but	4
go	4
on,	4
for	4
the	4
story	4
is	4
very	4
good,	4
and	4
you,	4
good	4
Pedro,	4
tell	4
it	4
with	4
very	4
good	4
grace.”	4
“May	4
that	4
of	4
the	4
Lord	4
not	4
be	4
wanting	4
to	4
me,”	4
said	4
Pedro;	4
“that	4
is	4
the	4
one	4
to	4
have.	4
To	4
proceed;	4
you	4
must	4
know	4
that	4
though	4
the	4
uncle	4
put	4
before	4
his	4
niece	4
and	4
described	4
to	4
her	4
the	4
qualities	4
of	4
each	4
one	4
in	4
particular	4
of	4
the	4
many	4
who	4
had	4
asked	4
her	4
in	4
marriage,	4
begging	4
her	4
to	4
marry	4
and	4
make	4
a	4
choice	4
according	4
to	4
her	4
own	4
taste,	4
she	4
never	4
gave	4
any	4
other	4
answer	4
than	4
that	4
she	4
had	4
no	4
desire	4
to	4
marry	4
just	4
yet,	4
and	4
that	4
being	4
so	4
young	4
she	4
did	4
not	4
think	4
herself	4
fit	4
to	4
bear	4
the	4
burden	4
of	4
matrimony.	4
At	4
these,	4
to	4
all	4
appearance,	4
reasonable	4
excuses	4
that	4
she	4
made,	4
her	4
uncle	4
ceased	4
to	4
urge	4
her,	4
and	4
waited	4
till	4
she	4
was	4
somewhat	4
more	4
advanced	4
in	4
age	4
and	4
could	4
mate	4
herself	4
to	4
her	4
own	4
liking.	4
For,	4
said	4
he—and	4
he	4
said	4
quite	4
right—parents	4
are	4
not	4
to	4
settle	4
children	4
in	4
life	4
against	4
their	4
will.	4
But	4
when	4
one	4
least	4
looked	4
for	4
it,	4
lo	4
and	4
behold!	4
one	4
day	4
the	4
demure	4
Marcela	4
makes	4
her	4
appearance	4
turned	4
shepherdess;	4
and,	4
in	4
spite	4
of	4
her	4
uncle	4
and	4
all	4
those	4
of	4
the	4
town	4
that	4
strove	4
to	4
dissuade	4
her,	4
took	4
to	4
going	4
a-field	4
with	4
the	4
other	4
shepherd-lasses	4
of	4
the	4
village,	4
and	4
tending	4
her	4
own	4
flock.	4
And	4
so,	4
since	4
she	4
appeared	4
in	4
public,	4
and	4
her	4
beauty	4
came	4
to	4
be	4
seen	4
openly,	4
I	4
could	4
not	4
well	4
tell	4
you	4
how	4
many	4
rich	4
youths,	4
gentlemen	4
and	4
peasants,	4
have	4
adopted	4
the	4
costume	4
of	4
Chrysostom,	4
and	4
go	4
about	4
these	4
fields	4
making	4
love	4
to	4
her.	4
One	4
of	4
these,	4
as	4
has	4
been	4
already	4
said,	4
was	4
our	4
deceased	4
friend,	4
of	4
whom	4
they	4
say	4
that	4
he	4
did	4
not	4
love	4
but	4
adore	4
her.	4
But	4
you	4
must	4
not	4
suppose,	4
because	4
Marcela	4
chose	4
a	4
life	4
of	4
such	4
liberty	4
and	4
independence,	4
and	4
of	4
so	4
little	4
or	4
rather	4
no	4
retirement,	4
that	4
she	4
has	4
given	4
any	4
occasion,	4
or	4
even	4
the	4
semblance	4
of	4
one,	4
for	4
disparagement	4
of	4
her	4
purity	4
and	4
modesty;	4
on	4
the	4
contrary,	4
such	4
and	4
so	4
great	4
is	4
the	4
vigilance	4
with	4
which	4
she	4
watches	4
over	4
her	4
honour,	4
that	4
of	4
all	4
those	4
that	4
court	4
and	4
woo	4
her	4
not	4
one	4
has	4
boasted,	4
or	4
can	4
with	4
truth	4
boast,	4
that	4
she	4
has	4
given	4
him	4
any	4
hope	4
however	4
small	4
of	4
obtaining	4
his	4
desire.	4
For	4
although	4
she	4
does	4
not	4
avoid	4
or	4
shun	4
the	4
society	4
and	4
conversation	4
of	4
the	4
shepherds,	4
and	4
treats	4
them	4
courteously	4
and	4
kindly,	4
should	4
any	4
one	4
of	4
them	4
come	4
to	4
declare	4
his	4
intention	4
to	4
her,	4
though	4
it	4
be	4
one	4
as	4
proper	4
and	4
holy	4
as	4
that	4
of	4
matrimony,	4
she	4
flings	4
him	4
from	4
her	4
like	4
a	4
catapult.	4
And	4
with	4
this	4
kind	4
of	4
disposition	4
she	4
does	4
more	4
harm	4
in	4
this	4
country	4
than	4
if	4
the	4
plague	4
had	4
got	4
into	4
it,	4
for	4
her	4
affability	4
and	4
her	4
beauty	4
draw	4
on	4
the	4
hearts	4
of	4
those	4
that	4
associate	4
with	4
her	4
to	4
love	4
her	4
and	4
to	4
court	4
her,	4
but	4
her	4
scorn	4
and	4
her	4
frankness	4
bring	4
them	4
to	4
the	4
brink	4
of	4
despair;	4
and	4
so	4
they	4
know	4
not	4
what	4
to	4
say	4
save	4
to	4
proclaim	4
her	4
aloud	4
cruel	4
and	4
hard-hearted,	4
and	4
other	4
names	4
of	4
the	4
same	4
sort	4
which	4
well	4
describe	4
the	4
nature	4
of	4
her	4
character;	4
and	4
if	4
you	4
should	4
remain	4
here	4
any	4
time,	4
señor,	4
you	4
would	4
hear	4
these	4
hills	4
and	4
valleys	4
resounding	4
with	4
the	4
laments	4
of	4
the	4
rejected	4
ones	4
who	4
pursue	4
her.	4
Not	4
far	4
from	4
this	4
there	4
is	4
a	4
spot	4
where	4
there	4
are	4
a	4
couple	4
of	4
dozen	4
of	4
tall	4
beeches,	4
and	4
there	4
is	4
not	4
one	4
of	4
them	4
but	4
has	4
carved	4
and	4
written	4
on	4
its	4
smooth	4
bark	4
the	4
name	4
of	4
Marcela,	4
and	4
above	4
some	4
a	4
crown	4
carved	4
on	4
the	4
same	4
tree	4
as	4
though	4
her	4
lover	4
would	4
say	4
more	4
plainly	4
that	4
Marcela	4
wore	4
and	4
deserved	4
that	4
of	4
all	4
human	4
beauty.	4
Here	4
one	4
shepherd	4
is	4
sighing,	4
there	4
another	4
is	4
lamenting;	4
there	4
love	4
songs	4
are	4
heard,	4
here	4
despairing	4
elegies.	4
One	4
will	4
pass	4
all	4
the	4
hours	4
of	4
the	4
night	4
seated	4
at	4
the	4
foot	4
of	4
some	4
oak	4
or	4
rock,	4
and	4
there,	4
without	4
having	4
closed	4
his	4
weeping	4
eyes,	4
the	4
sun	4
finds	4
him	4
in	4
the	4
morning	4
bemused	4
and	4
bereft	4
of	4
sense;	4
and	4
another	4
without	4
relief	4
or	4
respite	4
to	4
his	4
sighs,	4
stretched	4
on	4
the	4
burning	4
sand	4
in	4
the	4
full	4
heat	4
of	4
the	4
sultry	4
summer	4
noontide,	4
makes	4
his	4
appeal	4
to	4
the	4
compassionate	4
heavens,	4
and	4
over	4
one	4
and	4
the	4
other,	4
over	4
these	4
and	4
all,	4
the	4
beautiful	4
Marcela	4
triumphs	4
free	4
and	4
careless.	4
And	4
all	4
of	4
us	4
that	4
know	4
her	4
are	4
waiting	4
to	4
see	4
what	4
her	4
pride	4
will	4
come	4
to,	4
and	4
who	4
is	4
to	4
be	4
the	4
happy	4
man	4
that	4
will	4
succeed	4
in	4
taming	4
a	4
nature	4
so	4
formidable	4
and	4
gaining	4
possession	4
of	4
a	4
beauty	4
so	4
supreme.	4
All	4
that	4
I	4
have	4
told	4
you	4
being	4
such	4
well-established	4
truth,	4
I	4
am	4
persuaded	4
that	4
what	4
they	4
say	4
of	4
the	4
cause	4
of	4
Chrysostom’s	4
death,	4
as	4
our	4
lad	4
told	4
us,	4
is	4
the	4
same.	4
And	4
so	4
I	4
advise	4
you,	4
señor,	4
fail	4
not	4
to	4
be	4
present	4
to-morrow	4
at	4
his	4
burial,	4
which	4
will	4
be	4
well	4
worth	4
seeing,	4
for	4
Chrysostom	4
had	4
many	4
friends,	4
and	4
it	4
is	4
not	4
half	4
a	4
league	4
from	4
this	4
place	4
to	4
where	4
he	4
directed	4
he	4
should	4
be	4
buried.”	4
“I	4
will	4
make	4
a	4
point	4
of	4
it,”	4
said	4
Don	4
Quixote,	4
“and	4
I	4
thank	4
you	4
for	4
the	4
pleasure	4
you	4
have	4
given	4
me	4
by	4
relating	4
so	4
interesting	4
a	4
tale.”	4
“Oh,”	4
said	4
the	4
goatherd,	4
“I	4
do	4
not	4
know	4
even	4
the	4
half	4
of	4
what	4
has	4
happened	4
to	4
the	4
lovers	4
of	4
Marcela,	4
but	4
perhaps	4
to-morrow	4
we	4
may	4
fall	4
in	4
with	4
some	4
shepherd	4
on	4
the	4
road	4
who	4
can	4
tell	4
us;	4
and	4
now	4
it	4
will	4
be	4
well	4
for	4
you	4
to	4
go	4
and	4
sleep	4
under	4
cover,	4
for	4
the	4
night	4
air	4
may	4
hurt	4
your	4
wound,	4
though	4
with	4
the	4
remedy	4
I	4
have	4
applied	4
to	4
you	4
there	4
is	4
no	4
fear	4
of	4
an	4
untoward	4
result.”	4
Sancho	4
Panza,	4
who	4
was	4
wishing	4
the	4
goatherd’s	4
loquacity	4
at	4
the	4
devil,	4
on	4
his	4
part	4
begged	4
his	4
master	4
to	4
go	4
into	4
Pedro’s	4
hut	4
to	4
sleep.	4
He	4
did	4
so,	4
and	4
passed	4
all	4
the	4
rest	4
of	4
the	4
night	4
in	4
thinking	4
of	4
his	4
lady	4
Dulcinea,	4
in	4
imitation	4
of	4
the	4
lovers	4
of	4
Marcela.	4
Sancho	4
Panza	4
settled	4
himself	4
between	4
Rocinante	4
and	4
his	4
ass,	4
and	4
slept,	4
not	4
like	4
a	4
lover	4
who	4
had	4
been	4
discarded,	4
but	4
like	4
a	4
man	4
who	4
had	4
been	4
soundly	4
kicked.	4

hardly	4
had	4
day	4
begun	4
to	4
show	4
itself	4
through	4
the	4
balconies	4
of	4
the	4
east,	4
when	4
five	4
of	4
the	4
six	4
goatherds	4
came	4
to	4
rouse	4
Don	4
Quixote	4
and	4
tell	4
him	4
that	4
if	4
he	4
was	4
still	4
of	4
a	4
mind	4
to	4
go	4
and	4
see	4
the	4
famous	4
burial	4
of	4
Chrysostom	4
they	4
would	4
bear	4
him	4
company.	4
Don	4
Quixote,	4
who	4
desired	4
nothing	4
better,	4
rose	4
and	4
ordered	4
Sancho	4
to	4
saddle	4
and	4
pannel	4
at	4
once,	4
which	4
he	4
did	4
with	4
all	4
despatch,	4
and	4
with	4
the	4
same	4
they	4
all	4
set	4
out	4
forthwith.	4
They	4
had	4
not	4
gone	4
a	4
quarter	4
of	4
a	4
league	4
when	4
at	4
the	4
meeting	4
of	4
two	4
paths	4
they	4
saw	4
coming	4
towards	4
them	4
some	4
six	4
shepherds	4
dressed	4
in	4
black	4
sheepskins	4
and	4
with	4
their	4
heads	4
crowned	4
with	4
garlands	4
of	4
cypress	4
and	4
bitter	4
oleander.	4
Each	4
of	4
them	4
carried	4
a	4
stout	4
holly	4
staff	4
in	4
his	4
hand,	4
and	4
along	4
with	4
them	4
there	4
came	4
two	4
men	4
of	4
quality	4
on	4
horseback	4
in	4
handsome	4
travelling	4
dress,	4
with	4
three	4
servants	4
on	4
foot	4
accompanying	4
them.	4
Courteous	4
salutations	4
were	4
exchanged	4
on	4
meeting,	4
and	4
inquiring	4
one	4
of	4
the	4
other	4
which	4
way	4
each	4
party	4
was	4
going,	4
they	4
learned	4
that	4
all	4
were	4
bound	4
for	4
the	4
scene	4
of	4
the	4
burial,	4
so	4
they	4
went	4
on	4
all	4
together.	4
One	4
of	4
those	4
on	4
horseback	4
addressing	4
his	4
companion	4
said	4
to	4
him,	4
“It	4
seems	4
to	4
me,	4
Señor	4
Vivaldo,	4
that	4
we	4
may	4
reckon	4
as	4
well	4
spent	4
the	4
delay	4
we	4
shall	4
incur	4
in	4
seeing	4
this	4
remarkable	4
funeral,	4
for	4
remarkable	4
it	4
cannot	4
but	4
be	4
judging	4
by	4
the	4
strange	4
things	4
these	4
shepherds	4
have	4
told	4
us,	4
of	4
both	4
the	4
dead	4
shepherd	4
and	4
homicide	4
shepherdess.”	4
“So	4
I	4
think	4
too,”	4
replied	4
Vivaldo,	4
“and	4
I	4
would	4
delay	4
not	4
to	4
say	4
a	4
day,	4
but	4
four,	4
for	4
the	4
sake	4
of	4
seeing	4
it.”	4
Don	4
Quixote	4
asked	4
them	4
what	4
it	4
was	4
they	4
had	4
heard	4
of	4
Marcela	4
and	4
Chrysostom.	4
The	4
traveller	4
answered	4
that	4
the	4
same	4
morning	4
they	4
had	4
met	4
these	4
shepherds,	4
and	4
seeing	4
them	4
dressed	4
in	4
this	4
mournful	4
fashion	4
they	4
had	4
asked	4
them	4
the	4
reason	4
of	4
their	4
appearing	4
in	4
such	4
a	4
guise;	4
which	4
one	4
of	4
them	4
gave,	4
describing	4
the	4
strange	4
behaviour	4
and	4
beauty	4
of	4
a	4
shepherdess	4
called	4
Marcela,	4
and	4
the	4
loves	4
of	4
many	4
who	4
courted	4
her,	4
together	4
with	4
the	4
death	4
of	4
that	4
Chrysostom	4
to	4
whose	4
burial	4
they	4
were	4
going.	4
In	4
short,	4
he	4
repeated	4
all	4
that	4
Pedro	4
had	4
related	4
to	4
Don	4
Quixote.	4
This	4
conversation	4
dropped,	4
and	4
another	4
was	4
commenced	4
by	4
him	4
who	4
was	4
called	4
Vivaldo	4
asking	4
Don	4
Quixote	4
what	4
was	4
the	4
reason	4
that	4
led	4
him	4
to	4
go	4
armed	4
in	4
that	4
fashion	4
in	4
a	4
country	4
so	4
peaceful.	4
To	4
which	4
Don	4
Quixote	4
replied,	4
“The	4
pursuit	4
of	4
my	4
calling	4
does	4
not	4
allow	4
or	4
permit	4
me	4
to	4
go	4
in	4
any	4
other	4
fashion;	4
easy	4
life,	4
enjoyment,	4
and	4
repose	4
were	4
invented	4
for	4
soft	4
courtiers,	4
but	4
toil,	4
unrest,	4
and	4
arms	4
were	4
invented	4
and	4
made	4
for	4
those	4
alone	4
whom	4
the	4
world	4
calls	4
knights-errant,	4
of	4
whom	4
I,	4
though	4
unworthy,	4
am	4
the	4
least	4
of	4
all.”	4
The	4
instant	4
they	4
heard	4
this	4
all	4
set	4
him	4
down	4
as	4
mad,	4
and	4
the	4
better	4
to	4
settle	4
the	4
point	4
and	4
discover	4
what	4
kind	4
of	4
madness	4
his	4
was,	4
Vivaldo	4
proceeded	4
to	4
ask	4
him	4
what	4
knights-errant	4
meant.	4
“Have	4
not	4
your	4
worships,”	4
replied	4
Don	4
Quixote,	4
“read	4
the	4
annals	4
and	4
histories	4
of	4
England,	4
in	4
which	4
are	4
recorded	4
the	4
famous	4
deeds	4
of	4
King	4
Arthur,	4
whom	4
we	4
in	4
our	4
popular	4
Castilian	4
invariably	4
call	4
King	4
Artus,	4
with	4
regard	4
to	4
whom	4
it	4
is	4
an	4
ancient	4
tradition,	4
and	4
commonly	4
received	4
all	4
over	4
that	4
kingdom	4
of	4
Great	4
Britain,	4
that	4
this	4
king	4
did	4
not	4
die,	4
but	4
was	4
changed	4
by	4
magic	4
art	4
into	4
a	4
raven,	4
and	4
that	4
in	4
process	4
of	4
time	4
he	4
is	4
to	4
return	4
to	4
reign	4
and	4
recover	4
his	4
kingdom	4
and	4
sceptre;	4
for	4
which	4
reason	4
it	4
cannot	4
be	4
proved	4
that	4
from	4
that	4
time	4
to	4
this	4
any	4
Englishman	4
ever	4
killed	4
a	4
raven?	4
Well,	4
then,	4
in	4
the	4
time	4
of	4
this	4
good	4
king	4
that	4
famous	4
order	4
of	4
chivalry	4
of	4
the	4
Knights	4
of	4
the	4
Round	4
Table	4
was	4
instituted,	4
and	4
the	4
amour	4
of	4
Don	4
Lancelot	4
of	4
the	4
Lake	4
with	4
the	4
Queen	4
Guinevere	4
occurred,	4
precisely	4
as	4
is	4
there	4
related,	4
the	4
go-between	4
and	4
confidante	4
therein	4
being	4
the	4
highly	4
honourable	4
dame	4
Quintañona,	4
whence	4
came	4
that	4
ballad	4
so	4
well	4
known	4
and	4
widely	4
spread	4
in	4
our	4
Spain—	4
O	4
never	4
surely	4
was	4
there	4
knight	4
So	4
served	4
by	4
hand	4
of	4
dame,	4
As	4
served	4
was	4
he	4
Sir	4
Lancelot	4
hight	4
When	4
he	4
from	4
Britain	4
came—	4
with	4
all	4
the	4
sweet	4
and	4
delectable	4
course	4
of	4
his	4
achievements	4
in	4
love	4
and	4
war.	4
Handed	4
down	4
from	4
that	4
time,	4
then,	4
this	4
order	4
of	4
chivalry	4
went	4
on	4
extending	4
and	4
spreading	4
itself	4
over	4
many	4
and	4
various	4
parts	4
of	4
the	4
world;	4
and	4
in	4
it,	4
famous	4
and	4
renowned	4
for	4
their	4
deeds,	4
were	4
the	4
mighty	4
Amadis	4
of	4
Gaul	4
with	4
all	4
his	4
sons	4
and	4
descendants	4
to	4
the	4
fifth	4
generation,	4
and	4
the	4
valiant	4
Felixmarte	4
of	4
Hircania,	4
and	4
the	4
never	4
sufficiently	4
praised	4
Tirante	4
el	4
Blanco,	4
and	4
in	4
our	4
own	4
days	4
almost	4
we	4
have	4
seen	4
and	4
heard	4
and	4
talked	4
with	4
the	4
invincible	4
knight	4
Don	4
Belianis	4
of	4
Greece.	4
This,	4
then,	4
sirs,	4
is	4
to	4
be	4
a	4
knight-errant,	4
and	4
what	4
I	4
have	4
spoken	4
of	4
is	4
the	4
order	4
of	4
his	4
chivalry,	4
of	4
which,	4
as	4
I	4
have	4
already	4
said,	4
I,	4
though	4
a	4
sinner,	4
have	4
made	4
profession,	4
and	4
what	4
the	4
aforesaid	4
knights	4
professed	4
that	4
same	4
do	4
I	4
profess,	4
and	4
so	4
I	4
go	4
through	4
these	4
solitudes	4
and	4
wilds	4
seeking	4
adventures,	4
resolved	4
in	4
soul	4
to	4
oppose	4
my	4
arm	4
and	4
person	4
to	4
the	4
most	4
perilous	4
that	4
fortune	4
may	4
offer	4
me	4
in	4
aid	4
of	4
the	4
weak	4
and	4
needy.”	4
By	4
these	4
words	4
of	4
his	4
the	4
travellers	4
were	4
able	4
to	4
satisfy	4
themselves	4
of	4
Don	4
Quixote’s	4
being	4
out	4
of	4
his	4
senses	4
and	4
of	4
the	4
form	4
of	4
madness	4
that	4
overmastered	4
him,	4
at	4
which	4
they	4
felt	4
the	4
same	4
astonishment	4
that	4
all	4
felt	4
on	4
first	4
becoming	4
acquainted	4
with	4
it;	4
and	4
Vivaldo,	4
who	4
was	4
a	4
person	4
of	4
great	4
shrewdness	4
and	4
of	4
a	4
lively	4
temperament,	4
in	4
order	4
to	4
beguile	4
the	4
short	4
journey	4
which	4
they	4
said	4
was	4
required	4
to	4
reach	4
the	4
mountain,	4
the	4
scene	4
of	4
the	4
burial,	4
sought	4
to	4
give	4
him	4
an	4
opportunity	4
of	4
going	4
on	4
with	4
his	4
absurdities.	4
So	4
he	4
said	4
to	4
him,	4
“It	4
seems	4
to	4
me,	4
Señor	4
Knight-errant,	4
that	4
your	4
worship	4
has	4
made	4
choice	4
of	4
one	4
of	4
the	4
most	4
austere	4
professions	4
in	4
the	4
world,	4
and	4
I	4
imagine	4
even	4
that	4
of	4
the	4
Carthusian	4
monks	4
is	4
not	4
so	4
austere.”	4
“As	4
austere	4
it	4
may	4
perhaps	4
be,”	4
replied	4
our	4
Don	4
Quixote,	4
“but	4
so	4
necessary	4
for	4
the	4
world	4
I	4
am	4
very	4
much	4
inclined	4
to	4
doubt.	4
For,	4
if	4
the	4
truth	4
is	4
to	4
be	4
told,	4
the	4
soldier	4
who	4
executes	4
what	4
his	4
captain	4
orders	4
does	4
no	4
less	4
than	4
the	4
captain	4
himself	4
who	4
gives	4
the	4
order.	4
My	4
meaning,	4
is,	4
that	4
churchmen	4
in	4
peace	4
and	4
quiet	4
pray	4
to	4
Heaven	4
for	4
the	4
welfare	4
of	4
the	4
world,	4
but	4
we	4
soldiers	4
and	4
knights	4
carry	4
into	4
effect	4
what	4
they	4
pray	4
for,	4
defending	4
it	4
with	4
the	4
might	4
of	4
our	4
arms	4
and	4
the	4
edge	4
of	4
our	4
swords,	4
not	4
under	4
shelter	4
but	4
in	4
the	4
open	4
air,	4
a	4
target	4
for	4
the	4
intolerable	4
rays	4
of	4
the	4
sun	4
in	4
summer	4
and	4
the	4
piercing	4
frosts	4
of	4
winter.	4
Thus	4
are	4
we	4
God’s	4
ministers	4
on	4
earth	4
and	4
the	4
arms	4
by	4
which	4
his	4
justice	4
is	4
done	4
therein.	4
And	4
as	4
the	4
business	4
of	4
war	4
and	4
all	4
that	4
relates	4
and	4
belongs	4
to	4
it	4
cannot	4
be	4
conducted	4
without	4
exceeding	4
great	4
sweat,	4
toil,	4
and	4
exertion,	4
it	4
follows	4
that	4
those	4
who	4
make	4
it	4
their	4
profession	4
have	4
undoubtedly	4
more	4
labour	4
than	4
those	4
who	4
in	4
tranquil	4
peace	4
and	4
quiet	4
are	4
engaged	4
in	4
praying	4
to	4
God	4
to	4
help	4
the	4
weak.	4
I	4
do	4
not	4
mean	4
to	4
say,	4
nor	4
does	4
it	4
enter	4
into	4
my	4
thoughts,	4
that	4
the	4
knight-errant’s	4
calling	4
is	4
as	4
good	4
as	4
that	4
of	4
the	4
monk	4
in	4
his	4
cell;	4
I	4
would	4
merely	4
infer	4
from	4
what	4
I	4
endure	4
myself	4
that	4
it	4
is	4
beyond	4
a	4
doubt	4
a	4
more	4
laborious	4
and	4
a	4
more	4
belaboured	4
one,	4
a	4
hungrier	4
and	4
thirstier,	4
a	4
wretcheder,	4
raggeder,	4
and	4
lousier;	4
for	4
there	4
is	4
no	4
reason	4
to	4
doubt	4
that	4
the	4
knights-errant	4
of	4
yore	4
endured	4
much	4
hardship	4
in	4
the	4
course	4
of	4
their	4
lives.	4
And	4
if	4
some	4
of	4
them	4
by	4
the	4
might	4
of	4
their	4
arms	4
did	4
rise	4
to	4
be	4
emperors,	4
in	4
faith	4
it	4
cost	4
them	4
dear	4
in	4
the	4
matter	4
of	4
blood	4
and	4
sweat;	4
and	4
if	4
those	4
who	4
attained	4
to	4
that	4
rank	4
had	4
not	4
had	4
magicians	4
and	4
sages	4
to	4
help	4
them	4
they	4
would	4
have	4
been	4
completely	4
baulked	4
in	4
their	4
ambition	4
and	4
disappointed	4
in	4
their	4
hopes.”	4
“That	4
is	4
my	4
own	4
opinion,”	4
replied	4
the	4
traveller;	4
“but	4
one	4
thing	4
among	4
many	4
others	4
seems	4
to	4
me	4
very	4
wrong	4
in	4
knights-errant,	4
and	4
that	4
is	4
that	4
when	4
they	4
find	4
themselves	4
about	4
to	4
engage	4
in	4
some	4
mighty	4
and	4
perilous	4
adventure	4
in	4
which	4
there	4
is	4
manifest	4
danger	4
of	4
losing	4
their	4
lives,	4
they	4
never	4
at	4
the	4
moment	4
of	4
engaging	4
in	4
it	4
think	4
of	4
commending	4
themselves	4
to	4
God,	4
as	4
is	4
the	4
duty	4
of	4
every	4
good	4
Christian	4
in	4
like	4
peril;	4
instead	4
of	4
which	4
they	4
commend	4
themselves	4
to	4
their	4
ladies	4
with	4
as	4
much	4
devotion	4
as	4
if	4
these	4
were	4
their	4
gods,	4
a	4
thing	4
which	4
seems	4
to	4
me	4
to	4
savour	4
somewhat	4
of	4
heathenism.”	4
“Sir,”	4
answered	4
Don	4
Quixote,	4
“that	4
cannot	4
be	4
on	4
any	4
account	4
omitted,	4
and	4
the	4
knight-errant	4
would	4
be	4
disgraced	4
who	4
acted	4
otherwise:	4
for	4
it	4
is	4
usual	4
and	4
customary	4
in	4
knight-errantry	4
that	4
the	4
knight-errant,	4
who	4
on	4
engaging	4
in	4
any	4
great	4
feat	4
of	4
arms	4
has	4
his	4
lady	4
before	4
him,	4
should	4
turn	4
his	4
eyes	4
towards	4
her	4
softly	4
and	4
lovingly,	4
as	4
though	4
with	4
them	4
entreating	4
her	4
to	4
favour	4
and	4
protect	4
him	4
in	4
the	4
hazardous	4
venture	4
he	4
is	4
about	4
to	4
undertake,	4
and	4
even	4
though	4
no	4
one	4
hear	4
him,	4
he	4
is	4
bound	4
to	4
say	4
certain	4
words	4
between	4
his	4
teeth,	4
commending	4
himself	4
to	4
her	4
with	4
all	4
his	4
heart,	4
and	4
of	4
this	4
we	4
have	4
innumerable	4
instances	4
in	4
the	4
histories.	4
Nor	4
is	4
it	4
to	4
be	4
supposed	4
from	4
this	4
that	4
they	4
are	4
to	4
omit	4
commending	4
themselves	4
to	4
God,	4
for	4
there	4
will	4
be	4
time	4
and	4
opportunity	4
for	4
doing	4
so	4
while	4
they	4
are	4
engaged	4
in	4
their	4
task.”	4
“For	4
all	4
that,”	4
answered	4
the	4
traveller,	4
“I	4
feel	4
some	4
doubt	4
still,	4
because	4
often	4
I	4
have	4
read	4
how	4
words	4
will	4
arise	4
between	4
two	4
knights-errant,	4
and	4
from	4
one	4
thing	4
to	4
another	4
it	4
comes	4
about	4
that	4
their	4
anger	4
kindles	4
and	4
they	4
wheel	4
their	4
horses	4
round	4
and	4
take	4
a	4
good	4
stretch	4
of	4
field,	4
and	4
then	4
without	4
any	4
more	4
ado	4
at	4
the	4
top	4
of	4
their	4
speed	4
they	4
come	4
to	4
the	4
charge,	4
and	4
in	4
mid-career	4
they	4
are	4
wont	4
to	4
commend	4
themselves	4
to	4
their	4
ladies;	4
and	4
what	4
commonly	4
comes	4
of	4
the	4
encounter	4
is	4
that	4
one	4
falls	4
over	4
the	4
haunches	4
of	4
his	4
horse	4
pierced	4
through	4
and	4
through	4
by	4
his	4
antagonist’s	4
lance,	4
and	4
as	4
for	4
the	4
other,	4
it	4
is	4
only	4
by	4
holding	4
on	4
to	4
the	4
mane	4
of	4
his	4
horse	4
that	4
he	4
can	4
help	4
falling	4
to	4
the	4
ground;	4
but	4
I	4
know	4
not	4
how	4
the	4
dead	4
man	4
had	4
time	4
to	4
commend	4
himself	4
to	4
God	4
in	4
the	4
course	4
of	4
such	4
rapid	4
work	4
as	4
this;	4
it	4
would	4
have	4
been	4
better	4
if	4
those	4
words	4
which	4
he	4
spent	4
in	4
commending	4
himself	4
to	4
his	4
lady	4
in	4
the	4
midst	4
of	4
his	4
career	4
had	4
been	4
devoted	4
to	4
his	4
duty	4
and	4
obligation	4
as	4
a	4
Christian.	4
Moreover,	4
it	4
is	4
my	4
belief	4
that	4
all	4
knights-errant	4
have	4
not	4
ladies	4
to	4
commend	4
themselves	4
to,	4
for	4
they	4
are	4
not	4
all	4
in	4
love.”	4
“That	4
is	4
impossible,”	4
said	4
Don	4
Quixote:	4
“I	4
say	4
it	4
is	4
impossible	4
that	4
there	4
could	4
be	4
a	4
knight-errant	4
without	4
a	4
lady,	4
because	4
to	4
such	4
it	4
is	4
as	4
natural	4
and	4
proper	4
to	4
be	4
in	4
love	4
as	4
to	4
the	4
heavens	4
to	4
have	4
stars:	4
most	4
certainly	4
no	4
history	4
has	4
been	4
seen	4
in	4
which	4
there	4
is	4
to	4
be	4
found	4
a	4
knight-errant	4
without	4
an	4
amour,	4
and	4
for	4
the	4
simple	4
reason	4
that	4
without	4
one	4
he	4
would	4
be	4
held	4
no	4
legitimate	4
knight	4
but	4
a	4
bastard,	4
and	4
one	4
who	4
had	4
gained	4
entrance	4
into	4
the	4
stronghold	4
of	4
the	4
said	4
knighthood,	4
not	4
by	4
the	4
door,	4
but	4
over	4
the	4
wall	4
like	4
a	4
thief	4
and	4
a	4
robber.”	4
“Nevertheless,”	4
said	4
the	4
traveller,	4
“if	4
I	4
remember	4
rightly,	4
I	4
think	4
I	4
have	4
read	4
that	4
Don	4
Galaor,	4
the	4
brother	4
of	4
the	4
valiant	4
Amadis	4
of	4
Gaul,	4
never	4
had	4
any	4
special	4
lady	4
to	4
whom	4
he	4
might	4
commend	4
himself,	4
and	4
yet	4
he	4
was	4
not	4
the	4
less	4
esteemed,	4
and	4
was	4
a	4
very	4
stout	4
and	4
famous	4
knight.”	4
To	4
which	4
our	4
Don	4
Quixote	4
made	4
answer,	4
“Sir,	4
one	4
solitary	4
swallow	4
does	4
not	4
make	4
summer;	4
moreover,	4
I	4
know	4
that	4
knight	4
was	4
in	4
secret	4
very	4
deeply	4
in	4
love;	4
besides	4
which,	4
that	4
way	4
of	4
falling	4
in	4
love	4
with	4
all	4
that	4
took	4
his	4
fancy	4
was	4
a	4
natural	4
propensity	4
which	4
he	4
could	4
not	4
control.	4
But,	4
in	4
short,	4
it	4
is	4
very	4
manifest	4
that	4
he	4
had	4
one	4
alone	4
whom	4
he	4
made	4
mistress	4
of	4
his	4
will,	4
to	4
whom	4
he	4
commended	4
himself	4
very	4
frequently	4
and	4
very	4
secretly,	4
for	4
he	4
prided	4
himself	4
on	4
being	4
a	4
reticent	4
knight.”	4
“Then	4
if	4
it	4
be	4
essential	4
that	4
every	4
knight-errant	4
should	4
be	4
in	4
love,”	4
said	4
the	4
traveller,	4
“it	4
may	4
be	4
fairly	4
supposed	4
that	4
your	4
worship	4
is	4
so,	4
as	4
you	4
are	4
of	4
the	4
order;	4
and	4
if	4
you	4
do	4
not	4
pride	4
yourself	4
on	4
being	4
as	4
reticent	4
as	4
Don	4
Galaor,	4
I	4
entreat	4
you	4
as	4
earnestly	4
as	4
I	4
can,	4
in	4
the	4
name	4
of	4
all	4
this	4
company	4
and	4
in	4
my	4
own,	4
to	4
inform	4
us	4
of	4
the	4
name,	4
country,	4
rank,	4
and	4
beauty	4
of	4
your	4
lady,	4
for	4
she	4
will	4
esteem	4
herself	4
fortunate	4
if	4
all	4
the	4
world	4
knows	4
that	4
she	4
is	4
loved	4
and	4
served	4
by	4
such	4
a	4
knight	4
as	4
your	4
worship	4
seems	4
to	4
be.”	4
At	4
this	4
Don	4
Quixote	4
heaved	4
a	4
deep	4
sigh	4
and	4
said,	4
“I	4
cannot	4
say	4
positively	4
whether	4
my	4
sweet	4
enemy	4
is	4
pleased	4
or	4
not	4
that	4
the	4
world	4
should	4
know	4
I	4
serve	4
her;	4
I	4
can	4
only	4
say	4
in	4
answer	4
to	4
what	4
has	4
been	4
so	4
courteously	4
asked	4
of	4
me,	4
that	4
her	4
name	4
is	4
Dulcinea,	4
her	4
country	4
El	4
Toboso,	4
a	4
village	4
of	4
La	4
Mancha,	4
her	4
rank	4
must	4
be	4
at	4
least	4
that	4
of	4
a	4
princess,	4
since	4
she	4
is	4
my	4
queen	4
and	4
lady,	4
and	4
her	4
beauty	4
superhuman,	4
since	4
all	4
the	4
impossible	4
and	4
fanciful	4
attributes	4
of	4
beauty	4
which	4
the	4
poets	4
apply	4
to	4
their	4
ladies	4
are	4
verified	4
in	4
her;	4
for	4
her	4
hairs	4
are	4
gold,	4
her	4
forehead	4
Elysian	4
fields,	4
her	4
eyebrows	4
rainbows,	4
her	4
eyes	4
suns,	4
her	4
cheeks	4
roses,	4
her	4
lips	4
coral,	4
her	4
teeth	4
pearls,	4
her	4
neck	4
alabaster,	4
her	4
bosom	4
marble,	4
her	4
hands	4
ivory,	4
her	4
fairness	4
snow,	4
and	4
what	4
modesty	4
conceals	4
from	4
sight	4
such,	4
I	4
think	4
and	4
imagine,	4
as	4
rational	4
reflection	4
can	4
only	4
extol,	4
not	4
compare.”	4
“We	4
should	4
like	4
to	4
know	4
her	4
lineage,	4
race,	4
and	4
ancestry,”	4
said	4
Vivaldo.	4
To	4
which	4
Don	4
Quixote	4
replied,	4
“She	4
is	4
not	4
of	4
the	4
ancient	4
Roman	4
Curtii,	4
Caii,	4
or	4
Scipios,	4
nor	4
of	4
the	4
modern	4
Colonnas	4
or	4
Orsini,	4
nor	4
of	4
the	4
Moncadas	4
or	4
Requesenes	4
of	4
Catalonia,	4
nor	4
yet	4
of	4
the	4
Rebellas	4
or	4
Villanovas	4
of	4
Valencia;	4
Palafoxes,	4
Nuzas,	4
Rocabertis,	4
Corellas,	4
Lunas,	4
Alagones,	4
Urreas,	4
Foces,	4
or	4
Gurreas	4
of	4
Aragon;	4
Cerdas,	4
Manriques,	4
Mendozas,	4
or	4
Guzmans	4
of	4
Castile;	4
Alencastros,	4
Pallas,	4
or	4
Meneses	4
of	4
Portugal;	4
but	4
she	4
is	4
of	4
those	4
of	4
El	4
Toboso	4
of	4
La	4
Mancha,	4
a	4
lineage	4
that	4
though	4
modern,	4
may	4
furnish	4
a	4
source	4
of	4
gentle	4
blood	4
for	4
the	4
most	4
illustrious	4
families	4
of	4
the	4
ages	4
that	4
are	4
to	4
come,	4
and	4
this	4
let	4
none	4
dispute	4
with	4
me	4
save	4
on	4
the	4
condition	4
that	4
Zerbino	4
placed	4
at	4
the	4
foot	4
of	4
the	4
trophy	4
of	4
Orlando’s	4
arms,	4
saying,	4
These	4
let	4
none	4
move	4
Who	4
dareth	4
not	4
his	4
might	4
with	4
Roland	4
prove.”	4
“Although	4
mine	4
is	4
of	4
the	4
Cachopins	4
of	4
Laredo,”	4
said	4
the	4
traveller,	4
“I	4
will	4
not	4
venture	4
to	4
compare	4
it	4
with	4
that	4
of	4
El	4
Toboso	4
of	4
La	4
Mancha,	4
though,	4
to	4
tell	4
the	4
truth,	4
no	4
such	4
surname	4
has	4
until	4
now	4
ever	4
reached	4
my	4
ears.”	4
“What!”	4
said	4
Don	4
Quixote,	4
“has	4
that	4
never	4
reached	4
them?”	4
The	4
rest	4
of	4
the	4
party	4
went	4
along	4
listening	4
with	4
great	4
attention	4
to	4
the	4
conversation	4
of	4
the	4
pair,	4
and	4
even	4
the	4
very	4
goatherds	4
and	4
shepherds	4
perceived	4
how	4
exceedingly	4
out	4
of	4
his	4
wits	4
our	4
Don	4
Quixote	4
was.	4
Sancho	4
Panza	4
alone	4
thought	4
that	4
what	4
his	4
master	4
said	4
was	4
the	4
truth,	4
knowing	4
who	4
he	4
was	4
and	4
having	4
known	4
him	4
from	4
his	4
birth;	4
and	4
all	4
that	4
he	4
felt	4
any	4
difficulty	4
in	4
believing	4
was	4
that	4
about	4
the	4
fair	4
Dulcinea	4
del	4
Toboso,	4
because	4
neither	4
any	4
such	4
name	4
nor	4
any	4
such	4
princess	4
had	4
ever	4
come	4
to	4
his	4
knowledge	4
though	4
he	4
lived	4
so	4
close	4
to	4
El	4
Toboso.	4
They	4
were	4
going	4
along	4
conversing	4
in	4
this	4
way,	4
when	4
they	4
saw	4
descending	4
a	4
gap	4
between	4
two	4
high	4
mountains	4
some	4
twenty	4
shepherds,	4
all	4
clad	4
in	4
sheepskins	4
of	4
black	4
wool,	4
and	4
crowned	4
with	4
garlands	4
which,	4
as	4
afterwards	4
appeared,	4
were,	4
some	4
of	4
them	4
of	4
yew,	4
some	4
of	4
cypress.	4
Six	4
of	4
the	4
number	4
were	4
carrying	4
a	4
bier	4
covered	4
with	4
a	4
great	4
variety	4
of	4
flowers	4
and	4
branches,	4
on	4
seeing	4
which	4
one	4
of	4
the	4
goatherds	4
said,	4
“Those	4
who	4
come	4
there	4
are	4
the	4
bearers	4
of	4
Chrysostom’s	4
body,	4
and	4
the	4
foot	4
of	4
that	4
mountain	4
is	4
the	4
place	4
where	4
he	4
ordered	4
them	4
to	4
bury	4
him.”	4
They	4
therefore	4
made	4
haste	4
to	4
reach	4
the	4
spot,	4
and	4
did	4
so	4
by	4
the	4
time	4
those	4
who	4
came	4
had	4
laid	4
the	4
bier	4
upon	4
the	4
ground,	4
and	4
four	4
of	4
them	4
with	4
sharp	4
pickaxes	4
were	4
digging	4
a	4
grave	4
by	4
the	4
side	4
of	4
a	4
hard	4
rock.	4
They	4
greeted	4
each	4
other	4
courteously,	4
and	4
then	4
Don	4
Quixote	4
and	4
those	4
who	4
accompanied	4
him	4
turned	4
to	4
examine	4
the	4
bier,	4
and	4
on	4
it,	4
covered	4
with	4
flowers,	4
they	4
saw	4
a	4
dead	4
body	4
in	4
the	4
dress	4
of	4
a	4
shepherd,	4
to	4
all	4
appearance	4
of	4
one	4
thirty	4
years	4
of	4
age,	4
and	4
showing	4
even	4
in	4
death	4
that	4
in	4
life	4
he	4
had	4
been	4
of	4
comely	4
features	4
and	4
gallant	4
bearing.	4
Around	4
him	4
on	4
the	4
bier	4
itself	4
were	4
laid	4
some	4
books,	4
and	4
several	4
papers	4
open	4
and	4
folded;	4
and	4
those	4
who	4
were	4
looking	4
on	4
as	4
well	4
as	4
those	4
who	4
were	4
opening	4
the	4
grave	4
and	4
all	4
the	4
others	4
who	4
were	4
there	4
preserved	4
a	4
strange	4
silence,	4
until	4
one	4
of	4
those	4
who	4
had	4
borne	4
the	4
body	4
said	4
to	4
another,	4
“Observe	4
carefully,	4
Ambrosia	4
if	4
this	4
is	4
the	4
place	4
Chrysostom	4
spoke	4
of,	4
since	4
you	4
are	4
anxious	4
that	4
what	4
he	4
directed	4
in	4
his	4
will	4
should	4
be	4
so	4
strictly	4
complied	4
with.”	4
“This	4
is	4
the	4
place,”	4
answered	4
Ambrosia	4
“for	4
in	4
it	4
many	4
a	4
time	4
did	4
my	4
poor	4
friend	4
tell	4
me	4
the	4
story	4
of	4
his	4
hard	4
fortune.	4
Here	4
it	4
was,	4
he	4
told	4
me,	4
that	4
he	4
saw	4
for	4
the	4
first	4
time	4
that	4
mortal	4
enemy	4
of	4
the	4
human	4
race,	4
and	4
here,	4
too,	4
for	4
the	4
first	4
time	4
he	4
declared	4
to	4
her	4
his	4
passion,	4
as	4
honourable	4
as	4
it	4
was	4
devoted,	4
and	4
here	4
it	4
was	4
that	4
at	4
last	4
Marcela	4
ended	4
by	4
scorning	4
and	4
rejecting	4
him	4
so	4
as	4
to	4
bring	4
the	4
tragedy	4
of	4
his	4
wretched	4
life	4
to	4
a	4
close;	4
here,	4
in	4
memory	4
of	4
misfortunes	4
so	4
great,	4
he	4
desired	4
to	4
be	4
laid	4
in	4
the	4
bowels	4
of	4
eternal	4
oblivion.”	4
Then	4
turning	4
to	4
Don	4
Quixote	4
and	4
the	4
travellers	4
he	4
went	4
on	4
to	4
say,	4
“That	4
body,	4
sirs,	4
on	4
which	4
you	4
are	4
looking	4
with	4
compassionate	4
eyes,	4
was	4
the	4
abode	4
of	4
a	4
soul	4
on	4
which	4
Heaven	4
bestowed	4
a	4
vast	4
share	4
of	4
its	4
riches.	4
That	4
is	4
the	4
body	4
of	4
Chrysostom,	4
who	4
was	4
unrivalled	4
in	4
wit,	4
unequalled	4
in	4
courtesy,	4
unapproached	4
in	4
gentle	4
bearing,	4
a	4
phœnix	4
in	4
friendship,	4
generous	4
without	4
limit,	4
grave	4
without	4
arrogance,	4
gay	4
without	4
vulgarity,	4
and,	4
in	4
short,	4
first	4
in	4
all	4
that	4
constitutes	4
goodness	4
and	4
second	4
to	4
none	4
in	4
all	4
that	4
makes	4
up	4
misfortune.	4
He	4
loved	4
deeply,	4
he	4
was	4
hated;	4
he	4
adored,	4
he	4
was	4
scorned;	4
he	4
wooed	4
a	4
wild	4
beast,	4
he	4
pleaded	4
with	4
marble,	4
he	4
pursued	4
the	4
wind,	4
he	4
cried	4
to	4
the	4
wilderness,	4
he	4
served	4
ingratitude,	4
and	4
for	4
reward	4
was	4
made	4
the	4
prey	4
of	4
death	4
in	4
the	4
mid-course	4
of	4
life,	4
cut	4
short	4
by	4
a	4
shepherdess	4
whom	4
he	4
sought	4
to	4
immortalise	4
in	4
the	4
memory	4
of	4
man,	4
as	4
these	4
papers	4
which	4
you	4
see	4
could	4
fully	4
prove,	4
had	4
he	4
not	4
commanded	4
me	4
to	4
consign	4
them	4
to	4
the	4
fire	4
after	4
having	4
consigned	4
his	4
body	4
to	4
the	4
earth.”	4
“You	4
would	4
deal	4
with	4
them	4
more	4
harshly	4
and	4
cruelly	4
than	4
their	4
owner	4
himself,”	4
said	4
Vivaldo,	4
“for	4
it	4
is	4
neither	4
right	4
nor	4
proper	4
to	4
do	4
the	4
will	4
of	4
one	4
who	4
enjoins	4
what	4
is	4
wholly	4
unreasonable;	4
it	4
would	4
not	4
have	4
been	4
reasonable	4
in	4
Augustus	4
Cæsar	4
had	4
he	4
permitted	4
the	4
directions	4
left	4
by	4
the	4
divine	4
Mantuan	4
in	4
his	4
will	4
to	4
be	4
carried	4
into	4
effect.	4
So	4
that,	4
Señor	4
Ambrosia	4
while	4
you	4
consign	4
your	4
friend’s	4
body	4
to	4
the	4
earth,	4
you	4
should	4
not	4
consign	4
his	4
writings	4
to	4
oblivion,	4
for	4
if	4
he	4
gave	4
the	4
order	4
in	4
bitterness	4
of	4
heart,	4
it	4
is	4
not	4
right	4
that	4
you	4
should	4
irrationally	4
obey	4
it.	4
On	4
the	4
contrary,	4
by	4
granting	4
life	4
to	4
those	4
papers,	4
let	4
the	4
cruelty	4
of	4
Marcela	4
live	4
for	4
ever,	4
to	4
serve	4
as	4
a	4
warning	4
in	4
ages	4
to	4
come	4
to	4
all	4
men	4
to	4
shun	4
and	4
avoid	4
falling	4
into	4
like	4
danger;	4
or	4
I	4
and	4
all	4
of	4
us	4
who	4
have	4
come	4
here	4
know	4
already	4
the	4
story	4
of	4
this	4
your	4
love-stricken	4
and	4
heart-broken	4
friend,	4
and	4
we	4
know,	4
too,	4
your	4
friendship,	4
and	4
the	4
cause	4
of	4
his	4
death,	4
and	4
the	4
directions	4
he	4
gave	4
at	4
the	4
close	4
of	4
his	4
life;	4
from	4
which	4
sad	4
story	4
may	4
be	4
gathered	4
how	4
great	4
was	4
the	4
cruelty	4
of	4
Marcela,	4
the	4
love	4
of	4
Chrysostom,	4
and	4
the	4
loyalty	4
of	4
your	4
friendship,	4
together	4
with	4
the	4
end	4
awaiting	4
those	4
who	4
pursue	4
rashly	4
the	4
path	4
that	4
insane	4
passion	4
opens	4
to	4
their	4
eyes.	4
Last	4
night	4
we	4
learned	4
the	4
death	4
of	4
Chrysostom	4
and	4
that	4
he	4
was	4
to	4
be	4
buried	4
here,	4
and	4
out	4
of	4
curiosity	4
and	4
pity	4
we	4
left	4
our	4
direct	4
road	4
and	4
resolved	4
to	4
come	4
and	4
see	4
with	4
our	4
eyes	4
that	4
which	4
when	4
heard	4
of	4
had	4
so	4
moved	4
our	4
compassion,	4
and	4
in	4
consideration	4
of	4
that	4
compassion	4
and	4
our	4
desire	4
to	4
prove	4
it	4
if	4
we	4
might	4
by	4
condolence,	4
we	4
beg	4
of	4
you,	4
excellent	4
Ambrosia,	4
or	4
at	4
least	4
I	4
on	4
my	4
own	4
account	4
entreat	4
you,	4
that	4
instead	4
of	4
burning	4
those	4
papers	4
you	4
allow	4
me	4
to	4
carry	4
away	4
some	4
of	4
them.”	4
And	4
without	4
waiting	4
for	4
the	4
shepherd’s	4
answer,	4
he	4
stretched	4
out	4
his	4
hand	4
and	4
took	4
up	4
some	4
of	4
those	4
that	4
were	4
nearest	4
to	4
him;	4
seeing	4
which	4
Ambrosio	4
said,	4
“Out	4
of	4
courtesy,	4
señor,	4
I	4
will	4
grant	4
your	4
request	4
as	4
to	4
those	4
you	4
have	4
taken,	4
but	4
it	4
is	4
idle	4
to	4
expect	4
me	4
to	4
abstain	4
from	4
burning	4
the	4
remainder.”	4
Vivaldo,	4
who	4
was	4
eager	4
to	4
see	4
what	4
the	4
papers	4
contained,	4
opened	4
one	4
of	4
them	4
at	4
once,	4
and	4
saw	4
that	4
its	4
title	4
was	4
“Lay	4
of	4
Despair.”	4
Ambrosio	4
hearing	4
it	4
said,	4
“That	4
is	4
the	4
last	4
paper	4
the	4
unhappy	4
man	4
wrote;	4
and	4
that	4
you	4
may	4
see,	4
señor,	4
to	4
what	4
an	4
end	4
his	4
misfortunes	4
brought	4
him,	4
read	4
it	4
so	4
that	4
you	4
may	4
be	4
heard,	4
for	4
you	4
will	4
have	4
time	4
enough	4
for	4
that	4
while	4
we	4
are	4
waiting	4
for	4
the	4
grave	4
to	4
be	4
dug.”	4
“I	4
will	4
do	4
so	4
very	4
willingly,”	4
said	4
Vivaldo;	4
and	4
as	4
all	4
the	4
bystanders	4
were	4
equally	4
eager	4
they	4
gathered	4
round	4
him,	4
and	4
he,	4
reading	4
in	4
a	4
loud	4
voice,	4
found	4
that	4
it	4
ran	4
as	4
follows.	4

THE	4
LAY	4
OF	4
CHRYSOSTOM	4
Since	4
thou	4
dost	4
in	4
thy	4
cruelty	4
desire	4
The	4
ruthless	4
rigour	4
of	4
thy	4
tyranny	4
From	4
tongue	4
to	4
tongue,	4
from	4
land	4
to	4
land	4
proclaimed,	4
The	4
very	4
Hell	4
will	4
I	4
constrain	4
to	4
lend	4
This	4
stricken	4
breast	4
of	4
mine	4
deep	4
notes	4
of	4
woe	4
To	4
serve	4
my	4
need	4
of	4
fitting	4
utterance.	4
And	4
as	4
I	4
strive	4
to	4
body	4
forth	4
the	4
tale	4
Of	4
all	4
I	4
suffer,	4
all	4
that	4
thou	4
hast	4
done,	4
Forth	4
shall	4
the	4
dread	4
voice	4
roll,	4
and	4
bear	4
along	4
Shreds	4
from	4
my	4
vitals	4
torn	4
for	4
greater	4
pain.	4
Then	4
listen,	4
not	4
to	4
dulcet	4
harmony,	4
But	4
to	4
a	4
discord	4
wrung	4
by	4
mad	4
despair	4
Out	4
of	4
this	4
bosom’s	4
depths	4
of	4
bitterness,	4
To	4
ease	4
my	4
heart	4
and	4
plant	4
a	4
sting	4
in	4
thine.	4
The	4
lion’s	4
roar,	4
the	4
fierce	4
wolf’s	4
savage	4
howl,	4
The	4
horrid	4
hissing	4
of	4
the	4
scaly	4
snake,	4
The	4
awesome	4
cries	4
of	4
monsters	4
yet	4
unnamed,	4
The	4
crow’s	4
ill-boding	4
croak,	4
the	4
hollow	4
moan	4
Of	4
wild	4
winds	4
wrestling	4
with	4
the	4
restless	4
sea,	4
The	4
wrathful	4
bellow	4
of	4
the	4
vanquished	4
bull,	4
The	4
plaintive	4
sobbing	4
of	4
the	4
widowed	4
dove,	4
The	4
envied	4
owl’s	4
sad	4
note,	4
the	4
wail	4
of	4
woe	4
That	4
rises	4
from	4
the	4
dreary	4
choir	4
of	4
Hell,	4
Commingled	4
in	4
one	4
sound,	4
confusing	4
sense,	4
Let	4
all	4
these	4
come	4
to	4
aid	4
my	4
soul’s	4
complaint,	4
For	4
pain	4
like	4
mine	4
demands	4
new	4
modes	4
of	4
song.	4
No	4
echoes	4
of	4
that	4
discord	4
shall	4
be	4
heard	4
Where	4
Father	4
Tagus	4
rolls,	4
or	4
on	4
the	4
banks	4
Of	4
olive-bordered	4
Betis;	4
to	4
the	4
rocks	4
Or	4
in	4
deep	4
caverns	4
shall	4
my	4
plaint	4
be	4
told,	4
And	4
by	4
a	4
lifeless	4
tongue	4
in	4
living	4
words;	4
Or	4
in	4
dark	4
valleys	4
or	4
on	4
lonely	4
shores,	4
Where	4
neither	4
foot	4
of	4
man	4
nor	4
sunbeam	4
falls;	4
Or	4
in	4
among	4
the	4
poison-breathing	4
swarms	4
Of	4
monsters	4
nourished	4
by	4
the	4
sluggish	4
Nile.	4
For,	4
though	4
it	4
be	4
to	4
solitudes	4
remote	4
The	4
hoarse	4
vague	4
echoes	4
of	4
my	4
sorrows	4
sound	4
Thy	4
matchless	4
cruelty,	4
my	4
dismal	4
fate	4
Shall	4
carry	4
them	4
to	4
all	4
the	4
spacious	4
world.	4
Disdain	4
hath	4
power	4
to	4
kill,	4
and	4
patience	4
dies	4
Slain	4
by	4
suspicion,	4
be	4
it	4
false	4
or	4
true;	4
And	4
deadly	4
is	4
the	4
force	4
of	4
jealousy;	4
Long	4
absence	4
makes	4
of	4
life	4
a	4
dreary	4
void;	4
No	4
hope	4
of	4
happiness	4
can	4
give	4
repose	4
To	4
him	4
that	4
ever	4
fears	4
to	4
be	4
forgot;	4
And	4
death,	4
inevitable,	4
waits	4
in	4
hall.	4
But	4
I,	4
by	4
some	4
strange	4
miracle,	4
live	4
on	4
A	4
prey	4
to	4
absence,	4
jealousy,	4
disdain;	4
Racked	4
by	4
suspicion	4
as	4
by	4
certainty;	4
Forgotten,	4
left	4
to	4
feed	4
my	4
flame	4
alone.	4
And	4
while	4
I	4
suffer	4
thus,	4
there	4
comes	4
no	4
ray	4
Of	4
hope	4
to	4
gladden	4
me	4
athwart	4
the	4
gloom;	4
Nor	4
do	4
I	4
look	4
for	4
it	4
in	4
my	4
despair;	4
But	4
rather	4
clinging	4
to	4
a	4
cureless	4
woe,	4
All	4
hope	4
do	4
I	4
abjure	4
for	4
evermore.	4
Can	4
there	4
be	4
hope	4
where	4
fear	4
is?	4
Were	4
it	4
well,	4
When	4
far	4
more	4
certain	4
are	4
the	4
grounds	4
of	4
fear?	4
Ought	4
I	4
to	4
shut	4
mine	4
eyes	4
to	4
jealousy,	4
If	4
through	4
a	4
thousand	4
heart-wounds	4
it	4
appears?	4
Who	4
would	4
not	4
give	4
free	4
access	4
to	4
distrust,	4
Seeing	4
disdain	4
unveiled,	4
and—bitter	4
change!—	4
All	4
his	4
suspicions	4
turned	4
to	4
certainties,	4
And	4
the	4
fair	4
truth	4
transformed	4
into	4
a	4
lie?	4
Oh,	4
thou	4
fierce	4
tyrant	4
of	4
the	4
realms	4
of	4
love,	4
Oh,	4
Jealousy!	4
put	4
chains	4
upon	4
these	4
hands,	4
And	4
bind	4
me	4
with	4
thy	4
strongest	4
cord,	4
Disdain.	4
But,	4
woe	4
is	4
me!	4
triumphant	4
over	4
all,	4
My	4
sufferings	4
drown	4
the	4
memory	4
of	4
you.	4
And	4
now	4
I	4
die,	4
and	4
since	4
there	4
is	4
no	4
hope	4
Of	4
happiness	4
for	4
me	4
in	4
life	4
or	4
death,	4
Still	4
to	4
my	4
fantasy	4
I’ll	4
fondly	4
cling.	4
I’ll	4
say	4
that	4
he	4
is	4
wise	4
who	4
loveth	4
well,	4
And	4
that	4
the	4
soul	4
most	4
free	4
is	4
that	4
most	4
bound	4
In	4
thraldom	4
to	4
the	4
ancient	4
tyrant	4
Love.	4
I’ll	4
say	4
that	4
she	4
who	4
is	4
mine	4
enemy	4
In	4
that	4
fair	4
body	4
hath	4
as	4
fair	4
a	4
mind,	4
And	4
that	4
her	4
coldness	4
is	4
but	4
my	4
desert,	4
And	4
that	4
by	4
virtue	4
of	4
the	4
pain	4
he	4
sends	4
Love	4
rules	4
his	4
kingdom	4
with	4
a	4
gentle	4
sway.	4
Thus,	4
self-deluding,	4
and	4
in	4
bondage	4
sore,	4
And	4
wearing	4
out	4
the	4
wretched	4
shred	4
of	4
life	4
To	4
which	4
I	4
am	4
reduced	4
by	4
her	4
disdain,	4
I’ll	4
give	4
this	4
soul	4
and	4
body	4
to	4
the	4
winds,	4
All	4
hopeless	4
of	4
a	4
crown	4
of	4
bliss	4
in	4
store.	4
Thou	4
whose	4
injustice	4
hath	4
supplied	4
the	4
cause	4
That	4
makes	4
me	4
quit	4
the	4
weary	4
life	4
I	4
loathe,	4
As	4
by	4
this	4
wounded	4
bosom	4
thou	4
canst	4
see	4
How	4
willingly	4
thy	4
victim	4
I	4
become,	4
Let	4
not	4
my	4
death,	4
if	4
haply	4
worth	4
a	4
tear,	4
Cloud	4
the	4
clear	4
heaven	4
that	4
dwells	4
in	4
thy	4
bright	4
eyes;	4
I	4
would	4
not	4
have	4
thee	4
expiate	4
in	4
aught	4
The	4
crime	4
of	4
having	4
made	4
my	4
heart	4
thy	4
prey;	4
But	4
rather	4
let	4
thy	4
laughter	4
gaily	4
ring	4
And	4
prove	4
my	4
death	4
to	4
be	4
thy	4
festival.	4
Fool	4
that	4
I	4
am	4
to	4
bid	4
thee!	4
well	4
I	4
know	4
Thy	4
glory	4
gains	4
by	4
my	4
untimely	4
end.	4
And	4
now	4
it	4
is	4
the	4
time;	4
from	4
Hell’s	4
abyss	4
Come	4
thirsting	4
Tantalus,	4
come	4
Sisyphus	4
Heaving	4
the	4
cruel	4
stone,	4
come	4
Tityus	4
With	4
vulture,	4
and	4
with	4
wheel	4
Ixion	4
come,	4
And	4
come	4
the	4
sisters	4
of	4
the	4
ceaseless	4
toil;	4
And	4
all	4
into	4
this	4
breast	4
transfer	4
their	4
pains,	4
And	4
(if	4
such	4
tribute	4
to	4
despair	4
be	4
due)	4
Chant	4
in	4
their	4
deepest	4
tones	4
a	4
doleful	4
dirge	4
Over	4
a	4
corse	4
unworthy	4
of	4
a	4
shroud.	4
Let	4
the	4
three-headed	4
guardian	4
of	4
the	4
gate,	4
And	4
all	4
the	4
monstrous	4
progeny	4
of	4
hell,	4
The	4
doleful	4
concert	4
join:	4
a	4
lover	4
dead	4
Methinks	4
can	4
have	4
no	4
fitter	4
obsequies.	4
Lay	4
of	4
despair,	4
grieve	4
not	4
when	4
thou	4
art	4
gone	4
Forth	4
from	4
this	4
sorrowing	4
heart:	4
my	4
misery	4
Brings	4
fortune	4
to	4
the	4
cause	4
that	4
gave	4
thee	4
birth;	4
Then	4
banish	4
sadness	4
even	4
in	4
the	4
tomb.	4
The	4
“Lay	4
of	4
Chrysostom”	4
met	4
with	4
the	4
approbation	4
of	4
the	4
listeners,	4
though	4
the	4
reader	4
said	4
it	4
did	4
not	4
seem	4
to	4
him	4
to	4
agree	4
with	4
what	4
he	4
had	4
heard	4
of	4
Marcela’s	4
reserve	4
and	4
propriety,	4
for	4
Chrysostom	4
complained	4
in	4
it	4
of	4
jealousy,	4
suspicion,	4
and	4
absence,	4
all	4
to	4
the	4
prejudice	4
of	4
the	4
good	4
name	4
and	4
fame	4
of	4
Marcela;	4
to	4
which	4
Ambrosio	4
replied	4
as	4
one	4
who	4
knew	4
well	4
his	4
friend’s	4
most	4
secret	4
thoughts,	4
“Señor,	4
to	4
remove	4
that	4
doubt	4
I	4
should	4
tell	4
you	4
that	4
when	4
the	4
unhappy	4
man	4
wrote	4
this	4
lay	4
he	4
was	4
away	4
from	4
Marcela,	4
from	4
whom	4
he	4
had	4
voluntarily	4
separated	4
himself,	4
to	4
try	4
if	4
absence	4
would	4
act	4
with	4
him	4
as	4
it	4
is	4
wont;	4
and	4
as	4
everything	4
distresses	4
and	4
every	4
fear	4
haunts	4
the	4
banished	4
lover,	4
so	4
imaginary	4
jealousies	4
and	4
suspicions,	4
dreaded	4
as	4
if	4
they	4
were	4
true,	4
tormented	4
Chrysostom;	4
and	4
thus	4
the	4
truth	4
of	4
what	4
report	4
declares	4
of	4
the	4
virtue	4
of	4
Marcela	4
remains	4
unshaken,	4
and	4
with	4
her	4
envy	4
itself	4
should	4
not	4
and	4
cannot	4
find	4
any	4
fault	4
save	4
that	4
of	4
being	4
cruel,	4
somewhat	4
haughty,	4
and	4
very	4
scornful.”	4
“That	4
is	4
true,”	4
said	4
Vivaldo;	4
and	4
as	4
he	4
was	4
about	4
to	4
read	4
another	4
paper	4
of	4
those	4
he	4
had	4
preserved	4
from	4
the	4
fire,	4
he	4
was	4
stopped	4
by	4
a	4
marvellous	4
vision	4
(for	4
such	4
it	4
seemed)	4
that	4
unexpectedly	4
presented	4
itself	4
to	4
their	4
eyes;	4
for	4
on	4
the	4
summit	4
of	4
the	4
rock	4
where	4
they	4
were	4
digging	4
the	4
grave	4
there	4
appeared	4
the	4
shepherdess	4
Marcela,	4
so	4
beautiful	4
that	4
her	4
beauty	4
exceeded	4
its	4
reputation.	4
Those	4
who	4
had	4
never	4
till	4
then	4
beheld	4
her	4
gazed	4
upon	4
her	4
in	4
wonder	4
and	4
silence,	4
and	4
those	4
who	4
were	4
accustomed	4
to	4
see	4
her	4
were	4
not	4
less	4
amazed	4
than	4
those	4
who	4
had	4
never	4
seen	4
her	4
before.	4
But	4
the	4
instant	4
Ambrosio	4
saw	4
her	4
he	4
addressed	4
her,	4
with	4
manifest	4
indignation:	4
“Art	4
thou	4
come,	4
by	4
chance,	4
cruel	4
basilisk	4
of	4
these	4
mountains,	4
to	4
see	4
if	4
in	4
thy	4
presence	4
blood	4
will	4
flow	4
from	4
the	4
wounds	4
of	4
this	4
wretched	4
being	4
thy	4
cruelty	4
has	4
robbed	4
of	4
life;	4
or	4
is	4
it	4
to	4
exult	4
over	4
the	4
cruel	4
work	4
of	4
thy	4
humours	4
that	4
thou	4
art	4
come;	4
or	4
like	4
another	4
pitiless	4
Nero	4
to	4
look	4
down	4
from	4
that	4
height	4
upon	4
the	4
ruin	4
of	4
his	4
Rome	4
in	4
embers;	4
or	4
in	4
thy	4
arrogance	4
to	4
trample	4
on	4
this	4
ill-fated	4
corpse,	4
as	4
the	4
ungrateful	4
daughter	4
trampled	4
on	4
her	4
father	4
Tarquin’s?	4
Tell	4
us	4
quickly	4
for	4
what	4
thou	4
art	4
come,	4
or	4
what	4
it	4
is	4
thou	4
wouldst	4
have,	4
for,	4
as	4
I	4
know	4
the	4
thoughts	4
of	4
Chrysostom	4
never	4
failed	4
to	4
obey	4
thee	4
in	4
life,	4
I	4
will	4
make	4
all	4
these	4
who	4
call	4
themselves	4
his	4
friends	4
obey	4
thee,	4
though	4
he	4
be	4
dead.”	4
“I	4
come	4
not,	4
Ambrosia	4
for	4
any	4
of	4
the	4
purposes	4
thou	4
hast	4
named,”	4
replied	4
Marcela,	4
“but	4
to	4
defend	4
myself	4
and	4
to	4
prove	4
how	4
unreasonable	4
are	4
all	4
those	4
who	4
blame	4
me	4
for	4
their	4
sorrow	4
and	4
for	4
Chrysostom’s	4
death;	4
and	4
therefore	4
I	4
ask	4
all	4
of	4
you	4
that	4
are	4
here	4
to	4
give	4
me	4
your	4
attention,	4
for	4
it	4
will	4
not	4
take	4
much	4
time	4
or	4
many	4
words	4
to	4
bring	4
the	4
truth	4
home	4
to	4
persons	4
of	4
sense.	4
Heaven	4
has	4
made	4
me,	4
so	4
you	4
say,	4
beautiful,	4
and	4
so	4
much	4
so	4
that	4
in	4
spite	4
of	4
yourselves	4
my	4
beauty	4
leads	4
you	4
to	4
love	4
me;	4
and	4
for	4
the	4
love	4
you	4
show	4
me	4
you	4
say,	4
and	4
even	4
urge,	4
that	4
I	4
am	4
bound	4
to	4
love	4
you.	4
By	4
that	4
natural	4
understanding	4
which	4
God	4
has	4
given	4
me	4
I	4
know	4
that	4
everything	4
beautiful	4
attracts	4
love,	4
but	4
I	4
cannot	4
see	4
how,	4
by	4
reason	4
of	4
being	4
loved,	4
that	4
which	4
is	4
loved	4
for	4
its	4
beauty	4
is	4
bound	4
to	4
love	4
that	4
which	4
loves	4
it;	4
besides,	4
it	4
may	4
happen	4
that	4
the	4
lover	4
of	4
that	4
which	4
is	4
beautiful	4
may	4
be	4
ugly,	4
and	4
ugliness	4
being	4
detestable,	4
it	4
is	4
very	4
absurd	4
to	4
say,	4
“I	4
love	4
thee	4
because	4
thou	4
art	4
beautiful,	4
thou	4
must	4
love	4
me	4
though	4
I	4
be	4
ugly.”	4
But	4
supposing	4
the	4
beauty	4
equal	4
on	4
both	4
sides,	4
it	4
does	4
not	4
follow	4
that	4
the	4
inclinations	4
must	4
be	4
therefore	4
alike,	4
for	4
it	4
is	4
not	4
every	4
beauty	4
that	4
excites	4
love,	4
some	4
but	4
pleasing	4
the	4
eye	4
without	4
winning	4
the	4
affection;	4
and	4
if	4
every	4
sort	4
of	4
beauty	4
excited	4
love	4
and	4
won	4
the	4
heart,	4
the	4
will	4
would	4
wander	4
vaguely	4
to	4
and	4
fro	4
unable	4
to	4
make	4
choice	4
of	4
any;	4
for	4
as	4
there	4
is	4
an	4
infinity	4
of	4
beautiful	4
objects	4
there	4
must	4
be	4
an	4
infinity	4
of	4
inclinations,	4
and	4
true	4
love,	4
I	4
have	4
heard	4
it	4
said,	4
is	4
indivisible,	4
and	4
must	4
be	4
voluntary	4
and	4
not	4
compelled.	4
If	4
this	4
be	4
so,	4
as	4
I	4
believe	4
it	4
to	4
be,	4
why	4
do	4
you	4
desire	4
me	4
to	4
bend	4
my	4
will	4
by	4
force,	4
for	4
no	4
other	4
reason	4
but	4
that	4
you	4
say	4
you	4
love	4
me?	4
Nay—tell	4
me—had	4
Heaven	4
made	4
me	4
ugly,	4
as	4
it	4
has	4
made	4
me	4
beautiful,	4
could	4
I	4
with	4
justice	4
complain	4
of	4
you	4
for	4
not	4
loving	4
me?	4
Moreover,	4
you	4
must	4
remember	4
that	4
the	4
beauty	4
I	4
possess	4
was	4
no	4
choice	4
of	4
mine,	4
for,	4
be	4
it	4
what	4
it	4
may,	4
Heaven	4
of	4
its	4
bounty	4
gave	4
it	4
me	4
without	4
my	4
asking	4
or	4
choosing	4
it;	4
and	4
as	4
the	4
viper,	4
though	4
it	4
kills	4
with	4
it,	4
does	4
not	4
deserve	4
to	4
be	4
blamed	4
for	4
the	4
poison	4
it	4
carries,	4
as	4
it	4
is	4
a	4
gift	4
of	4
nature,	4
neither	4
do	4
I	4
deserve	4
reproach	4
for	4
being	4
beautiful;	4
for	4
beauty	4
in	4
a	4
modest	4
woman	4
is	4
like	4
fire	4
at	4
a	4
distance	4
or	4
a	4
sharp	4
sword;	4
the	4
one	4
does	4
not	4
burn,	4
the	4
other	4
does	4
not	4
cut,	4
those	4
who	4
do	4
not	4
come	4
too	4
near.	4
Honour	4
and	4
virtue	4
are	4
the	4
ornaments	4
of	4
the	4
mind,	4
without	4
which	4
the	4
body,	4
though	4
it	4
be	4
so,	4
has	4
no	4
right	4
to	4
pass	4
for	4
beautiful;	4
but	4
if	4
modesty	4
is	4
one	4
of	4
the	4
virtues	4
that	4
specially	4
lend	4
a	4
grace	4
and	4
charm	4
to	4
mind	4
and	4
body,	4
why	4
should	4
she	4
who	4
is	4
loved	4
for	4
her	4
beauty	4
part	4
with	4
it	4
to	4
gratify	4
one	4
who	4
for	4
his	4
pleasure	4
alone	4
strives	4
with	4
all	4
his	4
might	4
and	4
energy	4
to	4
rob	4
her	4
of	4
it?	4
I	4
was	4
born	4
free,	4
and	4
that	4
I	4
might	4
live	4
in	4
freedom	4
I	4
chose	4
the	4
solitude	4
of	4
the	4
fields;	4
in	4
the	4
trees	4
of	4
the	4
mountains	4
I	4
find	4
society,	4
the	4
clear	4
waters	4
of	4
the	4
brooks	4
are	4
my	4
mirrors,	4
and	4
to	4
the	4
trees	4
and	4
waters	4
I	4
make	4
known	4
my	4
thoughts	4
and	4
charms.	4
I	4
am	4
a	4
fire	4
afar	4
off,	4
a	4
sword	4
laid	4
aside.	4
Those	4
whom	4
I	4
have	4
inspired	4
with	4
love	4
by	4
letting	4
them	4
see	4
me,	4
I	4
have	4
by	4
words	4
undeceived,	4
and	4
if	4
their	4
longings	4
live	4
on	4
hope—and	4
I	4
have	4
given	4
none	4
to	4
Chrysostom	4
or	4
to	4
any	4
other—it	4
cannot	4
justly	4
be	4
said	4
that	4
the	4
death	4
of	4
any	4
is	4
my	4
doing,	4
for	4
it	4
was	4
rather	4
his	4
own	4
obstinacy	4
than	4
my	4
cruelty	4
that	4
killed	4
him;	4
and	4
if	4
it	4
be	4
made	4
a	4
charge	4
against	4
me	4
that	4
his	4
wishes	4
were	4
honourable,	4
and	4
that	4
therefore	4
I	4
was	4
bound	4
to	4
yield	4
to	4
them,	4
I	4
answer	4
that	4
when	4
on	4
this	4
very	4
spot	4
where	4
now	4
his	4
grave	4
is	4
made	4
he	4
declared	4
to	4
me	4
his	4
purity	4
of	4
purpose,	4
I	4
told	4
him	4
that	4
mine	4
was	4
to	4
live	4
in	4
perpetual	4
solitude,	4
and	4
that	4
the	4
earth	4
alone	4
should	4
enjoy	4
the	4
fruits	4
of	4
my	4
retirement	4
and	4
the	4
spoils	4
of	4
my	4
beauty;	4
and	4
if,	4
after	4
this	4
open	4
avowal,	4
he	4
chose	4
to	4
persist	4
against	4
hope	4
and	4
steer	4
against	4
the	4
wind,	4
what	4
wonder	4
is	4
it	4
that	4
he	4
should	4
sink	4
in	4
the	4
depths	4
of	4
his	4
infatuation?	4
If	4
I	4
had	4
encouraged	4
him,	4
I	4
should	4
be	4
false;	4
if	4
I	4
had	4
gratified	4
him,	4
I	4
should	4
have	4
acted	4
against	4
my	4
own	4
better	4
resolution	4
and	4
purpose.	4
He	4
was	4
persistent	4
in	4
spite	4
of	4
warning,	4
he	4
despaired	4
without	4
being	4
hated.	4
Bethink	4
you	4
now	4
if	4
it	4
be	4
reasonable	4
that	4
his	4
suffering	4
should	4
be	4
laid	4
to	4
my	4
charge.	4
Let	4
him	4
who	4
has	4
been	4
deceived	4
complain,	4
let	4
him	4
give	4
way	4
to	4
despair	4
whose	4
encouraged	4
hopes	4
have	4
proved	4
vain,	4
let	4
him	4
flatter	4
himself	4
whom	4
I	4
shall	4
entice,	4
let	4
him	4
boast	4
whom	4
I	4
shall	4
receive;	4
but	4
let	4
not	4
him	4
call	4
me	4
cruel	4
or	4
homicide	4
to	4
whom	4
I	4
make	4
no	4
promise,	4
upon	4
whom	4
I	4
practise	4
no	4
deception,	4
whom	4
I	4
neither	4
entice	4
nor	4
receive.	4
It	4
has	4
not	4
been	4
so	4
far	4
the	4
will	4
of	4
Heaven	4
that	4
I	4
should	4
love	4
by	4
fate,	4
and	4
to	4
expect	4
me	4
to	4
love	4
by	4
choice	4
is	4
idle.	4
Let	4
this	4
general	4
declaration	4
serve	4
for	4
each	4
of	4
my	4
suitors	4
on	4
his	4
own	4
account,	4
and	4
let	4
it	4
be	4
understood	4
from	4
this	4
time	4
forth	4
that	4
if	4
anyone	4
dies	4
for	4
me	4
it	4
is	4
not	4
of	4
jealousy	4
or	4
misery	4
he	4
dies,	4
for	4
she	4
who	4
loves	4
no	4
one	4
can	4
give	4
no	4
cause	4
for	4
jealousy	4
to	4
any,	4
and	4
candour	4
is	4
not	4
to	4
be	4
confounded	4
with	4
scorn.	4
Let	4
him	4
who	4
calls	4
me	4
wild	4
beast	4
and	4
basilisk,	4
leave	4
me	4
alone	4
as	4
something	4
noxious	4
and	4
evil;	4
let	4
him	4
who	4
calls	4
me	4
ungrateful,	4
withhold	4
his	4
service;	4
who	4
calls	4
me	4
wayward,	4
seek	4
not	4
my	4
acquaintance;	4
who	4
calls	4
me	4
cruel,	4
pursue	4
me	4
not;	4
for	4
this	4
wild	4
beast,	4
this	4
basilisk,	4
this	4
ungrateful,	4
cruel,	4
wayward	4
being	4
has	4
no	4
kind	4
of	4
desire	4
to	4
seek,	4
serve,	4
know,	4
or	4
follow	4
them.	4
If	4
Chrysostom’s	4
impatience	4
and	4
violent	4
passion	4
killed	4
him,	4
why	4
should	4
my	4
modest	4
behaviour	4
and	4
circumspection	4
be	4
blamed?	4
If	4
I	4
preserve	4
my	4
purity	4
in	4
the	4
society	4
of	4
the	4
trees,	4
why	4
should	4
he	4
who	4
would	4
have	4
me	4
preserve	4
it	4
among	4
men,	4
seek	4
to	4
rob	4
me	4
of	4
it?	4
I	4
have,	4
as	4
you	4
know,	4
wealth	4
of	4
my	4
own,	4
and	4
I	4
covet	4
not	4
that	4
of	4
others;	4
my	4
taste	4
is	4
for	4
freedom,	4
and	4
I	4
have	4
no	4
relish	4
for	4
constraint;	4
I	4
neither	4
love	4
nor	4
hate	4
anyone;	4
I	4
do	4
not	4
deceive	4
this	4
one	4
or	4
court	4
that,	4
or	4
trifle	4
with	4
one	4
or	4
play	4
with	4
another.	4
The	4
modest	4
converse	4
of	4
the	4
shepherd	4
girls	4
of	4
these	4
hamlets	4
and	4
the	4
care	4
of	4
my	4
goats	4
are	4
my	4
recreations;	4
my	4
desires	4
are	4
bounded	4
by	4
these	4
mountains,	4
and	4
if	4
they	4
ever	4
wander	4
hence	4
it	4
is	4
to	4
contemplate	4
the	4
beauty	4
of	4
the	4
heavens,	4
steps	4
by	4
which	4
the	4
soul	4
travels	4
to	4
its	4
primeval	4
abode.”	4
With	4
these	4
words,	4
and	4
not	4
waiting	4
to	4
hear	4
a	4
reply,	4
she	4
turned	4
and	4
passed	4
into	4
the	4
thickest	4
part	4
of	4
a	4
wood	4
that	4
was	4
hard	4
by,	4
leaving	4
all	4
who	4
were	4
there	4
lost	4
in	4
admiration	4
as	4
much	4
of	4
her	4
good	4
sense	4
as	4
of	4
her	4
beauty.	4
Some—those	4
wounded	4
by	4
the	4
irresistible	4
shafts	4
launched	4
by	4
her	4
bright	4
eyes—made	4
as	4
though	4
they	4
would	4
follow	4
her,	4
heedless	4
of	4
the	4
frank	4
declaration	4
they	4
had	4
heard;	4
seeing	4
which,	4
and	4
deeming	4
this	4
a	4
fitting	4
occasion	4
for	4
the	4
exercise	4
of	4
his	4
chivalry	4
in	4
aid	4
of	4
distressed	4
damsels,	4
Don	4
Quixote,	4
laying	4
his	4
hand	4
on	4
the	4
hilt	4
of	4
his	4
sword,	4
exclaimed	4
in	4
a	4
loud	4
and	4
distinct	4
voice:	4
“Let	4
no	4
one,	4
whatever	4
his	4
rank	4
or	4
condition,	4
dare	4
to	4
follow	4
the	4
beautiful	4
Marcela,	4
under	4
pain	4
of	4
incurring	4
my	4
fierce	4
indignation.	4
She	4
has	4
shown	4
by	4
clear	4
and	4
satisfactory	4
arguments	4
that	4
little	4
or	4
no	4
fault	4
is	4
to	4
be	4
found	4
with	4
her	4
for	4
the	4
death	4
of	4
Chrysostom,	4
and	4
also	4
how	4
far	4
she	4
is	4
from	4
yielding	4
to	4
the	4
wishes	4
of	4
any	4
of	4
her	4
lovers,	4
for	4
which	4
reason,	4
instead	4
of	4
being	4
followed	4
and	4
persecuted,	4
she	4
should	4
in	4
justice	4
be	4
honoured	4
and	4
esteemed	4
by	4
all	4
the	4
good	4
people	4
of	4
the	4
world,	4
for	4
she	4
shows	4
that	4
she	4
is	4
the	4
only	4
woman	4
in	4
it	4
that	4
holds	4
to	4
such	4
a	4
virtuous	4
resolution.”	4
Whether	4
it	4
was	4
because	4
of	4
the	4
threats	4
of	4
Don	4
Quixote,	4
or	4
because	4
Ambrosio	4
told	4
them	4
to	4
fulfil	4
their	4
duty	4
to	4
their	4
good	4
friend,	4
none	4
of	4
the	4
shepherds	4
moved	4
or	4
stirred	4
from	4
the	4
spot	4
until,	4
having	4
finished	4
the	4
grave	4
and	4
burned	4
Chrysostom’s	4
papers,	4
they	4
laid	4
his	4
body	4
in	4
it,	4
not	4
without	4
many	4
tears	4
from	4
those	4
who	4
stood	4
by.	4
They	4
closed	4
the	4
grave	4
with	4
a	4
heavy	4
stone	4
until	4
a	4
slab	4
was	4
ready	4
which	4
Ambrosio	4
said	4
he	4
meant	4
to	4
have	4
prepared,	4
with	4
an	4
epitaph	4
which	4
was	4
to	4
be	4
to	4
this	4
effect:	4
Beneath	4
the	4
stone	4
before	4
your	4
eyes	4
The	4
body	4
of	4
a	4
lover	4
lies;	4
In	4
life	4
he	4
was	4
a	4
shepherd	4
swain,	4
In	4
death	4
a	4
victim	4
to	4
disdain.	4
Ungrateful,	4
cruel,	4
coy,	4
and	4
fair,	4
Was	4
she	4
that	4
drove	4
him	4

despair,	4
And	4
Love	4
hath	4
made	4
her	4
his	4
ally	4
For	4
spreading	4

tyranny.	4
They	4
then	4
strewed	4
upon	4
the	4
grave	4
a	4
profusion	4
of	4
flowers	4
and	4
branches,	4
and	4
all	4
expressing	4
their	4
condolence	4
with	4
his	4
friend	4
Ambrosio,	4
took	4
their	4
leave.	4
Vivaldo	4
and	4
his	4
companion	4
did	4
the	4
same;	4
and	4
Don	4
Quixote	4
bade	4
farewell	4
to	4
his	4
hosts	4
and	4
to	4
the	4
travellers,	4
who	4
pressed	4
him	4
to	4
come	4
with	4
them	4
to	4
Seville,	4
as	4
being	4
such	4
a	4
convenient	4
place	4
for	4
finding	4
adventures,	4
for	4
they	4
presented	4
themselves	4
in	4
every	4
street	4
and	4
round	4
every	4
corner	4
oftener	4
than	4
anywhere	4
else.	4
Don	4
Quixote	4
thanked	4
them	4
for	4
their	4
advice	4
and	4
for	4
the	4
disposition	4
they	4
showed	4
to	4
do	4
him	4
a	4
favour,	4
and	4
said	4
that	4
for	4
the	4
present	4
he	4
would	4
not,	4
and	4
must	4
not	4
go	4
to	4
Seville	4
until	4
he	4
had	4
cleared	4
all	4
these	4
mountains	4
of	4
highwaymen	4
and	4
robbers,	4
of	4
whom	4
report	4
said	4
they	4
were	4
full.	4
Seeing	4
his	4
good	4
intention,	4
the	4
travellers	4
were	4
unwilling	4
to	4
press	4
him	4
further,	4
and	4
once	4
more	4
bidding	4
him	4
farewell,	4
they	4
left	4
him	4
and	4
pursued	4
their	4
journey,	4
in	4
the	4
course	4
of	4
which	4
they	4
did	4
not	4
fail	4
to	4
discuss	4
the	4
story	4
of	4
Marcela	4
and	4
Chrysostom	4
as	4
well	4
as	4
the	4
madness	4
of	4
Don	4
Quixote.	4
He,	4
on	4
his	4
part,	4
resolved	4
to	4
go	4
in	4
quest	4
of	4
the	4
shepherdess	4
Marcela,	4
and	4
make	4
offer	4
to	4
her	4
of	4
all	4
the	4
service	4
he	4
could	4
render	4
her;	4
but	4
things	4
did	4
not	4
fall	4
out	4
with	4
him	4
as	4
he	4
expected,	4
according	4
to	4
what	4
is	4
related	4

Chance,	4

and	4
the	4
devil,	4
who	4

so	4
ordained	4
it	4
that	4
feeding	4

was	4
a	4
drove	4
of	4

belonging	4
to	4
certain	4

carriers,	4
whose	4

to	4
take	4

where	4
Don	4
Quixote	4
chanced	4
to	4
be	4
suited	4
the	4
Yanguesans’	4
purpose	4
very	4
well.	4
It	4
so	4
happened,	4
then,	4
that	4
Rocinante	4
took	4
a	4
fancy	4
to	4
disport	4
himself	4
with	4
their	4
ladyships	4
the	4
ponies,	4
and	4
abandoning	4
his	4
usual	4
gait	4
and	4
demeanour	4
as	4
he	4
scented	4
them,	4
he,	4
without	4
asking	4
leave	4
of	4
his	4
master,	4
got	4
up	4
a	4
briskish	4
little	4
trot	4
and	4
hastened	4
to	4
make	4
known	4
his	4
wishes	4
to	4
them;	4
they,	4
however,	4
it	4
seemed,	4
preferred	4
their	4
pasture	4
to	4
him,	4
and	4
received	4
him	4
with	4
their	4
heels	4
and	4
teeth	4
to	4
such	4
effect	4
that	4
they	4
soon	4
broke	4
his	4
girths	4
and	4
left	4
him	4
naked	4
without	4
a	4
saddle	4
to	4
cover	4
him;	4
but	4
what	4
must	4
have	4
been	4
worse	4
to	4
him	4
was	4
that	4
the	4
carriers,	4
seeing	4
the	4
violence	4
he	4
was	4
offering	4
to	4
their	4
mares,	4
came	4
running	4
up	4
armed	4
with	4
stakes,	4
and	4
so	4
belaboured	4
him	4
that	4
they	4
brought	4
him	4
sorely	4
battered	4
to	4
the	4
ground.	4
By	4
this	4
time	4
Don	4
Quixote	4
and	4
Sancho,	4
who	4
had	4
witnessed	4
the	4
drubbing	4
of	4
Rocinante,	4
came	4
up	4
panting,	4
and	4
said	4
Don	4
Quixote	4
to	4
Sancho:	4
“So	4
far	4
as	4
I	4
can	4
see,	4
friend	4
Sancho,	4
these	4
are	4
not	4
knights	4
but	4
base	4
folk	4
of	4
low	4
birth:	4
I	4
mention	4
it	4
because	4
thou	4
canst	4
lawfully	4
aid	4
me	4
in	4
taking	4
due	4
vengeance	4
for	4
the	4
insult	4
offered	4
to	4
Rocinante	4
before	4
our	4
eyes.”	4
“What	4
the	4
devil	4
vengeance	4
can	4
we	4
take,”	4
answered	4
Sancho,	4
“if	4
they	4
are	4
more	4
than	4
twenty,	4
and	4
we	4
no	4
more	4
than	4
two,	4
or,	4
indeed,	4
perhaps	4
not	4
more	4
than	4
one	4
and	4
a	4
half?”	4
“I	4
count	4
for	4
a	4
hundred,”	4
replied	4
Don	4
Quixote,	4
and	4
without	4
more	4
words	4
he	4
drew	4
his	4
sword	4
and	4
attacked	4
the	4
Yanguesans	4
and	4
excited	4
and	4
impelled	4
by	4
the	4
example	4
of	4
his	4
master,	4
Sancho	4
did	4
the	4
same;	4
and	4
to	4
begin	4
with,	4
Don	4
Quixote	4
delivered	4
a	4
slash	4
at	4
one	4
of	4
them	4
that	4
laid	4
open	4
the	4
leather	4
jerkin	4
he	4
wore,	4
together	4
with	4
a	4
great	4
portion	4
of	4
his	4
shoulder.	4
The	4
Yanguesans,	4
seeing	4
themselves	4
assaulted	4
by	4
only	4
two	4
men	4
while	4
they	4
were	4
so	4
many,	4
betook	4
themselves	4
to	4
their	4
stakes,	4
and	4
driving	4
the	4
two	4
into	4
the	4
middle	4
they	4
began	4
to	4
lay	4
on	4
with	4
great	4
zeal	4
and	4
energy;	4
in	4
fact,	4
at	4
the	4
second	4
blow	4
they	4
brought	4
Sancho	4
to	4
the	4
ground,	4
and	4
Don	4
Quixote	4
fared	4
the	4
same	4
way,	4
all	4
his	4
skill	4
and	4
high	4
mettle	4
availing	4
him	4
nothing,	4
and	4
fate	4
willed	4
it	4
that	4
he	4
should	4
fall	4
at	4
the	4
feet	4
of	4
Rocinante,	4
who	4
had	4
not	4
yet	4
risen;	4
whereby	4
it	4
may	4
be	4
seen	4
how	4
furiously	4
stakes	4
can	4
pound	4

angry	4
boorish	4

Then,	4
seeing	4

mischief	4
they	4
had	4
done,	4
the	4
Yanguesans	4
with	4
all	4
the	4
haste	4

pursued	4
their	4

leaving	4
the	4
two	4
adventurers	4
a	4
sorry	4
sight	4

in	4
sorrier	4
mood.	4
Sancho	4
was	4
the	4
first	4
to	4
come	4
to,	4
and	4
finding	4
himself	4
close	4
to	4
his	4
master	4
he	4
called	4
to	4
him	4
in	4
a	4
weak	4
and	4
doleful	4
voice,	4
“Señor	4
Don	4
Quixote,	4
ah,	4
Señor	4
Don	4
Quixote!”	4
“What	4
wouldst	4
thou,	4
brother	4
Sancho?”	4
answered	4
Don	4
Quixote	4
in	4
the	4
same	4
feeble	4
suffering	4
tone	4
as	4
Sancho.	4
“I	4
would	4
like,	4
if	4
it	4
were	4
possible,”	4
answered	4
Sancho	4
Panza,	4
“your	4
worship	4
to	4
give	4
me	4
a	4
couple	4
of	4
sups	4
of	4
that	4
potion	4
of	4
the	4
fiery	4
Blas,	4
if	4
it	4
be	4
that	4
you	4
have	4
any	4
to	4
hand	4
there;	4
perhaps	4
it	4
will	4
serve	4
for	4
broken	4
bones	4
as	4
well	4
as	4
for	4
wounds.”	4
“If	4
I	4
only	4
had	4
it	4
here,	4
wretch	4
that	4
I	4
am,	4
what	4
more	4
should	4
we	4
want?”	4
said	4
Don	4
Quixote;	4
“but	4
I	4
swear	4
to	4
thee,	4
Sancho	4
Panza,	4
on	4
the	4
faith	4
of	4
a	4
knight-errant,	4
ere	4
two	4
days	4
are	4
over,	4
unless	4
fortune	4
orders	4
otherwise,	4
I	4
mean	4
to	4
have	4
it	4
in	4
my	4
possession,	4
or	4
my	4

“But	4
in	4

does	4
your	4

think	4
we	4
shall	4
have	4
the	4
use	4

answered	4
Sancho	4
Panza.	4
“For	4
myself	4
I	4
must	4
say	4
I	4
cannot	4
guess	4
how	4
many,”	4
said	4
the	4
battered	4
knight	4
Don	4
Quixote;	4
“but	4
I	4
take	4
all	4

who	4
where	4

I	4

that	4
in	4
punishment	4
for	4
having	4
transgressed	4
the	4
laws	4
of	4
chivalry	4
the	4
God	4
of	4

permitted	4
this	4
chastisement	4

for	4
which	4
reason,	4
brother	4
Sancho,	4
it	4
is	4
well	4
thou	4
shouldst	4
receive	4
a	4
hint	4
on	4
the	4
matter	4
which	4
I	4
am	4
now	4
about	4
to	4
mention	4
to	4
thee,	4
for	4
it	4
is	4
of	4
much	4
importance	4
to	4
the	4
welfare	4
of	4
both	4
of	4
us.	4
It	4
is	4
at	4
when	4
thou	4
shalt	4
see	4
rabble	4
of	4
this	4
sort	4
offering	4
us	4
insult	4
thou	4
art	4
not	4
to	4
wait	4
till	4
I	4
draw	4
sword	4
against	4
them,	4
for	4
I	4
shall	4
not	4
do	4
so	4
at	4
all;	4
but	4
do	4
thou	4
draw	4
sword	4
and	4
chastise	4
them	4
to	4
thy	4
heart’s	4
content,	4
and	4
if	4
any	4
knights	4
come	4
to	4
their	4
aid	4
and	4
defence	4
I	4
will	4
take	4
care	4
to	4
defend	4
thee	4
and	4
assail	4
them	4
with	4
all	4
my	4
might;	4
and	4
thou	4
hast	4
already	4
seen	4
by	4
a	4
thousand	4
signs	4
and	4
proofs	4
what	4
the	4
might	4
of	4
this	4
strong	4
arm	4
of	4
mine	4
is	4
equal	4
to”—so	4
uplifted	4
had	4
the	4
poor	4
gentleman	4
become	4
through	4
the	4
victory	4
over	4
the	4
stout	4
Biscayan.	4
But	4
Sancho	4
did	4
not	4
so	4
fully	4
approve	4
of	4
his	4
master’s	4
admonition	4
as	4
to	4
let	4
it	4
pass	4
without	4
saying	4
in	4
reply,	4
“Señor,	4
I	4
am	4
a	4
man	4
of	4
peace,	4
meek	4
and	4
quiet,	4
and	4
I	4
can	4
put	4
up	4
with	4
any	4
affront	4
because	4
I	4
have	4
a	4
wife	4
and	4
children	4
to	4
support	4
and	4
bring	4
up;	4
so	4
let	4
it	4
be	4
likewise	4
a	4
hint	4
to	4
your	4
worship,	4
as	4
it	4
cannot	4
be	4
a	4
mandate,	4
that	4
on	4
no	4
account	4
will	4
I	4
draw	4
sword	4
either	4
against	4
clown	4
or	4
against	4
knight,	4
and	4
that	4
here	4
before	4
God	4
I	4
forgive	4
the	4
insults	4
that	4
have	4
been	4
offered	4
me,	4
whether	4
they	4

whatsoever.”	4
To	4
all	4
which	4
his	4
master	4
said	4
in	4
reply,	4
“I	4
wish	4
I	4
had	4
breath	4
enough	4
to	4
speak	4
somewhat	4
easily,	4
and	4
that	4
the	4

would	4

as	4
to	4
let	4
me	4
explain	4
to	4
thee,	4
Panza,	4
the	4
mistake	4
thou	4
makest.	4
Come	4
now,	4
sinner,	4
suppose	4
the	4
wind	4
of	4
fortune,	4
hitherto	4
so	4
adverse,	4
should	4
turn	4
in	4
our	4
favour,	4
filling	4
the	4
sails	4
of	4
our	4
desires	4
so	4
that	4
safely	4
and	4
without	4
impediment	4
we	4
put	4
into	4
port	4
in	4
some	4
one	4
of	4
those	4
islands	4
I	4
have	4
promised	4
thee,	4
how	4
would	4
it	4
be	4
with	4
thee	4
if	4
on	4
winning	4
it	4
I	4
made	4
thee	4

Why,	4

to	4
be	4
one,	4
nor	4
possessing	4
the	4
courage	4
nor	4
the	4
will	4
to	4
avenge	4
insults	4
or	4
defend	4
thy	4
lordship;	4
for	4
thou	4
must	4
know	4
that	4
in	4
newly	4
conquered	4
kingdoms	4
and	4
provinces	4
the	4
minds	4
of	4
the	4
inhabitants	4
are	4
never	4
so	4
quiet	4
nor	4
so	4
well	4
disposed	4
to	4
the	4
new	4
lord	4
that	4
there	4
is	4
no	4
fear	4
of	4
their	4
making	4
some	4
move	4
to	4
change	4
matters	4
once	4
more,	4
and	4
try,	4
as	4
they	4
say,	4
what	4
chance	4
may	4
do	4
for	4
them;	4
so	4
it	4
is	4
essential	4
that	4
the	4
new	4
possessor	4
should	4
have	4
good	4
sense	4
to	4
enable	4
him	4
to	4
govern,	4
and	4
valour	4
to	4
attack	4
and	4
defend	4
himself,	4
whatever	4
may	4
befall	4
him.”	4
“In	4
what	4
has	4
now	4
befallen	4
us,”	4
answered	4
Sancho,	4
“I’d	4
have	4
been	4
well	4
pleased	4
to	4
have	4
that	4
good	4
sense	4
and	4
that	4
valour	4
your	4
worship	4
speaks	4
of,	4
but	4
I	4
swear	4
on	4
the	4
faith	4
of	4
a	4
poor	4
man	4
I	4
am	4
more	4
fit	4
for	4
plasters	4
than	4
for	4
arguments.	4
See	4
if	4
your	4
worship	4
can	4
get	4
up,	4
and	4
let	4
us	4
help	4
Rocinante,	4
though	4
he	4
does	4
not	4
deserve	4
it,	4
for	4
he	4
was	4
the	4
main	4
cause	4
of	4
all	4
this	4
thrashing.	4
I	4
never	4
thought	4
it	4
of	4
Rocinante,	4
for	4
I	4
took	4
him	4
to	4
be	4
a	4
virtuous	4
person	4
and	4
as	4
quiet	4
as	4
myself.	4
After	4
all,	4
they	4
say	4
right	4
that	4
it	4
takes	4
a	4
long	4
time	4
to	4
come	4
to	4
know	4
people,	4
and	4
that	4
there	4
is	4
nothing	4
sure	4
in	4
this	4
life.	4
Who	4
would	4
have	4
said	4
that,	4
after	4
such	4
mighty	4
slashes	4
as	4
your	4
worship	4
gave	4
that	4
unlucky	4
knight-errant,	4
there	4
was	4
coming,	4
travelling	4
post	4
and	4
at	4
the	4
very	4
heels	4
of	4
them,	4
such	4
a	4
great	4
storm	4
of	4
sticks	4
as	4
has	4
fallen	4
upon	4
our	4
shoulders?”	4
“And	4
yet	4
thine,	4
Sancho,”	4
replied	4
Don	4
Quixote,	4
“ought	4
to	4
be	4
used	4
to	4
such	4
squalls;	4
but	4
mine,	4
reared	4
in	4
soft	4
cloth	4
and	4
fine	4
linen,	4
it	4
is	4
plain	4
they	4
must	4
feel	4
more	4
keenly	4
the	4
pain	4
of	4
this	4
mishap,	4
and	4
if	4
it	4
were	4
not	4
that	4
I	4
imagine—why	4
do	4
I	4
say	4
imagine?—know	4
of	4
a	4
certainty	4
that	4
all	4
these	4
annoyances	4
are	4
very	4
necessary	4
accompaniments	4
of	4
the	4
calling	4
of	4
arms,	4
I	4
would	4
lay	4
me	4
down	4
here	4
to	4
die	4
of	4
pure	4
vexation.”	4
To	4
this	4
the	4
squire	4
replied,	4
“Señor,	4
as	4
these	4
mishaps	4
are	4
what	4
one	4
reaps	4
of	4
chivalry,	4
tell	4
me	4
if	4
they	4
happen	4
very	4
often,	4
or	4
if	4
they	4
have	4
their	4
own	4
fixed	4
times	4
for	4
coming	4
to	4
pass;	4
because	4
it	4
seems	4
to	4
me	4
that	4
after	4
two	4
harvests	4
we	4
shall	4
be	4
no	4
good	4
for	4
the	4
third,	4
unless	4
God	4
in	4
his	4
infinite	4
mercy	4
helps	4
us.”	4
“Know,	4
friend	4
Sancho,”	4
answered	4
Don	4
Quixote,	4
“that	4
the	4
life	4
of	4
knights-errant	4
is	4
subject	4
to	4
a	4
thousand	4
dangers	4
and	4
reverses,	4
and	4
neither	4
more	4
nor	4
less	4
is	4
it	4
within	4
immediate	4
possibility	4
for	4
knights-errant	4
to	4
become	4
kings	4
and	4
emperors,	4
as	4
experience	4
has	4
shown	4
in	4
the	4
case	4
of	4
many	4
different	4
knights	4
with	4
whose	4
histories	4
I	4
am	4
thoroughly	4
acquainted;	4
and	4
I	4
could	4
tell	4
thee	4
now,	4
if	4
the	4
pain	4
would	4
let	4
me,	4
of	4
some	4
who	4
simply	4
by	4
might	4
of	4
arm	4
have	4
risen	4
to	4
the	4
high	4
stations	4
I	4
have	4
mentioned;	4
and	4
those	4
same,	4
both	4
before	4
and	4
after,	4
experienced	4
divers	4
misfortunes	4
and	4
miseries;	4
for	4
the	4
valiant	4
Amadis	4
of	4
Gaul	4
found	4
himself	4
in	4
the	4
power	4
of	4
his	4
mortal	4
enemy	4
Arcalaus	4
the	4
magician,	4
who,	4
it	4
is	4
positively	4
asserted,	4
holding	4
him	4
captive,	4
gave	4
him	4
more	4
than	4
two	4
hundred	4
lashes	4
with	4
the	4
reins	4
of	4
his	4
horse	4
while	4
tied	4
to	4
one	4
of	4
the	4
pillars	4
of	4
a	4
court;	4
and	4
moreover	4
there	4
is	4
a	4
certain	4
recondite	4
author	4
of	4
no	4
small	4
authority	4
who	4
says	4
that	4
the	4
Knight	4
of	4
Phœbus,	4
being	4
caught	4
in	4
a	4
certain	4
pitfall,	4
which	4
opened	4
under	4
his	4
feet	4
in	4
a	4
certain	4
castle,	4
on	4
falling	4
found	4
himself	4
bound	4
hand	4
and	4
foot	4
in	4
a	4
deep	4
pit	4
underground,	4
where	4
they	4
administered	4
to	4
him	4
one	4
of	4
those	4
things	4
they	4
call	4
clysters,	4
of	4
sand	4
and	4
snow-water,	4
that	4
well-nigh	4
finished	4
him;	4
and	4
if	4
he	4
had	4
not	4
been	4
succoured	4
in	4
that	4
sore	4
extremity	4
by	4
a	4
sage,	4
a	4
great	4
friend	4
of	4
his,	4
it	4
would	4
have	4
gone	4
very	4
hard	4
with	4
the	4
poor	4
knight;	4
so	4
I	4
may	4
well	4
suffer	4
in	4
company	4
with	4
such	4
worthy	4
folk,	4
for	4
greater	4
were	4
the	4
indignities	4
which	4
they	4
had	4
to	4
suffer	4
than	4
those	4
which	4
we	4
suffer.	4
For	4
I	4
would	4
have	4
thee	4
know,	4
Sancho,	4
that	4
wounds	4
caused	4
by	4
any	4
instruments	4
which	4
happen	4
by	4
chance	4
to	4
be	4
in	4
hand	4
inflict	4
no	4
indignity,	4
and	4
this	4
is	4
laid	4
down	4
in	4
the	4
law	4
of	4
the	4
duel	4
in	4
express	4
words:	4
if,	4
for	4
instance,	4
the	4
cobbler	4
strikes	4
another	4
with	4
the	4
last	4
which	4
he	4
has	4
in	4
his	4
hand,	4
though	4
it	4
be	4
in	4
fact	4
a	4
piece	4
of	4
wood,	4
it	4
cannot	4
be	4
said	4
for	4
that	4
reason	4
that	4
he	4
whom	4
he	4
struck	4
with	4
it	4
has	4
been	4
cudgelled.	4
I	4
say	4
this	4
lest	4
thou	4
shouldst	4
imagine	4
that	4
because	4
we	4
have	4
been	4
drubbed	4
in	4
this	4
affray	4
we	4
have	4
therefore	4
suffered	4
any	4
indignity;	4
for	4
the	4
arms	4
those	4
men	4
carried,	4
with	4
which	4
they	4
pounded	4
us,	4
were	4
nothing	4
more	4
than	4
their	4
stakes,	4
and	4
not	4
one	4
of	4
them,	4
so	4
far	4
as	4
I	4
remember,	4
carried	4
rapier,	4
sword,	4
or	4
dagger.”	4
“They	4
gave	4
me	4
no	4
time	4
to	4
see	4
that	4
much,”	4
answered	4
Sancho,	4
“for	4
hardly	4
had	4
I	4
laid	4
hand	4
on	4
my	4
tizona	4
when	4
they	4
signed	4
the	4
cross	4
on	4
my	4
shoulders	4
with	4
their	4
sticks	4
in	4
such	4
style	4
that	4
they	4
took	4
the	4
sight	4
out	4
of	4
my	4
eyes	4
and	4
the	4
strength	4
out	4
of	4
my	4
feet,	4
stretching	4
me	4
where	4
I	4
now	4
lie,	4
and	4
where	4
thinking	4
of	4
whether	4
all	4
those	4
stake-strokes	4
were	4
an	4
indignity	4
or	4
not	4
gives	4
me	4
no	4
uneasiness,	4
which	4
the	4
pain	4
of	4
the	4
blows	4
does,	4
for	4
they	4
will	4
remain	4
as	4
deeply	4
impressed	4
on	4
my	4
memory	4
as	4
on	4
my	4
shoulders.”	4
“For	4
all	4
that	4
let	4
me	4
tell	4
thee,	4
brother	4
Panza,”	4
said	4
Don	4
Quixote,	4
“that	4
there	4
is	4
no	4
recollection	4
which	4
time	4
does	4
not	4
put	4
an	4
end	4
to,	4
and	4
no	4
pain	4
which	4
death	4
does	4
not	4
remove.”	4
“And	4
what	4
greater	4
misfortune	4
can	4
there	4
be,”	4
replied	4
Panza,	4
“than	4
the	4
one	4
that	4
waits	4
for	4
time	4
to	4
put	4
an	4
end	4
to	4
it	4
and	4
death	4
to	4
remove	4
it?	4
If	4
our	4
mishap	4
were	4
one	4
of	4
those	4
that	4
are	4
cured	4
with	4
a	4
couple	4
of	4
plasters,	4
it	4
would	4
not	4
be	4
so	4
bad;	4
but	4
I	4
am	4
beginning	4
to	4
think	4
that	4
all	4
the	4
plasters	4
in	4
a	4
hospital	4
almost	4
won’t	4
be	4
enough	4
to	4
put	4
us	4
right.”	4
“No	4
more	4
of	4
that:	4
pluck	4
strength	4
out	4
of	4
weakness,	4
Sancho,	4
as	4
I	4
mean	4
to	4
do,”	4
returned	4
Don	4
Quixote,	4
“and	4
let	4
us	4
see	4
how	4
Rocinante	4
is,	4
for	4
it	4
seems	4
to	4
me	4
that	4
not	4
the	4
least	4
share	4
of	4
this	4
mishap	4
has	4
fallen	4
to	4
the	4
lot	4
of	4
the	4
poor	4
beast.”	4
“There	4
is	4
nothing	4
wonderful	4
in	4
that,”	4
replied	4
Sancho,	4
“since	4
he	4
is	4
a	4
knight-errant	4
too;	4
what	4
I	4
wonder	4
at	4
is	4
that	4
my	4
beast	4
should	4
have	4
come	4
off	4
scot-free	4
where	4
we	4
come	4
out	4
scotched.”	4
“Fortune	4
always	4
leaves	4
a	4
door	4
open	4
in	4
adversity	4
in	4
order	4
to	4
bring	4
relief	4
to	4
it,”	4
said	4
Don	4
Quixote;	4
“I	4
say	4
so	4
because	4
this	4
little	4
beast	4
may	4
now	4
supply	4
the	4
want	4
of	4
Rocinante,	4
carrying	4
me	4
hence	4
to	4
some	4
castle	4
where	4
I	4
may	4
be	4
cured	4
of	4
my	4
wounds.	4
And	4
moreover	4
I	4
shall	4
not	4
hold	4
it	4
any	4
dishonour	4
to	4
be	4
so	4
mounted,	4
for	4
I	4
remember	4
having	4
read	4
how	4
the	4
good	4
old	4
Silenus,	4
the	4
tutor	4
and	4
instructor	4
of	4
the	4
gay	4
god	4
of	4
laughter,	4
when	4
he	4
entered	4
the	4
city	4
of	4
the	4
hundred	4
gates,	4
went	4
very	4
contentedly	4
mounted	4
on	4
a	4
handsome	4
ass.”	4
“It	4
may	4
be	4
true	4
that	4
he	4
went	4
mounted	4
as	4
your	4
worship	4
says,”	4
answered	4
Sancho,	4
“but	4
there	4
is	4
a	4
great	4
difference	4
between	4
going	4
mounted	4
and	4
going	4
slung	4
like	4
a	4
sack	4
of	4
manure.”	4
To	4
which	4
Don	4
Quixote	4
replied,	4
“Wounds	4
received	4
in	4
battle	4
confer	4
honour	4
instead	4
of	4
taking	4
it	4
away;	4
and	4
so,	4
friend	4
Panza,	4
say	4
no	4
more,	4
but,	4
as	4
I	4
told	4
thee	4
before,	4
get	4
up	4
as	4
well	4
as	4
thou	4
canst	4
and	4
put	4
me	4
on	4
top	4
of	4
thy	4
beast	4
in	4
whatever	4
fashion	4
pleases	4
thee	4
best,	4
and	4
let	4
us	4
go	4
hence	4
ere	4
night	4
come	4
on	4
and	4
surprise	4
us	4
in	4
these	4
wilds.”	4
“And	4
yet	4
I	4
have	4
heard	4
your	4
worship	4
say,”	4
observed	4
Panza,	4
“that	4
it	4
is	4
very	4
meet	4
for	4
knights-errant	4
to	4
sleep	4
in	4
wastes	4
and	4
deserts,	4
and	4
that	4
they	4
esteem	4
it	4
very	4
good	4
fortune.”	4
“That	4
is,”	4
said	4
Don	4
Quixote,	4
“when	4
they	4
cannot	4
help	4
it,	4
or	4
when	4
they	4
are	4
in	4
love;	4
and	4
so	4
true	4
is	4
this	4
that	4
there	4
have	4
been	4
knights	4
who	4
have	4
remained	4
two	4
years	4
on	4
rocks,	4
in	4
sunshine	4
and	4
shade	4
and	4
all	4
the	4
inclemencies	4
of	4
heaven,	4
without	4
their	4
ladies	4
knowing	4
anything	4
of	4
it;	4
and	4
one	4
of	4
these	4
was	4
Amadis,	4
when,	4
under	4
the	4
name	4
of	4
Beltenebros,	4
he	4
took	4
up	4
his	4
abode	4
on	4
the	4
Peña	4
Pobre	4
for—I	4
know	4
not	4
if	4
it	4
was	4
eight	4
years	4
or	4
eight	4
months,	4
for	4
I	4
am	4
not	4
very	4
sure	4
of	4
the	4
reckoning;	4
at	4
any	4
rate	4
he	4
stayed	4
there	4
doing	4
penance	4
for	4
I	4
know	4
not	4
what	4
pique	4
the	4
Princess	4
Oriana	4
had	4
against	4
him;	4
but	4
no	4
more	4
of	4
this	4
now,	4
Sancho,	4
and	4
make	4
haste	4
before	4
a	4
mishap	4
like	4
Rocinante’s	4
befalls	4
the	4
ass.”	4
“The	4
very	4
devil	4
would	4
be	4
in	4
it	4
in	4
that	4
case,”	4
said	4
Sancho;	4
and	4
letting	4
off	4
thirty	4
“ohs,”	4
and	4
sixty	4
sighs,	4
and	4
a	4
hundred	4
and	4
twenty	4
maledictions	4
and	4
execrations	4
on	4
whomsoever	4
it	4
was	4
that	4
had	4
brought	4
him	4
there,	4
he	4
raised	4
himself,	4
stopping	4
half-way	4
bent	4
like	4
a	4
Turkish	4
bow	4
without	4
power	4
to	4
bring	4
himself	4
upright,	4
but	4
with	4
all	4
his	4
pains	4
he	4
saddled	4
his	4
ass,	4
who	4
too	4
had	4
gone	4
astray	4
somewhat,	4
yielding	4
to	4
the	4
excessive	4
licence	4
of	4
the	4
day;	4
he	4
next	4
raised	4
up	4
Rocinante,	4
and	4
as	4
for	4
him,	4
had	4
he	4
possessed	4
a	4
tongue	4
to	4
complain	4
with,	4
most	4
assuredly	4
neither	4
Sancho	4
nor	4
his	4
master	4
would	4
have	4
been	4
behind	4
him.	4

as	4
chance	4
was	4
conducting	4
their	4
affairs	4
for	4
them	4
from	4
good	4
to	4
better,	4
he	4
had	4
not	4
gone	4
a	4
short	4
league	4
when	4
the	4
road	4
came	4
in	4
sight,	4
and	4
on	4
it	4
he	4
perceived	4
an	4
inn,	4
which	4
to	4
his	4
annoyance	4
and	4
to	4
the	4
delight	4
of	4
Don	4
Quixote	4
must	4
needs	4
be	4
a	4
castle.	4
Sancho	4
insisted	4
that	4
it	4
was	4
an	4
inn,	4
and	4
his	4
master	4
that	4
it	4
was	4
not	4
one,	4
but	4
a	4
castle,	4
and	4
the	4
dispute	4
lasted	4
so	4
long	4
that	4
before	4
the	4
point	4
was	4
settled	4
they	4
had	4
time	4
to	4
reach	4
it,	4
and	4
into	4
it	4
Sancho	4
entered	4
with	4
all	4
his	4
team	4
without	4
any	4
further	4
controversy.	4

The	4
innkeeper,	4
seeing	4
Don	4
Quixote	4
slung	4
across	4
the	4
ass,	4
asked	4
Sancho	4
what	4
was	4
amiss	4
with	4
him.	4
Sancho	4
answered	4
that	4
it	4
was	4
nothing,	4
only	4
that	4
he	4
had	4
fallen	4
down	4
from	4
a	4
rock	4
and	4
had	4
his	4
ribs	4
a	4
little	4
bruised.	4
The	4
innkeeper	4
had	4
a	4
wife	4
whose	4
disposition	4
was	4
not	4
such	4
as	4
those	4
of	4
her	4
calling	4
commonly	4
have,	4
for	4
she	4
was	4
by	4
nature	4
kind-hearted	4
and	4
felt	4
for	4
the	4
sufferings	4
of	4
her	4
neighbours,	4
so	4
she	4
at	4
once	4
set	4
about	4
tending	4
Don	4
Quixote,	4
and	4
made	4
her	4
young	4
daughter,	4
a	4
very	4
comely	4
girl,	4
help	4
her	4
in	4
taking	4
care	4
of	4
her	4
guest.	4
There	4
was	4
besides	4
in	4
the	4
inn,	4
as	4
servant,	4
an	4
Asturian	4
lass	4
with	4
a	4
broad	4
face,	4
flat	4
poll,	4
and	4
snub	4
nose,	4
blind	4
of	4
one	4
eye	4
and	4
not	4
very	4
sound	4
in	4
the	4
other.	4
The	4
elegance	4
of	4
her	4
shape,	4
to	4
be	4
sure,	4
made	4
up	4
for	4
all	4
her	4
defects;	4
she	4
did	4
not	4
measure	4
seven	4
palms	4
from	4
head	4
to	4
foot,	4
and	4
her	4
shoulders,	4
which	4
overweighted	4
her	4
somewhat,	4
made	4
her	4
contemplate	4
the	4
ground	4
more	4
than	4
she	4
liked.	4
This	4
graceful	4
lass,	4
then,	4
helped	4
the	4
young	4
girl,	4
and	4
the	4
two	4
made	4
up	4
a	4
very	4
bad	4
bed	4
for	4
Don	4
Quixote	4
in	4
a	4
garret	4
that	4
showed	4
evident	4
signs	4
of	4
having	4
formerly	4
served	4
for	4
many	4
years	4
as	4
a	4
straw-loft,	4
in	4
which	4
there	4
was	4
also	4
quartered	4
a	4
carrier	4
whose	4
bed	4
was	4
placed	4
a	4
little	4
beyond	4
our	4
Don	4
Quixote’s,	4
and,	4
though	4
only	4
made	4
of	4
the	4
pack-saddles	4
and	4
cloths	4
of	4
his	4
mules,	4
had	4
much	4
the	4
advantage	4
of	4
it,	4
as	4
Don	4
Quixote’s	4
consisted	4
simply	4
of	4
four	4
rough	4
boards	4
on	4
two	4
not	4
very	4
even	4
trestles,	4
a	4
mattress,	4
that	4
for	4
thinness	4
might	4
have	4
passed	4
for	4
a	4
quilt,	4
full	4
of	4
pellets	4
which,	4
were	4
they	4
not	4
seen	4
through	4
the	4
rents	4
to	4
be	4
wool,	4
would	4
to	4
the	4
touch	4
have	4
seemed	4
pebbles	4
in	4
hardness,	4
two	4
sheets	4
made	4
of	4
buckler	4
leather,	4
and	4
a	4
coverlet	4
the	4
threads	4
of	4
which	4
anyone	4
that	4
chose	4
might	4
have	4
counted	4
without	4
missing	4
one	4
in	4
the	4
reckoning.	4
On	4
this	4
accursed	4
bed	4
Don	4
Quixote	4
stretched	4
himself,	4
and	4
the	4
hostess	4
and	4
her	4
daughter	4
soon	4
covered	4
him	4
with	4
plasters	4
from	4
top	4
to	4
toe,	4
while	4
Maritornes—for	4
that	4
was	4
the	4
name	4
of	4
the	4
Asturian—held	4
the	4
light	4
for	4
them,	4
and	4
while	4
plastering	4
him,	4
the	4
hostess,	4
observing	4
how	4
full	4
of	4
wheals	4
Don	4
Quixote	4
was	4
in	4
some	4
places,	4
remarked	4
that	4
this	4
had	4
more	4
the	4
look	4
of	4
blows	4
than	4
of	4
a	4
fall.	4
It	4
was	4
not	4
blows,	4
Sancho	4
said,	4
but	4
that	4
the	4
rock	4
had	4
many	4
points	4
and	4
projections,	4
and	4
that	4
each	4
of	4
them	4
had	4
left	4
its	4
mark.	4
“Pray,	4
señora,”	4
he	4
added,	4
“manage	4
to	4
save	4
some	4
tow,	4
as	4
there	4
will	4
be	4
no	4
want	4
of	4
someone	4
to	4
use	4
it,	4
for	4
my	4
loins	4
too	4
are	4
rather	4
sore.”	4
“Then	4
you	4
must	4
have	4
fallen	4
too,”	4
said	4
the	4
hostess.	4
“I	4
did	4
not	4
fall,”	4
said	4
Sancho	4
Panza,	4
“but	4
from	4
the	4
shock	4
I	4
got	4
at	4
seeing	4
my	4
master	4
fall,	4
my	4
body	4
aches	4
so	4
that	4
I	4
feel	4
as	4
if	4
I	4
had	5
a	5
thousand	5
thwacks.”	5
“That	5
may	5
well	5
be,”	5
said	5
the	5
young	5
girl,	5
“for	5
it	5
has	5
many	5
a	5
time	5
happened	5
to	5
me	5
to	5
dream	5
that	5
I	5
was	5
falling	5
down	5
from	5
a	5
tower	5
and	5
never	5
coming	5
to	5
the	5
ground,	5
and	5
when	5
I	5
awoke	5
from	5
the	5
dream	5
to	5
find	5
myself	5
as	5
weak	5
and	5
shaken	5
as	5
if	5
I	5
had	5
really	5
fallen.”	5
“There	5
is	5
the	5
point,	5
señora,”	5
replied	5
Sancho	5
Panza,	5
“that	5
I	5
without	5
dreaming	5
at	5
all,	5
but	5
being	5
more	5
awake	5
than	5
I	5
am	5
now,	5
find	5
myself	5
with	5
scarcely	5
less	5
wheals	5
than	5
my	5
master,	5
Don	5
Quixote.”	5
“How	5
is	5
the	5
gentleman	5
called?”	5
asked	5
Maritornes	5
the	5
Asturian.	5
“Don	5
Quixote	5
of	5
La	5
Mancha,”	5
answered	5
Sancho	5
Panza,	5
“and	5
he	5
is	5
a	5
knight-adventurer,	5
and	5
one	5
of	5
the	5
best	5
and	5
stoutest	5
that	5
have	5
been	5
seen	5
in	5
the	5
world	5
this	5
long	5
time	5
past.”	5
“What	5
is	5
a	5
knight-adventurer?”	5
said	5
the	5
lass.	5
“Are	5
you	5
so	5
new	5
in	5
the	5
world	5
as	5
not	5
to	5
know?”	5
answered	5
Sancho	5
Panza.	5
“Well,	5
then,	5
you	5
must	5
know,	5
sister,	5
that	5
a	5
knight-adventurer	5
is	5
a	5
thing	5
that	5
in	5
two	5
words	5
is	5
seen	5
drubbed	5
and	5
emperor,	5
that	5
is	5
to-day	5
the	5
most	5
miserable	5
and	5
needy	5
being	5
in	5
the	5
world,	5
and	5
to-morrow	5
will	5
have	5
two	5
or	5
three	5
crowns	5
of	5
kingdoms	5
to	5
give	5
his	5
squire.”	5
“Then	5
how	5
is	5
it,”	5
said	5
the	5
hostess,	5
“that	5
belonging	5
to	5
so	5
good	5
a	5
master	5
as	5
this,	5
you	5
have	5
not,	5
to	5
judge	5
by	5
appearances,	5
even	5
so	5
much	5
as	5
a	5
county?”	5
“It	5
is	5
too	5
soon	5
yet,”	5
answered	5
Sancho,	5
“for	5
we	5
have	5
only	5
been	5
a	5
month	5
going	5
in	5
quest	5
of	5
adventures,	5
and	5
so	5
far	5
we	5
have	5
met	5
with	5
nothing	5
that	5
can	5
be	5
called	5
one,	5
for	5
it	5
will	5
happen	5
that	5
when	5
one	5
thing	5
is	5
looked	5
for	5
another	5
thing	5
is	5
found;	5
however,	5
if	5
my	5
master	5
Don	5
Quixote	5
gets	5
well	5
of	5
this	5
wound,	5
or	5
fall,	5
and	5
I	5
am	5
left	5
none	5
the	5
worse	5
of	5
it,	5
I	5
would	5
not	5
change	5
my	5
hopes	5
for	5
the	5
best	5
title	5
in	5
Spain.”	5
To	5
all	5
this	5
conversation	5
Don	5
Quixote	5
was	5
listening	5
very	5
attentively,	5
and	5
sitting	5
up	5
in	5
bed	5
as	5
well	5
as	5
he	5
could,	5
and	5
taking	5
the	5
hostess	5
by	5
the	5
hand	5
he	5
said	5
to	5
her,	5
“Believe	5
me,	5
fair	5
lady,	5
you	5
may	5
call	5
yourself	5
fortunate	5
in	5
having	5
in	5
this	5
castle	5
of	5
yours	5
sheltered	5
my	5
person,	5
which	5
is	5
such	5
that	5
if	5
I	5
do	5
not	5
myself	5
praise	5
it,	5
it	5
is	5
because	5
of	5
what	5
is	5
commonly	5
said,	5
that	5
self-praise	5
debaseth;	5
but	5
my	5
squire	5
will	5
inform	5
you	5
who	5
I	5
am.	5
I	5
only	5
tell	5
you	5
that	5
I	5
shall	5
preserve	5
for	5
ever	5
inscribed	5
on	5
my	5
memory	5
the	5
service	5
you	5
have	5
rendered	5
me	5
in	5
order	5
to	5
tender	5
you	5
my	5
gratitude	5
while	5
life	5
shall	5
last	5
me;	5
and	5
would	5
to	5
Heaven	5
love	5
held	5
me	5
not	5
so	5
enthralled	5
and	5
subject	5
to	5
its	5
laws	5
and	5
to	5
the	5
eyes	5
of	5
that	5
fair	5
ingrate	5
whom	5
I	5
name	5
between	5
my	5
teeth,	5
but	5
that	5
those	5
of	5
this	5
lovely	5
damsel	5
might	5
be	5
the	5
masters	5
of	5
my	5
liberty.”	5
The	5
hostess,	5
her	5
daughter,	5
and	5
the	5
worthy	5
Maritornes	5
listened	5
in	5
bewilderment	5
to	5
the	5
words	5
of	5
the	5
knight-errant;	5
for	5
they	5
understood	5
about	5
as	5
much	5
of	5
them	5
as	5
if	5
he	5
had	5
been	5
talking	5
Greek,	5
though	5
they	5
could	5
perceive	5
they	5
were	5
all	5
meant	5
for	5
expressions	5
of	5
good-will	5
and	5
blandishments;	5
and	5
not	5
being	5
accustomed	5
to	5
this	5
kind	5
of	5
language,	5
they	5
stared	5
at	5
him	5
and	5
wondered	5
to	5
themselves,	5
for	5
he	5
seemed	5
to	5
them	5
a	5
man	5
of	5
a	5
different	5
sort	5
from	5
those	5
they	5
were	5
used	5
to,	5
and	5
thanking	5
him	5
in	5
pothouse	5
phrase	5
for	5
his	5
civility	5
they	5
left	5
him,	5
while	5
the	5
Asturian	5
gave	5
her	5
attention	5
to	5
Sancho,	5
who	5
needed	5
it	5
no	5
less	5
than	5
his	5
master.	5
The	5
carrier	5
had	5
made	5
an	5
arrangement	5
with	5
her	5
for	5
recreation	5
that	5
night,	5
and	5
she	5
had	5
given	5
him	5
her	5
word	5
that	5
when	5
the	5
guests	5
were	5
quiet	5
and	5
the	5
family	5
asleep	5
she	5
would	5
come	5
in	5
search	5
of	5
him	5
and	5
meet	5
his	5
wishes	5
unreservedly.	5
And	5
it	5
is	5
said	5
of	5
this	5
good	5
lass	5
that	5
she	5
never	5
made	5
promises	5
of	5
the	5
kind	5
without	5
fulfilling	5
them,	5
even	5
though	5
she	5
made	5
them	5
in	5
a	5
forest	5
and	5
without	5
any	5
witness	5
present,	5
for	5
she	5
plumed	5
herself	5
greatly	5
on	5
being	5
a	5
lady	5
and	5
held	5
it	5
no	5
disgrace	5
to	5
be	5
in	5
such	5
an	5
employment	5
as	5
servant	5
in	5
an	5
inn,	5
because,	5
she	5
said,	5
misfortunes	5
and	5
ill-luck	5
had	5
brought	5
her	5
to	5
that	5
position.	5
The	5
hard,	5
narrow,	5
wretched,	5
rickety	5
bed	5
of	5
Don	5
Quixote	5
stood	5
first	5
in	5
the	5
middle	5
of	5
this	5
star-lit	5
stable,	5
and	5
close	5
beside	5
it	5
Sancho	5
made	5
his,	5
which	5
merely	5
consisted	5
of	5
a	5
rush	5
mat	5
and	5
a	5
blanket	5
that	5
looked	5
as	5
if	5
it	5
was	5
of	5
threadbare	5
canvas	5
rather	5
than	5
of	5
wool.	5
Next	5
to	5
these	5
two	5
beds	5
was	5
that	5
of	5
the	5
carrier,	5
made	5
up,	5
as	5
has	5
been	5
said,	5
of	5
the	5
pack-saddles	5
and	5
all	5
the	5
trappings	5
of	5
the	5
two	5
best	5
mules	5
he	5
had,	5
though	5
there	5
were	5
twelve	5
of	5
them,	5
sleek,	5
plump,	5
and	5
in	5
prime	5
condition,	5
for	5
he	5
was	5
one	5
of	5
the	5
rich	5
carriers	5
of	5
Arévalo,	5
according	5
to	5
the	5
author	5
of	5
this	5
history,	5
who	5
particularly	5
mentions	5
this	5
carrier	5
because	5
he	5
knew	5
him	5
very	5
well,	5
and	5
they	5
even	5
say	5
was	5
in	5
some	5
degree	5
a	5
relation	5
of	5
his;	5
besides	5
which	5
Cid	5
Hamete	5
Benengeli	5
was	5
a	5
historian	5
of	5
great	5
research	5
and	5
accuracy	5
in	5
all	5
things,	5
as	5
is	5
very	5
evident	5
since	5
he	5
would	5
not	5
pass	5
over	5
in	5
silence	5
those	5
that	5
have	5
been	5
already	5
mentioned,	5
however	5
trifling	5
and	5
insignificant	5
they	5
might	5
be,	5
an	5
example	5
that	5
might	5
be	5
followed	5
by	5
those	5
grave	5
historians	5
who	5
relate	5
transactions	5
so	5
curtly	5
and	5
briefly	5
that	5
we	5
hardly	5
get	5
a	5
taste	5
of	5
them,	5
all	5
the	5
substance	5
of	5
the	5
work	5
being	5
left	5
in	5
the	5
inkstand	5
from	5
carelessness,	5
perverseness,	5
or	5
ignorance.	5
A	5
thousand	5
blessings	5
on	5
the	5
author	5
of	5
“Tablante	5
de	5
Ricamonte”	5
and	5
that	5
of	5
the	5
other	5
book	5
in	5
which	5
the	5
deeds	5
of	5
the	5
Conde	5
Tomillas	5
are	5
recounted;	5
with	5
what	5
minuteness	5
they	5
describe	5
everything!	5
To	5
proceed,	5
then:	5
after	5
having	5
paid	5
a	5
visit	5
to	5
his	5
team	5
and	5
given	5
them	5
their	5
second	5
feed,	5
the	5
carrier	5
stretched	5
himself	5
on	5
his	5
pack-saddles	5
and	5
lay	5
waiting	5
for	5
his	5
conscientious	5
Maritornes.	5
Sancho	5
was	5
by	5
this	5
time	5
plastered	5
and	5
had	5
lain	5
down,	5
and	5
though	5
he	5
strove	5
to	5
sleep	5
the	5
pain	5
of	5

him,	5

Don	5
Quixote	5
with	5
the	5
pain	5
of	5
his	5
had	5

wide	5
open	5
as	5
a	5
hare’s.	5

The	5
inn	5
was	5
all	5
in	5
silence,	5
and	5
in	5
the	5
whole	5
of	5
it	5
there	5
was	5
no	5
light	5
except	5
that	5
given	5
by	5
a	5
lantern	5
that	5
hung	5
burning	5
in	5
the	5
middle	5
of	5
the	5
gateway.	5
This	5
strange	5
stillness,	5
and	5
the	5
thoughts,	5
always	5
present	5
to	5
our	5
knight’s	5
mind,	5
of	5
the	5
incidents	5
described	5
at	5
every	5
turn	5
in	5
the	5
books	5
that	5
were	5
the	5
cause	5
of	5
his	5
misfortune,	5
conjured	5
up	5
to	5
his	5
imagination	5
as	5
extraordinary	5
a	5
delusion	5
as	5
can	5
well	5
be	5
conceived,	5
which	5
was	5
that	5
he	5
fancied	5
himself	5
to	5
have	5
reached	5
a	5
famous	5
castle	5
(for,	5
as	5
has	5
been	5
said,	5
all	5
the	5
inns	5
he	5
lodged	5
in	5
were	5
castles	5
to	5
his	5
eyes),	5
and	5
that	5
the	5
daughter	5
of	5
the	5
innkeeper	5
was	5
daughter	5
of	5
the	5
lord	5
of	5
the	5
castle,	5
and	5
that	5
she,	5
won	5
by	5
his	5
high-bred	5
bearing,	5
had	5
fallen	5
in	5
love	5
with	5
him,	5
and	5
had	5
promised	5
to	5
come	5
to	5
his	5
bed	5
for	5
a	5
while	5
that	5
night	5
without	5
the	5
knowledge	5
of	5
her	5
parents;	5
and	5
holding	5
all	5
this	5
fantasy	5
that	5
he	5
had	5
constructed	5
as	5
solid	5
fact,	5
he	5
began	5
to	5
feel	5
uneasy	5
and	5
to	5
consider	5
the	5
perilous	5
risk	5
which	5
his	5
virtue	5
was	5
about	5
to	5
encounter,	5
and	5
he	5
resolved	5
in	5
his	5
heart	5
to	5
commit	5
no	5
treason	5
to	5
his	5
lady	5
Dulcinea	5
del	5
Toboso,	5
even	5
though	5
the	5
queen	5
Guinevere	5
herself	5
and	5
the	5
dame	5
Quintañona	5
should	5
present	5
themselves	5
before	5
him.	5
While	5
he	5
was	5
taken	5
up	5
with	5
these	5
vagaries,	5
then,	5
the	5
time	5
and	5
the	5
hour—an	5
unlucky	5
one	5
for	5
him—arrived	5
for	5
the	5
Asturian	5
to	5
come,	5
who	5
in	5
her	5
smock,	5
with	5
bare	5
feet	5
and	5
her	5
hair	5
gathered	5
into	5
a	5
fustian	5
coif,	5
with	5
noiseless	5
and	5
cautious	5
steps	5
entered	5
the	5
chamber	5
where	5
the	5
three	5
were	5
quartered,	5
in	5
quest	5
of	5
the	5
carrier;	5
but	5
scarcely	5
had	5
she	5
gained	5
the	5
door	5
when	5
Don	5
Quixote	5
perceived	5
her,	5
and	5
sitting	5
up	5
in	5
his	5
bed	5
in	5
spite	5
of	5
his	5
plasters	5
and	5
the	5
pain	5
of	5
his	5
ribs,	5
he	5
stretched	5
out	5
his	5
arms	5
to	5
receive	5
his	5
beauteous	5
damsel.	5
The	5
Asturian,	5
who	5
went	5
all	5
doubled	5
up	5
and	5
in	5
silence	5
with	5
her	5
hands	5
before	5
her	5
feeling	5
for	5
her	5
lover,	5
encountered	5
the	5
arms	5
of	5
Don	5
Quixote,	5
who	5
grasped	5
her	5
tightly	5
by	5
the	5
wrist,	5
and	5
drawing	5
her	5
towards	5
him,	5
while	5
she	5
dared	5
not	5
utter	5
a	5
word,	5
made	5
her	5
sit	5
down	5
on	5
the	5
bed.	5
He	5
then	5
felt	5
her	5
smock,	5
and	5
although	5
it	5
was	5
of	5
sackcloth	5
it	5
appeared	5
to	5
him	5
to	5
be	5
of	5
the	5
finest	5
and	5
softest	5
silk:	5
on	5
her	5
wrists	5
she	5
wore	5
some	5
glass	5
beads,	5
but	5
to	5
him	5
they	5
had	5
the	5
sheen	5
of	5
precious	5
Orient	5
pearls:	5
her	5
hair,	5
which	5
in	5
some	5
measure	5
resembled	5
a	5
horse’s	5
mane,	5
he	5
rated	5
as	5
threads	5
of	5
the	5
brightest	5
gold	5
of	5
Araby,	5
whose	5
refulgence	5
dimmed	5
the	5
sun	5
himself:	5
her	5
breath,	5
which	5
no	5
doubt	5
smelt	5
of	5
yesterday’s	5
stale	5
salad,	5
seemed	5
to	5
him	5
to	5
diffuse	5
a	5
sweet	5
aromatic	5
fragrance	5
from	5
her	5
mouth;	5
and,	5
in	5
short,	5
he	5
drew	5
her	5
portrait	5
in	5
his	5
imagination	5
with	5
the	5
same	5
features	5
and	5
in	5
the	5
same	5
style	5
as	5
that	5
which	5
he	5
had	5
seen	5
in	5
his	5
books	5
of	5
the	5
other	5
princesses	5
who,	5
smitten	5
by	5
love,	5
came	5
with	5
all	5
the	5
adornments	5
that	5
are	5
here	5
set	5
down,	5
to	5
see	5
the	5
sorely	5
wounded	5
knight;	5
and	5
so	5
great	5
was	5
the	5
poor	5
gentleman’s	5
blindness	5
that	5
neither	5
touch,	5
nor	5
smell,	5
nor	5
anything	5
else	5
about	5
the	5
good	5
lass	5
that	5
would	5
have	5
made	5
any	5
but	5
a	5
carrier	5
vomit,	5
were	5
enough	5
to	5
undeceive	5
him;	5
on	5
the	5
contrary,	5
he	5
was	5
persuaded	5
he	5
had	5
the	5
goddess	5
of	5
beauty	5
in	5
his	5
arms,	5
and	5
holding	5
her	5
firmly	5
in	5
his	5
grasp	5
he	5
went	5
on	5
to	5
say	5
in	5
low,	5
tender	5
voice:	5
“Would	5
that	5
found	5
myself,	5
lovely	5
and	5
exalted	5
lady,	5
in	5
a	5
position	5
to	5
repay	5
such	5
a	5
favour	5
as	5
that	5
which	5
you,	5
by	5
the	5
sight	5
of	5
your	5
great	5
beauty,	5
have	5
granted	5
me;	5
but	5
fortune,	5
which	5
is	5
never	5
weary	5
of	5
persecuting	5
the	5
good,	5
has	5
chosen	5
to	5
place	5
me	5
upon	5
this	5
bed,	5
where	5
I	5
lie	5
so	5
bruised	5
and	5
broken	5
that	5
though	5
my	5
inclination	5
would	5
gladly	5
comply	5
with	5
yours	5
it	5
is	5
impossible;	5
besides,	5
to	5
this	5
impossibility	5
another	5
yet	5
greater	5
is	5
to	5
be	5
added,	5
which	5
is	5
the	5
faith	5
that	5
I	5
have	5
pledged	5
to	5
the	5
peerless	5
Dulcinea	5
del	5
Toboso,	5
sole	5
lady	5
of	5
my	5
most	5
secret	5
thoughts;	5
and	5
were	5
it	5
not	5
that	5
this	5
stood	5
in	5
the	5
way	5
I	5
should	5
not	5
be	5
so	5
insensible	5
a	5
knight	5
as	5
to	5
miss	5
the	5
happy	5
opportunity	5
which	5
your	5
great	5
goodness	5
has	5
offered	5
me.”	5
Maritornes	5
was	5
fretting	5
and	5
sweating	5
at	5
finding	5
herself	5
held	5
so	5
fast	5
by	5
Don	5
Quixote,	5
and	5
not	5
understanding	5
or	5
heeding	5
the	5
words	5
he	5
addressed	5
to	5
her,	5
she	5
strove	5
without	5
speaking	5
to	5
free	5
herself.	5
The	5
worthy	5
carrier,	5
whose	5
unholy	5
thoughts	5
kept	5
him	5
awake,	5
was	5
aware	5
of	5
his	5
doxy	5
the	5
moment	5
she	5
entered	5
the	5
door,	5
and	5
was	5
listening	5
attentively	5
to	5
all	5
Don	5
Quixote	5
said;	5
and	5
jealous	5
that	5
the	5
Asturian	5
should	5
have	5
broken	5
her	5
word	5
with	5
him	5
for	5
another,	5
drew	5
nearer	5
to	5
Don	5
Quixote’s	5
bed	5
and	5
stood	5
still	5
to	5
see	5
what	5
would	5
come	5
of	5
this	5
talk	5
which	5
he	5
could	5
not	5
understand;	5
but	5
when	5
he	5
perceived	5
the	5
wench	5
struggling	5
to	5
get	5
free	5
and	5
Don	5
Quixote	5
striving	5
to	5
hold	5
her,	5
not	5
relishing	5
the	5
joke	5
he	5
raised	5
his	5
arm	5
and	5
delivered	5
such	5
a	5
terrible	5
cuff	5
on	5
the	5
lank	5
jaws	5
of	5
the	5
amorous	5
knight	5
that	5
he	5
bathed	5
all	5
his	5
mouth	5
in	5
blood,	5
and	5
not	5
content	5
with	5
this	5
he	5
mounted	5
on	5
his	5
ribs	5
and	5
with	5
his	5
feet	5
tramped	5
all	5
over	5
them	5
at	5
a	5
pace	5
rather	5
smarter	5
than	5
a	5
trot.	5
The	5
bed	5
which	5
was	5
somewhat	5
crazy	5
and	5
not	5
very	5
firm	5
on	5
its	5
feet,	5
unable	5
to	5
support	5
the	5
additional	5
weight	5
of	5
the	5
carrier,	5
came	5
to	5
the	5
ground,	5
and	5
at	5
the	5
mighty	5
crash	5
of	5
this	5
the	5
innkeeper	5
awoke	5
and	5
at	5
once	5
concluded	5
that	5
it	5
must	5
be	5
some	5
brawl	5
of	5
Maritornes’,	5
because	5
after	5
calling	5
loudly	5
to	5
her	5
he	5
got	5
no	5
answer.	5
With	5
this	5
suspicion	5
he	5
got	5
up,	5
and	5
lighting	5
a	5
lamp	5
hastened	5
to	5
the	5
quarter	5
where	5
he	5
had	5
heard	5
the	5
disturbance.	5
The	5
wench,	5
seeing	5
that	5
her	5
master	5
was	5
coming	5
and	5
knowing	5
that	5
his	5
temper	5
was	5
terrible,	5
frightened	5
and	5
panic-stricken	5
made	5
for	5
the	5
bed	5
of	5
Sancho	5
Panza,	5
who	5
still	5
slept,	5
and	5
crouching	5
upon	5
it	5
made	5
a	5
ball	5
of	5
herself.	5
The	5
innkeeper	5
came	5
in	5
exclaiming,	5
“Where	5
art	5
thou,	5
strumpet?	5
Of	5
course	5
this	5
is	5
some	5
of	5
thy	5
work.”	5
At	5
this	5
Sancho	5
awoke,	5
and	5
feeling	5
this	5
mass	5
almost	5
on	5
top	5
of	5
him	5
fancied	5
he	5
had	5
the	5
nightmare	5
and	5
began	5
to	5
distribute	5
fisticuffs	5
all	5
round,	5
of	5
which	5
a	5
certain	5
share	5
fell	5
upon	5
Maritornes,	5
who,	5
irritated	5
by	5
the	5
pain	5
and	5
flinging	5
modesty	5
aside,	5
paid	5
back	5
so	5
many	5
in	5
return	5
to	5
Sancho	5
that	5
she	5
woke	5
him	5
up	5
in	5
spite	5
of	5
himself.	5
He	5
then,	5
finding	5
himself	5
so	5
handled,	5
by	5
whom	5
he	5
knew	5
not,	5
raising	5
himself	5
up	5
as	5
well	5
as	5
he	5
could,	5
grappled	5
with	5
Maritornes,	5
and	5
he	5
and	5
she	5
between	5
them	5
began	5
the	5
bitterest	5
and	5
drollest	5
scrimmage	5
in	5
the	5
world.	5
The	5
carrier,	5
however,	5
perceiving	5
by	5
the	5
light	5
of	5
the	5
innkeeper	5
candle	5
how	5
it	5
fared	5
with	5
his	5
ladylove,	5
quitting	5
Don	5
Quixote,	5
ran	5
to	5
bring	5
her	5
the	5
help	5
she	5
needed;	5
and	5
the	5
innkeeper	5
did	5
the	5
same	5
but	5
with	5
a	5
different	5
intention,	5
for	5
his	5
was	5
to	5
chastise	5
the	5
lass,	5
as	5
he	5
believed	5
that	5
beyond	5
a	5
doubt	5
she	5
alone	5
was	5
the	5
cause	5
of	5
all	5
the	5
harmony.	5
And	5
so,	5
as	5
the	5
saying	5
is,	5
cat	5
to	5
rat,	5
rat	5
to	5
rope,	5
rope	5
to	5
stick,	5
the	5
carrier	5
pounded	5
Sancho,	5
Sancho	5
the	5
lass,	5
she	5
him,	5
and	5
the	5
innkeeper	5
her,	5
and	5
all	5
worked	5
away	5
so	5
briskly	5
that	5
they	5
did	5
not	5
give	5
themselves	5
a	5
moment’s	5
rest;	5
and	5
the	5
best	5
of	5
it	5
was	5
that	5
the	5
innkeeper’s	5
lamp	5
went	5
out,	5
and	5
as	5
they	5
were	5
left	5
in	5
the	5
dark	5
they	5
all	5
laid	5
on	5
one	5
upon	5
the	5
other	5
in	5
a	5
mass	5
so	5
unmercifully	5
that	5
there	5
was	5
not	5
a	5
sound	5
spot	5
left	5
where	5
a	5
hand	5
could	5
light.	5
It	5
so	5
happened	5
that	5
there	5
was	5
lodging	5
that	5
night	5
in	5
the	5
inn	5
a	5
caudrillero	5
of	5
what	5
they	5
call	5
the	5
Old	5
Holy	5
Brotherhood	5
of	5
Toledo,	5
who,	5
also	5
hearing	5
the	5
extraordinary	5
noise	5
of	5
the	5
conflict,	5
seized	5
his	5
staff	5
and	5
the	5
tin	5
case	5
with	5
his	5
warrants,	5
and	5
made	5
his	5
way	5
in	5
the	5
dark	5
into	5
the	5
room	5
crying:	5
“Hold!	5
in	5
the	5
name	5
of	5
the	5
Jurisdiction!	5
Hold!	5
in	5
the	5
name	5
of	5
the	5
Holy	5
Brotherhood!”	5
The	5
first	5
that	5
he	5
came	5
upon	5
was	5
the	5
pummelled	5
Don	5
Quixote,	5
who	5
lay	5
stretched	5
senseless	5
on	5
his	5
back	5
upon	5
his	5
broken-down	5
bed,	5
and,	5
his	5
hand	5
falling	5
on	5
the	5
beard	5
as	5
he	5
felt	5
about,	5
he	5
continued	5
to	5
cry,	5
“Help	5
for	5
the	5
Jurisdiction!”	5
but	5
perceiving	5
that	5
he	5
whom	5
he	5
had	5
laid	5
hold	5
of	5
did	5
not	5
move	5
or	5
stir,	5
he	5
concluded	5
that	5
he	5
was	5
dead	5
and	5
that	5
those	5
in	5
the	5
room	5
were	5
his	5
murderers,	5
and	5
with	5
this	5
suspicion	5
he	5
raised	5
his	5
voice	5
still	5
higher,	5
calling	5
out,	5
“Shut	5
the	5
inn	5
gate;	5
see	5
that	5
no	5
one	5
goes	5
out;	5
they	5
have	5
killed	5
a	5
man	5
here!”	5
This	5
cry	5
startled	5
them	5
all,	5
and	5
each	5
dropped	5
the	5
contest	5
at	5
the	5
point	5
at	5
which	5
the	5
voice	5
reached	5
him.	5
The	5
innkeeper	5
retreated	5
to	5
his	5
room,	5
the	5
carrier	5
to	5
his	5
pack-saddles,	5
the	5
lass	5
to	5
her	5
crib;	5
the	5
unlucky	5
Don	5
Quixote	5
and	5
Sancho	5
alone	5
were	5
unable	5
to	5
move	5
from	5
where	5
they	5
were.	5
The	5
cuadrillero	5
on	5
this	5
let	5
go	5
Don	5
Quixote’s	5
beard,	5
and	5
went	5
out	5
to	5
look	5
for	5
a	5
light	5
to	5
search	5
for	5
and	5
apprehend	5
the	5
culprits;	5
but	5
not	5
finding	5
one,	5
as	5
the	5
innkeeper	5
had	5
purposely	5
extinguished	5
the	5
lantern	5
on	5
retreating	5
to	5
his	5
room,	5
he	5
was	5
compelled	5
to	5
have	5
recourse	5
to	5
the	5
hearth,	5
where	5
after	5
much	5
time	5
and	5
trouble	5
he	5
lit	5
another	5
lamp.	5

By	5
this	5
time	5
Don	5
Quixote	5
had	5
recovered	5
from	5
his	5
swoon;	5
and	5
in	5
the	5
same	5
tone	5
of	5
voice	5
in	5
which	5
he	5
had	5
called	5
to	5
his	5
squire	5
the	5
day	5
before	5
when	5
he	5
lay	5
stretched	5
“in	5
the	5
vale	5
of	5
the	5
stakes,”	5
he	5
began	5
calling	5
to	5
him	5
now,	5
“Sancho,	5
my	5
friend,	5
art	5
thou	5
asleep?	5
sleepest	5
thou,	5
friend	5
Sancho?”	5
“How	5
can	5
I	5
sleep,	5
curses	5
on	5
it!”	5
returned	5
Sancho	5
discontentedly	5
and	5
bitterly,	5
“when	5
it	5
is	5
plain	5
that	5
all	5
the	5
devils	5
have	5
been	5
at	5
me	5
this	5
night?”	5
“Thou	5
mayest	5
well	5
believe	5
that,”	5
answered	5
Don	5
Quixote,	5
“because,	5
either	5
I	5
know	5
little,	5
or	5
this	5
castle	5
is	5
enchanted,	5
for	5
thou	5
must	5
know—but	5
this	5
that	5
I	5
am	5
now	5
about	5
to	5
tell	5
thee	5
thou	5
must	5
swear	5
to	5
keep	5
secret	5
until	5
after	5
my	5
death.”	5
“I	5
swear	5
it,”	5
answered	5
Sancho.	5
“I	5
say	5
so,”	5
continued	5
Don	5
Quixote,	5
“because	5
I	5
hate	5
taking	5
away	5
anyone’s	5
good	5
name.”	5
“I	5
say,”	5
replied	5
Sancho,	5
“that	5
I	5
swear	5
to	5
hold	5
my	5
tongue	5
about	5
it	5
till	5
the	5
end	5
of	5
your	5
worship’s	5
days,	5
and	5
God	5
grant	5
I	5
may	5
be	5
able	5
to	5
let	5
it	5
out	5
to-morrow.”	5
“Do	5
I	5
do	5
thee	5
such	5
injuries,	5
Sancho,”	5
said	5
Don	5
Quixote,	5
“that	5
thou	5
wouldst	5
see	5
me	5
dead	5
so	5
soon?”	5
“It	5
is	5
not	5
for	5
that,”	5
replied	5
Sancho,	5
“but	5
because	5
I	5
hate	5
keeping	5
things	5
long,	5
and	5
I	5
don’t	5
want	5
them	5
to	5
grow	5
rotten	5
with	5
me	5
from	5
over-keeping.”	5
“At	5
any	5
rate,”	5
said	5
Don	5
Quixote,	5
“I	5
have	5
more	5
confidence	5
in	5
thy	5
affection	5
and	5
good	5
nature;	5
and	5
so	5
I	5
would	5
have	5
thee	5
know	5
that	5
this	5
night	5
there	5
befell	5
me	5
one	5
of	5
the	5
strangest	5
adventures	5
that	5
I	5
could	5
describe,	5
and	5
to	5
relate	5
it	5
to	5
thee	5
briefly	5
thou	5
must	5
know	5
that	5
a	5
little	5
while	5
ago	5
the	5
daughter	5
of	5
the	5
lord	5
of	5
this	5
castle	5
came	5
to	5
me,	5
and	5
that	5
she	5
is	5
the	5
most	5
elegant	5
and	5
beautiful	5
damsel	5
that	5
could	5
be	5
found	5
in	5
the	5
wide	5
world.	5
What	5
I	5
could	5
tell	5
thee	5
of	5
the	5
charms	5
of	5
her	5
person!	5
of	5
her	5
lively	5
wit!	5
of	5
other	5
secret	5
matters	5
which,	5
to	5
preserve	5
the	5
fealty	5
I	5
owe	5
to	5
my	5
lady	5
Dulcinea	5
del	5
Toboso,	5
I	5
shall	5
pass	5
over	5
unnoticed	5
and	5
in	5
silence!	5
I	5
will	5
only	5
tell	5
thee	5
that,	5
either	5
fate	5
being	5
envious	5
of	5
so	5
great	5
a	5
boon	5
placed	5
in	5
my	5
hands	5
by	5
good	5
fortune,	5
or	5
perhaps	5
(and	5
this	5
is	5
more	5
probable)	5
this	5
castle	5
being,	5
as	5
I	5
have	5
already	5
said,	5
enchanted,	5
at	5
the	5
time	5
when	5
I	5
was	5
engaged	5
in	5
the	5
sweetest	5
and	5
most	5
amorous	5
discourse	5
with	5
her,	5
there	5
came,	5
without	5
my	5
seeing	5
or	5
knowing	5
whence	5
it	5
came,	5
a	5
hand	5
attached	5
to	5
some	5
arm	5
of	5
some	5
huge	5
giant,	5
that	5
planted	5
such	5
a	5
cuff	5
on	5
my	5
jaws	5
that	5
I	5
have	5
them	5
all	5
bathed	5
in	5
blood,	5
and	5
then	5
pummelled	5
me	5
in	5
such	5
a	5
way	5
that	5
I	5
am	5
in	5
a	5
worse	5
plight	5
than	5
yesterday	5
when	5
the	5
carriers,	5
on	5
account	5
of	5
Rocinante’s	5
misbehaviour,	5
inflicted	5
on	5
us	5
the	5
injury	5
thou	5
knowest	5
of;	5
whence	5
conjecture	5
that	5
there	5
must	5
be	5
some	5
enchanted	5
Moor	5
guarding	5
the	5
treasure	5
of	5
this	5
damsel’s	5
beauty,	5
and	5
that	5
it	5
is	5
not	5
for	5
me.”	5
“Not	5
for	5
me	5
either,”	5
said	5
Sancho,	5
“for	5
more	5
than	5
four	5
hundred	5
Moors	5
have	5
so	5
thrashed	5
me	5
that	5
the	5
drubbing	5
of	5
the	5
stakes	5
was	5
cakes	5
and	5
fancy-bread	5
to	5
it.	5
But	5
tell	5
me,	5
señor,	5
what	5
do	5
you	5
call	5
this	5
excellent	5
and	5
rare	5
adventure	5
that	5
has	5
left	5
us	5
as	5
we	5
are	5
left	5
now?	5
Though	5
your	5
worship	5
was	5
not	5
so	5
badly	5
off,	5
having	5
in	5
your	5
arms	5
that	5
incomparable	5
beauty	5
you	5
spoke	5
of;	5
but	5
I,	5
what	5
did	5
I	5
have,	5
except	5
the	5
heaviest	5
whacks	5
I	5
think	5
I	5
had	5
in	5
all	5
my	5
life?	5
Unlucky	5
me	5
and	5
the	5
mother	5
that	5
bore	5
me!	5
for	5
I	5
am	5
not	5
a	5
knight-errant	5
and	5
never	5
expect	5
to	5
be	5
one,	5
and	5
of	5
all	5
the	5
mishaps,	5
the	5
greater	5
part	5
falls	5
to	5
my	5
share.”	5
“Then	5
thou	5
hast	5
been	5
thrashed	5
too?”	5
said	5
Don	5
Quixote.	5
“Didn’t	5
I	5
say	5
so?	5
worse	5
luck	5
to	5
my	5
line!”	5
said	5
Sancho.	5
“Be	5
not	5
distressed,	5
friend,”	5
said	5
Don	5
Quixote,	5
“for	5
I	5
will	5
now	5
make	5
the	5
precious	5
balsam	5
with	5
which	5
we	5
shall	5
cure	5
ourselves	5
in	5
the	5
twinkling	5
of	5
an	5
eye.”	5
By	5
this	5
time	5
the	5
cuadrillero	5
had	5
succeeded	5
in	5
lighting	5
the	5
lamp,	5
and	5
came	5
in	5
to	5
see	5
the	5
man	5
that	5
he	5
thought	5
had	5
been	5
killed;	5
and	5
as	5
Sancho	5
caught	5
sight	5
of	5
him	5
at	5
the	5
door,	5
seeing	5
him	5
coming	5
in	5
his	5
shirt,	5
with	5
a	5
cloth	5
on	5
his	5
head,	5
and	5
a	5
lamp	5
in	5
his	5
hand,	5
and	5
a	5
very	5
forbidding	5
countenance,	5
he	5
said	5
to	5
his	5
master,	5
“Señor,	5
can	5
it	5
be	5
that	5
this	5
is	5
the	5
enchanted	5
Moor	5
coming	5
back	5
to	5
give	5
us	5
more	5
castigation	5
if	5
there	5
be	5
anything	5
still	5
left	5
in	5
the	5
ink-bottle?”	5
“It	5
cannot	5
be	5
the	5
Moor,”	5
answered	5
Don	5
Quixote,	5
“for	5
those	5
under	5
enchantment	5
do	5
not	5
let	5
themselves	5
be	5
seen	5
by	5
anyone.”	5
“If	5
they	5
don’t	5
let	5
themselves	5
be	5
seen,	5
they	5
let	5
themselves	5
be	5
felt,”	5
said	5
Sancho;	5
“if	5
not,	5
let	5
my	5
shoulders	5
speak	5
to	5
the	5
point.”	5
“Mine	5
could	5
speak	5
too,”	5
said	5
Don	5
Quixote,	5
“but	5
that	5
is	5
not	5
a	5
sufficient	5
reason	5
for	5
believing	5
that	5
what	5
we	5
see	5
is	5
the	5
enchanted	5
Moor.”	5
The	5
officer	5
came	5
up,	5
and	5
finding	5
them	5
engaged	5
in	5
such	5
a	5
peaceful	5
conversation,	5
stood	5
amazed;	5
though	5
Don	5
Quixote,	5
to	5
be	5
sure,	5
still	5
lay	5
on	5
his	5
back	5
unable	5
to	5
move	5
from	5
pure	5
pummelling	5
and	5
plasters.	5
The	5
officer	5
turned	5
to	5
him	5
and	5
said,	5
“Well,	5
how	5
goes	5
it,	5
good	5
man?”	5
“I	5
would	5
speak	5
more	5
politely	5
if	5
I	5
were	5
you,”	5
replied	5
Don	5
Quixote;	5
“is	5
it	5
the	5
way	5
of	5
this	5
country	5
to	5
address	5
knights-errant	5
in	5
that	5
style,	5
you	5
booby?”	5
The	5
cuadrillero	5
finding	5
himself	5
so	5
disrespectfully	5
treated	5
by	5
such	5
a	5
sorry-looking	5
individual,	5
lost	5
his	5
temper,	5
and	5
raising	5
the	5
lamp	5
full	5
of	5
oil,	5
smote	5
Don	5
Quixote	5
such	5
a	5
blow	5
with	5
it	5
on	5
the	5
head	5
that	5
he	5
gave	5
him	5
a	5
badly	5
broken	5
pate;	5
then,	5
all	5
being	5
in	5
darkness,	5
he	5
went	5
out,	5
and	5
Sancho	5
Panza	5
said,	5
“That	5
is	5
certainly	5
the	5
enchanted	5
Moor,	5
Señor,	5
and	5
he	5
keeps	5
the	5
treasure	5
for	5
others,	5
and	5
for	5
us	5
only	5
the	5
cuffs	5
and	5
lamp-whacks.”	5
“That	5
is	5
the	5
truth,”	5
answered	5
Don	5
Quixote,	5
“and	5
there	5
is	5
no	5
use	5
in	5
troubling	5
oneself	5
about	5
these	5
matters	5
of	5
enchantment	5
or	5
being	5
angry	5
or	5
vexed	5
at	5
them,	5
for	5
as	5
they	5
are	5
invisible	5
and	5
visionary	5
we	5
shall	5
find	5
no	5
one	5
on	5
whom	5
to	5
avenge	5
ourselves,	5
do	5
what	5
we	5
may;	5
rise,	5
Sancho,	5
if	5
thou	5
canst,	5
and	5
call	5
the	5
alcaide	5
of	5
this	5
fortress,	5
and	5
get	5
him	5
to	5
give	5
me	5
a	5
little	5
oil,	5
wine,	5
salt,	5
and	5
rosemary	5
to	5
make	5
the	5
salutiferous	5
balsam,	5
for	5
indeed	5
I	5
believe	5
I	5
have	5
great	5
need	5
of	5
it	5
now,	5
because	5
I	5
am	5
losing	5
much	5
blood	5
from	5
the	5
wound	5
that	5
phantom	5
gave	5
me.”	5
Sancho	5
got	5
up	5
with	5
pain	5
enough	5
in	5
his	5
bones,	5
and	5
went	5
after	5
the	5
innkeeper	5
in	5
the	5
dark,	5
and	5
meeting	5
the	5
officer,	5
who	5
was	5
looking	5
to	5
see	5
what	5
had	5
become	5
of	5
his	5
enemy,	5
he	5
said	5
to	5
him,	5
“Señor,	5
whoever	5
you	5
are,	5
do	5
us	5
the	5
favour	5
and	5
kindness	5
to	5
give	5
us	5
a	5
little	5
rosemary,	5
oil,	5
salt,	5
and	5
wine,	5
for	5
it	5
is	5
wanted	5
to	5
cure	5
one	5
of	5
the	5
best	5
knights-errant	5
on	5
earth,	5
who	5
lies	5
on	5
yonder	5
bed	5
wounded	5
by	5
the	5
hands	5
of	5
the	5
enchanted	5
Moor	5
that	5
is	5
in	5
this	5
inn.”	5
When	5
the	5
officer	5
heard	5
him	5
talk	5
in	5
this	5
way,	5
he	5
took	5
him	5
for	5
a	5
man	5
out	5
of	5
his	5
senses,	5
and	5
as	5
day	5
was	5
now	5
beginning	5
to	5
break,	5
he	5
opened	5
the	5
inn	5
gate,	5
and	5
calling	5
the	5
host,	5
he	5
told	5
him	5
what	5
this	5
good	5
man	5
wanted.	5
The	5
host	5
furnished	5
him	5
with	5
what	5
he	5
required,	5
and	5
Sancho	5
brought	5
it	5
to	5
Don	5
Quixote,	5
who,	5
with	5
his	5
hand	5
to	5
his	5
head,	5
was	5
bewailing	5
the	5
pain	5
of	5
the	5
blow	5
of	5
the	5
lamp,	5
which	5
had	5
done	5
him	5
no	5
more	5
harm	5
than	5
raising	5
a	5
couple	5
of	5
rather	5
large	5
lumps,	5
and	5
what	5
he	5
fancied	5
blood	5
was	5
only	5
the	5
sweat	5
that	5
flowed	5
from	5
him	5
in	5
his	5
sufferings	5
during	5
the	5
late	5
storm.	5
To	5
be	5
brief,	5
he	5
took	5
the	5
materials,	5
of	5
which	5
he	5
made	5
a	5
compound,	5
mixing	5
them	5
all	5
and	5
boiling	5
them	5
a	5
good	5
while	5
until	5
it	5
seemed	5
to	5
him	5
they	5
had	5
come	5
to	5
perfection.	5
He	5
then	5
asked	5
for	5
some	5
vial	5
to	5
pour	5
it	5
into,	5
and	5
as	5
there	5
was	5
not	5
one	5
in	5
the	5
inn,	5
he	5
decided	5
on	5
putting	5
it	5
into	5
a	5
tin	5
oil-bottle	5
or	5
flask	5
of	5
which	5
the	5
host	5
made	5
him	5
a	5
free	5
gift;	5
and	5
over	5
the	5
flask	5
he	5
repeated	5
more	5
than	5
eighty	5
paternosters	5
and	5
as	5
many	5
more	5
ave-marias,	5
salves,	5
and	5
credos,	5
accompanying	5
each	5
word	5
with	5
a	5
cross	5
by	5
way	5
of	5
benediction,	5
at	5
all	5
which	5
there	5
were	5
present	5
Sancho,	5
the	5
innkeeper,	5
and	5
the	5
cuadrillero;	5
for	5
the	5
carrier	5
was	5
now	5
peacefully	5
engaged	5
in	5
attending	5
to	5
the	5
comfort	5
of	5
his	5
mules.	5
This	5
being	5
accomplished,	5
he	5
felt	5
anxious	5
to	5
make	5
trial	5
himself,	5
on	5
the	5
spot,	5
of	5
the	5
virtue	5
of	5
this	5
precious	5
balsam,	5
as	5
he	5
considered	5
it,	5
and	5
so	5
he	5
drank	5
near	5
a	5
quart	5
of	5
what	5
could	5
not	5
be	5
put	5
into	5
the	5
flask	5
and	5
remained	5
in	5
the	5
pigskin	5
in	5
which	5
it	5
had	5
been	5
boiled;	5
but	5
scarcely	5
had	5
he	5
done	5
drinking	5
when	5
he	5
began	5
to	5
vomit	5
in	5
such	5
a	5
way	5
that	5
nothing	5
was	5
left	5
in	5
his	5
stomach,	5
and	5
with	5
the	5
pangs	5
and	5
spasms	5
of	5
vomiting	5
he	5
broke	5
into	5
a	5
profuse	5
sweat,	5
on	5
account	5
of	5
which	5
he	5
bade	5
them	5
cover	5
him	5
up	5
and	5
leave	5
him	5
alone.	5
They	5
did	5
so,	5
and	5
he	5
lay	5
sleeping	5
more	5
than	5
three	5
hours,	5
at	5
the	5
end	5
of	5
which	5
he	5
awoke	5
and	5
felt	5
very	5
great	5
bodily	5
relief	5
and	5
so	5
much	5
ease	5
from	5
his	5
bruises	5
that	5
he	5
thought	5
himself	5
quite	5
cured,	5
and	5
verily	5
believed	5
he	5
had	5
hit	5
upon	5
the	5
balsam	5
of	5
Fierabras;	5
and	5
that	5
with	5
this	5
remedy	5
he	5
might	5
thenceforward,	5
without	5
any	5
fear,	5
face	5
any	5
kind	5
of	5
destruction,	5
battle,	5
or	5
combat,	5
however	5
perilous	5
it	5
might	5
be.	5
Sancho	5
Panza,	5
who	5
also	5
regarded	5
the	5
amendment	5
of	5
his	5
master	5
as	5
miraculous,	5
begged	5
him	5
to	5
give	5
him	5
what	5
was	5
left	5
in	5
the	5
pigskin,	5
which	5
was	5
no	5
small	5
quantity.	5
Don	5
Quixote	5
consented,	5
and	5
he,	5
taking	5
it	5
with	5
both	5
hands,	5
in	5
good	5
faith	5
and	5
with	5
a	5
better	5
will,	5
gulped	5
down	5
and	5
drained	5
off	5
very	5
little	5
less	5
than	5
his	5
master.	5
But	5
the	5
fact	5
is,	5
that	5
the	5
stomach	5
of	5
poor	5
Sancho	5
was	5
of	5
necessity	5
not	5
so	5
delicate	5
as	5
that	5
of	5
his	5
master,	5
and	5
so,	5
before	5
vomiting,	5
he	5
was	5
seized	5
with	5
such	5
gripings	5
and	5
retchings,	5
and	5
such	5
sweats	5
and	5
faintness,	5
that	5
verily	5
and	5
truly	5
he	5
believed	5
his	5
last	5
hour	5
had	5
come,	5
and	5
finding	5
himself	5
so	5
racked	5
and	5
tormented	5
he	5
cursed	5
the	5
balsam	5
and	5
the	5
thief	5
that	5
had	5
given	5
it	5
to	5
him.	5
Don	5
Quixote	5
seeing	5
him	5
in	5
this	5
state	5
said,	5
“It	5
is	5
my	5
belief,	5
Sancho,	5
that	5
this	5
mischief	5
comes	5
of	5
thy	5
not	5
being	5
dubbed	5
a	5
knight,	5
for	5
I	5
am	5
persuaded	5
this	5
liquor	5
cannot	5
be	5
good	5
for	5
those	5
who	5
are	5
not	5
so.”	5
“If	5
your	5
worship	5
knew	5
that,”	5
returned	5
Sancho—“woe	5
betide	5
me	5
and	5
all	5
my	5
kindred!—why	5
did	5
you	5
let	5
me	5
taste	5
it?”	5
At	5
this	5
moment	5
the	5
draught	5
took	5
effect,	5
and	5
the	5
poor	5
squire	5
began	5
to	5
discharge	5
both	5
ways	5
at	5
such	5
a	5
rate	5
that	5
the	5
rush	5
mat	5
on	5
which	5
he	5
had	5
thrown	5
himself	5
and	5
the	5
canvas	5
blanket	5
he	5
had	5
covering	5
him	5
were	5
fit	5
for	5
nothing	5
afterwards.	5
He	5
sweated	5
and	5
perspired	5
with	5
such	5
paroxysms	5
and	5
convulsions	5
that	5
not	5
only	5
he	5
himself	5
but	5
all	5
present	5
thought	5
his	5
end	5
had	5
come.	5
This	5
tempest	5
and	5
tribulation	5
lasted	5
about	5
two	5
hours,	5
at	5
the	5
end	5
of	5
which	5
he	5
was	5
left,	5
not	5
like	5
his	5
master,	5
but	5
so	5
weak	5
and	5
exhausted	5
that	5
he	5
could	5
not	5
stand.	5
Don	5
Quixote,	5
however,	5
who,	5
as	5
has	5
been	5
said,	5
felt	5
himself	5
relieved	5
and	5
well,	5
was	5
eager	5
to	5
take	5
his	5
departure	5
at	5
once	5
in	5
quest	5
of	5
adventures,	5
as	5
it	5
seemed	5
to	5
him	5
that	5
all	5
the	5
time	5
he	5
loitered	5
there	5
was	5
a	5
fraud	5
upon	5
the	5
world	5
and	5
those	5
in	5
it	5
who	5
stood	5
in	5
need	5
of	5
his	5
help	5
and	5
protection,	5
all	5
the	5
more	5
when	5
he	5
had	5
the	5
security	5
and	5
confidence	5
his	5
balsam	5
afforded	5
him;	5
and	5
so,	5
urged	5
by	5
this	5
impulse,	5
he	5
saddled	5
Rocinante	5
himself	5
and	5
put	5
the	5
pack-saddle	5
on	5
his	5
squire’s	5
beast,	5
whom	5
likewise	5
he	5
helped	5
to	5
dress	5
and	5
mount	5
the	5
ass;	5
after	5
which	5
he	5
mounted	5
his	5
horse	5
and	5
turning	5
to	5
a	5
corner	5
of	5
the	5
inn	5
he	5
laid	5
hold	5
of	5
a	5
pike	5
that	5
stood	5
there,	5
to	5
serve	5
him	5
by	5
way	5
of	5
a	5
lance.	5
All	5
that	5
were	5
in	5
the	5
inn,	5
who	5
were	5
more	5
than	5
twenty	5
persons,	5
stood	5
watching	5
him;	5
the	5
innkeeper’s	5
daughter	5
was	5
likewise	5
observing	5
him,	5
and	5
he	5
too	5
never	5
took	5
his	5
eyes	5
off	5
her,	5
and	5
from	5
time	5
to	5
time	5
fetched	5
a	5
sigh	5
that	5
he	5
seemed	5
to	5
pluck	5
up	5
from	5
the	5
depths	5
of	5
his	5
bowels;	5
but	5
they	5
all	5
thought	5
it	5
must	5
be	5
from	5
the	5
pain	5
he	5
felt	5
in	5
his	5
ribs;	5
at	5
any	5
rate	5
they	5
who	5
had	5
seen	5
him	5
plastered	5
the	5
night	5
before	5
thought	5
so.	5
As	5
soon	5
as	5
they	5
were	5
both	5
mounted,	5
at	5
the	5
gate	5
of	5
the	5
inn,	5
he	5
called	5
to	5
the	5
host	5
and	5
said	5
in	5
a	5
very	5
grave	5
and	5
measured	5
voice,	5
“Many	5
and	5
great	5
are	5
the	5
favours,	5
Señor	5
Alcaide,	5
that	5
I	5
have	5
received	5
in	5
this	5
castle	5
of	5
yours,	5
and	5
I	5
remain	5
under	5
the	5
deepest	5
obligation	5
to	5
be	5
grateful	5
to	5
you	5
for	5
them	5
all	5
the	5
days	5
of	5
my	5
life;	5
if	5
I	5
can	5
repay	5
them	5
in	5
avenging	5
you	5
of	5
any	5
arrogant	5
foe	5
who	5
may	5
have	5
wronged	5
you,	5
know	5
that	5
my	5
calling	5
is	5
no	5
other	5
than	5
to	5
aid	5
the	5
weak,	5
to	5
avenge	5
those	5
who	5
suffer	5
wrong,	5
and	5
to	5
chastise	5
perfidy.	5
Search	5
your	5
memory,	5
and	5
if	5
you	5
find	5
anything	5
of	5
this	5
kind	5
you	5
need	5
only	5
tell	5
me	5
of	5
it,	5
and	5
I	5
promise	5
you	5
by	5
the	5
order	5
of	5
knighthood	5
which	5
I	5
have	5
received	5
to	5
procure	5
you	5
satisfaction	5
and	5
reparation	5
to	5
the	5
utmost	5
of	5
your	5
desire.”	5
The	5
innkeeper	5
replied	5
to	5
him	5
with	5
equal	5
calmness,	5
“Sir	5
Knight,	5
I	5
do	5
not	5
want	5
your	5
worship	5
to	5
avenge	5
me	5
of	5
any	5
wrong,	5
because	5
when	5
any	5
is	5
done	5
me	5
I	5
can	5
take	5
what	5
vengeance	5
seems	5
good	5
to	5
me;	5
the	5
only	5
thing	5
I	5
want	5
is	5
that	5
you	5
pay	5
me	5
the	5
score	5
that	5
you	5
have	5
run	5
up	5
in	5
the	5
inn	5
last	5
night,	5
as	5
well	5
for	5
the	5
straw	5
and	5
barley	5
for	5
your	5
two	5
beasts,	5
as	5
for	5
supper	5
and	5
beds.”	5

“Then	5
this	5
is	5
an	5
inn?”	5
said	5
Don	5
Quixote.	5
“And	5
a	5
very	5
respectable	5
one,”	5
said	5
the	5
innkeeper.	5
“I	5
have	5
been	5
under	5
a	5
mistake	5
all	5
this	5
time,”	5
answered	5
Don	5
Quixote,	5
“for	5
in	5
truth	5
I	5
thought	5
it	5
was	5
a	5
castle,	5
and	5
not	5
a	5
bad	5
one;	5
but	5
since	5
it	5
appears	5
that	5
it	5
is	5
not	5
a	5
castle	5
but	5
an	5
inn,	5
all	5
that	5
can	5
be	5
done	5
now	5
is	5
that	5
you	5
should	5
excuse	5
the	5
payment,	5
for	5
I	5
cannot	5
contravene	5
the	5
rule	5
of	5
knights-errant,	5
of	5
whom	5
I	5
know	5
as	5
a	5
fact	5
(and	5
up	5
to	5
the	5
present	5
I	5
have	5
read	5
nothing	5
to	5
the	5
contrary)	5
that	5
they	5
never	5
paid	5
for	5
lodging	5
or	5
anything	5
else	5
in	5
the	5
inn	5
where	5
they	5
might	5
be;	5
for	5
any	5
hospitality	5
that	5
might	5
be	5
offered	5
them	5
is	5
their	5
due	5
by	5
law	5
and	5
right	5
in	5
return	5
for	5
the	5
insufferable	5
toil	5
they	5
endure	5
in	5
seeking	5
adventures	5
by	5
night	5
and	5
by	5
day,	5
in	5
summer	5
and	5
in	5
winter,	5
on	5
foot	5
and	5
on	5
horseback,	5
in	5
hunger	5
and	5
thirst,	5
cold	5
and	5
heat,	5
exposed	5
to	5
all	5
the	5
inclemencies	5
of	5
heaven	5
and	5
all	5
the	5
hardships	5
of	5
earth.”	5
“I	5
have	5
little	5
to	5
do	5
with	5
that,”	5
replied	5
the	5
innkeeper;	5
“pay	5
me	5
what	5
you	5
owe	5
me,	5
and	5
let	5
us	5
have	5
no	5
more	5
talk	5
of	5
chivalry,	5
for	5
all	5
I	5
care	5
about	5
is	5
to	5
get	5
my	5
money.”	5
“You	5
are	5
a	5
stupid,	5
scurvy	5
innkeeper,”	5
said	5
Don	5
Quixote,	5
and	5
putting	5
spurs	5
to	5
Rocinante	5
and	5
bringing	5
his	5
pike	5
to	5
the	5
slope	5
he	5
rode	5
out	5
of	5
the	5
inn	5
before	5
anyone	5
could	5
stop	5
him,	5
and	5
pushed	5
on	5
some	5
distance	5
without	5
looking	5
to	5
see	5
if	5
his	5
squire	5
was	5
following	5
him.	5
The	5
innkeeper	5
when	5
he	5
saw	5
him	5
go	5
without	5
paying	5
him	5
ran	5
to	5
get	5
payment	5
of	5
Sancho,	5
who	5
said	5
that	5
as	5
his	5
master	5
would	5
not	5
pay	5
neither	5
would	5
he,	5
because,	5
being	5
as	5
he	5
was	5
squire	5
to	5
a	5
knight-errant,	5
the	5
same	5
rule	5
and	5
reason	5
held	5
good	5
for	5
him	5
as	5
for	5
his	5
master	5
with	5
regard	5
to	5
not	5
paying	5
anything	5
in	5
inns	5
and	5
hostelries.	5
At	5
this	5
the	5
innkeeper	5
waxed	5
very	5
wroth,	5
and	5
threatened	5
if	5
he	5
did	5
not	5
pay	5
to	5
compel	5
him	5
in	5
a	5
way	5
that	5
he	5
would	5
not	5
like.	5
To	5
which	5
Sancho	5
made	5
answer	5
that	5
by	5
the	5
law	5
of	5
chivalry	5
his	5
master	5
had	5
received	5
he	5
would	5
not	5
pay	5
a	5
rap,	5
though	5
it	5
cost	5
him	5
his	5
life;	5
for	5
the	5
excellent	5
and	5
ancient	5
usage	5
of	5
knights-errant	5
was	5
not	5
going	5
to	5
be	5
violated	5
by	5
him,	5
nor	5
should	5
the	5
squires	5
of	5
such	5
as	5
were	5
yet	5
to	5
come	5
into	5
the	5
world	5
ever	5
complain	5
of	5
him	5
or	5
reproach	5
him	5
with	5
breaking	5
so	5
just	5
a	5
privilege.	5
The	5
ill-luck	5
of	5
the	5
unfortunate	5
Sancho	5
so	5
ordered	5
it	5
that	5
among	5
the	5
company	5
in	5
the	5
inn	5
there	5
were	5
four	5
woolcarders	5
from	5
Segovia,	5
three	5
needle-makers	5
from	5
the	5
Colt	5
of	5
Cordova,	5
and	5
two	5
lodgers	5
from	5
the	5
Fair	5
of	5
Seville,	5
lively	5
fellows,	5
tender-hearted,	5
fond	5
of	5
a	5
joke,	5
and	5
playful,	5
who,	5
almost	5
as	5
if	5
instigated	5
and	5
moved	5
by	5
a	5
common	5
impulse,	5
made	5
up	5
to	5
Sancho	5
and	5
dismounted	5
him	5
from	5
his	5
ass,	5
while	5
one	5
of	5
them	5
went	5
in	5
for	5
the	5
blanket	5
of	5
the	5
host’s	5
bed;	5
but	5
on	5
flinging	5
him	5
into	5
it	5
they	5
looked	5
up,	5
and	5
seeing	5
that	5
the	5
ceiling	5
was	5
somewhat	5
lower	5
than	5
what	5
they	5
required	5
for	5
their	5
work,	5
they	5
decided	5
upon	5
going	5
out	5
into	5
the	5
yard,	5
which	5
was	5
bounded	5
by	5
the	5
sky,	5
and	5
there,	5
putting	5
Sancho	5
in	5
the	5
middle	5
of	5
the	5
blanket,	5
they	5
began	5
to	5
raise	5
him	5
high,	5
making	5
sport	5
with	5
him	5
as	5
they	5
would	5
with	5
a	5
dog	5
at	5
Shrovetide.	5

The	5
cries	5
of	5
the	5
poor	5
blanketed	5
wretch	5
were	5
so	5
loud	5
that	5
they	5
reached	5
the	5
ears	5
of	5
his	5
master,	5
who,	5
halting	5
to	5
listen	5
attentively,	5
was	5
persuaded	5
that	5
some	5
new	5
adventure	5
was	5
coming,	5
until	5
he	5
clearly	5
perceived	5
that	5
it	5
was	5
his	5
squire	5
who	5
uttered	5
them.	5
Wheeling	5
about	5
he	5
came	5
up	5
to	5
the	5
inn	5
with	5
a	5
laborious	5
gallop,	5
and	5
finding	5
it	5
shut	5
went	5
round	5
it	5
to	5
see	5
if	5
he	5
could	5
find	5
some	5
way	5
of	5
getting	5
in;	5
but	5
as	5
soon	5
as	5
he	5
came	5
to	5
the	5
wall	5
of	5
the	5
yard,	5
which	5
was	5
not	5
very	5
high,	5
he	5
discovered	5
the	5
game	5
that	5
was	5
being	5
played	5
with	5
his	5
squire.	5
He	5
saw	5
him	5
rising	5
and	5
falling	5
in	5
the	5
air	5
with	5
such	5
grace	5
and	5
nimbleness	5
that,	5
had	5
his	5
rage	5
allowed	5
him,	5
it	5
is	5
my	5
belief	5
he	5
would	5
have	5
laughed.	5
He	5
tried	5
to	5
climb	5
from	5
his	5
horse	5
on	5
to	5
the	5
top	5
of	5
the	5
wall,	5
but	5
he	5
was	5
so	5
bruised	5
and	5
battered	5
that	5
he	5
could	5
not	5
even	5
dismount;	5
and	5
so	5
from	5
the	5
back	5
of	5
his	5
horse	5
he	5
began	5
to	5
utter	5
such	5
maledictions	5
and	5
objurgations	5
against	5
those	5
who	5
were	5
blanketing	5
Sancho	5
as	5
it	5
would	5
be	5
impossible	5
to	5
write	5
down	5
accurately:	5
they,	5
however,	5
did	5
not	5
stay	5
their	5
laughter	5
or	5
their	5
work	5
for	5
this,	5
nor	5
did	5
the	5
flying	5
Sancho	5
cease	5
his	5
lamentations,	5
mingled	5
now	5
with	5
threats,	5
now	5
with	5
entreaties	5
but	5
all	5
to	5
little	5
purpose,	5
or	5
none	5
at	5
all,	5
until	5
from	5
pure	5
weariness	5
they	5
left	5
off.	5
They	5
then	5
brought	5
him	5
his	5
ass,	5
and	5
mounting	5
him	5
on	5
top	5
of	5
it	5
they	5
put	5
his	5
jacket	5
round	5
him;	5
and	5
the	5
compassionate	5
Maritornes,	5
seeing	5
him	5
so	5
exhausted,	5
thought	5
fit	5
to	5
refresh	5
him	5
with	5
a	5
jug	5
of	5
water,	5
and	5
that	5
it	5
might	5
be	5
all	5
the	5
cooler	5
she	5
fetched	5
it	5
from	5
the	5
well.	5
Sancho	5
took	5
it,	5
and	5
as	5
he	5
was	5
raising	5
it	5
to	5
his	5
mouth	5
he	5
was	5
stopped	5
by	5
the	5
cries	5
of	5
his	5
master	5
exclaiming,	5
“Sancho,	5
my	5
son,	5
drink	5
not	5
water;	5
drink	5
it	5
not,	5
my	5
son,	5
for	5
it	5
will	5
kill	5
thee;	5
see,	5
here	5
I	5
have	5
the	5
blessed	5
balsam	5
(and	5
he	5
held	5
up	5
the	5
flask	5
of	5
liquor),	5
and	5
with	5
drinking	5
two	5
drops	5
of	5
it	5
thou	5
wilt	5
certainly	5
be	5
restored.”	5
At	5
these	5
words	5
Sancho	5
turned	5
his	5
eyes	5
asquint,	5
and	5
in	5
a	5
still	5
louder	5
voice	5
said,	5
“Can	5
it	5
be	5
your	5
worship	5
has	5
forgotten	5
that	5
I	5
am	5
not	5
a	5
knight,	5
or	5
do	5
you	5
want	5
me	5
to	5
end	5
by	5
vomiting	5
up	5
what	5
bowels	5
I	5
have	5
left	5
after	5
last	5
night?	5
Keep	5
your	5
liquor	5
in	5
the	5
name	5
of	5
all	5
the	5
devils,	5
and	5
leave	5
me	5
to	5
myself!”	5
and	5
at	5
one	5
and	5
the	5
same	5
instant	5
he	5
left	5
off	5
talking	5
and	5
began	5
drinking;	5
but	5
as	5
at	5
the	5
first	5
sup	5
he	5
perceived	5
it	5
was	5
water	5
he	5
did	5
not	5
care	5
to	5
go	5
on	5
with	5
it,	5
and	5
begged	5
Maritornes	5
to	5
fetch	5
him	5
some	5
wine,	5
which	5
she	5
did	5
with	5
right	5
good	5
will,	5
and	5
paid	5
for	5
it	5
with	5
her	5
own	5
money;	5
for	5
indeed	5
they	5
say	5
of	5
her	5
that,	5
though	5
she	5
was	5
in	5
that	5
line	5
of	5
life,	5
there	5
was	5
some	5
faint	5
and	5
distant	5
resemblance	5
to	5
a	5
Christian	5
about	5
her.	5
When	5
Sancho	5
had	5
done	5
drinking	5
he	5
dug	5
his	5
heels	5
into	5
his	5
ass,	5
and	5
the	5
gate	5
of	5
the	5
inn	5
being	5
thrown	5
open	5
he	5
passed	5
out	5
very	5
well	5
pleased	5
at	5
having	5
paid	5
nothing	5
and	5
carried	5
his	5
point,	5
though	5
it	5
had	5
been	5
at	5
the	5
expense	5
of	5
his	5
usual	5
sureties,	5
his	5
shoulders.	5
It	5
is	5
true	5
that	5
the	5
innkeeper	5
detained	5
his	5
alforjas	5
in	5
payment	5
of	5
what	5
was	5
owing	5
to	5
him,	5
but	5
Sancho	5
took	5
his	5
departure	5
in	5
such	5
a	5
flurry	5
that	5
he	5
never	5
missed	5
them.	5
The	5
innkeeper,	5
as	5
soon	5
as	5
he	5
saw	5
him	5
off,	5
wanted	5
to	5
bar	5
the	5
gate	5
close,	5
but	5
the	5
blanketers	5
would	5
not	5
agree	5
to	5
it,	5
for	5
they	5
were	5
fellows	5
who	5
would	5
not	5
have	5
cared	5
two	5
farthings	5
for	5
Don	5
Quixote,	5
even	5
had	5
he	5
been	5
really	5
one	5
of	5
the	5
knights-errant	5
of	5
the	5
Round	5

Sancho	5
reached	5
his	5
master	5
so	5
limp	5
and	5
faint	5
that	5
he	5
could	5
not	5
urge	5
on	5
his	5
beast.	5
When	5
Don	5
Quixote	5
saw	5
the	5
state	5
he	5
was	5
in	5
he	5
said,	5
“I	5
have	5
now	5
come	5
to	5
the	5
conclusion,	5
good	5
Sancho,	5
that	5
this	5
castle	5
or	5
inn	5
is	5
beyond	5
a	5
doubt	5
enchanted,	5
because	5
those	5
who	5
have	5
so	5
atrociously	5
diverted	5
themselves	5
with	5
thee,	5
what	5
can	5
they	5
be	5
but	5
phantoms	5
or	5
beings	5
of	5
another	5
world?	5
and	5
I	5
hold	5
this	5
confirmed	5
by	5
having	5
noticed	5
that	5
when	5
I	5
was	5
by	5
the	5
wall	5
of	5
the	5
yard	5
witnessing	5
the	5
acts	5
of	5
thy	5
sad	5
tragedy,	5
it	5
was	5
out	5
of	5
my	5
power	5
to	5
mount	5
upon	5
it,	5
nor	5
could	5
I	5
even	5
dismount	5
from	5
Rocinante,	5
because	5
they	5
no	5
doubt	5
had	5
me	5
enchanted;	5
for	5
I	5
swear	5
to	5
thee	5
by	5
the	5
faith	5
of	5
what	5
I	5
am	5
that	5
if	5
I	5
had	5
been	5
able	5
to	5
climb	5
up	5
or	5
dismount,	5
I	5
would	5
have	5
avenged	5
thee	5
in	5
such	5
a	5
way	5
that	5
those	5
braggart	5
thieves	5
would	5
have	5
remembered	5
their	5
freak	5
for	5
ever,	5
even	5
though	5
in	5
so	5
doing	5
I	5
knew	5
that	5
I	5
contravened	5
the	5
laws	5
of	5
chivalry,	5
which,	5
as	5
I	5
have	5
often	5
told	5
thee,	5
do	5
not	5
permit	5
a	5
knight	5
to	5
lay	5
hands	5
on	5
him	5
who	5
is	5
not	5
one,	5
save	5
in	5
case	5
of	5
urgent	5
and	5
great	5
necessity	5
in	5
defence	5
of	5
his	5
own	5
life	5
and	5
person.”	5
“I	5
would	5
have	5
avenged	5
myself	5
too	5
if	5
I	5
could,”	5
said	5
Sancho,	5
“whether	5
I	5
had	5
been	5
dubbed	5
knight	5
or	5
not,	5
but	5
I	5
could	5
not;	5
though	5
for	5
my	5
part	5
I	5
am	5
persuaded	5
those	5
who	5
amused	5
themselves	5
with	5
me	5
were	5
not	5
phantoms	5
or	5
enchanted	5
men,	5
as	5
your	5
worship	5
says,	5
but	5
men	5
of	5
flesh	5
and	5
bone	5
like	5
ourselves;	5
and	5
they	5
all	5
had	5
their	5
names,	5
for	5
I	5
heard	5
them	5
name	5
them	5
when	5
they	5
were	5
tossing	5
me,	5
and	5
one	5
was	5
called	5
Pedro	5
Martinez,	5
and	5
another	5
Tenorio	5
Hernandez,	5
and	5
the	5
innkeeper,	5
I	5
heard,	5
was	5
called	5
Juan	5
Palomeque	5
the	5
Left-handed;	5
so	5
that,	5
señor,	5
your	5
not	5
being	5
able	5
to	5
leap	5
over	5
the	5
wall	5
of	5
the	5
yard	5
or	5
dismount	5
from	5
your	5
horse	5
came	5
of	5
something	5
else	5
besides	5
enchantments;	5
and	5
what	5
I	5
make	5
out	5
clearly	5
from	5
all	5
this	5
is,	5
that	5
these	5
adventures	5
we	5
go	5
seeking	5
will	5
in	5
the	5
end	5
lead	5
us	5
into	5
such	5
misadventures	5
that	5
we	5
shall	5
not	5
know	5
which	5
is	5
our	5
right	5
foot;	5
and	5
that	5
the	5
best	5
and	5
wisest	5
thing,	5
according	5
to	5
my	5
small	5
wits,	5
would	5
be	5
for	5
us	5
to	5
return	5
home,	5
now	5
that	5
it	5
is	5
harvest-time,	5
and	5
attend	5
to	5
our	5
business,	5
and	5
give	5
over	5
wandering	5
from	5
Zeca	5
to	5
Mecca	5
and	5
from	5
pail	5
to	5
bucket,	5
as	5
the	5
saying	5
is.”	5
“How	5
little	5
thou	5
knowest	5
about	5
chivalry,	5
Sancho,”	5
replied	5
Don	5
Quixote;	5
“hold	5
thy	5
peace	5
and	5
have	5
patience;	5
the	5
day	5
will	5
come	5
when	5
thou	5
shalt	5
see	5
with	5
thine	5
own	5
eyes	5
what	5
an	5
honourable	5
thing	5
it	5
is	5
to	5
wander	5
in	5
the	5
pursuit	5
of	5
this	5
calling;	5
nay,	5
tell	5
me,	5
what	5
greater	5
pleasure	5
can	5
there	5
be	5
in	5
the	5
world,	5
or	5
what	5
delight	5
can	5
equal	5
that	5
of	5
winning	5
a	5
battle,	5
and	5
triumphing	5
over	5
one’s	5
enemy?	5
None,	5
beyond	5
all	5
doubt.”	5
“Very	5
likely,”	5
answered	5
Sancho,	5
“though	5
I	5
do	5
not	5
know	5
it;	5
all	5
I	5
know	5
is	5
that	5
since	5
we	5
have	5
been	5
knights-errant,	5
or	5
since	5
your	5
worship	5
has	5
been	5
one	5
(for	5
I	5
have	5
no	5
right	5
to	5
reckon	5
myself	5
one	5
of	5
so	5
honourable	5
a	5
number)	5
we	5
have	5
never	5
won	5
any	5
battle	5
except	5
the	5
one	5
with	5
the	5
Biscayan,	5
and	5
even	5
out	5
of	5
that	5
your	5
worship	5
came	5
with	5
half	5
an	5
ear	5
and	5
half	5
a	5
helmet	5
the	5
less;	5
and	5
from	5
that	5
till	5
now	5
it	5
has	5
been	5
all	5
cudgellings	5
and	5
more	5
cudgellings,	5
cuffs	5
and	5
more	5
cuffs,	5
I	5
getting	5
the	5
blanketing	5
over	5
and	5
above,	5
and	5
falling	5
in	5
with	5
enchanted	5
persons	5
on	5
whom	5
I	5
cannot	5
avenge	5
myself	5
so	5
as	5
to	5
know	5
what	5
the	5
delight,	5
as	5
your	5
worship	5
calls	5
it,	5
of	5
conquering	5
an	5
enemy	5
is	5
like.”	5
“That	5
is	5
what	5
vexes	5
me,	5
and	5
what	5
ought	5
to	5
vex	5
thee,	5
Sancho,”	5
replied	5
Don	5
Quixote;	5
“but	5
henceforward	5
I	5
will	5
endeavour	5
to	5
have	5
at	5
hand	5
some	5
sword	5
made	5
by	5
such	5
craft	5
that	5
no	5
kind	5
of	5
enchantments	5
can	5
take	5
effect	5
upon	5
him	5
who	5
carries	5
it,	5
and	5
it	5
is	5
even	5
possible	5
that	5
fortune	5
may	5
procure	5
for	5
me	5
that	5
which	5
belonged	5
to	5
Amadis	5
when	5
he	5
was	5
called	5
‘The	5
Knight	5
of	5
the	5
Burning	5
Sword,’	5
which	5
was	5
one	5
of	5
the	5
best	5
swords	5
that	5
ever	5
knight	5
in	5
the	5
world	5
possessed,	5
for,	5
besides	5
having	5
the	5
said	5
virtue,	5
it	5
cut	5
like	5
a	5
razor,	5
and	5
there	5
was	5
no	5
armour,	5
however	5
strong	5
and	5
enchanted	5
it	5
might	5
be,	5
that	5
could	5
resist	5
it.”	5
“Such	5
is	5
my	5
luck,”	5
said	5
Sancho,	5
“that	5
even	5
if	5
that	5
happened	5
and	5
your	5
worship	5
found	5
some	5
such	5
sword,	5
it	5
would,	5
like	5
the	5
balsam,	5
turn	5
out	5
serviceable	5
and	5
good	5
for	5
dubbed	5
knights	5
only,	5
and	5
as	5
for	5
the	5
squires,	5
they	5
might	5
sup	5
sorrow.”	5
“Fear	5
not	5
that,	5
Sancho,”	5
said	5
Don	5
Quixote:	5
“Heaven	5
will	5
deal	5
better	5
by	5
thee.”	5
Thus	5
talking,	5
Don	5
Quixote	5
and	5
his	5
squire	5
were	5
going	5
along,	5
when,	5
on	5
the	5
road	5
they	5
were	5
following,	5
Don	5
Quixote	5
perceived	5
approaching	5
them	5
a	5
large	5
and	5
thick	5
cloud	5
of	5
dust,	5
on	5
seeing	5
which	5
he	5
turned	5
to	5
Sancho	5
and	5
said:	5
“This	5
is	5
the	5
day,	5
Sancho,	5
on	5
which	5
will	5
be	5
seen	5
the	5
boon	5
my	5
fortune	5
is	5
reserving	5
for	5
me;	5
this,	5
I	5
say,	5
is	5
the	5
day	5
on	5
which	5
as	5
much	5
as	5
on	5
any	5
other	5
shall	5
be	5
displayed	5
the	5
might	5
of	5
my	5
arm,	5
and	5
on	5
which	5
I	5
shall	5
do	5
deeds	5
that	5
shall	5
remain	5
written	5
in	5
the	5
book	5
of	5
fame	5
for	5
all	5
ages	5
to	5
come.	5
Seest	5
thou	5
that	5
cloud	5
of	5
dust	5
which	5
rises	5
yonder?	5
Well,	5
then,	5
all	5
that	5
is	5
churned	5
up	5
by	5
a	5
vast	5
army	5
composed	5
of	5
various	5
and	5
countless	5
nations	5
that	5
comes	5
marching	5
there.”	5
“According	5
to	5
that	5
there	5
must	5
be	5
two,”	5
said	5
Sancho,	5
“for	5
on	5
this	5
opposite	5
side	5
also	5
there	5
rises	5
just	5
such	5
another	5
cloud	5
of	5
dust.”	5
Don	5
Quixote	5
turned	5
to	5
look	5
and	5
found	5
that	5
it	5
was	5
true,	5
and	5
rejoicing	5
exceedingly,	5
he	5
concluded	5
that	5
they	5
were	5
two	5
armies	5
about	5
to	5
engage	5
and	5
encounter	5
in	5
the	5
midst	5
of	5
that	5
broad	5
plain;	5
for	5
at	5
all	5
times	5
and	5
seasons	5
his	5
fancy	5
was	5
full	5
of	5
the	5
battles,	5
enchantments,	5
adventures,	5
crazy	5
feats,	5
loves,	5
and	5
defiances	5
that	5
are	5
recorded	5
in	5
the	5
books	5
of	5
chivalry,	5
and	5
everything	5
he	5
said,	5
thought,	5
or	5
did	5
had	5
reference	5
to	5
such	5
things.	5
Now	5
the	5
cloud	5
of	5
dust	5
he	5
had	5
seen	5
was	5
raised	5
by	5
two	5
great	5
droves	5
of	5
sheep	5
coming	5
along	5
the	5
same	5
road	5
in	5
opposite	5
directions,	5
which,	5
because	5
of	5
the	5
dust,	5
did	5
not	5
become	5
visible	5
until	5
they	5
drew	5
near,	5
but	5
Don	5
Quixote	5
asserted	5
so	5
positively	5
that	5
they	5
were	5
armies	5
that	5
Sancho	5
was	5
led	5
to	5
believe	5
it	5
and	5
say,	5
“Well,	5
and	5
what	5
are	5
we	5
to	5
do,	5
señor?”	5

“What?”	5
said	5
Don	5
Quixote:	5
“give	5
aid	5
and	5
assistance	5
to	5
the	5
weak	5
and	5
those	5
who	5
need	5
it;	5
and	5
thou	5
must	5
know,	5
Sancho,	5
that	5
this	5
which	5
comes	5
opposite	5
to	5
us	5
is	5
conducted	5
and	5
led	5
by	5
the	5
mighty	5
emperor	5
Alifanfaron,	5
lord	5
of	5
the	5
great	5
isle	5
of	5
Trapobana;	5
this	5
other	5
that	5
marches	5
behind	5
me	5
is	5
that	5
of	5
his	5
enemy	5
the	5
king	5
of	5
the	5
Garamantas,	5
Pentapolin	5
of	5
the	5
Bare	5
Arm,	5
for	5
he	5
always	5
goes	5
into	5
battle	5
with	5
his	5
right	5
arm	5
bare.”	5
“But	5
why	5
are	5
these	5
two	5
lords	5
such	5
enemies?”	5
“They	5
are	5
at	5
enmity,”	5
replied	5
Don	5
Quixote,	5
“because	5
this	5
Alifanfaron	5
is	5
a	5
furious	5
pagan	5
and	5
is	5
in	5
love	5
with	5
the	5
daughter	5
of	5
Pentapolin,	5
who	5
is	5
a	5
very	5
beautiful	5
and	5
moreover	5
gracious	5
lady,	5
and	5
a	5
Christian,	5
and	5
her	5
father	5
is	5
unwilling	5
to	5
bestow	5
her	5
upon	5
the	5
pagan	5
king	5
unless	5
he	5
first	5
abandons	5
the	5
religion	5
of	5
his	5
false	5
prophet	5
Mahomet,	5
and	5
adopts	5
his	5
own.”	5
“By	5
my	5
beard,”	5
said	5
Sancho,	5
“but	5
Pentapolin	5
does	5
quite	5
right,	5
and	5
I	5
will	5
help	5
him	5
as	5
much	5
as	5
I	5
can.”	5
“In	5
that	5
thou	5
wilt	5
do	5
what	5
is	5
thy	5
duty,	5
Sancho,”	5
said	5
Don	5
Quixote;	5
“for	5
to	5
engage	5
in	5
battles	5
of	5
this	5
sort	5
it	5
is	5
not	5
requisite	5
to	5
be	5
a	5
dubbed	5
knight.”	5
“That	5
I	5
can	5
well	5
understand,”	5
answered	5
Sancho;	5
“but	5
where	5
shall	5
we	5
put	5
this	5
ass	5
where	5
we	5
may	5
be	5
sure	5
to	5
find	5
him	5
after	5
the	5
fray	5
is	5
over?	5
for	5
I	5
believe	5
it	5
has	5
not	5
been	5
the	5
custom	5
so	5
far	5
to	5
go	5
into	5
battle	5
on	5
a	5
beast	5
of	5
this	5
kind.”	5
“That	5
is	5
true,”	5
said	5
Don	5
Quixote,	5
“and	5
what	5
you	5
had	5
best	5
do	5
with	5
him	5
is	5
to	5
leave	5
him	5
to	5
take	5
his	5
chance	5
whether	5
he	5
be	5
lost	5
or	5
not,	5
for	5
the	5
horses	5
we	5
shall	5
have	5
when	5
we	5
come	5
out	5
victors	5
will	5
be	5
so	5
many	5
that	5
even	5
Rocinante	5
will	5
run	5
a	5
risk	5
of	5
being	5
changed	5
for	5
another.	5
But	5
attend	5
to	5
me	5
and	5
observe,	5
for	5
I	5
wish	5
to	5
give	5
thee	5
some	5
account	5
of	5
the	5
chief	5
knights	5
who	5
accompany	5
these	5
two	5
armies;	5
and	5
that	5
thou	5
mayest	5
the	5
better	5
see	5
and	5
mark,	5
let	5
us	5
withdraw	5
to	5
that	5
hillock	5
which	5
rises	5
yonder,	5
whence	5
both	5
armies	5
may	5
be	5
seen.”	5
They	5
did	5
so,	5
and	5
placed	5
themselves	5
on	5
a	5
rising	5
ground	5
from	5
which	5
the	5
two	5
droves	5
that	5
Don	5
Quixote	5
made	5
armies	5
of	5
might	5
have	5
been	5
plainly	5
seen	5
if	5
the	5
clouds	5
of	5
dust	5
they	5
raised	5
had	5
not	5
obscured	5
them	5
and	5
blinded	5
the	5
sight;	5
nevertheless,	5
seeing	5
in	5
his	5
imagination	5
what	5
he	5
did	5
not	5
see	5
and	5
what	5
did	5
not	5
exist,	5
he	5
began	5
thus	5
in	5
a	5
loud	5
voice:	5
“That	5
knight	5
whom	5
thou	5
seest	5
yonder	5
in	5
yellow	5
armour,	5
who	5
bears	5
upon	5
his	5
shield	5
a	5
lion	5
crowned	5
crouching	5
at	5
the	5
feet	5
of	5
a	5
damsel,	5
is	5
the	5
valiant	5
Laurcalco,	5
lord	5
of	5
the	5
Silver	5
Bridge;	5
that	5
one	5
in	5
armour	5
with	5
flowers	5
of	5
gold,	5
who	5
bears	5
on	5
his	5
shield	5
three	5
crowns	5
argent	5
on	5
an	5
azure	5
field,	5
is	5
the	5
dreaded	5
Micocolembo,	5
grand	5
duke	5
of	5
Quirocia;	5
that	5
other	5
of	5
gigantic	5
frame,	5
on	5
his	5
right	5
hand,	5
is	5
the	5
ever	5
dauntless	5
Brandabarbaran	5
de	5
Boliche,	5
lord	5
of	5
the	5
three	5
Arabias,	5
who	5
for	5
armour	5
wears	5
that	5
serpent	5
skin,	5
and	5
has	5
for	5
shield	5
a	5
gate	5
which,	5
according	5
to	5
tradition,	5
is	5
one	5
of	5
those	5
of	5
the	5
temple	5
that	5
Samson	5
brought	5
to	5
the	5
ground	5
when	5
by	5
his	5
death	5
he	5
revenged	5
himself	5
upon	5
his	5
enemies.	5
But	5
turn	5
thine	5
eyes	5
to	5
the	5
other	5
side,	5
and	5
thou	5
shalt	5
see	5
in	5
front	5
and	5
in	5
the	5
van	5
of	5
this	5
other	5
army	5
the	5
ever	5
victorious	5
and	5
never	5
vanquished	5
Timonel	5
of	5
Carcajona,	5
prince	5
of	5
New	5
Biscay,	5
who	5
comes	5
in	5
armour	5
with	5
arms	5
quartered	5
azure,	5
vert,	5
white,	5
and	5
yellow,	5
and	5
bears	5
on	5
his	5
shield	5
a	5
cat	5
or	5
on	5
a	5
field	5
tawny	5
with	5
a	5
motto	5
which	5
says	5
_Miau_,	5
which	5
is	5
the	5
beginning	5
of	5
the	5
name	5
of	5
his	5
lady,	5
who	5
according	5
to	5
report	5
is	5
the	5
peerless	5
Miaulina,	5
daughter	5
of	5
the	5
duke	5
Alfeniquen	5
of	5
the	5
Algarve;	5
the	5
other,	5
who	5
burdens	5
and	5
presses	5
the	5
loins	5
of	5
that	5
powerful	5
charger	5
and	5
bears	5
arms	5
white	5
as	5
snow	5
and	5
a	5
shield	5
blank	5
and	5
without	5
any	5
device,	5
is	5
a	5
novice	5
knight,	5
a	5
Frenchman	5
by	5
birth,	5
Pierres	5
Papin	5
by	5
name,	5
lord	5
of	5
the	5
baronies	5
of	5
Utrique;	5
that	5
other,	5
who	5
with	5
iron-shod	5
heels	5
strikes	5
the	5
flanks	5
of	5
that	5
nimble	5
parti-coloured	5
zebra,	5
and	5
for	5
arms	5
bears	5
azure	5
vair,	5
is	5
the	5
mighty	5
duke	5
of	5
Nerbia,	5
Espartafilardo	5
del	5
Bosque,	5
who	5
bears	5
for	5
device	5
on	5
his	5
shield	5
an	5
asparagus	5
plant	5
with	5
a	5
motto	5
in	5
Castilian	5
that	5
says,	5
_‘Rastrea	5
mi	5
suerte’_.”	5
And	5
so	5
he	5
went	5
on	5
naming	5
a	5
number	5
of	5
knights	5
of	5
one	5
squadron	5
or	5
the	5
other	5
out	5
of	5
his	5
imagination,	5
and	5
to	5
all	5
he	5
assigned	5
off-hand	5
their	5
arms,	5
colours,	5
devices,	5
and	5
mottoes,	5
carried	5
away	5
by	5
the	5
illusions	5
of	5
his	5
unheard-of	5
craze;	5
and	5
without	5
a	5
pause,	5
he	5
continued,	5
“People	5
of	5
divers	5
nations	5
compose	5
this	5
squadron	5
in	5
front;	5
here	5
are	5
those	5
that	5
drink	5
of	5
the	5
sweet	5
waters	5
of	5
the	5
famous	5
Xanthus,	5
those	5
that	5
scour	5
the	5
woody	5
Massilian	5
plains,	5
those	5
that	5
sift	5
the	5
pure	5
fine	5
gold	5
of	5
Arabia	5
Felix,	5
those	5
that	5
enjoy	5
the	5
famed	5
cool	5
banks	5
of	5
the	5
crystal	5
Thermodon,	5
those	5
that	5
in	5
many	5
and	5
various	5
ways	5
divert	5
the	5
streams	5
of	5
the	5
golden	5
Pactolus,	5
the	5
Numidians,	5
faithless	5
in	5
their	5
promises,	5
the	5
Persians	5
renowned	5
in	5
archery,	5
the	5
Parthians	5
and	5
the	5
Medes	5
that	5
fight	5
as	5
they	5
fly,	5
the	5
Arabs	5
that	5
ever	5
shift	5
their	5
dwellings,	5
the	5
Scythians	5
as	5
cruel	5
as	5
they	5
are	5
fair,	5
the	5
Ethiopians	5
with	5
pierced	5
lips,	5
and	5
an	5
infinity	5
of	5
other	5
nations	5
whose	5
features	5
I	5
recognise	5
and	5
descry,	5
though	5
I	5
cannot	5
recall	5
their	5
names.	5
In	5
this	5
other	5
squadron	5
there	5
come	5
those	5
that	5
drink	5
of	5
the	5
crystal	5
streams	5
of	5
the	5
olive-bearing	5
Betis,	5
those	5
that	5
make	5
smooth	5
their	5
countenances	5
with	5
the	5
water	5
of	5
the	5
ever	5
rich	5
and	5
golden	5
Tagus,	5
those	5
that	5
rejoice	5
in	5
the	5
fertilising	5
flow	5
of	5
the	5
divine	5
Genil,	5
those	5
that	5
roam	5
the	5
Tartesian	5
plains	5
abounding	5
in	5
pasture,	5
those	5
that	5
take	5
their	5
pleasure	5
in	5
the	5
Elysian	5
meadows	5
of	5
Jerez,	5
the	5
rich	5
Manchegans	5
crowned	5
with	5
ruddy	5
ears	5
of	5
corn,	5
the	5
wearers	5
of	5
iron,	5
old	5
relics	5
of	5
the	5
Gothic	5
race,	5
those	5
that	5
bathe	5
in	5
the	5
Pisuerga	5
renowned	5
for	5
its	5
gentle	5
current,	5
those	5
that	5
feed	5
their	5
herds	5
along	5
the	5
spreading	5
pastures	5
of	5
the	5
winding	5
Guadiana	5
famed	5
for	5
its	5
hidden	5
course,	5
those	5
that	5
tremble	5
with	5
the	5
cold	5
of	5
the	5
pineclad	5
Pyrenees	5
or	5
the	5
dazzling	5
snows	5
of	5
the	5
lofty	5
Apennine;	5
in	5
a	5
word,	5
as	5
many	5
as	5
all	5
Europe	5
includes	5
and	5
contains.”	5
Good	5
God!	5
what	5
a	5
number	5
of	5
countries	5
and	5
nations	5
he	5
named!	5
giving	5
to	5
each	5
its	5
proper	5
attributes	5
with	5
marvellous	5
readiness;	5
brimful	5
and	5
saturated	5
with	5
what	5
he	5
had	5
read	5
in	5
his	5
lying	5
books!	5
Sancho	5
Panza	5
hung	5
upon	5
his	5
words	5
without	5
speaking,	5
and	5
from	5
time	5
to	5
time	5
turned	5
to	5
try	5
if	5
he	5
could	5
see	5
the	5
knights	5
and	5
giants	5
his	5
master	5
was	5
describing,	5
and	5
as	5
he	5
could	5
not	5
make	5
out	5
one	5
of	5
them	5
he	5
said	5
to	5
him:	5
“Señor,	5
devil	5
take	5
it	5
if	5
there’s	5
a	5
sign	5
of	5
any	5
man	5
you	5
talk	5
of,	5
knight	5
or	5
giant,	5
in	5
the	5
whole	5
thing;	5
maybe	5
it’s	5
all	5
enchantment,	5
like	5
the	5
phantoms	5
last	5
night.”	5
“How	5
canst	5
thou	5
say	5
that!”	5
answered	5
Don	5
Quixote;	5
“dost	5
thou	5
not	5
hear	5
the	5
neighing	5
of	5
the	5
steeds,	5
the	5
braying	5
of	5
the	5
trumpets,	5
the	5
roll	5
of	5
the	5
drums?”	5
“I	5
hear	5
nothing	5
but	5
a	5
great	5
bleating	5
of	5
ewes	5
and	5
sheep,”	5
said	5
Sancho;	5
which	5
was	5
true,	5
for	5
by	5
this	5
time	5
the	5
two	5
flocks	5
had	5
come	5
close.	5
“The	5
fear	5
thou	5
art	5
in,	5
Sancho,”	5
said	5
Don	5
Quixote,	5
“prevents	5
thee	5
from	5
seeing	5
or	5
hearing	5
correctly,	5
for	5
one	5
of	5
the	5
effects	5
of	5
fear	5
is	5
to	5
derange	5
the	5
senses	5
and	5
make	5
things	5
appear	5
different	5
from	5
what	5
they	5
are;	5
if	5
thou	5
art	5
in	5
such	5
fear,	5
withdraw	5
to	5
one	5
side	5
and	5
leave	5
me	5
to	5
myself,	5
for	5
alone	5
I	5
suffice	5
to	5
bring	5
victory	5
to	5
that	5
side	5
to	5
which	5
I	5
shall	5
give	5
my	5
aid;”	5
and	5
so	5
saying	5
he	5
gave	5
Rocinante	5
the	5
spur,	5
and	5
putting	5
the	5
lance	5
in	5
rest,	5
shot	5
down	5
the	5
slope	5
like	5
a	5
thunderbolt.	5
Sancho	5
shouted	5
after	5
him,	5
crying,	5
“Come	5
back,	5
Señor	5
Don	5
Quixote;	5
I	5
vow	5
to	5
God	5
they	5
are	5
sheep	5
and	5
ewes	5
you	5
are	5
charging!	5
Come	5
back!	5
Unlucky	5
the	5
father	5
that	5
begot	5
me!	5
what	5
madness	5
is	5
this!	5
Look,	5
there	5
is	5
no	5
giant,	5
nor	5
knight,	5
nor	5
cats,	5
nor	5
arms,	5
nor	5
shields	5
quartered	5
or	5
whole,	5
nor	5
vair	5
azure	5
or	5
bedevilled.	5
What	5
are	5
you	5
about?	5
Sinner	5
that	5
I	5
am	5
before	5
God!”	5
But	5
not	5
for	5
all	5
these	5
entreaties	5
did	5
Don	5
Quixote	5
turn	5
back;	5
on	5
the	5
contrary	5
he	5
went	5
on	5
shouting	5
out,	5
“Ho,	5
knights,	5
ye	5
who	5
follow	5
and	5
fight	5
under	5
the	5
banners	5
of	5
the	5
valiant	5
emperor	5
Pentapolin	5
of	5
the	5
Bare	5
Arm,	5
follow	5
me	5
all;	5
ye	5
shall	5
see	5
how	5
easily	5
I	5
shall	5
give	5
him	5
his	5
revenge	5
over	5
his	5
enemy	5
Alifanfaron	5
of	5
the	5
Trapobana.”	5
So	5
saying,	5
he	5
dashed	5
into	5
the	5
midst	5
of	5
the	5
squadron	5
of	5
ewes,	5
and	5
began	5
spearing	5
them	5
with	5
as	5
much	5
spirit	5
and	5
intrepidity	5
as	5
if	5
he	5
were	5
transfixing	5
mortal	5
enemies	5
in	5
earnest.	5
The	5
shepherds	5
and	5
drovers	5
accompanying	5
the	5
flock	5
shouted	5
to	5
him	5
to	5
desist;	5
seeing	5
it	5
was	5
no	5
use,	5
they	5
ungirt	5
their	5
slings	5
and	5
began	5
to	5
salute	5
his	5
ears	5
with	5
stones	5
as	5
big	5
as	5
one’s	5
fist.	5
Don	5
Quixote	5
gave	5
no	5
heed	5
to	5
the	5
stones,	5
but,	5
letting	5
drive	5
right	5
and	5
left	5
kept	5
saying:	5
“Where	5
art	5
thou,	5
proud	5
Alifanfaron?	5
Come	5
before	5
me;	5
I	5
am	5
a	5
single	5
knight	5
who	5
would	5
fain	5
prove	5
thy	5
prowess	5
hand	5
to	5
hand,	5
and	5
make	5
thee	5
yield	5
thy	5
life	5
a	5
penalty	5
for	5
the	5
wrong	5
thou	5
dost	5
to	5
the	5
valiant	5
Pentapolin	5
Garamanta.”	5
Here	5
came	5
a	5
sugar-plum	5
from	5
the	5
brook	5
that	5
struck	5
him	5
on	5
the	5
side	5
and	5
buried	5
a	5
couple	5
of	5
ribs	5
in	5
his	5
body.	5
Feeling	5
himself	5
so	5
smitten,	5
he	5
imagined	5
himself	5
slain	5
or	5
badly	5
wounded	5
for	5
certain,	5
and	5
recollecting	5
his	5
liquor	5
he	5
drew	5
out	5
his	5
flask,	5
and	5
putting	5
it	5
to	5
his	5
mouth	5
began	5
to	5
pour	5
the	5
contents	5
into	5
his	5
stomach;	5
but	5
ere	5
he	5
had	5
succeeded	5
in	5
swallowing	5
what	5
seemed	5
to	5
him	5
enough,	5
there	5
came	5
another	5
almond	5
which	5
struck	5
him	5
on	5
the	5
hand	5
and	5
on	5
the	5
flask	5
so	5
fairly	5
that	5
it	5
smashed	5
it	5
to	5
pieces,	5
knocking	5
three	5
or	5
four	5
teeth	5
and	5
grinders	5
out	5
of	5
his	5
mouth	5
in	5
its	5
course,	5
and	5
sorely	5
crushing	5
two	5
fingers	5
of	5
his	5
hand.	5
Such	5
was	5
the	5
force	5
of	5
the	5
first	5
blow	5
and	5
of	5
the	5
second,	5
that	5
the	5
poor	5
knight	5
in	5
spite	5
of	5
himself	5
came	5
down	5
backwards	5
off	5
his	5
horse.	5
The	5
shepherds	5
came	5
up,	5
and	5
felt	5
sure	5
they	5
had	5
killed	5
him;	5
so	5
in	5
all	5
haste	5
they	5
collected	5
their	5
flock	5
together,	5
took	5
up	5
the	5
dead	5
beasts,	5
of	5
which	5
there	5
were	5
more	5
than	5
seven,	5
and	5
made	5
off	5
without	5
waiting	5
to	5
ascertain	5
anything	5
further.	5
All	5
this	5
time	5
Sancho	5
stood	5
on	5
the	5
hill	5
watching	5
the	5
crazy	5
feats	5
his	5
master	5
was	5
performing,	5
and	5
tearing	5
his	5
beard	5
and	5
cursing	5
the	5
hour	5
and	5
the	5
occasion	5
when	5
fortune	5
had	5
made	5
him	5
acquainted	5
with	5
him.	5
Seeing	5
him,	5
then,	5
brought	5
to	5
the	5
ground,	5
and	5
that	5
the	5
shepherds	5
had	5
taken	5
themselves	5
off,	5
he	5
ran	5
to	5
him	5
and	5
found	5
him	5
in	5
very	5
bad	5
case,	5
though	5
not	5
unconscious;	5
and	5
said	5
he:	5
“Did	5
I	5
not	5
tell	5
you	5
to	5
come	5
back,	5
Señor	5
Don	5
Quixote;	5
and	5
that	5
what	5
you	5
were	5
going	5
to	5
attack	5
were	5
not	5
armies	5
but	5
droves	5
of	5
sheep?”	5
“That’s	5
how	5
that	5
thief	5
of	5
a	5
sage,	5
my	5
enemy,	5
can	5
alter	5
and	5
falsify	5
things,”	5
answered	5
Don	5
Quixote;	5
“thou	5
must	5
know,	5
Sancho,	5
that	5
it	5
is	5
a	5
very	5
easy	5
matter	5
for	5
those	5
of	5
his	5
sort	5
to	5
make	5
us	5
believe	5
what	5
they	5
choose;	5
and	5
this	5
malignant	5
being	5
who	5
persecutes	5
me,	5
envious	5
of	5
the	5
glory	5
he	5
knew	5
I	5
was	5
to	5
win	5
in	5
this	5
battle,	5
has	5
turned	5
the	5
squadrons	5
of	5
the	5
enemy	5
into	5
droves	5
of	5
sheep.	5
At	5
any	5
rate,	5
do	5
this	5
much,	5
I	5
beg	5
of	5
thee,	5
Sancho,	5
to	5
undeceive	5
thyself,	5
and	5
see	5
that	5
what	5
I	5
say	5
is	5
true;	5
mount	5
thy	5
ass	5
and	5
follow	5
them	5
quietly,	5
and	5
thou	5
shalt	5
see	5
that	5
when	5
they	5
have	5
gone	5
some	5
little	5
distance	5
from	5
this	5
they	5
will	5
return	5
to	5
their	5
original	5
shape	5
and,	5
ceasing	5
to	5
be	5
sheep,	5
become	5
men	5
in	5
all	5
respects	5
as	5
I	5
described	5
them	5
to	5
thee	5
at	5
first.	5
But	5
go	5
not	5
just	5
yet,	5
for	5
I	5
want	5
thy	5
help	5
and	5
assistance;	5
come	5
hither,	5
and	5
see	5
how	5
many	5
of	5
my	5
teeth	5
and	5
grinders	5
are	5
missing,	5
for	5
I	5
feel	5
as	5
if	5
there	5
was	5
not	5
one	5
left	5
in	5
my	5
mouth.”	5
Sancho	5
came	5
so	5
close	5
that	5
he	5
almost	5
put	5
his	5
eyes	5
into	5
his	5
mouth;	5
now	5
just	5
at	5
that	5
moment	5
the	5
balsam	5
had	5
acted	5
on	5
the	5
stomach	5
of	5
Don	5
Quixote,	5
so,	5
at	5
the	5
very	5
instant	5
when	5
Sancho	5
came	5
to	5
examine	5
his	5
mouth,	5
he	5
discharged	5
all	5
its	5
contents	5
with	5
more	5
force	5
than	5
a	5
musket,	5
and	5
full	5
into	5
the	5
beard	5
of	5
the	5
compassionate	5
squire.	5
“Holy	5
Mary!”	5
cried	5
Sancho,	5
“what	5
is	5
this	5
that	5
has	5
happened	5
me?	5
Clearly	5
this	5
sinner	5
is	5
mortally	5
wounded,	5
as	5
he	5
vomits	5
blood	5
from	5
the	5
mouth;”	5
but	5
considering	5
the	5
matter	5
a	5
little	5
more	5
closely	5
he	5
perceived	5
by	5
the	5
colour,	5
taste,	5
and	5
smell,	5
that	5
it	5
was	5
not	5
blood	5
but	5
the	5
balsam	5
from	5
the	5
flask	5
which	5
he	5
had	5
seen	5
him	5
drink;	5
and	5
he	5
was	5
taken	5
with	5
such	5
a	5
loathing	5
that	5
his	5
stomach	5
turned,	5
and	5
he	5
vomited	5
up	5
his	5
inside	5
over	5
his	5
very	5
master,	5
and	5
both	5
were	5
left	5
in	5
a	5
precious	5
state.	5
Sancho	5
ran	5
to	5
his	5
ass	5
to	5
get	5
something	5
wherewith	5
to	5
clean	5
himself,	5
and	5
relieve	5
his	5
master,	5
out	5
of	5
his	5
alforjas;	5
but	5
not	5
finding	5
them,	5
he	5
well-nigh	5
took	5
leave	5
of	5
his	5
senses,	5
and	5
cursed	5
himself	5
anew,	5
and	5
in	5
his	5
heart	5
resolved	5
to	5
quit	5
his	5
master	5
and	5
return	5
home,	5
even	5
though	5
he	5
forfeited	5
the	5
wages	5
of	5
his	5
service	5
and	5
all	5
hopes	5
of	5
the	5
promised	5
island.	5
Don	5
Quixote	5
now	5
rose,	5
and	5
putting	5
his	5
left	5
hand	5
to	5
his	5
mouth	5
to	5
keep	5
his	5
teeth	5
from	5
falling	5
out	5
altogether,	5
with	5
the	5
other	5
he	5
laid	5
hold	5
of	5
the	5
bridle	5
of	5
Rocinante,	5
who	5
had	5
never	5
stirred	5
from	5
his	5
master’s	5
side—so	5
loyal	5
and	5
well-behaved	5
was	5
he—and	5
betook	5
himself	5
to	5
where	5
the	5
squire	5
stood	5
leaning	5
over	5
his	5
ass	5
with	5
his	5
hand	5
to	5
his	5
cheek,	5
like	5
one	5
in	5
deep	5
dejection.	5
Seeing	5
him	5
in	5
this	5
mood,	5
looking	5
so	5
sad,	5
Don	5
Quixote	5
said	5
to	5
him:	5
“Bear	5
in	5
mind,	5
Sancho,	5
that	5
one	5
man	5
is	5
no	5
more	5
than	5
another,	5
unless	5
he	5
does	5
more	5
than	5
another;	5
all	5
these	5
tempests	5
that	5
fall	5
upon	5
us	5
are	5
signs	5
that	5
fair	5
weather	5
is	5
coming	5
shortly,	5
and	5
that	5
things	5
will	5
go	5
well	5
with	5
us,	5
for	5
it	5
is	5
impossible	5
for	5
good	5
or	5
evil	5
to	5
last	5
for	5
ever;	5
and	5
hence	5
it	5
follows	5
that	5
the	5
evil	5
having	5
lasted	5
long,	5
the	5
good	5
must	5
be	5
now	5
nigh	5
at	5
hand;	5
so	5
thou	5
must	5
not	5
distress	5
thyself	5
at	5
the	5
misfortunes	5
which	5
happen	5
to	5
me,	5
since	5
thou	5
hast	5
no	5
share	5
in	5
them.”	5
“How	5
have	5
I	5
not?”	5
replied	5
Sancho;	5
“was	5
he	5
whom	5
they	5
blanketed	5
yesterday	5
perchance	5
any	5
other	5
than	5
my	5
father’s	5
son?	5
and	5
the	5
alforjas	5
that	5
are	5
missing	5
to-day	5
with	5
all	5
my	5
treasures,	5
did	5
they	5
belong	5
to	5
any	5
other	5
but	5
myself?”	5
“What!	5
are	5
the	5
alforjas	5
missing,	5
Sancho?”	5
said	5
Don	5
Quixote.	5
“Yes,	5
they	5
are	5
missing,”	5
answered	5
Sancho.	5
“In	5
that	5
case	5
we	5
have	5
nothing	5
to	5
eat	5
to-day,”	5
replied	5
Don	5
Quixote.	5
“It	5
would	5
be	5
so,”	5
answered	5
Sancho,	5
“if	5
there	5
were	5
none	5
of	5
the	5
herbs	5
your	5
worship	5
says	5
you	5
know	5
in	5
these	5
meadows,	5
those	5
with	5
which	5
knights-errant	5
as	5
unlucky	5
as	5
your	5
worship	5
are	5
wont	5
to	5
supply	5
such-like	5
shortcomings.”	5
“For	5
all	5
that,”	5
answered	5
Don	5
Quixote,	5
“I	5
would	5
rather	5
have	5
just	5
now	5
a	5
quarter	5
of	5
bread,	5
or	5
a	5
loaf	5
and	5
a	5
couple	5
of	5
pilchards’	5
heads,	5
than	5
all	5
the	5
herbs	5
described	5
by	5
Dioscorides,	5
even	5
with	5
Doctor	5
Laguna’s	5
notes.	5
Nevertheless,	5
Sancho	5
the	5
Good,	5
mount	5
thy	5
beast	5
and	5
come	5
along	5
with	5
me,	5
for	5
God,	5
who	5
provides	5
for	5
all	5
things,	5
will	5
not	5
fail	5
us	5
(more	5
especially	5
when	5
we	5
are	5
so	5
active	5
in	5
his	5
service	5
as	5
we	5
are),	5
since	5
he	5
fails	5
not	5
the	5
midges	5
of	5
the	5
air,	5
nor	5
the	5
grubs	5
of	5
the	5
earth,	5
nor	5
the	5
tadpoles	5
of	5
the	5
water,	5
and	5
is	5
so	5
merciful	5
that	5
he	5
maketh	5
his	5
sun	5
to	5
rise	5
on	5
the	5
good	5
and	5
on	5
the	5
evil,	5
and	5
sendeth	5
rain	5
on	5
the	5
unjust	5
and	5
on	5
the	5
just.”	5
“Your	5
worship	5
would	5
make	5
a	5
better	5
preacher	5
than	5
knight-errant,”	5
said	5
Sancho.	5
“Knights-errant	5
knew	5
and	5
ought	5
to	5
know	5
everything,	5
Sancho,”	5
said	5
Don	5
Quixote;	5
“for	5
there	5
were	5
knights-errant	5
in	5
former	5
times	5
as	5
well	5
qualified	5
to	5
deliver	5
a	5
sermon	5
or	5
discourse	5
in	5
the	5
middle	5
of	5
an	5
encampment,	5
as	5
if	5
they	5
had	5
graduated	5
in	5
the	5
University	5
of	5
Paris;	5
whereby	5
we	5
may	5
see	5
that	5
the	5
lance	5
has	5
never	5
blunted	5
the	5
pen,	5
nor	5
the	5
pen	5
the	5
lance.”	5
“Well,	5
be	5
it	5
as	5
your	5
worship	5
says,”	5
replied	5
Sancho;	5
“let	5
us	5
be	5
off	5
now	5
and	5
find	5
some	5
place	5
of	5
shelter	5
for	5
the	5
night,	5
and	5
God	5
grant	5
it	5
may	5
be	5
somewhere	5
where	5
there	5
are	5
no	5
blankets,	5
nor	5
blanketeers,	5
nor	5
phantoms,	5
nor	5
enchanted	5
Moors;	5
for	5
if	5
there	5
are,	5
may	5
the	5
devil	5
take	5
the	5
whole	5
concern.”	5
“Ask	5
that	5
of	5
God,	5
my	5
son,”	5
said	5
Don	5
Quixote;	5
and	5
do	5
thou	5
lead	5
on	5
where	5
thou	5
wilt,	5
for	5
this	5
time	5
I	5
leave	5
our	5
lodging	5
to	5
thy	5
choice;	5
but	5
reach	5
me	5
here	5
thy	5
hand,	5
and	5
feel	5
with	5
thy	5
finger,	5
and	5
find	5
out	5
how	5
many	5
of	5
my	5
teeth	5
and	5
grinders	5
are	5
missing	5
from	5
this	5
right	5
side	5
of	5
the	5
upper	5
jaw,	5
for	5
it	5
is	5
there	5
I	5
feel	5
the	5
pain.”	5
Sancho	5
put	5
in	5
his	5
fingers,	5
and	5
feeling	5
about	5
asked	5
him,	5
“How	5
many	5
grinders	5
used	5
your	5
worship	5
have	5
on	5
this	5
side?”	5
“Four,”	5
replied	5
Don	5
Quixote,	5
“besides	5
the	5
back-tooth,	5
all	5
whole	5
and	5
quite	5
sound.”	5
“Mind	5
what	5
you	5
are	5
saying,	5
señor.”	5
“I	5
say	5
four,	5
if	5
not	5
five,”	5
answered	5
Don	5
Quixote,	5
“for	5
never	5
in	5
my	5
life	5
have	5
I	5
had	5
tooth	5
or	5
grinder	5
drawn,	5
nor	5
has	5
any	5
fallen	5
out	5
or	5
been	5
destroyed	5
by	5
any	5
decay	5
or	5
rheum.”	5
“Well,	5
then,”	5
said	5
Sancho,	5
“in	5
this	5
lower	5
side	5
your	5
worship	5
has	5
no	5
more	5
than	5
two	5
grinders	5
and	5
a	5
half,	5
and	5
in	5
the	5
upper	5
neither	5
a	5
half	5
nor	5
any	5
at	5
all,	5
for	5
it	5
is	5
all	5
as	5
smooth	5
as	5
the	5
palm	5
of	5
my	5
hand.”	5
“Luckless	5
that	5
I	5
am!”	5
said	5
Don	5
Quixote,	5
hearing	5
the	5
sad	5
news	5
his	5
squire	5
gave	5
him;	5
“I	5
had	5
rather	5
they	5
despoiled	5
me	5
of	5
an	5
arm,	5
so	5
it	5
were	5
not	5
the	5
sword-arm;	5
for	5
I	5
tell	5
thee,	5
Sancho,	5
a	5
mouth	5
without	5
teeth	5
is	5
like	5
a	5
mill	5
without	5
a	5
millstone,	5
and	5
a	5
tooth	5
is	5
much	5
more	5
to	5
be	5
prized	5
than	5
a	5
diamond;	5
but	5
we	5
who	5
profess	5
the	5
austere	5
order	5
of	5
chivalry	5
are	5
liable	5
to	5
all	5
this.	5
Mount,	5
friend,	5
and	5
lead	5
the	5
way,	5
and	5
I	5
will	5
follow	5
thee	5
at	5
whatever	5
pace	5
thou	5
wilt.”	5
Sancho	5
did	5
as	5
he	5
bade	5
him,	5
and	5
proceeded	5
in	5
the	5
direction	5
in	5
which	5
he	5
thought	5
he	5
might	5
find	5
refuge	5
without	5
quitting	5
the	5
high	5
road,	5
which	5
was	5
there	5
very	5
much	5
frequented.	5
As	5
they	5
went	5
along,	5
then,	5
at	5
a	5
slow	5
pace—for	5
the	5
pain	5
in	5
Don	5
Quixote’s	5
jaws	5
kept	5
him	5
uneasy	5
and	5
ill-disposed	5
for	5
speed—Sancho	5
thought	5
it	5
well	5
to	5
amuse	5
and	5
divert	5
him	5
by	5
talk	5
of	5
some	5
kind,	5
and	5
among	5
the	5
things	5
he	5
said	5
to	5
him	5
was	5
that	5
which	5
will	5
be	5
told	5
in	5
the	5
following	5
chapter.	5

CHAPTER	5
XIX.	5
OF	5
THE	5
SHREWD	5
DISCOURSE	5
WHICH	5
SANCHO	5
HELD	5
WITH	5
HIS	5
MASTER,	5
AND	5
OF	5
THE	5
ADVENTURE	5
THAT	5
BEFELL	5
HIM	5
WITH	5
A	5
DEAD	5
BODY,	5
TOGETHER	5
WITH	5
OTHER	5
NOTABLE	5
OCCURRENCES	5
“It	5
seems	5
to	5
me,	5
señor,	5
that	5
all	5
these	5
mishaps	5
that	5
have	5
befallen	5
us	5
of	5
late	5
have	5
been	5
without	5
any	5
doubt	5
a	5
punishment	5
for	5
the	5
offence	5
committed	5
by	5
your	5
worship	5
against	5
the	5
order	5
of	5
chivalry	5
in	5
not	5
keeping	5
the	5
oath	5
you	5
made	5
not	5
to	5
eat	5
bread	5
off	5
a	5
tablecloth	5
or	5
embrace	5
the	5
queen,	5
and	5
all	5
the	5
rest	5
of	5
it	5
that	5
your	5
worship	5
swore	5
to	5
observe	5
until	5
you	5
had	5
taken	5
that	5
helmet	5
of	5
Malandrino’s,	5
or	5
whatever	5
the	5
Moor	5
is	5
called,	5
for	5
I	5
do	5
not	5
very	5
well	5
remember.”	5
“Thou	5
art	5
very	5
right,	5
Sancho,”	5
said	5
Don	5
Quixote,	5
“but	5
to	5
tell	5
the	5
truth,	5
it	5
had	5
escaped	5
my	5
memory;	5
and	5
likewise	5
thou	5
mayest	5
rely	5
upon	5
it	5
that	5
the	5
affair	5
of	5
the	5
blanket	5
happened	5
to	5
thee	5
because	5
of	5
thy	5
fault	5
in	5
not	5
reminding	5
me	5
of	5
it	5
in	5
time;	5
but	5
I	5
will	5
make	5
amends,	5
for	5
there	5
are	5
ways	5
of	5
compounding	5
for	5
everything	5
in	5
the	5
order	5
of	5
chivalry.”	5
“Why!	5
have	5
I	5
taken	5
an	5
oath	5
of	5
some	5
sort,	5
then?”	5
said	5
Sancho.	5
“It	5
makes	5
no	5
matter	5
that	5
thou	5
hast	5
not	5
taken	5
an	5
oath,”	5
said	5
Don	5
Quixote;	5
“suffice	5
it	5
that	5
I	5
see	5
thou	5
art	5
not	5
quite	5
clear	5
of	5
complicity;	5
and	5
whether	5
or	5
no,	5
it	5
will	5
not	5
be	5
ill	5
done	5
to	5
provide	5
ourselves	5
with	5
a	5
remedy.”	5
“In	5
that	5
case,”	5
said	5
Sancho,	5
“mind	5
that	5
your	5
worship	5
does	5
not	5
forget	5
this	5
as	5
you	5
did	5
the	5
oath;	5
perhaps	5
the	5
phantoms	5
may	5
take	5
it	5
into	5
their	5
heads	5
to	5
amuse	5
themselves	5
once	5
more	5
with	5
me;	5
or	5
even	5
with	5
your	5
worship	5
if	5
they	5
see	5
you	5
so	5
obstinate.”	5
While	5
engaged	5
in	5
this	5
and	5
other	5
talk,	5
night	5
overtook	5
them	5
on	5
the	5
road	5
before	5
they	5
had	5
reached	5
or	5
discovered	5
any	5
place	5
of	5
shelter;	5
and	5
what	5
made	5
it	5
still	5
worse	5
was	5
that	5
they	5
were	5
dying	5
of	5
hunger,	5
for	5
with	5
the	5
loss	5
of	5
the	5
alforjas	5
they	5
had	5
lost	5
their	5
entire	5
larder	5
and	5
commissariat;	5
and	5
to	5
complete	5
the	5
misfortune	5
they	5
met	5
with	5
an	5
adventure	5
which	5
without	5
any	5
invention	5
had	5
really	5
the	5
appearance	5
of	5
one.	5
It	5
so	5
happened	5
that	5
the	5
night	5
closed	5
in	5
somewhat	5
darkly,	5
but	5
for	5
all	5
that	5
they	5
pushed	5
on,	5
Sancho	5
feeling	5
sure	5
that	5
as	5
the	5
road	5
was	5
the	5
king’s	5
highway	5
they	5
might	5
reasonably	5
expect	5
to	5
find	5
some	5
inn	5
within	5
a	5
league	5
or	5
two.	5
Going	5
along,	5
then,	5
in	5
this	5
way,	5
the	5
night	5
dark,	5
the	5
squire	5
hungry,	5
the	5
master	5
sharp-set,	5
they	5
saw	5
coming	5
towards	5
them	5
on	5
the	5
road	5
they	5
were	5
travelling	5
a	5
great	5
number	5
of	5
lights	5
which	5
looked	5
exactly	5
like	5
stars	5
in	5
motion.	5
Sancho	5
was	5
taken	5
aback	5
at	5
the	5
sight	5
of	5
them,	5
nor	5
did	5
Don	5
Quixote	5
altogether	5
relish	5
them:	5
the	5
one	5
pulled	5
up	5
his	5
ass	5
by	5
the	5
halter,	5
the	5
other	5
his	5
hack	5
by	5
the	5
bridle,	5
and	5
they	5
stood	5
still,	5
watching	5
anxiously	5
to	5
see	5
what	5
all	5
this	5
would	5
turn	5
out	5
to	5
be,	5
and	5
found	5
that	5
the	5
lights	5
were	5
approaching	5
them,	5
and	5
the	5
nearer	5
they	5
came	5
the	5
greater	5
they	5
seemed,	5
at	5
which	5
spectacle	5
Sancho	5
began	5
to	5
shake	5
like	5
a	5
man	5
dosed	5
with	5
mercury,	5
and	5
Don	5
Quixote’s	5
hair	5
stood	5
on	5
end;	5
he,	5
however,	5
plucking	5
up	5
spirit	5
a	5
little,	5
said:	5
“This,	5
no	5
doubt,	5
Sancho,	5
will	5
be	5
a	5
most	5
mighty	5
and	5
perilous	5
adventure,	5
in	5
which	5
it	5
will	5
be	5
needful	5
for	5
me	5
to	5
put	5
forth	5
all	5
my	5
valour	5
and	5
resolution.”	5
“Unlucky	5
me!”	5
answered	5
Sancho;	5
“if	5
this	5
adventure	5
happens	5
to	5
be	5
one	5
of	5
phantoms,	5
as	5
I	5
am	5
beginning	5
to	5
think	5
it	5
is,	5
where	5
shall	5
I	5
find	5
the	5
ribs	5
to	5
bear	5
it?”	5
“Be	5
they	5
phantoms	5
ever	5
so	5
much,”	5
said	5
Don	5
Quixote,	5
“I	5
will	5
not	5
permit	5
them	5
to	5
touch	5
a	5
thread	5
of	5
thy	5
garments;	5
for	5
if	5
they	5
played	5
tricks	5
with	5
thee	5
the	5
time	5
before,	5
it	5
was	5
because	5
I	5
was	5
unable	5
to	5
leap	5
the	5
walls	5
of	5
the	5
yard;	5
but	5
now	5
we	5
are	5
on	5
a	5
wide	5
plain,	5
where	5
I	5
shall	5
be	5
able	5
to	5
wield	5
my	5
sword	5
as	5
I	5
please.”	5
“And	5
if	5
they	5
enchant	5
and	5
cripple	5
you	5
as	5
they	5
did	5
the	5
last	5
time,”	5
said	5
Sancho,	5
“what	5
difference	5
will	5
it	5
make	5
being	5
on	5
the	5
open	5
plain	5
or	5
not?”	5
“For	5
all	5
that,”	5
replied	5
Don	5
Quixote,	5
“I	5
entreat	5
thee,	5
Sancho,	5
to	5
keep	5
a	5
good	5
heart,	5
for	5
experience	5
will	5
tell	5
thee	5
what	5
mine	5
is.”	5
“I	5
will,	5
please	5
God,”	5
answered	5
Sancho,	5
and	5
the	5
two	5
retiring	5
to	5
one	5
side	5
of	5
the	5
road	5
set	5
themselves	5
to	5
observe	5
closely	5
what	5
all	5
these	5
moving	5
lights	5
might	5
be;	5
and	5
very	5
soon	5
afterwards	5
they	5
made	5
out	5
some	5
twenty	5
encamisados,	5
all	5
on	5
horseback,	5
with	5
lighted	5
torches	5
in	5
their	5
hands,	5
the	5
awe-inspiring	5
aspect	5
of	5
whom	5
completely	5
extinguished	5
the	5
courage	5
of	5
Sancho,	5
who	5
began	5
to	5
chatter	5
with	5
his	5
teeth	5
like	5
one	5
in	5
the	5
cold	5
fit	5
of	5
an	5
ague;	5
and	5
his	5
heart	5
sank	5
and	5
his	5
teeth	5
chattered	5
still	5
more	5
when	5
they	5
perceived	5
distinctly	5
that	5
behind	5
them	5
there	5
came	5
a	5
litter	5
covered	5
over	5
with	5
black	5
and	5
followed	5
by	5
six	5
more	5
mounted	5
figures	5
in	5
mourning	5
down	5
to	5
the	5
very	5
feet	5
of	5
their	5
mules—for	5
they	5
could	5
perceive	5
plainly	5
they	5
were	5
not	5
horses	5
by	5
the	5
easy	5
pace	5
at	5
which	5
they	5
went.	5
And	5
as	5
the	5
encamisados	5
came	5
along	5
they	5
muttered	5
to	5
themselves	5
in	5
a	5
low	5
plaintive	5
tone.	5
This	5
strange	5
spectacle	5
at	5
such	5
an	5
hour	5
and	5
in	5
such	5
a	5
solitary	5
place	5
was	5
quite	5
enough	5
to	5
strike	5
terror	5
into	5
Sancho’s	5
heart,	5
and	5
even	5
into	5
his	5
master’s;	5
and	5
(save	5
in	5
Don	5
Quixote’s	5
case)	5
did	5
so,	5
for	5
all	5
Sancho’s	5
resolution	5
had	5
now	5
broken	5
down.	5
It	5
was	5
just	5
the	5
opposite	5
with	5
his	5
master,	5
whose	5
imagination	5
immediately	5
conjured	5
up	5
all	5
this	5
to	5
him	5
vividly	5
as	5
one	5
of	5
the	5
adventures	5
of	5
his	5
books.	5
He	5
took	5
it	5
into	5
his	5
head	5
that	5
the	5
litter	5
was	5
a	5
bier	5
on	5
which	5
was	5
borne	5
some	5
sorely	5
wounded	5
or	5
slain	5
knight,	5
to	5
avenge	5
whom	5
was	5
a	5
task	5
reserved	5
for	5
him	5
alone;	5
and	5
without	5
any	5
further	5
reasoning	5
he	5
laid	5
his	5
lance	5
in	5
rest,	5
fixed	5
himself	5
firmly	5
in	5
his	5
saddle,	5
and	5
with	5
gallant	5
spirit	5
and	5
bearing	5
took	5
up	5
his	5
position	5
in	5
the	5
middle	5
of	5
the	5
road	5
where	5
the	5
encamisados	5
must	5
of	5
necessity	5
pass;	5
and	5
as	5
soon	5
as	5
he	5
saw	5
them	5
near	5
at	5
hand	5
he	5
raised	5
his	5
voice	5
and	5
said:	5
“Halt,	5
knights,	5
or	5
whosoever	5
ye	5
may	5
be,	5
and	5
render	5
me	5
account	5
of	5
who	5
ye	5
are,	5
whence	5
ye	5
come,	5
where	5
ye	5
go,	5
what	5
it	5
is	5
ye	5
carry	5
upon	5
that	5
bier,	5
for,	5
to	5
judge	5
by	5
appearances,	5
either	5
ye	5
have	5
done	5
some	5
wrong	5
or	5
some	5
wrong	5
has	5
been	5
done	5
to	5
you,	5
and	5
it	5
is	5
fitting	5
and	5
necessary	5
that	5
I	5
should	5
know,	5
either	5
that	5
I	5
may	5
chastise	5
you	5
for	5
the	5
evil	5
ye	5
have	5
done,	5
or	5
else	5
that	5
I	5
may	5
avenge	5
you	5
for	5
the	5
injury	5
that	5
has	5
been	5
inflicted	5
upon	5
you.”	5
“We	5
are	5
in	5
haste,”	5
answered	5
one	5
of	5
the	5
encamisados,	5
“and	5
the	5
inn	5
is	5
far	5
off,	5
and	5
we	5
cannot	5
stop	5
to	5
render	5
you	5
such	5
an	5
account	5
as	5
you	5
demand;”	5
and	5
spurring	5
his	5
mule	5
he	5
moved	5
on.	5
Don	5
Quixote	5
was	5
mightily	5
provoked	5
by	5
this	5
answer,	5
and	5
seizing	5
the	5
mule	5
by	5
the	5
bridle	5
he	5
said,	5
“Halt,	5
and	5
be	5
more	5
mannerly,	5
and	5
render	5
an	5
account	5
of	5
what	5
I	5
have	5
asked	5
of	5
you;	5
else,	5
take	5
my	5
defiance	5
to	5
combat,	5
all	5
of	5
you.”	5
The	5
mule	5
was	5
shy,	5
and	5
was	5
so	5
frightened	5
at	5
her	5
bridle	5
being	5
seized	5
that	5
rearing	5
up	5
she	5
flung	5
her	5
rider	5
to	5
the	5
ground	5
over	5
her	5
haunches.	5
An	5
attendant	5
who	5
was	5
on	5
foot,	5
seeing	5
the	5
encamisado	5
fall,	5
began	5
to	5
abuse	5
Don	5
Quixote,	5
who	5
now	5
moved	5
to	5
anger,	5
without	5
any	5
more	5
ado,	5
laying	5
his	5
lance	5
in	5
rest	5
charged	5
one	5
of	5
the	5
men	5
in	5
mourning	5
and	5
brought	5
him	5
badly	5
wounded	5
to	5
the	5
ground,	5
and	5
as	5
he	5
wheeled	5
round	5
upon	5
the	5
others	5
the	5
agility	5
with	5
which	5
he	5
attacked	5
and	5
routed	5
them	5
was	5
a	5
sight	5
to	5
see,	5
for	5
it	5
seemed	5
just	5
as	5
if	5
wings	5
had	5
that	5
instant	5
grown	5
upon	5
Rocinante,	5
so	5
lightly	5
and	5
proudly	5
did	5
he	5
bear	5
himself.	5
The	5
encamisados	5
were	5
all	5
timid	5
folk	5
and	5
unarmed,	5
so	5
they	5
speedily	5
made	5
their	5
escape	5
from	5
the	5
fray	5
and	5
set	5
off	5
at	5
a	5
run	5
across	5
the	5
plain	5
with	5
their	5
lighted	5
torches,	5
looking	5
exactly	5
like	5
maskers	5
running	5
on	5
some	5
gala	5
or	5
festival	5
night.	5
The	5
mourners,	5
too,	5
enveloped	5
and	5
swathed	5
in	5
their	5
skirts	5
and	5
gowns,	5
were	5
unable	5
to	5
bestir	5
themselves,	5
and	5
so	5
with	5
entire	5
safety	5
to	5
himself	5
Don	5
Quixote	5
belaboured	5
them	5
all	5
and	5
drove	5
them	5
off	5
against	5
their	5
will,	5
for	5
they	5
all	5
thought	5
it	5
was	5
no	5
man	5
but	5
a	5
devil	5
from	5
hell	5
come	5
to	5
carry	5
away	5
the	5
dead	5
body	5
they	5
had	5
in	5
the	5
litter.	5
Sancho	5
beheld	5
all	5
this	5
in	5
astonishment	5
at	5
the	5
intrepidity	5
of	5
his	5
lord,	5
and	5
said	5
to	5
himself,	5
“Clearly	5
this	5
master	5
of	5
mine	5
is	5
as	5
bold	5
and	5
valiant	5
as	5
he	5
says	5
he	5
is.”	5
A	5
burning	5
torch	5
lay	5
on	5
the	5
ground	5
near	5
the	5
first	5
man	5
whom	5
the	5
mule	5
had	5
thrown,	5
by	5
the	5
light	5
of	5
which	5
Don	5
Quixote	5
perceived	5
him,	5
and	5
coming	5
up	5
to	5
him	5
he	5
presented	5
the	5
point	5
of	5
the	5
lance	5
to	5
his	5
face,	5
calling	5
on	5
him	5
to	5
yield	5
himself	5
prisoner,	5
or	5
else	5
he	5
would	5
kill	5
him;	5
to	5
which	5
the	5
prostrate	5
man	5
replied,	5
“I	5
am	5
prisoner	5
enough	5
as	5
it	5
is;	5
I	5
cannot	5
stir,	5
for	5
one	5
of	5
my	5
legs	5
is	5
broken:	5
I	5
entreat	5
you,	5
if	5
you	5
be	5
a	5
Christian	5
gentleman,	5
not	5
to	5
kill	5
me,	5
which	5
will	5
be	5
committing	5
grave	5
sacrilege,	5
for	5
I	5
am	5
a	5
licentiate	5
and	5
I	5
hold	5
first	5
orders.”	5
“Then	5
what	5
the	5
devil	5
brought	5
you	5
here,	5
being	5
a	5
churchman?”	5
said	5
Don	5
Quixote.	5
“What,	5
señor?”	5
said	5
the	5
other.	5
“My	5
bad	5
luck.”	5
“Then	5
still	5
worse	5
awaits	5
you,”	5
said	5
Don	5
Quixote,	5
“if	5
you	5
do	5
not	5
satisfy	5
me	5
as	5
to	5
all	5
I	5
asked	5
you	5
at	5
first.”	5
“You	5
shall	5
be	5
soon	5
satisfied,”	5
said	5
the	5
licentiate;	5
“you	5
must	5
know,	5
then,	5
that	5
though	5
just	5
now	5
I	5
said	5
I	5
was	5
a	5
licentiate,	5
I	5
am	5
only	5
a	5
bachelor,	5
and	5
my	5
name	5
is	5
Alonzo	5
Lopez;	5
I	5
am	5
a	5
native	5
of	5
Alcobendas,	5
I	5
come	5
from	5
the	5
city	5
of	5
Baeza	5
with	5
eleven	5
others,	5
priests,	5
the	5
same	5
who	5
fled	5
with	5
the	5
torches,	5
and	5
we	5
are	5
going	5
to	5
the	5
city	5
of	5
Segovia	5
accompanying	5
a	5
dead	5
body	5
which	5
is	5
in	5
that	5
litter,	5
and	5
is	5
that	5
of	5
a	5
gentleman	5
who	5
died	5
in	5
Baeza,	5
where	5
he	5
was	5
interred;	5
and	5
now,	5
as	5
I	5
said,	5
we	5
are	5
taking	5
his	5
bones	5
to	5
their	5
burial-place,	5
which	5
is	5
in	5
Segovia,	5
where	5
he	5
was	5
born.”	5
“And	5
who	5
killed	5
him?”	5
asked	5
Don	5
Quixote.	5
“God,	5
by	5
means	5
of	5
a	5
malignant	5
fever	5
that	5
took	5
him,”	5
answered	5
the	5
bachelor.	5
“In	5
that	5
case,”	5
said	5
Don	5
Quixote,	5
“the	5
Lord	5
has	5
relieved	5
me	5
of	5
the	5
task	5
of	5
avenging	5
his	5
death	5
had	5
any	5
other	5
slain	5
him;	5
but,	5
he	5
who	5
slew	5
him	5
having	5
slain	5
him,	5
there	5
is	5
nothing	5
for	5
it	5
but	5
to	5
be	5
silent,	5
and	5
shrug	5
one’s	5
shoulders;	5
I	5
should	5
do	5
the	5
same	5
were	5
he	5
to	5
slay	5
myself;	5
and	5
I	5
would	5
have	5
your	5
reverence	5
know	5
that	5
I	5
am	5
a	5
knight	5
of	5
La	5
Mancha,	5
Don	5
Quixote	5
by	5
name,	5
and	5
it	5
is	5
my	5
business	5
and	5
calling	5
to	5
roam	5
the	5
world	5
righting	5
wrongs	5
and	5
redressing	5
injuries.”	5
“I	5
do	5
not	5
know	5
how	5
that	5
about	5
righting	5
wrongs	5
can	5
be,”	5
said	5
the	5
bachelor,	5
“for	5
from	5
straight	5
you	5
have	5
made	5
me	5
crooked,	5
leaving	5
me	5
with	5
a	5
broken	5
leg	5
that	5
will	5
never	5
see	5
itself	5
straight	5
again	5
all	5
the	5
days	5
of	5
its	5
life;	5
and	5
the	5
injury	5
you	5
have	5
redressed	5
in	5
my	5
case	5
has	5
been	5
to	5
leave	5
me	5
injured	5
in	5
such	5
a	5
way	5
that	5
I	5
shall	5
remain	5
injured	5
for	5
ever;	5
and	5
the	5
height	5
of	5
misadventure	5
it	5
was	5
to	5
fall	5
in	5
with	5
you	5
who	5
go	5
in	5
search	5
of	5
adventures.”	5
“Things	5
do	5
not	5
all	5
happen	5
in	5
the	5
same	5
way,”	5
answered	5
Don	5
Quixote;	5
“it	5
all	5
came,	5
Sir	5
Bachelor	5
Alonzo	5
Lopez,	5
of	5
your	5
going,	5
as	5
you	5
did,	5
by	5
night,	5
dressed	5
in	5
those	5
surplices,	5
with	5
lighted	5
torches,	5
praying,	5
covered	5
with	5
mourning,	5
so	5
that	5
naturally	5
you	5
looked	5
like	5
something	5
evil	5
and	5
of	5
the	5
other	5
world;	5
and	5
so	5
I	5
could	5
not	5
avoid	5
doing	5
my	5
duty	5
in	5
attacking	5
you,	5
and	5
I	5
should	5
have	5
attacked	5
you	5
even	5
had	5
I	5
known	5
positively	5
that	5
you	5
were	5
the	5
very	5
devils	5
of	5
hell,	5
for	5
such	5
I	5
certainly	5
believed	5
and	5
took	5
you	5
to	5
be.”	5
“As	5
my	5
fate	5
has	5
so	5
willed	5
it,”	5
said	5
the	5
bachelor,	5
“I	5
entreat	5
you,	5
sir	5
knight-errant,	5
whose	5
errand	5
has	5
been	5
such	5
an	5
evil	5
one	5
for	5
me,	5
to	5
help	5
me	5
to	5
get	5
from	5
under	5
this	5
mule	5
that	5
holds	5
one	5
of	5
my	5
legs	5
caught	5
between	5
the	5
stirrup	5
and	5
the	5
saddle.”	5
“I	5
would	5
have	5
talked	5
on	5
till	5
to-morrow,”	5
said	5
Don	5
Quixote;	5
“how	5
long	5
were	5
you	5
going	5
to	5
wait	5
before	5
telling	5
me	5
of	5
your	5
distress?”	5
He	5
at	5
once	5
called	5
to	5
Sancho,	5
who,	5
however,	5
had	5
no	5
mind	5
to	5
come,	5
as	5
he	5
was	5
just	5
then	5
engaged	5
in	5
unloading	5
a	5
sumpter	5
mule,	5
well	5
laden	5
with	5
provender,	5
which	5
these	5
worthy	5
gentlemen	5
had	5
brought	5
with	5
them.	5
Sancho	5
made	5
a	5
bag	5
of	5
his	5
coat,	5
and,	5
getting	5
together	5
as	5
much	5
as	5
he	5
could,	5
and	5
as	5
the	5
bag	5
would	5
hold,	5
he	5
loaded	5
his	5
beast,	5
and	5
then	5
hastened	5
to	5
obey	5
his	5
master’s	5
call,	5
and	5
helped	5
him	5
to	5
remove	5
the	5
bachelor	5
from	5
under	5
the	5
mule;	5
then	5
putting	5
him	5
on	5
her	5
back	5
he	5
gave	5
him	5
the	5
torch,	5
and	5
Don	5
Quixote	5
bade	5
him	5
follow	5
the	5
track	5
of	5
his	5
companions,	5
and	5
beg	5
pardon	5
of	5
them	5
on	5
his	5
part	5
for	5
the	5
wrong	5
which	5
he	5
could	5
not	5
help	5
doing	5
them.	5
And	5
said	5
Sancho,	5
“If	5
by	5
chance	5
these	5
gentlemen	5
should	5
want	5
to	5
know	5
who	5
was	5
the	5
hero	5
that	5
served	5
them	5
so,	5
your	5
worship	5
may	5
tell	5
them	5
that	5
he	5
is	5
the	5
famous	5
Don	5
Quixote	5
of	5
La	5
Mancha,	5
otherwise	5
called	5
the	5
Knight	5
of	5
the	5
Rueful	5
Countenance.”	5
The	5
bachelor	5
then	5
took	5
his	5
departure.	5
I	5
forgot	5
to	5
mention	5
that	5
before	5
he	5
did	5
so	5
he	5
said	5
to	5
Don	5
Quixote,	5
“Remember	5
that	5
you	5
stand	5
excommunicated	5
for	5
having	5
laid	5
violent	5
hands	5
on	5
a	5
holy	5
thing,	5
_juxta	5
illud,	5
si	5
quis,	5
suadente	5
diabolo_.”	5
“I	5
do	5
not	5
understand	5
that	5
Latin,”	5
answered	5
Don	5
Quixote,	5
“but	5
I	5
know	5
well	5
I	5
did	5
not	5
lay	5
hands,	5
only	5
this	5
pike;	5
besides,	5
I	5
did	5
not	5
think	5
I	5
was	5
committing	5
an	5
assault	5
upon	5
priests	5
or	5
things	5
of	5
the	5
Church,	5
which,	5
like	5
a	5
Catholic	5
and	5
faithful	5
Christian	5
as	5
I	5
am,	5
I	5
respect	5
and	5
revere,	5
but	5
upon	5
phantoms	5
and	5
spectres	5
of	5
the	5
other	5
world;	5
but	5
even	5
so,	5
I	5
remember	5
how	5
it	5
fared	5
with	5
Cid	5
Ruy	5
Diaz	5
when	5
he	5
broke	5
the	5
chair	5
of	5
the	5
ambassador	5
of	5
that	5
king	5
before	5
his	5
Holiness	5
the	5
Pope,	5
who	5
excommunicated	5
him	5
for	5
the	5
same;	5
and	5
yet	5
the	5
good	5
Roderick	5
of	5
Vivar	5
bore	5
himself	5
that	5
day	5
like	5
a	5
very	5
noble	5
and	5
valiant	5
knight.”	5
On	5
hearing	5
this	5
the	5
bachelor	5
took	5
his	5
departure,	5
as	5
has	5
been	5
said,	5
without	5
making	5
any	5
reply;	5
and	5
Don	5
Quixote	5
asked	5
Sancho	5
what	5
had	5
induced	5
him	5
to	5
call	5
him	5
the	5
“Knight	5
of	5
the	5
Rueful	5
Countenance”	5
more	5
then	5
than	5
at	5
any	5
other	5
time.	5
“I	5
will	5
tell	5
you,”	5
answered	5
Sancho;	5
“it	5
was	5
because	5
I	5
have	5
been	5
looking	5
at	5
you	5
for	5
some	5
time	5
by	5
the	5
light	5
of	5
the	5
torch	5
held	5
by	5
that	5
unfortunate,	5
and	5
verily	5
your	5
worship	5
has	5
got	5
of	5
late	5
the	5
most	5
ill-favoured	5
countenance	5
I	5
ever	5
saw:	5
it	5
must	5
be	5
either	5
owing	5
to	5
the	5
fatigue	5
of	5
this	5
combat,	5
or	5
else	5
to	5
the	5
want	5
of	5
teeth	5
and	5
grinders.”	5
“It	5
is	5
not	5
that,”	5
replied	5
Don	5
Quixote,	5
“but	5
because	5
the	5
sage	5
whose	5
duty	5
it	5
will	5
be	5
to	5
write	5
the	5
history	5
of	5
my	5
achievements	5
must	5
have	5
thought	5
it	5
proper	5
that	5
I	5
should	5
take	5
some	5
distinctive	5
name	5
as	5
all	5
knights	5
of	5
yore	5
did;	5
one	5
being	5
‘He	5
of	5
the	5
Burning	5
Sword,’	5
another	5
‘He	5
of	5
the	5
Unicorn,’	5
this	5
one	5
‘He	5
of	5
the	5
Damsels,’	5
that	5
‘He	5
of	5
the	5
Phœnix,’	5
another	5
‘The	5
Knight	5
of	5
the	5
Griffin,’	5
and	5
another	5
‘He	5
of	5
the	5
Death,’	5
and	5
by	5
these	5
names	5
and	5
designations	5
they	5
were	5
known	5
all	5
the	5
world	5
round;	5
and	5
so	5
I	5
say	5
that	5
the	5
sage	5
aforesaid	5
must	5
have	5
put	5
it	5
into	5
your	5
mouth	5
and	5
mind	5
just	5
now	5
to	5
call	5
me	5
‘The	5
Knight	5
of	5
the	5
Rueful	5
Countenance,’	5
as	5
I	5
intend	5
to	5
call	5
myself	5
from	5
this	5
day	5
forward;	5
and	5
that	5
the	5
said	5
name	5
may	5
fit	5
me	5
better,	5
I	5
mean,	5
when	5
the	5
opportunity	5
offers,	5
to	5
have	5
a	5
very	5
rueful	5
countenance	5
painted	5
on	5
my	5
shield.”	5
“There	5
is	5
no	5
occasion,	5
señor,	5
for	5
wasting	5
time	5
or	5
money	5
on	5
making	5
that	5
countenance,”	5
said	5
Sancho;	5
“for	5
all	5
that	5
need	5
be	5
done	5
is	5
for	5
your	5
worship	5
to	5
show	5
your	5
own,	5
face	5
to	5
face,	5
to	5
those	5
who	5
look	5
at	5
you,	5
and	5
without	5
anything	5
more,	5
either	5
image	5
or	5
shield,	5
they	5
will	5
call	5
you	5
‘Him	5
of	5
the	5
Rueful	5
Countenance’	5
and	5
believe	5
me	5
I	5
am	5
telling	5
you	5
the	5
truth,	5
for	5
I	5
assure	5
you,	5
señor	5
(and	5
in	5
good	5
part	5
be	5
it	5
said),	5
hunger	5
and	5
the	5
loss	5
of	5
your	5
grinders	5
have	5
given	5
you	5
such	5
an	5
ill-favoured	5
face	5
that,	5
as	5
I	5
say,	5
the	5
rueful	5
picture	5
may	5
be	5
very	5
well	5
spared.”	5
Don	5
Quixote	5
laughed	5
at	5
Sancho’s	5
pleasantry;	5
nevertheless	5
he	5
resolved	5
to	5
call	5
himself	5
by	5
that	5
name,	5
and	5
have	5
his	5
shield	5
or	5
buckler	5
painted	5
as	5
he	5
had	5
devised.	5
Don	5
Quixote	5
would	5
have	5
looked	5
to	5
see	5
whether	5
the	5
body	5
in	5
the	5
litter	5
were	5
bones	5
or	5
not,	5
but	5
Sancho	5
would	5
not	5
have	5
it,	5
saying:	5
“Señor,	5
you	5
have	5
ended	5
this	5
perilous	5
adventure	5
more	5
safely	5
for	5
yourself	5
than	5
any	5
of	5
those	5
I	5
have	5
seen:	5
perhaps	5
these	5
people,	5
though	5
beaten	5
and	5
routed,	5
may	5
bethink	5
themselves	5
that	5
it	5
is	5
a	5
single	5
man	5
that	5
has	5
beaten	5
them,	5
and	5
feeling	5
sore	5
and	5
ashamed	5
of	5
it	5
may	5
take	5
heart	5
and	5
come	5
in	5
search	5
of	5
us	5
and	5
give	5
us	5
trouble	5
enough.	5
The	5
ass	5
is	5
in	5
proper	5
trim,	5
the	5
mountains	5
are	5
near	5
at	5
hand,	5
hunger	5
presses,	5
we	5
have	5
nothing	5
more	5
to	5
do	5
but	5
make	5
good	5
our	5
retreat,	5
and,	5
as	5
the	5
saying	5
is,	5
the	5
dead	5
to	5
the	5
grave	5
and	5
the	5
living	5
to	5
the	5
loaf.”	5
And	5
driving	5
his	5
ass	5
before	5
him	5
he	5
begged	5
his	5
master	5
to	5
follow,	5
who,	5
feeling	5
that	5
Sancho	5
was	5
right,	5
did	5
so	5
without	5
replying;	5
and	5
after	5
proceeding	5
some	5
little	5
distance	5
between	5
two	5
hills	5
they	5
found	5
themselves	5
in	5
a	5
wide	5
and	5
retired	5
valley,	5
where	5
they	5
alighted,	5
and	5
Sancho	5
unloaded	5
his	5
beast,	5
and	5
stretched	5
upon	5
the	5
green	5
grass,	5
with	5
hunger	5
for	5
sauce,	5
they	5
breakfasted,	5
dined,	5
lunched,	5
and	5
supped	5
all	5
at	5
once,	5
satisfying	5
their	5
appetites	5
with	5
more	5
than	5
one	5
store	5
of	5
cold	5
meat	5
which	5
the	5
dead	5
man’s	5
clerical	5
gentlemen	5
(who	5
seldom	5
put	5
themselves	5
on	5
short	5
allowance)	5
had	5
brought	5
with	5
them	5
on	5
their	5
sumpter	5
mule.	5
But	5
another	5
piece	5
of	5
ill-luck	5
befell	5
them,	5
which	5
Sancho	5
held	5
the	5
worst	5
of	5
all,	5
and	5
that	5
was	5
that	5
they	5
had	5
no	5
wine	5
to	5
drink,	5
nor	5
even	5
water	5
to	5
moisten	5
their	5
lips;	5
and	5
as	5
thirst	5
tormented	5
them,	5
Sancho,	5
observing	5
that	5
the	5
meadow	5
where	5
they	5
were	5
was	5
full	5
of	5
green	5
and	5
tender	5
grass,	5
said	5
what	5
will	5
be	5
told	5
in	5
the	5
following	5
chapter.	5

“It	5
cannot	5
be,	5
señor,	5
but	5
that	5
this	5
grass	5
is	5
a	5
proof	5
that	5
there	5
must	5
be	5
hard	5
by	5
some	5
spring	5
or	5
brook	5
to	5
give	5
it	5
moisture,	5
so	5
it	5
would	5
be	5
well	5
to	5
move	5
a	5
little	5
farther	5
on,	5
that	5
we	5
may	5
find	5
some	5
place	5
where	5
we	5
may	5
quench	5
this	5
terrible	5
thirst	5
that	5
plagues	5
us,	5
which	5
beyond	5
a	5
doubt	5
is	5
more	5
distressing	5
than	5
hunger.”	5
The	5
advice	5
seemed	5
good	5
to	5
Don	5
Quixote,	5
and,	5
he	5
leading	5
Rocinante	5
by	5
the	5
bridle	5
and	5
Sancho	5
the	5
ass	5
by	5
the	5
halter,	5
after	5
he	5
had	5
packed	5
away	5
upon	5
him	5
the	5
remains	5
of	5
the	5
supper,	5
they	5
advanced	5
the	5
meadow	5
feeling	5
their	5
way,	5
for	5
the	5
darkness	5
of	5
the	5
night	5
made	5
it	5
impossible	5
to	5
see	5
anything;	5
but	5
they	5
had	5
not	5
gone	5
two	5
hundred	5
paces	5
when	5
a	5
loud	5
noise	5
of	5
water,	5
as	5
if	5
falling	5
from	5
great	5
rocks,	5
struck	5
their	5
ears.	5
The	5
sound	5
cheered	5
them	5
greatly;	5
but	5
halting	5
to	5
make	5
out	5
by	5
listening	5
from	5
what	5
quarter	5
it	5
came	5
they	5
heard	5
unseasonably	5
another	5
noise	5
which	5
spoiled	5
the	5
satisfaction	5
the	5
sound	5
of	5
the	5
water	5
gave	5
them,	5
especially	5
for	5
Sancho,	5
who	5
was	5
by	5
nature	5
timid	5
and	5
faint-hearted.	5
They	5
heard,	5
I	5
say,	5
strokes	5
falling	5
with	5
a	5
measured	5
beat,	5
and	5
a	5
certain	5
rattling	5
of	5
iron	5
and	5
chains	5
that,	5
together	5
with	5
the	5
furious	5
din	5
of	5
the	5
water,	5
would	5
have	5
struck	5
terror	5
into	5
any	5
heart	5
but	5
Don	5
Quixote’s.	5
The	5
night	5
was,	5
as	5
has	5
been	5
said,	5
dark,	5
and	5
they	5
had	5
happened	5
to	5
reach	5
a	5
spot	5
in	5
among	5
some	5
tall	5
trees,	5
whose	5
leaves	5
stirred	5
by	5
a	5
gentle	5
breeze	5
made	5
a	5
low	5
ominous	5
sound;	5
so	5
that,	5
what	5
with	5
the	5
solitude,	5
the	5
place,	5
the	5
darkness,	5
the	5
noise	5
of	5
the	5
water,	5
and	5
the	5
rustling	5
of	5
the	5
leaves,	5
everything	5
inspired	5
awe	5
and	5
dread;	5
more	5
especially	5
as	5
they	5
perceived	5
that	5
the	5
strokes	5
did	5
not	5
cease,	5
nor	5
the	5
wind	5
lull,	5
nor	5
morning	5
approach;	5
to	5
all	5
which	5
might	5
be	5
added	5
their	5
ignorance	5
as	5
to	5
where	5
they	5
were.	5

But	5
Don	5
Quixote,	5
supported	5
by	5
his	5
intrepid	5
heart,	5
leaped	5
on	5
Rocinante,	5
and	5
bracing	5
his	5
buckler	5
on	5
his	5
arm,	5
brought	5
his	5
pike	5
to	5
the	5
slope,	5
and	5
said,	5
“Friend	5
Sancho,	5
know	5
that	5
I	5
by	5
Heaven’s	5
will	5
have	5
been	5
born	5
in	5
this	5
our	5
iron	5
age	5
to	5
revive	5
in	5
it	5
the	5
age	5
of	5
gold,	5
or	5
the	5
golden	5
as	5
it	5
is	5
called;	5
I	5
am	5
he	5
for	5
whom	5
perils,	5
mighty	5
achievements,	5
and	5
valiant	5
deeds	5
are	5
reserved;	5
I	5
am,	5
I	5
say	5
again,	5
he	5
who	5
is	5
to	5
revive	5
the	5
Knights	5
of	5
the	5
Round	5
Table,	5
the	5
Twelve	5
of	5
France	5
and	5
the	5
Nine	5
Worthies;	5
and	5
he	5
who	5
is	5
to	5
consign	5
to	5
oblivion	5
the	5
Platirs,	5
the	5
Tablantes,	5
the	5
Olivantes	5
and	5
Tirantes,	5
the	5
Phœbuses	5
and	5
Belianises,	5
with	5
the	5
whole	5
herd	5
of	5
famous	5
knights-errant	5
of	5
days	5
gone	5
by,	5
performing	5
in	5
these	5
in	5
which	5
I	5
live	5
such	5
exploits,	5
marvels,	5
and	5
feats	5
of	5
arms	5
as	5
shall	5
obscure	5
their	5
brightest	5
deeds.	5
Thou	5
dost	5
mark	5
well,	5
faithful	5
and	5
trusty	5
squire,	5
the	5
gloom	5
of	5
this	5
night,	5
its	5
strange	5
silence,	5
the	5
dull	5
confused	5
murmur	5
of	5
those	5
trees,	5
the	5
awful	5
sound	5
of	5
that	5
water	5
in	5
quest	5
of	5
which	5
we	5
came,	5
that	5
seems	5
as	5
though	5
it	5
were	5
precipitating	5
and	5
dashing	5
itself	5
down	5
from	5
the	5
lofty	5
mountains	5
of	5
the	5
Moon,	5
and	5
that	5
incessant	5
hammering	5
that	5
wounds	5
and	5
pains	5
our	5
ears;	5
which	5
things	5
all	5
together	5
and	5
each	5
of	5
itself	5
are	5
enough	5
to	5
instil	5
fear,	5
dread,	5
and	5
dismay	5
into	5
the	5
breast	5
of	5
Mars	5
himself,	5
much	5
more	5
into	5
one	5
not	5
used	5
to	5
hazards	5
and	5
adventures	5
of	5
the	5
kind.	5
Well,	5
then,	5
all	5
this	5
that	5
I	5
put	5
before	5
thee	5
is	5
but	5
an	5
incentive	5
and	5
stimulant	5
to	5
my	5
spirit,	5
making	5
my	5
heart	5
burst	5
in	5
my	5
bosom	5
through	5
eagerness	5
to	5
engage	5
in	5
this	5
adventure,	5
arduous	5
as	5
it	5
promises	5
to	5
be;	5
therefore	5
tighten	5
Rocinante’s	5
girths	5
a	5
little,	5
and	5
God	5
be	5
with	5
thee;	5
wait	5
for	5
me	5
here	5
three	5
days	5
and	5
no	5
more,	5
and	5
if	5
in	5
that	5
time	5
I	5
come	5
not	5
back,	5
thou	5
canst	5
return	5
to	5
our	5
village,	5
and	5
thence,	5
to	5
do	5
me	5
a	5
favour	5
and	5
a	5
service,	5
thou	5
wilt	5
go	5
to	5
El	5
Toboso,	5
where	5
thou	5
shalt	5
say	5
to	5
my	5
incomparable	5
lady	5
Dulcinea	5
that	5
her	5
captive	5
knight	5
hath	5
died	5
in	5
attempting	5
things	5
that	5
might	5
make	5
him	5
worthy	5
of	5
being	5
called	5
hers.”	5
When	5
Sancho	5
heard	5
his	5
master’s	5
words	5
he	5
began	5
to	5
weep	5
in	5
the	5
most	5
pathetic	5
way,	5
saying:	5
“Señor,	5
I	5
know	5
not	5
why	5
your	5
worship	5
wants	5
to	5
attempt	5
this	5
so	5
dreadful	5
adventure;	5
it	5
is	5
night	5
now,	5
no	5
one	5
sees	5
us	5
here,	5
we	5
can	5
easily	5
turn	5
about	5
and	5
take	5
ourselves	5
out	5
of	5
danger,	5
even	5
if	5
we	5
don’t	5
drink	5
for	5
three	5
days	5
to	5
come;	5
and	5
as	5
there	5
is	5
no	5
one	5
to	5
see	5
us,	5
all	5
the	5
less	5
will	5
there	5
be	5
anyone	5
to	5
set	5
us	5
down	5
as	5
cowards;	5
besides,	5
I	5
have	5
many	5
a	5
time	5
heard	5
the	5
curate	5
of	5
our	5
village,	5
whom	5
your	5
worship	5
knows	5
well,	5
preach	5
that	5
he	5
who	5
seeks	5
danger	5
perishes	5
in	5
it;	5
so	5
it	5
is	5
not	5
right	5
to	5
tempt	5
God	5
by	5
trying	5
so	5
tremendous	5
a	5
feat	5
from	5
which	5
there	5
can	5
be	5
no	5
escape	5
save	5
by	5
a	5
miracle,	5
and	5
Heaven	5
has	5
performed	5
enough	5
of	5
them	5
for	5
your	5
worship	5
in	5
delivering	5
you	5
from	5
being	5
blanketed	5
as	5
I	5
was,	5
and	5
bringing	5
you	5
out	5
victorious	5
and	5
safe	5
and	5
sound	5
from	5
among	5
all	5
those	5
enemies	5
that	5
were	5
with	5
the	5
dead	5
man;	5
and	5
if	5
all	5
this	5
does	5
not	5
move	5
or	5
soften	5
that	5
hard	5
heart,	5
let	5
this	5
thought	5
and	5
reflection	5
move	5
it,	5
that	5
you	5
will	5
have	5
hardly	5
quitted	5
this	5
spot	5
when	5
from	5
pure	5
fear	5
I	5
shall	5
yield	5
my	5
soul	5
up	5
to	5
anyone	5
that	5
will	5
take	5
it.	5
I	5
left	5
home	5
and	5
wife	5
and	5
children	5
to	5
come	5
and	5
serve	5
your	5
worship,	5
trusting	5
to	5
do	5
better	5
and	5
not	5
worse;	5
but	5
as	5
covetousness	5
bursts	5
the	5
bag,	5
it	5
has	5
rent	5
my	5
hopes	5
asunder,	5
for	5
just	5
as	5
I	5
had	5
them	5
highest	5
about	5
getting	5
that	5
wretched	5
unlucky	5
island	5
your	5
worship	5
has	5
so	5
often	5
promised	5
me,	5
I	5
see	5
that	5
instead	5
and	5
in	5
lieu	5
of	5
it	5
you	5
mean	5
to	5
desert	5
me	5
now	5
in	5
a	5
place	5
so	5
far	5
from	5
human	5
reach:	5
for	5
God’s	5
sake,	5
master	5
mine,	5
deal	5
not	5
so	5
unjustly	5
by	5
me,	5
and	5
if	5
your	5
worship	5
will	5
not	5
entirely	5
give	5
up	5
attempting	5
this	5
feat,	5
at	5
least	5
put	5
it	5
off	5
till	5
morning,	5
for	5
by	5
what	5
the	5
lore	5
I	5
learned	5
when	5
I	5
was	5
a	5
shepherd	5
tells	5
me	5
it	5
cannot	5
want	5
three	5
hours	5
of	5
dawn	5
now,	5
because	5
the	5
mouth	5
of	5
the	5
Horn	5
is	5
overhead	5
and	5
makes	5
midnight	5
in	5
the	5
line	5
of	5
the	5
left	5
arm.”	5
“How	5
canst	5
thou	5
see,	5
Sancho,”	5
said	5
Don	5
Quixote,	5
“where	5
it	5
makes	5
that	5
line,	5
or	5
where	5
this	5
mouth	5
or	5
this	5
occiput	5
is	5
that	5
thou	5
talkest	5
of,	5
when	5
the	5
night	5
is	5
so	5
dark	5
that	5
there	5
is	5
not	5
a	5
star	5
to	5
be	5
seen	5
in	5
the	5
whole	5
heaven?”	5
“That’s	5
true,”	5
said	5
Sancho,	5
“but	5
fear	5
has	5
sharp	5
eyes,	5
and	5
sees	5
things	5
underground,	5
much	5
more	5
above	5
in	5
heavens;	5
besides,	5
there	5
is	5
good	5
reason	5
to	5
show	5
that	5
it	5
now	5
wants	5
but	5
little	5
of	5
day.”	5
“Let	5
it	5
want	5
what	5
it	5
may,”	5
replied	5
Don	5
Quixote,	5
“it	5
shall	5
not	5
be	5
said	5
of	5
me	5
now	5
or	5
at	5
any	5
time	5
that	5
tears	5
or	5
entreaties	5
turned	5
me	5
aside	5
from	5
doing	5
what	5
was	5
in	5
accordance	5
with	5
knightly	5
usage;	5
and	5
so	5
I	5
beg	5
of	5
thee,	5
Sancho,	5
to	5
hold	5
thy	5
peace,	5
for	5
God,	5
who	5
has	5
put	5
it	5
into	5
my	5
heart	5
to	5
undertake	5
now	5
this	5
so	5
unexampled	5
and	5
terrible	5
adventure,	5
will	5
take	5
care	5
to	5
watch	5
over	5
my	5
safety	5
and	5
console	5
thy	5
sorrow;	5
what	5
thou	5
hast	5
to	5
do	5
is	5
to	5
tighten	5
Rocinante’s	5
girths	5
well,	5
and	5
wait	5
here,	5
for	5
I	5
shall	5
come	5
back	5
shortly,	5
alive	5
or	5
dead.”	5
Sancho	5
perceiving	5
it	5
his	5
master’s	5
final	5
resolve,	5
and	5
how	5
little	5
his	5
tears,	5
counsels,	5
and	5
entreaties	5
prevailed	5
with	5
him,	5
determined	5
to	5
have	5
recourse	5
to	5
his	5
own	5
ingenuity	5
and	5
compel	5
him,	5
if	5
he	5
could,	5
to	5
wait	5
till	5
daylight;	5
and	5
so,	5
while	5
tightening	5
the	5
girths	5
of	5
the	5
horse,	5
he	5
quietly	5
and	5
without	5
being	5
felt,	5
with	5
his	5
ass’	5
halter	5
tied	5
both	5
Rocinante’s	5
legs,	5
so	5
that	5
when	5
Don	5
Quixote	5
strove	5
to	5
go	5
he	5
was	5
unable	5
as	5
the	5
horse	5
could	5
only	5
move	5
by	5
jumps.	5
Seeing	5
the	5
success	5
of	5
his	5
trick,	5
Sancho	5
Panza	5
said:	5
“See	5
there,	5
señor!	5
Heaven,	5
moved	5
by	5
my	5
tears	5
and	5
prayers,	5
has	5
so	5
ordered	5
it	5
that	5
Rocinante	5
cannot	5
stir;	5
and	5
if	5
you	5
will	5
be	5
obstinate,	5
and	5
spur	5
and	5
strike	5
him,	5
you	5
will	5
only	5
provoke	5
fortune,	5
and	5
kick,	5
as	5
they	5
say,	5
against	5
the	5
pricks.”	5
Don	5
Quixote	5
at	5
this	5
grew	5
desperate,	5
but	5
the	5
more	5
he	5
drove	5
his	5
heels	5
into	5
the	5
horse,	5
the	5
less	5
he	5
stirred	5
him;	5
and	5
not	5
having	5
any	5
suspicion	5
of	5
the	5
tying,	5
he	5
was	5
fain	5
to	5
resign	5
himself	5
and	5
wait	5
till	5
daybreak	5
or	5
until	5
Rocinante	5
could	5
move,	5
firmly	5
persuaded	5
that	5
all	5
this	5
came	5
of	5
something	5
other	5
than	5
Sancho’s	5
ingenuity.	5
So	5
he	5
said	5
to	5
him,	5
“As	5
it	5
is	5
so,	5
Sancho,	5
and	5
as	5
Rocinante	5
cannot	5
move,	5
I	5
am	5
content	5
to	5
wait	5
till	5
dawn	5
smiles	5
upon	5
us,	5
even	5
though	5
I	5
weep	5
while	5
it	5
delays	5
its	5
coming.”	5
“There	5
is	5
no	5
need	5
to	5
weep,”	5
answered	5
Sancho,	5
“for	5
I	5
will	5
amuse	5
your	5
worship	5
by	5
telling	5
stories	5
from	5
this	5
till	5
daylight,	5
unless	5
indeed	5
you	5
like	5
to	5
dismount	5
and	5
lie	5
down	5
to	5
sleep	5
a	5
little	5
on	5
the	5
green	5
grass	5
after	5
the	5
fashion	5
of	5
knights-errant,	5
so	5
as	5
to	5
be	5
fresher	5
when	5
day	5
comes	5
and	5
the	5
moment	5
arrives	5
for	5
attempting	5
this	5
extraordinary	5
adventure	5
you	5
are	5
looking	5
forward	5
to.”	5
“What	5
art	5
thou	5
talking	5
about	5
dismounting	5
or	5
sleeping	5
for?”	5
said	5
Don	5
Quixote.	5
“Am	5
I,	5
thinkest	5
thou,	5
one	5
of	5
those	5
knights	5
that	5
take	5
their	5
rest	5
in	5
the	5
presence	5
of	5
danger?	5
Sleep	5
thou	5
who	5
art	5
born	5
to	5
sleep,	5
or	5
do	5
as	5
thou	5
wilt,	5
for	5
I	5
will	5
act	5
as	5
I	5
think	5
most	5
consistent	5
with	5
my	5
character.”	5
“Be	5
not	5
angry,	5
master	5
mine,”	5
replied	5
Sancho,	5
“I	5
did	5
not	5
mean	5
to	5
say	5
that;”	5
and	5
coming	5
close	5
to	5
him	5
he	5
laid	5
one	5
hand	5
on	5
the	5
pommel	5
of	5
the	5
saddle	5
and	5
the	5
other	5
on	5
the	5
cantle	5
so	5
that	5
he	5
held	5
his	5
master’s	5
left	5
thigh	5
in	5
his	5
embrace,	5
not	5
daring	5
to	5
separate	5
a	5
finger’s	5
width	5
from	5
him;	5
so	5
much	5
afraid	5
was	5
he	5
of	5
the	5
strokes	5
which	5
still	5
resounded	5
with	5
a	5
regular	5
beat.	5
Don	5
Quixote	5
bade	5
him	5
tell	5
some	5
story	5
to	5
amuse	5
him	5
as	5
he	5
had	5
proposed,	5
to	5
which	5
Sancho	5
replied	5
that	5
he	5
would	5
if	5
his	5
dread	5
of	5
what	5
he	5
heard	5
would	5
let	5
him;	5
“Still,”	5
said	5
he,	5
“I	5
will	5
strive	5
to	5
tell	5
a	5
story	5
which,	5
if	5
I	5
can	5
manage	5
to	5
relate	5
it,	5
and	5
nobody	5
interferes	5
with	5
the	5
telling,	5
is	5
the	5
best	5
of	5
stories,	5
and	5
let	5
your	5
worship	5
give	5
me	5
your	5
attention,	5
for	5
here	5
I	5
begin.	5
What	5
was,	5
was;	5
and	5
may	5
the	5
good	5
that	5
is	5
to	5
come	5
be	5
for	5
all,	5
and	5
the	5
evil	5
for	5
him	5
who	5
goes	5
to	5
look	5
for	5
it—your	5
worship	5
must	5
know	5
that	5
the	5
beginning	5
the	5
old	5
folk	5
used	5
to	5
put	5
to	5
their	5
tales	5
was	5
not	5
just	5
as	5
each	5
one	5
pleased;	5
it	5
was	5
a	5
maxim	5
of	5
Cato	5
Zonzorino	5
the	5
Roman,	5
that	5
says	5
‘the	5
evil	5
for	5
him	5
that	5
goes	5
to	5
look	5
for	5
it,’	5
and	5
it	5
comes	5
as	5
pat	5
to	5
the	5
purpose	5
now	5
as	5
ring	5
to	5
finger,	5
to	5
show	5
that	5
your	5
worship	5
should	5
keep	5
quiet	5
and	5
not	5
go	5
looking	5
for	5
evil	5
in	5
any	5
quarter,	5
and	5
that	5
we	5
should	5
go	5
back	5
by	5
some	5
other	5
road,	5
since	5
nobody	5
forces	5
us	5
to	5
follow	5
this	5
in	5
which	5
so	5
many	5
terrors	5
affright	5
us.”	5
“Go	5
on	5
with	5
thy	5
story,	5
Sancho,”	5
said	5
Don	5
Quixote,	5
“and	5
leave	5
the	5
choice	5
of	5
our	5
road	5
to	5
my	5
care.”	5
“I	5
say	5
then,”	5
continued	5
Sancho,	5
“that	5
in	5
a	5
village	5
of	5
Estremadura	5
there	5
was	5
a	5
goat-shepherd—that	5
is	5
to	5
say,	5
one	5
who	5
tended	5
goats—which	5
shepherd	5
or	5
goatherd,	5
as	5
my	5
story	5
goes,	5
was	5
called	5
Lope	5
Ruiz,	5
and	5
this	5
Lope	5
Ruiz	5
was	5
in	5
love	5
with	5
a	5
shepherdess	5
called	5
Torralva,	5
which	5
shepherdess	5
called	5
Torralva	5
was	5
the	5
daughter	5
of	5
a	5
rich	5
grazier,	5
and	5
this	5
rich	5
grazier—”	5
“If	5
that	5
is	5
the	5
way	5
thou	5
tellest	5
thy	5
tale,	5
Sancho,”	5
said	5
Don	5
Quixote,	5
“repeating	5
twice	5
all	5
thou	5
hast	5
to	5
say,	5
thou	5
wilt	5
not	5
have	5
done	5
these	5
two	5
days;	5
go	5
straight	5
on	5
with	5
it,	5
and	5
tell	5
it	5
like	5
a	5
reasonable	5
man,	5
or	5
else	5
say	5
nothing.”	5
“Tales	5
are	5
always	5
told	5
in	5
my	5
country	5
in	5
the	5
very	5
way	5
I	5
am	5
telling	5
this,”	5
answered	5
Sancho,	5
“and	5
I	5
cannot	5
tell	5
it	5
in	5
any	5
other,	5
nor	5
is	5
it	5
right	5
of	5
your	5
worship	5
to	5
ask	5
me	5
to	5
make	5
new	5
customs.”	5
“Tell	5
it	5
as	5
thou	5
wilt,”	5
replied	5
Don	5
Quixote;	5
“and	5
as	5
fate	5
will	5
have	5
it	5
that	5
I	5
cannot	5
help	5
listening	5
to	5
thee,	5
go	5
on.”	5
“And	5
so,	5
lord	5
of	5
my	5
soul,”	5
continued	5
Sancho,	5
as	5
I	5
have	5
said,	5
this	5
shepherd	5
was	5
in	5
love	5
with	5
Torralva	5
the	5
shepherdess,	5
who	5
was	5
a	5
wild	5
buxom	5
lass	5
with	5
something	5
of	5
the	5
look	5
of	5
a	5
man	5
about	5
her,	5
for	5
she	5
had	5
little	5
moustaches;	5
I	5
fancy	5
I	5
see	5
her	5
now.”	5
“Then	5
you	5
knew	5
her?”	5
said	5
Don	5
Quixote.	5
“I	5
did	5
not	5
know	5
her,”	5
said	5
Sancho,	5
“but	5
he	5
who	5
told	5
me	5
the	5
story	5
said	5
it	5
was	5
so	5
true	5
and	5
certain	5
that	5
when	5
I	5
told	5
it	5
to	5
another	5
I	5
might	5
safely	5
declare	5
and	5
swear	5
I	5
had	5
seen	5
it	5
all	5
myself.	5
And	5
so	5
in	5
course	5
of	5
time,	5
the	5
devil,	5
who	5
never	5
sleeps	5
and	5
puts	5
everything	5
in	5
confusion,	5
contrived	5
that	5
the	5
love	5
the	5
shepherd	5
bore	5
the	5
shepherdess	5
turned	5
into	5
hatred	5
and	5
ill-will,	5
and	5
the	5
reason,	5
according	5
to	5
evil	5
tongues,	5
was	5
some	5
little	5
jealousy	5
she	5
caused	5
him	5
that	5
crossed	5
the	5
line	5
and	5
trespassed	5
on	5
forbidden	5
ground;	5
and	5
so	5
much	5
did	5
the	5
shepherd	5
hate	5
her	5
from	5
that	5
time	5
forward	5
that,	5
in	5
order	5
to	5
escape	5
from	5
her,	5
he	5
determined	5
to	5
quit	5
the	5
country	5
and	5
go	5
where	5
he	5
should	5
never	5
set	5
eyes	5
on	5
her	5
again.	5
Torralva,	5
when	5
she	5
found	5
herself	5
spurned	5
by	5
Lope,	5
was	5
immediately	5
smitten	5
with	5
love	5
for	5
him,	5
though	5
she	5
had	5
never	5
loved	5
him	5
before.”	5
“That	5
is	5
the	5
natural	5
way	5
of	5
women,”	5
said	5
Don	5
Quixote,	5
“to	5
scorn	5
the	5
one	5
that	5
loves	5
them,	5
and	5
love	5
the	5
one	5
that	5
hates	5
them:	5
go	5
on,	5
Sancho.”	5
“It	5
came	5
to	5
pass,”	5
said	5
Sancho,	5
“that	5
the	5
shepherd	5
carried	5
out	5
his	5
intention,	5
and	5
driving	5
his	5
goats	5
before	5
him	5
took	5
his	5
way	5
across	5
the	5
plains	5
of	5
Estremadura	5
to	5
pass	5
over	5
into	5
the	5
Kingdom	5
of	5
Portugal.	5
Torralva,	5
who	5
knew	5
of	5
it,	5
went	5
after	5
him,	5
and	5
on	5
foot	5
and	5
barefoot	5
followed	5
him	5
at	5
a	5
distance,	5
with	5
a	5
pilgrim’s	5
staff	5
in	5
her	5
hand	5
and	5
a	5
scrip	5
round	5
her	5
neck,	5
in	5
which	5
she	5
carried,	5
it	5
is	5
said,	5
a	5
bit	5
of	5
looking-glass	5
and	5
a	5
piece	5
of	5
a	5
comb	5
and	5
some	5
little	5
pot	5
or	5
other	5
of	5
paint	5
for	5
her	5
face;	5
but	5
let	5
her	5
carry	5
what	5
she	5
did,	5
I	5
am	5
not	5
going	5
to	5
trouble	5
myself	5
to	5
prove	5
it;	5
all	5
I	5
say	5
is,	5
that	5
the	5
shepherd,	5
they	5
say,	5
came	5
with	5
his	5
flock	5
to	5
cross	5
over	5
the	5
river	5
Guadiana,	5
which	5
was	5
at	5
that	5
time	5
swollen	5
and	5
almost	5
overflowing	5
its	5
banks,	5
and	5
at	5
the	5
spot	5
he	5
came	5
to	5
there	5
was	5
neither	5
ferry	5
nor	5
boat	5
nor	5
anyone	5
to	5
carry	5
him	5
or	5
his	5
flock	5
to	5
the	5
other	5
side,	5
at	5
which	5
he	5
was	5
much	5
vexed,	5
for	5
he	5
perceived	5
that	5
Torralva	5
was	5
approaching	5
and	5
would	5
give	5
him	5
great	5
annoyance	5
with	5
her	5
tears	5
and	5
entreaties;	5
however,	5
he	5
went	5
looking	5
about	5
so	5
closely	5
that	5
he	5
discovered	5
a	5
fisherman	5
who	5
had	5
alongside	5
of	5
him	5
a	5
boat	5
so	5
small	5
that	5
it	5
could	5
only	5
hold	5
one	5
person	5
and	5
one	5
goat;	5
but	5
for	5
all	5
that	5
he	5
spoke	5
to	5
him	5
and	5
agreed	5
with	5
him	5
to	5
carry	5
himself	5
and	5
his	5
three	5
hundred	5
goats	5
across.	5
The	5
fisherman	5
got	5
into	5
the	5
boat	5
and	5
carried	5
one	5
goat	5
over;	5
he	5
came	5
back	5
and	5
carried	5
another	5
over;	5
he	5
came	5
back	5
again,	5
and	5
again	5
brought	5
over	5
another—let	5
your	5
worship	5
keep	5
count	5
of	5
the	5
goats	5
the	5
fisherman	5
is	5
taking	5
across,	5
for	5
if	5
one	5
escapes	5
the	5
memory	5
there	5
will	5
be	5
an	5
end	5
of	5
the	5
story,	5
and	5
it	5
will	5
be	5
impossible	5
to	5
tell	5
another	5
word	5
of	5
it.	5
To	5
proceed,	5
I	5
must	5
tell	5
you	5
the	5
landing	5
place	5
on	5
the	5
other	5
side	5
was	5
miry	5
and	5
slippery,	5
and	5
the	5
fisherman	5
lost	5
a	5
great	5
deal	5
of	5
time	5
in	5
going	5
and	5
coming;	5
still	5
he	5
returned	5
for	5
another	5
goat,	5
and	5
another,	5
and	5
another.”	5
“Take	5
it	5
for	5
granted	5
he	5
brought	5
them	5
all	5
across,”	5
said	5
Don	5
Quixote,	5
“and	5
don’t	5
keep	5
going	5
and	5
coming	5
in	5
this	5
way,	5
or	5
thou	5
wilt	5
not	5
make	5
an	5
end	5
of	5
bringing	5
them	5
over	5
this	5
twelvemonth.”	5
“How	5
many	5
have	5
gone	5
across	5
so	5
far?”	5
said	5
Sancho.	5
“How	5
the	5
devil	5
do	5
I	5
know?”	5
replied	5
Don	5
Quixote.	5
“There	5
it	5
is,”	5
said	5
Sancho,	5
“what	5
I	5
told	5
you,	5
that	5
you	5
must	5
keep	5
a	5
good	5
count;	5
well	5
then,	5
by	5
God,	5
there	5
is	5
an	5
end	5
of	5
the	5
story,	5
for	5
there	5
is	5
no	5
going	5
any	5
farther.”	5
“How	5
can	5
that	5
be?”	5
said	5
Don	5
Quixote;	5
“is	5
it	5
so	5
essential	5
to	5
the	5
story	5
to	5
know	5
to	5
a	5
nicety	5
the	5
goats	5
that	5
have	5
crossed	5
over,	5
that	5
if	5
there	5
be	5
a	5
mistake	5
of	5
one	5
in	5
the	5
reckoning,	5
thou	5
canst	5
not	5
go	5
on	5
with	5
it?”	5
“No,	5
señor,	5
not	5
a	5
bit,”	5
replied	5
Sancho;	5
“for	5
when	5
I	5
asked	5
your	5
worship	5
to	5
tell	5
me	5
how	5
many	5
goats	5
had	5
crossed,	5
and	5
you	5
answered	5
you	5
did	5
not	5
know,	5
at	5
that	5
very	5
instant	5
all	5
I	5
had	5
to	5
say	5
passed	5
away	5
out	5
of	5
my	5
memory,	5
and,	5
faith,	5
there	5
was	5
much	5
virtue	5
in	5
it,	5
and	5
entertainment.”	5
“So,	5
then,”	5
said	5
Don	5
Quixote,	5
“the	5
story	5
has	5
come	5
to	5
an	5
end?”	5
“As	5
much	5
as	5
my	5
mother	5
has,”	5
said	5
Sancho.	5
“In	5
truth,”	5
said	5
Don	5
Quixote,	5
“thou	5
hast	5
told	5
one	5
of	5
the	5
rarest	5
stories,	5
tales,	5
or	5
histories,	5
that	5
anyone	5
in	5
the	5
world	5
could	5
have	5
imagined,	5
and	5
such	5
a	5
way	5
of	5
telling	5
it	5
and	5
ending	5
it	5
was	5
never	5
seen	5
nor	5
will	5
be	5
in	5
a	5
lifetime;	5
though	5
I	5
expected	5
nothing	5
else	5
from	5
thy	5
excellent	5
understanding.	5
But	5
I	5
do	5
not	5
wonder,	5
for	5
perhaps	5
those	5
ceaseless	5
strokes	5
may	5
have	5
confused	5
thy	5
wits.”	5
“All	5
that	5
may	5
be,”	5
replied	5
Sancho,	5
“but	5
I	5
know	5
that	5
as	5
to	5
my	5
story,	5
all	5
that	5
can	5
be	5
said	5
is	5
that	5
it	5
ends	5
there	5
where	5
the	5
mistake	5
in	5
the	5
count	5
of	5
the	5
passage	5
of	5
the	5
goats	5
begins.”	5
“Let	5
it	5
end	5
where	5
it	5
will,	5
well	5
and	5
good,”	5
said	5
Don	5
Quixote,	5
“and	5
let	5
us	5
see	5
if	5
Rocinante	5
can	5
go;”	5
and	5
again	5
he	5
spurred	5
him,	5
and	5
again	5
Rocinante	5
made	5
jumps	5
and	5
remained	5
where	5
he	5
was,	5
so	5
well	5
tied	5
was	5
he.	5
Just	5
then,	5
whether	5
it	5
was	5
the	5
cold	5
of	5
the	5
morning	5
that	5
was	5
now	5
approaching,	5
or	5
that	5
he	5
had	5
eaten	5
something	5
laxative	5
at	5
supper,	5
or	5
that	5
it	5
was	5
only	5
natural	5
(as	5
is	5
most	5
likely),	5
Sancho	5
felt	5
a	5
desire	5
to	5
do	5
what	5
no	5
one	5
could	5
do	5
for	5
him;	5
but	5
so	5
great	5
was	5
the	5
fear	5
that	5
had	5
penetrated	5
his	5
heart,	5
he	5
dared	5
not	5
separate	5
himself	5
from	5
his	5
master	5
by	5
as	5
much	5
as	5
the	5
black	5
of	5
his	5
nail;	5
to	5
escape	5
doing	5
what	5
he	5
wanted	5
was,	5
however,	5
also	5
impossible;	5
so	5
what	5
he	5
did	5
for	5
peace’s	5
sake	5
was	5
to	5
remove	5
his	5
right	5
hand,	5
which	5
held	5
the	5
back	5
of	5
the	5
saddle,	5
and	5
with	5
it	5
to	5
untie	5
gently	5
and	5
silently	5
the	5
running	5
string	5
which	5
alone	5
held	5
up	5
his	5
breeches,	5
so	5
that	5
on	5
loosening	5
it	5
they	5
at	5
once	5
fell	5
down	5
round	5
his	5
feet	5
like	5
fetters;	5
he	5
then	5
raised	5
his	5
shirt	5
as	5
well	5
as	5
he	5
could	5
and	5
bared	5
his	5
hind	5
quarters,	5
no	5
slim	5
ones.	5
But,	5
this	5
accomplished,	5
which	5
he	5
fancied	5
was	5
all	5
he	5
had	5
to	5
do	5
to	5
get	5
out	5
of	5
this	5
terrible	5
strait	5
and	5
embarrassment,	5
another	5
still	5
greater	5
difficulty	5
presented	5
itself,	5
for	5
it	5
seemed	5
to	5
him	5
impossible	5
to	5
relieve	5
himself	5
without	5
making	5
some	5
noise,	5
and	5
he	5
ground	5
his	5
teeth	5
and	5
squeezed	5
his	5
shoulders	5
together,	5
holding	5
his	5
breath	5
as	5
much	5
as	5
he	5
could;	5
but	5
in	5
spite	5
of	5
his	5
precautions	5
he	5
was	5
unlucky	5
enough	5
after	5
all	5
to	5
make	5
a	5
little	5
noise,	5
very	5
different	5
from	5
that	5
which	5
was	5
causing	5
him	5
so	5
much	5
fear.	5

Don	5
Quixote,	5
hearing	5
it,	5
said,	5
“What	5
noise	5
is	5
that,	5
Sancho?”	5
“I	5
don’t	5
know,	5
señor,”	5
said	5
he;	5
“it	5
must	5
be	5
something	5
new,	5
for	5
adventures	5
and	5
misadventures	5
never	5
begin	5
with	5
a	5
trifle.”	5
Once	5
more	5
he	5
tried	5
his	5
luck,	5
and	5
succeeded	5
so	5
well,	5
that	5
without	5
any	5
further	5
noise	5
or	5
disturbance	5
he	5
found	5
himself	5
relieved	5
of	5
the	5
burden	5
that	5
had	5
given	5
him	5
so	5
much	5
discomfort.	5
But	5
as	5
Don	5
Quixote’s	5
sense	5
of	5
smell	5
was	5
as	5
acute	5
as	5
his	5
hearing,	5
and	5
as	5
Sancho	5
was	5
so	5
closely	5
linked	5
with	5
him	5
that	5
the	5
fumes	5
rose	5
almost	5
in	5
a	5
straight	5
line,	5
it	5
could	5
not	5
be	5
but	5
that	5
some	5
should	5
reach	5
his	5
nose,	5
and	5
as	5
soon	5
as	5
they	5
did	5
he	5
came	5
to	5
its	5
relief	5
by	5
compressing	5
it	5
between	5
his	5
fingers,	5
saying	5
in	5
a	5
rather	5
snuffing	5
tone,	5
“Sancho,	5
it	5
strikes	5
me	5
thou	5
art	5
in	5
great	5
fear.”	5
“I	5
am,”	5
answered	5
Sancho;	5
“but	5
how	5
does	5
your	5
worship	5
perceive	5
it	5
now	5
more	5
than	5
ever?”	5
“Because	5
just	5
now	5
thou	5
smellest	5
stronger	5
than	5
ever,	5
and	5
not	5
of	5
ambergris,”	5
answered	5
Don	5
Quixote.	5
“Very	5
likely,”	5
said	5
Sancho,	5
“but	5
that’s	5
not	5
my	5
fault,	5
but	5
your	5
worship’s,	5
for	5
leading	5
me	5
about	5
at	5
unseasonable	5
hours	5
and	5
at	5
such	5
unwonted	5
paces.”	5
“Then	5
go	5
back	5
three	5
or	5
four,	5
my	5
friend,”	5
said	5
Don	5
Quixote,	5
all	5
the	5
time	5
with	5
his	5
fingers	5
to	5
his	5
nose;	5
“and	5
for	5
the	5
future	5
pay	5
more	5
attention	5
to	5
thy	5
person	5
and	5
to	5
what	5
thou	5
owest	5
to	5
mine;	5
for	5
it	5
is	5
my	5
great	5
familiarity	5
with	5
thee	5
that	5
has	5
bred	5
this	5
contempt.”	5
“I’ll	5
bet,”	5
replied	5
Sancho,	5
“that	5
your	5
worship	5
thinks	5
I	5
have	5
done	5
something	5
I	5
ought	5
not	5
with	5
my	5
person.”	5
“It	5
makes	5
it	5
worse	5
to	5
stir	5
it,	5
friend	5
Sancho,”	5
returned	5
Don	5
Quixote.	5
With	5
this	5
and	5
other	5
talk	5
of	5
the	5
same	5
sort	5
master	5
and	5
man	5
passed	5
the	5
night,	5
till	5
Sancho,	5
perceiving	5
that	5
daybreak	5
was	5
coming	5
on	5
apace,	5
very	5
cautiously	5
untied	5
Rocinante	5
and	5
tied	5
up	5
his	5
breeches.	5
As	5
soon	5
as	5
Rocinante	5
found	5
himself	5
free,	5
though	5
by	5
nature	5
he	5
was	5
not	5
at	5
all	5
mettlesome,	5
he	5
seemed	5
to	5
feel	5
lively	5
and	5
began	5
pawing—for	5
as	5
to	5
capering,	5
begging	5
his	5
pardon,	5
he	5
knew	5
not	5
what	5
it	5
meant.	5
Don	5
Quixote,	5
then,	5
observing	5
that	5
Rocinante	5
could	5
move,	5
took	5
it	5
as	5
a	5
good	5
sign	5
and	5
a	5
signal	5
that	5
he	5
should	5
attempt	5
the	5
dread	5
adventure.	5
By	5
this	5
time	5
day	5
had	5
fully	5
broken	5
and	5
everything	5
showed	5
distinctly,	5
and	5
Don	5
Quixote	5
saw	5
that	5
he	5
was	5
among	5
some	5
tall	5
trees,	5
chestnuts,	5
which	5
cast	5
a	5
very	5
deep	5
shade;	5
he	5
perceived	5
likewise	5
that	5
the	5
sound	5
of	5
the	5
strokes	5
did	5
not	5
cease,	5
but	5
could	5
not	5
discover	5
what	5
caused	5
it,	5
and	5
so	5
without	5
any	5
further	5
delay	5
he	5
let	5
Rocinante	5
feel	5
the	5
spur,	5
and	5
once	5
more	5
taking	5
leave	5
of	5
Sancho,	5
he	5
told	5
him	5
to	5
wait	5
for	5
him	5
there	5
three	5
days	5
at	5
most,	5
as	5
he	5
had	5
said	5
before,	5
and	5
if	5
he	5
should	5
not	5
have	5
returned	5
by	5
that	5
time,	5
he	5
might	5
feel	5
sure	5
it	5
had	5
been	5
God’s	5
will	5
that	5
he	5
should	5
end	5
his	5
days	5
in	5
that	5
perilous	5
adventure.	5
He	5
again	5
repeated	5
the	5
message	5
and	5
commission	5
with	5
which	5
he	5
was	5
to	5
go	5
on	5
his	5
behalf	5
to	5
his	5
lady	5
Dulcinea,	5
and	5
said	5
he	5
was	5
not	5
to	5
be	5
uneasy	5
as	5
to	5
the	5
payment	5
of	5
his	5
services,	5
for	5
before	5
leaving	5
home	5
he	5
had	5
made	5
his	5
will,	5
in	5
which	5
he	5
would	5
find	5
himself	5
fully	5
recompensed	5
in	5
the	5
matter	5
of	5
wages	5
in	5
due	5
proportion	5
to	5
the	5
time	5
he	5
had	5
served;	5
but	5
if	5
God	5
delivered	5
him	5
safe,	5
sound,	5
and	5
unhurt	5
out	5
of	5
that	5
danger,	5
he	5
might	5
look	5
upon	5
the	5
promised	5
island	5
as	5
much	5
more	5
than	5
certain.	5
Sancho	5
began	5
to	5
weep	5
afresh	5
on	5
again	5
hearing	5
the	5
affecting	5
words	5
of	5
his	5
good	5
master,	5
and	5
resolved	5
to	5
stay	5
with	5
him	5
until	5
the	5
final	5
issue	5
and	5
end	5
of	5
the	5
business.	5
From	5
these	5
tears	5
and	5
this	5
honourable	5
resolve	5
of	5
Sancho	5
Panza’s	5
the	5
author	5
of	5
this	5
history	5
infers	5
that	5
he	5
must	5
have	5
been	5
of	5
good	5
birth	5
and	5
at	5
least	5
an	5
old	5
Christian;	5
and	5
the	5
feeling	5
he	5
displayed	5
touched	5
his	5
but	5
not	5
so	5
much	5
as	5
to	5
make	5
him	5
show	5
any	5
weakness;	5
on	5
the	5
contrary,	5
hiding	5
what	5
he	5
felt	5
as	5
well	5
as	5
he	5
could,	5
he	5
began	5
to	5
move	5
towards	5
that	5
quarter	5
whence	5
the	5
sound	5
of	5
the	5
water	5
and	5
of	5
the	5
strokes	5
seemed	5
to	5
come.	5
Sancho	5
followed	5
him	5
on	5
foot,	5
leading	5
by	5
the	5
halter,	5
as	5
his	5
custom	5
was,	5
his	5
ass,	5
his	5
constant	5
comrade	5
in	5
prosperity	5
or	5
adversity;	5
and	5
advancing	5
some	5
distance	5
through	5
the	5
shady	5
chestnut	5
trees	5
they	5
came	5
upon	5
a	5
little	5
meadow	5
at	5
the	5
foot	5
of	5
some	5
high	5
rocks,	5
down	5
which	5
a	5
mighty	5
rush	5
of	5
water	5
flung	5
itself.	5
At	5
the	5
foot	5
of	5
the	5
rocks	5
were	5
some	5
rudely	5
constructed	5
houses	5
looking	5
more	5
like	5
ruins	5
than	5
houses,	5
from	5
among	5
which	5
came,	5
they	5
perceived,	5
the	5
din	5
and	5
clatter	5
of	5
blows,	5
which	5
still	5
continued	5
without	5
intermission.	5
Rocinante	5
took	5
fright	5
at	5
the	5
noise	5
of	5
the	5
water	5
and	5
of	5
the	5
blows,	5
but	5
quieting	5
him	5
Don	5
Quixote	5
advanced	5
step	5
by	5
step	5
towards	5
the	5
houses,	5
commending	5
himself	5
with	5
all	5
his	5
heart	5
to	5
his	5
lady,	5
imploring	5
her	5
support	5
in	5
that	5
dread	5
pass	5
and	5
enterprise,	5
and	5
on	5
the	5
way	5
commending	5
himself	5
to	5
God,	5
too,	5
not	5
to	5
forget	5
him.	5
Sancho	5
who	5
never	5
quitted	5
his	5
side,	5
stretched	5
his	5
neck	5
as	5
far	5
as	5
he	5
could	5
and	5
peered	5
between	5
the	5
legs	5
of	5
Rocinante	5
to	5
see	5
if	5
he	5
could	5
now	5
discover	5
what	5
it	5
was	5
that	5
caused	5
him	5
such	5
fear	5
and	5
apprehension.	5
They	5
went	5
it	5
might	5
be	5
a	5
hundred	5
paces	5
farther,	5
when	5
on	5
turning	5
a	5
corner	5
the	5
true	5
cause,	5
beyond	5
the	5
possibility	5
of	5
any	5
mistake,	5
of	5
that	5
dread-sounding	5
and	5
to	5
them	5
awe-inspiring	5
noise	5
that	5
had	5
kept	5
them	5
all	5
the	5
night	5
in	5
such	5
fear	5
and	5
perplexity,	5
appeared	5
plain	5
and	5
obvious;	5
and	5
it	5
was	5
(if,	5
reader,	5
thou	5
art	5
not	5
disgusted	5
and	5
disappointed)	5
six	5
fulling	5
hammers	5
which	5
by	5
their	5
alternate	5
strokes	5
made	5
all	5
the	5
din.	5
When	5
Don	5
Quixote	5
perceived	5
what	5
it	5
was,	5
he	5
was	5
struck	5
dumb	5
and	5
rigid	5
from	5
head	5
to	5
foot.	5
Sancho	5
glanced	5
at	5
him	5
and	5
saw	5
him	5
with	5
his	5
head	5
bent	5
down	5
upon	5
his	5
breast	5
in	5
manifest	5
mortification;	5
and	5
Don	5
Quixote	5
glanced	5
at	5
Sancho	5
and	5
saw	5
him	5
with	5
his	5
cheeks	5
puffed	5
out	5
and	5
his	5
mouth	5
full	5
of	5
laughter,	5
and	5
evidently	5
ready	5
to	5
explode	5
with	5
it,	5
and	5
in	5
spite	5
of	5
his	5
vexation	5
he	5
could	5
not	5
help	5
laughing	5
at	5
the	5
sight	5
of	5
him;	5
and	5
when	5
Sancho	5
saw	5
his	5
master	5
begin	5
he	5
let	5
go	5
so	5
heartily	5
that	5
he	5
had	5
to	5
hold	5
his	5
sides	5
with	5
both	5
hands	5
to	5
keep	5
himself	5
from	5
bursting	5
with	5
laughter.	5
Four	5
times	5
he	5
stopped,	5
and	5
as	5
many	5
times	5
did	5
his	5
laughter	5
break	5
out	5
afresh	5
with	5
the	5
same	5
violence	5
as	5
at	5
first,	5
whereat	5
Don	5
Quixote	5
grew	5
furious,	5
above	5
all	5
when	5
he	5
heard	5
him	5
say	5
mockingly,	5
“Thou	5
must	5
know,	5
friend	5
Sancho,	5
that	5
of	5
Heaven’s	5
will	5
I	5
was	5
born	5
in	5
this	5
our	5
iron	5
age	5
to	5
revive	5
in	5
it	5
the	5
golden	5
or	5
age	5
of	5
gold;	5
I	5
am	5
he	5
for	5
whom	5
are	5
reserved	5
perils,	5
mighty	5
achievements,	5
valiant	5
deeds;”	5
and	5
here	5
he	5
went	5
on	5
repeating	5
the	5
words	5
that	5
Don	5
Quixote	5
uttered	5
the	5
first	5
time	5
they	5
heard	5
the	5
awful	5
strokes.	5
Don	5
Quixote,	5
then,	5
seeing	5
that	5
Sancho	5
was	5
turning	5
him	5
into	5
ridicule,	5
was	5
so	5
mortified	5
and	5
vexed	5
that	5
he	5
lifted	5
up	5
his	5
pike	5
and	5
smote	5
him	5
two	5
such	5
blows	5
that	5
if,	5
instead	5
of	5
catching	5
them	5
on	5
his	5
shoulders,	5
he	5
had	5
caught	5
them	5
on	5
his	5
head	5
there	5
would	5
have	5
been	5
no	5
wages	5
to	5
pay,	5
unless	5
indeed	5
to	5
his	5
heirs.	5
Sancho	5
seeing	5
that	5
he	5
was	5
getting	5
an	5
awkward	5
return	5
in	5
earnest	5
for	5
his	5
jest,	5
and	5
fearing	5
his	5
master	5
might	5
carry	5
it	5
still	5
further,	5
said	5
to	5
him	5
very	5
humbly,	5
“Calm	5
yourself,	5
sir,	5
for	5
by	5
God	5
I	5
am	5
only	5
joking.”	5
“Well,	5
then,	5
if	5
you	5
are	5
joking	5
I	5
am	5
not,”	5
replied	5
Don	5
Quixote.	5
“Look	5
here,	5
my	5
lively	5
gentleman,	5
if	5
these,	5
instead	5
of	5
being	5
fulling	5
hammers,	5
had	5
been	5
some	5
perilous	5
adventure,	5
have	5
I	5
not,	5
think	5
you,	5
shown	5
the	5
courage	5
required	5
for	5
the	5
attempt	5
and	5
achievement?	5
Am	5
I,	5
perchance,	5
being,	5
as	5
I	5
am,	5
a	5
gentleman,	5
bound	5
to	5
know	5
and	5
distinguish	5
sounds	5
and	5
tell	5
whether	5
they	5
come	5
from	5
fulling	5
mills	5
or	5
not;	5
and	5
that,	5
when	5
perhaps,	5
as	5
is	5
the	5
case,	5
I	5
have	5
never	5
in	5
my	5
life	5
seen	5
any	5
as	5
you	5
have,	5
low	5
boor	5
as	5
you	5
are,	5
that	5
have	5
been	5
born	5
and	5
bred	5
among	5
them?	5
But	5
turn	5
me	5
these	5
six	5
hammers	5
into	5
six	5
giants,	5
and	5
bring	5
them	5
to	5
beard	5
me,	5
one	5
by	5
one	5
or	5
all	5
together,	5
and	5
if	5
I	5
do	5
not	5
knock	5
them	5
head	5
over	5
heels,	5
then	5
make	5
what	5
mockery	5
you	5
like	5
of	5
me.”	5
“No	5
more	5
of	5
that,	5
señor,”	5
returned	5
Sancho;	5
“I	5
own	5
I	5
went	5
a	5
little	5
too	5
far	5
with	5
the	5
joke.	5
But	5
tell	5
me,	5
your	5
worship,	5
now	5
that	5
peace	5
is	5
made	5
between	5
us	5
(and	5
may	5
God	5
bring	5
you	5
out	5
of	5
all	5
the	5
adventures	5
that	5
may	5
befall	5
you	5
as	5
safe	5
and	5
sound	5
as	5
he	5
has	5
brought	5
you	5
out	5
of	5
this	5
one),	5
was	5
it	5
not	5
a	5
thing	5
to	5
laugh	5
at,	5
and	5
is	5
it	5
not	5
a	5
good	5
story,	5
the	5
great	5
fear	5
we	5
were	5
in?—at	5
least	5
that	5
I	5
was	5
in;	5
for	5
as	5
to	5
your	5
worship	5
I	5
see	5
now	5
that	5
you	5
neither	5
know	5
nor	5
understand	5
what	5
either	5
fear	5
or	5
dismay	5
is.”	5
“I	5
do	5
not	5
deny,”	5
said	5
Don	5
Quixote,	5
“that	5
what	5
happened	5
to	5
us	5
may	5
be	5
worth	5
laughing	5
at,	5
but	5
it	5
is	5
not	5
worth	5
making	5
a	5
story	5
about,	5
for	5
it	5
is	5
not	5
everyone	5
that	5
is	5
shrewd	5
enough	5
to	5
hit	5
the	5
right	5
point	5
of	5
a	5
thing.”	5
“At	5
any	5
rate,”	5
said	5
Sancho,	5
“your	5
worship	5
knew	5
how	5
to	5
hit	5
the	5
right	5
point	5
with	5
your	5
pike,	5
aiming	5
at	5
my	5
head	5
and	5
hitting	5
me	5
on	5
the	5
shoulders,	5
thanks	5
be	5
to	5
God	5
and	5
my	5
own	5
smartness	5
in	5
dodging	5
it.	5
But	5
let	5
that	5
pass;	5
all	5
will	5
come	5
out	5
in	5
the	5
scouring;	5
for	5
I	5
have	5
heard	5
say	5
‘he	5
loves	5
thee	5
well	5
that	5
makes	5
thee	5
weep;’	5
and	5
moreover	5
that	5
it	5
is	5
the	5
way	5
with	5
great	5
lords	5
after	5
any	5
hard	5
words	5
they	5
give	5
a	5
servant	5
to	5
give	5
him	5
a	5
pair	5
of	5
breeches;	5
though	5
I	5
do	5
not	5
know	5
what	5
they	5
give	5
after	5
blows,	5
unless	5
it	5
be	5
that	5
knights-errant	5
after	5
blows	5
give	5
islands,	5
or	5
kingdoms	5
on	5
the	5
mainland.”	5
“It	5
may	5
be	5
on	5
the	5
dice,”	5
said	5
Don	5
Quixote,	5
“that	5
all	5
thou	5
sayest	5
will	5
come	5
true;	5
overlook	5
the	5
past,	5
for	5
thou	5
art	5
shrewd	5
enough	5
to	5
know	5
that	5
our	5
first	5
movements	5
are	5
not	5
in	5
our	5
own	5
control;	5
and	5
one	5
thing	5
for	5
the	5
future	5
bear	5
in	5
mind,	5
that	5
thou	5
curb	5
and	5
restrain	5
thy	5
loquacity	5
in	5
my	5
company;	5
for	5
in	5
all	5
the	5
books	5
of	5
chivalry	5
that	5
I	5
have	5
read,	5
and	5
they	5
are	5
innumerable,	5
I	5
never	5
met	5
with	5
a	5
squire	5
who	5
talked	5
so	5
much	5
to	5
his	5
lord	5
as	5
thou	5
dost	5
to	5
thine;	5
and	5
in	5
fact	5
I	5
feel	5
it	5
to	5
be	5
a	5
great	5
fault	5
of	5
thine	5
and	5
of	5
mine:	5
of	5
thine,	5
that	5
thou	5
hast	5
so	5
little	5
respect	5
for	5
me;	5
of	5
mine,	5
that	5
I	5
do	5
not	5
make	5
myself	5
more	5
respected.	5
There	5
was	5
Gandalin,	5
the	5
squire	5
of	5
Amadis	5
of	5
Gaul,	5
that	5
was	5
Count	5
of	5
the	5
Insula	5
Firme,	5
and	5
we	5
read	5
of	5
him	5
that	5
he	5
always	5
addressed	5
his	5
lord	5
with	5
his	5
cap	5
in	5
his	5
hand,	5
his	5
head	5
bowed	5
down	5
and	5
his	5
body	5
bent	5
double,	5
more	5
turquesco.	5
And	5
then,	5
what	5
shall	5
we	5
say	5
of	5
Gasabal,	5
the	5
squire	5
of	5
Galaor,	5
who	5
was	5
so	5
silent	5
that	5
in	5
order	5
to	5
indicate	5
to	5
us	5
the	5
greatness	5
of	5
his	5
marvellous	5
taciturnity	5
his	5
name	5
is	5
only	5
once	5
mentioned	5
in	5
the	5
whole	5
of	5
that	5
history,	5
as	5
long	5
as	5
it	5
is	5
truthful?	5
From	5
all	5
I	5
have	5
said	5
thou	5
wilt	5
gather,	5
Sancho,	5
that	5
there	5
must	5
be	5
a	5
difference	5
between	5
master	5
and	5
man,	5
between	5
lord	5
and	5
lackey,	5
between	5
knight	5
and	5
squire:	5
so	5
that	5
from	5
this	5
day	5
forward	5
in	5
our	5
intercourse	5
we	5
must	5
observe	5
more	5
respect	5
and	5
take	5
less	5
liberties,	5
for	5
in	5
whatever	5
way	5
I	5
may	5
be	5
provoked	5
with	5
you	5
it	5
will	5
be	5
bad	5
for	5
the	5
pitcher.	5
The	5
favours	5
and	5
benefits	5
that	5
I	5
have	5
promised	5
you	5
will	5
come	5
in	5
due	5
time,	5
and	5
if	5
they	5
do	5
not	5
your	5
wages	5
at	5
least	5
will	5
not	5
be	5
lost,	5
as	5
I	5
have	5
already	5
told	5
you.”	5
“All	5
that	5
your	5
worship	5
says	5
is	5
very	5
well,”	5
said	5
Sancho,	5
“but	5
I	5
should	5
like	5
to	5
know	5
(in	5
case	5
the	5
time	5
of	5
favours	5
should	5
not	5
come,	5
and	5
it	5
might	5
be	5
necessary	5
to	5
fall	5
back	5
upon	5
wages)	5
how	5
much	5
did	5
the	5
squire	5
of	5
a	5
knight-errant	5
get	5
in	5
those	5
days,	5
and	5
did	5
they	5
agree	5
by	5
the	5
month,	5
or	5
by	5
the	5
day	5
like	5
bricklayers?”	5
“I	5
do	5
not	5
believe,”	5
replied	5
Don	5
Quixote,	5
“that	5
such	5
squires	5
were	5
ever	5
on	5
wages,	5
but	5
were	5
dependent	5
on	5
favour;	5
and	5
if	5
I	5
have	5
now	5
mentioned	5
thine	5
in	5
the	5
sealed	5
will	5
I	5
have	5
left	5
at	5
home,	5
it	5
was	5
with	5
a	5
view	5
to	5
what	5
may	5
happen;	5
for	5
as	5
yet	5
I	5
know	5
not	5
how	5
chivalry	5
will	5
turn	5
out	5
in	5
these	5
wretched	5
times	5
of	5
ours,	5
and	5
I	5
do	5
not	5
wish	5
my	5
soul	5
to	5
suffer	5
for	5
trifles	5
in	5
the	5
other	5
world;	5
for	5
I	5
would	5
have	5
thee	5
know,	5
Sancho,	5
that	5
in	5
this	5
there	5
is	5
no	5
condition	5
more	5
hazardous	5
than	5
that	5
of	5
adventurers.”	5
“That	5
is	5
true,”	5
said	5
Sancho,	5
“since	5
the	5
mere	5
noise	5
of	5
the	5
hammers	5
of	5
a	5
fulling	5
mill	5
can	5
disturb	5
and	5
disquiet	5
the	5
heart	5
of	5
such	5
a	5
valiant	5
errant	5
adventurer	5
as	5
your	5
worship;	5
but	5
you	5
may	5
be	5
sure	5
I	5
will	5
not	5
open	5
my	5
lips	5
henceforward	5
to	5
make	5
light	5
of	5
anything	5
of	5
your	5
worship’s,	5
but	5
only	5
to	5
honour	5
you	5
as	5
my	5
master	5
and	5
natural	5
lord.”	5
“By	5
so	5
doing,”	5
replied	5
Don	5
Quixote,	5
“shalt	5
thou	5
live	5
long	5
on	5
the	5
face	5
of	5
the	5
earth;	5
for	5
next	5
to	5
parents,	5
masters	5
are	5
to	5
be	5
respected	5
as	5
though	5
they	5
were	5
parents.”	5

c20a.jpg	5
(73K)	5
Full	5
Size	5
It	5
now	5
began	5
to	5
rain	5
a	5
little,	5
and	5
Sancho	5
was	5
for	5
going	5
into	5
the	5
fulling	5
mills,	5
but	5
Don	5
Quixote	5
had	5
taken	5
such	5
an	5
abhorrence	5
to	5
them	5
on	5
account	5
of	5
the	5
late	5
joke	5
that	5
he	5
would	5
not	5
enter	5
them	5
on	5
any	5
account;	5
so	5
turning	5
aside	5
to	5
right	5
they	5
came	5
upon	5
another	5
road,	5
different	5
from	5
that	5
which	5
they	5
had	5
taken	5
the	5
night	5
before.	5
Shortly	5
afterwards	5
Don	5
Quixote	5
perceived	5
a	5
man	5
on	5
horseback	5
who	5
wore	5
on	5
his	5
head	5
something	5
that	5
shone	5
like	5
gold,	5
and	5
the	5
moment	5
he	5
saw	5
him	5
he	5
turned	5
to	5
Sancho	5
and	5
said:	5
“I	5
think,	5
Sancho,	5
there	5
is	5
no	5
proverb	5
that	5
is	5
not	5
true,	5
all	5
being	5
maxims	5
drawn	5
from	5
experience	5
itself,	5
the	5
mother	5
of	5
all	5
the	5
sciences,	5
especially	5
that	5
one	5
that	5
says,	5
‘Where	5
one	5
door	5
shuts,	5
another	5
opens.’	5
I	5
say	5
so	5
because	5
if	5
last	5
night	5
fortune	5
shut	5
the	5
door	5
of	5
the	5
adventure	5
we	5
were	5
looking	5
for	5
against	5
us,	5
cheating	5
us	5
with	5
the	5
fulling	5
mills,	5
it	5
now	5
opens	5
wide	5
another	5
one	5
for	5
another	5
better	5
and	5
more	5
certain	5
adventure,	5
and	5
if	5
I	5
do	5
not	5
contrive	5
to	5
enter	5
it,	5
it	5
will	5
be	5
my	5
own	5
fault,	5
and	5
I	5
cannot	5
lay	5
it	5
to	5
my	5
ignorance	5
of	5
fulling	5
mills,	5
or	5
the	5
darkness	5
of	5
the	5
night.	5
I	5
say	5
this	5
because,	5
if	5
I	5
mistake	5
not,	5
there	5
comes	5
towards	5
us	5
one	5
who	5
wears	5
on	5
his	5
head	5
the	5
helmet	5
of	5
Mambrino,	5
concerning	5
which	5
I	5
took	5
the	5
oath	5
thou	5
rememberest.”	5
“Mind	5
what	5
you	5
say,	5
your	5
worship,	5
and	5
still	5
more	5
what	5
you	5
do,”	5
said	5
Sancho,	5
“for	5
I	5
don’t	5
want	5
any	5
more	5
fulling	5
mills	5
to	5
finish	5
off	5
fulling	5
and	5
knocking	5
our	5
senses	5
out.”	5
“The	5
devil	5
take	5
thee,	5
man,”	5
said	5
Don	5
Quixote;	5
“what	5
has	5
a	5
helmet	5
to	5
do	5
with	5
fulling	5
mills?”	5
“I	5
don’t	5
know,”	5
replied	5
Sancho,	5
“but,	5
faith,	5
if	5
I	5
might	5
speak	5
as	5
I	5
used,	5
perhaps	5
I	5
could	5
give	5
such	5
reasons	5
that	5
your	5
worship	5
would	5
see	5
you	5
were	5
mistaken	5
in	5
what	5
you	5
say.”	5
“How	5
can	5
I	5
be	5
mistaken	5
in	5
what	5
I	5
say,	5
unbelieving	5
traitor?”	5
returned	5
Don	5
Quixote;	5
“tell	5
me,	5
seest	5
thou	5
not	5
yonder	5
knight	5
coming	5
towards	5
us	5
on	5
a	5
dappled	5
grey	5
steed,	5
who	5
has	5
upon	5
his	5
head	5
a	5
helmet	5
of	5
gold?”	5
“What	5
I	5
see	5
and	5
make	5
out,”	5
answered	5
Sancho,	5
“is	5
only	5
a	5
man	5
on	5
a	5
grey	5
ass	5
like	5
my	5
own,	5
who	5
has	5
something	5
that	5
shines	5
on	5
his	5
head.”	5
“Well,	5
that	5
is	5
the	5
helmet	5
of	5
Mambrino,”	5
said	5
Don	5
Quixote;	5
“stand	5
to	5
one	5
side	5
and	5
leave	5
me	5
alone	5
with	5
him;	5
thou	5
shalt	5
see	5
how,	5
without	5
saying	5
a	5
word,	5
to	5
save	5
time,	5
I	5
shall	5
bring	5
this	5
adventure	5
to	5
an	5
issue	5
and	5
possess	5
myself	5
of	5
the	5
helmet	5
I	5
have	5
so	5
longed	5
for.”	5
“I	5
will	5
take	5
care	5
to	5
stand	5
aside,”	5
said	5
Sancho;	5
“but	5
God	5
grant,	5
I	5
say	5
once	5
more,	5
that	5
it	5
may	5
be	5
marjoram	5
and	5
not	5
fulling	5
mills.”	5
“I	5
have	5
told	5
thee,	5
brother,	5
on	5
no	5
account	5
to	5
mention	5
those	5
fulling	5
mills	5
to	5
me	5
again,”	5
said	5
Don	5
Quixote,	5
“or	5
I	5
vow—and	5
I	5
say	5
no	5
more—I’ll	5
full	5
the	5
soul	5
out	5
of	5
you.”	5
Sancho	5
held	5
his	5
peace	5
in	5
dread	5
lest	5
his	5
master	5
should	5
carry	5
out	5
the	5
vow	5
he	5
had	5
hurled	5
like	5
a	5
bowl	5
at	5
him.	5
The	5
fact	5
of	5
the	5
matter	5
as	5
regards	5
the	5
helmet,	5
steed,	5
and	5
knight	5
that	5
Don	5
Quixote	5
saw,	5
was	5
this.	5
In	5
that	5
neighbourhood	5
there	5
were	5
two	5
villages,	5
one	5
of	5
them	5
so	5
small	5
that	5
it	5
had	5
neither	5
apothecary’s	5
shop	5
nor	5
barber,	5
which	5
the	5
other	5
that	5
was	5
close	5
to	5
it	5
had,	5
so	5
the	5
barber	5
of	5
the	5
larger	5
served	5
the	5
smaller,	5
and	5
in	5
it	5
there	5
was	5
a	5
sick	5
man	5
who	5
required	5
to	5
be	5
bled	5
and	5
another	5
man	5
who	5
wanted	5
to	5
be	5
shaved,	5
and	5
on	5
this	5
errand	5
the	5
barber	5
was	5
going,	5
carrying	5
with	5
him	5
a	5
brass	5
basin;	5
but	5
as	5
luck	5
would	5
have	5
it,	5
as	5
he	5
was	5
on	5
the	5
way	5
it	5
began	5
to	5
rain,	5
and	5
not	5
to	5
spoil	5
his	5
hat,	5
which	5
probably	5
was	5
a	5
new	5
one,	5
he	5
put	5
the	5
basin	5
on	5
his	5
head,	5
and	5
being	5
clean	5
it	5
glittered	5
at	5
half	5
a	5
league’s	5
distance.	5
He	5
rode	5
upon	5
a	5
grey	5
ass,	5
as	5
Sancho	5
said,	5
and	5
this	5
was	5
what	5
made	5
it	5
seem	5
to	5
Don	5
Quixote	5
to	5
be	5
a	5
dapple-grey	5
steed	5
and	5
a	5
knight	5
and	5
a	5
golden	5
helmet;	5
for	5
everything	5
he	5
saw	5
he	5
made	5
to	5
fall	5
in	5
with	5
his	5
crazy	5
chivalry	5
and	5
ill-errant	5
notions;	5
and	5
when	5
he	5
saw	5
the	5
poor	5
knight	5
draw	5
near,	5
without	5
entering	5
into	5
any	5
parley	5
with	5
him,	5
at	5
Rocinante’s	5
top	5
speed	5
he	5
bore	5
down	5
upon	5
him	5
with	5
the	5
pike	5
pointed	5
low,	5
fully	5
determined	5
to	5
run	5
him	5
through	5
and	5
through,	5
and	5
as	5
he	5
reached	5
him,	5
without	5
checking	5
the	5
fury	5
of	5
his	5
charge,	5
he	5
cried	5
to	5
him:	5
“Defend	5
thyself,	5
miserable	5
being,	5
or	5
yield	5
me	5
of	5
thine	5
own	5
accord	5
that	5
which	5
is	5
so	5
reasonably	5
my	5
due.”	5
The	5
barber,	5
who	5
without	5
any	5
expectation	5
or	5
apprehension	5
of	5
it	5
saw	5
this	5
apparition	5
coming	5
down	5
upon	5
him,	5
had	5
no	5
other	5
way	5
of	5
saving	5
himself	5
from	5
the	5
stroke	5
of	5
the	5
lance	5
but	5
to	5
let	5
himself	5
fall	5
off	5
his	5
ass;	5
and	5
no	5
sooner	5
had	5
he	5
touched	5
the	5
ground	5
than	5
he	5
sprang	5
up	5
more	5
nimbly	5
than	5
a	5
deer	5
and	5
sped	5
away	5
across	5
the	5
plain	5
faster	5
than	5
the	5
wind.	5
He	5
left	5
the	5
basin	5
on	5
the	5
ground,	5
with	5
which	5
Don	5
Quixote	5
contented	5
himself,	5
saying	5
that	5
the	5
pagan	5
had	5
shown	5
his	5
discretion	5
and	5
imitated	5
the	5
beaver,	5
which	5
finding	5
itself	5
pressed	5
by	5
the	5
hunters	5
bites	5
and	5
cuts	5
off	5
with	5
its	5
teeth	5
that	5
for	5
which,	5
by	5
its	5
natural	5
instinct,	5
it	5
knows	5
it	5
is	5
pursued.	5
He	5
told	5
Sancho	5
to	5
pick	5
up	5
the	5
helmet,	5
and	5
he	5
taking	5
it	5
in	5
his	5
hands	5
said:	5
“By	5
God	5
the	5
basin	5
is	5
a	5
good	5
one,	5
and	5
worth	5
a	5
real	5
of	5
eight	5
if	5
it	5
is	5
worth	5
a	5
maravedis,”	5
and	5
handed	5
it	5
to	5
his	5
master,	5
who	5
immediately	5
put	5
it	5
on	5
his	5
head,	5
turning	5
it	5
round,	5
now	5
this	5
way,	5
now	5
that,	5
in	5
search	5
of	5
fitment,	5
and	5
not	5
finding	5
it	5
he	5
said,	5
“Clearly	5
the	5
pagan	5
to	5
whose	5
measure	5
this	5
famous	5
head-piece	5
was	5
first	5
forged	5
must	5
have	5
had	5
a	5
very	5
large	5
head;	5
but	5
the	5
worst	5
of	5
it	5
is	5
half	5
of	5
it	5
is	5
wanting.”	5
When	5
Sancho	5
heard	5
him	5
call	5
the	5
basin	5
a	5
headpiece	5
he	5
was	5
unable	5
to	5
restrain	5
his	5
laughter,	5
but	5
remembering	5
his	5
master’s	5
wrath	5
he	5
checked	5
himself	5
in	5
the	5
midst	5
of	5
it.	5
“What	5
art	5
thou	5
laughing	5
at,	5
Sancho?”	5
said	5
Don	5
Quixote.	5
“I	5
am	5
laughing,”	5
said	5
he,	5
“to	5
think	5
of	5
the	5
great	5
head	5
the	5
pagan	5
must	5
have	5
had	5
who	5
owned	5
this	5
helmet,	5
for	5
it	5
looks	5
exactly	5
like	5
a	5
regular	5
barber’s	5
basin.”	5
“Dost	5
thou	5
know	5
what	5
I	5
suspect,	5
Sancho?”	5
said	5
Don	5
Quixote;	5
“that	5
this	5
wonderful	5
piece	5
of	5
this	5
enchanted	5
helmet	5
must	5
by	5
some	5
strange	5
accident	5
have	5
come	5
into	5
the	5
hands	5
of	5
someone	5
who	5
was	5
unable	5
to	5
recognise	5
or	5
realise	5
its	5
value,	5
and	5
who,	5
not	5
knowing	5
what	5
he	5
did,	5
and	5
seeing	5
it	5
to	5
be	5
of	5
the	5
purest	5
gold,	5
must	5
have	5
melted	5
down	5
one	5
half	5
for	5
the	5
sake	5
of	5
what	5
it	5
might	5
be	5
worth,	5
and	5
of	5
the	5
other	5
made	5
this	5
which	5
is	5
like	5
a	5
barber’s	5
basin	5
as	5
thou	5
sayest;	5
but	5
be	5
it	5
as	5
it	5
may,	5
to	5
me	5
who	5
recognise	5
it,	5
its	5
transformation	5
makes	5
no	5
difference,	5
for	5
I	5
will	5
set	5
it	5
to	5
rights	5
at	5
the	5
first	5
village	5
where	5
there	5
is	5
a	5
blacksmith,	5
and	5
in	5
such	5
style	5
that	6
helmet	6
the	6
god	6
of	6
smithies	6
forged	6
for	6
the	6
god	6
of	6
battles	6
shall	6
not	6
surpass	6
it	6
or	6
even	6
come	6
up	6
to	6
it;	6
and	6
in	6
the	6
meantime	6
I	6
will	6
wear	6
it	6
as	6
well	6
as	6
I	6
can,	6
for	6
something	6
is	6
better	6
than	6
nothing;	6
all	6
the	6
more	6
as	6
it	6
will	6
be	6
quite	6
enough	6
to	6
protect	6
me	6
from	6
any	6
chance	6
blow	6
of	6
a	6
stone.”	6
“That	6
is,”	6
said	6
Sancho,	6
“if	6
it	6
is	6
not	6
shot	6
with	6
a	6
sling	6
as	6
they	6
were	6
in	6
the	6
battle	6
of	6
the	6
two	6
armies,	6
when	6
they	6
signed	6
the	6
cross	6
on	6
your	6
worship’s	6
grinders	6
and	6
smashed	6
the	6
flask	6
with	6
that	6
blessed	6
draught	6
that	6
made	6
me	6
vomit	6
my	6
bowels	6
up.”	6
“It	6
does	6
not	6
grieve	6
me	6
much	6
to	6
have	6
lost	6
it,”	6
said	6
Don	6
Quixote,	6
“for	6
thou	6
knowest,	6
Sancho,	6
that	6
I	6
have	6
the	6
receipt	6
in	6
my	6
memory.”	6
“So	6
have	6
I,”	6
answered	6
Sancho,	6
“but	6
if	6
ever	6
I	6
make	6
it,	6
or	6
try	6
it	6
again	6
as	6
long	6
as	6
I	6
live,	6
may	6
this	6
be	6
my	6
last	6
hour;	6
moreover,	6
I	6
have	6
no	6
intention	6
of	6
putting	6
myself	6
in	6
the	6
way	6
of	6
wanting	6
it,	6
for	6
I	6
mean,	6
with	6
all	6
my	6
five	6
senses,	6
to	6
keep	6
myself	6
from	6
being	6
wounded	6
or	6
from	6
wounding	6
anyone:	6
as	6
to	6
being	6
blanketed	6
again	6
I	6
say	6
nothing,	6
for	6
it	6
is	6
hard	6
to	6
prevent	6
mishaps	6
of	6
that	6
sort,	6
and	6
if	6
they	6
come	6
there	6
is	6
nothing	6
for	6
it	6
but	6
to	6
squeeze	6
our	6
shoulders	6
together,	6
hold	6
our	6
breath,	6
shut	6
our	6
eyes,	6
and	6
let	6
ourselves	6
go	6
where	6
luck	6
and	6
the	6
blanket	6
may	6
send	6
us.”	6
“Thou	6
art	6
a	6
bad	6
Christian,	6
Sancho,”	6
said	6
Don	6
Quixote	6
on	6
hearing	6
this,	6
“for	6
once	6
an	6
injury	6
has	6
been	6
done	6
thee	6
thou	6
never	6
forgettest	6
it:	6
but	6
know	6
that	6
it	6
is	6
the	6
part	6
of	6
noble	6
and	6
generous	6
hearts	6
not	6
to	6
attach	6
importance	6
to	6
trifles.	6
What	6
lame	6
leg	6
hast	6
thou	6
got	6
by	6
it,	6
what	6
broken	6
rib,	6
what	6
cracked	6
head,	6
that	6
thou	6
canst	6
not	6
forget	6
that	6
jest?	6
For	6
jest	6
and	6
sport	6
it	6
was,	6
properly	6
regarded,	6
and	6
had	6
I	6
not	6
seen	6
it	6
in	6
that	6
light	6
I	6
would	6
have	6
returned	6
and	6
done	6
more	6
mischief	6
in	6
revenging	6
thee	6
than	6
the	6
Greeks	6
did	6
for	6
the	6
rape	6
of	6
Helen,	6
who,	6
if	6
she	6
were	6
alive	6
now,	6
or	6
if	6
my	6
Dulcinea	6
had	6
lived	6
then,	6
might	6
depend	6
upon	6
it	6
she	6
would	6
not	6
be	6
so	6
famous	6
for	6
her	6
beauty	6
as	6
she	6
is;”	6
and	6
here	6
he	6
heaved	6
a	6
sigh	6
and	6
sent	6
it	6
aloft;	6
and	6
said	6
Sancho,	6
“Let	6
it	6
pass	6
for	6
a	6
jest	6
as	6
it	6
cannot	6
be	6
revenged	6
in	6
earnest,	6
but	6
I	6
know	6
what	6
sort	6
of	6
jest	6
and	6
earnest	6
it	6
was,	6
and	6
I	6
know	6
it	6
will	6
never	6
be	6
rubbed	6
out	6
of	6
my	6
memory	6
any	6
more	6
than	6
off	6
my	6
shoulders.	6
But	6
putting	6
that	6
aside,	6
will	6
your	6
worship	6
tell	6
me	6
what	6
are	6
we	6
to	6
do	6
with	6
this	6
dapple-grey	6
steed	6
that	6
looks	6
like	6
a	6
grey	6
ass,	6
which	6
that	6
Martino	6
that	6
your	6
worship	6
overthrew	6
has	6
left	6
deserted	6
here?	6
for,	6
from	6
the	6
way	6
he	6
took	6
to	6
his	6
heels	6
and	6
bolted,	6
he	6
is	6
not	6
likely	6
ever	6
to	6
come	6
back	6
for	6
it;	6
and	6
by	6
my	6
beard	6
but	6
the	6
grey	6
is	6
a	6
good	6
one.”	6
“I	6
have	6
never	6
been	6
in	6
the	6
habit,”	6
said	6
Don	6
Quixote,	6
“of	6
taking	6
spoil	6
of	6
those	6
whom	6
I	6
vanquish,	6
nor	6
is	6
it	6
the	6
practice	6
of	6
chivalry	6
to	6
take	6
away	6
their	6
horses	6
and	6
leave	6
them	6
to	6
go	6
on	6
foot,	6
unless	6
indeed	6
it	6
be	6
that	6
the	6
victor	6
have	6
lost	6
his	6
own	6
in	6
the	6
combat,	6
in	6
which	6
case	6
it	6
is	6
lawful	6
to	6
take	6
that	6
of	6
the	6
vanquished	6
as	6
a	6
thing	6
won	6
in	6
lawful	6
war;	6
therefore,	6
Sancho,	6
leave	6
this	6
horse,	6
or	6
ass,	6
or	6
whatever	6
thou	6
wilt	6
have	6
it	6
to	6
be;	6
for	6
when	6
its	6
owner	6
sees	6
us	6
gone	6
hence	6
he	6
will	6
come	6
back	6
for	6
it.”	6
“God	6
knows	6
I	6
should	6
like	6
to	6
take	6
it,”	6
returned	6
Sancho,	6
“or	6
at	6
least	6
to	6
change	6
it	6
for	6
my	6
own,	6
which	6
does	6
not	6
seem	6
to	6
me	6
as	6
good	6
a	6
one:	6
verily	6
the	6
laws	6
of	6
chivalry	6
are	6
strict,	6
since	6
they	6
cannot	6
be	6
stretched	6
to	6
let	6
one	6
ass	6
be	6
changed	6
for	6
another;	6
I	6
should	6
like	6
to	6
know	6
if	6
I	6
might	6
at	6
least	6
change	6
trappings.”	6
“On	6
that	6
head	6
I	6
am	6
not	6
quite	6
certain,”	6
answered	6
Don	6
Quixote,	6
“and	6
the	6
matter	6
being	6
doubtful,	6
pending	6
better	6
information,	6
I	6
say	6
thou	6
mayest	6
change	6
them,	6
if	6
so	6
be	6
thou	6
hast	6
urgent	6
need	6
of	6
them.”	6
“So	6
urgent	6
is	6
it,”	6
answered	6
Sancho,	6
“that	6
if	6
they	6
were	6
for	6
my	6
own	6
person	6
I	6
could	6
not	6
want	6
them	6
more;”	6
and	6
forthwith,	6
fortified	6
by	6
this	6
licence,	6
he	6
effected	6
the	6
_mutatio	6
capparum_,	6
and	6
rigged	6
out	6
his	6
beast	6
to	6
the	6
ninety-nines	6
and	6
making	6
quite	6
another	6
thing	6
of	6
it.	6
This	6
done,	6
they	6
broke	6
their	6
fast	6
on	6
the	6
remains	6
of	6
the	6
spoils	6
of	6
war	6
plundered	6
from	6
the	6
sumpter	6
mule,	6
and	6
drank	6
of	6
the	6
brook	6
that	6
flowed	6
from	6
the	6
fulling	6
mills,	6
without	6
casting	6
a	6
look	6
in	6
that	6
direction,	6
in	6
such	6
loathing	6
did	6
they	6
hold	6
them	6
for	6
the	6
alarm	6
they	6
had	6
caused	6
them;	6
and,	6
all	6
anger	6
and	6
gloom	6
removed,	6
they	6
mounted	6
and,	6
without	6
taking	6
any	6
fixed	6
road	6
(not	6
to	6
fix	6
upon	6
any	6
being	6
the	6
proper	6
thing	6
for	6
true	6
knights-errant),	6
they	6
set	6
out,	6
guided	6
by	6
Rocinante’s	6
will,	6
which	6
carried	6
along	6
with	6
it	6
that	6
of	6
his	6
master,	6
not	6
to	6
say	6
that	6
of	6
the	6
ass,	6
which	6
always	6
followed	6
him	6
wherever	6
he	6
led,	6
lovingly	6
and	6
sociably;	6
nevertheless	6
they	6
returned	6
to	6
the	6
high	6
road,	6
and	6
pursued	6
it	6
at	6
a	6
venture	6
without	6
any	6
other	6
aim.	6
As	6
they	6
went	6
along,	6
then,	6
in	6
this	6
way	6
Sancho	6
said	6
to	6
his	6
master,	6
“Señor,	6
would	6
your	6
worship	6
give	6
me	6
leave	6
to	6
speak	6
a	6
little	6
to	6
you?	6
For	6
since	6
you	6
laid	6
that	6
hard	6
injunction	6
of	6
silence	6
on	6
me	6
several	6
things	6
have	6
gone	6
to	6
rot	6
in	6
my	6
stomach,	6
and	6
I	6
have	6
now	6
just	6
one	6
on	6
the	6
tip	6
of	6
my	6
tongue	6
that	6
I	6
don’t	6
want	6
to	6
be	6
spoiled.”	6
“Say,	6
on,	6
Sancho,”	6
said	6
Don	6
Quixote,	6
“and	6
be	6
brief	6
in	6
thy	6
discourse,	6
for	6
there	6
is	6
no	6
pleasure	6
in	6
one	6
that	6
is	6
long.”	6
“Well	6
then,	6
señor,”	6
returned	6
Sancho,	6
“I	6
say	6
that	6
for	6
some	6
days	6
past	6
I	6
have	6
been	6
considering	6
how	6
little	6
is	6
got	6
or	6
gained	6
by	6
going	6
in	6
search	6
of	6
these	6
adventures	6
that	6
your	6
worship	6
seeks	6
in	6
these	6
wilds	6
and	6
cross-roads,	6
where,	6
even	6
if	6
the	6
most	6
perilous	6
are	6
victoriously	6
achieved,	6
there	6
is	6
no	6
one	6
to	6
see	6
or	6
know	6
of	6
them,	6
and	6
so	6
they	6
must	6
be	6
left	6
untold	6
for	6
ever,	6
to	6
the	6
loss	6
of	6
your	6
worship’s	6
object	6
and	6
the	6
credit	6
they	6
deserve;	6
therefore	6
it	6
seems	6
to	6
me	6
it	6
would	6
be	6
better	6
(saving	6
your	6
worship’s	6
better	6
judgment)	6
if	6
we	6
were	6
to	6
go	6
and	6
serve	6
some	6
emperor	6
or	6
other	6
great	6
prince	6
who	6
may	6
have	6
some	6
war	6
on	6
hand,	6
in	6
whose	6
service	6
your	6
worship	6
may	6
prove	6
the	6
worth	6
of	6
your	6
person,	6
your	6
great	6
might,	6
and	6
greater	6
understanding,	6
on	6
perceiving	6
which	6
the	6
lord	6
in	6
whose	6
service	6
we	6
may	6
be	6
will	6
perforce	6
have	6
to	6
reward	6
us,	6
each	6
according	6
to	6
his	6
merits;	6
and	6
there	6
you	6
will	6
not	6
be	6
at	6
a	6
loss	6
for	6
someone	6
to	6
set	6
down	6
your	6
achievements	6
in	6
writing	6
so	6
as	6
to	6
preserve	6
their	6
memory	6
for	6
ever.	6
Of	6
my	6
own	6
I	6
say	6
nothing,	6
as	6
they	6
will	6
not	6
go	6
beyond	6
squirely	6
limits,	6
though	6
I	6
make	6
bold	6
to	6
say	6
that,	6
if	6
it	6
be	6
the	6
practice	6
in	6
chivalry	6
to	6
write	6
the	6
achievements	6
of	6
squires,	6
I	6
think	6
mine	6
must	6
not	6
be	6
left	6
out.”	6
“Thou	6
speakest	6
not	6
amiss,	6
Sancho,”	6
answered	6
Don	6
Quixote,	6
“but	6
before	6
that	6
point	6
is	6
reached	6
it	6
is	6
requisite	6
to	6
roam	6
the	6
world,	6
as	6
it	6
were	6
on	6
probation,	6
seeking	6
adventures,	6
in	6
order	6
that,	6
by	6
achieving	6
some,	6
name	6
and	6
fame	6
may	6
be	6
acquired,	6
such	6
that	6
when	6
he	6
betakes	6
himself	6
to	6
the	6
court	6
of	6
some	6
great	6
monarch	6
the	6
knight	6
may	6
be	6
already	6
known	6
by	6
his	6
deeds,	6
and	6
that	6
the	6
boys,	6
the	6
instant	6
they	6
see	6
him	6
enter	6
the	6
gate	6
of	6
the	6
city,	6
may	6
all	6
follow	6
him	6
and	6
surround	6
him,	6
crying,	6
‘This	6
is	6
the	6
Knight	6
of	6
the	6
Sun’—or	6
the	6
Serpent,	6
or	6
any	6
other	6
title	6
under	6
which	6
he	6
may	6
have	6
achieved	6
great	6
deeds.	6
‘This,’	6
they	6
will	6
say,	6
‘is	6
he	6
who	6
vanquished	6
in	6
single	6
combat	6
the	6
gigantic	6
Brocabruno	6
of	6
mighty	6
strength;	6
he	6
who	6
delivered	6
the	6
great	6
Mameluke	6
of	6
Persia	6
out	6
of	6
the	6
long	6
enchantment	6
under	6
which	6
he	6
had	6
been	6
for	6
almost	6
nine	6
hundred	6
years.’	6
So	6
from	6
one	6
to	6
another	6
they	6
will	6
go	6
proclaiming	6
his	6
achievements;	6
and	6
presently	6
at	6
the	6
tumult	6
of	6
the	6
boys	6
and	6
the	6
others	6
the	6
king	6
of	6
that	6
kingdom	6
will	6
appear	6
at	6
the	6
windows	6
of	6
his	6
royal	6
palace,	6
and	6
as	6
soon	6
as	6
he	6
beholds	6
the	6
knight,	6
recognising	6
him	6
by	6
his	6
arms	6
and	6
the	6
device	6
on	6
his	6
shield,	6
he	6
will	6
as	6
a	6
matter	6
of	6
course	6
say,	6
‘What	6
ho!	6
Forth	6
all	6
ye,	6
the	6
knights	6
of	6
my	6
court,	6
to	6
receive	6
the	6
flower	6
of	6
chivalry	6
who	6
cometh	6
hither!’	6
At	6
which	6
command	6
all	6
will	6
issue	6
forth,	6
and	6
he	6
himself,	6
advancing	6
half-way	6
down	6
the	6
stairs,	6
will	6
embrace	6
him	6
closely,	6
and	6
salute	6
him,	6
kissing	6
him	6
on	6
the	6
cheek,	6
and	6
will	6
then	6
lead	6
him	6
to	6
the	6
queen’s	6
chamber,	6
where	6
the	6
knight	6
will	6
find	6
her	6
with	6
the	6
princess	6
her	6
daughter,	6
who	6
will	6
be	6
one	6
of	6
the	6
most	6
beautiful	6
and	6
accomplished	6
damsels	6
that	6
could	6
with	6
the	6
utmost	6
pains	6
be	6
discovered	6
anywhere	6
in	6
the	6
known	6
world.	6
Straightway	6
it	6
will	6
come	6
to	6
pass	6
that	6
she	6
will	6
fix	6
her	6
eyes	6
upon	6
the	6
knight	6
and	6
he	6
his	6
upon	6
her,	6
and	6
each	6
will	6
seem	6
to	6
the	6
other	6
something	6
more	6
divine	6
than	6
human,	6
and,	6
without	6
knowing	6
how	6
or	6
why	6
they	6
will	6
be	6
taken	6
and	6
entangled	6
in	6
the	6
inextricable	6
toils	6
of	6
love,	6
and	6
sorely	6
distressed	6
in	6
their	6
hearts	6
not	6
to	6
see	6
any	6
way	6
of	6
making	6
their	6
pains	6
and	6
sufferings	6
known	6
by	6
speech.	6
Thence	6
they	6
will	6
lead	6
him,	6
no	6
doubt,	6
to	6
some	6
richly	6
adorned	6
chamber	6
of	6
the	6
palace,	6
where,	6
having	6
removed	6
his	6
armour,	6
they	6
will	6
bring	6
him	6
a	6
rich	6
mantle	6
of	6
scarlet	6
wherewith	6
to	6
robe	6
himself,	6
and	6
if	6
he	6
looked	6
noble	6
in	6
his	6
armour	6
he	6
will	6
look	6
still	6
more	6
so	6
in	6
a	6
doublet.	6
When	6
night	6
comes	6
he	6
will	6
sup	6
with	6
the	6
king,	6
queen,	6
and	6
princess;	6
and	6
all	6
the	6
time	6
he	6
will	6
never	6
take	6
his	6
eyes	6
off	6
her,	6
stealing	6
stealthy	6
glances,	6
unnoticed	6
by	6
those	6
present,	6
and	6
she	6
will	6
do	6
the	6
same,	6
and	6
with	6
equal	6
cautiousness,	6
being,	6
as	6
I	6
have	6
said,	6
a	6
damsel	6
of	6
great	6
discretion.	6
The	6
tables	6
being	6
removed,	6
suddenly	6
through	6
the	6
door	6
of	6
the	6
hall	6
there	6
will	6
enter	6
a	6
hideous	6
and	6
diminutive	6
dwarf	6
followed	6
by	6
a	6
fair	6
dame,	6
between	6
two	6
giants,	6
who	6
comes	6
with	6
a	6
certain	6
adventure,	6
the	6
work	6
of	6
an	6
ancient	6
sage;	6
and	6
he	6
who	6
shall	6
achieve	6
it	6
shall	6
be	6
deemed	6
the	6
best	6
knight	6
in	6
the	6
world.	6
“The	6
king	6
will	6
then	6
command	6
all	6
those	6
present	6
to	6
essay	6
it,	6
and	6
none	6
will	6
bring	6
it	6
to	6
an	6
end	6
and	6
conclusion	6
save	6
the	6
stranger	6
knight,	6
to	6
the	6
great	6
enhancement	6
of	6
his	6
fame,	6
whereat	6
the	6
princess	6
will	6
be	6
overjoyed	6
and	6
will	6
esteem	6
herself	6
happy	6
and	6
fortunate	6
in	6
having	6
fixed	6
and	6
placed	6
her	6
thoughts	6
so	6
high.	6
And	6
the	6
best	6
of	6
it	6
is	6
that	6
this	6
king,	6
or	6
prince,	6
or	6
whatever	6
he	6
is,	6
is	6
engaged	6
in	6
a	6
very	6
bitter	6
war	6
with	6
another	6
as	6
powerful	6
as	6
himself,	6
and	6
the	6
stranger	6
knight,	6
after	6
having	6
been	6
some	6
days	6
at	6
his	6
court,	6
requests	6
leave	6
from	6
him	6
to	6
go	6
and	6
serve	6
him	6
in	6
the	6
said	6
war.	6
The	6
king	6
will	6
grant	6
it	6
very	6
readily,	6
and	6
the	6
knight	6
will	6
courteously	6
kiss	6
his	6
hands	6
for	6
the	6
favour	6
done	6
to	6
him;	6
and	6
that	6
night	6
he	6
will	6
take	6
leave	6
of	6
his	6
lady	6
the	6
princess	6
at	6
the	6
grating	6
of	6
the	6
chamber	6
where	6
she	6
sleeps,	6
which	6
looks	6
upon	6
a	6
garden,	6
and	6
at	6
which	6
he	6
has	6
already	6
many	6
times	6
conversed	6
with	6
her,	6
the	6
go-between	6
and	6
confidante	6
in	6
the	6
matter	6
being	6
a	6
damsel	6
much	6
trusted	6
by	6
the	6
princess.	6
He	6
will	6
sigh,	6
she	6
will	6
swoon,	6
the	6
damsel	6
will	6
fetch	6
water,	6
much	6
distressed	6
because	6
morning	6
approaches,	6
and	6
for	6
the	6
honour	6
of	6
her	6
lady	6
he	6
would	6
not	6
that	6
they	6
were	6
discovered;	6
at	6
last	6
the	6
princess	6
will	6
come	6
to	6
herself	6
and	6
will	6
present	6
her	6
white	6
hands	6
through	6
the	6
grating	6
to	6
the	6
knight,	6
who	6
will	6
kiss	6
them	6
a	6
thousand	6
and	6
a	6
thousand	6
times,	6
bathing	6
them	6
with	6
his	6
tears.	6
It	6
will	6
be	6
arranged	6
between	6
them	6
how	6
they	6
are	6
to	6
inform	6
each	6
other	6
of	6
their	6
good	6
or	6
evil	6
fortunes,	6
and	6
the	6
princess	6
will	6
entreat	6
him	6
to	6
make	6
his	6
absence	6
as	6
short	6
as	6
possible,	6
which	6
he	6
will	6
promise	6
to	6
do	6
with	6
many	6
oaths;	6
once	6
more	6
he	6
kisses	6
her	6
hands,	6
and	6
takes	6
his	6
leave	6
in	6
such	6
grief	6
that	6
he	6
is	6
well-nigh	6
ready	6
to	6
die.	6
He	6
betakes	6
him	6
thence	6
to	6
his	6
chamber,	6
flings	6
himself	6
on	6
his	6
bed,	6
cannot	6
sleep	6
for	6
sorrow	6
at	6
parting,	6
rises	6
early	6
in	6
the	6
morning,	6
goes	6
to	6
take	6
leave	6
of	6
the	6
king,	6
queen,	6
and	6
princess,	6
and,	6
as	6
he	6
takes	6
his	6
leave	6
of	6
the	6
pair,	6
it	6
is	6
told	6
him	6
that	6
the	6
princess	6
is	6
indisposed	6
and	6
cannot	6
receive	6
a	6
visit;	6
the	6
knight	6
thinks	6
it	6
is	6
from	6
grief	6
at	6
his	6
departure,	6
his	6
heart	6
is	6
pierced,	6
and	6
he	6
is	6
hardly	6
able	6
to	6
keep	6
from	6
showing	6
his	6
pain.	6
The	6
confidante	6
is	6
present,	6
observes	6
all,	6
goes	6
to	6
tell	6
her	6
mistress,	6
who	6
listens	6
with	6
tears	6
and	6
says	6
that	6
one	6
of	6
her	6
greatest	6
distresses	6
is	6
not	6
knowing	6
who	6
this	6
knight	6
is,	6
and	6
whether	6
he	6
is	6
of	6
kingly	6
lineage	6
or	6
not;	6
the	6
damsel	6
assures	6
her	6
that	6
so	6
much	6
courtesy,	6
gentleness,	6
and	6
gallantry	6
of	6
bearing	6
as	6
her	6
knight	6
possesses	6
could	6
not	6
exist	6
in	6
any	6
save	6
one	6
who	6
was	6
royal	6
and	6
illustrious;	6
her	6
anxiety	6
is	6
thus	6
relieved,	6
and	6
she	6
strives	6
to	6
be	6
of	6
good	6
cheer	6
lest	6
she	6
should	6
excite	6
suspicion	6
in	6
her	6
parents,	6
and	6
at	6
the	6
end	6
of	6
two	6
days	6
she	6
appears	6
in	6
public.	6
Meanwhile	6
the	6
knight	6
has	6
taken	6
his	6
departure;	6
he	6
fights	6
in	6
the	6
war,	6
conquers	6
the	6
king’s	6
enemy,	6
wins	6
many	6
cities,	6
triumphs	6
in	6
many	6
battles,	6
returns	6
to	6
the	6
court,	6
sees	6
his	6
lady	6
where	6
he	6
was	6
wont	6
to	6
see	6
her,	6
and	6
it	6
is	6
agreed	6
that	6
he	6
shall	6
demand	6
her	6
in	6
marriage	6
of	6
her	6
parents	6
as	6
the	6
reward	6
of	6
his	6
services;	6
the	6
king	6
is	6
unwilling	6
to	6
give	6
her,	6
as	6
he	6
knows	6
not	6
who	6
he	6
is,	6
but	6
nevertheless,	6
whether	6
carried	6
off	6
or	6
in	6
whatever	6
other	6
way	6
it	6
may	6
be,	6
the	6
princess	6
comes	6
to	6
be	6
his	6
bride,	6
and	6
her	6
father	6
comes	6
to	6
regard	6
it	6
as	6
very	6
good	6
fortune;	6
for	6
it	6
so	6
happens	6
that	6
this	6
knight	6
is	6
proved	6
to	6
be	6
the	6
son	6
of	6
a	6
valiant	6
king	6
of	6
some	6
kingdom,	6
I	6
know	6
not	6
what,	6
for	6
I	6
fancy	6
it	6
is	6
not	6
likely	6
to	6
be	6
on	6
the	6
map.	6
The	6
father	6
dies,	6
the	6
princess	6
inherits,	6
and	6
in	6
two	6
words	6
the	6
knight	6
becomes	6
king.	6
And	6
here	6
comes	6
in	6
at	6
once	6
the	6
bestowal	6
of	6
rewards	6
upon	6
his	6
squire	6
and	6
all	6
who	6
have	6
aided	6
him	6
in	6
rising	6
to	6
so	6
exalted	6
a	6
rank.	6
He	6
marries	6
his	6
squire	6
to	6
a	6
damsel	6
of	6
the	6
princess’s,	6
who	6
will	6
be,	6
no	6
doubt,	6
the	6
one	6
who	6
was	6
confidante	6
in	6
their	6
amour,	6
and	6
is	6
daughter	6
of	6
a	6
very	6
great	6
duke.”	6
“That’s	6
what	6
I	6
want,	6
and	6
no	6
mistake	6
about	6
it!”	6
said	6
Sancho.	6
“That’s	6
what	6
I’m	6
waiting	6
for;	6
for	6
all	6
this,	6
word	6
for	6
word,	6
is	6
in	6
store	6
for	6
your	6
worship	6
under	6
the	6
title	6
of	6
the	6
Knight	6
of	6
the	6
Rueful	6
Countenance.”	6
“Thou	6
needst	6
not	6
doubt	6
it,	6
Sancho,”	6
replied	6
Don	6
Quixote,	6
“for	6
in	6
the	6
same	6
manner,	6
and	6
by	6
the	6
same	6
steps	6
as	6
I	6
have	6
described	6
here,	6
knights-errant	6
rise	6
and	6
have	6
risen	6
to	6
be	6
kings	6
and	6
emperors;	6
all	6
we	6
want	6
now	6
is	6
to	6
find	6
out	6
what	6
king,	6
Christian	6
or	6
pagan,	6
is	6
at	6
war	6
and	6
has	6
a	6
beautiful	6
daughter;	6
but	6
there	6
will	6
be	6
time	6
enough	6
to	6
think	6
of	6
that,	6
for,	6
as	6
I	6
have	6
told	6
thee,	6
fame	6
must	6
be	6
won	6
in	6
other	6
quarters	6
before	6
repairing	6
to	6
the	6
court.	6
There	6
is	6
another	6
thing,	6
too,	6
that	6
is	6
wanting;	6
for	6
supposing	6
we	6
find	6
a	6
king	6
who	6
is	6
at	6
war	6
and	6
has	6
a	6
beautiful	6
daughter,	6
and	6
that	6
I	6
have	6
won	6
incredible	6
fame	6
throughout	6
the	6
universe,	6
I	6
know	6
not	6
how	6
it	6
can	6
be	6
made	6
out	6
that	6
I	6
am	6
of	6
royal	6
lineage,	6
or	6
even	6
second	6
cousin	6
to	6
an	6
emperor;	6
for	6
the	6
king	6
will	6
not	6
be	6
willing	6
to	6
give	6
me	6
his	6
daughter	6
in	6
marriage	6
unless	6
he	6
is	6
first	6
thoroughly	6
satisfied	6
on	6
this	6
point,	6
however	6
much	6
my	6
famous	6
deeds	6
may	6
deserve	6
it;	6
so	6
that	6
by	6
this	6
deficiency	6
I	6
fear	6
I	6
shall	6
lose	6
what	6
my	6
arm	6
has	6
fairly	6
earned.	6
True	6
it	6
is	6
I	6
am	6
a	6
gentleman	6
of	6
known	6
house,	6
of	6
estate	6
and	6
property,	6
and	6
entitled	6
to	6
the	6
five	6
hundred	6
sueldos	6
mulet;	6
and	6
it	6
may	6
be	6
that	6
the	6
sage	6
who	6
shall	6
write	6
my	6
history	6
will	6
so	6
clear	6
up	6
my	6
ancestry	6
and	6
pedigree	6
that	6
I	6
may	6
find	6
myself	6
fifth	6
or	6
sixth	6
in	6
descent	6
from	6
a	6
king;	6
for	6
I	6
would	6
have	6
thee	6
know,	6
Sancho,	6
that	6
there	6
are	6
two	6
kinds	6
of	6
lineages	6
in	6
the	6
world;	6
some	6
there	6
be	6
tracing	6
and	6
deriving	6
their	6
descent	6
from	6
kings	6
and	6
princes,	6
whom	6
time	6
has	6
reduced	6
little	6
by	6
little	6
until	6
they	6
end	6
in	6
a	6
point	6
like	6
a	6
pyramid	6
upside	6
down;	6
and	6
others	6
who	6
spring	6
from	6
the	6
common	6
herd	6
and	6
go	6
on	6
rising	6
step	6
by	6
step	6
until	6
they	6
come	6
to	6
be	6
great	6
lords;	6
so	6
that	6
the	6
difference	6
is	6
that	6
the	6
one	6
were	6
what	6
they	6
no	6
longer	6
are,	6
and	6
the	6
others	6
are	6
what	6
they	6
formerly	6
were	6
not.	6
And	6
I	6
may	6
be	6
of	6
such	6
that	6
after	6
investigation	6
my	6
origin	6
may	6
prove	6
great	6
and	6
famous,	6
with	6
which	6
the	6
king,	6
my	6
father-in-law	6
that	6
is	6
to	6
be,	6
ought	6
to	6
be	6
satisfied;	6
and	6
should	6
he	6
not	6
be,	6
the	6
princess	6
will	6
so	6
love	6
me	6
that	6
even	6
though	6
she	6
well	6
knew	6
me	6
to	6
be	6
the	6
son	6
of	6
a	6
water-carrier,	6
she	6
will	6
take	6
me	6
for	6
her	6
lord	6
and	6
husband	6
in	6
spite	6
of	6
her	6
father;	6
if	6
not,	6
then	6
it	6
comes	6
to	6
seizing	6
her	6
and	6
carrying	6
her	6
off	6
where	6
I	6
please;	6
for	6
time	6
or	6
death	6
will	6
put	6
an	6
end	6
to	6
the	6
wrath	6
of	6
her	6
parents.”	6
“It	6
comes	6
to	6
this,	6
too,”	6
said	6
Sancho,	6
“what	6
some	6
naughty	6
people	6
say,	6
‘Never	6
ask	6
as	6
a	6
favour	6
what	6
thou	6
canst	6
take	6
by	6
force;’	6
though	6
it	6
would	6
fit	6
better	6
to	6
say,	6
‘A	6
clear	6
escape	6
is	6
better	6
than	6
good	6
men’s	6
prayers.’	6
I	6
say	6
so	6
because	6
if	6
my	6
lord	6
the	6
king,	6
your	6
worship’s	6
father-in-law,	6
will	6
not	6
condescend	6
to	6
give	6
you	6
my	6
lady	6
the	6
princess,	6
there	6
is	6
nothing	6
for	6
it	6
but,	6
as	6
your	6
worship	6
says,	6
to	6
seize	6
her	6
and	6
transport	6
her.	6
But	6
the	6
mischief	6
is	6
that	6
until	6
peace	6
is	6
made	6
and	6
you	6
come	6
into	6
the	6
peaceful	6
enjoyment	6
of	6
your	6
kingdom,	6
the	6
poor	6
squire	6
is	6
famishing	6
as	6
far	6
as	6
rewards	6
go,	6
unless	6
it	6
be	6
that	6
the	6
confidante	6
damsel	6
that	6
is	6
to	6
be	6
his	6
wife	6
comes	6
with	6
the	6
princess,	6
and	6
that	6
with	6
her	6
he	6
tides	6
over	6
his	6
bad	6
luck	6
until	6
Heaven	6
otherwise	6
orders	6
things;	6
for	6
his	6
master,	6
I	6
suppose,	6
may	6
as	6
well	6
give	6
her	6
to	6
him	6
at	6
once	6
for	6
a	6
lawful	6
wife.”	6
“Nobody	6
can	6
object	6
to	6
that,”	6
said	6
Don	6
Quixote.	6
“Then	6
since	6
that	6
may	6
be,”	6
said	6
Sancho,	6
“there	6
is	6
nothing	6
for	6
it	6
but	6
to	6
commend	6
ourselves	6
to	6
God,	6
and	6
let	6
fortune	6
take	6
what	6
course	6
it	6
will.”	6
“God	6
guide	6
it	6
according	6
to	6
my	6
wishes	6
and	6
thy	6
wants,”	6
said	6
Don	6
Quixote,	6
“and	6
mean	6
be	6
he	6
who	6
thinks	6
himself	6
mean.”	6
“In	6
God’s	6
name	6
let	6
him	6
be	6
so,”	6
said	6
Sancho:	6
“I	6
am	6
an	6
old	6
Christian,	6
and	6
to	6
fit	6
me	6
for	6
a	6
count	6
that’s	6
enough.”	6
“And	6
more	6
than	6
enough	6
for	6
thee,”	6
said	6
Don	6
Quixote;	6
“and	6
even	6
wert	6
thou	6
not,	6
it	6
would	6
make	6
no	6
difference,	6
because	6
I	6
being	6
the	6
king	6
can	6
easily	6
give	6
thee	6
nobility	6
without	6
purchase	6
or	6
service	6
rendered	6
by	6
thee,	6
for	6
when	6
I	6
make	6
thee	6
a	6
count,	6
then	6
thou	6
art	6
at	6
once	6
a	6
gentleman;	6
and	6
they	6
may	6
say	6
what	6
they	6
will,	6
but	6
by	6
my	6
faith	6
they	6
will	6
have	6
to	6
call	6
thee	6
‘your	6
lordship,’	6
whether	6
they	6
like	6
it	6
or	6
not.”	6
“Not	6
a	6
doubt	6
of	6
it;	6
and	6
I’ll	6
know	6
how	6
to	6
support	6
the	6
tittle,”	6
said	6
Sancho.	6
“Title	6
thou	6
shouldst	6
say,	6
not	6
tittle,”	6
said	6
his	6
master.	6
“So	6
be	6
it,”	6
answered	6
Sancho.	6
“I	6
say	6
I	6
will	6
know	6
how	6
to	6
behave,	6
for	6
once	6
in	6
my	6
life	6
I	6
was	6
beadle	6
of	6
a	6
brotherhood,	6
and	6
the	6
beadle’s	6
gown	6
sat	6
so	6
well	6
on	6
me	6
that	6
all	6
said	6
I	6
looked	6
as	6
if	6
I	6
was	6
to	6
be	6
steward	6
of	6
the	6
same	6
brotherhood.	6
What	6
will	6
it	6
be,	6
then,	6
when	6
I	6
put	6
a	6
duke’s	6
robe	6
on	6
my	6
back,	6
or	6
dress	6
myself	6
in	6
gold	6
and	6
pearls	6
like	6
a	6
count?	6
I	6
believe	6
they’ll	6
come	6
a	6
hundred	6
leagues	6
to	6
see	6
me.”	6
“Thou	6
wilt	6
look	6
well,”	6
said	6
Don	6
Quixote,	6
“but	6
thou	6
must	6
shave	6
thy	6
beard	6
often,	6
for	6
thou	6
hast	6
it	6
so	6
thick	6
and	6
rough	6
and	6
unkempt,	6
that	6
if	6
thou	6
dost	6
not	6
shave	6
it	6
every	6
second	6
day	6
at	6
least,	6
they	6
will	6
see	6
what	6
thou	6
art	6
at	6
the	6
distance	6
of	6
a	6
musket	6
shot.”	6
“What	6
more	6
will	6
it	6
be,”	6
said	6
Sancho,	6
“than	6
having	6
a	6
barber,	6
and	6
keeping	6
him	6
at	6
wages	6
in	6
the	6
house?	6
and	6
even	6
if	6
it	6
be	6
necessary,	6
I	6
will	6
make	6
him	6
go	6
behind	6
me	6
like	6
a	6
nobleman’s	6
equerry.”	6
“Why,	6
how	6
dost	6
thou	6
know	6
that	6
noblemen	6
have	6
equerries	6
behind	6
them?”	6
asked	6
Don	6
Quixote.	6
“I	6
will	6
tell	6
you,”	6
answered	6
Sancho.	6
“Years	6
ago	6
I	6
was	6
for	6
a	6
month	6
at	6
the	6
capital	6
and	6
there	6
I	6
saw	6
taking	6
the	6
air	6
a	6
very	6
small	6
gentleman	6
who	6
they	6
said	6
was	6
a	6
very	6
great	6
man,	6
and	6
a	6
man	6
following	6
him	6
on	6
horseback	6
in	6
every	6
turn	6
he	6
took,	6
just	6
as	6
if	6
he	6
was	6
his	6
tail.	6
I	6
asked	6
why	6
this	6
man	6
did	6
not	6
join	6
the	6
other	6
man,	6
instead	6
of	6
always	6
going	6
behind	6
him;	6
they	6
answered	6
me	6
that	6
he	6
was	6
his	6
equerry,	6
and	6
that	6
it	6
was	6
the	6
custom	6
with	6
nobles	6
to	6
have	6
such	6
persons	6
behind	6
them,	6
and	6
ever	6
since	6
then	6
I	6
know	6
it,	6
for	6
I	6
have	6
never	6
forgotten	6
it.”	6
“Thou	6
art	6
right,”	6
said	6
Don	6
Quixote,	6
“and	6
in	6
the	6
same	6
way	6
thou	6
mayest	6
carry	6
thy	6
barber	6
with	6
thee,	6
for	6
customs	6
did	6
not	6
come	6
into	6
use	6
all	6
together,	6
nor	6
were	6
they	6
all	6
invented	6
at	6
once,	6
and	6
thou	6
mayest	6
be	6
the	6
first	6
count	6
to	6
have	6
a	6
barber	6
to	6
follow	6
him;	6
and,	6
indeed,	6
shaving	6
one’s	6
beard	6
is	6
a	6
greater	6
trust	6
than	6
saddling	6
one’s	6
horse.”	6
“Let	6
the	6
barber	6
business	6
be	6
my	6
look-out,”	6
said	6
Sancho;	6
“and	6
your	6
worship’s	6
be	6
it	6
to	6
strive	6
to	6
become	6
a	6
king,	6
and	6
make	6
me	6
a	6
count.”	6
“So	6
it	6
shall	6
be,”	6
answered	6
Don	6
Quixote,	6
and	6
raising	6
his	6
eyes	6
he	6
saw	6
what	6
will	6
be	6
told	6

relates	6
in	6
this	6
most	6
grave,	6
high-sounding,	6
minute,	6
delightful,	6
and	6
original	6
history	6
that	6
after	6
the	6
discussion	6
between	6
the	6
famous	6
Don	6
Quixote	6
of	6
La	6
Mancha	6
and	6
his	6
squire	6
Sancho	6
Panza	6
which	6
is	6
set	6
down	6
at	6
the	6
end	6
of	6
chapter	6
twenty-one,	6
Don	6
Quixote	6
raised	6
his	6
eyes	6
and	6
saw	6
coming	6
along	6
the	6
road	6
he	6
was	6
following	6
some	6
dozen	6
men	6
on	6
foot	6
strung	6
together	6
by	6
the	6
neck,	6
like	6
beads,	6
on	6
a	6
great	6
iron	6
chain,	6
and	6
all	6
with	6
manacles	6
on	6
their	6
hands.	6
With	6
them	6
there	6
came	6
also	6
two	6
men	6
on	6
horseback	6
and	6
two	6
on	6
foot;	6
those	6
on	6
horseback	6
with	6
wheel-lock	6
muskets,	6
those	6
on	6
foot	6
with	6
javelins	6
and	6
swords,	6
and	6
as	6
soon	6
as	6
Sancho	6
saw	6
them	6
he	6
said:	6
“That	6
is	6
a	6
chain	6
of	6
galley	6
slaves,	6
on	6
the	6
way	6
to	6
the	6
galleys	6
by	6
force	6
of	6
the	6
king’s	6
orders.”	6
“How	6
by	6
force?”	6
asked	6
Don	6
Quixote;	6
“is	6
it	6
possible	6
that	6
the	6
king	6
uses	6
force	6
against	6
anyone?”	6
“I	6
do	6
not	6
say	6
that,”	6
answered	6
Sancho,	6
“but	6
that	6
these	6
are	6
people	6
condemned	6
for	6
their	6
crimes	6
to	6
serve	6
by	6
force	6
in	6
the	6
king’s	6
galleys.”	6
“In	6
fact,”	6
replied	6
Don	6
Quixote,	6
“however	6
it	6
may	6
be,	6
these	6
people	6
are	6
going	6
where	6
they	6
are	6
taking	6
them	6
by	6
force,	6
and	6
not	6
of	6
their	6
own	6
will.”	6
“Just	6
so,”	6
said	6
Sancho.	6
“Then	6
if	6
so,”	6
said	6
Don	6
Quixote,	6
“here	6
is	6
a	6
case	6
for	6
the	6
exercise	6
of	6
my	6
office,	6
to	6
put	6
down	6
force	6
and	6
to	6
succour	6
and	6
help	6
the	6
wretched.”	6
“Recollect,	6
your	6
worship,”	6
said	6
Sancho,	6
“Justice,	6
which	6
is	6
the	6
king	6
himself,	6
is	6
not	6
using	6
force	6
or	6
doing	6
wrong	6
to	6
such	6
persons,	6
but	6
punishing	6
them	6
for	6
their	6
crimes.”	6
The	6
chain	6
of	6
galley	6
slaves	6
had	6
by	6
this	6
time	6
come	6
up,	6
and	6
Don	6
Quixote	6
in	6
very	6
courteous	6
language	6
asked	6
those	6
who	6
were	6
in	6
custody	6
of	6
it	6
to	6
be	6
good	6
enough	6
to	6
tell	6
him	6
the	6
reason	6
or	6
reasons	6
for	6
which	6
they	6
were	6
conducting	6
these	6
people	6
in	6
this	6
manner.	6
One	6
of	6
the	6
guards	6
on	6
horseback	6
answered	6
that	6
they	6
were	6
galley	6
slaves	6
belonging	6
to	6
his	6
majesty,	6
that	6
they	6
were	6
going	6
to	6
the	6
galleys,	6
and	6
that	6
was	6
all	6
that	6
was	6
to	6
be	6
said	6
and	6
all	6
he	6
had	6
any	6
business	6
to	6
know.	6

“Nevertheless,”	6
replied	6
Don	6
Quixote,	6
“I	6
should	6
like	6
to	6
know	6
from	6
each	6
of	6
them	6
separately	6
the	6
reason	6
of	6
his	6
misfortune;”	6
to	6
this	6
he	6
added	6
more	6
to	6
the	6
same	6
effect	6
to	6
induce	6
them	6
to	6
tell	6
him	6
what	6
he	6
wanted	6
so	6
civilly	6
that	6
the	6
other	6
mounted	6
guard	6
said	6
to	6
him:	6
“Though	6
we	6
have	6
here	6
the	6
register	6
and	6
certificate	6
of	6
the	6
sentence	6
of	6
every	6
one	6
of	6
these	6
wretches,	6
this	6
is	6
no	6
time	6
to	6
take	6
them	6
out	6
or	6
read	6
them;	6
come	6
and	6
ask	6
themselves;	6
they	6
can	6
tell	6
if	6
they	6
choose,	6
and	6
they	6
will,	6
for	6
these	6
fellows	6
take	6
a	6
pleasure	6
in	6
doing	6
and	6
talking	6
about	6
rascalities.”	6
With	6
this	6
permission,	6
which	6
Don	6
Quixote	6
would	6
have	6
taken	6
even	6
had	6
they	6
not	6
granted	6
it,	6
he	6
approached	6
the	6
chain	6
and	6
asked	6
the	6
first	6
for	6
what	6
offences	6
he	6
was	6
now	6
in	6
such	6
a	6
sorry	6
case.	6
He	6
made	6
answer	6
that	6
it	6
was	6
for	6
being	6
a	6
lover.	6
“For	6
that	6
only?”	6
replied	6
Don	6
Quixote;	6
“why,	6
if	6
for	6
being	6
lovers	6
they	6
send	6
people	6
to	6
the	6
galleys	6
I	6
might	6
have	6
been	6
rowing	6
in	6
them	6
long	6
ago.”	6
“The	6
love	6
is	6
not	6
the	6
sort	6
your	6
worship	6
is	6
thinking	6
of,”	6
said	6
the	6
galley	6
slave;	6
“mine	6
was	6
that	6
I	6
loved	6
a	6
washerwoman’s	6
basket	6
of	6
clean	6
linen	6
so	6
well,	6
and	6
held	6
it	6
so	6
close	6
in	6
my	6
embrace,	6
that	6
if	6
the	6
arm	6
of	6
the	6
law	6
had	6
not	6
forced	6
it	6
from	6
me,	6
I	6
should	6
never	6
have	6
let	6
it	6
go	6
of	6
my	6
own	6
will	6
to	6
this	6
moment;	6
I	6
was	6
caught	6
in	6
the	6
act,	6
there	6
was	6
no	6
occasion	6
for	6
torture,	6
the	6
case	6
was	6
settled,	6
they	6
treated	6
me	6
to	6
a	6
hundred	6
lashes	6
on	6
the	6
back,	6
and	6
three	6
years	6
of	6
gurapas	6
besides,	6
and	6
that	6
was	6
the	6
end	6
of	6
it.”	6
“What	6
are	6
gurapas?”	6
asked	6
Don	6
Quixote.	6
“Gurapas	6
are	6
galleys,”	6
answered	6
the	6
galley	6
slave,	6
who	6
was	6
a	6
young	6
man	6
of	6
about	6
four-and-twenty,	6
and	6
said	6
he	6
was	6
a	6
native	6
of	6
Piedrahita.	6
Don	6
Quixote	6
asked	6
the	6
same	6
question	6
of	6
the	6
second,	6
who	6
made	6
no	6
reply,	6
so	6
downcast	6
and	6
melancholy	6
was	6
he;	6
but	6
the	6
first	6
answered	6
for	6
him,	6
and	6
said,	6
“He,	6
sir,	6
goes	6
as	6
a	6
canary,	6
I	6
mean	6
as	6
a	6
musician	6
and	6
a	6
singer.”	6
“What!”	6
said	6
Don	6
Quixote,	6
“for	6
being	6
musicians	6
and	6
singers	6
are	6
people	6
sent	6
to	6
the	6
galleys	6
too?”	6
“Yes,	6
sir,”	6
answered	6
the	6
galley	6
slave,	6
“for	6
there	6
is	6
nothing	6
worse	6
than	6
singing	6
under	6
suffering.”	6
“On	6
the	6
contrary,	6
I	6
have	6
heard	6
say,”	6
said	6
Don	6
Quixote,	6
“that	6
he	6
who	6
sings	6
scares	6
away	6
his	6
woes.”	6
“Here	6
it	6
is	6
the	6
reverse,”	6
said	6
the	6
galley	6
slave;	6
“for	6
he	6
who	6
sings	6
once	6
weeps	6
all	6
his	6
life.”	6
“I	6
do	6
not	6
understand	6
it,”	6
said	6
Don	6
Quixote;	6
but	6
one	6
of	6
the	6
guards	6
said	6
to	6
him,	6
“Sir,	6
to	6
sing	6
under	6
suffering	6
means	6
with	6
the	6
_non	6
sancta_	6
fraternity	6
to	6
confess	6
under	6
torture;	6
they	6
put	6
this	6
sinner	6
to	6
the	6
torture	6
and	6
he	6
confessed	6
his	6
crime,	6
which	6
was	6
being	6
a	6
cuatrero,	6
that	6
is	6
a	6
cattle-stealer,	6
and	6
on	6
his	6
confession	6
they	6
sentenced	6
him	6
to	6
six	6
years	6
in	6
the	6
galleys,	6
besides	6
two	6
hundred	6
lashes	6
that	6
he	6
has	6
already	6
had	6
on	6
the	6
back;	6
and	6
he	6
is	6
always	6
dejected	6
and	6
downcast	6
because	6
the	6
other	6
thieves	6
that	6
were	6
left	6
behind	6
and	6
that	6
march	6
here	6
ill-treat,	6
and	6
snub,	6
and	6
jeer,	6
and	6
despise	6
him	6
for	6
confessing	6
and	6
not	6
having	6
spirit	6
enough	6
to	6
say	6
nay;	6
for,	6
say	6
they,	6
‘nay’	6
has	6
no	6
more	6
letters	6
in	6
it	6
than	6
‘yea,’	6
and	6
a	6
culprit	6
is	6
well	6
off	6
when	6
life	6
or	6
death	6
with	6
him	6
depends	6
on	6
his	6
own	6
tongue	6
and	6
not	6
on	6
that	6
of	6
witnesses	6
or	6
evidence;	6
and	6
to	6
my	6
thinking	6
they	6
are	6
not	6
very	6
far	6
out.”	6
“And	6
I	6
think	6
so	6
too,”	6
answered	6
Don	6
Quixote;	6
then	6
passing	6
on	6
to	6
the	6
third	6
he	6
asked	6
him	6
what	6
he	6
had	6
asked	6
the	6
others,	6
and	6
the	6
man	6
answered	6
very	6
readily	6
and	6
unconcernedly,	6
“I	6
am	6
going	6
for	6
five	6
years	6
to	6
their	6
ladyships	6
the	6
gurapas	6
for	6
the	6
want	6
of	6
ten	6
ducats.”	6
“I	6
will	6
give	6
twenty	6
with	6
pleasure	6
to	6
get	6
you	6
out	6
of	6
that	6
trouble,”	6
said	6
Don	6
Quixote.	6
“That,”	6
said	6
the	6
galley	6
slave,	6
“is	6
like	6
a	6
man	6
having	6
money	6
at	6
sea	6
when	6
he	6
is	6
dying	6
of	6
hunger	6
and	6
has	6
no	6
way	6
of	6
buying	6
what	6
he	6
wants;	6
I	6
say	6
so	6
because	6
if	6
at	6
the	6
right	6
time	6
I	6
had	7
those	7
twenty	7
ducats	7
that	7
your	7
worship	7
now	7
offers	7
me,	7
I	7
would	7
have	7
greased	7
the	7
notary’s	7
pen	7
and	7
freshened	7
up	7
the	7
attorney’s	7
wit	7
with	7
them,	7
so	7
that	7
to-day	7
I	7
should	7
be	7
in	7
the	7
middle	7
of	7
the	7
plaza	7
of	7
the	7
Zocodover	7
at	7
Toledo,	7
and	7
not	7
on	7
this	7
road	7
coupled	7
like	7
a	7
greyhound.	7
But	7
God	7
is	7
great;	7
patience—there,	7
that’s	7
enough	7
of	7
it.”	7
Don	7
Quixote	7
passed	7
on	7
to	7
the	7
fourth,	7
a	7
man	7
of	7
venerable	7
aspect	7
with	7
a	7
white	7
beard	7
falling	7
below	7
his	7
breast,	7
who	7
on	7
hearing	7
himself	7
asked	7
the	7
reason	7
of	7
his	7
being	7
there	7
began	7
to	7
weep	7
without	7
answering	7
a	7
word,	7
but	7
the	7
fifth	7
acted	7
as	7
his	7
tongue	7
and	7
said,	7
“This	7
worthy	7
man	7
is	7
going	7
to	7
the	7
galleys	7
for	7
four	7
years,	7
after	7
having	7
gone	7
the	7
rounds	7
in	7
ceremony	7
and	7
on	7
horseback.”	7
“That	7
means,”	7
said	7
Sancho	7
Panza,	7
“as	7
I	7
take	7
it,	7
to	7
have	7
been	7
exposed	7
to	7
shame	7
in	7
public.”	7
“Just	7
so,”	7
replied	7
the	7
galley	7
slave,	7
“and	7
the	7
offence	7
for	7
which	7
they	7
gave	7
him	7
that	7
punishment	7
was	7
having	7
been	7
an	7
ear-broker,	7
nay	7
body-broker;	7
I	7
mean,	7
in	7
short,	7
that	7
this	7
gentleman	7
goes	7
as	7
a	7
pimp,	7
and	7
for	7
having	7
besides	7
a	7
certain	7
touch	7
of	7
the	7
sorcerer	7
about	7
him.”	7
“If	7
that	7
touch	7
had	7
not	7
been	7
thrown	7
in,”	7
said	7
Don	7
Quixote,	7
“he	7
would	7
not	7
deserve,	7
for	7
mere	7
pimping,	7
to	7
row	7
in	7
the	7
galleys,	7
but	7
rather	7
to	7
command	7
and	7
be	7
admiral	7
of	7
them;	7
for	7
the	7
office	7
of	7
pimp	7
is	7
no	7
ordinary	7
one,	7
being	7
the	7
office	7
of	7
persons	7
of	7
discretion,	7
one	7
very	7
necessary	7
in	7
a	7
well-ordered	7
state,	7
and	7
only	7
to	7
be	7
exercised	7
by	7
persons	7
of	7
good	7
birth;	7
nay,	7
there	7
ought	7
to	7
be	7
an	7
inspector	7
and	7
overseer	7
of	7
them,	7
as	7
in	7
other	7
offices,	7
and	7
recognised	7
number,	7
as	7
with	7
the	7
brokers	7
on	7
change;	7
in	7
this	7
way	7
many	7
of	7
the	7
evils	7
would	7
be	7
avoided	7
which	7
are	7
caused	7
by	7
this	7
office	7
and	7
calling	7
being	7
in	7
the	7
hands	7
of	7
stupid	7
and	7
ignorant	7
people,	7
such	7
as	7
women	7
more	7
or	7
less	7
silly,	7
and	7
pages	7
and	7
jesters	7
of	7
little	7
standing	7
and	7
experience,	7
who	7
on	7
the	7
most	7
urgent	7
occasions,	7
and	7
when	7
ingenuity	7
of	7
contrivance	7
is	7
needed,	7
let	7
the	7
crumbs	7
freeze	7
on	7
the	7
way	7
to	7
their	7
mouths,	7
and	7
know	7
not	7
which	7
is	7
their	7
right	7
hand.	7
I	7
should	7
like	7
to	7
go	7
farther,	7
and	7
give	7
reasons	7
to	7
show	7
that	7
it	7
is	7
advisable	7
to	7
choose	7
those	7
who	7
are	7
to	7
hold	7
so	7
necessary	7
an	7
office	7
in	7
the	7
state,	7
but	7
this	7
is	7
not	7
the	7
fit	7
place	7
for	7
it;	7
some	7
day	7
I	7
will	7
expound	7
the	7
matter	7
to	7
someone	7
able	7
to	7
see	7
to	7
and	7
rectify	7
it;	7
all	7
I	7
say	7
now	7
is,	7
that	7
the	7
additional	7
fact	7
of	7
his	7
being	7
a	7
sorcerer	7
has	7
removed	7
the	7
sorrow	7
it	7
gave	7
me	7
to	7
see	7
these	7
white	7
hairs	7
and	7
this	7
venerable	7
countenance	7
in	7
so	7
painful	7
a	7
position	7
on	7
account	7
of	7
his	7
being	7
a	7
pimp;	7
though	7
I	7
know	7
well	7
there	7
are	7
no	7
sorceries	7
in	7
the	7
world	7
that	7
can	7
move	7
or	7
compel	7
the	7
will	7
as	7
some	7
simple	7
folk	7
fancy,	7
for	7
our	7
will	7
is	7
free,	7
nor	7
is	7
there	7
herb	7
or	7
charm	7
that	7
can	7
force	7
it.	7
All	7
that	7
certain	7
silly	7
women	7
and	7
quacks	7
do	7
is	7
to	7
turn	7
men	7
mad	7
with	7
potions	7
and	7
poisons,	7
pretending	7
that	7
they	7
have	7
power	7
to	7
cause	7
love,	7
for,	7
as	7
I	7
say,	7
it	7
is	7
an	7
impossibility	7
to	7
compel	7
the	7
will.”	7
“It	7
is	7
true,”	7
said	7
the	7
good	7
old	7
man,	7
“and	7
indeed,	7
sir,	7
as	7
far	7
as	7
the	7
charge	7
of	7
sorcery	7
goes	7
I	7
was	7
not	7
guilty;	7
as	7
to	7
that	7
of	7
being	7
a	7
pimp	7
I	7
cannot	7
deny	7
it;	7
but	7
I	7
never	7
thought	7
I	7
was	7
doing	7
any	7
harm	7
by	7
it,	7
for	7
my	7
only	7
object	7
was	7
that	7
all	7
the	7
world	7
should	7
enjoy	7
itself	7
and	7
live	7
in	7
peace	7
and	7
quiet,	7
without	7
quarrels	7
or	7
troubles;	7
but	7
my	7
good	7
intentions	7
were	7
unavailing	7
to	7
save	7
me	7
from	7
going	7
where	7
I	7
never	7
expect	7
to	7
come	7
back	7
from,	7
with	7
this	7
weight	7
of	7
years	7
upon	7
me	7
and	7
a	7
urinary	7
ailment	7
that	7
never	7
gives	7
me	7
a	7
moment’s	7
ease;”	7
and	7
again	7
he	7
fell	7
to	7
weeping	7
as	7
before,	7
and	7
such	7
compassion	7
did	7
Sancho	7
feel	7
for	7
him	7
that	7
he	7
took	7
out	7
a	7
real	7
of	7
four	7
from	7
his	7
bosom	7
and	7
gave	7
it	7
to	7
him	7
in	7
alms.	7
Don	7
Quixote	7
went	7
on	7
and	7
asked	7
another	7
what	7
his	7
crime	7
was,	7
and	7
the	7
man	7
answered	7
with	7
no	7
less	7
but	7
rather	7
much	7
more	7
sprightliness	7
than	7
the	7
last	7
one.	7
“I	7
am	7
here	7
because	7
I	7
carried	7
the	7
joke	7
too	7
far	7
with	7
a	7
couple	7
of	7
cousins	7
of	7
mine,	7
and	7
with	7
a	7
couple	7
of	7
other	7
cousins	7
who	7
were	7
none	7
of	7
mine;	7
in	7
short,	7
I	7
carried	7
the	7
joke	7
so	7
far	7
with	7
them	7
all	7
that	7
it	7
ended	7
in	7
such	7
a	7
complicated	7
increase	7
of	7
kindred	7
that	7
no	7
accountant	7
could	7
make	7
it	7
clear:	7
it	7
was	7
all	7
proved	7
against	7
me,	7
I	7
got	7
no	7
favour,	7
I	7
had	7
no	7
money,	7
I	7
was	7
near	7
having	7
my	7
neck	7
stretched,	7
they	7
sentenced	7
me	7
to	7
the	7
galleys	7
for	7
six	7
years,	7
I	7
accepted	7
my	7
fate,	7
it	7
is	7
the	7
punishment	7
of	7
my	7
fault;	7
I	7
am	7
a	7
young	7
man;	7
let	7
life	7
only	7
last,	7
and	7
with	7
that	7
all	7
will	7
come	7
right.	7
If	7
you,	7
sir,	7
have	7
anything	7
wherewith	7
to	7
help	7
the	7
poor,	7
God	7
will	7
repay	7
it	7
to	7
you	7
in	7
heaven,	7
and	7
we	7
on	7
earth	7
will	7
take	7
care	7
in	7
our	7
petitions	7
to	7
him	7
to	7
pray	7
for	7
the	7
life	7
and	7
health	7
of	7
your	7
worship,	7
that	7
they	7
may	7
be	7
as	7
long	7
and	7
as	7
good	7
as	7
your	7
amiable	7
appearance	7
deserves.”	7
This	7
one	7
was	7
in	7
the	7
dress	7
of	7
a	7
student,	7
and	7
one	7
of	7
the	7
guards	7
said	7
he	7
was	7
a	7
great	7
talker	7
and	7
a	7
very	7
elegant	7
Latin	7
scholar.	7
Behind	7
all	7
these	7
there	7
came	7
a	7
man	7
of	7
thirty,	7
a	7
very	7
personable	7
fellow,	7
except	7
that	7
when	7
he	7
looked,	7
his	7
eyes	7
turned	7
in	7
a	7
little	7
one	7
towards	7
the	7
other.	7
He	7
was	7
bound	7
differently	7
from	7
the	7
rest,	7
for	7
he	7
had	7
to	7
his	7
leg	7
a	7
chain	7
so	7
long	7
that	7
it	7
was	7
wound	7
all	7
round	7
his	7
body,	7
and	7
two	7
rings	7
on	7
his	7
neck,	7
one	7
attached	7
to	7
the	7
chain,	7
the	7
other	7
to	7
what	7
they	7
call	7
a	7
“keep-friend”	7
or	7
“friend’s	7
foot,”	7
from	7
which	7
hung	7
two	7
irons	7
reaching	7
to	7
his	7
waist	7
with	7
two	7
manacles	7
fixed	7
to	7
them	7
in	7
which	7
his	7
hands	7
were	7
secured	7
by	7
a	7
big	7
padlock,	7
so	7
that	7
he	7
could	7
neither	7
raise	7
his	7
hands	7
to	7
his	7
mouth	7
nor	7
lower	7
his	7
head	7
to	7
his	7
hands.	7
Don	7
Quixote	7
asked	7
why	7
this	7
man	7
carried	7
so	7
many	7
more	7
chains	7
than	7
the	7
others.	7
The	7
guard	7
replied	7
that	7
it	7
was	7
because	7
he	7
alone	7
had	7
committed	7
more	7
crimes	7
than	7
all	7
the	7
rest	7
put	7
together,	7
and	7
was	7
so	7
daring	7
and	7
such	7
a	7
villain,	7
that	7
though	7
they	7
marched	7
him	7
in	7
that	7
fashion	7
they	7
did	7
not	7
feel	7
sure	7
of	7
him,	7
but	7
were	7
in	7
dread	7
of	7
his	7
making	7
his	7
escape.	7
“What	7
crimes	7
can	7
he	7
have	7
committed,”	7
said	7
Don	7
Quixote,	7
“if	7
they	7
have	7
not	7
deserved	7
a	7
heavier	7
punishment	7
than	7
being	7
sent	7
to	7
the	7
galleys?”	7
“He	7
goes	7
for	7
ten	7
years,”	7
replied	7
the	7
guard,	7
“which	7
is	7
the	7
same	7
thing	7
as	7
civil	7
death,	7
and	7
all	7
that	7
need	7
be	7
said	7
is	7
that	7
this	7
good	7
fellow	7
is	7
the	7
famous	7
Gines	7
de	7
Pasamonte,	7
otherwise	7
called	7
Ginesillo	7
de	7
Parapilla.”	7
“Gently,	7
señor	7
commissary,”	7
said	7
the	7
galley	7
slave	7
at	7
this,	7
“let	7
us	7
have	7
no	7
fixing	7
of	7
names	7
or	7
surnames;	7
my	7
name	7
is	7
Gines,	7
not	7
Ginesillo,	7
and	7
my	7
family	7
name	7
is	7
Pasamonte,	7
not	7
Parapilla	7
as	7
you	7
say;	7
let	7
each	7
one	7
mind	7
his	7
own	7
business,	7
and	7
he	7
will	7
be	7
doing	7
enough.”	7
“Speak	7
with	7
less	7
impertinence,	7
master	7
thief	7
of	7
extra	7
measure,”	7
replied	7
the	7
commissary,	7
“if	7
you	7
don’t	7
want	7
me	7
to	7
make	7
you	7
hold	7
your	7
tongue	7
in	7
spite	7
of	7
your	7
teeth.”	7
“It	7
is	7
easy	7
to	7
see,”	7
returned	7
the	7
galley	7
slave,	7
“that	7
man	7
goes	7
as	7
God	7
pleases,	7
but	7
someone	7
shall	7
know	7
some	7
day	7
whether	7
I	7
am	7
called	7
Ginesillo	7
de	7
Parapilla	7
or	7
not.”	7
“Don’t	7
they	7
call	7
you	7
so,	7
you	7
liar?”	7
said	7
the	7
guard.	7
“They	7
do,”	7
returned	7
Gines,	7
“but	7
I	7
will	7
make	7
them	7
give	7
over	7
calling	7
me	7
so,	7
or	7
I	7
will	7
be	7
shaved,	7
where,	7
I	7
only	7
say	7
behind	7
my	7
teeth.	7
If	7
you,	7
sir,	7
have	7
anything	7
to	7
give	7
us,	7
give	7
it	7
to	7
us	7
at	7
once,	7
and	7
God	7
speed	7
you,	7
for	7
you	7
are	7
becoming	7
tiresome	7
with	7
all	7
this	7
inquisitiveness	7
about	7
the	7
lives	7
of	7
others;	7
if	7
you	7
want	7
to	7
know	7
about	7
mine,	7
let	7
me	7
tell	7
you	7
I	7
am	7
Gines	7
de	7
Pasamonte,	7
whose	7
life	7
is	7
written	7
by	7
these	7
fingers.”	7
“He	7
says	7
true,”	7
said	7
the	7
commissary,	7
“for	7
he	7
has	7
himself	7
written	7
his	7
story	7
as	7
grand	7
as	7
you	7
please,	7
and	7
has	7
left	7
the	7
book	7
in	7
the	7
prison	7
in	7
pawn	7
for	7
two	7
hundred	7
reals.”	7
“And	7
I	7
mean	7
to	7
take	7
it	7
out	7
of	7
pawn,”	7
said	7
Gines,	7
“though	7
it	7
were	7
in	7
for	7
two	7
hundred	7
ducats.”	7
“Is	7
it	7
so	7
good?”	7
said	7
Don	7
Quixote.	7
“So	7
good	7
is	7
it,”	7
replied	7
Gines,	7
“that	7
a	7
fig	7
for	7
‘Lazarillo	7
de	7
Tormes,’	7
and	7
all	7
of	7
that	7
kind	7
that	7
have	7
been	7
written,	7
or	7
shall	7
be	7
written	7
compared	7
with	7
it:	7
all	7
I	7
will	7
say	7
about	7
it	7
is	7
that	7
it	7
deals	7
with	7
facts,	7
and	7
facts	7
so	7
neat	7
and	7
diverting	7
that	7
no	7
lies	7
could	7
match	7
them.”	7
“And	7
how	7
is	7
the	7
book	7
entitled?”	7
asked	7
Don	7
Quixote.	7
“The	7
‘Life	7
of	7
Gines	7
de	7
Pasamonte,’”	7
replied	7
the	7
subject	7
of	7
it.	7
“And	7
is	7
it	7
finished?”	7
asked	7
Don	7
Quixote.	7
“How	7
can	7
it	7
be	7
finished,”	7
said	7
the	7
other,	7
“when	7
my	7
life	7
is	7
not	7
yet	7
finished?	7
All	7
that	7
is	7
written	7
is	7
from	7
my	7
birth	7
down	7
to	7
the	7
point	7
when	7
they	7
sent	7
me	7
to	7
the	7
galleys	7
this	7
last	7
time.”	7
“Then	7
you	7
have	7
been	7
there	7
before?”	7
said	7
Don	7
Quixote.	7
“In	7
the	7
service	7
of	7
God	7
and	7
the	7
king	7
I	7
have	7
been	7
there	7
for	7
four	7
years	7
before	7
now,	7
and	7
I	7
know	7
by	7
this	7
time	7
what	7
the	7
biscuit	7
and	7
courbash	7
are	7
like,”	7
replied	7
Gines;	7
“and	7
it	7
is	7
no	7
great	7
grievance	7
to	7
me	7
to	7
go	7
back	7
to	7
them,	7
for	7
there	7
I	7
shall	7
have	7
time	7
to	7
finish	7
my	7
book;	7
I	7
have	7
still	7
many	7
things	7
left	7
to	7
say,	7
and	7
in	7
the	7
galleys	7
of	7
Spain	7
there	7
is	7
more	7
than	7
enough	7
leisure;	7
though	7
I	7
do	7
not	7
want	7
much	7
for	7
what	7
I	7
have	7
to	7
write,	7
for	7
I	7
have	7
it	7
by	7
heart.”	7
“You	7
seem	7
a	7
clever	7
fellow,”	7
said	7
Don	7
Quixote.	7
“And	7
an	7
unfortunate	7
one,”	7
replied	7
Gines,	7
“for	7
misfortune	7
always	7
persecutes	7
good	7
wit.”	7
“It	7
persecutes	7
rogues,”	7
said	7
the	7
commissary.	7
“I	7
told	7
you	7
already	7
to	7
go	7
gently,	7
master	7
commissary,”	7
said	7
Pasamonte;	7
“their	7
lordships	7
yonder	7
never	7
gave	7
you	7
that	7
staff	7
to	7
ill-treat	7
us	7
wretches	7
here,	7
but	7
to	7
conduct	7
and	7
take	7
us	7
where	7
his	7
majesty	7
orders	7
you;	7
if	7
not,	7
by	7
the	7
life	7
of-never	7
mind—;	7
it	7
may	7
be	7
that	7
some	7
day	7
the	7
stains	7
made	7
in	7
the	7
inn	7
will	7
come	7
out	7
in	7
the	7
scouring;	7
let	7
everyone	7
hold	7
his	7
tongue	7
and	7
behave	7
well	7
and	7
speak	7
better;	7
and	7
now	7
let	7
us	7
march	7
on,	7
for	7
we	7
have	7
had	7
quite	7
enough	7
of	7
this	7
entertainment.”	7
The	7
commissary	7
lifted	7
his	7
staff	7
to	7
strike	7
Pasamonte	7
in	7
return	7
for	7
his	7
threats,	7
but	7
Don	7
Quixote	7
came	7
between	7
them,	7
and	7
begged	7
him	7
not	7
to	7
ill-use	7
him,	7
as	7
it	7
was	7
not	7
too	7
much	7
to	7
allow	7
one	7
who	7
had	7
his	7
hands	7
tied	7
to	7
have	7
his	7
tongue	7
a	7
trifle	7
free;	7
and	7
turning	7
to	7
the	7
whole	7
chain	7
of	7
them	7
he	7
said:	7
“From	7
all	7
you	7
have	7
told	7
me,	7
dear	7
brethren,	7
make	7
out	7
clearly	7
that	7
though	7
they	7
have	7
punished	7
you	7
for	7
your	7
faults,	7
the	7
punishments	7
you	7
are	7
about	7
to	7
endure	7
do	7
not	7
give	7
you	7
much	7
pleasure,	7
and	7
that	7
you	7
go	7
to	7
them	7
very	7
much	7
against	7
the	7
grain	7
and	7
against	7
your	7
will,	7
and	7
that	7
perhaps	7
this	7
one’s	7
want	7
of	7
courage	7
under	7
torture,	7
that	7
one’s	7
want	7
of	7
money,	7
the	7
other’s	7
want	7
of	7
advocacy,	7
and	7
lastly	7
the	7
perverted	7
judgment	7
of	7
the	7
judge	7
may	7
have	7
been	7
the	7
cause	7
of	7
your	7
ruin	7
and	7
of	7
your	7
failure	7
to	7
obtain	7
the	7
justice	7
you	7
had	7
on	7
your	7
side.	7
All	7
which	7
presents	7
itself	7
now	7
to	7
my	7
mind,	7
urging,	7
persuading,	7
and	7
even	7
compelling	7
me	7
to	7
demonstrate	7
in	7
your	7
case	7
the	7
purpose	7
for	7
which	7
Heaven	7
sent	7
me	7
into	7
the	7
world	7
and	7
caused	7
me	7
to	7
make	7
profession	7
of	7
the	7
order	7
of	7
chivalry	7
to	7
which	7
I	7
belong,	7
and	7
the	7
vow	7
I	7
took	7
therein	7
to	7
give	7
aid	7
to	7
those	7
in	7
need	7
and	7
under	7
the	7
oppression	7
of	7
the	7
strong.	7
But	7
as	7
I	7
know	7
that	7
it	7
is	7
a	7
mark	7
of	7
prudence	7
not	7
to	7
do	7
by	7
foul	7
means	7
what	7
may	7
be	7
done	7
by	7
fair,	7
I	7
will	7
ask	7
these	7
gentlemen,	7
the	7
guards	7
and	7
commissary,	7
to	7
be	7
so	7
good	7
as	7
to	7
release	7
you	7
and	7
let	7
you	7
go	7
in	7
peace,	7
as	7
there	7
will	7
be	7
no	7
lack	7
of	7
others	7
to	7
serve	7
the	7
king	7
under	7
more	7
favourable	7
circumstances;	7
for	7
it	7
seems	7
to	7
me	7
a	7
hard	7
case	7
to	7
make	7
slaves	7
of	7
those	7
whom	7
God	7
and	7
nature	7
have	7
made	7
free.	7
Moreover,	7
sirs	7
of	7
the	7
guard,”	7
added	7
Don	7
Quixote,	7
“these	7
poor	7
fellows	7
have	7
done	7
nothing	7
to	7
you;	7
let	7
each	7
answer	7
for	7
his	7
own	7
sins	7
yonder;	7
there	7
is	7
a	7
God	7
in	7
Heaven	7
who	7
will	7
not	7
forget	7
to	7
punish	7
the	7
wicked	7
or	7
reward	7
the	7
good;	7
and	7
it	7
is	7
not	7
fitting	7
that	7
honest	7
men	7
should	7
be	7
the	7
instruments	7
of	7
punishment	7
to	7
others,	7
they	7
being	7
therein	7
no	7
way	7
concerned.	7
This	7
request	7
I	7
make	7
thus	7
gently	7
and	7
quietly,	7
that,	7
if	7
you	7
comply	7
with	7
it,	7
I	7
may	7
have	7
reason	7
for	7
thanking	7
you;	7
and,	7
if	7
you	7
will	7
not	7
voluntarily,	7
this	7
lance	7
and	7
sword	7
together	7
with	7
the	7
might	7
of	7
my	7
arm	7
shall	7
compel	7
you	7
to	7
comply	7
with	7
it	7
by	7
force.”	7
“Nice	7
nonsense!”	7
said	7
the	7
commissary;	7
“a	7
fine	7
piece	7
of	7
pleasantry	7
he	7
has	7
come	7
out	7
with	7
at	7
last!	7
He	7
wants	7
us	7
to	7
let	7
the	7
king’s	7
prisoners	7
go,	7
as	7
if	7
we	7
had	7
any	7
authority	7
to	7
release	7
them,	7
or	7
he	7
to	7
order	7
us	7
to	7
do	7
so!	7
Go	7
your	7
way,	7
sir,	7
and	7
good	7
luck	7
to	7
you;	7
put	7
that	7
basin	7
straight	7
that	7
you’ve	7
got	7
on	7
your	7
head,	7
and	7
don’t	7
go	7
looking	7
for	7
three	7
feet	7
on	7
a	7
cat.”	7
“’Tis	7
you	7
that	7
are	7
the	7
cat,	7
rat,	7
and	7
rascal,”	7
replied	7
Don	7
Quixote,	7
and	7
acting	7
on	7
the	7
word	7
he	7
fell	7
upon	7
him	7
so	7
suddenly	7
that	7
without	7
giving	7
him	7
time	7
to	7
defend	7
himself	7
he	7
brought	7
him	7
to	7
the	7
ground	7
sorely	7
wounded	7
with	7
a	7
lance-thrust;	7
and	7
lucky	7
it	7
was	7
for	7
him	7
that	7
it	7
was	7
the	7
one	7
that	7
had	7
the	7
musket.	7
The	7
other	7
guards	7
stood	7
thunderstruck	7
and	7
amazed	7
at	7
this	7
unexpected	7
event,	7
but	7
recovering	7
presence	7
of	7
mind,	7
those	7
on	7
horseback	7
seized	7
their	7
swords,	7
and	7
those	7
on	7
foot	7
their	7
javelins,	7
and	7
attacked	7
Don	7
Quixote,	7
who	7
was	7
waiting	7
for	7
them	7
with	7
great	7
calmness;	7
and	7
no	7
doubt	7
it	7
would	7
have	7
gone	7
badly	7
with	7
him	7
if	7
the	7
galley	7
slaves,	7
seeing	7
the	7
chance	7
before	7
them	7
of	7
liberating	7
themselves,	7
had	7
not	7
effected	7
it	7
by	7
contriving	7
to	7
break	7
the	7
chain	7
on	7
which	7
they	7
were	7
strung.	7
Such	7
was	7
the	7
confusion,	7
that	7
the	7
guards,	7
now	7
rushing	7
at	7
the	7
galley	7
slaves	7
who	7
were	7
breaking	7
loose,	7
now	7
to	7
attack	7
Don	7
Quixote	7
who	7
was	7
waiting	7
for	7
them,	7
did	7
nothing	7
at	7
all	7
that	7
was	7
of	7
any	7
use.	7
Sancho,	7
on	7
his	7
part,	7
gave	7
a	7
helping	7
hand	7
to	7
release	7
Gines	7
de	7
Pasamonte,	7
who	7
was	7
the	7
first	7
to	7
leap	7
forth	7
upon	7
the	7
plain	7
free	7
and	7
unfettered,	7
and	7
who,	7
attacking	7
the	7
prostrate	7
commissary,	7
took	7
from	7
him	7
his	7
sword	7
and	7
the	7
musket,	7
with	7
which,	7
aiming	7
at	7
one	7
and	7
levelling	7
at	7
another,	7
he,	7
without	7
ever	7
discharging	7
it,	7
drove	7
every	7
one	7
of	7
the	7
guards	7
off	7
the	7
field,	7
for	7
they	7
took	7
to	7
flight,	7
as	7
well	7
to	7
escape	7
Pasamonte’s	7
musket,	7
as	7
the	7
showers	7
of	7
stones	7
the	7
now	7
released	7
galley	7
slaves	7
were	7
raining	7
upon	7
them.	7
Sancho	7
was	7
greatly	7
grieved	7
at	7
the	7
affair,	7
because	7
he	7
anticipated	7
that	7
those	7
who	7
had	7
fled	7
would	7
report	7
the	7
matter	7
to	7
the	7
Holy	7
Brotherhood,	7
who	7
at	7
the	7
summons	7
of	7
the	7
alarm-bell	7
would	7
at	7
once	7
sally	7
forth	7
in	7
quest	7
of	7
the	7
offenders;	7
and	7
he	7
said	7
so	7
to	7
his	7
master,	7
and	7
entreated	7
him	7
to	7
leave	7
the	7
place	7
at	7
once,	7
and	7
go	7
into	7
hiding	7
in	7
the	7
sierra	7
that	7
was	7
close	7
by.	7
“That	7
is	7
all	7
very	7
well,”	7
said	7
Don	7
Quixote,	7
“but	7
I	7
know	7
what	7
must	7
be	7
done	7
now;”	7
and	7
calling	7
together	7
all	7
the	7
galley	7
slaves,	7
who	7
were	7
now	7
running	7
riot,	7
and	7
had	7
stripped	7
the	7
commissary	7
to	7
the	7
skin,	7
he	7
collected	7
them	7
round	7
him	7
to	7
hear	7
what	7
he	7
had	7
to	7
say,	7
and	7
addressed	7
them	7
as	7
follows:	7
“To	7
be	7
grateful	7
for	7
benefits	7
received	7
is	7
the	7
part	7
of	7
persons	7
of	7
good	7
birth,	7
and	7
one	7
of	7
the	7
sins	7
most	7
offensive	7
to	7
God	7
is	7
ingratitude;	7
I	7
say	7
so	7
because,	7
sirs,	7
ye	7
have	7
already	7
seen	7
by	7
manifest	7
proof	7
the	7
benefit	7
ye	7
have	7
received	7
of	7
me;	7
in	7
return	7
for	7
which	7
I	7
desire,	7
and	7
it	7
is	7
my	7
good	7
pleasure	7
that,	7
laden	7
with	7
that	7
chain	7
which	7
I	7
have	7
taken	7
off	7
your	7
necks,	7
ye	7
at	7
once	7
set	7
out	7
and	7
proceed	7
to	7
the	7
city	7
of	7
El	7
Toboso,	7
and	7
there	7
present	7
yourselves	7
before	7
the	7
lady	7
Dulcinea	7
del	7
Toboso,	7
and	7
say	7
to	7
her	7
that	7
her	7
knight,	7
he	7
of	7
the	7
Rueful	7
Countenance,	7
sends	7
to	7
commend	7
himself	7
to	7
her;	7
and	7
that	7
ye	7
recount	7
to	7
her	7
in	7
full	7
detail	7
all	7
the	7
particulars	7
of	7
this	7
notable	7
adventure,	7
up	7
to	7
the	7
recovery	7
of	7
your	7
longed-for	7
liberty;	7
and	7
this	7
done	7
ye	7
may	7
go	7
where	7
ye	7
will,	7
and	7
good	7
fortune	7
attend	7
you.”	7
Gines	7
de	7
Pasamonte	7
made	7
answer	7
for	7
all,	7
saying,	7
“That	7
which	7
you,	7
sir,	7
our	7
deliverer,	7
demand	7
of	7
us,	7
is	7
of	7
all	7
impossibilities	7
the	7
most	7
impossible	7
to	7
comply	7
with,	7
because	7
we	7
cannot	7
go	7
together	7
along	7
the	7
roads,	7
but	7
only	7
singly	7
and	7
separate,	7
and	7
each	7
one	7
his	7
own	7
way,	7
endeavouring	7
to	7
hide	7
ourselves	7
in	7
the	7
bowels	7
of	7
the	7
earth	7
to	7
escape	7
the	7
Holy	7
Brotherhood,	7
which,	7
no	7
doubt,	7
will	7
come	7
out	7
in	7
search	7
of	7
us.	7
What	7
your	7
worship	7
may	7
do,	7
and	7
fairly	7
do,	7
is	7
to	7
change	7
this	7
service	7
and	7
tribute	7
as	7
regards	7
the	7
lady	7
Dulcinea	7
del	7
Toboso	7
for	7
a	7
certain	7
quantity	7
of	7
ave-marias	7
and	7
credos	7
which	7
we	7
will	7
say	7
for	7
your	7
worship’s	7
intention,	7
and	7
this	7
is	7
a	7
condition	7
that	7
can	7
be	7
complied	7
with	7
by	7
night	7
as	7
by	7
day,	7
running	7
or	7
resting,	7
in	7
peace	7
or	7
in	7
war;	7
but	7
to	7
imagine	7
that	7
we	7
are	7
going	7
now	7
to	7
return	7
to	7
the	7
flesh-pots	7
of	7
Egypt,	7
I	7
mean	7
to	7
take	7
up	7
our	7
chain	7
and	7
set	7
out	7
for	7
El	7
Toboso,	7
is	7
to	7
imagine	7
that	7
it	7
is	7
now	7
night,	7
though	7
it	7
is	7
not	7
yet	7
ten	7
in	7
the	7
morning,	7
and	7
to	7
ask	7
this	7
of	7
us	7
is	7
like	7
asking	7
pears	7
of	7
the	7
elm	7
tree.”	7
“Then	7
by	7
all	7
that’s	7
good,”	7
said	7
Don	7
Quixote	7
(now	7
stirred	7
to	7
wrath),	7
“Don	7
son	7
of	7
a	7
bitch,	7
Don	7
Ginesillo	7
de	7
Paropillo,	7
or	7
whatever	7
your	7
name	7
is,	7
you	7
will	7
have	7
to	7
go	7
yourself	7
alone,	7
with	7
your	7
tail	7
between	7
your	7
legs	7
and	7
the	7
whole	7
chain	7
on	7
your	7
back.”	7
Pasamonte,	7
who	7
was	7
anything	7
but	7
meek	7
(being	7
by	7
this	7
time	7
thoroughly	7
convinced	7
that	7
Don	7
Quixote	7
was	7
not	7
quite	7
right	7
in	7
his	7
head	7
as	7
he	7
had	7
committed	7
such	7
a	7
vagary	7
as	7
to	7
set	7
them	7
free),	7
finding	7
himself	7
abused	7
in	7
this	7
fashion,	7
gave	7
the	7
wink	7
to	7
his	7
companions,	7
and	7
falling	7
back	7
they	7
began	7
to	7
shower	7
stones	7
on	7
Don	7
Quixote	7
at	7
such	7
a	7
rate	7
that	7
he	7
was	7
quite	7
unable	7
to	7
protect	7
himself	7
with	7
his	7
buckler,	7
and	7
poor	7
Rocinante	7
no	7
more	7
heeded	7
the	7
spur	7
than	7
if	7
he	7
had	7
been	7
made	7
of	7
brass.	7
Sancho	7
planted	7
himself	7
behind	7
his	7
ass,	7
and	7
with	7
him	7
sheltered	7
himself	7
from	7
the	7
hailstorm	7
that	7
poured	7
on	7
both	7
of	7
them.	7
Don	7
Quixote	7
was	7
unable	7
to	7
shield	7
himself	7
so	7
well	7
but	7
that	7
more	7
pebbles	7
than	7
I	7
could	7
count	7
struck	7
him	7
full	7
on	7
the	7
body	7
with	7
such	7
force	7
that	7
they	7
brought	7
him	7
to	7
the	7
ground;	7
and	7
the	7
instant	7
he	7
fell	7
the	7
student	7
pounced	7
upon	7
him,	7
snatched	7
the	7
basin	7
from	7
his	7
head,	7
and	7
with	7
it	7
struck	7
three	7
or	7
four	7
blows	7
on	7
his	7
shoulders,	7
and	7
as	7
many	7
more	7
on	7
the	7
ground,	7
knocking	7
it	7
almost	7
to	7
pieces.	7
They	7
then	7
stripped	7
him	7
of	7
a	7
jacket	7
that	7
he	7
wore	7
over	7
his	7
armour,	7
and	7
they	7
would	7
have	7
stripped	7
off	7
his	7
stockings	7
if	7
his	7
greaves	7
had	7
not	7
prevented	7
them.	7
From	7
Sancho	7
they	7
took	7
his	7
coat,	7
leaving	7
him	7
in	7
his	7
shirt-sleeves;	7
and	7
dividing	7
among	7
themselves	7
the	7
remaining	7
spoils	7
of	7
the	7
battle,	7
they	7
went	7
each	7
one	7
his	7
own	7
way,	7
more	7
solicitous	7
about	7
keeping	7
clear	7
of	7
the	7
Holy	7
Brotherhood	7
they	7
dreaded,	7
than	7
about	7
burdening	7
themselves	7
with	7
the	7
chain,	7
or	7
going	7
to	7
present	7
themselves	7
before	7
the	7
lady	7
Dulcinea	7
del	7
Toboso.	7
The	7
ass	7
and	7
Rocinante,	7
Sancho	7
and	7
Don	7
Quixote,	7
were	7
all	7
that	7
were	7
left	7
upon	7
the	7
spot;	7
the	7
ass	7
with	7
drooping	7
head,	7
serious,	7
shaking	7
his	7
ears	7
from	7
time	7
to	7
time	7
as	7
if	7
he	7
thought	7
the	7
storm	7
of	7
stones	7
that	7
assailed	7
them	7
was	7
not	7
yet	7
over;	7
Rocinante	7
stretched	7
beside	7
his	7
master,	7
for	7
he	7
too	7
had	7
been	7
brought	7
to	7
the	7
ground	7
by	7
a	7
stone;	7
Sancho	7
stripped,	7
and	7
trembling	7
with	7
fear	7
of	7
the	7
Holy	7
Brotherhood;	7
and	7
Don	7
Quixote	7
fuming	7
to	7
find	7
himself	7
so	7
served	7
by	7
the	7
very	7
persons	7
for	7
whom	7
he	7
had	7
done	7
so	7
much.	7

Seeing	7
himself	7
served	7
in	7
this	7
way,	7
Don	7
Quixote	7
said	7
to	7
his	7
squire,	7
“I	7
have	7
always	7
heard	7
it	7
said,	7
Sancho,	7
that	7
to	7
do	7
good	7
to	7
boors	7
is	7
to	7
throw	7
water	7
into	7
the	7
sea.	7
If	7
I	7
had	7
believed	7
thy	7
words,	7
I	7
should	7
have	7
avoided	7
this	7
trouble;	7
but	7
it	7
is	7
done	7
now,	7
it	7
is	7
only	7
to	7
have	7
patience	7
and	7
take	7
warning	7
for	7
the	7
future.”	7

“Your	7
worship	7
will	7
take	7
warning	7
as	7
much	7
as	7
I	7
am	7
a	7
Turk,”	7
returned	7
Sancho;	7
“but,	7
as	7
you	7
say	7
this	7
mischief	7
might	7
have	7
been	7
avoided	7
if	7
you	7
had	7
believed	7
me,	7
believe	7
me	7
now,	7
and	7
a	7
still	7
greater	7
one	7
will	7
be	7
avoided;	7
for	7
I	7
tell	7
you	7
chivalry	7
is	7
of	7
no	7
account	7
with	7
the	7
Holy	7
Brotherhood,	7
and	7
they	7
don’t	7
care	7
two	7
maravedis	7
for	7
all	7
the	7
knights-errant	7
in	7
the	7
world;	7
and	7
I	7
can	7
tell	7
you	7
I	7
fancy	7
I	7
hear	7
their	7
arrows	7
whistling	7
past	7
my	7
ears	7
this	7
minute.”	7
“Thou	7
art	7
a	7
coward	7
by	7
nature,	7
Sancho,”	7
said	7
Don	7
Quixote,	7
“but	7
lest	7
thou	7
shouldst	7
say	7
I	7
am	7
obstinate,	7
and	7
that	7
I	7
never	7
do	7
as	7
thou	7
dost	7
advise,	7
this	7
once	7
I	7
will	7
take	7
thy	7
advice,	7
and	7
withdraw	7
out	7
of	7
reach	7
of	7
that	7
fury	7
thou	7
so	7
dreadest;	7
but	7
it	7
must	7
be	7
on	7
one	7
condition,	7
that	7
never,	7
in	7
life	7
or	7
in	7
death,	7
thou	7
art	7
to	7
say	7
to	7
anyone	7
that	7
I	7
retired	7
or	7
withdrew	7
from	7
this	7
danger	7
out	7
of	7
fear,	7
but	7
only	7
in	7
compliance	7
with	7
thy	7
entreaties;	7
for	7
if	7
thou	7
sayest	7
otherwise	7
thou	7
wilt	7
lie	7
therein,	7
and	7
from	7
this	7
time	7
to	7
that,	7
and	7
from	7
that	7
to	7
this,	7
I	7
give	7
thee	7
lie,	7
and	7
say	7
thou	7
liest	7
and	7
wilt	7
lie	7
every	7
time	7
thou	7
thinkest	7
or	7
sayest	7
it;	7
and	7
answer	7
me	7
not	7
again;	7
for	7
at	7
the	7
mere	7
thought	7
that	7
I	7
am	7
withdrawing	7
or	7
retiring	7
from	7
any	7
danger,	7
above	7
all	7
from	7
this,	7
which	7
does	7
seem	7
to	7
carry	7
some	7
little	7
shadow	7
of	7
fear	7
with	7
it,	7
I	7
am	7
ready	7
to	7
take	7
my	7
stand	7
here	7
and	7
await	7
alone,	7
not	7
only	7
that	7
Holy	7
Brotherhood	7
you	7
talk	7
of	7
and	7
dread,	7
but	7
the	7
brothers	7
of	7
the	7
twelve	7
tribes	7
of	7
Israel,	7
and	7
the	7
Seven	7
Maccabees,	7
and	7
Castor	7
and	7
Pollux,	7
and	7
all	7
the	7
brothers	7
and	7
brotherhoods	7
in	7
the	7
world.”	7
“Señor,”	7
replied	7
Sancho,	7
“to	7
retire	7
is	7
not	7
to	7
flee,	7
and	7
there	7
is	7
no	7
wisdom	7
in	7
waiting	7
when	7
danger	7
outweighs	7
hope,	7
and	7
it	7
is	7
the	7
part	7
of	7
wise	7
men	7
to	7
preserve	7
themselves	7
to-day	7
for	7
to-morrow,	7
and	7
not	7
risk	7
all	7
in	7
one	7
day;	7
and	7
let	7
me	7
tell	7
you,	7
though	7
I	7
am	7
a	7
clown	7
and	7
a	7
boor,	7
I	7
have	7
got	7
some	7
notion	7
of	7
what	7
they	7
call	7
safe	7
conduct;	7
so	7
repent	7
not	7
of	7
having	7
taken	7
my	7
advice,	7
but	7
mount	7
Rocinante	7
if	7
you	7
can,	7
and	7
if	7
not	7
I	7
will	7
help	7
you;	7
and	7
follow	7
me,	7
for	7
my	7
mother-wit	7
tells	7
me	7
we	7
have	7
more	7
need	7
of	7
legs	7
than	7
hands	7
just	7
now.”	7
Don	7
Quixote	7
mounted	7
without	7
replying,	7
and,	7
Sancho	7
leading	7
the	7
way	7
on	7
his	7
ass,	7
they	7
entered	7
the	7
side	7
of	7
the	7
Sierra	7
Morena,	7
which	7
was	7
close	7
by,	7
as	7
it	7
was	7
Sancho’s	7
design	7
to	7
cross	7
it	7
entirely	7
and	7
come	7
out	7
again	7
at	7
El	7
Viso	7
or	7
Almodóvar	7
del	7
Campo,	7
and	7
hide	7
for	7
some	7
days	7
among	7
its	7
crags	7
so	7
as	7
to	7
escape	7
the	7
search	7
of	7
the	7
Brotherhood	7
should	7
they	7
come	7
to	7
look	7
for	7
them.	7
He	7
was	7
encouraged	7
in	7
this	7
by	7
perceiving	7
that	7
the	7
stock	7
of	7
provisions	7
carried	7
by	7
the	7
ass	7
had	7
come	7
safe	7
out	7
of	7
the	7
fray	7
with	7
the	7
galley	7
slaves,	7
a	7
circumstance	7
that	7
he	7
regarded	7
as	7
a	7
miracle,	7
seeing	7
how	7
they	7
pillaged	7
and	7
ransacked.	7

That	7
night	7
they	7
reached	7
the	7
very	7
heart	7
of	7
the	7
Sierra	7
Morena,	7
where	7
it	7
seemed	7
prudent	7
to	7
Sancho	7
to	7
pass	7
the	7
night	7
and	7
even	7
some	7
days,	7
at	7
least	7
as	7
many	7
as	7
the	7
stores	7
he	7
carried	7
might	7
last,	7
and	7
so	7
they	7
encamped	7
between	7
two	7
rocks	7
and	7
among	7
some	7
cork	7
trees;	7
but	7
fatal	7
destiny,	7
which,	7
according	7
to	7
the	7
opinion	7
of	7
those	7
who	7
have	7
not	7
the	7
light	7
of	7
the	7
true	7
faith,	7
directs,	7
arranges,	7
and	7
settles	7
everything	7
in	7
its	7
own	7
way,	7
so	7
ordered	7
it	7
that	7
Gines	7
de	7
Pasamonte,	7
the	7
famous	7
knave	7
and	7
thief	7
who	7
by	7
the	7
virtue	7
and	7
madness	7
of	7
Don	7
Quixote	7
had	7
been	7
released	7
from	7
the	7
chain,	7
driven	7
by	7
fear	7
of	7
the	7
Holy	7
Brotherhood,	7
which	7
he	7
had	7
good	7
reason	7
to	7
dread,	7
resolved	7
to	7
take	7
hiding	7
in	7
the	7
mountains;	7
and	7
his	7
fate	7
and	7
fear	7
led	7
him	7
to	7
the	7
same	7
spot	7
to	7
which	7
Don	7
Quixote	7
and	7
Sancho	7
Panza	7
had	7
been	7
led	7
by	7
theirs,	7
just	7
in	7
time	7
to	7
recognise	7
them	7
and	7
leave	7
them	7
to	7
fall	7
asleep:	7
and	7
as	7
the	7
wicked	7
are	7
always	7
ungrateful,	7
and	7
necessity	7
leads	7
to	7
evildoing,	7
and	7
immediate	7
advantage	7
overcomes	7
all	7
considerations	7
of	7
the	7
future,	7
Gines,	7
who	7
was	7
neither	7
grateful	7
nor	7
well-principled,	7
made	7
up	7
his	7
mind	7
to	7
steal	7
Sancho	7
Panza’s	7
ass,	7
not	7
troubling	7
himself	7
about	7
Rocinante,	7
as	7
being	7
a	7
prize	7
that	7
was	7
no	7
good	7
either	7
to	7
pledge	7
or	7
sell.	7
While	7
Sancho	7
slept	7
he	7
stole	7
his	7
ass,	7
and	7
before	7
day	7
dawned	7
he	7
was	7
far	7
out	7
of	7
reach.	7

Aurora	7
made	7
her	7
appearance	7
bringing	7
gladness	7
to	7

but	7
sadness	7
to	7
Sancho	7
Panza,	7
for	7
he	7
found	7
that	7
his	7
Dapple	7
was	7
missing,	7
and	7
seeing	7
himself	7
bereft	7
of	7
him	7
he	7
began	7
the	7
saddest	7
and	7
most	7
doleful	7
lament	7
in	7
the	7
world,	7
so	7
loud	7
that	7
Don	7
Quixote	7
awoke	7
at	7
his	7
exclamations	7
and	7
heard	7
him	7
saying,	7
“O	7
son	7
of	7
my	7
bowels,	7
born	7
in	7
my	7
very	7
house,	7
my	7
children’s	7
plaything,	7
my	7
wife’s	7
joy,	7
the	7
envy	7
of	7
my	7
neighbours,	7
relief	7
of	7
my	7
burdens,	7
and	7
lastly,	7
half	7
supporter	7
of	7
myself,	7
for	7
with	7
the	7
six-and-twenty	7
maravedis	7
thou	7
didst	7
earn	7
me	7
daily	7
I	7
met	7
half	7
my	7
charges.”	7
Don	7
Quixote,	7
when	7
he	7
heard	7
the	7
lament	7
and	7
learned	7
the	7
cause,	7
consoled	7
Sancho	7
with	7
the	7
best	7
arguments	7
he	7
could,	7
entreating	7
him	7
to	7
be	7
patient,	7
and	7
promising	7
to	7
give	7
him	7
a	7
letter	7
of	7
exchange	7
ordering	7
three	7
out	7
of	7
five	7
ass-colts	7
that	7
he	7
had	7
at	7
home	7
to	7
be	7
given	7
to	7
him.	7
Sancho	7
took	7
comfort	7
at	7
this,	7
dried	7
his	7
tears,	7
suppressed	7
his	7
sobs,	7
and	7
returned	7
thanks	7
for	7
the	7
kindness	7
shown	7
him	7
by	7
Don	7
Quixote.	7
He	7
on	7
his	7
part	7
was	7
rejoiced	7
to	7
the	7
heart	7
on	7
entering	7
the	7
mountains,	7
as	7
they	7
seemed	7
to	7
him	7
to	7
be	7
just	7
the	7
place	7
for	7
the	7
adventures	7
he	7
was	7
in	7
quest	7
of.	7
They	7
brought	7
back	7
to	7
his	7
memory	7
the	7
marvellous	7
adventures	7
that	7
had	7
befallen	7
knights-errant	7
in	7
like	7
solitudes	7
and	7
wilds,	7
and	7
he	7
went	7
along	7
reflecting	7
on	7
these	7
things,	7
so	7
absorbed	7
and	7
carried	7
away	7
by	7
them	7
that	7
he	7
had	7
no	7
thought	7
for	7
anything	7
else.	7

Nor	7
had	7
Sancho	7
any	7
other	7
care	7
(now	7
that	7
he	7
fancied	7
he	7
was	7
travelling	7
in	7
a	7
safe	7
quarter)	7
than	7
to	7
satisfy	7
his	7
appetite	7
with	7
such	7
remains	7
as	7
were	7
left	7
of	7
the	7
clerical	7
spoils,	7
and	7
so	7
he	7
marched	7
behind	7
his	7
master	7
laden	7
with	7
what	7
Dapple	7
used	7
to	7
carry,	7
emptying	7
the	7
sack	7
and	7
packing	7
his	7
paunch,	7
and	7
so	7
long	7
as	7
he	7
could	7
go	7
that	7
way,	7
he	7
would	7
not	7
have	7
given	7
a	7
farthing	7
to	7
meet	7
with	7
another	7
adventure.	7
While	7
so	7
engaged	7
he	7
raised	7
his	7
eyes	7
and	7
saw	7
that	7
his	7
master	7
had	7
halted,	7
and	7
was	7
trying	7
with	7
the	7
point	7
of	7
his	7
pike	7
to	7
lift	7
some	7
bulky	7
object	7
that	7
lay	7
upon	7
the	7
ground,	7
on	7
which	7
he	7
hastened	7
to	7
join	7
him	7
and	7
help	7
him	7
if	7
it	7
were	7
needful,	7
and	7
reached	7
him	7
just	7
as	7
with	7
the	7
point	7
of	7
the	7
pike	7
he	7
was	7
raising	7
a	7
saddle-pad	7
with	7
a	7
valise	7
attached	7
to	7
it,	7
half	7
or	7
rather	7
wholly	7
rotten	7
and	7
torn;	7
but	7
so	7
heavy	7
were	7
they	7
that	7
Sancho	7
had	7
to	7
help	7
to	7
take	7
them	7
up,	7
and	7
his	7
master	7
directed	7
him	7
to	7
see	7
what	7
the	7
valise	7
contained.	7
Sancho	7
did	7
so	7
with	7
great	7
alacrity,	7
and	7
though	7
the	7
valise	7
was	7
secured	7
by	7
a	7
chain	7
and	7
padlock,	7
from	7
its	7
torn	7
and	7
rotten	7
condition	7
he	7
was	7
able	7
to	7
see	7
its	7
contents,	7
which	7
were	7
four	7
shirts	7
of	7
fine	7
holland,	7
and	7
other	7
articles	7
of	7
linen	7
no	7
less	7
curious	7
than	7
clean;	7
and	7
in	7
a	7
handkerchief	7
he	7
found	7
a	7
good	7
lot	7
of	7
gold	7
crowns,	7
and	7
as	7
soon	7
as	7
he	7
saw	7
them	7
he	7
exclaimed:	7
“Blessed	7
be	7
all	7
Heaven	7
for	7
sending	7
us	7
an	7
adventure	7
that	7
is	7
good	7
for	7
something!”	7
Searching	7
further	7
he	7
found	7
a	7
little	7
memorandum	7
book	7
richly	7
bound;	7
this	7
Don	7
Quixote	7
asked	7
of	7
him,	7
telling	7
him	7
to	7
take	7
the	7
money	7
and	7
keep	7
it	7
for	7
himself.	7
Sancho	7
kissed	7
his	7
hands	7
for	7
the	7
favour,	7
and	7
cleared	7
the	7
valise	7
of	7
its	7
linen,	7
which	7
he	7
stowed	7
away	7
in	7
the	7
provision	7
sack.	7
Considering	7
the	7
whole	7
matter,	7
Don	7
Quixote	7
observed:	7
“It	7
seems	7
to	7
me,	7
Sancho—and	7
it	7
is	7
impossible	7
it	7
can	7
be	7
otherwise—that	7
some	7
strayed	7
traveller	7
must	7
have	7
crossed	7
this	7
sierra	7
and	7
been	7
attacked	7
and	7
slain	7
by	7
footpads,	7
who	7
brought	7
him	7
to	7
this	7
remote	7
spot	7
to	7
bury	7
him.”	7
“That	7
cannot	7
be,”	7
answered	7
Sancho,	7
“because	7
if	7
they	7
had	7
been	7
robbers	7
they	7
would	7
not	7
have	7
left	7
this	7
money.”	7
“Thou	7
art	7
right,”	7
said	7
Don	7
Quixote,	7
“and	7
I	7
cannot	7
guess	7
or	7
explain	7
what	7
this	7
may	7
mean;	7
but	7
stay;	7
let	7
us	7
see	7
if	7
in	7
this	7
memorandum	7
book	7
there	7
is	7
anything	7
written	7
by	7
which	7
we	7
may	7
be	7
able	7
to	7
trace	7
out	7
or	7
discover	7
what	7
we	7
want	7
to	7
know.”	7
He	7
opened	7
it,	7
and	7
the	7
first	7
thing	7
he	7
found	7
in	7
it,	7
written	7
roughly	7
but	7
in	7
a	7
very	7
good	7
hand,	7
was	7
a	7
sonnet,	7
and	7
reading	7
it	7
aloud	7
that	7
Sancho	7
might	7
hear	7
it,	7
he	7
found	7
that	7
it	7
ran	7
as	7
follows:	7
SONNET	7
Or	7
Love	7
is	7
lacking	7
in	7
intelligence,	7
Or	7
to	7
the	7
height	7
of	7
cruelty	7
attains,	7
Or	7
else	7
it	7
is	7
my	7
doom	7
to	7
suffer	7
pains	7
Beyond	7
the	7
measure	7
due	7
to	7
my	7
offence.	7
But	7
if	7
Love	7
be	7
a	7
God,	7
it	7
follows	7

“There	7
is	7
nothing	7
to	7
be	7
learned	7
from	7
that	7
rhyme,”	7
said	7
Sancho,	7
“unless	7
by	7
that	7
clue	7
there’s	7
in	7
it,	7
one	7
may	7
draw	7
out	7
the	7
ball	7
of	7
the	7
whole	7
matter.”	7
“What	7
clue	7
is	7
there?”	7
said	7
Don	7
Quixote.	7
“I	7
thought	7
your	7
worship	7
spoke	7
of	7
a	7
clue	7
in	7
it,”	7
said	7
Sancho.	7
“I	7
only	7
said	7
Chloe,”	7
replied	7
Don	7
Quixote;	7
“and	7
that	7
no	7
doubt,	7
is	7
the	7
name	7
of	7
the	7
lady	7
of	7
whom	7
the	7
author	7
of	7
the	7
sonnet	7
complains;	7
and,	7
faith,	7
he	7
must	7
be	7
a	7
tolerable	7
poet,	7
or	7
I	7
know	7
little	7
of	7
the	7
craft.”	7
“Then	7
your	7
worship	7
understands	7
rhyming	7
too?”	7
“And	7
better	7
than	7
thou	7
thinkest,”	7
replied	7
Don	7
Quixote,	7
“as	7
thou	7
shalt	7
see	7
when	7
thou	7
carriest	7
a	7
letter	7
written	7
in	7
verse	7
from	7
beginning	7
to	7
end	7
to	7
my	7
lady	7
Dulcinea	7
del	7
Toboso,	7
for	7
I	7
would	7
have	7
thee	7
know,	7
Sancho,	7
that	7
all	7
or	7
most	7
of	7
the	7
knights-errant	7
in	7
days	7
of	7
yore	7
were	7
great	7
troubadours	7
and	7
great	7
musicians,	7
for	7
both	7
of	7
these	7
accomplishments,	7
or	7
more	7
properly	7
speaking	7
gifts,	7
are	7
the	7
peculiar	7
property	7
of	7
lovers-errant:	7
true	7
it	7
is	7
that	7
the	7
verses	7
of	7
the	7
knights	7
of	7
old	7
have	7
more	7
spirit	7
than	7
neatness	7
in	7
them.”	7
“Read	7
more,	7
your	7
worship,”	7
said	7
Sancho,	7
“and	7
you	7
will	7
find	7
something	7
that	7
will	7
enlighten	7
us.”	7
Don	7
Quixote	7
turned	7
the	7
page	7
and	7
said,	7
“This	7
is	7
prose	7
and	7
seems	7
to	7
be	7
a	7
letter.”	7
“A	7
correspondence	7
letter,	7
señor?”	7
“From	7
the	7
beginning	7
it	7
seems	7
to	7
be	7
a	7
love	7
letter,”	7
replied	7
Don	7
Quixote.	7
“Then	7
let	7
your	7
worship	7
read	7
it	7
aloud,”	7
said	7
Sancho,	7
“for	7
I	7
am	7
very	7
fond	7
of	7
love	7
matters.”	7
“With	7
all	7
my	7
heart,”	7
said	7
Don	7
Quixote,	7
and	7
reading	7
it	7
aloud	7
as	7
Sancho	7
had	7
requested	7
him,	7
he	7
found	7
it	7
ran	7
thus:	7
Thy	7
false	7
promise	7
and	7
my	7
sure	7
misfortune	7
carry	7
me	7
to	7
a	7
place	7
whence	7
the	7
news	7
of	7
my	7
death	7
will	7
reach	7
thy	7
ears	7
before	7
the	7
words	7
of	7
my	7
complaint.	7
Ungrateful	7
one,	7
thou	7
hast	7
rejected	7
me	7
for	7
one	7
more	7
wealthy,	7
but	7
not	7
more	7
worthy;	7
but	7
if	7
virtue	7
were	7
esteemed	7
wealth	7
I	7
should	7
neither	7
envy	7
the	7
fortunes	7
of	7
others	7
nor	7
weep	7
for	7
misfortunes	7
of	7
my	7
own.	7
What	7
thy	7
beauty	7
raised	7
up	7
thy	7
deeds	7
have	7
laid	7
low;	7
by	7
it	7
I	7
believed	7
thee	7
to	7
be	7
an	7
angel,	7
by	7
them	7
I	7
know	7
thou	7
art	7
a	7
woman.	7
Peace	7
be	7
with	7
thee	7
who	7
hast	7
sent	7
war	7
to	7
me,	7
and	7
Heaven	7
grant	7
that	7
the	7
deceit	7
of	7
thy	7
husband	7
be	7
ever	7
hidden	7
from	7
thee,	7
so	7
that	7
thou	7
repent	7
not	7
of	7
what	7
thou	7
hast	7
done,	7
and	7
I	7
reap	7
not	7
a	7
revenge	7
I	7
would	7
not	7
have.	7
When	7
he	7
had	7
finished	7
the	7
letter,	7
Don	7
Quixote	7
said,	7
“There	7
is	7
less	7
to	7
be	7
gathered	7
from	7
this	7
than	7
from	7
the	7
verses,	7
except	7
that	7
he	7
who	7
wrote	7
it	7
is	7
some	7
rejected	7
lover;”	7
and	7
turning	7
over	7
nearly	7
all	7
the	7
pages	7
of	7
the	7
book	7
he	7
found	7
more	7
verses	7
and	7
letters,	7
some	7
of	7
which	7
he	7
could	7
read,	7
while	7
others	7
he	7
could	7
not;	7
but	7
they	7
were	7
all	7
made	7
up	7
of	7
complaints,	7
laments,	7
misgivings,	7
desires	7
and	7
aversions,	7
favours	7
and	7
rejections,	7
some	7
rapturous,	7
some	7
doleful.	7
While	7
Don	7
Quixote	7
examined	7
the	7
book,	7
Sancho	7
examined	7
the	7
valise,	7
not	7
leaving	7
a	7
corner	7
in	7
the	7
whole	7
of	7
it	7
or	7
in	7
the	7
pad	7
that	7
he	7
did	7
not	7
search,	7
peer	7
into,	7
and	7
explore,	7
or	7
seam	7
that	7
he	7
did	7
not	7
rip,	7
or	7
tuft	7
of	7
wool	7
that	7
he	7
did	7
not	7
pick	7
to	7
pieces,	7
lest	7
anything	7
should	7
escape	7
for	7
want	7
of	7
care	7
and	7
pains;	7
so	7
keen	7
was	7
the	7
covetousness	7
excited	7
in	7
him	7
by	7
the	7
discovery	7
of	7
the	7
crowns,	7
which	7
amounted	7
to	7
near	7
a	7
hundred;	7
and	7
though	7
he	7
found	7
no	7
more	7
booty,	7
he	7
held	7
the	7
blanket	7
flights,	7
balsam	7
vomits,	7
stake	7
benedictions,	7
carriers’	7
fisticuffs,	7
missing	7
alforjas,	7
stolen	7
coat,	7
and	7
all	7
the	7
hunger,	7
thirst,	7
and	7
weariness	7
he	7
had	7
endured	7
in	7
the	7
service	7
of	7
his	7
good	7
master,	7
cheap	7
at	7
the	7
price;	7
as	7
he	7
considered	7
himself	7
more	7
than	7
fully	7
indemnified	7
for	7
all	7
by	7
the	7
payment	7
he	7
received	7
in	7
the	7
gift	7
of	7
the	7
treasure-trove.	7
The	7
Knight	7
of	7
the	7
Rueful	7
Countenance	7
was	7
still	7
very	7
anxious	7
to	7
find	7
out	7
who	7
the	7
owner	7
of	7
the	7
valise	7
could	7
be,	7
conjecturing	7
from	7
the	7
sonnet	7
and	7
letter,	7
from	7
the	7
money	7
in	7
gold,	7
and	7
from	7
the	7
fineness	7
of	7
the	7
shirts,	7
that	7
he	7
must	7
be	7
some	7
lover	7
of	7
distinction	7
whom	7
the	7
scorn	7
and	7
cruelty	7
of	7
his	7
lady	7
had	7
driven	7
to	7
some	7
desperate	7
course;	7
but	7
as	7
in	7
that	7
uninhabited	7
and	7
rugged	7
spot	7
there	7
was	7
no	7
one	7
to	7
be	7
seen	7
of	7
whom	7
he	7
could	7
inquire,	7
he	7
saw	7
nothing	7
else	7
for	7
it	7
but	7
to	7
push	7
on,	7
taking	7
whatever	7
road	7
Rocinante	7
chose—which	7
was	7
where	7
he	7
could	7
make	7
his	7
way—firmly	7
persuaded	7
that	7
among	7
these	7
wilds	7
he	7
could	7
not	7
fail	7
to	7
meet	7
some	7
rare	7
adventure.	7
As	7
he	7
went	7
along,	7
then,	7
occupied	7
with	7
these	7
thoughts,	7
he	7
perceived	7
on	7
the	7
summit	7
of	7
a	7
height	7
that	7
rose	7
before	7
their	7
eyes	7
a	7
man	7
who	7
went	7
springing	7
from	7
rock	7
to	7
rock	7
and	7
from	7
tussock	7
to	7
tussock	7
with	7
marvellous	7
agility.	7
As	7
well	7
as	7
he	7
could	7
make	7
out	7
he	7
was	7
unclad,	7
with	7
a	7
thick	7
black	7
beard,	7
long	7
tangled	7
hair,	7
and	7
bare	7
legs	7
and	7
feet,	7
his	7
thighs	7
were	7
covered	7
by	7
breeches	7
apparently	7
of	7
tawny	7
velvet	7
but	7
so	7
ragged	7
that	7
they	7
showed	7
his	7
skin	7
in	7
several	7
places.	7

He	7
was	7
bareheaded,	7
and	7
notwithstanding	7
the	7
swiftness	7
with	7
which	7
he	7
passed	7
as	7
has	7
been	7
described,	7
the	7
Knight	7
of	7
the	7
Rueful	7
Countenance	7
observed	7
and	7
noted	7
all	7
these	7
trifles,	7
and	7
though	7
he	7
made	7
the	7
attempt,	7
he	7
was	7
unable	7
to	7
follow	7
him,	7
for	7
it	7
was	7
not	7
granted	7
to	7
the	7
feebleness	7
of	7
Rocinante	7
to	7
make	7
way	7
over	7
such	7
rough	7
ground,	7
he	7
being,	7
moreover,	7
slow-paced	7
and	7
sluggish	7
by	7
nature.	7
Don	7
Quixote	7
at	7
once	7
came	7
to	7
the	7
conclusion	7
that	7
this	7
was	7
the	7
owner	7
of	7
the	7
saddle-pad	7
and	7
of	7
the	7
valise,	7
and	7
made	7
up	7
his	7
mind	7
to	7
go	7
in	7
search	7
of	7
him,	7
even	7
though	7
he	7
should	7
have	7
to	7
wander	7
a	7
year	7
in	7
those	7
mountains	7
before	7
he	7
found	7
him,	7
and	7
so	7
he	7
directed	7
Sancho	7
to	7
take	7
a	7
short	7
cut	7
over	7
one	7
side	7
of	7
the	7
mountain,	7
while	7
he	7
himself	7
went	7
by	7
the	7
other,	7
and	7
perhaps	7
by	7
this	7
means	7
they	7
might	7
light	7
upon	7
this	7
man	7
who	7
had	7
passed	7
so	7
quickly	7
out	7
of	7
their	7
sight.	7
“I	7
could	7
not	7
do	7
that,”	7
said	7
Sancho,	7
“for	7
when	7
I	7
separate	7
from	7
your	7
worship	7
fear	7
at	7
once	7
lays	7
hold	7
of	7
me,	7
and	7
assails	7
me	7
with	7
all	7
sorts	7
of	7
panics	7
and	7
fancies;	7
and	7
let	7
what	7
I	7
now	7
say	7
be	7
a	7
notice	7
that	7
from	7
this	7
time	7
forth	7
I	7
am	7
not	7
going	7
to	7
stir	7
a	7
finger’s	7
width	7
from	7
your	7
presence.”	7
“It	7
shall	7
be	7
so,”	7
said	7
he	7
of	7
the	7
Rueful	7
Countenance,	7
“and	7
I	7
am	7
very	7
glad	7
that	7
thou	7
art	7
willing	7
to	7
rely	7
on	7
my	7
courage,	7
which	7
will	7
never	7
fail	7
thee,	7
even	7
though	7
the	7
soul	7
in	7
thy	7
body	7
fail	7
thee;	7
so	7
come	7
on	7
now	7
behind	7
me	7
slowly	7
as	7
well	7
as	7
thou	7
canst,	7
and	7
make	7
lanterns	7
of	7
thine	7
eyes;	7
let	7
us	7
make	7
the	7
circuit	7
of	7
this	7
ridge;	7
perhaps	7
we	7
shall	7
light	7
upon	7
this	7
man	7
that	7
we	7
saw,	7
who	7
no	7
doubt	7
is	7
no	7
other	7
than	7
the	7
owner	7
of	7
what	7
we	7
found.”	7
To	7
which	7
Sancho	7
made	7
answer,	7
“Far	7
better	7
would	7
it	7
be	7
not	7
to	7
look	7
for	7
him,	7
for,	7
if	7
we	7
find	7
him,	7
and	7
he	7
happens	7
to	7
be	7
the	7
owner	7
of	7
the	7
money,	7
it	7
is	7
plain	7
I	7
must	7
restore	7
it;	7
it	7
would	7
be	7
better,	7
therefore,	7
that	7
without	7
taking	7
this	7
needless	7
trouble,	7
I	7
should	7
keep	7
possession	7
of	7
it	7
until	7
in	7
some	7
other	7
less	7
meddlesome	7
and	7
officious	7
way	7
the	7
real	7
owner	7
may	7
be	7
discovered;	7
and	7
perhaps	7
that	7
will	7
be	7
when	7
I	7
shall	7
have	7
spent	7
it,	7
and	7
then	7
the	7
king	7
will	7
hold	7
me	7
harmless.”	7
“Thou	7
art	7
wrong	7
there,	7
Sancho,”	7
said	7
Don	7
Quixote,	7
“for	7
now	7
that	7
we	7
have	7
a	7
suspicion	7
who	7
the	7
owner	7
is,	7
and	7
have	7
him	7
almost	7
before	7
us,	7
we	7
are	7
bound	7
to	7
seek	7
him	7
and	7
make	7
restitution;	7
and	7
if	7
we	7
do	7
not	7
see	7
him,	7
the	7
strong	7
suspicion	7
we	7
have	7
as	7
to	7
his	7
being	7
the	7
owner	7
makes	7
us	7
as	7
guilty	7
as	7
if	7
he	7
were	7
so;	7
and	7
so,	7
friend	7
Sancho,	7
let	7
not	7
our	7
search	7
for	7
him	7
give	7
thee	7
any	7
uneasiness,	7
for	7
if	7
we	7
find	7
him	7
it	7
will	7
relieve	7
mine.”	7
And	7
so	7
saying	7
he	7
gave	7
Rocinante	7
the	7
spur,	7
and	7
Sancho	7
followed	7
him	7
on	7
foot	7
and	7
loaded,	7
and	7
after	7
having	7
partly	7
made	7
the	7
circuit	7
of	7
the	7
mountain	7
they	7
found	7
lying	7
in	7
a	7
ravine,	7
dead	7
and	7
half	7
devoured	7
by	7
dogs	7
and	7
pecked	7
by	7
jackdaws,	7
a	7
mule	7
saddled	7
and	7
bridled,	7
all	7
which	7
still	7
further	7
strengthened	7
their	7
suspicion	7
that	7
he	7
who	7
had	7
fled	7
was	7
the	7
owner	7
of	7
the	7
mule	7
and	7
the	7
saddle-pad.	7

As	7
they	7
stood	7
looking	7
at	7
it	7
they	7
heard	7
a	7
whistle	7
like	7
that	7
of	7
a	7
shepherd	7
watching	7
his	7
flock,	7
and	7
suddenly	7
on	7
their	7
left	7
there	7
appeared	7
a	7
great	7
number	7
of	7
goats	7
and	7
behind	7
them	7
on	7
the	7
summit	7
of	7
the	7
mountain	7
the	7
goatherd	7
in	7
charge	7
of	7
them,	7
a	7
man	7
advanced	7
in	7
years.	7
Don	7
Quixote	7
called	7
aloud	7
to	7
him	7
and	7
begged	7
him	7
to	7
come	7
down	7
to	7
where	7
they	7
stood.	7
He	7
shouted	7
in	7
return,	7
asking	7
what	7
had	7
brought	7
them	7
to	7
that	7
spot,	7
seldom	7

never	7
trodden	7
except	7
by	7
the	7

of	7
goats,	7
or	7
of	7
the	7
wolves	7
and	7
other	7
wild	7
beasts	7
that	7
roamed	7
around.	7
Sancho	7
in	7
return	7
bade	7
him	7
come	7
down,	7
and	7
they	7
would	7
explain	7
all	7
to	7
him.	7
The	7
goatherd	7
descended,	7
and	7
reaching	7
the	7
place	7
where	7
Don	7
Quixote	7
stood,	7
he	7
said,	7
“I	7
will	7
wager	7
you	7
are	7
looking	7
at	7
that	7
hack	7
mule	7
that	7
lies	7
dead	7
in	7
the	7
hollow	7
there,	7
and,	7
faith,	7
it	7
has	7
been	7
lying	7
there	7
now	7
these	7
six	7
months;	7
tell	7
me,	7
have	7
you	7
come	7
upon	7
its	7
master	7
about	7
here?”	7
“We	7
have	7
come	7
upon	7
nobody,”	7
answered	7
Don	7
Quixote,	7
“nor	7
on	7
anything	7
except	7
a	7
saddle-pad	7
and	7
a	7
little	7
valise	7
that	7
we	7
found	7
not	7
far	7
from	7
this.”	7
“I	7
found	7
it	7
too,”	7
said	7
the	7
goatherd,	7
“but	7
I	7
would	7
not	7
lift	7
it	7
nor	7
go	7
near	7
it	7
for	7
fear	7
of	7
some	7
ill-luck	7
or	7
being	7
charged	7
with	7
theft,	7
for	7
the	7
devil	7
is	7
crafty,	7
and	7
things	7
rise	7
up	7
under	7
one’s	7
feet	7
to	7
make	7
one	7
fall	7
without	7
knowing	7
why	7
or	7
wherefore.”	7
“That’s	7
exactly	7
what	7
I	7
say,”	7
said	7
Sancho;	7
“I	7
found	7
it	7
too,	7
and	7
I	7
would	7
not	7
go	7
within	7
a	7
stone’s	7
throw	7
of	7
it;	7
there	7
I	7
left	7
it,	7
and	7
there	7
it	7
lies	7
just	7
as	7
it	7
was,	7
for	7
I	7
don’t	7
want	7
a	7
dog	7
with	7
a	7
bell.”	7
“Tell	7
me,	7
good	7
man,”	7
said	7
Don	7
Quixote,	7
“do	7
you	7
know	7
who	7
is	7
the	7
owner	7
of	7
this	7
property?”	7
“All	7
I	7
can	7
tell	7
you,”	7
said	7
the	7
goatherd,	7
“is	7
that	7
about	7
six	7
months	7
ago,	7
more	7
or	7
less,	7
there	7
arrived	7
at	7
a	7
shepherd’s	7
hut	7
three	7
leagues,	7
perhaps,	7
away	7
from	7
this,	7
a	7
youth	7
of	7
well-bred	7
appearance	7
and	7
manners,	7
mounted	7
on	7
that	7
same	7
mule	7
which	7
lies	7
dead	7
here,	7
and	7
with	7
the	7
same	7
saddle-pad	7
and	7
valise	7
which	7
you	7
say	7
you	7
found	7
and	7
did	7
not	7
touch.	7
He	7
asked	7
us	7
what	7
part	7
of	7
this	7
sierra	7
was	7
the	7
most	7
rugged	7
and	7
retired;	7
we	7
told	7
him	7
that	7
it	7
was	7
where	7
we	7
now	7
are;	7
and	7
so	7
in	7
truth	7
it	7
is,	7
for	7
if	7
you	7
push	7
on	7
half	7
a	7
league	7
farther,	7
perhaps	7
you	7
will	7
not	7
be	7
able	7
to	7
find	7
your	7
way	7
out;	7
and	7
I	7
am	7
wondering	7
how	7
you	7
have	7
managed	7
to	7
come	7
here,	7
for	7
there	7
is	7
no	7
road	7
or	7
path	7
that	7
leads	7
to	7
this	7
spot.	7
I	7
say,	7
then,	7
that	7
on	7
hearing	7
our	7
answer	7
the	7
youth	7
turned	7
about	7
and	7
made	7
for	7
the	7
place	7
we	7
pointed	7
out	7
to	7
him,	7
leaving	7
us	7
all	7
charmed	7
with	7
his	7
good	7
looks,	7
and	7
wondering	7
at	7
his	7
question	7
and	7
the	7
haste	7
with	7
which	7
we	7
saw	7
him	7
depart	7
in	7
the	7
direction	7
of	7
the	7
sierra;	7
and	7
after	7
that	7
we	7
saw	7
him	7
no	7
more,	7
until	7
some	7
days	7
afterwards	7
he	7
crossed	7
the	7
path	7
of	7
one	7
of	7
our	7
shepherds,	7
and	7
without	7
saying	7
a	7
word	7
to	7
him,	7
came	7
up	7
to	7
him	7
and	7
gave	7
him	7
several	7
cuffs	7
and	7
kicks,	7
and	7
then	7
turned	7
to	7
the	7
ass	7
with	7
our	7
provisions	7
and	7
took	7
all	7
the	7
bread	7
and	7
cheese	7
it	7
carried,	7
and	7
having	7
done	7
this	7
made	7
off	7
back	7
again	7
into	7
the	7
sierra	7
with	7
extraordinary	7
swiftness.	7
When	7
some	7
of	7
us	7
goatherds	7
learned	7
this	7
we	7
went	7
in	7
search	7
of	7
him	7
for	7
about	7
two	7
days	7
through	7
the	7
most	7
remote	7
portion	7
of	7
this	7
sierra,	7
at	7
the	7
end	7
of	7
which	7
we	7
found	7
him	7
lodged	7
in	7
the	7
hollow	7
of	7
a	7
large	7
thick	7
cork	7
tree.	7
He	7
came	7
out	7
to	7
meet	7
us	7
with	7
great	7
gentleness,	7
with	7
his	7
dress	7
now	7
torn	7
and	7
his	7
face	7
so	7
disfigured	7
and	7
burned	7
by	7
the	7
sun,	7
that	7
we	7
hardly	7
recognised	7
him	7
but	7
that	7
his	7
clothes,	7
though	7
torn,	7
convinced	7
us,	7
from	7
the	7
recollection	7
we	7
had	7
of	7
them,	7
that	7
he	7
was	7
the	7
person	7
we	7
were	7
looking	7
for.	7
He	7
saluted	7
us	7
courteously,	7
and	7
in	7
a	7
few	7
well-spoken	7
words	7
he	7
told	7
us	7
not	7
to	7
wonder	7
at	7
seeing	7
him	7
going	7
about	7
in	7
this	7
guise,	7
as	7
it	7
was	7
binding	7
upon	7
him	7
in	7
order	7
that	7
he	7
might	7
work	7
out	7
a	7
penance	7
which	7
for	7
his	7
many	7
sins	7
had	7
been	7
imposed	7
upon	7
him.	7
We	7
asked	7
him	7
to	7
tell	7
us	7
who	7
he	7
was,	7
but	7
we	7
were	7
never	7
able	7
to	7
find	7
out	7
from	7
him:	7
we	7
begged	7
of	7
him	7
too,	7
when	7
he	7
was	7
in	7
want	7
of	7
food,	7
which	7
he	7
could	7
not	7
do	7
without,	7
to	7
tell	7
us	7
where	7
we	7
should	7
find	7
him,	7
as	7
we	7
would	7
bring	7
it	7
to	7
him	7
with	7
all	7
good-will	7
and	7
readiness;	7
or	7
if	7
this	7
were	7
not	7
to	7
his	7
taste,	7
at	7
least	7
to	7
come	7
and	7
ask	7
it	7
of	7
us	7
and	7
not	7
take	7
it	7
by	7
force	7
from	7
the	7
shepherds.	7
He	7
thanked	7
us	7
for	7
the	7
offer,	7
begged	7
pardon	7
for	7
the	7
late	7
assault,	7
and	7
promised	7
for	7
the	7
future	7
to	7
ask	7
it	7
in	7
God’s	7
name	7
without	7
offering	7
violence	7
to	7
anybody.	7
As	7
for	7
fixed	7
abode,	7
he	7
said	7
he	7
had	7
no	7
other	7
than	7
that	7
which	7
chance	7
offered	7
wherever	7
night	7
might	7
overtake	7
him;	7
and	7
his	7
words	7
ended	7
in	7
an	7
outburst	7
of	7
weeping	7
so	7
bitter	7
that	7
we	7
who	7
listened	7
to	7
him	7
must	7
have	7
been	7
very	7
stones	7
had	7
we	7
not	7
joined	7
him	7
in	7
it,	7
comparing	7
what	7
we	7
saw	7
of	7
him	7
the	7
first	7
time	7
with	7
what	7
we	7
saw	7
now;	7
for,	7
as	7
I	7
said,	7
he	7
was	7
a	7
graceful	7
and	7
gracious	7
youth,	7
and	7
in	7
his	7
courteous	7
and	7
polished	7
language	7
showed	7
himself	7
to	7
be	7
of	7
good	7
birth	7
and	7
courtly	7
breeding,	7
and	7
rustics	7
as	7
we	7
were	7
that	7
listened	7
to	7
him,	7
even	7
to	7
our	7
rusticity	7
his	7
gentle	7
bearing	7
sufficed	7
to	7
make	7
it	7
plain.	7
“But	7
in	7
the	7
midst	7
of	7
his	7
conversation	7
he	7
stopped	7
and	7
became	7
silent,	7
keeping	7
his	7
eyes	7
fixed	7
upon	7
the	7
ground	7
for	7
some	7
time,	7
during	7
which	7
we	7
stood	7
still	7
waiting	7
anxiously	7
to	7
see	7
what	7
would	7
come	7
of	7
this	7
abstraction;	7
and	7
with	7
no	7
little	7
pity,	7
for	7
from	7
his	7
behaviour,	7
now	7
staring	7
at	7
the	7
ground	7
with	7
fixed	7
gaze	7
and	7
eyes	7
wide	7
open	7
without	7
moving	7
an	7
eyelid,	7
again	7
closing	7
them,	7
compressing	7
his	7
lips	7
and	7
raising	7
his	7
eyebrows,	7
we	7
could	7
perceive	7
plainly	7
that	7
a	7
fit	7
of	7
madness	7
of	7
some	7
kind	7
had	7
come	7
upon	7
him;	7
and	7
before	7
long	7
he	7
showed	7
that	7
what	7
we	7
imagined	7
was	7
the	7
truth,	7
for	7
he	7
arose	7
in	7
a	7
fury	7
from	7
the	7
ground	7
where	7
he	7
had	7
thrown	7
himself,	7
and	7
attacked	7
the	7
first	7
he	7
found	7
near	7
him	7
with	7
such	7
rage	7
and	7
fierceness	7
that	7
if	7
we	7
had	7
not	7
dragged	7
him	7
off	7
him,	7
he	7
would	7
have	7
beaten	7
or	7
bitten	7
him	7
to	7
death,	7
all	7
the	7
while	7
exclaiming,	7
‘Oh	7
faithless	7
Fernando,	7
here,	7
here	7
shalt	7
thou	7
pay	7
the	7
penalty	7
of	7
the	7
wrong	7
thou	7
hast	7
done	7
me;	7
these	7
hands	7
shall	7
tear	7
out	7
that	7
heart	7
of	7
thine,	7
abode	7
and	7
dwelling	7
of	7
all	7
iniquity,	7
but	7
of	7
deceit	7
and	7
fraud	7
above	7
all;	7
and	7
to	7
these	7
he	7
added	7
other	7
words	7
all	7
in	7
effect	7
upbraiding	7
this	7
Fernando	7
and	7
charging	7
him	7
with	7
treachery	7
and	7
faithlessness.	7
“We	7
forced	7
him	7
to	7
release	7
his	7
hold	7
with	7
no	7
little	7
difficulty,	7
and	7
without	7
another	7
word	7
he	7
left	7
us,	7
and	7
rushing	7
off	7
plunged	7
in	7
among	7
these	7
brakes	7
and	7
brambles,	7
so	7
as	7
to	7
make	7
it	7
impossible	7
for	7
us	7
to	7
follow	7
him;	7
from	7
this	7
we	7
suppose	7
that	7
madness	7
comes	7
upon	7
him	7
from	7
time	7
to	7
time,	7
and	7
that	7
someone	7
called	7
Fernando	7
must	7
have	7
done	7
him	7
a	7
wrong	7
of	7
a	7
grievous	7
nature	7
such	7
as	7
the	7
condition	7
to	7
which	7
it	7
had	7
brought	7
him	7
seemed	7
to	7
show.	7
All	7
this	7
has	7
been	7
since	7
then	7
confirmed	7
on	7
those	7
occasions,	7
and	7
they	7
have	7
been	7
many,	7
on	7
which	7
he	7
has	7
crossed	7
our	7
path,	7
at	7
one	7
time	7
to	7
beg	7
the	7
shepherds	7
to	7
give	7
him	7
some	7
of	7
the	7
food	7
they	7
carry,	7
at	7
another	7
to	7
take	7
it	7
from	7
them	7
by	7
force;	7
for	7
when	7
there	7
is	7
a	7
fit	7
of	7
madness	7
upon	7
him,	7
even	7
though	7
the	7
shepherds	7
offer	7
it	7
freely,	7
he	7
will	7
not	7
accept	7
it	7
but	7
snatches	7
it	7
from	7
them	7
by	7
dint	7
of	7
blows;	7
but	7
when	7
he	7
is	7
in	7
his	7
senses	7
he	7
begs	7
it	7
for	7
the	7
love	7
of	7
God,	7
courteously	7
and	7
civilly,	7
and	7
receives	7
it	7
with	7
many	7
thanks	7
and	7
not	7
a	7
few	7
tears.	7
And	7
to	7
tell	7
you	7
the	7
truth,	7
sirs,”	7
continued	7
the	7
goatherd,	7
“it	7
was	7
yesterday	7
that	7
we	7
resolved,	7
I	7
and	7
four	7
of	7
the	7
lads,	7
two	7
of	7
them	7
our	7
servants,	7
and	7
the	7
other	7
two	7
friends	7
of	7
mine,	7
to	7
go	7
in	7
search	7
of	7
him	7
until	7
we	7
find	7
him,	7
and	7
when	7
we	7
do	7
to	7
take	7
him,	7
whether	7
by	7
force	7
or	7
of	7
his	7
own	7
consent,	7
to	7
the	7
town	7
of	7
Almodóvar,	7
which	7
is	7
eight	7
leagues	7
from	7
this,	7
and	7
there	7
strive	7
to	7
cure	7
him	7
(if	7
indeed	7
his	7
malady	7
admits	7
of	7
a	7
cure),	7
or	7
learn	7
when	7
he	7
is	7
in	7
his	7
senses	7
who	7
he	7
is,	7
and	7
if	7
he	7
has	7
relatives	7
to	7
whom	7
we	7
may	7
give	7
notice	7
of	7
his	7
misfortune.	7
This,	7
sirs,	7
is	7
all	7
I	7
can	7
say	7
in	7
answer	7
to	7
what	7
you	7
have	7
asked	7
me;	7
and	7
be	7
sure	7
that	7
the	7
owner	7
of	7
the	7
articles	7
you	7
found	7
is	7
he	7
whom	7
you	7
saw	7
pass	7
by	7
with	7
such	7
nimbleness	7
and	7
so	7
naked.”	7
For	7
Don	7
Quixote	7
had	7
already	7
described	7
how	7
he	7
had	7
seen	7
the	7
man	7
go	7
bounding	7
along	7
the	7
mountainside,	7
and	7
he	7
was	7
now	7
filled	7
with	7
amazement	7
at	7
what	7
he	7
heard	7
from	7
the	7
goatherd,	7
and	7
more	7
eager	7
than	7
ever	7
to	7
discover	7
who	7
the	7
unhappy	7
madman	7
was;	7
and	7
in	7
his	7
heart	7
he	7
resolved,	7
as	7
he	7
had	7
done	7
before,	7
to	7
search	7
for	7
him	7
all	7
over	7
the	7
mountain,	7
not	7
leaving	7
a	7
corner	7
or	7
cave	7
unexamined	7
until	7
he	7
had	7
found	7
him.	7
But	7
chance	7
arranged	7
matters	7
better	7
than	7
he	7
expected	7
or	7
hoped,	7
for	7
at	7
that	7
very	7
moment,	7
in	7
a	7
gorge	7
on	7
the	7
mountain	7
that	7
opened	7
where	7
they	7
stood,	7
the	7
youth	7
he	7
wished	7
to	7
find	7
made	7
his	7
appearance,	7
coming	7
along	7
talking	7
to	7
himself	7
in	7
a	7
way	7
that	7
would	7
have	7
been	7
unintelligible	7
near	7
at	7
hand,	7
much	7
more	7
at	7
a	7
distance.	7
His	7
garb	7
was	7
what	7
has	7
been	7
described,	7
save	7
that	7
as	7
he	7
drew	7
near,	7
Don	7
Quixote	7
perceived	7
that	7
a	7
tattered	7
doublet	7
which	7
he	7
wore	7
was	7
amber-tanned,	7
from	7
which	7
he	7
concluded	7
that	7
one	7
who	7
wore	7
such	7
garments	7
could	7
not	7
be	7
of	7
very	7
low	7
rank.	7
Approaching	7
them,	7
the	7
youth	7
greeted	7
them	7
in	7
a	7
harsh	7
and	7
hoarse	7
voice	7
but	7
with	7
great	7
courtesy.	7
Don	7
Quixote	7
returned	7
his	7
salutation	7
with	7
equal	7
politeness,	7
and	7
dismounting	7
from	7
Rocinante	7
advanced	7
with	7
well-bred	7
bearing	7
and	7
grace	7
to	7
embrace	7
him,	7
and	7
held	7
him	7
for	7
some	7
time	7
close	7
in	7
his	7
arms	7
as	7
if	7
he	7
had	7
known	7
him	7
for	7
a	7
long	7
time.	7
The	7
other,	7
whom	7
we	7
may	7
call	7
the	7
Ragged	7
One	7
of	7
the	7
Sorry	7
Countenance,	7
as	7
Don	7
Quixote	7
was	7
of	7
the	7
Rueful,	7
after	7
submitting	7
to	7
the	7
embrace	7
pushed	7
him	7
back	7
a	7
little	7
and,	7
placing	7
his	7
hands	7
on	7
Don	7
Quixote’s	7
shoulders,	7
stood	7
gazing	7
at	7
him	7
as	7
if	7
seeking	7
to	7
see	7
whether	7
he	7
knew	7
him,	7
not	7
less	7
amazed,	7
perhaps,	7
at	7
the	7
sight	7
of	7
the	7
face,	7
figure,	7
and	7
armour	7
of	7
Don	7
Quixote	7
than	7
Don	7
Quixote	7
was	7
at	7
the	7
sight	7
of	7
him.	7
To	7
be	7
brief,	7
the	7
first	7
to	7
speak	7
after	7
embracing	7
was	7
the	7
Ragged	7
One,	7

he	7
said	7
what	7
will	7
be	7
told	7

The	7
history	7
relates	7
that	7
it	7
was	7
with	7
the	7
greatest	7
attention	7
Don	7
Quixote	7
listened	7
to	7
the	7
ragged	7
knight	7
of	7
the	7
Sierra,	7
who	7
began	7
by	7
saying:	7
“Of	7
a	7
surety,	7
señor,	7
whoever	7
you	7
are,	7
for	7
I	7
know	7
you	7
not,	7
I	7
thank	7
you	7
for	7
the	7
proofs	7
of	7
kindness	7
and	7
courtesy	7
you	7
have	7
shown	7
me,	7
and	7
would	7
I	7
were	7
in	7
a	7
condition	7
to	7
requite	7
with	7
something	7
more	7
than	7
good-will	7
that	7
which	7
you	7
have	7
displayed	7
towards	7
me	7
in	7
the	7
cordial	7
reception	7
you	7
have	7
given	7
me;	7
but	7
my	7
fate	7
does	7
not	7
afford	7
me	7
any	7
other	7
means	7
of	7
returning	7
kindnesses	7
done	7
me	7
save	7
the	7
hearty	7
desire	7
to	7
repay	7
them.”	7
“Mine,”	7
replied	7
Don	7
Quixote,	7
“is	7
to	7
be	7
of	7
service	7
to	7
you,	7
so	7
much	7
so	7
that	7
I	7
had	7
resolved	7
not	7
to	7
quit	7
these	7
mountains	7
until	7
I	7
had	7
found	7
you,	7
and	7
learned	7
of	7
you	7
whether	7
there	7
is	7
any	7
kind	7
of	7
relief	7
to	7
be	7
found	7
for	7
that	7
sorrow	7
under	7
which	7
from	7
the	7
strangeness	7
of	7
your	7
life	7
you	7
seem	7
to	7
labour;	7
and	7
to	7
search	7
for	7
you	7
with	7
all	7
possible	7
diligence,	7
if	7
search	7
had	7
been	7
necessary.	7
And	7
if	7
your	7
misfortune	7
should	7
prove	7
to	7
be	7
one	7
of	7
those	7
that	7
refuse	7
admission	7
to	7
any	7
sort	7
of	7
consolation,	7
it	7
was	7
my	7
purpose	7
to	7
join	7
you	7
in	7
lamenting	7
and	7
mourning	7
over	7
it,	7
so	7
far	7
as	7
I	7
could;	7
for	7
it	7
is	7
still	7
some	7
comfort	7
in	7
misfortune	7
to	7
find	7
one	7
who	7
can	7
feel	7
for	7
it.	7
And	7
if	7
my	7
good	7
intentions	7
deserve	7
to	7
be	7
acknowledged	7
with	7
any	7
kind	7
of	7
courtesy,	7
I	7
entreat	7
you,	7
señor,	7
by	7
that	7
which	7
I	7
perceive	7
you	7
possess	7
in	7
so	7
high	7
a	7
degree,	7
and	7
likewise	7
conjure	7
you	7
by	7
whatever	7
you	7
love	7
or	7
have	7
loved	7
best	7
in	7
life,	7
to	7
tell	7
me	7
who	7
you	7
are	7
and	7
the	7
cause	7
that	7
has	7
brought	7
you	7
to	7
live	7
or	7
die	7
in	7
these	7
solitudes	7
like	7
a	7
brute	7
beast,	7
dwelling	7
among	7
them	7
in	7
a	7
manner	7
so	7
foreign	7
to	7
your	7
condition	7
as	7
your	7
garb	7
and	7
appearance	7
show.	7
And	7
I	7
swear,”	7
added	7
Don	7
Quixote,	7
“by	7
the	7
order	7
of	7
knighthood	7
which	7
I	7
have	7
received,	7
and	7
by	7
my	7
vocation	7
of	7
knight-errant,	7
if	7
you	7
gratify	7
me	7
in	7
this,	7
to	7
serve	7
you	7
with	7
all	7
the	7
zeal	7
my	7
calling	7
demands	7
of	7
me,	7
either	7
in	7
relieving	7
your	7
misfortune	7
if	7
it	7
admits	7
of	7
relief,	7
or	7
in	7
joining	7
you	7
in	7
lamenting	7
it	7
as	7
I	7
promised	7
to	7
do.”	7
The	7
Knight	7
of	7
the	7
Thicket,	7
hearing	7
him	7
of	7
the	7
Rueful	7
Countenance	7
talk	7
in	7
this	7
strain,	7
did	7
nothing	7
but	7
stare	7
at	7
him,	7
and	7
stare	7
at	7
him	7
again,	7
and	7
again	7
survey	7
him	7
from	7
head	7
to	7
foot;	7
and	7
when	7
he	7
had	7
thoroughly	7
examined	7
him,	7
he	7
said	7
to	7
him:	7
“If	7
you	7
have	7
anything	7
to	7
give	7
me	7
to	7
eat,	7
for	7
God’s	7
sake	7
give	7
it	7
me,	7
and	7
after	7
I	7
have	7
eaten	7
I	7
will	7
do	7
all	7
you	7
ask	7
in	7
acknowledgment	7
of	7
the	7
goodwill	7
you	7
have	7
displayed	7
towards	7
me.”	7
Sancho	7
from	7
his	7
sack,	7
and	7
the	7
goatherd	7
from	7
his	7
pouch,	7
furnished	7
the	7
Ragged	7
One	7
with	7
the	7
means	7
of	7
appeasing	7
his	7
hunger,	7
and	7
what	7
they	7
gave	7
him	7
he	7
ate	7
like	7
a	7
half-witted	7
being,	7
so	7
hastily	7
that	7
he	7
took	7
no	7
time	7
between	7
mouthfuls,	7
gorging	7
rather	7
than	7
swallowing;	7
and	7
while	7
he	7
ate	7
neither	7
he	7
nor	7
they	7
who	7
observed	7
him	7
uttered	7
a	7
word.	7
As	7
soon	7
as	7
he	7
had	7
done	7
he	7
made	7
signs	7
to	7
them	7
to	7
follow	7
him,	7
which	7
they	7
did,	7
and	7
he	7
led	7
them	7
to	7
a	7
green	7
plot	7
which	7
lay	7
a	7
little	7
farther	7
off	7
round	7
the	7
corner	7
of	7
a	7
rock.	7
On	7
reaching	7
it	7
he	7
stretched	7
himself	7
upon	7
the	7
grass,	7
and	7
the	7
others	7
did	7
the	7
same,	7
all	7
keeping	7
silence,	7
until	7
the	7
Ragged	7
One,	7
settling	7
himself	7
in	7
his	7
place,	7
said:	7
“If	7
it	7
is	7
your	7
wish,	7
sirs,	7
that	7
I	7
should	7
disclose	7
in	7
a	7
few	7
words	7
the	7
surpassing	7
extent	7
of	7
my	7
misfortunes,	7
you	7
must	7
promise	7
not	7
to	7
break	7
the	7
thread	7
of	7
my	7
sad	7
story	7
with	7
any	7
question	7
or	7
other	7
interruption,	7
for	7
the	7
instant	7
you	7
do	7
so	7
the	7
tale	7
I	7
tell	7
will	7
come	7
to	7
an	7
end.”	7
These	7
words	7
of	7
the	7
Ragged	7
One	7
reminded	7
Don	7
Quixote	7
of	7
the	7
tale	7
his	7
squire	7
had	7
told	7
him,	7
when	7
he	7
failed	7
to	7
keep	7
count	7
of	7
the	7
goats	7
that	7
had	7
crossed	7
the	7
river	7
and	7
the	7
story	7
remained	7
unfinished;	7
but	7
to	7
return	7
to	7
the	7
Ragged	7
One,	7
he	7
went	7
on	7
to	7
say:	7
“I	7
give	7
you	7
this	7
warning	7
because	7
I	7
wish	7
to	7
pass	7
briefly	7
over	7
the	7
story	7
of	7
my	7
misfortunes,	7
for	7
recalling	7
them	7
to	7
memory	7
only	7
serves	7
to	7
add	7
fresh	7
ones,	7
and	7
the	7
less	7
you	7
question	7
me	7
the	7
sooner	7
shall	7
I	7
make	7
an	7
end	7
of	7
the	7
recital,	7
though	7
I	7
shall	7
not	7
omit	7
to	7
relate	7
anything	7
of	7
importance	7
in	7
order	7
fully	7
to	7
satisfy	7
your	7
curiosity.”	7
Don	7
Quixote	7
gave	7
the	7
promise	7
for	7
himself	7
and	7
the	7
others,	7
and	7
with	7
this	7
assurance	7
he	7
began	7
as	7
follows:	7
“My	7
name	7
is	7
Cardenio,	7
my	7
birthplace	7
one	7
of	7
the	7
best	7
cities	7
of	7
this	7
Andalusia,	7
my	7
family	7
noble,	7
my	7
parents	7
rich,	7
my	7
misfortune	7
so	7
great	7
that	7
my	7
parents	7
must	7
have	7
wept	7
and	7
my	7
family	7
grieved	7
over	7
it	7
without	7
being	7
able	7
by	7
their	7
wealth	7
to	7
lighten	7
it;	7
for	7
the	7
gifts	7
of	7
fortune	7
can	7
do	7
little	7
to	7
relieve	7
reverses	7
sent	7
by	7
Heaven.	7
In	7
that	7
same	7
country	7
there	7
was	7
a	7
heaven	7
in	7
which	7
love	7
had	7
placed	7
all	7
the	7
glory	7
I	7
could	7
desire;	7
such	7
was	7
the	7
beauty	7
of	7
Luscinda,	7
a	7
damsel	7
as	7
noble	7
and	7
as	7
rich	7
as	7
I,	7
but	7
of	7
happier	7
fortunes,	7
and	7
of	7
less	7
firmness	7
than	7
was	7
due	7
to	7
so	7
worthy	7
a	7
passion	7
as	7
mine.	7
This	7
Luscinda	7
I	7
loved,	7
worshipped,	7
and	7
adored	7
from	7
my	7
earliest	7
and	7
tenderest	7
years,	7
and	7
she	7
loved	7
me	7
in	7
all	7
the	7
innocence	7
and	7
sincerity	7
of	7
childhood.	7
Our	7
parents	7
were	7
aware	7
of	7
our	7
feelings,	7
and	7
were	7
not	7
sorry	7
to	7
perceive	7
them,	7
for	7
they	7
saw	7
clearly	7
that	7
as	7
they	7
ripened	7
they	7
must	7
lead	7
at	7
last	7
to	7
a	7
marriage	7
between	7
us,	7
a	7
thing	7
that	7
seemed	7
almost	7
prearranged	7
by	7
the	7
equality	7
of	7
our	7
families	7
and	7
wealth.	7
We	7
grew	7
up,	7
and	7
with	7
our	7
growth	7
grew	7
the	7
love	7
between	7
us,	7
so	7
that	7
the	7
father	7
of	7
Luscinda	7
felt	7
bound	7
for	7
propriety’s	7
sake	7
to	7
refuse	7
me	7
admission	7
to	7
his	7
house,	7
in	7
this	7
perhaps	7
imitating	7
the	7
parents	7
of	7
that	7
Thisbe	7
so	7
celebrated	7
by	7
the	7
poets,	7
and	7
this	7
refusal	7
but	7
added	7
love	7
to	7
love	7
and	7
flame	7
to	7
flame;	7
for	7
though	7
they	7
enforced	7
silence	7
upon	7
our	7
tongues	7
they	7
could	7
not	7
impose	7
it	7
upon	7
our	7
pens,	7
which	7
can	7
make	7
known	7
the	7
heart’s	7
secrets	7
to	7
a	7
loved	7
one	7
more	7
freely	7
than	7
tongues;	7
for	7
many	7
a	7
time	7
the	7
presence	7
of	7
the	7
object	7
of	7
love	7
shakes	7
the	7
firmest	7
will	7
and	7
strikes	7
dumb	7
the	7
boldest	7
tongue.	7
Ah	7
heavens!	7
how	7
many	7
letters	7
did	7
I	7
write	7
her,	7
and	7
how	7
many	7
dainty	7
modest	7
replies	7
did	7
I	7
receive!	7
how	7
many	7
ditties	7
and	7
love-songs	7
did	7
I	7
compose	7
in	7
which	7
my	7
heart	7
declared	7
and	7
made	7
known	7
its	7
feelings,	7
described	7
its	7
ardent	7
longings,	7
revelled	7
in	7
its	7
recollections	7
and	7
dallied	7
with	7
its	7
desires!	7
At	7
length	7
growing	7
impatient	7
and	7
feeling	7
my	7
heart	7
languishing	7
with	7
longing	7
to	7
see	7
her,	7
I	7
resolved	7
to	7
put	7
into	7
execution	7
and	7
carry	7
out	7
what	7
seemed	7
to	7
me	7
the	7
best	7
mode	7
of	7
winning	7
my	7
desired	7
and	7
merited	7
reward,	7
to	7
ask	7
her	7
of	7
her	7
father	7
for	7
my	7
lawful	7
wife,	7
which	7
I	7
did.	7
To	7
this	7
his	7
answer	7
was	7
that	7
he	7
thanked	7
me	7
for	7
the	7
disposition	7
I	7
showed	7
to	7
do	7
honour	7
to	7
him	7
and	7
to	7
regard	7
myself	7
as	7
honoured	7
by	7
the	7
bestowal	7
of	7
his	7
treasure;	7
but	7
that	7
as	7
my	7
father	7
was	7
alive	7
it	7
was	7
his	7
by	7
right	7
to	7
make	7
this	7
demand,	7
for	7
if	7
it	7
were	7
not	7
in	7
accordance	7
with	7
his	7
full	7
will	7
and	7
pleasure,	7
Luscinda	7
was	7
not	7
to	7
be	7
taken	7
or	7
given	7
by	7
stealth.	7
I	7
thanked	7
him	7
for	7
his	7
kindness,	7
reflecting	7
that	7
there	7
was	7
reason	7
in	7
what	7
he	7
said,	7
and	7
that	7
my	7
father	7
would	7
assent	7
to	7
it	7
as	7
soon	7
as	7
I	7
should	7
tell	7
him,	7
and	7
with	7
that	7
view	7
I	7
went	7
the	7
very	7
same	7
instant	7
to	7
let	7
him	7
know	7
what	7
my	7
desires	7
were.	7
When	7
I	7
entered	7
the	7
room	7
where	7
he	7
was	7
I	7
found	7
him	7
with	7
an	7
open	7
letter	7
in	7
his	7
hand,	7
which,	7
before	7
I	7
could	7
utter	7
a	7
word,	7
he	7
gave	7
me,	7
saying,	7
‘By	7
this	7
letter	7
thou	7
wilt	7
see,	7
Cardenio,	7
the	7
disposition	7
the	7
Duke	7
Ricardo	7
has	7
to	7
serve	7
thee.’	7
This	7
Duke	7
Ricardo,	7
as	7
you,	7
sirs,	7
probably	7
know	7
already,	7
is	7
a	7
grandee	7
of	7
Spain	7
who	7
has	7
his	7
seat	7
in	7
the	7
best	7
part	7
of	7
this	7
Andalusia.	7
I	7
took	7
and	7
read	7
the	7
letter,	7
which	7
was	7
couched	7
in	7
terms	7
so	7
flattering	7
that	7
even	7
I	7
myself	7
felt	7
it	7
would	7
be	7
wrong	7
in	7
my	7
father	7
not	7
to	7
comply	7
with	7
the	7
request	7
the	7
duke	7
made	7
in	7
it,	7
which	7
was	7
that	7
he	7
would	7
send	7
me	7
immediately	7
to	7
him,	7
as	7
he	7
wished	7
me	7
to	7
become	7
the	7
companion,	7
not	7
servant,	7
of	7
his	7
eldest	7
son,	7
and	7
would	7
take	7
upon	7
himself	7
the	7
charge	7
of	7
placing	7
me	7
in	7
a	7
position	7
corresponding	7
to	7
the	7
esteem	7
in	7
which	7
he	7
held	7
me.	7
On	7
reading	7
the	7
letter	7
my	7
voice	7
failed	7
me,	7
and	7
still	7
more	7
when	7
I	7
heard	7
my	7
father	7
say,	7
‘Two	7
days	7
hence	7
thou	7
wilt	7
depart,	7
Cardenio,	7
in	7
accordance	7
with	7
the	7
duke’s	7
wish,	7
and	7
give	7
thanks	7
to	7
God	7
who	7
is	7
opening	7
a	7
road	7
to	7
thee	7
by	7
which	7
thou	7
mayest	7
attain	7
what	7
I	7
know	7
thou	7
dost	7
deserve;	7
and	7
to	7
these	7
words	7
he	7
added	7
others	7
of	7
fatherly	7
counsel.	7
The	7
time	7
for	7
my	7
departure	7
arrived;	7
I	7
spoke	7
one	7
night	7
to	7
Luscinda,	7
I	7
told	7
her	7
all	7
that	7
had	7
occurred,	7
as	7
I	7
did	7
also	7
to	7
her	7
father,	7
entreating	7
him	7
to	7
allow	7
some	7
delay,	7
and	7
to	7
defer	7
the	7
disposal	7
of	7
her	7
hand	7
until	7
I	7
should	7
see	7
what	7
the	7
Duke	7
Ricardo	7
sought	7
of	7
me:	7
he	7
gave	7
me	7
the	7
promise,	7
and	7
she	7
confirmed	7
it	7
with	7
vows	7
and	7
swoonings	7
unnumbered.	7
Finally,	7
I	7
presented	7
myself	7
to	7
the	7
duke,	7
and	7
was	7
received	7
and	7
treated	7
by	7
him	7
so	7
kindly	7
that	7
very	7
soon	7
envy	7
began	7
to	7
do	7
its	7
work,	7
the	7
old	7
servants	7
growing	7
envious	7
of	7
me,	7
and	7
regarding	7
the	7
duke’s	7
inclination	7
to	7
show	7
me	7
favour	7
as	7
an	7
injury	7
to	7
themselves.	7
But	7
the	7
one	7
to	7
whom	7
my	7
arrival	7
gave	7
the	7
greatest	7
pleasure	7
was	7
the	7
duke’s	7
second	7
son,	7
Fernando	7
by	7
name,	7
a	7
gallant	7
youth,	7
of	7
noble,	7
generous,	7
and	7
amorous	7
disposition,	7
who	7
very	7
soon	7
made	7
so	7
intimate	7
a	7
friend	7
of	7
me	7
that	7
it	7
was	7
remarked	7
by	7
everybody;	7
for	7
though	7
the	7
elder	7
was	7
attached	7
to	7
me,	7
and	7
showed	7
me	7
kindness,	7
he	7
did	7
not	7
carry	7
his	7
affectionate	7
treatment	7
to	7
the	7
same	7
length	7
as	7
Don	7
Fernando.	7
It	7
so	7
happened,	7
then,	7
that	7
as	7
between	7
friends	7
no	7
secret	7
remains	7
unshared,	7
and	7
as	7
the	7
favour	7
I	7
enjoyed	7
with	7
Don	7
Fernando	7
had	7
grown	7
into	7
friendship,	7
he	7
made	7
all	7
his	7
thoughts	7
known	7
to	7
me,	7
and	7
in	7
particular	7
a	7
love	7
affair	7
which	7
troubled	7
his	7
mind	7
a	7
little.	7
He	7
was	7
deeply	7
in	7
love	7
with	7
a	7
peasant	7
girl,	7
a	7
vassal	7
of	7
his	7
father’s,	7
the	7
daughter	7
of	7
wealthy	7
parents,	7
and	7
herself	7
so	7
beautiful,	7
modest,	7
discreet,	7
and	7
virtuous,	7
that	7
no	7
one	7
who	7
knew	7
her	7
was	7
able	7
to	7
decide	7
in	7
which	7
of	7
these	7
respects	7
she	7
was	7
most	7
highly	7
gifted	7
or	7
most	7
excelled.	7
The	7
attractions	7
of	7
the	7
fair	7
peasant	7
raised	7
the	7
passion	7
of	7
Don	7
Fernando	7
to	7
such	7
a	7
point	7
that,	7
in	7
order	7
to	7
gain	7
his	7
object	7
and	7
overcome	7
her	7
virtuous	7
resolutions,	7
he	7
determined	7
to	7
pledge	7
his	7
word	7
to	7
her	7
to	7
become	7
her	7
husband,	7
for	7
to	7
attempt	7
it	7
in	7
any	7
other	7
way	7
was	7
to	7
attempt	7
an	7
impossibility.	7
Bound	7
to	7
him	7
as	7
I	7
was	7
by	7
friendship,	7
I	7
strove	7
by	7
the	7
best	7
arguments	7
and	7
the	7
most	7
forcible	7
examples	7
I	7
could	7
think	7
of	7
to	7
restrain	7
and	7
dissuade	7
him	7
from	7
such	7
a	7
course;	7
but	7
perceiving	7
I	7
produced	7
no	7
effect	7
I	7
resolved	7
to	7
make	7
the	7
Duke	7
Ricardo,	7
his	7
father,	7
acquainted	7
with	7
the	7
matter;	7
but	7
Don	7
Fernando,	7
being	7
sharp-witted	7
and	7
shrewd,	7
foresaw	7
and	7
apprehended	7
this,	7
perceiving	7
that	7
by	7
my	7
duty	7
as	7
a	7
good	7
servant	7
I	7
was	7
bound	7
not	7
to	7
keep	7
concealed	7
a	7
thing	7
so	7
much	7
opposed	7
to	7
the	7
honour	7
of	7
my	7
lord	7
the	7
duke;	7
and	7
so,	7
to	7
mislead	7
and	7
deceive	7
me,	7
he	7
told	7
me	7
he	7
could	7
find	7
no	7
better	7
way	7
of	7
effacing	7
from	7
his	7
mind	7
the	7
beauty	7
that	7
so	7
enslaved	7
him	7
than	7
by	7
absenting	7
himself	7
for	7
some	7
months,	7
and	7
that	7
he	7
wished	7
the	7
absence	7
to	7
be	7
effected	7
by	7
our	7
going,	7
both	7
of	7
us,	7
to	7
my	7
father’s	7
house	7
under	7
the	7
pretence,	7
which	7
he	7
would	7
make	7
to	7
the	7
duke,	7
of	7
going	7
to	7
see	7
and	7
buy	7
some	7
fine	7
horses	7
that	7
there	7
were	7
in	7
my	7
city,	7
which	7
produces	7
the	7
best	7
in	7
the	7
world.	7
When	7
I	7
heard	7
him	7
say	7
so,	7
even	7
if	7
his	7
resolution	7
had	7
not	7
been	7
so	7
good	7
a	7
one	7
I	7
should	7
have	7
hailed	7
it	7
as	7
one	7
of	7
the	7
happiest	7
that	7
could	7
be	7
imagined,	7
prompted	7
by	7
my	7
affection,	7
seeing	7
what	7
a	7
favourable	7
chance	7
and	7
opportunity	7
it	7
offered	7
me	7
of	7
returning	7
to	7
see	7
my	7
Luscinda.	7
With	7
this	7
thought	7
and	7
wish	7
I	7
commended	7
his	7
idea	7
and	7
encouraged	7
his	7
design,	7
advising	7
him	7
to	7
put	7
it	7
into	7
execution	7
as	7
quickly	7
as	7
possible,	7
as,	7
in	7
truth,	7
absence	7
produced	7
its	7
effect	7
in	7
spite	7
of	7
the	7
most	7
deeply	7
rooted	7
feelings.	7
But,	7
as	7
afterwards	7
appeared,	7
when	7
he	7
said	7
this	7
to	7
me	7
he	7
had	7
already	7
enjoyed	7
the	7
peasant	7
girl	7
under	7
the	7
title	7
of	7
husband,	7
and	7
was	7
waiting	7
for	7
an	7
opportunity	7
of	7
making	7
it	7
known	7
with	7
safety	7
to	7
himself,	7
being	7
in	7
dread	7
of	7
what	7
his	7
father	7
the	7
duke	7
would	7
do	7
when	7
he	7
came	7
to	7
know	7
of	7
his	7
folly.	7
It	7
happened,	7
then,	7
that	7
as	7
with	7
young	7
men	7
love	7
is	7
for	7
the	7
most	7
part	7
nothing	7
more	7
than	7
appetite,	7
which,	7
as	7
its	7
final	7
object	7
is	7
enjoyment,	7
comes	7
to	7
an	7
end	7
on	7
obtaining	7
it,	7
and	7
that	7
which	7
seemed	7
to	7
be	7
love	7
takes	7
to	7
flight,	7
as	7
it	7
cannot	7
pass	7
the	7
limit	7
fixed	7
by	7
nature,	7
which	7
fixes	7
no	7
limit	7
to	7
true	7
love—what	7
I	7
mean	7
is	7
that	7
after	7
Don	7
Fernando	7
had	7
enjoyed	7
this	7
peasant	7
girl	7
his	7
passion	7
subsided	7
and	7
his	7
eagerness	7
cooled,	7
and	7
if	7
at	7
first	7
he	7
feigned	7
a	7
wish	7
to	7
absent	7
himself	7
in	7
order	7
to	7
cure	7
his	7
love,	7
he	7
was	7
now	7
in	7
reality	7
anxious	7
to	7
go	7
to	7
avoid	7
keeping	7
his	7
promise.	7
“The	7
duke	7
gave	7
him	7
permission,	7
and	7
ordered	7
me	7
to	7
accompany	7
him;	7
we	7
arrived	7
at	7
my	7
city,	7
and	7
my	7
father	7
gave	7
him	7
the	7
reception	7
due	7
to	7
his	7
rank;	7
I	7
saw	7
Luscinda	7
without	7
delay,	7
and,	7
though	7
it	7
had	7
not	7
been	7
dead	7
or	7
deadened,	7
my	7
love	7
gathered	7
fresh	7
life.	7
To	7
my	7
sorrow	7
I	7
told	7
the	7
story	7
of	7
it	7
to	7
Don	7
Fernando,	7
for	7
I	7
thought	7
that	7
in	7
virtue	7
of	7
the	7
great	7
friendship	7
he	7
bore	7
me	7
I	7
was	7
bound	7
to	7
conceal	7
nothing	7
from	7
him.	7
I	7
extolled	7
her	7
beauty,	7
her	7
gaiety,	7
her	7
wit,	7
so	7
warmly,	7
that	7
my	7
praises	7
excited	7
in	7
him	7
a	7
desire	7
to	7
see	7
a	7
damsel	7
adorned	7
by	7
such	7
attractions.	7
To	7
my	7
misfortune	7
I	7
yielded	7
to	7
it,	7
showing	7
her	7
to	7
him	7
one	7
night	7
by	7
the	7
light	7
of	7
a	7
taper	7
at	7
a	7
window	7
where	7
we	7
used	7
to	7
talk	7
to	7
one	7
another.	7
As	7
she	7
appeared	7
to	7
him	7
in	7
her	7
dressing-gown,	7
she	7
drove	7
all	7
the	7
beauties	7
he	7
had	7
seen	7
until	7
then	7
out	7
of	7
his	7
recollection;	7
speech	7
failed	7
him,	7
his	7
head	7
turned,	7
he	7
was	7
spell-bound,	7
and	7
in	7
the	7
end	7
love-smitten,	7
as	7
you	7
will	7
see	7
in	7
the	7
course	7
of	7
the	7
story	7
of	7
my	7
misfortune;	7
and	7
to	7
inflame	7
still	7
further	7
his	7
passion,	7
which	7
he	7
hid	7
from	7
me	7
and	7
revealed	7
to	7
Heaven	7
alone,	7
it	7
so	7
happened	7
that	7
one	7
day	7
he	7
found	7
a	7
note	7
of	7
hers	7
entreating	7
me	7
to	7
demand	7
her	7
of	7
her	7
father	7
in	7
marriage,	7
so	7
delicate,	7
so	7
modest,	7
and	7
so	7
tender,	7
that	7
on	7
reading	7
it	7
he	7
told	7
me	7
that	7
in	7
Luscinda	7
alone	7
were	7
combined	7
all	7
the	7
charms	7
of	7
beauty	7
and	7
understanding	7
that	7
were	7
distributed	7
among	7
all	7
the	7
other	7
women	7
in	7
the	7
world.	7
It	7
is	7
true,	7
and	7
I	7
own	7
it	7
now,	7
that	7
though	7
I	7
knew	7
what	7
good	7
cause	7
Don	7
Fernando	7
had	7
to	7
praise	7
Luscinda,	7
it	7
gave	7
me	7
uneasiness	7
to	7
hear	7
these	7
praises	7
from	7
his	7
mouth,	7
and	7
I	7
began	7
to	7
fear,	7
and	7
with	7
reason	7
to	7
feel	7
distrust	7
of	7
him,	7
for	7
there	7
was	7
no	7
moment	7
when	7
he	7
was	7
not	7
ready	7
to	7
talk	7
of	7
Luscinda,	7
and	7
he	7
would	7
start	7
the	7
subject	7
himself	7
even	7
though	7
he	7
dragged	7
it	7
in	7
unseasonably,	7
a	7
circumstance	7
that	7
aroused	7
in	7
me	7
a	7
certain	7
amount	7
of	7
jealousy;	7
not	7
that	7
I	7
feared	7
any	7
change	7
in	7
the	7
constancy	7
or	7
faith	7
of	7
Luscinda;	7
but	7
still	7
my	7
fate	7
led	7
me	7
to	7
forebode	7
what	7
she	7
assured	7
me	7
against.	7
Don	7
Fernando	7
contrived	7
always	7
to	7
read	7
the	7
letters	7
I	7
sent	7
to	7
Luscinda	7
and	7
her	7
answers	7
to	7
me,	7
under	7
the	7
pretence	7
that	7
he	7
enjoyed	7
the	7
wit	7
and	7
sense	7
of	7
both.	7
It	7
so	7
happened,	7
then,	7
that	7
Luscinda	7
having	7
begged	7
of	7
me	7
a	7
book	7
of	7
chivalry	7
to	7
read,	7
one	7
that	7
she	7
was	7
very	7
fond	7
of,	7
Amadis	7
of	7
Gaul—”	7
Don	7
Quixote	7
no	7
sooner	7
heard	7
a	7
book	7
of	7
chivalry	7
mentioned,	7
than	7
he	7
said:	7
“Had	7
your	7
worship	7
told	7
me	7
at	7
the	7
beginning	7
of	7
your	7
story	7
that	7
the	7
Lady	7
Luscinda	7
was	7
fond	7
of	7
books	7
of	7
chivalry,	7
no	7
other	7
laudation	7
would	7
have	7
been	7
requisite	7
to	7
impress	7
upon	7
me	7
the	7
superiority	7
of	7
her	7
understanding,	7
for	7
it	7
could	7
not	7
have	7
been	7
of	7
the	7
excellence	7
you	7
describe	7
had	7
a	7
taste	7
for	7
such	7
delightful	7
reading	7
been	7
wanting;	7
so,	7
as	7
far	7
as	7
I	7
am	7
concerned,	7
you	7
need	7
waste	7
no	7
more	7
words	7
in	7
describing	7
her	7
beauty,	7
worth,	7
and	7
intelligence;	7
for,	7
on	7
merely	7
hearing	7
what	7
her	7
taste	7
was,	7
I	7
declare	7
her	7
to	7
be	7
the	7
most	7
beautiful	7
and	7
the	7
most	7
intelligent	7
woman	7
in	7
the	7
world;	7
and	7
I	7
wish	7
your	7
worship	7
had,	7
along	7
with	7
Amadis	7
of	7
Gaul,	7
sent	7
her	7
the	7
worthy	7
Don	7
Rugel	7
of	7
Greece,	7
for	7
I	7
know	7
the	7
Lady	7
Luscinda	7
would	7
greatly	7
relish	7
Daraida	7
and	7
Garaya,	7
and	7
the	7
shrewd	7
sayings	7
of	7
the	7
shepherd	7
Darinel,	7
and	7
the	7
admirable	7
verses	7
of	7
his	7
bucolics,	7
sung	7
and	7
delivered	7
by	7
him	7
with	7
such	7
sprightliness,	7
wit,	7
and	7
ease;	7
but	7
a	7
time	7
may	7
come	7
when	7
this	7
omission	7
can	7
be	7
remedied,	7
and	7
to	7
rectify	7
it	7
nothing	7
more	7
is	7
needed	7
than	7
for	7
your	7
worship	7
to	7
be	7
so	7
good	7
as	7
to	7
come	7
with	7
me	7
to	7
my	7
village,	7
for	7
there	7
I	7
can	7
give	7
you	7
more	7
than	7
three	7
hundred	7
books	7
which	7
are	7
the	7
delight	7
of	7
my	7
soul	7
and	7
the	7
entertainment	7
of	7
my	7
life;—though	7
it	7
occurs	7
to	7
me	7
that	7
I	7
have	7
not	7
got	7
one	7
of	7
them	7
now,	7
thanks	7
to	7
the	7
spite	7
of	7
wicked	7
and	7
envious	7
enchanters;—but	7
pardon	7
me	7
for	7
having	7
broken	7
the	7
promise	7
we	7
made	7
not	7
to	7
interrupt	7
your	7
discourse;	7
for	7
when	7
I	7
hear	7
chivalry	7
or	7
knights-errant	7
mentioned,	7
I	7
can	7
no	7
more	7
help	7
talking	7
about	7
them	7
than	7
the	7
rays	7
of	7
the	7
sun	7
can	7
help	7
giving	7
heat,	7
or	7
those	7
of	7
the	7
moon	7
moisture;	7
pardon	7
me,	7
therefore,	7
and	7
proceed,	7
for	7
that	7
is	7
more	7
to	7
the	7
purpose	7
now.”	7
While	7
Don	7
Quixote	7
was	7
saying	7
this,	7
Cardenio	7
allowed	7
his	7
head	7
to	7
fall	7
upon	7
his	7
breast,	7
and	7
seemed	7
plunged	7
in	7
deep	7
thought;	7
and	7
though	7
twice	7
Don	7
Quixote	7
bade	7
him	7
go	7
on	7
with	7
his	7
story,	7
he	7
neither	7
looked	7
up	7
nor	7
uttered	7
a	7
word	7
in	7
reply;	7
but	7
after	7
some	7
time	7
he	7
raised	7
his	7
head	7
and	7
said,	7
“I	7
cannot	7
get	7
rid	7
of	7
the	7
idea,	7
nor	7
will	7
anyone	7
in	7
the	7
world	7
remove	7
it,	7
or	7
make	7
me	7
think	7
otherwise—and	7
he	7
would	7
be	7
a	7
blockhead	7
who	7
would	7
hold	7
or	7
believe	7
anything	7
else	7
than	7
that	8
arrant	8
knave	8
Master	8
Elisabad	8
made	8
free	8
with	8
Queen	8
Madasima.”	8
“That	8
is	8
not	8
true,	8
by	8
all	8
that’s	8
good,”	8
said	8
Don	8
Quixote	8
in	8
high	8
wrath,	8
turning	8
upon	8
him	8
angrily,	8
as	8
his	8
way	8
was;	8
“and	8
it	8
is	8
a	8
very	8
great	8
slander,	8
or	8
rather	8
villainy.	8
Queen	8
Madasima	8
was	8
a	8
very	8
illustrious	8
lady,	8
and	8
it	8
is	8
not	8
to	8
be	8
supposed	8
that	8
so	8
exalted	8
a	8
princess	8
would	8
have	8
made	8
free	8
with	8
a	8
quack;	8
and	8
whoever	8
maintains	8
the	8
contrary	8
lies	8
like	8
a	8
great	8
scoundrel,	8
and	8
I	8
will	8
give	8
him	8
to	8
know	8
it,	8
on	8
foot	8
or	8
on	8
horseback,	8
armed	8
or	8
unarmed,	8
by	8
night	8
or	8
by	8
day,	8
or	8
as	8
he	8
likes	8
best.”	8
Cardenio	8
was	8
looking	8
at	8
him	8
steadily,	8
and	8
his	8
mad	8
fit	8
having	8
now	8
come	8
upon	8
him,	8
he	8
had	8
no	8
disposition	8
to	8
go	8
on	8
with	8
his	8
story,	8
nor	8
would	8
Don	8
Quixote	8
have	8
listened	8
to	8
it,	8
so	8
much	8
had	8
what	8
he	8
had	8
heard	8
about	8
Madasima	8
disgusted	8
him.	8
Strange	8
to	8
say,	8
he	8
stood	8
up	8
for	8
her	8
as	8
if	8
she	8
were	8
in	8
earnest	8
his	8
veritable	8
born	8
lady;	8
to	8
such	8
a	8
pass	8
had	8
his	8
unholy	8
books	8
brought	8
him.	8
Cardenio,	8
then,	8
being,	8
as	8
I	8
said,	8
now	8
mad,	8
when	8
he	8
heard	8
himself	8
given	8
the	8
lie,	8
and	8
called	8
a	8
scoundrel	8
and	8
other	8
insulting	8
names,	8
not	8
relishing	8
the	8
jest,	8
snatched	8
up	8
a	8
stone	8
that	8
he	8
found	8
near	8
him,	8
and	8
with	8
it	8
delivered	8
such	8
a	8
blow	8
on	8
Don	8
Quixote’s	8
breast	8
that	8
he	8
laid	8
him	8
on	8
his	8
back.	8
Sancho	8
Panza,	8
seeing	8
his	8
master	8
treated	8
in	8
this	8
fashion,	8
attacked	8
the	8
madman	8
with	8
his	8
closed	8
fist;	8
but	8
the	8
Ragged	8
One	8
received	8
him	8
in	8
such	8
a	8
way	8
that	8
with	8
a	8
blow	8
of	8
his	8
fist	8
he	8
stretched	8
him	8
at	8
his	8
feet,	8
and	8
then	8
mounting	8
upon	8
him	8
crushed	8
his	8
ribs	8
to	8
his	8
own	8
satisfaction;	8
the	8
goatherd,	8
who	8
came	8
to	8
the	8
rescue,	8
shared	8
the	8
same	8
fate;	8
and	8
having	8
beaten	8
and	8
pummelled	8
them	8
all	8
he	8
left	8
them	8
and	8
quietly	8
withdrew	8
to	8
his	8
hiding-place	8
on	8
the	8
mountain.	8
Sancho	8
rose,	8
and	8
with	8
the	8
rage	8
he	8
felt	8
at	8
finding	8
himself	8
so	8
belaboured	8
without	8
deserving	8
it,	8
ran	8
to	8
take	8
vengeance	8
on	8
the	8
goatherd,	8
accusing	8
him	8
of	8
not	8
giving	8
them	8
warning	8
that	8
this	8
man	8
was	8
at	8
times	8
taken	8
with	8
a	8
mad	8
fit,	8
for	8
if	8
they	8
had	8
known	8
it	8
they	8
would	8
have	8
been	8
on	8
their	8
guard	8
to	8
protect	8
themselves.	8
The	8
goatherd	8
replied	8
that	8
he	8
had	8
said	8
so,	8
and	8
that	8
if	8
he	8
had	8
not	8
heard	8
him,	8
that	8
was	8
no	8
fault	8
of	8
his.	8
Sancho	8
retorted,	8
and	8
the	8
goatherd	8
rejoined,	8
and	8
the	8
altercation	8
ended	8
in	8
their	8
seizing	8
each	8
other	8
by	8
the	8
beard,	8
and	8
exchanging	8
such	8
fisticuffs	8
that	8
if	8
Don	8
Quixote	8
had	8
not	8
made	8
peace	8
between	8
them,	8
they	8
would	8
have	8
knocked	8
one	8
another	8
to	8
pieces.	8
“Leave	8
me	8
alone,	8
Sir	8
Knight	8
of	8
the	8
Rueful	8
Countenance,”	8
said	8
Sancho,	8
grappling	8
with	8
the	8
goatherd,	8
“for	8
of	8
this	8
fellow,	8
who	8
is	8
a	8
clown	8
like	8
myself,	8
and	8
no	8
dubbed	8
knight,	8
I	8
can	8
safely	8
take	8
satisfaction	8
for	8
the	8
affront	8
he	8
has	8
offered	8
me,	8
fighting	8
with	8
him	8
hand	8
to	8
hand	8
like	8
an	8
honest	8
man.”	8
“That	8
is	8
true,”	8
said	8
Don	8
Quixote,	8
“but	8
I	8
know	8
that	8
he	8
is	8
not	8
to	8
blame	8
for	8
what	8
has	8
happened.”	8
With	8
this	8
he	8
pacified	8
them,	8
and	8
again	8
asked	8
the	8
goatherd	8
if	8
it	8
would	8
be	8
possible	8
to	8
find	8
Cardenio,	8
as	8
he	8
felt	8
the	8
greatest	8
anxiety	8
to	8
know	8
the	8
end	8
of	8
his	8
story.	8
The	8
goatherd	8
told	8
him,	8
as	8
he	8
had	8
told	8
him	8
before,	8
that	8
there	8
was	8
no	8
knowing	8
of	8
a	8
certainty	8
where	8
his	8
lair	8
was;	8
but	8
that	8
if	8
he	8
wandered	8
about	8
much	8
in	8
that	8
neighbourhood	8
he	8
could	8
not	8
fail	8
to	8
fall	8
in	8
with	8
him	8
either	8
in	8
or	8
out	8
of	8
his	8
senses.	8

Don	8
Quixote	8
took	8
leave	8
of	8
the	8
goatherd,	8
and	8
once	8
more	8
mounting	8
Rocinante	8
bade	8
Sancho	8
follow	8
him,	8
which	8
he	8
having	8
no	8
ass,	8
did	8
very	8
discontentedly.	8
They	8
proceeded	8
slowly,	8
making	8
their	8
way	8
into	8
the	8
most	8
rugged	8
part	8
of	8
the	8
mountain,	8
Sancho	8
all	8
the	8
while	8
dying	8
to	8
have	8
a	8
talk	8
with	8
his	8
master,	8
and	8
longing	8
for	8
him	8
to	8
begin,	8
so	8
that	8
there	8
should	8
be	8
no	8
breach	8
of	8
the	8
injunction	8
laid	8
upon	8
him;	8
but	8
unable	8
to	8
keep	8
silence	8
so	8
long	8
he	8
said	8
to	8
him:	8
“Señor	8
Don	8
Quixote,	8
give	8
me	8
your	8
worship’s	8
blessing	8
and	8
dismissal,	8
for	8
I’d	8
like	8
to	8
go	8
home	8
at	8
once	8
to	8
my	8
wife	8
and	8
children	8
with	8
whom	8
I	8
can	8
at	8
any	8
rate	8
talk	8
and	8
converse	8
as	8
much	8
as	8
I	8
like;	8
for	8
to	8
want	8
me	8
to	8
go	8
through	8
these	8
solitudes	8
day	8
and	8
night	8
and	8
not	8
speak	8
to	8
you	8
when	8
I	8
have	8
a	8
mind	8
is	8
burying	8
me	8
alive.	8
If	8
luck	8
would	8
have	8
it	8
that	8
animals	8
spoke	8
as	8
they	8
did	8
in	8
the	8
days	8
of	8
Guisopete,	8
it	8
would	8
not	8
be	8
so	8
bad,	8
because	8
I	8
could	8
talk	8
to	8
Rocinante	8
about	8
whatever	8
came	8
into	8
my	8
head,	8
and	8
so	8
put	8
up	8
with	8
my	8
ill-fortune;	8
but	8
it	8
is	8
a	8
hard	8
case,	8
and	8
not	8
to	8
be	8
borne	8
with	8
patience,	8
to	8
go	8
seeking	8
adventures	8
all	8
one’s	8
life	8
and	8
get	8
nothing	8
but	8
kicks	8
and	8
blanketings,	8
brickbats	8
and	8
punches,	8
and	8
with	8
all	8
this	8
to	8
have	8
to	8
sew	8
up	8
one’s	8
mouth	8
without	8
daring	8
to	8
say	8
what	8
is	8
in	8
one’s	8
heart,	8
just	8
as	8
if	8
one	8
were	8
dumb.”	8
“I	8
understand	8
thee,	8
Sancho,”	8
replied	8
Don	8
Quixote;	8
“thou	8
art	8
dying	8
to	8
have	8
the	8
interdict	8
I	8
placed	8
upon	8
thy	8
tongue	8
removed;	8
consider	8
it	8
removed,	8
and	8
say	8
what	8
thou	8
wilt	8
while	8
we	8
are	8
wandering	8
in	8
these	8
mountains.”	8
“So	8
be	8
it,”	8
said	8
Sancho;	8
“let	8
me	8
speak	8
now,	8
for	8
God	8
knows	8
what	8
will	8
happen	8
by-and-by;	8
and	8
to	8
take	8
advantage	8
of	8
the	8
permit	8
at	8
once,	8
I	8
ask,	8
what	8
made	8
your	8
worship	8
stand	8
up	8
so	8
for	8
that	8
Queen	8
Majimasa,	8
or	8
whatever	8
her	8
name	8
is,	8
or	8
what	8
did	8
it	8
matter	8
whether	8
that	8
abbot	8
was	8
a	8
friend	8
of	8
hers	8
or	8
not?	8
for	8
if	8
your	8
worship	8
had	8
let	8
that	8
pass—and	8
you	8
were	8
not	8
a	8
judge	8
in	8
the	8
matter—it	8
is	8
my	8
belief	8
the	8
madman	8
would	8
have	8
gone	8
on	8
with	8
his	8
story,	8
and	8
the	8
blow	8
of	8
the	8
stone,	8
and	8
the	8
kicks,	8
and	8
more	8
than	8
half	8
a	8
dozen	8
cuffs	8
would	8
have	8
been	8
escaped.”	8
“In	8
faith,	8
Sancho,”	8
answered	8
Don	8
Quixote,	8
“if	8
thou	8
knewest	8
as	8
I	8
do	8
what	8
an	8
honourable	8
and	8
illustrious	8
lady	8
Queen	8
Madasima	8
was,	8
I	8
know	8
thou	8
wouldst	8
say	8
I	8
had	8
great	8
patience	8
that	8
I	8
did	8
not	8
break	8
in	8
pieces	8
the	8
mouth	8
that	8
uttered	8
such	8
blasphemies,	8
for	8
a	8
very	8
great	8
blasphemy	8
it	8
is	8
to	8
say	8
or	8
imagine	8
that	8
a	8
queen	8
has	8
made	8
free	8
with	8
a	8
surgeon.	8
The	8
truth	8
of	8
the	8
story	8
is	8
that	9
Master	9
Elisabad	9
whom	9
the	9
madman	9
mentioned	9
was	9
a	9
man	9
of	9
great	9
prudence	9
and	9
sound	9
judgment,	9
and	9
served	9
as	9
governor	9
and	9
physician	9
to	9
the	9
queen,	9
but	9
to	9
suppose	9
that	9
she	9
was	9
his	9
mistress	9
is	9
nonsense	9
deserving	9
very	9
severe	9
punishment;	9
and	9
as	9
a	9
proof	9
that	9
Cardenio	9
did	9
not	9
know	9
what	9
he	9
was	9
saying,	9
remember	9
when	9
he	9
said	9
it	9
he	9
was	9
out	9
of	9
his	9
wits.”	9
“That	9
is	9
what	9
I	9
say,”	9
said	9
Sancho;	9
“there	9
was	9
no	9
occasion	9
for	9
minding	9
the	9
words	9
of	9
a	9
madman;	9
for	9
if	9
good	9
luck	9
had	9
not	9
helped	9
your	9
worship,	9
and	9
he	9
had	9
sent	9
that	9
stone	9
at	9
your	9
head	9
instead	9
of	9
at	9
your	9
breast,	9
a	9
fine	9
way	9
we	9
should	9
have	9
been	9
in	9
for	9
standing	9
up	9
for	9
my	9
lady	9
yonder,	9
God	9
confound	9
her!	9
And	9
then,	9
would	9
not	9
Cardenio	9
have	9
gone	9
free	9
as	9
a	9
madman?”	9
“Against	9
men	9
in	9
their	9
senses	9
or	9
against	9
madmen,”	9
said	9
Don	9
Quixote,	9
“every	9
knight-errant	9
is	9
bound	9
to	9
stand	9
up	9
for	9
the	9
honour	9
of	9
women,	9
whoever	9
they	9
may	9
be,	9
much	9
more	9
for	9
queens	9
of	9
such	9
high	9
degree	9
and	9
dignity	9
as	9
Queen	9
Madasima,	9
for	9
whom	9
I	9
have	9
a	9
particular	9
regard	9
on	9
account	9
of	9
her	9
amiable	9
qualities;	9
for,	9
besides	9
being	9
extremely	9
beautiful,	9
she	9
was	9
very	9
wise,	9
and	9
very	9
patient	9
under	9
her	9
misfortunes,	9
of	9
which	9
she	9
had	9
many;	9
and	9
the	9
counsel	9
and	9
society	9
of	9
the	9
Master	9
Elisabad	9
were	9
a	9
great	9
help	9
and	9
support	9
to	9
her	9
in	9
enduring	9
her	9
afflictions	9
with	9
wisdom	9
and	9
resignation;	9
hence	9
the	9
ignorant	9
and	9
ill-disposed	9
vulgar	9
took	9
occasion	9
to	9
say	9
and	9
think	9
that	9
she	9
was	9
his	9
mistress;	9
and	9
they	9
lie,	9
I	9
say	9
it	9
once	9
more,	9
and	9
will	9
lie	9
two	9
hundred	9
times	9
more,	9
all	9
who	9
think	9
and	9
say	9
so.”	9
“I	9
neither	9
say	9
nor	9
think	9
so,”	9
said	9
Sancho;	9
“let	9
them	9
look	9
to	9
it;	9
with	9
their	9
bread	9
let	9
them	9
eat	9
it;	9
they	9
have	9
rendered	9
account	9
to	9
God	9
whether	9
they	9
misbehaved	9
or	9
not;	9
I	9
come	9
from	9
my	9
vineyard,	9
I	9
know	9
nothing;	9
I	9
am	9
not	9
fond	9
of	9
prying	9
into	9
other	9
men’s	9
lives;	9
he	9
who	9
buys	9
and	9
lies	9
feels	9
it	9
in	9
his	9
purse;	9
moreover,	9
naked	9
was	9
I	9
born,	9
naked	9
I	9
find	9
myself,	9
I	9
neither	9
lose	9
nor	9
gain;	9
but	9
if	9
they	9
did,	9
what	9
is	9
that	9
to	9
me?	9
many	9
think	9
there	9
are	9
flitches	9
where	9
there	9
are	9
no	9
hooks;	9
but	9
who	9
can	9
put	9
gates	9
to	9
the	9
open	9
plain?	9
moreover	9
they	9
said	9
of	9
God—”	9
“God	9
bless	9
me,”	9
said	9
Don	9
Quixote,	9
“what	9
a	9
set	9
of	9
absurdities	9
thou	9
art	9
stringing	9
together!	9
What	9
has	9
what	9
we	9

got	9
to	9
do	9
with	9
the	9
proverbs	9
thou	9
art	9
threading	9
one	9
after	9
the	9
other?	9
for	9
God’s	9
sake	9
hold	9
thy	9
tongue,	9
Sancho,	9
and	9
henceforward	9
keep	9
to	9
prodding	9
thy	9
ass	9
and	9
don’t	9
meddle	9
in	9
what	9
does	9
not	9
concern	9
thee;	9
and	9
understand	9
with	9
all	9
thy	9
five	9
senses	9
that	9
everything	9
I	9
have	9
done,	9
am	9
doing,	9
or	9
shall	9
do,	9
is	9
well	9
founded	9
on	9
reason	9
and	9
in	9
conformity	9
with	9
the	9
rules	9
of	9
chivalry,	9
for	9
I	9
understand	9
them	9
better	9
than	9
all	9
the	9
world	9
that	9
profess	9
them.”	9
“Señor,”	9
replied	9
Sancho,	9
“is	9
it	9
a	9
good	9
rule	9
of	9
chivalry	9
that	9
we	9
should	9
go	9
astray	9
through	9
these	9
mountains	9
without	9

looking	9

when	9

take	9

to	9

your	9
worship’s	9

them	9
altogether	9

us?”	9

“Peace,	9
I	9
say	9
again,	9
Sancho,”	9
said	9
Don	9
Quixote,	9
“for	9
let	9
me	9
tell	9
thee	9
it	9
is	9
not	9
so	9
much	9
the	9
desire	9
of	9
finding	9
that	9
madman	9
that	9
leads	9
me	9
into	9
these	9
regions	9
as	9
that	9
which	9
I	9
have	9
of	9
performing	9
among	9
them	9
an	9
achievement	9
wherewith	9
I	9
shall	9
win	9
eternal	9
name	9
and	9
fame	9
throughout	9
the	9
known	9
world;	9
and	9
it	9
shall	9
be	9
such	9
that	9
I	9
shall	9
thereby	9
set	9
the	9
seal	9
on	9
all	9
that	9
can	9
make	9
a	9
knight-errant	9
perfect	9
and	9
famous.”	9
“And	9
is	9
it	9
very	9
perilous,	9
this	9
achievement?”	9
“No,”	9
replied	9
he	9
of	9
the	9
Rueful	9
Countenance;	9
“though	9
it	9
may	9
be	9
in	9
the	9
dice	9
that	9
we	9
may	9
throw	9
deuce-ace	9
instead	9
of	9
sixes;	9
but	9
all	9
will	9
depend	9
on	9
thy	9
diligence.”	9
“On	9
my	9
diligence!”	9
said	9
Sancho.	9
“Yes,”	9
said	9
Don	9
Quixote,	9
“for	9
if	9
thou	9
dost	9
return	9
soon	9
from	9
the	9
place	9
where	9
I	9
mean	9
to	9
send	9
thee,	9
my	9
penance	9
will	9
be	9
soon	9
over,	9
and	9
my	9
glory	9
will	9
soon	9
begin.	9
But	9
as	9
it	9
is	9
not	9
right	9
to	9
keep	9
thee	9
any	9
longer	9
in	9
suspense,	9
waiting	9
to	9
see	9
what	9
comes	9
of	9
my	9
words,	9
I	9
would	9
have	9
thee	9
know,	9
Sancho,	9
that	9
the	9
famous	9
Amadis	9
of	9
Gaul	9
was	9
one	9
of	9
the	9
most	9
perfect	9
knights-errant—I	9
am	9
wrong	9
to	9
say	9
he	9
was	9
one;	9
he	9
stood	9
alone,	9
the	9
first,	9
the	9
only	9
one,	9
the	9
lord	9
of	9
all	9
that	9
were	9
in	9
the	9
world	9
in	9
his	9
time.	9
A	9
fig	9
for	9
Don	9
Belianis,	9
and	9
for	9
all	9
who	9
say	9
he	9
equalled	9
him	9
in	9
any	9
respect,	9
for,	9
my	9
oath	9
upon	9
it,	9
they	9
are	9
deceiving	9
themselves!	9
I	9
say,	9
too,	9
that	9
when	9
a	9
painter	9
desires	9
to	9
become	9
famous	9
in	9
his	9
art	9
he	9
endeavours	9
to	9
copy	9
the	9
originals	9
of	9
the	9
rarest	9
painters	9
that	9
he	9
knows;	9
and	9
the	9
same	9
rule	9
holds	9
good	9
for	9
all	9
the	9
most	9
important	9
crafts	9
and	9
callings	9
that	9
serve	9
to	9
adorn	9
a	9
state;	9
thus	9
must	9
he	9
who	9
would	9
be	9
esteemed	9
prudent	9
and	9
patient	9
imitate	9
Ulysses,	9
in	9
whose	9
person	9
and	9
labours	9
Homer	9
presents	9
to	9
us	9
a	9
lively	9
picture	9
of	9
prudence	9
and	9
patience;	9
as	9
Virgil,	9
too,	9
shows	9
us	9
in	9
the	9
person	9
of	9
Æneas	9
the	9
virtue	9
of	9
a	9
pious	9
son	9
and	9
the	9
sagacity	9
of	9
a	9
brave	9
and	9
skilful	9
captain;	9
not	9
representing	9
or	9
describing	9
them	9
as	9
they	9
were,	9
but	9
as	9
they	9
ought	9
to	9
be,	9
so	9
as	9
to	9
leave	9
the	9
example	9
of	9
their	9
virtues	9
to	9
posterity.	9
In	9
the	9
same	9
way	9
Amadis	9
was	9
the	9
polestar,	9
day-star,	9
sun	9
of	9
valiant	9
and	9
devoted	9
knights,	9
whom	9
all	9
we	9
who	9
fight	9
under	9
the	9
banner	9
of	9
love	9
and	9
chivalry	9
are	9
bound	9
to	9
imitate.	9
This,	9
then,	9
being	9
so,	9
I	9
consider,	9
friend	9
Sancho,	9
that	9
the	9
knight-errant	9
who	9
shall	9
imitate	9
him	9
most	9
closely	9
will	9
come	9
nearest	9
to	9
reaching	9
the	9
perfection	9
of	9
chivalry.	9
Now	9
one	9
of	9
the	9
instances	9
in	9
which	9
this	9
knight	9
most	9
conspicuously	9
showed	9
his	9
prudence,	9
worth,	9
valour,	9
endurance,	9
fortitude,	9
and	9
love,	9
was	9
when	9
he	9
withdrew,	9
rejected	9
by	9
the	9
Lady	9
Oriana,	9
to	9
do	9
penance	9
upon	9
the	9
Peña	9
Pobre,	9
changing	9
his	9
name	9
into	9
that	9
of	9
Beltenebros,	9
a	9
name	9
assuredly	9
significant	9
and	9
appropriate	9
to	9
the	9
life	9
which	9
he	9
had	9
voluntarily	9
adopted.	9
So,	9
as	9
it	9
is	9
easier	9
for	9
me	9
to	9
imitate	9
him	9
in	9
this	9
than	9
in	9
cleaving	9
giants	9
asunder,	9
cutting	9
off	9
serpents’	9
heads,	9
slaying	9
dragons,	9
routing	9
armies,	9
destroying	9
fleets,	9
and	9
breaking	9
enchantments,	9
and	9
as	9
this	9
place	9
is	9
so	9
well	9
suited	9
for	9
a	9
similar	9
purpose,	9
I	9
must	9
not	9
allow	9
the	9
opportunity	9
to	9
escape	9
which	9
now	9
so	9
conveniently	9
offers	9
me	9
its	9
forelock.”	9
“What	9
is	9
it	9
in	9
reality,”	9
said	9
Sancho,	9
“that	9
your	9
worship	9
means	9
to	9
do	9
in	9
such	9
an	9
out-of-the-way	9
place	9
as	9
this?”	9
“Have	9
I	9
not	9
told	9
thee,”	9
answered	9
Don	9
Quixote,	9
“that	9
I	9
mean	9
to	9
imitate	9
Amadis	9
here,	9
playing	9
the	9
victim	9
of	9
despair,	9
the	9
madman,	9
the	9
maniac,	9
so	9
as	9
at	9
the	9
same	9
time	9
to	9
imitate	9
the	9
valiant	9
Don	9
Roland,	9
when	9
at	9
the	9
fountain	9
he	9
had	9
evidence	9
of	9
the	9
fair	9
Angelica	9
having	9
disgraced	9
herself	9
with	9
Medoro	9
and	9
through	9
grief	9
thereat	9
went	9
mad,	9
and	9
plucked	9
up	9
trees,	9
troubled	9
the	9
waters	9
of	9
the	9
clear	9
springs,	9
slew	9
destroyed	9
flocks,	9
burned	9
down	9
huts,	9
levelled	9
houses,	9
dragged	9
mares	9
after	9
him,	9
and	9
perpetrated	9
a	9
hundred	9
thousand	9
other	9
outrages	9
worthy	9
of	9
everlasting	9
renown	9
and	9
record?	9
And	9
though	9
I	9
have	9
no	9
intention	9
of	9
imitating	9
Roland,	9
or	9
Orlando,	9
or	9
Rotolando	9
(for	9
he	9
went	9
by	9
all	9
these	9
names),	9
step	9
by	9
step	9
in	9
all	9
the	9
mad	9
things	9
he	9
did,	9
said,	9
and	9
thought,	9
I	9
will	9
make	9
a	9
rough	9
copy	9
to	9
the	9
best	9
of	9
my	9
power	9
of	9
all	9
that	9
seems	9
to	9
me	9
most	9
essential;	9
but	9
perhaps	9
I	9
shall	9
content	9
myself	9
with	9
the	9
simple	9
imitation	9
of	9
Amadis,	9
who	9
without	9
giving	9
way	9
to	9
any	9
mischievous	9
madness	9
but	9
merely	9
to	9
tears	9
and	9
sorrow,	9
gained	9
as	9
much	9
fame	9
as	9
the	9
most	9
famous.”	9
“It	9
seems	9
to	9
me,”	9
said	9
Sancho,	9
“that	9
the	9
knights	9
who	9
behaved	9
in	9
this	9
way	9
had	9
provocation	9
and	9
cause	9
for	9
those	9
follies	9
and	9
penances;	9
but	9
what	9
cause	9
has	9
your	9
worship	9
for	9
going	9
mad?	9
What	9
lady	9
has	9
rejected	9
you,	9
or	9
what	9
evidence	9
have	9
you	9
found	9
to	9
prove	9
that	9
the	9
lady	9
Dulcinea	9
del	9
Toboso	9
has	9
been	9
trifling	9
with	9
Moor	9
or	9
Christian?”	9
“There	9
is	9
the	9
point,”	9
replied	9
Don	9
Quixote,	9
“and	9
that	9
is	9
the	9
beauty	9
of	9
this	9
business	9
of	9
mine;	9
no	9
thanks	9
to	9
a	9
knight-errant	9
for	9
going	9
mad	9
when	9
he	9
has	9
cause;	9
the	9
thing	9
is	9
to	9
turn	9
crazy	9
without	9
any	9
provocation,	9
and	9
let	9
my	9
lady	9
know,	9
if	9
I	9
do	9
this	9
in	9
the	9
dry,	9
what	9
I	9
would	9
do	9
in	9
the	9
moist;	9
moreover	9
I	9
have	9
abundant	9
cause	9
in	9
the	9
long	9
separation	9
I	9
have	9
endured	9
from	9
my	9
lady	9
till	9
death,	9
Dulcinea	9
del	9
Toboso;	9
for	9
as	9
thou	9
didst	9
hear	9
that	9
shepherd	9
Ambrosio	9
say	9
the	9
other	9
day,	9
in	9
absence	9
all	9
ills	9
are	9
felt	9
and	9
feared;	9
and	9
so,	9
friend	9
Sancho,	9
waste	9
no	9
time	9
in	9
advising	9
me	9
against	9
so	9
rare,	9
so	9
happy,	9
and	9
so	9
unheard-of	9
an	9
imitation;	9
mad	9
I	9
am,	9
and	9
mad	9
I	9
must	9
be	9
until	9
thou	9
returnest	9
with	9
the	9
answer	9
to	9
a	9
letter	9
that	9
I	9
mean	9
to	9
send	9
by	9
thee	9
to	9
my	9
lady	9
Dulcinea;	9
and	9
if	9
it	9
be	9
such	9
as	9
my	9
constancy	9
deserves,	9
my	9
insanity	9
and	9
penance	9
will	9
come	9
to	9
an	9
end;	9
and	9
if	9
it	9
be	9
to	9
the	9
opposite	9
effect,	9
I	9
shall	9
become	9
mad	9
in	9
earnest,	9
and,	9
being	9
so,	9
I	9
shall	9
suffer	9
no	9
more;	9
thus	9
in	9
whatever	9
way	9
she	9
may	9
answer	9
I	9
shall	9
escape	9
from	9
the	9
struggle	9
and	9
affliction	9
in	9
which	9
thou	9
wilt	9
leave	9
me,	9
enjoying	9
in	9
my	9
senses	9
the	9
boon	9
thou	9
bearest	9
me,	9
or	9
as	9
a	9
madman	9
not	9
feeling	9
the	9
evil	9
thou	9
bringest	9
me.	9
But	9
tell	9
me,	9
Sancho,	9
hast	9
thou	9
got	9
Mambrino’s	9
helmet	9
safe?	9
for	9
I	9
saw	9
thee	9
take	9
it	9
up	9
from	9
the	9
ground	9
when	9
that	9
ungrateful	9
wretch	9
tried	9
to	9
break	9
it	9
in	9
pieces	9
but	9
could	9
not,	9
by	9
which	9
the	9
fineness	9
of	9
its	9
temper	9
may	9
be	9
seen.”	9
To	9
which	9
Sancho	9
made	9
answer,	9
“By	9
the	9
living	9
God,	9
Sir	9
Knight	9
of	9
the	9
Rueful	9
Countenance,	9
I	9
cannot	9
endure	9
or	9
bear	9
with	9
patience	9
some	9
of	9
the	9
things	9
that	9
your	9
worship	9
says;	9
and	9
from	9
them	9
I	9
begin	9
to	9
suspect	9
that	9
all	9
you	9
tell	9
me	9
about	9
chivalry,	9
and	9
winning	9
kingdoms	9
and	9
empires,	9
and	9
giving	9
islands,	9
and	9
bestowing	9
other	9
rewards	9
and	9
dignities	9
after	9
the	9
custom	9
of	9
knights-errant,	9
must	9
be	9
all	9
made	9
up	9
of	9
wind	9
and	9
lies,	9
and	9
all	9
pigments	9
or	9
figments,	9
or	9
whatever	9
we	9
may	9
call	9
them;	9
for	9
what	9
would	9
anyone	9
think	9
that	9
heard	9
your	9
worship	9
calling	9
a	9
barber’s	9
basin	9
Mambrino’s	9
helmet	9
without	9
ever	9
seeing	9
the	9
mistake	9
all	9
this	9
time,	9
but	9
that	9
one	9
who	9
says	9
and	9
maintains	9
such	9
things	9
must	9
have	9
his	9
brains	9
addled?	9
I	9
have	9
the	9
basin	9
in	9
my	9
sack	9
all	9
dinted,	9
and	9
I	9
am	9
taking	9
it	9
home	9
to	9
have	9
it	9
mended,	9
to	9
trim	9
my	9
beard	9
in	9
it,	9
if,	9
by	9
God’s	9
grace,	9
I	9
am	9
allowed	9
to	9
see	9
my	9
wife	9
and	9
children	9
some	9
day	9
or	9
other.”	9
“Look	9
here,	9
Sancho,”	9
said	9
Don	9
Quixote,	9
“by	9
him	9
thou	9
didst	9
swear	9
by	9
just	9
now	9
I	9
swear	9
thou	9
hast	9
the	9
most	9
limited	9
understanding	9
that	9
any	9
squire	9
in	9
the	9
world	9
has	9
or	9
ever	9
had.	9
Is	9
it	9
possible	9
that	9
all	9
this	9
time	9
thou	9
hast	9
been	9
going	9
about	9
with	9
me	9
thou	9
hast	9
never	9
found	9
out	9
that	9
all	9
things	9
belonging	9
to	9
knights-errant	9
seem	9
to	9
be	9
illusions	9
and	9
nonsense	9
and	9
ravings,	9
and	9
to	9
go	9
always	9
by	9
contraries?	9
And	9
not	9
because	9
it	9
really	9
is	9
so,	9
but	9
because	9
there	9
is	9
always	9
a	9
swarm	9
of	9
enchanters	9
in	9
attendance	9
upon	9
us	9
that	9
change	9
and	9
alter	9
everything	9
with	9
us,	9
and	9
turn	9
things	9
as	9
they	9
please,	9
and	9
according	9
as	9
they	9
are	9
disposed	9
to	9
aid	9
or	9
destroy	9
us;	9
thus	9
what	9
seems	9
to	9
thee	9
a	9
barber’s	9
basin	9
seems	9
to	9
me	9
Mambrino’s	9
helmet,	9
and	9
to	9
another	9
it	9
will	9
seem	9
something	9
else;	9
and	9
rare	9
foresight	9
it	9
was	9
in	9
the	9
sage	9
who	9
is	9
on	9
my	9
side	9
to	9
make	9
what	9
is	9
really	9
and	9
truly	9
Mambrino’s	9
helmet	9
seem	9
a	9
basin	9
to	9
everybody,	9
for,	9
being	9
held	9
in	9
such	9
estimation	9
as	9
it	9
is,	9
all	9
the	9
world	9
would	9
pursue	9
me	9
to	9
rob	9
me	9
of	9
it;	9
but	9
when	9
they	9
see	9
it	9
is	9
only	9
a	9
barber’s	9
basin	9
they	9
do	9
not	9
take	9
the	9
trouble	9
to	9
obtain	9
it;	9
as	9
was	9
plainly	9
shown	9
by	9
him	9
who	9
tried	9
to	9
break	9
it,	9
and	9
left	9
it	9
on	9
the	9
ground	9
without	9
taking	9
it,	9
for,	9
by	9
my	9
faith,	9
had	9
he	9
known	9
it	9
he	9
would	9
never	9
have	9
left	9
it	9
behind.	9
Keep	9
it	9
safe,	9
my	9
friend,	9
for	9
just	9
now	9
I	9
have	9
no	9
need	9
of	9
it;	9
indeed,	9
I	9
shall	9
have	9
to	9
take	9
off	9
all	9
this	9
armour	9
and	9
remain	9
as	9
naked	9
as	9
I	9
was	9
born,	9
if	9
I	9
have	9
a	9
mind	9
to	9
follow	9
Roland	9
rather	9
than	9
Amadis	9
in	9
my	9
penance.”	9
Thus	9
talking	9
they	9
reached	9
the	9
foot	9
of	9
a	9
high	9
mountain	9
which	9
stood	9
like	9
an	9
isolated	9
peak	9
among	9
the	9
others	9
that	9
surrounded	9
it.	9
Past	9
its	9
base	9
there	9
flowed	9
a	9
gentle	9
brook,	9
all	9
around	9
it	9
spread	9
a	9
meadow	9
so	9
green	9
and	9
luxuriant	9
that	9
it	9
was	9
a	9
delight	9
to	9
the	9
eyes	9
to	9
look	9
upon	9
it,	9
and	9
forest	9
trees	9
in	9
abundance,	9
and	9
shrubs	9
and	9
flowers,	9
added	9
to	9
the	9
charms	9
of	9
the	9
spot.	9
Upon	9
this	9
place	9
the	9
Knight	9
of	9
the	9
Rueful	9
Countenance	9
fixed	9
his	9
choice	9
for	9
the	9
performance	9
of	9
his	9
penance,	9
and	9
as	9
he	9
beheld	9
it	9
exclaimed	9
in	9
a	9
loud	9
voice	9
as	9
though	9
he	9
were	9
out	9
of	9
his	9
senses:	9
“This	9
is	9
the	9
place,	9
oh,	9
ye	9
heavens,	9
that	9
I	9
select	9
and	9
choose	9
for	9
bewailing	9
the	9
misfortune	9
in	9
which	9
ye	9
yourselves	9
have	9
plunged	9
me:	9
this	9
is	9
the	9
spot	9
where	9
the	9
overflowings	9
of	9
mine	9
eyes	9
shall	9
swell	9
the	9
waters	9
of	9
yon	9
little	9
brook,	9
and	9
my	9
deep	9
and	9
endless	9
sighs	9
shall	9
stir	9
unceasingly	9
the	9
leaves	9
of	9
these	9
mountain	9
trees,	9
in	9
testimony	9
and	9
token	9
of	9
the	9
pain	9
my	9
persecuted	9
heart	9
is	9
suffering.	9
Oh,	9
ye	9
rural	9
deities,	9
whoever	9
ye	9
be	9
that	9
haunt	9
this	9
lone	9
spot,	9
give	9
ear	9
to	9
the	9
complaint	9
of	9
a	9
wretched	9
lover	9
whom	9
long	9
absence	9
and	9
brooding	9
jealousy	9
have	9
driven	9
to	9
bewail	9
his	9
fate	9
among	9
these	9
wilds	9
and	9
complain	9
of	9
the	9
hard	9
heart	9
of	9
that	9
fair	9
and	9
ungrateful	9
one,	9
the	9
end	9
and	9
limit	9
of	9
all	9
human	9
beauty!	9
Oh,	9
ye	9
wood	9
nymphs	9
and	9
dryads,	9
that	9
dwell	9
in	9
the	9
thickets	9
of	9
the	9
forest,	9
so	9
may	9
the	9
nimble	9
wanton	9
satyrs	9
by	9
whom	9
ye	9
are	9
vainly	9
wooed	9
never	9
disturb	9
your	9
sweet	9
repose,	9
help	9
me	9
to	9
lament	9
my	9
hard	9
fate	9
or	9
at	9
least	9
weary	9
not	9
at	9
listening	9
to	9
it!	9
Oh,	9
Dulcinea	9
del	9
Toboso,	9
day	9
of	9
my	9
night,	9
glory	9
of	9
my	9
pain,	9
guide	9
of	9
my	9
path,	9
star	9
of	9
my	9
fortune,	9
so	9
may	9
Heaven	9
grant	9
thee	9
in	9
full	9
all	9
thou	9
seekest	9
of	9
it,	9
bethink	9
thee	9
of	9
the	9
place	9
and	9
condition	9
to	9
which	9
absence	9
from	9
thee	9
has	9
brought	9
me,	9
and	9
make	9
that	9
return	9
in	9
kindness	9
that	9
is	9
due	9
to	9
my	9
fidelity!	9
Oh,	9
lonely	9
trees,	9
that	9
from	9
this	9
day	9
forward	9
shall	9
bear	9
me	9
company	9
in	9
my	9
solitude,	9
give	9
me	9
some	9
sign	9
by	9
the	9
gentle	9
movement	9
of	9
your	9
boughs	9
that	9
my	9
presence	9
is	9
not	9
distasteful	9
to	9
you!	9
Oh,	9
thou,	9
my	9
squire,	9
pleasant	9
companion	9
in	9
my	9
prosperous	9
and	9
adverse	9
fortunes,	9
fix	9
well	9
in	9
thy	9
memory	9
what	9
thou	9
shalt	9
see	9
me	9
do	9
here,	9
so	9
that	9
thou	9
mayest	9
relate	9
and	9
report	9
it	9
to	9
the	9
sole	9
cause	9
of	9
all,”	9
and	9
so	9
saying	9
he	9
dismounted	9
from	9
Rocinante,	9
and	9
in	9
an	9
instant	9
relieved	9
him	9
of	9
saddle	9
and	9
bridle,	9
and	9
giving	9
him	9
a	9
slap	9
on	9
the	9
croup,	9
said,	9
“He	9
gives	9
thee	9
freedom	9
who	9
is	9
bereft	9
of	9
it	9
himself,	9
oh	9
steed	9
as	9
excellent	9
in	9
deed	9
as	9
thou	9
art	9
unfortunate	9
in	9
thy	9
lot;	9
begone	9
where	9
thou	9
wilt,	9
for	9
thou	9
bearest	9
written	9
on	9
thy	9
forehead	9
that	9
neither	9
Astolfo’s	9
hippogriff,	9
nor	9
the	9
famed	9
Frontino	9
that	9
cost	9
Bradamante	9
so	9
dear,	9
could	9
equal	9
thee	9
in	9
speed.”	9
Seeing	9
this	9
Sancho	9
said,	9
“Good	9
luck	9
to	9
him	9
who	9
has	9
saved	9
us	9
the	9
trouble	9
of	9
stripping	9
the	9
pack-saddle	9
off	9
Dapple!	9
By	9
my	9
faith	9
he	9
would	9
not	9
have	9
gone	9
without	9
a	9
slap	9
on	9
the	9
croup	9
and	9
something	9
said	9
in	9
his	9
praise;	9
though	9
if	9
he	9
were	9
here	9
I	9
would	9
not	9
let	9
anyone	9
strip	9
him,	9
for	9
there	9
would	9
be	9
no	9
occasion,	9
as	9
he	9
had	9
nothing	9
of	9
the	9
lover	9
or	9
victim	9
of	9
despair	9
about	9
him,	9
inasmuch	9
as	9
his	9
master,	9
which	9
I	9
was	9
while	9
it	9
was	9
God’s	9
pleasure,	9
was	9
nothing	9
of	9
the	9
sort;	9
and	9
indeed,	9
Sir	9
Knight	9
of	9
the	9
Rueful	9
Countenance,	9
if	9
my	9
departure	9
and	9
your	9
worship’s	9
madness	9
are	9
to	9
come	9
off	9
in	9
earnest,	9
it	9
will	9
be	9
as	9
well	9
to	9
saddle	9
Rocinante	9
again	9
in	9
order	9
that	9
he	9
may	9
supply	9
the	9
want	9
of	9
Dapple,	9
because	9
it	9
will	9
save	9
me	9
time	9
in	9
going	9
and	9
returning:	9
for	9
if	9
I	9
go	9
on	9
foot	9
I	9
don’t	9
know	9
when	9
I	9
shall	9
get	9
there	9
or	9
when	9
I	9
shall	9
get	9
back,	9
as	9
I	9
am,	9
in	9
truth,	9
a	9
bad	9
walker.”	9
“I	9
declare,	9
Sancho,”	9
returned	9
Don	9
Quixote,	9
“it	9
shall	9
be	9
as	9
thou	9
wilt,	9
for	9
thy	9
plan	9
does	9
not	9
seem	9
to	9
me	9
a	9
bad	9
one,	9
and	9
three	9
days	9
hence	9
thou	9
wilt	9
depart,	9
for	9
I	9
wish	9
thee	9
to	9
observe	9
in	9
the	9
meantime	9
what	9
I	9
do	9
and	9
say	9
for	9
her	9
sake,	9
that	9
thou	9
mayest	9
be	9
able	9
to	9
tell	9
it.”	9
“But	9
what	9
more	9
have	9
I	9
to	9
see	9
besides	9
what	9
I	9
have	9
seen?”	9
said	9
Sancho.	9
“Much	9
thou	9
knowest	9
about	9
it!”	9
said	9
Don	9
Quixote.	9
“I	9
have	9
now	9
got	9
to	9
tear	9
up	9
my	9
garments,	9
to	9
scatter	9
about	9
my	9
armour,	9
knock	9
my	9
head	9
against	9
these	9
rocks,	9
and	9
more	9
of	9
the	9
same	9
sort	9
of	9
thing,	9
which	9
thou	9
must	9
witness.”	9
“For	9
the	9
love	9
of	9
God,”	9
said	9
Sancho,	9
“be	9
careful,	9
your	9
worship,	9
how	9
you	9
give	9
yourself	9
those	9
knocks	9
on	9
the	9
head,	9
for	9
you	9
may	9
come	9
across	9
such	9
a	9
rock,	9
and	9
in	9
such	9
a	9
way,	9
that	9
the	9
very	9
first	9
may	9
put	9
an	9
end	9
to	9
the	9
whole	9
contrivance	9
of	9
this	9
penance;	9
and	9
I	9
should	9
think,	9
if	9
indeed	9
knocks	9
on	9
the	9
head	9
seem	9
necessary	9
to	9
you,	9
and	9
this	9
business	9
cannot	9
be	9
done	9
without	9
them,	9
you	9
might	9
be	9
content—as	9
the	9
whole	9
thing	9
is	9
feigned,	9
and	9
counterfeit,	9
and	9
in	9
joke—you	9
might	9
be	9
content,	9
I	9
say,	9
with	9
giving	9
them	9
to	9
yourself	9
in	9
the	9
water,	9
or	9
against	9
something	9
soft,	9
like	9
cotton;	9
and	9
leave	9
it	9
all	9
to	9
me;	9
for	9
I’ll	9
tell	9
my	9
lady	9
that	9
your	9
worship	9
knocked	9
your	9
head	9
against	9
a	9
point	9
of	9
rock	9
harder	9
than	9
a	9
diamond.”	9
“I	9
thank	9
thee	9
for	9
thy	9
good	9
intentions,	9
friend	9
Sancho,”	9
answered	9
Don	9
Quixote,	9
“but	9
I	9
would	9
have	9
thee	9
know	9
that	9
all	9
these	9
things	9
I	9
am	9
doing	9
are	9
not	9
in	9
joke,	9
but	9
very	9
much	9
in	9
earnest,	9
for	9
anything	9
else	9
would	9
be	9
a	9
transgression	9
of	9
the	9
ordinances	9
of	9
chivalry,	9
which	9
forbid	9
us	9
to	9
tell	9
any	9
lie	9
whatever	9
under	9
the	9
penalties	9
due	9
to	9
apostasy;	9
and	9
to	9
do	9
one	9
thing	9
instead	9
of	9
another	9
is	9
just	9
the	9
same	9
as	9
lying;	9
so	9
my	9
knocks	9
on	9
the	9
head	9
must	9
be	9
real,	9
solid,	9
and	9
valid,	9
without	9
anything	9
sophisticated	9
or	9
fanciful	9
about	9
them,	9
and	9
it	9
will	9
be	9
needful	9
to	9
leave	9
me	9
some	9
lint	9
to	9
dress	9
my	9
wounds,	9
since	9
fortune	9
has	9
compelled	9
us	9
to	9
do	9
without	9
the	9
balsam	9
we	9
lost.”	9
“It	9
was	9
worse	9
losing	9
the	9
ass,”	9
replied	9
Sancho,	9
“for	9
with	9
him	9
lint	9
and	9
all	9
were	9
lost;	9
but	9
I	9
beg	9
of	9
your	9
worship	9
not	9
to	9
remind	9
me	9
again	9
of	9
that	9
accursed	9
liquor,	9
for	9
my	9
soul,	9
not	9
to	9
say	9
my	9
stomach,	9
turns	9
at	9
hearing	9
the	9
very	9
name	9
of	9
it;	9
and	9
I	9
beg	9
of	9
you,	9
too,	9
to	9
reckon	9
as	9
past	9
the	9
three	9
days	9
you	9
allowed	9
me	9
for	9
seeing	9
the	9
mad	9
things	9
you	9
do,	9
for	9
I	9
take	9
them	9
as	9
seen	9
already	9
and	9
pronounced	9
upon,	9
and	9
I	9
will	9
tell	9
wonderful	9
stories	9
to	9
my	9
lady;	9
so	9
write	9
the	9
letter	9
and	9
send	9
me	9
off	9
at	9
once,	9
for	9
I	9
long	9
to	9
return	9
and	9
take	9
your	9
worship	9
out	9
of	9
this	9
purgatory	9
where	9
I	9
am	9
leaving	9
you.”	9
“Purgatory	9
dost	9
thou	9
call	9
it,	9
Sancho?”	9
said	9
Don	9
Quixote,	9
“rather	9
call	9
it	9
hell,	9
or	9
even	9
worse	9
if	9
there	9
be	9
anything	9
worse.”	9
“For	9
one	9
who	9
is	9
in	9
hell,”	9
said	9
Sancho,	9
“_nulla	9
est	9
retentio_,	9
as	9
I	9
have	9
heard	9
say.”	9
“I	9
do	9
not	9
understand	9
what	9
_retentio_	9
means,”	9
said	9
Don	9
Quixote.	9
“_Retentio_,”	9
answered	9
Sancho,	9
“means	9
that	9
whoever	9
is	9
in	9
hell	9
never	9
comes	9
nor	9
can	9
come	9
out	9
of	9
it,	9
which	9
will	9
be	9
the	9
opposite	9
case	9
with	9
your	9
worship	9
or	9
my	9
legs	9
will	9
be	9
idle,	9
that	9
is	9
if	9
I	9
have	9
spurs	9
to	9
enliven	9
Rocinante:	9
let	9
me	9
once	9
get	9
to	9
El	9
Toboso	9
and	9
into	9
the	9
presence	9
of	9
my	9
lady	9
Dulcinea,	9
and	9
I	9
will	9
tell	9
her	9
such	9
things	9
of	9
the	9
follies	9
and	9
madnesses	9
(for	9
it	9
is	9
all	9
one)	9
that	9
your	9
worship	9
has	9
done	9
and	9
is	9
still	9
doing,	9
that	9
I	9
will	9
manage	9
to	9
make	9
her	9
softer	9
than	9
a	9
glove	9
though	9
I	9
find	9
her	9
harder	9
than	9
a	9
cork	9
tree;	9
and	9
with	9
her	9
sweet	9
and	9
honeyed	9
answer	9
I	9
will	9
come	9
back	9
through	9
the	9
air	9
like	9
a	9
witch,	9
and	9
take	9
your	9
worship	9
out	9
of	9
this	9
purgatory	9
that	9
seems	9
to	9
be	9
hell	9
but	9
is	9
not,	9
as	9
there	9
is	9
hope	9
of	9
getting	9
out	9
of	9
it;	9
which,	9
as	9
I	9
have	9
said,	9
those	9
in	9
hell	9
have	9
not,	9
and	9
I	9
believe	9
your	9
worship	9
will	9
not	9
say	9
anything	9
to	9
the	9
contrary.”	9
“That	9
is	9
true,”	9
said	9
he	9
of	9
the	9
Rueful	9
Countenance,	9
“but	9
how	9
shall	9
we	9
manage	9
to	9
write	9
the	9
letter?”	9
“And	9
the	9
ass-colt	9
order	9
too,”	9
added	9
Sancho.	9
“All	9
shall	9
be	9
included,”	9
said	9
Don	9
Quixote;	9
“and	9
as	9
there	9
is	9
no	9
paper,	9
it	9
would	9
be	9
well	9
done	9
to	9
write	9
it	9
on	9
the	9
leaves	9
of	9
trees,	9
as	9
the	9
ancients	9
did,	9
or	9
on	9
tablets	9
of	9
wax;	9
though	9
that	9
would	9
be	9
as	9
hard	9
to	9
find	9
just	9
now	9
as	9
paper.	9
But	9
it	9
has	9
just	9
occurred	9
to	9
me	9
how	9
it	9
may	9
be	9
conveniently	9
and	9
even	9
more	9
than	9
conveniently	9
written,	9
and	9
that	9
is	9
in	9
the	9
notebook	9
that	9
belonged	9
to	9
Cardenio,	9
and	9
thou	9
wilt	9
take	9
care	9
to	9
have	9
it	9
copied	9
on	9
paper,	9
in	9
a	9
good	9
hand,	9
at	9
the	9
first	9
village	9
thou	9
comest	9
to	9
where	9
there	9
is	9
a	9
schoolmaster,	9
or	9
if	9
not,	9
any	9
sacristan	9
will	9
copy	9
it;	9
but	9
see	9
thou	9
give	9
it	9
not	9
to	9
any	9
notary	9
to	9
copy,	9
for	9
they	9
write	9
a	9
law	9
hand	9
that	9
Satan	9
could	9
not	9
make	9
out.”	9
“But	9
what	9
is	9
to	9
be	9
done	9
about	9
the	9
signature?”	9
said	9
Sancho.	9
“The	9
letters	9
of	9
Amadis	9
were	9
never	9
signed,”	9
said	9
Don	9
Quixote.	9
“That	9
is	9
all	9
very	9
well,”	9
said	9
Sancho,	9
“but	9
the	9
order	9
must	9
needs	9
be	9
signed,	9
and	9
if	9
it	9
is	9
copied	9
they	9
will	9
say	9
the	9
signature	9
is	9
false,	9
and	9
I	9
shall	9
be	9
left	9
without	9
ass-colts.”	9
“The	9
order	9
shall	9
go	9
signed	9
in	9
the	9
same	9
book,”	9
said	9
Don	9
Quixote,	9
“and	9
on	9
seeing	9
it	9
my	9
niece	9
will	9
make	9
no	9
difficulty	9
about	9
obeying	9
it;	9
as	9
to	9
the	9
loveletter	9
thou	9
canst	9
put	9
by	9
way	9
of	9
signature,	9
‘_Yours	9
till	9
death,	9

Knight	9

Rueful	9
Countenance._’	9
And	9
it	9
will	9
be	9
no	9
great	9
matter	9
if	9
it	9
is	9
in	9
some	9
other	9
person’s	9
hand,	9
for	9
as	9
well	9
as	9
I	9
recollect	9
Dulcinea	9
can	9
neither	9
read	9
nor	9
write,	9
nor	9
in	9
the	9
whole	9
course	9
of	9
her	9
life	9
has	9
she	9
seen	9
handwriting	9
or	9
letter	9
of	9
mine,	9
for	9
my	9
love	9
and	9
hers	9
have	9
been	9
always	9
platonic,	9
not	9
going	9
beyond	9
a	9
modest	9
look,	9
and	9
even	9
that	9
so	9
seldom	9
that	9
I	9
can	9
safely	9
swear	9
I	9
have	9
not	9
seen	9
her	9
four	9
times	9
in	9
all	9
these	9
twelve	9
years	9
I	9
have	9
been	9
loving	9
her	9
more	9
than	9
the	9
light	9
of	9
these	9
eyes	9
that	9
the	9
earth	9
will	9
one	9
day	9
devour;	9
and	9
perhaps	9
even	9
of	9
those	9
four	9
times	9
she	9
has	9
not	9
once	9
perceived	9
that	9
I	9
was	9
looking	9
at	9
her:	9
such	9
is	9
the	9
retirement	9
and	9
seclusion	9
in	9
which	9
her	9
father	9
Lorenzo	9
Corchuelo	9
and	9
her	9
mother	9
Aldonza	9
Nogales	9
have	9
brought	9
her	9
up.”	9
“So,	9
so!”	9
said	9
Sancho;	9
“Lorenzo	9
Corchuelo’s	9
daughter	9
is	9
the	9
lady	9
Dulcinea	9
del	9
Toboso,	9
otherwise	9
called	9
Aldonza	9
Lorenzo?”	9
“She	9
it	9
is,”	9
said	9
Don	9
Quixote,	9
“and	9
she	9
it	9
is	9
that	9
is	9
worthy	9
to	9
be	9
lady	9
of	9
the	9
whole	9
universe.”	9
“I	9
know	9
her	9
well,”	9
said	9
Sancho,	9
“and	9
let	9
me	9
tell	9
you	9
she	9
can	9
fling	9
a	9
crowbar	9
as	9
well	9
as	9
the	9
lustiest	9
lad	9
in	9
all	9
the	9
town.	9
Giver	9
of	9
all	9
good!	9
but	9
she	9
is	9
a	9
brave	9
lass,	9
and	9
a	9
right	9
and	9
stout	9
one,	9
and	9
fit	9
to	9
be	9
helpmate	9
to	9
any	9
knight-errant	9
that	9
is	9
or	9
is	9
to	9
be,	9
who	9
may	9
make	9
her	9
his	9
lady:	9
the	9
whoreson	9
wench,	9
what	9
sting	9
she	9
has	9
and	9
what	9
a	9
voice!	9
I	9
can	9
tell	9
you	9
one	9
day	9
she	9
posted	9
herself	9
on	9
the	9
top	9
of	9
the	9
belfry	9
of	9
the	9
village	9
to	9
call	9
some	9
labourers	9
of	9
theirs	9
that	9
were	9
in	9
a	9
ploughed	9
field	9
of	9
her	9
father’s,	9
and	9
though	9
they	9
were	9
better	9
than	9
half	9
a	9
league	9
off	9
they	9
heard	9
her	9
as	9
well	9
as	9
if	9
they	9
were	9
at	9
the	9
foot	9
of	9
the	9
tower;	9
and	9
the	9
best	9
of	9
her	9
is	9
that	9
she	9
is	9
not	9
a	9
bit	9
prudish,	9
for	9
she	9
has	9
plenty	9
of	9
affability,	9
and	9
jokes	9
with	9
everybody,	9
and	9
has	9
a	9
grin	9
and	9
a	9
jest	9
for	9
everything.	9
So,	9
Sir	9
Knight	9
of	9
the	9
Rueful	9
Countenance,	9
I	9
say	9
you	9
not	9
only	9
may	9
and	9
ought	9
to	9
do	9
mad	9
freaks	9
for	9
her	9
sake,	9
but	9
you	9
have	9
a	9
good	9
right	9
to	9
give	9
way	9
to	9
despair	9
and	9
hang	9
yourself;	9
and	9
no	9
one	9
who	9
knows	9
of	9
it	9
but	9
will	9
say	9
you	9
did	9
well,	9
though	9
the	9
devil	9
should	9
take	9
you;	9
and	9
I	9
wish	9
I	9
were	9
on	9
my	9
road	9
already,	9
simply	9
to	9
see	9
her,	9
for	9
it	9
is	9
many	9
a	9
day	9
since	9
I	9
saw	9
her,	9
and	9
she	9
must	9
be	9
altered	9
by	9
this	9
time,	9
for	9
going	9
about	9
the	9
fields	9
always,	9
and	9
the	9
sun	9
and	9
the	9
air	9
spoil	9
women’s	9
looks	9
greatly.	9
But	9
I	9
must	9
own	9
the	9
truth	9
to	9
your	9
worship,	9
Señor	9
Don	9
Quixote;	9
until	9
now	9
I	9
have	9
been	9
under	9
a	9
great	9
mistake,	9
for	9
I	9
believed	9
truly	9
and	9
honestly	9
that	9
the	9
lady	9
Dulcinea	9
must	9
be	9
some	9
princess	9
your	9
worship	9
was	9
in	9
love	9
with,	9
or	9
some	9
person	9
great	9
enough	9
to	9
deserve	9
the	9
rich	9
presents	9
you	9
have	9
sent	9
her,	9
such	9
as	9
the	9
Biscayan	9
and	9
the	9
galley	9
slaves,	9
and	9
many	9
more	9
no	9
doubt,	9
for	9
your	9
worship	9
must	9
have	9
won	9
many	9
victories	9
in	9
the	9
time	9
when	9
I	9
was	9
not	9
yet	9
your	9
squire.	9
But	9
all	9
things	9
considered,	9
what	9
good	9
can	9
it	9
do	9
the	9
lady	9
Aldonza	9
Lorenzo,	9
I	9
mean	9
the	9
lady	9
Dulcinea	9
del	9
Toboso,	9
to	9
have	9
the	9
vanquished	9
your	9
worship	9
sends	9
or	9
will	9
send	9
coming	9
to	9
her	9
and	9
going	9
down	9
on	9
their	9
knees	9
before	9
her?	9
Because	9
maybe	9
when	9
they	9
came	9
she’d	9
be	9
hackling	9
flax	9
or	9
threshing	9
on	9
the	9
threshing	9
floor,	9
and	9
they’d	9
be	9
ashamed	9
to	9
see	9
her,	9
and	9
she’d	9
laugh,	9
or	9
resent	9
the	9
present.”	9
“I	9
have	9
before	9
now	9
told	9
thee	9
many	9
times,	9
Sancho,”	9
said	9
Don	9
Quixote,	9
“that	9
thou	9
art	9
a	9
mighty	9
great	9
chatterer,	9
and	9
that	9
with	9
a	9
blunt	9
wit	9
thou	9
art	9
always	9
striving	9
at	9
sharpness;	9
but	9
to	9
show	9
thee	9
what	9
a	9
fool	9
thou	9
art	9
and	9
how	9
rational	9
I	9
am,	9
I	9
would	9
have	9
thee	9
listen	9
to	9
a	9
short	9
story.	9
Thou	9
must	9
know	9
that	9
a	9
certain	9
widow,	9
fair,	9
young,	9
independent,	9
and	9
rich,	9
and	9
above	9
all	9
free	9
and	9
easy,	9
fell	9
in	9
love	9
with	9
a	9
sturdy	9
strapping	9
young	9
lay-brother;	9
his	9
superior	9
came	9
to	9
know	9
of	9
it,	9
and	9
one	9
day	9
said	9
to	9
the	9
worthy	9
widow	9
by	9
way	9
of	9
brotherly	9
remonstrance,	9
‘I	9
am	9
surprised,	9
señora,	9
and	9
not	9
without	9
good	9
reason,	9
that	9
a	9
woman	9
of	9
such	9
high	9
standing,	9
so	9
fair,	9
and	9
so	9
rich	9
as	9
you	9
are,	9
should	9
have	9
fallen	9
in	9
love	9
with	9
such	9
a	9
mean,	9
low,	9
stupid	9
fellow	9
as	9
So-and-so,	9
when	9
in	9
this	9
house	9
there	9
are	9
so	9
many	9
masters,	9
graduates,	9
and	9
divinity	9
students	9
from	9
among	9
whom	9
you	9
might	9
choose	9
as	9
if	9
they	9
were	9
a	9
lot	9
of	9
pears,	9
saying,	9
‘This	9
one	9
I’ll	9
take,	9
that	9
I	9
won’t	9
take;’	9
but	9
she	9
replied	9
to	9
him	9
with	9
great	9
sprightliness	9
and	9
candour,	9
‘My	9
dear	9
sir,	9
you	9
are	9
very	9
much	9
mistaken,	9
and	9
your	9
ideas	9
are	9
very	9
old-fashioned,	9
if	9
you	9
think	9
that	9
I	9
have	9
made	9
a	9
bad	9
choice	9
in	9
So-and-so,	9
fool	9
as	9
he	9
seems;	9
because	9
for	9
all	9
I	9
want	9
with	9
him	9
he	9
knows	9
as	9
much	9
and	9
more	9
philosophy	9
than	9
Aristotle.’	9
In	9
the	9
same	9
way,	9
Sancho,	9
for	9
all	9
I	9
want	9
with	9
Dulcinea	9
del	9
Toboso	9
she	9
is	9
just	9
as	9
good	9
as	9
the	9
most	9
exalted	9
princess	9
on	9
earth.	9
It	9
is	9
not	9
to	9
be	9
supposed	9
that	9
all	9
those	9
poets	9
who	9
sang	9
the	9
praises	9
of	9
ladies	9
under	9
the	9
fancy	9
names	9
they	9
give	9
them,	9
had	9
any	9
such	9
mistresses.	9
Thinkest	9
thou	9
that	9
the	9
Amarillises,	9
the	9
Phillises,	9
the	9
Sylvias,	9
the	9
Dianas,	9
the	9
Galateas,	9
the	9
Fílidas,	9
and	9
all	9
the	9
rest	9
of	9
them,	9
that	9
the	9
books,	9
the	9
ballads,	9
the	9
barber’s	9
shops,	9
the	9
theatres	9
are	9
full	9
of,	9
were	9
really	9
and	9
truly	9
ladies	9
of	9
flesh	9
and	9
blood,	9
and	9
mistresses	9
of	9
those	9
that	9
glorify	9
and	9
have	9
glorified	9
them?	9
Nothing	9
of	9
the	9
kind;	9
they	9
only	9
invent	9
them	9
for	9
the	9
most	9
part	9
to	9
furnish	9
a	9
subject	9
for	9
their	9
verses,	9
and	9
that	9
they	9
may	9
pass	9
for	9
lovers,	9
or	9
for	9
men	9
valiant	9
enough	9
to	9
be	9
so;	9
and	9
so	9
it	9
suffices	9
me	9
to	9
think	9
and	9
believe	9
that	9
the	9
good	9
Aldonza	9
Lorenzo	9
is	9
fair	9
and	9
virtuous;	9
and	9
as	9
to	9
her	9
pedigree	9
it	9
is	9
very	9
little	9
matter,	9
for	9
no	9
one	9
will	9
examine	9
into	9
it	9
for	9
the	9
purpose	9
of	9
conferring	9
any	9
order	9
upon	9
her,	9
and	9
I,	9
for	9
my	9
part,	9
reckon	9
her	9
the	9
most	9
exalted	9
princess	9
in	9
the	9
world.	9
For	9
thou	9
shouldst	9
know,	9
Sancho,	9
if	9
thou	9
dost	9
not	9
know,	9
that	9
two	9
things	9
alone	9
beyond	9
all	9
others	9
are	9
incentives	9
to	9
love,	9
and	9
these	9
are	9
great	9
beauty	9
and	9
a	9
good	9
name,	9
and	9
these	9
two	9
things	9
are	9
to	9
be	9
found	9
in	9
Dulcinea	9
in	9
the	9
highest	9
degree,	9
for	9
in	9
beauty	9
no	9
one	9
equals	9
her	9
and	9
in	9
good	9
name	9
few	9
approach	9
her;	9
and	9
to	9
put	9
the	9
whole	9
thing	9
in	9
a	9
nutshell,	9
I	9
persuade	9
myself	9
that	9
all	9
I	9
say	9
is	9
as	9
I	9
say,	9
neither	9
more	9
nor	9
less,	9
and	9
I	9
picture	9
her	9
in	9
my	9
imagination	9
as	9
I	9
would	9
have	9
her	9
to	9
be,	9
as	9
well	9
in	9
beauty	9
as	9
in	9
condition;	9
Helen	9
approaches	9
her	9
not	9
nor	9
does	9
Lucretia	9
come	9
up	9
to	9
her,	9
nor	9
any	9
other	9
of	9
the	9
famous	9
women	9
of	9
times	9
past,	9
Greek,	9
Barbarian,	9
or	9
Latin;	9
and	9
let	9
each	9
say	9
what	9
he	9
will,	9
for	9
if	9
in	9
this	9
I	9
am	9
taken	9
to	9
task	9
by	9
the	9
ignorant,	9
I	9
shall	9
not	9
be	9
censured	9
by	9
the	9
critical.”	9
“I	9
say	9
that	9
your	9
worship	9
is	9
entirely	9
right,”	9
said	9
Sancho,	9
“and	9
that	9
I	9
am	9
an	9
ass.	9
But	9
I	9
know	9
not	9
how	9
the	9
name	9
of	9
ass	9
came	9
into	9
my	9
mouth,	9
for	9
a	9
rope	9
is	9
not	9
to	9
be	9
mentioned	9
in	9
the	9
house	9
of	9
him	9
who	9
has	9
been	9
hanged;	9
but	9
now	9
for	9
the	9
letter,	9
and	9
then,	9
God	9
be	9
with	9
you,	9
I	9
am	9
off.”	9
Don	9
Quixote	9
took	9
out	9
the	9
notebook,	9
and,	9
retiring	9
to	9
one	9
side,	9
very	9
deliberately	9
began	9
to	9
write	9
the	9
letter,	9
and	9
when	9
he	9
had	9
finished	9
it	9
he	9
called	9
to	9
Sancho,	9
saying	9
he	9
wished	9
to	9
read	9
it	9
to	9
him,	9
so	9
that	9
he	9
might	9
commit	9
it	9
to	9
memory,	9
in	9
case	9
of	9
losing	9
it	9
on	9
the	9
road;	9
for	9
with	9
evil	9
fortune	9
like	9
his	9
anything	9
might	9
be	9
apprehended.	9
To	9
which	9
Sancho	9
replied,	9
“Write	9
it	9
two	9
or	9
three	9
times	9
there	9
in	9
the	9
book	9
and	9
give	9
it	9
to	9
me,	9
and	9
I	9
will	9
carry	9
it	9
very	9
carefully,	9
because	9
to	9
expect	9
me	9
to	9
keep	9
it	9
in	9
my	9
memory	9
is	9
all	9
nonsense,	9
for	9
I	9
have	9
such	9
a	9
bad	9
one	9
that	9
I	9
often	9
forget	9
my	9
own	9
name;	9
but	9
for	9
all	9
that	9
repeat	9
it	9
to	9
me,	9
as	9
I	9
shall	9
like	9
to	9
hear	9
it,	9
for	9
surely	9
it	9
will	9
run	9
as	9
if	9
it	9
was	9
in	9
print.”	9
“Listen,”	9
said	9
Don	9
Quixote,	9
“this	9
is	9
what	9
it	9
says:	9

it!	9
And	9
how	9
well	9
you	9
fit	9
in	9
‘The	9
Knight	9
of	9
the	9
Rueful	9
Countenance’	9
into	9
the	9
signature.	9
I	9
declare	9
your	9
worship	9
is	9
indeed	9
the	9
very	9
devil,	9
and	9
there	9
is	9
nothing	9
you	9
don’t	9
know.”	9
“Everything	9
is	9
needed	9
for	9
the	9
calling	9
I	9
follow,”	9
said	9
Don	9
Quixote.	9
“Now	9
then,”	9
said	9
Sancho,	9
“let	9
your	9
worship	9
put	9
the	9
order	9
for	9
the	9
three	9
ass-colts	9
on	9
the	9
other	9
side,	9
and	9
sign	9
it	9
very	9
plainly,	9
that	9
they	9
may	9
recognise	9
it	9
at	9
first	9
sight.”	9
“With	9
all	9
my	9
heart,”	9
said	9
Don	9
Quixote,	9
and	9
as	9
he	9
had	9
written	9
it	9
he	9
read	9
it	9
to	9
this	9
effect:	9
“Mistress	9
Niece,—By	9
this	9
first	9
of	9
ass-colts	9
please	9
pay	9
to	9
Sancho	9
Panza,	9
my	9
squire,	9
three	9
of	9
the	9
five	9
I	9
left	9
at	9
home	9
in	9
your	9
charge:	9
said	9
three	9
ass-colts	9
to	9
be	9
paid	9
and	9
delivered	9
for	9
the	9
same	9
number	9
received	9
here	9
in	9
hand,	9
which	9
upon	9
this	9
and	9
upon	9
his	9
receipt	9
shall	9
be	9
duly	9
paid.	9
Done	9
in	9
the	9
heart	9
of	9
the	9
Sierra	9
Morena,	9
the	9
twenty-seventh	9
of	9
August	9
of	9
this	9
present	9
year.”	9
“That	9
will	9
do,”	9
said	9
Sancho;	9
“now	9
let	9
your	9
worship	9
sign	9
it.”	9
“There	9
is	9
no	9
need	9
to	9
sign	9
it,”	9
said	9
Don	9
Quixote,	9
“but	9
merely	9
to	9
put	9
my	9
flourish,	9
which	9
is	9
the	9
same	9
as	9
a	9
signature,	9
and	9
enough	9
for	9
three	9
asses,	9
or	9
even	9
three	9
hundred.”	9
“I	9
can	9
trust	9
your	9
worship,”	9
returned	9
Sancho;	9
“let	9
me	9
go	9
and	9
saddle	9
Rocinante,	9
and	9
be	9
ready	9
to	9
give	9
me	9
your	9
blessing,	9
for	9
I	9
mean	9
to	9
go	9
at	9
once	9
without	9
seeing	9
the	9
fooleries	9
your	9
worship	9
is	9
going	9
to	9
do;	9
I’ll	9
say	9
I	9
saw	9
you	9
do	9
so	9
many	9
that	9
she	9
will	9
not	9
want	9
any	9
more.”	9
“At	9
any	9
rate,	9
Sancho,”	9
said	9
Don	9
Quixote,	9
“I	9
should	9
like—and	9
there	9
is	9
reason	9
for	9
it—I	9
should	9
like	9
thee,	9
I	9
say,	9
to	9
see	9
me	9
stripped	9
to	9
the	9
skin	9
and	9
performing	9
a	9
dozen	9
or	9
two	9
of	9
insanities,	9
which	9
I	9
can	9
get	9
done	9
in	9
less	9
than	9
half	9
an	9
hour;	9
for	9
having	9
seen	9
them	9
with	9
thine	9
own	9
eyes,	9
thou	9
canst	9
then	9
safely	9
swear	9
to	9
the	9
rest	9
that	9
thou	9
wouldst	9
add;	9
and	9
I	9
promise	9
thee	9
thou	9
wilt	9
not	9
tell	9
of	9
as	9
many	9
as	9
I	9
mean	9
to	9
perform.”	9
“For	9
the	9
love	9
of	9
God,	9
master	9
mine,”	9
said	9
Sancho,	9
“let	9
me	9
not	9
see	9
your	9
worship	9
stripped,	9
for	9
it	9
will	9
sorely	9
grieve	9
me,	9
and	9
I	9
shall	9
not	9
be	9
able	9
to	9
keep	9
from	9
tears,	9
and	9
my	9
head	9
aches	9
so	9
with	9
all	9
I	9
shed	9
last	9
night	9
for	9
Dapple,	9
that	9
I	9
am	9
not	9
fit	9
to	9
begin	9
any	9
fresh	9
weeping;	9
but	9
if	9
it	9
is	9
your	9
worship’s	9
pleasure	9
that	9
I	9
should	9
see	9
some	9
insanities,	9
do	9
them	9
in	9
your	9
clothes,	9
short	9
ones,	9
and	9
such	9
as	9
come	9
readiest	9
to	9
hand;	9
for	9
I	9
myself	9
want	9
nothing	9
of	9
the	9
sort,	9
and,	9
as	9
I	9
have	9
said,	9
it	9
will	9
be	9
a	9
saving	9
of	9
time	9
for	9
my	9
return,	9
which	9
will	9
be	9
with	9
the	9
news	9
your	9
worship	9
desires	9
and	9
deserves.	9
If	9
not,	9
let	9
the	9
lady	9
Dulcinea	9
look	9
to	9
it;	9
if	9
she	9
does	9
not	9
answer	9
reasonably,	9
I	9
swear	9
as	9
solemnly	9
as	9
I	9
can	9
that	9
I	9
will	9
fetch	9
a	9
fair	9
answer	9
out	9
of	9
her	9
stomach	9
with	9
kicks	9
and	9
cuffs;	9
for	9
why	9
should	9
it	9
be	9
borne	9
that	9
a	9
knight-errant	9
as	9
famous	9
as	9
your	9
worship	9
should	9
go	9
mad	9
without	9
rhyme	9
or	9
reason	9
for	9
a—?	9
Her	9
ladyship	9
had	9
best	9
not	9
drive	9
me	9
to	9
say	9
it,	9
for	9
by	9
God	9
I	9
will	9
speak	9
out	9
and	9
let	9
off	9
everything	9
cheap,	9
even	9
if	9
it	9
doesn’t	9
sell:	9
I	9
am	9
pretty	9
good	9
at	9
that!	9
she	9
little	9
knows	9
me;	9
faith,	9
if	9
she	9
knew	9
me	9
she’d	9
be	9
in	9
awe	9
of	9
me.”	9
“In	9
faith,	9
Sancho,”	9
said	9
Don	9
Quixote,	9
“to	9
all	9
appearance	9
thou	9
art	9
no	9
sounder	9
in	9
thy	9
wits	9
than	9
I.”	9
“I	9
am	9
not	9
so	9
mad,”	9
answered	9
Sancho,	9
“but	9
I	9
am	9
more	9
peppery;	9
but	9
apart	9
from	9
all	9
this,	9
what	9
has	9
your	9
worship	9
to	9
eat	9
until	9
I	9
come	9
back?	9
Will	9
you	9
sally	9
out	9
on	9
the	9
road	9
like	9
Cardenio	9
to	9
force	9
it	9
from	9
the	9
shepherds?”	9
“Let	9
not	9
that	9
anxiety	9
trouble	9
thee,”	9
replied	9
Don	9
Quixote,	9
“for	9
even	9
if	9
I	9
had	9
it	9
I	9
should	9
not	9
eat	9
anything	9
but	9
the	9
herbs	9
and	9
the	9
fruits	9
which	9
this	9
meadow	9
and	9
these	9
trees	9
may	9
yield	9
me;	9
the	9
beauty	9
of	9
this	9
business	9
of	9
mine	9
lies	9
in	9
not	9
eating,	9
and	9
in	9
performing	9
other	9
mortifications.”	9
“Do	9
you	9
know	9
what	9
I	9
am	9
afraid	9
of?”	9
said	9
Sancho	9
upon	9
this;	9
“that	9
I	9
shall	9
not	9
be	9
able	9
to	9
find	9
my	9
way	9
back	9
to	9
this	9
spot	9
where	9
I	9
am	9
leaving	9
you,	9
it	9
is	9
such	9
an	9
out-of-the-way	9
place.”	9
“Observe	9
the	9
landmarks	9
well,”	9
said	9
Don	9
Quixote,	9
“for	9
I	9
will	9
try	9
not	9
to	9
go	9
far	9
from	9
this	9
neighbourhood,	9
and	9
I	9
will	9
even	9
take	9
care	9
to	9
mount	9
the	9
highest	9
of	9
these	9
rocks	9
to	9
see	9
if	9
I	9
can	9
discover	9
thee	9
returning;	9
however,	9
not	9
to	9
miss	9
me	9
and	9
lose	9
thyself,	9
the	9
best	9
plan	9
will	9
be	9
to	9
cut	9
some	9
branches	9
of	9
the	9
broom	9
that	9
is	9
so	9
abundant	9
about	9
here,	9
and	9
as	9
thou	9
goest	9
to	9
lay	9
them	9
at	9
intervals	9
until	9
thou	9
hast	9
come	9
out	9
upon	9
the	9
plain;	9
these	9
will	9
serve	9
thee,	9
after	9
the	9
fashion	9
of	9
the	9
clue	9
in	9
the	9
labyrinth	9
of	9
Theseus,	9
as	9
marks	9
and	9
signs	9
for	9
finding	9
me	9
on	9
thy	9
return.”	9
“So	9
I	9
will,”	9
said	9
Sancho	9
Panza,	9
and	9
having	9
cut	9
some,	9
he	9
asked	9
his	9
master’s	9
blessing,	9
and	9
not	9
without	9
many	9
tears	9
on	9
both	9
sides,	9
took	9
his	9
leave	9
of	9
him,	9
and	9
mounting	9
Rocinante,	9
of	9
whom	9
Don	9
Quixote	9
charged	9
him	9
earnestly	9
to	9
have	9
as	9
much	9
care	9
as	9
of	9
his	9
own	9
person,	9
he	9
set	9
out	9
for	9
the	9
plain,	9
strewing	9
at	9
intervals	9
the	9
branches	9
of	9
broom	9
as	9
his	9
master	9
had	9
recommended	9
him;	9
and	9
so	9
he	9
went	9
his	9
way,	9
though	9
Don	9
Quixote	9
still	9
entreated	9
him	9
to	9
see	9
him	9
do	9
were	9
it	9
only	9
a	9
couple	9
of	9
mad	9
acts.	9
He	9
had	9
not	9
gone	9
a	9
hundred	9
paces,	9
however,	9
when	9
he	9
returned	9
and	9
said:	9
“I	9
must	9
say,	9
señor,	9
your	9
worship	9
said	9
quite	9
right,	9
that	9
in	9
order	9
to	9
be	9
able	9
to	9
swear	9
without	9
a	9
weight	9
on	9
my	9
conscience	9
that	9
I	9
had	9
seen	9
you	9
do	9
mad	9
things,	9
it	9
would	9
be	9
well	9
for	9
me	9
to	9
see	9
if	9
it	9
were	9
only	9
one;	9
though	9
in	9
your	9
worship’s	9
remaining	9
here	9
I	9
have	9
seen	9
a	9
very	9
great	9
one.”	9

“Did	9
I	9
not	9
tell	9
thee	9
so?”	9
said	9
Don	9

“Wait,	9
Sancho,	9

I	9

them	9
in	9

and	9
pulling	9
off	9
his	9
breeches	9
in	9
all	9
haste	9
he	9
stripped	9
himself	9
to	9
his	9
skin	9
and	9
his	9
shirt,	9
and	9
then,	9
without	9
more	9
ado,	9
he	9
cut	9
a	9
couple	9
of	9
gambados	9
in	9
the	9
air,	9
and	9
a	9
couple	9
of	9
somersaults,	9
heels	9
over	9

making	9
such	9
a	9
display	9
that,	9
not	9
to	9
see	9
it	9
a	9
second	9

Sancho	9
wheeled	9

round,	9
and	9
felt	9
easy,	9

satisfied	9
in	9
his	9
mind	9
that	9
he	9
could	9
swear	9
he	9
had	9
left	9
his	9
master	9
mad;	9
and	9
so	9
we	9
will	9
leave	9
him	9
to	9
follow	9
his	9
road	9
until	9

was	9
a	9

of	9
the	9

when	9
he	9
found	9
himself	9
alone,	9
the	9
history	9
says	9
that	9
when	9
Don	9
Quixote	9
had	9
completed	9
the	9
performance	9
of	9
the	9
somersaults	9
or	9
capers,	9
naked	9
from	9
the	9
waist	9
down	9
and	9
clothed	9
from	9

that	9
Sancho	9
had	9
gone	9
off	9
without	9
waiting	9
to	9
see	9
any	9
more	9
crazy	9
feats,	9
he	9
climbed	9
up	9
to	9
the	9
top	9
of	9
a	9
high	9
rock,	9
and	9
there	9
set	9
himself	9
to	9

before	9
considered	9
without	9
ever	9
coming	9
to	9
any	9

on	9
the	9
point,	9
namely	9
whether	9
it	9
would	9
be	9
better	9
and	9
more	9
to	9
his	9
purpose	9
to	9
imitate	9
the	9
outrageous	9
madness	9
of	9
Roland,	9
or	9
the	9
melancholy	9
madness	9
of	9
Amadis;	9
and	9
communing	9
with	9
himself	9
he	9
said:	9
“What	9
wonder	9
is	9
it	9
if	9
Roland	9
was	9
so	9
good	9
a	9
knight	9
and	9
so	9
valiant	9
as	9
everyone	9
says	9
he	9
was,	9
when,	9
after	9
all,	9
he	9
was	9
enchanted,	9
and	9
nobody	9
could	9
kill	9
him	9
save	9
by	9
thrusting	9
a	9
corking	9
pin	9
into	9
the	9
sole	9
of	9
his	9
foot,	9
and	9
he	9
always	9
wore	9
shoes	9
with	9
seven	9
iron	9
soles?	9
Though	9
cunning	9
devices	9
did	9
not	9
avail	9
him	9
against	9
Bernardo	9
del	9
Carpio,	9
who	9
knew	9
all	9
about	9
them,	9
and	9
strangled	9
him	9
in	9
his	9
arms	9
at	9
Roncesvalles.	9
But	9
putting	9
the	9
question	9
of	9
his	9
valour	9
aside,	9
let	9
us	9
come	9
to	9
his	9
losing	9
his	9
wits,	9
for	9
certain	9
it	9
is	9
that	9
he	9
did	9
lose	9
them	9
in	9
consequence	9
of	9
the	9
proofs	9
he	9
discovered	9
at	9
the	9
fountain,	9
and	9
the	9
intelligence	9
the	9
shepherd	9
gave	9
him	9
of	9
Angelica	9
having	9
slept	9
more	9
than	9
two	9
siestas	9
with	9
Medoro,	9
a	9
little	9
curly-headed	9
Moor,	9
and	9
page	9
to	9
Agramante.	9
If	9
he	9
was	9
persuaded	9
that	9
this	9
was	9
true,	9
and	9
that	9
his	9
lady	9
had	9
wronged	9
him,	9
it	9
is	9
no	9
wonder	9
that	9
he	9
should	9
have	9
gone	9
mad;	9
but	9
I,	9
how	9
am	9
I	9
to	9
imitate	9
him	9
in	9
his	9
madness,	9
unless	9
I	9
can	9
imitate	9
him	9
in	9
the	9
cause	9
of	9
it?	9
For	9
my	9
Dulcinea,	9
I	9
will	9
venture	9
to	9
swear,	9
never	9
saw	9
a	9
Moor	9
in	9
her	9
life,	9
as	9
he	9
is,	9
in	9
his	9
proper	9
costume,	9
and	9
she	9
is	9
this	9
day	9
as	9
the	9
mother	9
that	9
bore	9
her,	9
and	9
I	9
should	9
plainly	9
be	9
doing	9
her	9
a	9
wrong	9
if,	9
fancying	9
anything	9
else,	9
I	9
were	9
to	9
go	9
mad	9
with	9
the	9
same	9
kind	9
of	9
madness	9
as	9
Roland	9
the	9
Furious.	9
On	9
the	9
other	9
hand,	9
I	9
see	9
that	9
Amadis	9
of	9
Gaul,	9
without	9
losing	9
his	9
senses	9
and	9
without	9
doing	9
anything	9
mad,	9
acquired	9
as	9
a	9
lover	9
as	9
much	9
fame	9
as	9
the	9
most	9
famous;	9
for,	9
according	9
to	9
his	9
history,	9
on	9
finding	9
himself	9
rejected	9
by	9
his	9
lady	9
Oriana,	9
who	9
had	9
ordered	9
him	9
not	9
to	9
appear	9
in	9
her	9
presence	9
until	9
it	9
should	9
be	9
her	9
pleasure,	9
all	9
he	9
did	9
was	9
to	9
retire	9
to	9
the	9
Peña	9
Pobre	9
in	9
company	9
with	9
a	9
hermit,	9
and	9
there	9
he	9
took	9
his	9
fill	9
of	9
weeping	9
until	9
Heaven	9
sent	9
him	9
relief	9
in	9
the	9
midst	9
of	9
his	9
great	9
grief	9
and	9
need.	9
And	9
if	9
this	9
be	9
true,	9
as	9
it	9
is,	9
why	9
should	9
I	9
now	9
take	9
the	9
trouble	9
to	9
strip	9
stark	9
naked,	9
or	9
do	9
mischief	9
to	9
these	9
trees	9
which	9
have	9
done	9
me	9
no	9
harm,	9
or	9
why	9
am	9
I	9
to	9
disturb	9
the	9
clear	9
waters	9
of	9
these	9
brooks	9
which	9
will	9
give	9
me	9
to	9
drink	9
whenever	9
I	9
have	9
a	9
mind?	9
Long	9
live	9
the	9
memory	9
of	9
Amadis	9
and	9
let	9
him	9
be	9
imitated	9
so	9
far	9
as	9
is	9
possible	9
by	9
Don	9
Quixote	9
of	9
La	9
Mancha,	9
of	9
whom	9
it	9
will	9
be	9
said,	9
as	9
was	9
said	9
of	9
the	9
other,	9
that	9
if	9
he	9
did	9
not	9
achieve	9
great	9
things,	9
he	9
died	9
in	9
attempting	9
them;	9
and	9
if	9
I	9
am	9
not	9
repulsed	9
or	9
rejected	9
by	9
my	9
Dulcinea,	9
it	9
is	9
enough	9
for	9
me,	9
as	9
I	9
have	9
said,	9
to	9
be	9
absent	9
from	9
her.	9
And	9
so,	9
now	9
to	9
business;	9
come	9
to	9
my	9
memory	9
ye	9
deeds	9
of	9
Amadis,	9
and	9
show	9
me	9
how	9
I	9
am	9
to	9
begin	9
to	9
imitate	9
you.	9
I	9
know	9
already	9
that	9
what	9
he	9
chiefly	9
did	9
was	9
to	9
pray	9
and	9
commend	9
himself	9
to	9
God;	9
but	9
what	9
am	9
I	9
to	9
do	9
for	9
a	9
rosary,	9
for	9
I	9
have	9
not	9
got	9
one?”	9
And	9
then	9
it	9
occurred	9
to	9
him	9
how	9
he	9
might	9
make	9
one,	9
and	9
that	9
was	9
by	9
tearing	9
a	9
great	9
strip	9
off	9
the	9
tail	9
of	9
his	9
shirt	9
which	9
hung	9
down,	9
and	9
making	9
eleven	9
knots	9
on	9
it,	9
one	9
bigger	9
than	9
the	9
rest,	9
and	9
this	9
served	9
him	9
for	9
a	9
rosary	9
all	9
the	9
time	9
he	9
was	9
there,	9
during	9
which	9
he	9
repeated	9
countless	9
ave-marias.	9
But	9
what	9
distressed	9
him	9
greatly	9
was	9
not	9
having	9
another	9
hermit	9
there	9
to	9
confess	9
him	9
and	9
receive	9
consolation	9
from;	9
and	9
so	9
he	9
solaced	9
himself	9
with	9
pacing	9
up	9
and	9
down	9
the	9
little	9
meadow,	9
and	9
writing	9
and	9
carving	9
on	9
the	9
bark	9
of	9
the	9
trees	9
and	9
on	9
the	9
fine	9
sand	9
a	9
multitude	9
of	9
verses	9
all	9
in	9
harmony	9
with	9
his	9
sadness,	9
and	9
some	9
in	9
praise	9
of	9
Dulcinea;	9
but,	9
when	9
he	9
was	9
found	9
there	9
afterwards,	9
the	9
only	9
ones	9
completely	9
legible	9
that	9
could	9
be	9
discovered	9
were	9
those	9
that	9
follow	9
here:	9
Ye	9
on	9
the	9
mountainside	9
that	9
grow,	9
Ye	9
green	9
things	9
all,	9
trees,	9
shrubs,	9
and	9
bushes,	9
Are	9
ye	9
aweary	9
of	9
the	9
woe	9
That	9
this	9
poor	9
aching	9
bosom	9
crushes?	9
If	9
it	9
disturb	9
you,	9
and	9
I	9
owe	9
Some	9
reparation,	9
it	9
may	9
be	9
a	9
Defence	9
for	9
me	9
to	9
let	9
you	9
know	9
Don	9
Quixote’s	9
tears	9
are	9
on	9
the	9
flow,	9
And	9
all	9
for	9
distant	9
Dulcinea	9
Del	9
Toboso.	9
The	9
lealest	9
lover	9
time	9
can	9
show,	9
Doomed	9
for	9
a	9
lady-love	9
to	9
languish,	9
Among	9
these	9
solitudes	9
doth	9
go,	9
A	9
prey	9
to	9
every	9
kind	9
of	9
anguish.	9
Why	9
Love	9
should	9
like	9
a	9
spiteful	9
foe	9
Thus	9
use	9
him,	9
he	9
hath	9
no	9
idea,	9
But	9
hogsheads	9
full—this	9
doth	9
he	9
know—	9
Don	9
Quixote’s	9
tears	9
are	9
on	9
the	9
flow,	9
And	9
all	9
for	9
distant	9
Dulcinea	9
Del	9
Toboso.	9
Adventure-seeking	9
doth	9
he	9
go	9
Up	9
rugged	9
heights,	9
down	9
rocky	9
valleys,	9
But	9
hill	9
or	9
dale,	9
or	9
high	9
or	9
low,	9
Mishap	9
attendeth	9
all	9
his	9
sallies:	9
Love	9
still	9
pursues	9
him	9
to	9
and	9
fro,	9
And	9
plies	9
his	9
cruel	9
scourge—ah	9
me!	9
a	9
Relentless	9
fate,	9
an	9
endless	9
woe;	9
Don	9
Quixote’s	9
tears	9
are	9
on	9
the	9
flow,	9
And	9
all	9
for	9
distant	9
Dulcinea	9
Del	9
Toboso.	9
The	9
addition	9
of	9
“Del	9
Toboso”	9
to	9
Dulcinea’s	9
name	9
gave	9
rise	9
to	9
no	9
little	9
laughter	9
among	9
those	9
who	9
found	9
the	9
above	9
lines,	9
for	9
they	9
suspected	9
Don	9
Quixote	9
must	9
have	9
fancied	9
that	9
unless	9
he	9
added	9
“del	9
Toboso”	9
when	9
he	9
introduced	9
the	9
name	9
of	9
Dulcinea	9
the	9
verse	9
would	9
be	9
unintelligible;	9
which	9
was	9
indeed	9
the	9
fact,	9
as	9
he	9
himself	9
afterwards	9
admitted.	9
He	9
wrote	9
many	9
more,	9
but,	9
as	9
has	9
been	9
said,	9
these	9
three	9
verses	9
were	9
all	9
that	9
could	9
be	9
plainly	9
and	9
perfectly	9
deciphered.	9
In	9
this	9
way,	9
and	9
in	9
sighing	9
and	9
calling	9
on	9
the	9
fauns	9
and	9
satyrs	9
of	9
the	9
woods	9
and	9
the	9
nymphs	9
of	9
the	9
streams,	9
and	9
Echo,	9
moist	9
and	9
mournful,	9
to	9
answer,	9
console,	9
and	9
hear	9
him,	9
as	9
well	9
as	9
in	9
looking	9
for	9
herbs	9
to	9
sustain	9
him,	9
he	9
passed	9
his	9
time	9
until	9
Sancho’s	9
return;	9
and	9
had	9
that	9
been	9
delayed	9
three	9
weeks,	9
as	9
it	9
was	9
three	9
days,	9
the	9
Knight	9
of	9
the	9
Rueful	9
Countenance	9
would	9
have	9
worn	9
such	9
an	9
altered	9
countenance	9
that	9
the	9
mother	9
that	9
bore	9
him	9
would	9
not	9
have	9
known	9
him:	9
and	9
here	9
it	9
will	9
be	9
well	9
to	9
leave	9
him,	9
wrapped	9
up	9
in	9
sighs	9
and	9
verses,	9
to	9
relate	9
how	9
Sancho	9
Panza	9
fared	9
on	9
his	9
mission.	9
As	9
for	9
him,	9
coming	9
out	9
upon	9
the	9
high	9
road,	9
he	9
made	9
for	9
El	9
Toboso,	9
and	9
the	9
next	9
day	9
reached	9
the	9
inn	9
where	9
the	9
mishap	9
of	9
the	9
blanket	9
had	9
befallen	9
him.	9
As	9
soon	9
as	9
he	9
recognised	9
it	9
he	9
felt	9
as	9
if	9
he	9
were	9
once	9
more	9
living	9
through	9
the	9
air,	9
and	9
he	9
could	9
not	9
bring	9
himself	9
to	9
enter	9
it	9
though	9
it	9
was	9
an	9
hour	9
when	9
he	9
might	9
well	9
have	9
done	9
so,	9
for	9
it	9
was	9
dinner-time,	9
and	9
he	9
longed	9
to	9
taste	9
something	9
hot	9
as	9
it	9
had	9
been	9
all	9
cold	9
fare	9
with	9
him	9
for	9
many	9
days	9
past.	9
This	9
craving	9
drove	9
him	9
to	9
draw	9
near	9
to	9
the	9
inn,	9
still	9
undecided	9
whether	9
to	9
go	9
in	9
or	9
not,	9
and	9
as	9
he	9
was	9
hesitating	9
there	9
came	9
out	9
two	9
persons	9
who	9
at	9
once	9
recognised	9
him,	9
and	9
said	9
one	9
to	9
the	9
other:	9
“Señor	9
licentiate,	9
is	9
not	9
he	9
on	9
the	9
horse	9
there	9
Sancho	9
Panza	9
who,	9
our	9
adventurer’s	9
housekeeper	9
told	9
us,	9
went	9
off	9
with	9
her	9
master	9
as	9
esquire?”	9
“So	9
it	9
is,”	9
said	9
the	9
licentiate,	9
“and	9
that	9
is	9
our	9
friend	9
Don	9
Quixote’s	9
horse;”	9
and	9
if	9
they	9
knew	9
him	9
so	9
well	9
it	9
was	9
because	9
they	9
were	9
the	9
curate	9
and	9
the	9
barber	9
of	9
his	9
own	9
village,	9
the	9
same	9
who	9
had	9
carried	9
out	9
the	9
scrutiny	9
and	9
sentence	9
upon	9
the	9
books;	9
and	9
as	9
soon	9
as	9
they	9
recognised	9
Sancho	9
Panza	9
and	9
Rocinante,	9
being	9
anxious	9
to	9
hear	9
of	9
Don	9
Quixote,	9
they	9
approached,	9
and	9
calling	9
him	9
by	9
his	9
name	9
the	9
curate	9
said,	9
“Friend	9
Sancho	9
Panza,	9
where	9
is	9
your	9
master?”	9
Sancho	9
recognised	9
them	9
at	9
once,	9
and	9
determined	9
to	9
keep	9
secret	9
the	9
place	9
and	9
circumstances	9
where	9
and	9
under	9
which	9
he	9
had	9
left	9
his	9
master,	9
so	9
he	9
replied	9
that	9
his	9
master	9
was	9
engaged	9
in	9
a	9
certain	9
quarter	9
on	9
a	9
certain	9
matter	9
of	9
great	9
importance	9
to	9
him	9
which	9
he	9
could	9
not	9
disclose	9
for	9
the	9
eyes	9
in	9
his	9
head.	9
“Nay,	9
nay,”	9
said	9
the	9
barber,	9
“if	9
you	9
don’t	9
tell	9
us	9
where	9
he	9
is,	9
Sancho	9
Panza,	9
we	9
will	9
suspect	9
as	9
we	9
suspect	9
already,	9
that	9
you	9
have	9
murdered	9
and	9
robbed	9
him,	9
for	9
here	9
you	9
are	9
mounted	9
on	9
his	9
horse;	9
in	9
fact,	9
you	9
must	9
produce	9
the	9
master	9
of	9
the	9
hack,	9
or	9
else	9
take	9
the	9
consequences.”	9
“There	9
is	9
no	9
need	9
of	9
threats	9
with	9
me,”	9
said	9
Sancho,	9
“for	9
I	9
am	9
not	9
a	9
man	9
to	9
rob	9
or	9
murder	9
anybody;	9
let	9
his	9
own	9
fate,	9
or	9
God	9
who	9
made	9
him,	9
kill	9
each	9
one;	9
my	9
master	9
is	9
engaged	9
very	9
much	9
to	9
his	9
taste	9
doing	9
penance	9
in	9
the	9
midst	9
of	9
these	9
mountains;”	9
and	9
then,	9
offhand	9
and	9
without	9
stopping,	9
he	9
told	9
them	9
how	9
he	9
had	9
left	9
him,	9
what	9
adventures	9
had	9
befallen	9
him,	9
and	9
how	9
he	9
was	9
carrying	9
a	9
letter	9
to	9
the	9
lady	9
Dulcinea	9
del	9
Toboso,	9
the	9
daughter	9
of	9
Lorenzo	9
Corchuelo,	9
with	9
whom	9
he	9
was	9
over	9
head	9
and	9
ears	9
in	9
love.	9
They	9
were	9
both	9
amazed	9
at	9
what	9
Sancho	9
Panza	9
told	9
them;	9
for	9
though	9
they	9
were	9
aware	9
of	9
Don	9
Quixote’s	9
madness	9
and	9
the	9
nature	9
of	9
it,	9
each	9
time	9
they	9
heard	9
of	9
it	9
they	9
were	9
filled	9
with	9
fresh	9
wonder.	9
They	9
then	9
asked	9
Sancho	9
Panza	9
to	9
show	9
them	9
the	9
letter	9
he	9
was	9
carrying	9
to	9
the	9
lady	9
Dulcinea	9
del	9
Toboso.	9
He	9
said	9
it	9
was	9
written	9
in	9
a	9
notebook,	9
and	9
that	9
his	9
master’s	9
directions	9
were	9
that	9
he	9
should	9
have	9
it	9
copied	9
on	9
paper	9
at	9
the	9
first	9
village	9
he	9
came	9
to.	9
On	9
this	9
the	9
curate	9
said	9
if	9
he	9
showed	9
it	9
to	9
him,	9
he	9
himself	9
would	9
make	9
a	9
fair	9
copy	9
of	9
it.	9
Sancho	9
put	9
his	9
hand	9
into	9
his	9
bosom	9
in	9
search	9
of	9
the	9
notebook	9
but	9
could	9
not	9
find	9
it,	9
nor,	9
if	9
he	9
had	9
been	9
searching	9
until	9
now,	9
could	9
he	9
have	9
found	9
it,	9
for	9
Don	9
Quixote	9
had	9
kept	9
it,	9
and	9
had	9
never	9
given	9
it	9
to	9
him,	9
nor	9
had	9
he	9
himself	9
thought	9
of	9
asking	9
for	9
it.	9
When	9
Sancho	9
discovered	9
he	9
could	9
not	9
find	9
the	9
book	9
his	9
face	9
grew	9
deadly	9
pale,	9
and	9
in	9
great	9
haste	9
he	9
again	9
felt	9
his	9
body	9
all	9
over,	9
and	9
seeing	9
plainly	9
it	9
was	9
not	9
to	9
be	9
found,	9
without	9
more	9
ado	9
he	9
seized	9
his	9
beard	9
with	9
both	9
hands	9
and	9
plucked	9
away	9
half	9
of	9
it,	9
and	9
then,	9
as	9
quick	9
as	9
he	9
could	9
and	9
without	9
stopping,	9
gave	9
himself	9
half	9
a	9
dozen	9
cuffs	9
on	9
the	9
face	9
and	9
nose	9
till	9
they	9
were	9
bathed	9
in	9
blood.	9
Seeing	9
this,	9
the	9
curate	9
and	9
the	9
barber	9
asked	9
him	9
what	9
had	9
happened	9
him	9
that	9
he	9
gave	9
himself	9
such	9
rough	9
treatment.	9
“What	9
should	9
happen	9
to	9
me?”	9
replied	9
Sancho,	9
“but	9
to	9
have	9
lost	9
from	9
one	9
hand	9
to	9
the	9
other,	9
in	9
a	9
moment,	9
three	9
ass-colts,	9
each	9
of	9
them	9
like	9
a	9
castle?”	9
“How	9
is	9
that?”	9
said	9
the	9
barber.	9
“I	9
have	9
lost	9
the	9
notebook,”	9
said	9
Sancho,	9
“that	9
contained	9
the	9
letter	9
to	9
Dulcinea,	9
and	9
an	9
order	9
signed	9
by	9
my	9
master	9
in	9
which	9
he	9
directed	9
his	9
niece	9
to	9
give	9
me	9
three	9
ass-colts	9
out	9
of	9
four	9
or	9
five	9
he	9
had	9
at	9
home;”	9
and	9
he	9
then	9
told	9
them	9
about	9
the	9
loss	9
of	9
Dapple.	9
The	9
curate	9
consoled	9
him,	9
telling	9
him	9
that	9
when	9
his	9
master	9
was	9
found	9
he	9
would	9
get	9
him	9
to	9
renew	9
the	9
order,	9
and	9
make	9
a	9
fresh	9
draft	9
on	9
paper,	9
as	9
was	9
usual	9
and	9
customary;	9
for	9
those	9
made	9
in	9
notebooks	9
were	9
never	9
accepted	9
or	9
honoured.	9
Sancho	9
comforted	9
himself	9
with	9
this,	9
and	9
said	9
if	9
that	9
were	9
so	9
the	9
loss	9
of	9
Dulcinea’s	9
letter	9
did	9
not	9
trouble	9
him	9
much,	9
for	9
he	9
had	9
it	9
almost	9
by	9
heart,	9
and	9
it	9
could	9
be	9
taken	9
down	9
from	9
him	9
wherever	9
and	9
whenever	9
they	9
liked.	9
“Repeat	9
it	9
then,	9
Sancho,”	9
said	9
the	9
barber,	9
“and	9
we	9
will	9
write	9
it	9
down	9
afterwards.”	9
Sancho	9
Panza	9
stopped	9
to	9
scratch	9
his	9
head	9
to	9
bring	9
back	9
the	9
letter	9
to	9
his	9
memory,	9
and	9
balanced	9
himself	9
now	9
on	9
one	9
foot,	9
now	9
the	9
other,	9
one	9
moment	9
staring	9
at	9
the	9
ground,	9
the	9
next	9
at	9
the	9
sky,	9
and	9
after	9
having	9
half	9
gnawed	9
off	9
the	9
end	9
of	9
a	9
finger	9
and	9
kept	9
them	9
in	9
suspense	9
waiting	9
for	9
him	9
to	9
begin,	9
he	9
said,	9
after	9
a	9
long	9
pause,	9
“By	9
God,	9
señor	9
licentiate,	9
devil	9
a	9
thing	9
can	9
I	9
recollect	9
of	9
the	9
letter;	9
but	9
it	9
said	9
at	9
the	9
beginning,	9
‘Exalted	9
and	9
scrubbing	9
Lady.’”	9
“It	9
cannot	9
have	9
said	9
‘scrubbing,’”	9
said	9
the	9
barber,	9
“but	9
‘superhuman’	9
or	9
‘sovereign.’”	9
“That	9
is	9
it,”	9
said	9
Sancho;	9
“then,	9
as	9
well	9
as	9
I	9
remember,	9
it	9
went	9
on,	9
‘The	9
wounded,	9
and	9
wanting	9
of	9
sleep,	9
and	9
the	9
pierced,	9
kisses	9
your	9
worship’s	9
hands,	9
ungrateful	9
and	9
very	9
unrecognised	9
fair	9
one;	9
and	9
it	9
said	9
something	9
or	9
other	9
about	9
health	9
and	9
sickness	9
that	9
he	9
was	9
sending	9
her;	9
and	9
from	9
that	9
it	9
went	9
tailing	9
off	9
until	9
it	9
ended	9
with	9
‘Yours	9
till	9
death,	9
the	9
Knight	9
of	9
the	9
Rueful	9
Countenance.’”	9
It	9
gave	9
them	9
no	9
little	9
amusement,	9
both	9
of	9
them,	9
to	9
see	9
what	9
a	9
good	9
memory	9
Sancho	9
had,	9
and	9
they	9
complimented	9
him	9
greatly	9
upon	9
it,	9
and	9
begged	9
him	9
to	9
repeat	9
the	9
letter	9
a	9
couple	9
of	9
times	9
more,	9
so	9
that	9
they	9
too	9
might	9
get	9
it	9
by	9
heart	9
to	9
write	9
it	9
out	9
by-and-by.	9
Sancho	9
repeated	9
it	9
three	9
times,	9
and	9
as	9
he	9
did,	9
uttered	9
three	9
thousand	9
more	9
absurdities;	9
then	9
he	9
told	9
them	9
more	9
about	9
his	9
master	9
but	9
he	9
never	9
said	9
a	9
word	9
about	9
the	9
blanketing	9
that	9
had	9
befallen	9
himself	9
in	9
that	9
inn,	9
into	9
which	9
he	9
refused	9
to	9
enter.	9
He	9
told	9
them,	9
moreover,	9
how	9
his	9
lord,	9
if	9
he	9
brought	9
him	9
a	9
favourable	9
answer	9
from	9
the	9
lady	9
Dulcinea	9
del	9
Toboso,	9
was	9
to	9
put	9
himself	9
in	9
the	9
way	9
of	9
endeavouring	9
to	9
become	9
an	9
emperor,	9
or	9
at	9
least	9
a	9
monarch;	9
for	9
it	9
had	9
been	9
so	9
settled	9
between	9
them,	9
and	9
with	9
his	9
personal	9
worth	9
and	9
the	9
might	9
of	9
his	9
arm	9
it	9
was	9
an	9
easy	9
matter	9
to	9
come	9
to	9
be	9
one:	9
and	9
how	9
on	9
becoming	9
one	9
his	9
lord	9
was	9
to	9
make	9
a	9
marriage	9
for	9
him	9
(for	9
he	9
would	9
be	9
a	9
widower	9
by	9
that	9
time,	9
as	9
a	9
matter	9
of	9
course)	9
and	9
was	9
to	9
give	9
him	9
as	9
a	9
wife	9
one	9
of	9
the	9
damsels	9
of	9
the	9
empress,	9
the	9
heiress	9
of	9
some	9
rich	9
and	9
grand	9
state	9
on	9
the	9
mainland,	9
having	9
nothing	9
to	9
do	9
with	9
islands	9
of	9
any	9
sort,	9
for	9
he	9
did	9
not	9
care	9
for	9
them	9
now.	9
All	9
this	9
Sancho	9
delivered	9
with	9
so	9
much	9
composure—wiping	9
his	9
nose	9
from	9
time	9
to	9
time—and	9
with	9
so	9
little	9
common-sense	9
that	9
his	9
two	9
hearers	9
were	9
again	9
filled	9
with	9
wonder	9
at	9
the	9
force	9
of	9
Don	9
Quixote’s	9
madness	9
that	9
could	9
run	9
away	9
with	9
this	9
poor	9
man’s	9
reason.	9
They	9
did	9
not	9
care	9
to	9
take	9
the	9
trouble	9
of	9
disabusing	9
him	9
of	9
his	9
error,	9
as	9
they	9
considered	9
that	9
since	9
it	9
did	9
not	9
in	9
any	9
way	9
hurt	9
his	9
conscience	9
it	9
would	9
be	9
better	9
to	9
leave	9
him	9
in	9
it,	9
and	9
they	9
would	9
have	9
all	9
the	9
more	9
amusement	9
in	9
listening	9
to	9
his	9
simplicities;	9
and	9
so	9
they	9
bade	9
him	9
pray	9
to	9
God	9
for	9
his	9
lord’s	9
health,	9
as	9
it	9
was	9
a	9
very	9
likely	9
and	9
a	9
very	9
feasible	9
thing	9
for	9
him	9
in	9
course	9
of	9
time	9
to	9
come	9
to	9
be	9
an	9
emperor,	9
as	9
he	9
said,	9
or	9
at	9
least	9
an	9
archbishop	9
or	9
some	9
other	9
dignitary	9
of	9
equal	9
rank.	9
To	9
which	9
Sancho	9
made	9
answer,	9
“If	9
fortune,	9
sirs,	9
should	9
bring	9
things	9
about	9
in	9
such	9
a	9
way	9
that	9
my	9
master	9
should	9
have	9
a	9
mind,	9
instead	9
of	9
being	9
an	9
emperor,	9
to	9
be	9
an	9
archbishop,	9
I	9
should	9
like	9
to	9
know	9
what	9
archbishops-errant	9
commonly	9
give	9
their	9
squires?”	9
“They	9
commonly	9
give	9
them,”	9
said	9
the	9
curate,	9
some	9
simple	9
benefice	9
or	9
cure,	9
or	9
some	9
place	9
as	9
sacristan	9
which	9
brings	9
them	9
a	9
good	9
fixed	9
income,	9
not	9
counting	9
the	9
altar	9
fees,	9
which	9
may	9
be	9
reckoned	9
at	9
as	9
much	9
more.”	9
“But	9
for	9
that,”	9
said	9
Sancho,	9
“the	9
squire	9
must	9
be	9
unmarried,	9
and	9
must	9
know,	9
at	9
any	9
rate,	9
how	9
to	9
help	9
at	9
mass,	9
and	9
if	9
that	9
be	9
so,	9
woe	9
is	9
me,	9
for	9
I	9
am	9
married	9
already	9
and	9
I	9
don’t	9
know	9
the	9
first	9
letter	9
of	9
the	9
A	9
B	9
C.	9
What	9
will	9
become	9
of	9
me	9
if	9
my	9
master	9
takes	9
a	9
fancy	9
to	9
be	9
an	9
archbishop	9
and	9
not	9
an	9
emperor,	9
as	9
is	9
usual	9
and	9
customary	9
with	9
knights-errant?”	9
“Be	9
not	9
uneasy,	9
friend	9
Sancho,”	9
said	9
the	9
barber,	9
“for	9
we	9
will	9
entreat	9
your	9
master,	9
and	9
advise	9
him,	9
even	9
urging	9
it	9
upon	9
him	9
as	9
a	9
case	9
of	9
conscience,	9
to	9
become	9
an	9
emperor	9
and	9
not	9
an	9
archbishop,	9
because	9
it	9
will	9
be	9
easier	9
for	9
him	9
as	9
he	9
is	9
more	9
valiant	9
than	9
lettered.”	9
“So	9
I	9
have	9
thought,”	9
said	9
Sancho;	9
“though	9
I	9
can	9
tell	9
you	9
he	9
is	9
fit	9
for	9
anything:	9
what	9
I	9
mean	9
to	9
do	9
for	9
my	9
part	9
is	9
to	9
pray	9
to	9
our	9
Lord	9
to	9
place	9
him	9
where	9
it	9
may	9
be	9
best	9
for	9
him,	9
and	9
where	9
he	9
may	9
be	9
able	9
to	9
bestow	9
most	9
favours	9
upon	9
me.”	9
“You	9
speak	9
like	9
a	9
man	9
of	9
sense,”	9
said	9
the	9
curate,	9
“and	9
you	9
will	9
be	9
acting	9
like	9
a	9
good	9
Christian;	9
but	9
what	9
must	9
now	9
be	9
done	9
is	9
to	9
take	9
steps	9
to	9
coax	9
your	9
master	9
out	9
of	9
that	9
useless	9
penance	9
you	9
say	9
he	9
is	9
performing;	9
and	9
we	9
had	9
best	9
turn	9
into	9
this	9
inn	9
to	9
consider	9
what	9
plan	9
to	9
adopt,	9
and	9
also	9
to	9
dine,	9
for	9
it	9
is	9
now	9
time.”	9
Sancho	9
said	9
they	9
might	9
go	9
in,	9
but	9
that	9
he	9
would	9
wait	9
there	9
outside,	9
and	9
that	9
he	9
would	9
tell	9
them	9
afterwards	9
the	9
reason	9
why	9
he	9
was	9
unwilling,	9
and	9
why	9
it	9
did	9
not	9
suit	9
him	9
to	9
enter	9
it;	9
but	9
he	9
begged	9
them	9
to	9
bring	9
him	9
out	9
something	9
to	9
eat,	9
and	9
to	9
let	9
it	9
be	9
hot,	9
and	9
also	9
to	9
bring	9
barley	9
for	9
Rocinante.	9
They	9
left	9
him	9
and	9
went	9
in,	9
and	9
presently	9
the	9
barber	9
brought	9
him	9
out	9
something	9
to	9
eat.	9
By-and-by,	9
after	9
they	9
had	9
between	9
them	9
carefully	9
thought	9
over	9
what	9
they	9
should	9
do	9
to	9
carry	9
out	9
their	9
object,	9
the	9
curate	9
hit	9
upon	9
an	9
idea	9
very	9
well	9
adapted	9
to	9
humour	9
Don	9
Quixote,	9
and	9
effect	9
their	9
purpose;	9
and	9
his	9
notion,	9
which	9
he	9
explained	9
to	9
the	9
barber,	9
was	9
that	9
he	9
himself	9
should	9
assume	9
the	9
disguise	9
of	9
a	9
wandering	9
damsel,	9
while	9
the	9
other	9
should	9
try	9
as	9
best	9
he	9
could	9
to	9
pass	9
for	9
a	9
squire,	9
and	9
that	9
they	9
should	9
thus	9
proceed	9
to	9
where	9
Don	9
Quixote	9
was,	9
and	9
he,	9
pretending	9
to	9
be	9
an	9
aggrieved	9
and	9
distressed	9
damsel,	9
should	9
ask	9
a	9
favour	9
of	9
him,	9
which	9
as	9
a	9
valiant	9
knight-errant	9
he	9
could	9
not	9
refuse	9
to	9
grant;	9
and	9
the	9
favour	9
he	9
meant	9
to	9
ask	9
him	9
was	9
that	9
he	9
should	9
accompany	9
her	9
whither	9
she	9
would	9
conduct	9
him,	9
in	9
order	9
to	9
redress	9
a	9
wrong	9
which	9
a	9
wicked	9
knight	9
had	9
done	9
her,	9
while	9
at	9
the	9
same	9
time	9
she	9
should	9
entreat	9
him	9
not	9
to	9
require	9
her	9
to	9
remove	9
her	9
mask,	9
nor	9
ask	9
her	9
any	9
question	9
touching	9
her	9
circumstances	9
until	9
he	9
had	9
righted	9
her	9
with	9
the	9
wicked	9
knight.	9
And	9
he	9
had	9
no	9
doubt	9
that	9
Don	9
Quixote	9
would	9
comply	9
with	9
any	9
request	9
made	9
in	9
these	9
terms,	9
and	9
that	9
in	9
this	9
way	9
they	9
might	9
remove	9
him	9
and	9
take	9
him	9
to	9
his	9
own	9
village,	9
where	9
they	9
would	9
endeavour	9
to	9
find	9
out	9
if	9
his	9
extraordinary	9
madness	9
admitted	9
of	9
any	9
kind	9
of	9
remedy.	9

AND	9

PROCEEDED	9
WITH	9
THEIR	9

Size	9
The	9
curate’s	9
plan	9
did	9
not	9
seem	9
a	9
bad	9
one	9
to	9
the	9
barber,	9
but	9
on	9
the	9
contrary	9
so	9
good	9
that	9
they	9
immediately	9
set	9
about	9
putting	9
it	9
in	9
execution.	9
They	9
begged	9
a	9
petticoat	9
and	9
hood	9
of	9
the	9
landlady,	9
leaving	9
her	9
in	9
pledge	9
a	9
new	9
cassock	9
of	9
the	9
curate’s;	9
and	9
the	9
barber	9
made	9
a	9
beard	9
out	9
of	9
a	9
grey-brown	9
or	9
red	9
ox-tail	9
in	9
which	9
the	9
landlord	9
used	9
to	9
stick	9
his	9
comb.	9
The	9
landlady	9
asked	9
them	9
what	9
they	9
wanted	9
these	9
things	9
for,	9
and	9
the	9
curate	9
told	9
her	9
in	9
a	9
few	9
words	9
about	9
the	9
madness	9
of	9
Don	9
Quixote,	9
and	9
how	9
this	9
disguise	9
was	9
intended	9
to	9
get	9
him	9
away	9
from	9
the	9
mountain	9
where	9
he	9
then	9
was.	9
The	9
landlord	9
and	9
landlady	9
immediately	9
came	9
to	9
the	9
conclusion	9
that	9
the	9
madman	9
was	9
their	9
guest,	9
the	9
balsam	9
man	9
and	9
master	9
of	9
the	9
blanketed	9
squire,	9
and	9
they	9
told	9
the	9
curate	9
all	9
that	9
had	9
passed	9
between	9
him	9
and	9
them,	9
not	9
omitting	9
what	9
Sancho	9
had	9
been	9
so	9
silent	9
about.	9
Finally	9
the	9
landlady	9
dressed	9
up	9
the	9
curate	9
in	9
a	9
style	9
that	9
left	9
nothing	9
to	9
be	9
desired;	9
she	9
put	9
on	9
him	9
a	9
cloth	9
petticoat	9
with	9
black	9
velvet	9
stripes	9
a	9
palm	9
broad,	9
all	9
slashed,	9
and	9
a	9
bodice	9
of	9
green	9
velvet	9
set	9
off	9
by	9
a	9
binding	9
of	9
white	9
satin,	9
which	9
as	9
well	9
as	9
the	9
petticoat	9
must	9
have	9
been	9
made	9
in	9
the	9
time	9
of	9
king	9
Wamba.	9
The	9
curate	9
would	9
not	9
let	9
them	9
hood	9
him,	9
but	9
put	9
on	9
his	9
head	9
a	9
little	9
quilted	9
linen	9
cap	9
which	9
he	9
used	9
for	9
a	9
night-cap,	9
and	9
bound	9
his	9
forehead	9
with	9
a	9
strip	9
of	9
black	9
silk,	9
while	9
with	9
another	9
he	9
made	9
a	9
mask	9
with	9
which	9
he	9
concealed	9
his	9
beard	9
and	9
face	9
very	9
well.	9
He	9
then	9
put	9
on	9
his	9
hat,	9
which	9
was	9
broad	9
enough	9
to	9
serve	9
him	9
for	9
an	9
umbrella,	9
and	9
enveloping	9
himself	9
in	9
his	9
cloak	9
seated	9
himself	9
woman-fashion	9
on	9
his	9
mule,	9
while	9
the	9
barber	9
mounted	9
his	9
with	9
a	9
beard	9
down	9
to	9
the	9
waist	9
of	9
mingled	9
red	9
and	9
white,	9
for	9
it	9
was,	9
as	9
has	9
been	9
said,	9
the	9
tail	9
of	9
a	9
clay-red	9
ox.	9
They	9
took	9
leave	9
of	9
all,	9
and	9
of	9
the	9
good	9
Maritornes,	9
who,	9
sinner	9
as	9
she	9
was,	9
promised	9
to	9
pray	9
a	9
rosary	9
of	9
prayers	9
that	9
God	9
might	9
grant	9
them	9
success	9
in	9
such	9
an	9
arduous	9
and	9
Christian	9
undertaking	9
as	9
that	9
they	9
had	9
in	9
hand.	9
But	9
hardly	9
had	9
he	9
sallied	9
forth	9
from	9
the	9
inn	9
when	9
it	9
struck	9
the	9
curate	9
that	9
he	9
was	9
doing	9
wrong	9
in	9
rigging	9
himself	9
out	9
in	9
that	9
fashion,	9
as	9
it	9
was	9
an	9
indecorous	9
thing	9
for	9
a	9
priest	9
to	9
dress	9
himself	9
that	9
way	9
even	9
though	9
much	9
might	9
depend	9
upon	9
it;	9
and	9
saying	9
so	9
to	9
the	9
barber	9
he	9
begged	9
him	9
to	9
change	9
dresses,	9
as	9
it	9
was	9
fitter	9
he	9
should	9
be	9
the	9
distressed	9
damsel,	9
while	9
he	9
himself	9
would	9
play	9
the	9
squire’s	9
part,	9
which	9
would	9
be	9
less	9
derogatory	9
to	9
his	9
dignity;	9
otherwise	9
he	9
was	9
resolved	9
to	9
have	9
nothing	9
more	9
to	9
do	9
with	9
the	9
matter,	9
and	9
let	9
the	9
devil	9
take	9
Don	9
Quixote.	9
Just	9
at	9
this	9
moment	9
Sancho	9
came	9
up,	9
and	9
on	9
seeing	9
the	9
pair	9
in	9
such	9
a	9
costume	9
he	9
was	9
unable	9
to	9
restrain	9
his	9
laughter;	9
the	9
barber,	9
however,	9
agreed	9
to	9
do	9
as	9
the	9
curate	9
wished,	9
and,	9
altering	9
their	9
plan,	9
the	9
curate	9
went	9
on	9
to	9
instruct	9
him	9
how	9
to	9
play	9
his	9
part	9
and	9
what	9
to	9
say	9
to	9
Don	9
Quixote	9
to	9
induce	9
and	9
compel	9
him	9
to	9
come	9
with	9
them	9
and	9
give	9
up	9
his	9
fancy	9
for	9
the	9
place	9
he	9
had	9
chosen	9
for	9
his	9
idle	9
penance.	9
The	9
barber	9
told	9
him	9
he	9
could	9
manage	9
it	9
properly	9
without	9
any	9
instruction,	9
and	9
as	9
he	9
did	9
not	9
care	9
to	9
dress	9
himself	9
up	9
until	9
they	9
were	9
near	9
where	9
Don	9
Quixote	9
was,	9
he	9
folded	9
up	9
the	9
garments,	9
and	9
the	9
curate	9
adjusted	9
his	9
beard,	9
and	9
they	9
set	9
out	9
under	9
the	9
guidance	9
of	9
Sancho	9
Panza,	9
who	9
went	9
along	9
telling	9
them	9
of	9
the	9
encounter	9
with	9
the	9
madman	9
they	9
met	9
in	9
the	9
Sierra,	9
saying	9
nothing,	9
however,	9
about	9
the	9
finding	9
of	9
the	9
valise	9
and	9
its	9
contents;	9
for	9
with	9
all	9
his	9
simplicity	9
the	9
lad	9
was	9
a	9
trifle	9
covetous.	9
The	9
next	9
day	9
they	9
reached	9
the	9
place	9
where	9
Sancho	9
had	9
laid	9
the	9
broom-branches	9
as	9
marks	9
to	9
direct	9
him	9
to	9
where	9
he	9
had	9
left	9
his	9
master,	9
and	9
recognising	9
it	9
he	9
told	9
them	9
that	9
here	9
was	9
the	9
entrance,	9
and	9
that	9
they	9
would	9
do	9
well	9
to	9
dress	9
themselves,	9
if	9
that	9
was	9
required	9
to	9
deliver	9
his	9
master;	9
for	9
they	9
had	9
already	9
told	9
him	9
that	9
going	9
in	9
this	9
guise	9
and	9
dressing	9
in	9
this	9
way	9
were	9
of	9
the	9
highest	9
importance	9
in	9
order	9
to	9
rescue	9
his	9
master	9
from	9
the	9
pernicious	9
life	9
he	9
had	9
adopted;	9
and	9
they	9
charged	9
him	9
strictly	9
not	9
to	9
tell	9
his	9
master	9
who	9
they	9
were,	9
or	9
that	9
he	9
knew	9
them,	9
and	9
should	9
he	9
ask,	9
as	9
ask	9
he	9
would,	9
if	9
he	9
had	9
given	9
the	9
letter	9
to	9
Dulcinea,	9
to	9
say	9
that	9
he	9
had,	9
and	9
that,	9
as	9
she	9
did	9
not	9
know	9
how	9
to	9
read,	9
she	9
had	9
given	9
an	9
answer	9
by	9
word	9
of	9
mouth,	9
saying	9
that	9
she	9
commanded	9
him,	9
on	9
pain	9
of	9
her	9
displeasure,	9
to	9
come	9
and	9
see	9
her	9
at	9
once;	9
and	9
it	9
was	9
a	9
very	9
important	9
matter	9
for	9
himself,	9
because	9
in	9
this	9
way	9
and	9
with	9
what	9
they	9
meant	9
to	9
say	9
to	9
him	9
they	9
felt	9
sure	9
of	9
bringing	9
him	9
back	9
to	9
a	9
better	9
mode	9
of	9
life	9
and	9
inducing	9
him	9
to	9
take	9
immediate	9
steps	9
to	9
become	9
an	9
emperor	9
or	9
monarch,	9
for	9
there	9
was	9
no	9
fear	9
of	9
his	9
becoming	9
an	9
archbishop.	9
All	9
this	9
Sancho	9
listened	9
to	9
and	9
fixed	9
it	9
well	9
in	9
his	9
memory,	9
and	9
thanked	9
them	9
heartily	9
for	9
intending	9
to	9
recommend	9
his	9
master	9
to	9
be	9
an	9
emperor	9
instead	9
of	9
an	9
archbishop,	9
for	9
he	9
felt	9
sure	9
that	9
in	9
the	9
way	9
of	9
bestowing	9
rewards	9
on	9
their	9
squires	9
emperors	9
could	9
do	9
more	9
than	9
archbishops-errant.	9
He	9
said,	9
too,	9
that	9
it	9
would	9
be	9
as	9
well	9
for	9
him	9
to	9
go	9
on	9
before	9
them	9
to	9
find	9
him,	9
and	9
give	9
him	9
his	9
lady’s	9
answer;	9
for	9
that	9
perhaps	9
might	9
be	9
enough	9
to	9
bring	9
him	9
away	9
from	9
the	9
place	9
without	9
putting	9
them	9
to	9
all	9
this	9
trouble.	9
They	9
approved	9
of	9
what	9
Sancho	9
proposed,	9
and	9
resolved	9
to	9
wait	9
for	9
him	9
until	9
he	9
brought	9
back	9
word	9
of	9
having	9
found	9
his	9
master.	9
Sancho	9
pushed	9
on	9
into	9
the	9
glens	9
of	9
the	9
Sierra,	9
leaving	9
them	9
in	9
one	9
through	9
which	9
there	9
flowed	9
a	9
little	9
gentle	9
rivulet,	9
and	9
where	9
the	9
rocks	9
and	9
trees	9
afforded	9
a	9
cool	9
and	9
grateful	9
shade.	9
It	9
was	9
an	9
August	9
day	9
with	9
all	9
the	9
heat	9
of	9
one,	9
and	9
the	9
heat	9
in	9
those	9
parts	9
is	9
intense,	9
and	9
the	9
hour	9
was	9
three	9
in	9
the	9
afternoon,	9
all	9
which	9
made	9
the	9
spot	9
the	9
more	9
inviting	9
and	9
tempted	9
them	9
to	9
wait	9
there	9
for	9
Sancho’s	9
return,	9
which	9
they	9
did.	9
They	9
were	9
reposing,	9
then,	9
in	9
the	9
shade,	9
when	9
a	9
voice	9
unaccompanied	9
by	9
the	9
notes	9
of	9
any	9
instrument,	9
but	9
sweet	9
and	9
pleasing	9
in	9
its	9
tone,	9
reached	9
their	9
ears,	9
at	9
which	9
they	9
were	9
not	9
a	9
little	9
astonished,	9
as	9
the	9
place	9
did	9
not	9
seem	9
to	9
them	9
likely	9
quarters	9
for	9
one	9
who	9
sang	9
so	9
well;	9
for	9
though	9
it	9
is	9
often	9
said	9
that	9
shepherds	9
of	9
rare	9
voice	9
are	9
to	9
be	9
found	9
in	9
the	9
woods	9
and	9
fields,	9
this	9
is	9
rather	9
a	9
flight	9
of	9
the	9
poet’s	9
fancy	9
than	9
the	9
truth.	9
And	9
still	9
more	9
surprised	9
were	9
they	9
when	9
they	9
perceived	9
that	9
what	9
they	9
heard	9
sung	9
were	9
the	9
verses	9
not	9
of	9
rustic	9
shepherds,	9
but	9
of	9
the	9
polished	9
wits	9
of	9
the	9
city;	9
and	9
so	9
it	9
proved,	9
for	9
the	9
verses	9
they	9
heard	9
were	9
these:	9
What	9
makes	9
my	9
quest	9
of	9
happiness	9
seem	9
vain?	9
Disdain.	9
What	9
bids	9
me	9
to	9
abandon	9
hope	9
of	9
ease?	9
Jealousies.	9
What	9
holds	9
my	9
heart	9
in	9
anguish	9
of	9
suspense?	9
Absence.	9
If	9
that	9
be	9
so,	9
then	9
for	9
my	9
grief	9
Where	9
shall	9
I	9
turn	9
to	9
seek	9
relief,	9
When	9
hope	9
on	9
every	9
side	9
lies	9
slain	9
By	9
Absence,	9
Jealousies,	9
Disdain?	9
What	9
the	9
prime	9
cause	9
of	9
all	9
my	9
woe	9
doth	9
prove?	9
Love.	9
What	9
at	9
my	9
glory	9
ever	9
looks	9
askance?	9
Chance.	9
Whence	9
is	9
permission	9
to	9
afflict	9
me	9
given?	9
Heaven.	9
If	9
that	9
be	9
so,	9
I	9
but	9
await	9
The	9
stroke	9
of	9
a	9
resistless	9
fate,	9
Since,	9
working	9
for	9
my	9
woe,	9
these	9
three,	9
Love,	9
Chance	9
and	9
Heaven,	9
in	9
league	9
I	9
see.	9
What	9
must	9
I	9
do	9
to	9
find	9
a	9
remedy?	9
Die.	9
What	9
is	9
the	9
lure	9
for	9
love	9
when	9
coy	9
and	9
strange?	9
Change.	9
What,	9
if	9
all	9
fail,	9
will	9
cure	9
the	9
heart	9
of	9
sadness?	9
Madness.	9
If	9
that	9
be	9
so,	9
it	9
is	9
but	9
folly	9
To	9
seek	9
a	9
cure	9
for	9
melancholy:	9
Ask	9
where	9
it	9
lies;	9
the	9
answer	9
saith	9
In	9
Change,	9
in	9
Madness,	9
or	9
in	9
Death.	9
The	9
hour,	9
the	9
summer	9
season,	9
the	9
solitary	9
place,	9
the	9
voice	9
and	9
skill	9
of	9
the	9
singer,	9
all	9
contributed	9
to	9
the	9
wonder	9
and	9
delight	9
of	9
the	9
two	9
listeners,	9
who	9
remained	9
still	9
waiting	9
to	9
hear	9
something	9
more;	9
finding,	9
however,	9
that	9
the	9
silence	9
continued	9
some	9
little	9
time,	9
they	9
resolved	9
to	9
go	9
in	9
search	9
of	9
the	9
musician	9
who	9
sang	9
with	9
so	9
fine	9
a	9
voice;	9
but	9
just	9
as	9
they	9
were	9
about	9
to	9
do	9
so	9
they	9
were	9
checked	9
by	9
the	9
same	9
voice,	9
which	9
once	9
more	9
fell	9
upon	9
their	9
ears,	9
singing	9
this	9
SONNET	9
When	9
heavenward,	9
holy	9
Friendship,	9
thou	9
didst	9
go	9
Soaring	9
to	9
seek	9
thy	9
home	9
beyond	9
the	9
sky,	9
And	9
take	9
thy	9
seat	9
among	9
the	9
saints	9
on	9
high,	9
It	9
was	9
thy	9
will	9
to	9
leave	9
on	9
earth	9
below	9
Thy	9
semblance,	9
and	9
upon	9
it	9
to	9
bestow	9
Thy	9
veil,	9
wherewith	9
at	9
times	9
hypocrisy,	9
Parading	9
in	9
thy	9
shape,	9
deceives	9
the	9
eye,	9
And	9
makes	9
its	9
vileness	9
bright	9
as	9
virtue	9
show.	9
Friendship,	9
return	9
to	9
us,	9
or	9
force	9
the	9
cheat	9
That	9
wears	9
it	9
now,	9
thy	9
livery	9
to	9
restore,	9
By	9
aid	9
whereof	9
sincerity	9
is	9
slain.	9
If	9
thou	9
wilt	9
not	9
unmask	9
thy	9
counterfeit,	9
This	9
earth	9
will	9
be	9
the	9
prey	9
of	9
strife	9
once	9
more,	9
As	9
when	9
primæval	9
discord	9
held	9
its	9
reign.	9
The	9
song	9
ended	9
with	9
a	9
deep	9
sigh,	9
and	9
again	9
the	9
listeners	9
remained	9
waiting	9
attentively	9
for	9
the	9
singer	9
to	9
resume;	9
but	9
perceiving	9
that	9
the	9
music	9
had	9
now	9
turned	9
to	9
sobs	9
and	9
heart-rending	9
moans	9
they	9
determined	9
to	9
find	9
out	9
who	9
the	9
unhappy	9
being	9
could	9
be	9
whose	9
voice	9
was	9
as	9
rare	9
as	9
his	9
sighs	9
were	9
piteous,	9
and	9
they	9
had	9
not	9
proceeded	9
far	9
when	9
on	9
turning	9
the	9
corner	9
of	9
a	9
rock	9
they	9
discovered	9
a	9
man	9
of	9
the	9
same	9
aspect	9
and	9
appearance	9
as	9
Sancho	9
had	9
described	9
to	9
them	9
when	9
he	9
told	9
them	9
the	9
story	9
of	9
Cardenio.	9
He,	9
showing	9
no	9
astonishment	9
when	9
he	9
saw	9
them,	9
stood	9
still	9
with	9
his	9
head	9
bent	9
down	9
upon	9
his	9
breast	9
like	9
one	9
in	9
deep	9
thought,	9
without	9
raising	9
his	9
eyes	9
to	9
look	9
at	9
them	9
after	9
the	9
first	9
glance	9
when	9
they	9
suddenly	9
came	9
upon	9
him.	9
The	9
curate,	9
who	9
was	9
aware	9
of	9
his	9
misfortune	9
and	9
recognised	9
him	9
by	9
the	9
description,	9
being	9
a	9
man	9
of	9
good	9
address,	9
approached	9
him	9
and	9
in	9
a	9
few	9
sensible	9
words	9
entreated	9
and	9
urged	9
him	9
to	9
quit	9
a	9
life	9
of	9
such	9
misery,	9
lest	9
he	9
should	9
end	9
it	9
there,	9
which	9
would	9
be	9
the	9
greatest	9
of	9
all	9
misfortunes.	9
Cardenio	9
was	9
then	9
in	9
his	9
right	9
mind,	9
free	9
from	9
any	9
attack	9
of	9
that	9
madness	9
which	9
so	9
frequently	9
carried	9
him	9
away,	9
and	9
seeing	9
them	9
dressed	9
in	9
a	9
fashion	9
so	9
unusual	9
among	9
the	9
frequenters	9
of	9
those	9
wilds,	9
could	9
not	9
help	9
showing	9
some	9
surprise,	9
especially	9
when	9
he	9
heard	9
them	9
speak	9
of	9
his	9
case	9
as	9
if	9
it	9
were	9
a	9
well-known	9
matter	9
(for	9
the	9
curate’s	9
words	9
gave	9
him	9
to	9
understand	9
as	9
much)	9
so	9
he	9
replied	9
to	9
them	9
thus:	9
“I	9
see	9
plainly,	9
sirs,	9
whoever	9
you	9
may	9
be,	9
that	9
Heaven,	9
whose	9
care	9
it	9
is	9
to	9
succour	9
the	9
good,	9
and	9
even	9
the	9
wicked	9
very	9
often,	9
here,	9
in	9
this	9
remote	9
spot,	9
cut	9
off	9
from	9
human	9
intercourse,	9
sends	9
me,	9
though	9
I	9
deserve	9
it	9
not,	9
those	9
who	9
seek	9
to	9
draw	9
me	9
away	9
from	9
this	9
to	9
some	9
better	9
retreat,	9
showing	9
me	9
by	9
many	9
and	9
forcible	9
arguments	9
how	9
unreasonably	9
I	9
act	9
in	9
leading	9
the	9
life	9
I	9
do;	9
but	9
as	9
they	9
know,	9
that	9
if	9
I	9
escape	9
from	9
this	9
evil	9
I	9
shall	9
fall	9
into	9
another	9
still	9
greater,	9
perhaps	9
they	9
will	9
set	9
me	9
down	9
as	9
a	9
weak-minded	9
man,	9
or,	9
what	9
is	9
worse,	9
one	9
devoid	9
of	9
reason;	9
nor	9
would	9
it	9
be	9
any	9
wonder,	9
for	9
I	9
myself	9
can	9
perceive	9
that	9
the	9
effect	9
of	9
the	9
recollection	9
of	9
my	9
misfortunes	9
is	9
so	9
great	9
and	9
works	9
so	9
powerfully	9
to	9
my	9
ruin,	9
that	9
in	9
spite	9
of	9
myself	9
I	9
become	9
at	9
times	9
like	9
a	9
stone,	9
without	9
feeling	9
or	9
consciousness;	9
and	9
I	9
come	9
to	9
feel	9
the	9
truth	9
of	9
it	9
when	9
they	9
tell	9
me	9
and	9
show	9
me	9
proofs	9
of	9
the	9
things	9
I	9
have	9
done	9
when	9
the	9
terrible	9
fit	9
overmasters	9
me;	9
and	9
all	9
I	9
can	9
do	9
is	9
bewail	9
my	9
lot	9
in	9
vain,	9
and	9
idly	9
curse	9
my	9
destiny,	9
and	9
plead	9
for	9
my	9
madness	9
by	9
telling	9
how	9
it	9
was	9
caused,	9
to	9
any	9
that	9
care	9
to	9
hear	9
it;	9
for	9
no	9
reasonable	9
beings	9
on	9
learning	9
the	9
cause	9
will	9
wonder	9
at	9
the	9
effects;	9
and	9
if	9
they	9
cannot	9
help	9
me	9
at	9
least	9
they	9
will	9
not	9
blame	9
me,	9
and	9
the	9
repugnance	9
they	9
feel	9
at	9
my	9
wild	9
ways	9
will	9
turn	9
into	9
pity	9
for	9
my	9
woes.	9
If	9
it	9
be,	9
sirs,	9
that	9
you	9
are	9
here	9
with	9
the	9
same	9
design	9
as	9
others	9
have	9
come	9
with,	9
before	9
you	9
proceed	9
with	9
your	9
wise	9
arguments,	9
I	9
entreat	9
you	9
to	9
hear	9
the	9
story	9
of	9
my	9
countless	9
misfortunes,	9
for	9
perhaps	9
when	9
you	9
have	9
heard	9
it	9
you	9
will	9
spare	9
yourselves	9
the	9
trouble	9
you	9
would	9
take	9
in	9
offering	9
consolation	9
to	9
grief	9
that	9
is	9
beyond	9
the	9
reach	9
of	9
it.”	9
As	9
they,	9
both	9
of	9
them,	9
desired	9
nothing	9
more	9
than	9
to	9
hear	9
from	9
his	9
own	9
lips	9
the	9
cause	9
of	9
his	9
suffering,	9
they	9
entreated	9
him	9
to	9
tell	9
it,	9
promising	9
not	9
to	9
do	9
anything	9
for	9
his	9
relief	9
or	9
comfort	9
that	9
he	9
did	9
not	9
wish;	9
and	9
thereupon	9
the	9
unhappy	9
gentleman	9
began	9
his	9
sad	9
story	9
in	9
nearly	9
the	9
same	9
words	9
and	9
manner	9
in	9
which	9
he	9
had	9
related	9
it	9
to	9
Don	9
Quixote	9
and	9
the	9
goatherd	9
a	9
few	9
days	9
before,	9
when,	9
through	9
Master	9
Elisabad,	9
and	9
Don	9
Quixote’s	9
scrupulous	9
observance	9
of	9
what	9
was	9
due	9
to	9
chivalry,	9
the	9
tale	9
was	9
left	9
unfinished,	9
as	9
this	9
history	9
has	9
already	9
recorded;	9
but	9
now	9
fortunately	9
the	9
mad	9
fit	9
kept	9
off,	9
allowed	9
him	9
to	9
tell	9
it	9
to	9
the	9
end;	9
and	9
so,	9
coming	9
to	9
the	9
incident	9
of	9
the	9
note	9
which	9
Don	9
Fernando	9
had	9
found	9
in	9
the	9
volume	9
of	9
“Amadis	9
of	9
Gaul,”	9
Cardenio	9
said	9
that	9
he	9
remembered	9
it	9
perfectly	9
and	9
that	9
it	9
was	9
in	9
these	9
words:	9
“_Luscinda	9
to	9
Cardenio._	9
“Every	9
day	9
I	9
discover	9
merits	9
in	9
you	9
that	9
oblige	9
and	9
compel	9
me	9
to	9
hold	9
you	9
in	9
higher	9
estimation;	9
so	9
if	9
you	9
desire	9
to	9
relieve	9
me	9
of	9
this	9
obligation	9
without	9
cost	9
to	9
my	9
honour,	9
you	9
may	9
easily	9
do	9
so.	9
I	9
have	9
a	9
father	9
who	9
knows	9
you	9
and	9
loves	9
me	9
dearly,	9
who	9
without	9
putting	9
any	9
constraint	9
on	9
my	9
inclination	9
will	9
grant	9
what	9
will	9
be	9
reasonable	9
for	9
you	9
to	9
have,	9
if	9
it	9
be	9
that	9
you	9
value	9
me	9
as	9
you	9
say	9
and	9
as	9
I	9
believe	9
you	9
do.”	9
“By	9
this	9
letter	9
I	9
was	9
induced,	9
as	9
I	9
told	9
you,	9
to	9
demand	9
Luscinda	9
for	9
my	9
wife,	9
and	9
it	9
was	9
through	9
it	9
that	9
Luscinda	9
came	9
to	9
be	9
regarded	9
by	9
Don	9
Fernando	9
as	9
one	9
of	9
the	9
most	9
discreet	9
and	9
prudent	9
women	9
of	9
the	9
day,	9
and	9
this	9
letter	9
it	9
was	9
that	9
suggested	9
his	9
design	9
of	9
ruining	9
me	9
before	9
mine	9
could	9
be	9
carried	9
into	9
effect.	9
I	9
told	9
Don	9
Fernando	9
that	9
all	9
Luscinda’s	9
father	9
was	9
waiting	9
for	9
was	9
that	9
mine	9
should	9
ask	9
her	9
of	9
him,	9
which	9
I	9
did	9
not	9
dare	9
to	9
suggest	9
to	9
him,	9
fearing	9
that	9
he	9
would	9
not	9
consent	9
to	9
do	9
so;	9
not	9
because	9
he	9
did	9
not	9
know	9
perfectly	9
well	9
the	9
rank,	9
goodness,	9
virtue,	9
and	9
beauty	9
of	9
Luscinda,	9
and	9
that	9
she	9
had	9
qualities	9
that	9
would	9
do	9
honour	9
to	9
any	9
family	9
in	9
Spain,	9
but	9
because	9
I	9
was	9
aware	9
that	9
he	9
did	9
not	9
wish	9
me	9
to	9
marry	9
so	9
soon,	9
before	9
seeing	9
what	9
the	9
Duke	9
Ricardo	9
would	9
do	9
for	9
me.	9
In	9
short,	9
I	9
told	9
him	9
I	9
did	9
not	9
venture	9
to	9
mention	9
it	9
to	9
my	9
father,	9
as	9
well	9
on	9
account	9
of	9
that	9
difficulty,	9
as	9
of	9
many	9
others	9
that	9
discouraged	9
me	9
though	9
I	9
knew	9
not	9
well	9
what	9
they	9
were,	9
only	9
that	9
it	9
seemed	9
to	9
me	9
that	9
what	9
I	9
desired	9
was	9
never	9
to	9
come	9
to	9
pass.	9
To	9
all	9
this	9
Don	9
Fernando	9
answered	9
that	9
he	9
would	9
take	9
it	9
upon	9
himself	9
to	9
speak	9
to	9
my	9
father,	9
and	9
persuade	9
him	9
to	9
speak	9
to	9
Luscinda’s	9
father.	9
O,	9
ambitious	9
Marius!	9
O,	9
cruel	9
Catiline!	9
O,	9
wicked	9
Sylla!	9
O,	9
perfidious	9
Ganelon!	9
O,	9
treacherous	9
Vellido!	9
O,	9
vindictive	9
Julian!	9
O,	9
covetous	9
Judas!	9
Traitor,	9
cruel,	9
vindictive,	9
and	9
perfidious,	9
wherein	9
had	9
this	9
poor	9
wretch	9
failed	9
in	9
his	9
fidelity,	9
who	9
with	9
such	9
frankness	9
showed	9
thee	9
the	9
secrets	9
and	9
the	9
joys	9
of	9
his	9
heart?	9
What	9
offence	9
did	9
I	9
commit?	9
What	9
words	9
did	9
I	9
utter,	9
or	9
what	9
counsels	9
did	9
I	9
give	9
that	9
had	9
not	9
the	9
furtherance	9
of	9
thy	9
honour	9
and	9
welfare	9
for	9
their	9
aim?	9
But,	9
woe	9
is	9
me,	9
wherefore	9
do	9
I	9
complain?	9
for	9
sure	9
it	9
is	9
that	9
when	9
misfortunes	9
spring	9
from	9
the	9
stars,	9
descending	9
from	9
on	9
high	9
they	9
fall	9
upon	9
us	9
with	9
such	9
fury	9
and	9
violence	9
that	9
no	9
power	9
on	9
earth	9
can	9
check	9
their	9
course	9
nor	9
human	9
device	9
stay	9
their	9
coming.	9
Who	9
could	9
have	9
thought	9
that	9
Don	9
Fernando,	9
a	9
highborn	9
gentleman,	9
intelligent,	9
bound	9
to	9
me	9
by	9
gratitude	9
for	9
my	9
services,	9
one	9
that	9
could	9
win	9
the	9
object	9
of	9
his	9
love	9
wherever	9
he	9
might	9
set	9
his	9
affections,	9
could	9
have	9
become	9
so	9
obdurate,	9
as	9
they	9
say,	9
as	9
to	9
rob	9
me	9
of	9
my	9
one	9
ewe	9
lamb	9
that	9
was	9
not	9
even	9
yet	9
in	9
my	9
possession?	9
But	9
laying	9
aside	9
these	9
useless	9
and	9
unavailing	9
reflections,	9
let	9
us	9
take	9
up	9
the	9
broken	9
thread	9
of	9
my	9
unhappy	9
story.	9
“To	9
proceed,	9
then:	9
Don	9
Fernando	9
finding	9
my	9
presence	9
an	9
obstacle	9
to	9
the	9
execution	9
of	9
his	9
treacherous	9
and	9
wicked	9
design,	9
resolved	9
to	9
send	9
me	9
to	9
his	9
elder	9
brother	9
under	9
the	9
pretext	9
of	9
asking	9
money	9
from	9
him	9
to	9
pay	9
for	9
six	9
horses	9
which,	9
purposely,	9
and	9
with	9
the	9
sole	9
object	9
of	9
sending	9
me	9
away	9
that	9
he	9
might	9
the	9
better	9
carry	9
out	9
his	9
infernal	9
scheme,	9
he	9
had	9
purchased	9
the	9
very	9
day	9
he	9
offered	9
to	9
speak	9
to	9
my	9
father,	9
and	9
the	9
price	9
of	9
which	9
he	9
now	9
desired	9
me	9
to	9
fetch.	9
Could	9
I	9
have	9
anticipated	9
this	9
treachery?	9
Could	9
I	9
by	9
any	9
chance	9
have	9
suspected	9
it?	9
Nay;	9
so	9
far	9
from	9
that,	9
I	9
offered	9
with	9
the	9
greatest	9
pleasure	9
to	9
go	9
at	9
once,	9
in	9
my	9
satisfaction	9
at	9
the	9
good	9
bargain	9
that	9
had	9
been	9
made.	9
That	9
night	9
I	9
spoke	9
with	9
Luscinda,	9
and	9
told	9
her	9
what	9
had	9
been	9
agreed	9
upon	9
with	9
Don	9
Fernando,	9
and	9
how	9
I	9
had	9
strong	9
hopes	9
of	9
our	9
fair	9
and	9
reasonable	9
wishes	9
being	9
realised.	9
She,	9
as	9
unsuspicious	9
as	9
I	9
was	9
of	9
the	9
treachery	9
of	9
Don	9
Fernando,	9
bade	9
me	9
try	9
to	9
return	9
speedily,	9
as	9
she	9
believed	9
the	9
fulfilment	9
of	9
our	9
desires	9
would	9
be	9
delayed	9
only	9
so	9
long	9
as	9
my	9
father	9
put	9
off	9
speaking	9
to	9
hers.	9
I	9
know	9
not	9
why	9
it	9
was	9
that	9
on	9
saying	9
this	9
to	9
me	9
her	9
eyes	9
filled	9
with	9
tears,	9
and	9
there	9
came	9
a	9
lump	9
in	9
her	9
throat	9
that	9
prevented	9
her	9
from	9
uttering	9
a	9
word	9
of	9
many	9
more	9
that	9
it	9
seemed	9
to	9
me	9
she	9
was	9
striving	9
to	9
say	9
to	9
me.	9
I	9
was	9
astonished	9
at	9
this	9
unusual	9
turn,	9
which	9
I	9
never	9
before	9
observed	9
in	9
her.	9
for	9
we	9
always	9
conversed,	9
whenever	9
good	9
fortune	9
and	9
my	9
ingenuity	9
gave	9
us	9
the	9
chance,	9
with	9
the	9
greatest	9
gaiety	9
and	9
cheerfulness,	9
mingling	9
tears,	9
sighs,	9
jealousies,	9
doubts,	9
or	9
fears	9
with	9
our	9
words;	9
it	9
was	9
all	9
on	9
my	9
part	9
a	9
eulogy	9
of	9
my	9
good	9
fortune	9
that	9
Heaven	9
should	9
have	9
given	9
her	9
to	9
me	9
for	9
my	9
mistress;	9
I	9
glorified	9
her	9
beauty,	9
I	9
extolled	9
her	9
worth	9
and	9
her	9
understanding;	9
and	9
she	9
paid	9
me	9
back	9
by	9
praising	9
in	9
me	9
what	9
in	9
her	9
love	9
for	9
me	9
she	9
thought	9
worthy	9
of	9
praise;	9
and	9
besides	9
we	9
had	9
a	9
hundred	9
thousand	9
trifles	9
and	9
doings	9
of	9
our	9
neighbours	9
and	9
acquaintances	9
to	9
talk	9
about,	9
and	9
the	9
utmost	9
extent	9
of	9
my	9
boldness	9
was	9
to	9
take,	9
almost	9
by	9
force,	9
one	9
of	9
her	9
fair	9
white	9
hands	9
and	9
carry	9
it	9
to	9
my	9
lips,	9
as	9
well	9
as	9
the	9
closeness	9
of	9
the	9
low	9
grating	9
that	9
separated	9
us	9
allowed	9
me.	9
But	9
the	9
night	9
before	9
the	9
unhappy	9
day	9
of	9
my	9
departure	9
she	9
wept,	9
she	9
moaned,	9
she	9
sighed,	9
and	9
she	9
withdrew	9
leaving	9
me	9
filled	9
with	9
perplexity	9
and	9
amazement,	9
overwhelmed	9
at	9
the	9
sight	9
of	9
such	9
strange	9
and	9
affecting	9
signs	9
of	9
grief	9
and	9
sorrow	9
in	9
Luscinda;	9
but	9
not	9
to	9
dash	9
my	9
hopes	9
I	9
ascribed	9
it	9
all	9
to	9
the	9
depth	9
of	9
her	9
love	9
for	9
me	9
and	9
the	9
pain	9
that	9
separation	9
gives	9
those	9
who	9
love	9
tenderly.	9
At	9
last	9
I	9
took	9
my	9
departure,	9
sad	9
and	9
dejected,	9
my	9
heart	9
filled	9
with	9
fancies	9
and	9
suspicions,	9
but	9
not	9
knowing	9
well	9
what	9
it	9
was	9
I	9
suspected	9
or	9
fancied;	9
plain	9
omens	9
pointing	9
to	9
the	9
sad	9
event	9
and	9
misfortune	9
that	9
was	9
awaiting	9
me.	9
“I	9
reached	9
the	9
place	9
whither	9
I	9
had	9
been	9
sent,	9
gave	9
the	9
letter	9
to	9
Don	9
Fernando’s	9
brother,	9
and	9
was	9
kindly	9
received	9
but	9
not	9
promptly	9
dismissed,	9
for	9
he	9
desired	9
me	9
to	9
wait,	9
very	9
much	9
against	9
my	9
will,	9
eight	9
days	9
in	9
some	9
place	9
where	9
the	9
duke	9
his	9
father	9
was	9
not	9
likely	9
to	9
see	9
me,	9
as	9
his	9
brother	9
wrote	9
that	9
the	9
money	9
was	9
to	9
be	9
sent	9
without	9
his	9
knowledge;	9
all	9
of	9
which	9
was	9
a	9
scheme	9
of	9
the	9
treacherous	9
Don	9
Fernando,	9
for	9
his	9
brother	9
had	9
no	9
want	9
of	9
money	9
to	9
enable	9
him	9
to	9
despatch	9
me	9
at	9
once.	9
“The	9
command	9
was	9
one	9
that	9
exposed	9
me	9
to	9
the	9
temptation	9
of	9
disobeying	9
it,	9
as	9
it	9
seemed	9
to	9
me	9
impossible	9
to	9
endure	9
life	9
for	9
so	9
many	9
days	9
separated	9
from	9
Luscinda,	9
especially	9
after	9
leaving	9
her	9
in	9
the	9
sorrowful	9
mood	9
I	9
have	9
described	9
to	9
you;	9
nevertheless	9
as	9
a	9
dutiful	9
servant	9
I	9
obeyed,	9
though	9
I	9
felt	9
it	9
would	9
be	9
at	9
the	9
cost	9
of	9
my	9
well-being.	9
But	9
four	9
days	9
later	9
there	9
came	9
a	9
man	9
in	9
quest	9
of	9
me	9
with	9
a	9
letter	9
which	9
he	9
gave	9
me,	9
and	9
which	9
by	9
the	9
address	9
I	9
perceived	9
to	9
be	9
from	9
Luscinda,	9
as	9
the	9
writing	9
was	9
hers.	9
I	9
opened	9
it	9
with	9
fear	9
and	9
trepidation,	9
persuaded	9
that	9
it	9
must	9
be	9
something	9
serious	9
that	9
had	9
impelled	9
her	9
to	9
write	9
to	9
me	9
when	9
at	9
a	9
distance,	9
as	9
she	9
seldom	9
did	9
so	9
when	9
I	9
was	9
near.	9
Before	9
reading	9
it	9
I	9
asked	9
the	9
man	9
who	9
it	9
was	9
that	9
had	9
given	9
it	9
to	9
him,	9
and	9
how	9
long	9
he	9
had	9
been	9
upon	9
the	9
road;	9
he	9
told	9
me	9
that	9
as	9
he	9
happened	9
to	9
be	9
passing	9
through	9
one	9
of	9
the	9
streets	9
of	9
the	9
city	9
at	9
the	9
hour	9
of	9
noon,	9
a	9
very	9
beautiful	9
lady	9
called	9
to	9
him	9
from	9
a	9
window,	9
and	9
with	9
tears	9
in	9
her	9
eyes	9
said	9
to	9
him	9
hurriedly,	9
‘Brother,	9
if	9
you	9
are,	9
as	9
you	9
seem	9
to	9
be,	9
a	9
Christian,	9
for	9
the	9
love	9
of	9
God	9
I	9
entreat	9
you	9
to	9
have	9
this	9
letter	9
despatched	9
without	9
a	9
moment’s	9
delay	9
to	9
the	9
place	9
and	9
person	9
named	9
in	9
the	9
address,	9
all	9
which	9
is	9
well	9
known,	9
and	9
by	9
this	9
you	9
will	9
render	9
a	9
great	9
service	9
to	9
our	9
Lord;	9
and	9
that	9
you	9
may	9
be	9
at	9
no	9
inconvenience	9
in	9
doing	9
so	9
take	9
what	9
is	9
in	9
this	9
handkerchief;’	9
and	9
said	9
he,	9
‘with	9
this	9
she	9
threw	9
me	9
a	9
handkerchief	9
out	9
of	9
the	9
window	9
in	9
which	9
were	9
tied	9
up	9
a	9
hundred	9
reals	9
and	9
this	9
gold	9
ring	9
which	9
I	9
bring	9
here	9
together	9
with	9
the	9
letter	9
I	9
have	9
given	9
you.	9
And	9
then	9
without	9
waiting	9
for	9
any	9
answer	9
she	9
left	9
the	9
window,	9
though	9
not	9
before	9
she	9
saw	9
me	9
take	9
the	9
letter	9
and	9
the	9
handkerchief,	9
and	9
I	9
had	9
by	9
signs	9
let	9
her	9
know	9
that	9
I	9
would	9
do	9
as	9
she	9
bade	9
me;	9
and	9
so,	9
seeing	9
myself	9
so	9
well	9
paid	9
for	9
the	9
trouble	9
I	9
would	9
have	9
in	9
bringing	9
it	9
to	9
you,	9
and	9
knowing	9
by	9
the	9
address	9
that	9
it	9
was	9
to	9
you	9
it	9
was	9
sent	9
(for,	9
señor,	9
I	9
know	9
you	9
very	9
well),	9
and	9
also	9
unable	9
to	9
resist	9
that	9
beautiful	9
lady’s	9
tears,	9
I	9
resolved	9
to	9
trust	9
no	9
one	9
else,	9
but	9
to	9
come	9
myself	9
and	9
give	9
it	9
to	9
you,	9
and	9
in	9
sixteen	9
hours	9
from	9
the	9
time	9
when	9
it	9
was	9
given	9
me	9
I	9
have	9
made	9
the	9
journey,	9
which,	9
as	9
you	9
know,	9
is	9
eighteen	9
leagues.’	9
“All	9
the	9
while	9
the	9
good-natured	9
improvised	9
courier	9
was	9
telling	9
me	9
this,	9
I	9
hung	9
upon	9
his	9
words,	9
my	9
legs	9
trembling	9
under	9
me	9
so	9
that	9
I	9
could	9
scarcely	9
stand.	9
However,	9
I	9
opened	9
the	9
letter	9
and	9
read	9
these	9
words:	9
The	9
promise	9
Don	9
Fernando	9
gave	9
you	9
to	9
urge	9
your	9
father	9
to	9
speak	9
to	9
mine,	9
he	9
has	9
fulfilled	9
much	9
more	9
to	9
his	9
own	9
satisfaction	9
than	9
to	9
your	9
advantage.	9
I	9
have	9
to	9
tell	9
you,	9
señor,	9
that	9
he	9
has	9
demanded	9
me	9
for	9
a	9
wife,	9
and	9
my	9
father,	9
led	9
away	9
by	9
what	9
he	9
considers	9
Don	9
Fernando’s	9
superiority	9
over	9
you,	9
has	9
favoured	9
his	9
suit	9
so	9
cordially,	9
that	9
in	9
two	9
days	9
hence	9
the	9
betrothal	9
is	9
to	9
take	9
place	9
with	9
such	9
secrecy	9
and	9
so	9
privately	9
that	9
the	9
only	9
witnesses	9
are	9
to	9
be	9
the	9
Heavens	9
above	9
and	9
a	9
few	9
of	9
the	9
household.	9
Picture	9
to	9
yourself	9
the	9
state	9
I	9
am	9
in;	9
judge	9
if	9
it	9
be	9
urgent	9
for	9
you	9
to	9
come;	9
the	9
issue	9
of	9
the	9
affair	9
will	9
show	9
you	9
whether	9
I	9
love	9
you	9
or	9
not.	9
God	9
grant	9
this	9
may	9
come	9
to	9
your	9
hand	9
before	9
mine	9
shall	9
be	9
forced	9
to	9
link	9
itself	9
with	9
his	9
who	9
keeps	9
so	9
ill	9
the	9
faith	9
that	9
he	9
has	9
pledged.	9
“Such,	9
in	9
brief,	9
were	9
the	9
words	9
of	9
the	9
letter,	9
words	9
that	9
made	9
me	9
set	9
out	9
at	9
once	9
without	9
waiting	9
any	9
longer	9
for	9
reply	9
or	9
money;	9
for	9
I	9
now	9
saw	9
clearly	9
that	9
it	9
was	9
not	9
the	9
purchase	9
of	9
horses	9
but	9
of	9
his	9
own	9
pleasure	9
that	9
had	9
made	9
Don	9
Fernando	9
send	9
me	9
to	9
his	9
brother.	9
The	9
exasperation	9
I	9
felt	9
against	9
Don	9
Fernando,	9
joined	9
with	9
the	9
fear	9
of	9
losing	9
the	9
prize	9
I	9
had	9
won	9
by	9
so	9
many	9
years	9
of	9
love	9
and	9
devotion,	9
lent	9
me	9
wings;	9
so	9
that	9
almost	9
flying	9
I	9
reached	9
home	9
the	9
same	9
day,	9
by	9
the	9
hour	9
which	9
served	9
for	9
speaking	9
with	9
Luscinda.	9
I	9
arrived	9
unobserved,	9
and	9
left	9
the	9
mule	9
on	9
which	9
I	9
had	9
come	9
at	9
the	9
house	9
of	9
the	9
worthy	9
man	9
who	9
had	9
brought	9
me	9
the	9
letter,	9
and	9
fortune	9
was	9
pleased	9
to	9
be	9
for	9
once	9
so	9
kind	9
that	9
I	9
found	9
Luscinda	9
at	9
the	9
grating	9
that	9
was	9
the	9
witness	9
of	9
our	9
loves.	9
She	9
recognised	9
me	9
at	9
once,	9
and	9
I	9
her,	9
but	9
not	9
as	9
she	9
ought	9
to	9
have	9
recognised	9
me,	9
or	9
I	9
her.	9
But	9
who	9
is	9
there	9
in	9
the	9
world	9
that	9
can	9
boast	9
of	9
having	9
fathomed	9
or	9
understood	9
the	9
wavering	9
mind	9
and	9
unstable	9
nature	9
of	9
a	9
woman?	9
Of	9
a	9
truth	9
no	9
one.	9
To	9
proceed:	9
as	9
soon	9
as	9
Luscinda	9
saw	9
me	9
she	9
said,	9
‘Cardenio,	9
I	9
am	9
in	9
my	9
bridal	9
dress,	9
and	9
the	9
treacherous	9
Don	9
Fernando	9
and	9
my	9
covetous	9
father	9
are	9
waiting	9
for	9
me	9
in	9
the	9
hall	9
with	9
the	9
other	9
witnesses,	9
who	9
shall	9
be	9
the	9
witnesses	9
of	9
my	9
death	9
before	9
they	9
witness	9
my	9
betrothal.	9
Be	9
not	9
distressed,	9
my	9
friend,	9
but	9
contrive	9
to	9
be	9
present	9
at	9
this	9
sacrifice,	9
and	9
if	9
that	9
cannot	9
be	9
prevented	9
by	9
my	9
words,	9
I	9
have	9
a	9
dagger	9
concealed	9
which	9
will	9
prevent	9
more	9
deliberate	9
violence,	9
putting	9
an	9
end	9
to	9
my	9
life	9
and	9
giving	9
thee	9
a	9
first	9
proof	9
of	9
the	9
love	9
I	9
have	9
borne	9
and	9
bear	9
thee.’	9
I	9
replied	9
to	9
her	9
distractedly	9
and	9
hastily,	9
in	9
fear	9
lest	9
I	9
should	9
not	9
have	9
time	9
to	9
reply,	9
‘May	9
thy	9
words	9
be	9
verified	9
by	9
thy	9
deeds,	9
lady;	9
and	9
if	9
thou	9
hast	9
a	9
dagger	9
to	9
save	9
thy	9
honour,	9
I	9
have	9
a	9
sword	9
to	9
defend	9
thee	9
or	9
kill	9
myself	9
if	9
fortune	9
be	9
against	9
us.’	9
“I	9
think	9
she	9
could	9
not	9
have	9
heard	9
all	9
these	9
words,	9
for	9
I	9
perceived	9
that	9
they	9
called	9
her	9
away	9
in	9
haste,	9
as	9
the	9
bridegroom	9
was	9
waiting.	9
Now	9
the	9
night	9
of	9
my	9
sorrow	9
set	9
in,	9
the	9
sun	9
of	9
my	9
happiness	9
went	9
down,	9
I	9
felt	9
my	9
eyes	9
bereft	9
of	9
sight,	9
my	9
mind	9
of	9
reason.	9
I	9
could	9
not	9
enter	9
the	9
house,	9
nor	9
was	9
I	9
capable	9
of	9
any	9
movement;	9
but	9
reflecting	9
how	9
important	9
it	9
was	9
that	9
I	9
should	9
be	9
present	9
at	9
what	9
might	9
take	9
place	9
on	9
the	9
occasion,	9
I	9
nerved	9
myself	9
as	9
best	9
I	9
could	9
and	9
went	9
in,	9
for	9
I	9
well	9
knew	9
all	9
the	9
entrances	9
and	9
outlets;	9
and	9
besides,	9
with	9
the	9
confusion	9
that	9
in	9
secret	9
pervaded	9
the	9
house	9
no	9
one	9
took	9
notice	9
of	9
me,	9
so,	9
without	9
being	9
seen,	9
I	9
found	9
an	9
opportunity	9
of	9
placing	9
myself	9
in	9
the	9
recess	9
formed	9
by	9
a	9
window	9
of	9
the	9
hall	9
itself,	9
and	9
concealed	9
by	9
the	9
ends	9
and	9
borders	9
of	9
two	9
tapestries,	9
from	9
between	9
which	9
I	9
could,	9
without	9
being	9
seen,	9
see	9
all	9
that	9
took	9
place	9
in	9
the	9
room.	9
Who	9
could	9
describe	9
the	9
agitation	9
of	9
heart	9
I	9
suffered	9
as	9
I	9
stood	9
there—the	9
thoughts	9
that	9
came	9
to	9
me—the	9
reflections	9
that	9
passed	9
through	9
my	9
mind?	9
They	9
were	9
such	9
as	9
cannot	9
be,	9
nor	9
were	9
it	9
well	9
they	9
should	9
be,	9
told.	9
Suffice	9
it	9
to	9
say	9
that	9
the	9
bridegroom	9
entered	9
the	9
hall	9
in	9
his	9
usual	9
dress,	9
without	9
ornament	9
of	9
any	9
kind;	9
as	9
groomsman	9
he	9
had	9
with	9
him	9
a	9
cousin	9
of	9
Luscinda’s	9
and	9
except	9
the	9
servants	9
of	9
the	9
house	9
there	9
was	9
no	9
one	9
else	9
in	9
the	9
chamber.	9
Soon	9
afterwards	9
Luscinda	9
came	9
out	9
from	9
an	9
antechamber,	9
attended	9
by	9
her	9
mother	9
and	9
two	9
of	9
her	9
damsels,	9
arrayed	9
and	9
adorned	9
as	9
became	9
her	9
rank	9
and	9
beauty,	9
and	9
in	9
full	9
festival	9
and	9
ceremonial	9
attire.	9
My	9
anxiety	9
and	9
distraction	9
did	9
not	9
allow	9
me	9
to	9
observe	9
or	9
notice	9
particularly	9
what	9
she	9
wore;	9
I	9
could	9
only	9
perceive	9
the	9
colours,	9
which	9
were	9
crimson	9
and	9
white,	9
and	9
the	9
glitter	9
of	9
the	9
gems	9
and	9
jewels	9
on	9
her	9
head	9
dress	9
and	9
apparel,	9
surpassed	9
by	9
the	9
rare	9
beauty	9
of	9
her	9
lovely	9
auburn	9
hair	9
that	9
vying	9
with	9
the	9
precious	9
stones	9
and	9
the	9
light	9
of	9
the	9
four	9
torches	9
that	9
stood	9
in	9
the	9
hall	9
shone	9
with	9
a	9
brighter	9
gleam	9
than	9
all.	9
Oh	9
memory,	9
mortal	9
foe	9
of	9
my	9
peace!	9
why	9
bring	9
before	9
me	9
now	9
the	9
incomparable	9
beauty	9
of	9
that	9
adored	9
enemy	9
of	9
mine?	9
Were	9
it	9
not	9
better,	9
cruel	9
memory,	9
to	9
remind	9
me	9
and	9
recall	9
what	9
she	9
then	9
did,	9
that	9
stirred	9
by	9
a	9
wrong	9
so	9
glaring	9
I	9
may	9
seek,	9
if	9
not	9
vengeance	9
now,	9
at	9
least	9
to	9
rid	9
myself	9
of	9
life?	9
Be	9
not	9
weary,	9
sirs,	9
of	9
listening	9
to	9
these	9
digressions;	9
my	9
sorrow	9
is	9
not	9
one	9
of	9
those	9
that	9
can	9
or	9
should	9
be	9
told	9
tersely	9
and	9
briefly,	9
for	9
to	9
me	9
each	9
incident	9
seems	9
to	9
call	9
for	9
many	9
words.”	9
To	9
this	9
the	9
curate	9
replied	9
that	9
not	9
only	9
were	9
they	9
not	9
weary	9
of	9
listening	9
to	9
him,	9
but	9
that	9
the	9
details	9
he	9
mentioned	9
interested	9
them	9
greatly,	9
being	9
of	9
a	9
kind	9
by	9
no	9
means	9
to	9
be	9
omitted	9
and	9
deserving	9
of	9
the	9
same	9
attention	9
as	9
the	9
main	9
story.	9
“To	9
proceed,	9
then,”	9
continued	9
Cardenio:	9
“all	9
being	9
assembled	9
in	9
the	9
hall,	9
the	9
priest	9
of	9
the	9
parish	9
came	9
in	9
and	9
as	9
he	9
took	9
the	9
pair	9
by	9
the	9
hand	9
to	9
perform	9
the	9
requisite	9
ceremony,	9
at	9
the	9
words,	9
‘Will	9
you,	9
Señora	9
Luscinda,	9
take	9
Señor	9
Don	9
Fernando,	9
here	9
present,	9
for	9
your	9
lawful	9
husband,	9
as	9
the	9
holy	9
Mother	9
Church	9
ordains?’	9
I	9
thrust	9
my	9
head	9
and	9
neck	9
out	9
from	9
between	9
the	9
tapestries,	9
and	9
with	9
eager	9
ears	9
and	9
throbbing	9
heart	9
set	9
myself	9
to	9
listen	9
to	9
Luscinda’s	9
answer,	9
awaiting	9
in	9
her	9
reply	9
the	9
sentence	9
of	9
death	9
or	9
the	9
grant	9
of	9
life.	9
Oh,	9
that	9
I	9
had	9
but	9
dared	9
at	9
that	9
moment	9
to	9
rush	9
forward	9
crying	9
aloud,	9
‘Luscinda,	9
Luscinda!	9
have	9
a	9
care	9
what	9
thou	9
dost;	9
remember	9
what	9
thou	9
owest	9
me;	9
bethink	9
thee	9
thou	9
art	9
mine	9
and	9
canst	9
not	9
be	9
another’s;	9
reflect	9
that	9
thy	9
utterance	9
of	9
“Yes”	9
and	9
the	9
end	9
of	9
my	9
life	9
will	9
come	9
at	9
the	9
same	9
instant.	9
O,	9
treacherous	9
Don	9
Fernando!	9
robber	9
of	9
my	9
glory,	9
death	9
of	9
my	9
life!	9
What	9
seekest	9
thou?	9
Remember	9
that	9
thou	9
canst	9
not	9
as	9
a	9
Christian	9
attain	9
the	9
object	9
of	9
thy	9
wishes,	9
for	9
Luscinda	9
is	9
my	9
bride,	9
and	9
I	9
am	9
her	9
husband!’	9
Fool	9
that	9
I	9
am!	9
now	9
that	9
I	9
am	9
far	9
away,	9
and	9
out	9
of	9
danger,	9
I	9
say	9
I	9
should	9
have	9
done	9
what	9
I	9
did	9
not	9
do:	9
now	9
that	9
I	9
have	9
allowed	9
my	9
precious	9
treasure	9
to	9
be	9
robbed	9
from	9
me,	9
I	9
curse	9
the	9
robber,	9
on	9
whom	9
I	9
might	9
have	9
taken	9
vengeance	9
had	9
I	9
as	9
much	9
heart	9
for	9
it	9
as	9
I	9
have	9
for	9
bewailing	9
my	9
fate;	9
in	9
short,	9
as	9
I	9
was	9
then	9
a	9
coward	9
and	9
a	9
fool,	9
little	9
wonder	9
is	9
it	9
if	9
I	9
am	9
now	9
dying	9
shame-stricken,	9
remorseful,	9
and	9
mad.	9
“The	9
priest	9
stood	9
waiting	9
for	9
the	9
answer	9
of	9
Luscinda,	9
who	9
for	9
a	9
long	9
time	9
withheld	9
it;	9
and	9
just	9
as	9
I	9
thought	9
she	9
was	9
taking	9
out	9
the	9
dagger	9
to	9
save	9
her	9
honour,	9
or	9
struggling	9
for	9
words	9
to	9
make	9
some	9
declaration	9
of	9
the	9
truth	9
on	9
my	9
behalf,	9
I	9
heard	9
her	9
say	9
in	9
a	9
faint	9
and	9
feeble	9
voice,	9
‘I	9
will:’	9
Don	9
Fernando	9
said	9
the	9
same,	9
and	9
giving	9
her	9
the	9
ring	9
they	9
stood	9
linked	9
by	9
a	9
knot	9
that	9
could	9
never	9
be	9
loosed.	9
The	9
bridegroom	9
then	9
approached	9
to	9
embrace	9
his	9
bride;	9
and	9
she,	9
pressing	9
her	9
hand	9
upon	9
her	9
heart,	9
fell	9
fainting	9
in	9
her	9
mother’s	9
arms.	9
It	9
only	9
remains	9
now	9
for	9
me	9
to	9
tell	9
you	9
the	9
state	9
I	9
was	9
in	9
when	9
in	9
that	9
consent	9
that	9
I	9
heard	9
I	9
saw	9
all	9
my	9
hopes	9
mocked,	9
the	9
words	9
and	9
promises	9
of	9
Luscinda	9
proved	9
falsehoods,	9
and	9
the	9
recovery	9
of	9
the	9
prize	9
I	9
had	9
that	9
instant	9
lost	9
rendered	9
impossible	9
for	9
ever.	9
I	9
stood	9
stupefied,	9
wholly	9
abandoned,	9
it	9
seemed,	9
by	9
Heaven,	9
declared	9
the	9
enemy	9
of	9
the	9
earth	9
that	9
bore	9
me,	9
the	9
air	9
refusing	9
me	9
breath	9
for	9
my	9
sighs,	9
the	9
water	9
moisture	9
for	9
my	9
tears;	9
it	9
was	9
only	9
the	9
fire	9
that	9
gathered	9
strength	9
so	9
that	9
my	9
whole	9
frame	9
glowed	9
with	9
rage	9
and	9
jealousy.	9
They	9
were	9
all	9
thrown	9
into	9
confusion	9
by	9
Luscinda’s	9
fainting,	9
and	9
as	9
her	9
mother	9
was	9
unlacing	9
her	9
to	9
give	9
her	9
air	9
a	9
sealed	9
paper	9
was	9
discovered	9
in	9
her	9
bosom	9
which	9
Don	9
Fernando	9
seized	9
at	9
once	9
and	9
began	9
to	9
read	9
by	9
the	9
light	9
of	9
one	9
of	9
the	9
torches.	9
As	9
soon	9
as	9
he	9
had	9
read	9
it	9
he	9
seated	9
himself	9
in	9
a	9
chair,	9
leaning	9
his	9
cheek	9
on	9
his	9
hand	9
in	9
the	9
attitude	9
of	9
one	9
deep	9
in	9
thought,	9
without	9
taking	9
any	9
part	9
in	9
the	9
efforts	9
that	9
were	9
being	9
made	9
to	9
recover	9
his	9
bride	9
from	9
her	9
fainting	9
fit.	9
“Seeing	9
all	9
the	9
household	9
in	9
confusion,	9
I	9
ventured	9
to	9
come	9
out	9
regardless	9
whether	9
I	9
were	9
seen	9
or	9
not,	9
and	9
determined,	9
if	9
I	9
were,	9
to	9
do	9
some	9
frenzied	9
deed	9
that	9
would	9
prove	9
to	9
all	9
the	9
world	9
the	9
righteous	9
indignation	9
of	9
my	9
breast	9
in	9
the	9
punishment	9
of	9
the	9
treacherous	9
Don	9
Fernando,	9
and	9
even	9
in	9
that	9
of	9
the	9
fickle	9
fainting	9
traitress.	9
But	9
my	9
fate,	9
doubtless	9
reserving	9
me	9
for	9
greater	9
sorrows,	9
if	9
such	9
there	9
be,	9
so	9
ordered	9
it	9
that	9
just	9
then	9
I	9
had	9
enough	9
and	9
to	9
spare	9
of	9
that	9
reason	9
which	9
has	9
since	9
been	9
wanting	9
to	9
me;	9
and	9
so,	9
without	9
seeking	9
to	9
take	9
vengeance	9
on	9
my	9
greatest	9
enemies	9
(which	9
might	9
have	9
been	9
easily	9
taken,	9
as	9
all	9
thought	9
of	9
me	9
was	9
so	9
far	9
from	9
their	9
minds),	9
I	9
resolved	9
to	9
take	9
it	9
upon	9
myself,	9
and	9
on	9
myself	9
to	9
inflict	9
the	9
pain	9
they	9
deserved,	9
perhaps	9
with	9
even	9
greater	9
severity	9
than	9
I	9
should	9
have	9
dealt	9
out	9
to	9
them	9
had	9
I	9
then	9
slain	9
them;	9
for	9
sudden	9
pain	9
is	9
soon	9
over,	9
but	9
that	9
which	9
is	9
protracted	9
by	9
tortures	9
is	9
ever	9
slaying	9
without	9
ending	9
life.	9
In	9
a	9
word,	9
I	9
quitted	9
the	9
house	9
and	9
reached	9
that	9
of	9
the	9
man	9
with	9
whom	9
I	9
had	9
left	9
my	9
mule;	9
I	9
made	9
him	9
saddle	9
it	9
for	9
me,	9
mounted	9
without	9
bidding	9
him	9
farewell,	9
and	9
rode	9
out	9
of	9
the	9
city,	9
like	9
another	9
Lot,	9
not	9
daring	9
to	9
turn	9
my	9
head	9
to	9
look	9
back	9
upon	9
it;	9
and	9
when	9
I	9
found	9
myself	9
alone	9
in	9
the	9
open	9
country,	9
screened	9
by	9
the	9
darkness	9
of	9
the	9
night,	9
and	9
tempted	9
by	9
the	9
stillness	9
to	9
give	9
vent	9
to	9
my	9
grief	9
without	9
apprehension	9
or	9
fear	9
of	9
being	9
heard	9
or	9
seen,	9
then	9
I	9
broke	9
silence	9
and	9
lifted	9
up	9
my	9
voice	9
in	9
maledictions	9
upon	9
Luscinda	9
and	9
Don	9
Fernando,	9
as	9
if	9
I	9
could	9
thus	9
avenge	9
the	9
wrong	9
they	9
had	9
done	9
me.	9
I	9
called	9
her	9
cruel,	9
ungrateful,	9
false,	9
thankless,	9
but	9
above	9
all	9
covetous,	9
since	9
the	9
wealth	9
of	9
my	9
enemy	9
had	9
blinded	9
the	9
eyes	9
of	9
her	9
affection,	9
and	9
turned	9
it	9
from	9
me	9
to	9
transfer	9
it	9
to	9
one	9
to	9
whom	9
fortune	9
had	9
been	9
more	9
generous	9
and	9
liberal.	9
And	9
yet,	9
in	9
the	9
midst	9
of	9
this	9
outburst	9
of	9
execration	9
and	9
upbraiding,	9
I	9
found	9
excuses	9
for	9
her,	9
saying	9
it	9
was	9
no	9
wonder	9
that	9
a	9
young	9
girl	9
in	9
the	9
seclusion	9
of	9
her	9
parents’	9
house,	9
trained	9
and	9
schooled	9
to	9
obey	9
them	9
always,	9
should	9
have	9
been	9
ready	9
to	9
yield	9
to	9
their	9
wishes	9
when	9
they	9
offered	9
her	9
for	9
a	9
husband	9
a	9
gentleman	9
of	9
such	9
distinction,	9
wealth,	9
and	9
noble	9
birth,	9
that	9
if	9
she	9
had	9
refused	9
to	9
accept	9
him	9
she	9
would	9
have	9
been	9
thought	9
out	9
of	9
her	9
senses,	9
or	9
to	9
have	9
set	9
her	9
affection	9
elsewhere,	9
a	9
suspicion	9
injurious	9
to	9
her	9
fair	9
name	9
and	9
fame.	9
But	9
then	9
again,	9
I	9
said,	9
had	9
she	9
declared	9
I	9
was	9
her	9
husband,	9
they	9
would	9
have	9
seen	9
that	9
in	9
choosing	9
me	9
she	9
had	9
not	9
chosen	9
so	9
ill	9
but	9
that	9
they	9
might	9
excuse	9
her,	9
for	9
before	9
Don	9
Fernando	9
had	9
made	9
his	9
offer,	9
they	9
themselves	9
could	9
not	9
have	9
desired,	9
if	9
their	9
desires	9
had	9
been	9
ruled	9
by	9
reason,	9
a	9
more	9
eligible	9
husband	9
for	9
their	9
daughter	9
than	9
I	9
was;	9
and	9
she,	9
before	9
taking	9
the	9
last	9
fatal	9
step	9
of	9
giving	9
her	9
hand,	9
might	9
easily	9
have	9
said	9
that	9
I	9
had	9
already	9
given	9
her	9
mine,	9
for	9
I	9
should	9
have	9
come	9
forward	9
to	9
support	9
any	9
assertion	9
of	9
hers	9
to	9
that	9
effect.	9
In	9
short,	9
I	9
came	9
to	9
the	9
conclusion	9
that	9
feeble	9
love,	9
little	9
reflection,	9
great	9
ambition,	9
and	9
a	9
craving	9
for	9
rank,	9
had	9
made	9
her	9
forget	9
the	9
words	9
with	9
which	9
she	9
had	9
deceived	9
me,	9
encouraged	9
and	9
supported	9
by	9
my	9
firm	9
hopes	9
and	9
honourable	9
passion.	9
“Thus	9
soliloquising	9
and	9
agitated,	9
I	9
journeyed	9
onward	9
for	9
the	9
remainder	9
of	9
the	9
night,	9
and	9
by	9
daybreak	9
I	9
reached	9
one	9
of	9
the	9
passes	9
of	9
these	9
mountains,	9
among	9
which	9
I	9
wandered	9
for	9
three	9
days	9
more	9
without	9
taking	9
any	9
path	9
or	9
road,	9
until	9
I	9
came	9
to	9
some	9
meadows	9
lying	9
on	9
I	9
know	9
not	9
which	9
side	9
of	9
the	9
mountains,	9
and	9
there	9
I	9
inquired	9
of	9
some	9
herdsmen	9
in	9
what	9
direction	9
the	9
most	9
rugged	9
part	9
of	9
the	9
range	9
lay.	9
They	9
told	9
me	9
that	9
it	9
was	9
in	9
this	9
quarter,	9
and	9
I	9
at	9
once	9
directed	9
my	9
course	9
hither,	9
intending	9
to	9
end	9
my	9
life	9
here;	9
but	9
as	9
I	9
was	9
making	9
my	9
way	9
among	9
these	9
crags,	9
my	9
mule	9
dropped	9
dead	9
through	9
fatigue	9
and	9
hunger,	9
or,	9
as	9
I	9
think	9
more	9
likely,	9
in	9
order	9
to	9
have	9
done	9
with	9
such	9
a	9
worthless	9
burden	9
as	9
it	9
bore	9
in	9
me.	9
I	9
was	9
left	9
on	9
foot,	9
worn	9
out,	9
famishing,	9
without	9
anyone	9
to	9
help	9
me	9
or	9
any	9
thought	9
of	9
seeking	9
help:	9
and	9
so	9
thus	9
I	9
lay	9
stretched	9
on	9
the	9
ground,	9
how	9
long	9
I	9
know	9
not,	9
after	9
which	9
I	9
rose	9
up	9
free	9
from	9
hunger,	9
and	9
found	9
beside	9
me	9
some	9
goatherds,	9
who	9
no	9
doubt	9
were	9
the	9
persons	9
who	9
had	9
relieved	9
me	9
in	9
my	9
need,	9
for	9
they	9
told	9
me	9
how	9
they	9
had	9
found	9
me,	9
and	9
how	9
I	9
had	9
been	9
uttering	9
ravings	9
that	9
showed	9
plainly	9
I	9
had	9
lost	9
my	9
reason;	9
and	9
since	9
then	9
I	9
am	9
conscious	9
that	9
I	9
am	9
not	9
always	9
in	9
full	9
possession	9
of	9
it,	9
but	9
at	9
times	9
so	9
deranged	9
and	9
crazed	9
that	9
I	9
do	9
a	9
thousand	9
mad	9
things,	9
tearing	9
my	9
clothes,	9
crying	9
aloud	9
in	9
these	9
solitudes,	9
cursing	9
my	9
fate,	9
and	9
idly	9
calling	9
on	9
the	9
dear	9
name	9
of	9
her	9
who	9
is	9
my	9
enemy,	9
and	9
only	9
seeking	9
to	9
end	9
my	9
life	9
in	9
lamentation;	9
and	9
when	9
I	9
recover	9
my	9
senses	9
I	9
find	9
myself	9
so	9
exhausted	9
and	9
weary	9
that	9
I	9
can	9
scarcely	9
move.	9
Most	9
commonly	9
my	9
dwelling	9
is	9
the	9
hollow	9
of	9
a	9
cork	9
tree	9
large	9
enough	9
to	9
shelter	9
this	9
miserable	9
body;	9
the	9
herdsmen	9
and	9
goatherds	9
who	9
frequent	9
these	9
mountains,	9
moved	9
by	9
compassion,	9
furnish	9
me	9
with	9
food,	9
leaving	9
it	9
by	9
the	9
wayside	9
or	9
on	9
the	9
rocks,	9
where	9
they	9
think	9
I	9
may	9
perhaps	9
pass	9
and	9
find	9
it;	9
and	9
so,	9
even	9
though	9
I	9
may	9
be	9
then	9
out	9
of	9
my	9
senses,	9
the	9
wants	9
of	9
nature	9
teach	9
me	9
what	9
is	9
required	9
to	9
sustain	9
me,	9
and	9
make	9
me	9
crave	9
it	9
and	9
eager	9
to	9
take	9
it.	9
At	9
other	9
times,	9
so	9
they	9
tell	9
me	9
when	9
they	9
find	9
me	9
in	9
a	9
rational	9
mood,	9
I	9
sally	9
out	9
upon	9
the	9
road,	9
and	9
though	9
they	9
would	9
gladly	9
give	9
it	9
me,	9
I	9
snatch	9
food	9
by	9
force	9
from	9
the	9
shepherds	9
bringing	9
it	9
from	9
the	9
village	9
to	9
their	9
huts.	9
Thus	9
do	9
pass	9
the	9
wretched	9
life	9
that	9
remains	9
to	9
me,	9
until	9
it	9
be	9
Heaven’s	9
will	9
to	9
bring	9
it	9
to	9
a	9
close,	9
or	9
so	9
to	9
order	9
my	9
memory	9
that	9
I	9
no	9
longer	9
recollect	9
the	9
beauty	9
and	9
treachery	9
of	9
Luscinda,	9
or	9
the	9
wrong	9
done	9
me	9
by	9
Don	9
Fernando;	9
for	9
if	9
it	9
will	9
do	9
this	9
without	9
depriving	9
me	9
of	9
life,	9
I	9
will	9
turn	9
my	9
thoughts	9
into	9
some	9
better	9
channel;	9
if	9
not,	9
I	9
can	9
only	9
implore	9
it	9
to	9
have	9
full	9
mercy	9
on	9
my	9
soul,	9
for	9
in	9
myself	9
I	9
feel	9
no	9
power	9
or	9
strength	9
to	9
release	9
my	9
body	9
from	9
this	9
strait	9
in	9
which	9
I	9
have	9
of	9
my	9
own	9
accord	9
chosen	9
to	9
place	9
it.	9
“Such,	9
sirs,	9
is	9
the	9
dismal	9
story	9
of	9
my	9
misfortune:	9
say	9
if	9
it	9
be	9
one	9
that	9
can	9
be	9
told	9
with	9
less	9
emotion	9
than	9
you	9
have	9
seen	9
in	9
me;	9
and	9
do	9
not	9
trouble	9
yourselves	9
with	9
urging	9
or	9
pressing	9
upon	9
me	9
what	9
reason	9
suggests	9
as	9
likely	9
to	9
serve	9
for	9
my	9
relief,	9
for	9
it	9
will	9
avail	9
me	9
as	9
much	9
as	9
the	9
medicine	9
prescribed	9
by	9
a	9
wise	9
physician	9
avails	9
the	9
sick	9
man	9
who	9
will	9
not	9
take	9
it.	9
I	9
have	9
no	9
wish	9
for	9
health	9
without	9
Luscinda;	9
and	9
since	9
it	9
is	9
her	9
pleasure	9
to	9
be	9
another’s,	9
when	9
she	9
is	9
or	9
should	9
be	9
mine,	9
let	9
it	9
be	9
mine	9
to	9
be	9
a	9
prey	9
to	9
misery	9
when	9
I	9
might	9
have	9
enjoyed	9
happiness.	9
She	9
by	9
her	9
fickleness	9
strove	9
to	9
make	9
my	9
ruin	9
irretrievable;	9
I	9
will	9
strive	9
to	9
gratify	9
her	9
wishes	9
by	9
seeking	9
destruction;	9
and	9
it	9
will	9
show	9
generations	9
to	9
come	9
that	9
I	9
alone	9
was	9
deprived	9
of	9
that	9
of	9
which	9
all	9
others	9
in	9
misfortune	9
have	9
a	9
superabundance,	9
for	9
to	9
them	9
the	9
impossibility	9
of	9
being	9
consoled	9
is	9
itself	9
a	9
consolation,	9
while	9
to	9
me	9
it	9
is	9
the	9
cause	9
of	9
greater	9
sorrows	9
and	9
sufferings,	9
for	9
I	9
think	9
that	9
even	9
in	9
death	9
there	9
will	9
not	9
be	9
an	9
end	9
of	9
them.”	9
Here	9
Cardenio	9
brought	9
to	9
a	9
close	9
his	9
long	9
discourse	9
and	9
story,	9
as	9
full	9
of	9
misfortune	9
as	9
it	9
was	9
of	9
love;	9
but	9
just	9
as	9
the	9
curate	9
was	9
going	9
to	9
address	9
some	9
words	9
of	9
comfort	9
to	9
him,	9
he	9
was	9
stopped	9
by	9
a	9
voice	9
that	9
reached	9
his	9
ear,	9
saying	9
in	9
melancholy	9
tones	9
what	9
will	9
be	9
told	9
in	9
the	9
Fourth	9
Part	9
of	9
this	9
narrative;	9
for	9
at	9
this	9
point	9
the	9
sage	9
and	9
sagacious	9
historian,	9
Cid	9
Hamete	9
Benengeli,	9
brought	9
the	9
Third	9
to	9
a	9
conclusion.	9

that	9
most	9
daring	9
knight	9
Don	9

sent	9
into	9
the	9

the	9

not	9

the	9

also	9

which	9
are,	9
in	9

no	9

pleasing,	9
ingenious,	9
and	9
truthful,	9
than	9
the	9
history	9
itself;	9
which,	9
resuming	9
its	9
thread,	9
carded,	9
spun,	9
and	9
wound,	9
relates	9
that	9
just	9
as	9
the	9
curate	9
was	9
going	9
to	9
offer	9
consolation	9
to	9
Cardenio,	9
he	9
was	9
interrupted	9
by	9
a	9
voice	9
that	9
fell	9
upon	9
his	9
ear	9
saying	9
in	9
plaintive	9
tones:	9
“O	9
God!	9
is	9
it	9
possible	9
I	9
have	9
found	9
a	9
place	9
that	9
may	9
serve	9
as	9
a	9
secret	9
grave	9
for	9
the	9
weary	9
load	9
of	9
this	9
body	9
that	9
I	9
support	9
so	9
unwillingly?	9
If	9
the	9
solitude	9
these	9
mountains	9
promise	9
deceives	9
me	9
not,	9
it	9
is	9
so;	9
ah!	9
woe	9
is	9
me!	9
how	9
much	9
more	9
grateful	9
to	9
my	9
mind	9
will	9
be	9
the	9
society	9
of	9
these	9
rocks	9
and	9
brakes	9
that	9
permit	9
me	9
to	9
complain	9
of	9
my	9
misfortune	9
to	9
Heaven,	9
than	9
that	9
of	9
any	9
human	9
being,	9
for	9
there	9
is	9
none	9
on	9
earth	9
to	9
look	9
to	9
for	9
counsel	9
in	9
doubt,	9
comfort	9
in	9
sorrow,	9
or	9
relief	9
in	9
distress!”	9
All	9
this	9
was	9
heard	9
distinctly	9
by	9
the	9
curate	9
and	9
those	9
with	9
him,	9
and	9
as	9
it	9
seemed	9
to	9
them	9
to	9
be	9
uttered	9
close	9
by,	9
as	9
indeed	9
it	9
was,	9
they	9
got	9
up	9
to	9
look	9
for	9
the	9
speaker,	9
and	9
before	9
they	9
had	9
gone	9
twenty	9
paces	9
they	9
discovered	9
behind	9
a	9
rock,	9
seated	9
at	9
the	9
foot	9
of	9
an	9
ash	9
tree,	9
a	9
youth	9
in	9
the	9
dress	9
of	9
a	9
peasant,	9
whose	9
face	9
they	9
were	9
unable	9
at	9
the	9
moment	9
to	9
see	9
as	9
he	9
was	9
leaning	9
forward,	9
bathing	9
his	9
feet	9
in	9
the	9
brook	9
that	9
flowed	9
past.	9
They	9
approached	9
so	9
silently	9
that	9
he	9
did	9
not	9
perceive	9
them,	9
being	9
fully	9
occupied	9
in	9
bathing	9
his	9
feet,	9
which	9
were	9
so	9
fair	9
that	9
they	9
looked	9
like	9
two	9
pieces	9
of	9
shining	9
crystal	9
brought	9
forth	9
among	9
the	9
other	9
stones	9
of	9
the	9
brook.	9
The	9
whiteness	9
and	9
beauty	9
of	9
these	9
feet	9
struck	9
them	9
with	9
surprise,	9
for	9
they	9
did	9
not	9
seem	9
to	9
have	9
been	9
made	9
to	9
crush	9
clods	9
or	9
to	9
follow	9
the	9
plough	9
and	9
the	9
oxen	9
as	9
their	9
owner’s	9
dress	9
suggested;	9
and	9
so,	9
finding	9
they	9
had	9
not	9
been	9
noticed,	9
the	9
curate,	9
who	9
was	9
in	9
front,	9
made	9
a	9
sign	9
to	9
the	9
other	9
two	9
to	9
conceal	9
themselves	9
behind	9
some	9
fragments	9
of	9
rock	9
that	9
lay	9
there;	9
which	9
they	9
did,	9
observing	9
closely	9
what	9
the	9
youth	9
was	9
about.	9
He	9
had	9
on	9
a	9
loose	9
double-skirted	9
dark	9
brown	9
jacket	9
bound	9
tight	9
to	9
his	9
body	9
with	9
a	9
white	9
cloth;	9
he	9
wore	9
besides	9
breeches	9
and	9
gaiters	9
of	9
brown	9
cloth,	9
and	9
on	9
his	9
head	9
a	9
brown	9
montera;	9
and	9
he	9
had	9
the	9
gaiters	9
turned	9
up	9
as	9
far	9
as	9
the	9
middle	9
of	9
the	9
leg,	9
which	9
verily	9
seemed	9
to	9
be	9
of	9
pure	9
alabaster.	9

As	9
soon	9
as	9
he	9
had	9
done	9
bathing	9
his	9
beautiful	9
feet,	9
he	9
wiped	9
them	9
with	9
a	9
towel	9
he	9
took	9
from	9
under	9
the	9
montera,	9
on	9
taking	9
off	9
which	9
he	9
raised	9
his	9
face,	9
and	9
those	9
who	9
were	9
watching	9
him	9
had	9
an	9
opportunity	9
of	9
seeing	9
a	9
beauty	9
so	9
exquisite	9
that	9
Cardenio	9
said	9
to	9
the	9
curate	9
in	9
a	9
whisper:	9
“As	9
this	9
is	9
not	9
Luscinda,	9
it	9
is	9
no	9
human	9
creature	9
but	9
a	9
divine	9
being.”	9
The	9
youth	9
then	9
took	9
off	9
the	9
montera,	9
and	9
shaking	9
his	9
head	9
from	9
side	9
to	9
side	9
there	9
broke	9
loose	9
and	9
spread	9
out	9
a	9
mass	9
of	9
hair	9
that	9
the	9
beams	9
of	9
the	9
sun	9
might	9
have	9
envied;	9
by	9
this	9
they	9
knew	9
that	9
what	9
had	9
seemed	9
a	9
peasant	9
was	9
a	9
lovely	9
woman,	9
nay	9
the	9
most	9
beautiful	9
the	9
eyes	9
of	9
two	9
of	9
them	9
had	9
ever	9
beheld,	9
or	9
even	9
Cardenio’s	9
if	9
they	9
had	9
not	9
seen	9
and	9
known	9
Luscinda,	9
for	9
he	9
afterwards	9
declared	9
that	9
only	9
the	9
beauty	9
of	9
Luscinda	9
could	9
compare	9
with	9
this.	9
The	9
long	9
auburn	9
tresses	9
not	9
only	9
covered	9
her	9
shoulders,	9
but	9
such	9
was	9
their	9
length	9
and	9
abundance,	9
concealed	9
her	9
all	9
round	9
beneath	9
their	9
masses,	9
so	9
that	9
except	9
the	9
feet	9
nothing	9
of	9
her	9
form	9
was	9
visible.	9
She	9
now	9
used	9
her	9
hands	9
as	9
a	9
comb,	9
and	9
if	9
her	9
feet	9
had	9
seemed	9
like	9
bits	9
of	9
crystal	9
in	9
the	9
water,	9
her	9
hands	9
looked	9
like	9
pieces	9
of	9
driven	9
snow	9
among	9
her	9
locks;	9
all	9
which	9
increased	9
not	9
only	9
the	9
admiration	9
of	9
the	9
three	9
beholders,	9
but	9
their	9
anxiety	9
to	9
learn	9
who	9
she	9
was.	9
With	9
this	9
object	9
they	9
resolved	9
to	9
show	9
themselves,	9
and	9
at	9
the	9
stir	9
they	9
made	9
in	9
getting	9
upon	9
their	9
feet	9
the	9
fair	9
damsel	9
raised	9
her	9
head,	9
and	9
parting	9
her	9
hair	9
from	9
before	9
her	9
eyes	9
with	9
both	9
hands,	9
she	9
looked	9
to	9
see	9
who	9
had	9
made	9
the	9
noise,	9
and	9
the	9
instant	9
she	9
perceived	9
them	9
she	9
started	9
to	9
her	9
feet,	9
and	9
without	9
waiting	9
to	9
put	9
on	9
her	9
shoes	9
or	9
gather	9
up	9
her	9
hair,	9
hastily	9
snatched	9
up	9
a	9
bundle	9
as	9
though	9
of	9
clothes	9
that	9
she	9
had	9
beside	9
her,	9
and,	9
scared	9
and	9
alarmed,	9
endeavoured	9
to	9
take	9
flight;	9
but	9
before	9
she	9
had	9
gone	9
six	9
paces	9
she	9
fell	9
to	9
the	9
ground,	9
her	9
delicate	9
feet	9
being	9
unable	9
to	9
bear	9
the	9
roughness	9
of	9
the	9
stones;	9
seeing	9
which,	9
the	9
three	9
hastened	9
towards	9
her,	9
and	9
the	9
curate	9
addressing	9
her	9
first	9
said:	9
“Stay,	9
señora,	9
whoever	9
you	9
may	9
be,	9
for	9
those	9
whom	9
you	9
see	9
here	9
only	9
desire	9
to	9
be	9
of	9
service	9
to	9
you;	9
you	9
have	9
no	9
need	9
to	9
attempt	9
a	9
flight	9
so	9
heedless,	9
for	9
neither	9
can	9
your	9
feet	9
bear	9
it,	9
nor	9
we	9
allow	9
it.”	9
Taken	9
by	9
surprise	9
and	9
bewildered,	9
she	9
made	9
no	9
reply	9
to	9
these	9
words.	9
They,	9
however,	9
came	9
towards	9
her,	9
and	9
the	9
curate	9
taking	9
her	9
hand	9
went	9
on	9
to	9
say:	9
“What	9
your	9
dress	9
would	9
hide,	9
señora,	9
is	9
made	9
known	9
to	9
us	9
by	9
your	9
hair;	9
a	9
clear	9
proof	9
that	9
it	9
can	9
be	9
no	9
trifling	9
cause	9
that	9
has	9
disguised	9
your	9
beauty	9
in	9
a	9
garb	9
so	9
unworthy	9
of	9
it,	9
and	9
sent	9
it	9
into	9
solitudes	9
like	9
these	9
where	9
we	9
have	9
had	9
the	9
good	9
fortune	9
to	9
find	9
you,	9
if	9
not	9
to	9
relieve	9
your	9
distress,	9
at	9
least	9
to	9
offer	9
you	9
comfort;	9
for	9
no	9
distress,	9
so	9
long	9
as	9
life	9
lasts,	9
can	9
be	9
so	9
oppressive	9
or	9
reach	9
such	9
a	9
height	9
as	9
to	9
make	9
the	9
sufferer	9
refuse	9
to	9
listen	9
to	9
comfort	9
offered	9
with	9
good	9
intention.	9
And	9
so,	9
señora,	9
or	9
señor,	9
or	9
whatever	9
you	9
prefer	9
to	9
be,	9
dismiss	9
the	9
fears	9
that	9
our	9
appearance	9
has	9
caused	9
you	9
and	9
make	9
us	9
acquainted	9
with	9
your	9
good	9
or	9
evil	9
fortunes,	9
for	9
from	9
all	9
of	9
us	9
together,	9
or	9
from	9
each	9
one	9
of	9
us,	9
you	9
will	9
receive	9
sympathy	9
in	9
your	9
trouble.”	9
While	9
the	9
curate	9
was	9
speaking,	9
the	9
disguised	9
damsel	9
stood	9
as	9
if	9
spell-bound,	9
looking	9
at	9
them	9
without	9
opening	9
her	9
lips	9
or	9
uttering	9
a	9
word,	9
just	9
like	9
a	9
village	9
rustic	9
to	9
whom	9
something	9
strange	9
that	9
he	9
has	9
never	9
seen	9
before	9
has	9
been	9
suddenly	9
shown;	9
but	9
on	9
the	9
curate	9
addressing	9
some	9
further	9
words	9
to	9
the	9
same	9
effect	9
to	9
her,	9
sighing	9
deeply	9
she	9
broke	9
silence	9
and	9
said:	9
“Since	9
the	9
solitude	9
of	9
these	9
mountains	9
has	9
been	9
unable	9
to	9
conceal	9
me,	9
and	9
the	9
escape	9
of	9
my	9
dishevelled	9
tresses	9
will	9
not	9
allow	9
my	9
tongue	9
to	9
deal	9
in	9
falsehoods,	9
it	9
would	9
be	9
idle	9
for	9
me	9
now	9
to	9
make	9
any	9
further	9
pretence	9
of	9
what,	9
if	9
you	9
were	9
to	9
believe	9
me,	9
you	9
would	9
believe	9
more	9
out	9
of	9
courtesy	9
than	9
for	9
any	9
other	9
reason.	9
This	9
being	9
so,	9
I	9
say	9
I	9
thank	9
you,	9
sirs,	9
for	9
the	9
offer	9
you	9
have	9
made	9
me,	9
which	9
places	9
me	9
under	9
the	9
obligation	9
of	9
complying	9
with	9
the	9
request	9
you	9
have	9
made	9
of	9
me;	9
though	9
I	9
fear	9
the	9
account	9
I	9
shall	9
give	9
you	9
of	9
my	9
misfortunes	9
will	9
excite	9
in	9
you	9
as	9
much	9
concern	9
as	9
compassion,	9
for	9
you	9
will	9
be	9
unable	9
to	9
suggest	9
anything	9
to	9
remedy	9
them	9
or	9
any	9
consolation	9
to	9
alleviate	9
them.	9
However,	9
that	9
my	9
honour	9
may	9
not	9
be	9
left	9
a	9
matter	9
of	9
doubt	9
in	9
your	9
minds,	9
now	9
that	9
you	9
have	9
discovered	9
me	9
to	9
be	9
a	9
woman,	9
and	9
see	9
that	9
I	9
am	9
young,	9
alone,	9
and	9
in	9
this	9
dress,	9
things	9
that	9
taken	9
together	9
or	9
separately	9
would	9
be	9
enough	9
to	9
destroy	9
any	9
good	9
name,	9
I	9
feel	9
bound	9
to	9
tell	9
what	9
I	9
would	9
willingly	9
keep	9
secret	9
if	9
I	9
could.”	9
All	9
this	9
she	9
who	9
was	9
now	9
seen	9
to	9
be	9
a	9
lovely	9
woman	9
delivered	9
without	9
any	9
hesitation,	9
with	9
so	9
much	9
ease	9
and	9
in	9
so	9
sweet	9
a	9
voice	9
that	9
they	9
were	9
not	9
less	9
charmed	9
by	9
her	9
intelligence	9
than	9
by	9
her	9
beauty,	9
and	9
as	9

again	9
repeated	9

entreaties	9
to	9

to	9
fulfil	9
her	9
promise,	9
she	9
without	9
further	9
pressing,	9
first	9
modestly	9
covering	9
her	9
feet	9
and	9
gathering	9
up	9
her	9
hair,	9
seated	9
herself	9
on	9
a	9
stone	9
with	9
the	9
three	9
placed	9
around	9
her,	9
and,	9
after	9
an	9
effort	9
to	9
restrain	9
some	9
tears	9
that	9
came	9
to	9
her	9
eyes,	9
in	9
a	9
clear	9
and	9
steady	9
voice	9
began	9
her	9
story	9
thus:	9
“In	9

one	9
of	9
those	9
that	9
are	9
called	9
Grandees	9
of	9
Spain.	9
This	9
nobleman	9
has	9
two	9
sons,	9
the	9
elder	9
heir	9
to	9
his	9
dignity	9
and	9
apparently	9
to	9
his	9
good	9
qualities;	9
the	9
younger	9
heir	9
to	9
I	9
know	9
not	9
what,	9
unless	9
it	9
be	9
the	9
treachery	9
of	9
Vellido	9
and	9
the	9
falsehood	9
of	9
Ganelon.	9
My	9
parents	9
are	9
this	9
lord’s	9
vassals,	9
lowly	9
in	9
origin,	9
but	9
so	9
wealthy	9
that	9
if	9
birth	9
had	9
conferred	9
as	9
much	9
on	9
them	9
as	9
fortune,	9
they	9
would	9
have	9
had	9
nothing	9
left	9
to	9
desire,	9
nor	9
should	9
I	9
have	9
had	9
reason	9
to	9
fear	9
trouble	9
like	9
that	9
in	9
which	9
I	9
find	9
myself	9
now;	9
for	9
it	9
may	9
be	9
that	9
my	9
ill	9
fortune	9
came	9
of	9
theirs	9
in	9
not	9
having	9
been	9
nobly	9
born.	9
It	9
is	9
true	9
they	9
are	9
not	9
so	9
low	9
that	9
they	9
have	9
any	9
reason	9
to	9
be	9
ashamed	9
of	9
their	9
condition,	9
but	9
neither	9
are	9
they	9
so	9
high	9
as	9
to	9
remove	9
from	9
my	9
mind	9
the	9
impression	9
that	9
my	9
mishap	9
comes	9
of	9
their	9
humble	9
birth.	9
They	9
are,	9
in	9
short,	9
peasants,	9
plain	9
homely	9
people,	9
without	9
any	9
taint	9
of	9
disreputable	9
blood,	9
and,	9
as	9
the	9
saying	9
is,	9
old	9
rusty	9
Christians,	9
but	9
so	9
rich	9
that	9
by	9
their	9
wealth	9
and	9
free-handed	9
way	9
of	9
life	9
they	9
are	9
coming	9
by	9
degrees	9
to	9
be	9
considered	9
gentlefolk	9
by	9
birth,	9
and	9
even	9
by	9
position;	9
though	9
the	9
wealth	9
and	9
nobility	9
they	9
thought	9
most	9
of	9
was	9
having	9
me	9
for	9
their	9
daughter;	9
and	9
as	9
they	9
have	9
no	9
other	9
child	9
to	9
make	9
their	9
heir,	9
and	9
are	9
affectionate	9
parents,	9
I	9
was	9
one	9
of	9
the	9
most	9
indulged	9
daughters	9
that	9
ever	9
parents	9
indulged.	9
“I	9
was	9
the	9
mirror	9
in	9
which	9
they	9
beheld	9
themselves,	9
the	9
staff	9
of	9
their	9
old	9
age,	9
and	9
the	9
object	9
in	9
which,	9
with	9
submission	9
to	9
Heaven,	9
all	9
their	9
wishes	9
centred,	9
and	9
mine	9
were	9
in	9
accordance	9
with	9
theirs,	9
for	9
I	9
knew	9
their	9
worth;	9
and	9
as	9
I	9
was	9
mistress	9
of	9
their	9
hearts,	9
so	9
was	9
I	9
also	9
of	9
their	9
possessions.	9
Through	9
me	9
they	9
engaged	9
or	9
dismissed	9
their	9
servants;	9
through	9
my	9
hands	9
passed	9
the	9
accounts	9
and	9
returns	9
of	9
what	9
was	9
sown	9
and	9
reaped;	9
the	9
oil-mills,	9
the	9
wine-presses,	9
the	9
count	9
of	9
the	9
flocks	9
and	9
herds,	9
the	9
beehives,	9
all	9
in	9
short	9
that	9
a	9
rich	9
farmer	9
like	9
my	9
father	9
has	9
or	9
can	9
have,	9
I	9
had	9
under	9
my	9
care,	9
and	9
I	9
acted	9
as	9
steward	9
and	9
mistress	9
with	9
an	9
assiduity	9
on	9
my	9
part	9
and	9
satisfaction	9
on	9
theirs	9
that	9
I	9
cannot	9
well	9
describe	9
to	9
you.	9
The	9
leisure	9
hours	9
left	9
to	9
me	9
after	9
I	9
had	9
given	9
the	9
requisite	9
orders	9
to	9
the	9
head-shepherds,	9
overseers,	9
and	9
other	9
labourers,	9
I	9
passed	9
in	9
such	9
employments	9
as	9
are	9
not	9
only	9
allowable	9
but	9
necessary	9
for	9
young	9
girls,	9
those	9
that	9
the	9
needle,	9
embroidery	9
cushion,	9
and	9
spinning	9
wheel	9
usually	9
afford,	9
and	9
if	9
to	9
refresh	9
my	9
mind	9
I	9
quitted	9
them	9
for	9
a	9
while,	9
I	9
found	9
recreation	9
in	9
reading	9
some	9
devotional	9
book	9
or	9
playing	9
the	9
harp,	9
for	9
experience	9
taught	9
me	9
that	9
music	9
soothes	9
the	9
troubled	9
mind	9
and	9
relieves	9
weariness	9
of	9
spirit.	9
Such	9
was	9
the	9
life	9
I	9
led	9
in	9
my	9
parents’	9
house	9
and	9
if	9
I	9
have	9
depicted	9
it	9
thus	9
minutely,	9
it	9
is	9
not	9
out	9
of	9
ostentation,	9
or	9
to	9
let	9
you	9
know	9
that	9
I	9
am	9
rich,	9
but	9
that	9
you	9
may	9
see	9
how,	9
without	9
any	9
fault	9
of	9
mine,	9
I	9
have	9
fallen	9
from	9
the	9
happy	9
condition	9
I	9
have	9
described,	9
to	9
the	9
misery	9
I	9
am	9
in	9
at	9
present.	9
The	9
truth	9
is,	9
that	9
while	9
I	9
was	9
leading	9
this	9
busy	9
life,	9
in	9
a	9
retirement	9
that	9
might	9
compare	9
with	9
that	9
of	9
a	9
monastery,	9
and	9
unseen	9
as	9
I	9
thought	9
by	9
any	9
except	9
the	9
servants	9
of	9
the	9
house	9
(for	9
when	9
I	9
went	9
to	9
Mass	9
it	9
was	9
so	9
early	9
in	9
the	9
morning,	9
and	9
I	9
was	9
so	9
closely	9
attended	9
by	9
my	9
mother	9
and	9
the	9
women	9
of	9
the	9
household,	9
and	9
so	9
thickly	9
veiled	9
and	9
so	9
shy,	9
that	9
my	9
eyes	9
scarcely	9
saw	9
more	9
ground	9
than	9
I	9
trod	9
on),	9
in	9
spite	9
of	9
all	9
this,	9
the	9
eyes	9
of	9
love,	9
or	9
idleness,	9
more	9
properly	9
speaking,	9
that	9
the	9
lynx’s	9
cannot	9
rival,	9
discovered	9
me,	9
with	9
the	9
help	9
of	9
the	9
assiduity	9
of	9
Don	9
Fernando;	9
for	9
that	9
is	9
the	9
name	9
of	9
the	9
younger	9
son	9
of	9
the	9
duke	9
I	9
told	9
of.”	9
The	9
moment	9
the	9
speaker	9
mentioned	9
the	9
name	9
of	9
Don	9
Fernando,	9
Cardenio	9
changed	9
colour	9
and	9
broke	9
into	9
a	9
sweat,	9
with	9
such	9
signs	9
of	9
emotion	9
that	9
the	9
curate	9
and	9
the	9
barber,	9
who	9
observed	9
it,	9
feared	9
that	9
one	9
of	9
the	9
mad	9
fits	9
which	9
they	9
heard	9
attacked	9
him	9
sometimes	9
was	9
coming	9
upon	9
him;	9
but	9
Cardenio	9
showed	9
no	9
further	9
agitation	9
and	9
remained	9
quiet,	9
regarding	9
the	9
peasant	9
girl	9
with	9
fixed	9
attention,	9
for	9
he	9
began	9
to	9
suspect	9
who	9
she	9
was.	9
She,	9
however,	9
without	9
noticing	9
the	9
excitement	9
of	9
Cardenio,	9
continuing	9
her	9
story,	9
went	9
on	9
to	9
say:	9
“And	9
they	9
had	9
hardly	9
discovered	9
me,	9
when,	9
as	9
he	9
owned	9
afterwards,	9
he	9
was	9
smitten	9
with	9
a	9
violent	9
love	9
for	9
me,	9
as	9
the	9
manner	9
in	9
which	9
it	9
displayed	9
itself	9
plainly	9
showed.	9
But	9
to	9
shorten	9
the	9
long	9
recital	9
of	9
my	9
woes,	9
I	9
will	9
pass	9
over	9
in	9
silence	9
all	9
the	9
artifices	9
employed	9
by	9
Don	9
Fernando	9
for	9
declaring	9
his	9
passion	9
for	9
me.	9
He	9
bribed	9
all	9
the	9
household,	9
he	9
gave	9
and	9
offered	9
gifts	9
and	9
presents	9
to	9
my	9
parents;	9
every	9
day	9
was	9
like	9
a	9
holiday	9
or	9
a	9
merry-making	9
in	9
our	9
street;	9
by	9
night	9
no	9
one	9
could	9
sleep	9
for	9
the	9
music;	9
the	9
love	9
letters	9
that	9
used	9
to	9
come	9
to	9
my	9
hand,	9
no	9
one	9
knew	9
how,	9
were	9
innumerable,	9
full	9
of	9
tender	9
pleadings	9
and	9
pledges,	9
containing	9
more	9
promises	9
and	9
oaths	9
than	9
there	9
were	9
letters	9
in	9
them;	9
all	9
which	9
not	9
only	9
did	9
not	9
soften	9
me,	9
but	9
hardened	9
my	9
heart	9
against	9
him,	9
as	9
if	9
he	9
had	9
been	9
my	9
mortal	9
enemy,	9
and	9
as	9
if	9
everything	9
he	9
did	9
to	9
make	9
me	9
yield	9
were	9
done	9
with	9
the	9
opposite	9
intention.	9
Not	9
that	9
the	9
high-bred	9
bearing	9
of	9
Don	9
Fernando	9
was	9
disagreeable	9
to	9
me,	9
or	9
that	9
I	9
found	9
his	9
importunities	9
wearisome;	9
for	9
it	9
gave	9
me	9
a	9
certain	9
sort	9
of	9
satisfaction	9
to	9
find	9
myself	9
so	9
sought	9
and	9
prized	9
by	9
a	9
gentleman	9
of	9
such	9
distinction,	9
and	9
I	9
was	9
not	9
displeased	9
at	9
seeing	9
my	9
praises	9
in	9
his	9
letters	9
(for	9
however	9
ugly	9
we	9
women	9
may	9
be,	9
it	9
seems	9
to	9
me	9
it	9
always	9
pleases	9
us	9
to	9
hear	9
ourselves	9
called	9
beautiful)	9
but	9
that	9
my	9
own	9
sense	9
of	9
right	9
was	9
opposed	9
to	9
all	9
this,	9
as	9
well	9
as	9
the	9
repeated	9
advice	9
of	9
my	9
parents,	9
who	9
now	9
very	9
plainly	9
perceived	9
Don	9
Fernando’s	9
purpose,	9
for	9
he	9
cared	9
very	9
little	9
if	9
all	9
the	9
world	9
knew	9
it.	9
They	9
told	9
me	9
they	9
trusted	9
and	9
confided	9
their	9
honour	9
and	9
good	9
name	9
to	9
my	9
virtue	9
and	9
rectitude	9
alone,	9
and	9
bade	9
me	9
consider	9
the	9
disparity	9
between	9
Don	9
Fernando	9
and	9
myself,	9
from	9
which	9
I	9
might	9
conclude	9
that	9
his	9
intentions,	9
whatever	9
he	9
might	9
say	9
to	9
the	9
contrary,	9
had	9
for	9
their	9
aim	9
his	9
own	9
pleasure	9
rather	9
than	9
my	9
advantage;	9
and	9
if	9
I	9
were	9
at	9
all	9
desirous	9
of	9
opposing	9
an	9
obstacle	9
to	9
his	9
unreasonable	9
suit,	9
they	9
were	9
ready,	9
they	9
said,	9
to	9
marry	9
me	9
at	9
once	9
to	9
anyone	9
I	9
preferred,	9
either	9
among	9
the	9
leading	9
people	9
of	9
our	9
own	9
town,	9
or	9
of	9
any	9
of	9
those	9
in	9
the	9
neighbourhood;	9
for	9
with	9
their	9
wealth	9
and	9
my	9
good	9
name,	9
a	9
match	9
might	9
be	9
looked	9
for	9
in	9
any	9
quarter.	9
This	9
offer,	9
and	9
their	9
sound	9
advice	9
strengthened	9
my	9
resolution,	9
and	9
I	9
never	9
gave	9
Don	9
Fernando	9
a	9
word	9
in	9
reply	9
that	9
could	9
hold	9
out	9
to	9
him	9
any	9
hope	9
of	9
success,	9
however	9
remote.	9

“All	9
this	9
caution	9
of	9
mine,	9
which	9
he	9
must	9
have	9
taken	9
for	9
coyness,	9
had	9
apparently	9
the	9
effect	9
of	9
increasing	9
his	9
wanton	9
appetite—for	9
that	9
is	9
the	9
name	9
I	9
give	9
to	9
his	9
passion	9
for	9
me;	9
had	9
it	9
been	9
what	9
he	9
declared	9
it	9
to	9
be,	9
you	9
would	9
not	9
know	9
of	9
it	9
now,	9
because	9
there	9
would	9
have	9
been	9
no	9
occasion	9
to	9
tell	9
you	9
of	9
it.	9
At	9
length	9
he	9
learned	9
that	9
my	9
parents	9
were	9
contemplating	9
marriage	9
for	9
me	9
in	9
order	9
to	9
put	9
an	9
end	9
to	9
his	9
hopes	9
of	9
obtaining	9
possession	9
of	9
me,	9
or	9
at	9
least	9
to	9
secure	9
additional	9
protectors	9
to	9
watch	9
over	9
me,	9
and	9
this	9
intelligence	9
or	9
suspicion	9
made	9
him	9
act	9
as	9
you	9
shall	9
hear.	9
One	9
night,	9
as	9
I	9
was	9
in	9
my	9
chamber	9
with	9
no	9
other	9
companion	9
than	9
a	9
damsel	9
who	9
waited	9
on	9
me,	9
with	9
the	9
doors	9
carefully	9
locked	9
lest	9
my	9
honour	9
should	9
be	9
imperilled	9
through	9
any	9
carelessness,	9
I	9
know	9
not	9
nor	9
can	9
conceive	9
how	9
it	9
happened,	9
but,	9
with	9
all	9
this	9
seclusion	9
and	9
these	9
precautions,	9
and	9
in	9
the	9
solitude	9
and	9
silence	9
of	9
my	9
retirement,	9
I	9
found	9
him	9
standing	9
before	9
me,	9
a	9
vision	9
that	9
so	9
astounded	9
me	9
that	9
it	9
deprived	9
my	9
eyes	9
of	9
sight,	9
and	9
my	9
tongue	9
of	9
speech.	9
I	9
had	9
no	9
power	9
to	9
utter	9
a	9
cry,	9
nor,	9
I	9
think,	9
did	9
he	9
give	9
me	9
time	9
to	9
utter	9
one,	9
as	9
he	9
immediately	9
approached	9
me,	9
and	9
taking	9
me	9
in	9
his	9
arms	9
(for,	9
overwhelmed	9
as	9
I	9
was,	9
I	9
was	9
powerless,	9
I	9
say,	9
to	9
help	9
myself),	9
he	9
began	9
to	9
make	9
such	9
professions	9
to	9
me	9
that	9
I	9
know	9
not	9
how	9
falsehood	9
could	9
have	9
had	9
the	9
power	9
of	9
dressing	9
them	9
up	9
to	9
seem	9
so	9
like	9
truth;	9
and	9
the	9
traitor	9
contrived	9
that	9
his	9
tears	9
should	9
vouch	9
for	9
his	9
words,	9
and	9
his	9
sighs	9
for	9
his	9
sincerity.	9
“I,	9
a	9
poor	9
young	9
creature	9
alone,	9
ill	9
versed	9
among	9
my	9
people	9
in	9
cases	9
such	9
as	9
this,	9
began,	9
I	9
know	9
not	9
how,	9
to	9
think	9
all	9
these	9
lying	9
protestations	9
true,	9
though	9
without	9
being	9
moved	9
by	9
his	9
sighs	9
and	9
tears	9
to	9
anything	9
more	9
than	9
pure	9
compassion;	9
and	9
so,	9
as	9
the	9
first	9
feeling	9
of	9
bewilderment	9
passed	9
away,	9
and	9
I	9
began	9
in	9
some	9
degree	9
to	9
recover	9
myself,	9
I	9
said	9
to	9
him	9
with	9
more	9
courage	9
than	9
I	9
thought	9
I	9
could	9
have	9
possessed,	9
‘If,	9
as	9
I	9
am	9
now	9
in	9
your	9
arms,	9
señor,	9
I	9
were	9
in	9
the	9
claws	9
of	9
a	9
fierce	9
lion,	9
and	9
my	9
deliverance	9
could	9
be	9
procured	9
by	9
doing	9
or	9
saying	9
anything	9
to	9
the	9
prejudice	9
of	9
my	9
honour,	9
it	9
would	9
no	9
more	9
be	9
in	9
my	9
power	9
to	9
do	9
it	9
or	9
say	9
it,	9
than	9
it	9
would	9
be	9
possible	9
that	9
what	9
was	9
should	9
not	9
have	9
been;	9
so	9
then,	9
if	9
you	9
hold	9
my	9
body	9
clasped	9
in	9
your	9
arms,	9
I	9
hold	9
my	9
soul	9
secured	9
by	9
virtuous	9
intentions,	9
very	9
different	9
from	9
yours,	9
as	9
you	9
will	9
see	9
if	9
you	9
attempt	9
to	9
carry	9
them	9
into	9
effect	9
by	9
force.	9
I	9
am	9
your	9
vassal,	9
but	9
I	9
am	9
not	9
your	9
slave;	9
your	9
nobility	9
neither	9
has	9
nor	9
should	9
have	9
any	9
right	9
to	9
dishonour	9
or	9
degrade	9
my	9
humble	9
birth;	9
and	9
low-born	9
peasant	9
as	9
I	9
am,	9
I	9
have	9
my	9
self-respect	9
as	9
much	9
as	9
you,	9
a	9
lord	9
and	9
gentleman:	9
with	9
me	9
your	9
violence	9
will	9
be	9
to	9
no	9
purpose,	9
your	9
wealth	9
will	9
have	9
no	9
weight,	9
your	9
words	9
will	9
have	9
no	9
power	9
to	9
deceive	9
me,	9
nor	9
your	9
sighs	9
or	9
tears	9
to	9
soften	9
me:	9
were	9
I	9
to	9
see	9
any	9
of	9
the	9
things	9
I	9
speak	9
of	9
in	9
him	9
whom	9
my	9
parents	9
gave	9
me	9
as	9
a	9
husband,	9
his	9
will	9
should	9
be	9
mine,	9
and	9
mine	9
should	9
be	9
bounded	9
by	9
his;	9
and	9
my	9
honour	9
being	9
preserved	9
even	9
though	9
my	9
inclinations	9
were	9
not	9
would	9
willingly	9
yield	9
him	9
what	9
you,	9
señor,	9
would	9
now	9
obtain	9
by	9
force;	9
and	9
this	9
I	9
say	9
lest	9
you	9
should	9
suppose	9
that	9
any	9
but	9
my	9
lawful	9
husband	9
shall	9
ever	9
win	9
anything	9
of	9
me.’	9
‘If	9
that,’	9
said	9
this	9
disloyal	9
gentleman,	9
‘be	9
the	9
only	9
scruple	9
you	9
feel,	9
fairest	9
Dorothea’	9
(for	9
that	9
is	9
the	9
name	9
of	9
this	9
unhappy	9
being),	9
‘see	9
here	9
I	9
give	9
you	9
my	9
hand	9
to	9
be	9
yours,	9
and	9
let	9
Heaven,	9
from	9
which	9
nothing	9
is	9
hid,	9
and	9
this	9
image	9
of	9
Our	9
Lady	9
you	9
have	9
here,	9
be	9
witnesses	9
of	9
this	9
pledge.’”	9

When	9
Cardenio	9
heard	9
her	9
say	9
she	9
was	9
called	9
Dorothea,	9
he	9
showed	9
fresh	9
agitation	9
and	9
felt	9
convinced	9
of	9
the	9
truth	9
of	9
his	9
former	9
suspicion,	9
but	9
he	9
was	9
unwilling	9
to	9
interrupt	9
the	9
story,	9
and	9
wished	9
to	9
hear	9
the	9
end	9
of	9
what	9
he	9
already	9
all	9
but	9
knew,	9
so	9
he	9
merely	9
said:	9
“What!	9
is	9
Dorothea	9
your	9
name,	9
señora?	9
I	9
have	9
heard	9
of	9
another	9
of	9
the	9
same	9
name	9
who	9
can	9
perhaps	9
match	9
your	9
misfortunes.	9
But	9
proceed;	9
by-and-by	9
I	9
may	9
tell	9
you	9
something	9
that	9
will	9
astonish	9
you	9
as	9
much	9
as	9
it	9
will	9
excite	9
your	9
compassion.”	9
Dorothea	9
was	9
struck	9
by	9
Cardenio’s	9
words	9
as	9
well	9
as	9
by	9
his	9
strange	9
and	9
miserable	9
attire,	9
and	9
begged	9
him	9
if	9
he	9
knew	9
anything	9
concerning	9
her	9
to	9
tell	9
it	9
to	9
her	9
at	9
once,	9
for	9
if	9
fortune	9
had	9
left	9
her	9
any	9
blessing	9
it	9
was	9
courage	9
to	9
bear	9
whatever	9
calamity	9
might	9
fall	9
upon	9
her,	9
as	9
she	9
felt	9
sure	9
that	9
none	9
could	9
reach	9
her	9
capable	9
of	9
increasing	9
in	9
any	9
degree	9
what	9
she	9
endured	9
already.	9
“I	9
would	9
not	9
let	9
the	9
occasion	9
pass,	9
señora,”	9
replied	9
Cardenio,	9
“of	9
telling	9
you	9
what	9
I	9
think,	9
if	9
what	9
I	9
suspect	9
were	9
the	9
truth,	9
but	9
so	9
far	9
there	9
has	9
been	9
no	9
opportunity,	9
nor	9
is	9
it	9
of	9
any	9
importance	9
to	9
you	9
to	9
know	9
it.”	9
“Be	9
it	9
as	9
it	9
may,”	9
replied	9
Dorothea,	9
“what	9
happened	9
in	9
my	9
story	9
was	9
that	9
Don	9
Fernando,	9
taking	9
an	9
image	9
that	9
stood	9
in	9
the	9
chamber,	9
placed	9
it	9
as	9
a	9
witness	9
of	9
our	9
betrothal,	9
and	9
with	9
the	9
most	9
binding	9
words	9
and	9
extravagant	9
oaths	9
gave	9
me	9
his	9
promise	9
to	9
become	9
my	9
husband;	9
though	9
before	9
he	9
had	9
made	9
an	9
end	9
of	9
pledging	9
himself	9
I	9
bade	9
him	9
consider	9
well	9
what	9
he	9
was	9
doing,	9
and	9
think	9
of	9
the	9
anger	9
his	9
father	9
would	9
feel	9
at	9
seeing	9
him	9
married	9
to	9
a	9
peasant	9
girl	9
and	9
one	9
of	9
his	9
vassals;	9
I	9
told	9
him	9
not	9
to	9
let	9
my	9
beauty,	9
such	9
as	9
it	9
was,	9
blind	9
him,	9
for	9
that	9
was	9
not	9
enough	9
to	9
furnish	9
an	9
excuse	9
for	9
his	9
transgression;	9
and	9
if	9
in	9
the	9
love	9
he	9
bore	9
me	9
he	9
wished	9
to	9
do	9
me	9
any	9
kindness,	9
it	9
would	9
be	9
to	9
leave	9
my	9
lot	9
to	9
follow	9
its	9
course	9
at	9
the	9
level	9
my	9
condition	9
required;	9
for	9
marriages	9
so	9
unequal	9
never	9
brought	9
happiness,	9
nor	9
did	9
they	9
continue	9
long	9
to	9
afford	9
the	9
enjoyment	9
they	9
began	9
with.	9
“All	9
this	9
that	9
I	9
have	9
now	9
repeated	9
I	9
said	9
to	9
him,	9
and	9
much	9
more	9
which	9
I	9
cannot	9
recollect;	9
but	9
it	9
had	9
no	9
effect	9
in	9
inducing	9
him	9
to	9
forego	9
his	9
purpose;	9
he	9
who	9
has	9
no	9
intention	9
of	9
paying	9
does	9
not	9
trouble	9
himself	9
about	9
difficulties	9
when	9
he	9
is	9
striking	9
the	9
bargain.	9
At	9
the	9
same	9
time	9
I	9
argued	9
the	9
matter	9
briefly	9
in	9
my	9
own	9
mind,	9
saying	9
to	9
myself,	9
‘I	9
shall	9
not	9
be	9
the	9
first	9
who	9
has	9
risen	9
through	9
marriage	9
from	9
a	9
lowly	9
to	9
a	9
lofty	9
station,	9
nor	9
will	9
Don	9
Fernando	9
be	9
the	9
first	9
whom	9
beauty	9
or,	9
as	9
is	9
more	9
likely,	9
a	9
blind	9
attachment,	9
has	9
led	9
to	9
mate	9
himself	9
below	9
his	9
rank.	9
Then,	9
since	9
I	9
am	9
introducing	9
no	9
new	9
usage	9
or	9
practice,	9
I	9
may	9
as	9
well	9
avail	9
myself	9
of	9
the	9
honour	9
that	9
chance	9
offers	9
me,	9
for	9
even	9
though	9
his	9
inclination	9
for	9
me	9
should	9
not	9
outlast	9
the	9
attainment	9
of	9
his	9
wishes,	9
I	9
shall	9
be,	9
after	9
all,	9
his	9
wife	9
before	9
God.	9
And	9
if	9
I	9
strive	9
to	9
repel	9
him	9
by	9
scorn,	9
I	9
can	9
see	9
that,	9
fair	9
means	9
failing,	9
he	9
is	9
in	9
a	9
mood	9
to	9
use	9
force,	9
and	9
I	9
shall	9
be	9
left	9
dishonoured	9
and	9
without	9
any	9
means	9
of	9
proving	9
my	9
innocence	9
to	9
those	9
who	9
cannot	9
know	9
how	9
innocently	9
I	9
have	9
come	9
to	9
be	9
in	9
this	9
position;	9
for	9
what	9
arguments	9
would	9
persuade	9
my	9
parents	9
that	9
this	9
gentleman	9
entered	9
my	9
chamber	9
without	9
my	9
consent?’	9
“All	9
these	9
questions	9
and	9
answers	9
passed	9
through	9
my	9
mind	9
in	9
a	9
moment;	9
but	9
the	9
oaths	9
of	9
Don	9
Fernando,	9
the	9
witnesses	9
he	9
appealed	9
to,	9
the	9
tears	9
he	9
shed,	9
and	9
lastly	9
the	9
charms	9
of	9
his	9
person	9
and	9
his	9
high-bred	9
grace,	9
which,	9
accompanied	9
by	9
such	9
signs	9
of	9
genuine	9
love,	9
might	9
well	9
have	9
conquered	9
a	9
heart	9
even	9
more	9
free	9
and	9
coy	9
than	9
mine—these	9
were	9
the	9
things	9
that	9
more	9
than	9
all	9
began	9
to	9
influence	9
me	9
and	9
lead	9
me	9
unawares	9
to	9
my	9
ruin.	9
I	9
called	9
my	9
waiting-maid	9
to	9
me,	9
that	9
there	9
might	9
be	9
a	9
witness	9
on	9
earth	9
besides	9
those	9
in	9
Heaven,	9
and	9
again	9
Don	9
Fernando	9
renewed	9
and	9
repeated	9
his	9
oaths,	9
invoked	9
as	9
witnesses	9
fresh	9
saints	9
in	9
addition	9
to	9
the	9
former	9
ones,	9
called	9
down	9
upon	9
himself	9
a	9
thousand	9
curses	9
hereafter	9
should	9
he	9
fail	9
to	9
keep	9
his	9
promise,	9
shed	9
more	9
tears,	9
redoubled	9
his	9
sighs	9
and	9
pressed	9
me	9
closer	9
in	9
his	9
arms,	9
from	9
which	9
he	9
had	9
never	9
allowed	9
me	9
to	9
escape;	9
and	9
so	9
I	9
was	9
left	9
by	9
my	9
maid,	9
and	9
ceased	9
to	9
be	9
one,	9
and	9
he	9
became	9
a	9
traitor	9
and	9
a	9
perjured	9
man.	9
“The	9
day	9
which	9
followed	9
the	9
night	9
of	9
my	9
misfortune	9
did	9
not	9
come	9
so	9
quickly,	9
I	9
imagine,	9
as	9
Don	9
Fernando	9
wished,	9
for	9
when	9
desire	9
has	9
attained	9
its	9
object,	9
the	9
greatest	9
pleasure	9
is	9
to	9
fly	9
from	9
the	9
scene	9
of	9
pleasure.	9
I	9
say	9
so	9
because	9
Don	9
Fernando	9
made	9
all	9
haste	9
to	9
leave	9
me,	9
and	9
by	9
the	9
adroitness	9
of	9
my	9
maid,	9
who	9
was	9
indeed	9
the	9
one	9
who	9
had	9
admitted	9
him,	9
gained	9
the	9
street	9
before	9
daybreak;	9
but	9
on	9
taking	9
leave	9
of	9
me	9
he	9
told	9
me,	9
though	9
not	9
with	9
as	9
much	9
earnestness	9
and	9
fervour	9
as	9
when	9
he	9
came,	9
that	9
I	9
might	9
rest	9
assured	9
of	9
his	9
faith	9
and	9
of	9
the	9
sanctity	9
and	9
sincerity	9
of	9
his	9
oaths;	9
and	9
to	9
confirm	9
his	9
words	9
he	9
drew	9
a	9
rich	9
ring	9
off	9
his	9
finger	9
and	9
placed	9
it	9
upon	9
mine.	9
He	9
then	9
took	9
his	9
departure	9
and	9
I	9
was	9
left,	9
I	9
know	9
not	9
whether	9
sorrowful	9
or	9
happy;	9
all	9
I	9
can	9
say	9
is,	9
I	9
was	9
left	9
agitated	9
and	9
troubled	9
in	9
mind	9
and	9
almost	9
bewildered	9
by	9
what	9
had	9
taken	9
place,	9
and	9
I	9
had	9
not	9
the	9
spirit,	9
or	9
else	9
it	9
did	9
not	9
occur	9
to	9
me,	9
to	9
chide	9
my	9
maid	9
for	9
the	9
treachery	9
she	9
had	9
been	9
guilty	9
of	9
in	9
concealing	9
Don	9
Fernando	9
in	9
my	9
chamber;	9
for	9
as	9
yet	9
I	9
was	9
unable	9
to	9
make	9
up	9
my	9
mind	9
whether	9
what	9
had	9
befallen	9
me	9
was	9
for	9
good	9
or	9
evil.	9
I	9
told	9
Don	9
Fernando	9
at	9
parting,	9
that	9
as	9
I	9
was	9
now	9
his,	9
he	9
might	9
see	9
me	9
on	9
other	9
nights	9
in	9
the	9
same	9
way,	9
until	9
it	9
should	9
be	9
his	9
pleasure	9
to	9
let	9
the	9
matter	9
become	9
known;	9
but,	9
except	9
the	9
following	9
night,	9
he	9
came	9
no	9
more,	9
nor	9
for	9
more	9
than	9
a	9
month	9
could	9
I	9
catch	9
a	9
glimpse	9
of	9
him	9
in	9
the	9
street	9
or	9
in	9
church,	9
while	9
I	9
wearied	9
myself	9
with	9
watching	9
for	9
one;	9
although	9
I	9
knew	9
he	9
was	9
in	9
the	9
town,	9
and	9
almost	9
every	9
day	9
went	9
out	9
hunting,	9
a	9
pastime	9
he	9
was	9
very	9
fond	9
of.	9
I	9
remember	9
well	9
how	9
sad	9
and	9
dreary	9
those	9
days	9
and	9
hours	9
were	9
to	9
me;	9
I	9
remember	9
well	9
how	9
I	9
began	9
to	9
doubt	9
as	9
they	9
went	9
by,	9
and	9
even	9
to	9
lose	9
confidence	9
in	9
the	9
faith	9
of	9
Don	9
Fernando;	9
and	9
I	9
remember,	9
too,	9
how	9
my	9
maid	9
heard	9
those	9
words	9
in	9
reproof	9
of	9
her	9
audacity	9
that	9
she	9
had	9
not	9
heard	9
before,	9
and	9
how	9
I	9
was	9
forced	9
to	9
put	9
a	9
constraint	9
on	9
my	9
tears	9
and	9
on	9
the	9
expression	9
of	9
my	9
countenance,	9
not	9
to	9
give	9
my	9
parents	9
cause	9
to	9
ask	9
me	9
why	9
I	9
was	9
so	9
melancholy,	9
and	9
drive	9
me	9
to	9
invent	9
falsehoods	9
in	9
reply.	9
But	9
all	9
this	9
was	9
suddenly	9
brought	9
to	9
an	9
end,	9
for	9
the	9
time	9
came	9
when	9
all	9
such	9
considerations	9
were	9
disregarded,	9
and	9
there	9
was	9
no	9
further	9
question	9
of	9
honour,	9
when	9
my	9
patience	9
gave	9
way	9
and	9
the	9
secret	9
of	9
my	9
heart	9
became	9
known	9
abroad.	9
The	9
reason	9
was,	9
that	9
a	9
few	9
days	9
later	9
it	9
was	9
reported	9
in	9
the	9
town	9
that	9
Don	9
Fernando	9
had	9
been	9
married	9
in	9
a	9
neighbouring	9
city	9
to	9
a	9
maiden	9
of	9
rare	9
beauty,	9
the	9
daughter	9
of	9
parents	9
of	9
distinguished	9
position,	9
though	9
not	9
so	9
rich	9
that	9
her	9
portion	9
would	9
entitle	9
her	9
to	9
look	9
for	9
so	9
brilliant	9
a	9
match;	9
it	9
was	9
said,	9
too,	9
that	9
her	9
name	9
was	9
Luscinda,	9
and	9
that	9
at	9
the	9
betrothal	9
some	9
strange	9
things	9
had	9
happened.”	9
Cardenio	9
heard	9
the	9
name	9
of	9
Luscinda,	9
but	9
he	9
only	9
shrugged	9
his	9
shoulders,	9
bit	9
his	9
lips,	9
bent	9
his	9
brows,	9
and	9
before	9
long	9
two	9
streams	9
of	9
tears	9
escaped	9
from	9
his	9
eyes.	9
Dorothea,	9
however,	9
did	9
not	9
interrupt	9
her	9
story,	9
but	9
went	9
on	9
in	9
these	9
words:	9
“This	9
sad	9
intelligence	9
reached	9
my	9
ears,	9
and,	9
instead	9
of	9
being	9
struck	9
with	9
a	9
chill,	9
with	9
such	9
wrath	9
and	9
fury	9
did	9
my	9
heart	9
burn	9
that	9
I	9
scarcely	9
restrained	9
myself	9
from	9
rushing	9
out	9
into	9
the	9
streets,	9
crying	9
aloud	9
and	9
proclaiming	9
openly	9
the	9
perfidy	9
and	9
treachery	9
of	9
which	9
I	9
was	9
the	9
victim;	9
but	9
this	9
transport	9
of	9
rage	9
was	9
for	9
the	9
time	9
checked	9
by	9
a	9
resolution	9
I	9
formed,	9
to	9
be	9
carried	9
out	9
the	9
same	9
night,	9
and	9
that	9
was	9
to	9
assume	9
this	9
dress,	9
which	9
I	9
got	9
from	9
a	9
servant	9
of	9
my	9
father’s,	9
one	9
of	9
the	9
zagals,	9
as	9
they	9
are	9
called	9
in	9
farmhouses,	9
to	9
whom	9
I	9
confided	9
the	9
whole	9
of	9
my	9
misfortune,	9
and	9
whom	9
I	9
entreated	9
to	9
accompany	9
me	9
to	9
the	9
city	9
where	9
I	9
heard	9
my	9
enemy	9
was.	9
He,	9
though	9
he	9
remonstrated	9
with	9
me	9
for	9
my	9
boldness,	9
and	9
condemned	9
my	9
resolution,	9
when	9
he	9
saw	9
me	9
bent	9
upon	9
my	9
purpose,	9
offered	9
to	9
bear	9
me	9
company,	9
as	9
he	9
said,	9
to	9
the	9
end	9
of	9
the	9
world.	9
I	9
at	9
once	9
packed	9
up	9
in	9
a	9
linen	9
pillow-case	9
a	9
woman’s	9
dress,	9
and	9
some	9
jewels	9
and	9
money	9
to	9
provide	9
for	9
emergencies,	9
and	9
in	9
the	9
silence	9
of	9
the	9
night,	9
without	9
letting	9
my	9
treacherous	9
maid	9
know,	9
I	9
sallied	9
forth	9
from	9
the	9
house,	9
accompanied	9
by	9
my	9
servant	9
and	9
abundant	9
anxieties,	9
and	9
on	9
foot	9
set	9
out	9
for	9
the	9
city,	9
but	9
borne	9
as	9
it	9
were	9
on	9
wings	9
by	9
my	9
eagerness	9
to	9
reach	9
it,	9
if	9
not	9
to	9
prevent	9
what	9
I	9
presumed	9
to	9
be	9
already	9
done,	9
at	9
least	9
to	9
call	9
upon	9
Don	9
Fernando	9
to	9
tell	9
me	9
with	9
what	9
conscience	9
he	9
had	9
done	9
it.	9
I	9
reached	9
my	9
destination	9
in	9
two	9
days	9
and	9
a	9
half,	9
and	9
on	9
entering	9
the	9
city	9
inquired	9
for	9
the	9
house	9
of	9
Luscinda’s	9
parents.	9
The	9
first	9
person	9
I	9
asked	9
gave	9
me	9
more	9
in	9
reply	9
than	9
I	9
sought	9
to	9
know;	9
he	9
showed	9
me	9
the	9
house,	9
and	9
told	9
me	9
all	9
that	9
had	9
occurred	9
at	9
the	9
betrothal	9
of	9
the	9
daughter	9
of	9
the	9
family,	9
an	9
affair	9
of	9
such	9
notoriety	9
in	9
the	9
city	9
that	9
it	9
was	9
the	9
talk	9
of	9
every	9
knot	9
of	9
idlers	9
in	9
the	9
street.	9
He	9
said	9
that	9
on	9
the	9
night	9
of	9
Don	9
Fernando’s	9
betrothal	9
with	9
Luscinda,	9
as	9
soon	9
as	9
she	9
had	9
consented	9
to	9
be	9
his	9
bride	9
by	9
saying	9
‘Yes,’	9
she	9
was	9
taken	9
with	9
a	9
sudden	9
fainting	9
fit,	9
and	9
that	9
on	9
the	9
bridegroom	9
approaching	9
to	9
unlace	9
the	9
bosom	9
of	9
her	9
dress	9
to	9
give	9
her	9
air,	9
he	9
found	9
a	9
paper	9
in	9
her	9
own	9
handwriting,	9
in	9
which	9
she	9
said	9
and	9
declared	9
that	9
she	9
could	9
not	9
be	9
Don	9
Fernando’s	9
bride,	9
because	9
she	9
was	9
already	9
Cardenio’s,	9
who,	9
according	9
to	9
the	9
man’s	9
account,	9
was	9
a	9
gentleman	9
of	9
distinction	9
of	9
the	9
same	9
city;	9
and	9
that	9
if	9
she	9
had	9
accepted	9
Don	9
Fernando,	9
it	9
was	9
only	9
in	9
obedience	9
to	9
her	9
parents.	9
In	9
short,	9
he	9
said,	9
the	9
words	9
of	9
the	9
paper	9
made	9
it	9
clear	9
she	9
meant	9
to	9
kill	9
herself	9
on	9
the	9
completion	9
of	9
the	9
betrothal,	9
and	9
gave	9
her	9
reasons	9
for	9
putting	9
an	9
end	9
to	9
herself	9
all	9
which	9
was	9
confirmed,	9
it	9
was	9
said,	9
by	9
a	9
dagger	9
they	9
found	9
somewhere	9
in	9
her	9
clothes.	9
On	9
seeing	9
this,	9
Don	9
Fernando,	9
persuaded	9
that	9
Luscinda	9
had	9
befooled,	9
slighted,	9
and	9
trifled	9
with	9
him,	9
assailed	9
her	9
before	9
she	9
had	9
recovered	9
from	9
her	9
swoon,	9
and	9
tried	9
to	9
stab	9
her	9
with	9
the	9
dagger	9
that	9
had	9
been	9
found,	9
and	9
would	9
have	9
succeeded	9
had	9
not	9
her	9
parents	9
and	9
those	9
who	9
were	9
present	9
prevented	9
him.	9
It	9
was	9
said,	9
moreover,	9
that	9
Don	9
Fernando	9
went	9
away	9
at	9
once,	9
and	9
that	9
Luscinda	9
did	9
not	9
recover	9
from	9
her	9
prostration	9
until	9
the	9
next	9
day,	9
when	9
she	9
told	9
her	9
parents	9
how	9
she	9
was	9
really	9
the	9
bride	9
of	9
that	9
Cardenio	9
I	9
have	9
mentioned.	9
I	9
learned	9
besides	9
that	9
Cardenio,	9
according	9
to	9
report,	9
had	9
been	9
present	9
at	9
the	9
betrothal;	9
and	9
that	9
upon	9
seeing	9
her	9
betrothed	9
contrary	9
to	9
his	9
expectation,	9
he	9
had	9
quitted	9
the	9
city	9
in	9
despair,	9
leaving	9
behind	9
him	9
a	9
letter	9
declaring	9
the	9
wrong	9
Luscinda	9
had	9
done	9
him,	9
and	9
his	9
intention	9
of	9
going	9
where	9
no	9
one	9
should	9
ever	9
see	9
him	9
again.	9
All	9
this	9
was	9
a	9
matter	9
of	9
notoriety	9
in	9
the	9
city,	9
and	9
everyone	9
spoke	9
of	9
it;	9
especially	9
when	9
it	9
became	9
known	9
that	9
Luscinda	9
was	9
missing	9
from	9
her	9
father’s	9
house	9
and	9
from	9
the	9
city,	9
for	9
she	9
was	9
not	9
to	9
be	9
found	9
anywhere,	9
to	9
the	9
distraction	9
of	9
her	9
parents,	9
who	9
knew	9
not	9
what	9
steps	9
to	9
take	9
to	9
recover	9
her.	9
What	9
I	9
learned	9
revived	9
my	9
hopes,	9
and	9
I	9
was	9
better	9
pleased	9
not	9
to	9
have	9
found	9
Don	9
Fernando	9
than	9
to	9
find	9
him	9
married,	9
for	9
it	9
seemed	9
to	9
me	9
that	9
the	9
door	9
was	9
not	9
yet	9
entirely	9
shut	9
upon	9
relief	9
in	9
my	9
case,	9
and	9
I	9
thought	9
that	9
perhaps	9
Heaven	9
had	9
put	9
this	9
impediment	9
in	9
the	9
way	9
of	9
the	9
second	9
marriage,	9
to	9
lead	9
him	9
to	9
recognise	9
his	9
obligations	9
under	9
the	9
former	9
one,	9
and	9
reflect	9
that	9
as	9
a	9
Christian	9
he	9
was	9
bound	9
to	9
consider	9
his	9
soul	9
above	9
all	9
human	9
objects.	9
All	9
this	9
passed	9
through	9
my	9
mind,	9
and	9
I	9
strove	9
to	9
comfort	9
myself	9
without	9
comfort,	9
indulging	9
in	9
faint	9
and	9
distant	9
hopes	9
of	9
cherishing	9
that	9
life	9
that	9
I	9
now	9
abhor.	9
“But	9
while	9
I	9
was	9
in	9
the	9
city,	9
uncertain	9
what	9
to	9
do,	9
as	9
I	9
could	9
not	9
find	9
Don	9
Fernando,	9
I	9
heard	9
notice	9
given	9
by	9
the	9
public	9
crier	9
offering	9
a	9
great	9
reward	9
to	9
anyone	9
who	9
should	9
find	9
me,	9
and	9
giving	9
the	9
particulars	9
of	9
my	9
age	9
and	9
of	9
the	9
very	9
dress	9
I	9
wore;	9
and	9
I	9
heard	9
it	9
said	9
that	9
the	9
lad	9
who	9
came	9
with	9
me	9
had	9
taken	9
me	9
away	9
from	9
my	9
father’s	9
house;	9
a	9
thing	9
that	9
cut	9
me	9
to	9
the	9
heart,	9
showing	9
how	9
low	9
my	9
good	9
name	9
had	9
fallen,	9
since	9
it	9
was	9
not	9
enough	9
that	9
I	9
should	9
lose	9
it	9
by	9
my	9
flight,	9
but	9
they	9
must	9
add	9
with	9
whom	9
I	9
had	9
fled,	9
and	9
that	9
one	9
so	9
much	9
beneath	9
me	9
and	9
so	9
unworthy	9
of	9
my	9
consideration.	9
The	9
instant	9
I	9
heard	9
the	9
notice	9
I	9
quitted	9
the	9
city	9
with	9
my	9
servant,	9
who	9
now	9
began	9
to	9
show	9
signs	9
of	9
wavering	9
in	9
his	9
fidelity	9
to	9
me,	9
and	9
the	9
same	9
night,	9
for	9
fear	9
of	9
discovery,	9
we	9
entered	9
the	9
most	9
thickly	9
wooded	9
part	9
of	9
these	9
mountains.	9
But,	9
as	9
is	9
commonly	9
said,	9
one	9
evil	9
calls	9
up	9
another	9
and	9
the	9
end	9
of	9
one	9
misfortune	9
is	9
apt	9
to	9
be	9
the	9
beginning	9
of	9
one	9
still	9
greater,	9
and	9
so	9
it	9
proved	9
in	9
my	9
case;	9
for	9
my	9
worthy	9
servant,	9
until	9
then	9
so	9
faithful	9
and	9
trusty	9
when	9
he	9
found	9
me	9
in	9
this	9
lonely	9
spot,	9
moved	9
more	9
by	9
his	9
own	9
villainy	9
than	9
by	9
my	9
beauty,	9
sought	9
to	9
take	9
advantage	9
of	9
the	9
opportunity	9
which	9
these	9
solitudes	9
seemed	9
to	9
present	9
him,	9
and	9
with	9
little	9
shame	9
and	9
less	9
fear	9
of	9
God	9
and	9
respect	9
for	9
me,	9
began	9
to	9
make	9
overtures	9
to	9
me;	9
and	9
finding	9
that	9
I	9
replied	9
to	9
the	9
effrontery	9
of	9
his	9
proposals	9
with	9
justly	9
severe	9
language,	9
he	9
laid	9
aside	9
the	9
entreaties	9
which	9
he	9
had	9
employed	9
at	9
first,	9
and	9
began	9
to	9
use	9
violence.	9

so	9

mine	9
that	9
with	9

with	9
little	9

I	9
pushed	9

where	9
I	9
left	9
him,	9
whether	9

then,	9
with	9
greater	9

seemed	9
possible	9
in	9
my	9
terror	9

I	9
made	9

orders.	9
It	9
is	9
now	9
I	9
know	9
not	9
how	9
many	9
months	9
since	9
with	9
this	9
object	9
I	9
came	9
here,	9
where	9
I	9
met	9
a	9
herdsman	9
who	9
engaged	9
me	9
as	9
his	9
servant	9
at	9
a	9
place	9
in	9
the	9
heart	9
of	9
this	9
Sierra,	9
and	9
all	9
this	9
time	9
I	9
have	9
been	9
serving	9
him	9
as	9
herd,	9
striving	9
to	9
keep	9
always	9
afield	9
to	9
hide	9
these	9
locks	9
which	9
have	9
now	9
unexpectedly	9
betrayed	9
me.	9
But	9
all	9
my	9
care	9
and	9
pains	9
were	9
unavailing,	9
for	9
my	9
master	9
made	9
the	9
discovery	9
that	9
I	9
was	9
not	9
a	9
man,	9
and	9
harboured	9
the	9
same	9
base	9
designs	9
as	9
my	9
servant;	9
and	9
as	9
fortune	9
does	9
not	9
always	9
supply	9
a	9
remedy	9
in	9
cases	9
of	9
difficulty,	9
and	9
I	9
had	9
no	9
precipice	9
or	9
ravine	9
at	9
hand	9
down	9
which	9
to	9
fling	9
the	9
master	9
and	9
cure	9
his	9
passion,	9
as	9
I	9
had	9
in	9
the	9
servant’s	9
case,	9
I	9
thought	9
it	9
a	9
lesser	9
evil	9
to	9
leave	9
him	9
and	9
again	9
conceal	9
myself	9
among	9
these	9
crags,	9
than	9
make	9
trial	9
of	9
my	9
strength	9
and	9
argument	9
with	9
him.	9
So,	9
as	9
I	9
say,	9
once	9
more	9
I	9
went	9
into	9
hiding	9
to	9
seek	9
for	9
some	9
place	9
where	9
I	9
might	9
with	9
sighs	9

tears	9
implore	9
Heaven	9
to	9
have	9
pity	9
on	9
my	9
misery,	9
and	9
grant	9
me	9
help	9
and	9
strength	9
to	9
escape	9
from	9
it,	9
or	9
let	9
me	9
die	9
among	9
the	9
solitudes,	9
leaving	9
no	9
trace	9
of	9
an	9
unhappy	9
being	9
who,	9
by	9
no	9
fault	9

matter	9

the	9

my	9

you	9

present	9
myself	9
before	9
them	9
as	9
they	9
expect,	9
that	9
I	9
had	9
rather	9
banish	9
myself	9
from	9
their	9
sight	9
for	9
ever	9
than	9
look	9
them	9
in	9
the	9
face	9
with	9
the	9
reflection	9
that	9
they	9
beheld	9
mine	9
stripped	9
of	9
that	9
purity	9
they	9
had	9
a	9
right	9
to	9
expect	9
in	9
me.”	9
With	9
these	9
words	9
she	9
became	9
silent,	9
and	9
the	9
colour	9
that	9
overspread	9
her	9
face	9
showed	9
plainly	9
the	9
pain	9
and	9
shame	9
she	9
was	9
suffering	9
at	9
heart.	9
In	9
theirs	9
the	9
listeners	9
felt	9
as	9
much	9
pity	9
as	9
wonder	9
at	9
her	9
misfortunes;	9
but	9
as	9
the	9
curate	9
was	9
just	9
about	9
to	9
offer	9
her	9
some	9
consolation	9
and	9
advice	9
Cardenio	9
forestalled	9
him,	9
saying,	9
“So	9
then,	9
señora,	9
you	9
are	9
the	9
fair	9
Dorothea,	9
the	9
only	9
daughter	9
of	9
the	9
rich	9
Clenardo?”	9
Dorothea	9
was	9
astonished	9
at	9
hearing	9
her	9
father’s	9
name,	9
and	9
at	9
the	9
miserable	9
appearance	9
of	9
him	9
who	9
mentioned	9
it,	9
for	9
it	9
has	9
been	9
already	9
said	9
how	9
wretchedly	9
clad	9
Cardenio	9
was;	9
so	9
she	9
said	9
to	9
him:	9
“And	9
who	9
may	9
you	9
be,	9
brother,	9
who	9
seem	9
to	9
know	9
my	9
father’s	9
name	9
so	9
well?	9
For	9
so	9
far,	9
if	9
I	9
remember	9
rightly,	9
I	9
have	9
not	9
mentioned	9
it	9
in	9
the	9
whole	9
story	9
of	9
my	9
misfortunes.”	9
“I	9
am	9
that	9
unhappy	9
being,	9
señora,”	9
replied	9
Cardenio,	9
“whom,	9
as	9
you	9
have	9
said,	9
Luscinda	9
declared	9
to	9
be	9
her	9
husband;	9
I	9
am	9
the	9
unfortunate	9
Cardenio,	9
whom	9
the	9
wrong-doing	9
of	9
him	9
who	9
has	9
brought	9
you	9
to	9
your	9
present	9
condition	9
has	9
reduced	9
to	9
the	9
state	9
you	9
see	9
me	9
in,	9
bare,	9
ragged,	9
bereft	9
of	9
all	9
human	9
comfort,	9
and	9
what	9
is	9
worse,	9
of	9
reason,	9
for	9
I	9
only	9
possess	9
it	9
when	9
Heaven	9
is	9
pleased	9
for	9
some	9
short	9
space	9
to	9
restore	9
it	9
to	9
me.	9
I,	9
Dorothea,	9
am	9
he	9
who	9
witnessed	9
the	9
wrong	9
done	9
by	9
Don	9
Fernando,	9
and	9
waited	9
to	9
hear	9
the	9
‘Yes’	9
uttered	9
by	9
which	9
Luscinda	9
owned	9
herself	9
his	9
betrothed:	9
I	9
am	9
he	9
who	9
had	9
not	9
courage	9
enough	9
to	9
see	9
how	9
her	9
fainting	9
fit	9
ended,	9
or	9
what	9
came	9
of	9
the	9
paper	9
that	9
was	9
found	9
in	9
her	9
bosom,	9
because	9
my	9
heart	9
had	9
not	9
the	9
fortitude	9
to	9
endure	9
so	9
many	9
strokes	9
of	9
ill-fortune	9
at	9
once;	9
and	9
so	9
losing	9
patience	9
I	9
quitted	9
the	9
house,	9
and	9
leaving	9
a	9
letter	9
with	9
my	9
host,	9
which	9
I	9
entreated	9
him	9
to	9
place	9
in	9
Luscinda’s	9
hands,	9
I	9
betook	9
myself	9
to	9
these	9
solitudes,	9
resolved	9
to	9
end	9
here	9
the	9
life	9
I	9
hated	9
as	9
if	9
it	9
were	9
my	9
mortal	9
enemy.	9
But	9
fate	9
would	9
not	9
rid	9
me	9
of	9
it,	9
contenting	9
itself	9
with	9
robbing	9
me	9
of	9
my	9
reason,	9
perhaps	9
to	9
preserve	9
me	9
for	9
the	9
good	9
fortune	9
I	9
have	9
had	9
in	9
meeting	9
you;	9
for	9
if	9
that	9
which	9
you	9
have	9
just	9
told	9
us	9
be	9
true,	9
as	9
I	9
believe	9
it	9
to	9
be,	9
it	9
may	9
be	9
that	9
Heaven	9
has	9
yet	9
in	9
store	9
for	9
both	9
of	9
us	9
a	9
happier	9
termination	9
to	9
our	9
misfortunes	9
than	9
we	9
look	9
for;	9
because	9
seeing	9
that	9
Luscinda	9
cannot	9
marry	9
Don	9
Fernando,	9
being	9
mine,	9
as	9
she	9
has	9
herself	9
so	9
openly	9
declared,	9
and	9
that	9
Don	9
Fernando	9
cannot	9
marry	9
her	9
as	9
he	9
is	9
yours,	9
we	9
may	9
reasonably	9
hope	9
that	9
Heaven	9
will	9
restore	9
to	9
us	9
what	9
is	9
ours,	9
as	9
it	9
is	9
still	9
in	9
existence	9
and	9
not	9
yet	9
alienated	9
or	9
destroyed.	9
And	9
as	9
we	9
have	9
this	9
consolation	9
springing	9
from	9
no	9
very	9
visionary	9
hope	9
or	9
wild	9
fancy,	9
I	9
entreat	9
you,	9
señora,	9
to	9
form	9
new	9
resolutions	9
in	9
your	9
better	9
mind,	9
as	9
I	9
mean	9
to	9
do	9
in	9
mine,	9
preparing	9
yourself	9
to	9
look	9
forward	9
to	9
happier	9
fortunes;	9
for	9
I	9
swear	9
to	9
you	9
by	9
the	9
faith	9
of	9
a	9
gentleman	9
and	9
a	9
Christian	9
not	9
to	9
desert	9
you	9
until	9
I	9
see	9
you	9
in	9
possession	9
of	9
Don	9
Fernando,	9
and	9
if	9
I	9
cannot	9
by	9
words	9
induce	9
him	9
to	9
recognise	9
his	9
obligation	9
to	9
you,	9
in	9
that	9
case	9
to	9
avail	9
myself	9
of	9
the	9
right	9
which	9
my	9
rank	9
as	9
a	9
gentleman	9
gives	9
me,	9
and	9
with	9
just	9
cause	9
challenge	9
him	9
on	9
account	9
of	9
the	9
injury	9
he	9
has	9
done	9
you,	9
not	9
regarding	9
my	9
own	9
wrongs,	9
which	9
I	9
shall	9
leave	9
to	9
Heaven	9
to	9
avenge,	9
while	9
I	9
on	9
earth	9
devote	9
myself	9
to	9
yours.”	9
Cardenio’s	9
words	9
completed	9
the	9
astonishment	9
of	9
Dorothea,	9
and	9
not	9
knowing	9
how	9
to	9
return	9
thanks	9
for	9
such	9
an	9
offer,	9
she	9
attempted	9
to	9
kiss	9
his	9
feet;	9
but	9
Cardenio	9
would	9
not	9
permit	9
it,	9
and	9
the	9
licentiate	9
replied	9
for	9
both,	9
commended	9
the	9
sound	9
reasoning	9
of	9
Cardenio,	9
and	9
lastly,	9
begged,	9
advised,	9
and	9
urged	9
them	9
to	9
come	9
with	9
him	9
to	9
his	9
village,	9
where	9
they	9
might	9
furnish	9
themselves	9
with	9
what	9
they	9
needed,	9
and	9
take	9
measures	9
to	9
discover	9
Don	9
Fernando,	9
or	9
restore	9
Dorothea	9
to	9
her	9
parents,	9
or	9
do	9
what	9
seemed	9
to	9
them	9
most	9
advisable.	9
Cardenio	9
and	9
Dorothea	9
thanked	9
him,	9
and	9
accepted	9
the	9
kind	9
offer	9
he	9
made	9
them;	9
and	9
the	9
barber,	9
who	9
had	9
been	9
listening	9
to	9
all	9
attentively	9
and	9
in	9
silence,	9
on	9
his	9
part	9
some	9
kindly	9
words	9
also,	9
and	9
with	9
no	9
less	9
good-will	9
than	9
the	9
curate	9
offered	9
his	9
services	9
in	9
any	9
way	9
that	9
might	9
be	9
of	9
use	9
to	9
them.	9
He	9
also	9
explained	9
to	9
them	9
in	9
a	9
few	9
words	9
the	9
object	9
that	9
had	9
brought	9
them	9
there,	9
and	9
the	9
strange	9
nature	9
of	9
Don	9
Quixote’s	9
madness,	9
and	9
how	9
they	9
were	9
waiting	9
for	9
his	9
squire,	9
who	9
had	9
gone	9
in	9
search	9
of	9
him.	9
Like	9
the	9
recollection	9
of	9
a	9
dream,	9
the	9
quarrel	9
he	9
had	10
with	10
Don	10
Quixote	10
came	10
back	10
to	10
Cardenio’s	10
memory,	10
and	10
he	10
described	10
it	10
to	10
the	10
others;	10
but	10
he	10
was	10
unable	10
to	10
say	10
what	10
the	10
dispute	10
was	10
about.	10

At	10
this	10
moment	10
they	10
heard	10
a	10
shout,	10
and	10
recognised	10
it	10
as	10
coming	10
from	10
Sancho	10
Panza,	10
who,	10
not	10
finding	10
them	10
where	10
he	10
had	10
left	10
them,	10
was	10
calling	10
aloud	10
to	10
them.	10
They	10
went	10
to	10
meet	10
him,	10
and	10
in	10
answer	10
to	10
their	10
inquiries	10
about	10
Don	10
Quixote,	10
he	10
told	10
them	10
how	10
he	10
had	10
found	10
him	10
stripped	10
to	10
his	10
shirt,	10
lank,	10
yellow,	10
half	10
dead	10
with	10
hunger,	10
and	10
sighing	10
for	10
his	10
lady	10
Dulcinea;	10
and	10
although	10
he	10
had	10
told	10
him	10
that	10
she	10
commanded	10
him	10
to	10
quit	10
that	10
place	10
and	10
come	10
to	10
El	10
Toboso,	10
where	10
she	10
was	10
expecting	10
him,	10
he	10
had	10
answered	10
that	10
he	10
was	10
determined	10
not	10
to	10
appear	10
in	10
the	10
presence	10
of	10
her	10
beauty	10
until	10
he	10
had	10
done	10
deeds	10
to	10
make	10
him	10
worthy	10
of	10
her	10
favour;	10
and	10
if	10
this	10
went	10
on,	10
Sancho	10
said,	10
he	10
ran	10
the	10
risk	10
of	10
not	10
becoming	10
an	10
emperor	10
as	10
in	10
duty	10
bound,	10
or	10
even	10
an	10
archbishop,	10
which	10
was	10
the	10
least	10
he	10
could	10
be;	10
for	10
which	10
reason	10
they	10
ought	10
to	10
consider	10
what	10
was	10
to	10
be	10
done	10
to	10
get	10
him	10
away	10
from	10
there.	10
The	10
licentiate	10
in	10
reply	10
told	10
him	10
not	10
to	10
be	10
uneasy,	10
for	10
they	10
would	10
fetch	10
him	10
away	10
in	10
spite	10
of	10
himself.	10
He	10
then	10
told	10
Cardenio	10
and	10
Dorothea	10
what	10
they	10
had	10
proposed	10
to	10
do	10
to	10
cure	10
Don	10
Quixote,	10
or	10
at	10
any	10
rate	10
take	10
him	10
home;	10
upon	10
which	10
Dorothea	10
said	10
that	10
she	10
could	10
play	10
the	10
distressed	10
damsel	10
better	10
than	10
the	10
barber;	10
especially	10
as	10
she	10
had	10
there	10
the	10
dress	10
in	10
which	10
to	10
do	10
it	10
to	10
the	10
life,	10
and	10
that	10
they	10
might	10
trust	10
to	10
her	10
acting	10
the	10
part	10
in	10
every	10
particular	10
requisite	10
for	10
carrying	10
out	10
their	10
scheme,	10
for	10
she	10
had	10
read	10
a	10
great	10
many	10
books	10
of	10
chivalry,	10
and	10
knew	10
exactly	10
the	10
style	10
in	10
which	10
afflicted	10
damsels	10
begged	10
boons	10
of	10
knights-errant.	10
“In	10
that	10
case,”	10
said	10
the	10
curate,	10
“there	10
is	10
nothing	10
more	10
required	10
than	10
to	10
set	10
about	10
it	10
at	10
once,	10
for	10
beyond	10
a	10
doubt	10
fortune	10
is	10
declaring	10
itself	10
in	10
our	10
favour,	10
since	10
it	10
has	10
so	10
unexpectedly	10
begun	10
to	10
open	10
a	10
door	10
for	10
your	10
relief,	10
and	10
smoothed	10
the	10
way	10
for	10
us	10
to	10
our	10
object.”	10
Dorothea	10
then	10
took	10
out	10
of	10
her	10
pillow-case	10
a	10
complete	10
petticoat	10
of	10
some	10
rich	10
stuff,	10
and	10
a	10
green	10
mantle	10
of	10
some	10
other	10
fine	10
material,	10
and	10
a	10
necklace	10
and	10
other	10
ornaments	10
out	10
of	10
a	10
little	10
box,	10
and	10
with	10
these	10
in	10
an	10
instant	10
she	10
so	10
arrayed	10
herself	10
that	10
she	10
looked	10
like	10
a	10
great	10
and	10
rich	10
lady.	10
All	10
this,	10
and	10
more,	10
she	10
said,	10
she	10
had	10
taken	10
from	10
home	10
in	10
case	10
of	10
need,	10
but	10
that	10
until	10
then	10
she	10
had	11
no	11
occasion	11
to	11
make	11
use	11
of	11
it.	11
They	11
were	11
all	11
highly	11
delighted	11
with	11
her	11
grace,	11
air,	11
and	11
beauty,	11
and	11
declared	11
Don	11
Fernando	11
to	11
be	11
a	11
man	11
of	11
very	11
little	11
taste	11
when	11
he	11
rejected	11
such	11
charms.	11
But	11
the	11
one	11
who	11
admired	11
her	11
most	11
was	11
Sancho	11
Panza,	11
for	11
it	11
seemed	11
to	11
him	11
(what	11
indeed	11
was	11
true)	11
that	11
in	11
all	11
the	11
days	11
of	11
his	11
life	11
he	11
had	11
never	11
seen	11
such	11
a	11
lovely	11
creature;	11
and	11
he	11
asked	11
the	11
curate	11
with	11
great	11
eagerness	11
who	11
this	11
beautiful	11
lady	11
was,	11
and	11
what	11
she	11
wanted	11
in	11
these	11
out-of-the-way	11
quarters.	11
“This	11
fair	11
lady,	11
brother	11
Sancho,”	11
replied	11
the	11
curate,	11
“is	11
no	11
less	11
a	11
personage	11
than	11
the	11
heiress	11
in	11
the	11
direct	11
male	11
line	11
of	11
the	11
great	11
kingdom	11
of	11
Micomicon,	11
who	11
has	11
come	11
in	11
search	11
of	11
your	11
master	11
to	11
beg	11
a	11
boon	11
of	11
him,	11
which	11
is	11
that	11
he	11
redress	11
a	11
wrong	11
or	11
injury	11
that	11
a	11
wicked	11
giant	11
has	11
done	11
her;	11
and	11
from	11
the	11
fame	11
as	11
a	11
good	11
knight	11
which	11
your	11
master	11
has	11
acquired	11
far	11
and	11
wide,	11
this	11
princess	11
has	11
come	11
from	11
Guinea	11
to	11
seek	11
him.”	11
“A	11
lucky	11
seeking	11
and	11
a	11
lucky	11
finding!”	11
said	11
Sancho	11
Panza	11
at	11
this;	11
“especially	11
if	11
my	11
master	11
has	11
the	11
good	11
fortune	11
to	11
redress	11
that	11
injury,	11
and	11
right	11
that	11
wrong,	11
and	11
kill	11
that	11
son	11
of	11
a	11
bitch	11
of	11
a	11
giant	11
your	11
worship	11
speaks	11
of;	11
as	11
kill	11
him	11
he	11
will	11
if	11
he	11
meets	11
him,	11
unless,	11
indeed,	11
he	11
happens	11
to	11
be	11
a	11
phantom;	11
for	11
my	11
master	11
has	11
no	11
power	11
at	11
all	11
against	11
phantoms.	11
But	11
one	11
thing	11
among	11
others	11
I	11
would	11
beg	11
of	11
you,	11
señor	11
licentiate,	11
which	11
is,	11
that,	11
to	11
prevent	11
my	11
master	11
taking	11
a	11
fancy	11
to	11
be	11
an	11
archbishop,	11
for	11
that	11
is	11
what	11
I’m	11
afraid	11
of,	11
your	11
worship	11
would	11
recommend	11
him	11
to	11
marry	11
this	11
princess	11
at	11
once;	11
for	11
in	11
this	11
way	11
he	11
will	11
be	11
disabled	11
from	11
taking	11
archbishop’s	11
orders,	11
and	11
will	11
easily	11
come	11
into	11
his	11
empire,	11
and	11
I	11
to	11
the	11
end	11
of	11
my	11
desires;	11
I	11
have	11
been	11
thinking	11
over	11
the	11
matter	11
carefully,	11
and	11
by	11
what	11
I	11
can	11
make	11
out	11
I	11
find	11
it	11
will	11
not	11
do	11
for	11
me	11
that	11
my	11
master	11
should	11
become	11
an	11
archbishop,	11
because	11
I	11
am	11
no	11
good	11
for	11
the	11
Church,	11
as	11
I	11
am	11
married;	11
and	11
for	11
me	11
now,	11
having	11
as	11
I	11
have	11
a	11
wife	11
and	11
children,	11
to	11
set	11
about	11
obtaining	11
dispensations	11
to	11
enable	11
me	11
to	11
hold	11
a	11
place	11
of	11
profit	11
under	11
the	11
Church,	11
would	11
be	11
endless	11
work;	11
so	11
that,	11
señor,	11
it	11
all	11
turns	11
on	11
my	11
master	11
marrying	11
this	11
lady	11
at	11
once—for	11
as	11
yet	11
I	11
do	11
not	11
know	11
her	11
grace,	11
and	11
so	11
I	11
cannot	11
call	11
her	11
by	11
her	11
name.”	11
“She	11
is	11
called	11
the	11
Princess	11
Micomicona,”	11
said	11
the	11
curate;	11
“for	11
as	11
her	11
kingdom	11
is	11
Micomicon,	11
it	11
is	11
clear	11
that	11
must	11
be	11
her	11
name.”	11
“There’s	11
no	11
doubt	11
of	11
that,”	11
replied	11
Sancho,	11
“for	11
I	11
have	11
known	11
many	11
to	11
take	11
their	11
name	11
and	11
title	11
from	11
the	11
place	11
where	11
they	11
were	11
born	11
and	11
call	11
themselves	11
Pedro	11
of	11
Alcalá,	11
Juan	11
of	11
Úbeda,	11
and	11
Diego	11
of	11
Valladolid;	11
and	11
it	11
may	11
be	11
that	11
over	11
there	11
in	11
Guinea	11
queens	11
have	11
the	11
same	11
way	11
of	11
taking	11
the	11
names	11
of	11
their	11
kingdoms.”	11
“So	11
it	11
may,”	11
said	11
the	11
curate;	11
“and	11
as	11
for	11
your	11
master’s	11
marrying,	11
I	11
will	11
do	11
all	11
in	11
my	11
power	11
towards	11
it:”	11
with	11
which	11
Sancho	11
was	11
as	11
much	11
pleased	11
as	11
the	11
curate	11
was	11
amazed	11
at	11
his	11
simplicity	11
and	11
at	11
seeing	11
what	11
a	11
hold	11
the	11
absurdities	11
of	11
his	11
master	11
had	11
taken	11
of	11
his	11
fancy,	11
for	11
he	11
had	11
evidently	11
persuaded	11
himself	11
that	11
he	11
was	11
going	11
to	11
be	11
an	11
emperor.	11
By	11
this	11
time	11
Dorothea	11
had	11
seated	11
herself	11
upon	11
the	11
curate’s	11
mule,	11
and	11
the	11
barber	11
had	11
fitted	11
the	11
ox-tail	11
beard	11
to	11
his	11
face,	11
and	11
they	11
now	11
told	11
Sancho	11
to	11
conduct	11
them	11
to	11
where	11
Don	11
Quixote	11
was,	11
warning	11
him	11
not	11
to	11
say	11
that	11
he	11
knew	11
either	11
the	11
licentiate	11
or	11
the	11
barber,	11
as	11
his	11
master’s	11
becoming	11
an	11
emperor	11
entirely	11
depended	11
on	11
his	11
not	11
recognising	11
them;	11
neither	11
the	11
curate	11
nor	11
Cardenio,	11
however,	11
thought	11
fit	11
to	11
go	11
with	11
them;	11
Cardenio	11
lest	11
he	11
should	11
remind	11
Don	11
Quixote	11
of	11
the	11
quarrel	11
he	11
had	11
with	11
him,	11
and	11
the	11
curate	11
as	11
there	11
was	11
no	11
necessity	11
for	11
his	11
presence	11
just	11
yet,	11
so	11
they	11
allowed	11
the	11
others	11
to	11
go	11
on	11
before	11
them,	11
while	11
they	11
themselves	11
followed	11
slowly	11
on	11
foot.	11
The	11
curate	11
did	11
not	11
forget	11
to	11
instruct	11
Dorothea	11
how	11
to	11
act,	11
but	11
she	11
said	11
they	11
might	11
make	11
their	11
minds	11
easy,	11
as	11
everything	11
would	11
be	11
done	11
exactly	11
as	11
the	11
books	11
of	11
chivalry	11
required	11
and	11
described.	11

They	11
had	11
gone	11
about	11
three-quarters	11
of	11
a	11
league	11
when	11
they	11
discovered	11
Don	11
Quixote	11
in	11
a	11
wilderness	11
of	11
rocks,	11
by	11
this	11
time	11
clothed,	11
but	11
without	11
his	11
armour;	11
and	11
as	11
soon	11
as	11
Dorothea	11
saw	11
him	11
and	11
was	11
told	11
by	11
Sancho	11
that	12
was	12
Don	12
Quixote,	12
she	12
whipped	12
her	12
palfrey,	12
the	12
well-bearded	12
barber	12
following	12
her,	12
and	12
on	12
coming	12
up	12
to	12
him	12
her	12
squire	12
sprang	12
from	12
his	12
mule	12
and	12
came	12
forward	12
to	12
receive	12
her	12
in	12
his	12
arms,	12
and	12
she	12
dismounting	12
with	12
great	12
ease	12
of	12
manner	12
advanced	12
to	12
kneel	12
before	12
the	12
feet	12
of	12
Don	12
Quixote;	12
and	12
though	12
he	12
strove	12
to	12
raise	12
her	12
up,	12
she	12
without	12
rising	12
addressed	12
him	12
in	12
this	12
fashion:	12
“From	12
this	12
spot	12
I	12
will	12
not	12
rise,	12
valiant	12
and	12
doughty	12
knight,	12
until	12
your	12
goodness	12
and	12
courtesy	12
grant	12
me	12
a	12
boon,	12
which	12
will	12
redound	12
to	12
the	12
honour	12
and	12
renown	12
of	12
your	12
person	12
and	12
render	12
a	12
service	12
to	12
the	12
most	12
disconsolate	12
and	12
afflicted	12
damsel	12
the	12
sun	12
has	12
seen;	12
and	12
if	12
the	12
might	12
of	12
your	12
strong	12
arm	12
corresponds	12
to	12
the	12
repute	12
of	12
your	12
immortal	12
fame,	12
you	12
are	12
bound	12
to	12
aid	12
the	12
helpless	12
being	12
who,	12
led	12
by	12
the	12
savour	12
of	12
your	12
renowned	12
name,	12
hath	12
come	12
from	12
far	12
distant	12
lands	12
to	12
seek	12
your	12
aid	12
in	12
her	12
misfortunes.”	12
“I	12
will	12
not	12
answer	12
a	12
word,	12
beauteous	12
lady,”	12
replied	12
Don	12
Quixote,	12
“nor	12
will	12
I	12
listen	12
to	12
anything	12
further	12
concerning	12
you,	12
until	12
you	12
rise	12
from	12
the	12
earth.”	12
“I	12
will	12
not	12
rise,	12
señor,”	12
answered	12
the	12
afflicted	12
damsel,	12
“unless	12
of	12
your	12
courtesy	12
the	12
boon	12
I	12
ask	12
is	12
first	12
granted	12
me.”	12
“I	12
grant	12
and	12
accord	12
it,”	12
said	12
Don	12
Quixote,	12
“provided	12
without	12
detriment	12
or	12
prejudice	12
to	12
my	12
king,	12
my	12
country,	12
or	12
her	12
who	12
holds	12
the	12
key	12
of	12
my	12
heart	12
and	12
freedom,	12
it	12
may	12
be	12
complied	12
with.”	12
“It	12
will	12
not	12
be	12
to	12
the	12
detriment	12
or	12
prejudice	12
of	12
any	12
of	12
them,	12
my	12
worthy	12
lord,”	12
said	12
the	12
afflicted	12
damsel;	12
and	12
here	12
Sancho	12
Panza	12
drew	12
close	12
to	12
his	12
master’s	12
ear	12
and	12
said	12
to	12
him	12
very	12
softly,	12
“Your	12
worship	12
may	12
very	12
safely	12
grant	12
the	12
boon	12
she	12
asks;	12
it’s	12
nothing	12
at	12
all;	12
only	12
to	12
kill	12
a	12
big	12
giant;	12
and	12
she	12
who	12
asks	12
it	12
is	12
the	12
exalted	12
Princess	12
Micomicona,	12
queen	12
of	12
the	12
great	12
kingdom	12
of	12
Micomicon	12
of	12
Ethiopia.”	12
“Let	12
her	12
be	12
who	12
she	12
may,”	12
replied	12
Don	12
Quixote,	12
“I	12
will	12
do	12
what	12
is	12
my	12
bounden	12
duty,	12
and	12
what	12
my	12
conscience	12
bids	12
me,	12
in	12
conformity	12
with	12
what	12
I	12
have	12
professed;”	12
and	12
turning	12
to	12
the	12
damsel	12
he	12
said,	12
“Let	12
your	12
great	12
beauty	12
rise,	12
for	12
I	12
grant	12
the	12
boon	12
which	12
you	12
would	12
ask	12
of	12
me.”	12
“Then	12
what	12
I	12
ask,”	12
said	12
the	12
damsel,	12
“is	12
that	12
your	12
magnanimous	12
person	12
accompany	12
me	12
at	12
once	12
whither	12
I	12
will	12
conduct	12
you,	12
and	12
that	12
you	12
promise	12
not	12
to	12
engage	12
in	12
any	12
other	12
adventure	12
or	12
quest	12
until	12
you	12
have	12
avenged	12
me	12
of	12
a	12
traitor	12
who	12
against	12
all	12
human	12
and	12
divine	12
law,	12
has	12
usurped	12
my	12
kingdom.”	12
“I	12
repeat	12
that	12
I	12
grant	12
it,”	12
replied	12
Don	12
Quixote;	12
“and	12
so,	12
lady,	12
you	12
may	12
from	12
this	12
day	12
forth	12
lay	12
aside	12
the	12
melancholy	12
that	12
distresses	12
you,	12
and	12
let	12
your	12
failing	12
hopes	12
gather	12
new	12
life	12
and	12
strength,	12
for	12
with	12
the	12
help	12
of	12
God	12
and	12
of	12
my	12
arm	12
you	12
will	12
soon	12
see	12
yourself	12
restored	12
to	12
your	12
kingdom,	12
and	12
seated	12
upon	12
the	12
throne	12
of	12
your	12
ancient	12
and	12
mighty	12
realm,	12
notwithstanding	12
and	12
despite	12
of	12
the	12
felons	12
who	12
would	12
gainsay	12
it;	12
and	12
now	12
hands	12
to	12
the	12
work,	12
for	12
in	12
delay	12
there	12
is	12
apt	12
to	12
be	12
danger.”	12
The	12
distressed	12
damsel	12
strove	12
with	12
much	12
pertinacity	12
to	12
kiss	12
his	12
hands;	12
but	12
Don	12
Quixote,	12
who	12
was	12
in	12
all	12
things	12
a	12
polished	12
and	12
courteous	12
knight,	12
would	12
by	12
no	12
means	12
allow	12
it,	12
but	12
made	12
her	12
rise	12
and	12
embraced	12
her	12
with	12
great	12
courtesy	12
and	12
politeness,	12
and	12
ordered	12
Sancho	12
to	12
look	12
to	12
Rocinante’s	12
girths,	12
and	12
to	12
arm	12
him	12
without	12
a	12
moment’s	12
delay.	12
Sancho	12
took	12
down	12
the	12
armour,	12
which	12
was	12
hung	12
up	12
on	12
a	12
tree	12
like	12
a	12
trophy,	12
and	12
having	12
seen	12
to	12
the	12
girths	12
armed	12
his	12
master	12
in	12
a	12
trice,	12
who	12
as	12
soon	12
as	12
he	12
found	12
himself	12
in	12
his	12
armour	12
exclaimed:	12
“Let	12
us	12
be	12
gone	12
in	12
the	12
name	12
of	12
God	12
to	12
bring	12
aid	12
to	12
this	12
great	12
lady.”	12
The	12
barber	12
was	12
all	12
this	12
time	12
on	12
his	12
knees	12
at	12
great	12
pains	12
to	12
hide	12
his	12
laughter	12
and	12
not	12
let	12
his	12
beard	12
fall,	12
for	12
had	12
it	12
fallen	12
maybe	12
their	12
fine	12
scheme	12
would	12
have	12
come	12
to	12
nothing;	12
but	12
now	12
seeing	12
the	12
boon	12
granted,	12
and	12
the	12
promptitude	12
with	12
which	12
Don	12
Quixote	12
prepared	12
to	12
set	12
out	12
in	12
compliance	12
with	12
it,	12
he	12
rose	12
and	12
took	12
his	12
lady’s	12
hand,	12
and	12
between	12
them	12
they	12
placed	12
her	12
upon	12
the	12
mule.	12
Don	12
Quixote	12
then	12
mounted	12
Rocinante,	12
and	12
the	12
barber	12
settled	12
himself	12
on	12
his	12
beast,	12
Sancho	12
being	12
left	12
to	12
go	12
on	12
foot,	12
which	12
made	12
him	12
feel	12
anew	12
the	12
loss	12
of	12
his	12
Dapple,	12
finding	12
the	12
want	12
of	12
him	12
now.	12
But	12
he	12
bore	12
all	12
with	12
cheerfulness,	12
being	12
persuaded	12
that	12
his	12
master	12
had	12
now	12
fairly	12
started	12
and	12
was	12
just	12
on	12
the	12
point	12
of	12
becoming	12
an	12
emperor;	12
for	12
he	12
felt	12
no	12
doubt	12
at	12
all	12
that	12
he	12
would	12
marry	12
this	12
princess,	12
and	12
be	12
king	12
of	12
Micomicon	12
at	12
least.	12
The	12
only	12
thing	12
that	12
troubled	12
him	12
was	12
the	12
reflection	12
that	12
this	12
kingdom	12
was	12
in	12
the	12
land	12
of	12
the	12
blacks,	12
and	12
that	12
the	12
people	12
they	12
would	12
give	12
him	12
for	12
vassals	12
would	12
be	12
all	12
black;	12
but	12
for	12
this	12
he	12
soon	12
found	12
a	12
remedy	12
in	12
his	12
fancy,	12
and	12
said	12
he	12
to	12
himself,	12
“What	12
is	12
it	12
to	12
me	12
if	12
my	12
vassals	12
are	12
blacks?	12
What	12
more	12
have	12
I	12
to	12
do	12
than	12
make	12
a	12
cargo	12
of	12
them	12
and	12
carry	12
them	12
to	12
Spain,	12
where	12
I	12
can	12
sell	12
them	12
and	12
get	12
ready	12
money	12
for	12
them,	12
and	12
with	12
it	12
buy	12
some	12
title	12
or	12
some	12
office	12
in	12
which	12
to	12
live	12
at	12
ease	12
all	12
the	12
days	12
of	12
my	12
life?	12
Not	12
unless	12
you	12
go	12
to	12
sleep	12
and	12
haven’t	12
the	12
wit	12
or	12
skill	12
to	12
turn	12
things	12
to	12
account	12
and	12
sell	12
three,	12
six,	12
or	12
ten	12
thousand	12
vassals	12
while	12
you	12
would	12
be	12
talking	12
about	12
it!	12
By	12
God	12
I	12
will	12
stir	12
them	12
up,	12
big	12
and	12
little,	12
or	12
as	12
best	12
I	12
can,	12
and	12
let	12
them	12
be	12
ever	12
so	12
black	12
I’ll	12
turn	12
them	12
into	12
white	12
or	12
yellow.	12
Come,	12
come,	12
what	12
a	12
fool	12
I	12
am!”	12
And	12
so	12
he	12
jogged	12
on,	12
so	12
occupied	12
with	12
his	12
thoughts	12
and	12
easy	12
in	12
his	12
mind	12
that	12
he	12
forgot	12
all	12
about	12
the	12
hardship	12
of	12
travelling	12
on	12
foot.	12
Cardenio	12
and	12
the	12
curate	12
were	12
watching	12
all	12
this	12
from	12
among	12
some	12
bushes,	12
not	12
knowing	12
how	12
to	12
join	12
company	12
with	12
the	12
others;	12
but	12
the	12
curate,	12
who	12
was	12
very	12
fertile	12
in	12
devices,	12
soon	12
hit	12
upon	12
a	12
way	12
of	12
effecting	12
their	12
purpose,	12
and	12
with	12
a	12
pair	12
of	12
scissors	12
he	12
had	12
in	12
a	12
case	12
he	12
quickly	12
cut	12
off	12
Cardenio’s	12
beard,	12
and	12
putting	12
on	12
him	12
a	12
grey	12
jerkin	12
of	12
his	12
own	12
he	12
gave	12
him	12
a	12
black	12
cloak,	12
leaving	12
himself	12
in	12
his	12
breeches	12
and	12
doublet,	12
while	12
Cardenio’s	12
appearance	12
was	12
so	12
different	12
from	12
what	12
it	12
had	12
been	12
that	12
he	12
would	12
not	12
have	12
known	12
himself	12
had	12
he	12
seen	12
himself	12
in	12
a	12
mirror.	12
Having	12
effected	12
this,	12
although	12
the	12
others	12
had	12
gone	12
on	12
ahead	12
while	12
they	12
were	12
disguising	12
themselves,	12
they	12
easily	12
came	12
out	12
on	12
the	12
high	12
road	12
before	12
them,	12
for	12
the	12
brambles	12
and	12
awkward	12
places	12
they	12
encountered	12
did	12
not	12
allow	12
those	12
on	12
horseback	12
to	12
go	12
as	12
fast	12
as	12
those	12
on	12
foot.	12
They	12
then	12
posted	12
themselves	12
on	12
the	12
level	12
ground	12
at	12
the	12
outlet	12
of	12
the	12
Sierra,	12
and	12
as	12
soon	12
as	12
Don	12
Quixote	12
and	12
his	12
companions	12
emerged	12
from	12
it	12
the	12
curate	12
began	12
to	12
examine	12
him	12
very	12
deliberately,	12
as	12
though	12
he	12
were	12
striving	12
to	12
recognise	12
him,	12
and	12
after	12
having	12
stared	12
at	12
him	12
for	12
some	12
time	12
he	12
hastened	12
towards	12
him	12
with	12
open	12
arms	12
exclaiming,	12
“A	12
happy	12
meeting	12
with	12
the	12
mirror	12
of	12
chivalry,	12
my	12
worthy	12
compatriot	12
Don	12
Quixote	12
of	12
La	12
Mancha,	12
the	12
flower	12
and	12
cream	12
of	12
high	12
breeding,	12
the	12
protection	12
and	12
relief	12
of	12
the	12
distressed,	12
the	12
quintessence	12
of	12
knights-errant!”	12
And	12
so	12
saying	12
he	12
clasped	12
in	12
his	12
arms	12
the	12
knee	12
of	12
Don	12
Quixote’s	12
left	12
leg.	12
He,	12
astonished	12
at	12
the	12
stranger’s	12
words	12
and	12
behaviour,	12
looked	12
at	12
him	12
attentively,	12
and	12
at	12
length	12
recognised	12
him,	12
very	12
much	12
surprised	12
to	12
see	12
him	12
there,	12
and	12
made	12
great	12
efforts	12
to	12
dismount.	12
This,	12
however,	12
the	12
curate	12
would	12
not	12
allow,	12
on	12
which	12
Don	12
Quixote	12
said,	12
“Permit	12
me,	12
señor	12
licentiate,	12
for	12
it	12
is	12
not	12
fitting	12
that	12
I	12
should	12
be	12
on	12
horseback	12
and	12
so	12
reverend	12
a	12
person	12
as	12
your	12
worship	12
on	12
foot.”	12
“On	12
no	12
account	12
will	12
I	12
allow	12
it,”	12
said	12
the	12
curate;	12
“your	12
mightiness	12
must	12
remain	12
on	12
horseback,	12
for	12
it	12
is	12
on	12
horseback	12
you	12
achieve	12
the	12
greatest	12
deeds	12
and	12
adventures	12
that	12
have	12
been	12
beheld	12
in	12
our	12
age;	12
as	12
for	12
me,	12
an	12
unworthy	12
priest,	12
it	12
will	12
serve	12
me	12
well	12
enough	12
to	12
mount	12
on	12
the	12
haunches	12
of	12
one	12
of	12
the	12
mules	12
of	12
these	12
gentlefolk	12
who	12
accompany	12
your	12
worship,	12
if	12
they	12
have	12
no	12
objection,	12
and	12
I	12
will	12
fancy	12
I	12
am	12
mounted	12
on	12
the	12
steed	12
Pegasus,	12
or	12
on	12
the	12
zebra	12
or	12
charger	12
that	12
bore	12
the	12
famous	12
Moor,	12
Muzaraque,	12
who	12
to	12
this	12
day	12
lies	12
enchanted	12
in	12
the	12
great	12
hill	12
of	12
Zulema,	12
a	12
little	12
distance	12
from	12
the	12
great	12
Complutum.”	12
“Nor	12
even	12
that	12
will	12
I	12
consent	12
to,	12
señor	12
licentiate,”	12
answered	12
Don	12
Quixote,	12
“and	12
I	12
know	12
it	12
will	12
be	12
the	12
good	12
pleasure	12
of	12
my	12
lady	12
the	12
princess,	12
out	12
of	12
love	12
for	12
me,	12
to	12
order	12
her	12
squire	12
to	12
give	12
up	12
the	12
saddle	12
of	12
his	12
mule	12
to	12
your	12
worship,	12
and	12
he	12
can	12
sit	12
behind	12
if	12
the	12
beast	12
will	12
bear	12
it.”	12
“It	12
will,	12
I	12
am	12
sure,”	12
said	12
the	12
princess,	12
“and	12
I	12
am	12
sure,	12
too,	12
that	12
I	12
need	12
not	12
order	12
my	12
squire,	12
for	12
he	12
is	12
too	12
courteous	12
and	12
considerate	12
to	12
allow	12
a	12
Churchman	12
to	12
go	12
on	12
foot	12
when	12
he	12
might	12
be	12
mounted.”	12
“That	12
he	12
is,”	12
said	12
the	12
barber,	12
and	12
at	12
once	12
alighting,	12
he	12
offered	12
his	12
saddle	12
to	12
the	12
curate,	12
who	12
accepted	12
it	12
without	12
much	12
entreaty;	12
but	12
unfortunately	12
as	12
the	12
barber	12
was	12
mounting	12
behind,	12
the	12
mule,	12
being	12
as	12
it	12
happened	12
a	12
hired	12
one,	12
which	12
is	12
the	12
same	12
thing	12
as	12
saying	12
ill-conditioned,	12
lifted	12
its	12
hind	12
hoofs	12
and	12
let	12
fly	12
a	12
couple	12
of	12
kicks	12
in	12
the	12
air,	12
which	12
would	12
have	12
made	12
Master	12
Nicholas	12
wish	12
his	12
expedition	12
in	12
quest	12
of	12
Don	12
Quixote	12
at	12
the	12
devil	12
had	12
they	12
caught	12
him	12
on	12
the	12
breast	12
or	12
head.	12
As	12
it	12
was,	12
they	12
so	12
took	12
him	12
by	12
surprise	12
that	12
he	12
came	12
to	12
the	12
ground,	12
giving	12
so	12
little	12
heed	12
to	12
his	12
beard	12
that	12
it	12
fell	12
off,	12
and	12
all	12
he	12
could	12
do	12
when	12
he	12
found	12
himself	12
without	12
it	12
was	12
to	12
cover	12
his	12
face	12
hastily	12
with	12
both	12
his	12
hands	12
and	12
moan	12
that	12
his	12
teeth	12
were	12
knocked	12
out.	12
Don	12
Quixote	12
when	12
he	12
saw	12
all	12
that	12
bundle	12
of	12
beard	12
detached,	12
without	12
jaws	12
or	12
blood,	12
from	12
the	12
face	12
of	12
the	12
fallen	12
squire,	12
exclaimed:	12
“By	12
the	12
living	12
God,	12
but	12
this	12
is	12
a	12
great	12
miracle!	12
it	12
has	12
knocked	12
off	12
and	12
plucked	12
away	12
the	12
beard	12
from	12
his	12
face	12
as	12
if	12
it	12
had	12
been	12
shaved	12
off	12
designedly.”	12
The	12
curate,	12
seeing	12
the	12
danger	12
of	12
discovery	12
that	12
threatened	12
his	12
scheme,	12
at	12
once	12
pounced	12
upon	12
the	12
beard	12
and	12
hastened	12
with	12
it	12
to	12
where	12
Master	12
Nicholas	12
lay,	12
still	12
uttering	12
moans,	12
and	12
drawing	12
his	12
head	12
to	12
his	12
breast	12
had	12
it	12
on	12
in	12
an	12
instant,	12
muttering	12
over	12
him	12
some	12
words	12
which	12
he	12
said	12
were	12
a	12
certain	12
special	12
charm	12
for	12
sticking	12
on	12
beards,	12
as	12
they	12
would	12
see;	12
and	12
as	12
soon	12
as	12
he	12
had	12
it	12
fixed	12
he	12
left	12
him,	12
and	12
the	12
squire	12
appeared	12
well	12
bearded	12
and	12
whole	12
as	12
before,	12
whereat	12
Don	12
Quixote	12
was	12
beyond	12
measure	12
astonished,	12
and	12
begged	12
the	12
curate	12
to	12
teach	12
him	12
that	12
charm	12
when	12
he	12
had	12
an	12
opportunity,	12
as	12
he	12
was	12
persuaded	12
its	12
virtue	12
must	12
extend	12
beyond	12
the	12
sticking	12
on	12
of	12
beards,	12
for	12
it	12
was	12
clear	12
that	12
where	12
the	12
beard	12
had	12
been	12
stripped	12
off	12
the	12
flesh	12
must	12
have	12
remained	12
torn	12
and	12
lacerated,	12
and	12
when	12
it	12
could	12
heal	12
all	12
that	12
it	12
must	12
be	12
good	12
for	12
more	12
than	12
beards.	12
“And	12
so	12
it	12
is,”	12
said	12
the	12
curate,	12
and	12
he	12
promised	12
to	12
teach	12
it	12
to	12
him	12
on	12
the	12
first	12
opportunity.	12
They	12
then	12
agreed	12
that	12
for	12
the	12
present	12
the	12
curate	12
should	12
mount,	12
and	12
that	12
the	12
three	12
should	12
ride	12
by	12
turns	12
until	12
they	12
reached	12
the	12
inn,	12
which	12
might	12
be	12
about	12
six	12
leagues	12
from	12
where	12
they	12
were.	12
Three	12
then	12
being	12
mounted,	12
that	12
is	12
to	12
say,	12
Don	12
Quixote,	12
the	12
princess,	12
and	12
the	12
curate,	12
and	12
three	12
on	12
foot,	12
Cardenio,	12
the	12
barber,	12
and	12
Sancho	12
Panza,	12
Don	12
Quixote	12
said	12
to	12
the	12
damsel:	12
“Let	12
your	12
highness,	12
lady,	12
lead	12
on	12
whithersoever	12
is	12
most	12
pleasing	12
to	12
you;”	12
but	12
before	12
she	12
could	12
answer	12
the	12
licentiate	12
said:	12

“Towards	12
what	12
kingdom	12
would	12
your	12
ladyship	12
direct	12
our	12
course?	12
Is	12
it	12
perchance	12
towards	12
that	12
of	12
Micomicon?	12
It	12
must	12
be,	12
or	12
else	12
I	12
know	12
little	12
about	12
kingdoms.”	12
She,	12
being	12
ready	12
on	12
all	12
points,	12
understood	12
that	12
she	12
was	12
to	12
answer	12
“Yes,”	12
so	12
she	12
said	12
“Yes,	12
señor,	12
my	12
way	12
lies	12
towards	12
that	12
kingdom.”	12
“In	12
that	12
case,”	12
said	12
the	12
curate,	12
“we	12
must	12
pass	12
right	12
through	12
my	12
village,	12
and	12
there	12
your	12
worship	12
will	12
take	12
the	12
road	12
to	12
Cartagena,	12
where	12
you	12
will	12
be	12
able	12
to	12
embark,	12
fortune	12
favouring;	12
and	12
if	12
the	12
wind	12
be	12
fair	12
and	12
the	12
sea	12
smooth	12
and	12
tranquil,	12
in	12
somewhat	12
less	12
than	12
nine	12
years	12
you	12
may	12
come	12

“Your	12
worship	12
is	12
mistaken,	12
señor,”	12
said	12
she;	12
“for	12
it	12
is	12
not	12
two	12
years	12
since	12
I	12
set	12
out	12
from	12
it,	12
and	12
though	12
I	12
never	12
had	12
good	12
weather,	12
nevertheless	12
I	12
am	12
here	12
to	12
behold	12
what	12
I	12
so	12
longed	12
for,	12
and	12
that	12
is	12
my	12
lord	12
Don	12
Quixote	12
of	12
La	12
Mancha,	12
whose	12
fame	12
came	12
to	12
my	12
ears	12
as	12
soon	12
as	12
I	12
set	12
foot	12
in	12
Spain	12
and	12
impelled	12
me	12
to	12
go	12
in	12
search	12
of	12
him,	12
to	12
commend	12
myself	12
to	12
his	12
courtesy,	12
and	12
entrust	12
the	12
justice	12
of	12
my	12
cause	12
to	12
the	12
might	12
of	12
his	12
invincible	12
arm.”	12
“Enough;	12
no	12
more	12
praise,”	12
said	12
Don	12
Quixote	12
at	12
this,	12
“for	12
I	12
hate	12
all	12
flattery;	12
and	12
though	12
this	12
may	12
not	12
be	12
so,	12
still	12
language	12
of	12
the	12
kind	12
is	12
offensive	12
to	12
my	12
chaste	12
ears.	12
I	12
will	12
only	12
say,	12
señora,	12
that	12
whether	12
it	12
has	12
might	12
or	12
not,	12
that	12
which	12
it	12
may	12
or	12
may	12
not	12
have	12
shall	12
be	12
devoted	12
to	12
your	12
service	12
even	12
to	12
death;	12
and	12
now,	12
leaving	12
this	12
to	12
its	12
proper	12
season,	12
I	12
would	12
ask	12
the	12
señor	12
licentiate	12
to	12
tell	12
me	12
what	12
it	12
is	12
that	12
has	12
brought	12
him	12
into	12
these	12
parts,	12
alone,	12
unattended,	12
and	12
so	12
lightly	12
clad	12
that	12
I	12
am	12
filled	12
with	12
amazement.”	12
“I	12
will	12
answer	12
that	12
briefly,”	12
replied	12
the	12
curate;	12
“you	12
must	12
know	12
then,	12
Señor	12
Don	12
Quixote,	12
that	12
Master	12
Nicholas,	12
our	12
friend	12
and	12
barber,	12
and	12
I	12
were	12
going	12
to	12
Seville	12
to	12
receive	12
some	12
money	12
that	12
a	12
relative	12
of	12
mine	12
who	12
went	12
to	12
the	12
Indies	12
many	12
years	12
ago	12
had	12
sent	12
me,	12
and	12
not	12
such	12
a	12
small	12
sum	12
but	12
that	12
it	12
was	12
over	12
sixty	12
thousand	12
pieces	12
of	12
eight,	12
full	12
weight,	12
which	12
is	12
something;	12
and	12
passing	12
by	12
this	12
place	12
yesterday	12
we	12
were	12
attacked	12
by	12
four	12
footpads,	12
who	12
stripped	12
us	12
even	12
to	12
our	12
beards,	12
and	12
them	12
they	12
stripped	12
off	12
so	12
that	12
the	12
barber	12
found	12
it	12
necessary	12
to	12
put	12
on	12
a	12
false	12
one,	12
and	12
even	12
this	12
young	12
man	12
here”—pointing	12
to	12
Cardenio—“they	12
completely	12
transformed.	12
But	12
the	12
best	12
of	12
it	12
is,	12
the	12
story	12
goes	12
in	12
the	12
neighbourhood	12
that	12
those	12
who	12
attacked	12
us	12
belong	12
to	12
a	12
number	12
of	12
galley	12
slaves	12
who,	12
they	12
say,	12
were	12
set	12
free	12
almost	12
on	12
the	12
very	12
same	12
spot	12
by	12
a	12
man	12
of	12
such	12
valour	12
that,	12
in	12
spite	12
of	12
the	12
commissary	12
and	12
of	12
the	12
guards,	12
he	12
released	12
the	12
whole	12
of	12
them;	12
and	12
beyond	12
all	12
doubt	12
he	12
must	12
have	12
been	12
out	12
of	12
his	12
senses,	12
or	12
he	12
must	12
be	12
as	12
great	12
a	12
scoundrel	12
as	12
they,	12
or	12
some	12
man	12
without	12
heart	12
or	12
conscience	12
to	12
let	12
the	12
wolf	12
loose	12
among	12
the	12
sheep,	12
the	12
fox	12
among	12
the	12
hens,	12
the	12
fly	12
among	12
the	12
honey.	12
He	12
has	12
defrauded	12
justice,	12
and	12
opposed	12
his	12
king	12
and	12
lawful	12
master,	12
for	12
he	12
opposed	12
his	12
just	12
commands;	12
he	12
has,	12
I	12
say,	12
robbed	12
the	12
galleys	12
of	12
their	12
feet,	12
stirred	12
up	12
the	12
Holy	12
Brotherhood	12
which	12
for	12
many	12
years	12
past	12
has	12
been	12
quiet,	12
and,	12
lastly,	12
has	12
done	12
a	12
deed	12
by	12
which	12
his	12
soul	12
may	12
be	12
lost	12
without	12
any	12
gain	12
to	12
his	12
body.”	12
Sancho	12
had	12
told	12
the	12
curate	12
and	12
the	12
barber	12
of	12
the	12
adventure	12
of	12
the	12
galley	12
slaves,	12
which,	12
so	12
much	12
to	12
his	12
glory,	12
his	12
master	12
had	12
achieved,	12
and	12
hence	12
the	12
curate	12
in	12
alluding	12
to	12
it	12
made	12
the	12
most	12
of	12
it	12
to	12
see	12
what	12
would	12
be	12
said	12
or	12
done	12
by	12
Don	12
Quixote;	12
who	12
changed	12
colour	12
at	12
every	12
word,	12
not	12
daring	12
to	12
say	12
that	12
it	12
was	12
he	12
who	12
had	12
been	12
the	12
liberator	12
of	12
those	12
worthy	12
people.	12
“These,	12
then,”	12
said	12
the	12
curate,	12
“were	12
they	12
who	12
robbed	12
us;	12
and	12
God	12
in	12
his	12
mercy	12
pardon	12
him	12
who	12
would	12
not	12
let	12
them	12
go	12
to	12
the	12
punishment	12
they	12
deserved.”	12

The	12
curate	12
had	12
hardly	12
ceased	12
speaking,	12
when	12
Sancho	12
said,	12
“In	12
faith,	12
then,	12
señor	12
licentiate,	12
he	12
who	12
did	12
that	12
deed	12
was	12
my	12
master;	12
and	12
it	12
was	12
not	12
for	12
want	12
of	12
my	12
telling	12
him	12
beforehand	12
and	12
warning	12
him	12
to	12
mind	12
what	12
he	12
was	12
about,	12
and	12
that	12
it	12
was	12
a	12
sin	12
to	12
set	12
them	12
at	12
liberty,	12
as	12
they	12
were	12
all	12
on	12
the	12
march	12
there	12
because	12
they	12
were	12
special	12
scoundrels.”	12
“Blockhead!”	12
said	12
Don	12
Quixote	12
at	12
this,	12
“it	12
is	12
no	12
business	12
or	12
concern	12
of	12
knights-errant	12
to	12
inquire	12
whether	12
any	12
persons	12
in	12
affliction,	12
in	12
chains,	12
or	12
oppressed	12
that	12
they	12
may	12
meet	12
on	12
the	12
high	12
roads	12
go	12
that	12
way	12
and	12
suffer	12
as	12
they	12
do	12
because	12
of	12
their	12
faults	12
or	12
because	12
of	12
their	12
misfortunes.	12
It	12
only	12
concerns	12
them	12
to	12
aid	12
them	12
as	12
persons	12
in	12
need	12
of	12
help,	12
having	12
regard	12
to	12
their	12
sufferings	12
and	12
not	12
to	12
their	12
rascalities.	12
I	12
encountered	12
a	12
chaplet	12
or	12
string	12
of	12
miserable	12
and	12
unfortunate	12
people,	12
and	12
did	12
for	12
them	12
what	12
my	12
sense	12
of	12
duty	12
demands	12
of	12
me,	12
and	12
as	12
for	12
the	12
rest	12
be	12
that	12
as	12
it	12
may;	12
and	12
whoever	12
takes	12
objection	12
to	12
it,	12
saving	12
the	12
sacred	12
dignity	12
of	12
the	12
señor	12
licentiate	12
and	12
his	12
honoured	12
person,	12
I	12
say	12
he	12
knows	12
little	12
about	12
chivalry	12
and	12
lies	12
like	12
a	12
whoreson	12
villain,	12
and	12
this	12
I	12
will	12
give	12
him	12
to	12
know	12
to	12
the	12
fullest	12
extent	12
with	12
my	12
sword;”	12
and	12
so	12
saying	12
he	12
settled	12
himself	12
in	12
his	12
stirrups	12
and	12
pressed	12
down	12
his	12
morion;	12
for	12
the	12
barber’s	12
basin,	12
which	12
according	12
to	12
him	12
was	12
Mambrino’s	12
helmet,	12
he	12
carried	12
hanging	12
at	12
the	12
saddle-bow	12
until	12
he	12
could	12
repair	12
the	12
damage	12
done	12
to	12
it	12
by	12
the	12
galley	12
slaves.	12
Dorothea,	12
who	12
was	12
shrewd	12
and	12
sprightly,	12
and	12
by	12
this	12
time	12
thoroughly	12
understood	12
Don	12
Quixote’s	12
crazy	12
turn,	12
and	12
that	12
all	12
except	12
Sancho	12
Panza	12
were	12
making	12
game	12
of	12
him,	12
not	12
to	12
be	12
behind	12
the	12
rest	12
said	12
to	12
him,	12
on	12
observing	12
his	12
irritation,	12
“Sir	12
Knight,	12
remember	12
the	12
boon	12
you	12
have	12
promised	12
me,	12
and	12
that	12
in	12
accordance	12
with	12
it	12
you	12
must	12
not	12
engage	12
in	12
any	12
other	12
adventure,	12
be	12
it	12
ever	12
so	12
pressing;	12
calm	12
yourself,	12
for	12
if	12
the	12
licentiate	12
had	12
known	12
that	12
the	12
galley	12
slaves	12
had	12
been	12
set	12
free	12
by	12
that	12
unconquered	12
arm	12
he	12
would	12
have	12
stopped	12
his	12
mouth	12
thrice	12
over,	12
or	12
even	12
bitten	12
his	12
tongue	12
three	12
times	12
before	12
he	12
would	12
have	12
said	12
a	12
word	12
that	12
tended	12
towards	12
disrespect	12
of	12
your	12
worship.”	12
“That	12
I	12
swear	12
heartily,”	12
said	12
the	12
curate,	12
“and	12
I	12
would	12
have	12
even	12
plucked	12
off	12
a	12
moustache.”	12
“I	12
will	12
hold	12
my	12
peace,	12
señora,”	12
said	12
Don	12
Quixote,	12
“and	12
I	12
will	12
curb	12
the	12
natural	12
anger	12
that	12
had	12
arisen	12
in	12
my	12
breast,	12
and	12
will	12
proceed	12
in	12
peace	12
and	12
quietness	12
until	12
I	12
have	12
fulfilled	12
my	12
promise;	12
but	12
in	12
return	12
for	12
this	12
consideration	12
I	12
entreat	12
you	12
to	12
tell	12
me,	12
if	12
you	12
have	12
no	12
objection	12
to	12
do	12
so,	12
what	12
is	12
the	12
nature	12
of	12
your	12
trouble,	12
and	12
how	12
many,	12
who,	12
and	12
what	12
are	12
the	12
persons	12
of	12
whom	12
I	12
am	12
to	12
require	12
due	12
satisfaction,	12
and	12
on	12
whom	12
I	12
am	12
to	12
take	12
vengeance	12
on	12
your	12
behalf?”	12
“That	12
I	12
will	12
do	12
with	12
all	12
my	12
heart,”	12
replied	12
Dorothea,	12
“if	12
it	12
will	12
not	12
be	12
wearisome	12
to	12
you	12
to	12
hear	12
of	12
miseries	12
and	12
misfortunes.”	12
“It	12
will	12
not	12
be	12
wearisome,	12
señora,”	12
said	12
Don	12
Quixote;	12
to	12
which	12
Dorothea	12
replied,	12
“Well,	12
if	12
that	12
be	12
so,	12
give	12
me	12
your	12
attention.”	12
As	12
soon	12
as	12
she	12
said	12
this,	12
Cardenio	12
and	12
the	12
barber	12
drew	12
close	12
to	12
her	12
side,	12
eager	12
to	12
hear	12
what	12
sort	12
of	12
story	12
the	12
quick-witted	12
Dorothea	12
would	12
invent	12
for	12
herself;	12
and	12
Sancho	12
did	12
the	12
same,	12
for	12
he	12
was	12
as	12
much	12
taken	12
in	12
by	12
her	12
as	12
his	12
master;	12
and	12
she	12
having	12
settled	12
herself	12
comfortably	12
in	12
the	12
saddle,	12
and	12
with	12
the	12
help	12
of	12
coughing	12
and	12
other	12
preliminaries	12
taken	12
time	12
to	12
think,	12
began	12
with	12
great	12
sprightliness	12
of	12
manner	12
in	12
this	12
fashion.	12
“First	12
of	12
all,	12
I	12
would	12
have	12
you	12
know,	12
sirs,	12
that	12
my	12
name	12
is—”	12
and	12
here	12
she	12
stopped	12
for	12
a	12
moment,	12
for	12
she	12
forgot	12
the	12
name	12
the	12
curate	12
had	12
given	12
her;	12
but	12
he	12
came	12
to	12
her	12
relief,	12
seeing	12
what	12
her	12
difficulty	12
was,	12
and	12
said,	12
“It	12
is	12
no	12
wonder,	12
señora,	12
that	12
your	12
highness	12
should	12
be	12
confused	12
and	12
embarrassed	12
in	12
telling	12
the	12
tale	12
of	12
your	12
misfortunes;	12
for	12
such	12
afflictions	12
often	12
have	12
the	12
effect	12
of	12
depriving	12
the	12
sufferers	12
of	12
memory,	12
so	12
that	12
they	12
do	12
not	12
even	12
remember	12
their	12
own	12
names,	12
as	12
is	12
the	12
case	12
now	12
with	12
your	12
ladyship,	12
who	12
has	12
forgotten	12
that	12
she	12
is	12
called	12
the	12
Princess	12
Micomicona,	12
lawful	12
heiress	12
of	12
the	12
great	12
kingdom	12
of	12
Micomicon;	12
and	12
with	12
this	12
cue	12
your	12
highness	12
may	12
now	12
recall	12
to	12
your	12
sorrowful	12
recollection	12
all	12
you	12
may	12
wish	12
to	12
tell	12
us.”	12
“That	12
is	12
the	12
truth,”	12
said	12
the	12
damsel;	12
“but	12
I	12
think	12
from	12
this	12
on	12
I	12
shall	12
have	12
no	12
need	12
of	12
any	12
prompting,	12
and	12
I	12
shall	12
bring	12
my	12
true	12
story	12
safe	12
into	12
port,	12
and	12
here	12
it	12
is.	12
The	12
king	12
my	12
father,	12
who	12
was	12
called	12
Tinacrio	12
the	12
Sapient,	12
was	12
very	12
learned	12
in	12
what	12
they	12
call	12
magic	12
arts,	12
and	12
became	12
aware	12
by	12
his	12
craft	12
that	12
my	12
mother,	12
who	12
was	12
called	12
Queen	12
Jaramilla,	12
was	12
to	12
die	12
before	12
he	12
did,	12
and	12
that	12
soon	12
after	12
he	12
too	12
was	12
to	12
depart	12
this	12
life,	12
and	12
I	12
was	12
to	12
be	12
left	12
an	12
orphan	12
without	12
father	12
or	12
mother.	12
But	12
all	12
this,	12
he	12
declared,	12
did	12
not	12
so	12
much	12
grieve	12
or	12
distress	12
him	12
as	12
his	12
certain	12
knowledge	12
that	12
a	12
prodigious	12
giant,	12
the	12
lord	12
of	12
a	12
great	12
island	12
close	12
to	12
our	12
kingdom,	12
Pandafilando	12
of	12
the	12
Scowl	12
by	12
name—for	12
it	12
is	12
averred	12
that,	12
though	12
his	12
eyes	12
are	12
properly	12
placed	12
and	12
straight,	12
he	12
always	12
looks	12
askew	12
as	12
if	12
he	12
squinted,	12
and	12
this	12
he	12
does	12
out	12
of	12
malignity,	12
to	12
strike	12
fear	12
and	12
terror	12
into	12
those	12
he	12
looks	12
at—that	12
he	12
knew,	12
I	12
say,	12
that	12
this	12
giant	12
on	12
becoming	12
aware	12
of	12
my	12
orphan	12
condition	12
would	12
overrun	12
my	12
kingdom	12
with	12
a	12
mighty	12
force	12
and	12
strip	12
me	12
of	12
all,	12
not	12
leaving	12
me	12
even	12
a	12
small	12
village	12
to	12
shelter	12
me;	12
but	12
that	12
I	12
could	12
avoid	12
all	12
this	12
ruin	12
and	12
misfortune	12
if	12
I	12
were	12
willing	12
to	12
marry	12
him;	12
however,	12
as	12
far	12
as	12
he	12
could	12
see,	12
he	12
never	12
expected	12
that	12
I	12
would	12
consent	12
to	12
a	12
marriage	12
so	12
unequal;	12
and	12
he	12
said	12
no	12
more	12
than	12
the	12
truth	12
in	12
this,	12
for	12
it	12
has	12
never	12
entered	12
my	12
mind	12
to	12
marry	12
that	12
giant,	12
or	12
any	12
other,	12
let	12
him	12
be	12
ever	12
so	12
great	12
or	12
enormous.	12
My	12
father	12
said,	12
too,	12
that	12
when	12
he	12
was	12
dead,	12
and	12
I	12
saw	12
Pandafilando	12
about	12
to	12
invade	12
my	12
kingdom,	12
I	12
was	12
not	12
to	12
wait	12
and	12
attempt	12
to	12
defend	12
myself,	12
for	12
that	12
would	12
be	12
destructive	12
to	12
me,	12
but	12
that	12
I	12
should	12
leave	12
the	12
kingdom	12
entirely	12
open	12
to	12
him	12
if	12
I	12
wished	12
to	12
avoid	12
the	12
death	12
and	12
total	12
destruction	12
of	12
my	12
good	12
and	12
loyal	12
vassals,	12
for	12
there	12
would	12
be	12
no	12
possibility	12
of	12
defending	12
myself	12
against	12
the	12
giant’s	12
devilish	12
power;	12
and	12
that	12
I	12
should	12
at	12
once	12
with	12
some	12
of	12
my	12
followers	12
set	12
out	12
for	12
Spain,	12
where	12
I	12
should	12
obtain	12
relief	12
in	12
my	12
distress	12
on	12
finding	12
a	12
certain	12
knight-errant	12
whose	12
fame	12
by	12
that	12
time	12
would	12
extend	12
over	12
the	12
whole	12
kingdom,	12
and	12
who	12
would	12
be	12
called,	12
if	12
I	12
remember	12
rightly,	12
Don	12
Azote	12
or	12
Don	12
Gigote.”	12
“‘Don	12
Quixote,’	12
he	12
must	12
have	12
said,	12
señora,”	12
observed	12
Sancho	12
at	12
this,	12
“otherwise	12
called	12
the	12
Knight	12
of	12
the	12
Rueful	12
Countenance.”	12
“That	12
is	12
it,”	12
said	12
Dorothea;	12
“he	12
said,	12
moreover,	12
that	12
he	12
would	12
be	12
tall	12
of	12
stature	12
and	12
lank	12
featured;	12
and	12
that	12
on	12
his	12
right	12
side	12
under	12
the	12
left	12
shoulder,	12
or	12
thereabouts,	12
he	12
would	12
have	12
a	12
grey	12
mole	12
with	12
hairs	12
like	12
bristles.”	12
On	12
hearing	12
this,	12
Don	12
Quixote	12
said	12
to	12
his	12
squire,	12
“Here,	12
Sancho	12
my	12
son,	12
bear	12
a	12
hand	12
and	12
help	12
me	12
to	12
strip,	12
for	12
I	12
want	12
to	12
see	12
if	12
I	12
am	12
the	12
knight	12
that	12
sage	12
king	12
foretold.”	12
“What	12
does	12
your	12
worship	12
want	12
to	12
strip	12
for?”	12
said	12
Dorothea.	12
“To	12
see	12
if	12
I	12
have	12
that	12
mole	12
your	12
father	12
spoke	12
of,”	12
answered	12
Don	12
Quixote.	12
“There	12
is	12
no	12
occasion	12
to	12
strip,”	12
said	12
Sancho;	12
“for	12
I	12
know	12
your	12
worship	12
has	12
just	12
such	12
a	12
mole	12
on	12
the	12
middle	12
of	12
your	12
backbone,	12
which	12
is	12
the	12
mark	12
of	12
a	12
strong	12
man.”	12
“That	12
is	12
enough,”	12
said	12
Dorothea,	12
“for	12
with	12
friends	12
we	12
must	12
not	12
look	12
too	12
closely	12
into	12
trifles;	12
and	12
whether	12
it	12
be	12
on	12
the	12
shoulder	12
or	12
on	12
the	12
backbone	12
matters	12
little;	12
it	12
is	12
enough	12
if	12
there	12
is	12
a	12
mole,	12
be	12
it	12
where	12
it	12
may,	12
for	12
it	12
is	12
all	12
the	12
same	12
flesh;	12
no	12
doubt	12
my	12
good	12
father	12
hit	12
the	12
truth	12
in	12
every	12
particular,	12
and	12
I	12
have	12
made	12
a	12
lucky	12
hit	12
in	12
commending	12
myself	12
to	12
Don	12
Quixote;	12
for	12
he	12
is	12
the	12
one	12
my	12
father	12
spoke	12
of,	12
as	12
the	12
features	12
of	12
his	12
countenance	12
correspond	12
with	12
those	12
assigned	12
to	12
this	12
knight	12
by	12
that	12
wide	12
fame	12
he	12
has	12
acquired	12
not	12
only	12
in	12
Spain	12
but	12
in	12
all	12
La	12
Mancha;	12
for	12
I	12
had	12
scarcely	12
landed	12
at	12
Osuna	12
when	12
I	12
heard	12
such	12
accounts	12
of	12
his	12
achievements,	12
that	12
at	12
once	12
my	12
heart	12
told	12
me	12
he	12
was	12
the	12
very	12
one	12
I	12
had	12
come	12
in	12
search	12
of.”	12
“But	12
how	12
did	12
you	12
land	12
at	12
Osuna,	12
señora,”	12
asked	12
Don	12
Quixote,	12
“when	12
it	12
is	12
not	12
a	12
seaport?”	12
But	12
before	12
Dorothea	12
could	12
reply	12
the	12
curate	12
anticipated	12
her,	12
saying,	12
“The	12
princess	12
meant	12
to	12
say	12
that	12
after	12
she	12
had	12
landed	12
at	12
Malaga	12
the	12
first	12
place	12
where	12
she	12
heard	12
of	12
your	12
worship	12
was	12
Osuna.”	12
“That	12
is	12
what	12
I	12
meant	12
to	12
say,”	12
said	12
Dorothea.	12
“And	12
that	12
would	12
be	12
only	12
natural,”	12
said	12
the	12
curate.	12
“Will	12
your	12
majesty	12
please	12
proceed?”	12
“There	12
is	12
no	12
more	12
to	12
add,”	12
said	12
Dorothea,	12
“save	12
that	12
in	12
finding	12
Don	12
Quixote	12
I	12
have	12
had	12
such	12
good	12
fortune,	12
that	12
I	12
already	12
reckon	12
and	12
regard	12
myself	12
queen	12
and	12
mistress	12
of	12
my	12
entire	12
dominions,	12
since	12
of	12
his	12
courtesy	12
and	12
magnanimity	12
he	12
has	12
granted	12
me	12
the	12
boon	12
of	12
accompanying	12
me	12
whithersoever	12
I	12
may	12
conduct	12
him,	12
which	12
will	12
be	12
only	12
to	12
bring	12
him	12
face	12
to	12
face	12
with	12
Pandafilando	12
of	12
the	12
Scowl,	12
that	12
he	12
may	12
slay	12
him	12
and	12
restore	12
to	12
me	12
what	12
has	12
been	12
unjustly	12
usurped	12
by	12
him:	12
for	12
all	12
this	12
must	12
come	12
to	12
pass	12
satisfactorily	12
since	12
my	12
good	12
father	12
Tinacrio	12
the	12
Sapient	12
foretold	12
it,	12
who	12
likewise	12
left	12
it	12
declared	12
in	12
writing	12
in	12
Chaldee	12
or	12
Greek	12
characters	12
(for	12
I	12
cannot	12
read	12
them),	12
that	12
if	12
this	12
predicted	12
knight,	12
after	12
having	12
cut	12
the	12
giant’s	12
throat,	12
should	12
be	12
disposed	12
to	12
marry	12
me	12
I	12
was	12
to	12
offer	12
myself	12
at	12
once	12
without	12
demur	12
as	12
his	12
lawful	12
wife,	12
and	12
yield	12
him	12
possession	12
of	12
my	12
kingdom	12
together	12
with	12
my	12
person.”	12
“What	12
thinkest	12
thou	12
now,	12
friend	12
Sancho?”	12
said	12
Don	12
Quixote	12
at	12
this.	12
“Hearest	12
thou	12
that?	12
Did	12
I	12
not	12
tell	12
thee	12
so?	12
See	12
how	12
we	12
have	12
already	12
got	12
a	12
kingdom	12
to	12
govern	12
and	12
a	12
queen	12
to	12
marry!”	12
“On	12
my	12
oath	12
it	12
is	12
so,”	12
said	12
Sancho;	12
“and	12
foul	12
fortune	12
to	12
him	12
who	12
won’t	12
marry	12
after	12
slitting	12
Señor	12
Pandahilado’s	12
windpipe!	12
And	12
then,	12
how	12
illfavoured	12
the	12
queen	12
is!	12
I	12
wish	12
the	12
fleas	12
in	12
my	12
bed	12
were	12
that	12
sort!”	12
And	12
so	12
saying	12
he	12
cut	12
a	12
couple	12
of	12
capers	12
in	12
the	12
air	12
with	12
every	12
sign	12
of	12
extreme	12
satisfaction,	12
and	12
then	12
ran	12
to	12
seize	12
the	12
bridle	12
of	12
Dorothea’s	12
mule,	12
and	12
checking	12
it	12
fell	12
on	12
his	12
knees	12
before	12
her,	12
begging	12
her	12
to	12
give	12
him	12
her	12
hand	12
to	12
kiss	12
in	12
token	12
of	12
his	12
acknowledgment	12
of	12
her	12
as	12
his	12
queen	12
and	12
mistress.	12
Which	12
of	12
the	12
bystanders	12
could	12
have	12
helped	12
laughing	12
to	12
see	12
the	12
madness	12
of	12
the	12
master	12
and	12
the	12
simplicity	12
of	12
the	12
servant?	12
Dorothea	12
therefore	12
gave	12
her	12
hand,	12
and	12
promised	12
to	12
make	12
him	12
a	12
great	12
lord	12
in	12
her	12
kingdom,	12
when	12
Heaven	12
should	12
be	12
so	12
good	12
as	12
to	12
permit	12
her	12
to	12
recover	12
and	12
enjoy	12
it,	12
for	12
which	12
Sancho	12
returned	12
thanks	12
in	12
words	12
that	12
set	12
them	12
all	12
laughing	12
again.	12
“This,	12
sirs,”	12
continued	12
Dorothea,	12
“is	12
my	12
story;	12
it	12
only	12
remains	12
to	12
tell	12
you	12
that	12
of	12
all	12
the	12
attendants	12
I	12
took	12
with	12
me	12
from	12
my	12
kingdom	12
I	12
have	12
none	12
left	12
except	12
this	12
well-bearded	12
squire,	12
for	12
all	12
were	12
drowned	12
in	12
a	12
great	12
tempest	12
we	12
encountered	12
when	12
in	12
sight	12
of	12
port;	12
and	12
he	12
and	12
I	12
came	12
to	12
land	12
on	12
a	12
couple	12
of	12
planks	12
as	12
if	12
by	12
a	12
miracle;	12
and	12
indeed	12
the	12
whole	12
course	12
of	12
my	12
life	12
is	12
a	12
miracle	12
and	12
a	12
mystery	12
as	12
you	12
may	12
have	12
observed;	12
and	12
if	12
I	12
have	12
been	12
over	12
minute	12
in	12
any	12
respect	12
or	12
not	12
as	12
precise	12
as	12
I	12
ought,	12
let	12
it	12
be	12
accounted	12
for	12
by	12
what	12
the	12
licentiate	12
said	12
at	12
the	12
beginning	12
of	12
my	12
tale,	12
that	12
constant	12
and	12
excessive	12
troubles	12
deprive	12
the	12
sufferers	12
of	12
their	12
memory.”	12
“They	12
shall	12
not	12
deprive	12
me	12
of	12
mine,	12
exalted	12
and	12
worthy	12
princess,”	12
said	12
Don	12
Quixote,	12
“however	12
great	12
and	12
unexampled	12
those	12
which	12
I	12
shall	12
endure	12
in	12
your	12
service	12
may	12
be;	12
and	12
here	12
I	12
confirm	12
anew	12
the	12
boon	12
I	12
have	12
promised	12
you,	12
and	12
I	12
swear	12
to	12
go	12
with	12
you	12
to	12
the	12
end	12
of	12
the	12
world	12
until	12
I	12
find	12
myself	12
in	12
the	12
presence	12
of	12
your	12
fierce	12
enemy,	12
whose	12
haughty	12
head	12
I	12
trust	12
by	12
the	12
aid	12
of	12
my	12
arm	12
to	12
cut	12
off	12
with	12
the	12
edge	12
of	12
this—I	12
will	12
not	12
say	12
good	12
sword,	12
thanks	12
to	12
Gines	12
de	12
Pasamonte	12
who	12
carried	12
away	12
mine”—(this	12
he	12
said	12
between	12
his	12
teeth,	12
and	12
then	12
continued),	12
“and	12
when	12
it	12
has	12
been	12
cut	12
off	12
and	12
you	12
have	12
been	12
put	12
in	12
peaceful	12
possession	12
of	12
your	12
realm	12
it	12
shall	12
be	12
left	12
to	12
your	12
own	12
decision	12
to	12
dispose	12
of	12
your	12
person	12
as	12
may	12
be	12
most	12
pleasing	12
to	12
you;	12
for	12
so	12
long	12
as	12
my	12
memory	12
is	12
occupied,	12
my	12
will	12
enslaved,	12
and	12
my	12
understanding	12
enthralled	12
by	12
her—I	12
say	12
no	12
more—it	12
is	12
impossible	12
for	12
me	12
for	12
a	12
moment	12
to	12
contemplate	12
marriage,	12
even	12
with	12
a	12
Phœnix.”	12
The	12
last	12
words	12
of	12
his	12
master	12
about	12
not	12
wanting	12
to	12
marry	12
were	12
so	12
disagreeable	12
to	12
Sancho	12
that	12
raising	12
his	12
voice	12
he	12
exclaimed	12
with	12
great	12
irritation:	12
“By	12
my	12
oath,	12
Señor	12
Don	12
Quixote,	12
you	12
are	12
not	12
in	12
your	12
right	12
senses;	12
for	12
how	12
can	12
your	12
worship	12
possibly	12
object	12
to	12
marrying	12
such	12
an	12
exalted	12
princess	12
as	12
this?	12
Do	12
you	12
think	12
Fortune	12
will	12
offer	12
you	12
behind	12
every	12
stone	12
such	12
a	12
piece	12
of	12
luck	12
as	12
is	12
offered	12
you	12
now?	12
Is	12
my	12
lady	12
Dulcinea	12
fairer,	12
perchance?	12
Not	12
she;	12
nor	12
half	12
as	12
fair;	12
and	12
I	12
will	12
even	12
go	12
so	12
far	12
as	12
to	12
say	12
she	12
does	12
not	12
come	12
up	12
to	12
the	12
shoe	12
of	12
this	12
one	12
here.	12
A	12
poor	12
chance	12
I	12
have	12
of	12
getting	12
that	12
county	12
I	12
am	12
waiting	12
for	12
if	12
your	12
worship	12
goes	12
looking	12
for	12
dainties	12
in	12
the	12
bottom	12
of	12
the	12
sea.	12
In	12
the	12
devil’s	12
name,	12
marry,	13
and	13
take	13
this	13
kingdom	13
that	13
comes	13
to	13
hand	13
without	13
any	13
trouble,	13
and	13
when	13
you	13
are	13
king	13
make	13
me	13
a	13
marquis	13
or	13
governor	13
of	13
a	13
province,	13
and	13
for	13
the	13
rest	13
let	13
the	13
devil	13
take	13
it	13
all.”	13
Don	13
Quixote,	13
when	13
he	13
heard	13
such	13
blasphemies	13
uttered	13
against	13
his	13
lady	13
Dulcinea,	13
could	13
not	13
endure	13
it,	13
and	13
lifting	13
his	13
pike,	13
without	13
saying	13
anything	13
to	13
Sancho	13
or	13
uttering	13
a	13
word,	13
he	13
gave	13
him	13
two	13
such	13
thwacks	13
that	13
he	13
brought	13
him	13
to	13
the	13
ground;	13
and	13
had	13
it	13
not	13
been	13
that	13
Dorothea	13
cried	13
out	13
to	13
him	13
to	13
spare	13
him	13
he	13
would	13
have	13
no	13
doubt	13
taken	13
his	13
life	13
on	13
the	13
spot.	13
“Do	13
you	13
think,”	13
he	13
said	13
to	13
him	13
after	13
a	13
pause,	13
“you	13
scurvy	13
clown,	13
that	13
you	13
are	13
to	13
be	13
always	13
interfering	13
with	13
me,	13
and	13
that	13
you	13
are	13
to	13
be	13
always	13
offending	13
and	13
I	13
always	13
pardoning?	13
Don’t	13
fancy	13
it,	13
impious	13
scoundrel,	13
for	13
that	13
beyond	13
a	13
doubt	13
thou	13
art,	13
since	13
thou	13
hast	13
set	13
thy	13
tongue	13
going	13
against	13
the	13
peerless	13
Dulcinea.	13
Know	13
you	13
not,	13
lout,	13
vagabond,	13
beggar,	13
that	13
were	13
it	13
not	13
for	13
the	13
might	13
that	13
she	13
infuses	13
into	13
my	13
arm	13
I	13
should	13
not	13
have	13
strength	13
enough	13
to	13
kill	13
a	13
flea?	13
Say,	13
scoffer	13
with	13
a	13
viper’s	13
tongue,	13
what	13
think	13
you	13
has	13
won	13
this	13
kingdom	13
and	13
cut	13
off	13
this	13
giant’s	13
head	13
and	13
made	13
you	13
a	13
marquis	13
(for	13
all	13
this	13
I	13
count	13
as	13
already	13
accomplished	13
and	13
decided),	13
but	13
the	13
might	13
of	13
Dulcinea,	13
employing	13
my	13
arm	13
as	13
the	13
instrument	13
of	13
her	13
achievements?	13
She	13
fights	13
in	13
me	13
and	13
conquers	13
in	13
me,	13
and	13
I	13
live	13
and	13
breathe	13
in	13
her,	13
and	13
owe	13
my	13
life	13
and	13
being	13
to	13
her.	13
O	13
whoreson	13
scoundrel,	13
how	13
ungrateful	13
you	13
are,	13
you	13
see	13
yourself	13
raised	13
from	13
the	13
dust	13
of	13
the	13
earth	13
to	13
be	13
a	13
titled	13
lord,	13
and	13
the	13
return	13
you	13
make	13
for	13
so	13
great	13
a	13
benefit	13
is	13
to	13
speak	13
evil	13
of	13
her	13
who	13
has	13
conferred	13
it	13
upon	13
you!”	13
Sancho	13
was	13
not	13
so	13
stunned	13
but	13
that	13
he	13
heard	13
all	13
his	13
master	13
said,	13
and	13
rising	13
with	13
some	13
degree	13
of	13
nimbleness	13
he	13
ran	13
to	13
place	13
himself	13
behind	13
Dorothea’s	13
palfrey,	13
and	13
from	13
that	13
position	13
he	13
said	13
to	13
his	13
master:	13
“Tell	13
me,	13
señor;	13
if	13
your	13
worship	13
is	13
resolved	13
not	13
to	13
marry	13
this	13
great	13
princess,	13
it	13
is	13
plain	13
the	13
kingdom	13
will	13
not	13
be	13
yours;	13
and	13
not	13
being	13
so,	13
how	13
can	13
you	13
bestow	13
favours	13
upon	13
me?	13
That	13
is	13
what	13
I	13
complain	13
of.	13
Let	13
your	13
worship	13
at	13
any	13
rate	13
marry	13
this	13
queen,	13
now	13
that	13
we	13
have	13
got	13
her	13
here	13
as	13
if	13
showered	13
down	13
from	13
heaven,	13
and	13
afterwards	13
you	13
may	13
go	13
back	13
to	13
my	13
lady	13
Dulcinea;	13
for	13
there	13
must	13
have	13
been	13
kings	13
in	13
the	13
world	13
who	13
kept	13
mistresses.	13
As	13
to	13
beauty,	13
I	13
have	13
nothing	13
to	13
do	13
with	13
it;	13
and	13
if	13
the	13
truth	13
is	13
to	13
be	13
told,	13
I	13
like	13
them	13
both;	13
though	13
I	13
have	13
never	13
seen	13
the	13
lady	13
Dulcinea.”	13
“How!	13
never	13
seen	13
her,	13
blasphemous	13
traitor!”	13
exclaimed	13
Don	13
Quixote;	13
“hast	13
thou	13
not	13
just	13
now	13
brought	13
me	13
a	13
message	13
from	13
her?”	13
“I	13
mean,”	13
said	13
Sancho,	13
“that	13
I	13
did	13
not	13
see	13
her	13
so	13
much	13
at	13
my	13
leisure	13
that	13
I	13
could	13
take	13
particular	13
notice	13
of	13
her	13
beauty,	13
or	13
of	13
her	13
charms	13
piecemeal;	13
but	13
taken	13
in	13
the	13
lump	13
I	13
like	13
her.”	13
“Now	13
I	13
forgive	13
thee,”	13
said	13
Don	13
Quixote;	13
“and	13
do	13
thou	13
forgive	13
me	13
the	13
injury	13
I	13
have	13
done	13
thee;	13
for	13
our	13
first	13
impulses	13
are	13
not	13
in	13
our	13
control.”	13
“That	13
I	13
see,”	13
replied	13
Sancho,	13
“and	13
with	13
me	13
the	13
wish	13
to	13
speak	13
is	13
always	13
the	13
first	13
impulse,	13
and	13
I	13
cannot	13
help	13
saying,	13
once	13
at	13
any	13
rate,	13
what	13
I	13
have	13
on	13
the	13
tip	13
of	13
my	13
tongue.”	13
“For	13
all	13
that,	13
Sancho,”	13
said	13
Don	13
Quixote,	13
“take	13
heed	13
of	13
what	13
thou	13
sayest,	13
for	13
the	13
pitcher	13
goes	13
so	13
often	13
to	13
the	13
well—I	13
need	13
say	13
no	13
more	13
to	13
thee.”	13
“Well,	13
well,”	13
said	13
Sancho,	13
“God	13
is	13
in	13
heaven,	13
and	13
sees	13
all	13
tricks,	13
and	13
will	13
judge	13
who	13
does	13
most	13
harm,	13
I	13
in	13
not	13
speaking	13
right,	13
or	13
your	13
worship	13
in	13
not	13
doing	13
it.”	13
“That	13
is	13
enough,”	13
said	13
Dorothea;	13
“run,	13
Sancho,	13
and	13
kiss	13
your	13
lord’s	13
hand	13
and	13
beg	13
his	13
pardon,	13
and	13
henceforward	13
be	13
more	13
circumspect	13
with	13
your	13
praise	13
and	13
abuse;	13
and	13
say	13
nothing	13
in	13
disparagement	13
of	13
that	13
lady	13
Toboso,	13
of	13
whom	13
I	13
know	13
nothing	13
save	13
that	13
I	13
am	13
her	13
servant;	13
and	13
put	13
your	13
trust	13
in	13
God,	13
for	13
you	13
will	13
not	13
fail	13
to	13
obtain	13
some	13
dignity	13
so	13
as	13
to	13
live	13
like	13
a	13
prince.”	13
Sancho	13
advanced	13
hanging	13
his	13
head	13
and	13
begged	13
his	13
master’s	13
hand,	13
which	13
Don	13
Quixote	13
with	13
dignity	13
presented	13
to	13
him,	13
giving	13
him	13
his	13
blessing	13
as	13
soon	13
as	13
he	13
had	13
kissed	13
it;	13
he	13
then	13
bade	13
him	13
go	13
on	13
ahead	13
a	13
little,	13
as	13
he	13
had	13
questions	13
to	13
ask	13
him	13
and	13
matters	13
of	13
great	13
importance	13
to	13
discuss	13
with	13
him.	13
Sancho	13
obeyed,	13
and	13
when	13
the	13
two	13
had	13
gone	13
some	13
distance	13
in	13
advance	13
Don	13
Quixote	13
said	13
to	13
him,	13
“Since	13
thy	13
return	13
I	13
have	13
had	13
no	13
opportunity	13
or	13
time	13
to	13
ask	13
thee	13
many	13
particulars	13
touching	13
thy	13
mission	13
and	13
the	13
answer	13
thou	13
hast	13
brought	13
back,	13
and	13
now	13
that	13
chance	13
has	13
granted	13
us	13
the	13
time	13
and	13
opportunity,	13
deny	13
me	13
not	13
the	13
happiness	13
thou	13
canst	13
give	13
me	13
by	13
such	13
good	13
news.”	13
“Let	13
your	13
worship	13
ask	13
what	13
you	13
will,”	13
answered	13
Sancho,	13
“for	13
I	13
shall	13
find	13
a	13
way	13
out	13
of	13
all	13
as	13
I	13
found	13
a	13
way	13
in;	13
but	13
I	13
implore	13
you,	13
señor,	13
not	13
to	13
be	13
so	13
revengeful	13
in	13
future.”	13
“Why	13
dost	13
thou	13
say	13
that,	13
Sancho?”	13
said	13
Don	13
Quixote.	13
“I	13
say	13
it,”	13
he	13
returned,	13
“because	13
those	13
blows	13
just	13
now	13
were	13
more	13
because	13
of	13
the	13
quarrel	13
the	13
devil	13
stirred	13
up	13
between	13
us	13
both	13
the	13
other	13
night,	13
than	13
for	13
what	13
I	13
said	13
against	13
my	13
lady	13
Dulcinea,	13
whom	13
I	13
love	13
and	13
reverence	13
as	13
I	13
would	13
a	13
relic—though	13
there	13
is	13
nothing	13
of	13
that	13
about	13
her—merely	13
as	13
something	13
belonging	13
to	13
your	13
worship.”	13
“Say	13
no	13
more	13
on	13
that	13
subject	13
for	13
thy	13
life,	13
Sancho,”	13
said	13
Don	13
Quixote,	13
“for	13
it	13
is	13
displeasing	13
to	13
me;	13
I	13
have	13
already	13
pardoned	13
thee	13
for	13
that,	13
and	13
thou	13
knowest	13
the	13
common	13
saying,	13
‘for	13
a	13
fresh	13
sin	13
a	13
fresh	13
penance.’”	13
While	13
this	13
was	13
going	13
on	13
they	13
saw	13
coming	13
along	13
the	13
road	13
they	13
were	13
following	13
a	13
man	13
mounted	13
on	13
an	13
ass,	13
who	13
when	13
he	13
came	13
close	13
seemed	13
to	13
be	13
a	13
gipsy;	13
but	13
Sancho	13
Panza,	13
whose	13
eyes	13
and	13
heart	13
were	13
there	13
wherever	13
he	13
saw	13
asses,	13
no	13
sooner	13
beheld	13
the	13
man	13
than	13
he	13
knew	13
him	13
to	13
be	13
Gines	13
de	13
Pasamonte;	13
and	13
by	13
the	13
thread	13
of	13
the	13
gipsy	13
he	13
got	13
at	13
the	13
ball,	13
his	13
ass,	13
for	13
it	13
was,	13
in	13
fact,	13
Dapple	13
that	13
carried	13
Pasamonte,	13
who	13
to	13
escape	13
recognition	13
and	13
to	13
sell	13
the	13
ass	13
had	13
disguised	13
himself	13
as	13
a	13
gipsy,	13
being	13
able	13
to	13
speak	13
the	13
gipsy	13
language,	13
and	13
many	13
more,	13
as	13
well	13
as	13
if	13
they	13
were	13
his	13
own.	13
Sancho	13
saw	13
him	13
and	13
recognised	13
him,	13
and	13
the	13
instant	13
he	13
did	13
so	13
he	13
shouted	13
to	13
him,	13
“Ginesillo,	13
you	13
thief,	13
give	13
up	13
my	13
treasure,	13
release	13
my	13
life,	13
embarrass	13
thyself	13
not	13
with	13
my	13
repose,	13
quit	13
my	13
ass,	13
leave	13
my	13
delight,	13
be	13
off,	13
rip,	13
get	13
thee	13
gone,	13
thief,	13
and	13
give	13
up	13
what	13
is	13
not	13
thine.”	13
There	13
was	13
no	13
necessity	13
for	13
so	13
many	13
words	13
or	13
objurgations,	13
for	13
at	13
the	13
first	13
one	13
Gines	13
jumped	13
down,	13
and	13
at	13
a	13
like	13
racing	13
speed	13
made	13
off	13
and	13
got	13
clear	13
of	13
them	13
all.	13
Sancho	13
hastened	13
to	13
his	13
Dapple,	13
and	13
embracing	13
him	13
he	13
said,	13
“How	13
hast	13
thou	13
fared,	13
my	13
blessing,	13
Dapple	13
of	13
my	13
eyes,	13
my	13
comrade?”	13
all	13
the	13
while	13
kissing	13
him	13
and	13
caressing	13
him	13
as	13
if	13
he	13
were	13
a	13
human	13
being.	13
The	13
ass	13
held	13
his	13
peace,	13
and	13
let	13
himself	13
be	13
kissed	13
and	13
caressed	13
by	13
Sancho	13
without	13
answering	13
a	13
single	13
word.	13
They	13
all	13
came	13
up	13
and	13
congratulated	13
him	13
on	13
having	13
found	13
Dapple,	13
Don	13
Quixote	13
especially,	13
who	13
told	13
him	13
that	13
notwithstanding	13
this	13
he	13
would	13
not	13
cancel	13
the	13
order	13
for	13
the	13
three	13
ass-colts,	13
for	13
which	13
Sancho	13
thanked	13
him.	13
While	13
the	13
two	13
had	13
been	13
going	13
along	13
conversing	13
in	13
this	13
fashion,	13
the	13
curate	13
observed	13
to	13
Dorothea	13
that	13
she	13
had	13
shown	13
great	13
cleverness,	13
as	13
well	13
in	13
the	13
story	13
itself	13
as	13
in	13
its	13
conciseness,	13
and	13
the	13
resemblance	13
it	13
bore	13
to	13
those	13
of	13
the	13
books	13
of	13
chivalry.	13
She	13
said	13
that	13
she	13
had	13
many	13
times	13
amused	13
herself	13
reading	13
them;	13
but	13
that	13
she	13
did	13
not	13
know	13
the	13
situation	13
of	13
the	13
provinces	13
or	13
seaports,	13
and	13
so	13
she	13
had	13
said	13
at	13
haphazard	13
that	13
she	13
had	13
landed	13
at	13
Osuna.	13
“So	13
I	13
saw,”	13
said	13
the	13
curate,	13
“and	13
for	13
that	13
reason	13
I	13
made	13
haste	13
to	13
say	13
what	13
I	13
did,	13
by	13
which	13
it	13
was	13
all	13
set	13
right.	13
But	13
is	13
it	13
not	13
a	13
strange	13
thing	13
to	13
see	13
how	13
readily	13
this	13
unhappy	13
gentleman	13
believes	13
all	13
these	13
figments	13
and	13
lies,	13
simply	13
because	13
they	13
are	13
in	13
the	13
style	13
and	13
manner	13
of	13
the	13
absurdities	13
of	13
his	13
books?”	13
“So	13
it	13
is,”	13
said	13
Cardenio;	13
“and	13
so	13
uncommon	13
and	13
unexampled,	13
that	13
were	13
one	13
to	13
attempt	13
to	13
invent	13
and	13
concoct	13
it	13
in	13
fiction,	13
I	13
doubt	13
if	13
there	13
be	13
any	13
wit	13
keen	13
enough	13
to	13
imagine	13
it.”	13
“But	13
another	13
strange	13
thing	13
about	13
it,”	13
said	13
the	13
curate,	13
“is	13
that,	13
apart	13
from	13
the	13
silly	13
things	13
which	13
this	13
worthy	13
gentleman	13
says	13
in	13
connection	13
with	13
his	13
craze,	13
when	13
other	13
subjects	13
are	13
dealt	13
with,	13
he	13
can	13
discuss	13
them	13
in	13
a	13
perfectly	13
rational	13
manner,	13
showing	13
that	13
his	13
mind	13
is	13
quite	13
clear	13
and	13
composed;	13
so	13
that,	13
provided	13
his	13
chivalry	13
is	13
not	13
touched	13
upon,	13
no	13
one	13
would	13
take	13
him	13
to	13
be	13
anything	13
but	13
a	13
man	13
of	13
thoroughly	13
sound	13
understanding.”	13
While	13
they	13
were	13
holding	13
this	13
conversation	13
Don	13
Quixote	13
continued	13
his	13
with	13
Sancho,	13
saying:	13
“Friend	13
Panza,	13
let	13
us	13
forgive	13
and	13
forget	13
as	13
to	13
our	13
quarrels,	13
and	13
tell	13
me	13
now,	13
dismissing	13
anger	13
and	13
irritation,	13
where,	13
how,	13
and	13
when	13
didst	13
thou	13
find	13
Dulcinea?	13
What	13
was	13
she	13
doing?	13
What	13
didst	13
thou	13
say	13
to	13
her?	13
What	13
did	13
she	13
answer?	13
How	13
did	13
she	13
look	13
when	13
she	13
was	13
reading	13
my	13
letter?	13
Who	13
copied	13
it	13
out	13
for	13
thee?	13
and	13
everything	13
in	13
the	13
matter	13
that	13
seems	13
to	13
thee	13
worth	13
knowing,	13
asking,	13
and	13
learning;	13
neither	13
adding	13
nor	13
falsifying	13
to	13
give	13
me	13
pleasure,	13
nor	13
yet	13
curtailing	13
lest	13
you	13
should	13
deprive	13
me	13
of	13
it.”	13
“Señor,”	13
replied	13
Sancho,	13
“if	13
the	13
truth	13
is	13
to	13
be	13
told,	13
nobody	13
copied	13
out	13
the	13
letter	13
for	13
me,	13
for	13
I	13
carried	13
no	13
letter	13
at	13
all.”	13
“It	13
is	13
as	13
thou	13
sayest,”	13
said	13
Don	13
Quixote,	13
“for	13
the	13
notebook	13
in	13
which	13
I	13
wrote	13
it	13
I	13
found	13
in	13
my	13
own	13
possession	13
two	13
days	13
after	13
thy	13
departure,	13
which	13
gave	13
me	13
very	13
great	13
vexation,	13
as	13
I	13
knew	13
not	13
what	13
thou	13
wouldst	13
do	13
on	13
finding	13
thyself	13
without	13
any	13
letter;	13
and	13
I	13
made	13
sure	13
thou	13
wouldst	13
return	13
from	13
the	13
place	13
where	13
thou	13
didst	13
first	13
miss	13
it.”	13
“So	13
I	13
should	13
have	13
done,”	13
said	13
Sancho,	13
“if	13
I	13
had	13
not	13
got	13
it	13
by	13
heart	13
when	13
your	13
worship	13
read	13
it	13
to	13
me,	13
so	13
that	13
I	13
repeated	13
it	13
to	13
a	13
sacristan,	13
who	13
copied	13
it	13
out	13
for	13
me	13
from	13
hearing	13
it,	13
so	13
exactly	13
that	13
he	13
said	13
in	13
all	13
the	13
days	13
of	13
his	13
life,	13
though	13
he	13
had	13
read	13
many	13
a	13
letter	13
of	13
excommunication,	13
he	13
had	13
never	13
seen	13
or	13
read	13
so	13
pretty	13
a	13
letter	13
as	13
that.”	13
“And	13
hast	13
thou	13
got	13
it	13
still	13
in	13
thy	13
memory,	13
Sancho?”	13
said	13
Don	13
Quixote.	13
“No,	13
señor,”	13
replied	13
Sancho,	13
“for	13
as	13
soon	13
as	13
I	13
had	13
repeated	13
it,	13
seeing	13
there	13
was	13
no	13
further	13
use	13
for	13
it,	13
I	13
set	13
about	13
forgetting	13
it;	13
and	13
if	13
I	13
recollect	13
any	13
of	13
it,	13
it	13
is	13
that	13
about	13
‘Scrubbing,’	13
I	13
mean	13
to	13
say	13
‘Sovereign	13
Lady,’	13
and	13
the	13
end	13
‘Yours	13
till	13
death,	13
the	13
Knight	13
of	13
the	13
Rueful	13
Countenance;’	13
and	13
between	13
these	13
two	13
I	13
put	13
into	13
it	13
more	13
than	13
three	13
hundred	13
‘my	13
souls’	13
and	13
‘my	13
life’s’	13
and	13
‘my	13
eyes.”	13

“All	13
that	13
is	13
not	13
unsatisfactory	13
to	13
me,”	13
said	13
Don	13
Quixote.	13
“Go	13
on;	13
thou	13
didst	13
reach	13
her;	13
and	13
what	13
was	13
that	13
queen	13
of	13
beauty	13
doing?	13
Surely	13
thou	13
didst	13
find	13
her	13
stringing	13
pearls,	13
or	13
embroidering	13
some	13
device	13
in	13
gold	13
thread	13
for	13
this	13
her	13
enslaved	13
knight.”	13
“I	13
did	13
not,”	13
said	13
Sancho,	13
“but	13
I	13
found	13
her	13
winnowing	13
two	13
bushels	13
of	13
wheat	13
in	13
the	13
yard	13
of	13
her	13
house.”	13
“Then	13
depend	13
upon	13
it,”	13
said	13
Don	13
Quixote,	13
“the	13
grains	13
of	13
that	13
wheat	13
were	13
pearls	13
when	13
touched	13
by	13
her	13
hands;	13
and	13
didst	13
thou	13
look,	13
friend?	13
was	13
it	13
white	13
wheat	13
or	13
brown?”	13
“It	13
was	13
neither,	13
but	13
red,”	13
said	13
Sancho.	13
“Then	13
I	13
promise	13
thee,”	13
said	13
Don	13
Quixote,	13
“that,	13
winnowed	13
by	13
her	13
hands,	13
beyond	13
a	13
doubt	13
the	13
bread	13
it	13
made	13
was	13
of	13
the	13
whitest;	13
but	13
go	13
on;	13
when	13
thou	13
gavest	13
her	13
my	13
letter,	13
did	13
she	13
kiss	13
it?	13
Did	13
she	13
place	13
it	13
on	13
her	13
head?	13
Did	13
she	13
perform	13
any	13
ceremony	13
befitting	13
it,	13
or	13
what	13
did	13
she	13
do?”	13
“When	13
I	13
went	13
to	13
give	13
it	13
to	13
her,”	13
replied	13
Sancho,	13
“she	13
was	13
hard	13
at	13
it	13
swaying	13
from	13
side	13
to	13
side	13
with	13
a	13
lot	13
of	13
wheat	13
she	13
had	13
in	13
the	13
sieve,	13
and	13
she	13
said	13
to	13
me,	13
‘Lay	13
the	13
letter,	13
friend,	13
on	13
the	13
top	13
of	13
that	13
sack,	13
for	13
I	13
cannot	13
read	13
it	13
until	13
I	13
have	13
done	13
sifting	13
all	13
this.”	13
“Discreet	13
lady!”	13
said	13
Don	13
Quixote;	13
“that	13
was	13
in	13
order	13
to	13
read	13
it	13
at	13
her	13
leisure	13
and	13
enjoy	13
it;	13
proceed,	13
Sancho;	13
while	13
she	13
was	13
engaged	13
in	13
her	13
occupation	13
what	13
converse	13
did	13
she	13
hold	13
with	13
thee?	13
What	13
did	13
she	13
ask	13
about	13
me,	13
and	13
what	13
answer	13
didst	13
thou	13
give?	13
Make	13
haste;	13
tell	13
me	13
all,	13
and	13
let	13
not	13
an	13
atom	13
be	13
left	13
behind	13
in	13
the	13
ink-bottle.”	13
“She	13
asked	13
me	13
nothing,”	13
said	13
Sancho;	13
“but	13
I	13
told	13
her	13
how	13
your	13
worship	13
was	13
left	13
doing	13
penance	13
in	13
her	13
service,	13
naked	13
from	13
the	13
waist	13
up,	13
in	13
among	13
these	13
mountains	13
like	13
a	13
savage,	13
sleeping	13
on	13
the	13
ground,	13
not	13
eating	13
bread	13
off	13
a	13
tablecloth	13
nor	13
combing	13
your	13
beard,	13
weeping	13
and	13
cursing	13
your	13
fortune.”	13
“In	13
saying	13
I	13
cursed	13
my	13
fortune	13
thou	13
saidst	13
wrong,”	13
said	13
Don	13
Quixote;	13
“for	13
rather	13
do	13
I	13
bless	13
it	13
and	13
shall	13
bless	13
it	13
all	13
the	13
days	13
of	13
my	13
life	13
for	13
having	13
made	13
me	13
worthy	13
of	13
aspiring	13
to	13
love	13
so	13
lofty	13
a	13
lady	13
as	13
Dulcinea	13
del	13
Toboso.”	13
“And	13
so	13
lofty	13
she	13
is,”	13
said	13
Sancho,	13
“that	13
she	13
overtops	13
me	13
by	13
more	13
than	13
a	13
hand’s-breadth.”	13
“What!	13
Sancho,”	13
said	13
Don	13
Quixote,	13
“didst	13
thou	13
measure	13
with	13
her?”	13
“I	13
measured	13
in	13
this	13
way,”	13
said	13
Sancho;	13
“going	13
to	13
help	13
her	13
to	13
put	13
a	13
sack	13
of	13
wheat	13
on	13
the	13
back	13
of	13
an	13
ass,	13
we	13
came	13
so	13
close	13
together	13
that	13
I	13
could	13
see	13
she	13
stood	13
more	13
than	13
a	13
good	13
palm	13
over	13
me.”	13
“Well!”	13
said	13
Don	13
Quixote,	13
“and	13
doth	13
she	13
not	13
of	13
a	13
truth	13
accompany	13
and	13
adorn	13
this	13
greatness	13
with	13
a	13
thousand	13
million	13
charms	13
of	13
mind!	13
But	13
one	13
thing	13
thou	13
wilt	13
not	13
deny,	13
Sancho;	13
when	13
thou	13
camest	13
close	13
to	13
her	13
didst	13
thou	13
not	13
perceive	13
a	13
Sabæan	13
odour,	13
an	13
aromatic	13
fragrance,	13
a,	13
I	13
know	13
not	13
what,	13
delicious,	13
that	13
I	13
cannot	13
find	13
a	13
name	13
for;	13
I	13
mean	13
a	13
redolence,	13
an	13
exhalation,	13
as	13
if	13
thou	13
wert	13
in	13
the	13
shop	13
of	13
some	13
dainty	13
glover?”	13
“All	13
I	13
can	13
say	13
is,”	13
said	13
Sancho,	13
“that	13
I	13
did	13
perceive	13
a	13
little	13
odour,	13
something	13
goaty;	13
it	13
must	13
have	13
been	13
that	13
she	13
was	13
all	13
in	13
a	13
sweat	13
with	13
hard	13
work.”	13
“It	13
could	13
not	13
be	13
that,”	13
said	13
Don	13
Quixote,	13
“but	13
thou	13
must	13
have	13
been	13
suffering	13
from	13
cold	13
in	13
the	13
head,	13
or	13
must	13
have	13
smelt	13
thyself;	13
for	13
I	13
know	13
well	13
what	13
would	13
be	13
the	13
scent	13
of	13
that	13
rose	13
among	13
thorns,	13
that	13
lily	13
of	13
the	13
field,	13
that	13
dissolved	13
amber.”	13
“Maybe	13
so,”	13
replied	13
Sancho;	13
“there	13
often	13
comes	13
from	13
myself	13
that	13
same	13
odour	13
which	13
then	13
seemed	13
to	13
me	13
to	13
come	13
from	13
her	13
grace	13
the	13
lady	13
Dulcinea;	13
but	13
that’s	13
no	13
wonder,	13
for	13
one	13
devil	13
is	13
like	13
another.”	13
“Well	13
then,”	13
continued	13
Don	13
Quixote,	13
“now	13
she	13
has	13
done	13
sifting	13
the	13
corn	13
and	13
sent	13
it	13
to	13
the	13
mill;	13
what	13
did	13
she	13
do	13
when	13
she	13
read	13
the	13
letter?”	13
“As	13
for	13
the	13
letter,”	13
said	13
Sancho,	13
“she	13
did	13
not	13
read	13
it,	13
for	13
she	13
said	13
she	13
could	13
neither	13
read	13
nor	13
write;	13
instead	13
of	13
that	13
she	13
tore	13
it	13
up	13
into	13
small	13
pieces,	13
saying	13
that	13
she	13
did	13
not	13
want	13
to	13
let	13
anyone	13
read	13
it	13
lest	13
her	13
secrets	13
should	13
become	13
known	13
in	13
the	13
village,	13
and	13
that	13
what	13
I	13
had	13
told	13
her	13
by	13
word	13
of	13
mouth	13
about	13
the	13
love	13
your	13
worship	13
bore	13
her,	13
and	13
the	13
extraordinary	13
penance	13
you	13
were	13
doing	13
for	13
her	13
sake,	13
was	13
enough;	13
and,	13
to	13
make	13
an	13
end	13
of	13
it,	13
she	13
told	13
me	13
to	13
tell	13
your	13
worship	13
that	13
she	13
kissed	13
your	13
hands,	13
and	13
that	13
she	13
had	13
a	13
greater	13
desire	13
to	13
see	13
you	13
than	13
to	13
write	13
to	13
you;	13
and	13
that	13
therefore	13
she	13
entreated	13
and	13
commanded	13
you,	13
on	13
sight	13
of	13
this	13
present,	13
to	13
come	13
out	13
of	13
these	13
thickets,	13
and	13
to	13
have	13
done	13
with	13
carrying	13
on	13
absurdities,	13
and	13
to	13
set	13
out	13
at	13
once	13
for	13
El	13
Toboso,	13
unless	13
something	13
else	13
of	13
greater	13
importance	13
should	13
happen,	13
for	13
she	13
had	13
a	13
great	13
desire	13
to	13
see	13
your	13
worship.	13
She	13
laughed	13
greatly	13
when	13
I	13
told	13
her	13
how	13
your	13
worship	13
was	13
called	13
The	13
Knight	13
of	13
the	13
Rueful	13
Countenance;	13
I	13
asked	13
her	13
if	13
that	13
Biscayan	13
the	13
other	13
day	13
had	13
been	13
there;	13
and	13
she	13
told	13
me	13
he	13
had,	13
and	13
that	13
he	13
was	13
an	13
honest	13
fellow;	13
I	13
asked	13
her	13
too	13
about	13
the	13
galley	13
slaves,	13
but	13
she	13
said	13
she	13
had	13
not	13
seen	13
any	13
as	13
yet.”	13
“So	13
far	13
all	13
goes	13
well,”	13
said	13
Don	13
Quixote;	13
“but	13
tell	13
me	13
what	13
jewel	13
was	13
it	13
that	13
she	13
gave	13
thee	13
on	13
taking	13
thy	13
leave,	13
in	13
return	13
for	13
thy	13
tidings	13
of	13
me?	13
For	13
it	13
is	13
a	13
usual	13
and	13
ancient	13
custom	13
with	13
knights	13
and	13
ladies	13
errant	13
to	13
give	13
the	13
squires,	13
damsels,	13
or	13
dwarfs	13
who	13
bring	13
tidings	13
of	13
their	13
ladies	13
to	13
the	13
knights,	13
or	13
of	13
their	13
knights	13
to	13
the	13
ladies,	13
some	13
rich	13
jewel	13
as	13
a	13
guerdon	13
for	13
good	13
news,	13
and	13
acknowledgment	13
of	13
the	13
message.”	13
“That	13
is	13
very	13
likely,”	13
said	13
Sancho,	13
“and	13
a	13
good	13
custom	13
it	13
was,	13
to	13
my	13
mind;	13
but	13
that	13
must	13
have	13
been	13
in	13
days	13
gone	13
by,	13
for	13
now	13
it	13
would	13
seem	13
to	13
be	13
the	13
custom	13
only	13
to	13
give	13
a	13
piece	13
of	13
bread	13
and	13
cheese;	13
because	13
that	13
was	13
what	13
my	13
lady	13
Dulcinea	13
gave	13
me	13
over	13
the	13
top	13
of	13
the	13
yard-wall	13
when	13
I	13
took	13
leave	13
of	13
her;	13
and	13
more	13
by	13
token	13
it	13
was	13
sheep’s-milk	13
cheese.”	13
“She	13
is	13
generous	13
in	13
the	13
extreme,”	13
said	13
Don	13
Quixote,	13
“and	13
if	13
she	13
did	13
not	13
give	13
thee	13
a	13
jewel	13
of	13
gold,	13
no	13
doubt	13
it	13
must	13
have	13
been	13
because	13
she	13
had	13
not	13
one	13
to	13
hand	13
there	13
to	13
give	13
thee;	13
but	13
sleeves	13
are	13
good	13
after	13
Easter;	13
I	13
shall	13
see	13
her	13
and	13
all	13
shall	13
be	13
made	13
right.	13
But	13
knowest	13
thou	13
what	13
amazes	13
me,	13
Sancho?	13
It	13
seems	13
to	13
me	13
thou	13
must	13
have	13
gone	13
and	13
come	13
through	13
the	13
air,	13
for	13
thou	13
hast	13
taken	13
but	13
little	13
more	13
than	13
three	13
days	13
to	13
go	13
to	13
El	13
Toboso	13
and	13
return,	13
though	13
it	13
is	13
more	13
than	13
thirty	13
leagues	13
from	13
here	13
to	13
there.	13
From	13
which	13
I	13
am	13
inclined	13
to	13
think	13
that	13
the	13
sage	13
magician	13
who	13
is	13
my	13
friend,	13
and	13
watches	13
over	13
my	13
interests	13
(for	13
of	13
necessity	13
there	13
is	13
and	13
must	13
be	13
one,	13
or	13
else	13
I	13
should	13
not	13
be	13
a	13
right	13
knight-errant),	13
that	13
this	13
same,	13
I	13
say,	13
must	13
have	13
helped	13
thee	13
to	13
travel	13
without	13
thy	13
knowledge;	13
for	13
some	13
of	13
these	13
sages	13
will	13
catch	13
up	13
a	13
knight-errant	13
sleeping	13
in	13
his	13
bed,	13
and	13
without	13
his	13
knowing	13
how	13
or	13
in	13
what	13
way	13
it	13
happened,	13
he	13
wakes	13
up	13
the	13
next	13
day	13
more	13
than	13
a	13
thousand	13
leagues	13
away	13
from	13
the	13
place	13
where	13
he	13
went	13
to	13
sleep.	13
And	13
if	13
it	13
were	13
not	13
for	13
this,	13
knights-errant	13
would	13
not	13
be	13
able	13
to	13
give	13
aid	13
to	13
one	13
another	13
in	13
peril,	13
as	13
they	13
do	13
at	13
every	13
turn.	13
For	13
a	13
knight,	13
maybe,	13
is	13
fighting	13
in	13
the	13
mountains	13
of	13
Armenia	13
with	13
some	13
dragon,	13
or	13
fierce	13
serpent,	13
or	13
another	13
knight,	13
and	13
gets	13
the	13
worst	13
of	13
the	13
battle,	13
and	13
is	13
at	13
the	13
point	13
of	13
death;	13
but	13
when	13
he	13
least	13
looks	13
for	13
it,	13
there	13
appears	13
over	13
against	13
him	13
on	13
a	13
cloud,	13
or	13
chariot	13
of	13
fire,	13
another	13
knight,	13
a	13
friend	13
of	13
his,	13
who	13
just	13
before	13
had	13
been	13
in	13
England,	13
and	13
who	13
takes	13
his	13
part,	13
and	13
delivers	13
him	13
from	13
death;	13
and	13
at	13
night	13
he	13
finds	13
himself	13
in	13
his	13
own	13
quarters	13
supping	13
very	13
much	13
to	13
his	13
satisfaction;	13
and	13
yet	13
from	13
one	13
place	13
to	13
the	13
other	13
will	13
have	13
been	13
two	13
or	13
three	13
thousand	13
leagues.	13
And	13
all	13
this	13
is	13
done	13
by	13
the	13
craft	13
and	13
skill	13
of	13
the	13
sage	13
enchanters	13
who	13
take	13
care	13
of	13
those	13
valiant	13
knights;	13
so	13
that,	13
friend	13
Sancho,	13
I	13
find	13
no	13
difficulty	13
in	13
believing	13
that	13
thou	13
mayest	13
have	13
gone	13
from	13
this	13
place	13
to	13
El	13
Toboso	13
and	13
returned	13
in	13
such	13
a	13
short	13
time,	13
since,	13
as	13
I	13
have	13
said,	13
some	13
friendly	13
sage	13
must	13
have	13
carried	13
thee	13
through	13
the	13
air	13
without	13
thee	13
perceiving	13
it.”	13
“That	13
must	13
have	13
been	13
it,”	13
said	13
Sancho,	13
“for	13
indeed	13
Rocinante	13
went	13
like	13
a	13
gipsy’s	13
ass	13
with	13
quicksilver	13
in	13
his	13
ears.”	13
“Quicksilver!”	13
said	13
Don	13
Quixote,	13
“aye	13
and	13
what	13
is	13
more,	13
a	13
legion	13
of	13
devils,	13
folk	13
that	13
can	13
travel	13
and	13
make	13
others	13
travel	13
without	13
being	13
weary,	13
exactly	13
as	13
the	13
whim	13
seizes	13
them.	13
But	13
putting	13
this	13
aside,	13
what	13
thinkest	13
thou	13
I	13
ought	13
to	13
do	13
about	13
my	13
lady’s	13
command	13
to	13
go	13
and	13
see	13
her?	13
For	13
though	13
I	13
feel	13
that	13
I	13
am	13
bound	13
to	13
obey	13
her	13
mandate,	13
I	13
feel	13
too	13
that	13
I	13
am	13
debarred	13
by	13
the	13
boon	13
I	13
have	13
accorded	13
to	13
the	13
princess	13
that	13
accompanies	13
us,	13
and	13
the	13
law	13
of	13
chivalry	13
compels	13
me	13
to	13
have	13
regard	13
for	13
my	13
word	13
in	13
preference	13
to	13
my	13
inclination;	13
on	13
the	13
one	13
hand	13
the	13
desire	13
to	13
see	13
my	13
lady	13
pursues	13
and	13
harasses	13
me,	13
on	13
the	13
other	13
my	13
solemn	13
promise	13
and	13
the	13
glory	13
I	13
shall	13
win	13
in	13
this	13
enterprise	13
urge	13
and	13
call	13
me;	13
but	13
what	13
I	13
think	13
I	13
shall	13
do	13
is	13
to	13
travel	13
with	13
all	13
speed	13
and	13
reach	13
quickly	13
the	13
place	13
where	13
this	13
giant	13
is,	13
and	13
on	13
my	13
arrival	13
I	13
shall	13
cut	13
off	13
his	13
head,	13
and	13
establish	13
the	13
princess	13
peacefully	13
in	13
her	13
realm,	13
and	13
forthwith	13
I	13
shall	13
return	13
to	13
behold	13
the	13
light	13
that	13
lightens	13
my	13
senses,	13
to	13
whom	13
I	13
shall	13
make	13
such	13
excuses	13
that	13
she	13
will	13
be	13
led	13
to	13
approve	13
of	13
my	13
delay,	13
for	13
she	13
will	13
see	13
that	13
it	13
entirely	13
tends	13
to	13
increase	13
her	13
glory	13
and	13
fame;	13
for	13
all	13
that	13
I	13
have	13
won,	13
am	13
winning,	13
or	13
shall	13
win	13
by	13
arms	13
in	13
this	13
life,	13
comes	13
to	13
me	13
of	13
the	13
favour	13
she	13
extends	13
to	13
me,	13
and	13
because	13
I	13
am	13
hers.”	13
“Ah!	13
what	13
a	13
sad	13
state	13
your	13
worship’s	13
brains	13
are	13
in!”	13
said	13
Sancho.	13
“Tell	13
me,	13
señor,	13
do	13
you	13
mean	13
to	13
travel	13
all	13
that	13
way	13
for	13
nothing,	13
and	13
to	13
let	13
slip	13
and	13
lose	13
so	13
rich	13
and	13
great	13
a	13
match	13
as	13
this	13
where	13
they	13
give	13
as	13
a	13
portion	13
a	13
kingdom	13
that	13
in	13
sober	13
truth	13
I	13
have	13
heard	13
say	13
is	13
more	13
than	13
twenty	13
thousand	13
leagues	13
round	13
about,	13
and	13
abounds	13
with	13
all	13
things	13
necessary	13
to	13
support	13
human	13
life,	13
and	13
is	13
bigger	13
than	13
Portugal	13
and	13
Castile	13
put	13
together?	13
Peace,	13
for	13
the	13
love	13
of	13
God!	13
Blush	13
for	13
what	13
you	13
have	13
said,	13
and	13
take	13
my	13
advice,	13
and	13
forgive	13
me,	13
and	13
marry	13
at	13
once	13
in	13
the	13
first	13
village	13
where	13
there	13
is	13
a	13
curate;	13
if	13
not,	13
here	13
is	13
our	13
licentiate	13
who	13
will	13
do	13
the	13
business	13
beautifully;	13
remember,	13
I	13
am	13
old	13
enough	13
to	13
give	13
advice,	13
and	13
this	13
I	13
am	13
giving	13
comes	13
pat	13
to	13
the	13
purpose;	13
for	13
a	13
sparrow	13
in	13
the	13
hand	13
is	13
better	13
than	13
a	13
vulture	13
on	13
the	13
wing,	13
and	13
he	13
who	13
has	13
the	13
good	13
to	13
his	13
hand	13
and	13
chooses	13
the	13
bad,	13
that	13
the	13
good	13
he	13
complains	13
of	13
may	13
not	13
come	13
to	13
him.”	13
“Look	13
here,	13
Sancho,”	13
said	13
Don	13
Quixote.	13
“If	13
thou	13
art	13
advising	13
me	13
to	13
marry,	13
in	13
order	13
that	13
immediately	13
on	13
slaying	13
the	13
giant	13
I	13
may	13
become	13
king,	13
and	13
be	13
able	13
to	13
confer	13
favours	13
on	13
thee,	13
and	13
give	13
thee	13
what	13
I	13
have	13
promised,	13
let	13
me	13
tell	13
thee	13
I	13
shall	13
be	13
able	13
very	13
easily	13
to	13
satisfy	13
thy	13
desires	13
without	13
marrying;	13
for	13
before	13
going	13
into	13
battle	13
I	13
will	13
make	13
it	13
a	13
stipulation	13
that,	13
if	13
I	13
come	13
out	13
of	13
it	13
victorious,	13
even	13
I	13
do	13
not	13
marry,	13
they	13
shall	13
give	13
me	13
a	13
portion	13
of	13
the	13
kingdom,	13
that	13
I	13
may	13
bestow	13
it	13
upon	13
whomsoever	13
I	13
choose,	13
and	13
when	13
they	13
give	13
it	13
to	13
me	13
upon	13
whom	13
wouldst	13
thou	13
have	13
me	13
bestow	13
it	13
but	13
upon	13
thee?”	13
“That	13
is	13
plain	13
speaking,”	13
said	13
Sancho;	13
“but	13
let	13
your	13
worship	13
take	13
care	13
to	13
choose	13
it	13
on	13
the	13
seacoast,	13
so	13
that	13
if	13
I	13
don’t	13
like	13
the	13
life,	13
I	13
may	13
be	13
able	13
to	13
ship	13
off	13
my	13
black	13
vassals	13
and	13
deal	13
with	13
them	13
as	13
I	13
have	13
said;	13
don’t	13
mind	13
going	13
to	13
see	13
my	13
lady	13
Dulcinea	13
now,	13
but	13
go	13
and	13
kill	13
this	13
giant	13
and	13
let	13
us	13
finish	13
off	13
this	13
business;	13
for	13
by	13
God	13
it	13
strikes	13
me	13
it	13
will	13
be	13
one	13
of	13
great	13
honour	13
and	13
great	13
profit.”	13
“I	13
hold	13
thou	13
art	13
in	13
the	13
right	13
of	13
it,	13
Sancho,”	13
said	13
Don	13
Quixote,	13
“and	13
I	13
will	13
take	13
thy	13
advice	13
as	13
to	13
accompanying	13
the	13
princess	13
before	13
going	13
to	13
see	13
Dulcinea;	13
but	13
I	13
counsel	13
thee	13
not	13
to	13
say	13
anything	13
to	13
anyone,	13
or	13
to	13
those	13
who	13
are	13
with	13
us,	13
about	13
what	13
we	13
have	13
considered	13
and	13
discussed,	13
for	13
as	13
Dulcinea	13
is	13
so	13
decorous	13
that	13
she	13
does	13
not	13
wish	13
her	13
thoughts	13
to	13
be	13
known	13
it	13
is	13
not	13
right	13
that	13
I	13
or	13
anyone	13
for	13
me	13
should	13
disclose	13
them.”	13
“Well	13
then,	13
if	13
that	13
be	13
so,”	13
said	13
Sancho,	13
“how	13
is	13
it	13
that	13
your	13
worship	13
makes	13
all	13
those	13
you	13
overcome	13
by	13
your	13
arm	13
go	13
to	13
present	13
themselves	13
before	13
my	13
lady	13
Dulcinea,	13
this	13
being	13
the	13
same	13
thing	13
as	13
signing	13
your	13
name	13
to	13
it	13
that	13
you	13
love	13
her	13
and	13
are	13
her	13
lover?	13
And	13
as	13
those	13
who	13
go	13
must	13
perforce	13
kneel	13
before	13
her	13
and	13
say	13
they	13
come	13
from	13
your	13
worship	13
to	13
submit	13
themselves	13
to	13
her,	13
how	13
can	13
the	13
thoughts	13
of	13
both	13
of	13
you	13
be	13
hid?”	13
“O,	13
how	13
silly	13
and	13
simple	13
thou	13
art!”	13
said	13
Don	13
Quixote;	13
“seest	13
thou	13
not,	13
Sancho,	13
that	13
this	13
tends	13
to	13
her	13
greater	13
exaltation?	13
For	13
thou	13
must	13
know	13
that	13
according	13
to	13
our	13
way	13
of	13
thinking	13
in	13
chivalry,	13
it	13
is	13
a	13
high	13
honour	13
to	13
a	13
lady	13
to	13
have	13
many	13
knights-errant	13
in	13
her	13
service,	13
whose	13
thoughts	13
never	13
go	13
beyond	13
serving	13
her	13
for	13
her	13
own	13
sake,	13
and	13
who	13
look	13
for	13
no	13
other	13
reward	13
for	13
their	13
great	13
and	13
true	13
devotion	13
than	13
that	13
she	13
should	13
be	13
willing	13
to	13
accept	13
them	13
as	13
her	13
knights.”	13
“It	13
is	13
with	13
that	13
kind	13
of	13
love,”	13
said	13
Sancho,	13
“I	13
have	13
heard	13
preachers	13
say	13
we	13
ought	13
to	13
love	13
our	13
Lord,	13
for	13
himself	13
alone,	13
without	13
being	13
moved	13
by	13
the	13
hope	13
of	13
glory	13
or	13
the	13
fear	13
of	13
punishment;	13
though	13
for	13
my	13
part,	13
I	13
would	13
rather	13
love	13
and	13
serve	13
him	13
for	13
what	13
he	13
could	13
do.”	13
“The	13
devil	13
take	13
thee	13
for	13
a	13
clown!”	13
said	13
Don	13
Quixote,	13
“and	13
what	13
shrewd	13
things	13
thou	13
sayest	13
at	13
times!	13
One	13
would	13
think	13
thou	13
hadst	13
studied.”	13
“In	13
faith,	13
then,	13
I	13
cannot	13
even	13
read.”	13
Master	13
Nicholas	13
here	13
called	13
out	13
to	13
them	13
to	13
wait	13
a	13
while,	13
as	13
they	13
wanted	13
to	13
halt	13
and	13
drink	13
at	13
a	13
little	13
spring	13
there	13
was	13
there.	13
Don	13
Quixote	13
drew	13
up,	13
not	13
a	13
little	13
to	13
the	13
satisfaction	13
of	13
Sancho,	13
for	13
he	13
was	13
by	13
this	13
time	13
weary	13
of	13
telling	13
so	13
many	13
lies,	13
and	13
in	13
dread	13
of	13
his	13
master	13
catching	13
him	13
tripping,	13
for	13
though	13
he	13
knew	13
that	13
Dulcinea	13
was	13
a	13
peasant	13
girl	13
of	13
El	13
Toboso,	13
he	13
had	13
never	13
seen	13
her	13
in	13
all	13
his	13
life.	13
Cardenio	13
had	13
now	13
put	13
on	13
the	13
clothes	13
which	13
Dorothea	13
was	13
wearing	13
when	13
they	13
found	13
her,	13
and	13
though	13
they	13
were	13
not	13
very	13
good,	13
they	13
were	13
far	13
better	13
than	13
those	13
he	13
put	13
off.	13
They	13
dismounted	13
together	13
by	13
the	13
side	13
of	13
the	13
spring,	13
and	13
with	13
what	13
the	13
curate	13
had	13
provided	13
himself	13
with	13
at	13
the	13
inn	13
they	13
appeased,	13
though	13
not	13
very	13
well,	13
the	13
keen	13
appetite	13
they	13
all	13
of	13
them	13
brought	13
with	13
them.	13
While	13
they	13
were	13
so	13
employed	13
there	13
happened	13
to	13
come	13
by	13
a	13
youth	13
passing	13
on	13
his	13
way,	13
who	13
stopping	13
to	13
examine	13
the	13
party	13
at	13
the	13
spring,	13
the	13
next	13
moment	13
ran	13
to	13
Don	13
Quixote	13
and	13
clasping	13
him	13
round	13
the	13
legs,	13
began	13
to	13
weep	13
freely,	13
saying,	13
“O,	13
señor,	13
do	13
you	13
not	13
know	13
me?	13
Look	13
at	13
me	13
well;	13
I	13
am	13
that	13
lad	13
Andres	13
that	13
your	13
worship	13
released	13
from	13
the	13
oak-tree	13
where	13
I	13
was	13
tied.”	13
Don	13
Quixote	13
recognised	13
him,	13
and	13
taking	13
his	13
hand	13
he	13
turned	13
to	13
those	13
present	13
and	13
said:	13
“That	13
your	13
worships	13
may	13
see	13
how	13
important	13
it	13
is	13
to	13
have	13
knights-errant	13
to	13
redress	13
the	13
wrongs	13
and	13
injuries	13
done	13
by	13
tyrannical	13
and	13
wicked	13
men	13
in	13
this	13
world,	13
I	13
may	13
tell	13
you	13
that	13
some	13
days	13
ago	13
passing	13
through	13
a	13
wood,	13
I	13
heard	13
cries	13
and	13
piteous	13
complaints	13
as	13
of	13
a	13
person	13
in	13
pain	13
and	13
distress;	13
I	13
immediately	13
hastened,	13
impelled	13
by	13
my	13
bounden	13
duty,	13
to	13
the	13
quarter	13
whence	13
the	13
plaintive	13
accents	13
seemed	13
to	13
me	13
to	13
proceed,	13
and	13
I	13
found	13
tied	13
to	13
an	13
oak	13
this	13
lad	13
who	13
now	13
stands	13
before	13
you,	13
which	13
in	13
my	13
heart	13
I	13
rejoice	13
at,	13
for	13
his	13
testimony	13
will	13
not	13
permit	13
me	13
to	13
depart	13
from	13
the	13
truth	13
in	13
any	13
particular.	13
He	13
was,	13
I	13
say,	13
tied	13
to	13
an	13
oak,	13
naked	13
from	13
the	13
waist	13
up,	13
and	13
a	13
clown,	13
whom	13
I	13
afterwards	13
found	13
to	13
be	13
his	13
master,	13
was	13
scarifying	13
him	13
by	13
lashes	13
with	13
the	13
reins	13
of	13
his	13
mare.	13
As	13
soon	13
as	13
I	13
saw	13
him	13
I	13
asked	13
the	13
reason	13
of	13
so	13
cruel	13
a	13
flagellation.	13
The	13
boor	13
replied	13
that	13
he	13
was	13
flogging	13
him	13
because	13
he	13
was	13
his	13
servant	13
and	13
because	13
of	13
carelessness	13
that	13
proceeded	13
rather	13
from	13
dishonesty	13
than	13
stupidity;	13
on	13
which	13
this	13
boy	13
said,	13
‘Señor,	13
he	13
flogs	13
me	13
only	13
because	13
I	13
ask	13
for	13
my	13
wages.’	13
The	13
master	13
made	13
I	13
know	13
not	13
what	13
speeches	13
and	13
explanations,	13
which,	13
though	13
I	13
listened	13
to	13
them,	13
I	13
did	13
not	13
accept.	13
In	13
short,	13
I	13
compelled	13
the	13
clown	13
to	13
unbind	13
him,	13
and	13
to	13
swear	13
he	13
would	13
take	13
him	13
with	13
him,	13
and	13
pay	13
him	13
real	13
by	13
real,	13
and	13
perfumed	13
into	13
the	13
bargain.	13
Is	13
not	13
all	13
this	13
true,	13
Andres	13
my	13
son?	13
Didst	13
thou	13
not	13
mark	13
with	13
what	13
authority	13
I	13
commanded	13
him,	13
and	13
with	13
what	13
humility	13
he	13
promised	13
to	13
do	13
all	13
I	13
enjoined,	13
specified,	13
and	13
required	13
of	13
him?	13
Answer	13
without	13
hesitation;	13
tell	13
these	13
gentlemen	13
what	13
took	13
place,	13
that	13
they	13
may	13
see	13
that	13
it	13
is	13
as	13
great	13
an	13
advantage	13
as	13
I	13
say	13
to	13
have	13
knights-errant	13
abroad.”	13
“All	13
that	13
your	13
worship	13
has	13
said	13
is	13
quite	13
true,”	13
answered	13
the	13
lad;	13
“but	13
the	13
end	13
of	13
the	13
business	13
turned	13
out	13
just	13
the	13
opposite	13
of	13
what	13
your	13
worship	13
supposes.”	13
“How!	13
the	13
opposite?”	13
said	13
Don	13
Quixote;	13
“did	13
not	13
the	13
clown	13
pay	13
thee	13
then?”	13
“Not	13
only	13
did	13
he	13
not	13
pay	13
me,”	13
replied	13
the	13
lad,	13
“but	13
as	13
soon	13
as	13
your	13
worship	13
had	13
passed	13
out	13
of	13
the	13
wood	13
and	13
we	13
were	13
alone,	13
he	13
tied	13
me	13
up	13
again	13
to	13
the	13
same	13
oak	13
and	13
gave	13
me	13
a	13
fresh	13
flogging,	13
that	13
left	13
me	13
like	13
a	13
flayed	13
Saint	13
Bartholomew;	13
and	13
every	13
stroke	13
he	13
gave	13
me	13
he	13
followed	13
up	13
with	13
some	13
jest	13
or	13
gibe	13
about	13
having	13
made	13
a	13
fool	13
of	13
your	13
worship,	13
and	13
but	13
for	13
the	13
pain	13
I	13
was	13
suffering	13
I	13
should	13
have	13
laughed	13
at	13
the	13
things	13
he	13
said.	13
In	13
short	13
he	13
left	13
me	13
in	13
such	13
a	13
condition	13
that	13
I	13
have	13
been	13
until	13
now	13
in	13
a	13
hospital	13
getting	13
cured	13
of	13
the	13
injuries	13
which	13
that	13
rascally	13
clown	13
inflicted	13
on	13
me	13
then;	13
for	13
all	13
which	13
your	13
worship	13
is	13
to	13
blame;	13
for	13
if	13
you	13
had	13
gone	13
your	13
own	13
way	13
and	13
not	13
come	13
where	13
there	13
was	13
no	13
call	13
for	13
you,	13
nor	13
meddled	13
in	13
other	13
people’s	13
affairs,	13
my	13
master	13
would	13
have	13
been	13
content	13
with	13
giving	13
me	13
one	13
or	13
two	13
dozen	13
lashes,	13
and	13
would	13
have	13
then	13
loosed	13
me	13
and	13
paid	13
me	13
what	13
he	13
owed	13
me;	13
but	13
when	13
your	13
worship	13
abused	13
him	13
so	13
out	13
of	13
measure,	13
and	13
gave	13
him	13
so	13
many	13
hard	13
words,	13
his	13
anger	13
was	13
kindled;	13
and	13
as	13
he	13
could	13
not	13
revenge	13
himself	13
on	13
you,	13
as	13
soon	13
as	13
he	13
saw	13
you	13
had	13
left	13
him	13
the	13
storm	13
burst	13
upon	13
me	13
in	13
such	13
a	13
way,	13
that	13
I	13
feel	13
as	13
if	13
I	13
should	13
never	13
be	13
a	13
man	13
again.”	13
“The	13
mischief,”	13
said	13
Don	13
Quixote,	13
“lay	13
in	13
my	13
going	13
away;	13
for	13
I	13
should	13
not	13
have	13
gone	13
until	13
I	13
had	13
seen	13
thee	13
paid;	13
because	13
I	13
ought	13
to	13
have	13
known	13
well	13
by	13
long	13
experience	13
that	13
there	13
is	13
no	13
clown	13
who	13
will	13
keep	13
his	13
word	13
if	13
he	13
finds	13
it	13
will	13
not	13
suit	13
him	13
to	13
keep	13
it;	13
but	13
thou	13
rememberest,	13
Andres,	13
that	13
I	13
swore	13
if	13
he	13
did	13
not	13
pay	13
thee	13
I	13
would	13
go	13
and	13
seek	13
him,	13
and	13
find	13
him	13
though	13
he	13
were	13
to	13
hide	13
himself	13
in	13
the	13
whale’s	13
belly.”	13
“That	13
is	13
true,”	13
said	13
Andres;	13
“but	13
it	13
was	13
of	13
no	13
use.”	13
“Thou	13
shalt	13
see	13
now	13
whether	13
it	13
is	13
of	13
use	13
or	13
not,”	13
said	13
Don	13
Quixote;	13
and	13
so	13
saying,	13
he	13
got	13
up	13
hastily	13
and	13
bade	13
Sancho	13
bridle	13
Rocinante,	13
who	13
was	13
browsing	13
while	13
they	13
were	13
eating.	13
Dorothea	13
asked	13
him	13
what	13
he	13
meant	13
to	13
do.	13
He	13
replied	13
that	13
he	13
meant	13
to	13
go	13
in	13
search	13
of	13
this	13
clown	13
and	13
chastise	13
him	13
for	13
such	13
iniquitous	13
conduct,	13
and	13
see	13
Andres	13
paid	13
to	13
the	13
last	13
maravedi,	13
despite	13
and	13
in	13
the	13
teeth	13
of	13
all	13
the	13
clowns	13
in	13
the	13
world.	13
To	13
which	13
she	13
replied	13
that	13
he	13
must	13
remember	13
that	13
in	13
accordance	13
with	13
his	13
promise	13
he	13
could	13
not	13
engage	13
in	13
any	13
enterprise	13
until	13
he	13
had	13
concluded	13
hers;	13
and	13
that	13
as	13
he	13
knew	13
this	13
better	13
than	13
anyone,	13
he	13
should	13
restrain	13
his	13
ardour	13
until	13
his	13
return	13
from	13
her	13
kingdom.	13
“That	13
is	13
true,”	13
said	13
Don	13
Quixote,	13
“and	13
Andres	13
must	13
have	13
patience	13
until	13
my	13
return	13
as	13
you	13
say,	13
señora;	13
but	13
I	13
once	13
more	13
swear	13
and	13
promise	13
not	13
to	13
stop	13
until	13
I	13
have	13
seen	13
him	13
avenged	13
and	13
paid.”	13
“I	13
have	13
no	13
faith	13
in	13
those	13
oaths,”	13
said	13
Andres;	13
“I	13
would	13
rather	13
have	13
now	13
something	13
to	13
help	13
me	13
to	13
get	13
to	13
Seville	13
than	13
all	13
the	13
revenges	13
in	13
the	13
world;	13
if	13
you	13
have	13
here	13
anything	13
to	13
eat	13
that	13
I	13
can	13
take	13
with	13
me,	13
give	13
it	13
me,	13
and	13
God	13
be	13
with	13
your	13
worship	13
and	13
all	13
knights-errant;	13
and	13
may	13
their	13
errands	13
turn	13
out	13
as	13
well	13
for	13
themselves	13
as	13
they	13
have	13
for	13
me.”	13
Sancho	13
took	13
out	13
from	13
his	13
store	13
a	13
piece	13
of	13
bread	13
and	13
another	13
of	13
cheese,	13
and	13
giving	13
them	13
to	13
the	13
lad	13
he	13
said,	13
“Here,	13
take	13
this,	13
brother	13
Andres,	13
for	13
we	13
have	13
all	13
of	13
us	13
a	13
share	13
in	13
your	13
misfortune.”	13
“Why,	13
what	13
share	13
have	13
you	13
got?”	13
“This	13
share	13
of	13
bread	13
and	13
cheese	13
I	13
am	13
giving	13
you,”	13
answered	13
Sancho;	13
“and	13
God	13
knows	13
whether	13
I	13
shall	13
feel	13
the	13
want	13
of	13
it	13
myself	13
or	13
not;	13
for	13
I	13
would	13
have	13
you	13
know,	13
friend,	13
that	13
we	13
squires	13
to	13
knights-errant	13
have	13
to	13
bear	13
a	13
great	13
deal	13
of	13
hunger	13
and	13
hard	13
fortune,	13
and	13
even	13
other	13
things	13
more	13
easily	13
felt	13
than	13
told.”	13
Andres	13
seized	13
his	13
bread	13
and	13
cheese,	13
and	13
seeing	13
that	13
nobody	13
gave	13
him	13
anything	13
more,	13
bent	13
his	13
head,	13
and	13
took	13
hold	13
of	13
the	13
road,	13
as	13
the	13
saying	13
is.	13
However,	13
before	13
leaving	13
he	13
said,	13
“For	13
the	13
love	13
of	13
God,	13
sir	13
knight-errant,	13
if	13
you	13
ever	13
meet	13
me	13
again,	13
though	13
you	13
may	13
see	13
them	13
cutting	13
me	13
to	13
pieces,	13
give	13
me	13
no	13
aid	13
or	13
succour,	13
but	13
leave	13
me	13
to	13
my	13
misfortune,	13
which	13
will	13
not	13
be	13
so	13
great	13
but	13
that	13
a	13
greater	13
will	13
come	13
to	13
me	13
by	13
being	13
helped	13
by	13
your	13
worship,	13
on	13
whom	13
and	13
all	13
the	13
knights-errant	13
that	13
have	13
ever	13
been	13
born	13
God	13
send	13
his	13
curse.”	13
Don	13
Quixote	13
was	13
getting	13
up	13
to	13
chastise	13
him,	13
but	13
he	13
took	13
to	13
his	13
heels	13
at	13
such	13
a	13
pace	13
that	13
no	13
one	13
attempted	13
to	13
follow	13
him;	13
and	13
mightily	13
chapfallen	13
was	13
Don	13
Quixote	13
at	13
Andres’	13
story,	13
and	13
the	13
others	13
had	13
to	13
take	13
great	13
care	13
to	13
restrain	13
their	13
laughter	13
so	13
as	13
not	13
to	13
put	13
him	13
entirely	13
out	13
of	13
countenance.	13

WHAT	13
BEFELL	13
DON	13
QUIXOTE’S	13
PARTY	13
AT	13
THE	13
INN	13
c32a.jpg	13
(132K)	13
Full	13
Size	13
Their	13
dainty	13
repast	13
being	13
finished,	13
they	13
saddled	13
at	13
once,	13
and	13
without	13
any	13
adventure	13
worth	13
mentioning	13
they	13
reached	13
next	13
day	13
the	13
inn,	13
the	13
object	13
of	13
Sancho	13
Panza’s	13
fear	13
and	13
dread;	13
but	13
though	13
he	13
would	13
have	13
rather	13
not	13
entered	13
it,	13
there	13
was	13
no	13
help	13
for	13
it.	13
The	13
landlady,	13
the	13
landlord,	13
their	13
daughter,	13
and	13
Maritornes,	13
when	13
they	13
saw	13
Don	13
Quixote	13
and	13
Sancho	13
coming,	13
went	13
out	13
to	13
welcome	13
them	13
with	13
signs	13
of	13
hearty	13
satisfaction,	13
which	13
Don	13
Quixote	13
received	13
with	13
dignity	13
and	13
gravity,	13
and	13
bade	13
them	13
make	13
up	13
a	13
better	13
bed	13
for	13
him	13
than	13
the	13
last	13
time:	13
to	13
which	13
the	13
landlady	13
replied	13
that	13
if	13
he	13
paid	13
better	13
than	13
he	13
did	13
the	13
last	13
time	13
she	13
would	13
give	13
him	13
one	13
fit	13
for	13
a	13
prince.	13
Don	13
Quixote	13
said	13
he	13
would,	13
so	13
they	13
made	13
up	13
a	13
tolerable	13
one	13
for	13
him	13
in	13
the	13
same	13
garret	13
as	13
before;	13
and	13
he	13
lay	13
down	13
at	13
once,	13
being	13
sorely	13
shaken	13
and	13
in	13
want	13
of	13
sleep.	13
No	13
sooner	13
was	13
the	13
door	13
shut	13
upon	13
him	13
than	13
the	13
landlady	13
made	13
at	13
the	13
barber,	13
and	13
seizing	13
him	13
by	13
the	13
beard,	13
said:	13
“By	13
my	13
faith	13
you	13
are	13
not	13
going	13
to	13
make	13
a	13
beard	13
of	13
my	13
tail	13
any	13
longer;	13
you	13
must	13
give	13
me	13
back	13
my	13
tail,	13
for	13
it	13
is	13
a	13
shame	13
the	13
way	13
that	13
thing	13
of	13
my	13
husband’s	13
goes	13
tossing	13
about	13
on	13
the	13
floor;	13
I	13
mean	13
the	13
comb	13
that	13
I	13
used	13
to	13
stick	13
in	13
my	13
good	13
tail.”	13
But	13
for	13
all	13
she	13
tugged	13
at	13
it	13
the	13
barber	13
would	13
not	13
give	13
it	13
up	13
until	13
the	13
licentiate	13
told	13
him	13
to	13
let	13
her	13
have	13
it,	13
as	13
there	13
was	13
now	13
no	13
further	13
occasion	13
for	13
that	13
stratagem,	13
because	13
he	13
might	13
declare	13
himself	13
and	13
appear	13
in	13
his	13
own	13
character,	13
and	13
tell	13
Don	13
Quixote	13
that	13
he	13
had	13
fled	13
to	13
this	13
inn	13
when	13
those	13
thieves	13
the	13
galley	13
slaves	13
robbed	13
him;	13
and	13
should	13
he	13
ask	13
for	13
the	13
princess’s	13
squire,	13
they	13
could	13
tell	13
him	13
that	13
she	13
had	13
sent	13
him	13
on	13
before	13
her	13
to	13
give	13
notice	13
to	13
the	13
people	13
of	13
her	13
kingdom	13
that	13
she	13
was	13
coming,	13
and	13
bringing	13
with	13
her	13
the	13
deliverer	13
of	13
them	13
all.	13
On	13
this	13
the	13
barber	13
cheerfully	13
restored	13
the	13
tail	13
to	13
the	13
landlady,	13
and	13
at	13
the	13
same	13
time	13
they	13
returned	13
all	13
the	13
accessories	13
they	13
had	13
borrowed	13
to	13
effect	13
Don	13
Quixote’s	13
deliverance.	13
All	13
the	13
people	13
of	13
the	13
inn	13
were	13
struck	13
with	13
astonishment	13
at	13
the	13
beauty	13
of	13
Dorothea,	13
and	13
even	13
at	13
the	13
comely	13
figure	13
of	13
the	13
shepherd	13
Cardenio.	13
The	13
curate	13
made	13
them	13
get	13
ready	13
such	13
fare	13
as	13
there	13
was	13
in	13
the	13
inn,	13
and	13
the	13
landlord,	13
in	13
hope	13
of	13
better	13
payment,	13
served	13
them	13
up	13
a	13
tolerably	13
good	13
dinner.	13
All	13
this	13
time	13
Don	13
Quixote	13
was	13
asleep,	13
and	13
they	13
thought	13
it	13
best	13
not	13
to	13
waken	13
him,	13
as	13
sleeping	13
would	13
now	13
do	13
him	13
more	13
good	13
than	13
eating.	13
While	13
at	13
dinner,	13
the	13
company	13
consisting	13
of	13
the	13
landlord,	13
his	13
wife,	13
their	13
daughter,	13
Maritornes,	13
and	13
all	13
the	13
travellers,	13
they	13
discussed	13
the	13
strange	13
craze	13
of	13
Don	13
Quixote	13
and	13
the	13
manner	13
in	13
which	13
he	13
had	13
been	13
found;	13
and	13
the	13
landlady	13
told	13
them	13
what	13
had	13
taken	13
place	13
between	13
him	13
and	13
the	13
carrier;	13
and	13
then,	13
looking	13
round	13
to	13
see	13
if	13
Sancho	13
was	13
there,	13
when	13
she	13
saw	13
he	13
was	13
not,	13
she	13
gave	13
them	13
the	13
whole	13
story	13
of	13
his	13
blanketing,	13
which	13
they	13
received	13
with	13
no	13
little	13
amusement.	13
But	13
on	13
the	13
curate	13
observing	13
that	13
it	13
was	13
the	13
books	13
of	13
chivalry	13
which	13
Don	13
Quixote	13
had	13
read	13
that	13
had	13
turned	13
his	13
brain,	13
the	13
landlord	13
said:	13
“I	13
cannot	13
understand	13
how	13
that	13
can	13
be,	13
for	13
in	13
truth	13
to	13
my	13
mind	13
there	13
is	13
no	13
better	13
reading	13
in	13
the	13
world,	13
and	13
I	13
have	13
here	13
two	13
or	13
three	13
of	13
them,	13
with	13
other	13
writings	13
that	13
are	13
the	13
very	13
life,	13
not	13
only	13
of	13
myself	13
but	13
of	13
plenty	13
more;	13
for	13
when	13
it	13
is	13
harvest-time,	13
the	13
reapers	13
flock	13
here	13
on	13
holidays,	13
and	13
there	13
is	13
always	13
one	13
among	13
them	13
who	13
can	13
read	13
and	13
who	13
takes	13
up	13
one	13
of	13
these	13
books,	13
and	13
we	13
gather	13
round	13
him,	13
thirty	13
or	13
more	13
of	13
us,	13
and	13
stay	13
listening	13
to	13
him	13
with	13
a	13
delight	13
that	13
makes	13
our	13
grey	13
hairs	13
grow	13
young	13
again.	13
At	13
least	13
I	13
can	13
say	13
for	13
myself	13
that	13
when	13
I	13
hear	13
of	13
what	13
furious	13
and	13
terrible	13
blows	13
the	13
knights	13
deliver,	13
I	13
am	13
seized	13
with	13
the	13
longing	13
to	13
do	13
the	13
same,	13
and	13
I	13
would	13
like	13
to	13
be	13
hearing	13
about	13
them	13
night	13
and	13
day.”	13
“And	13
I	13
just	13
as	13
much,”	13
said	13
the	13
landlady,	13
“because	13
I	13
never	13
have	13
a	13
quiet	13
moment	13
in	13
my	13
house	13
except	13
when	13
you	13
are	13
listening	13
to	13
someone	13
reading;	13
for	13
then	13
you	13
are	13
so	13
taken	13
up	13
that	13
for	13
the	13
time	13
being	13
you	13
forget	13
to	13
scold.”	13
“That	13
is	13
true,”	13
said	13
Maritornes;	13
“and,	13
faith,	13
I	13
relish	13
hearing	13
these	13
things	13
greatly	13
too,	13
for	13
they	13
are	13
very	13
pretty;	13
especially	13
when	13
they	13
describe	13
some	13
lady	13
or	13
another	13
in	13
the	13
arms	13
of	13
her	13
knight	13
under	13
the	13
orange	13
trees,	13
and	13
the	13
duenna	13
who	13
is	13
keeping	13
watch	13
for	13
them	13
half	13
dead	13
with	13
envy	13
and	13
fright;	13
all	13
this	13
I	13
say	13
is	13
as	13
good	13
as	13
honey.”	13
“And	13
you,	13
what	13
do	13
you	13
think,	13
young	13
lady?”	13
said	13
the	13
curate	13
turning	13
to	13
the	13
landlord’s	13
daughter.	13
“I	13
don’t	13
know	13
indeed,	13
señor,”	13
said	13
she;	13
“I	13
listen	13
too,	13
and	13
to	13
tell	13
the	13
truth,	13
though	13
I	13
do	13
not	13
understand	13
it,	13
I	13
like	13
hearing	13
it;	13
but	13
it	13
is	13
not	13
the	13
blows	13
that	13
my	13
father	13
likes	13
that	13
I	13
like,	13
but	13
the	13
laments	13
the	13
knights	13
utter	13
when	13
they	13
are	13
separated	13
from	13
their	13
ladies;	13
and	13
indeed	13
they	13
sometimes	13
make	13
me	13
weep	13
with	13
the	13
pity	13
I	13
feel	13
for	13
them.”	13
“Then	13
you	13
would	13
console	13
them	13
if	13
it	13
was	13
for	13
you	13
they	13
wept,	13
young	13
lady?”	13
said	13
Dorothea.	13
“I	13
don’t	13
know	13
what	13
I	13
should	13
do,”	13
said	13
the	13
girl;	13
“I	13
only	13
know	13
that	13
there	13
are	13
some	13
of	13
those	13
ladies	13
so	13
cruel	13
that	13
they	13
call	13
their	13
knights	13
tigers	13
and	13
lions	13
and	13
a	13
thousand	13
other	13
foul	13
names:	13
and	13
Jesus!	13
I	13
don’t	13
know	13
what	13
sort	13
of	13
folk	13
they	13
can	13
be,	13
so	13
unfeeling	13
and	13
heartless,	13
that	13
rather	13
than	13
bestow	13
a	13
glance	13
upon	13
a	13
worthy	13
man	13
they	13
leave	13
him	13
to	13
die	13
or	13
go	13
mad.	13
I	13
don’t	13
know	13
what	13
is	13
the	13
good	13
of	13
such	13
prudery;	13
if	13
it	13
is	13
for	13
honour’s	13
sake,	13
why	13
not	13
marry	13
them?	13
That’s	13
all	13
they	13
want.”	13
“Hush,	13
child,”	13
said	13
the	13
landlady;	13
“it	13
seems	13
to	13
me	13
thou	13
knowest	13
a	13
great	13
deal	13
about	13
these	13
things,	13
and	13
it	13
is	13
not	13
fit	13
for	13
girls	13
to	13
know	13
or	13
talk	13
so	13
much.”	13
“As	13
the	13
gentleman	13
asked	13
me,	13
I	13
could	13
not	13
help	13
answering	13
him,”	13
said	13
the	13
girl.	13
“Well	13
then,”	13
said	13
the	13
curate,	13
“bring	13
me	13
these	13
books,	13
señor	13
landlord,	13
for	13
I	13
should	13
like	13
to	13
see	13
them.”	13
“With	13
all	13
my	13
heart,”	13
said	13
he,	13
and	13
going	13
into	13
his	13
own	13
room	13
he	13
brought	13
out	13
an	13
old	13
valise	13
secured	13
with	13
a	13
little	13
chain,	13
on	13
opening	13
which	13
the	13
curate	13
found	13
in	13
it	13
three	13
large	13
books	13
and	13
some	13
manuscripts	13
written	13
in	13
a	13
very	13
good	13
hand.	13
The	13
first	13
that	13
he	13
opened	13
he	13
found	13
to	13
be	13
“Don	13
Cirongilio	13
of	13
Thrace,”	13
and	13
the	13
second	13
“Don	13
Felixmarte	13
of	13
Hircania,”	13
and	13
the	13
other	13
the	13
“History	13
of	13
the	13
Great	13
Captain	13
Gonzalo	13
Hernandez	13
de	13
Cordova,	13
with	13
the	13
Life	13
of	13
Diego	13
García	13
de	13
Paredes.”	13
When	13
the	13
curate	13
read	13
the	13
two	13
first	13
titles	13
he	13
looked	13
over	13
at	13
the	13
barber	13
and	13
said,	13
“We	13
want	13
my	13
friend’s	13
housekeeper	13
and	13
niece	13
here	13
now.”	13
“Nay,”	13
said	13
the	13
barber,	13
“I	13
can	13
do	13
just	13
as	13
well	13
to	13
carry	13
them	13
to	13
the	13
yard	13
or	13
to	13
the	13
hearth,	13
and	13
there	13
is	13
a	13
very	13
good	13
fire	13
there.”	13
“What!	13
your	13
worship	13
would	13
burn	13
my	13
books!”	13
said	13
the	13
landlord.	13
“Only	13
these	13
two,”	13
said	13
the	13
curate,	13
“Don	13
Cirongilio,	13
and	13
Felixmarte.”	13
“Are	13
my	13
books,	13
then,	13
heretics	13
or	13
phlegmatics	13
that	13
you	13
want	13
to	13
burn	13
them?”	13
said	13
the	13
landlord.	13
“Schismatics	13
you	13
mean,	13
friend,”	13
said	13
the	13
barber,	13
“not	13
phlegmatics.”	13
“That’s	13
it,”	13
said	13
the	13
landlord;	13
“but	13
if	13
you	13
want	13
to	13
burn	13
any,	13
let	13
it	13
be	13
that	13
about	13
the	13
Great	13
Captain	13
and	13
that	13
Diego	13
García;	13
for	13
I	13
would	13
rather	13
have	13
a	13
child	13
of	13
mine	13
burnt	13
than	13
either	13
of	13
the	13
others.”	13
“Brother,”	13
said	13
the	13
curate,	13
“those	13
two	13
books	13
are	13
made	13
up	13
of	13
lies,	13
and	13
are	13
full	13
of	13
folly	13
and	13
nonsense;	13
but	13
this	13
of	13
the	13
Great	13
Captain	13
is	13
a	13
true	13
history,	13
and	13
contains	13
the	13
deeds	13
of	13
Gonzalo	13
Hernandez	13
of	13
Cordova,	13
who	13
by	13
his	13
many	13
and	13
great	13
achievements	13
earned	13
the	13
title	13
all	13
over	13
the	13
world	13
of	13
the	13
Great	13
Captain,	13
a	13
famous	13
and	13
illustrious	13
name,	13
and	13
deserved	13
by	13
him	13
alone;	13
and	13
this	13
Diego	13

was	13
a	13
distinguished	13
knight	13
of	13
the	13

of	13
Trujillo	13
in	13
Estremadura,	13
a	13
most	13
gallant	13
soldier,	13
and	13
of	13
such	13
bodily	13
strength	13
that	13
with	13
one	13
finger	13
he	13
stopped	13
a	13
mill-wheel	13
in	13
full	13
motion;	13
and	13
posted	13
with	13
a	13
two-handed	13
sword	13
at	13
the	13
foot	13
of	13
a	13
bridge	13
he	13
kept	13
the	13
whole	13
of	13
an	13
immense	13
army	13
from	13
passing	13
over	13
it,	13
and	13
achieved	13
such	13
other	13
exploits	13

his	13
relating	13

some	13
free	13

thrown	13
into	13

all	13
the	13
deeds	13

the	13
Hectors,	13
Achilleses,	13

Rolands.”	13

Stopping	13

By	13

your	13

and	13
another	13

he	13
attacked	13
a	13
very	13

armed	13

what	13

you	13

Cirongilio	13
of	13
Thrace,	13
that	13
was	13
so	13
stout	13

bold;	13
as	13
may	13
be	13
seen	13
in	13
the	13

where	13
it	13
is	13

that	13
as	13

flung	13

got	13
astride	13

with	13
such	13

that	13
the	13

finding	13

throttling	13
it,	13
had	13
nothing	13

to	13

would	13
not	13
let	13
go	13
his	13
hold;	13
and	13
when	13
they	13
got	13
down	13
there	13
he	13
found	13
himself	13
among	13
palaces	13
and	13
gardens	13
so	13
pretty	13
that	13
it	13
was	13
a	13
wonder	13
to	13
see;	13
and	13
then	13
the	13
serpent	13
changed	13
itself	13
into	13
an	13
old	13
ancient	13
man,	13
who	13
told	13
him	13
such	13
things	13

Hold	13

for	13
if	13
you	13
were	13
to	13
hear	13
this	13
you	13

A	13

of	13

for	13
your	13
Great	13
Captain	13

Hearing	13
this	13
Dorothea	13
said	13
in	13
a	13
whisper	13
to	13
Cardenio,	13
“Our	13
landlord	13
is	13
almost	13
fit	13
to	13
play	13
a	13
second	13
part	13
to	13
Don	13
Quixote.”	13
“I	13
think	13
so,”	13
said	13
Cardenio,	13
“for,	13
as	13
he	13
shows,	13
he	13
accepts	13
it	13
as	13
a	13
certainty	13
that	13
everything	13
those	13
books	13
relate	13
took	13
place	13
exactly	13
as	13
it	13
is	13
written	13
down;	13
and	13
the	13
barefooted	13
friars	13
themselves	13
would	13
not	13
persuade	13
him	13
to	13
the	13
contrary.”	13
“But	13
consider,	13
brother,”	13
said	13
the	13
curate	13
once	13
more,	13
“there	13
never	13

world,	13
and	13
no	13
such	13
exploits	13
or	13
nonsense	13
ever	13
happened	13
anywhere.”	13
“Try	13
that	13
bone	13
on	13
another	13
dog,”	13
said	13
the	13
landlord;	13
“as	13
if	13
I	13
did	13
not	13
know	13
how	13
many	13
make	13
five,	13
and	13
where	13
my	13
shoe	13
pinches	13
me;	13
don’t	13
think	13
to	13
feed	13
me	13
with	13
pap,	13
for	13
by	13
God	13
I	13
am	13
no	13
fool.	13
It	13
is	13
a	13
good	13
joke	13
for	13
your	13
worship	13
to	13
try	13
and	13
persuade	13
me	13
that	13
everything	13
these	13
good	13
books	13
say	13
is	13
nonsense	13
and	13
lies,	13
and	13
they	13
printed	13
by	13
the	13
license	13
of	13
the	13
Lords	13
of	13
the	13
Royal	13
Council,	13
as	13
if	13
they	13
were	13
people	13
who	13
would	13
allow	13
such	13
a	13
lot	13
of	13
lies	13
to	13
be	13
printed	13
all	13
together,	13
and	13
so	13
many	13
battles	13
and	13
enchantments	13
that	13
they	13
take	13
away	13
one’s	13
senses.”	13
“I	13
have	13
told	13
you,	13
friend,”	13
said	13
the	13
curate,	13
“that	13
this	13
is	13
done	13
to	13
divert	13
our	13
idle	13
thoughts;	13
and	13
as	13
in	13
well-ordered	13
states	13
games	13
of	13
chess,	13
fives,	13
and	13
billiards	13
are	13
allowed	13
for	13
the	13
diversion	13
of	13
those	13
who	13
do	13
not	13
care,	13
or	13
are	13
not	13
obliged,	13
or	13
are	13
unable	13
to	13
work,	13
so	13
books	13
of	13
this	13
kind	13
are	13
allowed	13
to	13
be	13
printed,	13
on	13
the	13
supposition	13
that,	13
what	13
indeed	13
is	13
the	13
truth,	13
there	13
can	13
be	13
nobody	13
so	13
ignorant	13
as	13
to	13
take	13
any	13
of	13
them	13
for	13
true	13
stories;	13
and	13
if	13
it	13
were	13
permitted	13
me	13
now,	13
and	13
the	13
present	13
company	13
desired	13
it,	13
I	13
could	13
say	13
something	13
about	13
the	13
qualities	13
books	13
of	13
chivalry	13
should	13
possess	13
to	13
be	13
good	13
ones,	13
that	13
would	13
be	13
to	13
the	13
advantage	13
and	13
even	13
to	13
the	13
taste	13
of	13
some;	13
but	13
I	13
hope	13
the	13
time	13
will	13
come	13
when	13
I	13
can	13
communicate	13
my	13
ideas	13
to	13
someone	13
who	13
may	13
be	13
able	13
to	13
mend	13
matters;	13
and	13
in	13
the	13
meantime,	13
señor	13
landlord,	13
believe	13
what	13
I	13
have	13
said,	13
and	13
take	13
your	13
books,	13
and	13
make	13
up	13
your	13
mind	13
about	13
their	13
truth	13
or	13
falsehood,	13
and	13
much	13
good	13
may	13
they	13
do	13
you;	13
and	13
God	13
grant	13
you	13
may	13
not	13
fall	13
lame	13
of	13
the	13
same	13
foot	13
your	13
guest	13
Don	13
Quixote	13
halts	13
on.”	13
“No	13
fear	13
of	13
that,”	13
returned	13
the	13
landlord;	13
“I	13
shall	13
not	13
be	13
so	13
mad	13
as	13
to	13
make	13
a	13
knight-errant	13
of	13
myself;	13
for	13
I	13
see	13
well	13
enough	13
that	13
things	13
are	13
not	13
now	13
as	13
they	13
used	13
to	13
be	13
in	13
those	13
days,	13
when	13
they	13
say	13
those	13
famous	13
knights	13
roamed	13
about	13
the	13
world.”	13
Sancho	13
had	13
made	13
his	13
appearance	13
in	13
the	13
middle	13
of	13
this	13
conversation,	13
and	13
he	13
was	13
very	13
much	13
troubled	13
and	13
cast	13
down	13
by	13
what	13
he	13
heard	13
said	13
about	13
knights-errant	13
being	13
now	13
no	13
longer	13
in	13
vogue,	13
and	13
all	13
books	13
of	13
chivalry	13
being	13
folly	13
and	13
lies;	13
and	13
he	13
resolved	13
in	13
his	13
heart	13
to	13
wait	13
and	13
see	13
what	13
came	13
of	13
this	13
journey	13
of	13
his	13
master’s,	13
and	13
if	13
it	13
did	13
not	13
turn	13
out	13
as	13
happily	13
as	13
his	13
master	13
expected,	13
he	13
determined	13
to	13
leave	13
him	13
and	13
go	13
back	13
to	13
his	13
wife	13
and	13
children	13
and	13
his	13
ordinary	13
labour.	13
The	13
landlord	13
was	13
carrying	13
away	13
the	13
valise	13
and	13
the	13
books,	13
but	13
the	13
curate	13
said	13
to	13
him,	13
“Wait;	13
I	13
want	13
to	13
see	13
what	13
those	13
papers	13
are	13
that	13
are	13
written	13
in	13
such	13
a	13
good	13
hand.”	13
The	13
landlord	13
taking	13
them	13
out	13
handed	13
them	13
to	13
him	13
to	13
read,	13
and	13
he	13
perceived	13
they	13
were	13
a	13
work	13
of	13
about	13
eight	13
sheets	13
of	13
manuscript,	13
with,	13
in	13
large	13
letters	13
at	13
the	13
beginning,	13
the	13
title	13
of	13
“Novel	13
of	13
the	13
Ill-advised	13
Curiosity.”	13
The	13
curate	13
read	13
three	13
or	13
four	13
lines	13
to	13
himself,	13
and	13
said,	13
“I	13
must	13
say	13
the	13
title	13
of	13
this	13
novel	13
does	13
not	13
seem	13
to	13
me	13
a	13
bad	13
one,	13
and	13
I	13
feel	13
an	13
inclination	13
to	13
read	13
it	13
all.”	13
To	13
which	13
the	13
landlord	13
replied,	13
“Then	13
your	13
reverence	13
will	13
do	13
well	13
to	13
read	13
it,	13
for	13
I	13
can	13
tell	13
you	13
that	13
some	13
guests	13
who	13
have	13
read	13
it	13
here	13
have	13
been	13
much	13
pleased	13
with	13
it,	13
and	13
have	13
begged	13
it	13
of	13
me	13
very	13
earnestly;	13
but	13
I	13
would	13
not	13
give	13
it,	13
meaning	13
to	13
return	13
it	13
to	13
the	13
person	13
who	13
forgot	13
the	13
valise,	13
books,	13
and	13
papers	13
here,	13
for	13
maybe	13
he	13
will	13
return	13
here	13
some	13
time	13
or	13
other;	13
and	13
though	13
I	13
know	13
I	13
shall	13
miss	13
the	13
books,	13
faith	13
I	13
mean	13
to	13
return	13
them;	13
for	13
though	13
I	13
am	13
an	13
innkeeper,	13
still	13
I	13
am	13
a	13
Christian.”	13
“You	13
are	13
very	13
right,	13
friend,”	13
said	13
the	13
curate;	13
“but	13
for	13
all	13
that,	13
if	13
the	13
novel	13
pleases	13
me	13
you	13
must	13
let	13
me	13
copy	13
it.”	13
“With	13
all	13
my	13
heart,”	13
replied	13
the	13
host.	13
While	13
they	13
were	13
talking	13
Cardenio	13
had	13
taken	13
up	13
the	13
novel	13
and	13
begun	13
to	13
read	13
it,	13
and	13
forming	13
the	13
same	13
opinion	13
of	13
it	13
as	13
the	13
curate,	13
he	13
begged	13
him	13
to	13
read	13
it	13
so	13
that	13
they	13
might	13
all	13
hear	13
it.	13
“I	13
would	13
read	13
it,”	13
said	13
the	13
curate,	13
“if	13
the	13
time	13
would	13
not	13
be	13
better	13
spent	13
in	13
sleeping.”	13
“It	13
will	13
be	13
rest	13
enough	13
for	13
me,”	13
said	13
Dorothea,	13
“to	13
while	13
away	13
the	13
time	13
by	13
listening	13
to	13
some	13
tale,	13
for	13
my	13
spirits	13
are	13
not	13
yet	13
tranquil	13
enough	13
to	13
let	13
me	13
sleep	13
when	13
it	13
would	13
be	13
seasonable.”	13
“Well	13
then,	13
in	13
that	13
case,”	13
said	13
the	13
curate,	13
“I	13
will	13
read	13
it,	13
if	13
it	13
were	13
only	13
out	13
of	13
curiosity;	13
perhaps	13
it	13
may	13
contain	13
something	13
pleasant.”	13
Master	13
Nicholas	13
added	13
his	13
entreaties	13
to	13
the	13
same	13
effect,	13
and	13
Sancho	13
too;	13
seeing	13
which,	13
and	13
considering	13
that	13
he	13
would	13
give	13
pleasure	13
to	13
all,	13
and	13
receive	13
it	13
himself,	13
the	13
curate	13
said,	13
“Well	13
then,	13
attend	13
to	13
me	13
everyone,	13
for	13
the	13
novel	13
begins	13
thus.”	13

CHAPTER	13
XXXIII.	13
IN	13
WHICH	13
IS	13
RELATED	13
THE	13
NOVEL	13
OF	13
“THE	13
ILL-ADVISED	13
CURIOSITY”	13
In	13
Florence,	13
a	13
rich	13
and	13
famous	13
city	13
of	13
Italy	13
in	13
the	13
province	13
called	13
Tuscany,	13
there	13
lived	13
two	13
gentlemen	13
of	13
wealth	13
and	13
quality,	13
Anselmo	13
and	13
Lothario,	13
such	13
great	13
friends	13
that	13
by	13
way	13
of	13
distinction	13
they	13
were	13
called	13
by	13
all	13
that	13
knew	13
them	13
“The	13
Two	13
Friends.”	13
They	13
were	13
unmarried,	13
young,	13
of	13
the	13
same	13
age	13
and	13
of	13
the	13
same	13
tastes,	13
which	13
was	13
enough	13
to	13
account	13
for	13
the	13
reciprocal	13
friendship	13
between	13
them.	13
Anselmo,	13
it	13
is	13
true,	13
was	13
somewhat	13
more	13
inclined	13
to	13
seek	13
pleasure	13
in	13
love	13
than	13
Lothario,	13
for	13
whom	13
the	13
pleasures	13
of	13
the	13
chase	13
had	13
more	13
attraction;	13
but	13
on	13
occasion	13
Anselmo	13
would	13
forego	13
his	13
own	13
tastes	13
to	13
yield	13
to	13
those	13
of	13
Lothario,	13
and	13
Lothario	13
would	13
surrender	13
his	13
to	13
fall	13
in	13
with	13
those	13
of	13
Anselmo,	13
and	13
in	13
this	13
way	13
their	13
inclinations	13
kept	13
pace	13
one	13
with	13
the	13
other	13
with	13
a	13
concord	13
so	13
perfect	13
that	13
the	13
best	13
regulated	13
clock	13
could	13
not	13
surpass	13
it.	13
Anselmo	13
was	13
deep	13
in	13
love	13
with	13
a	13
high-born	13
and	13
beautiful	13
maiden	13
of	13
the	13
same	13
city,	13
the	13
daughter	13
of	13
parents	13
so	13
estimable,	13
and	13
so	13
estimable	13
herself,	13
that	13
he	13
resolved,	13
with	13
the	13
approval	13
of	13
his	13
friend	13
Lothario,	13
without	13
whom	13
he	13
did	13
nothing,	13
to	13
ask	13
her	13
of	13
them	13
in	13
marriage,	13
and	13
did	13
so,	13
Lothario	13
being	13
the	13
bearer	13
of	13
the	13
demand,	13
and	13
conducting	13
the	13
negotiation	13
so	13
much	13
to	13
the	13
satisfaction	13
of	13
his	13
friend	13
that	13
in	13
a	13
short	13
time	13
he	13
was	13
in	13
possession	13
of	13
the	13
object	13
of	13
his	13
desires,	13
and	13
Camilla	13
so	13
happy	13
in	13
having	13
won	13
Anselmo	13
for	13
her	13
husband,	13
that	13
she	13
gave	13
thanks	13
unceasingly	13
to	13
heaven	13
and	13
to	13
Lothario,	13
by	13
whose	13
means	13
such	13
good	13
fortune	13
had	13
fallen	13
to	13
her.	13
The	13
first	13
few	13
days,	13
those	13
of	13
a	13
wedding	13
being	13
usually	13
days	13
of	13
merry-making,	13
Lothario	13
frequented	13
his	13
friend	13
Anselmo’s	13
house	13
as	13
he	13
had	13
been	13
wont,	13
striving	13
to	13
do	13
honour	13
to	13
him	13
and	13
to	13
the	13
occasion,	13
and	13
to	13
gratify	13
him	13
in	13
every	13
way	13
he	13
could;	13
but	13
when	13
the	13
wedding	13
days	13
were	13
over	13
and	13
the	13
succession	13
of	13
visits	13
and	13
congratulations	13
had	13
slackened,	13
he	13
began	13
purposely	13
to	13
leave	13
off	13
going	13
to	13
the	13
house	13
of	13
Anselmo,	13
for	13
it	13
seemed	13
to	13
him,	13
as	13
it	13
naturally	13
would	13
to	13
all	13
men	13
of	13
sense,	13
that	13
friends’	13
houses	13
ought	13
not	13
to	13
be	13
visited	13
after	13
marriage	13
with	13
the	13
same	13
frequency	13
as	13
in	13
their	13
masters’	13
bachelor	13
days:	13
because,	13
though	13
true	13
and	13
genuine	13
friendship	13
cannot	13
and	13
should	13
not	13
be	13
in	13
any	13
way	13
suspicious,	13
still	13
a	13
married	13
man’s	13
honour	13
is	13
a	13
thing	13
of	13
such	13
delicacy	13
that	13
it	13
is	13
held	13
liable	13
to	13
injury	13
from	13
brothers,	13
much	13
more	13
from	13
friends.	13
Anselmo	13
remarked	13
the	13
cessation	13
of	13
Lothario’s	13
visits,	13
and	13
complained	13
of	13
it	13
to	13
him,	13
saying	13
that	13
if	13
he	13
had	13
known	13
that	13
marriage	13
was	13
to	13
keep	13
him	13
from	13
enjoying	13
his	13
society	13
as	13
he	13
used,	13
he	13
would	13
have	13
never	13
married;	13
and	13
that,	13
if	13
by	13
the	13
thorough	13
harmony	13
that	13
subsisted	13
between	13
them	13
while	13
he	13
was	13
a	13
bachelor	13
they	13
had	13
earned	13
such	13
a	13
sweet	13
name	13
as	13
that	13
of	13
“The	13
Two	13
Friends,”	13
he	13
should	13
not	13
allow	13
a	13
title	13
so	13
rare	13
and	13
so	13
delightful	13
to	13
be	13
lost	13
through	13
a	13
needless	13
anxiety	13
to	13
act	13
circumspectly;	13
and	13
so	13
he	13
entreated	13
him,	13
if	13
such	13
a	13
phrase	13
was	13
allowable	13
between	13
them,	13
to	13
be	13
once	13
more	13
master	13
of	13
his	13
house	13
and	13
to	13
come	13
in	13
and	13
go	13
out	13
as	13
formerly,	13
assuring	13
him	13
that	13
his	13
wife	13
Camilla	13
had	13
no	13
other	13
desire	13
or	13
inclination	13
than	13
that	13
which	13
he	13
would	13
wish	13
her	13
to	13
have,	13
and	13
that	13
knowing	13
how	13
sincerely	13
they	13
loved	13
one	13
another	13
she	13
was	13
grieved	13
to	13
see	13
such	13
coldness	13
in	13
him.	13
To	13
all	13
this	13
and	13
much	13
more	13
that	13
Anselmo	13
said	13
to	13
Lothario	13
to	13
persuade	13
him	13
to	13
come	13
to	13
his	13
house	13
as	13
he	13
had	13
been	13
in	13
the	13
habit	13
of	13
doing,	13
Lothario	13
replied	13
with	13
so	13
much	13
prudence,	13
sense,	13
and	13
judgment,	13
that	13
Anselmo	13
was	13
satisfied	13
of	13
his	13
friend’s	13
good	13
intentions,	13
and	13
it	13
was	13
agreed	13
that	13
on	13
two	13
days	13
in	13
the	13
week,	13
and	13
on	13
holidays,	13
Lothario	13
should	13
come	13
to	13
dine	13
with	13
him;	13
but	13
though	13
this	13
arrangement	13
was	13
made	13
between	13
them	13
Lothario	13
resolved	13
to	13
observe	13
it	13
no	13
further	13
than	13
he	13
considered	13
to	13
be	13
in	13
accordance	13
with	13
the	13
honour	13
of	13
his	13
friend,	13
whose	13
good	13
name	13
was	13
more	13
to	13
him	13
than	13
his	13
own.	13
He	13
said,	13
and	13
justly,	13
that	13
a	13
married	13
man	13
upon	13
whom	13
heaven	13
had	13
bestowed	13
a	13
beautiful	13
wife	13
should	13
consider	13
as	13
carefully	13
what	13
friends	13
he	13
brought	13
to	13
his	13
house	13
as	13
what	13
female	13
friends	13
his	13
wife	13
associated	13
with,	13
for	13
what	13
cannot	13
be	13
done	13
or	13
arranged	13
in	13
the	13
market-place,	13
in	13
church,	13
at	13
public	13
festivals	13
or	13
at	13
stations	13
(opportunities	13
that	13
husbands	13
cannot	13
always	13
deny	13
their	13
wives),	13
may	13
be	13
easily	13
managed	13
in	13
the	13
house	13
of	13
the	13
female	13
friend	13
or	13
relative	13
in	13
whom	13
most	13
confidence	13
is	13
reposed.	13
Lothario	13
said,	13
too,	13
that	13
every	13
married	13
man	13
should	13
have	13
some	13
friend	13
who	13
would	13
point	13
out	13
to	13
him	13
any	13
negligence	13
he	13
might	13
be	13
guilty	13
of	13
in	13
his	13
conduct,	13
for	13
it	13
will	13
sometimes	13
happen	13
that	13
owing	13
to	13
the	13
deep	13
affection	13
the	13
husband	13
bears	13
his	13
wife	13
either	13
he	13
does	13
not	13
caution	13
her,	13
or,	13
not	13
to	13
vex	13
her,	13
refrains	13
from	13
telling	13
her	13
to	13
do	13
or	13
not	13
to	13
do	13
certain	13
things,	13
doing	13
or	13
avoiding	13
which	13
may	13
be	13
a	13
matter	13
of	13
honour	13
or	13
reproach	13
to	13
him;	13
and	13
errors	13
of	13
this	13
kind	13
he	13
could	13
easily	13
correct	13
if	13
warned	13
by	13
a	13
friend.	13
But	13
where	13
is	13
such	13
a	13
friend	13
to	13
be	13
found	13
as	13
Lothario	13
would	13
have,	13
so	13
judicious,	13
so	13
loyal,	13
and	13
so	13
true?	13
Of	13
a	13
truth	13
I	13
know	13
not;	13
Lothario	13
alone	13
was	13
such	13
a	13
one,	13
for	13
with	13
the	13
utmost	13
care	13
and	13
vigilance	13
he	13
watched	13
over	13
the	13
honour	13
of	13
his	13
friend,	13
and	13
strove	13
to	13
diminish,	13
cut	13
down,	13
and	13
reduce	13
the	13
number	13
of	13
days	13
for	13
going	13
to	13
his	13
house	13
according	13
to	13
their	13
agreement,	13
lest	13
the	13
visits	13
of	13
a	13
young	13
man,	13
wealthy,	13
high-born,	13
and	13
with	13
the	13
attractions	13
he	13
was	13
conscious	13
of	13
possessing,	13
at	13
the	13
house	13
of	13
a	13
woman	13
so	13
beautiful	13
as	13
Camilla,	13
should	13
be	13
regarded	13
with	13
suspicion	13
by	13
the	13
inquisitive	13
and	13
malicious	13
eyes	13
of	13
the	13
idle	13
public.	13
For	13
though	13
his	13
integrity	13
and	13
reputation	13
might	13
bridle	13
slanderous	13
tongues,	13
still	13
he	13
was	13
unwilling	13
to	13
hazard	13
either	13
his	13
own	13
good	13
name	13
or	13
that	13
of	13
his	13
friend;	13
and	13
for	13
this	13
reason	13
most	13
of	13
the	13
days	13
agreed	13
upon	13
he	13
devoted	13
to	13
some	13
other	13
business	13
which	13
he	13
pretended	13
was	13
unavoidable;	13
so	13
that	13
a	13
great	13
portion	13
of	13
the	13
day	13
was	13
taken	13
up	13
with	13
complaints	13
on	13
one	13
side	13
and	13
excuses	13
on	13
the	13
other.	13
It	13
happened,	13
however,	13
that	13
on	13
one	13
occasion	13
when	13
the	13
two	13
were	13
strolling	13
together	13
outside	13
the	13
city,	13
Anselmo	13
addressed	13
the	13
following	13
words	13
to	13
Lothario.	13
“Thou	13
mayest	13
suppose,	13
Lothario	13
my	13
friend,	13
that	13
I	13
am	13
unable	13
to	13
give	13
sufficient	13
thanks	13
for	13
the	13
favours	13
God	13
has	13
rendered	13
me	13
in	13
making	13
me	13
the	13
son	13
of	13
such	13
parents	13
as	13
mine	13
were,	13
and	13
bestowing	13
upon	13
me	13
with	13
no	13
niggard	13
hand	13
what	13
are	13
called	13
the	13
gifts	13
of	13
nature	13
as	13
well	13
as	13
those	13
of	13
fortune,	13
and	13
above	13
all	13
for	13
what	13
he	13
has	13
done	13
in	13
giving	13
me	13
thee	13
for	13
a	13
friend	13
and	13
Camilla	13
for	13
a	13
wife—two	13
treasures	13
that	13
I	13
value,	13
if	13
not	13
as	13
highly	13
as	13
I	13
ought,	13
at	13
least	13
as	13
highly	13
as	13
I	13
am	13
able.	13
And	13
yet,	13
with	13
all	13
these	13
good	13
things,	13
which	13
are	13
commonly	13
all	13
that	13
men	13
need	13
to	13
enable	13
them	13
to	13
live	13
happily,	13
I	13
am	13
the	13
most	13
discontented	13
and	13
dissatisfied	13
man	13
in	13
the	13
whole	13
world;	13
for,	13
I	13
know	13
not	13
how	13
long	13
since,	13
I	13
have	13
been	13
harassed	13
and	13
oppressed	13
by	13
a	13
desire	13
so	13
strange	13
and	13
so	13
unusual,	13
that	13
I	13
wonder	13
at	13
myself	13
and	13
blame	13
and	13
chide	13
myself	13
when	13
I	13
am	13
alone,	13
and	13
strive	13
to	13
stifle	13
it	13
and	13
hide	13
it	13
from	13
my	13
own	13
thoughts,	13
and	13
with	13
no	13
better	13
success	13
than	13
if	13
I	13
were	13
endeavouring	13
deliberately	13
to	13
publish	13
it	13
to	13
all	13
the	13
world;	13
and	13
as,	13
in	13
short,	13
it	13
must	13
come	13
out,	13
I	13
would	13
confide	13
it	13
to	13
thy	13
safe	13
keeping,	13
feeling	13
sure	13
that	13
by	13
this	13
means,	13
and	13
by	13
thy	13
readiness	13
as	13
a	13
true	13
friend	13
to	13
afford	13
me	13
relief,	13
I	13
shall	13
soon	13
find	13
myself	13
freed	13
from	13
the	13
distress	13
it	13
causes	13
me,	13
and	13
that	13
thy	13
care	13
will	13
give	13
me	13
happiness	13
in	13
the	13
same	13
degree	13
as	13
my	13
own	13
folly	13
has	13
caused	13
me	13
misery.”	13
The	13
words	13
of	13
Anselmo	13
struck	13
Lothario	13
with	13
astonishment,	13
unable	13
as	13
he	13
was	13
to	13
conjecture	13
the	13
purport	13
of	13
such	13
a	13
lengthy	13
preamble;	13
and	13
though	13
he	13
strove	13
to	13
imagine	13
what	13
desire	13
it	13
could	13
be	13
that	13
so	13
troubled	13
his	13
friend,	13
his	13
conjectures	13
were	13
all	13
far	13
from	13
the	13
truth,	13
and	13
to	13
relieve	13
the	13
anxiety	13
which	13
this	13
perplexity	13
was	13
causing	13
him,	13
he	13
told	13
him	13
he	13
was	13
doing	13
a	13
flagrant	13
injustice	13
to	13
their	13
great	13
friendship	13
in	13
seeking	13
circuitous	13
methods	13
of	13
confiding	13
to	13
him	13
his	13
most	13
hidden	13
thoughts,	13
for	13
he	13
well	13
knew	13
he	13
might	13
reckon	13
upon	13
his	13
counsel	13
in	13
diverting	13
them,	13
or	13
his	13
help	13
in	13
carrying	13
them	13
into	13
effect.	13
“That	13
is	13
the	13
truth,”	13
replied	13
Anselmo,	13
“and	13
relying	13
upon	13
that	13
I	13
will	13
tell	13
thee,	13
friend	13
Lothario,	13
that	13
the	13
desire	13
which	13
harasses	13
me	13
is	13
that	13
of	13
knowing	13
whether	13
my	13
wife	13
Camilla	13
is	13
as	13
good	13
and	13
as	13
perfect	13
as	13
I	13
think	13
her	13
to	13
be;	13
and	13
I	13
cannot	13
satisfy	13
myself	13
of	13
the	13
truth	13
on	13
this	13
point	13
except	13
by	13
testing	13
her	13
in	13
such	13
a	13
way	13
that	13
the	13
trial	13
may	13
prove	13
the	13
purity	13
of	13
her	13
virtue	13
as	13
the	13
fire	13
proves	13
that	13
of	13
gold;	13
because	13
I	13
am	13
persuaded,	13
my	13
friend,	13
that	13
a	13
woman	13
is	13
virtuous	13
only	13
in	13
proportion	13
as	13
she	13
is	13
or	13
is	13
not	13
tempted;	13
and	13
that	13
she	13
alone	13
is	13
strong	13
who	13
does	13
not	13
yield	13
to	13
the	13
promises,	13
gifts,	13
tears,	13
and	13
importunities	13
of	13
earnest	13
lovers;	13
for	13
what	13
thanks	13
does	13
a	13
woman	13
deserve	13
for	13
being	13
good	13
if	13
no	13
one	13
urges	13
her	13
to	13
be	13
bad,	13
and	13
what	13
wonder	13
is	13
it	13
that	13
she	13
is	13
reserved	13
and	13
circumspect	13
to	13
whom	13
no	13
opportunity	13
is	13
given	13
of	13
going	13
wrong	13
and	13
who	13
knows	13
she	13
has	13
a	13
husband	13
that	13
will	13
take	13
her	13
life	13
the	13
first	13
time	13
he	13
detects	13
her	13
in	13
an	13
impropriety?	13
I	13
do	13
not	13
therefore	13
hold	13
her	13
who	13
is	13
virtuous	13
through	13
fear	13
or	13
want	13
of	13
opportunity	13
in	13
the	13
same	13
estimation	13
as	13
her	13
who	13
comes	13
out	13
of	13
temptation	13
and	13
trial	13
with	13
a	13
crown	13
of	13
victory;	13
and	13
so,	13
for	13
these	13
reasons	13
and	13
many	13
others	13
that	13
I	13
could	13
give	13
thee	13
to	13
justify	13
and	13
support	13
the	13
opinion	13
I	13
hold,	13
I	13
am	13
desirous	13
that	13
my	13
wife	13
Camilla	13
should	13
pass	13
this	13
crisis,	13
and	13
be	13
refined	13
and	13
tested	13
by	13
the	13
fire	13
of	13
finding	13
herself	13
wooed	13
and	13
by	13
one	13
worthy	13
to	13
set	13
his	13
affections	13
upon	13
her;	13
and	13
if	13
she	13
comes	13
out,	13
as	13
I	13
know	13
she	13
will,	13
victorious	13
from	13
this	13
struggle,	13
I	13
shall	13
look	13
upon	13
my	13
good	13
fortune	13
as	13
unequalled,	13
I	13
shall	13
be	13
able	13
to	13
say	13
that	13
the	13
cup	13
of	13
my	13
desire	13
is	13
full,	13
and	13
that	13
the	13
virtuous	13
woman	13
of	13
whom	13
the	13
sage	13
says	13
‘Who	13
shall	13
find	13
her?’	13
has	13
fallen	13
to	13
my	13
lot.	13
And	13
if	13
the	13
result	13
be	13
the	13
contrary	13
of	13
what	13
I	13
expect,	13
in	13
the	13
satisfaction	13
of	13
knowing	13
that	13
I	13
have	13
been	13
right	13
in	13
my	13
opinion,	13
I	13
shall	13
bear	13
without	13
complaint	13
the	13
pain	13
which	13
my	13
so	13
dearly	13
bought	13
experience	13
will	13
naturally	13
cause	13
me.	13
And,	13
as	13
nothing	13
of	13
all	13
thou	13
wilt	13
urge	13
in	13
opposition	13
to	13
my	13
wish	13
will	13
avail	13
to	13
keep	13
me	13
from	13
carrying	13
it	13
into	13
effect,	13
it	13
is	13
my	13
desire,	13
friend	13
Lothario,	13
that	13
thou	13
shouldst	13
consent	13
to	13
become	13
the	13
instrument	13
for	13
effecting	13
this	13
purpose	13
that	13
I	13
am	13
bent	13
upon,	13
for	13
I	13
will	13
afford	13
thee	13
opportunities	13
to	13
that	13
end,	13
and	13
nothing	13
shall	13
be	13
wanting	13
that	13
I	13
may	13
think	13
necessary	13
for	13
the	13
pursuit	13
of	13
a	13
virtuous,	13
honourable,	13
modest	13
and	13
high-minded	13
woman.	13
And	13
among	13
other	13
reasons,	13
I	13
am	13
induced	13
to	13
entrust	13
this	13
arduous	13
task	13
to	13
thee	13
by	13
the	13
consideration	13
that	13
if	13
Camilla	13
be	13
conquered	13
by	13
thee	13
the	13
conquest	13
will	13
not	13
be	13
pushed	13
to	13
extremes,	13
but	13
only	13
far	13
enough	13
to	13
account	13
that	13
accomplished	13
which	13
from	13
a	13
sense	13
of	13
honour	13
will	13
be	13
left	13
undone;	13
thus	13
I	13
shall	13
not	13
be	13
wronged	13
in	13
anything	13
more	13
than	13
intention,	13
and	13
my	13
wrong	13
will	13
remain	13
buried	13
in	13
the	13
integrity	13
of	13
thy	13
silence,	13
which	13
I	13
know	13
well	13
will	13
be	13
as	13
lasting	13
as	13
that	13
of	13
death	13
in	13
what	13
concerns	13
me.	13
If,	13
therefore,	13
thou	13
wouldst	13
have	13
me	13
enjoy	13
what	13
can	13
be	13
called	13
life,	13
thou	13
wilt	13
at	13
once	13
engage	13
in	13
this	13
love	13
struggle,	13
not	13
lukewarmly	13
nor	13
slothfully,	13
but	13
with	13
the	13
energy	13
and	13
zeal	13
that	13
my	13
desire	13
demands,	13
and	13
with	13
the	13
loyalty	13
our	13
friendship	13
assures	13
me	13
of.”	13
Such	13
were	13
the	13
words	13
Anselmo	13
addressed	13
to	13
Lothario,	13
who	13
listened	13
to	13
them	13
with	13
such	13
attention	13
that,	13
except	13
to	13
say	13
what	13
has	13
been	13
already	13
mentioned,	13
he	13
did	13
not	13
open	13
his	13
lips	13
until	13
the	13
other	13
had	13
finished.	13
Then	13
perceiving	13
that	13
he	13
had	13
no	13
more	13
to	13
say,	13
after	13
regarding	13
him	13
for	13
a	13
while,	13
as	13
one	13
would	13
regard	13
something	13
never	13
before	13
seen	13
that	13
excited	13
wonder	13
and	13
amazement,	13
he	13
said	13
to	13
him,	13
“I	13
cannot	13
persuade	13
myself,	13
Anselmo	13
my	13
friend,	13
that	13
what	13
thou	13
hast	13
said	13
to	13
me	13
is	13
not	13
in	13
jest;	13
if	13
I	13
thought	13
that	13
thou	13
wert	13
speaking	13
seriously	13
I	13
would	13
not	13
have	13
allowed	13
thee	13
to	13
go	13
so	13
far;	13
so	13
as	13
to	13
put	13
a	13
stop	13
to	13
thy	13
long	13
harangue	13
by	13
not	13
listening	13
to	13
thee	13
I	13
verily	13
suspect	13
that	13
either	13
thou	13
dost	13
not	13
know	13
me,	13
or	13
I	13
do	13
not	13
know	13
thee;	13
but	13
no,	13
I	13
know	13
well	13
thou	13
art	13
Anselmo,	13
and	13
thou	13
knowest	13
that	13
I	13
am	13
Lothario;	13
the	13
misfortune	13
is,	13
it	13
seems	13
to	13
me,	13
that	13
thou	13
art	13
not	13
the	13
Anselmo	13
thou	13
wert,	13
and	13
must	13
have	13
thought	13
that	13
I	13
am	13
not	13
the	13
Lothario	13
I	13
should	13
be;	13
for	13
the	13
things	13
that	13
thou	13
hast	13
said	13
to	13
me	13
are	13
not	13
those	13
of	13
that	13
Anselmo	13
who	13
was	13
my	13
friend,	13
nor	13
are	13
those	13
that	13
thou	13
demandest	13
of	13
me	13
what	13
should	13
be	13
asked	13
of	13
the	13
Lothario	13
thou	13
knowest.	13
True	13
friends	13
will	13
prove	13
their	13
friends	13
and	13
make	13
use	13
of	13
them,	13
as	13
a	13
poet	13
has	13
said,	13
_usque	13
ad	13
aras;_	13
whereby	13
he	13
meant	13
that	13
they	13
will	13
not	13
make	13
use	13
of	13
their	13
friendship	13
in	13
things	13
that	13
are	13
contrary	13
to	13
God’s	13
will.	13
If	13
this,	13
then,	13
was	13
a	13
heathen’s	13
feeling	13
about	13
friendship,	13
how	13
much	13
more	13
should	13
it	13
be	13
a	13
Christian’s,	13
who	13
knows	13
that	13
the	13
divine	13
must	13
not	13
be	13
forfeited	13
for	13
the	13
sake	13
of	13
any	13
human	13
friendship?	13
And	13
if	13
a	13
friend	13
should	13
go	13
so	13
far	13
as	13
to	13
put	13
aside	13
his	13
duty	13
to	13
Heaven	13
to	13
fulfil	13
his	13
duty	13
to	13
his	13
friend,	13
it	13
should	13
not	13
be	13
in	13
matters	13
that	13
are	13
trifling	13
or	13
of	13
little	13
moment,	13
but	13
in	13
such	13
as	13
affect	13
the	13
friend’s	13
life	13
and	13
honour.	13
Now	13
tell	13
me,	13
Anselmo,	13
in	13
which	13
of	13
these	13
two	13
art	13
thou	13
imperilled,	13
that	13
I	13
should	13
hazard	13
myself	13
to	13
gratify	13
thee,	13
and	13
do	13
a	13
thing	13
so	13
detestable	13
as	13
that	13
thou	13
seekest	13
of	13
me?	13
Neither	13
forsooth;	13
on	13
the	13
contrary,	13
thou	13
dost	13
ask	13
of	13
me,	13
so	13
far	13
as	13
I	13
understand,	13
to	13
strive	13
and	13
labour	13
to	13
rob	13
thee	13
of	13
honour	13
and	13
life,	13
and	13
to	13
rob	13
myself	13
of	13
them	13
at	13
the	13
same	13
time;	13
for	13
if	13
I	13
take	13
away	13
thy	13
honour	13
it	13
is	13
plain	13
I	13
take	13
away	13
thy	13
life,	13
as	13
a	13
man	13
without	13
honour	13
is	13
worse	13
than	13
dead;	13
and	13
being	13
the	13
instrument,	13
as	13
thou	13
wilt	13
have	13
it	13
so,	13
of	13
so	13
much	13
wrong	13
to	13
thee,	13
shall	13
not	13
I,	13
too,	13
be	13
left	13
without	13
honour,	13
and	13
consequently	13
without	13
life?	13
Listen	13
to	13
me,	13
Anselmo	13
my	13
friend,	13
and	13
be	13
not	13
impatient	13
to	13
answer	13
me	13
until	13
I	13
have	13
said	13
what	13
occurs	13
to	13
me	13
touching	13
the	13
object	13
of	13
thy	13
desire,	13
for	13
there	13
will	13
be	13
time	13
enough	13
left	13
for	13
thee	13
to	13
reply	13
and	13
for	13
me	13
to	13
hear.”	13
“Be	13
it	13
so,”	13
said	13
Anselmo,	13
“say	13
what	13
thou	13
wilt.”	13
Lothario	13
then	13
went	13
on	13
to	13
say,	13
“It	13
seems	13
to	13
me,	13
Anselmo,	13
that	13
thine	13
is	13
just	13
now	13
the	13
temper	13
of	13
mind	13
which	13
is	13
always	13
that	13
of	13
the	13
Moors,	13
who	13
can	13
never	13
be	13
brought	13
to	13
see	13
the	13
error	13
of	13
their	13
creed	13
by	13
quotations	13
from	13
the	13
Holy	13
Scriptures,	13
or	13
by	13
reasons	13
which	13
depend	13
upon	13
the	13
examination	13
of	13
the	13
understanding	13
or	13
are	13
founded	13
upon	13
the	13
articles	13
of	13
faith,	13
but	13
must	13
have	13
examples	13
that	13
are	13
palpable,	13
easy,	13
intelligible,	13
capable	13
of	13
proof,	13
not	13
admitting	13
of	13
doubt,	13
with	13
mathematical	13
demonstrations	13
that	13
cannot	13
be	13
denied,	13
like,	13
‘_If	13
equals	13
be	13
taken	13
from	13
equals,	13
the	13
remainders	13
are	13
equal:_’	13
and	13
if	13
they	13
do	13
not	13
understand	13
this	13
in	13
words,	13
and	13
indeed	13
they	13
do	13
not,	13
it	13
has	13
to	13
be	13
shown	13
to	13
them	13
with	13
the	13
hands,	13
and	13
put	13
before	13
their	13
eyes,	13
and	13
even	13
with	13
all	13
this	13
no	13
one	13
succeeds	13
in	13
convincing	13
them	13
of	13
the	13
truth	13
of	13
our	13
holy	13
religion.	13
This	13
same	13
mode	13
of	13
proceeding	13
I	13
shall	13
have	13
to	13
adopt	13
with	13
thee,	13
for	13
the	13
desire	13
which	13
has	13
sprung	13
up	13
in	13
thee	13
is	13
so	13
absurd	13
and	13
remote	13
from	13
everything	13
that	13
has	13
a	13
semblance	13
of	13
reason,	13
that	13
I	13
feel	13
it	13
would	13
be	13
a	13
waste	13
of	13
time	13
to	13
employ	13
it	13
in	13
reasoning	13
with	13
thy	13
simplicity,	13
for	13
at	13
present	13
I	13
will	13
call	13
it	13
by	13
no	13
other	13
name;	13
and	13
I	13
am	13
even	13
tempted	13
to	13
leave	13
thee	13
in	13
thy	13
folly	13
as	13
a	13
punishment	13
for	13
thy	13
pernicious	13
desire;	13
but	13
the	13
friendship	13
I	13
bear	13
thee,	13
which	13
will	13
not	13
allow	13
me	13
to	13
desert	13
thee	13
in	13
such	13
manifest	13
danger	13
of	13
destruction,	13
keeps	13
me	13
from	13
dealing	13
so	13
harshly	13
by	13
thee.	13
And	13
that	13
thou	13
mayest	13
clearly	13
see	13
this,	13
say,	13
Anselmo,	13
hast	13
thou	13
not	13
told	13
me	13
that	13
I	13
must	13
force	13
my	13
suit	13
upon	13
a	13
modest	13
woman,	13
decoy	13
one	13
that	13
is	13
virtuous,	13
make	13
overtures	13
to	13
one	13
that	13
is	13
pure-minded,	13
pay	13
court	13
to	13
one	13
that	13
is	13
prudent?	13
Yes,	13
thou	13
hast	13
told	13
me	13
so.	13
Then,	13
if	13
thou	13
knowest	13
that	13
thou	13
hast	13
a	13
wife,	13
modest,	13
virtuous,	13
pure-minded	13
and	13
prudent,	13
what	13
is	13
it	13
that	13
thou	13
seekest?	13
And	13
if	13
thou	13
believest	13
that	13
she	13
will	13
come	13
forth	13
victorious	13
from	13
all	13
my	13
attacks—as	13
doubtless	13
she	13
would—what	13
higher	13
titles	13
than	13
those	13
she	13
possesses	13
now	13
dost	13
thou	13
think	13
thou	13
canst	13
bestow	13
upon	13
her	13
then,	13
or	13
in	13
what	13
will	13
she	13
be	13
better	13
then	13
than	13
she	13
is	13
now?	13
Either	13
thou	13
dost	13
not	13
hold	13
her	13
to	13
be	13
what	13
thou	13
sayest,	13
or	13
thou	13
knowest	13
not	13
what	13
thou	13
dost	13
demand.	13
If	13
thou	13
dost	13
not	13
hold	13
her	13
to	13
be	13
what	13
thou	13
sayest,	13
why	13
dost	13
thou	13
seek	13
to	13
prove	13
her	13
instead	13
of	13
treating	13
her	13
as	13
guilty	13
in	13
the	13
way	13
that	13
may	13
seem	13
best	13
to	13
thee?	13
but	13
if	13
she	13
be	13
as	13
virtuous	13
as	13
thou	13
believest,	13
it	13
is	13
an	13
uncalled-for	13
proceeding	13
to	13
make	13
trial	13
of	13
truth	13
itself,	13
for,	13
after	13
trial,	13
it	13
will	13
but	13
be	13
in	13
the	13
same	13
estimation	13
as	13
before.	13
Thus,	13
then,	13
it	13
is	13
conclusive	13
that	13
to	13
attempt	13
things	13
from	13
which	13
harm	13
rather	13
than	13
advantage	13
may	13
come	13
to	13
us	13
is	13
the	13
part	13
of	13
unreasoning	13
and	13
reckless	13
minds,	13
more	13
especially	13
when	13
they	13
are	13
things	13
which	13
we	13
are	13
not	13
forced	13
or	13
compelled	13
to	13
attempt,	13
and	13
which	13
show	13
from	13
afar	13
that	13
it	13
is	13
plainly	13
madness	13
to	13
attempt	13
them.	13
“Difficulties	13
are	13
attempted	13
either	13
for	13
the	13
sake	13
of	13
God	13
or	13
for	13
the	13
sake	13
of	13
the	13
world,	13
or	13
for	13
both;	13
those	13
undertaken	13
for	13
God’s	13
sake	13
are	13
those	13
which	13
the	13
saints	13
undertake	13
when	13
they	13
attempt	13
to	13
live	13
the	13
lives	13
of	13
angels	13
in	13
human	13
bodies;	13
those	13
undertaken	13
for	13
the	13
sake	13
of	13
the	13
world	13
are	13
those	13
of	13
the	13
men	13
who	13
traverse	13
such	13
a	13
vast	13
expanse	13
of	13
water,	13
such	13
a	13
variety	13
of	13
climates,	13
so	13
many	13
strange	13
countries,	13
to	13
acquire	13
what	13
are	13
called	13
the	13
blessings	13
of	13
fortune;	13
and	13
those	13
undertaken	13
for	13
the	13
sake	13
of	13
God	13
and	13
the	13
world	13
together	13
are	13
those	13
of	13
brave	13
soldiers,	13
who	13
no	13
sooner	13
do	13
they	13
see	13
in	13
the	13
enemy’s	13
wall	13
a	13
breach	13
as	13
wide	13
as	13
a	13
cannon	13
ball	13
could	13
make,	13
than,	13
casting	13
aside	13
all	13
fear,	13
without	13
hesitating,	13
or	13
heeding	13
the	13
manifest	13
peril	13
that	13
threatens	13
them,	13
borne	13
onward	13
by	13
the	13
desire	13
of	13
defending	13
their	13
faith,	13
their	13
country,	13
and	13
their	13
king,	13
they	13
fling	13
themselves	13
dauntlessly	13
into	13
the	13
midst	13
of	13
the	13
thousand	13
opposing	13
deaths	13
that	13
await	13
them.	13
Such	13
are	13
the	13
things	13
that	13
men	13
are	13
wont	13
to	13
attempt,	13
and	13
there	13
is	13
honour,	13
glory,	13
gain,	13
in	13
attempting	13
them,	13
however	13
full	13
of	13
difficulty	13
and	13
peril	13
they	13
may	13
be;	13
but	13
that	13
which	13
thou	13
sayest	13
it	13
is	13
thy	13
wish	13
to	13
attempt	13
and	13
carry	13
out	13
will	13
not	13
win	13
thee	13
the	13
glory	13
of	13
God	13
nor	13
the	13
blessings	13
of	13
fortune	13
nor	13
fame	13
among	13
men;	13
for	13
even	13
if	13
the	13
issue	13
be	13
as	13
thou	13
wouldst	13
have	13
it,	13
thou	13
wilt	13
be	13
no	13
happier,	13
richer,	13
or	13
more	13
honoured	13
than	13
thou	13
art	13
this	13
moment;	13
and	13
if	13
it	13
be	13
otherwise	13
thou	13
wilt	13
be	13
reduced	13
to	13
misery	13
greater	13
than	13
can	13
be	13
imagined,	13
for	13
then	13
it	13
will	13
avail	13
thee	13
nothing	13
to	13
reflect	13
that	13
no	13
one	13
is	13
aware	13
of	13
the	13
misfortune	13
that	13
has	13
befallen	13
thee;	13
it	13
will	13
suffice	13
to	13
torture	13
and	13
crush	13
thee	13
that	13
thou	13
knowest	13
it	13
thyself.	13
And	13
in	13
confirmation	13
of	13
the	13
truth	13
of	13
what	13
I	13
say,	13
let	13
me	13
repeat	13
to	13
thee	13
a	13
stanza	13
made	13
by	13
the	13
famous	13
poet	13
Luigi	13
Tansillo	13
at	13
the	13
end	13
of	13
the	13
first	13
part	13
of	13
his	13
‘Tears	13
of	13
Saint	13
Peter,’	13
which	13
says	13
thus:	13
The	13
anguish	13
and	13
the	13
shame	13
but	13
greater	13
grew	13
In	13
Peter’s	13
heart	13
as	13
morning	13
slowly	13
came;	13
No	13
eye	13
was	13
there	13
to	13
see	13
him,	13
well	13
he	13
knew,	13
Yet	13
he	13
himself	13
was	13
to	13
himself	13
a	13
shame;	13
Exposed	13
to	13
all	13
men’s	13
gaze,	13
or	13
screened	13
from	13
view,	13
A	13
noble	13
heart	13
will	13
feel	13
the	13
pang	13
the	13
same;	13
A	13
prey	13
to	13
shame	13
the	13
sinning	13
soul	13
will	13
be,	13
Though	13
none	13
but	13
heaven	13
and	13
earth	13
its	13
shame	13
can	13
see.	13
Thus	13
by	13
keeping	13
it	13
secret	13
thou	13
wilt	13
not	13
escape	13
thy	13
sorrow,	13
but	13
rather	13
thou	13
wilt	13
shed	13
tears	13
unceasingly,	13
if	13
not	13
tears	13
of	13
the	13
eyes,	13
tears	13
of	13
blood	13
from	13
the	13
heart,	13
like	13
those	13
shed	13
by	13
that	13
simple	13
doctor	13
our	13
poet	13
tells	13
us	13
of,	13
that	13
tried	13
the	13
test	13
of	13
the	13
cup,	13
which	13
the	13
wise	13
Rinaldo,	13
better	13
advised,	13
refused	13
to	13
do;	13
for	13
though	13
this	13
may	13
be	13
a	13
poetic	13
fiction	13
it	13
contains	13
a	13
moral	13
lesson	13
worthy	13
of	13
attention	13
and	13
study	13
and	13
imitation.	13
Moreover	13
by	13
what	13
I	13
am	13
about	13
to	13
say	13
to	13
thee	13
thou	13
wilt	13
be	13
led	13
to	13
see	13
the	13
great	13
error	13
thou	13
wouldst	13
commit.	13
“Tell	13
me,	13
Anselmo,	13
if	13
Heaven	13
or	13
good	13
fortune	13
had	13
made	13
thee	13
master	13
and	13
lawful	13
owner	13
of	13
a	13
diamond	13
of	13
the	13
finest	13
quality,	13
with	13
the	13
excellence	13
and	13
purity	13
of	13
which	13
all	13
the	13
lapidaries	13
that	13
had	13
seen	13
it	13
had	13
been	13
satisfied,	13
saying	13
with	13
one	13
voice	13
and	13
common	13
consent	13
that	13
in	13
purity,	13
quality,	13
and	13
fineness,	13
it	13
was	13
all	13
that	13
a	13
stone	13
of	13
the	13
kind	13
could	13
possibly	13
be,	13
thou	13
thyself	13
too	13
being	13
of	13
the	13
same	13
belief,	13
as	13
knowing	13
nothing	13
to	13
the	13
contrary,	13
would	13
it	13
be	13
reasonable	13
in	13
thee	13
to	13
desire	13
to	13
take	13
that	13
diamond	13
and	13
place	13
it	13
between	13
an	13
anvil	13
and	13
a	13
hammer,	13
and	13
by	13
mere	13
force	13
of	13
blows	13
and	13
strength	13
of	13
arm	13
try	13
if	13
it	13
were	13
as	13
hard	13
and	13
as	13
fine	13
as	13
they	13
said?	13
And	13
if	13
thou	13
didst,	13
and	13
if	13
the	13
stone	13
should	13
resist	13
so	13
silly	13
a	13
test,	13
that	13
would	13
add	13
nothing	13
to	13
its	13
value	13
or	13
reputation;	13
and	13
if	13
it	13
were	13
broken,	13
as	13
it	13
might	13
be,	13
would	13
not	13
all	13
be	13
lost?	13
Undoubtedly	13
it	13
would,	13
leaving	13
its	13
owner	13
to	13
be	13
rated	13
as	13
a	13
fool	13
in	13
the	13
opinion	13
of	13
all.	13
Consider,	13
then,	13
Anselmo	13
my	13
friend,	13
that	13
Camilla	13
is	13
a	13
diamond	13
of	13
the	13
finest	13
quality	13
as	13
well	13
in	13
thy	13
estimation	13
as	13
in	13
that	13
of	13
others,	13
and	13
that	13
it	13
is	13
contrary	13
to	13
reason	13
to	13
expose	13
her	13
to	13
the	13
risk	13
of	13
being	13
broken;	13
for	13
if	13
she	13
remains	13
intact	13
she	13
cannot	13
rise	13
to	13
a	13
higher	13
value	13
than	13
she	13
now	13
possesses;	13
and	13
if	13
she	13
give	13
way	13
and	13
be	13
unable	13
to	13
resist,	13
bethink	13
thee	13
now	13
how	13
thou	13
wilt	13
be	13
deprived	13
of	13
her,	13
and	13
with	13
what	13
good	13
reason	13
thou	13
wilt	13
complain	13
of	13
thyself	13
for	13
having	13
been	13
the	13
cause	13
of	13
her	13
ruin	13
and	13
thine	13
own.	13
Remember	13
there	13
is	13
no	13
jewel	13
in	13
the	13
world	13
so	13
precious	13
as	13
a	13
chaste	13
and	13
virtuous	13
woman,	13
and	13
that	13
the	13
whole	13
honour	13
of	13
women	13
consists	13
in	13
reputation;	13
and	13
since	13
thy	13
wife’s	13
is	13
of	13
that	13
high	13
excellence	13
that	13
thou	13
knowest,	13
wherefore	13
shouldst	13
thou	13
seek	13
to	13
call	13
that	13
truth	13
in	13
question?	13
Remember,	13
my	13
friend,	13
that	13
woman	13
is	13
an	13
imperfect	13
animal,	13
and	13
that	13
impediments	13
are	13
not	13
to	13
be	13
placed	13
in	13
her	13
way	13
to	13
make	13
her	13
trip	13
and	13
fall,	13
but	13
that	13
they	13
should	13
be	13
removed,	13
and	13
her	13
path	13
left	13
clear	13
of	13
all	13
obstacles,	13
so	13
that	13
without	13
hindrance	13
she	13
may	13
run	13
her	13
course	13
freely	13
to	13
attain	13
the	13
desired	13
perfection,	13
which	13
consists	13
in	13
being	13
virtuous.	13
Naturalists	13
tell	13
us	13
that	13
the	13
ermine	13
is	13
a	13
little	13
animal	13
which	13
has	13
a	13
fur	13
of	13
purest	13
white,	13
and	13
that	13
when	13
the	13
hunters	13
wish	13
to	13
take	13
it,	13
they	13
make	13
use	13
of	13
this	13
artifice.	13
Having	13
ascertained	13
the	13
places	13
which	13
it	13
frequents	13
and	13
passes,	13
they	13
stop	13
the	13
way	13
to	13
them	13
with	13
mud,	13
and	13
then	13
rousing	13
it,	13
drive	13
it	13
towards	13
the	13
spot,	13
and	13
as	13
soon	13
as	13
the	13
ermine	13
comes	13
to	13
the	13
mud	13
it	13
halts,	13
and	13
allows	13
itself	13
to	13
be	13
taken	13
captive	13
rather	13
than	13
pass	13
through	13
the	13
mire,	13
and	13
spoil	13
and	13
sully	13
its	13
whiteness,	13
which	13
it	13
values	13
more	13
than	13
life	13
and	13
liberty.	13
The	13
virtuous	13
and	13
chaste	13
woman	13
is	13
an	13
ermine,	13
and	13
whiter	13
and	13
purer	13
than	13
snow	13
is	13
the	13
virtue	13
of	13
modesty;	13
and	13
he	13
who	13
wishes	13
her	13
not	13
to	13
lose	13
it,	13
but	13
to	13
keep	13
and	13
preserve	13
it,	13
must	13
adopt	13
a	13
course	13
different	13
from	13
that	13
employed	13
with	13
the	13
ermine;	13
he	13
must	13
not	13
put	13
before	13
her	13
the	13
mire	13
of	13
the	13
gifts	13
and	13
attentions	13
of	13
persevering	13
lovers,	13
because	13
perhaps—and	13
even	13
without	13
a	13
perhaps—she	13
may	13
not	13
have	13
sufficient	13
virtue	13
and	13
natural	13
strength	13
in	13
herself	13
to	13
pass	13
through	13
and	13
tread	13
under	13
foot	13
these	13
impediments;	13
they	13
must	13
be	13
removed,	13
and	13
the	13
brightness	13
of	13
virtue	13
and	13
the	13
beauty	13
of	13
a	13
fair	13
fame	13
must	13
be	13
put	13
before	13
her.	13
A	13
virtuous	13
woman,	13
too,	13
is	13
like	13
a	13
mirror,	13
of	13
clear	13
shining	13
crystal,	13
liable	13
to	13
be	13
tarnished	13
and	13
dimmed	13
by	13
every	13
breath	13
that	13
touches	13
it.	13
She	13
must	13
be	13
treated	13
as	13
relics	13
are;	13
adored,	13
not	13
touched.	13
She	13
must	13
be	13
protected	13
and	13
prized	13
as	13
one	13
protects	13
and	13
prizes	13
a	13
fair	13
garden	13
full	13
of	13
roses	13
and	13
flowers,	13
the	13
owner	13
of	13
which	13
allows	13
no	13
one	13
to	13
trespass	13
or	13
pluck	13
a	13
blossom;	13
enough	13
for	13
others	13
that	13
from	13
afar	13
and	13
through	13
the	13
iron	13
grating	13
they	13
may	13
enjoy	13
its	13
fragrance	13
and	13
its	13
beauty.	13
Finally	13
let	13
me	13
repeat	13
to	13
thee	13
some	13
verses	13
that	13
come	13
to	13
my	13
mind;	13
I	13
heard	13
them	13
in	13
a	13
modern	13
comedy,	13
and	13
it	13
seems	13
to	13
me	13
they	13
bear	13
upon	13
the	13
point	13
we	13
are	13
discussing.	13
A	13
prudent	13
old	13
man	13
was	13
giving	13
advice	13
to	13
another,	13
the	13
father	13
of	13
a	13
young	13
girl,	13
to	13
lock	13
her	13
up,	13
watch	13
over	13
her	13
and	13
keep	13
her	13
in	13
seclusion,	13
and	13
among	13
other	13
arguments	13
he	13
used	13
these:	13
Woman	13
is	13
a	13
thing	13
of	13
glass;	13
But	13
her	13
brittleness	13
’tis	13
best	13
Not	13
too	13
curiously	13
to	13
test:	13
Who	13
knows	13
what	13
may	13
come	13
to	13
pass?	13
Breaking	13
is	13
an	13
easy	13
matter,	13
And	13
it’s	13
folly	13
to	13
expose	13
What	13
you	13
cannot	13
mend	13
to	13
blows;	13
What	13
you	13
can’t	13
make	13
whole	13
to	13
shatter.	13
This,	13
then,	13
all	13
may	13
hold	13
as	13
true,	13
And	13
the	13
reason’s	13
plain	13
to	13
see;	13
For	13
if	13
Danaës	13
there	13
be,	13
There	13
are	13
golden	13
showers	13
too.	13
“All	13
that	13
I	13
have	13
said	13
to	13
thee	13
so	13
far,	13
Anselmo,	13
has	13
had	13
reference	13
to	13
what	13
concerns	13
thee;	13
now	13
it	13
is	13
right	13
that	13
I	13
should	13
say	13
something	13
of	13
what	13
regards	13
myself;	13
and	13
if	13
I	13
be	13
prolix,	13
pardon	13
me,	13
for	13
the	13
labyrinth	13
into	13
which	13
thou	13
hast	13
entered	13
and	13
from	13
which	13
thou	13
wouldst	13
have	13
me	13
extricate	13
thee	13
makes	13
it	13
necessary.	13
“Thou	13
dost	13
reckon	13
me	13
thy	13
friend,	13
and	13
thou	13
wouldst	13
rob	13
me	13
of	13
honour,	13
a	13
thing	13
wholly	13
inconsistent	13
with	13
friendship;	13
and	13
not	13
only	13
dost	13
thou	13
aim	13
at	13
this,	13
but	13
thou	13
wouldst	13
have	13
me	13
rob	13
thee	13
of	13
it	13
also.	13
That	13
thou	13
wouldst	13
rob	13
me	13
of	13
it	13
is	13
clear,	13
for	13
when	13
Camilla	13
sees	13
that	13
I	13
pay	13
court	13
to	13
her	13
as	13
thou	13
requirest,	13
she	13
will	13
certainly	13
regard	13
me	13
as	13
a	13
man	13
without	13
honour	13
or	13
right	13
feeling,	13
since	13
I	13
attempt	13
and	13
do	13
a	13
thing	13
so	13
much	13
opposed	13
to	13
what	13
I	13
owe	13
to	13
my	13
own	13
position	13
and	13
thy	13
friendship.	13
That	13
thou	13
wouldst	13
have	13
me	13
rob	13
thee	13
of	13
it	13
is	13
beyond	13
a	13
doubt,	13
for	13
Camilla,	13
seeing	13
that	13
I	13
press	13
my	13
suit	13
upon	13
her,	13
will	13
suppose	13
that	13
I	13
have	13
perceived	13
in	13
her	13
something	13
light	13
that	13
has	13
encouraged	13
me	13
to	13
make	13
known	13
to	13
her	13
my	13
base	13
desire;	13
and	13
if	13
she	13
holds	13
herself	13
dishonoured,	13
her	13
dishonour	13
touches	13
thee	13
as	13
belonging	13
to	13
her;	13
and	13
hence	13
arises	13
what	13
so	13
commonly	13
takes	13
place,	13
that	13
the	13
husband	13
of	13
the	13
adulterous	13
woman,	13
though	13
he	13
may	13
not	13
be	13
aware	13
of	13
or	13
have	13
given	13
any	13
cause	13
for	13
his	13
wife’s	13
failure	13
in	13
her	13
duty,	13
or	13
(being	13
careless	13
or	13
negligent)	13
have	13
had	13
it	13
in	13
his	13
power	13
to	13
prevent	13
his	13
dishonour,	13
nevertheless	13
is	13
stigmatised	13
by	13
a	13
vile	13
and	13
reproachful	13
name,	13
and	13
in	13
a	13
manner	13
regarded	13
with	13
eyes	13
of	13
contempt	13
instead	13
of	13
pity	13
by	13
all	13
who	13
know	13
of	13
his	13
wife’s	13
guilt,	13
though	13
they	13
see	13
that	13
he	13
is	13
unfortunate	13
not	13
by	13
his	13
own	13
fault,	13
but	13
by	13
the	13
lust	13
of	13
a	13
vicious	13
consort.	13
But	13
I	13
will	13
tell	13
thee	13
why	13
with	13
good	13
reason	13
dishonour	13
attaches	13
to	13
the	13
husband	13
of	13
the	13
unchaste	13
wife,	13
though	13
he	13
know	13
not	13
that	13
she	13
is	13
so,	13
nor	13
be	13
to	13
blame,	13
nor	13
have	13
done	13
anything,	13
or	13
given	13
any	13
provocation	13
to	13
make	13
her	13
so;	13
and	13
be	13
not	13
weary	13
with	13
listening	13
to	13
me,	13
for	13
it	13
will	13
be	13
for	13
thy	13
good.	13
“When	13
God	13
created	13
our	13
first	13
parent	13
in	13
the	13
earthly	13
paradise,	13
the	13
Holy	13
Scripture	13
says	13
that	13
he	13
infused	13
sleep	13
into	13
Adam	13
and	13
while	13
he	13
slept	13
took	13
a	13
rib	13
from	13
his	13
left	13
side	13
of	13
which	13
he	13
formed	13
our	13
mother	13
Eve,	13
and	13
when	13
Adam	13
awoke	13
and	13
beheld	13
her	13
he	13
said,	13
‘This	13
is	13
flesh	13
of	13
my	13
flesh,	13
and	13
bone	13
of	13
my	13
bone.’	13
And	13
God	13
said	13
‘For	13
this	13
shall	13
a	13
man	13
leave	13
his	13
father	13
and	13
his	13
mother,	13
and	13
they	13
shall	13
be	13
two	13
in	13
one	13
flesh;	13
and	13
then	13
was	13
instituted	13
the	13
divine	13
sacrament	13
of	13
marriage,	13
with	13
such	13
ties	13
that	13
death	13
alone	13
can	13
loose	13
them.	13
And	13
such	13
is	13
the	13
force	13
and	13
virtue	13
of	13
this	13
miraculous	13
sacrament	13
that	13
it	13
makes	13
two	13
different	13
persons	13
one	13
and	13
the	13
same	13
flesh;	13
and	13
even	13
more	13
than	13
this	13
when	13
the	13
virtuous	13
are	13
married;	13
for	13
though	13
they	13
have	13
two	13
souls	13
they	13
have	13
but	13
one	13
will.	13
And	13
hence	13
it	13
follows	13
that	13
as	13
the	13
flesh	13
of	13
the	13
wife	13
is	13
one	13
and	13
the	13
same	13
with	13
that	13
of	13
her	13
husband	13
the	13
stains	13
that	13
may	13
come	13
upon	13
it,	13
or	13
the	13
injuries	13
it	13
incurs	13
fall	13
upon	13
the	13
husband’s	13
flesh,	13
though	13
he,	13
as	13
has	13
been	13
said,	13
may	13
have	13
given	13
no	13
cause	13
for	13
them;	13
for	13
as	13
the	13
pain	13
of	13
the	13
foot	13
or	13
any	13
member	13
of	13
the	13
body	13
is	13
felt	13
by	13
the	13
whole	13
body,	13
because	13
all	13
is	13
one	13
flesh,	13
as	13
the	13
head	13
feels	13
the	13
hurt	13
to	13
the	13
ankle	13
without	13
having	13
caused	13
it,	13
so	13
the	13
husband,	13
being	13
one	13
with	13
her,	13
shares	13
the	13
dishonour	13
of	13
the	13
wife;	13
and	13
as	13
all	13
worldly	13
honour	13
or	13
dishonour	13
comes	13
of	13
flesh	13
and	13
blood,	13
and	13
the	13
erring	13
wife’s	13
is	13
of	13
that	13
kind,	13
the	13
husband	13
must	13
needs	13
bear	13
his	13
part	13
of	13
it	13
and	13
be	13
held	13
dishonoured	13
without	13
knowing	13
it.	13
See,	13
then,	13
Anselmo,	13
the	13
peril	13
thou	13
art	13
encountering	13
in	13
seeking	13
to	13
disturb	13
the	13
peace	13
of	13
thy	13
virtuous	13
consort;	13
see	13
for	13
what	13
an	13
empty	13
and	13
ill-advised	13
curiosity	13
thou	13
wouldst	13
rouse	13
up	13
passions	13
that	13
now	13
repose	13
in	13
quiet	13
in	13
the	13
breast	13
of	13
thy	13
chaste	13
wife;	13
reflect	13
that	13
what	13
thou	13
art	13
staking	13
all	13
to	13
win	13
is	13
little,	13
and	13
what	13
thou	13
wilt	13
lose	13
so	13
much	13
that	13
I	13
leave	13
it	13
undescribed,	13
not	13
having	13
the	13
words	13
to	13
express	13
it.	13
But	13
if	13
all	13
I	13
have	13
said	13
be	13
not	13
enough	13
to	13
turn	13
thee	13
from	13
thy	13
vile	13
purpose,	13
thou	13
must	13
seek	13
some	13
other	13
instrument	13
for	13
thy	13
dishonour	13
and	13
misfortune;	13
for	13
such	13
I	13
will	13
not	13
consent	13
to	13
be,	13
though	13
I	13
lose	13
thy	13
friendship,	13
the	13
greatest	13
loss	13
that	13
I	13
can	13
conceive.”	13
Having	13
said	13
this,	13
the	13
wise	13
and	13
virtuous	13
Lothario	13
was	13
silent,	13
and	13
Anselmo,	13
troubled	13
in	13
mind	13
and	13
deep	13
in	13
thought,	13
was	13
unable	13
for	13
a	13
while	13
to	13
utter	13
a	13
word	13
in	13
reply;	13
but	13
at	13
length	13
he	13
said,	13
“I	13
have	13
listened,	13
Lothario	13
my	13
friend,	13
attentively,	13
as	13
thou	13
hast	13
seen,	13
to	13
what	13
thou	13
hast	13
chosen	13
to	13
say	13
to	13
me,	13
and	13
in	13
thy	13
arguments,	13
examples,	13
and	13
comparisons	13
I	13
have	13
seen	13
that	13
high	13
intelligence	13
thou	13
dost	13
possess,	13
and	13
the	13
perfection	13
of	13
true	13
friendship	13
thou	13
hast	13
reached;	13
and	13
likewise	13
I	13
see	13
and	13
confess	13
that	13
if	13
I	13
am	13
not	13
guided	13
by	13
thy	13
opinion,	13
but	13
follow	13
my	13
own,	13
I	13
am	13
flying	13
from	13
the	13
good	13
and	13
pursuing	13
the	13
evil.	13
This	13
being	13
so,	13
thou	13
must	13
remember	13
that	13
I	13
am	13
now	13
labouring	13
under	13
that	13
infirmity	13
which	13
women	13
sometimes	13
suffer	13
from,	13
when	13
the	13
craving	13
seizes	13
them	13
to	13
eat	13
clay,	13
plaster,	13
charcoal,	13
and	13
things	13
even	13
worse,	13
disgusting	13
to	13
look	13
at,	13
much	13
more	13
to	13
eat;	13
so	13
that	13
it	13
will	13
be	13
necessary	13
to	13
have	13
recourse	13
to	13
some	13
artifice	13
to	13
cure	13
me;	13
and	13
this	13
can	13
be	13
easily	13
effected	13
if	13
only	13
thou	13
wilt	13
make	13
a	13
beginning,	13
even	13
though	13
it	13
be	13
in	13
a	13
lukewarm	13
and	13
make-believe	13
fashion,	13
to	13
pay	13
court	13
to	13
Camilla,	13
who	13
will	13
not	13
be	13
so	13
yielding	13
that	13
her	13
virtue	13
will	13
give	13
way	13
at	13
the	13
first	13
attack:	13
with	13
this	13
mere	13
attempt	13
I	13
shall	13
rest	13
satisfied,	13
and	13
thou	13
wilt	13
have	13
done	13
what	13
our	13
friendship	13
binds	13
thee	13
to	13
do,	13
not	13
only	13
in	13
giving	13
me	13
life,	13
but	13
in	13
persuading	13
me	13
not	13
to	13
discard	13
my	13
honour.	13
And	13
this	13
thou	13
art	13
bound	13
to	13
do	13
for	13
one	13
reason	13
alone,	13
that,	13
being,	13
as	13
I	13
am,	13
resolved	13
to	13
apply	13
this	13
test,	13
it	13
is	13
not	13
for	13
thee	13
to	13
permit	13
me	13
to	13
reveal	13
my	13
weakness	13
to	13
another,	13
and	13
so	13
imperil	13
that	13
honour	13
thou	13
art	13
striving	13
to	13
keep	13
me	13
from	13
losing;	13
and	13
if	13
thine	13
may	13
not	13
stand	13
as	13
high	13
as	13
it	13
ought	13
in	13
the	13
estimation	13
of	13
Camilla	13
while	13
thou	13
art	13
paying	13
court	13
to	13
her,	13
that	13
is	13
of	13
little	13
or	13
no	13
importance,	13
because	13
ere	13
long,	13
on	13
finding	13
in	13
her	13
that	13
constancy	13
which	13
we	13
expect,	13
thou	13
canst	13
tell	13
her	13
the	13
plain	13
truth	13
as	13
regards	13
our	13
stratagem,	13
and	13
so	13
regain	13
thy	13
place	13
in	13
her	13
esteem;	13
and	13
as	13
thou	13
art	13
venturing	13
so	13
little,	13
and	13
by	13
the	13
venture	13
canst	13
afford	13
me	13
so	13
much	13
satisfaction,	13
refuse	13
not	13
to	13
undertake	13
it,	13
even	13
if	13
further	13
difficulties	13
present	13
themselves	13
to	13
thee;	13
for,	13
as	13
I	13
have	13
said,	13
if	13
thou	13
wilt	13
only	13
make	13
a	13
beginning	13
I	13
will	13
acknowledge	13
the	13
issue	13
decided.”	13
Lothario	13
seeing	13
the	13
fixed	13
determination	13
of	13
Anselmo,	13
and	13
not	13
knowing	13
what	13
further	13
examples	13
to	13
offer	13
or	13
arguments	13
to	13
urge	13
in	13
order	13
to	13
dissuade	13
him	13
from	13
it,	13
and	13
perceiving	13
that	13
he	13
threatened	13
to	13
confide	13
his	13
pernicious	13
scheme	13
to	13
someone	13
else,	13
to	13
avoid	13
a	13
greater	13
evil	13
resolved	13
to	13
gratify	13
him	13
and	13
do	13
what	13
he	13
asked,	13
intending	13
to	13
manage	13
the	13
business	13
so	13
as	13
to	13
satisfy	13
Anselmo	13
without	13
corrupting	13
the	13
mind	13
of	13
Camilla;	13
so	13
in	13
reply	13
he	13
told	13
him	13
not	13
to	13
communicate	13
his	13
purpose	13
to	13
any	13
other,	13
for	13
he	13
would	13
undertake	13
the	13
task	13
himself,	13
and	13
would	13
begin	13
it	13
as	13
soon	13
as	13
he	13
pleased.	13
Anselmo	13
embraced	13
him	13
warmly	13
and	13
affectionately,	13
and	13
thanked	13
him	13
for	13
his	13
offer	13
as	13
if	13
he	13
had	13
bestowed	13
some	13
great	13
favour	13
upon	13
him;	13
and	13
it	13
was	13
agreed	13
between	13
them	13
to	13
set	13
about	13
it	13
the	13
next	13
day,	13
Anselmo	13
affording	13
opportunity	13
and	13
time	13
to	13
Lothario	13
to	13
converse	13
alone	13
with	13
Camilla,	13
and	13
furnishing	13
him	13
with	13
money	13
and	13
jewels	13
to	13
offer	13
and	13
present	13
to	13
her.	13
He	13
suggested,	13
too,	13
that	13
he	13
should	13
treat	13
her	13
to	13
music,	13
and	13
write	13
verses	13
in	13
her	13
praise,	13
and	13
if	13
he	13
was	13
unwilling	13
to	13
take	13
the	13
trouble	13
of	13
composing	13
them,	13
he	13
offered	13
to	13
do	13
it	13
himself.	13
Lothario	13
agreed	13
to	13
all	13
with	13
an	13
intention	13
very	13
different	13
from	13
what	13
Anselmo	13
supposed,	13
and	13
with	13
this	13
understanding	13
they	13
returned	13
to	13
Anselmo’s	13
house,	13
where	13
they	13
found	13
Camilla	13
awaiting	13
her	13
husband	13
anxiously	13
and	13
uneasily,	13
for	13
he	13
was	13
later	13
than	13
usual	13
in	13
returning	13
that	13
day.	13
Lothario	13
repaired	13
to	13
his	13
own	13
house,	13
and	13
Anselmo	13
remained	13
in	13
his,	13
as	13
well	13
satisfied	13
as	13
Lothario	13
was	13
troubled	13
in	13
mind;	13
for	13
he	13
could	13
see	13
no	13
satisfactory	13
way	13
out	13
of	13
this	13
ill-advised	13
business.	13
That	13
night,	13
however,	13
he	13
thought	13
of	13
a	13
plan	13
by	13
which	13
he	13
might	13
deceive	13
Anselmo	13
without	13
any	13
injury	13
to	13
Camilla.	13
The	13
next	13
day	13
he	13
went	13
to	13
dine	13
with	13
his	13
friend,	13
and	13
was	13
welcomed	13
by	13
Camilla,	13
who	13
received	13
and	13
treated	13
him	13
with	13
great	13
cordiality,	13
knowing	13
the	13
affection	13
her	13
husband	13
felt	13
for	13
him.	13
When	13
dinner	13
was	13
over	13
and	13
the	13
cloth	13
removed,	13
Anselmo	13
told	13
Lothario	13
to	13
stay	13
there	13
with	13
Camilla	13
while	13
he	13
attended	13
to	13
some	13
pressing	13
business,	13
as	13
he	13
would	13
return	13
in	13
an	13
hour	13
and	13
a	13
half.	13
Camilla	13
begged	13
him	13
not	13
to	13
go,	13
and	13
Lothario	13
offered	13
to	13
accompany	13
him,	13
but	13
nothing	13
could	13
persuade	13
Anselmo,	13
who	13
on	13
the	13
contrary	13
pressed	13
Lothario	13
to	13
remain	13
waiting	13
for	13
him	13
as	13
he	13
had	13
a	13
matter	13
of	13
great	13
importance	13
to	13
discuss	13
with	13
him.	13
At	13
the	13
same	13
time	13
he	13
bade	13
Camilla	13
not	13
to	13
leave	13
Lothario	13
alone	13
until	13
he	13
came	13
back.	13
In	13
short	13
he	13
contrived	13
to	13
put	13
so	13
good	13
a	13
face	13
on	13
the	13
reason,	13
or	13
the	13
folly,	13
of	13
his	13
absence	13
that	13
no	13
one	13
could	13
have	13
suspected	13
it	13
was	13
a	13
pretence.	13
Anselmo	13
took	13
his	13
departure,	13
and	13
Camilla	13
and	13
Lothario	13
were	13
left	13
alone	13
at	13
the	13
table,	13
for	13
the	13
rest	13
of	13
the	13
household	13
had	13
gone	13
to	13
dinner.	13
Lothario	13
saw	13
himself	13
in	13
the	13
lists	13
according	13
to	13
his	13
friend’s	13
wish,	13
and	13
facing	13
an	13
enemy	13
that	13
could	13
by	13
her	13
beauty	13
alone	13
vanquish	13
a	13
squadron	13
of	13
armed	13
knights;	13
judge	13
whether	13
he	13
had	13
good	13
reason	13
to	13
fear;	13
but	13
what	13
he	13
did	13
was	13
to	13
lean	13
his	13
elbow	13
on	13
the	13
arm	13
of	13
the	13
chair,	13
and	13
his	13
cheek	13
upon	13
his	13
hand,	13
and,	13
asking	13
Camilla’s	13
pardon	13
for	13
his	13
ill	13
manners,	13
he	13
said	13
he	13
wished	13
to	13
take	13
a	13
little	13
sleep	13
until	13
Anselmo	13
returned.	13
Camilla	13
in	13
reply	13
said	13
he	13
could	13
repose	13
more	13
at	13
his	13
ease	13
in	13
the	13
reception-room	13
than	13
in	13
his	13
chair,	13
and	13
begged	13
of	13
him	13
to	13
go	13
in	13
and	13
sleep	13
there;	13
but	13
Lothario	13
declined,	13
and	13
there	13
he	13
remained	13
asleep	13
until	13
the	13
return	13
of	13
Anselmo,	13
who	13
finding	13
Camilla	13
in	13
her	13
own	13
room,	13
and	13
Lothario	13
asleep,	13
imagined	13
that	13
he	13
had	13
stayed	13
away	13
so	13
long	13
as	13
to	13
have	13
afforded	13
them	13
time	13
enough	13
for	13
conversation	13
and	13
even	13
for	13
sleep,	13
and	13
was	13
all	13
impatience	13
until	13
Lothario	13
should	13
wake	13
up,	13
that	13
he	13
might	13
go	13
out	13
with	13
him	13
and	13
question	13
him	13
as	13
to	13
his	13
success.	13
Everything	13
fell	13
out	13
as	13
he	13
wished;	13
Lothario	13
awoke,	13
and	13
the	13
two	13
at	13
once	13
left	13
the	13
house,	13
and	13
Anselmo	13
asked	13
what	13
he	13
was	13
anxious	13
to	13
know,	13
and	13
Lothario	13
in	13
answer	13
told	13
him	13
that	13
he	13
had	13
not	13
thought	13
it	13
advisable	13
to	13
declare	13
himself	13
entirely	13
the	13
first	13
time,	13
and	13
therefore	13
had	13
only	13
extolled	13
the	13
charms	13
of	13
Camilla,	13
telling	13
her	13
that	13
all	13
the	13
city	13
spoke	13
of	13
nothing	13
else	13
but	13
her	13
beauty	13
and	13
wit,	13
for	13
this	13
seemed	13
to	13
him	13
an	13
excellent	13
way	13
of	13
beginning	13
to	13
gain	13
her	13
good-will	13
and	13
render	13
her	13
disposed	13
to	13
listen	13
to	13
him	13
with	13
pleasure	13
the	13
next	13
time,	13
thus	13
availing	13
himself	13
of	13
the	13
device	13
the	13
devil	13
has	13
recourse	13
to	13
when	13
he	13
would	13
deceive	13
one	13
who	13
is	13
on	13
the	13
watch;	13
for	13
he	13
being	13
the	13
angel	13
of	13
darkness	13
transforms	13
himself	13
into	13
an	13
angel	13
of	13
light,	13
and,	13
under	13
cover	13
of	13
a	13
fair	13
seeming,	13
discloses	13
himself	13
at	13
length,	13
and	13
effects	13
his	13
purpose	13
if	13
at	13
the	13
beginning	13
his	13
wiles	13
are	13
not	13
discovered.	13
All	13
this	13
gave	13
great	13
satisfaction	13
to	13
Anselmo,	13
and	13
he	13
said	13
he	13
would	13
afford	13
the	13
same	13
opportunity	13
every	13
day,	13
but	13
without	13
leaving	13
the	13
house,	13
for	13
he	13
would	13
find	13
things	13
to	13
do	13
at	13
home	13
so	13
that	13
Camilla	13
should	13
not	13
detect	13
the	13
plot.	13
Thus,	13
then,	13
several	13
days	13
went	13
by,	13
and	13
Lothario,	13
without	13
uttering	13
a	13
word	13
to	13
Camilla,	13
reported	13
to	13
Anselmo	13
that	13
he	13
had	13
talked	13
with	13
her	13
and	13
that	13
he	13
had	13
never	13
been	13
able	13
to	13
draw	13
from	13
her	13
the	13
slightest	13
indication	13
of	13
consent	13
to	13
anything	13
dishonourable,	13
nor	13
even	13
a	13
sign	13
or	13
shadow	13
of	13
hope;	13
on	13
the	13
contrary,	13
he	13
said	13
she	13
would	13
inform	13
her	13
husband	13
of	13
it.	13
“So	13
far	13
well,”	13
said	13
Anselmo;	13
“Camilla	13
has	13
thus	13
far	13
resisted	13
words;	13
we	13
must	13
now	13
see	13
how	13
she	13
will	13
resist	13
deeds.	13
I	13
will	13
give	13
you	13
to-morrow	13
two	13
thousand	13
crowns	13
in	13
gold	13
for	13
you	13
to	13
offer	13
or	13
even	13
present,	13
and	13
as	13
many	13
more	13
to	13
buy	13
jewels	13
to	13
lure	13
her,	13
for	13
women	13
are	13
fond	13
of	13
being	13
becomingly	13
attired	13
and	13
going	13
gaily	13
dressed,	13
and	13
all	13
the	13
more	13
so	13
if	13
they	13
are	13
beautiful,	13
however	13
chaste	13
they	13
may	13
be;	13
and	13
if	13
she	13
resists	13
this	13
temptation,	13
I	13
will	13
rest	13
satisfied	13
and	13
will	13
give	13
you	13
no	13
more	13
trouble.”	13
Lothario	13
replied	13
that	13
now	13
he	13
had	13
begun	13
he	13
would	13
carry	13
on	13
the	13
undertaking	13
to	13
the	13
end,	13
though	13
he	13
perceived	13
he	13
was	13
to	13
come	13
out	13
of	13
it	13
wearied	13
and	13
vanquished.	13
The	13
next	13
day	13
he	13
received	13
the	13
four	13
thousand	13
crowns,	13
and	13
with	13
them	13
four	13
thousand	13
perplexities,	13
for	13
he	13
knew	13
not	13
what	13
to	13
say	13
by	13
way	13
of	13
a	13
new	13
falsehood;	13
but	13
in	13
the	13
end	13
he	13
made	13
up	13
his	13
mind	13
to	13
tell	13
him	13
that	13
Camilla	13
stood	13
as	13
firm	13
against	13
gifts	13
and	13
promises	13
as	13
against	13
words,	13
and	13
that	13
there	13
was	13
no	13
use	13
in	13
taking	13
any	13
further	13
trouble,	13
for	13
the	13
time	13
was	13
all	13
spent	13
to	13
no	13
purpose.	13
But	13
chance,	13
directing	13
things	13
in	13
a	13
different	13
manner,	13
so	13
ordered	13
it	13
that	13
Anselmo,	13
having	13
left	13
Lothario	13
and	13
Camilla	13
alone	13
as	13
on	13
other	13
occasions,	13
shut	13
himself	13
into	13
a	13
chamber	13
and	13
posted	13
himself	13
to	13
watch	13
and	13
listen	13
through	13
the	13
keyhole	13
to	13
what	13
passed	13
between	13
them,	13
and	13
perceived	13
that	13
for	13
more	13
than	13
half	13
an	13
hour	13
Lothario	13
did	13
not	13
utter	13
a	13
word	13
to	13
Camilla,	13
nor	13
would	13
utter	13
a	13
word	13
though	13
he	13
were	13
to	13
be	13
there	13
for	13
an	13
age;	13
and	13
he	13
came	13
to	13
the	13
conclusion	13
that	13
what	13
his	13
friend	13
had	13
told	13
him	13
about	13
the	13
replies	13
of	13
Camilla	13
was	13
all	13
invention	13
and	13
falsehood,	13
and	13
to	13
ascertain	13
if	13
it	13
were	13
so,	13
he	13
came	13
out,	13
and	13
calling	13
Lothario	13
aside	13
asked	13
him	13
what	13
news	13
he	13
had	13
and	13
in	13
what	13
humour	13
Camilla	13
was.	13
Lothario	13
replied	13
that	13
he	13
was	13
not	13
disposed	13
to	13
go	13
on	13
with	13
the	13
business,	13
for	13
she	13
had	13
answered	13
him	13
so	13
angrily	13
and	13
harshly	13
that	13
he	13
had	13
no	13
heart	13
to	13
say	13
anything	13
more	13
to	13
her.	13
“Ah,	13
Lothario,	13
Lothario,”	13
said	13
Anselmo,	13
“how	13
ill	13
dost	13
thou	13
meet	13
thy	13
obligations	13
to	13
me,	13
and	13
the	13
great	13
confidence	13
I	13
repose	13
in	13
thee!	13
I	13
have	13
been	13
just	13
now	13
watching	13
through	13
this	13
keyhole,	13
and	13
I	13
have	13
seen	13
that	13
thou	13
hast	13
not	13
said	13
a	13
word	13
to	13
Camilla,	13
whence	13
I	13
conclude	13
that	13
on	13
the	13
former	13
occasions	13
thou	13
hast	13
not	13
spoken	13
to	13
her	13
either,	13
and	13
if	13
this	13
be	13
so,	13
as	13
no	13
doubt	13
it	13
is,	13
why	13
dost	13
thou	13
deceive	13
me,	13
or	13
wherefore	13
seekest	13
thou	13
by	13
craft	13
to	13
deprive	13
me	13
of	13
the	13
means	13
I	13
might	13
find	13
of	13
attaining	13
my	13
desire?”	13
Anselmo	13
said	13
no	13
more,	13
but	13
he	13
had	13
said	13
enough	13
to	13
cover	13
Lothario	13
with	13
shame	13
and	13
confusion,	13
and	13
he,	13
feeling	13
as	13
it	13
were	13
his	13
honour	13
touched	13
by	13
having	13
been	13
detected	13
in	13
a	13
lie,	13
swore	13
to	13
Anselmo	13
that	13
he	13
would	13
from	13
that	13
moment	13
devote	13
himself	13
to	13
satisfying	13
him	13
without	13
any	13
deception,	13
as	13
he	13
would	13
see	13
if	13
he	13
had	13
the	13
curiosity	13
to	13
watch;	13
though	13
he	13
need	13
not	13
take	13
the	13
trouble,	13
for	13
the	13
pains	13
he	13
would	13
take	13
to	13
satisfy	13
him	13
would	13
remove	13
all	13
suspicions	13
from	13
his	13
mind.	13
Anselmo	13
believed	13
him,	13
and	13
to	13
afford	13
him	13
an	13
opportunity	13
more	13
free	13
and	13
less	13
liable	13
to	13
surprise,	13
he	13
resolved	13
to	13
absent	13
himself	13
from	13
his	13
house	13
for	13
eight	13
days,	13
betaking	13
himself	13
to	13
that	13
of	13
a	13
friend	13
of	13
his	13
who	13
lived	13
in	13
a	13
village	13
not	13
far	13
from	13
the	13
city;	13
and,	13
the	13
better	13
to	13
account	13
for	13
his	13
departure	13
to	13
Camilla,	13
he	13
so	13
arranged	13
it	13
that	13
the	13
friend	13
should	13
send	13
him	13
a	13
very	13
pressing	13
invitation.	13
Unhappy,	13
shortsighted	13
Anselmo,	13
what	13
art	13
thou	13
doing,	13
what	13
art	13
thou	13
plotting,	13
what	13
art	13
thou	13
devising?	13
Bethink	13
thee	13
thou	13
art	13
working	13
against	13
thyself,	13
plotting	13
thine	13
own	13
dishonour,	13
devising	13
thine	13
own	13
ruin.	13
Thy	13
wife	13
Camilla	13
is	13
virtuous,	13
thou	13
dost	13
possess	13
her	13
in	13
peace	13
and	13
quietness,	13
no	13
one	13
assails	13
thy	13
happiness,	13
her	13
thoughts	13
wander	13
not	13
beyond	13
the	13
walls	13
of	13
thy	13
house,	13
thou	13
art	13
her	13
heaven	13
on	13
earth,	13
the	13
object	13
of	13
her	13
wishes,	13
the	13
fulfilment	13
of	13
her	13
desires,	13
the	13
measure	13
wherewith	13
she	13
measures	13
her	13
will,	13
making	13
it	13
conform	13
in	13
all	13
things	13
to	13
thine	13
and	13
Heaven’s.	13
If,	13
then,	13
the	13
mine	13
of	13
her	13
honour,	13
beauty,	13
virtue,	13
and	13
modesty	13
yields	13
thee	13
without	13
labour	13
all	13
the	13
wealth	13
it	13
contains	13
and	13
thou	13
canst	13
wish	13
for,	13
why	13
wilt	13
thou	13
dig	13
the	13
earth	13
in	13
search	13
of	13
fresh	13
veins,	13
of	13
new	13
unknown	13
treasure,	13
risking	13
the	13
collapse	13
of	13
all,	13
since	13
it	13
but	13
rests	13
on	13
the	13
feeble	13
props	13
of	13
her	13
weak	13
nature?	13
Bethink	13
thee	13
that	13
from	13
him	13
who	13
seeks	13
impossibilities	13
that	13
which	13
is	13
possible	13
may	13
with	13
justice	13
be	13
withheld,	13
as	13
was	13
better	13
expressed	13
by	13
a	13
poet	13
who	13
said:	13
’Tis	13
mine	13
to	13
seek	13
for	13
life	13
in	13
death,	13
Health	13
in	13
disease	13
seek	13
I,	13
I	13
seek	13
in	13
prison	13
freedom’s	13
breath,	13
In	13
traitors	13
loyalty.	13
So	13
Fate	13
that	13
ever	13
scorns	13
to	13
grant	13
Or	13
grace	13
or	13
boon	13
to	13
me,	13
Since	13
what	13
can	13
never	13
be	13
I	13
want,	13
Denies	13
me	13
what	13
might	13
be.	13
The	13
next	13
day	13
Anselmo	13
took	13
his	13
departure	13
for	13
the	13
village,	13
leaving	13
instructions	13
with	13
Camilla	13
that	13
during	13
his	13
absence	13
Lothario	13
would	13
come	13
to	13
look	13
after	13
his	13
house	13
and	13
to	13
dine	13
with	13
her,	13
and	13
that	13
she	13
was	13
to	13
treat	13
him	13
as	13
she	13
would	13
himself.	13
Camilla	13
was	13
distressed,	13
as	13
a	13
discreet	13
and	13
right-minded	13
woman	13
would	13
be,	13
at	13
the	13
orders	13
her	13
husband	13
left	13
her,	13
and	13
bade	13
him	13
remember	13
that	13
it	13
was	13
not	13
becoming	13
that	13
anyone	13
should	13
occupy	13
his	13
seat	13
at	13
the	13
table	13
during	13
his	13
absence,	13
and	13
if	13
he	13
acted	13
thus	13
from	13
not	13
feeling	13
confidence	13
that	13
she	13
would	13
be	13
able	13
to	13
manage	13
his	13
house,	13
let	13
him	13
try	13
her	13
this	13
time,	13
and	13
he	13
would	13
find	13
by	13
experience	13
that	13
she	13
was	13
equal	13
to	13
greater	13
responsibilities.	13
Anselmo	13
replied	13
that	13
it	13
was	13
his	13
pleasure	13
to	13
have	13
it	13
so,	13
and	13
that	13
she	13
had	13
only	13
to	13
submit	13
and	13
obey.	13
Camilla	13
said	13
she	13
would	13
do	13
so,	13
though	13
against	13
her	13
will.	13
Anselmo	13
went,	13
and	13
the	13
next	13
day	13
Lothario	13
came	13
to	13
his	13
house,	13
where	13
he	13
was	13
received	13
by	13
Camilla	13
with	13
a	13
friendly	13
and	13
modest	13
welcome;	13
but	13
she	13
never	13
suffered	13
Lothario	13
to	13
see	13
her	13
alone,	13
for	13
she	13
was	13
always	13
attended	13
by	13
her	13
men	13
and	13
women	13
servants,	13
especially	13
by	13
a	13
handmaid	13
of	13
hers,	13
Leonela	13
by	13
name,	13
to	13
whom	13
she	13
was	13
much	13
attached	13
(for	13
they	13
had	13
been	13
brought	13
up	13
together	13
from	13
childhood	13
in	13
her	13
father’s	13
house),	13
and	13
whom	13
she	13
had	13
kept	13
with	13
her	13
after	13
her	13
marriage	13
with	13
Anselmo.	13
The	13
first	13
three	13
days	13
Lothario	13
did	13
not	13
speak	13
to	13
her,	13
though	13
he	13
might	13
have	13
done	13
so	13
when	13
they	13
removed	13
the	13
cloth	13
and	13
the	13
servants	13
retired	13
to	13
dine	13
hastily;	13
for	13
such	13
were	13
Camilla’s	13
orders;	13
nay	13
more,	13
Leonela	13
had	13
directions	13
to	13
dine	13
earlier	13
than	13
Camilla	13
and	13
never	13
to	13
leave	13
her	13
side.	13
She,	13
however,	13
having	13
her	13
thoughts	13
fixed	13
upon	13
other	13
things	13
more	13
to	13
her	13
taste,	13
and	13
wanting	13
that	13
time	13
and	13
opportunity	13
for	13
her	13
own	13
pleasures,	13
did	13
not	13
always	13
obey	13
her	13
mistress’s	13
commands,	13
but	13
on	13
the	13
contrary	13
left	13
them	13
alone,	13
as	13
if	13
they	13
had	13
ordered	13
her	13
to	13
do	13
so;	13
but	13
the	13
modest	13
bearing	13
of	13
Camilla,	13
the	13
calmness	13
of	13
her	13
countenance,	13
the	13
composure	13
of	13
her	13
aspect	13
were	13
enough	13
to	13
bridle	13
the	13
tongue	13
of	13
Lothario.	13
But	13
the	13
influence	13
which	13
the	13
many	13
virtues	13
of	13
Camilla	13
exerted	13
in	13
imposing	13
silence	13
on	13
Lothario’s	13
tongue	13
proved	13
mischievous	13
for	13
both	13
of	13
them,	13
for	13
if	13
his	13
tongue	13
was	13
silent	13
his	13
thoughts	13
were	13
busy,	13
and	13
could	13
dwell	13
at	13
leisure	13
upon	13
the	13
perfections	13
of	13
Camilla’s	13
goodness	13
and	13
beauty	13
one	13
by	13
one,	13
charms	13
enough	13
to	13
warm	13
with	13
love	13
a	13
marble	13
statue,	13
not	13
to	13
say	13
a	13
heart	13
of	13
flesh.	13
Lothario	13
gazed	13
upon	13
her	13
when	13
he	13
might	13
have	13
been	13
speaking	13
to	13
her,	13
and	13
thought	13
how	13
worthy	13
of	13
being	13
loved	13
she	13
was;	13
and	13
thus	13
reflection	13
began	13
little	13
by	13
little	13
to	13
assail	13
his	13
allegiance	13
to	13
Anselmo,	13
and	13
a	13
thousand	13
times	13
he	13
thought	13
of	13
withdrawing	13
from	13
the	13
city	13
and	13
going	13
where	13
Anselmo	13
should	13
never	13
see	13
him	13
nor	13
he	13
see	13
Camilla.	13
But	13
already	13
the	13
delight	13
he	13
found	13
in	13
gazing	13
on	13
her	13
interposed	13
and	13
held	13
him	13
fast.	13
He	13
put	13
a	13
constraint	13
upon	13
himself,	13
and	13
struggled	13
to	13
repel	13
and	13
repress	13
the	13
pleasure	13
he	13
found	13
in	13
contemplating	13
Camilla;	13
when	13
alone	13
he	13
blamed	13
himself	13
for	13
his	13
weakness,	13
called	13
himself	13
a	13
bad	13
friend,	13
nay	13
a	13
bad	13
Christian;	13
then	13
he	13
argued	13
the	13
matter	13
and	13
compared	13
himself	13
with	13
Anselmo;	13
always	13
coming	13
to	13
the	13
conclusion	13
that	13
the	13
folly	13
and	13
rashness	13
of	13
Anselmo	13
had	13
been	13
worse	13
than	13
his	13
faithlessness,	13
and	13
that	13
if	13
he	13
could	13
excuse	13
his	13
intentions	13
as	13
easily	13
before	13
God	13
as	13
with	13
man,	13
he	13
had	13
no	13
reason	13
to	13
fear	13
any	13
punishment	13
for	13
his	13
offence.	13
In	13
short	13
the	13
beauty	13
and	13
goodness	13
of	13
Camilla,	13
joined	13
with	13
the	13
opportunity	13
which	13
the	13
blind	13
husband	13
had	13
placed	13
in	13
his	13
hands,	13
overthrew	13
the	13
loyalty	13
of	13
Lothario;	13
and	13
giving	13
heed	13
to	13
nothing	13
save	13
the	13
object	13
towards	13
which	13
his	13
inclinations	13
led	13
him,	13
after	13
Anselmo	13
had	13
been	13
three	13
days	13
absent,	13
during	13
which	13
he	13
had	13
been	13
carrying	13
on	13
a	13
continual	13
struggle	13
with	13
his	13
passion,	13
he	13
began	13
to	13
make	13
love	13
to	13
Camilla	13
with	13
so	13
much	13
vehemence	13
and	13
warmth	13
of	13
language	13
that	13
she	13
was	13
overwhelmed	13
with	13
amazement,	13
and	13
could	13
only	13
rise	13
from	13
her	13
place	13
and	13
retire	13
to	13
her	13
room	13
without	13
answering	13
him	13
a	13
word.	13
But	13
the	13
hope	13
which	13
always	13
springs	13
up	13
with	13
love	13
was	13
not	13
weakened	13
in	13
Lothario	13
by	13
this	13
repelling	13
demeanour;	13
on	13
the	13
contrary	13
his	13
passion	13
for	13
Camilla	13
increased,	13
and	13
she	13
discovering	13
in	13
him	13
what	13
she	13
had	13
never	13
expected,	13
knew	13
not	13
what	13
to	13
do;	13
and	13
considering	13
it	13
neither	13
safe	13
nor	13
right	13
to	13
give	13
him	13
the	13
chance	13
or	13
opportunity	13
of	13
speaking	13
to	13
her	13
again,	13
she	13
resolved	13
to	13
send,	13
as	13
she	13
did	13
that	13
very	13
night,	13
one	13
of	13
her	13
servants	13
with	13
a	13
letter	13
to	13
Anselmo,	13
in	13
which	13
she	13
addressed	13
the	13
following	13
words	13
to	13
him.	13
CHAPTER	13
XXXIV.	13
IN	13
WHICH	13
IS	13
CONTINUED	13
THE	13
NOVEL	13
OF	13
“THE	13
ILL-ADVISED	13
CURIOSITY”	13
“It	13
is	13
commonly	13
said	13
that	13
an	13
army	13
looks	13
ill	13
without	13
its	13
general	13
and	13
a	13
castle	13
without	13
its	13
castellan,	13
and	13
I	13
say	13
that	13
a	13
young	13
married	13
woman	13
looks	13
still	13
worse	13
without	13
her	13
husband	13
unless	13
there	13
are	13
very	13
good	13
reasons	13
for	13
it.	13
I	13
find	13
myself	13
so	13
ill	13
at	13
ease	13
without	13
you,	13
and	13
so	13
incapable	13
of	13
enduring	13
this	13
separation,	13
that	13
unless	13
you	13
return	13
quickly	13
I	13
shall	13
have	13
to	13
go	13
for	13
relief	13
to	13
my	13
parents’	13
house,	13
even	13
if	13
I	13
leave	13
yours	13
without	13
a	13
protector;	13
for	13
the	13
one	13
you	13
left	13
me,	13
if	13
indeed	13
he	13
deserved	13
that	13
title,	13
has,	13
I	13
think,	13
more	13
regard	13
to	13
his	13
own	13
pleasure	13
than	13
to	13
what	13
concerns	13
you:	13
as	13
you	13
are	13
possessed	13
of	13
discernment	13
I	13
need	13
say	13
no	13
more	13
to	13
you,	13
nor	13
indeed	13
is	13
it	13
fitting	13
I	13
should	13
say	13
more.”	13
Anselmo	13
received	13
this	13
letter,	13
and	13
from	13
it	13
he	13
gathered	13
that	13
Lothario	13
had	13
already	13
begun	13
his	13
task	13
and	13
that	13
Camilla	13
must	13
have	13
replied	13
to	13
him	13
as	13
he	13
would	13
have	13
wished;	13
and	13
delighted	13
beyond	13
measure	13
at	13
such	13
intelligence	13
he	13
sent	13
word	13
to	13
her	13
not	13
to	13
leave	13
his	13
house	13
on	13
any	13
account,	13
as	13
he	13
would	13
very	13
shortly	13
return.	13
Camilla	13
was	13
astonished	13
at	13
Anselmo’s	13
reply,	13
which	13
placed	13
her	13
in	13
greater	13
perplexity	13
than	13
before,	13
for	13
she	13
neither	13
dared	13
to	13
remain	13
in	13
her	13
own	13
house,	13
nor	13
yet	13
to	13
go	13
to	13
her	13
parents’;	13
for	13
in	13
remaining	13
her	13
virtue	13
was	13
imperilled,	13
and	13
in	13
going	13
she	13
was	13
opposing	13
her	13
husband’s	13
commands.	13
Finally	13
she	13
decided	13
upon	13
what	13
was	13
the	13
worse	13
course	13
for	13
her,	13
to	13
remain,	13
resolving	13
not	13
to	13
fly	13
from	13
the	13
presence	13
of	13
Lothario,	13
that	13
she	13
might	13
not	13
give	13
food	13
for	13
gossip	13
to	13
her	13
servants;	13
and	13
she	13
now	13
began	13
to	13
regret	13
having	13
written	13
as	13
she	13
had	13
to	13
her	13
husband,	13
fearing	13
he	13
might	13
imagine	13
that	13
Lothario	13
had	13
perceived	13
in	13
her	13
some	13
lightness	13
which	13
had	13
impelled	13
him	13
to	13
lay	13
aside	13
the	13
respect	13
he	13
owed	13
her;	13
but	13
confident	13
of	13
her	13
rectitude	13
she	13
put	13
her	13
trust	13
in	13
God	13
and	13
in	13
her	13
own	13
virtuous	13
intentions,	13
with	13
which	13
she	13
hoped	13
to	13
resist	13
in	13
silence	13
all	13
the	13
solicitations	13
of	13
Lothario,	13
without	13
saying	13
anything	13
to	13
her	13
husband	13
so	13
as	13
not	13
to	13
involve	13
him	13
in	13
any	13
quarrel	13
or	13
trouble;	13
and	13
she	13
even	13
began	13
to	13
consider	13
how	13
to	13
excuse	13
Lothario	13
to	13
Anselmo	13
when	13
he	13
should	13
ask	13
her	13
what	13
it	13
was	13
that	13
induced	13
her	13
to	13
write	13
that	13
letter.	13
With	13
these	13
resolutions,	13
more	13
honourable	13
than	13
judicious	13
or	13
effectual,	13
she	13
remained	13
the	13
next	13
day	13
listening	13
to	13
Lothario,	13
who	13
pressed	13
his	13
suit	13
so	13
strenuously	13
that	13
Camilla’s	13
firmness	13
began	13
to	13
waver,	13
and	13
her	13
virtue	13
had	13
enough	13
to	13
do	13
to	13
come	13
to	13
the	13
rescue	13
of	13
her	13
eyes	13
and	13
keep	13
them	13
from	13
showing	13
signs	13
of	13
a	13
certain	13
tender	13
compassion	13
which	13
the	13
tears	13
and	13
appeals	13
of	13
Lothario	13
had	13
awakened	13
in	13
her	13
bosom.	13
Lothario	13
observed	13
all	13
this,	13
and	13
it	13
inflamed	13
him	13
all	13
the	13
more.	13
In	13
short	13
he	13
felt	13
that	13
while	13
Anselmo’s	13
absence	13
afforded	13
time	13
and	13
opportunity	13
he	13
must	13
press	13
the	13
siege	13
of	13
the	13
fortress,	13
and	13
so	13
he	13
assailed	13
her	13
self-esteem	13
with	13
praises	13
of	13
her	13
beauty,	13
for	13
there	13
is	13
nothing	13
that	13
more	13
quickly	13
reduces	13
and	13
levels	13
the	13
castle	13
towers	13
of	13
fair	13
women’s	13
vanity	13
than	13
vanity	13
itself	13
upon	13
the	13
tongue	13
of	13
flattery.	13
In	13
fact	13
with	13
the	13
utmost	13
assiduity	13
he	13
undermined	13
the	13
rock	13
of	13
her	13
purity	13
with	13
such	13
engines	13
that	13
had	13
Camilla	13
been	13
of	13
brass	13
she	13
must	13
have	13
fallen.	13
He	13
wept,	13
he	13
entreated,	13
he	13
promised,	13
he	13
flattered,	13
he	13
importuned,	13
he	13
pretended	13
with	13
so	13
much	13
feeling	13
and	13
apparent	13
sincerity,	13
that	13
he	13
overthrew	13
the	13
virtuous	13
resolves	13
of	13
Camilla	13
and	13
won	13
the	13
triumph	13
he	13
least	13
expected	13
and	13
most	13
longed	13
for.	13
Camilla	13
yielded,	13
Camilla	13
fell;	13
but	13
what	13
wonder	13
if	13
the	13
friendship	13
of	13
Lothario	13
could	13
not	13
stand	13
firm?	13
A	13
clear	13
proof	13
to	13
us	13
that	13
the	13
passion	13
of	13
love	13
is	13
to	13
be	13
conquered	13
only	13
by	13
flying	13
from	13
it,	13
and	13
that	13
no	13
one	13
should	13
engage	13
in	13
a	13
struggle	13
with	13
an	13
enemy	13
so	13
mighty;	13
for	13
divine	13
strength	13
is	13
needed	13
to	13
overcome	13
his	13
human	13
power.	13
Leonela	13
alone	13
knew	13
of	13
her	13
mistress’s	13
weakness,	13
for	13
the	13
two	13
false	13
friends	13
and	13
new	13
lovers	13
were	13
unable	13
to	13
conceal	13
it.	13
Lothario	13
did	13
not	13
care	13
to	13
tell	13
Camilla	13
the	13
object	13
Anselmo	13
had	13
in	13
view,	13
nor	13
that	13
he	13
had	13
afforded	13
him	13
the	13
opportunity	13
of	13
attaining	13
such	13
a	13
result,	13
lest	13
she	13
should	13
undervalue	13
his	13
love	13
and	13
think	13
that	13
it	13
was	13
by	13
chance	13
and	13
without	13
intending	13
it	13
and	13
not	13
of	13
his	13
own	13
accord	13
that	13
he	13
had	13
made	13
love	13
to	13
her.	13
A	13
few	13
days	13
later	13
Anselmo	13
returned	13
to	13
his	13
house	13
and	13
did	13
not	13
perceive	13
what	13
it	13
had	13
lost,	13
that	13
which	13
he	13
so	13
lightly	13
treated	13
and	13
so	13
highly	13
prized.	13
He	13
went	13
at	13
once	13
to	13
see	13
Lothario,	13
and	13
found	13
him	13
at	13
home;	13
they	13
embraced	13
each	13
other,	13
and	13
Anselmo	13
asked	13
for	13
the	13
tidings	13
of	13
his	13
life	13
or	13
his	13
death.	13
“The	13
tidings	13
I	13
have	13
to	13
give	13
thee,	13
Anselmo	13
my	13
friend,”	13
said	13
Lothario,	13
“are	13
that	13
thou	13
dost	13
possess	13
a	13
wife	13
that	13
is	13
worthy	13
to	13
be	13
the	13
pattern	13
and	13
crown	13
of	13
all	13
good	13
wives.	13
The	13
words	13
that	13
I	13
have	13
addressed	13
to	13
her	13
were	13
borne	13
away	13
on	13
the	13
wind,	13
my	13
promises	13
have	13
been	13
despised,	13
my	13
presents	13
have	13
been	13
refused,	13
such	13
feigned	13
tears	13
as	13
I	13
shed	13
have	13
been	13
turned	13
into	13
open	13
ridicule.	13
In	13
short,	13
as	13
Camilla	13
is	13
the	13
essence	13
of	13
all	13
beauty,	13
so	13
is	13
she	13
the	13
treasure-house	13
where	13
purity	13
dwells,	13
and	13
gentleness	13
and	13
modesty	13
abide	13
with	13
all	13
the	13
virtues	13
that	13
can	13
confer	13
praise,	13
honour,	13
and	13
happiness	13
upon	13
a	13
woman.	13
Take	13
back	13
thy	13
money,	13
my	13
friend;	13
here	13
it	13
is,	13
and	13
I	13
have	13
had	13
no	13
need	13
to	13
touch	13
it,	13
for	13
the	13
chastity	13
of	13
Camilla	13
yields	13
not	13
to	13
things	13
so	13
base	13
as	13
gifts	13
or	13
promises.	13
Be	13
content,	13
Anselmo,	13
and	13
refrain	13
from	13
making	13
further	13
proof;	13
and	13
as	13
thou	13
hast	13
passed	13
dryshod	13
through	13
the	13
sea	13
of	13
those	13
doubts	13
and	13
suspicions	13
that	13
are	13
and	13
may	13
be	13
entertained	13
of	13
women,	13
seek	13
not	13
to	13
plunge	13
again	13
into	13
the	13
deep	13
ocean	13
of	13
new	13
embarrassments,	13
or	13
with	13
another	13
pilot	13
make	13
trial	13
of	13
the	13
goodness	13
and	13
strength	13
of	13
the	13
bark	13
that	13
Heaven	13
has	13
granted	13
thee	13
for	13
thy	13
passage	13
across	13
the	13
sea	13
of	13
this	13
world;	13
but	13
reckon	13
thyself	13
now	13
safe	13
in	13
port,	13
moor	13
thyself	13
with	13
the	13
anchor	13
of	13
sound	13
reflection,	13
and	13
rest	13
in	13
peace	13
until	13
thou	13
art	13
called	13
upon	13
to	13
pay	13
that	13
debt	13
which	13
no	13
nobility	13
on	13
earth	13
can	13
escape	13
paying.”	13
Anselmo	13
was	13
completely	13
satisfied	13
by	13
the	13
words	13
of	13
Lothario,	13
and	13
believed	13
them	13
as	13
fully	13
as	13
if	13
they	13
had	13
been	13
spoken	13
by	13
an	13
oracle;	13
nevertheless	13
he	13
begged	13
of	13
him	13
not	13
to	13
relinquish	13
the	13
undertaking,	13
were	13
it	13
but	13
for	13
the	13
sake	13
of	13
curiosity	13
and	13
amusement;	13
though	13
thenceforward	13
he	13
need	13
not	13
make	13
use	13
of	13
the	13
same	13
earnest	13
endeavours	13
as	13
before;	13
all	13
he	13
wished	13
him	13
to	13
do	13
was	13
to	13
write	13
some	13
verses	13
to	13
her,	13
praising	13
her	13
under	13
the	13
name	13
of	13
Chloris,	13
for	13
he	13
himself	13
would	13
give	13
her	13
to	13
understand	13
that	13
he	13
was	13
in	13
love	13
with	13
a	13
lady	13
to	13
whom	13
he	13
had	13
given	13
that	13
name	13
to	13
enable	13
him	13
to	13
sing	13
her	13
praises	13
with	13
the	13
decorum	13
due	13
to	13
her	13
modesty;	13
and	13
if	13
Lothario	13
were	13
unwilling	13
to	13
take	13
the	13
trouble	13
of	13
writing	13
the	13
verses	13
he	13
would	13
compose	13
them	13
himself.	13
“That	13
will	13
not	13
be	13
necessary,”	13
said	13
Lothario,	13
“for	13
the	13
muses	13
are	13
not	13
such	13
enemies	13
of	13
mine	13
but	13
that	13
they	13
visit	13
me	13
now	13
and	13
then	13
in	13
the	13
course	13
of	13
the	13
year.	13
Do	13
thou	13
tell	13
Camilla	13
what	13
thou	13
hast	13
proposed	13
about	13
a	13
pretended	13
amour	13
of	13
mine;	13
as	13
for	13
the	13
verses	13
I	13
will	13
make	13
them,	13
and	13
if	13
not	13
as	13
good	13
as	13
the	13
subject	13
deserves,	13
they	13
shall	13
be	13
at	13
least	13
the	13
best	13
I	13
can	13
produce.”	13
An	13
agreement	13
to	13
this	13
effect	13
was	13
made	13
between	13
the	13
friends,	13
the	13
ill-advised	13
one	13
and	13
the	13
treacherous,	13
and	13
Anselmo	13
returning	13
to	13
his	13
house	13
asked	13
Camilla	13
the	13
question	13
she	13
already	13
wondered	13
he	13
had	13
not	13
asked	13
before—what	13
it	13
was	13
that	13
had	13
caused	13
her	13
to	13
write	13
the	13
letter	13
she	13
had	13
sent	13
him.	13
Camilla	13
replied	13
that	13
it	13
had	13
seemed	13
to	13
her	13
that	13
Lothario	13
looked	13
at	13
her	13
somewhat	13
more	13
freely	13
than	13
when	13
he	13
had	13
been	13
at	13
home;	13
but	13
that	13
now	13
she	13
was	13
undeceived	13
and	13
believed	13
it	13
to	13
have	13
been	13
only	13
her	13
own	13
imagination,	13
for	13
Lothario	13
now	13
avoided	13
seeing	13
her,	13
or	13
being	13
alone	13
with	13
her.	13
Anselmo	13
told	13
her	13
she	13
might	13
be	13
quite	13
easy	13
on	13
the	13
score	13
of	13
that	13
suspicion,	13
for	13
he	13
knew	13
that	13
Lothario	13
was	13
in	13
love	13
with	13
a	13
damsel	13
of	13
rank	13
in	13
the	13
city	13
whom	13
he	13
celebrated	13
under	13
the	13
name	13
of	13
Chloris,	13
and	13
that	13
even	13
if	13
he	13
were	13
not,	13
his	13
fidelity	13
and	13
their	13
great	13
friendship	13
left	13
no	13
room	13
for	13
fear.	13
Had	13
not	13
Camilla,	13
however,	13
been	13
informed	13
beforehand	13
by	13
Lothario	13
that	13
this	13
love	13
for	13
Chloris	13
was	13
a	13
pretence,	13
and	13
that	13
he	13
himself	13
had	13
told	13
Anselmo	13
of	13
it	13
in	13
order	13
to	13
be	13
able	13
sometimes	13
to	13
give	13
utterance	13
to	13
the	13
praises	13
of	13
Camilla	13
herself,	13
no	13
doubt	13
she	13
would	13
have	13
fallen	13
into	13
the	13
despairing	13
toils	13
of	13
jealousy;	13
but	13
being	13
forewarned	13
she	13
received	13
the	13
startling	13
news	13
without	13
uneasiness.	13
The	13
next	13
day	13
as	13
the	13
three	13
were	13
at	13
table	13
Anselmo	13
asked	13
Lothario	13
to	13
recite	13
something	13
of	13
what	13
he	13
had	13
composed	13
for	13
his	13
mistress	13
Chloris;	13
for	13
as	13
Camilla	13
did	13
not	13
know	13
her,	13
he	13
might	13
safely	13
say	13
what	13
he	13
liked.	13
“Even	13
did	13
she	13
know	13
her,”	13
returned	13
Lothario,	13
“I	13
would	13
hide	13
nothing,	13
for	13
when	13
a	13
lover	13
praises	13
his	13
lady’s	13
beauty,	13
and	13
charges	13
her	13
with	13
cruelty,	13
he	13
casts	13
no	13
imputation	13
upon	13
her	13
fair	13
name;	13
at	13
any	13
rate,	13
all	13
I	13
can	13
say	13
is	13
that	13
yesterday	13
I	13
made	13
a	13
sonnet	13
on	13
the	13
ingratitude	13
of	13
this	13
Chloris,	13
which	13
goes	13
thus:	13
SONNET	13
At	13
midnight,	13
in	13
the	13
silence,	13
when	13
the	13
eyes	13
Of	13
happier	13
mortals	13
balmy	13
slumbers	13
close,	13
The	13
weary	13
tale	13
of	13
my	13
unnumbered	13
woes	13
To	13
Chloris	13
and	13
to	13
Heaven	13
is	13
wont	13
to	13
rise.	13
And	13
when	13
the	13
light	13
of	13
day	13
returning	13
dyes	13
The	13
portals	13
of	13
the	13
east	13
with	13
tints	13
of	13
rose,	13
With	13
undiminished	13
force	13
my	13
sorrow	13
flows	13
In	13
broken	13
accents	13
and	13
in	13
burning	13
sighs.	13
And	13
when	13
the	13
sun	13
ascends	13
his	13
star-girt	13
throne,	13
And	13
on	13
the	13
earth	13
pours	13
down	13
his	13
midday	13
beams,	13
Noon	13
but	13
renews	13
my	13
wailing	13
and	13
my	13
tears;	13
And	13
with	13
the	13
night	13
again	13
goes	13
up	13
my	13
moan.	13
Yet	13
ever	13
in	13
my	13
agony	13
it	13
seems	13
To	13
me	13
that	13
neither	13
Heaven	13
nor	13
Chloris	13
hears.”	13
The	13
sonnet	13
pleased	13
Camilla,	13
and	13
still	13
more	13
Anselmo,	13
for	13
he	13
praised	13
it	13
and	13
said	13
the	13
lady	13
was	13
excessively	13
cruel	13
who	13
made	13
no	13
return	13
for	13
sincerity	13
so	13
manifest.	13
On	13
which	13
Camilla	13
said,	13
“Then	13
all	13
that	13
love-smitten	13
poets	13
say	13
is	13
true?”	13
“As	13
poets	13
they	13
do	13
not	13
tell	13
the	13
truth,”	13
replied	13
Lothario;	13
“but	13
as	13
lovers	13
they	13
are	13
not	13
more	13
defective	13
in	13
expression	13
than	13
they	13
are	13
truthful.”	13
“There	13
is	13
no	13
doubt	13
of	13
that,”	13
observed	13
Anselmo,	13
anxious	13
to	13
support	13
and	13
uphold	13
Lothario’s	13
ideas	13
with	13
Camilla,	13
who	13
was	13
as	13
regardless	13
of	13
his	13
design	13
as	13
she	13
was	13
deep	13
in	13
love	13
with	13
Lothario;	13
and	13
so	13
taking	13
delight	13
in	13
anything	13
that	13
was	13
his,	13
and	13
knowing	13
that	13
his	13
thoughts	13
and	13
writings	13
had	13
her	13
for	13
their	13
object,	13
and	13
that	13
she	13
herself	13
was	13
the	13
real	13
Chloris,	13
she	13
asked	13
him	13
to	13
repeat	13
some	13
other	13
sonnet	13
or	13
verses	13
if	13
he	13
recollected	13
any.	13
“I	13
do,”	13
replied	13
Lothario,	13
“but	13
I	13
do	13
not	13
think	13
it	13
as	13
good	13
as	13
the	13
first	13
one,	13
or,	13
more	13
correctly	13
speaking,	13
less	13
bad;	13
but	13
you	13
can	13
easily	13
judge,	13
for	13
it	13
is	13
this.	13
SONNET	13
I	13
know	13
that	13
I	13
am	13
doomed;	13
death	13
is	13
to	13
me	13
As	13
certain	13
as	13
that	13
thou,	13
ungrateful	13
fair,	13
Dead	13
at	13
thy	13
feet	13
shouldst	13
see	13
me	13
lying,	13
ere	13
My	13
heart	13
repented	13
of	13
its	13
love	13
for	13
thee.	13
If	13
buried	13
in	13
oblivion	13
I	13
should	13
be,	13
Bereft	13
of	13
life,	13
fame,	13
favour,	13
even	13
there	13
It	13
would	13
be	13
found	13
that	13
I	13
thy	13
image	13
bear	13
Deep	13
graven	13
in	13
my	13
breast	13
for	13
all	13
to	13
see.	13
This	13
like	13
some	13
holy	13
relic	13
do	13
I	13
prize	13
To	13
save	13
me	13
from	13
the	13
fate	13
my	13
truth	13
entails,	13
Truth	13
that	13
to	13
thy	13
hard	13
heart	13
its	13
vigour	13
owes.	13
Alas	13
for	13
him	13
that	13
under	13
lowering	13
skies,	13
In	13
peril	13
o’er	13
a	13
trackless	13
ocean	13
sails,	13
Where	13
neither	13
friendly	13
port	13
nor	13
pole-star	13
shows.”	13
Anselmo	13
praised	13
this	13
second	13
sonnet	13
too,	13
as	13
he	13
had	13
praised	13
the	13
first;	13
and	13
so	13
he	13
went	13
on	13
adding	13
link	13
after	13
link	13
to	13
the	13
chain	13
with	13
which	13
he	13
was	13
binding	13
himself	13
and	13
making	13
his	13
dishonour	13
secure;	13
for	13
when	13
Lothario	13
was	13
doing	13
most	13
to	13
dishonour	13
him	13
he	13
told	13
him	13
he	13
was	13
most	13
honoured;	13
and	13
thus	13
each	13
step	13
that	13
Camilla	13
descended	13
towards	13
the	13
depths	13
of	13
her	13
abasement,	13
she	13
mounted,	13
in	13
his	13
opinion,	13
towards	13
the	13
summit	13
of	13
virtue	13
and	13
fair	13
fame.	13
It	13
so	13
happened	13
that	13
finding	13
herself	13
on	13
one	13
occasion	13
alone	13
with	13
her	13
maid,	13
Camilla	13
said	13
to	13
her,	13
“I	13
am	13
ashamed	13
to	13
think,	13
my	13
dear	13
Leonela,	13
how	13
lightly	13
I	13
have	13
valued	13
myself	13
that	13
I	13
did	13
not	13
compel	13
Lothario	13
to	13
purchase	13
by	13
at	13
least	13
some	13
expenditure	13
of	13
time	13
that	13
full	13
possession	13
of	13
me	13
that	13
I	13
so	13
quickly	13
yielded	13
him	13
of	13
my	13
own	13
free	13
will.	13
I	13
fear	13
that	13
he	13
will	13
think	13
ill	13
of	13
my	13
pliancy	13
or	13
lightness,	13
not	13
considering	13
the	13
irresistible	13
influence	13
he	13
brought	13
to	13
bear	13
upon	13
me.”	13
“Let	13
not	13
that	13
trouble	13
you,	13
my	13
lady,”	13
said	13
Leonela,	13
“for	13
it	13
does	13
not	13
take	13
away	13
the	13
value	13
of	13
the	13
thing	13
given	13
or	13
make	13
it	13
the	13
less	13
precious	13
to	13
give	13
it	13
quickly	13
if	13
it	13
be	13
really	13
valuable	13
and	13
worthy	13
of	13
being	13
prized;	13
nay,	13
they	13
are	13
wont	13
to	13
say	13
that	13
he	13
who	13
gives	13
quickly	13
gives	13
twice.”	13
“They	13
say	13
also,”	13
said	13
Camilla,	13
“that	13
what	13
costs	13
little	13
is	13
valued	13
less.”	13
“That	13
saying	13
does	13
not	13
hold	13
good	13
in	13
your	13
case,”	13
replied	13
Leonela,	13
“for	13
love,	13
as	13
I	13
have	13
heard	13
say,	13
sometimes	13
flies	13
and	13
sometimes	13
walks;	13
with	13
this	13
one	13
it	13
runs,	13
with	13
that	13
it	13
moves	13
slowly;	13
some	13
it	13
cools,	13
others	13
it	13
burns;	13
some	13
it	13
wounds,	13
others	13
it	13
slays;	13
it	13
begins	13
the	13
course	13
of	13
its	13
desires,	13
and	13
at	13
the	13
same	13
moment	13
completes	13
and	13
ends	13
it;	13
in	13
the	13
morning	13
it	13
will	13
lay	13
siege	13
to	13
a	13
fortress	13
and	13
by	13
night	13
will	13
have	13
taken	13
it,	13
for	13
there	13
is	13
no	13
power	13
that	13
can	13
resist	13
it;	13
so	13
what	13
are	13
you	13
in	13
dread	13
of,	13
what	13
do	13
you	13
fear,	13
when	13
the	13
same	13
must	13
have	13
befallen	13
Lothario,	13
love	13
having	13
chosen	13
the	13
absence	13
of	13
my	13
lord	13
as	13
the	13
instrument	13
for	13
subduing	13
you?	13
and	13
it	13
was	13
absolutely	13
necessary	13
to	13
complete	13
then	13
what	13
love	13
had	13
resolved	13
upon,	13
without	13
affording	13
the	13
time	13
to	13
let	13
Anselmo	13
return	13
and	13
by	13
his	13
presence	13
compel	13
the	13
work	13
to	13
be	13
left	13
unfinished;	13
for	13
love	13
has	13
no	13
better	13
agent	13
for	13
carrying	13
out	13
his	13
designs	13
than	13
opportunity;	13
and	13
of	13
opportunity	13
he	13
avails	13
himself	13
in	13
all	13
his	13
feats,	13
especially	13
at	13
the	13
outset.	13
All	13
this	13
I	13
know	13
well	13
myself,	13
more	13
by	13
experience	13
than	13
by	13
hearsay,	13
and	13
some	13
day,	13
señora,	13
I	13
will	13
enlighten	13
you	13
on	13
the	13
subject,	13
for	13
I	13
am	13
of	13
your	13
flesh	13
and	13
blood	13
too.	13
Moreover,	13
lady	13
Camilla,	13
you	13
did	13
not	13
surrender	13
yourself	13
or	13
yield	13
so	13
quickly	13
but	13
that	13
first	13
you	13
saw	13
Lothario’s	13
whole	13
soul	13
in	13
his	13
eyes,	13
in	13
his	13
sighs,	13
in	13
his	13
words,	13
his	13
promises	13
and	13
his	13
gifts,	13
and	13
by	13
it	13
and	13
his	13
good	13
qualities	13
perceived	13
how	13
worthy	13
he	13
was	13
of	13
your	13
love.	13
This,	13
then,	13
being	13
the	13
case,	13
let	13
not	13
these	13
scrupulous	13
and	13
prudish	13
ideas	13
trouble	13
your	13
imagination,	13
but	13
be	13
assured	13
that	13
Lothario	13
prizes	13
you	13
as	13
you	13
do	13
him,	13
and	13
rest	13
content	13
and	13
satisfied	13
that	13
as	13
you	13
are	13
caught	13
in	13
the	13
noose	13
of	13
love	13
it	13
is	13
one	13
of	13
worth	13
and	13
merit	13
that	13
has	13
taken	13
you,	13
and	13
one	13
that	13
has	13
not	13
only	13
the	13
four	13
S’s	13
that	13
they	13
say	13
true	13
lovers	13
ought	13
to	13
have,	13
but	13
a	13
complete	13
alphabet;	13
only	13
listen	13
to	13
me	13
and	13
you	13
will	13
see	13
how	13
I	13
can	13
repeat	13
it	13
by	13
rote.	13
He	13
is	13
to	13
my	13
eyes	13
and	13
thinking,	13
Amiable,	13
Brave,	13
Courteous,	13
Distinguished,	13
Elegant,	13
Fond,	13
Gay,	13
Honourable,	13
Illustrious,	13
Loyal,	13
Manly,	13
Noble,	13
Open,	13
Polite,	13
Quickwitted,	13
Rich,	13
and	13
the	13
S’s	13
according	13
to	13
the	13
saying,	13
and	13
then	13
Tender,	13
Veracious:	13
X	13
does	13
not	13
suit	13
him,	13
for	13
it	13
is	13
a	13
rough	13
letter;	13
Y	13
has	13
been	13
given	13
already;	13
and	13
Z	13
Zealous	13
for	13
your	13
honour.”	13
Camilla	13
laughed	13
at	13
her	13
maid’s	13
alphabet,	13
and	13
perceived	13
her	13
to	13
be	13
more	13
experienced	13
in	13
love	13
affairs	13
than	13
she	13
said,	13
which	13
she	13
admitted,	13
confessing	13
to	13
Camilla	13
that	13
she	13
had	13
love	13
passages	13
with	13
a	13
young	13
man	13
of	13
good	13
birth	13
of	13
the	13
same	13
city.	13
Camilla	13
was	13
uneasy	13
at	13
this,	13
dreading	13
lest	13
it	13
might	13
prove	13
the	13
means	13
of	13
endangering	13
her	13
honour,	13
and	13
asked	13
whether	13
her	13
intrigue	13
had	13
gone	13
beyond	13
words,	13
and	13
she	13
with	13
little	13
shame	13
and	13
much	13
effrontery	13
said	13
it	13
had;	13
for	13
certain	13
it	13
is	13
that	13
ladies’	13
imprudences	13
make	13
servants	13
shameless,	13
who,	13
when	13
they	13
see	13
their	13
mistresses	13
make	13
a	13
false	13
step,	13
think	13
nothing	13
of	13
going	13
astray	13
themselves,	13
or	13
of	13
its	13
being	13
known.	13
All	13
that	13
Camilla	13
could	13
do	13
was	13
to	13
entreat	13
Leonela	13
to	13
say	13
nothing	13
about	13
her	13
doings	13
to	13
him	13
whom	13
she	13
called	13
her	13
lover,	13
and	13
to	13
conduct	13
her	13
own	13
affairs	13
secretly	13
lest	13
they	13
should	13
come	13
to	13
the	13
knowledge	13
of	13
Anselmo	13
or	13
of	13
Lothario.	13
Leonela	13
said	13
she	13
would,	13
but	13
kept	13
her	13
word	13
in	13
such	13
a	13
way	13
that	13
she	13
confirmed	13
Camilla’s	13
apprehension	13
of	13
losing	13
her	13
reputation	13
through	13
her	13
means;	13
for	13
this	13
abandoned	13
and	13
bold	13
Leonela,	13
as	13
soon	13
as	13
she	13
perceived	13
that	13
her	13
mistress’s	13
demeanour	13
was	13
not	13
what	13
it	13
was	13
wont	13
to	13
be,	13
had	13
the	13
audacity	13
to	13
introduce	13
her	13
lover	13
into	13
the	13
house,	13
confident	13
that	13
even	13
if	13
her	13
mistress	13
saw	13
him	13
she	13
would	13
not	13
dare	13
to	13
expose	13
him;	13
for	13
the	13
sins	13
of	13
mistresses	13
entail	13
this	13
mischief	13
among	13
others;	13
they	13
make	13
themselves	13
the	13
slaves	13
of	13
their	13
own	13
servants,	13
and	13
are	13
obliged	13
to	13
hide	13
their	13
laxities	13
and	13
depravities;	13
as	13
was	13
the	13
case	13
with	13
Camilla,	13
who	13
though	13
she	13
perceived,	13
not	13
once	13
but	13
many	13
times,	13
that	13
Leonela	13
was	13
with	13
her	13
lover	13
in	13
some	13
room	13
of	13
the	13
house,	13
not	13
only	13
did	13
not	13
dare	13
to	13
chide	13
her,	13
but	13
afforded	13
her	13
opportunities	13
for	13
concealing	13
him	13
and	13
removed	13
all	13
difficulties,	13
lest	13
he	13
should	13
be	13
seen	13
by	13
her	13
husband.	13
She	13
was	13
unable,	13
however,	13
to	13
prevent	13
him	13
from	13
being	13
seen	13
on	13
one	13
occasion,	13
as	13
he	13
sallied	13
forth	13
at	13
daybreak,	13
by	13
Lothario,	13
who,	13
not	13
knowing	13
who	13
he	13
was,	13
at	13
first	13
took	13
him	13
for	13
a	13
spectre;	13
but,	13
as	13
soon	13
as	13
he	13
saw	13
him	13
hasten	13
away,	13
muffling	13
his	13
face	13
with	13
his	13
cloak	13
and	13
concealing	13
himself	13
carefully	13
and	13
cautiously,	13
he	13
rejected	13
this	13
foolish	13
idea,	13
and	13
adopted	13
another,	13
which	13
would	13
have	13
been	13
the	13
ruin	13
of	13
all	13
had	13
not	13
Camilla	13
found	13
a	13
remedy.	13
It	13
did	13
not	13
occur	13
to	13
Lothario	13
that	13
this	13
man	13
he	13
had	13
seen	13
issuing	13
at	13
such	13
an	13
untimely	13
hour	13
from	13
Anselmo’s	13
house	13
could	13
have	13
entered	13
it	13
on	13
Leonela’s	13
account,	13
nor	13
did	13
he	13
even	13
remember	13
there	13
was	13
such	13
a	13
person	13
as	13
Leonela;	13
all	13
he	13
thought	13
was	13
that	13
as	13
Camilla	13
had	13
been	13
light	13
and	13
yielding	13
with	13
him,	13
so	13
she	13
had	13
been	13
with	13
another;	13
for	13
this	13
further	13
penalty	13
the	13
erring	13
woman’s	13
sin	13
brings	13
with	13
it,	13
that	13
her	13
honour	13
is	13
distrusted	13
even	13
by	13
him	13
to	13
whose	13
overtures	13
and	13
persuasions	13
she	13
has	13
yielded;	13
and	13
he	13
believes	13
her	13
to	13
have	13
surrendered	13
more	13
easily	13
to	13
others,	13
and	13
gives	13
implicit	13
credence	13
to	13
every	13
suspicion	13
that	13
comes	13
into	13
his	13
mind.	13
All	13
Lothario’s	13
good	13
sense	13
seems	13
to	13
have	13
failed	13
him	13
at	13
this	13
juncture;	13
all	13
his	13
prudent	13
maxims	13
escaped	13
his	13
memory;	13
for	13
without	13
once	13
reflecting	13
rationally,	13
and	13
without	13
more	13
ado,	13
in	13
his	13
impatience	13
and	13
in	13
the	13
blindness	13
of	13
the	13
jealous	13
rage	13
that	13
gnawed	13
his	13
heart,	13
and	13
dying	13
to	13
revenge	13
himself	13
upon	13
Camilla,	13
who	13
had	13
done	13
him	13
no	13
wrong,	13
before	13
Anselmo	13
had	13
risen	13
he	13
hastened	13
to	13
him	13
and	13
said	13
to	13
him,	13
“Know,	13
Anselmo,	13
that	13
for	13
several	13
days	13
past	13
I	13
have	13
been	13
struggling	13
with	13
myself,	13
striving	13
to	13
withhold	13
from	13
thee	13
what	13
it	13
is	13
no	13
longer	13
possible	13
or	13
right	13
that	13
I	13
should	13
conceal	13
from	13
thee.	13
Know	13
that	13
Camilla’s	13
fortress	13
has	13
surrendered	13
and	13
is	13
ready	13
to	13
submit	13
to	13
my	13
will;	13
and	13
if	13
I	13
have	13
been	13
slow	13
to	13
reveal	13
this	13
fact	13
to	13
thee,	13
it	13
was	13
in	13
order	13
to	13
see	13
if	13
it	13
were	13
some	13
light	13
caprice	13
of	13
hers,	13
or	13
if	13
she	13
sought	13
to	13
try	13
me	13
and	13
ascertain	13
if	13
the	13
love	13
I	13
began	13
to	13
make	13
to	13
her	13
with	13
thy	13
permission	13
was	13
made	13
with	13
a	13
serious	13
intention.	13
I	13
thought,	13
too,	13
that	13
she,	13
if	13
she	13
were	13
what	13
she	13
ought	13
to	13
be,	13
and	13
what	13
we	13
both	13
believed	13
her,	13
would	13
have	13
ere	13
this	13
given	13
thee	13
information	13
of	13
my	13
addresses;	13
but	13
seeing	13
that	13
she	13
delays,	13
I	13
believe	13
the	13
truth	13
of	13
the	13
promise	13
she	13
has	13
given	13
me	13
that	13
the	13
next	13
time	13
thou	13
art	13
absent	13
from	13
the	13
house	13
she	13
will	13
grant	13
me	13
an	13
interview	13
in	13
the	13
closet	13
where	13
thy	13
jewels	13
are	13
kept	13
(and	13
it	13
was	13
true	13
that	13
Camilla	13
used	13
to	13
meet	13
him	13
there);	13
but	13
I	13
do	13
not	13
wish	13
thee	13
to	13
rush	13
precipitately	13
to	13
take	13
vengeance,	13
for	13
the	13
sin	13
is	13
as	13
yet	13
only	13
committed	13
in	13
intention,	13
and	13
Camilla’s	13
may	13
change	13
perhaps	13
between	13
this	13
and	13
the	13
appointed	13
time,	13
and	13
repentance	13
spring	13
up	13
in	13
its	13
place.	13
As	13
hitherto	13
thou	13
hast	13
always	13
followed	13
my	13
advice	13
wholly	13
or	13
in	13
part,	13
follow	13
and	13
observe	13
this	13
that	13
I	13
will	13
give	13
thee	13
now,	13
so	13
that,	13
without	13
mistake,	13
and	13
with	13
mature	13
deliberation,	13
thou	13
mayest	13
satisfy	13
thyself	13
as	13
to	13
what	13
may	13
seem	13
the	13
best	13
course;	13
pretend	13
to	13
absent	13
thyself	13
for	13
two	13
or	13
three	13
days	13
as	13
thou	13
hast	13
been	13
wont	13
to	13
do	13
on	13
other	13
occasions,	13
and	13
contrive	13
to	13
hide	13
thyself	13
in	13
the	13
closet;	13
for	13
the	13
tapestries	13
and	13
other	13
things	13
there	13
afford	13
great	13
facilities	13
for	13
thy	13
concealment,	13
and	13
then	13
thou	13
wilt	13
see	13
with	13
thine	13
own	13
eyes	13
and	13
I	13
with	13
mine	13
what	13
Camilla’s	13
purpose	13
may	13
be.	13
And	13
if	13
it	13
be	13
a	13
guilty	13
one,	13
which	13
may	13
be	13
feared	13
rather	13
than	13
expected,	13
with	13
silence,	13
prudence,	13
and	13
discretion	13
thou	13
canst	13
thyself	13
become	13
the	13
instrument	13
of	13
punishment	13
for	13
the	13
wrong	13
done	13
thee.”	13
Anselmo	13
was	13
amazed,	13
overwhelmed,	13
and	13
astounded	13
at	13
the	13
words	13
of	13
Lothario,	13
which	13
came	13
upon	13
him	13
at	13
a	13
time	13
when	13
he	13
least	13
expected	13
to	13
hear	13
them,	13
for	13
he	13
now	13
looked	13
upon	13
Camilla	13
as	13
having	13
triumphed	13
over	13
the	13
pretended	13
attacks	13
of	13
Lothario,	13
and	13
was	13
beginning	13
to	13
enjoy	13
the	13
glory	13
of	13
her	13
victory.	13
He	13
remained	13
silent	13
for	13
a	13
considerable	13
time,	13
looking	13
on	13
the	13
ground	13
with	13
fixed	13
gaze,	13
and	13
at	13
length	13
said,	13
“Thou	13
hast	13
behaved,	13
Lothario,	13
as	13
I	13
expected	13
of	13
thy	13
friendship:	13
I	13
will	13
follow	13
thy	13
advice	13
in	13
everything;	13
do	13
as	13
thou	13
wilt,	13
and	13
keep	13
this	13
secret	13
as	13
thou	13
seest	13
it	13
should	13
be	13
kept	13
in	13
circumstances	13
so	13
unlooked	13
for.”	13
Lothario	13
gave	13
him	13
his	13
word,	13
but	13
after	13
leaving	13
him	13
he	13
repented	13
altogether	13
of	13
what	13
he	13
had	13
said	13
to	13
him,	13
perceiving	13
how	13
foolishly	13
he	13
had	13
acted,	13
as	13
he	13
might	13
have	13
revenged	13
himself	13
upon	13
Camilla	13
in	13
some	13
less	13
cruel	13
and	13
degrading	13
way.	13
He	13
cursed	13
his	13
want	13
of	13
sense,	13
condemned	13
his	13
hasty	13
resolution,	13
and	13
knew	13
not	13
what	13
course	13
to	13
take	13
to	13
undo	13
the	13
mischief	13
or	13
find	13
some	13
ready	13
escape	13
from	13
it.	13
At	13
last	13
he	13
decided	13
upon	13
revealing	13
all	13
to	13
Camilla,	13
and,	13
as	13
there	13
was	13
no	13
want	13
of	13
opportunity	13
for	13
doing	13
so,	13
he	13
found	13
her	13
alone	13
the	13
same	13
day;	13
but	13
she,	13
as	13
soon	13
as	13
she	13
had	13
the	13
chance	13
of	13
speaking	13
to	13
him,	13
said,	13
“Lothario	13
my	13
friend,	13
I	13
must	13
tell	13
thee	13
I	13
have	13
a	13
sorrow	13
in	13
my	13
heart	13
which	13
fills	13
it	13
so	13
that	13
it	13
seems	13
ready	13
to	13
burst;	13
and	13
it	13
will	13
be	13
a	13
wonder	13
if	13
it	13
does	13
not;	13
for	13
the	13
audacity	13
of	13
Leonela	13
has	13
now	13
reached	13
such	13
a	13
pitch	13
that	13
every	13
night	13
she	13
conceals	13
a	13
gallant	13
of	13
hers	13
in	13
this	13
house	13
and	13
remains	13
with	13
him	13
till	13
morning,	13
at	13
the	13
expense	13
of	13
my	13
reputation;	13
inasmuch	13
as	13
it	13
is	13
open	13
to	13
anyone	13
to	13
question	13
it	13
who	13
may	13
see	13
him	13
quitting	13
my	13
house	13
at	13
such	13
unseasonable	13
hours;	13
but	13
what	13
distresses	13
me	13
is	13
that	13
I	13
cannot	13
punish	13
or	13
chide	13
her,	13
for	13
her	13
privity	13
to	13
our	13
intrigue	13
bridles	13
my	13
mouth	13
and	13
keeps	13
me	13
silent	13
about	13
hers,	13
while	13
I	13
am	13
dreading	13
that	13
some	13
catastrophe	13
will	13
come	13
of	13
it.”	13
As	13
Camilla	13
said	13
this	13
Lothario	13
at	13
first	13
imagined	13
it	13
was	13
some	13
device	13
to	13
delude	13
him	13
into	13
the	13
idea	13
that	13
the	13
man	13
he	13
had	13
seen	13
going	13
out	13
was	13
Leonela’s	13
lover	13
and	13
not	13
hers;	13
but	13
when	13
he	13
saw	13
how	13
she	13
wept	13
and	13
suffered,	13
and	13
begged	13
him	13
to	13
help	13
her,	13
he	13
became	13
convinced	13
of	13
the	13
truth,	13
and	13
the	13
conviction	13
completed	13
his	13
confusion	13
and	13
remorse;	13
however,	13
he	13
told	13
Camilla	13
not	13
to	13
distress	13
herself,	13
as	13
he	13
would	13
take	13
measures	13
to	13
put	13
a	13
stop	13
to	13
the	13
insolence	13
of	13
Leonela.	13
At	13
the	13
same	13
time	13
he	13
told	13
her	13
what,	13
driven	13
by	13
the	13
fierce	13
rage	13
of	13
jealousy,	13
he	13
had	13
said	13
to	13
Anselmo,	13
and	13
how	13
he	13
had	13
arranged	13
to	13
hide	13
himself	13
in	13
the	13
closet	13
that	13
he	13
might	13
there	13
see	13
plainly	13
how	13
little	13
she	13
preserved	13
her	13
fidelity	13
to	13
him;	13
and	13
he	13
entreated	13
her	13
pardon	13
for	13
this	13
madness,	13
and	13
her	13
advice	13
as	13
to	13
how	13
to	13
repair	13
it,	13
and	13
escape	13
safely	13
from	13
the	13
intricate	13
labyrinth	13
in	13
which	13
his	13
imprudence	13
had	13
involved	13
him.	13
Camilla	13
was	13
struck	13
with	13
alarm	13
at	13
hearing	13
what	13
Lothario	13
said,	13
and	13
with	13
much	13
anger,	13
and	13
great	13
good	13
sense,	13
she	13
reproved	13
him	13
and	13
rebuked	13
his	13
base	13
design	13
and	13
the	13
foolish	13
and	13
mischievous	13
resolution	13
he	13
had	13
made;	13
but	13
as	13
woman	13
has	13
by	13
nature	13
a	13
nimbler	13
wit	13
than	13
man	13
for	13
good	13
and	13
for	13
evil,	13
though	13
it	13
is	13
apt	13
to	13
fail	13
when	13
she	13
sets	13
herself	13
deliberately	13
to	13
reason,	13
Camilla	13
on	13
the	13
spur	13
of	13
the	13
moment	13
thought	13
of	13
a	13
way	13
to	13
remedy	13
what	13
was	13
to	13
all	13
appearance	13
irremediable,	13
and	13
told	13
Lothario	13
to	13
contrive	13
that	13
the	13
next	13
day	13
Anselmo	13
should	13
conceal	13
himself	13
in	13
the	13
place	13
he	13
mentioned,	13
for	13
she	13
hoped	13
from	13
his	13
concealment	13
to	13
obtain	13
the	13
means	13
of	13
their	13
enjoying	13
themselves	13
for	13
the	13
future	13
without	13
any	13
apprehension;	13
and	13
without	13
revealing	13
her	13
purpose	13
to	13
him	13
entirely	13
she	13
charged	13
him	13
to	13
be	13
careful,	13
as	13
soon	13
as	13
Anselmo	13
was	13
concealed,	13
to	13
come	13
to	13
her	13
when	13
Leonela	13
should	13
call	13
him,	13
and	13
to	13
all	13
she	13
said	13
to	13
him	13
to	13
answer	13
as	13
he	13
would	13
have	13
answered	13
had	13
he	13
not	13
known	13
that	13
Anselmo	13
was	13
listening.	13
Lothario	13
pressed	13
her	13
to	13
explain	13
her	13
intention	13
fully,	13
so	13
that	13
he	13
might	13
with	13
more	13
certainty	13
and	13
precaution	13
take	13
care	13
to	13
do	13
what	13
he	13
saw	13
to	13
be	13
needful.	13
“I	13
tell	13
you,”	13
said	13
Camilla,	13
“there	13
is	13
nothing	13
to	13
take	13
care	13
of	13
except	13
to	13
answer	13
me	13
what	13
I	13
shall	13
ask	13
you;”	13
for	13
she	13
did	13
not	13
wish	13
to	13
explain	13
to	13
him	13
beforehand	13
what	13
she	13
meant	13
to	13
do,	13
fearing	13
lest	13
he	13
should	13
be	13
unwilling	13
to	13
follow	13
out	13
an	13
idea	13
which	13
seemed	13
to	13
her	13
such	13
a	13
good	13
one,	13
and	13
should	13
try	13
or	13
devise	13
some	13
other	13
less	13
practicable	13
plan.	13
Lothario	13
then	13
retired,	13
and	13
the	13
next	13
day	13
Anselmo,	13
under	13
pretence	13
of	13
going	13
to	13
his	13
friend’s	13
country	13
house,	13
took	13
his	13
departure,	13
and	13
then	13
returned	13
to	13
conceal	13
himself,	13
which	13
he	13
was	13
able	13
to	13
do	13
easily,	13
as	13
Camilla	13
and	13
Leonela	13
took	13
care	13
to	13
give	13
him	13
the	13
opportunity;	13
and	13
so	13
he	13
placed	13
himself	13
in	13
hiding	13
in	13
the	13
state	13
of	13
agitation	13
that	13
it	13
may	13
be	13
imagined	13
he	13
would	13
feel	13
who	13
expected	13
to	13
see	13
the	13
vitals	13
of	13
his	13
honour	13
laid	13
bare	13
before	13
his	13
eyes,	13
and	13
found	13
himself	13
on	13
the	13
point	13
of	13
losing	13
the	13
supreme	13
blessing	13
he	13
thought	13
he	13
possessed	13
in	13
his	13
beloved	13
Camilla.	13
Having	13
made	13
sure	13
of	13
Anselmo’s	13
being	13
in	13
his	13
hiding-place,	13
Camilla	13
and	13
Leonela	13
entered	13
the	13
closet,	13
and	13
the	13
instant	13
she	13
set	13
foot	13
within	13
it	13
Camilla	13
said,	13
with	13
a	13
deep	13
sigh,	13
“Ah!	13
dear	13
Leonela,	13
would	13
it	13
not	13
be	13
better,	13
before	13
I	13
do	13
what	13
I	13
am	13
unwilling	13
you	13
should	13
know	13
lest	13
you	13
should	13
seek	13
to	13
prevent	13
it,	13
that	13
you	13
should	13
take	13
Anselmo’s	13
dagger	13
that	13
I	13
have	13
asked	13
of	13
you	13
and	13
with	13
it	13
pierce	13
this	13
vile	13
heart	13
of	13
mine?	13
But	13
no;	13
there	13
is	13
no	13
reason	13
why	13
I	13
should	13
suffer	13
the	13
punishment	13
of	13
another’s	13
fault.	13
I	13
will	13
first	13
know	13
what	13
it	13
is	13
that	13
the	13
bold	13
licentious	13
eyes	13
of	13
Lothario	13
have	13
seen	13
in	13
me	13
that	13
could	13
have	13
encouraged	13
him	13
to	13
reveal	13
to	13
me	13
a	13
design	13
so	13
base	13
as	13
that	13
which	13
he	13
has	13
disclosed	13
regardless	13
of	13
his	13
friend	13
and	13
of	13
my	13
honour.	13
Go	13
to	13
the	13
window,	13
Leonela,	13
and	13
call	13
him,	13
for	13
no	13
doubt	13
he	13
is	13
in	13
the	13
street	13
waiting	13
to	13
carry	13
out	13
his	13
vile	13
project;	13
but	13
mine,	13
cruel	13
it	13
may	13
be,	13
but	13
honourable,	13
shall	13
be	13
carried	13
out	13
first.”	13
“Ah,	13
señora,”	13
said	13
the	13
crafty	13
Leonela,	13
who	13
knew	13
her	13
part,	13
“what	13
is	13
it	13
you	13
want	13
to	13
do	13
with	13
this	13
dagger?	13
Can	13
it	13
be	13
that	13
you	13
mean	13
to	13
take	13
your	13
own	13
life,	13
or	13
Lothario’s?	13
for	13
whichever	13
you	13
mean	13
to	13
do,	13
it	13
will	13
lead	13
to	13
the	13
loss	13
of	13
your	13
reputation	13
and	13
good	13
name.	13
It	13
is	13
better	13
to	13
dissemble	13
your	13
wrong	13
and	13
not	13
give	13
this	13
wicked	13
man	13
the	13
chance	13
of	13
entering	13
the	13
house	13
now	13
and	13
finding	13
us	13
alone;	13
consider,	13
señora,	13
we	13
are	13
weak	13
women	13
and	13
he	13
is	13
a	13
man,	13
and	13
determined,	13
and	13
as	13
he	13
comes	13
with	13
such	13
a	13
base	13
purpose,	13
blind	13
and	13
urged	13
by	13
passion,	13
perhaps	13
before	13
you	13
can	13
put	13
yours	13
into	13
execution	13
he	13
may	13
do	13
what	13
will	13
be	13
worse	13
for	13
you	13
than	13
taking	13
your	13
life.	13
Ill	13
betide	13
my	13
master,	13
Anselmo,	13
for	13
giving	13
such	13
authority	13
in	13
his	13
house	13
to	13
this	13
shameless	13
fellow!	13
And	13
supposing	13
you	13
kill	13
him,	13
señora,	13
as	13
I	13
suspect	13
you	13
mean	13
to	13
do,	13
what	13
shall	13
we	13
do	13
with	13
him	13
when	13
he	13
is	13
dead?”	13
“What,	13
my	13
friend?”	13
replied	13
Camilla,	13
“we	13
shall	13
leave	13
him	13
for	13
Anselmo	13
to	13
bury	13
him;	13
for	13
in	13
reason	13
it	13
will	13
be	13
to	13
him	13
a	13
light	13
labour	13
to	13
hide	13
his	13
own	13
infamy	13
under	13
ground.	13
Summon	13
him,	13
make	13
haste,	13
for	13
all	13
the	13
time	13
I	13
delay	13
in	13
taking	13
vengeance	13
for	13
my	13
wrong	13
seems	13
to	13
me	13
an	13
offence	13
against	13
the	13
loyalty	13
I	13
owe	13
my	13
husband.”	13
Anselmo	13
was	13
listening	13
to	13
all	13
this,	13
and	13
every	13
word	13
that	13
Camilla	13
uttered	13
made	13
him	13
change	13
his	13
mind;	13
but	13
when	13
he	13
heard	13
that	13
it	13
was	13
resolved	13
to	13
kill	13
Lothario	13
his	13
first	13
impulse	13
was	13
to	13
come	13
out	13
and	13
show	13
himself	13
to	13
avert	13
such	13
a	13
disaster;	13
but	13
in	13
his	13
anxiety	13
to	13
see	13
the	13
issue	13
of	13
a	13
resolution	13
so	13
bold	13
and	13
virtuous	13
he	13
restrained	13
himself,	13
intending	13
to	13
come	13
forth	13
in	13
time	13
to	13
prevent	13
the	13
deed.	13
At	13
this	13
moment	13
Camilla,	13
throwing	13
herself	13
upon	13
a	13
bed	13
that	13
was	13
close	13
by,	13
swooned	13
away,	13
and	13
Leonela	13
began	13
to	13
weep	13
bitterly,	13
exclaiming,	13
“Woe	13
is	13
me!	13
that	13
I	13
should	13
be	13
fated	13
to	13
have	13
dying	13
here	13
in	13
my	13
arms	13
the	13
flower	13
of	13
virtue	13
upon	13
earth,	13
the	13
crown	13
of	13
true	13
wives,	13
the	13
pattern	13
of	13
chastity!”	13
with	13
more	13
to	13
the	13
same	13
effect,	13
so	13
that	13
anyone	13
who	13
heard	13
her	13
would	13
have	13
taken	13
her	13
for	13
the	13
most	13
tender-hearted	13
and	13
faithful	13
handmaid	13
in	13
the	13
world,	13
and	13
her	13
mistress	13
for	13
another	13
persecuted	13
Penelope.	13
Camilla	13
was	13
not	13
long	13
in	13
recovering	13
from	13
her	13
fainting	13
fit	13
and	13
on	13
coming	13
to	13
herself	13
she	13
said,	13
“Why	13
do	13
you	13
not	13
go,	13
Leonela,	13
to	13
call	13
hither	13
that	13
friend,	13
the	13
falsest	13
to	13
his	13
friend	13
the	13
sun	13
ever	13
shone	13
upon	13
or	13
night	13
concealed?	13
Away,	13
run,	13
haste,	13
speed!	13
lest	13
the	13
fire	13
of	13
my	13
wrath	13
burn	13
itself	13
out	13
with	13
delay,	13
and	13
the	13
righteous	13
vengeance	13
that	13
I	13
hope	13
for	13
melt	13
away	13
in	13
menaces	13
and	13
maledictions.”	13
“I	13
am	13
just	13
going	13
to	13
call	13
him,	13
señora,”	13
said	13
Leonela;	13
“but	13
you	13
must	13
first	13
give	13
me	13
that	13
dagger,	13
lest	13
while	13
I	13
am	13
gone	13
you	13
should	13
by	13
means	13
of	13
it	13
give	13
cause	13
to	13
all	13
who	13
love	13
you	13
to	13
weep	13
all	13
their	13
lives.”	13
“Go	13
in	13
peace,	13
dear	13
Leonela,	13
I	13
will	13
not	13
do	13
so,”	13
said	13
Camilla,	13
“for	13
rash	13
and	13
foolish	13
as	13
I	13
may	13
be,	13
to	13
your	13
mind,	13
in	13
defending	13
my	13
honour,	13
I	13
am	13
not	13
going	13
to	13
be	13
so	13
much	13
so	13
as	13
that	13
Lucretia	13
who	13
they	13
say	13
killed	13
herself	13
without	13
having	13
done	13
anything	13
wrong,	13
and	13
without	13
having	13
first	13
killed	13
him	13
on	13
whom	13
the	13
guilt	13
of	13
her	13
misfortune	13
lay.	13
I	13
shall	13
die,	13
if	13
I	13
am	13
to	13
die;	13
but	13
it	13
must	13
be	13
after	13
full	13
vengeance	13
upon	13
him	13
who	13
has	13
brought	13
me	13
here	13
to	13
weep	13
over	13
audacity	13
that	13
no	13
fault	13
of	13
mine	13
gave	13
birth	13
to.”	13
Leonela	13
required	13
much	13
pressing	13
before	13
she	13
would	13
go	13
to	13
summon	13
Lothario,	13
but	13
at	13
last	13
she	13
went,	13
and	13
while	13
awaiting	13
her	13
return	13
Camilla	13
continued,	13
as	13
if	13
speaking	13
to	13
herself,	13
“Good	13
God!	13
would	13
it	13
not	13
have	13
been	13
more	13
prudent	13
to	13
have	13
repulsed	13
Lothario,	13
as	13
I	13
have	13
done	13
many	13
a	13
time	13
before,	13
than	13
to	13
allow	13
him,	13
as	13
I	13
am	13
now	13
doing,	13
to	13
think	13
me	13
unchaste	13
and	13
vile,	13
even	13
for	13
the	13
short	13
time	13
I	13
must	13
wait	13
until	13
I	13
undeceive	13
him?	13
No	13
doubt	13
it	13
would	13
have	13
been	13
better;	13
but	13
I	13
should	13
not	13
be	13
avenged,	13
nor	13
the	13
honour	13
of	13
my	13
husband	13
vindicated,	13
should	13
he	13
find	13
so	13
clear	13
and	13
easy	13
an	13
escape	13
from	13
the	13
strait	13
into	13
which	13
his	13
depravity	13
has	13
led	13
him.	13
Let	13
the	13
traitor	13
pay	13
with	13
his	13
life	13
for	13
the	13
temerity	13
of	13
his	13
wanton	13
wishes,	13
and	13
let	13
the	13
world	13
know	13
(if	13
haply	13
it	13
shall	13
ever	13
come	13
to	13
know)	13
that	13
Camilla	13
not	13
only	13
preserved	13
her	13
allegiance	13
to	13
her	13
husband,	13
but	13
avenged	13
him	13
of	13
the	13
man	13
who	13
dared	13
to	13
wrong	13
him.	13
Still,	13
I	13
think	13
it	13
might	13
be	13
better	13
to	13
disclose	13
this	13
to	13
Anselmo.	13
But	13
then	13
I	13
have	13
called	13
his	13
attention	13
to	13
it	13
in	13
the	13
letter	13
I	13
wrote	13
to	13
him	13
in	13
the	13
country,	13
and,	13
if	13
he	13
did	13
nothing	13
to	13
prevent	13
the	13
mischief	13
I	13
there	13
pointed	13
out	13
to	13
him,	13
I	13
suppose	13
it	13
was	13
that	13
from	13
pure	13
goodness	13
of	13
heart	13
and	13
trustfulness	13
he	13
would	13
not	13
and	13
could	13
not	13
believe	13
that	13
any	13
thought	13
against	13
his	13
honour	13
could	13
harbour	13
in	13
the	13
breast	13
of	13
so	13
stanch	13
a	13
friend;	13
nor	13
indeed	13
did	13
I	13
myself	13
believe	13
it	13
for	13
many	13
days,	13
nor	13
should	13
I	13
have	13
ever	13
believed	13
it	13
if	13
his	13
insolence	13
had	13
not	13
gone	13
so	13
far	13
as	13
to	13
make	13
it	13
manifest	13
by	13
open	13
presents,	13
lavish	13
promises,	13
and	13
ceaseless	13
tears.	13
But	13
why	13
do	13
I	13
argue	13
thus?	13
Does	13
a	13
bold	13
determination	13
stand	13
in	13
need	13
of	13
arguments?	13
Surely	13
not.	13
Then	13
traitors	13
avaunt!	13
Vengeance	13
to	13
my	13
aid!	13
Let	13
the	13
false	13
one	13
come,	13
approach,	13
advance,	13
die,	13
yield	13
up	13
his	13
life,	13
and	13
then	13
befall	13
what	13
may.	13
Pure	13
I	13
came	13
to	13
him	13
whom	13
Heaven	13
bestowed	13
upon	13
me,	13
pure	13
I	13
shall	13
leave	13
him;	13
and	13
at	13
the	13
worst	13
bathed	13
in	13
my	13
own	13
chaste	13
blood	13
and	13
in	13
the	13
foul	13
blood	13
of	13
the	13
falsest	13
friend	13
that	13
friendship	13
ever	13
saw	13
in	13
the	13
world;”	13
and	13
as	13
she	13
uttered	13
these	13
words	13
she	13
paced	13
the	13
room	13
holding	13
the	13
unsheathed	13
dagger,	13
with	13
such	13
irregular	13
and	13
disordered	13
steps,	13
and	13
such	13
gestures	13
that	13
one	13
would	13
have	13
supposed	13
her	13
to	13
have	13
lost	13
her	13
senses,	13
and	13
taken	13
her	13
for	13
some	13
violent	13
desperado	13
instead	13
of	13
a	13
delicate	13
woman.	13
Anselmo,	13
hidden	13
behind	13
some	13
tapestries	13
where	13
he	13
had	13
concealed	13
himself,	13
beheld	13
and	13
was	13
amazed	13
at	13
all,	13
and	13
already	13
felt	13
that	13
what	13
he	13
had	13
seen	13
and	13
heard	13
was	13
a	13
sufficient	13
answer	13
to	13
even	13
greater	13
suspicions;	13
and	13
he	13
would	13
have	13
been	13
now	13
well	13
pleased	13
if	13
the	13
proof	13
afforded	13
by	13
Lothario’s	13
coming	13
were	13
dispensed	13
with,	13
as	13
he	13
feared	13
some	13
sudden	13
mishap;	13
but	13
as	13
he	13
was	13
on	13
the	13
point	13
of	13
showing	13
himself	13
and	13
coming	13
forth	13
to	13
embrace	13
and	13
undeceive	13
his	13
wife	13
he	13
paused	13
as	13
he	13
saw	13
Leonela	13
returning,	13
leading	13
Lothario.	13
Camilla	13
when	13
she	13
saw	13
him,	13
drawing	13
a	13
long	13
line	13
in	13
front	13
of	13
her	13
on	13
the	13
floor	13
with	13
the	13
dagger,	13
said	13
to	13
him,	13
“Lothario,	13
pay	13
attention	13
to	13
what	13
I	13
say	13
to	13
thee:	13
if	13
by	13
any	13
chance	13
thou	13
darest	13
to	13
cross	13
this	13
line	13
thou	13
seest,	13
or	13
even	13
approach	13
it,	13
the	13
instant	13
I	13
see	13
thee	13
attempt	13
it	13
that	13
same	13
instant	13
will	13
I	13
pierce	13
my	13
bosom	13
with	13
this	13
dagger	13
that	13
I	13
hold	13
in	13
my	13
hand;	13
and	13
before	13
thou	13
answerest	13
me	13
a	13
word	13
desire	13
thee	13
to	13
listen	13
to	13
a	13
few	13
from	13
me,	13
and	13
afterwards	13
thou	13
shalt	13
reply	13
as	13
may	13
please	13
thee.	13
First,	13
I	13
desire	13
thee	13
to	13
tell	13
me,	13
Lothario,	13
if	13
thou	13
knowest	13
my	13
husband	13
Anselmo,	13
and	13
in	13
what	13
light	13
thou	13
regardest	13
him;	13
and	13
secondly	13
I	13
desire	13
to	13
know	13
if	13
thou	13
knowest	13
me	13
too.	13
Answer	13
me	13
this,	13
without	13
embarrassment	13
or	13
reflecting	13
deeply	13
what	13
thou	13
wilt	13
answer,	13
for	13
they	13
are	13
no	13
riddles	13
I	13
put	13
to	13
thee.”	13
Lothario	13
was	13
not	13
so	13
dull	13
but	13
that	13
from	13
the	13
first	13
moment	13
when	13
Camilla	13
directed	13
him	13
to	13
make	13
Anselmo	13
hide	13
himself	13
he	13
understood	13
what	13
she	13
intended	13
to	13
do,	13
and	13
therefore	13
he	13
fell	13
in	13
with	13
her	13
idea	13
so	13
readily	13
and	13
promptly	13
that	13
between	13
them	13
they	13
made	13
the	13
imposture	13
look	13
more	13
true	13
than	13
truth;	13
so	13
he	13
answered	13
her	13
thus:	13
“I	13
did	13
not	13
think,	13
fair	13
Camilla,	13
that	13
thou	13
wert	13
calling	13
me	13
to	13
ask	13
questions	13
so	13
remote	13
from	13
the	13
object	13
with	13
which	13
I	13
come;	13
but	13
if	13
it	13
is	13
to	13
defer	13
the	13
promised	13
reward	13
thou	13
art	13
doing	13
so,	13
thou	13
mightst	13
have	13
put	13
it	13
off	13
still	13
longer,	13
for	13
the	13
longing	13
for	13
happiness	13
gives	13
the	13
more	13
distress	13
the	13
nearer	13
comes	13
the	13
hope	13
of	13
gaining	13
it;	13
but	13
lest	13
thou	13
shouldst	13
say	13
that	13
I	13
do	13
not	13
answer	13
thy	13
questions,	13
I	13
say	13
that	13
I	13
know	13
thy	13
husband	13
Anselmo,	13
and	13
that	13
we	13
have	13
known	13
each	13
other	13
from	13
our	13
earliest	13
years;	13
I	13
will	13
not	13
speak	13
of	13
what	13
thou	13
too	13
knowest,	13
of	13
our	13
friendship,	13
that	13
I	13
may	13
not	13
compel	13
myself	13
to	13
testify	13
against	13
the	13
wrong	13
that	13
love,	13
the	13
mighty	13
excuse	13
for	13
greater	13
errors,	13
makes	13
me	13
inflict	13
upon	13
him.	13
Thee	13
I	13
know	13
and	13
hold	13
in	13
the	13
same	13
estimation	13
as	13
he	13
does,	13
for	13
were	13
it	13
not	13
so	13
I	13
had	13
not	13
for	13
a	13
lesser	13
prize	13
acted	13
in	13
opposition	13
to	13
what	13
I	13
owe	13
to	13
my	13
station	13
and	13
the	13
holy	13
laws	13
of	13
true	13
friendship,	13
now	13
broken	13
and	13
violated	13
by	13
me	13
through	13
that	13
powerful	13
enemy,	13
love.”	13
“If	13
thou	13
dost	13
confess	13
that,”	13
returned	13
Camilla,	13
“mortal	13
enemy	13
of	13
all	13
that	13
rightly	13
deserves	13
to	13
be	13
loved,	13
with	13
what	13
face	13
dost	13
thou	13
dare	13
to	13
come	13
before	13
one	13
whom	13
thou	13
knowest	13
to	13
be	13
the	13
mirror	13
wherein	13
he	13
is	13
reflected	13
on	13
whom	13
thou	13
shouldst	13
look	13
to	13
see	13
how	13
unworthily	13
thou	13
wrongest	13
him?	13
But,	13
woe	13
is	13
me,	13
I	13
now	13
comprehend	13
what	13
has	13
made	13
thee	13
give	13
so	13
little	13
heed	13
to	13
what	13
thou	13
owest	13
to	13
thyself;	13
it	13
must	13
have	13
been	13
some	13
freedom	13
of	13
mine,	13
for	13
I	13
will	13
not	13
call	13
it	13
immodesty,	13
as	13
it	13
did	13
not	13
proceed	13
from	13
any	13
deliberate	13
intention,	13
but	13
from	13
some	13
heedlessness	13
such	13
as	13
women	13
are	13
guilty	13
of	13
through	13
inadvertence	13
when	13
they	13
think	13
they	13
have	13
no	13
occasion	13
for	13
reserve.	13
But	13
tell	13
me,	13
traitor,	13
when	13
did	13
I	13
by	13
word	13
or	13
sign	13
give	13
a	13
reply	13
to	13
thy	13
prayers	13
that	13
could	13
awaken	13
in	13
thee	13
a	13
shadow	13
of	13
hope	13
of	13
attaining	13
thy	13
base	13
wishes?	13
When	13
were	13
not	13
thy	13
professions	13
of	13
love	13
sternly	13
and	13
scornfully	13
rejected	13
and	13
rebuked?	13
When	13
were	13
thy	13
frequent	13
pledges	13
and	13
still	13
more	13
frequent	13
gifts	13
believed	13
or	13
accepted?	13
But	13
as	13
I	13
am	13
persuaded	13
that	13
no	13
one	13
can	13
long	13
persevere	13
in	13
the	13
attempt	13
to	13
win	13
love	13
unsustained	13
by	13
some	13
hope,	13
I	13
am	13
willing	13
to	13
attribute	13
to	13
myself	13
the	13
blame	13
of	13
thy	13
assurance,	13
for	13
no	13
doubt	13
some	13
thoughtlessness	13
of	13
mine	13
has	13
all	13
this	13
time	13
fostered	13
thy	13
hopes;	13
and	13
therefore	13
will	13
I	13
punish	13
myself	13
and	13
inflict	13
upon	13
myself	13
the	13
penalty	13
thy	13
guilt	13
deserves.	13
And	13
that	13
thou	13
mayest	13
see	13
that	13
being	13
so	13
relentless	13
to	13
myself	13
I	13
cannot	13
possibly	13
be	13
otherwise	13
to	13
thee,	13
I	13
have	13
summoned	13
thee	13
to	13
be	13
a	13
witness	13
of	13
the	13
sacrifice	13
I	13
mean	13
to	13
offer	13
to	13
the	13
injured	13
honour	13
of	13
my	13
honoured	13
husband,	13
wronged	13
by	13
thee	13
with	13
all	13
the	13
assiduity	13
thou	13
wert	13
capable	13
of,	13
and	13
by	13
me	13
too	13
through	13
want	13
of	13
caution	13
in	13
avoiding	13
every	13
occasion,	13
if	13
I	13
have	13
given	13
any,	13
of	13
encouraging	13
and	13
sanctioning	13
thy	13
base	13
designs.	13
Once	13
more	13
I	13
say	13
the	13
suspicion	13
in	13
my	13
mind	13
that	13
some	13
imprudence	13
of	13
mine	13
has	13
engendered	13
these	13
lawless	13
thoughts	13
in	13
thee,	13
is	13
what	13
causes	13
me	13
most	13
distress	13
and	13
what	13
I	13
desire	13
most	13
to	13
punish	13
with	13
my	13
own	13
hands,	13
for	13
were	13
any	13
other	13
instrument	13
of	13
punishment	13
employed	13
my	13
error	13
might	13
become	13
perhaps	13
more	13
widely	13
known;	13
but	13
before	13
I	13
do	13
so,	13
in	13
my	13
death	13
I	13
mean	13
to	13
inflict	13
death,	13
and	13
take	13
with	13
me	13
one	13
that	13
will	13
fully	13
satisfy	13
my	13
longing	13
for	13
the	13
revenge	13
I	13
hope	13
for	13
and	13
have;	13
for	13
I	13
shall	13
see,	13
wheresoever	13
it	13
may	13
be	13
that	13
I	13
go,	13
the	13
penalty	13
awarded	13
by	13
inflexible,	13
unswerving	13
justice	13
on	13
him	13
who	13
has	13
placed	13
me	13
in	13
a	13
position	13
so	13
desperate.”	13
As	13
she	13
uttered	13
these	13
words,	13
with	13
incredible	13
energy	13
and	13
swiftness	13
she	13
flew	13
upon	13
Lothario	13
with	13
the	13
naked	13
dagger,	13
so	13
manifestly	13
bent	13
on	13
burying	13
it	13
in	13
his	13
breast	13
that	13
he	13
was	13
almost	13
uncertain	13
whether	13
these	13
demonstrations	13
were	13
real	13
or	13
feigned,	13
for	13
he	13
was	13
obliged	13
to	13
have	13
recourse	13
to	13
all	13
his	13
skill	13
and	13
strength	13
to	13
prevent	13
her	13
from	13
striking	13
him;	13
and	13
with	13
such	13
reality	13
did	13
she	13
act	13
this	13
strange	13
farce	13
and	13
mystification	13
that,	13
to	13
give	13
it	13
a	13
colour	13
of	13
truth,	13
she	13
determined	13
to	13
stain	13
it	13
with	13
her	13
own	13
blood;	13
for	13
perceiving,	13
or	13
pretending,	13
that	13
she	13
could	13
not	13
wound	13
Lothario,	13
she	13
said,	13
“Fate,	13
it	13
seems,	13
will	13
not	13
grant	13
my	13
just	13
desire	13
complete	13
satisfaction,	13
but	13
it	13
will	13
not	13
be	13
able	13
to	13
keep	13
me	13
from	13
satisfying	13
it	13
partially	13
at	13
least;”	13
and	13
making	13
an	13
effort	13
to	13
free	13
the	13
hand	13
with	13
the	13
dagger	13
which	13
Lothario	13
held	13
in	13
his	13
grasp,	13
she	13
released	13
it,	13
and	13
directing	13
the	13
point	13
to	13
a	13
place	13
where	13
it	13
could	13
not	13
inflict	13
a	13
deep	13
wound,	13
she	13
plunged	13
it	13
into	13
her	13
left	13
side	13
high	13
up	13
close	13
to	13
the	13
shoulder,	13
and	13
then	13
allowed	13
herself	13
to	13
fall	13
to	13
the	13
ground	13
as	13
if	13
in	13
a	13
faint.	13
Leonela	13
and	13
Lothario	13
stood	13
amazed	13
and	13
astounded	13
at	13
the	13
catastrophe,	13
and	13
seeing	13
Camilla	13
stretched	13
on	13
the	13
ground	13
and	13
bathed	13
in	13
her	13
blood	13
they	13
were	13
still	13
uncertain	13
as	13
to	13
the	13
true	13
nature	13
of	13
the	13
act.	13
Lothario,	13
terrified	13
and	13
breathless,	13
ran	13
in	13
haste	13
to	13
pluck	13
out	13
the	13
dagger;	13
but	13
when	13
he	13
saw	13
how	13
slight	13
the	13
wound	13
was	13
he	13
was	13
relieved	13
of	13
his	13
fears	13
and	13
once	13
more	13
admired	13
the	13
subtlety,	13
coolness,	13
and	13
ready	13
wit	13
of	13
the	13
fair	13
Camilla;	13
and	13
the	13
better	13
to	13
support	13
the	13
part	13
he	13
had	13
to	13
play	13
he	13
began	13
to	13
utter	13
profuse	13
and	13
doleful	13
lamentations	13
over	13
her	13
body	13
as	13
if	13
she	13
were	13
dead,	13
invoking	13
maledictions	13
not	13
only	13
on	13
himself	13
but	13
also	13
on	13
him	13
who	13
had	13
been	13
the	13
means	13
of	13
placing	13
him	13
in	13
such	13
a	13
position:	13
and	13
knowing	13
that	13
his	13
friend	13
Anselmo	13
heard	13
him	13
he	13
spoke	13
in	13
such	13
a	13
way	13
as	13
to	13
make	13
a	13
listener	13
feel	13
much	13
more	13
pity	13
for	13
him	13
than	13
for	13
Camilla,	13
even	13
though	13
he	13
supposed	13
her	13
dead.	13
Leonela	13
took	13
her	13
up	13
in	13
her	13
arms	13
and	13
laid	13
her	13
on	13
the	13
bed,	13
entreating	13
Lothario	13
to	13
go	13
in	13
quest	13
of	13
someone	13
to	13
attend	13
to	13
her	13
wound	13
in	13
secret,	13
and	13
at	13
the	13
same	13
time	13
asking	13
his	13
advice	13
and	13
opinion	13
as	13
to	13
what	13
they	13
should	13
say	13
to	13
Anselmo	13
about	13
his	13
lady’s	13
wound	13
if	13
he	13
should	13
chance	13
to	13
return	13
before	13
it	13
was	13
healed.	13
He	13
replied	13
they	13
might	13
say	13
what	13
they	13
liked,	13
for	13
he	13
was	13
not	13
in	13
a	13
state	13
to	13
give	13
advice	13
that	13
would	13
be	13
of	13
any	13
use;	13
all	13
he	13
could	13
tell	13
her	13
was	13
to	13
try	13
and	13
stanch	13
the	13
blood,	13
as	13
he	13
was	13
going	13
where	13
he	13
should	13
never	13
more	13
be	13
seen;	13
and	13
with	13
every	13
appearance	13
of	13
deep	13
grief	13
and	13
sorrow	13
he	13
left	13
the	13
house;	13
but	13
when	13
he	13
found	13
himself	13
alone,	13
and	13
where	13
there	13
was	13
nobody	13
to	13
see	13
him,	13
he	13
crossed	13
himself	13
unceasingly,	13
lost	13
in	13
wonder	13
at	13
the	13
adroitness	13
of	13
Camilla	13
and	13
the	13
consistent	13
acting	13
of	13
Leonela.	13
He	13
reflected	13
how	13
convinced	13
Anselmo	13
would	13
be	13
that	13
he	13
had	13
a	13
second	13
Portia	13
for	13
a	13
wife,	13
and	13
he	13
looked	13
forward	13
anxiously	13
to	13
meeting	13
him	13
in	13
order	13
to	13
rejoice	13
together	13
over	13
falsehood	13
and	13
truth	13
the	13
most	13
craftily	13
veiled	13
that	13
could	13
be	13
imagined.	13
Leonela,	13
as	13
he	13
told	13
her,	13
stanched	13
her	13
lady’s	13
blood,	13
which	13
was	13
no	13
more	13
than	13
sufficed	13
to	13
support	13
her	13
deception;	13
and	13
washing	13
the	13
wound	13
with	13
a	13
little	13
wine	13
she	13
bound	13
it	13
up	13
to	13
the	13
best	13
of	13
her	13
skill,	13
talking	13
all	13
the	13
time	13
she	13
was	13
tending	13
her	13
in	13
a	13
strain	13
that,	13
even	13
if	13
nothing	13
else	13
had	13
been	13
said	13
before,	13
would	13
have	13
been	13
enough	13
to	13
assure	13
Anselmo	13
that	13
he	13
had	13
in	13
Camilla	13
a	13
model	13
of	13
purity.	13
To	13
Leonela’s	13
words	13
Camilla	13
added	13
her	13
own,	13
calling	13
herself	13
cowardly	13
and	13
wanting	13
in	13
spirit,	13
since	13
she	13
had	13
not	13
enough	13
at	13
the	13
time	13
she	13
had	13
most	13
need	13
of	13
it	13
to	13
rid	13
herself	13
of	13
the	13
life	13
she	13
so	13
much	13
loathed.	13
She	13
asked	13
her	13
attendant’s	13
advice	13
as	13
to	13
whether	13
or	13
not	13
she	13
ought	13
to	13
inform	13
her	13
beloved	13
husband	13
of	13
all	13
that	13
had	13
happened,	13
but	13
the	13
other	13
bade	13
her	13
say	13
nothing	13
about	13
it,	13
as	13
she	13
would	13
lay	13
upon	13
him	13
the	13
obligation	13
of	13
taking	13
vengeance	13
on	13
Lothario,	13
which	13
he	13
could	13
not	13
do	13
but	13
at	13
great	13
risk	13
to	13
himself;	13
and	13
it	13
was	13
the	13
duty	13
of	13
a	13
true	13
wife	13
not	13
to	13
give	13
her	13
husband	13
provocation	13
to	13
quarrel,	13
but,	13
on	13
the	13
contrary,	13
to	13
remove	13
it	13
as	13
far	13
as	13
possible	13
from	13
him.	13
Camilla	13
replied	13
that	13
she	13
believed	13
she	13
was	13
right	13
and	13
that	13
she	13
would	13
follow	13
her	13
advice,	13
but	13
at	13
any	13
rate	13
it	13
would	13
be	13
well	13
to	13
consider	13
how	13
she	13
was	13
to	13
explain	13
the	13
wound	13
to	13
Anselmo,	13
for	13
he	13
could	13
not	13
help	13
seeing	13
it;	13
to	13
which	13
Leonela	13
answered	13
that	13
she	13
did	13
not	13
know	13
how	13
to	13
tell	13
a	13
lie	13
even	13
in	13
jest.	13
“How	13
then	13
can	13
I	13
know,	13
my	13
dear?”	13
said	13
Camilla,	13
“for	13
I	13
should	13
not	13
dare	13
to	13
forge	13
or	13
keep	13
up	13
a	13
falsehood	13
if	13
my	13
life	13
depended	13
on	13
it.	13
If	13
we	13
can	13
think	13
of	13
no	13
escape	13
from	13
this	13
difficulty,	13
it	13
will	13
be	13
better	13
to	13
tell	13
him	13
the	13
plain	13
truth	13
than	13
that	13
he	13
should	13
find	13
us	13
out	13
in	13
an	13
untrue	13
story.”	13
“Be	13
not	13
uneasy,	13
señora,”	13
said	13
Leonela;	13
“between	13
this	13
and	13
to-morrow	13
I	13
will	13
think	13
of	13
what	13
we	13
must	13
say	13
to	13
him,	13
and	13
perhaps	13
the	13
wound	13
being	13
where	13
it	13
is	13
it	13
can	13
be	13
hidden	13
from	13
his	13
sight,	13
and	13
Heaven	13
will	13
be	13
pleased	13
to	13
aid	13
us	13
in	13
a	13
purpose	13
so	13
good	13
and	13
honourable.	13
Compose	13
yourself,	13
señora,	13
and	13
endeavour	13
to	13
calm	13
your	13
excitement	13
lest	13
my	13
lord	13
find	13
you	13
agitated;	13
and	13
leave	13
the	13
rest	13
to	13
my	13
care	13
and	13
God’s,	13
who	13
always	13
supports	13
good	13
intentions.”	13
Anselmo	13
had	13
with	13
the	13
deepest	13
attention	13
listened	13
to	13
and	13
seen	13
played	13
out	13
the	13
tragedy	13
of	13
the	13
death	13
of	13
his	13
honour,	13
which	13
the	13
performers	13
acted	13
with	13
such	13
wonderfully	13
effective	13
truth	13
that	13
it	13
seemed	13
as	13
if	13
they	13
had	13
become	13
the	13
realities	13
of	13
the	13
parts	13
they	13
played.	13
He	13
longed	13
for	13
night	13
and	13
an	13
opportunity	13
of	13
escaping	13
from	13
the	13
house	13
to	13
go	13
and	13
see	13
his	13
good	13
friend	13
Lothario,	13
and	13
with	13
him	13
give	13
vent	13
to	13
his	13
joy	13
over	13
the	13
precious	13
pearl	13
he	13
had	13
gained	13
in	13
having	13
established	13
his	13
wife’s	13
purity.	13
Both	13
mistress	13
and	13
maid	13
took	13
care	13
to	13
give	13
him	13
time	13
and	13
opportunity	13
to	13
get	13
away,	13
and	13
taking	13
advantage	13
of	13
it	13
he	13
made	13
his	13
escape,	13
and	13
at	13
once	13
went	13
in	13
quest	13
of	13
Lothario,	13
and	13
it	13
would	13
be	13
impossible	13
to	13
describe	13
how	13
he	13
embraced	13
him	13
when	13
he	13
found	13
him,	13
and	13
the	13
things	13
he	13
said	13
to	13
him	13
in	13
the	13
joy	13
of	13
his	13
heart,	13
and	13
the	13
praises	13
he	13
bestowed	13
upon	13
Camilla;	13
all	13
which	13
Lothario	13
listened	13
to	13
without	13
being	13
able	13
to	13
show	13
any	13
pleasure,	13
for	13
he	13
could	13
not	13
forget	13
how	13
deceived	13
his	13
friend	13
was,	13
and	13
how	13
dishonourably	13
he	13
had	13
wronged	13
him;	13
and	13
though	13
Anselmo	13
could	13
see	13
that	13
Lothario	13
was	13
not	13
glad,	13
still	13
he	13
imagined	13
it	13
was	13
only	13
because	13
he	13
had	13
left	13
Camilla	13
wounded	13
and	13
had	13
been	13
himself	13
the	13
cause	13
of	13
it;	13
and	13
so	13
among	13
other	13
things	13
he	13
told	13
him	13
not	13
to	13
be	13
distressed	13
about	13
Camilla’s	13
accident,	13
for,	13
as	13
they	13
had	13
agreed	13
to	13
hide	13
it	13
from	13
him,	13
the	13
wound	13
was	13
evidently	13
trifling;	13
and	13
that	13
being	13
so,	13
he	13
had	13
no	13
cause	13
for	13
fear,	13
but	13
should	13
henceforward	13
be	13
of	13
good	13
cheer	13
and	13
rejoice	13
with	13
him,	13
seeing	13
that	13
by	13
his	13
means	13
and	13
adroitness	13
he	13
found	13
himself	13
raised	13
to	13
the	13
greatest	13
height	13
of	13
happiness	13
that	13
he	13
could	13
have	13
ventured	13
to	13
hope	13
for,	13
and	13
desired	13
no	13
better	13
pastime	13
than	13
making	13
verses	13
in	13
praise	13
of	13
Camilla	13
that	13
would	13
preserve	13
her	13
name	13
for	13
all	13
time	13
to	13
come.	13
Lothario	13
commended	13
his	13
purpose,	13
and	13
promised	13
on	13
his	13
own	13
part	13
to	13
aid	13
him	13
in	13
raising	13
a	13
monument	13
so	13
glorious.	13
And	13
so	13
Anselmo	13
was	13
left	13
the	13
most	13
charmingly	13
hoodwinked	13
man	13
there	13
could	13
be	13
in	13
the	13
world.	13
He	13
himself,	13
persuaded	13
he	13
was	13
conducting	13
the	13
instrument	13
of	13
his	13
glory,	13
led	13
home	13
by	13
the	13
hand	13
of	13
him	13
who	13
had	13
been	13
the	13
utter	13
destruction	13
of	13
his	13
good	13
name;	13
whom	13
Camilla	13
received	13
with	13
averted	13
countenance,	13
though	13
with	13
smiles	13
in	13
her	13
heart.	13
The	13
deception	13
was	13
carried	13
on	13
for	13
some	13
time,	13
until	13
at	13
the	13
end	13
of	13
a	13
few	13
months	13
Fortune	13
turned	13
her	13
wheel	13
and	13
the	13
guilt	13
which	13
had	13
been	13
until	13
then	13
so	13
skilfully	13
concealed	13
was	13
published	13
abroad,	13
and	13
Anselmo	13
paid	13
with	13
his	13
life	13
the	13
penalty	13
of	13
his	13
ill-advised	13
curiosity.	13

HAD	13
WITH	13
CERTAIN	13
SKINS	13

BRINGS	13
THE	13
NOVEL	13
OF	13
“THE	13
ILL-ADVISED	13
CURIOSITY”	13
TO	13
A	13
CLOSE	13
There	13
remained	13
but	13
little	13
more	13
of	13
the	13
novel	13
to	13
be	13
read,	13
when	13
Sancho	13
Panza	13
burst	13
forth	13
in	13
wild	13
excitement	13
from	13
the	13
garret	13
where	13
Don	13
Quixote	13
was	13
lying,	13
shouting,	13
“Run,	13
sirs!	13
quick;	13
and	13
help	13
my	13
master,	13
who	13
is	13
in	13
the	13
thick	13
of	13
the	13
toughest	13
and	13
stiffest	13
battle	13
I	13
ever	13
laid	13
eyes	13
on.	13
By	13
the	13
living	13
God	13
he	13
has	13
given	13
the	13
giant,	13
the	13
enemy	13
of	13
my	13
lady	13
the	13
Princess	13
Micomicona,	13
such	13
a	13
slash	13
that	13
he	13
has	13
sliced	13
his	13
head	13
clean	13
off	13
as	13
if	13
it	13
were	13
a	13
turnip.”	13
“What	13
are	13
you	13
talking	13
about,	13
brother?”	13
said	13
the	13
curate,	13
pausing	13
as	13
he	13
was	13
about	13
to	13
read	13
the	13
remainder	13
of	13
the	13
novel.	13
“Are	13
you	13
in	13
your	13
senses,	13
Sancho?	13
How	13
the	13
devil	13
can	13
it	13
be	13
as	13
you	13
say,	13
when	13
the	13
giant	13
is	13
two	13
thousand	13
leagues	13
away?”	13
Here	13
they	13
heard	13
a	13
loud	13
noise	13
in	13
the	13
chamber,	13
and	13
Don	13
Quixote	13
shouting	13
out,	13
“Stand,	13
thief,	13
brigand,	13
villain;	13
now	13
I	13
have	13
got	13
thee,	13
and	13
thy	13
scimitar	13
shall	13
not	13
avail	13
thee!”	13
And	13
then	13
it	13
seemed	13
as	13
though	13
he	13
were	13
slashing	13
vigorously	13
at	13
the	13
wall.	13
“Don’t	13
stop	13
to	13
listen,”	13
said	13
Sancho,	13
“but	13
go	13
in	13
and	13
part	13
them	13
or	13
help	13
my	13
master:	13
though	13
there	13
is	13
no	13
need	13
of	13
that	13
now,	13
for	13
no	13
doubt	13
the	13
giant	13
is	13
dead	13
by	13
this	13
time	13
and	13
giving	13
account	13
to	13
God	13
of	13
his	13
past	13
wicked	13
life;	13
for	13
I	13
saw	13
the	13
blood	13
flowing	13
on	13
the	13
ground,	13
and	13
the	13
head	13
cut	13
off	13
and	13
fallen	13
on	13
one	13
side,	13
and	13
it	13
is	13
as	13
big	13
as	13
a	13
large	13
wine-skin.”	13
“May	13
I	13
die,”	13
said	13
the	13
landlord	13
at	13
this,	13
“if	13
Don	13
Quixote	13
or	13
Don	13
Devil	13
has	13
not	13
been	13
slashing	13
some	13
of	13
the	13
skins	13
of	13
red	13
wine	13
that	13
stand	13
full	13
at	13
his	13
bed’s	13
head,	13
and	13
the	13
spilt	13
wine	13
must	13
be	13
what	13
this	13
good	13
fellow	13
takes	13
for	13
blood;”	13
and	13
so	13
saying	13
he	13
went	13
into	13
the	13
room	13
and	13
the	13
rest	13
after	13
him,	13
and	13
there	13
they	13
found	13
Don	13
Quixote	13
in	13
the	13
strangest	13
costume	13
in	13
the	13
world.	13
He	13
was	13
in	13
his	13
shirt,	13
which	13
was	13
not	13
long	13
enough	13
in	13
front	13
to	13
cover	13
his	13
thighs	13
completely	13
and	13
was	13
six	13
fingers	13
shorter	13
behind;	13
his	13
legs	13
were	13
very	13
long	13
and	13
lean,	13
covered	13
with	13
hair,	13
and	13
anything	13
but	13
clean;	13
on	13
his	13
head	13
he	13
had	13
a	13
little	13
greasy	13
red	13
cap	13
that	13
belonged	13
to	13
the	13
host,	13
round	13
his	13
left	13
arm	13
he	13
had	13
rolled	13
the	13
blanket	13
of	13
the	13
bed,	13
to	13
which	13
Sancho,	13
for	13
reasons	13
best	13
known	13
to	13
himself,	13
owed	13
a	13
grudge,	13
and	13
in	13
his	13
right	13
hand	13
he	13
held	13
his	13
unsheathed	13
sword,	13
with	13
which	13
he	13
was	13
slashing	13
about	13
on	13
all	13
sides,	13
uttering	13
exclamations	13
as	13
if	13
he	13
were	13
actually	13
fighting	13
some	13
giant:	13
and	13
the	13
best	13
of	13
it	13
was	13
his	13
eyes	13
were	13
not	13
open,	13
for	13
he	13
was	13
fast	13
asleep,	13
and	13
dreaming	13
that	13
he	13
was	13
doing	13
battle	13
with	13
the	13
giant.	13
For	13
his	13
imagination	13
was	13
so	13
wrought	13
upon	13
by	13
the	13
adventure	13
he	13
was	13
going	13
to	13
accomplish,	13
that	13
it	13
made	13
him	13
dream	13
he	13
had	13
already	13
reached	13
the	13
kingdom	13
of	13
Micomicon,	13
and	13
was	13
engaged	13
in	13
combat	13
with	13
his	13
enemy;	13
and	13
believing	13
he	13
was	13
laying	13
on	13
the	13
giant,	13
he	13
had	13
given	13
so	13
many	13
sword	13
cuts	13
to	13
the	13
skins	13
that	13
the	13
whole	13
room	13
was	13
full	13
of	13
wine.	13
On	13
seeing	13
this	13
the	13
landlord	13
was	13
so	13
enraged	13
that	13
he	13
fell	13
on	13
Don	13
Quixote,	13
and	13
with	13
his	13
clenched	13
fist	13
began	13
to	13
pummel	13
him	13
in	13
such	13
a	13
way,	13
that	13
if	13
Cardenio	13
and	13
the	13
curate	13
had	13
not	13
dragged	13
him	13
off,	13
he	13
would	13
have	13
brought	13
the	13
war	13
of	13
the	13
giant	13
to	13
an	13
end.	13
But	13
in	13
spite	13
of	13
all	13
the	13
poor	13
gentleman	13
never	13
woke	13
until	13
the	13
barber	13
brought	13
a	13
great	13
pot	13
of	13
cold	13
water	13
from	13
the	13
well	13
and	13
flung	13
it	13
with	13
one	13
dash	13
all	13
over	13
his	13
body,	13
on	13
which	13
Don	13
Quixote	13
woke	13
up,	13
but	13
not	13
so	13
completely	13
as	13
to	13
understand	13
what	13
was	13
the	13
matter.	13
Dorothea,	13
seeing	13
how	13
short	13
and	13
slight	13
his	13
attire	13
was,	13
would	13
not	13
go	13
in	13
to	13
witness	13
the	13
battle	13
between	13
her	13
champion	13
and	13
her	13
opponent.	13
As	13
for	13
Sancho,	13
he	13
went	13
searching	13
all	13
over	13
the	13
floor	13
for	13
the	13
head	13
of	13
the	13
giant,	13
and	13
not	13
finding	13
it	13
he	13
said,	13
“I	13
see	13
now	13
that	13
it’s	13
all	13
enchantment	13
in	13
this	13
house;	13
for	13
the	13
last	13
time,	13
on	13
this	13
very	13
spot	13
where	13
I	13
am	13
now,	13
I	13
got	13
ever	13
so	13
many	13
thumps	13
without	13
knowing	13
who	13
gave	13
them	13
to	13
me,	13
or	13
being	13
able	13
to	13
see	13
anybody;	13
and	13
now	13
this	13
head	13
is	13
not	13
to	13
be	13
seen	13
anywhere	13
about,	13
though	13
I	13
saw	13
it	13
cut	13
off	13
with	13
my	13
own	13
eyes	13
and	13
the	13
blood	13
running	13
from	13
the	13
body	13
as	13
if	13
from	13
a	13
fountain.”	13
“What	13
blood	13
and	13
fountains	13
are	13
you	13
talking	13
about,	13
enemy	13
of	13
God	13
and	13
his	13
saints?”	13
said	13
the	13
landlord.	13
“Don’t	13
you	13
see,	13
you	13
thief,	13
that	13
the	13
blood	13
and	13
the	13
fountain	13
are	13
only	13
these	13
skins	13
here	13
that	13
have	13
been	13
stabbed	13
and	13
the	13
red	13
wine	13
swimming	13
all	13
over	13
the	13
room?—and	13
I	13
wish	13
I	13
saw	13
the	13
soul	13
of	13
him	13
that	13
stabbed	13
them	13
swimming	13
in	13
hell.”	13
“I	13
know	13
nothing	13
about	13
that,”	13
said	13
Sancho;	13
“all	13
I	13
know	13
is	13
it	13
will	13
be	13
my	13
bad	13
luck	13
that	13
through	13
not	13
finding	13
this	13
head	13
my	13
county	13
will	13
melt	13
away	13
like	13
salt	13
in	13
water;”—for	13
Sancho	13
awake	13
was	13
worse	13
than	13
his	13
master	13
asleep,	13
so	13
much	13
had	13
his	13
master’s	13
promises	13
addled	13
his	13
wits.	13
The	13
landlord	13
was	13
beside	13
himself	13
at	13
the	13
coolness	13
of	13
the	13
squire	13
and	13
the	13
mischievous	13
doings	13
of	13
the	13
master,	13
and	13
swore	13
it	13
should	13
not	13
be	13
like	13
the	13
last	13
time	13
when	13
they	13
went	13
without	13
paying;	13
and	13
that	13
their	13
privileges	13
of	13
chivalry	13
should	13
not	13
hold	13
good	13
this	13
time	13
to	13
let	13
one	13
or	13
other	13
of	13
them	13
off	13
without	13
paying,	13
even	13
to	13
the	13
cost	13
of	13
the	13
plugs	13
that	13
would	13
have	13
to	13
be	13
put	13
to	13
the	13
damaged	13
wine-skins.	13
The	13
curate	13
was	13
holding	13
Don	13
Quixote’s	13
hands,	13
who,	13
fancying	13
he	13
had	13
now	13
ended	13
the	13
adventure	13
and	13
was	13
in	13
the	13
presence	13
of	13
the	13
Princess	13
Micomicona,	13
knelt	13
before	13
the	13
curate	13
and	13
said,	13
“Exalted	13
and	13
beauteous	13
lady,	13
your	13
highness	13
may	13
live	13
from	13
this	13
day	13
forth	13
fearless	13
of	13
any	13
harm	13
this	13
base	13
being	13
could	13
do	13
you;	13
and	13
I	13
too	13
from	13
this	13
day	13
forth	13
am	13
released	13
from	13
the	13
promise	13
I	13
gave	13
you,	13
since	13
by	13
the	13
help	13
of	13
God	13
on	13
high	13
and	13
by	13
the	13
favour	13
of	13
her	13
by	13
whom	13
I	13
live	13
and	13
breathe,	13
I	13
have	13
fulfilled	13
it	13
so	13
successfully.”	13
“Did	13
not	13
I	13
say	13
so?”	13
said	13
Sancho	13
on	13
hearing	13
this.	13
“You	13
see	13
I	13
wasn’t	13
drunk;	13
there	13
you	13
see	13
my	13
master	13
has	13
already	13
salted	13
the	13
giant;	13
there’s	13
no	13
doubt	13
about	13
the	13
bulls;	13
my	13
county	13
is	13
all	13
right!”	13
Who	13
could	13
have	13
helped	13
laughing	13
at	13
the	13
absurdities	13
of	13
the	13
pair,	13
master	13
and	13
man?	13
And	13
laugh	13
they	13
did,	13
all	13
except	13
the	13
landlord,	13
who	13
cursed	13
himself;	13
but	13
at	13
length	13
the	13
barber,	13
Cardenio,	13
and	13
the	13
curate	13
contrived	13
with	13
no	13
small	13
trouble	13
to	13
get	13
Don	13
Quixote	13
on	13
the	13
bed,	13
and	13
he	13
fell	13
asleep	13
with	13
every	13
appearance	13
of	13
excessive	13
weariness.	13
They	13
left	13
him	13
to	13
sleep,	13
and	13
came	13
out	13
to	13
the	13
gate	13
of	13
the	13
inn	13
to	13
console	13
Sancho	13
Panza	13
on	13
not	13
having	13
found	13
the	13
head	13
of	13
the	13
giant;	13
but	13
much	13
more	13
work	13
had	13
they	13
to	13
appease	13
the	13
landlord,	13
who	13
was	13
furious	13
at	13
the	13
sudden	13
death	13
of	13
his	13
wine-skins;	13
and	13
said	13
the	13
landlady	13
half	13
scolding,	13
half	13
crying,	13
“At	13
an	13
evil	13
moment	13
and	13
in	13
an	13
unlucky	13
hour	13
he	13
came	13
into	13
my	13
house,	13
this	13
knight-errant—would	13
that	13
I	13
had	13
never	13
set	13
eyes	13
on	13
him,	13
for	13
dear	13
he	13
has	13
cost	13
me;	13
the	13
last	13
time	13
he	13
went	13
off	13
with	13
the	13
overnight	13
score	13
against	13
him	13
for	13
supper,	13
bed,	13
straw,	13
and	13
barley,	13
for	13
himself	13
and	13
his	13
squire	13
and	13
a	13
hack	13
and	13
an	13
ass,	13
saying	13
he	13
was	13
a	13
knight	13
adventurer—God	13
send	13
unlucky	13
adventures	13
to	13
him	13
and	13
all	13
the	13
adventurers	13
in	13
the	13
world—and	13
therefore	13
not	13
bound	13
to	13
pay	13
anything,	13
for	13
it	13
was	13
so	13
settled	13
by	13
the	13
knight-errantry	13
tariff:	13
and	13
then,	13
all	13
because	13
of	13
him,	13
came	13
the	13
other	13
gentleman	13
and	13
carried	13
off	13
my	13
tail,	13
and	13
gives	13
it	13
back	13
more	13
than	13
two	13
cuartillos	13
the	13
worse,	13
all	13
stripped	13
of	13
its	13
hair,	13
so	13
that	13
it	13
is	13
no	13
use	13
for	13
my	13
husband’s	13
purpose;	13
and	13
then,	13
for	13
a	13
finishing	13
touch	13
to	13
all,	13
to	13
burst	13
my	13
wine-skins	13
and	13
spill	13
my	13
wine!	13
I	13
wish	13
I	13
saw	13
his	13
own	13
blood	13
spilt!	13
But	13
let	13
him	13
not	13
deceive	13
himself,	13
for,	13
by	13
the	13
bones	13
of	13
my	13
father	13
and	13
the	13
shade	13
of	13
my	13
mother,	13
they	13
shall	13
pay	13
me	13
down	13
every	13
quarts;	13
or	13
my	13
name	13
is	13
not	13
what	13
it	13
is,	13
and	13
I	13
am	13
not	13
my	13
father’s	13
daughter.”	13
All	13
this	13
and	13
more	13
to	13
the	13
same	13
effect	13
the	13
landlady	13
delivered	13
with	13
great	13
irritation,	13
and	13
her	13
good	13
maid	13
Maritornes	13
backed	13
her	13
up,	13
while	13
the	13
daughter	13
held	13
her	13
peace	13
and	13
smiled	13
from	13
time	13
to	13
time.	13
The	13
curate	13
smoothed	13
matters	13
by	13
promising	13
to	13
make	13
good	13
all	13
losses	13
to	13
the	13
best	13
of	13
his	13
power,	13
not	13
only	13
as	13
regarded	13
the	13
wine-skins	13
but	13
also	13
the	13
wine,	13
and	13
above	13
all	13
the	13
depreciation	13
of	13
the	13
tail	13
which	13
they	13
set	13
such	13
store	13
by.	13
Dorothea	13
comforted	13
Sancho,	13
telling	13
him	13
that	13
she	13
pledged	13
herself,	13
as	13
soon	13
as	13
it	13
should	13
appear	13
certain	13
that	13
his	13
master	13
had	13
decapitated	13
the	13
giant,	13
and	13
she	13
found	13
herself	13
peacefully	13
established	13
in	13
her	13
kingdom,	13
to	13
bestow	13
upon	13
him	13
the	13
best	13
county	13
there	13
was	13
in	13
it.	13
With	13
this	13
Sancho	13
consoled	13
himself,	13
and	13
assured	13
the	13
princess	13
she	13
might	13
rely	13
upon	13
it	13
that	13
he	13
had	13
seen	13
the	13
head	13
of	13
the	13
giant,	13
and	13
more	13
by	13
token	13
it	13
had	13
a	13
beard	13
that	13
reached	13
to	13
the	13
girdle,	13
and	13
that	13
if	13
it	13
was	13
not	13
to	13
be	13
seen	13
now	13
it	13
was	13
because	13
everything	13
that	13
happened	13
in	13
that	13
house	13
went	13
by	13
enchantment,	13
as	13
he	13
himself	13
had	13
proved	13
the	13
last	13
time	13
he	13
had	13
lodged	13
there.	13
Dorothea	13
said	13
she	13
fully	13
believed	13
it,	13
and	13
that	13
he	13
need	13
not	13
be	13
uneasy,	13
for	13
all	13
would	13
go	13
well	13
and	13
turn	13
out	13
as	13
he	13
wished.	13
All	13
therefore	13
being	13
appeased,	13
the	13
curate	13
was	13
anxious	13
to	13
go	13
on	13
with	13
the	13
novel,	13
as	13
he	13
saw	13
there	13
was	13
but	13
little	13
more	13
left	13
to	13
read.	13
Dorothea	13
and	13
the	13
others	13
begged	13
him	13
to	13
finish	13
it,	13
and	13
he,	13
as	13
he	13
was	13
willing	13
to	13
please	13
them,	13
and	13
enjoyed	13
reading	13
it	13
himself,	13
continued	13
the	13
tale	13
in	13
these	13
words:	13
The	13
result	13
was,	13
that	13
from	13
the	13
confidence	13
Anselmo	13
felt	13
in	13
Camilla’s	13
virtue,	13
he	13
lived	13
happy	13
and	13
free	13
from	13
anxiety,	13
and	13
Camilla	13
purposely	13
looked	13
coldly	13
on	13
Lothario,	13
that	13
Anselmo	13
might	13
suppose	13
her	13
feelings	13
towards	13
him	13
to	13
be	13
the	13
opposite	13
of	13
what	13
they	13
were;	13
and	13
the	13
better	13
to	13
support	13
the	13
position,	13
Lothario	13
begged	13
to	13
be	13
excused	13
from	13
coming	13
to	13
the	13
house,	13
as	13
the	13
displeasure	13
with	13
which	13
Camilla	13
regarded	13
his	13
presence	13
was	13
plain	13
to	13
be	13
seen.	13
But	13
the	13
befooled	13
Anselmo	13
said	13
he	13
would	13
on	13
no	13
account	13
allow	13
such	13
a	13
thing,	13
and	13
so	13
in	13
a	13
thousand	13
ways	13
he	13
became	13
the	13
author	13
of	13
his	13
own	13
dishonour,	13
while	13
he	13
believed	13
he	13
was	13
insuring	13
his	13
happiness.	13
Meanwhile	13
the	13
satisfaction	13
with	13
which	13
Leonela	13
saw	13
herself	13
empowered	13
to	13
carry	13
on	13
her	13
amour	13
reached	13
such	13
a	13
height	13
that,	13
regardless	13
of	13
everything	13
else,	13
she	13
followed	13
her	13
inclinations	13
unrestrainedly,	13
feeling	13
confident	13
that	13
her	13
mistress	13
would	13
screen	13
her,	13
and	13
even	13
show	13
her	13
how	13
to	13
manage	13
it	13
safely.	13
At	13
last	13
one	13
night	13
Anselmo	13
heard	13
footsteps	13
in	13
Leonela’s	13
room,	13
and	13
on	13
trying	13
to	13
enter	13
to	13
see	13
who	13
it	13
was,	13
he	13
found	13
that	13
the	13
door	13
was	13
held	13
against	13
him,	13
which	13
made	13
him	13
all	13
the	13
more	13
determined	13
to	13
open	13
it;	13
and	13
exerting	13
his	13
strength	13
he	13
forced	13
it	13
open,	13
and	13
entered	13
the	13
room	13
in	13
time	13
to	13
see	13
a	13
man	13
leaping	13
through	13
the	13
window	13
into	13
the	13
street.	13
He	13
ran	13
quickly	13
to	13
seize	13
him	13
or	13
discover	13
who	13
he	13
was,	13
but	13
he	13
was	13
unable	13
to	13
effect	13
either	13
purpose,	13
for	13
Leonela	13
flung	13
her	13
arms	13
round	13
him	13
crying,	13
“Be	13
calm,	13
señor;	13
do	13
not	13
give	13
way	13
to	13
passion	13
or	13
follow	13
him	13
who	13
has	13
escaped	13
from	13
this;	13
he	13
belongs	13
to	13
me,	13
and	13
in	13
fact	13
he	13
is	13
my	13
husband.”	13
Anselmo	13
would	13
not	13
believe	13
it,	13
but	13
blind	13
with	13
rage	13
drew	13
a	13
dagger	13
and	13
threatened	13
to	13
stab	13
Leonela,	13
bidding	13
her	13
tell	13
the	13
truth	13
or	13
he	13
would	13
kill	13
her.	13
She,	13
in	13
her	13
fear,	13
not	13
knowing	13
what	13
she	13
was	13
saying,	13
exclaimed,	13
“Do	13
not	13
kill	13
me,	13
señor,	13
for	13
I	13
can	13
tell	13
you	13
things	13
more	13
important	13
than	13
any	13
you	13
can	13
imagine.”	13
“Tell	13
me	13
then	13
at	13
once	13
or	13
thou	13
diest,”	13
said	13
Anselmo.	13
“It	13
would	13
be	13
impossible	13
for	13
me	13
now,”	13
said	13
Leonela,	13
“I	13
am	13
so	13
agitated:	13
leave	13
me	13
till	13
to-morrow,	13
and	13
then	13
you	13
shall	13
hear	13
from	13
me	13
what	13
will	13
fill	13
you	13
with	13
astonishment;	13
but	13
rest	13
assured	13
that	13
he	13
who	13
leaped	13
through	13
the	13
window	13
is	13
a	13
young	13
man	13
of	13
this	13
city,	13
who	13
has	13
given	13
me	13
his	13
promise	13
to	13
become	13
my	13
husband.”	13
Anselmo	13
was	13
appeased	13
with	13
this,	13
and	13
was	13
content	13
to	13
wait	13
the	13
time	13
she	13
asked	13
of	13
him,	13
for	13
he	13
never	13
expected	13
to	13
hear	13
anything	13
against	13
Camilla,	13
so	13
satisfied	13
and	13
sure	13
of	13
her	13
virtue	13
was	13
he;	13
and	13
so	13
he	13
quitted	13
the	13
room,	13
and	13
left	13
Leonela	13
locked	13
in,	13
telling	13
her	13
she	13
should	13
not	13
come	13
out	13
until	13
she	13
had	13
told	13
him	13
all	13
she	13
had	13
to	13
make	13
known	13
to	13
him.	13
He	13
went	13
at	13
once	13
to	13
see	13
Camilla,	13
and	13
tell	13
her,	13
as	13
he	13
did,	13
all	13
that	13
had	13
passed	13
between	13
him	13
and	13
her	13
handmaid,	13
and	13
the	13
promise	13
she	13
had	13
given	13
him	13
to	13
inform	13
him	13
matters	13
of	13
serious	13
importance.	13
There	13
is	13
no	13
need	13
of	13
saying	13
whether	13
Camilla	13
was	13
agitated	13
or	13
not,	13
for	13
so	13
great	13
was	13
her	13
fear	13
and	13
dismay,	13
that,	13
making	13
sure,	13
as	13
she	13
had	13
good	13
reason	13
to	13
do,	13
that	13
Leonela	13
would	13
tell	13
Anselmo	13
all	13
she	13
knew	13
of	13
her	13
faithlessness,	13
she	13
had	13
not	13
the	13
courage	13
to	13
wait	13
and	13
see	13
if	13
her	13
suspicions	13
were	13
confirmed;	13
and	13
that	13
same	13
night,	13
as	13
soon	13
as	13
she	13
thought	13
that	13
Anselmo	13
was	13
asleep,	13
she	13
packed	13
up	13
the	13
most	13
valuable	13
jewels	13
she	13
had	13
and	13
some	13
money,	13
and	13
without	13
being	13
observed	13
by	13
anybody	13
escaped	13
from	13
the	13
house	13
and	13
betook	13
herself	13
to	13
Lothario’s,	13
to	13
whom	13
she	13
related	13
what	13
had	13
occurred,	13
imploring	13
him	13
to	13
convey	13
her	13
to	13
some	13
place	13
of	13
safety	13
or	13
fly	13
with	13
her	13
where	13
they	13
might	13
be	13
safe	13
from	13
Anselmo.	13
The	13
state	13
of	13
perplexity	13
to	13
which	13
Camilla	13
reduced	13
Lothario	13
was	13
such	13
that	13
he	13
was	13
unable	13
to	13
utter	13
a	13
word	13
in	13
reply,	13
still	13
less	13
to	13
decide	13
upon	13
what	13
he	13
should	13
do.	13
At	13
length	13
he	13
resolved	13
to	13
conduct	13
her	13
to	13
a	13
convent	13
of	13
which	13
a	13
sister	13
of	13
his	13
was	13
prioress;	13
Camilla	13
agreed	13
to	13
this,	13
and	13
with	13
the	13
speed	13
which	13
the	13
circumstances	13
demanded,	13
Lothario	13
took	13
her	13
to	13
the	13
convent	13
and	13
left	13
her	13
there,	13
and	13
then	13
himself	13
quitted	13
the	13
city	13
without	13
letting	13
anyone	13
know	13
of	13
his	13
departure.	13
As	13
soon	13
as	13
daylight	13
came	13
Anselmo,	13
without	13
missing	13
Camilla	13
from	13
his	13
side,	13
rose	13
eager	13
to	13
learn	13
what	13
Leonela	13
had	13
to	13
tell	13
him,	13
and	13
hastened	13
to	13
the	13
room	13
where	13
he	13
had	13
locked	13
her	13
in.	13
He	13
opened	13
the	13
door,	13
entered,	13
but	13
found	13
no	13
Leonela;	13
all	13
he	13
found	13
was	13
some	13
sheets	13
knotted	13
to	13
the	13
window,	13
a	13
plain	13
proof	13
that	13
she	13
had	13
let	13
herself	13
down	13
from	13
it	13
and	13
escaped.	13
He	13
returned,	13
uneasy,	13
to	13
tell	13
Camilla,	13
but	13
not	13
finding	13
her	13
in	13
bed	13
or	13
anywhere	13
in	13
the	13
house	13
he	13
was	13
lost	13
in	13
amazement.	13
He	13
asked	13
the	13
servants	13
of	13
the	13
house	13
about	13
her,	13
but	13
none	13
of	13
them	13
could	13
give	13
him	13
any	13
explanation.	13
As	13
he	13
was	13
going	13
in	13
search	13
of	13
Camilla	13
it	13
happened	13
by	13
chance	13
that	13
he	13
observed	13
her	13
boxes	13
were	13
lying	13
open,	13
and	13
that	13
the	13
greater	13
part	13
of	13
her	13
jewels	13
were	13
gone;	13
and	13
now	13
he	13
became	13
fully	13
aware	13
of	13
his	13
disgrace,	13
and	13
that	13
Leonela	13
was	13
not	13
the	13
cause	13
of	13
his	13
misfortune;	13
and,	13
just	13
as	13
he	13
was,	13
without	13
delaying	13
to	13
dress	13
himself	13
completely,	13
he	13
repaired,	13
sad	13
at	13
heart	13
and	13
dejected,	13
to	13
his	13
friend	13
Lothario	13
to	13
make	13
known	13
his	13
sorrow	13
to	13
him;	13
but	13
when	13
he	13
failed	13
to	13
find	13
him	13
and	13
the	13
servants	13
reported	13
that	13
he	13
had	13
been	13
absent	13
from	13
his	13
house	13
all	13
night	13
and	13
had	13
taken	13
with	13
him	13
all	13
the	13
money	13
he	13
had,	13
he	13
felt	13
as	13
though	13
he	13
were	13
losing	13
his	13
senses;	13
and	13
to	13
make	13
all	13
complete	13
on	13
returning	13
to	13
his	13
own	13
house	13
he	13
found	13
it	13
deserted	13
and	13
empty,	13
not	13
one	13
of	13
all	13
his	13
servants,	13
male	13
or	13
female,	13
remaining	13
in	13
it.	13
He	13
knew	13
not	13
what	13
to	13
think,	13
or	13
say,	13
or	13
do,	13
and	13
his	13
reason	13
seemed	13
to	13
be	13
deserting	13
him	13
little	13
by	13
little.	13
He	13
reviewed	13
his	13
position,	13
and	13
saw	13
himself	13
in	13
a	13
moment	13
left	13
without	13
wife,	13
friend,	13
or	13
servants,	13
abandoned,	13
he	13
felt,	13
by	13
the	13
heaven	13
above	13
him,	13
and	13
more	13
than	13
all	13
robbed	13
of	13
his	13
honour,	13
for	13
in	13
Camilla’s	13
disappearance	13
he	13
saw	13
his	13
own	13
ruin.	13
After	13
long	13
reflection	13
he	13
resolved	13
at	13
last	13
to	13
go	13
to	13
his	13
friend’s	13
village,	13
where	13
he	13
had	13
been	13
staying	13
when	13
he	13
afforded	13
opportunities	13
for	13
the	13
contrivance	13
of	13
this	13
complication	13
of	13
misfortune.	13
He	13
locked	13
the	13
doors	13
of	13
his	13
house,	13
mounted	13
his	13
horse,	13
and	13
with	13
a	13
broken	13
spirit	13
set	13
out	13
on	13
his	13
journey;	13
but	13
he	13
had	13
hardly	13
gone	13
half-way	13
when,	13
harassed	13
by	13
his	13
reflections,	13
he	13
had	13
to	13
dismount	13
and	13
tie	13
his	13
horse	13
to	13
a	13
tree,	13
at	13
the	13
foot	13
of	13
which	13
he	13
threw	13
himself,	13
giving	13
vent	13
to	13
piteous	13
heartrending	13
sighs;	13
and	13
there	13
he	13
remained	13
till	13
nearly	13
nightfall,	13
when	13
he	13
observed	13
a	13
man	13
approaching	13
on	13
horseback	13
from	13
the	13
city,	13
of	13
whom,	13
after	13
saluting	13
him,	13
he	13
asked	13
what	13
was	13
the	13
news	13
in	13
Florence.	13
The	13
citizen	13
replied,	13
“The	13
strangest	13
that	13
have	13
been	13
heard	13
for	13
many	13
a	13
day;	13
for	13
it	13
is	13
reported	13
abroad	13
that	13
Lothario,	13
the	13
great	13
friend	13
of	13
the	13
wealthy	13
Anselmo,	13
who	13
lived	13
at	13
San	13
Giovanni,	13
carried	13
off	13
last	13
night	13
Camilla,	13
the	13
wife	13
of	13
Anselmo,	13
who	13
also	13
has	13
disappeared.	13
All	13
this	13
has	13
been	13
told	13
by	13
a	13
maid-servant	13
of	13
Camilla’s,	13
whom	13
the	13
governor	13
found	13
last	13
night	13
lowering	13
herself	13
by	13
a	13
sheet	13
from	13
the	13
windows	13
of	13
Anselmo’s	13
house.	13
I	13
know	13
not	13
indeed,	13
precisely,	13
how	13
the	13
affair	13
came	13
to	13
pass;	13
all	13
I	13
know	13
is	13
that	13
the	13
whole	13
city	13
is	13
wondering	13
at	13
the	13
occurrence,	13
for	13
no	13
one	13
could	13
have	13
expected	13
a	13
thing	13
of	13
the	13
kind,	13
seeing	13
the	13
great	13
and	13
intimate	13
friendship	13
that	13
existed	13
between	13
them,	13
so	13
great,	13
they	13
say,	13
that	13
they	13
were	13
called	13
‘The	13
Two	13
Friends.’”	13
“Is	13
it	13
known	13
at	13
all,”	13
said	13
Anselmo,	13
“what	13
road	13
Lothario	13
and	13
Camilla	13
took?”	13
“Not	13
in	13
the	13
least,”	13
said	13
the	13
citizen,	13
“though	13
the	13
governor	13
has	13
been	13
very	13
active	13
in	13
searching	13
for	13
them.”	13
“God	13
speed	13
you,	13
señor,”	13
said	13
Anselmo.	13
“God	13
be	13
with	13
you,”	13
said	13
the	13
citizen	13
and	13
went	13
his	13
way.	13
This	13
disastrous	13
intelligence	13
almost	13
robbed	13
Anselmo	13
not	13
only	13
of	13
his	13
senses	13
but	13
of	13
his	13
life.	13
He	13
got	13
up	13
as	13
well	13
as	13
he	13
was	13
able	13
and	13
reached	13
the	13
house	13
of	13
his	13
friend,	13
who	13
as	13
yet	13
knew	13
nothing	13
of	13
his	13
misfortune,	13
but	13
seeing	13
him	13
come	13
pale,	13
worn,	13
and	13
haggard,	13
perceived	13
that	13
he	13
was	13
suffering	13
some	13
heavy	13
affliction.	13
Anselmo	13
at	13
once	13
begged	13
to	13
be	13
allowed	13
to	13
retire	13
to	13
rest,	13
and	13
to	13
be	13
given	13
writing	13
materials.	13
His	13
wish	13
was	13
complied	13
with	13
and	13
he	13
was	13
left	13
lying	13
down	13
and	13
alone,	13
for	13
he	13
desired	13
this,	13
and	13
even	13
that	13
the	13
door	13
should	13
be	13
locked.	13
Finding	13
himself	13
alone	13
he	13
so	13
took	13
to	13
heart	13
the	13
thought	13
of	13
his	13
misfortune	13
that	13
by	13
the	13
signs	13
of	13
death	13
he	13
felt	13
within	13
him	13
he	13
knew	13
well	13
his	13
life	13
was	13
drawing	13
to	13
a	13
close,	13
and	13
therefore	13
he	13
resolved	13
to	13
leave	13
behind	13
him	13
a	13
declaration	13
of	13
the	13
cause	13
of	13
his	13
strange	13
end.	13
He	13
began	13
to	13
write,	13
but	13
before	13
he	13
had	13
put	13
down	13
all	13
he	13
meant	13
to	13
say,	13
his	13
breath	13
failed	13
him	13
and	13
he	13
yielded	13
up	13
his	13
life,	13
a	13
victim	13
to	13
the	13
suffering	13
which	13
his	13
ill-advised	13
curiosity	13
had	13
entailed	13
upon	13
him.	13
The	13
master	13
of	13
the	13
house	13
observing	13
that	13
it	13
was	13
now	13
late	13
and	13
that	13
Anselmo	13
did	13
not	13
call,	13
determined	13
to	13
go	13
in	13
and	13
ascertain	13
if	13
his	13
indisposition	13
was	13
increasing,	13
and	13
found	13
him	13
lying	13
on	13
his	13
face,	13
his	13
body	13
partly	13
in	13
the	13
bed,	13
partly	13
on	13
the	13
writing-table,	13
on	13
which	13
he	13
lay	13
with	13
the	13
written	13
paper	13
open	13
and	13
the	13
pen	13
still	13
in	13
his	13
hand.	13
Having	13
first	13
called	13
to	13
him	13
without	13
receiving	13
any	13
answer,	13
his	13
host	13
approached	13
him,	13
and	13
taking	13
him	13
by	13
the	13
hand,	13
found	13
that	13
it	13
was	13
cold,	13
and	13
saw	13
that	13
he	13
was	13
dead.	13
Greatly	13
surprised	13
and	13
distressed	13
he	13
summoned	13
the	13
household	13
to	13
witness	13
the	13
sad	13
fate	13
which	13
had	13
befallen	13
Anselmo;	13
and	13
then	13
he	13
read	13
the	13
paper,	13
the	13
handwriting	13
of	13
which	13
he	13
recognised	13
as	13
his,	13
and	13
which	13
contained	13
these	13
words:	13
“A	13
foolish	13
and	13
ill-advised	13
desire	13
has	13
robbed	13
me	13
of	13
life.	13
If	13
the	13
news	13
of	13
my	13
death	13
should	13
reach	13
the	13
ears	13
of	13
Camilla,	13
let	13
her	13
know	13
that	13
I	13
forgive	13
her,	13
for	13
she	13
was	13
not	13
bound	13
to	13
perform	13
miracles,	13
nor	13
ought	13
I	13
to	13
have	13
required	13
her	13
to	13
perform	13
them;	13
and	13
since	13
I	13
have	13
been	13
the	13
author	13
of	13
my	13
own	13
dishonour,	13
there	13
is	13
no	13
reason	13
why—”	13
So	13
far	13
Anselmo	13
had	13
written,	13
and	13
thus	13
it	13
was	13
plain	13
that	13
at	13
this	13
point,	13
before	13
he	13
could	13
finish	13
what	13
he	13
had	13
to	13
say,	13
his	13
life	13
came	13
to	13
an	13
end.	13
The	13
next	13
day	13
his	13
friend	13
sent	13
intelligence	13
of	13
his	13
death	13
to	13
his	13
relatives,	13
who	13
had	13
already	13
ascertained	13
his	13
misfortune,	13
as	13
well	13
as	13
the	13
convent	13
where	13
Camilla	13
lay	13
almost	13
on	13
the	13
point	13
of	13
accompanying	13
her	13
husband	13
on	13
that	13
inevitable	13
journey,	13
not	13
on	13
account	13
of	13
the	13
tidings	13
of	13
his	13
death,	13
but	13
because	13
of	13
those	13
she	13
received	13
of	13
her	13
lover’s	13
departure.	13
Although	13
she	13
saw	13
herself	13
a	13
widow,	13
it	13
is	13
said	13
she	13
refused	13
either	13
to	13
quit	13
the	13
convent	13
or	13
take	13
the	13
veil,	13
until,	13
not	13
long	13
afterwards,	13
intelligence	13
reached	13
her	13
that	13
Lothario	13
had	13
been	13
killed	13
in	13
a	13
battle	13
in	13
which	13
M.	13
de	13
Lautrec	13
had	13
been	13
recently	13
engaged	13
with	13
the	13
Great	13
Captain	13
Gonzalo	13
Fernandez	13
de	13
Cordova	13
in	13
the	13
kingdom	13
of	13
Naples,	13
whither	13
her	13
too	13
late	13
repentant	13
lover	13
had	13
repaired.	13
On	13
learning	13
this	13
Camilla	13
took	13
the	13
veil,	13
and	13
shortly	13
afterwards	13
died,	13
worn	13
out	13
by	13
grief	13
and	13
melancholy.	13
This	13
was	13
the	13
end	13
of	13
all	13
three,	13
an	13
end	13
that	13
came	13
of	13
a	13
thoughtless	13
beginning.	13
“I	13
like	13
this	13
novel,”	13
said	13
the	13
curate;	13
“but	13
I	13
cannot	13
persuade	13
myself	13
of	13
its	13
truth;	13
and	13
if	13
it	13
has	13
been	13
invented,	13
the	13
author’s	13
invention	13
is	13
faulty,	13
for	13
it	13
is	13
impossible	13
to	13
imagine	13
any	13
husband	13
so	13
foolish	13
as	13
to	13
try	13
such	13
a	13
costly	13
experiment	13
as	13
Anselmo’s.	13
If	13
it	13
had	13
been	13
represented	13
as	13
occurring	13
between	13
a	13
gallant	13
and	13
his	13
mistress	13
it	13
might	13
pass;	13
but	13
between	13
husband	13
and	13
wife	13
there	13
is	13
something	13
of	13
an	13
impossibility	13
about	13
it.	13
As	13
to	13
the	13
way	13
in	13
which	13
the	13
story	13
is	13
told,	13
however,	13
I	13
have	13
no	13
fault	13
to	13
find.”	13

OCCURRED	13
AT	13
THE	13
INN	13

(124K)	13
Full	13
Size	13
Just	13
at	13
that	13
instant	13
the	13
landlord,	13
who	13
was	13
standing	13
at	13
the	13
gate	13
of	13
the	13
inn,	13
exclaimed,	13
“Here	13
comes	13
a	13
fine	13
troop	13
of	13
guests;	13
if	13
they	13
stop	13
here	13
we	13
may	13
say	13
_gaudeamus_.”	13
“What	13
are	13
they?”	13
said	13
Cardenio.	13
“Four	13
men,”	13
said	13
the	13
landlord,	13
“riding	13
_à	13
la	13
jineta_,	13
with	13
lances	13
and	13
bucklers,	13
and	13
all	13
with	13
black	13
veils,	13
and	13
with	13
them	13
there	13
is	13
a	13
woman	13
in	13
white	13
on	13
a	13
side-saddle,	13
whose	13
face	13
is	13
also	13
veiled,	13
and	13
two	13
attendants	13
on	13
foot.”	13
“Are	13
they	13
very	13
near?”	13
said	13
the	13
curate.	13
“So	13
near,”	13
answered	13
the	13
landlord,	13
“that	13
here	13
they	13
come.”	13
Hearing	13
this	13
Dorothea	13
covered	13
her	13
face,	13
and	13
Cardenio	13
retreated	13
into	13
Don	13
Quixote’s	13
room,	13
and	13
they	13
hardly	13
had	13
time	13
to	13
do	13
so	13
before	13
the	13
whole	13
party	13
the	13
host	13
had	13
described	13
entered	13
the	13
inn,	13
and	13
the	13
four	13
that	13
were	13
on	13
horseback,	13
who	13
were	13
of	13
highbred	13
appearance	13
and	13
bearing,	13
dismounted,	13
and	13
came	13
forward	13
to	13
take	13
down	13
the	13
woman	13
who	13
rode	13
on	13
the	13
side-saddle,	13
and	13
one	13
of	13
them	13
taking	13
her	13
in	13
his	13
arms	13
placed	13
her	13
in	13
a	13
chair	13
that	13
stood	13
at	13
the	13
entrance	13
of	13
the	13
room	13
where	13
Cardenio	13
had	13
hidden	13
himself.	13
All	13
this	13
time	13
neither	13
she	13
nor	13
they	13
had	13
removed	13
their	13
veils	13
or	13
spoken	13
a	13
word,	13
only	13
on	13
sitting	13
down	13
on	13
the	13
chair	13
the	13
woman	13
gave	13
a	13
deep	13
sigh	13
and	13
let	13
her	13
arms	13
fall	13
like	13
one	13
that	13
was	13
ill	13
and	13
weak.	13
The	13
attendants	13
on	13
foot	13
then	13
led	13
the	13
horses	13
away	13
to	13
the	13
stable.	13
Observing	13
this	13
the	13
curate,	13
curious	13
to	13
know	13
who	13
these	13
people	13
in	13
such	13
a	13
dress	13
and	13
preserving	13
such	13
silence	13
were,	13
went	13
to	13
where	13
the	13
servants	13
were	13
standing	13
and	13
put	13
the	13
question	13
to	13
one	13
of	13
them,	13
who	13
answered	13
him.	13
“Faith,	13
sir,	13
I	13
cannot	13
tell	13
you	13
who	13
they	13
are,	13
I	13
only	13
know	13
they	13
seem	13
to	13
be	13
people	13
of	13
distinction,	13
particularly	13
he	13
who	13
advanced	13
to	13
take	13
the	13
lady	13
you	13
saw	13
in	13
his	13
arms;	13
and	13
I	13
say	13
so	13
because	13
all	13
the	13
rest	13
show	13
him	13
respect,	13
and	13
nothing	13
is	13
done	13
except	13
what	13
he	13
directs	13
and	13
orders.”	13
“And	13
the	13
lady,	13
who	13
is	13
she?”	13
asked	13
the	13
curate.	13
“That	13
I	13
cannot	13
tell	13
you	13
either,”	13
said	13
the	13
servant,	13
“for	13
I	13
have	13
not	13
seen	13
her	13
face	13
all	13
the	13
way:	13
I	13
have	13
indeed	13
heard	13
her	13
sigh	13
many	13
times	13
and	13
utter	13
such	13
groans	13
that	13
she	13
seems	13
to	13
be	13
giving	13
up	13
the	13
ghost	13
every	13
time;	13
but	13
it	13
is	13
no	13
wonder	13
if	13
we	13
do	13
not	13
know	13
more	13
than	13
we	13
have	13
told	13
you,	13
as	13
my	13
comrade	13
and	13
I	13
have	13
only	13
been	13
in	13
their	13
company	13
two	13
days,	13
for	13
having	13
met	13
us	13
on	13
the	13
road	13
they	13
begged	13
and	13
persuaded	13
us	13
to	13
accompany	13
them	13
to	13
Andalusia,	13
promising	13
to	13
pay	13
us	13
well.”	13
“And	13
have	13
you	13
heard	13
any	13
of	13
them	13
called	13
by	13
his	13
name?”	13
asked	13
the	13
curate.	13
“No,	13
indeed,”	13
replied	13
the	13
servant;	13
“they	13
all	13
preserve	13
a	13
marvellous	13
silence	13
on	13
the	13
road,	13
for	13
not	13
a	13
sound	13
is	13
to	13
be	13
heard	13
among	13
them	13
except	13
the	13
poor	13
lady’s	13
sighs	13
and	13
sobs,	13
which	13
make	13
us	13
pity	13
her;	13
and	13
we	13
feel	13
sure	13
that	13
wherever	13
it	13
is	13
she	13
is	13
going,	13
it	13
is	13
against	13
her	13
will,	13
and	13
as	13
far	13
as	13
one	13
can	13
judge	13
from	13
her	13
dress	13
she	13
is	13
a	13
nun	13
or,	13
what	13
is	13
more	13
likely,	13
about	13
to	13
become	13
one;	13
and	13
perhaps	13
it	13
is	13
because	13
taking	13
the	13
vows	13
is	13
not	13
of	13
her	13
own	13
free	13
will,	13
that	13
she	13
is	13
so	13
unhappy	13
as	13
she	13
seems	13
to	13
be.”	13
“That	13
may	13
well	13
be,”	13
said	13
the	13
curate,	13
and	13
leaving	13
them	13
he	13
returned	13
to	13
where	13
Dorothea	13
was,	13
who,	13
hearing	13
the	13
veiled	13
lady	13
sigh,	13
moved	13
by	13
natural	13
compassion	13
drew	13
near	13
to	13
her	13
and	13
said,	13
“What	13
are	13
you	13
suffering	13
from,	13
señora?	13
If	13
it	13
be	13
anything	13
that	13
women	13
are	13
accustomed	13
and	13
know	13
how	13
to	13
relieve,	13
I	13
offer	13
you	13
my	13
services	13
with	13
all	13
my	13
heart.”	13
To	13
this	13
the	13
unhappy	13
lady	13
made	13
no	13
reply;	13
and	13
though	13
Dorothea	13
repeated	13
her	13
offers	13
more	13
earnestly	13
she	13
still	13
kept	13
silence,	13
until	13
the	13
gentleman	13
with	13
the	13
veil,	13
who,	13
the	13
servant	13
said,	13
was	13
obeyed	13
by	13
the	13
rest,	13
approached	13
and	13
said	13
to	13
Dorothea,	13
“Do	13
not	13
give	13
yourself	13
the	13
trouble,	13
señora,	13
of	13
making	13
any	13
offers	13
to	13
that	13
woman,	13
for	13
it	13
is	13
her	13
way	13
to	13
give	13
no	13
thanks	13
for	13
anything	13
that	13
is	13
done	13
for	13
her;	13
and	13
do	13
not	13
try	13
to	13
make	13
her	13
answer	13
unless	13
you	13
want	13
to	13
hear	13
some	13
lie	13
from	13
her	13
lips.”	13
“I	13
have	13
never	13
told	13
a	13
lie,”	13
was	13
the	13
immediate	13
reply	13
of	13
her	13
who	13
had	13
been	13
silent	13
until	13
now;	13
“on	13
the	13
contrary,	13
it	13
is	13
because	13
I	13
am	13
so	13
truthful	13
and	13
so	13
ignorant	13
of	13
lying	13
devices	13
that	13
I	13
am	13
now	13
in	13
this	13
miserable	13
condition;	13
and	13
this	13
I	13
call	13
you	13
yourself	13
to	13
witness,	13
for	13
it	13
is	13
my	13
unstained	13
truth	13
that	13
has	13
made	13
you	13
false	13
and	13
a	13
liar.”	13
Cardenio	13
heard	13
these	13
words	13
clearly	13
and	13
distinctly,	13
being	13
quite	13
close	13
to	13
the	13
speaker,	13
for	13
there	13
was	13
only	13
the	13
door	13
of	13
Don	13
Quixote’s	13
room	13
between	13
them,	13
and	13
the	13
instant	13
he	13
did	13
so,	13
uttering	13
a	13
loud	13
exclamation	13
he	13
cried,	13
“Good	13
God!	13
what	13
is	13
this	13
I	13
hear?	13
What	13
voice	13
is	13
this	13
that	13
has	13
reached	13
my	13
ears?”	13
Startled	13
at	13
the	13
voice	13
the	13
lady	13
turned	13
her	13
head;	13
and	13
not	13
seeing	13
the	13
speaker	13
she	13
stood	13
up	13
and	13
attempted	13
to	13
enter	13
the	13
room;	13
observing	13
which	13
the	13
gentleman	13
held	13
her	13
back,	13
preventing	13
her	13
from	13
moving	13
a	13
step.	13
In	13
her	13
agitation	13
and	13
sudden	13
movement	13
the	13
silk	13
with	13
which	13
she	13
had	13
covered	13
her	13
face	13
fell	13
off	13
and	13
disclosed	13
a	13
countenance	13
of	13
incomparable	13
and	13
marvellous	13
beauty,	13
but	13
pale	13
and	13
terrified;	13
for	13
she	13
kept	13
turning	13
her	13
eyes,	13
everywhere	13
she	13
could	13
direct	13
her	13
gaze,	13
with	13
an	13
eagerness	13
that	13
made	13
her	13
look	13
as	13
if	13
she	13
had	13
lost	13
her	13
senses,	13
and	13
so	13
marked	13
that	13
it	13
excited	13
the	13
pity	13
of	13
Dorothea	13
and	13
all	13
who	13
beheld	13
her,	13
though	13
they	13
knew	13
not	13
what	13
caused	13
it.	13
The	13
gentleman	13
grasped	13
her	13
firmly	13
by	13
the	13
shoulders,	13
and	13
being	13
so	13
fully	13
occupied	13
with	13
holding	13
her	13
back,	13
he	13
was	13
unable	13
to	13
put	13
a	13
hand	13
to	13
his	13
veil	13
which	13
was	13
falling	13
off,	13
as	13
it	13
did	13
at	13
length	13
entirely,	13
and	13
Dorothea,	13
who	13
was	13
holding	13
the	13
lady	13
in	13
her	13
arms,	13
raising	13
her	13
eyes	13
saw	13
that	13
he	13
who	13
likewise	13
held	13
her	13
was	13
her	13
husband,	13
Don	13
Fernando.	13
The	13
instant	13
she	13
recognised	13
him,	13
with	13
a	13
prolonged	13
plaintive	13
cry	13
drawn	13
from	13
the	13
depths	13
of	13
her	13
heart,	13
she	13
fell	13
backwards	13
fainting,	13
and	13
but	13
for	13
the	13
barber	13
being	13
close	13
by	13
to	13
catch	13
her	13
in	13
his	13
arms,	13
she	13
would	13
have	13
fallen	13
completely	13
to	13
the	13
ground.	13
The	13
curate	13
at	13
once	13
hastened	13
to	13
uncover	13
her	13
face	13
and	13
throw	13
water	13
on	13
it,	13
and	13
as	13
he	13
did	13
so	13
Don	13
Fernando,	13
for	13
he	13
it	13
was	13
who	13
held	13
the	13
other	13
in	13
his	13
arms,	13
recognised	13
her	13
and	13
stood	13
as	13
if	13
death-stricken	13
by	13
the	13
sight;	13
not,	13
however,	13
relaxing	13
his	13
grasp	13
of	13
Luscinda,	13
for	13
it	13
was	13
she	13
that	13
was	13
struggling	13
to	13
release	13
herself	13
from	13
his	13
hold,	13
having	13
recognised	13
Cardenio	13
by	13
his	13
voice,	13
as	13
he	13
had	13
recognised	13
her.	13
Cardenio	13
also	13
heard	13
Dorothea’s	13
cry	13
as	13
she	13
fell	13
fainting,	13
and	13
imagining	13
that	13
it	13
came	13
from	13
his	13
Luscinda	13
burst	13
forth	13
in	13
terror	13
from	13
the	13
room,	13
and	13
the	13
first	13
thing	13
he	13
saw	13
was	13
Don	13
Fernando	13
with	13
Luscinda	13
in	13
his	13
arms.	13
Don	13
Fernando,	13
too,	13
knew	13
Cardenio	13
at	13
once;	13
and	13
all	13
three,	13
Luscinda,	13
Cardenio,	13
and	13
Dorothea,	13
stood	13
in	13
silent	13
amazement	13
scarcely	13
knowing	13
what	13
had	13
happened	13
to	13
them.	13
They	13
gazed	13
at	13
one	13
another	13
without	13
speaking,	13
Dorothea	13
at	13
Don	13
Fernando,	13
Don	13
Fernando	13
at	13
Cardenio,	13
Cardenio	13
at	13
Luscinda,	13
and	13
Luscinda	13
at	13
Cardenio.	13
The	13
first	13
to	13
break	13
silence	13
was	13
Luscinda,	13
who	13
thus	13
addressed	13
Don	13
Fernando:	13
“Leave	13
me,	13
Señor	13
Don	13
Fernando,	13
for	13
the	13
sake	13
of	13
what	13
you	13
owe	13
to	13
yourself;	13
if	13
no	13
other	13
reason	13
will	13
induce	13
you,	13
leave	13
me	13
to	13
cling	13
to	13
the	13
wall	13
of	13
which	13
I	13
am	13
the	13
ivy,	13
to	13
the	13
support	13
from	13
which	13
neither	13
your	13
importunities,	13
nor	13
your	13
threats,	13
nor	13
your	13
promises,	13
nor	13
your	13
gifts	13
have	13
been	13
able	13
to	13
detach	13
me.	13
See	13
how	13
Heaven,	13
by	13
ways	13
strange	13
and	13
hidden	13
from	13
our	13
sight,	13
has	13
brought	13
me	13
face	13
to	13
face	13
with	13
my	13
true	13
husband;	13
and	13
well	13
you	13
know	13
by	13
dear-bought	13
experience	13
that	13
death	13
alone	13
will	13
be	13
able	13
to	13
efface	13
him	13
from	13
my	13
memory.	13
May	13
this	13
plain	13
declaration,	13
then,	13
lead	13
you,	13
as	13
you	13
can	13
do	13
nothing	13
else,	13
to	13
turn	13
your	13
love	13
into	13
rage,	13
your	13
affection	13
into	13
resentment,	13
and	13
so	13
to	13
take	13
my	13
life;	13
for	13
if	13
I	13
yield	13
it	13
up	13
in	13
the	13
presence	13
of	13
my	13
beloved	13
husband	13
I	13
count	13
it	13
well	13
bestowed;	13
it	13
may	13
be	13
by	13
my	13
death	13
he	13
will	13
be	13
convinced	13
that	13
I	13
kept	13
my	13
faith	13
to	13
him	13
to	13
the	13
last	13
moment	13
of	13
life.”	13
Meanwhile	13
Dorothea	13
had	13
come	13
to	13
herself,	13
and	13
had	13
heard	13
Luscinda’s	13
words,	13
by	13
means	13
of	13
which	13
she	13
divined	13
who	13
she	13
was;	13
but	13
seeing	13
that	13
Don	13
Fernando	13
did	13
not	13
yet	13
release	13
her	13
or	13
reply	13
to	13
her,	13
summoning	13
up	13
her	13
resolution	13
as	13
well	13
as	13
she	13
could	13
she	13
rose	13
and	13
knelt	13
at	13
his	13
feet,	13
and	13
with	13
a	13
flood	13
of	13
bright	13
and	13
touching	13
tears	13
addressed	13
him	13
thus:	13
“If,	13
my	13
lord,	13
the	13
beams	13
of	13
that	13
sun	13
that	13
thou	13
holdest	13
eclipsed	13
in	13
thine	13
arms	13
did	13
not	13
dazzle	13
and	13
rob	13
thine	13
eyes	13
of	13
sight	13
thou	13
wouldst	13
have	13
seen	13
by	13
this	13
time	13
that	13
she	13
who	13
kneels	13
at	13
thy	13
feet	13
is,	13
so	13
long	13
as	13
thou	13
wilt	13
have	13
it	13
so,	13
the	13
unhappy	13
and	13
unfortunate	13
Dorothea.	13
I	13
am	13
that	13
lowly	13
peasant	13
girl	13
whom	13
thou	13
in	13
thy	13
goodness	13
or	13
for	13
thy	13
pleasure	13
wouldst	13
raise	13
high	13
enough	13
to	13
call	13
herself	13
thine;	13
I	13
am	13
she	13
who	13
in	13
the	13
seclusion	13
of	13
innocence	13
led	13
a	13
contented	13
life	13
until	13
at	13
the	13
voice	13
of	13
thy	13
importunity,	13
and	13
thy	13
true	13
and	13
tender	13
passion,	13
as	13
it	13
seemed,	13
she	13
opened	13
the	13
gates	13
of	13
her	13
modesty	13
and	13
surrendered	13
to	13
thee	13
the	13
keys	13
of	13
her	13
liberty;	13
a	13
gift	13
received	13
by	13
thee	13
but	13
thanklessly,	13
as	13
is	13
clearly	13
shown	13
by	13
my	13
forced	13
retreat	13
to	13
the	13
place	13
where	13
thou	13
dost	13
find	13
me,	13
and	13
by	13
thy	13
appearance	13
under	13
the	13
circumstances	13
in	13
which	13
I	13
see	13
thee.	13
Nevertheless,	13
I	13
would	13
not	13
have	13
thee	13
suppose	13
that	13
I	13
have	13
come	13
here	13
driven	13
by	13
my	13
shame;	13
it	13
is	13
only	13
grief	13
and	13
sorrow	13
at	13
seeing	13
myself	13
forgotten	13
by	13
thee	13
that	13
have	13
led	13
me.	13
It	13
was	13
thy	13
will	13
to	13
make	13
me	13
thine,	13
and	13
thou	13
didst	13
so	13
follow	13
thy	13
will,	13
that	13
now,	13
even	13
though	13
thou	13
repentest,	13
thou	13
canst	13
not	13
help	13
being	13
mine.	13
Bethink	13
thee,	13
my	13
lord,	13
the	13
unsurpassable	13
affection	13
I	13
bear	13
thee	13
may	13
compensate	13
for	13
the	13
beauty	13
and	13
noble	13
birth	13
for	13
which	13
thou	13
wouldst	13
desert	13
me.	13
Thou	13
canst	13
not	13
be	13
the	13
fair	13
Luscinda’s	13
because	13
thou	13
art	13
mine,	13
nor	13
can	13
she	13
be	13
thine	13
because	13
she	13
is	13
Cardenio’s;	13
and	13
it	13
will	13
be	13
easier,	13
remember,	13
to	13
bend	13
thy	13
will	13
to	13
love	13
one	13
who	13
adores	13
thee,	13
than	13
to	13
lead	13
one	13
to	13
love	13
thee	13
who	13
abhors	13
thee	13
now.	13
Thou	13
didst	13
address	13
thyself	13
to	13
my	13
simplicity,	13
thou	13
didst	13
lay	13
siege	13
to	13
my	13
virtue,	13
thou	13
wert	13
not	13
ignorant	13
of	13
my	13
station,	13
well	13
dost	13
thou	13
know	13
how	13
I	13
yielded	13
wholly	13
to	13
thy	13
will;	13
there	13
is	13
no	13
ground	13
or	13
reason	13
for	13
thee	13
to	13
plead	13
deception,	13
and	13
if	13
it	13
be	13
so,	13
as	13
it	13
is,	13
and	13
if	13
thou	13
art	13
a	13
Christian	13
as	13
thou	13
art	13
a	13
gentleman,	13
why	13
dost	13
thou	13
by	13
such	13
subterfuges	13
put	13
off	13
making	13
me	13
as	13
happy	13
at	13
last	13
as	13
thou	13
didst	13
at	13
first?	13
And	13
if	13
thou	13
wilt	13
not	13
have	13
me	13
for	13
what	13
I	13
am,	13
thy	13
true	13
and	13
lawful	13
wife,	13
at	13
least	13
take	13
and	13
accept	13
me	13
as	13
thy	13
slave,	13
for	13
so	13
long	13
as	13
I	13
am	13
thine	13
I	13
will	13
count	13
myself	13
happy	13
and	13
fortunate.	13
Do	13
not	13
by	13
deserting	13
me	13
let	13
my	13
shame	13
become	13
the	13
talk	13
of	13
the	13
gossips	13
in	13
the	13
streets;	13
make	13
not	13
the	13
old	13
age	13
of	13
my	13
parents	13
miserable;	13
for	13
the	13
loyal	13
services	13
they	13
as	13
faithful	13
vassals	13
have	13
ever	13
rendered	13
thine	13
are	13
not	13
deserving	13
of	13
such	13
a	13
return;	13
and	13
if	13
thou	13
thinkest	13
it	13
will	13
debase	13
thy	13
blood	13
to	13
mingle	13
it	13
with	13
mine,	13
reflect	13
that	13
there	13
is	13
little	13
or	13
no	13
nobility	13
in	13
the	13
world	13
that	13
has	13
not	13
travelled	13
the	13
same	13
road,	13
and	13
that	13
in	13
illustrious	13
lineages	13
it	13
is	13
not	13
the	13
woman’s	13
blood	13
that	13
is	13
of	13
account;	13
and,	13
moreover,	13
that	13
true	13
nobility	13
consists	13
in	13
virtue,	13
and	13
if	13
thou	13
art	13
wanting	13
in	13
that,	13
refusing	13
me	13
what	13
in	13
justice	13
thou	13
owest	13
me,	13
then	13
even	13
I	13
have	13
higher	13
claims	13
to	13
nobility	13
than	13
thine.	13
To	13
make	13
an	13
end,	13
señor,	13
these	13
are	13
my	13
last	13
words	13
to	13
thee:	13
whether	13
thou	13
wilt,	13
or	13
wilt	13
not,	13
I	13
am	13
thy	13
wife;	13
witness	13
thy	13
words,	13
which	13
must	13
not	13
and	13
ought	13
not	13
to	13
be	13
false,	13
if	13
thou	13
dost	13
pride	13
thyself	13
on	13
that	13
for	13
want	13
of	13
which	13
thou	13
scornest	13
me;	13
witness	13
the	13
pledge	13
which	13
thou	13
didst	13
give	13
me,	13
and	13
witness	13
Heaven,	13
which	13
thou	13
thyself	13
didst	13
call	13
to	13
witness	13
the	13
promise	13
thou	13
hadst	13
made	13
me;	13
and	13
if	13
all	13
this	13
fail,	13
thy	13
own	13
conscience	13
will	13
not	13
fail	13
to	13
lift	13
up	13
its	13
silent	13
voice	13
in	13
the	13
midst	13
of	13
all	13
thy	13
gaiety,	13
and	13
vindicate	13
the	13
truth	13
of	13
what	13
I	13
say	13
and	13
mar	13
thy	13
highest	13
pleasure	13
and	13
enjoyment.”	13
All	13
this	13
and	13
more	13
the	13
injured	13
Dorothea	13
delivered	13
with	13
such	13
earnest	13
feeling	13
and	13
such	13
tears	13
that	13
all	13
present,	13
even	13
those	13
who	13
came	13
with	13
Don	13
Fernando,	13
were	13
constrained	13
to	13
join	13
her	13
in	13
them.	13
Don	13
Fernando	13
listened	13
to	13
her	13
without	13
replying,	13
until,	13
ceasing	13
to	13
speak,	13
she	13
gave	13
way	13
to	13
such	13
sobs	13
and	13
sighs	13
that	13
it	13
must	13
have	13
been	13
a	13
heart	13
of	13
brass	13
that	13
was	13
not	13
softened	13
by	13
the	13
sight	13
of	13
so	13
great	13
sorrow.	13
Luscinda	13
stood	13
regarding	13
her	13
with	13
no	13
less	13
compassion	13
for	13
her	13
sufferings	13
than	13
admiration	13
for	13
her	13
intelligence	13
and	13
beauty,	13
and	13
would	13
have	13
gone	13
to	13
her	13
to	13
say	13
some	13
words	13
of	13
comfort	13
to	13
her,	13
but	13
was	13
prevented	13
by	13
Don	13
Fernando’s	13
grasp	13
which	13
held	13
her	13
fast.	13
He,	13
overwhelmed	13
with	13
confusion	13
and	13
astonishment,	13
after	13
regarding	13
Dorothea	13
for	13
some	13
moments	13
with	13
a	13
fixed	13
gaze,	13
opened	13
his	13
arms,	13
and,	13
releasing	13
Luscinda,	13
exclaimed:	13
“Thou	13
hast	13
conquered,	13
fair	13
Dorothea,	13
thou	13
hast	13
conquered,	13
for	13
it	13
is	13
impossible	13
to	13
have	13
the	13
heart	13
to	13
deny	13
the	13
united	13
force	13
of	13
so	13
many	13
truths.”	13
Luscinda	13
in	13
her	13
feebleness	13
was	13
on	13
the	13
point	13
of	13
falling	13
to	13
the	13
ground	13
when	13
Don	13
Fernando	13
released	13
her,	13
but	13
Cardenio,	13
who	13
stood	13
near,	13
having	13
retreated	13
behind	13
Don	13
Fernando	13
to	13
escape	13
recognition,	13
casting	13
fear	13
aside	13
and	13
regardless	13
of	13
what	13
might	13
happen,	13
ran	13
forward	13
to	13
support	13
her,	13
and	13
said	13
as	13
he	13
clasped	13
her	13
in	13
his	13
arms,	13
“If	13
Heaven	13
in	13
its	13
compassion	13
is	13
willing	13
to	13
let	13
thee	13
rest	13
at	13
last,	13
mistress	13
of	13
my	13
heart,	13
true,	13
constant,	13
and	13
fair,	13
nowhere	13
canst	13
thou	13
rest	13
more	13
safely	13
than	13
in	13
these	13
arms	13
that	13
now	13
receive	13
thee,	13
and	13
received	13
thee	13
before	13
when	13
fortune	13
permitted	13
me	13
to	13
call	13
thee	13
mine.”	13
At	13
these	13
words	13
Luscinda	13
looked	13
up	13
at	13
Cardenio,	13
at	13
first	13
beginning	13
to	13
recognise	13
him	13
by	13
his	13
voice	13
and	13
then	13
satisfying	13
herself	13
by	13
her	13
eyes	13
that	13
it	13
was	13
he,	13
and	13
hardly	13
knowing	13
what	13
she	13
did,	13
and	13
heedless	13
of	13
all	13
considerations	13
of	13
decorum,	13
she	13
flung	13
her	13
arms	13
around	13
his	13
neck	13
and	13
pressing	13
her	13
face	13
close	13
to	13
his,	13
said,	13
“Yes,	13
my	13
dear	13
lord,	13
you	13
are	13
the	13
true	13
master	13
of	13
this	13
your	13
slave,	13
even	13
though	13
adverse	13
fate	13
interpose	13
again,	13
and	13
fresh	13
dangers	13
threaten	13
this	13
life	13
that	13
hangs	13
on	13
yours.”	13
A	13
strange	13
sight	13
was	13
this	13
for	13
Don	13
Fernando	13
and	13
those	13
that	13
stood	13
around,	13
filled	13
with	13
surprise	13
at	13
an	13
incident	13
so	13
unlooked	13
for.	13
Dorothea	13
fancied	13
that	13
Don	13
Fernando	13
changed	13
colour	13
and	13
looked	13
as	13
though	13
he	13
meant	13
to	13
take	13
vengeance	13
on	13
Cardenio,	13
for	13
she	13
observed	13
him	13
put	13
his	13
hand	13
to	13
his	13
sword;	13
and	13
the	13
instant	13
the	13
idea	13
struck	13
her,	13
with	13
wonderful	13
quickness	13
she	13
clasped	13
him	13
round	13
the	13
knees,	13
and	13
kissing	13
them	13
and	13
holding	13
him	13
so	13
as	13
to	13
prevent	13
his	13
moving,	13
she	13
said,	13
while	13
her	13
tears	13
continued	13
to	13
flow,	13
“What	13
is	13
it	13
thou	13
wouldst	13
do,	13
my	13
only	13
refuge,	13
in	13
this	13
unforeseen	13
event?	13
Thou	13
hast	13
thy	13
wife	13
at	13
thy	13
feet,	13
and	13
she	13
whom	13
thou	13
wouldst	13
have	13
for	13
thy	13
wife	13
is	13
in	13
the	13
arms	13
of	13
her	13
husband:	13
reflect	13
whether	13
it	13
will	13
be	13
right	13
for	13
thee,	13
whether	13
it	13
will	13
be	13
possible	13
for	13
thee	13
to	13
undo	13
what	13
Heaven	13
has	13
done,	13
or	13
whether	13
it	13
will	13
be	13
becoming	13
in	13
thee	13
to	13
seek	13
to	13
raise	13
her	13
to	13
be	13
thy	13
mate	13
who	13
in	13
spite	13
of	13
every	13
obstacle,	13
and	13
strong	13
in	13
her	13
truth	13
and	13
constancy,	13
is	13
before	13
thine	13
eyes,	13
bathing	13
with	13
the	13
tears	13
of	13
love	13
the	13
face	13
and	13
bosom	13
of	13
her	13
lawful	13
husband.	13
For	13
God’s	13
sake	13
I	13
entreat	13
of	13
thee,	13
for	13
thine	13
own	13
I	13
implore	13
thee,	13
let	13
not	13
this	13
open	13
manifestation	13
rouse	13
thy	13
anger;	13
but	13
rather	13
so	13
calm	13
it	13
as	13
to	13
allow	13
these	13
two	13
lovers	13
to	13
live	13
in	13
peace	13
and	13
quiet	13
without	13
any	13
interference	13
from	13
thee	13
so	13
long	13
as	13
Heaven	13
permits	13
them;	13
and	13
in	13
so	13
doing	13
thou	13
wilt	13
prove	13
the	13
generosity	13
of	13
thy	13
lofty	13
noble	13
spirit,	13
and	13
the	13
world	13
shall	13
see	13
that	13
with	13
thee	13
reason	13
has	13
more	13
influence	13
than	13
passion.”	13
All	13
the	13
time	13
Dorothea	13
was	13
speaking,	13
Cardenio,	13
though	13
he	13
held	13
Luscinda	13
in	13
his	13
arms,	13
never	13
took	13
his	13
eyes	13
off	13
Don	13
Fernando,	13
determined,	13
if	13
he	13
saw	13
him	13
make	13
any	13
hostile	13
movement,	13
to	13
try	13
and	13
defend	13
himself	13
and	13
resist	13
as	13
best	13
he	13
could	13
all	13
who	13
might	13
assail	13
him,	13
though	13
it	13
should	13
cost	13
him	13
his	13
life.	13
But	13
now	13
Don	13
Fernando’s	13
friends,	13
as	13
well	13
as	13
the	13
curate	13
and	13
the	13
barber,	13
who	13
had	13
been	13
present	13
all	13
the	13
while,	13
not	13
forgetting	13
the	13
worthy	13
Sancho	13
Panza,	13
ran	13
forward	13
and	13
gathered	13
round	13
Don	13
Fernando,	13
entreating	13
him	13
to	13
have	13
regard	13
for	13
the	13
tears	13
of	13
Dorothea,	13
and	13
not	13
suffer	13
her	13
reasonable	13
hopes	13
to	13
be	13
disappointed,	13
since,	13
as	13
they	13
firmly	13
believed,	13
what	13
she	13
said	13
was	13
but	13
the	13
truth;	13
and	13
bidding	13
him	13
observe	13
that	13
it	13
was	13
not,	13
as	13
it	13
might	13
seem,	13
by	13
accident,	13
but	13
by	13
a	13
special	13
disposition	13
of	13
Providence	13
that	13
they	13
had	13
all	13
met	13
in	13
a	13
place	13
where	13
no	13
one	13
could	13
have	13
expected	13
a	13
meeting.	13
And	13
the	13
curate	13
bade	13
him	13
remember	13
that	13
only	13
death	13
could	13
part	13
Luscinda	13
from	13
Cardenio;	13
that	13
even	13
if	13
some	13
sword	13
were	13
to	13
separate	13
them	13
they	13
would	13
think	13
their	13
death	13
most	13
happy;	13
and	13
that	13
in	13
a	13
case	13
that	13
admitted	13
of	13
no	13
remedy	13
his	13
wisest	13
course	13
was,	13
by	13
conquering	13
and	13
putting	13
a	13
constraint	13
upon	13
himself,	13
to	13
show	13
a	13
generous	13
mind,	13
and	13
of	13
his	13
own	13
accord	13
suffer	13
these	13
two	13
to	13
enjoy	13
the	13
happiness	13
Heaven	13
had	13
granted	13
them.	13
He	13
bade	13
him,	13
too,	13
turn	13
his	13
eyes	13
upon	13
the	13
beauty	13
of	13
Dorothea	13
and	13
he	13
would	13
see	13
that	13
few	13
if	13
any	13
could	13
equal	13
much	13
less	13
excel	13
her;	13
while	13
to	13
that	13
beauty	13
should	13
be	13
added	13
her	13
modesty	13
and	13
the	13
surpassing	13
love	13
she	13
bore	13
him.	13
But	13
besides	13
all	13
this,	13
he	13
reminded	13
him	13
that	13
if	13
he	13
prided	13
himself	13
on	13
being	13
a	13
gentleman	13
and	13
a	13
Christian,	13
he	13
could	13
not	13
do	13
otherwise	13
than	13
keep	13
his	13
plighted	13
word;	13
and	13
that	13
in	13
doing	13
so	13
he	13
would	13
obey	13
God	13
and	13
meet	13
the	13
approval	13
of	13
all	13
sensible	13
people,	13
who	13
know	13
and	13
recognised	13
it	13
to	13
be	13
the	13
privilege	13
of	13
beauty,	13
even	13
in	13
one	13
of	13
humble	13
birth,	13
provided	13
virtue	13
accompany	13
it,	13
to	13
be	13
able	13
to	13
raise	13
itself	13
to	13
the	13
level	13
of	13
any	13
rank,	13
without	13
any	13
slur	13
upon	13
him	13
who	13
places	13
it	13
upon	13
an	13
equality	13
with	13
himself;	13
and	13
furthermore	13
that	13
when	13
the	13
potent	13
sway	13
of	13
passion	13
asserts	13
itself,	13
so	13
long	13
as	13
there	13
be	13
no	13
mixture	13
of	13
sin	13
in	13
it,	13
he	13
is	13
not	13
to	13
be	13
blamed	13
who	13
gives	13
way	13
to	13
it.	13
To	13
be	13
brief,	13
they	13
added	13
to	13
these	13
such	13
other	13
forcible	13
arguments	13
that	13
Don	13
Fernando’s	13
manly	13
heart,	13
being	13
after	13
all	13
nourished	13
by	13
noble	13
blood,	13
was	13
touched,	13
and	13
yielded	13
to	13
the	13
truth	13
which,	13
even	13
had	13
he	13
wished	13
it,	13
he	13
could	13
not	13
gainsay;	13
and	13
he	13
showed	13
his	13
submission,	13
and	13
acceptance	13
of	13
the	13
good	13
advice	13
that	13
had	13
been	13
offered	13
to	13
him,	13
by	13
stooping	13
down	13
and	13
embracing	13
Dorothea,	13
saying	13
to	13
her,	13
“Rise,	13
dear	13
lady,	13
it	13
is	13
not	13
right	13
that	13
what	13
I	13
hold	13
in	13
my	13
heart	13
should	13
be	13
kneeling	13
at	13
my	13
feet;	13
and	13
if	13
until	13
now	13
I	13
have	13
shown	13
no	13
sign	13
of	13
what	13
I	13
own,	13
it	13
may	13
have	13
been	13
by	13
Heaven’s	13
decree	13
in	13
order	13
that,	13
seeing	13
the	13
constancy	13
with	13
which	13
you	13
love	13
me,	13
I	13
may	13
learn	13
to	13
value	13
you	13
as	13
you	13
deserve.	13
What	13
I	13
entreat	13
of	13
you	13
is	13
that	13
you	13
reproach	13
me	13
not	13
with	13
my	13
transgression	13
and	13
grievous	13
wrong-doing;	13
for	13
the	13
same	13
cause	13
and	13
force	13
that	13
drove	13
me	13
to	13
make	13
you	13
mine	13
impelled	13
me	13
to	13
struggle	13
against	13
being	13
yours;	13
and	13
to	13
prove	13
this,	13
turn	13
and	13
look	13
at	13
the	13
eyes	13
of	13
the	13
now	13
happy	13
Luscinda,	13
and	13
you	13
will	13
see	13
in	13
them	13
an	13
excuse	13
for	13
all	13
my	13
errors:	13
and	13
as	13
she	13
has	13
found	13
and	13
gained	13
the	13
object	13
of	13
her	13
desires,	13
and	13
I	13
have	13
found	13
in	13
you	13
what	13
satisfies	13
all	13
my	13
wishes,	13
may	13
she	13
live	13
in	13
peace	13
and	13
contentment	13
as	13
many	13
happy	13
years	13
with	13
her	13
Cardenio,	13
as	13
on	13
my	13
knees	13
I	13
pray	13
Heaven	13
to	13
allow	13
me	13
to	13
live	13
with	13
my	13
Dorothea;”	13
and	13
with	13
these	13
words	13
he	13
once	13
more	13
embraced	13
her	13
and	13
pressed	13
his	13
face	13
to	13
hers	13
with	13
so	13
much	13
tenderness	13
that	13
he	13
had	13
to	13
take	13
great	13
heed	13
to	13
keep	13
his	13
tears	13
from	13
completing	13
the	13
proof	13
of	13
his	13
love	13
and	13
repentance	13
in	13
the	13
sight	13
of	13
all.	13
Not	13
so	13
Luscinda,	13
and	13
Cardenio,	13
and	13
almost	13
all	13
the	13
others,	13
for	13
they	13
shed	13
so	13
many	13
tears,	13
some	13
in	13
their	13
own	13
happiness,	13
some	13
at	13
that	13
of	13
the	13
others,	13
that	13
one	13
would	13
have	13
supposed	13
a	13
heavy	13
calamity	13
had	13
fallen	13
upon	13
them	13
all.	13
Even	13
Sancho	13
Panza	13
was	13
weeping;	13
though	13
afterwards	13
he	13
said	13
he	13
only	13
wept	13
because	13
he	13
saw	13
that	13
Dorothea	13
was	13
not	13
as	13
he	13
fancied	13
the	13
queen	13
Micomicona,	13
of	13
whom	13
he	13
expected	13
such	13
great	13
favours.	13
Their	13
wonder	13
as	13
well	13
as	13
their	13
weeping	13
lasted	13
some	13
time,	13
and	13
then	13
Cardenio	13
and	13
Luscinda	13
went	13
and	13
fell	13
on	13
their	13
knees	13
before	13
Don	13
Fernando,	13
returning	13
him	13
thanks	13
for	13
the	13
favour	13
he	13
had	13
rendered	13
them	13
in	13
language	13
so	13
grateful	13
that	13
he	13
knew	13
not	13
how	13
to	13
answer	13
them,	13
and	13
raising	13
them	13
up	13
embraced	13
them	13
with	13
every	13
mark	13
of	13
affection	13
and	13
courtesy.	13
He	13
then	13
asked	13
Dorothea	13
how	13
she	13
had	13
managed	13
to	13
reach	13
a	13
place	13
so	13
far	13
removed	13
from	13
her	13
own	13
home,	13
and	13
she	13
in	13
a	13
few	13
fitting	13
words	13
told	13
all	13
that	13
she	13
had	13
previously	13
related	13
to	13
Cardenio,	13
with	13
which	13
Don	13
Fernando	13
and	13
his	13
companions	13
were	13
so	13
delighted	13
that	13
they	13
wished	13
the	13
story	13
had	13
been	13
longer;	13
so	13
charmingly	13
did	13
Dorothea	13
describe	13
her	13
misadventures.	13
When	13
she	13
had	13
finished	13
Don	13
Fernando	13
recounted	13
what	13
had	13
befallen	13
him	13
in	13
the	13
city	13
after	13
he	13
had	13
found	13
in	13
Luscinda’s	13
bosom	13
the	13
paper	13
in	13
which	13
she	13
declared	13
that	13
she	13
was	13
Cardenio’s	13
wife,	13
and	13
never	13
could	13
be	13
his.	13
He	13
said	13
he	13
meant	13
to	13
kill	13
her,	13
and	13
would	13
have	13
done	13
so	13
had	13
he	13
not	13
been	13
prevented	13
by	13
her	13
parents,	13
and	13
that	13
he	13
quitted	13
the	13
house	13
full	13
of	13
rage	13
and	13
shame,	13
and	13
resolved	13
to	13
avenge	13
himself	13
when	13
a	13
more	13
convenient	13
opportunity	13
should	13
offer.	13
The	13
next	13
day	13
he	13
learned	13
that	13
Luscinda	13
had	13
disappeared	13
from	13
her	13
father’s	13
house,	13
and	13
that	13
no	13
one	13
could	13
tell	13
whither	13
she	13
had	13
gone.	13
Finally,	13
at	13
the	13
end	13
of	13
some	13
months	13
he	13
ascertained	13
that	13
she	13
was	13
in	13
a	13
convent	13
and	13
meant	13
to	13
remain	13
there	13
all	13
the	13
rest	13
of	13
her	13
life,	13
if	13
she	13
were	13
not	13
to	13
share	13
it	13
with	13
Cardenio;	13
and	13
as	13
soon	13
as	13
he	13
had	13
learned	13
this,	13
taking	13
these	13
three	13
gentlemen	13
as	13
his	13
companions,	13
he	13
arrived	13
at	13
the	13
place	13
where	13
she	13
was,	13
but	13
avoided	13
speaking	13
to	13
her,	13
fearing	13
that	13
if	13
it	13
were	13
known	13
he	13
was	13
there	13
stricter	13
precautions	13
would	13
be	13
taken	13
in	13
the	13
convent;	13
and	13
watching	13
a	13
time	13
when	13
the	13
porter’s	13
lodge	13
was	13
open	13
he	13
left	13
two	13
to	13
guard	13
the	13
gate,	13
and	13
he	13
and	13
the	13
other	13
entered	13
the	13
convent	13
in	13
quest	13
of	13
Luscinda,	13
whom	13
they	13
found	13
in	13
the	13
cloisters	13
in	13
conversation	13
with	13
one	13
of	13
the	13
nuns,	13
and	13
carrying	13
her	13
off	13
without	13
giving	13
her	13
time	13
to	13
resist,	13
they	13
reached	13
a	13
place	13
with	13
her	13
where	13
they	13
provided	13
themselves	13
with	13
what	13
they	13
required	13
for	13
taking	13
her	13
away;	13
all	13
which	13
they	13
were	13
able	13
to	13
do	13
in	13
complete	13
safety,	13
as	13
the	13
convent	13
was	13
in	13
the	13
country	13
at	13
a	13
considerable	13
distance	13
from	13
the	13
city.	13
He	13
added	13
that	13
when	13
Luscinda	13
found	13
herself	13
in	13
his	13
power	13
she	13
lost	13
all	13
consciousness,	13
and	13
after	13
returning	13
to	13
herself	13
did	13
nothing	13
but	13
weep	13
and	13
sigh	13
without	13
speaking	13
a	13
word;	13
and	13
thus	13
in	13
silence	13
and	13
tears	13
they	13
reached	13
that	13
inn,	13
which	13
for	13
him	13
was	13
reaching	13
heaven	13
where	13
all	13
the	13
mischances	13
of	13
earth	13
are	13
over	13
and	13
at	13
an	13
end.	13

To	13
all	13
this	13
Sancho	13
listened	13
with	13
no	13
little	13
sorrow	13
at	13
heart	13
to	13
see	13
how	13
his	13
hopes	13
of	13
dignity	13
were	13
fading	13
away	13
and	13
vanishing	13
in	13
smoke,	13
and	13
how	13
the	13
fair	13
Princess	13
Micomicona	13
had	13
turned	13
into	13
Dorothea,	13
and	13
the	13
giant	13
into	13
Don	13
Fernando,	13
while	13
his	13
master	13
was	13
sleeping	13
tranquilly,	13
totally	13
unconscious	13
of	13
all	13
that	13
had	13
come	13
to	13
pass.	13
Dorothea	13
was	13
unable	13
to	13
persuade	13
herself	13
that	13
her	13
present	13
happiness	13
was	13
not	13
all	13
a	13
dream;	13
Cardenio	13
was	13
in	13
a	13
similar	13
state	13
of	13
mind,	13
and	13
Luscinda’s	13
thoughts	13
ran	13
in	13
the	13
same	13
direction.	13
Don	13
Fernando	13
gave	13
thanks	13
to	13
Heaven	13
for	13
the	13
favour	13
shown	13
to	13
him	13
and	13
for	13
having	13
been	13
rescued	13
from	13
the	13
intricate	13
labyrinth	13
in	13
which	13
he	13
had	13
been	13
brought	13
so	13
near	13
the	13
destruction	13
of	13
his	13
good	13
name	13
and	13
of	13
his	13
soul;	13
and	13
in	13
short	13
everybody	13
in	13
the	13
inn	13
was	13
full	13
of	13
contentment	13
and	13
satisfaction	13
at	13
the	13
happy	13
issue	13
of	13
such	13
a	13
complicated	13
and	13
hopeless	13
business.	13
The	13
curate	13
as	13
a	13
sensible	13
man	13
made	13
sound	13
reflections	13
upon	13
the	13
whole	13
affair,	13
and	13
congratulated	13
each	13
upon	13
his	13
good	13
fortune;	13
but	13
the	13
one	13
that	13
was	13
in	13
the	13
highest	13
spirits	13
and	13
good	13
humour	13
was	13
the	13
landlady,	13
because	13
of	13
the	13
promise	13
Cardenio	13
and	13
the	13
curate	13
had	13
given	13
her	13
to	13
pay	13
for	13
all	13
the	13
losses	13
and	13
damage	13
she	13
had	13
sustained	13
through	13
Don	13
Quixote’s	13
means.	13
Sancho,	13
as	13
has	13
been	13
already	13
said,	13
was	13
the	13
only	13
one	13
who	13
was	13
distressed,	13
unhappy,	13
and	13
dejected;	13
and	13
so	13
with	13
a	13
long	13
face	13
he	13
went	13
in	13
to	13
his	13
master,	13
who	13
had	13
just	13
awoke,	13
and	13
said	13
to	13
him:	13
“Sir	13
Rueful	13
Countenance,	13
your	13
worship	13
may	13
as	13
well	13
sleep	13
on	13
as	13
much	13
as	13
you	13
like,	13
without	13
troubling	13
yourself	13
about	13
killing	13
any	13
giant	13
or	13
restoring	13
her	13
kingdom	13
to	13
the	13
princess;	13
for	13
that	13
is	13
all	13
over	13
and	13
settled	13
now.”	13
“I	13
should	13
think	13
it	13
was,”	13
replied	13
Don	13
Quixote,	13
“for	13
I	13
have	13
had	13
the	13
most	13
prodigious	13
and	13
stupendous	13
battle	13
with	13
the	13
giant	13
that	13
I	13
ever	13
remember	13
having	13
had	13
all	13
the	13
days	13
of	13
my	13
life;	13
and	13
with	13
one	13
back-stroke—swish!—I	13
brought	13
his	13
head	13
tumbling	13
to	13
the	13
ground,	13
and	13
so	13
much	13
blood	13
gushed	13
forth	13
from	13
him	13
that	13
it	13
ran	13
in	13
rivulets	13
over	13
the	13
earth	13
like	13
water.”	13
“Like	13
red	13
wine,	13
your	13
worship	13
had	13
better	13
say,”	13
replied	13
Sancho;	13
“for	13
I	13
would	13
have	13
you	13
know,	13
if	13
you	13
don’t	13
know	13
it,	13
that	13
the	13
dead	13
giant	13
is	13
a	13
hacked	13
wine-skin,	13
and	13
the	13
blood	13
four-and-twenty	13
gallons	13
of	13
red	13
wine	13
that	13
it	13
had	13
in	13
its	13
belly,	13
and	13
the	13
cut-off	13
head	13
is	13
the	13
bitch	13
that	13
bore	13
me;	13
and	13
the	13
devil	13
take	13
it	13
all.”	13
“What	13
art	13
thou	13
talking	13
about,	13
fool?”	13
said	13
Don	13
Quixote;	13
“art	13
thou	13
in	13
thy	13
senses?”	13
“Let	13
your	13
worship	13
get	13
up,”	13
said	13
Sancho,	13
“and	13
you	13
will	13
see	13
the	13
nice	13
business	13
you	13
have	13
made	13
of	13
it,	13
and	13
what	13
we	13
have	13
to	13
pay;	13
and	13
you	13
will	13
see	13
the	13
queen	13
turned	13
into	13
a	13
private	13
lady	13
called	13
Dorothea,	13
and	13
other	13
things	13
that	13
will	13
astonish	13
you,	13
if	13
you	13
understand	13
them.”	13
“I	13
shall	13
not	13
be	13
surprised	13
at	13
anything	13
of	13
the	13
kind,”	13
returned	13
Don	13
Quixote;	13
“for	13
if	13
thou	13
dost	13
remember	13
the	13
last	13
time	13
we	13
were	13
here	13
I	13
told	13
thee	13
that	13
everything	13
that	13
happened	13
here	13
was	13
a	13
matter	13
of	13
enchantment,	13
and	13
it	13
would	13
be	13
no	13
wonder	13
if	13
it	13
were	13
the	13
same	13
now.”	13
“I	13
could	13
believe	13
all	13
that,”	13
replied	13
Sancho,	13
“if	13
my	13
blanketing	13
was	13
the	13
same	13
sort	13
of	13
thing	13
also;	13
only	13
it	13
wasn’t,	13
but	13
real	13
and	13
genuine;	13
for	13
I	13
saw	13
the	13
landlord,	13
who	13
is	13
here	13
to-day,	13
holding	13
one	13
end	13
of	13
the	13
blanket	13
and	13
jerking	13
me	13
up	13
to	13
the	13
skies	13
very	13
neatly	13
and	13
smartly,	13
and	13
with	13
as	13
much	13
laughter	13
as	13
strength;	13
and	13
when	13
it	13
comes	13
to	13
be	13
a	13
case	13
of	13
knowing	13
people,	13
I	13
hold	13
for	13
my	13
part,	13
simple	13
and	13
sinner	13
as	13
I	13
am,	13
that	13
there	13
is	13
no	13
enchantment	13
about	13
it	13
at	13
all,	13
but	13
a	13
great	13
deal	13
of	13
bruising	13
and	13
bad	13
luck.”	13
“Well,	13
well,	13
God	13
will	13
give	13
a	13
remedy,”	13
said	13
Don	13
Quixote;	13
“hand	13
me	13
my	13
clothes	13
and	13
let	13
me	13
go	13
out,	13
for	13
I	13
want	13
to	13
see	13
these	13
transformations	13
and	13
things	13
thou	13
speakest	13
of.”	13
Sancho	13
fetched	13
him	13
his	13
clothes;	13
and	13
while	13
he	13
was	13
dressing,	13
the	13
curate	13
gave	13
Don	13
Fernando	13
and	13
the	13
others	13
present	13
an	13
account	13
of	13
Don	13
Quixote’s	13
madness	13
and	13
of	13
the	13
stratagem	13
they	13
had	13
made	13
use	13
of	13
to	13
withdraw	13
him	13
from	13
that	13
Pena	13
Pobre	13
where	13
he	13
fancied	13
himself	13
stationed	13
because	13
of	13
his	13
lady’s	13
scorn.	13
He	13
described	13
to	13
them	13
also	13
nearly	13
all	13
the	13
adventures	13
that	13
Sancho	13
had	13
mentioned,	13
at	13
which	13
they	13
marvelled	13
and	13
laughed	13
not	13
a	13
little,	13
thinking	13
it,	13
as	13
all	13
did,	13
the	13
strangest	13
form	13
of	13
madness	13
a	13
crazy	13
intellect	13
could	13
be	13
capable	13
of.	13
But	13
now,	13
the	13
curate	13
said,	13
that	13
the	13
lady	13
Dorothea’s	13
good	13
fortune	13
prevented	13
her	13
from	13
proceeding	13
with	13
their	13
purpose,	13
it	13
would	13
be	13
necessary	13
to	13
devise	13
or	13
discover	13
some	13
other	13
way	13
of	13
getting	13
him	13
home.	13
Cardenio	13
proposed	13
to	13
carry	13
out	13
the	13
scheme	13
they	13
had	13
begun,	13
and	13
suggested	13
that	13
Luscinda	13
would	13
act	13
and	13
support	13
Dorothea’s	13
part	13
sufficiently	13
well.	13
“No,”	13
said	13
Don	13
Fernando,	13
“that	13
must	13
not	13
be,	13
for	13
I	13
want	13
Dorothea	13
to	13
follow	13
out	13
this	13
idea	13
of	13
hers;	13
and	13
if	13
the	13
worthy	13
gentleman’s	13
village	13
is	13
not	13
very	13
far	13
off,	13
I	13
shall	13
be	13
happy	13
if	13
I	13
can	13
do	13
anything	13
for	13
his	13
relief.”	13
“It	13
is	13
not	13
more	13
than	13
two	13
days’	13
journey	13
from	13
this,”	13
said	13
the	13
curate.	13
“Even	13
if	13
it	13
were	13
more,”	13
said	13
Don	13
Fernando,	13
“I	13
would	13
gladly	13
travel	13
so	13
far	13
for	13
the	13
sake	13
of	13
doing	13
so	13
good	13
a	13
work.”	13
At	13
this	13
moment	13
Don	13
Quixote	13
came	13
out	13
in	13
full	13
panoply,	13
with	13
Mambrino’s	13
helmet,	13
all	13
dinted	13
as	13
it	13
was,	13
on	13
his	13
head,	13
his	13
buckler	13
on	13
his	13
arm,	13
and	13
leaning	13
on	13
his	13
staff	13
or	13
pike.	13
The	13
strange	13
figure	13
he	13
presented	13
filled	13
Don	13
Fernando	13
and	13
the	13
rest	13
with	13
amazement	13
as	13
they	13
contemplated	13
his	13
lean	13
yellow	13
face	13
half	13
a	13
league	13
long,	13
his	13
armour	13
of	13
all	13
sorts,	13
and	13
the	13
solemnity	13
of	13
his	13
deportment.	13
They	13
stood	13
silent	13
waiting	13
to	13
see	13
what	13
he	13
would	13
say,	13
and	13
he,	13
fixing	13
his	13
eyes	13
on	13
the	13
fair	13
Dorothea,	13
addressed	13
her	13
with	13
great	13
gravity	13
and	13
composure:	13
“I	13
am	13
informed,	13
fair	13
lady,	13
by	13
my	13
squire	13
here	13
that	13
your	13
greatness	13
has	13
been	13
annihilated	13
and	13
your	13
being	13
abolished,	13
since,	13
from	13
a	13
queen	13
and	13
lady	13
of	13
high	13
degree	13
as	13
you	13
used	13
to	13
be,	13
you	13
have	13
been	13
turned	13
into	13
a	13
private	13
maiden.	13
If	13
this	13
has	13
been	13
done	13
by	13
the	13
command	13
of	13
the	13
magician	13
king	13
your	13
father,	13
through	13
fear	13
that	13
I	13
should	13
not	13
afford	13
you	13
the	13
aid	13
you	13
need	13
and	13
are	13
entitled	13
to,	13
I	13
may	13
tell	13
you	13
he	13
did	13
not	13
know	13
and	13
does	13
not	13
know	13
half	13
the	13
mass,	13
and	13
was	13
little	13
versed	13
in	13
the	13
annals	13
of	13
chivalry;	13
for,	13
if	13
he	13
had	13
read	13
and	13
gone	13
through	13
them	13
as	13
attentively	13
and	13
deliberately	13
as	13
I	13
have,	13
he	13
would	13
have	13
found	13
at	13
every	13
turn	13
that	13
knights	13
of	13
less	13
renown	13
than	13
mine	13
have	13
accomplished	13
things	13
more	13
difficult:	13
it	13
is	13
no	13
great	13
matter	13
to	13
kill	13
a	13
whelp	13
of	13
a	13
giant,	13
however	13
arrogant	13
he	13
may	13
be;	13
for	13
it	13
is	13
not	13
many	13
hours	13
since	13
I	13
myself	13
was	13
engaged	13
with	13
one,	13
and—I	13
will	13
not	13
speak	13
of	13
it,	13
that	13
they	13
may	13
not	13
say	13
I	13
am	13
lying;	13
time,	13
however,	13
that	13
reveals	13
all,	13
will	13
tell	13
the	13
tale	13
when	13
we	13
least	13
expect	13
it.”	13
“You	13
were	13
engaged	13
with	13
a	13
couple	13
of	13
wine-skins,	13
and	13
not	13
a	13
giant,”	13
said	13
the	13
landlord	13
at	13
this;	13
but	13
Don	13
Fernando	13
told	13
him	13
to	13
hold	13
his	13
tongue	13
and	13
on	13
no	13
account	13
interrupt	13
Don	13
Quixote,	13
who	13
continued,	13
“I	13
say	13
in	13
conclusion,	13
high	13
and	13
disinherited	13
lady,	13
that	13
if	13
your	13
father	13
has	13
brought	13
about	13
this	13
metamorphosis	13
in	13
your	13
person	13
for	13
the	13
reason	13
I	13
have	13
mentioned,	13
you	13
ought	13
not	13
to	13
attach	13
any	13
importance	13
to	13
it;	13
for	13
there	13
is	13
no	13
peril	13
on	13
earth	13
through	13
which	13
my	13
sword	13
will	13
not	13
force	13
a	13
way,	13
and	13
with	13
it,	13
before	13
many	13
days	13
are	13
over,	13
I	13
will	13
bring	13
your	13
enemy’s	13
head	13
to	13
the	13
ground	13
and	13
place	13
on	13
yours	13
the	13
crown	13
of	13
your	13
kingdom.”	13
Don	13
Quixote	13
said	13
no	13
more,	13
and	13
waited	13
for	13
the	13
reply	13
of	13
the	13
princess,	13
who	13
aware	13
of	13
Don	13
Fernando’s	13
determination	13
to	13
carry	13
on	13
the	13
deception	13
until	13
Don	13
Quixote	13
had	13
been	13
conveyed	13
to	13
his	13
home,	13
with	13
great	13
ease	13
of	13
manner	13
and	13
gravity	13
made	13
answer,	13
“Whoever	13
told	13
you,	13
valiant	13
Knight	13
of	13
the	13
Rueful	13
Countenance,	13
that	13
I	13
had	13
undergone	13
any	13
change	13
or	13
transformation	13
did	13
not	13
tell	13
you	13
the	13
truth,	13
for	13
I	13
am	13
the	13
same	13
as	13
I	13
was	13
yesterday.	13
It	13
is	13
true	13
that	13
certain	13
strokes	13
of	13
good	13
fortune,	13
that	13
have	13
given	13
me	13
more	13
than	13
I	13
could	13
have	13
hoped	13
for,	13
have	13
made	13
some	13
alteration	13
in	13
me;	13
but	13
I	13
have	13
not	13
therefore	13
ceased	13
to	13
be	13
what	13
I	13
was	13
before,	13
or	13
to	13
entertain	13
the	13
same	13
desire	13
I	13
have	13
had	13
all	13
through	13
of	13
availing	13
myself	13
of	13
the	13
might	13
of	13
your	13
valiant	13
and	13
invincible	13
arm.	13
And	13
so,	13
señor,	13
let	13
your	13
goodness	13
reinstate	13
the	13
father	13
that	13
begot	13
me	13
in	13
your	13
good	13
opinion,	13
and	13
be	13
assured	13
that	13
he	13
was	13
a	13
wise	13
and	13
prudent	13
man,	13
since	13
by	13
his	13
craft	13
he	13
found	13
out	13
such	13
a	13
sure	13
and	13
easy	13
way	13
of	13
remedying	13
my	13
misfortune;	13
for	13
I	13
believe,	13
señor,	13
that	13
had	13
it	13
not	13
been	13
for	13
you	13
I	13
should	13
never	13
have	13
lit	13
upon	13
the	13
good	13
fortune	13
I	13
now	13
possess;	13
and	13
in	13
this	13
I	13
am	13
saying	13
what	13
is	13
perfectly	13
true;	13
as	13
most	13
of	13
these	13
gentlemen	13
who	13
are	13
present	13
can	13
fully	13
testify.	13
All	13
that	13
remains	13
is	13
to	13
set	13
out	13
on	13
our	13
journey	13
to-morrow,	13
for	13
to-day	13
we	13
could	13
not	13
make	13
much	13
way;	13
and	13
for	13
the	13
rest	13
of	13
the	13
happy	13
result	13
I	13
am	13
looking	13
forward	13
to,	13
I	13
trust	13
to	13
God	13
and	13
the	13
valour	13
of	13
your	13
heart.”	13
So	13
said	13
the	13
sprightly	13
Dorothea,	13
and	13
on	13
hearing	13
her	13
Don	13
Quixote	13
turned	13
to	13
Sancho,	13
and	13
said	13
to	13
him,	13
with	13
an	13
angry	13
air,	13
“I	13
declare	13
now,	13
little	13
Sancho,	13
thou	13
art	13
the	13
greatest	13
little	13
villain	13
in	13
Spain.	13
Say,	13
thief	13
and	13
vagabond,	13
hast	13
thou	13
not	13
just	13
now	13
told	13
me	13
that	13
this	13
princess	13
had	13
been	13
turned	13
into	13
a	13
maiden	13
called	13
Dorothea,	13
and	13
that	13
the	13
head	13
which	13
I	13
am	13
persuaded	13
I	13
cut	13
off	13
from	13
a	13
giant	13
was	13
the	13
bitch	13
that	13
bore	13
thee,	13
and	13
other	13
nonsense	13
that	13
put	13
me	13
in	13
the	13
greatest	13
perplexity	13
I	13
have	13
ever	13
been	13
in	13
all	13
my	13
life?	13
I	13
vow”	13
(and	13
here	13
he	13
looked	13
to	13
heaven	13
and	13
ground	13
his	13
teeth)	13
“I	13
have	13
a	13
mind	13
to	13
play	13
the	13
mischief	13
with	13
thee,	13
in	13
a	13
way	13
that	13
will	13
teach	13
sense	13
for	13
the	13
future	13
to	13
all	13
lying	13
squires	13
of	13
knights-errant	13
in	13
the	13
world.”	13
“Let	13
your	13
worship	13
be	13
calm,	13
señor,”	13
returned	13
Sancho,	13
“for	13
it	13
may	13
well	13
be	13
that	13
I	13
have	13
been	13
mistaken	13
as	13
to	13
the	13
change	13
of	13
the	13
lady	13
princess	13
Micomicona;	13
but	13
as	13
to	13
the	13
giant’s	13
head,	13
or	13
at	13
least	13
as	13
to	13
the	13
piercing	13
of	13
the	13
wine-skins,	13
and	13
the	13
blood	13
being	13
red	13
wine,	13
I	13
make	13
no	13
mistake,	13
as	13
sure	13
as	13
there	13
is	13
a	13
God;	13
because	13
the	13
wounded	13
skins	13
are	13
there	13
at	13
the	13
head	13
of	13
your	13
worship’s	13
bed,	13
and	13
the	13
wine	13
has	13
made	13
a	13
lake	13
of	13
the	13
room;	13
if	13
not	13
you	13
will	13
see	13
when	13
the	13
eggs	13
come	13
to	13
be	13
fried;	13
I	13
mean	13
when	13
his	13
worship	13
the	13
landlord	13
calls	13
for	13
all	13
the	13
damages:	13
for	13
the	13
rest,	13
I	13
am	13
heartily	13
glad	13
that	13
her	13
ladyship	13
the	13
queen	13
is	13
as	13
she	13
was,	13
for	13
it	13
concerns	13
me	13
as	13
much	13
as	13
anyone.”	13
“I	13
tell	13
thee	13
again,	13
Sancho,	13
thou	13
art	13
a	13
fool,”	13
said	13
Don	13
Quixote;	13
“forgive	13
me,	13
and	13
that	13
will	13
do.”	13
“That	13
will	13
do,”	13
said	13
Don	13
Fernando;	13
“let	13
us	13
say	13
no	13
more	13
about	13
it;	13
and	13
as	13
her	13
ladyship	13
the	13
princess	13
proposes	13
to	13
set	13
out	13
to-morrow	13
because	13
it	13
is	13
too	13
late	13
to-day,	13
so	13
be	13
it,	13
and	13
we	13
will	13
pass	13
the	13
night	13
in	13
pleasant	13
conversation,	13
and	13
to-morrow	13
we	13
will	13
all	13
accompany	13
Señor	13
Don	13
Quixote;	13
for	13
we	13
wish	13
to	13
witness	13
the	13
valiant	13
and	13
unparalleled	13
achievements	13
he	13
is	13
about	13
to	13
perform	13
in	13
the	13
course	13
of	13
this	13
mighty	13
enterprise	13
which	13
he	13
has	13
undertaken.”	13
“It	13
is	13
I	13
who	13
shall	13
wait	13
upon	13
and	13
accompany	13
you,”	13
said	13
Don	13
Quixote;	13
“and	13
I	13
am	13
much	13
gratified	13
by	13
the	13
favour	13
that	13
is	13
bestowed	13
upon	13
me,	13
and	13
the	13
good	13
opinion	13
entertained	13
of	13
me,	13
which	13
I	13
shall	13
strive	13
to	13
justify	13
or	13
it	13
shall	13
cost	13
me	13
my	13
life,	13
or	13
even	13
more,	13
if	13
it	13
can	13
possibly	13
cost	13
me	13
more.”	13
Many	13
were	13
the	13
compliments	13
and	13
expressions	13
of	13
politeness	13
that	13
passed	13
between	13
Don	13
Quixote	13
and	13
Don	13
Fernando;	13
but	13
they	13
were	13
brought	13
to	13
an	13
end	13
by	13
a	13
traveller	13
who	13
at	13
this	13
moment	13
entered	13
the	13
inn,	13
and	13
who	13
seemed	13
from	13
his	13
attire	13
to	13
be	13
a	13
Christian	13
lately	13
come	13
from	13
the	13
country	13
of	13
the	13
Moors,	13
for	13
he	13
was	13
dressed	13
in	13
a	13
short-skirted	13
coat	13
of	13
blue	13
cloth	13
with	13
half-sleeves	13
and	13
without	13
a	13
collar;	13
his	13
breeches	13
were	13
also	13
of	13
blue	13
cloth,	13
and	13
his	13
cap	13
of	13
the	13
same	13
colour,	13
and	13
he	13
wore	13
yellow	13
buskins	13
and	13
had	13
a	13
Moorish	13
cutlass	13
slung	13
from	13
a	13
baldric	13
across	13
his	13
breast.	13
Behind	13
him,	13
mounted	13
upon	13
an	13
ass,	13
there	13
came	13
a	13
woman	13
dressed	13
in	13
Moorish	13
fashion,	13
with	13
her	13
face	13
veiled	13
and	13
a	13
scarf	13
on	13
her	13
head,	13
and	13
wearing	13
a	13
little	13
brocaded	13
cap,	13
and	13
a	13
mantle	13
that	13
covered	13
her	13
from	13
her	13
shoulders	13
to	13
her	13
feet.	13
The	13
man	13
was	13
of	13
a	13
robust	13
and	13
well-proportioned	13
frame,	13
in	13
age	13
a	13
little	13
over	13
forty,	13
rather	13
swarthy	13
in	13
complexion,	13
with	13
long	13
moustaches	13
and	13
a	13
full	13
beard,	13
and,	13
in	13
short,	13
his	13
appearance	13
was	13
such	13
that	13
if	13
he	13
had	13
been	13
well	13
dressed	13
he	13
would	13
have	13
been	13
taken	13
for	13
a	13
person	13
of	13
quality	13
and	13
good	13
birth.	13
On	13
entering	13
he	13
asked	13
for	13
a	13
room,	13
and	13
when	13
they	13
told	13
him	13
there	13
was	13
none	13
in	13
the	13
inn	13
he	13
seemed	13
distressed,	13
and	13
approaching	13
her	13
who	13
by	13
her	13
dress	13
seemed	13
to	13
be	13
a	13
Moor,	13
he	13
took	13
her	13
down	13
from	13
the	13
saddle	13
in	13
his	13
arms.	13
Luscinda,	13
Dorothea,	13
the	13
landlady,	13
her	13
daughter	13
and	13
Maritornes,	13
attracted	13
by	13
the	13
strange,	13
and	13
to	13
them	13
entirely	13
new	13
costume,	13
gathered	13
round	13
her;	13
and	13
Dorothea,	13
who	13
was	13
always	13
kindly,	13
courteous,	13
and	13
quick-witted,	13
perceiving	13
that	13
both	13
she	13
and	13
the	13
man	13
who	13
had	13
brought	13
her	13
were	13
annoyed	13
at	13
not	13
finding	13
a	13
room,	13
said	13
to	13
her,	13
“Do	13
not	13
be	13
put	13
out,	13
señora,	13
by	13
the	13
discomfort	13
and	13
want	13
of	13
luxuries	13
here,	13
for	13
it	13
is	13
the	13
way	13
of	13
road-side	13
inns	13
to	13
be	13
without	13
them;	13
still,	13
if	13
you	13
will	13
be	13
pleased	13
to	13
share	13
our	13
lodging	13
with	13
us	13
(pointing	13
to	13
Luscinda)	13
perhaps	13
you	13
will	13
have	13
found	13
worse	13
accommodation	13
in	13
the	13
course	13
of	13
your	13
journey.”	13
To	13
this	13
the	13
veiled	13
lady	13
made	13
no	13
reply;	13
all	13
she	13
did	13
was	13
to	13
rise	13
from	13
her	13
seat,	13
crossing	13
her	13
hands	13
upon	13
her	13
bosom,	13
bowing	13
her	13
head	13
and	13
bending	13
her	13
body	13
as	13
a	13
sign	13
that	13
she	13
returned	13
thanks.	13
From	13
her	13
silence	13
they	13
concluded	13
that	13
she	13
must	13
be	13
a	13
Moor	13
and	13
unable	13
to	13
speak	13
a	13
Christian	13
tongue.	13
At	13
this	13
moment	13
the	13
captive	13
came	13
up,	13
having	13
been	13
until	13
now	13
otherwise	13
engaged,	13
and	13
seeing	13
that	13
they	13
all	13
stood	13
round	13
his	13
companion	13
and	13
that	13
she	13
made	13
no	13
reply	13
to	13
what	13
they	13
addressed	13
to	13
her,	13
he	13
said,	13
“Ladies,	13
this	13
damsel	13
hardly	13
understands	13
my	13
language	13
and	13
can	13
speak	13
none	13
but	13
that	13
of	13
her	13
own	13
country,	13
for	13
which	13
reason	13
she	13
does	13
not	13
and	13
cannot	13
answer	13
what	13
has	13
been	13
asked	13
of	13
her.”	13
“Nothing	13
has	13
been	13
asked	13
of	13
her,”	13
returned	13
Luscinda;	13
“she	13
has	13
only	13
been	13
offered	13
our	13
company	13
for	13
this	13
evening	13
and	13
a	13
share	13
of	13
the	13
quarters	13
we	13
occupy,	13
where	13
she	13
shall	13
be	13
made	13
as	13
comfortable	13
as	13
the	13
circumstances	13
allow,	13
with	13
the	13
good-will	13
we	13
are	13
bound	13
to	13
show	13
all	13
strangers	13
that	13
stand	13
in	13
need	13
of	13
it,	13
especially	13
if	13
it	13
be	13
a	13
woman	13
to	13
whom	13
the	13
service	13
is	13
rendered.”	13
“On	13
her	13
part	13
and	13
my	13
own,	13
señora,”	13
replied	13
the	13
captive,	13
“I	13
kiss	13
your	13
hands,	13
and	13
I	13
esteem	13
highly,	13
as	13
I	13
ought,	13
the	13
favour	13
you	13
have	13
offered,	13
which,	13
on	13
such	13
an	13
occasion	13
and	13
coming	13
from	13
persons	13
of	13
your	13
appearance,	13
is,	13
it	13
is	13
plain	13
to	13
see,	13
a	13
very	13
great	13
one.”	13
“Tell	13
me,	13
señor,”	13
said	13
Dorothea,	13
“is	13
this	13
lady	13
a	13
Christian	13
or	13
a	13
Moor?	13
for	13
her	13
dress	13
and	13
her	13
silence	13
lead	13
us	13
to	13
imagine	13
that	13
she	13
is	13
what	13
we	13
could	13
wish	13
she	13
was	13
not.”	13
“In	13
dress	13
and	13
outwardly,”	13
said	13
he,	13
“she	13
is	13
a	13
Moor,	13
but	13
at	13
heart	13
she	13
is	13
a	13
thoroughly	13
good	13
Christian,	13
for	13
she	13
has	13
the	13
greatest	13
desire	13
to	13
become	13
one.”	13
“Then	13
she	13
has	13
not	13
been	13
baptised?”	13
returned	13
Luscinda.	13
“There	13
has	13
been	13
no	13
opportunity	13
for	13
that,”	13
replied	13
the	13
captive,	13
“since	13
she	13
left	13
Algiers,	13
her	13
native	13
country	13
and	13
home;	13
and	13
up	13
to	13
the	13
present	13
she	13
has	13
not	13
found	13
herself	13
in	13
any	13
such	13
imminent	13
danger	13
of	13
death	13
as	13
to	13
make	13
it	13
necessary	13
to	13
baptise	13
her	13
before	13
she	13
has	13
been	13
instructed	13
in	13
all	13
the	13
ceremonies	13
our	13
holy	13
mother	13
Church	13
ordains;	13
but,	13
please	13
God,	13
ere	13
long	13
she	13
shall	13
be	13
baptised	13
with	13
the	13
solemnity	13
befitting	13
her	13
which	13
is	13
higher	13
than	13
her	13
dress	13
or	13
mine	13
indicates.”	13
By	13
these	13
words	13
he	13
excited	13
a	13
desire	13
in	13
all	13
who	13
heard	13
him,	13
to	13
know	13
who	13
the	13
Moorish	13
lady	13
and	13
the	13
captive	13
were,	13
but	13
no	13
one	13
liked	13
to	13
ask	13
just	13
then,	13
seeing	13
that	13
it	13
was	13
a	13
fitter	13
moment	13
for	13
helping	13
them	13
to	13
rest	13
themselves	13
than	13
for	13
questioning	13
them	13
about	13
their	13
lives.	13
Dorothea	13
took	13
the	13
Moorish	13
lady	13
by	13
the	13
hand	13
and	13
leading	13
her	13
to	13
a	13
seat	13
beside	13
herself,	13
requested	13
her	13
to	13
remove	13
her	13
veil.	13
She	13
looked	13
at	13
the	13
captive	13
as	13
if	13
to	13
ask	13
him	13
what	13
they	13
meant	13
and	13
what	13
she	13
was	13
to	13
do.	13
He	13
said	13
to	13
her	13
in	13
Arabic	13
that	13
they	13
asked	13
her	13
to	13
take	13
off	13
her	13
veil,	13
and	13
thereupon	13
she	13
removed	13
it	13
and	13
disclosed	13
a	13
countenance	13
so	13
lovely,	13
that	13
to	13
Dorothea	13
she	13
seemed	13
more	13
beautiful	13
than	13
Luscinda,	13
and	13
to	13
Luscinda	13
more	13
beautiful	13
than	13
Dorothea,	13
and	13
all	13
the	13
bystanders	13
felt	13
that	13
if	13
any	13
beauty	13
could	13
compare	13
with	13
theirs	13
it	13
was	13
the	13
Moorish	13
lady’s,	13
and	13
there	13
were	13
even	13
those	13
who	13
were	13
inclined	13
to	13
give	13
it	13
somewhat	13
the	13
preference.	13
And	13
as	13
it	13
is	13
the	13
privilege	13
and	13
charm	13
of	13
beauty	13
to	13
win	13
the	13
heart	13
and	13
secure	13
good-will,	13
all	13
forthwith	13
became	13
eager	13
to	13
show	13
kindness	13
and	13
attention	13
to	13
the	13
lovely	13
Moor.	13
Don	13
Fernando	13
asked	13
the	13
captive	13
what	13
her	13
name	13
was,	13
and	13
he	13
replied	13
that	13
it	13
was	13
Lela	13
Zoraida;	13
but	13
the	13
instant	13
she	13
heard	13
him,	13
she	13
guessed	13
what	13
the	13
Christian	13
had	13
asked,	13
and	13
said	13
hastily,	13
with	13
some	13
displeasure	13
and	13
energy,	13
“No,	13
not	13
Zoraida;	13
Maria,	13
Maria!”	13
giving	13
them	13
to	13
understand	13
that	13
she	13
was	13
called	13
“Maria”	13
and	13
not	13
“Zoraida.”	13
These	13
words,	13
and	13
the	13
touching	13
earnestness	13
with	13
which	13
she	13
uttered	13
them,	13
drew	13
more	13
than	13
one	13
tear	13
from	13
some	13
of	13
the	13
listeners,	13
particularly	13
the	13
women,	13
who	13
are	13
by	13
nature	13
tender-hearted	13
and	13
compassionate.	13
Luscinda	13
embraced	13
her	13
affectionately,	13
saying,	13
“Yes,	13
yes,	13
Maria,	13
Maria,”	13
to	13
which	13
the	13
Moor	13
replied,	13
“Yes,	13
yes,	13
Maria;	13
Zoraida	13
macange,”	13
which	13
means	13
“not	13
Zoraida.”	13
Night	13
was	13
now	13
approaching,	13
and	13
by	13
the	13
orders	13
of	13
those	13
who	13
accompanied	13
Don	13
Fernando	13
the	13
landlord	13
had	13
taken	13
care	13
and	13
pains	13
to	13
prepare	13
for	13
them	13
the	13
best	13
supper	13
that	13
was	13
in	13
his	13
power.	13
The	13
hour	13
therefore	13
having	13
arrived	13
they	13
all	13
took	13
their	13
seats	13
at	13
a	13
long	13
table	13
like	13
a	13
refectory	13
one,	13
for	13
round	13
or	13
square	13
table	13
there	13
was	13
none	13
in	13
the	13
inn,	13
and	13
the	13
seat	13
of	13
honour	13
at	13
the	13
head	13
of	13
it,	13
though	13
he	13
was	13
for	13
refusing	13
it,	13
they	13
assigned	13
to	13
Don	13
Quixote,	13
who	13
desired	13
the	13
lady	13
Micomicona	13
to	13
place	13
herself	13
by	13
his	13
side,	13
as	13
he	13
was	13
her	13
protector.	13
Luscinda	13
and	13
Zoraida	13
took	13
their	13
places	13
next	13
her,	13
opposite	13
to	13
them	13
were	13
Don	13
Fernando	13
and	13
Cardenio,	13
and	13
next	13
the	13
captive	13
and	13
the	13
other	13
gentlemen,	13
and	13
by	13
the	13
side	13
of	13
the	13
ladies,	13
the	13
curate	13
and	13
the	13
barber.	13
And	13
so	13
they	13
supped	13
in	13
high	13
enjoyment,	13
which	13
was	13
increased	13
when	13
they	13
observed	13
Don	13
Quixote	13
leave	13
off	13
eating,	13
and,	13
moved	13
by	13
an	13
impulse	13
like	13
that	13
which	13
made	13
him	13
deliver	13
himself	13
at	13
such	13
length	13
when	13
he	13
supped	13
with	13
the	13
goatherds,	13
begin	13
to	13
address	13
them:	13
“Verily,	13
gentlemen,	13
if	13
we	13
reflect	13
upon	13
it,	13
great	13
and	13
marvellous	13
are	13
the	13
things	13
they	13
see,	13
who	13
make	13
profession	13
of	13
the	13
order	13
of	13
knight-errantry.	13
Say,	13
what	13
being	13
is	13
there	13
in	13
this	13
world,	13
who	13
entering	13
the	13
gate	13
of	13
this	13
castle	13
at	13
this	13
moment,	13
and	13
seeing	13
us	13
as	13
we	13
are	13
here,	13
would	13
suppose	13
or	13
imagine	13
us	13
to	13
be	13
what	13
we	13
are?	13
Who	13
would	13
say	13
that	13
this	13
lady	13
who	13
is	13
beside	13
me	13
was	13
the	13
great	13
queen	13
that	13
we	13
all	13
know	13
her	13
to	13
be,	13
or	13
that	13
I	13
am	13
that	13
Knight	13
of	13
the	13
Rueful	13
Countenance,	13
trumpeted	13
far	13
and	13
wide	13
by	13
the	13
mouth	13
of	13
Fame?	13
Now,	13
there	13
can	13
be	13
no	13
doubt	13
that	13
this	13
art	13
and	13
calling	13
surpasses	13
all	13
those	13
that	13
mankind	13
has	13
invented,	13
and	13
is	13
the	13
more	13
deserving	13
of	13
being	13
held	13
in	13
honour	13
in	13
proportion	13
as	13
it	13
is	13
the	13
more	13
exposed	13
to	13
peril.	13
Away	13
with	13
those	13
who	13
assert	13
that	13
letters	13
have	13
the	13
preeminence	13
over	13
arms;	13
I	13
will	13
tell	13
them,	13
whosoever	13
they	13
may	13
be,	13
that	13
they	13
know	13
not	13
what	13
they	13
say.	13
For	13
the	13
reason	13
which	13
such	13
persons	13
commonly	13
assign,	13
and	13
upon	13
which	13
they	13
chiefly	13
rest,	13
is,	13
that	13
the	13
labours	13
of	13
the	13
mind	13
are	13
greater	13
than	13
those	13
of	13
the	13
body,	13
and	13
that	13
arms	13
give	13
employment	13
to	13
the	13
body	13
alone;	13
as	13
if	13
the	13
calling	13
were	13
a	13
porter’s	13
trade,	13
for	13
which	13
nothing	13
more	13
is	13
required	13
than	13
sturdy	13
strength;	13
or	13
as	13
if,	13
in	13
what	13
we	13
who	13
profess	13
them	13
call	13
arms,	13
there	13
were	13
not	13
included	13
acts	13
of	13
vigour	13
for	13
the	13
execution	13
of	13
which	13
high	13
intelligence	13
is	13
requisite;	13
or	13
as	13
if	13
the	13
soul	13
of	13
the	13
warrior,	13
when	13
he	13
has	13
an	13
army,	13
or	13
the	13
defence	13
of	13
a	13
city	13
under	13
his	13
care,	13
did	13
not	13
exert	13
itself	13
as	13
much	13
by	13
mind	13
as	13
by	13
body.	13
Nay;	13
see	13
whether	13
by	13
bodily	13
strength	13
it	13
be	13
possible	13
to	13
learn	13
or	13
divine	13
the	13
intentions	13
of	13
the	13
enemy,	13
his	13
plans,	13
stratagems,	13
or	13
obstacles,	13
or	13
to	13
ward	13
off	13
impending	13
mischief;	13
for	13
all	13
these	13
are	13
the	13
work	13
of	13
the	13
mind,	13
and	13
in	13
them	13
the	13
body	13
has	13
no	13
share	13
whatever.	13
Since,	13
therefore,	13
arms	13
have	13
need	13
of	13
the	13
mind,	13
as	13
much	13
as	13
letters,	13
let	13
us	13
see	13
now	13
which	13
of	13
the	13
two	13
minds,	13
that	13
of	13
the	13
man	13
of	13
letters	13
or	13
that	13
of	13
the	13
warrior,	13
has	13
most	13
to	13
do;	13
and	13
this	13
will	13
be	13
seen	13
by	13
the	13
end	13
and	13
goal	13
that	13
each	13
seeks	13
to	13
attain;	13
for	13
that	13
purpose	13
is	13
the	13
more	13
estimable	13
which	13
has	13
for	13
its	13
aim	13
the	13
nobler	13
object.	13
The	13
end	13
and	13
goal	13
of	13
letters—I	13
am	13
not	13
speaking	13
now	13
of	13
divine	13
letters,	13
the	13
aim	13
of	13
which	13
is	13
to	13
raise	13
and	13
direct	13
the	13
soul	13
to	13
Heaven;	13
for	13
with	13
an	13
end	13
so	13
infinite	13
no	13
other	13
can	13
be	13
compared—I	13
speak	13
of	13
human	13
letters,	13
the	13
end	13
of	13
which	13
is	13
to	13
establish	13
distributive	13
justice,	13
give	13
to	13
every	13
man	13
that	13
which	13
is	13
his,	13
and	13
see	13
and	13
take	13
care	13
that	13
good	13
laws	13
are	13
observed:	13
an	13
end	13
undoubtedly	13
noble,	13
lofty,	13
and	13
deserving	13
of	13
high	13
praise,	13
but	13
not	13
such	13
as	13
should	13
be	13
given	13
to	13
that	13
sought	13
by	13
arms,	13
which	13
have	13
for	13
their	13
end	13
and	13
object	13
peace,	13
the	13
greatest	13
boon	13
that	13
men	13
can	13
desire	13
in	13
this	13
life.	13
The	13
first	13
good	13
news	13
the	13
world	13
and	13
mankind	13
received	13
was	13
that	13
which	13
the	13
angels	13
announced	13
on	13
the	13
night	13
that	13
was	13
our	13
day,	13
when	13
they	13
sang	13
in	13
the	13
air,	13
‘Glory	13
to	13
God	13
in	13
the	13
highest,	13
and	13
peace	13
on	13
earth	13
to	13
men	13
of	13
good-will;’	13
and	13
the	13
salutation	13
which	13
the	13
great	13
Master	13
of	13
heaven	13
and	13
earth	13
taught	13
his	13
disciples	13
and	13
chosen	13
followers	13
when	13
they	13
entered	13
any	13
house,	13
was	13
to	13
say,	13
‘Peace	13
be	13
on	13
this	13
house;’	13
and	13
many	13
other	13
times	13
he	13
said	13
to	13
them,	13
‘My	13
peace	13
I	13
give	13
unto	13
you,	13
my	13
peace	13
I	13
leave	13
you,	13
peace	13
be	13
with	13
you;’	13
a	13
jewel	13
and	13
a	13
precious	13
gift	13
given	13
and	13
left	13
by	13
such	13
a	13
hand:	13
a	13
jewel	13
without	13
which	13
there	13
can	13
be	13
no	13
happiness	13
either	13
on	13
earth	13
or	13
in	13
heaven.	13
This	13
peace	13
is	13
the	13
true	13
end	13
of	13
war;	13
and	13
war	13
is	13
only	13
another	13
name	13
for	13
arms.	13
This,	13
then,	13
being	13
admitted,	13
that	13
the	13
end	13
of	13
war	13
is	13
peace,	13
and	13
that	13
so	13
far	13
it	13
has	13
the	13
advantage	13
of	13
the	13
end	13
of	13
letters,	13
let	13
us	13
turn	13
to	13
the	13
bodily	13
labours	13
of	13
the	13
man	13
of	13
letters,	13
and	13
those	13
of	13
him	13
who	13
follows	13
the	13
profession	13
of	13
arms,	13
and	13
see	13
which	13
are	13
the	13
greater.”	13
Don	13
Quixote	13
delivered	13
his	13
discourse	13
in	13
such	13
a	13
manner	13
and	13
in	13
such	13
correct	13
language,	13
that	13
for	13
the	13
time	13
being	13
he	13
made	13
it	13
impossible	13
for	13
any	13
of	13
his	13
hearers	13
to	13
consider	13
him	13
a	13
madman;	13
on	13
the	13
contrary,	13
as	13
they	13
were	13
mostly	13
gentlemen,	13
to	13
whom	13
arms	13
are	13
an	13
appurtenance	13
by	13
birth,	13
they	13
listened	13
to	13
him	13
with	13
great	13
pleasure	13
as	13
he	13
continued:	13
“Here,	13
then,	13
I	13
say	13
is	13
what	13
the	13
student	13
has	13
to	13
undergo;	13
first	13
of	13
all	13
poverty:	13
not	13
that	13
all	13
are	13
poor,	13
but	13
to	13
put	13
the	13
case	13
as	13
strongly	13
as	13
possible:	13
and	13
when	13
I	13
have	13
said	13
that	13
he	13
endures	13
poverty,	13
I	13
think	13
nothing	13
more	13
need	13
be	13
said	13
about	13
his	13
hard	13
fortune,	13
for	13
he	13
who	13
is	13
poor	13
has	13
no	13
share	13
of	13
the	13
good	13
things	13
of	13
life.	13
This	13
poverty	13
he	13
suffers	13
from	13
in	13
various	13
ways,	13
hunger,	13
or	13
cold,	13
or	13
nakedness,	13
or	13
all	13
together;	13
but	13
for	13
all	13
that	13
it	13
is	13
not	13
so	13
extreme	13
but	13
that	13
he	13
gets	13
something	13
to	13
eat,	13
though	13
it	13
may	13
be	13
at	13
somewhat	13
unseasonable	13
hours	13
and	13
from	13
the	13
leavings	13
of	13
the	13
rich;	13
for	13
the	13
greatest	13
misery	13
of	13
the	13
student	13
is	13
what	13
they	13
themselves	13
call	13
‘going	13
out	13
for	13
soup,’	13
and	13
there	13
is	13
always	13
some	13
neighbour’s	13
brazier	13
or	13
hearth	13
for	13
them,	13
which,	13
if	13
it	13
does	13
not	13
warm,	13
at	13
least	13
tempers	13
the	13
cold	13
to	13
them,	13
and	13
lastly,	13
they	13
sleep	13
comfortably	13
at	13
night	13
under	13
a	13
roof.	13
I	13
will	13
not	13
go	13
into	13
other	13
particulars,	13
as	13
for	13
example	13
want	13
of	13
shirts,	13
and	13
no	13
superabundance	13
of	13
shoes,	13
thin	13
and	13
threadbare	13
garments,	13
and	13
gorging	13
themselves	13
to	13
surfeit	13
in	13
their	13
voracity	13
when	13
good	13
luck	13
has	13
treated	13
them	13
to	13
a	13
banquet	13
of	13
some	13
sort.	13
By	13
this	13
road	13
that	13
I	13
have	13
described,	13
rough	13
and	13
hard,	13
stumbling	13
here,	13
falling	13
there,	13
getting	13
up	13
again	13
to	13
fall	13
again,	13
they	13
reach	13
the	13
rank	13
they	13
desire,	13
and	13
that	13
once	13
attained,	13
we	13
have	13
seen	13
many	13
who	13
have	13
passed	13
these	13
Syrtes	13
and	13
Scyllas	13
and	13
Charybdises,	13
as	13
if	13
borne	13
flying	13
on	13
the	13
wings	13
of	13
favouring	13
fortune;	13
we	13
have	13
seen	13
them,	13
I	13
say,	13
ruling	13
and	13
governing	13
the	13
world	13
from	13
a	13
chair,	13
their	13
hunger	13
turned	13
into	13
satiety,	13
their	13
cold	13
into	13
comfort,	13
their	13
nakedness	13
into	13
fine	13
raiment,	13
their	13
sleep	13
on	13
a	13
mat	13
into	13
repose	13
in	13
holland	13
and	13
damask,	13
the	13
justly	13
earned	13
reward	13
of	13
their	13
virtue;	13
but,	13
contrasted	13
and	13
compared	13
with	13
what	13
the	13
warrior	13
undergoes,	13
all	13
they	13
have	13
undergone	13
falls	13
far	13
short	13
of	13
it,	13
as	13
I	13
am	13
now	13
about	13
to	13
show.”	13

Continuing	13
his	13
discourse	13
Don	13
Quixote	13
said:	13
“As	13
we	13
began	13
in	13
the	13
student’s	13
case	13
with	13
poverty	13
and	13
its	13
accompaniments,	13
let	13
us	13
see	13
now	13
if	13
the	13
soldier	13
is	13
richer,	13
and	13
we	13
shall	13
find	13
that	13
in	13
poverty	13
itself	13
there	13
is	13
no	13
one	13
poorer;	13
for	13
he	13
is	13
dependent	13
on	13
his	13
miserable	13
pay,	13
which	13
comes	13
late	13
or	13
never,	13
or	13
else	13
on	13
what	13
he	13
can	13
plunder,	13
seriously	13
imperilling	13
his	13
life	13
and	13
conscience;	13
and	13
sometimes	13
his	13
nakedness	13
will	13
be	13
so	13
great	13
that	13
a	13
slashed	13
doublet	13
serves	13
him	13
for	13
uniform	13
and	13
shirt,	13
and	13
in	13
the	13
depth	13
of	13
winter	13
he	13
has	13
to	13
defend	13
himself	13
against	13
the	13
inclemency	13
of	13
the	13
weather	13
in	13
the	13
open	13
field	13
with	13
nothing	13
better	13
than	13
the	13
breath	13
of	13
his	13
mouth,	13
which	13
I	13
need	13
not	13
say,	13
coming	13
from	13
an	13
empty	13
place,	13
must	13
come	13
out	13
cold,	13
contrary	13
to	13
the	13
laws	13
of	13
nature.	13
To	13
be	13
sure	13
he	13
looks	13
forward	13
to	13
the	13
approach	13
of	13
night	13
to	13
make	13
up	13
for	13
all	13
these	13
discomforts	13
on	13
the	13
bed	13
that	13
awaits	13
him,	13
which,	13
unless	13
by	13
some	13
fault	13
of	13
his,	13
never	13
sins	13
by	13
being	13
over	13
narrow,	13
for	13
he	13
can	13
easily	13
measure	13
out	13
on	13
the	13
ground	13
as	13
he	13
likes,	13
and	13
roll	13
himself	13
about	13
in	13
it	13
to	13
his	13
heart’s	13
content	13
without	13
any	13
fear	13
of	13
the	13
sheets	13
slipping	13
away	13
from	13
him.	13
Then,	13
after	13
all	13
this,	13
suppose	13
the	13
day	13
and	13
hour	13
for	13
taking	13
his	13
degree	13
in	13
his	13
calling	13
to	13
have	13
come;	13
suppose	13
the	13
day	13
of	13
battle	13
to	13
have	13
arrived,	13
when	13
they	13
invest	13
him	13
with	13
the	13
doctor’s	13
cap	13
made	13
of	13
lint,	13
to	13
mend	13
some	13
bullet-hole,	13
perhaps,	13
that	13
has	13
gone	13
through	13
his	13
temples,	13
or	13
left	13
him	13
with	13
a	13
crippled	13
arm	13
or	13
leg.	13
Or	13
if	13
this	13
does	13
not	13
happen,	13
and	13
merciful	13
Heaven	13
watches	13
over	13
him	13
and	13
keeps	13
him	13
safe	13
and	13
sound,	13
it	13
may	13
be	13
he	13
will	13
be	13
in	13
the	13
same	13
poverty	13
he	13
was	13
in	13
before,	13
and	13
he	13
must	13
go	13
through	13
more	13
engagements	13
and	13
more	13
battles,	13
and	13
come	13
victorious	13
out	13
of	13
all	13
before	13
he	13
betters	13
himself;	13
but	13
miracles	13
of	13
that	13
sort	13
are	13
seldom	13
seen.	13
For	13
tell	13
me,	13
sirs,	13
if	13
you	13
have	13
ever	13
reflected	13
upon	13
it,	13
by	13
how	13
much	13
do	13
those	13
who	13
have	13
gained	13
by	13
war	13
fall	13
short	13
of	13
the	13
number	13
of	13
those	13
who	13
have	13
perished	13
in	13
it?	13
No	13
doubt	13
you	13
will	13
reply	13
that	13
there	13
can	13
be	13
no	13
comparison,	13
that	13
the	13
dead	13
cannot	13
be	13
numbered,	13
while	13
the	13
living	13
who	13
have	13
been	13
rewarded	13
may	13
be	13
summed	13
up	13
with	13
three	13
figures.	13
All	13
which	13
is	13
the	13
reverse	13
in	13
the	13
case	13
of	13
men	13
of	13
letters;	13
for	13
by	13
skirts,	13
to	13
say	13
nothing	13
of	13
sleeves,	13
they	13
all	13
find	13
means	13
of	13
support;	13
so	13
that	13
though	13
the	13
soldier	13
has	13
more	13
to	13
endure,	13
his	13
reward	13
is	13
much	13
less.	13
But	13
against	13
all	13
this	13
it	13
may	13
be	13
urged	13
that	13
it	13
is	13
easier	13
to	13
reward	13
two	13
thousand	13
soldiers,	13
for	13
the	13
former	13
may	13
be	13
remunerated	13
by	13
giving	13
them	13
places,	13
which	13
must	13
perforce	13
be	13
conferred	13
upon	13
men	13
of	13
their	13
calling,	13
while	13
the	13
latter	13
can	13
only	13
be	13
recompensed	13
out	13
of	13
the	13
very	13
property	13
of	13
the	13
master	13
they	13
serve;	13
but	13
this	13
impossibility	13
only	13
strengthens	13
my	13
argument.	13
“Putting	13
this,	13
however,	13
aside,	13
for	13
it	13
is	13
a	13
puzzling	13
question	13
for	13
which	13
it	13
is	13
difficult	13
to	13
find	13
a	13
solution,	13
let	13
us	13
return	13
to	13
the	13
superiority	13
of	13
arms	13
over	13
letters,	13
a	13
matter	13
still	13
undecided,	13
so	13
many	13
are	13
the	13
arguments	13
put	13
forward	13
on	13
each	13
side;	13
for	13
besides	13
those	13
I	13
have	13
mentioned,	13
letters	13
say	13
that	13
without	13
them	13
arms	13
cannot	13
maintain	13
themselves,	13
for	13
war,	13
too,	13
has	13
its	13
laws	13
and	13
is	13
governed	13
by	13
them,	13
and	13
laws	13
belong	13
to	13
the	13
domain	13
of	13
letters	13
and	13
men	13
of	13
letters.	13
To	13
this	13
arms	13
make	13
answer	13
that	13
without	13
them	13
laws	13
cannot	13
be	13
maintained,	13
for	13
by	13
arms	13
states	13
are	13
defended,	13
kingdoms	13
preserved,	13
cities	13
protected,	13
roads	13
made	13
safe,	13
seas	13
cleared	13
of	13
pirates;	13
and,	13
in	13
short,	13
if	13
it	13
were	13
not	13
for	13
them,	13
states,	13
kingdoms,	13
monarchies,	13
cities,	13
ways	13
by	13
sea	13
and	13
land	13
would	13
be	13
exposed	13
to	13
the	13
violence	13
and	13
confusion	13
which	13
war	13
brings	13
with	13
it,	13
so	13
long	13
as	13
it	13
lasts	13
and	13
is	13
free	13
to	13
make	13
use	13
of	13
its	13
privileges	13
and	13
powers.	13
And	13
then	13
it	13
is	13
plain	13
that	13
whatever	13
costs	13
most	13
is	13
valued	13
and	13
deserves	13
to	13
be	13
valued	13
most.	13
To	13
attain	13
to	13
eminence	13
in	13
letters	13
costs	13
a	13
man	13
time,	13
watching,	13
hunger,	13
nakedness,	13
headaches,	13
indigestions,	13
and	13
other	13
things	13
of	13
the	13
sort,	13
some	13
of	13
which	13
I	13
have	13
already	13
referred	13
to.	13
But	13
for	13
a	13
man	13
to	13
come	13
in	13
the	13
ordinary	13
course	13
of	13
things	13
to	13
be	13
a	13
good	13
soldier	13
costs	13
him	13
all	13
the	13
student	13
suffers,	13
and	13
in	13
an	13
incomparably	13
higher	13
degree,	13
for	13
at	13
every	13
step	13
he	13
runs	13
the	13
risk	13
of	13
losing	13
his	13
life.	13
For	13
what	13
dread	13
of	13
want	13
or	13
poverty	13
that	13
can	13
reach	13
or	13
harass	13
the	13
student	13
can	13
compare	13
with	13
what	13
the	13
soldier	13
feels,	13
who	13
finds	13
himself	13
beleaguered	13
in	13
some	13
stronghold	13
mounting	13
guard	13
in	13
some	13
ravelin	13
or	13
cavalier,	13
knows	13
that	13
the	13
enemy	13
is	13
pushing	13
a	13
mine	13
towards	13
the	13
post	13
where	13
he	13
is	13
stationed,	13
and	13
cannot	13
under	13
any	13
circumstances	13
retire	13
or	13
fly	13
from	13
the	13
imminent	13
danger	13
that	13
threatens	13
him?	13
All	13
he	13
can	13
do	13
is	13
to	13
inform	13
his	13
captain	13
of	13
what	13
is	13
going	13
on	13
so	13
that	13
he	13
may	13
try	13
to	13
remedy	13
it	13
by	13
a	13
counter-mine,	13
and	13
then	13
stand	13
his	13
ground	13
in	13
fear	13
and	13
expectation	13
of	13
the	13
moment	13
when	13
he	13
will	13
fly	13
up	13
to	13
the	13
clouds	13
without	13
wings	13
and	13
descend	13
into	13
the	13
deep	13
against	13
his	13
will.	13
And	13
if	13
this	13
seems	13
a	13
trifling	13
risk,	13
let	13
us	13
see	13
whether	13
it	13
is	13
equalled	13
or	13
surpassed	13
by	13
the	13
encounter	13
of	13
two	13
galleys	13
stem	13
to	13
stem,	13
in	13
the	13
midst	13
of	13
the	13
open	13
sea,	13
locked	13
and	13
entangled	13
one	13
with	13
the	13
other,	13
when	13
the	13
soldier	13
has	13
no	13
more	13
standing	13
room	13
than	13
two	13
feet	13
of	13
the	13
plank	13
of	13
the	13
spur;	13
and	13
yet,	13
though	13
he	13
sees	13
before	13
him	13
threatening	13
him	13
as	13
many	13
ministers	13
of	13
death	13
as	13
there	13
are	13
cannon	13
of	13
the	13
foe	13
pointed	13
at	13
him,	13
not	13
a	13
lance	13
length	13
from	13
his	13
body,	13
and	13
sees	13
too	13
that	13
with	13
the	13
first	13
heedless	13
step	13
he	13
will	13
go	13
down	13
to	13
visit	13
the	13
profundities	13
of	13
Neptune’s	13
bosom,	13
still	13
with	13
dauntless	13
heart,	13
urged	13
on	13
by	13
honour	13
that	13
nerves	13
him,	13
he	13
makes	13
himself	13
a	13
target	13
for	13
all	13
that	13
musketry,	13
and	13
struggles	13
to	13
cross	13
that	13
narrow	13
path	13
to	13
the	13
enemy’s	13
ship.	13
And	13
what	13
is	13
still	13
more	13
marvellous,	13
no	13
sooner	13
has	13
one	13
gone	13
down	13
into	13
the	13
depths	13
he	13
will	13
never	13
rise	13
from	13
till	13
the	13
end	13
of	13
the	13
world,	13
than	13
another	13
takes	13
his	13
place;	13
and	13
if	13
he	13
too	13
falls	13
into	13
the	13
sea	13
that	13
waits	13
for	13
him	13
like	13
an	13
enemy,	13
another	13
and	13
another	13
will	13
succeed	13
him	13
without	13
a	13
moment’s	13
pause	13
between	13
their	13
deaths:	13
courage	13
and	13
daring	13
the	13
greatest	13
that	13
all	13
the	13
chances	13
of	13
war	13
can	13
show.	13
Happy	13
the	13
blest	13
ages	13
that	13
knew	13
not	13
the	13
dread	13
fury	13
of	13
those	13
devilish	13
engines	13
of	13
artillery,	13
whose	13
inventor	13
I	13
am	13
persuaded	13
is	13
in	13
hell	13
receiving	13
the	13
reward	13
of	13
his	13
diabolical	13
invention,	13
by	13
which	13
he	13
made	13
it	13
easy	13
for	13
a	13
base	13
and	13
cowardly	13
arm	13
to	13
take	13
the	13
life	13
of	13
a	13
gallant	13
gentleman;	13
and	13
that,	13
when	13
he	13
knows	13
not	13
how	13
or	13
whence,	13
in	13
the	13
height	13
of	13
the	13
ardour	13
and	13
enthusiasm	13
that	13
fire	13
and	13
animate	13
brave	13
hearts,	13
there	13
should	13
come	13
some	13
random	13
bullet,	13
discharged	13
perhaps	13
by	13
one	13
who	13
fled	13
in	13
terror	13
at	13
the	13
flash	13
when	13
he	13
fired	13
off	13
his	13
accursed	13
machine,	13
which	13
in	13
an	13
instant	13
puts	13
an	13
end	13
to	13
the	13
projects	13
and	13
cuts	13
off	13
the	13
life	13
of	13
one	13
who	13
deserved	13
to	13
live	13
for	13
ages	13
to	13
come.	13
And	13
thus	13
when	13
I	13
reflect	13
on	13
this,	13
I	13
am	13
almost	13
tempted	13
to	13
say	13
that	13
in	13
my	13
heart	13
I	13
repent	13
of	13
having	13
adopted	13
this	13
profession	13
of	13
knight-errant	13
in	13
so	13
detestable	13
an	13
age	13
as	13
we	13
live	13
in	13
now;	13
for	13
though	13
no	13
peril	13
can	13
make	13
me	13
fear,	13
still	13
it	13
gives	13
me	13
some	13
uneasiness	13
to	13
think	13
that	13
powder	13
and	13
lead	13
may	13
rob	13
me	13
of	13
the	13
opportunity	13
of	13
making	13
myself	13
famous	13
and	13
renowned	13
throughout	13
the	13
known	13
earth	13
by	13
the	13
might	13
of	13
my	13
arm	13
and	13
the	13
edge	13
of	13
my	13
sword.	13
But	13
Heaven’s	13
will	13
be	13
done;	13
if	13
I	13
succeed	13
in	13
my	13
attempt	13
I	13
shall	13
be	13
all	13
the	13
more	13
honoured,	13
as	13
I	13
have	13
faced	13
greater	13
dangers	13
than	13
the	13
knights-errant	13
of	13
yore	13
exposed	13
themselves	13
to.”	13
All	13
this	13
lengthy	13
discourse	13
Don	13
Quixote	13
delivered	13
while	13
the	13
others	13
supped,	13
forgetting	13
to	13
raise	13
a	13
morsel	13
to	13
his	13
lips,	13
though	13
Sancho	13
more	13
than	13
once	13
told	13
him	13
to	13
eat	13
his	13
supper,	13
as	13
he	13
would	13
have	13
time	13
enough	13
afterwards	13
to	13
say	13
all	13
he	13
wanted.	13
It	13
excited	13
fresh	13
pity	13
in	13
those	13
who	13
had	13
heard	13
him	13
to	13
see	13
a	13
man	13
of	13
apparently	13
sound	13
sense,	13
and	13
with	13
rational	13
views	13
on	13
every	13
subject	13
he	13
discussed,	13
so	13
hopelessly	13
wanting	13
in	13
all,	13
when	13
his	13
wretched	13
unlucky	13
chivalry	13
was	13
in	13
question.	13
The	13
curate	13
told	13
him	13
he	13
was	13
quite	13
right	13
in	13
all	13
he	13
had	13
said	13
in	13
favour	13
of	13
arms,	13
and	13
that	13
he	13
himself,	13
though	13
a	13
man	13
of	13
letters	13
and	13
a	13
graduate,	13
was	13
of	13
the	13
same	13
opinion.	13
They	13
finished	13
their	13
supper,	13
the	13
cloth	13
was	13
removed,	13
and	13
while	13
the	13
hostess,	13
her	13
daughter,	13
and	13
Maritornes	13
were	13
getting	13
Don	13
Quixote	13
of	13
La	13
Mancha’s	13
garret	13
ready,	13
in	13
which	13
it	13
was	13
arranged	13
that	13
the	13
women	13
were	13
to	13
be	13
quartered	13
by	13
themselves	13
for	13
the	13
night,	13
Don	13
Fernando	13
begged	13
the	13
captive	13
to	13
tell	13
them	13
the	13
story	13
of	13
his	13
life,	13
for	13
it	13
could	13
not	13
fail	13
to	13
be	13
strange	13
and	13
interesting,	13
to	13
judge	13
by	13
the	13
hints	13
he	13
had	13
let	13
fall	13
on	13
his	13
arrival	13
in	13
company	13
with	13
Zoraida.	13
To	13
this	13
the	13
captive	13
replied	13
that	13
he	13
would	13
very	13
willingly	13
yield	13
to	13
his	13
request,	13
only	13
he	13
feared	13
his	13
tale	13
would	13
not	13
give	13
them	13
as	13
much	13
pleasure	13
as	13
he	13
wished;	13
nevertheless,	13
not	13
to	13
be	13
wanting	13
in	13
compliance,	13
he	13
would	13
tell	13
it.	13
The	13
curate	13
and	13
the	13
others	13
thanked	13
him	13
and	13
added	13
their	13
entreaties,	13
and	13
he	13
finding	13
himself	13
so	13
pressed	13
said	13
there	13
was	13
no	13
occasion	13
ask,	13
where	13
a	13
command	13
had	13
such	13
weight,	13
and	13
added,	13
“If	13
your	13
worships	13
will	13
give	13
me	13
your	13
attention	13
you	13
will	13
hear	13
a	13
true	13
story	13
which,	13
perhaps,	13
fictitious	13
ones	13
constructed	13
with	13
ingenious	13
and	13
studied	13
art	13
cannot	13
come	13
up	13
to.”	13
These	13
words	13
made	13
them	13
settle	13
themselves	13
in	13
their	13
places	13
and	13
preserve	13
a	13
deep	13
silence,	13
and	13
he	13
seeing	13
them	13
waiting	13
on	13
his	13
words	13
in	13
mute	13
expectation,	13
began	13
thus	13
in	13
a	13
pleasant	13
quiet	13
voice.	13

WHEREIN	13
THE	13
CAPTIVE	13
RELATES	13
HIS	13
LIFE	13
AND	13
ADVENTURES	13
c39a.jpg	13
(137K)	13
Full	13
Size	13
My	13
family	13
had	13
its	13
origin	13
in	13
a	13
village	13
in	13
the	13
mountains	13
of	13
Leon,	13
and	13
nature	13
had	13
been	13
kinder	13
and	13
more	13
generous	13
to	13
it	13
than	13
fortune;	13
though	13
in	13
the	13
general	13
poverty	13
of	13
those	13
communities	13
my	13
father	13
passed	13
for	13
being	13
even	13
a	13
rich	13
man;	13
and	13
he	13
would	13
have	13
been	13
so	13
in	13
reality	13
had	13
he	13
been	13
as	13
clever	13
in	13
preserving	13
his	13
property	13
as	13
he	13
was	13
in	13
spending	13
it.	13
This	13
tendency	13
of	13
his	13
to	13
be	13
liberal	13
and	13
profuse	13
he	13
had	13
acquired	13
from	13
having	13
been	13
a	13
soldier	13
in	13
his	13
youth,	13
for	13
the	13
soldier’s	13
life	13
is	13
a	13
school	13
in	13
which	13
the	13
niggard	13
becomes	13
free-handed	13
and	13
the	13
free-handed	13
prodigal;	13
and	13
if	13
any	13
soldiers	13
are	13
to	13
be	13
found	13
who	13
are	13
misers,	13
they	13
are	13
monsters	13
of	13
rare	13
occurrence.	13
My	13
father	13
went	13
beyond	13
liberality	13
and	13
bordered	13
on	13
prodigality,	13
a	13
disposition	13
by	13
no	13
means	13
advantageous	13
to	13
a	13
married	13
man	13
who	13
has	13
children	13
to	13
succeed	13
to	13
his	13
name	13
and	13
position.	13
My	13
father	13
had	13
three,	13
all	13
sons,	13
and	13
all	13
of	13
sufficient	13
age	13
to	13
make	13
choice	13
of	13
a	13
profession.	13
Finding,	13
then,	13
that	13
he	13
was	13
unable	13
to	13
resist	13
his	13
propensity,	13
he	13
resolved	13
to	13
divest	13
himself	13
of	13
the	13
instrument	13
and	13
cause	13
of	13
his	13
prodigality	13
and	13
lavishness,	13
to	13
divest	13
himself	13
of	13
wealth,	13
without	13
which	13
Alexander	13
himself	13
would	13
have	13
seemed	13
parsimonious;	13
and	13
so	13
calling	13
us	13
all	13
three	13
aside	13
one	13
day	13
into	13
a	13
room,	13
he	13
addressed	13
us	13
in	13
words	13
somewhat	13
to	13
the	13
following	13
effect:	13
“My	13
sons,	13
to	13
assure	13
you	13
that	13
I	13
love	13
you,	13
no	13
more	13
need	13
be	13
known	13
or	13
said	13
than	13
that	13
you	13
are	13
my	13
sons;	13
and	13
to	13
encourage	13
a	13
suspicion	13
that	13
I	13
do	13
not	13
love	13
you,	13
no	13
more	13
is	13
needed	13
than	13
the	13
knowledge	13
that	13
I	13
have	13
no	13
self-control	13
as	13
far	13
as	13
preservation	13
of	13
your	13
patrimony	13
is	13
concerned;	13
therefore,	13
that	13
you	13
may	13
for	13
the	13
future	13
feel	13
sure	13
that	13
I	13
love	13
you	13
like	13
a	13
father,	13
and	13
have	13
no	13
wish	13
to	13
ruin	13
you	13
like	13
a	13
stepfather,	13
I	13
propose	13
to	13
do	13
with	13
you	13
what	13
I	13
have	13
for	13
some	13
time	13
back	13
meditated,	13
and	13
after	13
mature	13
deliberation	13
decided	13
upon.	13
You	13
are	13
now	13
of	13
an	13
age	13
to	13
choose	13
your	13
line	13
of	13
life	13
or	13
at	13
least	13
make	13
choice	13
of	13
a	13
calling	13
that	13
will	13
bring	13
you	13
honour	13
and	13
profit	13
when	13
you	13
are	13
older;	13
and	13
what	13
I	13
have	13
resolved	13
to	13
do	13
is	13
to	13
divide	13
my	13
property	13
into	13
four	13
parts;	13
three	13
I	13
will	13
give	13
to	13
you,	13
to	13
each	13
his	13
portion	13
without	13
making	13
any	13
difference,	13
and	13
the	13
other	13
I	13
will	13
retain	13
to	13
live	13
upon	13
and	13
support	13
myself	13
for	13
whatever	13
remainder	13
of	13
life	13
Heaven	13
may	13
be	13
pleased	13
to	13
grant	13
me.	13
But	13
I	13
wish	13
each	13
of	13
you	13
on	13
taking	13
possession	13
of	13
the	13
share	13
that	13
falls	13
to	13
him	13
to	13
follow	13
one	13
of	13
the	13
paths	13
I	13
shall	13
indicate.	13
In	13
this	13
Spain	13
of	13
ours	13
there	13
is	13
a	13
proverb,	13
to	13
my	13
mind	13
very	13
true—as	13
they	13
all	13
are,	13
being	13
short	13
aphorisms	13
drawn	13
from	13
long	13
practical	13
experience—and	13
the	13
one	13
I	13
refer	13
to	13
says,	13
‘The	13
church,	13
or	13
the	13
sea,	13
or	13
the	13
king’s	13
house;’	13
as	13
much	13
as	13
to	13
say,	13
in	13
plainer	13
language,	13
whoever	13
wants	13
to	13
flourish	13
and	13
become	13
rich,	13
let	13
him	13
follow	13
the	13
church,	13
or	13
go	13
to	13
sea,	13
adopting	13
commerce	13
as	13
his	13
calling,	13
or	13
go	13
into	13
the	13
king’s	13
service	13
in	13
his	13
household,	13
for	13
they	13
say,	13
‘Better	13
a	13
king’s	13
crumb	13
than	13
a	13
lord’s	13
favour.’	13
I	13
say	13
so	13
because	13
it	13
is	13
my	13
will	13
and	13
pleasure	13
that	13
one	13
of	13
you	13
should	13
follow	13
letters,	13
another	13
trade,	13
and	13
the	13
third	13
serve	13
the	13
king	13
in	13
the	13
wars,	13
for	13
it	13
is	13
a	13
difficult	13
matter	13
to	13
gain	13
admission	13
to	13
his	13
service	13
in	13
his	13
household,	13
and	13
if	13
war	13
does	13
not	13
bring	13
much	13
wealth	13
it	13
confers	13
great	13
distinction	13
and	13
fame.	13
Eight	13
days	13
hence	13
I	13
will	13
give	13
you	13
your	13
full	13
shares	13
in	13
money,	13
without	13
defrauding	13
you	13
of	13
a	13
farthing,	13
as	13
you	13
will	13
see	13
in	13
the	13
end.	13
Now	13
tell	13
me	13
if	13
you	13
are	13
willing	13
to	13
follow	13
out	13
my	13
idea	13
and	13
advice	13
as	13
I	13
have	13
laid	13
it	13
before	13
you.”	13
Having	13
called	13
upon	13
me	13
as	13
the	13
eldest	13
to	13
answer,	13
I,	13
after	13
urging	13
him	13
not	13
to	13
strip	13
himself	13
of	13
his	13
property	13
but	13
to	13
spend	13
it	13
all	13
as	13
he	13
pleased,	13
for	13
we	13
were	13
young	13
men	13
able	13
to	13
gain	13
our	13
living,	13
consented	13
to	13
comply	13
with	13
his	13
wishes,	13
and	13
said	13
that	13
mine	13
were	13
to	13
follow	13
the	13
profession	13
of	13
arms	13
and	13
thereby	13
serve	13
God	13
and	13
my	13
king.	13
My	13
second	13
brother	13
having	13
made	13
the	13
same	13
proposal,	13
decided	13
upon	13
going	13
to	13
the	13
Indies,	13
embarking	13
the	13
portion	13
that	13
fell	13
to	13
him	13
in	13
trade.	13
The	13
youngest,	13
and	13
in	13
my	13
opinion	13
the	13
wisest,	13
said	13
he	13
would	13
rather	13
follow	13
the	13
church,	13
or	13
go	13
to	13
complete	13
his	13
studies	13
at	13
Salamanca.	13
As	13
soon	13
as	13
we	13
had	13
come	13
to	13
an	13
understanding,	13
and	13
made	13
choice	13
of	13
our	13
professions,	13
my	13
father	13
embraced	13
us	13
all,	13
and	13
in	13
the	13
short	13
time	13
he	13
mentioned	13
carried	13
into	13
effect	13
all	13
he	13
had	13
promised;	13
and	13
when	13
he	13
had	13
given	13
to	13
each	13
his	13
share,	13
which	13
as	13
well	13
as	13
I	13
remember	13
was	13
three	13
thousand	13
ducats	13
apiece	13
in	13
cash	13
(for	13
an	13
uncle	13
of	13
ours	13
bought	13
the	13
estate	13
and	13
paid	13
for	13
it	13
down,	13
not	13
to	13
let	13
it	13
go	13
out	13
of	13
the	13
family),	13
we	13
all	13
three	13
on	13
the	13
same	13
day	13
took	13
leave	13
of	13
our	13
good	13
father;	13
and	13
at	13
the	13
same	13
time,	13
as	13
it	13
seemed	13
to	13
me	13
inhuman	13
to	13
leave	13
my	13
father	13
with	13
such	13
scanty	13
means	13
in	13
his	13
old	13
age,	13
I	13
induced	13
him	13
to	13
take	13
two	13
of	13
my	13
three	13
thousand	13
ducats,	13
as	13
the	13
remainder	13
would	13
be	13
enough	13
to	13
provide	13
me	13
with	13
all	13
a	13
soldier	13
needed.	13
My	13
two	13
brothers,	13
moved	13
by	13
my	13
example,	13
gave	13
him	13
each	13
a	13
thousand	13
ducats,	13
so	13
that	13
there	13
was	13
left	13
for	13
my	13
father	13
four	13
thousand	13
ducats	13
in	13
money,	13
besides	13
three	13
thousand,	13
the	13
value	13
of	13
the	13
portion	13
that	13
fell	13
to	13
him	13
which	13
he	13
preferred	13
to	13
retain	13
in	13
land	13
instead	13
of	13
selling	13
it.	13
Finally,	13
as	13
I	13
said,	13
we	13
took	13
leave	13
of	13
him,	13
and	13
of	13
our	13
uncle	13
whom	13
I	13
have	13
mentioned,	13
not	13
without	13
sorrow	13
and	13
tears	13
on	13
both	13
sides,	13
they	13
charging	13
us	13
to	13
let	13
them	13
know	13
whenever	13
an	13
opportunity	13
offered	13
how	13
we	13
fared,	13
whether	13
well	13
or	13
ill.	13
We	13
promised	13
to	13
do	13
so,	13
and	13
when	13
he	13
had	13
embraced	13
us	13
and	13
given	13
us	13
his	13
blessing,	13
one	13
set	13
out	13
for	13
Salamanca,	13
the	13
other	13
for	13
Seville,	13
and	13
I	13
for	13
Alicante,	13
where	13
I	13
had	13
heard	13
there	13
was	13
a	13
Genoese	13
vessel	13
taking	13
in	13
a	13
cargo	13
of	13
wool	13
for	13
Genoa.	13
It	13
is	13
now	13
some	13
twenty-two	13
years	13
since	13
I	13
left	13
my	13
father’s	13
house,	13
and	13
all	13
that	13
time,	13
though	13
I	13
have	13
written	13
several	13
letters,	13
I	13
have	13
had	13
no	13
news	13
whatever	13
of	13
him	13
or	13
of	13
my	13
brothers;	13
my	13
own	13
adventures	13
during	13
that	13
period	13
I	13
will	13
now	13
relate	13
briefly.	13
I	13
embarked	13
at	13
Alicante,	13
reached	13
Genoa	13
after	13
a	13
prosperous	13
voyage,	13
and	13
proceeded	13
thence	13
to	13
Milan,	13
where	13
I	13
provided	13
myself	13
with	13
arms	13
and	13
a	13
few	13
soldier’s	13
accoutrements;	13
thence	13
it	13
was	13
my	13
intention	13
to	13
go	13
and	13
take	13
service	13
in	13
Piedmont,	13
but	13
as	13
I	13
was	13
already	13
on	13
the	13
road	13
to	13
Alessandria	13
della	13
Paglia,	13
I	13
learned	13
that	13
the	13
great	13
Duke	13
of	13
Alva	13
was	13
on	13
his	13
way	13
to	13
Flanders.	13
I	13
changed	13
my	13
plans,	13
joined	13
him,	13
served	13
under	13
him	13
in	13
the	13
campaigns	13
he	13
made,	13
was	13
present	13
at	13
the	13
deaths	13
of	13
the	13
Counts	13
Egmont	13
and	13
Horn,	13
and	13
was	13
promoted	13
to	13
be	13
ensign	13
under	13
a	13
famous	13
captain	13
of	13
Guadalajara,	13
Diego	13
de	13
Urbina	13
by	13
name.	13
Some	13
time	13
after	13
my	13
arrival	13
in	13
Flanders	13
news	13
came	13
of	13
the	13
league	13
that	13
his	13
Holiness	13
Pope	13
Pius	13
V.	13
of	13
happy	13
memory,	13
had	13
made	13
with	13
Venice	13
and	13
Spain	13
against	13
the	13
common	13
enemy,	13
the	13
Turk,	13
who	13
had	13
just	13
then	13
with	13
his	13
fleet	13
taken	13
the	13
famous	13
island	13
of	13
Cyprus,	13
which	13
belonged	13
to	13
the	13
Venetians,	13
a	13
loss	13
deplorable	13
and	13
disastrous.	13
It	13
was	13
known	13
as	13
a	13
fact	13
that	13
the	13
Most	13
Serene	13
Don	13
John	13
of	13
Austria,	13
natural	13
brother	13
of	13
our	13
good	13
king	13
Don	13
Philip,	13
was	13
coming	13
as	13
commander-in-chief	13
of	13
the	13
allied	13
forces,	13
and	13
rumours	13
were	13
abroad	13
of	13
the	13
vast	13
warlike	13
preparations	13
which	13
were	13
being	13
made,	13
all	13
which	13
stirred	13
my	13
heart	13
and	13
filled	13
me	13
with	13
a	13
longing	13
to	13
take	13
part	13
in	13
the	13
campaign	13
which	13
was	13
expected;	13
and	13
though	13
I	13
had	13
reason	13
to	13
believe,	13
and	13
almost	13
certain	13
promises,	13
that	13
on	13
the	13
first	13
opportunity	13
that	13
presented	13
itself	13
I	13
should	13
be	13
promoted	13
to	13
be	13
captain,	13
I	13
preferred	13
to	13
leave	13
all	13
and	13
betake	13
myself,	13
as	13
I	13
did,	13
to	13
Italy;	13
and	13
it	13
was	13
my	13
good	13
fortune	13
that	13
Don	13
John	13
had	13
just	13
arrived	13
at	13
Genoa,	13
and	13
was	13
going	13
on	13
to	13
Naples	13
to	13
join	13
the	13
Venetian	13
fleet,	13
as	13
he	13
afterwards	13
did	13
at	13
Messina.	13
I	13
may	13
say,	13
in	13
short,	13
that	13
I	13
took	13
part	13
in	13
that	13
glorious	13
expedition,	13
promoted	13
by	13
this	13
time	13
to	13
be	13
a	13
captain	13
of	13
infantry,	13
to	13
which	13
honourable	13
charge	13
my	13
good	13
luck	13
rather	13
than	13
my	13
merits	13
raised	13
me;	13
and	13
that	13
day—so	13
fortunate	13
for	13
Christendom,	13
because	13
then	13
all	13
the	13
nations	13
of	13
the	13
earth	13
were	13
disabused	13
of	13
the	13
error	13
under	13
which	13
they	13
lay	13
in	13
imagining	13
the	13
Turks	13
to	13
be	13
invincible	13
on	13
sea—on	13
that	13
day,	13
I	13
say,	13
on	13
which	13
the	13
Ottoman	13
pride	13
and	13
arrogance	13
were	13
broken,	13
among	13
all	13
that	13
were	13
there	13
made	13
happy	13
(for	13
the	13
Christians	13
who	13
died	13
that	13
day	13
were	13
happier	13
than	13
those	13
who	13
remained	13
alive	13
and	13
victorious)	13
I	13
alone	13
was	13
miserable;	13
for,	13
instead	13
of	13
some	13
naval	13
crown	13
that	13
I	13
might	13
have	13
expected	13
had	13
it	13
been	13
in	13
Roman	13
times,	13
on	13
the	13
night	13
that	13
followed	13
that	13
famous	13
day	13
I	13
found	13
myself	13
with	13
fetters	13
on	13
my	13
feet	13
and	13
manacles	13
on	13
my	13
hands.	13
It	13
happened	13
in	13
this	13
way:	13
El	13
Uchali,	13
the	13
king	13
of	13
Algiers,	13
a	13
daring	13
and	13
successful	13
corsair,	13
having	13
attacked	13
and	13
taken	13
the	13
leading	13
Maltese	13
galley	13
(only	13
three	13
knights	13
being	13
left	13
alive	13
in	13
it,	13
and	13
they	13
badly	13
wounded),	13
the	13
chief	13
galley	13
of	13
John	13
Andrea,	13
on	13
board	13
of	13
which	13
I	13
and	13
my	13
company	13
were	13
placed,	13
came	13
to	13
its	13
relief,	13
and	13
doing	13
as	13
was	13
bound	13
to	13
do	13
in	13
such	13
a	13
case,	13
I	13
leaped	13
on	13
board	13
the	13
enemy’s	13
galley,	13
which,	13
sheering	13
off	13
from	13
that	13
which	13
had	13
attacked	13
it,	13
prevented	13
my	13
men	13
from	13
following	13
me,	13
and	13
so	13
I	13
found	13
myself	13
alone	13
in	13
the	13
midst	13
of	13
my	13
enemies,	13
who	13
were	13
in	13
such	13
numbers	13
that	13
I	13
was	13
unable	13
to	13
resist;	13
in	13
short	13
I	13
was	13
taken,	13
covered	13
with	13
wounds;	13
El	13
Uchali,	13
as	13
you	13
know,	13
sirs,	13
made	13
his	13
escape	13
with	13
his	13
entire	13
squadron,	13
and	13
I	13
was	13
left	13
a	13
prisoner	13
in	13
his	13
power,	13
the	13
only	13
sad	13
being	13
among	13
so	13
many	13
filled	13
with	13
joy,	13
and	13
the	13
only	13
captive	13
among	13
so	13
many	13
free;	13
for	13
there	13
were	13
fifteen	13
thousand	13
Christians,	13
all	13
at	13
the	13
oar	13
in	13
the	13
Turkish	13
fleet,	13
that	13
regained	13
their	13
longed-for	13
liberty	13
that	13
day.	13
They	13
carried	13
me	13
to	13
Constantinople,	13
where	13
the	13
Grand	13
Turk,	13
Selim,	13
made	13
my	13
master	13
general	13
at	13
sea	13
for	13
having	13
done	13
his	13
duty	13
in	13
the	13
battle	13
and	13
carried	13
off	13
as	13
evidence	13
of	13
his	13
bravery	13
the	13
standard	13
of	13
the	13
Order	13
of	13
Malta.	13
The	13
following	13
year,	13
which	13
was	13
the	13
year	13
seventy-two,	13
I	13
found	13
myself	13
at	13
Navarino	13
rowing	13
in	13
the	13
leading	13
galley	13
with	13
the	13
three	13
lanterns.	13
There	13
I	13
saw	13
and	13
observed	13
how	13
the	13
opportunity	13
of	13
capturing	13
the	13
whole	13
Turkish	13
fleet	13
in	13
harbour	13
was	13
lost;	13
for	13
all	13
the	13
marines	13
and	13
janizzaries	13
that	13
belonged	13
to	13
it	13
made	13
sure	13
that	13
they	13
were	13
about	13
to	13
be	13
attacked	13
inside	13
the	13
very	13
harbour,	13
and	13
had	13
their	13
kits	13
and	13
pasamaques,	13
or	13
shoes,	13
ready	13
to	13
flee	13
at	13
once	13
on	13
shore	13
without	13
waiting	13
to	13
be	13
assailed,	13
in	13
so	13
great	13
fear	13
did	13
they	13
stand	13
of	13
our	13
fleet.	13
But	13
Heaven	13
ordered	13
it	13
otherwise,	13
not	13
for	13
any	13
fault	13
or	13
neglect	13
of	13
the	13
general	13
who	13
commanded	13
on	13
our	13
side,	13
but	13
for	13
the	13
sins	13
of	13
Christendom,	13
and	13
because	13
it	13
was	13
God’s	13
will	13
and	13
pleasure	13
that	13
we	13
should	13
always	13
have	13
instruments	13
of	13
punishment	13
to	13
chastise	13
us.	13
As	13
it	13
was,	13
El	13
Uchali	13
took	13
refuge	13
at	13
Modon,	13
which	13
is	13
an	13
island	13
near	13
Navarino,	13
and	13
landing	13
forces	13
fortified	13
the	13
mouth	13
of	13
the	13
harbour	13
and	13
waited	13
quietly	13
until	13
Don	13
John	13
retired.	13
On	13
this	13
expedition	13
was	13
taken	13
the	13
galley	13
called	13
the	13
Prize,	13
whose	13
captain	13
was	13
a	13
son	13
of	13
the	13
famous	13
corsair	13
Barbarossa.	13
It	13
was	13
taken	13
by	13
the	13
chief	13
Neapolitan	13
galley	13
called	13
the	13
She-wolf,	13
commanded	13
by	13
that	13
thunderbolt	13
of	13
war,	13
that	13
father	13
of	13
his	13
men,	13
that	13
successful	13
and	13
unconquered	13
captain	13
Don	13
Álvaro	13
de	13
Bazan,	13
Marquis	13
of	13
Santa	13
Cruz;	13
and	13
I	13
cannot	13
help	13
telling	13
you	13
what	13
took	13
place	13
at	13
the	13
capture	13
of	13
the	13
Prize.	13
The	13
son	13
of	13
Barbarossa	13
was	13
so	13
cruel,	13
and	13
treated	13
his	13
slaves	13
so	13
badly,	13
that,	13
when	13
those	13
who	13
were	13
at	13
the	13
oars	13
saw	13
that	13
the	13
She-wolf	13
galley	13
was	13
bearing	13
down	13
upon	13
them	13
and	13
gaining	13
upon	13
them,	13
they	13
all	13
at	13
once	13
dropped	13
their	13
oars	13
and	13
seized	13
their	13
captain	13
who	13
stood	13
on	13
the	13
stage	13
at	13
the	13
end	13
of	13
the	13
gangway	13
shouting	13
to	13
them	13
to	13
row	13
lustily;	13
and	13
passing	13
him	13
on	13
from	13
bench	13
to	13
bench,	13
from	13
the	13
poop	13
to	13
the	13
prow,	13
they	13
so	13
bit	13
him	13
that	13
before	13
he	13
had	13
got	13
much	13
past	13
the	13
mast	13
his	13
soul	13
had	13
already	13
got	13
to	13
hell;	13
so	13
great,	13
as	13
I	13
said,	13
was	13
the	13
cruelty	13
with	13
which	13
he	13
treated	13
them,	13
and	13
the	13
hatred	13
with	13
which	13
they	13
hated	13
him.	13
We	13
returned	13
to	13
Constantinople,	13
and	13
the	13
following	13
year,	13
seventy-three,	13
it	13
became	13
known	13
that	13
Don	13
John	13
had	13
seized	13
Tunis	13
and	13
taken	13
the	13
kingdom	13
from	13
the	13
Turks,	13
and	13
placed	13
Muley	13
Hamet	13
in	13
possession,	13
putting	13
an	13
end	13
to	13
the	13
hopes	13
which	13
Muley	13
Hamida,	13
the	13
cruelest	13
and	13
bravest	13
Moor	13
in	13
the	13
world,	13
entertained	13
of	13
returning	13
to	13
reign	13
there.	13
The	13
Grand	13
Turk	13
took	13
the	13
loss	13
greatly	13
to	13
heart,	13
and	13
with	13
the	13
cunning	13
which	13
all	13
his	13
race	13
possess,	13
he	13
made	13
peace	13
with	13
the	13
Venetians	13
(who	13
were	13
much	13
more	13
eager	13
for	13
it	13
than	13
he	13
was),	13
and	13
the	13
following	13
year,	13
seventy-four,	13
he	13
attacked	13
the	13
Goletta	13
and	13
the	13
fort	13
which	13
Don	13
John	13
had	13
left	13
half	13
built	13
near	13
Tunis.	13
While	13
all	13
these	13
events	13
were	13
occurring,	13
I	13
was	13
labouring	13
at	13
the	13
oar	13
without	13
any	13
hope	13
of	13
freedom;	13
at	13
least	13
I	13
had	13
no	13
hope	13
of	13
obtaining	13
it	13
by	13
ransom,	13
for	13
I	13
was	13
firmly	13
resolved	13
not	13
to	13
write	13
to	13
my	13
father	13
telling	13
him	13
of	13
my	13
misfortunes.	13
At	13
length	13
the	13
Goletta	13
fell,	13
and	13
the	13
fort	13
fell,	13
before	13
which	13
places	13
there	13
were	13
seventy-five	13
thousand	13
regular	13
Turkish	13
soldiers,	13
and	13
more	13
than	13
four	13
hundred	13
thousand	13
Moors	13
and	13
Arabs	13
from	13
all	13
parts	13
of	13
Africa,	13
and	13
in	13
the	13
train	13
of	13
all	13
this	13
great	13
host	13
such	13
munitions	13
and	13
engines	13
of	13
war,	13
and	13
so	13
many	13
pioneers	13
that	13
with	13
their	13
hands	13
they	13
might	13
have	13
covered	13
the	13
Goletta	13
and	13
the	13
fort	13
with	13
handfuls	13
of	13
earth.	13
The	13
first	13
to	13
fall	13
was	13
the	13
Goletta,	13
until	13
then	13
reckoned	13
impregnable,	13
and	13
it	13
fell,	13
not	13
by	13
any	13
fault	13
of	13
its	13
defenders,	13
who	13
did	13
all	13
that	13
they	13
could	13
and	13
should	13
have	13
done,	13
but	13
because	13
experiment	13
proved	13
how	13
easily	13
entrenchments	13
could	13
be	13
made	13
in	13
the	13
desert	13
sand	13
there;	13
for	13
water	13
used	13
to	13
be	13
found	13
at	13
two	13
palms	13
depth,	13
while	13
the	13
Turks	13
found	13
none	13
at	13
two	13
yards;	13
and	13
so	13
by	13
means	13
of	13
a	13
quantity	13
of	13
sandbags	13
they	13
raised	13
their	13
works	13
so	13
high	13
that	13
they	13
commanded	13
the	13
walls	13
of	13
the	13
fort,	13
sweeping	13
them	13
as	13
if	13
from	13
a	13
cavalier,	13
so	13
that	13
no	13
one	13
was	13
able	13
to	13
make	13
a	13
stand	13
or	13
maintain	13
the	13
defence.	13
It	13
was	13
a	13
common	13
opinion	13
that	13
our	13
men	13
should	13
not	13
have	13
shut	13
themselves	13
up	13
in	13
the	13
Goletta,	13
but	13
should	13
have	13
waited	13
in	13
the	13
open	13
at	13
the	13
landing-place;	13
but	13
those	13
who	13
say	13
so	13
talk	13
at	13
random	13
and	13
with	13
little	13
knowledge	13
of	13
such	13
matters;	13
for	13
if	13
in	13
the	13
Goletta	13
and	13
in	13
the	13
fort	13
there	13
were	13
barely	13
seven	13
thousand	13
soldiers,	13
how	13
could	13
such	13
a	13
small	13
number,	13
however	13
resolute,	13
sally	13
out	13
and	13
hold	13
their	13
own	13
against	13
numbers	13
like	13
those	13
of	13
the	13
enemy?	13
And	13
how	13
is	13
it	13
possible	13
to	13
help	13
losing	13
a	13
stronghold	13
that	13
is	13
not	13
relieved,	13
above	13
all	13
when	13
surrounded	13
by	13
a	13
host	13
of	13
determined	13
enemies	13
in	13
their	13
own	13
country?	13
But	13
many	13
thought,	13
and	13
I	13
thought	13
so	13
too,	13
that	13
it	13
was	13
special	13
favour	13
and	13
mercy	13
which	13
Heaven	13
showed	13
to	13
Spain	13
in	13
permitting	13
the	13
destruction	13
of	13
that	13
source	13
and	13
hiding	13
place	13
of	13
mischief,	13
that	13
devourer,	13
sponge,	13
and	13
moth	13
of	13
countless	13
money,	13
fruitlessly	13
wasted	13
there	13
to	13
no	13
other	13
purpose	13
save	13
preserving	13
the	13
memory	13
of	13
its	13
capture	13
by	13
the	13
invincible	13
Charles	13
V.;	13
as	13
if	13
to	13
make	13
that	13
eternal,	13
as	13
it	13
is	13
and	13
will	13
be,	13
these	13
stones	13
were	13
needed	13
to	13
support	13
it.	13
The	13
fort	13
also	13
fell;	13
but	13
the	13
Turks	13
had	13
to	13
win	13
it	13
inch	13
by	13
inch,	13
for	13
the	13
soldiers	13
who	13
defended	13
it	13
fought	13
so	13
gallantly	13
and	13
stoutly	13
that	13
the	13
number	13
of	13
the	13
enemy	13
killed	13
in	13
twenty-two	13
general	13
assaults	13
exceeded	13
twenty-five	13
thousand.	13
Of	13
three	13
hundred	13
that	13
remained	13
alive	13
not	13
one	13
was	13
taken	13
unwounded,	13
a	13
clear	13
and	13
manifest	13
proof	13
of	13
their	13
gallantry	13
and	13
resolution,	13
and	13
how	13
sturdily	13
they	13
had	13
defended	13
themselves	13
and	13
held	13
their	13
post.	13
A	13
small	13
fort	13
or	13
tower	13
which	13
was	13
in	13
the	13
middle	13
of	13
the	13
lagoon	13
under	13
the	13
command	13
of	13
Don	13
Juan	13
Zanoguera,	13
a	13
Valencian	13
gentleman	13
and	13
a	13
famous	13
soldier,	13
capitulated	13
upon	13
terms.	13
They	13
took	13
prisoner	13
Don	13
Pedro	13
Puertocarrero,	13
commandant	13
of	13
the	13
Goletta,	13
who	13
had	13
done	13
all	13
in	13
his	13
power	13
to	13
defend	13
his	13
fortress,	13
and	13
took	13
the	13
loss	13
of	13
it	13
so	13
much	13
to	13
heart	13
that	13
he	13
died	13
of	13
grief	13
on	13
the	13
way	13
to	13
Constantinople,	13
where	13
they	13
were	13
carrying	13
him	13
a	13
prisoner.	13
They	13
also	13
took	13
the	13
commandant	13
of	13
the	13
fort,	13
Gabrio	13
Cerbellon	13
by	13
name,	13
a	13
Milanese	13
gentleman,	13
a	13
great	13
engineer	13
and	13
a	13
very	13
brave	13
soldier.	13
In	13
these	13
two	13
fortresses	13
perished	13
many	13
persons	13
of	13
note,	13
among	13
whom	13
was	13
Pagano	13
Doria,	13
knight	13
of	13
the	13
Order	13
of	13
St.	13
John,	13
a	13
man	13
of	13
generous	13
disposition,	13
as	13
was	13
shown	13
by	13
his	13
extreme	13
liberality	13
to	13
his	13
brother,	13
the	13
famous	13
John	13
Andrea	13
Doria;	13
and	13
what	13
made	13
his	13
death	13
the	13
more	13
sad	13
was	13
that	13
he	13
was	13
slain	13
by	13
some	13
Arabs	13
to	13
whom,	13
seeing	13
that	13
the	13
fort	13
was	13
now	13
lost,	13
he	13
entrusted	13
himself,	13
and	13
who	13
offered	13
to	13
conduct	13
him	13
in	13
the	13
disguise	13
of	13
a	13
Moor	13
to	13
Tabarca,	13
a	13
small	13
fort	13
or	13
station	13
on	13
the	13
coast	13
held	13
by	13
the	13
Genoese	13
employed	13
in	13
the	13
coral	13
fishery.	13
These	13
Arabs	13
cut	13
off	13
his	13
head	13
and	13
carried	13
it	13
to	13
the	13
commander	13
of	13
the	13
Turkish	13
fleet,	13
who	13
proved	13
on	13
them	13
the	13
truth	13
of	13
our	13
Castilian	13
proverb,	13
that	13
“though	13
the	13
treason	13
may	13
please,	13
the	13
traitor	13
is	13
hated;”	13
for	13
they	13
say	13
he	13
ordered	13
those	13
who	13
brought	13
him	13
the	13
present	13
to	13
be	13
hanged	13
for	13
not	13
having	13
brought	13
him	13
alive.	13

Among	13
the	13
Christians	13
who	13
were	13
taken	13
in	13
the	13
fort	13
was	13
one	13
named	13
Don	13
Pedro	13
de	13
Aguilar,	13
a	13
native	13
of	13
some	13
place,	13
I	13
know	13
not	13
what,	13
in	13
Andalusia,	13
who	13
had	13
been	13
ensign	13
in	13
the	13
fort,	13
a	13
soldier	13
of	13
great	13
repute	13
and	13
rare	13
intelligence,	13
who	13
had	13
in	13
particular	13
a	13
special	13
gift	13
for	13
what	13
they	13
call	13
poetry.	13
I	13
say	13
so	13
because	13
his	13
fate	13
brought	13
him	13
to	13
my	13
galley	13
and	13
to	13
my	13
bench,	13
and	13
made	13
him	13
a	13
slave	13
to	13
the	13
same	13
master;	13
and	13
before	13
we	13
left	13
the	13
port	13
this	13
gentleman	13
composed	13
two	13
sonnets	13
by	13
way	13
of	13
epitaphs,	13
one	13
on	13
the	13
Goletta	13
and	13
the	13
other	13
on	13
the	13
fort;	13
indeed,	13
I	13
may	13
as	13
well	13
repeat	13
them,	13
for	13
I	13
have	13
them	13
by	13
heart,	13
and	13
I	13
think	13
they	13
will	13
be	13
liked	13
rather	13
than	13
disliked.	13
The	13
instant	13
the	13
captive	13
mentioned	13
the	13
name	13
of	13
Don	13
Pedro	13
de	13
Aguilar,	13
Don	13
Fernando	13
looked	13
at	13
his	13
companions	13
and	13
they	13
all	13
three	13
smiled;	13
and	13
when	13
he	13
came	13
to	13
speak	13
of	13
the	13
sonnets	13
one	13
of	13
them	13
said,	13
“Before	13
your	13
worship	13
proceeds	13
any	13
further	13
I	13
entreat	13
you	13
to	13
tell	13
me	13
what	13
became	13
of	13
that	13
Don	13
Pedro	13
de	13
Aguilar	13
you	13
have	13
spoken	13
of.”	13
“All	13
I	13
know	13
is,”	13
replied	13
the	13
captive,	13
“that	13
after	13
having	13
been	13
in	13
Constantinople	13
two	13
years,	13
he	13
escaped	13
in	13
the	13
disguise	13
of	13
an	13
Arnaut,	13
in	13
company	13
with	13
a	13
Greek	13
spy;	13
but	13
whether	13
he	13
regained	13
his	13
liberty	13
or	13
not	13
I	13
cannot	13
tell,	13
though	13
I	13
fancy	13
he	13
did,	13
because	13
a	13
year	13
afterwards	13
I	13
saw	13
the	13
Greek	13
at	13
Constantinople,	13
though	13
I	13
was	13
unable	13
to	13
ask	13
him	13
what	13
the	13
result	13
of	13
the	13
journey	13
was.”	13
“Well	13
then,	13
you	13
are	13
right,”	13
returned	13
the	13
gentleman,	13
“for	13
that	13
Don	13
Pedro	13
is	13
my	13
brother,	13
and	13
he	13
is	13
now	13
in	13
our	13
village	13
in	13
good	13
health,	13
rich,	13
married,	13
and	13
with	13
three	13
children.”	13
“Thanks	13
be	13
to	13
God	13
for	13
all	13
the	13
mercies	13
he	13
has	13
shown	13
him,”	13
said	13
the	13
captive;	13
“for	13
to	13
my	13
mind	13
there	13
is	13
no	13
happiness	13
on	13
earth	13
to	13
compare	13
with	13
recovering	13
lost	13
liberty.”	13
“And	13
what	13
is	13
more,”	13
said	13
the	13
gentleman,	13
“I	13
know	13
the	13
sonnets	13
my	13
brother	13
made.”	13
“Then	13
let	13
your	13
worship	13
repeat	13
them,”	13
said	13
the	13
captive,	13
“for	13
you	13
will	13
recite	13
them	13
better	13
than	13
I	13
can.”	13
“With	13
all	13
my	13
heart,”	13
said	13
the	13
gentleman;	13
“that	13
on	13
the	13
Goletta	13
runs	13
thus.”	13

“Blest	13
souls,	13
that,	13
from	13
this	13
mortal	13
husk	13
set	13
free,	13
In	13
guerdon	13
of	13
brave	13
deeds	13
beatified,	13
Above	13
this	13
lowly	13
orb	13
of	13
ours	13

Made	13
heirs	13
of	13
heaven	13
and	13
immortality,	13
With	13
noble	13
rage	13
and	13
ardour	13
glowing	13
ye	13
Your	13
strength,	13
while	13
strength	13
was	13
yours,	13
in	13
battle	13
plied,	13
And	13
with	13
your	13
own	13
blood	13
and	13
the	13
foeman’s	13
dyed	13
The	13
sandy	13
soil	13
and	13
the	13
encircling	13
sea.	13
It	13
was	13
the	13
ebbing	13
life-blood	13
first	13
that	13
failed	13
The	13
weary	13
arms;	13
the	13
stout	13
hearts	13
never	13
quailed.	13
Though	13
vanquished,	13
yet	13
ye	13
earned	13
the	13
victor’s	13
crown:	13
Though	13
mourned,	13
yet	13
still	13
triumphant	13
was	13
your	13
fall	13
For	13
there	13

In	13

“That	13
is	13
it	13
exactly,	13
according	13
to	13
my	13
recollection,”	13
said	13
the	13
captive.	13
“Well	13
then,	13
that	13
on	13
the	13
fort,”	13
said	13
the	13
gentleman,	13
“if	13
my	13
memory	13

me,	13
goes	13
thus:	13
SONNET	13
“Up	13
from	13
this	13
wasted	13
soil,	13
this	13
shattered	13
shell,	13
Whose	13
walls	13
and	13
towers	13
here	13
in	13
ruin	13
lie,	13
Three	13
thousand	13
soldier	13
souls	13
took	13
wing	13
on	13
high,	13
In	13
the	13
bright	13
mansions	13
of	13
the	13
blest	13
to	13
dwell.	13
The	13
onslaught	13
of	13
the	13
foeman	13
to	13
repel	13
By	13
might	13
of	13
arm	13
all	13
vainly	13
did	13
they	13
try,	13
And	13
when	13
at	13
length	13
’twas	13
left	13
them	13
but	13
to	13
die,	13
Wearied	13
and	13
few	13
the	13
last	13
defenders	13
fell.	13
And	13
this	13
same	13
arid	13
soil	13
hath	13
ever	13
been	13
A	13
haunt	13
of	13
countless	13
mournful	13
memories,	13
As	13
well	13
in	13
our	13
day	13
as	13
in	13
days	13
of	13
yore.	13
But	13
never	13
yet	13
to	13
Heaven	13
it	13
sent,	13
I	13
ween,	13
From	13
its	13
hard	13
bosom	13
purer	13
souls	13
than	13
these,	13
Or	13
braver	13
bodies	13
on	13
its	13
surface	13
bore.”	13
The	13
sonnets	13
were	13
not	13
disliked,	13
and	13
the	13
captive	13
was	13
rejoiced	13
at	13
the	13
tidings	13
they	13
gave	13
him	13
of	13
his	13
comrade,	13
and	13
continuing	13
his	13
tale,	13
he	13
went	13
on	13
to	13
say:	13
The	13
Goletta	13
and	13
the	13
fort	13
being	13
thus	13
in	13
their	13
hands,	13
the	13
Turks	13
gave	13
orders	13
to	13
dismantle	13
the	13
Goletta—for	13
the	13
fort	13
was	13
reduced	13
to	13
such	13
a	13
state	13
that	13
there	13
was	13
nothing	13
left	13
to	13
level—and	13
to	13
do	13
the	13
work	13
more	13
quickly	13
and	13
easily	13
they	13
mined	13
it	13
in	13
three	13
places;	13
but	13
nowhere	13
were	13
they	13
able	13
to	13
blow	13
up	13
the	13
part	13
which	13
seemed	13
to	13
be	13
the	13
least	13
strong,	13
that	13
is	13
to	13
say,	13
the	13
old	13
walls,	13
while	13
all	13
that	13
remained	13
standing	13
of	13
the	13
new	13
fortifications	13
that	13
the	13
Fratin	13
had	13
made	13
came	13
to	13
the	13
ground	13
with	13
the	13
greatest	13
ease.	13
Finally	13
the	13
fleet	13
returned	13
victorious	13
and	13
triumphant	13
to	13
Constantinople,	13
and	13
a	13
few	13
months	13
later	13
died	13
my	13
master,	13
El	13
Uchali,	13
otherwise	13
Uchali	13
Fartax,	13
which	13
means	13
in	13
Turkish	13
“the	13
scabby	13
renegade;”	13
for	13
that	13
he	13
was;	13
it	13
is	13
the	13
practice	13
with	13
the	13
Turks	13
to	13
name	13
people	13
from	13
some	13
defect	13
or	13
virtue	13
they	13
may	13
possess;	13
the	13
reason	13
being	13
that	13
there	13
are	13
among	13
them	13
only	13
four	13
surnames	13
belonging	13
to	13
families	13
tracing	13
their	13
descent	13
from	13
the	13
Ottoman	13
house,	13
and	13
the	13
others,	13
as	13
I	13
have	13
said,	13
take	13
their	13
names	13
and	13
surnames	13
either	13
from	13
bodily	13
blemishes	13
or	13
moral	13
qualities.	13
This	13
“scabby	13
one”	13
rowed	13
at	13
the	13
oar	13
as	13
a	13
slave	13
of	13
the	13
Grand	13
Signor’s	13
for	13
fourteen	13
years,	13
and	13
when	13
over	13
thirty-four	13
years	13
of	13
age,	13
in	13
resentment	13
at	13
having	13
been	13
struck	13
by	13
a	13
Turk	13
while	13
at	13
the	13
oar,	13
turned	13
renegade	13
and	13
renounced	13
his	13
faith	13
in	13
order	13
to	13
be	13
able	13
to	13
revenge	13
himself;	13
and	13
such	13
was	13
his	13
valour	13
that,	13
without	13
owing	13
his	13
advancement	13
to	13
the	13
base	13
ways	13
and	13
means	13
by	13
which	13
most	13
favourites	13
of	13
the	13
Grand	13
Signor	13
rise	13
to	13
power,	13
he	13
came	13
to	13
be	13
king	13
of	13
Algiers,	13
and	13
afterwards	13
general-on-sea,	13
which	13
is	13
the	13
third	13
place	13
of	13
trust	13
in	13
the	13
realm.	13
He	13
was	13
a	13
Calabrian	13
by	13
birth,	13
and	13
a	13
worthy	13
man	13
morally,	13
and	13
he	13
treated	13
his	13
slaves	13
with	13
great	13
humanity.	13
He	13
had	13
three	13
thousand	13
of	13
them,	13
and	13
after	13
his	13
death	13
they	13
were	13
divided,	13
as	13
he	13
directed	13
by	13
his	13
will,	13
between	13
the	13
Grand	13
Signor	13
(who	13
is	13
heir	13
of	13
all	13
who	13
die	13
and	13
shares	13
with	13
the	13
children	13
of	13
the	13
deceased)	13
and	13
his	13
renegades.	13
I	13
fell	13
to	13
the	13
lot	13
of	13
a	13
Venetian	13
renegade	13
who,	13
when	13
a	13
cabin	13
boy	13
on	13
board	13
a	13
ship,	13
had	13
been	13
taken	13
by	13
Uchali	13
and	13
was	13
so	13
much	13
beloved	13
by	13
him	13
that	13
he	13
became	13
one	13
of	13
his	13
most	13
favoured	13
youths.	13
He	13
came	13
to	13
be	13
the	13
most	13
cruel	13
renegade	13
I	13
ever	13
saw:	13
his	13
name	13
was	13
Hassan	13
Aga,	13
and	13
he	13
grew	13
very	13
rich	13
and	13
became	13
king	13
of	13
Algiers.	13
With	13
him	13
I	13
went	13
there	13
from	13
Constantinople,	13
rather	13
glad	13
to	13
be	13
so	13
near	13
Spain,	13
not	13
that	13
I	13
intended	13
to	13
write	13
to	13
anyone	13
about	13
my	13
unhappy	13
lot,	13
but	13
to	13
try	13
if	13
fortune	13
would	13
be	13
kinder	13
to	13
me	13
in	13
Algiers	13
than	13
in	13
Constantinople,	13
where	13
I	13
had	13
attempted	13
in	13
a	13
thousand	13
ways	13
to	13
escape	13
without	13
ever	13
finding	13
a	13
favourable	13
time	13
or	13
chance;	13
but	13
in	13
Algiers	13
I	13
resolved	13
to	13
seek	13
for	13
other	13
means	13
of	13
effecting	13
the	13
purpose	13
I	13
cherished	13
so	13
dearly;	13
for	13
the	13
hope	13
of	13
obtaining	13
my	13
liberty	13
never	13
deserted	13
me;	13
and	13
when	13
in	13
my	13
plots	13
and	13
schemes	13
and	13
attempts	13
the	13
result	13
did	13
not	13
answer	13
my	13
expectations,	13
without	13
giving	13
way	13
to	13
despair	13
I	13
immediately	13
began	13
to	13
look	13
out	13
for	13
or	13
conjure	13
up	13
some	13
new	13
hope	13
to	13
support	13
me,	13
however	13
faint	13
or	13
feeble	13
it	13
might	13
be.	13
In	13
this	13
way	13
I	13
lived	13
on	13
immured	13
in	13
a	13
building	13
or	13
prison	13
called	13
by	13
the	13
Turks	13
a	13
baño	13
in	13
which	13
they	13
confine	13
the	13
Christian	13
captives,	13
as	13
well	13
those	13
that	13
are	13
the	13
king’s	13
as	13
those	13
belonging	13
to	13
private	13
individuals,	13
and	13
also	13
what	13
they	13
call	13
those	13
of	13
the	13
Almacen,	13
which	13
is	13
as	13
much	13
as	13
to	13
say	13
the	13
slaves	13
of	13
the	13
municipality,	13
who	13
serve	13
the	13
city	13
in	13
the	13
public	13
works	13
and	13
other	13
employments;	13
but	13
captives	13
of	13
this	13
kind	13
recover	13
their	13
liberty	13
with	13
great	13
difficulty,	13
for,	13
as	13
they	13
are	13
public	13
property	13
and	13
have	13
no	13
particular	13
master,	13
there	13
is	13
no	13
one	13
with	13
whom	13
to	13
treat	13
for	13
their	13
ransom,	13
even	13
though	13
they	13
may	13
have	13
the	13
means.	13
To	13
these	13
baños,	13
as	13
I	13
have	13
said,	13
some	13
private	13
individuals	13
of	13
the	13
town	13
are	13
in	13
the	13
habit	13
of	13
bringing	13
their	13
captives,	13
especially	13
when	13
they	13
are	13
to	13
be	13
ransomed;	13
because	13
there	13
they	13
can	13
keep	13
them	13
in	13
safety	13
and	13
comfort	13
until	13
their	13
ransom	13
arrives.	13
The	13
king’s	13
captives	13
also,	13
that	13
are	13
on	13
ransom,	13
do	13
not	13
go	13
out	13
to	13
work	13
with	13
the	13
rest	13
of	13
the	13
crew,	13
unless	13
when	13
their	13
ransom	13
is	13
delayed;	13
for	13
then,	13
to	13
make	13
them	13
write	13
for	13
it	13
more	13
pressingly,	13
they	13
compel	13
them	13
to	13
work	13
and	13
go	13
for	13
wood,	13
which	13
is	13
no	13
light	13
labour.	13
I,	13
however,	13
was	13
one	13
of	13
those	13
on	13
ransom,	13
for	13
when	13
it	13
was	13
discovered	13
that	13
I	13
was	13
a	13
captain,	13
although	13
I	13
declared	13
my	13
scanty	13
means	13
and	13
want	13
of	13
fortune,	13
nothing	13
could	13
dissuade	13
them	13
from	13
including	13
me	13
among	13
the	13
gentlemen	13
and	13
those	13
waiting	13
to	13
be	13
ransomed.	13
They	13
put	13
a	13
chain	13
on	13
me,	13
more	13
as	13
a	13
mark	13
of	13
this	13
than	13
to	13
keep	13
me	13
safe,	13
and	13
so	13
I	13
passed	13
my	13
life	13
in	13
that	13
baño	13
with	13
several	13
other	13
gentlemen	13
and	13
persons	13
of	13
quality	13
marked	13
out	13
as	13
held	13
to	13
ransom;	13
but	13
though	13
at	13
times,	13
or	13
rather	13
almost	13
always,	13
we	13
suffered	13
from	13
hunger	13
and	13
scanty	13
clothing,	13
nothing	13
distressed	13
us	13
so	13
much	13
as	13
hearing	13
and	13
seeing	13
at	13
every	13
turn	13
the	13
unexampled	13
and	13
unheard-of	13
cruelties	13
my	13
master	13
inflicted	13
upon	13
the	13
Christians.	13
Every	13
day	13
he	13
hanged	13
a	13
man,	13
impaled	13
one,	13
cut	13
off	13
the	13
ears	13
of	13
another;	13
and	13
all	13
with	13
so	13
little	13
provocation,	13
or	13
so	13
entirely	13
without	13
any,	13
that	13
the	13
Turks	13
acknowledged	13
he	13
did	13
it	13
merely	13
for	13
the	13
sake	13
of	13
doing	13
it,	13
and	13
because	13
he	13
was	13
by	13
nature	13
murderously	13
disposed	13
towards	13
the	13
whole	13
human	13
race.	13
The	13
only	13
one	13
that	13
fared	13
at	13
all	13
well	13
with	13
him	13
was	13
a	13
Spanish	13
soldier,	13
something	13
de	13
Saavedra	13
by	13
name,	13
to	13
whom	13
he	13
never	13
gave	13
a	13
blow	13
himself,	13
or	13
ordered	13
a	13
blow	13
to	13
be	13
given,	13
or	13
addressed	13
a	13
hard	13
word,	13
although	13
he	13
had	13
done	13
things	13
that	13
will	13
dwell	13
in	13
the	13
memory	13
of	13
the	13
people	13
there	13
for	13
many	13
a	13
year,	13
and	13
all	13
to	13
recover	13
his	13
liberty;	13
and	13
for	13
the	13
least	13
of	13
the	13
many	13
things	13
he	13
did	13
we	13
all	13
dreaded	13
that	13
he	13
would	13
be	13
impaled,	13
and	13
he	13
himself	13
was	13
in	13
fear	13
of	13
it	13
more	13
than	13
once;	13
and	13
only	13
that	13
time	13
does	13
not	13
allow,	13
I	13
could	13
tell	13
you	13
now	13
something	13
of	13
what	13
that	13
soldier	13
did,	13
that	13
would	13
interest	13
and	13
astonish	13
you	13
much	13
more	13
than	13
the	13
narration	13
of	13
my	13
own	13
tale.	13
To	13
go	13
on	13
with	13
my	13
story;	13
the	13
courtyard	13
of	13
our	13
prison	13
was	13
overlooked	13
by	13
the	13
windows	13
of	13
the	13
house	13
belonging	13
to	13
a	13
wealthy	13
Moor	13
of	13
high	13
position;	13
and	13
these,	13
as	13
is	13
usual	13
in	13
Moorish	13
houses,	13
were	13
rather	13
loopholes	13
than	13
windows,	13
and	13
besides	13
were	13
covered	13
with	13
thick	13
and	13
close	13
lattice-work.	13
It	13
so	13
happened,	13
then,	13
that	13
as	13
I	13
was	13
one	13
day	13
on	13
the	13
terrace	13
of	13
our	13
prison	13
with	13
three	13
other	13
comrades,	13
trying,	13
to	13
pass	13
away	13
the	13
time,	13
how	13
far	13
we	13
could	13
leap	13
with	13
our	13
chains,	13
we	13
being	13
alone,	13
for	13
all	13
the	13
other	13
Christians	13
had	13
gone	13
out	13
to	13
work,	13
I	13
chanced	13
to	13
raise	13
my	13
eyes,	13
and	13
from	13
one	13
of	13
these	13
little	13
closed	13
windows	13
I	13
saw	13
a	13
reed	13
appear	13
with	13
a	13
cloth	13
attached	13
to	13
the	13
end	13
of	13
it,	13
and	13
it	13
kept	13
waving	13
to	13
and	13
fro,	13
and	13
moving	13
as	13
if	13
making	13
signs	13
to	13
us	13
to	13
come	13
and	13
take	13
it.	13
We	13
watched	13
it,	13
and	13
one	13
of	13
those	13
who	13
were	13
with	13
me	13
went	13
and	13
stood	13
under	13
the	13
reed	13
to	13
see	13
whether	13
they	13
would	13
let	13
it	13
drop,	13
or	13
what	13
they	13
would	13
do,	13
but	13
as	13
he	13
did	13
so	13
the	13
reed	13
was	13
raised	13
and	13
moved	13
from	13
side	13
to	13
side,	13
as	13
if	13
they	13
meant	13
to	13
say	13
“no”	13
by	13
a	13
shake	13
of	13
the	13
head.	13
The	13
Christian	13
came	13
back,	13
and	13
it	13
was	13
again	13
lowered,	13
making	13
the	13
same	13
movements	13
as	13
before.	13
Another	13
of	13
my	13
comrades	13
went,	13
and	13
with	13
him	13
the	13
same	13
happened	13
as	13
with	13
the	13
first,	13
and	13
then	13
the	13
third	13
went	13
forward,	13
but	13
with	13
the	13
same	13
result	13
as	13
the	13
first	13
and	13
second.	13
Seeing	13
this	13
I	13
did	13
not	13
like	13
not	13
to	13
try	13
my	13
luck,	13
and	13
as	13
soon	13
as	13
I	13
came	13
under	13
the	13
reed	13
it	13
was	13
dropped	13
and	13
fell	13
inside	13
the	13
baño	13
at	13
my	13
feet.	13
I	13
hastened	13
to	13
untie	13
the	13
cloth,	13
in	13
which	13
I	13
perceived	13
a	13
knot,	13
and	13
in	13
this	13
were	13
ten	13
cianis,	13
which	13
are	13
coins	13
of	13
base	13
gold,	13
current	13
among	13
the	13
Moors,	13
and	13
each	13
worth	13
ten	13
reals	13
of	13
our	13
money.	13
It	13
is	13
needless	13
to	13
say	13
I	13
rejoiced	13
over	13
this	13
godsend,	13
and	13
my	13
joy	13
was	13
not	13
less	13
than	13
my	13
wonder	13
as	13
I	13
strove	13
to	13
imagine	13
how	13
this	13
good	13
fortune	13
could	13
have	13
come	13
to	13
us,	13
but	13
to	13
me	13
specially;	13
for	13
the	13
evident	13
unwillingness	13
to	13
drop	13
the	13
reed	13
for	13
any	13
but	13
me	13
showed	13
that	13
it	13
was	13
for	13
me	13
the	13
favour	13
was	13
intended.	13
I	13
took	13
my	13
welcome	13
money,	13
broke	13
the	13
reed,	13
and	13
returned	13
to	13
the	13
terrace,	13
and	13
looking	13
up	13
at	13
the	13
window,	13
I	13
saw	13
a	13
very	13
white	13
hand	13
put	13
out	13
that	13
opened	13
and	13
shut	13
very	13
quickly.	13
From	13
this	13
we	13
gathered	13
or	13
fancied	13
that	13
it	13
must	13
be	13
some	13
woman	13
living	13
in	13
that	13
house	13
that	13
had	13
done	13
us	13
this	13
kindness,	13
and	13
to	13
show	13
that	13
we	13
were	13
grateful	13
for	13
it,	13
we	13
made	13
salaams	13
after	13
the	13
fashion	13
of	13
the	13
Moors,	13
bowing	13
the	13
head,	13
bending	13
the	13
body,	13
and	13
crossing	13
the	13
arms	13
on	13
the	13
breast.	13
Shortly	13
afterwards	13
at	13
the	13
same	13
window	13
a	13
small	13
cross	13
made	13
of	13
reeds	13
was	13
put	13
out	13
and	13
immediately	13
withdrawn.	13
This	13
sign	13
led	13
us	13
to	13
believe	13
that	13
some	13
Christian	13
woman	13
was	13
a	13
captive	13
in	13
the	13
house,	13
and	13
that	13
it	13
was	13
she	13
who	13
had	13
been	13
so	13
good	13
to	13
us;	13
but	13
the	13
whiteness	13
of	13
the	13
hand	13
and	13
the	13
bracelets	13
we	13
had	13
perceived	13
made	13
us	13
dismiss	13
that	13
idea,	13
though	13
we	13
thought	13
it	13
might	13
be	13
one	13
of	13
the	13
Christian	13
renegades	13
whom	13
their	13
masters	13
very	13
often	13
take	13
as	13
lawful	13
wives,	13
and	13
gladly,	13
for	13
they	13
prefer	13
them	13
to	13
the	13
women	13
of	13
their	13
own	13
nation.	13
In	13
all	13
our	13
conjectures	13
we	13
were	13
wide	13
of	13
the	13
truth;	13
so	13
from	13
that	13
time	13
forward	13
our	13
sole	13
occupation	13
was	13
watching	13
and	13
gazing	13
at	13
the	13
window	13
where	13
the	13
cross	13
had	13
appeared	13
to	13
us,	13
as	13
if	13
it	13
were	13
our	13
pole-star;	13
but	13
at	13
least	13
fifteen	13
days	13
passed	13
without	13
our	13
seeing	13
either	13
it	13
or	13
the	13
hand,	13
or	13
any	13
other	13
sign	13
and	13
though	13
meanwhile	13
we	13
endeavoured	13
with	13
the	13
utmost	13
pains	13
to	13
ascertain	13
who	13
it	13
was	13
that	13
lived	13
in	13
the	13
house,	13
and	13
whether	13
there	13
were	13
any	13
Christian	13
renegade	13
in	13
it,	13
nobody	13
could	13
ever	13
tell	13
us	13
anything	13
more	13
than	13
that	13
he	13
who	13
lived	13
there	13
was	13
a	13
rich	13
Moor	13
of	13
high	13
position,	13
Hadji	13
Morato	13
by	13
name,	13
formerly	13
alcaide	13
of	13
La	13
Pata,	13
an	13
office	13
of	13
high	13
dignity	13
among	13
them.	13
But	13
when	13
we	13
least	13
thought	13
it	13
was	13
going	13
to	13
rain	13
any	13
more	13
cianis	13
from	13
that	13
quarter,	13
we	13
saw	13
the	13
reed	13
suddenly	13
appear	13
with	13
another	13
cloth	13
tied	13
in	13
a	13
larger	13
knot	13
attached	13
to	13
it,	13
and	13
this	13
at	13
a	13
time	13
when,	13
as	13
on	13
the	13
former	13
occasion,	13
the	13
baño	13
was	13
deserted	13
and	13
unoccupied.	13

We	13
made	13
trial	13
as	13
before,	13
each	13
of	13
the	13
same	13
three	13
going	13
forward	13
before	13
I	13
did;	13
but	13
the	13
reed	13
was	13
delivered	13
to	13
none	13
but	13
me,	13
and	13
on	13
my	13
approach	13
it	13
was	13
let	13
drop.	13
I	13
untied	13
the	13
knot	13
and	13
I	13
found	13
forty	13
Spanish	13
gold	13
crowns	13
with	13
a	13
paper	13
written	13
in	13
Arabic,	13
and	13
at	13
the	13
end	13
of	13
the	13
writing	13
there	13
was	13
a	13
large	13
cross	13
drawn.	13
I	13
kissed	13
the	13
cross,	13
took	13
the	13
crowns	13
and	13
returned	13
to	13
the	13
terrace,	13
and	13
we	13
all	13
made	13
our	13
salaams;	13
again	13
the	13
hand	13
appeared,	13
I	13
made	13
signs	13
that	13
I	13
would	13
read	13
the	13
paper,	13
and	13
then	13
the	13
window	13
was	13
closed.	13
We	13
were	13
all	13
puzzled,	13
though	13
filled	13
with	13
joy	13
at	13
what	13
had	13
taken	13
place;	13
and	13
as	13
none	13
of	13
us	13
understood	13
Arabic,	13
great	13
was	13
our	13
curiosity	13
to	13
know	13
what	13
the	13
paper	13
contained,	13
and	13
still	13
greater	13
the	13
difficulty	13
of	13
finding	13
someone	13
to	13
read	13
it.	13
At	13
last	13
I	13
resolved	13
to	13
confide	13
in	13
a	13
renegade,	13
a	13
native	13
of	13
Murcia,	13
who	13
professed	13
a	13
very	13
great	13
friendship	13
for	13
me,	13
and	13
had	13
given	13
pledges	13
that	13
bound	13
him	13
to	13
keep	13
any	13
secret	13
I	13
might	13
entrust	13
to	13
him;	13
for	13
it	13
is	13
the	13
custom	13
with	13
some	13
renegades,	13
when	13
they	13
intend	13
to	13
return	13
to	13
Christian	13
territory,	13
to	13
carry	13
about	13
them	13
certificates	13
from	13
captives	13
of	13
mark	13
testifying,	13
in	13
whatever	13
form	13
they	13
can,	13
that	13
such	13
and	13
such	13
a	13
renegade	13
is	13
a	13
worthy	13
man	13
who	13
has	13
always	13
shown	13
kindness	13
to	13
Christians,	13
and	13
is	13
anxious	13
to	13
escape	13
on	13
the	13
first	13
opportunity	13
that	13
may	13
present	13
itself.	13
Some	13
obtain	13
these	13
testimonials	13
with	13
good	13
intentions,	13
others	13
put	13
them	13
to	13
a	13
cunning	13
use;	13
for	13
when	13
they	13
go	13
to	13
pillage	13
on	13
Christian	13
territory,	13
if	13
they	13
chance	13
to	13
be	13
cast	13
away,	13
or	13
taken	13
prisoners,	13
they	13
produce	13
their	13
certificates	13
and	13
say	13
that	13
from	13
these	13
papers	13
may	13
be	13
seen	13
the	13
object	13
they	13
came	13
for,	13
which	13
was	13
to	13
remain	13
on	13
Christian	13
ground,	13
and	13
that	13
it	13
was	13
to	13
this	13
end	13
they	13
joined	13
the	13
Turks	13
in	13
their	13
foray.	13
In	13
this	13
way	13
they	13
escape	13
the	13
consequences	13
of	13
the	13
first	13
outburst	13
and	13
make	13
their	13
peace	13
with	13
the	13
Church	13
before	13
it	13
does	13
them	13
any	13
harm,	13
and	13
then	13
when	13
they	13
have	13
the	13
chance	13
they	13
return	13
to	13
Barbary	13
to	13
become	13
what	13
they	13
were	13
before.	13
Others,	13
however,	13
there	13
are	13
who	13
procure	13
these	13
papers	13
and	13
make	13
use	13
of	13
them	13
honestly,	13
and	13
remain	13
on	13
Christian	13
soil.	13
This	13
friend	13
of	13
mine,	13
then,	13
was	13
one	13
of	13
these	13
renegades	13
that	13
I	13
have	13
described;	13
he	13
had	13
certificates	13
from	13
all	13
our	13
comrades,	13
in	13
which	13
we	13
testified	13
in	13
his	13
favour	13
as	13
strongly	13
as	13
we	13
could;	13
and	13
if	13
the	13
Moors	13
had	13
found	13
the	13
papers	13
they	13
would	13
have	13
burned	13
him	13
alive.	13
I	13
knew	13
that	13
he	13
understood	13
Arabic	13
very	13
well,	13
and	13
could	13
not	13
only	13
speak	13
but	13
also	13
write	13
it;	13
but	13
before	13
I	13
disclosed	13
the	13
whole	13
matter	13
to	13
him,	13
I	13
asked	13
him	13
to	13
read	13
for	13
me	13
this	13
paper	13
which	13
I	13
had	13
found	13
by	13
accident	13
in	13
a	13
hole	13
in	13
my	13
cell.	13
He	13
opened	13
it	13
and	13
remained	13
some	13
time	13
examining	13
it	13
and	13
muttering	13
to	13
himself	13
as	13
he	13
translated	13
it.	13
I	13
asked	13
him	13
if	13
he	13
understood	13
it,	13
and	13
he	13
told	13
me	13
he	13
did	13
perfectly	13
well,	13
and	13
that	13
if	13
I	13
wished	13
him	13
to	13
tell	13
me	13
its	13
meaning	13
word	13
for	13
word,	13
I	13
must	13
give	13
him	13
pen	13
and	13
ink	13
that	13
he	13
might	13
do	13
it	13
more	13
satisfactorily.	13
We	13
at	13
once	13
gave	13
him	13
what	13
he	13
required,	13
and	13
he	13
set	13
about	13
translating	13
it	13
bit	13
by	13
bit,	13
and	13
when	13
he	13
had	13
done	13
he	13
said:	13
“All	13
that	13
is	13
here	13
in	13
Spanish	13
is	13
what	13
the	13
Moorish	13
paper	13
contains,	13
and	13
you	13
must	13
bear	13
in	13
mind	13
that	13
when	13
it	13
says	13
‘Lela	13
Marien’	13
it	13
means	13
‘Our	13
Lady	13
the	13
Virgin	13
Mary.’”	13
We	13
read	13
the	13
paper	13
and	13
it	13
ran	13
thus:	13
“When	13
I	13
was	13
a	13
child	13
my	13
father	13
had	13
a	13
slave	13
who	13
taught	13
me	13
to	13
pray	13
the	13
Christian	13
prayer	13
in	13
my	13
own	13
language,	13
and	13
told	13
me	13
many	13
things	13
about	13
Lela	13
Marien.	13
The	13
Christian	13
died,	13
and	13
I	13
know	13
that	13
she	13
did	13
not	13
go	13
to	13
the	13
fire,	13
but	13
to	13
Allah,	13
because	13
since	13
then	13
I	13
have	13
seen	13
her	13
twice,	13
and	13
she	13
told	13
me	13
to	13
go	13
to	13
the	13
land	13
of	13
the	13
Christians	13
to	13
see	13
Lela	13
Marien,	13
who	13
had	13
great	13
love	13
for	13
me.	13
I	13
know	13
not	13
how	13
to	13
go.	13
I	13
have	13
seen	13
many	13
Christians,	13
but	13
except	13
thyself	13
none	13
has	13
seemed	13
to	13
me	13
to	13
be	13
a	13
gentleman.	13
I	13
am	13
young	13
and	13
beautiful,	13
and	13
have	13
plenty	13
of	13
money	13
to	13
take	13
with	13
me.	13
See	13
if	13
thou	13
canst	13
contrive	13
how	13
we	13
may	13
go,	13
and	13
if	13
thou	13
wilt	13
thou	13
shalt	13
be	13
my	13
husband	13
there,	13
and	13
if	13
thou	13
wilt	13
not	13
it	13
will	13
not	13
distress	13
me,	13
for	13
Lela	13
Marien	13
will	13
find	13
me	13
someone	13
to	13
marry	13
me.	13
I	13
myself	13
have	13
written	13
this:	13
have	13
a	13
care	13
to	13
whom	13
thou	13
givest	13
it	13
to	13
read:	13
trust	13
no	13
Moor,	13
for	13
they	13
are	13
all	13
perfidious.	13
I	13
am	13
greatly	13
troubled	13
on	13
this	13
account,	13
for	13
I	13
would	13
not	13
have	13
thee	13
confide	13
in	13
anyone,	13
because	13
if	13
my	13
father	13
knew	13
it	13
he	13
would	13
at	13
once	13
fling	13
me	13
down	13
a	13
well	13
and	13
cover	13
me	13
with	13
stones.	13
I	13
will	13
put	13
a	13
thread	13
to	13
the	13
reed;	13
tie	13
the	13
answer	13
to	13
it,	13
and	13
if	13
thou	13
hast	13
no	13
one	13
to	13
write	13
for	13
thee	13
in	13
Arabic,	13
tell	13
it	13
to	13
me	13
by	13
signs,	13
for	13
Lela	13
Marien	13
will	13
make	13
me	13
understand	13
thee.	13
She	13
and	13
Allah	13
and	13
this	13
cross,	13
which	13
I	13
often	13
kiss	13
as	13
the	13
captive	13
bade	13
me,	13
protect	13
thee.”	13
Judge,	13
sirs,	13
whether	13
we	13
had	13
reason	13
for	13
surprise	13
and	13
joy	13
at	13
the	13
words	13
of	13
this	13
paper;	13
and	13
both	13
one	13
and	13
the	13
other	13
were	13
so	13
great,	13
that	13
the	13
renegade	13
perceived	13
that	13
the	13
paper	13
had	13
not	13
been	13
found	13
by	13
chance,	13
but	13
had	13
been	13
in	13
reality	13
addressed	13
to	13
someone	13
of	13
us,	13
and	13
he	13
begged	13
us,	13
if	13
what	13
he	13
suspected	13
were	13
the	13
truth,	13
to	13
trust	13
him	13
and	13
tell	13
him	13
all,	13
for	13
he	13
would	13
risk	13
his	13
life	13
for	13
our	13
freedom;	13
and	13
so	13
saying	13
he	13
took	13
out	13
from	13
his	13
breast	13
a	13
metal	13
crucifix,	13
and	13
with	13
many	13
tears	13
swore	13
by	13
the	13
God	13
the	13
image	13
represented,	13
in	13
whom,	13
sinful	13
and	13
wicked	13
as	13
he	13
was,	13
he	13
truly	13
and	13
faithfully	13
believed,	13
to	13
be	13
loyal	13
to	13
us	13
and	13
keep	13
secret	13
whatever	13
we	13
chose	13
to	13
reveal	13
to	13
him;	13
for	13
he	13
thought	13
and	13
almost	13
foresaw	13
that	13
by	13
means	13
of	13
her	13
who	13
had	13
written	13
that	13
paper,	13
he	13
and	13
all	13
of	13
us	13
would	13
obtain	13
our	13
liberty,	13
and	13
he	13
himself	13
obtain	13
the	13
object	13
he	13
so	13
much	13
desired,	13
his	13
restoration	13
to	13
the	13
bosom	13
of	13
the	13
Holy	13
Mother	13
Church,	13
from	13
which	13
by	13
his	13
own	13
sin	13
and	13
ignorance	13
he	13
was	13
now	13
severed	13
like	13
a	13
corrupt	13
limb.	13
The	13
renegade	13
said	13
this	13
with	13
so	13
many	13
tears	13
and	13
such	13
signs	13
of	13
repentance,	13
that	13
with	13
one	13
consent	13
we	13
all	13
agreed	13
to	13
tell	13
him	13
the	13
whole	13
truth	13
of	13
the	13
matter,	13
and	13
so	13
we	13
gave	13
him	13
a	13
full	13
account	13
of	13
all,	13
without	13
hiding	13
anything	13
from	13
him.	13
We	13
pointed	13
out	13
to	13
him	13
the	13
window	13
at	13
which	13
the	13
reed	13
appeared,	13
and	13
he	13
by	13
that	13
means	13
took	13
note	13
of	13
the	13
house,	13
and	13
resolved	13
to	13
ascertain	13
with	13
particular	13
care	13
who	13
lived	13
in	13
it.	13
We	13
agreed	13
also	13
that	13
it	13
would	13
be	13
advisable	13
to	13
answer	13
the	13
Moorish	13
lady’s	13
letter,	13
and	13
the	13
renegade	13
without	13
a	13
moment’s	13
delay	13
took	13
down	13
the	13
words	13
I	13
dictated	13
to	13
him,	13
which	13
were	13
exactly	13
what	13
I	13
shall	13
tell	13
you,	13
for	13
nothing	13
of	13
importance	13
that	13
took	13
place	13
in	13
this	13
affair	13
has	13
escaped	13
my	13
memory,	13
or	13
ever	13
will	13
while	13
life	13
lasts.	13
This,	13
then,	13
was	13
the	13
answer	13
returned	13
to	13
the	13
Moorish	13
lady:	13
“The	13
true	13
Allah	13
protect	13
thee,	13
Lady,	13
and	13
that	13
blessed	13
Marien	13
who	13
is	13
the	13
true	13
mother	13
of	13
God,	13
and	13
who	13
has	13
put	13
it	13
into	13
thy	13
heart	13
to	13
go	13
to	13
the	13
land	13
of	13
the	13
Christians,	13
because	13
she	13
loves	13
thee.	13
Entreat	13
her	13
that	13
she	13
be	13
pleased	13
to	13
show	13
thee	13
how	13
thou	13
canst	13
execute	13
the	13
command	13
she	13
gives	13
thee,	13
for	13
she	13
will,	13
such	13
is	13
her	13
goodness.	13
On	13
my	13
own	13
part,	13
and	13
on	13
that	13
of	13
all	13
these	13
Christians	13
who	13
are	13
with	13
me,	13
I	13
promise	13
to	13
do	13
all	13
that	13
we	13
can	13
for	13
thee,	13
even	13
to	13
death.	13
Fail	13
not	13
to	13
write	13
to	13
me	13
and	13
inform	13
me	13
what	13
thou	13
dost	13
mean	13
to	13
do,	13
and	13
I	13
will	13
always	13
answer	13
thee;	13
for	13
the	13
great	13
Allah	13
has	13
given	13
us	13
a	13
Christian	13
captive	13
who	13
can	13
speak	13
and	13
write	13
thy	13
language	13
well,	13
as	13
thou	13
mayest	13
see	13
by	13
this	13
paper;	13
without	13
fear,	13
therefore,	13
thou	13
canst	13
inform	13
us	13
of	13
all	13
thou	13
wouldst.	13
As	13
to	13
what	13
thou	13
sayest,	13
that	13
if	13
thou	13
dost	13
reach	13
the	13
land	13
of	13
the	13
Christians	13
thou	13
wilt	13
be	13
my	13
wife,	13
I	13
give	13
thee	13
my	13
promise	13
upon	13
it	13
as	13
a	13
good	13
Christian;	13
and	13
know	13
that	13
the	13
Christians	13
keep	13
their	13
promises	13
better	13
than	13
the	13
Moors.	13
Allah	13
and	13
Marien	13
his	13
mother	13
watch	13
over	13
thee,	13
my	13
Lady.”	13
The	13
paper	13
being	13
written	13
and	13
folded	13
I	13
waited	13
two	13
days	13
until	13
the	13
baño	13
was	13
empty	13
as	13
before,	13
and	13
immediately	13
repaired	13
to	13
the	13
usual	13
walk	13
on	13
the	13
terrace	13
to	13
see	13
if	13
there	13
were	13
any	13
sign	13
of	13
the	13
reed,	13
which	13
was	13
not	13
long	13
in	13
making	13
its	13
appearance.	13
As	13
soon	13
as	13
I	13
saw	13
it,	13
although	13
I	13
could	13
not	13
distinguish	13
who	13
put	13
it	13
out,	13
I	13
showed	13
the	13
paper	13
as	13
a	13
sign	13
to	13
attach	13
the	13
thread,	13
but	13
it	13
was	13
already	13
fixed	13
to	13
the	13
reed,	13
and	13
to	13
it	13
I	13
tied	13
the	13
paper;	13
and	13
shortly	13
afterwards	13
our	13
star	13
once	13
more	13
made	13
its	13
appearance	13
with	13
the	13
white	13
flag	13
of	13
peace,	13
the	13
little	13
bundle.	13
It	13
was	13
dropped,	13
and	13
I	13
picked	13
it	13
up,	13
and	13
found	13
in	13
the	13
cloth,	13
in	13
gold	13
and	13
silver	13
coins	13
of	13
all	13
sorts,	13
more	13
than	13
fifty	13
crowns,	13
which	13
fifty	13
times	13
more	13
strengthened	13
our	13
joy	13
and	13
doubled	13
our	13
hope	13
of	13
gaining	13
our	13
liberty.	13
That	13
very	13
night	13
our	13
renegade	13
returned	13
and	13
said	13
he	13
had	13
learned	13
that	13
the	13
Moor	13
we	13
had	13
been	13
told	13
of	13
lived	13
in	13
that	13
house,	13
that	13
his	13
name	13
was	13
Hadji	13
Morato,	13
that	13
he	13
was	13
enormously	13
rich,	13
that	13
he	13
had	13
one	13
only	13
daughter	13
the	13
heiress	13
of	13
all	13
his	13
wealth,	13
and	13
that	13
it	13
was	13
the	13
general	13
opinion	13
throughout	13
the	13
city	13
that	13
she	13
was	13
the	13
most	13
beautiful	13
woman	13
in	13
Barbary,	13
and	13
that	13
several	13
of	13
the	13
viceroys	13
who	13
came	13
there	13
had	13
sought	13
her	13
for	13
a	13
wife,	13
but	13
that	13
she	13
had	13
been	13
always	13
unwilling	13
to	13
marry;	13
and	13
he	13
had	13
learned,	13
moreover,	13
that	13
she	13
had	13
a	13
Christian	13
slave	13
who	13
was	13
now	13
dead;	13
all	13
which	13
agreed	13
with	13
the	13
contents	13
of	13
the	13
paper.	13
We	13
immediately	13
took	13
counsel	13
with	13
the	13
renegade	13
as	13
to	13
what	13
means	13
would	13
have	13
to	13
be	13
adopted	13
in	13
order	13
to	13
carry	13
off	13
the	13
Moorish	13
lady	13
and	13
bring	13
us	13
all	13
to	13
Christian	13
territory;	13
and	13
in	13
the	13
end	13
it	13
was	13
agreed	13
that	13
for	13
the	13
present	13
we	13
should	13
wait	13
for	13
a	13
second	13
communication	13
from	13
Zoraida	13
(for	13
that	13
was	13
the	13
name	13
of	13
her	13
who	13
now	13
desires	13
to	13
be	13
called	13
Maria),	13
because	13
we	13
saw	13
clearly	13
that	13
she	13
and	13
no	13
one	13
else	13
could	13
find	13
a	13
way	13
out	13
of	13
all	13
these	13
difficulties.	13
When	13
we	13
had	13
decided	13
upon	13
this	13
the	13
renegade	13
told	13
us	13
not	13
to	13
be	13
uneasy,	13
for	13
he	13
would	13
lose	13
his	13
life	13
or	13
restore	13
us	13
to	13
liberty.	13
For	13
four	13
days	13
the	13
baño	13
was	13
filled	13
with	13
people,	13
for	13
which	13
reason	13
the	13
reed	13
delayed	13
its	13
appearance	13
for	13
four	13
days,	13
but	13
at	13
the	13
end	13
of	13
that	13
time,	13
when	13
the	13
baño	13
was,	13
as	13
it	13
generally	13
was,	13
empty,	13
it	13
appeared	13
with	13
the	13
cloth	13
so	13
bulky	13
that	13
it	13
promised	13
a	13
happy	13
birth.	13
Reed	13
and	13
cloth	13
came	13
down	13
to	13
me,	13
and	13
I	13
found	13
another	13
paper	13
and	13
a	13
hundred	13
crowns	13
in	13
gold,	13
without	13
any	13
other	13
coin.	13
The	13
renegade	13
was	13
present,	13
and	13
in	13
our	13
cell	13
we	13
gave	13
him	13
the	13
paper	13
to	13
read,	13
which	13
was	13
to	13
this	13
effect:	13
“I	13
cannot	13
think	13
of	13
a	13
plan,	13
señor,	13
for	13
our	13
going	13
to	13
Spain,	13
nor	13
has	13
Lela	13
Marien	13
shown	13
me	13
one,	13
though	13
I	13
have	13
asked	13
her.	13
All	13
that	13
can	13
be	13
done	13
is	13
for	13
me	13
to	13
give	13
you	13
plenty	13
of	13
money	13
in	13
gold	13
from	13
this	13
window.	13
With	13
it	13
ransom	13
yourself	13
and	13
your	13
friends,	13
and	13
let	13
one	13
of	13
you	13
go	13
to	13
the	13
land	13
of	13
the	13
Christians,	13
and	13
there	13
buy	13
a	13
vessel	13
and	13
come	13
back	13
for	13
the	13
others;	13
and	13
he	13
will	13
find	13
me	13
in	13
my	13
father’s	13
garden,	13
which	13
is	13
at	13
the	13
Babazon	13
gate	13
near	13
the	13
seashore,	13
where	13
I	13
shall	13
be	13
all	13
this	13
summer	13
with	13
my	13
father	13
and	13
my	13
servants.	13
You	13
can	13
carry	13
me	13
away	13
from	13
there	13
by	13
night	13
without	13
any	13
danger,	13
and	13
bring	13
me	13
to	13
the	13
vessel.	13
And	13
remember	13
thou	13
art	13
to	13
be	13
my	13
husband,	13
else	13
I	13
will	13
pray	13
to	13
Marien	13
to	13
punish	13
thee.	13
If	13
thou	13
canst	13
not	13
trust	13
anyone	13
to	13
go	13
for	13
the	13
vessel,	13
ransom	13
thyself	13
and	13
do	13
thou	13
go,	13
for	13
I	13
know	13
thou	13
wilt	13
return	13
more	13
surely	13
than	13
any	13
other,	13
as	13
thou	13
art	13
a	13
gentleman	13
and	13
a	13
Christian.	13
Endeavour	13
to	13
make	13
thyself	13
acquainted	13
with	13
the	13
garden;	13
and	13
when	13
I	13
see	13
thee	13
walking	13
yonder	13
I	13
shall	13
know	13
that	13
the	13
baño	13
is	13
empty	13
and	13
I	13
will	13
give	13
thee	13
abundance	13
of	13
money.	13
Allah	13
protect	13
thee,	13
señor.”	13
These	13
were	13
the	13
words	13
and	13
contents	13
of	13
the	13
second	13
paper,	13
and	13
on	13
hearing	13
them,	13
each	13
declared	13
himself	13
willing	13
to	13
be	13
the	13
ransomed	13
one,	13
and	13
promised	13
to	13
go	13
and	13
return	13
with	13
scrupulous	13
good	13
faith;	13
and	13
I	13
too	13
made	13
the	13
same	13
offer;	13
but	13
to	13
all	13
this	13
the	13
renegade	13
objected,	13
saying	13
that	13
he	13
would	13
not	13
on	13
any	13
account	13
consent	13
to	13
one	13
being	13
set	13
free	13
before	13
all	13
went	13
together,	13
as	13
experience	13
had	13
taught	13
him	13
how	13
ill	13
those	13
who	13
have	13
been	13
set	13
free	13
keep	13
promises	13
which	13
they	13
made	13
in	13
captivity;	13
for	13
captives	13
of	13
distinction	13
frequently	13
had	13
recourse	13
to	13
this	13
plan,	13
paying	13
the	13
ransom	13
of	13
one	13
who	13
was	13
to	13
go	13
to	13
Valencia	13
or	13
Majorca	13
with	13
money	13
to	13
enable	13
him	13
to	13
arm	13
a	13
bark	13
and	13
return	13
for	13
the	13
others	13
who	13
had	13
ransomed	13
him,	13
but	13
who	13
never	13
came	13
back;	13
for	13
recovered	13
liberty	13
and	13
the	13
dread	13
of	13
losing	13
it	13
again	13
efface	13
from	13
the	13
memory	13
all	13
the	13
obligations	13
in	13
the	13
world.	13
And	13
to	13
prove	13
the	13
truth	13
of	13
what	13
he	13
said,	13
he	13
told	13
us	13
briefly	13
what	13
had	13
happened	13
to	13
a	13
certain	13
Christian	13
gentleman	13
almost	13
at	13
that	13
very	13
time,	13
the	13
strangest	13
case	13
that	13
had	13
ever	13
occurred	13
even	13
there,	13
where	13
astonishing	13
and	13
marvellous	13
things	13
are	13
happening	13
every	13
instant.	13
In	13
short,	13
he	13
ended	13
by	13
saying	13
that	13
what	13
could	13
and	13
ought	13
to	13
be	13
done	13
was	13
to	13
give	13
the	13
money	13
intended	13
for	13
the	13
ransom	13
of	13
one	13
of	13
us	13
Christians	13
to	13
him,	13
so	13
that	13
he	13
might	13
with	13
it	13
buy	13
a	13
vessel	13
there	13
in	13
Algiers	13
under	13
the	13
pretence	13
of	13
becoming	13
a	13
merchant	13
and	13
trader	13
at	13
Tetuan	13
and	13
along	13
the	13
coast;	13
and	13
when	13
master	13
of	13
the	13
vessel,	13
it	13
would	13
be	13
easy	13
for	13
him	13
to	13
hit	13
on	13
some	13
way	13
of	13
getting	13
us	13
all	13
out	13
of	13
the	13
baño	13
and	13
putting	13
us	13
on	13
board;	13
especially	13
if	13
the	13
Moorish	13
lady	13
gave,	13
as	13
she	13
said,	13
money	13
enough	13
to	13
ransom	13
all,	13
because	13
once	13
free	13
it	13
would	13
be	13
the	13
easiest	13
thing	13
in	13
the	13
world	13
for	13
us	13
to	13
embark	13
even	13
in	13
open	13
day;	13
but	13
the	13
greatest	13
difficulty	13
was	13
that	13
the	13
Moors	13
do	13
not	13
allow	13
any	13
renegade	13
to	13
buy	13
or	13
own	13
any	13
craft,	13
unless	13
it	13
be	13
a	13
large	13
vessel	13
for	13
going	13
on	13
roving	13
expeditions,	13
because	13
they	13
are	13
afraid	13
that	13
anyone	13
who	13
buys	13
a	13
small	13
vessel,	13
especially	13
if	13
he	13
be	13
a	13
Spaniard,	13
only	13
wants	13
it	13
for	13
the	13
purpose	13
of	13
escaping	13
to	13
Christian	13
territory.	13
This	13
however	13
he	13
could	13
get	13
over	13
by	13
arranging	13
with	13
a	13
Tagarin	13
Moor	13
to	13
go	13
shares	13
with	13
him	13
in	13
the	13
purchase	13
of	13
the	13
vessel,	13
and	13
in	13
the	13
profit	13
on	13
the	13
cargo;	13
and	13
under	13
cover	13
of	13
this	13
he	13
could	13
become	13
master	13
of	13
the	13
vessel,	13
in	13
which	13
case	13
he	13
looked	13
upon	13
all	13
the	13
rest	13
as	13
accomplished.	13
But	13
though	13
to	13
me	13
and	13
my	13
comrades	13
it	13
had	13
seemed	13
a	13
better	13
plan	13
to	13
send	13
to	13
Majorca	13
for	13
the	13
vessel,	13
as	13
the	13
Moorish	13
lady	13
suggested,	13
we	13
did	13
not	13
dare	13
to	13
oppose	13
him,	13
fearing	13
that	13
if	13
we	13
did	13
not	13
do	13
as	13
he	13
said	13
he	13
would	13
denounce	13
us,	13
and	13
place	13
us	13
in	13
danger	13
of	13
losing	13
all	13
our	13
lives	13
if	13
he	13
were	13
to	13
disclose	13
our	13
dealings	13
with	13
Zoraida,	13
for	13
whose	13
life	13
we	13
would	13
have	13
all	13
given	13
our	13
own.	13
We	13
therefore	13
resolved	13
to	13
put	13
ourselves	13
in	13
the	13
hands	13
of	13
God	13
and	13
in	13
the	13
renegade’s;	13
and	13
at	13
the	13
same	13
time	13
an	13
answer	13
was	13
given	13
to	13
Zoraida,	13
telling	13
her	13
that	13
we	13
would	13
do	13
all	13
she	13
recommended,	13
for	13
she	13
had	13
given	13
as	13
good	13
advice	13
as	13
if	13
Lela	13
Marien	13
had	13
delivered	13
it,	13
and	13
that	13
it	13
depended	13
on	13
her	13
alone	13
whether	13
we	13
were	13
to	13
defer	13
the	13
business	13
or	13
put	13
it	13
in	13
execution	13
at	13
once.	13
I	13
renewed	13
my	13
promise	13
to	13
be	13
her	13
husband;	13
and	13
thus	13
the	13
next	13
day	13
that	13
the	13
baño	13
chanced	13
to	13
be	13
empty	13
she	13
at	13
different	13
times	13
gave	13
us	13
by	13
means	13
of	13
the	13
reed	13
and	13
cloth	13
two	13
thousand	13
gold	13
crowns	13
and	13
a	13
paper	13
in	13
which	13
she	13
said	13
that	13
the	13
next	13
Juma,	13
that	13
is	13
to	13
say	13
Friday,	13
she	13
was	13
going	13
to	13
her	13
father’s	13
garden,	13
but	13
that	13
before	13
she	13
went	13
she	13
would	13
give	13
us	13
more	13
money;	13
and	13
if	13
it	13
were	13
not	13
enough	13
we	13
were	13
to	13
let	13
her	13
know,	13
as	13
she	13
would	13
give	13
us	13
as	13
much	13
as	13
we	13
asked,	13
for	13
her	13
father	13
had	13
so	13
much	13
he	13
would	13
not	13
miss	13
it,	13
and	13
besides	13
she	13
kept	13
all	13
the	13
keys.	13
We	13
at	13
once	13
gave	13
the	13
renegade	13
five	13
hundred	13
crowns	13
to	13
buy	13
the	13
vessel,	13
and	13
with	13
eight	13
hundred	13
I	13
ransomed	13
myself,	13
giving	13
the	13
money	13
to	13
a	13
Valencian	13
merchant	13
who	13
happened	13
to	13
be	13
in	13
Algiers	13
at	13
the	13
time,	13
and	13
who	13
had	13
me	13
released	13
on	13
his	13
word,	13
pledging	13
it	13
that	13
on	13
the	13
arrival	13
of	13
the	13
first	13
ship	13
from	13
Valencia	13
he	13
would	13
pay	13
my	13
ransom;	13
for	13
if	13
he	13
had	13
given	13
the	13
money	13
at	13
once	13
it	13
would	13
have	13
made	13
the	13
king	13
suspect	13
that	13
my	13
ransom	13
money	13
had	13
been	13
for	13
a	13
long	13
time	13
in	13
Algiers,	13
and	13
that	13
the	13
merchant	13
had	13
for	13
his	13
own	13
advantage	13
kept	13
it	13
secret.	13
In	13
fact	13
my	13
master	13
was	13
so	13
difficult	13
to	13
deal	13
with	13
that	13
I	13
dared	13
not	13
on	13
any	13
account	13
pay	13
down	13
the	13
money	13
at	13
once.	13
The	13
Thursday	13
before	13
the	13
Friday	13
on	13
which	13
the	13
fair	13
Zoraida	13
was	13
to	13
go	13
to	13
the	13
garden	13
she	13
gave	13
us	13
a	13
thousand	13
crowns	13
more,	13
and	13
warned	13
us	13
of	13
her	13
departure,	13
begging	13
me,	13
if	13
I	13
were	13
ransomed,	13
to	13
find	13
out	13
her	13
father’s	13
garden	13
at	13
once,	13
and	13
by	13
all	13
means	13
to	13
seek	13
an	13
opportunity	13
of	13
going	13
there	13
to	13
see	13
her.	13
I	13
answered	13
in	13
a	13
few	13
words	13
that	13
I	13
would	13
do	13
so,	13
and	13
that	13
she	13
must	13
remember	13
to	13
commend	13
us	13
to	13
Lela	13
Marien	13
with	13
all	13
the	13
prayers	13
the	13
captive	13
had	13
taught	13
her.	13
This	13
having	13
been	13
done,	13
steps	13
were	13
taken	13
to	13
ransom	13
our	13
three	13
comrades,	13
so	13
as	13
to	13
enable	13
them	13
to	13
quit	13
the	13
baño,	13
and	13
lest,	13
seeing	13
me	13
ransomed	13
and	13
themselves	13
not,	13
though	13
the	13
money	13
was	13
forthcoming,	13
they	13
should	13
make	13
a	13
disturbance	13
about	13
it	13
and	13
the	13
devil	13
should	13
prompt	13
them	13
to	13
do	13
something	13
that	13
might	13
injure	13
Zoraida;	13
for	13
though	13
their	13
position	13
might	13
be	13
sufficient	13
to	13
relieve	13
me	13
from	13
this	13
apprehension,	13
nevertheless	13
I	13
was	13
unwilling	13
to	13
run	13
any	13
risk	13
in	13
the	13
matter;	13
and	13
so	13
I	13
had	13
them	13
ransomed	13
in	13
the	13
same	13
way	13
as	13
I	13
was,	13
handing	13
over	13
all	13
the	13
money	13
to	13
the	13
merchant	13
so	13
that	13
he	13
might	13
with	13
safety	13
and	13
confidence	13
give	13
security;	13
without,	13
however,	13
confiding	13
our	13
arrangement	13
and	13
secret	13
to	13
him,	13
which	13
might	13
have	13
been	13
dangerous.	13

IN	13

THE	13
CAPTIVE	13
STILL	13
CONTINUES	13
HIS	13
ADVENTURES	13
c41a.jpg	13
(106K)	13
Full	13
Size	13
Before	13
fifteen	13
days	13
were	13
over	13
our	13
renegade	13
had	13
already	13
purchased	13
an	13
excellent	13
vessel	13
with	13
room	13
for	13
more	13
than	13
thirty	13
persons;	13
and	13
to	13
make	13
the	13
transaction	13
safe	13
and	13
lend	13
a	13
colour	13
to	13
it,	13
he	13
thought	13
it	13
well	13
to	13
make,	13
as	13
he	13
did,	13
a	13
voyage	13
to	13
a	13
place	13
called	13
Shershel,	13
twenty	13
leagues	13
from	13
Algiers	13
on	13
the	13
Oran	13
side,	13
where	13
there	13
is	13
an	13
extensive	13
trade	13
in	13
dried	13
figs.	13
Two	13
or	13
three	13
times	13
he	13
made	13
this	13
voyage	13
in	13
company	13
with	13
the	13
Tagarin	13
already	13
mentioned.	13
The	13
Moors	13
of	13
Aragon	13
are	13
called	13
Tagarins	13
in	13
Barbary,	13
and	13
those	13
of	13
Granada	13
Mudéjares;	13
but	13
in	13
the	13
Kingdom	13
of	13
Fez	13
they	13
call	13
the	13
Mudéjares	13
Elches,	13
and	13
they	13
are	13
the	13
people	13
the	13
king	13
chiefly	13
employs	13
in	13
war.	13
To	13
proceed:	13
every	13
time	13
he	13
passed	13
with	13
his	13
vessel	13
he	13
anchored	13
in	13
a	13
cove	13
that	13
was	13
not	13
two	13
crossbow	13
shots	13
from	13
the	13
garden	13
where	13
Zoraida	13
was	13
waiting;	13
and	13
there	13
the	13
renegade,	13
together	13
with	13
the	13
two	13
Moorish	13
lads	13
that	13
rowed,	13
used	13
purposely	13
to	13
station	13
himself,	13
either	13
going	13
through	13
his	13
prayers,	13
or	13
else	13
practising	13
as	13
a	13
part	13
what	13
he	13
meant	13
to	13
perform	13
in	13
earnest.	13
And	13
thus	13
he	13
would	13
go	13
to	13
Zoraida’s	13
garden	13
and	13
ask	13
for	13
fruit,	13
which	13
her	13
father	13
gave	13
him,	13
not	13
knowing	13
him;	13
but	13
though,	13
as	13
he	13
afterwards	13
told	13
me,	13
he	13
sought	13
to	13
speak	13
to	13
Zoraida,	13
and	13
tell	13
her	13
who	13
he	13
was,	13
and	13
that	13
by	13
my	13
orders	13
he	13
was	13
to	13
take	13
her	13
to	13
the	13
land	13
of	13
the	13
Christians,	13
so	13
that	13
she	13
might	13
feel	13
satisfied	13
and	13
easy,	13
he	13
had	13
never	13
been	13
able	13
to	13
do	13
so;	13
for	13
the	13
Moorish	13
women	13
do	13
not	13
allow	13
themselves	13
to	13
be	13
seen	13
by	13
any	13
Moor	13
or	13
Turk,	13
unless	13
their	13
husband	13
or	13
father	13
bid	13
them:	13
with	13
Christian	13
captives	13
they	13
permit	13
freedom	13
of	13
intercourse	13
and	13
communication,	13
even	13
more	13
than	13
might	13
be	13
considered	13
proper.	13
But	13
for	13
my	13
part	13
I	13
should	13
have	13
been	13
sorry	13
if	13
he	13
had	13
spoken	13
to	13
her,	13
for	13
perhaps	13
it	13
might	13
have	13
alarmed	13
her	13
to	13
find	13
her	13
affairs	13
talked	13
of	13
by	13
renegades.	13
But	13
God,	13
who	13
ordered	13
it	13
otherwise,	13
afforded	13
no	13
opportunity	13
for	13
our	13
renegade’s	13
well-meant	13
purpose;	13
and	13
he,	13
seeing	13
how	13
safely	13
he	13
could	13
go	13
to	13
Shershel	13
and	13
return,	13
and	13
anchor	13
when	13
and	13
how	13
and	13
where	13
he	13
liked,	13
and	13
that	13
the	13
Tagarin	13
his	13
partner	13
had	13
no	13
will	13
but	13
his,	13
and	13
that,	13
now	13
I	13
was	13
ransomed,	13
all	13
we	13
wanted	13
was	13
to	13
find	13
some	13
Christians	13
to	13
row,	13
told	13
me	13
to	13
look	13
out	13
for	13
any	13
I	13
should	13
be	13
willing	13
to	13
take	13
with	13
me,	13
over	13
and	13
above	13
those	13
who	13
had	13
been	13
ransomed,	13
and	13
to	13
engage	13
them	13
for	13
the	13
next	13
Friday,	13
which	13
he	13
fixed	13
upon	13
for	13
our	13
departure.	13
On	13
this	13
I	13
spoke	13
to	13
twelve	13
Spaniards,	13
all	13
stout	13
rowers,	13
and	13
such	13
as	13
could	13
most	13
easily	13
leave	13
the	13
city;	13
but	13
it	13
was	13
no	13
easy	13
matter	13
to	13
find	13
so	13
many	13
just	13
then,	13
because	13
there	13
were	13
twenty	13
ships	13
out	13
on	13
a	13
cruise	13
and	13
they	13
had	13
taken	13
all	13
the	13
rowers	13
with	13
them;	13
and	13
these	13
would	13
not	13
have	13
been	13
found	13
were	13
it	13
not	13
that	13
their	13
master	13
remained	13
at	13
home	13
that	13
summer	13
without	13
going	13
to	13
sea	13
in	13
order	13
to	13
finish	13
a	13
galliot	13
that	13
he	13
had	13
upon	13
the	13
stocks.	13
To	13
these	13
men	13
I	13
said	13
nothing	13
more	13
than	13
that	13
the	13
next	13
Friday	13
in	13
the	13
evening	13
they	13
were	13
to	13
come	13
out	13
stealthily	13
one	13
by	13
one	13
and	13
hang	13
about	13
Hadji	13
Morato’s	13
garden,	13
waiting	13
for	13
me	13
there	13
until	13
I	13
came.	13
These	13
directions	13
I	13
gave	13
each	13
one	13
separately,	13
with	13
orders	13
that	13
if	13
they	13
saw	13
any	13
other	13
Christians	13
there	13
they	13
were	13
not	13
to	13
say	13
anything	13
to	13
them	13
except	13
that	13
I	13
had	13
directed	13
them	13
to	13
wait	13
at	13
that	13
spot.	13
This	13
preliminary	13
having	13
been	13
settled,	13
another	13
still	13
more	13
necessary	13
step	13
had	13
to	13
be	13
taken,	13
which	13
was	13
to	13
let	13
Zoraida	13
know	13
how	13
matters	13
stood	13
that	13
she	13
might	13
be	13
prepared	13
and	13
forewarned,	13
so	13
as	13
not	13
to	13
be	13
taken	13
by	13
surprise	13
if	13
we	13
were	13
suddenly	13
to	13
seize	13
upon	13
her	13
before	13
she	13
thought	13
the	13
Christians’	13
vessel	13
could	13
have	13
returned.	13
I	13
determined,	13
therefore,	13
to	13
go	13
to	13
the	13
garden	13
and	13
try	13
if	13
I	13
could	13
speak	13
to	13
her;	13
and	13
the	13
day	13
before	13
my	13
departure	13
I	13
went	13
there	13
under	13
the	13
pretence	13
of	13
gathering	13
herbs.	13
The	13
first	13
person	13
I	13
met	13
was	13
her	13
father,	13
who	13
addressed	13
me	13
in	13
the	13
language	13
that	13
all	13
over	13
Barbary	13
and	13
even	13
in	13
Constantinople	13
is	13
the	13
medium	13
between	13
captives	13
and	13
Moors,	13
and	13
is	13
neither	13
Morisco	13
nor	13
Castilian,	13
nor	13
of	13
any	13
other	13
nation,	13
but	13
a	13
mixture	13
of	13
all	13
languages,	13
by	13
means	13
of	13
which	13
we	13
can	13
all	13
understand	13
one	13
another.	13
In	13
this	13
sort	13
of	13
language,	13
I	13
say,	13
he	13
asked	13
me	13
what	13
I	13
wanted	13
in	13
his	13
garden,	13
and	13
to	13
whom	13
I	13
belonged.	13
I	13
replied	13
that	13
I	13
was	13
a	13
slave	13
of	13
the	13
Arnaut	13
Mami	13
(for	13
I	13
knew	13
as	13
a	13
certainty	13
that	13
he	13
was	13
a	13
very	13
great	13
friend	13
of	13
his),	13
and	13
that	13
I	13
wanted	13
some	13
herbs	13
to	13
make	13
a	13
salad.	13
He	13
asked	13
me	13
then	13
whether	13
I	13
were	13
on	13
ransom	13
or	13
not,	13
and	13
what	13
my	13
master	13
demanded	13
for	13
me.	13
While	13
these	13
questions	13
and	13
answers	13
were	13
proceeding,	13
the	13
fair	13
Zoraida,	13
who	13
had	13
already	13
perceived	13
me	13
some	13
time	13
before,	13
came	13
out	13
of	13
the	13
house	13
in	13
the	13
garden,	13
and	13
as	13
Moorish	13
women	13
are	13
by	13
no	13
means	13
particular	13
about	13
letting	13
themselves	13
be	13
seen	13
by	13
Christians,	13
or,	13
as	13
I	13
have	13
said	13
before,	13
at	13
all	13
coy,	13
she	13
had	13
no	13
hesitation	13
in	13
coming	13
to	13
where	13
her	13
father	13
stood	13
with	13
me;	13
moreover	13
her	13
father,	13
seeing	13
her	13
approaching	13
slowly,	13
called	13
to	13
her	13
to	13
come.	13
It	13
would	13
be	13
beyond	13
my	13
power	13
now	13
to	13
describe	13
to	13
you	13
the	13
great	13
beauty,	13
the	13
high-bred	13
air,	13
the	13
brilliant	13
attire	13
of	13
my	13
beloved	13
Zoraida	13
as	13
she	13
presented	13
herself	13
before	13
my	13
eyes.	13
I	13
will	13
content	13
myself	13
with	13
saying	13
that	13
more	13
pearls	13
hung	13
from	13
her	13
fair	13
neck,	13
her	13
ears,	13
and	13
her	13
hair	13
than	13
she	13
had	13
hairs	13
on	13
her	13
head.	13
On	13
her	13
ankles,	13
which	13
as	13
is	13
customary	13
were	13
bare,	13
she	13
had	13
carcajes	13
(for	13
so	13
bracelets	13
or	13
anklets	13
are	13
called	13
in	13
Morisco)	13
of	13
the	13
purest	13
gold,	13
set	13
with	13
so	13
many	13
diamonds	13
that	13
she	13
told	13
me	13
afterwards	13
her	13
father	13
valued	13
them	13
at	13
ten	13
thousand	13
doubloons,	13
and	13
those	13
she	13
had	13
on	13
her	13
wrists	13
were	13
worth	13
as	13
much	13
more.	13
The	13
pearls	13
were	13
in	13
profusion	13
and	13
very	13
fine,	13
for	13
the	13
highest	13
display	13
and	13
adornment	13
of	13
the	13
Moorish	13
women	13
is	13
decking	13
themselves	13
with	13
rich	13
pearls	13
and	13
seed-pearls;	13
and	13
of	13
these	13
there	13
are	13
therefore	13
more	13
among	13
the	13
Moors	13
than	13
among	13
any	13
other	13
people.	13
Zoraida’s	13
father	13
had	13
to	13
the	13
reputation	13
of	13
possessing	13
a	13
great	13
number,	13
and	13
the	13
purest	13
in	13
all	13
Algiers,	13
and	13
of	13
possessing	13
also	13
more	13
than	13
two	13
hundred	13
thousand	13
Spanish	13
crowns;	13
and	13
she,	13
who	13
is	13
now	13
mistress	13
of	13
me	13
only,	13
was	13
mistress	13
of	13
all	13
this.	13
Whether	13
thus	13
adorned	13
she	13
would	13
have	13
been	13
beautiful	13
or	13
not,	13
and	13
what	13
she	13
must	13
have	13
been	13
in	13
her	13
prosperity,	13
may	13
be	13
imagined	13
from	13
the	13
beauty	13
remaining	13
to	13
her	13
after	13
so	13
many	13
hardships;	13
for,	13
as	13
everyone	13
knows,	13
the	13
beauty	13
of	13
some	13
women	13
has	13
its	13
times	13
and	13
its	13
seasons,	13
and	13
is	13
increased	13
or	13
diminished	13
by	13
chance	13
causes;	13
and	13
naturally	13
the	13
emotions	13
of	13
the	13
mind	13
will	13
heighten	13
or	13
impair	13
it,	13
though	13
indeed	13
more	13
frequently	13
they	13
totally	13
destroy	13
it.	13
In	13
a	13
word	13
she	13
presented	13
herself	13
before	13
me	13
that	13
day	13
attired	13
with	13
the	13
utmost	13
splendour,	13
and	13
supremely	13
beautiful;	13
at	13
any	13
rate,	13
she	13
seemed	13
to	13
me	13
the	13
most	13
beautiful	13
object	13
I	13
had	13
ever	13
seen;	13
and	13
when,	13
besides,	13
I	13
thought	13
of	13
all	13
I	13
owed	13
to	13
her	13
I	13
felt	13
as	13
though	13
I	13
had	13
before	13
me	13
some	13
heavenly	13
being	13
come	13
to	13
earth	13
to	13
bring	13
me	13
relief	13
and	13
happiness.	13
As	13
she	13
approached	13
her	13
father	13
told	13
her	13
in	13
his	13
own	13
language	13
that	13
I	13
was	13
a	13
captive	13
belonging	13
to	13
his	13
friend	13
the	13
Arnaut	13
Mami,	13
and	13
that	13
I	13
had	13
come	13
for	13
salad.	13
She	13
took	13
up	13
the	13
conversation,	13
and	13
in	13
that	13
mixture	13
of	13
tongues	13
I	13
have	13
spoken	13
of	13
she	13
asked	13
me	13
if	13
I	13
was	13
a	13
gentleman,	13
and	13
why	13
I	13
was	13
not	13
ransomed.	13
I	13
answered	13
that	13
I	13
was	13
already	13
ransomed,	13
and	13
that	13
by	13
the	13
price	13
it	13
might	13
be	13
seen	13
what	13
value	13
my	13
master	13
set	13
on	13
me,	13
as	13
they	13
had	13
given	13
one	13
thousand	13
five	13
hundred	13
zoltanis	13
for	13
me;	13
to	13
which	13
she	13
replied,	13
“Hadst	13
thou	13
been	13
my	13
father’s,	13
I	13
can	13
tell	13
thee,	13
I	13
would	13
not	13
have	13
let	13
him	13
part	13
with	13
thee	13
for	13
twice	13
as	13
much,	13
for	13
you	13
Christians	13
always	13
tell	13
lies	13
about	13
yourselves	13
and	13
make	13
yourselves	13
out	13
poor	13
to	13
cheat	13
the	13
Moors.”	13
“That	13
may	13
be,	13
lady,”	13
said	13
I;	13
“but	13
indeed	13
I	13
dealt	13
truthfully	13
with	13
my	13
master,	13
as	13
I	13
do	13
and	13
mean	13
to	13
do	13
with	13
everybody	13
in	13
the	13
world.”	13
“And	13
when	13
dost	13
thou	13
go?”	13
said	13
Zoraida.	13
“To-morrow,	13
I	13
think,”	13
said	13
I,	13
“for	13
there	13
is	13
a	13
vessel	13
here	13
from	13
France	13
which	13
sails	13
to-morrow,	13
and	13
I	13
think	13
I	13
shall	13
go	13
in	13
her.”	13
“Would	13
it	13
not	13
be	13
better,”	13
said	13
Zoraida,	13
“to	13
wait	13
for	13
the	13
arrival	13
of	13
ships	13
from	13
Spain	13
and	13
go	13
with	13
them	13
and	13
not	13
with	13
the	13
French	13
who	13
are	13
not	13
your	13
friends?”	13
“No,”	13
said	13
I;	13
“though	13
if	13
there	13
were	13
intelligence	13
that	13
a	13
vessel	13
were	13
now	13
coming	13
from	13
Spain	13
it	13
is	13
true	13
I	13
might,	13
perhaps,	13
wait	13
for	13
it;	13
however,	13
it	13
is	13
more	13
likely	13
I	13
shall	13
depart	13
to-morrow,	13
for	13
the	13
longing	13
I	13
feel	13
to	13
return	13
to	13
my	13
country	13
and	13
to	13
those	13
I	13
love	13
is	13
so	13
great	13
that	13
it	13
will	13
not	13
allow	13
me	13
to	13
wait	13
for	13
another	13
opportunity,	13
however	13
more	13
convenient,	13
if	13
it	13
be	13
delayed.”	13
“No	13
doubt	13
thou	13
art	13
married	13
in	13
thine	13
own	13
country,”	13
said	13
Zoraida,	13
“and	13
for	13
that	13
reason	13
thou	13
art	13
anxious	13
to	13
go	13
and	13
see	13
thy	13
wife.”	13
“I	13
am	13
not	13
married,”	13
I	13
replied,	13
“but	13
I	13
have	13
given	13
my	13
promise	13
to	13
marry	13
on	13
my	13
arrival	13
there.”	13
“And	13
is	13
the	13
lady	13
beautiful	13
to	13
whom	13
thou	13
hast	13
given	13
it?”	13
said	13
Zoraida.	13
“So	13
beautiful,”	13
said	13
I,	13
“that,	13
to	13
describe	13
her	13
worthily	13
and	13
tell	13
thee	13
the	13
truth,	13
she	13
is	13
very	13
like	13
thee.”	13
At	13
this	13
her	13
father	13
laughed	13
very	13
heartily	13
and	13
said,	13
“By	13
Allah,	13
Christian,	13
she	13
must	13
be	13
very	13
beautiful	13
if	13
she	13
is	13
like	13
my	13
daughter,	13
who	13
is	13
the	13
most	13
beautiful	13
woman	13
in	13
all	13
this	13
kingdom:	13
only	13
look	13
at	13
her	13
well	13
and	13
thou	13
wilt	13
see	13
I	13
am	13
telling	13
the	13
truth.”	13
Zoraida’s	13
father	13
as	13
the	13
better	13
linguist	13
helped	13
to	13
interpret	13
most	13
of	13
these	13
words	13
and	13
phrases,	13
for	13
though	13
she	13
spoke	13
the	13
bastard	13
language,	13
that,	13
as	13
I	13
have	13
said,	13
is	13
employed	13
there,	13
she	13
expressed	13
her	13
meaning	13
more	13
by	13
signs	13
than	13
by	13
words.	13
While	13
we	13
were	13
still	13
engaged	13
in	13
this	13
conversation,	13
a	13
Moor	13
came	13
running	13
up,	13
exclaiming	13
that	13
four	13
Turks	13
had	13
leaped	13
over	13
the	13
fence	13
or	13
wall	13
of	13
the	13
garden,	13
and	13
were	13
gathering	13
the	13
fruit	13
though	13
it	13
was	13
not	13
yet	13
ripe.	13
The	13
old	13
man	13
was	13
alarmed	13
and	13
Zoraida	13
too,	13
for	13
the	13
Moors	13
commonly,	13
and,	13
so	13
to	13
speak,	13
instinctively	13
have	13
a	13
dread	13
of	13
the	13
Turks,	13
but	13
particularly	13
of	13
the	13
soldiers,	13
who	13
are	13
so	13
insolent	13
and	13
domineering	13
to	13
the	13
Moors	13
who	13
are	13
under	13
their	13
power	13
that	13
they	13
treat	13
them	13
worse	13
than	13
if	13
they	13
were	13
their	13
slaves.	13
Her	13
father	13
said	13
to	13
Zoraida,	13
“Daughter,	13
retire	13
into	13
the	13
house	13
and	13
shut	13
thyself	13
in	13
while	13
I	13
go	13
and	13
speak	13
to	13
these	13
dogs;	13
and	13
thou,	13
Christian,	13
pick	13
thy	13
herbs,	13
and	13
go	13
in	13
peace,	13
and	13
Allah	13
bring	13
thee	13
safe	13
to	13
thy	13
own	13
country.”	13
I	13
bowed,	13
and	13
he	13
went	13
away	13
to	13
look	13
for	13
the	13
Turks,	13
leaving	13
me	13
alone	13
with	13
Zoraida,	13
who	13
made	13
as	13
if	13
she	13
were	13
about	13
to	13
retire	13
as	13
her	13
father	13
bade	13
her;	13
but	13
the	13
moment	13
he	13
was	13
concealed	13
by	13
the	13
trees	13
of	13
the	13
garden,	13
turning	13
to	13
me	13
with	13
her	13
eyes	13
full	13
of	13
tears	13
she	13
said,	13
“Tameji,	13
cristiano,	13
tameji?”	13
that	13
is	13
to	13
say,	13
“Art	13
thou	13
going,	13
Christian,	13
art	13
thou	13
going?”	13
I	13
made	13
answer,	13
“Yes,	13
lady,	13
but	13
not	13
without	13
thee,	13
come	13
what	13
may:	13
be	13
on	13
the	13
watch	13
for	13
me	13
on	13
the	13
next	13
Juma,	13
and	13
be	13
not	13
alarmed	13
when	13
thou	13
seest	13
us;	13
for	13
most	13
surely	13
we	13
shall	13
go	13
to	13
the	13
land	13
of	13
the	13
Christians.”	13
This	13
I	13
said	13
in	13
such	13
a	13
way	13
that	13
she	13
understood	13
perfectly	13
all	13
that	13
passed	13
between	13
us,	13
and	13
throwing	13
her	13
arm	13
round	13
my	13
neck	13
she	13
began	13
with	13
feeble	13
steps	13
to	13
move	13
towards	13
the	13
house;	13
but	13
as	13
fate	13
would	13
have	13
it	13
(and	13
it	13
might	13
have	13
been	13
very	13
unfortunate	13
if	13
Heaven	13
had	13
not	13
otherwise	13
ordered	13
it),	13
just	13
as	13
we	13
were	13
moving	13
on	13
in	13
the	13
manner	13
and	13
position	13
I	13
have	13
described,	13
with	13
her	13
arm	13
round	13
my	13
neck,	13
her	13
father,	13
as	13
he	13
returned	13
after	13
having	13
sent	13
away	13
the	13
Turks,	13
saw	13
how	13
we	13
were	13
walking	13
and	13
we	13
perceived	13
that	13
he	13
saw	13
us;	13
but	13
Zoraida,	13
ready	13
and	13
quickwitted,	13
took	13
care	13
not	13
to	13
remove	13
her	13
arm	13
from	13
my	13
neck,	13
but	13
on	13
the	13
contrary	13
drew	13
closer	13
to	13
me	13
and	13
laid	13
her	13
head	13
on	13
my	13
breast,	13
bending	13
her	13
knees	13
a	13
little	13
and	13
showing	13
all	13
the	13
signs	13
and	13
tokens	13
of	13
fainting,	13
while	13
I	13
at	13
the	13
same	13
time	13
made	13
it	13
seem	13
as	13
though	13
I	13
were	13
supporting	13
her	13
against	13
my	13
will.	13
Her	13
father	13
came	13
running	13
up	13
to	13
where	13
we	13
were,	13
and	13
seeing	13
his	13
daughter	13
in	13
this	13
state	13
asked	13
what	13
was	13
the	13
matter	13
with	13
her;	13
she,	13
however,	13
giving	13
no	13
answer,	13
he	13
said,	13
“No	13
doubt	13
she	13
has	13
fainted	13
in	13
alarm	13
at	13
the	13
entrance	13
of	13
those	13
dogs,”	13
and	13
taking	13
her	13
from	13
mine	13
he	13
drew	13
her	13
to	13
his	13
own	13
breast,	13
while	13
she	13
sighing,	13
her	13
eyes	13
still	13
wet	13
with	13
tears,	13
said	13
again,	13
“Ameji,	13
cristiano,	13
ameji”—“Go,	13
Christian,	13
go.”	13
To	13
this	13
her	13
father	13
replied,	13
“There	13
is	13
no	13
need,	13
daughter,	13
for	13
the	13
Christian	13
to	13
go,	13
for	13
he	13
has	13
done	13
thee	13
no	13
harm,	13
and	13
the	13
Turks	13
have	13
now	13
gone;	13
feel	13
no	13
alarm,	13
there	13
is	13
nothing	13
to	13
hurt	13
thee,	13
for	13
as	13
I	13
say,	13
the	13
Turks	13
at	13
my	13
request	13
have	13
gone	13
back	13
the	13
way	13
they	13
came.”	13

“It	13
was	13
they	13
who	13
terrified	13
her,	13
as	13
thou	13
hast	13
said,	13
señor,”	13
said	13
I	13
to	13
her	13
father;	13
“but	13
since	13
she	13
tells	13
me	13
to	13
go,	13
I	13
have	13
no	13
wish	13
to	13
displease	13
her:	13
peace	13
be	13
with	13
thee,	13
and	13
with	13
thy	13
leave	13
I	13
will	13
come	13
back	13
to	13
this	13
garden	13
for	13
herbs	13
if	13
need	13
be,	13
for	13
my	13
master	13
says	13
there	13
are	13
nowhere	13
better	13
herbs	13
for	13
salad	13
than	13
here.”	13
“Come	13
back	13
for	13
any	13
thou	13
hast	13
need	13
of,”	13
replied	13
Hadji	13
Morato;	13
“for	13
my	13
daughter	13
does	13
not	13
speak	13
thus	13
because	13
she	13
is	13
displeased	13
with	13
thee	13
or	13
any	13
Christian:	13
she	13
only	13
meant	13
that	13
the	13
Turks	13
should	13
go,	13
not	13
thou;	13
or	13
that	13
it	13
was	13
time	13
for	13
thee	13
to	13
look	13
for	13
thy	13
herbs.”	13
With	13
this	13
I	13
at	13
once	13
took	13
my	13
leave	13
of	13
both;	13
and	13
she,	13
looking	13
as	13
though	13
her	13
heart	13
were	13
breaking,	13
retired	13
with	13
her	13
father.	13
While	13
pretending	13
to	13
look	13
for	13
herbs	13
I	13
made	13
the	13
round	13
of	13
the	13
garden	13
at	13
my	13
ease,	13
and	13
studied	13
carefully	13
all	13
the	13
approaches	13
and	13
outlets,	13
and	13
the	13
fastenings	13
of	13
the	13
house	13
and	13
everything	13
that	13
could	13
be	13
taken	13
advantage	13
of	13
to	13
make	13
our	13
task	13
easy.	13

Having	13
done	13
so	13
I	13
went	13
and	13
gave	13
an	13
account	13
of	13
all	13
that	13
had	13
taken	13
place	13
to	13
the	13
renegade	13
and	13
my	13
comrades,	13
and	13
looked	13
forward	13
with	13
impatience	13
to	13
the	13
hour	13
when,	13
all	13
fear	13
at	13
an	13
end,	13
I	13
should	13
find	13
myself	13
in	13
possession	13
of	13
the	13
prize	13
which	13
fortune	13
held	13
out	13
to	13
me	13
in	13
the	13
fair	13
and	13
lovely	13
Zoraida.	13
The	13
time	13
passed	13
at	13
length,	13
and	13
the	13
appointed	13
day	13
we	13
so	13
longed	13
for	13
arrived;	13
and,	13
all	13
following	13
out	13
the	13
arrangement	13
and	13
plan	13
which,	13
after	13
careful	13
consideration	13
and	13
many	13
a	13
long	13
discussion,	13
we	13
had	13
decided	13
upon,	13
we	13
succeeded	13
as	13
fully	13
as	13
we	13
could	13
have	13
wished;	13
for	13
on	13
the	13
Friday	13
following	13
the	13
day	13
upon	13
which	13
I	13
spoke	13
to	13
Zoraida	13
in	13
the	13
garden,	13
the	13
renegade	13
anchored	13
his	13
vessel	13
at	13
nightfall	13
almost	13
opposite	13
the	13
spot	13
where	13
she	13
was.	13
The	13
Christians	13
who	13
were	13
to	13
row	13
were	13
ready	13
and	13
in	13
hiding	13
in	13
different	13
places	13
round	13
about,	13
all	13
waiting	13
for	13
me,	13
anxious	13
and	13
elated,	13
and	13
eager	13
to	13
attack	13
the	13
vessel	13
they	13
had	13
before	13
their	13
eyes;	13
for	13
they	13
did	13
not	13
know	13
the	13
renegade’s	13
plan,	13
but	13
expected	13
that	13
they	13
were	13
to	13
gain	13
their	13
liberty	13
by	13
force	13
of	13
arms	13
and	13
by	13
killing	13
the	13
Moors	13
who	13
were	13
on	13
board	13
the	13
vessel.	13
As	13
soon,	13
then,	13
as	13
I	13
and	13
my	13
comrades	13
made	13
our	13
appearance,	13
all	13
those	13
that	13
were	13
in	13
hiding	13
seeing	13
us	13
came	13
and	13
joined	13
us.	13
It	13
was	13
now	13
the	13
time	13
when	13
the	13
city	13
gates	13
are	13
shut,	13
and	13
there	13
was	13
no	13
one	13
to	13
be	13
seen	13
in	13
all	13
the	13
space	13
outside.	13
When	13
we	13
were	13
collected	13
together	13
we	13
debated	13
whether	13
it	13
would	13
be	13
better	13
first	13
to	13
go	13
for	13
Zoraida,	13
or	13
to	13
make	13
prisoners	13
of	13
the	13
Moorish	13
rowers	13
who	13
rowed	13
in	13
the	13
vessel;	13
but	13
while	13
we	13
were	13
still	13
uncertain	13
our	13
renegade	13
came	13
up	13
asking	13
us	13
what	13
kept	13
us,	13
as	13
it	13
was	13
now	13
the	13
time,	13
and	13
all	13
the	13
Moors	13
were	13
off	13
their	13
guard	13
and	13
most	13
of	13
them	13
asleep.	13
We	13
told	13
him	13
why	13
we	13
hesitated,	13
but	13
he	13
said	13
it	13
was	13
of	13
more	13
importance	13
first	13
to	13
secure	13
the	13
vessel,	13
which	13
could	13
be	13
done	13
with	13
the	13
greatest	13
ease	13
and	13
without	13
any	13
danger,	13
and	13
then	13
we	13
could	13
go	13
for	13
Zoraida.	13
We	13
all	13
approved	13
of	13
what	13
he	13
said,	13
and	13
so	13
without	13
further	13
delay,	13
guided	13
by	13
him	13
we	13
made	13
for	13
the	13
vessel,	13
and	13
he	13
leaping	13
on	13
board	13
first,	13
drew	13
his	13
cutlass	13
and	13
said	13
in	13
Morisco,	13
“Let	13
no	13
one	13
stir	13
from	13
this	13
if	13
he	13
does	13
not	13
want	13
it	13
to	13
cost	13
him	13
his	13
life.”	13
By	13
this	13
almost	13
all	13
the	13
Christians	13
were	13
on	13
board,	13
and	13
the	13
Moors,	13
who	13
were	13
fainthearted,	13
hearing	13
their	13
captain	13
speak	13
in	13
this	13
way,	13
were	13
cowed,	13
and	13
without	13
any	13
one	13
of	13
them	13
taking	13
to	13
his	13
arms	13
(and	13
indeed	13
they	13
had	13
few	13
or	13
hardly	13
any)	13
they	13
submitted	13
without	13
saying	13
a	13
word	13
to	13
be	13
bound	13
by	13
the	13
Christians,	13
who	13
quickly	13
secured	13
them,	13
threatening	13
them	13
that	13
if	13
they	13
raised	13
any	13
kind	13
of	13
outcry	13
they	13
would	13
be	13
all	13
put	13
to	13
the	13
sword.	13
This	13
having	13
been	13
accomplished,	13
and	13
half	13
of	13
our	13
party	13
being	13
left	13
to	13
keep	13
guard	13
over	13
them,	13
the	13
rest	13
of	13
us,	13
again	13
taking	13
the	13
renegade	13
as	13
our	13
guide,	13
hastened	13
towards	13
Hadji	13
Morato’s	13
garden,	13
and	13
as	13
good	13
luck	13
would	13
have	13
it,	13
on	13
trying	13
the	13
gate	13
it	13
opened	13
as	13
easily	13
as	13
if	13
it	13
had	13
not	13
been	13
locked;	13
and	13
so,	13
quite	13
quietly	13
and	13
in	13
silence,	13
we	13
reached	13
the	13
house	13
without	13
being	13
perceived	13
by	13
anybody.	13
The	13
lovely	13
Zoraida	13
was	13
watching	13
for	13
us	13
at	13
a	13
window,	13
and	13
as	13
soon	13
as	13
she	13
perceived	13
that	13
there	13
were	13
people	13
there,	13
she	13
asked	13
in	13
a	13
low	13
voice	13
if	13
we	13
were	13
“Nizarani,”	13
as	13
much	13
as	13
to	13
say	13
or	13
ask	13
if	13
we	13
were	13
Christians.	13
I	13
answered	13
that	13
we	13
were,	13
and	13
begged	13
her	13
to	13
come	13
down.	13
As	13
soon	13
as	13
she	13
recognised	13
me	13
she	13
did	13
not	13
delay	13
an	13
instant,	13
but	13
without	13
answering	13
a	13
word	13
came	13
down	13
immediately,	13
opened	13
the	13
door	13
and	13
presented	13
herself	13
before	13
us	13
all,	13
so	13
beautiful	13
and	13
so	13
richly	13
attired	13
that	13
I	13
cannot	13
attempt	13
to	13
describe	13
her.	13
The	13
moment	13
I	13
saw	13
her	13
I	13
took	13
her	13
hand	13
and	13
kissed	13
it,	13
and	13
the	13
renegade	13
and	13
my	13
two	13
comrades	13
did	13
the	13
same;	13
and	13
the	13
rest,	13
who	13
knew	13
nothing	13
of	13
the	13
circumstances,	13
did	13
as	13
they	13
saw	13
us	13
do,	13
for	13
it	13
only	13
seemed	13
as	13
if	13
we	13
were	13
returning	13
thanks	13
to	13
her,	13
and	13
recognising	13
her	13
as	13
the	13
giver	13
of	13
our	13
liberty.	13
The	13
renegade	13
asked	13
her	13
in	13
the	13
Morisco	13
language	13
if	13
her	13
father	13
was	13
in	13
the	13
house.	13
She	13
replied	13
that	13
he	13
was	13
and	13
that	13
he	13
was	13
asleep.	13
“Then	13
it	13
will	13
be	13
necessary	13
to	13
waken	13
him	13
and	13
take	13
him	13
with	13
us,”	13
said	13
the	13
renegade,	13
“and	13
everything	13
of	13
value	13
in	13
this	13
fair	13
mansion.”	13
“Nay,”	13
said	13
she,	13
“my	13
father	13
must	13
not	13
on	13
any	13
account	13
be	13
touched,	13
and	13
there	13
is	13
nothing	13
in	13
the	13
house	13
except	13
what	13
I	13
shall	13
take,	13
and	13
that	13
will	13
be	13
quite	13
enough	13
to	13
enrich	13
and	13
satisfy	13
all	13
of	13
you;	13
wait	13
a	13
little	13
and	13
you	13
shall	13
see,”	13
and	13
so	13
saying	13
she	13
went	13
in,	13
telling	13
us	13
she	13
would	13
return	13
immediately	13
and	13
bidding	13
us	13
keep	13
quiet	13
without	13
making	13
any	13
noise.	13
I	13
asked	13
the	13
renegade	13
what	13
had	13
passed	13
between	13
them,	13
and	13
when	13
he	13
told	13
me,	13
I	13
declared	13
that	13
nothing	13
should	13
be	13
done	13
except	13
in	13
accordance	13
with	13
the	13
wishes	13
of	13
Zoraida,	13
who	13
now	13
came	13
back	13
with	13
a	13
little	13
trunk	13
so	13
full	13
of	13
gold	13
crowns	13
that	13
she	13
could	13
scarcely	13
carry	13
it.	13
Unfortunately	13
her	13
father	13
awoke	13
while	13
this	13
was	13
going	13
on,	13
and	13
hearing	13
a	13
noise	13
in	13
the	13
garden,	13
came	13
to	13
the	13
window,	13
and	13
at	13
once	13
perceiving	13
that	13
all	13
those	13
who	13
were	13
there	13
were	13
Christians,	13
raising	13
a	13
prodigiously	13
loud	13
outcry,	13
he	13
began	13
to	13
call	13
out	13
in	13
Arabic,	13
“Christians,	13
Christians!	13
thieves,	13
thieves!”	13
by	13
which	13
cries	13
we	13
were	13
all	13
thrown	13
into	13
the	13
greatest	13
fear	13
and	13
embarrassment;	13
but	13
the	13
renegade	13
seeing	13
the	13
danger	13
we	13
were	13
in	13
and	13
how	13
important	13
it	13
was	13
for	13
him	13
to	13
effect	13
his	13
purpose	13
before	13
we	13
were	13
heard,	13
mounted	13
with	13
the	13
utmost	13
quickness	13
to	13
where	13
Hadji	13
Morato	13
was,	13
and	13
with	13
him	13
went	13
some	13
of	13
our	13
party;	13
I,	13
however,	13
did	13
not	13
dare	13
to	13
leave	13
Zoraida,	13
who	13
had	13
fallen	13
almost	13
fainting	13
in	13
my	13
arms.	13
To	13
be	13
brief,	13
those	13
who	13
had	13
gone	13
upstairs	13
acted	13
so	13
promptly	13
that	13
in	13
an	13
instant	13
they	13
came	13
down,	13
carrying	13
Hadji	13
Morato	13
with	13
his	13
hands	13
bound	13
and	13
a	13
napkin	13
tied	13
over	13
his	13
mouth,	13
which	13
prevented	13
him	13
from	13
uttering	13
a	13
word,	13
warning	13
him	13
at	13
the	13
same	13
time	13
that	13
to	13
attempt	13
to	13
speak	13
would	13
cost	13
him	13
his	13
life.	13
When	13
his	13
daughter	13
caught	13
sight	13
of	13
him	13
she	13
covered	13
her	13
eyes	13
so	13
as	13
not	13
to	13
see	13
him,	13
and	13
her	13
father	13
was	13
horror-stricken,	13
not	13
knowing	13
how	13
willingly	13
she	13
had	13
placed	13
herself	13
in	13
our	13
hands.	13
But	13
it	13
was	13
now	13
most	13
essential	13
for	13
us	13
to	13
be	13
on	13
the	13
move,	13
and	13
carefully	13
and	13
quickly	13
we	13
regained	13
the	13
vessel,	13
where	13
those	13
who	13
had	13
remained	13
on	13
board	13
were	13
waiting	13
for	13
us	13
in	13
apprehension	13
of	13
some	13
mishap	13
having	13
befallen	13
us.	13
It	13
was	13
barely	13
two	13
hours	13
after	13
night	13
set	13
in	13
when	13
we	13
were	13
all	13
on	13
board	13
the	13
vessel,	13
where	13
the	13
cords	13
were	13
removed	13
from	13
the	13
hands	13
of	13
Zoraida’s	13
father,	13
and	13
the	13
napkin	13
from	13
his	13
mouth;	13
but	13
the	13
renegade	13
once	13
more	13
told	13
him	13
not	13
to	13
utter	13
a	13
word,	13
or	13
they	13
would	13
take	13
his	13
life.	13
He,	13
when	13
he	13
saw	13
his	13
daughter	13
there,	13
began	13
to	13
sigh	13
piteously,	13
and	13
still	13
more	13
when	13
he	13
perceived	13
that	13
I	13
held	13
her	13
closely	13
embraced	13
and	13
that	13
she	13
lay	13
quiet	13
without	13
resisting	13
or	13
complaining,	13
or	13
showing	13
any	13
reluctance;	13
nevertheless	13
he	13
remained	13
silent	13
lest	13
they	13
should	13
carry	13
into	13
effect	13
the	13
repeated	13
threats	13
the	13
renegade	13
had	13
addressed	13
to	13
him.	13
Finding	13
herself	13
now	13
on	13
board,	13
and	13
that	13
we	13
were	13
about	13
to	13
give	13
way	13
with	13
the	13
oars,	13
Zoraida,	13
seeing	13
her	13
father	13
there,	13
and	13
the	13
other	13
Moors	13
bound,	13
bade	13
the	13
renegade	13
ask	13
me	13
to	13
do	13
her	13
the	13
favour	13
of	13
releasing	13
the	13
Moors	13
and	13
setting	13
her	13
father	13
at	13
liberty,	13
for	13
she	13
would	13
rather	13
drown	13
herself	13
in	13
the	13
sea	13
than	13
suffer	13
a	13
father	13
that	13
had	13
loved	13
her	13
so	13
dearly	13
to	13
be	13
carried	13
away	13
captive	13
before	13
her	13
eyes	13
and	13
on	13
her	13
account.	13
The	13
renegade	13
repeated	13
this	13
to	13
me,	13
and	13
I	13
replied	13
that	13
I	13
was	13
very	13
willing	13
to	13
do	13
so;	13
but	13
he	13
replied	13
that	13
it	13
was	13
not	13
advisable,	13
because	13
if	13
they	13
were	13
left	13
there	13
they	13
would	13
at	13
once	13
raise	13
the	13
country	13
and	13
stir	13
up	13
the	13
city,	13
and	13
lead	13
to	13
the	13
despatch	13
of	13
swift	13
cruisers	13
in	13
pursuit,	13
and	13
our	13
being	13
taken,	13
by	13
sea	13
or	13
land,	13
without	13
any	13
possibility	13
of	13
escape;	13
and	13
that	13
all	13
that	13
could	13
be	13
done	13
was	13
to	13
set	13
them	13
free	13
on	13
the	13
first	13
Christian	13
ground	13
we	13
reached.	13
On	13
this	13
point	13
we	13
all	13
agreed;	13
and	13
Zoraida,	13
to	13
whom	13
it	13
was	13
explained,	13
together	13
with	13
the	13
reasons	13
that	13
prevented	13
us	13
from	13
doing	13
at	13
once	13
what	13
she	13
desired,	13
was	13
satisfied	13
likewise;	13
and	13
then	13
in	13
glad	13
silence	13
and	13
with	13
cheerful	13
alacrity	13
each	13
of	13
our	13
stout	13
rowers	13
took	13
his	13
oar,	13
and	13
commending	13
ourselves	13
to	13
God	13
with	13
all	13
our	13
hearts,	13
we	13
began	13
to	13
shape	13
our	13
course	13
for	13
the	13
island	13
of	13
Majorca,	13
the	13
nearest	13
Christian	13
land.	13
Owing,	13
however,	13
to	13
the	13
Tramontana	13
rising	13
a	13
little,	13
and	13
the	13
sea	13
growing	13
somewhat	13
rough,	13
it	13
was	13
impossible	13
for	13
us	13
to	13
keep	13
a	13
straight	13
course	13
for	13
Majorca,	13
and	13
we	13
were	13
compelled	13
to	13
coast	13
in	13
the	13
direction	13
of	13
Oran,	13
not	13
without	13
great	13
uneasiness	13
on	13
our	13
part	13
lest	13
we	13
should	13
be	13
observed	13
from	13
the	13
town	13
of	13
Shershel,	13
which	13
lies	13
on	13
that	13
coast,	13
not	13
more	13
than	13
sixty	13
miles	13
from	13
Algiers.	13
Moreover	13
we	13
were	13
afraid	13
of	13
meeting	13
on	13
that	13
course	13
one	13
of	13
the	13
galliots	13
that	13
usually	13
come	13
with	13
goods	13
from	13
Tetuan;	13
although	13
each	13
of	13
us	13
for	13
himself	13
and	13
all	13
of	13
us	13
together	13
felt	13
confident	13
that,	13
if	13
we	13
were	13
to	13
meet	13
a	13
merchant	13
galliot,	13
so	13
that	13
it	13
were	13
not	13
a	13
cruiser,	13
not	13
only	13
should	13
we	13
not	13
be	13
lost,	13
but	13
that	13
we	13
should	13
take	13
a	13
vessel	13
in	13
which	13
we	13
could	13
more	13
safely	13
accomplish	13
our	13
voyage.	13
As	13
we	13
pursued	13
our	13
course	13
Zoraida	13
kept	13
her	13
head	13
between	13
my	13
hands	13
so	13
as	13
not	13
to	13
see	13
her	13
father,	13
and	13
I	13
felt	13
that	13
she	13
was	13
praying	13
to	13
Lela	13
Marien	13
to	13
help	13
us.	13

We	13
might	13
have	13
made	13
about	13
thirty	13
miles	13
when	13
daybreak	13
found	13
us	13
some	13
three	13
musket-shots	13
off	13
the	13
land,	13
which	13
seemed	13
to	13
us	13
deserted,	13
and	13
without	13
anyone	13
to	13
see	13
us.	13
For	13
all	13
that,	13
however,	13
by	13
hard	13
rowing	13
we	13
put	13
out	13
a	13
little	13
to	13
sea,	13
for	13
it	13
was	13
now	13
somewhat	13
calmer,	13
and	13
having	13
gained	13
about	13
two	13
leagues	13
the	13
word	13
was	13
given	13
to	13
row	13
by	13
batches,	13
while	13
we	13
ate	13
something,	13
for	13
the	13
vessel	13
was	13
well	13
provided;	13
but	13
the	13
rowers	13
said	13
it	13
was	13
not	13
a	13
time	13
to	13
take	13
any	13
rest;	13
let	13
food	13
be	13
served	13
out	13
to	13
those	13
who	13
were	13
not	13
rowing,	13
but	13
they	13
would	13
not	13
leave	13
their	13
oars	13
on	13
any	13
account.	13
This	13
was	13
done,	13
but	13
now	13
a	13
stiff	13
breeze	13
began	13
to	13
blow,	13
which	13
obliged	13
us	13
to	13
leave	13
off	13
rowing	13
and	13
make	13
sail	13
at	13
once	13
and	13
steer	13
for	13
Oran,	13
as	13
it	13
was	13
impossible	13
to	13
make	13
any	13
other	13
course.	13
All	13
this	13
was	13
done	13
very	13
promptly,	13
and	13
under	13
sail	13
we	13
ran	13
more	13
than	13
eight	13
miles	13
an	13
hour	13
without	13
any	13
fear,	13
except	13
that	13
of	13
coming	13
across	13
some	13
vessel	13
out	13
on	13
a	13
roving	13
expedition.	13
We	13
gave	13
the	13
Moorish	13
rowers	13
some	13
food,	13
and	13
the	13
renegade	13
comforted	13
them	13
by	13
telling	13
them	13
that	13
they	13
were	13
not	13
held	13
as	13
captives,	13
as	13
we	13
should	13
set	13
them	13
free	13
on	13
the	13
first	13
opportunity.	13
The	13
same	13
was	13
said	13
to	13
Zoraida’s	13
father,	13
who	13
replied,	13
“Anything	13
else,	13
Christian,	13
I	13
might	13
hope	13
for	13
or	13
think	13
likely	13
from	13
your	13
generosity	13
and	13
good	13
behaviour,	13
but	13
do	13
not	13
think	13
me	13
so	13
simple	13
as	13
to	13
imagine	13
you	13
will	13
give	13
me	13
my	13
liberty;	13
for	13
you	13
would	13
have	13
never	13
exposed	13
yourselves	13
to	13
the	13
danger	13
of	13
depriving	13
me	13
of	13
it	13
only	13
to	13
restore	13
it	13
to	13
me	13
so	13
generously,	13
especially	13
as	13
you	13
know	13
who	13
I	13
am	13
and	13
the	13
sum	13
you	13
may	13
expect	13
to	13
receive	13
on	13
restoring	13
it;	13
and	13
if	13
you	13
will	13
only	13
name	13
that,	13
I	13
here	13
offer	13
you	13
all	13
you	13
require	13
for	13
myself	13
and	13
for	13
my	13
unhappy	13
daughter	13
there;	13
or	13
else	13
for	13
her	13
alone,	13
for	13
she	13
is	13
the	13
greatest	13
and	13
most	13
precious	13
part	13
of	13
my	13
soul.”	13
As	13
he	13
said	13
this	13
he	13
began	13
to	13
weep	13
so	13
bitterly	13
that	13
he	13
filled	13
us	13
all	13
with	13
compassion	13
and	13
forced	13
Zoraida	13
to	13
look	13
at	13
him,	13
and	13
when	13
she	13
saw	13
him	13
weeping	13
she	13
was	13
so	13
moved	13
that	13
she	13
rose	13
from	13
my	13
feet	13
and	13
ran	13
to	13
throw	13
her	13
arms	13
round	13
him,	13
and	13
pressing	13
her	13
face	13
to	13
his,	13
they	13
both	13
gave	13
way	13
to	13
such	13
an	13
outburst	13
of	13
tears	13
that	13
several	13
of	13
us	13
were	13
constrained	13
to	13
keep	13
them	13
company.	13
But	13
when	13
her	13
father	13
saw	13
her	13
in	13
full	13
dress	13
and	13
with	13
all	13
her	13
jewels	13
about	13
her,	13
he	13
said	13
to	13
her	13
in	13
his	13
own	13
language,	13
“What	13
means	13
this,	13
my	13
daughter?	13
Last	13
night,	13
before	13
this	13
terrible	13
misfortune	13
in	13
which	13
we	13
are	13
plunged	13
befell	13
us,	13
I	13
saw	13
thee	13
in	13
thy	13
everyday	13
and	13
indoor	13
garments;	13
and	13
now,	13
without	13
having	13
had	13
time	13
to	13
attire	13
thyself,	13
and	13
without	13
my	13
bringing	13
thee	13
any	13
joyful	13
tidings	13
to	13
furnish	13
an	13
occasion	13
for	13
adorning	13
and	13
bedecking	13
thyself,	13
I	13
see	13
thee	13
arrayed	13
in	13
the	13
finest	13
attire	13
it	13
would	13
be	13
in	13
my	13
power	13
to	13
give	13
thee	13
when	13
fortune	13
was	13
most	13
kind	13
to	13
us.	13
Answer	13
me	13
this;	13
for	13
it	13
causes	13
me	13
greater	13
anxiety	13
and	13
surprise	13
than	13
even	13
this	13
misfortune	13
itself.”	13
The	13
renegade	13
interpreted	13
to	13
us	13
what	13
the	13
Moor	13
said	13
to	13
his	13
daughter;	13
she,	13
however,	13
returned	13
him	13
no	13
answer.	13
But	13
when	13
he	13
observed	13
in	13
one	13
corner	13
of	13
the	13
vessel	13
the	13
little	13
trunk	13
in	13
which	13
she	13
used	13
to	13
keep	13
her	13
jewels,	13
which	13
he	13
well	13
knew	13
he	13
had	13
left	13
in	13
Algiers	13
and	13
had	13
not	13
brought	13
to	13
the	13
garden,	13
he	13
was	13
still	13
more	13
amazed,	13
and	13
asked	13
her	13
how	13
that	13
trunk	13
had	13
come	13
into	13
our	13
hands,	13
and	13
what	13
there	13
was	13
in	13
it.	13
To	13
which	13
the	13
renegade,	13
without	13
waiting	13
for	13
Zoraida	13
to	13
reply,	13
made	13
answer,	13
“Do	13
not	13
trouble	13
thyself	13
by	13
asking	13
thy	13
daughter	13
Zoraida	13
so	13
many	13
questions,	13
señor,	13
for	13
the	13
one	13
answer	13
I	13
will	13
give	13
thee	13
will	13
serve	13
for	13
all;	13
I	13
would	13
have	13
thee	13
know	13
that	13
she	13
is	13
a	13
Christian,	13
and	13
that	13
it	13
is	13
she	13
who	13
has	13
been	13
the	13
file	13
for	13
our	13
chains	13
and	13
our	13
deliverer	13
from	13
captivity.	13
She	13
is	13
here	13
of	13
her	13
own	13
free	13
will,	13
as	13
glad,	13
I	13
imagine,	13
to	13
find	13
herself	13
in	13
this	13
position	13
as	13
he	13
who	13
escapes	13
from	13
darkness	13
into	13
the	13
light,	13
from	13
death	13
to	13
life,	13
and	13
from	13
suffering	13
to	13
glory.”	13
“Daughter,	13
is	13
this	13
true,	13
what	13
he	13
says?”	13
cried	13
the	13
Moor.	13
“It	13
is,”	13
replied	13
Zoraida.	13
“That	13
thou	13
art	13
in	13
truth	13
a	13
Christian,”	13
said	13
the	13
old	13
man,	13
“and	13
that	13
thou	13
hast	13
given	13
thy	13
father	13
into	13
the	13
power	13
of	13
his	13
enemies?”	13
To	13
which	13
Zoraida	13
made	13
answer,	13
“A	13
Christian	13
I	13
am,	13
but	13
it	13
is	13
not	13
I	13
who	13
have	13
placed	13
thee	13
in	13
this	13
position,	13
for	13
it	13
never	13
was	13
my	13
wish	13
to	13
leave	13
thee	13
or	13
do	13
thee	13
harm,	13
but	13
only	13
to	13
do	13
good	13
to	13
myself.”	13
“And	13
what	13
good	13
hast	13
thou	13
done	13
thyself,	13
daughter?”	13
said	13
he.	13
“Ask	13
thou	13
that,”	13
said	13
she,	13
“of	13
Lela	13
Marien,	13
for	13
she	13
can	13
tell	13
thee	13
better	13
than	13
I.”	13
The	13
Moor	13
had	13
hardly	13
heard	13
these	13
words	13
when	13
with	13
marvellous	13
quickness	13
he	13
flung	13
himself	13
headforemost	13
into	13
the	13
sea,	13
where	13
no	13
doubt	13
he	13
would	13
have	13
been	13
drowned	13
had	13
not	13
the	13
long	13
and	13
full	13
dress	13
he	13
wore	13
held	13
him	13
up	13
for	13
a	13
little	13
on	13
the	13
surface	13
of	13
the	13
water.	13
Zoraida	13
cried	13
aloud	13
to	13
us	13
to	13
save	13
him,	13
and	13
we	13
all	13
hastened	13
to	13
help,	13
and	13
seizing	13
him	13
by	13
his	13
robe	13
we	13
drew	13
him	13
in	13
half	13
drowned	13
and	13
insensible,	13
at	13
which	13
Zoraida	13
was	13
in	13
such	13
distress	13
that	13
she	13
wept	13
over	13
him	13
as	13
piteously	13
and	13
bitterly	13
as	13
though	13
he	13
were	13
already	13
dead.	13
We	13
turned	13
him	13
upon	13
his	13
face	13
and	13
he	13
voided	13
a	13
great	13
quantity	13
of	13
water,	13
and	13
at	13
the	13
end	13
of	13
two	13
hours	13
came	13
to	13
himself.	13
Meanwhile,	13
the	13
wind	13
having	13
changed	13
we	13
were	13
compelled	13
to	13
head	13
for	13
the	13
land,	13
and	13
ply	13
our	13
oars	13
to	13
avoid	13
being	13
driven	13
on	13
shore;	13
but	13
it	13
was	13
our	13
good	13
fortune	13
to	13
reach	13
a	13
creek	13
that	13
lies	13
on	13
one	13
side	13
of	13
a	13
small	13
promontory	13
or	13
cape,	13
called	13
by	13
the	13
Moors	13
that	13
of	13
the	13
“Cava	13
rumia,”	13
which	13
in	13
our	13
language	13
means	13
“the	13
wicked	13
Christian	13
woman;”	13
for	13
it	13
is	13
a	13
tradition	13
among	13
them	13
that	13
La	13
Cava,	13
through	13
whom	13
Spain	13
was	13
lost,	13
lies	13
buried	13
at	13
that	13
spot;	13
“cava”	13
in	13
their	13
language	13
meaning	13
“wicked	13
woman,”	13
and	13
“rumia”	13
“Christian;”	13
moreover,	13
they	13
count	13
it	13
unlucky	13
to	13
anchor	13
there	13
when	13
necessity	13
compels	13
them,	13
and	13
they	13
never	13
do	13
so	13
otherwise.	13
For	13
us,	13
however,	13
it	13
was	13
not	13
the	13
resting-place	13
of	13
the	13
wicked	13
woman	13
but	13
a	13
haven	13
of	13
safety	13
for	13
our	13
relief,	13
so	13
much	13
had	13
the	13
sea	13
now	13
got	13
up.	13
We	13
posted	13
a	13
look-out	13
on	13
shore,	13
and	13
never	13
let	13
the	13
oars	13
out	13
of	13
our	13
hands,	13
and	13
ate	13
of	13
the	13
stores	13
the	13
renegade	13
had	13
laid	13
in,	13
imploring	13
God	13
and	13
Our	13
Lady	13
with	13
all	13
our	13
hearts	13
to	13
help	13
and	13
protect	13
us,	13
that	13
we	13
might	13
give	13
a	13
happy	13
ending	13
to	13
a	13
beginning	13
so	13
prosperous.	13
At	13
the	13
entreaty	13
of	13
Zoraida	13
orders	13
were	13
given	13
to	13
set	13
on	13
shore	13
her	13
father	13
and	13
the	13
other	13
Moors	13
who	13
were	13
still	13
bound,	13
for	13
she	13
could	13
not	13
endure,	13
nor	13
could	13
her	13
tender	13
heart	13
bear	13
to	13
see	13
her	13
father	13
in	13
bonds	13
and	13
her	13
fellow-countrymen	13
prisoners	13
before	13
her	13
eyes.	13
We	13
promised	13
her	13
to	13
do	13
this	13
at	13
the	13
moment	13
of	13
departure,	13
for	13
as	13
it	13
was	13
uninhabited	13
we	13
ran	13
no	13
risk	13
in	13
releasing	13
them	13
at	13
that	13
place.	13
Our	13
prayers	13
were	13
not	13
so	13
far	13
in	13
vain	13
as	13
to	13
be	13
unheard	13
by	13
Heaven,	13
for	13
after	13
a	13
while	13
the	13
wind	13
changed	13
in	13
our	13
favour,	13
and	13
made	13
the	13
sea	13
calm,	13
inviting	13
us	13
once	13
more	13
to	13
resume	13
our	13
voyage	13
with	13
a	13
good	13
heart.	13
Seeing	13
this	13
we	13
unbound	13
the	13
Moors,	13
and	13
one	13
by	13
one	13
put	13
them	13
on	13
shore,	13
at	13
which	13
they	13
were	13
filled	13
with	13
amazement;	13
but	13
when	13
we	13
came	13
to	13
land	13
Zoraida’s	13
father,	13
who	13
had	13
now	13
completely	13
recovered	13
his	13
senses,	13
he	13
said:	13
“Why	13
is	13
it,	13
think	13
ye,	13
Christians,	13
that	13
this	13
wicked	13
woman	13
is	13
rejoiced	13
at	13
your	13
giving	13
me	13
my	13
liberty?	13
Think	13
ye	13
it	13
is	13
because	13
of	13
the	13
affection	13
she	13
bears	13
me?	13
Nay	13
verily,	13
it	13
is	13
only	13
because	13
of	13
the	13
hindrance	13
my	13
presence	13
offers	13
to	13
the	13
execution	13
of	13
her	13
base	13
designs.	13
And	13
think	13
not	13
that	13
it	13
is	13
her	13
belief	13
that	13
yours	13
is	13
better	13
than	13
ours	13
that	13
has	13
led	13
her	13
to	13
change	13
her	13
religion;	13
it	13
is	13
only	13
because	13
she	13
knows	13
that	13
immodesty	13
is	13
more	13
freely	13
practised	13
in	13
your	13
country	13
than	13
in	13
ours.”	13
Then	13
turning	13
to	13
Zoraida,	13
while	13
I	13
and	13
another	13
of	13
the	13
Christians	13
held	13
him	13
fast	13
by	13
both	13
arms,	13
lest	13
he	13
should	13
do	13
some	13
mad	13
act,	13
he	13
said	13
to	13
her,	13
“Infamous	13
girl,	13
misguided	13
maiden,	13
whither	13
in	13
thy	13
blindness	13
and	13
madness	13
art	13
thou	13
going	13
in	13
the	13
hands	13
of	13
these	13
dogs,	13
our	13
natural	13
enemies?	13
Cursed	13
be	13
the	13
hour	13
when	13
I	13
begot	13
thee!	13
Cursed	13
the	13
luxury	13
and	13
indulgence	13
in	13
which	13
I	13
reared	13
thee!”	13
But	13
seeing	13
that	13
he	13
was	13
not	13
likely	13
soon	13
to	13
cease	13
I	13
made	13
haste	13
to	13
put	13
him	13
on	13
shore,	13
and	13
thence	13
he	13
continued	13
his	13
maledictions	13
and	13
lamentations	13
aloud;	13
calling	13
on	13
Mohammed	13
to	13
pray	13
to	13
Allah	13
to	13
destroy	13
us,	13
to	13
confound	13
us,	13
to	13
make	13
an	13
end	13
of	13
us;	13
and	13
when,	13
in	13
consequence	13
of	13
having	13
made	13
sail,	13
we	13
could	13
no	13
longer	13
hear	13
what	13
he	13
said	13
we	13
could	13
see	13
what	13
he	13
did;	13
how	13
he	13
plucked	13
out	13
his	13
beard	13
and	13
tore	13
his	13
hair	13
and	13
lay	13
writhing	13
on	13
the	13
ground.	13
But	13
once	13
he	13
raised	13
his	13
voice	13
to	13
such	13
a	13
pitch	13
that	13
we	13
were	13
able	13
to	13
hear	13
what	13
he	13
said.	13
“Come	13
back,	13
dear	13
daughter,	13
come	13
back	13
to	13
shore;	13
I	13
forgive	13
thee	13
all;	13
let	13
those	13
men	13
have	13
the	13
money,	13
for	13
it	13
is	13
theirs	13
now,	13
and	13
come	13
back	13
to	13
comfort	13
thy	13
sorrowing	13
father,	13
who	13
will	13
yield	13
up	13
his	13
life	13
on	13
this	13
barren	13
strand	13
if	13
thou	13
dost	13
leave	13
him.”	13

All	13
this	13
Zoraida	13
heard,	13
and	13
heard	13
with	13
sorrow	13
and	13
tears,	13
and	13
all	13
she	13
could	13
say	13
in	13
answer	13
was,	13
“Allah	13
grant	13
that	13
Lela	13
Marien,	13
who	13
has	13
made	13
me	13
become	13
a	13
Christian,	13
give	13
thee	13
comfort	13
in	13
thy	13
sorrow,	13
my	13
father.	13
Allah	13
knows	13
that	13
I	13
could	13
not	13
do	13
otherwise	13
than	13
I	13
have	13
done,	13
and	13
that	13
these	13
Christians	13
owe	13
nothing	13
to	13
my	13
will;	13
for	13
even	13
had	13
I	13
wished	13
not	13
to	13
accompany	13
them,	13
but	13
remain	13
at	13
home,	13
it	13
would	13
have	13
been	13
impossible	13
for	13
me,	13
so	13
eagerly	13
did	13
my	13
soul	13
urge	13
me	13
on	13
to	13
the	13
accomplishment	13
of	13
this	13
purpose,	13
which	13
I	13
feel	13
to	13
be	13
as	13
righteous	13
as	13
to	13
thee,	13
dear	13
father,	13
it	13
seems	13
wicked.”	13
But	13
neither	13
could	13
her	13
father	13
hear	13
her	13
nor	13
we	13
see	13
him	13
when	13
she	13
said	13
this;	13
and	13
so,	13
while	13
I	13
consoled	13
Zoraida,	13
we	13
turned	13
our	13
attention	13
to	13
our	13
voyage,	13
in	13
which	13
a	13
breeze	13
from	13
the	13
right	13
point	13
so	13
favoured	13
us	13
that	13
we	13
made	13
sure	13
of	13
finding	13
ourselves	13
off	13
the	13
coast	13
of	13
Spain	13
on	13
the	13
morrow	13
by	13
daybreak.	13
But,	13
as	13
good	13
seldom	13
or	13
never	13
comes	13
pure	13
and	13
unmixed,	13
without	13
being	13
attended	13
or	13
followed	13
by	13
some	13
disturbing	13
evil	13
that	13
gives	13
a	13
shock	13
to	13
it,	13
our	13
fortune,	13
or	13
perhaps	13
the	13
curses	13
which	13
the	13
Moor	13
had	13
hurled	13
at	13
his	13
daughter	13
(for	13
whatever	13
kind	13
of	13
father	13
they	13
may	13
come	13
from	13
these	13
are	13
always	13
to	13
be	13
dreaded),	13
brought	13
it	13
about	13
that	13
when	13
we	13
were	13
now	13
in	13
mid-sea,	13
and	13
the	13
night	13
about	13
three	13
hours	13
spent,	13
as	13
we	13
were	13
running	13
with	13
all	13
sail	13
set	13
and	13
oars	13
lashed,	13
for	13
the	13
favouring	13
breeze	13
saved	13
us	13
the	13
trouble	13
of	13
using	13
them,	13
we	13
saw	13
by	13
the	13
light	13
of	13
the	13
moon,	13
which	13
shone	13
brilliantly,	13
a	13
square-rigged	13
vessel	13
in	13
full	13
sail	13
close	13
to	13
us,	13
luffing	13
up	13
and	13
standing	13
across	13
our	13
course,	13
and	13
so	13
close	13
that	13
we	13
had	13
to	13
strike	13
sail	13
to	13
avoid	13
running	13
foul	13
of	13
her,	13
while	13
they	13
too	13
put	13
the	13
helm	13
hard	13
up	13
to	13
let	13
us	13
pass.	13
They	13
came	13
to	13
the	13
side	13
of	13
the	13
ship	13
to	13
ask	13
who	13
we	13
were,	13
whither	13
we	13
were	13
bound,	13
and	13
whence	13
we	13
came,	13
but	13
as	13
they	13
asked	13
this	13
in	13
French	13
our	13
renegade	13
said,	13
“Let	13
no	13
one	13
answer,	13
for	13
no	13
doubt	13
these	13
are	13
French	13
corsairs	13
who	13
plunder	13
all	13
comers.”	13

Acting	13
on	13
this	13
warning	13
no	13
one	13
answered	13
a	13
word,	13
but	13
after	13
we	13
had	13
gone	13
a	13
little	13
ahead,	13
and	13
the	13
vessel	13
was	13
now	13
lying	13
to	13
leeward,	13
suddenly	13
they	13
fired	13
two	13
guns,	13
and	13
apparently	13
both	13
loaded	13
with	13
chain-shot,	13
for	13
with	13
one	13
they	13
cut	13
our	13
mast	13
in	13
half	13
and	13
brought	13
down	13
both	13
it	13
and	13
the	13
sail	13
into	13
the	13
sea,	13
and	13
the	13
other,	13
discharged	13
at	13
the	13
same	13
moment,	13
sent	13
a	13
ball	13
into	13
our	13
vessel	13
amidships,	13
staving	13
her	13
in	13
completely,	13
but	13
without	13
doing	13
any	13
further	13
damage.	13
We,	13
however,	13
finding	13
ourselves	13
sinking	13
began	13
to	13
shout	13
for	13
help	13
and	13
call	13
upon	13
those	13
in	13
the	13
ship	13
to	13
pick	13
us	13
up	13
as	13
we	13
were	13
beginning	13
to	13
fill.	13
They	13
then	13
lay	13
to,	13
and	13
lowering	13
a	13
skiff	13
or	13
boat,	13
as	13
many	13
as	13
a	13
dozen	13
Frenchmen,	13
well	13
armed	13
with	13
match-locks,	13
and	13
their	13
matches	13
burning,	13
got	13
into	13
it	13
and	13
came	13
alongside;	13
and	13
seeing	13
how	13
few	13
we	13
were,	13
and	13
that	13
our	13
vessel	13
was	13
going	13
down,	13
they	13
took	13
us	13
in,	13
telling	13
us	13
that	13
this	13
had	13
come	13
to	13
us	13
through	13
our	13
incivility	13
in	13
not	13
giving	13
them	13
an	13
answer.	13
Our	13
renegade	13
took	13
the	13
trunk	13
containing	13
Zoraida’s	13
wealth	13
and	13
dropped	13
it	13
into	13
the	13
sea	13
without	13
anyone	13
perceiving	13
what	13
he	13
did.	13
In	13
short	13
we	13
went	13
on	13
board	13
with	13
the	13
Frenchmen,	13
who,	13
after	13
having	13
ascertained	13
all	13
they	13
wanted	13
to	13
know	13
about	13
us,	13
rifled	13
us	13
of	13
everything	13
we	13
had,	13
as	13
if	13
they	13
had	13
been	13
our	13
bitterest	13
enemies,	13
and	13
from	13
Zoraida	13
they	13
took	13
even	13
the	13
anklets	13
she	13
wore	13
on	13
her	13
feet;	13
but	13
the	13
distress	13
they	13
caused	13
her	13
did	13
not	13
distress	13
me	13
so	13
much	13
as	13
the	13
fear	13
I	13
was	13
in	13
that	13
from	13
robbing	13
her	13
of	13
her	13
rich	13
and	13
precious	13
jewels	13
they	13
would	13
proceed	13
to	13
rob	13
her	13
of	13
the	13
most	13
precious	13
jewel	13
that	13
she	13
valued	13
more	13
than	13
all.	13
The	13
desires,	13
however,	13
of	13
those	13
people	13
do	13
not	13
go	13
beyond	13
money,	13
but	13
of	13
that	13
their	13
covetousness	13
is	13
insatiable,	13
and	13
on	13
this	13
occasion	13
it	13
was	13
carried	13
to	13
such	13
a	13
pitch	13
that	13
they	13
would	13
have	13
taken	13
even	13
the	13
clothes	13
we	13
wore	13
as	13
captives	13
if	13
they	13
had	13
been	13
worth	13
anything	13
to	13
them.	13
It	13
was	13
the	13
advice	13
of	13
some	13
of	13
them	13
to	13
throw	13
us	13
all	13
into	13
the	13
sea	13
wrapped	13
up	13
in	13
a	13
sail;	13
for	13
their	13
purpose	13
was	13
to	13
trade	13
at	13
some	13
of	13
the	13
ports	13
of	13
Spain,	13
giving	13
themselves	13
out	13
as	13
Bretons,	13
and	13
if	13
they	13
brought	13
us	13
alive	13
they	13
would	13
be	13
punished	13
as	13
soon	13
as	13
the	13
robbery	13
was	13
discovered;	13
but	13
the	13
captain	13
(who	13
was	13
the	13
one	13
who	13
had	13
plundered	13
my	13
beloved	13
Zoraida)	13
said	13
he	13
was	13
satisfied	13
with	13
the	13
prize	13
he	13
had	13
got,	13
and	13
that	13
he	13
would	13
not	13
touch	13
at	13
any	13
Spanish	13
port,	13
but	13
pass	13
the	13
Straits	13
of	13
Gibraltar	13
by	13
night,	13
or	13
as	13
best	13
he	13
could,	13
and	13
make	13
for	13
La	13
Rochelle,	13
from	13
which	13
he	13
had	13
sailed.	13
So	13
they	13
agreed	13
by	13
common	13
consent	13
to	13
give	13
us	13
the	13
skiff	13
belonging	13
to	13
their	13
ship	13
and	13
all	13
we	13
required	13
for	13
the	13
short	13
voyage	13
that	13
remained	13
to	13
us,	13
and	13
this	13
they	13
did	13
the	13
next	13
day	13
on	13
coming	13
in	13
sight	13
of	13
the	13
Spanish	13
coast,	13
with	13
which,	13
and	13
the	13
joy	13
we	13
felt,	13
all	13
our	13
sufferings	13
and	13
miseries	13
were	13
as	13
completely	13
forgotten	13
as	13
if	13
they	13
had	13
never	13
been	13
endured	13
by	13
us,	13
such	13
is	13
the	13
delight	13
of	13
recovering	13
lost	13
liberty.	13
It	13
may	13
have	13
been	13
about	13
mid-day	13
when	13
they	13
placed	13
us	13
in	13
the	13
boat,	13
giving	13
us	13
two	13
kegs	13
of	13
water	13
and	13
some	13
biscuit;	13
and	13
the	13
captain,	13
moved	13
by	13
I	13
know	13
not	13
what	13
compassion,	13
as	13
the	13
lovely	13
Zoraida	13
was	13
about	13
to	13
embark,	13
gave	13
her	13
some	13
forty	13
gold	13
crowns,	13
and	13
would	13
not	13
permit	13
his	13
men	13
to	13
take	13
from	13
her	13
those	13
same	13
garments	13
which	13
she	13
has	13
on	13
now.	13
We	13
got	13
into	13
the	13
boat,	13
returning	13
them	13
thanks	13
for	13
their	13
kindness	13
to	13
us,	13
and	13
showing	13
ourselves	13
grateful	13
rather	13
than	13
indignant.	13
They	13
stood	13
out	13
to	13
sea,	13
steering	13
for	13
the	13
straits;	13
we,	13
without	13
looking	13
to	13
any	13
compass	13
save	13
the	13
land	13
we	13
had	13
before	13
us,	13
set	13
ourselves	13
to	13
row	13
with	13
such	13
energy	13
that	13
by	13
sunset	13
we	13
were	13
so	13
near	13
that	13
we	13
might	13
easily,	13
we	13
thought,	13
land	13
before	13
the	13
night	13
was	13
far	13
advanced.	13
But	13
as	13
the	13
moon	13
did	13
not	13
show	13
that	13
night,	13
and	13
the	13
sky	13
was	13
clouded,	13
and	13
as	13
we	13
knew	13
not	13
whereabouts	13
we	13
were,	13
it	13
did	13
not	13
seem	13
to	13
us	13
a	13
prudent	13
thing	13
to	13
make	13
for	13
the	13
shore,	13
as	13
several	13
of	13
us	13
advised,	13
saying	13
we	13
ought	13
to	13
run	13
ourselves	13
ashore	13
even	13
if	13
it	13
were	13
on	13
rocks	13
and	13
far	13
from	13
any	13
habitation,	13
for	13
in	13
this	13
way	13
we	13
should	13
be	13
relieved	13
from	13
the	13
apprehensions	13
we	13
naturally	13
felt	13
of	13
the	13
prowling	13
vessels	13
of	13
the	13
Tetuan	13
corsairs,	13
who	13
leave	13
Barbary	13
at	13
nightfall	13
and	13
are	13
on	13
the	13
Spanish	13
coast	13
by	13
daybreak,	13
where	13
they	13
commonly	13
take	13
some	13
prize,	13
and	13
then	13
go	13
home	13
to	13
sleep	13
in	13
their	13
own	13
houses.	13
But	13
of	13
the	13
conflicting	13
counsels	13
the	13
one	13
which	13
was	13
adopted	13
was	13
that	13
we	13
should	13
approach	13
gradually,	13
and	13
land	13
where	13
we	13
could	13
if	13
the	13
sea	13
were	13
calm	13
enough	13
to	13
permit	13
us.	13
This	13
was	13
done,	13
and	13
a	13
little	13
before	13
midnight	13
we	13
drew	13
near	13
to	13
the	13
foot	13
of	13
a	13
huge	13
and	13
lofty	13
mountain,	13
not	13
so	13
close	13
to	13
the	13
sea	13
but	13
that	13
it	13
left	13
a	13
narrow	13
space	13
on	13
which	13
to	13
land	13
conveniently.	13
We	13
ran	13
our	13
boat	13
up	13
on	13
the	13
sand,	13
and	13
all	13
sprang	13
out	13
and	13
kissed	13
the	13
ground,	13
and	13
with	13
tears	13
of	13
joyful	13
satisfaction	13
returned	13
thanks	13
to	13
God	13
our	13
Lord	13
for	13
all	13
his	13
incomparable	13
goodness	13
to	13
us	13
on	13
our	13
voyage.	13
We	13
took	13
out	13
of	13
the	13
boat	13
the	13
provisions	13
it	13
contained,	13
and	13
drew	13
it	13
up	13
on	13
the	13
shore,	13
and	13
then	13
climbed	13
a	13
long	13
way	13
up	13
the	13
mountain,	13
for	13
even	13
there	13
we	13
could	13
not	13
feel	13
easy	13
in	13
our	13
hearts,	13
or	13
persuade	13
ourselves	13
that	13
it	13
was	13
Christian	13
soil	13
that	13
was	13
now	13
under	13
our	13
feet.	13
The	13
dawn	13
came,	13
more	13
slowly,	13
I	13
think,	13
than	13
we	13
could	13
have	13
wished;	13
we	13
completed	13
the	13
ascent	13
in	13
order	13
to	13
see	13
if	13
from	13
the	13
summit	13
any	13
habitation	13
or	13
any	13
shepherds’	13
huts	13
could	13
be	13
discovered,	13
but	13
strain	13
our	13
eyes	13
as	13
we	13
might,	13
neither	13
dwelling,	13
nor	13
human	13
being,	13
nor	13
path	13
nor	13
road	13
could	13
we	13
perceive.	13
However,	13
we	13
determined	13
to	13
push	13
on	13
farther,	13
as	13
it	13
could	13
not	13
but	13
be	13
that	13
ere	13
long	13
we	13
must	13
see	13
someone	13
who	13
could	13
tell	13
us	13
where	13
we	13
were.	13
But	13
what	13
distressed	13
me	13
most	13
was	13
to	13
see	13
Zoraida	13
going	13
on	13
foot	13
over	13
that	13
rough	13
ground;	13
for	13
though	13
I	13
once	13
carried	13
her	13
on	13
my	13
shoulders,	13
she	13
was	13
more	13
wearied	13
by	13
my	13
weariness	13
than	13
rested	13
by	13
the	13
rest;	13
and	13
so	13
she	13
would	13
never	13
again	13
allow	13
me	13
to	13
undergo	13
the	13
exertion,	13
and	13
went	13
on	13
very	13
patiently	13
and	13
cheerfully,	13
while	13
I	13
led	13
her	13
by	13
the	13
hand.	13
We	13
had	13
gone	13
rather	13
less	13
than	13
a	13
quarter	13
of	13
a	13
league	13
when	13
the	13
sound	13
of	13
a	13
little	13
bell	13
fell	13
on	13
our	13
ears,	13
a	13
clear	13
proof	13
that	13
there	13
were	13
flocks	13
hard	13
by,	13
and	13
looking	13
about	13
carefully	13
to	13
see	13
if	13
any	13
were	13
within	13
view,	13
we	13
observed	13
a	13
young	13
shepherd	13
tranquilly	13
and	13
unsuspiciously	13
trimming	13
a	13
stick	13
with	13
his	13
knife	13
at	13
the	13
foot	13
of	13
a	13
cork	13
tree.	13
We	13
called	13
to	13
him,	13
and	13
he,	13
raising	13
his	13
head,	13
sprang	13
nimbly	13
to	13
his	13
feet,	13
for,	13
as	13
we	13
afterwards	13
learned,	13
the	13
first	13
who	13
presented	13
themselves	13
to	13
his	13
sight	13
were	13
the	13
renegade	13
and	13
Zoraida,	13
and	13
seeing	13
them	13
in	13
Moorish	13
dress	13
he	13
imagined	13
that	13
all	13
the	13
Moors	13
of	13
Barbary	13
were	13
upon	13
him;	13
and	13
plunging	13
with	13
marvellous	13
swiftness	13
into	13
the	13
thicket	13
in	13
front	13
of	13
him,	13
he	13
began	13
to	13
raise	13
a	13
prodigious	13
outcry,	13
exclaiming,	13
“The	13
Moors—the	13
Moors	13
have	13
landed!	13
To	13
arms,	13
to	13
arms!”	13
We	13
were	13
all	13
thrown	13
into	13
perplexity	13
by	13
these	13
cries,	13
not	13
knowing	13
what	13
to	13
do;	13
but	13
reflecting	13
that	13
the	13
shouts	13
of	13
the	13
shepherd	13
would	13
raise	13
the	13
country	13
and	13
that	13
the	13
mounted	13
coast-guard	13
would	13
come	13
at	13
once	13
to	13
see	13
what	13
was	13
the	13
matter,	13
we	13
agreed	13
that	13
the	13
renegade	13
must	13
strip	13
off	13
his	13
Turkish	13
garments	13
and	13
put	13
on	13
a	13
captive’s	13
jacket	13
or	13
coat	13
which	13
one	13
of	13
our	13
party	13
gave	13
him	13
at	13
once,	13
though	13
he	13
himself	13
was	13
reduced	13
to	13
his	13
shirt;	13
and	13
so	13
commending	13
ourselves	13
to	13
God,	13
we	13
followed	13
the	13
same	13
road	13
which	13
we	13
saw	13
the	13
shepherd	13
take,	13
expecting	13
every	13
moment	13
that	13
the	13
coast-guard	13
would	13
be	13
down	13
upon	13
us.	13
Nor	13
did	13
our	13
expectation	13
deceive	13
us,	13
for	13
two	13
hours	13
had	13
not	13
passed	13
when,	13
coming	13
out	13
of	13
the	13
brushwood	13
into	13
the	13
open	13
ground,	13
we	13
perceived	13
some	13
fifty	13
mounted	13
men	13
swiftly	13
approaching	13
us	13
at	13
a	13
hand-gallop.	13
As	13
soon	13
as	13
we	13
saw	13
them	13
we	13
stood	13
still,	13
waiting	13
for	13
them;	13
but	13
as	13
they	13
came	13
close	13
and,	13
instead	13
of	13
the	13
Moors	13
they	13
were	13
in	13
quest	13
of,	13
saw	13
a	13
set	13
of	13
poor	13
Christians,	13
they	13
were	13
taken	13
aback,	13
and	13
one	13
of	13
them	13
asked	13
if	13
it	13
could	13
be	13
we	13
who	13
were	13
the	13
cause	13
of	13
the	13
shepherd	13
having	13
raised	13
the	13
call	13
to	13
arms.	13
I	13
said	13
“Yes,”	13
and	13
as	13
I	13
was	13
about	13
to	13
explain	13
to	13
him	13
what	13
had	13
occurred,	13
and	13
whence	13
we	13
came	13
and	13
who	13
we	13
were,	13
one	13
of	13
the	13
Christians	13
of	13
our	13
party	13
recognised	13
the	13
horseman	13
who	13
had	13
put	13
the	13
question	13
to	13
us,	13
and	13
before	13
I	13
could	13
say	13
anything	13
more	13
he	13
exclaimed:	13
“Thanks	13
be	13
to	13
God,	13
sirs,	13
for	13
bringing	13
us	13
to	13
such	13
good	13
quarters;	13
for,	13
if	13
I	13
do	13
not	13
deceive	13
myself,	13
the	13
ground	13
we	13
stand	13
on	13
is	13
that	13
of	13
Velez	13
Malaga	13
unless,	13
indeed,	13
all	13
my	13
years	13
of	13
captivity	13
have	13
made	13
me	13
unable	13
to	13
recollect	13
that	13
you,	13
señor,	13
who	13
ask	13
who	13
we	13
are,	13
are	13
Pedro	13
de	13
Bustamante,	13
my	13
uncle.”	13
The	13
Christian	13
captive	13
had	13
hardly	13
uttered	13
these	13
words,	13
when	13
the	13
horseman	13
threw	13
himself	13
off	13
his	13
horse,	13
and	13
ran	13
to	13
embrace	13
the	13
young	13
man,	13
crying:	13
“Nephew	13
of	13
my	13
soul	13
and	13
life!	13
I	13
recognise	13
thee	13
now;	13
and	13
long	13
have	13
I	13
mourned	13
thee	13
as	13
dead,	13
I,	13
and	13
my	13
sister,	13
thy	13
mother,	13
and	13
all	13
thy	13
kin	13
that	13
are	13
still	13
alive,	13
and	13
whom	13
God	13
has	13
been	13
pleased	13
to	13
preserve	13
that	13
they	13
may	13
enjoy	13
the	13
happiness	13
of	13
seeing	13
thee.	13
We	13
knew	13
long	13
since	13
that	13
thou	13
wert	13
in	13
Algiers,	13
and	13
from	13
the	13
appearance	13
of	13
thy	13
garments	13
and	13
those	13
of	13
all	13
this	13
company,	13
I	13
conclude	13
that	13
ye	13
have	13
had	13
a	13
miraculous	13
restoration	13
to	13
liberty.”	13
“It	13
is	13
true,”	13
replied	13
the	13
young	13
man,	13
“and	13
by-and-by	13
we	13
will	13
tell	13
you	13
all.”	13
As	13
soon	13
as	13
the	13
horsemen	13
understood	13
that	13
we	13
were	13
Christian	13
captives,	13
they	13
dismounted	13
from	13
their	13
horses,	13
and	13
each	13
offered	13
his	13
to	13
carry	13
us	13
to	13
the	13
city	13
of	13
Velez	13
Malaga,	13
which	13
was	13
a	13
league	13
and	13
a	13
half	13
distant.	13
Some	13
of	13
them	13
went	13
to	13
bring	13
the	13
boat	13
to	13
the	13
city,	13
we	13
having	13
told	13
them	13
where	13
we	13
had	13
left	13
it;	13
others	13
took	13
us	13
up	13
behind	13
them,	13
and	13
Zoraida	13
was	13
placed	13
on	13
the	13
horse	13
of	13
the	13
young	13
man’s	13
uncle.	13
The	13
whole	13
town	13
came	13
out	13
to	13
meet	13
us,	13
for	13
they	13
had	13
by	13
this	13
time	13
heard	13
of	13
our	13
arrival	13
from	13
one	13
who	13
had	13
gone	13
on	13
in	13
advance.	13
They	13
were	13
not	13
astonished	13
to	13
see	13
liberated	13
captives	13
or	13
captive	13
Moors,	13
for	13
people	13
on	13
that	13
coast	13
are	13
well	13
used	13
to	13
see	13
both	13
one	13
and	13
the	13
other;	13
but	13
they	13
were	13
astonished	13
at	13
the	13
beauty	13
of	13
Zoraida,	13
which	13
was	13
just	13
then	13
heightened,	13
as	13
well	13
by	13
the	13
exertion	13
of	13
travelling	13
as	13
by	13
joy	13
at	13
finding	13
herself	13
on	13
Christian	13
soil,	13
and	13
relieved	13
of	13
all	13
fear	13
of	13
being	13
lost;	13
for	13
this	13
had	13
brought	13
such	13
a	13
glow	13
upon	13
her	13
face,	13
that	13
unless	13
my	13
affection	13
for	13
her	13
were	13
deceiving	13
me,	13
I	13
would	13
venture	13
to	13
say	13
that	13
there	13
was	13
not	13
a	13
more	13
beautiful	13
creature	13
in	13
the	13
world—at	13
least,	13
that	13
I	13
had	13
ever	13
seen.	13
We	13
went	13
straight	13
to	13
the	13
church	13
to	13
return	13
thanks	13
to	13
God	13
for	13
the	13
mercies	13
we	13
had	13
received,	13
and	13
when	13
Zoraida	13
entered	13
it	13
she	13
said	13
there	13
were	13
faces	13
there	13
like	13
Lela	13
Marien’s.	13
We	13
told	13
her	13
they	13
were	13
her	13
images;	13
and	13
as	13
well	13
as	13
he	13
could	13
the	13
renegade	13
explained	13
to	13
her	13
what	13
they	13
meant,	13
that	13
she	13
might	13
adore	13
them	13
as	13
if	13
each	13
of	13
them	13
were	13
the	13
very	13
same	13
Lela	13
Marien	13
that	13
had	13
spoken	13
to	13
her;	13
and	13
she,	13
having	13
great	13
intelligence	13
and	13
a	13
quick	13
and	13
clear	13
instinct,	13
understood	13
at	13
once	13
all	13
he	13
said	13
to	13
her	13
about	13
them.	13
Thence	13
they	13
took	13
us	13
away	13
and	13
distributed	13
us	13
all	13
in	13
different	13
houses	13
in	13
the	13
town;	13
but	13
as	13
for	13
the	13
renegade,	13
Zoraida,	13
and	13
myself,	13
the	13
Christian	13
who	13
came	13
with	13
us	13
brought	13
us	13
to	13
the	13
house	13
of	13
his	13
parents,	13
who	13
had	13
a	13
fair	13
share	13
of	13
the	13
gifts	13
of	13
fortune,	13
and	13
treated	13
us	13
with	13
as	13
much	13
kindness	13
as	13
they	13
did	13
their	13
own	13
son.	13
We	13
remained	13
six	13
days	13
in	13
Velez,	13
at	13
the	13
end	13
of	13
which	13
the	13
renegade,	13
having	13
informed	13
himself	13
of	13
all	13
that	13
was	13
requisite	13
for	13
him	13
to	13
do,	13
set	13
out	13
for	13
the	13
city	13
of	13
Granada	13
to	13
restore	13
himself	13
to	13
the	13
sacred	13
bosom	13
of	13
the	13
Church	13
through	13
the	13
medium	13
of	13
the	13
Holy	13
Inquisition.	13
The	13
other	13
released	13
captives	13
took	13
their	13
departures,	13
each	13
the	13
way	13
that	13
seemed	13
best	13
to	13
him,	13
and	13
Zoraida	13
and	13
I	13
were	13
left	13
alone,	13
with	13
nothing	13
more	13
than	13
the	13
crowns	13
which	13
the	13
courtesy	13
of	13
the	13
Frenchman	13
had	13
bestowed	13
upon	13
Zoraida,	13
out	13
of	13
which	13
I	13
bought	13
the	13
beast	13
on	13
which	13
she	13
rides;	13
and,	13
I	13
for	13
the	13
present	13
attending	13
her	13
as	13
her	13
father	13
and	13
squire	13
and	13
not	13
as	13
her	13
husband,	13
we	13
are	13
now	13
going	13
to	13
ascertain	13
if	13
my	13
father	13
is	13
living,	13
or	13
if	13
any	13
of	13
my	13
brothers	13
has	13
had	13
better	13
fortune	13
than	13
mine	13
has	13
been;	13
though,	13
as	13
Heaven	13
has	13
made	13
me	13
the	13
companion	13
of	13
Zoraida,	13
I	13
think	13
no	13
other	13
lot	13
could	13
be	13
assigned	13
to	13
me,	13
however	13
happy,	13
that	13
I	13
would	13
rather	13
have.	13
The	13
patience	13
with	13
which	13
she	13
endures	13
the	13
hardships	13
that	13
poverty	13
brings	13
with	13
it,	13
and	13
the	13
eagerness	13
she	13
shows	13
to	13
become	13
a	13
Christian,	13
are	13
such	13
that	13
they	13
fill	13
me	13
with	13
admiration,	13
and	13
bind	13
me	13
to	13
serve	13
her	13
all	13
my	13
life;	13
though	13
the	13
happiness	13
I	13
feel	13
in	13
seeing	13
myself	13
hers,	13
and	13
her	13
mine,	13
is	13
disturbed	13
and	13
marred	13
by	13
not	13
knowing	13
whether	13
I	13
shall	13
find	13
any	13
corner	13
to	13
shelter	13
her	13
in	13
my	13
own	13
country,	13
or	13
whether	13
time	13
and	13
death	13
may	13
not	13
have	13
made	13
such	13
changes	13
in	13
the	13
fortunes	13
and	13
lives	13
of	13
my	13
father	13
and	13
brothers,	13
that	13
I	13
shall	13
hardly	13
find	13
anyone	13
who	13
knows	13
me,	13
if	13
they	13
are	13
not	13
alive.	13
I	13
have	13
no	13
more	13
of	13
my	13
story	13
to	13
tell	13
you,	13
gentlemen;	13
whether	13
it	13
be	13
an	13
interesting	13
or	13
a	13
curious	13
one	13
let	13
your	13
better	13
judgments	13
decide;	13
all	13
I	13
can	13
say	13
is	13
I	13
would	13
gladly	13
have	13
told	13
it	13
to	13
you	13
more	13
briefly;	13
although	13
my	13
fear	13
of	13
wearying	13
you	13
has	13
made	13
me	13
leave	13
out	13
more	13
than	13
one	13
circumstance.	13

With	13
these	13
words	13
the	13
captive	13
held	13
his	13
peace,	13
and	13
Don	13
Fernando	13
said	13
to	13
him,	13
“In	13
truth,	13
captain,	13
the	13
manner	13
in	13
which	13
you	13
have	13
related	13
this	13
remarkable	13
adventure	13
has	13
been	13
such	13
as	13
befitted	13
the	13
novelty	13
and	13
strangeness	13
of	13
the	13
matter.	13
The	13
whole	13
story	13
is	13
curious	13
and	13
uncommon,	13
and	13
abounds	13
with	13
incidents	13
that	13
fill	13
the	13
hearers	13
with	13
wonder	13
and	13
astonishment;	13
and	13
so	13
great	13
is	13
the	13
pleasure	13
we	13
have	13
found	13
in	13
listening	13
to	13
it	13
that	13
we	13
should	13
be	13
glad	13
if	13
it	13
were	13
to	13
begin	13
again,	13
even	13
though	13
to-morrow	13
were	13
to	13
find	13
us	13
still	13
occupied	13
with	13
the	13
same	13
tale.”	13
And	13
while	13
he	13
said	13
this	13
Cardenio	13
and	13
the	13
rest	13
of	13
them	13
offered	13
to	13
be	13
of	13
service	13
to	13
him	13
in	13
any	13
way	13
that	13
lay	13
in	13
their	13
power,	13
and	13
in	13
words	13
and	13
language	13
so	13
kindly	13
and	13
sincere	13
that	13
the	13
captain	13
was	13
much	13
gratified	13
by	13
their	13
good-will.	13
In	13
particular	13
Don	13
Fernando	13
offered,	13
if	13
he	13
would	13
go	13
back	13
with	13
him,	13
to	13
get	13
his	13
brother	13
the	13
marquis	13
to	13
become	13
godfather	13
at	13
the	13
baptism	13
of	13
Zoraida,	13
and	13
on	13
his	13
own	13
part	13
to	13
provide	13
him	13
with	13
the	13
means	13
of	13
making	13
his	13
appearance	13
in	13
his	13
own	13
country	13
with	13
the	13
credit	13
and	13
comfort	13
he	13
was	13
entitled	13
to.	13
For	13
all	13
this	13
the	13
captive	13
returned	13
thanks	13
very	13
courteously,	13
although	13
he	13
would	13
not	13
accept	13
any	13
of	13
their	13
generous	13
offers.	13
By	13
this	13
time	13
night	13
closed	13
in,	13
and	13
as	13
it	13
did,	13
there	13
came	13
up	13
to	13
the	13
inn	13
a	13
coach	13
attended	13
by	13
some	13
men	13
on	13
horseback,	13
who	13
demanded	13
accommodation;	13
to	13
which	13
the	13
landlady	13
replied	13
that	13
there	13
was	13
not	13
a	13
hand’s	13
breadth	13
of	13
the	13
whole	13
inn	13
unoccupied.	13
“Still,	13
for	13
all	13
that,”	13
said	13
one	13
of	13
those	13
who	13
had	13
entered	13
on	13
horseback,	13
“room	13
must	13
be	13
found	13
for	13
his	13
lordship	13
the	13
Judge	13
here.”	13
At	13
this	13
name	13
the	13
landlady	13
was	13
taken	13
aback,	13
and	13
said,	13
“Señor,	13
the	13
fact	13
is	13
I	13
have	13
no	13
beds;	13
but	13
if	13
his	13
lordship	13
the	13
Judge	13
carries	13
one	13
with	13
him,	13
as	13
no	13
doubt	13
he	13
does,	13
let	13
him	13
come	13
in	13
and	13
welcome;	13
for	13
my	13
husband	13
and	13
I	13
will	13
give	13
up	13
our	13
room	13
to	13
accommodate	13
his	13
worship.”	13
“Very	13
good,	13
so	13
be	13
it,”	13
said	13
the	13
squire;	13
but	13
in	13
the	13
meantime	13
a	13
man	13
had	13
got	13
out	13
of	13
the	13
coach	13
whose	13
dress	13
indicated	13
at	13
a	13
glance	13
the	13
office	13
and	13
post	13
he	13
held,	13
for	13
the	13
long	13
robe	13
with	13
ruffled	13
sleeves	13
that	13
he	13
wore	13
showed	13
that	13
he	13
was,	13
as	13
his	13
servant	13
said,	13
a	13
Judge	13
of	13
appeal.	13
He	13
led	13
by	13
the	13
hand	13
a	13
young	13
girl	13
in	13
a	13
travelling	13
dress,	13
apparently	13
about	13
sixteen	13
years	13
of	13
age,	13
and	13
of	13
such	13
a	13
high-bred	13
air,	13
so	13
beautiful	13
and	13
so	13
graceful,	13
that	13
all	13
were	13
filled	13
with	13
admiration	13
when	13
she	13
made	13
her	13
appearance,	13
and	13
but	13
for	13
having	13
seen	13
Dorothea,	13
Luscinda,	13
and	13
Zoraida,	13
who	13
were	13
there	13
in	13
the	13
inn,	13
they	13
would	13
have	13
fancied	13
that	13
a	13
beauty	13
like	13
that	13
of	13
this	13
maiden’s	13
would	13
have	13
been	13
hard	13
to	13
find.	13
Don	13
Quixote	13
was	13
present	13
at	13
the	13
entrance	13
of	13
the	13
Judge	13
with	13
the	13
young	13
lady,	13
and	13
as	13
soon	13
as	13
he	13
saw	13
him	13
he	13
said,	13
“Your	13
worship	13
may	13
with	13
confidence	13
enter	13
and	13
take	13
your	13
ease	13
in	13
this	13
castle;	13
for	13
though	13
the	13
accommodation	13
be	13
scanty	13
and	13
poor,	13
there	13
are	13
no	13
quarters	13
so	13
cramped	13
or	13
inconvenient	13
that	13
they	13
cannot	13
make	13
room	13
for	13
arms	13
and	13
letters;	13
above	13
all	13
if	13
arms	13
and	13
letters	13
have	13
beauty	13
for	13
a	13
guide	13
and	13
leader,	13
as	13
letters	13
represented	13
by	13
your	13
worship	13
have	13
in	13
this	13
fair	13
maiden,	13
to	13
whom	13
not	13
only	13
ought	13
castles	13
to	13
throw	13
themselves	13
open	13
and	13
yield	13
themselves	13
up,	13
but	13
rocks	13
should	13
rend	13
themselves	13
asunder	13
and	13
mountains	13
divide	13
and	13
bow	13
themselves	13
down	13
to	13
give	13
her	13
a	13
reception.	13
Enter,	13
your	13
worship,	13
I	13
say,	13
into	13
this	13
paradise,	13
for	13
here	13
you	13
will	13
find	13
stars	13
and	13
suns	13
to	13
accompany	13
the	13
heaven	13
your	13
worship	13
brings	13
with	13
you,	13
here	13
you	13
will	13
find	13
arms	13
in	13
their	13
supreme	13
excellence,	13
and	13
beauty	13
in	13
its	13
highest	13
perfection.”	13
The	13
Judge	13
was	13
struck	13
with	13
amazement	13
at	13
the	13
language	13
of	13
Don	13
Quixote,	13
whom	13
he	13
scrutinized	13
very	13
carefully,	13
no	13
less	13
astonished	13
by	13
his	13
figure	13
than	13
by	13
his	13
talk;	13
and	13
before	13
he	13
could	13
find	13
words	13
to	13
answer	13
him	13
he	13
had	13
a	13
fresh	13
surprise,	13
when	13
he	13
saw	13
opposite	13
to	13
him	13
Luscinda,	13
Dorothea,	13
and	13
Zoraida,	13
who,	13
having	13
heard	13
of	13
the	13
new	13
guests	13
and	13
of	13
the	13
beauty	13
of	13
the	13
young	13
lady,	13
had	13
come	13
to	13
see	13
her	13
and	13
welcome	13
her;	13
Don	13
Fernando,	13
Cardenio,	13
and	13
the	13
curate,	13
however,	13
greeted	13
him	13
in	13
a	13
more	13
intelligible	13
and	13
polished	13
style.	13
In	13
short,	13
the	13
Judge	13
made	13
his	13
entrance	13
in	13
a	13
state	13
of	13
bewilderment,	13
as	13
well	13
with	13
what	13
he	13
saw	13
as	13
what	13
he	13
heard,	13
and	13
the	13
fair	13
ladies	13
of	13
the	13
inn	13
gave	13
the	13
fair	13
damsel	13
a	13
cordial	13
welcome.	13
On	13
the	13
whole	13
he	13
could	13
perceive	13
that	13
all	13
who	13
were	13
there	13
were	13
people	13
of	13
quality;	13
but	13
with	13
the	13
figure,	13
countenance,	13
and	13
bearing	13
of	13
Don	13
Quixote	13
he	13
was	13
at	13
his	13
wits’	13
end;	13
and	13
all	13
civilities	13
having	13
been	13
exchanged,	13
and	13
the	13
accommodation	13
of	13
the	13
inn	13
inquired	13
into,	13
it	13
was	13
settled,	13
as	13
it	13
had	13
been	13
before	13
settled,	13
that	13
all	13
the	13
women	13
should	13
retire	13
to	13
the	13
garret	13
that	13
has	13
been	13
already	13
mentioned,	13
and	13
that	13
the	13
men	13
should	13
remain	13
outside	13
as	13
if	13
to	13
guard	13
them;	13
the	13
Judge,	13
therefore,	13
was	13
very	13
well	13
pleased	13
to	13
allow	13
his	13
daughter,	13
for	13
such	13
the	13
damsel	13
was,	13
to	13
go	13
with	13
the	13
ladies,	13
which	13
she	13
did	13
very	13
willingly;	13
and	13
with	13
part	13
of	13
the	13
host’s	13
narrow	13
bed	13
and	13
half	13
of	13
what	13
the	13
Judge	13
had	13
brought	13
with	13
him,	13
they	13
made	13
a	13
more	13
comfortable	13
arrangement	13
for	13
the	13
night	13
than	13
they	13
had	13
expected.	13
The	13
captive,	13
whose	13
heart	13
had	13
leaped	13
within	13
him	13
the	13
instant	13
he	13
saw	13
the	13
Judge,	13
telling	13
him	13
somehow	13
that	13
this	13
was	13
his	13
brother,	13
asked	13
one	13
of	13
the	13
servants	13
who	13
accompanied	13
him	13
what	13
his	13
name	13
was,	13
and	13
whether	13
he	13
knew	13
from	13
what	13
part	13
of	13
the	13
country	13
he	13
came.	13
The	13
servant	13
replied	13
that	13
he	13
was	13
called	13
the	13
Licentiate	13
Juan	13
Perez	13
de	13
Viedma,	13
and	13
that	13
he	13
had	13
heard	13
it	13
said	13
he	13
came	13
from	13
a	13
village	13
in	13
the	13
mountains	13
of	13
Leon.	13
From	13
this	13
statement,	13
and	13
what	13
he	13
himself	13
had	13
seen,	13
he	13
felt	13
convinced	13
that	13
this	13
was	13
his	13
brother	13
who	13
had	13
adopted	13
letters	13
by	13
his	13
father’s	13
advice;	13
and	13
excited	13
and	13
rejoiced,	13
he	13
called	13
Don	13
Fernando	13
and	13
Cardenio	13
and	13
the	13
curate	13
aside,	13
and	13
told	13
them	13
how	13
the	13
matter	13
stood,	13
assuring	13
them	13
that	13
the	13
judge	13
was	13
his	13
brother.	13
The	13
servant	13
had	13
further	13
informed	13
him	13
that	13
he	13
was	13
now	13
going	13
to	13
the	13
Indies	13
with	13
the	13
appointment	13
of	13
Judge	13
of	13
the	13
Supreme	13
Court	13
of	13
Mexico;	13
and	13
he	13
had	13
learned,	13
likewise,	13
that	13
the	13
young	13
lady	13
was	13
his	13
daughter,	13
whose	13
mother	13
had	13
died	13
in	13
giving	13
birth	13
to	13
her,	13
and	13
that	13
he	13
was	13
very	13
rich	13
in	13
consequence	13
of	13
the	13
dowry	13
left	13
to	13
him	13
with	13
the	13
daughter.	13
He	13
asked	13
their	13
advice	13
as	13
to	13
what	13
means	13
he	13
should	13
adopt	13
to	13
make	13
himself	13
known,	13
or	13
to	13
ascertain	13
beforehand	13
whether,	13
when	13
he	13
had	13
made	13
himself	13
known,	13
his	13
brother,	13
seeing	13
him	13
so	13
poor,	13
would	13
be	13
ashamed	13
of	13
him,	13
or	13
would	13
receive	13
him	13
with	13
a	13
warm	13
heart.	13
“Leave	13
it	13
to	13
me	13
to	13
find	13
out	13
that,”	13
said	13
the	13
curate;	13
“though	13
there	13
is	13
no	13
reason	13
for	13
supposing,	13
señor	13
captain,	13
that	13
you	13
will	13
not	13
be	13
kindly	13
received,	13
because	13
the	13
worth	13
and	13
wisdom	13
that	13
your	13
brother’s	13
bearing	13
shows	13
him	13
to	13
possess	13
do	13
not	13
make	13
it	13
likely	13
that	13
he	13
will	13
prove	13
haughty	13
or	13
insensible,	13
or	13
that	13
he	13
will	13
not	13
know	13
how	13
to	13
estimate	13
the	13
accidents	13
of	13
fortune	13
at	13
their	13
proper	13
value.”	13
“Still,”	13
said	13
the	13
captain,	13
“I	13
would	13
not	13
make	13
myself	13
known	13
abruptly,	13
but	13
in	13
some	13
indirect	13
way.”	13
“I	13
have	13
told	13
you	13
already,”	13
said	13
the	13
curate,	13
“that	13
I	13
will	13
manage	13
it	13
in	13
a	13
way	13
to	13
satisfy	13
us	13
all.”	13
By	13
this	13
time	13
supper	13
was	13
ready,	13
and	13
they	13
all	13
took	13
their	13
seats	13
at	13
the	13
table,	13
except	13
the	13
captive,	13
and	13
the	13
ladies,	13
who	13
supped	13
by	13
themselves	13
in	13
their	13
own	13
room.	13
In	13
the	13
middle	13
of	13
supper	13
the	13
curate	13
said:	13
“I	13
had	13
a	13
comrade	13
of	13
your	13
worship’s	13
name,	13
Señor	13
Judge,	13
in	13
Constantinople,	13
where	13
I	13
was	13
a	13
captive	13
for	13
several	13
years,	13
and	13
that	13
same	13
comrade	13
was	13
one	13
of	13
the	13
stoutest	13
soldiers	13
and	13
captains	13
in	13
the	13
whole	13
Spanish	13
infantry;	13
but	13
he	13
had	13
as	13
large	13
a	13
share	13
of	13
misfortune	13
as	13
he	13
had	13
of	13
gallantry	13
and	13
courage.”	13
“And	13
how	13
was	13
the	13
captain	13
called,	13
señor?”	13
asked	13
the	13
Judge.	13
“He	13
was	13
called	13
Ruy	13
Perez	13
de	13
Viedma,”	13
replied	13
the	13
curate,	13
“and	13
he	13
was	13
born	13
in	13
a	13
village	13
in	13
the	13
mountains	13
of	13
Leon;	13
and	13
he	13
mentioned	13
a	13
circumstance	13
connected	13
with	13
his	13
father	13
and	13
his	13
brothers	13
which,	13
had	13
it	13
not	13
been	13
told	13
me	13
by	13
so	13
truthful	13
a	13
man	13
as	13
he	13
was,	13
I	13
should	13
have	13
set	13
down	13
as	13
one	13
of	13
those	13
fables	13
the	13
old	13
women	13
tell	13
over	13
the	13
fire	13
in	13
winter;	13
for	13
he	13
said	13
his	13
father	13
had	13
divided	13
his	13
property	13
among	13
his	13
three	13
sons	13
and	13
had	13
addressed	13
words	13
of	13
advice	13
to	13
them	13
sounder	13
than	13
any	13
of	13
Cato’s.	13
But	13
I	13
can	13
say	13
this	13
much,	13
that	13
the	13
choice	13
he	13
made	13
of	13
going	13
to	13
the	13
wars	13
was	13
attended	13
with	13
such	13
success,	13
that	13
by	13
his	13
gallant	13
conduct	13
and	13
courage,	13
and	13
without	13
any	13
help	13
save	13
his	13
own	13
merit,	13
he	13
rose	13
in	13
a	13
few	13
years	13
to	13
be	13
captain	13
of	13
infantry,	13
and	13
to	13
see	13
himself	13
on	13
the	13
high-road	13
and	13
in	13
position	13
to	13
be	13
given	13
the	13
command	13
of	13
a	13
corps	13
before	13
long;	13
but	13
Fortune	13
was	13
against	13
him,	13
for	13
where	13
he	13
might	13
have	13
expected	13
her	13
favour	13
he	13
lost	13
it,	13
and	13
with	13
it	13
his	13
liberty,	13
on	13
that	13
glorious	13
day	13
when	13
so	13
many	13
recovered	13
theirs,	13
at	13
the	13
battle	13
of	13
Lepanto.	13
I	13
lost	13
mine	13
at	13
the	13
Goletta,	13
and	13
after	13
a	13
variety	13
of	13
adventures	13
we	13
found	13
ourselves	13
comrades	13
at	13
Constantinople.	13
Thence	13
he	13
went	13
to	13
Algiers,	13
where	13
he	13
met	13
with	13
one	13
of	13
the	13
most	13
extraordinary	13
adventures	13
that	13
ever	13
befell	13
anyone	13
in	13
the	13
world.”	13
Here	13
the	13
curate	13
went	13
on	13
to	13
relate	13
briefly	13
his	13
brother’s	13
adventure	13
with	13
Zoraida;	13
to	13
all	13
which	13
the	13
Judge	13
gave	13
such	13
an	13
attentive	13
hearing	13
that	13
he	13
never	13
before	13
had	13
been	13
so	13
much	13
of	13
a	13
hearer.	13
The	13
curate,	13
however,	13
only	13
went	13
so	13
far	13
as	13
to	13
describe	13
how	13
the	13
Frenchmen	13
plundered	13
those	13
who	13
were	13
in	13
the	13
boat,	13
and	13
the	13
poverty	13
and	13
distress	13
in	13
which	13
his	13
comrade	13
and	13
the	13
fair	13
Moor	13
were	13
left,	13
of	13
whom	13
he	13
said	13
he	13
had	13
not	13
been	13
able	13
to	13
learn	13
what	13
became	13
of	13
them,	13
or	13
whether	13
they	13
had	13
reached	13
Spain,	13
or	13
been	13
carried	13
to	13
France	13
by	13
the	13
Frenchmen.	13
The	13
captain,	13
standing	13
a	13
little	13
to	13
one	13
side,	13
was	13
listening	13
to	13
all	13
the	13
curate	13
said,	13
and	13
watching	13
every	13
movement	13
of	13
his	13
brother,	13
who,	13
as	13
soon	13
as	13
he	13
perceived	13
the	13
curate	13
had	13
made	13
an	13
end	13
of	13
his	13
story,	13
gave	13
a	13
deep	13
sigh	13
and	13
said	13
with	13
his	13
eyes	13
full	13
of	13
tears,	13
“Oh,	13
señor,	13
if	13
you	13
only	13
knew	13
what	13
news	13
you	13
have	13
given	13
me	13
and	13
how	13
it	13
comes	13
home	13
to	13
me,	13
making	13
me	13
show	13
how	13
I	13
feel	13
it	13
with	13
these	13
tears	13
that	13
spring	13
from	13
my	13
eyes	13
in	13
spite	13
of	13
all	13
my	13
worldly	13
wisdom	13
and	13
self-restraint!	13
That	13
brave	13
captain	13
that	13
you	13
speak	13
of	13
is	13
my	13
eldest	13
brother,	13
who,	13
being	13
of	13
a	13
bolder	13
and	13
loftier	13
mind	13
than	13
my	13
other	13
brother	13
or	13
myself,	13
chose	13
the	13
honourable	13
and	13
worthy	13
calling	13
of	13
arms,	13
which	13
was	13
one	13
of	13
the	13
three	13
careers	13
our	13
father	13
proposed	13
to	13
us,	13
as	13
your	13
comrade	13
mentioned	13
in	13
that	13
fable	13
you	13
thought	13
he	13
was	13
telling	13
you.	13
I	13
followed	13
that	13
of	13
letters,	13
in	13
which	13
God	13
and	13
my	13
own	13
exertions	13
have	13
raised	13
me	13
to	13
the	13
position	13
in	13
which	13
you	13
see	13
me.	13
My	13
second	13
brother	13
is	13
in	13
Peru,	13
so	13
wealthy	13
that	13
with	13
what	13
he	13
has	13
sent	13
to	13
my	13
father	13
and	13
to	13
me	13
he	13
has	13
fully	13
repaid	13
the	13
portion	13
he	13
took	13
with	13
him,	13
and	13
has	13
even	13
furnished	13
my	13
father’s	13
hands	13
with	13
the	13
means	13
of	13
gratifying	13
his	13
natural	13
generosity,	13
while	13
I	13
too	13
have	13
been	13
enabled	13
to	13
pursue	13
my	13
studies	13
in	13
a	13
more	13
becoming	13
and	13
creditable	13
fashion,	13
and	13
so	13
to	13
attain	13
my	13
present	13
standing.	13
My	13
father	13
is	13
still	13
alive,	13
though	13
dying	13
with	13
anxiety	13
to	13
hear	13
of	13
his	13
eldest	13
son,	13
and	13
he	13
prays	13
God	13
unceasingly	13
that	13
death	13
may	13
not	13
close	13
his	13
eyes	13
until	13
he	13
has	13
looked	13
upon	13
those	13
of	13
his	13
son;	13
but	13
with	13
regard	13
to	13
him	13
what	13
surprises	13
me	13
is,	13
that	13
having	13
so	13
much	13
common	13
sense	13
as	13
he	13
had,	13
he	13
should	13
have	13
neglected	13
to	13
give	13
any	13
intelligence	13
about	13
himself,	13
either	13
in	13
his	13
troubles	13
and	13
sufferings,	13
or	13
in	13
his	13
prosperity,	13
for	13
if	13
his	13
father	13
or	13
any	13
of	13
us	13
had	13
known	13
of	13
his	13
condition	13
he	13
need	13
not	13
have	13
waited	13
for	13
that	13
miracle	13
of	13
the	13
reed	13
to	13
obtain	13
his	13
ransom;	13
but	13
what	13
now	13
disquiets	13
me	13
is	13
the	13
uncertainty	13
whether	13
those	13
Frenchmen	13
may	13
have	13
restored	13
him	13
to	13
liberty,	13
or	13
murdered	13
him	13
to	13
hide	13
the	13
robbery.	13
All	13
this	13
will	13
make	13
me	13
continue	13
my	13
journey,	13
not	13
with	13
the	13
satisfaction	13
in	13
which	13
I	13
began	13
it,	13
but	13
in	13
the	13
deepest	13
melancholy	13
and	13
sadness.	13
Oh	13
dear	13
brother!	13
that	13
I	13
only	13
knew	13
where	13
thou	13
art	13
now,	13
and	13
I	13
would	13
hasten	13
to	13
seek	13
thee	13
out	13
and	13
deliver	13
thee	13
from	13
thy	13
sufferings,	13
though	13
it	13
were	13
to	13
cost	13
me	13
suffering	13
myself!	13
Oh	13
that	13
I	13
could	13
bring	13
news	13
to	13
our	13
old	13
father	13
that	13
thou	13
art	13
alive,	13
even	13
wert	13
thou	13
in	13
the	13
deepest	13
dungeon	13
of	13
Barbary;	13
for	13
his	13
wealth	13
and	13
my	13
brother’s	13
and	13
mine	13
would	13
rescue	13
thee	13
thence!	13
Oh	13
beautiful	13
and	13
generous	13
Zoraida,	13
that	13
I	13
could	13
repay	13
thy	13
goodness	13
to	13
a	13
brother!	13
That	13
I	13
could	13
be	13
present	13
at	13
the	13
new	13
birth	13
of	13
thy	13
soul,	13
and	13
at	13
thy	13
bridal	13
that	13
would	13
give	13
us	13
all	13
such	13
happiness!”	13
All	13
this	13
and	13
more	13
the	13
Judge	13
uttered	13
with	13
such	13
deep	13
emotion	13
at	13
the	13
news	13
he	13
had	13
received	13
of	13
his	13
brother	13
that	13
all	13
who	13
heard	13
him	13
shared	13
in	13
it,	13
showing	13
their	13
sympathy	13
with	13
his	13
sorrow.	13
The	13
curate,	13
seeing,	13
then,	13
how	13
well	13
he	13
had	13
succeeded	13
in	13
carrying	13
out	13
his	13
purpose	13
and	13
the	13
captain’s	13
wishes,	13
had	13
no	13
desire	13
to	13
keep	13
them	13
unhappy	13
any	13
longer,	13
so	13
he	13
rose	13
from	13
the	13
table	13
and	13
going	13
into	13
the	13
room	13
where	13
Zoraida	13
was	13
he	13
took	13
her	13
by	13
the	13
hand,	13
Luscinda,	13
Dorothea,	13
and	13
the	13
Judge’s	13
daughter	13
following	13
her.	13
The	13
captain	13
was	13
waiting	13
to	13
see	13
what	13
the	13
curate	13
would	13
do,	13
when	13
the	13
latter,	13
taking	13
him	13
with	13
the	13
other	13
hand,	13
advanced	13
with	13
both	13
of	13
them	13
to	13
where	13
the	13
Judge	13
and	13
the	13
other	13
gentlemen	13
were	13
and	13
said,	13
“Let	13
your	13
tears	13
cease	13
to	13
flow,	13
Señor	13
Judge,	13
and	13
the	13
wish	13
of	13
your	13
heart	13
be	13
gratified	13
as	13
fully	13
as	13
you	13
could	13
desire,	13
for	13
you	13
have	13
before	13
you	13
your	13
worthy	13
brother	13
and	13
your	13
good	13
sister-in-law.	13
He	13
whom	13
you	13
see	13
here	13
is	13
the	13
Captain	13
Viedma,	13
and	13
this	13
is	13
the	13
fair	13
Moor	13
who	13
has	13
been	13
so	13
good	13
to	13
him.	13
The	13
Frenchmen	13
I	13
told	13
you	13
of	13
have	13
reduced	13
them	13
to	13
the	13
state	13
of	13
poverty	13
you	13
see	13
that	13
you	13
may	13
show	13
the	13
generosity	13
of	13
your	13
kind	13
heart.”	13
The	13
captain	13
ran	13
to	13
embrace	13
his	13
brother,	13
who	13
placed	13
both	13
hands	13
on	13
his	13
breast	13
so	13
as	13
to	13
have	13
a	13
good	13
look	13
at	13
him,	13
holding	13
him	13
a	13
little	13
way	13
off	13
but	13
as	13
soon	13
as	13
he	13
had	13
fully	13
recognised	13
him	13
he	13
clasped	13
him	13
in	13
his	13
arms	13
so	13
closely,	13
shedding	13
such	13
tears	13
of	13
heartfelt	13
joy,	13
that	13
most	13
of	13
those	13
present	13
could	13
not	13
but	13
join	13
in	13
them.	13
The	13
words	13
the	13
brothers	13
exchanged,	13
the	13
emotion	13
they	13
showed	13
can	13
scarcely	13
be	13
imagined,	13
I	13
fancy,	13
much	13
less	13
put	13
down	13
in	13
writing.	13
They	13
told	13
each	13
other	13
in	13
a	13
few	13
words	13
the	13
events	13
of	13
their	13
lives;	13
they	13
showed	13
the	13
true	13
affection	13
of	13
brothers	13
in	13
all	13
its	13
strength;	13
then	13
the	13
judge	13
embraced	13
Zoraida,	13
putting	13
all	13
he	13
possessed	13
at	13
her	13
disposal;	13
then	13
he	13
made	13
his	13
daughter	13
embrace	13
her,	13
and	13
the	13
fair	13
Christian	13
and	13
the	13
lovely	13
Moor	13
drew	13
fresh	13
tears	13
from	13
every	13
eye.	13
And	13
there	13
was	13
Don	13
Quixote	13
observing	13
all	13
these	13
strange	13
proceedings	13
attentively	13
without	13
uttering	13
a	13
word,	13
and	13
attributing	13
the	13
whole	13
to	13
chimeras	13
of	13
knight-errantry.	13
Then	13
they	13
agreed	13
that	13
the	13
captain	13
and	13
Zoraida	13
should	13
return	13
with	13
his	13
brother	13
to	13
Seville,	13
and	13
send	13
news	13
to	13
his	13
father	13
of	13
his	13
having	13
been	13
delivered	13
and	13
found,	13
so	13
as	13
to	13
enable	13
him	13
to	13
come	13
and	13
be	13
present	13
at	13
the	13
marriage	13
and	13
baptism	13
of	13
Zoraida,	13
for	13
it	13
was	13
impossible	13
for	13
the	13
Judge	13
to	13
put	13
off	13
his	13
journey,	13
as	13
he	13
was	13
informed	13
that	13
in	13
a	13
month	13
from	13
that	13
time	13
the	13
fleet	13
was	13
to	13
sail	13
from	13
Seville	13
for	13
New	13
Spain,	13
and	13
to	13
miss	13
the	13
passage	13
would	13
have	13
been	13
a	13
great	13
inconvenience	13
to	13
him.	13
In	13
short,	13
everybody	13
was	13
well	13
pleased	13
and	13
glad	13
at	13
the	13
captive’s	13
good	13
fortune;	13
and	13
as	13
now	13
almost	13
two-thirds	13
of	13
the	13
night	13
were	13
past,	13
they	13
resolved	13
to	13
retire	13
to	13
rest	13
for	13
the	13
remainder	13
of	13
it.	13
Don	13
Quixote	13
offered	13
to	13
mount	13
guard	13
over	13
the	13
castle	13
lest	13
they	13
should	13
be	13
attacked	13
by	13
some	13
giant	13
or	13
other	13
malevolent	13
scoundrel,	13
covetous	13
of	13
the	13
great	13
treasure	13
of	13
beauty	13
the	13
castle	13
contained.	13
Those	13
who	13
understood	13
him	13
returned	13
him	13
thanks	13
for	13
this	13
service,	13
and	13
they	13
gave	13
the	13
Judge	13
an	13
account	13
of	13
his	13
extraordinary	13
humour,	13
with	13
which	13
he	13
was	13
not	13
a	13
little	13
amused.	13
Sancho	13
Panza	13
alone	13
was	13
fuming	13
at	13
the	13
lateness	13
of	13
the	13
hour	13
for	13
retiring	13
to	13
rest;	13
and	13
he	13
of	13
all	13
was	13
the	13
one	13
that	13
made	13
himself	13
most	13
comfortable,	13
as	13
he	13
stretched	13
himself	13
on	13
the	13
trappings	13
of	13
his	13
ass,	13
which,	13
as	13
will	13
be	13
told	13
farther	13
on,	13
cost	13
him	13
so	13
dear.	13
The	13
ladies,	13
then,	13
having	13
retired	13
to	13
their	13
chamber,	13
and	13
the	13
others	13
having	13
disposed	13
themselves	13
with	13
as	13
little	13
discomfort	13
as	13
they	13
could,	13
Don	13
Quixote	13
sallied	13
out	13
of	13
the	13
inn	13
to	13
act	13
as	13
sentinel	13
of	13
the	13
castle	13
as	13
he	13
had	13
promised.	13
It	13
happened,	13
however,	13
that	13
a	13
little	13
before	13
the	13
approach	13
of	13
dawn	13
a	13
voice	13
so	13
musical	13
and	13
sweet	13
reached	13
the	13
ears	13
of	13
the	13
ladies	13
that	13
it	13
forced	13
them	13
all	13
to	13
listen	13
attentively,	13
but	13
especially	13
Dorothea,	13
who	13
had	13
been	13
awake,	13
and	13
by	13
whose	13
side	13
Doña	13
Clara	13
de	13
Viedma,	13
for	13
so	13
the	13
Judge’s	13
daughter	13
was	13
called,	13
lay	13
sleeping.	13
No	13
one	13
could	13
imagine	13
who	13
it	13
was	13
that	13
sang	13
so	13
sweetly,	13
and	13
the	13
voice	13
was	13
unaccompanied	13
by	13
any	13
instrument.	13
At	13
one	13
moment	13
it	13
seemed	13
to	13
them	13
as	13
if	13
the	13
singer	13
were	13
in	13
the	13
courtyard,	13
at	13
another	13
in	13
the	13
stable;	13
and	13
as	13
they	13
were	13
all	13
attention,	13
wondering,	13
Cardenio	13
came	13
to	13
the	13
door	13
and	13
said,	13
“Listen,	13
whoever	13
is	13
not	13
asleep,	13
and	13
you	13
will	13
hear	13
a	13
muleteer’s	13
voice	13
that	13
enchants	13
as	13
it	13
chants.”	13
“We	13
are	13
listening	13
to	13
it	13
already,	13
señor,”	13
said	13
Dorothea;	13
on	13
which	13
Cardenio	13
went	13
away;	13
and	13
Dorothea,	13
giving	13
all	13
her	13
attention	13
to	13
it,	13
made	13
out	13
the	13
words	13
of	13
the	13
song	13
to	13
be	13
these:	13

Ah	13
me,	13
Love’s	13
mariner	13
am	13
I	13
On	13
Love’s	13
deep	13
ocean	13
sailing;	13
I	13
know	13
not	13
where	13
the	13
haven	13
lies,	13
I	13
dare	13
not	13
hope	13
to	13
gain	13
it.	13
One	13
solitary	13
distant	13
star	13
Is	13
all	13
I	13
have	13
to	13
guide	13
me,	13
A	13
brighter	13
orb	13
than	13
those	13
of	13
old	13
That	13
Palinurus	13
lighted.	13
And	13
vaguely	13
drifting	13
am	13
I	13
borne,	13
I	13
know	13
not	13
where	13
it	13
leads	13
me;	13
I	13
fix	13
my	13
gaze	13
on	13
it	13
alone,	13
Of	13
all	13
beside	13
it	13
heedless.	13
But	13
over-cautious	13
prudery,	13
And	13
coyness	13
cold	13
and	13
cruel,	13
When	13
most	13
I	13
need	13
it,	13
these,	13
like	13
clouds,	13
Its	13
longed-for	13
light	13
refuse	13
me.	13
Bright	13
star,	13
goal	13
of	13
my	13
yearning	13
eyes	13
As	13
thou	13
above	13
me	13
beamest,	13
When	13
thou	13
shalt	13
hide	13
thee	13
from	13
my	13
sight	13
I’ll	13
know	13
that	13
death	13
is	13
near	13
me.	13
The	13
singer	13
had	13
got	13
so	13
far	13
when	13
it	13
struck	13
Dorothea	13
that	13
it	13
was	13
not	13
fair	13
to	13
let	13
Clara	13
miss	13
hearing	13
such	13
a	13
sweet	13
voice,	13
so,	13
shaking	13
her	13
from	13
side	13
to	13
side,	13
she	13
woke	13
her,	13
saying:	13
“Forgive	13
me,	13
child,	13
for	13
waking	13
thee,	13
but	13
I	13
do	13
so	13
that	13
thou	13
mayest	13
have	13
the	13
pleasure	13
of	13
hearing	13
the	13
best	13
voice	13
thou	13
hast	13
ever	13
heard,	13
perhaps,	13
in	13
all	13
thy	13
life.”	13
Clara	13
awoke	13
quite	13
drowsy,	13
and	13
not	13
understanding	13
at	13
the	13
moment	13
what	13
Dorothea	13
said,	13
asked	13
her	13
what	13
it	13
was;	13
she	13
repeated	13
what	13
she	13
had	13
said,	13
and	13
Clara	13
became	13
attentive	13
at	13
once;	13
but	13
she	13
had	13
hardly	13
heard	13
two	13
lines,	13
as	13
the	13
singer	13
continued,	13
when	13
a	13
strange	13
trembling	13
seized	13
her,	13
as	13
if	13
she	13
were	13
suffering	13
from	13
a	13
severe	13
attack	13
of	13
quartan	13
ague,	13
and	13
throwing	13
her	13
arms	13
round	13
Dorothea	13
she	13
said:	13
“Ah,	13
dear	13
lady	13
of	13
my	13
soul	13
and	13
life!	13
why	13
did	13
you	13
wake	13
me?	13
The	13
greatest	13
kindness	13
fortune	13
could	13
do	13
me	13
now	13
would	13
be	13
to	13
close	13
my	13
eyes	13
and	13
ears	13
so	13
as	13
neither	13
to	13
see	13
or	13
hear	13
that	13
unhappy	13
musician.”	13
“What	13
art	13
thou	13
talking	13
about,	13
child?”	13
said	13
Dorothea.	13
“Why,	13
they	13
say	13
this	13
singer	13
is	13
a	13
muleteer!”	13
“Nay,	13
he	13
is	13
the	13
lord	13
of	13
many	13
places,”	13
replied	13
Clara,	13
“and	13
that	13
one	13
in	13
my	13
heart	13
which	13
he	13
holds	13
so	13
firmly	13
shall	13
never	13
be	13
taken	13
from	13
him,	13
unless	13
he	13
be	13
willing	13
to	13
surrender	13
it.”	13
Dorothea	13
was	13
amazed	13
at	13
the	13
ardent	13
language	13
of	13
the	13
girl,	13
for	13
it	13
seemed	13
to	13
be	13
far	13
beyond	13
such	13
experience	13
of	13
life	13
as	13
her	13
tender	13
years	13
gave	13
any	13
promise	13
of,	13
so	13
she	13
said	13
to	13
her:	13
“You	13
speak	13
in	13
such	13
a	13
way	13
that	13
I	13
cannot	13
understand	13
you,	13
Señora	13
Clara;	13
explain	13
yourself	13
more	13
clearly,	13
and	13
tell	13
me	13
what	13
is	13
this	13
you	13
are	13
saying	13
about	13
hearts	13
and	13
places	13
and	13
this	13
musician	13
whose	13
voice	13
has	13
so	13
moved	13
you?	13
But	13
do	13
not	13
tell	13
me	13
anything	13
now;	13
I	13
do	13
not	13
want	13
to	13
lose	13
the	13
pleasure	13
I	13
get	13
from	13
listening	13
to	13
the	13
singer	13
by	13
giving	13
my	13
attention	13
to	13
your	13
transports,	13
for	13
I	13
perceive	13
he	13
is	13
beginning	13
to	13
sing	13
a	13
new	13
strain	13
and	13
a	13
new	13
air.”	13
“Let	13
him,	13
in	13
Heaven’s	13
name,”	13
returned	13
Clara;	13
and	13
not	13
to	13
hear	13
him	13
she	13
stopped	13
both	13
ears	13
with	13
her	13
hands,	13
at	13
which	13
Dorothea	13
was	13
again	13
surprised;	13
but	13
turning	13
her	13
attention	13
to	13
the	13
song	13
she	13
found	13
that	13
it	13
ran	13
in	13
this	13
fashion:	13
Sweet	13
Hope,	13
my	13
stay,	13
That	13
onward	13
to	13
the	13
goal	13
of	13
thy	13
intent	13
Dost	13
make	13
thy	13
way,	13
Heedless	13
of	13
hindrance	13
or	13
impediment,	13
Have	13
thou	13
no	13
fear	13
If	13
at	13
each	13
step	13
thou	13
findest	13
death	13
is	13
near.	13
No	13
victory,	13
No	13
joy	13
of	13
triumph	13
doth	13
the	13
faint	13
heart	13
know;	13
Unblest	13
is	13
he	13
That	13
a	13
bold	13
front	13
to	13
Fortune	13
dares	13
not	13
show,	13
But	13
soul	13
and	13
sense	13
In	13
bondage	13
yieldeth	13
up	13
to	13
indolence.	13
If	13
Love	13
his	13
wares	13
Do	13
dearly	13
sell,	13
his	13
right	13
must	13
be	13
contest;	13
What	13
gold	13
compares	13
With	13
that	13
whereon	13
his	13
stamp	13
he	13
hath	13
imprest?	13
And	13
all	13
men	13
know	13
What	13
costeth	13
little	13
that	13
we	13
rate	13
but	13
low.	13
Love	13
resolute	13
Knows	13
not	13
the	13
word	13
“impossibility;”	13
And	13
though	13
my	13
suit	13
Beset	13
by	13
endless	13
obstacles	13
I	13
see,	13
Yet	13
no	13
despair	13
Shall	13
hold	13
me	13
bound	13
to	13
earth	13
while	13
heaven	13
is	13
there.	13
Here	13
the	13
voice	13
ceased	13
and	13
Clara’s	13
sobs	13
began	13
afresh,	13
all	13
which	13
excited	13
Dorothea’s	13
curiosity	13
to	13
know	13
what	13
could	13
be	13
the	13
cause	13
of	13
singing	13
so	13
sweet	13
and	13
weeping	13
so	13
bitter,	13
so	13
she	13
again	13
asked	13
her	13
what	13
it	13
was	13
she	13
was	13
going	13
to	13
say	13
before.	13
On	13
this	13
Clara,	13
afraid	13
that	13
Luscinda	13
might	13
overhear	13
her,	13
winding	13
her	13
arms	13
tightly	13
round	13
Dorothea	13
put	13
her	13
mouth	13
so	13
close	13
to	13
her	13
ear	13
that	13
she	13
could	13
speak	13
without	13
fear	13
of	13
being	13
heard	13
by	13
anyone	13
else,	13
and	13
said:	13
“This	13
singer,	13
dear	13
señora,	13
is	13
the	13
son	13
of	13
a	13
gentleman	13
of	13
Aragon,	13
lord	13
of	13
two	13
villages,	13
who	13
lives	13
opposite	13
my	13
father’s	13
house	13
at	13
Madrid;	13
and	13
though	13
my	13
father	13
had	13
curtains	13
to	13
the	13
windows	13
of	13
his	13
house	13
in	13
winter,	13
and	13
lattice-work	13
in	13
summer,	13
in	13
some	13
way—I	13
know	13
not	13
how—this	13
gentleman,	13
who	13
was	13
pursuing	13
his	13
studies,	13
saw	13
me,	13
whether	13
in	13
church	13
or	13
elsewhere,	13
I	13
cannot	13
tell,	13
and,	13
in	13
fact,	13
fell	13
in	13
love	13
with	13
me,	13
and	13
gave	13
me	13
to	13
know	13
it	13
from	13
the	13
windows	13
of	13
his	13
house,	13
with	13
so	13
many	13
signs	13
and	13
tears	13
that	13
I	13
was	13
forced	13
to	13
believe	13
him,	13
and	13
even	13
to	13
love	13
him,	13
without	13
knowing	13
what	13
it	13
was	13
he	13
wanted	13
of	13
me.	13
One	13
of	13
the	13
signs	13
he	13
used	13
to	13
make	13
me	13
was	13
to	13
link	13
one	13
hand	13
in	13
the	13
other,	13
to	13
show	13
me	13
he	13
wished	13
to	13
marry	13
me;	13
and	13
though	13
I	13
should	13
have	13
been	13
glad	13
if	13
that	13
could	13
be,	13
being	13
alone	13
and	13
motherless	13
I	13
knew	13
not	13
whom	13
to	13
open	13
my	13
mind	13
to,	13
and	13
so	13
I	13
left	13
it	13
as	13
it	13
was,	13
showing	13
him	13
no	13
favour,	13
except	13
when	13
my	13
father,	13
and	13
his	13
too,	13
were	13
from	13
home,	13
to	13
raise	13
the	13
curtain	13
or	13
the	13
lattice	13
a	13
little	13
and	13
let	13
him	13
see	13
me	13
plainly,	13
at	13
which	13
he	13
would	13
show	13
such	13
delight	13
that	13
he	13
seemed	13
as	13
if	13
he	13
were	13
going	13
mad.	13
Meanwhile	13
the	13
time	13
for	13
my	13
father’s	13
departure	13
arrived,	13
which	13
he	13
became	13
aware	13
of,	13
but	13
not	13
from	13
me,	13
for	13
I	13
had	13
never	13
been	13
able	13
to	13
tell	13
him	13
of	13
it.	13
He	13
fell	13
sick,	13
of	13
grief	13
I	13
believe,	13
and	13
so	13
the	13
day	13
we	13
were	13
going	13
away	13
I	13
could	13
not	13
see	13
him	13
to	13
take	13
farewell	13
of	13
him,	13
were	13
it	13
only	13
with	13
the	13
eyes.	13
But	13
after	13
we	13
had	13
been	13
two	13
days	13
on	13
the	13
road,	13
on	13
entering	13
the	13
posada	13
of	13
a	13
village	13
a	13
day’s	13
journey	13
from	13
this,	13
I	13
saw	13
him	13
at	13
the	13
inn	13
door	13
in	13
the	13
dress	13
of	13
a	13
muleteer,	13
and	13
so	13
well	13
disguised,	13
that	13
if	13
I	13
did	13
not	13
carry	13
his	13
image	13
graven	13
on	13
my	13
heart	13
it	13
would	13
have	13
been	13
impossible	13
for	13
me	13
to	13
recognise	13
him.	13
But	13
I	13
knew	13
him,	13
and	13
I	13
was	13
surprised,	13
and	13
glad;	13
he	13
watched	13
me,	13
unsuspected	13
by	13
my	13
father,	13
from	13
whom	13
he	13
always	13
hides	13
himself	13
when	13
he	13
crosses	13
my	13
path	13
on	13
the	13
road,	13
or	13
in	13
the	13
posadas	13
where	13
we	13
halt;	13
and,	13
as	13
I	13
know	13
what	13
he	13
is,	13
and	13
reflect	13
that	13
for	13
love	13
of	13
me	13
he	13
makes	13
this	13
journey	13
on	13
foot	13
in	13
all	13
this	13
hardship,	13
I	13
am	13
ready	13
to	13
die	13
of	13
sorrow;	13
and	13
where	13
he	13
sets	13
foot	13
there	13
I	13
set	13
my	13
eyes.	13
I	13
know	13
not	13
with	13
what	13
object	13
he	13
has	13
come;	13
or	13
how	13
he	13
could	13
have	13
got	13
away	13
from	13
his	13
father,	13
who	13
loves	13
him	13
beyond	13
measure,	13
having	13
no	13
other	13
heir,	13
and	13
because	13
he	13
deserves	13
it,	13
as	13
you	13
will	13
perceive	13
when	13
you	13
see	13
him.	13
And	13
moreover,	13
I	13
can	13
tell	13
you,	13
all	13
that	13
he	13
sings	13
is	13
out	13
of	13
his	13
own	13
head;	13
for	13
I	13
have	13
heard	13
them	13
say	13
he	13
is	13
a	13
great	13
scholar	13
and	13
poet;	13
and	13
what	13
is	13
more,	13
every	13
time	13
I	13
see	13
him	13
or	13
hear	13
him	13
sing	13
I	13
tremble	13
all	13
over,	13
and	13
am	13
terrified	13
lest	13
my	13
father	13
should	13
recognise	13
him	13
and	13
come	13
to	13
know	13
of	13
our	13
loves.	13
I	13
have	13
never	13
spoken	13
a	13
word	13
to	13
him	13
in	13
my	13
life;	13
and	13
for	13
all	13
that	13
I	13
love	13
him	13
so	13
that	13
I	13
could	13
not	13
live	13
without	13
him.	13
This,	13
dear	13
señora,	13
is	13
all	13
I	13
have	13
to	13
tell	13
you	13
about	13
the	13
musician	13
whose	13
voice	13
has	13
delighted	13
you	13
so	13
much;	13
and	13
from	13
it	13
alone	13
you	13
might	13
easily	13
perceive	13
he	13
is	13
no	13
muleteer,	13
but	13
a	13
lord	13
of	13
hearts	13
and	13
towns,	13
as	13
I	13
told	13
you	13
already.”	13
“Say	13
no	13
more,	13
Doña	13
Clara,”	13
said	13
Dorothea	13
at	13
this,	13
at	13
the	13
same	13
time	13
kissing	13
her	13
a	13
thousand	13
times	13
over,	13
“say	13
no	13
more,	13
I	13
tell	13
you,	13
but	13
wait	13
till	13
day	13
comes;	13
when	13
I	13
trust	13
in	13
God	13
to	13
arrange	13
this	13
affair	13
of	13
yours	13
so	13
that	13
it	13
may	13
have	13
the	13
happy	13
ending	13
such	13
an	13
innocent	13
beginning	13
deserves.”	13
“Ah,	13
señora,”	13
said	13
Doña	13
Clara,	13
“what	13
end	13
can	13
be	13
hoped	13
for	13
when	13
his	13
father	13
is	13
of	13
such	13
lofty	13
position,	13
and	13
so	13
wealthy,	13
that	13
he	13
would	13
think	13
I	13
was	13
not	13
fit	13
to	13
be	13
even	13
a	13
servant	13
to	13
his	13
son,	13
much	13
less	13
wife?	13
And	13
as	13
to	13
marrying	13
without	13
the	13
knowledge	13
of	13
my	13
father,	13
I	13
would	13
not	13
do	13
it	13
for	13
all	13
the	13
world.	13
I	13
would	13
not	13
ask	13
anything	13
more	13
than	13
that	13
this	13
youth	13
should	13
go	13
back	13
and	13
leave	13
me;	13
perhaps	13
with	13
not	13
seeing	13
him,	13
and	13
the	13
long	13
distance	13
we	13
shall	13
have	13
to	13
travel,	13
the	13
pain	13
I	13
suffer	13
now	13
may	13
become	13
easier;	13
though	13
I	13
daresay	13
the	13
remedy	13
I	13
propose	13
will	13
do	13
me	13
very	13
little	13
good.	13
I	13
don’t	13
know	13
how	13
the	13
devil	13
this	13
has	13
come	13
about,	13
or	13
how	13
this	13
love	13
I	13
have	13
for	13
him	13
got	13
in;	13
I	13
such	13
a	13
young	13
girl,	13
and	13
he	13
such	13
a	13
mere	13
boy;	13
for	13
I	13
verily	13
believe	13
we	13
are	13
both	13
of	13
an	13
age,	13
and	13
I	13
am	13
not	13
sixteen	13
yet;	13
for	13
I	13
will	13
be	13
sixteen	13
Michaelmas	13
Day,	13
next,	13
my	13
father	13
says.”	13
Dorothea	13
could	13
not	13
help	13
laughing	13
to	13
hear	13
how	13
like	13
a	13
child	13
Doña	13
Clara	13
spoke.	13
“Let	13
us	13
go	13
to	13
sleep	13
now,	13
señora,”	13
said	13
she,	13
“for	13
the	13
little	13
of	13
the	13
night	13
that	13
I	13
fancy	13
is	13
left	13
to	13
us:	13
God	13
will	13
soon	13
send	13
us	13
daylight,	13
and	13
we	13
will	13
set	13
all	13
to	13
rights,	13
or	13
it	13
will	13
go	13
hard	13
with	13
me.”	13
With	13
this	13
they	13
fell	13
asleep,	13
and	13
deep	13
silence	13
reigned	13
all	13
through	13
the	13
inn.	13
The	13
only	13
persons	13
not	13
asleep	13
were	13
the	13
landlady’s	13
daughter	13
and	13
her	13
servant	13
Maritornes,	13
who,	13
knowing	13
the	13
weak	13
point	13
of	13
Don	13
Quixote’s	13
humour,	13
and	13
that	13
he	13
was	13
outside	13
the	13
inn	13
mounting	13
guard	13
in	13
armour	13
and	13
on	13
horseback,	13
resolved,	13
the	13
pair	13
of	13
them,	13
to	13
play	13
some	13
trick	13
upon	13
him,	13
or	13
at	13
any	13
rate	13
to	13
amuse	13
themselves	13
for	13
a	13
while	13
by	13
listening	13
to	13
his	13
nonsense.	13
As	13
it	13
so	13
happened	13
there	13
was	13
not	13
a	13
window	13
in	13
the	13
whole	13
inn	13
that	13
looked	13
outwards	13
except	13
a	13
hole	13
in	13
the	13
wall	13
of	13
a	13
straw-loft	13
through	13
which	13
they	13
used	13
to	13
throw	13
out	13
the	13
straw.	13
At	13
this	13
hole	13
the	13
two	13
demi-damsels	13
posted	13
themselves,	13
and	13
observed	13
Don	13
Quixote	13
on	13
his	13
horse,	13
leaning	13
on	13
his	13
pike	13
and	13
from	13
time	13
to	13
time	13
sending	13
forth	13
such	13
deep	13
and	13
doleful	13
sighs,	13
that	13
he	13
seemed	13
to	13
pluck	13
up	13
his	13
soul	13
by	13
the	13
roots	13
with	13
each	13
of	13
them;	13
and	13
they	13
could	13
hear	13
him,	13
too,	13
saying	13
in	13
a	13
soft,	13
tender,	13
loving	13
tone,	13
“Oh	13
my	13
lady	13
Dulcinea	13
del	13
Toboso,	13
perfection	13
of	13
all	13
beauty,	13
summit	13
and	13
crown	13
of	13
discretion,	13
treasure	13
house	13
of	13
grace,	13
depositary	13
of	13
virtue,	13
and	13
finally,	13
ideal	13
of	13
all	13
that	13
is	13
good,	13
honourable,	13
and	13
delectable	13
in	13
this	13
world!	13
What	13
is	13
thy	13
grace	13
doing	13
now?	13
Art	13
thou,	13
perchance,	13
mindful	13
of	13
thy	13
enslaved	13
knight	13
who	13
of	13
his	13
own	13
free	13
will	13
hath	13
exposed	13
himself	13
to	13
so	13
great	13
perils,	13
and	13
all	13
to	13
serve	13
thee?	13
Give	13
me	13
tidings	13
of	13
her,	13
oh	13
luminary	13
of	13
the	13
three	13
faces!	13
Perhaps	13
at	13
this	13
moment,	13
envious	13
of	13
hers,	13
thou	13
art	13
regarding	13
her,	13
either	13
as	13
she	13
paces	13
to	13
and	13
fro	13
some	13
gallery	13
of	13
her	13
sumptuous	13
palaces,	13
or	13
leans	13
over	13
some	13
balcony,	13
meditating	13
how,	13
whilst	13
preserving	13
her	13
purity	13
and	13
greatness,	13
she	13
may	13
mitigate	13
the	13
tortures	13
this	13
wretched	13
heart	13
of	13
mine	13
endures	13
for	13
her	13
sake,	13
what	13
glory	13
should	13
recompense	13
my	13
sufferings,	13
what	13
repose	13
my	13
toil,	13
and	13
lastly	13
what	13
death	13
my	13
life,	13
and	13
what	13
reward	13
my	13
services?	13
And	13
thou,	13
oh	13
sun,	13
that	13
art	13
now	13
doubtless	13
harnessing	13
thy	13
steeds	13
in	13
haste	13
to	13
rise	13
betimes	13
and	13
come	13
forth	13
to	13
see	13
my	13
lady;	13
when	13
thou	13
seest	13
her	13
I	13
entreat	13
of	13
thee	13
to	13
salute	13
her	13
on	13
my	13
behalf:	13
but	13
have	13
a	13
care,	13
when	13
thou	13
shalt	13
see	13
her	13
and	13
salute	13
her,	13
that	13
thou	13
kiss	13
not	13
her	13
face;	13
for	13
I	13
shall	13
be	13
more	13
jealous	13
of	13
thee	13
than	13
thou	13
wert	13
of	13
that	13
light-footed	13
ingrate	13
that	13
made	13
thee	13
sweat	13
and	13
run	13
so	13
on	13
the	13
plains	13
of	13
Thessaly,	13
or	13
on	13
the	13
banks	13
of	13
the	13
Peneus	13
(for	13
I	13
do	13
not	13
exactly	13
recollect	13
where	13
it	13
was	13
thou	13
didst	13
run	13
on	13
that	13
occasion)	13
in	13
thy	13
jealousy	13
and	13
love.”	13
Don	13
Quixote	13
had	13
got	13
so	13
far	13
in	13
his	13
pathetic	13
speech	13
when	13
the	13
landlady’s	13
daughter	13
began	13
to	13
signal	13
to	13
him,	13
saying,	13
“Señor,	13
come	13
over	13
here,	13
please.”	13
At	13
these	13
signals	13
and	13
voice	13
Don	13
Quixote	13
turned	13
his	13
head	13
and	13
saw	13
by	13
the	13
light	13
of	13
the	13
moon,	13
which	13
then	13
was	13
in	13
its	13
full	13
splendour,	13
that	13
someone	13
was	13
calling	13
to	13
him	13
from	13
the	13
hole	13
in	13
the	13
wall,	13
which	13
seemed	13
to	13
him	13
to	13
be	13
a	13
window,	13
and	13
what	13
is	13
more,	13
with	13
a	13
gilt	13
grating,	13
as	13
rich	13
castles,	13
such	13
as	13
he	13
believed	13
the	13
inn	13
to	13
be,	13
ought	13
to	13
have;	13
and	13
it	13
immediately	13
suggested	13
itself	13
to	13
his	13
imagination	13
that,	13
as	13
on	13
the	13
former	13
occasion,	13
the	13
fair	13
damsel,	13
the	13
daughter	13
of	13
the	13
lady	13
of	13
the	13
castle,	13
overcome	13
by	13
love	13
for	13
him,	13
was	13
once	13
more	13
endeavouring	13
to	13
win	13
his	13
affections;	13
and	13
with	13
this	13
idea,	13
not	13
to	13
show	13
himself	13
discourteous,	13
or	13
ungrateful,	13
he	13
turned	13
Rocinante’s	13
head	13
and	13
approached	13
the	13
hole,	13
and	13
as	13
he	13
perceived	13
the	13
two	13
wenches	13
he	13
said:	13
“I	13
pity	13
you,	13
beauteous	13
lady,	13
that	13
you	13
should	13
have	13
directed	13
your	13
thoughts	13
of	13
love	13
to	13
a	13
quarter	13
from	13
whence	13
it	13
is	13
impossible	13
that	13
such	13
a	13
return	13
can	13
be	13
made	13
to	13
you	13
as	13
is	13
due	13
to	13
your	13
great	13
merit	13
and	13
gentle	13
birth,	13
for	13
which	13
you	13
must	13
not	13
blame	13
this	13
unhappy	13
knight-errant	13
whom	13
love	13
renders	13
incapable	13
of	13
submission	13
to	13
any	13
other	13
than	13
her	13
whom,	13
the	13
first	13
moment	13
his	13
eyes	13
beheld	13
her,	13
he	13
made	13
absolute	13
mistress	13
of	13
his	13
soul.	13
Forgive	13
me,	13
noble	13
lady,	13
and	13
retire	13
to	13
your	13
apartment,	13
and	13
do	13
not,	13
by	13
any	13
further	13
declaration	13
of	13
your	13
passion,	13
compel	13
me	13
to	13
show	13
myself	13
more	13
ungrateful;	13
and	13
if,	13
of	13
the	13
love	13
you	13
bear	13
me,	13
you	13
should	13
find	13
that	13
there	13
is	13
anything	13
else	13
in	13
my	13
power	13
wherein	13
I	13
can	13
gratify	13
you,	13
provided	13
it	13
be	13
not	13
love	13
itself,	13
demand	13
it	13
of	13
me;	13
for	13
I	13
swear	13
to	13
you	13
by	13
that	13
sweet	13
absent	13
enemy	13
of	13
mine	13
to	13
grant	13
it	13
this	13
instant,	13
though	13
it	13
be	13
that	13
you	13
require	13
of	13
me	13
a	13
lock	13
of	13
Medusa’s	13
hair,	13
which	13
was	13
all	13
snakes,	13
or	13
even	13
the	13
very	13
beams	13
of	13
the	13
sun	13
shut	13
up	13
in	13
a	13
vial.”	13
“My	13
mistress	13
wants	13
nothing	13
of	13
that	13
sort,	13
sir	13
knight,”	13
said	13
Maritornes	13
at	13
this.	13
“What	13
then,	13
discreet	13
dame,	13
is	13
it	13
that	13
your	13
mistress	13
wants?”	13
replied	13
Don	13
Quixote.	13
“Only	13
one	13
of	13
your	13
fair	13
hands,”	13
said	13
Maritornes,	13
“to	13
enable	13
her	13
to	13
vent	13
over	13
it	13
the	13
great	13
passion,	13
passion	13
which	13
has	13
brought	13
her	13
to	13
this	13
loophole,	13
so	13
much	13
to	13
the	13
risk	13
of	13
her	13
honour;	13
for	13
if	13
the	13
lord	13
her	13
father	13
had	13
heard	13
her,	13
the	13
least	13
slice	13
he	13
would	13
cut	13
off	13
her	13
would	13
be	13
her	13
ear.”	13
“I	13
should	13
like	13
to	13
see	13
that	13
tried,”	13
said	13
Don	13
Quixote;	13
“but	13
he	13
had	13
better	13
beware	13
of	13
that,	13
if	13
he	13
does	13
not	13
want	13
to	13
meet	13
the	13
most	13
disastrous	13
end	13
that	13
ever	13
father	13
in	13
the	13
world	13
met	13
for	13
having	13
laid	13
hands	13
on	13
the	13
tender	13
limbs	13
of	13
a	13
love-stricken	13
daughter.”	13
Maritornes	13
felt	13
sure	13
that	13
Don	13
Quixote	13
would	13
present	13
the	13
hand	13
she	13
had	13
asked,	13
and	13
making	13
up	13
her	13
mind	13
what	13
to	13
do,	13
she	13
got	13
down	13
from	13
the	13
hole	13
and	13
went	13
into	13
the	13
stable,	13
where	13
she	13
took	13
the	13
halter	13
of	13
Sancho	13
Panza’s	13
ass,	13
and	13
in	13
all	13
haste	13
returned	13
to	13
the	13
hole,	13
just	13
as	13
Don	13
Quixote	13
had	13
planted	13
himself	13
standing	13
on	13
Rocinante’s	13
saddle	13
in	13
order	13
to	13
reach	13
the	13
grated	13
window	13
where	13
he	13
supposed	13
the	13
lovelorn	13
damsel	13
to	13
be;	13
and	13
giving	13
her	13
his	13
hand,	13
he	13
said,	13
“Lady,	13
take	13
this	13
hand,	13
or	13
rather	13
this	13
scourge	13
of	13
the	13
evil-doers	13
of	13
the	13
earth;	13
take,	13
I	13
say,	13
this	13
hand	13
which	13
no	13
other	13
hand	13
of	13
woman	13
has	13
ever	13
touched,	13
not	13
even	13
hers	13
who	13
has	13
complete	13
possession	13
of	13
my	13
entire	13
body.	13
I	13
present	13
it	13
to	13
you,	13
not	13
that	13
you	13
may	13
kiss	13
it,	13
but	13
that	13
you	13
may	13
observe	13
the	13
contexture	13
of	13
the	13
sinews,	13
the	13
close	13
network	13
of	13
the	13
muscles,	13
the	13
breadth	13
and	13
capacity	13
of	13
the	13
veins,	13
whence	13
you	13
may	13
infer	13
what	13
must	13
be	13
the	13
strength	13
of	13
the	13
arm	13
that	13
has	13
such	13
a	13
hand.”	13
“That	13
we	13
shall	13
see	13
presently,”	13
said	13
Maritornes,	13
and	13
making	13
a	13
running	13
knot	13
on	13
the	13
halter,	13
she	13
passed	13
it	13
over	13
his	13
wrist	13
and	13
coming	13
down	13
from	13
the	13
hole	13
tied	13
the	13
other	13
end	13
very	13
firmly	13
to	13
the	13
bolt	13
of	13
the	13
door	13
of	13
the	13
straw-loft.	13
Don	13
Quixote,	13
feeling	13
the	13
roughness	13
of	13
the	13
rope	13
on	13
his	13
wrist,	13
exclaimed,	13
“Your	13
grace	13
seems	13
to	13
be	13
grating	13
rather	13
than	13
caressing	13
my	13
hand;	13
treat	13
it	13
not	13
so	13
harshly,	13
for	13
it	13
is	13
not	13
to	13
blame	13
for	13
the	13
offence	13
my	13
resolution	13
has	13
given	13
you,	13
nor	13
is	13
it	13
just	13
to	13
wreak	13
all	13
your	13
vengeance	13
on	13
so	13
small	13
a	13
part;	13
remember	13
that	13
one	13
who	13
loves	13
so	13
well	13
should	13
not	13
revenge	13
herself	13
so	13
cruelly.”	13
But	13
there	13
was	13
nobody	13
now	13
to	13
listen	13
to	13
these	13
words	13
of	13
Don	13
Quixote’s,	13
for	13
as	13
soon	13
as	13
Maritornes	13
had	13
tied	13
him	13
she	13
and	13
the	13
other	13
made	13
off,	13
ready	13
to	13
die	13
with	13
laughing,	13
leaving	13
him	13
fastened	13
in	13
such	13
a	13
way	13
that	13
it	13
was	13
impossible	13
for	13
him	13
to	13
release	13
himself.	13
He	13
was,	13
as	13
has	13
been	13
said,	13
standing	13
on	13
Rocinante,	13
with	13
his	13
arm	13
passed	13
through	13
the	13
hole	13
and	13
his	13
wrist	13
tied	13
to	13
the	13
bolt	13
of	13
the	13
door,	13
and	13
in	13
mighty	13
fear	13
and	13
dread	13
of	13
being	13
left	13
hanging	13
by	13
the	13
arm	13
if	13
Rocinante	13
were	13
to	13
stir	13
one	13
side	13
or	13
the	13
other;	13
so	13
he	13
did	13
not	13
dare	13
to	13
make	13
the	13
least	13
movement,	13
although	13
from	13
the	13
patience	13
and	13
imperturbable	13
disposition	13
of	13
Rocinante,	13
he	13
had	13
good	13
reason	13
to	13
expect	13
that	13
he	13
would	13
stand	13
without	13
budging	13
for	13
a	13
whole	13
century.	13
Finding	13
himself	13
fast,	13
then,	13
and	13
that	13
the	13
ladies	13
had	13
retired,	13
he	13
began	13
to	13
fancy	13
that	13
all	13
this	13
was	13
done	13
by	13
enchantment,	13
as	13
on	13
the	13
former	13
occasion	13
when	13
in	13
that	13
same	13
castle	13
that	13
enchanted	13
Moor	13
of	13
a	13
carrier	13
had	13
belaboured	13
him;	13
and	13
he	13
cursed	13
in	13
his	13
heart	13
his	13
own	13
want	13
of	13
sense	13
and	13
judgment	13
in	13
venturing	13
to	13
enter	13
the	13
castle	13
again,	13
after	13
having	13
come	13
off	13
so	13
badly	13
the	13
first	13
time;	13
it	13
being	13
a	13
settled	13
point	13
with	13
knights-errant	13
that	13
when	13
they	13
have	13
tried	13
an	13
adventure,	13
and	13
have	13
not	13
succeeded	13
in	13
it,	13
it	13
is	13
a	13
sign	13
that	13
it	13
is	13
not	13
reserved	13
for	13
them	13
but	13
for	13
others,	13
and	13
that	13
therefore	13
they	13
need	13
not	13
try	13
it	13
again.	13
Nevertheless	13
he	13
pulled	13
his	13
arm	13
to	13
see	13
if	13
he	13
could	13
release	13
himself,	13
but	13
it	13
had	13
been	13
made	13
so	13
fast	13
that	13
all	13
his	13
efforts	13
were	13
in	13
vain.	13
It	13
is	13
true	13
he	13
pulled	13
it	13
gently	13
lest	13
Rocinante	13
should	13
move,	13
but	13
try	13
as	13
he	13
might	13
to	13
seat	13
himself	13
in	13
the	13
saddle,	13
he	13
had	13
nothing	13
for	13
it	13
but	13
to	13
stand	13
upright	13
or	13
pull	13
his	13
hand	13
off.	13
Then	13
it	13
was	13
he	13
wished	13
for	13
the	13
sword	13
of	13
Amadis,	13
against	13
which	13
no	13
enchantment	13
whatever	13
had	13
any	13
power;	13
then	13
he	13
cursed	13
his	13
ill	13
fortune;	13
then	13
he	13
magnified	13
the	13
loss	13
the	13
world	13
would	13
sustain	13
by	13
his	13
absence	13
while	13
he	13
remained	13
there	13
enchanted,	13
for	13
that	13
he	13
believed	13
he	13
was	13
beyond	13
all	13
doubt;	13
then	13
he	13
once	13
more	13
took	13
to	13
thinking	13
of	13
his	13
beloved	13
Dulcinea	13
del	13
Toboso;	13
then	13
he	13
called	13
to	13
his	13
worthy	13
squire	13
Sancho	13
Panza,	13
who,	13
buried	13
in	13
sleep	13
and	13
stretched	13
upon	13
the	13
pack-saddle	13
of	13
his	13
ass,	13
was	13
oblivious,	13
at	13
that	13
moment,	13
of	13
the	13
mother	13
that	13
bore	13
him;	13
then	13
he	13
called	13
upon	13
the	13
sages	13
Lirgandeo	13
and	13
Alquife	13
to	13
come	13
to	13
his	13
aid;	13
then	13
he	13
invoked	13
his	13
good	13
friend	13
Urganda	13
to	13
succour	13
him;	13
and	13
then,	13
at	13
last,	13
morning	13
found	13
him	13
in	13
such	13
a	13
state	13
of	13
desperation	13
and	13
perplexity	13
that	13
he	13
was	13
bellowing	13
like	13
a	13
bull,	13
for	13
he	13
had	13
no	13
hope	13
that	13
day	13
would	13
bring	13
any	13
relief	13
to	13
his	13
suffering,	13
which	13
he	13
believed	13
would	13
last	13
for	13
ever,	13
inasmuch	13
as	13
he	13
was	13
enchanted;	13
and	13
of	13
this	13
he	13
was	13
convinced	13
by	13
seeing	13
that	13
Rocinante	13
never	13
stirred,	13
much	13
or	13
little,	13
and	13
he	13
felt	13
persuaded	13
that	13
he	13
and	13
his	13
horse	13
were	13
to	13
remain	13
in	13
this	13
state,	13
without	13
eating	13
or	13
drinking	13
or	13
sleeping,	13
until	13
the	13
malign	13
influence	13
of	13
the	13
stars	13
was	13
overpast,	13
or	13
until	13
some	13
other	13
more	13
sage	13
enchanter	13
should	13
disenchant	13
him.	13
But	13
he	13
was	13
very	13
much	13
deceived	13
in	13
this	13
conclusion,	13
for	13
daylight	13
had	13
hardly	13
begun	13
to	13
appear	13
when	13
there	13
came	13
up	13
to	13
the	13
inn	13
four	13
men	13
on	13
horseback,	13
well	13
equipped	13
and	13
accoutred,	13
with	13
firelocks	13
across	13
their	13
saddle-bows.	13
They	13
called	13
out	13
and	13
knocked	13
loudly	13
at	13
the	13
gate	13
of	13
the	13
inn,	13
which	13
was	13
still	13
shut;	13
on	13
seeing	13
which,	13
Don	13
Quixote,	13
even	13
there	13
where	13
he	13
was,	13
did	13
not	13
forget	13
to	13
act	13
as	13
sentinel,	13
and	13
said	13
in	13
a	13
loud	13
and	13
imperious	13
tone,	13
“Knights,	13
or	13
squires,	13
or	13
whatever	13
ye	13
be,	13
ye	13
have	13
no	13
right	13
to	13
knock	13
at	13
the	13
gates	13
of	13
this	13
castle;	13
for	13
it	13
is	13
plain	13
enough	13
that	13
they	13
who	13
are	13
within	13
are	13
either	13
asleep,	13
or	13
else	13
are	13
not	13
in	13
the	13
habit	13
of	13
throwing	13
open	13
the	13
fortress	13
until	13
the	13
sun’s	13
rays	13
are	13
spread	13
over	13
the	13
whole	13
surface	13
of	13
the	13
earth.	13
Withdraw	13
to	13
a	13
distance,	13
and	13
wait	13
till	13
it	13
is	13
broad	13
daylight,	13
and	13
then	13
we	13
shall	13
see	13
whether	13
it	13
will	13
be	13
proper	13
or	13
not	13
to	13
open	13
to	13
you.”	13
“What	13
the	13
devil	13
fortress	13
or	13
castle	13
is	13
this,”	13
said	13
one,	13
“to	13
make	13
us	13
stand	13
on	13
such	13
ceremony?	13
If	13
you	13
are	13
the	13
innkeeper	13
bid	13
them	13
open	13
to	13
us;	13
we	13
are	13
travellers	13
who	13
only	13
want	13
to	13
feed	13
our	13
horses	13
and	13
go	13
on,	13
for	13
we	13
are	13
in	13
haste.”	13
“Do	13
you	13
think,	13
gentlemen,	13
that	13
I	13
look	13
like	13
an	13
innkeeper?”	13
said	13
Don	13
Quixote.	13
“I	13
don’t	13
know	13
what	13
you	13
look	13
like,”	13
replied	13
the	13
other;	13
“but	13
I	13
know	13
that	13
you	13
are	13
talking	13
nonsense	13
when	13
you	13
call	13
this	13
inn	13
a	13
castle.”	13
“A	13
castle	13
it	13
is,”	13
returned	13
Don	13
Quixote,	13
“nay,	13
more,	13
one	13
of	13
the	13
best	13
in	13
this	13
whole	13
province,	13
and	13
it	13
has	13
within	13
it	13
people	13
who	13
have	13
had	13
the	13
sceptre	13
in	13
the	13
hand	13
and	13
the	13
crown	13
on	13
the	13
head.”	13
“It	13
would	13
be	13
better	13
if	13
it	13
were	13
the	13
other	13
way,”	13
said	13
the	13
traveller,	13
“the	13
sceptre	13
on	13
the	13
head	13
and	13
the	13
crown	13
in	13
the	13
hand;	13
but	13
if	13
so,	13
maybe	13
there	13
is	13
within	13
some	13
company	13
of	13
players,	13
with	13
whom	13
it	13
is	13
a	13
common	13
thing	13
to	13
have	13
those	13
crowns	13
and	13
sceptres	13
you	13
speak	13
of;	13
for	13
in	13
such	13
a	13
small	13
inn	13
as	13
this,	13
and	13
where	13
such	13
silence	13
is	13
kept,	13
I	13
do	13
not	13
believe	13
any	13
people	13
entitled	13
to	13
crowns	13
and	13
sceptres	13
can	13
have	13
taken	13
up	13
their	13
quarters.”	13
“You	13
know	13
but	13
little	13
of	13
the	13
world,”	13
returned	13
Don	13
Quixote,	13
“since	13
you	13
are	13
ignorant	13
of	13
what	13
commonly	13
occurs	13
in	13
knight-errantry.”	13
But	13
the	13
comrades	13
of	13
the	13
spokesman,	13
growing	13
weary	13
of	13
the	13
dialogue	13
with	13
Don	13
Quixote,	13
renewed	13
their	13
knocks	13
with	13
great	13
vehemence,	13
so	13
much	13
so	13
that	13
the	13
host,	13
and	13
not	13
only	13
he	13
but	13
everybody	13
in	13
the	13
inn,	13
awoke,	13
and	13
he	13
got	13
up	13
to	13
ask	13
who	13
knocked.	13
It	13
happened	13
at	13
this	13
moment	13
that	13
one	13
of	13
the	13
horses	13
of	13
the	13
four	13
who	13
were	13
seeking	13
admittance	13
went	13
to	13
smell	13
Rocinante,	13
who	13
melancholy,	13
dejected,	13
and	13
with	13
drooping	13
ears	13
stood	13
motionless,	13
supporting	13
his	13
sorely	13
stretched	13
master;	13
and	13
as	13
he	13
was,	13
after	13
all,	13
flesh,	13
though	13
he	13
looked	13
as	13
if	13
he	13
were	13
made	13
of	13
wood,	13
he	13
could	13
not	13
help	13
giving	13
way	13
and	13
in	13
return	13
smelling	13
the	13
one	13
who	13
had	13
come	13
to	13
offer	13
him	13
attentions.	13
But	13
he	13
had	13
hardly	13
moved	13
at	13
all	13
when	13
Don	13
Quixote	13
lost	13
his	13
footing;	13
and	13
slipping	13
off	13
the	13
saddle,	13
he	13
would	13
have	13
come	13
to	13
the	13
ground,	13
but	13
for	13
being	13
suspended	13
by	13
the	13
arm,	13
which	13
caused	13
him	13
such	13
agony	13
that	13
he	13
believed	13
either	13
his	13
wrist	13
would	13
be	13
cut	13
through	13
or	13
his	13
arm	13
torn	13
off;	13
and	13
he	13
hung	13
so	13
near	13
the	13
ground	13
that	13
he	13
could	13
just	13
touch	13
it	13
with	13
his	13
feet,	13
which	13
was	13
all	13
the	13
worse	13
for	13
him;	13
for,	13
finding	13
how	13
little	13
was	13
wanted	13
to	13
enable	13
him	13
to	13
plant	13
his	13
feet	13
firmly,	13
he	13
struggled	13
and	13
stretched	13
himself	13
as	13
much	13
as	13
he	13
could	13
to	13
gain	13
a	13
footing;	13
just	13
like	13
those	13
undergoing	13
the	13
torture	13
of	13
the	13
strappado,	13
when	13
they	13
are	13
fixed	13
at	13
“touch	13
and	13
no	13
touch,”	13
who	13
aggravate	13
their	13
own	13
sufferings	13
by	13
their	13
violent	13
efforts	13
to	13
stretch	13
themselves,	13
deceived	13
by	13
the	13
hope	13
which	13
makes	13
them	13
fancy	13
that	13
with	13
a	13
very	13
little	13
more	13
they	13
will	13
reach	13
the	13
ground.	13

So	13
loud,	13
in	13
fact,	13
were	13
the	13
shouts	13
of	13
Don	13
Quixote,	13
that	13
the	13
landlord	13
opening	13
the	13
gate	13
of	13
the	13
inn	13
in	13
all	13
haste,	13
came	13
out	13
in	13
dismay,	13
and	13
ran	13
to	13
see	13
who	13
was	13
uttering	13
such	13
cries,	13
and	13
those	13
who	13
were	13
outside	13
joined	13
him.	13
Maritornes,	13
who	13
had	13
been	13
by	13
this	13
time	13
roused	13
up	13
by	13
the	13
same	13
outcry,	13
suspecting	13
what	13
it	13
was,	13
ran	13
to	13
the	13
loft	13
and,	13
without	13
anyone	13
seeing	13
her,	13
untied	13
the	13
halter	13
by	13
which	13
Don	13
Quixote	13
was	13
suspended,	13
and	13
down	13
he	13
came	13
to	13
the	13
ground	13
in	13
the	13
sight	13
of	13
the	13
landlord	13
and	13
the	13
travellers,	13
who	13
approaching	13
asked	13
him	13
what	13
was	13
the	13
matter	13
with	13
him	13
that	13
he	13
shouted	13
so.	13
He	13
without	13
replying	13
a	13
word	13
took	13
the	13
rope	13
off	13
his	13
wrist,	13
and	13
rising	13
to	13
his	13
feet	13
leaped	13
upon	13
Rocinante,	13
braced	13
his	13
buckler	13
on	13
his	13
arm,	13
put	13
his	13
lance	13
in	13
rest,	13
and	13
making	13
a	13
considerable	13
circuit	13
of	13
the	13
plain	13
came	13
back	13
at	13
a	13
half-gallop	13
exclaiming:	13
“Whoever	13
shall	13
say	13
that	13
I	13
have	13
been	13
enchanted	13
with	13
just	13
cause,	13
provided	13
my	13
lady	13
the	13
Princess	13
Micomicona	13
grants	13
me	13
permission	13
to	13
do	13
so,	13
I	13
give	13
him	13
the	13
lie,	13
challenge	13
him	13
and	13
defy	13
him	13
to	13
single	13
combat.”	13
The	13
newly	13
arrived	13
travellers	13
were	13
amazed	13
at	13
the	13
words	13
of	13
Don	13
Quixote;	13
but	13
the	13
landlord	13
removed	13
their	13
surprise	13
by	13
telling	13
them	13
who	13
he	13
was,	13
and	13
not	13
to	13
mind	13
him	13
as	13
he	13
was	13
out	13
of	13
his	13
senses.	13
They	13
then	13
asked	13
the	13
landlord	13
if	13
by	13
any	13
chance	13
a	13
youth	13
of	13
about	13
fifteen	13
years	13
of	13
age	13
had	13
come	13
to	13
that	13
inn,	13
one	13
dressed	13
like	13
a	13
muleteer,	13
and	13
of	13
such	13
and	13
such	13
an	13
appearance,	13
describing	13
that	13
of	13
Doña	13
Clara’s	13
lover.	13
The	13
landlord	13
replied	13
that	13
there	13
were	13
so	13
many	13
people	13
in	13
the	13
inn	13
he	13
had	13
not	13
noticed	13
the	13
person	13
they	13
were	13
inquiring	13
for;	13
but	13
one	13
of	13
them	13
observing	13
the	13
coach	13
in	13
which	13
the	13
Judge	13
had	13
come,	13
said,	13
“He	13
is	13
here	13
no	13
doubt,	13
for	13
this	13
is	13
the	13
coach	13
he	13
is	13
following:	13
let	13
one	13
of	13
us	13
stay	13
at	13
the	13
gate,	13
and	13
the	13
rest	13
go	13
in	13
to	13
look	13
for	13
him;	13
or	13
indeed	13
it	13
would	13
be	13
as	13
well	13
if	13
one	13
of	13
us	13
went	13
round	13
the	13
inn,	13
lest	13
he	13
should	13
escape	13
over	13
the	13
wall	13
of	13
the	13
yard.”	13
“So	13
be	13
it,”	13
said	13
another;	13
and	13
while	13
two	13
of	13
them	13
went	13
in,	13
one	13
remained	13
at	13
the	13
gate	13
and	13
the	13
other	13
made	13
the	13
circuit	13
of	13
the	13
inn;	13
observing	13
all	13
which,	13
the	13
landlord	13
was	13
unable	13
to	13
conjecture	13
for	13
what	13
reason	13
they	13
were	13
taking	13
all	13
these	13
precautions,	13
though	13
he	13
understood	13
they	13
were	13
looking	13
for	13
the	13
youth	13
whose	13
description	13
they	13
had	13
given	13
him.	13
It	13
was	13
by	13
this	13
time	13
broad	13
daylight;	13
and	13
for	13
that	13
reason,	13
as	13
well	13
as	13
in	13
consequence	13
of	13
the	13
noise	13
Don	13
Quixote	13
had	13
made,	13
everybody	13
was	13
awake	13
and	13
up,	13
but	13
particularly	13
Doña	13
Clara	13
and	13
Dorothea;	13
for	13
they	13
had	13
been	13
able	13
to	13
sleep	13
but	13
badly	13
that	13
night,	13
the	13
one	13
from	13
agitation	13
at	13
having	13
her	13
lover	13
so	13
near	13
her,	13
the	13
other	13
from	13
curiosity	13
to	13
see	13
him.	13
Don	13
Quixote,	13
when	13
he	13
saw	13
that	13
not	13
one	13
of	13
the	13
four	13
travellers	13
took	13
any	13
notice	13
of	13
him	13
or	13
replied	13
to	13
his	13
challenge,	13
was	13
furious	13
and	13
ready	13
to	13
die	13
with	13
indignation	13
and	13
wrath;	13
and	13
if	13
he	13
could	13
have	13
found	13
in	13
the	13
ordinances	13
of	13
chivalry	13
that	13
it	13
was	13
lawful	13
for	13
a	13
knight-errant	13
to	13
undertake	13
or	13
engage	13
in	13
another	13
enterprise,	13
when	13
he	13
had	13
plighted	13
his	13
word	13
and	13
faith	13
not	13
to	13
involve	13
himself	13
in	13
any	13
until	13
he	13
had	13
made	13
an	13
end	13
of	13
the	13
one	13
to	13
which	13
he	13
was	13
pledged,	13
he	13
would	13
have	13
attacked	13
the	13
whole	13
of	13
them,	13
and	13
would	13
have	13
made	13
them	13
return	13
an	13
answer	13
in	13
spite	13
of	13
themselves.	13
But	13
considering	13
that	13
it	13
would	13
not	13
become	13
him,	13
nor	13
be	13
right,	13
to	13
begin	13
any	13
new	13
emprise	13
until	13
he	13
had	13
established	13
Micomicona	13
in	13
her	13
kingdom,	13
he	13
was	13
constrained	13
to	13
hold	13
his	13
peace	13
and	13
wait	13
quietly	13
to	13
see	13
what	13
would	13
be	13
the	13
upshot	13
of	13
the	13
proceedings	13
of	13
those	13
same	13
travellers;	13
one	13
of	13
whom	13
found	13
the	13
youth	13
they	13
were	13
seeking	13
lying	13
asleep	13
by	13
the	13
side	13
of	13
a	13
muleteer,	13
without	13
a	13
thought	13
of	13
anyone	13
coming	13
in	13
search	13
of	13
him,	13
much	13
less	13
finding	13
him.	13
The	13
man	13
laid	13
hold	13
of	13
him	13
by	13
the	13
arm,	13
saying,	13
“It	13
becomes	13
you	13
well	13
indeed,	13
Señor	13
Don	13
Luis,	13
to	13
be	13
in	13
the	13
dress	13
you	13
wear,	13
and	13
well	13
the	13
bed	13
in	13
which	13
I	13
find	13
you	13
agrees	13
with	13
the	13
luxury	13
in	13
which	13
your	13
mother	13
reared	13
you.”	13
The	13
youth	13
rubbed	13
his	13
sleepy	13
eyes	13
and	13
stared	13
for	13
a	13
while	13
at	13
him	13
who	13
held	13
him,	13
but	13
presently	13
recognised	13
him	13
as	13
one	13
of	13
his	13
father’s	13
servants,	13
at	13
which	13
he	13
was	13
so	13
taken	13
aback	13
that	13
for	13
some	13
time	13
he	13
could	13
not	13
find	13
or	13
utter	13
a	13
word;	13
while	13
the	13
servant	13
went	13
on	13
to	13
say,	13
“There	13
is	13
nothing	13
for	13
it	13
now,	13
Señor	13
Don	13
Luis,	13
but	13
to	13
submit	13
quietly	13
and	13
return	13
home,	13
unless	13
it	13
is	13
your	13
wish	13
that	13
my	13
lord,	13
your	13
father,	13
should	13
take	13
his	13
departure	13
for	13
the	13
other	13
world,	13
for	13
nothing	13
else	13
can	13
be	13
the	13
consequence	13
of	13
the	13
grief	13
he	13
is	13
in	13
at	13
your	13
absence.”	13
“But	13
how	13
did	13
my	13
father	13
know	13
that	13
I	13
had	13
gone	13
this	13
road	13
and	13
in	13
this	13
dress?”	13
said	13
Don	13
Luis.	13
“It	13
was	13
a	13
student	13
to	13
whom	13
you	13
confided	13
your	13
intentions,”	13
answered	13
the	13
servant,	13
“that	13
disclosed	13
them,	13
touched	13
with	13
pity	13
at	13
the	13
distress	13
he	13
saw	13
your	13
father	13
suffer	13
on	13
missing	13
you;	13
he	13
therefore	13
despatched	13
four	13
of	13
his	13
servants	13
in	13
quest	13
of	13
you,	13
and	13
here	13
we	13
all	13
are	13
at	13
your	13
service,	13
better	13
pleased	13
than	13
you	13
can	13
imagine	13
that	13
we	13
shall	13
return	13
so	13
soon	13
and	13
be	13
able	13
to	13
restore	13
you	13
to	13
those	13
eyes	13
that	13
so	13
yearn	13
for	13
you.”	13
“That	13
shall	13
be	13
as	13
I	13
please,	13
or	13
as	13
heaven	13
orders,”	13
returned	13
Don	13
Luis.	13
“What	13
can	13
you	13
please	13
or	13
heaven	13
order,”	13
said	13
the	13
other,	13
“except	13
to	13
agree	13
to	13
go	13
back?	13
Anything	13
else	13
is	13
impossible.”	13
All	13
this	13
conversation	13
between	13
the	13
two	13
was	13
overheard	13
by	13
the	13
muleteer	13
at	13
whose	13
side	13
Don	13
Luis	13
lay,	13
and	13
rising,	13
he	13
went	13
to	13
report	13
what	13
had	13
taken	13
place	13
to	13
Don	13
Fernando,	13
Cardenio,	13
and	13
the	13
others,	13
who	13
had	13
by	13
this	13
time	13
dressed	13
themselves;	13
and	13
told	13
them	13
how	13
the	13
man	13
had	13
addressed	13
the	13
youth	13
as	13
“Don,”	13
and	13
what	13
words	13
had	13
passed,	13
and	13
how	13
he	13
wanted	13
him	13
to	13
return	13
to	13
his	13
father,	13
which	13
the	13
youth	13
was	13
unwilling	13
to	13
do.	13
With	13
this,	13
and	13
what	13
they	13
already	13
knew	13
of	13
the	13
rare	13
voice	13
that	13
heaven	13
had	13
bestowed	13
upon	13
him,	13
they	13
all	13
felt	13
very	13
anxious	13
to	13
know	13
more	13
particularly	13
who	13
he	13
was,	13
and	13
even	13
to	13
help	13
him	13
if	13
it	13
was	13
attempted	13
to	13
employ	13
force	13
against	13
him;	13
so	13
they	13
hastened	13
to	13
where	13
he	13
was	13
still	13
talking	13
and	13
arguing	13
with	13
his	13
servant.	13
Dorothea	13
at	13
this	13
instant	13
came	13
out	13
of	13
her	13
room,	13
followed	13
by	13
Doña	13
Clara	13
all	13
in	13
a	13
tremor;	13
and	13
calling	13
Cardenio	13
aside,	13
she	13
told	13
him	13
in	13
a	13
few	13
words	13
the	13
story	13
of	13
the	13
musician	13
and	13
Doña	13
Clara,	13
and	13
he	13
at	13
the	13
same	13
time	13
told	13
her	13
what	13
had	13
happened,	13
how	13
his	13
father’s	13
servants	13
had	13
come	13
in	13
search	13
of	13
him;	13
but	13
in	13
telling	13
her	13
so,	13
he	13
did	13
not	13
speak	13
low	13
enough	13
but	13
that	13
Doña	13
Clara	13
heard	13
what	13
he	13
said,	13
at	13
which	13
she	13
was	13
so	13
much	13
agitated	13
that	13
had	13
not	13
Dorothea	13
hastened	13
to	13
support	13
her	13
she	13
would	13
have	13
fallen	13
to	13
the	13
ground.	13
Cardenio	13
then	13
bade	13
Dorothea	13
return	13
to	13
her	13
room,	13
as	13
he	13
would	13
endeavour	13
to	13
make	13
the	13
whole	13
matter	13
right,	13
and	13
they	13
did	13
as	13
he	13
desired.	13
All	13
the	13
four	13
who	13
had	13
come	13
in	13
quest	13
of	13
Don	13
Luis	13
had	13
now	13
come	13
into	13
the	13
inn	13
and	13
surrounded	13
him,	13
urging	13
him	13
to	13
return	13
and	13
console	13
his	13
father	13
at	13
once	13
and	13
without	13
a	13
moment’s	13
delay.	13
He	13
replied	13
that	13
he	13
could	13
not	13
do	13
so	13
on	13
any	13
account	13
until	13
he	13
had	13
concluded	13
some	13
business	13
in	13
which	13
his	13
life,	13
honour,	13
and	13
heart	13
were	13
at	13
stake.	13
The	13
servants	13
pressed	13
him,	13
saying	13
that	13
most	13
certainly	13
they	13
would	13
not	13
return	13
without	13
him,	13
and	13
that	13
they	13
would	13
take	13
him	13
away	13
whether	13
he	13
liked	13
it	13
or	13
not.	13
“You	13
shall	13
not	13
do	13
that,”	13
replied	13
Don	13
Luis,	13
“unless	13
you	13
take	13
me	13
dead;	13
though	13
however	13
you	13
take	13
me,	13
it	13
will	13
be	13
without	13
life.”	13
By	13
this	13
time	13
most	13
of	13
those	13
in	13
the	13
inn	13
had	13
been	13
attracted	13
by	13
the	13
dispute,	13
but	13
particularly	13
Cardenio,	13
Don	13
Fernando,	13
his	13
companions,	13
the	13
Judge,	13
the	13
curate,	13
the	13
barber,	13
and	13
Don	13
Quixote;	13
for	13
he	13
now	13
considered	13
there	13
was	13
no	13
necessity	13
for	13
mounting	13
guard	13
over	13
the	13
castle	13
any	13
longer.	13
Cardenio	13
being	13
already	13
acquainted	13
with	13
the	13
young	13
man’s	13
story,	13
asked	13
the	13
men	13
who	13
wanted	13
to	13
take	13
him	13
away,	13
what	13
object	13
they	13
had	13
in	13
seeking	13
to	13
carry	13
off	13
this	13
youth	13
against	13
his	13
will.	13
“Our	13
object,”	13
said	13
one	13
of	13
the	13
four,	13
“is	13
to	13
save	13
the	13
life	13
of	13
his	13
father,	13
who	13
is	13
in	13
danger	13
of	13
losing	13
it	13
through	13
this	13
gentleman’s	13
disappearance.”	13
Upon	13
this	13
Don	13
Luis	13
exclaimed,	13
“There	13
is	13
no	13
need	13
to	13
make	13
my	13
affairs	13
public	13
here;	13
I	13
am	13
free,	13
and	13
I	13
will	13
return	13
if	13
I	13
please;	13
and	13
if	13
not,	13
none	13
of	13
you	13
shall	13
compel	13
me.”	13
“Reason	13
will	13
compel	13
your	13
worship,”	13
said	13
the	13
man,	13
“and	13
if	13
it	13
has	13
no	13
power	13
over	13
you,	13
it	13
has	13
power	13
over	13
us,	13
to	13
make	13
us	13
do	13
what	13
we	13
came	13
for,	13
and	13
what	13
it	13
is	13
our	13
duty	13
to	13
do.”	13
“Let	13
us	13
hear	13
what	13
the	13
whole	13
affair	13
is	13
about,”	13
said	13
the	13
Judge	13
at	13
this;	13
but	13
the	13
man,	13
who	13
knew	13
him	13
as	13
a	13
neighbour	13
of	13
theirs,	13
replied,	13
“Do	13
you	13
not	13
know	13
this	13
gentleman,	13
Señor	13
Judge?	13
He	13
is	13
the	13
son	13
of	13
your	13
neighbour,	13
who	13
has	13
run	13
away	13
from	13
his	13
father’s	13
house	13
in	13
a	13
dress	13
so	13
unbecoming	13
his	13
rank,	13
as	13
your	13
worship	13
may	13
perceive.”	13
The	13
judge	13
on	13
this	13
looked	13
at	13
him	13
more	13
carefully	13
and	13
recognised	13
him,	13
and	13
embracing	13
him	13
said,	13
“What	13
folly	13
is	13
this,	13
Señor	13
Don	13
Luis,	13
or	13
what	13
can	13
have	13
been	13
the	13
cause	13
that	13
could	13
have	13
induced	13
you	13
to	13
come	13
here	13
in	13
this	13
way,	13
and	13
in	13
this	13
dress,	13
which	13
so	13
ill	13
becomes	13
your	13
condition?”	13
Tears	13
came	13
into	13
the	13
eyes	13
of	13
the	13
young	13
man,	13
and	13
he	13
was	13
unable	13
to	13
utter	13
a	13
word	13
in	13
reply	13
to	13
the	13
Judge,	13
who	13
told	13
the	13
four	13
servants	13
not	13
to	13
be	13
uneasy,	13
for	13
all	13
would	13
be	13
satisfactorily	13
settled;	13
and	13
then	13
taking	13
Don	13
Luis	13
by	13
the	13
hand,	13
he	13
drew	13
him	13
aside	13
and	13
asked	13
the	13
reason	13
of	13
his	13
having	13
come	13
there.	13
But	13
while	13
he	13
was	13
questioning	13
him	13
they	13
heard	13
a	13
loud	13
outcry	13
at	13
the	13
gate	13
of	13
the	13
inn,	13
the	13
cause	13
of	13
which	13
was	13
that	13
two	13
of	13
the	13
guests	13
who	13
had	13
passed	13
the	13
night	13
there,	13
seeing	13
everybody	13
busy	13
about	13
finding	13
out	13
what	13
it	13
was	13
the	13
four	13
men	13
wanted,	13
had	13
conceived	13
the	13
idea	13
of	13
going	13
off	13
without	13
paying	13
what	13
they	13
owed;	13
but	13
the	13
landlord,	13
who	13
minded	13
his	13
own	13
affairs	13
more	13
than	13
other	13
people’s,	13
caught	13
them	13
going	13
out	13
of	13
the	13
gate	13
and	13
demanded	13
his	13
reckoning,	13
abusing	13
them	13
for	13
their	13
dishonesty	13
with	13
such	13
language	13
that	13
he	13
drove	13
them	13
to	13
reply	13
with	13
their	13
fists,	13
and	13
so	13
they	13
began	13
to	13
lay	13
on	13
him	13
in	13
such	13
a	13
style	13
that	13
the	13
poor	13
man	13
was	13
forced	13
to	13
cry	13
out,	13
and	13
call	13
for	13
help.	13
The	13
landlady	13
and	13
her	13
daughter	13
could	13
see	13
no	13
one	13
more	13
free	13
to	13
give	13
aid	13
than	13
Don	13
Quixote,	13
and	13
to	13
him	13
the	13
daughter	13
said,	13
“Sir	13
knight,	13
by	13
the	13
virtue	13
God	13
has	13
given	13
you,	13
help	13
my	13
poor	13
father,	13
for	13
two	13
wicked	13
men	13
are	13
beating	13
him	13
to	13
a	13
mummy.”	13
To	13
which	13
Don	13
Quixote	13
very	13
deliberately	13
and	13
phlegmatically	13
replied,	13
“Fair	13
damsel,	13
at	13
the	13
present	13
moment	13
your	13
request	13
is	13
inopportune,	13
for	13
I	13
am	13
debarred	13
from	13
involving	13
myself	13
in	13
any	13
adventure	13
until	13
I	13
have	13
brought	13
to	13
a	13
happy	13
conclusion	13
one	13
to	13
which	13
my	13
word	13
has	13
pledged	13
me;	13
but	13
that	13
which	13
I	13
can	13
do	13
for	13
you	13
is	13
what	13
I	13
will	13
now	13
mention:	13
run	13
and	13
tell	13
your	13
father	13
to	13
stand	13
his	13
ground	13
as	13
well	13
as	13
he	13
can	13
in	13
this	13
battle,	13
and	13
on	13
no	13
account	13
to	13
allow	13
himself	13
to	13
be	13
vanquished,	13
while	13
I	13
go	13
and	13
request	13
permission	13
of	13
the	13
Princess	13
Micomicona	13
to	13
enable	13
me	13
to	13
succour	13
him	13
in	13
his	13
distress;	13
and	13
if	13
she	13
grants	13
it,	13
rest	13
assured	13
I	13
will	13
relieve	13
him	13
from	13
it.”	13
“Sinner	13
that	13
I	13
am,”	13
exclaimed	13
Maritornes,	13
who	13
stood	13
by;	13
“before	13
you	13
have	13
got	13
your	13
permission	13
my	13
master	13
will	13
be	13
in	13
the	13
other	13
world.”	13
“Give	13
me	13
leave,	13
señora,	13
to	13
obtain	13
the	13
permission	13
I	13
speak	13
of,”	13
returned	13
Don	13
Quixote;	13
“and	13
if	13
I	13
get	13
it,	13
it	13
will	13
matter	13
very	13
little	13
if	13
he	13
is	13
in	13
the	13
other	13
world;	13
for	13
I	13
will	13
rescue	13
him	13
thence	13
in	13
spite	13
of	13
all	13
the	13
same	13
world	13
can	13
do;	13
or	13
at	13
any	13
rate	13
I	13
will	13
give	13
you	13
such	13
a	13
revenge	13
over	13
those	13
who	13
shall	13
have	13
sent	13
him	13
there	13
that	13
you	13
will	13
be	13
more	13
than	13
moderately	13
satisfied;”	13
and	13
without	13
saying	13
anything	13
more	13
he	13
went	13
and	13
knelt	13
before	13
Dorothea,	13
requesting	13
her	13
Highness	13
in	13
knightly	13
and	13
errant	13
phrase	13
to	13
be	13
pleased	13
to	13
grant	13
him	13
permission	13
to	13
aid	13
and	13
succour	13
the	13
castellan	13
of	13
that	13
castle,	13
who	13
now	13
stood	13
in	13
grievous	13
jeopardy.	13
The	13
princess	13
granted	13
it	13
graciously,	13
and	13
he	13
at	13
once,	13
bracing	13
his	13
buckler	13
on	13
his	13
arm	13
and	13
drawing	13
his	13
sword,	13
hastened	13
to	13
the	13
inn-gate,	13
where	13
the	13
two	13
guests	13
were	13
still	13
handling	13
the	13
landlord	13
roughly;	13
but	13
as	13
soon	13
as	13
he	13
reached	13
the	13
spot	13
he	13
stopped	13
short	13
and	13
stood	13
still,	13
though	13
Maritornes	13
and	13
the	13
landlady	13
asked	13
him	13
why	13
he	13
hesitated	13
to	13
help	13
their	13
master	13
and	13
husband.	13
“I	13
hesitate,”	13
said	13
Don	13
Quixote,	13
“because	13
it	13
is	13
not	13
lawful	13
for	13
me	13
to	13
draw	13
sword	13
against	13
persons	13
of	13
squirely	13
condition;	13
but	13
call	13
my	13
squire	13
Sancho	13
to	13
me;	13
for	13
this	13
defence	13
and	13
vengeance	13
are	13
his	13
affair	13
and	13
business.”	13
Thus	13
matters	13
stood	13
at	13
the	13
inn-gate,	13
where	13
there	13
was	13
a	13
very	13
lively	13
exchange	13
of	13
fisticuffs	13
and	13
punches,	13
to	13
the	13
sore	13
damage	13
of	13
the	13
landlord	13
and	13
to	13
the	13
wrath	13
of	13
Maritornes,	13
the	13
landlady,	13
and	13
her	13
daughter,	13
who	13
were	13
furious	13
when	13
they	13
saw	13
the	13
pusillanimity	13
of	13
Don	13
Quixote,	13
and	13
the	13
hard	13
treatment	13
their	13
master,	13
husband	13
and	13
father	13
was	13
undergoing.	13
But	13
let	13
us	13
leave	13
him	13
there;	13
for	13
he	13
will	13
surely	13
find	13
someone	13
to	13
help	13
him,	13
and	13
if	13
not,	13
let	13
him	13
suffer	13
and	13
hold	13
his	13
tongue	13
who	13
attempts	13
more	13
than	13
his	13
strength	13
allows	13
him	13
to	13
do;	13
and	13
let	13
us	13
go	13
back	13
fifty	13
paces	13
to	13
see	13
what	13
Don	13
Luis	13
said	13
in	13
reply	13
to	13
the	13
Judge	13
whom	13
we	13
left	13
questioning	13
him	13
privately	13
as	13
to	13
his	13
reasons	13
for	13
coming	13
on	13
foot	13
and	13
so	13
meanly	13
dressed.	13
To	13
which	13
the	13
youth,	13
pressing	13
his	13
hand	13
in	13
a	13
way	13
that	13
showed	13
his	13
heart	13
was	13
troubled	13
by	13
some	13
great	13
sorrow,	13
and	13
shedding	13
a	13
flood	13
of	13
tears,	13
made	13
answer:	13
“Señor,	13
I	13
have	13
no	13
more	13
to	13
tell	13
you	13
than	13
that	13
from	13
the	13
moment	13
when,	13
through	13
heaven’s	13
will	13
and	13
our	13
being	13
near	13
neighbours,	13
I	13
first	13
saw	13
Doña	13
Clara,	13
your	13
daughter	13
and	13
my	13
lady,	13
from	13
that	13
instant	13
I	13
made	13
her	13
the	13
mistress	13
of	13
my	13
will,	13
and	13
if	13
yours,	13
my	13
true	13
lord	13
and	13
father,	13
offers	13
no	13
impediment,	13
this	13
very	13
day	13
she	13
shall	13
become	13
my	13
wife.	13
For	13
her	13
I	13
left	13
my	13
father’s	13
house,	13
and	13
for	13
her	13
I	13
assumed	13
this	13
disguise,	13
to	13
follow	13
her	13
whithersoever	13
she	13
may	13
go,	13
as	13
the	13
arrow	13
seeks	13
its	13
mark	13
or	13
the	13
sailor	13
the	13
pole-star.	13
She	13
knows	13
nothing	13
more	13
of	13
my	13
passion	13
than	13
what	13
she	13
may	13
have	13
learned	13
from	13
having	13
sometimes	13
seen	13
from	13
a	13
distance	13
that	13
my	13
eyes	13
were	13
filled	13
with	13
tears.	13
You	13
know	13
already,	13
señor,	13
the	13
wealth	13
and	13
noble	13
birth	13
of	13
my	13
parents,	13
and	13
that	13
I	13
am	13
their	13
sole	13
heir;	13
if	13
this	13
be	13
a	13
sufficient	13
inducement	13
for	13
you	13
to	13
venture	13
to	13
make	13
me	13
completely	13
happy,	13
accept	13
me	13
at	13
once	13
as	13
your	13
son;	13
for	13
if	13
my	13
father,	13
influenced	13
by	13
other	13
objects	13
of	13
his	13
own,	13
should	13
disapprove	13
of	13
this	13
happiness	13
I	13
have	13
sought	13
for	13
myself,	13
time	13
has	13
more	13
power	13
to	13
alter	13
and	13
change	13
things,	13
than	13
human	13
will.”	13
With	13
this	13
the	13
love-smitten	13
youth	13
was	13
silent,	13
while	13
the	13
Judge,	13
after	13
hearing	13
him,	13
was	13
astonished,	13
perplexed,	13
and	13
surprised,	13
as	13
well	13
at	13
the	13
manner	13
and	13
intelligence	13
with	13
which	13
Don	13
Luis	13
had	13
confessed	13
the	13
secret	13
of	13
his	13
heart,	13
as	13
at	13
the	13
position	13
in	13
which	13
he	13
found	13
himself,	13
not	13
knowing	13
what	13
course	13
to	13
take	13
in	13
a	13
matter	13
so	13
sudden	13
and	13
unexpected.	13
All	13
the	13
answer,	13
therefore,	13
he	13
gave	13
him	13
was	13
to	13
bid	13
him	13
to	13
make	13
his	13
mind	13
easy	13
for	13
the	13
present,	13
and	13
arrange	13
with	13
his	13
servants	13
not	13
to	13
take	13
him	13
back	13
that	13
day,	13
so	13
that	13
there	13
might	13
be	13
time	13
to	13
consider	13
what	13
was	13
best	13
for	13
all	13
parties.	13
Don	13
Luis	13
kissed	13
his	13
hands	13
by	13
force,	13
nay,	13
bathed	13
them	13
with	13
his	13
tears,	13
in	13
a	13
way	13
that	13
would	13
have	13
touched	13
a	13
heart	13
of	13
marble,	13
not	13
to	13
say	13
that	13
of	13
the	13
Judge,	13
who,	13
as	13
a	13
shrewd	13
man,	13
had	13
already	13
perceived	13
how	13
advantageous	13
the	13
marriage	13
would	13
be	13
to	13
his	13
daughter;	13
though,	13
were	13
it	13
possible,	13
he	13
would	13
have	13
preferred	13
that	13
it	13
should	13
be	13
brought	13
about	13
with	13
the	13
consent	13
of	13
the	13
father	13
of	13
Don	13
Luis,	13
who	13
he	13
knew	13
looked	13
for	13
a	13
title	13
for	13
his	13
son.	13
The	13
guests	13
had	13
by	13
this	13
time	13
made	13
peace	13
with	13
the	13
landlord,	13
for,	13
by	13
persuasion	13
and	13
Don	13
Quixote’s	13
fair	13
words	13
more	13
than	13
by	13
threats,	13
they	13
had	13
paid	13
him	13
what	13
he	13
demanded,	13
and	13
the	13
servants	13
of	13
Don	13
Luis	13
were	13
waiting	13
for	13
the	13
end	13
of	13
the	13
conversation	13
with	13
the	13
Judge	13
and	13
their	13
master’s	13
decision,	13
when	13
the	13
devil,	13
who	13
never	13
sleeps,	13
contrived	13
that	13
the	13
barber,	13
from	13
whom	13
Don	13
Quixote	13
had	13
taken	13
Mambrino’s	13
helmet,	13
and	13
Sancho	13
Panza	13
the	13
trappings	13
of	13
his	13
ass	13
in	13
exchange	13
for	13
those	13
of	13
his	13
own,	13
should	13
at	13
this	13
instant	13
enter	13
the	13
inn;	13
which	13
said	13
barber,	13
as	13
he	13
led	13
his	13
ass	13
to	13
the	13
stable,	13
observed	13
Sancho	13
Panza	13
engaged	13
in	13
repairing	13
something	13
or	13
other	13
belonging	13
to	13
the	13
pack-saddle;	13
and	13
the	13
moment	13
he	13
saw	13
it	13
he	13
knew	13
it,	13
and	13
made	13
bold	13
to	13
attack	13
Sancho,	13
exclaiming,	13
“Ho,	13
sir	13
thief,	13
I	13
have	13
caught	13
you!	13
hand	13
over	13
my	13
basin	13
and	13
my	13
pack-saddle,	13
and	13
all	13
my	13
trappings	13
that	13
you	13
robbed	13
me	13
of.”	13
Sancho,	13
finding	13
himself	13
so	13
unexpectedly	13
assailed,	13
and	13
hearing	13
the	13
abuse	13
poured	13
upon	13
him,	13
seized	13
the	13
pack-saddle	13
with	13
one	13
hand,	13
and	13
with	13
the	13
other	13
gave	13
the	13
barber	13
a	13
cuff	13
that	13
bathed	13
his	13
teeth	13
in	13
blood.	13
The	13
barber,	13
however,	13
was	13
not	13
so	13
ready	13
to	13
relinquish	13
the	13
prize	13
he	13
had	13
made	13
in	13
the	13
pack-saddle;	13
on	13
the	13
contrary,	13
he	13
raised	13
such	13
an	13
outcry	13
that	13
everyone	13
in	13
the	13
inn	13
came	13
running	13
to	13
know	13
what	13
the	13
noise	13
and	13
quarrel	13
meant.	13
“Here,	13
in	13
the	13
name	13
of	13
the	13
king	13
and	13
justice!”	13
he	13
cried,	13
“this	13
thief	13
and	13
highwayman	13
wants	13
to	13
kill	13
me	13
for	13
trying	13
to	13
recover	13
my	13
property.”	13
“You	13
lie,”	13
said	13
Sancho,	13
“I	13
am	13
no	13
highwayman;	13
it	13
was	13
in	13
fair	13
war	13
my	13
master	13
Don	13
Quixote	13
won	13
these	13
spoils.”	13
Don	13
Quixote	13
was	13
standing	13
by	13
at	13
the	13
time,	13
highly	13
pleased	13
to	13
see	13
his	13
squire’s	13
stoutness,	13
both	13
offensive	13
and	13
defensive,	13
and	13
from	13
that	13
time	13
forth	13
he	13
reckoned	13
him	13
a	13
man	13
of	13
mettle,	13
and	13
in	13
his	13
heart	13
resolved	13
to	13
dub	13
him	13
a	13
knight	13
on	13
the	13
first	13
opportunity	13
that	13
presented	13
itself,	13
feeling	13
sure	13
that	13
the	13
order	13
of	13
chivalry	13
would	13
be	13
fittingly	13
bestowed	13
upon	13
him.	13
In	13
the	13
course	13
of	13
the	13
altercation,	13
among	13
other	13
things	13
the	13
barber	13
said,	13
“Gentlemen,	13
this	13
pack-saddle	13
is	13
mine	13
as	13
surely	13
as	13
I	13
owe	13
God	13
a	13
death,	13
and	13
I	13
know	13
it	13
as	13
well	13
as	13
if	13
I	13
had	13
given	13
birth	13
to	13
it,	13
and	13
here	13
is	13
my	13
ass	13
in	13
the	13
stable	13
who	13
will	13
not	13
let	13
me	13
lie;	13
only	13
try	13
it,	13
and	13
if	13
it	13
does	13
not	13
fit	13
him	13
like	13
a	13
glove,	13
call	13
me	13
a	13
rascal;	13
and	13
what	13
is	13
more,	13
the	13
same	13
day	13
I	13
was	13
robbed	13
of	13
this,	13
they	13
robbed	13
me	13
likewise	13
of	13
a	13
new	13
brass	13
basin,	13
never	13
yet	13
handselled,	13
that	13
would	13
fetch	13
a	13
crown	13
any	13
day.”	13
At	13
this	13
Don	13
Quixote	13
could	13
not	13
keep	13
himself	13
from	13
answering;	13
and	13
interposing	13
between	13
the	13
two,	13
and	13
separating	13
them,	13
he	13
placed	13
the	13
pack-saddle	13
on	13
the	13
ground,	13
to	13
lie	13
there	13
in	13
sight	13
until	13
the	13
truth	13
was	13
established,	13
and	13
said,	13
“Your	13
worships	13
may	13
perceive	13
clearly	13
and	13
plainly	13
the	13
error	13
under	13
which	13
this	13
worthy	13
squire	13
lies	13
when	13
he	13
calls	13
a	13
basin	13
which	13
was,	13
is,	13
and	13
shall	13
be	13
the	13
helmet	13
of	13
Mambrino	13
which	13
I	13
won	13
from	13
him	13
in	13
fair	13
war,	13
and	13
made	13
myself	13
master	13
of	13
by	13
legitimate	13
and	13
lawful	13
possession.	13
With	13
the	13
pack-saddle	13
I	13
do	13
not	13
concern	13
myself;	13
but	13
I	13
may	13
tell	13
you	13
on	13
that	13
head	13
that	13
my	13
squire	13
Sancho	13
asked	13
my	13
permission	13
to	13
strip	13
off	13
the	13
caparison	13
of	13
this	13
vanquished	13
poltroon’s	13
steed,	13
and	13
with	13
it	13
adorn	13
his	13
own;	13
I	13
allowed	13
him,	13
and	13
he	13
took	13
it;	13
and	13
as	13
to	13
its	13
having	13
been	13
changed	13
from	13
a	13
caparison	13
into	13
a	13
pack-saddle,	13
I	13
can	13
give	13
no	13
explanation	13
except	13
the	13
usual	13
one,	13
that	13
such	13
transformations	13
will	13
take	13
place	13
in	13
adventures	13
of	13
chivalry.	13
To	13
confirm	13
all	13
which,	13
run,	13
Sancho	13
my	13
son,	13
and	13
fetch	13
hither	13
the	13
helmet	13
which	13
this	13
good	13
fellow	13
calls	13
a	13
basin.”	13
“Egad,	13
master,”	13
said	13
Sancho,	13
“if	13
we	13
have	13
no	13
other	13
proof	13
of	13
our	13
case	13
than	13
what	13
your	13
worship	13
puts	13
forward,	13
Mambrino’s	13
helmet	13
is	13
just	13
as	13
much	13
a	13
basin	13
as	13
this	13
good	13
fellow’s	13
caparison	13
is	13
a	13
pack-saddle.”	13
“Do	13
as	13
I	13
bid	13
thee,”	13
said	13
Don	13
Quixote;	13
“it	13
cannot	13
be	13
that	13
everything	13
in	13
this	13
castle	13
goes	13
by	13
enchantment.”	13
Sancho	13
hastened	13
to	13
where	13
the	13
basin	13
was,	13
and	13
brought	13
it	13
back	13
with	13
him,	13
and	13
when	13
Don	13
Quixote	13
saw	13
it,	13
he	13
took	13
hold	13
of	13
it	13
and	13
said:	13
“Your	13
worships	13
may	13
see	13
with	13
what	13
a	13
face	13
this	13
squire	13
can	13
assert	13
that	13
this	13
is	13
a	13
basin	13
and	13
not	13
the	13
helmet	13
I	13
told	13
you	13
of;	13
and	13
I	13
swear	13
by	13
the	13
order	13
of	13
chivalry	13
I	13
profess,	13
that	13
this	13
helmet	13
is	13
the	13
identical	13
one	13
I	13
took	13
from	13
him,	13
without	13
anything	13
added	13
to	13
or	13
taken	13
from	13
it.”	13
“There	13
is	13
no	13
doubt	13
of	13
that,”	13
said	13
Sancho,	13
“for	13
from	13
the	13
time	13
my	13
master	13
won	13
it	13
until	13
now	13
he	13
has	13
only	13
fought	13
one	13
battle	13
in	13
it,	13
when	13
he	13
let	13
loose	13
those	13
unlucky	13
men	13
in	13
chains;	13
and	13
if	13
it	13
had	13
not	13
been	13
for	13
this	13
basin-helmet	13
he	13
would	13
not	13
have	13
come	13
off	13
over	13
well	13
that	13
time,	13
for	13
there	13
was	13
plenty	13
of	13
stone-throwing	13
in	13
that	13
affair.”	13

“What	13
do	13
you	13
think	13
now,	13
gentlemen,”	13
said	13
the	13
barber,	13
“of	13
what	13
these	13
gentles	13
say,	13
when	13
they	13
want	13
to	13
make	13
out	13
that	13
this	13
is	13
a	13
helmet?”	13
“And	13
whoever	13
says	13
the	13
contrary,”	13
said	13
Don	13
Quixote,	13
“I	13
will	13
let	13
him	13
know	13
he	13
lies	13
if	13
he	13
is	13
a	13
knight,	13
and	13
if	13
he	13
is	13
a	13
squire	13
that	13
he	13
lies	13
again	13
a	13
thousand	13
times.”	13
Our	13
own	13
barber,	13
who	13
was	13
present	13
at	13
all	13
this,	13
and	13
understood	13
Don	13
Quixote’s	13
humour	13
so	13
thoroughly,	13
took	13
it	13
into	13
his	13
head	13
to	13
back	13
up	13
his	13
delusion	13
and	13
carry	13
on	13
the	13
joke	13
for	13
the	13
general	13
amusement;	13
so	13
addressing	13
the	13
other	13
barber	13
he	13
said:	13
“Señor	13
barber,	13
or	13
whatever	13
you	13
are,	13
you	13
must	13
know	13
that	13
I	13
belong	13
to	13
your	13
profession	13
too,	13
and	13
have	13
had	13
a	13
licence	13
to	13
practise	13
for	13
more	13
than	13
twenty	13
years,	13
and	13
I	13
know	13
the	13
implements	13
of	13
the	13
barber	13
craft,	13
every	13
one	13
of	13
them,	13
perfectly	13
well;	13
and	13
I	13
was	13
likewise	13
a	13
soldier	13
for	13
some	13
time	13
in	13
the	13
days	13
of	13
my	13
youth,	13
and	13
I	13
know	13
also	13
what	13
a	13
helmet	13
is,	13
and	13
a	13
morion,	13
and	13
a	13
headpiece	13
with	13
a	13
visor,	13
and	13
other	13
things	13
pertaining	13
to	13
soldiering,	13
I	13
meant	13
to	13
say	13
to	13
soldiers’	13
arms;	13
and	13
I	13
say—saving	13
better	13
opinions	13
and	13
always	13
with	13
submission	13
to	13
sounder	13
judgments—that	13
this	13
piece	13
we	13
have	13
now	13
before	13
us,	13
which	13
this	13
worthy	13
gentleman	13
has	13
in	13
his	13
hands,	13
not	13
only	13
is	13
no	13
barber’s	13
basin,	13
but	13
is	13
as	13
far	13
from	13
being	13
one	13
as	13
white	13
is	13
from	13
black,	13
and	13
truth	13
from	13
falsehood;	13
I	13
say,	13
moreover,	13
that	13
this,	13
although	13
it	13
is	13
a	13
helmet,	13
is	13
not	13
a	13
complete	13
helmet.”	13
“Certainly	13
not,”	13
said	13
Don	13
Quixote,	13
“for	13
half	13
of	13
it	13
is	13
wanting,	13
that	13
is	13
to	13
say	13
the	13
beaver.”	13
“It	13
is	13
quite	13
true,”	13
said	13
the	13
curate,	13
who	13
saw	13
the	13
object	13
of	13
his	13
friend	13
the	13
barber;	13
and	13
Cardenio,	13
Don	13
Fernando	13
and	13
his	13
companions	13
agreed	13
with	13
him,	13
and	13
even	13
the	13
Judge,	13
if	13
his	13
thoughts	13
had	13
not	13
been	13
so	13
full	13
of	13
Don	13
Luis’s	13
affair,	13
would	13
have	13
helped	13
to	13
carry	13
on	13
the	13
joke;	13
but	13
he	13
was	13
so	13
taken	13
up	13
with	13
the	13
serious	13
matters	13
he	13
had	13
on	13
his	13
mind	13
that	13
he	13
paid	13
little	13
or	13
no	13
attention	13
to	13
these	13
facetious	13
proceedings.	13
“God	13
bless	13
me!”	13
exclaimed	13
their	13
butt	13
the	13
barber	13
at	13
this;	13
“is	13
it	13
possible	13
that	13
such	13
an	13
honourable	13
company	13
can	13
say	13
that	13
this	13
is	13
not	13
a	13
basin	13
but	13
a	13
helmet?	13
Why,	13
this	13
is	13
a	13
thing	13
that	13
would	13
astonish	13
a	13
whole	13
university,	13
however	13
wise	13
it	13
might	13
be!	13
That	13
will	13
do;	13
if	13
this	13
basin	13
is	13
a	13
helmet,	13
why,	13
then	13
the	13
pack-saddle	13
must	13
be	13
a	13
horse’s	13
caparison,	13
as	13
this	13
gentleman	13
has	13
said.”	13
“To	13
me	13
it	13
looks	13
like	13
a	13
pack-saddle,”	13
said	13
Don	13
Quixote;	13
“but	13
I	13
have	13
already	13
said	13
that	13
with	13
that	13
question	13
I	13
do	13
not	13
concern	13
myself.”	13
“As	13
to	13
whether	13
it	13
be	13
pack-saddle	13
or	13
caparison,”	13
said	13
the	13
curate,	13
“it	13
is	13
only	13
for	13
Señor	13
Don	13
Quixote	13
to	13
say;	13
for	13
in	13
these	13
matters	13
of	13
chivalry	13
all	13
these	13
gentlemen	13
and	13
I	13
bow	13
to	13
his	13
authority.”	13
“By	13
God,	13
gentlemen,”	13
said	13
Don	13
Quixote,	13
“so	13
many	13
strange	13
things	13
have	13
happened	13
to	13
me	13
in	13
this	13
castle	13
on	13
the	13
two	13
occasions	13
on	13
which	13
I	13
have	13
sojourned	13
in	13
it,	13
that	13
I	13
will	13
not	13
venture	13
to	13
assert	13
anything	13
positively	13
in	13
reply	13
to	13
any	13
question	13
touching	13
anything	13
it	13
contains;	13
for	13
it	13
is	13
my	13
belief	13
that	13
everything	13
that	13
goes	13
on	13
within	13
it	13
goes	13
by	13
enchantment.	13
The	13
first	13
time,	13
an	13
enchanted	13
Moor	13
that	13
there	13
is	13
in	13
it	13
gave	13
me	13
sore	13
trouble,	13
nor	13
did	13
Sancho	13
fare	13
well	13
among	13
certain	13
followers	13
of	13
his;	13
and	13
last	13
night	13
I	13
was	13
kept	13
hanging	13
by	13
this	13
arm	13
for	13
nearly	13
two	13
hours,	13
without	13
knowing	13
how	13
or	13
why	13
I	13
came	13
by	13
such	13
a	13
mishap.	13
So	13
that	13
now,	13
for	13
me	13
to	13
come	13
forward	13
to	13
give	13
an	13
opinion	13
in	13
such	13
a	13
puzzling	13
matter,	13
would	13
be	13
to	13
risk	13
a	13
rash	13
decision.	13
As	13
regards	13
the	13
assertion	13
that	13
this	13
is	13
a	13
basin	13
and	13
not	13
a	13
helmet	13
I	13
have	13
already	13
given	13
an	13
answer;	13
but	13
as	13
to	13
the	13
question	13
whether	13
this	13
is	13
a	13
pack-saddle	13
or	13
a	13
caparison	13
I	13
will	13
not	13
venture	13
to	13
give	13
a	13
positive	13
opinion,	13
but	13
will	13
leave	13
it	13
to	13
your	13
worships’	13
better	13
judgment.	13
Perhaps	13
as	13
you	13
are	13
not	13
dubbed	13
knights	13
like	13
myself,	13
the	13
enchantments	13
of	13
this	13
place	13
have	13
nothing	13
to	13
do	13
with	13
you,	13
and	13
your	13
faculties	13
are	13
unfettered,	13
and	13
you	13
can	13
see	13
things	13
in	13
this	13
castle	13
as	13
they	13
really	13
and	13
truly	13
are,	13
and	13
not	13
as	13
they	13
appear	13
to	13
me.”	13
“There	13
can	13
be	13
no	13
question,”	13
said	13
Don	13
Fernando	13
on	13
this,	13
“but	13
that	13
Señor	13
Don	13
Quixote	13
has	13
spoken	13
very	13
wisely,	13
and	13
that	13
with	13
us	13
rests	13
the	13
decision	13
of	13
this	13
matter;	13
and	13
that	13
we	13
may	13
have	13
surer	13
ground	13
to	13
go	13
on,	13
I	13
will	13
take	13
the	13
votes	13
of	13
the	13
gentlemen	13
in	13
secret,	13
and	13
declare	13
the	13
result	13
clearly	13
and	13
fully.”	13
To	13
those	13
who	13
were	13
in	13
on	13
the	13
secret	13
of	13
Don	13
Quixote’s	13
humour	13
all	13
this	13
afforded	13
great	13
amusement;	13
but	13
to	13
those	13
who	13
knew	13
nothing	13
about	13
it,	13
it	13
seemed	13
the	13
greatest	13
nonsense	13
in	13
the	13
world,	13
in	13
particular	13
to	13
the	13
four	13
servants	13
of	13
Don	13
Luis,	13
as	13
well	13
as	13
to	13
Don	13
Luis	13
himself,	13
and	13
to	13
three	13
other	13
travellers	13
who	13
had	13
by	13
chance	13
come	13
to	13
the	13
inn,	13
and	13
had	13
the	13
appearance	13
of	13
officers	13
of	13
the	13
Holy	13
Brotherhood,	13
as	13
indeed	13
they	13
were;	13
but	13
the	13
one	13
who	13
above	13
all	13
was	13
at	13
his	13
wits’	13
end	13
was	13
the	13
barber	13
whose	13
basin,	13
there	13
before	13
his	13
very	13
eyes,	13
had	13
been	13
turned	13
into	13
Mambrino’s	13
helmet,	13
and	13
whose	13
pack-saddle	13
he	13
had	13
no	13
doubt	13
whatever	13
was	13
about	13
to	13
become	13
a	13
rich	13
caparison	13
for	13
a	13
horse.	13
All	13
laughed	13
to	13
see	13
Don	13
Fernando	13
going	13
from	13
one	13
to	13
another	13
collecting	13
the	13
votes,	13
and	13
whispering	13
to	13
them	13
to	13
give	13
him	13
their	13
private	13
opinion	13
whether	13
the	13
treasure	13
over	13
which	13
there	13
had	13
been	13
so	13
much	13
fighting	13
was	13
a	13
pack-saddle	13
or	13
a	13
caparison;	13
but	13
after	13
he	13
had	13
taken	13
the	13
votes	13
of	13
those	13
who	13
knew	13
Don	13
Quixote,	13
he	13
said	13
aloud,	13
“The	13
fact	13
is,	13
my	13
good	13
fellow,	13
that	13
I	13
am	13
tired	13
collecting	13
such	13
a	13
number	13
of	13
opinions,	13
for	13
I	13
find	13
that	13
there	13
is	13
not	13
one	13
of	13
whom	13
I	13
ask	13
what	13
I	13
desire	13
to	13
know,	13
who	13
does	13
not	13
tell	13
me	13
that	13
it	13
is	13
absurd	13
to	13
say	13
that	13
this	13
is	13
the	13
pack-saddle	13
of	13
an	13
ass,	13
and	13
not	13
the	13
caparison	13
of	13
a	13
horse,	13
nay,	13
of	13
a	13
thoroughbred	13
horse;	13
so	13
you	13
must	13
submit,	13
for,	13
in	13
spite	13
of	13
you	13
and	13
your	13
ass,	13
this	13
is	13
a	13
caparison	13
and	13
no	13
pack-saddle,	13
and	13
you	13
have	13
stated	13
and	13
proved	13
your	13
case	13
very	13
badly.”	13
“May	13
I	13
never	13
share	13
heaven,”	13
said	13
the	13
poor	13
barber,	13
“if	13
your	13
worships	13
are	13
not	13
all	13
mistaken;	13
and	13
may	13
my	13
soul	13
appear	13
before	13
God	13
as	13
that	13
appears	13
to	13
me	13
a	13
pack-saddle	13
and	13
not	13
a	13
caparison;	13
but,	13
‘laws	13
go,’—I	13
say	13
no	13
more;	13
and	13
indeed	13
I	13
am	13
not	13
drunk,	13
for	13
I	13
am	13
fasting,	13
except	13
it	13
be	13
from	13
sin.”	13
The	13
simple	13
talk	13
of	13
the	13
barber	13
did	13
not	13
afford	13
less	13
amusement	13
than	13
the	13
absurdities	13
of	13
Don	13
Quixote,	13
who	13
now	13
observed:	13
“There	13
is	13
no	13
more	13
to	13
be	13
done	13
now	13
than	13
for	13
each	13
to	13
take	13
what	13
belongs	13
to	13
him,	13
and	13
to	13
whom	13
God	13
has	13
given	13
it,	13
may	13
St.	13
Peter	13
add	13
his	13
blessing.”	13
But	13
said	13
one	13
of	13
the	13
four	13
servants,	13
“Unless,	13
indeed,	13
this	13
is	13
a	13
deliberate	13
joke,	13
I	13
cannot	13
bring	13
myself	13
to	13
believe	13
that	13
men	13
so	13
intelligent	13
as	13
those	13
present	13
are,	13
or	13
seem	13
to	13
be,	13
can	13
venture	13
to	13
declare	13
and	13
assert	13
that	13
this	13
is	13
not	13
a	13
basin,	13
and	13
that	13
not	13
a	13
pack-saddle;	13
but	13
as	13
I	13
perceive	13
that	13
they	13
do	13
assert	13
and	13
declare	13
it,	13
I	13
can	13
only	13
come	13
to	13
the	13
conclusion	13
that	13
there	13
is	13
some	13
mystery	13
in	13
this	13
persistence	13
in	13
what	13
is	13
so	13
opposed	13
to	13
the	13
evidence	13
of	13
experience	13
and	13
truth	13
itself;	13
for	13
I	13
swear	13
by”—and	13
here	13
he	13
rapped	13
out	13
a	13
round	13
oath—“all	13
the	13
people	13
in	13
the	13
world	13
will	13
not	13
make	13
me	13
believe	13
that	13
this	13
is	13
not	13
a	13
barber’s	13
basin	13
and	13
that	13
a	13
jackass’s	13
pack-saddle.”	13
“It	13
might	13
easily	13
be	13
a	13
she-ass’s,”	13
observed	13
the	13
curate.	13
“It	13
is	13
all	13
the	13
same,”	13
said	13
the	13
servant;	13
“that	13
is	13
not	13
the	13
point;	13
but	13
whether	13
it	13
is	13
or	13
is	13
not	13
a	13
pack-saddle,	13
as	13
your	13
worships	13
say.”	13
On	13
hearing	13
this	13
one	13
of	13
the	13
newly	13
arrived	13
officers	13
of	13
the	13
Brotherhood,	13
who	13
had	13
been	13
listening	13
to	13
the	13
dispute	13
and	13
controversy,	13
unable	13
to	13
restrain	13
his	13
anger	13
and	13
impatience,	13
exclaimed,	13
“It	13
is	13
a	13
pack-saddle	13
as	13
sure	13
as	13
my	13
father	13
is	13
my	13
father,	13
and	13
whoever	13
has	13
said	13
or	13
will	13
say	13
anything	13
else	13
must	13
be	13
drunk.”	13
“You	13
lie	13
like	13
a	13
rascally	13
clown,”	13
returned	13
Don	13
Quixote;	13
and	13
lifting	13
his	13
pike,	13
which	13
he	13
had	13
never	13
let	13
out	13
of	13
his	13
hand,	13
he	13
delivered	13
such	13
a	13
blow	13
at	13
his	13
head	13
that,	13
had	13
not	13
the	13
officer	13
dodged	13
it,	13
it	13
would	13
have	13
stretched	13
him	13
at	13
full	13
length.	13
The	13
pike	13
was	13
shivered	13
in	13
pieces	13
against	13
the	13
ground,	13
and	13
the	13
rest	13
of	13
the	13
officers,	13
seeing	13
their	13
comrade	13
assaulted,	13
raised	13
a	13
shout,	13
calling	13
for	13
help	13
for	13
the	13
Holy	13
Brotherhood.	13
The	13
landlord,	13
who	13
was	13
of	13
the	13
fraternity,	13
ran	13
at	13
once	13
to	13
fetch	13
his	13
staff	13
of	13
office	13
and	13
his	13
sword,	13
and	13
ranged	13
himself	13
on	13
the	13
side	13
of	13
his	13
comrades;	13
the	13
servants	13
of	13
Don	13
Luis	13
clustered	13
round	13
him,	13
lest	13
he	13
should	13
escape	13
from	13
them	13
in	13
the	13
confusion;	13
the	13
barber,	13
seeing	13
the	13
house	13
turned	13
upside	13
down,	13
once	13
more	13
laid	13
hold	13
of	13
his	13
pack-saddle	13
and	13
Sancho	13
did	13
the	13
same;	13
Don	13
Quixote	13
drew	13
his	13
sword	13
and	13
charged	13
the	13
officers;	13
Don	13
Luis	13
cried	13
out	13
to	13
his	13
servants	13
to	13
leave	13
him	13
alone	13
and	13
go	13
and	13
help	13
Don	13
Quixote,	13
and	13
Cardenio	13
and	13
Don	13
Fernando,	13
who	13
were	13
supporting	13
him;	13
the	13
curate	13
was	13
shouting	13
at	13
the	13
top	13
of	13
his	13
voice,	13
the	13
landlady	13
was	13
screaming,	13
her	13
daughter	13
was	13
wailing,	13
Maritornes	13
was	13
weeping,	13
Dorothea	13
was	13
aghast,	13
Luscinda	13
terror-stricken,	13
and	13
Doña	13
Clara	13
in	13
a	13
faint.	13
The	13
barber	13
cudgelled	13
Sancho,	13
and	13
Sancho	13
pommelled	13
the	13
barber;	13
Don	13
Luis	13
gave	13
one	13
of	13
his	13
servants,	13
who	13
ventured	13
to	13
catch	13
him	13
by	13
the	13
arm	13
to	13
keep	13
him	13
from	13
escaping,	13
a	13
cuff	13
that	13
bathed	13
his	13
teeth	13
in	13
blood;	13
the	13
Judge	13
took	13
his	13
part;	13
Don	13
Fernando	13
had	13
got	13
one	13
of	13
the	13
officers	13
down	13
and	13
was	13
belabouring	13
him	13
heartily;	13
the	13
landlord	13
raised	13
his	13
voice	13
again	13
calling	13
for	13
help	13
for	13
the	13
Holy	13
Brotherhood;	13
so	13
that	13
the	13
whole	13
inn	13
was	13
nothing	13
but	13
cries,	13
shouts,	13
shrieks,	13
confusion,	13
terror,	13
dismay,	13
mishaps,	13
sword-cuts,	13
fisticuffs,	13
cudgellings,	13
kicks,	13
and	13
bloodshed;	13
and	13
in	13
the	13
midst	13
of	13
all	13
this	13
chaos,	13
complication,	13
and	13
general	13
entanglement,	13
Don	13
Quixote	13
took	13
it	13
into	13
his	13
head	13
that	13
he	13
had	13
been	13
plunged	13
into	13
the	13
thick	13
of	13
the	13
discord	13
of	13
Agramante’s	13
camp;	13
and,	13
in	13
a	13
voice	13
that	13
shook	13
the	13
inn	13
like	13
thunder,	13
he	13
cried	13
out:	13
“Hold	13
all,	13
let	13
all	13
sheathe	13
their	13
swords,	13
let	13
all	13
be	13
calm	13
and	13
attend	13
to	13
me	13
as	13
they	13
value	13
their	13
lives!”	13
All	13
paused	13
at	13
his	13
mighty	13
voice,	13
and	13
he	13
went	13
on	13
to	13
say,	13
“Did	13
I	13
not	13
tell	13
you,	13
sirs,	13
that	13
this	13
castle	13
was	13
enchanted,	13
and	13
that	13
a	13
legion	13
or	13
so	13
of	13
devils	13
dwelt	13
in	13
it?	13
In	13
proof	13
whereof	13
I	13
call	13
upon	13
you	13
to	13
behold	13
with	13
your	13
own	13
eyes	13
how	13
the	13
discord	13
of	13
Agramante’s	13
camp	13
has	13
come	13
hither,	13
and	13
been	13
transferred	13
into	13
the	13
midst	13
of	13
us.	13
See	13
how	13
they	13
fight,	13
there	13
for	13
the	13
sword,	13
here	13
for	13
the	13
horse,	13
on	13
that	13
side	13
for	13
the	13
eagle,	13
on	13
this	13
for	13
the	13
helmet;	13
we	13
are	13
all	13
fighting,	13
and	13
all	13
at	13
cross	13
purposes.	13
Come	13
then,	13
you,	13
Señor	13
Judge,	13
and	13
you,	13
señor	13
curate;	13
let	13
the	13
one	13
represent	13
King	13
Agramante	13
and	13
the	13
other	13
King	13
Sobrino,	13
and	13
make	13
peace	13
among	13
us;	13
for	13
by	13
God	13
Almighty	13
it	13
is	13
a	13
sorry	13
business	13
that	13
so	13
many	13
persons	13
of	13
quality	13
as	13
we	13
are	13
should	13
slay	13
one	13
another	13
for	13
such	13
trifling	13
cause.”	13
The	13
officers,	13
who	13
did	13
not	13
understand	13
Don	13
Quixote’s	13
mode	13
of	13
speaking,	13
and	13
found	13
themselves	13
roughly	13
handled	13
by	13
Don	13
Fernando,	13
Cardenio,	13
and	13
their	13
companions,	13
were	13
not	13
to	13
be	13
appeased;	13
the	13
barber	13
was,	13
however,	13
for	13
both	13
his	13
beard	13
and	13
his	13
pack-saddle	13
were	13
the	13
worse	13
for	13
the	13
struggle;	13
Sancho	13
like	13
a	13
good	13
servant	13
obeyed	13
the	13
slightest	13
word	13
of	13
his	13
master;	13
while	13
the	13
four	13
servants	13
of	13
Don	13
Luis	13
kept	13
quiet	13
when	13
they	13
saw	13
how	13
little	13
they	13
gained	13
by	13
not	13
being	13
so.	13
The	13
landlord	13
alone	13
insisted	13
upon	13
it	13
that	13
they	13
must	13
punish	13
the	13
insolence	13
of	13
this	13
madman,	13
who	13
at	13
every	13
turn	13
raised	13
a	13
disturbance	13
in	13
the	13
inn;	13
but	13
at	13
length	13
the	13
uproar	13
was	13
stilled	13
for	13
the	13
present;	13
the	13
pack-saddle	13
remained	13
a	13
caparison	13
till	13
the	13
day	13
of	13
judgment,	13
and	13
the	13
basin	13
a	13
helmet	13
and	13
the	13
inn	13
a	13
castle	13
in	13
Don	13
Quixote’s	13
imagination.	13
All	13
having	13
been	13
now	13
pacified	13
and	13
made	13
friends	13
by	13
the	13
persuasion	13
of	13
the	13
Judge	13
and	13
the	13
curate,	13
the	13
servants	13
of	13
Don	13
Luis	13
began	13
again	13
to	13
urge	13
him	13
to	13
return	13
with	13
them	13
at	13
once;	13
and	13
while	13
he	13
was	13
discussing	13
the	13
matter	13
with	13
them,	13
the	13
Judge	13
took	13
counsel	13
with	13
Don	13
Fernando,	13
Cardenio,	13
and	13
the	13
curate	13
as	13
to	13
what	13
he	13
ought	13
to	13
do	13
in	13
the	13
case,	13
telling	13
them	13
how	13
it	13
stood,	13
and	13
what	13
Don	13
Luis	13
had	13
said	13
to	13
him.	13
It	13
was	13
agreed	13
at	13
length	13
that	13
Don	13
Fernando	13
should	13
tell	13
the	13
servants	13
of	13
Don	13
Luis	13
who	13
he	13
was,	13
and	13
that	13
it	13
was	13
his	13
desire	13
that	13
Don	13
Luis	13
should	13
accompany	13
him	13
to	13
Andalusia,	13
where	13
he	13
would	13
receive	13
from	13
the	13
marquis	13
his	13
brother	13
the	13
welcome	13
his	13
quality	13
entitled	13
him	13
to;	13
for,	13
otherwise,	13
it	13
was	13
easy	13
to	13
see	13
from	13
the	13
determination	13
of	13
Don	13
Luis	13
that	13
he	13
would	13
not	13
return	13
to	13
his	13
father	13
at	13
present,	13
though	13
they	13
tore	13
him	13
to	13
pieces.	13
On	13
learning	13
the	13
rank	13
of	13
Don	13
Fernando	13
and	13
the	13
resolution	13
of	13
Don	13
Luis	13
the	13
four	13
then	13
settled	13
it	13
between	13
themselves	13
that	13
three	13
of	13
them	13
should	13
return	13
to	13
tell	13
his	13
father	13
how	13
matters	13
stood,	13
and	13
that	13
the	13
other	13
should	13
remain	13
to	13
wait	13
upon	13
Don	13
Luis,	13
and	13
not	13
leave	13
him	13
until	13
they	13
came	13
back	13
for	13
him,	13
or	13
his	13
father’s	13
orders	13
were	13
known.	13
Thus	13
by	13
the	13
authority	13
of	13
Agramante	13
and	13
the	13
wisdom	13
of	13
King	13
Sobrino	13
all	13
this	13
complication	13
of	13
disputes	13
was	13
arranged;	13
but	13
the	13
enemy	13
of	13
concord	13
and	13
hater	13
of	13
peace,	13
feeling	13
himself	13
slighted	13
and	13
made	13
a	13
fool	13
of,	13
and	13
seeing	13
how	13
little	13
he	13
had	13
gained	13
after	13
having	13
involved	13
them	13
all	13
in	13
such	13
an	13
elaborate	13
entanglement,	13
resolved	13
to	13
try	13
his	13
hand	13
once	13
more	13
by	13
stirring	13
up	13
fresh	13
quarrels	13
and	13
disturbances.	13
It	13
came	13
about	13
in	13
this	13
wise:	13
the	13
officers	13
were	13
pacified	13
on	13
learning	13
the	13
rank	13
of	13
those	13
with	13
whom	13
they	13
had	13
been	13
engaged,	13
and	13
withdrew	13
from	13
the	13
contest,	13
considering	13
that	13
whatever	13
the	13
result	13
might	13
be	13
they	13
were	13
likely	13
to	13
get	13
the	13
worst	13
of	13
the	13
battle;	13
but	13
one	13
of	13
them,	13
the	13
one	13
who	13
had	13
been	13
thrashed	13
and	13
kicked	13
by	13
Don	13
Fernando,	13
recollected	13
that	13
among	13
some	13
warrants	13
he	13
carried	13
for	13
the	13
arrest	13
of	13
certain	13
delinquents,	13
he	13
had	13
one	13
against	13
Don	13
Quixote,	13
whom	13
the	13
Holy	13
Brotherhood	13
had	13
ordered	13
to	13
be	13
arrested	13
for	13
setting	13
the	13
galley	13
slaves	13
free,	13
as	13
Sancho	13
had,	13
with	13
very	13
good	13
reason,	13
apprehended.	13
Suspecting	13
how	13
it	13
was,	13
then,	13
he	13
wished	13
to	13
satisfy	13
himself	13
as	13
to	13
whether	13
Don	13
Quixote’s	13
features	13
corresponded;	13
and	13
taking	13
a	13
parchment	13
out	13
of	13
his	13
bosom	13
he	13
lit	13
upon	13
what	13
he	13
was	13
in	13
search	13
of,	13
and	13
setting	13
himself	13
to	13
read	13
it	13
deliberately,	13
for	13
he	13
was	13
not	13
a	13
quick	13
reader,	13
as	13
he	13
made	13
out	13
each	13
word	13
he	13
fixed	13
his	13
eyes	13
on	13
Don	13
Quixote,	13
and	13
went	13
on	13
comparing	13
the	13
description	13
in	13
the	13
warrant	13
with	13
his	13
face,	13
and	13
discovered	13
that	13
beyond	13
all	13
doubt	13
he	13
was	13
the	13
person	13
described	13
in	13
it.	13
As	13
soon	13
as	13
he	13
had	13
satisfied	13
himself,	13
folding	13
up	13
the	13
parchment,	13
he	13
took	13
the	13
warrant	13
in	13
his	13
left	13
hand	13
and	13
with	13
his	13
right	13
seized	13
Don	13
Quixote	13
by	13
the	13
collar	13
so	13
tightly	13
that	13
he	13
did	13
not	13
allow	13
him	13
to	13
breathe,	13
and	13
shouted	13
aloud,	13
“Help	13
for	13
the	13
Holy	13
Brotherhood!	13
and	13
that	13
you	13
may	13
see	13
I	13
demand	13
it	13
in	13
earnest,	13
read	13
this	13
warrant	13
which	13
says	13
this	13
highwayman	13
is	13
to	13
be	13
arrested.”	13
The	13
curate	13
took	13
the	13
warrant	13
and	13
saw	13
that	13
what	13
the	13
officer	13
said	13
was	13
true,	13
and	13
that	13
it	13
agreed	13
with	13
Don	13
Quixote’s	13
appearance,	13
who,	13
on	13
his	13
part,	13
when	13
he	13
found	13
himself	13
roughly	13
handled	13
by	13
this	13
rascally	13
clown,	13
worked	13
up	13
to	13
the	13
highest	13
pitch	13
of	13
wrath,	13
and	13
all	13
his	13
joints	13
cracking	13
with	13
rage,	13
with	13
both	13
hands	13
seized	13
the	13
officer	13
by	13
the	13
throat	13
with	13
all	13
his	13
might,	13
so	13
that	13
had	13
he	13
not	13
been	13
helped	13
by	13
his	13
comrades	13
he	13
would	13
have	13
yielded	13
up	13
his	13
life	13
ere	13
Don	13
Quixote	13
released	13
his	13
hold.	13
The	13
landlord,	13
who	13
had	13
perforce	13
to	13
support	13
his	13
brother	13
officers,	13
ran	13
at	13
once	13
to	13
aid	13
them.	13
The	13
landlady,	13
when	13
she	13
saw	13
her	13
husband	13
engaged	13
in	13
a	13
fresh	13
quarrel,	13
lifted	13
up	13
her	13
voice	13
afresh,	13
and	13
its	13
note	13
was	13
immediately	13
caught	13
up	13
by	13
Maritornes	13
and	13
her	13
daughter,	13
calling	13
upon	13
heaven	13
and	13
all	13
present	13
for	13
help;	13
and	13
Sancho,	13
seeing	13
what	13
was	13
going	13
on,	13
exclaimed,	13
“By	13
the	13
Lord,	13
it	13
is	13
quite	13
true	13
what	13
my	13
master	13
says	13
about	13
the	13
enchantments	13
of	13
this	13
castle,	13
for	13
it	13
is	13
impossible	13
to	13
live	13
an	13
hour	13
in	13
peace	13
in	13
it!”	13
Don	13
Fernando	13
parted	13
the	13
officer	13
and	13
Don	13
Quixote,	13
and	13
to	13
their	13
mutual	13
contentment	13
made	13
them	13
relax	13
the	13
grip	13
by	13
which	13
they	13
held,	13
the	13
one	13
the	13
coat	13
collar,	13
the	13
other	13
the	13
throat	13
of	13
his	13
adversary;	13
for	13
all	13
this,	13
however,	13
the	13
officers	13
did	13
not	13
cease	13
to	13
demand	13
their	13
prisoner	13
and	13
call	13
on	13
them	13
to	13
help,	13
and	13
deliver	13
him	13
over	13
bound	13
into	13
their	13
power,	13
as	13
was	13
required	13
for	13
the	13
service	13
of	13
the	13
King	13
and	13
of	13
the	13
Holy	13
Brotherhood,	13
on	13
whose	13
behalf	13
they	13
again	13
demanded	13
aid	13
and	13
assistance	13
to	13
effect	13
the	13
capture	13
of	13
this	13
robber	13
and	13
footpad	13
of	13
the	13
highways.	13
Don	13
Quixote	13
smiled	13
when	13
he	13
heard	13
these	13
words,	13
and	13
said	13
very	13
calmly,	13
“Come	13
now,	13
base,	13
ill-born	13
brood;	13
call	13
ye	13
it	13
highway	13
robbery	13
to	13
give	13
freedom	13
to	13
those	13
in	13
bondage,	13
to	13
release	13
the	13
captives,	13
to	13
succour	13
the	13
miserable,	13
to	13
raise	13
up	13
the	13
fallen,	13
to	13
relieve	13
the	13
needy?	13
Infamous	13
beings,	13
who	13
by	13
your	13
vile	13
grovelling	13
intellects	13
deserve	13
that	13
heaven	13
should	13
not	13
make	13
known	13
to	13
you	13
the	13
virtue	13
that	13
lies	13
in	13
knight-errantry,	13
or	13
show	13
you	13
the	13
sin	13
and	13
ignorance	13
in	13
which	13
ye	13
lie	13
when	13
ye	13
refuse	13
to	13
respect	13
the	13
shadow,	13
not	13
to	13
say	13
the	13
presence,	13
of	13
any	13
knight-errant!	13
Come	13
now;	13
band,	13
not	13
of	13
officers,	13
but	13
of	13
thieves;	13
footpads	13
with	13
the	13
licence	13
of	13
the	13
Holy	13
Brotherhood;	13
tell	13
me	13
who	13
was	13
the	13
ignoramus	13
who	13
signed	13
a	13
warrant	13
of	13
arrest	13
against	13
such	13
a	13
knight	13
as	13
I	13
am?	13
Who	13
was	13
he	13
that	13
did	13
not	13
know	13
that	13
knights-errant	13
are	13
independent	13
of	13
all	13
jurisdictions,	13
that	13
their	13
law	13
is	13
their	13
sword,	13
their	13
charter	13
their	13
prowess,	13
and	13
their	13
edicts	13
their	13
will?	13
Who,	13
I	13
say	13
again,	13
was	13
the	13
fool	13
that	13
knows	13
not	13
that	13
there	13
are	13
no	13
letters	13
patent	13
of	13
nobility	13
that	13
confer	13
such	13
privileges	13
or	13
exemptions	13
as	13
a	13
knight-errant	13
acquires	13
the	13
day	13
he	13
is	13
dubbed	13
a	13
knight,	13
and	13
devotes	13
himself	13
to	13
the	13
arduous	13
calling	13
of	13
chivalry?	13
What	13
knight-errant	13
ever	13
paid	13
poll-tax,	13
duty,	13
queen’s	13
pin-money,	13
king’s	13
dues,	13
toll	13
or	13
ferry?	13
What	13
tailor	13
ever	13
took	13
payment	13
of	13
him	13
for	13
making	13
his	13
clothes?	13
What	13
castellan	13
that	13
received	13
him	13
in	13
his	13
castle	13
ever	13
made	13
him	13
pay	13
his	13
shot?	13
What	13
king	13
did	13
not	13
seat	13
him	13
at	13
his	13
table?	13
What	13
damsel	13
was	13
not	13
enamoured	13
of	13
him	13
and	13
did	13
not	13
yield	13
herself	13
up	13
wholly	13
to	13
his	13
will	13
and	13
pleasure?	13
And,	13
lastly,	13
what	13
knight-errant	13
has	13
there	13
been,	13
is	13
there,	13
or	13
will	13
there	13
ever	13
be	13
in	13
the	13
world,	13
not	13
bold	13
enough	13
to	13
give,	13
single-handed,	13
four	13
hundred	13
cudgellings	13
to	13
four	13
hundred	13
officers	13
of	13
the	13
Holy	13
Brotherhood	13
if	13
they	13
come	13
in	13
his	13
way?”	13

OF	13

While	13
Don	13
Quixote	13
was	13
talking	13
in	13
this	13
strain,	13
the	13
curate	13
was	13
endeavouring	13
to	13
persuade	13
the	13
officers	13
that	13
he	13
was	13
out	13
of	13
his	13
senses,	13
as	13
they	13
might	13
perceive	13
by	13
his	13
deeds	13
and	13
his	13
words,	13
and	13
that	13
they	13
need	13
not	13
press	13
the	13
matter	13
any	13
further,	13
for	13
even	13
if	13
they	13
arrested	13
him	13
and	13
carried	13
him	13
off,	13
they	13
would	13
have	13
to	13
release	13
him	13
by-and-by	13
as	13
a	13
madman;	13
to	13
which	13
the	13
holder	13
of	13
the	13
warrant	13
replied	13
that	13
he	13
had	13
nothing	13
to	13
do	13
with	13
inquiring	13
into	13
Don	13
Quixote’s	13
madness,	13
but	13
only	13
to	13
execute	13
his	13
superior’s	13
orders,	13
and	13
that	13
once	13
taken	13
they	13
might	13
let	13
him	13
go	13
three	13
hundred	13
times	13
if	13
they	13
liked.	13
“For	13
all	13
that,”	13
said	13
the	13
curate,	13
“you	13
must	13
not	13
take	13
him	13
away	13
this	13
time,	13
nor	13
will	13
he,	13
it	13
is	13
my	13
opinion,	13
let	13
himself	13
be	13
taken	13
away.”	13
In	13
short,	13
the	13
curate	13
used	13
such	13
arguments,	13
and	13
Don	13
Quixote	13
did	13
such	13
mad	13
things,	13
that	13
the	13
officers	13
would	13
have	13
been	13
more	13
mad	13
than	13
he	13
was	13
if	13
they	13
had	13
not	13
perceived	13
his	13
want	13
of	13
wits,	13
and	13
so	13
they	13
thought	13
it	13
best	13
to	13
allow	13
themselves	13
to	13
be	13
pacified,	13
and	13
even	13
to	13
act	13
as	13
peacemakers	13
between	13
the	13
barber	13
and	13
Sancho	13
Panza,	13
who	13
still	13
continued	13
their	13
altercation	13
with	13
much	13
bitterness.	13
In	13
the	13
end	13
they,	13
as	13
officers	13
of	13
justice,	13
settled	13
the	13
question	13
by	13
arbitration	13
in	13
such	13
a	13
manner	13
that	13
both	13
sides	13
were,	13
if	13
not	13
perfectly	13
contented,	13
at	13
least	13
to	13
some	13
extent	13
satisfied;	13
for	13
they	13
changed	13
the	13
pack-saddles,	13
but	13
not	13
the	13
girths	13
or	13
head-stalls;	13
and	13
as	13
to	13
Mambrino’s	13
helmet,	13
the	13
curate,	13
under	13
the	13
rose	13
and	13
without	13
Don	13
Quixote’s	13
knowing	13
it,	13
paid	13
eight	13
reals	13
for	13
the	13
basin,	13
and	13
the	13
barber	13
executed	13
a	13
full	13
receipt	13
and	13
engagement	13
to	13
make	13
no	13
further	13
demand	13
then	13
or	13
thenceforth	13
for	13
evermore,	13
amen.	13
These	13
two	13
disputes,	13
which	13
were	13
the	13
most	13
important	13
and	13
gravest,	13
being	13
settled,	13
it	13
only	13
remained	13
for	13
the	13
servants	13
of	13
Don	13
Luis	13
to	13
consent	13
that	13
three	13
of	13
them	13
should	13
return	13
while	13
one	13
was	13
left	13
to	13
accompany	13
him	13
whither	13
Don	13
Fernando	13
desired	13
to	13
take	13
him;	13
and	13
good	13
luck	13
and	13
better	13
fortune,	13
having	13
already	13
begun	13
to	13
solve	13
difficulties	13
and	13
remove	13
obstructions	13
in	13
favour	13
of	13
the	13
lovers	13
and	13
warriors	13
of	13
the	13
inn,	13
were	13
pleased	13
to	13
persevere	13
and	13
bring	13
everything	13
to	13
a	13
happy	13
issue;	13
for	13
the	13
servants	13
agreed	13
to	13
do	13
as	13
Don	13
Luis	13
wished;	13
which	13
gave	13
Doña	13
Clara	13
such	13
happiness	13
that	13
no	13
one	13
could	13
have	13
looked	13
into	13
her	13
face	13
just	13
then	13
without	13
seeing	13
the	13
joy	13
of	13
her	13
heart.	13
Zoraida,	13
though	13
she	13
did	13
not	13
fully	13
comprehend	13
all	13
she	13
saw,	13
was	13
grave	13
or	13
gay	13
without	13
knowing	13
why,	13
as	13
she	13
watched	13
and	13
studied	13
the	13
various	13
countenances,	13
but	13
particularly	13
her	13
Spaniard’s,	13
whom	13
she	13
followed	13
with	13
her	13
eyes	13
and	13
clung	13
to	13
with	13
her	13
soul.	13
The	13
gift	13
and	13
compensation	13
which	13
the	13
curate	13
gave	13
the	13
barber	13
had	13
not	13
escaped	13
the	13
landlord’s	13
notice,	13
and	13
he	13
demanded	13
Don	13
Quixote’s	13
reckoning,	13
together	13
with	13
the	13
amount	13
of	13
the	13
damage	13
to	13
his	13
wine-skins,	13
and	13
the	13
loss	13
of	13
his	13
wine,	13
swearing	13
that	13
neither	13
Rocinante	13
nor	13
Sancho’s	13
ass	13
should	13
leave	13
the	13
inn	13
until	13
he	13
had	13
been	13
paid	13
to	13
the	13
very	13
last	13
farthing.	13
The	13
curate	13
settled	13
all	13
amicably,	13
and	13
Don	13
Fernando	13
paid;	13
though	13
the	13
Judge	13
had	13
also	13
very	13
readily	13
offered	13
to	13
pay	13
the	13
score;	13
and	13
all	13
became	13
so	13
peaceful	13
and	13
quiet	13
that	13
the	13
inn	13
no	13
longer	13
reminded	13
one	13
of	13
the	13
discord	13
of	13
Agramante’s	13
camp,	13
as	13
Don	13
Quixote	13
said,	13
but	13
of	13
the	13
peace	13
and	13
tranquillity	13
of	13
the	13
days	13
of	13
Octavianus:	13
for	13
all	13
which	13
it	13
was	13
the	13
universal	13
opinion	13
that	13
their	13
thanks	13
were	13
due	13
to	13
the	13
great	13
zeal	13
and	13
eloquence	13
of	13
the	13
curate,	13
and	13
to	13
the	13
unexampled	13
generosity	13
of	13
Don	13
Fernando.	13
Finding	13
himself	13
now	13
clear	13
and	13
quit	13
of	13
all	13
quarrels,	13
his	13
squire’s	13
as	13
well	13
as	13
his	13
own,	13
Don	13
Quixote	13
considered	13
that	13
it	13
would	13
be	13
advisable	13
to	13
continue	13
the	13
journey	13
he	13
had	13
begun,	13
and	13
bring	13
to	13
a	13
close	13
that	13
great	13
adventure	13
for	13
which	13
he	13
had	13
been	13
called	13
and	13
chosen;	13
and	13
with	13
this	13
high	13
resolve	13
he	13
went	13
and	13
knelt	13
before	13
Dorothea,	13
who,	13
however,	13
would	13
not	13
allow	13
him	13
to	13
utter	13
a	13
word	13
until	13
he	13
had	13
risen;	13
so	13
to	13
obey	13
her	13
he	13
rose,	13
and	13
said,	13
“It	13
is	13
a	13
common	13
proverb,	13
fair	13
lady,	13
that	13
‘diligence	13
is	13
the	13
mother	13
of	13
good	13
fortune,’	13
and	13
experience	13
has	13
often	13
shown	13
in	13
important	13
affairs	13
that	13
the	13
earnestness	13
of	13
the	13
negotiator	13
brings	13
the	13
doubtful	13
case	13
to	13
a	13
successful	13
termination;	13
but	13
in	13
nothing	13
does	13
this	13
truth	13
show	13
itself	13
more	13
plainly	13
than	13
in	13
war,	13
where	13
quickness	13
and	13
activity	13
forestall	13
the	13
devices	13
of	13
the	13
enemy,	13
and	13
win	13
the	13
victory	13
before	13
the	13
foe	13
has	13
time	13
to	13
defend	13
himself.	13
All	13
this	13
I	13
say,	13
exalted	13
and	13
esteemed	13
lady,	13
because	13
it	13
seems	13
to	13
me	13
that	13
for	13
us	13
to	13
remain	13
any	13
longer	13
in	13
this	13
castle	13
now	13
is	13
useless,	13
and	13
may	13
be	13
injurious	13
to	13
us	13
in	13
a	13
way	13
that	13
we	13
shall	13
find	13
out	13
some	13
day;	13
for	13
who	13
knows	13
but	13
that	13
your	13
enemy	13
the	13
giant	13
may	13
have	13
learned	13
by	13
means	13
of	13
secret	13
and	13
diligent	13
spies	13
that	13
I	13
am	13
going	13
to	13
destroy	13
him,	13
and	13
if	13
the	13
opportunity	13
be	13
given	13
him	13
he	13
may	13
seize	13
it	13
to	13
fortify	13
himself	13
in	13
some	13
impregnable	13
castle	13
or	13
stronghold,	13
against	13
which	13
all	13
my	13
efforts	13
and	13
the	13
might	13
of	13
my	13
indefatigable	13
arm	13
may	13
avail	13
but	13
little?	13
Therefore,	13
lady,	13
let	13
us,	13
as	13
I	13
say,	13
forestall	13
his	13
schemes	13
by	13
our	13
activity,	13
and	13
let	13
us	13
depart	13
at	13
once	13
in	13
quest	13
of	13
fair	13
fortune;	13
for	13
your	13
highness	13
is	13
only	13
kept	13
from	13
enjoying	13
it	13
as	13
fully	13
as	13
you	13
could	13
desire	13
by	13
my	13
delay	13
in	13
encountering	13
your	13
adversary.”	13
Don	13
Quixote	13
held	13
his	13
peace	13
and	13
said	13
no	13
more,	13
calmly	13
awaiting	13
the	13
reply	13
of	13
the	13
beauteous	13
princess,	13
who,	13
with	13
commanding	13
dignity	13
and	13
in	13
a	13
style	13
adapted	13
to	13
Don	13
Quixote’s	13
own,	13
replied	13
to	13
him	13
in	13
these	13
words,	13
“I	13
give	13
you	13
thanks,	13
sir	13
knight,	13
for	13
the	13
eagerness	13
you,	13
like	13
a	13
good	13
knight	13
to	13
whom	13
it	13
is	13
a	13
natural	13
obligation	13
to	13
succour	13
the	13
orphan	13
and	13
the	13
needy,	13
display	13
to	13
afford	13
me	13
aid	13
in	13
my	13
sore	13
trouble;	13
and	13
heaven	13
grant	13
that	13
your	13
wishes	13
and	13
mine	13
may	13
be	13
realised,	13
so	13
that	13
you	13
may	13
see	13
that	13
there	13
are	13
women	13
in	13
this	13
world	13
capable	13
of	13
gratitude;	13
as	13
to	13
my	13
departure,	13
let	13
it	13
be	13
forthwith,	13
for	13
I	13
have	13
no	13
will	13
but	13
yours;	13
dispose	13
of	13
me	13
entirely	13
in	13
accordance	13
with	13
your	13
good	13
pleasure;	13
for	13
she	13
who	13
has	13
once	13
entrusted	13
to	13
you	13
the	13
defence	13
of	13
her	13
person,	13
and	13
placed	13
in	13
your	13
hands	13
the	13
recovery	13
of	13
her	13
dominions,	13
must	13
not	13
think	13
of	13
offering	13
opposition	13
to	13
that	13
which	13
your	13
wisdom	13
may	13
ordain.”	13
“On,	13
then,	13
in	13
God’s	13
name,”	13
said	13
Don	13
Quixote;	13
“for,	13
when	13
a	13
lady	13
humbles	13
herself	13
to	13
me,	13
I	13
will	13
not	13
lose	13
the	13
opportunity	13
of	13
raising	13
her	13
up	13
and	13
placing	13
her	13
on	13
the	13
throne	13
of	13
her	13
ancestors.	13
Let	13
us	13
depart	13
at	13
once,	13
for	13
the	13
common	13
saying	13
that	13
in	13
delay	13
there	13
is	13
danger,	13
lends	13
spurs	13
to	13
my	13
eagerness	13
to	13
take	13
the	13
road;	13
and	13
as	13
neither	13
heaven	13
has	13
created	13
nor	13
hell	13
seen	13
any	13
that	13
can	13
daunt	13
or	13
intimidate	13
me,	13
saddle	13
Rocinante,	13
Sancho,	13
and	13
get	13
ready	13
thy	13
ass	13
and	13
the	13
queen’s	13
palfrey,	13
and	13
let	13
us	13
take	13
leave	13
of	13
the	13
castellan	13
and	13
these	13
gentlemen,	13
and	13
go	13
hence	13
this	13
very	13
instant.”	13
Sancho,	13
who	13
was	13
standing	13
by	13
all	13
the	13
time,	13
said,	13
shaking	13
his	13
head,	13
“Ah!	13
master,	14
there	14
is	14
more	14
mischief	14
in	14
the	14
village	14
than	14
one	14
hears	14
of,	14
begging	14
all	14
good	14
bodies’	14
pardon.”	14
“What	14
mischief	14
can	14
there	14
be	14
in	14
any	14
village,	14
or	14
in	14
all	14
the	14
cities	14
of	14
the	14
world,	14
you	14
booby,	14
that	14
can	14
hurt	14
my	14
reputation?”	14
said	14
Don	14
Quixote.	14
“If	14
your	14
worship	14
is	14
angry,”	14
replied	14
Sancho,	14
“I	14
will	14
hold	14
my	14
tongue	14
and	14
leave	14
unsaid	14
what	14
as	14
a	14
good	14
squire	14
I	14
am	14
bound	14
to	14
say,	14
and	14
what	14
a	14
good	14
servant	14
should	14
tell	14
his	14
master.”	14
“Say	14
what	14
thou	14
wilt,”	14
returned	14
Don	14
Quixote,	14
“provided	14
thy	14
words	14
be	14
not	14
meant	14
to	14
work	14
upon	14
my	14
fears;	14
for	14
thou,	14
if	14
thou	14
fearest,	14
art	14
behaving	14
like	14
thyself;	14
but	14
I	14
like	14
myself,	14
in	14
not	14
fearing.”	14
“It	14
is	14
nothing	14
of	14
the	14
sort,	14
as	14
I	14
am	14
a	14
sinner	14
before	14
God,”	14
said	14
Sancho,	14
“but	14
that	14
I	14
take	14
it	14
to	14
be	14
sure	14
and	14
certain	14
that	14
this	14
lady,	14
who	14
calls	14
herself	14
queen	14
of	14
the	14
great	14
kingdom	14
of	14
Micomicon,	14
is	14
no	14
more	14
so	14
than	14
my	14
mother;	14
for,	14
if	14
she	14
was	14
what	14
she	14
says,	14
she	14
would	14
not	14
go	14
rubbing	14
noses	14
with	14
one	14
that	14
is	14
here	14
every	14
instant	14
and	14
behind	14
every	14
door.”	14
Dorothea	14
turned	14
red	14
at	14
Sancho’s	14
words,	14
for	14
the	14
truth	14
was	14
that	14
her	14
husband	14
Don	14
Fernando	14
had	14
now	14
and	14
then,	14
when	14
the	14
others	14
were	14
not	14
looking,	14
gathered	14
from	14
her	14
lips	14
some	14
of	14
the	14
reward	14
his	14
love	14
had	14
earned,	14
and	14
Sancho	14
seeing	14
this	14
had	14
considered	14
that	14
such	14
freedom	14
was	14
more	14
like	14
a	14
courtesan	14
than	14
a	14
queen	14
of	14
a	14
great	14
kingdom;	14
she,	14
however,	14
being	14
unable	14
or	14
not	14
caring	14
to	14
answer	14
him,	14
allowed	14
him	14
to	14
proceed,	14
and	14
he	14
continued,	14
“This	14
I	14
say,	14
señor,	14
because,	14
if	14
after	14
we	14
have	14
travelled	14
roads	14
and	14
highways,	14
and	14
passed	14
bad	14
nights	14
and	14
worse	14
days,	14
one	14
who	14
is	14
now	14
enjoying	14
himself	14
in	14
this	14
inn	14
is	14
to	14
reap	14
the	14
fruit	14
of	14
our	14
labours,	14
there	14
is	14
no	14
need	14
for	14
me	14
to	14
be	14
in	14
a	14
hurry	14
to	14
saddle	14
Rocinante,	14
put	14
the	14
pad	14
on	14
the	14
ass,	14
or	14
get	14
ready	14
the	14
palfrey;	14
for	14
it	14
will	14
be	14
better	14
for	14
us	14
to	14
stay	14
quiet,	14
and	14
let	14
every	14
jade	14
mind	14
her	14
spinning,	14
and	14
let	14
us	14
go	14
to	14
dinner.”	14
Good	14
God,	14
what	14
was	14
the	14
indignation	14
of	14
Don	14
Quixote	14
when	14
he	14
heard	14
the	14
audacious	14
words	14
of	14
his	14
squire!	14
So	14
great	14
was	14
it,	14
that	14
in	14
a	14
voice	14
inarticulate	14
with	14
rage,	14
with	14
a	14
stammering	14
tongue,	14
and	14
eyes	14
that	14
flashed	14
living	14
fire,	14
he	14
exclaimed,	14
“Rascally	14
clown,	14
boorish,	14
insolent,	14
and	14
ignorant,	14
ill-spoken,	14
foul-mouthed,	14
impudent	14
backbiter	14
and	14
slanderer!	14
Hast	14
thou	14
dared	14
to	14
utter	14
such	14
words	14
in	14
my	14
presence	14
and	14
in	14
that	14
of	14
these	14
illustrious	14
ladies?	14
Hast	14
thou	14
dared	14
to	14
harbour	14
such	14
gross	14
and	14
shameless	14
thoughts	14
in	14
thy	14
muddled	14
imagination?	14
Begone	14
from	14
my	14
presence,	14
thou	14
born	14
monster,	14
storehouse	14
of	14
lies,	14
hoard	14
of	14
untruths,	14
garner	14
of	14
knaveries,	14
inventor	14
of	14
scandals,	14
publisher	14
of	14
absurdities,	14
enemy	14
of	14
the	14
respect	14
due	14
to	14
royal	14
personages!	14
Begone,	14
show	14
thyself	14
no	14
more	14
before	14
me	14
under	14
pain	14
of	14
my	14
wrath;”	14
and	14
so	14
saying	14
he	14
knitted	14
his	14
brows,	14
puffed	14
out	14
his	14
cheeks,	14
gazed	14
around	14
him,	14
and	14
stamped	14
on	14
the	14
ground	14
violently	14
with	14
his	14
right	14
foot,	14
showing	14
in	14
every	14
way	14
the	14
rage	14
that	14
was	14
pent	14
up	14
in	14
his	14
heart;	14
and	14
at	14
his	14
words	14
and	14
furious	14
gestures	14
Sancho	14
was	14
so	14
scared	14
and	14
terrified	14
that	14
he	14
would	14
have	14
been	14
glad	14
if	14
the	14
earth	14
had	14
opened	14
that	14
instant	14
and	14
swallowed	14
him,	14
and	14
his	14
only	14
thought	14
was	14
to	14
turn	14
round	14
and	14
make	14
his	14
escape	14
from	14
the	14
angry	14
presence	14
of	14
his	14
master.	14
But	14
the	14
ready-witted	14
Dorothea,	14
who	14
by	14
this	14
time	14
so	14
well	14
understood	14
Don	14
Quixote’s	14
humour,	14
said,	14
to	14
mollify	14
his	14
wrath,	14
“Be	14
not	14
irritated	14
at	14
the	14
absurdities	14
your	14
good	14
squire	14
has	14
uttered,	14
Sir	14
Knight	14
of	14
the	14
Rueful	14
Countenance,	14
for	14
perhaps	14
he	14
did	14
not	14
utter	14
them	14
without	14
cause,	14
and	14
from	14
his	14
good	14
sense	14
and	14
Christian	14
conscience	14
it	14
is	14
not	14
likely	14
that	14
he	14
would	14
bear	14
false	14
witness	14
against	14
anyone.	14
We	14
may	14
therefore	14
believe,	14
without	14
any	14
hesitation,	14
that	14
since,	14
as	14
you	14
say,	14
sir	14
knight,	14
everything	14
in	14
this	14
castle	14
goes	14
and	14
is	14
brought	14
about	14
by	14
means	14
of	14
enchantment,	14
Sancho,	14
I	14
say,	14
may	14
possibly	14
have	14
seen,	14
through	14
this	14
diabolical	14
medium,	14
what	14
he	14
says	14
he	14
saw	14
so	14
much	14
to	14
the	14
detriment	14
of	14
my	14
modesty.”	14
“I	14
swear	14
by	14
God	14
Omnipotent,”	14
exclaimed	14
Don	14
Quixote	14
at	14
this,	14
“your	14
highness	14
has	14
hit	14
the	14
point;	14
and	14
that	14
some	14
vile	14
illusion	14
must	14
have	14
come	14
before	14
this	14
sinner	14
of	14
a	14
Sancho,	14
that	14
made	14
him	14
see	14
what	14
it	14
would	14
have	14
been	14
impossible	14
to	14
see	14
by	14
any	14
other	14
means	14
than	14
enchantments;	14
for	14
I	14
know	14
well	14
enough,	14
from	14
the	14
poor	14
fellow’s	14
goodness	14
and	14
harmlessness,	14
that	14
he	14
is	14
incapable	14
of	14
bearing	14
false	14
witness	14
against	14
anybody.”	14
“True,	14
no	14
doubt,”	14
said	14
Don	14
Fernando,	14
“for	14
which	14
reason,	14
Señor	14
Don	14
Quixote,	14
you	14
ought	14
to	14
forgive	14
him	14
and	14
restore	14
him	14
to	14
the	14
bosom	14
of	14
your	14
favour,	14
_sicut	14
erat	14
in	14
principio_,	14
before	14
illusions	14
of	14
this	14
sort	14
had	14
taken	14
away	14
his	14
senses.”	14
Don	14
Quixote	14
said	14
he	14
was	14
ready	14
to	14
pardon	14
him,	14
and	14
the	14
curate	14
went	14
for	14
Sancho,	14
who	14
came	14
in	14
very	14
humbly,	14
and	14
falling	14
on	14
his	14
knees	14
begged	14
for	14
the	14
hand	14
of	14
his	14
master,	14
who	14
having	14
presented	14
it	14
to	14
him	14
and	14
allowed	14
him	14
to	14
kiss	14
it,	14
gave	14
him	14
his	14
blessing	14
and	14
said,	14
“Now,	14
Sancho	14
my	14
son,	14
thou	14
wilt	14
be	14
convinced	14
of	14
the	14
truth	14
of	14
what	14
I	14
have	14
many	14
a	14
time	14
told	14
thee,	14
that	14
everything	14
in	14
this	14
castle	14
is	14
done	14
by	14
means	14
of	14
enchantment.”	14
“So	14
it	14
is,	14
I	14
believe,”	14
said	14
Sancho,	14
“except	14
the	14
affair	14
of	14
the	14
blanket,	14
which	14
came	14
to	14
pass	14
in	14
reality	14
by	14
ordinary	14
means.”	14
“Believe	14
it	14
not,”	14
said	14
Don	14
Quixote,	14
“for	14
had	14
it	14
been	14
so,	14
I	14
would	14
have	14
avenged	14
thee	14
that	14
instant,	14
or	14
even	14
now;	14
but	14
neither	14
then	14
nor	14
now	14
could	14
I,	14
nor	14
have	14
I	14
seen	14
anyone	14
upon	14
whom	14
to	14
avenge	14
thy	14
wrong.”	14
They	14
were	14
all	14
eager	14
to	14
know	14
what	14
the	14
affair	14
of	14
the	14
blanket	14
was,	14
and	14
the	14
landlord	14
gave	14
them	14
a	14
minute	14
account	14
of	14
Sancho’s	14
flights,	14
at	14
which	14
they	14
laughed	14
not	14
a	14
little,	14
and	14
at	14
which	14
Sancho	14
would	14
have	14
been	14
no	14
less	14
out	14
of	14
countenance	14
had	14
not	14
his	14
master	14
once	14
more	14
assured	14
him	14
it	14
was	14
all	14
enchantment.	14
For	14
all	14
that	14
his	14
simplicity	14
never	14
reached	14
so	14
high	14
a	14
pitch	14
that	14
he	14
could	14
persuade	14
himself	14
it	14
was	14
not	14
the	14
plain	14
and	14
simple	14
truth,	14
without	14
any	14
deception	14
whatever	14
about	14
it,	14
that	14
he	14
had	14
been	14
blanketed	14
by	14
beings	14
of	14
flesh	14
and	14
blood,	14
and	14
not	14
by	14
visionary	14
and	14
imaginary	14
phantoms,	14
as	14
his	14
master	14
believed	14
and	14
protested.	14
The	14
illustrious	14
company	14
had	14
now	14
been	14
two	14
days	14
in	14
the	14
inn;	14
and	14
as	14
it	14
seemed	14
to	14
them	14
time	14
to	14
depart,	14
they	14
devised	14
a	14
plan	14
so	14
that,	14
without	14
giving	14
Dorothea	14
and	14
Don	14
Fernando	14
the	14
trouble	14
of	14
going	14
back	14
with	14
Don	14
Quixote	14
to	14
his	14
village	14
under	14
pretence	14
of	14
restoring	14
Queen	14
Micomicona,	14
the	14
curate	14
and	14
the	14
barber	14
might	14
carry	14
him	14
away	14
with	14
them	14
as	14
they	14
proposed,	14
and	14
the	14
curate	14
be	14
able	14
to	14
take	14
his	14
madness	14
in	14
hand	14
at	14
home;	14
and	14
in	14
pursuance	14
of	14
their	14
plan	14
they	14
arranged	14
with	14
the	14
owner	14
of	14
an	14
oxcart	14
who	14
happened	14
to	14
be	14
passing	14
that	14
way	14
to	14
carry	14
him	14
after	14
this	14
fashion.	14
They	14
constructed	14
a	14
kind	14
of	14
cage	14
with	14
wooden	14
bars,	14
large	14
enough	14
to	14
hold	14
Don	14
Quixote	14
comfortably;	14
and	14
then	14
Don	14
Fernando	14
and	14
his	14
companions,	14
the	14
servants	14
of	14
Don	14
Luis,	14
and	14
the	14
officers	14
of	14
the	14
Brotherhood,	14
together	14
with	14
the	14
landlord,	14
by	14
the	14
directions	14
and	14
advice	14
of	14
the	14
curate,	14
covered	14
their	14
faces	14
and	14
disguised	14
themselves,	14
some	14
in	14
one	14
way,	14
some	14
in	14
another,	14
so	14
as	14
to	14
appear	14
to	14
Don	14
Quixote	14
quite	14
different	14
from	14
the	14
persons	14
he	14
had	14
seen	14
in	14
the	14
castle.	14
This	14
done,	14
in	14
profound	14
silence	14
they	14
entered	14
the	14
room	14
where	14
he	14
was	14
asleep,	14
taking	14
his	14
rest	14
after	14
the	14
past	14
frays,	14
and	14
advancing	14
to	14
where	14
he	14
was	14
sleeping	14
tranquilly,	14
not	14
dreaming	14
of	14
anything	14
of	14
the	14
kind	14
happening,	14
they	14
seized	14
him	14
firmly	14
and	14
bound	14
him	14
fast	14
hand	14
and	14
foot,	14
so	14
that,	14
when	14
he	14
awoke	14
startled,	14
he	14
was	14
unable	14
to	14
move,	14
and	14
could	14
only	14
marvel	14
and	14
wonder	14
at	14
the	14
strange	14
figures	14
he	14
saw	14
before	14
him;	14
upon	14
which	14
he	14
at	14
once	14
gave	14
way	14
to	14
the	14
idea	14
which	14
his	14
crazed	14
fancy	14
invariably	14
conjured	14
up	14
before	14
him,	14
and	14
took	14
it	14
into	14
his	14
head	14
that	14
all	14
these	14
shapes	14
were	14
phantoms	14
of	14
the	14
enchanted	14
castle,	14
and	14
that	14
he	14
himself	14
was	14
unquestionably	14
enchanted	14
as	14
he	14
could	14
neither	14
move	14
nor	14
help	14
himself;	14
precisely	14
what	14
the	14
curate,	14
the	14
concoctor	14
of	14
the	14
scheme,	14
expected	14
would	14
happen.	14
Of	14
all	14
that	14
were	14
there	14
Sancho	14
was	14
the	14
only	14
one	14
who	14
was	14
at	14
once	14
in	14
his	14
senses	14
and	14
in	14
his	14
own	14
proper	14
character,	14
and	14
he,	14
though	14
he	14
was	14
within	14
very	14
little	14
of	14
sharing	14
his	14
master’s	14
infirmity,	14
did	14
not	14
fail	14
to	14
perceive	14
who	14
all	14
these	14
disguised	14
figures	14
were;	14
but	14
he	14
did	14
not	14
dare	14
to	14
open	14
his	14
lips	14
until	14
he	14
saw	14
what	14
came	14
of	14
this	14
assault	14
and	14
capture	14
of	14
his	14
master;	14
nor	14
did	14
the	14
latter	14
utter	14
a	14
word,	14
waiting	14
to	14
the	14
upshot	14
of	14
his	14
mishap;	14
which	14
was	14
that	14
bringing	14
in	14
the	14
cage,	14
they	14
shut	14
him	14
up	14
in	14
it	14
and	14
nailed	14
the	14
bars	14
so	14
firmly	14
that	14
they	14
could	14
not	14
be	14
easily	14
burst	14
open.	14

They	14
then	14
took	14
him	14
on	14
their	14
shoulders,	14
and	14
as	14
they	14
passed	14
out	14
of	14
the	14
room	14
an	14
awful	14
voice—as	14
much	14
so	14
as	14
the	14
barber,	14
not	14
he	14
of	14
the	14
pack-saddle	14
but	14
the	14
other,	14
was	14
able	14
to	14
make	14
it—was	14
heard	14
to	14
say,	14
“O	14
Knight	14
of	14
the	14
Rueful	14
Countenance,	14
let	14
not	14
this	14
captivity	14
in	14
which	14
thou	14
art	14
placed	14
afflict	14
thee,	14
for	14
this	14
must	14
needs	14
be,	14
for	14
the	14
more	14
speedy	14
accomplishment	14
of	14
the	14
adventure	14
in	14
which	14
thy	14
great	14
heart	14
has	14
engaged	14
thee;	14
the	14
which	14
shall	14
be	14
accomplished	14
when	14
the	14
raging	14
Manchegan	14
lion	14
and	14
the	14
white	14
Tobosan	14
dove	14
shall	14
be	14
linked	14
together,	14
having	14
first	14
humbled	14
their	14
haughty	14
necks	14
to	14
the	14
gentle	14
yoke	14
of	14
matrimony.	14
And	14
from	14
this	14
marvellous	14
union	14
shall	14
come	14
forth	14
to	14
the	14
light	14
of	14
the	14
world	14
brave	14
whelps	14
that	14
shall	14
rival	14
the	14
ravening	14
claws	14
of	14
their	14
valiant	14
father;	14
and	14
this	14
shall	14
come	14
to	14
pass	14
ere	14
the	14
pursuer	14
of	14
the	14
flying	14
nymph	14
shall	14
in	14
his	14
swift	14
natural	14
course	14
have	14
twice	14
visited	14
the	14
starry	14
signs.	14
And	14
thou,	14
O	14
most	14
noble	14
and	14
obedient	14
squire	14
that	14
ever	14
bore	14
sword	14
at	14
side,	14
beard	14
on	14
face,	14
or	14
nose	14
to	14
smell	14
with,	14
be	14
not	14
dismayed	14
or	14
grieved	14
to	14
see	14
the	14
flower	14
of	14
knight-errantry	14
carried	14
away	14
thus	14
before	14
thy	14
very	14
eyes;	14
for	14
soon,	14
if	14
it	14
so	14
please	14
the	14
Framer	14
of	14
the	14
universe,	14
thou	14
shalt	14
see	14
thyself	14
exalted	14
to	14
such	14
a	14
height	14
that	14
thou	14
shalt	14
not	14
know	14
thyself,	14
and	14
the	14
promises	14
which	14
thy	14
good	14
master	14
has	14
made	14
thee	14
shall	14
not	14
prove	14
false;	14
and	14
I	14
assure	14
thee,	14
on	14
the	14
authority	14
of	14
the	14
sage	14
Mentironiana,	14
that	14
thy	14
wages	14
shall	14
be	14
paid	14
thee,	14
as	14
thou	14
shalt	14
see	14
in	14
due	14
season.	14
Follow	14
then	14
the	14
footsteps	14
of	14
the	14
valiant	14
enchanted	14
knight,	14
for	14
it	14
is	14
expedient	14
that	14
thou	14
shouldst	14
go	14
to	14
the	14
destination	14
assigned	14
to	14
both	14
of	14
you;	14
and	14
as	14
it	14
is	14
not	14
permitted	14
to	14
me	14
to	14
say	14
more,	14
God	14
be	14
with	14
thee;	14
for	14
I	14
return	14
to	14
that	14
place	14
I	14
wot	14
of;”	14
and	14
as	14
he	14
brought	14
the	14
prophecy	14
to	14
a	14
close	14
he	14
raised	14
his	14
voice	14
to	14
a	14
high	14
pitch,	14
and	14
then	14
lowered	14
it	14
to	14
such	14
a	14
soft	14
tone,	14
that	14
even	14
those	14
who	14
knew	14
it	14
was	14
all	14
a	14
joke	14
were	14
almost	14
inclined	14
to	14
take	14
what	14
they	14
heard	14
seriously.	14
Don	14
Quixote	14
was	14
comforted	14
by	14
the	14
prophecy	14
he	14
heard,	14
for	14
he	14
at	14
once	14
comprehended	14
its	14
meaning	14
perfectly,	14
and	14
perceived	14
it	14
was	14
promised	14
to	14
him	14
that	14
he	14
should	14
see	14
himself	14
united	14
in	14
holy	14
and	14
lawful	14
matrimony	14
with	14
his	14
beloved	14
Dulcinea	14
del	14
Toboso,	14
from	14
whose	14
blessed	14
womb	14
should	14
proceed	14
the	14
whelps,	14
his	14
sons,	14
to	14
the	14
eternal	14
glory	14
of	14
La	14
Mancha;	14
and	14
being	14
thoroughly	14
and	14
firmly	14
persuaded	14
of	14
this,	14
he	14
lifted	14
up	14
his	14
voice,	14
and	14
with	14
a	14
deep	14
sigh	14
exclaimed,	14
“Oh	14
thou,	14
whoever	14
thou	14
art,	14
who	14
hast	14
foretold	14
me	14
so	14
much	14
good,	14
I	14
implore	14
of	14
thee	14
that	14
on	14
my	14
part	14
thou	14
entreat	14
that	14
sage	14
enchanter	14
who	14
takes	14
charge	14
of	14
my	14
interests,	14
that	14
he	14
leave	14
me	14
not	14
to	14
perish	14
in	14
this	14
captivity	14
in	14
which	14
they	14
are	14
now	14
carrying	14
me	14
away,	14
ere	14
I	14
see	14
fulfilled	14
promises	14
so	14
joyful	14
and	14
incomparable	14
as	14
those	14
which	14
have	14
been	14
now	14
made	14
me;	14
for,	14
let	14
this	14
but	14
come	14
to	14
pass,	14
and	14
I	14
shall	14
glory	14
in	14
the	14
pains	14
of	14
my	14
prison,	14
find	14
comfort	14
in	14
these	14
chains	14
wherewith	14
they	14
bind	14
me,	14
and	14
regard	14
this	14
bed	14
whereon	14
they	14
stretch	14
me,	14
not	14
as	14
a	14
hard	14
battle-field,	14
but	14
as	14
a	14
soft	14
and	14
happy	14
nuptial	14
couch;	14
and	14
touching	14
the	14
consolation	14
of	14
Sancho	14
Panza,	14
my	14
squire,	14
I	14
rely	14
upon	14
his	14
goodness	14
and	14
rectitude	14
that	14
he	14
will	14
not	14
desert	14
me	14
in	14
good	14
or	14
evil	14
fortune;	14
for	14
if,	14
by	14
his	14
ill	14
luck	14
or	14
mine,	14
it	14
may	14
not	14
happen	14
to	14
be	14
in	14
my	14
power	14
to	14
give	14
him	14
the	14
island	14
I	14
have	14
promised,	14
or	14
any	14
equivalent	14
for	14
it,	14
at	14
least	14
his	14
wages	14
shall	14
not	14
be	14
lost;	14
for	14
in	14
my	14
will,	14
which	14
is	14
already	14
made,	14
I	14
have	14
declared	14
the	14
sum	14
that	14
shall	14
be	14
paid	14
to	14
him,	14
measured,	14
not	14
by	14
his	14
many	14
faithful	14
services,	14
but	14
by	14
the	14
means	14
at	14
my	14
disposal.”	14
Sancho	14
bowed	14
his	14
head	14
very	14
respectfully	14
and	14
kissed	14
both	14
his	14
hands,	14
for,	14
being	14
tied	14
together,	14
he	14
could	14
not	14
kiss	14
one;	14
and	14
then	14
the	14
apparitions	14
lifted	14
the	14
cage	14
upon	14
their	14
shoulders	14
and	14
fixed	14
it	14
upon	14
the	14
ox-cart.	14

When	14
Don	14
Quixote	14
saw	14
himself	14
caged	14
and	14
hoisted	14
on	14
the	14
cart	14
in	14
this	14
way,	14
he	14
said,	14
“Many	14
grave	14
histories	14
of	14
knights-errant	14
have	14
I	14
read;	14
but	14
never	14
yet	14
have	14
I	14
read,	14
seen,	14
or	14
heard	14
of	14
their	14
carrying	14
off	14
enchanted	14
knights-errant	14
in	14
this	14
fashion,	14
or	14
at	14
the	14
slow	14
pace	14
that	14
these	14
lazy,	14
sluggish	14
animals	14
promise;	14
for	14
they	14
always	14
take	14
them	14
away	14
through	14
the	14
air	14
with	14
marvellous	14
swiftness,	14
enveloped	14
in	14
a	14
dark	14
thick	14
cloud,	14
or	14
on	14
a	14
chariot	14
of	14
fire,	14
or	14
it	14
may	14
be	14
on	14
some	14
hippogriff	14
or	14
other	14
beast	14
of	14
the	14
kind;	14
but	14
to	14
carry	14
me	14
off	14
like	14
this	14
on	14
an	14
ox-cart!	14
By	14
God,	14
it	14
puzzles	14
me!	14
But	14
perhaps	14
the	14
chivalry	14
and	14
enchantments	14
of	14
our	14
day	14
take	14
a	14
different	14
course	14
from	14
that	14
of	14
those	14
in	14
days	14
gone	14
by;	14
and	14
it	14
may	14
be,	14
too,	14
that	14
as	14
I	14
am	14
a	14
new	14
knight	14
in	14
the	14
world,	14
and	14
the	14
first	14
to	14
revive	14
the	14
already	14
forgotten	14
calling	14
of	14
knight-adventurers,	14
they	14
may	14
have	14
newly	14
invented	14
other	14
kinds	14
of	14
enchantments	14
and	14
other	14
modes	14
of	14
carrying	14
off	14
the	14
enchanted.	14
What	14
thinkest	14
thou	14
of	14
the	14
matter,	14
Sancho	14
my	14
son?”	14

“I	14
don’t	14
know	14
what	14
to	14
think,”	14
answered	14
Sancho,	14
“not	14
being	14
as	14
well	14
read	14
as	14
your	14
worship	14
in	14
errant	14
writings;	14
but	14
for	14
all	14
that	14
I	14
venture	14
to	14
say	14
and	14
swear	14
that	14
these	14
apparitions	14
that	14
are	14
about	14
us	14
are	14
not	14
quite	14
catholic.”	14
“Catholic!”	14
said	14
Don	14
Quixote.	14
“Father	14
of	14
me!	14
how	14
can	14
they	14
be	14
Catholic	14
when	14
they	14
are	14
all	14
devils	14
that	14
have	14
taken	14
fantastic	14
shapes	14
to	14
come	14
and	14
do	14
this,	14
and	14
bring	14
me	14
to	14
this	14
condition?	14
And	14
if	14
thou	14
wouldst	14
prove	14
it,	14
touch	14
them,	14
and	14
feel	14
them,	14
and	14
thou	14
wilt	14
find	14
they	14
have	14
only	14
bodies	14
of	14
air,	14
and	14
no	14
consistency	14
except	14
in	14
appearance.”	14
“By	14
God,	14
master,”	14
returned	14
Sancho,	14
“I	14
have	14
touched	14
them	14
already;	14
and	14
that	14
devil,	14
that	14
goes	14
about	14
there	14
so	14
busily,	14
has	14
firm	14
flesh,	14
and	14
another	14
property	14
very	14
different	14
from	14
what	14
I	14
have	14
heard	14
say	14
devils	14
have,	14
for	14
by	14
all	14
accounts	14
they	14
all	14
smell	14
of	14
brimstone	14
and	14
other	14
bad	14
smells;	14
but	14
this	14
one	14
smells	14
of	14
amber	14
half	14
a	14
league	14
off.”	14
Sancho	14
was	14
here	14
speaking	14
of	14
Don	14
Fernando,	14
who,	14
like	14
a	14
gentleman	14
of	14
his	14
rank,	14
was	14
very	14
likely	14
perfumed	14
as	14
Sancho	14
said.	14
“Marvel	14
not	14
at	14
that,	14
Sancho	14
my	14
friend,”	14
said	14
Don	14
Quixote;	14
“for	14
let	14
me	14
tell	14
thee	14
devils	14
are	14
crafty;	14
and	14
even	14
if	14
they	14
do	14
carry	14
odours	14
about	14
with	14
them,	14
they	14
themselves	14
have	14
no	14
smell,	14
because	14
they	14
are	14
spirits;	14
or,	14
if	14
they	14
have	14
any	14
smell,	14
they	14
cannot	14
smell	14
of	14
anything	14
sweet,	14
but	14
of	14
something	14
foul	14
and	14
fetid;	14
and	14
the	14
reason	14
is	14
that	14
as	14
they	14
carry	14
hell	14
with	14
them	14
wherever	14
they	14
go,	14
and	14
can	14
get	14
no	14
ease	14
whatever	14
from	14
their	14
torments,	14
and	14
as	14
a	14
sweet	14
smell	14
is	14
a	14
thing	14
that	14
gives	14
pleasure	14
and	14
enjoyment,	14
it	14
is	14
impossible	14
that	14
they	14
can	14
smell	14
sweet;	14
if,	14
then,	14
this	14
devil	14
thou	14
speakest	14
of	14
seems	14
to	14
thee	14
to	14
smell	14
of	14
amber,	14
either	14
thou	14
art	14
deceiving	14
thyself,	14
or	14
he	14
wants	14
to	14
deceive	14
thee	14
by	14
making	14
thee	14
fancy	14
he	14
is	14
not	14
a	14
devil.”	14
Such	14
was	14
the	14
conversation	14
that	14
passed	14
between	14
master	14
and	14
man;	14
and	14
Don	14
Fernando	14
and	14
Cardenio,	14
apprehensive	14
of	14
Sancho’s	14
making	14
a	14
complete	14
discovery	14
of	14
their	14
scheme,	14
towards	14
which	14
he	14
had	14
already	14
gone	14
some	14
way,	14
resolved	14
to	14
hasten	14
their	14
departure,	14
and	14
calling	14
the	14
landlord	14
aside,	14
they	14
directed	14
him	14
to	14
saddle	14
Rocinante	14
and	14
put	14
the	14
pack-saddle	14
on	14
Sancho’s	14
ass,	14
which	14
he	14
did	14
with	14
great	14
alacrity.	14
In	14
the	14
meantime	14
the	14
curate	14
had	14
made	14
an	14
arrangement	14
with	14
the	14
officers	14
that	14
they	14
should	14
bear	14
them	14
company	14
as	14
far	14
as	14
his	14
village,	14
he	14
paying	14
them	14
so	14
much	14
a	14
day.	14
Cardenio	14
hung	14
the	14
buckler	14
on	14
one	14
side	14
of	14
the	14
bow	14
of	14
Rocinante’s	14
saddle	14
and	14
the	14
basin	14
on	14
the	14
other,	14
and	14
by	14
signs	14
commanded	14
Sancho	14
to	14
mount	14
his	14
ass	14
and	14
take	14
Rocinante’s	14
bridle,	14
and	14
at	14
each	14
side	14
of	14
the	14
cart	14
he	14
placed	14
two	14
officers	14
with	14
their	14
muskets;	14
but	14
before	14
the	14
cart	14
was	14
put	14
in	14
motion,	14
out	14
came	14
the	14
landlady	14
and	14
her	14
daughter	14
and	14
Maritornes	14
to	14
bid	14
Don	14
Quixote	14
farewell,	14
pretending	14
to	14
weep	14
with	14
grief	14
at	14
his	14
misfortune;	14
and	14
to	14
them	14
Don	14
Quixote	14
said:	14
“Weep	14
not,	14
good	14
ladies,	14
for	14
all	14
these	14
mishaps	14
are	14
the	14
lot	14
of	14
those	14
who	14
follow	14
the	14
profession	14
I	14
profess;	14
and	14
if	14
these	14
reverses	14
did	14
not	14
befall	14
me	14
I	14
should	14
not	14
esteem	14
myself	14
a	14
famous	14
knight-errant;	14
for	14
such	14
things	14
never	14
happen	14
to	14
knights	14
of	14
little	14
renown	14
and	14
fame,	14
because	14
nobody	14
in	14
the	14
world	14
thinks	14
about	14
them;	14
to	14
valiant	14
knights	14
they	14
do,	14
for	14
these	14
are	14
envied	14
for	14
their	14
virtue	14
and	14
valour	14
by	14
many	14
princes	14
and	14
other	14
knights	14
who	14
compass	14
the	14
destruction	14
of	14
the	14
worthy	14
by	14
base	14
means.	14
Nevertheless,	14
virtue	14
is	14
of	14
herself	14
so	14
mighty,	14
that,	14
in	14
spite	14
of	14
all	14
the	14
magic	14
that	14
Zoroaster	14
its	14
first	14
inventor	14
knew,	14
she	14
will	14
come	14
victorious	14
out	14
of	14
every	14
trial,	14
and	14
shed	14
her	14
light	14
upon	14
the	14
earth	14
as	14
the	14
sun	14
does	14
upon	14
the	14
heavens.	14
Forgive	14
me,	14
fair	14
ladies,	14
if,	14
through	14
inadvertence,	14
I	14
have	14
in	14
aught	14
offended	14
you;	14
for	14
intentionally	14
and	14
wittingly	14
I	14
have	14
never	14
done	14
so	14
to	14
any;	14
and	14
pray	14
to	14
God	14
that	14
he	14
deliver	14
me	14
from	14
this	14
captivity	14
to	14
which	14
some	14
malevolent	14
enchanter	14
has	14
consigned	14
me;	14
and	14
should	14
I	14
find	14
myself	14
released	14
therefrom,	14
the	14
favours	14
that	14
ye	14
have	14
bestowed	14
upon	14
me	14
in	14
this	14
castle	14
shall	14
be	14
held	14
in	14
memory	14
by	14
me,	14
that	14
I	14
may	14
acknowledge,	14
recognise,	14
and	14
requite	14
them	14
as	14
they	14
deserve.”	14
While	14
this	14
was	14
passing	14
between	14
the	14
ladies	14
of	14
the	14
castle	14
and	14
Don	14
Quixote,	14
the	14
curate	14
and	14
the	14
barber	14
bade	14
farewell	14
to	14
Don	14
Fernando	14
and	14
his	14
companions,	14
to	14
the	14
captain,	14
his	14
brother,	14
and	14
the	14
ladies,	14
now	14
all	14
made	14
happy,	14
and	14
in	14
particular	14
to	14
Dorothea	14
and	14
Luscinda.	14
They	14
all	14
embraced	14
one	14
another,	14
and	14
promised	14
to	14
let	14
each	14
other	14
know	14
how	14
things	14
went	14
with	14
them,	14
and	14
Don	14
Fernando	14
directed	14
the	14
curate	14
where	14
to	14
write	14
to	14
him,	14
to	14
tell	14
him	14
what	14
became	14
of	14
Don	14
Quixote,	14
assuring	14
him	14
that	14
there	14
was	14
nothing	14
that	14
could	14
give	14
him	14
more	14
pleasure	14
than	14
to	14
hear	14
of	14
it,	14
and	14
that	14
he	14
too,	14
on	14
his	14
part,	14
would	14
send	14
him	14
word	14
of	14
everything	14
he	14
thought	14
he	14
would	14
like	14
to	14
know,	14
about	14
his	14
marriage,	14
Zoraida’s	14
baptism,	14
Don	14
Luis’s	14
affair,	14
and	14
Luscinda’s	14
return	14
to	14
her	14
home.	14
The	14
curate	14
promised	14
to	14
comply	14
with	14
his	14
request	14
carefully,	14
and	14
they	14
embraced	14
once	14
more,	14
and	14
renewed	14
their	14
promises.	14
The	14
landlord	14
approached	14
the	14
curate	14
and	14
handed	14
him	14
some	14
papers,	14
saying	14
he	14
had	14
discovered	14
them	14
in	14
the	14
lining	14
of	14
the	14
valise	14
in	14
which	14
the	14
novel	14
of	14
“The	14
Ill-advised	14
Curiosity”	14
had	14
been	14
found,	14
and	14
that	14
he	14
might	14
take	14
them	14
all	14
away	14
with	14
him	14
as	14
their	14
owner	14
had	14
not	14
since	14
returned;	14
for,	14
as	14
he	14
could	14
not	14
read,	14
he	14
did	14
not	14
want	14
them	14
himself.	14
The	14
curate	14
thanked	14
him,	14
and	14
opening	14
them	14
he	14
saw	14
at	14
the	14
beginning	14
of	14
the	14
manuscript	14
the	14
words,	14
“Novel	14
of	14
Rinconete	14
and	14
Cortadillo,”	14
by	14
which	14
he	14
perceived	14
that	14
it	14
was	14
a	14
novel,	14
and	14
as	14
that	14
of	14
“The	14
Ill-advised	14
Curiosity”	14
had	14
been	14
good	14
he	14
concluded	14
this	14
would	14
be	14
so	14
too,	14
as	14
they	14
were	14
both	14
probably	14
by	14
the	14
same	14
author;	14
so	14
he	14
kept	14
it,	14
intending	14
to	14
read	14
it	14
when	14
he	14
had	14
an	14
opportunity.	14
He	14
then	14
mounted	14
and	14
his	14
friend	14
the	14
barber	14
did	14
the	14
same,	14
both	14
masked,	14
so	14
as	14
not	14
to	14
be	14
recognised	14
by	14
Don	14
Quixote,	14
and	14
set	14
out	14
following	14
in	14
the	14
rear	14
of	14
the	14
cart.	14
The	14
order	14
of	14
march	14
was	14
this:	14
first	14
went	14
the	14
cart	14
with	14
the	14
owner	14
leading	14
it;	14
at	14
each	14
side	14
of	14
it	14
marched	14
the	14
officers	14
of	14
the	14
Brotherhood,	14
as	14
has	14
been	14
said,	14
with	14
their	14
muskets;	14
then	14
followed	14
Sancho	14
Panza	14
on	14
his	14
ass,	14
leading	14
Rocinante	14
by	14
the	14
bridle;	14
and	14
behind	14
all	14
came	14
the	14
curate	14
and	14
the	14
barber	14
on	14
their	14
mighty	14
mules,	14
with	14
faces	14
covered,	14
as	14
aforesaid,	14
and	14
a	14
grave	14
and	14
serious	14
air,	14
measuring	14
their	14
pace	14
to	14
suit	14
the	14
slow	14
steps	14
of	14
the	14
oxen.	14
Don	14
Quixote	14
was	14
seated	14
in	14
the	14
cage,	14
with	14
his	14
hands	14
tied	14
and	14
his	14
feet	14
stretched	14
out,	14
leaning	14
against	14
the	14
bars	14
as	14
silent	14
and	14
as	14
patient	14
as	14
if	14
he	14
were	14
a	14
stone	14
statue	14
and	14
not	14
a	14
man	14
of	14
flesh.	14
Thus	14
slowly	14
and	14
silently	14
they	14
made,	14
it	14
might	14
be,	14
two	14
leagues,	14
until	14
they	14
reached	14
a	14
valley	14
which	14
the	14
carter	14
thought	14
a	14
convenient	14
place	14
for	14
resting	14
and	14
feeding	14
his	14
oxen,	14
and	14
he	14
said	14
so	14
to	14
the	14
curate,	14
but	14
the	14
barber	14
was	14
of	14
opinion	14
that	14
they	14
ought	14
to	14
push	14
on	14
a	14
little	14
farther,	14
as	14
at	14
the	14
other	14
side	14
of	14
a	14
hill	14
which	14
appeared	14
close	14
by	14
he	14
knew	14
there	14
was	14
a	14
valley	14
that	14
had	14
more	14
grass	14
and	14
much	14
better	14
than	14
the	14
one	14
where	14
they	14
proposed	14
to	14
halt;	14
and	14
his	14
advice	14
was	14
taken	14
and	14
they	14
continued	14
their	14
journey.	14
Just	14
at	14
that	14
moment	14
the	14
curate,	14
looking	14
back,	14
saw	14
coming	14
on	14
behind	14
them	14
six	14
or	14
seven	14
mounted	14
men,	14
well	14
found	14
and	14
equipped,	14
who	14
soon	14
overtook	14
them,	14
for	14
they	14
were	14
travelling,	14
not	14
at	14
the	14
sluggish,	14
deliberate	14
pace	14
of	14
oxen,	14
but	14
like	14
men	14
who	14
rode	14
canons’	14
mules,	14
and	14
in	14
haste	14
to	14
take	14
their	14
noontide	14
rest	14
as	14
soon	14
as	14
possible	14
at	14
the	14
inn	14
which	14
was	14
in	14
sight	14
not	14
a	14
league	14
off.	14
The	14
quick	14
travellers	14
came	14
up	14
with	14
the	14
slow,	14
and	14
courteous	14
salutations	14
were	14
exchanged;	14
and	14
one	14
of	14
the	14
new	14
comers,	14
who	14
was,	14
in	14
fact,	14
a	14
canon	14
of	14
Toledo	14
and	14
master	14
of	14
the	14
others	14
who	14
accompanied	14
him,	14
observing	14
the	14
regular	14
order	14
of	14
the	14
procession,	14
the	14
cart,	14
the	14
officers,	14
Sancho,	14
Rocinante,	14
the	14
curate	14
and	14
the	14
barber,	14
and	14
above	14
all	14
Don	14
Quixote	14
caged	14
and	14
confined,	14
could	14
not	14
help	14
asking	14
what	14
was	14
the	14
meaning	14
of	14
carrying	14
the	14
man	14
in	14
that	14
fashion;	14
though,	14
from	14
the	14
badges	14
of	14
the	14
officers,	14
he	14
already	14
concluded	14
that	14
he	14
must	14
be	14
some	14
desperate	14
highwayman	14
or	14
other	14
malefactor	14
whose	14
punishment	14
fell	14
within	14
the	14
jurisdiction	14
of	14
the	14
Holy	14
Brotherhood.	14
One	14
of	14
the	14
officers	14
to	14
whom	14
he	14
had	14
put	14
the	14
question,	14
replied,	14
“Let	14
the	14
gentleman	14
himself	14
tell	14
you	14
the	14
meaning	14
of	14
his	14
going	14
this	14
way,	14
señor,	14
for	14
we	14
do	14
not	14
know.”	14
Don	14
Quixote	14
overheard	14
the	14
conversation	14
and	14
said,	14
“Haply,	14
gentlemen,	14
you	14
are	14
versed	14
and	14
learned	14
in	14
matters	14
of	14
errant	14
chivalry?	14
Because	14
if	14
you	14
are	14
I	14
will	14
tell	14
you	14
my	14
misfortunes;	14
if	14
not,	14
there	14
is	14
no	14
good	14
in	14
my	14
giving	14
myself	14
the	14
trouble	14
of	14
relating	14
them;”	14
but	14
here	14
the	14
curate	14
and	14
the	14
barber,	14
seeing	14
that	14
the	14
travellers	14
were	14
engaged	14
in	14
conversation	14
with	14
Don	14
Quixote,	14
came	14
forward,	14
in	14
order	14
to	14
answer	14
in	14
such	14
a	14
way	14
as	14
to	14
save	14
their	14
stratagem	14
from	14
being	14
discovered.	14
The	14
canon,	14
replying	14
to	14
Don	14
Quixote,	14
said,	14
“In	14
truth,	14
brother,	14
I	14
know	14
more	14
about	14
books	14
of	14
chivalry	14
than	14
I	14
do	14
about	14
Villalpando’s	14
elements	14
of	14
logic;	14
so	14
if	14
that	14
be	14
all,	14
you	14
may	14
safely	14
tell	14
me	14
what	14
you	14
please.”	14
“In	14
God’s	14
name,	14
then,	14
señor,”	14
replied	14
Don	14
Quixote;	14
“if	14
that	14
be	14
so,	14
I	14
would	14
have	14
you	14
know	14
that	14
I	14
am	14
held	14
enchanted	14
in	14
this	14
cage	14
by	14
the	14
envy	14
and	14
fraud	14
of	14
wicked	14
enchanters;	14
for	14
virtue	14
is	14
more	14
persecuted	14
by	14
the	14
wicked	14
than	14
loved	14
by	14
the	14
good.	14
I	14
am	14
a	14
knight-errant,	14
and	14
not	14
one	14
of	14
those	14
whose	14
names	14
Fame	14
has	14
never	14
thought	14
of	14
immortalising	14
in	14
her	14
record,	14
but	14
of	14
those	14
who,	14
in	14
defiance	14
and	14
in	14
spite	14
of	14
envy	14
itself,	14
and	14
all	14
the	14
magicians	14
that	14
Persia,	14
or	14
Brahmans	14
that	14
India,	14
or	14
Gymnosophists	14
that	14
Ethiopia	14
ever	14
produced,	14
will	14
place	14
their	14
names	14
in	14
the	14
temple	14
of	14
immortality,	14
to	14
serve	14
as	14
examples	14
and	14
patterns	14
for	14
ages	14
to	14
come,	14
whereby	14
knights-errant	14
may	14
see	14
the	14
footsteps	14
in	14
which	14
they	14
must	14
tread	14
if	14
they	14
would	14
attain	14
the	14
summit	14
and	14
crowning	14
point	14
of	14
honour	14
in	14
arms.”	14
“What	14
Señor	14
Don	14
Quixote	14
of	14
La	14
Mancha	14
says,”	14
observed	14
the	14
curate,	14
“is	14
the	14
truth;	14
for	14
he	14
goes	14
enchanted	14
in	14
this	14
cart,	14
not	14
from	14
any	14
fault	14
or	14
sins	14
of	14
his,	14
but	14
because	14
of	14
the	14
malevolence	14
of	14
those	14
to	14
whom	14
virtue	14
is	14
odious	14
and	14
valour	14
hateful.	14
This,	14
señor,	14
is	14
the	14
Knight	14
of	14
the	14
Rueful	14
Countenance,	14
if	14
you	14
have	14
ever	14
heard	14
him	14
named,	14
whose	14
valiant	14
achievements	14
and	14
mighty	14
deeds	14
shall	14
be	14
written	14
on	14
lasting	14
brass	14
and	14
imperishable	14
marble,	14
notwithstanding	14
all	14
the	14
efforts	14
of	14
envy	14
to	14
obscure	14
them	14
and	14
malice	14
to	14
hide	14
them.”	14
When	14
the	14
canon	14
heard	14
both	14
the	14
prisoner	14
and	14
the	14
man	14
who	14
was	14
at	14
liberty	14
talk	14
in	14
such	14
a	14
strain	14
he	14
was	14
ready	14
to	14
cross	14
himself	14
in	14
his	14
astonishment,	14
and	14
could	14
not	14
make	14
out	14
what	14
had	14
befallen	14
him;	14
and	14
all	14
his	14
attendants	14
were	14
in	14
the	14
same	14
state	14
of	14
amazement.	14
At	14
this	14
point	14
Sancho	14
Panza,	14
who	14
had	14
drawn	14
near	14
to	14
hear	14
the	14
conversation,	14
said,	14
in	14
order	14
to	14
make	14
everything	14
plain,	14
“Well,	14
sirs,	14
you	14
may	14
like	14
or	14
dislike	14
what	14
I	14
am	14
going	14
to	14
say,	14
but	14
the	14
fact	14
of	14
the	14
matter	14
is,	14
my	14
master,	14
Don	14
Quixote,	14
is	14
just	14
as	14
much	14
enchanted	14
as	14
my	14
mother.	14
He	14
is	14
in	14
his	14
full	14
senses,	14
he	14
eats	14
and	14
he	14
drinks,	14
and	14
he	14
has	14
his	14
calls	14
like	14
other	14
men	14
and	14
as	14
he	14
had	14
yesterday,	14
before	14
they	14
caged	14
him.	14
And	14
if	14
that’s	14
the	14
case,	14
what	14
do	14
they	14
mean	14
by	14
wanting	14
me	14
to	14
believe	14
that	14
he	14
is	14
enchanted?	14
For	14
I	14
have	14
heard	14
many	14
a	14
one	14
say	14
that	14
enchanted	14
people	14
neither	14
eat,	14
nor	14
sleep,	14
nor	14
talk;	14
and	14
my	14
master,	14
if	14
you	14
don’t	14
stop	14
him,	14
will	14
talk	14
more	14
than	14
thirty	14
lawyers.”	14
Then	14
turning	14
to	14
the	14
curate	14
he	14
exclaimed,	14
“Ah,	14
señor	14
curate,	14
señor	14
curate!	14
do	14
you	14
think	14
I	14
don’t	14
know	14
you?	14
Do	14
you	14
think	14
I	14
don’t	14
guess	14
and	14
see	14
the	14
drift	14
of	14
these	14
new	14
enchantments?	14
Well	14
then,	14
I	14
can	14
tell	14
you	14
I	14
know	14
you,	14
for	14
all	14
your	14
face	14
is	14
covered,	14
and	14
I	14
can	14
tell	14
you	14
I	14
am	14
up	14
to	14
you,	14
however	14
you	14
may	14
hide	14
your	14
tricks.	14
After	14
all,	14
where	14
envy	14
reigns	14
virtue	14
cannot	14
live,	14
and	14
where	14
there	14
is	14
niggardliness	14
there	14
can	14
be	14
no	14
liberality.	14
Ill	14
betide	14
the	14
devil!	14
if	14
it	14
had	14
not	14
been	14
for	14
your	14
worship	14
my	14
master	14
would	14
be	14
married	14
to	14
the	14
Princess	14
Micomicona	14
this	14
minute,	14
and	14
I	14
should	14
be	14
a	14
count	14
at	14
least;	14
for	14
no	14
less	14
was	14
to	14
be	14
expected,	14
as	14
well	14
from	14
the	14
goodness	14
of	14
my	14
master,	14
him	14
of	14
the	14
Rueful	14
Countenance,	14
as	14
from	14
the	14
greatness	14
of	14
my	14
services.	14
But	14
I	14
see	14
now	14
how	14
true	14
it	14
is	14
what	14
they	14
say	14
in	14
these	14
parts,	14
that	14
the	14
wheel	14
of	14
fortune	14
turns	14
faster	14
than	14
a	14
mill-wheel,	14
and	14
that	14
those	14
who	14
were	14
up	14
yesterday	14
are	14
down	14
to-day.	14
I	14
am	14
sorry	14
for	14
my	14
wife	14
and	14
children,	14
for	14
when	14
they	14
might	14
fairly	14
and	14
reasonably	14
expect	14
to	14
see	14
their	14
father	14
return	14
to	14
them	14
a	14
governor	14
or	14
viceroy	14
of	14
some	14
island	14
or	14
kingdom,	14
they	14
will	14
see	14
him	14
come	14
back	14
a	14
horse-boy.	14
I	14
have	14
said	14
all	14
this,	14
señor	14
curate,	14
only	14
to	14
urge	14
your	14
paternity	14
to	14
lay	14
to	14
your	14
conscience	14
your	14
ill-treatment	14
of	14
my	14
master;	14
and	14
have	14
a	14
care	14
that	14
God	14
does	14
not	14
call	14
you	14
to	14
account	14
in	14
another	14
life	14
for	14
making	14
a	14
prisoner	14
of	14
him	14
in	14
this	14
way,	14
and	14
charge	14
against	14
you	14
all	14
the	14
succours	14
and	14
good	14
deeds	14
that	14
my	14
lord	14
Don	14
Quixote	14
leaves	14
undone	14
while	14
he	14
is	14
shut	14
up.	14
“Trim	14
those	14
lamps	14
there!”	14
exclaimed	14
the	14
barber	14
at	14
this;	14
“so	14
you	14
are	14
of	14
the	14
same	14
fraternity	14
as	14
your	14
master,	14
too,	14
Sancho?	14
By	14
God,	14
I	14
begin	14
to	14
see	14
that	14
you	14
will	14
have	14
to	14
keep	14
him	14
company	14
in	14
the	14
cage,	14
and	14
be	14
enchanted	14
like	14
him	14
for	14
having	14
caught	14
some	14
of	14
his	14
humour	14
and	14
chivalry.	14
It	14
was	14
an	14
evil	14
hour	14
when	14
you	14
let	14
yourself	14
be	14
got	14
with	14
child	14
by	14
his	14
promises,	14
and	14
that	14
island	14
you	14
long	14
so	14
much	14
for	14
found	14
its	14
way	14
into	14
your	14
head.”	14
“I	14
am	14
not	14
with	14
child	14
by	14
anyone,”	14
returned	14
Sancho,	14
“nor	14
am	14
I	14
a	14
man	14
to	14
let	14
myself	14
be	14
got	14
with	14
child,	14
if	14
it	14
was	14
by	14
the	14
King	14
himself.	14
Though	14
I	14
am	14
poor	14
I	14
am	14
an	14
old	14
Christian,	14
and	14
I	14
owe	14
nothing	14
to	14
nobody,	14
and	14
if	14
I	14
long	14
for	14
an	14
island,	14
other	14
people	14
long	14
for	14
worse.	14
Each	14
of	14
us	14
is	14
the	14
son	14
of	14
his	14
own	14
works;	14
and	14
being	14
a	14
man	14
I	14
may	14
come	14
to	14
be	14
pope,	14
not	14
to	14
say	14
governor	14
of	14
an	14
island,	14
especially	14
as	14
my	14
master	14
may	14
win	14
so	14
many	14
that	14
he	14
will	14
not	14
know	14
whom	14
to	14
give	14
them	14
to.	14
Mind	14
how	14
you	14
talk,	14
master	14
barber;	14
for	14
shaving	14
is	14
not	14
everything,	14
and	14
there	14
is	14
some	14
difference	14
between	14
Peter	14
and	14
Peter.	14
I	14
say	14
this	14
because	14
we	14
all	14
know	14
one	14
another,	14
and	14
it	14
will	14
not	14
do	14
to	14
throw	14
false	14
dice	14
with	14
me;	14
and	14
as	14
to	14
the	14
enchantment	14
of	14
my	14
master,	14
God	14
knows	14
the	14
truth;	14
leave	14
it	14
as	14
it	14
is;	14
it	14
only	14
makes	14
it	14
worse	14
to	14
stir	14
it.”	14
The	14
barber	14
did	14
not	14
care	14
to	14
answer	14
Sancho	14
lest	14
by	14
his	14
plain	14
speaking	14
he	14
should	14
disclose	14
what	14
the	14
curate	14
and	14
he	14
himself	14
were	14
trying	14
so	14
hard	14
to	14
conceal;	14
and	14
under	14
the	14
same	14
apprehension	14
the	14
curate	14
had	14
asked	14
the	14
canon	14
to	14
ride	14
on	14
a	14
little	14
in	14
advance,	14
so	14
that	14
he	14
might	14
tell	14
him	14
the	14
mystery	14
of	14
this	14
man	14
in	14
the	14
cage,	14
and	14
other	14
things	14
that	14
would	14
amuse	14
him.	14
The	14
canon	14
agreed,	14
and	14
going	14
on	14
ahead	14
with	14
his	14
servants,	14
listened	14
with	14
attention	14
to	14
the	14
account	14
of	14
the	14
character,	14
life,	14
madness,	14
and	14
ways	14
of	14
Don	14
Quixote,	14
given	14
him	14
by	14
the	14
curate,	14
who	14
described	14
to	14
him	14
briefly	14
the	14
beginning	14
and	14
origin	14
of	14
his	14
craze,	14
and	14
told	14
him	14
the	14
whole	14
story	14
of	14
his	14
adventures	14
up	14
to	14
his	14
being	14
confined	14
in	14
the	14
cage,	14
together	14
with	14
the	14
plan	14
they	14
had	14
of	14
taking	14
him	14
home	14
to	14
try	14
if	14
by	14
any	14
means	14
they	14
could	14
discover	14
a	14
cure	14
for	14
his	14
madness.	14
The	14
canon	14
and	14
his	14
servants	14
were	14
surprised	14
anew	14
when	14
they	14
heard	14
Don	14
Quixote’s	14
strange	14
story,	14
and	14
when	14
it	14
was	14
finished	14
he	14
said,	14
“To	14
tell	14
the	14
truth,	14
señor	14
curate,	14
I	14
for	14
my	14
part	14
consider	14
what	14
they	14
call	14
books	14
of	14
chivalry	14
to	14
be	14
mischievous	14
to	14
the	14
State;	14
and	14
though,	14
led	14
by	14
idle	14
and	14
false	14
taste,	14
I	14
have	14
read	14
the	14
beginnings	14
of	14
almost	14
all	14
that	14
have	14
been	14
printed,	14
I	14
never	14
could	14
manage	14
to	14
read	14
any	14
one	14
of	14
them	14
from	14
beginning	14
to	14
end;	14
for	14
it	14
seems	14
to	14
me	14
they	14
are	14
all	14
more	14
or	14
less	14
the	14
same	14
thing;	14
and	14
one	14
has	14
nothing	14
more	14
in	14
it	14
than	14
another;	14
this	14
no	14
more	14
than	14
that.	14
And	14
in	14
my	14
opinion	14
this	14
sort	14
of	14
writing	14
and	14
composition	14
is	14
of	14
the	14
same	14
species	14
as	14
the	14
fables	14
they	14
call	14
the	14
Milesian,	14
nonsensical	14
tales	14
that	14
aim	14
solely	14
at	14
giving	14
amusement	14
and	14
not	14
instruction,	14
exactly	14
the	14
opposite	14
of	14
the	14
apologue	14
fables	14
which	14
amuse	14
and	14
instruct	14
at	14
the	14
same	14
time.	14
And	14
though	14
it	14
may	14
be	14
the	14
chief	14
object	14
of	14
such	14
books	14
to	14
amuse,	14
I	14
do	14
not	14
know	14
how	14
they	14
can	14
succeed,	14
when	14
they	14
are	14
so	14
full	14
of	14
such	14
monstrous	14
nonsense.	14
For	14
the	14
enjoyment	14
the	14
mind	14
feels	14
must	14
come	14
from	14
the	14
beauty	14
and	14
harmony	14
which	14
it	14
perceives	14
or	14
contemplates	14
in	14
the	14
things	14
that	14
the	14
eye	14
or	14
the	14
imagination	14
brings	14
before	14
it;	14
and	14
nothing	14
that	14
has	14
any	14
ugliness	14
or	14
disproportion	14
about	14
it	14
can	14
give	14
any	14
pleasure.	14
What	14
beauty,	14
then,	14
or	14
what	14
proportion	14
of	14
the	14
parts	14
to	14
the	14
whole,	14
or	14
of	14
the	14
whole	14
to	14
the	14
parts,	14
can	14
there	14
be	14
in	14
a	14
book	14
or	14
fable	14
where	14
a	14
lad	14
of	14
sixteen	14
cuts	14
down	14
a	14
giant	14
as	14
tall	14
as	14
a	14
tower	14
and	14
makes	14
two	14
halves	14
of	14
him	14
as	14
if	14
he	14
was	14
an	14
almond	14
cake?	14
And	14
when	14
they	14
want	14
to	14
give	14
us	14
a	14
picture	14
of	14
a	14
battle,	14
after	14
having	14
told	14
us	14
that	14
there	14
are	14
a	14
million	14
of	14
combatants	14
on	14
the	14
side	14
of	14
the	14
enemy,	14
let	14
the	14
hero	14
of	14
the	14
book	14
be	14
opposed	14
to	14
them,	14
and	14
we	14
have	14
perforce	14
to	14
believe,	14
whether	14
we	14
like	14
it	14
or	14
not,	14
that	14
the	14
said	14
knight	14
wins	14
the	14
victory	14
by	14
the	14
single	14
might	14
of	14
his	14
strong	14
arm.	14
And	14
then,	14
what	14
shall	14
we	14
say	14
of	14
the	14
facility	14
with	14
which	14
a	14
born	14
queen	14
or	14
empress	14
will	14
give	14
herself	14
over	14
into	14
the	14
arms	14
of	14
some	14
unknown	14
wandering	14
knight?	14
What	14
mind,	14
that	14
is	14
not	14
wholly	14
barbarous	14
and	14
uncultured,	14
can	14
find	14
pleasure	14
in	14
reading	14
of	14
how	14
a	14
great	14
tower	14
full	14
of	14
knights	14
sails	14
away	14
across	14
the	14
sea	14
like	14
a	14
ship	14
with	14
a	14
fair	14
wind,	14
and	14
will	14
be	14
to-night	14
in	14
Lombardy	14
and	14
to-morrow	14
morning	14
in	14
the	14
land	14
of	14
Prester	14
John	14
of	14
the	14
Indies,	14
or	14
some	14
other	14
that	14
Ptolemy	14
never	14
described	14
nor	14
Marco	14
Polo	14
saw?	14
And	14
if,	14
in	14
answer	14
to	14
this,	14
I	14
am	14
told	14
that	14
the	14
authors	14
of	14
books	14
of	14
the	14
kind	14
write	14
them	14
as	14
fiction,	14
and	14
therefore	14
are	14
not	14
bound	14
to	14
regard	14
niceties	14
of	14
truth,	14
I	14
would	14
reply	14
that	14
fiction	14
is	14
all	14
the	14
better	14
the	14
more	14
it	14
looks	14
like	14
truth,	14
and	14
gives	14
the	14
more	14
pleasure	14
the	14
more	14
probability	14
and	14
possibility	14
there	14
is	14
about	14
it.	14
Plots	14
in	14
fiction	14
should	14
be	14
wedded	14
to	14
the	14
understanding	14
of	14
the	14
reader,	14
and	14
be	14
constructed	14
in	14
such	14
a	14
way	14
that,	14
reconciling	14
impossibilities,	14
smoothing	14
over	14
difficulties,	14
keeping	14
the	14
mind	14
on	14
the	14
alert,	14
they	14
may	14
surprise,	14
interest,	14
divert,	14
and	14
entertain,	14
so	14
that	14
wonder	14
and	14
delight	14
joined	14
may	14
keep	14
pace	14
one	14
with	14
the	14
other;	14
all	14
which	14
he	14
will	14
fail	14
to	14
effect	14
who	14
shuns	14
verisimilitude	14
and	14
truth	14
to	14
nature,	14
wherein	14
lies	14
the	14
perfection	14
of	14
writing.	14
I	14
have	14
never	14
yet	14
seen	14
any	14
book	14
of	14
chivalry	14
that	14
puts	14
together	14
a	14
connected	14
plot	14
complete	14
in	14
all	14
its	14
numbers,	14
so	14
that	14
the	14
middle	14
agrees	14
with	14
the	14
beginning,	14
and	14
the	14
end	14
with	14
the	14
beginning	14
and	14
middle;	14
on	14
the	14
contrary,	14
they	14
construct	14
them	14
with	14
such	14
a	14
multitude	14
of	14
members	14
that	14
it	14
seems	14
as	14
though	14
they	14
meant	14
to	14
produce	14
a	14
chimera	14
or	14
monster	14
rather	14
than	14
a	14
well-proportioned	14
figure.	14
And	14
besides	14
all	14
this	14
they	14
are	14
harsh	14
in	14
their	14
style,	14
incredible	14
in	14
their	14
achievements,	14
licentious	14
in	14
their	14
amours,	14
uncouth	14
in	14
their	14
courtly	14
speeches,	14
prolix	14
in	14
their	14
battles,	14
silly	14
in	14
their	14
arguments,	14
absurd	14
in	14
their	14
travels,	14
and,	14
in	14
short,	14
wanting	14
in	14
everything	14
like	14
intelligent	14
art;	14
for	14
which	14
reason	14
they	14
deserve	14
to	14
be	14
banished	14
from	14
the	14
Christian	14
commonwealth	14
as	14
a	14
worthless	14
breed.”	14

The	14
curate	14
listened	14
to	14
him	14
attentively	14
and	14
felt	14
that	14
he	14
was	14
a	14
man	14
of	14
sound	14
understanding,	14
and	14
that	14
there	14
was	14
good	14
reason	14
in	14
what	14
he	14
said;	14
so	14
he	14
told	14
him	14
that,	14
being	14
of	14
the	14
same	14
opinion	14
himself,	14
and	14
bearing	14
a	14
grudge	14
to	14
books	14
of	14
chivalry,	14
he	14
had	14
burned	14
all	14
Don	14
Quixote’s,	14
which	14
were	14
many;	14
and	14
gave	14
him	14
an	14
account	14
of	14
the	14
scrutiny	14
he	14
had	14
made	14
of	14
them,	14
and	14
of	14
those	14
he	14
had	14
condemned	14
to	14
the	14
flames	14
and	14
those	14
he	14
had	14
spared,	14
with	14
which	14
the	14
canon	14
was	14
not	14
a	14
little	14
amused,	14
adding	14
that	14
though	14
he	14
had	14
said	14
so	14
much	14
in	14
condemnation	14
of	14
these	14
books,	14
still	14
he	14
found	14
one	14
good	14
thing	14
in	14
them,	14
and	14
that	14
was	14
the	14
opportunity	14
they	14
afforded	14
to	14
a	14
gifted	14
intellect	14
for	14
displaying	14
itself;	14
for	14
they	14
presented	14
a	14
wide	14
and	14
spacious	14
field	14
over	14
which	14
the	14
pen	14
might	14
range	14
freely,	14
describing	14
shipwrecks,	14
tempests,	14
combats,	14
battles,	14
portraying	14
a	14
valiant	14
captain	14
with	14
all	14
the	14
qualifications	14
requisite	14
to	14
make	14
one,	14
showing	14
him	14
sagacious	14
in	14
foreseeing	14
the	14
wiles	14
of	14
the	14
enemy,	14
eloquent	14
in	14
speech	14
to	14
encourage	14
or	14
restrain	14
his	14
soldiers,	14
ripe	14
in	14
counsel,	14
rapid	14
in	14
resolve,	14
as	14
bold	14
in	14
biding	14
his	14
time	14
as	14
in	14
pressing	14
the	14
attack;	14
now	14
picturing	14
some	14
sad	14
tragic	14
incident,	14
now	14
some	14
joyful	14
and	14
unexpected	14
event;	14
here	14
a	14
beauteous	14
lady,	14
virtuous,	14
wise,	14
and	14
modest;	14
there	14
a	14
Christian	14
knight,	14
brave	14
and	14
gentle;	14
here	14
a	14
lawless,	14
barbarous	14
braggart;	14
there	14
a	14
courteous	14
prince,	14
gallant	14
and	14
gracious;	14
setting	14
forth	14
the	14
devotion	14
and	14
loyalty	14
of	14
vassals,	14
the	14
greatness	14
and	14
generosity	14
of	14
nobles.	14
“Or	14
again,”	14
said	14
he,	14

sometimes	14

have	14
a	14
chance	14
of	14
coming	14
forward	14
as	14
a	14

if	14
he	14
likes.	14
He	14
can	14

forth	14

at	14
the	14
truth	14
as	14
much	14
as	14
possible,	14
he	14
will	14
assuredly	14
weave	14
a	14
web	14
of	14
bright	14
and	14
varied	14
threads	14
that,	14
when	14
finished,	14
will	14
display	14
such	14
perfection	14
and	14
beauty	14
that	14
it	14
will	14
attain	14
the	14
worthiest	14
object	14
any	14
writing	14
can	14
seek,	14
which,	14
as	14
I	14
said	14
before,	14
is	14
to	14
give	14
instruction	14
and	14
pleasure	14
combined;	14
for	14
the	14
unrestricted	14
range	14
of	14
these	14
books	14
enables	14
the	14
author	14
to	14
show	14
his	14
powers,	14
epic,	14
lyric,	14
tragic,	14
or	14
comic,	14
and	14
all	14
the	14
moods	14
the	14
sweet	14
and	14
winning	14
arts	14
of	14
poesy	14
and	14
oratory	14
are	14
capable	14
of;	14
for	14
the	14
epic	14
may	14
be	14
written	14
in	14
prose	14
just	14
as	14
well	14
as	14
in	14
verse.”	14

“It	14
is	14
as	14
you	14
say,	14
señor	14
canon,”	14
said	14
the	14
curate;	14
“and	14
for	14
that	14
reason	14
those	14
who	14
have	14
hitherto	14
written	14
books	14
of	14
the	14
sort	14
deserve	14
all	14
the	14
more	14
censure	14
for	14
writing	14
without	14
paying	14
any	14
attention	14
to	14
good	14
taste	14
or	14
the	14
rules	14
of	14
art,	14
by	14
which	14
they	14
might	14
guide	14
themselves	14
and	14
become	14
as	14
famous	14
in	14
prose	14
as	14
the	14
two	14
princes	14
of	14
Greek	14
and	14
Latin	14
poetry	14
are	14
in	14
verse.”	14
“I	14
myself,	14
at	14
any	14
rate,”	14
said	14
the	14
canon,	14
“was	14
once	14
tempted	14
to	14
write	14
a	14
book	14
of	14
chivalry	14
in	14
which	14
all	14
the	14
points	14
I	14
have	14
mentioned	14
were	14
to	14
be	14
observed;	14
and	14
if	14
I	14
must	14
own	14
the	14
truth	14
I	14
have	14
more	14
than	14
a	14
hundred	14
sheets	14
written;	14
and	14
to	14
try	14
if	14
it	14
came	14
up	14
to	14
my	14
own	14
opinion	14
of	14
it,	14
I	14
showed	14
them	14
to	14
persons	14
who	14
were	14
fond	14
of	14
this	14
kind	14
of	14
reading,	14
to	14
learned	14
and	14
intelligent	14
men	14
as	14
well	14
as	14
to	14
ignorant	14
people	14
who	14
cared	14
for	14
nothing	14
but	14
the	14
pleasure	14
of	14
listening	14
to	14
nonsense,	14
and	14
from	14
all	14
I	14
obtained	14
flattering	14
approval;	14
nevertheless	14
I	14
proceeded	14
no	14
farther	14
with	14
it,	14
as	14
well	14
because	14
it	14
seemed	14
to	14
me	14
an	14
occupation	14
inconsistent	14
with	14
my	14
profession,	14
as	14
because	14
I	14
perceived	14
that	14
the	14
fools	14
are	14
more	14
numerous	14
than	14
the	14
wise;	14
and,	14
though	14
it	14
is	14
better	14
to	14
be	14
praised	14
by	14
the	14
wise	14
few	14
than	14
applauded	14
by	14
the	14
foolish	14
many,	14
I	14
have	14
no	14
mind	14
to	14
submit	14
myself	14
to	14
the	14
stupid	14
judgment	14
of	14
the	14
silly	14
public,	14
to	14
whom	14
the	14
reading	14
of	14
such	14
books	14
falls	14
for	14
the	14
most	14
part.	14
“But	14
what	14
most	14
of	14
all	14
made	14
me	14
hold	14
my	14
hand	14
and	14
even	14
abandon	14
all	14
idea	14
of	14
finishing	14
it	14
was	14
an	14
argument	14
I	14
put	14
to	14
myself	14
taken	14
from	14
the	14
plays	14
that	14
are	14
acted	14
now-a-days,	14
which	14
was	14
in	14
this	14
wise:	14
if	14
those	14
that	14
are	14
now	14
in	14
vogue,	14
as	14
well	14
those	14
that	14
are	14
pure	14
invention	14
as	14
those	14
founded	14
on	14
history,	14
are,	14
all	14
or	14
most	14
of	14
them,	14
downright	14
nonsense	14
and	14
things	14
that	14
have	14
neither	14
head	14
nor	14
tail,	14
and	14
yet	14
the	14
public	14
listens	14
to	14
them	14
with	14
delight,	14
and	14
regards	14
and	14
cries	14
them	14
up	14
as	14
perfection	14
when	14
they	14
are	14
so	14
far	14
from	14
it;	14
and	14
if	14
the	14
authors	14
who	14
write	14
them,	14
and	14
the	14
players	14
who	14
act	14
them,	14
say	14
that	14
this	14
is	14
what	14
they	14
must	14
be,	14
for	14
the	14
public	14
wants	14
this	14
and	14
will	14
have	14
nothing	14
else;	14
and	14
that	14
those	14
that	14
go	14
by	14
rule	14
and	14
work	14
out	14
a	14
plot	14
according	14
to	14
the	14
laws	14
of	14
art	14
will	14
only	14
find	14
some	14
half-dozen	14
intelligent	14
people	14
to	14
understand	14
them,	14
while	14
all	14
the	14
rest	14
remain	14
blind	14
to	14
the	14
merit	14
of	14
their	14
composition;	14
and	14
that	14
for	14
themselves	14
it	14
is	14
better	14
to	14
get	14
bread	14
from	14
the	14
many	14
than	14
praise	14
from	14
the	14
few;	14
then	14
my	14
book	14
will	14
fare	14
the	14
same	14
way,	14
after	14
I	14
have	14
burnt	14
off	14
my	14
eyebrows	14
in	14
trying	14
to	14
observe	14
the	14
principles	14
I	14
have	14
spoken	14
of,	14
and	14
I	14
shall	14
be	14
‘the	14
tailor	14
of	14
the	14
corner.’	14
And	14
though	14
I	14
have	14
sometimes	14
endeavoured	14
to	14
convince	14
actors	14
that	14
they	14
are	14
mistaken	14
in	14
this	14
notion	14
they	14
have	14
adopted,	14
and	14
that	14
they	14
would	14
attract	14
more	14
people,	14
and	14
get	14
more	14
credit,	14
by	14
producing	14
plays	14
in	14
accordance	14
with	14
the	14
rules	14
of	14
art,	14
than	14
by	14
absurd	14
ones,	14
they	14
are	14
so	14
thoroughly	14
wedded	14
to	14
their	14
own	14
opinion	14
that	14
no	14
argument	14
or	14
evidence	14
can	14
wean	14
them	14
from	14
it.	14
“I	14
remember	14
saying	14
one	14
day	14
to	14
one	14
of	14
these	14
obstinate	14
fellows,	14
‘Tell	14
me,	14
do	14
you	14
not	14
recollect	14
that	14
a	14
few	14
years	14
ago,	14
there	14
were	14
three	14
tragedies	14
acted	14
in	14
Spain,	14
written	14
by	14
a	14
famous	14
poet	14
of	14
these	14
kingdoms,	14
which	14
were	14
such	14
that	14
they	14
filled	14
all	14
who	14
heard	14
them	14
with	14
admiration,	14
delight,	14
and	14
interest,	14
the	14
ignorant	14
as	14
well	14
as	14
the	14
wise,	14
the	14
masses	14
as	14
well	14
as	14
the	14
higher	14
orders,	14
and	14
brought	14
in	14
more	14
money	14
to	14
the	14
performers,	14
these	14
three	14
alone,	14
than	14
thirty	14
of	14
the	14
best	14
that	14
have	14
been	14
since	14
produced?’	14
“‘No	14
doubt,’	14
replied	14
the	14
actor	14
in	14
question,	14
‘you	14
mean	14
the	14
“Isabella,”	14
the	14
“Phyllis,”	14
and	14
the	14
“Alexandra.”’	14
“‘Those	14
are	14
the	14
ones	14
I	14
mean,’	14
said	14
I;	14
‘and	14
see	14
if	14
they	14
did	14
not	14
observe	14
the	14
principles	14
of	14
art,	14
and	14
if,	14
by	14
observing	14
them,	14
they	14
failed	14
to	14
show	14
their	14
superiority	14
and	14
please	14
all	14
the	14
world;	14
so	14
that	14
the	14
fault	14
does	14
not	14
lie	14
with	14
the	14
public	14
that	14
insists	14
upon	14
nonsense,	14
but	14
with	14
those	14
who	14
don’t	14
know	14
how	14
to	14
produce	14
something	14
else.	14
“The	14
Ingratitude	14
Revenged”	14
was	14
not	14
nonsense,	14
nor	14
was	14
there	14
any	14
in	14
“The	14
Numantia,”	14
nor	14
any	14
to	14
be	14
found	14
in	14
“The	14
Merchant	14
Lover,”	14
nor	14
yet	14
in	14
“The	14
Friendly	14
Fair	14
Foe,”	14
nor	14
in	14
some	14
others	14
that	14
have	14
been	14
written	14
by	14
certain	14
gifted	14
poets,	14
to	14
their	14
own	14
fame	14
and	14
renown,	14
and	14
to	14
the	14
profit	14
of	14
those	14
that	14
brought	14
them	14
out;’	14
some	14
further	14
remarks	14
I	14
added	14
to	14
these,	14
with	14
which,	14
I	14
think,	14
I	14
left	14
him	14
rather	14
dumbfoundered,	14
but	14
not	14
so	14
satisfied	14
or	14
convinced	14
that	14
I	14
could	14
disabuse	14
him	14
of	14
his	14
error.”	14
“You	14
have	14
touched	14
upon	14
a	14
subject,	14
señor	14
canon,”	14
observed	14
the	14
curate	14
here,	14
“that	14
has	14
awakened	14
an	14
old	14
enmity	14
I	14
have	14
against	14
the	14
plays	14
in	14
vogue	14
at	14
the	14
present	14
day,	14
quite	14
as	14
strong	14
as	14
that	14
which	14
I	14
bear	14
to	14
the	14
books	14
of	14
chivalry;	14
for	14
while	14
the	14
drama,	14
according	14
to	14
Tully,	14
should	14
be	14
the	14
mirror	14
of	14
human	14
life,	14
the	14
model	14
of	14
manners,	14
and	14
the	14
image	14
of	14
the	14
truth,	14
those	14
which	14
are	14
presented	14
now-a-days	14
are	14
mirrors	14
of	14
nonsense,	14
models	14
of	14
folly,	14
and	14
images	14
of	14
lewdness.	14
For	14
what	14
greater	14
nonsense	14
can	14
there	14
be	14
in	14
connection	14
with	14
what	14
we	14
are	14
now	14
discussing	14
than	14
for	14
an	14
infant	14
to	14
appear	14
in	14
swaddling	14
clothes	14
in	14
the	14
first	14
scene	14
of	14
the	14
first	14
act,	14
and	14
in	14
the	14
second	14
a	14
grown-up	14
bearded	14
man?	14
Or	14
what	14
greater	14
absurdity	14
can	14
there	14
be	14
than	14
putting	14
before	14
us	14
an	14
old	14
man	14
as	14
a	14
swashbuckler,	14
a	14
young	14
man	14
as	14
a	14
poltroon,	14
a	14
lackey	14
using	14
fine	14
language,	14
a	14
page	14
giving	14
sage	14
advice,	14
a	14
king	14
plying	14
as	14
a	14
porter,	14
a	14
princess	14
who	14
is	14
a	14
kitchen-maid?	14
And	14
then	14
what	14
shall	14
I	14
say	14
of	14
their	14
attention	14
to	14
the	14
time	14
in	14
which	14
the	14
action	14
they	14
represent	14
may	14
or	14
can	14
take	14
place,	14
save	14
that	14
I	14
have	14
seen	14
a	14
play	14
where	14
the	14
first	14
act	14
began	14
in	14
Europe,	14
the	14
second	14
in	14
Asia,	14
the	14
third	14
finished	14
in	14
Africa,	14
and	14
no	14
doubt,	14
had	14
it	14
been	14
in	14
four	14
acts,	14
the	14
fourth	14
would	14
have	14
ended	14
in	14
America,	14
and	14
so	14
it	14
would	14
have	14
been	14
laid	14
in	14
all	14
four	14
quarters	14
of	14
the	14
globe?	14
And	14
if	14
truth	14
to	14
life	14
is	14
the	14
main	14
thing	14
the	14
drama	14
should	14
keep	14
in	14
view,	14
how	14
is	14
it	14
possible	14
for	14
any	14
average	14
understanding	14
to	14
be	14
satisfied	14
when	14
the	14
action	14
is	14
supposed	14
to	14
pass	14
in	14
the	14
time	14
of	14
King	14
Pepin	14
or	14
Charlemagne,	14
and	14
the	14
principal	14
personage	14
in	14
it	14
they	14
represent	14
to	14
be	14
the	14
Emperor	14
Heraclius	14
who	14
entered	14
Jerusalem	14
with	14
the	14
cross	14
and	14
won	14
the	14
Holy	14
Sepulchre,	14
like	14
Godfrey	14
of	14
Bouillon,	14
there	14
being	14
years	14
innumerable	14
between	14
the	14
one	14
and	14
the	14
other?	14
or,	14
if	14
the	14
play	14
is	14
based	14
on	14
fiction	14
and	14
historical	14
facts	14
are	14
introduced,	14
or	14
bits	14
of	14
what	14
occurred	14
to	14
different	14
people	14
and	14
at	14
different	14
times	14
mixed	14
up	14
with	14
it,	14
all,	14
not	14
only	14
without	14
any	14
semblance	14
of	14
probability,	14
but	14
with	14
obvious	14
errors	14
that	14
from	14
every	14
point	14
of	14
view	14
are	14
inexcusable?	14
And	14
the	14
worst	14
of	14
it	14
is,	14
there	14
are	14
ignorant	14
people	14
who	14
say	14
that	14
this	14
is	14
perfection,	14
and	14
that	14
anything	14
beyond	14
this	14
is	14
affected	14
refinement.	14
And	14
then	14
if	14
we	14
turn	14
to	14
sacred	14
dramas—what	14
miracles	14
they	14
invent	14
in	14
them!	14
What	14
apocryphal,	14
ill-devised	14
incidents,	14
attributing	14
to	14
one	14
saint	14
the	14
miracles	14
of	14
another!	14
And	14
even	14
in	14
secular	14
plays	14
they	14
venture	14
to	14
introduce	14
miracles	14
without	14
any	14
reason	14
or	14
object	14
except	14
that	14
they	14
think	14
some	14
such	14
miracle,	14
or	14
transformation	14
as	14
they	14
call	14
it,	14
will	14
come	14
in	14
well	14
to	14
astonish	14
stupid	14
people	14
and	14
draw	14
them	14
to	14
the	14
play.	14
All	14
this	14
tends	14
to	14
the	14
prejudice	14
of	14
the	14
truth	14
and	14
the	14
corruption	14
of	14
history,	14
nay	14
more,	14
to	14
the	14
reproach	14
of	14
the	14
wits	14
of	14
Spain;	14
for	14
foreigners	14
who	14
scrupulously	14
observe	14
the	14
laws	14
of	14
the	14
drama	14
look	14
upon	14
us	14
as	14
barbarous	14
and	14
ignorant,	14
when	14
they	14
see	14
the	14
absurdity	14
and	14
nonsense	14
of	14
the	14
plays	14
we	14
produce.	14
Nor	14
will	14
it	14
be	14
a	14
sufficient	14
excuse	14
to	14
say	14
that	14
the	14
chief	14
object	14
well-ordered	14
governments	14
have	14
in	14
view	14
when	14
they	14
permit	14
plays	14
to	14
be	14
performed	14
in	14
public	14
is	14
to	14
entertain	14
the	14
people	14
with	14
some	14
harmless	14
amusement	14
occasionally,	14
and	14
keep	14
it	14
from	14
those	14
evil	14
humours	14
which	14
idleness	14
is	14
apt	14
to	14
engender;	14
and	14
that,	14
as	14
this	14
may	14
be	14
attained	14
by	14
any	14
sort	14
of	14
play,	14
good	14
or	14
bad,	14
there	14
is	14
no	14
need	14
to	14
lay	14
down	14
laws,	14
or	14
bind	14
those	14
who	14
write	14
or	14
act	14
them	14
to	14
make	14
them	14
as	14
they	14
ought	14
to	14
be	14
made,	14
since,	14
as	14
I	14
say,	14
the	14
object	14
sought	14
for	14
may	14
be	14
secured	14
by	14
any	14
sort.	14
To	14
this	14
I	14
would	14
reply	14
that	14
the	14
same	14
end	14
would	14
be,	14
beyond	14
all	14
comparison,	14
better	14
attained	14
by	14
means	14
of	14
good	14
plays	14
than	14
by	14
those	14
that	14
are	14
not	14
so;	14
for	14
after	14
listening	14
to	14
an	14
artistic	14
and	14
properly	14
constructed	14
play,	14
the	14
hearer	14
will	14
come	14
away	14
enlivened	14
by	14
the	14
jests,	14
instructed	14
by	14
the	14
serious	14
parts,	14
full	14
of	14
admiration	14
at	14
the	14
incidents,	14
his	14
wits	14
sharpened	14
by	14
the	14
arguments,	14
warned	14
by	14
the	14
tricks,	14
all	14
the	14
wiser	14
for	14
the	14
examples,	14
inflamed	14
against	14
vice,	14
and	14
in	14
love	14
with	14
virtue;	14
for	14
in	14
all	14
these	14
ways	14
a	14
good	14
play	14
will	14
stimulate	14
the	14
mind	14
of	14
the	14
hearer	14
be	14
he	14
ever	14
so	14
boorish	14
or	14
dull;	14
and	14
of	14
all	14
impossibilities	14
the	14
greatest	14
is	14
that	14
a	14
play	14
endowed	14
with	14
all	14
these	14
qualities	14
will	14
not	14
entertain,	14
satisfy,	14
and	14
please	14
much	14
more	14
than	14
one	14
wanting	14
in	14
them,	14
like	14
the	14
greater	14
number	14
of	14
those	14
which	14
are	14
commonly	14
acted	14
now-a-days.	14
Nor	14
are	14
the	14
poets	14
who	14
write	14
them	14
to	14
be	14
blamed	14
for	14
this;	14
for	14
some	14
there	14
are	14
among	14
them	14
who	14
are	14
perfectly	14
well	14
aware	14
of	14
their	14
faults,	14
and	14
know	14
what	14
they	14
ought	14
to	14
do;	14
but	14
as	14
plays	14
have	14
become	14
a	14
salable	14
commodity,	14
they	14
say,	14
and	14
with	14
truth,	14
that	14
the	14
actors	14
will	14
not	14
buy	14
them	14
unless	14
they	14
are	14
after	14
this	14
fashion;	14
and	14
so	14
the	14
poet	14
tries	14
to	14
adapt	14
himself	14
to	14
the	14
requirements	14
of	14
the	14
actor	14
who	14
is	14
to	14
pay	14
him	14
for	14
his	14
work.	14
And	14
that	14
this	14
is	14
the	14
truth	14
may	14
be	14
seen	14
by	14
the	14
countless	14
plays	14
that	14
a	14
most	14
fertile	14
wit	14
of	14
these	14
kingdoms	14
has	14
written,	14
with	14
so	14
much	14
brilliancy,	14
so	14
much	14
grace	14
and	14
gaiety,	14
such	14
polished	14
versification,	14
such	14
choice	14
language,	14
such	14
profound	14
reflections,	14
and	14
in	14
a	14
word,	14
so	14
rich	14
in	14
eloquence	14
and	14
elevation	14
of	14
style,	14
that	14
he	14
has	14
filled	14
the	14
world	14
with	14
his	14
fame;	14
and	14
yet,	14
in	14
consequence	14
of	14
his	14
desire	14
to	14
suit	14
the	14
taste	14
of	14
the	14
actors,	14
they	14
have	14
not	14
all,	14
as	14
some	14
of	14
them	14
have,	14
come	14
as	14
near	14
perfection	14
as	14
they	14
ought.	14
Others	14
write	14
plays	14
with	14
such	14
heedlessness	14
that,	14
after	14
they	14
have	14
been	14
acted,	14
the	14
actors	14
have	14
to	14
fly	14
and	14
abscond,	14
afraid	14
of	14
being	14
punished,	14
as	14
they	14
often	14
have	14
been,	14
for	14
having	14
acted	14
something	14
offensive	14
to	14
some	14
king	14
or	14
other,	14
or	14
insulting	14
to	14
some	14
noble	14
family.	14
All	14
which	14
evils,	14
and	14
many	14
more	14
that	14
I	14
say	14
nothing	14
of,	14
would	14
be	14
removed	14
if	14
there	14
were	14
some	14
intelligent	14
and	14
sensible	14
person	14
at	14
the	14
capital	14
to	14
examine	14
all	14
plays	14
before	14
they	14
were	14
acted,	14
not	14
only	14
those	14
produced	14
in	14
the	14
capital	14
itself,	14
but	14
all	14
that	14
were	14
intended	14
to	14
be	14
acted	14
in	14
Spain;	14
without	14
whose	14
approval,	14
seal,	14
and	14
signature,	14
no	14
local	14
magistracy	14
should	14
allow	14
any	14
play	14
to	14
be	14
acted.	14
In	14
that	14
case	14
actors	14
would	14
take	14
care	14
to	14
send	14
their	14
plays	14
to	14
the	14
capital,	14
and	14
could	14
act	14
them	14
in	14
safety,	14
and	14
those	14
who	14
write	14
them	14
would	14
be	14
more	14
careful	14
and	14
take	14
more	14
pains	14
with	14
their	14
work,	14
standing	14
in	14
awe	14
of	14
having	14
to	14
submit	14
it	14
to	14
the	14
strict	14
examination	14
of	14
one	14
who	14
understood	14
the	14
matter;	14
and	14
so	14
good	14
plays	14
would	14
be	14
produced	14
and	14
the	14
objects	14
they	14
aim	14
at	14
happily	14
attained;	14
as	14
well	14
the	14
amusement	14
of	14
the	14
people,	14
as	14
the	14
credit	14
of	14
the	14
wits	14
of	14
Spain,	14
the	14
interest	14
and	14
safety	14
of	14
the	14
actors,	14
and	14
the	14
saving	14
of	14
trouble	14
in	14
inflicting	14
punishment	14
on	14
them.	14
And	14
if	14
the	14
same	14
or	14
some	14
other	14
person	14
were	14
authorised	14
to	14
examine	14
the	14
newly	14
written	14
books	14
of	14
chivalry,	14
no	14
doubt	14
some	14
would	14
appear	14
with	14
all	14
the	14
perfections	14
you	14
have	14
described,	14
enriching	14
our	14
language	14
with	14
the	14
gracious	14
and	14
precious	14
treasure	14
of	14
eloquence,	14
and	14
driving	14
the	14
old	14
books	14
into	14
obscurity	14
before	14
the	14
light	14
of	14
the	14
new	14
ones	14
that	14
would	14
come	14
out	14
for	14
the	14
harmless	14
entertainment,	14
not	14
merely	14
of	14
the	14
idle	14
but	14
of	14
the	14
very	14
busiest;	14
for	14
the	14
bow	14
cannot	14
be	14
always	14
bent,	14
nor	14
can	14
weak	14
human	14
nature	14
exist	14
without	14
some	14
lawful	14
amusement.”	14
The	14
canon	14
and	14
the	14
curate	14
had	14
proceeded	14
thus	14
far	14
with	14
their	14
conversation,	14
when	14
the	14
barber,	14
coming	14
forward,	14
joined	14
them,	14
and	14
said	14
to	14
the	14
curate,	14
“This	14
is	14
the	14
spot,	14
señor	14
licentiate,	14
that	14
I	14
said	14
was	14
a	14
good	14
one	14
for	14
fresh	14
and	14
plentiful	14
pasture	14
for	14
the	14
oxen,	14
while	14
we	14
take	14
our	14
noontide	14
rest.”	14
“And	14
so	14
it	14
seems,”	14
returned	14
the	14
curate,	14
and	14
he	14
told	14
the	14
canon	14
what	14
he	14
proposed	14
to	14
do,	14
on	14
which	14
he	14
too	14
made	14
up	14
his	14
mind	14
to	14
halt	14
with	14
them,	14
attracted	14
by	14
the	14
aspect	14
of	14
the	14
fair	14
valley	14
that	14
lay	14
before	14
their	14
eyes;	14
and	14
to	14
enjoy	14
it	14
as	14
well	14
as	14
the	14
conversation	14
of	14
the	14
curate,	14
to	14
whom	14
he	14
had	14
begun	14
to	14
take	14
a	14
fancy,	14
and	14
also	14
to	14
learn	14
more	14
particulars	14
about	14
the	14
doings	14
of	14
Don	14
Quixote,	14
he	14
desired	14
some	14
of	14
his	14
servants	14
to	14
go	14
on	14
to	14
the	14
inn,	14
which	14
was	14
not	14
far	14
distant,	14
and	14
fetch	14
from	14
it	14
what	14
eatables	14
there	14
might	14
be	14
for	14
the	14
whole	14
party,	14
as	14
he	14
meant	14
to	14
rest	14
for	14
the	14
afternoon	14
where	14
he	14
was;	14
to	14
which	14
one	14
of	14
his	14
servants	14
replied	14
that	14
the	14
sumpter	14
mule,	14
which	14
by	14
this	14
time	14
ought	14
to	14
have	14
reached	14
the	14
inn,	14
carried	14
provisions	14
enough	14
to	14
make	14
it	14
unnecessary	14
to	14
get	14
anything	14
from	14
the	14
inn	14
except	14
barley.	14
“In	14
that	14
case,”	14
said	14
the	14
canon,	14
“take	14
all	14
the	14
beasts	14
there,	14
and	14
bring	14
the	14
sumpter	14
mule	14
back.”	14
While	14
this	14
was	14
going	14
on,	14
Sancho,	14
perceiving	14
that	14
he	14
could	14
speak	14
to	14
his	14
master	14
without	14
having	14
the	14
curate	14
and	14
the	14
barber,	14
of	14
whom	14
he	14
had	14
his	14
suspicions,	14
present	14
all	14
the	14
time,	14
approached	14
the	14
cage	14
in	14
which	14
Don	14
Quixote	14
was	14
placed,	14
and	14
said,	14
“Señor,	14
to	14
ease	14
my	14
conscience	14
I	14
want	14
to	14
tell	14
you	14
the	14
state	14
of	14
the	14
case	14
as	14
to	14
your	14
enchantment,	14
and	14
that	14
is	14
that	14
these	14
two	14
here,	14
with	14
their	14
faces	14
covered,	14
are	14
the	14
curate	14
of	14
our	14
village	14
and	14
the	14
barber;	14
and	14
I	14
suspect	14
they	14
have	14
hit	14
upon	14
this	14
plan	14
of	14
carrying	14
you	14
off	14
in	14
this	14
fashion,	14
out	14
of	14
pure	14
envy	14
because	14
your	14
worship	14
surpasses	14
them	14
in	14
doing	14
famous	14
deeds;	14
and	14
if	14
this	14
be	14
the	14
truth	14
it	14
follows	14
that	14
you	14
are	14
not	14
enchanted,	14
but	14
hoodwinked	14
and	14
made	14
a	14
fool	14
of.	14
And	14
to	14
prove	14
this	14
I	14
want	14
to	14
ask	14
you	14
one	14
thing;	14
and	14
if	14
you	14
answer	14
me	14
as	14
I	14
believe	14
you	14
will	14
answer,	14
you	14
will	14
be	14
able	14
to	14
lay	14
your	14
finger	14
on	14
the	14
trick,	14
and	14
you	14
will	14
see	14
that	14
you	14
are	14
not	14
enchanted	14
but	14
gone	14
wrong	14
in	14
your	14
wits.”	14
“Ask	14
what	14
thou	14
wilt,	14
Sancho	14
my	14
son,”	14
returned	14
Don	14
Quixote,	14
“for	14
I	14
will	14
satisfy	14
thee	14
and	14
answer	14
all	14
thou	14
requirest.	14
As	14
to	14
what	14
thou	14
sayest,	14
that	14
these	14
who	14
accompany	14
us	14
yonder	14
are	14
the	14
curate	14
and	14
the	14
barber,	14
our	14
neighbours	14
and	14
acquaintances,	14
it	14
is	14
very	14
possible	14
that	14
they	14
may	14
seem	14
to	14
be	14
those	14
same	14
persons;	14
but	14
that	14
they	14
are	14
so	14
in	14
reality	14
and	14
in	14
fact,	14
believe	14
it	14
not	14
on	14
any	14
account;	14
what	14
thou	14
art	14
to	14
believe	14
and	14
think	14
is	14
that,	14
if	14
they	14
look	14
like	14
them,	14
as	14
thou	14
sayest,	14
it	14
must	14
be	14
that	14
those	14
who	14
have	14
enchanted	14
me	14
have	14
taken	14
this	14
shape	14
and	14
likeness;	14
for	14
it	14
is	14
easy	14
for	14
enchanters	14
to	14
take	14
any	14
form	14
they	14
please,	14
and	14
they	14
may	14
have	14
taken	14
those	14
of	14
our	14
friends	14
in	14
order	14
to	14
make	14
thee	14
think	14
as	14
thou	14
dost,	14
and	14
lead	14
thee	14
into	14
a	14
labyrinth	14
of	14
fancies	14
from	14
which	14
thou	14
wilt	14
find	14
no	14
escape	14
though	14
thou	14
hadst	14
the	14
cord	14
of	14
Theseus;	14
and	14
they	14
may	14
also	14
have	14
done	14
it	14
to	14
make	14
me	14
uncertain	14
in	14
my	14
mind,	14
and	14
unable	14
to	14
conjecture	14
whence	14
this	14
evil	14
comes	14
to	14
me;	14
for	14
if	14
on	14
the	14
one	14
hand	14
thou	14
dost	14
tell	14
me	14
that	14
the	14
barber	14
and	14
curate	14
of	14
our	14
village	14
are	14
here	14
in	14
company	14
with	14
us,	14
and	14
on	14
the	14
other	14
I	14
find	14
myself	14
shut	14
up	14
in	14
a	14
cage,	14
and	14
know	14
in	14
my	14
heart	14
that	14
no	14
power	14
on	14
earth	14
that	14
was	14
not	14
supernatural	14
would	14
have	14
been	14
able	14
to	14
shut	14
me	14
in,	14
what	14
wouldst	14
thou	14
have	14
me	14
say	14
or	14
think,	14
but	14
that	14
my	14
enchantment	14
is	14
of	14
a	14
sort	14
that	14
transcends	14
all	14
I	14
have	14
ever	14
read	14
of	14
in	14
all	14
the	14
histories	14
that	14
deal	14
with	14
knights-errant	14
that	14
have	14
been	14
enchanted?	14
So	14
thou	14
mayest	14
set	14
thy	14
mind	14
at	14
rest	14
as	14
to	14
the	14
idea	14
that	14
they	14
are	14
what	14
thou	14
sayest,	14
for	14
they	14
are	14
as	14
much	14
so	14
as	14
I	14
am	14
a	14
Turk.	14
But	14
touching	14
thy	14
desire	14
to	14
ask	14
me	14
something,	14
say	14
on,	14
and	14
I	14
will	14
answer	14
thee,	14
though	14
thou	14
shouldst	14
ask	14
questions	14
from	14
this	14
till	14
to-morrow	14
morning.”	14
“May	14
Our	14
Lady	14
be	14
good	14
to	14
me!”	14
said	14
Sancho,	14
lifting	14
up	14
his	14
voice;	14
“and	14
is	14
it	14
possible	14
that	14
your	14
worship	14
is	14
so	14
thick	14
of	14
skull	14
and	14
so	14
short	14
of	14
brains	14
that	14
you	14
cannot	14
see	14
that	14
what	14
I	14
say	14
is	14
the	14
simple	14
truth,	14
and	14
that	14
malice	14
has	14
more	14
to	14
do	14
with	14
your	14
imprisonment	14
and	14
misfortune	14
than	14
enchantment?	14
But	14
as	14
it	14
is	14
so,	14
I	14
will	14
prove	14
plainly	14
to	14
you	14
that	14
you	14
are	14
not	14
enchanted.	14
Now	14
tell	14
me,	14
so	14
may	14
God	14
deliver	14
you	14
from	14
this	14
affliction,	14
and	14
so	14
may	14
you	14
find	14
yourself	14
when	14
you	14
least	14
expect	14
it	14
in	14
the	14
arms	14
of	14
my	14
lady	14
Dulcinea—”	14
“Leave	14
off	14
conjuring	14
me,”	14
said	14
Don	14
Quixote,	14
“and	14
ask	14
what	14
thou	14
wouldst	14
know;	14
I	14
have	14
already	14
told	14
thee	14
I	14
will	14
answer	14
with	14
all	14
possible	14
precision.”	14
“That	14
is	14
what	14
I	14
want,”	14
said	14
Sancho;	14
“and	14
what	14
I	14
would	14
know,	14
and	14
have	14
you	14
tell	14
me,	14
without	14
adding	14
or	14
leaving	14
out	14
anything,	14
but	14
telling	14
the	14
whole	14
truth	14
as	14
one	14
expects	14
it	14
to	14
be	14
told,	14
and	14
as	14
it	14
is	14
told,	14
by	14
all	14
who	14
profess	14
arms,	14
as	14
your	14
worship	14
professes	14
them,	14
under	14
the	14
title	14
of	14
knights-errant—”	14
“I	14
tell	14
thee	14
I	14
will	14
not	14
lie	14
in	14
any	14
particular,”	14
said	14
Don	14
Quixote;	14
“finish	14
thy	14
question;	14
for	14
in	14
truth	14
thou	14
weariest	14
me	14
with	14
all	14
these	14
asseverations,	14
requirements,	14
and	14
precautions,	14
Sancho.”	14
“Well,	14
I	14
rely	14
on	14
the	14
goodness	14
and	14
truth	14
of	14
my	14
master,”	14
said	14
Sancho;	14
“and	14
so,	14
because	14
it	14
bears	14
upon	14
what	14
we	14
are	14
talking	14
about,	14
I	14
would	14
ask,	14
speaking	14
with	14
all	14
reverence,	14
whether	14
since	14
your	14
worship	14
has	14
been	14
shut	14
up	14
and,	14
as	14
you	14
think,	14
enchanted	14
in	14
this	14
cage,	14
you	14
have	14
felt	14
any	14
desire	14
or	14
inclination	14
to	14
go	14
anywhere,	14
as	14
the	14
saying	14
is?”	14
“I	14
do	14
not	14
understand	14
‘going	14
anywhere,’”	14
said	14
Don	14
Quixote;	14
“explain	14
thyself	14
more	14
clearly,	14
Sancho,	14
if	14
thou	14
wouldst	14
have	14
me	14
give	14
an	14
answer	14
to	14
the	14
point.”	14
“Is	14
it	14
possible,”	14
said	14
Sancho,	14
“that	14
your	14
worship	14
does	14
not	14
understand	14
‘going	14
anywhere’?	14
Why,	14
the	14
schoolboys	14
know	14
that	14
from	14
the	14
time	14
they	14
were	14
babes.	14
Well	14
then,	14
you	14
must	14
know	14
I	14
mean	14
have	14
you	14
had	14
any	14
desire	14
to	14
do	14
what	14
cannot	14
be	14
avoided?”	14
“Ah!	14
now	14
I	14
understand	14
thee,	14
Sancho,”	14
said	14
Don	14
Quixote;	14
“yes,	14
often,	14
and	14
even	14
this	14
minute;	14
get	14
me	14
out	14
of	14
this	14
strait,	14
or	14
all	14
will	14
not	14
go	14
right.”	14

“Aha,	14
I	14
have	14
caught	14
you,”	14
said	14
Sancho;	14
“this	14
is	14
what	14
in	14
my	14
heart	14
and	14
soul	14
I	14
was	14
longing	14
to	14
know.	14
Come	14
now,	14
señor,	14
can	14
you	14
deny	14
what	14
is	14
commonly	14
said	14
around	14
us,	14
when	14
a	14
person	14
is	14
out	14
of	14
humour,	14
‘I	14
don’t	14
know	14
what	14
ails	14
so-and-so,	14
that	14
he	14
neither	14
eats,	14
nor	14
drinks,	14
nor	14
sleeps,	14
nor	14
gives	14
a	14
proper	14
answer	14
to	14
any	14
question;	14
one	14
would	14
think	14
he	14
was	14
enchanted’?	14
From	14
which	14
it	14
is	14
to	14
be	14
gathered	14
that	14
those	14
who	14
do	14
not	14
eat,	14
or	14
drink,	14
or	14
sleep,	14
or	14
do	14
any	14
of	14
the	14
natural	14
acts	14
I	14
am	14
speaking	14
of—that	14
such	14
persons	14
are	14
enchanted;	14
but	14
not	14
those	14
that	14
have	14
the	14
desire	14
your	14
worship	14
has,	14
and	14
drink	14
when	14
drink	14
is	14
given	14
them,	14
and	14
eat	14
when	14
there	14
is	14
anything	14
to	14
eat,	14
and	14
answer	14
every	14
question	14
that	14
is	14
asked	14
them.”	14
“What	14
thou	14
sayest	14
is	14
true,	14
Sancho,”	14
replied	14
Don	14
Quixote;	14
“but	14
I	14
have	14
already	14
told	14
thee	14
there	14
are	14
many	14
sorts	14
of	14
enchantments,	14
and	14
it	14
may	14
be	14
that	14
in	14
the	14
course	14
of	14
time	14
they	14
have	14
been	14
changed	14
one	14
for	14
another,	14
and	14
that	14
now	14
it	14
may	14
be	14
the	14
way	14
with	14
enchanted	14
people	14
to	14
do	14
all	14
that	14
I	14
do,	14
though	14
they	14
did	14
not	14
do	14
so	14
before;	14
so	14
it	14
is	14
vain	14
to	14
argue	14
or	14
draw	14
inferences	14
against	14
the	14
usage	14
of	14
the	14
time.	14
I	14
know	14
and	14
feel	14
that	14
I	14
am	14
enchanted,	14
and	14
that	14
is	14
enough	14
to	14
ease	14
my	14
conscience;	14
for	14
it	14
would	14
weigh	14
heavily	14
on	14
it	14
if	14
I	14
thought	14
that	14
I	14
was	14
not	14
enchanted,	14
and	14
that	14
in	14
a	14
faint-hearted	14
and	14
cowardly	14
way	14
I	14
allowed	14
myself	14
to	14
lie	14
in	14
this	14
cage,	14
defrauding	14
multitudes	14
of	14
the	14
succour	14
I	14
might	14
afford	14
to	14
those	14
in	14
need	14
and	14
distress,	14
who	14
at	14
this	14
very	14
moment	14
may	14
be	14
in	14
sore	14
want	14
of	14
my	14
aid	14
and	14
protection.”	14
“Still	14
for	14
all	14
that,”	14
replied	14
Sancho,	14
“I	14
say	14
that,	14
for	14
your	14
greater	14
and	14
fuller	14
satisfaction,	14
it	14
would	14
be	14
well	14
if	14
your	14
worship	14
were	14
to	14
try	14
to	14
get	14
out	14
of	14
this	14
prison	14
(and	14
I	14
promise	14
to	14
do	14
all	14
in	14
my	14
power	14
to	14
help,	14
and	14
even	14
to	14
take	14
you	14
out	14
of	14
it),	14
and	14
see	14
if	14
you	14
could	14
once	14
more	14
mount	14
your	14
good	14
Rocinante,	14
who	14
seems	14
to	14
be	14
enchanted	14
too,	14
he	14
is	14
so	14
melancholy	14
and	14
dejected;	14
and	14
then	14
we	14
might	14
try	14
our	14
chance	14
in	14
looking	14
for	14
adventures	14
again;	14
and	14
if	14
we	14
have	14
no	14
luck	14
there	14
will	14
be	14
time	14
enough	14
to	14
go	14
back	14
to	14
the	14
cage;	14
in	14
which,	14
on	14
the	14
faith	14
of	14
a	14
good	14
and	14
loyal	14
squire,	14
I	14
promise	14
to	14
shut	14
myself	14
up	14
along	14
with	14
your	14
worship,	14
if	14
so	14
be	14
you	14
are	14
so	14
unfortunate,	14
or	14
I	14
so	14
stupid,	14
as	14
not	14
to	14
be	14
able	14
to	14
carry	14
out	14
my	14
plan.”	14
“I	14
am	14
content	14
to	14
do	14
as	14
thou	14
sayest,	14
brother	14
Sancho,”	14
said	14
Don	14
Quixote,	14
“and	14
when	14
thou	14
seest	14
an	14
opportunity	14
for	14
effecting	14
my	14
release	14
I	14
will	14
obey	14
thee	14
absolutely;	14
but	14
thou	14
wilt	14
see,	14
Sancho,	14
how	14
mistaken	14
thou	14
art	14
in	14
thy	14
conception	14
of	14
my	14
misfortune.”	14
The	14
knight-errant	14
and	14
the	14
ill-errant	14
squire	14
kept	14
up	14
their	14
conversation	14
till	14
they	14
reached	14
the	14
place	14
where	14
the	14
curate,	14
the	14
canon,	14
and	14
the	14
barber,	14
who	14
had	14
already	14
dismounted,	14
were	14
waiting	14
for	14
them.	14
The	14
carter	14
at	14
once	14
unyoked	14
the	14
oxen	14
and	14
left	14
them	14
to	14
roam	14
at	14
large	14
about	14
the	14
pleasant	14
green	14
spot,	14
the	14
freshness	14
of	14
which	14
seemed	14
to	14
invite,	14
not	14
enchanted	14
people	14
like	14
Don	14
Quixote,	14
but	14
wide-awake,	14
sensible	14
folk	14
like	14
his	14
squire,	14
who	14
begged	14
the	14
curate	14
to	14
allow	14
his	14
master	14
to	14
leave	14
the	14
cage	14
for	14
a	14
little;	14
for	14
if	14
they	14
did	14
not	14
let	14
him	14
out,	14
the	14
prison	14
might	14
not	14
be	14
as	14
clean	14
as	14
the	14
propriety	14
of	14
such	14
a	14
gentleman	14
as	14
his	14
master	14
required.	14
The	14
curate	14
understood	14
him,	14
and	14
said	14
he	14
would	14
very	14
gladly	14
comply	14
with	14
his	14
request,	14
only	14
that	14
he	14
feared	14
his	14
master,	14
finding	14
himself	14
at	14
liberty,	14
would	14
take	14
to	14
his	14
old	14
courses	14
and	14
make	14
off	14
where	14
nobody	14
could	14
ever	14
find	14
him	14
again.	14
“I	14
will	14
answer	14
for	14
his	14
not	14
running	14
away,”	14
said	14
Sancho.	14
“And	14
I	14
also,”	14
said	14
the	14
canon,	14
“especially	14
if	14
he	14
gives	14
me	14
his	14
word	14
as	14
a	14
knight	14
not	14
to	14
leave	14
us	14
without	14
our	14
consent.”	14
Don	14
Quixote,	14
who	14
was	14
listening	14
to	14
all	14
this,	14
said,	14
“I	14
give	14
it;—moreover	14
one	14
who	14
is	14
enchanted	14
as	14
I	14
am	14
cannot	14
do	14
as	14
he	14
likes	14
with	14
himself;	14
for	14
he	14
who	14
had	14
enchanted	14
him	14
could	14
prevent	14
his	14
moving	14
from	14
one	14
place	14
for	14
three	14
ages,	14
and	14
if	14
he	14
attempted	14
to	14
escape	14
would	14
bring	14
him	14
back	14
flying.”—And	14
that	14
being	14
so,	14
they	14
might	14
as	14
well	14
release	14
him,	14
particularly	14
as	14
it	14
would	14
be	14
to	14
the	14
advantage	14
of	14
all;	14
for,	14
if	14
they	14
did	14
not	14
let	14
him	14
out,	14
he	14
protested	14
he	14
would	14
be	14
unable	14
to	14
avoid	14
offending	14
their	14
nostrils	14
unless	14
they	14
kept	14
their	14
distance.	14
The	14
canon	14
took	14
his	14
hand,	14
tied	14
together	14
as	14
they	14
both	14
were,	14
and	14
on	14
his	14
word	14
and	14
promise	14
they	14
unbound	14
him,	14
and	14
rejoiced	14
beyond	14
measure	14
he	14
was	14
to	14
find	14
himself	14
out	14
of	14
the	14
cage.	14
The	14
first	14
thing	14
he	14
did	14
was	14
to	14
stretch	14
himself	14
all	14
over,	14
and	14
then	14
he	14
went	14
to	14
where	14
Rocinante	14
was	14
standing	14
and	14
giving	14
him	14
a	14
couple	14
of	14
slaps	14
on	14
the	14
haunches	14
said,	14
“I	14
still	14
trust	14
in	14
God	14
and	14
in	14
his	14
blessed	14
mother,	14
O	14
flower	14
and	14
mirror	14
of	14
steeds,	14
that	14
we	14
shall	14
soon	14
see	14
ourselves,	14
both	14
of	14
us,	14
as	14
we	14
wish	14
to	14
be,	14
thou	14
with	14
thy	14
master	14
on	14
thy	14
back,	14
and	14
I	14
mounted	14
upon	14
thee,	14
following	14
the	14
calling	14
for	14
which	14
God	14
sent	14
me	14
into	14
the	14
world.”	14
And	14
so	14
saying,	14
accompanied	14
by	14
Sancho,	14
he	14
withdrew	14
to	14
a	14
retired	14
spot,	14
from	14
which	14
he	14
came	14
back	14
much	14
relieved	14
and	14
more	14
eager	14
than	14
ever	14
to	14
put	14
his	14
squire’s	14
scheme	14
into	14
execution.	14
The	14
canon	14
gazed	14
at	14
him,	14
wondering	14
at	14
the	14
extraordinary	14
nature	14
of	14
his	14
madness,	14
and	14
that	14
in	14
all	14
his	14
remarks	14
and	14
replies	14
he	14
should	14
show	14
such	14
excellent	14
sense,	14
and	14
only	14
lose	14
his	14
stirrups,	14
as	14
has	14
been	14
already	14
said,	14
when	14
the	14
subject	14
of	14
chivalry	14
was	14
broached.	14
And	14
so,	14
moved	14
by	14
compassion,	14
he	14
said	14
to	14
him,	14
as	14
they	14
all	14
sat	14
on	14
the	14
green	14
grass	14
awaiting	14
the	14
arrival	14
of	14
the	14
provisions:	14
“Is	14
it	14
possible,	14
gentle	14
sir,	14
that	14
the	14
nauseous	14
and	14
idle	14
reading	14
of	14
books	14
of	14
chivalry	14
can	14
have	14
had	14
such	14
an	14
effect	14
on	14
your	14
worship	14
as	14
to	14
upset	14
your	14
reason	14
so	14
that	14
you	14
fancy	14
yourself	14
enchanted,	14
and	14
the	14
like,	14
all	14
as	14
far	14
from	14
the	14
truth	14
as	14
falsehood	14
itself	14
is?	14
How	14
can	14
there	14
be	14
any	14
human	14
understanding	14
that	14
can	14
persuade	14
itself	14
there	14
ever	14
was	14
all	14
that	14
infinity	14
of	14
Amadises	14
in	14
the	14
world,	14
or	14
all	14
that	14
multitude	14
of	14
famous	14
knights,	14
all	14
those	14
emperors	14
of	14
Trebizond,	14
all	14
those	14
Felixmartes	14
of	14
Hircania,	14
all	14
those	14
palfreys,	14
and	14
damsels-errant,	14
and	14
serpents,	14
and	14
monsters,	14
and	14
giants,	14
and	14
marvellous	14
adventures,	14
and	14
enchantments	14
of	14
every	14
kind,	14
and	14
battles,	14
and	14
prodigious	14
encounters,	14
splendid	14
costumes,	14
love-sick	14
princesses,	14
squires	14
made	14
counts,	14
droll	14
dwarfs,	14
love	14
letters,	14
billings	14
and	14
cooings,	14
swashbuckler	14
women,	14
and,	14
in	14
a	14
word,	14
all	14
that	14
nonsense	14
the	14
books	14
of	14
chivalry	14
contain?	14
For	14
myself,	14
I	14
can	14
only	14
say	14
that	14
when	14
I	14
read	14
them,	14
so	14
long	14
as	14
I	14
do	14
not	14
stop	14
to	14
think	14
that	14
they	14
are	14
all	14
lies	14
and	14
frivolity,	14
they	14
give	14
me	14
a	14
certain	14
amount	14
of	14
pleasure;	14
but	14
when	14
I	14
come	14
to	14
consider	14
what	14
they	14
are,	14
I	14
fling	14
the	14
very	14
best	14
of	14
them	14
at	14
the	14
wall,	14
and	14
would	14
fling	14
it	14
into	14
the	14
fire	14
if	14
there	14
were	14
one	14
at	14
hand,	14
as	14
richly	14
deserving	14
such	14
punishment	14
as	14
cheats	14
and	14
impostors	14
out	14
of	14
the	14
range	14
of	14
ordinary	14
toleration,	14
and	14
as	14
founders	14
of	14
new	14
sects	14
and	14
modes	14
of	14
life,	14
and	14
teachers	14
that	14
lead	14
the	14
ignorant	14
public	14
to	14
believe	14
and	14
accept	14
as	14
truth	14
all	14
the	14
folly	14
they	14
contain.	14
And	14
such	14
is	14
their	14
audacity,	14
they	14
even	14
dare	14
to	14
unsettle	14
the	14
wits	14
of	14
gentlemen	14
of	14
birth	14
and	14
intelligence,	14
as	14
is	14
shown	14
plainly	14
by	14
the	14
way	14
they	14
have	14
served	14
your	14
worship,	14
when	14
they	14
have	14
brought	14
you	14
to	14
such	14
a	14
pass	14
that	14
you	14
have	14
to	14
be	14
shut	14
up	14
in	14
a	14
cage	14
and	14
carried	14
on	14
an	14
ox-cart	14
as	14
one	14
would	14
carry	14
a	14
lion	14
or	14
a	14
tiger	14
from	14
place	14
to	14
place	14
to	14
make	14
money	14
by	14
showing	14
it.	14
Come,	14
Señor	14
Don	14
Quixote,	14
have	14
some	14
compassion	14
for	14
yourself,	14
return	14
to	14
the	14
bosom	14
of	14
common	14
sense,	14
and	14
make	14
use	14
of	14
the	14
liberal	14
share	14
of	14
it	14
that	14
heaven	14
has	14
been	14
pleased	14
to	14
bestow	14
upon	14
you,	14
employing	14
your	14
abundant	14
gifts	14
of	14
mind	14
in	14
some	14
other	14
reading	14
that	14
may	14
serve	14
to	14
benefit	14
your	14
conscience	14
and	14
add	14
to	14
your	14
honour.	14
And	14
if,	14
still	14
led	14
away	14
by	14
your	14
natural	14
bent,	14
you	14
desire	14
to	14
read	14
books	14
of	14
achievements	14
and	14
of	14
chivalry,	14
read	14
the	14
Book	14
of	14
Judges	14
in	14
the	14
Holy	14
Scriptures,	14
for	14
there	14
you	14
will	14
find	14
grand	14
reality,	14
and	14
deeds	14
as	14
true	14
as	14
they	14
are	14
heroic.	14
Lusitania	14
had	14
a	14
Viriatus,	14
Rome	14
a	14
Cæsar,	14
Carthage	14
a	14
Hannibal,	14
Greece	14
an	14
Alexander,	14
Castile	14
a	14
Count	14
Fernan	14
Gonzalez,	14
Valencia	14
a	14
Cid,	14
Andalusia	14
a	14
Gonzalo	14
Fernandez,	14
Estremadura	14
a	14
Diego	14
García	14
de	14
Paredes,	14
Jerez	14
a	14
Garci	14
Perez	14
de	14
Vargas,	14
Toledo	14
a	14
Garcilaso,	14
Seville	14
a	14
Don	14
Manuel	14
de	14
Leon,	14
to	14
read	14
of	14
whose	14
valiant	14
deeds	14
will	14
entertain	14
and	14
instruct	14
the	14
loftiest	14
minds	14
and	14
fill	14
them	14
with	14
delight	14
and	14
wonder.	14
Here,	14
Señor	14
Don	14
Quixote,	14
will	14
be	14
reading	14
worthy	14
of	14
your	14
sound	14
understanding;	14
from	14
which	14
you	14
will	14
rise	14
learned	14
in	14
history,	14
in	14
love	14
with	14
virtue,	14
strengthened	14
in	14
goodness,	14
improved	14
in	14
manners,	14
brave	14
without	14
rashness,	14
prudent	14
without	14
cowardice;	14
and	14
all	14
to	14
the	14
honour	14
of	14
God,	14
your	14
own	14
advantage	14
and	14
the	14
glory	14
of	14
La	14
Mancha,	14
whence,	14
I	14
am	14
informed,	14
your	14
worship	14
derives	14
your	14
birth.”	14
Don	14
Quixote	14
listened	14
with	14
the	14
greatest	14
attention	14
to	14
the	14
canon’s	14
words,	14
and	14
when	14
he	14
found	14
he	14
had	14
finished,	14
after	14
regarding	14
him	14
for	14
some	14
time,	14
he	14
replied	14
to	14
him:	14
“It	14
appears	14
to	14
me,	14
gentle	14
sir,	14
that	14
your	14
worship’s	14
discourse	14
is	14
intended	14
to	14
persuade	14
me	14
that	14
there	14
never	14
were	14
any	14
knights-errant	14
in	14
the	14
world,	14
and	14
that	14
all	14
the	14
books	14
of	14
chivalry	14
are	14
false,	14
lying,	14
mischievous	14
and	14
useless	14
to	14
the	14
State,	14
and	14
that	14
I	14
have	14
done	14
wrong	14
in	14
reading	14
them,	14
and	14
worse	14
in	14
believing	14
them,	14
and	14
still	14
worse	14
in	14
imitating	14
them,	14
when	14
I	14
undertook	14
to	14
follow	14
the	14
arduous	14
calling	14
of	14
knight-errantry	14
which	14
they	14
set	14
forth;	14
for	14
you	14
deny	14
that	14
there	14
ever	14
were	14
Amadises	14
of	14
Gaul	14
or	14
of	14
Greece,	14
or	14
any	14
other	14
of	14
the	14
knights	14
of	14
whom	14
the	14
books	14
are	14
full.”	14
“It	14
is	14
all	14
exactly	14
as	14
you	14
state	14
it,”	14
said	14
the	14
canon;	14
to	14
which	14
Don	14
Quixote	14
returned,	14
“You	14
also	14
went	14
on	14
to	14
say	14
that	14
books	14
of	14
this	14
kind	14
had	14
done	14
me	14
much	14
harm,	14
inasmuch	14
as	14
they	14
had	14
upset	14
my	14
senses,	14
and	14
shut	14
me	14
up	14
in	14
a	14
cage,	14
and	14
that	14
it	14
would	14
be	14
better	14
for	14
me	14
to	14
reform	14
and	14
change	14
my	14
studies,	14
and	14
read	14
other	14
truer	14
books	14
which	14
would	14
afford	14
more	14
pleasure	14
and	14
instruction.”	14
“Just	14
so,”	14
said	14
the	14
canon.	14
“Well	14
then,”	14
returned	14
Don	14
Quixote,	14
“to	14
my	14
mind	14
it	14
is	14
you	14
who	14
are	14
the	14
one	14
that	14
is	14
out	14
of	14
his	14
wits	14
and	14
enchanted,	14
as	14
you	14
have	14
ventured	14
to	14
utter	14
such	14
blasphemies	14
against	14
a	14
thing	14
so	14
universally	14
acknowledged	14
and	14
accepted	14
as	14
true	14
that	14
whoever	14
denies	14
it,	14
as	14
you	14
do,	14
deserves	14
the	14
same	14
punishment	14
which	14
you	14
say	14
you	14
inflict	14
on	14
the	14
books	14
that	14
irritate	14
you	14
when	14
you	14
read	14
them.	14
For	14
to	14
try	14
to	14
persuade	14
anybody	14
that	14
Amadis,	14
and	14
all	14
the	14
other	14
knights-adventurers	14
with	14
whom	14
the	14
books	14
are	14
filled,	14
never	14
existed,	14
would	14
be	14
like	14
trying	14
to	14
persuade	14
him	14
that	14
the	14
sun	14
does	14
not	14
yield	14
light,	14
or	14
ice	14
cold,	14
or	14
earth	14
nourishment.	14
What	14
wit	14
in	14
the	14
world	14
can	14
persuade	14
another	14
that	14
the	14
story	14
of	14
the	14
Princess	14
Floripes	14
and	14
Guy	14
of	14
Burgundy	14
is	14
not	14
true,	14
or	14
that	14
of	14
Fierabras	14
and	14
the	14
bridge	14
of	14
Mantible,	14
which	14
happened	14
in	14
the	14
time	14
of	14
Charlemagne?	14
For	14
by	14
all	14
that	14
is	14
good	14
it	14
is	14
as	14
true	14
as	14
that	14
it	14
is	14
daylight	14
now;	14
and	14
if	14
it	14
be	14
a	14
lie,	14
it	14
must	14
be	14
a	14
lie	14
too	14
that	14
there	14
was	14
a	14
Hector,	14
or	14
Achilles,	14
or	14
Trojan	14
war,	14
or	14
Twelve	14
Peers	14
of	14
France,	14
or	14
Arthur	14
of	14
England,	14
who	14
still	14
lives	14
changed	14
into	14
a	14
raven,	14
and	14
is	14
unceasingly	14
looked	14
for	14
in	14
his	14
kingdom.	14
One	14
might	14
just	14
as	14
well	14
try	14
to	14
make	14
out	14
that	14
the	14
history	14
of	14
Guarino	14
Mezquino,	14
or	14
of	14
the	14
quest	14
of	14
the	14
Holy	14
Grail,	14
is	14
false,	14
or	14
that	14
the	14
loves	14
of	14
Tristram	14
and	14
the	14
Queen	14
Yseult	14
are	14
apocryphal,	14
as	14
well	14
as	14
those	14
of	14
Guinevere	14
and	14
Lancelot,	14
when	14
there	14
are	14
persons	14
who	14
can	14
almost	14
remember	14
having	14
seen	14
the	14
Dame	14
Quintañona,	14
who	14
was	14
the	14
best	14
cupbearer	14
in	14
Great	14
Britain.	14
And	14
so	14
true	14
is	14
this,	14
that	14
I	14
recollect	14
a	14
grandmother	14
of	14
mine	14
on	14
the	14
father’s	14
side,	14
whenever	14
she	14
saw	14
any	14
dame	14
in	14
a	14
venerable	14
hood,	14
used	14
to	14
say	14
to	14
me,	14
‘Grandson,	14
that	14
one	14
is	14
like	14
Dame	14
Quintañona,’	14
from	14
which	14
I	14
conclude	14
that	14
she	14
must	14
have	14
known	14
her,	14
or	14
at	14
least	14
had	14
managed	14
to	14
see	14
some	14
portrait	14
of	14
her.	14
Then	14
who	14
can	14
deny	14
that	14
the	14
story	14
of	14
Pierres	14
and	14
the	14
fair	14
Magalona	14
is	14
true,	14
when	14
even	14
to	14
this	14
day	14
may	14
be	14
seen	14
in	14
the	14
king’s	14
armoury	14
the	14
pin	14
with	14
which	14
the	14
valiant	14
Pierres	14
guided	14
the	14
wooden	14
horse	14
he	14
rode	14
through	14
the	14
air,	14
and	14
it	14
is	14
a	14
trifle	14
bigger	14
than	14
the	14
pole	14
of	14
a	14
cart?	14
And	14
alongside	14
of	14
the	14
pin	14
is	14
Babieca’s	14
saddle,	14
and	14
at	14
Roncesvalles	14
there	14
is	14
Roland’s	14
horn,	14
as	14
large	14
as	14
a	14
large	14
beam;	14
whence	14
we	14
may	14
infer	14
that	14
there	14
were	14
Twelve	14
Peers,	14
and	14
a	14
Pierres,	14
and	14
a	14
Cid,	14
and	14
other	14
knights	14
like	14
them,	14
of	14
the	14
sort	14
people	14
commonly	14
call	14
adventurers.	14
Or	14
perhaps	14
I	14
shall	14
be	14
told,	14
too,	14
that	14
there	14
was	14
no	14
such	14
knight-errant	14
as	14
the	14
valiant	14
Lusitanian	14
Juan	14
de	14
Merlo,	14
who	14
went	14
to	14
Burgundy	14
and	14
in	14
the	14
city	14
of	14
Arras	14
fought	14
with	14
the	14
famous	14
lord	14
of	14
Charny,	14
Mosen	14
Pierres	14
by	14
name,	14
and	14
afterwards	14
in	14
the	14
city	14
of	14
Basle	14
with	14
Mosen	14
Enrique	14
de	14
Remesten,	14
coming	14
out	14
of	14
both	14
encounters	14
covered	14
with	14
fame	14
and	14
honour;	14
or	14
adventures	14
and	14
challenges	14
achieved	14
and	14
delivered,	14
also	14
in	14
Burgundy,	14
by	14
the	14
valiant	14
Spaniards	14
Pedro	14
Barba	14
and	14
Gutierre	14
Quixada	14
(of	14
whose	14
family	14
I	14
come	14
in	14
the	14
direct	14
male	14
line),	14
when	14
they	14
vanquished	14
the	14
sons	14
of	14
the	14
Count	14
of	14
San	14
Polo.	14
I	14
shall	14
be	14
told,	14
too,	14
that	14
Don	14
Fernando	14
de	14
Guevara	14
did	14
not	14
go	14
in	14
quest	14
of	14
adventures	14
to	14
Germany,	14
where	14
he	14
engaged	14
in	14
combat	14
with	14
Micer	14
George,	14
a	14
knight	14
of	14
the	14
house	14
of	14
the	14
Duke	14
of	14
Austria.	14
I	14
shall	14
be	14
told	14
that	14
the	14
jousts	14
of	14
Suero	14
de	14
Quiñones,	14
him	14
of	14
the	14
‘Paso,’	14
and	14
the	14
emprise	14
of	14
Mosen	14
Luis	14
de	14
Falces	14
against	14
the	14
Castilian	14
knight,	14
Don	14
Gonzalo	14
de	14
Guzman,	14
were	14
mere	14
mockeries;	14
as	14
well	14
as	14
many	14
other	14
achievements	14
of	14
Christian	14
knights	14
of	14
these	14
and	14
foreign	14
realms,	14
which	14
are	14
so	14
authentic	14
and	14
true,	14
that,	14
I	14
repeat,	14
he	14
who	14
denies	14
them	14
must	14
be	14
totally	14
wanting	14
in	14
reason	14
and	14
good	14
sense.”	14
The	14
canon	14
was	14
amazed	14
to	14
hear	14
the	14
medley	14
of	14
truth	14
and	14
fiction	14
Don	14
Quixote	14
uttered,	14
and	14
to	14
see	14
how	14
well	14
acquainted	14
he	14
was	14
with	14
everything	14
relating	14
or	14
belonging	14
to	14
the	14
achievements	14
of	14
his	14
knight-errantry;	14
so	14
he	14
said	14
in	14
reply:	14
“I	14
cannot	14
deny,	14
Señor	14
Don	14
Quixote,	14
that	14
there	14
is	14
some	14
truth	14
in	14
what	14
you	14
say,	14
especially	14
as	14
regards	14
the	14
Spanish	14
knights-errant;	14
and	14
I	14
am	14
willing	14
to	14
grant	14
too	14
that	14
the	14
Twelve	14
Peers	14
of	14
France	14
existed,	14
but	14
I	14
am	14
not	14
disposed	14
to	14
believe	14
that	14
they	14
did	14
all	14
the	14
things	14
that	14
the	14
Archbishop	14
Turpin	14
relates	14
of	14
them.	14
For	14
the	14
truth	14
of	14
the	14
matter	14
is	14
they	14
were	14
knights	14
chosen	14
by	14
the	14
kings	14
of	14
France,	14
and	14
called	14
‘Peers’	14
because	14
they	14
were	14
all	14
equal	14
in	14
worth,	14
rank	14
and	14
prowess	14
(at	14
least	14
if	14
they	14
were	14
not	14
they	14
ought	14
to	14
have	14
been),	14
and	14
it	14
was	14
a	14
kind	14
of	14
religious	14
order	14
like	14
those	14
of	14
Santiago	14
and	14
Calatrava	14
in	14
the	14
present	14
day,	14
in	14
which	14
it	14
is	14
assumed	14
that	14
those	14
who	14
take	14
it	14
are	14
valiant	14
knights	14
of	14
distinction	14
and	14
good	14
birth;	14
and	14
just	14
as	14
we	14
say	14
now	14
a	14
Knight	14
of	14
St.	14
John,	14
or	14
of	14
Alcántara,	14
they	14
used	14
to	14
say	14
then	14
a	14
Knight	14
of	14
the	14
Twelve	14
Peers,	14
because	14
twelve	14
equals	14
were	14
chosen	14
for	14
that	14
military	14
order.	14
That	14
there	14
was	14
a	14
Cid,	14
as	14
well	14
as	14
a	14
Bernardo	14
del	14
Carpio,	14
there	14
can	14
be	14
no	14
doubt;	14
but	14
that	14
they	14
did	14
the	14
deeds	14
people	14
say	14
they	14
did,	14
I	14
hold	14
to	14
be	14
very	14
doubtful.	14
In	14
that	14
other	14
matter	14
of	14
the	14
pin	14
of	14
Count	14
Pierres	14
that	14
you	14
speak	14
of,	14
and	14
say	14
is	14
near	14
Babieca’s	14
saddle	14
in	14
the	14
Armoury,	14
I	14
confess	14
my	14
sin;	14
for	14
I	14
am	14
either	14
so	14
stupid	14
or	14
so	14
short-sighted,	14
that,	14
though	14
I	14
have	14
seen	14
the	14
saddle,	14
I	14
have	14
never	14
been	14
able	14
to	14
see	14
the	14
pin,	14
in	14
spite	14
of	14
it	14
being	14
as	14
big	14
as	14
your	14
worship	14
says	14
it	14
is.”	14
“For	14
all	14
that	14
it	14
is	14
there,	14
without	14
any	14
manner	14
of	14
doubt,”	14
said	14
Don	14
Quixote;	14
“and	14
more	14
by	14
token	14
they	14
say	14
it	14
is	14
inclosed	14
in	14
a	14
sheath	14
of	14
cowhide	14
to	14
keep	14
it	14
from	14
rusting.”	14
“All	14
that	14
may	14
be,”	14
replied	14
the	14
canon;	14
“but,	14
by	14
the	14
orders	14
I	14
have	14
received,	14
I	14
do	14
not	14
remember	14
seeing	14
it.	14
However,	14
granting	14
it	14
is	14
there,	14
that	14
is	14
no	14
reason	14
why	14
I	14
am	14
bound	14
to	14
believe	14
the	14
stories	14
of	14
all	14
those	14
Amadises	14
and	14
of	14
all	14
that	14
multitude	14
of	14
knights	14
they	14
tell	14
us	14
about,	14
nor	14
is	14
it	14
reasonable	14
that	14
a	14
man	14
like	14
your	14
worship,	14
so	14
worthy,	14
and	14
with	14
so	14
many	14
good	14
qualities,	14
and	14
endowed	14
with	14
such	14
a	14
good	14
understanding,	14
should	14
allow	14
himself	14
to	14
be	14
persuaded	14
that	14
such	14
wild	14
crazy	14
things	14
as	14
are	14
written	14
in	14
those	14
absurd	14
books	14
of	14
chivalry	14
are	14
really	14
true.”	14

“A	14

returned	14
Don	14
Quixote.	14
“Books	14
that	14
have	14
been	14
printed	14
with	14
the	14
king’s	14
licence,	14
and	14
with	14
the	14
approbation	14
of	14
those	14
to	14
whom	14
they	14
have	14
been	14
submitted,	14
and	14
read	14
with	14
universal	14
delight,	14
and	14
extolled	14
by	14
great	14
and	14
small,	14
rich	14
and	14
poor,	14
learned	14
and	14
ignorant,	14
gentle	14
and	14
simple,	14
in	14

of	14
every	14
sort,	14
of	14
whatever	14
rank	14
or	14

they	14
may	14
be—that	14
these	14
should	14
be	14
lies!	14
And	14
above	14
all	14
when	14
they	14
carry	14
such	14
an	14
appearance	14
of	14
truth	14
with	14
them;	14
for	14
they	14
tell	14
us	14
the	14

place,	14

and	14
day	14
by	14
day,	14
performed	14
by	14
such	14
a	14
knight	14
or	14
knights!	14
Hush,	14
sir;	14
utter	14
not	14
such	14
blasphemy;	14
trust	14
me	14
I	14
am	14
advising	14
you	14
now	14
to	14
act	14
as	14
a	14
sensible	14

should;	14
only	14

and	14
you	14
will	14
see	14

pleasure	14
you	14
will	14
derive	14
from	14
them.	14
For,	14
come,	14
tell	14
me,	14
can	14
there	14
be	14
anything	14
more	14
delightful	14
than	14
to	14
see,	14
as	14
it	14
were,	14
here	14
now	14
displayed	14
before	14
us	14
a	14
vast	14
lake	14
of	14
bubbling	14
pitch	14
with	14
a	14
host	14
of	14
snakes	14

serpents	14

lizards,	14
and	14
ferocious	14
and	14
terrible	14
creatures	14
of	14
all	14

swimming	14
about	14
in	14
it,	14
while	14
from	14
the	14
middle	14
of	14
the	14
lake	14
there	14
comes	14
a	14
plaintive	14
voice	14
saying:	14
‘Knight,	14
whosoever	14
thou	14
art	14
who	14
beholdest	14
this	14
dread	14
lake,	14
if	14
thou	14
wouldst	14
win	14
the	14
prize	14
that	14
lies	14
hidden	14
beneath	14
these	14
dusky	14
waves,	14
prove	14
the	14
valour	14
of	14
thy	14
stout	14
heart	14
and	14
cast	14
thyself	14
into	14
the	14
midst	14
of	14
its	14
dark	14
burning	14
waters,	14
else	14
thou	14
shalt	14
not	14
be	14
worthy	14
to	14
see	14
the	14
mighty	14
wonders	14
contained	14
in	14
the	14
seven	14
castles	14
of	14
the	14
seven	14
Fays	14
that	14
lie	14
beneath	14
this	14
black	14
expanse;’	14
and	14
then	14
the	14
knight,	14
almost	14
ere	14
the	14
awful	14
voice	14
has	14
ceased,	14
without	14
stopping	14
to	14
consider,	14
without	14
pausing	14
to	14
reflect	14
upon	14
the	14
danger	14
to	14
which	14
he	14
is	14
exposing	14
himself,	14
without	14
even	14
relieving	14
himself	14
of	14
the	14
weight	14
of	14
his	14
massive	14
armour,	14
commending	14
himself	14
to	14
God	14
and	14
to	14
his	14
lady,	14
plunges	14
into	14
the	14
midst	14
of	14
the	14
boiling	14
lake,	14
and	14
when	14
he	14
little	14
looks	14
for	14
it,	14
or	14
knows	14
what	14
his	14
fate	14
is	14
to	14
be,	14
he	14
finds	14
himself	14
among	14
flowery	14
meadows,	14
with	14
which	14
the	14
Elysian	14
fields	14

presented	14
to	14
his	14
sight	14
a	14
strong	14
castle	14
or	14
gorgeous	14
palace	14
with	14
walls	14
of	14
massy	14
gold,	14
turrets	14
of	14
diamond	14
and	14
gates	14
of	14
jacinth;	14
in	14
short,	14
so	14
marvellous	14
is	14
its	14
structure	14
that	14
though	14
the	14
materials	14
of	14
which	14
it	14
is	14
built	14
are	14
nothing	14
less	14
than	14
diamonds,	14
carbuncles,	14
rubies,	14
pearls,	14
gold,	14
and	14
emeralds,	14
the	14
workmanship	14
is	14
still	14
more	14
rare.	14
And	14
after	14
having	14
seen	14
all	14
this,	14
what	14
can	14
be	14
more	14
charming	14
than	14
to	14
see	14
how	14
a	14
bevy	14
of	14
damsels	14
comes	14
forth	14
from	14
the	14
gate	14
of	14
the	14
castle	14
in	14
gay	14
and	14
gorgeous	14
attire,	14
such	14
that,	14
were	14
I	14
to	14
set	14
myself	14
now	14
to	14
depict	14
it	14
as	14
the	14
histories	14
describe	14
it	14
to	14
us,	14
I	14
should	14
never	14
have	14
done;	14
and	14
then	14
how	14
she	14
who	14
seems	14
to	14
be	14
the	14
first	14
among	14
them	14
all	14
takes	14
the	14
bold	14
knight	14
who	14
plunged	14
into	14
the	14
boiling	14
lake	14
by	14
the	14
hand,	14
and	14
without	14
addressing	14
a	14
word	14
to	14
him	14
leads	14
him	14
into	14
the	14
rich	14
palace	14
or	14
castle,	14
and	14
strips	14
him	14
as	14
naked	14
as	14
when	14
his	14
mother	14
bore	14
him,	14
and	14
bathes	14
him	14
in	14
lukewarm	14
water,	14
and	14
anoints	14
him	14
all	14
over	14
with	14
sweet-smelling	14
unguents,	14
and	14
clothes	14
him	14
in	14
a	14
shirt	14
of	14
the	14
softest	14
sendal,	14
all	14
scented	14
and	14
perfumed,	14
while	14
another	14
damsel	14
comes	14
and	14
throws	14
over	14
his	14
shoulders	14
a	14
mantle	14
which	14
is	14
said	14
to	14
be	14
worth	14
at	14
the	14
very	14
least	14
a	14
city,	14
and	14
even	14
more?	14
How	14
charming	14
it	14
is,	14
then,	14
when	14
they	14
tell	14
us	14
how,	14
after	14
all	14
this,	14
they	14
lead	14
him	14
to	14
another	14
chamber	14
where	14
he	14
finds	14
the	14
tables	14
set	14
out	14
in	14
such	14
style	14
that	14
he	14
is	14
filled	14
with	14
amazement	14
and	14
wonder;	14
to	14
see	14
how	14
they	14
pour	14
out	14
water	14
for	14
his	14
hands	14
distilled	14
from	14
amber	14
and	14
sweet-scented	14
flowers;	14
how	14
they	14
seat	14
him	14
on	14
an	14
ivory	14
chair;	14
to	14
see	14
how	14
the	14
damsels	14
wait	14
on	14
him	14
all	14
in	14
profound	14
silence;	14
how	14
they	14
bring	14
him	14
such	14
a	14
variety	14
of	14
dainties	14
so	14
temptingly	14
prepared	14
that	14
the	14
appetite	14
is	14
at	14
a	14
loss	14
which	14
to	14
select;	14
to	14
hear	14
the	14
music	14
that	14
resounds	14
while	14
he	14
is	14
at	14
table,	14
by	14
whom	14
or	14
whence	14
produced	14
he	14
knows	14
not.	14
And	14
then	14
when	14
the	14
repast	14
is	14
over	14
and	14
the	14
tables	14
removed,	14
for	14
the	14
knight	14
to	14
recline	14
in	14
the	14
chair,	14
picking	14
his	14
teeth	14
perhaps	14
as	14
usual,	14
and	14
a	14
damsel,	14
much	14
lovelier	14
than	14
any	14
of	14
the	14
others,	14
to	14
enter	14
unexpectedly	14
by	14
the	14
chamber	14
door,	14
and	14
herself	14
by	14
his	14
side,	14
and	14
begin	14
to	14
tell	14
him	14
what	14
the	14
castle	14
is,	14
and	14
how	14
she	14
is	14
held	14
enchanted	14
there,	14
and	14
other	14
things	14
that	14
amaze	14
the	14
knight	14
and	14
astonish	14
the	14
readers	14
who	14
are	14
perusing	14
his	14
history.	14

“But	14
I	14
will	14
not	14
expatiate	14
any	14
further	14
upon	14
this,	14
as	14
it	14
may	14
be	14
gathered	14
from	14
it	14
that	14
whatever	14
part	14
of	14
whatever	14
history	14
of	14
a	14

whoever	14
he	14

with	14
delight	14
and	14
wonder;	14
and	14
take	14
my	14
advice,	14
sir,	14
and,	14
as	14
I	14
said	14
before,	14
read	14
these	14
books	14
and	14
you	14
will	14
see	14
how	14
they	14
will	14
banish	14
any	14
melancholy	14
you	14
may	14
feel	14
and	14
raise	14
your	14
spirits	14
should	14
they	14
be	14
depressed.	14
For	14
myself	14
I	14
can	14
say	14
that	14
since	14
I	14
have	14
been	14
a	14
knight-errant	14
I	14
have	14
become	14
valiant,	14
polite,	14
generous,	14
well-bred,	14
magnanimous,	14
courteous,	14
dauntless,	14
gentle,	14
patient,	14
and	14
have	14
learned	14
to	14
bear	14
hardships,	14
imprisonments,	14
and	14
enchantments;	14
and	14
though	14
it	14
be	14
such	14
a	14
short	14
time	14
since	14
I	14
have	14
seen	14
myself	14
shut	14
up	14
in	14
a	14
cage	14
like	14
a	14
madman,	14
I	14
hope	14
by	14
the	14
might	14
of	14
my	14
arm,	14
if	14
heaven	14
aid	14
me	14
and	14
fortune	14
thwart	14
me	14
not,	14
to	14
see	14
myself	14
king	14
of	14
some	14
kingdom	14
where	14
I	14
may	14
be	14
able	14
to	14
show	14
the	14
gratitude	14
and	14
generosity	14
that	14
dwell	14
in	14
my	14
heart;	14
for	14
by	14
my	14
faith,	14
señor,	14
the	14
poor	14
man	14
is	14
incapacitated	14
from	14
showing	14
the	14
virtue	14
of	14
generosity	14
to	14
anyone,	14
though	14
he	14
may	14
possess	14
it	14
in	14
the	14
highest	14
degree;	14
and	14
gratitude	14
that	14
consists	14
of	14
disposition	14
only	14
is	14
a	14
dead	14
thing,	14
just	14
as	14
faith	14
without	14
works	14
is	14
dead.	14
For	14
this	14
reason	14
I	14
should	14
be	14
glad	14
were	14
fortune	14
soon	14
to	14
offer	14
me	14
some	14
opportunity	14
of	14
making	14
myself	14
an	14
emperor,	14
so	14
as	14
to	14
show	14
my	14
heart	14
in	14
doing	14
good	14
to	14
my	14
friends,	14
particularly	14
to	14
this	14
poor	14
Sancho	14
Panza,	14
my	14
squire,	14
who	14
is	14
the	14
best	14
fellow	14
in	14
the	14
world;	14
and	14
I	14
would	14
gladly	14
give	14
him	14
a	14
county	14
I	14
have	14
promised	14
him	14
this	14
ever	14
so	14
long,	14
only	14
that	14
I	14
am	14
afraid	14
he	14
has	14
not	14
the	14
capacity	14
to	14
govern	14
his	14
realm.”	14
Sancho	14
partly	14
heard	14
these	14
last	14
words	14
of	14
his	14
master,	14
and	14
said	14
to	14
him,	14
“Strive	14
hard	14
you,	14
Señor	14
Don	14
Quixote,	14
to	14
give	14
me	14
that	14
county	14
so	14
often	14
promised	14
by	14
you	14
and	14
so	14
long	14
looked	14
for	14
by	14
me,	14
for	14
I	14
promise	14
you	14
there	14
will	14
be	14
no	14
want	14
of	14
capacity	14
in	14
me	14
to	14
govern	14
it;	14
and	14
even	14
if	14
there	14
is,	14
I	14
have	14
heard	14
say	14
there	14
are	14
men	14
in	14
the	14
world	14
who	14
farm	14
seigniories,	14
paying	14
so	14
much	14
a	14
year,	14
and	14
they	14
themselves	14
taking	14
charge	14
of	14
the	14
government,	14
while	14
the	14
lord,	14
with	14
his	14
legs	14
stretched	14
out,	14
enjoys	14
the	14
revenue	14
they	14
pay	14
him,	14
without	14
troubling	14
himself	14
about	14
anything	14
else.	14
That’s	14
what	14
I’ll	14
do,	14
and	14
not	14
stand	14
haggling	14
over	14
trifles,	14
but	14
wash	14
my	14
hands	14
at	14
once	14
of	14
the	14
whole	14
business,	14
and	14
enjoy	14
my	14
rents	14
like	14
a	14
duke,	14
and	14
let	14
things	14
go	14
their	14
own	14
way.”	14
“That,	14
brother	14
Sancho,”	14
said	14
the	14
canon,	14
“only	14
holds	14
good	14
as	14
far	14
as	14
the	14
enjoyment	14
of	14
the	14
revenue	14
goes;	14
but	14
the	14
lord	14
of	14
the	14
seigniory	14
must	14
attend	14
to	14
the	14
administration	14
of	14
justice,	14
and	14
here	14
capacity	14
and	14
sound	14
judgment	14
come	14
in,	14
and	14
above	14
all	14
a	14
firm	14
determination	14
to	14
find	14
out	14
the	14
truth;	14
for	14
if	14
this	14
be	14
wanting	14
in	14
the	14
beginning,	14
the	14
middle	14
and	14
the	14
end	14
will	14
always	14
go	14
wrong;	14
and	14
God	14
as	14
commonly	14
aids	14
the	14
honest	14
intentions	14
of	14
the	14
simple	14
as	14
he	14
frustrates	14
the	14
evil	14
designs	14
of	14
the	14
crafty.”	14
“I	14
don’t	14
understand	14
those	14
philosophies,”	14
returned	14
Sancho	14
Panza;	14
“all	14
I	14
know	14
is	14
I	14
would	14
I	14
had	14
the	14
county	14
as	14
soon	14
as	14
I	14
shall	14
know	14
how	14
to	14
govern	14
it;	14
for	14
I	14
have	14
as	14
much	14
soul	14
as	14
another,	14
and	14
as	14
much	14
body	14
as	14
anyone,	14
and	14
I	14
shall	14
be	14
as	14
much	14
king	14
of	14
my	14
realm	14
as	14
any	14
other	14
of	14
his;	14
and	14
being	14
so	14
I	14
should	14
do	14
as	14
I	14
liked,	14
and	14
doing	14
as	14
I	14
liked	14
I	14
should	14
please	14
myself,	14
and	14
pleasing	14
myself	14
I	14
should	14
be	14
content,	14
and	14
when	14
one	14
is	14
content	14
he	14
has	14
nothing	14
more	14
to	14
desire,	14
and	14
when	14
one	14
has	14
nothing	14
more	14
to	14
desire	14
there	14
is	14
an	14
end	14
of	14
it;	14
so	14
let	14
the	14
county	14
come,	14
and	14
God	14
be	14
with	14
you,	14
and	14
let	14
us	14
see	14
one	14
another,	14
as	14
one	14
blind	14
man	14
said	14
to	14
the	14
other.”	14
“That	14
is	14
not	14
bad	14
philosophy	14
thou	14
art	14
talking,	14
Sancho,”	14
said	14
the	14
canon;	14
“but	14
for	14
all	14
that	14
there	14
is	14
a	14
good	14
deal	14
to	14
be	14
said	14
on	14
this	14
matter	14
of	14
counties.”	14
To	14
which	14
Don	14
Quixote	14
returned,	14
“I	14
know	14
not	14
what	14
more	14
there	14
is	14
to	14
be	14
said;	14
I	14
only	14
guide	14
myself	14
by	14
the	14
example	14
set	14
me	14
by	14
the	14
great	14
Amadis	14
of	14
Gaul,	14
when	14
he	14
made	14
his	14
squire	14
count	14
of	14
the	14
Insula	14
Firme;	14
and	14
so,	14
without	14
any	14
scruples	14
of	14
conscience,	14
I	14
can	14
make	14
a	14
count	14
of	14
Sancho	14
Panza,	14
for	14
he	14
is	14
one	14
of	14
the	14
best	14
squires	14
that	14
ever	14
knight-errant	14
had.”	14
The	14
canon	14
was	14
astonished	14
at	14
the	14
methodical	14
nonsense	14
(if	14
nonsense	14
be	14
capable	14
of	14
method)	14
that	14
Don	14
Quixote	14
uttered,	14
at	14
the	14
way	14
in	14
which	14
he	14
had	14
described	14
the	14
adventure	14
of	14
the	14
knight	14
of	14
the	14
lake,	14
at	14
the	14
impression	14
that	14
the	14
deliberate	14
lies	14
of	14
the	14
books	14
he	14
read	14
had	14
made	14
upon	14
him,	14
and	14
lastly	14
he	14
marvelled	14
at	14
the	14
simplicity	14
of	14
Sancho,	14
who	14
desired	14
so	14
eagerly	14
to	14
obtain	14
the	14
county	14
his	14
master	14
had	14
promised	14
him.	14
By	14
this	14
time	14
the	14
canon’s	14
servants,	14
who	14
had	14
gone	14
to	14
the	14
inn	14
to	14
fetch	14
the	14
sumpter	14
mule,	14
had	14
returned,	14
and	14
making	14
a	14
carpet	14
and	14
the	14
green	14
grass	14
of	14
the	14
meadow	14
serve	14
as	14
a	14
table,	14
they	14
seated	14
themselves	14
in	14
the	14
shade	14
of	14
some	14
trees	14
and	14
made	14
their	14
repast	14
there,	14
that	14
the	14
carter	14
might	14
not	14
be	14
deprived	14
of	14
the	14
advantage	14
of	14
the	14
spot,	14
as	14
has	14
been	14
already	14
said.	14
As	14
they	14
were	14
eating	14
they	14
suddenly	14
heard	14
a	14
loud	14
noise	14
and	14
the	14
sound	14
of	14
a	14
bell	14
that	14
seemed	14
to	14
come	14
from	14
among	14
some	14
brambles	14
and	14
thick	14
bushes	14
that	14
were	14
close	14
by,	14
and	14
the	14
same	14
instant	14
they	14
observed	14
a	14
beautiful	14
goat,	14
spotted	14
all	14
over	14
black,	14
white,	14
and	14
brown,	14
spring	14
out	14
of	14
the	14
thicket	14
with	14
a	14
goatherd	14
after	14
it,	14
calling	14
to	14
it	14
and	14
uttering	14
the	14
usual	14
cries	14
to	14
make	14
it	14
stop	14
or	14
turn	14
back	14
to	14
the	14
fold.	14
The	14
fugitive	14
goat,	14
scared	14
and	14
frightened,	14
ran	14
towards	14
the	14
company	14
as	14
if	14
seeking	14
their	14
protection	14
and	14
then	14
stood	14
still,	14
and	14
the	14
goatherd	14
coming	14
up	14
seized	14
it	14
by	14
the	14
horns	14
and	14
began	14
to	14
talk	14
to	14
it	14
as	14
if	14
it	14
were	14
possessed	14
of	14
reason	14
and	14
understanding:	14
“Ah	14
wanderer,	15
Spotty,	15
Spotty;	15
how	15
have	15
you	15
gone	15
limping	15
all	15
this	15
time?	15
What	15
wolves	15
have	15
frightened	15
you,	15
my	15
daughter?	15
Won’t	15
you	15
tell	15
me	15
what	15
is	15
the	15
matter,	15
my	15
beauty?	15
But	15
what	15
else	15
can	15
it	15
be	15
except	15
that	15
you	15
are	15
a	15
she,	15
and	15
cannot	15
keep	15
quiet?	15
A	15
plague	15
on	15
your	15
humours	15
and	15
the	15
humours	15
of	15
those	15
you	15
take	15
after!	15
Come	15
back,	15
come	15
back,	15
my	15
darling;	15
and	15
if	15
you	15
will	15
not	15
be	15
so	15
happy,	15
at	15
any	15
rate	15
you	15
will	15
be	15
safe	15
in	15
the	15
fold	15
or	15
with	15
your	15
companions;	15
for	15
if	15
you	15
who	15
ought	15
to	15
keep	15
and	15
lead	15
them,	15
go	15
wandering	15
astray,	15
what	15
will	15
become	15
of	15
them?”	15
The	15
goatherd’s	15
talk	15
amused	15
all	15
who	15
heard	15
it,	15
but	15
especially	15
the	15
canon,	15
who	15
said	15
to	15
him,	15
“As	15
you	15
live,	15
brother,	15
take	15
it	15
easy,	15
and	15
be	15
not	15
in	15
such	15
a	15
hurry	15
to	15
drive	15
this	15
goat	15
back	15
to	15
the	15
fold;	15
for,	15
being	15
a	15
female,	15
as	15
you	15
say,	15
she	15
will	15
follow	15
her	15
natural	15
instinct	15
in	15
spite	15
of	15
all	15
you	15
can	15
do	15
to	15
prevent	15
it.	15
Take	15
this	15
morsel	15
and	15
drink	15
a	15
sup,	15
and	15
that	15
will	15
soothe	15
your	15
irritation,	15
and	15
in	15
the	15
meantime	15
the	15
goat	15
will	15
rest	15
herself,”	15
and	15
so	15
saying,	15
he	15
handed	15
him	15
the	15
loins	15
of	15
a	15
cold	15
rabbit	15
on	15
a	15
fork.	15
The	15
goatherd	15
took	15
it	15
with	15
thanks,	15
and	15
drank	15
and	15
calmed	15
himself,	15
and	15
then	15
said,	15
“I	15
should	15
be	15
sorry	15
if	15
your	15
worships	15
were	15
to	15
take	15
me	15
for	15
a	15
simpleton	15
for	15
having	15
spoken	15
so	15
seriously	15
as	15
I	15
did	15
to	15
this	15
animal;	15
but	15
the	15
truth	15
is	15
there	15
is	15
a	15
certain	15
mystery	15
in	15
the	15
words	15
I	15
used.	15
I	15
am	15
a	15
clown,	15
but	15
not	15
so	15
much	15
of	15
one	15
but	15
that	15
I	15
know	15
how	15
to	15
behave	15
to	15
men	15
and	15
to	15
beasts.”	15
“That	15
I	15
can	15
well	15
believe,”	15
said	15
the	15
curate,	15
“for	15
I	15
know	15
already	15
by	15
experience	15
that	15
the	15
woods	15
breed	15
men	15
of	15
learning,	15
and	15
shepherds’	15
huts	15
harbour	15
philosophers.”	15
“At	15
all	15
events,	15
señor,”	15
returned	15
the	15
goatherd,	15
“they	15
shelter	15
men	15
of	15
experience;	15
and	15
that	15
you	15
may	15
see	15
the	15
truth	15
of	15
this	15
and	15
grasp	15
it,	15
though	15
I	15
may	15
seem	15
to	15
put	15
myself	15
forward	15
without	15
being	15
asked,	15
I	15
will,	15
if	15
it	15
will	15
not	15
tire	15
you,	15
gentlemen,	15
and	15
you	15
will	15
give	15
me	15
your	15
attention	15
for	15
a	15
little,	15
tell	15
you	15
a	15
true	15
story	15
which	15
will	15
confirm	15
this	15
gentleman’s	15
word	15
(and	15
he	15
pointed	15
to	15
the	15
curate)	15
as	15
well	15
as	15
my	15
own.”	15
To	15
this	15
Don	15
Quixote	15
replied,	15
“Seeing	15
that	15
this	15
affair	15
has	15
a	15
certain	15
colour	15
of	15
chivalry	15
about	15
it,	15
I	15
for	15
my	15
part,	15
brother,	15
will	15
hear	15
you	15
most	15
gladly,	15
and	15
so	15
will	15
all	15
these	15
gentlemen,	15
from	15
the	15
high	15
intelligence	15
they	15
possess	15
and	15
their	15
love	15
of	15
curious	15
novelties	15
that	15
interest,	15
charm,	15
and	15
entertain	15
the	15
mind,	15
as	15
I	15
feel	15
quite	15
sure	15
your	15
story	15
will	15
do.	15
So	15
begin,	15
friend,	15
for	15
we	15
are	15
all	15
prepared	15
to	15
listen.”	15
“I	15
draw	15
my	15
stakes,”	15
said	15
Sancho,	15
“and	15
will	15
retreat	15
with	15
this	15
pasty	15
to	15
the	15
brook	15
there,	15
where	15
I	15
mean	15
to	15
victual	15
myself	15
for	15
three	15
days;	15
for	15
I	15
have	15
heard	15
my	15
lord,	15
Don	15
Quixote,	15
say	15
that	15
a	15
knight-errant’s	15
squire	15
should	15
eat	15
until	15
he	15
can	15
hold	15
no	15
more,	15
whenever	15
he	15
has	15
the	15
chance,	15
because	15
it	15
often	15
happens	15
them	15
to	15
get	15
by	15
accident	15
into	15
a	15
wood	15
so	15
thick	15
that	15
they	15
cannot	15
find	15
a	15
way	15
out	15
of	15
it	15
for	15
six	15
days;	15
and	15
if	15
the	15
man	15
is	15
not	15
well	15
filled	15
or	15
his	15
alforjas	15
well	15
stored,	15
there	15
he	15
may	15
stay,	15
as	15
very	15
often	15
he	15
does,	15
turned	15
into	15
a	15
dried	15
mummy.”	15
“Thou	15
art	15
in	15
the	15
right	15
of	15
it,	15
Sancho,”	15
said	15
Don	15
Quixote;	15
“go	15
where	15
thou	15
wilt	15
and	15
eat	15
all	15
thou	15
canst,	15
for	15
I	15
have	15
had	15
enough,	15
and	15
only	15
want	15
to	15
give	15
my	15
mind	15
its	15
refreshment,	15
as	15
I	15
shall	15
by	15
listening	15
to	15
this	15
good	15
fellow’s	15
story.”	15
“It	15
is	15
what	15
we	15
shall	15
all	15
do,”	15
said	15
the	15
canon;	15
and	15
then	15
begged	15
the	15
goatherd	15
to	15
begin	15
the	15
promised	15
tale.	15
The	15
goatherd	15
gave	15
the	15
goat	15
which	15
he	15
held	15
by	15
the	15
horns	15
a	15
couple	15
of	15
slaps	15
on	15
the	15
back,	15
saying,	15
“Lie	15
down	15
here	15
beside	15
me,	15
Spotty,	15
for	15
we	15
have	15
time	15
enough	15
to	15
return	15
to	15
our	15
fold.”	15
The	15
goat	15
seemed	15
to	15
understand	15
him,	15
for	15
as	15
her	15
master	15
seated	15
himself,	15
she	15
stretched	15
herself	15
quietly	15
beside	15
him	15
and	15
looked	15
up	15
in	15
his	15
face	15
to	15
show	15
him	15
she	15
was	15
all	15
attention	15
to	15
what	15
he	15
was	15
going	15
to	15
say,	15
and	15
then	15
in	15
these	15
words	15
he	15
began	15
his	15
story.	15

Three	15
leagues	15
from	15
this	15
valley	15
there	15
is	15
a	15
village	15
which,	15
though	15
small,	15
is	15
one	15
of	15
the	15
richest	15
in	15
all	15
this	15
neighbourhood,	15
and	15
in	15
it	15
there	15
lived	15
a	15
farmer,	15
a	15
very	15
worthy	15
man,	15
and	15
so	15
much	15
respected	15
that,	15
although	15
to	15
be	15
so	15
is	15
the	15
natural	15
consequence	15
of	15
being	15
rich,	15
he	15
was	15
even	15
more	15
respected	15
for	15
his	15
virtue	15
than	15
for	15
the	15
wealth	15
he	15
had	15
acquired.	15
But	15
what	15
made	15
him	15
still	15
more	15
fortunate,	15
as	15
he	15
said	15
himself,	15
was	15
having	15
a	15
daughter	15
of	15
such	15
exceeding	15
beauty,	15
rare	15
intelligence,	15
gracefulness,	15
and	15
virtue,	15
that	15
everyone	15
who	15
knew	15
her	15
and	15
beheld	15
her	15
marvelled	15
at	15
the	15
extraordinary	15
gifts	15
with	15
which	15
heaven	15
and	15
nature	15
had	15
endowed	15
her.	15
As	15
a	15
child	15
she	15
was	15
beautiful,	15
she	15
continued	15
to	15
grow	15
in	15
beauty,	15
and	15
at	15
the	15
age	15
of	15
sixteen	15
she	15
was	15
most	15
lovely.	15
The	15
fame	15
of	15
her	15
beauty	15
began	15
to	15
spread	15
abroad	15
through	15
all	15
the	15
villages	15
around—but	15
why	15
do	15
I	15
say	15
the	15
villages	15
around,	15
merely,	15
when	15
it	15
spread	15
to	15
distant	15
cities,	15
and	15
even	15
made	15
its	15
way	15
into	15
the	15
halls	15
of	15
royalty	15
and	15
reached	15
the	15
ears	15
of	15
people	15
of	15
every	15
class,	15
who	15
came	15
from	15
all	15
sides	15
to	15
see	15
her	15
as	15
if	15
to	15
see	15
something	15
rare	15
and	15
curious,	15
or	15
some	15
wonder-working	15
image?	15
Her	15
father	15
watched	15
over	15
her	15
and	15
she	15
watched	15
over	15
herself;	15
for	15
there	15
are	15
no	15
locks,	15
or	15
guards,	15
or	15
bolts	15
that	15
can	15
protect	15
a	15
young	15
girl	15
better	15
than	15
her	15
own	15
modesty.	15
The	15
wealth	15
of	15
the	15
father	15
and	15
the	15
beauty	15
of	15
the	15
daughter	15
led	15
many	15
neighbours	15
as	15
well	15
as	15
strangers	15
to	15
seek	15
her	15
for	15
a	15
wife;	15
but	15
he,	15
as	15
one	15
might	15
well	15
be	15
who	15
had	15
the	15
disposal	15
of	15
so	15
rich	15
a	15
jewel,	15
was	15
perplexed	15
and	15
unable	15
to	15
make	15
up	15
his	15
mind	15
to	15
which	15
of	15
her	15
countless	15
suitors	15
he	15
should	15
entrust	15
her.	15
I	15
was	15
one	15
among	15
the	15
many	15
who	15
felt	15
a	15
desire	15
so	15
natural,	15
and,	15
as	15
her	15
father	15
knew	15
who	15
I	15
was,	15
and	15
I	15
was	15
of	15
the	15
same	15
town,	15
of	15
pure	15
blood,	15
in	15
the	15
bloom	15
of	15
life,	15
and	15
very	15
rich	15
in	15
possessions,	15
I	15
had	15
great	15
hopes	15
of	15
success.	15
There	15
was	15
another	15
of	15
the	15
same	15
place	15
and	15
qualifications	15
who	15
also	15
sought	15
her,	15
and	15
this	15
made	15
her	15
father’s	15
choice	15
hang	15
in	15
the	15
balance,	15
for	15
he	15
felt	15
that	15
on	15
either	15
of	15
us	15
his	15
daughter	15
would	15
be	15
well	15
bestowed;	15
so	15
to	15
escape	15
from	15
this	15
state	15
of	15
perplexity	15
he	15
resolved	15
to	15
refer	15
the	15
matter	15
to	15
Leandra	15
(for	15
that	15
is	15
the	15
name	15
of	15
the	15
rich	15
damsel	15
who	15
has	15
reduced	15
me	15
to	15
misery),	15
reflecting	15
that	15
as	15
we	15
were	15
both	15
equal	15
it	15
would	15
be	15
best	15
to	15
leave	15
it	15
to	15
his	15
dear	15
daughter	15
to	15
choose	15
according	15
to	15
her	15
inclination—a	15
course	15
that	15
is	15
worthy	15
of	15
imitation	15
by	15
all	15
fathers	15
who	15
wish	15
to	15
settle	15
their	15
children	15
in	15
life.	15
I	15
do	15
not	15
mean	15
that	15
they	15
ought	15
to	15
leave	15
them	15
to	15
make	15
a	15
choice	15
of	15
what	15
is	15
contemptible	15
and	15
bad,	15
but	15
that	15
they	15
should	15
place	15
before	15
them	15
what	15
is	15
good	15
and	15
then	15
allow	15
them	15
to	15
make	15
a	15
good	15
choice	15
as	15
they	15
please.	15
I	15
do	15
not	15
know	15
which	15
Leandra	15
chose;	15
I	15
only	15
know	15
her	15
father	15
put	15
us	15
both	15
off	15
with	15
the	15
tender	15
age	15
of	15
his	15
daughter	15
and	15
vague	15
words	15
that	15
neither	15
bound	15
him	15
nor	15
dismissed	15
us.	15
My	15
rival	15
is	15
called	15
Anselmo	15
and	15
I	15
myself	15
Eugenio—that	15
you	15
may	15
know	15
the	15
names	15
of	15
the	15
personages	15
that	15
figure	15
in	15
this	15
tragedy,	15
the	15
end	15
of	15
which	15
is	15
still	15
in	15
suspense,	15
though	15
it	15
is	15
plain	15
to	15
see	15
it	15
must	15
be	15
disastrous.	15
About	15
this	15
time	15
there	15
arrived	15
in	15
our	15
town	15
one	15
Vicente	15
de	15
la	15
Roca,	15
the	15
son	15
of	15
a	15
poor	15
peasant	15
of	15
the	15
same	15
town,	15
the	15
said	15
Vicente	15
having	15
returned	15
from	15
service	15
as	15
a	15
soldier	15
in	15
Italy	15
and	15
divers	15
other	15
parts.	15
A	15
captain	15
who	15
chanced	15
to	15
pass	15
that	15
way	15
with	15
his	15
company	15
had	15
carried	15
him	15
off	15
from	15
our	15
village	15
when	15
he	15
was	15
a	15
boy	15
of	15
about	15
twelve	15
years,	15
and	15
now	15
twelve	15
years	15
later	15
the	15
young	15
man	15
came	15
back	15
in	15
a	15
soldier’s	15
uniform,	15
arrayed	15
in	15
a	15
thousand	15
colours,	15
and	15
all	15
over	15
glass	15
trinkets	15
and	15
fine	15
steel	15
chains.	15
To-day	15
he	15
would	15
appear	15
in	15
one	15
gay	15
dress,	15
to-morrow	15
in	15
another;	15
but	15
all	15
flimsy	15
and	15
gaudy,	15
of	15
little	15
substance	15
and	15
less	15
worth.	15
The	15
peasant	15
folk,	15
who	15
are	15
naturally	15
malicious,	15
and	15
when	15
they	15
have	15
nothing	15
to	15
do	15
can	15
be	15
malice	15
itself,	15
remarked	15
all	15
this,	15
and	15
took	15
note	15
of	15
his	15
finery	15
and	15
jewellery,	15
piece	15
by	15
piece,	15
and	15
discovered	15
that	15
he	15
had	15
three	15
suits	15
of	15
different	15
colours,	15
with	15
garters	15
and	15
stockings	15
to	15
match;	15
but	15
he	15
made	15
so	15
many	15
arrangements	15
and	15
combinations	15
out	15
of	15
them,	15
that	15
if	15
they	15
had	15
not	15
counted	15
them,	15
anyone	15
would	15
have	15
sworn	15
that	15
he	15
had	15
made	15
a	15
display	15
of	15
more	15
than	15
ten	15
suits	15
of	15
clothes	15
and	15
twenty	15
plumes.	15
Do	15
not	15
look	15
upon	15
all	15
this	15
that	15
I	15
am	15
telling	15
you	15
about	15
the	15
clothes	15
as	15
uncalled	15
for	15
or	15
spun	15
out,	15
for	15
they	15
have	15
a	15
great	15
deal	15
to	15
do	15
with	15
the	15
story.	15
He	15
used	15
to	15
seat	15
himself	15
on	15
a	15
bench	15
under	15
the	15
great	15
poplar	15
in	15
our	15
plaza,	15
and	15
there	15
he	15
would	15
keep	15
us	15
all	15
hanging	15
open-mouthed	15
on	15
the	15
stories	15
he	15
told	15
us	15
of	15
his	15
exploits.	15
There	15
was	15
no	15
country	15
on	15
the	15
face	15
of	15
the	15
globe	15
he	15
had	15
not	15
seen,	15
nor	15
battle	15
he	15
had	15
not	15
been	15
engaged	15
in;	15
he	15
had	15
killed	15
more	15
Moors	15
than	15
there	15
are	15
in	15
Morocco	15
and	15
Tunis,	15
and	15
fought	15
more	15
single	15
combats,	15
according	15
to	15
his	15
own	15
account,	15
than	15
Garcilaso,	15
Diego	15
García	15
de	15
Paredes	15
and	15
a	15
thousand	15
others	15
he	15
named,	15
and	15
out	15
of	15
all	15
he	15
had	15
come	15
victorious	15
without	15
losing	15
a	15
drop	15
of	15
blood.	15
On	15
the	15
other	15
hand	15
he	15
showed	15
marks	15
of	15
wounds,	15
which,	15
though	15
they	15
could	15
not	15
be	15
made	15
out,	15
he	15
said	15
were	15
gunshot	15
wounds	15
received	15
in	15
divers	15
encounters	15
and	15
actions.	15
Lastly,	15
with	15
monstrous	15
impudence	15
he	15
used	15
to	15
say	15
“you”	15
to	15
his	15
equals	15
and	15
even	15
those	15
who	15
knew	15
what	15
he	15
was,	15
and	15
declare	15
that	15
his	15
arm	15
was	15
his	15
father	15
and	15
his	15
deeds	15
his	15
pedigree,	15
and	15
that	15
being	15
a	15
soldier	15
he	15
was	15
as	15
good	15
as	15
the	15
king	15
himself.	15
And	15
to	15
add	15
to	15
these	15
swaggering	15
ways	15
he	15
was	15
a	15
trifle	15
of	15
a	15
musician,	15
and	15
played	15
the	15
guitar	15
with	15
such	15
a	15
flourish	15
that	15
some	15
said	15
he	15
made	15
it	15
speak;	15
nor	15
did	15
his	15
accomplishments	15
end	15
here,	15
for	15
he	15
was	15
something	15
of	15
a	15
poet	15
too,	15
and	15
on	15
every	15
trifle	15
that	15
happened	15
in	15
the	15
town	15
he	15
made	15
a	15
ballad	15
a	15
league	15
long.	15

This	15
soldier,	15
then,	15
that	15
I	15
have	15
described,	15
this	15
Vicente	15
de	15
la	15
Roca,	15
this	15
bravo,	15
gallant,	15
musician,	15
poet,	15
was	15
often	15
seen	15
and	15
watched	15
by	15
Leandra	15
from	15
a	15
window	15
of	15
her	15
house	15
which	15
looked	15
out	15
on	15
the	15
plaza.	15
The	15
glitter	15
of	15
his	15
showy	15
attire	15
took	15
her	15
fancy,	15
his	15
ballads	15
bewitched	15
her	15
(for	15
he	15
gave	15
away	15
twenty	15
copies	15
of	15
every	15
one	15
he	15
made),	15
the	15
tales	15
of	15
his	15
exploits	15
which	15
he	15
told	15
about	15
himself	15
came	15
to	15
her	15
ears;	15
and	15
in	15
short,	15
as	15
the	15
devil	15
no	15
doubt	15
had	15
arranged	15
it,	15
she	15
fell	15
in	15
love	15
with	15
him	15
before	15
the	15
presumption	15
of	15
making	15
love	15
to	15
her	15
had	15
suggested	15
itself	15
to	15
him;	15
and	15
as	15
in	15
love-affairs	15
none	15
are	15
more	15
easily	15
brought	15
to	15
an	15
issue	15
than	15
those	15
which	15
have	15
the	15
inclination	15
of	15
the	15
lady	15
for	15
an	15
ally,	15
Leandra	15
and	15
Vicente	15
came	15
to	15
an	15
understanding	15
without	15
any	15
difficulty;	15
and	15
before	15
any	15
of	15
her	15
numerous	15
suitors	15
had	15
any	15
suspicion	15
of	15
her	15
design,	15
she	15
had	15
already	15
carried	15
it	15
into	15
effect,	15
having	15
left	15
the	15
house	15
of	15
her	15
dearly	15
beloved	15
father	15
(for	15
mother	15
she	15
had	15
none),	15
and	15
disappeared	15
from	15
the	15
village	15
with	15
the	15
soldier,	15
who	15
came	15
more	15
triumphantly	15
out	15
of	15
this	15
enterprise	15
than	15
out	15
of	15
any	15
of	15
the	15
large	15
number	15
he	15
laid	15
claim	15
to.	15
All	15
the	15
village	15
and	15
all	15
who	15
heard	15
of	15
it	15
were	15
amazed	15
at	15
the	15
affair;	15
I	15
was	15
aghast,	15
Anselmo	15
thunderstruck,	15
her	15
father	15
full	15
of	15
grief,	15
her	15
relations	15
indignant,	15
the	15
authorities	15
all	15
in	15
a	15
ferment,	15
the	15
officers	15
of	15
the	15
Brotherhood	15
in	15
arms.	15
They	15
scoured	15
the	15
roads,	15
they	15
searched	15
the	15
woods	15
and	15
all	15
quarters,	15
and	15
at	15
the	15
end	15
of	15
three	15
days	15
they	15
found	15
the	15
flighty	15
Leandra	15
in	15
a	15
mountain	15
cave,	15
stript	15
to	15
her	15
shift,	15
and	15
robbed	15
of	15
all	15
the	15
money	15
and	15
precious	15
jewels	15
she	15
had	15
carried	15
away	15
from	15
home	15
with	15
her.	15

They	15
brought	15
her	15
back	15
to	15
her	15
unhappy	15
father,	15
and	15
questioned	15
her	15
as	15
to	15
her	15
misfortune,	15
and	15
she	15
confessed	15
without	15
pressure	15
that	15
Vicente	15
de	15
la	15
Roca	15
had	15
deceived	15
her,	15
and	15
under	15
promise	15
of	15
marrying	15
her	15
had	15
induced	15
her	15
to	15
leave	15
her	15
father’s	15
house,	15
as	15
he	15
meant	15
to	15
take	15
her	15
to	15
the	15
richest	15
and	15
most	15
delightful	15
city	15
in	15
the	15
whole	15
world,	15
which	15
was	15
Naples;	15
and	15
that	15
she,	15
ill-advised	15
and	15
deluded,	15
had	15
believed	15
him,	15
and	15
robbed	15
her	15
father,	15
and	15
handed	15
over	15
all	15
to	15
him	15
the	15
night	15
she	15
disappeared;	15
and	15
that	15
he	15
had	15
carried	15
her	15
away	15
to	15
a	15
rugged	15
mountain	15
and	15
shut	15
her	15
up	15
in	15
the	15
cave	15
where	15
they	15
had	15
found	15
her.	15
She	15
said,	15
moreover,	15
that	15
the	15
soldier,	15
without	15
robbing	15
her	15
of	15
her	15
honour,	15
had	15
taken	15
from	15
her	15
everything	15
she	15
had,	15
and	15
made	15
off,	15
leaving	15
her	15
in	15
the	15
cave,	15
a	15
thing	15
that	15
still	15
further	15
surprised	15
everybody.	15
It	15
was	15
not	15
easy	15
for	15
us	15
to	15
credit	15
the	15
young	15
man’s	15
continence,	15
but	15
she	15
asserted	15
it	15
with	15
such	15
earnestness	15
that	15
it	15
helped	15
to	15
console	15
her	15
distressed	15
father,	15
who	15
thought	15
nothing	15
of	15
what	15
had	15
been	15
taken	15
since	15
the	15
jewel	15
that	15
once	15
lost	15
can	15
never	15
be	15
recovered	15
had	15
been	15
left	15
to	15
his	15
daughter.	15
The	15
same	15
day	15
that	15
Leandra	15
made	15
her	15
appearance	15
her	15
father	15
removed	15
her	15
from	15
our	15
sight	15
and	15
took	15
her	15
away	15
to	15
shut	15
her	15
up	15
in	15
a	15
convent	15
in	15
a	15
town	15
near	15
this,	15
in	15
the	15
hope	15
that	15
time	15
may	15
wear	15
away	15
some	15
of	15
the	15
disgrace	15
she	15
has	15
incurred.	15
Leandra’s	15
youth	15
furnished	15
an	15
excuse	15
for	15
her	15
fault,	15
at	15
least	15
with	15
those	15
to	15
whom	15
it	15
was	15
of	15
no	15
consequence	15
whether	15
she	15
was	15
good	15
or	15
bad;	15
but	15
those	15
who	15
knew	15
her	15
shrewdness	15
and	15
intelligence	15
did	15
not	15
attribute	15
her	15
misdemeanour	15
to	15
ignorance	15
but	15
to	15
wantonness	15
and	15
the	15
natural	15
disposition	15
of	15
women,	15
which	15
is	15
for	15
the	15
most	15
part	15
flighty	15
and	15
ill-regulated.	15
Leandra	15
withdrawn	15
from	15
sight,	15
Anselmo’s	15
eyes	15
grew	15
blind,	15
or	15
at	15
any	15
rate	15
found	15
nothing	15
to	15
look	15
at	15
that	15
gave	15
them	15
any	15
pleasure,	15
and	15
mine	15
were	15
in	15
darkness	15
without	15
a	15
ray	15
of	15
light	15
to	15
direct	15
them	15
to	15
anything	15
enjoyable	15
while	15
Leandra	15
was	15
away.	15
Our	15
melancholy	15
grew	15
greater,	15
our	15
patience	15
grew	15
less;	15
we	15
cursed	15
the	15
soldier’s	15
finery	15
and	15
railed	15
at	15
the	15
carelessness	15
of	15
Leandra’s	15
father.	15
At	15
last	15
Anselmo	15
and	15
I	15
agreed	15
to	15
leave	15
the	15
village	15
and	15
come	15
to	15
this	15
valley;	15
and,	15
he	15
feeding	15
a	15
great	15
flock	15
of	15
sheep	15
of	15
his	15
own,	15
and	15
I	15
a	15
large	15
herd	15
of	15
goats	15
of	15
mine,	15
we	15
pass	15
our	15
life	15
among	15
the	15
trees,	15
giving	15
vent	15
to	15
our	15
sorrows,	15
together	15
singing	15
the	15
fair	15
Leandra’s	15
praises,	15
or	15
upbraiding	15
her,	15
or	15
else	15
sighing	15
alone,	15
and	15
to	15
heaven	15
pouring	15
forth	15
our	15
complaints	15
in	15
solitude.	15
Following	15
our	15
example,	15
many	15
more	15
of	15
Leandra’s	15
lovers	15
have	15
come	15
to	15
these	15
rude	15
mountains	15
and	15
adopted	15
our	15
mode	15
of	15
life,	15
and	15
they	15
are	15
so	15
numerous	15
that	15
one	15
would	15
fancy	15
the	15
place	15
had	15
been	15
turned	15
into	15
the	15
pastoral	15
Arcadia,	15
so	15
full	15
is	15
it	15
of	15
shepherds	15
and	15
sheep-folds;	15
nor	15
is	15
there	15
a	15
spot	15
in	15
it	15
where	15
the	15
name	15
of	15
the	15
fair	15
Leandra	15
is	15
not	15
heard.	15
Here	15
one	15
curses	15
her	15
and	15
calls	15
her	15
capricious,	15
fickle,	15
and	15
immodest,	15
there	15
another	15
condemns	15
her	15
as	15
frail	15
and	15
frivolous;	15
this	15
pardons	15
and	15
absolves	15
her,	15
that	15
spurns	15
and	15
reviles	15
her;	15
one	15
extols	15
her	15
beauty,	15
another	15
assails	15
her	15
character,	15
and	15
in	15
short	15
all	15
abuse	15
her,	15
and	15
all	15
adore	15
her,	15
and	15
to	15
such	15
a	15
pitch	15
has	15
this	15
general	15
infatuation	15
gone	15
that	15
there	15
are	15
some	15
who	15
complain	15
of	15
her	15
scorn	15
without	15
ever	15
having	15
exchanged	15
a	15
word	15
with	15
her,	15
and	15
even	15
some	15
that	15
bewail	15
and	15
mourn	15
the	15
raging	15
fever	15
of	15
jealousy,	15
for	15
which	15
she	15
never	15
gave	15
anyone	15
cause,	15
for,	15
as	15
I	15
have	15
already	15
said,	15
her	15
misconduct	15
was	15
known	15
before	15
her	15
passion.	15
There	15
is	15
no	15
nook	15
among	15
the	15
rocks,	15
no	15
brookside,	15
no	15
shade	15
beneath	15
the	15
trees	15
that	15
is	15
not	15
haunted	15
by	15
some	15
shepherd	15
telling	15
his	15
woes	15
to	15
the	15
breezes;	15
wherever	15
there	15
is	15
an	15
echo	15
it	15
repeats	15
the	15
name	15
of	15
Leandra;	15
the	15
mountains	15
ring	15
with	15
“Leandra,”	15
“Leandra”	15
murmur	15
the	15
brooks,	15
and	15
Leandra	15
keeps	15
us	15
all	15
bewildered	15
and	15
bewitched,	15
hoping	15
without	15
hope	15
and	15
fearing	15
without	15
knowing	15
what	15
we	15
fear.	15
Of	15
all	15
this	15
silly	15
set	15
the	15
one	15
that	15
shows	15
the	15
least	15
and	15
also	15
the	15
most	15
sense	15
is	15
my	15
rival	15
Anselmo,	15
for	15
having	15
so	15
many	15
other	15
things	15
to	15
complain	15
of,	15
he	15
only	15
complains	15
of	15
separation,	15
and	15
to	15
the	15
accompaniment	15
of	15
a	15
rebeck,	15
which	15
he	15
plays	15
admirably,	15
he	15
sings	15
his	15
complaints	15
in	15
verses	15
that	15
show	15
his	15
ingenuity.	15
I	15
follow	15
another,	15
easier,	15
and	15
to	15
my	15
mind	15
wiser	15
course,	15
and	15
that	15
is	15
to	15
rail	15
at	15
the	15
frivolity	15
of	15
women,	15
at	15
their	15
inconstancy,	15
their	15
double	15
dealing,	15
their	15
broken	15
promises,	15
their	15
unkept	15
pledges,	15
and	15
in	15
short	15
the	15
want	15
of	15
reflection	15
they	15
show	15
in	15
fixing	15
their	15
affections	15
and	15
inclinations.	15
This,	15
sirs,	15
was	15
the	15
reason	15
of	15
words	15
and	15
expressions	15
I	15
made	15
use	15
of	15
to	15
this	15
goat	15
when	15
I	15
came	15
up	15
just	15
now;	15
for	15
as	15
she	15
is	15
a	15
female	15
I	15
have	15
a	15
contempt	15
for	15
her,	15
though	15
she	15
is	15
the	15
best	15
in	15
all	15
my	15
fold.	15
This	15
is	15
the	15
story	15
I	15
promised	15
to	15
tell	15
you,	15
and	15
if	15
I	15
have	15
been	15
tedious	15
in	15
telling	15
it,	15
I	15
will	15
not	15
be	15
slow	15
to	15
serve	15
you;	15
my	15
hut	15
is	15
close	15
by,	15
and	15
I	15
have	15
fresh	15
milk	15
and	15
dainty	15
cheese	15
there,	15
as	15
well	15
as	15
a	15
variety	15
of	15
toothsome	15
fruit,	15
no	15
less	15
pleasing	15
to	15
the	15
eye	15
than	15
to	15
the	15
palate.	15

The	15
goatherd’s	15
tale	15
gave	15
great	15
satisfaction	15
to	15
all	15
the	15
hearers,	15
and	15
the	15
canon	15
especially	15
enjoyed	15
it,	15
for	15
he	15
had	15
remarked	15
with	15
particular	15
attention	15
the	15
manner	15
in	15
which	15
it	15
had	15
been	15
told,	15
which	15
was	15
as	15
unlike	15
the	15
manner	15
of	15
a	15
clownish	15
goatherd	15
as	15
it	15
was	15
like	15
that	15
of	15
a	15
polished	15
city	15
wit;	15
and	15
he	15
observed	15
that	15
the	15
curate	15
had	15
been	15
quite	15
right	15
in	15
saying	15
that	15
the	15
woods	15
bred	15
men	15
of	15
learning.	15
They	15
all	15
offered	15
their	15
services	15
to	15
Eugenio	15
but	15
he	15
who	15
showed	15
himself	15
most	15
liberal	15
in	15
this	15
way	15
was	15
Don	15
Quixote,	15
who	15
said	15
to	15
him,	15
“Most	15
assuredly,	15
brother	15
goatherd,	15
if	15
I	15
found	15
myself	15
in	15
a	15
position	15
to	15
attempt	15
any	15
adventure,	15
I	15
would,	15
this	15
very	15
instant,	15
set	15
out	15
on	15
your	15
behalf,	15
and	15
would	15
rescue	15
Leandra	15
from	15
that	15
convent	15
(where	15
no	15
doubt	15
she	15
is	15
kept	15
against	15
her	15
will),	15
in	15
spite	15
of	15
the	15
abbess	15
and	15
all	15
who	15
might	15
try	15
to	15
prevent	15
me,	15
and	15
would	15
place	15
her	15
in	15
your	15
hands	15
to	15
deal	15
with	15
her	15
according	15
to	15
your	15
will	15
and	15
pleasure,	15
observing,	15
however,	15
the	15
laws	15
of	15
chivalry	15
which	15
lay	15
down	15
that	15
no	15
violence	15
of	15
any	15
kind	15
is	15
to	15
be	15
offered	15
to	15
any	15
damsel.	15
But	15
I	15
trust	15
in	15
God	15
our	15
Lord	15
that	15
the	15
might	15
of	15
one	15
malignant	15
enchanter	15
may	15
not	15
prove	15
so	15
great	15
but	15
that	15
the	15
power	15
of	15
another	15
better	15
disposed	15
may	15
prove	15
superior	15
to	15
it,	15
and	15
then	15
I	15
promise	15
you	15
my	15
support	15
and	15
assistance,	15
as	15
I	15
am	15
bound	15
to	15
do	15
by	15
my	15
profession,	15
which	15
is	15
none	15
other	15
than	15
to	15
give	15
aid	15
to	15
the	15
weak	15
and	15
needy.”	15
The	15
goatherd	15
eyed	15
him,	15
and	15
noticing	15
Don	15
Quixote’s	15
sorry	15
appearance	15
and	15
looks,	15
he	15
was	15
filled	15
with	15
wonder,	15
and	15
asked	15
the	15
barber,	15
who	15
was	15
next	15
him,	15
“Señor,	15
who	15
is	15
this	15
man	15
who	15
makes	15
such	15
a	15
figure	15
and	15
talks	15
in	15
such	15
a	15
strain?”	15
“Who	15
should	15
it	15
be,”	15
said	15
the	15
barber,	15
“but	15
the	15
famous	15
Don	15
Quixote	15
of	15
La	15
Mancha,	15
the	15
undoer	15
of	15
injustice,	15
the	15
righter	15
of	15
wrongs,	15
the	15
protector	15
of	15
damsels,	15
the	15
terror	15
of	15
giants,	15
and	15
the	15
winner	15
of	15
battles?”	15
“That,”	15
said	15
the	15
goatherd,	15
“sounds	15
like	15
what	15
one	15
reads	15
in	15
the	15
books	15
of	15
the	15
knights-errant,	15
who	15
did	15
all	15
that	15
you	15
say	15
this	15
man	15
does;	15
though	15
it	15
is	15
my	15
belief	15
that	15
either	15
you	15
are	15
joking,	15
or	15
else	15
this	15
gentleman	15
has	15
empty	15
lodgings	15
in	15
his	15
head.”	15
“You	15
are	15
a	15
great	15
scoundrel,”	15
said	15
Don	15
Quixote,	15
“and	15
it	15
is	15
you	15
who	15
are	15
empty	15
and	15
a	15
fool.	15
I	15
am	15
fuller	15
than	15
ever	15
was	15
the	15
whoreson	15
bitch	15
that	15
bore	15
you;”	15
and	15
passing	15
from	15
words	15
to	15
deeds,	15
he	15
caught	15
up	15
a	15
loaf	15
that	15
was	15
near	15
him	15
and	15
sent	15
it	15
full	15
in	15
the	15
goatherd’s	15
face,	15
with	15
such	15
force	15
that	15
he	15
flattened	15
his	15
nose;	15
but	15
the	15
goatherd,	15
who	15
did	15
not	15
understand	15
jokes,	15
and	15
found	15
himself	15
roughly	15
handled	15
in	15
such	15
good	15
earnest,	15
paying	15
no	15
respect	15
to	15
carpet,	15
tablecloth,	15
or	15
diners,	15
sprang	15
upon	15
Don	15
Quixote,	15
and	15
seizing	15
him	15
by	15
the	15
throat	15
with	15
both	15
hands	15
would	15
no	15
doubt	15
have	15
throttled	15
him,	15
had	15
not	15
Sancho	15
Panza	15
that	15
instant	15
come	15
to	15
the	15
rescue,	15
and	15
grasping	15
him	15
by	15
the	15
shoulders	15
flung	15
him	15
down	15
on	15
the	15
table,	15
smashing	15
plates,	15
breaking	15
glasses,	15
and	15
upsetting	15
and	15
scattering	15
everything	15
on	15
it.	15
Don	15
Quixote,	15
finding	15
himself	15
free,	15
strove	15
to	15
get	15
on	15
top	15
of	15
the	15
goatherd,	15
who,	15
with	15
his	15
face	15
covered	15
with	15
blood,	15
and	15
soundly	15
kicked	15
by	15
Sancho,	15
was	15
on	15
all	15
fours	15
feeling	15
about	15
for	15
one	15
of	15
the	15
table-knives	15
to	15
take	15
a	15
bloody	15
revenge	15
with.	15
The	15
canon	15
and	15
the	15
curate,	15
however,	15
prevented	15
him,	15
but	15
the	15
barber	15
so	15
contrived	15
it	15
that	15
he	15
got	15
Don	15
Quixote	15
under	15
him,	15
and	15
rained	15
down	15
upon	15
him	15
such	15
a	15
shower	15
of	15
fisticuffs	15
that	15
the	15
poor	15
knight’s	15
face	15
streamed	15
with	15
blood	15
as	15
freely	15
as	15
his	15
own.	15
The	15
canon	15
and	15
the	15
curate	15
were	15
bursting	15
with	15
laughter,	15
the	15
officers	15
were	15
capering	15
with	15
delight,	15
and	15
both	15
the	15
one	15
and	15
the	15
other	15
hissed	15
them	15
on	15
as	15
they	15
do	15
dogs	15
that	15
are	15
worrying	15
one	15
another	15
in	15
a	15
fight.	15
Sancho	15
alone	15
was	15
frantic,	15
for	15
he	15
could	15
not	15
free	15
himself	15
from	15
the	15
grasp	15
of	15
one	15
of	15
the	15
canon’s	15
servants,	15
who	15
kept	15
him	15
from	15
going	15
to	15
his	15
master’s	15
assistance.	15

At	15
last,	15
while	15
they	15
were	15
all,	15
with	15
the	15
exception	15
of	15
the	15
two	15
bruisers	15
who	15
were	15
mauling	15
each	15
other,	15
in	15
high	15
glee	15
and	15
enjoyment,	15
they	15
heard	15
a	15
trumpet	15
sound	15
a	15
note	15
so	15
doleful	15
that	15
it	15
made	15
them	15
all	15
look	15
in	15
the	15
direction	15
whence	15
the	15
sound	15
seemed	15
to	15
come.	15
But	15
the	15
one	15
that	15
was	15
most	15
excited	15
by	15
hearing	15
it	15
was	15
Don	15
Quixote,	15
who	15
though	15
sorely	15
against	15
his	15
will	15
he	15
was	15
under	15
the	15
goatherd,	15
and	15
something	15
more	15
than	15
pretty	15
well	15
pummelled,	15
said	15
to	15
him,	15
“Brother	15
devil	15
(for	15
it	15
is	15
impossible	15
but	15
that	15
thou	15
must	15
be	15
one	15
since	15
thou	15
hast	15
had	15
might	15
and	15
strength	15
enough	15
to	15
overcome	15
mine),	15
I	15
ask	15
thee	15
to	15
agree	15
to	15
a	15
truce	15
for	15
but	15
one	15
hour	15
for	15
the	15
solemn	15
note	15
of	15
yonder	15
trumpet	15
that	15
falls	15
on	15
our	15
ears	15
seems	15
to	15
me	15
to	15
summon	15
me	15
to	15
some	15
new	15
adventure.”	15
The	15
goatherd,	15
who	15
was	15
by	15
this	15
time	15
tired	15
of	15
pummelling	15
and	15
being	15
pummelled,	15
released	15
him	15
at	15
once,	15
and	15
Don	15
Quixote	15
rising	15
to	15
his	15
feet	15
and	15
turning	15
his	15
eyes	15
to	15
the	15
quarter	15
where	15
the	15
sound	15
had	15
been	15
heard,	15
suddenly	15
saw	15
coming	15
down	15
the	15
slope	15
of	15
a	15
hill	15
several	15
men	15
clad	15
in	15
white	15
like	15
penitents.	15
The	15
fact	15
was	15
that	15
the	15
clouds	15
had	15
that	15
year	15
withheld	15
their	15
moisture	15
from	15
the	15
earth,	15
and	15
in	15
all	15
the	15
villages	15
of	15
the	15
district	15
they	15
were	15
organising	15
processions,	15
rogations,	15
and	15
penances,	15
imploring	15
God	15
to	15
open	15
the	15
hands	15
of	15
his	15
mercy	15
and	15
send	15
the	15
rain;	15
and	15
to	15
this	15
end	15
the	15
people	15
of	15
a	15
village	15
that	15
was	15
hard	15
by	15
were	15
going	15
in	15
procession	15
to	15
a	15
holy	15
hermitage	15
there	15
was	15
on	15
one	15
side	15
of	15
that	15
valley.	15
Don	15
Quixote	15
when	15
he	15
saw	15
the	15
strange	15
garb	15
of	15
the	15
penitents,	15
without	15
reflecting	15
how	15
often	15
he	15
had	15
seen	15
it	15
before,	15
took	15
it	15
into	15
his	15
head	15
that	15
this	15
was	15
a	15
case	15
of	15
adventure,	15
and	15
that	15
it	15
fell	15
to	15
him	15
alone	15
as	15
a	15
knight-errant	15
to	15
engage	15
in	15
it;	15
and	15
he	15
was	15
all	15
the	15
more	15
confirmed	15
in	15
this	15
notion,	15
by	15
the	15
idea	15
that	15
an	15
image	15
draped	15
in	15
black	15
they	15
had	15
with	15
them	15
was	15
some	15
illustrious	15
lady	15
that	15
these	15
villains	15
and	15
discourteous	15
thieves	15
were	15
carrying	15
off	15
by	15
force.	15
As	15
soon	15
as	15
this	15
occurred	15
to	15
him	15
he	15
ran	15
with	15
all	15
speed	15
to	15
Rocinante	15
who	15
was	15
grazing	15
at	15
large,	15
and	15
taking	15
the	15
bridle	15
and	15
the	15
buckler	15
from	15
the	15
saddle-bow,	15
he	15
had	15
him	15
bridled	15
in	15
an	15
instant,	15
and	15
calling	15
to	15
Sancho	15
for	15
his	15
sword	15
he	15
mounted	15
Rocinante,	15
braced	15
his	15
buckler	15
on	15
his	15
arm,	15
and	15
in	15
a	15
loud	15
voice	15
exclaimed	15
to	15
those	15
who	15
stood	15
by,	15
“Now,	15
noble	15
company,	15
ye	15
shall	15
see	15
how	15
important	15
it	15
is	15
that	15
there	15
should	15
be	15
knights	15
in	15
the	15
world	15
professing	15
the	15
order	15
of	15
knight-errantry;	15
now,	15
I	15
say,	15
ye	15
shall	15
see,	15
by	15
the	15
deliverance	15
of	15
that	15
worthy	15
lady	15
who	15
is	15
borne	15
captive	15
there,	15
whether	15
knights-errant	15
deserve	15
to	15
be	15
held	15
in	15
estimation,”	15
and	15
so	15
saying	15
he	15
brought	15
his	15
legs	15
to	15
bear	15
on	15
Rocinante—for	15
he	15
had	15
no	15
spurs—and	15
at	15
a	15
full	15
canter	15
(for	15
in	15
all	15
this	15
veracious	15
history	15
we	15
never	15
read	15
of	15
Rocinante	15
fairly	15
galloping)	15
set	15
off	15
to	15
encounter	15
the	15
penitents,	15
though	15
the	15
curate,	15
the	15
canon,	15
and	15
the	15
barber	15
ran	15
to	15
prevent	15
him.	15
But	15
it	15
was	15
out	15
of	15
their	15
power,	15
nor	15
did	15
he	15
even	15
stop	15
for	15
the	15
shouts	15
of	15
Sancho	15
calling	15
after	15
him,	15
“Where	15
are	15
you	15
going,	15
Señor	15
Don	15
Quixote?	15
What	15
devils	15
have	15
possessed	15
you	15
to	15
set	15
you	15
on	15
against	15
our	15
Catholic	15
faith?	15
Plague	15
take	15
me!	15
mind,	15
that	15
is	15
a	15
procession	15
of	15
penitents,	15
and	15
the	15
lady	15
they	15
are	15
carrying	15
on	15
that	15
stand	15
there	15
is	15
the	15
blessed	15
image	15
of	15
the	15
immaculate	15
Virgin.	15
Take	15
care	15
what	15
you	15
are	15
doing,	15
señor,	15
for	15
this	15
time	15
it	15
may	15
be	15
safely	15
said	15
you	15
don’t	15
know	15
what	15
you	15
are	15
about.”	15
Sancho	15
laboured	15
in	15
vain,	15
for	15
his	15
master	15
was	15
so	15
bent	15
on	15
coming	15
to	15
quarters	15
with	15
these	15
sheeted	15
figures	15
and	15
releasing	15
the	15
lady	15
in	15
black	15
that	15
he	15
did	15
not	15
hear	15
a	15
word;	15
and	15
even	15
had	15
he	15
heard,	15
he	15
would	15
not	15
have	15
turned	15
back	15
if	15
the	15
king	15
had	15
ordered	15
him.	15
He	15
came	15
up	15
with	15
the	15
procession	15
and	15
reined	15
in	15
Rocinante,	15
who	15
was	15
already	15
anxious	15
enough	15
to	15
slacken	15
speed	15
a	15
little,	15
and	15
in	15
a	15
hoarse,	15
excited	15
voice	15
he	15
exclaimed,	15
“You	15
who	15
hide	15
your	15
faces,	15
perhaps	15
because	15
you	15
are	15
not	15
good	15
subjects,	15
pay	15
attention	15
and	15
listen	15
to	15
what	15
I	15
am	15
about	15
to	15
say	15
to	15
you.”	15
The	15
first	15
to	15
halt	15
were	15
those	15
who	15
were	15
carrying	15
the	15
image,	15
and	15
one	15
of	15
the	15
four	15
ecclesiastics	15
who	15
were	15
chanting	15
the	15
Litany,	15
struck	15
by	15
the	15
strange	15
figure	15
of	15
Don	15
Quixote,	15
the	15
leanness	15
of	15
Rocinante,	15
and	15
the	15
other	15
ludicrous	15
peculiarities	15
he	15
observed,	15
said	15
in	15
reply	15
to	15
him,	15
“Brother,	15
if	15
you	15
have	15
anything	15
to	15
say	15
to	15
us	15
say	15
it	15
quickly,	15
for	15
these	15
brethren	15
are	15
whipping	15
themselves,	15
and	15
we	15
cannot	15
stop,	15
nor	15
is	15
it	15
reasonable	15
we	15
should	15
stop	15
to	15
hear	15
anything,	15
unless	15
indeed	15
it	15
is	15
short	15
enough	15
to	15
be	15
said	15
in	15
two	15
words.”	15
“I	15
will	15
say	15
it	15
in	15
one,”	15
replied	15
Don	15
Quixote,	15
“and	15
it	15
is	15
this;	15
that	15
at	15
once,	15
this	15
very	15
instant,	15
ye	15
release	15
that	15
fair	15
lady	15
whose	15
tears	15
and	15
sad	15
aspect	15
show	15
plainly	15
that	15
ye	15
are	15
carrying	15
her	15
off	15
against	15
her	15
will,	15
and	15
that	15
ye	15
have	15
committed	15
some	15
scandalous	15
outrage	15
against	15
her;	15
and	15
I,	15
who	15
was	15
born	15
into	15
the	15
world	15
to	15
redress	15
all	15
such	15
like	15
wrongs,	15
will	15
not	15
permit	15
you	15
to	15
advance	15
another	15
step	15
until	15
you	15
have	15
restored	15
to	15
her	15
the	15
liberty	15
she	15
pines	15
for	15
and	15
deserves.”	15
From	15
these	15
words	15
all	15
the	15
hearers	15
concluded	15
that	15
he	15
must	15
be	15
a	15
madman,	15
and	15
began	15
to	15
laugh	15
heartily,	15
and	15
their	15
laughter	15
acted	15
like	15
gunpowder	15
on	15
Don	15
Quixote’s	15
fury,	15
for	15
drawing	15
his	15
sword	15
without	15
another	15
word	15
he	15
made	15
a	15
rush	15
at	15
the	15
stand.	15
One	15
of	15
those	15
who	15
supported	15
it,	15
leaving	15
the	15
burden	15
to	15
his	15
comrades,	15
advanced	15
to	15
meet	15
him,	15
flourishing	15
a	15
forked	15
stick	15
that	15
he	15
had	15
for	15
propping	15
up	15
the	15
stand	15
when	15
resting,	15
and	15
with	15
this	15
he	15
caught	15
a	15
mighty	15
cut	15
Don	15
Quixote	15
made	15
at	15
him	15
that	15
severed	15
it	15
in	15
two;	15
but	15
with	15
the	15
portion	15
that	15
remained	15
in	15
his	15
hand	15
he	15
dealt	15
such	15
a	15
thwack	15
on	15
the	15
shoulder	15
of	15
Don	15
Quixote’s	15
sword	15
arm	15
(which	15
the	15
buckler	15
could	15
not	15
protect	15
against	15
the	15
clownish	15
assault)	15
that	15
poor	15
Don	15
Quixote	15
came	15
to	15
the	15
ground	15
in	15
a	15
sad	15
plight.	15
Sancho	15
Panza,	15
who	15
was	15
coming	15
on	15
close	15
behind	15
puffing	15
and	15
blowing,	15
seeing	15
him	15
fall,	15
cried	15
out	15
to	15
his	15
assailant	15
not	15
to	15
strike	15
him	15
again,	15
for	15
he	15
was	15
a	15
poor	15
enchanted	15
knight,	15
who	15
had	15
never	15
harmed	15
anyone	15
all	15
the	15
days	15
of	15
his	15
life;	15
but	15
what	15
checked	15
the	15
clown	15
was,	15
not	15
Sancho’s	15
shouting,	15
but	15
seeing	15
that	15
Don	15
Quixote	15
did	15
not	15
stir	15
hand	15
or	15
foot;	15
and	15
so,	15
fancying	15
he	15
had	15
killed	15
him,	15
he	15
hastily	15
hitched	15
up	15
his	15
tunic	15
under	15
his	15
girdle	15
and	15
took	15
to	15
his	15
heels	15
across	15
the	15
country	15
like	15
a	15
deer.	15
By	15
this	15
time	15
all	15
Don	15
Quixote’s	15
companions	15
had	15
come	15
up	15
to	15
where	15
he	15
lay;	15
but	15
the	15
processionists	15
seeing	15
them	15
come	15
running,	15
and	15
with	15
them	15
the	15
officers	15
of	15
the	15
Brotherhood	15
with	15
their	15
crossbows,	15
apprehended	15
mischief,	15
and	15
clustering	15
round	15
the	15
image,	15
raised	15
their	15
hoods,	15
and	15
grasped	15
their	15
scourges,	15
as	15
the	15
priests	15
did	15
their	15
tapers,	15
and	15
awaited	15
the	15
attack,	15
resolved	15
to	15
defend	15
themselves	15
and	15
even	15
to	15
take	15
the	15
offensive	15
against	15
their	15
assailants	15
if	15
they	15
could.	15
Fortune,	15
however,	15
arranged	15
the	15
matter	15
better	15
than	15
they	15
expected,	15
for	15
all	15
Sancho	15
did	15
was	15
to	15
fling	15
himself	15
on	15
his	15
master’s	15
body,	15
raising	15
over	15
him	15
the	15
most	15
doleful	15
and	15
laughable	15
lamentation	15
that	15
ever	15
was	15
heard,	15
for	15
he	15
believed	15
he	15
was	15
dead.	15
The	15
curate	15
was	15
known	15
to	15
another	15
curate	15
who	15
walked	15
in	15
the	15
procession,	15
and	15
their	15
recognition	15
of	15
one	15
another	15
set	15
at	15
rest	15
the	15
apprehensions	15
of	15
both	15
parties;	15
the	15
first	15
then	15
told	15
the	15
other	15
in	15
two	15
words	15
who	15
Don	15
Quixote	15
was,	15
and	15
he	15
and	15
the	15
whole	15
troop	15
of	15
penitents	15
went	15
to	15
see	15
if	15
the	15
poor	15
gentleman	15
was	15
dead,	15
and	15
heard	15
Sancho	15
Panza	15
saying,	15
with	15
tears	15
in	15
his	15
eyes,	15
“Oh	15
flower	15
of	15
chivalry,	15
that	15
with	15
one	15
blow	15
of	15
a	15
stick	15
hast	15
ended	15
the	15
course	15
of	15
thy	15
well-spent	15
life!	15
Oh	15
pride	15
of	15
thy	15
race,	15
honour	15
and	15
glory	15
of	15
all	15
La	15
Mancha,	15
nay,	15
of	15
all	15
the	15
world,	15
that	15
for	15
want	15
of	15
thee	15
will	15
be	15
full	15
of	15
evil-doers,	15
no	15
longer	15
in	15
fear	15
of	15
punishment	15
for	15
their	15
misdeeds!	15
Oh	15
thou,	15
generous	15
above	15
all	15
the	15
Alexanders,	15
since	15
for	15
only	15
eight	15
months	15
of	15
service	15
thou	15
hast	15
given	15
me	15
the	15
best	15
island	15
the	15
sea	15
girds	15
or	15
surrounds!	15
Humble	15
with	15
the	15
proud,	15
haughty	15
with	15
the	15
humble,	15
encounterer	15
of	15
dangers,	15
endurer	15
of	15
outrages,	15
enamoured	15
without	15
reason,	15
imitator	15
of	15
the	15
good,	15
scourge	15
of	15
the	15
wicked,	15
enemy	15
of	15
the	15
mean,	15
in	15
short,	15
knight-errant,	15
which	15
is	15
all	15
that	15
can	15
be	15
said!”	15

At	15
the	15
cries	15
and	15
moans	15
of	15
Sancho,	15
Don	15
Quixote	15
came	15
to	15
himself,	15
and	15
the	15
first	15
word	15
he	15
said	15
was,	15
“He	15
who	15
lives	15
separated	15
from	15
you,	15
sweetest	15
Dulcinea,	15
has	15
greater	15
miseries	15
to	15
endure	15
than	15
these.	15
Aid	15
me,	15
friend	15
Sancho,	15
to	15
mount	15
the	15
enchanted	15
cart,	15
for	15
I	15
am	15
not	15
in	15
a	15
condition	15
to	15
press	15
the	15
saddle	15
of	15
Rocinante,	15
as	15
this	15
shoulder	15
is	15
all	15
knocked	15
to	15
pieces.”	15
“That	15
I	15
will	15
do	15
with	15
all	15
my	15
heart,	15
señor,”	15
said	15
Sancho;	15
“and	15
let	15
us	15
return	15
to	15
our	15
village	15
with	15
these	15
gentlemen,	15
who	15
seek	15
your	15
good,	15
and	15
there	15
we	15
will	15
prepare	15
for	15
making	15
another	15
sally,	15
which	15
may	15
turn	15
out	15
more	15
profitable	15
and	15
creditable	15
to	15
us.”	15
“Thou	15
art	15
right,	15
Sancho,”	15
returned	15
Don	15
Quixote;	15
“It	15
will	15
be	15
wise	15
to	15
let	15
the	15
malign	15
influence	15
of	15
the	15
stars	15
which	15
now	15
prevails	15
pass	15
off.”	15
The	15
canon,	15
the	15
curate,	15
and	15
the	15
barber	15
told	15
him	15
he	15
would	15
act	15
very	15
wisely	15
in	15
doing	15
as	15
he	15
said;	15
and	15
so,	15
highly	15
amused	15
at	15
Sancho	15
Panza’s	15
simplicities,	15
they	15
placed	15
Don	15
Quixote	15
in	15
the	15
cart	15
as	15
before.	15
The	15
procession	15
once	15
more	15
formed	15
itself	15
in	15
order	15
and	15
proceeded	15
on	15
its	15
road;	15
the	15
goatherd	15
took	15
his	15
leave	15
of	15
the	15
party;	15
the	15
officers	15
of	15
the	15
Brotherhood	15
declined	15
to	15
go	15
any	15
farther,	15
and	15
the	15
curate	15
paid	15
them	15
what	15
was	15
due	15
to	15
them;	15
the	15
canon	15
begged	15
the	15
curate	15
to	15
let	15
him	15
know	15
how	15
Don	15
Quixote	15
did,	15
whether	15
he	15
was	15
cured	15
of	15
his	15
madness	15
or	15
still	15
suffered	15
from	15
it,	15
and	15
then	15
begged	15
leave	15
to	15
continue	15
his	15
journey;	15
in	15
short,	15
they	15
all	15
separated	15
and	15
went	15
their	15
ways,	15
leaving	15
to	15
themselves	15
the	15
curate	15
and	15
the	15
barber,	15
Don	15
Quixote,	15
Sancho	15
Panza,	15
and	15
the	15
good	15
Rocinante,	15
who	15
regarded	15
everything	15
with	15
as	15
great	15
resignation	15
as	15
his	15
master.	15
The	15
carter	15
yoked	15
his	15
oxen	15
and	15
made	15
Don	15
Quixote	15
comfortable	15
on	15
a	15
truss	15
of	15
hay,	15
and	15
at	15
his	15
usual	15
deliberate	15
pace	15
took	15
the	15
road	15
the	15
curate	15
directed,	15
and	15
at	15
the	15
end	15
of	15
six	15
days	15
they	15
reached	15
Don	15
Quixote’s	15
village,	15
and	15
entered	15
it	15
about	15
the	15
middle	15
of	15
the	15
day,	15
which	15
it	15
so	15
happened	15
was	15
a	15
Sunday,	15
and	15
the	15
people	15
were	15
all	15
in	15
the	15
plaza,	15
through	15
which	15
Don	15
Quixote’s	15
cart	15
passed.	15
They	15
all	15
flocked	15
to	15
see	15
what	15
was	15
in	15
the	15
cart,	15
and	15
when	15
they	15
recognised	15
their	15
townsman	15
they	15
were	15
filled	15
with	15
amazement,	15
and	15
a	15
boy	15
ran	15
off	15
to	15
bring	15
the	15
news	15
to	15
his	15
housekeeper	15
and	15
his	15
niece	15
that	15
their	15
master	15
and	15
uncle	15
had	15
come	15
back	15
all	15
lean	15
and	15
yellow	15
and	15
stretched	15
on	15
a	15
truss	15
of	15
hay	15
on	15
an	15
ox-cart.	15
It	15
was	15
piteous	15
to	15
hear	15
the	15
cries	15
the	15
two	15
good	15
ladies	15
raised,	15
how	15
they	15
beat	15
their	15
breasts	15
and	15
poured	15
out	15
fresh	15
maledictions	15
on	15
those	15
accursed	15
books	15
of	15
chivalry;	15
all	15
which	15
was	15
renewed	15
when	15
they	15
saw	15
Don	15
Quixote	15
coming	15
in	15
at	15
the	15
gate.	15
At	15
the	15
news	15
of	15
Don	15
Quixote’s	15
arrival	15
Sancho	15
Panza’s	15
wife	15
came	15
running,	15
for	15
she	15
by	15
this	15
time	15
knew	15
that	15
her	15
husband	15
had	15
gone	15
away	15
with	15
him	15
as	15
his	15
squire,	15
and	15
on	15
seeing	15
Sancho,	15
the	15
first	15
thing	15
she	15
asked	15
him	15
was	15
if	15
the	15
ass	15
was	15
well.	15
Sancho	15
replied	15
that	15
he	15
was,	15
better	15
than	15
his	15
master	15
was.	15
“Thanks	15
be	15
to	15
God,”	15
said	15
she,	15
“for	15
being	15
so	15
good	15
to	15
me;	15
but	15
now	15
tell	15
me,	15
my	15
friend,	15
what	15
have	15
you	15
made	15
by	15
your	15
squirings?	15
What	15
gown	15
have	15
you	15
brought	15
me	15
back?	15
What	15
shoes	15
for	15
your	15
children?”	15
“I	15
bring	15
nothing	15
of	15
that	15
sort,	15
wife,”	15
said	15
Sancho;	15
“though	15
I	15
bring	15
other	15
things	15
of	15
more	15
consequence	15
and	15
value.”	15
“I	15
am	15
very	15
glad	15
of	15
that,”	15
returned	15
his	15
wife;	15
“show	15
me	15
these	15
things	15
of	15
more	15
value	15
and	15
consequence,	15
my	15
friend;	15
for	15
I	15
want	15
to	15
see	15
them	15
to	15
cheer	15
my	15
heart	15
that	15
has	15
been	15
so	15
sad	15
and	15
heavy	15
all	15
these	15
ages	15
that	15
you	15
have	15
been	15
away.”	15
“I	15
will	15
show	15
them	15
to	15
you	15
at	15
home,	15
wife,”	15
said	15
Sancho;	15
“be	15
content	15
for	15
the	15
present;	15
for	15
if	15
it	15
please	15
God	15
that	15
we	15
should	15
again	15
go	15
on	15
our	15
travels	15
in	15
search	15
of	15
adventures,	15
you	15
will	15
soon	15
see	15
me	15
a	15
count,	15
or	15
governor	15
of	15
an	15
island,	15
and	15
that	15
not	15
one	15
of	15
those	15
everyday	15
ones,	15
but	15
the	15
best	15
that	15
is	15
to	15
be	15
had.”	15
“Heaven	15
grant	15
it,	15
husband,”	15
said	15
she,	15
“for	15
indeed	15
we	15
have	15
need	15
of	15
it.	15
But	15
tell	15
me,	15
what’s	15
this	15
about	15
islands,	15
for	15
I	15
don’t	15
understand	15
it?”	15
“Honey	15
is	15
not	15
for	15
the	15
mouth	15
of	15
the	15
ass,”	15
returned	15
Sancho;	15
“all	15
in	15
good	15
time	15
thou	15
shalt	15
see,	15
wife—nay,	15
thou	15
wilt	15
be	15
surprised	15
to	15
hear	15
thyself	15
called	15
‘your	15
ladyship’	15
by	15
all	15
thy	15
vassals.”	15
“What	15
are	15
you	15
talking	15
about,	15
Sancho,	15
with	15
your	15
ladyships,	15
islands,	15
and	15
vassals?”	15
returned	15
Teresa	15
Panza—for	15
so	15
Sancho’s	15
wife	15
was	15
called,	15
though	15
they	15
were	15
not	15
relations,	15
for	15
in	15
La	15
Mancha	15
it	15
is	15
customary	15
for	15
wives	15
to	15
take	15
their	15
husbands’	15
surnames.	15
“Don’t	15
be	15
in	15
such	15
a	15
hurry	15
to	15
know	15
all	15
this,	15
Teresa,”	15
said	15
Sancho;	15
“it	15
is	15
enough	15
that	15
I	15
am	15
telling	15
you	15
the	15
truth,	15
so	15
shut	15
your	15
mouth.	15
But	15
I	15
may	15
tell	15
you	15
this	15
much	15
by	15
the	15
way,	15
that	15
there	15
is	15
nothing	15
in	15
the	15
world	15
more	15
delightful	15
than	15
to	15
be	15
a	15
person	15
of	15
consideration,	15
squire	15
to	15
a	15
knight-errant,	15
and	15
a	15
seeker	15
of	15
adventures.	15
To	15
be	15
sure	15
most	15
of	15
those	15
one	15
finds	15
do	15
not	15
end	15
as	15
pleasantly	15
as	15
one	15
could	15
wish,	15
for	15
out	15
of	15
a	15
hundred,	15
ninety-nine	15
will	15
turn	15
out	15
cross	15
and	15
contrary.	15
I	15
know	15
it	15
by	15
experience,	15
for	15
out	15
of	15
some	15
I	15
came	15
blanketed,	15
and	15
out	15
of	15
others	15
belaboured.	15
Still,	15
for	15
all	15
that,	15
it	15
is	15
a	15
fine	15
thing	15
to	15
be	15
on	15
the	15
look-out	15
for	15
what	15
may	15
happen,	15
crossing	15
mountains,	15
searching	15
woods,	15
climbing	15
rocks,	15
visiting	15
castles,	15
putting	15
up	15
at	15
inns,	15
all	15
at	15
free	15
quarters,	15
and	15
devil	15
take	15
the	15
maravedi	15
to	15
pay.”	15
While	15
this	15
conversation	15
passed	15
between	15
Sancho	15
Panza	15
and	15
his	15
wife,	15
Don	15
Quixote’s	15
housekeeper	15
and	15
niece	15
took	15
him	15
in	15
and	15
undressed	15
him	15
and	15
laid	15
him	15
in	15
his	15
old	15
bed.	15
He	15
eyed	15
them	15
askance,	15
and	15
could	15
not	15
make	15
out	15
where	15
he	15
was.	15
The	15
curate	15
charged	15
his	15
niece	15
to	15
be	15
very	15
careful	15
to	15
make	15
her	15
uncle	15
comfortable	15
and	15
to	15
keep	15
a	15
watch	15
over	15
him	15
lest	15
he	15
should	15
make	15
his	15
escape	15
from	15
them	15
again,	15
telling	15
her	15
what	15
they	15
had	15
been	15
obliged	15
to	15
do	15
to	15
bring	15
him	15
home.	15
On	15
this	15
the	15
pair	15
once	15
more	15
lifted	15
up	15
their	15
voices	15
and	15
renewed	15
their	15
maledictions	15
upon	15
the	15
books	15
of	15
chivalry,	15
and	15
implored	15
heaven	15
to	15
plunge	15
the	15
authors	15
of	15
such	15
lies	15
and	15
nonsense	15
into	15
the	15
midst	15
of	15
the	15
bottomless	15
pit.	15
They	15
were,	15
in	15
short,	15
kept	15
in	15
anxiety	15
and	15
dread	15
lest	15
their	15
uncle	15
and	15
master	15
should	15
give	15
them	15
the	15
slip	15
the	15
moment	15
he	15
found	15
himself	15
somewhat	15
better,	15
and	15
as	15
they	15
feared	15
so	15
it	15
fell	15
out.	15
But	15
the	15
author	15
of	15
this	15
history,	15
though	15
he	15
has	15
devoted	15
research	15
and	15
industry	15
to	15
the	15
discovery	15
of	15
the	15
deeds	15
achieved	15
by	15
Don	15
Quixote	15
in	15
his	15
third	15
sally,	15
has	15
been	15
unable	15
to	15
obtain	15
any	15
information	15
respecting	15
them,	15
at	15
any	15
rate	15
derived	15
from	15
authentic	15
documents;	15
tradition	15
has	15
merely	15
preserved	15
in	15
the	15
memory	15
of	15
La	15
Mancha	15
the	15
fact	15
that	15
Don	15
Quixote,	15
the	15
third	15
time	15
he	15
sallied	15
forth	15
from	15
his	15
home,	15
betook	15
himself	15
to	15
Saragossa,	15
where	15
he	15
was	15
present	15
at	15
some	15
famous	15
jousts	15
which	15
came	15
off	15
in	15
that	15
city,	15
and	15
that	15
he	15
had	15
adventures	15
there	15
worthy	15
of	15
his	15
valour	15
and	15
high	15
intelligence.	15
Of	15
his	15
end	15
and	15
death	15
he	15
could	15
learn	15
no	15
particulars,	15
nor	15
would	15
he	15
have	15
ascertained	15
it	15
or	15
known	15
of	15
it,	15
if	15
good	15
fortune	15
had	15
not	15
produced	15
an	15
old	15
physician	15
for	15
him	15
who	15
had	15
in	15
his	15
possession	15
a	15
leaden	15
box,	15
which,	15
according	15
to	15
his	15
account,	15
had	15
been	15
discovered	15
among	15
the	15
crumbling	15
foundations	15
of	15
an	15
ancient	15
hermitage	15
that	15
was	15
being	15
rebuilt;	15
in	15
which	15
box	15
were	15
found	15
certain	15
parchment	15
manuscripts	15
in	15
Gothic	15
character,	15
but	15
in	15
Castilian	15
verse,	15
containing	15
many	15
of	15
his	15
achievements,	15
and	15
setting	15
forth	15
the	15
beauty	15
of	15
Dulcinea,	15
the	15
form	15
of	15
Rocinante,	15
the	15
fidelity	15
of	15
Sancho	15
Panza,	15
and	15
the	15
burial	15
of	15
Don	15
Quixote	15
himself,	15
together	15
with	15
sundry	15
epitaphs	15
and	15
eulogies	15
on	15
his	15
life	15
and	15
character;	15
but	15
all	15
that	15
could	15
be	15
read	15
and	15
deciphered	15
were	15
those	15
which	15
the	15
trustworthy	15
author	15
of	15
this	15
new	15
and	15
unparalleled	15
history	15
here	15
presents.	15
And	15
the	15
said	15
author	15
asks	15
of	15
those	15
that	15
shall	15
read	15
it	15
nothing	15
in	15
return	15
for	15
the	15
vast	15
toil	15
which	15
it	15
has	15
cost	15
him	15
in	15
examining	15
and	15
searching	15
the	15
Manchegan	15
archives	15
in	15
order	15
to	15
bring	15
it	15
to	15
light,	15
save	15
that	15
they	15
give	15
him	15
the	15
same	15
credit	15
that	15
people	15
of	15
sense	15
give	15
to	15
the	15
books	15
of	15
chivalry	15
that	15
pervade	15
the	15
world	15
and	15
are	15
so	15
popular;	15
for	15
with	15
this	15
he	15
will	15
consider	15
himself	15
amply	15
paid	15
and	15
fully	15
satisfied,	15
and	15
will	15
be	15
encouraged	15
to	15
seek	15
out	15
and	15
produce	15
other	15
histories,	15
if	15
not	15
as	15
truthful,	15
at	15
least	15
equal	15
in	15
invention	15
and	15
not	15
less	15
entertaining.	15
The	15
first	15
words	15
written	15
on	15
the	15
parchment	15
found	15
in	15
the	15
leaden	15
box	15
were	15
these:	15

DEDICATION	15
OF	15
VOLUME	15

TO	15
THE	15
COUNT	15
OF	15
LEMOS:	15
These	15
days	15
past,	15
when	15
sending	15
Your	15
Excellency	15
my	15
plays,	15
that	15
had	15
appeared	15
in	15
print	15
before	15
being	15
shown	15
on	15
the	15
stage,	15
I	15
said,	15
if	15
I	15
remember	15
well,	15
that	15
Don	15
Quixote	15
was	15
putting	15
on	15
his	15
spurs	15
to	15
go	15
and	15
render	15
homage	15
to	15
Your	15
Excellency.	15
Now	15
I	15
say	15
that	15
“with	15
his	15
spurs,	15
he	15
is	15
on	15
his	15
way.”	15
Should	15
he	15
reach	15
destination	15
methinks	15
I	15
shall	15
have	15
rendered	15
some	15
service	15
to	15
Your	15
Excellency,	15
as	15
from	15
many	15
parts	15
I	15
am	15
urged	15
to	15
send	15
him	15
off,	15
so	15
as	15
to	15
dispel	15
the	15
loathing	15
and	15
disgust	15
caused	15
by	15
another	15
Don	15
Quixote	15
who,	15
under	15
the	15
name	15
of	15
Second	15
Part,	15
has	15
run	15
masquerading	15
through	15
the	15
whole	15
world.	15
And	15
he	15
who	15
has	15
shown	15
the	15
greatest	15
longing	15
for	15
him	15
has	15
been	15
the	15
great	15
Emperor	15
of	15
China,	15
who	15
wrote	15
me	15
a	15
letter	15
in	15
Chinese	15
a	15
month	15
ago	15
and	15
sent	15
it	15
by	15
a	15
special	15
courier.	15
He	15
asked	15
me,	15
or	15
to	15
be	15
truthful,	15
he	15
begged	15
me	15
to	15
send	15
him	15
Don	15
Quixote,	15
for	15
he	15
intended	15
to	15
found	15
a	15
college	15
where	15
the	15
Spanish	15
tongue	15
would	15
be	15
taught,	15
and	15
it	15
was	15
his	15
wish	15
that	15
the	15
book	15
to	15
be	15
read	15
should	15
be	15
the	15
History	15
of	15
Don	15
Quixote.	15
He	15
also	15
added	15
that	15
I	15
should	15
go	15
and	15
be	15
the	15
rector	15
of	15
this	15
college.	15
I	15
asked	15
the	15
bearer	15
if	15
His	15
Majesty	15
had	15
afforded	15
a	15
sum	15
in	15
aid	15
of	15
my	15
travel	15
expenses.	15
He	15
answered,	15
“No,	15
not	15
even	15
in	15
thought.”	15
“Then,	15
brother,”	15
I	15
replied,	15
“you	15
can	15
return	15
to	15
your	15
China,	15
post	15
haste	15
or	15
at	15
whatever	15
haste	15
you	15
are	15
bound	15
to	15
go,	15
as	15
I	15
am	15
not	15
fit	15
for	15
so	15
long	15
a	15
travel	15
and,	15
besides	15
being	15
ill,	15
I	15
am	15
very	15
much	15
without	15
money,	15
while	15
Emperor	15
for	15
Emperor	15
and	15
Monarch	15
for	15
Monarch,	15
I	15
have	15
at	15
Naples	15
the	15
great	15
Count	15
of	15
Lemos,	15
who,	15
without	15
so	15
many	15
petty	15
titles	15
of	15
colleges	15
and	15
rectorships,	15
sustains	15
me,	15
protects	15
me	15
and	15
does	15
me	15
more	15
favour	15
than	15
I	15
can	15
wish	15
for.”	15
Thus	15
I	15
gave	15
him	15
his	15
leave	15
and	15
I	15
beg	15
mine	15
from	15
you,	15
offering	15
Your	15
Excellency	15
the	15
“Trabajos	15

a	15

shall	15
finish	15

and	15
which	15
will	15
be	15
either	15
the	15
worst	15
or	15
the	15
best	15

has	15
been	15
composed	15

I	15
mean	15
of	15

intended	15
for	15

I	15

God	15
bless	15
me,	15
gentle	15
(or	15
it	15
may	15
be	15
plebeian)	15
reader,	15
how	15
eagerly	15
must	15
thou	15
be	15
looking	15
forward	15
to	15
this	15
preface,	15
expecting	15
to	15
find	15
there	15
retaliation,	15
scolding,	15
and	15
abuse	15
against	15
the	15
author	15
of	15
the	15
second	15
Don	15
Quixote—I	15
mean	15
him	15
who	15
was,	15
they	15
say,	15
begotten	15
at	15
Tordesillas	15
and	15
born	15
at	15
Tarragona!	15
Well	15
then,	15
the	15
truth	15
is,	15
I	15
am	15
not	15
going	15
to	15
give	15
thee	15
that	15
satisfaction;	15
for,	15
though	15
injuries	15
stir	15
up	15
anger	15
in	15
humbler	15
breasts,	15
in	15
mine	15
the	15
rule	15
must	15
admit	15
of	15
an	15
exception.	15
Thou	15
wouldst	15
have	15
me	15
call	15
him	15
ass,	15
fool,	15
and	15
malapert,	15
but	15
I	15
have	15
no	15
such	15
intention;	15
let	15
his	15
offence	15
be	15
his	15
punishment,	15
with	15
his	15
bread	15
let	15
him	15
eat	15
it,	15
and	15
there’s	15
an	15
end	15
of	15
it.	15
What	15
I	15
cannot	15
help	15
taking	15
amiss	15
is	15
that	15
he	15
charges	15
me	15
with	15
being	15
old	15
and	15
one-handed,	15
as	15
if	15
it	15
had	15
been	15
in	15
my	15
power	15
to	15
keep	15
time	15
from	15
passing	15
over	15
me,	15
or	15
as	15
if	15
the	15
loss	15
of	15
my	15
hand	15
had	15
been	15
brought	15
about	15
in	15
some	15
tavern,	15
and	15
not	15
on	15
the	15
grandest	15
occasion	15
the	15
past	15
or	15
present	15
has	15
seen,	15
or	15
the	15
future	15
can	15
hope	15
to	15
see.	15
If	15
my	15
wounds	15
have	15
no	15
beauty	15
to	15
the	15
beholder’s	15
eye,	15
they	15
are,	15
at	15
least,	15
honourable	15
in	15
the	15
estimation	15
of	15
those	15
who	15
know	15
where	15
they	15
were	15
received;	15
for	15
the	15
soldier	15
shows	15
to	15
greater	15
advantage	15
dead	15
in	15
battle	15
than	15
alive	15
in	15
flight;	15
and	15
so	15
strongly	15
is	15
this	15
my	15
feeling,	15
that	15
if	15
now	15
it	15
were	15
proposed	15
to	15
perform	15
an	15
impossibility	15
for	15
me,	15
I	15
would	15
rather	15
have	15
had	15
my	15
share	15
in	15
that	15
mighty	15
action,	15
than	15
be	15
free	15
from	15
my	15
wounds	15
this	15
minute	15
without	15
having	15
been	15
present	15
at	15
it.	15
Those	15
the	15
soldier	15
shows	15
on	15
his	15
face	15
and	15
breast	15
are	15
stars	15
that	15
direct	15
others	15
to	15
the	15
heaven	15
of	15
honour	15
and	15
ambition	15
of	15
merited	15
praise;	15
and	15
moreover	15
it	15
is	15
to	15
be	15
observed	15
that	15
it	15
is	15
not	15
with	15
grey	15
hairs	15
that	15
one	15
writes,	15
but	15
with	15
the	15
understanding,	15
and	15
that	15
commonly	15
improves	15
with	15
years.	15
I	15
take	15
it	15
amiss,	15
too,	15
that	15
he	15
calls	15
me	15
envious,	15
and	15
explains	15
to	15
me,	15
as	15
if	15
I	15
were	15
ignorant,	15
what	15
envy	15
is;	15
for	15
really	15
and	15
truly,	15
of	15
the	15
two	15
kinds	15
there	15
are,	15
I	15
only	15
know	15
that	15
which	15
is	15
holy,	15
noble,	15
and	15
high-minded;	15
and	15
if	15
that	15
be	15
so,	15
as	15
it	15
is,	15
I	15
am	15
not	15
likely	15
to	15
attack	15
a	15
priest,	15
above	15
all	15
if,	15
in	15
addition,	15
he	15
holds	15
the	15
rank	15
of	15
familiar	15
of	15
the	15
Holy	15
Office.	15
And	15
if	15
he	15
said	15
what	15
he	15
did	15
on	15
account	15
of	15
him	15
on	15
whose	15
behalf	15
it	15
seems	15
he	15
spoke,	15
he	15
is	15
entirely	15
mistaken;	15
for	15
I	15
worship	15
the	15
genius	15
of	15
that	15
person,	15
and	15
admire	15
his	15
works	15
and	15
his	15
unceasing	15
and	15
strenuous	15
industry.	15
After	15
all,	15
I	15
am	15
grateful	15
to	15
this	15
gentleman,	15
the	15
author,	15
for	15
saying	15
that	15
my	15
novels	15
are	15
more	15
satirical	15
than	15
exemplary,	15
but	15
that	15
they	15
are	15
good;	15
for	15
they	15
could	15
not	15
be	15
that	15
unless	15
there	15
was	15
a	15
little	15
of	15
everything	15
in	15
them.	15
I	15
suspect	15
thou	15
wilt	15
say	15
that	15
I	15
am	15
taking	15
a	15
very	15
humble	15
line,	15
and	15
keeping	15
myself	15
too	15
much	15
within	15
the	15
bounds	15
of	15
my	15
moderation,	15
from	15
a	15
feeling	15
that	15
additional	15
suffering	15
should	15
not	15
be	15
inflicted	15
upon	15
a	15
sufferer,	15
and	15
that	15
what	15
this	15
gentleman	15
has	15
to	15
endure	15
must	15
doubtless	15
be	15
very	15
great,	15
as	15
he	15
does	15
not	15
dare	15
to	15
come	15
out	15
into	15
the	15
open	15
field	15
and	15
broad	15
daylight,	15
but	15
hides	15
his	15
name	15
and	15
disguises	15
his	15
country	15
as	15
if	15
he	15
had	15
been	15
guilty	15
of	15
some	15
lese	15
majesty.	15
If	15
perchance	15
thou	15
shouldst	15
come	15
to	15
know	15
him,	15
tell	15
him	15
from	15
me	15
that	15
I	15
do	15
not	15
hold	15
myself	15
aggrieved;	15
for	15
I	15
know	15
well	15
what	15
the	15
temptations	15
of	15
the	15
devil	15
are,	15
and	15
that	15
one	15
of	15
the	15
greatest	15
is	15
putting	15
it	15
into	15
a	15
man’s	15
head	15
that	15
he	15
can	15
write	15
and	15
print	15
a	15
book	15
by	15
which	15
he	15
will	15
get	15
as	15
much	15
fame	15
as	15
money,	15
and	15
as	15
much	15
money	15
as	15
fame;	15
and	15
to	15
prove	15
it	15
I	15
will	15
beg	15
of	15
you,	15
in	15
your	15
own	15
sprightly,	15
pleasant	15
way,	15
to	15
tell	15
him	15
this	15
story.	15
There	15
was	15
a	15
madman	15
in	15
Seville	15
who	15
took	15
to	15
one	15
of	15
the	15
drollest	15
absurdities	15
and	15
vagaries	15
that	15
ever	15
madman	15
in	15
the	15
world	15
gave	15
way	15
to.	15
It	15
was	15
this:	15
he	15
made	15
a	15
tube	15
of	15
reed	15
sharp	15
at	15
one	15
end,	15
and	15
catching	15
a	15
dog	15
in	15
the	15
street,	15
or	15
wherever	15
it	15
might	15
be,	15
he	15
with	15
his	15
foot	15
held	15
one	15
of	15
its	15
legs	15
fast,	15
and	15
with	15
his	15
hand	15
lifted	15
up	15
the	15
other,	15
and	15
as	15
best	15
he	15
could	15
fixed	15
the	15
tube	15
where,	15
by	15
blowing,	15
he	15
made	15
the	15
dog	15
as	15
round	15
as	15
a	15
ball;	15
then	15
holding	15
it	15
in	15
this	15
position,	15
he	15
gave	15
it	15
a	15
couple	15
of	15
slaps	15
on	15
the	15
belly,	15
and	15
let	15
it	15
go,	15
saying	15
to	15
the	15
bystanders	15
(and	15
there	15
were	15
always	15
plenty	15
of	15
them):	15
“Do	15
your	15
worships	15
think,	15
now,	15
that	15
it	15
is	15
an	15
easy	15
thing	15
to	15
blow	15
up	15
a	15
dog?”—Does	15
your	15
worship	15
think	15
now,	15
that	15
it	15
is	15
an	15
easy	15
thing	15
to	15
write	15
a	15
book?	15
And	15
if	15
this	15
story	15
does	15
not	15
suit	15
him,	15
you	15
may,	15
dear	15
reader,	15
tell	15
him	15
this	15
one,	15
which	15
is	15
likewise	15
of	15
a	15
madman	15
and	15
a	15
dog.	15
In	15
Cordova	15
there	15
was	15
another	15
madman,	15
whose	15
way	15
it	15
was	15
to	15
carry	15
a	15
piece	15
of	15
marble	15
slab	15
or	15
a	15
stone,	15
not	15
of	15
the	15
lightest,	15
on	15
his	15
head,	15
and	15
when	15
he	15
came	15
upon	15
any	15
unwary	15
dog	15
he	15
used	15
to	15
draw	15
close	15
to	15
him	15
and	15
let	15
the	15
weight	15
fall	15
right	15
on	15
top	15
of	15
him;	15
on	15
which	15
the	15
dog	15
in	15
a	15
rage,	15
barking	15
and	15
howling,	15
would	15
run	15
three	15
streets	15
without	15
stopping.	15
It	15
so	15
happened,	15
however,	15
that	15
one	15
of	15
the	15
dogs	15
he	15
discharged	15
his	15
load	15
upon	15
was	15
a	15
cap-maker’s	15
dog,	15
of	15
which	15
his	15
master	15
was	15
very	15
fond.	15
The	15
stone	15
came	15
down	15
hitting	15
it	15
on	15
the	15
head,	15
the	15
dog	15
raised	15
a	15
yell	15
at	15
the	15
blow,	15
the	15
master	15
saw	15
the	15
affair	15
and	15
was	15
wroth,	15
and	15
snatching	15
up	15
a	15
measuring-yard	15
rushed	15
out	15
at	15
the	15
madman	15
and	15
did	15
not	15
leave	15
a	15
sound	15
bone	15
in	15
his	15
body,	15
and	15
at	15
every	15
stroke	15
he	15
gave	15
him	15
he	15
said,	15
“You	15
dog,	15
you	15
thief!	15
my	15
lurcher!	15
Don’t	15
you	15
see,	15
you	15
brute,	15
that	15
my	15
dog	15
is	15
a	15
lurcher?”	15
and	15
so,	15
repeating	15
the	15
word	15
“lurcher”	15
again	15
and	15
again,	15
he	15
sent	15
the	15
madman	15
away	15
beaten	15
to	15
a	15
jelly.	15
The	15
madman	15
took	15
the	15
lesson	15
to	15
heart,	15
and	15
vanished,	15
and	15
for	15
more	15
than	15
a	15
month	15
never	15
once	15
showed	15
himself	15
in	15
public;	15
but	15
after	15
that	15
he	15
came	15
out	15
again	15
with	15
his	15
old	15
trick	15
and	15
a	15
heavier	15
load	15
than	15
ever.	15
He	15
came	15
up	15
to	15
where	15
there	15
was	15
a	15
dog,	15
and	15
examining	15
it	15
very	15
carefully	15
without	15
venturing	15
to	15
let	15
the	15
stone	15
fall,	15
he	15
said:	15
“This	15
is	15
a	15
lurcher;	15
ware!”	15
In	15
short,	15
all	15
the	15
dogs	15
he	15
came	15
across,	15
be	15
they	15
mastiffs	15
or	15
terriers,	15
he	15
said	15
were	15
lurchers;	15
and	15
he	15
discharged	15
no	15
more	15
stones.	15
Maybe	15
it	15
will	15
be	15
the	15
same	15
with	15
this	15
historian;	15
that	15
he	15
will	15
not	15
venture	15
another	15
time	15
to	15
discharge	15
the	15
weight	15
of	15
his	15
wit	15
in	15
books,	15
which,	15
being	15
bad,	15
are	15
harder	15
than	15
stones.	15
Tell	15
him,	15
too,	15
that	15
I	15
do	15
not	15
care	15
a	15
farthing	15
for	15
the	15
threat	15
he	15
holds	15
out	15
to	15
me	15
of	15
depriving	15
me	15
of	15
my	15
profit	15
by	15
means	15
of	15
his	15
book;	15
for,	15
to	15
borrow	15
from	15
the	15
famous	15
interlude	15
of	15
“The	15
Perendenga,”	15
I	15
say	15
in	15
answer	15
to	15
him,	15
“Long	15
life	15
to	15
my	15
lord	15
the	15
Veintiquatro,	15
and	15
Christ	15
be	15
with	15
us	15
all.”	15
Long	15
life	15
to	15
the	15
great	15
Conde	15
de	15
Lemos,	15
whose	15
Christian	15
charity	15
and	15
well-known	15
generosity	15
support	15
me	15
against	15
all	15
the	15
strokes	15
of	15
my	15
curst	15
fortune;	15
and	15
long	15
life	15
to	15
the	15
supreme	15
benevolence	15
of	15
His	15
Eminence	15
of	15
Toledo,	15
Don	15
Bernardo	15
de	15
Sandoval	15
y	15
Rojas;	15
and	15
what	15
matter	15
if	15
there	15
be	15
no	15
printing-presses	15
in	15
the	15
world,	15
or	15
if	15
they	15
print	15
more	15
books	15
against	15
me	15
than	15
there	15
are	15
letters	15
in	15
the	15
verses	15
of	15
Mingo	15
Revulgo!	15
These	15
two	15
princes,	15
unsought	15
by	15
any	15
adulation	15
or	15
flattery	15
of	15
mine,	15
of	15
their	15
own	15
goodness	15
alone,	15
have	15
taken	15
it	15
upon	15
them	15
to	15
show	15
me	15
kindness	15
and	15
protect	15
me,	15
and	15
in	15
this	15
I	15
consider	15
myself	15
happier	15
and	15
richer	15
than	15
if	15
Fortune	15
had	15
raised	15
me	15
to	15
her	15
greatest	15
height	15
in	15
the	15
ordinary	15
way.	15
The	15
poor	15
man	15
may	15
retain	15
honour,	15
but	15
not	15
the	15
vicious;	15
poverty	15
may	15
cast	15
a	15
cloud	15
over	15
nobility,	15
but	15
cannot	15
hide	15
it	15
altogether;	15
and	15
as	15
virtue	15
of	15
itself	15
sheds	15
a	15
certain	15
light,	15
even	15
though	15
it	15
be	15
through	15
the	15
straits	15
and	15
chinks	15
of	15
penury,	15
it	15
wins	15
the	15
esteem	15
of	15
lofty	15
and	15
noble	15
spirits,	15
and	15
in	15
consequence	15
their	15
protection.	15
Thou	15
needst	15
say	15
no	15
more	15
to	15
him,	15
nor	15
will	15
I	15
say	15
anything	15
more	15
to	15
thee,	15
save	15
to	15
tell	15
thee	15
to	15
bear	15
in	15
mind	15
that	15
this	15
Second	15
Part	15
of	15
“Don	15
Quixote”	15
which	15
I	15
offer	15
thee	15
is	15
cut	15
by	15
the	15
same	15
craftsman	15
and	15
from	15
the	15
same	15
cloth	15
as	15
the	15
First,	15
and	15
that	15
in	15
it	15
I	15
present	15
thee	15
Don	15
Quixote	15
continued,	15
and	15
at	15
length	15
dead	15
and	15
buried,	15
so	15
that	15
no	15
one	15
may	15
dare	15
to	15
bring	15
forward	15
any	15
further	15
evidence	15
against	15
him,	15
for	15
that	15
already	15
produced	15
is	15
sufficient;	15
and	15
suffice	15
it,	15
too,	15
that	15
some	15
reputable	15
person	15
should	15
have	15
given	15
an	15
account	15
of	15
all	15
these	15
shrewd	15
lunacies	15
of	15
his	15
without	15
going	15
into	15
the	15
matter	15
again;	15
for	15
abundance,	15
even	15
of	15
good	15
things,	15
prevents	15
them	15
from	15
being	15
valued;	15
and	15
scarcity,	15
even	15
in	15
the	15
case	15
of	15
what	15
is	15
bad,	15
confers	15
a	15
certain	15
value.	15
I	15
was	15
forgetting	15
to	15
tell	15
thee	15
that	15
thou	15
mayest	15
expect	15
the	15
“Persiles,”	15
which	15
I	15
am	15
now	15
finishing,	15
and	15
also	15
the	15
Second	15
Part	15

“Galatea.”	15

Part	15

this	15

and	15
third	15
sally	15
of	15
Don	15
Quixote,	15
says	15
that	15
the	15
curate	15
and	15
the	15
barber	15
remained	15
nearly	15
a	15
month	15
without	15
seeing	15
him,	15
lest	15
they	15
should	15
recall	15
or	15
bring	15
back	15
to	15
his	15
recollection	15
what	15
had	15
taken	15
place.	15
They	15
did	15
not,	15
however,	15
omit	15
to	15
visit	15
his	15
niece	15
and	15
housekeeper,	15
and	15
charge	15
them	15
to	15
be	15
careful	15
to	15
treat	15
him	15
with	15
attention,	15
and	15
give	15
him	15
comforting	15
things	15
to	15
eat,	15
and	15
such	15
as	15
were	15
good	15
for	15
the	15
heart	15
and	15
the	15
brain,	15
whence,	15
it	15
was	15
plain	15
to	15
see,	15
all	15
his	15
misfortune	15
proceeded.	15
The	15
niece	15
and	15
housekeeper	15
replied	15
that	15
they	15
did	15
so,	15
and	15
meant	15
to	15
do	15
so	15
with	15
all	15
possible	15
care	15
and	15
assiduity,	15
for	15
they	15
could	15
perceive	15
that	15
their	15
master	15
was	15
now	15
and	15
then	15
beginning	15
to	15
show	15
signs	15
of	15
being	15
in	15
his	15
right	15
mind.	15
This	15
gave	15
great	15
satisfaction	15
to	15
the	15
curate	15
and	15
the	15
barber,	15
for	15
they	15
concluded	15
they	15
had	15
taken	15
the	15
right	15
course	15
in	15
carrying	15
him	15
off	15
enchanted	15
on	15
the	15
ox-cart,	15
as	15
has	15
been	15
described	15
in	15
the	15
First	15
Part	15
of	15
this	15
great	15
as	15
well	15
as	15
accurate	15
history,	15
in	15
the	15
last	15
chapter	15
thereof.	15
So	15
they	15
resolved	15
to	15
pay	15
him	15
a	15
visit	15
and	15
test	15
the	15
improvement	15
in	15
his	15
condition,	15
although	15
they	15
thought	15
it	15
almost	15
impossible	15
that	15
there	15
could	15
be	15
any;	15
and	15
they	15
agreed	15
not	15
to	15
touch	15
upon	15
any	15
point	15
connected	15
with	15
knight-errantry	15
so	15
as	15
not	15
to	15
run	15
the	15
risk	15
of	15
reopening	15
wounds	15
which	15
were	15
still	15
so	15
tender.	15
They	15
came	15
to	15
see	15
him	15
consequently,	15
and	15
found	15
him	15
sitting	15
up	15
in	15
bed	15
in	15
a	15
green	15
baize	15
waistcoat	15
and	15
a	15
red	15
Toledo	15
cap,	15
and	15
so	15
withered	15
and	15
dried	15
up	15
that	15
he	15
looked	15
as	15
if	15
he	15
had	15
been	15
turned	15
into	15
a	15
mummy.	15
They	15
were	15
very	15
cordially	15
received	15
by	15
him;	15
they	15
asked	15
him	15
after	15
his	15
health,	15
and	15
he	15
talked	15
to	15
them	15
about	15
himself	15
very	15
naturally	15
and	15
in	15
very	15
well-chosen	15
language.	15
In	15
the	15
course	15
of	15
their	15
conversation	15
they	15
fell	15
to	15
discussing	15
what	15
they	15
call	15
State-craft	15
and	15
systems	15
of	15
government,	15
correcting	15
this	15
abuse	15
and	15
condemning	15
that,	15
reforming	15
one	15
practice	15
and	15
abolishing	15
another,	15
each	15
of	15
the	15
three	15
setting	15
up	15
for	15
a	15
new	15
legislator,	15
a	15
modern	15
Lycurgus,	15
or	15
a	15
brand-new	15
Solon;	15
and	15
so	15
completely	15
did	15
they	15
remodel	15
the	15
State,	15
that	15
they	15
seemed	15
to	15
have	15
thrust	15
it	15
into	15
a	15
furnace	15
and	15
taken	15
out	15
something	15
quite	15
different	15
from	15
what	15
they	15
had	15
put	15
in;	15
and	15
on	15
all	15
the	15
subjects	15
they	15
dealt	15
with,	15
Don	15
Quixote	15
spoke	15
with	15
such	15
good	15
sense	15
that	15
the	15
pair	15
of	15
examiners	15
were	15
fully	15
convinced	15
that	15
he	15
was	15
quite	15
recovered	15
and	15
in	15
his	15
full	15
senses.	15
The	15
niece	15
and	15
housekeeper	15
were	15
present	15
at	15
the	15
conversation	15
and	15
could	15
not	15
find	15
words	15
enough	15
to	15
express	15
their	15
thanks	15
to	15
God	15
at	15
seeing	15
their	15
master	15
so	15
clear	15
in	15
his	15
mind;	15
the	15
curate,	15
however,	15
changing	15
his	15
original	15
plan,	15
which	15
was	15
to	15
avoid	15
touching	15
upon	15
matters	15
of	15
chivalry,	15
resolved	15
to	15
test	15
Don	15
Quixote’s	15
recovery	15
thoroughly,	15
and	15
see	15
whether	15
it	15
were	15
genuine	15
or	15
not;	15
and	15
so,	15
from	15
one	15
subject	15
to	15
another,	15
he	15
came	15
at	15
last	15
to	15
talk	15
of	15
the	15
news	15
that	15
had	15
come	15
from	15
the	15
capital,	15
and,	15
among	15
other	15
things,	15
he	15
said	15
it	15
was	15
considered	15
certain	15
that	15
the	15
Turk	15
was	15
coming	15
down	15
with	15
a	15
powerful	15
fleet,	15
and	15
that	15
no	15
one	15
knew	15
what	15
his	15
purpose	15
was,	15
or	15
when	15
the	15
great	15
storm	15
would	15
burst;	15
and	15
that	15
all	15
Christendom	15
was	15
in	15
apprehension	15
of	15
this,	15
which	15
almost	15
every	15
year	15
calls	15
us	15
to	15
arms,	15
and	15
that	15
his	15
Majesty	15
had	15
made	15
provision	15
for	15
the	15
security	15
of	15
the	15
coasts	15
of	15
Naples	15
and	15
Sicily	15
and	15
the	15
island	15
of	15
Malta.	15
To	15
this	15
Don	15
Quixote	15
replied,	15
“His	15
Majesty	15
has	15
acted	15
like	15
a	15
prudent	15
warrior	15
in	15
providing	15
for	15
the	15
safety	15
of	15
his	15
realms	15
in	15
time,	15
so	15
that	15
the	15
enemy	15
may	15
not	15
find	15
him	15
unprepared;	15
but	15
if	15
my	15
advice	15
were	15
taken	15
I	15
would	15
recommend	15
him	15
to	15
adopt	15
a	15
measure	15
which	15
at	15
present,	15
no	15
doubt,	15
his	15
Majesty	15
is	15
very	15
far	15
from	15
thinking	15
of.”	15
The	15
moment	15
the	15
curate	15
heard	15
this	15
he	15
said	15
to	15
himself,	15
“God	15
keep	15
thee	15
in	15
his	15
hand,	15
poor	15
Don	15
Quixote,	15
for	15
it	15
seems	15
to	15
me	15
thou	15
art	15
precipitating	15
thyself	15
from	15
the	15
height	15
of	15
thy	15
madness	15
into	15
the	15
profound	15
abyss	15
of	15
thy	15
simplicity.”	15
But	15
the	15
barber,	15
who	15
had	15
the	15
same	15
suspicion	15
as	15
the	15
curate,	15
asked	15
Don	15
Quixote	15
what	15
would	15
be	15
his	15
advice	15
as	15
to	15
the	15
measures	15
that	15
he	15
said	15
ought	15
to	15
be	15
adopted;	15
for	15
perhaps	15
it	15
might	15
prove	15
to	15
be	15
one	15
that	15
would	15
have	15
to	15
be	15
added	15
to	15
the	15
list	15
of	15
the	15
many	15
impertinent	15
suggestions	15
that	15
people	15
were	15
in	15
the	15
habit	15
of	15
offering	15
to	15
princes.	15
“Mine,	15
master	15
shaver,”	15
said	15
Don	15
Quixote,	15
“will	15
not	15
be	15
impertinent,	15
but,	15
on	15
the	15
contrary,	15
pertinent.”	15
“I	15
don’t	15
mean	15
that,”	15
said	15
the	15
barber,	15
“but	15
that	15
experience	15
has	15
shown	15
that	15
all	15
or	15
most	15
of	15
the	15
expedients	15
which	15
are	15
proposed	15
to	15
his	15
Majesty	15
are	15
either	15
impossible,	15
or	15
absurd,	15
or	15
injurious	15
to	15
the	15
King	15
and	15
to	15
the	15
kingdom.”	15
“Mine,	15
however,”	15
replied	15
Don	15
Quixote,	15
“is	15
neither	15
impossible	15
nor	15
absurd,	15
but	15
the	15
easiest,	15
the	15
most	15
reasonable,	15
the	15
readiest	15
and	15
most	15
expeditious	15
that	15
could	15
suggest	15
itself	15
to	15
any	15
projector’s	15
mind.”	15
“You	15
take	15
a	15
long	15
time	15
to	15
tell	15
it,	15
Señor	15
Don	15
Quixote,”	15
said	15
the	15
curate.	15
“I	15
don’t	15
choose	15
to	15
tell	15
it	15
here,	15
now,”	15
said	15
Don	15
Quixote,	15
“and	15
have	15
it	15
reach	15
the	15
ears	15
of	15
the	15
lords	15
of	15
the	15
council	15
to-morrow	15
morning,	15
and	15
some	15
other	15
carry	15
off	15
the	15
thanks	15
and	15
rewards	15
of	15
my	15
trouble.”	15
“For	15
my	15
part,”	15
said	15
the	15
barber,	15
“I	15
give	15
my	15
word	15
here	15
and	15
before	15
God	15
that	15
I	15
will	15
not	15
repeat	15
what	15
your	15
worship	15
says,	15
to	15
King,	15
Rook	15
or	15
earthly	15
man—an	15
oath	15
I	15
learned	15
from	15
the	15
ballad	15
of	15
the	15
curate,	15
who,	15
in	15
the	15
prelude,	15
told	15
the	15
king	15
of	15
the	15
thief	15
who	15
had	15
robbed	15
him	15
of	15
the	15
hundred	15
gold	15
crowns	15
and	15
his	15
pacing	15
mule.”	15
“I	15
am	15
not	15
versed	15
in	15
stories,”	15
said	15
Don	15
Quixote;	15
“but	15
I	15
know	15
the	15
oath	15
is	15
a	15
good	15
one,	15
because	15
I	15
know	15
the	15
barber	15
to	15
be	15
an	15
honest	15
fellow.”	15
“Even	15
if	15
he	15
were	15
not,”	15
said	15
the	15
curate,	15
“I	15
will	15
go	15
bail	15
and	15
answer	15
for	15
him	15
that	15
in	15
this	15
matter	15
he	15
will	15
be	15
as	15
silent	15
as	15
a	15
dummy,	15
under	15
pain	15
of	15
paying	15
any	15
penalty	15
that	15
may	15
be	15
pronounced.”	15
“And	15
who	15
will	15
be	15
security	15
for	15
you,	15
señor	15
curate?”	15
said	15
Don	15
Quixote.	15
“My	15
profession,”	15
replied	15
the	15
curate,	15
“which	15
is	15
to	15
keep	15
secrets.”	15
“Ods	15
body!”	15
said	15
Don	15
Quixote	15
at	15
this,	15
“what	15
more	15
has	15
his	15
Majesty	15
to	15
do	15
but	15
to	15
command,	15
by	15
public	15
proclamation,	15
all	15
the	15
knights-errant	15
that	15
are	15
scattered	15
over	15
Spain	15
to	15
assemble	15
on	15
a	15
fixed	15
day	15
in	15
the	15
capital,	15
for	15
even	15
if	15
no	15
more	15
than	15
half	15
a	15
dozen	15
come,	15
there	15
may	15
be	15
one	15
among	15
them	15
who	15
alone	15
will	15
suffice	15
to	15
destroy	15
the	15
entire	15
might	15
of	15
the	15
Turk.	15
Give	15
me	15
your	15
attention	15
and	15
follow	15
me.	15
Is	15
it,	15
pray,	15
any	15
new	15
thing	15
for	15
a	15
single	15
knight-errant	15
to	15
demolish	15
an	15
army	15
of	15
two	15
hundred	15
thousand	15
men,	15
as	15
if	15
they	15
all	15
had	15
but	15
one	15
throat	15
or	15
were	15
made	15
of	15
sugar	15
paste?	15
Nay,	15
tell	15
me,	15
how	15
many	15
histories	15
are	15
there	15
filled	15
with	15
these	15
marvels?	15
If	15
only	15
(in	15
an	15
evil	15
hour	15
for	15
me:	15
I	15
don’t	15
speak	15
for	15
anyone	15
else)	15
the	15
famous	15
Don	15
Belianis	15
were	15
alive	15
now,	15
or	15
anyone	15
of	15
the	15
innumerable	15
progeny	15
of	15
Amadis	15
of	15
Gaul!	15
If	15
any	15
these	15
were	15
alive	15
to-day,	15
and	15
were	15
to	15
come	15
face	15
to	15
face	15
with	15
the	15
Turk,	15
by	15
my	15
faith,	15
I	15
would	15
not	15
give	15
much	15
for	15
the	15
Turk’s	15
chance.	15
But	15
God	15
will	15
have	15
regard	15
for	15
his	15
people,	15
and	15
will	15
provide	15
someone,	15
who,	15
if	15
not	15
so	15
valiant	15
as	15
the	15
knights-errant	15
of	15
yore,	15
at	15
least	15
will	15
not	15
be	15
inferior	15
to	15
them	15
in	15
spirit;	15
but	15
God	15
knows	15
what	15
I	15
mean,	15
and	15
I	15
say	15
no	15
more.”	15
“Alas!”	15
exclaimed	15
the	15
niece	15
at	15
this,	15
“may	15
I	15
die	15
if	15
my	15
master	15
does	15
not	15
want	15
to	15
turn	15
knight-errant	15
again;”	15
to	15
which	15
Don	15
Quixote	15
replied,	15
“A	15
knight-errant	15
I	15
shall	15
die,	15
and	15
let	15
the	15
Turk	15
come	15
down	15
or	15
go	15
up	15
when	15
he	15
likes,	15
and	15
in	15
as	15
strong	15
force	15
as	15
he	15
can,	15
once	15
more	15
I	15
say,	15
God	15
knows	15
what	15
I	15
mean.”	15
But	15
here	15
the	15
barber	15
said,	15
“I	15
ask	15
your	15
worships	15
to	15
give	15
me	15
leave	15
to	15
tell	15
a	15
short	15
story	15
of	15
something	15
that	15
happened	15
in	15
Seville,	15
which	15
comes	15
so	15
pat	15
to	15
the	15
purpose	15
just	15
now	15
that	15
I	15
should	15
like	15
greatly	15
to	15
tell	15
it.”	15
Don	15
Quixote	15
gave	15
him	15
leave,	15
and	15
the	15
rest	15
prepared	15
to	15
listen,	15
and	15
he	15
began	15
thus:	15
“In	15
the	15
madhouse	15
at	15
Seville	15
there	15
was	15
a	15
man	15
whom	15
his	15
relations	15
had	15
placed	15
there	15
as	15
being	15
out	15
of	15
his	15
mind.	15
He	15
was	15
a	15
graduate	15
of	15
Osuna	15
in	15
canon	15
law;	15
but	15
even	15
if	15
he	15
had	15
been	15
of	15
Salamanca,	15
it	15
was	15
the	15
opinion	15
of	15
most	15
people	15
that	15
he	15
would	15
have	15
been	15
mad	15
all	15
the	15
same.	15
This	15
graduate,	15
after	15
some	15
years	15
of	15
confinement,	15
took	15
it	15
into	15
his	15
head	15
that	15
he	15
was	15
sane	15
and	15
in	15
his	15
full	15
senses,	15
and	15
under	15
this	15
impression	15
wrote	15
to	15
the	15
Archbishop,	15
entreating	15
him	15
earnestly,	15
and	15
in	15
very	15
correct	15
language,	15
to	15
have	15
him	15
released	15
from	15
the	15
misery	15
in	15
which	15
he	15
was	15
living;	15
for	15
by	15
God’s	15
mercy	15
he	15
had	15
now	15
recovered	15
his	15
lost	15
reason,	15
though	15
his	15
relations,	15
in	15
order	15
to	15
enjoy	15
his	15
property,	15
kept	15
him	15
there,	15
and,	15
in	15
spite	15
of	15
the	15
truth,	15
would	15
make	15
him	15
out	15
to	15
be	15
mad	15
until	15
his	15
dying	15
day.	15
The	15
Archbishop,	15
moved	15
by	15
repeated	15
sensible,	15
well-written	15
letters,	15
directed	15
one	15
of	15
his	15
chaplains	15
to	15
make	15
inquiry	15
of	15
the	15
madhouse	15
as	15
to	15
the	15
truth	15
of	15
the	15
licentiate’s	15
statements,	15
and	15
to	15
have	15
an	15
interview	15
with	15
the	15
madman	15
himself,	15
and,	15
if	15
it	15
should	15
appear	15
that	15
he	15
was	15
in	15
his	15
senses,	15
to	15
take	15
him	15
out	15
and	15
restore	15
him	15
to	15
liberty.	15
The	15
chaplain	15
did	15
so,	15
and	15
the	15
governor	15
assured	15
him	15
that	15
the	15
man	15
was	15
still	15
mad,	15
and	15
that	15
though	15
he	15
often	15
spoke	15
like	15
a	15
highly	15
intelligent	15
person,	15
he	15
would	15
in	15
the	15
end	15
break	15
out	15
into	15
nonsense	15
that	15
in	15
quantity	15
and	15
quality	15
counterbalanced	15
all	15
the	15
sensible	15
things	15
he	15
had	15
said	15
before,	15
as	15
might	15
be	15
easily	15
tested	15
by	15
talking	15
to	15
him.	15
The	15
chaplain	15
resolved	15
to	15
try	15
the	15
experiment,	15
and	15
obtaining	15
access	15
to	15
the	15
madman	15
conversed	15
with	15
him	15
for	15
an	15
hour	15
or	15
more,	15
during	15
the	15
whole	15
of	15
which	15
time	15
he	15
never	15
uttered	15
a	15
word	15
that	15
was	15
incoherent	15
or	15
absurd,	15
but,	15
on	15
the	15
contrary,	15
spoke	15
so	15
rationally	15
that	15
the	15
chaplain	15
was	15
compelled	15
to	15
believe	15
him	15
to	15
be	15
sane.	15
Among	15
other	15
things,	15
he	15
said	15
the	15
governor	15
was	15
against	15
him,	15
not	15
to	15
lose	15
the	15
presents	15
his	15
relations	15
made	15
him	15
for	15
reporting	15
him	15
still	15
mad	15
but	15
with	15
lucid	15
intervals;	15
and	15
that	15
the	15
worst	15
foe	15
he	15
had	15
in	15
his	15
misfortune	15
was	15
his	15
large	15
property;	15
for	15
in	15
order	15
to	15
enjoy	15
it	15
his	15
enemies	15
disparaged	15
and	15
threw	15
doubts	15
upon	15
the	15
mercy	15
our	15
Lord	15
had	15
shown	15
him	15
in	15
turning	15
him	15
from	15
a	15
brute	15
beast	15
into	15
a	15
man.	15
In	15
short,	15
he	15
spoke	15
in	15
such	15
a	15
way	15
that	15
he	15
cast	15
suspicion	15
on	15
the	15
governor,	15
and	15
made	15
his	15
relations	15
appear	15
covetous	15
and	15
heartless,	15
and	15
himself	15
so	15
rational	15
that	15
the	15
chaplain	15
determined	15
to	15
take	15
him	15
away	15
with	15
him	15
that	15
the	15
Archbishop	15
might	15
see	15
him,	15
and	15
ascertain	15
for	15
himself	15
the	15
truth	15
of	15
the	15
matter.	15
Yielding	15
to	15
this	15
conviction,	15
the	15
worthy	15
chaplain	15
begged	15
the	15
governor	15
to	15
have	15
the	15
clothes	15
in	15
which	15
the	15
licentiate	15
had	15
entered	15
the	15
house	15
given	15
to	15
him.	15
The	15
governor	15
again	15
bade	15
him	15
beware	15
of	15
what	15
he	15
was	15
doing,	15
as	15
the	15
licentiate	15
was	15
beyond	15
a	15
doubt	15
still	15
mad;	15
but	15
all	15
his	15
cautions	15
and	15
warnings	15
were	15
unavailing	15
to	15
dissuade	15
the	15
chaplain	15
from	15
taking	15
him	15
away.	15
The	15
governor,	15
seeing	15
that	15
it	15
was	15
the	15
order	15
of	15
the	15
Archbishop,	15
obeyed,	15
and	15
they	15
dressed	15
the	15
licentiate	15
in	15
his	15
own	15
clothes,	15
which	15
were	15
new	15
and	15
decent.	15
He,	15
as	15
soon	15
as	15
he	15
saw	15
himself	15
clothed	15
like	15
one	15
in	15
his	15
senses,	15
and	15
divested	15
of	15
the	15
appearance	15
of	15
a	15
madman,	15
entreated	15
the	15
chaplain	15
to	15
permit	15
him	15
in	15
charity	15
to	15
go	15
and	15
take	15
leave	15
of	15
his	15
comrades	15
the	15
madmen.	15
The	15
chaplain	15
said	15
he	15
would	15
go	15
with	15
him	15
to	15
see	15
what	15
madmen	15
there	15
were	15
in	15
the	15
house;	15
so	15
they	15
went	15
upstairs,	15
and	15
with	15
them	15
some	15
of	15
those	15
who	15
were	15
present.	15
Approaching	15
a	15
cage	15
in	15
which	15
there	15
was	15
a	15
furious	15
madman,	15
though	15
just	15
at	15
that	15
moment	15
calm	15
and	15
quiet,	15
the	15
licentiate	15
said	15
to	15
him,	15
‘Brother,	15
think	15
if	15
you	15
have	15
any	15
commands	15
for	15
me,	15
for	15
I	15
am	15
going	15
home,	15
as	15
God	15
has	15
been	15
pleased,	15
in	15
his	15
infinite	15
goodness	15
and	15
mercy,	15
without	15
any	15
merit	15
of	15
mine,	15
to	15
restore	15
me	15
my	15
reason.	15
I	15
am	15
now	15
cured	15
and	15
in	15
my	15
senses,	15
for	15
with	15
God’s	15
power	15
nothing	15
is	15
impossible.	15
Have	15
strong	15
hope	15
and	15
trust	15
in	15
him,	15
for	15
as	15
he	15
has	15
restored	15
me	15
to	15
my	15
original	15
condition,	15
so	15
likewise	15
he	15
will	15
restore	15
you	15
if	15
you	15
trust	15
in	15
him.	15
I	15
will	15
take	15
care	15
to	15
send	15
you	15
some	15
good	15
things	15
to	15
eat;	15
and	15
be	15
sure	15
you	15
eat	15
them;	15
for	15
I	15
would	15
have	15
you	15
know	15
I	15
am	15
convinced,	15
as	15
one	15
who	15
has	15
gone	15
through	15
it,	15
that	15
all	15
this	15
madness	15
of	15
ours	15
comes	15
of	15
having	15
the	15
stomach	15
empty	15
and	15
the	15
brains	15
full	15
of	15
wind.	15
Take	15
courage!	15
take	15
courage!	15
for	15
despondency	15
in	15
misfortune	15
breaks	15
down	15
health	15
and	15
brings	15
on	15
death.’	15
“To	15
all	15
these	15
words	15
of	15
the	15
licentiate	15
another	15
madman	15
in	15
a	15
cage	15
opposite	15
that	15
of	15
the	15
furious	15
one	15
was	15
listening;	15
and	15
raising	15
himself	15
up	15
from	15
an	15
old	15
mat	15
on	15
which	15
he	15
lay	15
stark	15
naked,	15
he	15
asked	15
in	15
a	15
loud	15
voice	15
who	15
it	15
was	15
that	15
was	15
going	15
away	15
cured	15
and	15
in	15
his	15
senses.	15
The	15
licentiate	15
answered,	15
‘It	15
is	15
I,	15
brother,	15
who	15
am	15
going;	15
I	15
have	15
now	15
no	15
need	15
to	15
remain	15
here	15
any	15
longer,	15
for	15
which	15
I	15
return	15
infinite	15
thanks	15
to	15
Heaven	15
that	15
has	15
had	15
so	15
great	15
mercy	15
upon	15
me.’	15
“‘Mind	15
what	15
you	15
are	15
saying,	15
licentiate;	15
don’t	15
let	15
the	15
devil	15
deceive	15
you,’	15
replied	15
the	15
madman.	15
‘Keep	15
quiet,	15
stay	15
where	15
you	15
are,	15
and	15
you	15
will	15
save	15
yourself	15
the	15
trouble	15
of	15
coming	15
back.’	15
“‘I	15
know	15
I	15
am	15
cured,’	15
returned	15
the	15
licentiate,	15
‘and	15
that	15
I	15
shall	15
not	15
have	15
to	15
go	15
stations	15
again.’	15
“‘You	15
cured!’	15
said	15
the	15
madman;	15
‘well,	15
we	15
shall	15
see;	15
God	15
be	15
with	15
you;	15
but	15
I	15
swear	15
to	15
you	15
by	15
Jupiter,	15
whose	15
majesty	15
I	15
represent	15
on	15
earth,	15
that	15
for	15
this	15
crime	15
alone,	15
which	15
Seville	15
is	15
committing	15
to-day	15
in	15
releasing	15
you	15
from	15
this	15
house,	15
and	15
treating	15
you	15
as	15
if	15
you	15
were	15
in	15
your	15
senses,	15
I	15
shall	15
have	15
to	15
inflict	15
such	15
a	15
punishment	15
on	15
it	15
as	15
will	15
be	15
remembered	15
for	15
ages	15
and	15
ages,	15
amen.	15
Dost	15
thou	15
not	15
know,	15
thou	15
miserable	15
little	15
licentiate,	15
that	15
I	15
can	15
do	15
it,	15
being,	15
as	15
I	15
say,	15
Jupiter	15
the	15
Thunderer,	15
who	15
hold	15
in	15
my	15
hands	15
the	15
fiery	15
bolts	15
with	15
which	15
I	15
am	15
able	15
and	15
am	15
wont	15
to	15
threaten	15
and	15
lay	15
waste	15
the	15
world?	15
But	15
in	15
one	15
way	15
only	15
will	15
I	15
punish	15
this	15
ignorant	15
town,	15
and	15
that	15
is	15
by	15
not	15
raining	15
upon	15
it,	15
nor	15
on	15
any	15
part	15
of	15
its	15
district	15
or	15
territory,	15
for	15
three	15
whole	15
years,	15
to	15
be	15
reckoned	15
from	15
the	15
day	15
and	15
moment	15
when	15
this	15
threat	15
is	15
pronounced.	15
Thou	15
free,	15
thou	15
cured,	15
thou	15
in	15
thy	15
senses!	15
and	15
I	15
mad,	15
I	15
disordered,	15
I	15
bound!	15
I	15
will	15
as	15
soon	15
think	15
of	15
sending	15
rain	15
as	15
of	15
hanging	15
myself.	15
“Those	15
present	15
stood	15
listening	15
to	15
the	15
words	15
and	15
exclamations	15
of	15
the	15
madman;	15
but	15
our	15
licentiate,	15
turning	15
to	15
the	15
chaplain	15
and	15
seizing	15
him	15
by	15
the	15
hands,	15
said	15
to	15
him,	15
‘Be	15
not	15
uneasy,	15
señor;	15
attach	15
no	15
importance	15
to	15
what	15
this	15
madman	15
has	15
said;	15
for	15
if	15
he	15
is	15
Jupiter	15
and	15
will	15
not	15
send	15
rain,	15
I,	15
who	15
am	15
Neptune,	15
the	15
father	15
and	15
god	15
of	15
the	15
waters,	15
will	15
rain	15
as	15
often	15
as	15
it	15
pleases	15
me	15
and	15
may	15
be	15
needful.’	15
“The	15
governor	15
and	15
the	15
bystanders	15
laughed,	15
and	15
at	15
their	15
laughter	15
the	15
chaplain	15
was	15
half	15
ashamed,	15
and	15
he	15
replied,	15
‘For	15
all	15
that,	15
Señor	15
Neptune,	15
it	15
will	15
not	15
do	15
to	15
vex	15
Señor	15
Jupiter;	15
remain	15
where	15
you	15
are,	15
and	15
some	15
other	15
day,	15
when	15
there	15
is	15
a	15
better	15
opportunity	15
and	15
more	15
time,	15
we	15
will	15
come	15
back	15
for	15
you.’	15
So	15
they	15
stripped	15
the	15
licentiate,	15
and	15
he	15
was	15
left	15
where	15
he	15
was;	15
and	15
that’s	15
the	15
end	15
of	15
the	15
story.”	15
“So	15
that’s	15
the	15
story,	15
master	15
barber,”	15
said	15
Don	15
Quixote,	15
“which	15
came	15
in	15
so	15
pat	15
to	15
the	15
purpose	15
that	15
you	15
could	15
not	15
help	15
telling	15
it?	15
Master	15
shaver,	15
master	15
shaver!	15
how	15
blind	15
is	15
he	15
who	15
cannot	15
see	15
through	15
a	15
sieve.	15
Is	15
it	15
possible	15
that	15
you	15
do	15
not	15
know	15
that	15
comparisons	15
of	15
wit	15
with	15
wit,	15
valour	15
with	15
valour,	15
beauty	15
with	15
beauty,	15
birth	15
with	15
birth,	15
are	15
always	15
odious	15
and	15
unwelcome?	15
I,	15
master	15
barber,	15
am	15
not	15
Neptune,	15
the	15
god	15
of	15
the	15
waters,	15
nor	15
do	15
I	15
try	15
to	15
make	15
anyone	15
take	15
me	15
for	15
an	15
astute	15
man,	15
for	15
I	15
am	15
not	15
one.	15
My	15
only	15
endeavour	15
is	15
to	15
convince	15
the	15
world	15
of	15
the	15
mistake	15
it	15
makes	15
in	15
not	15
reviving	15
in	15
itself	15
the	15
happy	15
time	15
when	15
the	15
order	15
of	15
knight-errantry	15
was	15
in	15
the	15
field.	15
But	15
our	15
depraved	15
age	15
does	15
not	15
deserve	15
to	15
enjoy	15
such	15
a	15
blessing	15
as	15
those	15
ages	15
enjoyed	15
when	15
knights-errant	15
took	15
upon	15
their	15
shoulders	15
the	15
defence	15
of	15
kingdoms,	15
the	15
protection	15
of	15
damsels,	15
the	15
succour	15
of	15
orphans	15
and	15
minors,	15
the	15
chastisement	15
of	15
the	15
proud,	15
and	15
the	15
recompense	15
of	15
the	15
humble.	15
With	15
the	15
knights	15
of	15
these	15
days,	15
for	15
the	15
most	15
part,	15
it	15
is	15
the	15
damask,	15
brocade,	15
and	15
rich	15
stuffs	15
they	15
wear,	15
that	15
rustle	15
as	15
they	15
go,	15
not	15
the	15
chain	15
mail	15
of	15
their	15
armour;	15
no	15
knight	15
now-a-days	15
sleeps	15
in	15
the	15
open	15
field	15
exposed	15
to	15
the	15
inclemency	15
of	15
heaven,	15
and	15
in	15
full	15
panoply	15
from	15
head	15
to	15
foot;	15
no	15
one	15
now	15
takes	15
a	15
nap,	15
as	15
they	15
call	15
it,	15
without	15
drawing	15
his	15
feet	15
out	15
of	15
the	15
stirrups,	15
and	15
leaning	15
upon	15
his	15
lance,	15
as	15
the	15
knights-errant	15
used	15
to	15
do;	15
no	15
one	15
now,	15
issuing	15
from	15
the	15
wood,	15
penetrates	15
yonder	15
mountains,	15
and	15
then	15
treads	15
the	15
barren,	15
lonely	15
shore	15
of	15
the	15
sea—mostly	15
a	15
tempestuous	15
and	15
stormy	15
one—and	15
finding	15
on	15
the	15
beach	15
a	15
little	15
bark	15
without	15
oars,	15
sail,	15
mast,	15
or	15
tackling	15
of	15
any	15
kind,	15
in	15
the	15
intrepidity	15
of	15
his	15
heart	15
flings	15
himself	15
into	15
it	15
and	15
commits	15
himself	15
to	15
the	15
wrathful	15
billows	15
of	15
the	15
deep	15
sea,	15
that	15
one	15
moment	15
lift	15
him	15
up	15
to	15
heaven	15
and	15
the	15
next	15
plunge	15
him	15
into	15
the	15
depths;	15
and	15
opposing	15
his	15
breast	15
to	15
the	15
irresistible	15
gale,	15
finds	15
himself,	15
when	15
he	15
least	15
expects	15
it,	15
three	15
thousand	15
leagues	15
and	15
more	15
away	15
from	15
the	15
place	15
where	15
he	15
embarked;	15
and	15
leaping	15
ashore	15
in	15
a	15
remote	15
and	15
unknown	15
land	15
has	15
adventures	15
that	15
deserve	15
to	15
be	15
written,	15
not	15
on	15
parchment,	15
but	15
on	15
brass.	15
But	15
now	15
sloth	15
triumphs	15
over	15
energy,	15
indolence	15
over	15
exertion,	15
vice	15
over	15
virtue,	15
arrogance	15
over	15
courage,	15
and	15
theory	15
over	15
practice	15
in	15
arms,	15
which	15
flourished	15
and	15
shone	15
only	15
in	15
the	15
golden	15
ages	15
and	15
in	15
knights-errant.	15
For	15
tell	15
me,	15
who	15
was	15
more	15
virtuous	15
and	15
more	15
valiant	15
than	15
the	15
famous	15
Amadis	15
of	15
Gaul?	15
Who	15
more	15
discreet	15
than	15
Palmerin	15
of	15
England?	15
Who	15
more	15
gracious	15
and	15
easy	15
than	15
Tirante	15
el	15
Blanco?	15
Who	15
more	15
courtly	15
than	15
Lisuarte	15
of	15
Greece?	15
Who	15
more	15
slashed	15
or	15
slashing	15
than	15
Don	15
Belianis?	15
Who	15
more	15
intrepid	15
than	15
Perion	15
of	15
Gaul?	15
Who	15
more	15
ready	15
to	15
face	15
danger	15
than	15
Felixmarte	15
of	15
Hircania?	15
Who	15
more	15
sincere	15
than	15
Esplandian?	15
Who	15
more	15
impetuous	15
than	15
Don	15
Cirongilio	15
of	15
Thrace?	15
Who	15
more	15
bold	15
than	15
Rodamonte?	15
Who	15
more	15
prudent	15
than	15
King	15
Sobrino?	15
Who	15
more	15
daring	15
than	15
Reinaldos?	15
Who	15
more	15
invincible	15
than	15
Roland?	15
and	15
who	15
more	15
gallant	15
and	15
courteous	15
than	15
Ruggiero,	15
from	15
whom	15
the	15
dukes	15
of	15
Ferrara	15
of	15
the	15
present	15
day	15
are	15
descended,	15
according	15
to	15
Turpin	15
in	15
his	15
‘Cosmography.’	15
All	15
these	15
knights,	15
and	15
many	15
more	15
that	15
I	15
could	15
name,	15
señor	15
curate,	15
were	15
knights-errant,	15
the	15
light	15
and	15
glory	15
of	15
chivalry.	15
These,	15
or	15
such	15
as	15
these,	15
I	15
would	15
have	15
to	15
carry	15
out	15
my	15
plan,	15
and	15
in	15
that	15
case	15
his	15
Majesty	15
would	15
find	15
himself	15
well	15
served	15
and	15
would	15
save	15
great	15
expense,	15
and	15
the	15
Turk	15
would	15
be	15
left	15
tearing	15
his	15
beard.	15
And	15
so	15
I	15
will	15
stay	15
where	15
I	15
am,	15
as	15
the	15
chaplain	15
does	15
not	15
take	15
me	15
away;	15
and	15
if	15
Jupiter,	15
as	15
the	15
barber	15
has	15
told	15
us,	15
will	15
not	15
send	15
rain,	15
here	15
am	15
I,	15
and	15
I	15
will	15
rain	15
when	15
I	15
please.	15
I	15
say	15
this	15
that	15
Master	15
Basin	15
may	15
know	15
that	15
I	15
understand	15
him.”	15
“Indeed,	15
Señor	15
Don	15
Quixote,”	15
said	15
the	15
barber,	15
“I	15
did	15
not	15
mean	15
it	15
in	15
that	15
way,	15
and,	15
so	15
help	15
me	15
God,	15
my	15
intention	15
was	15
good,	15
and	15
your	15
worship	15
ought	15
not	15
to	15
be	15
vexed.”	15
“As	15
to	15
whether	15
I	15
ought	15
to	15
be	15
vexed	15
or	15
not,”	15
returned	15
Don	15
Quixote,	15
“I	15
myself	15
am	15
the	15
best	15
judge.”	15
Hereupon	15
the	15
curate	15
observed,	15
“I	15
have	15
hardly	15
said	15
a	15
word	15
as	15
yet;	15
and	15
I	15
would	15
gladly	15
be	15
relieved	15
of	15
a	15
doubt,	15
arising	15
from	15
what	15
Don	15
Quixote	15
has	15
said,	15
that	15
worries	15
and	15
works	15
my	15
conscience.”	15
“The	15
señor	15
curate	15
has	15
leave	15
for	15
more	15
than	15
that,”	15
returned	15
Don	15
Quixote,	15
“so	15
he	15
may	15
declare	15
his	15
doubt,	15
for	15
it	15
is	15
not	15
pleasant	15
to	15
have	15
a	15
doubt	15
on	15
one’s	15
conscience.”	15
“Well	15
then,	15
with	15
that	15
permission,”	15
said	15
the	15
curate,	15
“I	15
say	15
my	15
doubt	15
is	15
that,	15
all	15
I	15
can	15
do,	15
I	15
cannot	15
persuade	15
myself	15
that	15
the	15
whole	15
pack	15
of	15
knights-errant	15
you,	15
Señor	15
Don	15
Quixote,	15
have	15
mentioned,	15
were	15
really	15
and	15
truly	15
persons	15
of	15
flesh	15
and	15
blood,	15
that	15
ever	15
lived	15
in	15
the	15
world;	15
on	15
the	15
contrary,	15
I	15
suspect	15
it	15
to	15
be	15
all	15
fiction,	15
fable,	15
and	15
falsehood,	15
and	15
dreams	15
told	15
by	15
men	15
awakened	15
from	15
sleep,	15
or	15
rather	15
still	15
half	15
asleep.”	15
“That	15
is	15
another	15
mistake,”	15
replied	15
Don	15
Quixote,	15
“into	15
which	15
many	15
have	15
fallen	15
who	15
do	15
not	15
believe	15
that	15
there	15
ever	15
were	15
such	15
knights	15
in	15
the	15
world,	15
and	15
I	15
have	15
often,	15
with	15
divers	15
people	15
and	15
on	15
divers	15
occasions,	15
tried	15
to	15
expose	15
this	15
almost	15
universal	15
error	15
to	15
the	15
light	15
of	15
truth.	15
Sometimes	15
I	15
have	15
not	15
been	15
successful	15
in	15
my	15
purpose,	15
sometimes	15
I	15
have,	15
supporting	15
it	15
upon	15
the	15
shoulders	15
of	15
the	15
truth;	15
which	15
truth	15
is	15
so	15
clear	15
that	15
I	15
can	15
almost	15
say	15
I	15
have	15
with	15
my	15
own	15
eyes	15
seen	15
Amadis	15
of	15
Gaul,	15
who	15
was	15
a	15
man	15
of	15
lofty	15
stature,	15
fair	15
complexion,	15
with	15
a	15
handsome	15
though	15
black	15
beard,	15
of	15
a	15
countenance	15
between	15
gentle	15
and	15
stern	15
in	15
expression,	15
sparing	15
of	15
words,	15
slow	15
to	15
anger,	15
and	15
quick	15
to	15
put	15
it	15
away	15
from	15
him;	15
and	15
as	15
I	15
have	15
depicted	15
Amadis,	15
so	15
I	15
could,	15
I	15
think,	15
portray	15
and	15
describe	15
all	15
the	15
knights-errant	15
that	15
are	15
in	15
all	15
the	15
histories	15
in	15
the	15
world;	15
for	15
by	15
the	15
perception	15
I	15
have	15
that	15
they	15
were	15
what	15
their	15
histories	15
describe,	15
and	15
by	15
the	15
deeds	15
they	15
did	15
and	15
the	15
dispositions	15
they	15
displayed,	15
it	15
is	15
possible,	15
with	15
the	15
aid	15
of	15
sound	15
philosophy,	15
to	15
deduce	15
their	15
features,	15
complexion,	15
and	15
stature.”	15
“How	15
big,	15
in	15
your	15
worship’s	15
opinion,	15
may	15
the	15
giant	15
Morgante	15
have	15
been,	15
Señor	15
Don	15
Quixote?”	15
asked	15
the	15
barber.	15
“With	15
regard	15
to	15
giants,”	15
replied	15
Don	15
Quixote,	15
“opinions	15
differ	15
as	15
to	15
whether	15
there	15
ever	15
were	15
any	15
or	15
not	15
in	15
the	15
world;	15
but	15
the	15
Holy	15
Scripture,	15
which	15
cannot	15
err	15
by	15
a	15
jot	15
from	15
the	15
truth,	15
shows	15
us	15
that	15
there	15
were,	15
when	15
it	15
gives	15
us	15
the	15
history	15
of	15
that	15
big	15
Philistine,	15
Goliath,	15
who	15
was	15
seven	15
cubits	15
and	15
a	15
half	15
in	15
height,	15
which	15
is	15
a	15
huge	15
size.	15
Likewise,	15
in	15
the	15
island	15
of	15
Sicily,	15
there	15
have	15
been	15
found	15
leg-bones	15
and	15
arm-bones	15
so	15
large	15
that	15
their	15
size	15
makes	15
it	15
plain	15
that	15
their	15
owners	15
were	15
giants,	15
and	15
as	15
tall	15
as	15
great	15
towers;	15
geometry	15
puts	15
this	15
fact	15
beyond	15
a	15
doubt.	15
But,	15
for	15
all	15
that,	15
I	15
cannot	15
speak	15
with	15
certainty	15
as	15
to	15
the	15
size	15
of	15
Morgante,	15
though	15
I	15
suspect	15
he	15
cannot	15
have	15
been	15
very	15
tall;	15
and	15
I	15
am	15
inclined	15
to	15
be	15
of	15
this	15
opinion	15
because	15
I	15
find	15
in	15
the	15
history	15
in	15
which	15
his	15
deeds	15
are	15
particularly	15
mentioned,	15
that	15
he	15
frequently	15
slept	15
under	15
a	15
roof	15
and	15
as	15
he	15
found	15
houses	15
to	15
contain	15
him,	15
it	15
is	15
clear	15
that	15
his	15
bulk	15
could	15
not	15
have	15
been	15
anything	15
excessive.”	15
“That	15
is	15
true,”	15
said	15
the	15
curate,	15
and	15
yielding	15
to	15
the	15
enjoyment	15
of	15
hearing	15
such	15
nonsense,	15
he	15
asked	15
him	15
what	15
was	15
his	15
notion	15
of	15
the	15
features	15
of	15
Reinaldos	15
of	15
Montalban,	15
and	15
Don	15
Roland	15
and	15
the	15
rest	15
of	15
the	15
Twelve	15
Peers	15
of	15
France,	15
for	15
they	15
were	15
all	15
knights-errant.	15
“As	15
for	15
Reinaldos,”	15
replied	15
Don	15
Quixote,	15
“I	15
venture	15
to	15
say	15
that	15
he	15
was	15
broad-faced,	15
of	15
ruddy	15
complexion,	15
with	15
roguish	15
and	15
somewhat	15
prominent	15
eyes,	15
excessively	15
punctilious	15
and	15
touchy,	15
and	15
given	15
to	15
the	15
society	15
of	15
thieves	15
and	15
scapegraces.	15
With	15
regard	15
to	15
Roland,	15
or	15
Rotolando,	15
or	15
Orlando	15
(for	15
the	15
histories	15
call	15
him	15
by	15
all	15
these	15
names),	15
I	15
am	15
of	15
opinion,	15
and	15
hold,	15
that	15
he	15
was	15
of	15
middle	15
height,	15
broad-shouldered,	15
rather	15
bow-legged,	15
swarthy-complexioned,	15
red-bearded,	15
with	15
a	15
hairy	15
body	15
and	15
a	15
severe	15
expression	15
of	15
countenance,	15
a	15
man	15
of	15
few	15
words,	15
but	15
very	15
polite	15
and	15
well-bred.”	15
“If	15
Roland	15
was	15
not	15
a	15
more	15
graceful	15
person	15
than	15
your	15
worship	15
has	15
described,”	15
said	15
the	15
curate,	15
“it	15
is	15
no	15
wonder	15
that	15
the	15
fair	15
Lady	15
Angelica	15
rejected	15
him	15
and	15
left	15
him	15
for	15
the	15
gaiety,	15
liveliness,	15
and	15
grace	15
of	15
that	15
budding-bearded	15
little	15
Moor	15
to	15
whom	15
she	15
surrendered	15
herself;	15
and	15
she	15
showed	15
her	15
sense	15
in	15
falling	15
in	15
love	15
with	15
the	15
gentle	15
softness	15
of	15
Medoro	15
rather	15
than	15
the	15
roughness	15
of	15
Roland.”	15
“That	15
Angelica,	15
señor	15
curate,”	15
returned	15
Don	15
Quixote,	15
“was	15
a	15
giddy	15
damsel,	15
flighty	15
and	15
somewhat	15
wanton,	15
and	15
she	15
left	15
the	15
world	15
as	15
full	15
of	15
her	15
vagaries	15
as	15
of	15
the	15
fame	15
of	15
her	15
beauty.	15
She	15
treated	15
with	15
scorn	15
a	15
thousand	15
gentlemen,	15
men	15
of	15
valour	15
and	15
wisdom,	15
and	15
took	15
up	15
with	15
a	15
smooth-faced	15
sprig	15
of	15
a	15
page,	15
without	15
fortune	15
or	15
fame,	15
except	15
such	15
reputation	15
for	15
gratitude	15
as	15
the	15
affection	15
he	15
bore	15
his	15
friend	15
got	15
for	15
him.	15
The	15
great	15
poet	15
who	15
sang	15
her	15
beauty,	15
the	15
famous	15
Ariosto,	15
not	15
caring	15
to	15
sing	15
her	15
adventures	15
after	15
her	15
contemptible	15
surrender	15
(which	15
probably	15
were	15
not	15
over	15
and	15
above	15
creditable),	15
dropped	15
her	15
where	15
he	15
says:	15
How	15
she	15
received	15
the	15
sceptre	15
of	15
Cathay,	15
Some	15
bard	15
of	15
defter	15
quill	15
may	15
sing	15
some	15
day;	15
and	15
this	15
was	15
no	15
doubt	15
a	15
kind	15
of	15
prophecy,	15
for	15
poets	15
are	15
also	15
called	15
_vates_,	15
that	15
is	15
to	15
say	15
diviners;	15
and	15
its	15
truth	15
was	15
made	15
plain;	15
for	15
since	15
then	15
a	15
famous	15
Andalusian	15
poet	15
has	15
lamented	15
and	15
sung	15
her	15
tears,	15
and	15
another	15
famous	15
and	15
rare	15
poet,	15
a	15
Castilian,	15
has	15
sung	15
her	15
beauty.”	15
“Tell	15
me,	15
Señor	15
Don	15
Quixote,”	15
said	15
the	15
barber	15
here,	15
“among	15
all	15
those	15
who	15
praised	15
her,	15
has	15
there	15
been	15
no	15
poet	15
to	15
write	15
a	15
satire	15
on	15
this	15
Lady	15
Angelica?”	15
“I	15
can	15
well	15
believe,”	15
replied	15
Don	15
Quixote,	15
“that	15
if	15
Sacripante	15
or	15
Roland	15
had	15
been	15
poets	15
they	15
would	15
have	15
given	15
the	15
damsel	15
a	15
trimming;	15
for	15
it	15
is	15
naturally	15
the	15
way	15
with	15
poets	15
who	15
have	15
been	15
scorned	15
and	15
rejected	15
by	15
their	15
ladies,	15
whether	15
fictitious	15
or	15
not,	15
in	15
short	15
by	15
those	15
whom	15
they	15
select	15
as	15
the	15
ladies	15
of	15
their	15
thoughts,	15
to	15
avenge	15
themselves	15
in	15
satires	15
and	15
libels—a	15
vengeance,	15
to	15
be	15
sure,	15
unworthy	15
of	15
generous	15
hearts;	15
but	15
up	15
to	15
the	15
present	15
I	15
have	15
not	15
heard	15
of	15
any	15
defamatory	15
verse	15
against	15
the	15
Lady	15
Angelica,	15
who	15
turned	15
the	15
world	15
upside	15
down.”	15
“Strange,”	15
said	15
the	15
curate;	15
but	15
at	15
this	15
moment	15
they	15
heard	15
the	15
housekeeper	15
and	15
the	15
niece,	15
who	15
had	15
previously	15
withdrawn	15
from	15
the	15
conversation,	15
exclaiming	15
aloud	15
in	15
the	15
courtyard,	15
and	15
at	15
the	15
noise	15
they	15
all	15
ran	15
out.	15

The	15
history	15
relates	15
that	15
the	15
outcry	15
Don	15
Quixote,	15
the	15
curate,	15
and	15
the	15
barber	15
heard	15
came	15
from	15
the	15
niece	15
and	15
the	15
housekeeper	15
exclaiming	15
to	15
Sancho,	15
who	15
was	15
striving	15
to	15
force	15
his	15
way	15
in	15
to	15
see	15
Don	15
Quixote	15
while	15
they	15
held	15
the	15
door	15
against	15
him,	15
“What	15
does	15
the	15
vagabond	15
want	15
in	15
this	15
house?	15
Be	15
off	15
to	15
your	15
own,	15
brother,	15
for	15
it	15
is	15
you,	15
and	15
no	15
one	15
else,	15
that	15
delude	15
my	15
master,	15
and	15
lead	15
him	15
astray,	15
and	15
take	15
him	15
tramping	15
about	15
the	15
country.”	15
To	15
which	15
Sancho	15
replied,	15
“Devil’s	15
own	15
housekeeper!	15
it	15
is	15
I	15
who	15
am	15
deluded,	15
and	15
led	15
astray,	15
and	15
taken	15
tramping	15
about	15
the	15
country,	15
and	15
not	15
thy	15
master!	15
He	15
has	15
carried	15
me	15
all	15
over	15
the	15
world,	15
and	15
you	15
are	15
mightily	15
mistaken.	15
He	15
enticed	15
me	15
away	15
from	15
home	15
by	15
a	15
trick,	15
promising	15
me	15
an	15
island,	15
which	15
I	15
am	15
still	15
waiting	15
for.”	15
“May	15
evil	15
islands	15
choke	15
thee,	15
thou	15
detestable	15
Sancho,”	15
said	15
the	15
niece;	15
“What	15
are	15
islands?	15
Is	15
it	15
something	15
to	15
eat,	15
glutton	15
and	15
gormandiser	15
that	15
thou	15
art?”	15
“It	15
is	15
not	15
something	15
to	15
eat,”	15
replied	15
Sancho,	15
“but	15
something	15
to	15
govern	15
and	15
rule,	15
and	15
better	15
than	15
four	15
cities	15
or	15
four	15
judgeships	15
at	15
court.”	15
“For	15
all	15
that,”	15
said	15
the	15
housekeeper,	15
“you	15
don’t	15
enter	15
here,	15
you	15
bag	15
of	15
mischief	15
and	15
sack	15
of	15
knavery;	15
go	15
govern	15
your	15
house	15
and	15
dig	15
your	15
seed-patch,	15
and	15
give	15
over	15
looking	15
for	15
islands	15
or	15
shylands.”	15
The	15
curate	15
and	15
the	15
barber	15
listened	15
with	15
great	15
amusement	15
to	15
the	15
words	15
of	15
the	15
three;	15
but	15
Don	15
Quixote,	15
uneasy	15
lest	15
Sancho	15
should	15
blab	15
and	15
blurt	15
out	15
a	15
whole	15
heap	15
of	15
mischievous	15
stupidities,	15
and	15
touch	15
upon	15
points	15
that	15
might	15
not	15
be	15
altogether	15
to	15
his	15
credit,	15
called	15
to	15
him	15
and	15
made	15
the	15
other	15
two	15
hold	15
their	15
tongues	15
and	15
let	15
him	15
come	15
in.	15
Sancho	15
entered,	15
and	15
the	15
curate	15
and	15
the	15
barber	15
took	15
their	15
leave	15
of	15
Don	15
Quixote,	15
of	15
whose	15
recovery	15
they	15
despaired	15
when	15
they	15
saw	15
how	15
wedded	15
he	15
was	15
to	15
his	15
crazy	15
ideas,	15
and	15
how	15
saturated	15
with	15
the	15
nonsense	15
of	15
his	15
unlucky	15
chivalry;	15
and	15
said	15
the	15
curate	15
to	15
the	15
barber,	15
“You	15
will	15
see,	15
gossip,	15
that	15
when	15
we	15
are	15
least	15
thinking	15
of	15
it,	15
our	15
gentleman	15
will	15
be	15
off	15
once	15
more	15
for	15
another	15
flight.”	15
“I	15
have	15
no	15
doubt	15
of	15
it,”	15
returned	15
the	15
barber;	15
“but	15
I	15
do	15
not	15
wonder	15
so	15
much	15
at	15
the	15
madness	15
of	15
the	15
knight	15
as	15
at	15
the	15
simplicity	15
of	15
the	15
squire,	15
who	15
has	15
such	15
a	15
firm	15
belief	15
in	15
all	15
that	15
about	15
the	15
island,	15
that	15
I	15
suppose	15
all	15
the	15
exposures	15
that	15
could	15
be	15
imagined	15
would	15
not	15
get	15
it	15
out	15
of	15
his	15
head.”	15
“God	15
help	15
them,”	15
said	15
the	15
curate;	15
“and	15
let	15
us	15
be	15
on	15
the	15
look-out	15
to	15
see	15
what	15
comes	15
of	15
all	15
these	15
absurdities	15
of	15
the	15
knight	15
and	15
squire,	15
for	15
it	15
seems	15
as	15
if	15
they	15
had	15
both	15
been	15
cast	15
in	15
the	15
same	15
mould,	15
and	15
the	15
madness	15
of	15
the	15
master	15
without	15
the	15
simplicity	15
of	15
the	15
man	15
would	15
not	15
be	15
worth	15
a	15
farthing.”	15
“That	15
is	15
true,”	15
said	15
the	15
barber,	15
“and	15
I	15
should	15
like	15
very	15
much	15
to	15
know	15
what	15
the	15
pair	15
are	15
talking	15
about	15
at	15
this	15
moment.”	15
“I	15
promise	15
you,”	15
said	15
the	15
curate,	15
“the	15
niece	15
or	15
the	15
housekeeper	15
will	15
tell	15
us	15
by-and-by,	15
for	15
they	15
are	15
not	15
the	15
ones	15
to	15
forget	15
to	15
listen.”	15
Meanwhile	15
Don	15
Quixote	15
shut	15
himself	15
up	15
in	15
his	15
room	15
with	15
Sancho,	15
and	15
when	15
they	15
were	15
alone	15
he	15
said	15
to	15
him,	15
“It	15
grieves	15
me	15
greatly,	15
Sancho,	15
that	15
thou	15
shouldst	15
have	15
said,	15
and	15
sayest,	15
that	15
I	15
took	15
thee	15
out	15
of	15
thy	15
cottage,	15
when	15
thou	15
knowest	15
I	15
did	15
not	15
remain	15
in	15
my	15
house.	15
We	15
sallied	15
forth	15
together,	15
we	15
took	15
the	15
road	15
together,	15
we	15
wandered	15
abroad	15
together;	15
we	15
have	15
had	15
the	15
same	15
fortune	15
and	15
the	15
same	15
luck;	15
if	15
they	15
blanketed	15
thee	15
once,	15
they	15
belaboured	15
me	15
a	15
hundred	15
times,	15
and	15
that	15
is	15
the	15
only	15
advantage	15
I	15
have	15
of	15
thee.”	15
“That	15
was	15
only	15
reasonable,”	15
replied	15
Sancho,	15
“for,	15
by	15
what	15
your	15
worship	15
says,	15
misfortunes	15
belong	15
more	15
properly	15
to	15
knights-errant	15
than	15
to	15
their	15
squires.”	15
“Thou	15
art	15
mistaken,	15
Sancho,”	15
said	15
Don	15
Quixote,	15
“according	15
to	15
the	15
maxim	15
_quando	15
caput	15
dolet_,	15
etc.”	15
“I	15
don’t	15
understand	15
any	15
language	15
but	15
my	15
own,”	15
said	15
Sancho.	15
“I	15
mean	15
to	15
say,”	15
said	15
Don	15
Quixote,	15
“that	15
when	15
the	15
head	15
suffers	15
all	15
the	15
members	15
suffer;	15
and	15
so,	15
being	15
thy	15
lord	15
and	15
master,	15
I	15
am	15
thy	15
head,	15
and	15
thou	15
a	15
part	15
of	15
me	15
as	15
thou	15
art	15
my	15
servant;	15
and	15
therefore	15
any	15
evil	15
that	15
affects	15
or	15
shall	15
affect	15
me	15
should	15
give	15
thee	15
pain,	15
and	15
what	15
affects	15
thee	15
give	15
pain	15
to	15
me.”	15
“It	15
should	15
be	15
so,”	15
said	15
Sancho;	15
“but	15
when	15
I	15
was	15
blanketed	15
as	15
a	15
member,	15
my	15
head	15
was	15
on	15
the	15
other	15
side	15
of	15
the	15
wall,	15
looking	15
on	15
while	15
I	15
was	15
flying	15
through	15
the	15
air,	15
and	15
did	15
not	15
feel	15
any	15
pain	15
whatever;	15
and	15
if	15
the	15
members	15
are	15
obliged	15
to	15
feel	15
the	15
suffering	15
of	15
the	15
head,	15
it	15
should	15
be	15
obliged	15
to	15
feel	15
their	15
sufferings.”	15
“Dost	15
thou	15
mean	15
to	15
say	15
now,	15
Sancho,”	15
said	15
Don	15
Quixote,	15
“that	15
I	15
did	15
not	15
feel	15
when	15
they	15
were	15
blanketing	15
thee?	15
If	15
thou	15
dost,	15
thou	15
must	15
not	15
say	15
so	15
or	15
think	15
so,	15
for	15
I	15
felt	15
more	15
pain	15
then	15
in	15
spirit	15
than	15
thou	15
didst	15
in	15
body.	15
But	15
let	15
us	15
put	15
that	15
aside	15
for	15
the	15
present,	15
for	15
we	15
shall	15
have	15
opportunities	15
enough	15
for	15
considering	15
and	15
settling	15
the	15
point;	15
tell	15
me,	15
Sancho	15
my	15
friend,	15
what	15
do	15
they	15
say	15
about	15
me	15
in	15
the	15
village	15
here?	15
What	15
do	15
the	15
common	15
people	15
think	15
of	15
me?	15
What	15
do	15
the	15
hidalgos?	15
What	15
do	15
the	15
caballeros?	15
What	15
do	15
they	15
say	15
of	15
my	15
valour;	15
of	15
my	15
achievements;	15
of	15
my	15
courtesy?	15
How	15
do	15
they	15
treat	15
the	15
task	15
I	15
have	15
undertaken	15
in	15
reviving	15
and	15
restoring	15
to	15
the	15
world	15
the	15
now	15
forgotten	15
order	15
of	15
chivalry?	15
In	15
short,	15
Sancho,	15
I	15
would	15
have	15
thee	15
tell	15
me	15
all	15
that	15
has	15
come	15
to	15
thine	15
ears	15
on	15
this	15
subject;	15
and	15
thou	15
art	15
to	15
tell	15
me,	15
without	15
adding	15
anything	15
to	15
the	15
good	15
or	15
taking	15
away	15
anything	15
from	15
the	15
bad;	15
for	15
it	15
is	15
the	15
duty	15
of	15
loyal	15
vassals	15
to	15
tell	15
the	15
truth	15
to	15
their	15
lords	15
just	15
as	15
it	15
is	15
and	15
in	15
its	15
proper	15
shape,	15
not	15
allowing	15
flattery	15
to	15
add	15
to	15
it	15
or	15
any	15
idle	15
deference	15
to	15
lessen	15
it.	15
And	15
I	15
would	15
have	15
thee	15
know,	15
Sancho,	15
that	15
if	15
the	15
naked	15
truth,	15
undisguised	15
by	15
flattery,	15
came	15
to	15
the	15
ears	15
of	15
princes,	15
times	15
would	15
be	15
different,	15
and	15
other	15
ages	15
would	15
be	15
reckoned	15
iron	15
ages	15
more	15
than	15
ours,	15
which	15
I	15
hold	15
to	15
be	15
the	15
golden	15
of	15
these	15
latter	15
days.	15
Profit	15
by	15
this	15
advice,	15
Sancho,	15
and	15
report	15
to	15
me	15
clearly	15
and	15
faithfully	15
the	15
truth	15
of	15
what	15
thou	15
knowest	15
touching	15
what	15
I	15
have	15
demanded	15
of	15
thee.”	15
“That	15
I	15
will	15
do	15
with	15
all	15
my	15
heart,	15
master,”	15
replied	15
Sancho,	15
“provided	15
your	15
worship	15
will	15
not	15
be	15
vexed	15
at	15
what	15
I	15
say,	15
as	15
you	15
wish	15
me	15
to	15
say	15
it	15
out	15
in	15
all	15
its	15
nakedness,	15
without	15
putting	15
any	15
more	15
clothes	15
on	15
it	15
than	15
it	15
came	15
to	15
my	15
knowledge	15
in.”	15
“I	15
will	15
not	15
be	15
vexed	15
at	15
all,”	15
returned	15
Don	15
Quixote;	15
“thou	15
mayest	15
speak	15
freely,	15
Sancho,	15
and	15
without	15
any	15
beating	15
about	15
the	15
bush.”	15
“Well	15
then,”	15
said	15
he,	15
“first	15
of	15
all,	15
I	15
have	15
to	15
tell	15
you	15
that	15
the	15
common	15
people	15
consider	15
your	15
worship	15
a	15
mighty	15
great	15
madman,	15
and	15
me	15
no	15
less	15
a	15
fool.	15
The	15
hidalgos	15
say	15
that,	15
not	15
keeping	15
within	15
the	15
bounds	15
of	15
your	15
quality	15
of	15
gentleman,	15
you	15
have	15
assumed	15
the	15
‘Don,’	15
and	15
made	15
a	15
knight	15
of	15
yourself	15
at	15
a	15
jump,	15
with	15
four	15
vine-stocks	15
and	15
a	15
couple	15
of	15
acres	15
of	15
land,	15
and	15
never	15
a	15
shirt	15
to	15
your	15
back.	15
The	15
caballeros	15
say	15
they	15
do	15
not	15
want	15
to	15
have	15
hidalgos	15
setting	15
up	15
in	15
opposition	15
to	15
them,	15
particularly	15
squire	15
hidalgos	15
who	15
polish	15
their	15
own	15
shoes	15
and	15
darn	15
their	15
black	15
stockings	15
with	15
green	15
silk.”	15
“That,”	15
said	15
Don	15
Quixote,	15
“does	15
not	15
apply	15
to	15
me,	15
for	15
I	15
always	15
go	15
well	15
dressed	15
and	15
never	15
patched;	15
ragged	15
I	15
may	15
be,	15
but	15
ragged	15
more	15
from	15
the	15
wear	15
and	15
tear	15
of	15
arms	15
than	15
of	15
time.”	15
“As	15
to	15
your	15
worship’s	15
valour,	15
courtesy,	15
accomplishments,	15
and	15
task,	15
there	15
is	15
a	15
variety	15
of	15
opinions.	15
Some	15
say,	15
‘mad	15
but	15
droll;’	15
others,	15
‘valiant	15
but	15
unlucky;’	15
others,	15
‘courteous	15
but	15
meddling,’	15
and	15
then	15
they	15
go	15
into	15
such	15
a	15
number	15
of	15
things	15
that	15
they	15
don’t	15
leave	15
a	15
whole	15
bone	15
either	15
in	15
your	15
worship	15
or	15
in	15
myself.”	15
“Recollect,	15
Sancho,”	15
said	15
Don	15
Quixote,	15
“that	15
wherever	15
virtue	15
exists	15
in	15
an	15
eminent	15
degree	15
it	15
is	15
persecuted.	15
Few	15
or	15
none	15
of	15
the	15
famous	15
men	15
that	15
have	15
lived	15
escaped	15
being	15
calumniated	15
by	15
malice.	15
Julius	15
Cæsar,	15
the	15
boldest,	15
wisest,	15
and	15
bravest	15
of	15
captains,	15
was	15
charged	15
with	15
being	15
ambitious,	15
and	15
not	15
particularly	15
cleanly	15
in	15
his	15
dress,	15
or	15
pure	15
in	15
his	15
morals.	15
Of	15
Alexander,	15
whose	15
deeds	15
won	15
him	15
the	15
name	15
of	15
Great,	15
they	15
say	15
that	15
he	15
was	15
somewhat	15
of	15
a	15
drunkard.	15
Of	15
Hercules,	15
him	15
of	15
the	15
many	15
labours,	15
it	15
is	15
said	15
that	15
he	15
was	15
lewd	15
and	15
luxurious.	15
Of	15
Don	15
Galaor,	15
the	15
brother	15
of	15
Amadis	15
of	15
Gaul,	15
it	15
was	15
whispered	15
that	15
he	15
was	15
over-quarrelsome,	15
and	15
of	15
his	15
brother	15
that	15
he	15
was	15
lachrymose.	15
So	15
that,	15
O	15
Sancho,	15
amongst	15
all	15
these	15
calumnies	15
against	15
good	15
men,	15
mine	15
may	15
be	15
let	15
pass,	15
since	15
they	15
are	15
no	15
more	15
than	15
thou	15
hast	15
said.”	15
“That’s	15
just	15
where	15
it	15
is,	15
body	15
of	15
my	15
father!”	15
“Is	15
there	15
more,	15
then?”	15
asked	15
Don	15
Quixote.	15
“There’s	15
the	15
tail	15
to	15
be	15
skinned	15
yet,”	15
said	15
Sancho;	15
“all	15
so	15
far	15
is	15
cakes	15
and	15
fancy	15
bread;	15
but	15
if	15
your	15
worship	15
wants	15
to	15
know	15
all	15
about	15
the	15
calumnies	15
they	15
bring	15
against	15
you,	15
I	15
will	15
fetch	15
you	15
one	15
this	15
instant	15
who	15
can	15
tell	15
you	15
the	15
whole	15
of	15
them	15
without	15
missing	15
an	15
atom;	15
for	15
last	15
night	15
the	15
son	15
of	15
Bartholomew	15
Carrasco,	15
who	15
has	15
been	15
studying	15
at	15
Salamanca,	15
came	15
home	15
after	15
having	15
been	15
made	15
a	15
bachelor,	15
and	15
when	15
I	15
went	15
to	15
welcome	15
him,	15
he	15
told	15
me	15
that	15
your	15
worship’s	15
history	15
is	15
already	15
abroad	15
in	15
books,	15
with	15
the	15
title	15
of	15
THE	15
INGENIOUS	15
GENTLEMAN	15
DON	15
QUIXOTE	15
OF	15
LA	15
MANCHA;	15
and	15
he	15
says	15
they	15
mention	15
me	15
in	15
it	15
by	15
my	15
own	15
name	15
of	15
Sancho	15
Panza,	15
and	15
the	15
lady	15
Dulcinea	15
del	15
Toboso	15
too,	15
and	15
divers	15
things	15
that	15
happened	15
to	15
us	15
when	15
we	15
were	15
alone;	15
so	15
that	15
I	15
crossed	15
myself	15
in	15
my	15
wonder	15
how	15
the	15
historian	15
who	15
wrote	15
them	15
down	15
could	15
have	15
known	15
them.”	15
“I	15
promise	15
thee,	15
Sancho,”	15
said	15
Don	15
Quixote,	15
“the	15
author	15
of	15
our	15
history	15
will	15
be	15
some	15
sage	15
enchanter;	15
for	15
to	15
such	15
nothing	15
that	15
they	15
choose	15
to	15
write	15
about	15
is	15
hidden.”	15
“What!”	15
said	15
Sancho,	15
“a	15
sage	15
and	15
an	15
enchanter!	15
Why,	15
the	15
bachelor	15
Samson	15
Carrasco	15
(that	15
is	15
the	15
name	15
of	15
him	15
I	15
spoke	15
of)	15
says	15
the	15
author	15
of	15
the	15
history	15
is	15
called	15
Cide	15
Hamete	15
Berengena.”	15
“That	15
is	15
a	15
Moorish	15
name,”	15
said	15
Don	15
Quixote.	15
“May	15
be	15
so,”	15
replied	15
Sancho;	15
“for	15
I	15
have	15
heard	15
say	15
that	15
the	15
Moors	15
are	15
mostly	15
great	15
lovers	15
of	15
berengenas.”	15
“Thou	15
must	15
have	15
mistaken	15
the	15
surname	15
of	15
this	15
‘Cide’—which	15
means	15
in	15
Arabic	15
‘Lord’—Sancho,”	15
observed	15
Don	15
Quixote.	15
“Very	15
likely,”	15
replied	15
Sancho,	15
“but	15
if	15
your	15
worship	15
wishes	15
me	15
to	15
fetch	15
the	15
bachelor	15
I	15
will	15
go	15
for	15
him	15
in	15
a	15
twinkling.”	15
“Thou	15
wilt	15
do	15
me	15
a	15
great	15
pleasure,	15
my	15
friend,”	15
said	15
Don	15
Quixote,	15
“for	15
what	15
thou	15
hast	15
told	15
me	15
has	15
amazed	15
me,	15
and	15
I	15
shall	15
not	15
eat	15
a	15
morsel	15
that	15
will	15
agree	15
with	15
me	15
until	15
I	15
have	15
heard	15
all	15
about	15
it.”	15
“Then	15
I	15
am	15
off	15
for	15
him,”	15
said	15
Sancho;	15
and	15
leaving	15
his	15
master	15
he	15
went	15
in	15
quest	15
of	15
the	15
bachelor,	15
with	15
whom	15
he	15
returned	15
in	15
a	15
short	15
time,	15
and,	15
all	15
three	15
together,	15
they	15
had	15
a	15
very	15
droll	15
colloquy.	15

Full	15

Don	15
Quixote	15
remained	15
very	15
deep	15
in	15
thought,	15
waiting	15
for	15
the	15
bachelor	15
Carrasco,	15
from	15
whom	15
he	15
was	15
to	15
hear	15
how	15
he	15
himself	15
had	15
been	15
put	15
into	15
a	15
book	15
as	15
Sancho	15
said;	15
and	15
he	15
could	15
not	15
persuade	15
himself	15
that	15
any	15
such	15
history	15
could	15
be	15
in	15
existence,	15
for	15
the	15
blood	15
of	15
the	15
enemies	15
he	15
had	15
slain	15
was	15
not	15
yet	15
dry	15
on	15
the	15
blade	15
of	15
his	15
sword,	15
and	15
now	15
they	15
wanted	15
to	15
make	15
out	15
that	15
his	15
mighty	15
achievements	15
were	15
going	15
about	15
in	15
print.	15
For	15
all	15
that,	15
he	15
fancied	15
some	15
sage,	15
either	15
a	15
friend	15
or	15
an	15
enemy,	15
might,	15
by	15
the	15
aid	15
of	15
magic,	15
have	15
given	15
them	15
to	15
the	15
press;	15
if	15
a	15
friend,	15
in	15
order	15
to	15
magnify	15
and	15
exalt	15
them	15
above	15
the	15
most	15
famous	15
ever	15
achieved	15
by	15
any	15
knight-errant;	15
if	15
an	15
enemy,	15
to	15
bring	15
them	15
to	15
naught	15
and	15
degrade	15
them	15
below	15
the	15
meanest	15
ever	15
recorded	15
of	15
any	15
low	15
squire,	15
though	15
as	15
he	15
said	15
to	15
himself,	15
the	15
achievements	15
of	15
squires	15
never	15
were	15
recorded.	15
If,	15
however,	15
it	15
were	15
the	15
fact	15
that	15
such	15
a	15
history	15
were	15
in	15
existence,	15
it	15
must	15
necessarily,	15
being	15
the	15
story	15
of	15
a	15
knight-errant,	15
be	15
grandiloquent,	15
lofty,	15
imposing,	15
grand	15
and	15
true.	15
With	15
this	15
he	15
comforted	15
himself	15
somewhat,	15
though	15
it	15
made	15
him	15
uncomfortable	15
to	15
think	15
that	15
the	15
author	15
was	15
a	15
Moor,	15
judging	15
by	15
the	15
title	15
of	15
“Cide;”	15
and	15
that	15
no	15
truth	15
was	15
to	15
be	15
looked	15
for	15
from	15
Moors,	15
as	15
they	15
are	15
all	15
impostors,	15
cheats,	15
and	15
schemers.	15
He	15
was	15
afraid	15
he	15
might	15
have	15
dealt	15
with	15
his	15
love	15
affairs	15
in	15
some	15
indecorous	15
fashion,	15
that	15
might	15
tend	15
to	15
the	15
discredit	15
and	15
prejudice	15
of	15
the	15
purity	15
of	15
his	15
lady	15
Dulcinea	15
del	15
Toboso;	15
he	15
would	15
have	15
had	15
him	15
set	15
forth	15
the	15
fidelity	15
and	15
respect	15
he	15
had	15
always	15
observed	15
towards	15
her,	15
spurning	15
queens,	15
empresses,	15
and	15
damsels	15
of	15
all	15
sorts,	15
and	15
keeping	15
in	15
check	15
the	15
impetuosity	15
of	15
his	15
natural	15
impulses.	15
Absorbed	15
and	15
wrapped	15
up	15
in	15
these	15
and	15
divers	15
other	15
cogitations,	15
he	15
was	15
found	15
by	15
Sancho	15
and	15
Carrasco,	15
whom	15
Don	15
Quixote	15
received	15
with	15
great	15
courtesy.	15
The	15
bachelor,	15
though	15
he	15
was	15
called	15
Samson,	15
was	15
of	15
no	15
great	15
bodily	15
size,	15
but	15
he	15
was	15
a	15
very	15
great	15
wag;	15
he	15
was	15
of	15
a	15
sallow	15
complexion,	15
but	15
very	15
sharp-witted,	15
somewhere	15
about	15
four-and-twenty	15
years	15
of	15
age,	15
with	15
a	15
round	15
face,	15
a	15
flat	15
nose,	15
and	15
a	15
large	15
mouth,	15
all	15
indications	15
of	15
a	15
mischievous	15
disposition	15
and	15
a	15
love	15
of	15
fun	15
and	15
jokes;	15
and	15
of	15
this	15
he	15
gave	15
a	15
sample	15
as	15
soon	15
as	15
he	15
saw	15
Don	15
Quixote,	15
by	15
falling	15
on	15
his	15
knees	15
before	15
him	15
and	15
saying,	15
“Let	15
me	15
kiss	15
your	15
mightiness’s	15
hand,	15
Señor	15
Don	15
Quixote	15
of	15
La	15
Mancha,	15
for,	15
by	15
the	15
habit	15
of	15
St.	15
Peter	15
that	15
I	15
wear,	15
though	15
I	15
have	15
no	15
more	15
than	15
the	15
first	15
four	15
orders,	15
your	15
worship	15
is	15
one	15
of	15
the	15
most	15
famous	15
knights-errant	15
that	15
have	15
ever	15
been,	15
or	15
will	15
be,	15
all	15
the	15
world	15
over.	15
A	15
blessing	15
on	15
Cide	15
Hamete	15
Benengeli,	15
who	15
has	15
written	15
the	15
history	15
of	15
your	15
great	15
deeds,	15
and	15
a	15
double	15
blessing	15
on	15
that	15
connoisseur	15
who	15
took	15
the	15
trouble	15
of	15
having	15
it	15
translated	15
out	15
of	15
the	15
Arabic	15
into	15
our	15
Castilian	15
vulgar	15
tongue	15
for	15
the	15
universal	15
entertainment	15
of	15
the	15
people!”	15
Don	15
Quixote	15
made	15
him	15
rise,	15
and	15
said,	15
“So,	15
then,	15
it	15
is	15
true	15
that	15
there	15
is	15
a	15
history	15
of	15
me,	15
and	15
that	15
it	15
was	15
a	15
Moor	15
and	15
a	15
sage	15
who	15
wrote	15
it?”	15
“So	15
true	15
is	15
it,	15
señor,”	15
said	15
Samson,	15
“that	15
my	15
belief	15
is	15
there	15
are	15
more	15
than	15
twelve	15
thousand	15
volumes	15
of	15
the	15
said	15
history	15
in	15
print	15
this	15
very	15
day.	15
Only	15
ask	15
Portugal,	15
Barcelona,	15
and	15
Valencia,	15
where	15
they	15
have	15
been	15
printed,	15
and	15
moreover	15
there	15
is	15
a	15
report	15
that	15
it	15
is	15
being	15
printed	15
at	15
Antwerp,	15
and	15
I	15
am	15
persuaded	15
there	15
will	15
not	15
be	15
a	15
country	15
or	15
language	15
in	15
which	15
there	15
will	15
not	15
be	15
a	15
translation	15
of	15
it.”	15
“One	15
of	15
the	15
things,”	15
here	15
observed	15
Don	15
Quixote,	15
“that	15
ought	15
to	15
give	15
most	15
pleasure	15
to	15
a	15
virtuous	15
and	15
eminent	15
man	15
is	15
to	15
find	15
himself	15
in	15
his	15
lifetime	15
in	15
print	15
and	15
in	15
type,	15
familiar	15
in	15
people’s	15
mouths	15
with	15
a	15
good	15
name;	15
I	15
say	15
with	15
a	15
good	15
name,	15
for	15
if	15
it	15
be	15
the	15
opposite,	15
then	15
there	15
is	15
no	15
death	15
to	15
be	15
compared	15
to	15
it.”	15
“If	15
it	15
goes	15
by	15
good	15
name	15
and	15
fame,”	15
said	15
the	15
bachelor,	15
“your	15
worship	15
alone	15
bears	15
away	15
the	15
palm	15
from	15
all	15
the	15
knights-errant;	15
for	15
the	15
Moor	15
in	15
his	15
own	15
language,	15
and	15
the	15
Christian	15
in	15
his,	15
have	15
taken	15
care	15
to	15
set	15
before	15
us	15
your	15
gallantry,	15
your	15
high	15
courage	15
in	15
encountering	15
dangers,	15
your	15
fortitude	15
in	15
adversity,	15
your	15
patience	15
under	15
misfortunes	15
as	15
well	15
as	15
wounds,	15
the	15
purity	15
and	15
continence	15
of	15
the	15
platonic	15
loves	15
of	15
your	15
worship	15
and	15
my	15
lady	15
Doña	15
Dulcinea	15
del	15
Toboso—”	15
“I	15
never	15
heard	15
my	15
lady	15
Dulcinea	15
called	15
Doña,”	15
observed	15
Sancho	15
here;	15
“nothing	15
more	15
than	15
the	15
lady	15
Dulcinea	15
del	15
Toboso;	15
so	15
here	15
already	15
the	15
history	15
is	15
wrong.”	15
“That	15
is	15
not	15
an	15
objection	15
of	15
any	15
importance,”	15
replied	15
Carrasco.	15
“Certainly	15
not,”	15
said	15
Don	15
Quixote;	15
“but	15
tell	15
me,	15
señor	15
bachelor,	15
what	15
deeds	15
of	15
mine	15
are	15
they	15
that	15
are	15
made	15
most	15
of	15
in	15
this	15
history?”	15
“On	15
that	15
point,”	15
replied	15
the	15
bachelor,	15
“opinions	15
differ,	15
as	15
tastes	15
do;	15
some	15
swear	15
by	15
the	15
adventure	15
of	15
the	15
windmills	15
that	15
your	15
worship	15
took	15
to	15
be	15
Briareuses	15
and	15
giants;	15
others	15
by	15
that	15
of	15
the	15
fulling	15
mills;	15
one	15
cries	15
up	15
the	15
description	15
of	15
the	15
two	15
armies	15
that	15
afterwards	15
took	15
the	15
appearance	15
of	15
two	15
droves	15
of	15
sheep;	15
another	15
that	15
of	15
the	15
dead	15
body	15
on	15
its	15
way	15
to	15
be	15
buried	15
at	15
Segovia;	15
a	15
third	15
says	15
the	15
liberation	15
of	15
the	15
galley	15
slaves	15
is	15
the	15
best	15
of	15
all,	15
and	15
a	15
fourth	15
that	15
nothing	15
comes	15
up	15
to	15
the	15
affair	15
with	15
the	15
Benedictine	15
giants,	15
and	15
the	15
battle	15
with	15
the	15
valiant	15
Biscayan.”	15
“Tell	15
me,	15
señor	15
bachelor,”	15
said	15
Sancho	15
at	15
this	15
point,	15
“does	15
the	15
adventure	15
with	15
the	15
Yanguesans	15
come	15
in,	15
when	15
our	15
good	15
Rocinante	15
went	15
hankering	15
after	15
dainties?”	15
“The	15
sage	15
has	15
left	15
nothing	15
in	15
the	15
ink-bottle,”	15
replied	15
Samson;	15
“he	15
tells	15
all	15
and	15
sets	15
down	15
everything,	15
even	15
to	15
the	15
capers	15
that	15
worthy	15
Sancho	15
cut	15
in	15
the	15
blanket.”	15
“I	15
cut	15
no	15
capers	15
in	15
the	15
blanket,”	15
returned	15
Sancho;	15
“in	15
the	15
air	15
I	15
did,	15
and	15
more	15
of	15
them	15
than	15
I	15
liked.”	15
“There	15
is	15
no	15
human	15
history	15
in	15
the	15
world,	15
I	15
suppose,”	15
said	15
Don	15
Quixote,	15
“that	15
has	15
not	15
its	15
ups	15
and	15
downs,	15
but	15
more	15
than	15
others	15
such	15
as	15
deal	15
with	15
chivalry,	15
for	15
they	15
can	15
never	15
be	15
entirely	15
made	15
up	15
of	15
prosperous	15
adventures.”	15
“For	15
all	15
that,”	15
replied	15
the	15
bachelor,	15
“there	15
are	15
those	15
who	15
have	15
read	15
the	15
history	15
who	15
say	15
they	15
would	15
have	15
been	15
glad	15
if	15
the	15
author	15
had	15
left	15
out	15
some	15
of	15
the	15
countless	15
cudgellings	15
that	15
were	15
inflicted	15
on	15
Señor	15
Don	15
Quixote	15
in	15
various	15
encounters.”	15
“That’s	15
where	15
the	15
truth	15
of	15
the	15
history	15
comes	15
in,”	15
said	15
Sancho.	15
“At	15
the	15
same	15
time	15
they	15
might	15
fairly	15
have	15
passed	15
them	15
over	15
in	15
silence,”	15
observed	15
Don	15
Quixote;	15
“for	15
there	15
is	15
no	15
need	15
of	15
recording	15
events	15
which	15
do	15
not	15
change	15
or	15
affect	15
the	15
truth	15
of	15
a	15
history,	15
if	15
they	15
tend	15
to	15
bring	15
the	15
hero	15
of	15
it	15
into	15
contempt.	15
Æneas	15
was	15
not	15
in	15
truth	15
and	15
earnest	15
so	15
pious	15
as	15
Virgil	15
represents	15
him,	15
nor	15
Ulysses	15
so	15
wise	15
as	15
Homer	15
describes	15
him.”	15
“That	15
is	15
true,”	15
said	15
Samson;	15
“but	15
it	15
is	15
one	15
thing	15
to	15
write	15
as	15
a	15
poet,	15
another	15
to	15
write	15
as	15
a	15
historian;	15
the	15
poet	15
may	15
describe	15
or	15
sing	15
things,	15
not	15
as	15
they	15
were,	15
but	15
as	15
they	15
ought	15
to	15
have	15
been;	15
but	15
the	15
historian	15
has	15
to	15
write	15
them	15
down,	15
not	15
as	15
they	15
ought	15
to	15
have	15
been,	15
but	15
as	15
they	15
were,	15
without	15
adding	15
anything	15
to	15
the	15
truth	15
or	15
taking	15
anything	15
from	15
it.”	15
“Well	15
then,”	15
said	15
Sancho,	15
“if	15
this	15
señor	15
Moor	15
goes	15
in	15
for	15
telling	15
the	15
truth,	15
no	15
doubt	15
among	15
my	15
master’s	15
drubbings	15
mine	15
are	15
to	15
be	15
found;	15
for	15
they	15
never	15
took	15
the	15
measure	15
of	15
his	15
worship’s	15
shoulders	15
without	15
doing	15
the	15
same	15
for	15
my	15
whole	15
body;	15
but	15
I	15
have	15
no	15
right	15
to	15
wonder	15
at	15
that,	15
for,	15
as	15
my	15
master	15
himself	15
says,	15
the	15
members	15
must	15
share	15
the	15
pain	15
of	15
the	15
head.”	15
“You	15
are	15
a	15
sly	15
dog,	15
Sancho,”	15
said	15
Don	15
Quixote;	15
“i’	15
faith,	15
you	15
have	15
no	15
want	15
of	15
memory	15
when	15
you	15
choose	15
to	15
remember.”	15
“If	15
I	15
were	15
to	15
try	15
to	15
forget	15
the	15
thwacks	15
they	15
gave	15
me,”	15
said	15
Sancho,	15
“my	15
weals	15
would	15
not	15
let	15
me,	15
for	15
they	15
are	15
still	15
fresh	15
on	15
my	15
ribs.”	15
“Hush,	15
Sancho,”	15
said	15
Don	15
Quixote,	15
“and	15
don’t	15
interrupt	15
the	15
bachelor,	15
whom	15
I	15
entreat	15
to	15
go	15
on	15
and	15
tell	15
all	15
that	15
is	15
said	15
about	15
me	15
in	15
this	15
history.”	15
“And	15
about	15
me,”	15
said	15
Sancho,	15
“for	15
they	15
say,	15
too,	15
that	15
I	15
am	15
one	15
of	15
the	15
principal	15
presonages	15
in	15
it.”	15
“Personages,	15
not	15
presonages,	15
friend	15
Sancho,”	15
said	15
Samson.	15
“What!	15
Another	15
word-catcher!”	15
said	15
Sancho;	15
“if	15
that’s	15
to	15
be	15
the	15
way	15
we	15
shall	15
not	15
make	15
an	15
end	15
in	15
a	15
lifetime.”	15
“May	15
God	15
shorten	15
mine,	15
Sancho,”	15
returned	15
the	15
bachelor,	15
“if	15
you	15
are	15
not	15
the	15
second	15
person	15
in	15
the	15
history,	15
and	15
there	15
are	15
even	15
some	15
who	15
would	15
rather	15
hear	15
you	15
talk	15
than	15
the	15
cleverest	15
in	15
the	15
whole	15
book;	15
though	15
there	15
are	15
some,	15
too,	15
who	15
say	15
you	15
showed	15
yourself	15
over-credulous	15
in	15
believing	15
there	15
was	15
any	15
possibility	15
in	15
the	15
government	15
of	15
that	15
island	15
offered	15
you	15
by	15
Señor	15
Don	15
Quixote.”	15
“There	15
is	15
still	15
sunshine	15
on	15
the	15
wall,”	15
said	15
Don	15
Quixote;	15
“and	15
when	15
Sancho	15
is	15
somewhat	15
more	15
advanced	15
in	15
life,	15
with	15
the	15
experience	15
that	15
years	15
bring,	15
he	15
will	15
be	15
fitter	15
and	15
better	15
qualified	15
for	15
being	15
a	15
governor	15
than	15
he	15
is	15
at	15
present.”	15
“By	15
God,	15
master,”	15
said	15
Sancho,	15
“the	15
island	15
that	15
I	15
cannot	15
govern	15
with	15
the	15
years	15
I	15
have,	15
I’ll	15
not	15
be	15
able	15
to	15
govern	15
with	15
the	15
years	15
of	15
Methuselah;	15
the	15
difficulty	15
is	15
that	15
the	15
said	15
island	15
keeps	15
its	15
distance	15
somewhere,	15
I	15
know	15
not	15
where;	15
and	15
not	15
that	15
there	15
is	15
any	15
want	15
of	15
head	15
in	15
me	15
to	15
govern	15
it.”	15
“Leave	15
it	15
to	15
God,	15
Sancho,”	15
said	15
Don	15
Quixote,	15
“for	15
all	15
will	15
be	15
and	15
perhaps	15
better	15
than	15
you	15
think;	15
no	15
leaf	15
on	15
the	15
tree	15
stirs	15
but	15
by	15
God’s	15
will.”	15
“That	15
is	15
true,”	15
said	15
Samson;	15
“and	15
if	15
it	15
be	15
God’s	15
will,	15
there	15
will	15
not	15
be	15
any	15
want	15
of	15
a	15
thousand	15
islands,	15
much	15
less	15
one,	15
for	15
Sancho	15
to	15
govern.”	15
“I	15
have	15
seen	15
governors	15
in	15
these	15
parts,”	15
said	15
Sancho,	15
“that	15
are	15
not	15
to	15
be	15
compared	15
to	15
my	15
shoe-sole;	15
and	15
for	15
all	15
that	15
they	15
are	15
called	15
‘your	15
lordship’	15
and	15
served	15
on	15
silver.”	15
“Those	15
are	15
not	15
governors	15
of	15
islands,”	15
observed	15
Samson,	15
“but	15
of	15
other	15
governments	15
of	15
an	15
easier	15
kind:	15
those	15
that	15
govern	15
islands	15
must	15
at	15
least	15
know	15
grammar.”	15
“I	15
could	15
manage	15
the	15
gram	15
well	15
enough,”	15
said	15
Sancho;	15
“but	15
for	15
the	15
mar	15
I	15
have	15
neither	15
leaning	15
nor	15
liking,	15
for	15
I	15
don’t	15
know	15
what	15
it	15
is;	15
but	15
leaving	15
this	15
matter	15
of	15
the	15
government	15
in	15
God’s	15
hands,	15
to	15
send	15
me	15
wherever	15
it	15
may	15
be	15
most	15
to	15
his	15
service,	15
I	15
may	15
tell	15
you,	15
señor	15
bachelor	15
Samson	15
Carrasco,	15
it	15
has	15
pleased	15
me	15
beyond	15
measure	15
that	15
the	15
author	15
of	15
this	15
history	15
should	15
have	15
spoken	15
of	15
me	15
in	15
such	15
a	15
way	15
that	15
what	15
is	15
said	15
of	15
me	15
gives	15
no	15
offence;	15
for,	15
on	15
the	15
faith	15
of	15
a	15
true	15
squire,	15
if	15
he	15
had	15
said	15
anything	15
about	15
me	15
that	15
was	15
at	15
all	15
unbecoming	15
an	15
old	15
Christian,	15
such	15
as	15
I	15
am,	15
the	15
deaf	15
would	15
have	15
heard	15
of	15
it.”	15
“That	15
would	15
be	15
working	15
miracles,”	15
said	15
Samson.	15
“Miracles	15
or	15
no	15
miracles,”	15
said	15
Sancho,	15
“let	15
everyone	15
mind	15
how	15
he	15
speaks	15
or	15
writes	15
about	15
people,	15
and	15
not	15
set	15
down	15
at	15
random	15
the	15
first	15
thing	15
that	15
comes	15
into	15
his	15
head.”	15
“One	15
of	15
the	15
faults	15
they	15
find	15
with	15
this	15
history,”	15
said	15
the	15
bachelor,	15
“is	15
that	15
its	15
author	15
inserted	15
in	15
it	15
a	15
novel	15
called	15
‘The	15
Ill-advised	15
Curiosity;’	15
not	15
that	15
it	15
is	15
bad	15
or	15
ill-told,	15
but	15
that	15
it	15
is	15
out	15
of	15
place	15
and	15
has	15
nothing	15
to	15
do	15
with	15
the	15
history	15
of	15
his	15
worship	15
Señor	15
Don	15
Quixote.”	15
“I	15
will	15
bet	15
the	15
son	15
of	15
a	15
dog	15
has	15
mixed	15
the	15
cabbages	15
and	15
the	15
baskets,”	15
said	15
Sancho.	15
“Then,	15
I	15
say,”	15
said	15
Don	15
Quixote,	15
“the	15
author	15
of	15
my	15
history	15
was	15
no	15
sage,	15
but	15
some	15
ignorant	15
chatterer,	15
who,	15
in	15
a	15
haphazard	15
and	15
heedless	15
way,	15
set	15
about	15
writing	15
it,	15
let	15
it	15
turn	15
out	15
as	15
it	15
might,	15
just	15
as	15
Orbaneja,	15
the	15
painter	15
of	15
Úbeda,	15
used	15
to	15
do,	15
who,	15
when	15
they	15
asked	15
him	15
what	15
he	15
was	15
painting,	15
answered,	15
‘What	15
it	15
may	15
turn	15
out.’	15
Sometimes	15
he	15
would	15
paint	15
a	15
cock	15
in	15
such	15
a	15
fashion,	15
and	15
so	15
unlike,	15
that	15
he	15
had	15
to	15
write	15
alongside	15
of	15
it	15
in	15
Gothic	15
letters,	15
‘This	15
is	15
a	15
cock;	15
and	15
so	15
it	15
will	15
be	15
with	15
my	15
history,	15
which	15
will	15
require	15
a	15
commentary	15
to	15
make	15
it	15
intelligible.”	15
“No	15
fear	15
of	15
that,”	15
returned	15
Samson,	15
“for	15
it	15
is	15
so	15
plain	15
that	15
there	15
is	15
nothing	15
in	15
it	15
to	15
puzzle	15
over;	15
the	15
children	15
turn	15
its	15
leaves,	15
the	15
young	15
people	15
read	15
it,	15
the	15
grown	15
men	15
understand	15
it,	15
the	15
old	15
folk	15
praise	15
it;	15
in	15
a	15
word,	15
it	15
is	15
so	15
thumbed,	15
and	15
read,	15
and	15
got	15
by	15
heart	15
by	15
people	15
of	15
all	15
sorts,	15
that	15
the	15
instant	15
they	15
see	15
any	15
lean	15
hack,	15
they	15
say,	15
‘There	15
goes	15
Rocinante.’	15
And	15
those	15
that	15
are	15
most	15
given	15
to	15
reading	15
it	15
are	15
the	15
pages,	15
for	15
there	15
is	15
not	15
a	15
lord’s	15
ante-chamber	15
where	15
there	15
is	15
not	15
a	15
‘Don	15
Quixote’	15
to	15
be	15
found;	15
one	15
takes	15
it	15
up	15
if	15
another	15
lays	15
it	15
down;	15
this	15
one	15
pounces	15
upon	15
it,	15
and	15
that	15
begs	15
for	15
it.	15
In	15
short,	15
the	15
said	15
history	15
is	15
the	15
most	15
delightful	15
and	15
least	15
injurious	15
entertainment	15
that	15
has	15
been	15
hitherto	15
seen,	15
for	15
there	15
is	15
not	15
to	15
be	15
found	15
in	15
the	15
whole	15
of	15
it	15
even	15
the	15
semblance	15
of	15
an	15
immodest	15
word,	15
or	15
a	15
thought	15
that	15
is	15
other	15
than	15
Catholic.”	15
“To	15
write	15
in	15
any	15
other	15
way,”	15
said	15
Don	15
Quixote,	15
“would	15
not	15
be	15
to	15
write	15
truth,	15
but	15
falsehood,	15
and	15
historians	15
who	15
have	15
recourse	15
to	15
falsehood	15
ought	15
to	15
be	15
burned,	15
like	15
those	15
who	15
coin	15
false	15
money;	15
and	15
I	15
know	15
not	15
what	15
could	15
have	15
led	15
the	15
author	15
to	15
have	15
recourse	15
to	15
novels	15
and	15
irrelevant	15
stories,	15
when	15
he	15
had	15
so	15
much	15
to	15
write	15
about	15
in	15
mine;	15
no	15
doubt	15
he	15
must	15
have	15
gone	15
by	15
the	15
proverb	15
‘with	15
straw	15
or	15
with	15
hay,	15
etc,’	15
for	15
by	15
merely	15
setting	15
forth	15
my	15
thoughts,	15
my	15
sighs,	15
my	15
tears,	15
my	15
lofty	15
purposes,	15
my	15
enterprises,	15
he	15
might	15
have	15
made	15
a	15
volume	15
as	15
large,	15
or	15
larger	15
than	15
all	15
the	15
works	15
of	15
El	15
Tostado	15
would	15
make	15
up.	15
In	15
fact,	15
the	15
conclusion	15
I	15
arrive	15
at,	15
señor	15
bachelor,	15
is,	15
that	15
to	15
write	15
histories,	15
or	15
books	15
of	15
any	15
kind,	15
there	15
is	15
need	15
of	15
great	15
judgment	15
and	15
a	15
ripe	15
understanding.	15
To	15
give	15
expression	15
to	15
humour,	15
and	15
write	15
in	15
a	15
strain	15
of	15
graceful	15
pleasantry,	15
is	15
the	15
gift	15
of	15
great	15
geniuses.	15
The	15
cleverest	15
character	15
in	15
comedy	15
is	15
the	15
clown,	15
for	15
he	15
who	15
would	15
make	15
people	15
take	15
him	15
for	15
a	15
fool,	15
must	15
not	15
be	15
one.	15
History	15
is	15
in	15
a	15
measure	15
a	15
sacred	15
thing,	15
for	15
it	15
should	15
be	15
true,	15
and	15
where	15
the	15
truth	15
is,	15
there	15
God	15
is;	15
but	15
notwithstanding	15
this,	15
there	15
are	15
some	15
who	15
write	15
and	15
fling	15
books	15
broadcast	15
on	15
the	15
world	15
as	15
if	15
they	15
were	15
fritters.”	15
“There	15
is	15
no	15
book	15
so	15
bad	15
but	15
it	15
has	15
something	15
good	15
in	15
it,”	15
said	15
the	15
bachelor.	15
“No	15
doubt	15
of	15
that,”	15
replied	15
Don	15
Quixote;	15
“but	15
it	15
often	15
happens	15
that	15
those	15
who	15
have	15
acquired	15
and	15
attained	15
a	15
well-deserved	15
reputation	15
by	15
their	15
writings,	15
lose	15
it	15
entirely,	15
or	15
damage	15
it	15
in	15
some	15
degree,	15
when	15
they	15
give	15
them	15
to	15
the	15
press.”	15
“The	15
reason	15
of	15
that,”	15
said	15
Samson,	15
“is,	15
that	15
as	15
printed	15
works	15
are	15
examined	15
leisurely,	15
their	15
faults	15
are	15
easily	15
seen;	15
and	15
the	15
greater	15
the	15
fame	15
of	15
the	15
writer,	15
the	15
more	15
closely	15
are	15
they	15
scrutinised.	15
Men	15
famous	15
for	15
their	15
genius,	15
great	15
poets,	15
illustrious	15
historians,	15
are	15
always,	15
or	15
most	15
commonly,	15
envied	15
by	15
those	15
who	15
take	15
a	15
particular	15
delight	15
and	15
pleasure	15
in	15
criticising	15
the	15
writings	15
of	15
others,	15
without	15
having	15
produced	15
any	15
of	15
their	15
own.”	15
“That	15
is	15
no	15
wonder,”	15
said	15
Don	15
Quixote;	15
“for	15
there	15
are	15
many	15
divines	15
who	15
are	15
no	15
good	15
for	15
the	15
pulpit,	15
but	15
excellent	15
in	15
detecting	15
the	15
defects	15
or	15
excesses	15
of	15
those	15
who	15
preach.”	15
“All	15
that	15
is	15
true,	15
Señor	15
Don	15
Quixote,”	15
said	15
Carrasco;	15
“but	15
I	15
wish	15
such	15
fault-finders	15
were	15
more	15
lenient	15
and	15
less	15
exacting,	15
and	15
did	15
not	15
pay	15
so	15
much	15
attention	15
to	15
the	15
spots	15
on	15
the	15
bright	15
sun	15
of	15
the	15
work	15
they	15
grumble	15
at;	15
for	15
if	15
_aliquando	15
bonus	15
dormitat	15
Homerus_,	15
they	15
should	15
remember	15
how	15
long	15
he	15
remained	15
awake	15
to	15
shed	15
the	15
light	15
of	15
his	15
work	15
with	15
as	15
little	15
shade	15
as	15
possible;	15
and	15
perhaps	15
it	15
may	15
be	15
that	15
what	15
they	15
find	15
fault	15
with	15
may	15
be	15
moles,	15
that	15
sometimes	15
heighten	15
the	15
beauty	15
of	15
the	15
face	15
that	15
bears	15
them;	15
and	15
so	15
I	15
say	15
very	15
great	15
is	15
the	15
risk	15
to	15
which	15
he	15
who	15
prints	15
a	15
book	15
exposes	15
himself,	15
for	15
of	15
all	15
impossibilities	15
the	15
greatest	15
is	15
to	15
write	15
one	15
that	15
will	15
satisfy	15
and	15
please	15
all	15
readers.”	15
“That	15
which	15
treats	15
of	15
me	15
must	15
have	15
pleased	15
few,”	15
said	15
Don	15
Quixote.	15
“Quite	15
the	15
contrary,”	15
said	15
the	15
bachelor;	15
“for,	15
as	15
_stultorum	15
infinitum	15
est	15
numerus_,	15
innumerable	15
are	15
those	15
who	15
have	15
relished	15
the	15
said	15
history;	15
but	15
some	15
have	15
brought	15
a	15
charge	15
against	15
the	15
author’s	15
memory,	15
inasmuch	15
as	15
he	15
forgot	15
to	15
say	15
who	15
the	15
thief	15
was	15
who	15
stole	15
Sancho’s	15
Dapple;	15
for	15
it	15
is	15
not	15
stated	15
there,	15
but	15
only	15
to	15
be	15
inferred	15
from	15
what	15
is	15
set	15
down,	15
that	15
he	15
was	15
stolen,	15
and	15
a	15
little	15
farther	15
on	15
we	15
see	15
Sancho	15
mounted	15
on	15
the	15
same	15
ass,	15
without	15
any	15
reappearance	15
of	15
it.	15
They	15
say,	15
too,	15
that	15
he	15
forgot	15
to	15
state	15
what	15
Sancho	15
did	15
with	15
those	15
hundred	15
crowns	15
that	15
he	15
found	15
in	15
the	15
valise	15
in	15
the	15
Sierra	15
Morena,	15
as	15
he	15
never	15
alludes	15
to	15
them	15
again,	15
and	15
there	15
are	15
many	15
who	15
would	15
be	15
glad	15
to	15
know	15
what	15
he	15
did	15
with	15
them,	15
or	15
what	15
he	15
spent	15
them	15
on,	15
for	15
it	15
is	15
one	15
of	15
the	15
serious	15
omissions	15
of	15
the	15
work.”	15
“Señor	15
Samson,	15
I	15
am	15
not	15
in	15
a	15
humour	15
now	15
for	15
going	15
into	15
accounts	15
or	15
explanations,”	15
said	15
Sancho;	15
“for	15
there’s	15
a	15
sinking	15
of	15
the	15
stomach	15
come	15
over	15
me,	15
and	15
unless	15
I	15
doctor	15
it	15
with	15
a	15
couple	15
of	15
sups	15
of	15
the	15
old	15
stuff	15
it	15
will	15
put	15
me	15
on	15
the	15
thorn	15
of	15
Santa	15
Lucia.	15
I	15
have	15
it	15
at	15
home,	15
and	15
my	15
old	15
woman	15
is	15
waiting	15
for	15
me;	15
after	15
dinner	15
I’ll	15
come	15
back,	15
and	15
will	15
answer	15
you	15
and	15
all	15
the	15
world	15
every	15
question	15
you	15
may	15
choose	15
to	15
ask,	15
as	15
well	15
about	15
the	15
loss	15
of	15
the	15

about	15

and	15
without	15
another	15
word	15
or	15
waiting	15
for	15
a	15
reply	15
he	15
made	15
off	15
home.	15
Don	15
Quixote	15
begged	15
and	15
entreated	15
the	15
bachelor	15
to	15
stay	15
and	15
do	15
penance	15
with	15
him.	15
The	15
bachelor	15
accepted	15
the	15
invitation	15
and	15
remained,	15
a	15
couple	15
of	15
young	15
pigeons	15
were	15
added	15
to	15
the	15
ordinary	15
fare,	15
at	15
dinner	15
they	15
talked	15
chivalry,	15
Carrasco	15
fell	15
in	15
with	15
his	15
host’s	15
humour,	15
the	15
banquet	15
came	15
to	15
an	15
end,	15
they	15
took	15
their	15
afternoon	15
sleep,	15
Sancho	15
returned,	15
and	15
their	15
conversation	15
was	15
resumed.	15

Sancho	15
came	15
back	15
to	15
Don	15
Quixote’s	15
house,	15
and	15
returning	15
to	15
the	15
late	15
subject	15
of	15
conversation,	15
he	15
said,	15
“As	15
to	15
what	15
Señor	15
Samson	15
said,	15
that	15
he	15
would	15
like	15
to	15
know	15
by	15
whom,	15
or	15
how,	15
or	15
when	15
my	15
ass	15
was	15
stolen,	15
I	15
say	15
in	15
reply	15
that	15
the	15
same	15
night	15
we	15
went	15
into	15
the	15
Sierra	15
Morena,	15
flying	15
from	15
the	15
Holy	15
Brotherhood	15
after	15
that	15
unlucky	15
adventure	15
of	15
the	15
galley	15
slaves,	15
and	15
the	15
other	15
of	15
the	15
corpse	15
that	15
was	15
going	15
to	15
Segovia,	15
my	15
master	15
and	15
I	15
ensconced	15
ourselves	15
in	15
a	15
thicket,	15
and	15
there,	15
my	15
master	15
leaning	15
on	15
his	15
lance,	15
and	15
I	15
seated	15
on	15
my	15
Dapple,	15
battered	15
and	15
weary	15
with	15
the	15
late	15
frays	15
we	15
fell	15
asleep	15
as	15
if	15
it	15
had	15
been	15
on	15
four	15
feather	15
mattresses;	15
and	15
I	15
in	15
particular	15
slept	15
so	15
sound,	15
that,	15
whoever	15
he	15
was,	15
he	15
was	15
able	15
to	15
come	15
and	15
prop	15
me	15
up	15
on	15
four	15
stakes,	15
which	15
he	15
put	15
under	15
the	15
four	15
corners	15
of	15
the	15
pack-saddle	15
in	15
such	15
a	15
way	15
that	15
he	15
left	15
me	15
mounted	15
on	15
it,	15
and	15
took	15
away	15
Dapple	15
from	15
under	15
me	15
without	15
my	15
feeling	15
it.”	15

“That	15
is	15
an	15
easy	15
matter,”	15
said	15
Don	15
Quixote,	15
“and	15
it	15
is	15
no	15
new	15
occurrence,	15
for	15
the	15
same	15
thing	15
happened	15
to	15
Sacripante	15
at	15
the	15
siege	15
of	15
Albracca;	15
the	15
famous	15
thief,	15
Brunello,	15
by	15
the	15
same	15
contrivance,	15
took	15
his	15
horse	15
from	15
between	15
his	15
legs.”	15
“Day	15
came,”	15
continued	15
Sancho,	15
“and	15
the	15
moment	15
I	15
stirred	15
the	15
stakes	15
gave	15
way	15
and	15
I	15
fell	15
to	15
the	15
ground	15
with	15
a	15
mighty	15
come	15
down;	15
I	15
looked	15
about	15
for	15
the	15
ass,	15
but	15
could	15
not	15
see	15
him;	15
the	15
tears	15
rushed	15
to	15
my	15
eyes	15
and	15
I	15
raised	15
such	15
a	15
lamentation	15
that,	15
if	15
the	15
author	15
of	15
our	15
history	15
has	15
not	15
put	15
it	15
in,	15
he	15
may	15
depend	15
upon	15
it	15
he	15
has	15
left	15
out	15
a	15
good	15
thing.	15
Some	15
days	15
after,	15
I	15
know	15
not	15
how	15
many,	15
travelling	15
with	15
her	15
ladyship	15
the	15
Princess	15
Micomicona,	15
I	15
saw	15
my	15
ass,	15
and	15
mounted	15
upon	15
him,	15
in	15
the	15
dress	15
of	15
a	15
gipsy,	15
was	15
that	15
Gines	15
de	15
Pasamonte,	15
the	15
great	15
rogue	15
and	15
rascal	15
that	15
my	15
master	15
and	15
I	15
freed	15
from	15
the	15
chain.”	15
“That	15
is	15
not	15
where	15
the	15
mistake	15
is,”	15
replied	15
Samson;	15
“it	15
is,	15
that	15
before	15
the	15
ass	15
has	15
turned	15
up,	15
the	15
author	15
speaks	15
of	15
Sancho	15
as	15
being	15
mounted	15
on	15
it.”	15
“I	15
don’t	15
know	15
what	15
to	15
say	15
to	15
that,”	15
said	15
Sancho,	15
“unless	15
that	15
the	15
historian	15
made	15
a	15
mistake,	15
or	15
perhaps	15
it	15
might	15
be	15
a	15
blunder	15
of	15
the	15
printer’s.”	15
“No	15
doubt	15
that’s	15
it,”	15
said	15
Samson;	15
“but	15
what	15
became	15
of	15
the	15
hundred	15
crowns?	15
Did	15
they	15
vanish?”	15
To	15
which	15
Sancho	15
answered,	15
“I	15
spent	15
them	15
for	15
my	15
own	15
good,	15
and	15
my	15
wife’s,	15
and	15
my	15
children’s,	15
and	15
it	15
is	15
they	15
that	15
have	15
made	15
my	15
wife	15
bear	15
so	15
patiently	15
all	15
my	15
wanderings	15
on	15
highways	15
and	15
byways,	15
in	15
the	15
service	15
of	15
my	15
master,	15
Don	15
Quixote;	15
for	15
if	15
after	15
all	15
this	15
time	15
I	15
had	15
come	15
back	15
to	15
the	15
house	15
without	15
a	15
rap	15
and	15
without	15
the	15
ass,	15
it	15
would	15
have	15
been	15
a	15
poor	15
look-out	15
for	15
me;	15
and	15
if	15
anyone	15
wants	15
to	15
know	15
anything	15
more	15
about	15
me,	15
here	15
I	15
am,	15
ready	15
to	15
answer	15
the	15
king	15
himself	15
in	15
person;	15
and	15
it	15
is	15
no	15
affair	15
of	15
anyone’s	15
whether	15
I	15
took	15
or	15
did	15
not	15
take,	15
whether	15
I	15
spent	15
or	15
did	15
not	15
spend;	15
for	15
the	15
whacks	15
that	15
were	15
given	15
me	15
in	15
these	15
journeys	15
were	15
to	15
be	15
paid	15
for	15
in	15
money,	15
even	15
if	15
they	15
were	15
valued	15
at	15
no	15
more	15
than	15
four	15
maravedis	15
apiece,	15
another	15
hundred	15
crowns	15
would	15
not	15
pay	15
me	15
for	15
half	15
of	15
them.	15
Let	15
each	15
look	15
to	15
himself	15
and	15
not	15
try	15
to	15
make	15
out	15
white	15
black,	15
and	15
black	15
white;	15
for	15
each	15
of	15
us	15
is	15
as	15
God	15
made	15
him,	15
aye,	15
and	15
often	15
worse.”	15
“I	15
will	15
take	15
care,”	15
said	15
Carrasco,	15
“to	15
impress	15
upon	15
the	15
author	15
of	15
the	15
history	15
that,	15
if	15
he	15
prints	15
it	15
again,	15
he	15
must	15
not	15
forget	15
what	15
worthy	15
Sancho	15
has	15
said,	15
for	15
it	15
will	15
raise	15
it	15
a	15
good	15
span	15
higher.”	15
“Is	15
there	15
anything	15
else	15
to	15
correct	15
in	15
the	15
history,	15
señor	15
bachelor?”	15
asked	15
Don	15
Quixote.	15
“No	15
doubt	15
there	15
is,”	15
replied	15
he;	15
“but	15
not	15
anything	15
that	15
will	15
be	15
of	15
the	15
same	15
importance	15
as	15
those	15
I	15
have	15
mentioned.”	15
“Does	15
the	15
author	15
promise	15
a	15
second	15
part	15
at	15
all?”	15
said	15
Don	15
Quixote.	15
“He	15
does	15
promise	15
one,”	15
replied	15
Samson;	15
“but	15
he	15
says	15
he	15
has	15
not	15
found	15
it,	15
nor	15
does	15
he	15
know	15
who	15
has	15
got	15
it;	15
and	15
we	15
cannot	15
say	15
whether	15
it	15
will	15
appear	15
or	15
not;	15
and	15
so,	15
on	15
that	15
head,	15
as	15
some	15
say	15
that	15
no	15
second	15
part	15
has	15
ever	15
been	15
good,	15
and	15
others	15
that	15
enough	15
has	15
been	15
already	15
written	15
about	15
Don	15
Quixote,	15
it	15
is	15
thought	15
there	15
will	15
be	15
no	15
second	15
part;	15
though	15
some,	15
who	15
are	15
jovial	15
rather	15
than	15
saturnine,	15
say,	15
‘Let	15
us	15
have	15
more	15
Quixotades,	15
let	15
Don	15
Quixote	15
charge	15
and	15
Sancho	15
chatter,	15
and	15
no	15
matter	15
what	15
it	15
may	15
turn	15
out,	15
we	15
shall	15
be	15
satisfied	15
with	15
that.’”	15
“And	15
what	15
does	15
the	15
author	15
mean	15
to	15
do?”	15
said	15
Don	15
Quixote.	15
“What?”	15
replied	15
Samson;	15
“why,	15
as	15
soon	15
as	15
he	15
has	15
found	15
the	15
history	15
which	15
he	15
is	15
now	15
searching	15
for	15
with	15
extraordinary	15
diligence,	15
he	15
will	15
at	15
once	15
give	15
it	15
to	15
the	15
press,	15
moved	15
more	15
by	15
the	15
profit	15
that	15
may	15
accrue	15
to	15
him	15
from	15
doing	15
so	15
than	15
by	15
any	15
thought	15
of	15
praise.”	15
Whereat	15
Sancho	15
observed,	15
“The	15
author	15
looks	15
for	15
money	15
and	15
profit,	15
does	15
he?	15
It	15
will	15
be	15
a	15
wonder	15
if	15
he	15
succeeds,	15
for	15
it	15
will	15
be	15
only	15
hurry,	16
with	16
him,	16
like	16
the	16
tailor	16
on	16
Easter	16
Eve;	16
and	16
works	16
done	16
in	16
a	16
hurry	16
are	16
never	16
finished	16
as	16
perfectly	16
as	16
they	16
ought	16
to	16
be.	16
Let	16
master	16
Moor,	16
or	16
whatever	16
he	16
is,	16
pay	16
attention	16
to	16
what	16
he	16
is	16
doing,	16
and	16
I	16
and	16
my	16
master	16
will	16
give	16
him	16
as	16
much	16
grouting	16
ready	16
to	16
his	16
hand,	16
in	16
the	16
way	16
of	16
adventures	16
and	16
accidents	16
of	16
all	16
sorts,	16
as	16
would	16
make	16
up	16
not	16
only	16
one	16
second	16
part,	16
but	16
a	16
hundred.	16
The	16
good	16
man	16
fancies,	16
no	16
doubt,	16
that	16
we	16
are	16
fast	16
asleep	16
in	16
the	16
straw	16
here,	16
but	16
let	16
him	16
hold	16
up	16
our	16
feet	16
to	16
be	16
shod	16
and	16
he	16
will	16
see	16
which	16
foot	16
it	16
is	16
we	16
go	16
lame	16
on.	16
All	16
I	16
say	16
is,	16
that	16
if	16
my	16
master	16
would	16
take	16
my	16
advice,	16
we	16
would	16
be	16
now	16
afield,	16
redressing	16
outrages	16
and	16
righting	16
wrongs,	16
as	16
is	16
the	16
use	16
and	16
custom	16
of	16
good	16
knights-errant.”	16
Sancho	16
had	16
hardly	16
uttered	16
these	16
words	16
when	16
the	16
neighing	16
of	16
Rocinante	16
fell	16
upon	16
their	16
ears,	16
which	16
neighing	16
Don	16
Quixote	16
accepted	16
as	16
a	16
happy	16
omen,	16
and	16
he	16
resolved	16
to	16
make	16
another	16
sally	16
in	16
three	16
or	16
four	16
days	16
from	16
that	16
time.	16
Announcing	16
his	16
intention	16
to	16
the	16
bachelor,	16
he	16
asked	16
his	16
advice	16
as	16
to	16
the	16
quarter	16
in	16
which	16
he	16
ought	16
to	16
commence	16
his	16
expedition,	16
and	16
the	16
bachelor	16
replied	16
that	16
in	16
his	16
opinion	16
he	16
ought	16
to	16
go	16
to	16
the	16
kingdom	16
of	16
Aragon,	16
and	16
the	16
city	16
of	16
Saragossa,	16
where	16
there	16
were	16
to	16
be	16
certain	16
solemn	16
joustings	16
at	16
the	16
festival	16
of	16
St.	16
George,	16
at	16
which	16
he	16
might	16
win	16
renown	16
above	16
all	16
the	16
knights	16
of	16
Aragon,	16
which	16
would	16
be	16
winning	16
it	16
above	16
all	16
the	16
knights	16
of	16
the	16
world.	16
He	16
commended	16
his	16
very	16
praiseworthy	16
and	16
gallant	16
resolution,	16
but	16
admonished	16
him	16
to	16
proceed	16
with	16
greater	16
caution	16
in	16
encountering	16
dangers,	16
because	16
his	16
life	16
did	16
not	16
belong	16
to	16
him,	16
but	16
to	16
all	16
those	16
who	16
had	16
need	16
of	16
him	16
to	16
protect	16
and	16
aid	16
them	16
in	16
their	16
misfortunes.	16
“There’s	16
where	16
it	16
is,	16
what	16
I	16
abominate,	16
Señor	16
Samson,”	16
said	16
Sancho	16
here;	16
“my	16
master	16
will	16
attack	16
a	16
hundred	16
armed	16
men	16
as	16
a	16
greedy	16
boy	16
would	16
half	16
a	16
dozen	16
melons.	16
Body	16
of	16
the	16
world,	16
señor	16
bachelor!	16
there	16
is	16
a	16
time	16
to	16
attack	16
and	16
a	16
time	16
to	16
retreat,	16
and	16
it	16
is	16
not	16
to	16
be	16
always	16
‘Santiago,	16
and	16
close	16
Spain!’	16
Moreover,	16
I	16
have	16
heard	16
it	16
said	16
(and	16
I	16
think	16
by	16
my	16
master	16
himself,	16
if	16
I	16
remember	16
rightly)	16
that	16
the	16
mean	16
of	16
valour	16
lies	16
between	16
the	16
extremes	16
of	16
cowardice	16
and	16
rashness;	16
and	16
if	16
that	16
be	16
so,	16
I	16
don’t	16
want	16
him	16
to	16
fly	16
without	16
having	16
good	16
reason,	16
or	16
to	16
attack	16
when	16
the	16
odds	16
make	16
it	16
better	16
not.	16
But,	16
above	16
all	16
things,	16
I	16
warn	16
my	16
master	16
that	16
if	16
he	16
is	16
to	16
take	16
me	16
with	16
him	16
it	16
must	16
be	16
on	16
the	16
condition	16
that	16
he	16
is	16
to	16
do	16
all	16
the	16
fighting,	16
and	16
that	16
I	16
am	16
not	16
to	16
be	16
called	16
upon	16
to	16
do	16
anything	16
except	16
what	16
concerns	16
keeping	16
him	16
clean	16
and	16
comfortable;	16
in	16
this	16
I	16
will	16
dance	16
attendance	16
on	16
him	16
readily;	16
but	16
to	16
expect	16
me	16
to	16
draw	16
sword,	16
even	16
against	16
rascally	16
churls	16
of	16
the	16
hatchet	16
and	16
hood,	16
is	16
idle.	16
I	16
don’t	16
set	16
up	16
to	16
be	16
a	16
fighting	16
man,	16
Señor	16
Samson,	16
but	16
only	16
the	16
best	16
and	16
most	16
loyal	16
squire	16
that	16
ever	16
served	16
knight-errant;	16
and	16
if	16
my	16
master	16
Don	16
Quixote,	16
in	16
consideration	16
of	16
my	16
many	16
faithful	16
services,	16
is	16
pleased	16
to	16
give	16
me	16
some	16
island	16
of	16
the	16
many	16
his	16
worship	16
says	16
one	16
may	16
stumble	16
on	16
in	16
these	16
parts,	16
I	16
will	16
take	16
it	16
as	16
a	16
great	16
favour;	16
and	16
if	16
he	16
does	16
not	16
give	16
it	16
to	16
me,	16
I	16
was	16
born	16
like	16
everyone	16
else,	16
and	16
a	16
man	16
must	16
not	16
live	16
in	16
dependence	16
on	16
anyone	16
except	16
God;	16
and	16
what	16
is	16
more,	16
my	16
bread	16
will	16
taste	16
as	16
well,	16
and	16
perhaps	16
even	16
better,	16
without	16
a	16
government	16
than	16
if	16
I	16
were	16
a	16
governor;	16
and	16
how	16
do	16
I	16
know	16
but	16
that	16
in	16
these	16
governments	16
the	16
devil	16
may	16
have	16
prepared	16
some	16
trip	16
for	16
me,	16
to	16
make	16
me	16
lose	16
my	16
footing	16
and	16
fall	16
and	16
knock	16
my	16
grinders	16
out?	16
Sancho	16
I	16
was	16
born	16
and	16
Sancho	16
I	16
mean	16
to	16
die.	16
But	16
for	16
all	16
that,	16
if	16
heaven	16
were	16
to	16
make	16
me	16
a	16
fair	16
offer	16
of	16
an	16
island	16
or	16
something	16
else	16
of	16
the	16
kind,	16
without	16
much	16
trouble	16
and	16
without	16
much	16
risk,	16
I	16
am	16
not	16
such	16
a	16
fool	16
as	16
to	16
refuse	16
it;	16
for	16
they	16
say,	16
too,	16
‘when	16
they	16
offer	16
thee	16
a	16
heifer,	16
run	16
with	16
a	16
halter;	16
and	16
‘when	16
good	16
luck	16
comes	16
to	16
thee,	16
take	16
it	16
in.’”	16
“Brother	16
Sancho,”	16
said	16
Carrasco,	16
“you	16
have	16
spoken	16
like	16
a	16
professor;	16
but,	16
for	16
all	16
that,	16
put	16
your	16
trust	16
in	16
God	16
and	16
in	16
Señor	16
Don	16
Quixote,	16
for	16
he	16
will	16
give	16
you	16
a	16
kingdom,	16
not	16
to	16
say	16
an	16
island.”	16
“It	16
is	16
all	16
the	16
same,	16
be	16
it	16
more	16
or	16
be	16
it	16
less,”	16
replied	16
Sancho;	16
“though	16
I	16
can	16
tell	16
Señor	16
Carrasco	16
that	16
my	16
master	16
would	16
not	16
throw	16
the	16
kingdom	16
he	16
might	16
give	16
me	16
into	16
a	16
sack	16
all	16
in	16
holes;	16
for	16
I	16
have	16
felt	16
my	16
own	16
pulse	16
and	16
I	16
find	16
myself	16
sound	16
enough	16
to	16
rule	16
kingdoms	16
and	16
govern	16
islands;	16
and	16
I	16
have	16
before	16
now	16
told	16
my	16
master	16
as	16
much.”	16
“Take	16
care,	16
Sancho,”	16
said	16
Samson;	16
“honours	16
change	16
manners,	16
and	16
perhaps	16
when	16
you	16
find	16
yourself	16
a	16
governor	16
you	16
won’t	16
know	16
the	16
mother	16
that	16
bore	16
you.”	16
“That	16
may	16
hold	16
good	16
of	16
those	16
that	16
are	16
born	16
in	16
the	16
ditches,”	16
said	16
Sancho,	16
“not	16
of	16
those	16
who	16
have	16
the	16
fat	16
of	16
an	16
old	16
Christian	16
four	16
fingers	16
deep	16
on	16
their	16
souls,	16
as	16
I	16
have.	16
Nay,	16
only	16
look	16
at	16
my	16
disposition,	16
is	16
that	16
likely	16
to	16
show	16
ingratitude	16
to	16
anyone?”	16
“God	16
grant	16
it,”	16
said	16
Don	16
Quixote;	16
“we	16
shall	16
see	16
when	16
the	16
government	16
comes;	16
and	16
I	16
seem	16
to	16
see	16
it	16
already.”	16
He	16
then	16
begged	16
the	16
bachelor,	16
if	16
he	16
were	16
a	16
poet,	16
to	16
do	16
him	16
the	16
favour	16
of	16
composing	16
some	16
verses	16
for	16
him	16
conveying	16
the	16
farewell	16
he	16
meant	16
to	16
take	16
of	16
his	16
lady	16
Dulcinea	16
del	16
Toboso,	16
and	16
to	16
see	16
that	16
a	16
letter	16
of	16
her	16
name	16
was	16
placed	16
at	16
the	16
beginning	16
of	16
each	16
line,	16
so	16
that,	16
at	16
the	16
end	16
of	16
the	16
verses,	16
“Dulcinea	16
del	16
Toboso”	16
might	16
be	16
read	16
by	16
putting	16
together	16
the	16
first	16
letters.	16
The	16
bachelor	16
replied	16
that	16
although	16
he	16
was	16
not	16
one	16
of	16
the	16
famous	16
poets	16
of	16
Spain,	16
who	16
were,	16
they	16
said,	16
only	16
three	16
and	16
a	16
half,	16
he	16
would	16
not	16
fail	16
to	16
compose	16
the	16
required	16
verses;	16
though	16
he	16
saw	16
a	16
great	16
difficulty	16
in	16
the	16
task,	16
as	16
the	16
letters	16
which	16
made	16
up	16
the	16
name	16
were	16
seventeen;	16
so,	16
if	16
he	16
made	16
four	16
ballad	16
stanzas	16
of	16
four	16
lines	16
each,	16
there	16
would	16
be	16
a	16
letter	16
over,	16
and	16
if	16
he	16
made	16
them	16
of	16
five,	16
what	16
they	16
called	16
decimas	16
or	16
redondillas,	16
there	16
were	16
three	16
letters	16
short;	16
nevertheless	16
he	16
would	16
try	16
to	16
drop	16
a	16
letter	16
as	16
well	16
as	16
he	16
could,	16
so	16
that	16
the	16
name	16
“Dulcinea	16
del	16
Toboso”	16
might	16
be	16
got	16
into	16
four	16
ballad	16
stanzas.	16
“It	16
must	16
be,	16
by	16
some	16
means	16
or	16
other,”	16
said	16
Don	16
Quixote,	16
“for	16
unless	16
the	16
name	16
stands	16
there	16
plain	16
and	16
manifest,	16
no	16
woman	16
would	16
believe	16
the	16
verses	16
were	16
made	16
for	16
her.”	16
They	16
agreed	16
upon	16
this,	16
and	16
that	16
the	16
departure	16
should	16
take	16
place	16
in	16
three	16
days	16
from	16
that	16
time.	16
Don	16
Quixote	16
charged	16
the	16
bachelor	16
to	16
keep	16
it	16
a	16
secret,	16
especially	16
from	16
the	16
curate	16
and	16
Master	16
Nicholas,	16
and	16
from	16
his	16
niece	16
and	16
the	16
housekeeper,	16
lest	16
they	16
should	16
prevent	16
the	16
execution	16
of	16
his	16
praiseworthy	16
and	16
valiant	16
purpose.	16
Carrasco	16
promised	16
all,	16
and	16
then	16
took	16
his	16
leave,	16
charging	16
Don	16
Quixote	16
to	16
inform	16
him	16
of	16
his	16
good	16
or	16
evil	16
fortunes	16
whenever	16
he	16
had	16
an	16
opportunity;	16
and	16
thus	16
they	16
bade	16
each	16
other	16
farewell,	16
and	16
Sancho	16
went	16
away	16
to	16
make	16
the	16
necessary	16
preparations	16
for	16
their	16
expedition.	16

The	16
translator	16
of	16
this	16
history,	16
when	16
he	16
comes	16
to	16
write	16
this	16
fifth	16
chapter,	16
says	16
that	16
he	16
considers	16
it	16
apocryphal,	16
because	16
in	16
it	16
Sancho	16
Panza	16
speaks	16
in	16
a	16
style	16
unlike	16
that	16
which	16
might	16
have	16
been	16
expected	16
from	16
his	16
limited	16
intelligence,	16
and	16
says	16
things	16
so	16
subtle	16
that	16
he	16
does	16
not	16
think	16
it	16
possible	16
he	16
could	16
have	16
conceived	16
them;	16
however,	16
desirous	16
of	16
doing	16
what	16
his	16
task	16
imposed	16
upon	16
him,	16
he	16
was	16
unwilling	16
to	16
leave	16
it	16
untranslated,	16
and	16
therefore	16
he	16
went	16
on	16
to	16
say:	16
Sancho	16
came	16
home	16
in	16
such	16
glee	16
and	16
spirits	16
that	16
his	16
wife	16
noticed	16
his	16
happiness	16
a	16
bowshot	16
off,	16
so	16
much	16
so	16
that	16
it	16
made	16
her	16
ask	16
him,	16
“What	16
have	16
you	16
got,	16
Sancho	16
friend,	16
that	16
you	16
are	16
so	16
glad?”	16
To	16
which	16
he	16
replied,	16
“Wife,	16
if	16
it	16
were	16
God’s	16
will,	16
I	16
should	16
be	16
very	16
glad	16
not	16
to	16
be	16
so	16
well	16
pleased	16
as	16
I	16
show	16
myself.”	16
“I	16
don’t	16
understand	16
you,	16
husband,”	16
said	16
she,	16
“and	16
I	16
don’t	16
know	16
what	16
you	16
mean	16
by	16
saying	16
you	16
would	16
be	16
glad,	16
if	16
it	16
were	16
God’s	16
will,	16
not	16
to	16
be	16
well	16
pleased;	16
for,	16
fool	16
as	16
I	16
am,	16
I	16
don’t	16
know	16
how	16
one	16
can	16
find	16
pleasure	16
in	16
not	16
having	16
it.”	16
“Hark	16
ye,	16
Teresa,”	16
replied	16
Sancho,	16
“I	16
am	16
glad	16
because	16
I	16
have	16
made	16
up	16
my	16
mind	16
to	16
go	16
back	16
to	16
the	16
service	16
of	16
my	16
master	16
Don	16
Quixote,	16
who	16
means	16
to	16
go	16
out	16
a	16
third	16
time	16
to	16
seek	16
for	16
adventures;	16
and	16
I	16
am	16
going	16
with	16
him	16
again,	16
for	16
my	16
necessities	16
will	16
have	16
it	16
so,	16
and	16
also	16
the	16
hope	16
that	16
cheers	16
me	16
with	16
the	16
thought	16
that	16
I	16
may	16
find	16
another	16
hundred	16
crowns	16
like	16
those	16
we	16
have	16
spent;	16
though	16
it	16
makes	16
me	16
sad	16
to	16
have	16
to	16
leave	16
thee	16
and	16
the	16
children;	16
and	16
if	16
God	16
would	16
be	16
pleased	16
to	16
let	16
me	16
have	16
my	16
daily	16
bread,	16
dry-shod	16
and	16
at	16
home,	16
without	16
taking	16
me	16
out	16
into	16
the	16
byways	16
and	16
cross-roads—and	16
he	16
could	16
do	16
it	16
at	16
small	16
cost	16
by	16
merely	16
willing	16
it—it	16
is	16
clear	16
my	16
happiness	16
would	16
be	16
more	16
solid	16
and	16
lasting,	16
for	16
the	16
happiness	16
I	16
have	16
is	16
mingled	16
with	16
sorrow	16
at	16
leaving	16
thee;	16
so	16
that	16
I	16
was	16
right	16
in	16
saying	16
I	16
would	16
be	16
glad,	16
if	16
it	16
were	16
God’s	16
will,	16
not	16
to	16
be	16
well	16
pleased.”	16
“Look	16
here,	16
Sancho,”	16
said	16
Teresa;	16
“ever	16
since	16
you	16
joined	16
on	16
to	16
a	16
knight-errant	16
you	16
talk	16
in	16
such	16
a	16
roundabout	16
way	16
that	16
there	16
is	16
no	16
understanding	16
you.”	16
“It	16
is	16
enough	16
that	16
God	16
understands	16
me,	16
wife,”	16
replied	16
Sancho;	16
“for	16
he	16
is	16
the	16
understander	16
of	16
all	16
things;	16
that	16
will	16
do;	16
but	16
mind,	16
sister,	16
you	16
must	16
look	16
to	16
Dapple	16
carefully	16
for	16
the	16
next	16
three	16
days,	16
so	16
that	16
he	16
may	16
be	16
fit	16
to	16
take	16
arms;	16
double	16
his	16
feed,	16
and	16
see	16
to	16
the	16
pack-saddle	16
and	16
other	16
harness,	16
for	16
it	16
is	16
not	16
to	16
a	16
wedding	16
we	16
are	16
bound,	16
but	16
to	16
go	16
round	16
the	16
world,	16
and	16
play	16
at	16
give	16
and	16
take	16
with	16
giants	16
and	16
dragons	16
and	16
monsters,	16
and	16
hear	16
hissings	16
and	16
roarings	16
and	16
bellowings	16
and	16
howlings;	16
and	16
even	16
all	16
this	16
would	16
be	16
lavender,	16
if	16
we	16
had	16
not	16
to	16
reckon	16
with	16
Yanguesans	16
and	16
enchanted	16
Moors.”	16
“I	16
know	16
well	16
enough,	16
husband,”	16
said	16
Teresa,	16
“that	16
squires-errant	16
don’t	16
eat	16
their	16
bread	16
for	16
nothing,	16
and	16
so	16
I	16
will	16
be	16
always	16
praying	16
to	16
our	16
Lord	16
to	16
deliver	16
you	16
speedily	16
from	16
all	16
that	16
hard	16
fortune.”	16
“I	16
can	16
tell	16
you,	16
wife,”	16
said	16
Sancho,	16
“if	16
I	16
did	16
not	16
expect	16
to	16
see	16
myself	16
governor	16
of	16
an	16
island	16
before	16
long,	16
I	16
would	16
drop	16
down	16
dead	16
on	16
the	16
spot.”	16
“Nay,	16
then,	16
husband,”	16
said	16
Teresa;	16
“let	16
the	16
hen	16
live,	16
though	16
it	16
be	16
with	16
her	16
pip,	16
live,	16
and	16
let	16
the	16
devil	16
take	16
all	16
the	16
governments	16
in	16
the	16
world;	16
you	16
came	16
out	16
of	16
your	16
mother’s	16
womb	16
without	16
a	16
government,	16
you	16
have	16
lived	16
until	16
now	16
without	16
a	16
government,	16
and	16
when	16
it	16
is	16
God’s	16
will	16
you	16
will	16
go,	16
or	16
be	16
carried,	16
to	16
your	16
grave	16
without	16
a	16
government.	16
How	16
many	16
there	16
are	16
in	16
the	16
world	16
who	16
live	16
without	16
a	16
government,	16
and	16
continue	16
to	16
live	16
all	16
the	16
same,	16
and	16
are	16
reckoned	16
in	16
the	16
number	16
of	16
the	16
people.	16
The	16
best	16
sauce	16
in	16
the	16
world	16
is	16
hunger,	16
and	16
as	16
the	16
poor	16
are	16
never	16
without	16
that,	16
they	16
always	16
eat	16
with	16
a	16
relish.	16
But	16
mind,	16
Sancho,	16
if	16
by	16
good	16
luck	16
you	16
should	16
find	16
yourself	16
with	16
some	16
government,	16
don’t	16
forget	16
me	16
and	16
your	16
children.	16
Remember	16
that	16
Sanchico	16
is	16
now	16
full	16
fifteen,	16
and	16
it	16
is	16
right	16
he	16
should	16
go	16
to	16
school,	16
if	16
his	16
uncle	16
the	16
abbot	16
has	16
a	16
mind	16
to	16
have	16
him	16
trained	16
for	16
the	16
Church.	16
Consider,	16
too,	16
that	16
your	16
daughter	16
Mari-Sancha	16
will	16
not	16
die	16
of	16
grief	16
if	16
we	16
marry	16
her;	16
for	16
I	16
have	16
my	16
suspicions	16
that	16
she	16
is	16
as	16
eager	16
to	16
get	16
a	16
husband	16
as	16
you	16
to	16
get	16
a	16
government;	16
and,	16
after	16
all,	16
a	16
daughter	16
looks	16
better	16
ill	16
married	16
than	16
well	16
whored.”	16
“By	16
my	16
faith,”	16
replied	16
Sancho,	16
“if	16
God	16
brings	16
me	16
to	16
get	16
any	16
sort	16
of	16
a	16
government,	16
I	16
intend,	16
wife,	16
to	16
make	16
such	16
a	16
high	16
match	16
for	16
Mari-Sancha	16
that	16
there	16
will	16
be	16
no	16
approaching	16
her	16
without	16
calling	16
her	16
‘my	16
lady.”	16
“Nay,	16
Sancho,”	16
returned	16
Teresa;	16
“marry	16
her	16
to	16
her	16
equal,	16
that	16
is	16
the	16
safest	16
plan;	16
for	16
if	16
you	16
put	16
her	16
out	16
of	16
wooden	16
clogs	16
into	16
high-heeled	16
shoes,	16
out	16
of	16
her	16
grey	16
flannel	16
petticoat	16
into	16
hoops	16
and	16
silk	16
gowns,	16
out	16
of	16
the	16
plain	16
‘Marica’	16
and	16
‘thou,’	16
into	16
‘Doña	16
So-and-so’	16
and	16
‘my	16
lady,’	16
the	16
girl	16
won’t	16
know	16
where	16
she	16
is,	16
and	16
at	16
every	16
turn	16
she	16
will	16
fall	16
into	16
a	16
thousand	16
blunders	16
that	16
will	16
show	16
the	16
thread	16
of	16
her	16
coarse	16
homespun	16
stuff.”	16
“Tut,	16
you	16
fool,”	16
said	16
Sancho;	16
“it	16
will	16
be	16
only	16
to	16
practise	16
it	16
for	16
two	16
or	16
three	16
years;	16
and	16
then	16
dignity	16
and	16
decorum	16
will	16
fit	16
her	16
as	16
easily	16
as	16
a	16
glove;	16
and	16
if	16
not,	16
what	16
matter?	16
Let	16
her	16
be	16
‘my	16
lady,’	16
and	16
never	16
mind	16
what	16
happens.”	16
“Keep	16
to	16
your	16
own	16
station,	16
Sancho,”	16
replied	16
Teresa;	16
“don’t	16
try	16
to	16
raise	16
yourself	16
higher,	16
and	16
bear	16
in	16
mind	16
the	16
proverb	16
that	16
says,	16
‘wipe	16
the	16
nose	16
of	16
your	16
neigbbour’s	16
son,	16
and	16
take	16
him	16
into	16
your	16
house.’	16
A	16
fine	16
thing	16
it	16
would	16
be,	16
indeed,	16
to	16
marry	16
our	16
Maria	16
to	16
some	16
great	16
count	16
or	16
grand	16
gentleman,	16
who,	16
when	16
the	16
humour	16
took	16
him,	16
would	16
abuse	16
her	16
and	16
call	16
her	16
clown-bred	16
and	16
clodhopper’s	16
daughter	16
and	16
spinning	16
wench.	16
I	16
have	16
not	16
been	16
bringing	16
up	16
my	16
daughter	16
for	16
that	16
all	16
this	16
time,	16
I	16
can	16
tell	16
you,	16
husband.	16
Do	16
you	16
bring	16
home	16
money,	16
Sancho,	16
and	16
leave	16
marrying	16
her	16
to	16
my	16
care;	16
there	16
is	16
Lope	16
Tocho,	16
Juan	16
Tocho’s	16
son,	16
a	16
stout,	16
sturdy	16
young	16
fellow	16
that	16
we	16
know,	16
and	16
I	16
can	16
see	16
he	16
does	16
not	16
look	16
sour	16
at	16
the	16
girl;	16
and	16
with	16
him,	16
one	16
of	16
our	16
own	16
sort,	16
she	16
will	16
be	16
well	16
married,	16
and	16
we	16
shall	16
have	16
her	16
always	16
under	16
our	16
eyes,	16
and	16
be	16
all	16
one	16
family,	16
parents	16
and	16
children,	16
grandchildren	16
and	16
sons-in-law,	16
and	16
the	16
peace	16
and	16
blessing	16
of	16
God	16
will	16
dwell	16
among	16
us;	16
so	16
don’t	16
you	16
go	16
marrying	16
her	16
in	16
those	16
courts	16
and	16
grand	16
palaces	16
where	16
they	16
won’t	16
know	16
what	16
to	16
make	16
of	16
her,	16
or	16
she	16
what	16
to	16
make	16
of	16
herself.”	16
“Why,	16
you	16
idiot	16
and	16
wife	16
for	16
Barabbas,”	16
said	16
Sancho,	16
“what	16
do	16
you	16
mean	16
by	16
trying,	16
without	16
why	16
or	16
wherefore,	16
to	16
keep	16
me	16
from	16
marrying	16
my	16
daughter	16
to	16
one	16
who	16
will	16
give	16
me	16
grandchildren	16
that	16
will	16
be	16
called	16
‘your	16
lordship’?	16
Look	16
ye,	16
Teresa,	16
I	16
have	16
always	16
heard	16
my	16
elders	16
say	16
that	16
he	16
who	16
does	16
not	16
know	16
how	16
to	16
take	16
advantage	16
of	16
luck	16
when	16
it	16
comes	16
to	16
him,	16
has	16
no	16
right	16
to	16
complain	16
if	16
it	16
gives	16
him	16
the	16
go-by;	16
and	16
now	16
that	16
it	16
is	16
knocking	16
at	16
our	16
door,	16
it	16
will	16
not	16
do	16
to	16
shut	16
it	16
out;	16
let	16
us	16
go	16
with	16
the	16
favouring	16
breeze	16
that	16
blows	16
upon	16
us.”	16
It	16
is	16
this	16
sort	16
of	16
talk,	16
and	16
what	16
Sancho	16
says	16
lower	16
down,	16
that	16
made	16
the	16
translator	16
of	16
the	16
history	16
say	16
he	16
considered	16
this	16
chapter	16
apocryphal.	16
“Don’t	16
you	16
see,	16
you	16
animal,”	16
continued	16
Sancho,	16
“that	16
it	16
will	16
be	16
well	16
for	16
me	16
to	16
drop	16
into	16
some	16
profitable	16
government	16
that	16
will	16
lift	16
us	16
out	16
of	16
the	16
mire,	16
and	16
marry	16
Mari-Sancha	16
to	16
whom	16
I	16
like;	16
and	16
you	16
yourself	16
will	16
find	16
yourself	16
called	16
‘Doña	16
Teresa	16
Panza,’	16
and	16
sitting	16
in	16
church	16
on	16
a	16
fine	16
carpet	16
and	16
cushions	16
and	16
draperies,	16
in	16
spite	16
and	16
in	16
defiance	16
of	16
all	16
the	16
born	16
ladies	16
of	16
the	16
town?	16
No,	16
stay	16
as	16
you	16
are,	16
growing	16
neither	16
greater	16
nor	16
less,	16
like	16
a	16
tapestry	16
figure—Let	16
us	16
say	16
no	16
more	16
about	16
it,	16
for	16
Sanchica	16
shall	16
be	16
a	16
countess,	16
say	16
what	16
you	16
will.”	16
“Are	16
you	16
sure	16
of	16
all	16
you	16
say,	16
husband?”	16
replied	16
Teresa.	16
“Well,	16
for	16
all	16
that,	16
I	16
am	16
afraid	16
this	16
rank	16
of	16
countess	16
for	16
my	16
daughter	16
will	16
be	16
her	16
ruin.	16
You	16
do	16
as	16
you	16
like,	16
make	16
a	16
duchess	16
or	16
a	16
princess	16
of	16
her,	16
but	16
I	16
can	16
tell	16
you	16
it	16
will	16
not	16
be	16
with	16
my	16
will	16
and	16
consent.	16
I	16
was	16
always	16
a	16
lover	16
of	16
equality,	16
brother,	16
and	16
I	16
can’t	16
bear	16
to	16
see	16
people	16
give	16
themselves	16
airs	16
without	16
any	16
right.	16
They	16
called	16
me	16
Teresa	16
at	16
my	16
baptism,	16
a	16
plain,	16
simple	16
name,	16
without	16
any	16
additions	16
or	16
tags	16
or	16
fringes	16
of	16
Dons	16
or	16
Doñas;	16
Cascajo	16
was	16
my	16
father’s	16
name,	16
and	16
as	16
I	16
am	16
your	16
wife,	16
I	16
am	16
called	16
Teresa	16
Panza,	16
though	16
by	16
right	16
I	16
ought	16
to	16
be	16
called	16
Teresa	16
Cascajo;	16
but	16
‘kings	16
go	16
where	16
laws	16
like,’	16
and	16
I	16
am	16
content	16
with	16
this	16
name	16
without	16
having	16
the	16
‘Don’	16
put	16
on	16
top	16
of	16
it	16
to	16
make	16
it	16
so	16
heavy	16
that	16
I	16
cannot	16
carry	16
it;	16
and	16
I	16
don’t	16
want	16
to	16
make	16
people	16
talk	16
about	16
me	16
when	16
they	16
see	16
me	16
go	16
dressed	16
like	16
a	16
countess	16
or	16
governor’s	16
wife;	16
for	16
they	16
will	16
say	16
at	16
once,	16
‘See	16
what	16
airs	16
the	16
slut	16
gives	16
herself!	16
Only	16
yesterday	16
she	16
was	16
always	16
spinning	16
flax,	16
and	16
used	16
to	16
go	16
to	16
mass	16
with	16
the	16
tail	16
of	16
her	16
petticoat	16
over	16
her	16
head	16
instead	16
of	16
a	16
mantle,	16
and	16
there	16
she	16
goes	16
to-day	16
in	16
a	16
hooped	16
gown	16
with	16
her	16
broaches	16
and	16
airs,	16
as	16
if	16
we	16
didn’t	16
know	16
her!’	16
If	16
God	16
keeps	16
me	16
in	16
my	16
seven	16
senses,	16
or	16
five,	16
or	16
whatever	16
number	16
I	16
have,	16
I	16
am	16
not	16
going	16
to	16
bring	16
myself	16
to	16
such	16
a	16
pass;	16
go	16
you,	16
brother,	16
and	16
be	16
a	16
government	16
or	16
an	16
island	16
man,	16
and	16
swagger	16
as	16
much	16
as	16
you	16
like;	16
for	16
by	16
the	16
soul	16
of	16
my	16
mother,	16
neither	16
my	16
daughter	16
nor	16
I	16
are	16
going	16
to	16
stir	16
a	16
step	16
from	16
our	16
village;	16
a	16
respectable	16
woman	16
should	16
have	16
a	16
broken	16
leg	16
and	16
keep	16
at	16
home;	16
and	16
to	16
be	16
busy	16
at	16
something	16
is	16
a	16
virtuous	16
damsel’s	16
holiday;	16
be	16
off	16
to	16
your	16
adventures	16
along	16
with	16
your	16
Don	16
Quixote,	16
and	16
leave	16
us	16
to	16
our	16
misadventures,	16
for	16
God	16
will	16
mend	16
them	16
for	16
us	16
according	16
as	16
we	16
deserve	16
it.	16
I	16
don’t	16
know,	16
I’m	16
sure,	16
who	16
fixed	16
the	16
‘Don’	16
to	16
him,	16
what	16
neither	16
his	16
father	16
nor	16
grandfather	16
ever	16
had.”	16
“I	16
declare	16
thou	16
hast	16
a	16
devil	16
of	16
some	16
sort	16
in	16
thy	16
body!”	16
said	16
Sancho.	16
“God	16
help	16
thee,	16
what	16
a	16
lot	16
of	16
things	16
thou	16
hast	16
strung	16
together,	16
one	16
after	16
the	16
other,	16
without	16
head	16
or	16
tail!	16
What	16
have	16
Cascajo,	16
and	16
the	16
broaches	16
and	16
the	16
proverbs	16
and	16
the	16
airs,	16
to	16
do	16
with	16
what	16
I	16
say?	16
Look	16
here,	16
fool	16
and	16
dolt	16
(for	16
so	16
I	16
may	16
call	16
you,	16
when	16
you	16
don’t	16
understand	16
my	16
words,	16
and	16
run	16
away	16
from	16
good	16
fortune),	16
if	16
I	16
had	16
said	16
that	16
my	16
daughter	16
was	16
to	16
throw	16
herself	16
down	16
from	16
a	16
tower,	16
or	16
go	16
roaming	16
the	16
world,	16
as	16
the	16
Infanta	16
Doña	16
Urraca	16
wanted	16
to	16
do,	16
you	16
would	16
be	16
right	16
in	16
not	16
giving	16
way	16
to	16
my	16
will;	16
but	16
if	16
in	16
an	16
instant,	16
in	16
less	16
than	16
the	16
twinkling	16
of	16
an	16
eye,	16
I	16
put	16
the	16
‘Don’	16
and	16
‘my	16
lady’	16
on	16
her	16
back,	16
and	16
take	16
her	16
out	16
of	16
the	16
stubble,	16
and	16
place	16
her	16
under	16
a	16
canopy,	16
on	16
a	16
dais,	16
and	16
on	16
a	16
couch,	16
with	16
more	16
velvet	16
cushions	16
than	16
all	16
the	16
Almohades	16
of	16
Morocco	16
ever	16
had	16
in	16
their	16
family,	16
why	16
won’t	16
you	16
consent	16
and	16
fall	16
in	16
with	16
my	16
wishes?”	16
“Do	16
you	16
know	16
why,	16
husband?”	16
replied	16
Teresa;	16
“because	16
of	16
the	16
proverb	16
that	16
says	16
‘who	16
covers	16
thee,	16
discovers	16
thee.’	16
At	16
the	16
poor	16
man	16
people	16
only	16
throw	16
a	16
hasty	16
glance;	16
on	16
the	16
rich	16
man	16
they	16
fix	16
their	16
eyes;	16
and	16
if	16
the	16
said	16
rich	16
man	16
was	16
once	16
on	16
a	16
time	16
poor,	16
it	16
is	16
then	16
there	16
is	16
the	16
sneering	16
and	16
the	16
tattle	16
and	16
spite	16
of	16
backbiters;	16
and	16
in	16
the	16
streets	16
here	16
they	16
swarm	16
as	16
thick	16
as	16
bees.”	16
“Look	16
here,	16
Teresa,”	16
said	16
Sancho,	16
“and	16
listen	16
to	16
what	16
I	16
am	16
now	16
going	16
to	16
say	16
to	16
you;	16
maybe	16
you	16
never	16
heard	16
it	16
in	16
all	16
your	16
life;	16
and	16
I	16
do	16
not	16
give	16
my	16
own	16
notions,	16
for	16
what	16
I	16
am	16
about	16
to	16
say	16
are	16
the	16
opinions	16
of	16
his	16
reverence	16
the	16
preacher,	16
who	16
preached	16
in	16
this	16
town	16
last	16
Lent,	16
and	16
who	16
said,	16
if	16
I	16
remember	16
rightly,	16
that	16
all	16
things	16
present	16
that	16
our	16
eyes	16
behold,	16
bring	16
themselves	16
before	16
us,	16
and	16
remain	16
and	16
fix	16
themselves	16
on	16
our	16
memory	16
much	16
better	16
and	16
more	16
forcibly	16
than	16
things	16
past.”	16
These	16
observations	16
which	16
Sancho	16
makes	16
here	16
are	16
the	16
other	16
ones	16
on	16
account	16
of	16
which	16
the	16
translator	16
says	16
he	16
regards	16
this	16
chapter	16
as	16
apocryphal,	16
inasmuch	16
as	16
they	16
are	16
beyond	16
Sancho’s	16
capacity.	16
“Whence	16
it	16
arises,”	16
he	16
continued,	16
“that	16
when	16
we	16
see	16
any	16
person	16
well	16
dressed	16
and	16
making	16
a	16
figure	16
with	16
rich	16
garments	16
and	16
retinue	16
of	16
servants,	16
it	16
seems	16
to	16
lead	16
and	16
impel	16
us	16
perforce	16
to	16
respect	16
him,	16
though	16
memory	16
may	16
at	16
the	16
same	16
moment	16
recall	16
to	16
us	16
some	16
lowly	16
condition	16
in	16
which	16
we	16
have	16
seen	16
him,	16
but	16
which,	16
whether	16
it	16
may	16
have	16
been	16
poverty	16
or	16
low	16
birth,	16
being	16
now	16
a	16
thing	16
of	16
the	16
past,	16
has	16
no	16
existence;	16
while	16
the	16
only	16
thing	16
that	16
has	16
any	16
existence	16
is	16
what	16
we	16
see	16
before	16
us;	16
and	16
if	16
this	16
person	16
whom	16
fortune	16
has	16
raised	16
from	16
his	16
original	16
lowly	16
state	16
(these	16
were	16
the	16
very	16
words	16
the	16
padre	16
used)	16
to	16
his	16
present	16
height	16
of	16
prosperity,	16
be	16
well	16
bred,	16
generous,	16
courteous	16
to	16
all,	16
without	16
seeking	16
to	16
vie	16
with	16
those	16
whose	16
nobility	16
is	16
of	16
ancient	16
date,	16
depend	16
upon	16
it,	16
Teresa,	16
no	16
one	16
will	16
remember	16
what	16
he	16
was,	16
and	16
everyone	16
will	16
respect	16
what	16
he	16
is,	16
except	16
indeed	16
the	16
envious,	16
from	16
whom	16
no	16
fair	16
fortune	16
is	16
safe.”	16
“I	16
do	16
not	16
understand	16
you,	16
husband,”	16
replied	16
Teresa;	16
“do	16
as	16
you	16
like,	16
and	16
don’t	16
break	16
my	16
head	16
with	16
any	16
more	16
speechifying	16
and	16
rethoric;	16
and	16
if	16
you	16
have	16
revolved	16
to	16
do	16
what	16
you	16
say—”	16
“Resolved,	16
you	16
should	16
say,	16
woman,”	16
said	16
Sancho,	16
“not	16
revolved.”	16
“Don’t	16
set	16
yourself	16
to	16
wrangle	16
with	16
me,	16
husband,”	16
said	16
Teresa;	16
“I	16
speak	16
as	16
God	16
pleases,	16
and	16
don’t	16
deal	16
in	16
out-of-the-way	16
phrases;	16
and	16
I	16
say	16
if	16
you	16
are	16
bent	16
upon	16
having	16
a	16
government,	16
take	16
your	16
son	16
Sancho	16
with	16
you,	16
and	16
teach	16
him	16
from	16
this	16
time	16
on	16
how	16
to	16
hold	16
a	16
government;	16
for	16
sons	16
ought	16
to	16
inherit	16
and	16
learn	16
the	16
trades	16
of	16
their	16
fathers.”	16
“As	16
soon	16
as	16
I	16
have	16
the	16
government,”	16
said	16
Sancho,	16
“I	16
will	16
send	16
for	16
him	16
by	16
post,	16
and	16
I	16
will	16
send	16
thee	16
money,	16
of	16
which	16
I	16
shall	16
have	16
no	16
lack,	16
for	16
there	16
is	16
never	16
any	16
want	16
of	16
people	16
to	16
lend	16
it	16
to	16
governors	16
when	16
they	16
have	16
not	16
got	16
it;	16
and	16
do	16
thou	16
dress	16
him	16
so	16
as	16
to	16
hide	16
what	16
he	16
is	16
and	16
make	16
him	16
look	16
what	16
he	16
is	16
to	16
be.”	16
“You	16
send	16
the	16
money,”	16
said	16
Teresa,	16
“and	16
I’ll	16
dress	16
him	16
up	16
for	16
you	16
as	16
fine	16
as	16
you	16
please.”	16
“Then	16
we	16
are	16
agreed	16
that	16
our	16
daughter	16
is	16
to	16
be	16
a	16
countess,”	16
said	16
Sancho.	16
“The	16
day	16
that	16
I	16
see	16
her	16
a	16
countess,”	16
replied	16
Teresa,	16
“it	16
will	16
be	16
the	16
same	16
to	16
me	16
as	16
if	16
I	16
was	16
burying	16
her;	16
but	16
once	16
more	16
I	16
say	16
do	16
as	16
you	16
please,	16
for	16
we	16
women	16
are	16
born	16
to	16
this	16
burden	16
of	16
being	16
obedient	16
to	16
our	16
husbands,	16
though	16
they	16
be	16
dogs;”	16
and	16
with	16
this	16
she	16
began	16
to	16
weep	16
in	16
earnest,	16
as	16
if	16
she	16
already	16
saw	16
Sanchica	16
dead	16
and	16
buried.	16
Sancho	16
consoled	16
her	16
by	16
saying	16
that	16
though	16
he	16
must	16
make	16
her	16
a	16
countess,	16
he	16
would	16
put	16
it	16
off	16
as	16
long	16
as	16
possible.	16
Here	16
their	16
conversation	16
came	16
to	16
an	16
end,	16
and	16
Sancho	16
went	16
back	16
to	16
see	16
Don	16
Quixote,	16
and	16
make	16
arrangements	16
for	16
their	16
departure.	16

While	16
Sancho	16
Panza	16
and	16
his	16
wife,	16
Teresa	16
Cascajo,	16
held	16
the	16
above	16
irrelevant	16
conversation,	16
Don	16
Quixote’s	16
niece	16
and	16
housekeeper	16
were	16
not	16
idle,	16
for	16
by	16
a	16
thousand	16
signs	16
they	16
began	16
to	16
perceive	16
that	16
their	16
uncle	16
and	16
master	16
meant	16
to	16
give	16
them	16
the	16
slip	16
the	16
third	16
time,	16
and	16
once	16
more	16
betake	16
himself	16
to	16
his,	16
for	16
them,	16
ill-errant	16
chivalry.	16
They	16
strove	16
by	16
all	16
the	16
means	16
in	16
their	16
power	16
to	16
divert	16
him	16
from	16
such	16
an	16
unlucky	16
scheme;	16
but	16
it	16
was	16
all	16
preaching	16
in	16
the	16
desert	16
and	16
hammering	16
cold	16
iron.	16
Nevertheless,	16
among	16
many	16
other	16
representations	16
made	16
to	16
him,	16
the	16
housekeeper	16
said	16
to	16
him,	16
“In	16
truth,	16
master,	16
if	16
you	16
do	16
not	16
keep	16
still	16
and	16
stay	16
quiet	16
at	16
home,	16
and	16
give	16
over	16
roaming	16
mountains	16
and	16
valleys	16
like	16
a	16
troubled	16
spirit,	16
looking	16
for	16
what	16
they	16
say	16
are	16
called	16
adventures,	16
but	16
what	16
I	16
call	16
misfortunes,	16
I	16
shall	16
have	16
to	16
make	16
complaint	16
to	16
God	16
and	16
the	16
king	16
with	16
loud	16
supplication	16
to	16
send	16
some	16
remedy.”	16
To	16
which	16
Don	16
Quixote	16
replied,	16
“What	16
answer	16
God	16
will	16
give	16
to	16
your	16
complaints,	16
housekeeper,	16
I	16
know	16
not,	16
nor	16
what	16
his	16
Majesty	16
will	16
answer	16
either;	16
I	16
only	16
know	16
that	16
if	16
I	16
were	16
king	16
I	16
should	16
decline	16
to	16
answer	16
the	16
numberless	16
silly	16
petitions	16
they	16
present	16
every	16
day;	16
for	16
one	16
of	16
the	16
greatest	16
among	16
the	16
many	16
troubles	16
kings	16
have	16
is	16
being	16
obliged	16
to	16
listen	16
to	16
all	16
and	16
answer	16
all,	16
and	16
therefore	16
I	16
should	16
be	16
sorry	16
that	16
any	16
affairs	16
of	16
mine	16
should	16
worry	16
him.”	16
Whereupon	16
the	16
housekeeper	16
said,	16
“Tell	16
us,	16
señor,	16
at	16
his	16
Majesty’s	16
court	16
are	16
there	16
no	16
knights?”	16
“There	16
are,”	16
replied	16
Don	16
Quixote,	16
“and	16
plenty	16
of	16
them;	16
and	16
it	16
is	16
right	16
there	16
should	16
be,	16
to	16
set	16
off	16
the	16
dignity	16
of	16
the	16
prince,	16
and	16
for	16
the	16
greater	16
glory	16
of	16
the	16
king’s	16
majesty.”	16
“Then	16
might	16
not	16
your	16
worship,”	16
said	16
she,	16
“be	16
one	16
of	16
those	16
that,	16
without	16
stirring	16
a	16
step,	16
serve	16
their	16
king	16
and	16
lord	16
in	16
his	16
court?”	16
“Recollect,	16
my	16
friend,”	16
said	16
Don	16
Quixote,	16
“all	16
knights	16
cannot	16
be	16
courtiers,	16
nor	16
can	16
all	16
courtiers	16
be	16
knights-errant,	16
nor	16
need	16
they	16
be.	16
There	16
must	16
be	16
all	16
sorts	16
in	16
the	16
world;	16
and	16
though	16
we	16
may	16
be	16
all	16
knights,	16
there	16
is	16
a	16
great	16
difference	16
between	16
one	16
and	16
another;	16
for	16
the	16
courtiers,	16
without	16
quitting	16
their	16
chambers,	16
or	16
the	16
threshold	16
of	16
the	16
court,	16
range	16
the	16
world	16
over	16
by	16
looking	16
at	16
a	16
map,	16
without	16
its	16
costing	16
them	16
a	16
farthing,	16
and	16
without	16
suffering	16
heat	16
or	16
cold,	16
hunger	16
or	16
thirst;	16
but	16
we,	16
the	16
true	16
knights-errant,	16
measure	16
the	16
whole	16
earth	16
with	16
our	16
own	16
feet,	16
exposed	16
to	16
the	16
sun,	16
to	16
the	16
cold,	16
to	16
the	16
air,	16
to	16
the	16
inclemencies	16
of	16
heaven,	16
by	16
day	16
and	16
night,	16
on	16
foot	16
and	16
on	16
horseback;	16
nor	16
do	16
we	16
only	16
know	16
enemies	16
in	16
pictures,	16
but	16
in	16
their	16
own	16
real	16
shapes;	16
and	16
at	16
all	16
risks	16
and	16
on	16
all	16
occasions	16
we	16
attack	16
them,	16
without	16
any	16
regard	16
to	16
childish	16
points	16
or	16
rules	16
of	16
single	16
combat,	16
whether	16
one	16
has	16
or	16
has	16
not	16
a	16
shorter	16
lance	16
or	16
sword,	16
whether	16
one	16
carries	16
relics	16
or	16
any	16
secret	16
contrivance	16
about	16
him,	16
whether	16
or	16
not	16
the	16
sun	16
is	16
to	16
be	16
divided	16
and	16
portioned	16
out,	16
and	16
other	16
niceties	16
of	16
the	16
sort	16
that	16
are	16
observed	16
in	16
set	16
combats	16
of	16
man	16
to	16
man,	16
that	16
you	16
know	16
nothing	16
about,	16
but	16
I	16
do.	16
And	16
you	16
must	16
know	16
besides,	16
that	16
the	16
true	16
knight-errant,	16
though	16
he	16
may	16
see	16
ten	16
giants,	16
that	16
not	16
only	16
touch	16
the	16
clouds	16
with	16
their	16
heads	16
but	16
pierce	16
them,	16
and	16
that	16
go,	16
each	16
of	16
them,	16
on	16
two	16
tall	16
towers	16
by	16
way	16
of	16
legs,	16
and	16
whose	16
arms	16
are	16
like	16
the	16
masts	16
of	16
mighty	16
ships,	16
and	16
each	16
eye	16
like	16
a	16
great	16
mill-wheel,	16
and	16
glowing	16
brighter	16
than	16
a	16
glass	16
furnace,	16
must	16
not	16
on	16
any	16
account	16
be	16
dismayed	16
by	16
them.	16
On	16
the	16
contrary,	16
he	16
must	16
attack	16
and	16
fall	16
upon	16
them	16
with	16
a	16
gallant	16
bearing	16
and	16
a	16
fearless	16
heart,	16
and,	16
if	16
possible,	16
vanquish	16
and	16
destroy	16
them,	16
even	16
though	16
they	16
have	16
for	16
armour	16
the	16
shells	16
of	16
a	16
certain	16
fish,	16
that	16
they	16
say	16
are	16
harder	16
than	16
diamonds,	16
and	16
in	16
place	16
of	16
swords	16
wield	16
trenchant	16
blades	16
of	16
Damascus	16
steel,	16
or	16
clubs	16
studded	16
with	16
spikes	16
also	16
of	16
steel,	16
such	16
as	16
I	16
have	16
more	16
than	16
once	16
seen.	16
All	16
this	16
I	16
say,	16
housekeeper,	16
that	16
you	16
may	16
see	16
the	16
difference	16
there	16
is	16
between	16
the	16
one	16
sort	16
of	16
knight	16
and	16
the	16
other;	16
and	16
it	16
would	16
be	16
well	16
if	16
there	16
were	16
no	16
prince	16
who	16
did	16
not	16
set	16
a	16
higher	16
value	16
on	16
this	16
second,	16
or	16
more	16
properly	16
speaking	16
first,	16
kind	16
of	16
knights-errant;	16
for,	16
as	16
we	16
read	16
in	16
their	16
histories,	16
there	16
have	16
been	16
some	16
among	16
them	16
who	16
have	16
been	16
the	16
salvation,	16
not	16
merely	16
of	16
one	16
kingdom,	16
but	16
of	16
many.”	16
“Ah,	16
señor,”	16
here	16
exclaimed	16
the	16
niece,	16
“remember	16
that	16
all	16
this	16
you	16
are	16
saying	16
about	16
knights-errant	16
is	16
fable	16
and	16
fiction;	16
and	16
their	16
histories,	16
if	16
indeed	16
they	16
were	16
not	16
burned,	16
would	16
deserve,	16
each	16
of	16
them,	16
to	16
have	16
a	16
sambenito	16
put	16
on	16
it,	16
or	16
some	16
mark	16
by	16
which	16
it	16
might	16
be	16
known	16
as	16
infamous	16
and	16
a	16
corrupter	16
of	16
good	16
manners.”	16
“By	16
the	16
God	16
that	16
gives	16
me	16
life,”	16
said	16
Don	16
Quixote,	16
“if	16
thou	16
wert	16
not	16
my	16
full	16
niece,	16
being	16
daughter	16
of	16
my	16
own	16
sister,	16
I	16
would	16
inflict	16
a	16
chastisement	16
upon	16
thee	16
for	16
the	16
blasphemy	16
thou	16
hast	16
uttered	16
that	16
all	16
the	16
world	16
should	16
ring	16
with.	16
What!	16
can	16
it	16
be	16
that	16
a	16
young	16
hussy	16
that	16
hardly	16
knows	16
how	16
to	16
handle	16
a	16
dozen	16
lace-bobbins	16
dares	16
to	16
wag	16
her	16
tongue	16
and	16
criticise	16
the	16
histories	16
of	16
knights-errant?	16
What	16
would	16
Señor	16
Amadis	16
say	16
if	16
he	16
heard	16
of	16
such	16
a	16
thing?	16
He,	16
however,	16
no	16
doubt	16
would	16
forgive	16
thee,	16
for	16
he	16
was	16
the	16
most	16
humble-minded	16
and	16
courteous	16
knight	16
of	16
his	16
time,	16
and	16
moreover	16
a	16
great	16
protector	16
of	16
damsels;	16
but	16
some	16
there	16
are	16
that	16
might	16
have	16
heard	16
thee,	16
and	16
it	16
would	16
not	16
have	16
been	16
well	16
for	16
thee	16
in	16
that	16
case;	16
for	16
they	16
are	16
not	16
all	16
courteous	16
or	16
mannerly;	16
some	16
are	16
ill-conditioned	16
scoundrels;	16
nor	16
is	16
it	16
everyone	16
that	16
calls	16
himself	16
a	16
gentleman,	16
that	16
is	16
so	16
in	16
all	16
respects;	16
some	16
are	16
gold,	16
others	16
pinchbeck,	16
and	16
all	16
look	16
like	16
gentlemen,	16
but	16
not	16
all	16
can	16
stand	16
the	16
touchstone	16
of	16
truth.	16
There	16
are	16
men	16
of	16
low	16
rank	16
who	16
strain	16
themselves	16
to	16
bursting	16
to	16
pass	16
for	16
gentlemen,	16
and	16
high	16
gentlemen	16
who,	16
one	16
would	16
fancy,	16
were	16
dying	16
to	16
pass	16
for	16
men	16
of	16
low	16
rank;	16
the	16
former	16
raise	16
themselves	16
by	16
their	16
ambition	16
or	16
by	16
their	16
virtues,	16
the	16
latter	16
debase	16
themselves	16
by	16
their	16
lack	16
of	16
spirit	16
or	16
by	16
their	16
vices;	16
and	16
one	16
has	16
need	16
of	16
experience	16
and	16
discernment	16
to	16
distinguish	16
these	16
two	16
kinds	16
of	16
gentlemen,	16
so	16
much	16
alike	16
in	16
name	16
and	16
so	16
different	16
in	16
conduct.”	16
“God	16
bless	16
me!”	16
said	16
the	16
niece,	16
“that	16
you	16
should	16
know	16
so	16
much,	16
uncle—enough,	16
if	16
need	16
be,	16
to	16
get	16
up	16
into	16
a	16
pulpit	16
and	16
go	16
preach	16
in	16
the	16
streets—and	16
yet	16
that	16
you	16
should	16
fall	16
into	16
a	16
delusion	16
so	16
great	16
and	16
a	16
folly	16
so	16
manifest	16
as	16
to	16
try	16
to	16
make	16
yourself	16
out	16
vigorous	16
when	16
you	16
are	16
old,	16
strong	16
when	16
you	16
are	16
sickly,	16
able	16
to	16
put	16
straight	16
what	16
is	16
crooked	16
when	16
you	16
yourself	16
are	16
bent	16
by	16
age,	16
and,	16
above	16
all,	16
a	16
caballero	16
when	16
you	16
are	16
not	16
one;	16
for	16
though	16
gentlefolk	16
may	16
be	16
so,	16
poor	16
men	16
are	16
nothing	16
of	16
the	16
kind!”	16
“There	16
is	16
a	16
great	16
deal	16
of	16
truth	16
in	16
what	16
you	16
say,	16
niece,”	16
returned	16
Don	16
Quixote,	16
“and	16
I	16
could	16
tell	16
you	16
somewhat	16
about	16
birth	16
that	16
would	16
astonish	16
you;	16
but,	16
not	16
to	16
mix	16
up	16
things	16
human	16
and	16
divine,	16
I	16
refrain.	16
Look	16
you,	16
my	16
dears,	16
all	16
the	16
lineages	16
in	16
the	16
world	16
(attend	16
to	16
what	16
I	16
am	16
saying)	16
can	16
be	16
reduced	16
to	16
four	16
sorts,	16
which	16
are	16
these:	16
those	16
that	16
had	16
humble	16
beginnings,	16
and	16
went	16
on	16
spreading	16
and	16
extending	16
themselves	16
until	16
they	16
attained	16
surpassing	16
greatness;	16
those	16
that	16
had	16
great	16
beginnings	16
and	16
maintained	16
them,	16
and	16
still	16
maintain	16
and	16
uphold	16
the	16
greatness	16
of	16
their	16
origin;	16
those,	16
again,	16
that	16
from	16
a	16
great	16
beginning	16
have	16
ended	16
in	16
a	16
point	16
like	16
a	16
pyramid,	16
having	16
reduced	16
and	16
lessened	16
their	16
original	16
greatness	16
till	16
it	16
has	16
come	16
to	16
nought,	16
like	16
the	16
point	16
of	16
a	16
pyramid,	16
which,	16
relatively	16
to	16
its	16
base	16
or	16
foundation,	16
is	16
nothing;	16
and	16
then	16
there	16
are	16
those—and	16
it	16
is	16
they	16
that	16
are	16
the	16
most	16
numerous—that	16
have	16
had	16
neither	16
an	16
illustrious	16
beginning	16
nor	16
a	16
remarkable	16
mid-course,	16
and	16
so	16
will	16
have	16
an	16
end	16
without	16
a	16
name,	16
like	16
an	16
ordinary	16
plebeian	16
line.	16
Of	16
the	16
first,	16
those	16
that	16
had	16
an	16
humble	16
origin	16
and	16
rose	16
to	16
the	16
greatness	16
they	16
still	16
preserve,	16
the	16
Ottoman	16
house	16
may	16
serve	16
as	16
an	16
example,	16
which	16
from	16
an	16
humble	16
and	16
lowly	16
shepherd,	16
its	16
founder,	16
has	16
reached	16
the	16
height	16
at	16
which	16
we	16
now	16
see	16
it.	16
For	16
examples	16
of	16
the	16
second	16
sort	16
of	16
lineage,	16
that	16
began	16
with	16
greatness	16
and	16
maintains	16
it	16
still	16
without	16
adding	16
to	16
it,	16
there	16
are	16
the	16
many	16
princes	16
who	16
have	16
inherited	16
the	16
dignity,	16
and	16
maintain	16
themselves	16
in	16
their	16
inheritance,	16
without	16
increasing	16
or	16
diminishing	16
it,	16
keeping	16
peacefully	16
within	16
the	16
limits	16
of	16
their	16
states.	16
Of	16
those	16
that	16
began	16
great	16
and	16
ended	16
in	16
a	16
point,	16
there	16
are	16
thousands	16
of	16
examples,	16
for	16
all	16
the	16
Pharaohs	16
and	16
Ptolemies	16
of	16
Egypt,	16
the	16
Cæsars	16
of	16
Rome,	16
and	16
the	16
whole	16
herd	16
(if	16
I	16
may	16
apply	16
such	16
a	16
word	16
to	16
them)	16
of	16
countless	16
princes,	16
monarchs,	16
lords,	16
Medes,	16
Assyrians,	16
Persians,	16
Greeks,	16
and	16
barbarians,	16
all	16
these	16
lineages	16
and	16
lordships	16
have	16
ended	16
in	16
a	16
point	16
and	16
come	16
to	16
nothing,	16
they	16
themselves	16
as	16
well	16
as	16
their	16
founders,	16
for	16
it	16
would	16
be	16
impossible	16
now	16
to	16
find	16
one	16
of	16
their	16
descendants,	16
and,	16
even	16
should	16
we	16
find	16
one,	16
it	16
would	16
be	16
in	16
some	16
lowly	16
and	16
humble	16
condition.	16
Of	16
plebeian	16
lineages	16
I	16
have	16
nothing	16
to	16
say,	16
save	16
that	16
they	16
merely	16
serve	16
to	16
swell	16
the	16
number	16
of	16
those	16
that	16
live,	16
without	16
any	16
eminence	16
to	16
entitle	16
them	16
to	16
any	16
fame	16
or	16
praise	16
beyond	16
this.	16
From	16
all	16
I	16
have	16
said	16
I	16
would	16
have	16
you	16
gather,	16
my	16
poor	16
innocents,	16
that	16
great	16
is	16
the	16
confusion	16
among	16
lineages,	16
and	16
that	16
only	16
those	16
are	16
seen	16
to	16
be	16
great	16
and	16
illustrious	16
that	16
show	16
themselves	16
so	16
by	16
the	16
virtue,	16
wealth,	16
and	16
generosity	16
of	16
their	16
possessors.	16
I	16
have	16
said	16
virtue,	16
wealth,	16
and	16
generosity,	16
because	16
a	16
great	16
man	16
who	16
is	16
vicious	16
will	16
be	16
a	16
great	16
example	16
of	16
vice,	16
and	16
a	16
rich	16
man	16
who	16
is	16
not	16
generous	16
will	16
be	16
merely	16
a	16
miserly	16
beggar;	16
for	16
the	16
possessor	16
of	16
wealth	16
is	16
not	16
made	16
happy	16
by	16
possessing	16
it,	16
but	16
by	16
spending	16
it,	16
and	16
not	16
by	16
spending	16
as	16
he	16
pleases,	16
but	16
by	16
knowing	16
how	16
to	16
spend	16
it	16
well.	16
The	16
poor	16
gentleman	16
has	16
no	16
way	16
of	16
showing	16
that	16
he	16
is	16
a	16
gentleman	16
but	16
by	16
virtue,	16
by	16
being	16
affable,	16
well-bred,	16
courteous,	16
gentle-mannered,	16
and	16
kindly,	16
not	16
haughty,	16
arrogant,	16
or	16
censorious,	16
but	16
above	16
all	16
by	16
being	16
charitable;	16
for	16
by	16
two	16
maravedis	16
given	16
with	16
a	16
cheerful	16
heart	16
to	16
the	16
poor,	16
he	16
will	16
show	16
himself	16
as	16
generous	16
as	16
he	16
who	16
distributes	16
alms	16
with	16
bell-ringing,	16
and	16
no	16
one	16
that	16
perceives	16
him	16
to	16
be	16
endowed	16
with	16
the	16
virtues	16
I	16
have	16
named,	16
even	16
though	16
he	16
know	16
him	16
not,	16
will	16
fail	16
to	16
recognise	16
and	16
set	16
him	16
down	16
as	16
one	16
of	16
good	16
blood;	16
and	16
it	16
would	16
be	16
strange	16
were	16
it	16
not	16
so;	16
praise	16
has	16
ever	16
been	16
the	16
reward	16
of	16
virtue,	16
and	16
those	16
who	16
are	16
virtuous	16
cannot	16
fail	16
to	16
receive	16
commendation.	16
There	16
are	16
two	16
roads,	16
my	16
daughters,	16
by	16
which	16
men	16
may	16
reach	16
wealth	16
and	16
honours;	16
one	16
is	16
that	16
of	16
letters,	16
the	16
other	16
that	16
of	16
arms.	16
I	16
have	16
more	16
of	16
arms	16
than	16
of	16
letters	16
in	16
my	16
composition,	16
and,	16
judging	16
by	16
my	16
inclination	16
to	16
arms,	16
was	16
born	16
under	16
the	16
influence	16
of	16
the	16
planet	16
Mars.	16
I	16
am,	16
therefore,	16
in	16
a	16
measure	16
constrained	16
to	16
follow	16
that	16
road,	16
and	16
by	16
it	16
I	16
must	16
travel	16
in	16
spite	16
of	16
all	16
the	16
world,	16
and	16
it	16
will	16
be	16
labour	16
in	16
vain	16
for	16
you	16
to	16
urge	16
me	16
to	16
resist	16
what	16
heaven	16
wills,	16
fate	16
ordains,	16
reason	16
requires,	16
and,	16
above	16
all,	16
my	16
own	16
inclination	16
favours;	16
for	16
knowing	16
as	16
I	16
do	16
the	16
countless	16
toils	16
that	16
are	16
the	16
accompaniments	16
of	16
knight-errantry,	16
I	16
know,	16
too,	16
the	16
infinite	16
blessings	16
that	16
are	16
attained	16
by	16
it;	16
I	16
know	16
that	16
the	16
path	16
of	16
virtue	16
is	16
very	16
narrow,	16
and	16
the	16
road	16
of	16
vice	16
broad	16
and	16
spacious;	16
I	16
know	16
their	16
ends	16
and	16
goals	16
are	16
different,	16
for	16
the	16
broad	16
and	16
easy	16
road	16
of	16
vice	16
ends	16
in	16
death,	16
and	16
the	16
narrow	16
and	16
toilsome	16
one	16
of	16
virtue	16
in	16
life,	16
and	16
not	16
transitory	16
life,	16
but	16
in	16
that	16
which	16
has	16
no	16
end;	16
I	16
know,	16
as	16
our	16
great	16
Castilian	16
poet	16
says,	16
that-	16
It	16
is	16
by	16
rugged	16
paths	16
like	16
these	16
they	16
go	16
That	16
scale	16
the	16
heights	16
of	16
immortality,	16
Unreached	16
by	16
those	16
that	16
falter	16
here	16
below.”	16
“Woe	16
is	16
me!”	16
exclaimed	16
the	16
niece,	16
“my	16
lord	16
is	16
a	16
poet,	16
too!	16
He	16
knows	16
everything,	16
and	16
he	16
can	16
do	16
everything;	16
I	16
will	16
bet,	16
if	16
he	16
chose	16
to	16
turn	16
mason,	16
he	16
could	16
make	16
a	16
house	16
as	16
easily	16
as	16
a	16
cage.”	16
“I	16
can	16
tell	16
you,	16
niece,”	16
replied	16
Don	16
Quixote,	16
“if	16
these	16
chivalrous	16
thoughts	16
did	16
not	16
engage	16
all	16
my	16
faculties,	16
there	16
would	16
be	16
nothing	16
that	16
I	16
could	16
not	16
do,	16
nor	16
any	16
sort	16
of	16
knickknack	16
that	16
would	16
not	16
come	16
from	16
my	16
hands,	16
particularly	16
cages	16
and	16
tooth-picks.”	16
At	16
this	16
moment	16
there	16
came	16
a	16
knocking	16
at	16
the	16
door,	16
and	16
when	16
they	16
asked	16
who	16
was	16
there,	16
Sancho	16
Panza	16
made	16
answer	16
that	16
it	16
was	16
he.	16
The	16
instant	16
the	16
housekeeper	16
knew	16
who	16
it	16
was,	16
she	16
ran	16
to	16
hide	16
herself	16
so	16
as	16
not	16
to	16
see	16
him;	16
in	16
such	16
abhorrence	16
did	16
she	16
hold	16
him.	16
The	16
niece	16
let	16
him	16
in,	16
and	16
his	16
master	16
Don	16
Quixote	16
came	16
forward	16
to	16
receive	16
him	16
with	16
open	16
arms,	16
and	16
the	16
pair	16
shut	16
themselves	16
up	16
in	16
his	16
room,	16
where	16
they	16
had	16
another	16
conversation	16
not	16
inferior	16
to	16
the	16
previous	16
one.	16

The	16
instant	16
the	16
housekeeper	16
saw	16
Sancho	16
Panza	16
shut	16
himself	16
in	16
with	16
her	16
master,	16
she	16
guessed	16
what	16
they	16
were	16
about;	16
and	16
suspecting	16
that	16
the	16
result	16
of	16
the	16
consultation	16
would	16
be	16
a	16
resolve	16
to	16
undertake	16
a	16
third	16
sally,	16
she	16
seized	16
her	16
mantle,	16
and	16
in	16
deep	16
anxiety	16
and	16
distress,	16
ran	16
to	16
find	16
the	16
bachelor	16
Samson	16
Carrasco,	16
as	16
she	16
thought	16
that,	16
being	16
a	16
well-spoken	16
man,	16
and	16
a	16
new	16
friend	16
of	16
her	16
master’s,	16
he	16
might	16
be	16
able	16
to	16
persuade	16
him	16
to	16
give	16
up	16
any	16
such	16
crazy	16
notion.	16
She	16
found	16
him	16
pacing	16
the	16
patio	16
of	16
his	16
house,	16
and,	16
perspiring	16
and	16
flurried,	16
she	16
fell	16
at	16
his	16
feet	16
the	16
moment	16
she	16
saw	16
him.	16
Carrasco,	16
seeing	16
how	16
distressed	16
and	16
overcome	16
she	16
was,	16
said	16
to	16
her,	16
“What	16
is	16
this,	16
mistress	16
housekeeper?	16
What	16
has	16
happened	16
to	16
you?	16
One	16
would	16
think	16
you	16
heart-broken.”	16
“Nothing,	16
Señor	16
Samson,”	16
said	16
she,	16
“only	16
that	16
my	16
master	16
is	16
breaking	16
out,	16
plainly	16
breaking	16
out.”	16
“Whereabouts	16
is	16
he	16
breaking	16
out,	16
señora?”	16
asked	16
Samson;	16
“has	16
any	16
part	16
of	16
his	16
body	16
burst?”	16
“He	16
is	16
only	16
breaking	16
out	16
at	16
the	16
door	16
of	16
his	16
madness,”	16
she	16
replied;	16
“I	16
mean,	16
dear	16
señor	16
bachelor,	16
that	16
he	16
is	16
going	16
to	16
break	16
out	16
again	16
(and	16
this	16
will	16
be	16
the	16
third	16
time)	16
to	16
hunt	16
all	16
over	16
the	16
world	16
for	16
what	16
he	16
calls	16
ventures,	16
though	16
I	16
can’t	16
make	16
out	16
why	16
he	16
gives	16
them	16
that	16
name.	16
The	16
first	16
time	16
he	16
was	16
brought	16
back	16
to	16
us	16
slung	16
across	16
the	16
back	16
of	16
an	16
ass,	16
and	16
belaboured	16
all	16
over;	16
and	16
the	16
second	16
time	16
he	16
came	16
in	16
an	16
ox-cart,	16
shut	16
up	16
in	16
a	16
cage,	16
in	16
which	16
he	16
persuaded	16
himself	16
he	16
was	16
enchanted,	16
and	16
the	16
poor	16
creature	16
was	16
in	16
such	16
a	16
state	16
that	16
the	16
mother	16
that	16
bore	16
him	16
would	16
not	16
have	16
known	16
him;	16
lean,	16
yellow,	16
with	16
his	16
eyes	16
sunk	16
deep	16
in	16
the	16
cells	16
of	16
his	16
skull;	16
so	16
that	16
to	16
bring	16
him	16
round	16
again,	16
ever	16
so	16
little,	16
cost	16
me	16
more	16
than	16
six	16
hundred	16
eggs,	16
as	16
God	16
knows,	16
and	16
all	16
the	16
world,	16
and	16
my	16
hens	16
too,	16
that	16
won’t	16
let	16
me	16
tell	16
a	16
lie.”	16
“That	16
I	16
can	16
well	16
believe,”	16
replied	16
the	16
bachelor,	16
“for	16
they	16
are	16
so	16
good	16
and	16
so	16
fat,	16
and	16
so	16
well-bred,	16
that	16
they	16
would	16
not	16
say	16
one	16
thing	16
for	16
another,	16
though	16
they	16
were	16
to	16
burst	16
for	16
it.	16
In	16
short	16
then,	16
mistress	16
housekeeper,	16
that	16
is	16
all,	16
and	16
there	16
is	16
nothing	16
the	16
matter,	16
except	16
what	16
it	16
is	16
feared	16
Don	16
Quixote	16
may	16
do?”	16
“No,	16
señor,”	16
said	16
she.	16
“Well	16
then,”	16
returned	16
the	16
bachelor,	16
“don’t	16
be	16
uneasy,	16
but	16
go	16
home	16
in	16
peace;	16
get	16
me	16
ready	16
something	16
hot	16
for	16
breakfast,	16
and	16
while	16
you	16
are	16
on	16
the	16
way	16
say	16
the	16
prayer	16
of	16
Santa	16
Apollonia,	16
that	16
is	16
if	16
you	16
know	16
it;	16
for	16
I	16
will	16
come	16
presently	16
and	16
you	16
will	16
see	16
miracles.”	16
“Woe	16
is	16
me,”	16
cried	16
the	16
housekeeper,	16
“is	16
it	16
the	16
prayer	16
of	16
Santa	16
Apollonia	16
you	16
would	16
have	16
me	16
say?	16
That	16
would	16
do	16
if	16
it	16
was	16
the	16
toothache	16
my	16
master	16
had;	16
but	16
it	16
is	16
in	16
the	16
brains,	16
what	16
he	16
has	16
got.”	16
“I	16
know	16
what	16
I	16
am	16
saying,	16
mistress	16
housekeeper;	16
go,	16
and	16
don’t	16
set	16
yourself	16
to	16
argue	16
with	16
me,	16
for	16
you	16
know	16
I	16
am	16
a	16
bachelor	16
of	16
Salamanca,	16
and	16
one	16
can’t	16
be	16
more	16
of	16
a	16
bachelor	16
than	16
that,”	16
replied	16
Carrasco;	16
and	16
with	16
this	16
the	16
housekeeper	16
retired,	16
and	16
the	16
bachelor	16
went	16
to	16
look	16
for	16
the	16
curate,	16
and	16
arrange	16
with	16
him	16
what	16
will	16
be	16
told	16
in	16
its	16
proper	16
place.	16
While	16
Don	16
Quixote	16
and	16
Sancho	16
were	16
shut	16
up	16
together,	16
they	16
had	16
a	16
discussion	16
which	16
the	16
history	16
records	16
with	16
great	16
precision	16
and	16
scrupulous	16
exactness.	16
Sancho	16
said	16
to	16
his	16
master,	16
“Señor,	16
I	16
have	16
educed	16
my	16
wife	16
to	16
let	16
me	16
go	16
with	16
your	16
worship	16
wherever	16
you	16
choose	16
to	16
take	16
me.”	16
“Induced,	16
you	16
should	16
say,	16
Sancho,”	16
said	16
Don	16
Quixote;	16
“not	16
educed.”	16
“Once	16
or	16
twice,	16
as	16
well	16
as	16
I	16
remember,”	16
replied	16
Sancho,	16
“I	16
have	16
begged	16
of	16
your	16
worship	16
not	16
to	16
mend	16
my	16
words,	16
if	16
so	16
be	16
as	16
you	16
understand	16
what	16
I	16
mean	16
by	16
them;	16
and	16
if	16
you	16
don’t	16
understand	16
them	16
to	16
say	16
‘Sancho,’	16
or	16
‘devil,’	16
‘I	16
don’t	16
understand	16
thee;	16
and	16
if	16
I	16
don’t	16
make	16
my	16
meaning	16
plain,	16
then	16
you	16
may	16
correct	16
me,	16
for	16
I	16
am	16
so	16
focile—”	16
“I	16
don’t	16
understand	16
thee,	16
Sancho,”	16
said	16
Don	16
Quixote	16
at	16
once;	16
“for	16
I	16
know	16
not	16
what	16
‘I	16
am	16
so	16
focile’	16
means.”	16
“‘So	16
focile’	16
means	16
I	16
am	16
so	16
much	16
that	16
way,”	16
replied	16
Sancho.	16
“I	16
understand	16
thee	16
still	16
less	16
now,”	16
said	16
Don	16
Quixote.	16
“Well,	16
if	16
you	16
can’t	16
understand	16
me,”	16
said	16
Sancho,	16
“I	16
don’t	16
know	16
how	16
to	16
put	16
it;	16
I	16
know	16
no	16
more,	16
God	16
help	16
me.”	16
“Oh,	16
now	16
I	16
have	16
hit	16
it,”	16
said	16
Don	16
Quixote;	16
“thou	16
wouldst	16
say	16
thou	16
art	16
so	16
docile,	16
tractable,	16
and	16
gentle	16
that	16
thou	16
wilt	16
take	16
what	16
I	16
say	16
to	16
thee,	16
and	16
submit	16
to	16
what	16
I	16
teach	16
thee.”	16
“I	16
would	16
bet,”	16
said	16
Sancho,	16
“that	16
from	16
the	16
very	16
first	16
you	16
understood	16
me,	16
and	16
knew	16
what	16
I	16
meant,	16
but	16
you	16
wanted	16
to	16
put	16
me	16
out	16
that	16
you	16
might	16
hear	16
me	16
make	16
another	16
couple	16
of	16
dozen	16
blunders.”	16
“May	16
be	16
so,”	16
replied	16
Don	16
Quixote;	16
“but	16
to	16
come	16
to	16
the	16
point,	16
what	16
does	16
Teresa	16
say?”	16
“Teresa	16
says,”	16
replied	16
Sancho,	16
“that	16
I	16
should	16
make	16
sure	16
with	16
your	16
worship,	16
and	16
‘let	16
papers	16
speak	16
and	16
beards	16
be	16
still,’	16
for	16
‘he	16
who	16
binds	16
does	16
not	16
wrangle,’	16
since	16
one	16
‘take’	16
is	16
better	16
than	16
two	16
‘I’ll	16
give	16
thee’s;’	16
and	16
I	16
say	16
a	16
woman’s	16
advice	16
is	16
no	16
great	16
thing,	16
and	16
he	16
who	16
won’t	16
take	16
it	16
is	16
a	16
fool.”	16
“And	16
so	16
say	16
I,”	16
said	16
Don	16
Quixote;	16
“continue,	16
Sancho	16
my	16
friend;	16
go	16
on;	16
you	16
talk	16
pearls	16
to-day.”	16
“The	16
fact	16
is,”	16
continued	16
Sancho,	16
“that,	16
as	16
your	16
worship	16
knows	16
better	16
than	16
I	16
do,	16
we	16
are	16
all	16
of	16
us	16
liable	16
to	16
death,	16
and	16
to-day	16
we	16
are,	16
and	16
to-morrow	16
we	16
are	16
not,	16
and	16
the	16
lamb	16
goes	16
as	16
soon	16
as	16
the	16
sheep,	16
and	16
nobody	16
can	16
promise	16
himself	16
more	16
hours	16
of	16
life	16
in	16
this	16
world	16
than	16
God	16
may	16
be	16
pleased	16
to	16
give	16
him;	16
for	16
death	16
is	16
deaf,	16
and	16
when	16
it	16
comes	16
to	16
knock	16
at	16
our	16
life’s	16
door,	16
it	16
is	16
always	16
urgent,	16
and	16
neither	16
prayers,	16
nor	16
struggles,	16
nor	16
sceptres,	16
nor	16
mitres,	16
can	16
keep	16
it	16
back,	16
as	16
common	16
talk	16
and	16
report	16
say,	16
and	16
as	16
they	16
tell	16
us	16
from	16
the	16
pulpits	16
every	16
day.”	16
“All	16
that	16
is	16
very	16
true,”	16
said	16
Don	16
Quixote;	16
“but	16
I	16
cannot	16
make	16
out	16
what	16
thou	16
art	16
driving	16
at.”	16
“What	16
I	16
am	16
driving	16
at,”	16
said	16
Sancho,	16
“is	16
that	16
your	16
worship	16
settle	16
some	16
fixed	16
wages	16
for	16
me,	16
to	16
be	16
paid	16
monthly	16
while	16
I	16
am	16
in	16
your	16
service,	16
and	16
that	16
the	16
same	16
be	16
paid	16
me	16
out	16
of	16
your	16
estate;	16
for	16
I	16
don’t	16
care	16
to	16
stand	16
on	16
rewards	16
which	16
either	16
come	16
late,	16
or	16
ill,	16
or	16
never	16
at	16
all;	16
God	16
help	16
me	16
with	16
my	16
own.	16
In	16
short,	16
I	16
would	16
like	16
to	16
know	16
what	16
I	16
am	16
to	16
get,	16
be	16
it	16
much	16
or	16
little;	16
for	16
the	16
hen	16
will	16
lay	16
on	16
one	16
egg,	16
and	16
many	16
littles	16
make	16
a	16
much,	16
and	16
so	16
long	16
as	16
one	16
gains	16
something	16
there	16
is	16
nothing	16
lost.	16
To	16
be	16
sure,	16
if	16
it	16
should	16
happen	16
(what	16
I	16
neither	16
believe	16
nor	16
expect)	16
that	16
your	16
worship	16
were	16
to	16
give	16
me	16
that	16
island	16
you	16
have	16
promised	16
me,	16
I	16
am	16
not	16
so	16
ungrateful	16
nor	16
so	16
grasping	16
but	16
that	16
I	16
would	16
be	16
willing	16
to	16
have	16
the	16
revenue	16
of	16
such	16
island	16
valued	16
and	16
stopped	16
out	16
of	16
my	16
wages	16
in	16
due	16
promotion.”	16
“Sancho,	16
my	16
friend,”	16
replied	16
Don	16
Quixote,	16
“sometimes	16
proportion	16
may	16
be	16
as	16
good	16
as	16
promotion.”	16
“I	16
see,”	16
said	16
Sancho;	16
“I’ll	16
bet	16
I	16
ought	16
to	16
have	16
said	16
proportion,	16
and	16
not	16
promotion;	16
but	16
it	16
is	16
no	16
matter,	16
as	16
your	16
worship	16
has	16
understood	16
me.”	16
“And	16
so	16
well	16
understood,”	16
returned	16
Don	16
Quixote,	16
“that	16
I	16
have	16
seen	16
into	16
the	16
depths	16
of	16
thy	16
thoughts,	16
and	16
know	16
the	16
mark	16
thou	16
art	16
shooting	16
at	16
with	16
the	16
countless	16
shafts	16
of	16
thy	16
proverbs.	16
Look	16
here,	16
Sancho,	16
I	16
would	16
readily	16
fix	16
thy	16
wages	16
if	16
I	16
had	16
ever	16
found	16
any	16
instance	16
in	16
the	16
histories	16
of	16
the	16
knights-errant	16
to	16
show	16
or	16
indicate,	16
by	16
the	16
slightest	16
hint,	16
what	16
their	16
squires	16
used	16
to	16
get	16
monthly	16
or	16
yearly;	16
but	16
I	16
have	16
read	16
all	16
or	16
the	16
best	16
part	16
of	16
their	16
histories,	16
and	16
I	16
cannot	16
remember	16
reading	16
of	16
any	16
knight-errant	16
having	16
assigned	16
fixed	16
wages	16
to	16
his	16
squire;	16
I	16
only	16
know	16
that	16
they	16
all	16
served	16
on	16
reward,	16
and	16
that	16
when	16
they	16
least	16
expected	16
it,	16
if	16
good	16
luck	16
attended	16
their	16
masters,	16
they	16
found	16
themselves	16
recompensed	16
with	16
an	16
island	16
or	16
something	16
equivalent	16
to	16
it,	16
or	16
at	16
the	16
least	16
they	16
were	16
left	16
with	16
a	16
title	16
and	16
lordship.	16
If	16
with	16
these	16
hopes	16
and	16
additional	16
inducements	16
you,	16
Sancho,	16
please	16
to	16
return	16
to	16
my	16
service,	16
well	16
and	16
good;	16
but	16
to	16
suppose	16
that	16
I	16
am	16
going	16
to	16
disturb	16
or	16
unhinge	16
the	16
ancient	16
usage	16
of	16
knight-errantry,	16
is	16
all	16
nonsense.	16
And	16
so,	16
my	16
Sancho,	16
get	16
you	16
back	16
to	16
your	16
house	16
and	16
explain	16
my	16
intentions	16
to	16
your	16
Teresa,	16
and	16
if	16
she	16
likes	16
and	16
you	16
like	16
to	16
be	16
on	16
reward	16
with	16
me,	16
_bene	16
quidem;_	16
if	16
not,	16
we	16
remain	16
friends;	16
for	16
if	16
the	16
pigeon-house	16
does	16
not	16
lack	16
food,	16
it	16
will	16
not	16
lack	16
pigeons;	16
and	16
bear	16
in	16
mind,	16
my	16
son,	16
that	16
a	16
good	16
hope	16
is	16
better	16
than	16
a	16
bad	16
holding,	16
and	16
a	16
good	16
grievance	16
better	16
than	16
a	16
bad	16
compensation.	16
I	16
speak	16
in	16
this	16
way,	16
Sancho,	16
to	16
show	16
you	16
that	16
I	16
can	16
shower	16
down	16
proverbs	16
just	16
as	16
well	16
as	16
yourself;	16
and	16
in	16
short,	16
I	16
mean	16
to	16
say,	16
and	16
I	16
do	16
say,	16
that	16
if	16
you	16
don’t	16
like	16
to	16
come	16
on	16
reward	16
with	16
me,	16
and	16
run	16
the	16
same	16
chance	16
that	16
I	16
run,	16
God	16
be	16
with	16
you	16
and	16
make	16
a	16
saint	16
of	16
you;	16
for	16
I	16
shall	16
find	16
plenty	16
of	16
squires	16
more	16
obedient	16
and	16
painstaking,	16
and	16
not	16
so	16
thickheaded	16
or	16
talkative	16
as	16
you	16
are.”	16
When	16
Sancho	16
heard	16
his	16
master’s	16
firm,	16
resolute	16
language,	16
a	16
cloud	16
came	16
over	16
the	16
sky	16
with	16
him	16
and	16
the	16
wings	16
of	16
his	16
heart	16
drooped,	16
for	16
he	16
had	16
made	16
sure	16
that	16
his	16
master	16
would	16
not	16
go	16
without	16
him	16
for	16
all	16
the	16
wealth	16
of	16
the	16
world;	16
and	16
as	16
he	16
stood	16
there	16
dumbfoundered	16
and	16
moody,	16
Samson	16
Carrasco	16
came	16
in	16
with	16
the	16
housekeeper	16
and	16
niece,	16
who	16
were	16
anxious	16
to	16
hear	16
by	16
what	16
arguments	16
he	16
was	16
about	16
to	16
dissuade	16
their	16
master	16
from	16
going	16
to	16
seek	16
adventures.	16
The	16
arch	16
wag	16
Samson	16
came	16
forward,	16
and	16
embracing	16
him	16
as	16
he	16
had	16
done	16
before,	16
said	16
with	16
a	16
loud	16
voice,	16
“O	16
flower	16
of	16
knight-errantry!	16
O	16
shining	16
light	16
of	16
arms!	16
O	16
honour	16
and	16
mirror	16
of	16
the	16
Spanish	16
nation!	16
may	16
God	16
Almighty	16
in	16
his	16
infinite	16
power	16
grant	16
that	16
any	16
person	16
or	16
persons,	16
who	16
would	16
impede	16
or	16
hinder	16
thy	16
third	16
sally,	16
may	16
find	16
no	16
way	16
out	16
of	16
the	16
labyrinth	16
of	16
their	16
schemes,	16
nor	16
ever	16
accomplish	16
what	16
they	16
most	16
desire!”	16
And	16
then,	16
turning	16
to	16
the	16
housekeeper,	16
he	16
said,	16
“Mistress	16
housekeeper	16
may	16
just	16
as	16
well	16
give	16
over	16
saying	16
the	16
prayer	16
of	16
Santa	16
Apollonia,	16
for	16
I	16
know	16
it	16
is	16
the	16
positive	16
determination	16
of	16
the	16
spheres	16
that	16
Señor	16
Don	16
Quixote	16
shall	16
proceed	16
to	16
put	16
into	16
execution	16
his	16
new	16
and	16
lofty	16
designs;	16
and	16
I	16
should	16
lay	16
a	16
heavy	16
burden	16
on	16
my	16
conscience	16
did	16
I	16
not	16
urge	16
and	16
persuade	16
this	16
knight	16
not	16
to	16
keep	16
the	16
might	16
of	16
his	16
strong	16
arm	16
and	16
the	16
virtue	16
of	16
his	16
valiant	16
spirit	16
any	16
longer	16
curbed	16
and	16
checked,	16
for	16
by	16
his	16
inactivity	16
he	16
is	16
defrauding	16
the	16
world	16
of	16
the	16
redress	16
of	16
wrongs,	16
of	16
the	16
protection	16
of	16
orphans,	16
of	16
the	16
honour	16
of	16
virgins,	16
of	16
the	16
aid	16
of	16
widows,	16
and	16
of	16
the	16
support	16
of	16
wives,	16
and	16
other	16
matters	16
of	16
this	16
kind	16
appertaining,	16
belonging,	16
proper	16
and	16
peculiar	16
to	16
the	16
order	16
of	16
knight-errantry.	16
On,	16
then,	16
my	16
lord	16
Don	16
Quixote,	16
beautiful	16
and	16
brave,	16
let	16
your	16
worship	16
and	16
highness	16
set	16
out	16
to-day	16
rather	16
than	16
to-morrow;	16
and	16
if	16
anything	16
be	16
needed	16
for	16
the	16
execution	16
of	16
your	16
purpose,	16
here	16
am	16
I	16
ready	16
in	16
person	16
and	16
purse	16
to	16
supply	16
the	16
want;	16
and	16
were	16
it	16
requisite	16
to	16
attend	16
your	16
magnificence	16
as	16
squire,	16
I	16
should	16
esteem	16
it	16
the	16
happiest	16
good	16
fortune.”	16
At	16
this,	16
Don	16
Quixote,	16
turning	16
to	16
Sancho,	16
said,	16
“Did	16
I	16
not	16
tell	16
thee,	16
Sancho,	16
there	16
would	16
be	16
squires	16
enough	16
and	16
to	16
spare	16
for	16
me?	16
See	16
now	16
who	16
offers	16
to	16
become	16
one;	16
no	16
less	16
than	16
the	16
illustrious	16
bachelor	16
Samson	16
Carrasco,	16
the	16
perpetual	16
joy	16
and	16
delight	16
of	16
the	16
courts	16
of	16
the	16
Salamancan	16
schools,	16
sound	16
in	16
body,	16
discreet,	16
patient	16
under	16
heat	16
or	16
cold,	16
hunger	16
or	16
thirst,	16
with	16
all	16
the	16
qualifications	16
requisite	16
to	16
make	16
a	16
knight-errant’s	16
squire!	16
But	16
heaven	16
forbid	16
that,	16
to	16
gratify	16
my	16
own	16
inclination,	16
I	16
should	16
shake	16
or	16
shatter	16
this	16
pillar	16
of	16
letters	16
and	16
vessel	16
of	16
the	16
sciences,	16
and	16
cut	16
down	16
this	16
towering	16
palm	16
of	16
the	16
fair	16
and	16
liberal	16
arts.	16
Let	16
this	16
new	16
Samson	16
remain	16
in	16
his	16
own	16
country,	16
and,	16
bringing	16
honour	16
to	16
it,	16
bring	16
honour	16
at	16
the	16
same	16
time	16
on	16
the	16
grey	16
heads	16
of	16
his	16
venerable	16
parents;	16
for	16
I	16
will	16
be	16
content	16
with	16
any	16
squire	16
that	16
comes	16
to	16
hand,	16
as	16
Sancho	16
does	16
not	16
deign	16
to	16
accompany	16
me.”	16
“I	16
do	16
deign,”	16
said	16
Sancho,	16
deeply	16
moved	16
and	16
with	16
tears	16
in	16
his	16
eyes;	16
“it	16
shall	16
not	16
be	16
said	16
of	16
me,	16
master	16
mine,”	16
he	16
continued,	16
“‘the	16
bread	16
eaten	16
and	16
the	16
company	16
dispersed.’	16
Nay,	16
I	16
come	16
of	16
no	16
ungrateful	16
stock,	16
for	16
all	16
the	16
world	16
knows,	16
but	16
particularly	16
my	16
own	16
town,	16
who	16
the	16
Panzas	16
from	16
whom	16
I	16
am	16
descended	16
were;	16
and,	16
what	16
is	16
more,	16
I	16
know	16
and	16
have	16
learned,	16
by	16
many	16
good	16
words	16
and	16
deeds,	16
your	16
worship’s	16
desire	16
to	16
show	16
me	16
favour;	16
and	16
if	16
I	16
have	16
been	16
bargaining	16
more	16
or	16
less	16
about	16
my	16
wages,	16
it	16
was	16
only	16
to	16
please	16
my	16
wife,	16
who,	16
when	16
she	16
sets	16
herself	16
to	16
press	16
a	16
point,	16
no	16
hammer	16
drives	16
the	16
hoops	16
of	16
a	16
cask	16
as	16
she	16
drives	16
one	16
to	16
do	16
what	16
she	16
wants;	16
but,	16
after	16
all,	16
a	16
man	16
must	16
be	16
a	16
man,	16
and	16
a	16
woman	16
a	16
woman;	16
and	16
as	16
I	16
am	16
a	16
man	16
anyhow,	16
which	16
I	16
can’t	16
deny,	16
I	16
will	16
be	16
one	16
in	16
my	16
own	16
house	16
too,	16
let	16
who	16
will	16
take	16
it	16
amiss;	16
and	16
so	16
there’s	16
nothing	16
more	16
to	16
do	16
but	16
for	16
your	16
worship	16
to	16
make	16
your	16
will	16
with	16
its	16
codicil	16
in	16
such	16
a	16
way	16
that	16
it	16
can’t	16
be	16
provoked,	16
and	16
let	16
us	16
set	16
out	16
at	16
once,	16
to	16
save	16
Señor	16
Samson’s	16
soul	16
from	16
suffering,	16
as	16
he	16
says	16
his	16
conscience	16
obliges	16
him	16
to	16
persuade	16
your	16
worship	16
to	16
sally	16
out	16
upon	16
the	16
world	16
a	16
third	16
time;	16
so	16
I	16
offer	16
again	16
to	16
serve	16
your	16
worship	16
faithfully	16
and	16
loyally,	16
as	16
well	16
and	16
better	16
than	16
all	16
the	16
squires	16
that	16
served	16
knights-errant	16
in	16
times	16
past	16
or	16
present.”	16
The	16
bachelor	16
was	16
filled	16
with	16
amazement	16
when	16
he	16
heard	16
Sancho’s	16
phraseology	16
and	16
style	16
of	16
talk,	16
for	16
though	16
he	16
had	16
read	16
the	16
first	16
part	16
of	16
his	16
master’s	16
history	16
he	16
never	16
thought	16
that	16
he	16
could	16
be	16
so	16
droll	16
as	16
he	16
was	16
there	16
described;	16
but	16
now,	16
hearing	16
him	16
talk	16
of	16
a	16
“will	16
and	16
codicil	16
that	16
could	16
not	16
be	16
provoked,”	16
instead	16
of	16
“will	16
and	16
codicil	16
that	16
could	16
not	16
be	16
revoked,”	16
he	16
believed	16
all	16
he	16
had	16
read	16
of	16
him,	16
and	16
set	16
him	16
down	16
as	16
one	16
of	16
the	16
greatest	16
simpletons	16
of	16
modern	16
times;	16
and	16
he	16
said	16
to	16
himself	16
that	16
two	16
such	16
lunatics	16
as	16
master	16
and	16
man	16
the	16
world	16
had	16
never	16
seen.	16
In	16
fine,	16
Don	16
Quixote	16
and	16
Sancho	16
embraced	16
one	16
another	16
and	16
made	16
friends,	16
and	16
by	16
the	16
advice	16
and	16
with	16
the	16
approval	16
of	16
the	16
great	16
Carrasco,	16
who	16
was	16
now	16
their	16
oracle,	16
it	16
was	16
arranged	16
that	16
their	16
departure	16
should	16
take	16
place	16
three	16
days	16
thence,	16
by	16
which	16
time	16
they	16
could	16
have	16
all	16
that	16
was	16
requisite	16
for	16
the	16
journey	16
ready,	16
and	16
procure	16
a	16
closed	16
helmet,	16
which	16
Don	16
Quixote	16
said	16
he	16
must	16
by	16
all	16
means	16
take.	16
Samson	16
offered	16
him	16
one,	16
as	16
he	16
knew	16
a	16
friend	16
of	16
his	16
who	16
had	16
it	16
would	16
not	16
refuse	16
it	16
to	16
him,	16
though	16
it	16
was	16
more	16
dingy	16
with	16
rust	16
and	16
mildew	16
than	16
bright	16
and	16
clean	16
like	16
burnished	16
steel.	16
The	16
curses	16
which	16
both	16
housekeeper	16
and	16
niece	16
poured	16
out	16
on	16
the	16
bachelor	16
were	16
past	16
counting;	16
they	16
tore	16
their	16
hair,	16
they	16
clawed	16
their	16
faces,	16
and	16
in	16
the	16
style	16
of	16
the	16
hired	16
mourners	16
that	16
were	16
once	16
in	16
fashion,	16
they	16
raised	16
a	16
lamentation	16
over	16
the	16
departure	16
of	16
their	16
master	16
and	16
uncle,	16
as	16
if	16
it	16
had	16
been	16
his	16
death.	16
Samson’s	16
intention	16
in	16
persuading	16
him	16
to	16
sally	16
forth	16
once	16
more	16
was	16
to	16
do	16
what	16
the	16
history	16
relates	16
farther	16
on;	16
all	16
by	16
the	16
advice	16
of	16
the	16
curate	16
and	16
barber,	16
with	16
whom	16
he	16
had	16
previously	16
discussed	16
the	16
subject.	16
Finally,	16
then,	16
during	16
those	16
three	16
days,	16
Don	16
Quixote	16
and	16
Sancho	16
provided	16
themselves	16
with	16
what	16
they	16
considered	16
necessary,	16
and	16
Sancho	16
having	16
pacified	16
his	16
wife,	16
and	16
Don	16
Quixote	16
his	16
niece	16
and	16
housekeeper,	16
at	16
nightfall,	16
unseen	16
by	16
anyone	16
except	16
the	16
bachelor,	16
who	16
thought	16
fit	16
to	16
accompany	16
them	16
half	16
a	16
league	16
out	16
of	16
the	16
village,	16
they	16
set	16
out	16
for	16
El	16
Toboso,	16
Don	16
Quixote	16
on	16
his	16
good	16
Rocinante	16
and	16
Sancho	16
on	16
his	16
old	16
Dapple,	16
his	16
alforjas	16
furnished	16
with	16
certain	16
matters	16
in	16
the	16
way	16
of	16
victuals,	16
and	16
his	16
purse	16
with	16
money	16
that	16
Don	16
Quixote	16
gave	16
him	16
to	16
meet	16
emergencies.	16
Samson	16
embraced	16
him,	16
and	16
entreated	16
him	16
to	16
let	16
him	16
hear	16
of	16
his	16
good	16
or	16
evil	16
fortunes,	16
so	16
that	16
he	16
might	16
rejoice	16
over	16
the	16
former	16
or	16
condole	16
with	16
him	16
over	16
the	16
latter,	16
as	16
the	16
laws	16
of	16
friendship	16
required.	16
Don	16
Quixote	16
promised	16
him	16
he	16
would	16
do	16
so,	16
and	16
Samson	16
returned	16
to	16
the	16
village,	16
and	16
the	16
other	16
two	16
took	16
the	16
road	16
for	16
the	16
great	16
city	16
of	16
El	16
Toboso.	16

“Blessed	16
be	16
Allah	16
the	16
all-powerful!”	16
says	16
Hamete	16
Benengeli	16
on	16
beginning	16
this	16
eighth	16
chapter;	16
“blessed	16
be	16
Allah!”	16
he	16
repeats	16
three	16
times;	16
and	16
he	16
says	16
he	16
utters	16
these	16
thanksgivings	16
at	16
seeing	16
that	16
he	16
has	16
now	16
got	16
Don	16
Quixote	16
and	16
Sancho	16
fairly	16
afield,	16
and	16
that	16
the	16
readers	16
of	16
his	16
delightful	16
history	16
may	16
reckon	16
that	16
the	16
achievements	16
and	16
humours	16
of	16
Don	16
Quixote	16
and	16
his	16
squire	16
are	16
now	16
about	16
to	16
begin;	16
and	16
he	16
urges	16
them	16
to	16
forget	16
the	16
former	16
chivalries	16
of	16
the	16
ingenious	16
gentleman	16
and	16
to	16
fix	16
their	16
eyes	16
on	16
those	16
that	16
are	16
to	16
come,	16
which	16
now	16
begin	16
on	16
the	16
road	16
to	16
El	16
Toboso,	16
as	16
the	16
others	16
began	16
on	16
the	16
plains	16
of	16
Montiel;	16
nor	16
is	16
it	16
much	16
that	16
he	16
asks	16
in	16
consideration	16
of	16
all	16
he	16
promises,	16
and	16
so	16
he	16
goes	16
on	16
to	16
say:	16
Don	16
Quixote	16
and	16
Sancho	16
were	16
left	16
alone,	16
and	16
the	16
moment	16
Samson	16
took	16
his	16
departure,	16
Rocinante	16
began	16
to	16
neigh,	16
and	16
Dapple	16
to	16
sigh,	16
which,	16
by	16
both	16
knight	16
and	16
squire,	16
was	16
accepted	16
as	16
a	16
good	16
sign	16
and	16
a	16
very	16
happy	16
omen;	16
though,	16
if	16
the	16
truth	16
is	16
to	16
be	16
told,	16
the	16
sighs	16
and	16
brays	16
of	16
Dapple	16
were	16
louder	16
than	16
the	16
neighings	16
of	16
the	16
hack,	16
from	16
which	16
Sancho	16
inferred	16
that	16
his	16
good	16
fortune	16
was	16
to	16
exceed	16
and	16
overtop	16
that	16
of	16
his	16
master,	16
building,	16
perhaps,	16
upon	16
some	16
judicial	16
astrology	16
that	16
he	16
may	16
have	16
known,	16
though	16
the	16
history	16
says	16
nothing	16
about	16
it;	16
all	16
that	16
can	16
be	16
said	16
is,	16
that	16
when	16
he	16
stumbled	16
or	16
fell,	16
he	16
was	16
heard	16
to	16
say	16
he	16
wished	16
he	16
had	16
not	16
come	16
out,	16
for	16
by	16
stumbling	16
or	16
falling	16
there	16
was	16
nothing	16
to	16
be	16
got	16
but	16
a	16
damaged	16
shoe	16
or	16
a	16
broken	16
rib;	16
and,	16
fool	16
as	16
he	16
was,	16
he	16
was	16
not	16
much	16
astray	16
in	16
this.	16
Said	16
Don	16
Quixote,	16
“Sancho,	16
my	16
friend,	16
night	16
is	16
drawing	16
on	16
upon	16
us	16
as	16
we	16
go,	16
and	16
more	16
darkly	16
than	16
will	16
allow	16
us	16
to	16
reach	16
El	16
Toboso	16
by	16
daylight;	16
for	16
there	16
I	16
am	16
resolved	16
to	16
go	16
before	16
I	16
engage	16
in	16
another	16
adventure,	16
and	16
there	16
I	16
shall	16
obtain	16
the	16
blessing	16
and	16
generous	16
permission	16
of	16
the	16
peerless	16
Dulcinea,	16
with	16
which	16
permission	16
I	16
expect	16
and	16
feel	16
assured	16
that	16
I	16
shall	16
conclude	16
and	16
bring	16
to	16
a	16
happy	16
termination	16
every	16
perilous	16
adventure;	16
for	16
nothing	16
in	16
life	16
makes	16
knights-errant	16
more	16
valorous	16
than	16
finding	16
themselves	16
favoured	16
by	16
their	16
ladies.”	16

“So	16
I	16
believe,”	16
replied	16
Sancho;	16
“but	16
I	16
think	16
it	16
will	16
be	16
difficult	16
for	16
your	16
worship	16
to	16
speak	16
with	16
her	16
or	16
see	16
her,	16
at	16
any	16
rate	16
where	16
you	16
will	16
be	16
able	16
to	16
receive	16
her	16
blessing;	16
unless,	16
indeed,	16
she	16
throws	16
it	16
over	16
the	16
wall	16
of	16
the	16
yard	16
where	16
I	16
saw	16
her	16
the	16
time	16
before,	16
when	16
I	16
took	16
her	16
the	16
letter	16
that	16
told	16
of	16
the	16
follies	16
and	16
mad	16
things	16
your	16
worship	16
was	16
doing	16
in	16
the	16
heart	16
of	16
Sierra	16
Morena.”	16
“Didst	16
thou	16
take	16
that	16
for	16
a	16
yard	16
wall,	16
Sancho,”	16
said	16
Don	16
Quixote,	16
“where	16
or	16
at	16
which	16
thou	16
sawest	16
that	16
never	16
sufficiently	16
extolled	16
grace	16
and	16
beauty?	16
It	16
must	16
have	16
been	16
the	16
gallery,	16
corridor,	16
or	16
portico	16
of	16
some	16
rich	16
and	16
royal	16
palace.”	16
“It	16
might	16
have	16
been	16
all	16
that,”	16
returned	16
Sancho,	16
“but	16
to	16
me	16
it	16
looked	16
like	16
a	16
wall,	16
unless	16
I	16
am	16
short	16
of	16
memory.”	16
“At	16
all	16
events,	16
let	16
us	16
go	16
there,	16
Sancho,”	16
said	16
Don	16
Quixote;	16
“for,	16
so	16
that	16
I	16
see	16
her,	16
it	16
is	16
the	16
same	16
to	16
me	16
whether	16
it	16
be	16
over	16
a	16
wall,	16
or	16
at	16
a	16
window,	16
or	16
through	16
the	16
chink	16
of	16
a	16
door,	16
or	16
the	16
grate	16
of	16
a	16
garden;	16
for	16
any	16
beam	16
of	16
the	16
sun	16
of	16
her	16
beauty	16
that	16
reaches	16
my	16
eyes	16
will	16
give	16
light	16
to	16
my	16
reason	16
and	16
strength	16
to	16
my	16
heart,	16
so	16
that	16
I	16
shall	16
be	16
unmatched	16
and	16
unequalled	16
in	16
wisdom	16
and	16
valour.”	16
“Well,	16
to	16
tell	16
the	16
truth,	16
señor,”	16
said	16
Sancho,	16
“when	16
I	16
saw	16
that	16
sun	16
of	16
the	16
lady	16
Dulcinea	16
del	16
Toboso,	16
it	16
was	16
not	16
bright	16
enough	16
to	16
throw	16
out	16
beams	16
at	16
all;	16
it	16
must	16
have	16
been,	16
that	16
as	16
her	16
grace	16
was	16
sifting	16
that	16
wheat	16
I	16
told	16
you	16
of,	16
the	16
thick	16
dust	16
she	16
raised	16
came	16
before	16
her	16
face	16
like	16
a	16
cloud	16
and	16
dimmed	16
it.”	16
“What!	16
dost	16
thou	16
still	16
persist,	16
Sancho,”	16
said	16
Don	16
Quixote,	16
“in	16
saying,	16
thinking,	16
believing,	16
and	16
maintaining	16
that	16
my	16
lady	16
Dulcinea	16
was	16
sifting	16
wheat,	16
that	16
being	16
an	16
occupation	16
and	16
task	16
entirely	16
at	16
variance	16
with	16
what	16
is	16
and	16
should	16
be	16
the	16
employment	16
of	16
persons	16
of	16
distinction,	16
who	16
are	16
constituted	16
and	16
reserved	16
for	16
other	16
avocations	16
and	16
pursuits	16
that	16
show	16
their	16
rank	16
a	16
bowshot	16
off?	16
Thou	16
hast	16
forgotten,	16
O	16
Sancho,	16
those	16
lines	16
of	16
our	16
poet	16
wherein	16
he	16
paints	16
for	16
us	16
how,	16
in	16
their	16
crystal	16
abodes,	16
those	16
four	16
nymphs	16
employed	16
themselves	16
who	16
rose	16
from	16
their	16
loved	16
Tagus	16
and	16
seated	16
themselves	16
in	16
a	16
verdant	16
meadow	16
to	16
embroider	16
those	16
tissues	16
which	16
the	16
ingenious	16
poet	16
there	16
describes	16
to	16
us,	16
how	16
they	16
were	16
worked	16
and	16
woven	16
with	16
gold	16
and	16
silk	16
and	16
pearls;	16
and	16
something	16
of	16
this	16
sort	16
must	16
have	16
been	16
the	16
employment	16
of	16
my	16
lady	16
when	16
thou	16
sawest	16
her,	16
only	16
that	16
the	16
spite	16
which	16
some	16
wicked	16
enchanter	16
seems	16
to	16
have	16
against	16
everything	16
of	16
mine	16
changes	16
all	16
those	16
things	16
that	16
give	16
me	16
pleasure,	16
and	16
turns	16
them	16
into	16
shapes	16
unlike	16
their	16
own;	16
and	16
so	16
I	16
fear	16
that	16
in	16
that	16
history	16
of	16
my	16
achievements	16
which	16
they	16
say	16
is	16
now	16
in	16
print,	16
if	16
haply	16
its	16
author	16
was	16
some	16
sage	16
who	16
is	16
an	16
enemy	16
of	16
mine,	16
he	16
will	16
have	16
put	16
one	16
thing	16
for	16
another,	16
mingling	16
a	16
thousand	16
lies	16
with	16
one	16
truth,	16
and	16
amusing	16
himself	16
by	16
relating	16
transactions	16
which	16
have	16
nothing	16
to	16
do	16
with	16
the	16
sequence	16
of	16
a	16
true	16
history.	16
O	16
envy,	16
root	16
of	16
all	16
countless	16
evils,	16
and	16
cankerworm	16
of	16
the	16
virtues!	16
All	16
the	16
vices,	16
Sancho,	16
bring	16
some	16
kind	16
of	16
pleasure	16
with	16
them;	16
but	16
envy	16
brings	16
nothing	16
but	16
irritation,	16
bitterness,	16
and	16
rage.”	16
“So	16
I	16
say	16
too,”	16
replied	16
Sancho;	16
“and	16
I	16
suspect	16
in	16
that	16
legend	16
or	16
history	16
of	16
us	16
that	16
the	16
bachelor	16
Samson	16
Carrasco	16
told	16
us	16
he	16
saw,	16
my	16
honour	16
goes	16
dragged	16
in	16
the	16
dirt,	16
knocked	16
about,	16
up	16
and	16
down,	16
sweeping	16
the	16
streets,	16
as	16
they	16
say.	16
And	16
yet,	16
on	16
the	16
faith	16
of	16
an	16
honest	16
man,	16
I	16
never	16
spoke	16
ill	16
of	16
any	16
enchanter,	16
and	16
I	16
am	16
not	16
so	16
well	16
off	16
that	16
I	16
am	16
to	16
be	16
envied;	16
to	16
be	16
sure,	16
I	16
am	16
rather	16
sly,	16
and	16
I	16
have	16
a	16
certain	16
spice	16
of	16
the	16
rogue	16
in	16
me;	16
but	16
all	16
is	16
covered	16
by	16
the	16
great	16
cloak	16
of	16
my	16
simplicity,	16
always	16
natural	16
and	16
never	16
acted;	16
and	16
if	16
I	16
had	16
no	16
other	16
merit	16
save	16
that	16
I	16
believe,	16
as	16
I	16
always	16
do,	16
firmly	16
and	16
truly	16
in	16
God,	16
and	16
all	16
the	16
holy	16
Roman	16
Catholic	16
Church	16
holds	16
and	16
believes,	16
and	16
that	16
I	16
am	16
a	16
mortal	16
enemy	16
of	16
the	16
Jews,	16
the	16
historians	16
ought	16
to	16
have	16
mercy	16
on	16
me	16
and	16
treat	16
me	16
well	16
in	16
their	16
writings.	16
But	16
let	16
them	16
say	16
what	16
they	16
like;	16
naked	16
was	16
I	16
born,	16
naked	16
I	16
find	16
myself,	16
I	16
neither	16
lose	16
nor	16
gain;	16
nay,	16
while	16
I	16
see	16
myself	16
put	16
into	16
a	16
book	16
and	16
passed	16
on	16
from	16
hand	16
to	16
hand	16
over	16
the	16
world,	16
I	16
don’t	16
care	16
a	16
fig,	16
let	16
them	16
say	16
what	16
they	16
like	16
of	16
me.”	16
“That,	16
Sancho,”	16
returned	16
Don	16
Quixote,	16
“reminds	16
me	16
of	16
what	16
happened	16
to	16
a	16
famous	16
poet	16
of	16
our	16
own	16
day,	16
who,	16
having	16
written	16
a	16
bitter	16
satire	16
against	16
all	16
the	16
courtesan	16
ladies,	16
did	16
not	16
insert	16
or	16
name	16
in	16
it	16
a	16
certain	16
lady	16
of	16
whom	16
it	16
was	16
questionable	16
whether	16
she	16
was	16
one	16
or	16
not.	16
She,	16
seeing	16
she	16
was	16
not	16
in	16
the	16
list	16
of	16
the	16
poet,	16
asked	16
him	16
what	16
he	16
had	16
seen	16
in	16
her	16
that	16
he	16
did	16
not	16
include	16
her	16
in	16
the	16
number	16
of	16
the	16
others,	16
telling	16
him	16
he	16
must	16
add	16
to	16
his	16
satire	16
and	16
put	16
her	16
in	16
the	16
new	16
part,	16
or	16
else	16
look	16
out	16
for	16
the	16
consequences.	16
The	16
poet	16
did	16
as	16
she	16
bade	16
him,	16
and	16
left	16
her	16
without	16
a	16
shred	16
of	16
reputation,	16
and	16
she	16
was	16
satisfied	16
by	16
getting	16
fame	16
though	16
it	16
was	16
infamy.	16
In	16
keeping	16
with	16
this	16
is	16
what	16
they	16
relate	16
of	16
that	16
shepherd	16
who	16
set	16
fire	16
to	16
the	16
famous	16
temple	16
of	16
Diana,	16
by	16
repute	16
one	16
of	16
the	16
seven	16
wonders	16
of	16
the	16
world,	16
and	16
burned	16
it	16
with	16
the	16
sole	16
object	16
of	16
making	16
his	16
name	16
live	16
in	16
after	16
ages;	16
and,	16
though	16
it	16
was	16
forbidden	16
to	16
name	16
him,	16
or	16
mention	16
his	16
name	16
by	16
word	16
of	16
mouth	16
or	16
in	16
writing,	16
lest	16
the	16
object	16
of	16
his	16
ambition	16
should	16
be	16
attained,	16
nevertheless	16
it	16
became	16
known	16
that	16
he	16
was	16
called	16
Erostratus.	16
And	16
something	16
of	16
the	16
same	16
sort	16
is	16
what	16
happened	16
in	16
the	16
case	16
of	16
the	16
great	16
emperor	16
Charles	16
V.	16
and	16
a	16
gentleman	16
in	16
Rome.	16
The	16
emperor	16
was	16
anxious	16
to	16
see	16
that	16
famous	16
temple	16
of	16
the	16
Rotunda,	16
called	16
in	16
ancient	16
times	16
the	16
temple	16
‘of	16
all	16
the	16
gods,’	16
but	16
now-a-days,	16
by	16
a	16
better	16
nomenclature,	16
‘of	16
all	16
the	16
saints,’	16
which	16
is	16
the	16
best	16
preserved	16
building	16
of	16
all	16
those	16
of	16
pagan	16
construction	16
in	16
Rome,	16
and	16
the	16
one	16
which	16
best	16
sustains	16
the	16
reputation	16
of	16
mighty	16
works	16
and	16
magnificence	16
of	16
its	16
founders.	16
It	16
is	16
in	16
the	16
form	16
of	16
a	16
half	16
orange,	16
of	16
enormous	16
dimensions,	16
and	16
well	16
lighted,	16
though	16
no	16
light	16
penetrates	16
it	16
save	16
that	16
which	16
is	16
admitted	16
by	16
a	16
window,	16
or	16
rather	16
round	16
skylight,	16
at	16
the	16
top;	16
and	16
it	16
was	16
from	16
this	16
that	16
the	16
emperor	16
examined	16
the	16
building.	16
A	16
Roman	16
gentleman	16
stood	16
by	16
his	16
side	16
and	16
explained	16
to	16
him	16
the	16
skilful	16
construction	16
and	16
ingenuity	16
of	16
the	16
vast	16
fabric	16
and	16
its	16
wonderful	16
architecture,	16
and	16
when	16
they	16
had	16
left	16
the	16
skylight	16
he	16
said	16
to	16
the	16
emperor,	16
‘A	16
thousand	16
times,	16
your	16
Sacred	16
Majesty,	16
the	16
impulse	16
came	16
upon	16
me	16
to	16
seize	16
your	16
Majesty	16
in	16
my	16
arms	16
and	16
fling	16
myself	16
down	16
from	16
yonder	16
skylight,	16
so	16
as	16
to	16
leave	16
behind	16
me	16
in	16
the	16
world	16
a	16
name	16
that	16
would	16
last	16
for	16
ever.’	16
‘I	16
am	16
thankful	16
to	16
you	16
for	16
not	16
carrying	16
such	16
an	16
evil	16
thought	16
into	16
effect,’	16
said	16
the	16
emperor,	16
‘and	16
I	16
shall	16
give	16
you	16
no	16
opportunity	16
in	16
future	16
of	16
again	16
putting	16
your	16
loyalty	16
to	16
the	16
test;	16
and	16
I	16
therefore	16
forbid	16
you	16
ever	16
to	16
speak	16
to	16
me	16
or	16
to	16
be	16
where	16
I	16
am;	16
and	16
he	16
followed	16
up	16
these	16
words	16
by	16
bestowing	16
a	16
liberal	16
bounty	16
upon	16
him.	16
My	16
meaning	16
is,	16
Sancho,	16
that	16
the	16
desire	16
of	16
acquiring	16
fame	16
is	16
a	16
very	16
powerful	16
motive.	16
What,	16
thinkest	16
thou,	16
was	16
it	16
that	16
flung	16
Horatius	16
in	16
full	16
armour	16
down	16
from	16
the	16
bridge	16
into	16
the	16
depths	16
of	16
the	16
Tiber?	16
What	16
burned	16
the	16
hand	16
and	16
arm	16
of	16
Mutius?	16
What	16
impelled	16
Curtius	16
to	16
plunge	16
into	16
the	16
deep	16
burning	16
gulf	16
that	16
opened	16
in	16
the	16
midst	16
of	16
Rome?	16
What,	16
in	16
opposition	16
to	16
all	16
the	16
omens	16
that	16
declared	16
against	16
him,	16
made	16
Julius	16
Cæsar	16
cross	16
the	16
Rubicon?	16
And	16
to	16
come	16
to	16
more	16
modern	16
examples,	16
what	16
scuttled	16
the	16
ships,	16
and	16
left	16
stranded	16
and	16
cut	16
off	16
the	16
gallant	16
Spaniards	16
under	16
the	16
command	16
of	16
the	16
most	16
courteous	16
Cortés	16
in	16
the	16
New	16
World?	16
All	16
these	16
and	16
a	16
variety	16
of	16
other	16
great	16
exploits	16
are,	16
were	16
and	16
will	16
be,	16
the	16
work	16
of	16
fame	16
that	16
mortals	16
desire	16
as	16
a	16
reward	16
and	16
a	16
portion	16
of	16
the	16
immortality	16
their	16
famous	16
deeds	16
deserve;	16
though	16
we	16
Catholic	16
Christians	16
and	16
knights-errant	16
look	16
more	16
to	16
that	16
future	16
glory	16
that	16
is	16
everlasting	16
in	16
the	16
ethereal	16
regions	16
of	16
heaven	16
than	16
to	16
the	16
vanity	16
of	16
the	16
fame	16
that	16
is	16
to	16
be	16
acquired	16
in	16
this	16
present	16
transitory	16
life;	16
a	16
fame	16
that,	16
however	16
long	16
it	16
may	16
last,	16
must	16
after	16
all	16
end	16
with	16
the	16
world	16
itself,	16
which	16
has	16
its	16
own	16
appointed	16
end.	16
So	16
that,	16
O	16
Sancho,	16
in	16
what	16
we	16
do	16
we	16
must	16
not	16
overpass	16
the	16
bounds	16
which	16
the	16
Christian	16
religion	16
we	16
profess	16
has	16
assigned	16
to	16
us.	16
We	16
have	16
to	16
slay	16
pride	16
in	16
giants,	16
envy	16
by	16
generosity	16
and	16
nobleness	16
of	16
heart,	16
anger	16
by	16
calmness	16
of	16
demeanour	16
and	16
equanimity,	16
gluttony	16
and	16
sloth	16
by	16
the	16
spareness	16
of	16
our	16
diet	16
and	16
the	16
length	16
of	16
our	16
vigils,	16
lust	16
and	16
lewdness	16
by	16
the	16
loyalty	16
we	16
preserve	16
to	16
those	16
whom	16
we	16
have	16
made	16
the	16
mistresses	16
of	16
our	16
thoughts,	16
indolence	16
by	16
traversing	16
the	16
world	16
in	16
all	16
directions	16
seeking	16
opportunities	16
of	16
making	16
ourselves,	16
besides	16
Christians,	16
famous	16
knights.	16
Such,	16
Sancho,	16
are	16
the	16
means	16
by	16
which	16
we	16
reach	16
those	16
extremes	16
of	16
praise	16
that	16
fair	16
fame	16
carries	16
with	16
it.”	16
“All	16
that	16
your	16
worship	16
has	16
said	16
so	16
far,”	16
said	16
Sancho,	16
“I	16
have	16
understood	16
quite	16
well;	16
but	16
still	16
I	16
would	16
be	16
glad	16
if	16
your	16
worship	16
would	16
dissolve	16
a	16
doubt	16
for	16
me,	16
which	16
has	16
just	16
this	16
minute	16
come	16
into	16
my	16
mind.”	16
“Solve,	16
thou	16
meanest,	16
Sancho,”	16
said	16
Don	16
Quixote;	16
“say	16
on,	16
in	16
God’s	16
name,	16
and	16
I	16
will	16
answer	16
as	16
well	16
as	16
I	16
can.”	16
“Tell	16
me,	16
señor,”	16
Sancho	16
went	16
on	16
to	16
say,	16
“those	16
Julys	16
or	16
Augusts,	16
and	16
all	16
those	16
venturous	16
knights	16
that	16
you	16
say	16
are	16
now	16
dead—where	16
are	16
they	16
now?”	16
“The	16
heathens,”	16
replied	16
Don	16
Quixote,	16
“are,	16
no	16
doubt,	16
in	16
hell;	16
the	16
Christians,	16
if	16
they	16
were	16
good	16
Christians,	16
are	16
either	16
in	16
purgatory	16
or	16
in	16
heaven.”	16
“Very	16
good,”	16
said	16
Sancho;	16
“but	16
now	16
I	16
want	16
to	16
know—the	16
tombs	16
where	16
the	16
bodies	16
of	16
those	16
great	16
lords	16
are,	16
have	16
they	16
silver	16
lamps	16
before	16
them,	16
or	16
are	16
the	16
walls	16
of	16
their	16
chapels	16
ornamented	16
with	16
crutches,	16
winding-sheets,	16
tresses	16
of	16
hair,	16
legs	16
and	16
eyes	16
in	16
wax?	16
Or	16
what	16
are	16
they	16
ornamented	16
with?”	16
To	16
which	16
Don	16
Quixote	16
made	16
answer:	16
“The	16
tombs	16
of	16
the	16
heathens	16
were	16
generally	16
sumptuous	16
temples;	16
the	16
ashes	16
of	16
Julius	16
Cæsar’s	16
body	16
were	16
placed	16
on	16
the	16
top	16
of	16
a	16
stone	16
pyramid	16
of	16
vast	16
size,	16
which	16
they	16
now	16
call	16
in	16
Rome	16
Saint	16
Peter’s	16
needle.	16
The	16
emperor	16
Hadrian	16
had	16
for	16
a	16
tomb	16
a	16
castle	16
as	16
large	16
as	16
a	16
good-sized	16
village,	16
which	16
they	16
called	16
the	16
_Moles	16
Adriani_,	16
and	16
is	16
now	16
the	16
castle	16
of	16
St.	16
Angelo	16
in	16
Rome.	16
The	16
queen	16
Artemisia	16
buried	16
her	16
husband	16
Mausolus	16
in	16
a	16
tomb	16
which	16
was	16
reckoned	16
one	16
of	16
the	16
seven	16
wonders	16
of	16
the	16
world;	16
but	16
none	16
of	16
these	16
tombs,	16
or	16
of	16
the	16
many	16
others	16
of	16
the	16
heathens,	16
were	16
ornamented	16
with	16
winding-sheets	16
or	16
any	16
of	16
those	16
other	16
offerings	16
and	16
tokens	16
that	16
show	16
that	16
they	16
who	16
are	16
buried	16
there	16
are	16
saints.”	16
“That’s	16
the	16
point	16
I’m	16
coming	16
to,”	16
said	16
Sancho;	16
“and	16
now	16
tell	16
me,	16
which	16
is	16
the	16
greater	16
work,	16
to	16
bring	16
a	16
dead	16
man	16
to	16
life	16
or	16
to	16
kill	16
a	16
giant?”	16
“The	16
answer	16
is	16
easy,”	16
replied	16
Don	16
Quixote;	16
“it	16
is	16
a	16
greater	16
work	16
to	16
bring	16
to	16
life	16
a	16
dead	16
man.”	16
“Now	16
I	16
have	16
got	16
you,”	16
said	16
Sancho;	16
“in	16
that	16
case	16
the	16
fame	16
of	16
them	16
who	16
bring	16
the	16
dead	16
to	16
life,	16
who	16
give	16
sight	16
to	16
the	16
blind,	16
cure	16
cripples,	16
restore	16
health	16
to	16
the	16
sick,	16
and	16
before	16
whose	16
tombs	16
there	16
are	16
lamps	16
burning,	16
and	16
whose	16
chapels	16
are	16
filled	16
with	16
devout	16
folk	16
on	16
their	16
knees	16
adoring	16
their	16
relics	16
be	16
a	16
better	16
fame	16
in	16
this	16
life	16
and	16
in	16
the	16
other	16
than	16
that	16
which	16
all	16
the	16
heathen	16
emperors	16
and	16
knights-errant	16
that	16
have	16
ever	16
been	16
in	16
the	16
world	16
have	16
left	16
or	16
may	16
leave	16
behind	16
them?”	16
“That	16
I	16
grant,	16
too,”	16
said	16
Don	16
Quixote.	16
“Then	16
this	16
fame,	16
these	16
favours,	16
these	16
privileges,	16
or	16
whatever	16
you	16
call	16
it,”	16
said	16
Sancho,	16
“belong	16
to	16
the	16
bodies	16
and	16
relics	16
of	16
the	16
saints	16
who,	16
with	16
the	16
approbation	16
and	16
permission	16
of	16
our	16
holy	16
mother	16
Church,	16
have	16
lamps,	16
tapers,	16
winding-sheets,	16
crutches,	16
pictures,	16
eyes	16
and	16
legs,	16
by	16
means	16
of	16
which	16
they	16
increase	16
devotion	16
and	16
add	16
to	16
their	16
own	16
Christian	16
reputation.	16
Kings	16
carry	16
the	16
bodies	16
or	16
relics	16
of	16
saints	16
on	16
their	16
shoulders,	16
and	16
kiss	16
bits	16
of	16
their	16
bones,	16
and	16
enrich	16
and	16
adorn	16
their	16
oratories	16
and	16
favourite	16
altars	16
with	16
them.”	16
“What	16
wouldst	16
thou	16
have	16
me	16
infer	16
from	16
all	16
thou	16
hast	16
said,	16
Sancho?”	16
asked	16
Don	16
Quixote.	16
“My	16
meaning	16
is,”	16
said	16
Sancho,	16
“let	16
us	16
set	16
about	16
becoming	16
saints,	16
and	16
we	16
shall	16
obtain	16
more	16
quickly	16
the	16
fair	16
fame	16
we	16
are	16
striving	16
after;	16
for	16
you	16
know,	16
señor,	16
yesterday	16
or	16
the	16
day	16
before	16
yesterday	16
(for	16
it	16
is	16
so	16
lately	16
one	16
may	16
say	16
so)	16
they	16
canonised	16
and	16
beatified	16
two	16
little	16
barefoot	16
friars,	16
and	16
it	16
is	16
now	16
reckoned	16
the	16
greatest	16
good	16
luck	16
to	16
kiss	16
or	16
touch	16
the	16
iron	16
chains	16
with	16
which	16
they	16
girt	16
and	16
tortured	16
their	16
bodies,	16
and	16
they	16
are	16
held	16
in	16
greater	16
veneration,	16
so	16
it	16
is	16
said,	16
than	16
the	16
sword	16
of	16
Roland	16
in	16
the	16
armoury	16
of	16
our	16
lord	16
the	16
King,	16
whom	16
God	16
preserve.	16
So	16
that,	16
señor,	16
it	16
is	16
better	16
to	16
be	16
an	16
humble	16
little	16
friar	16
of	16
no	16
matter	16
what	16
order,	16
than	16
a	16
valiant	16
knight-errant;	16
with	16
God	16
a	16
couple	16
of	16
dozen	16
of	16
penance	16
lashings	16
are	16
of	16
more	16
avail	16
than	16
two	16
thousand	16
lance-thrusts,	16
be	16
they	16
given	16
to	16
giants,	16
or	16
monsters,	16
or	16
dragons.”	16
“All	16
that	16
is	16
true,”	16
returned	16
Don	16
Quixote,	16
“but	16
we	16
cannot	16
all	16
be	16
friars,	16
and	16
many	16
are	16
the	16
ways	16
by	16
which	16
God	16
takes	16
his	16
own	16
to	16
heaven;	16
chivalry	16
is	16
a	16
religion,	16
there	16
are	16
sainted	16
knights	16
in	16
glory.”	16
“Yes,”	16
said	16
Sancho,	16
“but	16
I	16
have	16
heard	16
say	16
that	16
there	16
are	16
more	16
friars	16
in	16
heaven	16
than	16
knights-errant.”	16
“That,”	16
said	16
Don	16
Quixote,	16
“is	16
because	16
those	16
in	16
religious	16
orders	16
are	16
more	16
numerous	16
than	16
knights.”	16
“The	16
errants	16
are	16
many,”	16
said	16
Sancho.	16
“Many,”	16
replied	16
Don	16
Quixote,	16
“but	16
few	16
they	16
who	16
deserve	16
the	16
name	16
of	16
knights.”	16
With	16
these,	16
and	16
other	16
discussions	16
of	16
the	16
same	16
sort,	16
they	16
passed	16
that	16
night	16
and	16
the	16
following	16
day,	16
without	16
anything	16
worth	16
mention	16
happening	16
to	16
them,	16
whereat	16
Don	16
Quixote	16
was	16
not	16
a	16
little	16
dejected;	16
but	16
at	16
length	16
the	16
next	16
day,	16
at	16
daybreak,	16
they	16
descried	16
the	16
great	16
city	16
of	16
El	16
Toboso,	16
at	16
the	16
sight	16
of	16
which	16
Don	16
Quixote’s	16
spirits	16
rose	16
and	16
Sancho’s	16
fell,	16
for	16
he	16
did	16
not	16
know	16
Dulcinea’s	16
house,	16
nor	16
in	16
all	16
his	16
life	16
had	16
he	16
ever	16
seen	16
her,	16
any	16
more	16
than	16
his	16
master;	16
so	16
that	16
they	16
were	16
both	16
uneasy,	16
the	16
one	16
to	16
see	16
her,	16
the	16
other	16
at	16
not	16
having	16
seen	16
her,	16
and	16
Sancho	16
was	16
at	16
a	16
loss	16
to	16
know	16
what	16
he	16
was	16
to	16
do	16
when	16
his	16
master	16
sent	16
him	16
to	16
El	16
Toboso.	16
In	16
the	16
end,	16
Don	16
Quixote	16
made	16
up	16
his	16
mind	16
to	16
enter	16
the	16
city	16
at	16
nightfall,	16
and	16
they	16
waited	16
until	16
the	16
time	16
came	16
among	16
some	16
oak	16
trees	16
that	16
were	16
near	16
El	16
Toboso;	16
and	16
when	16
the	16
moment	16
they	16
had	16
agreed	16
upon	16
arrived,	16
they	16
made	16
their	16
entrance	16
into	16
the	16
city,	16
where	16
something	16
happened	16
them	16
that	16
may	16
fairly	16
be	16
called	16
something.	16

’Twas	16
at	16
the	16
very	16
midnight	16
hour—more	16
or	16
less—when	16
Don	16
Quixote	16
and	16
Sancho	16
quitted	16
the	16
wood	16
and	16
entered	16
El	16
Toboso.	16
The	16
town	16
was	16
in	16
deep	16
silence,	16
for	16
all	16
the	16
inhabitants	16
were	16
asleep,	16
and	16
stretched	16
on	16
the	16
broad	16
of	16
their	16
backs,	16
as	16
the	16
saying	16
is.	16
The	16
night	16
was	16
darkish,	16
though	16
Sancho	16
would	16
have	16
been	16
glad	16
had	16
it	16
been	16
quite	16
dark,	16
so	16
as	16
to	16
find	16
in	16
the	16
darkness	16
an	16
excuse	16
for	16
his	16
blundering.	16
All	16
over	16
the	16
place	16
nothing	16
was	16
to	16
be	16
heard	16
except	16
the	16
barking	16
of	16
dogs,	16
which	16
deafened	16
the	16
ears	16
of	16
Don	16
Quixote	16
and	16
troubled	16
the	16
heart	16
of	16
Sancho.	16
Now	16
and	16
then	16
an	16
ass	16
brayed,	16
pigs	16
grunted,	16
cats	16
mewed,	16
and	16
the	16
various	16
noises	16
they	16
made	16
seemed	16
louder	16
in	16
the	16
silence	16
of	16
the	16
night;	16
all	16
which	16
the	16
enamoured	16
knight	16
took	16
to	16
be	16
of	16
evil	16
omen;	16
nevertheless	16
he	16
said	16
to	16
Sancho,	16
“Sancho,	16
my	16
son,	16
lead	16
on	16
to	16
the	16
palace	16
of	16
Dulcinea,	16
it	16
may	16
be	16
that	16
we	16
shall	16
find	16
her	16
awake.”	16
“Body	16
of	16
the	16
sun!	16
what	16
palace	16
am	16
I	16
to	16
lead	16
to,”	16
said	16
Sancho,	16
“when	16
what	16
I	16
saw	16
her	16
highness	16
in	16
was	16
only	16
a	16
very	16
little	16
house?”	16
“Most	16
likely	16
she	16
had	16
then	16
withdrawn	16
into	16
some	16
small	16
apartment	16
of	16
her	16
palace,”	16
said	16
Don	16
Quixote,	16
“to	16
amuse	16
herself	16
with	16
damsels,	16
as	16
great	16
ladies	16
and	16
princesses	16
are	16
accustomed	16
to	16
do.”	16
“Señor,”	16
said	16
Sancho,	16
“if	16
your	16
worship	16
will	16
have	16
it	16
in	16
spite	16
of	16
me	16
that	16
the	16
house	16
of	16
my	16
lady	16
Dulcinea	16
is	16
a	16
palace,	16
is	16
this	16
an	16
hour,	16
think	16
you,	16
to	16
find	16
the	16
door	16
open;	16
and	16
will	16
it	16
be	16
right	16
for	16
us	16
to	16
go	16
knocking	16
till	16
they	16
hear	16
us	16
and	16
open	16
the	16
door;	16
making	16
a	16
disturbance	16
and	16
confusion	16
all	16
through	16
the	16
household?	16
Are	16
we	16
going,	16
do	16
you	16
fancy,	16
to	16
the	16
house	16
of	16
our	16
wenches,	16
like	16
gallants	16
who	16
come	16
and	16
knock	16
and	16
go	16
in	16
at	16
any	16
hour,	16
however	16
late	16
it	16
may	16
be?”	16
“Let	16
us	16
first	16
of	16
all	16
find	16
out	16
the	16
palace	16
for	16
certain,”	16
replied	16
Don	16
Quixote,	16
“and	16
then	16
I	16
will	16
tell	16
thee,	16
Sancho,	16
what	16
we	16
had	16
best	16
do;	16
but	16
look,	16
Sancho,	16
for	16
either	16
I	16
see	16
badly,	16
or	16
that	16
dark	16
mass	16
that	16
one	16
sees	16
from	16
here	16
should	16
be	16
Dulcinea’s	16
palace.”	16
“Then	16
let	16
your	16
worship	16
lead	16
the	16
way,”	16
said	16
Sancho,	16
“perhaps	16
it	16
may	16
be	16
so;	16
though	16
I	16
see	16
it	16
with	16
my	16
eyes	16
and	16
touch	16
it	16
with	16
my	16
hands,	16
I’ll	16
believe	16
it	16
as	16
much	16
as	16
I	16
believe	16
it	16
is	16
daylight	16
now.”	16
Don	16
Quixote	16
took	16
the	16
lead,	16
and	16
having	16
gone	16
a	16
matter	16
of	16
two	16
hundred	16
paces	16
he	16
came	16
upon	16
the	16
mass	16
that	16
produced	16
the	16
shade,	16
and	16
found	16
it	16
was	16
a	16
great	16
tower,	16
and	16
then	16
he	16
perceived	16
that	16
the	16
building	16
in	16
question	16
was	16
no	16
palace,	16
but	16
the	16
chief	16
church	16
of	16
the	16
town,	16
and	16
said	16
he,	16
“It’s	16
the	16
church	16
we	16
have	16
lit	16
upon,	16
Sancho.”	16
“So	16
I	16
see,”	16
said	16
Sancho,	16
“and	16
God	16
grant	16
we	16
may	16
not	16
light	16
upon	16
our	16
graves;	16
it	16
is	16
no	16
good	16
sign	16
to	16
find	16
oneself	16
wandering	16
in	16
a	16
graveyard	16
at	16
this	16
time	16
of	16
night;	16
and	16
that,	16
after	16
my	16
telling	16
your	16
worship,	16
if	16
I	16
don’t	16
mistake,	16
that	16
the	16
house	16
of	16
this	16
lady	16
will	16
be	16
in	16
an	16
alley	16
without	16
an	16
outlet.”	16
“The	16
curse	16
of	16
God	16
on	16
thee	16
for	16
a	16
blockhead!”	16
said	16
Don	16
Quixote;	16
“where	16
hast	16
thou	16
ever	16
heard	16
of	16
castles	16
and	16
royal	16
palaces	16
being	16
built	16
in	16
alleys	16
without	16
an	16
outlet?”	16
“Señor,”	16
replied	16
Sancho,	16
“every	16
country	16
has	16
a	16
way	16
of	16
its	16
own;	16
perhaps	16
here	16
in	16
El	16
Toboso	16
it	16
is	16
the	16
way	16
to	16
build	16
palaces	16
and	16
grand	16
buildings	16
in	16
alleys;	16
so	16
I	16
entreat	16
your	16
worship	16
to	16
let	16
me	16
search	16
about	16
among	16
these	16
streets	16
or	16
alleys	16
before	16
me,	16
and	16
perhaps,	16
in	16
some	16
corner	16
or	16
other,	16
I	16
may	16
stumble	16
on	16
this	16
palace—and	16
I	16
wish	16
I	16
saw	16
the	16
dogs	16
eating	16
it	16
for	16
leading	16
us	16
such	16
a	16
dance.”	16
“Speak	16
respectfully	16
of	16
what	16
belongs	16
to	16
my	16
lady,	16
Sancho,”	16
said	16
Don	16
Quixote;	16
“let	16
us	16
keep	16
the	16
feast	16
in	16
peace,	16
and	16
not	16
throw	16
the	16
rope	16
after	16
the	16
bucket.”	16
“I’ll	16
hold	16
my	16
tongue,”	16
said	16
Sancho,	16
“but	16
how	16
am	16
I	16
to	16
take	16
it	16
patiently	16
when	16
your	16
worship	16
wants	16
me,	16
with	16
only	16
once	16
seeing	16
the	16
house	16
of	16
our	16
mistress,	16
to	16
know	16
always,	16
and	16
find	16
it	16
in	16
the	16
middle	16
of	16
the	16
night,	16
when	16
your	16
worship	16
can’t	16
find	16
it,	16
who	16
must	16
have	16
seen	16
it	16
thousands	16
of	16
times?”	16
“Thou	16
wilt	16
drive	16
me	16
to	16
desperation,	16
Sancho,”	16
said	16
Don	16
Quixote.	16
“Look	16
here,	16
heretic,	16
have	16
I	16
not	16
told	16
thee	16
a	16
thousand	16
times	16
that	16
I	16
have	16
never	16
once	16
in	16
my	16
life	16
seen	16
the	16
peerless	16
Dulcinea	16
or	16
crossed	16
the	16
threshold	16
of	16
her	16
palace,	16
and	16
that	16
I	16
am	16
enamoured	16
solely	16
by	16
hearsay	16
and	16
by	16
the	16
great	16
reputation	16
she	16
bears	16
for	16
beauty	16
and	16
discretion?”	16
“I	16
hear	16
it	16
now,”	16
returned	16
Sancho;	16
“and	16
I	16
may	16
tell	16
you	16
that	16
if	16
you	16
have	16
not	16
seen	16
her,	16
no	16
more	16
have	16
I.”	16
“That	16
cannot	16
be,”	16
said	16
Don	16
Quixote,	16
“for,	16
at	16
any	16
rate,	16
thou	16
saidst,	16
on	16
bringing	16
back	16
the	16
answer	16
to	16
the	16
letter	16
I	16
sent	16
by	16
thee,	16
that	16
thou	16
sawest	16
her	16
sifting	16
wheat.”	16
“Don’t	16
mind	16
that,	16
señor,”	16
said	16
Sancho;	16
“I	16
must	16
tell	16
you	16
that	16
my	16
seeing	16
her	16
and	16
the	16
answer	16
I	16
brought	16
you	16
back	16
were	16
by	16
hearsay	16
too,	16
for	16
I	16
can	16
no	16
more	16
tell	16
who	16
the	16
lady	16
Dulcinea	16
is	16
than	16
I	16
can	16
hit	16
the	16
sky.”	16
“Sancho,	16
Sancho,”	16
said	16
Don	16
Quixote,	16
“there	16
are	16
times	16
for	16
jests	16
and	16
times	16
when	16
jests	16
are	16
out	16
of	16
place;	16
if	16
I	16
tell	16
thee	16
that	16
I	16
have	16
neither	16
seen	16
nor	16
spoken	16
to	16
the	16
lady	16
of	16
my	16
heart,	16
it	16
is	16
no	16
reason	16
why	16
thou	16
shouldst	16
say	16
thou	16
hast	16
not	16
spoken	16
to	16
her	16
or	16
seen	16
her,	16
when	16
the	16
contrary	16
is	16
the	16
case,	16
as	16
thou	16
well	16
knowest.”	16
While	16
the	16
two	16
were	16
engaged	16
in	16
this	16
conversation,	16
they	16
perceived	16
someone	16
with	16
a	16
pair	16
of	16
mules	16
approaching	16
the	16
spot	16
where	16
they	16
stood,	16
and	16
from	16
the	16
noise	16
the	16
plough	16
made,	16
as	16
it	16
dragged	16
along	16
the	16
ground,	16
they	16
guessed	16
him	16
to	16
be	16
some	16
labourer	16
who	16
had	16
got	16
up	16
before	16
daybreak	16
to	16
go	16
to	16
his	16
work,	16
and	16
so	16
it	16
proved	16
to	16
be.	16
He	16
came	16
along	16
singing	16
the	16
ballad	16
that	16
says-	16
Ill	16
did	16
ye	16
fare,	16
ye	16
men	16
of	16
France,	16
In	16
Roncesvalles	16
chase-	16
“May	16
I	16
die,	16
Sancho,”	16
said	16
Don	16
Quixote,	16
when	16
he	16
heard	16
him,	16
“if	16
any	16
good	16
will	16
come	16
to	16
us	16
to-night!	16
Dost	16
thou	16
not	16
hear	16
what	16
that	16
clown	16
is	16
singing?”	16
“I	16
do,”	16
said	16
Sancho,	16
“but	16
what	16
has	16
Roncesvalles	16
chase	16
to	16
do	16
with	16
what	16
we	16
have	16
in	16
hand?	16
He	16
might	16
just	16
as	16
well	16
be	16
singing	16
the	16
ballad	16
of	16
Calainos,	16
for	16
any	16
good	16
or	16
ill	16
that	16
can	16
come	16
to	16
us	16
in	16
our	16
business.”	16
By	16
this	16
time	16
the	16
labourer	16
had	16
come	16
up,	16
and	16
Don	16
Quixote	16
asked	16
him,	16
“Can	16
you	16
tell	16
me,	16
worthy	16
friend,	16
and	16
God	16
speed	16
you,	16
whereabouts	16
here	16
is	16
the	16
palace	16
of	16
the	16
peerless	16
princess	16
Doña	16
Dulcinea	16
del	16
Toboso?”	16
“Señor,”	16
replied	16
the	16
lad,	16
“I	16
am	16
a	16
stranger,	16
and	16
I	16
have	16
been	16
only	16
a	16
few	16
days	16
in	16
the	16
town,	16
doing	16
farm	16
work	16
for	16
a	16
rich	16
farmer.	16
In	16
that	16
house	16
opposite	16
there	16
live	16
the	16
curate	16
of	16
the	16
village	16
and	16
the	16
sacristan,	16
and	16
both	16
or	16
either	16
of	16
them	16
will	16
be	16
able	16
to	16
give	16
your	16
worship	16
some	16
account	16
of	16
this	16
lady	16
princess,	16
for	16
they	16
have	16
a	16
list	16
of	16
all	16
the	16
people	16
of	16
El	16
Toboso;	16
though	16
it	16
is	16
my	16
belief	16
there	16
is	16
not	16
a	16
princess	16
living	16
in	16
the	16
whole	16
of	16
it;	16
many	16
ladies	16
there	16
are,	16
of	16
quality,	16
and	16
in	16
her	16
own	16
house	16
each	16
of	16
them	16
may	16
be	16
a	16
princess.”	16
“Well,	16
then,	16
she	16
I	16
am	16
inquiring	16
for	16
will	16
be	16
one	16
of	16
these,	16
my	16
friend,”	16
said	16
Don	16
Quixote.	16
“May	16
be	16
so,”	16
replied	16
the	16
lad;	16
“God	16
be	16
with	16
you,	16
for	16
here	16
comes	16
the	16
daylight;”	16
and	16
without	16
waiting	16
for	16
any	16
more	16
of	16
his	16
questions,	16
he	16
whipped	16
on	16
his	16
mules.	16
Sancho,	16
seeing	16
his	16
master	16
downcast	16
and	16
somewhat	16
dissatisfied,	16
said	16
to	16
him,	16
“Señor,	16
daylight	16
will	16
be	16
here	16
before	16
long,	16
and	16
it	16
will	16
not	16
do	16
for	16
us	16
to	16
let	16
the	16
sun	16
find	16
us	16
in	16
the	16
street;	16
it	16
will	16
be	16
better	16
for	16
us	16
to	16
quit	16
the	16
city,	16
and	16
for	16
your	16
worship	16
to	16
hide	16
in	16
some	16
forest	16
in	16
the	16
neighbourhood,	16
and	16
I	16
will	16
come	16
back	16
in	16
the	16
daytime,	16
and	16
I	16
won’t	16
leave	16
a	16
nook	16
or	16
corner	16
of	16
the	16
whole	16
village	16
that	16
I	16
won’t	16
search	16
for	16
the	16
house,	16
castle,	16
or	16
palace,	16
of	16
my	16
lady,	16
and	16
it	16
will	16
be	16
hard	16
luck	16
for	16
me	16
if	16
I	16
don’t	16
find	16
it;	16
and	16
as	16
soon	16
as	16
I	16
have	16
found	16
it	16
I	16
will	16
speak	16
to	16
her	16
grace,	16
and	16
tell	16
her	16
where	16
and	16
how	16
your	16
worship	16
is	16
waiting	16
for	16
her	16
to	16
arrange	16
some	16
plan	16
for	16
you	16
to	16
see	16
her	16
without	16
any	16
damage	16
to	16
her	16
honour	16
and	16
reputation.”	16
“Sancho,”	16
said	16
Don	16
Quixote,	16
“thou	16
hast	16
delivered	16
a	16
thousand	16
sentences	16
condensed	16
in	16
the	16
compass	16
of	16
a	16
few	16
words;	16
I	16
thank	16
thee	16
for	16
the	16
advice	16
thou	16
hast	16
given	16
me,	16
and	16
take	16
it	16
most	16
gladly.	16
Come,	16
my	16
son,	16
let	16
us	16
go	16
look	16
for	16
some	16
place	16
where	16
I	16
may	16
hide,	16
while	16
thou	16
dost	16
return,	16
as	16
thou	16
sayest,	16
to	16
seek,	16
and	16
speak	16
with	16
my	16
lady,	16
from	16
whose	16
discretion	16
and	16
courtesy	16
I	16
look	16
for	16
favours	16
more	16
than	16
miraculous.”	16
Sancho	16
was	16
in	16
a	16
fever	16
to	16
get	16
his	16
master	16
out	16
of	16
the	16
town,	16
lest	16
he	16
should	16
discover	16
the	16
falsehood	16
of	16
the	16
reply	16
he	16
had	16
brought	16
to	16
him	16
in	16
the	16
Sierra	16
Morena	16
on	16
behalf	16
of	16
Dulcinea;	16
so	16
he	16
hastened	16
their	16
departure,	16
which	16
they	16
took	16
at	16
once,	16
and	16
two	16
miles	16
out	16
of	16
the	16
village	16
they	16
found	16
a	16
forest	16
or	16
thicket	16
wherein	16
Don	16
Quixote	16
ensconced	16
himself,	16
while	16
Sancho	16
returned	16
to	16
the	16
city	16
to	16
speak	16
to	16
Dulcinea,	16
in	16
which	16
embassy	16
things	16
befell	16
him	16
which	16
demand	16
fresh	16
attention	16
and	16

When	16
the	16
author	16
of	16
this	16
great	16
history	16
comes	16
to	16
relate	16
what	16
is	16
set	16
down	16
in	16
this	16
chapter	16
he	16
says	16
he	16
would	16
have	16
preferred	16
to	16
pass	16
it	16
over	16
in	16
silence,	16
fearing	16
it	16
would	16
not	16
be	16
believed,	16
because	16
here	16
Don	16
Quixote’s	16
madness	16
reaches	16
the	16
confines	16
of	16
the	16
greatest	16
that	16
can	16
be	16
conceived,	16
and	16
even	16
goes	16
a	16
couple	16
of	16
bowshots	16
beyond	16
the	16
greatest.	16
But	16
after	16
all,	16
though	16
still	16
under	16
the	16
same	16
fear	16
and	16
apprehension,	16
he	16
has	16
recorded	16
it	16
without	16
adding	16
to	16
the	16
story	16
or	16
leaving	16
out	16
a	16
particle	16
of	16
the	16
truth,	16
and	16
entirely	16
disregarding	16
the	16
charges	16
of	16
falsehood	16
that	16
might	16
be	16
brought	16
against	16
him;	16
and	16
he	16
was	16
right,	16
for	16
the	16
truth	16
may	16
run	16
fine	16
but	16
will	16
not	16
break,	16
and	16
always	16
rises	16
above	16
falsehood	16
as	16
oil	16
above	16
water;	16
and	16
so,	16
going	16
on	16
with	16
his	16
story,	16
he	16
says	16
that	16
as	16
soon	16
as	16
Don	16
Quixote	16
had	16
ensconced	16
himself	16
in	16
the	16
forest,	16
oak	16
grove,	16
or	16
wood	16
near	16
El	16
Toboso,	16
he	16
bade	16
Sancho	16
return	16
to	16
the	16
city,	16
and	16
not	16
come	16
into	16
his	16
presence	16
again	16
without	16
having	16
first	16
spoken	16
on	16
his	16
behalf	16
to	16
his	16
lady,	16
and	16
begged	16
of	16
her	16
that	16
it	16
might	16
be	16
her	16
good	16
pleasure	16
to	16
permit	16
herself	16
to	16
be	16
seen	16
by	16
her	16
enslaved	16
knight,	16
and	16
deign	16
to	16
bestow	16
her	16
blessing	16
upon	16
him,	16
so	16
that	16
he	16
might	16
thereby	16
hope	16
for	16
a	16
happy	16
issue	16
in	16
all	16
his	16
encounters	16
and	16
difficult	16
enterprises.	16
Sancho	16
undertook	16
to	16
execute	16
the	16
task	16
according	16
to	16
the	16
instructions,	16
and	16
to	16
bring	16
back	16
an	16
answer	16
as	16
good	16
as	16
the	16
one	16
he	16
brought	16
back	16
before.	16
“Go,	16
my	16
son,”	16
said	16
Don	16
Quixote,	16
“and	16
be	16
not	16
dazed	16
when	16
thou	16
findest	16
thyself	16
exposed	16
to	16
the	16
light	16
of	16
that	16
sun	16
of	16
beauty	16
thou	16
art	16
going	16
to	16
seek.	16
Happy	16
thou,	16
above	16
all	16
the	16
squires	16
in	16
the	16
world!	16
Bear	16
in	16
mind,	16
and	16
let	16
it	16
not	16
escape	16
thy	16
memory,	16
how	16
she	16
receives	16
thee;	16
if	16
she	16
changes	16
colour	16
while	16
thou	16
art	16
giving	16
her	16
my	16
message;	16
if	16
she	16
is	16
agitated	16
and	16
disturbed	16
at	16
hearing	16
my	16
name;	16
if	16
she	16
cannot	16
rest	16
upon	16
her	16
cushion,	16
shouldst	16
thou	16
haply	16
find	16
her	16
seated	16
in	16
the	16
sumptuous	16
state	16
chamber	16
proper	16
to	16
her	16
rank;	16
and	16
should	16
she	16
be	16
standing,	16
observe	16
if	16
she	16
poises	16
herself	16
now	16
on	16
one	16
foot,	16
now	16
on	16
the	16
other;	16
if	16
she	16
repeats	16
two	16
or	16
three	16
times	16
the	16
reply	16
she	16
gives	16
thee;	16
if	16
she	16
passes	16
from	16
gentleness	16
to	16
austerity,	16
from	16
asperity	16
to	16
tenderness;	16
if	16
she	16
raises	16
her	16
hand	16
to	16
smooth	16
her	16
hair	16
though	16
it	16
be	16
not	16
disarranged.	16
In	16
short,	16
my	16
son,	16
observe	16
all	16
her	16
actions	16
and	16
motions,	16
for	16
if	16
thou	16
wilt	16
report	16
them	16
to	16
me	16
as	16
they	16
were,	16
I	16
will	16
gather	16
what	16
she	16
hides	16
in	16
the	16
recesses	16
of	16
her	16
heart	16
as	16
regards	16
my	16
love;	16
for	16
I	16
would	16
have	16
thee	16
know,	16
Sancho,	16
if	16
thou	16
knowest	16
it	16
not,	16
that	16
with	16
lovers	16
the	16
outward	16
actions	16
and	16
motions	16
they	16
give	16
way	16
to	16
when	16
their	16
loves	16
are	16
in	16
question	16
are	16
the	16
faithful	16
messengers	16
that	16
carry	16
the	16
news	16
of	16
what	16
is	16
going	16
on	16
in	16
the	16
depths	16
of	16
their	16
hearts.	16
Go,	16
my	16
friend,	16
may	16
better	16
fortune	16
than	16
mine	16
attend	16
thee,	16
and	16
bring	16
thee	16
a	16
happier	16
issue	16
than	16
that	16
which	16
I	16
await	16
in	16
dread	16
in	16
this	16
dreary	16
solitude.”	16
“I	16
will	16
go	16
and	16
return	16
quickly,”	16
said	16
Sancho;	16
“cheer	16
up	16
that	16
little	16
heart	16
of	16
yours,	16
master	16
mine,	16
for	16
at	16
the	16
present	16
moment	16
you	16
seem	16
to	16
have	16
got	16
one	16
no	16
bigger	16
than	16
a	16
hazel	16
nut;	16
remember	16
what	16
they	16
say,	16
that	16
a	16
stout	16
heart	16
breaks	16
bad	16
luck,	16
and	16
that	16
where	16
there	16
are	16
no	16
fletches	16
there	16
are	16
no	16
pegs;	16
and	16
moreover	16
they	16
say,	16
the	16
hare	16
jumps	16
up	16
where	16
it’s	16
not	16
looked	16
for.	16
I	16
say	16
this	16
because,	16
if	16
we	16
could	16
not	16
find	16
my	16
lady’s	16
palaces	16
or	16
castles	16
to-night,	16
now	16
that	16
it	16
is	16
daylight	16
I	16
count	16
upon	16
finding	16
them	16
when	16
I	16
least	16
expect	16
it,	16
and	16
once	16
found,	16
leave	16
it	16
to	16
me	16
to	16
manage	16
her.”	16
“Verily,	16
Sancho,”	16
said	16
Don	16
Quixote,	16
“thou	16
dost	16
always	16
bring	16
in	16
thy	16
proverbs	16
happily,	16
whatever	16
we	16
deal	16
with;	16
may	16
God	16
give	16
me	16
better	16
luck	16
in	16
what	16
I	16
am	16
anxious	16
about.”	16
With	16
this,	16
Sancho	16
wheeled	16
about	16
and	16
gave	16
Dapple	16
the	16
stick,	16
and	16
Don	16
Quixote	16
remained	16
behind,	16
seated	16
on	16
his	16
horse,	16
resting	16
in	16
his	16
stirrups	16
and	16
leaning	16
on	16
the	16
end	16
of	16
his	16
lance,	16
filled	16
with	16
sad	16
and	16
troubled	16
forebodings;	16
and	16
there	16
we	16
will	16
leave	16
him,	16
and	16
accompany	16
Sancho,	16
who	16
went	16
off	16
no	16
less	16
serious	16
and	16
troubled	16
than	16
he	16
left	16
his	16
master;	16
so	16
much	16
so,	16
that	16
as	16
soon	16
as	16
he	16
had	16
got	16
out	16
of	16
the	16
thicket,	16
and	16
looking	16
round	16
saw	16
that	16
Don	16
Quixote	16
was	16
not	16
within	16
sight,	16
he	16
dismounted	16
from	16
his	16
ass,	16
and	16
seating	16
himself	16
at	16
the	16
foot	16
of	16
a	16
tree	16
began	16
to	16
commune	16
with	16
himself,	16
saying,	16
“Now,	16
brother	16
Sancho,	16
let	16
us	16
know	16
where	16
your	16
worship	16
is	16
going.	16
Are	16
you	16
going	16
to	16
look	16
for	16
some	16
ass	16
that	16
has	16
been	16
lost?	16
Not	16
at	16
all.	16
Then	16
what	16
are	16
you	16
going	16
to	16
look	16
for?	16
I	16
am	16
going	16
to	16
look	16
for	16
a	16
princess,	16
that’s	16
all;	16
and	16
in	16
her	16
for	16
the	16
sun	16
of	16
beauty	16
and	16
the	16
whole	16
heaven	16
at	16
once.	16
And	16
where	16
do	16
you	16
expect	16
to	16
find	16
all	16
this,	16
Sancho?	16
Where?	16
Why,	16
in	16
the	16
great	16
city	16
of	16
El	16
Toboso.	16
Well,	16
and	16
for	16
whom	16
are	16
you	16
going	16
to	16
look	16
for	16
her?	16
For	16
the	16
famous	16
knight	16
Don	16
Quixote	16
of	16
La	16
Mancha,	16
who	16
rights	16
wrongs,	16
gives	16
food	16
to	16
those	16
who	16
thirst	16
and	16
drink	16
to	16
the	16
hungry.	16
That’s	16
all	16
very	16
well,	16
but	16
do	16
you	16
know	16
her	16
house,	16
Sancho?	16
My	16
master	16
says	16
it	16
will	16
be	16
some	16
royal	16
palace	16
or	16
grand	16
castle.	16
And	16
have	16
you	16
ever	16
seen	16
her	16
by	16
any	16
chance?	16
Neither	16
I	16
nor	16
my	16
master	16
ever	16
saw	16
her.	16
And	16
does	16
it	16
strike	16
you	16
that	16
it	16
would	16
be	16
just	16
and	16
right	16
if	16
the	16
El	16
Toboso	16
people,	16
finding	16
out	16
that	16
you	16
were	16
here	16
with	16
the	16
intention	16
of	16
going	16
to	16
tamper	16
with	16
their	16
princesses	16
and	16
trouble	16
their	16
ladies,	16
were	16
to	16
come	16
and	16
cudgel	16
your	16
ribs,	16
and	16
not	16
leave	16
a	16
whole	16
bone	16
in	16
you?	16
They	16
would,	16
indeed,	16
have	16
very	16
good	16
reason,	16
if	16
they	16
did	16
not	16
see	16
that	16
I	16
am	16
under	16
orders,	16
and	16
that	16
‘you	16
are	16
a	16
messenger,	16
my	16
friend,	16
no	16
blame	16
belongs	16
to	16
you.’	16
Don’t	16
you	16
trust	16
to	16
that,	16
Sancho,	16
for	16
the	16
Manchegan	16
folk	16
are	16
as	16
hot-tempered	16
as	16
they	16
are	16
honest,	16
and	16
won’t	16
put	16
up	16
with	16
liberties	16
from	16
anybody.	16
By	16
the	16
Lord,	16
if	16
they	16
get	16
scent	16
of	16
you,	16
it	16
will	16
be	16
worse	16
for	16
you,	16
I	16
promise	16
you.	16
Be	16
off,	16
you	16
scoundrel!	16
Let	16
the	16
bolt	16
fall.	16
Why	16
should	16
I	16
go	16
looking	16
for	16
three	16
feet	16
on	16
a	16
cat,	16
to	16
please	16
another	16
man;	16
and	16
what	16
is	16
more,	16
when	16
looking	16
for	16
Dulcinea	16
will	16
be	16
looking	16
for	16
Marica	16
in	16
Ravena,	16
or	16
the	16
bachelor	16
in	16
Salamanca?	16
The	16
devil,	16
the	16
devil	16
and	16
nobody	16
else,	16
has	16
mixed	16
me	16
up	16
in	16
this	16
business!”	16
Such	16
was	16
the	16
soliloquy	16
Sancho	16
held	16
with	16
himself,	16
and	16
all	16
the	16
conclusion	16
he	16
could	16
come	16
to	16
was	16
to	16
say	16
to	16
himself	16
again,	16
“Well,	16
there’s	16
remedy	16
for	16
everything	16
except	16
death,	16
under	16
whose	16
yoke	16
we	16
have	16
all	16
to	16
pass,	16
whether	16
we	16
like	16
it	16
or	16
not,	16
when	16
life’s	16
finished.	16
I	16
have	16
seen	16
by	16
a	16
thousand	16
signs	16
that	16
this	16
master	16
of	16
mine	16
is	16
a	16
madman	16
fit	16
to	16
be	16
tied,	16
and	16
for	16
that	16
matter,	16
I	16
too,	16
am	16
not	16
behind	16
him;	16
for	16
I’m	16
a	16
greater	16
fool	16
than	16
he	16
is	16
when	16
I	16
follow	16
him	16
and	16
serve	16
him,	16
if	16
there’s	16
any	16
truth	16
in	16
the	16
proverb	16
that	16
says,	16
‘Tell	16
me	16
what	16
company	16
thou	16
keepest,	16
and	16
I’ll	16
tell	16
thee	16
what	16
thou	16
art,’	16
or	16
in	16
that	16
other,	16
‘Not	16
with	16
whom	16
thou	16
art	16
bred,	16
but	16
with	16
whom	16
thou	16
art	16
fed.’	16
Well	16
then,	16
if	16
he	16
be	16
mad,	16
as	16
he	16
is,	16
and	16
with	16
a	16
madness	16
that	16
mostly	16
takes	16
one	16
thing	16
for	16
another,	16
and	16
white	16
for	16
black,	16
and	16
black	16
for	16
white,	16
as	16
was	16
seen	16
when	16
he	16
said	16
the	16
windmills	16
were	16
giants,	16
and	16
the	16
monks’	16
mules	16
dromedaries,	16
flocks	16
of	16
sheep	16
armies	16
of	16
enemies,	16
and	16
much	16
more	16
to	16
the	16
same	16
tune,	16
it	16
will	16
not	16
be	16
very	16
hard	16
to	16
make	16
him	16
believe	16
that	16
some	16
country	16
girl,	16
the	16
first	16
I	16
come	16
across	16
here,	16
is	16
the	16
lady	16
Dulcinea;	16
and	16
if	16
he	16
does	16
not	16
believe	16
it,	16
I’ll	16
swear	16
it;	16
and	16
if	16
he	16
should	16
swear,	16
I’ll	16
swear	16
again;	16
and	16
if	16
he	16
persists	16
I’ll	16
persist	16
still	16
more,	16
so	16
as,	16
come	16
what	16
may,	16
to	16
have	16
my	16
quoit	16
always	16
over	16
the	16
peg.	16
Maybe,	16
by	16
holding	16
out	16
in	16
this	16
way,	16
I	16
may	16
put	16
a	16
stop	16
to	16
his	16
sending	16
me	16
on	16
messages	16
of	16
this	16
kind	16
another	16
time;	16
or	16
maybe	16
he	16
will	16
think,	16
as	16
I	16
suspect	16
he	16
will,	16
that	16
one	16
of	16
those	16
wicked	16
enchanters,	16
who	16
he	16
says	16
have	16
a	16
spite	16
against	16
him,	16
has	16
changed	16
her	16
form	16
for	16
the	16
sake	16
of	16
doing	16
him	16
an	16
ill	16
turn	16
and	16
injuring	16
him.”	16
With	16
this	16
reflection	16
Sancho	16
made	16
his	16
mind	16
easy,	16
counting	16
the	16
business	16
as	16
good	16
as	16
settled,	16
and	16
stayed	16
there	16
till	16
the	16
afternoon	16
so	16
as	16
to	16
make	16
Don	16
Quixote	16
think	16
he	16
had	16
time	16
enough	16
to	16
go	16
to	16
El	16
Toboso	16
and	16
return;	16
and	16
things	16
turned	16
out	16
so	16
luckily	16
for	16
him	16
that	16
as	16
he	16
got	16
up	16
to	16
mount	16
Dapple,	16
he	16
spied,	16
coming	16
from	16
El	16
Toboso	16
towards	16
the	16
spot	16
where	16
he	16
stood,	16
three	16
peasant	16
girls	16
on	16
three	16
colts,	16
or	16
fillies—for	16
the	16
author	16
does	16
not	16
make	16
the	16
point	16
clear,	16
though	16
it	16
is	16
more	16
likely	16
they	16
were	16
she-asses,	16
the	16
usual	16
mount	16
with	16
village	16
girls;	16
but	16
as	16
it	16
is	16
of	16
no	16
great	16
consequence,	16
we	16
need	16
not	16
stop	16
to	16
prove	16
it.	16
To	16
be	16
brief,	16
the	16
instant	16
Sancho	16
saw	16
the	16
peasant	16
girls,	16
he	16
returned	16
full	16
speed	16
to	16
seek	16
his	16
master,	16
and	16
found	16
him	16
sighing	16
and	16
uttering	16
a	16
thousand	16
passionate	16
lamentations.	16
When	16
Don	16
Quixote	16
saw	16
him	16
he	16
exclaimed,	16
“What	16
news,	16
Sancho,	16
my	16
friend?	16
Am	16
I	16
to	16
mark	16
this	16
day	16
with	16
a	16
white	16
stone	16
or	16
a	16
black?”	16
“Your	16
worship,”	16
replied	16
Sancho,	16
“had	16
better	16
mark	16
it	16
with	16
ruddle,	16
like	16
the	16
inscriptions	16
on	16
the	16
walls	16
of	16
class	16
rooms,	16
that	16
those	16
who	16
see	16
it	16
may	16
see	16
it	16
plain.”	16
“Then	16
thou	16
bringest	16
good	16
news,”	16
said	16
Don	16
Quixote.	16
“So	16
good,”	16
replied	16
Sancho,	16
“that	16
your	16
worship	16
has	16
only	16
to	16
spur	16
Rocinante	16
and	16
get	16
out	16
into	16
the	16
open	16
field	16
to	16
see	16
the	16
lady	16
Dulcinea	16
del	16
Toboso,	16
who,	16
with	16
two	16
others,	16
damsels	16
of	16
hers,	16
is	16
coming	16
to	16
see	16
your	16
worship.”	16
“Holy	16
God!	16
what	16
art	16
thou	16
saying,	16
Sancho,	16
my	16
friend?”	16
exclaimed	16
Don	16
Quixote.	16
“Take	16
care	16
thou	16
art	16
not	16
deceiving	16
me,	16
or	16
seeking	16
by	16
false	16
joy	16
to	16
cheer	16
my	16
real	16
sadness.”	16
“What	16
could	16
I	16
get	16
by	16
deceiving	16
your	16
worship,”	16
returned	16
Sancho,	16
“especially	16
when	16
it	16
will	16
so	16
soon	16
be	16
shown	16
whether	16
I	16
tell	16
the	16
truth	16
or	16
not?	16
Come,	16
señor,	16
push	16
on,	16
and	16
you	16
will	16
see	16
the	16
princess	16
our	16
mistress	16
coming,	16
robed	16
and	16
adorned—in	16
fact,	16
like	16
what	16
she	16
is.	16
Her	16
damsels	16
and	16
she	16
are	16
all	16
one	16
glow	16
of	16
gold,	16
all	16
bunches	16
of	16
pearls,	16
all	16
diamonds,	16
all	16
rubies,	16
all	16
cloth	16
of	16
brocade	16
of	16
more	16
than	16
ten	16
borders;	16
with	16
their	16
hair	16
loose	16
on	16
their	16
shoulders	16
like	16
so	16
many	16
sunbeams	16
playing	16
with	16
the	16
wind;	16
and	16
moreover,	16
they	16
come	16
mounted	16
on	16
three	16
piebald	16
cackneys,	16
the	16
finest	16
sight	16
ever	16
you	16
saw.”	16
“Hackneys,	16
you	16
mean,	16
Sancho,”	16
said	16
Don	16
Quixote.	16
“There	16
is	16
not	16
much	16
difference	16
between	16
cackneys	16
and	16
hackneys,”	16
said	16
Sancho;	16
“but	16
no	16
matter	16
what	16
they	16
come	16
on,	16
there	16
they	16
are,	16
the	16
finest	16
ladies	16
one	16
could	16
wish	16
for,	16
especially	16
my	16
lady	16
the	16
princess	16
Dulcinea,	16
who	16
staggers	16
one’s	16
senses.”	16
“Let	16
us	16
go,	16
Sancho,	16
my	16
son,”	16
said	16
Don	16
Quixote,	16
“and	16
in	16
guerdon	16
of	16
this	16
news,	16
as	16
unexpected	16
as	16
it	16
is	16
good,	16
I	16
bestow	16
upon	16
thee	16
the	16
best	16
spoil	16
I	16
shall	16
win	16
in	16
the	16
first	16
adventure	16
I	16
may	16
have;	16
or	16
if	16
that	16
does	16
not	16
satisfy	16
thee,	16
I	16
promise	16
thee	16
the	16
foals	16
I	16
shall	16
have	16
this	16
year	16
from	16
my	16
three	16
mares	16
that	16
thou	16
knowest	16
are	16
in	16
foal	16
on	16
our	16
village	16
common.”	16
“I’ll	16
take	16
the	16
foals,”	16
said	16
Sancho;	16
“for	16
it	16
is	16
not	16
quite	16
certain	16
that	16
the	16
spoils	16
of	16
the	16
first	16
adventure	16
will	16
be	16
good	16
ones.”	16
By	16
this	16
time	16
they	16
had	16
cleared	16
the	16
wood,	16
and	16
saw	16
the	16
three	16
village	16
lasses	16
close	16
at	16
hand.	16
Don	16
Quixote	16
looked	16
all	16
along	16
the	16
road	16
to	16
El	16
Toboso,	16
and	16
as	16
he	16
could	16
see	16
nobody	16
except	16
the	16
three	16
peasant	16
girls,	16
he	16
was	16
completely	16
puzzled,	16
and	16
asked	16
Sancho	16
if	16
it	16
was	16
outside	16
the	16
city	16
he	16
had	16
left	16
them.	16
“How	16
outside	16
the	16
city?”	16
returned	16
Sancho.	16
“Are	16
your	16
worship’s	16
eyes	16
in	16
the	16
back	16
of	16
your	16
head,	16
that	16
you	16
can’t	16
see	16
that	16
they	16
are	16
these	16
who	16
are	16
coming	16
here,	16
shining	16
like	16
the	16
very	16
sun	16
at	16
noonday?”	16
“I	16
see	16
nothing,	16
Sancho,”	16
said	16
Don	16
Quixote,	16
“but	16
three	16
country	16
girls	16
on	16
three	16
jackasses.”	16
“Now,	16
may	16
God	16
deliver	16
me	16
from	16
the	16
devil!”	16
said	16
Sancho,	16
“and	16
can	16
it	16
be	16
that	16
your	16
worship	16
takes	16
three	16
hackneys—or	16
whatever	16
they’re	16
called—as	16
white	16
as	16
the	16
driven	16
snow,	16
for	16
jackasses?	16
By	16
the	16
Lord,	16
I	16
could	16
tear	16
my	16
beard	16
if	16
that	16
was	16
the	16
case!”	16
“Well,	16
I	16
can	16
only	16
say,	16
Sancho,	16
my	16
friend,”	16
said	16
Don	16
Quixote,	16
“that	16
it	16
is	16
as	16
plain	16
they	16
are	16
jackasses—or	16
jennyasses—as	16
that	16
I	16
am	16
Don	16
Quixote,	16
and	16
thou	16
Sancho	16
Panza:	16
at	16
any	16
rate,	16
they	16
seem	16
to	16
me	16
to	16
be	16
so.”	16
“Hush,	16
señor,”	16
said	16
Sancho,	16
“don’t	16
talk	16
that	16
way,	16
but	16
open	16
your	16
eyes,	16
and	16
come	16
and	16
pay	16
your	16
respects	16
to	16
the	16
lady	16
of	16
your	16
thoughts,	16
who	16
is	16
close	16
upon	16
us	16
now;”	16
and	16
with	16
these	16
words	16
he	16
advanced	16
to	16
receive	16
the	16
three	16
village	16
lasses,	16
and	16
dismounting	16
from	16
Dapple,	16
caught	16
hold	16
of	16
one	16
of	16
the	16
asses	16
of	16
the	16
three	16
country	16
girls	16
by	16
the	16
halter,	16
and	16
dropping	16
on	16
both	16
knees	16
on	16
the	16
ground,	16
he	16
said,	16
“Queen	16
and	16
princess	16
and	16
duchess	16
of	16
beauty,	16
may	16
it	16
please	16
your	16
haughtiness	16
and	16
greatness	16
to	16
receive	16
into	16
your	16
favour	16
and	16
good-will	16
your	16
captive	16
knight	16
who	16
stands	16
there	16
turned	16
into	16
marble	16
stone,	16
and	16
quite	16
stupefied	16
and	16
benumbed	16
at	16
finding	16
himself	16
in	16
your	16
magnificent	16
presence.	16
I	16
am	16
Sancho	16
Panza,	16
his	16
squire,	16
and	16
he	16
the	16
vagabond	16
knight	16
Don	16
Quixote	16
of	16
La	16
Mancha,	16
otherwise	16
called	16
‘The	16
Knight	16
of	16
the	16
Rueful	16
Countenance.’”	16
Don	16
Quixote	16
had	16
by	16
this	16
time	16
placed	16
himself	16
on	16
his	16
knees	16
beside	16
Sancho,	16
and,	16
with	16
eyes	16
starting	16
out	16
of	16
his	16
head	16
and	16
a	16
puzzled	16
gaze,	16
was	16
regarding	16
her	16
whom	16
Sancho	16
called	16
queen	16
and	16
lady;	16
and	16
as	16
he	16
could	16
see	16
nothing	16
in	16
her	16
except	16
a	16
village	16
lass,	16
and	16
not	16
a	16
very	16
well-favoured	16
one,	16
for	16
she	16
was	16
platter-faced	16
and	16
snub-nosed,	16
he	16
was	16
perplexed	16
and	16
bewildered,	16
and	16
did	16
not	16
venture	16
to	16
open	16
his	16
lips.	16
The	16
country	16
girls,	16
at	16
the	16
same	16
time,	16
were	16
astonished	16
to	16
see	16
these	16
two	16
men,	16
so	16
different	16
in	16
appearance,	16
on	16
their	16
knees,	16
preventing	16
their	16
companion	16
from	16
going	16
on.	16
She,	16
however,	16
who	16
had	16
been	16
stopped,	16
breaking	16
silence,	16
said	16
angrily	16
and	16
testily,	16
“Get	16
out	16
of	16
the	16
way,	16
bad	16
luck	16
to	16
you,	16
and	16
let	16
us	16
pass,	16
for	16
we	16
are	16
in	16
a	16
hurry.”	16

Size	16
To	16
which	16
Sancho	16
returned,	16
“Oh,	16
princess	16
and	16
universal	16
lady	16
of	16
El	16
Toboso,	16
is	16
not	16
your	16
magnanimous	16
heart	16
softened	16
by	16
seeing	16
the	16
pillar	16
and	16
prop	16
of	16
knight-errantry	16
on	16
his	16
knees	16
before	16
your	16
sublimated	16
presence?”	16
On	16
hearing	16
this,	16
one	16
of	16
the	16
others	16
exclaimed,	16
“Woa	16
then!	16
why,	16
I’m	16
rubbing	16
thee	16
down,	16
she-ass	16
of	16
my	16
father-in-law!	16
See	16
how	16
the	16
lordlings	16
come	16
to	16
make	16
game	16
of	16
the	16
village	16
girls	16
now,	16
as	16
if	16
we	16
here	16
could	16
not	16
chaff	16
as	16
well	16
as	16
themselves.	16
Go	16
your	16
own	16
way,	16
and	16
let	16
us	16
go	16
ours,	16
and	16
it	16
will	16
be	16
better	16
for	16
you.”	16
“Get	16
up,	16
Sancho,”	16
said	16
Don	16
Quixote	16
at	16
this;	16
“I	16
see	16
that	16
fortune,	16
‘with	16
evil	16
done	16
to	16
me	16
unsated	16
still,’	16
has	16
taken	16
possession	16
of	16
all	16
the	16
roads	16
by	16
which	16
any	16
comfort	16
may	16
reach	16
‘this	16
wretched	16
soul’	16
that	16
I	16
carry	16
in	16
my	16
flesh.	16
And	16
thou,	16
highest	16
perfection	16
of	16
excellence	16
that	16
can	16
be	16
desired,	16
utmost	16
limit	16
of	16
grace	16
in	16
human	16
shape,	16
sole	16
relief	16
of	16
this	16
afflicted	16
heart	16
that	16
adores	16
thee,	16
though	16
the	16
malign	16
enchanter	16
that	16
persecutes	16
me	16
has	16
brought	16
clouds	16
and	16
cataracts	16
on	16
my	16
eyes,	16
and	16
to	16
them,	16
and	16
them	16
only,	16
transformed	16
thy	16
unparagoned	16
beauty	16
and	16
changed	16
thy	16
features	16
into	16
those	16
of	16
a	16
poor	16
peasant	16
girl,	16
if	16
so	16
be	16
he	16
has	16
not	16
at	16
the	16
same	16
time	16
changed	16
mine	16
into	16
those	16
of	16
some	16
monster	16
to	16
render	16
them	16
loathsome	16
in	16
thy	16
sight,	16
refuse	16
not	16
to	16
look	16
upon	16
me	16
with	16
tenderness	16
and	16
love;	16
seeing	16
in	16
this	16
submission	16
that	16
I	16
make	16
on	16
my	16
knees	16
to	16
thy	16
transformed	16
beauty	16
the	16
humility	16
with	16
which	16
my	16
soul	16
adores	16
thee.”	16
“Hey-day!	16
My	16
grandfather!”	16
cried	16
the	16
girl,	16
“much	16
I	16
care	16
for	16
your	16
love-making!	16
Get	16
out	16
of	16
the	16
way	16
and	16
let	16
us	16
pass,	16
and	16
we’ll	16
thank	16
you.”	16
Sancho	16
stood	16
aside	16
and	16
let	16
her	16
go,	16
very	16
well	16
pleased	16
to	16
have	16
got	16
so	16
well	16
out	16
of	16
the	16
hobble	16
he	16
was	16
in.	16
The	16
instant	16
the	16
village	16
lass	16
who	16
had	16
done	16
duty	16
for	16
Dulcinea	16
found	16
herself	16
free,	16
prodding	16
her	16
“cackney”	16
with	16
a	16
spike	16
she	16
had	16
at	16
the	16
end	16
of	16
a	16
stick,	16
she	16
set	16
off	16
at	16
full	16
speed	16
across	16
the	16
field.	16
The	16
she-ass,	16
however,	16
feeling	16
the	16
point	16
more	16
acutely	16
than	16
usual,	16
began	16
cutting	16
such	16
capers,	16
that	16
it	16
flung	16
the	16
lady	16
Dulcinea	16
to	16
the	16
ground;	16
seeing	16
which,	16
Don	16
Quixote	16
ran	16
to	16
raise	16
her	16
up,	16
and	16
Sancho	16
to	16
fix	16
and	16
girth	16
the	16
pack-saddle,	16
which	16
also	16
had	16
slipped	16
under	16
the	16
ass’s	16
belly.	16
The	16
pack-saddle	16
being	16
secured,	16
as	16
Don	16
Quixote	16
was	16
about	16
to	16
lift	16
up	16
his	16
enchanted	16
mistress	16
in	16
his	16
arms	16
and	16
put	16
her	16
upon	16
her	16
beast,	16
the	16
lady,	16
getting	16
up	16
from	16
the	16
ground,	16
saved	16
him	16
the	16
trouble,	16
for,	16
going	16
back	16
a	16
little,	16
she	16
took	16
a	16
short	16
run,	16
and	16
putting	16
both	16
hands	16
on	16
the	16
croup	16
of	16
the	16
ass	16
she	16
dropped	16
into	16
the	16
saddle	16
more	16
lightly	16
than	16
a	16
falcon,	16
and	16
sat	16
astride	16
like	16
a	16
man,	16
whereat	16
Sancho	16
said,	16
“Rogue!	16
but	16
our	16
lady	16
is	16
lighter	16
than	16
a	16
lanner,	16
and	16
might	16
teach	16
the	16
cleverest	16
Cordovan	16
or	16
Mexican	16
how	16
to	16
mount;	16
she	16
cleared	16
the	16
back	16
of	16
the	16
saddle	16
in	16
one	16
jump,	16
and	16
without	16
spurs	16
she	16
is	16
making	16
the	16
hackney	16
go	16
like	16
a	16
zebra;	16
and	16
her	16
damsels	16
are	16
no	16
way	16
behind	16
her,	16
for	16
they	16
all	16
fly	16
like	16
the	16
wind;”	16
which	16
was	16
the	16
truth,	16
for	16
as	16
soon	16
as	16
they	16
saw	16
Dulcinea	16
mounted,	16
they	16
pushed	16
on	16
after	16
her,	16
and	16
sped	16
away	16
without	16
looking	16
back,	16
for	16
more	16
than	16
half	16
a	16
league.	16
Don	16
Quixote	16
followed	16
them	16
with	16
his	16
eyes,	16
and	16
when	16
they	16
were	16
no	16
longer	16
in	16
sight,	16
he	16
turned	16
to	16
Sancho	16
and	16
said,	16
“How	16
now,	16
Sancho?	16
thou	16
seest	16
how	16
I	16
am	16
hated	16
by	16
enchanters!	16
And	16
see	16
to	16
what	16
a	16
length	16
the	16
malice	16
and	16
spite	16
they	16
bear	16
me	16
go,	16
when	16
they	16
seek	16
to	16
deprive	16
me	16
of	16
the	16
happiness	16
it	16
would	16
give	16
me	16
to	16
see	16
my	16
lady	16
in	16
her	16
own	16
proper	16
form.	16
The	16
fact	16
is	16
I	16
was	16
born	16
to	16
be	16
an	16
example	16
of	16
misfortune,	16
and	16
the	16
target	16
and	16
mark	16
at	16
which	16
the	16
arrows	16
of	16
adversity	16
are	16
aimed	16
and	16
directed.	16
Observe	16
too,	16
Sancho,	16
that	16
these	16
traitors	16
were	16
not	16
content	16
with	16
changing	16
and	16
transforming	16
my	16
Dulcinea,	16
but	16
they	16
transformed	16
and	16
changed	16
her	16
into	16
a	16
shape	16
as	16
mean	16
and	16
ill-favoured	16
as	16
that	16
of	16
the	16
village	16
girl	16
yonder;	16
and	16
at	16
the	16
same	16
time	16
they	16
robbed	16
her	16
of	16
that	16
which	16
is	16
such	16
a	16
peculiar	16
property	16
of	16
ladies	16
of	16
distinction,	16
that	16
is	16
to	16
say,	16
the	16
sweet	16
fragrance	16
that	16
comes	16
of	16
being	16
always	16
among	16
perfumes	16
and	16
flowers.	16
For	16
I	16
must	16
tell	16
thee,	16
Sancho,	16
that	16
when	16
I	16
approached	16
to	16
put	16
Dulcinea	16
upon	16
her	16
hackney	16
(as	16
thou	16
sayest	16
it	16
was,	16
though	16
to	16
me	16
it	16
appeared	16
a	16
she-ass),	16
she	16
gave	16
me	16
a	16
whiff	16
of	16
raw	16
garlic	16
that	16
made	16
my	16
head	16
reel,	16
and	16
poisoned	16
my	16
very	16
heart.”	16
“O	16
scum	16
of	16
the	16
earth!”	16
cried	16
Sancho	16
at	16
this,	16
“O	16
miserable,	16
spiteful	16
enchanters!	16
O	16
that	16
I	16
could	16
see	16
you	16
all	16
strung	16
by	16
the	16
gills,	16
like	16
sardines	16
on	16
a	16
twig!	16
Ye	16
know	16
a	16
great	16
deal,	16
ye	16
can	16
do	16
a	16
great	16
deal,	16
and	16
ye	16
do	16
a	16
great	16
deal	16
more.	16
It	16
ought	16
to	16
have	16
been	16
enough	16
for	16
you,	16
ye	16
scoundrels,	16
to	16
have	16
changed	16
the	16
pearls	16
of	16
my	16
lady’s	16
eyes	16
into	16
oak	16
galls,	16
and	16
her	16
hair	16
of	16
purest	16
gold	16
into	16
the	16
bristles	16
of	16
a	16
red	16
ox’s	16
tail,	16
and	16
in	16
short,	16
all	16
her	16
features	16
from	16
fair	16
to	16
foul,	16
without	16
meddling	16
with	16
her	16
smell;	16
for	16
by	16
that	16
we	16
might	16
somehow	16
have	16
found	16
out	16
what	16
was	16
hidden	16
underneath	16
that	16
ugly	16
rind;	16
though,	16
to	16
tell	16
the	16
truth,	16
I	16
never	16
perceived	16
her	16
ugliness,	16
but	16
only	16
her	16
beauty,	16
which	16
was	16
raised	16
to	16
the	16
highest	16
pitch	16
of	16
perfection	16
by	16
a	16
mole	16
she	16
had	16
on	16
her	16
right	16
lip,	16
like	16
a	16
moustache,	16
with	16
seven	16
or	16
eight	16
red	16
hairs	16
like	16
threads	16
of	16
gold,	16
and	16
more	16
than	16
a	16
palm	16
long.”	16
“From	16
the	16
correspondence	16
which	16
exists	16
between	16
those	16
of	16
the	16
face	16
and	16
those	16
of	16
the	16
body,”	16
said	16
Don	16
Quixote,	16
“Dulcinea	16
must	16
have	16
another	16
mole	16
resembling	16
that	16
on	16
the	16
thick	16
of	16
the	16
thigh	16
on	16
that	16
side	16
on	16
which	16
she	16
has	16
the	16
one	16
on	16
her	16
face;	16
but	16
hairs	16
of	16
the	16
length	16
thou	16
hast	16
mentioned	16
are	16
very	16
long	16
for	16
moles.”	16
“Well,	16
all	16
I	16
can	16
say	16
is	16
there	16
they	16
were	16
as	16
plain	16
as	16
could	16
be,”	16
replied	16
Sancho.	16
“I	16
believe	16
it,	16
my	16
friend,”	16
returned	16
Don	16
Quixote;	16
“for	16
nature	16
bestowed	16
nothing	16
on	16
Dulcinea	16
that	16
was	16
not	16
perfect	16
and	16
well-finished;	16
and	16
so,	16
if	16
she	16
had	16
a	16
hundred	16
moles	16
like	16
the	16
one	16
thou	16
hast	16
described,	16
in	16
her	16
they	16
would	16
not	16
be	16
moles,	16
but	16
moons	16
and	16
shining	16
stars.	16
But	16
tell	16
me,	16
Sancho,	16
that	16
which	16
seemed	16
to	16
me	16
to	16
be	16
a	16
pack-saddle	16
as	16
thou	16
wert	16
fixing	16
it,	16
was	16
it	16
a	16
flat-saddle	16
or	16
a	16
side-saddle?”	16
“It	16
was	16
neither,”	16
replied	16
Sancho,	16
“but	16
a	16
jineta	16
saddle,	16
with	16
a	16
field	16
covering	16
worth	16
half	16
a	16
kingdom,	16
so	16
rich	16
is	16
it.”	16
“And	16
that	16
I	16
could	16
not	16
see	16
all	16
this,	16
Sancho!”	16
said	16
Don	16
Quixote;	16
“once	16
more	16
I	16
say,	16
and	16
will	16
say	16
a	16
thousand	16
times,	16
I	16
am	16
the	16
most	16
unfortunate	16
of	16
men.”	16
Sancho,	16
the	16
rogue,	16
had	16
enough	16
to	16
do	16
to	16
hide	16
his	16
laughter,	16
at	16
hearing	16
the	16
simplicity	16
of	16
the	16
master	16
he	16
had	16
so	16
nicely	16
befooled.	16
At	16
length,	16
after	16
a	16
good	16
deal	16
more	16
conversation	16
had	16
passed	16
between	16
them,	16
they	16
remounted	16
their	16
beasts,	16
and	16
followed	16
the	16
road	16
to	16
Saragossa,	16
which	16
they	16
expected	16
to	16
reach	16
in	16
time	16
to	16
take	16
part	16
in	16
a	16
certain	16
grand	16
festival	16
which	16
is	16
held	16
every	16
year	16
in	16
that	16
illustrious	16
city;	16
but	16
before	16
they	16
got	16
there	16
things	16
happened	16
to	16
them,	16
so	16
many,	16
so	16
important,	16
and	16
so	16
strange,	16
that	16
they	16
deserve	16
to	16
be	16
recorded	16
and	16
read,	16
as	16
will	16
be	16
seen	16
farther	16
on.	16

Dejected	16
beyond	16
measure	16
did	16
Don	16
Quixote	16
pursue	16
his	16
journey,	16
turning	16
over	16
in	16
his	16
mind	16
the	16
cruel	16
trick	16
the	16
enchanters	16
had	16
played	16
him	16
in	16
changing	16
his	16
lady	16
Dulcinea	16
into	16
the	16
vile	16
shape	16
of	16
the	16
village	16
lass,	16
nor	16
could	16
he	16
think	16
of	16
any	16
way	16
of	16
restoring	16
her	16
to	16
her	16
original	16
form;	16
and	16
these	16
reflections	16
so	16
absorbed	16
him,	16
that	16
without	16
being	16
aware	16
of	16
it	16
he	16
let	16
go	16
Rocinante’s	16
bridle,	16
and	16
he,	16
perceiving	16
the	16
liberty	16
that	16
was	16
granted	16
him,	16
stopped	16
at	16
every	16
step	16
to	16
crop	16
the	16
fresh	16
grass	16
with	16
which	16
the	16
plain	16
abounded.	16
Sancho	16
recalled	16
him	16
from	16
his	16
reverie.	16
“Melancholy,	16
señor,”	16
said	16
he,	16
“was	16
made,	16
not	16
for	16
beasts,	16
but	16
for	16
men;	16
but	16
if	16
men	16
give	16
way	16
to	16
it	16
overmuch	16
they	16
turn	16
to	16
beasts;	16
control	16
yourself,	16
your	16
worship;	16
be	16
yourself	16
again;	16
gather	16
up	16
Rocinante’s	16
reins;	16
cheer	16
up,	16
rouse	16
yourself	16
and	16
show	16
that	16
gallant	16
spirit	16
that	16
knights-errant	16
ought	16
to	16
have.	16
What	16
the	16
devil	16
is	16
this?	16
What	16
weakness	16
is	16
this?	16
Are	16
we	16
here	16
or	16
in	16
France?	16
The	16
devil	16
fly	16
away	16
with	16
all	16
the	16
Dulcineas	16
in	16
the	16
world;	16
for	16
the	16
well-being	16
of	16
a	16
single	16
knight-errant	16
is	16
of	16
more	16
consequence	16
than	16
all	16
the	16
enchantments	16
and	16
transformations	16
on	16
earth.”	16
“Hush,	16
Sancho,”	16
said	16
Don	16
Quixote	16
in	16
a	16
weak	16
and	16
faint	16
voice,	16
“hush	16
and	16
utter	16
no	16
blasphemies	16
against	16
that	16
enchanted	16
lady;	16
for	16
I	16
alone	16
am	16
to	16
blame	16
for	16
her	16
misfortune	16
and	16
hard	16
fate;	16
her	16
calamity	16
has	16
come	16
of	16
the	16
hatred	16
the	16
wicked	16
bear	16
me.”	16
“So	16
say	16
I,”	16
returned	16
Sancho;	16
“his	16
heart	16
rend	16
in	16
twain,	16
I	16
trow,	16
who	16
saw	16
her	16
once,	16
to	16
see	16
her	16
now.”	16
“Thou	16
mayest	16
well	16
say	16
that,	16
Sancho,”	16
replied	16
Don	16
Quixote,	16
“as	16
thou	16
sawest	16
her	16
in	16
the	16
full	16
perfection	16
of	16
her	16
beauty;	16
for	16
the	16
enchantment	16
does	16
not	16
go	16
so	16
far	16
as	16
to	16
pervert	16
thy	16
vision	16
or	16
hide	16
her	16
loveliness	16
from	16
thee;	16
against	16
me	16
alone	16
and	16
against	16
my	16
eyes	16
is	16
the	16
strength	16
of	16
its	16
venom	16
directed.	16
Nevertheless,	16
there	16
is	16
one	16
thing	16
which	16
has	16
occurred	16
to	16
me,	16
and	16
that	16
is	16
that	16
thou	16
didst	16
ill	16
describe	16
her	16
beauty	16
to	16
me,	16
for,	16
as	16
well	16
as	16
I	16
recollect,	16
thou	16
saidst	16
that	16
her	16
eyes	16
were	16
pearls;	16
but	16
eyes	16
that	16
are	16
like	16
pearls	16
are	16
rather	16
the	16
eyes	16
of	16
a	16
sea-bream	16
than	16
of	16
a	16
lady,	16
and	16
I	16
am	16
persuaded	16
that	16
Dulcinea’s	16
must	16
be	16
green	16
emeralds,	16
full	16
and	16
soft,	16
with	16
two	16
rainbows	16
for	16
eyebrows;	16
take	16
away	16
those	16
pearls	16
from	16
her	16
eyes	16
and	16
transfer	16
them	16
to	16
her	16
teeth;	16
for	16
beyond	16
a	16
doubt,	16
Sancho,	16
thou	16
hast	16
taken	16
the	16
one	16
for	16
the	16
other,	16
the	16
eyes	16
for	16
the	16
teeth.”	16
“Very	16
likely,”	16
said	16
Sancho;	16
“for	16
her	16
beauty	16
bewildered	16
me	16
as	16
much	16
as	16
her	16
ugliness	16
did	16
your	16
worship;	16
but	16
let	16
us	16
leave	16
it	16
all	16
to	16
God,	16
who	16
alone	16
knows	16
what	16
is	16
to	16
happen	16
in	16
this	16
vale	16
of	16
tears,	16
in	16
this	16
evil	16
world	16
of	16
ours,	16
where	16
there	16
is	16
hardly	16
a	16
thing	16
to	16
be	16
found	16
without	16
some	16
mixture	16
of	16
wickedness,	16
roguery,	16
and	16
rascality.	16
But	16
one	16
thing,	16
señor,	16
troubles	16
me	16
more	16
than	16
all	16
the	16
rest,	16
and	16
that	16
is	16
thinking	16
what	16
is	16
to	16
be	16
done	16
when	16
your	16
worship	16
conquers	16
some	16
giant,	16
or	16
some	16
other	16
knight,	16
and	16
orders	16
him	16
to	16
go	16
and	16
present	16
himself	16
before	16
the	16
beauty	16
of	16
the	16
lady	16
Dulcinea.	16
Where	16
is	16
this	16
poor	16
giant,	16
or	16
this	16
poor	16
wretch	16
of	16
a	16
vanquished	16
knight,	16
to	16
find	16
her?	16
I	16
think	16
I	16
can	16
see	16
them	16
wandering	16
all	16
over	16
El	16
Toboso,	16
looking	16
like	16
noddies,	16
and	16
asking	16
for	16
my	16
lady	16
Dulcinea;	16
and	16
even	16
if	16
they	16
meet	16
her	16
in	16
the	16
middle	16
of	16
the	16
street	16
they	16
won’t	16
know	16
her	16
any	16
more	16
than	16
they	16
would	16
my	16
father.”	16
“Perhaps,	16
Sancho,”	16
returned	16
Don	16
Quixote,	16
“the	16
enchantment	16
does	16
not	16
go	16
so	16
far	16
as	16
to	16
deprive	16
conquered	16
and	16
presented	16
giants	16
and	16
knights	16
of	16
the	16
power	16
of	16
recognising	16
Dulcinea;	16
we	16
will	16
try	16
by	16
experiment	16
with	16
one	16
or	16
two	16
of	16
the	16
first	16
I	16
vanquish	16
and	16
send	16
to	16
her,	16
whether	16
they	16
see	16
her	16
or	16
not,	16
by	16
commanding	16
them	16
to	16
return	16
and	16
give	16
me	16
an	16
account	16
of	16
what	16
happened	16
to	16
them	16
in	16
this	16
respect.”	16
“I	16
declare,	16
I	16
think	16
what	16
your	16
worship	16
has	16
proposed	16
is	16
excellent,”	16
said	16
Sancho;	16
“and	16
that	16
by	16
this	16
plan	16
we	16
shall	16
find	16
out	16
what	16
we	16
want	16
to	16
know;	16
and	16
if	16
it	16
be	16
that	16
it	16
is	16
only	16
from	16
your	16
worship	16
she	16
is	16
hidden,	16
the	16
misfortune	16
will	16
be	16
more	16
yours	16
than	16
hers;	16
but	16
so	16
long	16
as	16
the	16
lady	16
Dulcinea	16
is	16
well	16
and	16
happy,	16
we	16
on	16
our	16
part	16
will	16
make	16
the	16
best	16
of	16
it,	16
and	16
get	16
on	16
as	16
well	16
as	16
we	16
can,	16
seeking	16
our	16
adventures,	16
and	16
leaving	16
Time	16
to	16
take	16
his	16
own	16
course;	16
for	16
he	16
is	16
the	16
best	16
physician	16
for	16
these	16
and	16
greater	16
ailments.”	16
Don	16
Quixote	16
was	16
about	16
to	16
reply	16
to	16
Sancho	16
Panza,	16
but	16
he	16
was	16
prevented	16
by	16
a	16
cart	16
crossing	16
the	16
road	16
full	16
of	16
the	16
most	16
diverse	16
and	16
strange	16
personages	16
and	16
figures	16
that	16
could	16
be	16
imagined.	16
He	16
who	16
led	16
the	16
mules	16
and	16
acted	16
as	16
carter	16
was	16
a	16
hideous	16
demon;	16
the	16
cart	16
was	16
open	16
to	16
the	16
sky,	16
without	16
a	16
tilt	16
or	16
cane	16
roof,	16
and	16
the	16
first	16
figure	16
that	16
presented	16
itself	16
to	16
Don	16
Quixote’s	16
eyes	16
was	16
that	16
of	16
Death	16
itself	16
with	16
a	16
human	16
face;	16
next	16
to	16
it	16
was	16
an	16
angel	16
with	16
large	16
painted	16
wings,	16
and	16
at	16
one	16
side	16
an	16
emperor,	16
with	16
a	16
crown,	16
to	16
all	16
appearance	16
of	16
gold,	16
on	16
his	16
head.	16
At	16
the	16
feet	16
of	16
Death	16
was	16
the	16
god	16
called	16
Cupid,	16
without	16
his	16
bandage,	16
but	16
with	16
his	16
bow,	16
quiver,	16
and	16
arrows;	16
there	16
was	16
also	16
a	16
knight	16
in	16
full	16
armour,	16
except	16
that	16
he	16
had	16
no	16
morion	16
or	16
helmet,	16
but	16
only	16
a	16
hat	16
decked	16
with	16
plumes	16
of	16
divers	16
colours;	16
and	16
along	16
with	16
these	16
there	16
were	16
others	16
with	16
a	16
variety	16
of	16
costumes	16
and	16
faces.	16
All	16
this,	16
unexpectedly	16
encountered,	16
took	16
Don	16
Quixote	16
somewhat	16
aback,	16
and	16
struck	16
terror	16
into	16
the	16
heart	16
of	16
Sancho;	16
but	16
the	16
next	16
instant	16
Don	16
Quixote	16
was	16
glad	16
of	16
it,	16
believing	16
that	16
some	16
new	16
perilous	16
adventure	16
was	16
presenting	16
itself	16
to	16
him,	16
and	16
under	16
this	16
impression,	16
and	16
with	16
a	16
spirit	16
prepared	16
to	16
face	16
any	16
danger,	16
he	16
planted	16
himself	16
in	16
front	16
of	16
the	16
cart,	16
and	16
in	16
a	16
loud	16
and	16
menacing	16
tone,	16
exclaimed,	16
“Carter,	16
or	16
coachman,	16
or	16
devil,	16
or	16
whatever	16
thou	16
art,	16
tell	16
me	16
at	16
once	16
who	16
thou	16
art,	16
whither	16
thou	16
art	16
going,	16
and	16
who	16
these	16
folk	16
are	16
thou	16
carriest	16
in	16
thy	16
wagon,	16
which	16
looks	16
more	16
like	16
Charon’s	16
boat	16
than	16
an	16
ordinary	16
cart.”	16
To	16
which	16
the	16
devil,	16
stopping	16
the	16
cart,	16
answered	16
quietly,	16
“Señor,	16
we	16
are	16
players	16
of	16
Angulo	16
el	16
Malo’s	16
company;	16
we	16
have	16
been	16
acting	16
the	16
play	16
of	16
‘The	16
Cortés	16
of	16
Death’	16
this	16
morning,	16
which	16
is	16
the	16
octave	16
of	16
Corpus	16
Christi,	16
in	16
a	16
village	16
behind	16
that	16
hill,	16
and	16
we	16
have	16
to	16
act	16
it	16
this	16
afternoon	16
in	16
that	16
village	16
which	16
you	16
can	16
see	16
from	16
this;	16
and	16
as	16
it	16
is	16
so	16
near,	16
and	16
to	16
save	16
the	16
trouble	16
of	16
undressing	16
and	16
dressing	16
again,	16
we	16
go	16
in	16
the	16
costumes	16
in	16
which	16
we	16
perform.	16
That	16
lad	16
there	16
appears	16
as	16
Death,	16
that	16
other	16
as	16
an	16
angel,	16
that	16
woman,	16
the	16
manager’s	16
wife,	16
plays	16
the	16
queen,	16
this	16
one	16
the	16
soldier,	16
that	16
the	16
emperor,	16
and	16
I	16
the	16
devil;	16
and	16
I	16
am	16
one	16
of	16
the	16
principal	16
characters	16
of	16
the	16
play,	16
for	16
in	16
this	16
company	16
I	16
take	16
the	16
leading	16
parts.	16
If	16
you	16
want	16
to	16
know	16
anything	16
more	16
about	16
us,	16
ask	16
me	16
and	16
I	16
will	16
answer	16
with	16
the	16
utmost	16
exactitude,	16
for	16
as	16
I	16
am	16
a	16
devil	16
I	16
am	16
up	16
to	16
everything.”	16
“By	16
the	16
faith	16
of	16
a	16
knight-errant,”	16
replied	16
Don	16
Quixote,	16
“when	16
I	16
saw	16
this	16
cart	16
I	16
fancied	16
some	16
great	16
adventure	16
was	16
presenting	16
itself	16
to	16
me;	16
but	16
I	16
declare	16
one	16
must	16
touch	16
with	16
the	16
hand	16
what	16
appears	16
to	16
the	16
eye,	16
if	16
illusions	16
are	16
to	16
be	16
avoided.	16
God	16
speed	16
you,	16
good	16
people;	16
keep	16
your	16
festival,	16
and	16
remember,	16
if	16
you	16
demand	16
of	16
me	16
ought	16
wherein	16
I	16
can	16
render	16
you	16
a	16
service,	16
I	16
will	16
do	16
it	16
gladly	16
and	16
willingly,	16
for	16
from	16
a	16
child	16
I	16
was	16
fond	16
of	16
the	16
play,	16
and	16
in	16
my	16
youth	16
a	16
keen	16
lover	16
of	16
the	16
actor’s	16
art.”	16
While	16
they	16
were	16
talking,	16
fate	16
so	16
willed	16
it	16
that	16
one	16
of	16
the	16
company	16
in	16
a	16
mummers’	16
dress	16
with	16
a	16
great	16
number	16
of	16
bells,	16
and	16
armed	16
with	16
three	16
blown	16
ox-bladders	16
at	16
the	16
end	16
of	16
a	16
stick,	16
joined	16
them,	16
and	16
this	16
merry-andrew	16
approaching	16
Don	16
Quixote,	16
began	16
flourishing	16
his	16
stick	16
and	16
banging	16
the	16
ground	16
with	16
the	16
bladders	16
and	16
cutting	16
capers	16
with	16
great	16
jingling	16
of	16
the	16
bells,	16
which	16
untoward	16
apparition	16
so	16
startled	16
Rocinante	16
that,	16
in	16
spite	16
of	16
Don	16
Quixote’s	16
efforts	16
to	16
hold	16
him	16
in,	16
taking	16
the	16
bit	16
between	16
his	16
teeth	16
he	16
set	16
off	16
across	16
the	16
plain	16
with	16
greater	16
speed	16
than	16
the	16
bones	16
of	16
his	16
anatomy	16
ever	16
gave	16
any	16
promise	16
of.	16

Sancho,	16
who	16
thought	16
his	16
master	16
was	16
in	16
danger	16
of	16
being	16
thrown,	16
jumped	16
off	16
Dapple,	16
and	16
ran	16
in	16
all	16
haste	16
to	16
help	16
him;	16
but	16
by	16
the	16
time	16
he	16
reached	16
him	16
he	16
was	16
already	16
on	16
the	16
ground,	16
and	16
beside	16
him	16
was	16
Rocinante,	16
who	16
had	16
come	16
down	16
with	16
his	16
master,	16
the	16
usual	16
end	16
and	16
upshot	16
of	16
Rocinante’s	16
vivacity	16
and	16
high	16
spirits.	16
But	16
the	16
moment	16
Sancho	16
quitted	16
his	16
beast	16
to	16
go	16
and	16
help	16
Don	16
Quixote,	16
the	16
dancing	16
devil	16
with	16
the	16
bladders	16
jumped	16
up	16
on	16
Dapple,	16
and	16
beating	16
him	16
with	16
them,	16
more	16
by	16
the	16
fright	16
and	16
the	16
noise	16
than	16
by	16
the	16
pain	16
of	16
the	16
blows,	16
made	16
him	16
fly	16
across	16
the	16
fields	16
towards	16
the	16
village	16
where	16
they	16
were	16
going	16
to	16
hold	16
their	16
festival.	16
Sancho	16
witnessed	16
Dapple’s	16
career	16
and	16
his	16
master’s	16
fall,	16
and	16
did	16
not	16
know	16
which	16
of	16
the	16
two	16
cases	16
of	16
need	16
he	16
should	16
attend	16
to	16
first;	16
but	16
in	16
the	16
end,	16
like	16
a	16
good	16
squire	16
and	16
good	16
servant,	16
he	16
let	16
his	16
love	16
for	16
his	16
master	16
prevail	16
over	16
his	16
affection	16
for	16
his	16
ass;	16
though	16
every	16
time	16
he	16
saw	16
the	16
bladders	16
rise	16
in	16
the	16
air	16
and	16
come	16
down	16
on	16
the	16
hind	16
quarters	16
of	16
his	16
Dapple	16
he	16
felt	16
the	16
pains	16
and	16
terrors	16
of	16
death,	16
and	16
he	16
would	16
have	16
rather	16
had	16
the	16
blows	16
fall	16
on	16
the	16
apples	16
of	16
his	16
own	16
eyes	16
than	16
on	16
the	16
least	16
hair	16
of	16
his	16
ass’s	16
tail.	16
In	16
this	16
trouble	16
and	16
perplexity	16
he	16
came	16
to	16
where	16
Don	16
Quixote	16
lay	16
in	16
a	16
far	16
sorrier	16
plight	16
than	16
he	16
liked,	16
and	16
having	16
helped	16
him	16
to	16
mount	16
Rocinante,	16
he	16
said	16
to	16
him,	16
“Señor,	16
the	16
devil	16
has	16
carried	16
off	16
my	16
Dapple.”	16
“What	16
devil?”	16
asked	16
Don	16
Quixote.	16
“The	16
one	16
with	16
the	16
bladders,”	16
said	16
Sancho.	16
“Then	16
I	16
will	16
recover	16
him,”	16
said	16
Don	16
Quixote,	16
“even	16
if	16
he	16
be	16
shut	16
up	16
with	16
him	16
in	16
the	16
deepest	16
and	16
darkest	16
dungeons	16
of	16
hell.	16
Follow	16
me,	16
Sancho,	16
for	16
the	16
cart	16
goes	16
slowly,	16
and	16
with	16
the	16
mules	16
of	16
it	16
I	16
will	16
make	16
good	16
the	16
loss	16
of	16
Dapple.”	16
“You	16
need	16
not	16
take	16
the	16
trouble,	16
señor,”	16
said	16
Sancho;	16
“keep	16
cool,	16
for	16
as	16
I	16
now	16
see,	16
the	16
devil	16
has	16
let	16
Dapple	16
go	16
and	16
he	16
is	16
coming	16
back	16
to	16
his	16
old	16
quarters;”	16
and	16
so	16
it	16
turned	16
out,	16
for,	16
having	16
come	16
down	16
with	16
Dapple,	16
in	16
imitation	16
of	16
Don	16
Quixote	16
and	16
Rocinante,	16
the	16
devil	16
made	16
off	16
on	16
foot	16
to	16
the	16
town,	16
and	16
the	16
ass	16
came	16
back	16
to	16
his	16
master.	16
“For	16
all	16
that,”	16
said	16
Don	16
Quixote,	16
“it	16
will	16
be	16
well	16
to	16
visit	16
the	16
discourtesy	16
of	16
that	16
devil	16
upon	16
some	16
of	16
those	16
in	16
the	16
cart,	16
even	16
if	16
it	16
were	16
the	16
emperor	16
himself.”	16
“Don’t	16
think	16
of	16
it,	16
your	16
worship,”	16
returned	16
Sancho;	16
“take	16
my	16
advice	16
and	16
never	16
meddle	16
with	16
actors,	16
for	16
they	16
are	16
a	16
favoured	16
class;	16
I	16
myself	16
have	16
known	16
an	16
actor	16
taken	16
up	16
for	16
two	16
murders,	16
and	16
yet	16
come	16
off	16
scot-free;	16
remember	16
that,	16
as	16
they	16
are	16
merry	16
folk	16
who	16
give	16
pleasure,	16
everyone	16
favours	16
and	16
protects	16
them,	16
and	16
helps	16
and	16
makes	16
much	16
of	16
them,	16
above	16
all	16
when	16
they	16
are	16
those	16
of	16
the	16
royal	16
companies	16
and	16
under	16
patent,	16
all	16
or	16
most	16
of	16
whom	16
in	16
dress	16
and	16
appearance	16
look	16
like	16
princes.”	16
“Still,	16
for	16
all	16
that,”	16
said	16
Don	16
Quixote,	16
“the	16
player	16
devil	16
must	16
not	16
go	16
off	16
boasting,	16
even	16
if	16
the	16
whole	16
human	16
race	16
favours	16
him.”	16
So	16
saying,	16
he	16
made	16
for	16
the	16
cart,	16
which	16
was	16
now	16
very	16
near	16
the	16
town,	16
shouting	16
out	16
as	16
he	16
went,	16
“Stay!	16
halt!	16
ye	16
merry,	16
jovial	16
crew!	16
I	16
want	16
to	16
teach	16
you	16
how	16
to	16
treat	16
asses	16
and	16
animals	16
that	16
serve	16
the	16
squires	16
of	16
knights-errant	16
for	16
steeds.”	16
So	16
loud	16
were	16
the	16
shouts	16
of	16
Don	16
Quixote,	16
that	16
those	16
in	16
the	16
cart	16
heard	16
and	16
understood	16
them,	16
and,	16
guessing	16
by	16
the	16
words	16
what	16
the	16
speaker’s	16
intention	16
was,	16
Death	16
in	16
an	16
instant	16
jumped	16
out	16
of	16
the	16
cart,	16
and	16
the	16
emperor,	16
the	16
devil	16
carter	16
and	16
the	16
angel	16
after	16
him,	16
nor	16
did	16
the	16
queen	16
or	16
the	16
god	16
Cupid	16
stay	16
behind;	16
and	16
all	16
armed	16
themselves	16
with	16
stones	16
and	16
formed	16
in	16
line,	16
prepared	16
to	16
receive	16
Don	16
Quixote	16
on	16
the	16
points	16
of	16
their	16
pebbles.	16
Don	16
Quixote,	16
when	16
he	16
saw	16
them	16
drawn	16
up	16
in	16
such	16
a	16
gallant	16
array	16
with	16
uplifted	16
arms	16
ready	16
for	16
a	16
mighty	16
discharge	16
of	16
stones,	16
checked	16
Rocinante	16
and	16
began	16
to	16
consider	16
in	16
what	16
way	16
he	16
could	16
attack	16
them	16
with	16
the	16
least	16
danger	16
to	16
himself.	16
As	16
he	16
halted	16
Sancho	16
came	16
up,	16
and	16
seeing	16
him	16
disposed	16
to	16
attack	16
this	16
well-ordered	16
squadron,	16
said	16
to	16
him,	16
“It	16
would	16
be	16
the	16
height	16
of	16
madness	16
to	16
attempt	16
such	16
an	16
enterprise;	16
remember,	16
señor,	16
that	16
against	16
sops	16
from	16
the	16
brook,	16
and	16
plenty	16
of	16
them,	16
there	16
is	16
no	16
defensive	16
armour	16
in	16
the	16
world,	16
except	16
to	16
stow	16
oneself	16
away	16
under	16
a	16
brass	16
bell;	16
and	16
besides,	16
one	16
should	16
remember	16
that	16
it	16
is	16
rashness,	16
and	16
not	16
valour,	16
for	16
a	16
single	16
man	16
to	16
attack	16
an	16
army	16
that	16
has	16
Death	16
in	16
it,	16
and	16
where	16
emperors	16
fight	16
in	16
person,	16
with	16
angels,	16
good	16
and	16
bad,	16
to	16
help	16
them;	16
and	16
if	16
this	16
reflection	16
will	16
not	16
make	16
you	16
keep	16
quiet,	16
perhaps	16
it	16
will	16
to	16
know	16
for	16
certain	16
that	16
among	16
all	16
these,	16
though	16
they	16
look	16
like	16
kings,	16
princes,	16
and	16
emperors,	16
there	16
is	16
not	16
a	16
single	16
knight-errant.”	16
“Now	16
indeed	16
thou	16
hast	16
hit	16
the	16
point,	16
Sancho,”	16
said	16
Don	16
Quixote,	16
“which	16
may	16
and	16
should	16
turn	16
me	16
from	16
the	16
resolution	16
I	16
had	16
already	16
formed.	16
I	16
cannot	16
and	16
must	16
not	16
draw	16
sword,	16
as	16
I	16
have	16
many	16
a	16
time	16
before	16
told	16
thee,	16
against	16
anyone	16
who	16
is	16
not	16
a	16
dubbed	16
knight;	16
it	16
is	16
for	16
thee,	16
Sancho,	16
if	16
thou	16
wilt,	16
to	16
take	16
vengeance	16
for	16
the	16
wrong	16
done	16
to	16
thy	16
Dapple;	16
and	16
I	16
will	16
help	16
thee	16
from	16
here	16
by	16
shouts	16
and	16
salutary	16
counsels.”	16
“There	16
is	16
no	16
occasion	16
to	16
take	16
vengeance	16
on	16
anyone,	16
señor,”	16
replied	16
Sancho;	16
“for	16
it	16
is	16
not	16
the	16
part	16
of	16
good	16
Christians	16
to	16
revenge	16
wrongs;	16
and	16
besides,	16
I	16
will	16
arrange	16
it	16
with	16
my	16
ass	16
to	16
leave	16
his	16
grievance	16
to	16
my	16
good-will	16
and	16
pleasure,	16
and	16
that	16
is	16
to	16
live	16
in	16
peace	16
as	16
long	16
as	16
heaven	16
grants	16
me	16
life.”	16
“Well,”	16
said	16
Don	16
Quixote,	16
“if	16
that	16
be	16
thy	16
determination,	16
good	16
Sancho,	16
sensible	16
Sancho,	16
Christian	16
Sancho,	16
honest	16
Sancho,	16
let	16
us	16
leave	16
these	16
phantoms	16
alone	16
and	16
turn	16
to	16
the	16
pursuit	16
of	16
better	16
and	16
worthier	16
adventures;	16
for,	16
from	16
what	16
I	16
see	16
of	16
this	16
country,	16
we	16
cannot	16
fail	16
to	16
find	16
plenty	16
of	16
marvellous	16
ones	16
in	16
it.”	16
He	16
at	16
once	16
wheeled	16
about,	16
Sancho	16
ran	16
to	16
take	16
possession	16
of	16
his	16
Dapple,	16
Death	16
and	16
his	16
flying	16
squadron	16
returned	16
to	16
their	16
cart	16
and	16
pursued	16
their	16
journey,	16
and	16
thus	16
the	16
dread	16
adventure	16
of	16
the	16
cart	16
of	16
Death	16
ended	16
happily,	16
thanks	16
to	16
the	16
advice	16
Sancho	16
gave	16
his	16
master;	16
who	16
had,	16
the	16
following	16
day,	16
a	16
fresh	16
adventure,	16
of	16
no	16
less	16
thrilling	16
interest	16
than	16
the	16
last,	16
with	16
an	16
enamoured	16
knight-errant.	16

of	16
the	16
encounter	16
with	16
Death,	16
Don	16
Quixote	16
and	16
his	16
squire	16
passed	16
under	16
some	16
tall	16
shady	16
trees,	16
and	16
Don	16
Quixote	16
at	16
Sancho’s	16
persuasion	16
ate	16
a	16
little	16
from	16
the	16
store	16
carried	16
by	16
Dapple,	16
and	16
over	16
their	16
supper	16
Sancho	16
said	16
to	16
his	16
master,	16
“Señor,	16
what	16
a	16
fool	16
I	16
should	16
have	16
looked	16
if	16
I	16
had	16
chosen	16
for	16
my	16
reward	16
the	16
spoils	16
of	16
the	16
first	16
adventure	16
your	16
worship	16
achieved,	16
instead	16
of	16
the	16
foals	16
of	16
the	16
three	16
mares.	16
After	16
all,	16
‘a	16
sparrow	16
in	16
the	16
hand	16
is	16
better	16
than	16
a	16
vulture	16
on	16
the	16
wing.’”	16
“At	16
the	16
same	16
time,	16
Sancho,”	16
replied	16
Don	16
Quixote,	16
“if	16
thou	16
hadst	16
let	16
me	16
attack	16
them	16
as	16
I	16
wanted,	16
at	16
the	16
very	16
least	16
the	16
emperor’s	16
gold	16
crown	16
and	16
Cupid’s	16
painted	16
wings	16
would	16
have	16
fallen	16
to	16
thee	16
as	16
spoils,	16
for	16
I	16
should	16
have	16
taken	16
them	16
by	16
force	16
and	16
given	16
them	16
into	16
thy	16
hands.”	16
“The	16
sceptres	16
and	16
crowns	16
of	16
those	16
play-actor	16
emperors,”	16
said	16
Sancho,	16
“were	16
never	16
yet	16
pure	16
gold,	16
but	16
only	16
brass	16
foil	16
or	16
tin.”	16
“That	16
is	16
true,”	16
said	16
Don	16
Quixote,	16
“for	16
it	16
would	16
not	16
be	16
right	16
that	16
the	16
accessories	16
of	16
the	16
drama	16
should	16
be	16
real,	16
instead	16
of	16
being	16
mere	16
fictions	16
and	16
semblances,	16
like	16
the	16
drama	16
itself;	16
towards	16
which,	16
Sancho—and,	16
as	16
a	16
necessary	16
consequence,	16
towards	16
those	16
who	16
represent	16
and	16
produce	16
it—I	16
would	16
that	16
thou	16
wert	16
favourably	16
disposed,	16
for	16
they	16
are	16
all	16
instruments	16
of	16
great	16
good	16
to	16
the	16
State,	16
placing	16
before	16
us	16
at	16
every	16
step	16
a	16
mirror	16
in	16
which	16
we	16
may	16
see	16
vividly	16
displayed	16
what	16
goes	16
on	16
in	16
human	16
life;	16
nor	16
is	16
there	16
any	16
similitude	16
that	16
shows	16
us	16
more	16
faithfully	16
what	16
we	16
are	16
and	16
ought	16
to	16
be	16
than	16
the	16
play	16
and	16
the	16
players.	16
Come,	16
tell	16
me,	16
hast	16
thou	16
not	16
seen	16
a	16
play	16
acted	16
in	16
which	16
kings,	16
emperors,	16
pontiffs,	16
knights,	16
ladies,	16
and	16
divers	16
other	16
personages	16
were	16
introduced?	16
One	16
plays	16
the	16
villain,	16
another	16
the	16
knave,	16
this	16
one	16
the	16
merchant,	16
that	16
the	16
soldier,	16
one	16
the	16
sharp-witted	16
fool,	16
another	16
the	16
foolish	16
lover;	16
and	16
when	16
the	16
play	16
is	16
over,	16
and	16
they	16
have	16
put	16
off	16
the	16
dresses	16
they	16
wore	16
in	16
it,	16
all	16
the	16
actors	16
become	16
equal.”	16
“Yes,	16
I	16
have	16
seen	16
that,”	16
said	16
Sancho.	16
“Well	16
then,”	16
said	16
Don	16
Quixote,	16
“the	16
same	16
thing	16
happens	16
in	16
the	16
comedy	16
and	16
life	16
of	16
this	16
world,	16
where	16
some	16
play	16
emperors,	16
others	16
popes,	16
and,	16
in	16
short,	16
all	16
the	16
characters	16
that	16
can	16
be	16
brought	16
into	16
a	16
play;	16
but	16
when	16
it	16
is	16
over,	16
that	16
is	16
to	16
say	16
when	16
life	16
ends,	16
death	16
strips	16
them	16
all	16
of	16
the	16
garments	16
that	16
distinguish	16
one	16
from	16
the	16
other,	16
and	16
all	16
are	16
equal	16
in	16
the	16
grave.”	16
“A	16
fine	16
comparison!”	16
said	16
Sancho;	16
“though	16
not	16
so	16
new	16
but	16
that	16
I	16
have	16
heard	16
it	16
many	16
and	16
many	16
a	16
time,	16
as	16
well	16
as	16
that	16
other	16
one	16
of	16
the	16
game	16
of	16
chess;	16
how,	16
so	16
long	16
as	16
the	16
game	16
lasts,	16
each	16
piece	16
has	16
its	16
own	16
particular	16
office,	16
and	16
when	16
the	16
game	16
is	16
finished	16
they	16
are	16
all	16
mixed,	16
jumbled	16
up	16
and	16
shaken	16
together,	16
and	16
stowed	16
away	16
in	16
the	16
bag,	16
which	16
is	16
much	16
like	16
ending	16
life	16
in	16
the	16
grave.”	16
“Thou	16
art	16
growing	16
less	16
doltish	16
and	16
more	16
shrewd	16
every	16
day,	16
Sancho,”	16
said	16
Don	16
Quixote.	16
“Ay,”	16
said	16
Sancho;	16
“it	16
must	16
be	16
that	16
some	16
of	16
your	16
worship’s	16
shrewdness	16
sticks	16
to	16
me;	16
land	16
that,	16
of	16
itself,	16
is	16
barren	16
and	16
dry,	16
will	16
come	16
to	16
yield	16
good	16
fruit	16
if	16
you	16
dung	16
it	16
and	16
till	16
it;	16
what	16
I	16
mean	16
is	16
that	16
your	16
worship’s	16
conversation	16
has	16
been	16
the	16
dung	16
that	16
has	16
fallen	16
on	16
the	16
barren	16
soil	16
of	16
my	16
dry	16
wit,	16
and	16
the	16
time	16
I	16
have	16
been	16
in	16
your	16
service	16
and	16
society	16
has	16
been	16
the	16
tillage;	16
and	16
with	16
the	16
help	16
of	16
this	16
I	16
hope	16
to	16
yield	16
fruit	16
in	16
abundance	16
that	16
will	16
not	16
fall	16
away	16
or	16
slide	16
from	16
those	16
paths	16
of	16
good	16
breeding	16
that	16
your	16
worship	16
has	16
made	16
in	16
my	16
parched	16
understanding.”	16
Don	16
Quixote	16
laughed	16
at	16
Sancho’s	16
affected	16
phraseology,	16
and	16
perceived	16
that	16
what	16
he	16
said	16
about	16
his	16
improvement	16
was	16
true,	16
for	16
now	16
and	16
then	16
he	16
spoke	16
in	16
a	16
way	16
that	16
surprised	16
him;	16
though	16
always,	16
or	16
mostly,	16
when	16
Sancho	16
tried	16
to	16
talk	16
fine	16
and	16
attempted	16
polite	16
language,	16
he	16
wound	16
up	16
by	16
toppling	16
over	16
from	16
the	16
summit	16
of	16
his	16
simplicity	16
into	16
the	16
abyss	16
of	16
his	16
ignorance;	16
and	16
where	16
he	16
showed	16
his	16
culture	16
and	16
his	16
memory	16
to	16
the	16
greatest	16
advantage	16
was	16
in	16
dragging	16
in	16
proverbs,	16
no	16
matter	16
whether	16
they	16
had	16
any	16
bearing	16
or	16
not	16
upon	16
the	16
subject	16
in	16
hand,	16
as	16
may	16
have	16
been	16
seen	16
already	16
and	16
will	16
be	16
noticed	16
in	16
the	16
course	16
of	16
this	16
history.	16

In	16
conversation	16
of	16
this	16
kind	16
they	16
passed	16
a	16
good	16
part	16
of	16
the	16
night,	16
but	16
Sancho	16
felt	16
a	16
desire	16
to	16
let	16
down	16
the	16
curtains	16
of	16
his	16
eyes,	16
as	16
he	16
used	16
to	16
say	16
when	16
he	16
wanted	16
to	16
go	16
to	16
sleep;	16
and	16
stripping	16
Dapple	16
he	16
left	16
him	16
at	16
liberty	16
to	16
graze	16
his	16
fill.	16
He	16
did	16
not	16
remove	16
Rocinante’s	16
saddle,	16
as	16
his	16
master’s	16
express	16
orders	16
were,	16
that	16
so	16
long	16
as	16
they	16
were	16
in	16
the	16
field	16
or	16
not	16
sleeping	16
under	16
a	16
roof	16
Rocinante	16
was	16
not	16
to	16
be	16
stripped—the	16
ancient	16
usage	16
established	16
and	16
observed	16
by	16
knights-errant	16
being	16
to	16
take	16
off	16
the	16
bridle	16
and	16
hang	16
it	16
on	16
the	16
saddle-bow,	16
but	16
to	16
remove	16
the	16
saddle	16
from	16
the	16
horse—never!	16
Sancho	16
acted	16
accordingly,	16
and	16
gave	16
him	16
the	16
same	16
liberty	16
he	16
had	16
given	16
Dapple,	16
between	16
whom	16
and	16
Rocinante	16
there	16
was	16
a	16
friendship	16
so	16
unequalled	16
and	16
so	16
strong,	16
that	16
it	16
is	16
handed	16
down	16
by	16
tradition	16
from	16
father	16
to	16
son,	16
that	16
the	16
author	16
of	16
this	16
veracious	16
history	16
devoted	16
some	16
special	16
chapters	16
to	16
it,	16
which,	16
in	16
order	16
to	16
preserve	16
the	16
propriety	16
and	16
decorum	16
due	16
to	16
a	16
history	16
so	16
heroic,	16
he	16
did	16
not	16
insert	16
therein;	16
although	16
at	16
times	16
he	16
forgets	16
this	16
resolution	16
of	16
his	16
and	16
describes	16
how	16
eagerly	16
the	16
two	16
beasts	16
would	16
scratch	16
one	16
another	16
when	16
they	16
were	16
together	16
and	16
how,	16
when	16
they	16
were	16
tired	16
or	16
full,	16
Rocinante	16
would	16
lay	16
his	16
neck	16
across	16
Dapple’s,	16
stretching	16
half	16
a	16
yard	16
or	16
more	16
on	16
the	16
other	16
side,	16
and	16
the	16
pair	16
would	16
stand	16
thus,	16
gazing	16
thoughtfully	16
on	16
the	16
ground,	16
for	16
three	16
days,	16
or	16
at	16
least	16
so	16
long	16
as	16
they	16
were	16
left	16
alone,	16
or	16
hunger	16
did	16
not	16
drive	16
them	16
to	16
go	16
and	16
look	16
for	16
food.	16
I	16
may	16
add	16
that	16
they	16
say	16
the	16
author	16
left	16
it	16
on	16
record	16
that	16
he	16
likened	16
their	16
friendship	16
to	16
that	16
of	16
Nisus	16
and	16
Euryalus,	16
and	16
Pylades	16
and	16
Orestes;	16
and	16
if	16
that	16
be	16
so,	16
it	16
may	16
be	16
perceived,	16
to	16
the	16
admiration	16
of	16
mankind,	16
how	16
firm	16
the	16
friendship	16
must	16
have	16
been	16
between	16
these	16
two	16
peaceful	16
animals,	16
shaming	16
men,	16
who	16
preserve	16
friendships	16
with	16
one	16
another	16
so	16
badly.	16
This	16
was	16
why	16
it	16
was	16
said-	16
For	16
friend	16
no	16
longer	16
is	16
there	16
friend;	16
The	16
reeds	16
turn	16
lances	16
now.	16
And	16
someone	16
else	16
has	16
sung—	16
Friend	16
to	16
friend	16
the	16
bug,	16
etc.	16
and	16
let	16
no	16
one	16
fancy	16
that	16
the	16
author	16
was	16
at	16
all	16
astray	16
when	16
he	16
compared	16
the	16
friendship	16
of	16
these	16
animals	16
to	16
that	16
of	16
men;	16
for	16
men	16
have	16
received	16
many	16
lessons	16
from	16
beasts,	16
and	16
learned	16
many	16
important	16
things,	16
as,	16
for	16
example,	16
the	16
clyster	16
from	16
the	16
stork,	16
vomit	16
and	16
gratitude	16
from	16
the	16
dog,	16
watchfulness	16
from	16
the	16
crane,	16
foresight	16
from	16
the	16
ant,	16
modesty	16
from	16
the	16
elephant,	16
and	16
loyalty	16
from	16
the	16
horse.	16
Sancho	16
at	16
last	16
fell	16
asleep	16
at	16
the	16
foot	16
of	16
a	16
cork	16
tree,	16
while	16
Don	16
Quixote	16
dozed	16
at	16
that	16
of	16
a	16
sturdy	16
oak;	16
but	16
a	16
short	16
time	16
only	16
had	16
elapsed	16
when	16
a	16
noise	16
he	16
heard	16
behind	16
him	16
awoke	16
him,	16
and	16
rising	16
up	16
startled,	16
he	16
listened	16
and	16
looked	16
in	16
the	16
direction	16
the	16
noise	16
came	16
from,	16
and	16
perceived	16
two	16
men	16
on	16
horseback,	16
one	16
of	16
whom,	16
letting	16
himself	16
drop	16
from	16
the	16
saddle,	16
said	16
to	16
the	16
other,	16
“Dismount,	16
my	16
friend,	16
and	16
take	16
the	16
bridles	16
off	16
the	16
horses,	16
for,	16
so	16
far	16
as	16
I	16
can	16
see,	16
this	16
place	16
will	16
furnish	16
grass	16
for	16
them,	16
and	16
the	16
solitude	16
and	16
silence	16
my	16
love-sick	16
thoughts	16
need	16
of.”	16
As	16
he	16
said	16
this	16
he	16
stretched	16
himself	16
upon	16
the	16
ground,	16
and	16
as	16
he	16
flung	16
himself	16
down,	16
the	16
armour	16
in	16
which	16
he	16
was	16
clad	16
rattled,	16
whereby	16
Don	16
Quixote	16
perceived	16
that	16
he	16
must	16
be	16
a	16
knight-errant;	16
and	16
going	16
over	16
to	16
Sancho,	16
who	16
was	16
asleep,	16
he	16
shook	16
him	16
by	16
the	16
arm	16
and	16
with	16
no	16
small	16
difficulty	16
brought	16
him	16
back	16
to	16
his	16
senses,	16
and	16
said	16
in	16
a	16
low	16
voice	16
to	16
him,	16
“Brother	16
Sancho,	16
we	16
have	16
got	16
an	16
adventure.”	16
“God	16
send	16
us	16
a	16
good	16
one,”	16
said	16
Sancho;	16
“and	16
where	16
may	16
her	16
ladyship	16
the	16
adventure	16
be?”	16
“Where,	16
Sancho?”	16
replied	16
Don	16
Quixote;	16
“turn	16
thine	16
eyes	16
and	16
look,	16
and	16
thou	16
wilt	16
see	16
stretched	16
there	16
a	16
knight-errant,	16
who,	16
it	16
strikes	16
me,	16
is	16
not	16
over	16
and	16
above	16
happy,	16
for	16
I	16
saw	16
him	16
fling	16
himself	16
off	16
his	16
horse	16
and	16
throw	16
himself	16
on	16
the	16
ground	16
with	16
a	16
certain	16
air	16
of	16
dejection,	16
and	16
his	16
armour	16
rattled	16
as	16
he	16
fell.”	16
“Well,”	16
said	16
Sancho,	16
“how	16
does	16
your	16
worship	16
make	16
out	16
that	16
to	16
be	16
an	16
adventure?”	16
“I	16
do	16
not	16
mean	16
to	16
say,”	16
returned	16
Don	16
Quixote,	16
“that	16
it	16
is	16
a	16
complete	16
adventure,	16
but	16
that	16
it	16
is	16
the	16
beginning	16
of	16
one,	16
for	16
it	16
is	16
in	16
this	16
way	16
adventures	16
begin.	16
But	16
listen,	16
for	16
it	16
seems	16
he	16
is	16
tuning	16
a	16
lute	16
or	16
guitar,	16
and	16
from	16
the	16
way	16
he	16
is	16
spitting	16
and	16
clearing	16
his	16
chest	16
he	16
must	16
be	16
getting	16
ready	16
to	16
sing	16
something.”	16
“Faith,	16
you	16
are	16
right,”	16
said	16
Sancho,	16
“and	16
no	16
doubt	16
he	16
is	16
some	16
enamoured	16
knight.”	16
“There	16
is	16
no	16
knight-errant	16
that	16
is	16
not,”	16
said	16
Don	16
Quixote;	16
“but	16
let	16
us	16
listen	16
to	16
him,	16
for,	16
if	16
he	16
sings,	16
by	16
that	16
thread	16
we	16
shall	16
extract	16
the	16
ball	16
of	16
his	16
thoughts;	16
because	16
out	16
of	16
the	16
abundance	16
of	16
the	16
heart	16
the	16
mouth	16
speaketh.”	16
Sancho	16
was	16
about	16
to	16
reply	16
to	16
his	16
master,	16
but	16
the	16
Knight	16
of	16
the	16
Grove’s	16
voice,	16
which	16
was	16
neither	16
very	16
bad	16
nor	16
very	16
good,	16
stopped	16
him,	16
and	16
listening	16
attentively	16
the	16
pair	16
heard	16
him	16
sing	16
this	16
SONNET	16
Your	16
pleasure,	16
prithee,	16
lady	16
mine,	16
unfold;	16
Declare	16
the	16
terms	16
that	16
I	16
am	16
to	16
obey;	16
My	16
will	16
to	16
yours	16
submissively	16
I	16
mould,	16
And	16
from	16
your	16
law	16
my	16
feet	16
shall	16
never	16
stray.	16
Would	16
you	16
I	16
die,	16
to	16
silent	16
grief	16
a	16
prey?	16
Then	16
count	16
me	16
even	16
now	16
as	16
dead	16
and	16
cold;	16
Would	16
you	16
I	16
tell	16
my	16
woes	16
in	16
some	16
new	16
way?	16
Then	16
shall	16
my	16
tale	16
by	16
Love	16
itself	16
be	16
told.	16
The	16
unison	16
of	16
opposites	16
to	16
prove,	16
Of	16
the	16
soft	16
wax	16
and	16
diamond	16
hard	16
am	16
I;	16
But	16
still,	16
obedient	16
to	16
the	16
laws	16
of	16
love,	16
Here,	16
hard	16
or	16
soft,	16
I	16
offer	16
you	16
my	16
breast,	16
Whate’er	16
you	16
grave	16
or	16
stamp	16
thereon	16
shall	16
rest	16
Indelible	16
for	16
all	16
eternity.	16
With	16
an	16
“Ah	16
me!”	16
that	16
seemed	16
to	16
be	16
drawn	16
from	16
the	16
inmost	16
recesses	16
of	16
his	16
heart,	16
the	16
Knight	16
of	16
the	16
Grove	16
brought	16
his	16
lay	16
to	16
an	16
end,	16
and	16
shortly	16
afterwards	16
exclaimed	16
in	16
a	16
melancholy	16
and	16
piteous	16
voice,	16
“O	16
fairest	16
and	16
most	16
ungrateful	16
woman	16
on	16
earth!	16
What!	16
can	16
it	16
be,	16
most	16
serene	16
Casildea	16
de	16
Vandalia,	16
that	16
thou	16
wilt	16
suffer	16
this	16
thy	16
captive	16
knight	16
to	16
waste	16
away	16
and	16
perish	16
in	16
ceaseless	16
wanderings	16
and	16
rude	16
and	16
arduous	16
toils?	16
It	16
is	16
not	16
enough	16
that	16
I	16
have	16
compelled	16
all	16
the	16
knights	16
of	16
Navarre,	16
all	16
the	16
Leonese,	16
all	16
the	16
Tartesians,	16
all	16
the	16
Castilians,	16
and	16
finally	16
all	16
the	16
knights	16
of	16
La	16
Mancha,	16
to	16
confess	16
thee	16
the	16
most	16
beautiful	16
in	16
the	16
world?”	16
“Not	16
so,”	16
said	16
Don	16
Quixote	16
at	16
this,	16
“for	16
I	16
am	16
of	16
La	16
Mancha,	16
and	16
I	16
have	16
never	16
confessed	16
anything	16
of	16
the	16
sort,	16
nor	16
could	16
I	16
nor	16
should	16
I	16
confess	16
a	16
thing	16
so	16
much	16
to	16
the	16
prejudice	16
of	16
my	16
lady’s	16
beauty;	16
thou	16
seest	16
how	16
this	16
knight	16
is	16
raving,	16
Sancho.	16
But	16
let	16
us	16
listen,	16
perhaps	16
he	16
will	16
tell	16
us	16
more	16
about	16
himself.”	16
“That	16
he	16
will,”	16
returned	16
Sancho,	16
“for	16
he	16
seems	16
in	16
a	16
mood	16
to	16
bewail	16
himself	16
for	16
a	16
month	16
at	16
a	16
stretch.”	16
But	16
this	16
was	16
not	16
the	16
case,	16
for	16
the	16
Knight	16
of	16
the	16
Grove,	16
hearing	16
voices	16
near	16
him,	16
instead	16
of	16
continuing	16
his	16
lamentation,	16
stood	16
up	16
and	16
exclaimed	16
in	16
a	16
distinct	16
but	16
courteous	16
tone,	16
“Who	16
goes	16
there?	16
What	16
are	16
you?	16
Do	16
you	16
belong	16
to	16
the	16
number	16
of	16
the	16
happy	16
or	16
of	16
the	16
miserable?”	16
“Of	16
the	16
miserable,”	16
answered	16
Don	16
Quixote.	16
“Then	16
come	16
to	16
me,”	16
said	16
he	16
of	16
the	16
Grove,	16
“and	16
rest	16
assured	16
that	16
it	16
is	16
to	16
woe	16
itself	16
and	16
affliction	16
itself	16
you	16
come.”	16
Don	16
Quixote,	16
finding	16
himself	16
answered	16
in	16
such	16
a	16
soft	16
and	16
courteous	16
manner,	16
went	16
over	16
to	16
him,	16
and	16
so	16
did	16
Sancho.	16
The	16
doleful	16
knight	16
took	16
Don	16
Quixote	16
by	16
the	16
arm,	16
saying,	16
“Sit	16
down	16
here,	16
sir	16
knight;	16
for,	16
that	16
you	16
are	16
one,	16
and	16
of	16
those	16
that	16
profess	16
knight-errantry,	16
it	16
is	16
to	16
me	16
a	16
sufficient	16
proof	16
to	16
have	16
found	16
you	16
in	16
this	16
place,	16
where	16
solitude	16
and	16
night,	16
the	16
natural	16
couch	16
and	16
proper	16
retreat	16
of	16
knights-errant,	16
keep	16
you	16
company.”	16
To	16
which	16
Don	16
made	16
answer,	16
“A	16
knight	16
I	16
am	16
of	16
the	16
profession	16
you	16
mention,	16
and	16
though	16
sorrows,	16
misfortunes,	16
and	16
calamities	16
have	16
made	16
my	16
heart	16
their	16
abode,	16
the	16
compassion	16
I	16
feel	16
for	16
the	16
misfortunes	16
of	16
others	16
has	16
not	16
been	16
thereby	16
banished	16
from	16
it.	16
From	16
what	16
you	16
have	16
just	16
now	16
sung	16
I	16
gather	16
that	16
yours	16
spring	16
from	16
love,	16
I	16
mean	16
from	16
the	16
love	16
you	16
bear	16
that	16
fair	16
ingrate	16
you	16
named	16
in	16
your	16
lament.”	16
In	16
the	16
meantime,	16
they	16
had	16
seated	16
themselves	16
together	16
on	16
the	16
hard	16
ground	16
peaceably	16
and	16
sociably,	16
just	16
as	16
if,	16
as	16
soon	16
as	16
day	16
broke,	16
they	16
were	16
not	16
going	16
to	16
break	16
one	16
another’s	16
heads.	16
“Are	16
you,	16
sir	16
knight,	16
in	16
love	16
perchance?”	16
asked	16
he	16
of	16
the	16
Grove	16
of	16
Don	16
Quixote.	16
“By	16
mischance	16
I	16
am,”	16
replied	16
Don	16
Quixote;	16
“though	16
the	16
ills	16
arising	16
from	16
well-bestowed	16
affections	16
should	16
be	16
esteemed	16
favours	16
rather	16
than	16
misfortunes.”	16
“That	16
is	16
true,”	16
returned	16
he	16
of	16
the	16
Grove,	16
“if	16
scorn	16
did	16
not	16
unsettle	16
our	16
reason	16
and	16
understanding,	16
for	16
if	16
it	16
be	16
excessive	16
it	16
looks	16
like	16
revenge.”	16
“I	16
was	16
never	16
scorned	16
by	16
my	16
lady,”	16
said	16
Don	16
Quixote.	16
“Certainly	16
not,”	16
said	16
Sancho,	16
who	16
stood	16
close	16
by,	16
“for	16
my	16
lady	16
is	16
as	16
a	16
lamb,	16
and	16
softer	16
than	16
a	16
roll	16
of	16
butter.”	16
“Is	16
this	16
your	16
squire?”	16
asked	16
he	16
of	16
the	16
Grove.	16
“He	16
is,”	16
said	16
Don	16
Quixote.	16
“I	16
never	16
yet	16
saw	16
a	16
squire,”	16
said	16
he	16
of	16
the	16
Grove,	16
“who	16
ventured	16
to	16
speak	16
when	16
his	16
master	16
was	16
speaking;	16
at	16
least,	16
there	16
is	16
mine,	16
who	16
is	16
as	16
big	16
as	16
his	16
father,	16
and	16
it	16
cannot	16
be	16
proved	16
that	16
he	16
has	16
ever	16
opened	16
his	16
lips	16
when	16
I	16
am	16
speaking.”	16
“By	16
my	16
faith	16
then,”	16
said	16
Sancho,	16
“I	16
have	16
spoken,	16
and	16
am	16
fit	16
to	16
speak,	16
in	16
the	16
presence	16
of	16
one	16
as	16
much,	16
or	16
even—but	16
never	16
mind—it	16
only	16
makes	16
it	16
worse	16
to	16
stir	16
it.”	16
The	16
squire	16
of	16
the	16
Grove	16
took	16
Sancho	16
by	16
the	16
arm,	16
saying	16
to	16
him,	16
“Let	16
us	16
two	16
go	16
where	16
we	16
can	16
talk	16
in	16
squire	16
style	16
as	16
much	16
as	16
we	16
please,	16
and	16
leave	16
these	16
gentlemen	16
our	16
masters	16
to	16
fight	16
it	16
out	16
over	16
the	16
story	16
of	16
their	16
loves;	16
and,	16
depend	16
upon	16
it,	16
daybreak	16
will	16
find	16
them	16
at	16
it	16
without	16
having	16
made	16
an	16
end	16
of	16
it.”	16
“So	16
be	16
it	16
by	16
all	16
means,”	16
said	16
Sancho;	16
“and	16
I	16
will	16
tell	16
your	16
worship	16
who	16
I	16
am,	16
that	16
you	16
may	16
see	16
whether	16
I	16
am	16
to	16
be	16
reckoned	16
among	16
the	16
number	16
of	16
the	16
most	16
talkative	16
squires.”	16
With	16
this	16
the	16
two	16
squires	16
withdrew	16
to	16
one	16
side,	16
and	16
between	16
them	16
there	16
passed	16
a	16
conversation	16
as	16
droll	16
as	16
that	16
which	16
passed	16
between	16
their	16
masters	16
was	16
serious.	16

(126K)	16
Full	16
Size	16
The	16
knights	16
and	16
the	16
squires	16
made	16
two	16
parties,	16
these	16
telling	16
the	16
story	16
of	16
their	16
lives,	16
the	16
others	16
the	16
story	16
of	16
their	16
loves;	16
but	16
the	16
history	16
relates	16
first	16
of	16
all	16
the	16
conversation	16
of	16
the	16
servants,	16
and	16
afterwards	16
takes	16
up	16
that	16
of	16
the	16
masters;	16
and	16
it	16
says	16
that,	16
withdrawing	16
a	16
little	16
from	16
the	16
others,	16
he	16
of	16
the	16
Grove	16
said	16
to	16
Sancho,	16
“A	16
hard	16
life	16
it	16
is	16
we	16
lead	16
and	16
live,	16
señor,	16
we	16
that	16
are	16
squires	16
to	16
knights-errant;	16
verily,	16
we	16
eat	16
our	16
bread	16
in	16
the	16
sweat	16
of	16
our	16
faces,	16
which	16
is	16
one	16
of	16
the	16
curses	16
God	16
laid	16
on	16
our	16
first	16
parents.”	16
“It	16
may	16
be	16
said,	16
too,”	16
added	16
Sancho,	16
“that	16
we	16
eat	16
it	16
in	16
the	16
chill	16
of	16
our	16
bodies;	16
for	16
who	16
gets	16
more	16
heat	16
and	16
cold	16
than	16
the	16
miserable	16
squires	16
of	16
knight-errantry?	16
Even	16
so	16
it	16
would	16
not	16
be	16
so	16
bad	16
if	16
we	16
had	16
something	16
to	16
eat,	16
for	16
woes	16
are	16
lighter	16
if	16
there’s	16
bread;	16
but	16
sometimes	16
we	16
go	16
a	16
day	16
or	16
two	16
without	16
breaking	16
our	16
fast,	16
except	16
with	16
the	16
wind	16
that	16
blows.”	16
“All	16
that,”	16
said	16
he	16
of	16
the	16
Grove,	16
“may	16
be	16
endured	16
and	16
put	16
up	16
with	16
when	16
we	16
have	16
hopes	16
of	16
reward;	16
for,	16
unless	16
the	16
knight-errant	16
he	16
serves	16
is	16
excessively	16
unlucky,	16
after	16
a	16
few	16
turns	16
the	16
squire	16
will	16
at	16
least	16
find	16
himself	16
rewarded	16
with	16
a	16
fine	16
government	16
of	16
some	16
island	16
or	16
some	16
fair	16
county.”	16
“I,”	16
said	16
Sancho,	16
“have	16
already	16
told	16
my	16
master	16
that	16
I	16
shall	16
be	16
content	16
with	16
the	16
government	16
of	16
some	16
island,	16
and	16
he	16
is	16
so	16
noble	16
and	16
generous	16
that	16
he	16
has	16
promised	16
it	16
to	16
me	16
ever	16
so	16
many	16
times.”	16
“I,”	16
said	16
he	16
of	16
the	16
Grove,	16
“shall	16
be	16
satisfied	16
with	16
a	16
canonry	16
for	16
my	16
services,	16
and	16
my	16
master	16
has	16
already	16
assigned	16
me	16
one.”	16
“Your	16
master,”	16
said	16
Sancho,	16
“no	16
doubt	16
is	16
a	16
knight	16
in	16
the	16
Church	16
line,	16
and	16
can	16
bestow	16
rewards	16
of	16
that	16
sort	16
on	16
his	16
good	16
squire;	16
but	16
mine	16
is	16
only	16
a	16
layman;	16
though	16
I	16
remember	16
some	16
clever,	16
but,	16
to	16
my	16
mind,	16
designing	16
people,	16
strove	16
to	16
persuade	16
him	16
to	16
try	16
and	16
become	16
an	16
archbishop.	16
He,	16
however,	16
would	16
not	16
be	16
anything	16
but	16
an	16
emperor;	16
but	16
I	16
was	16
trembling	16
all	16
the	16
time	16
lest	16
he	16
should	16
take	16
a	16
fancy	16
to	16
go	16
into	16
the	16
Church,	16
not	16
finding	16
myself	16
fit	16
to	16
hold	16
office	16
in	16
it;	16
for	16
I	16
may	16
tell	16
you,	16
though	16
I	16
seem	16
a	16
man,	16
I	16
am	16
no	16
better	16
than	16
a	16
beast	16
for	16
the	16
Church.”	16
“Well,	16
then,	16
you	16
are	16
wrong	16
there,”	16
said	16
he	16
of	16
the	16
Grove;	16
“for	16
those	16
island	16
governments	16
are	16
not	16
all	16
satisfactory;	16
some	16
are	16
awkward,	16
some	16
are	16
poor,	16
some	16
are	16
dull,	16
and,	16
in	16
short,	16
the	16
highest	16
and	16
choicest	16
brings	16
with	16
it	16
a	16
heavy	16
burden	16
of	16
cares	16
and	16
troubles	16
which	16
the	16
unhappy	16
wight	16
to	16
whose	16
lot	16
it	16
has	16
fallen	16
bears	16
upon	16
his	16
shoulders.	16
Far	16
better	16
would	16
it	16
be	16
for	16
us	16
who	16
have	16
adopted	16
this	16
accursed	16
service	16
to	16
go	16
back	16
to	16
our	16
own	16
houses,	16
and	16
there	16
employ	16
ourselves	16
in	16
pleasanter	16
occupations—in	16
hunting	16
or	16
fishing,	16
for	16
instance;	16
for	16
what	16
squire	16
in	16
the	16
world	16
is	16
there	16
so	16
poor	16
as	16
not	16
to	16
have	16
a	16
hack	16
and	16
a	16
couple	16
of	16
greyhounds	16
and	16
a	16
fishingrod	16
to	16
amuse	16
himself	16
with	16
in	16
his	16
own	16
village?”	16
“I	16
am	16
not	16
in	16
want	16
of	16
any	16
of	16
those	16
things,”	16
said	16
Sancho;	16
“to	16
be	16
sure	16
I	16
have	16
no	16
hack,	16
but	16
I	16
have	16
an	16
ass	16
that	16
is	16
worth	16
my	16
master’s	16
horse	16
twice	16
over;	16
God	16
send	16
me	16
a	16
bad	16
Easter,	16
and	16
that	16
the	16
next	16
one	16
I	16
am	16
to	16
see,	16
if	16
I	16
would	16
swap,	16
even	16
if	16
I	16
got	16
four	16
bushels	16
of	16
barley	16
to	16
boot.	16
You	16
will	16
laugh	16
at	16
the	16
value	16
I	16
put	16
on	16
my	16
Dapple—for	16
dapple	16
is	16
the	16
colour	16
of	16
my	16
beast.	16
As	16
to	16
greyhounds,	16
I	16
can’t	16
want	16
for	16
them,	16
for	16
there	16
are	16
enough	16
and	16
to	16
spare	16
in	16
my	16
town;	16
and,	16
moreover,	16
there	16
is	16
more	16
pleasure	16
in	16
sport	16
when	16
it	16
is	16
at	16
other	16
people’s	16
expense.”	16
“In	16
truth	16
and	16
earnest,	16
sir	16
squire,”	16
said	16
he	16
of	16
the	16
Grove,	16
“I	16
have	16
made	16
up	16
my	16
mind	16
and	16
determined	16
to	16
have	16
done	16
with	16
these	16
drunken	16
vagaries	16
of	16
these	16
knights,	16
and	16
go	16
back	16
to	16
my	16
village,	16
and	16
bring	16
up	16
my	16
children;	16
for	16
I	16
have	16
three,	16
like	16
three	16
Oriental	16
pearls.”	16
“I	16
have	16
two,”	16
said	16
Sancho,	16
“that	16
might	16
be	16
presented	16
before	16
the	16
Pope	16
himself,	16
especially	16
a	16
girl	16
whom	16
I	16
am	16
breeding	16
up	16
for	16
a	16
countess,	16
please	16
God,	16
though	16
in	16
spite	16
of	16
her	16
mother.”	16
“And	16
how	16
old	16
is	16
this	16
lady	16
that	16
is	16
being	16
bred	16
up	16
for	16
a	16
countess?”	16
asked	16
he	16
of	16
the	16
Grove.	16
“Fifteen,	16
a	16
couple	16
of	16
years	16
more	16
or	16
less,”	16
answered	16
Sancho;	16
“but	16
she	16
is	16
as	16
tall	16
as	16
a	16
lance,	16
and	16
as	16
fresh	16
as	16
an	16
April	16
morning,	16
and	16
as	16
strong	16
as	16
a	16
porter.”	16
“Those	16
are	16
gifts	16
to	16
fit	16
her	16
to	16
be	16
not	16
only	16
a	16
countess	16
but	16
a	16
nymph	16
of	16
the	16
greenwood,”	16
said	16
he	16
of	16
the	16
Grove;	16
“whoreson	16
strumpet!	16
what	16
pith	16
the	16
rogue	16
must	16
have!”	16
To	16
which	16
Sancho	16
made	16
answer,	16
somewhat	16
sulkily,	16
“She’s	16
no	16
strumpet,	16
nor	16
was	16
her	16
mother,	16
nor	16
will	16
either	16
of	16
them	16
be,	16
please	16
God,	16
while	16
I	16
live;	16
speak	16
more	16
civilly;	16
for	16
one	16
bred	16
up	16
among	16
knights-errant,	16
who	16
are	16
courtesy	16
itself,	16
your	16
words	16
don’t	16
seem	16
to	16
me	16
to	16
be	16
very	16
becoming.”	16
“O	16
how	16
little	16
you	16
know	16
about	16
compliments,	16
sir	16
squire,”	16
returned	16
he	16
of	16
the	16
Grove.	16
“What!	16
don’t	16
you	16
know	16
that	16
when	16
a	16
horseman	16
delivers	16
a	16
good	16
lance	16
thrust	16
at	16
the	16
bull	16
in	16
the	16
plaza,	16
or	16
when	16
anyone	16
does	16
anything	16
very	16
well,	16
the	16
people	16
are	16
wont	16
to	16
say,	16
‘Ha,	16
whoreson	16
rip!	16
how	16
well	16
he	16
has	16
done	16
it!’	16
and	16
that	16
what	16
seems	16
to	16
be	16
abuse	16
in	16
the	16
expression	16
is	16
high	16
praise?	16
Disown	16
sons	16
and	16
daughters,	16
señor,	16
who	16
don’t	16
do	16
what	16
deserves	16
that	16
compliments	16
of	16
this	16
sort	16
should	16
be	16
paid	16
to	16
their	16
parents.”	16
“I	16
do	16
disown	16
them,”	16
replied	16
Sancho,	16
“and	16
in	16
this	16
way,	16
and	16
by	16
the	16
same	16
reasoning,	16
you	16
might	16
call	16
me	16
and	16
my	16
children	16
and	16
my	16
wife	16
all	16
the	16
strumpets	16
in	16
the	16
world,	16
for	16
all	16
they	16
do	16
and	16
say	16
is	16
of	16
a	16
kind	16
that	16
in	16
the	16
highest	16
degree	16
deserves	16
the	16
same	16
praise;	16
and	16
to	16
see	16
them	16
again	16
I	16
pray	16
God	16
to	16
deliver	16
me	16
from	16
mortal	16
sin,	16
or,	16
what	16
comes	16
to	16
the	16
same	16
thing,	16
to	16
deliver	16
me	16
from	16
this	16
perilous	16
calling	16
of	16
squire	16
into	16
which	16
I	16
have	16
fallen	16
a	16
second	16
time,	16
decayed	16
and	16
beguiled	16
by	16
a	16
purse	16
with	16
a	16
hundred	16
ducats	16
that	16
I	16
found	16
one	16
day	16
in	16
the	16
heart	16
of	16
the	16
Sierra	16
Morena;	16
and	16
the	16
devil	16
is	16
always	16
putting	16
a	16
bag	16
full	16
of	16
doubloons	16
before	16
my	16
eyes,	16
here,	16
there,	16
everywhere,	16
until	16
I	16
fancy	16
at	16
every	16
stop	16
I	16
am	16
putting	16
my	16
hand	16
on	16
it,	16
and	16
hugging	16
it,	16
and	16
carrying	16
it	16
home	16
with	16
me,	16
and	16
making	16
investments,	16
and	16
getting	16
interest,	16
and	16
living	16
like	16
a	16
prince;	16
and	16
so	16
long	16
as	16
I	16
think	16
of	16
this	16
I	16
make	16
light	16
of	16
all	16
the	16
hardships	16
I	16
endure	16
with	16
this	16
simpleton	16
of	16
a	16
master	16
of	16
mine,	16
who,	16
I	16
well	16
know,	16
is	16
more	16
of	16
a	16
madman	16
than	16
a	16
knight.”	16
“There’s	16
why	16
they	16
say	16
that	16
‘covetousness	16
bursts	16
the	16
bag,’”	16
said	16
he	16
of	16
the	16
Grove;	16
“but	16
if	16
you	16
come	16
to	16
talk	16
of	16
that	16
sort,	16
there	16
is	16
not	16
a	16
greater	16
one	16
in	16
the	16
world	16
than	16
my	16
master,	16
for	16
he	16
is	16
one	16
of	16
those	16
of	16
whom	16
they	16
say,	16
‘the	16
cares	16
of	16
others	16
kill	16
the	16
ass;’	16
for,	16
in	16
order	16
that	16
another	16
knight	16
may	16
recover	16
the	16
senses	16
he	16
has	16
lost,	16
he	16
makes	16
a	16
madman	16
of	16
himself	16
and	16
goes	16
looking	16
for	16
what,	16
when	16
found,	16
may,	16
for	16
all	16
I	16
know,	16
fly	16
in	16
his	16
own	16
face.”	16
“And	16
is	16
he	16
in	16
love	16
perchance?”	16
asked	16
Sancho.	16
“He	16
is,”	16
said	16
of	16
the	16
Grove,	16
“with	16
one	16
Casildea	16
de	16
Vandalia,	16
the	16
rawest	16
and	16
best	16
roasted	16
lady	16
the	16
whole	16
world	16
could	16
produce;	16
but	16
that	16
rawness	16
is	16
not	16
the	16
only	16
foot	16
he	16
limps	16
on,	16
for	16
he	16
has	16
greater	16
schemes	16
rumbling	16
in	16
his	16
bowels,	16
as	16
will	16
be	16
seen	16
before	16
many	16
hours	16
are	16
over.”	16
“There’s	16
no	16
road	16
so	16
smooth	16
but	16
it	16
has	16
some	16
hole	16
or	16
hindrance	16
in	16
it,”	16
said	16
Sancho;	16
“in	16
other	16
houses	16
they	16
cook	16
beans,	16
but	16
in	16
mine	16
it’s	16
by	16
the	16
potful;	16
madness	16
will	16
have	16
more	16
followers	16
and	16
hangers-on	16
than	16
sound	16
sense;	16
but	16
if	16
there	16
be	16
any	16
truth	16
in	16
the	16
common	16
saying,	16
that	16
to	16
have	16
companions	16
in	16
trouble	16
gives	16
some	16
relief,	16
I	16
may	16
take	16
consolation	16
from	16
you,	16
inasmuch	16
as	16
you	16
serve	16
a	16
master	16
as	16
crazy	16
as	16
my	16
own.”	16
“Crazy	16
but	16
valiant,”	16
replied	16
he	16
of	16
the	16
Grove,	16
“and	16
more	16
roguish	16
than	16
crazy	16
or	16
valiant.”	16
“Mine	16
is	16
not	16
that,”	16
said	16
Sancho;	16
“I	16
mean	16
he	16
has	16
nothing	16
of	16
the	16
rogue	16
in	16
him;	16
on	16
the	16
contrary,	16
he	16
has	16
the	16
soul	16
of	16
a	16
pitcher;	16
he	16
has	16
no	16
thought	16
of	16
doing	16
harm	16
to	16
anyone,	16
only	16
good	16
to	16
all,	16
nor	16
has	16
he	16
any	16
malice	16
whatever	16
in	16
him;	16
a	16
child	16
might	16
persuade	16
him	16
that	16
it	16
is	16
night	16
at	16
noonday;	16
and	16
for	16
this	16
simplicity	16
I	16
love	16
him	16
as	16
the	16
core	16
of	16
my	16
heart,	16
and	16
I	16
can’t	16
bring	16
myself	16
to	16
leave	16
him,	16
let	16
him	16
do	16
ever	16
such	16
foolish	16
things.”	16
“For	16
all	16
that,	16
brother	16
and	16
señor,”	16
said	16
he	16
of	16
the	16
Grove,	16
“if	16
the	16
blind	16
lead	16
the	16
blind,	16
both	16
are	16
in	16
danger	16
of	16
falling	16
into	16
the	16
pit.	16
It	16
is	16
better	16
for	16
us	16
to	16
beat	16
a	16
quiet	16
retreat	16
and	16
get	16
back	16
to	16
our	16
own	16
quarters;	16
for	16
those	16
who	16
seek	16
adventures	16
don’t	16
always	16
find	16
good	16
ones.”	16
Sancho	16
kept	16
spitting	16
from	16
time	16
to	16
time,	16
and	16
his	16
spittle	16
seemed	16
somewhat	16
ropy	16
and	16
dry,	16
observing	16
which	16
the	16
compassionate	16
squire	16
of	16
the	16
Grove	16
said,	16
“It	16
seems	16
to	16
me	16
that	16
with	16
all	16
this	16
talk	16
of	16
ours	16
our	16
tongues	16
are	16
sticking	16
to	16
the	16
roofs	16
of	16
our	16
mouths;	16
but	16
I	16
have	16
a	16
pretty	16
good	16
loosener	16
hanging	16
from	16
the	16
saddle-bow	16
of	16
my	16
horse,”	16
and	16
getting	16
up	16
he	16
came	16
back	16
the	16
next	16
minute	16
with	16
a	16
large	16
bota	16
of	16
wine	16
and	16
a	16
pasty	16
half	16
a	16
yard	16
across;	16
and	16
this	16
is	16
no	16
exaggeration,	16
for	16
it	16
was	16
made	16
of	16
a	16
house	16
rabbit	16
so	16
big	16
that	16
Sancho,	16
as	16
he	16
handled	16
it,	16
took	16
it	16
to	16
be	16
made	16
of	16
a	16
goat,	16
not	16
to	16
say	16
a	16
kid,	16
and	16
looking	16
at	16
it	16
he	16
said,	16
“And	16
do	16
you	16
carry	16
this	16
with	16
you,	16
señor?”	16
“Why,	16
what	16
are	16
you	16
thinking	16
about?”	16
said	16
the	16
other;	16
“do	16
you	16
take	16
me	16
for	16
some	16
paltry	16
squire?	16
I	16
carry	16
a	16
better	16
larder	16
on	16
my	16
horse’s	16
croup	16
than	16
a	16
general	16
takes	16
with	16
him	16
when	16
he	16
goes	16
on	16
a	16
march.”	16
Sancho	16
ate	16
without	16
requiring	16
to	16
be	16
pressed,	16
and	16
in	16
the	16
dark	16
bolted	16
mouthfuls	16
like	16
the	16
knots	16
on	16
a	16
tether,	16
and	16
said	16
he,	16
“You	16
are	16
a	16
proper	16
trusty	16
squire,	16
one	16
of	16
the	16
right	16
sort,	16
sumptuous	16
and	16
grand,	16
as	16
this	16
banquet	16
shows,	16
which,	16
if	16
it	16
has	16
not	16
come	16
here	16
by	16
magic	16
art,	16
at	16
any	16
rate	16
has	16
the	16
look	16
of	16
it;	16
not	16
like	16
me,	16
unlucky	16
beggar,	16
that	16
have	16
nothing	16
more	16
in	16
my	16
alforjas	16
than	16
a	16
scrap	16
of	16
cheese,	16
so	16
hard	16
that	16
one	16
might	16
brain	16
a	16
giant	16
with	16
it,	16
and,	16
to	16
keep	16
it	16
company,	16
a	16
few	16
dozen	16
carobs	16
and	16
as	16
many	16
more	16
filberts	16
and	16
walnuts;	16
thanks	16
to	16
the	16
austerity	16
of	16
my	16
master,	16
and	16
the	16
idea	16
he	16
has	16
and	16
the	16
rule	16
he	16
follows,	16
that	16
knights-errant	16
must	16
not	16
live	16
or	16
sustain	16
themselves	16
on	16
anything	16
except	16
dried	16
fruits	16
and	16
the	16
herbs	16
of	16
the	16
field.”	16
“By	16
my	16
faith,	16
brother,”	16
said	16
he	16
of	16
the	16
Grove,	16
“my	16
stomach	16
is	16
not	16
made	16
for	16
thistles,	16
or	16
wild	16
pears,	16
or	16
roots	16
of	16
the	16
woods;	16
let	16
our	16
masters	16
do	16
as	16
they	16
like,	16
with	16
their	16
chivalry	16
notions	16
and	16
laws,	16
and	16
eat	16
what	16
those	16
enjoin;	16
I	16
carry	16
my	16
prog-basket	16
and	16
this	16
bota	16
hanging	16
to	16
the	16
saddle-bow,	16
whatever	16
they	16
may	16
say;	16
and	16
it	16
is	16
such	16
an	16
object	16
of	16
worship	16
with	16
me,	16
and	16
I	16
love	16
it	16
so,	16
that	16
there	16
is	16
hardly	16
a	16
moment	16
but	16
I	16
am	16
kissing	16
and	16
embracing	16
it	16
over	16
and	16
over	16
again;”	16
and	16
so	16
saying	16
he	16
thrust	16
it	16
into	16
Sancho’s	16
hands,	16
who	16
raising	16
it	16
aloft	16
pointed	16
to	16
his	16
mouth,	16
gazed	16
at	16
the	16
stars	16
for	16
a	16
quarter	16
of	16
an	16
hour;	16
and	16
when	16
he	16
had	16
done	16
drinking	16
let	16
his	16
head	16
fall	16
on	16
one	16
side,	16
and	16
giving	16
a	16
deep	16
sigh,	16
exclaimed,	16
“Ah,	16
whoreson	16
rogue,	16
how	16
catholic	16
it	16
is!”	16
“There,	16
you	16
see,”	16
said	16
he	16
of	16
the	16
Grove,	16
hearing	16
Sancho’s	16
exclamation,	16
“how	16
you	16
have	16
called	16
this	16
wine	16
whoreson	16
by	16
way	16
of	16
praise.”	16
“Well,”	16
said	16
Sancho,	16
“I	16
own	16
it,	16
and	16
I	16
grant	16
it	16
is	16
no	16
dishonour	16
to	16
call	16
anyone	16
whoreson	16
when	16
it	16
is	16
to	16
be	16
understood	16
as	16
praise.	16
But	16
tell	16
me,	16
señor,	16
by	16
what	16
you	16
love	16
best,	16
is	16
this	16
Ciudad	16
Real	16
wine?”	16
“O	16
rare	16
wine-taster!”	16
said	16
he	16
of	16
the	16
Grove;	16
“nowhere	16
else	16
indeed	16
does	16
it	16
come	16
from,	16
and	16
it	16
has	16
some	16
years’	16
age	16
too.”	16
“Leave	16
me	16
alone	16
for	16
that,”	16
said	16
Sancho;	16
“never	16
fear	16
but	16
I’ll	16
hit	16
upon	16
the	16
place	16
it	16
came	16
from	16
somehow.	16
What	16
would	16
you	16
say,	16
sir	16
squire,	16
to	16
my	16
having	16
such	16
a	16
great	16
natural	16
instinct	16
in	16
judging	16
wines	16
that	16
you	16
have	16
only	16
to	16
let	16
me	16
smell	16
one	16
and	16
I	16
can	16
tell	16
positively	16
its	16
country,	16
its	16
kind,	16
its	16
flavour	16
and	16
soundness,	16
the	16
changes	16
it	16
will	16
undergo,	16
and	16
everything	16
that	16
appertains	16
to	16
a	16
wine?	16
But	16
it	16
is	16
no	16
wonder,	16
for	16
I	16
have	16
had	16
in	16
my	16
family,	16
on	16
my	16
father’s	16
side,	16
the	16
two	16
best	16
wine-tasters	16
that	16
have	16
been	16
known	16
in	16
La	16
Mancha	16
for	16
many	16
a	16
long	16
year,	16
and	16
to	16
prove	16
it	16
I’ll	16
tell	16
you	16
now	16
a	16
thing	16
that	16
happened	16
them.	16
They	16
gave	16
the	16
two	16
of	16
them	16
some	16
wine	16
out	16
of	16
a	16
cask,	16
to	16
try,	16
asking	16
their	16
opinion	16
as	16
to	16
the	16
condition,	16
quality,	16
goodness	16
or	16
badness	16
of	16
the	16
wine.	16
One	16
of	16
them	16
tried	16
it	16
with	16
the	16
tip	16
of	16
his	16
tongue,	16
the	16
other	16
did	16
no	16
more	16
than	16
bring	16
it	16
to	16
his	16
nose.	16
The	16
first	16
said	16
the	16
wine	16
had	16
a	16
flavour	16
of	16
iron,	16
the	16
second	16
said	16
it	16
had	16
a	16
stronger	16
flavour	16
of	16
cordovan.	16
The	16
owner	16
said	16
the	16
cask	16
was	16
clean,	16
and	16
that	16
nothing	16
had	16
been	16
added	16
to	16
the	16
wine	16
from	16
which	16
it	16
could	16
have	16
got	16
a	16
flavour	16
of	16
either	16
iron	16
or	16
leather.	16
Nevertheless,	16
these	16
two	16
great	16
wine-tasters	16
held	16
to	16
what	16
they	16
had	16
said.	16
Time	16
went	16
by,	16
the	16
wine	16
was	16
sold,	16
and	16
when	16
they	16
came	16
to	16
clean	16
out	16
the	16
cask,	16
they	16
found	16
in	16
it	16
a	16
small	16
key	16
hanging	16
to	16
a	16
thong	16
of	16
cordovan;	16
see	16
now	16
if	16
one	16
who	16
comes	16
of	16
the	16
same	16
stock	16
has	16
not	16
a	16
right	16
to	16
give	16
his	16
opinion	16
in	16
such	16
like	16
cases.”	16
“Therefore,	16
I	16
say,”	16
said	16
he	16
of	16
the	16
Grove,	16
“let	16
us	16
give	16
up	16
going	16
in	16
quest	16
of	16
adventures,	16
and	16
as	16
we	16
have	16
loaves	16
let	16
us	16
not	16
go	16
looking	16
for	16
cakes,	16
but	16
return	16
to	16
our	16
cribs,	16
for	16
God	16
will	16
find	16
us	16
there	16
if	16
it	16
be	16
his	16
will.”	16
“Until	16
my	16
master	16
reaches	16
Saragossa,”	16
said	16
Sancho,	16
“I’ll	16
remain	16
in	16
his	16
service;	16
after	16
that	16
we’ll	16
see.”	16
The	16
end	16
of	16
it	16
was	16
that	16
the	16
two	16
squires	16
talked	16
so	16
much	16
and	16
drank	16
so	16
much	16
that	16
sleep	16
had	16
to	16
tie	16
their	16
tongues	16
and	16
moderate	16
their	16
thirst,	16
for	16
to	16
quench	16
it	16
was	16
impossible;	16
and	16
so	16
the	16
pair	16
of	16
them	16
fell	16
asleep	16
clinging	16
to	16
the	16
now	16
nearly	16
empty	16
bota	16
and	16
with	16
half-chewed	16
morsels	16
in	16
their	16
mouths;	16
and	16
there	16
we	16
will	16
leave	16
them	16
for	16
the	16
present,	16
to	16
relate	16
what	16
passed	16
between	16
the	16
Knight	16
of	16
the	16
Grove	16
and	16
him	16
of	16
the	16
Rueful	16
Countenance.	16

and	16
the	16
Knight	16
of	16
the	16
Wood,	16
the	16
history	16
tells	16
us	16
he	16
of	16
the	16
Grove	16
said	16
to	16
Don	16
Quixote,	16
“In	16
fine,	16
sir	16
knight,	16
I	16
would	16
have	16
you	16
know	16
that	16
my	16
destiny,	16
or,	16
more	16
properly	16
speaking,	16
my	16
choice	16
led	16
me	16
to	16
fall	16
in	16
love	16
with	16
the	16
peerless	16
Casildea	16
de	16
Vandalia.	16
I	16
call	16
her	16
peerless	16
because	16
she	16
has	16
no	16
peer,	16
whether	16
it	16
be	16
in	16
bodily	16
stature	16
or	16
in	16
the	16
supremacy	16
of	16
rank	16
and	16
beauty.	16
This	16
same	16
Casildea,	16
then,	16
that	16
I	16
speak	16
of,	16
requited	16
my	16
honourable	16
passion	16
and	16
gentle	16
aspirations	16
by	16
compelling	16
me,	16
as	16
his	16
stepmother	16
did	16
Hercules,	16
to	16
engage	16
in	16
many	16
perils	16
of	16
various	16
sorts,	16
at	16
the	16
end	16
of	16
each	16
promising	16
me	16
that,	16
with	16
the	16
end	16
of	16
the	16
next,	16
the	16
object	16
of	16
my	16
hopes	16
should	16
be	16
attained;	16
but	16
my	16
labours	16
have	16
gone	16
on	16
increasing	16
link	16
by	16
link	16
until	16
they	16
are	16
past	16
counting,	16
nor	16
do	16
I	16
know	16
what	16
will	16
be	16
the	16
last	16
one	16
that	16
is	16
to	16
be	16
the	16
beginning	16
of	16
the	16
accomplishment	16
of	16
my	16
chaste	16
desires.	16
On	16
one	16
occasion	16
she	16
bade	16
me	16
go	16
and	16
challenge	16
the	16
famous	16
giantess	16
of	16
Seville,	16
La	16
Giralda	16
by	16
name,	16
who	16
is	16
as	16
mighty	16
and	16
strong	16
as	16
if	16
made	16
of	16
brass,	16
and	16
though	16
never	16
stirring	16
from	16
one	16
spot,	16
is	16
the	16
most	16
restless	16
and	16
changeable	16
woman	16
in	16
the	16
world.	16
I	16
came,	16
I	16
saw,	16
I	16
conquered,	16
and	16
I	16
made	16
her	16
stay	16
quiet	16
and	16
behave	16
herself,	16
for	16
nothing	16
but	16
north	16
winds	16
blew	16
for	16
more	16
than	16
a	16
week.	16
Another	16
time	16
I	16
was	16
ordered	16
to	16
lift	16
those	16
ancient	16
stones,	16
the	16
mighty	16
bulls	16
of	16
Guisando,	16
an	16
enterprise	16
that	16
might	16
more	16
fitly	16
be	16
entrusted	16
to	16
porters	16
than	16
to	16
knights.	16
Again,	16
she	16
bade	16
me	16
fling	16
myself	16
into	16
the	16
cavern	16
of	16
Cabra—an	16
unparalleled	16
and	16
awful	16
peril—and	16
bring	16
her	16
a	16
minute	16
account	16
of	16
all	16
that	16
is	16
concealed	16
in	16
those	16
gloomy	16
depths.	16
I	16
stopped	16
the	16
motion	16
of	16
the	16
Giralda,	16
I	16
lifted	16
the	16
bulls	16
of	16
Guisando,	16
I	16
flung	16
myself	16
into	16
the	16
cavern	16
and	16
brought	16
to	16
light	16
the	16
secrets	16
of	16
its	16
abyss;	16
and	16
my	16
hopes	16
are	16
as	16
dead	16
as	16
dead	16
can	16
be,	16
and	16
her	16
scorn	16
and	16
her	16
commands	16
as	16
lively	16
as	16
ever.	16
To	16
be	16
brief,	16
last	16
of	16
all	16
she	16
has	16
commanded	16
me	16
to	16
go	16
through	16
all	16
the	16
provinces	16
of	16
Spain	16
and	16
compel	16
all	16
the	16
knights-errant	16
wandering	16
therein	16
to	16
confess	16
that	16
she	16
surpasses	16
all	16
women	16
alive	16
to-day	16
in	16
beauty,	16
and	16
that	16
I	16
am	16
the	16
most	16
valiant	16
and	16
the	16
most	16
deeply	16
enamoured	16
knight	16
on	16
earth;	16
in	16
support	16
of	16
which	16
claim	16
I	16
have	16
already	16
travelled	16
over	16
the	16
greater	16
part	16
of	16
Spain,	16
and	16
have	16
there	16
vanquished	16
several	16
knights	16
who	16
have	16
dared	16
to	16
contradict	16
me;	16
but	16
what	16
I	16
most	16
plume	16
and	16
pride	16
myself	16
upon	16
is	16
having	16
vanquished	16
in	16
single	16
combat	16
that	16
so	16
famous	16
knight	16
Don	16
Quixote	16
of	16
La	16
Mancha,	16
and	16
made	16
him	16
confess	16
that	16
my	16
Casildea	16
is	16
more	16
beautiful	16
than	16
his	16
Dulcinea;	16
and	16
in	16
this	16
one	16
victory	16
I	16
hold	16
myself	16
to	16
have	16
conquered	16
all	16
the	16
knights	16
in	16
the	16
world;	16
for	16
this	16
Don	16
Quixote	16
that	16
I	16
speak	16
of	16
has	16
vanquished	16
them	16
all,	16
and	16
I	16
having	16
vanquished	16
him,	16
his	16
glory,	16
his	16
fame,	16
and	16
his	16
honour	16
have	16
passed	16
and	16
are	16
transferred	16
to	16
my	16
person;	16
for	16
The	16
more	16
the	16
vanquished	16
hath	16
of	16
fair	16
renown,	16
The	16
greater	16
glory	16
gilds	16
the	16
victor’s	16
crown.	16
Thus	16
the	16
innumerable	16
achievements	16
of	16
the	16
said	16
Don	16
Quixote	16
are	16
now	16
set	16
down	16
to	16
my	16
account	16
and	16
have	16
become	16
mine.”	16
Don	16
Quixote	16
was	16
amazed	16
when	16
he	16
heard	16
the	16
Knight	16
of	16
the	16
Grove,	16
and	16
was	16
a	16
thousand	16
times	16
on	16
the	16
point	16
of	16
telling	16
him	16
he	16
lied,	16
and	16
had	16
the	16
lie	16
direct	16
already	16
on	16
the	16
tip	16
of	16
his	16
tongue;	16
but	16
he	16
restrained	16
himself	16
as	16
well	16
as	16
he	16
could,	16
in	16
order	16
to	16
force	16
him	16
to	16
confess	16
the	16
lie	16
with	16
his	16
own	16
lips;	16
so	16
he	16
said	16
to	16
him	16
quietly,	16
“As	16
to	16
what	16
you	16
say,	16
sir	16
knight,	16
about	16
having	16
vanquished	16
most	16
of	16
the	16
knights	16
of	16
Spain,	16
or	16
even	16
of	16
the	16
whole	16
world,	16
I	16
say	16
nothing;	16
but	16
that	16
you	16
have	16
vanquished	16
Don	16
Quixote	16
of	16
La	16
Mancha	16
I	16
consider	16
doubtful;	16
it	16
may	16
have	16
been	16
some	16
other	16
that	16
resembled	16
him,	16
although	16
there	16
are	16
few	16
like	16
him.”	16
“How!	16
not	16
vanquished?”	16
said	16
he	16
of	16
the	16
Grove;	16
“by	16
the	16
heaven	16
that	16
is	16
above	16
us	16
I	16
fought	16
Don	16
Quixote	16
and	16
overcame	16
him	16
and	16
made	16
him	16
yield;	16
and	16
he	16
is	16
a	16
man	16
of	16
tall	16
stature,	16
gaunt	16
features,	16
long,	16
lank	16
limbs,	16
with	16
hair	16
turning	16
grey,	16
an	16
aquiline	16
nose	16
rather	16
hooked,	16
and	16
large	16
black	16
drooping	16
moustaches;	16
he	16
does	16
battle	16
under	16
the	16
name	16
of	16
‘The	16
Countenance,’	16
and	16
he	16
has	16
for	16
squire	16
a	16
peasant	16
called	16
Sancho	16
Panza;	16
he	16
presses	16
the	16
loins	16
and	16
rules	16
the	16
reins	16
of	16
a	16
famous	16
steed	16
called	16
Rocinante;	16
and	16
lastly,	16
he	16
has	16
for	16
the	16
mistress	16
of	16
his	16
will	16
a	16
certain	16
Dulcinea	16
del	16
Toboso,	16
once	16
upon	16
a	16
time	16
called	16
Aldonza	16
Lorenzo,	16
just	16
as	16
I	16
call	16
mine	16
Casildea	16
de	16
Vandalia	16
because	16
her	16
name	16
is	16
Casilda	16
and	16
she	16
is	16
of	16
Andalusia.	16
If	16
all	16
these	16
tokens	16
are	16
not	16
enough	16
to	16
vindicate	16
the	16
truth	16
of	16
what	16
I	16
say,	16
here	16
is	16
my	16
sword,	16
that	16
will	16
compel	16
incredulity	16
itself	16
to	16
give	16
credence	16
to	16
it.”	16
“Calm	16
yourself,	16
sir	16
knight,”	16
said	16
Don	16
Quixote,	16
“and	16
give	16
ear	16
to	16
what	16
I	16
am	16
about	16
to	16
say	16
to	16
you.	16
I	16
would	16
have	16
you	16
know	16
that	16
this	16
Don	16
Quixote	16
you	16
speak	16
of	16
is	16
the	16
greatest	16
friend	16
I	16
have	16
in	16
the	16
world;	16
so	16
much	16
so	16
that	16
I	16
may	16
say	16
I	16
regard	16
him	16
in	16
the	16
same	16
light	16
as	16
my	16
own	16
person;	16
and	16
from	16
the	16
precise	16
and	16
clear	16
indications	16
you	16
have	16
given	16
I	16
cannot	16
but	16
think	16
that	16
he	16
must	16
be	16
the	16
very	16
one	16
you	16
have	16
vanquished.	16
On	16
the	16
other	16
hand,	16
I	16
see	16
with	16
my	16
eyes	16
and	16
feel	16
with	16
my	16
hands	16
that	16
it	16
is	16
impossible	16
it	16
can	16
have	16
been	16
the	16
same;	16
unless	16
indeed	16
it	16
be	16
that,	16
as	16
he	16
has	16
many	16
enemies	16
who	16
are	16
enchanters,	16
and	16
one	16
in	16
particular	16
who	16
is	16
always	16
persecuting	16
him,	16
someone	16
of	16
these	16
may	16
have	16
taken	16
his	16
shape	16
in	16
order	16
to	16
allow	16
himself	16
to	16
be	16
vanquished,	16
so	16
as	16
to	16
defraud	16
him	16
of	16
the	16
fame	16
that	16
his	16
exalted	16
achievements	16
as	16
a	16
knight	16
have	16
earned	16
and	16
acquired	16
for	16
him	16
throughout	16
the	16
known	16
world.	16
And	16
in	16
confirmation	16
of	16
this,	16
I	16
must	16
tell	16
you,	16
too,	16
that	16
it	16
is	16
but	16
ten	16
hours	16
since	16
these	16
said	16
enchanters	16
his	16
enemies	16
transformed	16
the	16
shape	16
and	16
person	16
of	16
the	16
fair	16
Dulcinea	16
del	16
Toboso	16
into	16
a	16
foul	16
and	16
mean	16
village	16
lass,	16
and	16
in	16
the	16
same	16
way	16
they	16
must	16
have	16
transformed	16
Don	16
Quixote;	16
and	16
if	16
all	16
this	16
does	16
not	16
suffice	16
to	16
convince	16
you	16
of	16
the	16
truth	16
of	16
what	16
I	16
say,	16
here	16
is	16
Don	16
Quixote	16
himself,	16
who	16
will	16
maintain	16
it	16
by	16
arms,	16
on	16
foot	16
or	16
on	16
horseback	16
or	16
in	16
any	16
way	16
you	16
please.”	16
And	16
so	16
saying	16
he	16
stood	16
up	16
and	16
laid	16
his	16
hand	16
on	16
his	16
sword,	16
waiting	16
to	16
see	16
what	16
the	16
Knight	16
of	16
the	16
Grove	16
would	16
do,	16
who	16
in	16
an	16
equally	16
calm	16
voice	16
said	16
in	16
reply,	16
“Pledges	16
don’t	16
distress	16
a	16
good	16
payer;	16
he	16
who	16
has	16
succeeded	16
in	16
vanquishing	16
you	16
once	16
when	16
transformed,	16
Sir	16
Don	16
Quixote,	16
may	16
fairly	16
hope	16
to	16
subdue	16
you	16
in	16
your	16
own	16
proper	16
shape;	16
but	16
as	16
it	16
is	16
not	16
becoming	16
for	16
knights	16
to	16
perform	16
their	16
feats	16
of	16
arms	16
in	16
the	16
dark,	16
like	16
highwaymen	16
and	16
bullies,	16
let	16
us	16
wait	16
till	16
daylight,	16
that	16
the	16
sun	16
may	16
behold	16
our	16
deeds;	16
and	16
the	16
conditions	16
of	16
our	16
combat	16
shall	16
be	16
that	16
the	16
vanquished	16
shall	16
be	16
at	16
the	16
victor’s	16
disposal,	16
to	16
do	16
all	16
that	16
he	16
may	16
enjoin,	16
provided	16
the	16
injunction	16
be	16
such	16
as	16
shall	16
be	16
becoming	16
a	16
knight.”	16
“I	16
am	16
more	16
than	16
satisfied	16
with	16
these	16
conditions	16
and	16
terms,”	16
replied	16
Don	16
Quixote;	16
and	16
so	16
saying,	16
they	16
betook	16
themselves	16
to	16
where	16
their	16
squires	16
lay,	16
and	16
found	16
them	16
snoring,	16
and	16
in	16
the	16
same	16
posture	16
they	16
were	16
in	16
when	16
sleep	16
fell	16
upon	16
them.	16
They	16
roused	16
them	16
up,	16
and	16
bade	16
them	16
get	16
the	16
horses	16
ready,	16
as	16
at	16
sunrise	16
they	16
were	16
to	16
engage	16
in	16
a	16
bloody	16
and	16
arduous	16
single	16
combat;	16
at	16
which	16
intelligence	16
Sancho	16
was	16
aghast	16
and	16
thunderstruck,	16
trembling	16
for	16
the	16
safety	16
of	16
his	16
master	16
because	16
of	16
the	16
mighty	16
deeds	16
he	16
had	16
heard	16
the	16
squire	16
of	16
the	16
Grove	16
ascribe	16
to	16
his;	16
but	16
without	16
a	16
word	16
the	16
two	16
squires	16
went	16
in	16
quest	16
of	16
their	16
cattle;	16
for	16
by	16
this	16
time	16
the	16
three	16
horses	16
and	16
the	16
ass	16
had	16
smelt	16
one	16
another	16
out,	16
and	16
were	16
all	16
together.	16
On	16
the	16
way,	16
he	16
of	16
the	16
Grove	16
said	16
to	16
Sancho,	16
“You	16
must	16
know,	16
brother,	16
that	16
it	16
is	16
the	16
custom	16
with	16
the	16
fighting	16
men	16
of	16
Andalusia,	16
when	16
they	16
are	16
godfathers	16
in	16
any	16
quarrel,	16
not	16
to	16
stand	16
idle	16
with	16
folded	16
arms	16
while	16
their	16
godsons	16
fight;	16
I	16
say	16
so	16
to	16
remind	16
you	16
that	16
while	16
our	16
masters	16
are	16
fighting,	16
we,	16
too,	16
have	16
to	16
fight,	16
and	16
knock	16
one	16
another	16
to	16
shivers.”	16
“That	16
custom,	16
sir	16
squire,”	16
replied	16
Sancho,	16
“may	16
hold	16
good	16
among	16
those	16
bullies	16
and	16
fighting	16
men	16
you	16
talk	16
of,	16
but	16
certainly	16
not	16
among	16
the	16
squires	16
of	16
knights-errant;	16
at	16
least,	16
I	16
have	16
never	16
heard	16
my	16
master	16
speak	16
of	16
any	16
custom	16
of	16
the	16
sort,	16
and	16
he	16
knows	16
all	16
the	16
laws	16
of	16
knight-errantry	16
by	16
heart;	16
but	16
granting	16
it	16
true	16
that	16
there	16
is	16
an	16
express	16
law	16
that	16
squires	16
are	16
to	16
fight	16
while	16
their	16
masters	16
are	16
fighting,	16
I	16
don’t	16
mean	16
to	16
obey	16
it,	16
but	16
to	16
pay	16
the	16
penalty	16
that	16
may	16
be	16
laid	16
on	16
peacefully	16
minded	16
squires	16
like	16
myself;	16
for	16
I	16
am	16
sure	16
it	16
cannot	16
be	16
more	16
than	16
two	16
pounds	16
of	16
wax,	16
and	16
I	16
would	16
rather	16
pay	16
that,	16
for	16
I	16
know	16
it	16
will	16
cost	16
me	16
less	16
than	16
the	16
lint	16
I	16
shall	16
be	16
at	16
the	16
expense	16
of	16
to	16
mend	16
my	16
head,	16
which	16
I	16
look	16
upon	16
as	16
broken	16
and	16
split	16
already;	16
there’s	16
another	16
thing	16
that	16
makes	16
it	16
impossible	16
for	16
me	16
to	16
fight,	16
that	16
I	16
have	16
no	16
sword,	16
for	16
I	16
never	16
carried	16
one	16
in	16
my	16
life.”	16
“I	16
know	16
a	16
good	16
remedy	16
for	16
that,”	16
said	16
he	16
of	16
the	16
Grove;	16
“I	16
have	16
here	16
two	16
linen	16
bags	16
of	16
the	16
same	16
size;	16
you	16
shall	16
take	16
one,	16
and	16
I	16
the	16
other,	16
and	16
we	16
will	16
fight	16
at	16
bag	16
blows	16
with	16
equal	16
arms.”	16
“If	16
that’s	16
the	16
way,	16
so	16
be	16
it	16
with	16
all	16
my	16
heart,”	16
said	16
Sancho,	16
“for	16
that	16
sort	16
of	16
battle	16
will	16
serve	16
to	16
knock	16
the	16
dust	16
out	16
of	16
us	16
instead	16
of	16
hurting	16
us.”	16
“That	16
will	16
not	16
do,”	16
said	16
the	16
other,	16
“for	16
we	16
must	16
put	16
into	16
the	16
bags,	16
to	16
keep	16
the	16
wind	16
from	16
blowing	16
them	16
away,	16
half	16
a	16
dozen	16
nice	16
smooth	16
pebbles,	16
all	16
of	16
the	16
same	16
weight;	16
and	16
in	16
this	16
way	16
we	16
shall	16
be	16
able	16
to	16
baste	16
one	16
another	16
without	16
doing	16
ourselves	16
any	16
harm	16
or	16
mischief.”	16
“Body	16
of	16
my	16
father!”	16
said	16
Sancho,	16
“see	16
what	16
marten	16
and	16
sable,	16
and	16
pads	16
of	16
carded	16
cotton	16
he	16
is	16
putting	16
into	16
the	16
bags,	16
that	16
our	16
heads	16
may	16
not	16
be	16
broken	16
and	16
our	16
bones	16
beaten	16
to	16
jelly!	16
But	16
even	16
if	16
they	16
are	16
filled	16
with	16
toss	16
silk,	16
I	16
can	16
tell	16
you,	16
señor,	16
I	16
am	16
not	16
going	16
to	16
fight;	16
let	16
our	16
masters	16
fight,	16
that’s	16
their	16
lookout,	16
and	16
let	16
us	16
drink	16
and	16
live;	16
for	16
time	16
will	16
take	16
care	16
to	16
ease	16
us	16
of	16
our	16
lives,	16
without	16
our	16
going	16
to	16
look	16
for	16
fillips	16
so	16
that	16
they	16
may	16
be	16
finished	16
off	16
before	16
their	16
proper	16
time	16
comes	16
and	16
they	16
drop	16
from	16
ripeness.”	16
“Still,”	16
returned	16
he	16
of	16
the	16
Grove,	16
“we	16
must	16
fight,	16
if	16
it	16
be	16
only	16
for	16
half	16
an	16
hour.”	16
“By	16
no	16
means,”	16
said	16
Sancho;	16
“I	16
am	16
not	16
going	16
to	16
be	16
so	16
discourteous	16
or	16
so	16
ungrateful	16
as	16
to	16
have	16
any	16
quarrel,	16
be	16
it	16
ever	16
so	16
small,	16
with	16
one	16
I	16
have	16
eaten	16
and	16
drunk	16
with;	16
besides,	16
who	16
the	16
devil	16
could	16
bring	16
himself	16
to	16
fight	16
in	16
cold	16
blood,	16
without	16
anger	16
or	16
provocation?”	16
“I	16
can	16
remedy	16
that	16
entirely,”	16
said	16
he	16
of	16
the	16
Grove,	16
“and	16
in	16
this	16
way:	16
before	16
we	16
begin	16
the	16
battle,	16
I	16
will	16
come	16
up	16
to	16
your	16
worship	16
fair	16
and	16
softly,	16
and	16
give	16
you	16
three	16
or	16
four	16
buffets,	16
with	16
which	16
I	16
shall	16
stretch	16
you	16
at	16
my	16
feet	16
and	16
rouse	16
your	16
anger,	16
though	16
it	16
were	16
sleeping	16
sounder	16
than	16
a	16
dormouse.”	16
“To	16
match	16
that	16
plan,”	16
said	16
Sancho,	16
“I	16
have	16
another	16
that	16
is	16
not	16
a	16
whit	16
behind	16
it;	16
I	16
will	16
take	16
a	16
cudgel,	16
and	16
before	16
your	16
worship	16
comes	16
near	16
enough	16
to	16
waken	16
my	16
anger	16
I	16
will	16
send	16
yours	16
so	16
sound	16
to	16
sleep	16
with	16
whacks,	16
that	16
it	16
won’t	16
waken	16
unless	16
it	16
be	16
in	16
the	16
other	16
world,	16
where	16
it	16
is	16
known	16
that	16
I	16
am	16
not	16
a	16
man	16
to	16
let	16
my	16
face	16
be	16
handled	16
by	16
anyone;	16
let	16
each	16
look	16
out	16
for	16
the	16
arrow—though	16
the	16
surer	16
way	16
would	16
be	16
to	16
let	16
everyone’s	16
anger	16
sleep,	16
for	16
nobody	16
knows	16
the	16
heart	16
of	16
anyone,	16
and	16
a	16
man	16
may	16
come	16
for	16
wool	16
and	16
go	16
back	16
shorn;	16
God	16
gave	16
his	16
blessing	16
to	16
peace	16
and	16
his	16
curse	16
to	16
quarrels;	16
if	16
a	16
hunted	16
cat,	16
surrounded	16
and	16
hard	16
pressed,	16
turns	16
into	16
a	16
lion,	16
God	16
knows	16
what	16
I,	16
who	16
am	16
a	16
man,	16
may	16
turn	16
into;	16
and	16
so	16
from	16
this	16
time	16
forth	16
I	16
warn	16
you,	16
sir	16
squire,	16
that	16
all	16
the	16
harm	16
and	16
mischief	16
that	16
may	16
come	16
of	16
our	16
quarrel	16
will	16
be	16
put	16
down	16
to	16
your	16
account.”	16
“Very	16
good,”	16
said	16
he	16
of	16
the	16
Grove;	16
“God	16
will	16
send	16
the	16
dawn	16
and	16
we	16
shall	16
be	16
all	16
right.”	16
And	16
now	16
gay-plumaged	16
birds	16
of	16
all	16
sorts	16
began	16
to	16
warble	16
in	16
the	16
trees,	16
and	16
with	16
their	16
varied	16
and	16
gladsome	16
notes	16
seemed	16
to	16
welcome	16
and	16
salute	16
the	16
fresh	16
morn	16
that	16
was	16
beginning	16
to	16
show	16
the	16
beauty	16
of	16
her	16
countenance	16
at	16
the	16
gates	16
and	16
balconies	16
of	16
the	16
east,	16
shaking	16
from	16
her	16
locks	16
a	16
profusion	16
of	16
liquid	16
pearls;	16
in	16
which	16
dulcet	16
moisture	16
bathed,	16
the	16
plants,	16
too,	16
seemed	16
to	16
shed	16
and	16
shower	16
down	16
a	16
pearly	16
spray,	16
the	16
willows	16
distilled	16
sweet	16
manna,	16
the	16
fountains	16
laughed,	16
the	16
brooks	16
babbled,	16
the	16
woods	16
rejoiced,	16
and	16
the	16
meadows	16
arrayed	16
themselves	16
in	16
all	16
their	16
glory	16
at	16
her	16
coming.	16
But	16
hardly	16
had	16
the	16
light	16
of	16
day	16
made	16
it	16
possible	16
to	16
see	16
and	16
distinguish	16
things,	16
when	16
the	16
first	16
object	16
that	16
presented	16
itself	16
to	16
the	16
eyes	16
of	16
Sancho	16
Panza	16
was	16
the	16
squire	16
of	16
the	16
Grove’s	16
nose,	16
which	16
was	16
so	16
big	16
that	16
it	16
almost	16
overshadowed	16
his	16
whole	16
body.	16
It	16
is,	16
in	16
fact,	16
stated,	16
that	16
it	16
was	16
of	16
enormous	16
size,	16
hooked	16
in	16
the	16
middle,	16
covered	16
with	16
warts,	16
and	16
of	16
a	16
mulberry	16
colour	16
like	16
an	16
egg-plant;	16
it	16
hung	16
down	16
two	16
fingers’	16
length	16
below	16
his	16
mouth,	16
and	16
the	16
size,	16
the	16
colour,	16
the	16
warts,	16
and	16
the	16
bend	16
of	16
it,	16
made	16
his	16
face	16
so	16
hideous,	16
that	16
Sancho,	16
as	16
he	16
looked	16
at	16
him,	16
began	16
to	16
tremble	16
hand	16
and	16
foot	16
like	16
a	16
child	16
in	16
convulsions,	16
and	16
he	16
vowed	16
in	16
his	16
heart	16
to	16
let	16
himself	16
be	16
given	16
two	16
hundred	16
buffets,	16
sooner	16
than	16
be	16
provoked	16
to	16
fight	16
that	16
monster.	16
Don	16
Quixote	16
examined	16
his	16
adversary,	16
and	16
found	16
that	16
he	16
already	16
had	16
his	16
helmet	16
on	16
and	16
visor	16
lowered,	16
so	16
that	16
he	16
could	16
not	16
see	16
his	16
face;	16
he	16
observed,	16
however,	16
that	16
he	16
was	16
a	16
sturdily	16
built	16
man,	16
but	16
not	16
very	16
tall	16
in	16
stature.	16
Over	16
his	16
armour	16
he	16
wore	16
a	16
surcoat	16
or	16
cassock	16
of	16
what	16
seemed	16
to	16
be	16
the	16
finest	16
cloth	16
of	16
gold,	16
all	16
bespangled	16
with	16
glittering	16
mirrors	16
like	16
little	16
moons,	16
which	16
gave	16
him	16
an	16
extremely	16
gallant	16
and	16
splendid	16
appearance;	16
above	16
his	16
helmet	16
fluttered	16
a	16
great	16
quantity	16
of	16
plumes,	16
green,	16
yellow,	16
and	16
white,	16
and	16
his	16
lance,	16
which	16
was	16
leaning	16
against	16
a	16
tree,	16
was	16
very	16
long	16
and	16
stout,	16
and	16
had	16
a	16
steel	16
point	16
more	16
than	16
a	16
palm	16
in	16
length.	16
Don	16
Quixote	16
observed	16
all,	16
and	16
took	16
note	16
of	16
all,	16
and	16
from	16
what	16
he	16
saw	16
and	16
observed	16
he	16
concluded	16
that	16
the	16
said	16
knight	16
must	16
be	16
a	16
man	16
of	16
great	16
strength,	16
but	16
he	16
did	16
not	16
for	16
all	16
that	16
give	16
way	16
to	16
fear,	16
like	16
Sancho	16
Panza;	16
on	16
the	16
contrary,	16
with	16
a	16
composed	16
and	16
dauntless	16
air,	16
he	16
said	16
to	16
the	16
Knight	16
of	16
the	16
Mirrors,	16
“If,	16
sir	16
knight,	16
your	16
great	16
eagerness	16
to	16
fight	16
has	16
not	16
banished	16
your	16
courtesy,	16
by	16
it	16
I	16
would	16
entreat	16
you	16
to	16
raise	16
your	16
visor	16
a	16
little,	16
in	16
order	16
that	16
I	16
may	16
see	16
if	16
the	16
comeliness	16
of	16
your	16
countenance	16
corresponds	16
with	16
that	16
of	16
your	16
equipment.”	16
“Whether	16
you	16
come	16
victorious	16
or	16
vanquished	16
out	16
of	16
this	16
emprise,	16
sir	16
knight,”	16
replied	16
he	16
of	16
the	16
Mirrors,	16
“you	16
will	16
have	16
more	16
than	16
enough	16
time	16
and	16
leisure	16
to	16
see	16
me;	16
and	16
if	16
now	16
I	16
do	16
not	16
comply	16
with	16
your	16
request,	16
it	16
is	16
because	16
it	16
seems	16
to	16
me	16
I	16
should	16
do	16
a	16
serious	16
wrong	16
to	16
the	16
fair	16
Casildea	16
de	16
Vandalia	16
in	16
wasting	16
time	16
while	16
I	16
stopped	16
to	16
raise	16
my	16
visor	16
before	16
compelling	16
you	16
to	16
confess	16
what	16
you	16
are	16
already	16
aware	16
I	16
maintain.”	16
“Well	16
then,”	16
said	16
Don	16
Quixote,	16
“while	16
we	16
are	16
mounting	16
you	16
can	16
at	16
least	16
tell	16
me	16
if	16
I	16
am	16
that	16
Don	16
Quixote	16
whom	16
you	16
said	16
you	16
vanquished.”	16
“To	16
that	16
we	16
answer	16
you,”	16
said	16
he	16
of	16
the	16
Mirrors,	16
“that	16
you	16
are	16
as	16
like	16
the	16
very	16
knight	16
I	16
vanquished	16
as	16
one	16
egg	16
is	16
like	16
another,	16
but	16
as	16
you	16
say	16
enchanters	16
persecute	16
you,	16
I	16
will	16
not	16
venture	16
to	16
say	16
positively	16
whether	16
you	16
are	16
the	16
said	16
person	16
or	16
not.”	16
“That,”	16
said	16
Don	16
Quixote,	16
“is	16
enough	16
to	16
convince	16
me	16
that	16
you	16
are	16
under	16
a	16
deception;	16
however,	16
entirely	16
to	16
relieve	16
you	16
of	16
it,	16
let	16
our	16
horses	16
be	16
brought,	16
and	16
in	16
less	16
time	16
than	16
it	16
would	16
take	16
you	16
to	16
raise	16
your	16
visor,	16
if	16
God,	16
my	16
lady,	16
and	16
my	16
arm	16
stand	16
me	16
in	16
good	16
stead,	16
I	16
shall	16
see	16
your	16
face,	16
and	16
you	16
shall	16
see	16
that	16
I	16
am	16
not	16
the	16
vanquished	16
Don	16
Quixote	16
you	16
take	16
me	16
to	16
be.”	16
With	16
this,	16
cutting	16
short	16
the	16
colloquy,	16
they	16
mounted,	16
and	16
Don	16
Quixote	16
wheeled	16
Rocinante	16
round	16
in	16
order	16
to	16
take	16
a	16
proper	16
distance	16
to	16
charge	16
back	16
upon	16
his	16
adversary,	16
and	16
he	16
of	16
the	16
Mirrors	16
did	16
the	16
same;	16
but	16
Don	16
Quixote	16
had	16
not	16
moved	16
away	16
twenty	16
paces	16
when	16
he	16
heard	16
himself	16
called	16
by	16
the	16
other,	16
and,	16
each	16
returning	16
half-way,	16
he	16
of	16
the	16
Mirrors	16
said	16
to	16
him,	16
“Remember,	16
sir	16
knight,	16
that	16
the	16
terms	16
of	16
our	16
combat	16
are,	16
that	16
the	16
vanquished,	16
as	16
I	16
said	16
before,	16
shall	16
be	16
at	16
the	16
victor’s	16
disposal.”	16
“I	16
am	16
aware	16
of	16
it	16
already,”	16
said	16
Don	16
Quixote;	16
“provided	16
what	16
is	16
commanded	16
and	16
imposed	16
upon	16
the	16
vanquished	16
be	16
things	16
that	16
do	16
not	16
transgress	16
the	16
limits	16
of	16
chivalry.”	16
“That	16
is	16
understood,”	16
replied	16
he	16
of	16
the	16
Mirrors.	16
At	16
this	16
moment	16
the	16
extraordinary	16
nose	16
of	16
the	16
squire	16
presented	16
itself	16
to	16
Don	16
Quixote’s	16
view,	16
and	16
he	16
was	16
no	16
less	16
amazed	16
than	16
Sancho	16
at	16
the	16
sight;	16
insomuch	16
that	16
he	16
set	16
him	16
down	16
as	16
a	16
monster	16
of	16
some	16
kind,	16
or	16
a	16
human	16
being	16
of	16
some	16
new	16
species	16
or	16
unearthly	16
breed.	16
Sancho,	16
seeing	16
his	16
master	16
retiring	16
to	16
run	16
his	16
course,	16
did	16
not	16
like	16
to	16
be	16
left	16
alone	16
with	16
the	16
nosy	16
man,	16
fearing	16
that	16
with	16
one	16
flap	16
of	16
that	16
nose	16
on	16
his	16
own	16
the	16
battle	16
would	16
be	16
all	16
over	16
for	16
him	16
and	16
he	16
would	16
be	16
left	16
stretched	16
on	16
the	16
ground,	16
either	16
by	16
the	16
blow	16
or	16
with	16
fright;	16
so	16
he	16
ran	16
after	16
his	16
master,	16
holding	16
on	16
to	16
Rocinante’s	16
stirrup-leather,	16
and	16
when	16
it	16
seemed	16
to	16
him	16
time	16
to	16
turn	16
about,	16
he	16
said,	16
“I	16
implore	16
of	16
your	16
worship,	16
señor,	16
before	16
you	16
turn	16
to	16
charge,	16
to	16
help	16
me	16
up	16
into	16
this	16
cork	16
tree,	16
from	16
which	16
I	16
will	16
be	16
able	16
to	16
witness	16
the	16
gallant	16
encounter	16
your	16
worship	16
is	16
going	16
to	16
have	16
with	16
this	16
knight,	16
more	16
to	16
my	16
taste	16
and	16
better	16
than	16
from	16
the	16
ground.”	16
“It	16
seems	16
to	16
me	16
rather,	16
Sancho,”	16
said	16
Don	16
Quixote,	16
“that	16
thou	16
wouldst	16
mount	16
a	16
scaffold	16
in	16
order	16
to	16
see	16
the	16
bulls	16
without	16
danger.”	16
“To	16
tell	16
the	16
truth,”	16
returned	16
Sancho,	16
“the	16
monstrous	16
nose	16
of	16
that	16
squire	16
has	16
filled	16
me	16
with	16
fear	16
and	16
terror,	16
and	16
I	16
dare	16
not	16
stay	16
near	16
him.”	16
“It	16
is,”	16
said	16
Don	16
Quixote,	16
“such	16
a	16
one	16
that	16
were	16
I	16
not	16
what	16
I	16
am	16
it	16
would	16
terrify	16
me	16
too;	16
so,	16
come,	16
I	16
will	16
help	16
thee	16
up	16
where	16
thou	16
wilt.”	16
While	16
Don	16
Quixote	16
waited	16
for	16
Sancho	16
to	16
mount	16
into	16
the	16
cork	16
tree	16
he	16
of	16
the	16
Mirrors	16
took	16
as	16
much	16
ground	16
as	16
he	16
considered	16
requisite,	16
and,	16
supposing	16
Don	16
Quixote	16
to	16
have	16
done	16
the	16
same,	16
without	16
waiting	16
for	16
any	16
sound	16
of	16
trumpet	16
or	16
other	16
signal	16
to	16
direct	16
them,	16
he	16
wheeled	16
his	16
horse,	16
which	16
was	16
not	16
more	16
agile	16
or	16
better-looking	16
than	16
Rocinante,	16
and	16
at	16
his	16
top	16
speed,	16
which	16
was	16
an	16
easy	16
trot,	16
he	16
proceeded	16
to	16
charge	16
his	16
enemy;	16
seeing	16
him,	16
however,	16
engaged	16
in	16
putting	16
Sancho	16
up,	16
he	16
drew	16
rein,	16
and	16
halted	16
in	16
mid	16
career,	16
for	16
which	16
his	16
horse	16
was	16
very	16
grateful,	16
as	16
he	16
was	16
already	16
unable	16
to	16
go.	16
Don	16
Quixote,	16
fancying	16
that	16
his	16
foe	16
was	16
coming	16
down	16
upon	16
him	16
flying,	16
drove	16
his	16
spurs	16
vigorously	16
into	16
Rocinante’s	16
lean	16
flanks	16
and	16
made	16
him	16
scud	16
along	16
in	16
such	16
style	16
that	16
the	16
history	16
tells	16
us	16
that	16
on	16
this	16
occasion	16
only	16
was	16
he	16
known	16
to	16
make	16
something	16
like	16
running,	16
for	16
on	16
all	16
others	16
it	16
was	16
a	16
simple	16
trot	16
with	16
him;	16
and	16
with	16
this	16
unparalleled	16
fury	16
he	16
bore	16
down	16
where	16
he	16
of	16
the	16
Mirrors	16
stood	16
digging	16
his	16
spurs	16
into	16
his	16
horse	16
up	16
to	16
buttons,	16
without	16
being	16
able	16
to	16
make	16
him	16
stir	16
a	16
finger’s	16
length	16
from	16
the	16
spot	16
where	16
he	16
had	16
come	16
to	16
a	16
standstill	16
in	16
his	16
course.	16
At	16
this	16
lucky	16
moment	16
and	16
crisis,	16
Don	16
Quixote	16
came	16
upon	16
his	16
adversary,	16
in	16
trouble	16
with	16
his	16
horse,	16
and	16
embarrassed	16
with	16
his	16
lance,	16
which	16
he	16
either	16
could	16
not	16
manage,	16
or	16
had	16
no	16
time	16
to	16
lay	16
in	16
rest.	16
Don	16
Quixote,	16
however,	16
paid	16
no	16
attention	16
to	16
these	16
difficulties,	16
and	16
in	16
perfect	16
safety	16
to	16
himself	16
and	16
without	16
any	16
risk	16
encountered	16
him	16
of	16
the	16
Mirrors	16
with	16
such	16
force	16
that	16
he	16
brought	16
him	16
to	16
the	16
ground	16
in	16
spite	16
of	16
himself	16
over	16
the	16
haunches	16
of	16
his	16
horse,	16
and	16
with	16
so	16
heavy	16
a	16
fall	16
that	16
he	16
lay	16
to	16
all	16
appearance	16
dead,	16
not	16
stirring	16
hand	16
or	16
foot.	16
The	16
instant	16
Sancho	16
saw	16
him	16
fall	16
he	16
slid	16
down	16
from	16
the	16
cork	16
tree,	16
and	16
made	16
all	16
haste	16
to	16
where	16
his	16
master	16
was,	16
who,	16
dismounting	16
from	16
Rocinante,	16
went	16
and	16
stood	16
over	16
him	16
of	16
the	16
Mirrors,	16
and	16
unlacing	16
his	16
helmet	16
to	16
see	16
if	16
he	16
was	16
dead,	16
and	16
to	16
give	16
him	16
air	16
if	16
he	16
should	16
happen	16
to	16
be	16
alive,	16
he	16
saw—who	16
can	16
say	16
what	16
he	16
saw,	16
without	16
filling	16
all	16
who	16
hear	16
it	16
with	16
astonishment,	16
wonder,	16
and	16
awe?	16
He	16
saw,	16
the	16
history	16
says,	16
the	16
very	16
countenance,	16
the	16
very	16
face,	16
the	16
very	16
look,	16
the	16
very	16
physiognomy,	16
the	16
very	16
effigy,	16
the	16
very	16
image	16
of	16
the	16
bachelor	16
Samson	16
Carrasco!	16
As	16
soon	16
as	16
he	16
saw	16
it	16
he	16
called	16
out	16
in	16
a	16
loud	16
voice,	16
“Make	16
haste	16
here,	16
Sancho,	16
and	16
behold	16
what	16
thou	16
art	16
to	16
see	16
but	16
not	16
to	16
believe;	16
quick,	16
my	16
son,	16
and	16
learn	16
what	16
magic	16
can	16
do,	16
and	16
wizards	16
and	16
enchanters	16
are	16
capable	16
of.”	16
Sancho	16
came	16
up,	16
and	16
when	16
he	16
saw	16
the	16
countenance	16
of	16
the	16
bachelor	16
Carrasco,	16
he	16
fell	16
to	16
crossing	16
himself	16
a	16
thousand	16
times,	16
and	16
blessing	16
himself	16
as	16
many	16
more.	16
All	16
this	16
time	16
the	16
prostrate	16
knight	16
showed	16
no	16
signs	16
of	16
life,	16
and	16
Sancho	16
said	16
to	16
Don	16
Quixote,	16
“It	16
is	16
my	16
opinion,	16
señor,	16
that	16
in	16
any	16
case	16
your	16
worship	16
should	16
take	16
and	16
thrust	16
your	16
sword	16
into	16
the	16
mouth	16
of	16
this	16
one	16
here	16
that	16
looks	16
like	16
the	16
bachelor	16
Samson	16
Carrasco;	16
perhaps	16
in	16
him	16
you	16
will	16
kill	16
one	16
of	16
your	16
enemies,	16
the	16
enchanters.”	16
“Thy	16
advice	16
is	16
not	16
bad,”	16
said	16
Don	16
Quixote,	16
“for	16
of	16
enemies	16
the	16
fewer	16
the	16
better;”	16
and	16
he	16
was	16
drawing	16
his	16
sword	16
to	16
carry	16
into	16
effect	16
Sancho’s	16
counsel	16
and	16
suggestion,	16
when	16
the	16
squire	16
of	16
the	16
Mirrors	16
came	16
up,	16
now	16
without	16
the	16
nose	16
which	16
had	16
made	16
him	16
so	16
hideous,	16
and	16
cried	16
out	16
in	16
a	16
loud	16
voice,	16
“Mind	16
what	16
you	16
are	16
about,	16
Señor	16
Don	16
Quixote;	16
that	16
is	16
your	16
friend,	16
the	16
bachelor	16
Samson	16
Carrasco,	16
you	16
have	16
at	16
your	16
feet,	16
and	16
I	16
am	16
his	16
squire.”	16
“And	16
the	16
nose?”	16
said	16
Sancho,	16
seeing	16
him	16
without	16
the	16
hideous	16
feature	16
he	16
had	16
before;	16
to	16
which	16
he	16
replied,	16
“I	16
have	16
it	16
here	16
in	16
my	16
pocket,”	16
and	16
putting	16
his	16
hand	16
into	16
his	16
right	16
pocket,	16
he	16
pulled	16
out	16
a	16
masquerade	16
nose	16
of	16
varnished	16
pasteboard	16
of	16
the	16
make	16
already	16
described;	16
and	16
Sancho,	16
examining	16
him	16
more	16
and	16
more	16
closely,	16
exclaimed	16
aloud	16
in	16
a	16
voice	16
of	16
amazement,	16
“Holy	16
Mary	16
be	16
good	16
to	16
me!	16
Isn’t	16
it	16
Tom	16
Cecial,	16
my	16
neighbour	16
and	16
gossip?”	16
“Why,	16
to	16
be	16
sure	16
I	16
am!”	16
returned	16
the	16
now	16
unnosed	16
squire;	16
“Tom	16
Cecial	16
I	16
am,	16
gossip	16
and	16
friend	16
Sancho	16
Panza;	16
and	16
I’ll	16
tell	16
you	16
presently	16
the	16
means	16
and	16
tricks	16
and	16
falsehoods	16
by	16
which	16
I	16
have	16
been	16
brought	16
here;	16
but	16
in	16
the	16
meantime,	16
beg	16
and	16
entreat	16
of	16
your	16
master	16
not	16
to	16
touch,	16
maltreat,	16
wound,	16
or	16
slay	16
the	16
Knight	16
of	16
the	16
Mirrors	16
whom	16
he	16
has	16
at	16
his	16
feet;	16
because,	16
beyond	16
all	16
dispute,	16
it	16
is	16
the	16
rash	16
and	16
ill-advised	16
bachelor	16
Samson	16
Carrasco,	16
our	16
fellow	16
townsman.”	16
At	16
this	16
moment	16
he	16
of	16
the	16
Mirrors	16
came	16
to	16
himself,	16
and	16
Don	16
Quixote	16
perceiving	16
it,	16
held	16
the	16
naked	16
point	16
of	16
his	16
sword	16
over	16
his	16
face,	16
and	16
said	16
to	16
him,	16
“You	16
are	16
a	16
dead	16
man,	16
knight,	16
unless	16
you	16
confess	16
that	16
the	16
peerless	16
Dulcinea	16
del	16
Toboso	16
excels	16
your	16
Casildea	16
de	16
Vandalia	16
in	16
beauty;	16
and	16
in	16
addition	16
to	16
this	16
you	16
must	16
promise,	16
if	16
you	16
should	16
survive	16
this	16
encounter	16
and	16
fall,	16
to	16
go	16
to	16
the	16
city	16
of	16
El	16
Toboso	16
and	16
present	16
yourself	16
before	16
her	16
on	16
my	16
behalf,	16
that	16
she	16
deal	16
with	16
you	16
according	16
to	16
her	16
good	16
pleasure;	16
and	16
if	16
she	16
leaves	16
you	16
free	16
to	16
do	16
yours,	16
you	16
are	16
in	16
like	16
manner	16
to	16
return	16
and	16
seek	16
me	16
out	16
(for	16
the	16
trail	16
of	16
my	16
mighty	16
deeds	16
will	16
serve	16
you	16
as	16
a	16
guide	16
to	16
lead	16
you	16
to	16
where	16
I	16
may	16
be),	16
and	16
tell	16
me	16
what	16
may	16
have	16
passed	16
between	16
you	16
and	16
her—conditions	16
which,	16
in	16
accordance	16
with	16
what	16
we	16
stipulated	16
before	16
our	16
combat,	16
do	16
not	16
transgress	16
the	16
just	16
limits	16
of	16
knight-errantry.”	16
“I	16
confess,”	16
said	16
the	16
fallen	16
knight,	16
“that	16
the	16
dirty	16
tattered	16
shoe	16
of	16
the	16
lady	16
Dulcinea	16
del	16
Toboso	16
is	16
better	16
than	16
the	16
ill-combed	16
though	16
clean	16
beard	16
of	16
Casildea;	16
and	16
I	16
promise	16
to	16
go	16
and	16
to	16
return	16
from	16
her	16
presence	16
to	16
yours,	16
and	16
to	16
give	16
you	16
a	16
full	16
and	16
particular	16
account	16
of	16
all	16
you	16
demand	16
of	16
me.”	16
“You	16
must	16
also	16
confess	16
and	16
believe,”	16
added	16
Don	16
Quixote,	16
“that	16
the	16
knight	16
you	16
vanquished	16
was	16
not	16
and	16
could	16
not	16
be	16
Don	16
Quixote	16
of	16
La	16
Mancha,	16
but	16
someone	16
else	16
in	16
his	16
likeness,	16
just	16
as	16
I	16
confess	16
and	16
believe	16
that	16
you,	16
though	16
you	16
seem	16
to	16
be	16
the	16
bachelor	16
Samson	16
Carrasco,	16
are	16
not	16
so,	16
but	16
some	16
other	16
resembling	16
him,	16
whom	16
my	16
enemies	16
have	16
here	16
put	16
before	16
me	16
in	16
his	16
shape,	16
in	16
order	16
that	16
I	16
may	16
restrain	16
and	16
moderate	16
the	16
vehemence	16
of	16
my	16
wrath,	16
and	16
make	16
a	16
gentle	16
use	16
of	16
the	16
glory	16
of	16
my	16
victory.”	16
“I	16
confess,	16
hold,	16
and	16
think	16
everything	16
to	16
be	16
as	16
you	16
believe,	16
hold,	16
and	16
think	16
it,”	16
the	16
crippled	16
knight;	16
“let	16
me	16
rise,	16
I	16
entreat	16
you;	16
if,	16
indeed,	16
the	16
shock	16
of	16
my	16
fall	16
will	16
allow	16
me,	16
for	16
it	16
has	16
left	16
me	16
in	16
a	16
sorry	16
plight	16
enough.”	16
Don	16
Quixote	16
helped	16
him	16
to	16
rise,	16
with	16
the	16
assistance	16
of	16
his	16
squire	16
Tom	16
Cecial;	16
from	16
whom	16
Sancho	16
never	16
took	16
his	16
eyes,	16
and	16
to	16
whom	16
he	16
put	16
questions,	16
the	16
replies	16
to	16
which	16
furnished	16
clear	16
proof	16
that	16
he	16
was	16
really	16
and	16
truly	16
the	16
Tom	16
Cecial	16
he	16
said;	16
but	16
the	16
impression	16
made	16
on	16
Sancho’s	16
mind	16
by	16
what	16
his	16
master	16
said	16
about	16
the	16
enchanters	16
having	16
changed	16
the	16
face	16
of	16
the	16
Knight	16
of	16
the	16
Mirrors	16
into	16
that	16
of	16
the	16
bachelor	16
Samson	16
Carrasco,	16
would	16
not	16
permit	16
him	16
to	16
believe	16
what	16
he	16
saw	16
with	16
his	16
eyes.	16
In	16
fine,	16
both	16
master	16
and	16
man	16
remained	16
under	16
the	16
delusion;	16
and,	16
down	16
in	16
the	16
mouth,	16
and	16
out	16
of	16
luck,	16
he	16
of	16
the	16
Mirrors	16
and	16
his	16
squire	16
parted	16
from	16
Don	16
Quixote	16
and	16
Sancho,	16
he	16
meaning	16
to	16
go	16
look	16
for	16
some	16
village	16
where	16
he	16
could	16
plaster	16
and	16
strap	16
his	16
ribs.	16
Don	16
Quixote	16
and	16
Sancho	16
resumed	16
their	16
journey	16
to	16
Saragossa,	16
and	16
on	16
it	16
the	16
history	16
leaves	16
them	16
in	16
order	16
that	16
it	16
may	16
tell	16
who	16
the	16
Knight	16
of	16
the	16
Mirrors	16
and	16
his	16
long-nosed	16
squire	16
were.	16

Don	16
Quixote	16
went	16
off	16
satisfied,	16
elated,	16
and	16
vain-glorious	16
in	16
the	16
highest	16
degree	16
at	16
having	16
won	16
a	16
victory	16
over	16
such	16
a	16
valiant	16
knight	16
as	16
he	16
fancied	16
him	16
of	16
the	16
Mirrors	16
to	16
be,	16
and	16
one	16
from	16
whose	16
knightly	16
word	16
he	16
expected	16
to	16
learn	16
whether	16
the	16
enchantment	16
of	16
his	16
lady	16
still	16
continued;	16
inasmuch	16
as	16
the	16
said	16
vanquished	16
knight	16
was	16
bound,	16
under	16
the	16
penalty	16
of	16
ceasing	16
to	16
be	16
one,	16
to	16
return	16
and	16
render	16
him	16
an	16
account	16
of	16
what	16
took	16
place	16
between	16
him	16
and	16
her.	16
But	16
Don	16
Quixote	16
was	16
of	16
one	16
mind,	16
he	16
of	16
the	16
Mirrors	16
of	16
another,	16
for	16
he	16
just	16
then	16
had	16
no	16
thought	16
of	16
anything	16
but	16
finding	16
some	16
village	16
where	16
he	16
could	16
plaster	16
himself,	16
as	16
has	16
been	16
said	16
already.	16
The	16
history	16
goes	16
on	16
to	16
say,	16
then,	16
that	16
when	16
the	16
bachelor	16
Samson	16
Carrasco	16
recommended	16
Don	16
Quixote	16
to	16
resume	16
his	16
knight-errantry	16
which	16
he	16
had	16
laid	16
aside,	16
it	16
was	16
in	16
consequence	16
of	16
having	16
been	16
previously	16
in	16
conclave	16
with	16
the	16
curate	16
and	16
the	16
barber	16
on	16
the	16
means	16
to	16
be	16
adopted	16
to	16
induce	16
Don	16
Quixote	16
to	16
stay	16
at	16
home	16
in	16
peace	16
and	16
quiet	16
without	16
worrying	16
himself	16
with	16
his	16
ill-starred	16
adventures;	16
at	16
which	16
consultation	16
it	16
was	16
decided	16
by	16
the	16
unanimous	16
vote	16
of	16
all,	16
and	16
on	16
the	16
special	16
advice	16
of	16
Carrasco,	16
that	16
Don	16
Quixote	16
should	16
be	16
allowed	16
to	16
go,	16
as	16
it	16
seemed	16
impossible	16
to	16
restrain	16
him,	16
and	16
that	16
Samson	16
should	16
sally	16
forth	16
to	16
meet	16
him	16
as	16
a	16
knight-errant,	16
and	16
do	16
battle	16
with	16
him,	16
for	16
there	16
would	16
be	16
no	16
difficulty	16
about	16
a	16
cause,	16
and	16
vanquish	16
him,	16
that	16
being	16
looked	16
upon	16
as	16
an	16
easy	16
matter;	16
and	16
that	16
it	16
should	16
be	16
agreed	16
and	16
settled	16
that	16
the	16
vanquished	16
was	16
to	16
be	16
at	16
the	16
mercy	16
of	16
the	16
victor.	16
Then,	16
Don	16
Quixote	16
being	16
vanquished,	16
the	16
bachelor	16
knight	16
was	16
to	16
command	16
him	16
to	16
return	16
to	16
his	16
village	16
and	16
his	16
house,	16
and	16
not	16
quit	16
it	16
for	16
two	16
years,	16
or	16
until	16
he	16
received	16
further	16
orders	16
from	16
him;	16
all	16
which	16
it	16
was	16
clear	16
Don	16
Quixote	16
would	16
unhesitatingly	16
obey,	16
rather	16
than	16
contravene	16
or	16
fail	16
to	16
observe	16
the	16
laws	16
of	16
chivalry;	16
and	16
during	16
the	16
period	16
of	16
his	16
seclusion	16
he	16
might	16
perhaps	16
forget	16
his	16
folly,	16
or	16
there	16
might	16
be	16
an	16
opportunity	16
of	16
discovering	16
some	16
ready	16
remedy	16
for	16
his	16
madness.	16
Carrasco	16
undertook	16
the	16
task,	16
and	16
Tom	16
Cecial,	16
a	16
gossip	16
and	16
neighbour	16
of	16
Sancho	16
Panza’s,	16
a	16
lively,	16
feather-headed	16
fellow,	16
offered	16
himself	16
as	16
his	16
squire.	16
Carrasco	16
armed	16
himself	16
in	16
the	16
fashion	16
described,	16
and	16
Tom	16
Cecial,	16
that	16
he	16
might	16
not	16
be	16
known	16
by	16
his	16
gossip	16
when	16
they	16
met,	16
fitted	16
on	16
over	16
his	16
own	16
natural	16
nose	16
the	16
false	16
masquerade	16
one	16
that	16
has	16
been	16
mentioned;	16
and	16
so	16
they	16
followed	16
the	16
same	16
route	16
Don	16
Quixote	16
took,	16
and	16
almost	16
came	16
up	16
with	16
him	16
in	16
time	16
to	16
be	16
present	16
at	16
the	16
adventure	16
of	16
the	16
cart	16
of	16
Death	16
and	16
finally	16
encountered	16
them	16
in	16
the	16
grove,	16
where	16
all	16
that	16
the	16
sagacious	16
reader	16
has	16
been	16
reading	16
about	16
took	16
place;	16
and	16
had	16
it	16
not	16
been	16
for	16
the	16
extraordinary	16
fancies	16
of	16
Don	16
Quixote,	16
and	16
his	16
conviction	16
that	16
the	16
bachelor	16
was	16
not	16
the	16
bachelor,	16
señor	16
bachelor	16
would	16
have	16
been	16
incapacitated	16
for	16
ever	16
from	16
taking	16
his	16
degree	16
of	16
licentiate,	16
all	16
through	16
not	16
finding	16
nests	16
where	16
he	16
thought	16
to	16
find	16
birds.	16
Tom	16
Cecial,	16
seeing	16
how	16
ill	16
they	16
had	16
succeeded,	16
and	16
what	16
a	16
sorry	16
end	16
their	16
expedition	16
had	16
come	16
to,	16
said	16
to	16
the	16
bachelor,	16
“Sure	16
enough,	16
Señor	16
Samson	16
Carrasco,	16
we	16
are	16
served	16
right;	16
it	16
is	16
easy	16
enough	16
to	16
plan	16
and	16
set	16
about	16
an	16
enterprise,	16
but	16
it	16
is	16
often	16
a	16
difficult	16
matter	16
to	16
come	16
well	16
out	16
of	16
it.	16
Don	16
Quixote	16
a	16
madman,	16
and	16
we	16
sane;	16
he	16
goes	16
off	16
laughing,	16
safe,	16
and	16
sound,	16
and	16
you	16
are	16
left	16
sore	16
and	16
sorry!	16
I’d	16
like	16
to	16
know	16
now	16
which	16
is	16
the	16
madder,	16
he	16
who	16
is	16
so	16
because	16
he	16
cannot	16
help	16
it,	16
or	16
he	16
who	16
is	16
so	16
of	16
his	16
own	16
choice?”	16
To	16
which	16
Samson	16
replied,	16
“The	16
difference	16
between	16
the	16
two	16
sorts	16
of	16
madmen	16
is,	16
that	16
he	16
who	16
is	16
so	16
will	16
he	16
nil	16
he,	16
will	16
be	16
one	16
always,	16
while	16
he	16
who	16
is	16
so	16
of	16
his	16
own	16
accord	16
can	16
leave	16
off	16
being	16
one	16
whenever	16
he	16
likes.”	16
“In	16
that	16
case,”	16
said	16
Tom	16
Cecial,	16
“I	16
was	16
a	16
madman	16
of	16
my	16
own	16
accord	16
when	16
I	16
volunteered	16
to	16
become	16
your	16
squire,	16
and,	16
of	16
my	16
own	16
accord,	16
I’ll	16
leave	16
off	16
being	16
one	16
and	16
go	16
home.”	16
“That’s	16
your	16
affair,”	16
returned	16
Samson,	16
“but	16
to	16
suppose	16
that	16
I	16
am	16
going	16
home	16
until	16
I	16
have	16
given	16
Don	16
Quixote	16
a	16
thrashing	16
is	16
absurd;	16
and	16
it	16
is	16
not	16
any	16
wish	16
that	16
he	16
may	16
recover	16
his	16
senses	16
that	16
will	16
make	16
me	16
hunt	16
him	16
out	16
now,	16
but	16
a	16
wish	16
for	16
the	16
sore	16
pain	16
I	16
am	16
in	16
with	16
my	16
ribs	16
won’t	16
let	16
me	16
entertain	16
more	16
charitable	16
thoughts.”	16
Thus	16
discoursing,	16
the	16
pair	16
proceeded	16
until	16
they	16
reached	16
a	16
town	16
where	16
it	16
was	16
their	16
good	16
luck	16
to	16
find	16
a	16
bone-setter,	16
with	16
whose	16
help	16
the	16
unfortunate	16
Samson	16
was	16
cured.	16
Tom	16
Cecial	16
left	16
him	16
and	16
went	16
home,	16
while	16
he	16
stayed	16
behind	16
meditating	16
vengeance;	16
and	16
the	16
history	16
will	16
return	16
to	16
him	16
again	16
at	16
the	16
proper	16
time,	16
so	16
as	16
not	16
to	16
omit	16
making	16
merry	16
with	16
Don	16
Quixote	16
now.	16

Full	16
Size	16
Don	16
Quixote	16
pursued	16
his	16
journey	16
in	16
the	16
high	16
spirits,	16
satisfaction,	16
and	16
self-complacency	16
already	16
described,	16
fancying	16
himself	16
the	16
most	16
valorous	16
knight-errant	16
of	16
the	16
age	16
in	16
the	16
world	16
because	16
of	16
his	16
late	16
victory.	16
All	16
the	16
adventures	16
that	16
could	16
befall	16
him	16
from	16
that	16
time	16
forth	16
he	16
regarded	16
as	16
already	16
done	16
and	16
brought	16
to	16
a	16
happy	16
issue;	16
he	16
made	16
light	16
of	16
enchantments	16
and	16
enchanters;	16
he	16
thought	16
no	16
more	16
of	16
the	16
countless	16
drubbings	16
that	16
had	16
been	16
administered	16
to	16
him	16
in	16
the	16
course	16
of	16
his	16
knight-errantry,	16
nor	16
of	16
the	16
volley	16
of	16
stones	16
that	16
had	16
levelled	16
half	16
his	16
teeth,	16
nor	16
of	16
the	16
ingratitude	16
of	16
the	16
galley	16
slaves,	16
nor	16
of	16
the	16
audacity	16
of	16
the	16
Yanguesans	16
and	16
the	16
shower	16
of	16
stakes	16
that	16
fell	16
upon	16
him;	16
in	16
short,	16
he	16
said	16
to	16
himself	16
that	16
could	16
he	16
discover	16
any	16
means,	16
mode,	16
or	16
way	16
of	16
disenchanting	16
his	16
lady	16
Dulcinea,	16
he	16
would	16
not	16
envy	16
the	16
highest	16
fortune	16
that	16
the	16
most	16
fortunate	16
knight-errant	16
of	16
yore	16
ever	16
reached	16
or	16
could	16
reach.	16
He	16
was	16
going	16
along	16
entirely	16
absorbed	16
in	16
these	16
fancies,	16
when	16
Sancho	16
said	16
to	16
him,	16
“Isn’t	16
it	16
odd,	16
señor,	16
that	16
I	16
have	16
still	16
before	16
my	16
eyes	16
that	16
monstrous	16
enormous	16
nose	16
of	16
my	16
gossip,	16
Tom	16
Cecial?”	16
“And	16
dost	16
thou,	16
then,	16
believe,	16
Sancho,”	16
said	16
Don	16
Quixote,	16
“that	16
the	16
Knight	16
of	16
the	16
Mirrors	16
was	16
the	16
bachelor	16
Carrasco,	16
and	16
his	16
squire	16
Tom	16
Cecial	16
thy	16
gossip?”	16
“I	16
don’t	16
know	16
what	16
to	16
say	16
to	16
that,”	16
replied	16
Sancho;	16
“all	16
I	16
know	16
is	16
that	16
the	16
tokens	16
he	16
gave	16
me	16
about	16
my	16
own	16
house,	16
wife	16
and	16
children,	16
nobody	16
else	16
but	16
himself	16
could	16
have	16
given	16
me;	16
and	16
the	16
face,	16
once	16
the	16
nose	16
was	16
off,	16
was	16
the	16
very	16
face	16
of	16
Tom	16
Cecial,	16
as	16
I	16
have	16
seen	16
it	16
many	16
a	16
time	16
in	16
my	16
town	16
and	16
next	16
door	16
to	16
my	16
own	16
house;	16
and	16
the	16
sound	16
of	16
the	16
voice	16
was	16
just	16
the	16
same.”	16
“Let	16
us	16
reason	16
the	16
matter,	16
Sancho,”	16
said	16
Don	16
Quixote.	16
“Come	16
now,	16
by	16
what	16
process	16
of	16
thinking	16
can	16
it	16
be	16
supposed	16
that	16
the	16
bachelor	16
Samson	16
Carrasco	16
would	16
come	16
as	16
a	16
knight-errant,	16
in	16
arms	16
offensive	16
and	16
defensive,	16
to	16
fight	16
with	16
me?	16
Have	16
I	16
ever	16
been	16
by	16
any	16
chance	16
his	16
enemy?	16
Have	16
I	16
ever	16
given	16
him	16
any	16
occasion	16
to	16
owe	16
me	16
a	16
grudge?	16
Am	16
I	16
his	16
rival,	16
or	16
does	16
he	16
profess	16
arms,	16
that	16
he	16
should	16
envy	16
the	16
fame	16
I	16
have	16
acquired	16
in	16
them?”	16
“Well,	16
but	16
what	16
are	16
we	16
to	16
say,	16
señor,”	16
returned	16
Sancho,	16
“about	16
that	16
knight,	16
whoever	16
he	16
is,	16
being	16
so	16
like	16
the	16
bachelor	16
Carrasco,	16
and	16
his	16
squire	16
so	16
like	16
my	16
gossip,	16
Tom	16
Cecial?	16
And	16
if	16
that	16
be	16
enchantment,	16
as	16
your	16
worship	16
says,	16
was	16
there	16
no	16
other	16
pair	16
in	16
the	16
world	16
for	16
them	16
to	16
take	16
the	16
likeness	16
of?”	16
“It	16
is	16
all,”	16
said	16
Don	16
Quixote,	16
“a	16
scheme	16
and	16
plot	16
of	16
the	16
malignant	16
magicians	16
that	16
persecute	16
me,	16
who,	16
foreseeing	16
that	16
I	16
was	16
to	16
be	16
victorious	16
in	16
the	16
conflict,	16
arranged	16
that	16
the	16
vanquished	16
knight	16
should	16
display	16
the	16
countenance	16
of	16
my	16
friend	16
the	16
bachelor,	16
in	16
order	16
that	16
the	16
friendship	16
I	16
bear	16
him	16
should	16
interpose	16
to	16
stay	16
the	16
edge	16
of	16
my	16
sword	16
and	16
might	16
of	16
my	16
arm,	16
and	16
temper	16
the	16
just	16
wrath	16
of	16
my	16
heart;	16
so	16
that	16
he	16
who	16
sought	16
to	16
take	16
my	16
life	16
by	16
fraud	16
and	16
falsehood	16
should	16
save	16
his	16
own.	16
And	16
to	16
prove	16
it,	16
thou	16
knowest	16
already,	16
Sancho,	16
by	16
experience	16
which	16
cannot	16
lie	16
or	16
deceive,	16
how	16
easy	16
it	16
is	16
for	16
enchanters	16
to	16
change	16
one	16
countenance	16
into	16
another,	16
turning	16
fair	16
into	16
foul,	16
and	16
foul	16
into	16
fair;	16
for	16
it	16
is	16
not	16
two	16
days	16
since	16
thou	16
sawest	16
with	16
thine	16
own	16
eyes	16
the	16
beauty	16
and	16
elegance	16
of	16
the	16
peerless	16
Dulcinea	16
in	16
all	16
its	16
perfection	16
and	16
natural	16
harmony,	16
while	16
I	16
saw	16
her	16
in	16
the	16
repulsive	16
and	16
mean	16
form	16
of	16
a	16
coarse	16
country	16
wench,	16
with	16
cataracts	16
in	16
her	16
eyes	16
and	16
a	16
foul	16
smell	16
in	16
her	16
mouth;	16
and	16
when	16
the	16
perverse	16
enchanter	16
ventured	16
to	16
effect	16
so	16
wicked	16
a	16
transformation,	16
it	16
is	16
no	16
wonder	16
if	16
he	16
effected	16
that	16
of	16
Samson	16
Carrasco	16
and	16
thy	16
gossip	16
in	16
order	16
to	16
snatch	16
the	16
glory	16
of	16
victory	16
out	16
of	16
my	16
grasp.	16
For	16
all	16
that,	16
however,	16
I	16
console	16
myself,	16
because,	16
after	16
all,	16
in	16
whatever	16
shape	16
he	16
may	16
have	16
been,	16
I	16
have	16
been	16
victorious	16
over	16
my	16
enemy.”	16
“God	16
knows	16
what’s	16
the	16
truth	16
of	16
it	16
all,”	16
said	16
Sancho;	16
and	16
knowing	16
as	16
he	16
did	16
that	16
the	16
transformation	16
of	16
Dulcinea	16
had	16
been	16
a	16
device	16
and	16
imposition	16
of	16
his	16
own,	16
his	16
master’s	16
illusions	16
were	16
not	16
satisfactory	16
to	16
him;	16
but	16
he	16
did	16
not	16
like	16
to	16
reply	16
lest	16
he	16
should	16
say	16
something	16
that	16
might	16
disclose	16
his	16
trickery.	16
As	16
they	16
were	16
engaged	16
in	16
this	16
conversation	16
they	16
were	16
overtaken	16
by	16
a	16
man	16
who	16
was	16
following	16
the	16
same	16
road	16
behind	16
them,	16
mounted	16
on	16
a	16
very	16
handsome	16
flea-bitten	16
mare,	16
and	16
dressed	16
in	16
a	16
gaban	16
of	16
fine	16
green	16
cloth,	16
with	16
tawny	16
velvet	16
facings,	16
and	16
a	16
montera	16
of	16
the	16
same	16
velvet.	16
The	16
trappings	16
of	16
the	16
mare	16
were	16
of	16
the	16
field	16
and	16
jineta	16
fashion,	16
and	16
of	16
mulberry	16
colour	16
and	16
green.	16
He	16
carried	16
a	16
Moorish	16
cutlass	16
hanging	16
from	16
a	16
broad	16
green	16
and	16
gold	16
baldric;	16
the	16
buskins	16
were	16
of	16
the	16
same	16
make	16
as	16
the	16
baldric;	16
the	16
spurs	16
were	16
not	16
gilt,	16
but	16
lacquered	16
green,	16
and	16
so	16
brightly	16
polished	16
that,	16
matching	16
as	16
they	16
did	16
the	16
rest	16
of	16
his	16
apparel,	16
they	16
looked	16
better	16
than	16
if	16
they	16
had	16
been	16
of	16
pure	16
gold.	16
When	16
the	16
traveller	16
came	16
up	16
with	16
them	16
he	16
saluted	16
them	16
courteously,	16
and	16
spurring	16
his	16
mare	16
was	16
passing	16
them	16
without	16
stopping,	16
but	16
Don	16
Quixote	16
called	16
out	16
to	16
him,	16
“Gallant	16
sir,	16
if	16
so	16
be	16
your	16
worship	16
is	16
going	16
our	16
road,	16
and	16
has	16
no	16
occasion	16
for	16
speed,	16
it	16
would	16
be	16
a	16
pleasure	16
to	16
me	16
if	16
we	16
were	16
to	16
join	16
company.”	16
“In	16
truth,”	16
replied	16
he	16
on	16
the	16
mare,	16
“I	16
would	16
not	16
pass	16
you	16
so	16
hastily	16
but	16
for	16
fear	16
that	16
horse	16
might	16
turn	16
restive	16
in	16
the	16
company	16
of	16
my	16
mare.”	16
“You	16
may	16
safely	16
hold	16
in	16
your	16
mare,	16
señor,”	16
said	16
Sancho	16
in	16
reply	16
to	16
this,	16
“for	16
our	16
horse	16
is	16
the	16
most	16
virtuous	16
and	16
well-behaved	16
horse	16
in	16
the	16
world;	16
he	16
never	16
does	16
anything	16
wrong	16
on	16
such	16
occasions,	16
and	16
the	16
only	16
time	16
he	16
misbehaved,	16
my	16
master	16
and	16
I	16
suffered	16
for	16
it	16
sevenfold;	16
I	16
say	16
again	16
your	16
worship	16
may	16
pull	16
up	16
if	16
you	16
like;	16
for	16
if	16
she	16
was	16
offered	16
to	16
him	16
between	16
two	16
plates	16
the	16
horse	16
would	16
not	16
hanker	16
after	16
her.”	16
The	16
traveller	16
drew	16
rein,	16
amazed	16
at	16
the	16
trim	16
and	16
features	16
of	16
Don	16
Quixote,	16
who	16
rode	16
without	16
his	16
helmet,	16
which	16
Sancho	16
carried	16
like	16
a	16
valise	16
in	16
front	16
of	16
Dapple’s	16
pack-saddle;	16
and	16
if	16
the	16
man	16
in	16
green	16
examined	16
Don	16
Quixote	16
closely,	16
still	16
more	16
closely	16
did	16
Don	16
Quixote	16
examine	16
the	16
man	16
in	16
green,	16
who	16
struck	16
him	16
as	16
being	16
a	16
man	16
of	16
intelligence.	16
In	16
appearance	16
he	16
was	16
about	16
fifty	16
years	16
of	16
age,	16
with	16
but	16
few	16
grey	16
hairs,	16
an	16
aquiline	16
cast	16
of	16
features,	16
and	16
an	16
expression	16
between	16
grave	16
and	16
gay;	16
and	16
his	16
dress	16
and	16
accoutrements	16
showed	16
him	16
to	16
be	16
a	16
man	16
of	16
good	16
condition.	16
What	16
he	16
in	16
green	16
thought	16
of	16
Don	16
Quixote	16
of	16
La	16
Mancha	16
was	16
that	16
a	16
man	16
of	16
that	16
sort	16
and	16
shape	16
he	16
had	16
never	16
yet	16
seen;	16
he	16
marvelled	16
at	16
the	16
length	16
of	16
his	16
hair,	16
his	16
lofty	16
stature,	16
the	16
lankness	16
and	16
sallowness	16
of	16
his	16
countenance,	16
his	16
armour,	16
his	16
bearing	16
and	16
his	16
gravity—a	16
figure	16
and	16
picture	16
such	16
as	16
had	16
not	16
been	16
seen	16
in	16
those	16
regions	16
for	16
many	16
a	16
long	16
day.	16
Don	16
Quixote	16
saw	16
very	16
plainly	16
the	16
attention	16
with	16
which	16
the	16
traveller	16
was	16
regarding	16
him,	16
and	16
read	16
his	16
curiosity	16
in	16
his	16
astonishment;	16
and	16
courteous	16
as	16
he	16
was	16
and	16
ready	16
to	16
please	16
everybody,	16
before	16
the	16
other	16
could	16
ask	16
him	16
any	16
question	16
he	16
anticipated	16
him	16
by	16
saying,	16
“The	16
appearance	16
I	16
present	16
to	16
your	16
worship	16
being	16
so	16
strange	16
and	16
so	16
out	16
of	16
the	16
common,	16
I	16
should	16
not	16
be	16
surprised	16
if	16
it	16
filled	16
you	16
with	16
wonder;	16
but	16
you	16
will	16
cease	16
to	16
wonder	16
when	16
I	16
tell	16
you,	16
as	16
I	16
do,	16
that	16
I	16
am	16
one	16
of	16
those	16
knights	16
who,	16
as	16
people	16
say,	16
go	16
seeking	16
adventures.	16
I	16
have	16
left	16
my	16
home,	16
I	16
have	16
mortgaged	16
my	16
estate,	16
I	16
have	16
given	16
up	16
my	16
comforts,	16
and	16
committed	16
myself	16
to	16
the	16
arms	16
of	16
Fortune,	16
to	16
bear	16
me	16
whithersoever	16
she	16
may	16
please.	16
My	16
desire	16
was	16
to	16
bring	16
to	16
life	16
again	16
knight-errantry,	16
now	16
dead,	16
and	16
for	16
some	16
time	16
past,	16
stumbling	16
here,	16
falling	16
there,	16
now	16
coming	16
down	16
headlong,	16
now	16
raising	16
myself	16
up	16
again,	16
I	16
have	16
carried	16
out	16
a	16
great	16
portion	16
of	16
my	16
design,	16
succouring	16
widows,	16
protecting	16
maidens,	16
and	16
giving	16
aid	16
to	16
wives,	16
orphans,	16
and	16
minors,	16
the	16
proper	16
and	16
natural	16
duty	16
of	16
knights-errant;	16
and,	16
therefore,	16
because	16
of	16
my	16
many	16
valiant	16
and	16
Christian	16
achievements,	16
I	16
have	16
been	16
already	16
found	16
worthy	16
to	16
make	16
my	16
way	16
in	16
print	16
to	16
well-nigh	16
all,	16
or	16
most,	16
of	16
the	16
nations	16
of	16
the	16
earth.	16
Thirty	16
thousand	16
volumes	16
of	16
my	16
history	16
have	16
been	16
printed,	16
and	16
it	16
is	16
on	16
the	16
high-road	16
to	16
be	16
printed	16
thirty	16
thousand	16
thousands	16
of	16
times,	16
if	16
heaven	16
does	16
not	16
put	16
a	16
stop	16
to	16
it.	16
In	16
short,	16
to	16
sum	16
up	16
all	16
in	16
a	16
few	16
words,	16
or	16
in	16
a	16
single	16
one,	16
I	16
may	16
tell	16
you	16
I	16
am	16
Don	16
Quixote	16
of	16
La	16
Mancha,	16
otherwise	16
called	16
‘The	16
Knight	16
of	16
the	16
Rueful	16
Countenance;’	16
for	16
though	16
self-praise	16
is	16
degrading,	16
I	16
must	16
perforce	16
sound	16
my	16
own	16
sometimes,	16
that	16
is	16
to	16
say,	16
when	16
there	16
is	16
no	16
one	16
at	16
hand	16
to	16
do	16
it	16
for	16
me.	16
So	16
that,	16
gentle	16
sir,	16
neither	16
this	16
horse,	16
nor	16
this	16
lance,	16
nor	16
this	16
shield,	16
nor	16
this	16
squire,	16
nor	16
all	16
these	16
arms	16
put	16
together,	16
nor	16
the	16
sallowness	16
of	16
my	16
countenance,	16
nor	16
my	16
gaunt	16
leanness,	16
will	16
henceforth	16
astonish	16
you,	16
now	16
that	16
you	16
know	16
who	16
I	16
am	16
and	16
what	16
profession	16
I	16
follow.”	16
With	16
these	16
words	16
Don	16
Quixote	16
held	16
his	16
peace,	16
and,	16
from	16
the	16
time	16
he	16
took	16
to	16
answer,	16
the	16
man	16
in	16
green	16
seemed	16
to	16
be	16
at	16
a	16
loss	16
for	16
a	16
reply;	16
after	16
a	16
long	16
pause,	16
however,	16
he	16
said	16
to	16
him,	16
“You	16
were	16
right	16
when	16
you	16
saw	16
curiosity	16
in	16
my	16
amazement,	16
sir	16
knight;	16
but	16
you	16
have	16
not	16
succeeded	16
in	16
removing	16
the	16
astonishment	16
I	16
feel	16
at	16
seeing	16
you;	16
for	16
although	16
you	16
say,	16
señor,	16
that	16
knowing	16
who	16
you	16
are	16
ought	16
to	16
remove	16
it,	16
it	16
has	16
not	16
done	16
so;	16
on	16
the	16
contrary,	16
now	16
that	16
I	16
know,	16
I	16
am	16
left	16
more	16
amazed	16
and	16
astonished	16
than	16
before.	16
What!	16
is	16
it	16
possible	16
that	16
there	16
are	16
knights-errant	16
in	16
the	16
world	16
in	16
these	16
days,	16
and	16
histories	16
of	16
real	16
chivalry	16
printed?	16
I	16
cannot	16
realise	16
the	16
fact	16
that	16
there	16
can	16
be	16
anyone	16
on	16
earth	16
now-a-days	16
who	16
aids	16
widows,	16
or	16
protects	16
maidens,	16
or	16
defends	16
wives,	16
or	16
succours	16
orphans;	16
nor	16
should	16
I	16
believe	16
it	16
had	16
I	16
not	16
seen	16
it	16
in	16
your	16
worship	16
with	16
my	16
own	16
eyes.	16
Blessed	16
be	16
heaven!	16
for	16
by	16
means	16
of	16
this	16
history	16
of	16
your	16
noble	16
and	16
genuine	16
chivalrous	16
deeds,	16
which	16
you	16
say	16
has	16
been	16
printed,	16
the	16
countless	16
stories	16
of	16
fictitious	16
knights-errant	16
with	16
which	16
the	16
world	16
is	16
filled,	16
so	16
much	16
to	16
the	16
injury	16
of	16
morality	16
and	16
the	16
prejudice	16
and	16
discredit	16
of	16
good	16
histories,	16
will	16
have	16
been	16
driven	16
into	16
oblivion.”	16
“There	16
is	16
a	16
good	16
deal	16
to	16
be	16
said	16
on	16
that	16
point,”	16
said	16
Don	16
Quixote,	16
“as	16
to	16
whether	16
the	16
histories	16
of	16
the	16
knights-errant	16
are	16
fiction	16
or	16
not.”	16
“Why,	16
is	16
there	16
anyone	16
who	16
doubts	16
that	16
those	16
histories	16
are	16
false?”	16
said	16
the	16
man	16
in	16
green.	16
“I	16
doubt	16
it,”	16
said	16
Don	16
Quixote,	16
“but	16
never	16
mind	16
that	16
just	16
now;	16
if	16
our	16
journey	16
lasts	16
long	16
enough,	16
I	16
trust	16
in	16
God	16
I	16
shall	16
show	16
your	16
worship	16
that	16
you	16
do	16
wrong	16
in	16
going	16
with	16
the	16
stream	16
of	16
those	16
who	16
regard	16
it	16
as	16
a	16
matter	16
of	16
certainty	16
that	16
they	16
are	16
not	16
true.”	16
From	16
this	16
last	16
observation	16
of	16
Don	16
Quixote’s,	16
the	16
traveller	16
began	16
to	16
have	16
a	16
suspicion	16
that	16
he	16
was	16
some	16
crazy	16
being,	16
and	16
was	16
waiting	16
for	16
him	16
to	16
confirm	16
it	16
by	16
something	16
further;	16
but	16
before	16
they	16
could	16
turn	16
to	16
any	16
new	16
subject	16
Don	16
Quixote	16
begged	16
him	16
to	16
tell	16
him	16
who	16
he	16
was,	16
since	16
he	16
himself	16
had	16
rendered	16
account	16
of	16
his	16
station	16
and	16
life.	16
To	16
this,	16
he	16
in	16
the	16
green	16
gaban	16
replied	16
“I,	16
Sir	16
Knight	16
of	16
the	16
Rueful	16
Countenance,	16
am	16
a	16
gentleman	16
by	16
birth,	16
native	16
of	16
the	16
village	16
where,	16
please	16
God,	16
we	16
are	16
going	16
to	16
dine	16
to-day;	16
I	16
am	16
more	16
than	16
fairly	16
well	16
off,	16
and	16
my	16
name	16
is	16
Don	16
Diego	16
de	16
Miranda.	16
I	16
pass	16
my	16
life	16
with	16
my	16
wife,	16
children,	16
and	16
friends;	16
my	16
pursuits	16
are	16
hunting	16
and	16
fishing,	16
but	16
I	16
keep	16
neither	16
hawks	16
nor	16
greyhounds,	16
nothing	16
but	16
a	16
tame	16
partridge	16
or	16
a	16
bold	16
ferret	16
or	16
two;	16
I	16
have	16
six	16
dozen	16
or	16
so	16
of	16
books,	16
some	16
in	16
our	16
mother	16
tongue,	16
some	16
Latin,	16
some	16
of	16
them	16
history,	16
others	16
devotional;	16
those	16
of	16
chivalry	16
have	16
not	16
as	16
yet	16
crossed	16
the	16
threshold	16
of	16
my	16
door;	16
I	16
am	16
more	16
given	16
to	16
turning	16
over	16
the	16
profane	16
than	16
the	16
devotional,	16
so	16
long	16
as	16
they	16
are	16
books	16
of	16
honest	16
entertainment	16
that	16
charm	16
by	16
their	16
style	16
and	16
attract	16
and	16
interest	16
by	16
the	16
invention	16
they	16
display,	16
though	16
of	16
these	16
there	16
are	16
very	16
few	16
in	16
Spain.	16
Sometimes	16
I	16
dine	16
with	16
my	16
neighbours	16
and	16
friends,	16
and	16
often	16
invite	16
them;	16
my	16
entertainments	16
are	16
neat	16
and	16
well	16
served	16
without	16
stint	16
of	16
anything.	16
I	16
have	16
no	16
taste	16
for	16
tattle,	16
nor	16
do	16
I	16
allow	16
tattling	16
in	16
my	16
presence;	16
I	16
pry	16
not	16
into	16
my	16
neighbours’	16
lives,	16
nor	16
have	16
I	16
lynx-eyes	16
for	16
what	16
others	16
do.	16
I	16
hear	16
mass	16
every	16
day;	16
I	16
share	16
my	16
substance	16
with	16
the	16
poor,	16
making	16
no	16
display	16
of	16
good	16
works,	16
lest	16
I	16
let	16
hypocrisy	16
and	16
vainglory,	16
those	16
enemies	16
that	16
subtly	16
take	16
possession	16
of	16
the	16
most	16
watchful	16
heart,	16
find	16
an	16
entrance	16
into	16
mine.	16
I	16
strive	16
to	16
make	16
peace	16
between	16
those	16
whom	16
I	16
know	16
to	16
be	16
at	16
variance;	16
I	16
am	16
the	16
devoted	16
servant	16
of	16
Our	16
Lady,	16
and	16
my	16
trust	16
is	16
ever	16
in	16
the	16
infinite	16
mercy	16
of	16
God	16
our	16
Lord.”	16
Sancho	16
listened	16
with	16
the	16
greatest	16
attention	16
to	16
the	16
account	16
of	16
the	16
gentleman’s	16
life	16
and	16
occupation;	16
and	16
thinking	16
it	16
a	16
good	16
and	16
a	16
holy	16
life,	16
and	16
that	16
he	16
who	16
led	16
it	16
ought	16
to	16
work	16
miracles,	16
he	16
threw	16
himself	16
off	16
Dapple,	16
and	16
running	16
in	16
haste	16
seized	16
his	16
right	16
stirrup	16
and	16
kissed	16
his	16
foot	16
again	16
and	16
again	16
with	16
a	16
devout	16
heart	16
and	16
almost	16
with	16
tears.	16
Seeing	16
this	16
the	16
gentleman	16
asked	16
him,	16
“What	16
are	16
you	16
about,	16
brother?	16
What	16
are	16
these	16
kisses	16
for?”	16
“Let	16
me	16
kiss,”	16
said	16
Sancho,	16
“for	16
I	16
think	16
your	16
worship	16
is	16
the	16
first	16
saint	16
in	16
the	16
saddle	16
I	16
ever	16
saw	16
all	16
the	16
days	16
of	16
my	16
life.”	16
“I	16
am	16
no	16
saint,”	16
replied	16
the	16
gentleman,	16
“but	16
a	16
great	16
sinner;	16
but	16
you	16
are,	16
brother,	16
for	16
you	16
must	16
be	16
a	16
good	16
fellow,	16
as	16
your	16
simplicity	16
shows.”	16
Sancho	16
went	16
back	16
and	16
regained	16
his	16
pack-saddle,	16
having	16
extracted	16
a	16
laugh	16
from	16
his	16
master’s	16
profound	16
melancholy,	16
and	16
excited	16
fresh	16
amazement	16
in	16
Don	16
Diego.	16
Don	16
Quixote	16
then	16
asked	16
him	16
how	16
many	16
children	16
he	16
had,	16
and	16
observed	16
that	16
one	16
of	16
the	16
things	16
wherein	16
the	16
ancient	16
philosophers,	16
who	16
were	16
without	16
the	16
true	16
knowledge	16
of	16
God,	16
placed	16
the	16
_summum	16
bonum_	16
was	16
in	16
the	16
gifts	16
of	16
nature,	16
in	16
those	16
of	16
fortune,	16
in	16
having	16
many	16
friends,	16
and	16
many	16
and	16
good	16
children.	16
“I,	16
Señor	16
Don	16
Quixote,”	16
answered	16
the	16
gentleman,	16
“have	16
one	16
son,	16
without	16
whom,	16
perhaps,	16
I	16
should	16
count	16
myself	16
happier	16
than	16
I	16
am,	16
not	16
because	16
he	16
is	16
a	16
bad	16
son,	16
but	16
because	16
he	16
is	16
not	16
so	16
good	16
as	16
I	16
could	16
wish.	16
He	16
is	16
eighteen	16
years	16
of	16
age;	16
he	16
has	16
been	16
for	16
six	16
at	16
Salamanca	16
studying	16
Latin	16
and	16
Greek,	16
and	16
when	16
I	16
wished	16
him	16
to	16
turn	16
to	16
the	16
study	16
of	16
other	16
sciences	16
I	16
found	16
him	16
so	16
wrapped	16
up	16
in	16
that	16
of	16
poetry	16
(if	16
that	16
can	16
be	16
called	16
a	16
science)	16
that	16
there	16
is	16
no	16
getting	16
him	16
to	16
take	16
kindly	16
to	16
the	16
law,	16
which	16
I	16
wished	16
him	16
to	16
study,	16
or	16
to	16
theology,	16
the	16
queen	16
of	16
them	16
all.	16
I	16
would	16
like	16
him	16
to	16
be	16
an	16
honour	16
to	16
his	16
family,	16
as	16
we	16
live	16
in	16
days	16
when	16
our	16
kings	16
liberally	16
reward	16
learning	16
that	16
is	16
virtuous	16
and	16
worthy;	16
for	16
learning	16
without	16
virtue	16
is	16
a	16
pearl	16
on	16
a	16
dunghill.	16
He	16
spends	16
the	16
whole	16
day	16
in	16
settling	16
whether	16
Homer	16
expressed	16
himself	16
correctly	16
or	16
not	16
in	16
such	16
and	16
such	16
a	16
line	16
of	16
the	16
Iliad,	16
whether	16
Martial	16
was	16
indecent	16
or	16
not	16
in	16
such	16
and	16
such	16
an	16
epigram,	16
whether	16
such	16
and	16
such	16
lines	16
of	16
Virgil	16
are	16
to	16
be	16
understood	16
in	16
this	16
way	16
or	16
in	16
that;	16
in	16
short,	16
all	16
his	16
talk	16
is	16
of	16
the	16
works	16
of	16
these	16
poets,	16
and	16
those	16
of	16
Horace,	16
Perseus,	16
Juvenal,	16
and	16
Tibullus;	16
for	16
of	16
the	16
moderns	16
in	16
our	16
own	16
language	16
he	16
makes	16
no	16
great	16
account;	16
but	16
with	16
all	16
his	16
seeming	16
indifference	16
to	16
Spanish	16
poetry,	16
just	16
now	16
his	16
thoughts	16
are	16
absorbed	16
in	16
making	16
a	16
gloss	16
on	16
four	16
lines	16
that	16
have	16
been	16
sent	16
him	16
from	16
Salamanca,	16
which	16
I	16
suspect	16
are	16
for	16
some	16
poetical	16
tournament.”	16
To	16
all	16
this	16
Don	16
Quixote	16
said	16
in	16
reply,	16
“Children,	16
señor,	16
are	16
portions	16
of	16
their	16
parents’	16
bowels,	16
and	16
therefore,	16
be	16
they	16
good	16
or	16
bad,	16
are	16
to	16
be	16
loved	16
as	16
we	16
love	16
the	16
souls	16
that	16
give	16
us	16
life;	16
it	16
is	16
for	16
the	16
parents	16
to	16
guide	16
them	16
from	16
infancy	16
in	16
the	16
ways	16
of	16
virtue,	16
propriety,	16
and	16
worthy	16
Christian	16
conduct,	16
so	16
that	16
when	16
grown	16
up	16
they	16
may	16
be	16
the	16
staff	16
of	16
their	16
parents’	16
old	16
age,	16
and	16
the	16
glory	16
of	16
their	16
posterity;	16
and	16
to	16
force	16
them	16
to	16
study	16
this	16
or	16
that	16
science	16
I	16
do	16
not	16
think	16
wise,	16
though	16
it	16
may	16
be	16
no	16
harm	16
to	16
persuade	16
them;	16
and	16
when	16
there	16
is	16
no	16
need	16
to	16
study	16
for	16
the	16
sake	16
of	16
_pane	16
lucrando_,	16
and	16
it	16
is	16
the	16
student’s	16
good	16
fortune	16
that	16
heaven	16
has	16
given	16
him	16
parents	16
who	16
provide	16
him	16
with	16
it,	16
it	16
would	16
be	16
my	16
advice	16
to	16
them	16
to	16
let	16
him	16
pursue	16
whatever	16
science	16
they	16
may	16
see	16
him	16
most	16
inclined	16
to;	16
and	16
though	16
that	16
of	16
poetry	16
is	16
less	16
useful	16
than	16
pleasurable,	16
it	16
is	16
not	16
one	16
of	16
those	16
that	16
bring	16
discredit	16
upon	16
the	16
possessor.	16
Poetry,	16
gentle	16
sir,	16
is,	16
as	16
I	16
take	16
it,	16
like	16
a	16
tender	16
young	16
maiden	16
of	16
supreme	16
beauty,	16
to	16
array,	16
bedeck,	16
and	16
adorn	16
whom	16
is	16
the	16
task	16
of	16
several	16
other	16
maidens,	16
who	16
are	16
all	16
the	16
rest	16
of	16
the	16
sciences;	16
and	16
she	16
must	16
avail	16
herself	16
of	16
the	16
help	16
of	16
all,	16
and	16
all	16
derive	16
their	16
lustre	16
from	16
her.	16
But	16
this	16
maiden	16
will	16
not	16
bear	16
to	16
be	16
handled,	16
nor	16
dragged	16
through	16
the	16
streets,	16
nor	16
exposed	16
either	16
at	16
the	16
corners	16
of	16
the	16
market-places,	16
or	16
in	16
the	16
closets	16
of	16
palaces.	16
She	16
is	16
the	16
product	16
of	16
an	16
Alchemy	16
of	16
such	16
virtue	16
that	16
he	16
who	16
is	16
able	16
to	16
practise	16
it,	16
will	16
turn	16
her	16
into	16
pure	16
gold	16
of	16
inestimable	16
worth.	16
He	16
that	16
possesses	16
her	16
must	16
keep	16
her	16
within	16
bounds,	16
not	16
permitting	16
her	16
to	16
break	16
out	16
in	16
ribald	16
satires	16
or	16
soulless	16
sonnets.	16
She	16
must	16
on	16
no	16
account	16
be	16
offered	16
for	16
sale,	16
unless,	16
indeed,	16
it	16
be	16
in	16
heroic	16
poems,	16
moving	16
tragedies,	16
or	16
sprightly	16
and	16
ingenious	16
comedies.	16
She	16
must	16
not	16
be	16
touched	16
by	16
the	16
buffoons,	16
nor	16
by	16
the	16
ignorant	16
vulgar,	16
incapable	16
of	16
comprehending	16
or	16
appreciating	16
her	16
hidden	16
treasures.	16
And	16
do	16
not	16
suppose,	16
señor,	16
that	16
I	16
apply	16
the	16
term	16
vulgar	16
here	16
merely	16
to	16
plebeians	16
and	16
the	16
lower	16
orders;	16
for	16
everyone	16
who	16
is	16
ignorant,	16
be	16
he	16
lord	16
or	16
prince,	16
may	16
and	16
should	16
be	16
included	16
among	16
the	16
vulgar.	16
He,	16
then,	16
who	16
shall	16
embrace	16
and	16
cultivate	16
poetry	16
under	16
the	16
conditions	16
I	16
have	16
named,	16
shall	16
become	16
famous,	16
and	16
his	16
name	16
honoured	16
throughout	16
all	16
the	16
civilised	16
nations	16
of	16
the	16
earth.	16
And	16
with	16
regard	16
to	16
what	16
you	16
say,	16
señor,	16
of	16
your	16
son	16
having	16
no	16
great	16
opinion	16
of	16
Spanish	16
poetry,	16
I	16
am	16
inclined	16
to	16
think	16
that	16
he	16
is	16
not	16
quite	16
right	16
there,	16
and	16
for	16
this	16
reason:	16
the	16
great	16
poet	16
Homer	16
did	16
not	16
write	16
in	16
Latin,	16
because	16
he	16
was	16
a	16
Greek,	16
nor	16
did	16
Virgil	16
write	16
in	16
Greek,	16
because	16
he	16
was	16
a	16
Latin;	16
in	16
short,	16
all	16
the	16
ancient	16
poets	16
wrote	16
in	16
the	16
language	16
they	16
imbibed	16
with	16
their	16
mother’s	16
milk,	16
and	16
never	16
went	16
in	16
quest	16
of	16
foreign	16
ones	16
to	16
express	16
their	16
sublime	16
conceptions;	16
and	16
that	16
being	16
so,	16
the	16
usage	16
should	16
in	16
justice	16
extend	16
to	16
all	16
nations,	16
and	16
the	16
German	16
poet	16
should	16
not	16
be	16
undervalued	16
because	16
he	16
writes	16
in	16
his	16
own	16
language,	16
nor	16
the	16
Castilian,	16
nor	16
even	16
the	16
Biscayan,	16
for	16
writing	16
in	16
his.	16
But	16
your	16
son,	16
señor,	16
I	16
suspect,	16
is	16
not	16
prejudiced	16
against	16
Spanish	16
poetry,	16
but	16
against	16
those	16
poets	16
who	16
are	16
mere	16
Spanish	16
verse	16
writers,	16
without	16
any	16
knowledge	16
of	16
other	16
languages	16
or	16
sciences	16
to	16
adorn	16
and	16
give	16
life	16
and	16
vigour	16
to	16
their	16
natural	16
inspiration;	16
and	16
yet	16
even	16
in	16
this	16
he	16
may	16
be	16
wrong;	16
for,	16
according	16
to	16
a	16
true	16
belief,	16
a	16
poet	16
is	16
born	16
one;	16
that	16
is	16
to	16
say,	16
the	16
poet	16
by	16
nature	16
comes	16
forth	16
a	16
poet	16
from	16
his	16
mother’s	16
womb;	16
and	16
following	16
the	16
bent	16
that	16
heaven	16
has	16
bestowed	16
upon	16
him,	16
without	16
the	16
aid	16
of	16
study	16
or	16
art,	16
he	16
produces	16
things	16
that	16
show	16
how	16
truly	16
he	16
spoke	16
who	16
said,	16
‘_Est	16
Deus	16
in	16
nobis_,’	16
etc.	16
At	16
the	16
same	16
time,	16
I	16
say	16
that	16
the	16
poet	16
by	16
nature	16
who	16
calls	16
in	16
art	16
to	16
his	16
aid	16
will	16
be	16
a	16
far	16
better	16
poet,	16
and	16
will	16
surpass	16
him	16
who	16
tries	16
to	16
be	16
one	16
relying	16
upon	16
his	16
knowledge	16
of	16
art	16
alone.	16
The	16
reason	16
is,	16
that	16
art	16
does	16
not	16
surpass	16
nature,	16
but	16
only	16
brings	16
it	16
to	16
perfection;	16
and	16
thus,	16
nature	16
combined	16
with	16
art,	16
and	16
art	16
with	16
nature,	16
will	16
produce	16
a	16
perfect	16
poet.	16
To	16
bring	16
my	16
argument	16
to	16
a	16
close,	16
I	16
would	16
say	16
then,	16
gentle	16
sir,	16
let	16
your	16
son	16
go	16
on	16
as	16
his	16
star	16
leads	16
him,	16
for	16
being	16
so	16
studious	16
as	16
he	16
seems	16
to	16
be,	16
and	16
having	16
already	16
successfully	16
surmounted	16
the	16
first	16
step	16
of	16
the	16
sciences,	16
which	16
is	16
that	16
of	16
the	16
languages,	16
with	16
their	16
help	16
he	16
will	16
by	16
his	16
own	16
exertions	16
reach	16
the	16
summit	16
of	16
polite	16
literature,	16
which	16
so	16
well	16
becomes	16
an	16
independent	16
gentleman,	16
and	16
adorns,	16
honours,	16
and	16
distinguishes	16
him,	16
as	16
much	16
as	16
the	16
mitre	16
does	16
the	16
bishop,	16
or	16
the	16
gown	16
the	16
learned	16
counsellor.	16
If	16
your	16
son	16
write	16
satires	16
reflecting	16
on	16
the	16
honour	16
of	16
others,	16
chide	16
and	16
correct	16
him,	16
and	16
tear	16
them	16
up;	16
but	16
if	16
he	16
compose	16
discourses	16
in	16
which	16
he	16
rebukes	16
vice	16
in	16
general,	16
in	16
the	16
style	16
of	16
Horace,	16
and	16
with	16
elegance	16
like	16
his,	16
commend	16
him;	16
for	16
it	16
is	16
legitimate	16
for	16
a	16
poet	16
to	16
write	16
against	16
envy	16
and	16
lash	16
the	16
envious	16
in	16
his	16
verse,	16
and	16
the	16
other	16
vices	16
too,	16
provided	16
he	16
does	16
not	16
single	16
out	16
individuals;	16
there	16
are,	16
however,	16
poets	16
who,	16
for	16
the	16
sake	16
of	16
saying	16
something	16
spiteful,	16
would	16
run	16
the	16
risk	16
of	16
being	16
banished	16
to	16
the	16
coast	16
of	16
Pontus.	16
If	16
the	16
poet	16
be	16
pure	16
in	16
his	16
morals,	16
he	16
will	16
be	16
pure	16
in	16
his	16
verses	16
too;	16
the	16
pen	16
is	16
the	16
tongue	16
of	16
the	16
mind,	16
and	16
as	16
the	16
thought	16
engendered	16
there,	16
so	16
will	16
be	16
the	16
things	16
that	16
it	16
writes	16
down.	16
And	16
when	16
kings	16
and	16
princes	16
observe	16
this	16
marvellous	16
science	16
of	16
poetry	16
in	16
wise,	16
virtuous,	16
and	16
thoughtful	16
subjects,	16
they	16
honour,	16
value,	16
exalt	16
them,	16
and	16
even	16
crown	16
them	16
with	16
the	16
leaves	16
of	16
that	16
tree	16
which	16
the	16
thunderbolt	16
strikes	16
not,	16
as	16
if	16
to	16
show	16
that	16
they	16
whose	16
brows	16
are	16
honoured	16
and	16
adorned	16
with	16
such	16
a	16
crown	16
are	16
not	16
to	16
be	16
assailed	16
by	16
anyone.”	16
He	16
of	16
the	16
green	16
gaban	16
was	16
filled	16
with	16
astonishment	16
at	16
Don	16
Quixote’s	16
argument,	16
so	16
much	16
so	16
that	16
he	16
began	16
to	16
abandon	16
the	16
notion	16
he	16
had	16
taken	16
up	16
about	16
his	16
being	16
crazy.	16
But	16
in	16
the	16
middle	16
of	16
the	16
discourse,	16
it	16
being	16
not	16
very	16
much	16
to	16
his	16
taste,	16
Sancho	16
had	16
turned	16
aside	16
out	16
of	16
the	16
road	16
to	16
beg	16
a	16
little	16
milk	16
from	16
some	16
shepherds,	16
who	16
were	16
milking	16
their	16
ewes	16
hard	16
by;	16
and	16
just	16
as	16
the	16
gentleman,	16
highly	16
pleased,	16
was	16
about	16
to	16
renew	16
the	16
conversation,	16
Don	16
Quixote,	16
raising	16
his	16
head,	16
perceived	16
a	16
cart	16
covered	16
with	16
royal	16
flags	16
coming	16
along	16
the	16
road	16
they	16
were	16
travelling;	16
and	16
persuaded	16
that	16
this	16
must	16
be	16
some	16
new	16
adventure,	16
he	16
called	16
aloud	16
to	16
Sancho	16
to	16
come	16
and	16
bring	16
him	16
his	16
helmet.	16
Sancho,	16
hearing	16
himself	16
called,	16
quitted	16
the	16
shepherds,	16
and,	16
prodding	16
Dapple	16
vigorously,	16
came	16
up	16
to	16
his	16
master,	16
to	16
whom	16
there	16
fell	16
a	16
terrific	16
and	16
desperate	16
adventure.	16

The	16
history	16
tells	16
that	16
when	16
Don	16
Quixote	16
called	16
out	16
to	16
Sancho	16
to	16
bring	16
him	16
his	16
helmet,	16
Sancho	16
was	16
buying	16
some	16
curds	16
the	16
shepherds	16
agreed	16
to	16
sell	16
him,	16
and	16
flurried	16
by	16
the	16
great	16
haste	16
his	16
master	16
was	16
in	16
did	16
not	16
know	16
what	16
to	16
do	16
with	16
them	16
or	16
what	16
to	16
carry	16
them	16
in;	16
so,	16
not	16
to	16
lose	16
them,	16
for	16
he	16
had	16
already	16
paid	16
for	16
them,	16
he	16
thought	16
it	16
best	16
to	16
throw	16
them	16
into	16
his	16
master’s	16
helmet,	16
and	16
acting	16
on	16
this	16
bright	16
idea	16
he	16
went	16
to	16
see	16
what	16
his	16
master	16
wanted	16
with	16
him.	16
He,	16
as	16
he	16
approached,	16
exclaimed	16
to	16
him:	16
“Give	16
me	16
that	16
helmet,	16
my	16
friend,	16
for	16
either	16
I	16
know	16
little	16
of	16
adventures,	16
or	16
what	16
I	16
observe	16
yonder	16
is	16
one	16
that	16
will,	16
and	16
does,	16
call	16
upon	16
me	16
to	16
arm	16
myself.”	16
He	16
of	16
the	16
green	16
gaban,	16
on	16
hearing	16
this,	16
looked	16
in	16
all	16
directions,	16
but	16
could	16
perceive	16
nothing,	16
except	16
a	16
cart	16
coming	16
towards	16
them	16
with	16
two	16
or	16
three	16
small	16
flags,	16
which	16
led	16
him	16
to	16
conclude	16
it	16
must	16
be	16
carrying	16
treasure	16
of	16
the	16
King’s,	16
and	16
he	16
said	16
so	16
to	16
Don	16
Quixote.	16
He,	16
however,	16
would	16
not	16
believe	16
him,	16
being	16
always	16
persuaded	16
and	16
convinced	16
that	16
all	16
that	16
happened	16
to	16
him	16
must	16
be	16
adventures	16
and	16
still	16
more	16
adventures;	16
so	16
he	16
replied	16
to	16
the	16
gentleman,	16
“He	16
who	16
is	16
prepared	16
has	16
his	16
battle	16
half	16
fought;	16
nothing	16
is	16
lost	16
by	16
my	16
preparing	16
myself,	16
for	16
I	16
know	16
by	16
experience	16
that	16
I	16
have	16
enemies,	16
visible	16
and	16
invisible,	16
and	16
I	16
know	16
not	16
when,	16
or	16
where,	16
or	16
at	16
what	16
moment,	16
or	16
in	16
what	16
shapes	16
they	16
will	16
attack	16
me;”	16
and	16
turning	16
to	16
Sancho,	16
he	16
called	16
for	16
his	16
helmet;	16
and	16
Sancho,	16
as	16
he	16
had	16
no	16
time	16
to	16
take	16
out	16
the	16
curds,	16
had	16
to	16
give	16
it	16
just	16
as	16
it	16
was.	16
Don	16
Quixote	16
took	16
it,	16
and	16
without	16
perceiving	16
what	16
was	16
in	16
it	16
thrust	16
it	16
down	16
in	16
hot	16
haste	16
upon	16
his	16
head;	16
but	16
as	16
the	16
curds	16
were	16
pressed	16
and	16
squeezed	16
the	16
whey	16
began	16
to	16
run	16
all	16
over	16
his	16
face	16
and	16
beard,	16
whereat	16
he	16
was	16
so	16
startled	16
that	16
he	16
cried	16
out	16
to	16
Sancho:	16
“Sancho,	16
what’s	16
this?	16
I	16
think	16
my	16
head	16
is	16
softening,	16
or	16
my	16
brains	16
are	16
melting,	16
or	16
I	16
am	16
sweating	16
from	16
head	16
to	16
foot!	16
If	16
I	16
am	16
sweating	16
it	16
is	16
not	16
indeed	16
from	16
fear.	16
I	16
am	16
convinced	16
beyond	16
a	16
doubt	16
that	16
the	16
adventure	16
which	16
is	16
about	16
to	16
befall	16
me	16
is	16
a	16
terrible	16
one.	16
Give	16
me	16
something	16
to	16
wipe	16
myself	16
with,	16
if	16
thou	16
hast	16
it,	16
for	16
this	16
profuse	16
sweat	16
is	16
blinding	16
me.”	16
Sancho	16
held	16
his	16
tongue,	16
and	16
gave	16
him	16
a	16
cloth,	16
and	16
gave	16
thanks	16
to	16
God	16
at	16
the	16
same	16
time	16
that	16
his	16
master	16
had	16
not	16
found	16
out	16
what	16
was	16
the	16
matter.	16
Don	16
Quixote	16
then	16
wiped	16
himself,	16
and	16
took	16
off	16
his	16
helmet	16
to	16
see	16
what	16
it	16
was	16
that	16
made	16
his	16
head	16
feel	16
so	16
cool,	16
and	16
seeing	16
all	16
that	16
white	16
mash	16
inside	16
his	16
helmet	16
he	16
put	16
it	16
to	16
his	16
nose,	16
and	16
as	16
soon	16
as	16
he	16
had	16
smelt	16
it	16
he	16
exclaimed:	16
“By	16
the	16
life	16
of	16
my	16
lady	16
Dulcinea	16
del	16
Toboso,	16
but	16
it	16
is	16
curds	16
thou	16
hast	16
put	16
here,	16
thou	16
treacherous,	16
impudent,	16
ill-mannered	16
squire!”	16
To	16
which,	16
with	16
great	16
composure	16
and	16
pretended	16
innocence,	16
Sancho	16
replied,	16
“If	16
they	16
are	16
curds	16
let	16
me	16
have	16
them,	16
your	16
worship,	16
and	16
I’ll	16
eat	16
them;	16
but	16
let	16
the	16
devil	16
eat	16
them,	16
for	16
it	16
must	16
have	16
been	16
he	16
who	16
put	16
them	16
there.	16
I	16
dare	16
to	16
dirty	16
your	16
helmet!	16
You	16
have	16
guessed	16
the	16
offender	16
finely!	16
Faith,	16
sir,	16
by	16
the	16
light	16
God	16
gives	16
me,	16
it	16
seems	16
I	16
must	16
have	16
enchanters	16
too,	16
that	16
persecute	16
me	16
as	16
a	16
creature	16
and	16
limb	16
of	16
your	16
worship,	16
and	16
they	16
must	16
have	16
put	16
that	16
nastiness	16
there	16
in	16
order	16
to	16
provoke	16
your	16
patience	16
to	16
anger,	16
and	16
make	16
you	16
baste	16
my	16
ribs	16
as	16
you	16
are	16
wont	16
to	16
do.	16
Well,	16
this	16
time,	16
indeed,	16
they	16
have	16
missed	16
their	16
aim,	16
for	16
I	16
trust	16
to	16
my	16
master’s	16
good	16
sense	16
to	16
see	16
that	16
I	16
have	16
got	16
no	16
curds	16
or	16
milk,	16
or	16
anything	16
of	16
the	16
sort;	16
and	16
that	16
if	16
I	16
had	16
it	16
is	16
in	16
my	16
stomach	16
I	16
would	16
put	16
it	16
and	16
not	16
in	16
the	16
helmet.”	16
“May	16
be	16
so,”	16
said	16
Don	16
Quixote.	16
All	16
this	16
the	16
gentleman	16
was	16
observing,	16
and	16
with	16
astonishment,	16
more	16
especially	16
when,	16
after	16
having	16
wiped	16
himself	16
clean,	16
his	16
head,	16
face,	16
beard,	16
and	16
helmet,	16
Don	16
Quixote	16
put	16
it	16
on,	16
and	16
settling	16
himself	16
firmly	16
in	16
his	16
stirrups,	16
easing	16
his	16
sword	16
in	16
the	16
scabbard,	16
and	16
grasping	16
his	16
lance,	16
he	16
cried,	16
“Now,	16
come	16
who	16
will,	16
here	16
am	16
I,	16
ready	16
to	16
try	16
conclusions	16
with	16
Satan	16
himself	16
in	16
person!”	16
By	16
this	16
time	16
the	16
cart	16
with	16
the	16
flags	16
had	16
come	16
up,	16
unattended	16
by	16
anyone	16
except	16
the	16
carter	16
on	16
a	16
mule,	16
and	16
a	16
man	16
sitting	16
in	16
front.	16
Don	16
Quixote	16
planted	16
himself	16
before	16
it	16
and	16
said,	16
“Whither	16
are	16
you	16
going,	16
brothers?	16
What	16
cart	16
is	16
this?	16
What	16
have	16
you	16
got	16
in	16
it?	16
What	16
flags	16
are	16
those?”	16
To	16
this	16
the	16
carter	16
replied,	16
“The	16
cart	16
is	16
mine;	16
what	16
is	16
in	16
it	16
is	16
a	16
pair	16
of	16
wild	16
caged	16
lions,	16
which	16
the	16
governor	16
of	16
Oran	16
is	16
sending	16
to	16
court	16
as	16
a	16
present	16
to	16
his	16
Majesty;	16
and	16
the	16
flags	16
are	16
our	16
lord	16
the	16
King’s,	16
to	16
show	16
that	16
what	16
is	16
here	16
is	16
his	16
property.”	16
“And	16
are	16
the	16
lions	16
large?”	16
asked	16
Don	16
Quixote.	16
“So	16
large,”	16
replied	16
the	16
man	16
who	16
sat	16
at	16
the	16
door	16
of	16
the	16
cart,	16
“that	16
larger,	16
or	16
as	16
large,	16
have	16
never	16
crossed	16
from	16
Africa	16
to	16
Spain;	16
I	16
am	16
the	16
keeper,	16
and	16
I	16
have	16
brought	16
over	16
others,	16
but	16
never	16
any	16
like	16
these.	16
They	16
are	16
male	16
and	16
female;	16
the	16
male	16
is	16
in	16
that	16
first	16
cage	16
and	16
the	16
female	16
in	16
the	16
one	16
behind,	16
and	16
they	16
are	16
hungry	16
now,	16
for	16
they	16
have	16
eaten	16
nothing	16
to-day,	16
so	16
let	16
your	16
worship	16
stand	16
aside,	16
for	16
we	16
must	16
make	16
haste	16
to	16
the	16
place	16
where	16
we	16
are	16
to	16
feed	16
them.”	16
Hereupon,	16
smiling	16
slightly,	16
Don	16
Quixote	16
exclaimed,	16
“Lion-whelps	16
to	16
me!	16
to	16
me	16
whelps	16
of	16
lions,	16
and	16
at	16
such	16
a	16
time!	16
Then,	16
by	16
God!	16
those	16
gentlemen	16
who	16
send	16
them	16
here	16
shall	16
see	16
if	16
I	16
am	16
a	16
man	16
to	16
be	16
frightened	16
by	16
lions.	16
Get	16
down,	16
my	16
good	16
fellow,	16
and	16
as	16
you	16
are	16
the	16
keeper	16
open	16
the	16
cages,	16
and	16
turn	16
me	16
out	16
those	16
beasts,	16
and	16
in	16
the	16
midst	16
of	16
this	16
plain	16
I	16
will	16
let	16
them	16
know	16
who	16
Don	16
Quixote	16
of	16
La	16
Mancha	16
is,	16
in	16
spite	16
and	16
in	16
the	16
teeth	16
of	16
the	16
enchanters	16
who	16
send	16
them	16
to	16
me.”	16
“So,	16
so,”	16
said	16
the	16
gentleman	16
to	16
himself	16
at	16
this;	16
“our	16
worthy	16
knight	16
has	16
shown	16
of	16
what	16
sort	16
he	16
is;	16
the	16
curds,	16
no	16
doubt,	16
have	16
softened	16
his	16
skull	16
and	16
brought	16
his	16
brains	16
to	16
a	16
head.”	16
At	16
this	16
instant	16
Sancho	16
came	16
up	16
to	16
him,	16
saying,	16
“Señor,	16
for	16
God’s	16
sake	16
do	16
something	16
to	16
keep	16
my	16
master,	16
Don	16
Quixote,	16
from	16
tackling	16
these	16
lions;	16
for	16
if	16
he	16
does	16
they’ll	16
tear	16
us	16
all	16
to	16
pieces	16
here.”	16
“Is	16
your	16
master	16
then	16
so	16
mad,”	16
asked	16
the	16
gentleman,	16
“that	16
you	16
believe	16
and	16
are	16
afraid	16
he	16
will	16
engage	16
such	16
fierce	16
animals?”	16
“He	16
is	16
not	16
mad,”	16
said	16
Sancho,	16
“but	16
he	16
is	16
venturesome.”	16
“I	16
will	16
prevent	16
it,”	16
said	16
the	16
gentleman;	16
and	16
going	16
over	16
to	16
Don	16
Quixote,	16
who	16
was	16
insisting	16
upon	16
the	16
keeper’s	16
opening	16
the	16
cages,	16
he	16
said	16
to	16
him,	16
“Sir	16
knight,	16
knights-errant	16
should	16
attempt	16
adventures	16
which	16
encourage	16
the	16
hope	16
of	16
a	16
successful	16
issue,	16
not	16
those	16
which	16
entirely	16
withhold	16
it;	16
for	16
valour	16
that	16
trenches	16
upon	16
temerity	16
savours	16
rather	16
of	16
madness	16
than	16
of	16
courage;	16
moreover,	16
these	16
lions	16
do	16
not	16
come	16
to	16
oppose	16
you,	16
nor	16
do	16
they	16
dream	16
of	16
such	16
a	16
thing;	16
they	16
are	16
going	16
as	16
presents	16
to	16
his	16
Majesty,	16
and	16
it	16
will	16
not	16
be	16
right	16
to	16
stop	16
them	16
or	16
delay	16
their	16
journey.”	16
“Gentle	16
sir,”	16
replied	16
Don	16
Quixote,	16
“you	16
go	16
and	16
mind	16
your	16
tame	16
partridge	16
and	16
your	16
bold	16
ferret,	16
and	16
leave	16
everyone	16
to	16
manage	16
his	16
own	16
business;	16
this	16
is	16
mine,	16
and	16
I	16
know	16
whether	16
these	16
gentlemen	16
the	16
lions	16
come	16
to	16
me	16
or	16
not;”	16
and	16
then	16
turning	16
to	16
the	16
keeper	16
he	16
exclaimed,	16
“By	16
all	16
that’s	16
good,	16
sir	16
scoundrel,	16
if	16
you	16
don’t	16
open	16
the	16
cages	16
this	16
very	16
instant,	16
I’ll	16
pin	16
you	16
to	16
the	16
cart	16
with	16
this	16
lance.”	16
The	16
carter,	16
seeing	16
the	16
determination	16
of	16
this	16
apparition	16
in	16
armour,	16
said	16
to	16
him,	16
“Please	16
your	16
worship,	16
for	16
charity’s	16
sake,	16
señor,	16
let	16
me	16
unyoke	16
the	16
mules	16
and	16
place	16
myself	16
in	16
safety	16
along	16
with	16
them	16
before	16
the	16
lions	16
are	16
turned	16
out;	16
for	16
if	16
they	16
kill	16
them	16
on	16
me	16
I	16
am	16
ruined	16
for	16
life,	16
for	16
all	16
I	16
possess	16
is	16
this	16
cart	16
and	16
mules.”	16
“O	16
man	16
of	16
little	16
faith,”	16
replied	16
Don	16
Quixote,	16
“get	16
down	16
and	16
unyoke;	16
you	16
will	16
soon	16
see	16
that	16
you	16
are	16
exerting	16
yourself	16
for	16
nothing,	16
and	16
that	16
you	16
might	16
have	16
spared	16
yourself	16
the	16
trouble.”	16
The	16
carter	16
got	16
down	16
and	16
with	16
all	16
speed	16
unyoked	16
the	16
mules,	16
and	16
the	16
keeper	16
called	16
out	16
at	16
the	16
top	16
of	16
his	16
voice,	16
“I	16
call	16
all	16
here	16
to	16
witness	16
that	16
against	16
my	16
will	16
and	16
under	16
compulsion	16
I	16
open	16
the	16
cages	16
and	16
let	16
the	16
lions	16
loose,	16
and	16
that	16
I	16
warn	16
this	16
gentleman	16
that	16
he	16
will	16
be	16
accountable	16
for	16
all	16
the	16
harm	16
and	16
mischief	16
which	16
these	16
beasts	16
may	16
do,	16
and	16
for	16
my	16
salary	16
and	16
dues	16
as	16
well.	16
You,	16
gentlemen,	16
place	16
yourselves	16
in	16
safety	16
before	16
I	16
open,	16
for	16
I	16
know	16
they	16
will	16
do	16
me	16
no	16
harm.”	16
Once	16
more	16
the	16
gentleman	16
strove	16
to	16
persuade	16
Don	16
Quixote	16
not	16
to	16
do	16
such	16
a	16
mad	16
thing,	16
as	16
it	16
was	16
tempting	16
God	16
to	16
engage	16
in	16
such	16
a	16
piece	16
of	16
folly.	16
To	16
this,	16
Don	16
Quixote	16
replied	16
that	16
he	16
knew	16
what	16
he	16
was	16
about.	16
The	16
gentleman	16
in	16
return	16
entreated	16
him	16
to	16
reflect,	16
for	16
he	16
knew	16
he	16
was	16
under	16
a	16
delusion.	16
“Well,	16
señor,”	16
answered	16
Don	16
Quixote,	16
“if	16
you	16
do	16
not	16
like	16
to	16
be	16
a	16
spectator	16
of	16
this	16
tragedy,	16
as	16
in	16
your	16
opinion	16
it	16
will	16
be,	16
spur	16
your	16
flea-bitten	16
mare,	16
and	16
place	16
yourself	16
in	16
safety.”	16
Hearing	16
this,	16
Sancho	16
with	16
tears	16
in	16
his	16
eyes	16
entreated	16
him	16
to	16
give	16
up	16
an	16
enterprise	16
compared	16
with	16
which	16
the	16
one	16
of	16
the	16
windmills,	16
and	16
the	16
awful	16
one	16
of	16
the	16
fulling	16
mills,	16
and,	16
in	16
fact,	16
all	16
the	16
feats	16
he	16
had	16
attempted	16
in	16
the	16
whole	16
course	16
of	16
his	16
life,	16
were	16
cakes	16
and	16
fancy	16
bread.	16
“Look	16
ye,	16
señor,”	16
said	16
Sancho,	16
“there’s	16
no	16
enchantment	16
here,	16
nor	16
anything	16
of	16
the	16
sort,	16
for	16
between	16
the	16
bars	16
and	16
chinks	16
of	16
the	16
cage	16
I	16
have	16
seen	16
the	16
paw	16
of	16
a	16
real	16
lion,	16
and	16
judging	16
by	16
that	16
I	16
reckon	16
the	16
lion	16
such	16
a	16
paw	16
could	16
belong	16
to	16
must	16
be	16
bigger	16
than	16
a	16
mountain.”	16
“Fear	16
at	16
any	16
rate,”	16
replied	16
Don	16
Quixote,	16
“will	16
make	16
him	16
look	16
bigger	16
to	16
thee	16
than	16
half	16
the	16
world.	16
Retire,	16
Sancho,	16
and	16
leave	16
me;	16
and	16
if	16
I	16
die	16
here	16
thou	16
knowest	16
our	16
old	16
compact;	16
thou	16
wilt	16
repair	16
to	16
Dulcinea—I	16
say	16
no	16
more.”	16
To	16
these	16
he	16
added	16
some	16
further	16
words	16
that	16
banished	16
all	16
hope	16
of	16
his	16
giving	16
up	16
his	16
insane	16
project.	16
He	16
of	16
the	16
green	16
gaban	16
would	16
have	16
offered	16
resistance,	16
but	16
he	16
found	16
himself	16
ill-matched	16
as	16
to	16
arms,	16
and	16
did	16
not	16
think	16
it	16
prudent	16
to	16
come	16
to	16
blows	16
with	16
a	16
madman,	16
for	16
such	16
Don	16
Quixote	16
now	16
showed	16
himself	16
to	16
be	16
in	16
every	16
respect;	16
and	16
the	16
latter,	16
renewing	16
his	16
commands	16
to	16
the	16
keeper	16
and	16
repeating	16
his	16
threats,	16
gave	16
warning	16
to	16
the	16
gentleman	16
to	16
spur	16
his	16
mare,	16
Sancho	16
his	16
Dapple,	16
and	16
the	16
carter	16
his	16
mules,	16
all	16
striving	16
to	16
get	16
away	16
from	16
the	16
cart	16
as	16
far	16
as	16
they	16
could	16
before	16
the	16
lions	16
broke	16
loose.	16
Sancho	16
was	16
weeping	16
over	16
his	16
master’s	16
death,	16
for	16
this	16
time	16
he	16
firmly	16
believed	16
it	16
was	16
in	16
store	16
for	16
him	16
from	16
the	16
claws	16
of	16
the	16
lions;	16
and	16
he	16
cursed	16
his	16
fate	16
and	16
called	16
it	16
an	16
unlucky	16
hour	16
when	16
he	16
thought	16
of	16
taking	16
service	16
with	16
him	16
again;	16
but	16
with	16
all	16
his	16
tears	16
and	16
lamentations	16
he	16
did	16
not	16
forget	16
to	16
thrash	16
Dapple	16
so	16
as	16
to	16
put	16
a	16
good	16
space	16
between	16
himself	16
and	16
the	16
cart.	16
The	16
keeper,	16
seeing	16
that	16
the	16
fugitives	16
were	16
now	16
some	16
distance	16
off,	16
once	16
more	16
entreated	16
and	16
warned	16
him	16
as	16
before;	16
but	16
he	16
replied	16
that	16
he	16
heard	16
him,	16
and	16
that	16
he	16
need	16
not	16
trouble	16
himself	16
with	16
any	16
further	16
warnings	16
or	16
entreaties,	16
as	16
they	16
would	16
be	16
fruitless,	16
and	16
bade	16
him	16
make	16
haste.	16
During	16
the	16
delay	16
that	16
occurred	16
while	16
the	16
keeper	16
was	16
opening	16
the	16
first	16
cage,	16
Don	16
Quixote	16
was	16
considering	16
whether	16
it	16
would	16
not	16
be	16
well	16
to	16
do	16
battle	16
on	16
foot,	16
instead	16
of	16
on	16
horseback,	16
and	16
finally	16
resolved	16
to	16
fight	16
on	16
foot,	16
fearing	16
that	16
Rocinante	16
might	16
take	16
fright	16
at	16
the	16
sight	16
of	16
the	16
lions;	16
he	16
therefore	16
sprang	16
off	16
his	16
horse,	16
flung	16
his	16
lance	16
aside,	16
braced	16
his	16
buckler	16
on	16
his	16
arm,	16
and	16
drawing	16
his	16
sword,	16
advanced	16
slowly	16
with	16
marvellous	16
intrepidity	16
and	16
resolute	16
courage,	16
to	16
plant	16
himself	16
in	16
front	16
of	16
the	16
cart,	16
commending	16
himself	16
with	16
all	16
his	16
heart	16
to	16
God	16
and	16
to	16
his	16
lady	16
Dulcinea.	16
It	16
is	16
to	16
be	16
observed,	16
that	16
on	16
coming	16
to	16
this	16
passage,	16
the	16
author	16
of	16
this	16
veracious	16
history	16
breaks	16
out	16
into	16
exclamations.	16
“O	16
doughty	16
Don	16
Quixote!	16
high-mettled	16
past	16
extolling!	16
Mirror,	16
wherein	16
all	16
the	16
heroes	16
of	16
the	16
world	16
may	16
see	16
themselves!	16
Second	16

Don	16
Manuel	16
de	16
Leon,	16
once	16
the	16
glory	16
and	16
honour	16
of	16
Spanish	16
knighthood!	16
In	16
what	16
words	16
shall	16
I	16
describe	16
this	16
dread	16
exploit,	16
by	16
what	16
language	16
shall	16
I	16
make	16
it	16
credible	16
to	16
ages	16
to	16
come,	16
what	16
eulogies	16
are	16
there	16
unmeet	16
for	16
thee,	16
though	16
they	16
be	16
hyperboles	16
piled	16
on	16
hyperboles!	16
On	16
foot,	16
alone,	16
undaunted,	16
high-souled,	16
with	16
but	16
a	16
simple	16
sword,	16
and	16
that	16
no	16
trenchant	16
blade	16
of	16
the	16
Perrillo	16
brand,	16
a	16
shield,	16
but	16
no	16
bright	16
polished	16
steel	16
one,	16
there	16
stoodst	16
thou,	16
biding	16
and	16
awaiting	16
the	16
two	16
fiercest	16
lions	16
that	16
Africa’s	16
forests	16
ever	16
bred!	16
Thy	16
own	16
deeds	16
be	16
thy	16
praise,	16
valiant	16
Manchegan,	16
and	16
here	16
I	16
leave	16
them	16
as	16
they	16
stand,	16
wanting	16
the	16
words	16
wherewith	16
to	16
glorify	16
them!”	16

Here	16
the	16

outburst	16
came	16
to	16
an	16

he	16
proceeded	16
to	16
take	16
up	16
the	16
thread	16
of	16
his	16
story,	16
saying	16
that	16
the	16
keeper,	16
seeing	16
that	16
Don	16
Quixote	16
had	16
taken	16
up	16
his	16
position,	16
and	16
that	16
it	16
was	16
impossible	16
for	16
him	16
to	16
avoid	16
letting	16
out	16
the	16
male	16
without	16
incurring	16
the	16
enmity	16
of	16
the	16
fiery	16
and	16
daring	16
knight,	16
flung	16
open	16
the	16
doors	16
of	16
the	16
first	16
cage,	16
containing,	16
as	16
has	16
been	16
said,	16
the	16
lion,	16
which	16
was	16
now	16
seen	16
to	16
be	16
of	16
enormous	16
size,	16
and	16
grim	16
and	16
hideous	16
mien.	16
The	16
first	16
thing	16
he	16
did	16
was	16
to	16
turn	16
round	16
in	16
the	16
cage	16
in	16
which	16
he	16
lay,	16
and	16
protrude	16
his	16
claws,	16
and	16
stretch	16
himself	16
thoroughly;	16
he	16
next	16
opened	16
his	16
mouth,	16
and	16
yawned	16
very	16
leisurely,	16
and	16
with	16
near	16
two	16
palms’	16
length	16
of	16
tongue	16
that	16
he	16
had	16
thrust	16
forth,	16
he	16
licked	16
the	16
dust	16
out	16
of	16
his	16
eyes	16
and	16
washed	16
his	16
face;	16
having	16
done	16
this,	16
he	16
put	16
his	16
head	16
out	16
of	16
the	16
cage	16
and	16
looked	16
all	16
round	16
with	16
eyes	16
like	16
glowing	16
coals,	16
a	16
spectacle	16
and	16
demeanour	16
to	16
strike	16
terror	16
into	16
temerity	16
itself.	16
Don	16
Quixote	16
merely	16
observed	16
him	16
steadily,	16
longing	16
for	16
him	16
to	16
leap	16
from	16
the	16
cart	16
and	16
come	16
to	16
close	16
quarters	16
with	16
him,	16
when	16
he	16
hoped	16
to	16
hew	16
him	16
in	16
pieces.	16
So	16
far	16
did	16
his	16
unparalleled	16
madness	16
go;	16
but	16
the	16
noble	16
lion,	16
more	16
courteous	16
than	16
arrogant,	16
not	16
troubling	16
himself	16
about	16
silly	16
bravado,	16
after	16
having	16
looked	16
all	16
round,	16
as	16
has	16
been	16
said,	16
turned	16
about	16
and	16
presented	16
his	16
hind-quarters	16
to	16
Don	16
Quixote,	16
and	16
very	16
coolly	16
and	16
tranquilly	16
lay	16
down	16
again	16
in	16
the	16
cage.	16
Seeing	16
this,	16
Don	16
Quixote	16
ordered	16
the	16
keeper	16
to	16
take	16
a	16
stick	16
to	16
him	16
and	16
provoke	16
him	16
to	16
make	16
him	16
come	16
out.	16
“That	16
I	16
won’t,”	16
said	16
the	16
keeper;	16
“for	16
if	16
I	16
anger	16
him,	16
the	16
first	16
he’ll	16
tear	16
in	16
pieces	16
will	16
be	16
myself.	16
Be	16
satisfied,	16
sir	16
knight,	16
with	16
what	16
you	16
have	16
done,	16
which	16
leaves	16
nothing	16
more	16
to	16
be	16
said	16
on	16
the	16
score	16
of	16
courage,	16
and	16
do	16
not	16
seek	16
to	16
tempt	16
fortune	16
a	16
second	16
time.	16
The	16
lion	16
has	16
the	16
door	16
open;	16
he	16
is	16
free	16
to	16
come	16
out	16
or	16
not	16
to	16
come	16
out;	16
but	16
as	16
he	16
has	16
not	16
come	16
out	16
so	16
far,	16
he	16
will	16
not	16
come	16
out	16
to-day.	16
Your	16
worship’s	16
great	16
courage	16
has	16
been	16
fully	16
manifested	16
already;	16
no	16
brave	16
champion,	16
so	16
it	16
strikes	16
me,	16
is	16
bound	16
to	16
do	16
more	16
than	16
challenge	16
his	16
enemy	16
and	16
wait	16
for	16
him	16
on	16
the	16
field;	16
if	16
his	16
adversary	16
does	16
not	16
come,	16
on	16
him	16
lies	16
the	16
disgrace,	16
and	16
he	16
who	16
waits	16
for	16
him	16
carries	16
off	16
the	16
crown	16
of	16
victory.”	16
“That	16
is	16
true,”	16
said	16
Don	16
Quixote;	16
“close	16
the	16
door,	16
my	16
friend,	16
and	16
let	16
me	16
have,	16
in	16
the	16
best	16
form	16
thou	16
canst,	16
what	16
thou	16
hast	16
seen	16
me	16
do,	16
by	16
way	16
of	16
certificate;	16
to	16
wit,	16
that	16
thou	16
didst	16
open	16
for	16
the	16
lion,	16
that	16
I	16
waited	16
for	16
him,	16
that	16
he	16
did	16
not	16
come	16
out,	16
that	16
I	16
still	16
waited	16
for	16
him,	16
and	16
that	16
still	16
he	16
did	16
not	16
come	16
out,	16
and	16
lay	16
down	16
again.	16
I	16
am	16
not	16
bound	16
to	16
do	16
more;	16
enchantments	16
avaunt,	16
and	16
God	16
uphold	16
the	16
right,	16
the	16
truth,	16
and	16
true	16
chivalry!	16
Close	16
the	16
door	16
as	16
I	16
bade	16
thee,	16
while	16
I	16
make	16
signals	16
to	16
the	16
fugitives	16
that	16
have	16
left	16
us,	16
that	16
they	16
may	16
learn	16
this	16
exploit	16
from	16
thy	16
lips.”	16
The	16
keeper	16
obeyed,	16
and	16
Don	16
Quixote,	16
fixing	16
on	16
the	16
point	16
of	16
his	16
lance	16
the	16
cloth	16
he	16
had	16
wiped	16
his	16
face	16
with	16
after	16
the	16
deluge	16
of	16
curds,	16
proceeded	16
to	16
recall	16
the	16
others,	16
who	16
still	16
continued	16
to	16
fly,	16
looking	16
back	16
at	16
every	16
step,	16
all	16
in	16
a	16
body,	16
the	16
gentleman	16
bringing	16
up	16
the	16
rear.	16
Sancho,	16
however,	16
happening	16
to	16
observe	16
the	16
signal	16
of	16
the	16
white	16
cloth,	16
exclaimed,	16
“May	16
I	16
die,	16
if	16
my	16
master	16
has	16
not	16
overcome	16
the	16
wild	16
beasts,	16
for	16
he	16
is	16
calling	16
to	16
us.”	16
They	16
all	16
stopped,	16
and	16
perceived	16
that	16
it	16
was	16
Don	16
Quixote	16
who	16
was	16
making	16
signals,	16
and	16
shaking	16
off	16
their	16
fears	16
to	16
some	16
extent,	16
they	16
approached	16
slowly	16
until	16
they	16
were	16
near	16
enough	16
to	16
hear	16
distinctly	16
Don	16
Quixote’s	16
voice	16
calling	16
to	16
them.	16
They	16
returned	16
at	16
length	16
to	16
the	16
cart,	16
and	16
as	16
they	16
came	16
up,	16
Don	16
Quixote	16
said	16
to	16
the	16
carter,	16
“Put	16
your	16
mules	16
to	16
once	16
more,	16
brother,	16
and	16
continue	16
your	16
journey;	16
and	16
do	16
thou,	16
Sancho,	16
give	16
him	16
two	16
gold	16
crowns	16
for	16
himself	16
and	16
the	16
keeper,	16
to	16
compensate	16
for	16
the	16
delay	16
they	16
have	16
incurred	16
through	16
me.”	16
“That	16
will	16
I	16
give	16
with	16
all	16
my	16
heart,”	16
said	16
Sancho;	16
“but	16
what	16
has	16
become	16
of	16
the	16
lions?	16
Are	16
they	16
dead	16
or	16
alive?”	16
The	16
keeper,	16
then,	16
in	16
full	16
detail,	16
and	16
bit	16
by	16
bit,	16
described	16
the	16
end	16
of	16
the	16
contest,	16
exalting	16
to	16
the	16
best	16
of	16
his	16
power	16
and	16
ability	16
the	16
valour	16
of	16
Don	16
Quixote,	16
at	16
the	16
sight	16
of	16
whom	16
the	16
lion	16
quailed,	16
and	16
would	16
not	16
and	16
dared	16
not	16
come	16
out	16
of	16
the	16
cage,	16
although	16
he	16
had	16
held	16
the	16
door	16
open	16
ever	16
so	16
long;	16
and	16
showing	16
how,	16
in	16
consequence	16
of	16
his	16
having	16
represented	16
to	16
the	16
knight	16
that	16
it	16
was	16
tempting	16
God	16
to	16
provoke	16
the	16
lion	16
in	16
order	16
to	16
force	16
him	16
out,	16
which	16
he	16
wished	16
to	16
have	16
done,	16
he	16
very	16
reluctantly,	16
and	16
altogether	16
against	16
his	16
will,	16
had	16
allowed	16
the	16
door	16
to	16
be	16
closed.	16
“What	16
dost	16
thou	16
think	16
of	16
this,	16
Sancho?”	16
said	16
Don	16
Quixote.	16
“Are	16
there	16
any	16
enchantments	16
that	16
can	16
prevail	16
against	16
true	16
valour?	16
The	16
enchanters	16
may	16
be	16
able	16
to	16
rob	16
me	16
of	16
good	16
fortune,	16
but	16
of	16
fortitude	16
and	16
courage	16
they	16
cannot.”	16
Sancho	16
paid	16
the	16
crowns,	16
the	16
carter	16
put	16
to,	16
the	16
keeper	16
kissed	16
Don	16
Quixote’s	16
hands	16
for	16
the	16
bounty	16
bestowed	16
upon	16
him,	16
and	16
promised	16
to	16
give	16
an	16
account	16
of	16
the	16
valiant	16
exploit	16
to	16
the	16
King	16
himself,	16
as	16
soon	16
as	16
he	16
saw	16
him	16
at	16
court.	16
“Then,”	16
said	16
Don	16
Quixote,	16
“if	16
his	16
Majesty	16
should	16
happen	16
to	16
ask	16
who	16
performed	16
it,	16
you	16
must	16
say	16
THE	16
KNIGHT	16
OF	16
THE	16
LIONS;	16
for	16
it	16
is	16
my	16
desire	16
that	16
into	16
this	16
the	16
name	16
I	16
have	16
hitherto	16
borne	16
of	16
Knight	16
of	16
the	16
Rueful	16
Countenance	16
be	16
from	16
this	16
time	16
forward	16
changed,	16
altered,	16
transformed,	16
and	16
turned;	16
and	16
in	16
this	16
I	16
follow	16
the	16
ancient	16
usage	16
of	16
knights-errant,	16
who	16
changed	16
their	16
names	16
when	16
they	16
pleased,	16
or	16
when	16
it	16
suited	16
their	16
purpose.”	16
The	16
cart	16
went	16
its	16
way,	16
and	16
Don	16
Quixote,	16
Sancho,	16
and	16
he	16
of	16
the	16
green	16
gaban	16
went	16
theirs.	16
All	16
this	16
time,	16
Don	16
Diego	16
de	16
Miranda	16
had	16
not	16
spoken	16
a	16
word,	16
being	16
entirely	16
taken	16
up	16
with	16
observing	16
and	16
noting	16
all	16
that	16
Don	16
Quixote	16
did	16
and	16
said,	16
and	16
the	16
opinion	16
he	16
formed	16
was	16
that	16
he	16
was	16
a	16
man	16
of	16
brains	16
gone	16
mad,	16
and	16
a	16
madman	16
on	16
the	16
verge	16
of	16
rationality.	16
The	16
first	16
part	16
of	16
his	16
history	16
had	16
not	16
yet	16
reached	16
him,	16
for,	16
had	16
he	16
read	16
it,	16
the	16
amazement	16
with	16
which	16
his	16
words	16
and	16
deeds	16
filled	16
him	16
would	16
have	16
vanished,	16
as	16
he	16
would	16
then	16
have	16
understood	16
the	16
nature	16
of	16
his	16
madness;	16
but	16
knowing	16
nothing	16
of	16
it,	16
he	16
took	16
him	16
to	16
be	16
rational	16
one	16
moment,	16
and	16
crazy	16
the	16
next,	16
for	16
what	16
he	16
said	16
was	16
sensible,	16
elegant,	16
and	16
well	16
expressed,	16
and	16
what	16
he	16
did,	16
absurd,	16
rash,	16
and	16
foolish;	16
and	16
said	16
he	16
to	16
himself,	16
“What	16
could	16
be	16
madder	16
than	16
putting	16
on	16
a	16
helmet	16
full	16
of	16
curds,	16
and	16
then	16
persuading	16
oneself	16
that	16
enchanters	16
are	16
softening	16
one’s	16
skull;	16
or	16
what	16
could	16
be	16
greater	16
rashness	16
and	16
folly	16
than	16
wanting	16
to	16
fight	16
lions	16
tooth	16
and	16
nail?”	16
Don	16
Quixote	16
roused	16
him	16
from	16
these	16
reflections	16
and	16
this	16
soliloquy	16
by	16
saying,	16
“No	16
doubt,	16
Señor	16
Don	16
Diego	16
de	16
Miranda,	16
you	16
set	16
me	16
down	16
in	16
your	16
mind	16
as	16
a	16
fool	16
and	16
a	16
madman,	16
and	16
it	16
would	16
be	16
no	16
wonder	16
if	16
you	16
did,	16
for	16
my	16
deeds	16
do	16
not	16
argue	16
anything	16
else.	16
But	16
for	16
all	16
that,	16
I	16
would	16
have	16
you	16
take	16
notice	16
that	16
I	16
am	16
neither	16
so	16
mad	16
nor	16
so	16
foolish	16
as	16
I	16
must	16
have	16
seemed	16
to	16
you.	16
A	16
gallant	16
knight	16
shows	16
to	16
advantage	16
bringing	16
his	16
lance	16
to	16
bear	16
adroitly	16
upon	16
a	16
fierce	16
bull	16
under	16
the	16
eyes	16
of	16
his	16
sovereign,	16
in	16
the	16
midst	16
of	16
a	16
spacious	16
plaza;	16
a	16
knight	16
shows	16
to	16
advantage	16
arrayed	16
in	16
glittering	16
armour,	16
pacing	16
the	16
lists	16
before	16
the	16
ladies	16
in	16
some	16
joyous	16
tournament,	16
and	16
all	16
those	16
knights	16
show	16
to	16
advantage	16
that	16
entertain,	16
divert,	16
and,	16
if	16
we	16
may	16
say	16
so,	16
honour	16
the	16
courts	16
of	16
their	16
princes	16
by	16
warlike	16
exercises,	16
or	16
what	16
resemble	16
them;	16
but	16
to	16
greater	16
advantage	16
than	16
all	16
these	16
does	16
a	16
knight-errant	16
show	16
when	16
he	16
traverses	16
deserts,	16
solitudes,	16
cross-roads,	16
forests,	16
and	16
mountains,	16
in	16
quest	16
of	16
perilous	16
adventures,	16
bent	16
on	16
bringing	16
them	16
to	16
a	16
happy	16
and	16
successful	16
issue,	16
all	16
to	16
win	16
a	16
glorious	16
and	16
lasting	16
renown.	16
To	16
greater	16
advantage,	16
I	16
maintain,	16
does	16
the	16
knight-errant	16
show	16
bringing	16
aid	16
to	16
some	16
widow	16
in	16
some	16
lonely	16
waste,	16
than	16
the	16
court	16
knight	16
dallying	16
with	16
some	16
city	16
damsel.	16
All	16
knights	16
have	16
their	16
own	16
special	16
parts	16
to	16
play;	16
let	16
the	16
courtier	16
devote	16
himself	16
to	16
the	16
ladies,	16
let	16
him	16
add	16
lustre	16
to	16
his	16
sovereign’s	16
court	16
by	16
his	16
liveries,	16
let	16
him	16
entertain	16
poor	16
gentlemen	16
with	16
the	16
sumptuous	16
fare	16
of	16
his	16
table,	16
let	16
him	16
arrange	16
joustings,	16
marshal	16
tournaments,	16
and	16
prove	16
himself	16
noble,	16
generous,	16
and	16
magnificent,	16
and	16
above	16
all	16
a	16
good	16
Christian,	16
and	16
so	16
doing	16
he	16
will	16
fulfil	16
the	16
duties	16
that	16
are	16
especially	16
his;	16
but	16
let	16
the	16
knight-errant	16
explore	16
the	16
corners	16
of	16
the	16
earth	16
and	16
penetrate	16
the	16
most	16
intricate	16
labyrinths,	16
at	16
each	16
step	16
let	16
him	16
attempt	16
impossibilities,	16
on	16
desolate	16
heaths	16
let	16
him	16
endure	16
the	16
burning	16
rays	16
of	16
the	16
midsummer	16
sun,	16
and	16
the	16
bitter	16
inclemency	16
of	16
the	16
winter	16
winds	16
and	16
frosts;	16
let	16
no	16
lions	16
daunt	16
him,	16
no	16
monsters	16
terrify	16
him,	16
no	16
dragons	16
make	16
him	16
quail;	16
for	16
to	16
seek	16
these,	16
to	16
attack	16
those,	16
and	16
to	16
vanquish	16
all,	16
are	16
in	16
truth	16
his	16
main	16
duties.	16
I,	16
then,	16
as	16
it	16
has	16
fallen	16
to	16
my	16
lot	16
to	16
be	16
a	16
member	16
of	16
knight-errantry,	16
cannot	16
avoid	16
attempting	16
all	16
that	16
to	16
me	16
seems	16
to	16
come	16
within	16
the	16
sphere	16
of	16
my	16
duties;	16
thus	16
it	16
was	16
my	16
bounden	16
duty	16
to	16
attack	16
those	16
lions	16
that	16
I	16
just	16
now	16
attacked,	16
although	16
I	16
knew	16
it	16
to	16
be	16
the	16
height	16
of	16
rashness;	16
for	16
I	16
know	16
well	16
what	16
valour	16
is,	16
that	16
it	16
is	16
a	16
virtue	16
that	16
occupies	16
a	16
place	16
between	16
two	16
vicious	16
extremes,	16
cowardice	16
and	16
temerity;	16
but	16
it	16
will	16
be	16
a	16
lesser	16
evil	16
for	16
him	16
who	16
is	16
valiant	16
to	16
rise	16
till	16
he	16
reaches	16
the	16
point	16
of	16
rashness,	16
than	16
to	16
sink	16
until	16
he	16
reaches	16
the	16
point	16
of	16
cowardice;	16
for,	16
as	16
it	16
is	16
easier	16
for	16
the	16
prodigal	16
than	16
for	16
the	16
miser	16
to	16
become	16
generous,	16
so	16
it	16
is	16
easier	16
for	16
a	16
rash	16
man	16
to	16
prove	16
truly	16
valiant	16
than	16
for	16
a	16
coward	16
to	16
rise	16
to	16
true	16
valour;	16
and	16
believe	16
me,	16
Señor	16
Don	16
Diego,	16
in	16
attempting	16
adventures	16
it	16
is	16
better	16
to	16
lose	16
by	16
a	16
card	16
too	16
many	16
than	16
by	16
a	16
card	16
too	16
few;	16
for	16
to	16
hear	16
it	16
said,	16
‘such	16
a	16
knight	16
is	16
rash	16
and	16
daring,’	16
sounds	16
better	16
than	16
‘such	16
a	16
knight	16
is	16
timid	16
and	16
cowardly.’”	16
“I	16
protest,	16
Señor	16
Don	16
Quixote,”	16
said	16
Don	16
Diego,	16
“everything	16
you	16
have	16
said	16
and	16
done	16
is	16
proved	16
correct	16
by	16
the	16
test	16
of	16
reason	16
itself;	16
and	16
I	16
believe,	16
if	16
the	16
laws	16
and	16
ordinances	16
of	16
knight-errantry	16
should	16
be	16
lost,	16
they	16
might	16
be	16
found	16
in	16
your	16
worship’s	16
breast	16
as	16
in	16
their	16
own	16
proper	16
depository	16
and	16
muniment-house;	16
but	16
let	16
us	16
make	16
haste,	16
and	16
reach	16
my	16
village,	16
where	16
you	16
shall	16
take	16
rest	16
after	16
your	16
late	16
exertions;	16
for	16
if	16
they	16
have	16
not	16
been	16
of	16
the	16
body	16
they	16
have	16
been	16
of	16
the	16
spirit,	16
and	16
these	16
sometimes	16
tend	16
to	16
produce	16
bodily	16
fatigue.”	16
“I	16
take	16
the	16
invitation	16
as	16
a	16
great	16
favour	16
and	16
honour,	16
Señor	16

Diego,”	16
replied	16
Don	16
Quixote;	16
and	16
pressing	16
forward	16
at	16
a	16
better	16
pace	16
than	16
before,	16
at	16

him,	16

The	16
student	16
poet,	16
Don	16
Diego’s	16
son,	16
who	16
had	16
come	16
out	16
with	16
his	16
mother	16
to	16
receive	16
him,	16
heard	16
this	16
exclamation,	16
and	16
both	16
mother	16
and	16
son	16
were	16
filled	16
with	16
amazement	16
at	16
the	16
extraordinary	16
figure	16
he	16
presented;	16
he,	16
however,	16
dismounting	16
from	16
Rocinante,	16
advanced	16
with	16
great	16
politeness	16
to	16
ask	16
permission	16
to	16
kiss	16
the	16
lady’s	16
hand,	16
while	16
Don	16
Diego	16
said,	16
“Señora,	16
pray	16
receive	16
with	16
your	16
wonted	16
kindness	16
Señor	16
Don	16
Quixote	16
of	16
La	16
Mancha,	16
whom	16
you	16
see	16
before	16
you,	16
a	16
knight-errant,	16
and	16
the	16
bravest	16
and	16
wisest	16
in	16
the	16
world.”	16
The	16
lady,	16
whose	16
name	16
was	16
Doña	16
Christina,	16
received	16
him	16
with	16
every	16
sign	16
of	16
good-will	16
and	16
great	16
courtesy,	16
and	16
Don	16
Quixote	16
placed	16
himself	16
at	16
her	16
service	16
with	16
an	16
abundance	16
of	16
well-chosen	16
and	16
polished	16
phrases.	16
Almost	16
the	16
same	16
civilities	16
were	16
exchanged	16
between	16
him	16
and	16
the	16
student,	16
who	16
listening	16
to	16
Don	16
Quixote,	16
took	16
him	16
to	16
be	16
a	16
sensible,	16
clear-headed	16
person.	16
Here	16
the	16
author	16
describes	16
minutely	16
everything	16
belonging	16
to	16
Don	16
Diego’s	16
mansion,	16
putting	16
before	16
us	16
in	16
his	16
picture	16
the	16
whole	16
contents	16
of	16
a	16
rich	16
gentleman-farmer’s	16
house;	16
but	16
the	16
translator	16
of	16
the	16
history	16
thought	16
it	16
best	16
to	16
pass	16
over	16
these	16
and	16
other	16
details	16
of	16
the	16
same	16
sort	16
in	16
silence,	16
as	16
they	16
are	16
not	16
in	16
harmony	16
with	16
the	16
main	16
purpose	16
of	16
the	16
story,	16
the	16
strong	16
point	16
of	16
which	16
is	16
truth	16
rather	16
than	16
dull	16
digressions.	16
They	16
led	16
Don	16
Quixote	16
into	16
a	16
room,	16
and	16
Sancho	16
removed	16
his	16
armour,	16
leaving	16
him	16
in	16
loose	16
Walloon	16
breeches	16
and	16
chamois-leather	16
doublet,	16
all	16
stained	16
with	16
the	16
rust	16
of	16
his	16
armour;	16
his	16
collar	16
was	16
a	16
falling	16
one	16
of	16
scholastic	16
cut,	16
without	16
starch	16
or	16
lace,	16
his	16
buskins	16
buff-coloured,	16
and	16
his	16
shoes	16
polished.	16
He	16
wore	16
his	16
good	16
sword,	16
which	16
hung	16
in	16
a	16
baldric	16
of	16
sea-wolf’s	16
skin,	16
for	16
he	16
had	16
suffered	16
for	16
many	16
years,	16
they	16
say,	16
from	16
an	16
ailment	16
of	16
the	16
kidneys;	16
and	16
over	16
all	16
he	16
threw	16
a	16
long	16
cloak	16
of	16
good	16
grey	16
cloth.	16
But	16
first	16
of	16
all,	16
with	16
five	16
or	16
six	16
buckets	16
of	16
water	16
(for	16
as	16
regard	16
the	16
number	16
of	16
buckets	16
there	16
is	16
some	16
dispute),	16
he	16
washed	16
his	16
head	16
and	16
face,	16
and	16
still	16
the	16
water	16
remained	16
whey-coloured,	16
thanks	16
to	16
Sancho’s	16
greediness	16
and	16
purchase	16
of	16
those	16
unlucky	16
curds	16
that	16
turned	16
his	16
master	16
so	16
white.	16
Thus	16
arrayed,	16
and	16
with	16
an	16
easy,	16
sprightly,	16
and	16
gallant	16
air,	16
Don	16
Quixote	16
passed	16
out	16
into	16
another	16
room,	16
where	16
the	16
student	16
was	16
waiting	16
to	16
entertain	16
him	16
while	16
the	16
table	16
was	16
being	16
laid;	16
for	16
on	16
the	16
arrival	16
of	16
so	16
distinguished	16
a	16
guest,	16
Doña	16
Christina	16
was	16
anxious	16
to	16
show	16
that	16
she	16
knew	16
how	16
and	16
was	16
able	16
to	16
give	16
a	16
becoming	16
reception	16
to	16
those	16
who	16
came	16
to	16
her	16
house.	16
While	16
Don	16
Quixote	16
was	16
taking	16
off	16
his	16
armour,	16
Don	16
Lorenzo	16
(for	16
so	16
Don	16
Diego’s	16
son	16
was	16
called)	16
took	16
the	16
opportunity	16
to	16
say	16
to	16
his	16
father,	16
“What	16
are	16
we	16
to	16
make	16
of	16
this	16
gentleman	16
you	16
have	16
brought	16
home	16
to	16
us,	16
sir?	16
For	16
his	16
name,	16
his	16
appearance,	16
and	16
your	16
describing	16
him	16
as	16
a	16
knight-errant	16
have	16
completely	16
puzzled	16
my	16
mother	16
and	16
me.”	16
“I	16
don’t	16
know	16
what	16
to	16
say,	16
my	16
son,”	16
replied.	16
Don	16
Diego;	16
“all	16
I	16
can	16
tell	16
thee	16
is	16
that	16
I	16
have	16
seen	16
him	16
act	16
the	16
acts	16
of	16
the	16
greatest	16
madman	16
in	16
the	16
world,	16
and	16
heard	16
him	16
make	16
observations	16
so	16
sensible	16
that	16
they	16
efface	16
and	16
undo	16
all	16
he	16
does;	16
do	16
thou	16
talk	16
to	16
him	16
and	16
feel	16
the	16
pulse	16
of	16
his	16
wits,	16
and	16
as	16
thou	16
art	16
shrewd,	16
form	16
the	16
most	16
reasonable	16
conclusion	16
thou	16
canst	16
as	16
to	16
his	16
wisdom	16
or	16
folly;	16
though,	16
to	16
tell	16
the	16
truth,	16
I	16
am	16
more	16
inclined	16
to	16
take	16
him	16
to	16
be	16
mad	16
than	16
sane.”	16
With	16
this	16
Don	16
Lorenzo	16
went	16
away	16
to	16
entertain	16
Don	16
Quixote	16
as	16
has	16
been	16
said,	16
and	16
in	16
the	16
course	16
of	16
the	16
conversation	16
that	16
passed	16
between	16
them	16
Don	16
Quixote	16
said	16
to	16
Don	16
Lorenzo,	16
“Your	16
father,	16
Señor	16
Don	16
Diego	16
de	16
Miranda,	16
has	16
told	16
me	16
of	16
the	16
rare	16
abilities	16
and	16
subtle	16
intellect	16
you	16
possess,	16
and,	16
above	16
all,	16
that	16
you	16
are	16
a	16
great	16
poet.”	16
“A	16
poet,	16
it	16
may	16
be,”	16
replied	16
Don	16
Lorenzo,	16
“but	16
a	16
great	16
one,	16
by	16
no	16
means.	16
It	16
is	16
true	16
that	16
I	16
am	16
somewhat	16
given	16
to	16
poetry	16
and	16
to	16
reading	16
good	16
poets,	16
but	16
not	16
so	16
much	16
so	16
as	16
to	16
justify	16
the	16
title	16
of	16
‘great’	16
which	16
my	16
father	16
gives	16
me.”	16
“I	16
do	16
not	16
dislike	16
that	16
modesty,”	16
said	16
Don	16
Quixote;	16
“for	16
there	16
is	16
no	16
poet	16
who	16
is	16
not	16
conceited	16
and	16
does	16
not	16
think	16
he	16
is	16
the	16
best	16
poet	16
in	16
the	16
world.”	16
“There	16
is	16
no	16
rule	16
without	16
an	16
exception,”	16
said	16
Don	16
Lorenzo;	16
“there	16
may	16
be	16
some	16
who	16
are	16
poets	16
and	16
yet	16
do	16
not	16
think	16
they	16
are.”	16
“Very	16
few,”	16
said	16
Don	16
Quixote;	16
“but	16
tell	16
me,	16
what	16
verses	16
are	16
those	16
which	16
you	16
have	16
now	16
in	16
hand,	16
and	16
which	16
your	16
father	16
tells	16
me	16
keep	16
you	16
somewhat	16
restless	16
and	16
absorbed?	16
If	16
it	16
be	16
some	16
gloss,	16
I	16
know	16
something	16
about	16
glosses,	16
and	16
I	16
should	16
like	16
to	16
hear	16
them;	16
and	16
if	16
they	16
are	16
for	16
a	16
poetical	16
tournament,	16
contrive	16
to	16
carry	16
off	16
the	16
second	16
prize;	16
for	16
the	16
first	16
always	16
goes	16
by	16
favour	16
or	16
personal	16
standing,	16
the	16
second	16
by	16
simple	16
justice;	16
and	16
so	16
the	16
third	16
comes	16
to	16
be	16
the	16
second,	16
and	16
the	16
first,	16
reckoning	16
in	16
this	16
way,	16
will	16
be	16
third,	16
in	16
the	16
same	16
way	16
as	16
licentiate	16
degrees	16
are	16
conferred	16
at	16
the	16
universities;	16
but,	16
for	16
all	16
that,	16
the	16
title	16
of	16
first	16
is	16
a	16
great	16
distinction.”	16
“So	16
far,”	16
said	16
Don	16
Lorenzo	16
to	16
himself,	16
“I	16
should	16
not	16
take	16
you	16
to	16
be	16
a	16
madman;	16
but	16
let	16
us	16
go	16
on.”	16
So	16
he	16
said	16
to	16
him,	16
“Your	16
worship	16
has	16
apparently	16
attended	16
the	16
schools;	16
what	16
sciences	16
have	16
you	16
studied?”	16
“That	16
of	16
knight-errantry,”	16
said	16
Don	16
Quixote,	16
“which	16
is	16
as	16
good	16
as	16
that	16
of	16
poetry,	16
and	16
even	16
a	16
finger	16
or	16
two	16
above	16
it.”	16
“I	16
do	16
not	16
know	16
what	16
science	16
that	16
is,”	16
said	16
Don	16
Lorenzo,	16
“and	16
until	16
now	16
I	16
have	16
never	16
heard	16
of	16
it.”	16
“It	16
is	16
a	16
science,”	16
said	16
Don	16
Quixote,	16
“that	16
comprehends	16
in	16
itself	16
all	16
or	16
most	16
of	16
the	16
sciences	16
in	16
the	16
world,	16
for	16
he	16
who	16
professes	16
it	16
must	16
be	16
a	16
jurist,	16
and	16
must	16
know	16
the	16
rules	16
of	16
justice,	16
distributive	16
and	16
equitable,	16
so	16
as	16
to	16
give	16
to	16
each	16
one	16
what	16
belongs	16
to	16
him	16
and	16
is	16
due	16
to	16
him.	16
He	16
must	16
be	16
a	16
theologian,	16
so	16
as	16
to	16
be	16
able	16
to	16
give	16
a	16
clear	16
and	16
distinctive	16
reason	16
for	16
the	16
Christian	16
faith	16
he	16
professes,	16
wherever	16
it	16
may	16
be	16
asked	16
of	16
him.	16
He	16
must	16
be	16
a	16
physician,	16
and	16
above	16
all	16
a	16
herbalist,	16
so	16
as	16
in	16
wastes	16
and	16
solitudes	16
to	16
know	16
the	16
herbs	16
that	16
have	16
the	16
property	16
of	16
healing	16
wounds,	16
for	16
a	16
knight-errant	16
must	16
not	16
go	16
looking	16
for	16
someone	16
to	16
cure	16
him	16
at	16
every	16
step.	16
He	16
must	16
be	16
an	16
astronomer,	16
so	16
as	16
to	16
know	16
by	16
the	16
stars	16
how	16
many	16
hours	16
of	16
the	16
night	16
have	16
passed,	16
and	16
what	16
clime	16
and	16
quarter	16
of	16
the	16
world	16
he	16
is	16
in.	16
He	16
must	16
know	16
mathematics,	16
for	16
at	16
every	16
turn	16
some	16
occasion	16
for	16
them	16
will	16
present	16
itself	16
to	16
him;	16
and,	16
putting	16
it	16
aside	16
that	16
he	16
must	16
be	16
adorned	16
with	16
all	16
the	16
virtues,	16
cardinal	16
and	16
theological,	16
to	16
come	16
down	16
to	16
minor	16
particulars,	16
he	16
must,	16
I	16
say,	16
be	16
able	16
to	16
swim	16
as	16
well	16
as	16
Nicholas	16
or	16
Nicolao	16
the	16
Fish	16
could,	16
as	16
the	16
story	16
goes;	16
he	16
must	16
know	16
how	16
to	16
shoe	16
a	16
horse,	16
and	16
repair	16
his	16
saddle	16
and	16
bridle;	16
and,	16
to	16
return	16
to	16
higher	16
matters,	16
he	16
must	16
be	16
faithful	16
to	16
God	16
and	16
to	16
his	16
lady;	16
he	16
must	16
be	16
pure	16
in	16
thought,	16
decorous	16
in	16
words,	16
generous	16
in	16
works,	16
valiant	16
in	16
deeds,	16
patient	16
in	16
suffering,	16
compassionate	16
towards	16
the	16
needy,	16
and,	16
lastly,	16
an	16
upholder	16
of	16
the	16
truth	16
though	16
its	16
defence	16
should	16
cost	16
him	16
his	16
life.	16
Of	16
all	16
these	16
qualities,	16
great	16
and	16
small,	16
is	16
a	16
true	16
knight-errant	16
made	16
up;	16
judge	16
then,	16
Señor	16
Don	16
Lorenzo,	16
whether	16
it	16
be	16
a	16
contemptible	16
science	16
which	16
the	16
knight	16
who	16
studies	16
and	16
professes	16
it	16
has	16
to	16
learn,	16
and	16
whether	16
it	16
may	16
not	16
compare	16
with	16
the	16
very	16
loftiest	16
that	16
are	16
taught	16
in	16
the	16
schools.”	16
“If	16
that	16
be	16
so,”	16
replied	16
Don	16
Lorenzo,	16
“this	16
science,	16
I	16
protest,	16
surpasses	16
all.”	16
“How,	16
if	16
that	16
be	16
so?”	16
said	16
Don	16
Quixote.	16
“What	16
I	16
mean	16
to	16
say,”	16
said	16
Don	16
Lorenzo,	16
“is,	16
that	16
I	16
doubt	16
whether	16
there	16
are	16
now,	16
or	16
ever	16
were,	16
any	16
knights-errant,	16
and	16
adorned	16
with	16
such	16
virtues.”	16
“Many	16
a	16
time,”	16
replied	16
Don	16
Quixote,	16
“have	16
I	16
said	16
what	16
I	16
now	16
say	16
once	16
more,	16
that	16
the	16
majority	16
of	16
the	16
world	16
are	16
of	16
opinion	16
that	16
there	16
never	16
were	16
any	16
knights-errant	16
in	16
it;	16
and	16
as	16
it	16
is	16
my	16
opinion	16
that,	16
unless	16
heaven	16
by	16
some	16
miracle	16
brings	16
home	16
to	16
them	16
the	16
truth	16
that	16
there	16
were	16
and	16
are,	16
all	16
the	16
pains	16
one	16
takes	16
will	16
be	16
in	16
vain	16
(as	16
experience	16
has	16
often	16
proved	16
to	16
me),	16
I	16
will	16
not	16
now	16
stop	16
to	16
disabuse	16
you	16
of	16
the	16
error	16
you	16
share	16
with	16
the	16
multitude.	16
All	16
I	16
shall	16
do	16
is	16
to	16
pray	16
to	16
heaven	16
to	16
deliver	16
you	16
from	16
it,	16
and	16
show	16
you	16
how	16
beneficial	16
and	16
necessary	16
knights-errant	16
were	16
in	16
days	16
of	16
yore,	16
and	16
how	16
useful	16
they	16
would	16
be	16
in	16
these	16
days	16
were	16
they	16
but	16
in	16
vogue;	16
but	16
now,	16
for	16
the	16
sins	16
of	16
the	16
people,	16
sloth	16
and	16
indolence,	16
gluttony	16
and	16
luxury	16
are	16
triumphant.”	16
“Our	16
guest	16
has	16
broken	16
out	16
on	16
our	16
hands,”	16
said	16
Don	16
Lorenzo	16
to	16
himself	16
at	16
this	16
point;	16
“but,	16
for	16
all	16
that,	16
he	16
is	16
a	16
glorious	16
madman,	16
and	16
I	16
should	16
be	16
a	16
dull	16
blockhead	16
to	16
doubt	16
it.”	16
Here,	16
being	16
summoned	16
to	16
dinner,	16
they	16
brought	16
their	16
colloquy	16
to	16
a	16
close.	16
Don	16
Diego	16
asked	16
his	16
son	16
what	16
he	16
had	16
been	16
able	16
to	16
make	16
out	16
as	16
to	16
the	16
wits	16
of	16
their	16
guest.	16
To	16
which	16
he	16
replied,	16
“All	16
the	16
doctors	16
and	16
clever	16
scribes	16
in	16
the	16
world	16
will	16
not	16
make	16
sense	16
of	16
the	16
scrawl	16
of	16
his	16
madness;	16
he	16
is	16
a	16
madman	16
full	16
of	16
streaks,	16
full	16
of	16
lucid	16
intervals.”	16
They	16
went	16
in	16
to	16
dinner,	16
and	16
the	16
repast	16
was	16
such	16
as	16
Don	16
Diego	16
said	16
on	16
the	16
road	16
he	16
was	16
in	16
the	16
habit	16
of	16
giving	16
to	16
his	16
guests,	16
neat,	16
plentiful,	16
and	16
tasty;	16
but	16
what	16
pleased	16
Don	16
Quixote	16
most	16
was	16
the	16
marvellous	16
silence	16
that	16
reigned	16
throughout	16
the	16
house,	16
for	16
it	16
was	16
like	16
a	16
Carthusian	16
monastery.	16
When	16
the	16
cloth	16
had	16
been	16
removed,	16
grace	16
said	16
and	16
their	16
hands	16
washed,	16
Don	16
Quixote	16
earnestly	16
pressed	16
Don	16
Lorenzo	16
to	16
repeat	16
to	16
him	16
his	16
verses	16
for	16
the	16
poetical	16
tournament,	16
to	16
which	16
he	16
replied,	16
“Not	16
to	16
be	16
like	16
those	16
poets	16
who,	16
when	16
they	16
are	16
asked	16
to	16
recite	16
their	16
verses,	16
refuse,	16
and	16
when	16
they	16
are	16
not	16
asked	16
for	16
them	16
vomit	16
them	16
up,	16
I	16
will	16
repeat	16
my	16
gloss,	16
for	16
which	16
I	16
do	16
not	16
expect	16
any	16
prize,	16
having	16
composed	16
it	16
merely	16
as	16
an	16
exercise	16
of	16
ingenuity.”	16
“A	16
discerning	16
friend	16
of	16
mine,”	16
said	16
Don	16
Quixote,	16
“was	16
of	16
opinion	16
that	16
no	16
one	16
ought	16
to	16
waste	16
labour	16
in	16
glossing	16
verses;	16
and	16
the	16
reason	16
he	16
gave	16
was	16
that	16
the	16
gloss	16
can	16
never	16
come	16
up	16
to	16
the	16
text,	16
and	16
that	16
often	16
or	16
most	16
frequently	16
it	16
wanders	16
away	16
from	16
the	16
meaning	16
and	16
purpose	16
aimed	16
at	16
in	16
the	16
glossed	16
lines;	16
and	16
besides,	16
that	16
the	16
laws	16
of	16
the	16
gloss	16
were	16
too	16
strict,	16
as	16
they	16
did	16
not	16
allow	16
interrogations,	16
nor	16
‘said	16
he,’	16
nor	16
‘I	16
say,’	16
nor	16
turning	16
verbs	16
into	16
nouns,	16
or	16
altering	16
the	16
construction,	16
not	16
to	16
speak	16
of	16
other	16
restrictions	16
and	16
limitations	16
that	16
fetter	16
gloss-writers,	16
as	16
you	16
no	16
doubt	16
know.”	16
“Verily,	16
Señor	16
Don	16
Quixote,”	16
said	16
Don	16
Lorenzo,	16
“I	16
wish	16
I	16
could	16
catch	16
your	16
worship	16
tripping	16
at	16
a	16
stretch,	16
but	16
I	16
cannot,	16
for	16
you	16
slip	16
through	16
my	16
fingers	16
like	16
an	16
eel.”	16
“I	16
don’t	16
understand	16
what	16
you	16
say,	16
or	16
mean	16
by	16
slipping,”	16
said	16
Don	16
Quixote.	16
“I	16
will	16
explain	16
myself	16
another	16
time,”	16
said	16
Don	16
Lorenzo;	16
“for	16
the	16
present	16
pray	16
attend	16
to	16
the	16
glossed	16
verses	16
and	16
the	16
gloss,	16
which	16
run	16
thus:	16
Could	16
‘was’	16
become	16
an	16
‘is’	16
for	16
me,	16
Then	16
would	16
I	16
ask	16
no	16
more	16
than	16
this;	16
Or	16
could,	16
for	16
me,	16
the	16
time	16
that	16
is	16
Become	16
the	16
time	16
that	16
is	16
to	16
be!—	16
GLOSS	16
Dame	16
Fortune	16
once	16
upon	16
a	16
day	16
To	16
me	16
was	16
bountiful	16
and	16
kind;	16
But	16
all	16
things	16
change;	16
she	16
changed	16
her	16
mind,	16
And	16
what	16
she	16
gave	16
she	16
took	16
away.	16
O	16
Fortune,	16
long	16
I’ve	16
sued	16
to	16
thee;	16
The	16
gifts	16
thou	16
gavest	16
me	16
restore,	16
For,	16
trust	16
me,	16
I	16
would	16
ask	16
no	16
more,	16
Could	16
‘was’	16
become	16
an	16
‘is’	16
for	16
me.	16
No	16
other	16
prize	16
I	16
seek	16
to	16
gain,	16
No	16
triumph,	16
glory,	16
or	16
success,	16
Only	16
the	16
long-lost	16
happiness,	16
The	16
memory	16
whereof	16
is	16
pain.	16
One	16
taste,	16
methinks,	16
of	16
bygone	16
bliss	16
The	16
heart-consuming	16
fire	16
might	16
stay;	16
And,	16
so	16
it	16
come	16
without	16
delay,	16
Then	16
would	16
I	16
ask	16
no	16
more	16
than	16
this.	16
I	16
ask	16
what	16
cannot	16
be,	16
alas!	16
That	16
time	16
should	16
ever	16
be,	16
and	16
then	16
Come	16
back	16
to	16
us,	16
and	16
be	16
again,	16
No	16
power	16
on	16
earth	16
can	16
bring	16
to	16
pass;	16
For	16
fleet	16
of	16
foot	16
is	16
he,	16
I	16
wis,	16
And	16
idly,	16
therefore,	16
do	16
we	16
pray	16
That	16
what	16
for	16
aye	16
hath	16
left	16
us	16
may	16
Become	16
for	16
us	16
the	16
time	16
that	16
is.	16
Perplexed,	16
uncertain,	16
to	16
remain	16
’Twixt	16
hope	16
and	16
fear,	16
is	16
death,	16
not	16
life;	16
’Twere	16
better,	16
sure,	16
to	16
end	16
the	16
strife,	16
And	16
dying,	16
seek	16
release	16
from	16
pain.	16
And	16
yet,	16
thought	16
were	16
the	16
best	16
for	16
me.	16
Anon	16
the	16
thought	16
aside	16
I	16
fling,	16
And	16
to	16
the	16
present	16
fondly	16
cling,	16
And	16
dread	16
the	16
time	16
that	16
is	16
to	16
be.”	16
When	16
Don	16
Lorenzo	16
had	16
finished	16
reciting	16
his	16
gloss,	16
Don	16
Quixote	16
stood	16
up,	16
and	16
in	16
a	16
loud	16
voice,	16
almost	16
a	16
shout,	16
exclaimed	16
as	16
he	16
grasped	16
Don	16
Lorenzo’s	16
right	16
hand	16
in	16
his,	16
“By	16
the	16
highest	16
heavens,	16
noble	16
youth,	16
but	16
you	16
are	16
the	16
best	16
poet	16
on	16
earth,	16
and	16
deserve	16
to	16
be	16
crowned	16
with	16
laurel,	16
not	16
by	16
Cyprus	16
or	16
by	16
Gaeta—as	16
a	16
certain	16
poet,	16
God	16
forgive	16
him,	16
said—but	16
by	16
the	16
Academies	16
of	16
Athens,	16
if	16
they	16
still	16
flourished,	16
and	16
by	16
those	16
that	16
flourish	16
now,	16
Paris,	16
Bologna,	16
Salamanca.	16
Heaven	16
grant	16
that	16
the	16
judges	16
who	16
rob	16
you	16
of	16
the	16
first	16
prize—that	16
Phœbus	16
may	16
pierce	16
them	16
with	16
his	16
arrows,	16
and	16
the	16
Muses	16
never	16
cross	16
the	16
thresholds	16
of	16
their	16
doors.	16
Repeat	16
me	16
some	16
of	16
your	16
long-measure	16
verses,	16
señor,	16
if	16
you	16
will	16
be	16
so	16
good,	16
for	16
I	16
want	16
thoroughly	16
to	16
feel	16
the	16
pulse	16
of	16
your	16
rare	16
genius.”	16
Is	16
there	16
any	16
need	16
to	16
say	16
that	16
Don	16
Lorenzo	16
enjoyed	16
hearing	16
himself	16
praised	16
by	16
Don	16
Quixote,	16
albeit	16
he	16
looked	16
upon	16
him	16
as	16
a	16
madman?	16
power	16
of	16
flattery,	16
how	16
far-reaching	16
art	16
thou,	16
and	16
how	16
wide	16
are	16
the	16
bounds	16
of	16
thy	16
pleasant	16
jurisdiction!	16
Don	16
Lorenzo	16
gave	16
a	16
proof	16
of	16
it,	16
for	16
he	16
complied	16
with	16
Don	16
Quixote’s	16
request	16
and	16
entreaty,	16
and	16
repeated	16
to	16
him	16
this	16
sonnet	16
on	16
the	16
fable	16
or	16
story	16
of	16
Pyramus	16
and	16
Thisbe.	16
SONNET	16
The	16
lovely	16
maid,	16
she	16
pierces	16
now	16
the	16
wall;	16
Heart-pierced	16
by	16
her	16
young	16
Pyramus	16
doth	16
lie;	16
And	16
Love	16
spreads	16
wing	16
from	16
Cyprus	16
isle	16
to	16
fly,	16
A	16
chink	16
to	16
view	16
so	16
wondrous	16
great	16
and	16
small.	16
There	16
silence	16
speaketh,	16
for	16
no	16
voice	16
at	16
all	16
Can	16
pass	16
so	16
strait	16
a	16
strait;	16
but	16
love	16
will	16
ply	16
Where	16
to	16
all	16
other	16
power	16
’twere	16
vain	16
to	16
try;	16
For	16
love	16
will	16
find	16
a	16
way	16
whate’er	16
befall.	16
Impatient	16
of	16
delay,	16
with	16
reckless	16
pace	16
The	16
rash	16
maid	16
wins	16
the	16
fatal	16
spot	16
where	16
she	16
Sinks	16
not	16
in	16
lover’s	16
arms	16
but	16
death’s	16
embrace.	16
So	16
runs	16
the	16
strange	16
tale,	16
how	16
the	16
lovers	16
twain	16
One	16
sword,	16
one	16
sepulchre,	16
one	16
memory,	16
Slays,	16
and	16
entombs,	16
and	16
brings	16
to	16
life	16
again.	16
“Blessed	16
be	16
God,”	16
said	16
Don	16
Quixote	16
when	16
he	16
had	16
heard	16
Don	16
Lorenzo’s	16
sonnet,	16
“that	16
among	16
the	16
hosts	16
there	16
are	16
of	16
irritable	16
poets	16
I	16
have	16
found	16
one	16
consummate	16
one,	16
which,	16
señor,	16
the	16
art	16
of	16
this	16
sonnet	16
proves	16
to	16
me	16
that	16
you	16
are!”	16
For	16
four	16
days	16
was	16
Don	16
Quixote	16
most	16
sumptuously	16
entertained	16
in	16
Don	16
Diego’s	16
house,	16
at	16
the	16
end	16
of	16
which	16
time	16
he	16
asked	16
his	16
permission	16
to	16
depart,	16
telling	16
him	16
he	16
thanked	16
him	16
for	16
the	16
kindness	16
and	16
hospitality	16
he	16
had	16
received	16
in	16
his	16
house,	16
but	16
that,	16
as	16
it	16
did	16
not	16
become	16
knights-errant	16
to	16
give	16
themselves	16
up	16
for	16
long	16
to	16
idleness	16
and	16
luxury,	16
he	16
was	16
anxious	16
to	16
fulfill	16
the	16
duties	16
of	16
his	16
calling	16
in	16
seeking	16
adventures,	16
of	16
which	16
he	16
was	16
informed	16
there	16
was	16
an	16
abundance	16
in	16
that	16
neighbourhood,	16
where	16
he	16
hoped	16
to	16
employ	16
his	16
time	16
until	16
the	16
day	16
came	16
round	16
for	16
the	16
jousts	16
at	16
Saragossa,	16
for	16
that	16
was	16
his	16
proper	16
destination;	16
and	16
that,	16
first	16
of	16
all,	16
he	16
meant	16
to	16
enter	16
the	16
cave	16
of	16
Montesinos,	16
of	16
which	16
so	16
many	16
marvellous	16
things	16
were	16
reported	16
all	16
through	16
the	16
country,	16
and	16
at	16
the	16
same	16
time	16
to	16
investigate	16
and	16
explore	16
the	16
origin	16
and	16
true	16
source	16
of	16
the	16
seven	16
lakes	16
commonly	16
called	16
the	16
lakes	16
of	16
Ruidera.	16
Don	16
Diego	16
and	16
his	16
son	16
commended	16
his	16
laudable	16
resolution,	16
and	16
bade	16
him	16
furnish	16
himself	16
with	16
all	16
he	16
wanted	16
from	16
their	16
house	16
and	16
belongings,	16
as	16
they	16
would	16
most	16
gladly	16
be	16
of	16
service	16
to	16
him;	16
which,	16
indeed,	16
his	16
personal	16
worth	16
and	16
his	16
honourable	16
profession	16
made	16
incumbent	16
upon	16
them.	16
The	16
day	16
of	16
his	16
departure	16
came	16
at	16
length,	16
as	16
welcome	16
to	16
Don	16
Quixote	16
as	16
it	16
was	16
sad	16
and	16
sorrowful	16
to	16
Sancho	16
Panza,	16
who	16
was	16
very	16
well	16
satisfied	16
with	16
the	16
abundance	16
of	16
Don	16
Diego’s	16
house,	16
and	16
objected	16
to	16
return	16
to	16
the	16
starvation	16
of	16
the	16
woods	16
and	16
wilds	16
and	16
the	16
short-commons	16
of	16
his	16
ill-stocked	16
alforjas;	16
these,	16
however,	16
he	16
filled	16
and	16
packed	16
with	16
what	16
he	16
considered	16
needful.	16
On	16
taking	16
leave,	16
Don	16
Quixote	16
said	16
to	16
Don	16
Lorenzo,	16
“I	16
know	16
not	16
whether	16
I	16
have	16
told	16
you	16
already,	16
but	16
if	16
I	16
have	16
I	16
tell	16
you	16
once	16
more,	16
that	16
if	16
you	16
wish	16
to	16
spare	16
yourself	16
fatigue	16
and	16
toil	16
in	16
reaching	16
the	16
inaccessible	16
summit	16
of	16
the	16
temple	16
of	16
fame,	16
you	16
have	16
nothing	16
to	16
do	16
but	16
to	16
turn	16
aside	16
out	16
of	16
the	16
somewhat	16
narrow	16
path	16
of	16
poetry	16
and	16
take	16
the	16
still	16
narrower	16
one	16
of	16
knight-errantry,	16
wide	16
enough,	16
however,	16
to	16
make	16
you	16
an	16
emperor	16
in	16
the	16
twinkling	16
of	16
an	16
eye.”	16
In	16
this	16
speech	16
Don	16
Quixote	16
wound	16
up	16
the	16
evidence	16
of	16
his	16
madness,	16
but	16
still	16
better	16
in	16
what	16
he	16
added	16
when	16
he	16
said,	16
“God	16
knows,	16
I	16
would	16
gladly	16
take	16
Don	16
Lorenzo	16
with	16
me	16
to	16
teach	16
him	16
how	16
to	16
spare	16
the	16
humble,	16
and	16
trample	16
the	16
proud	16
under	16
foot,	16
virtues	16
that	16
are	16
part	16
and	16
parcel	16
of	16
the	16
profession	16
I	16
belong	16
to;	16
but	16
since	16
his	16
tender	16
age	16
does	16
not	16
allow	16
of	16
it,	16
nor	16
his	16
praiseworthy	16
pursuits	16
permit	16
it,	16
I	16
will	16
simply	16
content	16
myself	16
with	16
impressing	16
it	16
upon	16
your	16
worship	16
that	16
you	16
will	16
become	16
famous	16
as	16
a	16
poet	16
if	16
you	16
are	16
guided	16
by	16
the	16
opinion	16
of	16
others	16
rather	16
than	16
by	16
your	16
own;	16
because	16
no	16
fathers	16
or	16
mothers	16
ever	16
think	16
their	16
own	16
children	16
ill-favoured,	16
and	16
this	16
sort	16
of	16
deception	16
prevails	16
still	16
more	16
strongly	16
in	16
the	16
case	16
of	16
the	16
children	16
of	16
the	16
brain.”	16
Both	16
father	16
and	16
son	16
were	16
amazed	16
afresh	16
at	16
the	16
strange	16
medley	16
Don	16
Quixote	16
talked,	16
at	16
one	16
moment	16
sense,	16
at	16
another	16
nonsense,	16
and	16
at	16
the	16
pertinacity	16
and	16
persistence	16
he	16
displayed	16
in	16
going	16
through	16
thick	16
and	16
thin	16
in	16
quest	16
of	16
his	16
unlucky	16
adventures,	16
which	16
he	16
made	16
the	16
end	16
and	16
aim	16
of	16
his	16
desires.	16
There	16
was	16
a	16
renewal	16
of	16
offers	16
of	16
service	16
and	16
civilities,	16
and	16
then,	16
with	16
the	16
gracious	16
permission	16
of	16
the	16
lady	16
of	16
the	16
castle,	16
they	16
took	16
their	16
departure,	16
Don	16
Quixote	16
on	16
Rocinante,	16
and	16
Sancho	16
on	16
Dapple.	16

Don	16
Quixote	16
had	16
gone	16
but	16
a	16
short	16
distance	16
beyond	16
Don	16
Diego’s	16
village,	16
when	16
he	16
fell	16
in	16
with	16
a	16
couple	16
of	16
either	16
priests	16
or	16
students,	16
and	16
a	16
couple	16
of	16
peasants,	16
mounted	16
on	16
four	16
beasts	16
of	16
the	16
ass	16
kind.	16
One	16
of	16
the	16
students	16
carried,	16
wrapped	16
up	16
in	16
a	16
piece	16
of	16
green	16
buckram	16
by	16
way	16
of	16
a	16
portmanteau,	16
what	16
seemed	16
to	16
be	16
a	16
little	16
linen	16
and	16
a	16
couple	16
of	16
pairs	16
of	16
ribbed	16
stockings;	16
the	16
other	16
carried	16
nothing	16
but	16
a	16
pair	16
of	16
new	16
fencing-foils	16
with	16
buttons.	16
The	16
peasants	16
carried	16
divers	16
articles	16
that	16
showed	16
they	16
were	16
on	16
their	16
way	16
from	16
some	16
large	16
town	16
where	16
they	16
had	16
bought	16
them,	16
and	16
were	16
taking	16
them	16
home	16
to	16
their	16
village;	16
and	16
both	16
students	16
and	16
peasants	16
were	16
struck	16
with	16
the	16
same	16
amazement	16
that	16
everybody	16
felt	16
who	16
saw	16
Don	16
Quixote	16
for	16
the	16
first	16
time,	16
and	16
were	16
dying	16
to	16
know	16
who	16
this	16
man,	16
so	16
different	16
from	16
ordinary	16
men,	16
could	16
be.	16
Don	16
Quixote	16
saluted	16
them,	16
and	16
after	16
ascertaining	16
that	16
their	16
road	16
was	16
the	16
same	16
as	16
his,	16
made	16
them	16
an	16
offer	16
of	16
his	16
company,	16
and	16
begged	16
them	16
to	16
slacken	16
their	16
pace,	16
as	16
their	16
young	16
asses	16
travelled	16
faster	16
than	16
his	16
horse;	16
and	16
then,	16
to	16
gratify	16
them,	16
he	16
told	16
them	16
in	16
a	16
few	16
words	16
who	16
he	16
was	16
and	16
the	16
calling	16
and	16
profession	16
he	16
followed,	16
which	16
was	16
that	16
of	16
a	16
knight-errant	16
seeking	16
adventures	16
in	16
all	16
parts	16
of	16
the	16
world.	16
He	16
informed	16
them	16
that	16
his	16
own	16
name	16
was	16
Don	16
Quixote	16
of	16
La	16
Mancha,	16
and	16
that	16
he	16
was	16
called,	16
by	16
way	16
of	16
surname,	16
the	16
Knight	16
of	16
the	16
Lions.	16
All	16
this	16
was	16
Greek	16
or	16
gibberish	16
to	16
the	16
peasants,	16
but	16
not	16
so	16
to	16
the	16
students,	16
who	16
very	16
soon	16
perceived	16
the	16
crack	16
in	16
Don	16
Quixote’s	16
pate;	16
for	16
all	16
that,	16
however,	16
they	16
regarded	16
him	16
with	16
admiration	16
and	16
respect,	16
and	16
one	16
of	16
them	16
said	16
to	16
him,	16
“If	16
you,	16
sir	16
knight,	16
have	16
no	16
fixed	16
road,	16
as	16
it	16
is	16
the	16
way	16
with	16
those	16
who	16
seek	16
adventures	16
not	16
to	16
have	16
any,	16
let	16
your	16
worship	16
come	16
with	16
us;	16
you	16
will	16
see	16
one	16
of	16
the	16
finest	16
and	16
richest	16
weddings	16
that	16
up	16
to	16
this	16
day	16
have	16
ever	16
been	16
celebrated	16
in	16
La	16
Mancha,	16
or	16
for	16
many	16
a	16
league	16
round.”	16
Don	16
Quixote	16
asked	16
him	16
if	16
it	16
was	16
some	16
prince’s,	16
that	16
he	16
spoke	16
of	16
it	16
in	16
this	16
way.	16
“Not	16
at	16
all,”	16
said	16
the	16
student;	16
“it	16
is	16
the	16
wedding	16
of	16
a	16
farmer	16
and	16
a	16
farmer’s	16
daughter,	16
he	16
the	16
richest	16
in	16
all	16
this	16
country,	16
and	16
she	16
the	16
fairest	16
mortal	16
ever	16
set	16
eyes	16
on.	16
The	16
display	16
with	16
which	16
it	16
is	16
to	16
be	16
attended	16
will	16
be	16
something	16
rare	16
and	16
out	16
of	16
the	16
common,	16
for	16
it	16
will	16
be	16
celebrated	16
in	16
a	16
meadow	16
adjoining	16
the	16
town	16
of	16
the	16
bride,	16
who	16
is	16
called,	16
_par	16
excellence_,	16
Quiteria	16
the	16
fair,	16
as	16
the	16
bridegroom	16
is	16
called	16
Camacho	16
the	16
rich.	16
She	16
is	16
eighteen,	16
and	16
he	16
twenty-two,	16
and	16
they	16
are	16
fairly	16
matched,	16
though	16
some	16
knowing	16
ones,	16
who	16
have	16
all	16
the	16
pedigrees	16
in	16
the	16
world	16
by	16
heart,	16
will	16
have	16
it	16
that	16
the	16
family	16
of	16
the	16
fair	16
Quiteria	16
is	16
better	16
than	16
Camacho’s;	16
but	16
no	16
one	16
minds	16
that	16
now-a-days,	16
for	16
wealth	16
can	16
solder	16
a	16
great	16
many	16
flaws.	16
At	16
any	16
rate,	16
Camacho	16
is	16
free-handed,	16
and	16
it	16
is	16
his	16
fancy	16
to	16
screen	16
the	16
whole	16
meadow	16
with	16
boughs	16
and	16
cover	16
it	16
in	16
overhead,	16
so	16
that	16
the	16
sun	16
will	16
have	16
hard	16
work	16
if	16
he	16
tries	16
to	16
get	16
in	16
to	16
reach	16
the	16
grass	16
that	16
covers	16
the	16
soil.	16
He	16
has	16
provided	16
dancers	16
too,	16
not	16
only	16
sword	16
but	16
also	16
bell-dancers,	16
for	16
in	16
his	16
own	16
town	16
there	16
are	16
those	16
who	16
ring	16
the	16
changes	16
and	16
jingle	16
the	16
bells	16
to	16
perfection;	16
of	16
shoe-dancers	16
I	16
say	16
nothing,	16
for	16
of	16
them	16
he	16
has	16
engaged	16
a	16
host.	16
But	16
none	16
of	16
these	16
things,	16
nor	16
of	16
the	16
many	16
others	16
I	16
have	16
omitted	16
to	16
mention,	16
will	16
do	16
more	16
to	16
make	16
this	16
a	16
memorable	16
wedding	16
than	16
the	16
part	16
which	16
I	16
suspect	16
the	16
despairing	16
Basilio	16
will	16
play	16
in	16
it.	16
This	16
Basilio	16
is	16
a	16
youth	16
of	16
the	16
same	16
village	16
as	16
Quiteria,	16
and	16
he	16
lived	16
in	16
the	16
house	16
next	16
door	16
to	16
that	16
of	16
her	16
parents,	16
of	16
which	16
circumstance	16
Love	16
took	16
advantage	16
to	16
reproduce	16
to	16
the	16
word	16
the	16
long-forgotten	16
loves	16
of	16
Pyramus	16
and	16
Thisbe;	16
for	16
Basilio	16
loved	16
Quiteria	16
from	16
his	16
earliest	16
years,	16
and	16
she	16
responded	16
to	16
his	16
passion	16
with	16
countless	16
modest	16
proofs	16
of	16
affection,	16
so	16
that	16
the	16
loves	16
of	16
the	16
two	16
children,	16
Basilio	16
and	16
Quiteria,	16
were	16
the	16
talk	16
and	16
the	16
amusement	16
of	16
the	16
town.	16
As	16
they	16
grew	16
up,	16
the	16
father	16
of	16
Quiteria	16
made	16
up	16
his	16
mind	16
to	16
refuse	16
Basilio	16
his	16
wonted	16
freedom	16
of	16
access	16
to	16
the	16
house,	16
and	16
to	16
relieve	16
himself	16
of	16
constant	16
doubts	16
and	16
suspicions,	16
he	16
arranged	16
a	16
match	16
for	16
his	16
daughter	16
with	16
the	16
rich	16
Camacho,	16
as	16
he	16
did	16
not	16
approve	16
of	16
marrying	16
her	16
to	16
Basilio,	16
who	16
had	16
not	16
so	16
large	16
a	16
share	16
of	16
the	16
gifts	16
of	16
fortune	16
as	16
of	16
nature;	16
for	16
if	16
the	16
truth	16
be	16
told	16
ungrudgingly,	16
he	16
is	16
the	16
most	16
agile	16
youth	16
we	16
know,	16
a	16
mighty	16
thrower	16
of	16
the	16
bar,	16
a	16
first-rate	16
wrestler,	16
and	16
a	16
great	16
ball-player;	16
he	16
runs	16
like	16
a	16
deer,	16
and	16
leaps	16
better	16
than	16
a	16
goat,	16
bowls	16
over	16
the	16
nine-pins	16
as	16
if	16
by	16
magic,	16
sings	16
like	16
a	16
lark,	16
plays	16
the	16
guitar	16
so	16
as	16
to	16
make	16
it	16
speak,	16
and,	16
above	16
all,	16
handles	16
a	16
sword	16
as	16
well	16
as	16
the	16
best.”	16
“For	16
that	16
excellence	16
alone,”	16
said	16
Don	16
Quixote	16
at	16
this,	16
“the	16
youth	16
deserves	16
to	16
marry,	16
not	16
merely	16
the	16
fair	16
Quiteria,	16
but	16
Queen	16
Guinevere	16
herself,	16
were	16
she	16
alive	16
now,	16
in	16
spite	16
of	16
Launcelot	16
and	16
all	16
who	16
would	16
try	16
to	16
prevent	16
it.”	16
“Say	16
that	16
to	16
my	16
wife,”	16
said	16
Sancho,	16
who	16
had	16
until	16
now	16
listened	16
in	16
silence,	16
“for	16
she	16
won’t	16
hear	16
of	16
anything	16
but	16
each	16
one	16
marrying	16
his	16
equal,	16
holding	16
with	16
the	16
proverb	16
‘each	16
ewe	16
to	16
her	16
like.’	16
What	16
I	16
would	16
like	16
is	16
that	16
this	16
good	16
Basilio	16
(for	16
I	16
am	16
beginning	16
to	16
take	16
a	16
fancy	16
to	16
him	16
already)	16
should	16
marry	16
this	16
lady	16
Quiteria;	16
and	16
a	16
blessing	16
and	16
good	16
luck—I	16
meant	16
to	16
say	16
the	16
opposite—on	16
people	16
who	16
would	16
prevent	16
those	16
who	16
love	16
one	16
another	16
from	16
marrying.”	16
“If	16
all	16
those	16
who	16
love	16
one	16
another	16
were	16
to	16
marry,”	16
said	16
Don	16
Quixote,	16
“it	16
would	16
deprive	16
parents	16
of	16
the	16
right	16
to	16
choose,	16
and	16
marry	16
their	16
children	16
to	16
the	16
proper	16
person	16
and	16
at	16
the	16
proper	16
time;	16
and	16
if	16
it	16
was	16
left	16
to	16
daughters	16
to	16
choose	16
husbands	16
as	16
they	16
pleased,	16
one	16
would	16
be	16
for	16
choosing	16
her	16
father’s	16
servant,	16
and	16
another,	16
someone	16
she	16
has	16
seen	16
passing	16
in	16
the	16
street	16
and	16
fancies	16
gallant	16
and	16
dashing,	16
though	16
he	16
may	16
be	16
a	16
drunken	16
bully;	16
for	16
love	16
and	16
fancy	16
easily	16
blind	16
the	16
eyes	16
of	16
the	16
judgment,	16
so	16
much	16
wanted	16
in	16
choosing	16
one’s	16
way	16
of	16
life;	16
and	16
the	16
matrimonial	16
choice	16
is	16
very	16
liable	16
to	16
error,	16
and	16
it	16
needs	16
great	16
caution	16
and	16
the	16
special	16
favour	16
of	16
heaven	16
to	16
make	16
it	16
a	16
good	16
one.	16
He	16
who	16
has	16
to	16
make	16
a	16
long	16
journey,	16
will,	16
if	16
he	16
is	16
wise,	16
look	16
out	16
for	16
some	16
trusty	16
and	16
pleasant	16
companion	16
to	16
accompany	16
him	16
before	16
he	16
sets	16
out.	16
Why,	16
then,	16
should	16
not	16
he	16
do	16
the	16
same	16
who	16
has	16
to	16
make	16
the	16
whole	16
journey	16
of	16
life	16
down	16
to	16
the	16
final	16
halting-place	16
of	16
death,	16
more	16
especially	16
when	16
the	16
companion	16
has	16
to	16
be	16
his	16
companion	16
in	16
bed,	16
at	16
board,	16
and	16
everywhere,	16
as	16
the	16
wife	16
is	16
to	16
her	16
husband?	16
The	16
companionship	16
of	16
one’s	16
wife	16
is	16
no	16
article	16
of	16
merchandise,	16
that,	16
after	16
it	16
has	16
been	16
bought,	16
may	16
be	16
returned,	16
or	16
bartered,	16
or	16
changed;	16
for	16
it	16
is	16
an	16
inseparable	16
accident	16
that	16
lasts	16
as	16
long	16
as	16
life	16
lasts;	16
it	16
is	16
a	16
noose	16
that,	16
once	16
you	16
put	16
it	16
round	16
your	16
neck,	16
turns	16
into	16
a	16
Gordian	16
knot,	16
which,	16
if	16
the	16
scythe	16
of	16
Death	16
does	16
not	16
cut	16
it,	16
there	16
is	16
no	16
untying.	16
I	16
could	16
say	16
a	16
great	16
deal	16
more	16
on	16
this	16
subject,	16
were	16
I	16
not	16
prevented	16
by	16
the	16
anxiety	16
I	16
feel	16
to	16
know	16
if	16
the	16
señor	16
licentiate	16
has	16
anything	16
more	16
to	16
tell	16
about	16
the	16
story	16
of	16
Basilio.”	16
To	16
this	16
the	16
student,	16
bachelor,	16
or,	16
as	16
Don	16
Quixote	16
called	16
him,	16
licentiate,	16
replied,	16
“I	16
have	16
nothing	16
whatever	16
to	16
say	16
further,	16
but	16
that	16
from	16
the	16
moment	16
Basilio	16
learned	16
that	16
the	16
fair	16
Quiteria	16
was	16
to	16
be	16
married	16
to	16
Camacho	16
the	16
rich,	16
he	16
has	16
never	16
been	16
seen	16
to	16
smile,	16
or	16
heard	16
to	16
utter	16
rational	16
word,	16
and	16
he	16
always	16
goes	16
about	16
moody	16
and	16
dejected,	16
talking	16
to	16
himself	16
in	16
a	16
way	16
that	16
shows	16
plainly	16
he	16
is	16
out	16
of	16
his	16
senses.	16
He	16
eats	16
little	16
and	16
sleeps	16
little,	16
and	16
all	16
he	16
eats	16
is	16
fruit,	16
and	16
when	16
he	16
sleeps,	16
if	16
he	16
sleeps	16
at	16
all,	16
it	16
is	16
in	16
the	16
field	16
on	16
the	16
hard	16
earth	16
like	16
a	16
brute	16
beast.	16
Sometimes	16
he	16
gazes	16
at	16
the	16
sky,	16
at	16
other	16
times	16
he	16
fixes	16
his	16
eyes	16
on	16
the	16
earth	16
in	16
such	16
an	16
abstracted	16
way	16
that	16
he	16
might	16
be	16
taken	16
for	16
a	16
clothed	16
statue,	16
with	16
its	16
drapery	16
stirred	16
by	16
the	16
wind.	16
In	16
short,	16
he	16
shows	16
such	16
signs	16
of	16
a	16
heart	16
crushed	16
by	16
suffering,	16
that	16
all	16
we	16
who	16
know	16
him	16
believe	16
that	16
when	16
to-morrow	16
the	16
fair	16
Quiteria	16
says	16
‘yes,’	16
it	16
will	16
be	16
his	16
sentence	16
of	16
death.”	16
“God	16
will	16
guide	16
it	16
better,”	16
said	16
Sancho,	16
“for	16
God	16
who	16
gives	16
the	16
wound	16
gives	16
the	16
salve;	16
nobody	16
knows	16
what	16
will	16
happen;	16
there	16
are	16
a	16
good	16
many	16
hours	16
between	16
this	16
and	16
to-morrow,	16
and	16
any	16
one	16
of	16
them,	16
or	16
any	16
moment,	16
the	16
house	16
may	16
fall;	16
I	16
have	16
seen	16
the	16
rain	16
coming	16
down	16
and	16
the	16
sun	16
shining	16
all	16
at	16
one	16
time;	16
many	16
a	16
one	16
goes	16
to	16
bed	16
in	16
good	16
health	16
who	16
can’t	16
stir	16
the	16
next	16
day.	16
And	16
tell	16
me,	16
is	16
there	16
anyone	16
who	16
can	16
boast	16
of	16
having	16
driven	16
a	16
nail	16
into	16
the	16
wheel	16
of	16
fortune?	16
No,	16
faith;	16
and	16
between	16
a	16
woman’s	16
‘yes’	16
and	16
‘no’	16
I	16
wouldn’t	16
venture	16
to	16
put	16
the	16
point	16
of	16
a	16
pin,	16
for	16
there	16
would	16
not	16
be	16
room	16
for	16
it;	16
if	16
you	16
tell	16
me	16
Quiteria	16
loves	16
Basilio	16
heart	16
and	16
soul,	16
then	16
I’ll	16
give	16
him	16
a	16
bag	16
of	16
good	16
luck;	16
for	16
love,	16
I	16
have	16
heard	16
say,	16
looks	16
through	16
spectacles	16
that	16
make	16
copper	16
seem	16
gold,	16
poverty	16
wealth,	16
and	16
bleary	16
eyes	16
pearls.”	16
“What	16
art	16
thou	16
driving	16
at,	16
Sancho?	16
curses	16
on	16
thee!”	16
said	16
Don	16
Quixote;	16
“for	16
when	16
thou	16
takest	16
to	16
stringing	16
proverbs	16
and	16
sayings	16
together,	16
no	16
one	16
can	16
understand	16
thee	16
but	16
Judas	16
himself,	16
and	16
I	16
wish	16
he	16
had	16
thee.	16
Tell	16
me,	16
thou	16
animal,	16
what	16
dost	16
thou	16
know	16
about	16
nails	16
or	16
wheels,	16
or	16
anything	16
else?”	16
“Oh,	16
if	16
you	16
don’t	16
understand	16
me,”	16
replied	16
Sancho,	16
“it	16
is	16
no	16
wonder	16
my	16
words	16
are	16
taken	16
for	16
nonsense;	16
but	16
no	16
matter;	16
I	16
understand	16
myself,	16
and	16
I	16
know	16
I	16
have	16
not	16
said	16
anything	16
very	16
foolish	16
in	16
what	16
I	16
have	16
said;	16
only	16
your	16
worship,	16
señor,	16
is	16
always	16
gravelling	16
at	16
everything	16
I	16
say,	16
nay,	16
everything	16
I	16
do.”	16
“Cavilling,	16
not	16
gravelling,”	16
said	16
Don	16
Quixote,	16
“thou	16
prevaricator	16
of	16
honest	16
language,	16
God	16
confound	16
thee!”	16
“Don’t	16
find	16
fault	16
with	16
me,	16
your	16
worship,”	16
returned	16
Sancho,	16
“for	16
you	16
know	16
I	16
have	16
not	16
been	16
bred	16
up	16
at	16
court	16
or	16
trained	16
at	16
Salamanca,	16
to	16
know	16
whether	16
I	16
am	16
adding	16
or	16
dropping	16
a	16
letter	16
or	16
so	16
in	16
my	16
words.	16
Why!	16
God	16
bless	16
me,	16
it’s	16
not	16
fair	16
to	16
force	16
a	16
Sayago-man	16
to	16
speak	16
like	16
a	16
Toledan;	16
maybe	16
there	16
are	16
Toledans	16
who	16
do	16
not	16
hit	16
it	16
off	16
when	16
it	16
comes	16
to	16
polished	16
talk.”	16
“That	16
is	16
true,”	16
said	16
the	16
licentiate,	16
“for	16
those	16
who	16
have	16
been	16
bred	16
up	16
in	16
the	16
Tanneries	16
and	16
the	16
Zocodover	16
cannot	16
talk	16
like	16
those	16
who	16
are	16
almost	16
all	16
day	16
pacing	16
the	16
cathedral	16
cloisters,	16
and	16
yet	16
they	16
are	16
all	16
Toledans.	16
Pure,	16
correct,	16
elegant	16
and	16
lucid	16
language	16
will	16
be	16
met	16
with	16
in	16
men	16
of	16
courtly	16
breeding	16
and	16
discrimination,	16
though	16
they	16
may	16
have	16
been	16
born	16
in	16
Majalahonda;	16
I	16
say	16
of	16
discrimination,	16
because	16
there	16
are	16
many	16
who	16
are	16
not	16
so,	16
and	16
discrimination	16
is	16
the	16
grammar	16
of	16
good	16
language,	16
if	16
it	16
be	16
accompanied	16
by	16
practice.	16
I,	16
sirs,	16
for	16
my	16
sins	16
have	16
studied	16
canon	16
law	16
at	16
Salamanca,	16
and	16
I	16
rather	16
pique	16
myself	16
on	16
expressing	16
my	16
meaning	16
in	16
clear,	16
plain,	16
and	16
intelligible	16
language.”	16
“If	16
you	16
did	16
not	16
pique	16
yourself	16
more	16
on	16
your	16
dexterity	16
with	16
those	16
foils	16
you	16
carry	16
than	16
on	16
dexterity	16
of	16
tongue,”	16
said	16
the	16
other	16
student,	16
“you	16
would	16
have	16
been	16
head	16
of	16
the	16
degrees,	16
where	16
you	16
are	16
now	16
tail.”	16
“Look	16
here,	16
bachelor	16
Corchuelo,”	16
returned	16
the	16
licentiate,	16
“you	16
have	16
the	16
most	16
mistaken	16
idea	16
in	16
the	16
world	16
about	16
skill	16
with	16
the	16
sword,	16
if	16
you	16
think	16
it	16
useless.”	16
“It	16
is	16
no	16
idea	16
on	16
my	16
part,	16
but	16
an	16
established	16
truth,”	16
replied	16
Corchuelo;	16
“and	16
if	16
you	16
wish	16
me	16
to	16
prove	16
it	16
to	16
you	16
by	16
experiment,	16
you	16
have	16
swords	16
there,	16
and	16
it	16
is	16
a	16
good	16
opportunity;	16
I	16
have	16
a	16
steady	16
hand	16
and	16
a	16
strong	16
arm,	16
and	16
these	16
joined	16
with	16
my	16
resolution,	16
which	16
is	16
not	16
small,	16
will	16
make	16
you	16
confess	16
that	16
I	16
am	16
not	16
mistaken.	16
Dismount	16
and	16
put	16
in	16
practice	16
your	16
positions	16
and	16
circles	16
and	16
angles	16
and	16
science,	16
for	16
I	16
hope	16
to	16
make	16
you	16
see	16
stars	16
at	16
noonday	16
with	16
my	16
rude	16
raw	16
swordsmanship,	16
in	16
which,	16
next	16
to	16
God,	16
I	16
place	16
my	16
trust	16
that	16
the	16
man	16
is	16
yet	16
to	16
be	16
born	16
who	16
will	16
make	16
me	16
turn	16
my	16
back,	16
and	16
that	16
there	16
is	16
not	16
one	16
in	16
the	16
world	16
I	16
will	16
not	16
compel	16
to	16
give	16
ground.”	16
“As	16
to	16
whether	16
you	16
turn	16
your	16
back	16
or	16
not,	16
I	16
do	16
not	16
concern	16
myself,”	16
replied	16
the	16
master	16
of	16
fence;	16
“though	16
it	16
might	16
be	16
that	16
your	16
grave	16
would	16
be	16
dug	16
on	16
the	16
spot	16
where	16
you	16
planted	16
your	16
foot	16
the	16
first	16
time;	16
I	16
mean	16
that	16
you	16
would	16
be	16
stretched	16
dead	16
there	16
for	16
despising	16
skill	16
with	16
the	16
sword.”	16
“We	16
shall	16
soon	16
see,”	16
replied	16
Corchuelo,	16
and	16
getting	16
off	16
his	16
ass	16
briskly,	16
he	16
drew	16
out	16
furiously	16
one	16
of	16
the	16
swords	16
the	16
licentiate	16
carried	16
on	16
his	16
beast.	16
“It	16
must	16
not	16
be	16
that	16
way,”	16
said	16
Don	16
Quixote	16
at	16
this	16
point;	16
“I	16
will	16
be	16
the	16
director	16
of	16
this	16
fencing	16
match,	16
and	16
judge	16
of	16
this	16
often	16
disputed	16
question;”	16
and	16
dismounting	16
from	16
Rocinante	16
and	16
grasping	16
his	16
lance,	16
he	16
planted	16
himself	16
in	16
the	16
middle	16
of	16
the	16
road,	16
just	16
as	16
the	16
licentiate,	16
with	16
an	16
easy,	16
graceful	16
bearing	16
and	16
step,	16
advanced	16
towards	16
Corchuelo,	16
who	16
came	16
on	16
against	16
him,	16
darting	16
fire	16
from	16
his	16
eyes,	16
as	16
the	16
saying	16
is.	16
The	16
other	16
two	16
of	16
the	16
company,	16
the	16
peasants,	16
without	16
dismounting	16
from	16
their	16
asses,	16
served	16
as	16
spectators	16
of	16
the	16
mortal	16
tragedy.	16
The	16
cuts,	16
thrusts,	16
down	16
strokes,	16
back	16
strokes	16
and	16
doubles,	16
that	16
Corchuelo	16
delivered	16
were	16
past	16
counting,	16
and	16
came	16
thicker	16
than	16
hops	16
or	16
hail.	16
He	16
attacked	16
like	16
an	16
angry	16
lion,	16
but	16
he	16
was	16
met	16
by	16
a	16
tap	16
on	16
the	16
mouth	16
from	16
the	16
button	16
of	16
the	16
licentiate’s	16
sword	16
that	16
checked	16
him	16
in	16
the	16
midst	16
of	16
his	16
furious	16
onset,	16
and	16
made	16
him	16
kiss	16
it	16
as	16
if	16
it	16
were	16
a	16
relic,	16
though	16
not	16
as	16
devoutly	16
as	16
relics	16
are	16
and	16
ought	16
to	16
be	16
kissed.	16
The	16
end	16
of	16
it	16
was	16
that	16
the	16
licentiate	16
reckoned	16
up	16
for	16
him	16
by	16
thrusts	16
every	16
one	16
of	16
the	16
buttons	16
of	16
the	16
short	16
cassock	16
he	16
wore,	16
tore	16
the	16
skirts	16
into	16
strips,	16
like	16
the	16
tails	16
of	16
a	16
cuttlefish,	16
knocked	16
off	16
his	16
hat	16
twice,	16
and	16
so	16
completely	16
tired	16
him	16
out,	16
that	16
in	16
vexation,	16
anger,	16
and	16
rage,	16
he	16
took	16
the	16
sword	16
by	16
the	16
hilt	16
and	16
flung	16
it	16
away	16
with	16
such	16
force,	16
that	16
one	16
of	16
the	16
peasants	16
that	16
were	16
there,	16
who	16
was	16
a	16
notary,	16
and	16
who	16
went	16
for	16
it,	16
made	16
an	16
affidavit	16
afterwards	16
that	16
he	16
sent	16
it	16
nearly	16
three-quarters	16
of	16
a	16
league,	16
which	16
testimony	16
will	16
serve,	16
and	16
has	16
served,	16
to	16
show	16
and	16
establish	16
with	16
all	16
certainty	16
that	16
strength	16
is	16
overcome	16
by	16
skill.	16
Corchuelo	16
sat	16
down	16
wearied,	16
and	16
Sancho	16
approaching	16
him	16
said,	16
“By	16
my	16
faith,	16
señor	16
bachelor,	16
if	16
your	16
worship	16
takes	16
my	16
advice,	16
you	16
will	16
never	16
challenge	16
anyone	16
to	16
fence	16
again,	16
only	16
to	16
wrestle	16
and	16
throw	16
the	16
bar,	16
for	16
you	16
have	16
the	16
youth	16
and	16
strength	16
for	16
that;	16
but	16
as	16
for	16
these	16
fencers	16
as	16
they	16
call	16
them,	16
I	16
have	16
heard	16
say	16
they	16
can	16
put	16
the	16
point	16
of	16
a	16
sword	16
through	16
the	16
eye	16
of	16
a	16
needle.”	16
“I	16
am	16
satisfied	16
with	16
having	16
tumbled	16
off	16
my	16
donkey,”	16
said	16
Corchuelo,	16
“and	16
with	16
having	16
had	16
the	16
truth	16
I	16
was	16
so	16
ignorant	16
of	16
proved	16
to	16
me	16
by	16
experience;”	16
and	16
getting	16
up	16
he	16
embraced	16
the	16
licentiate,	16
and	16
they	16
were	16
better	16
friends	16
than	16
ever;	16
and	16
not	16
caring	16
to	16
wait	16
for	16
the	16
notary	16
who	16
had	16
gone	16
for	16
the	16
sword,	16
as	16
they	16
saw	16
he	16
would	16
be	16
a	16
long	16
time	16
about	16
it,	16
they	16
resolved	16
to	16
push	16
on	16
so	16
as	16
to	16
reach	16
the	16
village	16
of	16
Quiteria,	16
to	16
which	16
they	16
all	16
belonged,	16
in	16
good	16
time.	16
During	16
the	16
remainder	16
of	16
the	16
journey	16
the	16
licentiate	16
held	16
forth	16
to	16
them	16
on	16
the	16
excellences	16
of	16
the	16
sword,	16
with	16
such	16
conclusive	16
arguments,	16
and	16
such	16
figures	16
and	16
mathematical	16
proofs,	16
that	16
all	16
were	16
convinced	16
of	16
the	16
value	16
of	16
the	16
science,	16
and	16
Corchuelo	16
cured	16
of	16
his	16
dogmatism.	16
It	16
grew	16
dark;	16
but	16
before	16
they	16
reached	16
the	16
town	16
it	16
seemed	16
to	16
them	16
all	16
as	16
if	16
there	16
was	16
a	16
heaven	16
full	16
of	16
countless	16
glittering	16
stars	16
in	16
front	16
of	16
it.	16
They	16
heard,	16
too,	16
the	16
pleasant	16
mingled	16
notes	16
of	16
a	16
variety	16
of	16
instruments,	16
flutes,	16
drums,	16
psalteries,	16
pipes,	16
tabors,	16
and	16
timbrels,	16
and	16
as	16
they	16
drew	16
near	16
they	16
perceived	16
that	16
the	16
trees	16
of	16
a	16
leafy	16
arcade	16
that	16
had	16
been	16
constructed	16
at	16
the	16
entrance	16
of	16
the	16
town	16
were	16
filled	16
with	16
lights	16
unaffected	16
by	16
the	16
wind,	16
for	16
the	16
breeze	16
at	16
the	16
time	16
was	16
so	16
gentle	16
that	16
it	16
had	16
not	16
power	16
to	16
stir	16
the	16
leaves	16
on	16
the	16
trees.	16
The	16
musicians	16
were	16
the	16
life	16
of	16
the	16
wedding,	16
wandering	16
through	16
the	16
pleasant	16
grounds	16
in	16
separate	16
bands,	16
some	16
dancing,	16
others	16
singing,	16
others	16
playing	16
the	16
various	16
instruments	16
already	16
mentioned.	16
In	16
short,	16
it	16
seemed	16
as	16
though	16
mirth	16
and	16
gaiety	16
were	16
frisking	16
and	16
gambolling	16
all	16
over	16
the	16
meadow.	16
Several	16
other	16
persons	16
were	16
engaged	16
in	16
erecting	16
raised	16
benches	16
from	16
which	16
people	16
might	16
conveniently	16
see	16
the	16
plays	16
and	16
dances	16
that	16
were	16
to	16
be	16
performed	16
the	16
next	16
day	16
on	16
the	16
spot	16
dedicated	16
to	16
the	16
celebration	16
of	16
the	16
marriage	16
of	16
Camacho	16
the	16
rich	16
and	16
the	16
obsequies	16
of	16
Basilio.	16
Don	16
Quixote	16
would	16
not	16
enter	16
the	16
village,	16
although	16
the	16
peasant	16
as	16
well	16
as	16
the	16
bachelor	16
pressed	16
him;	16
he	16
excused	16
himself,	16
however,	16
on	16
the	16
grounds,	16
amply	16
sufficient	16
in	16
his	16
opinion,	16
that	16
it	16
was	16
the	16
custom	16
of	16
knights-errant	16
to	16
sleep	16
in	16
the	16
fields	16
and	16
woods	16
in	16
preference	16
to	16
towns,	16
even	16
were	16
it	16
under	16
gilded	16
ceilings;	16
and	16
so	16
turned	16
aside	16
a	16
little	16
out	16
of	16
the	16
road,	16
very	16
much	16
against	16
Sancho’s	16
will,	16
as	16
the	16
good	16
quarters	16
he	16
had	16
enjoyed	16
in	16
the	16
castle	16
or	16
house	16
of	16
Don	16
Diego	16
came	16
back	16
to	16
his	16

sprang	16
to	16

called	16
to	16

Sancho,	16
who	16
was	16
still	16

seeing	16
which	16
Don	16
Quixote	16
ere	16
he	16
roused	16
him	16
thus	16
addressed	16
him:	16
“Happy	16
thou,	16
above	16
all	16
the	16
dwellers	16
on	16
the	16
face	16
of	16
the	16
earth,	16
that,	16
without	16
envying	16
or	16
being	16
envied,	16
sleepest	16
with	16
tranquil	16
mind,	16
and	16
that	16
neither	16
enchanters	16
persecute	16
nor	16
enchantments	16
affright.	16
Sleep,	16
I	16
say,	16
and	16
will	16
say	16
a	16
hundred	16
times,	16
without	16
any	16
jealous	16
thoughts	16
of	16
thy	16
mistress	16
to	16
make	16
thee	16
keep	16
ceaseless	16
vigils,	16
or	16
any	16
cares	16
as	16
to	16
how	16
thou	16
art	16
to	16
pay	16
the	16
debts	16
thou	16
owest,	16
or	16
find	16
to-morrow’s	16
food	16
for	16
thyself	16
and	16
thy	16
needy	16
little	16
family,	16
to	16
interfere	16
with	16
thy	16
repose.	16
Ambition	16
breaks	16
not	16
thy	16
rest,	16
nor	16
doth	16
this	16
world’s	16
empty	16
pomp	16
disturb	16
thee,	16
for	16
the	16
utmost	16
reach	16
of	16
thy	16
anxiety	16
is	16
to	16
provide	16
for	16
thy	16
ass,	16
since	16
upon	16
my	16
shoulders	16
thou	16
hast	16
laid	16
the	16
support	16
of	16
thyself,	16
the	16
counterpoise	16
and	16
burden	16
that	16
nature	16
and	16
custom	16
have	16
imposed	16
upon	16
masters.	16
The	16
servant	16
sleeps	16
and	16
the	16
master	16
lies	16
awake	16
thinking	16
how	16
he	16
is	16
to	16
feed	16
him,	16
advance	16
him,	16
and	16
reward	16
him.	16
The	16
distress	16
of	16
seeing	16
the	16
sky	16
turn	16
brazen,	16
and	16
withhold	16
its	16

earth,	16
is	16
not	16
felt	16
by	16
the	16
servant	16
but	16
by	16
the	16

who	16
in	16

him	16
who	16

of	16
plenty	16
and	16

To	16
all	16
this	16
Sancho	16
made	16
no	16
reply	16
because	16
he	16
was	16
asleep,	16
nor	16
would	16
he	16
have	16
wakened	16
up	16
so	16
soon	16
as	16
he	16
did	16
had	16
not	16
Don	16
Quixote	16
brought	16
him	16
to	16
his	16
senses	16
with	16
the	16
butt	16
of	16
his	16
lance.	16
He	16
awoke	16
at	16
last,	16
drowsy	16
and	16
lazy,	16
and	16
casting	16
his	16
eyes	16
about	16
in	16
every	16
direction,	16
observed,	16
“There	16
comes,	16
if	16
I	16
don’t	16
mistake,	16
from	16
the	16
quarter	16
of	16
that	16
arcade	16
a	16
steam	16
and	16
a	16
smell	16
a	16
great	16
deal	16
more	16
like	16
fried	16
rashers	16
than	16
galingale	16
or	16
thyme;	16
a	16
wedding	16
that	16
begins	16
with	16
smells	16
like	16
that,	16
by	16
my	16
faith,	16
ought	16
to	16
be	16
plentiful	16
and	16
unstinting.”	16
“Have	16
done,	16
thou	16
glutton,”	16
said	16
Don	16
Quixote;	16
“come,	16
let	16
us	16
go	16
and	16
witness	16
this	16
bridal,	16
and	16
see	16
what	16
the	16
rejected	16
Basilio	16
does.”	16
“Let	16
him	16
do	16
what	16
he	16
likes,”	16
returned	16
Sancho;	16
“be	16
he	16
not	16
poor,	16
he	16
would	16
marry	16
Quiteria.	16
To	16
make	16
a	16
grand	16
match	16
for	16
himself,	16
and	16
he	16
without	16
a	16
farthing;	16
is	16
there	16
nothing	16
else?	16
Faith,	16
señor,	16
it’s	16
my	16
opinion	16
the	16
poor	16
man	16
should	16
be	16
content	16
with	16
what	16
he	16
can	16
get,	16
and	16
not	16
go	16
looking	16
for	16
dainties	16
in	16
the	16
bottom	16
of	16
the	16
sea.	16
I	16
will	16
bet	16
my	16
arm	16
that	16
Camacho	16
could	16
bury	16
Basilio	16
in	16
reals;	16
and	16
if	16
that	16
be	16
so,	16
as	16
no	16
doubt	16
it	16
is,	16
what	16
a	16
fool	16
Quiteria	16
would	16
be	16
to	16
refuse	16
the	16
fine	16
dresses	16
and	16
jewels	16
Camacho	16
must	16
have	16
given	16
her	16
and	16
will	16
give	16
her,	16
and	16
take	16
Basilio’s	16
bar-throwing	16
and	16
sword-play.	16
They	16
won’t	16
give	16
a	16
pint	16
of	16
wine	16
at	16
the	16
tavern	16
for	16
a	16
good	16
cast	16
of	16
the	16
bar	16
or	16
a	16
neat	16
thrust	16
of	16
the	16
sword.	16
Talents	16
and	16
accomplishments	16
that	16
can’t	16
be	16
turned	16
into	16
money,	16
let	16
Count	16
Dirlos	16
have	16
them;	16
but	16
when	16
such	16
gifts	16
fall	16
to	16
one	16
that	16
has	16
hard	16
cash,	16
I	16
wish	16
my	16
condition	16
of	16
life	16
was	16
as	16
becoming	16
as	16
they	16
are.	16
On	16
a	16
good	16
foundation	16
you	16
can	16
raise	16
a	16
good	16
building,	16
and	16
the	16
best	16
foundation	16
in	16
the	16
world	16
is	16
money.”	16
“For	16
God’s	16
sake,	16
Sancho,”	16
said	16
Don	16
Quixote	16
here,	16
“stop	16
that	16
harangue;	16
it	16
is	16
my	16
belief,	16
if	16
thou	16
wert	16
allowed	16
to	16
continue	16
all	16
thou	16
beginnest	16
every	16
instant,	16
thou	16
wouldst	16
have	16
no	16
time	16
left	16
for	16
eating	16
or	16
sleeping;	16
for	16
thou	16
wouldst	16
spend	16
it	16
all	16
in	16
talking.”	16
“If	16
your	16
worship	16
had	16
a	16
good	16
memory,”	16
replied	16
Sancho,	16
“you	16
would	16
remember	16
the	16
articles	16
of	16
our	16
agreement	16
before	16
we	16
started	16
from	16
home	16
this	16
last	16
time;	16
one	16
of	16
them	16
was	16
that	16
I	16
was	16
to	16
be	16
let	16
say	16
all	16
I	16
liked,	16
so	16
long	16
as	16
it	16
was	16
not	16
against	16
my	16
neighbour	16
or	16
your	16
worship’s	16
authority;	16
and	16
so	16
far,	16
it	16
seems	16
to	16
me,	16
I	16
have	16
not	16
broken	16
the	16
said	16
article.”	16
“I	16
remember	16
no	16
such	16
article,	16
Sancho,”	16
said	16
Don	16
Quixote;	16
“and	16
even	16
if	16
it	16
were	16
so,	16
I	16
desire	16
you	16
to	16
hold	16
your	16
tongue	16
and	16
come	16
along;	16
for	16
the	16
instruments	16
we	16
heard	16
last	16
night	16
are	16
already	16
beginning	16
to	16
enliven	16
the	16
valleys	16
again,	16
and	16
no	16
doubt	16
the	16
marriage	16
will	16
take	16
place	16
in	16
the	16
cool	16
of	16
the	16
morning,	16
and	16
not	16
in	16
the	16
heat	16
of	16
the	16
afternoon.”	16
Sancho	16
did	16
as	16
his	16
master	16
bade	16
him,	16
and	16
putting	16
the	16
saddle	16
on	16
Rocinante	16
and	16
the	16
pack-saddle	16
on	16
Dapple,	16
they	16
both	16
mounted	16
and	16
at	16
a	16
leisurely	16
pace	16
entered	16
the	16
arcade.	16
The	16
first	16
thing	16
that	16
presented	16
itself	16
to	16
Sancho’s	16
eyes	16
was	16
a	16
whole	16
ox	16
spitted	16
on	16
a	16
whole	16
elm	16
tree,	16
and	16
in	16
the	16
fire	16
at	16
which	16
it	16
was	16
to	16
be	16
roasted	16
there	16
was	16
burning	16
a	16
middling-sized	16
mountain	16
of	16
faggots,	16
and	16
six	16
stewpots	16
that	16
stood	16
round	16
the	16
blaze	16
had	16
not	16
been	16
made	16
in	16
the	16
ordinary	16
mould	16
of	16
common	16
pots,	16
for	16
they	16
were	16
six	16
half	16
wine-jars,	16
each	16
fit	16
to	16
hold	16
the	16
contents	16
of	16
a	16
slaughter-house;	16
they	16
swallowed	16
up	16
whole	16
sheep	16
and	16
hid	16
them	16
away	16
in	16
their	16
insides	16
without	16
showing	16
any	16
more	16
sign	16
of	16
them	16
than	16
if	16
they	16
were	16
pigeons.	16
Countless	16
were	16
the	16
hares	16
ready	16
skinned	16
and	16
the	16
plucked	16
fowls	16
that	16
hung	16
on	16
the	16
trees	16
for	16
burial	16
in	16
the	16
pots,	16
numberless	16
the	16
wildfowl	16
and	16
game	16
of	16
various	16
sorts	16
suspended	16
from	16
the	16
branches	16
that	16
the	16
air	16
might	16
keep	16
them	16
cool.	16
Sancho	16
counted	16
more	16
than	16
sixty	16
wine	16
skins	16
of	16
over	16
six	16
gallons	16
each,	16
and	16
all	16
filled,	16
as	16
it	16
proved	16
afterwards,	16
with	16
generous	16
wines.	16
There	16
were,	16
besides,	16
piles	16
of	16
the	16
whitest	16
bread,	16
like	16
the	16
heaps	16
of	16
corn	16
one	16
sees	16
on	16
the	16
threshing-floors.	16
There	16
was	16
a	16
wall	16
made	16
of	16
cheeses	16
arranged	16
like	16
open	16
brick-work,	16
and	16
two	16
cauldrons	16
full	16
of	16
oil,	16
bigger	16
than	16
those	16
of	16
a	16
dyer’s	16
shop,	16
served	16
for	16
cooking	16
fritters,	16
which	16
when	16
fried	16
were	16
taken	16
out	16
with	16
two	16
mighty	16
shovels,	16
and	16
plunged	16
into	16
another	16
cauldron	16
of	16
prepared	16
honey	16
that	16
stood	16
close	16
by.	16
Of	16
cooks	16
and	16
cook-maids	16
there	16
were	16
over	16
fifty,	16
all	16
clean,	16
brisk,	16
and	16
blithe.	16
In	16
the	16
capacious	16
belly	16
of	16
the	16
ox	16
were	16
a	16
dozen	16
soft	16
little	16
sucking-pigs,	16
which,	16
sewn	16
up	16
there,	16
served	16
to	16
give	16
it	16
tenderness	16
and	16
flavour.	16
The	16
spices	16
of	16
different	16
kinds	16
did	16
not	16
seem	16
to	16
have	16
been	16
bought	16
by	16
the	16
pound	16
but	16
by	16
the	16
quarter,	16
and	16
all	16
lay	16
open	16
to	16
view	16
in	16
a	16
great	16
chest.	16
In	16
short,	16
all	16
the	16
preparations	16
made	16
for	16
the	16
wedding	16
were	16
in	16
rustic	16
style,	16
but	16
abundant	16
enough	16
to	16
feed	16
an	16
army.	16

The	16

frying-pans,	16
if,	16
indeed,	16
such	16
imposing	16
cauldrons	16
may	16
be	16
called	16
frying-pans;	16
and	16
unable	16
to	16
control	16
himself	16
or	16
bear	16
it	16
any	16
longer,	16
he	16
approached	16
one	16
of	16
the	16
busy	16
cooks	16
and	16
civilly	16
but	16
hungrily	16
begged	16
permission	16
to	16
soak	16
a	16
scrap	16
of	16
bread	16
in	16
one	16
of	16
the	16
pots;	16
to	16
which	16
the	16
cook	16
made	16
answer,	16
“Brother,	16
this	16
is	16
not	16
a	16
day	16
on	16
which	16
hunger	16
is	16
to	16
have	16
any	16
sway,	16
thanks	16
to	16
the	16
rich	16
Camacho;	16
get	16
down	16
and	16
look	16
about	16
for	16
a	16
ladle	16
and	16
skim	16
off	16
a	16
hen	16
or	16
two,	16
and	16
much	16
good	16
may	16
they	16
do	16
you.”	16
“I	16
don’t	16
see	16
one,”	16
said	16
Sancho.	16
“Wait	16
a	16
bit,”	16
said	16
the	16
cook;	16
“sinner	16
that	16
I	16
am!	16
how	16
particular	16
and	16
bashful	16
you	16
are!”	16
and	16
so	16
saying,	16
he	16
seized	16
a	16
bucket	16
and	16
plunging	16
it	16
into	16
one	16
of	16
the	16
half	16
jars	16
took	16
up	16
three	16
hens	16
and	16
a	16
couple	16
of	16
geese,	16
and	16
said	16
to	16
Sancho,	16
“Fall	16
to,	16
friend,	16
and	16
take	16
the	16
edge	16
off	16
your	16
appetite	16
with	16
these	16
skimmings	16
until	16
dinner-time	16
comes.”	16

“I	16
have	16
nothing	16
to	16
put	16
them	16
in,”	16
said	16
Sancho.	16
“Well	16
then,”	16
said	16
the	16
cook,	16
“take	16
spoon	16
and	16
all;	16
for	16
Camacho’s	16
wealth	16
and	16
happiness	16
furnish	16
everything.”	16
While	16
Sancho	16
fared	16
thus,	16
Don	16
Quixote	16
was	16
watching	16
the	16
entrance,	16
at	16
one	16
end	16
of	16
the	16
arcade,	16
of	16
some	16
twelve	16
peasants,	16
all	16
in	16
holiday	16
and	16
gala	16
dress,	16
mounted	16
on	16
twelve	16
beautiful	16
mares	16
with	16
rich	16
handsome	16
field	16
trappings	16
and	16
a	16
number	16
of	16
little	16
bells	16
attached	16
to	16
their	16
petrals,	16
who,	16
marshalled	16
in	16
regular	16
order,	16
ran	16
not	16
one	16
but	16
several	16
courses	16
over	16
the	16
meadow,	16
with	16
jubilant	16
shouts	16
and	16
cries	16
of	16
“Long	16
live	16
Camacho	16
and	16
Quiteria!	16
he	16
as	16
rich	16
as	16
she	16
is	16
fair;	16
and	16
she	16
the	16
fairest	16
on	16
earth!”	16
Hearing	16
this,	16
Don	16
Quixote	16
said	16
to	16
himself,	16
“It	16
is	16
easy	16
to	16
see	16
these	16
folk	16
have	16
never	16
seen	16
my	16
Dulcinea	16
del	16
Toboso;	16
for	16
if	16
they	16
had	16
they	16
would	16
be	16
more	16
moderate	16
in	16
their	16
praises	16
of	16
this	16
Quiteria	16
of	16
theirs.”	16
Shortly	16
after	16
this,	16
several	16
bands	16
of	16
dancers	16
of	16
various	16
sorts	16
began	16
to	16
enter	16
the	16
arcade	16
at	16
different	16
points,	16
and	16
among	16
them	16
one	16
of	16
sword-dancers	16
composed	16
of	16
some	16
four-and-twenty	16
lads	16
of	16
gallant	16
and	16
high-spirited	16
mien,	16
clad	16
in	16
the	16
finest	16
and	16
whitest	16
of	16
linen,	16
and	16
with	16
handkerchiefs	16
embroidered	16
in	16
various	16
colours	16
with	16
fine	16
silk;	16
and	16
one	16
of	16
those	16
on	16
the	16
mares	16
asked	16
an	16
active	16
youth	16
who	16
led	16
them	16
if	16
any	16
of	16
the	16
dancers	16
had	16
been	16
wounded.	16
“As	16
yet,	16
thank	16
God,	16
no	16
one	16
has	16
been	16
wounded,”	16
said	16
he,	16
“we	16
are	16
all	16
safe	16
and	16
sound;”	16
and	16
he	16
at	16
once	16
began	16
to	16
execute	16
complicated	16
figures	16
with	16
the	16
rest	16
of	16
his	16
comrades,	16
with	16
so	16
many	16
turns	16
and	16
so	16
great	16
dexterity,	16
that	16
although	16
Don	16
Quixote	16
was	16
well	16
used	16
to	16
see	16
dances	16
of	16
the	16
same	16
kind,	16
he	16
thought	16
he	16
had	16
never	16
seen	16
any	16
so	16
good	16
as	16
this.	16
He	16
also	16
admired	16
another	16
that	16
came	16
in	16
composed	16
of	16
fair	16
young	16
maidens,	16
none	16
of	16
whom	16
seemed	16
to	16
be	16
under	16
fourteen	16
or	16
over	16
eighteen	16
years	16
of	16
age,	16
all	16
clad	16
in	16
green	16
stuff,	16
with	16
their	16
locks	16
partly	16
braided,	16
partly	16
flowing	16
loose,	16
but	16
all	16
of	16
such	16
bright	16
gold	16
as	16
to	16
vie	16
with	16
the	16
sunbeams,	16
and	16
over	16
them	16
they	16
wore	16
garlands	16
of	16
jessamine,	16
roses,	16
amaranth,	16
and	16
honeysuckle.	16
At	16
their	16
head	16
were	16
a	16
venerable	16
old	16
man	16
and	16
an	16
ancient	16
dame,	16
more	16
brisk	16
and	16
active,	16
however,	16
than	16
might	16
have	16
been	16
expected	16
from	16
their	16
years.	16
The	16
notes	16
of	16
a	16
Zamora	16
bagpipe	16
accompanied	16
them,	16
and	16
with	16
modesty	16
in	16
their	16
countenances	16
and	16
in	16
their	16
eyes,	16
and	16
lightness	16
in	16
their	16
feet,	16
they	16
looked	16
the	16
best	16
dancers	16
in	16
the	16
world.	16

Following	16
these	16
there	16
came	16
an	16
artistic	16
dance	16
of	16
the	16
sort	16
they	16
call	16
“speaking	16
dances.”	16
It	16
was	16
composed	16
of	16
eight	16
nymphs	16
in	16
two	16
files,	16
with	16
the	16
god	16
Cupid	16
leading	16
one	16
and	16
Interest	16
the	16
other,	16
the	16
former	16
furnished	16
with	16
wings,	16
bow,	16
quiver	16
and	16
arrows,	16
the	16
latter	16
in	16
a	16
rich	16
dress	16
of	16
gold	16
and	16
silk	16
of	16
divers	16
colours.	16
The	16
nymphs	16
that	16
followed	16
Love	16
bore	16
their	16
names	16
written	16
on	16
white	16
parchment	16
in	16
large	16
letters	16
on	16
their	16
backs.	16
“Poetry”	16
was	16
the	16
name	16
of	16
the	16
first,	16
“Wit”	16
of	16
the	16
second,	16
“Birth”	16
of	16
the	16
third,	16
and	16
“Valour”	16
of	16
the	16
fourth.	16
Those	16
that	16
followed	16
Interest	16
were	16
distinguished	16
in	16
the	16
same	16
way;	16
the	16
badge	16
of	16
the	16
first	16
announced	16
“Liberality,”	16
that	16
of	16
the	16
second	16
“Largess,”	16
the	16
third	16
“Treasure,”	16
and	16
the	16
fourth	16
“Peaceful	16
Possession.”	16
In	16
front	16
of	16
them	16
all	16
came	16
a	16
wooden	16
castle	16
drawn	16
by	16
four	16
wild	16
men,	16
all	16
clad	16
in	16
ivy	16
and	16
hemp	16
stained	16
green,	16
and	16
looking	16
so	16
natural	16
that	16
they	16
nearly	16
terrified	16
Sancho.	16
On	16
the	16
front	16
of	16
the	16
castle	16
and	16
on	16
each	16
of	16
the	16
four	16
sides	16
of	16
its	16
frame	16
it	16
bore	16
the	16
inscription	16
“Castle	16
of	16
Caution.”	16
Four	16
skillful	16
tabor	16
and	16
flute	16
players	16
accompanied	16
them,	16
and	16
the	16
dance	16
having	16
been	16
opened,	16
Cupid,	16
after	16
executing	16
two	16
figures,	16
raised	16
his	16
eyes	16
and	16
bent	16
his	16
bow	16
against	16
a	16
damsel	16
who	16
stood	16
between	16
the	16
turrets	16
of	16
the	16
castle,	16
and	16
thus	16
addressed	16
her:	16
I	16
am	16
the	16
mighty	16
God	16
whose	16
sway	16
Is	16
potent	16
over	16
land	16
and	16
sea.	16
The	16
heavens	16
above	16
us	16
own	16
me;	16
nay,	16
The	16
shades	16
below	16
acknowledge	16
me.	16
I	16
know	16
not	16
fear,	16
I	16
have	16
my	16
will,	16
Whate’er	16
my	16
whim	16
or	16
fancy	16
be;	16
For	16
me	16
there’s	16
no	16
impossible,	16
I	16
order,	16
bind,	16
forbid,	16
set	16
free.	16
Having	16
concluded	16
the	16
stanza	16
he	16
discharged	16
an	16
arrow	16
at	16
the	16
top	16
of	16
the	16
castle,	16
and	16
went	16
back	16
to	16
his	16
place.	16
Interest	16
then	16
came	16
forward	16
and	16
went	16
through	16
two	16
more	16
figures,	16
and	16
as	16
soon	16
as	16
the	16
tabors	16
ceased,	16
he	16
said:	16
But	16
mightier	16
than	16
Love	16
am	16
I,	16
Though	16
Love	16
it	16
be	16
that	16
leads	16
me	16
on,	16
Than	16
mine	16
no	16
lineage	16
is	16
more	16
high,	16
Or	16
older,	16
underneath	16
the	16
sun.	16
To	16
use	16
me	16
rightly	16
few	16
know	16
how,	16
To	16
act	16
without	16
me	16
fewer	16
still,	16
For	16
I	16
am	16
Interest,	16
and	16
I	16
vow	16
For	16
evermore	16
to	16
do	16
thy	16
will.	16
Interest	16
retired,	16
and	16
Poetry	16
came	16
forward,	16
and	16
when	16
she	16
had	16
gone	16
through	16
her	16
figures	16
like	16
the	16
others,	16
fixing	16
her	16
eyes	16
on	16
the	16
damsel	16
of	16
the	16
castle,	16
she	16
said:	16
With	16
many	16
a	16
fanciful	16
conceit,	16
Fair	16
Lady,	16
winsome	16
Poesy	16
Her	16
soul,	16
an	16
offering	16
at	16
thy	16
feet,	16
Presents	16
in	16
sonnets	16
unto	16
thee.	16
If	16
thou	16
my	16
homage	16
wilt	16
not	16
scorn,	16
Thy	16
fortune,	16
watched	16
by	16
envious	16
eyes,	16
On	16
wings	16
of	16
poesy	16
upborne	16
Shall	16
be	16
exalted	16
to	16
the	16
skies.	16
Poetry	16
withdrew,	16
and	16
on	16
the	16
side	16
of	16
Interest	16
Liberality	16
advanced,	16
and	16
after	16
having	16
gone	16
through	16
her	16
figures,	16
said:	16
To	16
give,	16
while	16
shunning	16
each	16
extreme,	16
The	16
sparing	16
hand,	16
the	16
over-free,	16
Therein	16
consists,	16
so	16
wise	16
men	16
deem,	16
The	16
virtue	16
Liberality.	16
But	16
thee,	16
fair	16
lady,	16
to	16
enrich,	16
Myself	16
a	16
prodigal	16
I’ll	16
prove,	16
A	16
vice	16
not	16
wholly	16
shameful,	16
which	16
May	16
find	16
its	16
fair	16
excuse	16
in	16
love.	16
In	16
the	16
same	16
manner	16
all	16
the	16
characters	16
of	16
the	16
two	16
bands	16
advanced	16
and	16
retired,	16
and	16
each	16
executed	16
its	16
figures,	16
and	16
delivered	16
its	16
verses,	16
some	16
of	16
them	16
graceful,	16
some	16
burlesque,	16
but	16
Don	16
Quixote’s	16
memory	16
(though	16
he	16
had	16
an	16
excellent	16
one)	16
only	16
carried	16
away	16
those	16
that	16
have	16
been	16
just	16
quoted.	16
All	16
then	16
mingled	16
together,	16
forming	16
chains	16
and	16
breaking	16
off	16
again	16
with	16
graceful,	16
unconstrained	16
gaiety;	16
and	16
whenever	16
Love	16
passed	16
in	16
front	16
of	16
the	16
castle	16
he	16
shot	16
his	16
arrows	16
up	16
at	16
it,	16
while	16
Interest	16
broke	16
gilded	16
pellets	16
against	16
it.	16
At	16
length,	16
after	16
they	16
had	16
danced	16
a	16
good	16
while,	16
Interest	16
drew	16
out	16
a	16
great	16
purse,	16
made	16
of	16
the	16
skin	16
of	16
a	16
large	16
brindled	16
cat	16
and	16
to	16
all	16
appearance	16
full	16
of	16
money,	16
and	16
flung	16
it	16
at	16
the	16
castle,	16
and	16
with	16
the	16
force	16
of	16
the	16
blow	16
the	16
boards	16
fell	16
asunder	16
and	16
tumbled	16
down,	16
leaving	16
the	16
damsel	16
exposed	16
and	16
unprotected.	16
Interest	16
and	16
the	16
characters	16
of	16
his	16
band	16
advanced,	16
and	16
throwing	16
a	16
great	16
chain	16
of	16
gold	16
over	16
her	16
neck	16
pretended	16
to	16
take	16
her	16
and	16
lead	16
her	16
away	16
captive,	16
on	16
seeing	16
which,	16
Love	16
and	16
his	16
supporters	16
made	16
as	16
though	16
they	16
would	16
release	16
her,	16
the	16
whole	16
action	16
being	16
to	16
the	16
accompaniment	16
of	16
the	16
tabors	16
and	16
in	16
the	16
form	16
of	16
a	16
regular	16
dance.	16
The	16
wild	16
men	16
made	16
peace	16
between	16
them,	16
and	16
with	16
great	16
dexterity	16
readjusted	16
and	16
fixed	16
the	16
boards	16
of	16
the	16
castle,	16
and	16
the	16
damsel	16
once	16
more	16
ensconced	16
herself	16
within;	16
and	16
with	16
this	16
the	16
dance	16
wound	16
up,	16
to	16
the	16
great	16
enjoyment	16
of	16
the	16
beholders.	16
Don	16
Quixote	16
asked	16
one	16
of	16
the	16
nymphs	16
who	16
it	16
was	16
that	16
had	16
composed	16
and	16
arranged	16
it.	16
She	16
replied	16
that	16
it	16
was	16
a	16
beneficiary	16
of	16
the	16
town	16
who	16
had	16
a	16
nice	16
taste	16
in	16
devising	16
things	16
of	16
the	16
sort.	16
“I	16
will	16
lay	16
a	16
wager,”	16
said	16
Don	16
Quixote,	16
“that	16
the	16
same	16
bachelor	16
or	16
beneficiary	16
is	16
a	16
greater	16
friend	16
of	16
Camacho’s	16
than	16
of	16
Basilio’s,	16
and	16
that	16
he	16
is	16
better	16
at	16
satire	16
than	16
at	16
vespers;	16
he	16
has	16
introduced	16
the	16
accomplishments	16
of	16
Basilio	16
and	16
the	16
riches	16
of	16
Camacho	16
very	16
neatly	16
into	16
the	16
dance.”	16
Sancho	16
Panza,	16
who	16
was	16
listening	16
to	16
all	16
this,	16
exclaimed,	16
“The	16
king	16
is	16
my	16
cock;	16
I	16
stick	16
to	16
Camacho.”	16
“It	16
is	16
easy	16
to	16
see	16
thou	16
art	16
a	16
clown,	16
Sancho,”	16
said	16
Don	16
Quixote,	16
“and	16
one	16
of	16
that	16
sort	16
that	16
cry	16
‘Long	16
life	16
to	16
the	16
conqueror.’”	16
“I	16
don’t	16
know	16
of	16
what	16
sort	16
I	16
am,”	16
returned	16
Sancho,	16
“but	16
I	16
know	16
very	16
well	16
I’ll	16
never	16
get	16
such	16
elegant	16
skimmings	16
off	16
Basilio’s	16
pots	16
as	16
these	16
I	16
have	16
got	16
off	16
Camacho’s;”	16
and	16
he	16
showed	16
him	16
the	16
bucketful	16
of	16
geese	16
and	16
hens,	16
and	16
seizing	16
one	16
began	16
to	16
eat	16
with	16
great	16
gaiety	16
and	16
appetite,	16
saying,	16
“A	16
fig	16
for	16
the	16
accomplishments	16
of	16
Basilio!	16
As	16
much	16
as	16
thou	16
hast	16
so	16
much	16
art	16
thou	16
worth,	16
and	16
as	16
much	16
as	16
thou	16
art	16
worth	16
so	16
much	16
hast	16
thou.	16
As	16
a	16
grandmother	16
of	16
mine	16
used	16
to	16
say,	16
there	16
are	16
only	16
two	16
families	16
in	16
the	16
world,	16
the	16
Haves	16
and	16
the	16
Haven’ts;	16
and	16
she	16
stuck	16
to	16
the	16
Haves;	16
and	16
to	16
this	16
day,	16
Señor	16
Don	16
Quixote,	16
people	16
would	16
sooner	16
feel	16
the	16
pulse	16
of	16
‘Have,’	16
than	16
of	16
‘Know;’	16
an	16
ass	16
covered	16
with	16
gold	16
looks	16
better	16
than	16
a	16
horse	16
with	16
a	16
pack-saddle.	16
So	16
once	16
more	16
I	16
say	16
I	16
stick	16
to	16
Camacho,	16
the	16
bountiful	16
skimmings	16
of	16
whose	16
pots	16
are	16
geese	16
and	16
hens,	16
hares	16
and	16
rabbits;	16
but	16
of	16
Basilio’s,	16
if	16
any	16
ever	16
come	16
to	16
hand,	16
or	16
even	16
to	16
foot,	16
they’ll	16
be	16
only	16
rinsings.”	16
“Hast	16
thou	16
finished	16
thy	16
harangue,	16
Sancho?”	16
said	16
Don	16
Quixote.	16
“Of	16
course	16
I	16
have	16
finished	16
it,”	16
replied	16
Sancho,	16
“because	16
I	16
see	16
your	16
worship	16
takes	16
offence	16
at	16
it;	16
but	16
if	16
it	16
was	16
not	16
for	16
that,	16
there	16
was	16
work	16
enough	16
cut	16
out	16
for	16
three	16
days.”	16
“God	16
grant	16
I	16
may	16
see	16
thee	16
dumb	16
before	16
I	16
die,	16
Sancho,”	16
said	16
Don	16
Quixote.	16
“At	16
the	16
rate	16
we	16
are	16
going,”	16
said	16
Sancho,	16
“I’ll	16
be	16
chewing	16
clay	16
before	16
your	16
worship	16
dies;	16
and	16
then,	16
maybe,	16
I’ll	16
be	16
so	16
dumb	16
that	16
I’ll	16
not	16
say	16
a	16
word	16
until	16
the	16
end	16
of	16
the	16
world,	16
or,	16
at	16
least,	16
till	16
the	16
day	16
of	16
judgment.”	16
“Even	16
should	16
that	16
happen,	16
O	16
Sancho,”	16
said	16
Don	16
Quixote,	16
“thy	16
silence	16
will	16
never	16
come	16
up	16
to	16
all	16
thou	16
hast	16
talked,	16
art	16
talking,	16
and	16
wilt	16
talk	16
all	16
thy	16
life;	16
moreover,	16
it	16
naturally	16
stands	16
to	16
reason,	16
that	16
my	16
death	16
will	16
come	16
before	16
thine;	16
so	16
I	16
never	16
expect	16
to	16
see	16
thee	16
dumb,	16
not	16
even	16
when	16
thou	16
art	16
drinking	16
or	16
sleeping,	16
and	16
that	16
is	16
the	16
utmost	16
I	16
can	16
say.”	16
“In	16
good	16
faith,	16
señor,”	16
replied	16
Sancho,	16
“there’s	16
no	16
trusting	16
that	16
fleshless	16
one,	16
I	16
mean	16
Death,	16
who	16
devours	16
the	16
lamb	16
as	16
soon	16
as	16
the	16
sheep,	16
and,	16
as	16
I	16
have	16
heard	16
our	16
curate	16
say,	16
treads	16
with	16
equal	16
foot	16
upon	16
the	16
lofty	16
towers	16
of	16
kings	16
and	16
the	16
lowly	16
huts	16
of	16
the	16
poor.	16
That	16
lady	16
is	16
more	16
mighty	16
than	16
dainty,	16
she	16
is	16
in	16
no	16
way	16
squeamish,	16
she	16
devours	16
all	16
and	16
is	16
ready	16
for	16
all,	16
and	16
fills	16
her	16
alforjas	16
with	16
people	16
of	16
all	16
sorts,	16
ages,	16
and	16
ranks.	16
She	16
is	16
no	16
reaper	16
that	16
sleeps	16
out	16
the	16
noontide;	16
at	16
all	16
times	16
she	16
is	16
reaping	16
and	16
cutting	16
down,	16
as	16
well	16
the	16
dry	16
grass	16
as	16
the	16
green;	16
she	16
never	16
seems	16
to	16
chew,	16
but	16
bolts	16
and	16
swallows	16
all	16
that	16
is	16
put	16
before	16
her,	16
for	16
she	16
has	16
a	16
canine	16
appetite	16
that	16
is	16
never	16
satisfied;	16
and	16
though	16
she	16
has	16
no	16
belly,	16
she	16
shows	16
she	16
has	16
a	16
dropsy	16
and	16
is	16
athirst	16
to	16
drink	16
the	16
lives	16
of	16
all	16
that	16
live,	16
as	16
one	16
would	16
drink	16
a	16
jug	16
of	16
cold	16
water.”	16
“Say	16
no	16
more,	16
Sancho,”	16
said	16
Don	16
Quixote	16
at	16
this;	16
“don’t	16
try	16
to	16
better	16
it,	16
and	16
risk	16
a	16
fall;	16
for	16
in	16
truth	16
what	16
thou	16
hast	16
said	16
about	16
death	16
in	16
thy	16
rustic	16
phrase	16
is	16
what	16
a	16
good	16
preacher	16
might	16
have	16
said.	16
I	16
tell	16
thee,	16
Sancho,	16
if	16
thou	16
hadst	16
discretion	16
equal	16
to	16
thy	16
mother	16
wit,	16
thou	16
mightst	16
take	16
a	16
pulpit	16
in	16
hand,	16
and	16
go	16
about	16
the	16
world	16
preaching	16
fine	16
sermons.”	16
“He	16
preaches	16
well	16
who	16
lives	16
well,”	16
said	16
Sancho,	16
“and	16
I	16
know	16
no	16
more	16
theology	16
than	16
that.”	16
“Nor	16
needst	16
thou,”	16
said	16
Don	16
Quixote,	16
“but	16
I	16
cannot	16
conceive	16
or	16
make	16
out	16
how	16
it	16
is	16
that,	16
the	16
fear	16
of	16
God	16
being	16
the	16
beginning	16
of	16
wisdom,	16
thou,	16
who	16
art	16
more	16
afraid	16
of	16
a	16
lizard	16
than	16
of	16
him,	16
knowest	16
so	16
much.”	16
“Pass	16
judgment	16
on	16
your	16
chivalries,	16
señor,”	16
returned	16
Sancho,	16
“and	16
don’t	16
set	16
yourself	16
up	16
to	16
judge	16
of	16
other	16
men’s	16
fears	16
or	16
braveries,	16
for	16
I	16
am	16
as	16
good	16
a	16
fearer	16
of	16
God	16
as	16
my	16
neighbours;	16
but	16
leave	16
me	16
to	16
despatch	16
these	16
skimmings,	16
for	16
all	16
the	16
rest	16
is	16
only	16
idle	16
talk	16
that	16
we	16
shall	16
be	16
called	16
to	16
account	16
for	16
in	16
the	16
other	16
world;”	16
and	16
so	16
saying,	16
he	16
began	16
a	16
fresh	16
attack	16
on	16
the	16
bucket,	16
with	16
such	16
a	16
hearty	16
appetite	16
that	16
he	16
aroused	16
Don	16
Quixote’s,	16
who	16
no	16
doubt	16
would	16
have	16
helped	16
him	16
had	16
he	16
not	16
been	16
prevented	16
by	16
what	16
must	16
be	16
told	16
farther	16
on.	16

While	16
Don	16
Quixote	16
and	16
Sancho	16
were	16
engaged	16
in	16
the	16
discussion	16
set	16
forth	16
the	16
last	16
chapter,	16
they	16
heard	16
loud	16
shouts	16
and	16
a	16
great	16
noise,	16
which	16
were	16
uttered	16
and	16
made	16
by	16
the	16
men	16
on	16
the	16
mares	16
as	16
they	16
went	16
at	16
full	16
gallop,	16
shouting,	16
to	16
receive	16
the	16
bride	16
and	16
bridegroom,	16
who	16
were	16
approaching	16
with	16
musical	16
instruments	16
and	16
pageantry	16
of	16
all	16
sorts	16
around	16
them,	16
and	16
accompanied	16
by	16
the	16
priest	16
and	16
the	16
relatives	16
of	16
both,	16
and	16
all	16
the	16
most	16
distinguished	16
people	16
of	16
the	16
surrounding	16
villages.	16
When	16
Sancho	16
saw	16
the	16
bride,	16
he	16
exclaimed,	16
“By	16
my	16
faith,	16
she	16
is	16
not	16
dressed	16
like	16
a	16
country	16
girl,	16
but	16
like	16
some	16
fine	16
court	16
lady;	16
egad,	16
as	16
well	16
as	16
I	16
can	16
make	16
out,	16
the	16
patena	16
she	16
wears	16
rich	16
coral,	16
and	16
her	16
green	16
Cuenca	16
stuff	16
is	16
thirty-pile	16
velvet;	16
and	16
then	16
the	16
white	16
linen	16
trimming—by	16
my	16
oath,	16
but	16
it’s	16
satin!	16
Look	16
at	16
her	16
hands—jet	16
rings	16
on	16
them!	16
May	16
I	16
never	16
have	16
luck	16
if	16
they’re	16
not	16
gold	16
rings,	16
and	16
real	16
gold,	16
and	16
set	16
with	16
pearls	16
as	16
white	16
as	16
a	16
curdled	16
milk,	16
and	16
every	16
one	16
of	16
them	16
worth	16
an	16
eye	16
of	16
one’s	16
head!	16
Whoreson	16
baggage,	16
what	16
hair	16
she	16
has!	16
if	16
it’s	16
not	16
a	16
wig,	16
I	16
never	16
saw	16
longer	16
or	16
fairer	16
all	16
the	16
days	16
of	16
my	16
life.	16
See	16
how	16
bravely	16
she	16
bears	16
herself—and	16
her	16
shape!	16
Wouldn’t	16
you	16
say	16
she	16
was	16
like	16
a	16
walking	16
palm	16
tree	16
loaded	16
with	16
clusters	16
of	16
dates?	16
for	16
the	16
trinkets	16
she	16
has	16
hanging	16
from	16
her	16
hair	16
and	16
neck	16
look	16
just	16
like	16
them.	16
I	16
swear	16
in	16
my	16
heart	16
she	16
is	16
a	16
brave	16
lass,	16
and	16
fit	16
‘to	16
pass	16
over	16
the	16
banks	16
of	16
Flanders.’”	16
Don	16
Quixote	16
laughed	16
at	16
Sancho’s	16
boorish	16
eulogies	16
and	16
thought	16
that,	16
saving	16
his	16
lady	16
Dulcinea	16
del	16
Toboso,	16
he	16
had	16
never	16
seen	16
a	16
more	16
beautiful	16
woman.	16
The	16
fair	16
Quiteria	16
appeared	16
somewhat	16
pale,	16
which	16
was,	16
no	16
doubt,	16
because	16
of	16
the	16
bad	16
night	16
brides	16
always	16
pass	16
dressing	16
themselves	16
out	16
for	16
their	16
wedding	16
on	16
the	16
morrow.	16
They	16
advanced	16
towards	16
a	16
theatre	16
that	16
stood	16
on	16
one	16
side	16
of	16
the	16
meadow	16
decked	16
with	16
carpets	16
and	16
boughs,	16
where	16
they	16
were	16
to	16
plight	16
their	16
troth,	16
and	16
from	16
which	16
they	16
were	16
to	16
behold	16
the	16
dances	16
and	16
plays;	16
but	16
at	16
the	16
moment	16
of	16
their	16
arrival	16
at	16
the	16
spot	16
they	16
heard	16
a	16
loud	16
outcry	16
behind	16
them,	16
and	16
a	16
voice	16
exclaiming,	16
“Wait	16
a	16
little,	16
ye,	16
as	16
inconsiderate	16
as	16
ye	16
are	16
hasty!”	16
At	16
these	16
words	16
all	16
turned	16
round,	16
and	16
perceived	16
that	16
the	16
speaker	16
was	16
a	16
man	16
clad	16
in	16
what	16
seemed	16
to	16
be	16
a	16
loose	16
black	16
coat	16
garnished	16
with	16
crimson	16
patches	16
like	16
flames.	16
He	16
was	16
crowned	16
(as	16
was	16
presently	16
seen)	16
with	16
a	16
crown	16
of	16
gloomy	16
cypress,	16
and	16
in	16
his	16
hand	16
he	16
held	16
a	16
long	16
staff.	16
As	16
he	16
approached	16
he	16
was	16
recognised	16
by	16
everyone	16
as	16
the	16
gay	16
Basilio,	16
and	16
all	16
waited	16
anxiously	16
to	16
see	16
what	16
would	16
come	16
of	16
his	16
words,	16
in	16
dread	16
of	16
some	16
catastrophe	16
in	16
consequence	16
of	16
his	16
appearance	16
at	16
such	16
a	16
moment.	16
He	16
came	16
up	16
at	16
last	16
weary	16
and	16
breathless,	16
and	16
planting	16
himself	16
in	16
front	16
of	16
the	16
bridal	16
pair,	16
drove	16
his	16
staff,	16
which	16
had	16
a	16
steel	16
spike	16
at	16
the	16
end,	16
into	16
the	16
ground,	16
and,	16
with	16
a	16
pale	16
face	16
and	16
eyes	16
fixed	16
on	16
Quiteria,	16
he	16
thus	16
addressed	16
her	16
in	16
a	16
hoarse,	16
trembling	16
voice:	16
“Well	16
dost	16
thou	16
know,	16
ungrateful	16
Quiteria,	16
that	16
according	16
to	16
the	16
holy	16
law	16
we	16
acknowledge,	16
so	16
long	16
as	16
live	16
thou	16
canst	16
take	16
no	16
husband;	16
nor	16
art	16
thou	16
ignorant	16
either	16
that,	16
in	16
my	16
hopes	16
that	16
time	16
and	16
my	16
own	16
exertions	16
would	16
improve	16
my	16
fortunes,	16
I	16
have	16
never	16
failed	16
to	16
observe	16
the	16
respect	16
due	16
to	16
thy	16
honour;	16
but	16
thou,	16
casting	16
behind	16
thee	16
all	16
thou	16
owest	16
to	16
my	16
true	16
love,	16
wouldst	16
surrender	16
what	16
is	16
mine	16
to	16
another	16
whose	16
wealth	16
serves	16
to	16
bring	16
him	16
not	16
only	16
good	16
fortune	16
but	16
supreme	16
happiness;	16
and	16
now	16
to	16
complete	16
it	16
(not	16
that	16
I	16
think	16
he	16
deserves	16
it,	16
but	16
inasmuch	16
as	16
heaven	16
is	16
pleased	16
to	16
bestow	16
it	16
upon	16
him),	16
I	16
will,	16
with	16
my	16
own	16
hands,	16
do	16
away	16
with	16
the	16
obstacle	16
that	16
may	16
interfere	16
with	16
it,	16
and	16
remove	16
myself	16
from	16
between	16
you.	16
Long	16
live	16
the	16
rich	16
Camacho!	16
many	16
a	16
happy	16
year	16
may	16
he	16
live	16
with	16
the	16
ungrateful	16
Quiteria!	16
and	16
let	16
the	16
poor	16
Basilio	16
die,	16
Basilio	16
whose	16
poverty	16
clipped	16
the	16
wings	16
of	16
his	16
happiness,	16
and	16
brought	16
him	16
to	16
the	16
grave!”	16
And	16
so	16
saying,	16
he	16
seized	16
the	16
staff	16
he	16
had	16
driven	16
into	16
the	16
ground,	16
and	16
leaving	16
one	16
half	16
of	16
it	16
fixed	16
there,	16
showed	16
it	16
to	16
be	16
a	16
sheath	16
that	16
concealed	16
a	16
tolerably	16
long	16
rapier;	16
and,	16
what	16
may	16
be	16
called	16
its	16
hilt	16
being	16
planted	16
in	16
the	16
ground,	16
he	16
swiftly,	16
coolly,	16
and	16
deliberately	16
threw	16
himself	16
upon	16
it,	16
and	16
in	16
an	16
instant	16
the	16
bloody	16
point	16
and	16
half	16
the	16
steel	16
blade	16
appeared	16
at	16
his	16
back,	16
the	16
unhappy	16
man	16
falling	16
to	16
the	16
earth	16
bathed	16
in	16
his	16
blood,	16
and	16
transfixed	16
by	16
his	16
own	16
weapon.	16
His	16
friends	16
at	16
once	16
ran	16
to	16
his	16
aid,	16
filled	16
with	16
grief	16
at	16
his	16
misery	16
and	16
sad	16
fate,	16
and	16
Don	16
Quixote,	16
dismounting	16
from	16
Rocinante,	16
hastened	16
to	16
support	16
him,	16
and	16
took	16
him	16
in	16
his	16
arms,	16
and	16
found	16
he	16
had	16
not	16
yet	16
ceased	16
to	16
breathe.	16
They	16
were	16
about	16
to	16
draw	16
out	16
the	16
rapier,	16
but	16
the	16
priest	16
who	16
was	16
standing	16
by	16
objected	16
to	16
its	16
being	16
withdrawn	16
before	16
he	16
had	16
confessed	16
him,	16
as	16
the	16
instant	16
of	16
its	16
withdrawal	16
would	16
be	16
that	16
of	16
this	16
death.	16
Basilio,	16
however,	16
reviving	16
slightly,	16
said	16
in	16
a	16
weak	16
voice,	16
as	16
though	16
in	16
pain,	16
“If	16
thou	16
wouldst	16
consent,	16
cruel	16
Quiteria,	16
to	16
give	16
me	16
thy	16
hand	16
as	16
my	16
bride	16
in	16
this	16
last	16
fatal	16
moment,	16
I	16
might	16
still	16
hope	16
that	16
my	16
rashness	16
would	16
find	16
pardon,	16
as	16
by	16
its	16
means	16
I	16
attained	16
the	16
bliss	16
of	16
being	16
thine.”	16
Hearing	16
this	16
the	16
priest	16
bade	16
him	16
think	16
of	16
the	16
welfare	16
of	16
his	16
soul	16
rather	16
than	16
of	16
the	16
cravings	16
of	16
the	16
body,	16
and	16
in	16
all	16
earnestness	16
implore	16
God’s	16
pardon	16
for	16
his	16
sins	16
and	16
for	16
his	16
rash	16
resolve;	16
to	16
which	16
Basilio	16
replied	16
that	16
he	16
was	16
determined	16
not	16
to	16
confess	16
unless	16
Quiteria	16
first	16
gave	16
him	16
her	16
hand	16
in	16
marriage,	16
for	16
that	16
happiness	16
would	16
compose	16
his	16
mind	16
and	16
give	16
him	16
courage	16
to	16
make	16
his	16
confession.	16
Don	16
Quixote	16
hearing	16
the	16
wounded	16
man’s	16
entreaty,	16
exclaimed	16
aloud	16
that	16
what	16
Basilio	16
asked	16
was	16
just	16
and	16
reasonable,	16
and	16
moreover	16
a	16
request	16
that	16
might	16
be	16
easily	16
complied	16
with;	16
and	16
that	16
it	16
would	16
be	16
as	16
much	16
to	16
Señor	16
Camacho’s	16
honour	16
to	16
receive	16
the	16
lady	16
Quiteria	16
as	16
the	16
widow	16
of	16
the	16
brave	16
Basilio	16
as	16
if	16
he	16
received	16
her	16
direct	16
from	16
her	16
father.	16
“In	16
this	16
case,”	16
said	16
he,	16
“it	16
will	16
be	16
only	16
to	16
say	16
‘yes,’	16
and	16
no	16
consequences	16
can	16
follow	16
the	16
utterance	16
of	16
the	16
word,	16
for	16
the	16
nuptial	16
couch	16
of	16
this	16
marriage	16
must	16
be	16
the	16
grave.”	16
Camacho	16
was	16
listening	16
to	16
all	16
this,	16
perplexed	16
and	16
bewildered	16
and	16
not	16
knowing	16
what	16
to	16
say	16
or	16
do;	16
but	16
so	16
urgent	16
were	16
the	16
entreaties	16
of	16
Basilio’s	16
friends,	16
imploring	16
him	16
to	16
allow	16
Quiteria	16
to	16
give	16
him	16
her	16
hand,	16
so	16
that	16
his	16
soul,	16
quitting	16
this	16
life	16
in	16
despair,	16
should	16
not	16
be	16
lost,	16
that	16
they	16
moved,	16
nay,	16
forced	16
him,	16
to	16
say	16
that	16
if	16
Quiteria	16
were	16
willing	16
to	16
give	16
it	16
he	16
was	16
satisfied,	16
as	16
it	16
was	16
only	16
putting	16
off	16
the	16
fulfillment	16
of	16
his	16
wishes	16
for	16
a	16
moment.	16
At	16
once	16
all	16
assailed	16
Quiteria	16
and	16
pressed	16
her,	16
some	16
with	16
prayers,	16
and	16
others	16
with	16
tears,	16
and	16
others	16
with	16
persuasive	16
arguments,	16
to	16
give	16
her	16
hand	16
to	16
poor	16
Basilio;	16
but	16
she,	16
harder	16
than	16
marble	16
and	16
more	16
unmoved	16
than	16
any	16
statue,	16
seemed	16
unable	16
or	16
unwilling	16
to	16
utter	16
a	16
word,	16
nor	16
would	16
she	16
have	16
given	16
any	16
reply	16
had	16
not	16
the	16
priest	16
bade	16
her	16
decide	16
quickly	16
what	16
she	16
meant	16
to	16
do,	16
as	16
Basilio	16
now	16
had	16
his	16
soul	16
at	16
his	16
teeth,	16
and	16
there	16
was	16
no	16
time	16
for	16
hesitation.	16

On	16
this	16
the	16
fair	16
Quiteria,	16
to	16
all	16
appearance	16
distressed,	16
grieved,	16
and	16
repentant,	16
advanced	16
without	16
a	16
word	16
to	16
where	16
Basilio	16
lay,	16
his	16
eyes	16
already	16
turned	16
in	16
his	16
head,	16
his	16
breathing	16
short	16
and	16
painful,	16
murmuring	16
the	16
name	16
of	16
Quiteria	16
between	16
his	16
teeth,	16
and	16
apparently	16
about	16
to	16
die	16
like	16
a	16
heathen	16
and	16
not	16
like	16
a	16
Christian.	16
Quiteria	16
approached	16
him,	16
and	16
kneeling,	16
demanded	16
his	16
hand	16
by	16
signs	16
without	16
speaking.	16
Basilio	16
opened	16
his	16
eyes	16
and	16
gazing	16
fixedly	16
at	16
her,	16
said,	16
“O	16
Quiteria,	16
why	16
hast	16
thou	16
turned	16
compassionate	16
at	16
a	16
moment	16
when	16
thy	16
compassion	16
will	16
serve	16
as	16
a	16
dagger	16
to	16
rob	16
me	16
of	16
life,	16
for	16
I	16
have	16
not	16
now	16
the	16
strength	16
left	16
either	16
to	16
bear	16
the	16
happiness	16
thou	16
givest	16
me	16
in	16
accepting	16
me	16
as	16
thine,	16
or	16
to	16
suppress	16
the	16
pain	16
that	16
is	16
rapidly	16
drawing	16
the	16
dread	16
shadow	16
of	16
death	16
over	16
my	16
eyes?	16
What	16
I	16
entreat	16
of	16
thee,	16
O	16
thou	16
fatal	16
star	16
to	16
me,	16
is	16
that	16
the	16
hand	16
thou	16
demandest	16
of	16
me	16
and	16
wouldst	16
give	16
me,	16
be	16
not	16
given	16
out	16
of	16
complaisance	16
or	16
to	16
deceive	16
me	16
afresh,	16
but	16
that	16
thou	16
confess	16
and	16
declare	16
that	16
without	16
any	16
constraint	16
upon	16
thy	16
will	16
thou	16
givest	16
it	16
to	16
me	16
as	16
to	16
thy	16
lawful	16
husband;	16
for	16
it	16
is	16
not	16
meet	16
that	16
thou	16
shouldst	16
trifle	16
with	16
me	16
at	16
such	16
a	16
moment	16
as	16
this,	16
or	16
have	16
recourse	16
to	16
falsehoods	16
with	16
one	16
who	16
has	16
dealt	16
so	16
truly	16
by	16
thee.”	16
While	16
uttering	16
these	16
words	16
he	16
showed	16
such	16
weakness	16
that	16
the	16
bystanders	16
expected	16
each	16
return	16
of	16
faintness	16
would	16
take	16
his	16
life	16
with	16
it.	16
Then	16
Quiteria,	16
overcome	16
with	16
modesty	16
and	16
shame,	16
holding	16
in	16
her	16
right	16
hand	16
the	16
hand	16
of	16
Basilio,	16
said,	16
“No	16
force	16
would	16
bend	16
my	16
will;	16
as	16
freely,	16
therefore,	16
as	16
it	16
is	16
possible	16
for	16
me	16
to	16
do	16
so,	16
I	16
give	16
thee	16
the	16
hand	16
of	16
a	16
lawful	16
wife,	16
and	16
take	16
thine	16
if	16
thou	16
givest	16
it	16
to	16
me	16
of	16
thine	16
own	16
free	16
will,	16
untroubled	16
and	16
unaffected	16
by	16
the	16
calamity	16
thy	16
hasty	16
act	16
has	16
brought	16
upon	16
thee.”	16
“Yes,	16
I	16
give	16
it,”	16
said	16
Basilio,	16
“not	16
agitated	16
or	16
distracted,	16
but	16
with	16
unclouded	16
reason	16
that	16
heaven	16
is	16
pleased	16
to	16
grant	16
me,	16
thus	16
do	16
I	16
give	16
myself	16
to	16
be	16
thy	16
husband.”	16
“And	16
I	16
give	16
myself	16
to	16
be	16
thy	16
wife,”	16
said	16
Quiteria,	16
“whether	16
thou	16
livest	16
many	16
years,	16
or	16
they	16
carry	16
thee	16
from	16
my	16
arms	16
to	16
the	16
grave.”	16
“For	16
one	16
so	16
badly	16
wounded,”	16
observed	16
Sancho	16
at	16
this	16
point,	16
“this	16
young	16
man	16
has	16
a	16
great	16
deal	16
to	16
say;	16
they	16
should	16
make	16
him	16
leave	16
off	16
billing	16
and	16
cooing,	16
and	16
attend	16
to	16
his	16
soul;	16
for	16
to	16
my	16
thinking	16
he	16
has	16
it	16
more	16
on	16
his	16
tongue	16
than	16
at	16
his	16
teeth.”	16
Basilio	16
and	16
Quiteria	16
having	16
thus	16
joined	16
hands,	16
the	16
priest,	16
deeply	16
moved	16
and	16
with	16
tears	16
in	16
his	16
eyes,	16
pronounced	16
the	16
blessing	16
upon	16
them,	16
and	16
implored	16
heaven	16
to	16
grant	16
an	16
easy	16
passage	16
to	16
the	16
soul	16
of	16
the	16
newly	16
wedded	16
man,	16
who,	16
the	16
instant	16
he	16
received	16
the	16
blessing,	16
started	16
nimbly	16
to	16
his	16
feet	16
and	16
with	16
unparalleled	16
effrontery	16
pulled	16
out	16
the	16
rapier	16
that	16
had	16
been	16
sheathed	16
in	16
his	16
body.	16
All	16
the	16
bystanders	16
were	16
astounded,	16
and	16
some,	16
more	16
simple	16
than	16
inquiring,	16
began	16
shouting,	16
“A	16
miracle,	16
a	16
miracle!”	16
But	16
Basilio	16
replied,	16
“No	16
miracle,	16
no	16
miracle;	16
only	16
a	16
trick,	16
a	16
trick!”	16
The	16
priest,	16
perplexed	16
and	16
amazed,	16
made	16
haste	16
to	16
examine	16
the	16
wound	16
with	16
both	16
hands,	16
and	16
found	16
that	16
the	16
blade	16
had	16
passed,	16
not	16
through	16
Basilio’s	16
flesh	16
and	16
ribs,	16
but	16
through	16
a	16
hollow	16
iron	16
tube	16
full	16
of	16
blood,	16
which	16
he	16
had	16
adroitly	16
fixed	16
at	16
the	16
place,	16
the	16
blood,	16
as	16
was	16
afterwards	16
ascertained,	16
having	16
been	16
so	16
prepared	16
as	16
not	16
to	16
congeal.	16
In	16
short,	16
the	16
priest	16
and	16
Camacho	16
and	16
most	16
of	16
those	16
present	16
saw	16
they	16
were	16
tricked	16
and	16
made	16
fools	16
of.	16
The	16
bride	16
showed	16
no	16
signs	16
of	16
displeasure	16
at	16
the	16
deception;	16
on	16
the	16
contrary,	16
hearing	16
them	16
say	16
that	16
the	16
marriage,	16
being	16
fraudulent,	16
would	16
not	16
be	16
valid,	16
she	16
said	16
that	16
she	16
confirmed	16
it	16
afresh,	16
whence	16
they	16
all	16
concluded	16
that	16
the	16
affair	16
had	16
been	16
planned	16
by	16
agreement	16
and	16
understanding	16
between	16
the	16
pair,	16
whereat	16
Camacho	16
and	16
his	16
supporters	16
were	16
so	16
mortified	16
that	16
they	16
proceeded	16
to	16
revenge	16
themselves	16
by	16
violence,	16
and	16
a	16
great	16
number	16
of	16
them	16
drawing	16
their	16
swords	16
attacked	16
Basilio,	16
in	16
whose	16
protection	16
as	16
many	16
more	16
swords	16
were	16
in	16
an	16
instant	16
unsheathed,	16
while	16
Don	16
Quixote	16
taking	16
the	16
lead	16
on	16
horseback,	16
with	16
his	16
lance	16
over	16
his	16
arm	16
and	16
well	16
covered	16
with	16
his	16
shield,	16
made	16
all	16
give	16
way	16
before	16
him.	16
Sancho,	16
who	16
never	16
found	16
any	16
pleasure	16
or	16
enjoyment	16
in	16
such	16
doings,	16
retreated	16
to	16
the	16
wine-jars	16
from	16
which	16
he	16
had	16
taken	16
his	16
delectable	16
skimmings,	16
considering	16
that,	16
as	16
a	16
holy	16
place,	16
that	16
spot	16
would	16
be	16
respected.	16
“Hold,	16
sirs,	16
hold!”	16
cried	16
Don	16
Quixote	16
in	16
a	16
loud	16
voice;	16
“we	16
have	16
no	16
right	16
to	16
take	16
vengeance	16
for	16
wrongs	16
that	16
love	16
may	16
do	16
to	16
us:	16
remember	16
love	16
and	16
war	16
are	16
the	16
same	16
thing,	16
and	16
as	16
in	16
war	16
it	16
is	16
allowable	16
and	16
common	16
to	16
make	16
use	16
of	16
wiles	16
and	16
stratagems	16
to	16
overcome	16
the	16
enemy,	16
so	16
in	16
the	16
contests	16
and	16
rivalries	16
of	16
love	16
the	16
tricks	16
and	16
devices	16
employed	16
to	16
attain	16
the	16
desired	16
end	16
are	16
justifiable,	16
provided	16
they	16
be	16
not	16
to	16
the	16
discredit	16
or	16
dishonour	16
of	16
the	16
loved	16
object.	16
Quiteria	16
belonged	16
to	16
Basilio	16
and	16
Basilio	16
to	16
Quiteria	16
by	16
the	16
just	16
and	16
beneficent	16
disposal	16
of	16
heaven.	16
Camacho	16
is	16
rich,	16
and	16
can	16
purchase	16
his	16
pleasure	16
when,	16
where,	16
and	16
as	16
it	16
pleases	16
him.	16
Basilio	16
has	16
but	16
this	16
ewe-lamb,	16
and	16
no	16
one,	16
however	16
powerful	16
he	16
may	16
be,	16
shall	16
take	16
her	16
from	16
him;	16
these	16
two	16
whom	16
God	16
hath	16
joined	16
man	16
cannot	16
separate;	16
and	16
he	16
who	16
attempts	16
it	16
must	16
first	16
pass	16
the	16
point	16
of	16
this	16
lance;”	16
and	16
so	16
saying	16
he	16
brandished	16
it	16
so	16
stoutly	16
and	16
dexterously	16
that	16
he	16
overawed	16
all	16
who	16
did	16
not	16
know	16
him.	16
But	16
so	16
deep	16
an	16
impression	16
had	16
the	16
rejection	16
of	16
Quiteria	16
made	16
on	16
Camacho’s	16
mind	16
that	16
it	16
banished	16
her	16
at	16
once	16
from	16
his	16
thoughts;	16
and	16
so	16
the	16
counsels	16
of	16
the	16
priest,	16
who	16
was	16
a	16
wise	16
and	16
kindly	16
disposed	16
man,	16
prevailed	16
with	16
him,	16
and	16
by	16
their	16
means	16
he	16
and	16
his	16
partisans	16
were	16
pacified	16
and	16
tranquillised,	16
and	16
to	16
prove	16
it	16
put	16
up	16
their	16
swords	16
again,	16
inveighing	16
against	16
the	16
pliancy	16
of	16
Quiteria	16
rather	16
than	16
the	16
craftiness	16
of	16
Basilio;	16
Camacho	16
maintaining	16
that,	16
if	16
Quiteria	16
as	16
a	16
maiden	16
had	16
such	16
a	16
love	16
for	16
Basilio,	16
she	16
would	16
have	16
loved	16
him	16
too	16
as	16
a	16
married	16
woman,	16
and	16
that	16
he	16
ought	16
to	16
thank	16
heaven	16
more	16
for	16
having	16
taken	16
her	16
than	16
for	16
having	16
given	16
her.	16
Camacho	16
and	16
those	16
of	16
his	16
following,	16
therefore,	16
being	16
consoled	16
and	16
pacified,	16
those	16
on	16
Basilio’s	16
side	16
were	16
appeased;	16
and	16
the	16
rich	16
Camacho,	16
to	16
show	16
that	16
he	16
felt	16
no	16
resentment	16
for	16
the	16
trick,	16
and	16
did	16
not	16
care	16
about	16
it,	16
desired	16
the	16
festival	16
to	16
go	16
on	16
just	16
as	16
if	16
he	16
were	16
married	16
in	16
reality.	16
Neither	16
Basilio,	16
however,	16
nor	16
his	16
bride,	16
nor	16
their	16
followers	16
would	16
take	16
any	16
part	16
in	16
it,	16
and	16
they	16
withdrew	16
to	16
Basilio’s	16
village;	16
for	16
the	16
poor,	16
if	16
they	16
are	16
persons	16
of	16
virtue	16
and	16
good	16
sense,	16
have	16
those	16
who	16
follow,	16
honour,	16
and	16
uphold	16
them,	16
just	16
as	16
the	16
rich	16
have	16
those	16
who	16
flatter	16
and	16
dance	16
attendance	16
on	16
them.	16
With	16
them	16
they	16
carried	16
Don	16
Quixote,	16
regarding	16
him	16
as	16
a	16
man	16
of	16
worth	16
and	16
a	16
stout	16
one.	16
Sancho	16
alone	16
had	16
a	16
cloud	16
on	16
his	16
soul,	16
for	16
he	16
found	16
himself	16
debarred	16
from	16
waiting	16
for	16
Camacho’s	16
splendid	16
feast	16
and	16
festival,	16
which	16
lasted	16
until	16
night;	16
and	16
thus	16
dragged	16
away,	16
he	16
moodily	16
followed	16
his	16
master,	16
who	16
accompanied	16
Basilio’s	16
party,	16
and	16
left	16
behind	16
him	16
the	16
flesh-pots	16
of	16
Egypt;	16
though	16
in	16
his	16
heart	16
he	16
took	16
them	16
with	16
him,	16
and	16
their	16
now	16
nearly	16
finished	16
skimmings	16
that	16
he	16
carried	16
in	16
the	16
bucket	16
conjured	16
up	16
visions	16
before	16
his	16
eyes	16
of	16
the	16
glory	16
and	16
abundance	16
of	16
the	16
good	16
cheer	16
he	16
was	16
losing.	16
And	16
so,	16
vexed	16
and	16
dejected	16
though	16
not	16
hungry,	16
without	16
dismounting	16
from	16
Dapple	16
he	16
followed	16
in	16
the	16
footsteps	16
of	16
Rocinante.	16

Many	16
and	16
great	16
were	16
the	16
attentions	16
shown	16
to	16
Don	16
Quixote	16
by	16
the	16
newly	16
married	16
couple,	16
who	16
felt	16
themselves	16
under	16
an	16
obligation	16
to	16
him	16
for	16
coming	16
forward	16
in	16
defence	16
of	16
their	16
cause;	16
and	16
they	16
exalted	16
his	16
wisdom	16
to	16
the	16
same	16
level	16
with	16
his	16
courage,	16
rating	16
him	16
as	16
a	16
Cid	16
in	16
arms,	16
and	16
a	16
Cicero	16
in	16
eloquence.	16
Worthy	16
Sancho	16
enjoyed	16
himself	16
for	16
three	16
days	16
at	16
the	16
expense	16
of	16
the	16
pair,	16
from	16
whom	16
they	16
learned	16
that	16
the	16
sham	16
wound	16
was	16
not	16
a	16
scheme	16
arranged	16
with	16
the	16
fair	16
Quiteria,	16
but	16
a	16
device	16
of	16
Basilio’s,	16
who	16
counted	16
on	16
exactly	16
the	16
result	16
they	16
had	16
seen;	16
he	16
confessed,	16
it	16
is	16
true,	16
that	16
he	16
had	16
confided	16
his	16
idea	16
to	16
some	16
of	16
his	16
friends,	16
so	16
that	16
at	16
the	16
proper	16
time	16
they	16
might	16
aid	16
him	16
in	16
his	16
purpose	16
and	16
insure	16
the	16
success	16
of	16
the	16
deception.	16

“That,”	16
said	16
Don	16
Quixote,	16
“is	16
not	16
and	16
ought	16
not	16
to	16
be	16
called	16
deception	16
which	16
aims	16
at	16
virtuous	16
ends;”	16
and	16
the	16
marriage	16
of	16
lovers	16
he	16
maintained	16
to	16
be	16
a	16
most	16
excellent	16
end,	16
reminding	16
them,	16
however,	16
that	16
love	16
has	16
no	16
greater	16
enemy	16
than	16
hunger	16
and	16
constant	16
want;	16
for	16
love	16
is	16
all	16
gaiety,	16
enjoyment,	16
and	16
happiness,	16
especially	16
when	16
the	16
lover	16
is	16
in	16
the	16
possession	16
of	16
the	16
object	16
of	16
his	16
love,	16
and	16
poverty	16
and	16
want	16
are	16
the	16
declared	16
enemies	16
of	16
all	16
these;	16
which	16
he	16
said	16
to	16
urge	16
Señor	16
Basilio	16
to	16
abandon	16
the	16
practice	16
of	16
those	16
accomplishments	16
he	16
was	16
skilled	16
in,	16
for	16
though	16
they	16
brought	16
him	16
fame,	16
they	16
brought	16
him	16
no	16
money,	16
and	16
apply	16
himself	16
to	16
the	16
acquisition	16
of	16
wealth	16
by	16
legitimate	16
industry,	16
which	16
will	16
never	16
fail	16
those	16
who	16
are	16
prudent	16
and	16
persevering.	16
The	16
poor	16
man	16
who	16
is	16
a	16
man	16
of	16
honour	16
(if	16
indeed	16
a	16
poor	16
man	16
can	16
be	16
a	16
man	16
of	16
honour)	16
has	16
a	16
jewel	16
when	16
he	16
has	16
a	16
fair	16
wife,	16
and	16
if	16
she	16
is	16
taken	16
from	16
him,	16
his	16
honour	16
is	16
taken	16
from	16
him	16
and	16
slain.	16
The	16
fair	16
woman	16
who	16
is	16
a	16
woman	16
of	16
honour,	16
and	16
whose	16
husband	16
is	16
poor,	16
deserves	16
to	16
be	16
crowned	16
with	16
the	16
laurels	16
and	16
crowns	16
of	16
victory	16
and	16
triumph.	16
Beauty	16
by	16
itself	16
attracts	16
the	16
desires	16
of	16
all	16
who	16
behold	16
it,	16
and	16
the	16
royal	16
eagles	16
and	16
birds	16
of	16
towering	16
flight	16
stoop	16
on	16
it	16
as	16
on	16
a	16
dainty	16
lure;	16
but	16
if	16
beauty	16
be	16
accompanied	16
by	16
want	16
and	16
penury,	16
then	16
the	16
ravens	16
and	16
the	16
kites	16
and	16
other	16
birds	16
of	16
prey	16
assail	16
it,	16
and	16
she	16
who	16
stands	16
firm	16
against	16
such	16
attacks	16
well	16
deserves	16
to	16
be	16
called	16
the	16
crown	16
of	16
her	16
husband.	16
“Remember,	16
O	16
prudent	16
Basilio,”	16
added	16
Don	16
Quixote,	16
“it	16
was	16
the	16
opinion	16
of	16
a	16
certain	16
sage,	16
I	16
know	16
not	16
whom,	16
that	16
there	16
was	16
not	16
more	16
than	16
one	16
good	16
woman	16
in	16
the	16
whole	16
world;	16
and	16
his	16
advice	16
was	16
that	16
each	16
one	16
should	16
think	16
and	16
believe	16
that	16
this	16
one	16
good	16
woman	16
was	16
his	16
own	16
wife,	16
and	16
in	16
this	16
way	16
he	16
would	16
live	16
happy.	16
I	16
myself	16
am	16
not	16
married,	16
nor,	16
so	16
far,	16
has	16
it	16
ever	16
entered	16
my	16
thoughts	16
to	16
be	16
so;	16
nevertheless	16
I	16
would	16
venture	16
to	16
give	16
advice	16
to	16
anyone	16
who	16
might	16
ask	16
it,	16
as	16
to	16
the	16
mode	16
in	16
which	16
he	16
should	16
seek	16
a	16
wife	16
such	16
as	16
he	16
would	16
be	16
content	16
to	16
marry.	16
The	16
first	16
thing	16
I	16
would	16
recommend	16
him,	16
would	16
be	16
to	16
look	16
to	16
good	16
name	16
rather	16
than	16
to	16
wealth,	16
for	16
a	16
good	16
woman	16
does	16
not	16
win	16
a	16
good	16
name	16
merely	16
by	16
being	16
good,	16
but	16
by	16
letting	16
it	16
be	16
seen	16
that	16
she	16
is	16
so,	16
and	16
open	16
looseness	16
and	16
freedom	16
do	16
much	16
more	16
damage	16
to	16
a	16
woman’s	16
honour	16
than	16
secret	16
depravity.	16
If	16
you	16
take	16
a	16
good	16
woman	16
into	16
your	16
house	16
it	16
will	16
be	16
an	16
easy	16
matter	16
to	16
keep	16
her	16
good,	16
and	16
even	16
to	16
make	16
her	16
still	16
better;	16
but	16
if	16
you	16
take	16
a	16
bad	16
one	16
you	16
will	16
find	16
it	16
hard	16
work	16
to	16
mend	16
her,	16
for	16
it	16
is	16
no	16
very	16
easy	16
matter	16
to	16
pass	16
from	16
one	16
extreme	16
to	16
another.	16
I	16
do	16
not	16
say	16
it	16
is	16
impossible,	16
but	16
I	16
look	16
upon	16
it	16
as	16
difficult.”	16
Sancho,	16
listening	16
to	16
all	16
this,	16
said	16
to	16
himself,	16
“This	16
master	16
of	16
mine,	16
when	16
I	16
say	16
anything	16
that	16
has	16
weight	16
and	16
substance,	16
says	16
I	16
might	16
take	16
a	16
pulpit	16
in	16
hand,	16
and	16
go	16
about	16
the	16
world	16
preaching	16
fine	16
sermons;	16
but	16
I	16
say	16
of	16
him	16
that,	16
when	16
he	16
begins	16
stringing	16
maxims	16
together	16
and	16
giving	16
advice	16
not	16
only	16
might	16
he	16
take	16
a	16
pulpit	16
in	16
hand,	16
but	16
two	16
on	16
each	16
finger,	16
and	16
go	16
into	16
the	16
market-places	16
to	16
his	16
heart’s	16
content.	16
Devil	16
take	16
you	16
for	16
a	16
knight-errant,	16
what	16
a	16
lot	16
of	16
things	16
you	16
know!	16
I	16
used	16
to	16
think	16
in	16
my	16
heart	16
that	16
the	16
only	16
thing	16
he	16
knew	16
was	16
what	16
belonged	16
to	16
his	16
chivalry;	16
but	16
there	16
is	16
nothing	16
he	16
won’t	16
have	16
a	16
finger	16
in.”	16
Sancho	16
muttered	16
this	16
somewhat	16
aloud,	16
and	16
his	16
master	16
overheard	16
him,	16
and	16
asked,	16
“What	16
art	16
thou	16
muttering	16
there,	16
Sancho?”	16
“I’m	16
not	16
saying	16
anything	16
or	16
muttering	16
anything,”	16
said	16
Sancho;	16
“I	16
was	16
only	16
saying	16
to	16
myself	16
that	16
I	16
wish	16
I	16
had	16
heard	16
what	16
your	16
worship	16
has	16
said	16
just	16
now	16
before	16
I	16
married;	16
perhaps	16
I’d	16
say	16
now,	16
‘The	16
ox	16
that’s	16
loose	16
licks	16
himself	16
well.’”	16
“Is	16
thy	16
Teresa	16
so	16
bad	16
then,	16
Sancho?”	16
“She	16
is	16
not	16
very	16
bad,”	16
replied	16
Sancho;	16
“but	16
she	16
is	16
not	16
very	16
good;	16
at	16
least	16
she	16
is	16
not	16
as	16
good	16
as	16
I	16
could	16
wish.”	16
“Thou	16
dost	16
wrong,	16
Sancho,”	16
said	16
Don	16
Quixote,	16
“to	16
speak	16
ill	16
of	16
thy	16
wife;	16
for	16
after	16
all	16
she	16
is	16
the	16
mother	16
of	16
thy	16
children.”	16
“We	16
are	16
quits,”	16
returned	16
Sancho;	16
“for	16
she	16
speaks	16
ill	16
of	16
me	16
whenever	16
she	16
takes	16
it	16
into	16
her	16
head,	16
especially	16
when	16
she	16
is	16
jealous;	16
and	16
Satan	16
himself	16
could	16
not	16
put	16
up	16
with	16
her	16
then.”	16
In	16
fine,	16
they	16
remained	16
three	16
days	16
with	16
the	16
newly	16
married	16
couple,	16
by	16
whom	16
they	16
were	16
entertained	16
and	16
treated	16
like	16
kings.	16
Don	16
Quixote	16
begged	16
the	16
fencing	16
licentiate	16
to	16
find	16
him	16
a	16
guide	16
to	16
show	16
him	16
the	16
way	16
to	16
the	16
cave	16
of	16
Montesinos,	16
as	16
he	16
had	16
a	16
great	16
desire	16
to	16
enter	16
it	16
and	16
see	16
with	16
his	16
own	16
eyes	16
if	16
the	16
wonderful	16
tales	16
that	16
were	16
told	16
of	16
it	16
all	16
over	16
the	16
country	16
were	16
true.	16
The	16
licentiate	16
said	16
he	16
would	16
get	16
him	16
a	16
cousin	16
of	16
his	16
own,	16
a	16
famous	16
scholar,	16
and	16
one	16
very	16
much	16
given	16
to	16
reading	16
books	16
of	16
chivalry,	16
who	16
would	16
have	16
great	16
pleasure	16
in	16
conducting	16
him	16
to	16
the	16
mouth	16
of	16
the	16
very	16
cave,	16
and	16
would	16
show	16
him	16
the	16
lakes	16
of	16
Ruidera,	16
which	16
were	16
likewise	16
famous	16
all	16
over	16
La	16
Mancha,	16
and	16
even	16
all	16
over	16
Spain;	16
and	16
he	16
assured	16
him	16
he	16
would	16
find	16
him	16
entertaining,	16
for	16
he	16
was	16
a	16
youth	16
who	16
could	16
write	16
books	16
good	16
enough	16
to	16
be	16
printed	16
and	16
dedicated	16
to	16
princes.	16
The	16
cousin	16
arrived	16
at	16
last,	16
leading	16
an	16
ass	16
in	16
foal,	16
with	16
a	16
pack-saddle	16
covered	16
with	16
a	16
parti-coloured	16
carpet	16
or	16
sackcloth;	16
Sancho	16
saddled	16
Rocinante,	16
got	16
Dapple	16
ready,	16
and	16
stocked	16
his	16
alforjas,	16
along	16
with	16
which	16
went	16
those	16
of	16
the	16
cousin,	16
likewise	16
well	16
filled;	16
and	16
so,	16
commending	16
themselves	16
to	16
God	16
and	16
bidding	16
farewell	16
to	16
all,	16
they	16
set	16
out,	16
taking	16
the	16
road	16
for	16
the	16
famous	16
cave	16
of	16
Montesinos.	16
On	16
the	16
way	16
Don	16
Quixote	16
asked	16
the	16
cousin	16
of	16
what	16
sort	16
and	16
character	16
his	16
pursuits,	16
avocations,	16
and	16
studies	16
were,	16
to	16
which	16
he	16
replied	16
that	16
he	16
was	16
by	16
profession	16
a	16
humanist,	16
and	16
that	16
his	16
pursuits	16
and	16
studies	16
were	16
making	16
books	16
for	16
the	16
press,	16
all	16
of	16
great	16
utility	16
and	16
no	16
less	16
entertainment	16
to	16
the	16
nation.	16
One	16
was	16
called	16
“The	16
Book	16
of	16
Liveries,”	16
in	16
which	16
he	16
described	16
seven	16
hundred	16
and	16
three	16
liveries,	16
with	16
their	16
colours,	16
mottoes,	16
and	16
ciphers,	16
from	16
which	16
gentlemen	16
of	16
the	16
court	16
might	16
pick	16
and	16
choose	16
any	16
they	16
fancied	16
for	16
festivals	16
and	16
revels,	16
without	16
having	16
to	16
go	16
a-begging	16
for	16
them	16
from	16
anyone,	16
or	16
puzzling	16
their	16
brains,	16
as	16
the	16
saying	16
is,	16
to	16
have	16
them	16
appropriate	16
to	16
their	16
objects	16
and	16
purposes;	16
“for,”	16
said	16
he,	16
“I	16
give	16
the	16
jealous,	16
the	16
rejected,	16
the	16
forgotten,	16
the	16
absent,	16
what	16
will	16
suit	16
them,	16
and	16
fit	16
them	16
without	16
fail.	16
I	16
have	16
another	16
book,	16
too,	16
which	16
I	16
shall	16
call	16
‘Metamorphoses,	16
or	16
the	16
Spanish	16
Ovid,’	16
one	16
of	16
rare	16
and	16
original	16
invention,	16
for	16
imitating	16
Ovid	16
in	16
burlesque	16
style,	16
I	16
show	16
in	16
it	16
who	16
the	16
Giralda	16
of	16
Seville	16
and	16
the	16
Angel	16
of	16
the	16
Magdalena	16
were,	16
what	16
the	16
sewer	16
of	16
Vecinguerra	16
at	16
Cordova	16
was,	16
what	16
the	16
bulls	16
of	16
Guisando,	16
the	16
Sierra	16
Morena,	16
the	16
Leganitos	16
and	16
Lavapies	16
fountains	16
at	16
Madrid,	16
not	16
forgetting	16
those	16
of	16
the	16
Piojo,	16
of	16
the	16
Cano	16
Dorado,	16
and	16
of	16
the	16
Priora;	16
and	16
all	16
with	16
their	16
allegories,	16
metaphors,	16
and	16
changes,	16
so	16
that	16
they	16
are	16
amusing,	16
interesting,	16
and	16
instructive,	16
all	16
at	16
once.	16
Another	16
book	16
I	16
have	16
which	16
I	16
call	16
‘The	16
Supplement	16
to	16
Polydore	16
Vergil,’	16
which	16
treats	16
of	16
the	16
invention	16
of	16
things,	16
and	16
is	16
a	16
work	16
of	16
great	16
erudition	16
and	16
research,	16
for	16
I	16
establish	16
and	16
elucidate	16
elegantly	16
some	16
things	16
of	16
great	16
importance	16
which	16
Polydore	16
omitted	16
to	16
mention.	16
He	16
forgot	16
to	16
tell	16
us	16
who	16
was	16
the	16
first	16
man	16
in	16
the	16
world	16
that	16
had	16
a	16
cold	16
in	16
his	16
head,	16
and	16
who	16
was	16
the	16
first	16
to	16
try	16
salivation	16
for	16
the	16
French	16
disease,	16
but	16
I	16
give	16
it	16
accurately	16
set	16
forth,	16
and	16
quote	16
more	16
than	16
five-and-twenty	16
authors	16
in	16
proof	16
of	16
it,	16
so	16
you	16
may	16
perceive	16
I	16
have	16
laboured	16
to	16
good	16
purpose	16
and	16
that	16
the	16
book	16
will	16
be	16
of	16
service	16
to	16
the	16
whole	16
world.”	16
Sancho,	16
who	16
had	16
been	16
very	16
attentive	16
to	16
the	16
cousin’s	16
words,	16
said	16
to	16
him,	16
“Tell	16
me,	16
señor—and	16
God	16
give	16
you	16
luck	16
in	16
printing	16
your	16
books—can	16
you	16
tell	16
me	16
(for	16
of	16
course	16
you	16
know,	16
as	16
you	16
know	16
everything)	16
who	16
was	16
the	16
first	16
man	16
that	16
scratched	16
his	16
head?	16
For	16
to	16
my	16
thinking	16
it	16
must	16
have	16
been	16
our	16
father	16
Adam.”	16
“So	16
it	16
must,”	16
replied	16
the	16
cousin;	16
“for	16
there	16
is	16
no	16
doubt	16
but	16
Adam	16
had	16
a	16
head	16
and	16
hair;	16
and	16
being	16
the	16
first	16
man	16
in	16
the	16
world	16
he	16
would	16
have	16
scratched	16
himself	16
sometimes.”	16
“So	16
I	16
think,”	16
said	16
Sancho;	16
“but	16
now	16
tell	16
me,	16
who	16
was	16
the	16
first	16
tumbler	16
in	16
the	16
world?”	16
“Really,	16
brother,”	16
answered	16
the	16
cousin,	16
“I	16
could	16
not	16
at	16
this	16
moment	16
say	16
positively	16
without	16
having	16
investigated	16
it;	16
I	16
will	16
look	16
it	16
up	16
when	16
I	16
go	16
back	16
to	16
where	16
I	16
have	16
my	16
books,	16
and	16
will	16
satisfy	16
you	16
the	16
next	16
time	16
we	16
meet,	16
for	16
this	16
will	16
not	16
be	16
the	16
last	16
time.”	16
“Look	16
here,	16
señor,”	16
said	16
Sancho,	16
“don’t	16
give	16
yourself	16
any	16
trouble	16
about	16
it,	16
for	16
I	16
have	16
just	16
this	16
minute	16
hit	16
upon	16
what	16
I	16
asked	16
you.	16
The	16
first	16
tumbler	16
in	16
the	16
world,	16
you	16
must	16
know,	16
was	16
Lucifer,	16
when	16
they	16
cast	16
or	16
pitched	16
him	16
out	16
of	16
heaven;	16
for	16
he	16
came	16
tumbling	16
into	16
the	16
bottomless	16
pit.”	16
“You	16
are	16
right,	16
friend,”	16
said	16
the	16
cousin;	16
and	16
said	16
Don	16
Quixote,	16
“Sancho,	16
that	16
question	16
and	16
answer	16
are	16
not	16
thine	16
own;	16
thou	16
hast	16
heard	16
them	16
from	16
someone	16
else.”	16
“Hold	16
your	16
peace,	16
señor,”	16
said	16
Sancho;	16
“faith,	16
if	16
I	16
take	16
to	16
asking	16
questions	16
and	16
answering,	16
I’ll	16
go	16
on	16
from	16
this	16
till	16
to-morrow	16
morning.	16
Nay!	16
to	16
ask	16
foolish	16
things	16
and	16
answer	16
nonsense	16
I	16
needn’t	16
go	16
looking	16
for	16
help	16
from	16
my	16
neighbours.”	16
“Thou	16
hast	16
said	16
more	16
than	16
thou	16
art	16
aware	16
of,	16
Sancho,”	16
said	16
Don	16
Quixote;	16
“for	16
there	16
are	16
some	16
who	16
weary	16
themselves	16
out	16
in	16
learning	16
and	16
proving	16
things	16
that,	16
after	16
they	16
are	16
known	16
and	16
proved,	16
are	16
not	16
worth	16
a	16
farthing	16
to	16
the	16
understanding	16
or	16
memory.”	16
In	16
this	16
and	16
other	16
pleasant	16
conversation	16
the	16
day	16
went	16
by,	16
and	16
that	16
night	16
they	16
put	16
up	16
at	16
a	16
small	16
hamlet	16
whence	16
it	16
was	16
not	16
more	16
than	16
two	16
leagues	16
to	16
the	16
cave	16
of	16
Montesinos,	16
so	16
the	16
cousin	16
told	16
Don	16
Quixote,	16
adding,	16
that	16
if	16
he	16
was	16
bent	16
upon	16
entering	16
it,	16
it	16
would	16
be	16
requisite	16
for	16
him	16
to	16
provide	16
himself	16
with	16
ropes,	16
so	16
that	16
he	16
might	16
be	16
tied	16
and	16
lowered	16
into	16
its	16
depths.	16
Don	16
Quixote	16
said	16
that	16
even	16
if	16
it	16
reached	16
to	16
the	16
bottomless	16
pit	16
he	16
meant	16
to	16
see	16
where	16
it	16
went	16
to;	16
so	16
they	16
bought	16
about	16
a	16
hundred	16
fathoms	16
of	16
rope,	16
and	16
next	16
day	16
at	16
two	16
in	16
the	16
afternoon	16
they	16
arrived	16
at	16
the	16
cave,	16
the	16
mouth	16
of	16
which	16
is	16
spacious	16
and	16
wide,	16
but	16
full	16
of	16
thorn	16
and	16
wild-fig	16
bushes	16
and	16
brambles	16
and	16
briars,	16
so	16
thick	16
and	16
matted	16
that	16
they	16
completely	16
close	16
it	16
up	16
and	16
cover	16
it	16
over.	16
On	16
coming	16
within	16
sight	16
of	16
it	16
the	16
cousin,	16
Sancho,	16
and	16
Don	16
Quixote	16
dismounted,	16
and	16
the	16
first	16
two	16
immediately	16
tied	16
the	16
latter	16
very	16
firmly	16
with	16
the	16
ropes,	16
and	16
as	16
they	16
were	16
girding	16
and	16
swathing	16
him	16
Sancho	16
said	16
to	16
him,	16
“Mind	16
what	16
you	16
are	16
about,	16
master	16
mine;	16
don’t	16
go	16
burying	16
yourself	16
alive,	16
or	16
putting	16
yourself	16
where	16
you’ll	16
be	16
like	16
a	16
bottle	16
put	16
to	16
cool	16
in	16
a	16
well;	16
it’s	16
no	16
affair	16
or	16
business	16
of	16
your	16
worship’s	16
to	16
become	16
the	16
explorer	16
of	16
this,	16
which	16
must	16
be	16
worse	16
than	16
a	16
Moorish	16
dungeon.”	16
“Tie	16
me	16
and	16
hold	16
thy	16
peace,”	16
said	16
Don	16
Quixote,	16
“for	16
an	16
emprise	16
like	16
this,	16
friend	16
Sancho,	16
was	16
reserved	16
for	16
me;”	16
and	16
said	16
the	16
guide,	16
“I	16
beg	16
of	16
you,	16
Señor	16
Don	16
Quixote,	16
to	16
observe	16
carefully	16
and	16
examine	16
with	16
a	16
hundred	16
eyes	16
everything	16
that	16
is	16
within	16
there;	16
perhaps	16
there	16
may	16
be	16
some	16
things	16
for	16
me	16
to	16
put	16
into	16
my	16
book	16
of	16
‘Transformations.’”	16
“The	16
drum	16
is	16
in	16
hands	16
that	16
will	16
know	16
how	16
to	16
beat	16
it	16
well	16
enough,”	16
said	16
Sancho	16
Panza.	16
When	16
he	16
had	16
said	16
this	16
and	16
finished	16
the	16
tying	16
(which	16
was	16
not	16
over	16
the	16
armour	16
but	16
only	16
over	16
the	16
doublet)	16
Don	16
Quixote	16
observed,	16
“It	16
was	16
careless	16
of	16
us	16
not	16
to	16
have	16
provided	16
ourselves	16
with	16
a	16
small	16
cattle-bell	16
to	16
be	16
tied	16
on	16
the	16
rope	16
close	16
to	16
me,	16
the	16
sound	16
of	16
which	16
would	16
show	16
that	16
I	16
was	16
still	16
descending	16
and	16
alive;	16
but	16
as	16
that	16
is	16
out	16
of	16
the	16
question	16
now,	16
in	16
God’s	16
hand	16
be	16
it	16
to	16
guide	16
me;”	16
and	16
forthwith	16
he	16
fell	16
on	16
his	16
knees	16
and	16
in	16
a	16
low	16
voice	16
offered	16
up	16
a	16
prayer	16
to	16
heaven,	16
imploring	16
God	16
to	16
aid	16
him	16
and	16
grant	16
him	16
success	16
in	16
this	16
to	16
all	16
appearance	16
perilous	16
and	16
untried	16
adventure,	16
and	16
then	16
exclaimed	16
aloud,	16
“O	16
mistress	16
of	16
my	16
actions	16
and	16
movements,	16
illustrious	16
and	16
peerless	16
Dulcinea	16
del	16
Toboso,	16
if	16
so	16
be	16
the	16
prayers	16
and	16
supplications	16
of	16
this	16
fortunate	16
lover	16
can	16
reach	16
thy	16
ears,	16
by	16
thy	16
incomparable	16
beauty	16
I	16
entreat	16
thee	16
to	16
listen	16
to	16
them,	16
for	16
they	16
but	16
ask	16
thee	16
not	16
to	16
refuse	16
me	16
thy	16
favour	16
and	16
protection	16
now	16
that	16
I	16
stand	16
in	16
such	16
need	16
of	16
them.	16
I	16
am	16
about	16
to	16
precipitate,	16
to	16
sink,	16
to	16
plunge	16
myself	16
into	16
the	16
abyss	16
that	16
is	16
here	16
before	16
me,	16
only	16
to	16
let	16
the	16
world	16
know	16
that	16
while	16
thou	16
dost	16
favour	16
me	16
there	16
is	16
no	16
impossibility	16
I	16
will	16
not	16
attempt	16
and	16
accomplish.”	16
With	16
these	16
words	16
he	16
approached	16
the	16
cavern,	16
and	16
perceived	16
that	16
it	16
was	16
impossible	16
to	16
let	16
himself	16
down	16
or	16
effect	16
an	16
entrance	16
except	16
by	16
sheer	16
force	16
or	16
cleaving	16
a	16
passage;	16
so	16
drawing	16
his	16
sword	16
he	16
began	16
to	16
demolish	16
and	16
cut	16
away	16
the	16
brambles	16
at	16
the	16
mouth	16
of	16
the	16
cave,	16
at	16
the	16
noise	16
of	16
which	16
a	16
vast	16
multitude	16
of	16
crows	16
and	16
choughs	16
flew	16
out	16
of	16
it	16
so	16
thick	16
and	16
so	16
fast	16
that	16
they	16
knocked	16
Don	16
Quixote	16
down;	16
and	16
if	16
he	16
had	16
been	16
as	16
much	16
of	16
a	16
believer	16
in	16
augury	16
as	16
he	16
was	16
a	16
Catholic	16
Christian	16
he	16
would	16
have	16
taken	16
it	16
as	16
a	16
bad	16
omen	16
and	16
declined	16
to	16
bury	16
himself	16
in	16
such	16
a	16
place.	16
He	16
got	16
up,	16
however,	16
and	16
as	16
there	16
came	16
no	16
more	16
crows,	16
or	16
night-birds	16
like	16
the	16
bats	16
that	16
flew	16
out	16
at	16
the	16
same	16
time	16
with	16
the	16
crows,	16
the	16
cousin	16
and	16
Sancho	16
giving	16
him	16
rope,	16
he	16
lowered	16
himself	16
into	16
the	16
depths	16
of	16
the	16
dread	16
cavern;	16
and	16
as	16
he	16
entered	16
it	16
Sancho	16
sent	16
his	16
blessing	16
after	16
him,	16
making	16
a	16
thousand	16
crosses	16
over	16
him	16
and	16
saying,	16
“God,	16
and	16
the	16
Peña	16
de	16
Francia,	16
and	16
the	16
Trinity	16
of	16
Gaeta	16
guide	16
thee,	16
flower	16
and	16
cream	16
of	16
knights-errant.	16
There	16
thou	16
goest,	16
thou	16
dare-devil	16
of	16
the	16
earth,	16
heart	16
of	16
steel,	16
arm	16
of	16
brass;	16
once	16
more,	16
God	16
guide	16
thee	16
and	16
send	16
thee	16
back	16
safe,	16
sound,	16
and	16
unhurt	16
to	16
the	16
light	16
of	16
this	16
world	16
thou	16
art	16
leaving	16
to	16
bury	16
thyself	16
in	16
the	16
darkness	16
thou	16
art	16
seeking	16
there;”	16
and	16
the	16
cousin	16
offered	16
up	16
almost	16
the	16
same	16
prayers	16
and	16
supplications.	16

Don	16
Quixote	16
kept	16
calling	16
to	16
them	16
to	16
give	16
him	16
rope	16
and	16
more	16
rope,	16
and	16
they	16
gave	16
it	16
out	16
little	16
by	16
little,	16
and	16
by	16
the	16
time	16
the	16
calls,	16
which	16
came	16
out	16
of	16
the	16
cave	16
as	16
out	16
of	16
a	16
pipe,	16
ceased	16
to	16
be	16
heard	16
they	16
had	16
let	16
down	16
the	16
hundred	16
fathoms	16
of	16
rope.	16
They	16
were	16
inclined	16
to	16
pull	16
Don	16
Quixote	16
up	16
again,	16
as	16
they	16
could	16
give	16
him	16
no	16
more	16
rope;	16
however,	16
they	16
waited	16
about	16
half	16
an	16
hour,	16
at	16
the	16
end	16
of	16
which	16
time	16
they	16
began	16
to	16
gather	16
in	16
the	16
rope	16
again	16
with	16
great	16
ease	16
and	16
without	16
feeling	16
any	16
weight,	16
which	16
made	16
them	16
fancy	16
Don	16
Quixote	16
was	16
remaining	16
below;	16
and	16
persuaded	16
that	16
it	16
was	16
so,	16
Sancho	16
wept	16
bitterly,	16
and	16
hauled	16
away	16
in	16
great	16
haste	16
in	16
order	16
to	16
settle	16
the	16
question.	16
When,	16
however,	16
they	16
had	16
come	16
to,	16
as	16
it	16
seemed,	16
rather	16
more	16
than	16
eighty	16
fathoms	16
they	16
felt	16
a	16
weight,	16
at	16
which	16
they	16
were	16
greatly	16
delighted;	16
and	16
at	16
last,	16
at	16
ten	16
fathoms	16
more,	16
they	16
saw	16
Don	16
Quixote	16
distinctly,	16
and	16
Sancho	16
called	16
out	16
to	16
him,	16
saying,	16
“Welcome	16
back,	16
señor,	16
for	16
we	16
had	16
begun	16
to	16
think	16
you	16
were	16
going	16
to	16
stop	16
there	16
to	16
found	16
a	16
family.”	16
But	16
Don	16
Quixote	16
answered	16
not	16
a	16
word,	16
and	16
drawing	16
him	16
out	16
entirely	16
they	16
perceived	16
he	16
had	16
his	16
eyes	16
shut	16
and	16
every	16
appearance	16
of	16
being	16
fast	16
asleep.	16
They	16
stretched	16
him	16
on	16
the	16
ground	16
and	16
untied	16
him,	16
but	16
still	16
he	16
did	16
not	16
awake;	16
however,	16
they	16
rolled	16
him	16
back	16
and	16
forwards	16
and	16
shook	16
and	16
pulled	16
him	16
about,	16
so	16
that	16
after	16
some	16
time	16
he	16
came	16
to	16
himself,	16
stretching	16
himself	16
just	16
as	16
if	16
he	16
were	16
waking	16
up	16
from	16
a	16
deep	16
and	16
sound	16
sleep,	16
and	16
looking	16
about	16
him	16
he	16
said,	16
“God	16
forgive	16
you,	16
friends;	16
ye	16
have	16
taken	16
me	16
away	16
from	16
the	16

existence	16

ever	16

Now	16

The	16
cousin	16
and	16
Sancho	16
Panza	16
listened	16
with	16
deep	16
attention	16
to	16
the	16
words	16
of	16
Don	16
Quixote,	16
who	16
uttered	16
them	16
as	16
though	16
with	16
immense	16
pain	16
he	16
drew	16
them	16
up	16
from	16
his	16
very	16
bowels.	16
They	16
begged	16
of	16
him	16
to	16
explain	16
himself,	16
and	16
tell	16
them	16
what	16
he	16
had	16
seen	16
in	16
that	16
hell	16
down	16
there.	16
“Hell	16
do	16
you	16
call	16
it?”	16
said	16
Don	16
Quixote;	16
“call	16
it	16
by	16
no	16
such	16
name,	16
for	16
it	16
does	16
not	16
deserve	16
it,	16

He	16
then	16
begged	16
them	16
to	16
give	16
him	16
something	16
to	16
eat,	16
as	16
he	16
was	16
very	16
hungry.	16
They	16
spread	16
the	16
cousin’s	16
sackcloth	16
on	16
the	16
grass,	16
and	16
put	16
the	16
stores	16
of	16
the	16
alforjas	16
into	16
requisition,	16
and	16
all	16
three	16
sitting	16
down	16
lovingly	16

sociably,	16
they	16
made	16
a	16

a	16
supper	16
of	16
it	16
all	16

when	16
the	16

removed,	16
Don	16
Quixote	16

light	16
and	16
tempered	16
beams,	16
enabled	16
Don	16
Quixote	16
to	16
relate,	16
without	16
heat	16
or	16
inconvenience,	16
what	16
he	16
had	16
seen	16
in	16
the	16
cave	16
of	16
Montesinos	16
to	16
his	16
two	16
illustrious	16
hearers,	16
and	16
he	16
began	16
as	16
follows:	16
“A	16
matter	16
of	16
some	16
twelve	16
or	16
fourteen	16
times	16
a	16
man’s	16
height	16
down	16
in	16
this	16
pit,	16
on	16
the	16
right-hand	16
side,	16
there	16
is	16
a	16
recess	16
or	16
space,	16
roomy	16
enough	16
to	16
contain	16
a	16
large	16
cart	16
with	16
its	16
mules.	16
A	16
little	16
light	16
reaches	16
it	16
through	16
some	16
chinks	16
or	16
crevices,	16
communicating	16
with	16
it	16
and	16
open	16
to	16
the	16
surface	16
of	16
the	16
earth.	16
This	16
recess	16
or	16
space	16
I	16
perceived	16
when	16
I	16
was	16
already	16
growing	16
weary	16
and	16
disgusted	16
at	16
finding	16
myself	16
hanging	16
suspended	16
by	16
the	16
rope,	16
travelling	16
downwards	16
into	16
that	16
dark	16
region	16
without	16
any	16
certainty	16
or	16
knowledge	16
of	16
where	16
I	16
was	16
going,	16
so	16
I	16
resolved	16
to	16
enter	16
it	16
and	16
rest	16
myself	16
for	16
a	16
while.	16
I	16
called	16
out,	16
telling	16
you	16
not	16
to	16
let	16
out	16
more	16
rope	16
until	16
I	16
bade	16
you,	16
but	16
you	16
cannot	16
have	16
heard	16
me.	16
I	16
then	16
gathered	16
in	16
the	16
rope	16
you	16
were	16
sending	16
me,	16
and	16
making	16
a	16
coil	16
or	16
pile	16
of	16
it	16
I	16
seated	16
myself	16
upon	16
it,	16
ruminating	16
and	16
considering	16
what	16
I	16
was	16
to	16
do	16
to	16
lower	16
myself	16
to	16
the	16
bottom,	16
having	16
no	16
one	16
to	16
hold	16
me	16
up;	16
and	16
as	16
I	16
was	16
thus	16
deep	16
in	16
thought	16
and	16
perplexity,	16
suddenly	16
and	16
without	16
provocation	16
a	16
profound	16
sleep	16
fell	16
upon	16
me,	16
and	16
when	16
I	16
least	16
expected	16
it,	16
I	16
know	16
not	16
how,	16
I	16
awoke	16
and	16
found	16
myself	16
in	16
the	16
midst	16
of	16
the	16
most	16
beautiful,	16
delightful	16
meadow	16
that	16
nature	16
could	16
produce	16
or	16
the	16
most	16
lively	16
human	16
imagination	16
conceive.	16
I	16
opened	16
my	16
eyes,	16
I	16
rubbed	16
them,	16
and	16
found	16
I	16
was	16
not	16
asleep	16
but	16
thoroughly	16
awake.	16
Nevertheless,	16
I	16
felt	16
my	16
head	16
and	16
breast	16
to	16
satisfy	16
myself	16
whether	16
it	16
was	16
I	16
myself	16
who	16
was	16
there	16
or	16
some	16
empty	16
delusive	16
phantom;	16
but	16
touch,	16
feeling,	16
the	16
collected	16
thoughts	16
that	16
passed	16
through	16
my	16
mind,	16
all	16
convinced	16
me	16
that	16
I	16
was	16
the	16
same	16
then	16
and	16
there	16
that	16
I	16
am	16
this	16
moment.	16
Next	16
there	16
presented	16
itself	16
to	16
my	16
sight	16
a	16
stately	16
royal	16
palace	16
or	16
castle,	16
with	16
walls	16
that	16
seemed	16
built	16
of	16
clear	16
transparent	16
crystal;	16
and	16
through	16
two	16
great	16
doors	16
that	16
opened	16
wide	16
therein,	16
I	16
saw	16
coming	16
forth	16
and	16
advancing	16
towards	16
me	16
a	16
venerable	16
old	16
man,	16
clad	16
in	16
a	16
long	16
gown	16
of	16
mulberry-coloured	16
serge	16
that	16
trailed	16
upon	16
the	16
ground.	16
On	16
his	16
shoulders	16
and	16
breast	16
he	16
had	16
a	16
green	16
satin	16
collegiate	16
hood,	16
and	16
covering	16
his	16
head	16
a	16
black	16
Milanese	16
bonnet,	16
and	16
his	16
snow-white	16
beard	16
fell	16
below	16
his	16
girdle.	16
He	16
carried	16
no	16
arms	16
whatever,	16
nothing	16
but	16
a	16
rosary	16
of	16
beads	16
bigger	16
than	16
fair-sized	16
filberts,	16
each	16
tenth	16
bead	16
being	16
like	16
a	16
moderate	16
ostrich	16
egg;	16
his	16
bearing,	16
his	16
gait,	16
his	16
dignity	16
and	16
imposing	16
presence	16
held	16
me	16
spellbound	16
and	16
wondering.	16
He	16
approached	16
me,	16
and	16
the	16
first	16
thing	16
he	16
did	16
was	16
to	16
embrace	16
me	16
closely,	16
and	16
then	16
he	16
said	16
to	16
me,	16
‘For	16
a	16
long	16
time	16
now,	16
O	16
valiant	16
knight	16
Don	16
Quixote	16
of	16
La	16
Mancha,	16
we	16
who	16
are	16
here	16
enchanted	16
in	16
these	16
solitudes	16
have	16
been	16
hoping	16
to	16
see	16
thee,	16
that	16
thou	16
mayest	16
make	16
known	16
to	16
the	16
world	16
what	16
is	16
shut	16
up	16
and	16
concealed	16
in	16
this	16
deep	16
cave,	16
called	16
the	16
cave	16
of	16
Montesinos,	16
which	16
thou	16
hast	16
entered,	16
an	16
achievement	16
reserved	16
for	16
thy	16
invincible	16
heart	16
and	16
stupendous	16
courage	16
alone	16
to	16
attempt.	16
Come	16
with	16
me,	16
illustrious	16
sir,	16
and	16
I	16
will	16
show	16
thee	16
the	16
marvels	16
hidden	16
within	16
this	16
transparent	16
castle,	16
whereof	16
I	16
am	16
the	16
alcaide	16
and	16
perpetual	16
warden;	16
for	16
I	16
am	16
Montesinos	16
himself,	16
from	16
whom	16
the	16
cave	16
takes	16
its	16
name.’	16
“The	16
instant	16
he	16
told	16
me	16
he	16
was	16
Montesinos,	16
I	16
asked	16
him	16
if	16
the	16
story	16
they	16
told	16
in	16
the	16
world	16
above	16
here	16
was	16
true,	16
that	16
he	16
had	16
taken	16
out	16
the	16
heart	16
of	16
his	16
great	16
friend	16
Durandarte	16
from	16
his	16
breast	16
with	16
a	16
little	16
dagger,	16
and	16
carried	16
it	16
to	16
the	16
lady	16
Belerma,	16
as	16
his	16
friend	16
when	16
at	16
the	16
point	16
of	16
death	16
had	16
commanded	16
him.	16
He	16
said	16
in	16
reply	16
that	16
they	16
spoke	16
the	16
truth	16
in	16
every	16
respect	16
except	16
as	16
to	16
the	16
dagger,	16
for	16
it	16
was	16
not	16
a	16
dagger,	16
nor	16
little,	16
but	16
a	16
burnished	16
poniard	16
sharper	16
than	16
an	16
awl.”	16
“That	16
poniard	16
must	16
have	16
been	16
made	16
by	16
Ramon	16
de	16
Hoces	16
the	16
Sevillian,”	16
said	16
Sancho.	16
“I	16
do	16
not	16
know,”	16
said	16
Don	16
Quixote;	16
“it	16
could	16
not	16
have	16
been	16
by	16
that	16
poniard	16
maker,	16
however,	16
because	16
Ramon	16
de	16
Hoces	16
was	16
a	16
man	16
of	16
yesterday,	16
and	16
the	16
affair	16
of	16
Roncesvalles,	16
where	16
this	16
mishap	16
occurred,	16
was	16
long	16
ago;	16
but	16
the	16
question	16
is	16
of	16
no	16
great	16
importance,	16
nor	16
does	16
it	16
affect	16
or	16
make	16
any	16
alteration	16
in	16
the	16
truth	16
or	16
substance	16
of	16
the	16
story.”	16
“That	16
is	16
true,”	16
said	16
the	16
cousin;	16
“continue,	16
Señor	16
Don	16
Quixote,	16
for	16
I	16
am	16
listening	16
to	16
you	16
with	16
the	16
greatest	16
pleasure	16
in	16
the	16
world.”	16
“And	16
with	16
no	16
less	16
do	16
I	16
tell	16
the	16
tale,”	16
said	16
Don	16
Quixote;	16
“and	16
so,	16
to	16
proceed—the	16
venerable	16
Montesinos	16
led	16
me	16
into	16
the	16
palace	16
of	16
crystal,	16
where,	16
in	16
a	16
lower	16
chamber,	16
strangely	16
cool	16
and	16
entirely	16
of	16
alabaster,	16
was	16
an	16
elaborately	16
wrought	16
marble	16
tomb,	16
upon	16
which	16
I	16
beheld,	16
stretched	16
at	16
full	16
length,	16
a	16
knight,	16
not	16
of	16
bronze,	16
or	16
marble,	16
or	16
jasper,	16
as	16
are	16
seen	16
on	16
other	16
tombs,	16
but	16
of	16
actual	16
flesh	16
and	16
bone.	16
His	16
right	16
hand	16
(which	16
seemed	16
to	16
me	16
somewhat	16
hairy	16
and	16
sinewy,	16
a	16
sign	16
of	16
great	16
strength	16
in	16
its	16
owner)	16
lay	16
on	16
the	16
side	16
of	16
his	16
heart;	16
but	16
before	16
I	16
could	16
put	16
any	16
question	16
to	16
Montesinos,	16
he,	16
seeing	16
me	16
gazing	16
at	16
the	16
tomb	16
in	16
amazement,	16
said	16
to	16
me,	16
‘This	16
is	16
my	16
friend	16
Durandarte,	16
flower	16
and	16
mirror	16
of	16
the	16
true	16
lovers	16
and	16
valiant	16
knights	16
of	16
his	16
time.	16
He	16
is	16
held	16
enchanted	16
here,	16
as	16
I	16
myself	16
and	16
many	16
others	16
are,	16
by	16
that	16
French	16
enchanter	16
Merlin,	16
who,	16
they	16
say,	16
was	16
the	16
devil’s	16
son;	16
but	16
my	16
belief	16
is,	16
not	16
that	16
he	16
was	16
the	16
devil’s	16
son,	16
but	16
that	16
he	16
knew,	16
as	16
the	16
saying	16
is,	16
a	16
point	16
more	16
than	16
the	16
devil.	16
How	16
or	16
why	16
he	16
enchanted	16
us,	16
no	16
one	16
knows,	16
but	16
time	16
will	16
tell,	16
and	16
I	16
suspect	16
that	16
time	16
is	16
not	16
far	16
off.	16
What	16
I	16
marvel	16
at	16
is,	16
that	16
I	16
know	16
it	16
to	16
be	16
as	16
sure	16
as	16
that	16
it	16
is	16
now	16
day,	16
that	16
Durandarte	16
ended	16
his	16
life	16
in	16
my	16
arms,	16
and	16
that,	16
after	16
his	16
death,	16
I	16
took	16
out	16
his	16
heart	16
with	16
my	16
own	16
hands;	16
and	16
indeed	16
it	16
must	16
have	16
weighed	16
more	16
than	16
two	16
pounds,	16
for,	16
according	16
to	16
naturalists,	16
he	16
who	16
has	16
a	16
large	16
heart	16
is	16
more	16
largely	16
endowed	16
with	16
valour	16
than	16
he	16
who	16
has	16
a	16
small	16
one.	16
Then,	16
as	16
this	16
is	16
the	16
case,	16
and	16
as	16
the	16
knight	16
did	16
really	16
die,	16
how	16
comes	16
it	16
that	16
he	16
now	16
moans	16
and	16
sighs	16
from	16
time	16
to	16
time,	16
as	16
if	16
he	16
were	16
still	16
alive?’	16

“As	16
he	16
said	16
this,	16
the	16
wretched	16
Durandarte	16
cried	16
out	16
in	16
a	16
loud	16
voice:	16
O	16
cousin	16
Montesinos!	16
’Twas	16
my	16
last	16
request	16
of	16
thee,	16
When	16
my	16
soul	16
hath	16
left	16
the	16
body,	16
And	16
that	16
lying	16
dead	16
I	16
be,	16
With	16
thy	16
poniard	16
or	16
thy	16
dagger	16
Cut	16
the	16
heart	16
from	16
out	16
my	16
breast,	16
And	16
bear	16
it	16
to	16
Belerma.	16
This	16
was	16
my	16
last	16
request.”	16
“On	16
hearing	16
which,	16
the	16
venerable	16
Montesinos	16
fell	16
on	16
his	16
knees	16
before	16
the	16
unhappy	16
knight,	16
and	16
with	16
tearful	16
eyes	16
exclaimed,	16
‘Long	16
since,	16
Señor	16
Durandarte,	16
my	16
beloved	16
cousin,	16
long	16
since	16
have	16
I	16
done	16
what	16
you	16
bade	16
me	16
on	16
that	16
sad	16
day	16
when	16
I	16
lost	16
you;	16
I	16
took	16
out	16
your	16
heart	16
as	16
well	16
as	16
I	16
could,	16
not	16
leaving	16
an	16
atom	16
of	16
it	16
in	16
your	16
breast,	16
I	16
wiped	16
it	16
with	16
a	16
lace	16
handkerchief,	16
and	16
I	16
took	16
the	16
road	16
to	16
France	16
with	16
it,	16
having	16
first	16
laid	16
you	16
in	16
the	16
bosom	16
of	16
the	16
earth	16
with	16
tears	16
enough	16
to	16
wash	16
and	16
cleanse	16
my	16
hands	16
of	16
the	16
blood	16
that	16
covered	16
them	16
after	16
wandering	16
among	16
your	16
bowels;	16
and	16
more	16
by	16
token,	16
O	16
cousin	16
of	16
my	16
soul,	16
at	16
the	16
first	16
village	16
I	16
came	16
to	16
after	16
leaving	16
Roncesvalles,	16
I	16
sprinkled	16
a	16
little	16
salt	16
upon	16
your	16
heart	16
to	16
keep	16
it	16
sweet,	16
and	16
bring	16
it,	16
if	16
not	16
fresh,	16
at	16
least	16
pickled,	16
into	16
the	16
presence	16
of	16
the	16
lady	16
Belerma,	16
whom,	16
together	16
with	16
you,	16
myself,	16
Guadiana	16
your	16
squire,	16
the	16
duenna	16
Ruidera	16
and	16
her	16
seven	16
daughters	16
and	16
two	16
nieces,	16
and	16
many	16
more	16
of	16
your	16
friends	16
and	16
acquaintances,	16
the	16
sage	16
Merlin	16
has	16
been	16
keeping	16
enchanted	16
here	16
these	16
many	16
years;	16
and	16
although	16
more	16
than	16
five	16
hundred	16
have	16
gone	16
by,	16
not	16
one	16
of	16
us	16
has	16
died;	16
Ruidera	16
and	16
her	16
daughters	16
and	16
nieces	16
alone	16
are	16
missing,	16
and	16
these,	16
because	16
of	16
the	16
tears	16
they	16
shed,	16
Merlin,	16
out	16
of	16
the	16
compassion	16
he	16
seems	16
to	16
have	16
felt	16
for	16
them,	16
changed	16
into	16
so	16
many	16
lakes,	16
which	16
to	16
this	16
day	16
in	16
the	16
world	16
of	16
the	16
living,	16
and	16
in	16
the	16
province	16
of	16
La	16
Mancha,	16
are	16
called	16
the	16
Lakes	16
of	16
Ruidera.	16
The	16
seven	16
daughters	16
belong	16
to	16
the	16
kings	16
of	16
Spain	16
and	16
the	16
two	16
nieces	16
to	16
the	16
knights	16
of	16
a	16
very	16
holy	16
order	16
called	16
the	16
Order	16
of	16
St.	16
John.	16
Guadiana	16
your	16
squire,	16
likewise	16
bewailing	16
your	16
fate,	16
was	16
changed	16
into	16
a	16
river	16
of	16
his	16
own	16
name,	16
but	16
when	16
he	16
came	16
to	16
the	16
surface	16
and	16
beheld	16
the	16
sun	16
of	16
another	16
heaven,	16
so	16
great	16
was	16
his	16
grief	16
at	16
finding	16
he	16
was	16
leaving	16
you,	16
that	16
he	16
plunged	16
into	16
the	16
bowels	16
of	16
the	16
earth;	16
however,	16
as	16
he	16
cannot	16
help	16
following	16
his	16
natural	16
course,	16
he	16
from	16
time	16
to	16
time	16
comes	16
forth	16
and	16
shows	16
himself	16
to	16
the	16
sun	16
and	16
the	16
world.	16
The	16
lakes	16
aforesaid	16
send	16
him	16
their	16
waters,	16
and	16
with	16
these,	16
and	16
others	16
that	16
come	16
to	16
him,	16
he	16
makes	16
a	16
grand	16
and	16
imposing	16
entrance	16
into	16
Portugal;	16
but	16
for	16
all	16
that,	16
go	16
where	16
he	16
may,	16
he	16
shows	16
his	16
melancholy	16
and	16
sadness,	16
and	16
takes	16
no	16
pride	16
in	16
breeding	16
dainty	16
choice	16
fish,	16
only	16
coarse	16
and	16
tasteless	16
sorts,	16
very	16
different	16
from	16
those	16
of	16
the	16
golden	16
Tagus.	16
All	16
this	16
that	16
I	16
tell	16
you	16
now,	16
O	16
cousin	16
mine,	16
I	16
have	16
told	16
you	16
many	16
times	16
before,	16
and	16
as	16
you	16
make	16
no	16
answer,	16
I	16
fear	16
that	16
either	16
you	16
believe	16
me	16
not,	16
or	16
do	16
not	16
hear	16
me,	16
whereat	16
I	16
feel	16
God	16
knows	16
what	16
grief.	16
I	16
have	16
now	16
news	16
to	16
give	16
you,	16
which,	16
if	16
it	16
serves	16
not	16
to	16
alleviate	16
your	16
sufferings,	16
will	16
not	16
in	16
any	16
wise	16
increase	16
them.	16
Know	16
that	16
you	16
have	16
here	16
before	16
you	16
(open	16
your	16
eyes	16
and	16
you	16
will	16
see)	16
that	16
great	16
knight	16
of	16
whom	16
the	16
sage	16
Merlin	16
has	16
prophesied	16
such	16
great	16
things;	16
that	16
Don	16
Quixote	16
of	16
La	16
Mancha	16
I	16
mean,	16
who	16
has	16
again,	16
and	16
to	16
better	16
purpose	16
than	16
in	16
past	16
times,	16
revived	16
in	16
these	16
days	16
knight-errantry,	16
long	16
since	16
forgotten,	16
and	16
by	16
whose	16
intervention	16
and	16
aid	16
it	16
may	16
be	16
we	16
shall	16
be	16
disenchanted;	16
for	16
great	16
deeds	16
are	16
reserved	16
for	16
great	16
men.’	16
“‘And	16
if	16
that	16
may	16
not	16
be,’	16
said	16
the	16
wretched	16
Durandarte	16
in	16
a	16
low	16
and	16
feeble	16
voice,	16
‘if	16
that	16
may	16
not	16
be,	16
then,	16
my	16
cousin,	16
I	16
say	16
“patience	16
and	16
shuffle;”’	16
and	16
turning	16
over	16
on	16
his	16
side,	16
he	16
relapsed	16
into	16
his	16
former	16
silence	16
without	16
uttering	16
another	16
word.	16

“And	16
now	16
there	16
was	16
heard	16
a	16
great	16
outcry	16
and	16
lamentation,	16
accompanied	16
by	16
deep	16
sighs	16
and	16
bitter	16
sobs.	16
I	16
looked	16
round,	16
and	16
through	16
the	16
crystal	16
wall	16
I	16
saw	16
passing	16
through	16
another	16
chamber	16
a	16
procession	16
of	16
two	16
lines	16
of	16
fair	16
damsels	16
all	16
clad	16
in	16
mourning,	16
and	16
with	16
white	16
turbans	16
of	16
Turkish	16
fashion	16
on	16
their	16
heads.	16
Behind,	16
in	16
the	16
rear	16
of	16
these,	16
there	16
came	16
a	16
lady,	16
for	16
so	16
from	16
her	16
dignity	16
she	16
seemed	16
to	16
be,	16
also	16
clad	16
in	16
black,	16
with	16
a	16
white	16
veil	16
so	16
long	16
and	16
ample	16
that	16
it	16
swept	16
the	16
ground.	16
Her	16
turban	16
was	16
twice	16
as	16
large	16
as	16
the	16
largest	16
of	16
any	16
of	16
the	16
others;	16
her	16
eyebrows	16
met,	16
her	16
nose	16
was	16
rather	16
flat,	16
her	16
mouth	16
was	16
large	16
but	16
with	16
ruddy	16
lips,	16
and	16
her	16
teeth,	16
of	16
which	16
at	16
times	16
she	16
allowed	16
a	16
glimpse,	16
were	16
seen	16
to	16
be	16
sparse	16
and	16
ill-set,	16
though	16
as	16
white	16
as	16
peeled	16
almonds.	16
She	16
carried	16
in	16
her	16
hands	16
a	16
fine	16
cloth,	16
and	16
in	16
it,	16
as	16
well	16
as	16
I	16
could	16
make	16
out,	16
a	16
heart	16
that	16
had	16
been	16
mummied,	16
so	16
parched	16
and	16
dried	16
was	16
it.	16
Montesinos	16
told	16
me	16
that	16
all	16
those	16
forming	16
the	16
procession	16
were	16
the	16
attendants	16
of	16
Durandarte	16
and	16
Belerma,	16
who	16
were	16
enchanted	16
there	16
with	16
their	16
master	16
and	16
mistress,	16
and	16
that	16
the	16
last,	16
she	16
who	16
carried	16
the	16
heart	16
in	16
the	16
cloth,	16
was	16
the	16
lady	16
Belerma,	16
who,	16
with	16
her	16
damsels,	16
four	16
days	16
in	16
the	16
week	16
went	16
in	16
procession	16
singing,	16
or	16
rather	16
weeping,	16
dirges	16
over	16
the	16
body	16
and	16
miserable	16
heart	16
of	16
his	16
cousin;	16
and	16
that	16
if	16
she	16
appeared	16
to	16
me	16
somewhat	16
ill-favoured	16
or	16
not	16
so	16
beautiful	16
as	16
fame	16
reported	16
her,	16
it	16
was	16
because	16
of	16
the	16
bad	16
nights	16
and	16
worse	16
days	16
that	16
she	16
passed	16
in	16
that	16
enchantment,	16
as	16
I	16
could	16
see	16
by	16
the	16
great	16
dark	16
circles	16
round	16
her	16
eyes,	16
and	16
her	16
sickly	16
complexion;	16
‘her	16
sallowness,	16
and	16
the	16
rings	16
round	16
her	16
eyes,’	16
said	16
he,	16
‘are	16
not	16
caused	16
by	16
the	16
periodical	16
ailment	16
usual	16
with	16
women,	16
for	16
it	16
is	16
many	16
months	16
and	16
even	16
years	16
since	16
she	16
has	16
had	16
any,	16
but	16
by	16
the	16
grief	16
her	16
own	16
heart	16
suffers	16
because	16
of	16
that	16
which	16
she	16
holds	16
in	16
her	16
hand	16
perpetually,	16
and	16
which	16
recalls	16
and	16
brings	16
back	16
to	16
her	16
memory	16
the	16
sad	16
fate	16
of	16
her	16
lost	16
lover;	16
were	16
it	16
not	16
for	16
this,	16
hardly	16
would	16
the	16
great	16
Dulcinea	16
del	16
Toboso,	16
so	16
celebrated	16
in	16
all	16
these	16
parts,	16
and	16
even	16
in	16
the	16
world,	16
come	16
up	16
to	16
her	16
for	16
beauty,	16
grace,	16
and	16
gaiety.’	16
“‘Hold	16
hard!’	16
said	16
I	16
at	16
this,	16
‘tell	16
your	16
story	16
as	16
you	16
ought,	16
Señor	16
Don	16
Montesinos,	16
for	16
you	16
know	16
very	16
well	16
that	16
all	16
comparisons	16
are	16
odious,	16
and	16
there	16
is	16
no	16
occasion	16
to	16
compare	16
one	16
person	16
with	16
another;	16
the	16
peerless	16
Dulcinea	16
del	16
Toboso	16
is	16
what	16
she	16
is,	16
and	16
the	16
lady	16
Doña	16
Belerma	16
is	16
what	16
_she_	16
is	16
and	16
has	16
been,	16
and	16
that’s	16
enough.’	16
To	16
which	16
he	16
made	16
answer,	16
‘Forgive	16
me,	16
Señor	16
Don	16
Quixote;	16
I	16
own	16
I	16
was	16
wrong	16
and	16
spoke	16
unadvisedly	16
in	16
saying	16
that	16
the	16
lady	16
Dulcinea	16
could	16
scarcely	16
come	16
up	16
to	16
the	16
lady	16
Belerma;	16
for	16
it	16
were	16
enough	16
for	16
me	16
to	16
have	16
learned,	16
by	16
what	16
means	16
I	16
know	16
not,	16
that	16
you	16
are	16
her	16
knight,	16
to	16
make	16
me	16
bite	16
my	16
tongue	16
out	16
before	16
I	16
compared	16
her	16
to	16
anything	16
save	16
heaven	16
itself.’	16
After	16
this	16
apology	16
which	16
the	16
great	16
Montesinos	16
made	16
me,	16
my	16
heart	16
recovered	16
itself	16
from	16
the	16
shock	16
I	16
had	16
received	16
in	16
hearing	16
my	16
lady	16
compared	16
with	16
Belerma.”	16
“Still	16
I	16
wonder,”	16
said	16
Sancho,	16
“that	16
your	16
worship	16
did	16
not	16
get	16
upon	16
the	16
old	16
fellow	16
and	16
bruise	16
every	16
bone	16
of	16
him	16
with	16
kicks,	16
and	16
pluck	16
his	16
beard	16
until	16
you	16
didn’t	16
leave	16
a	16
hair	16
in	16
it.”	16
“Nay,	16
Sancho,	16
my	16
friend,”	16
said	16
Don	16
Quixote,	16
“it	16
would	16
not	16
have	16
been	16
right	16
in	16
me	16
to	16
do	16
that,	16
for	16
we	16
are	16
all	16
bound	16
to	16
pay	16
respect	16
to	16
the	16
aged,	16
even	16
though	16
they	16
be	16
not	16
knights,	16
but	16
especially	16
to	16
those	16
who	16
are,	16
and	16
who	16
are	16
enchanted;	16
I	16
only	16
know	16
I	16
gave	16
him	16
as	16
good	16
as	16
he	16
brought	16
in	16
the	16
many	16
other	16
questions	16
and	16
answers	16
we	16
exchanged.”	16
“I	16
cannot	16
understand,	16
Señor	16
Don	16
Quixote,”	16
remarked	16
the	16
cousin	16
here,	16
“how	16
it	16
is	16
that	16
your	16
worship,	16
in	16
such	16
a	16
short	16
space	16
of	16
time	16
as	16
you	16
have	16
been	16
below	16
there,	16
could	16
have	16
seen	16
so	16
many	16
things,	16
and	16
said	16
and	16
answered	16
so	16
much.”	16
“How	16
long	16
is	16
it	16
since	16
I	16
went	16
down?”	16
asked	16
Don	16
Quixote.	16
“Little	16
better	16
than	16
an	16
hour,”	16
replied	16
Sancho.	16
“That	16
cannot	16
be,”	16
returned	16
Don	16
Quixote,	16
“because	16
night	16
overtook	16
me	16
while	16
I	16
was	16
there,	16
and	16
day	16
came,	16
and	16
it	16
was	16
night	16
again	16
and	16
day	16
again	16
three	16
times;	16
so	16
that,	16
by	16
my	16
reckoning,	16
I	16
have	16
been	16
three	16
days	16
in	16
those	16
remote	16
regions	16
beyond	16
our	16
ken.”	16
“My	16
master	16
must	16
be	16
right,”	16
replied	16
Sancho;	16
“for	16
as	16
everything	16
that	16
has	16
happened	16
to	16
him	16
is	16
by	16
enchantment,	16
maybe	16
what	16
seems	16
to	16
us	16
an	16
hour	16
would	16
seem	16
three	16
days	16
and	16
nights	16
there.”	16
“That’s	16
it,”	16
said	16
Don	16
Quixote.	16
“And	16
did	16
your	16
worship	16
eat	16
anything	16
all	16
that	16
time,	16
señor?”	16
asked	16
the	16
cousin.	16
“I	16
never	16
touched	16
a	16
morsel,”	16
answered	16
Don	16
Quixote,	16
“nor	16
did	16
I	16
feel	16
hunger,	16
or	16
think	16
of	16
it.”	16
“And	16
do	16
the	16
enchanted	16
eat?”	16
said	16
the	16
cousin.	16
“They	16
neither	16
eat,”	16
said	16
Don	16
Quixote;	16
“nor	16
are	16
they	16
subject	16
to	16
the	16
greater	16
excrements,	16
though	16
it	16
is	16
thought	16
that	16
their	16
nails,	16
beards,	16
and	16
hair	16
grow.”	16
“And	16
do	16
the	16
enchanted	16
sleep,	16
now,	16
señor?”	16
asked	16
Sancho.	16
“Certainly	16
not,”	16
replied	16
Don	16
Quixote;	16
“at	16
least,	16
during	16
those	16
three	16
days	16
I	16
was	16
with	16
them	16
not	16
one	16
of	16
them	16
closed	16
an	16
eye,	16
nor	16
did	16
I	16
either.”	16
“The	16
proverb,	16
‘Tell	16
me	16
what	16
company	16
thou	16
keepest	16
and	16
I’ll	16
tell	16
thee	16
what	16
thou	16
art,’	16
is	16
to	16
the	16
point	16
here,”	16
said	16
Sancho;	16
“your	16
worship	16
keeps	16
company	16
with	16
enchanted	16
people	16
that	16
are	16
always	16
fasting	16
and	16
watching;	16
what	16
wonder	16
is	16
it,	16
then,	16
that	16
you	16
neither	16
eat	16
nor	16
sleep	16
while	16
you	16
are	16
with	16
them?	16
But	16
forgive	16
me,	16
señor,	16
if	16
I	16
say	16
that	16
of	16
all	16
this	16
you	16
have	16
told	16
us	16
now,	16
may	16
God	16
take	16
me—I	16
was	16
just	16
going	16
to	16
say	16
the	16
devil—if	16
I	16
believe	16
a	16
single	16
particle.”	16
“What!”	16
said	16
the	16
cousin,	16
“has	16
Señor	16
Don	16
Quixote,	16
then,	16
been	16
lying?	16
Why,	16
even	16
if	16
he	16
wished	16
it	16
he	16
has	16
not	16
had	16
time	16
to	16
imagine	16
and	16
put	16
together	16
such	16
a	16
host	16
of	16
lies.”	16
“I	16
don’t	16
believe	16
my	16
master	16
lies,”	16
said	16
Sancho.	16
“If	16
not,	16
what	16
dost	16
thou	16
believe?”	16
asked	16
Don	16
Quixote.	16
“I	16
believe,”	16
replied	16
Sancho,	16
“that	16
this	16
Merlin,	16
or	16
those	16
enchanters	16
who	16
enchanted	16
the	16
whole	16
crew	16
your	16
worship	16
says	16
you	16
saw	16
and	16
discoursed	16
with	16
down	16
there,	16
stuffed	16
your	16
imagination	16
or	16
your	16
mind	16
with	16
all	16
this	16
rigmarole	16
you	16
have	16
been	16
treating	16
us	16
to,	16
and	16
all	16
that	16
is	16
still	16
to	16
come.”	16
“All	16
that	16
might	16
be,	16
Sancho,”	16
replied	16
Don	16
Quixote;	16
“but	16
it	16
is	16
not	16
so,	16
for	16
everything	16
that	16
I	16
have	16
told	16
you	16
I	16
saw	16
with	16
my	16
own	16
eyes,	16
and	16
touched	16
with	16
my	16
own	16
hands.	16
But	16
what	16
will	16
you	16
say	16
when	16
I	16
tell	16
you	16
now	16
how,	16
among	16
the	16
countless	16
other	16
marvellous	16
things	16
Montesinos	16
showed	16
me	16
(of	16
which	16
at	16
leisure	16
and	16
at	16
the	16
proper	16
time	16
I	16
will	16
give	16
thee	16
an	16
account	16
in	16
the	16
course	16
of	16
our	16
journey,	16
for	16
they	16
would	16
not	16
be	16
all	16
in	16
place	16
here),	16
he	16
showed	16
me	16
three	16
country	16
girls	16
who	16
went	16
skipping	16
and	16
capering	16
like	16
goats	16
over	16
the	16
pleasant	16
fields	16
there,	16
and	16
the	16
instant	16
I	16
beheld	16
them	16
I	16
knew	16
one	16
to	16
be	16
the	16
peerless	16
Dulcinea	16
del	16
Toboso,	16
and	16
the	16
other	16
two	16
those	16
same	16
country	16
girls	16
that	16
were	16
with	16
her	16
and	16
that	16
we	16
spoke	16
to	16
on	16
the	16
road	16
from	16
El	16
Toboso!	16
I	16
asked	16
Montesinos	16
if	16
he	16
knew	16
them,	16
and	16
he	16
told	16
me	16
he	16
did	16
not,	16
but	16
he	16
thought	16
they	16
must	16
be	16
some	16
enchanted	16
ladies	16
of	16
distinction,	16
for	16
it	16
was	16
only	16
a	16
few	16
days	16
before	16
that	16
they	16
had	16
made	16
their	16
appearance	16
in	16
those	16
meadows;	16
but	16
I	16
was	16
not	16
to	16
be	16
surprised	16
at	16
that,	16
because	16
there	16
were	16
a	16
great	16
many	16
other	16
ladies	16
there	16
of	16
times	16
past	16
and	16
present,	16
enchanted	16
in	16
various	16
strange	16
shapes,	16
and	16
among	16
them	16
he	16
had	16
recognised	16
Queen	16
Guinevere	16
and	16
her	16
dame	16
Quintañona,	16
she	16
who	16
poured	16
out	16
the	16
wine	16
for	16
Lancelot	16
when	16
he	16
came	16
from	16
Britain.”	16
When	16
Sancho	16
Panza	16
heard	16
his	16
master	16
say	16
this	16
he	16
was	16
ready	16
to	16
take	16
leave	16
of	16
his	16
senses,	16
or	16
die	16
with	16
laughter;	16
for,	16
as	16
he	16
knew	16
the	16
real	16
truth	16
about	16
the	16
pretended	16
enchantment	16
of	16
Dulcinea,	16
in	16
which	16
he	16
himself	16
had	16
been	16
the	16
enchanter	16
and	16
concocter	16
of	16
all	16
the	16
evidence,	16
he	16
made	16
up	16
his	16
mind	16
at	16
last	16
that,	16
beyond	16
all	16
doubt,	16
his	16
master	16
was	16
out	16
of	16
his	16
wits	16
and	16
stark	16
mad,	16
so	16
he	16
said	16
to	16
him,	16
“It	16
was	16
an	16
evil	16
hour,	16
a	16
worse	16
season,	16
and	16
a	16
sorrowful	16
day,	16
when	16
your	16
worship,	16
dear	16
master	16
mine,	16
went	16
down	16
to	16
the	16
other	16
world,	16
and	16
an	16
unlucky	16
moment	16
when	16
you	16
met	16
with	16
Señor	16
Montesinos,	16
who	16
has	16
sent	16
you	16
back	16
to	16
us	16
like	16
this.	16
You	16
were	16
well	16
enough	16
here	16
above	16
in	16
your	16
full	16
senses,	16
such	16
as	16
God	16
had	16
given	16
you,	16
delivering	16
maxims	16
and	16
giving	16
advice	16
at	16
every	16
turn,	16
and	16
not	16
as	16
you	16
are	16
now,	16
talking	16
the	16
greatest	16
nonsense	16
that	16
can	16
be	16
imagined.”	16
“As	16
I	16
know	16
thee,	16
Sancho,”	16
said	16
Don	16
Quixote,	16
“I	16
heed	16
not	16
thy	16
words.”	16
“Nor	16
I	16
your	16
worship’s,”	16
said	16
Sancho,	16
“whether	16
you	16
beat	16
me	16
or	16
kill	16
me	16
for	16
those	16
I	16
have	16
spoken,	16
and	16
will	16
speak	16
if	16
you	16
don’t	16
correct	16
and	16
mend	16
your	16
own.	16
But	16
tell	16
me,	16
while	16
we	16
are	16
still	16
at	16
peace,	16
how	16
or	16
by	16
what	16
did	16
you	16
recognise	16
the	16
lady	16
our	16
mistress;	16
and	16
if	16
you	16
spoke	16
to	16
her,	16
what	16
did	16
you	16
say,	16
and	16
what	16
did	16
she	16
answer?”	16
“I	16
recognised	16
her,”	16
said	16
Don	16
Quixote,	16
“by	16
her	16
wearing	16
the	16
same	16
garments	16
she	16
wore	16
when	16
thou	16
didst	16
point	16
her	16
out	16
to	16
me.	16
I	16
spoke	16
to	16
her,	16
but	16
she	16
did	16
not	16
utter	16
a	16
word	16
in	16
reply;	16
on	16
the	16
contrary,	16
she	16
turned	16
her	16
back	16
on	16
me	16
and	16
took	16
to	16
flight,	16
at	16
such	16
a	16
pace	16
that	16
crossbow	16
bolt	16
could	16
not	16
have	16
overtaken	16
her.	16
I	16
wished	16
to	16
follow	16
her,	16
and	16
would	16
have	16
done	16
so	16
had	16
not	16
Montesinos	16
recommended	16
me	16
not	16
to	16
take	16
the	16
trouble	16
as	16
it	16
would	16
be	16
useless,	16
particularly	16
as	16
the	16
time	16
was	16
drawing	16
near	16
when	16
it	16
would	16
be	16
necessary	16
for	16
me	16
to	16
quit	16
the	16
cavern.	16
He	16
told	16
me,	16
moreover,	16
that	16
in	16
course	16
of	16
time	16
he	16
would	16
let	16
me	16
know	16
how	16
he	16
and	16
Belerma,	16
and	16
Durandarte,	16
and	16
all	16
who	16
were	16
there,	16
were	16
to	16
be	16
disenchanted.	16
But	16
of	16
all	16
I	16
saw	16
and	16
observed	16
down	16
there,	16
what	16
gave	16
me	16
most	16
pain	16
was,	16
that	16
while	16
Montesinos	16
was	16
speaking	16
to	16
me,	16
one	16
of	16
the	16
two	16
companions	16
of	16
the	16
hapless	16
Dulcinea	16
approached	16
me	16
on	16
one	16
without	16
my	16
having	16
seen	16
her	16
coming,	16
and	16
with	16
tears	16
in	16
her	16
eyes	16
said	16
to	16
me,	16
in	16
a	16
low,	16
agitated	16
voice,	16
‘My	16
lady	16
Dulcinea	16
del	16
Toboso	16
kisses	16
your	16
worship’s	16
hands,	16
and	16
entreats	16
you	16
to	16
do	16
her	16
the	16
favour	16
of	16
letting	16
her	16
know	16
how	16
you	16
are;	16
and,	16
being	16
in	16
great	16
need,	16
she	16
also	16
entreats	16
your	16
worship	16
as	16
earnestly	16
as	16
she	16
can	16
to	16
be	16
so	16
good	16
as	16
to	16
lend	16
her	16
half	16
a	16
dozen	16
reals,	16
or	16
as	16
much	16
as	16
you	16
may	16
have	16
about	16
you,	16
on	16
this	16
new	16
dimity	16
petticoat	16
that	16
I	16
have	16
here;	16
and	16
she	16
promises	16
to	16
repay	16
them	16
very	16
speedily.’	16
I	16
was	16
amazed	16
and	16
taken	16
aback	16
by	16
such	16
a	16
message,	16
and	16
turning	16
to	16
Señor	16
Montesinos	16
I	16
asked	16
him,	16
‘Is	16
it	16
possible,	16
Señor	16
Montesinos,	16
that	16
persons	16
of	16
distinction	16
under	16
enchantment	16
can	16
be	16
in	16
need?’	16
To	16
which	16
he	16
replied,	16
‘Believe	16
me,	16
Señor	16
Don	16
Quixote,	16
that	16
which	16
is	16
called	16
need	16
is	16
to	16
be	16
met	16
with	16
everywhere,	16
and	16
penetrates	16
all	16
quarters	16
and	16
reaches	16
everyone,	16
and	16
does	16
not	16
spare	16
even	16
the	16
enchanted;	16
and	16
as	16
the	16
lady	16
Dulcinea	16
del	16
Toboso	16
sends	16
to	16
beg	16
those	16
six	16
reals,	16
and	16
the	16
pledge	16
is	16
to	16
all	16
appearance	16
a	16
good	16
one,	16
there	16
is	16
nothing	16
for	16
it	16
but	16
to	16
give	16
them	16
to	16
her,	16
for	16
no	16
doubt	16
she	16
must	16
be	16
in	16
some	16
great	16
strait.’	16
‘I	16
will	16
take	16
no	16
pledge	16
of	16
her,’	16
I	16
replied,	16
‘nor	16
yet	16
can	16
I	16
give	16
her	16
what	16
she	16
asks,	16
for	16
all	16
I	16
have	16
is	16
four	16
reals;	16
which	16
I	16
gave	16
(they	16
were	16
those	16
which	16
thou,	16
Sancho,	16
gavest	16
me	16
the	16
other	16
day	16
to	16
bestow	16
in	16
alms	16
upon	16
the	16
poor	16
I	16
met	16
along	16
the	16
road),	16
and	16
I	16
said,	16
‘Tell	16
your	16
mistress,	16
my	16
dear,	16
that	16
I	16
am	16
grieved	16
to	16
the	16
heart	16
because	16
of	16
her	16
distresses,	16
and	16
wish	16
I	16
was	16
a	16
Fucar	16
to	16
remedy	16
them,	16
and	16
that	16
I	16
would	16
have	16
her	16
know	16
that	16
I	16
cannot	16
be,	16
and	16
ought	16
not	16
be,	16
in	16
health	16
while	16
deprived	16
of	16
the	16
happiness	16
of	16
seeing	16
her	16
and	16
enjoying	16
her	16
discreet	16
conversation,	16
and	16
that	16
I	16
implore	16
her	16
as	16
earnestly	16
as	16
I	16
can,	16
to	16
allow	16
herself	16
to	16
be	16
seen	16
and	16
addressed	16
by	16
this	16
her	16
captive	16
servant	16
and	16
forlorn	16
knight.	16
Tell	16
her,	16
too,	16
that	16
when	16
she	16
least	16
expects	16
it	16
she	16
will	16
hear	16
it	16
announced	16
that	16
I	16
have	16
made	16
an	16
oath	16
and	16
vow	16
after	16
the	16
fashion	16
of	16
that	16
which	16
the	16
Marquis	16
of	16
Mantua	16
made	16
to	16
avenge	16
his	16
nephew	16
Baldwin,	16
when	16
he	16
found	16
him	16
at	16
the	16
point	16
of	16
death	16
in	16
the	16
heart	16
of	16
the	16
mountains,	16
which	16
was,	16
not	16
to	16
eat	16
bread	16
off	16
a	16
tablecloth,	16
and	16
other	16
trifling	16
matters	16
which	16
he	16
added,	16
until	16
he	16
had	16
avenged	16
him;	16
and	16
I	16
will	16
make	16
the	16
same	16
to	16
take	16
no	16
rest,	16
and	16
to	16
roam	16
the	16
seven	16
regions	16
of	16
the	16
earth	16
more	16
thoroughly	16
than	16
the	16
Infante	16
Don	16
Pedro	16
of	16
Portugal	16
ever	16
roamed	16
them,	16
until	16
I	16
have	16
disenchanted	16
her.’	16
‘All	16
that	16
and	16
more,	16
you	16
owe	16
my	16
lady,’	16
the	16
damsel’s	16
answer	16
to	16
me,	16
and	16
taking	16
the	16
four	16
reals,	16
instead	16
of	16
making	16
me	16
a	16
curtsey	16
she	16
cut	16
a	16
caper,	16
springing	16
two	16
full	16
yards	16
into	16
the	16
air.”	16
“O	16
blessed	16
God!”	16
exclaimed	16
Sancho	16
aloud	16
at	16
this,	16
“is	16
it	16
possible	16
that	16
such	16
things	16
can	16
be	16
in	16
the	16
world,	16
and	16
that	16
enchanters	16
and	16
enchantments	16
can	16
have	16
such	16
power	16
in	16
it	16
as	16
to	16
have	16
changed	16
my	16
master’s	16
right	16
senses	16
into	16
a	16
craze	16
so	16
full	16
of	16
absurdity!	16
O	16
señor,	17
for	17
God’s	17
sake,	17
consider	17
yourself,	17
have	17
a	17
care	17
for	17
your	17
honour,	17
and	17
give	17
no	17
credit	17
to	17
this	17
silly	17
stuff	17
that	17
has	17
left	17
you	17
scant	17
and	17
short	17
of	17
wits.”	17
“Thou	17
talkest	17
in	17
this	17
way	17
because	17
thou	17
lovest	17
me,	17
Sancho,”	17
said	17
Don	17
Quixote;	17
“and	17
not	17
being	17
experienced	17
in	17
the	17
things	17
of	17
the	17
world,	17
everything	17
that	17
has	17
some	17
difficulty	17
about	17
it	17
seems	17
to	17
thee	17
impossible;	17
but	17
time	17
will	17
pass,	17
as	17
I	17
said	17
before,	17
and	17
I	17
will	17
tell	17
thee	17
some	17
of	17
the	17
things	17
I	17
saw	17
down	17
there	17
which	17
will	17
make	17
thee	17
believe	17
what	17
I	17
have	17
related	17
now,	17
the	17
truth	17
of	17
which	17
admits	17
of	17
neither	17
reply	17
nor	17
question.”	17

He	17
who	17
translated	17
this	17
great	17
history	17
from	17
the	17
original	17
written	17
by	17
its	17
first	17
author,	17
Cide	17
Hamete	17
Benengeli,	17
says	17
that	17
on	17
coming	17
to	17
the	17
chapter	17
giving	17
the	17
adventures	17
of	17
the	17
cave	17
of	17
Montesinos	17
he	17
found	17
written	17
on	17
the	17
margin	17
of	17
it,	17
in	17
Hamete’s	17
own	17
hand,	17
these	17
exact	17
words:	17
“I	17
cannot	17
convince	17
or	17
persuade	17
myself	17
that	17
everything	17
that	17
is	17
written	17
in	17
the	17
preceding	17
chapter	17
could	17
have	17
precisely	17
happened	17
to	17
the	17
valiant	17
Don	17
Quixote;	17
and	17
for	17
this	17
reason,	17
that	17
all	17
the	17
adventures	17
that	17
have	17
occurred	17
up	17
to	17
the	17
present	17
have	17
been	17
possible	17
and	17
probable;	17
but	17
as	17
for	17
this	17
one	17
of	17
the	17
cave,	17
I	17
see	17
no	17
way	17
of	17
accepting	17
it	17
as	17
true,	17
as	17
it	17
passes	17
all	17
reasonable	17
bounds.	17
For	17
me	17
to	17
believe	17
that	17
Don	17
Quixote	17
could	17
lie,	17
he	17
being	17
the	17
most	17
truthful	17
gentleman	17
and	17
the	17
noblest	17
knight	17
of	17
his	17
time,	17
is	17
impossible;	17
he	17
would	17
not	17
have	17
told	17
a	17
lie	17
though	17
he	17
were	17
shot	17
to	17
death	17
with	17
arrows.	17
On	17
the	17
other	17
hand,	17
I	17
reflect	17
that	17
he	17
related	17
and	17
told	17
the	17
story	17
with	17
all	17
the	17
circumstances	17
detailed,	17
and	17
that	17
he	17
could	17
not	17
in	17
so	17
short	17
a	17
space	17
have	17
fabricated	17
such	17
a	17
vast	17
complication	17
of	17
absurdities;	17
if,	17
then,	17
this	17
adventure	17
seems	17
apocryphal,	17
it	17
is	17
no	17
fault	17
of	17
mine;	17
and	17
so,	17
without	17
affirming	17
its	17
falsehood	17
or	17
its	17
truth,	17
I	17
write	17
it	17
down.	17
Decide	17
for	17
thyself	17
in	17
thy	17
wisdom,	17
reader;	17
for	17
I	17
am	17
not	17
bound,	17
nor	17
is	17
it	17
in	17
my	17
power,	17
to	17
do	17
more;	17
though	17
certain	17
it	17
is	17
they	17
say	17
that	17
at	17
the	17
time	17
of	17
his	17
death	17
he	17
retracted,	17
and	17
said	17
he	17
had	17
invented	17
it,	17
thinking	17
it	17
matched	17
and	17
tallied	17
with	17
the	17
adventures	17
he	17
had	17
read	17
of	17
in	17
his	17
histories.”	17
And	17
then	17
he	17
goes	17
on	17
to	17
say:	17
The	17
cousin	17
was	17
amazed	17
as	17
well	17
at	17
Sancho’s	17
boldness	17
as	17
at	17
the	17
patience	17
of	17
his	17
master,	17
and	17
concluded	17
that	17
the	17
good	17
temper	17
the	17
latter	17
displayed	17
arose	17
from	17
the	17
happiness	17
he	17
felt	17
at	17
having	17
seen	17
his	17
lady	17
Dulcinea,	17
even	17
enchanted	17
as	17
she	17
was;	17
because	17
otherwise	17
the	17
words	17
and	17
language	17
Sancho	17
had	17
addressed	17
to	17
him	17
deserved	17
a	17
thrashing;	17
for	17
indeed	17
he	17
seemed	17
to	17
him	17
to	17
have	17
been	17
rather	17
impudent	17
to	17
his	17
master,	17
to	17
whom	17
he	17
now	17
observed,	17
“I,	17
Señor	17
Don	17
Quixote	17
of	17
La	17
Mancha,	17
look	17
upon	17
the	17
time	17
I	17
have	17
spent	17
in	17
travelling	17
with	17
your	17
worship	17
as	17
very	17
well	17
employed,	17
for	17
I	17
have	17
gained	17
four	17
things	17
in	17
the	17
course	17
of	17
it;	17
the	17
first	17
is	17
that	17
I	17
have	17
made	17
your	17
acquaintance,	17
which	17
I	17
consider	17
great	17
good	17
fortune;	17
the	17
second,	17
that	17
I	17
have	17
learned	17
what	17
the	17
cave	17
of	17
Montesinos	17
contains,	17
together	17
with	17
the	17
transformations	17
of	17
Guadiana	17
and	17
of	17
the	17
lakes	17
of	17
Ruidera;	17
which	17
will	17
be	17
of	17
use	17
to	17
me	17
for	17
the	17
Spanish	17
Ovid	17
that	17
I	17
have	17
in	17
hand;	17
the	17
third,	17
to	17
have	17
discovered	17
the	17
antiquity	17
of	17
cards,	17
that	17
they	17
were	17
in	17
use	17
at	17
least	17
in	17
the	17
time	17
of	17
Charlemagne,	17
as	17
may	17
be	17
inferred	17
from	17
the	17
words	17
you	17
say	17
Durandarte	17
uttered	17
when,	17
at	17
the	17
end	17
of	17
that	17
long	17
spell	17
while	17
Montesinos	17
was	17
talking	17
to	17
him,	17
he	17
woke	17
up	17
and	17
said,	17
‘Patience	17
and	17
shuffle.’	17
This	17
phrase	17
and	17
expression	17
he	17
could	17
not	17
have	17
learned	17
while	17
he	17
was	17
enchanted,	17
but	17
only	17
before	17
he	17
had	17
become	17
so,	17
in	17
France,	17
and	17
in	17
the	17
time	17
of	17
the	17
aforesaid	17
emperor	17
Charlemagne.	17
And	17
this	17
demonstration	17
is	17
just	17
the	17
thing	17
for	17
me	17
for	17
that	17
other	17
book	17
I	17
am	17
writing,	17
the	17
‘Supplement	17
to	17
Polydore	17
Vergil	17
on	17
the	17
Invention	17
of	17
Antiquities;’	17
for	17
I	17
believe	17
he	17
never	17
thought	17
of	17
inserting	17
that	17
of	17
cards	17
in	17
his	17
book,	17
as	17
I	17
mean	17
to	17
do	17
in	17
mine,	17
and	17
it	17
will	17
be	17
a	17
matter	17
of	17
great	17
importance,	17
particularly	17
when	17
I	17
can	17
cite	17
so	17
grave	17
and	17
veracious	17
an	17
authority	17
as	17
Señor	17
Durandarte.	17
And	17
the	17
fourth	17
thing	17
is,	17
that	17
I	17
have	17
ascertained	17
the	17
source	17
of	17
the	17
river	17
Guadiana,	17
heretofore	17
unknown	17
to	17
mankind.”	17
“You	17
are	17
right,”	17
said	17
Don	17
Quixote;	17
“but	17
I	17
should	17
like	17
to	17
know,	17
if	17
by	17
God’s	17
favour	17
they	17
grant	17
you	17
a	17
licence	17
to	17
print	17
those	17
books	17
of	17
yours—which	17
I	17
doubt—to	17
whom	17
do	17
you	17
mean	17
to	17
dedicate	17
them?”	17
“There	17
are	17
lords	17
and	17
grandees	17
in	17
Spain	17
to	17
whom	17
they	17
can	17
be	17
dedicated,”	17
said	17
the	17
cousin.	17
“Not	17
many,”	17
said	17
Don	17
Quixote;	17
“not	17
that	17
they	17
are	17
unworthy	17
of	17
it,	17
but	17
because	17
they	17
do	17
not	17
care	17
to	17
accept	17
books	17
and	17
incur	17
the	17
obligation	17
of	17
making	17
the	17
return	17
that	17
seems	17
due	17
to	17
the	17
author’s	17
labour	17
and	17
courtesy.	17
One	17
prince	17
I	17
know	17
who	17
makes	17
up	17
for	17
all	17
the	17
rest,	17
and	17
more—how	17
much	17
more,	17
if	17
I	17
ventured	17
to	17
say,	17
perhaps	17
I	17
should	17
stir	17
up	17
envy	17
in	17
many	17
a	17
noble	17
breast;	17
but	17
let	17
this	17
stand	17
over	17
for	17
some	17
more	17
convenient	17
time,	17
and	17
let	17
us	17
go	17
and	17
look	17
for	17
some	17
place	17
to	17
shelter	17
ourselves	17
in	17
to-night.”	17
“Not	17
far	17
from	17
this,”	17
said	17
the	17
cousin,	17
“there	17
is	17
a	17
hermitage,	17
where	17
there	17
lives	17
a	17
hermit,	17
who	17
they	17
say	17
was	17
a	17
soldier,	17
and	17
who	17
has	17
the	17
reputation	17
of	17
being	17
a	17
good	17
Christian	17
and	17
a	17
very	17
intelligent	17
and	17
charitable	17
man.	17
Close	17
to	17
the	17
hermitage	17
he	17
has	17
a	17
small	17
house	17
which	17
he	17
built	17
at	17
his	17
own	17
cost,	17
but	17
though	17
small	17
it	17
is	17
large	17
enough	17
for	17
the	17
reception	17
of	17
guests.”	17
“Has	17
this	17
hermit	17
any	17
hens,	17
do	17
you	17
think?”	17
asked	17
Sancho.	17
“Few	17
hermits	17
are	17
without	17
them,”	17
said	17
Don	17
Quixote;	17
“for	17
those	17
we	17
see	17
now-a-days	17
are	17
not	17
like	17
the	17
hermits	17
of	17
the	17
Egyptian	17
deserts	17
who	17
were	17
clad	17
in	17
palm-leaves,	17
and	17
lived	17
on	17
the	17
roots	17
of	17
the	17
earth.	17
But	17
do	17
not	17
think	17
that	17
by	17
praising	17
these	17
I	17
am	17
disparaging	17
the	17
others;	17
all	17
I	17
mean	17
to	17
say	17
is	17
that	17
the	17
penances	17
of	17
those	17
of	17
the	17
present	17
day	17
do	17
not	17
come	17
up	17
to	17
the	17
asceticism	17
and	17
austerity	17
of	17
former	17
times;	17
but	17
it	17
does	17
not	17
follow	17
from	17
this	17
that	17
they	17
are	17
not	17
all	17
worthy;	17
at	17
least	17
I	17
think	17
them	17
so;	17
and	17
at	17
the	17
worst	17
the	17
hypocrite	17
who	17
pretends	17
to	17
be	17
good	17
does	17
less	17
harm	17
than	17
the	17
open	17
sinner.”	17
At	17
this	17
point	17
they	17
saw	17
approaching	17
the	17
spot	17
where	17
they	17
stood	17
a	17
man	17
on	17
foot,	17
proceeding	17
at	17
a	17
rapid	17
pace,	17
and	17
beating	17
a	17
mule	17
loaded	17
with	17
lances	17
and	17
halberds.	17
When	17
he	17
came	17
up	17
to	17
them,	17
he	17
saluted	17
them	17
and	17
passed	17
on	17
without	17
stopping.	17
Don	17
Quixote	17
called	17
to	17
him,	17
“Stay,	17
good	17
fellow;	17
you	17
seem	17
to	17
be	17
making	17
more	17
haste	17
than	17
suits	17
that	17
mule.”	17
“I	17
cannot	17
stop,	17
señor,”	17
answered	17
the	17
man;	17
“for	17
the	17
arms	17
you	17
see	17
I	17
carry	17
here	17
are	17
to	17
be	17
used	17
to-morrow,	17
so	17
I	17
must	17
not	17
delay;	17
God	17
be	17
with	17
you.	17
But	17
if	17
you	17
want	17
to	17
know	17
what	17
I	17
am	17
carrying	17
them	17
for,	17
I	17
mean	17
to	17
lodge	17
to-night	17
at	17
the	17
inn	17
that	17
is	17
beyond	17
the	17
hermitage,	17
and	17
if	17
you	17
be	17
going	17
the	17
same	17
road	17
you	17
will	17
find	17
me	17
there,	17
and	17
I	17
will	17
tell	17
you	17
some	17
curious	17
things;	17
once	17
more	17
God	17
be	17
with	17
you;”	17
and	17
he	17
urged	17
on	17
his	17
mule	17
at	17
such	17
a	17
pace	17
that	17
Don	17
Quixote	17
had	17
no	17
time	17
to	17
ask	17
him	17
what	17
these	17
curious	17
things	17
were	17
that	17
he	17
meant	17
to	17
tell	17
them;	17
and	17
as	17
he	17
was	17
somewhat	17
inquisitive,	17
and	17
always	17
tortured	17
by	17
his	17
anxiety	17
to	17
learn	17
something	17
new,	17
he	17
decided	17
to	17
set	17
out	17
at	17
once,	17
and	17
go	17
and	17
pass	17
the	17
night	17
at	17
the	17
inn	17
instead	17
of	17
stopping	17
at	17
the	17
hermitage,	17
where	17
the	17
cousin	17
would	17
have	17
had	17
them	17
halt.	17
Accordingly	17
they	17
mounted	17
and	17
all	17
three	17
took	17
the	17
direct	17
road	17
for	17
the	17
inn,	17
which	17
they	17
reached	17
a	17
little	17
before	17
nightfall.	17
On	17
the	17
road	17
the	17
cousin	17
proposed	17
they	17
should	17
go	17
up	17
to	17
the	17
hermitage	17
to	17
drink	17
a	17
sup.	17
The	17
instant	17
Sancho	17
heard	17
this	17
he	17
steered	17
his	17
Dapple	17
towards	17
it,	17
and	17
Don	17
Quixote	17
and	17
the	17
cousin	17
did	17
the	17
same;	17
but	17
it	17
seems	17
Sancho’s	17
bad	17
luck	17
so	17
ordered	17
it	17
that	17
the	17
hermit	17
was	17
not	17
at	17
home,	17
for	17
so	17
a	17
sub-hermit	17
they	17
found	17
in	17
the	17
hermitage	17
told	17
them.	17
They	17
called	17
for	17
some	17
of	17
the	17
best.	17
She	17
replied	17
that	17
her	17
master	17
had	17
none,	17
but	17
that	17
if	17
they	17
liked	17
cheap	17
water	17
she	17
would	17
give	17
it	17
with	17
great	17
pleasure.	17
“If	17
I	17
found	17
any	17
in	17
water,”	17
said	17
Sancho,	17
“there	17
are	17
wells	17
along	17
the	17
road	17
where	17
I	17
could	17
have	17
had	17
enough	17
of	17
it.	17
Ah,	17
Camacho’s	17
wedding,	17
and	17
plentiful	17
house	17
of	17
Don	17
Diego,	17
how	17
often	17
do	17
I	17
miss	17
you!”	17
Leaving	17
the	17
hermitage,	17
they	17
pushed	17
on	17
towards	17
the	17
inn,	17
and	17
a	17
little	17
farther	17
they	17
came	17
upon	17
a	17
youth	17
who	17
was	17
pacing	17
along	17
in	17
front	17
of	17
them	17
at	17
no	17
great	17
speed,	17
so	17
that	17
they	17
overtook	17
him.	17
He	17
carried	17
a	17
sword	17
over	17
his	17
shoulder,	17
and	17
slung	17
on	17
it	17
a	17
budget	17
or	17
bundle	17
of	17
his	17
clothes	17
apparently,	17
probably	17
his	17
breeches	17
or	17
pantaloons,	17
and	17
his	17
cloak	17
and	17
a	17
shirt	17
or	17
two;	17
for	17
he	17
had	17
on	17
a	17
short	17
jacket	17
of	17
velvet	17
with	17
a	17
gloss	17
like	17
satin	17
on	17
it	17
in	17
places,	17
and	17
had	17
his	17
shirt	17
out;	17
his	17
stockings	17
were	17
of	17
silk,	17
and	17
his	17
shoes	17
square-toed	17
as	17
they	17
wear	17
them	17
at	17
court.	17
His	17
age	17
might	17
have	17
been	17
eighteen	17
or	17
nineteen;	17
he	17
was	17
of	17
a	17
merry	17
countenance,	17
and	17
to	17
all	17
appearance	17
of	17
an	17
active	17
habit,	17
and	17
he	17
went	17
along	17
singing	17
seguidillas	17
to	17
beguile	17
the	17
wearisomeness	17
of	17
the	17
road.	17
As	17
they	17
came	17
up	17
with	17
him	17
he	17
was	17
just	17
finishing	17
one,	17
which	17
the	17
cousin	17
got	17
by	17
heart	17
and	17
they	17
say	17
ran	17
thus—	17
I’m	17
off	17
to	17
the	17
wars	17
For	17
the	17
want	17
of	17
pence,	17
Oh,	17
had	17
I	17
but	17
money	17
I’d	17
show	17
more	17
sense.	17
The	17
first	17
to	17
address	17
him	17
was	17
Don	17
Quixote,	17
who	17
said,	17
“You	17
travel	17
very	17
airily,	17
sir	17
gallant;	17
whither	17
bound,	17
may	17
we	17
ask,	17
if	17
it	17
is	17
your	17
pleasure	17
to	17
tell	17
us?”	17
To	17
which	17
the	17
youth	17
replied,	17
“The	17
heat	17
and	17
my	17
poverty	17
are	17
the	17
reason	17
of	17
my	17
travelling	17
so	17
airily,	17
and	17
it	17
is	17
to	17
the	17
wars	17
that	17
I	17
am	17
bound.”	17
“How	17
poverty?”	17
asked	17
Don	17
Quixote;	17
“the	17
heat	17
one	17
can	17
understand.”	17
“Señor,”	17
replied	17
the	17
youth,	17
“in	17
this	17
bundle	17
I	17
carry	17
velvet	17
pantaloons	17
to	17
match	17
this	17
jacket;	17
if	17
I	17
wear	17
them	17
out	17
on	17
the	17
road,	17
I	17
shall	17
not	17
be	17
able	17
to	17
make	17
a	17
decent	17
appearance	17
in	17
them	17
in	17
the	17
city,	17
and	17
I	17
have	17
not	17
the	17
wherewithal	17
to	17
buy	17
others;	17
and	17
so	17
for	17
this	17
reason,	17
as	17
well	17
as	17
to	17
keep	17
myself	17
cool,	17
I	17
am	17
making	17
my	17
way	17
in	17
this	17
fashion	17
to	17
overtake	17
some	17
companies	17
of	17
infantry	17
that	17
are	17
not	17
twelve	17
leagues	17
off,	17
in	17
which	17
I	17
shall	17
enlist,	17
and	17
there	17
will	17
be	17
no	17
want	17
of	17
baggage	17
trains	17
to	17
travel	17
with	17
after	17
that	17
to	17
the	17
place	17
of	17
embarkation,	17
which	17
they	17
say	17
will	17
be	17
Carthagena;	17
I	17
would	17
rather	17
have	17
the	17
King	17
for	17
a	17
master,	17
and	17
serve	17
him	17
in	17
the	17
wars,	17
than	17
serve	17
a	17
court	17
pauper.”	17
“And	17
did	17
you	17
get	17
any	17
bounty,	17
now?”	17
asked	17
the	17
cousin.	17
“If	17
I	17
had	17
been	17
in	17
the	17
service	17
of	17
some	17
grandee	17
of	17
Spain	17
or	17
personage	17
of	17
distinction,”	17
replied	17
the	17
youth,	17
“I	17
should	17
have	17
been	17
safe	17
to	17
get	17
it;	17
for	17
that	17
is	17
the	17
advantage	17
of	17
serving	17
good	17
masters,	17
that	17
out	17
of	17
the	17
servants’	17
hall	17
men	17
come	17
to	17
be	17
ancients	17
or	17
captains,	17
or	17
get	17
a	17
good	17
pension.	17
But	17
I,	17
to	17
my	17
misfortune,	17
always	17
served	17
place-hunters	17
and	17
adventurers,	17
whose	17
keep	17
and	17
wages	17
were	17
so	17
miserable	17
and	17
scanty	17
that	17
half	17
went	17
in	17
paying	17
for	17
the	17
starching	17
of	17
one’s	17
collars;	17
it	17
would	17
be	17
a	17
miracle	17
indeed	17
if	17
a	17
page	17
volunteer	17
ever	17
got	17
anything	17
like	17
a	17
reasonable	17
bounty.”	17
“And	17
tell	17
me,	17
for	17
heaven’s	17
sake,”	17
asked	17
Don	17
Quixote,	17
“is	17
it	17
possible,	17
my	17
friend,	17
that	17
all	17
the	17
time	17
you	17
served	17
you	17
never	17
got	17
any	17
livery?”	17
“They	17
gave	17
me	17
two,”	17
replied	17
the	17
page;	17
“but	17
just	17
as	17
when	17
one	17
quits	17
a	17
religious	17
community	17
before	17
making	17
profession,	17
they	17
strip	17
him	17
of	17
the	17
dress	17
of	17
the	17
order	17
and	17
give	17
him	17
back	17
his	17
own	17
clothes,	17
so	17
did	17
my	17
masters	17
return	17
me	17
mine;	17
for	17
as	17
soon	17
as	17
the	17
business	17
on	17
which	17
they	17
came	17
to	17
court	17
was	17
finished,	17
they	17
went	17
home	17
and	17
took	17
back	17
the	17
liveries	17
they	17
had	17
given	17
merely	17
for	17
show.”	17
“What	17
spilorceria!—as	17
an	17
Italian	17
would	17
say,”	17
said	17
Don	17
Quixote;	17
“but	17
for	17
all	17
that,	17
consider	17
yourself	17
happy	17
in	17
having	17
left	17
court	17
with	17
as	17
worthy	17
an	17
object	17
as	17
you	17
have,	17
for	17
there	17
is	17
nothing	17
on	17
earth	17
more	17
honourable	17
or	17
profitable	17
than	17
serving,	17
first	17
of	17
all	17
God,	17
and	17
then	17
one’s	17
king	17
and	17
natural	17
lord,	17
particularly	17
in	17
the	17
profession	17
of	17
arms,	17
by	17
which,	17
if	17
not	17
more	17
wealth,	17
at	17
least	17
more	17
honour	17
is	17
to	17
be	17
won	17
than	17
by	17
letters,	17
as	17
I	17
have	17
said	17
many	17
a	17
time;	17
for	17
though	17
letters	17
may	17
have	17
founded	17
more	17
great	17
houses	17
than	17
arms,	17
still	17
those	17
founded	17
by	17
arms	17
have	17
I	17
know	17
not	17
what	17
superiority	17
over	17
those	17
founded	17
by	17
letters,	17
and	17
a	17
certain	17
splendour	17
belonging	17
to	17
them	17
that	17
distinguishes	17
them	17
above	17
all.	17
And	17
bear	17
in	17
mind	17
what	17
I	17
am	17
now	17
about	17
to	17
say	17
to	17
you,	17
for	17
it	17
will	17
be	17
of	17
great	17
use	17
and	17
comfort	17
to	17
you	17
in	17
time	17
of	17
trouble;	17
it	17
is,	17
not	17
to	17
let	17
your	17
mind	17
dwell	17
on	17
the	17
adverse	17
chances	17
that	17
may	17
befall	17
you;	17
for	17
the	17
worst	17
of	17
all	17
is	17
death,	17
and	17
if	17
it	17
be	17
a	17
good	17
death,	17
the	17
best	17
of	17
all	17
is	17
to	17
die.	17
They	17
asked	17
Julius	17
Cæsar,	17
the	17
valiant	17
Roman	17
emperor,	17
what	17
was	17
the	17
best	17
death.	17
He	17
answered,	17
that	17
which	17
is	17
unexpected,	17
which	17
comes	17
suddenly	17
and	17
unforeseen;	17
and	17
though	17
he	17
answered	17
like	17
a	17
pagan,	17
and	17
one	17
without	17
the	17
knowledge	17
of	17
the	17
true	17
God,	17
yet,	17
as	17
far	17
as	17
sparing	17
our	17
feelings	17
is	17
concerned,	17
he	17
was	17
right;	17
for	17
suppose	17
you	17
are	17
killed	17
in	17
the	17
first	17
engagement	17
or	17
skirmish,	17
whether	17
by	17
a	17
cannon	17
ball	17
or	17
blown	17
up	17
by	17
mine,	17
what	17
matters	17
it?	17
It	17
is	17
only	17
dying,	17
and	17
all	17
is	17
over;	17
and	17
according	17
to	17
Terence,	17
a	17
soldier	17
shows	17
better	17
dead	17
in	17
battle,	17
than	17
alive	17
and	17
safe	17
in	17
flight;	17
and	17
the	17
good	17
soldier	17
wins	17
fame	17
in	17
proportion	17
as	17
he	17
is	17
obedient	17
to	17
his	17
captains	17
and	17
those	17
in	17
command	17
over	17
him.	17
And	17
remember,	17
my	17
son,	17
that	17
it	17
is	17
better	17
for	17
the	17
soldier	17
to	17
smell	17
of	17
gunpowder	17
than	17
of	17
civet,	17
and	17
that	17
if	17
old	17
age	17
should	17
come	17
upon	17
you	17
in	17
this	17
honourable	17
calling,	17
though	17
you	17
may	17
be	17
covered	17
with	17
wounds	17
and	17
crippled	17
and	17
lame,	17
it	17
will	17
not	17
come	17
upon	17
you	17
without	17
honour,	17
and	17
that	17
such	17
as	17
poverty	17
cannot	17
lessen;	17
especially	17
now	17
that	17
provisions	17
are	17
being	17
made	17
for	17
supporting	17
and	17
relieving	17
old	17
and	17
disabled	17
soldiers;	17
for	17
it	17
is	17
not	17
right	17
to	17
deal	17
with	17
them	17
after	17
the	17
fashion	17
of	17
those	17
who	17
set	17
free	17
and	17
get	17
rid	17
of	17
their	17
black	17
slaves	17
when	17
they	17
are	17
old	17
and	17
useless,	17
and,	17
turning	17
them	17
out	17
of	17
their	17
houses	17
under	17
the	17
pretence	17
of	17
making	17
them	17
free,	17
make	17
them	17
slaves	17
to	17
hunger,	17
from	17
which	17
they	17
cannot	17
expect	17
to	17
be	17
released	17
except	17
by	17
death.	17
But	17
for	17
the	17
present	17
I	17
won’t	17
say	17
more	17
than	17
get	17
ye	17
up	17
behind	17
me	17
on	17
my	17
horse	17
as	17
far	17
as	17
the	17
inn,	17
and	17
sup	17
with	17
me	17
there,	17
and	17
to-morrow	17
you	17
shall	17
pursue	17
your	17
journey,	17
and	17
God	17
give	17
you	17
as	17
good	17
speed	17
as	17
your	17
intentions	17
deserve.”	17
The	17
page	17
did	17
not	17
accept	17
the	17
invitation	17
to	17
mount,	17
though	17
he	17
did	17
that	17
to	17
supper	17
at	17
the	17
inn;	17
and	17
here	17
they	17
say	17
Sancho	17
said	17
to	17
himself,	17
“God	17
be	17
with	17
you	17
for	17
a	17
master;	17
is	17
it	17
possible	17
that	17
a	17
man	17
who	17
can	17
say	17
things	17
so	17
many	17
and	17
so	17
good	17
as	17
he	17
has	17
said	17
just	17
now,	17
can	17
say	17
that	17
he	17
saw	17
the	17
impossible	17
absurdities	17
he	17
reports	17
about	17
the	17
cave	17
of	17
Montesinos?	17
Well,	17
well,	17
we	17
shall	17
see.”	17
And	17
now,	17
just	17
as	17
night	17
was	17
falling,	17
they	17
reached	17
the	17
inn,	17
and	17
it	17
was	17
not	17
without	17
satisfaction	17
that	17
Sancho	17
perceived	17
his	17
master	17
took	17
it	17
for	17
a	17
real	17
inn,	17
and	17
not	17
for	17
a	17
castle	17
as	17
usual.	17
The	17
instant	17
they	17
entered	17
Don	17
Quixote	17
asked	17
the	17
landlord	17
after	17
the	17
man	17
with	17
the	17
lances	17
and	17
halberds,	17
and	17
was	17
told	17
that	17
he	17
was	17
in	17
the	17
stable	17
seeing	17
to	17
his	17
mule;	17
which	17
was	17
what	17
Sancho	17
and	17
the	17
cousin	17
proceeded	17
to	17
do	17
for	17
their	17
beasts,	17
giving	17
the	17
best	17
manger	17
and	17
the	17
best	17
place	17
in	17
the	17
stable	17
to	17
Rocinante.	17

Don	17
Quixote’s	17
bread	17
would	17
not	17
bake,	17
as	17
the	17
common	17
saying	17
is,	17
until	17
he	17
had	17
heard	17
and	17
learned	17
the	17
curious	17
things	17
promised	17
by	17
the	17
man	17
who	17
carried	17
the	17
arms.	17
He	17
went	17
to	17
seek	17
him	17
where	17
the	17
innkeeper	17
said	17
he	17
was	17
and	17
having	17
found	17
him,	17
bade	17
him	17
say	17
now	17
at	17
any	17
rate	17
what	17
he	17
had	17
to	17
say	17
in	17
answer	17
to	17
the	17
question	17
he	17
had	17
asked	17
him	17
on	17
the	17
road.	17
“The	17
tale	17
of	17
my	17
wonders	17
must	17
be	17
taken	17
more	17
leisurely	17
and	17
not	17
standing,”	17
said	17
the	17
man;	17
“let	17
me	17
finish	17
foddering	17
my	17
beast,	17
good	17
sir;	17
and	17
then	17
I’ll	17
tell	17
you	17
things	17
that	17
will	17
astonish	17
you.”	17
“Don’t	17
wait	17
for	17
that,”	17
said	17
Don	17
Quixote;	17
“I’ll	17
help	17
you	17
in	17
everything,”	17
and	17
so	17
he	17
did,	17
sifting	17
the	17
barley	17
for	17
him	17
and	17
cleaning	17
out	17
the	17
manger;	17
a	17
degree	17
of	17
humility	17
which	17
made	17
the	17
other	17
feel	17
bound	17
to	17
tell	17
him	17
with	17
a	17
good	17
grace	17
what	17
he	17
had	17
asked;	17
so	17
seating	17
himself	17
on	17
a	17
bench,	17
with	17
Don	17
Quixote	17
beside	17
him,	17
and	17
the	17
cousin,	17
the	17
page,	17
Sancho	17
Panza,	17
and	17
the	17
landlord,	17
for	17
a	17
senate	17
and	17
an	17
audience,	17
he	17
began	17
his	17
story	17
in	17
this	17
way:	17
“You	17
must	17
know	17
that	17
in	17
a	17
village	17
four	17
leagues	17
and	17
a	17
half	17
from	17
this	17
inn,	17
it	17
so	17
happened	17
that	17
one	17
of	17
the	17
regidors,	17
by	17
the	17
tricks	17
and	17
roguery	17
of	17
a	17
servant	17
girl	17
of	17
his	17
(it’s	17
too	17
long	17
a	17
tale	17
to	17
tell),	17
lost	17
an	17
ass;	17
and	17
though	17
he	17
did	17
all	17
he	17
possibly	17
could	17
to	17
find	17
it,	17
it	17
was	17
all	17
to	17
no	17
purpose.	17
A	17
fortnight	17
might	17
have	17
gone	17
by,	17
so	17
the	17
story	17
goes,	17
since	17
the	17
ass	17
had	17
been	17
missing,	17
when,	17
as	17
the	17
regidor	17
who	17
had	17
lost	17
it	17
was	17
standing	17
in	17
the	17
plaza,	17
another	17
regidor	17
of	17
the	17
same	17
town	17
said	17
to	17
him,	17
‘Pay	17
me	17
for	17
good	17
news,	17
gossip;	17
your	17
ass	17
has	17
turned	17
up.’	17
‘That	17
I	17
will,	17
and	17
well,	17
gossip,’	17
said	17
the	17
other;	17
‘but	17
tell	17
us,	17
where	17
has	17
he	17
turned	17
up?’	17
‘In	17
the	17
forest,’	17
said	17
the	17
finder;	17
‘I	17
saw	17
him	17
this	17
morning	17
without	17
pack-saddle	17
or	17
harness	17
of	17
any	17
sort,	17
and	17
so	17
lean	17
that	17
it	17
went	17
to	17
one’s	17
heart	17
to	17
see	17
him.	17
I	17
tried	17
to	17
drive	17
him	17
before	17
me	17
and	17
bring	17
him	17
to	17
you,	17
but	17
he	17
is	17
already	17
so	17
wild	17
and	17
shy	17
that	17
when	17
I	17
went	17
near	17
him	17
he	17
made	17
off	17
into	17
the	17
thickest	17
part	17
of	17
the	17
forest.	17
If	17
you	17
have	17
a	17
mind	17
that	17
we	17
two	17
should	17
go	17
back	17
and	17
look	17
for	17
him,	17
let	17
me	17
put	17
up	17
this	17
she-ass	17
at	17
my	17
house	17
and	17
I’ll	17
be	17
back	17
at	17
once.’	17
‘You	17
will	17
be	17
doing	17
me	17
a	17
great	17
kindness,’	17
said	17
the	17
owner	17
of	17
the	17
ass,	17
‘and	17
I’ll	17
try	17
to	17
pay	17
it	17
back	17
in	17
the	17
same	17
coin.’	17
It	17
is	17
with	17
all	17
these	17
circumstances,	17
and	17
in	17
the	17
very	17
same	17
way	17
I	17
am	17
telling	17
it	17
now,	17
that	17
those	17
who	17
know	17
all	17
about	17
the	17
matter	17
tell	17
the	17
story.	17
Well	17
then,	17
the	17
two	17
regidors	17
set	17
off	17
on	17
foot,	17
arm	17
in	17
arm,	17
for	17
the	17
forest,	17
and	17
coming	17
to	17
the	17
place	17
where	17
they	17
hoped	17
to	17
find	17
the	17
ass	17
they	17
could	17
not	17
find	17
him,	17
nor	17
was	17
he	17
to	17
be	17
seen	17
anywhere	17
about,	17
search	17
as	17
they	17
might.	17
Seeing,	17
then,	17
that	17
there	17
was	17
no	17
sign	17
of	17
him,	17
the	17
regidor	17
who	17
had	17
seen	17
him	17
said	17
to	17
the	17
other,	17
‘Look	17
here,	17
gossip;	17
a	17
plan	17
has	17
occurred	17
to	17
me,	17
by	17
which,	17
beyond	17
a	17
doubt,	17
we	17
shall	17
manage	17
to	17
discover	17
the	17
animal,	17
even	17
if	17
he	17
is	17
stowed	17
away	17
in	17
the	17
bowels	17
of	17
the	17
earth,	17
not	17
to	17
say	17
the	17
forest.	17
Here	17
it	17
is.	17
I	17
can	17
bray	17
to	17
perfection,	17
and	17
if	17
you	17
can	17
ever	17
so	17
little,	17
the	17
thing’s	17
as	17
good	17
as	17
done.’	17
‘Ever	17
so	17
little	17
did	17
you	17
say,	17
gossip?’	17
said	17
the	17
other;	17
‘by	17
God,	17
I’ll	17
not	17
give	17
in	17
to	17
anybody,	17
not	17
even	17
to	17
the	17
asses	17
themselves.’	17
‘We’ll	17
soon	17
see,’	17
said	17
the	17
second	17
regidor,	17
‘for	17
my	17
plan	17
is	17
that	17
you	17
should	17
go	17
one	17
side	17
of	17
the	17
forest,	17
and	17
I	17
the	17
other,	17
so	17
as	17
to	17
go	17
all	17
round	17
about	17
it;	17
and	17
every	17
now	17
and	17
then	17
you	17
will	17
bray	17
and	17
I	17
will	17
bray;	17
and	17
it	17
cannot	17
be	17
but	17
that	17
the	17
ass	17
will	17
hear	17
us,	17
and	17
answer	17
us	17
if	17
he	17
is	17
in	17
the	17
forest.’	17
To	17
which	17
the	17
owner	17
of	17
the	17
ass	17
replied,	17
‘It’s	17
an	17
excellent	17
plan,	17
I	17
declare,	17
gossip,	17
and	17
worthy	17
of	17
your	17
great	17
genius;’	17
and	17
the	17
two	17
separating	17
as	17
agreed,	17
it	17
so	17
fell	17
out	17
that	17
they	17
brayed	17
almost	17
at	17
the	17
same	17
moment,	17
and	17
each,	17
deceived	17
by	17
the	17
braying	17
of	17
the	17
other,	17
ran	17
to	17
look,	17
fancying	17
the	17
ass	17
had	17
turned	17
up	17
at	17
last.	17
When	17
they	17
came	17
in	17
sight	17
of	17
one	17
another,	17
said	17
the	17
loser,	17
‘Is	17
it	17
possible,	17
gossip,	17
that	17
it	17
was	17
not	17
my	17
ass	17
that	17
brayed?’	17
‘No,	17
it	17
was	17
I,’	17
said	17
the	17
other.	17
‘Well	17
then,	17
I	17
can	17
tell	17
you,	17
gossip,’	17
said	17
the	17
ass’s	17
owner,	17
‘that	17
between	17
you	17
and	17
an	17
ass	17
there	17
is	17
not	17
an	17
atom	17
of	17
difference	17
as	17
far	17
as	17
braying	17
goes,	17
for	17
I	17
never	17
in	17
all	17
my	17
life	17
saw	17
or	17
heard	17
anything	17
more	17
natural.’	17
‘Those	17
praises	17
and	17
compliments	17
belong	17
to	17
you	17
more	17
justly	17
than	17
to	17
me,	17
gossip,’	17
said	17
the	17
inventor	17
of	17
the	17
plan;	17
‘for,	17
by	17
the	17
God	17
that	17
made	17
me,	17
you	17
might	17
give	17
a	17
couple	17
of	17
brays	17
odds	17
to	17
the	17
best	17
and	17
most	17
finished	17
brayer	17
in	17
the	17
world;	17
the	17
tone	17
you	17
have	17
got	17
is	17
deep,	17
your	17
voice	17
is	17
well	17
kept	17
up	17
as	17
to	17
time	17
and	17
pitch,	17
and	17
your	17
finishing	17
notes	17
come	17
thick	17
and	17
fast;	17
in	17
fact,	17
I	17
own	17
myself	17
beaten,	17
and	17
yield	17
the	17
palm	17
to	17
you,	17
and	17
give	17
in	17
to	17
you	17
in	17
this	17
rare	17
accomplishment.’	17
‘Well	17
then,’	17
said	17
the	17
owner,	17
‘I’ll	17
set	17
a	17
higher	17
value	17
on	17
myself	17
for	17
the	17
future,	17
and	17
consider	17
that	17
I	17
know	17
something,	17
as	17
I	17
have	17
an	17
excellence	17
of	17
some	17
sort;	17
for	17
though	17
I	17
always	17
thought	17
I	17
brayed	17
well,	17
I	17
never	17
supposed	17
I	17
came	17
up	17
to	17
the	17
pitch	17
of	17
perfection	17
you	17
say.’	17
‘And	17
I	17
say	17
too,’	17
said	17
the	17
second,	17
‘that	17
there	17
are	17
rare	17
gifts	17
going	17
to	17
loss	17
in	17
the	17
world,	17
and	17
that	17
they	17
are	17
ill	17
bestowed	17
upon	17
those	17
who	17
don’t	17
know	17
how	17
to	17
make	17
use	17
of	17
them.’	17
‘Ours,’	17
said	17
the	17
owner	17
of	17
the	17
ass,	17
‘unless	17
it	17
is	17
in	17
cases	17
like	17
this	17
we	17
have	17
now	17
in	17
hand,	17
cannot	17
be	17
of	17
any	17
service	17
to	17
us,	17
and	17
even	17
in	17
this	17
God	17
grant	17
they	17
may	17
be	17
of	17
some	17
use.’	17
So	17
saying	17
they	17
separated,	17
and	17
took	17
to	17
their	17
braying	17
once	17
more,	17
but	17
every	17
instant	17
they	17
were	17
deceiving	17
one	17
another,	17
and	17
coming	17
to	17
meet	17
one	17
another	17
again,	17
until	17
they	17
arranged	17
by	17
way	17
of	17
countersign,	17
so	17
as	17
to	17
know	17
that	17
it	17
was	17
they	17
and	17
not	17
the	17
ass,	17
to	17
give	17
two	17
brays,	17
one	17
after	17
the	17
other.	17
In	17
this	17
way,	17
doubling	17
the	17
brays	17
at	17
every	17
step,	17
they	17
made	17
the	17
complete	17
circuit	17
of	17
the	17
forest,	17
but	17
the	17
lost	17
ass	17
never	17
gave	17
them	17
an	17
answer	17
or	17
even	17
the	17
sign	17
of	17
one.	17
How	17
could	17
the	17
poor	17
ill-starred	17
brute	17
have	17
answered,	17
when,	17
in	17
the	17
thickest	17
part	17
of	17
the	17
forest,	17
they	17
found	17
him	17
devoured	17
by	17
wolves?	17
As	17
soon	17
as	17
he	17
saw	17
him	17
his	17
owner	17
said,	17
‘I	17
was	17
wondering	17
he	17
did	17
not	17
answer,	17
for	17
if	17
he	17
wasn’t	17
dead	17
he’d	17
have	17
brayed	17
when	17
he	17
heard	17
us,	17
or	17
he’d	17
have	17
been	17
no	17
ass;	17
but	17
for	17
the	17
sake	17
of	17
having	17
heard	17
you	17
bray	17
to	17
such	17
perfection,	17
gossip,	17
I	17
count	17
the	17
trouble	17
I	17
have	17
taken	17
to	17
look	17
for	17
him	17
well	17
bestowed,	17
even	17
though	17
I	17
have	17
found	17
him	17
dead.’	17
‘It’s	17
in	17
a	17
good	17
hand,	17
gossip,’	17
said	17
the	17
other;	17
‘if	17
the	17
abbot	17
sings	17
well,	17
the	17
acolyte	17
is	17
not	17
much	17
behind	17
him.’	17
So	17
they	17
returned	17
disconsolate	17
and	17
hoarse	17
to	17
their	17
village,	17
where	17
they	17
told	17
their	17
friends,	17
neighbours,	17
and	17
acquaintances	17
what	17
had	17
befallen	17
them	17
in	17
their	17
search	17
for	17
the	17
ass,	17
each	17
crying	17
up	17
the	17
other’s	17
perfection	17
in	17
braying.	17
The	17
whole	17
story	17
came	17
to	17
be	17
known	17
and	17
spread	17
abroad	17
through	17
the	17
villages	17
of	17
the	17
neighbourhood;	17
and	17
the	17
devil,	17
who	17
never	17
sleeps,	17
with	17
his	17
love	17
for	17
sowing	17
dissensions	17
and	17
scattering	17
discord	17
everywhere,	17
blowing	17
mischief	17
about	17
and	17
making	17
quarrels	17
out	17
of	17
nothing,	17
contrived	17
to	17
make	17
the	17
people	17
of	17
the	17
other	17
towns	17
fall	17
to	17
braying	17
whenever	17
they	17
saw	17
anyone	17
from	17
our	17
village,	17
as	17
if	17
to	17
throw	17
the	17
braying	17
of	17
our	17
regidors	17
in	17
our	17
teeth.	17
Then	17
the	17
boys	17
took	17
to	17
it,	17
which	17
was	17
the	17
same	17
thing	17
for	17
it	17
as	17
getting	17
into	17
the	17
hands	17
and	17
mouths	17
of	17
all	17
the	17
devils	17
of	17
hell;	17
and	17
braying	17
spread	17
from	17
one	17
town	17
to	17
another	17
in	17
such	17
a	17
way	17
that	17
the	17
men	17
of	17
the	17
braying	17
town	17
are	17
as	17
easy	17
to	17
be	17
known	17
as	17
blacks	17
are	17
to	17
be	17
known	17
from	17
whites,	17
and	17
the	17
unlucky	17
joke	17
has	17
gone	17
so	17
far	17
that	17
several	17
times	17
the	17
scoffed	17
have	17
come	17
out	17
in	17
arms	17
and	17
in	17
a	17
body	17
to	17
do	17
battle	17
with	17
the	17
scoffers,	17
and	17
neither	17
king	17
nor	17
rook,	17
fear	17
nor	17
shame,	17
can	17
mend	17
matters.	17
To-morrow	17
or	17
the	17
day	17
after,	17
I	17
believe,	17
the	17
men	17
of	17
my	17
town,	17
that	17
is,	17
of	17
the	17
braying	17
town,	17
are	17
going	17
to	17
take	17
the	17
field	17
against	17
another	17
village	17
two	17
leagues	17
away	17
from	17
ours,	17
one	17
of	17
those	17
that	17
persecute	17
us	17
most;	17
and	17
that	17
we	17
may	17
turn	17
out	17
well	17
prepared	17
I	17
have	17
bought	17
these	17
lances	17
and	17
halberds	17
you	17
have	17
seen.	17
These	17
are	17
the	17
curious	17
things	17
I	17
told	17
you	17
I	17
had	17
to	17
tell,	17
and	17
if	17
you	17
don’t	17
think	17
them	17
so,	17
I	17
have	17
got	17
no	17
others;”	17
and	17
with	17
this	17
the	17
worthy	17
fellow	17
brought	17
his	17
story	17
to	17
a	17
close.	17
Just	17
at	17
this	17
moment	17
there	17
came	17
in	17
at	17
the	17
gate	17
of	17
the	17
inn	17
a	17
man	17
entirely	17
clad	17
in	17
chamois	17
leather,	17
hose,	17
breeches,	17
and	17
doublet,	17
who	17
said	17
in	17
a	17
loud	17
voice,	17
“Señor	17
host,	17
have	17
you	17
room?	17
Here’s	17
the	17
divining	17
ape	17
and	17
the	17
show	17
of	17
the	17
Release	17
of	17
Melisendra	17
just	17
coming.”	17
“Ods	17
body!”	17
said	17
the	17
landlord,	17
“why,	17
it’s	17
Master	17
Pedro!	17
We’re	17
in	17
for	17
a	17
grand	17
night!”	17
I	17
forgot	17
to	17
mention	17
that	17
the	17
said	17
Master	17
Pedro	17
had	17
his	17
left	17
eye	17
and	17
nearly	17
half	17
his	17
cheek	17
covered	17
with	17
a	17
patch	17
of	17
green	17
taffety,	17
showing	17
that	17
something	17
ailed	17
all	17
that	17
side.	17
“Your	17
worship	17
is	17
welcome,	17
Master	17
Pedro,”	17
continued	17
the	17
landlord;	17
“but	17
where	17
are	17
the	17
ape	17
and	17
the	17
show,	17
for	17
I	17
don’t	17
see	17
them?”	17
“They	17
are	17
close	17
at	17
hand,”	17
said	17
he	17
in	17
the	17
chamois	17
leather,	17
“but	17
I	17
came	17
on	17
first	17
to	17
know	17
if	17
there	17
was	17
any	17
room.”	17
“I’d	17
make	17
the	17
Duke	17
of	17
Alva	17
himself	17
clear	17
out	17
to	17
make	17
room	17
for	17
Master	17
Pedro,”	17
said	17
the	17
landlord;	17
“bring	17
in	17
the	17
ape	17
and	17
the	17
show;	17
there’s	17
company	17
in	17
the	17
inn	17
to-night	17
that	17
will	17
pay	17
to	17
see	17
that	17
and	17
the	17
cleverness	17
of	17
the	17
ape.”	17
“So	17
be	17
it	17
by	17
all	17
means,”	17
said	17
the	17
man	17
with	17
the	17
patch;	17
“I’ll	17
lower	17
the	17
price,	17
and	17
be	17
well	17
satisfied	17
if	17
I	17
only	17
pay	17
my	17
expenses;	17
and	17
now	17
I’ll	17
go	17
back	17
and	17
hurry	17
on	17
the	17
cart	17
with	17
the	17
ape	17
and	17
the	17
show;”	17
and	17
with	17
this	17
he	17
went	17
out	17
of	17
the	17
inn.	17
Don	17
Quixote	17
at	17
once	17
asked	17
the	17
landlord	17
what	17
this	17
Master	17
Pedro	17
was,	17
and	17
what	17
was	17
the	17
show	17
and	17
what	17
was	17
the	17
ape	17
he	17
had	17
with	17
him;	17
which	17
the	17
landlord	17
replied,	17
“This	17
is	17
a	17
famous	17
puppet-showman,	17
who	17
for	17
some	17
time	17
past	17
has	17
been	17
going	17
about	17
this	17
Mancha	17
de	17
Aragon,	17
exhibiting	17
a	17
show	17
of	17
the	17
release	17
of	17
Melisendra	17
by	17
the	17
famous	17
Don	17
Gaiferos,	17
one	17
of	17
the	17
best	17
and	17
best-represented	17
stories	17
that	17
have	17
been	17
seen	17
in	17
this	17
part	17
of	17
the	17
kingdom	17
for	17
many	17
a	17
year;	17
he	17
has	17
also	17
with	17
him	17
an	17
ape	17
with	17
the	17
most	17
extraordinary	17
gift	17
ever	17
seen	17
in	17
an	17
ape	17
or	17
imagined	17
in	17
a	17
human	17
being;	17
for	17
if	17
you	17
ask	17
him	17
anything,	17
he	17
listens	17
attentively	17
to	17
the	17
question,	17
and	17
then	17
jumps	17
on	17
his	17
master’s	17
shoulder,	17
and	17
pressing	17
close	17
to	17
his	17
ear	17
tells	17
him	17
the	17
answer	17
which	17
Master	17
Pedro	17
then	17
delivers.	17
He	17
says	17
a	17
great	17
deal	17
more	17
about	17
things	17
past	17
than	17
about	17
things	17
to	17
come;	17
and	17
though	17
he	17
does	17
not	17
always	17
hit	17
the	17
truth	17
in	17
every	17
case,	17
most	17
times	17
he	17
is	17
not	17
far	17
wrong,	17
so	17
that	17
he	17
makes	17
us	17
fancy	17
he	17
has	17
got	17
the	17
devil	17
in	17
him.	17
He	17
gets	17
two	17
reals	17
for	17
every	17
question	17
if	17
the	17
ape	17
answers;	17
I	17
mean	17
if	17
his	17
master	17
answers	17
for	17
him	17
after	17
he	17
has	17
whispered	17
into	17
his	17
ear;	17
and	17
so	17
it	17
is	17
believed	17
that	17
this	17
same	17
Master	17
Pedro	17
is	17
very	17
rich.	17
He	17
is	17
a	17
‘gallant	17
man’	17
as	17
they	17
say	17
in	17
Italy,	17
and	17
good	17
company,	17
and	17
leads	17
the	17
finest	17
life	17
in	17
the	17
world;	17
talks	17
more	17
than	17
six,	17
drinks	17
more	17
than	17
a	17
dozen,	17
and	17
all	17
by	17
his	17
tongue,	17
and	17
his	17
ape,	17
and	17
his	17
show.”	17
Master	17
Pedro	17
now	17
came	17
back,	17
and	17
in	17
a	17
cart	17
followed	17
the	17
show	17
and	17
the	17
ape—a	17
big	17
one,	17
without	17
a	17
tail	17
and	17
with	17
buttocks	17
as	17
bare	17
as	17
felt,	17
but	17
not	17
vicious-looking.	17
As	17
soon	17
as	17
Don	17
Quixote	17
saw	17
him,	17
he	17
asked	17
him,	17
“Can	17
you	17
tell	17
me,	17
sir	17
fortune-teller,	17
what	17
fish	17
do	17
we	17
catch,	17
and	17
how	17
will	17
it	17
be	17
with	17
us?	17
See,	17
here	17
are	17
my	17
two	17
reals,”	17
and	17
he	17
bade	17
Sancho	17
give	17
them	17
to	17
Master	17
Pedro;	17
but	17
he	17
answered	17
for	17
the	17
ape	17
and	17
said,	17
“Señor,	17
this	17
animal	17
does	17
not	17
give	17
any	17
answer	17
or	17
information	17
touching	17
things	17
that	17
are	17
to	17
come;	17
of	17
things	17
past	17
he	17
knows	17
something,	17
and	17
more	17
or	17
less	17
of	17
things	17
present.”	17
“Gad,”	17
said	17
Sancho,	17
“I	17
would	17
not	17
give	17
a	17
farthing	17
to	17
be	17
told	17
what’s	17
past	17
with	17
me,	17
for	17
who	17
knows	17
that	17
better	17
than	17
I	17
do	17
myself?	17
And	17
to	17
pay	17
for	17
being	17
told	17
what	17
I	17
know	17
would	17
be	17
mighty	17
foolish.	17
But	17
as	17
you	17
know	17
things	17
present,	17
here	17
are	17
my	17
two	17
reals,	17
and	17
tell	17
me,	17
most	17
excellent	17
sir	17
ape,	17
what	17
is	17
my	17
wife	17
Teresa	17
Panza	17
doing	17
now,	17
and	17
what	17
is	17
she	17
diverting	17
herself	17
with?”	17
Master	17
Pedro	17
refused	17
to	17
take	17
the	17
money,	17
saying,	17
“I	17
will	17
not	17
receive	17
payment	17
in	17
advance	17
or	17
until	17
the	17
service	17
has	17
been	17
first	17
rendered;”	17
and	17
then	17
with	17
his	17
right	17
hand	17
he	17
gave	17
a	17
couple	17
of	17
slaps	17
on	17
his	17
left	17
shoulder,	17
and	17
with	17
one	17
spring	17
the	17
ape	17
perched	17
himself	17
upon	17
it,	17
and	17
putting	17
his	17
mouth	17
to	17
his	17
master’s	17
ear	17
began	17
chattering	17
his	17
teeth	17
rapidly;	17
and	17
having	17
kept	17
this	17
up	17
as	17
long	17
as	17
one	17
would	17
be	17
saying	17
a	17
credo,	17
with	17
another	17
spring	17
he	17
brought	17
himself	17
to	17
the	17
ground,	17
and	17
the	17
same	17
instant	17
Master	17
Pedro	17
ran	17
in	17
great	17
haste	17
and	17
fell	17
upon	17
his	17
knees	17
before	17
Don	17
Quixote,	17
and	17
embracing	17
his	17
legs	17
exclaimed,	17
“These	17
legs	17
do	17
I	17
embrace	17
as	17
I	17
would	17
embrace	17
the	17
two	17
pillars	17
of	17
Hercules,	17
O	17
illustrious	17
reviver	17
of	17
knight-errantry,	17
so	17
long	17
consigned	17
to	17
oblivion!	17
O	17
never	17
yet	17
duly	17
extolled	17
knight,	17
Don	17
Quixote	17
of	17
La	17
Mancha,	17
courage	17
of	17
the	17
faint-hearted,	17
prop	17
of	17
the	17
tottering,	17
arm	17
of	17
the	17
fallen,	17
staff	17
and	17
counsel	17
of	17
all	17
who	17
are	17
unfortunate!”	17

Size	17
Don	17
Quixote	17
was	17
thunderstruck,	17
Sancho	17
astounded,	17
the	17
cousin	17
staggered,	17
the	17
page	17
astonished,	17
the	17
man	17
from	17
the	17
braying	17
town	17
agape,	17
the	17
landlord	17
in	17
perplexity,	17
and,	17
in	17
short,	17
everyone	17
amazed	17
at	17
the	17
words	17
of	17
the	17
puppet-showman,	17
who	17
went	17
on	17
to	17
say,	17
“And	17
thou,	17
worthy	17
Sancho	17
Panza,	17
the	17
best	17
squire	17
and	17
squire	17
to	17
the	17
best	17
knight	17
in	17
the	17
world!	17
Be	17
of	17
good	17
cheer,	17
for	17
thy	17
good	17
wife	17
Teresa	17
is	17
well,	17
and	17
she	17
is	17
at	17
this	17
moment	17
hackling	17
a	17
pound	17
of	17
flax;	17
and	17
more	17
by	17
token	17
she	17
has	17
at	17
her	17
left	17
hand	17
a	17
jug	17
with	17
a	17
broken	17
spout	17
that	17
holds	17
a	17
good	17
drop	17
of	17
wine,	17
with	17
which	17
she	17
solaces	17
herself	17
at	17
her	17
work.”	17
“That	17
I	17
can	17
well	17
believe,”	17
said	17
Sancho.	17
“She	17
is	17
a	17
lucky	17
one,	17
and	17
if	17
it	17
was	17
not	17
for	17
her	17
jealousy	17
I	17
would	17
not	17
change	17
her	17
for	17
the	17
giantess	17
Andandona,	17
who	17
by	17
my	17
master’s	17
account	17
was	17
a	17
very	17
clever	17
and	17
worthy	17
woman;	17
my	17
Teresa	17
is	17
one	17
of	17
those	17
that	17
won’t	17
let	17
themselves	17
want	17
for	17
anything,	17
though	17
their	17
heirs	17
may	17
have	17
to	17
pay	17
for	17
it.”	17
“Now	17
I	17
declare,”	17
said	17
Don	17
Quixote,	17
“he	17
who	17
reads	17
much	17
and	17
travels	17
much	17
sees	17
and	17
knows	17
a	17
great	17
deal.	17
I	17
say	17
so	17
because	17
what	17
amount	17
of	17
persuasion	17
could	17
have	17
persuaded	17
me	17
that	17
there	17
are	17
apes	17
in	17
the	17
world	17
that	17
can	17
divine	17
as	17
I	17
have	17
seen	17
now	17
with	17
my	17
own	17
eyes?	17
For	17
I	17
am	17
that	17
very	17
Don	17
Quixote	17
of	17
La	17
Mancha	17
this	17
worthy	17
animal	17
refers	17
to,	17
though	17
he	17
has	17
gone	17
rather	17
too	17
far	17
in	17
my	17
praise;	17
but	17
whatever	17
I	17
may	17
be,	17
I	17
thank	17
heaven	17
that	17
it	17
has	17
endowed	17
me	17
with	17
a	17
tender	17
and	17
compassionate	17
heart,	17
always	17
disposed	17
to	17
do	17
good	17
to	17
all	17
and	17
harm	17
to	17
none.”	17
“If	17
I	17
had	17
money,”	17
said	17
the	17
page,	17
“I	17
would	17
ask	17
señor	17
ape	17
what	17
will	17
happen	17
to	17
me	17
in	17
the	17
peregrination	17
I	17
am	17
making.”	17
To	17
this	17
Master	17
Pedro,	17
who	17
had	17
by	17
this	17
time	17
risen	17
from	17
Don	17
Quixote’s	17
feet,	17
replied,	17
“I	17
have	17
already	17
said	17
that	17
this	17
little	17
beast	17
gives	17
no	17
answer	17
as	17
to	17
the	17
future;	17
but	17
if	17
he	17
did,	17
not	17
having	17
money	17
would	17
be	17
of	17
no	17
consequence,	17
for	17
to	17
oblige	17
Señor	17
Don	17
Quixote,	17
here	17
present,	17
I	17
would	17
give	17
up	17
all	17
the	17
profits	17
in	17
the	17
world.	17
And	17
now,	17
because	17
I	17
have	17
promised	17
it,	17
and	17
to	17
afford	17
him	17
pleasure,	17
I	17
will	17
set	17
up	17
my	17
show	17
and	17
offer	17
entertainment	17
to	17
all	17
who	17
are	17
in	17
the	17
inn,	17
without	17
any	17
charge	17
whatever.”	17
As	17
soon	17
as	17
he	17
heard	17
this,	17
the	17
landlord,	17
delighted	17
beyond	17
measure,	17
pointed	17
out	17
a	17
place	17
where	17
the	17
show	17
might	17
be	17
fixed,	17
which	17
was	17
done	17
at	17
once.	17
Don	17
Quixote	17
was	17
not	17
very	17
well	17
satisfied	17
with	17
the	17
divinations	17
of	17
the	17
ape,	17
as	17
he	17
did	17
not	17
think	17
it	17
proper	17
that	17
an	17
ape	17
should	17
divine	17
anything,	17
either	17
past	17
or	17
future;	17
so	17
while	17
Master	17
Pedro	17
was	17
arranging	17
the	17
show,	17
he	17
retired	17
with	17
Sancho	17
into	17
a	17
corner	17
of	17
the	17
stable,	17
where,	17
without	17
being	17
overheard	17
by	17
anyone,	17
he	17
said	17
to	17
him,	17
“Look	17
here,	17
Sancho,	17
I	17
have	17
been	17
seriously	17
thinking	17
over	17
this	17
ape’s	17
extraordinary	17
gift,	17
and	17
have	17
come	17
to	17
the	17
conclusion	17
that	17
beyond	17
doubt	17
this	17
Master	17
Pedro,	17
his	17
master,	17
has	17
a	17
pact,	17
tacit	17
or	17
express,	17
with	17
the	17
devil.”	17
“If	17
the	17
packet	17
is	17
express	17
from	17
the	17
devil,”	17
said	17
Sancho,	17
“it	17
must	17
be	17
a	17
very	17
dirty	17
packet	17
no	17
doubt;	17
but	17
what	17
good	17
can	17
it	17
do	17
Master	17
Pedro	17
to	17
have	17
such	17
packets?”	17
“Thou	17
dost	17
not	17
understand	17
me,	17
Sancho,”	17
said	17
Don	17
Quixote;	17
“I	17
only	17
mean	17
he	17
must	17
have	17
made	17
some	17
compact	17
with	17
the	17
devil	17
to	17
infuse	17
this	17
power	17
into	17
the	17
ape,	17
that	17
he	17
may	17
get	17
his	17
living,	17
and	17
after	17
he	17
has	17
grown	17
rich	17
he	17
will	17
give	17
him	17
his	17
soul,	17
which	17
is	17
what	17
the	17
enemy	17
of	17
mankind	17
wants;	17
this	17
I	17
am	17
led	17
to	17
believe	17
by	17
observing	17
that	17
the	17
ape	17
only	17
answers	17
about	17
things	17
past	17
or	17
present,	17
and	17
the	17
devil’s	17
knowledge	17
extends	17
no	17
further;	17
for	17
the	17
future	17
he	17
knows	17
only	17
by	17
guesswork,	17
and	17
that	17
not	17
always;	17
for	17
it	17
is	17
reserved	17
for	17
God	17
alone	17
to	17
know	17
the	17
times	17
and	17
the	17
seasons,	17
and	17
for	17
him	17
there	17
is	17
neither	17
past	17
nor	17
future;	17
all	17
is	17
present.	17
This	17
being	17
as	17
it	17
is,	17
it	17
is	17
clear	17
that	17
this	17
ape	17
speaks	17
by	17
the	17
spirit	17
of	17
the	17
devil;	17
and	17
I	17
am	17
astonished	17
they	17
have	17
not	17
denounced	17
him	17
to	17
the	17
Holy	17
Office,	17
and	17
put	17
him	17
to	17
the	17
question,	17
and	17
forced	17
it	17
out	17
of	17
him	17
by	17
whose	17
virtue	17
it	17
is	17
that	17
he	17
divines;	17
because	17
it	17
is	17
certain	17
this	17
ape	17
is	17
not	17
an	17
astrologer;	17
neither	17
his	17
master	17
nor	17
he	17
sets	17
up,	17
or	17
knows	17
how	17
to	17
set	17
up,	17
those	17
figures	17
they	17
call	17
judiciary,	17
which	17
are	17
now	17
so	17
common	17
in	17
Spain	17
that	17
there	17
is	17
not	17
a	17
jade,	17
or	17
page,	17
or	17
old	17
cobbler,	17
that	17
will	17
not	17
undertake	17
to	17
set	17
up	17
a	17
figure	17
as	17
readily	17
as	17
pick	17
up	17
a	17
knave	17
of	17
cards	17
from	17
the	17
ground,	17
bringing	17
to	17
nought	17
the	17
marvellous	17
truth	17
of	17
the	17
science	17
by	17
their	17
lies	17
and	17
ignorance.	17
I	17
know	17
of	17
a	17
lady	17
who	17
asked	17
one	17
of	17
these	17
figure	17
schemers	17
whether	17
her	17
little	17
lap-dog	17
would	17
be	17
in	17
pup	17
and	17
would	17
breed,	17
and	17
how	17
many	17
and	17
of	17
what	17
colour	17
the	17
little	17
pups	17
would	17
be.	17
To	17
which	17
señor	17
astrologer,	17
after	17
having	17
set	17
up	17
his	17
figure,	17
made	17
answer	17
that	17
the	17
bitch	17
would	17
be	17
in	17
pup,	17
and	17
would	17
drop	17
three	17
pups,	17
one	17
green,	17
another	17
bright	17
red,	17
and	17
the	17
third	17
parti-coloured,	17
provided	17
she	17
conceived	17
between	17
eleven	17
and	17
twelve	17
either	17
of	17
the	17
day	17
or	17
night,	17
and	17
on	17
a	17
Monday	17
or	17
Saturday;	17
but	17
as	17
things	17
turned	17
out,	17
two	17
days	17
after	17
this	17
the	17
bitch	17
died	17
of	17
a	17
surfeit,	17
and	17
señor	17
planet-ruler	17
had	17
the	17
credit	17
all	17
over	17
the	17
place	17
of	17
being	17
a	17
most	17
profound	17
astrologer,	17
as	17
most	17
of	17
these	17
planet-rulers	17
have.”	17
“Still,”	17
said	17
Sancho,	17
“I	17
would	17
be	17
glad	17
if	17
your	17
worship	17
would	17
make	17
Master	17
Pedro	17
ask	17
his	17
ape	17
whether	17
what	17
happened	17
your	17
worship	17
in	17
the	17
cave	17
of	17
Montesinos	17
is	17
true;	17
for,	17
begging	17
your	17
worship’s	17
pardon,	17
I,	17
for	17
my	17
part,	17
take	17
it	17
to	17
have	17
been	17
all	17
flam	17
and	17
lies,	17
or	17
at	17
any	17
rate	17
something	17
you	17
dreamt.”	17
“That	17
may	17
be,”	17
replied	17
Don	17
Quixote;	17
“however,	17
I	17
will	17
do	17
what	17
you	17
suggest;	17
though	17
I	17
have	17
my	17
own	17
scruples	17
about	17
it.”	17
At	17
this	17
point	17
Master	17
Pedro	17
came	17
up	17
in	17
quest	17
of	17
Don	17
Quixote,	17
to	17
tell	17
him	17
the	17
show	17
was	17
now	17
ready	17
and	17
to	17
come	17
and	17
see	17
it,	17
for	17
it	17
was	17
worth	17
seeing.	17
Don	17
Quixote	17
explained	17
his	17
wish,	17
and	17
begged	17
him	17
to	17
ask	17
his	17
ape	17
at	17
once	17
to	17
tell	17
him	17
whether	17
certain	17
things	17
which	17
had	17
happened	17
to	17
him	17
in	17
the	17
cave	17
of	17
Montesinos	17
were	17
dreams	17
or	17
realities,	17
for	17
to	17
him	17
they	17
appeared	17
to	17
partake	17
of	17
both.	17
Upon	17
this	17
Master	17
Pedro,	17
without	17
answering,	17
went	17
back	17
to	17
fetch	17
the	17
ape,	17
and,	17
having	17
placed	17
it	17
in	17
front	17
of	17
Don	17
Quixote	17
and	17
Sancho,	17
said:	17
“See	17
here,	17
señor	17
ape,	17
this	17
gentleman	17
wishes	17
to	17
know	17
whether	17
certain	17
things	17
which	17
happened	17
to	17
him	17
in	17
the	17
cave	17
called	17
the	17
cave	17
of	17
Montesinos	17
were	17
false	17
or	17
true.”	17
On	17
his	17
making	17
the	17
usual	17
sign	17
the	17
ape	17
mounted	17
on	17
his	17
left	17
shoulder	17
and	17
seemed	17
to	17
whisper	17
in	17
his	17
ear,	17
and	17
Master	17
Pedro	17
said	17
at	17
once,	17
“The	17
ape	17
says	17
that	17
the	17
things	17
you	17
saw	17
or	17
that	17
happened	17
to	17
you	17
in	17
that	17
cave	17
are,	17
part	17
of	17
them	17
false,	17
part	17
true;	17
and	17
that	17
he	17
only	17
knows	17
this	17
and	17
no	17
more	17
as	17
regards	17
this	17
question;	17
but	17
if	17
your	17
worship	17
wishes	17
to	17
know	17
more,	17
on	17
Friday	17
next	17
he	17
will	17
answer	17
all	17
that	17
may	17
be	17
asked	17
him,	17
for	17
his	17
virtue	17
is	17
at	17
present	17
exhausted,	17
and	17
will	17
not	17
return	17
to	17
him	17
till	17
Friday,	17
as	17
he	17
has	17
said.”	17
“Did	17
I	17
not	17
say,	17
señor,”	17
said	17
Sancho,	17
“that	17
I	17
could	17
not	17
bring	17
myself	17
to	17
believe	17
that	17
all	17
your	17
worship	17
said	17
about	17
the	17
adventures	17
in	17
the	17
cave	17
was	17
true,	17
or	17
even	17
the	17
half	17
of	17
it?”	17
“The	17
course	17
of	17
events	17
will	17
tell,	17
Sancho,”	17
replied	17
Don	17
Quixote;	17
“time,	17
that	17
discloses	17
all	17
things,	17
leaves	17
nothing	17
that	17
it	17
does	17
not	17
drag	17
into	17
the	17
light	17
of	17
day,	17
though	17
it	17
be	17
buried	17
in	17
the	17
bosom	17
of	17
the	17
earth.	17
But	17
enough	17
of	17
that	17
for	17
the	17
present;	17
let	17
us	17
go	17
and	17
see	17
Master	17
Pedro’s	17
show,	17
for	17
I	17
am	17
sure	17
there	17
must	17
be	17
something	17
novel	17
in	17
it.”	17
“Something!”	17
said	17
Master	17
Pedro;	17
“this	17
show	17
of	17
mine	17
has	17
sixty	17
thousand	17
novel	17
things	17
in	17
it;	17
let	17
me	17
tell	17
you,	17
Señor	17
Don	17
Quixote,	17
it	17
is	17
one	17
of	17
the	17
best-worth-seeing	17
things	17
in	17
the	17
world	17
this	17
day;	17
but	17
_operibus	17
credite	17
et	17
non	17
verbis_,	17
and	17
now	17
let’s	17
get	17
to	17
work,	17
for	17
it	17
is	17
growing	17
late,	17
and	17
we	17
have	17
a	17
great	17
deal	17
to	17
do	17
and	17
to	17
say	17
and	17
show.”	17
Don	17
Quixote	17
and	17
Sancho	17
obeyed	17
him	17
and	17
went	17
to	17
where	17
the	17
show	17
was	17
already	17
put	17
up	17
and	17
uncovered,	17
set	17
all	17
around	17
with	17
lighted	17
wax	17
tapers	17
which	17
made	17
it	17
look	17
splendid	17
and	17
bright.	17
When	17
they	17
came	17
to	17
it	17
Master	17
Pedro	17
ensconced	17
himself	17
inside	17
it,	17
for	17
it	17
was	17
he	17
who	17
had	17
to	17
work	17
the	17
puppets,	17
and	17
a	17
boy,	17
a	17
servant	17
of	17
his,	17
posted	17
himself	17
outside	17
to	17
act	17
as	17
showman	17
and	17
explain	17
the	17
mysteries	17
of	17
the	17
exhibition,	17
having	17
a	17
wand	17
in	17
his	17
hand	17
to	17
point	17
to	17
the	17
figures	17
as	17
they	17
came	17
out.	17
And	17
so,	17
all	17

All	17
were	17
silent,	17
Tyrians	17
and	17
Trojans;	17
I	17
mean	17
all	17
who	17
were	17
watching	17
the	17
show	17
were	17
hanging	17
on	17
the	17
lips	17
of	17
the	17
interpreter	17
of	17
its	17
wonders,	17
when	17
drums	17
and	17
trumpets	17
were	17
heard	17
to	17
sound	17
inside	17
it	17
and	17
cannon	17
to	17
go	17
off.	17
The	17
noise	17
was	17
soon	17
over,	17
and	17
then	17
the	17
boy	17
lifted	17
up	17
his	17
voice	17
and	17
said,	17
“This	17
true	17
story	17
which	17
is	17
here	17
represented	17
to	17
your	17
worships	17
is	17
taken	17
word	17
for	17
word	17
from	17
the	17
French	17
chronicles	17
and	17
from	17
the	17
Spanish	17
ballads	17
that	17
are	17
in	17
everybody’s	17
mouth,	17
and	17
in	17
the	17
mouth	17
of	17
the	17
boys	17
about	17
the	17
streets.	17
Its	17
subject	17
is	17
the	17
release	17
by	17
Señor	17
Don	17
Gaiferos	17
of	17
his	17
wife	17
Melisendra,	17
when	17
a	17
captive	17
in	17
Spain	17
at	17
the	17
hands	17
of	17
the	17
Moors	17
in	17
the	17
city	17
of	17
Sansueña,	17
for	17
so	17
they	17
called	17
then	17
what	17
is	17
now	17
called	17
Saragossa;	17
and	17
there	17
you	17
may	17
see	17
how	17
Don	17
Gaiferos	17
is	17
playing	17
at	17
the	17
tables,	17
just	17
as	17
they	17
sing	17
it-	17
At	17
tables	17
playing	17
Don	17
Gaiferos	17
sits,	17
For	17
Melisendra	17
is	17
forgotten	17
now.	17
And	17
that	17
personage	17
who	17
appears	17
there	17
with	17
a	17
crown	17
on	17
his	17
head	17
and	17
a	17
sceptre	17
in	17
his	17
hand	17
is	17
the	17
Emperor	17
Charlemagne,	17
the	17
supposed	17
father	17
of	17
Melisendra,	17
who,	17
angered	17
to	17
see	17
his	17
son-in-law’s	17
inaction	17
and	17
unconcern,	17
comes	17
in	17
to	17
chide	17
him;	17
and	17
observe	17
with	17
what	17
vehemence	17
and	17
energy	17
he	17
chides	17
him,	17
so	17
that	17
you	17
would	17
fancy	17
he	17
was	17
going	17
to	17
give	17
him	17
half	17
a	17
dozen	17
raps	17
with	17
his	17
sceptre;	17
and	17
indeed	17
there	17
are	17
authors	17
who	17
say	17
he	17
did	17
give	17
them,	17
and	17
sound	17
ones	17
too;	17
and	17
after	17
having	17
said	17
a	17
great	17
deal	17
to	17
him	17
about	17
imperilling	17
his	17
honour	17
by	17
not	17
effecting	17
the	17
release	17
of	17
his	17
wife,	17
he	17
said,	17
so	17
the	17
tale	17
runs,	17
Enough	17
I’ve	17
said,	17
see	17
to	17
it	17
now.	17
Observe,	17
too,	17
how	17
the	17
emperor	17
turns	17
away,	17
and	17
leaves	17
Don	17
Gaiferos	17
fuming;	17
and	17
you	17
see	17
now	17
how	17
in	17
a	17
burst	17
of	17
anger,	17
he	17
flings	17
the	17
table	17
and	17
the	17
board	17
far	17
from	17
him	17
and	17
calls	17
in	17
haste	17
for	17
his	17
armour,	17
and	17
asks	17
his	17
cousin	17
Don	17
Roland	17
for	17
the	17
loan	17
of	17
his	17
sword,	17
Durindana,	17
and	17
how	17
Don	17
Roland	17
refuses	17
to	17
lend	17
it,	17
offering	17
him	17
his	17
company	17
in	17
the	17
difficult	17
enterprise	17
he	17
is	17
undertaking;	17
but	17
he,	17
in	17
his	17
valour	17
and	17
anger,	17
will	17
not	17
accept	17
it,	17
and	17
says	17
that	17
he	17
alone	17
will	17
suffice	17
to	17
rescue	17
his	17
wife,	17
even	17
though	17
she	17
were	17
imprisoned	17
deep	17
in	17
the	17
centre	17
of	17
the	17
earth,	17
and	17
with	17
this	17
he	17
retires	17
to	17
arm	17
himself	17
and	17
set	17
out	17
on	17
his	17
journey	17
at	17
once.	17
Now	17
let	17
your	17
worships	17
turn	17
your	17
eyes	17
to	17
that	17
tower	17
that	17
appears	17
there,	17
which	17
is	17
supposed	17
to	17
be	17
one	17
of	17
the	17
towers	17
of	17
the	17
alcazar	17
of	17
Saragossa,	17
now	17
called	17
the	17
Aljaferia;	17
that	17
lady	17
who	17
appears	17
on	17
that	17
balcony	17
dressed	17
in	17
Moorish	17
fashion	17
is	17
the	17
peerless	17
Melisendra,	17
for	17
many	17
a	17
time	17
she	17
used	17
to	17
gaze	17
from	17
thence	17
upon	17
the	17
road	17
to	17
France,	17
and	17
seek	17
consolation	17
in	17
her	17
captivity	17
by	17
thinking	17
of	17
Paris	17
and	17
her	17
husband.	17
Observe,	17
too,	17
a	17
new	17
incident	17
which	17
now	17
occurs,	17
such	17
as,	17
perhaps,	17
never	17
was	17
seen.	17
Do	17
you	17
not	17
see	17
that	17
Moor,	17
who	17
silently	17
and	17
stealthily,	17
with	17
his	17
finger	17
on	17
his	17
lip,	17
approaches	17
Melisendra	17
from	17
behind?	17
Observe	17
now	17
how	17
he	17
prints	17
a	17
kiss	17
upon	17
her	17
lips,	17
and	17
what	17
a	17
hurry	17
she	17
is	17
in	17
to	17
spit,	17
and	17
wipe	17
them	17
with	17
the	17
white	17
sleeve	17
of	17
her	17
smock,	17
and	17
how	17
she	17
bewails	17
herself,	17
and	17
tears	17
her	17
fair	17
hair	17
as	17
though	17
it	17
were	17
to	17
blame	17
for	17
the	17
wrong.	17
Observe,	17
too,	17
that	17
the	17
stately	17
Moor	17
who	17
is	17
in	17
that	17
corridor	17
is	17
King	17
Marsilio	17
of	17
Sansueña,	17
who,	17
having	17
seen	17
the	17
Moor’s	17
insolence,	17
at	17
once	17
orders	17
him	17
(though	17
his	17
kinsman	17
and	17
a	17
great	17
favourite	17
of	17
his)	17
to	17
be	17
seized	17
and	17
given	17
two	17
hundred	17
lashes,	17
while	17
carried	17
through	17
the	17
streets	17
of	17
the	17
city	17
according	17
to	17
custom,	17
with	17
criers	17
going	17
before	17
him	17
and	17
officers	17
of	17
justice	17
behind;	17
and	17
here	17
you	17
see	17
them	17
come	17
out	17
to	17
execute	17
the	17
sentence,	17
although	17
the	17
offence	17
has	17
been	17
scarcely	17
committed;	17
for	17
among	17
the	17
Moors	17
there	17
are	17
no	17
indictments	17
nor	17
remands	17
as	17
with	17
us.”	17
Here	17
Don	17
Quixote	17
called	17
out,	17
“Child,	17
child,	17
go	17
straight	17
on	17
with	17
your	17
story,	17
and	17
don’t	17
run	17
into	17
curves	17
and	17
slants,	17
for	17
to	17
establish	17
a	17
fact	17
clearly	17
there	17
is	17
need	17
of	17
a	17
great	17
deal	17
of	17
proof	17
and	17
confirmation;”	17
and	17
said	17
Master	17
Pedro	17
from	17
within,	17
“Boy,	17
stick	17
to	17
your	17
text	17
and	17
do	17
as	17
the	17
gentleman	17
bids	17
you;	17
it’s	17
the	17
best	17
plan;	17
keep	17
to	17
your	17
plain	17
song,	17
and	17
don’t	17
attempt	17
harmonies,	17
for	17
they	17
are	17
apt	17
to	17
break	17
down	17
from	17
being	17
over	17
fine.”	17
“I	17
will,”	17
said	17
the	17
boy,	17
and	17
he	17
went	17
on	17
to	17
say,	17
“This	17
figure	17
that	17
you	17
see	17
here	17
on	17
horseback,	17
covered	17
with	17
a	17
Gascon	17
cloak,	17
is	17
Don	17
Gaiferos	17
himself,	17
whom	17
his	17
wife,	17
now	17
avenged	17
of	17
the	17
insult	17
of	17
the	17
amorous	17
Moor,	17
and	17
taking	17
her	17
stand	17
on	17
the	17
balcony	17
of	17
the	17
tower	17
with	17
a	17
calmer	17
and	17
more	17
tranquil	17
countenance,	17
has	17
perceived	17
without	17
recognising	17
him;	17
and	17
she	17
addresses	17
her	17
husband,	17
supposing	17
him	17
to	17
be	17
some	17
traveller,	17
and	17
holds	17
with	17
him	17
all	17
that	17
conversation	17
and	17
colloquy	17
in	17
the	17
ballad	17
that	17
runs—	17
If	17
you,	17
sir	17
knight,	17
to	17
France	17
are	17
bound,	17
Oh!	17
for	17
Gaiferos	17
ask—	17
which	17
I	17
do	17
not	17
repeat	17
here	17
because	17
prolixity	17
begets	17
disgust;	17
suffice	17
it	17
to	17
observe	17
how	17
Don	17
Gaiferos	17
discovers	17
himself,	17
and	17
that	17
by	17
her	17
joyful	17
gestures	17
Melisendra	17
shows	17
us	17
she	17
has	17
recognised	17
him;	17
and	17
what	17
is	17
more,	17
we	17
now	17
see	17
she	17
lowers	17
herself	17
from	17
the	17
balcony	17
to	17
place	17
herself	17
on	17
the	17
haunches	17
of	17
her	17
good	17
husband’s	17
horse.	17
But	17
ah!	17
unhappy	17
lady,	17
the	17
edge	17
of	17
her	17
petticoat	17
has	17
caught	17
on	17
one	17
of	17
the	17
bars	17
of	17
the	17
balcony	17
and	17
she	17
is	17
left	17
hanging	17
in	17
the	17
air,	17
unable	17
to	17
reach	17
the	17
ground.	17
But	17
you	17
see	17
how	17
compassionate	17
heaven	17
sends	17
aid	17
in	17
our	17
sorest	17
need;	17
Don	17
Gaiferos	17
advances,	17
and	17
without	17
minding	17
whether	17
the	17
rich	17
petticoat	17
is	17
torn	17
or	17
not,	17
he	17
seizes	17
her	17
and	17
by	17
force	17
brings	17
her	17
to	17
the	17
ground,	17
and	17
then	17
with	17
one	17
jerk	17
places	17
her	17
on	17
the	17
haunches	17
of	17
his	17
horse,	17
astraddle	17
like	17
a	17
man,	17
and	17
bids	17
her	17
hold	17
on	17
tight	17
and	17
clasp	17
her	17
arms	17
round	17
his	17
neck,	17
crossing	17
them	17
on	17
his	17
breast	17
so	17
as	17
not	17
to	17
fall,	17
for	17
the	17
lady	17
Melisendra	17
was	17
not	17
used	17
to	17
that	17
style	17
of	17
riding.	17
You	17
see,	17
too,	17
how	17
the	17
neighing	17
of	17
the	17
horse	17
shows	17
his	17
satisfaction	17
with	17
the	17
gallant	17
and	17
beautiful	17
burden	17
he	17
bears	17
in	17
his	17
lord	17
and	17
lady.	17
You	17
see	17
how	17
they	17
wheel	17
round	17
and	17
quit	17
the	17
city,	17
and	17
in	17
joy	17
and	17
gladness	17
take	17
the	17
road	17
to	17
Paris.	17
Go	17
in	17
peace,	17
O	17
peerless	17
pair	17
of	17
true	17
lovers!	17
May	17
you	17
reach	17
your	17
longed-for	17
fatherland	17
in	17
safety,	17
and	17
may	17
fortune	17
interpose	17
no	17
impediment	17
to	17
your	17
prosperous	17
journey;	17
may	17
the	17
eyes	17
of	17
your	17
friends	17
and	17
kinsmen	17
behold	17
you	17
enjoying	17
in	17
peace	17
and	17
tranquillity	17
the	17
remaining	17
days	17
of	17
your	17
life—and	17
that	17
they	17
may	17
be	17
as	17
many	17
as	17
those	17
of	17
Nestor!”	17
Here	17
Master	17
Pedro	17
called	17
out	17
again	17
and	17
said,	17
“Simplicity,	17
boy!	17
None	17
of	17
your	17
high	17
flights;	17
all	17
affectation	17
is	17
bad.”	17
The	17
interpreter	17
made	17
no	17
answer,	17
but	17
went	17
on	17
to	17
say,	17
“There	17
was	17
no	17
want	17
of	17
idle	17
eyes,	17
that	17
see	17
everything,	17
to	17
see	17
Melisendra	17
come	17
down	17
and	17
mount,	17
and	17
word	17
was	17
brought	17
to	17
King	17
Marsilio,	17
who	17
at	17
once	17
gave	17
orders	17
to	17
sound	17
the	17
alarm;	17
and	17
see	17
what	17
a	17
stir	17
there	17
is,	17
and	17
how	17
the	17
city	17
is	17
drowned	17
with	17
the	17
sound	17
of	17
the	17
bells	17
pealing	17
in	17
the	17
towers	17
of	17
all	17
the	17
mosques.”	17
“Nay,	17
nay,”	17
said	17
Don	17
Quixote	17
at	17
this;	17
“on	17
that	17
point	17
of	17
the	17
bells	17
Master	17
Pedro	17
is	17
very	17
inaccurate,	17
for	17
bells	17
are	17
not	17
in	17
use	17
among	17
the	17
Moors;	17
only	17
kettledrums,	17
and	17
a	17
kind	17
of	17
small	17
trumpet	17
somewhat	17
like	17
our	17
clarion;	17
to	17
ring	17
bells	17
this	17
way	17
in	17
Sansueña	17
is	17
unquestionably	17
a	17
great	17
absurdity.”	17
On	17
hearing	17
this,	17
Master	17
Pedro	17
stopped	17
ringing,	17
and	17
said,	17
“Don’t	17
look	17
into	17
trifles,	17
Señor	17
Don	17
Quixote,	17
or	17
want	17
to	17
have	17
things	17
up	17
to	17
a	17
pitch	17
of	17
perfection	17
that	17
is	17
out	17
of	17
reach.	17
Are	17
there	17
not	17
almost	17
every	17
day	17
a	17
thousand	17
comedies	17
represented	17
all	17
round	17
us	17
full	17
of	17
thousands	17
of	17
inaccuracies	17
and	17
absurdities,	17
and,	17
for	17
all	17
that,	17
they	17
have	17
a	17
successful	17
run,	17
and	17
are	17
listened	17
to	17
not	17
only	17
with	17
applause,	17
but	17
with	17
admiration	17
and	17
all	17
the	17
rest	17
of	17
it?	17
Go	17
on,	17
boy,	17
and	17
don’t	17
mind;	17
for	17
so	17
long	17
as	17
I	17
fill	17
my	17
pouch,	17
no	17
matter	17
if	17
I	17
show	17
as	17
many	17
inaccuracies	17
as	17
there	17
are	17
motes	17
in	17
a	17
sunbeam.”	17
“True	17
enough,”	17
said	17
Don	17
Quixote;	17
and	17
the	17
boy	17
went	17
on:	17
“See	17
what	17
a	17
numerous	17
and	17
glittering	17
crowd	17
of	17
horsemen	17
issues	17
from	17
the	17
city	17
in	17
pursuit	17
of	17
the	17
two	17
faithful	17
lovers,	17
what	17
a	17
blowing	17
of	17
trumpets	17
there	17
is,	17
what	17
sounding	17
of	17
horns,	17
what	17
beating	17
of	17
drums	17
and	17
tabors;	17
I	17
fear	17
me	17
they	17
will	17
overtake	17
them	17
and	17
bring	17
them	17
back	17
tied	17
to	17
the	17
tail	17
of	17
their	17
own	17
horse,	17
which	17
would	17
be	17
a	17
dreadful	17
sight.”	17

Don	17
Quixote,	17
however,	17
seeing	17
such	17
a	17
swarm	17
of	17
Moors	17
and	17
hearing	17
such	17
a	17
din,	17
thought	17
it	17
would	17
be	17
right	17
to	17
aid	17
the	17
fugitives,	17
and	17
standing	17
up	17
he	17
exclaimed	17
in	17
a	17
loud	17
voice,	17
“Never,	17
while	17
I	17
live,	17
will	17
I	17
permit	17
foul	17
play	17
to	17
be	17
practised	17
in	17
my	17
presence	17
on	17
such	17
a	17
famous	17
knight	17
and	17
fearless	17
lover	17
as	17
Don	17
Gaiferos.	17
Halt!	17
ill-born	17
rabble,	17
follow	17
him	17
not	17
nor	17
pursue	17
him,	17
or	17
ye	17
will	17
have	17
to	17
reckon	17
with	17
me	17
in	17
battle!”	17
and	17
suiting	17
the	17
action	17
to	17
the	17
word,	17
he	17
drew	17
his	17
sword,	17
and	17
with	17
one	17
bound	17
placed	17
himself	17
close	17
to	17
the	17
show,	17
and	17
with	17
unexampled	17
rapidity	17
and	17
fury	17
began	17
to	17
shower	17
down	17
blows	17
on	17
the	17
puppet	17
troop	17
of	17
Moors,	17
knocking	17
over	17
some,	17
decapitating	17
others,	17
maiming	17
this	17
one	17
and	17
demolishing	17
that;	17
and	17
among	17
many	17
more	17
he	17
delivered	17
one	17
down	17
stroke	17
which,	17
if	17
Master	17
Pedro	17
had	17
not	17
ducked,	17
made	17
himself	17
small,	17
and	17
got	17
out	17
of	17
the	17
way,	17
would	17
have	17
sliced	17
off	17
his	17
head	17
as	17
easily	17
as	17
if	17
it	17
had	17
been	17
made	17
of	17
almond-paste.	17
Master	17
Pedro	17
kept	17
shouting,	17
“Hold	17
hard!	17
Señor	17
Don	17
Quixote!	17
can’t	17
you	17
see	17
they’re	17
not	17
real	17
Moors	17
you’re	17
knocking	17
down	17
and	17
killing	17
and	17
destroying,	17
but	17
only	17
little	17
pasteboard	17
figures!	17
Look—sinner	17
that	17
I	17
am!—how	17
you’re	17
wrecking	17
and	17
ruining	17
all	17
that	17
I’m	17
worth!”	17
But	17
in	17
spite	17
of	17
this,	17
Don	17
Quixote	17
did	17
not	17
leave	17
off	17
discharging	17
a	17
continuous	17
rain	17
of	17
cuts,	17
slashes,	17
downstrokes,	17
and	17
backstrokes,	17
and	17
at	17
length,	17
in	17
less	17
than	17
the	17
space	17
of	17
two	17
credos,	17
he	17
brought	17
the	17
whole	17
show	17
to	17
the	17
ground,	17
with	17
all	17
its	17
fittings	17
and	17
figures	17
shivered	17
and	17
knocked	17
to	17
pieces,	17
King	17
Marsilio	17
badly	17
wounded,	17
and	17
the	17
Emperor	17
Charlemagne	17
with	17
his	17
crown	17
and	17
head	17
split	17
in	17
two.	17
The	17
whole	17
audience	17
was	17
thrown	17
into	17
confusion,	17
the	17
ape	17
fled	17
to	17
the	17
roof	17
of	17
the	17
inn,	17
the	17
cousin	17
was	17
frightened,	17
and	17
even	17
Sancho	17
Panza	17
himself	17
was	17
in	17
mighty	17
fear,	17
for,	17
as	17
he	17
swore	17
after	17
the	17
storm	17
was	17
over,	17
he	17
had	17
never	17
seen	17
his	17
master	17
in	17
such	17
a	17
furious	17
passion.	17
The	17
complete	17
destruction	17
of	17
the	17
show	17
being	17
thus	17
accomplished,	17
Don	17
Quixote	17
became	17
a	17
little	17
calmer,	17
said,	17
“I	17
wish	17
I	17
had	17
here	17
before	17
me	17
now	17
all	17
those	17
who	17
do	17
not	17
or	17
will	17
not	17
believe	17
how	17
useful	17
knights-errant	17
are	17
in	17
the	17
world;	17
just	17
think,	17
if	17
I	17
had	17
not	17
been	17
here	17
present,	17
what	17
would	17
have	17
become	17
of	17
the	17
brave	17
Don	17
Gaiferos	17
and	17
the	17
fair	17
Melisendra!	17
Depend	17
upon	17
it,	17
by	17
this	17
time	17
those	17
dogs	17
would	17
have	17
overtaken	17
them	17
and	17
inflicted	17
some	17
outrage	17
upon	17
them.	17
So,	17
then,	17
long	17
live	17
knight-errantry	17
beyond	17
everything	17
living	17
on	17
earth	17
this	17
day!”	17
“Let	17
it	17
live,	17
and	17
welcome,”	17
said	17
Master	17
Pedro	17
at	17
this	17
in	17
a	17
feeble	17
voice,	17
“and	17
let	17
me	17
die,	17
for	17
I	17
am	17
so	17
unfortunate	17
that	17
I	17
can	17
say	17
with	17
King	17
Don	17
Rodrigo—	17
Yesterday	17
was	17
I	17
lord	17
of	17
Spain	17
To-day	17
I’ve	17
not	17
a	17
turret	17
left	17
That	17
I	17
may	17
call	17
mine	17
own.	17
Not	17
half	17
an	17
hour,	17
nay,	17
barely	17
a	17
minute	17
ago,	17
I	17
saw	17
myself	17
lord	17
of	17
kings	17
and	17
emperors,	17
with	17
my	17
stables	17
filled	17
with	17
countless	17
horses,	17
and	17
my	17
trunks	17
and	17
bags	17
with	17
gay	17
dresses	17
unnumbered;	17
and	17
now	17
I	17
find	17
myself	17
ruined	17
and	17
laid	17
low,	17
destitute	17
and	17
a	17
beggar,	17
and	17
above	17
all	17
without	17
my	17
ape,	17
for,	17
by	17
my	17
faith,	17
my	17
teeth	17
will	17
have	17
to	17
sweat	17
for	17
it	17
before	17
I	17
have	17
him	17
caught;	17
and	17
all	17
through	17
the	17
reckless	17
fury	17
of	17
sir	17
knight	17
here,	17
who,	17
they	17
say,	17
protects	17
the	17
fatherless,	17
and	17
rights	17
wrongs,	17
and	17
does	17
other	17
charitable	17
deeds;	17
but	17
whose	17
generous	17
intentions	17
have	17
been	17
found	17
wanting	17
in	17
my	17
case	17
only,	17
blessed	17
and	17
praised	17
be	17
the	17
highest	17
heavens!	17
Verily,	17
knight	17
of	17
the	17
rueful	17
figure	17
he	17
must	17
be	17
to	17
have	17
disfigured	17
mine.”	17
Sancho	17
Panza	17
was	17
touched	17
by	17
Master	17
Pedro’s	17
words,	17
and	17
said	17
to	17
him,	17
“Don’t	17
weep	17
and	17
lament,	17
Master	17
Pedro;	17
you	17
break	17
my	17
heart;	17
let	17
me	17
tell	17
you	17
my	17
master,	17
Don	17
Quixote,	17
is	17
so	17
catholic	17
and	17
scrupulous	17
a	17
Christian	17
that,	17
if	17
he	17
can	17
make	17
out	17
that	17
he	17
has	17
done	17
you	17
any	17
wrong,	17
he	17
will	17
own	17
it,	17
and	17
be	17
willing	17
to	17
pay	17
for	17
it	17
and	17
make	17
it	17
good,	17
and	17
something	17
over	17
and	17
above.”	17
“Only	17
let	17
Señor	17
Don	17
Quixote	17
pay	17
me	17
for	17
some	17
part	17
of	17
the	17
work	17
he	17
has	17
destroyed,”	17
said	17
Master	17
Pedro,	17
“and	17
I	17
would	17
be	17
content,	17
and	17
his	17
worship	17
would	17
ease	17
his	17
conscience,	17
for	17
he	17
cannot	17
be	17
saved	17
who	17
keeps	17
what	17
is	17
another’s	17
against	17
the	17
owner’s	17
will,	17
and	17
makes	17
no	17
restitution.”	17
“That	17
is	17
true,”	17
said	17
Don	17
Quixote;	17
“but	17
at	17
present	17
I	17
am	17
not	17
aware	17
that	17
I	17
have	17
got	17
anything	17
of	17
yours,	17
Master	17
Pedro.”	17
“What!”	17
returned	17
Master	17
Pedro;	17
“and	17
these	17
relics	17
lying	17
here	17
on	17
the	17
bare	17
hard	17
ground—what	17
scattered	17
and	17
shattered	17
them	17
but	17
the	17
invincible	17
strength	17
of	17
that	17
mighty	17
arm?	17
And	17
whose	17
were	17
the	17
bodies	17
they	17
belonged	17
to	17
but	17
mine?	17
And	17
what	17
did	17
I	17
get	17
my	17
living	17
by	17
but	17
by	17
them?”	17
“Now	17
am	17
I	17
fully	17
convinced,”	17
said	17
Don	17
Quixote,	17
“of	17
what	17
I	17
had	17
many	17
a	17
time	17
before	17
believed;	17
that	17
the	17
enchanters	17
who	17
persecute	17
me	17
do	17
nothing	17
more	17
than	17
put	17
figures	17
like	17
these	17
before	17
my	17
eyes,	17
and	17
then	17
change	17
and	17
turn	17
them	17
into	17
what	17
they	17
please.	17
In	17
truth	17
and	17
earnest,	17
I	17
assure	17
you	17
gentlemen	17
who	17
now	17
hear	17
me,	17
that	17
to	17
me	17
everything	17
that	17
has	17
taken	17
place	17
here	17
seemed	17
to	17
take	17
place	17
literally,	17
that	17
Melisendra	17
was	17
Melisendra,	17
Don	17
Gaiferos	17
Don	17
Gaiferos,	17
Marsilio	17
Marsilio,	17
and	17
Charlemagne	17
Charlemagne.	17
That	17
was	17
why	17
my	17
anger	17
was	17
roused;	17
and	17
to	17
be	17
faithful	17
to	17
my	17
calling	17
as	17
a	17
knight-errant	17
I	17
sought	17
to	17
give	17
aid	17
and	17
protection	17
to	17
those	17
who	17
fled,	17
and	17
with	17
this	17
good	17
intention	17
I	17
did	17
what	17
you	17
have	17
seen.	17
If	17
the	17
result	17
has	17
been	17
the	17
opposite	17
of	17
what	17
I	17
intended,	17
it	17
is	17
no	17
fault	17
of	17
mine,	17
but	17
of	17
those	17
wicked	17
beings	17
that	17
persecute	17
me;	17
but,	17
for	17
all	17
that,	17
I	17
am	17
willing	17
to	17
condemn	17
myself	17
in	17
costs	17
for	17
this	17
error	17
of	17
mine,	17
though	17
it	17
did	17
not	17
proceed	17
from	17
malice;	17
let	17
Master	17
Pedro	17
see	17
what	17
he	17
wants	17
for	17
the	17
spoiled	17
figures,	17
for	17
I	17
agree	17
to	17
pay	17
it	17
at	17
once	17
in	17
good	17
and	17
current	17
money	17
of	17
Castile.”	17
Master	17
Pedro	17
made	17
him	17
a	17
bow,	17
saying,	17
“I	17
expected	17
no	17
less	17
of	17
the	17
rare	17
Christianity	17
of	17
the	17
valiant	17
Don	17
Quixote	17
of	17
La	17
Mancha,	17
true	17
helper	17
and	17
protector	17
of	17
all	17
destitute	17
and	17
needy	17
vagabonds;	17
master	17
landlord	17
here	17
and	17
the	17
great	17
Sancho	17
Panza	17
shall	17
be	17
the	17
arbitrators	17
and	17
appraisers	17
between	17
your	17
worship	17
and	17
me	17
of	17
what	17
these	17
dilapidated	17
figures	17
are	17
worth	17
or	17
may	17
be	17
worth.”	17
The	17
landlord	17
and	17
Sancho	17
consented,	17
and	17
then	17
Master	17
Pedro	17
picked	17
up	17
from	17
the	17
ground	17
King	17
Marsilio	17
of	17
Saragossa	17
with	17
his	17
head	17
off,	17
and	17
said,	17
“Here	17
you	17
see	17
how	17
impossible	17
it	17
is	17
to	17
restore	17
this	17
king	17
to	17
his	17
former	17
state,	17
so	17
I	17
think,	17
saving	17
your	17
better	17
judgments,	17
that	17
for	17
his	17
death,	17
decease,	17
and	17
demise,	17
four	17
reals	17
and	17
a	17
half	17
may	17
be	17
given	17
me.”	17
“Proceed,”	17
said	17
Don	17
Quixote.	17
“Well	17
then,	17
for	17
this	17
cleavage	17
from	17
top	17
to	17
bottom,”	17
continued	17
Master	17
Pedro,	17
taking	17
up	17
the	17
split	17
Emperor	17
Charlemagne,	17
“it	17
would	17
not	17
be	17
much	17
if	17
I	17
were	17
to	17
ask	17
five	17
reals	17
and	17
a	17
quarter.”	17
“It’s	17
not	17
little,”	17
said	17
Sancho.	17
“Nor	17
is	17
it	17
much,”	17
said	17
the	17
landlord;	17
“make	17
it	17
even,	17
and	17
say	17
five	17
reals.”	17
“Let	17
him	17
have	17
the	17
whole	17
five	17
and	17
a	17
quarter,”	17
said	17
Don	17
Quixote;	17
“for	17
the	17
sum	17
total	17
of	17
this	17
notable	17
disaster	17
does	17
not	17
stand	17
on	17
a	17
quarter	17
more	17
or	17
less;	17
and	17
make	17
an	17
end	17
of	17
it	17
quickly,	17
Master	17
Pedro,	17
for	17
it’s	17
getting	17
on	17
to	17
supper-time,	17
and	17
I	17
have	17
some	17
hints	17
of	17
hunger.”	17
“For	17
this	17
figure,”	17
said	17
Master	17
Pedro,	17
“that	17
is	17
without	17
a	17
nose,	17
and	17
wants	17
an	17
eye,	17
and	17
is	17
the	17
fair	17
Melisendra,	17
I	17
ask,	17
and	17
I	17
am	17
reasonable	17
in	17
my	17
charge,	17
two	17
reals	17
and	17
twelve	17
maravedis.”	17
“The	17
very	17
devil	17
must	17
be	17
in	17
it,”	17
said	17
Don	17
Quixote,	17
“if	17
Melisendra	17
and	17
her	17
husband	17
are	17
not	17
by	17
this	17
time	17
at	17
least	17
on	17
the	17
French	17
border,	17
for	17
the	17
horse	17
they	17
rode	17
on	17
seemed	17
to	17
me	17
to	17
fly	17
rather	17
than	17
gallop;	17
so	17
you	17
needn’t	17
try	17
to	17
sell	17
me	17
the	17
cat	17
for	17
the	17
hare,	17
showing	17
me	17
here	17
a	17
noseless	17
Melisendra	17
when	17
she	17
is	17
now,	17
may	17
be,	17
enjoying	17
herself	17
at	17
her	17
ease	17
with	17
her	17
husband	17
in	17
France.	17
God	17
help	17
every	17
one	17
to	17
his	17
own,	17
Master	17
Pedro,	17
and	17
let	17
us	17
all	17
proceed	17
fairly	17
and	17
honestly;	17
and	17
now	17
go	17
on.”	17
Master	17
Pedro,	17
perceiving	17
that	17
Don	17
Quixote	17
was	17
beginning	17
to	17
wander,	17
and	17
return	17
to	17
his	17
original	17
fancy,	17
was	17
not	17
disposed	17
to	17
let	17
him	17
escape,	17
so	17
he	17
said	17
to	17
him,	17
“This	17
cannot	17
be	17
Melisendra,	17
but	17
must	17
be	17
one	17
of	17
the	17
damsels	17
that	17
waited	17
on	17
her;	17
so	17
if	17
I’m	17
given	17
sixty	17
maravedis	17
for	17
her,	17
I’ll	17
be	17
content	17
and	17
sufficiently	17
paid.”	17
And	17
so	17
he	17
went	17
on,	17
putting	17
values	17
on	17
ever	17
so	17
many	17
more	17
smashed	17
figures,	17
which,	17
after	17
the	17
two	17
arbitrators	17
had	17
adjusted	17
them	17
to	17
the	17
satisfaction	17
of	17
both	17
parties,	17
came	17
to	17
forty	17
reals	17
and	17
three-quarters;	17
and	17
over	17
and	17
above	17
this	17
sum,	17
which	17
Sancho	17
at	17
once	17
disbursed,	17
Master	17
Pedro	17
asked	17
for	17
two	17
reals	17
for	17
his	17
trouble	17
in	17
catching	17
the	17
ape.	17
“Let	17
him	17
have	17
them,	17
Sancho,”	17
said	17
Don	17
Quixote;	17
“not	17
to	17
catch	17
the	17
ape,	17
but	17
to	17
get	17
drunk;	17
and	17
two	17
hundred	17
would	17
I	17
give	17
this	17
minute	17
for	17
the	17
good	17
news,	17
to	17
anyone	17
who	17
could	17
tell	17
me	17
positively,	17
that	17
the	17
lady	17
Doña	17
Melisandra	17
and	17
Señor	17
Don	17
Gaiferos	17
were	17
now	17
in	17
France	17
and	17
with	17
their	17
own	17
people.”	17
“No	17
one	17
could	17
tell	17
us	17
that	17
better	17
than	17
my	17
ape,”	17
said	17
Master	17
Pedro;	17
“but	17
there’s	17
no	17
devil	17
that	17
could	17
catch	17
him	17
now;	17
I	17
suspect,	17
however,	17
that	17
affection	17
and	17
hunger	17
will	17
drive	17
him	17
to	17
come	17
looking	17
for	17
me	17
to-night;	17
but	17
to-morrow	17
will	17
soon	17
be	17
here	17
and	17
we	17
shall	17
see.”	17
In	17
short,	17
the	17
puppet-show	17
storm	17
passed	17
off,	17
and	17
all	17
supped	17
in	17
peace	17
and	17
good	17
fellowship	17
at	17
Don	17
Quixote’s	17
expense,	17
for	17
he	17
was	17
the	17
height	17
of	17
generosity.	17
Before	17
it	17
was	17
daylight	17
the	17
man	17
with	17
the	17
lances	17
and	17
halberds	17
took	17
his	17
departure,	17
and	17
soon	17
after	17
daybreak	17
the	17
cousin	17
and	17
the	17
page	17
came	17
to	17
bid	17
Don	17
Quixote	17
farewell,	17
the	17
former	17
returning	17
home,	17
the	17
latter	17
resuming	17
his	17
journey,	17
towards	17
which,	17
to	17
help	17
him,	17
Don	17
Quixote	17
gave	17
him	17
twelve	17
reals.	17
Master	17
Pedro	17
did	17
not	17
care	17
to	17
engage	17
in	17
any	17
more	17
palaver	17
with	17
Don	17
Quixote,	17
whom	17
he	17
knew	17
right	17
well;	17
so	17
he	17
rose	17
before	17
the	17
sun,	17
and	17
having	17
got	17
together	17
the	17
remains	17
of	17
his	17
show	17
and	17
caught	17
his	17
ape,	17
he	17
too	17
went	17
off	17
to	17
seek	17
his	17
adventures.	17
The	17
landlord,	17
who	17
did	17
not	17
know	17
Don	17
Quixote,	17
was	17
as	17
much	17
astonished	17
at	17
his	17
mad	17
freaks	17
as	17
at	17
his	17
generosity.	17
To	17
conclude,	17
Sancho,	17
by	17
his	17
master’s	17
orders,	17
paid	17
him	17
very	17
liberally,	17
and	17
taking	17
leave	17
of	17
him	17
they	17
quitted	17
the	17
inn	17
at	17
about	17
eight	17
in	17
the	17
morning	17
and	17
took	17
to	17
the	17
road,	17
where	17
we	17
will	17
leave	17
them	17
to	17
pursue	17
their	17
journey,	17
for	17
this	17
is	17
necessary	17
in	17
order	17
to	17
allow	17
certain	17
other	17
matters	17
to	17
be	17
set	17
forth,	17
which	17
are	17
required	17
to	17
clear	17
up	17
this	17
famous	17
history.	17

Cide	17
Hamete,	17
the	17
chronicler	17
of	17
this	17
great	17
history,	17
begins	17
this	17
chapter	17
with	17
these	17
words,	17
“I	17
swear	17
as	17
a	17
Catholic	17
Christian;”	17
with	17
regard	17
to	17
which	17
his	17
translator	17
says	17
that	17
Cide	17
Hamete’s	17
swearing	17
as	17
a	17
Catholic	17
Christian,	17
he	17
being—as	17
no	17
doubt	17
he	17
was—a	17
Moor,	17
only	17
meant	17
that,	17
just	17
as	17
a	17
Catholic	17
Christian	17
taking	17
an	17
oath	17
swears,	17
or	17
ought	17
to	17
swear,	17
what	17
is	17
true,	17
and	17
tell	17
the	17
truth	17
in	17
what	17
he	17
avers,	17
so	17
he	17
was	17
telling	17
the	17
truth,	17
as	17
much	17
as	17
if	17
he	17
swore	17
as	17
a	17
Catholic	17
Christian,	17
in	17
all	17
he	17
chose	17
to	17
write	17
about	17
Quixote,	17
especially	17
in	17
declaring	17
who	17
Master	17
Pedro	17
was	17
and	17
what	17
was	17
the	17
divining	17
ape	17
that	17
astonished	17
all	17
the	17
villages	17
with	17
his	17
divinations.	17
He	17
says,	17
then,	17
that	17
he	17
who	17
has	17
read	17
the	17
First	17
Part	17
of	17
this	17
history	17
will	17
remember	17
well	17
enough	17
the	17
Gines	17
de	17
Pasamonte	17
whom,	17
with	17
other	17
galley	17
slaves,	17
Don	17
Quixote	17
set	17
free	17
in	17
the	17
Sierra	17
Morena:	17
a	17
kindness	17
for	17
which	17
he	17
afterwards	17
got	17
poor	17
thanks	17
and	17
worse	17
payment	17
from	17
that	17
evil-minded,	17
ill-conditioned	17
set.	17
This	17
Gines	17
de	17
Pasamonte—Don	17
Ginesillo	17
de	17
Parapilla,	17
Don	17
Quixote	17
called	17
him—it	17
was	17
that	17
stole	17
Dapple	17
from	17
Sancho	17
Panza;	17
which,	17
because	17
by	17
the	17
fault	17
of	17
the	17
printers	17
neither	17
the	17
how	17
nor	17
the	17
when	17
was	17
stated	17
in	17
the	17
First	17
Part,	17
has	17
been	17
a	17
puzzle	17
to	17
a	17
good	17
many	17
people,	17
who	17
attribute	17
to	17
the	17
bad	17
memory	17
of	17
the	17
author	17
what	17
was	17
the	17
error	17
of	17
the	17
press.	17
In	17
fact,	17
however,	17
Gines	17
stole	17
him	17
while	17
Sancho	17
Panza	17
was	17
asleep	17
on	17
his	17
back,	17
adopting	17
the	17
plan	17
and	17
device	17
that	17
Brunello	17
had	17
recourse	17
to	17
when	17
he	17
stole	17
Sacripante’s	17
horse	17
from	17
between	17
his	17
legs	17
at	17
the	17
siege	17
of	17
Albracca;	17
and,	17
as	17
has	17
been	17
told,	17
Sancho	17
afterwards	17
recovered	17
him.	17
This	17
Gines,	17
then,	17
afraid	17
of	17
being	17
caught	17
by	17
the	17
officers	17
of	17
justice,	17
who	17
were	17
looking	17
for	17
him	17
to	17
punish	17
him	17
for	17
his	17
numberless	17
rascalities	17
and	17
offences	17
(which	17
were	17
so	17
many	17
and	17
so	17
great	17
that	17
he	17
himself	17
wrote	17
a	17
big	17
book	17
giving	17
an	17
account	17
of	17
them),	17
resolved	17
to	17
shift	17
his	17
quarters	17
into	17
the	17
kingdom	17
of	17
Aragon,	17
and	17
cover	17
up	17
his	17
left	17
eye,	17
and	17
take	17
up	17
the	17
trade	17
of	17
a	17
puppet-showman;	17
for	17
this,	17
as	17
well	17
as	17
juggling,	17
he	17
knew	17
how	17
to	17
practise	17
to	17
perfection.	17
From	17
some	17
released	17
Christians	17
returning	17
from	17
Barbary,	17
it	17
so	17
happened,	17
he	17
bought	17
the	17
ape,	17
which	17
he	17
taught	17
to	17
mount	17
upon	17
his	17
shoulder	17
on	17
his	17
making	17
a	17
certain	17
sign,	17
and	17
to	17
whisper,	17
or	17
seem	17
to	17
do	17
so,	17
in	17
his	17
ear.	17
Thus	17
prepared,	17
before	17
entering	17
any	17
village	17
whither	17
he	17
was	17
bound	17
with	17
his	17
show	17
and	17
his	17
ape,	17
he	17
used	17
to	17
inform	17
himself	17
at	17
the	17
nearest	17
village,	17
or	17
from	17
the	17
most	17
likely	17
person	17
he	17
could	17
find,	17
as	17
to	17
what	17
particular	17
things	17
had	17
happened	17
there,	17
and	17
to	17
whom;	17
and	17
bearing	17
them	17
well	17
in	17
mind,	17
the	17
first	17
thing	17
he	17
did	17
was	17
to	17
exhibit	17
his	17
show,	17
sometimes	17
one	17
story,	17
sometimes	17
another,	17
but	17
all	17
lively,	17
amusing,	17
and	17
familiar.	17
As	17
soon	17
as	17
the	17
exhibition	17
was	17
over	17
he	17
brought	17
forward	17
the	17
accomplishments	17
of	17
his	17
ape,	17
assuring	17
the	17
public	17
that	17
he	17
divined	17
all	17
the	17
past	17
and	17
the	17
present,	17
but	17
as	17
to	17
the	17
future	17
he	17
had	17
no	17
skill.	17
For	17
each	17
question	17
answered	17
he	17
asked	17
two	17
reals,	17
and	17
for	17
some	17
he	17
made	17
a	17
reduction,	17
just	17
as	17
he	17
happened	17
to	17
feel	17
the	17
pulse	17
of	17
the	17
questioners;	17
and	17
when	17
now	17
and	17
then	17
he	17
came	17
to	17
houses	17
where	17
things	17
that	17
he	17
knew	17
of	17
had	17
happened	17
to	17
the	17
people	17
living	17
there,	17
even	17
if	17
they	17
did	17
not	17
ask	17
him	17
a	17
question,	17
not	17
caring	17
to	17
pay	17
for	17
it,	17
he	17
would	17
make	17
the	17
sign	17
to	17
the	17
ape	17
and	17
then	17
declare	17
that	17
it	17
had	17
said	17
so	17
and	17
so,	17
which	17
fitted	17
the	17
case	17
exactly.	17
In	17
this	17
way	17
he	17
acquired	17
a	17
prodigious	17
name	17
and	17
all	17
ran	17
after	17
him;	17
on	17
other	17
occasions,	17
being	17
very	17
crafty,	17
he	17
would	17
answer	17
in	17
such	17
a	17
way	17
that	17
the	17
answers	17
suited	17
the	17
questions;	17
and	17
as	17
no	17
one	17
cross-questioned	17
him	17
or	17
pressed	17
him	17
to	17
tell	17
how	17
his	17
ape	17
divined,	17
he	17
made	17
fools	17
of	17
them	17
all	17
and	17
filled	17
his	17
pouch.	17
The	17
instant	17
he	17
entered	17
the	17
inn	17
he	17
knew	17
Don	17
Quixote	17
and	17
Sancho,	17
and	17
with	17
that	17
knowledge	17
it	17
was	17
easy	17
for	17
him	17
to	17
astonish	17
them	17
and	17
all	17
who	17
were	17
there;	17
but	17
it	17
would	17
have	17
cost	17
him	17
dear	17
had	17
Don	17
Quixote	17
brought	17
down	17
his	17
hand	17
a	17
little	17
lower	17
when	17
he	17
cut	17
off	17
King	17
Marsilio’s	17
head	17
and	17
destroyed	17
all	17
his	17
horsemen,	17
as	17
related	17
in	17
the	17
preceeding	17
chapter.	17
So	17
much	17
for	17
Master	17
Pedro	17
and	17
his	17
ape;	17
and	17
now	17
to	17
return	17
to	17
Don	17
Quixote	17
of	17
La	17
Mancha.	17
After	17
he	17
had	17
left	17
the	17
inn	17
he	17
determined	17
to	17
visit,	17
first	17
of	17
all,	17
the	17
banks	17
of	17
the	17
Ebro	17
and	17
that	17
neighbourhood,	17
before	17
entering	17
the	17
city	17
of	17
Saragossa,	17
for	17
the	17
ample	17
time	17
there	17
was	17
still	17
to	17
spare	17
before	17
the	17
jousts	17
left	17
him	17
enough	17
for	17
all.	17
With	17
this	17
object	17
in	17
view	17
he	17
followed	17
the	17
road	17
and	17
travelled	17
along	17
it	17
for	17
two	17
days,	17
without	17
meeting	17
any	17
adventure	17
worth	17
committing	17
to	17
writing	17
until	17
on	17
the	17
third	17
day,	17
as	17
he	17
was	17
ascending	17
a	17
hill,	17
he	17
heard	17
a	17
great	17
noise	17
of	17
drums,	17
trumpets,	17
and	17
musket-shots.	17
At	17
first	17
he	17
imagined	17
some	17
regiment	17
of	17
soldiers	17
was	17
passing	17
that	17
way,	17
and	17
to	17
see	17
them	17
he	17
spurred	17
Rocinante	17
and	17
mounted	17
the	17
hill.	17
On	17
reaching	17
the	17
top	17
he	17
saw	17
at	17
the	17
foot	17
of	17
it	17
over	17
two	17
hundred	17
men,	17
as	17
it	17
seemed	17
to	17
him,	17
armed	17
with	17
weapons	17
of	17
various	17
sorts,	17
lances,	17
crossbows,	17
partisans,	17
halberds,	17
and	17
pikes,	17
and	17
a	17
few	17
muskets	17
and	17
a	17
great	17
many	17
bucklers.	17
He	17
descended	17
the	17
slope	17
and	17
approached	17
the	17
band	17
near	17
enough	17
to	17
see	17
distinctly	17
the	17
flags,	17
make	17
out	17
the	17
colours	17
and	17
distinguish	17
the	17
devices	17
they	17
bore,	17
especially	17
one	17
on	17
a	17
standard	17
or	17
ensign	17
of	17
white	17
satin,	17
on	17
which	17
there	17
was	17
painted	17
in	17
a	17
very	17
life-like	17
style	17
an	17
ass	17
like	17
a	17
little	17
sard,	17
with	17
its	17
head	17
up,	17
its	17
mouth	17
open	17
and	17
its	17
tongue	17
out,	17
as	17
if	17
it	17
were	17
in	17
the	17
act	17
and	17
attitude	17
of	17
braying;	17
and	17
round	17
it	17
were	17
inscribed	17
in	17
large	17
characters	17
these	17
two	17
lines—	17
They	17
did	17
not	17
bray	17
in	17
vain,	17
Our	17
alcaldes	17
twain.	17
From	17
this	17
device	17
Don	17
Quixote	17
concluded	17
that	17
these	17
people	17
must	17
be	17
from	17
the	17
braying	17
town,	17
and	17
he	17
said	17
so	17
to	17
Sancho,	17
explaining	17
to	17
him	17
what	17
was	17
written	17
on	17
the	17
standard.	17
At	17
the	17
same	17
time	17
be	17
observed	17
that	17
the	17
man	17
who	17
had	17
told	17
them	17
about	17
the	17
matter	17
was	17
wrong	17
in	17
saying	17
that	17
the	17
two	17
who	17
brayed	17
were	17
regidors,	17
for	17
according	17
to	17
the	17
lines	17
of	17
the	17
standard	17
they	17
were	17
alcaldes.	17
To	17
which	17
Sancho	17
replied,	17
“Señor,	17
there’s	17
nothing	17
to	17
stick	17
at	17
in	17
that,	17
for	17
maybe	17
the	17
regidors	17
who	17
brayed	17
then	17
came	17
to	17
be	17
alcaldes	17
of	17
their	17
town	17
afterwards,	17
and	17
so	17
they	17
may	17
go	17
by	17
both	17
titles;	17
moreover,	17
it	17
has	17
nothing	17
to	17
do	17
with	17
the	17
truth	17
of	17
the	17
story	17
whether	17
the	17
brayers	17
were	17
alcaldes	17
or	17
regidors,	17
provided	17
at	17
any	17
rate	17
they	17
did	17
bray;	17
for	17
an	17
alcalde	17
is	17
just	17
as	17
likely	17
to	17
bray	17
as	17
a	17
regidor.”	17
They	17
perceived,	17
in	17
short,	17
clearly	17
that	17
the	17
town	17
which	17
had	17
been	17
twitted	17
had	17
turned	17
out	17
to	17
do	17
battle	17
with	17
some	17
other	17
that	17
had	17
jeered	17
it	17
more	17
than	17
was	17
fair	17
or	17
neighbourly.	17
Don	17
Quixote	17
proceeded	17
to	17
join	17
them,	17
not	17
a	17
little	17
to	17
Sancho’s	17
uneasiness,	17
for	17
he	17
never	17
relished	17
mixing	17
himself	17
up	17
in	17
expeditions	17
of	17
that	17
sort.	17
The	17
members	17
of	17
the	17
troop	17
received	17
him	17
into	17
the	17
midst	17
of	17
them,	17
taking	17
him	17
to	17
be	17
someone	17
who	17
was	17
on	17
their	17
side.	17
Don	17
Quixote,	17
putting	17
up	17
his	17
visor,	17
advanced	17
with	17
an	17
easy	17
bearing	17
and	17
demeanour	17
to	17
the	17
standard	17
with	17
the	17
ass,	17
and	17
all	17
the	17
chief	17
men	17
of	17
the	17
army	17
gathered	17
round	17
him	17
to	17
look	17
at	17
him,	17
staring	17
at	17
him	17
with	17
the	17
usual	17
amazement	17
that	17
everybody	17
felt	17
on	17
seeing	17
him	17
for	17
the	17
first	17
time.	17
Don	17
Quixote,	17
seeing	17
them	17
examining	17
him	17
so	17
attentively,	17
and	17
that	17
none	17
of	17
them	17
spoke	17
to	17
him	17
or	17
put	17
any	17
question	17
to	17
him,	17
determined	17
to	17
take	17
advantage	17
of	17
their	17
silence;	17
so,	17
breaking	17
his	17
own,	17
he	17
lifted	17
up	17
his	17
voice	17
and	17
said,	17
“Worthy	17
sirs,	17
I	17
entreat	17
you	17
as	17
earnestly	17
as	17
I	17
can	17
not	17
to	17
interrupt	17
an	17
argument	17
I	17
wish	17
to	17
address	17
to	17
you,	17
until	17
you	17
find	17
it	17
displeases	17
or	17
wearies	17
you;	17
and	17
if	17
that	17
come	17
to	17
pass,	17
on	17
the	17
slightest	17
hint	17
you	17
give	17
me	17
I	17
will	17
put	17
a	17
seal	17
upon	17
my	17
lips	17
and	17
a	17
gag	17
upon	17
my	17
tongue.”	17
They	17
all	17
bade	17
him	17
say	17
what	17
he	17
liked,	17
for	17
they	17
would	17
listen	17
to	17
him	17
willingly.	17

With	17
this	17
permission	17
Don	17
Quixote	17
went	17
on	17
to	17
say,	17
“I,	17
sirs,	17
am	17
a	17
knight-errant	17
whose	17
calling	17
is	17
that	17
of	17
arms,	17
and	17
whose	17
profession	17
is	17
to	17
protect	17
those	17
who	17
require	17
protection,	17
and	17
give	17
help	17
to	17
such	17
as	17
stand	17
in	17
need	17
of	17
it.	17
Some	17
days	17
ago	17
I	17
became	17
acquainted	17
with	17
your	17
misfortune	17
and	17
the	17
cause	17
which	17
impels	17
you	17
to	17
take	17
up	17
arms	17
again	17
and	17
again	17
to	17
revenge	17
yourselves	17
upon	17
your	17
enemies;	17
and	17
having	17
many	17
times	17
thought	17
over	17
your	17
business	17
in	17
my	17
mind,	17
I	17
find	17
that,	17
according	17
to	17
the	17
laws	17
of	17
combat,	17
you	17
are	17
mistaken	17
in	17
holding	17
yourselves	17
insulted;	17
for	17
a	17
private	17
individual	17
cannot	17
insult	17
an	17
entire	17
community;	17
unless	17
it	17
be	17
by	17
defying	17
it	17
collectively	17
as	17
a	17
traitor,	17
because	17
he	17
cannot	17
tell	17
who	17
in	17
particular	17
is	17
guilty	17
of	17
the	17
treason	17
for	17
which	17
he	17
defies	17
it.	17
Of	17
this	17
we	17
have	17
an	17
example	17
in	17
Don	17
Diego	17
Ordoñez	17
de	17
Lara,	17
who	17
defied	17
the	17
whole	17
town	17
of	17
Zamora,	17
because	17
he	17
did	17
not	17
know	17
that	17
Vellido	17
Dolfos	17
alone	17
had	17
committed	17
the	17
treachery	17
of	17
slaying	17
his	17
king;	17
and	17
therefore	17
he	17
defied	17
them	17
all,	17
and	17
the	17
vengeance	17
and	17
the	17
reply	17
concerned	17
all;	17
though,	17
to	17
be	17
sure,	17
Señor	17
Don	17
Diego	17
went	17
rather	17
too	17
far,	17
indeed	17
very	17
much	17
beyond	17
the	17
limits	17
of	17
a	17
defiance;	17
for	17
he	17
had	17
no	17
occasion	17
to	17
defy	17
the	17
dead,	17
or	17
the	17
waters,	17
or	17
the	17
fishes,	17
or	17
those	17
yet	17
unborn,	17
and	17
all	17
the	17
rest	17
of	17
it	17
as	17
set	17
forth;	17
but	17
let	17
that	17
pass,	17
for	17
when	17
anger	17
breaks	17
out	17
there’s	17
no	17
father,	17
governor,	17
or	17
bridle	17
to	17
check	17
the	17
tongue.	17
The	17
case	17
being,	17
then,	17
that	17
no	17
one	17
person	17
can	17
insult	17
a	17
kingdom,	17
province,	17
city,	17
state,	17
or	17
entire	17
community,	17
it	17
is	17
clear	17
there	17
is	17
no	17
reason	17
for	17
going	17
out	17
to	17
avenge	17
the	17
defiance	17
of	17
such	17
an	17
insult,	17
inasmuch	17
as	17
it	17
is	17
not	17
one.	17
A	17
fine	17
thing	17
it	17
would	17
be	17
if	17
the	17
people	17
of	17
the	17
clock	17
town	17
were	17
to	17
be	17
at	17
loggerheads	17
every	17
moment	17
with	17
everyone	17
who	17
called	17
them	17
by	17
that	17
name,—or	17
the	17
Cazoleros,	17
Berengeneros,	17
Ballenatos,	17
Jaboneros,	17
or	17
the	17
bearers	17
of	17
all	17
the	17
other	17
names	17
and	17
titles	17
that	17
are	17
always	17
in	17
the	17
mouth	17
of	17
the	17
boys	17
and	17
common	17
people!	17
It	17
would	17
be	17
a	17
nice	17
business	17
indeed	17
if	17
all	17
these	17
illustrious	17
cities	17
were	17
to	17
take	17
huff	17
and	17
revenge	17
themselves	17
and	17
go	17
about	17
perpetually	17
making	17
trombones	17
of	17
their	17
swords	17
in	17
every	17
petty	17
quarrel!	17
No,	17
no;	17
God	17
forbid!	17
There	17
are	17
four	17
things	17
for	17
which	17
sensible	17
men	17
and	17
well-ordered	17
States	17
ought	17
to	17
take	17
up	17
arms,	17
draw	17
their	17
swords,	17
and	17
risk	17
their	17
persons,	17
lives,	17
and	17
properties.	17
The	17
first	17
is	17
to	17
defend	17
the	17
Catholic	17
faith;	17
the	17
second,	17
to	17
defend	17
one’s	17
life,	17
which	17
is	17
in	17
accordance	17
with	17
natural	17
and	17
divine	17
law;	17
the	17
third,	17
in	17
defence	17
of	17
one’s	17
honour,	17
family,	17
and	17
property;	17
the	17
fourth,	17
in	17
the	17
service	17
of	17
one’s	17
king	17
in	17
a	17
just	17
war;	17
and	17
if	17
to	17
these	17
we	17
choose	17
to	17
add	17
a	17
fifth	17
(which	17
may	17
be	17
included	17
in	17
the	17
second),	17
in	17
defence	17
of	17
one’s	17
country.	17
To	17
these	17
five,	17
as	17
it	17
were	17
capital	17
causes,	17
there	17
may	17
be	17
added	17
some	17
others	17
that	17
may	17
be	17
just	17
and	17
reasonable,	17
and	17
make	17
it	17
a	17
duty	17
to	17
take	17
up	17
arms;	17
but	17
to	17
take	17
them	17
up	17
for	17
trifles	17
and	17
things	17
to	17
laugh	17
at	17
and	17
be	17
amused	17
by	17
rather	17
than	17
offended,	17
looks	17
as	17
though	17
he	17
who	17
did	17
so	17
was	17
altogether	17
wanting	17
in	17
common	17
sense.	17
Moreover,	17
to	17
take	17
an	17
unjust	17
revenge	17
(and	17
there	17
cannot	17
be	17
any	17
just	17
one)	17
is	17
directly	17
opposed	17
to	17
the	17
sacred	17
law	17
that	17
we	17
acknowledge,	17
wherein	17
we	17
are	17
commanded	17
to	17
do	17
good	17
to	17
our	17
enemies	17
and	17
to	17
love	17
them	17
that	17
hate	17
us;	17
a	17
command	17
which,	17
though	17
it	17
seems	17
somewhat	17
difficult	17
to	17
obey,	17
is	17
only	17
so	17
to	17
those	17
who	17
have	17
in	17
them	17
less	17
of	17
God	17
than	17
of	17
the	17
world,	17
and	17
more	17
of	17
the	17
flesh	17
than	17
of	17
the	17
spirit;	17
for	17
Jesus	17
Christ,	17
God	17
and	17
true	17
man,	17
who	17
never	17
lied,	17
and	17
could	17
not	17
and	17
cannot	17
lie,	17
said,	17
as	17
our	17
law-giver,	17
that	17
his	17
yoke	17
was	17
easy	17
and	17
his	17
burden	17
light;	17
he	17
would	17
not,	17
therefore,	17
have	17
laid	17
any	17
command	17
upon	17
us	17
that	17
it	17
was	17
impossible	17
to	17
obey.	17
Thus,	17
sirs,	17
you	17
are	17
bound	17
to	17
keep	17
quiet	17
by	17
human	17
and	17
divine	17
law.”	17
“The	17
devil	17
take	17
me,”	17
said	17
Sancho	17
to	17
himself	17
at	17
this,	17
“but	17
this	17
master	17
of	17
mine	17
is	17
a	17
theologian;	17
or,	17
if	17
not,	17
faith,	17
he’s	17
as	17
like	17
one	17
as	17
one	17
egg	17
is	17
like	17
another.”	17
Don	17
Quixote	17
stopped	17
to	17
take	17
breath,	17
and,	17
observing	17
that	17
silence	17
was	17
still	17
preserved,	17
had	17
a	17
mind	17
to	17
continue	17
his	17
discourse,	17
and	17
would	17
have	17
done	17
so	17
had	17
not	17
Sancho	17
interposed	17
with	17
his	17
smartness;	17
for	17
he,	17
seeing	17
his	17
master	17
pause,	17
took	17
the	17
lead,	17
saying,	17
“My	17
lord	17
Don	17
Quixote	17
of	17
La	17
Mancha,	17
who	17
once	17
was	17
called	17
the	17
Knight	17
of	17
the	17
Rueful	17
Countenance,	17
but	17
now	17
is	17
called	17
the	17
Knight	17
of	17
the	17
Lions,	17
is	17
a	17
gentleman	17
of	17
great	17
discretion	17
who	17
knows	17
Latin	17
and	17
his	17
mother	17
tongue	17
like	17
a	17
bachelor,	17
and	17
in	17
everything	17
that	17
he	17
deals	17
with	17
or	17
advises	17
proceeds	17
like	17
a	17
good	17
soldier,	17
and	17
has	17
all	17
the	17
laws	17
and	17
ordinances	17
of	17
what	17
they	17
call	17
combat	17
at	17
his	17
fingers’	17
ends;	17
so	17
you	17
have	17
nothing	17
to	17
do	17
but	17
to	17
let	17
yourselves	17
be	17
guided	17
by	17
what	17
he	17
says,	17
and	17
on	17
my	17
head	17
be	17
it	17
if	17
it	17
is	17
wrong.	17
Besides	17
which,	17
you	17
have	17
been	17
told	17
that	17
it	17
is	17
folly	17
to	17
take	17
offence	17
at	17
merely	17
hearing	17
a	17
bray.	17
I	17
remember	17
when	17
I	17
was	17
a	17
boy	17
I	17
brayed	17
as	17
often	17
as	17
I	17
had	17
a	17
fancy,	17
without	17
anyone	17
hindering	17
me,	17
and	17
so	17
elegantly	17
and	17
naturally	17
that	17
when	17
I	17
brayed	17
all	17
the	17
asses	17
in	17
the	17
town	17
would	17
bray;	17
but	17
I	17
was	17
none	17
the	17
less	17
for	17
that	17
the	17
son	17
of	17
my	17
parents	17
who	17
were	17
greatly	17
respected;	17
and	17
though	17
I	17
was	17
envied	17
because	17
of	17
the	17
gift	17
by	17
more	17
than	17
one	17
of	17
the	17
high	17
and	17
mighty	17
ones	17
of	17
the	17
town,	17
I	17
did	17
not	17
care	17
two	17
farthings	17
for	17
it;	17
and	17
that	17
you	17
may	17
see	17
I	17
am	17
telling	17
the	17
truth,	17
wait	17
a	17
bit	17
and	17
listen,	17
for	17
this	17
art,	17
like	17
swimming,	17
once	17
learnt	17
is	17
never	17
forgotten;”	17
and	17
then,	17
taking	17
hold	17
of	17
his	17
nose,	17
he	17
began	17
to	17
bray	17
so	17
vigorously	17
that	17
all	17
the	17
valleys	17
around	17
rang	17
again.	17
One	17
of	17
those,	17
however,	17
that	17
stood	17
near	17
him,	17
fancying	17
he	17
was	17
mocking	17
them,	17
lifted	17
up	17
a	17
long	17
staff	17
he	17
had	17
in	17
his	17
hand	17
and	17
smote	17
him	17
such	17
a	17
blow	17
with	17
it	17
that	17
Sancho	17
dropped	17
helpless	17
to	17
the	17
ground.	17
Don	17
Quixote,	17
seeing	17
him	17
so	17
roughly	17
handled,	17
attacked	17
the	17
man	17
who	17
had	17
struck	17
him	17
lance	17
in	17
hand,	17
but	17
so	17
many	17
thrust	17
themselves	17
between	17
them	17
that	17
he	17
could	17
not	17
avenge	17
him.	17
Far	17
from	17
it,	17
finding	17
a	17
shower	17
of	17
stones	17
rained	17
upon	17
him,	17
and	17
crossbows	17
and	17
muskets	17
unnumbered	17
levelled	17
at	17
him,	17
he	17
wheeled	17
Rocinante	17
round	17
and,	17
as	17
fast	17
as	17
his	17
best	17
gallop	17
could	17
take	17
him,	17
fled	17
from	17
the	17
midst	17
of	17
them,	17
commending	17
himself	17
to	17
God	17
with	17
all	17
his	17
heart	17
to	17
deliver	17
him	17
out	17
of	17
this	17
peril,	17
in	17
dread	17
every	17
step	17
of	17
some	17
ball	17
coming	17
in	17
at	17
his	17
back	17
and	17
coming	17
out	17
at	17
his	17
breast,	17
and	17
every	17
minute	17
drawing	17
his	17
breath	17
to	17
see	17
whether	17
it	17
had	17
gone	17
from	17
him.	17
The	17
members	17
of	17
the	17
band,	17
however,	17
were	17
satisfied	17
with	17
seeing	17
him	17
take	17
to	17
flight,	17
and	17
did	17
not	17
fire	17
on	17
him.	17
They	17
put	17
up	17
Sancho,	17
scarcely	17
restored	17
to	17
his	17
senses,	17
on	17
his	17
ass,	17
and	17
let	17
him	17
go	17
after	17
his	17
master;	17
not	17
that	17
he	17
was	17
sufficiently	17
in	17
his	17
wits	17
to	17
guide	17
the	17
beast,	17
but	17
Dapple	17
followed	17
the	17
footsteps	17
of	17
Rocinante,	17
from	17
whom	17
he	17
could	17
not	17
remain	17
a	17
moment	17
separated.	17
Don	17
Quixote	17
having	17
got	17
some	17
way	17
off	17
looked	17
back,	17
and	17
seeing	17
Sancho	17
coming,	17
waited	17
for	17
him,	17
as	17
he	17
perceived	17
that	17
no	17
one	17
followed	17
him.	17
The	17
men	17
of	17
the	17
troop	17
stood	17
their	17
ground	17
till	17
night,	17
and	17
as	17
the	17
enemy	17
did	17
not	17
come	17
out	17
to	17
battle,	17
they	17
returned	17
to	17
their	17
town	17
exulting;	17
and	17
had	17
they	17
been	17
aware	17
of	17
the	17
ancient	17
custom	17
of	17
the	17
Greeks,	17
they	17
would	17
have	17
erected	17
a	17
trophy	17
on	17
the	17
spot.	17

When	17
the	17
brave	17
man	17
flees,	17
treachery	17
is	17
manifest	17
and	17
it	17
is	17
for	17
wise	17
men	17
to	17
reserve	17
themselves	17
for	17
better	17
occasions.	17
This	17
proved	17
to	17
be	17
the	17
case	17
with	17
Don	17
Quixote,	17
who,	17
giving	17
way	17
before	17
the	17
fury	17
of	17
the	17
townsfolk	17
and	17
the	17
hostile	17
intentions	17
of	17
the	17
angry	17
troop,	17
took	17
to	17
flight	17
and,	17
without	17
a	17
thought	17
of	17
Sancho	17
or	17
the	17
danger	17
in	17
which	17
he	17
was	17
leaving	17
him,	17
retreated	17
to	17
such	17
a	17
distance	17
as	17
he	17
thought	17
made	17
him	17
safe.	17
Sancho,	17
lying	17
across	17
his	17
ass,	17
followed	17
him,	17
as	17
has	17
been	17
said,	17
and	17
at	17
length	17
came	17
up,	17
having	17
by	17
this	17
time	17
recovered	17
his	17
senses,	17
and	17
on	17
joining	17
him	17
let	17
himself	17
drop	17
off	17
Dapple	17
at	17
Rocinante’s	17
feet,	17
sore,	17
bruised,	17
and	17
belaboured.	17
Don	17
Quixote	17
dismounted	17
to	17
examine	17
his	17
wounds,	17
but	17
finding	17
him	17
whole	17
from	17
head	17
to	17
foot,	17
he	17
said	17
to	17
him,	17
angrily	17
enough,	17
“In	17
an	17
evil	17
hour	17
didst	17
thou	17
take	17
to	17
braying,	17
Sancho!	17
Where	17
hast	17
thou	17
learned	17
that	17
it	17
is	17
well	17
done	17
to	17
mention	17
the	17
rope	17
in	17
the	17
house	17
of	17
the	17
man	17
that	17
has	17
been	17
hanged?	17
To	17
the	17
music	17
of	17
brays	17
what	17
harmonies	17
couldst	17
thou	17
expect	17
to	17
get	17
but	17
cudgels?	17
Give	17
thanks	17
to	17
God,	17
Sancho,	17
that	17
they	17
signed	17
the	17
cross	17
on	17
thee	17
just	17
now	17
with	17
a	17
stick,	17
and	17
did	17
not	17
mark	17
thee	17
_per	17
signum	17
crucis_	17
with	17
a	17
cutlass.”	17
“I’m	17
not	17
equal	17
to	17
answering,”	17
said	17
Sancho,	17
“for	17
I	17
feel	17
as	17
if	17
I	17
was	17
speaking	17
through	17
my	17
shoulders;	17
let	17
us	17
mount	17
and	17
get	17
away	17
from	17
this;	17
I’ll	17
keep	17
from	17
braying,	17
but	17
not	17
from	17
saying	17
that	17
knights-errant	17
fly	17
and	17
leave	17
their	17
good	17
squires	17
to	17
be	17
pounded	17
like	17
privet,	17
or	17
made	17
meal	17
of	17
at	17
the	17
hands	17
of	17
their	17
enemies.”	17
“He	17
does	17
not	17
fly	17
who	17
retires,”	17
returned	17
Don	17
Quixote;	17
“for	17
I	17
would	17
have	17
thee	17
know,	17
Sancho,	17
that	17
the	17
valour	17
which	17
is	17
not	17
based	17
upon	17
a	17
foundation	17
of	17
prudence	17
is	17
called	17
rashness,	17
and	17
the	17
exploits	17
of	17
the	17
rash	17
man	17
are	17
to	17
be	17
attributed	17
rather	17
to	17
good	17
fortune	17
than	17
to	17
courage;	17
and	17
so	17
I	17
own	17
that	17
I	17
retired,	17
but	17
not	17
that	17
I	17
fled;	17
and	17
therein	17
I	17
have	17
followed	17
the	17
example	17
of	17
many	17
valiant	17
men	17
who	17
have	17
reserved	17
themselves	17
for	17
better	17
times;	17
the	17
histories	17
are	17
full	17
of	17
instances	17
of	17
this,	17
but	17
as	17
it	17
would	17
not	17
be	17
any	17
good	17
to	17
thee	17
or	17
pleasure	17
to	17
me,	17
I	17
will	17
not	17
recount	17
them	17
to	17
thee	17
now.”	17
Sancho	17
was	17
by	17
this	17
time	17
mounted	17
with	17
the	17
help	17
of	17
Don	17
Quixote,	17
who	17
then	17
himself	17
mounted	17
Rocinante,	17
and	17
at	17
a	17
leisurely	17
pace	17
they	17
proceeded	17
to	17
take	17
shelter	17
in	17
a	17
grove	17
which	17
was	17
in	17
sight	17
about	17
a	17
quarter	17
of	17
a	17
league	17
off.	17
Every	17
now	17
and	17
then	17
Sancho	17
gave	17
vent	17
to	17
deep	17
sighs	17
and	17
dismal	17
groans,	17
and	17
on	17
Don	17
Quixote	17
asking	17
him	17
what	17
caused	17
such	17
acute	17
suffering,	17
he	17
replied	17
that,	17
from	17
the	17
end	17
of	17
his	17
back-bone	17
up	17
to	17
the	17
nape	17
of	17
his	17
neck,	17
he	17
was	17
so	17
sore	17
that	17
it	17
nearly	17
drove	17
him	17
out	17
of	17
his	17
senses.	17
“The	17
cause	17
of	17
that	17
soreness,”	17
said	17
Don	17
Quixote,	17
“will	17
be,	17
no	17
doubt,	17
that	17
the	17
staff	17
wherewith	17
they	17
smote	17
thee	17
being	17
a	17
very	17
long	17
one,	17
it	17
caught	17
thee	17
all	17
down	17
the	17
back,	17
where	17
all	17
the	17
parts	17
that	17
are	17
sore	17
are	17
situated,	17
and	17
had	17
it	17
reached	17
any	17
further	17
thou	17
wouldst	17
be	17
sorer	17
still.”	17
“By	17
God,”	17
said	17
Sancho,	17
“your	17
worship	17
has	17
relieved	17
me	17
of	17
a	17
great	17
doubt,	17
and	17
cleared	17
up	17
the	17
point	17
for	17
me	17
in	17
elegant	17
style!	17
Body	17
o’	17
me!	17
is	17
the	17
cause	17
of	17
my	17
soreness	17
such	17
a	17
mystery	17
that	17
there’s	17
any	17
need	17
to	17
tell	17
me	17
I	17
am	17
sore	17
everywhere	17
the	17
staff	17
hit	17
me?	17
If	17
it	17
was	17
my	17
ankles	17
that	17
pained	17
me	17
there	17
might	17
be	17
something	17
in	17
going	17
divining	17
why	17
they	17
did,	17
but	17
it	17
is	17
not	17
much	17
to	17
divine	17
that	17
I’m	17
sore	17
where	17
they	17
thrashed	17
me.	17
By	17
my	17
faith,	17
master	17
mine,	17
the	17
ills	17
of	17
others	17
hang	17
by	17
a	17
hair;	17
every	17
day	17
I	17
am	17
discovering	17
more	17
and	17
more	17
how	17
little	17
I	17
have	17
to	17
hope	17
for	17
from	17
keeping	17
company	17
with	17
your	17
worship;	17
for	17
if	17
this	17
time	17
you	17
have	17
allowed	17
me	17
to	17
be	17
drubbed,	17
the	17
next	17
time,	17
or	17
a	17
hundred	17
times	17
more,	17
we’ll	17
have	17
the	17
blanketings	17
of	17
the	17
other	17
day	17
over	17
again,	17
and	17
all	17
the	17
other	17
pranks	17
which,	17
if	17
they	17
have	17
fallen	17
on	17
my	17
shoulders	17
now,	17
will	17
be	17
thrown	17
in	17
my	17
teeth	17
by-and-by.	17
I	17
would	17
do	17
a	17
great	17
deal	17
better	17
(if	17
I	17
was	17
not	17
an	17
ignorant	17
brute	17
that	17
will	17
never	17
do	17
any	17
good	17
all	17
my	17
life),	17
I	17
would	17
do	17
a	17
great	17
deal	17
better,	17
I	17
say,	17
to	17
go	17
home	17
to	17
my	17
wife	17
and	17
children	17
and	17
support	17
them	17
and	17
bring	17
them	17
up	17
on	17
what	17
God	17
may	17
please	17
to	17
give	17
me,	17
instead	17
of	17
following	17
your	17
worship	17
along	17
roads	17
that	17
lead	17
nowhere	17
and	17
paths	17
that	17
are	17
none	17
at	17
all,	17
with	17
little	17
to	17
drink	17
and	17
less	17
to	17
eat.	17
And	17
then	17
when	17
it	17
comes	17
to	17
sleeping!	17
Measure	17
out	17
seven	17
feet	17
on	17
the	17
earth,	17
brother	17
squire,	17
and	17
if	17
that’s	17
not	17
enough	17
for	17
you,	17
take	17
as	17
many	17
more,	17
for	17
you	17
may	17
have	17
it	17
all	17
your	17
own	17
way	17
and	17
stretch	17
yourself	17
to	17
your	17
heart’s	17
content.	17
Oh	17
that	17
I	17
could	17
see	17
burnt	17
and	17
turned	17
to	17
ashes	17
the	17
first	17
man	17
that	17
meddled	17
with	17
knight-errantry	17
or	17
at	17
any	17
rate	17
the	17
first	17
who	17
chose	17
to	17
be	17
squire	17
to	17
such	17
fools	17
as	17
all	17
the	17
knights-errant	17
of	17
past	17
times	17
must	17
have	17
been!	17
Of	17
those	17
of	17
the	17
present	17
day	17
I	17
say	17
nothing,	17
because,	17
as	17
your	17
worship	17
is	17
one	17
of	17
them,	17
I	17
respect	17
them,	17
and	17
because	17
I	17
know	17
your	17
worship	17
knows	17
a	17
point	17
more	17
than	17
the	17
devil	17
in	17
all	17
you	17
say	17
and	17
think.”	17
“I	17
would	17
lay	17
a	17
good	17
wager	17
with	17
you,	17
Sancho,”	17
said	17
Don	17
Quixote,	17
“that	17
now	17
that	17
you	17
are	17
talking	17
on	17
without	17
anyone	17
to	17
stop	17
you,	17
you	17
don’t	17
feel	17
a	17
pain	17
in	17
your	17
whole	17
body.	17
Talk	17
away,	17
my	17
son,	17
say	17
whatever	17
comes	17
into	17
your	17
head	17
or	17
mouth,	17
for	17
so	17
long	17
as	17
you	17
feel	17
no	17
pain,	17
the	17
irritation	17
your	17
impertinences	17
give	17
me	17
will	17
be	17
a	17
pleasure	17
to	17
me;	17
and	17
if	17
you	17
are	17
so	17
anxious	17
to	17
go	17
home	17
to	17
your	17
wife	17
and	17
children,	17
God	17
forbid	17
that	17
I	17
should	17
prevent	17
you;	17
you	17
have	17
money	17
of	17
mine;	17
see	17
how	17
long	17
it	17
is	17
since	17
we	17
left	17
our	17
village	17
this	17
third	17
time,	17
and	17
how	17
much	17
you	17
can	17
and	17
ought	17
to	17
earn	17
every	17
month,	17
and	17
pay	17
yourself	17
out	17
of	17
your	17
own	17
hand.”	17
“When	17
I	17
worked	17
for	17
Tom	17
Carrasco,	17
the	17
father	17
of	17
the	17
bachelor	17
Samson	17
Carrasco	17
that	17
your	17
worship	17
knows,”	17
replied	17
Sancho,	17
“I	17
used	17
to	17
earn	17
two	17
ducats	17
a	17
month	17
besides	17
my	17
food;	17
I	17
can’t	17
tell	17
what	17
I	17
can	17
earn	17
with	17
your	17
worship,	17
though	17
I	17
know	17
a	17
knight-errant’s	17
squire	17
has	17
harder	17
times	17
of	17
it	17
than	17
he	17
who	17
works	17
for	17
a	17
farmer;	17
for	17
after	17
all,	17
we	17
who	17
work	17
for	17
farmers,	17
however	17
much	17
we	17
toil	17
all	17
day,	17
at	17
the	17
worst,	17
at	17
night,	17
we	17
have	17
our	17
olla	17
supper	17
and	17
sleep	17
in	17
a	17
bed,	17
which	17
I	17
have	17
not	17
slept	17
in	17
since	17
I	17
have	17
been	17
in	17
your	17
worship’s	17
service,	17
if	17
it	17
wasn’t	17
the	17
short	17
time	17
we	17
were	17
in	17
Don	17
Diego	17
de	17
Miranda’s	17
house,	17
and	17
the	17
feast	17
I	17
had	17
with	17
the	17
skimmings	17
I	17
took	17
off	17
Camacho’s	17
pots,	17
and	17
what	17
I	17
ate,	17
drank,	17
and	17
slept	17
in	17
Basilio’s	17
house;	17
all	17
the	17
rest	17
of	17
the	17
time	17
I	17
have	17
been	17
sleeping	17
on	17
the	17
hard	17
ground	17
under	17
the	17
open	17
sky,	17
exposed	17
to	17
what	17
they	17
call	17
the	17
inclemencies	17
of	17
heaven,	17
keeping	17
life	17
in	17
me	17
with	17
scraps	17
of	17
cheese	17
and	17
crusts	17
of	17
bread,	17
and	17
drinking	17
water	17
either	17
from	17
the	17
brooks	17
or	17
from	17
the	17
springs	17
we	17
come	17
to	17
on	17
these	17
by-paths	17
we	17
travel.”	17
“I	17
own,	17
Sancho,”	17
said	17
Don	17
Quixote,	17
“that	17
all	17
thou	17
sayest	17
is	17
true;	17
how	17
much,	17
thinkest	17
thou,	17
ought	17
I	17
to	17
give	17
thee	17
over	17
and	17
above	17
what	17
Tom	17
Carrasco	17
gave	17
thee?”	17
“I	17
think,”	17
said	17
Sancho,	17
“that	17
if	17
your	17
worship	17
was	17
to	17
add	17
on	17
two	17
reals	17
a	17
month	17
I’d	17
consider	17
myself	17
well	17
paid;	17
that	17
is,	17
as	17
far	17
as	17
the	17
wages	17
of	17
my	17
labour	17
go;	17
but	17
to	17
make	17
up	17
to	17
me	17
for	17
your	17
worship’s	17
pledge	17
and	17
promise	17
to	17
me	17
to	17
give	17
me	17
the	17
government	17
of	17
an	17
island,	17
it	17
would	17
be	17
fair	17
to	17
add	17
six	17
reals	17
more,	17
making	17
thirty	17
in	17
all.”	17
“Very	17
good,”	17
said	17
Don	17
Quixote;	17
“it	17
is	17
twenty-five	17
days	17
since	17
we	17
left	17
our	17
village,	17
so	17
reckon	17
up,	17
Sancho,	17
according	17
to	17
the	17
wages	17
you	17
have	17
made	17
out	17
for	17
yourself,	17
and	17
see	17
how	17
much	17
I	17
owe	17
you	17
in	17
proportion,	17
and	17
pay	17
yourself,	17
as	17
I	17
said	17
before,	17
out	17
of	17
your	17
own	17
hand.”	17
“O	17
body	17
o’	17
me!”	17
said	17
Sancho,	17
“but	17
your	17
worship	17
is	17
very	17
much	17
out	17
in	17
that	17
reckoning;	17
for	17
when	17
it	17
comes	17
to	17
the	17
promise	17
of	17
the	17
island	17
we	17
must	17
count	17
from	17
the	17
day	17
your	17
worship	17
promised	17
it	17
to	17
me	17
to	17
this	17
present	17
hour	17
we	17
are	17
at	17
now.”	17
“Well,	17
how	17
long	17
is	17
it,	17
Sancho,	17
since	17
I	17
promised	17
it	17
to	17
you?”	17
said	17
Don	17
Quixote.	17
“If	17
I	17
remember	17
rightly,”	17
said	17
Sancho,	17
“it	17
must	17
be	17
over	17
twenty	17
years,	17
three	17
days	17
more	17
or	17
less.”	17
Don	17
Quixote	17
gave	17
himself	17
a	17
great	17
slap	17
on	17
the	17
forehead	17
and	17
began	17
to	17
laugh	17
heartily,	17
and	17
said	17
he,	17
“Why,	17
I	17
have	17
not	17
been	17
wandering,	17
either	17
in	17
the	17
Sierra	17
Morena	17
or	17
in	17
the	17
whole	17
course	17
of	17
our	17
sallies,	17
but	17
barely	17
two	17
months,	17
and	17
thou	17
sayest,	17
Sancho,	17
that	17
it	17
is	17
twenty	17
years	17
since	17
I	17
promised	17
thee	17
the	17
island.	17
I	17
believe	17
now	17
thou	17
wouldst	17
have	17
all	17
the	17
money	17
thou	17
hast	17
of	17
mine	17
go	17
in	17
thy	17
wages.	17
If	17
so,	17
and	17
if	17
that	17
be	17
thy	17
pleasure,	17
I	17
give	17
it	17
to	17
thee	17
now,	17
once	17
and	17
for	17
all,	17
and	17
much	17
good	17
may	17
it	17
do	17
thee,	17
for	17
so	17
long	17
as	17
I	17
see	17
myself	17
rid	17
of	17
such	17
a	17
good-for-nothing	17
squire	17
I’ll	17
be	17
glad	17
to	17
be	17
left	17
a	17
pauper	17
without	17
a	17
rap.	17
But	17
tell	17
me,	17
thou	17
perverter	17
of	17
the	17
squirely	17
rules	17
of	17
knight-errantry,	17
where	17
hast	17
thou	17
ever	17
seen	17
or	17
read	17
that	17
any	17
knight-errant’s	17
squire	17
made	17
terms	17
with	17
his	17
lord,	17
‘you	17
must	17
give	17
me	17
so	17
much	17
a	17
month	17
for	17
serving	17
you’?	17
Plunge,	17
scoundrel,	17
rogue,	17
monster—for	17
such	17
I	17
take	17
thee	17
to	17
be—plunge,	17
I	17
say,	17
into	17
the	17
_mare	17
magnum_	17
of	17
their	17
histories;	17
and	17
if	17
thou	17
shalt	17
find	17
that	17
any	17
squire	17
ever	17
said	17
or	17
thought	17
what	17
thou	17
hast	17
said	17
now,	17
I	17
will	17
let	17
thee	17
nail	17
it	17
on	17
my	17
forehead,	17
and	17
give	17
me,	17
over	17
and	17
above,	17
four	17
sound	17
slaps	17
in	17
the	17
face.	17
Turn	17
the	17
rein,	17
or	17
the	17
halter,	17
of	17
thy	17
Dapple,	17
and	17
begone	17
home;	17
for	17
one	17
single	17
step	17
further	17
thou	17
shalt	17
not	17
make	17
in	17
my	17
company.	17
O	17
bread	17
thanklessly	17
received!	17
O	17
promises	17
ill-bestowed!	17
O	17
man	17
more	17
beast	17
than	17
human	17
being!	17
Now,	17
when	17
I	17
was	17
about	17
to	17
raise	17
thee	17
to	17
such	17
a	17
position,	17
that,	17
in	17
spite	17
of	17
thy	17
wife,	17
they	17
would	17
call	17
thee	17
‘my	17
lord,’	17
thou	17
art	17
leaving	17
me?	17
Thou	17
art	17
going	17
now	17
when	17
I	17
had	17
a	17
firm	17
and	17
fixed	17
intention	17
of	17
making	17
thee	17
lord	17
of	17
the	17
best	17
island	17
in	17
the	17
world?	17
Well,	17
as	17
thou	17
thyself	17
hast	17
said	17
before	17
now,	17
honey	17
is	17
not	17
for	17
the	17
mouth	17
of	17
the	17
ass.	17
Ass	17
thou	17
art,	17
ass	17
thou	17
wilt	17
be,	17
and	17
ass	17
thou	17
wilt	17
end	17
when	17
the	17
course	17
of	17
thy	17
life	17
is	17
run;	17
for	17
I	17
know	17
it	17
will	17
come	17
to	17
its	17
close	17
before	17
thou	17
dost	17
perceive	17
or	17
discern	17
that	17
thou	17
art	17
a	17
beast.”	17
Sancho	17
regarded	17
Don	17
Quixote	17
earnestly	17
while	17
he	17
was	17
giving	17
him	17
this	17
rating,	17
and	17
was	17
so	17
touched	17
by	17
remorse	17
that	17
the	17
tears	17
came	17
to	17
his	17
eyes,	17
and	17
in	17
a	17
piteous	17
and	17
broken	17
voice	17
he	17
said	17
to	17
him,	17
“Master	17
mine,	17
I	17
confess	17
that,	17
to	17
be	17
a	17
complete	17
ass,	17
all	17
I	17
want	17
is	17
a	17
tail;	17
if	17
your	17
worship	17
will	17
only	17
fix	17
one	17
on	17
to	17
me,	17
I’ll	17
look	17
on	17
it	17
as	17
rightly	17
placed,	17
and	17
I’ll	17
serve	17
you	17
as	17
an	17
ass	17
all	17
the	17
remaining	17
days	17
of	17
my	17
life.	17
Forgive	17
me	17
and	17
have	17
pity	17
on	17
my	17
folly,	17
and	17
remember	17
I	17
know	17
but	17
little,	17
and,	17
if	17
I	17
talk	17
much,	17
it’s	17
more	17
from	17
infirmity	17
than	17
malice;	17
but	17
he	17
who	17
sins	17
and	17
mends	17
commends	17
himself	17
to	17
God.”	17
“I	17
should	17
have	17
been	17
surprised,	17
Sancho,”	17
said	17
Don	17
Quixote,	17
“if	17
thou	17
hadst	17
not	17
introduced	17
some	17
bit	17
of	17
a	17
proverb	17
into	17
thy	17
speech.	17
Well,	17
well,	17
I	17
forgive	17
thee,	17
provided	17
thou	17
dost	17
mend	17
and	17
not	17
show	17
thyself	17
in	17
future	17
so	17
fond	17
of	17
thine	17
own	17
interest,	17
but	17
try	17
to	17
be	17
of	17
good	17
cheer	17
and	17
take	17
heart,	17
and	17
encourage	17
thyself	17
to	17
look	17
forward	17
to	17
the	17
fulfillment	17
of	17
my	17
promises,	17
which,	17
by	17
being	17
delayed,	17
does	17
not	17
become	17
impossible.”	17
Sancho	17
said	17
he	17
would	17
do	17
so,	17
and	17
keep	17
up	17
his	17
heart	17
as	17
best	17
he	17
could.	17
They	17
then	17
entered	17
the	17
grove,	17
and	17
Don	17
Quixote	17
settled	17
himself	17
at	17
the	17
foot	17
of	17
an	17
elm,	17
and	17
Sancho	17
at	17
that	17
of	17
a	17
beech,	17
for	17
trees	17
of	17
this	17
kind	17
and	17
others	17
like	17
them	17
always	17
have	17
feet	17
but	17
no	17
hands.	17
Sancho	17
passed	17
the	17
night	17
in	17
pain,	17
for	17
with	17
the	17
evening	17
dews	17
the	17
blow	17
of	17
the	17
staff	17
made	17
itself	17
felt	17
all	17
the	17
more.	17
Don	17
Quixote	17
passed	17
it	17
in	17
his	17
never-failing	17
meditations;	17
but,	17
for	17
all	17
that,	17
they	17
had	17
some	17
winks	17
of	17
sleep,	17
and	17
with	17
the	17
appearance	17
of	17
daylight	17
they	17
pursued	17
their	17
journey	17
in	17
quest	17
of	17
the	17
banks	17
of	17
the	17
famous	17
Ebro,	17
where	17
that	17
befell	17
them	17
which	17
will	17
be	17
told	17
in	17
the	17
following	17
chapter.	17

By	17
stages	17
as	17
already	17
described	17
or	17
left	17
undescribed,	17
two	17
days	17
after	17
quitting	17
the	17
grove	17
Don	17
Quixote	17
and	17
Sancho	17
reached	17
the	17
river	17
Ebro,	17
and	17
the	17
sight	17
of	17
it	17
was	17
a	17
great	17
delight	17
to	17
Don	17
Quixote	17
as	17
he	17
contemplated	17
and	17
gazed	17
upon	17
the	17
charms	17
of	17
its	17
banks,	17
the	17
clearness	17
of	17
its	17
stream,	17
the	17
gentleness	17
of	17
its	17
current	17
and	17
the	17
abundance	17
of	17
its	17
crystal	17
waters;	17
and	17
the	17
pleasant	17
view	17
revived	17
a	17
thousand	17
tender	17
thoughts	17
in	17
his	17
mind.	17
Above	17
all,	17
he	17
dwelt	17
upon	17
what	17
he	17
had	17
seen	17
in	17
the	17
cave	17
of	17
Montesinos;	17
for	17
though	17
Master	17
Pedro’s	17
ape	17
had	17
told	17
him	17
that	17
of	17
those	17
things	17
part	17
was	17
true,	17
part	17
false,	17
he	17
clung	17
more	17
to	17
their	17
truth	17
than	17
to	17
their	17
falsehood,	17
the	17
very	17
reverse	17
of	17
Sancho,	17
who	17
held	17
them	17
all	17
to	17
be	17
downright	17
lies.	17
As	17
they	17
were	17
thus	17
proceeding,	17
then,	17
they	17
discovered	17
a	17
small	17
boat,	17
without	17
oars	17
or	17
any	17
other	17
gear,	17
that	17
lay	17
at	17
the	17
water’s	17
edge	17
tied	17
to	17
the	17
stem	17
of	17
a	17
tree	17
growing	17
on	17
the	17
bank.	17
Don	17
Quixote	17
looked	17
all	17
round,	17
and	17
seeing	17
nobody,	17
at	17
once,	17
without	17
more	17
ado,	17
dismounted	17
from	17
Rocinante	17
and	17
bade	17
Sancho	17
get	17
down	17
from	17
Dapple	17
and	17
tie	17
both	17
beasts	17
securely	17
to	17
the	17
trunk	17
of	17
a	17
poplar	17
or	17
willow	17
that	17
stood	17
there.	17
Sancho	17
asked	17
him	17
the	17
reason	17
of	17
this	17
sudden	17
dismounting	17
and	17
tying.	17
Don	17
Quixote	17
made	17
answer,	17
“Thou	17
must	17
know,	17
Sancho,	17
that	17
this	17
bark	17
is	17
plainly,	17
and	17
without	17
the	17
possibility	17
of	17
any	17
alternative,	17
calling	17
and	17
inviting	17
me	17
to	17
enter	17
it,	17
and	17
in	17
it	17
go	17
to	17
give	17
aid	17
to	17
some	17
knight	17
or	17
other	17
person	17
of	17
distinction	17
in	17
need	17
of	17
it,	17
who	17
is	17
no	17
doubt	17
in	17
some	17
sore	17
strait;	17
for	17
this	17
is	17
the	17
way	17
of	17
the	17
books	17
of	17
chivalry	17
and	17
of	17
the	17
enchanters	17
who	17
figure	17
and	17
speak	17
in	17
them.	17
When	17
a	17
knight	17
is	17
involved	17
in	17
some	17
difficulty	17
from	17
which	17
he	17
cannot	17
be	17
delivered	17
save	17
by	17
the	17
hand	17
of	17
another	17
knight,	17
though	17
they	17
may	17
be	17
at	17
a	17
distance	17
of	17
two	17
or	17
three	17
thousand	17
leagues	17
or	17
more	17
one	17
from	17
the	17
other,	17
they	17
either	17
take	17
him	17
up	17
on	17
a	17
cloud,	17
or	17
they	17
provide	17
a	17
bark	17
for	17
him	17
to	17
get	17
into,	17
and	17
in	17
less	17
than	17
the	17
twinkling	17
of	17
an	17
eye	17
they	17
carry	17
him	17
where	17
they	17
will	17
and	17
where	17
his	17
help	17
is	17
required;	17
and	17
so,	17
Sancho,	17
this	17
bark	17
is	17
placed	17
here	17
for	17
the	17
same	17
purpose;	17
this	17
is	17
as	17
true	17
as	17
that	17
it	17
is	17
now	17
day,	17
and	17
ere	17
this	17
one	17
passes	17
tie	17
Dapple	17
and	17
Rocinante	17
together,	17
and	17
then	17
in	17
God’s	17
hand	17
be	17
it	17
to	17
guide	17
us;	17
for	17
I	17
would	17
not	17
hold	17
back	17
from	17
embarking,	17
though	17
barefooted	17
friars	17
were	17
to	17
beg	17
me.”	17
“As	17
that’s	17
the	17
case,”	17
said	17
Sancho,	17
“and	17
your	17
worship	17
chooses	17
to	17
give	17
in	17
to	17
these—I	17
don’t	17
know	17
if	17
I	17
may	17
call	17
them	17
absurdities—at	17
every	17
turn,	17
there’s	17
nothing	17
for	17
it	17
but	17
to	17
obey	17
and	17
bow	17
the	17
head,	17
bearing	17
in	17
mind	17
the	17
proverb,	17
‘Do	17
as	17
thy	17
master	17
bids	17
thee,	17
and	17
sit	17
down	17
to	17
table	17
with	17
him;’	17
but	17
for	17
all	17
that,	17
for	17
the	17
sake	17
of	17
easing	17
my	17
conscience,	17
I	17
warn	17
your	17
worship	17
that	17
it	17
is	17
my	17
opinion	17
this	17
bark	17
is	17
no	17
enchanted	17
one,	17
but	17
belongs	17
to	17
some	17
of	17
the	17
fishermen	17
of	17
the	17
river,	17
for	17
they	17
catch	17
the	17
best	17
shad	17
in	17
the	17
world	17
here.”	17
As	17
Sancho	17
said	17
this,	17
he	17
tied	17
the	17
beasts,	17
leaving	17
them	17
to	17
the	17
care	17
and	17
protection	17
of	17
the	17
enchanters	17
with	17
sorrow	17
enough	17
in	17
his	17
heart.	17
Don	17
Quixote	17
bade	17
him	17
not	17
be	17
uneasy	17
about	17
deserting	17
the	17
animals,	17
“for	17
he	17
who	17
would	17
carry	17
themselves	17
over	17
such	17
longinquous	17
roads	17
and	17
regions	17
would	17
take	17
care	17
to	17
feed	17
them.”	17
“I	17
don’t	17
understand	17
that	17
logiquous,”	17
said	17
Sancho,	17
“nor	17
have	17
I	17
ever	17
heard	17
the	17
word	17
all	17
the	17
days	17
of	17
my	17
life.”	17
“Longinquous,”	17
replied	17
Don	17
Quixote,	17
“means	17
far	17
off;	17
but	17
it	17
is	17
no	17
wonder	17
thou	17
dost	17
not	17
understand	17
it,	17
for	17
thou	17
art	17
not	17
bound	17
to	17
know	17
Latin,	17
like	17
some	17
who	17
pretend	17
to	17
know	17
it	17
and	17
don’t.”	17
“Now	17
they	17
are	17
tied,”	17
said	17
Sancho;	17
“what	17
are	17
we	17
to	17
do	17
next?”	17
“What?”	17
said	17
Don	17
Quixote,	17
“cross	17
ourselves	17
and	17
weigh	17
anchor;	17
I	17
mean,	17
embark	17
and	17
cut	17
the	17
moorings	17
by	17
which	17
the	17
bark	17
is	17
held;”	17
and	17
the	17
bark	17
began	17
to	17
drift	17
away	17
slowly	17
from	17
the	17
bank.	17
But	17
when	17
Sancho	17
saw	17
himself	17
somewhere	17
about	17
two	17
yards	17
out	17
in	17
the	17
river,	17
he	17
began	17
to	17
tremble	17
and	17
give	17
himself	17
up	17
for	17
lost;	17
but	17
nothing	17
distressed	17
him	17
more	17
than	17
hearing	17
Dapple	17
bray	17
and	17
seeing	17
Rocinante	17
struggling	17
to	17
get	17
loose,	17
and	17
said	17
he	17
to	17
his	17
master,	17
“Dapple	17
is	17
braying	17
in	17
grief	17
at	17
our	17
leaving	17
him,	17
and	17
Rocinante	17
is	17
trying	17
to	17
escape	17
and	17
plunge	17
in	17
after	17
us.	17
O	17
dear	17
friends,	17
peace	17
be	17
with	17
you,	17
and	17
may	17
this	17
madness	17
that	17
is	17
taking	17
us	17
away	17
from	17
you,	17
turned	17
into	17
sober	17
sense,	17
bring	17
us	17
back	17
to	17
you.”	17
And	17
with	17
this	17
he	17
fell	17
weeping	17
so	17
bitterly,	17
that	17
Don	17
Quixote	17
said	17
to	17
him,	17
sharply	17
and	17
angrily,	17
“What	17
art	17
thou	17
afraid	17
of,	17
cowardly	17
creature?	17
What	17
art	17
thou	17
weeping	17
at,	17
heart	17
of	17
butter-paste?	17
Who	17
pursues	17
or	17
molests	17
thee,	17
thou	17
soul	17
of	17
a	17
tame	17
mouse?	17
What	17
dost	17
thou	17
want,	17
unsatisfied	17
in	17
the	17
very	17
heart	17
of	17
abundance?	17
Art	17
thou,	17
perchance,	17
tramping	17
barefoot	17
over	17
the	17
Riphaean	17
mountains,	17
instead	17
of	17
being	17
seated	17
on	17
a	17
bench	17
like	17
an	17
archduke	17
on	17
the	17
tranquil	17
stream	17
of	17
this	17
pleasant	17
river,	17
from	17
which	17
in	17
a	17
short	17
space	17
we	17
shall	17
come	17
out	17
upon	17
the	17
broad	17
sea?	17
But	17
we	17
must	17
have	17
already	17
emerged	17
and	17
gone	17
seven	17
hundred	17
or	17
eight	17
hundred	17
leagues;	17
and	17
if	17
I	17
had	17
here	17
an	17
astrolabe	17
to	17
take	17
the	17
altitude	17
of	17
the	17
pole,	17
I	17
could	17
tell	17
thee	17
how	17
many	17
we	17
have	17
travelled,	17
though	17
either	17
I	17
know	17
little,	17
or	17
we	17
have	17
already	17
crossed	17
or	17
shall	17
shortly	17
cross	17
the	17
equinoctial	17
line	17
which	17
parts	17
the	17
two	17
opposite	17
poles	17
midway.”	17
“And	17
when	17
we	17
come	17
to	17
that	17
line	17
your	17
worship	17
speaks	17
of,”	17
said	17
Sancho,	17
“how	17
far	17
shall	17
we	17
have	17
gone?”	17
“Very	17
far,”	17
said	17
Don	17
Quixote,	17
“for	17
of	17
the	17
three	17
hundred	17
and	17
sixty	17
degrees	17
that	17
this	17
terraqueous	17
globe	17
contains,	17
as	17
computed	17
by	17
Ptolemy,	17
the	17
greatest	17
cosmographer	17
known,	17
we	17
shall	17
have	17
travelled	17
one-half	17
when	17
we	17
come	17
to	17
the	17
line	17
I	17
spoke	17
of.”	17
“By	17
God,”	17
said	17
Sancho,	17
“your	17
worship	17
gives	17
me	17
a	17
nice	17
authority	17
for	17
what	17
you	17
say,	17
putrid	17
Dolly	17
something	17
transmogrified,	17
or	17
whatever	17
it	17
is.”	17
Don	17
Quixote	17
laughed	17
at	17
the	17
interpretation	17
Sancho	17
put	17
upon	17
“computed,”	17
and	17
the	17
name	17
of	17
the	17
cosmographer	17
Ptolemy,	17
and	17
said	17
he,	17
“Thou	17
must	17
know,	17
Sancho,	17
that	17
with	17
the	17
Spaniards	17
and	17
those	17
who	17
embark	17
at	17
Cadiz	17
for	17
the	17
East	17
Indies,	17
one	17
of	17
the	17
signs	17
they	17
have	17
to	17
show	17
them	17
when	17
they	17
have	17
passed	17
the	17
equinoctial	17
line	17
I	17
told	17
thee	17
of,	17
is,	17
that	17
the	17
lice	17
die	17
upon	17
everybody	17
on	17
board	17
the	17
ship,	17
and	17
not	17
a	17
single	17
one	17
is	17
left,	17
or	17
to	17
be	17
found	17
in	17
the	17
whole	17
vessel	17
if	17
they	17
gave	17
its	17
weight	17
in	17
gold	17
for	17
it;	17
so,	17
Sancho,	17
thou	17
mayest	17
as	17
well	17
pass	17
thy	17
hand	17
down	17
thy	17
thigh,	17
and	17
if	17
thou	17
comest	17
upon	17
anything	17
alive	17
we	17
shall	17
be	17
no	17
longer	17
in	17
doubt;	17
if	17
not,	17
then	17
we	17
have	17
crossed.”	17
“I	17
don’t	17
believe	17
a	17
bit	17
of	17
it,”	17
said	17
Sancho;	17
“still,	17
I’ll	17
do	17
as	17
your	17
worship	17
bids	17
me;	17
though	17
I	17
don’t	17
know	17
what	17
need	17
there	17
is	17
for	17
trying	17
these	17
experiments,	17
for	17
I	17
can	17
see	17
with	17
my	17
own	17
eyes	17
that	17
we	17
have	17
not	17
moved	17
five	17
yards	17
away	17
from	17
the	17
bank,	17
or	17
shifted	17
two	17
yards	17
from	17
where	17
the	17
animals	17
stand,	17
for	17
there	17
are	17
Rocinante	17
and	17
Dapple	17
in	17
the	17
very	17
same	17
place	17
where	17
we	17
left	17
them;	17
and	17
watching	17
a	17
point,	17
as	17
I	17
do	17
now,	17
I	17
swear	17
by	17
all	17
that’s	17
good,	17
we	17
are	17
not	17
stirring	17
or	17
moving	17
at	17
the	17
pace	17
of	17
an	17
ant.”	17
“Try	17
the	17
test	17
I	17
told	17
thee	17
of,	17
Sancho,”	17
said	17
Don	17
Quixote,	17
“and	17
don’t	17
mind	17
any	17
other,	17
for	17
thou	17
knowest	17
nothing	17
about	17
colures,	17
lines,	17
parallels,	17
zodiacs,	17
ecliptics,	17
poles,	17
solstices,	17
equinoxes,	17
planets,	17
signs,	17
bearings,	17
the	17
measures	17
of	17
which	17
the	17
celestial	17
and	17
terrestrial	17
spheres	17
are	17
composed;	17
if	17
thou	17
wert	17
acquainted	17
with	17
all	17
these	17
things,	17
or	17
any	17
portion	17
of	17
them,	17
thou	17
wouldst	17
see	17
clearly	17
how	17
many	17
parallels	17
we	17
have	17
cut,	17
what	17
signs	17
we	17
have	17
seen,	17
and	17
what	17
constellations	17
we	17
have	17
left	17
behind	17
and	17
are	17
now	17
leaving	17
behind.	17
But	17
again	17
I	17
tell	17
thee,	17
feel	17
and	17
hunt,	17
for	17
I	17
am	17
certain	17
thou	17
art	17
cleaner	17
than	17
a	17
sheet	17
of	17
smooth	17
white	17
paper.”	17
Sancho	17
felt,	17
and	17
passing	17
his	17
hand	17
gently	17
and	17
carefully	17
down	17
to	17
the	17
hollow	17
of	17
his	17
left	17
knee,	17
he	17
looked	17
up	17
at	17
his	17
master	17
and	17
said,	17
“Either	17
the	17
test	17
is	17
a	17
false	17
one,	17
or	17
we	17
have	17
not	17
come	17
to	17
where	17
your	17
worship	17
says,	17
nor	17
within	17
many	17
leagues	17
of	17
it.”	17
“Why,	17
how	17
so?”	17
asked	17
Don	17
Quixote;	17
“hast	17
thou	17
come	17
upon	17
aught?”	17
“Ay,	17
and	17
aughts,”	17
replied	17
Sancho;	17
and	17
shaking	17
his	17
fingers	17
he	17
washed	17
his	17
whole	17
hand	17
in	17
the	17
river	17
along	17
which	17
the	17
boat	17
was	17
quietly	17
gliding	17
in	17
midstream,	17
not	17
moved	17
by	17
any	17
occult	17
intelligence	17
or	17
invisible	17
enchanter,	17
but	17
simply	17
by	17
the	17
current,	17
just	17
there	17
smooth	17
and	17
gentle.	17
They	17
now	17
came	17
in	17
sight	17
of	17
some	17
large	17
water	17
mills	17
that	17
stood	17
in	17
the	17
middle	17
of	17
the	17
river,	17
and	17
the	17
instant	17
Don	17
Quixote	17
saw	17
them	17
he	17
cried	17
out,	17
“Seest	17
thou	17
there,	17
my	17
friend?	17
there	17
stands	17
the	17
castle	17
or	17
fortress,	17
where	17
there	17
is,	17
no	17
doubt,	17
some	17
knight	17
in	17
durance,	17
or	17
ill-used	17
queen,	17
or	17
infanta,	17
or	17
princess,	17
in	17
whose	17
aid	17
I	17
am	17
brought	17
hither.”	17
“What	17
the	17
devil	17
city,	17
fortress,	17
or	17
castle	17
is	17
your	17
worship	17
talking	17
about,	17
señor?”	17
said	17
Sancho;	17
“don’t	17
you	17
see	17
that	17
those	17
are	17
mills	17
that	17
stand	17
in	17
the	17
river	17
to	17
grind	17
corn?”	17
“Hold	17
thy	17
peace,	17
Sancho,”	17
said	17
Don	17
Quixote;	17
“though	17
they	17
look	17
like	17
mills	17
they	17
are	17
not	17
so;	17
I	17
have	17
already	17
told	17
thee	17
that	17
enchantments	17
transform	17
things	17
and	17
change	17
their	17
proper	17
shapes;	17
I	17
do	17
not	17
mean	17
to	17
say	17
they	17
really	17
change	17
them	17
from	17
one	17
form	17
into	17
another,	17
but	17
that	17
it	17
seems	17
as	17
though	17
they	17
did,	17
as	17
experience	17
proved	17
in	17
the	17
transformation	17
of	17
Dulcinea,	17
sole	17
refuge	17
of	17
my	17
hopes.”	17
By	17
this	17
time,	17
the	17
boat,	17
having	17
reached	17
the	17
middle	17
of	17
the	17
stream,	17
began	17
to	17
move	17
less	17
slowly	17
than	17
hitherto.	17
The	17
millers	17
belonging	17
to	17
the	17
mills,	17
when	17
they	17
saw	17
the	17
boat	17
coming	17
down	17
the	17
river,	17
and	17
on	17
the	17
point	17
of	17
being	17
sucked	17
in	17
by	17
the	17
draught	17
of	17
the	17
wheels,	17
ran	17
out	17
in	17
haste,	17
several	17
of	17
them,	17
with	17
long	17
poles	17
to	17
stop	17
it,	17
and	17
being	17
all	17
mealy,	17
with	17
faces	17
and	17
garments	17
covered	17
with	17
flour,	17
they	17
presented	17
a	17
sinister	17
appearance.	17
They	17
raised	17
loud	17
shouts,	17
crying,	17
“Devils	17
of	17
men,	17
where	17
are	17
you	17
going	17
to?	17
Are	17
you	17
mad?	17
Do	17
you	17
want	17
to	17
drown	17
yourselves,	17
or	17
dash	17
yourselves	17
to	17
pieces	17
among	17
these	17
wheels?”	17
“Did	17
I	17
not	17
tell	17
thee,	17
Sancho,”	17
said	17
Don	17
Quixote	17
at	17
this,	17
“that	17
we	17
had	17
reached	17
the	17
place	17
where	17
I	17
am	17
to	17
show	17
what	17
the	17
might	17
of	17
my	17
arm	17
can	17
do?	17
See	17
what	17
ruffians	17
and	17
villains	17
come	17
out	17
against	17
me;	17
see	17
what	17
monsters	17
oppose	17
me;	17
see	17
what	17
hideous	17
countenances	17
come	17
to	17
frighten	17
us!	17
You	17
shall	17
soon	17
see,	17
scoundrels!”	17
And	17
then	17
standing	17
up	17
in	17
the	17
boat	17
he	17
began	17
in	17
a	17
loud	17
voice	17
to	17
hurl	17
threats	17
at	17
the	17
millers,	17
exclaiming,	17
“Ill-conditioned	17
and	17
worse-counselled	17
rabble,	17
restore	17
to	17
liberty	17
and	17
freedom	17
the	17
person	17
ye	17
hold	17
in	17
durance	17
in	17
this	17
your	17
fortress	17
or	17
prison,	17
high	17
or	17
low	17
or	17
of	17
whatever	17
rank	17
or	17
quality	17
he	17
be,	17
for	17
I	17
am	17
Don	17
Quixote	17
of	17
La	17
Mancha,	17
otherwise	17
called	17
the	17
Knight	17
of	17
the	17
Lions,	17
for	17
whom,	17
by	17
the	17
disposition	17
of	17
heaven	17
above,	17
it	17
is	17
reserved	17
to	17
give	17
a	17
happy	17
issue	17
to	17
this	17
adventure;”	17
and	17
so	17
saying	17
he	17
drew	17
his	17
sword	17
and	17
began	17
making	17
passes	17
in	17
the	17
air	17
at	17
the	17
millers,	17
who,	17
hearing	17
but	17
not	17
understanding	17
all	17
this	17
nonsense,	17
strove	17
to	17
stop	17
the	17
boat,	17
which	17
was	17
now	17
getting	17
into	17
the	17
rushing	17
channel	17
of	17
the	17
wheels.	17
Sancho	17
fell	17
upon	17
his	17
knees	17
devoutly	17
appealing	17
to	17
heaven	17
to	17
deliver	17
him	17
from	17
such	17
imminent	17
peril;	17
which	17
it	17
did	17
by	17
the	17
activity	17
and	17
quickness	17
of	17
the	17
millers,	17
who,	17
pushing	17
against	17
the	17
boat	17
with	17
their	17
poles,	17
stopped	17
it,	17
not,	17
however,	17
without	17
upsetting	17
and	17
throwing	17
Don	17
Quixote	17
and	17
Sancho	17
into	17
the	17
water;	17
and	17
lucky	17
it	17
was	17
for	17
Don	17
Quixote	17
that	17
he	17
could	17
swim	17
like	17
a	17
goose,	17
though	17
the	17
weight	17
of	17
his	17
armour	17
carried	17
him	17
twice	17
to	17
the	17
bottom;	17
and	17
had	17
it	17
not	17
been	17
for	17
the	17
millers,	17
who	17
plunged	17
in	17
and	17
hoisted	17
them	17
both	17
out,	17
it	17
would	17
have	17
been	17
Troy	17
town	17
with	17
the	17
pair	17
of	17
them.	17
As	17
soon	17
as,	17
more	17
drenched	17
than	17
thirsty,	17
they	17
were	17
landed,	17
Sancho	17
went	17
down	17
on	17
his	17
knees	17
and	17
with	17
clasped	17
hands	17
and	17
eyes	17
raised	17
to	17
heaven,	17
prayed	17
a	17
long	17
and	17
fervent	17
prayer	17
to	17
God	17
to	17
deliver	17
him	17
evermore	17
from	17
the	17
rash	17
projects	17
and	17
attempts	17
of	17
his	17
master.	17
The	17
fishermen,	17
the	17
owners	17
of	17
the	17
boat,	17
which	17
the	17
mill-wheels	17
had	17
knocked	17
to	17
pieces,	17
now	17
came	17
up,	17
and	17
seeing	17
it	17
smashed	17
they	17
proceeded	17
to	17
strip	17
Sancho	17
and	17
to	17
demand	17
payment	17
for	17
it	17
from	17
Don	17
Quixote;	17
but	17
he	17
with	17
great	17
calmness,	17
just	17
as	17
if	17
nothing	17
had	17
happened	17
him,	17
told	17
the	17
millers	17
and	17
fishermen	17
that	17
he	17
would	17
pay	17
for	17
the	17
bark	17
most	17
cheerfully,	17
on	17
condition	17
that	17
they	17
delivered	17
up	17
to	17
him,	17
free	17
and	17
unhurt,	17
the	17
person	17
or	17
persons	17
that	17
were	17
in	17
durance	17
in	17
that	17
castle	17
of	17
theirs.	17

“What	17
persons	17
or	17
what	17
castle	17
art	17
thou	17
talking	17
of,	17
madman?	17
Art	17
thou	17
for	17
carrying	17
off	17
the	17
people	17
who	17
come	17
to	17
grind	17
corn	17
in	17
these	17
mills?”	17
“That’s	17
enough,”	17
said	17
Don	17
Quixote	17
to	17
himself,	17
“it	17
would	17
be	17
preaching	17
in	17
the	17
desert	17
to	17
attempt	17
by	17
entreaties	17
to	17
induce	17
this	17
rabble	17
to	17
do	17
any	17
virtuous	17
action.	17
In	17
this	17
adventure	17
two	17
mighty	17
enchanters	17
must	17
have	17
encountered	17
one	17
another,	17
and	17
one	17
frustrates	17
what	17
the	17
other	17
attempts;	17
one	17
provided	17
the	17
bark	17
for	17
me,	17
and	17
the	17
other	17
upset	17
me;	17
God	17
help	17
us,	17
this	17
world	17
is	17
all	17
machinations	17
and	17
schemes	17
at	17
cross	17
purposes	17
one	17
with	17
the	17
other.	17
I	17
can	17
do	17
no	17
more.”	17
And	17
then	17
turning	17
towards	17
the	17
mills	17
he	17
said	17
aloud,	17
“Friends,	17
whoe’er	17
ye	17
be	17
that	17
are	17
immured	17
in	17
that	17
prison,	17
forgive	17
me	17
that,	17
to	17
my	17
misfortune	17
and	17
yours,	17
I	17
cannot	17
deliver	17
you	17
from	17
your	17
misery;	17
this	17
adventure	17
is	17
doubtless	17
reserved	17
and	17
destined	17
for	17
some	17
other	17
knight.”	17
So	17
saying	17
he	17
settled	17
with	17
the	17
fishermen,	17
and	17
paid	17
fifty	17
reals	17
for	17
the	17
boat,	17
which	17
Sancho	17
handed	17
to	17
them	17
very	17
much	17
against	17
the	17
grain,	17
saying,	17
“With	17
a	17
couple	17
more	17
bark	17
businesses	17
like	17
this	17
we	17
shall	17
have	17
sunk	17
our	17
whole	17
capital.”	17
The	17
fishermen	17
and	17
the	17
millers	17
stood	17
staring	17
in	17
amazement	17
at	17
the	17
two	17
figures,	17
so	17
very	17
different	17
to	17
all	17
appearance	17
from	17
ordinary	17
men,	17
and	17
were	17
wholly	17
unable	17
to	17
make	17
out	17
the	17
drift	17
of	17
the	17
observations	17
and	17
questions	17
Don	17
Quixote	17
addressed	17
to	17
them;	17
and	17
coming	17
to	17
the	17
conclusion	17
that	17
they	17
were	17
madmen,	17
they	17
left	17
them	17
and	17
betook	17
themselves,	17
the	17
millers	17
to	17
their	17
mills,	17
and	17
the	17
fishermen	17
to	17
their	17
huts.	17
Don	17
Quixote	17
and	17
Sancho	17
returned	17
to	17
their	17
beasts,	17
and	17
to	17
their	17
life	17
of	17
beasts,	17

They	17
reached	17
their	17
beasts	17
in	17
low	17
spirits	17
and	17
bad	17
humour	17
enough,	17
knight	17
and	17
squire,	17
Sancho	17
particularly,	17
for	17
with	17
him	17
what	17
touched	17
the	17
stock	17
of	17
money	17
touched	17
his	17
heart,	17
and	17
when	17
any	17
was	17
taken	17
from	17
him	17
he	17
felt	17
as	17
if	17
he	17
was	17
robbed	17
of	17
the	17
apples	17
of	17
his	17
eyes.	17
In	17
fine,	17
without	17
exchanging	17
a	17
word,	17
they	17
mounted	17
and	17
quitted	17
the	17
famous	17
river,	17
Don	17
Quixote	17
absorbed	17
in	17
thoughts	17
of	17
his	17
love,	17
Sancho	17
in	17
thinking	17
of	17
his	17
advancement,	17
which	17
just	17
then,	17
it	17
seemed	17
to	17
him,	17
he	17
was	17
very	17
far	17
from	17
securing;	17
for,	17
fool	17
as	17
he	17
was,	17
he	17
saw	17
clearly	17
enough	17
that	17
his	17
master’s	17
acts	17
were	17
all	17
or	17
most	17
of	17
them	17
utterly	17
senseless;	17
and	17
he	17
began	17
to	17
cast	17
about	17
for	17
an	17
opportunity	17
of	17
retiring	17
from	17
his	17
service	17
and	17
going	17
home	17
some	17
day,	17
without	17
entering	17
into	17
any	17
explanations	17
or	17
taking	17
any	17
farewell	17
of	17
him.	17
Fortune,	17
however,	17
ordered	17
matters	17
after	17
a	17
fashion	17
very	17
much	17
the	17
opposite	17
of	17
what	17
he	17
contemplated.	17
It	17
so	17
happened	17
that	17
the	17
next	17
day	17
towards	17
sunset,	17
on	17
coming	17
out	17
of	17
a	17
wood,	17
Don	17
Quixote	17
cast	17
his	17
eyes	17
over	17
a	17
green	17
meadow,	17
and	17
at	17
the	17
far	17
end	17
of	17
it	17
observed	17
some	17
people,	17
and	17
as	17
he	17
drew	17
nearer	17
saw	17
that	17
it	17
was	17
a	17
hawking	17
party.	17
Coming	17
closer,	17
he	17
distinguished	17
among	17
them	17
a	17
lady	17
of	17
graceful	17
mien,	17
on	17
a	17
pure	17
white	17
palfrey	17
or	17
hackney	17
caparisoned	17
with	17
green	17
trappings	17
and	17
a	17
silver-mounted	17
side-saddle.	17
The	17
lady	17
was	17
also	17
in	17
green,	17
and	17
so	17
richly	17
and	17
splendidly	17
dressed	17
that	17
splendour	17
itself	17
seemed	17
personified	17
in	17
her.	17
On	17
her	17
left	17
hand	17
she	17
bore	17
a	17
hawk,	17
a	17
proof	17
to	17
Don	17
Quixote’s	17
mind	17
that	17
she	17
must	17
be	17
some	17
great	17
lady	17
and	17
the	17
mistress	17
of	17
the	17
whole	17
hunting	17
party,	17
which	17
was	17
the	17
fact;	17
so	17
he	17
said	17
to	17
Sancho,	17
“Run	17
Sancho,	17
my	17
son,	17
and	17
say	17
to	17
that	17
lady	17
on	17
the	17
palfrey	17
with	17
the	17
hawk	17
that	17
I,	17
the	17
Knight	17
of	17
the	17
Lions,	17
kiss	17
the	17
hands	17
of	17
her	17
exalted	17
beauty,	17
and	17
if	17
her	17
excellence	17
will	17
grant	17
me	17
leave	17
I	17
will	17
go	17
and	17
kiss	17
them	17
in	17
person	17
and	17
place	17
myself	17
at	17
her	17
service	17
for	17
aught	17
that	17
may	17
be	17
in	17
my	17
power	17
and	17
her	17
highness	17
may	17
command;	17
and	17
mind,	17
Sancho,	17
how	17
thou	17
speakest,	17
and	17
take	17
care	17
not	17
to	17
thrust	17
in	17
any	17
of	17
thy	17
proverbs	17
into	17
thy	17
message.”	17

“You’ve	17
got	17
a	17
likely	17
one	17
here	17
to	17
thrust	17
any	17
in!”	17
said	17
Sancho;	17
“leave	17
me	17
alone	17
for	17
that!	17
Why,	17
this	17
is	17
not	17
the	17
first	17
time	17
in	17
my	17
life	17
I	17
have	17
carried	17
messages	17
to	17
high	17
and	17
exalted	17
ladies.”	17
“Except	17
that	17
thou	17
didst	17
carry	17
to	17
the	17
lady	17
Dulcinea,”	17
said	17
Don	17
Quixote,	17
“I	17
know	17
not	17
that	17
thou	17
hast	17
carried	17
any	17
other,	17
at	17
least	17
in	17
my	17
service.”	17
“That	17
is	17
true,”	17
replied	17
Sancho;	17
“but	17
pledges	17
don’t	17
distress	17
a	17
good	17
payer,	17
and	17
in	17
a	17
house	17
where	17
there’s	17
plenty	17
supper	17
is	17
soon	17
cooked;	17
I	17
mean	17
there’s	17
no	17
need	17
of	17
telling	17
or	17
warning	17
me	17
about	17
anything;	17
for	17
I’m	17
ready	17
for	17
everything	17
and	17
know	17
a	17
little	17
of	17
everything.”	17
“That	17
I	17
believe,	17
Sancho,”	17
said	17
Don	17
Quixote;	17
“go	17
and	17
good	17
luck	17
to	17
thee,	17
and	17
God	17
speed	17
thee.”	17
Sancho	17
went	17
off	17
at	17
top	17
speed,	17
forcing	17
Dapple	17
out	17
of	17
his	17
regular	17
pace,	17
and	17
came	17
to	17
where	17
the	17
fair	17
huntress	17
was	17
standing,	17
and	17
dismounting	17
knelt	17
before	17
her	17
and	17
said,	17
“Fair	17
lady,	17
that	17
knight	17
that	17
you	17
see	17
there,	17
the	17
Knight	17
of	17
the	17
Lions	17
by	17
name,	17
is	17
my	17
master,	17
and	17
I	17
am	17
a	17
squire	17
of	17
his,	17
and	17
at	17
home	17
they	17
call	17
me	17
Sancho	17
Panza.	17
This	17
same	17
Knight	17
of	17
the	17
Lions,	17
who	17
was	17
called	17
not	17
long	17
since	17
the	17
Knight	17
of	17
the	17
Rueful	17
Countenance,	17
sends	17
by	17
me	17
to	17
say	17
may	17
it	17
please	17
your	17
highness	17
to	17
give	17
him	17
leave	17
that,	17
with	17
your	17
permission,	17
approbation,	17
and	17
consent,	17
he	17
may	17
come	17
and	17
carry	17
out	17
his	17
wishes,	17
which	17
are,	17
as	17
he	17
says	17
and	17
I	17
believe,	17
to	17
serve	17
your	17
exalted	17
loftiness	17
and	17
beauty;	17
and	17
if	17
you	17
give	17
it,	17
your	17
ladyship	17
will	17
do	17
a	17
thing	17
which	17
will	17
redound	17
to	17
your	17
honour,	17
and	17
he	17
will	17
receive	17
a	17
most	17
distinguished	17
favour	17
and	17
happiness.”	17
“You	17
have	17
indeed,	17
squire,”	17
said	17
the	17
lady,	17
“delivered	17
your	17
message	17
with	17
all	17
the	17
formalities	17
such	17
messages	17
require;	17
rise	17
up,	17
for	17
it	17
is	17
not	17
right	17
that	17
the	17
squire	17
of	17
a	17
knight	17
so	17
great	17
as	17
he	17
of	17
the	17
Rueful	17
Countenance,	17
of	17
whom	17
we	17
have	17
heard	17
a	17
great	17
deal	17
here,	17
should	17
remain	17
on	17
his	17
knees;	17
rise,	17
my	17
friend,	17
and	17
bid	17
your	17
master	17
welcome	17
to	17
the	17
services	17
of	17
myself	17
and	17
the	17
duke	17
my	17
husband,	17
in	17
a	17
country	17
house	17
we	17
have	17
here.”	17
Sancho	17
got	17
up,	17
charmed	17
as	17
much	17
by	17
the	17
beauty	17
of	17
the	17
good	17
lady	17
as	17
by	17
her	17
high-bred	17
air	17
and	17
her	17
courtesy,	17
but,	17
above	17
all,	17
by	17
what	17
she	17
had	17
said	17
about	17
having	17
heard	17
of	17
his	17
master,	17
the	17
Knight	17
of	17
the	17
Rueful	17
Countenance;	17
for	17
if	17
she	17
did	17
not	17
call	17
him	17
Knight	17
of	17
the	17
Lions	17
it	17
was	17
no	17
doubt	17
because	17
he	17
had	17
so	17
lately	17
taken	17
the	17
name.	17
“Tell	17
me,	17
brother	17
squire,”	17
asked	17
the	17
duchess	17
(whose	17
title,	17
however,	17
is	17
not	17
known),	17
“this	17
master	17
of	17
yours,	17
is	17
he	17
not	17
one	17
of	17
whom	17
there	17
is	17
a	17
history	17
extant	17
in	17
print,	17
called	17
‘The	17
Ingenious	17
Gentleman,	17
Don	17
Quixote	17
of	17
La	17
Mancha,’	17
who	17
has	17
for	17
the	17
lady	17
of	17
his	17
heart	17
a	17
certain	17
Dulcinea	17
del	17
Toboso?”	17
“He	17
is	17
the	17
same,	17
señora,”	17
replied	17
Sancho;	17
“and	17
that	17
squire	17
of	17
his	17
who	17
figures,	17
or	17
ought	17
to	17
figure,	17
in	17
the	17
said	17
history	17
under	17
the	17
name	17
of	17
Sancho	17
Panza,	17
is	17
myself,	17
unless	17
they	17
have	17
changed	17
me	17
in	17
the	17
cradle,	17
I	17
mean	17
in	17
the	17
press.”	17
“I	17
am	17
rejoiced	17
at	17
all	17
this,”	17
said	17
the	17
duchess;	17
“go,	17
brother	17
Panza,	17
and	17
tell	17
your	17
master	17
that	17
he	17
is	17
welcome	17
to	17
my	17
estate,	17
and	17
that	17
nothing	17
could	17
happen	17
to	17
me	17
that	17
could	17
give	17
me	17
greater	17
pleasure.”	17
Sancho	17
returned	17
to	17
his	17
master	17
mightily	17
pleased	17
with	17
this	17
gratifying	17
answer,	17
and	17
told	17
him	17
all	17
the	17
great	17
lady	17
had	17
said	17
to	17
him,	17
lauding	17
to	17
the	17
skies,	17
in	17
his	17
rustic	17
phrase,	17
her	17
rare	17
beauty,	17
her	17
graceful	17
gaiety,	17
and	17
her	17
courtesy.	17
Don	17
Quixote	17
drew	17
himself	17
up	17
briskly	17
in	17
his	17
saddle,	17
fixed	17
himself	17
in	17
his	17
stirrups,	17
settled	17
his	17
visor,	17
gave	17
Rocinante	17
the	17
spur,	17
and	17
with	17
an	17
easy	17
bearing	17
advanced	17
to	17
kiss	17
the	17
hands	17
of	17
the	17
duchess,	17
who,	17
having	17
sent	17
to	17
summon	17
the	17
duke	17
her	17
husband,	17
told	17
him	17
while	17
Don	17
Quixote	17
was	17
approaching	17
all	17
about	17
the	17
message;	17
and	17
as	17
both	17
of	17
them	17
had	17
read	17
the	17
First	17
Part	17
of	17
this	17
history,	17
and	17
from	17
it	17
were	17
aware	17
of	17
Don	17
Quixote’s	17
crazy	17
turn,	17
they	17
awaited	17
him	17
with	17
the	17
greatest	17
delight	17
and	17
anxiety	17
to	17
make	17
his	17
acquaintance,	17
meaning	17
to	17
fall	17
in	17
with	17
his	17
humour	17
and	17
agree	17
with	17
everything	17
he	17
said,	17
and,	17
so	17
long	17
as	17
he	17
stayed	17
with	17
them,	17
to	17
treat	17
him	17
as	17
a	17
knight-errant,	17
with	17
all	17
the	17
ceremonies	17
usual	17
in	17
the	17
books	17
of	17
chivalry	17
they	17
had	17
read,	17
for	17
they	17
themselves	17
were	17
very	17
fond	17
of	17
them.	17
Don	17
Quixote	17
now	17
came	17
up	17
with	17
his	17
visor	17
raised,	17
and	17
as	17
he	17
seemed	17
about	17
to	17
dismount	17
Sancho	17
made	17
haste	17
to	17
go	17
and	17
hold	17
his	17
stirrup	17
for	17
him;	17
but	17
in	17
getting	17
down	17
off	17
Dapple	17
he	17
was	17
so	17
unlucky	17
as	17
to	17
hitch	17
his	17
foot	17
in	17
one	17
of	17
the	17
ropes	17
of	17
the	17
pack-saddle	17
in	17
such	17
a	17
way	17
that	17
he	17
was	17
unable	17
to	17
free	17
it,	17
and	17
was	17
left	17
hanging	17
by	17
it	17
with	17
his	17
face	17
and	17
breast	17
on	17
the	17
ground.	17
Don	17
Quixote,	17
who	17
was	17
not	17
used	17
to	17
dismount	17
without	17
having	17
the	17
stirrup	17
held,	17
fancying	17
that	17
Sancho	17
had	17
by	17
this	17
time	17
come	17
to	17
hold	17
it	17
for	17
him,	17
threw	17
himself	17
off	17
with	17
a	17
lurch	17
and	17
brought	17
Rocinante’s	17
saddle	17
after	17
him,	17
which	17
was	17
no	17
doubt	17
badly	17
girthed,	17
and	17
saddle	17
and	17
he	17
both	17
came	17
to	17
the	17
ground;	17
not	17
without	17
discomfiture	17
to	17
him	17
and	17
abundant	17
curses	17
muttered	17
between	17
his	17
teeth	17
against	17
the	17
unlucky	17
Sancho,	17
who	17
had	17
his	17
foot	17
still	17
in	17
the	17
shackles.	17
The	17
duke	17
ordered	17
his	17
huntsmen	17
to	17
go	17
to	17
the	17
help	17
of	17
knight	17
and	17
squire,	17
and	17
they	17
raised	17
Don	17
Quixote,	17
sorely	17
shaken	17
by	17
his	17
fall;	17
and	17
he,	17
limping,	17
advanced	17
as	17
best	17
he	17
could	17
to	17
kneel	17
before	17
the	17
noble	17
pair.	17
This,	17
however,	17
the	17
duke	17
would	17
by	17
no	17
means	17
permit;	17
on	17
the	17
contrary,	17
dismounting	17
from	17
his	17
horse,	17
he	17
went	17
and	17
embraced	17
Don	17
Quixote,	17
saying,	17
“I	17
am	17
grieved,	17
Sir	17
Knight	17
of	17
the	17
Rueful	17
Countenance,	17
that	17
your	17
first	17
experience	17
on	17
my	17
ground	17
should	17
have	17
been	17
such	17
an	17
unfortunate	17
one	17
as	17
we	17
have	17
seen;	17
but	17
the	17
carelessness	17
of	17
squires	17
is	17
often	17
the	17
cause	17
of	17
worse	17
accidents.”	17
“That	17
which	17
has	17
happened	17
me	17
in	17
meeting	17
you,	17
mighty	17
prince,”	17
replied	17
Don	17
Quixote,	17
“cannot	17
be	17
unfortunate,	17
even	17
if	17
my	17
fall	17
had	17
not	17
stopped	17
short	17
of	17
the	17
depths	17
of	17
the	17
bottomless	17
pit,	17
for	17
the	17
glory	17
of	17
having	17
seen	17
you	17
would	17
have	17
lifted	17
me	17
up	17
and	17
delivered	17
me	17
from	17
it.	17
My	17
squire,	17
God’s	17
curse	17
upon	17
him,	17
is	17
better	17
at	17
unloosing	17
his	17
tongue	17
in	17
talking	17
impertinence	17
than	17
in	17
tightening	17
the	17
girths	17
of	17
a	17
saddle	17
to	17
keep	17
it	17
steady;	17
but	17
however	17
I	17
may	17
be,	17
fallen	17
or	17
raised	17
up,	17
on	17
foot	17
or	17
on	17
horseback,	17
I	17
shall	17
always	17
be	17
at	17
your	17
service	17
and	17
that	17
of	17
my	17
lady	17
the	17
duchess,	17
your	17
worthy	17
consort,	17
worthy	17
queen	17
of	17
beauty	17
and	17
paramount	17
princess	17
of	17
courtesy.”	17
“Gently,	17
Señor	17
Don	17
Quixote	17
of	17
La	17
Mancha,”	17
said	17
the	17
duke;	17
“where	17
my	17
lady	17
Doña	17
Dulcinea	17
del	17
Toboso	17
is,	17
it	17
is	17
not	17
right	17
that	17
other	17
beauties	17
should	17
be	17
praised.”	17
Sancho,	17
by	17
this	17
time	17
released	17
from	17
his	17
entanglement,	17
was	17
standing	17
by,	17
and	17
before	17
his	17
master	17
could	17
answer	17
he	17
said,	17
“There	17
is	17
no	17
denying,	17
and	17
it	17
must	17
be	17
maintained,	17
that	17
my	17
lady	17
Dulcinea	17
del	17
Toboso	17
is	17
very	17
beautiful;	17
but	17
the	17
hare	17
jumps	17
up	17
where	17
one	17
least	17
expects	17
it;	17
and	17
I	17
have	17
heard	17
say	17
that	17
what	17
we	17
call	17
nature	17
is	17
like	17
a	17
potter	17
that	17
makes	17
vessels	17
of	17
clay,	17
and	17
he	17
who	17
makes	17
one	17
fair	17
vessel	17
can	17
as	17
well	17
make	17
two,	17
or	17
three,	17
or	17
a	17
hundred;	17
I	17
say	17
so	17
because,	17
by	17
my	17
faith,	17
my	17
lady	17
the	17
duchess	17
is	17
in	17
no	17
way	17
behind	17
my	17
mistress	17
the	17
lady	17
Dulcinea	17
del	17
Toboso.”	17
Don	17
Quixote	17
turned	17
to	17
the	17
duchess	17
and	17
said,	17
“Your	17
highness	17
may	17
conceive	17
that	17
never	17
had	17
knight-errant	17
in	17
this	17
world	17
a	17
more	17
talkative	17
or	17
a	17
droller	17
squire	17
than	17
I	17
have,	17
and	17
he	17
will	17
prove	17
the	17
truth	17
of	17
what	17
I	17
say,	17
if	17
your	17
highness	17
is	17
pleased	17
to	17
accept	17
of	17
my	17
services	17
for	17
a	17
few	17
days.”	17
To	17
which	17
the	17
duchess	17
made	17
answer,	17
“that	17
worthy	17
Sancho	17
is	17
droll	17
I	17
consider	17
a	17
very	17
good	17
thing,	17
because	17
it	17
is	17
a	17
sign	17
that	17
he	17
is	17
shrewd;	17
for	17
drollery	17
and	17
sprightliness,	17
Señor	17
Don	17
Quixote,	17
as	17
you	17
very	17
well	17
know,	17
do	17
not	17
take	17
up	17
their	17
abode	17
with	17
dull	17
wits;	17
and	17
as	17
good	17
Sancho	17
is	17
droll	17
and	17
sprightly	17
I	17
here	17
set	17
him	17
down	17
as	17
shrewd.”	17
“And	17
talkative,”	17
added	17
Don	17
Quixote.	17
“So	17
much	17
the	17
better,”	17
said	17
the	17
duke,	17
“for	17
many	17
droll	17
things	17
cannot	17
be	17
said	17
in	17
few	17
words;	17
but	17
not	17
to	17
lose	17
time	17
in	17
talking,	17
come,	17
great	17
Knight	17
of	17
the	17
Rueful	17
Countenance—”	17
“Of	17
the	17
Lions,	17
your	17
highness	17
must	17
say,”	17
said	17
Sancho,	17
“for	17
there	17
is	17
no	17
Rueful	17
Countenance	17
nor	17
any	17
such	17
character	17
now.”	17
“He	17
of	17
the	17
Lions	17
be	17
it,”	17
continued	17
the	17
duke;	17
“I	17
say,	17
let	17
Sir	17
Knight	17
of	17
the	17
Lions	17
come	17
to	17
a	17
castle	17
of	17
mine	17
close	17
by,	17
where	17
he	17
shall	17
be	17
given	17
that	17
reception	17
which	17
is	17
due	17
to	17
so	17
exalted	17
a	17
personage,	17
and	17
which	17
the	17
duchess	17
and	17
I	17
are	17
wont	17
to	17
give	17
to	17
all	17
knights-errant	17
who	17
come	17
there.”	17
By	17
this	17
time	17
Sancho	17
had	17
fixed	17
and	17
girthed	17
Rocinante’s	17
saddle,	17
and	17
Don	17
Quixote	17
having	17
got	17
on	17
his	17
back	17
and	17
the	17
duke	17
mounted	17
a	17
fine	17
horse,	17
they	17
placed	17
the	17
duchess	17
in	17
the	17
middle	17
and	17
set	17
out	17
for	17
the	17
castle.	17
The	17
duchess	17
desired	17
Sancho	17
to	17
come	17
to	17
her	17
side,	17
for	17
she	17
found	17
infinite	17
enjoyment	17
in	17
listening	17
to	17
his	17
shrewd	17
remarks.	17
Sancho	17
required	17
no	17
pressing,	17
but	17
pushed	17
himself	17
in	17
between	17
them	17
and	17
the	17
duke,	17
who	17
thought	17
it	17
rare	17
good	17
fortune	17
to	17
receive	17
such	17
a	17
knight-errant	17
and	17
such	17
a	17
homely	17
squire	17
in	17
their	17
castle.	17

Supreme	17
was	17
the	17
satisfaction	17
that	17
Sancho	17
felt	17
at	17
seeing	17
himself,	17
as	17
it	17
seemed,	17
an	17
established	17
favourite	17
with	17
the	17
duchess,	17
for	17
he	17
looked	17
forward	17
to	17
finding	17
in	17
her	17
castle	17
what	17
he	17
had	17
found	17
in	17
Don	17
Diego’s	17
house	17
and	17
in	17
Basilio’s;	17
he	17
was	17
always	17
fond	17
of	17
good	17
living,	17
and	17
always	17
seized	17
by	17
the	17
forelock	17
any	17
opportunity	17
of	17
feasting	17
himself	17
whenever	17
it	17
presented	17
itself.	17
The	17
history	17
informs	17
us,	17
then,	17
that	17
before	17
they	17
reached	17
the	17
country	17
house	17
or	17
castle,	17
the	17
duke	17
went	17
on	17
in	17
advance	17
and	17
instructed	17
all	17
his	17
servants	17
how	17
they	17
were	17
to	17
treat	17
Don	17
Quixote;	17
and	17
so	17
the	17
instant	17
he	17
came	17
up	17
to	17
the	17
castle	17
gates	17
with	17
the	17
duchess,	17
two	17
lackeys	17
or	17
equerries,	17
clad	17
in	17
what	17
they	17
call	17
morning	17
gowns	17
of	17
fine	17
crimson	17
satin	17
reaching	17
to	17
their	17
feet,	17
hastened	17
out,	17
and	17
catching	17
Don	17
Quixote	17
in	17
their	17
arms	17
before	17
he	17
saw	17
or	17
heard	17
them,	17
said	17
to	17
him,	17
“Your	17
highness	17
should	17
go	17
and	17
take	17
my	17
lady	17
the	17
duchess	17
off	17
her	17
horse.”	17

Don	17
Quixote	17
obeyed,	17
and	17
great	17
bandying	17
of	17
compliments	17
followed	17
between	17
the	17
two	17
over	17
the	17
matter;	17
but	17
in	17
the	17
end	17
the	17
duchess’s	17
determination	17
carried	17
the	17
day,	17
and	17
she	17
refused	17
to	17
get	17
down	17
or	17
dismount	17
from	17
her	17
palfrey	17
except	17
in	17
the	17
arms	17
of	17
the	17
duke,	17
saying	17
she	17
did	17
not	17
consider	17
herself	17
worthy	17
to	17
impose	17
so	17
unnecessary	17
a	17
burden	17
on	17
so	17
great	17
a	17
knight.	17
At	17
length	17
the	17
duke	17
came	17
out	17
to	17
take	17
her	17
down,	17
and	17
as	17
they	17
entered	17
a	17
spacious	17
court	17
two	17
fair	17
damsels	17
came	17
forward	17
and	17
threw	17
over	17
Don	17
Quixote’s	17
shoulders	17
a	17
large	17
mantle	17
of	17
the	17
finest	17
scarlet	17
cloth,	17
and	17
at	17
the	17
same	17
instant	17
all	17
the	17
galleries	17
of	17
the	17
court	17
were	17
lined	17
with	17
the	17
men-servants	17
and	17
women-servants	17
of	17
the	17
household,	17
crying,	17
“Welcome,	17
flower	17
and	17
cream	17
of	17
knight-errantry!”	17
while	17
all	17
or	17
most	17
of	17
them	17
flung	17
pellets	17
filled	17
with	17
scented	17
water	17
over	17
Don	17
Quixote	17
and	17
the	17
duke	17
and	17
duchess;	17
at	17
all	17
which	17
Don	17
Quixote	17
was	17
greatly	17
astonished,	17
and	17
this	17
was	17
the	17
first	17
time	17
that	17
he	17
thoroughly	17
felt	17
and	17
believed	17
himself	17
to	17
be	17
a	17
knight-errant	17
in	17
reality	17
and	17
not	17
merely	17
in	17
fancy,	17
now	17
that	17
he	17
saw	17
himself	17
treated	17
in	17
the	17
same	17
way	17
as	17
he	17
had	17
read	17
of	17
such	17
knights	17
being	17
treated	17
in	17
days	17
of	17
yore.	17
Sancho,	17
deserting	17
Dapple,	17
hung	17
on	17
to	17
the	17
duchess	17
and	17
entered	17
the	17
castle,	17
but	17
feeling	17
some	17
twinges	17
of	17
conscience	17
at	17
having	17
left	17
the	17
ass	17
alone,	17
he	17
approached	17
a	17
respectable	17
duenna	17
who	17
had	17
come	17
out	17
with	17
the	17
rest	17
to	17
receive	17
the	17
duchess,	17
and	17
in	17
a	17
low	17
voice	17
he	17
said	17
to	17
her,	17
“Señora	17
Gonzalez,	17
or	17
however	17
your	17
grace	17
may	17
be	17
called—”	17
“I	17
am	17
called	17
Doña	17
Rodriguez	17
de	17
Grijalba,”	17
replied	17
the	17
duenna;	17
“what	17
is	17
your	17
will,	17
brother?”	17
To	17
which	17
Sancho	17
made	17
answer,	17
“I	17
should	17
be	17
glad	17
if	17
your	17
worship	17
would	17
do	17
me	17
the	17
favour	17
to	17
go	17
out	17
to	17
the	17
castle	17
gate,	17
where	17
you	17
will	17
find	17
a	17
grey	17
ass	17
of	17
mine;	17
make	17
them,	17
if	17
you	17
please,	17
put	17
him	17
in	17
the	17
stable,	17
or	17
put	17
him	17
there	17
yourself,	17
for	17
the	17
poor	17
little	17
beast	17
is	17
rather	17
easily	17
frightened,	17
and	17
cannot	17
bear	17
being	17
alone	17
at	17
all.”	17
“If	17
the	17
master	17
is	17
as	17
wise	17
as	17
the	17
man,”	17
said	17
the	17
duenna,	17
“we	17
have	17
got	17
a	17
fine	17
bargain.	17
Be	17
off	17
with	17
you,	17
brother,	17
and	17
bad	17
luck	17
to	17
you	17
and	17
him	17
who	17
brought	17
you	17
here;	17
go,	17
look	17
after	17
your	17
ass,	17
for	17
we,	17
the	17
duennas	17
of	17
this	17
house,	17
are	17
not	17
used	17
to	17
work	17
of	17
that	17
sort.”	17
“Well	17
then,	17
in	17
troth,”	17
returned	17
Sancho,	17
“I	17
have	17
heard	17
my	17
master,	17
who	17
is	17
the	17
very	17
treasure-finder	17
of	17
stories,	17
telling	17
the	17
story	17
of	17
Lancelot	17
when	17
he	17
came	17
from	17
Britain,	17
say	17
that	17
ladies	17
waited	17
upon	17
him	17
and	17
duennas	17
upon	17
his	17
hack;	17
and,	17
if	17
it	17
comes	17
to	17
my	17
ass,	17
I	17
wouldn’t	17
change	17
him	17
for	17
Señor	17
Lancelot’s	17
hack.”	17
“If	17
you	17
are	17
a	17
jester,	17
brother,”	17
said	17
the	17
duenna,	17
“keep	17
your	17
drolleries	17
for	17
some	17
place	17
where	17
they’ll	17
pass	17
muster	17
and	17
be	17
paid	17
for;	17
for	17
you’ll	17
get	17
nothing	17
from	17
me	17
but	17
a	17
fig.”	17
“At	17
any	17
rate,	17
it	17
will	17
be	17
a	17
very	17
ripe	17
one,”	17
said	17
Sancho,	17
“for	17
you	17
won’t	17
lose	17
the	17
trick	17
in	17
years	17
by	17
a	17
point	17
too	17
little.”	17
“Son	17
of	17
a	17
bitch,”	17
said	17
the	17
duenna,	17
all	17
aglow	17
with	17
anger,	17
“whether	17
I’m	17
old	17
or	17
not,	17
it’s	17
with	17
God	17
I	17
have	17
to	17
reckon,	17
not	17
with	17
you,	17
you	17
garlic-stuffed	17
scoundrel!”	17
and	17
she	17
said	17
it	17
so	17
loud,	17
that	17
the	17
duchess	17
heard	17
it,	17
and	17
turning	17
round	17
and	17
seeing	17
the	17
duenna	17
in	17
such	17
a	17
state	17
of	17
excitement,	17
and	17
her	17
eyes	17
flaming	17
so,	17
asked	17
whom	17
she	17
was	17
wrangling	17
with.	17
“With	17
this	17
good	17
fellow	17
here,”	17
said	17
the	17
duenna,	17
“who	17
has	17
particularly	17
requested	17
me	17
to	17
go	17
and	17
put	17
an	17
ass	17
of	17
his	17
that	17
is	17
at	17
the	17
castle	17
gate	17
into	17
the	17
stable,	17
holding	17
it	17
up	17
to	17
me	17
as	17
an	17
example	17
that	17
they	17
did	17
the	17
same	17
I	17
don’t	17
know	17
where—that	17
some	17
ladies	17
waited	17
on	17
one	17
Lancelot,	17
and	17
duennas	17
on	17
his	17
hack;	17
and	17
what	17
is	17
more,	17
to	17
wind	17
up	17
with,	17
he	17
called	17
me	17
old.”	17
“That,”	17
said	17
the	17
duchess,	17
“I	17
should	17
have	17
considered	17
the	17
greatest	17
affront	17
that	17
could	17
be	17
offered	17
me;”	17
and	17
addressing	17
Sancho,	17
she	17
said	17
to	17
him,	17
“You	17
must	17
know,	17
friend	17
Sancho,	17
that	17
Doña	17
Rodriguez	17
is	17
very	17
youthful,	17
and	17
that	17
she	17
wears	17
that	17
hood	17
more	17
for	17
authority	17
and	17
custom’s	17
sake	17
than	17
because	17
of	17
her	17
years.”	17
“May	17
all	17
the	17
rest	17
of	17
mine	17
be	17
unlucky,”	17
said	17
Sancho,	17
“if	17
I	17
meant	17
it	17
that	17
way;	17
I	17
only	17
spoke	17
because	17
the	17
affection	17
I	17
have	17
for	17
my	17
ass	17
is	17
so	17
great,	17
and	17
I	17
thought	17
I	17
could	17
not	17
commend	17
him	17
to	17
a	17
more	17
kind-hearted	17
person	17
than	17
the	17
lady	17
Doña	17
Rodriguez.”	17
Don	17
Quixote,	17
who	17
was	17
listening,	17
said	17
to	17
him,	17
“Is	17
this	17
proper	17
conversation	17
for	17
the	17
place,	17
Sancho?”	17
“Señor,”	17
replied	17
Sancho,	17
“every	17
one	17
must	17
mention	17
what	17
he	17
wants	17
wherever	17
he	17
may	17
be;	17
I	17
thought	17
of	17
Dapple	17
here,	17
and	17
I	17
spoke	17
of	17
him	17
here;	17
if	17
I	17
had	17
thought	17
of	17
him	17
in	17
the	17
stable	17
I	17
would	17
have	17
spoken	17
there.”	17
On	17
which	17
the	17
duke	17
observed,	17
“Sancho	17
is	17
quite	17
right,	17
and	17
there	17
is	17
no	17
reason	17
at	17
all	17
to	17
find	17
fault	17
with	17
him;	17
Dapple	17
shall	17
be	17
fed	17
to	17
his	17
heart’s	17
content,	17
and	17
Sancho	17
may	17
rest	17
easy,	17
for	17
he	17
shall	17
be	17
treated	17
like	17
himself.”	17
While	17
this	17
conversation,	17
amusing	17
to	17
all	17
except	17
Don	17
Quixote,	17
was	17
proceeding,	17
they	17
ascended	17
the	17
staircase	17
and	17
ushered	17
Don	17
Quixote	17
into	17
a	17
chamber	17
hung	17
with	17
rich	17
cloth	17
of	17
gold	17
and	17
brocade;	17
six	17
damsels	17
relieved	17
him	17
of	17
his	17
armour	17
and	17
waited	17
on	17
him	17
like	17
pages,	17
all	17
of	17
them	17
prepared	17
and	17
instructed	17
by	17
the	17
duke	17
and	17
duchess	17
as	17
to	17
what	17
they	17
were	17
to	17
do,	17
and	17
how	17
they	17
were	17
to	17
treat	17
Don	17
Quixote,	17
so	17
that	17
he	17
might	17
see	17
and	17
believe	17
they	17
were	17
treating	17
him	17
like	17
a	17
knight-errant.	17
When	17
his	17
armour	17
was	17
removed,	17
there	17
stood	17
Don	17
Quixote	17
in	17
his	17
tight-fitting	17
breeches	17
and	17
chamois	17
doublet,	17
lean,	17
lanky,	17
and	17
long,	17
with	17
cheeks	17
that	17
seemed	17
to	17
be	17
kissing	17
each	17
other	17
inside;	17
such	17
a	17
figure,	17
that	17
if	17
the	17
damsels	17
waiting	17
on	17
him	17
had	17
not	17
taken	17
care	17
to	17
check	17
their	17
merriment	17
(which	17
was	17
one	17
of	17
the	17
particular	17
directions	17
their	17
master	17
and	17
mistress	17
had	17
given	17
them),	17
they	17
would	17
have	17
burst	17
with	17
laughter.	17
They	17
asked	17
him	17
to	17
let	17
himself	17
be	17
stripped	17
that	17
they	17
might	17
put	17
a	17
shirt	17
on	17
him,	17
but	17
he	17
would	17
not	17
on	17
any	17
account,	17
saying	17
that	17
modesty	17
became	17
knights-errant	17
just	17
as	17
much	17
as	17
valour.	17
However,	17
he	17
said	17
they	17
might	17
give	17
the	17
shirt	17
to	17
Sancho;	17
and	17
shutting	17
himself	17
in	17
with	17
him	17
in	17
a	17
room	17
where	17
there	17
was	17
a	17
sumptuous	17
bed,	17
he	17
undressed	17
and	17
put	17
on	17
the	17
shirt;	17
and	17
then,	17
finding	17
himself	17
alone	17
with	17
Sancho,	17
he	17
said	17
to	17
him,	17
“Tell	17
me,	17
thou	17
new-fledged	17
buffoon	17
and	17
old	17
booby,	17
dost	17
thou	17
think	17
it	17
right	17
to	17
offend	17
and	17
insult	17
a	17
duenna	17
so	17
deserving	17
of	17
reverence	17
and	17
respect	17
as	17
that	17
one	17
just	17
now?	17
Was	17
that	17
a	17
time	17
to	17
bethink	17
thee	17
of	17
thy	17
Dapple,	17
or	17
are	17
these	17
noble	17
personages	17
likely	17
to	17
let	17
the	17
beasts	17
fare	17
badly	17
when	17
they	17
treat	17
their	17
owners	17
in	17
such	17
elegant	17
style?	17
For	17
God’s	17
sake,	17
Sancho,	17
restrain	17
thyself,	17
and	17
don’t	17
show	17
the	17
thread	17
so	17
as	17
to	17
let	17
them	17
see	17
what	17
a	17
coarse,	17
boorish	17
texture	17
thou	17
art	17
of.	17
Remember,	17
sinner	17
that	17
thou	17
art,	17
the	17
master	17
is	17
the	17
more	17
esteemed	17
the	17
more	17
respectable	17
and	17
well-bred	17
his	17
servants	17
are;	17
and	17
that	17
one	17
of	17
the	17
greatest	17
advantages	17
that	17
princes	17
have	17
over	17
other	17
men	17
is	17
that	17
they	17
have	17
servants	17
as	17
good	17
as	17
themselves	17
to	17
wait	17
on	17
them.	17
Dost	17
thou	17
not	17
see—shortsighted	17
being	17
that	17
thou	17
art,	17
and	17
unlucky	17
mortal	17
that	17
I	17
am!—that	17
if	17
they	17
perceive	17
thee	17
to	17
be	17
a	17
coarse	17
clown	17
or	17
a	17
dull	17
blockhead,	17
they	17
will	17
suspect	17
me	17
to	17
be	17
some	17
impostor	17
or	17
swindler?	17
Nay,	17
nay,	17
Sancho	17
friend,	17
keep	17
clear,	17
oh,	17
keep	17
clear	17
of	17
these	17
stumbling-blocks;	17
for	17
he	17
who	17
falls	17
into	17
the	17
way	17
of	17
being	17
a	17
chatterbox	17
and	17
droll,	17
drops	17
into	17
a	17
wretched	17
buffoon	17
the	17
first	17
time	17
he	17
trips;	17
bridle	17
thy	17
tongue,	17
consider	17
and	17
weigh	17
thy	17
words	17
before	17
they	17
escape	17
thy	17
mouth,	17
and	17
bear	17
in	17
mind	17
we	17
are	17
now	17
in	17
quarters	17
whence,	17
by	17
God’s	17
help,	17
and	17
the	17
strength	17
of	17
my	17
arm,	17
we	17
shall	17
come	17
forth	17
mightily	17
advanced	17
in	17
fame	17
and	17
fortune.”	17
Sancho	17
promised	17
him	17
with	17
much	17
earnestness	17
to	17
keep	17
his	17
mouth	17
shut,	17
and	17
to	17
bite	17
off	17
his	17
tongue	17
before	17
he	17
uttered	17
a	17
word	17
that	17
was	17
not	17
altogether	17
to	17
the	17
purpose	17
and	17
well	17
considered,	17
and	17
told	17
him	17
he	17
might	17
make	17
his	17
mind	17
easy	17
on	17
that	17
point,	17
for	17
it	17
should	17
never	17
be	17
discovered	17
through	17
him	17
what	17
they	17
were.	17
Don	17
Quixote	17
dressed	17
himself,	17
put	17
on	17
his	17
baldric	17
with	17
his	17
sword,	17
threw	17
the	17
scarlet	17
mantle	17
over	17
his	17
shoulders,	17
placed	17
on	17
his	17
head	17
a	17
montera	17
of	17
green	17
satin	17
that	17
the	17
damsels	17
had	17
given	17
him,	17
and	17
thus	17
arrayed	17
passed	17
out	17
into	17
the	17
large	17
room,	17
where	17
he	17
found	17
the	17
damsels	17
drawn	17
up	17
in	17
double	17
file,	17
the	17
same	17
number	17
on	17
each	17
side,	17
all	17
with	17
the	17
appliances	17
for	17
washing	17
the	17
hands,	17
which	17
they	17
presented	17
to	17
him	17
with	17
profuse	17
obeisances	17
and	17
ceremonies.	17
Then	17
came	17
twelve	17
pages,	17
together	17
with	17
the	17
seneschal,	17
to	17
lead	17
him	17
to	17
dinner,	17
as	17
his	17
hosts	17
were	17
already	17
waiting	17
for	17
him.	17
They	17
placed	17
him	17
in	17
the	17
midst	17
of	17
them,	17
and	17
with	17
much	17
pomp	17
and	17
stateliness	17
they	17
conducted	17
him	17
into	17
another	17
room,	17
where	17
there	17
was	17
a	17
sumptuous	17
table	17
laid	17
with	17
but	17
four	17
covers.	17
The	17
duchess	17
and	17
the	17
duke	17
came	17
out	17
to	17
the	17
door	17
of	17
the	17
room	17
to	17
receive	17
him,	17
and	17
with	17
them	17
a	17
grave	17
ecclesiastic,	17
one	17
of	17
those	17
who	17
rule	17
noblemen’s	17
houses;	17
one	17
of	17
those	17
who,	17
not	17
being	17
born	17
magnates	17
themselves,	17
never	17
know	17
how	17
to	17
teach	17
those	17
who	17
are	17
how	17
to	17
behave	17
as	17
such;	17
one	17
of	17
those	17
who	17
would	17
have	17
the	17
greatness	17
of	17
great	17
folk	17
measured	17
by	17
their	17
own	17
narrowness	17
of	17
mind;	17
one	17
of	17
those	17
who,	17
when	17
they	17
try	17
to	17
introduce	17
economy	17
into	17
the	17
household	17
they	17
rule,	17
lead	17
it	17
into	17
meanness.	17
One	17
of	17
this	17
sort,	17
I	17
say,	17
must	17
have	17
been	17
the	17
grave	17
churchman	17
who	17
came	17
out	17
with	17
the	17
duke	17
and	17
duchess	17
to	17
receive	17
Don	17
Quixote.	17
A	17
vast	17
number	17
of	17
polite	17
speeches	17
were	17
exchanged,	17
and	17
at	17
length,	17
taking	17
Don	17
Quixote	17
between	17
them,	17
they	17
proceeded	17
to	17
sit	17
down	17
to	17
table.	17
The	17
duke	17
pressed	17
Don	17
Quixote	17
to	17
take	17
the	17
head	17
of	17
the	17
table,	17
and,	17
though	17
he	17
refused,	17
the	17
entreaties	17
of	17
the	17
duke	17
were	17
so	17
urgent	17
that	17
he	17
had	17
to	17
accept	17
it.	17
The	17
ecclesiastic	17
took	17
his	17
seat	17
opposite	17
to	17
him,	17
and	17
the	17
duke	17
and	17
duchess	17
those	17
at	17
the	17
sides.	17
All	17
this	17
time	17
Sancho	17
stood	17
by,	17
gaping	17
with	17
amazement	17
at	17
the	17
honour	17
he	17
saw	17
shown	17
to	17
his	17
master	17
by	17
these	17
illustrious	17
persons;	17
and	17
observing	17
all	17
the	17
ceremonious	17
pressing	17
that	17
had	17
passed	17
between	17
the	17
duke	17
and	17
Don	17
Quixote	17
to	17
induce	17
him	17
to	17
take	17
his	17
seat	17
at	17
the	17
head	17
of	17
the	17
table,	17
he	17
said,	17
“If	17
your	17
worship	17
will	17
give	17
me	17
leave	17
I	17
will	17
tell	17
you	17
a	17
story	17
of	17
what	17
happened	17
in	17
my	17
village	17
about	17
this	17
matter	17
of	17
seats.”	17
The	17
moment	17
Sancho	17
said	17
this	17
Don	17
Quixote	17
trembled,	17
making	17
sure	17
that	17
he	17
was	17
about	17
to	17
say	17
something	17
foolish.	17
Sancho	17
glanced	17
at	17
him,	17
and	17
guessing	17
his	17
thoughts,	17
said,	17
“Don’t	17
be	17
afraid	17
of	17
my	17
going	17
astray,	17
señor,	17
or	17
saying	17
anything	17
that	17
won’t	17
be	17
pat	17
to	17
the	17
purpose;	17
I	17
haven’t	17
forgotten	17
the	17
advice	17
your	17
worship	17
gave	17
me	17
just	17
now	17
about	17
talking	17
much	17
or	17
little,	17
well	17
or	17
ill.”	17
“I	17
have	17
no	17
recollection	17
of	17
anything,	17
Sancho,”	17
said	17
Don	17
Quixote;	17
“say	17
what	17
thou	17
wilt,	17
only	17
say	17
it	17
quickly.”	17
“Well	17
then,”	17
said	17
Sancho,	17
“what	17
I	17
am	17
going	17
to	17
say	17
is	17
so	17
true	17
that	17
my	17
master	17
Don	17
Quixote,	17
who	17
is	17
here	17
present,	17
will	17
keep	17
me	17
from	17
lying.”	17
“Lie	17
as	17
much	17
as	17
thou	17
wilt	17
for	17
all	17
I	17
care,	17
Sancho,”	17
said	17
Don	17
Quixote,	17
“for	17
I	17
am	17
not	17
going	17
to	17
stop	17
thee,	17
but	17
consider	17
what	17
thou	17
art	17
going	17
to	17
say.”	17
“I	17
have	17
so	17
considered	17
and	17
reconsidered,”	17
said	17
Sancho,	17
“that	17
the	17
bell-ringer’s	17
in	17
a	17
safe	17
berth;	17
as	17
will	17
be	17
seen	17
by	17
what	17
follows.”	17
“It	17
would	17
be	17
well,”	17
said	17
Don	17
Quixote,	17
“if	17
your	17
highnesses	17
would	17
order	17
them	17
to	17
turn	17
out	17
this	17
idiot,	17
for	17
he	17
will	17
talk	17
a	17
heap	17
of	17
nonsense.”	17
“By	17
the	17
life	17
of	17
the	17
duke,	17
Sancho	17
shall	17
not	17
be	17
taken	17
away	17
from	17
me	17
for	17
a	17
moment,”	17
said	17
the	17
duchess;	17
“I	17
am	17
very	17
fond	17
of	17
him,	17
for	17
I	17
know	17
he	17
is	17
very	17
discreet.”	17
“Discreet	17
be	17
the	17
days	17
of	17
your	17
holiness,”	17
said	17
Sancho,	17
“for	17
the	17
good	17
opinion	17
you	17
have	17
of	17
my	17
wit,	17
though	17
there’s	17
none	17
in	17
me;	17
but	17
the	17
story	17
I	17
want	17
to	17
tell	17
is	17
this.	17
There	17
was	17
an	17
invitation	17
given	17
by	17
a	17
gentleman	17
of	17
my	17
town,	17
a	17
very	17
rich	17
one,	17
and	17
one	17
of	17
quality,	17
for	17
he	17
was	17
one	17
of	17
the	17
Alamos	17
of	17
Medina	17
del	17
Campo,	17
and	17
married	17
to	17
Doña	17
Mencia	17
de	17
Quiñones,	17
the	17
daughter	17
of	17
Don	17
Alonso	17
de	17
Marañon,	17
Knight	17
of	17
the	17
Order	17
of	17
Santiago,	17
that	17
was	17
drowned	17
at	17
the	17
Herradura—him	17
there	17
was	17
that	17
quarrel	17
about	17
years	17
ago	17
in	17
our	17
village,	17
that	17
my	17
master	17
Don	17
Quixote	17
was	17
mixed	17
up	17
in,	17
to	17
the	17
best	17
of	17
my	17
belief,	17
that	17
Tomasillo	17
the	17
scapegrace,	17
the	17
son	17
of	17
Balbastro	17
the	17
smith,	17
was	17
wounded	17
in.—Isn’t	17
all	17
this	17
true,	17
master	17
mine?	17
As	17
you	17
live,	17
say	17
so,	17
that	17
these	17
gentlefolk	17
may	17
not	17
take	17
me	17
for	17
some	17
lying	17
chatterer.”	17
“So	17
far,”	17
said	17
the	17
ecclesiastic,	17
“I	17
take	17
you	17
to	17
be	17
more	17
a	17
chatterer	17
than	17
a	17
liar;	17
but	17
I	17
don’t	17
know	17
what	17
I	17
shall	17
take	17
you	17
for	17
by-and-by.”	17
“Thou	17
citest	17
so	17
many	17
witnesses	17
and	17
proofs,	17
Sancho,”	17
said	17
Don	17
Quixote,	17
“that	17
I	17
have	17
no	17
choice	17
but	17
to	17
say	17
thou	17
must	17
be	17
telling	17
the	17
truth;	17
go	17
on,	17
and	17
cut	17
the	17
story	17
short,	17
for	17
thou	17
art	17
taking	17
the	17
way	17
not	17
to	17
make	17
an	17
end	17
for	17
two	17
days	17
to	17
come.”	17
“He	17
is	17
not	17
to	17
cut	17
it	17
short,”	17
said	17
the	17
duchess;	17
“on	17
the	17
contrary,	17
for	17
my	17
gratification,	17
he	17
is	17
to	17
tell	17
it	17
as	17
he	17
knows	17
it,	17
though	17
he	17
should	17
not	17
finish	17
it	17
these	17
six	17
days;	17
and	17
if	17
he	17
took	17
so	17
many	17
they	17
would	17
be	17
to	17
me	17
the	17
pleasantest	17
I	17
ever	17
spent.”	17
“Well	17
then,	17
sirs,	17
I	17
say,”	17
continued	17
Sancho,	17
“that	17
this	17
same	17
gentleman,	17
whom	17
I	17
know	17
as	17
well	17
as	17
I	17
do	17
my	17
own	17
hands,	17
for	17
it’s	17
not	17
a	17
bowshot	17
from	17
my	17
house	17
to	17
his,	17
invited	17
a	17
poor	17
but	17
respectable	17
labourer—”	17
“Get	17
on,	17
brother,”	17
said	17
the	17
churchman;	17
“at	17
the	17
rate	17
you	17
are	17
going	17
you	17
will	17
not	17
stop	17
with	17
your	17
story	17
short	17
of	17
the	17
next	17
world.”	17
“I’ll	17
stop	17
less	17
than	17
half-way,	17
please	17
God,”	17
said	17
Sancho;	17
“and	17
so	17
I	17
say	17
this	17
labourer,	17
coming	17
to	17
the	17
house	17
of	17
the	17
gentleman	17
I	17
spoke	17
of	17
that	17
invited	17
him—rest	17
his	17
soul,	17
he	17
is	17
now	17
dead;	17
and	17
more	17
by	17
token	17
he	17
died	17
the	17
death	17
of	17
an	17
angel,	17
so	17
they	17
say;	17
for	17
I	17
was	17
not	17
there,	17
for	17
just	17
at	17
that	17
time	17
I	17
had	17
gone	17
to	17
reap	17
at	17
Tembleque—”	17
“As	17
you	17
live,	17
my	17
son,”	17
said	17
the	17
churchman,	17
“make	17
haste	17
back	17
from	17
Tembleque,	17
and	17
finish	17
your	17
story	17
without	17
burying	17
the	17
gentleman,	17
unless	17
you	17
want	17
to	17
make	17
more	17
funerals.”	17
“Well	17
then,	17
it	17
so	17
happened,”	17
said	17
Sancho,	17
“that	17
as	17
the	17
pair	17
of	17
them	17
were	17
going	17
to	17
sit	17
down	17
to	17
table—and	17
I	17
think	17
I	17
can	17
see	17
them	17
now	17
plainer	17
than	17
ever—”	17
Great	17
was	17
the	17
enjoyment	17
the	17
duke	17
and	17
duchess	17
derived	17
from	17
the	17
irritation	17
the	17
worthy	17
churchman	17
showed	17
at	17
the	17
long-winded,	17
halting	17
way	17
Sancho	17
had	17
of	17
telling	17
his	17
story,	17
while	17
Don	17
Quixote	17
was	17
chafing	17
with	17
rage	17
and	17
vexation.	17
“So,	17
as	17
I	17
was	17
saying,”	17
continued	17
Sancho,	17
“as	17
the	17
pair	17
of	17
them	17
were	17
going	17
to	17
sit	17
down	17
to	17
table,	17
as	17
I	17
said,	17
the	17
labourer	17
insisted	17
upon	17
the	17
gentleman’s	17
taking	17
the	17
head	17
of	17
the	17
table,	17
and	17
the	17
gentleman	17
insisted	17
upon	17
the	17
labourer’s	17
taking	17
it,	17
as	17
his	17
orders	17
should	17
be	17
obeyed	17
in	17
his	17
house;	17
but	17
the	17
labourer,	17
who	17
plumed	17
himself	17
on	17
his	17
politeness	17
and	17
good	17
breeding,	17
would	17
not	17
on	17
any	17
account,	17
until	17
the	17
gentleman,	17
out	17
of	17
patience,	17
putting	17
his	17
hands	17
on	17
his	17
shoulders,	17
compelled	17
him	17
by	17
force	17
to	17
sit	17
down,	17
saying,	17
‘Sit	17
down,	17
you	17
stupid	17
lout,	17
for	17
wherever	17
I	17
sit	17
will	17
be	17
the	17
head	17
to	17
you;	17
and	17
that’s	17
the	17
story,	17
and,	17
troth,	17
I	17
think	17
it	17
hasn’t	17
been	17
brought	17
in	17
amiss	17
here.”	17
Don	17
Quixote	17
turned	17
all	17
colours,	17
which,	17
on	17
his	17
sunburnt	17
face,	17
mottled	17
it	17
till	17
it	17
looked	17
like	17
jasper.	17
The	17
duke	17
and	17
duchess	17
suppressed	17
their	17
laughter	17
so	17
as	17
not	17
altogether	17
to	17
mortify	17
Don	17
Quixote,	17
for	17
they	17
saw	17
through	17
Sancho’s	17
impertinence;	17
and	17
to	17
change	17
the	17
conversation,	17
and	17
keep	17
Sancho	17
from	17
uttering	17
more	17
absurdities,	17
the	17
duchess	17
asked	17
Don	17
Quixote	17
what	17
news	17
he	17
had	17
of	17
the	17
lady	17
Dulcinea,	17
and	17
if	17
he	17
had	17
sent	17
her	17
any	17
presents	17
of	17
giants	17
or	17
miscreants	17
lately,	17
for	17
he	17
could	17
not	17
but	17
have	17
vanquished	17
a	17
good	17
many.	17
To	17
which	17
Don	17
Quixote	17
replied,	17
“Señora,	17
my	17
misfortunes,	17
though	17
they	17
had	17
a	17
beginning,	17
will	17
never	17
have	17
an	17
end.	17
I	17
have	17
vanquished	17
giants	17
and	17
I	17
have	17
sent	17
her	17
caitiffs	17
and	17
miscreants;	17
but	17
where	17
are	17
they	17
to	17
find	17
her	17
if	17
she	17
is	17
enchanted	17
and	17
turned	17
into	17
the	17
most	17
ill-favoured	17
peasant	17
wench	17
that	17
can	17
be	17
imagined?”	17
“I	17
don’t	17
know,”	17
said	17
Sancho	17
Panza;	17
“to	17
me	17
she	17
seems	17
the	17
fairest	17
creature	17
in	17
the	17
world;	17
at	17
any	17
rate,	17
in	17
nimbleness	17
and	17
jumping	17
she	17
won’t	17
give	17
in	17
to	17
a	17
tumbler;	17
by	17
my	17
faith,	17
señora	17
duchess,	17
she	17
leaps	17
from	17
the	17
ground	17
on	17
to	17
the	17
back	17
of	17
an	17
ass	17
like	17
a	17
cat.”	17
“Have	17
you	17
seen	17
her	17
enchanted,	17
Sancho?”	17
asked	17
the	17
duke.	17
“What,	17
seen	17
her!”	17
said	17
Sancho;	17
“why,	17
who	17
the	17
devil	17
was	17
it	17
but	17
myself	17
that	17
first	17
thought	17
of	17
the	17
enchantment	17
business?	17
She	17
is	17
as	17
much	17
enchanted	17
as	17
my	17
father.”	17
The	17
ecclesiastic,	17
when	17
he	17
heard	17
them	17
talking	17
of	17
giants	17
and	17
caitiffs	17
and	17
enchantments,	17
began	17
to	17
suspect	17
that	17
this	17
must	17
be	17
Don	17
Quixote	17
of	17
La	17
Mancha,	17
whose	17
story	17
the	17
duke	17
was	17
always	17
reading;	17
and	17
he	17
had	17
himself	17
often	17
reproved	17
him	17
for	17
it,	17
telling	17
him	17
it	17
was	17
foolish	17
to	17
read	17
such	17
fooleries;	17
and	17
becoming	17
convinced	17
that	17
his	17
suspicion	17
was	17
correct,	17
addressing	17
the	17
duke,	17
he	17
said	17
very	17
angrily	17
to	17
him,	17
“Señor,	17
your	17
excellence	17
will	17
have	17
to	17
give	17
account	17
to	17
God	17
for	17
what	17
this	17
good	17
man	17
does.	17
This	17
Don	17
Quixote,	17
or	17
Don	17
Simpleton,	17
or	17
whatever	17
his	17
name	17
is,	17
cannot,	17
I	17
imagine,	17
be	17
such	17
a	17
blockhead	17
as	17
your	17
excellence	17
would	17
have	17
him,	17
holding	17
out	17
encouragement	17
to	17
him	17
to	17
go	17
on	17
with	17
his	17
vagaries	17
and	17
follies.”	17
Then	17
turning	17
to	17
address	17
Don	17
Quixote	17
he	17
said,	17
“And	17
you,	17
num-skull,	17
who	17
put	17
it	17
into	17
your	17
head	17
that	17
you	17
are	17
a	17
knight-errant,	17
and	17
vanquish	17
giants	17
and	17
capture	17
miscreants?	17
Go	17
your	17
ways	17
in	17
a	17
good	17
hour,	17
and	17
in	17
a	17
good	17
hour	17
be	17
it	17
said	17
to	17
you.	17
Go	17
home	17
and	17
bring	17
up	17
your	17
children	17
if	17
you	17
have	17
any,	17
and	17
attend	17
to	17
your	17
business,	17
and	17
give	17
over	17
going	17
wandering	17
about	17
the	17
world,	17
gaping	17
and	17
making	17
a	17
laughing-stock	17
of	17
yourself	17
to	17
all	17
who	17
know	17
you	17
and	17
all	17
who	17
don’t.	17
Where,	17
in	17
heaven’s	17
name,	17
have	17
you	17
discovered	17
that	17
there	17
are	17
or	17
ever	17
were	17
knights-errant?	17
Where	17
are	17
there	17
giants	17
in	17
Spain	17
or	17
miscreants	17
in	17
La	17
Mancha,	17
or	17
enchanted	17
Dulcineas,	17
or	17
all	17
the	17
rest	17
of	17
the	17
silly	17
things	17
they	17
tell	17
about	17
you?”	17
Don	17
Quixote	17
listened	17
attentively	17
to	17
the	17
reverend	17
gentleman’s	17
words,	17
and	17
as	17
soon	17
as	17
he	17
perceived	17
he	17
had	17
done	17
speaking,	17
regardless	17
of	17
the	17
presence	17
of	17
the	17
duke	17
and	17
duchess,	17
he	17
sprang	17
to	17
his	17
feet	17
with	17
angry	17
looks	17
and	17
an	17
agitated	17
countenance,	17
and	17
said—But	17
the	17
reply	17
deserves	17
a	17
chapter	17
to	17
itself.	17

Don	17
Quixote,	17
then,	17
having	17
risen	17
to	17
his	17
feet,	17
trembling	17
from	17
head	17
to	17
foot	17
like	17
a	17
man	17
dosed	17
with	17
mercury,	17
said	17
in	17
a	17
hurried,	17
agitated	17
voice,	17
“The	17
place	17
I	17
am	17
in,	17
the	17
presence	17
in	17
which	17
I	17
stand,	17
and	17
the	17
respect	17
I	17
have	17
and	17
always	17
have	17
had	17
for	17
the	17
profession	17
to	17
which	17
your	17
worship	17
belongs,	17
hold	17
and	17
bind	17
the	17
hands	17
of	17
my	17
just	17
indignation;	17
and	17
as	17
well	17
for	17
these	17
reasons	17
as	17
because	17
I	17
know,	17
as	17
everyone	17
knows,	17
that	17
a	17
gownsman’s	17
weapon	17
is	17
the	17
same	17
as	17
a	17
woman’s,	17
the	17
tongue,	17
I	17
will	17
with	17
mine	17
engage	17
in	17
equal	17
combat	17
with	17
your	17
worship,	17
from	17
whom	17
one	17
might	17
have	17
expected	17
good	17
advice	17
instead	17
of	17
foul	17
abuse.	17
Pious,	17
well-meant	17
reproof	17
requires	17
a	17
different	17
demeanour	17
and	17
arguments	17
of	17
another	17
sort;	17
at	17
any	17
rate,	17
to	17
have	17
reproved	17
me	17
in	17
public,	17
and	17
so	17
roughly,	17
exceeds	17
the	17
bounds	17
of	17
proper	17
reproof,	17
for	17
that	17
comes	17
better	17
with	17
gentleness	17
than	17
with	17
rudeness;	17
and	17
it	17
is	17
not	17
seemly	17
to	17
call	17
the	17
sinner	17
roundly	17
blockhead	17
and	17
booby,	17
without	17
knowing	17
anything	17
of	17
the	17
sin	17
that	17
is	17
reproved.	17
Come,	17
tell	17
me,	17
for	17
which	17
of	17
the	17
stupidities	17
you	17
have	17
observed	17
in	17
me	17
do	17
you	17
condemn	17
and	17
abuse	17
me,	17
and	17
bid	17
me	17
go	17
home	17
and	17
look	17
after	17
my	17
house	17
and	17
wife	17
and	17
children,	17
without	17
knowing	17
whether	17
I	17
have	17
any?	17
Is	17
nothing	17
more	17
needed	17
than	17
to	17
get	17
a	17
footing,	17
by	17
hook	17
or	17
by	17
crook,	17
in	17
other	17
people’s	17
houses	17
to	17
rule	17
over	17
the	17
masters	17
(and	17
that,	17
perhaps,	17
after	17
having	17
been	17
brought	17
up	17
in	17
all	17
the	17
straitness	17
of	17
some	17
seminary,	17
and	17
without	17
having	17
ever	17
seen	17
more	17
of	17
the	17
world	17
than	17
may	17
lie	17
within	17
twenty	17
or	17
thirty	17
leagues	17
round),	17
to	17
fit	17
one	17
to	17
lay	17
down	17
the	17
law	17
rashly	17
for	17
chivalry,	17
and	17
pass	17
judgment	17
on	17
knights-errant?	17
Is	17
it,	17
haply,	17
an	17
idle	17
occupation,	17
or	17
is	17
the	17
time	17
ill-spent	17
that	17
is	17
spent	17
in	17
roaming	17
the	17
world	17
in	17
quest,	17
not	17
of	17
its	17
enjoyments,	17
but	17
of	17
those	17
arduous	17
toils	17
whereby	17
the	17
good	17
mount	17
upwards	17
to	17
the	17
abodes	17
of	17
everlasting	17
life?	17
If	17
gentlemen,	17
great	17
lords,	17
nobles,	17
men	17
of	17
high	17
birth,	17
were	17
to	17
rate	17
me	17
as	17
a	17
fool	17
I	17
should	17
take	17
it	17
as	17
an	17
irreparable	17
insult;	17
but	17
I	17
care	17
not	17
a	17
farthing	17
if	17
clerks	17
who	17
have	17
never	17
entered	17
upon	17
or	17
trod	17
the	17
paths	17
of	17
chivalry	17
should	17
think	17
me	17
foolish.	17
Knight	17
I	17
am,	17
and	17
knight	17
I	17
will	17
die,	17
if	17
such	17
be	17
the	17
pleasure	17
of	17
the	17
Most	17
High.	17
Some	17
take	17
the	17
broad	17
road	17
of	17
overweening	17
ambition;	17
others	17
that	17
of	17
mean	17
and	17
servile	17
flattery;	17
others	17
that	17
of	17
deceitful	17
hypocrisy,	17
and	17
some	17
that	17
of	17
true	17
religion;	17
but	17
I,	17
led	17
by	17
my	17
star,	17
follow	17
the	17
narrow	17
path	17
of	17
knight-errantry,	17
and	17
in	17
pursuit	17
of	17
that	17
calling	17
I	17
despise	17
wealth,	17
but	17
not	17
honour.	17
I	17
have	17
redressed	17
injuries,	17
righted	17
wrongs,	17
punished	17
insolences,	17
vanquished	17
giants,	17
and	17
crushed	17
monsters;	17
I	17
am	17
in	17
love,	17
for	17
no	17
other	17
reason	17
than	17
that	17
it	17
is	17
incumbent	17
on	17
knights-errant	17
to	17
be	17
so;	17
but	17
though	17
I	17
am,	17
I	17
am	17
no	17
carnal-minded	17
lover,	17
but	17
one	17
of	17
the	17
chaste,	17
platonic	17
sort.	17
My	17
intentions	17
are	17
always	17
directed	17
to	17
worthy	17
ends,	17
to	17
do	17
good	17
to	17
all	17
and	17
evil	17
to	17
none;	17
and	17
if	17
he	17
who	17
means	17
this,	17
does	17
this,	17
and	17
makes	17
this	17
his	17
practice	17
deserves	17
to	17
be	17
called	17
a	17
fool,	17
it	17
is	17
for	17
your	17
highnesses	17
to	17
say,	17
O	17
most	17
excellent	17
duke	17
and	17
duchess.”	17
“Good,	17
by	17
God!”	17
cried	17
Sancho;	17
“say	17
no	17
more	17
in	17
your	17
own	17
defence,	17
master	17
mine,	17
for	17
there’s	17
nothing	17
more	17
in	17
the	17
world	17
to	17
be	17
said,	17
thought,	17
or	17
insisted	17
on;	17
and	17
besides,	17
when	17
this	17
gentleman	17
denies,	17
as	17
he	17
has,	17
that	17
there	17
are	17
or	17
ever	17
have	17
been	17
any	17
knights-errant	17
in	17
the	17
world,	17
is	17
it	17
any	17
wonder	17
if	17
he	17
knows	17
nothing	17
of	17
what	17
he	17
has	17
been	17
talking	17
about?”	17
“Perhaps,	17
brother,”	17
said	17
the	17
ecclesiastic,	17
“you	17
are	17
that	17
Sancho	17
Panza	17
that	17
is	17
mentioned,	17
to	17
whom	17
your	17
master	17
has	17
promised	17
an	17
island?”	17
“Yes,	17
I	17
am,”	17
said	17
Sancho,	17
“and	17
what’s	17
more,	17
I	17
am	17
one	17
who	17
deserves	17
it	17
as	17
much	17
as	17
anyone;	17
I	17
am	17
one	17
of	17
the	17
sort—‘Attach	17
thyself	17
to	17
the	17
good,	17
and	17
thou	17
wilt	17
be	17
one	17
of	17
them,’	17
and	17
of	17
those,	17
‘Not	17
with	17
whom	17
thou	17
art	17
bred,	17
but	17
with	17
whom	17
thou	17
art	17
fed,’	17
and	17
of	17
those,	17
‘Who	17
leans	17
against	17
a	17
good	17
tree,	17
a	17
good	17
shade	17
covers	17
him;’	17
I	17
have	17
leant	17
upon	17
a	17
good	17
master,	17
and	17
I	17
have	17
been	17
for	17
months	17
going	17
about	17
with	17
him,	17
and	17
please	17
God	17
I	17
shall	17
be	17
just	17
such	17
another;	17
long	17
life	17
to	17
him	17
and	17
long	17
life	17
to	17
me,	17
for	17
neither	17
will	17
he	17
be	17
in	17
any	17
want	17
of	17
empires	17
to	17
rule,	17
or	17
I	17
of	17
islands	17
to	17
govern.”	17
“No,	17
Sancho	17
my	17
friend,	17
certainly	17
not,”	17
said	17
the	17
duke,	17
“for	17
in	17
the	17
name	17
of	17
Señor	17
Don	17
Quixote	17
I	17
confer	17
upon	17
you	17
the	17
government	17
of	17
one	17
of	17
no	17
small	17
importance	17
that	17
I	17
have	17
at	17
my	17
disposal.”	17
“Go	17
down	17
on	17
thy	17
knees,	17
Sancho,”	17
said	17
Don	17
Quixote,	17
“and	17
kiss	17
the	17
feet	17
of	17
his	17
excellence	17
for	17
the	17
favour	17
he	17
has	17
bestowed	17
upon	17
thee.”	17
Sancho	17
obeyed,	17
and	17
on	17
seeing	17
this	17
the	17
ecclesiastic	17
stood	17
up	17
from	17
table	17
completely	17
out	17
of	17
temper,	17
exclaiming,	17
“By	17
the	17
gown	17
I	17
wear,	17
I	17
am	17
almost	17
inclined	17
to	17
say	17
that	17
your	17
excellence	17
is	17
as	17
great	17
a	17
fool	17
as	17
these	17
sinners.	17
No	17
wonder	17
they	17
are	17
mad,	17
when	17
people	17
who	17
are	17
in	17
their	17
senses	17
sanction	17
their	17
madness!	17
I	17
leave	17
your	17
excellence	17
with	17
them,	17
for	17
so	17
long	17
as	17
they	17
are	17
in	17
the	17
house,	17
I	17
will	17
remain	17
in	17
my	17
own,	17
and	17
spare	17
myself	17
the	17
trouble	17
of	17
reproving	17
what	17
I	17
cannot	17
remedy;”	17
and	17
without	17
uttering	17
another	17
word,	17
or	17
eating	17
another	17
morsel,	17
he	17
went	17
off,	17
the	17
entreaties	17
of	17
the	17
duke	17
and	17
duchess	17
being	17
entirely	17
unavailing	17
to	17
stop	17
him;	17
not	17
that	17
the	17
duke	17
said	17
much	17
to	17
him,	17
for	17
he	17
could	17
not,	17
because	17
of	17
the	17
laughter	17
his	17
uncalled-for	17
anger	17
provoked.	17
When	17
he	17
had	17
done	17
laughing,	17
he	17
said	17
to	17
Don	17
Quixote,	17
“You	17
have	17
replied	17
on	17
your	17
own	17
behalf	17
so	17
stoutly,	17
Sir	17
Knight	17
of	17
the	17
Lions,	17
that	17
there	17
is	17
no	17
occasion	17
to	17
seek	17
further	17
satisfaction	17
for	17
this,	17
which,	17
though	17
it	17
may	17
look	17
like	17
an	17
offence,	17
is	17
not	17
so	17
at	17
all,	17
for,	17
as	17
women	17
can	17
give	17
no	17
offence,	17
no	17
more	17
can	17
ecclesiastics,	17
as	17
you	17
very	17
well	17
know.”	17
“That	17
is	17
true,”	17
said	17
Don	17
Quixote,	17
“and	17
the	17
reason	17
is,	17
that	17
he	17
who	17
is	17
not	17
liable	17
to	17
offence	17
cannot	17
give	17
offence	17
to	17
anyone.	17
Women,	17
children,	17
and	17
ecclesiastics,	17
as	17
they	17
cannot	17
defend	17
themselves,	17
though	17
they	17
may	17
receive	17
offence	17
cannot	17
be	17
insulted,	17
because	17
between	17
the	17
offence	17
and	17
the	17
insult	17
there	17
is,	17
as	17
your	17
excellence	17
very	17
well	17
knows,	17
this	17
difference:	17
the	17
insult	17
comes	17
from	17
one	17
who	17
is	17
capable	17
of	17
offering	17
it,	17
and	17
does	17
so,	17
and	17
maintains	17
it;	17
the	17
offence	17
may	17
come	17
from	17
any	17
quarter	17
without	17
carrying	17
insult.	17
To	17
take	17
an	17
example:	17
a	17
man	17
is	17
standing	17
unsuspectingly	17
in	17
the	17
street	17
and	17
ten	17
others	17
come	17
up	17
armed	17
and	17
beat	17
him;	17
he	17
draws	17
his	17
sword	17
and	17
quits	17
himself	17
like	17
a	17
man,	17
but	17
the	17
number	17
of	17
his	17
antagonists	17
makes	17
it	17
impossible	17
for	17
him	17
to	17
effect	17
his	17
purpose	17
and	17
avenge	17
himself;	17
this	17
man	17
suffers	17
an	17
offence	17
but	17
not	17
an	17
insult.	17
Another	17
example	17
will	17
make	17
the	17
same	17
thing	17
plain:	17
a	17
man	17
is	17
standing	17
with	17
his	17
back	17
turned,	17
another	17
comes	17
up	17
and	17
strikes	17
him,	17
and	17
after	17
striking	17
him	17
takes	17
to	17
flight,	17
without	17
waiting	17
an	17
instant,	17
and	17
the	17
other	17
pursues	17
him	17
but	17
does	17
not	17
overtake	17
him;	17
he	17
who	17
received	17
the	17
blow	17
received	17
an	17
offence,	17
but	17
not	17
an	17
insult,	17
because	17
an	17
insult	17
must	17
be	17
maintained.	17
If	17
he	17
who	17
struck	17
him,	17
though	17
he	17
did	17
so	17
sneakingly	17
and	17
treacherously,	17
had	17
drawn	17
his	17
sword	17
and	17
stood	17
and	17
faced	17
him,	17
then	17
he	17
who	17
had	17
been	17
struck	17
would	17
have	17
received	17
offence	17
and	17
insult	17
at	17
the	17
same	17
time;	17
offence	17
because	17
he	17
was	17
struck	17
treacherously,	17
insult	17
because	17
he	17
who	17
struck	17
him	17
maintained	17
what	17
he	17
had	17
done,	17
standing	17
his	17
ground	17
without	17
taking	17
to	17
flight.	17
And	17
so,	17
according	17
to	17
the	17
laws	17
of	17
the	17
accursed	17
duel,	17
I	17
may	17
have	17
received	17
offence,	17
but	17
not	17
insult,	17
for	17
neither	17
women	17
nor	17
children	17
can	17
maintain	17
it,	17
nor	17
can	17
they	17
wound,	17
nor	17
have	17
they	17
any	17
way	17
of	17
standing	17
their	17
ground,	17
and	17
it	17
is	17
just	17
the	17
same	17
with	17
those	17
connected	17
with	17
religion;	17
for	17
these	17
three	17
sorts	17
of	17
persons	17
are	17
without	17
arms	17
offensive	17
or	17
defensive,	17
and	17
so,	17
though	17
naturally	17
they	17
are	17
bound	17
to	17
defend	17
themselves,	17
they	17
have	17
no	17
right	17
to	17
offend	17
anybody;	17
and	17
though	17
I	17
said	17
just	17
now	17
I	17
might	17
have	17
received	17
offence,	17
I	17
say	17
now	17
certainly	17
not,	17
for	17
he	17
who	17
cannot	17
receive	17
an	17
insult	17
can	17
still	17
less	17
give	17
one;	17
for	17
which	17
reasons	17
I	17
ought	17
not	17
to	17
feel,	17
nor	17
do	17
I	17
feel,	17
aggrieved	17
at	17
what	17
that	17
good	17
man	17
said	17
to	17
me;	17
I	17
only	17
wish	17
he	17
had	17
stayed	17
a	17
little	17
longer,	17
that	17
I	17
might	17
have	17
shown	17
him	17
the	17
mistake	17
he	17
makes	17
in	17
supposing	17
and	17
maintaining	17
that	17
there	17
are	17
not	17
and	17
never	17
have	17
been	17
any	17
knights-errant	17
in	17
the	17
world;	17
had	17
Amadis	17
or	17
any	17
of	17
his	17
countless	17
descendants	17
heard	17
him	17
say	17
as	17
much,	17
I	17
am	17
sure	17
it	17
would	17
not	17
have	17
gone	17
well	17
with	17
his	17
worship.”	17
“I	17
will	17
take	17
my	17
oath	17
of	17
that,”	17
said	17
Sancho;	17
“they	17
would	17
have	17
given	17
him	17
a	17
slash	17
that	17
would	17
have	17
slit	17
him	17
down	17
from	17
top	17
to	17
toe	17
like	17
a	17
pomegranate	17
or	17
a	17
ripe	17
melon;	17
they	17
were	17
likely	17
fellows	17
to	17
put	17
up	17
with	17
jokes	17
of	17
that	17
sort!	17
By	17
my	17
faith,	17
I’m	17
certain	17
if	17
Reinaldos	17
of	17
Montalvan	17
had	17
heard	17
the	17
little	17
man’s	17
words	17
he	17
would	17
have	17
given	17
him	17
such	17
a	17
spank	17
on	17
the	17
mouth	17
that	17
he	17
wouldn’t	17
have	17
spoken	17
for	17
the	17
next	17
three	17
years;	17
ay,	17
let	17
him	17
tackle	17
them,	17
and	17
he’ll	17
see	17
how	17
he’ll	17
get	17
out	17
of	17
their	17
hands!”	17
The	17
duchess,	17
as	17
she	17
listened	17
to	17
Sancho,	17
was	17
ready	17
to	17
die	17
with	17
laughter,	17
and	17
in	17
her	17
own	17
mind	17
she	17
set	17
him	17
down	17
as	17
droller	17
and	17
madder	17
than	17
his	17
master;	17
and	17
there	17
were	17
a	17
good	17
many	17
just	17
then	17
who	17
were	17
of	17
the	17
same	17
opinion.	17
Don	17
Quixote	17
finally	17
grew	17
calm,	17
and	17
dinner	17
came	17
to	17
an	17
end,	17
and	17
as	17
the	17
cloth	17
was	17
removed	17
four	17
damsels	17
came	17
in,	17
one	17
of	17
them	17
with	17
a	17
silver	17
basin,	17
another	17
with	17
a	17
jug	17
also	17
of	17
silver,	17
a	17
third	17
with	17
two	17
fine	17
white	17
towels	17
on	17
her	17
shoulder,	17
and	17
the	17
fourth	17
with	17
her	17
arms	17
bared	17
to	17
the	17
elbows,	17
and	17
in	17
her	17
white	17
hands	17
(for	17
white	17
they	17
certainly	17
were)	17
a	17
round	17
ball	17
of	17
Naples	17
soap.	17
The	17
one	17
with	17
the	17
basin	17
approached,	17
and	17
with	17
arch	17
composure	17
and	17
impudence,	17
thrust	17
it	17
under	17
Don	17
Quixote’s	17
chin,	17
who,	17
wondering	17
at	17
such	17
a	17
ceremony,	17
said	17
never	17
a	17
word,	17
supposing	17
it	17
to	17
be	17
the	17
custom	17
of	17
that	17
country	17
to	17
wash	17
beards	17
instead	17
of	17
hands;	17
he	17
therefore	17
stretched	17
his	17
out	17
as	17
far	17
as	17
he	17
could,	17
and	17
at	17
the	17
same	17
instant	17
the	17
jug	17
began	17
to	17
pour	17
and	17
the	17
damsel	17
with	17
the	17
soap	17
rubbed	17
his	17
beard	17
briskly,	17
raising	17
snow-flakes,	17
for	17
the	17
soap	17
lather	17
was	17
no	17
less	17
white,	17
not	17
only	17
over	17
the	17
beard,	17
but	17
all	17
over	17
the	17
face,	17
and	17
over	17
the	17
eyes	17
of	17
the	17
submissive	17
knight,	17
so	17
that	17
they	17
were	17
perforce	17
obliged	17
to	17
keep	17
shut.	17
The	17
duke	17
and	17
duchess,	17
who	17
had	17
not	17
known	17
anything	17
about	17
this,	17
waited	17
to	17
see	17
what	17
came	17
of	17
this	17
strange	17
washing.	17
The	17
barber	17
damsel,	17
when	17
she	17
had	17
him	17
a	17
hand’s	17
breadth	17
deep	17
in	17
lather,	17
pretended	17
that	17
there	17
was	17
no	17
more	17
water,	17
and	17
bade	17
the	17
one	17
with	17
the	17
jug	17
go	17
and	17
fetch	17
some,	17
while	17
Señor	17
Don	17
Quixote	17
waited.	17
She	17
did	17
so,	17
and	17
Don	17
Quixote	17
was	17
left	17
the	17
strangest	17
and	17
most	17
ludicrous	17
figure	17
that	17
could	17
be	17
imagined.	17
All	17
those	17
present,	17
and	17
there	17
were	17
a	17
good	17
many,	17
were	17
watching	17
him,	17
and	17
as	17
they	17
saw	17
him	17
there	17
with	17
half	17
a	17
yard	17
of	17
neck,	17
and	17
that	17
uncommonly	17
brown,	17
his	17
eyes	17
shut,	17
and	17
his	17
beard	17
full	17
of	17
soap,	17
it	17
was	17
a	17
great	17
wonder,	17
and	17
only	17
by	17
great	17
discretion,	17
that	17
they	17
were	17
able	17
to	17
restrain	17
their	17
laughter.	17
The	17
damsels,	17
the	17
concocters	17
of	17
the	17
joke,	17
kept	17
their	17
eyes	17
down,	17
not	17
daring	17
to	17
look	17
at	17
their	17
master	17
and	17
mistress;	17
and	17
as	17
for	17
them,	17
laughter	17
and	17
anger	17
struggled	17
within	17
them,	17
and	17
they	17
knew	17
not	17
what	17
to	17
do,	17
whether	17
to	17
punish	17
the	17
audacity	17
of	17
the	17
girls,	17
or	17
to	17
reward	17
them	17
for	17
the	17
amusement	17
they	17
had	17
received	17
from	17
seeing	17
Don	17
Quixote	17
in	17
such	17
a	17
plight.	17
At	17
length	17
the	17
damsel	17
with	17
the	17
jug	17
returned	17
and	17
they	17
made	17
an	17
end	17
of	17
washing	17
Don	17
Quixote,	17
and	17
the	17
one	17
who	17
carried	17
the	17
towels	17
very	17
deliberately	17
wiped	17
him	17
and	17
dried	17
him;	17
and	17
all	17
four	17
together	17
making	17
him	17
a	17
profound	17
obeisance	17
and	17
curtsey,	17
they	17
were	17
about	17
to	17
go,	17
when	17
the	17
duke,	17
lest	17
Don	17
Quixote	17
should	17
see	17
through	17
the	17
joke,	17
called	17
out	17
to	17
the	17
one	17
with	17
the	17
basin	17
saying,	17
“Come	17
and	17
wash	17
me,	17
and	17
take	17
care	17
that	17
there	17
is	17
water	17
enough.”	17
The	17
girl,	17
sharp-witted	17
and	17
prompt,	17
came	17
and	17
placed	17
the	17
basin	17
for	17
the	17
duke	17
as	17
she	17
had	17
done	17
for	17
Don	17
Quixote,	17
and	17
they	17
soon	17
had	17
him	17
well	17
soaped	17
and	17
washed,	17
and	17
having	17
wiped	17
him	17
dry	17
they	17
made	17
their	17
obeisance	17
and	17
retired.	17
It	17
appeared	17
afterwards	17
that	17
the	17
duke	17
had	17
sworn	17
that	17
if	17
they	17
had	17
not	17
washed	17
him	17
as	17
they	17
had	17
Don	17
Quixote	17
he	17
would	17
have	17
punished	17
them	17
for	17
their	17
impudence,	17
which	17
they	17
adroitly	17
atoned	17
for	17
by	17
soaping	17
him	17
as	17
well.	17
Sancho	17
observed	17
the	17
ceremony	17
of	17
the	17
washing	17
very	17
attentively,	17
and	17
said	17
to	17
himself,	17
“God	17
bless	17
me,	17
if	17
it	17
were	17
only	17
the	17
custom	17
in	17
this	17
country	17
to	17
wash	17
squires’	17
beards	17
too	17
as	17
well	17
as	17
knights’.	17
For	17
by	17
God	17
and	17
upon	17
my	17
soul	17
I	17
want	17
it	17
badly;	17
and	17
if	17
they	17
gave	17
me	17
a	17
scrape	17
of	17
the	17
razor	17
besides	17
I’d	17
take	17
it	17
as	17
a	17
still	17
greater	17
kindness.”	17
“What	17
are	17
you	17
saying	17
to	17
yourself,	17
Sancho?”	17
asked	17
the	17
duchess.	17
“I	17
was	17
saying,	17
señora,”	17
he	17
replied,	17
“that	17
in	17
the	17
courts	17
of	17
other	17
princes,	17
when	17
the	17
cloth	17
is	17
taken	17
away,	17
I	17
have	17
always	17
heard	17
say	17
they	17
give	17
water	17
for	17
the	17
hands,	17
but	17
not	17
lye	17
for	17
the	17
beard;	17
and	17
that	17
shows	17
it	17
is	17
good	17
to	17
live	17
long	17
that	17
you	17
may	17
see	17
much;	17
to	17
be	17
sure,	17
they	17
say	17
too	17
that	17
he	17
who	17
lives	17
a	17
long	17
life	17
must	17
undergo	17
much	17
evil,	17
though	17
to	17
undergo	17
a	17
washing	17
of	17
that	17
sort	17
is	17
pleasure	17
rather	17
than	17
pain.”	17
“Don’t	17
be	17
uneasy,	17
friend	17
Sancho,”	17
said	17
the	17
duchess;	17
“I	17
will	17
take	17
care	17
that	17
my	17
damsels	17
wash	17
you,	17
and	17
even	17
put	17
you	17
in	17
the	17
tub	17
if	17
necessary.”	17
“I’ll	17
be	17
content	17
with	17
the	17
beard,”	17
said	17
Sancho,	17
“at	17
any	17
rate	17
for	17
the	17
present;	17
and	17
as	17
for	17
the	17
future,	17
God	17
has	17
decreed	17
what	17
is	17
to	17
be.”	17
“Attend	17
to	17
worthy	17
Sancho’s	17
request,	17
seneschal,”	17
said	17
the	17
duchess,	17
“and	17
do	17
exactly	17
what	17
he	17
wishes.”	17
The	17
seneschal	17
replied	17
that	17
Señor	17
Sancho	17
should	17
be	17
obeyed	17
in	17
everything;	17
and	17
with	17
that	17
he	17
went	17
away	17
to	17
dinner	17
and	17
took	17
Sancho	17
along	17
with	17
him,	17
while	17
the	17
duke	17
and	17
duchess	17
and	17
Don	17
Quixote	17
remained	17
at	17
table	17
discussing	17
a	17
great	17
variety	17
of	17
things,	17
but	17
all	17
bearing	17
on	17
the	17
calling	17
of	17
arms	17
and	17
knight-errantry.	17
The	17
duchess	17
begged	17
Don	17
Quixote,	17
as	17
he	17
seemed	17
to	17
have	17
a	17
retentive	17
memory,	17
to	17
describe	17
and	17
portray	17
to	17
her	17
the	17
beauty	17
and	17
features	17
of	17
the	17
lady	17
Dulcinea	17
del	17
Toboso,	17
for,	17
judging	17
by	17
what	17
fame	17
trumpeted	17
abroad	17
of	17
her	17
beauty,	17
she	17
felt	17
sure	17
she	17
must	17
be	17
the	17
fairest	17
creature	17
in	17
the	17
world,	17
nay,	17
in	17
all	17
La	17
Mancha.	17
Don	17
Quixote	17
sighed	17
on	17
hearing	17
the	17
duchess’s	17
request,	17
and	17
said,	17
“If	17
I	17
could	17
pluck	17
out	17
my	17
heart,	17
and	17
lay	17
it	17
on	17
a	17
plate	17
on	17
this	17
table	17
here	17
before	17
your	17
highness’s	17
eyes,	17
it	17
would	17
spare	17
my	17
tongue	17
the	17
pain	17
of	17
telling	17
what	17
can	17
hardly	17
be	17
thought	17
of,	17
for	17
in	17
it	17
your	17
excellence	17
would	17
see	17
her	17
portrayed	17
in	17
full.	17
But	17
why	17
should	17
I	17
attempt	17
to	17
depict	17
and	17
describe	17
in	17
detail,	17
and	17
feature	17
by	17
feature,	17
the	17
beauty	17
of	17
the	17
peerless	17
Dulcinea,	17
the	17
burden	17
being	17
one	17
worthy	17
of	17
other	17
shoulders	17
than	17
mine,	17
an	17
enterprise	17
wherein	17
the	17
pencils	17
of	17
Parrhasius,	17
Timantes,	17
and	17
Apelles,	17
and	17
the	17
graver	17
of	17
Lysippus	17
ought	17
to	17
be	17
employed,	17
to	17
paint	17
it	17
in	17
pictures	17
and	17
carve	17
it	17
in	17
marble	17
and	17
bronze,	17
and	17
Ciceronian	17
and	17
Demosthenian	17
eloquence	17
to	17
sound	17
its	17
praises?”	17
“What	17
does	17
Demosthenian	17
mean,	17
Señor	17
Don	17
Quixote?”	17
said	17
the	17
duchess;	17
“it	17
is	17
a	17
word	17
I	17
never	17
heard	17
in	17
all	17
my	17
life.”	17
“Demosthenian	17
eloquence,”	17
said	17
Don	17
Quixote,	17
“means	17
the	17
eloquence	17
of	17
Demosthenes,	17
as	17
Ciceronian	17
means	17
that	17
of	17
Cicero,	17
who	17
were	17
the	17
two	17
most	17
eloquent	17
orators	17
in	17
the	17
world.”	17
“True,”	17
said	17
the	17
duke;	17
“you	17
must	17
have	17
lost	17
your	17
wits	17
to	17
ask	17
such	17
a	17
question.	17
Nevertheless,	17
Señor	17
Don	17
Quixote	17
would	17
greatly	17
gratify	17
us	17
if	17
he	17
would	17
depict	17
her	17
to	17
us;	17
for	17
never	17
fear,	17
even	17
in	17
an	17
outline	17
or	17
sketch	17
she	17
will	17
be	17
something	17
to	17
make	17
the	17
fairest	17
envious.”	17
“I	17
would	17
do	17
so	17
certainly,”	17
said	17
Don	17
Quixote,	17
“had	17
she	17
not	17
been	17
blurred	17
to	17
my	17
mind’s	17
eye	17
by	17
the	17
misfortune	17
that	17
fell	17
upon	17
her	17
a	17
short	17
time	17
since,	17
one	17
of	17
such	17
a	17
nature	17
that	17
I	17
am	17
more	17
ready	17
to	17
weep	17
over	17
it	17
than	17
to	17
describe	17
it.	17
For	17
your	17
highnesses	17
must	17
know	17
that,	17
going	17
a	17
few	17
days	17
back	17
to	17
kiss	17
her	17
hands	17
and	17
receive	17
her	17
benediction,	17
approbation,	17
and	17
permission	17
for	17
this	17
third	17
sally,	17
I	17
found	17
her	17
altogether	17
a	17
different	17
being	17
from	17
the	17
one	17
I	17
sought;	17
I	17
found	17
her	17
enchanted	17
and	17
changed	17
from	17
a	17
princess	17
into	17
a	17
peasant,	17
from	17
fair	17
to	17
foul,	17
from	17
an	17
angel	17
into	17
a	17
devil,	17
from	17
fragrant	17
to	17
pestiferous,	17
from	17
refined	17
to	17
clownish,	17
from	17
a	17
dignified	17
lady	17
into	17
a	17
jumping	17
tomboy,	17
and,	17
in	17
a	17
word,	17
from	17
Dulcinea	17
del	17
Toboso	17
into	17
a	17
coarse	17
Sayago	17
wench.”	17
“God	17
bless	17
me!”	17
said	17
the	17
duke	17
aloud	17
at	17
this,	17
“who	17
can	17
have	17
done	17
the	17
world	17
such	17
an	17
injury?	17
Who	17
can	17
have	17
robbed	17
it	17
of	17
the	17
beauty	17
that	17
gladdened	17
it,	17
of	17
the	17
grace	17
and	17
gaiety	17
that	17
charmed	17
it,	17
of	17
the	17
modesty	17
that	17
shed	17
a	17
lustre	17
upon	17
it?”	17
“Who?”	17
replied	17
Don	17
Quixote;	17
“who	17
could	17
it	17
be	17
but	17
some	17
malignant	17
enchanter	17
of	17
the	17
many	17
that	17
persecute	17
me	17
out	17
of	17
envy—that	17
accursed	17
race	17
born	17
into	17
the	17
world	17
to	17
obscure	17
and	17
bring	17
to	17
naught	17
the	17
achievements	17
of	17
the	17
good,	17
and	17
glorify	17
and	17
exalt	17
the	17
deeds	17
of	17
the	17
wicked?	17
Enchanters	17
have	17
persecuted	17
me,	17
enchanters	17
persecute	17
me	17
still,	17
and	17
enchanters	17
will	17
continue	17
to	17
persecute	17
me	17
until	17
they	17
have	17
sunk	17
me	17
and	17
my	17
lofty	17
chivalry	17
in	17
the	17
deep	17
abyss	17
of	17
oblivion;	17
and	17
they	17
injure	17
and	17
wound	17
me	17
where	17
they	17
know	17
I	17
feel	17
it	17
most.	17
For	17
to	17
deprive	17
a	17
knight-errant	17
of	17
his	17
lady	17
is	17
to	17
deprive	17
him	17
of	17
the	17
eyes	17
he	17
sees	17
with,	17
of	17
the	17
sun	17
that	17
gives	17
him	17
light,	17
of	17
the	17
food	17
whereby	17
he	17
lives.	17
Many	17
a	17
time	17
before	17
have	17
I	17
said	17
it,	17
and	17
I	17
say	17
it	17
now	17
once	17
more,	17
a	17
knight-errant	17
without	17
a	17
lady	17
is	17
like	17
a	17
tree	17
without	17
leaves,	17
a	17
building	17
without	17
a	17
foundation,	17
or	17
a	17
shadow	17
without	17
the	17
body	17
that	17
causes	17
it.”	17
“There	17
is	17
no	17
denying	17
it,”	17
said	17
the	17
duchess;	17
“but	17
still,	17
if	17
we	17
are	17
to	17
believe	17
the	17
history	17
of	17
Don	17
Quixote	17
that	17
has	17
come	17
out	17
here	17
lately	17
with	17
general	17
applause,	17
it	17
is	17
to	17
be	17
inferred	17
from	17
it,	17
if	17
I	17
mistake	17
not,	17
that	17
you	17
never	17
saw	17
the	17
lady	17
Dulcinea,	17
and	17
that	17
the	17
said	17
lady	17
is	17
nothing	17
in	17
the	17
world	17
but	17
an	17
imaginary	17
lady,	17
one	17
that	17
you	17
yourself	17
begot	17
and	17
gave	17
birth	17
to	17
in	17
your	17
brain,	17
and	17
adorned	17
with	17
whatever	17
charms	17
and	17
perfections	17
you	17
chose.”	17
“There	17
is	17
a	17
good	17
deal	17
to	17
be	17
said	17
on	17
that	17
point,”	17
said	17
Don	17
Quixote;	17
“God	17
knows	17
whether	17
there	17
be	17
any	17
Dulcinea	17
or	17
not	17
in	17
the	17
world,	17
or	17
whether	17
she	17
is	17
imaginary	17
or	17
not	17
imaginary;	17
these	17
are	17
things	17
the	17
proof	17
of	17
which	17
must	17
not	17
be	17
pushed	17
to	17
extreme	17
lengths.	17
I	17
have	17
not	17
begotten	17
nor	17
given	17
birth	17
to	17
my	17
lady,	17
though	17
I	17
behold	17
her	17
as	17
she	17
needs	17
must	17
be,	17
a	17
lady	17
who	17
contains	17
in	17
herself	17
all	17
the	17
qualities	17
to	17
make	17
her	17
famous	17
throughout	17
the	17
world,	17
beautiful	17
without	17
blemish,	17
dignified	17
without	17
haughtiness,	17
tender	17
and	17
yet	17
modest,	17
gracious	17
from	17
courtesy	17
and	17
courteous	17
from	17
good	17
breeding,	17
and	17
lastly,	17
of	17
exalted	17
lineage,	17
because	17
beauty	17
shines	17
forth	17
and	17
excels	17
with	17
a	17
higher	17
degree	17
of	17
perfection	17
upon	17
good	17
blood	17
than	17
in	17
the	17
fair	17
of	17
lowly	17
birth.”	17
“That	17
is	17
true,”	17
said	17
the	17
duke;	17
“but	17
Señor	17
Don	17
Quixote	17
will	17
give	17
me	17
leave	17
to	17
say	17
what	17
I	17
am	17
constrained	17
to	17
say	17
by	17
the	17
story	17
of	17
his	17
exploits	17
that	17
I	17
have	17
read,	17
from	17
which	17
it	17
is	17
to	17
be	17
inferred	17
that,	17
granting	17
there	17
is	17
a	17
Dulcinea	17
in	17
El	17
Toboso,	17
or	17
out	17
of	17
it,	17
and	17
that	17
she	17
is	17
in	17
the	17
highest	17
degree	17
beautiful	17
as	17
you	17
have	17
described	17
her	17
to	17
us,	17
as	17
regards	17
the	17
loftiness	17
of	17
her	17
lineage	17
she	17
is	17
not	17
on	17
a	17
par	17
with	17
the	17
Orianas,	17
Alastrajareas,	17
Madasimas,	17
or	17
others	17
of	17
that	17
sort,	17
with	17
whom,	17
as	17
you	17
well	17
know,	17
the	17
histories	17
abound.”	17
“To	17
that	17
I	17
may	17
reply,”	17
said	17
Don	17
Quixote,	17
“that	17
Dulcinea	17
is	17
the	17
daughter	17
of	17
her	17
own	17
works,	17
and	17
that	17
virtues	17
rectify	17
blood,	17
and	17
that	17
lowly	17
virtue	17
is	17
more	17
to	17
be	17
regarded	17
and	17
esteemed	17
than	17
exalted	17
vice.	17
Dulcinea,	17
besides,	17
has	17
that	17
within	17
her	17
that	17
may	17
raise	17
her	17
to	17
be	17
a	17
crowned	17
and	17
sceptred	17
queen;	17
for	17
the	17
merit	17
of	17
a	17
fair	17
and	17
virtuous	17
woman	17
is	17
capable	17
of	17
performing	17
greater	17
miracles;	17
and	17
virtually,	17
though	17
not	17
formally,	17
she	17
has	17
in	17
herself	17
higher	17
fortunes.”	17
“I	17
protest,	17
Señor	17
Don	17
Quixote,”	17
said	17
the	17
duchess,	17
“that	17
in	17
all	17
you	17
say,	17
you	17
go	17
most	17
cautiously	17
and	17
lead	17
in	17
hand,	17
as	17
the	17
saying	17
is;	17
henceforth	17
I	17
will	17
believe	17
myself,	17
and	17
I	17
will	17
take	17
care	17
that	17
everyone	17
in	17
my	17
house	17
believes,	17
even	17
my	17
lord	17
the	17
duke	17
if	17
needs	17
be,	17
that	17
there	17
is	17
a	17
Dulcinea	17
in	17
El	17
Toboso,	17
and	17
that	17
she	17
is	17
living	17
to-day,	17
and	17
that	17
she	17
is	17
beautiful	17
and	17
nobly	17
born	17
and	17
deserves	17
to	17
have	17
such	17
a	17
knight	17
as	17
Señor	17
Don	17
Quixote	17
in	17
her	17
service,	17
and	17
that	17
is	17
the	17
highest	17
praise	17
that	17
it	17
is	17
in	17
my	17
power	17
to	17
give	17
her	17
or	17
that	17
I	17
can	17
think	17
of.	17
But	17
I	17
cannot	17
help	17
entertaining	17
a	17
doubt,	17
and	17
having	17
a	17
certain	17
grudge	17
against	17
Sancho	17
Panza;	17
the	17
doubt	17
is	17
this,	17
that	17
the	17
aforesaid	17
history	17
declares	17
that	17
the	17
said	17
Sancho	17
Panza,	17
when	17
he	17
carried	17
a	17
letter	17
on	17
your	17
worship’s	17
behalf	17
to	17
the	17
said	17
lady	17
Dulcinea,	17
found	17
her	17
sifting	17
a	17
sack	17
of	17
wheat;	17
and	17
more	17
by	17
token	17
it	17
says	17
it	17
was	17
red	17
wheat;	17
a	17
thing	17
which	17
makes	17
me	17
doubt	17
the	17
loftiness	17
of	17
her	17
lineage.”	17
To	17
this	17
Don	17
Quixote	17
made	17
answer,	17
“Señora,	17
your	17
highness	17
must	17
know	17
that	17
everything	17
or	17
almost	17
everything	17
that	17
happens	17
me	17
transcends	17
the	17
ordinary	17
limits	17
of	17
what	17
happens	17
to	17
other	17
knights-errant;	17
whether	17
it	17
be	17
that	17
it	17
is	17
directed	17
by	17
the	17
inscrutable	17
will	17
of	17
destiny,	17
or	17
by	17
the	17
malice	17
of	17
some	17
jealous	17
enchanter.	17
Now	17
it	17
is	17
an	17
established	17
fact	17
that	17
all	17
or	17
most	17
famous	17
knights-errant	17
have	17
some	17
special	17
gift,	17
one	17
that	17
of	17
being	17
proof	17
against	17
enchantment,	17
another	17
that	17
of	17
being	17
made	17
of	17
such	17
invulnerable	17
flesh	17
that	17
he	17
cannot	17
be	17
wounded,	17
as	17
was	17
the	17
famous	17
Roland,	17
one	17
of	17
the	17
twelve	17
peers	17
of	17
France,	17
of	17
whom	17
it	17
is	17
related	17
that	17
he	17
could	17
not	17
be	17
wounded	17
except	17
in	17
the	17
sole	17
of	17
his	17
left	17
foot,	17
and	17
that	17
it	17
must	17
be	17
with	17
the	17
point	17
of	17
a	17
stout	17
pin	17
and	17
not	17
with	17
any	17
other	17
sort	17
of	17
weapon	17
whatever;	17
and	17
so,	17
when	17
Bernardo	17
del	17
Carpio	17
slew	17
him	17
at	17
Roncesvalles,	17
finding	17
that	17
he	17
could	17
not	17
wound	17
him	17
with	17
steel,	17
he	17
lifted	17
him	17
up	17
from	17
the	17
ground	17
in	17
his	17
arms	17
and	17
strangled	17
him,	17
calling	17
to	17
mind	17
seasonably	17
the	17
death	17
which	17
Hercules	17
inflicted	17
on	17
Antæus,	17
the	17
fierce	17
giant	17
that	17
they	17
say	17
was	17
the	17
son	17
of	17
Terra.	17
I	17
would	17
infer	17
from	17
what	17
I	17
have	17
mentioned	17
that	17
perhaps	17
I	17
may	17
have	17
some	17
gift	17
of	17
this	17
kind,	17
not	17
that	17
of	17
being	17
invulnerable,	17
because	17
experience	17
has	17
many	17
times	17
proved	17
to	17
me	17
that	17
I	17
am	17
of	17
tender	17
flesh	17
and	17
not	17
at	17
all	17
impenetrable;	17
nor	17
that	17
of	17
being	17
proof	17
against	17
enchantment,	17
for	17
I	17
have	17
already	17
seen	17
myself	17
thrust	17
into	17
a	17
cage,	17
in	17
which	17
all	17
the	17
world	17
would	17
not	17
have	17
been	17
able	17
to	17
confine	17
me	17
except	17
by	17
force	17
of	17
enchantments.	17
But	17
as	17
I	17
delivered	17
myself	17
from	17
that	17
one,	17
I	17
am	17
inclined	17
to	17
believe	17
that	17
there	17
is	17
no	17
other	17
that	17
can	17
hurt	17
me;	17
and	17
so,	17
these	17
enchanters,	17
seeing	17
that	17
they	17
cannot	17
exert	17
their	17
vile	17
craft	17
against	17
my	17
person,	17
revenge	17
themselves	17
on	17
what	17
I	17
love	17
most,	17
and	17
seek	17
to	17
rob	17
me	17
of	17
life	17
by	17
maltreating	17
that	17
of	17
Dulcinea	17
in	17
whom	17
I	17
live;	17
and	17
therefore	17
I	17
am	17
convinced	17
that	17
when	17
my	17
squire	17
carried	17
my	17
message	17
to	17
her,	17
they	17
changed	17
her	17
into	17
a	17
common	17
peasant	17
girl,	17
engaged	17
in	17
such	17
a	17
mean	17
occupation	17
as	17
sifting	17
wheat;	17
I	17
have	17
already	17
said,	17
however,	17
that	18
wheat	18
was	18
not	18
red	18
wheat,	18
nor	18
wheat	18
at	18
all,	18
but	18
grains	18
of	18
orient	18
pearl.	18
And	18
as	18
a	18
proof	18
of	18
all	18
this,	18
I	18
must	18
tell	18
your	18
highnesses	18
that,	18
coming	18
to	18
El	18
Toboso	18
a	18
short	18
time	18
back,	18
I	18
was	18
altogether	18
unable	18
to	18
discover	18
the	18
palace	18
of	18
Dulcinea;	18
and	18
that	18
the	18
next	18
day,	18
though	18
Sancho,	18
my	18
squire,	18
saw	18
her	18
in	18
her	18
own	18
proper	18
shape,	18
which	18
is	18
the	18
fairest	18
in	18
the	18
world,	18
to	18
me	18
she	18
appeared	18
to	18
be	18
a	18
coarse,	18
ill-favoured	18
farm-wench,	18
and	18
by	18
no	18
means	18
a	18
well-spoken	18
one,	18
she	18
who	18
is	18
propriety	18
itself.	18
And	18
so,	18
as	18
I	18
am	18
not	18
and,	18
so	18
far	18
as	18
one	18
can	18
judge,	18
cannot	18
be	18
enchanted,	18
she	18
it	18
is	18
that	18
is	18
enchanted,	18
that	18
is	18
smitten,	18
that	18
is	18
altered,	18
changed,	18
and	18
transformed;	18
in	18
her	18
have	18
my	18
enemies	18
revenged	18
themselves	18
upon	18
me,	18
and	18
for	18
her	18
shall	18
I	18
live	18
in	18
ceaseless	18
tears,	18
until	18
I	18
see	18
her	18
in	18
her	18
pristine	18
state.	18
I	18
have	18
mentioned	18
this	18
lest	18
anybody	18
should	18
mind	18
what	18
Sancho	18
said	18
about	18
Dulcinea’s	18
winnowing	18
or	18
sifting;	18
for,	18
as	18
they	18
changed	18
her	18
to	18
me,	18
it	18
is	18
no	18
wonder	18
if	18
they	18
changed	18
her	18
to	18
him.	18
Dulcinea	18
is	18
illustrious	18
and	18
well-born,	18
and	18
of	18
one	18
of	18
the	18
gentle	18
families	18
of	18
El	18
Toboso,	18
which	18
are	18
many,	18
ancient,	18
and	18
good.	18
Therein,	18
most	18
assuredly,	18
not	18
small	18
is	18
the	18
share	18
of	18
the	18
peerless	18
Dulcinea,	18
through	18
whom	18
her	18
town	18
will	18
be	18
famous	18
and	18
celebrated	18
in	18
ages	18
to	18
come,	18
as	18
Troy	18
was	18
through	18
Helen,	18
and	18
Spain	18
through	18
La	18
Cava,	18
though	18
with	18
a	18
better	18
title	18
and	18
tradition.	18
For	18
another	18
thing;	18
I	18
would	18
have	18
your	18
graces	18
understand	18
that	18
Sancho	18
Panza	18
is	18
one	18
of	18
the	18
drollest	18
squires	18
that	18
ever	18
served	18
knight-errant;	18
sometimes	18
there	18
is	18
a	18
simplicity	18
about	18
him	18
so	18
acute	18
that	18
it	18
is	18
an	18
amusement	18
to	18
try	18
and	18
make	18
out	18
whether	18
he	18
is	18
simple	18
or	18
sharp;	18
he	18
has	18
mischievous	18
tricks	18
that	18
stamp	18
him	18
rogue,	18
and	18
blundering	18
ways	18
that	18
prove	18
him	18
a	18
booby;	18
he	18
doubts	18
everything	18
and	18
believes	18
everything;	18
when	18
I	18
fancy	18
he	18
is	18
on	18
the	18
point	18
of	18
coming	18
down	18
headlong	18
from	18
sheer	18
stupidity,	18
he	18
comes	18
out	18
with	18
something	18
shrewd	18
that	18
sends	18
him	18
up	18
to	18
the	18
skies.	18
After	18
all,	18
I	18
would	18
not	18
exchange	18
him	18
for	18
another	18
squire,	18
though	18
I	18
were	18
given	18
a	18
city	18
to	18
boot,	18
and	18
therefore	18
I	18
am	18
in	18
doubt	18
whether	18
it	18
will	18
be	18
well	18
to	18
send	18
him	18
to	18
the	18
government	18
your	18
highness	18
has	18
bestowed	18
upon	18
him;	18
though	18
I	18
perceive	18
in	18
him	18
a	18
certain	18
aptitude	18
for	18
the	18
work	18
of	18
governing,	18
so	18
that,	18
with	18
a	18
little	18
trimming	18
of	18
his	18
understanding,	18
he	18
would	18
manage	18
any	18
government	18
as	18
easily	18
as	18
the	18
king	18
does	18
his	18
taxes;	18
and	18
moreover,	18
we	18
know	18
already	18
ample	18
experience	18
that	18
it	18
does	18
not	18
require	18
much	18
cleverness	18
or	18
much	18
learning	18
to	18
be	18
a	18
governor,	18
for	18
there	18
are	18
a	18
hundred	18
round	18
about	18
us	18
that	18
scarcely	18
know	18
how	18
to	18
read,	18
and	18
govern	18
like	18
gerfalcons.	18
The	18
main	18
point	18
is	18
that	18
they	18
should	18
have	18
good	18
intentions	18
and	18
be	18
desirous	18
of	18
doing	18
right	18
in	18
all	18
things,	18
for	18
they	18
will	18
never	18
be	18
at	18
a	18
loss	18
for	18
persons	18
to	18
advise	18
and	18
direct	18
them	18
in	18
what	18
they	18
have	18
to	18
do,	18
like	18
those	18
knight-governors	18
who,	18
being	18
no	18
lawyers,	18
pronounce	18
sentences	18
with	18
the	18
aid	18
of	18
an	18
assessor.	18
My	18
advice	18
to	18
him	18
will	18
be	18
to	18
take	18
no	18
bribe	18
and	18
surrender	18
no	18
right,	18
and	18
I	18
have	18
some	18
other	18
little	18
matters	18
in	18
reserve,	18
that	18
shall	18
be	18
produced	18
in	18
due	18
season	18
for	18
Sancho’s	18
benefit	18
and	18
the	18
advantage	18
of	18
the	18
island	18
he	18
is	18
to	18
govern.”	18
The	18
duke,	18
duchess,	18
and	18
Don	18
Quixote	18
had	18
reached	18
this	18
point	18
in	18
their	18
conversation,	18
when	18
they	18
heard	18
voices	18
and	18
a	18
great	18
hubbub	18
in	18
the	18
palace,	18
and	18
Sancho	18
burst	18
abruptly	18
into	18
the	18
room	18
all	18
glowing	18
with	18
anger,	18
with	18
a	18
straining-cloth	18
by	18
way	18
of	18
a	18
bib,	18
and	18
followed	18
by	18
several	18
servants,	18
or,	18
more	18
properly	18
speaking,	18
kitchen-boys	18
and	18
other	18
underlings,	18
one	18
of	18
whom	18
carried	18
a	18
small	18
trough	18
full	18
of	18
water,	18
that	18
from	18
its	18
colour	18
and	18
impurity	18
was	18
plainly	18
dishwater.	18
The	18
one	18
with	18
the	18
trough	18
pursued	18
him	18
and	18
followed	18
him	18
everywhere	18
he	18
went,	18
endeavouring	18
with	18
the	18
utmost	18
persistence	18
to	18
thrust	18
it	18
under	18
his	18
chin,	18
while	18
another	18
kitchen-boy	18
seemed	18
anxious	18
to	18
wash	18
his	18
beard.	18
“What	18
is	18
all	18
this,	18
brothers?”	18
asked	18
the	18
duchess.	18
“What	18
is	18
it?	18
What	18
do	18
you	18
want	18
to	18
do	18
to	18
this	18
good	18
man?	18
Do	18
you	18
forget	18
he	18
is	18
a	18
governor-elect?”	18
To	18
which	18
the	18
barber	18
kitchen-boy	18
replied,	18
“The	18
gentleman	18
will	18
not	18
let	18
himself	18
be	18
washed	18
as	18
is	18
customary,	18
and	18
as	18
my	18
lord	18
and	18
the	18
señor	18
his	18
master	18
have	18
been.”	18
“Yes,	18
I	18
will,”	18
said	18
Sancho,	18
in	18
a	18
great	18
rage;	18
“but	18
I’d	18
like	18
it	18
to	18
be	18
with	18
cleaner	18
towels,	18
clearer	18
lye,	18
and	18
not	18
such	18
dirty	18
hands;	18
for	18
there’s	18
not	18
so	18
much	18
difference	18
between	18
me	18
and	18
my	18
master	18
that	18
he	18
should	18
be	18
washed	18
with	18
angels’	18
water	18
and	18
I	18
with	18
devil’s	18
lye.	18
The	18
customs	18
of	18
countries	18
and	18
princes’	18
palaces	18
are	18
only	18
good	18
so	18
long	18
as	18
they	18
give	18
no	18
annoyance;	18
but	18
the	18
way	18
of	18
washing	18
they	18
have	18
here	18
is	18
worse	18
than	18
doing	18
penance.	18
I	18
have	18
a	18
clean	18
beard,	18
and	18
I	18
don’t	18
require	18
to	18
be	18
refreshed	18
in	18
that	18
fashion,	18
and	18
whoever	18
comes	18
to	18
wash	18
me	18
or	18
touch	18
a	18
hair	18
of	18
my	18
head,	18
I	18
mean	18
to	18
say	18
my	18
beard,	18
with	18
all	18
due	18
respect	18
be	18
it	18
said,	18
I’ll	18
give	18
him	18
a	18
punch	18
that	18
will	18
leave	18
my	18
fist	18
sunk	18
in	18
his	18
skull;	18
for	18
cirimonies	18
and	18
soapings	18
of	18
this	18
sort	18
are	18
more	18
like	18
jokes	18
than	18
the	18
polite	18
attentions	18
of	18
one’s	18
host.”	18
The	18
duchess	18
was	18
ready	18
to	18
die	18
with	18
laughter	18
when	18
she	18
saw	18
Sancho’s	18
rage	18
and	18
heard	18
his	18
words;	18
but	18
it	18
was	18
no	18
pleasure	18
to	18
Don	18
Quixote	18
to	18
see	18
him	18
in	18
such	18
a	18
sorry	18
trim,	18
with	18
the	18
dingy	18
towel	18
about	18
him,	18
and	18
the	18
hangers-on	18
of	18
the	18
kitchen	18
all	18
round	18
him;	18
so	18
making	18
a	18
low	18
bow	18
to	18
the	18
duke	18
and	18
duchess,	18
as	18
if	18
to	18
ask	18
their	18
permission	18
to	18
speak,	18
he	18
addressed	18
the	18
rout	18
in	18
a	18
dignified	18
tone:	18
“Holloa,	18
gentlemen!	18
you	18
let	18
that	18
youth	18
alone,	18
and	18
go	18
back	18
to	18
where	18
you	18
came	18
from,	18
or	18
anywhere	18
else	18
if	18
you	18
like;	18
my	18
squire	18
is	18
as	18
clean	18
as	18
any	18
other	18
person,	18
and	18
those	18
troughs	18
are	18
as	18
bad	18
as	18
narrow	18
thin-necked	18
jars	18
to	18
him;	18
take	18
my	18
advice	18
and	18
leave	18
him	18
alone,	18
for	18
neither	18
he	18
nor	18
I	18
understand	18
joking.”	18
Sancho	18
took	18
the	18
word	18
out	18
of	18
his	18
mouth	18
and	18
went	18
on,	18
“Nay,	18
let	18
them	18
come	18
and	18
try	18
their	18
jokes	18
on	18
the	18
country	18
bumpkin,	18
for	18
it’s	18
about	18
as	18
likely	18
I’ll	18
stand	18
them	18
as	18
that	18
it’s	18
now	18
midnight!	18
Let	18
them	18
bring	18
me	18
a	18
comb	18
here,	18
or	18
what	18
they	18
please,	18
and	18
curry	18
this	18
beard	18
of	18
mine,	18
and	18
if	18
they	18
get	18
anything	18
out	18
of	18
it	18
that	18
offends	18
against	18
cleanliness,	18
let	18
them	18
clip	18
me	18
to	18
the	18
skin.”	18
Upon	18
this,	18
the	18
duchess,	18
laughing	18
all	18
the	18
while,	18
said,	18
“Sancho	18
Panza	18
is	18
right,	18
and	18
always	18
will	18
be	18
in	18
all	18
he	18
says;	18
he	18
is	18
clean,	18
and,	18
as	18
he	18
says	18
himself,	18
he	18
does	18
not	18
require	18
to	18
be	18
washed;	18
and	18
if	18
our	18
ways	18
do	18
not	18
please	18
him,	18
he	18
is	18
free	18
to	18
choose.	18
Besides,	18
you	18
promoters	18
of	18
cleanliness	18
have	18
been	18
excessively	18
careless	18
and	18
thoughtless,	18
I	18
don’t	18
know	18
if	18
I	18
ought	18
not	18
to	18
say	18
audacious,	18
to	18
bring	18
troughs	18
and	18
wooden	18
utensils	18
and	18
kitchen	18
dishclouts,	18
instead	18
of	18
basins	18
and	18
jugs	18
of	18
pure	18
gold	18
and	18
towels	18
of	18
holland,	18
to	18
such	18
a	18
person	18
and	18
such	18
a	18
beard;	18
but,	18
after	18
all,	18
you	18
are	18
ill-conditioned	18
and	18
ill-bred,	18
and	18
spiteful	18
as	18
you	18
are,	18
you	18
cannot	18
help	18
showing	18
the	18
grudge	18
you	18
have	18
against	18
the	18
squires	18
of	18
knights-errant.”	18
The	18
impudent	18
servitors,	18
and	18
even	18
the	18
seneschal	18
who	18
came	18
with	18
them,	18
took	18
the	18
duchess	18
to	18
be	18
speaking	18
in	18
earnest,	18
so	18
they	18
removed	18
the	18
straining-cloth	18
from	18
Sancho’s	18
neck,	18
and	18
with	18
something	18
like	18
shame	18
and	18
confusion	18
of	18
face	18
went	18
off	18
all	18
of	18
them	18
and	18
left	18
him;	18
whereupon	18
he,	18
seeing	18
himself	18
safe	18
out	18
of	18
that	18
extreme	18
danger,	18
as	18
it	18
seemed	18
to	18
him,	18
ran	18
and	18
fell	18
on	18
his	18
knees	18
before	18
the	18
duchess,	18
saying,	18
“From	18
great	18
ladies	18
great	18
favours	18
may	18
be	18
looked	18
for;	18
this	18
which	18
your	18
grace	18
has	18
done	18
me	18
to-day	18
cannot	18
be	18
requited	18
with	18
less	18
than	18
wishing	18
I	18
was	18
dubbed	18
a	18
knight-errant,	18
to	18
devote	18
myself	18
all	18
the	18
days	18
of	18
my	18
life	18
to	18
the	18
service	18
of	18
so	18
exalted	18
a	18
lady.	18
I	18
am	18
a	18
labouring	18
man,	18
my	18
name	18
is	18
Sancho	18
Panza,	18
I	18
am	18
married,	18
I	18
have	18
children,	18
and	18
I	18
am	18
serving	18
as	18
a	18
squire;	18
if	18
in	18
any	18
one	18
of	18
these	18
ways	18
I	18
can	18
serve	18
your	18
highness,	18
I	18
will	18
not	18
be	18
longer	18
in	18
obeying	18
than	18
your	18
grace	18
in	18
commanding.”	18
“It	18
is	18
easy	18
to	18
see,	18
Sancho,”	18
replied	18
the	18
duchess,	18
“that	18
you	18
have	18
learned	18
to	18
be	18
polite	18
in	18
the	18
school	18
of	18
politeness	18
itself;	18
I	18
mean	18
to	18
say	18
it	18
is	18
easy	18
to	18
see	18
that	18
you	18
have	18
been	18
nursed	18
in	18
the	18
bosom	18
of	18
Señor	18
Don	18
Quixote,	18
who	18
is,	18
of	18
course,	18
the	18
cream	18
of	18
good	18
breeding	18
and	18
flower	18
of	18
ceremony—or	18
cirimony,	18
as	18
you	18
would	18
say	18
yourself.	18
Fair	18
be	18
the	18
fortunes	18
of	18
such	18
a	18
master	18
and	18
such	18
a	18
servant,	18
the	18
one	18
the	18
cynosure	18
of	18
knight-errantry,	18
the	18
other	18
the	18
star	18
of	18
squirely	18
fidelity!	18
Rise,	18
Sancho,	18
my	18
friend;	18
I	18
will	18
repay	18
your	18
courtesy	18
by	18
taking	18
care	18
that	18
my	18
lord	18
the	18
duke	18
makes	18
good	18
to	18
you	18
the	18
promised	18
gift	18
of	18
the	18
government	18
as	18
soon	18
as	18
possible.”	18
With	18
this,	18
the	18
conversation	18
came	18
to	18
an	18
end,	18
and	18
Don	18
Quixote	18
retired	18
to	18
take	18
his	18
midday	18
sleep;	18
but	18
the	18
duchess	18
begged	18
Sancho,	18
unless	18
he	18
had	18
a	18
very	18
great	18
desire	18
to	18
go	18
to	18
sleep,	18
to	18
come	18
and	18
spend	18
the	18
afternoon	18
with	18
her	18
and	18
her	18
damsels	18
in	18
a	18
very	18
cool	18
chamber.	18
Sancho	18
replied	18
that,	18
though	18
he	18
certainly	18
had	18
the	18
habit	18
of	18
sleeping	18
four	18
or	18
five	18
hours	18
in	18
the	18
heat	18
of	18
the	18
day	18
in	18
summer,	18
to	18
serve	18
her	18
excellence	18
he	18
would	18
try	18
with	18
all	18
his	18
might	18
not	18
to	18
sleep	18
even	18
one	18
that	18
day,	18
and	18
that	18
he	18
would	18
come	18
in	18
obedience	18
to	18
her	18
command,	18
and	18
with	18
that	18
he	18
went	18
off.	18
The	18
duke	18
gave	18
fresh	18
orders	18
with	18
respect	18
to	18
treating	18
Don	18
Quixote	18
as	18
a	18
knight-errant,	18
without	18
departing	18
even	18
in	18
smallest	18
particular	18
from	18
the	18
style	18
in	18
which,	18
as	18
the	18
stories	18
tell	18
us,	18
they	18
used	18
to	18
treat	18
the	18
knights	18
of	18
old.	18

The	18
history	18
records	18
that	18
Sancho	18
did	18
not	18
sleep	18
that	18
afternoon,	18
but	18
in	18
order	18
to	18
keep	18
his	18
word	18
came,	18
before	18
he	18
had	18
well	18
done	18
dinner,	18
to	18
visit	18
the	18
duchess,	18
who,	18
finding	18
enjoyment	18
in	18
listening	18
to	18
him,	18
made	18
him	18
sit	18
down	18
beside	18
her	18
on	18
a	18
low	18
seat,	18
though	18
Sancho,	18
out	18
of	18
pure	18
good	18
breeding,	18
wanted	18
not	18
to	18
sit	18
down;	18
the	18
duchess,	18
however,	18
told	18
him	18
he	18
was	18
to	18
sit	18
down	18
as	18
governor	18
and	18
talk	18
as	18
squire,	18
as	18
in	18
both	18
respects	18
he	18
was	18
worthy	18
of	18
even	18
the	18
chair	18
of	18
the	18
Cid	18
Ruy	18
Diaz	18
the	18
Campeador.	18
Sancho	18
shrugged	18
his	18
shoulders,	18
obeyed,	18
and	18
sat	18
down,	18
and	18
all	18
the	18
duchess’s	18
damsels	18
and	18
duennas	18
gathered	18
round	18
him,	18
waiting	18
in	18
profound	18
silence	18
to	18
hear	18
what	18
he	18
would	18
say.	18
It	18
was	18
the	18
duchess,	18
however,	18
who	18
spoke	18
first,	18
saying:	18
“Now	18
that	18
we	18
are	18
alone,	18
and	18
that	18
there	18
is	18
nobody	18
here	18
to	18
overhear	18
us,	18
I	18
should	18
be	18
glad	18
if	18
the	18
señor	18
governor	18
would	18
relieve	18
me	18
of	18
certain	18
doubts	18
I	18
have,	18
rising	18
out	18
of	18
the	18
history	18
of	18
the	18
great	18
Don	18
Quixote	18
that	18
is	18
now	18
in	18
print.	18
One	18
is:	18
inasmuch	18
as	18
worthy	18
Sancho	18
never	18
saw	18
Dulcinea,	18
I	18
mean	18
the	18
lady	18
Dulcinea	18
del	18
Toboso,	18
nor	18
took	18
Don	18
Quixote’s	18
letter	18
to	18
her,	18
for	18
it	18
was	18
left	18
in	18
the	18
memorandum	18
book	18
in	18
the	18
Sierra	18
Morena,	18
how	18
did	18
he	18
dare	18
to	18
invent	18
the	18
answer	18
and	18
all	18
that	18
about	18
finding	18
her	18
sifting	18
wheat,	18
the	18
whole	18
story	18
being	18
a	18
deception	18
and	18
falsehood,	18
and	18
so	18
much	18
to	18
the	18
prejudice	18
of	18
the	18
peerless	18
Dulcinea’s	18
good	18
name,	18
a	18
thing	18
that	18
is	18
not	18
at	18
all	18
becoming	18
the	18
character	18
and	18
fidelity	18
of	18
a	18
good	18

At	18
these	18
words,	18
Sancho,	18
without	18
uttering	18
one	18
in	18
reply,	18
got	18
up	18
from	18
his	18
chair,	18
and	18
with	18
noiseless	18
steps,	18
with	18
his	18
body	18
bent	18
and	18
his	18
finger	18
on	18
his	18
lips,	18
went	18
all	18
round	18
the	18
room	18
lifting	18
up	18
the	18
hangings;	18
and	18
this	18
done,	18
he	18
came	18
back	18
to	18
his	18
seat	18
and	18
said,	18
“Now,	18
señora,	18
that	18
I	18
have	18
seen	18
that	18
there	18
is	18
no	18
one	18
except	18
the	18
bystanders	18
listening	18
to	18
us	18
on	18
the	18
sly,	18
I	18
will	18
answer	18
what	18
you	18
have	18
asked	18
me,	18
and	18
all	18
you	18
may	18
ask	18
me,	18
without	18
fear	18
or	18
dread.	18
And	18
the	18
first	18
thing	18
I	18
have	18
got	18
to	18
say	18
is,	18
that	18
for	18
my	18
own	18
part	18
I	18
hold	18
my	18
master	18
Don	18
Quixote	18
to	18
be	18
stark	18
mad,	18
though	18
sometimes	18
he	18
says	18
things	18
that,	18
to	18
my	18
mind,	18
and	18
indeed	18
everybody’s	18
that	18
listens	18
to	18
him,	18
are	18
so	18
wise,	18
and	18
run	18
in	18
such	18
a	18
straight	18
furrow,	18
that	18
Satan	18
himself	18
could	18
not	18
have	18
said	18
them	18
better;	18
but	18
for	18
all	18
that,	18
really,	18
and	18
beyond	18
all	18
question,	18
it’s	18
my	18
firm	18
belief	18
he	18
is	18
cracked.	18
Well,	18
then,	18
as	18
this	18
is	18
clear	18
to	18
my	18
mind,	18
I	18
can	18
venture	18
to	18
make	18
him	18
believe	18
things	18
that	18
have	18
neither	18
head	18
nor	18
tail,	18
like	18
that	18
affair	18
of	18
the	18
answer	18
to	18
the	18
letter,	18
and	18
that	18
other	18
of	18
six	18
or	18
eight	18
days	18
ago,	18
which	18
is	18
not	18
yet	18
in	18
history,	18
that	18
is	18
to	18
say,	18
the	18
affair	18
of	18
the	18
enchantment	18
of	18
my	18
lady	18
Dulcinea;	18
for	18
I	18
made	18
him	18
believe	18
she	18
is	18
enchanted,	18
though	18
there’s	18
no	18
more	18
truth	18
in	18
it	18
than	18
over	18
the	18
hills	18
of	18
Úbeda.”	18
The	18
duchess	18
begged	18
him	18
to	18
tell	18
her	18
about	18
the	18
enchantment	18
or	18
deception,	18
so	18
Sancho	18
told	18
the	18
whole	18
story	18
exactly	18
as	18
it	18
had	18
happened,	18
and	18
his	18
hearers	18
were	18
not	18
a	18
little	18
amused	18
by	18
it;	18
and	18
then	18
resuming,	18
the	18
duchess	18
said,	18
“In	18
consequence	18
of	18
what	18
worthy	18
Sancho	18
has	18
told	18
me,	18
a	18
doubt	18
starts	18
up	18
in	18
my	18
mind,	18
and	18
there	18
comes	18
a	18
kind	18
of	18
whisper	18
to	18
my	18
ear	18
that	18
says,	18
‘If	18
Don	18
Quixote	18
be	18
mad,	18
crazy,	18
and	18
cracked,	18
and	18
Sancho	18
Panza	18
his	18
squire	18
knows	18
it,	18
and,	18
notwithstanding,	18
serves	18
and	18
follows	18
him,	18
and	18
goes	18
trusting	18
to	18
his	18
empty	18
promises,	18
there	18
can	18
be	18
no	18
doubt	18
he	18
must	18
be	18
still	18
madder	18
and	18
sillier	18
than	18
his	18
master;	18
and	18
that	18
being	18
so,	18
it	18
will	18
be	18
cast	18
in	18
your	18
teeth,	18
señora	18
duchess,	18
if	18
you	18
give	18
the	18
said	18
Sancho	18
an	18
island	18
to	18
govern;	18
for	18
how	18
will	18
he	18
who	18
does	18
not	18
know	18
how	18
to	18
govern	18
himself	18
know	18
how	18
to	18
govern	18
others?’”	18
“By	18
God,	18
señora,”	18
said	18
Sancho,	18
“but	18
that	18
doubt	18
comes	18
timely;	18
but	18
your	18
grace	18
may	18
say	18
it	18
out,	18
and	18
speak	18
plainly,	18
or	18
as	18
you	18
like;	18
for	18
I	18
know	18
what	18
you	18
say	18
is	18
true,	18
and	18
if	18
I	18
were	18
wise	18
I	18
should	18
have	18
left	18
my	18
master	18
long	18
ago;	18
but	18
this	18
was	18
my	18
fate,	18
this	18
was	18
my	18
bad	18
luck;	18
I	18
can’t	18
help	18
it,	18
I	18
must	18
follow	18
him;	18
we’re	18
from	18
the	18
same	18
village,	18
I’ve	18
eaten	18
his	18
bread,	18
I’m	18
fond	18
of	18
him,	18
I’m	18
grateful,	18
he	18
gave	18
me	18
his	18
ass-colts,	18
and	18
above	18
all	18
I’m	18
faithful;	18
so	18
it’s	18
quite	18
impossible	18
for	18
anything	18
to	18
separate	18
us,	18
except	18
the	18
pickaxe	18
and	18
shovel.	18
And	18
if	18
your	18
highness	18
does	18
not	18
like	18
to	18
give	18
me	18
the	18
government	18
you	18
promised,	18
God	18
made	18
me	18
without	18
it,	18
and	18
maybe	18
your	18
not	18
giving	18
it	18
to	18
me	18
will	18
be	18
all	18
the	18
better	18
for	18
my	18
conscience,	18
for	18
fool	18
as	18
I	18
am	18
I	18
know	18
the	18
proverb	18
‘to	18
her	18
hurt	18
the	18
ant	18
got	18
wings,’	18
and	18
it	18
may	18
be	18
that	18
Sancho	18
the	18
squire	18
will	18
get	18
to	18
heaven	18
sooner	18
than	18
Sancho	18
the	18
governor.	18
‘They	18
make	18
as	18
good	18
bread	18
here	18
as	18
in	18
France,’	18
and	18
‘by	18
night	18
all	18
cats	18
are	18
grey,’	18
and	18
‘a	18
hard	18
case	18
enough	18
his,	18
who	18
hasn’t	18
broken	18
his	18
fast	18
at	18
two	18
in	18
the	18

and	18
‘there’s	18
no	18
stomach	18
a	18
hand’s	18
breadth	18
bigger	18
than	18
another,’	18
and	18
the	18
same	18
can	18
be	18
filled	18
‘with	18
straw	18
or	18
hay,’	18
as	18
the	18
saying	18
is,	18
and	18
‘the	18
little	18
birds	18
of	18
the	18
field	18
have	18
God	18
for	18
their	18
purveyor	18
and	18
caterer,’	18
and	18
‘four	18
yards	18
of	18
Cuenca	18
frieze	18
keep	18
one	18
warmer	18
than	18
four	18
of	18
Segovia	18
broad-cloth,’	18
and	18
‘when	18

quit	18
this	18

are	18
put	18
underground	18
the	18
prince	18
travels	18
by	18

and	18
‘the	18

take	18
up	18
more	18
feet	18

than	18

for	18
all	18
that	18
the	18
one	18
is	18
higher	18
than	18
the	18
other;	18

small,	18
or	18
rather	18
they	18
pack	18
us	18
up	18
and	18
make	18
us	18
small	18
in	18
spite	18
of	18
us,	18
and	18
then—good	18
night	18
to	18
us.	18
And	18
I	18
say	18
once	18
more,	18
if	18
your	18
ladyship	18
does	18
not	18
like	18
to	18
give	18
me	18
the	18
island	18
because	18
I’m	18
a	18
fool,	18
like	18
a	18
wise	18
man	18
I	18
will	18
take	18
care	18
to	18
give	18
myself	18
no	18
trouble	18
about	18
it;	18
I	18
have	18
heard	18
say	18
that	18
‘behind	18
the	18
cross	18
there’s	18
the	18
devil,’	18
and	18
that	18
‘all	18
that	18
glitters	18
is	18
not	18
gold,’	18
and	18
that	18
from	18
among	18
the	18
oxen,	18
and	18
the	18
ploughs,	18
and	18
the	18
yokes,	18
Wamba	18
the	18
husbandman	18
was	18
taken	18
to	18
be	18
made	18
King	18
of	18
Spain,	18
and	18
from	18
among	18
brocades,	18
and	18
pleasures,	18
and	18
riches,	18
Roderick	18
was	18
taken	18
to	18
be	18
devoured	18
by	18
adders,	18
if	18
the	18
verses	18
of	18
the	18
old	18
ballads	18
don’t	18
lie.”	18
“To	18
be	18
sure	18
they	18
don’t	18
lie!”	18
exclaimed	18
Doña	18
Rodriguez,	18
the	18
duenna,	18
who	18
was	18
one	18
of	18
the	18
listeners.	18
“Why,	18
there’s	18
a	18
ballad	18
that	18
says	18
they	18
put	18
King	18
Rodrigo	18
alive	18
into	18
a	18
tomb	18
full	18
of	18
toads,	18
and	18
adders,	18
and	18
lizards,	18
and	18
that	18
two	18
days	18
afterwards	18
the	18
king,	18
in	18
a	18
plaintive,	18
feeble	18
voice,	18
cried	18
out	18
from	18
within	18
the	18
tomb-	18
They	18
gnaw	18
me	18
now,	18
they	18
gnaw	18
me	18
now,	18
There	18
where	18
I	18
most	18
did	18
sin.	18
And	18
according	18
to	18
that	18
the	18
gentleman	18
has	18
good	18
reason	18
to	18
say	18
he	18
would	18
rather	18
be	18
a	18
labouring	18
man	18
than	18
a	18
king,	18
if	18
vermin	18
are	18
to	18
eat	18
him.”	18
The	18
duchess	18
could	18
not	18
help	18
laughing	18
at	18
the	18
simplicity	18
of	18
her	18
duenna,	18
or	18
wondering	18
at	18
the	18
language	18
and	18
proverbs	18
of	18
Sancho,	18
to	18
whom	18
she	18
said,	18
“Worthy	18
Sancho	18
knows	18
very	18
well	18
that	18
when	18
once	18
a	18
knight	18
has	18
made	18
a	18
promise	18
he	18
strives	18
to	18
keep	18
it,	18
though	18
it	18
should	18
cost	18
him	18
his	18
life.	18
My	18
lord	18
and	18
husband	18
the	18
duke,	18
though	18
not	18
one	18
of	18
the	18
errant	18
sort,	18
is	18
none	18
the	18
less	18
a	18
knight	18
for	18
that	18
reason,	18
and	18
will	18
keep	18
his	18
word	18
about	18
the	18
promised	18
island,	18
in	18
spite	18
of	18
the	18
envy	18
and	18
malice	18
of	18
the	18
world.	18
Let	18
Sancho	18
be	18
of	18
good	18
cheer;	18
for	18
when	18
he	18
least	18
expects	18
it	18
he	18
will	18
find	18
himself	18
seated	18
on	18
the	18
throne	18
of	18
his	18
island	18
and	18
seat	18
of	18
dignity,	18
and	18
will	18
take	18
possession	18
of	18
his	18
government	18
that	18
he	18
may	18
discard	18
it	18
for	18
another	18
of	18
three-bordered	18
brocade.	18
The	18
charge	18
I	18
give	18
him	18
is	18
to	18
be	18
careful	18
how	18
he	18
governs	18
his	18
vassals,	18
bearing	18
in	18
mind	18
that	18
they	18
are	18
all	18
loyal	18
and	18
well-born.”	18
“As	18
to	18
governing	18
them	18
well,”	18
said	18
Sancho,	18
“there’s	18
no	18
need	18
of	18
charging	18
me	18
to	18
do	18
that,	18
for	18
I’m	18
kind-hearted	18
by	18
nature,	18
and	18
full	18
of	18
compassion	18
for	18
the	18
poor;	18
there’s	18
no	18
stealing	18
the	18
loaf	18
from	18
him	18
who	18
kneads	18
and	18
bakes;’	18
and	18
by	18
my	18
faith	18
it	18
won’t	18
do	18
to	18
throw	18
false	18
dice	18
with	18
me;	18
I	18
am	18
an	18
old	18
dog,	18
and	18
I	18
know	18
all	18
about	18
‘tus,	18
tus;’	18
I	18
can	18
be	18
wide-awake	18
if	18
need	18
be,	18
and	18
I	18
don’t	18
let	18
clouds	18
come	18
before	18
my	18
eyes,	18
for	18
I	18
know	18
where	18
the	18
shoe	18
pinches	18
me;	18
I	18
say	18
so,	18
because	18
with	18
me	18
the	18
good	18
will	18
have	18
support	18
and	18
protection,	18
and	18
the	18
bad	18
neither	18
footing	18
nor	18
access.	18
And	18
it	18
seems	18
to	18
me	18
that,	18
in	18
governments,	18
to	18
make	18
a	18
beginning	18
is	18
everything;	18
and	18
maybe,	18
after	18
having	18
been	18
governor	18
a	18
fortnight,	18
I’ll	18
take	18
kindly	18
to	18
the	18
work	18
and	18
know	18
more	18
about	18
it	18
than	18
the	18
field	18
labour	18
I	18
have	18
been	18
brought	18
up	18
to.”	18
“You	18
are	18
right,	18
Sancho,”	18
said	18
the	18
duchess,	18
“for	18
no	18
one	18
is	18
born	18
ready	18
taught,	18
and	18
the	18
bishops	18
are	18
made	18
out	18
of	18
men	18
and	18
not	18
out	18
of	18
stones.	18
But	18
to	18
return	18
to	18
the	18
subject	18
we	18
were	18
discussing	18
just	18
now,	18
the	18
enchantment	18
of	18
the	18
lady	18
Dulcinea,	18
I	18
look	18
upon	18
it	18
as	18
certain,	18
and	18
something	18
more	18
than	18
evident,	18
that	18
Sancho’s	18
idea	18
of	18
practising	18
a	18
deception	18
upon	18
his	18
master,	18
making	18
him	18
believe	18
that	18
the	18
peasant	18
girl	18
was	18
Dulcinea	18
and	18
that	18
if	18
he	18
did	18
not	18
recognise	18
her	18
it	18
must	18
be	18
because	18
she	18
was	18
enchanted,	18
was	18
all	18
a	18
device	18
of	18
one	18
of	18
the	18
enchanters	18
that	18
persecute	18
Don	18
Quixote.	18
For	18
in	18
truth	18
and	18
earnest,	18
I	18
know	18
from	18
good	18
authority	18
that	18
the	18
coarse	18
country	18
wench	18
who	18
jumped	18
up	18
on	18
the	18
ass	18
was	18
and	18
is	18
Dulcinea	18
del	18
Toboso,	18
and	18
that	18
worthy	18
Sancho,	18
though	18
he	18
fancies	18
himself	18
the	18
deceiver,	18
is	18
the	18
one	18
that	18
is	18
deceived;	18
and	18
that	18
there	18
is	18
no	18
more	18
reason	18
to	18
doubt	18
the	18
truth	18
of	18
this,	18
than	18
of	18
anything	18
else	18
we	18
never	18
saw.	18
Señor	18
Sancho	18
Panza	18
must	18
know	18
that	18
we	18
too	18
have	18
enchanters	18
here	18
that	18
are	18
well	18
disposed	18
to	18
us,	18
and	18
tell	18
us	18
what	18
goes	18
on	18
in	18
the	18
world,	18
plainly	18
and	18
distinctly,	18
without	18
subterfuge	18
or	18
deception;	18
and	18
believe	18
me,	18
Sancho,	18
that	18
agile	18
country	18
lass	18
was	18
and	18
is	18
Dulcinea	18
del	18
Toboso,	18
who	18
is	18
as	18
much	18
enchanted	18
as	18
the	18
mother	18
that	18
bore	18
her;	18
and	18
when	18
we	18
least	18
expect	18
it,	18
we	18
shall	18
see	18
her	18
in	18
her	18
own	18
proper	18
form,	18
and	18
then	18
Sancho	18
will	18
be	18
disabused	18
of	18
the	18
error	18
he	18
is	18
under	18
at	18
present.”	18
“All	18
that’s	18
very	18
possible,”	18
said	18
Sancho	18
Panza;	18
“and	18
now	18
I’m	18
willing	18
to	18
believe	18
what	18
my	18
master	18
says	18
about	18
what	18
he	18
saw	18
in	18
the	18
cave	18
of	18
Montesinos,	18
where	18
he	18
says	18
he	18
saw	18
the	18
lady	18
Dulcinea	18
del	18
Toboso	18
in	18
the	18
very	18
same	18
dress	18
and	18
apparel	18
that	18
I	18
said	18
I	18
had	18
seen	18
her	18
in	18
when	18
I	18
enchanted	18
her	18
all	18
to	18
please	18
myself.	18
It	18
must	18
be	18
all	18
exactly	18
the	18
other	18
way,	18
as	18
your	18
ladyship	18
says;	18
because	18
it	18
is	18
impossible	18
to	18
suppose	18
that	18
out	18
of	18
my	18
poor	18
wit	18
such	18
a	18
cunning	18
trick	18
could	18
be	18
concocted	18
in	18
a	18
moment,	18
nor	18
do	18
I	18
think	18
my	18
master	18
is	18
so	18
mad	18
that	18
by	18
my	18
weak	18
and	18
feeble	18
persuasion	18
he	18
could	18
be	18
made	18
to	18
believe	18
a	18
thing	18
so	18
out	18
of	18
all	18
reason.	18
But,	18
señora,	18
your	18
excellence	18
must	18
not	18
therefore	18
think	18
me	18
ill-disposed,	18
for	18
a	18
dolt	18
like	18
me	18
is	18
not	18
bound	18
to	18
see	18
into	18
the	18
thoughts	18
and	18
plots	18
of	18
those	18
vile	18
enchanters.	18
I	18
invented	18
all	18
that	18
to	18
escape	18
my	18
master’s	18
scolding,	18
and	18
not	18
with	18
any	18
intention	18
of	18
hurting	18
him;	18
and	18
if	18
it	18
has	18
turned	18
out	18
differently,	18
there	18
is	18
a	18
God	18
in	18
heaven	18
who	18
judges	18
our	18
hearts.”	18
“That	18
is	18
true,”	18
said	18
the	18
duchess;	18
“but	18
tell	18
me,	18
Sancho,	18
what	18
is	18
this	18
you	18
say	18
about	18
the	18
cave	18
of	18
Montesinos,	18
for	18
I	18
should	18
like	18
to	18
know.”	18
Sancho	18
upon	18
this	18
related	18
to	18
her,	18
word	18
for	18
word,	18
what	18
has	18
been	18
said	18
already	18
touching	18
that	18
adventure,	18
and	18
having	18
heard	18
it	18
the	18
duchess	18
said,	18
“From	18
this	18
occurrence	18
it	18
may	18
be	18
inferred	18
that,	18
as	18
the	18
great	18
Don	18
Quixote	18
says	18
he	18
saw	18
there	18
the	18
same	18
country	18
wench	18
Sancho	18
saw	18
on	18
the	18
way	18
from	18
El	18
Toboso,	18
it	18
is,	18
no	18
doubt,	18
Dulcinea,	18
and	18
that	18
there	18
are	18
some	18
very	18
active	18
and	18
exceedingly	18
busy	18
enchanters	18
about.”	18
“So	18
I	18
say,”	18
said	18
Sancho,	18
“and	18
if	18
my	18
lady	18
Dulcinea	18
is	18
enchanted,	18
so	18
much	18
the	18
worse	18
for	18
her,	18
and	18
I’m	18
not	18
going	18
to	18
pick	18
a	18
quarrel	18
with	18
my	18
master’s	18
enemies,	18
who	18
seem	18
to	18
be	18
many	18
and	18
spiteful.	18
The	18
truth	18
is	18
that	18
the	18
one	18
I	18
saw	18
was	18
a	18
country	18
wench,	18
and	18
I	18
set	18
her	18
down	18
to	18
be	18
a	18
country	18
wench;	18
and	18
if	18
that	18
was	18
Dulcinea	18
it	18
must	18
not	18
be	18
laid	18
at	18
my	18
door,	18
nor	18
should	18
I	18
be	18
called	18
to	18
answer	18
for	18
it	18
or	18
take	18
the	18
consequences.	18
But	18
they	18
must	18
go	18
nagging	18
at	18
me	18
at	18
every	18
step—‘Sancho	18
said	18
it,	18
Sancho	18
did	18
it,	18
Sancho	18
here,	18
Sancho	18
there,’	18
as	18
if	18
Sancho	18
was	18
nobody	18
at	18
all,	18
and	18
not	18
that	18
same	18
Sancho	18
Panza	18
that’s	18
now	18
going	18
all	18
over	18
the	18
world	18
in	18
books,	18
so	18
Samson	18
Carrasco	18
told	18
me,	18
and	18
he’s	18
at	18
any	18
rate	18
one	18
that’s	18
a	18
bachelor	18
of	18
Salamanca;	18
and	18
people	18
of	18
that	18
sort	18
can’t	18
lie,	18
except	18
when	18
the	18
whim	18
seizes	18
them	18
or	18
they	18
have	18
some	18
very	18
good	18
reason	18
for	18
it.	18
So	18
there’s	18
no	18
occasion	18
for	18
anybody	18
to	18
quarrel	18
with	18
me;	18
and	18
then	18
I	18
have	18
a	18
good	18
character,	18
and,	18
as	18
I	18
have	18
heard	18
my	18
master	18
say,	18
‘a	18
good	18
name	18
is	18
better	18
than	18
great	18
riches;’	18
let	18
them	18
only	18
stick	18
me	18
into	18
this	18
government	18
and	18
they’ll	18
see	18
wonders,	18
for	18
one	18
who	18
has	18
been	18
a	18
good	18
squire	18
will	18
be	18
a	18
good	18
governor.”	18
“All	18
worthy	18
Sancho’s	18
observations,”	18
said	18
the	18
duchess,	18
“are	18
Catonian	18
sentences,	18
or	18
at	18
any	18
rate	18
out	18
of	18
the	18
very	18
heart	18
of	18
Michael	18
Verino	18
himself,	18
who	18
_florentibus	18
occidit	18
annis_.	18
In	18
fact,	18
to	18
speak	18
in	18
his	18
own	18
style,	18
‘under	18
a	18
bad	18
cloak	18
there’s	18
often	18
a	18
good	18
drinker.’”	18
“Indeed,	18
señora,”	18
said	18
Sancho,	18
“I	18
never	18
yet	18
drank	18
out	18
of	18
wickedness;	18
from	18
thirst	18
I	18
have	18
very	18
likely,	18
for	18
I	18
have	18
nothing	18
of	18
the	18
hypocrite	18
in	18
me;	18
I	18
drink	18
when	18
I’m	18
inclined,	18
or,	18
if	18
I’m	18
not	18
inclined,	18
when	18
they	18
offer	18
it	18
to	18
me,	18
so	18
as	18
not	18
to	18
look	18
either	18
strait-laced	18
or	18
ill-bred;	18
for	18
when	18
a	18
friend	18
drinks	18
one’s	18
health	18
what	18
heart	18
can	18
be	18
so	18
hard	18
as	18
not	18
to	18
return	18
it?	18
But	18
if	18
I	18
put	18
on	18
my	18
shoes	18
I	18
don’t	18
dirty	18
them;	18
besides,	18
squires	18
to	18
knights-errant	18
mostly	18
drink	18
water,	18
for	18
they	18
are	18
always	18
wandering	18
among	18
woods,	18
forests	18
and	18
meadows,	18
mountains	18
and	18
crags,	18
without	18
a	18
drop	18
of	18
wine	18
to	18
be	18
had	18
if	18
they	18
gave	18
their	18
eyes	18
for	18
it.”	18
“So	18
I	18
believe,”	18
said	18
the	18
duchess;	18
“and	18
now	18
let	18
Sancho	18
go	18
and	18
take	18
his	18
sleep,	18
and	18
we	18
will	18
talk	18
by-and-by	18
at	18
greater	18
length,	18
and	18
settle	18
how	18
he	18
may	18
soon	18
go	18
and	18
stick	18
himself	18
into	18
the	18
government,	18
as	18
he	18
says.”	18
Sancho	18
once	18
more	18
kissed	18
the	18
duchess’s	18
hand,	18
and	18
entreated	18
her	18
to	18
let	18
good	18
care	18
be	18
taken	18
of	18
his	18
Dapple,	18
for	18
he	18
was	18
the	18
light	18
of	18
his	18
eyes.	18
“What	18
is	18
Dapple?”	18
said	18
the	18
duchess.	18
“My	18
ass,”	18
said	18
Sancho,	18
“which,	18
not	18
to	18
mention	18
him	18
by	18
that	18
name,	18
I’m	18
accustomed	18
to	18
call	18
Dapple;	18
I	18
begged	18
this	18
lady	18
duenna	18
here	18
to	18
take	18
care	18
of	18
him	18
when	18
I	18
came	18
into	18
the	18
castle,	18
and	18
she	18
got	18
as	18
angry	18
as	18
if	18
I	18
had	18
said	18
she	18
was	18
ugly	18
or	18
old,	18
though	18
it	18
ought	18
to	18
be	18
more	18
natural	18
and	18
proper	18
for	18
duennas	18
to	18
feed	18
asses	18
than	18
to	18
ornament	18
chambers.	18
God	18
bless	18
me!	18
what	18
a	18
spite	18
a	18
gentleman	18
of	18
my	18
village	18
had	18
against	18
these	18
ladies!”	18
“He	18
must	18
have	18
been	18
some	18
clown,”	18
said	18
Doña	18
Rodriguez	18
the	18
duenna;	18
“for	18
if	18
he	18
had	18
been	18
a	18
gentleman	18
and	18
well-born	18
he	18
would	18
have	18
exalted	18
them	18
higher	18
than	18
the	18
horns	18
of	18
the	18
moon.”	18
“That	18
will	18
do,”	18
said	18
the	18
duchess;	18
“no	18
more	18
of	18
this;	18
hush,	18
Doña	18
Rodriguez,	18
and	18
let	18
Señor	18
Panza	18
rest	18
easy	18
and	18
leave	18
the	18
treatment	18
of	18
Dapple	18
in	18
my	18
charge,	18
for	18
as	18
he	18
is	18
a	18
treasure	18
of	18
Sancho’s,	18
I’ll	18
put	18
him	18
on	18
the	18
apple	18
of	18
my	18
eye.”	18
“It	18
will	18
be	18
enough	18
for	18
him	18
to	18
be	18
in	18
the	18
stable,”	18
said	18
Sancho,	18
“for	18
neither	18
he	18
nor	18
I	18
are	18
worthy	18
to	18
rest	18
a	18
moment	18
in	18
the	18
apple	18
of	18
your	18
highness’s	18
eye,	18
and	18
I’d	18
as	18
soon	18
stab	18
myself	18
as	18
consent	18
to	18
it;	18
for	18
though	18
my	18
master	18
says	18
that	18
in	18
civilities	18
it	18
is	18
better	18
to	18
lose	18
by	18
a	18
card	18
too	18
many	18
than	18
a	18
card	18
too	18
few,	18
when	18
it	18
comes	18
to	18
civilities	18
to	18
asses	18
we	18
must	18
mind	18
what	18
we	18
are	18
about	18
and	18
keep	18
within	18
due	18
bounds.”	18
“Take	18
him	18
to	18
your	18
government,	18
Sancho,”	18
said	18
the	18
duchess,	18
“and	18
there	18
you	18
will	18
be	18
able	18
to	18
make	18
as	18
much	18
of	18
him	18
as	18
you	18
like,	18
and	18
even	18
release	18
him	18
from	18
work	18
and	18
pension	18
him	18
off.”	18
“Don’t	18
think,	18
señora	18
duchess,	18
that	18
you	18
have	18
said	18
anything	18
absurd,”	18
said	18
Sancho;	18
“I	18
have	18
seen	18
more	18
than	18
two	18
asses	18
go	18
to	18
governments,	18
and	18
for	18
me	18
to	18
take	18
mine	18
with	18
me	18
would	18
be	18
nothing	18
new.”	18
Sancho’s	18
words	18
made	18
the	18
duchess	18
laugh	18
again	18
and	18
gave	18
her	18
fresh	18
amusement,	18
and	18
dismissing	18
him	18
to	18
sleep	18
she	18
went	18
away	18
to	18
tell	18
the	18
duke	18
the	18
conversation	18
she	18
had	19
with	19
him,	19
and	19
between	19
them	19
they	19
plotted	19
and	19
arranged	19
to	19
play	19
a	19
joke	19
upon	19
Don	19
Quixote	19
that	19
was	19
to	19
be	19
a	19
rare	19
one	19
and	19
entirely	19
in	19
knight-errantry	19
style,	19
and	19
in	19
that	19
same	19
style	19
they	19
practised	19
several	19
upon	19
him,	19
so	19
much	19
in	19
keeping	19
and	19
so	19
clever	19
that	19
they	19
form	19
the	19
best	19
adventures	19
this	19
great	19
history	19
contains.	19

Great	19
was	19
the	19
pleasure	19
the	19
duke	19
and	19
duchess	19
took	19
in	19
the	19
conversation	19
of	19
Don	19
Quixote	19
and	19
Sancho	19
Panza;	19
and,	19
more	19
bent	19
than	19
ever	19
upon	19
the	19
plan	19
they	19
had	19
of	19
practising	19
some	19
jokes	19
upon	19
them	19
that	19
should	19
have	19
the	19
look	19
and	19
appearance	19
of	19
adventures,	19
they	19
took	19
as	19
their	19
basis	19
of	19
action	19
what	19
Don	19
Quixote	19
had	19
already	19
told	19
them	19
about	19
the	19
cave	19
of	19
Montesinos,	19
in	19
order	19
to	19
play	19
him	19
a	19
famous	19
one.	19
But	19
what	19
the	19
duchess	19
marvelled	19
at	19
above	19
all	19
was	19
that	19
Sancho’s	19
simplicity	19
could	19
be	19
so	19
great	19
as	19
to	19
make	19
him	19
believe	19
as	19
absolute	19
truth	19
that	19
Dulcinea	19
had	19
been	19
enchanted,	19
when	19
it	19
was	19
he	19
himself	19
who	19
had	19
been	19
the	19
enchanter	19
and	19
trickster	19
in	19
the	19
business.	19
Having,	19
therefore,	19
instructed	19
their	19
servants	19
in	19
everything	19
they	19
were	19
to	19
do,	19
six	19
days	19
afterwards	19
they	19
took	19
him	19
out	19
to	19
hunt,	19
with	19
as	19
great	19
a	19
retinue	19
of	19
huntsmen	19
and	19
beaters	19
as	19
a	19
crowned	19
king.	19
They	19
presented	19
Don	19
Quixote	19
with	19
a	19
hunting	19
suit,	19
and	19
Sancho	19
with	19
another	19
of	19
the	19
finest	19
green	19
cloth;	19
but	19
Don	19
Quixote	19
declined	19
to	19
put	19
his	19
on,	19
saying	19
that	19
he	19
must	19
soon	19
return	19
to	19
the	19
hard	19
pursuit	19
of	19
arms,	19
and	19
could	19
not	19
carry	19
wardrobes	19
or	19
stores	19
with	19
him.	19
Sancho,	19
however,	19
took	19
what	19
they	19
gave	19
him,	19
meaning	19
to	19
sell	19
it	19
at	19
the	19
first	19
opportunity.	19
The	19
appointed	19
day	19
having	19
arrived,	19
Don	19
Quixote	19
armed	19
himself,	19
and	19
Sancho	19
arrayed	19
himself,	19
and	19
mounted	19
on	19
his	19
Dapple	19
(for	19
he	19
would	19
not	19
give	19
him	19
up	19
though	19
they	19
offered	19
him	19
a	19
horse),	19
he	19
placed	19
himself	19
in	19
the	19
midst	19
of	19
the	19
troop	19
of	19
huntsmen.	19
The	19
duchess	19
came	19
out	19
splendidly	19
attired,	19
and	19
Don	19
Quixote,	19
in	19
pure	19
courtesy	19
and	19
politeness,	19
held	19
the	19
rein	19
of	19
her	19
palfrey,	19
though	19
the	19
duke	19
wanted	19
not	19
to	19
allow	19
him;	19
and	19
at	19
last	19
they	19
reached	19
a	19
wood	19
that	19
lay	19
between	19
two	19
high	19
mountains,	19
where,	19
after	19
occupying	19
various	19
posts,	19
ambushes,	19
and	19
paths,	19
and	19
distributing	19
the	19
party	19
in	19
different	19
positions,	19
the	19
hunt	19
began	19
with	19
great	19
noise,	19
shouting,	19
and	19
hallooing,	19
so	19
that,	19
between	19
the	19
baying	19
of	19
the	19
hounds	19
and	19
the	19
blowing	19
of	19
the	19
horns,	19
they	19
could	19
not	19
hear	19
one	19
another.	19
The	19
duchess	19
dismounted,	19
and	19
with	19
a	19
sharp	19
boar-spear	19
in	19
her	19
hand	19
posted	19
herself	19
where	19
she	19
knew	19
the	19
wild	19
boars	19
were	19
in	19
the	19
habit	19
of	19
passing.	19
The	19
duke	19
and	19
Don	19
Quixote	19
likewise	19
dismounted	19
and	19
placed	19
themselves	19
one	19
at	19
each	19
side	19
of	19
her.	19
Sancho	19
took	19
up	19
a	19
position	19
in	19
the	19
rear	19
of	19
all	19
without	19
dismounting	19
from	19
Dapple,	19
whom	19
he	19
dared	19
not	19
desert	19
lest	19
some	19
mischief	19
should	19
befall	19
him.	19
Scarcely	19
had	19
they	19
taken	19
their	19
stand	19
in	19
a	19
line	19
with	19
several	19
of	19
their	19
servants,	19
when	19
they	19
saw	19
a	19
huge	19
boar,	19
closely	19
pressed	19
by	19
the	19
hounds	19
and	19
followed	19
by	19
the	19
huntsmen,	19
making	19
towards	19
them,	19
grinding	19
his	19
teeth	19
and	19
tusks,	19
and	19
scattering	19
foam	19
from	19
his	19
mouth.	19
As	19
soon	19
as	19
he	19
saw	19
him	19
Don	19
Quixote,	19
bracing	19
his	19
shield	19
on	19
his	19
arm,	19
and	19
drawing	19
his	19
sword,	19
advanced	19
to	19
meet	19
him;	19
the	19
duke	19
with	19
boar-spear	19
did	19
the	19
same;	19
but	19
the	19
duchess	19
would	19
have	19
gone	19
in	19
front	19
of	19
them	19
all	19
had	19
not	19
the	19
duke	19
prevented	19
her.	19
Sancho	19
alone,	19
deserting	19
Dapple	19
at	19
the	19
sight	19
of	19
the	19
mighty	19
beast,	19
took	19
to	19
his	19
heels	19
as	19
hard	19
as	19
he	19
could	19
and	19
strove	19
in	19
vain	19
to	19
mount	19
a	19
tall	19
oak.	19
As	19
he	19
was	19
clinging	19
to	19
a	19
branch,	19
however,	19
half-way	19
up	19
in	19
his	19
struggle	19
to	19
reach	19
the	19
top,	19
the	19
bough,	19
such	19
was	19
his	19
ill-luck	19
and	19
hard	19
fate,	19
gave	19
way,	19
and	19
caught	19
in	19
his	19
fall	19
by	19
a	19
broken	19
limb	19
of	19
the	19
oak,	19
he	19
hung	19
suspended	19
in	19
the	19
air	19
unable	19
to	19
reach	19
the	19
ground.	19
Finding	19
himself	19
in	19
this	19
position,	19
and	19
that	19
the	19
green	19
coat	19
was	19
beginning	19
to	19
tear,	19
and	19
reflecting	19
that	19
if	19
the	19
fierce	19
animal	19
came	19
that	19
way	19
he	19
might	19
be	19
able	19
to	19
get	19
at	19
him,	19
he	19
began	19
to	19
utter	19
such	19
cries,	19
and	19
call	19
for	19
help	19
so	19
earnestly,	19
that	19
all	19
who	19
heard	19
him	19
and	19
did	19
not	19
see	19
him	19
felt	19
sure	19
he	19
must	19
be	19
in	19
the	19
teeth	19
of	19
some	19
wild	19
beast.	19
In	19
the	19
end	19
the	19
tusked	19
boar	19
fell	19
pierced	19
by	19
the	19
blades	19
of	19
the	19
many	19
spears	19
they	19
held	19
in	19
front	19
of	19
him;	19
and	19
Don	19
Quixote,	19
turning	19
round	19
at	19
the	19
cries	19
of	19
Sancho,	19
for	19
he	19
knew	19
by	19
them	19
that	19
it	19
was	19
he,	19
saw	19
him	19
hanging	19
from	19
the	19
oak	19
head	19
downwards,	19
with	19
Dapple,	19
who	19
did	19
not	19
forsake	19
him	19
in	19
his	19
distress,	19
close	19
beside	19
him;	19
and	19
Cide	19
Hamete	19
observes	19
that	19
he	19
seldom	19
saw	19
Sancho	19
Panza	19
without	19
seeing	19
Dapple,	19
or	19
Dapple	19
without	19
seeing	19
Sancho	19
Panza;	19
such	19
was	19
their	19
attachment	19
and	19
loyalty	19
one	19
to	19
the	19
other.	19
Don	19
Quixote	19
went	19
over	19
and	19
unhooked	19
Sancho,	19
who,	19
as	19
soon	19
as	19
he	19
found	19
himself	19
on	19
the	19
ground,	19
looked	19
at	19
the	19
rent	19
in	19
his	19
huntingcoat	19
and	19
was	19
grieved	19
to	19
the	19
heart,	19
for	19
he	19
thought	19
he	19
had	19
got	19
a	19
patrimonial	19
estate	19
in	19
that	19
suit.	19
Meanwhile	19
they	19
had	19
slung	19
the	19
mighty	19
boar	19
across	19
the	19
back	19
of	19
a	19
mule,	19
and	19
having	19
covered	19
it	19
with	19
sprigs	19
of	19
rosemary	19
and	19
branches	19
of	19
myrtle,	19
they	19
bore	19
it	19
away	19
as	19
the	19
spoils	19
of	19
victory	19
to	19
some	19
large	19
field-tents	19
which	19
had	19
been	19
pitched	19
in	19
the	19
middle	19
of	19
the	19
wood,	19
where	19
they	19
found	19
the	19
tables	19
laid	19
and	19
dinner	19
served,	19
in	19
such	19
grand	19
and	19
sumptuous	19
style	19
that	19
it	19
was	19
easy	19
to	19
see	19
the	19
rank	19
and	19
magnificence	19
of	19
those	19
who	19
had	19
provided	19
it.	19
Sancho,	19
as	19
he	19
showed	19
the	19
rents	19
in	19
his	19
torn	19
suit	19
to	19
the	19
duchess,	19
observed,	19
“If	19
we	19
had	19
been	19
hunting	19
hares,	19
or	19
after	19
small	19
birds,	19
my	19
coat	19
would	19
have	19
been	19
safe	19
from	19
being	19
in	19
the	19
plight	19
it’s	19
in;	19
I	19
don’t	19
know	19
what	19
pleasure	19
one	19
can	19
find	19
in	19
lying	19
in	19
wait	19
for	19
an	19
animal	19
that	19
may	19
take	19
your	19
life	19
with	19
his	19
tusk	19
if	19
he	19
gets	19
at	19
you.	19
I	19
recollect	19
having	19
heard	19
an	19
old	19
ballad	19
sung	19
that	19
says,	19
By	19
bears	19
be	19
thou	19
devoured,	19
as	19
erst	19
Was	19
famous	19
Favila.”	19
“That,”	19
said	19
Don	19
Quixote,	19
“was	19
a	19
Gothic	19
king,	19
who,	19
going	19
a-hunting,	19
was	19
devoured	19
by	19
a	19
bear.”	19
“Just	19
so,”	19
said	19
Sancho;	19
“and	19
I	19
would	19
not	19
have	19
kings	19
and	19
princes	19
expose	19
themselves	19
to	19
such	19
dangers	19
for	19
the	19
sake	19
of	19
a	19
pleasure	19
which,	19
to	19
my	19
mind,	19
ought	19
not	19
to	19
be	19
one,	19
as	19
it	19
consists	19
in	19
killing	19
an	19
animal	19
that	19
has	19
done	19
no	19
harm	19
whatever.”	19
“Quite	19
the	19
contrary,	19
Sancho;	19
you	19
are	19
wrong	19
there,”	19
said	19
the	19
duke;	19
“for	19
hunting	19
is	19
more	19
suitable	19
and	19
requisite	19
for	19
kings	19
and	19
princes	19
than	19
for	19
anybody	19
else.	19
The	19
chase	19
is	19
the	19
emblem	19
of	19
war;	19
it	19
has	19
stratagems,	19
wiles,	19
and	19
crafty	19
devices	19
for	19
overcoming	19
the	19
enemy	19
in	19
safety;	19
in	19
it	19
extreme	19
cold	19
and	19
intolerable	19
heat	19
have	19
to	19
be	19
borne,	19
indolence	19
and	19
sleep	19
are	19
despised,	19
the	19
bodily	19
powers	19
are	19
invigorated,	19
the	19
limbs	19
of	19
him	19
who	19
engages	19
in	19
it	19
are	19
made	19
supple,	19
and,	19
in	19
a	19
word,	19
it	19
is	19
a	19
pursuit	19
which	19
may	19
be	19
followed	19
without	19
injury	19
to	19
anyone	19
and	19
with	19
enjoyment	19
to	19
many;	19
and	19
the	19
best	19
of	19
it	19
is,	19
it	19
is	19
not	19
for	19
everybody,	19
as	19
field-sports	19
of	19
other	19
sorts	19
are,	19
except	19
hawking,	19
which	19
also	19
is	19
only	19
for	19
kings	19
and	19
great	19
lords.	19
Reconsider	19
your	19
opinion	19
therefore,	19
Sancho,	19
and	19
when	19
you	19
are	19
governor	19
take	19
to	19
hunting,	19
and	19
you	19
will	19
find	19
the	19
good	19
of	19
it.”	19
“Nay,”	19
said	19
Sancho,	19
“the	19
good	19
governor	19
should	19
have	19
a	19
broken	19
leg	19
and	19
keep	19
at	19
home;”	19
it	19
would	19
be	19
a	19
nice	19
thing	19
if,	19
after	19
people	19
had	19
been	19
at	19
the	19
trouble	19
of	19
coming	19
to	19
look	19
for	19
him	19
on	19
business,	19
the	19
governor	19
were	19
to	19
be	19
away	19
in	19
the	19
forest	19
enjoying	19
himself;	19
the	19
government	19
would	19
go	19
on	19
badly	19
in	19
that	19
fashion.	19
By	19
my	19
faith,	19
señor,	19
hunting	19
and	19
amusements	19
are	19
more	19
fit	19
for	19
idlers	19
than	19
for	19
governors;	19
what	19
I	19
intend	19
to	19
amuse	19
myself	19
with	19
is	19
playing	19
all	19
fours	19
at	19
Eastertime,	19
and	19
bowls	19
on	19
Sundays	19
and	19
holidays;	19
for	19
these	19
huntings	19
don’t	19
suit	19
my	19
condition	19
or	19
agree	19
with	19
my	19
conscience.”	19
“God	19
grant	19
it	19
may	19
turn	19
out	19
so,”	19
said	19
the	19
duke;	19
“because	19
it’s	19
a	19
long	19
step	19
from	19
saying	19
to	19
doing.”	19
“Be	19
that	19
as	19
it	19
may,”	19
said	19
Sancho,	19
“‘pledges	19
don’t	19
distress	19
a	19
good	19
payer,’	19
and	19
‘he	19
whom	19
God	19
helps	19
does	19
better	19
than	19
he	19
who	19
gets	19
up	19
early,’	19
and	19
‘it’s	19
the	19
tripes	19
that	19
carry	19
the	19
feet	19
and	19
not	19
the	19
feet	19
the	19
tripes;’	19
I	19
mean	19
to	19
say	19
that	19
if	19
God	19
gives	19
me	19
help	19
and	19
I	19
do	19
my	19
duty	19
honestly,	19
no	19
doubt	19
I’ll	19
govern	19
better	19
than	19
a	19
gerfalcon.	19
Nay,	19
let	19
them	19
only	19
put	19
a	19
finger	19
in	19
my	19
mouth,	19
and	19
they’ll	19
see	19
whether	19
I	19
can	19
bite	19
or	19
not.”	19
“The	19
curse	19
of	19
God	19
and	19
all	19
his	19
saints	19
upon	19
thee,	19
thou	19
accursed	19
Sancho!”	19
exclaimed	19
Don	19
Quixote;	19
“when	19
will	19
the	19
day	19
come—as	19
I	19
have	19
often	19
said	19
to	19
thee—when	19
I	19
shall	19
hear	19
thee	19
make	19
one	19
single	19
coherent,	19
rational	19
remark	19
without	19
proverbs?	19
Pray,	19
your	19
highnesses,	19
leave	19
this	19
fool	19
alone,	19
for	19
he	19
will	19
grind	19
your	19
souls	19
between,	19
not	19
to	19
say	19
two,	19
but	19
two	19
thousand	19
proverbs,	19
dragged	19
in	19
as	19
much	19
in	19
season,	19
and	19
as	19
much	19
to	19
the	19
purpose	19
as—may	19
God	19
grant	19
as	19
much	19
health	19
to	19
him,	19
or	19
to	19
me	19
if	19
I	19
want	19
to	19
listen	19
to	19
them!”	19
“Sancho	19
Panza’s	19
proverbs,”	19
said	19
the	19
duchess,	19
“though	19
more	19
in	19
number	19
than	19
the	19
Greek	19
Commander’s,	19
are	19
not	19
therefore	19
less	19
to	19
be	19
esteemed	19
for	19
the	19
conciseness	19
of	19
the	19
maxims.	19
For	19
my	19
own	19
part,	19
I	19
can	19
say	19
they	19
give	19
me	19
more	19
pleasure	19
than	19
others	19
that	19
may	19
be	19
better	19
brought	19
in	19
and	19
more	19
seasonably	19
introduced.”	19
In	19
pleasant	19
conversation	19
of	19
this	19
sort	19
they	19
passed	19
out	19
of	19
the	19
tent	19
into	19
the	19
wood,	19
and	19
the	19
day	19
was	19
spent	19
in	19
visiting	19
some	19
of	19
the	19
posts	19
and	19
hiding-places,	19
and	19
then	19
night	19
closed	19
in,	19
not,	19
however,	19
as	19
brilliantly	19
or	19
tranquilly	19
as	19
might	19
have	19
been	19
expected	19
at	19
the	19
season,	19
for	19
it	19
was	19
then	19
midsummer;	19
but	19
bringing	19
with	19
it	19
a	19
kind	19
of	19
haze	19
that	19
greatly	19
aided	19
the	19
project	19
of	19
the	19
duke	19
and	19
duchess;	19
and	19
thus,	19
as	19
night	19
began	19
to	19
fall,	19
and	19
a	19
little	19
after	19
twilight	19
set	19
in,	19
suddenly	19
the	19
whole	19
wood	19
on	19
all	19
four	19
sides	19
seemed	19
to	19
be	19
on	19
fire,	19
and	19
shortly	19
after,	19
here,	19
there,	19
on	19
all	19
sides,	19
a	19
vast	19
number	19
of	19
trumpets	19
and	19
other	19
military	19
instruments	19
were	19
heard,	19
as	19
if	19
several	19
troops	19
of	19
cavalry	19
were	19
passing	19
through	19
the	19
wood.	19
The	19
blaze	19
of	19
the	19
fire	19
and	19
the	19
noise	19
of	19
the	19
warlike	19
instruments	19
almost	19
blinded	19
the	19
eyes	19
and	19
deafened	19
the	19
ears	19
of	19
those	19
that	19
stood	19
by,	19
and	19
indeed	19
of	19
all	19
who	19
were	19
in	19
the	19
wood.	19
Then	19
there	19
were	19
heard	19
repeated	19
lelilies	19
after	19
the	19
fashion	19
of	19
the	19
Moors	19
when	19
they	19
rush	19
to	19
battle;	19
trumpets	19
and	19
clarions	19
brayed,	19
drums	19
beat,	19
fifes	19
played,	19
so	19
unceasingly	19
and	19
so	19
fast	19
that	19
he	19
could	19
not	19
have	19
had	19
any	19
senses	19
who	19
did	19
not	19
lose	19
them	19
with	19
the	19
confused	19
din	19
of	19
so	19
many	19
instruments.	19
The	19
duke	19
was	19
astounded,	19
the	19
duchess	19
amazed,	19
Don	19
Quixote	19
wondering,	19
Sancho	19
Panza	19
trembling,	19
and	19
indeed,	19
even	19
they	19
who	19
were	19
aware	19
of	19
the	19
cause	19
were	19
frightened.	19
In	19
their	19
fear,	19
silence	19
fell	19
upon	19
them,	19
and	19
a	19
postillion,	19
in	19
the	19
guise	19
of	19
a	19
demon,	19
passed	19
in	19
front	19
of	19
them,	19
blowing,	19
in	19
lieu	19
of	19
a	19
bugle,	19
a	19
huge	19
hollow	19
horn	19
that	19
gave	19
out	19
a	19
horrible	19
hoarse	19
note.	19
“Ho	19
there!	19
brother	19
courier,”	19
cried	19
the	19
duke,	19
“who	19
are	19
you?	19
Where	19
are	19
you	19
going?	19
What	19
troops	19
are	19
these	19
that	19
seem	19
to	19
be	19
passing	19
through	19
the	19
wood?”	19
To	19
which	19
the	19
courier	19
replied	19
in	19
a	19
harsh,	19
discordant	19
voice,	19
“I	19
am	19
the	19
devil;	19
I	19
am	19
in	19
search	19
of	19
Don	19
Quixote	19
of	19
La	19
Mancha;	19
those	19
who	19
are	19
coming	19
this	19
way	19
are	19
six	19
troops	19
of	19
enchanters,	19
who	19
are	19
bringing	19
on	19
a	19
triumphal	19
car	19
the	19
peerless	19
Dulcinea	19
del	19
Toboso;	19
she	19
comes	19
under	19
enchantment,	19
together	19
with	19
the	19
gallant	19
Frenchman	19
Montesinos,	19
to	19
give	19
instructions	19
to	19
Don	19
Quixote	19
as	19
to	19
how,	19
she	19
the	19
said	19
lady,	19
may	19
be	19
disenchanted.”	19
“If	19
you	19
were	19
the	19
devil,	19
as	19
you	19
say	19
and	19
as	19
your	19
appearance	19
indicates,”	19
said	19
the	19
duke,	19
“you	19
would	19
have	19
known	19
the	19
said	19
knight	19
Don	19
Quixote	19
of	19
La	19
Mancha,	19
for	19
you	19
have	19
him	19
here	19
before	19
you.”	19
“By	19
God	19
and	19
upon	19
my	19
conscience,”	19
said	19
the	19
devil,	19
“I	19
never	19
observed	19
it,	19
for	19
my	19
mind	19
is	19
occupied	19
with	19
so	19
many	19
different	19
things	19
that	19
I	19
was	19
forgetting	19
the	19
main	19
thing	19
I	19
came	19
about.”	19
“This	19
demon	19
must	19
be	19
an	19
honest	19
fellow	19
and	19
a	19
good	19
Christian,”	19
said	19
Sancho;	19
“for	19
if	19
he	19
wasn’t	19
he	19
wouldn’t	19
swear	19
by	19
God	19
and	19
his	19
conscience;	19
I	19
feel	19
sure	19
now	19
there	19
must	19
be	19
good	19
souls	19
even	19
in	19
hell	19
itself.”	19
Without	19
dismounting,	19
the	19
demon	19
then	19
turned	19
to	19
Don	19
Quixote	19
and	19
said,	19
“The	19
unfortunate	19
but	19
valiant	19
knight	19
Montesinos	19
sends	19
me	19
to	19
thee,	19
the	19
Knight	19
of	19
the	19
Lions	19
(would	19
that	19
I	19
saw	19
thee	19
in	19
their	19
claws),	19
bidding	19
me	19
tell	19
thee	19
to	19
wait	19
for	19
him	19
wherever	19
I	19
may	19
find	19
thee,	19
as	19
he	19
brings	19
with	19
him	19
her	19
whom	19
they	19
call	19
Dulcinea	19
del	19
Toboso,	19
that	19
he	19
may	19
show	19
thee	19
what	19
is	19
needful	19
in	19
order	19
to	19
disenchant	19
her;	19
and	19
as	19
I	19
came	19
for	19
no	19
more	19
I	19
need	19
stay	19
no	19
longer;	19
demons	19
of	19
my	19
sort	19
be	19
with	19
thee,	19
and	19
good	19
angels	19
with	19
these	19
gentles;”	19
and	19
so	19
saying	19
he	19
blew	19
his	19
huge	19
horn,	19
turned	19
about	19
and	19
went	19
off	19
without	19
waiting	19
for	19
a	19
reply	19
from	19
anyone.	19
They	19
all	19
felt	19
fresh	19
wonder,	19
but	19
particularly	19
Sancho	19
and	19
Don	19
Quixote;	19
Sancho	19
to	19
see	19
how,	19
in	19
defiance	19
of	19
the	19
truth,	19
they	19
would	19
have	19
it	19
that	19
Dulcinea	19
was	19
enchanted;	19
Don	19
Quixote	19
because	19
he	19
could	19
not	19
feel	19
sure	19
whether	19
what	19
had	19
happened	19
to	19
him	19
in	19
the	19
cave	19
of	19
Montesinos	19
was	19
true	19
or	19
not;	19
and	19
as	19
he	19
was	19
deep	19
in	19
these	19
cogitations	19
the	19
duke	19
said	19
to	19
him,	19
“Do	19
you	19
mean	19
to	19
wait,	19
Señor	19
Don	19
Quixote?”	19
“Why	19
not?”	19
replied	19
he;	19
“here	19
will	19
I	19
wait,	19
fearless	19
and	19
firm,	19
though	19
all	19
hell	19
should	19
come	19
to	19
attack	19
me.”	19
“Well	19
then,	19
if	19
I	19
see	19
another	19
devil	19
or	19
hear	19
another	19
horn	19
like	19
the	19
last,	19
I’ll	19
wait	19
here	19
as	19
much	19
as	19
in	19
Flanders,”	19
said	19
Sancho.	19
Night	19
now	19
closed	19
in	19
more	19
completely,	19
and	19
many	19
lights	19
began	19
to	19
flit	19
through	19
the	19
wood,	19
just	19
as	19
those	19
fiery	19
exhalations	19
from	19
the	19
earth,	19
that	19
look	19
like	19
shooting-stars	19
to	19
our	19
eyes,	19
flit	19
through	19
the	19
heavens;	19
a	19
frightful	19
noise,	19
too,	19
was	19
heard,	19
like	19
that	19
made	19
by	19
the	19
solid	19
wheels	19
the	19
ox-carts	19
usually	19
have,	19
by	19
the	19
harsh,	19
ceaseless	19
creaking	19
of	19
which,	19
they	19
say,	19
the	19
bears	19
and	19
wolves	19
are	19
put	19
to	19
flight,	19
if	19
there	19
happen	19
to	19
be	19
any	19
where	19
they	19
are	19
passing.	19
In	19
addition	19
to	19
all	19
this	19
commotion,	19
there	19
came	19
a	19
further	19
disturbance	19
to	19
increase	19
the	19
tumult,	19
for	19
now	19
it	19
seemed	19
as	19
if	19
in	19
truth,	19
on	19
all	19
four	19
sides	19
of	19
the	19
wood,	19
four	19
encounters	19
or	19
battles	19
were	19
going	19
on	19
at	19
the	19
same	19
time;	19
in	19
one	19
quarter	19
resounded	19
the	19
dull	19
noise	19
of	19
a	19
terrible	19
cannonade,	19
in	19
another	19
numberless	19
muskets	19
were	19
being	19
discharged,	19
the	19
shouts	19
of	19
the	19
combatants	19
sounded	19
almost	19
close	19
at	19
hand,	19
and	19
farther	19
away	19
the	19
Moorish	19
lelilies	19
were	19
raised	19
again	19
and	19
again.	19
In	19
a	19
word,	19
the	19
bugles,	19
the	19
horns,	19
the	19
clarions,	19
the	19
trumpets,	19
the	19
drums,	19
the	19
cannon,	19
the	19
musketry,	19
and	19
above	19
all	19
the	19
tremendous	19
noise	19
of	19
the	19
carts,	19
all	19
made	19
up	19
together	19
a	19
din	19
so	19
confused	19
and	19
terrific	19
that	19
Don	19
Quixote	19
had	19
need	19
to	19
summon	19
up	19
all	19
his	19
courage	19
to	19
brave	19
it;	19
but	19
Sancho’s	19
gave	19
way,	19
and	19
he	19
fell	19
fainting	19
on	19
the	19
skirt	19
of	19
the	19
duchess’s	19
robe,	19
who	19
let	19
him	19
lie	19
there	19
and	19
promptly	19
bade	19
them	19
throw	19
water	19
in	19
his	19
face.	19
This	19
was	19
done,	19
and	19
he	19
came	19
to	19
himself	19
by	19
the	19
time	19
that	19
one	19
of	19
the	19
carts	19
with	19
the	19
creaking	19
wheels	19
reached	19
the	19
spot.	19
It	19
was	19
drawn	19
by	19
four	19
plodding	19
oxen	19
all	19
covered	19
with	19
black	19
housings;	19
on	19
each	19
horn	19
they	19
had	19
fixed	19
a	19
large	19
lighted	19
wax	19
taper,	19
and	19
on	19
the	19
top	19
of	19
the	19
cart	19
was	19
constructed	19
a	19
raised	19
seat,	19
on	19
which	19
sat	19
a	19
venerable	19
old	19
man	19
with	19
a	19
beard	19
whiter	19
than	19
the	19
very	19
snow,	19
and	19
so	19
long	19
that	19
it	19
fell	19
below	19
his	19
waist;	19
he	19
was	19
dressed	19
in	19
a	19
long	19
robe	19
of	19
black	19
buckram;	19
for	19
as	19
the	19
cart	19
was	19
thickly	19
set	19
with	19
a	19
multitude	19
of	19
candles	19
it	19
was	19
easy	19
to	19
make	19
out	19
everything	19
that	19
was	19
on	19
it.	19
Leading	19
it	19
were	19
two	19
hideous	19
demons,	19
also	19
clad	19
in	19
buckram,	19
with	19
countenances	19
so	19
frightful	19
that	19
Sancho,	19
having	19
once	19
seen	19
them,	19
shut	19
his	19
eyes	19
so	19
as	19
not	19
to	19
see	19
them	19
again.	19
As	19
soon	19
as	19
the	19
cart	19
came	19
opposite	19
the	19
spot	19
the	19
old	19
man	19
rose	19
from	19
his	19
lofty	19
seat,	19
and	19
standing	19
up	19
said	19
in	19
a	19
loud	19
voice,	19
“I	19
am	19
the	19
sage	19
Lirgandeo,”	19
and	19
without	19
another	19
word	19
the	19
cart	19
then	19
passed	19
on.	19
Behind	19
it	19
came	19
another	19
of	19
the	19
same	19
form,	19
with	19
another	19
aged	19
man	19
enthroned,	19
who,	19
stopping	19
the	19
cart,	19
said	19
in	19
a	19
voice	19
no	19
less	19
solemn	19
than	19
that	19
of	19
the	19
first,	19
“I	19
am	19
the	19
sage	19
Alquife,	19
the	19
great	19
friend	19
of	19
Urganda	19
the	19
Unknown,”	19
and	19
passed	19
on.	19
Then	19
another	19
cart	19
came	19
by	19
at	19
the	19
same	19
pace,	19
but	19
the	19
occupant	19
of	19
the	19
throne	19
was	19
not	19
old	19
like	19
the	19
others,	19
but	19
a	19
man	19
stalwart	19
and	19
robust,	19
and	19
of	19
a	19
forbidding	19
countenance,	19
who	19
as	19
he	19
came	19
up	19
said	19
in	19
a	19
voice	19
far	19
hoarser	19
and	19
more	19
devilish,	19
“I	19
am	19
the	19
enchanter	19
Archelaus,	19
the	19
mortal	19
enemy	19
of	19
Amadis	19
of	19
Gaul	19
and	19
all	19
his	19
kindred,”	19
and	19
then	19
passed	19
on.	19
Having	19
gone	19
a	19
short	19
distance	19
the	19
three	19
carts	19
halted	19
and	19
the	19
monotonous	19
noise	19
of	19
their	19
wheels	19
ceased,	19
and	19
soon	19
after	19
they	19
heard	19
another,	19
not	19
noise,	19
but	19
sound	19
of	19
sweet,	19
harmonious	19
music,	19
of	19
which	19
Sancho	19
was	19
very	19
glad,	19
taking	19
it	19
to	19
be	19
a	19
good	19
sign;	19
and	19
said	19
he	19
to	19
the	19
duchess,	19
from	19
whom	19
he	19
did	19
not	19
stir	19
a	19
step,	19
or	19
for	19
a	19
single	19
instant,	19
“Señora,	19
where	19
there’s	19
music	19
there	19
can’t	19
be	19
mischief.”	19
“Nor	19
where	19
there	19
are	19
lights	19
and	19
it	19
is	19
bright,”	19
said	19
the	19
duchess;	19
to	19
which	19
Sancho	19
replied,	19
“Fire	19
gives	19
light,	19
and	19
it’s	19
bright	19
where	19
there	19
are	19
bonfires,	19
as	19
we	19
see	19
by	19
those	19
that	19
are	19
all	19
round	19
us	19
and	19
perhaps	19
may	19
burn	19
us;	19
but	19
music	19
is	19
a	19
sign	19
of	19
mirth	19
and	19
merrymaking.”	19
“That	19
remains	19
to	19
be	19
seen,”	19
said	19
Don	19
Quixote,	19
who	19
was	19
listening	19
to	19
all	19
that	19
passed;	19
and	19
he	19
was	19
right,	19
as	19
is	19
shown	19
in	19
the	19
following	19

They	19
saw	19
advancing	19
towards	19
them,	19
to	19
the	19
sound	19
of	19
this	19
pleasing	19
music,	19
what	19
they	19
call	19
a	19
triumphal	19
car,	19
drawn	19
by	19
six	19
grey	19
mules	19
with	19
white	19
linen	19
housings,	19
on	19
each	19
of	19
which	19
was	19
mounted	19
a	19
penitent,	19
robed	19
also	19
in	19
white,	19
with	19
a	19
large	19
lighted	19
wax	19
taper	19
in	19
his	19
hand.	19
The	19
car	19
was	19
twice	19
or,	19
perhaps,	19
three	19
times	19
as	19
large	19
as	19
the	19
former	19
ones,	19
and	19
in	19
front	19
and	19
on	19
the	19
sides	19
stood	19
twelve	19
more	19
penitents,	19
all	19
as	19
white	19
as	19
snow	19
and	19
all	19
with	19
lighted	19
tapers,	19
a	19
spectacle	19
to	19
excite	19
fear	19
as	19
well	19
as	19
wonder;	19
and	19
on	19
a	19
raised	19
throne	19
was	19
seated	19
a	19
nymph	19
draped	19
in	19
a	19
multitude	19
of	19
silver-tissue	19
veils	19
with	19
an	19
embroidery	19
of	19
countless	19
gold	19
spangles	19
glittering	19
all	19
over	19
them,	19
that	19
made	19
her	19
appear,	19
if	19
not	19
richly,	19
at	19
least	19
brilliantly,	19
apparelled.	19
She	19
had	19
her	19
face	19
covered	19
with	19
thin	19
transparent	19
sendal,	19
the	19
texture	19
of	19
which	19
did	19
not	19
prevent	19
the	19
fair	19
features	19
of	19
a	19
maiden	19
from	19
being	19
distinguished,	19
while	19
the	19
numerous	19
lights	19
made	19
it	19
possible	19
to	19
judge	19
of	19
her	19
beauty	19
and	19
of	19
her	19
years,	19
which	19
seemed	19
to	19
be	19
not	19
less	19
than	19
seventeen	19
but	19
not	19
to	19
have	19
yet	19
reached	19
twenty.	19
Beside	19
her	19
was	19
a	19
figure	19
in	19
a	19
robe	19
of	19
state,	19
as	19
they	19
call	19
it,	19
reaching	19
to	19
the	19
feet,	19
while	19
the	19
head	19
was	19
covered	19
with	19
a	19
black	19
veil.	19
But	19
the	19
instant	19
the	19
car	19
was	19
opposite	19
the	19
duke	19
and	19
duchess	19
and	19
Don	19
Quixote	19
the	19
music	19
of	19
the	19
clarions	19
ceased,	19
and	19
then	19
that	19
of	19
the	19
lutes	19
and	19
harps	19
on	19
the	19
car,	19
and	19
the	19
figure	19
in	19
the	19
robe	19
rose	19
up,	19
and	19
flinging	19
it	19
apart	19
and	19
removing	19
the	19
veil	19
from	19
its	19
face,	19
disclosed	19
to	19
their	19
eyes	19
the	19
shape	19
of	19
Death	19
itself,	19
fleshless	19
and	19
hideous,	19
at	19
which	19
sight	19
Don	19
Quixote	19
felt	19
uneasy,	19
Sancho	19
frightened,	19
and	19
the	19
duke	19
and	19
duchess	19
displayed	19
a	19
certain	19
trepidation.	19
Having	19
risen	19

death,	19

hard	19
of	19
heart;	19
not	19
so	19
am	19
I;	19
For	19
mine	19
is	19
tender,	19
soft,	19
compassionate,	19
And	19
its	19
delight	19
is	19
doing	19
good	19
to	19
all.	19
In	19
the	19
dim	19
caverns	19
of	19
the	19
gloomy	19
Dis,	19
Where,	19
tracing	19
mystic	19
lines	19
and	19
characters,	19
My	19
soul	19
abideth	19
now,	19
there	19
came	19
to	19
me	19
The	19
sorrow-laden	19
plaint	19
of	19
her,	19
the	19
fair,	19
The	19
peerless	19
Dulcinea	19
del	19
Toboso.	19
I	19
knew	19
of	19
her	19
enchantment	19
and	19
her	19
fate,	19
From	19
high-born	19
dame	19
to	19
peasant	19
wench	19
transformed	19
And	19
touched	19
with	19
pity,	19
first	19
I	19
turned	19
the	19
leaves	19
Of	19
countless	19
volumes	19
of	19
my	19
devilish	19
craft,	19
And	19
then,	19
in	19
this	19
grim	19
grisly	19
skeleton	19
Myself	19
encasing,	19
hither	19
have	19
I	19
come	19
To	19
show	19
where	19
lies	19
the	19
fitting	19
remedy	19
To	19
give	19
relief	19
in	19
such	19
a	19
piteous	19
case.	19
O	19
thou,	19
the	19
pride	19
and	19
pink	19
of	19
all	19
that	19
I	19
wear	19
The	19
adamantine	19
steel!	19
O	19
shining	19
light,	19
O	19
beacon,	19
polestar,	19
path	19
and	19
guide	19
of	19
all	19
Who,	19
scorning	19
slumber	19
and	19
the	19
lazy	19
down,	19
Adopt	19
the	19
toilsome	19
life	19
of	19
bloodstained	19
arms!	19
To	19
thee,	19
great	19
hero	19
who	19
all	19
praise	19
transcends,	19
La	19
Mancha’s	19
lustre	19
and	19
Iberia’s	19
star,	19
Don	19
Quixote,	19
wise	19
as	19
brave,	19
to	19
thee	19
I	19
say—	19
For	19
peerless	19
Dulcinea	19
del	19
Toboso	19
Her	19
pristine	19
form	19
and	19
beauty	19
to	19
regain,	19
’Tis	19
needful	19
that	19
thy	19
esquire	19
Sancho	19
shall,	19
On	19
his	19
own	19
sturdy	19
buttocks	19
bared	19
to	19
heaven,	19
Three	19
thousand	19
and	19
three	19
hundred	19
lashes	19
lay,	19
And	19
that	19
they	19
smart	19
and	19
sting	19
and	19
hurt	19
him	19
well.	19
Thus	19
have	19
the	19
authors	19
of	19
her	19
woe	19
resolved.	19
And	19
this	19
is,	19
gentles,	19
wherefore	19
I	19
have	19
come.	19
“By	19
all	19
that’s	19
good,”	19
exclaimed	19
Sancho	19
at	19
this,	19
“I’ll	19
just	19
as	19
soon	19
give	19
myself	19
three	19
stabs	19
with	19
a	19
dagger	19
as	19
three,	19
not	19
to	19
say	19
three	19
thousand,	19
lashes.	19
The	19
devil	19
take	19
such	19
a	19
way	19
of	19
disenchanting!	19
I	19
don’t	19
see	19
what	19
my	19
backside	19
has	19
got	19
to	19
do	19
with	19
enchantments.	19
By	19
God,	19
if	19
Señor	19
Merlin	19
has	19
not	19
found	19
out	19
some	19
other	19
way	19
of	19
disenchanting	19
the	19
lady	19
Dulcinea	19
del	19
Toboso,	19
she	19
may	19
go	19
to	19
her	19
grave	19
enchanted.”	19
“But	19
I’ll	19
take	19
you,	19
Don	19
Clown	19
stuffed	19
with	19
garlic,”	19
said	19
Don	19
Quixote,	19
“and	19
tie	19
you	19
to	19
a	19
tree	19
as	19
naked	19
as	19
when	19
your	19
mother	19
brought	19
you	19
forth,	19
and	19
give	19
you,	19
not	19
to	19
say	19
three	19
thousand	19
three	19
hundred,	19
but	19
six	19
thousand	19
six	19
hundred	19
lashes,	19
and	19
so	19
well	19
laid	19
on	19
that	19
they	19
won’t	19
be	19
got	19
rid	19
of	19
if	19
you	19
try	19
three	19
thousand	19
three	19
hundred	19
times;	19
don’t	19
answer	19
me	19
a	19
word	19
or	19
I’ll	19
tear	19
your	19
soul	19
out.”	19
On	19
hearing	19
this	19
Merlin	19
said,	19
“That	19
will	19
not	19
do,	19
for	19
the	19
lashes	19
worthy	19
Sancho	19
has	19
to	19
receive	19
must	19
be	19
given	19
of	19
his	19
own	19
free	19
will	19
and	19
not	19
by	19
force,	19
and	19
at	19
whatever	19
time	19
he	19
pleases,	19
for	19
there	19
is	19
no	19
fixed	19
limit	19
assigned	19
to	19
him;	19
but	19
it	19
is	19
permitted	19
him,	19
if	19
he	19
likes	19
to	19
commute	19
by	19
half	19
the	19
pain	19
of	19
this	19
whipping,	19
to	19
let	19
them	19
be	19
given	19
by	19
the	19
hand	19
of	19
another,	19
though	19
it	19
may	19
be	19
somewhat	19
weighty.”	19
“Not	19
a	19
hand,	19
my	19
own	19
or	19
anybody	19
else’s,	19
weighty	19
or	19
weighable,	19
shall	19
touch	19
me,”	19
said	19
Sancho.	19
“Was	19
it	19
I	19
that	19
gave	19
birth	19
to	19
the	19
lady	19
Dulcinea	19
del	19
Toboso,	19
that	19
my	19
backside	19
is	19
to	19
pay	19
for	19
the	19
sins	19
of	19
her	19
eyes?	19
My	19
master,	19
indeed,	19
that’s	19
a	19
part	19
of	19
her—for,	19
he’s	19
always	19
calling	19
her	19
‘my	19
life’	19
and	19
‘my	19
soul,’	19
and	19
his	19
stay	19
and	19
prop—may	19
and	19
ought	19
to	19
whip	19
himself	19
for	19
her	19
and	19
take	19
all	19
the	19
trouble	19
required	19
for	19
her	19
disenchantment.	19
But	19
for	19
me	19
to	19
whip	19
myself!	19
Abernuncio!”	19
As	19
soon	19
as	19
Sancho	19
had	19
done	19
speaking	19
the	19
nymph	19
in	19
silver	19
that	19
was	19
at	19
the	19
side	19
of	19
Merlin’s	19
ghost	19
stood	19
up,	19
and	19
removing	19
the	19
thin	19
veil	19
from	19
her	19
face	19
disclosed	19
one	19
that	19
seemed	19
to	19
all	19
something	19
more	19
than	19
exceedingly	19
beautiful;	19
and	19
with	19
a	19
masculine	19
freedom	19
from	19
embarrassment	19
and	19
in	19
a	19
voice	19
not	19
very	19
like	19
a	19
lady’s,	19
addressing	19
Sancho	19
directly,	19
said,	19
“Thou	19
wretched	19
squire,	19
soul	19
of	19
a	19
pitcher,	19
heart	19
of	19
a	19
cork	19
tree,	19
with	19
bowels	19
of	19
flint	19
and	19
pebbles;	19
if,	19
thou	19
impudent	19
thief,	19
they	19
bade	19
thee	19
throw	19
thyself	19
down	19
from	19
some	19
lofty	19
tower;	19
if,	19
enemy	19
of	19
mankind,	19
they	19
asked	19
thee	19
to	19
swallow	19
a	19
dozen	19
of	19
toads,	19
two	19
of	19
lizards,	19
and	19
three	19
of	19
adders;	19
if	19
they	19
wanted	19
thee	19
to	19
slay	19
thy	19
wife	19
and	19
children	19
with	19
a	19
sharp	19
murderous	19
scimitar,	19
it	19
would	19
be	19
no	19
wonder	19
for	19
thee	19
to	19
show	19
thyself	19
stubborn	19
and	19
squeamish.	19
But	19
to	19
make	19
a	19
piece	19
of	19
work	19
about	19
three	19
thousand	19
three	19
hundred	19
lashes,	19
what	19
every	19
poor	19
little	19
charity-boy	19
gets	19
every	19
month—it	19
is	19
enough	19
to	19
amaze,	19
astonish,	19
astound	19
the	19
compassionate	19
bowels	19
of	19
all	19
who	19
hear	19
it,	19
nay,	19
all	19
who	19
come	19
to	19
hear	19
it	19
in	19
the	19
course	19
of	19
time.	19
Turn,	19
O	19
miserable,	19
hard-hearted	19
animal,	19
turn,	19
I	19
say,	19
those	19
timorous	19
owl’s	19
eyes	19
upon	19
these	19
of	19
mine	19
that	19
are	19
compared	19
to	19
radiant	19
stars,	19
and	19
thou	19
wilt	19
see	19
them	19
weeping	19
trickling	19
streams	19
and	19
rills,	19
and	19
tracing	19
furrows,	19
tracks,	19
and	19
paths	19
over	19
the	19
fair	19
fields	19
of	19
my	19
cheeks.	19
Let	19
it	19
move	19
thee,	19
crafty,	19
ill-conditioned	19
monster,	19
to	19
see	19
my	19
blooming	19
youth—still	19
in	19
its	19
teens,	19
for	19
I	19
am	19
not	19
yet	19
twenty—wasting	19
and	19
withering	19
away	19
beneath	19
the	19
husk	19
of	19
a	19
rude	19
peasant	19
wench;	19
and	19
if	19
I	19
do	19
not	19
appear	19
in	19
that	19
shape	19
now,	19
it	19
is	19
a	19
special	19
favour	19
Señor	19
Merlin	19
here	19
has	19
granted	19
me,	19
to	19
the	19
sole	19
end	19
that	19
my	19
beauty	19
may	19
soften	19
thee;	19
for	19
the	19
tears	19
of	19
beauty	19
in	19
distress	19
turn	19
rocks	19
into	19
cotton	19
and	19
tigers	19
into	19
ewes.	19
Lay	19
on	19
to	19
that	19
hide	19
of	19
thine,	19
thou	19
great	19
untamed	19
brute,	19
rouse	19
up	19
thy	19
lusty	19
vigour	19
that	19
only	19
urges	19
thee	19
to	19
eat	19
and	19
eat,	19
and	19
set	19
free	19
the	19
softness	19
of	19
my	19
flesh,	19
the	19
gentleness	19
of	19
my	19
nature,	19
and	19
the	19
fairness	19
of	19
my	19
face.	19
And	19
if	19
thou	19
wilt	19
not	19
relent	19
or	19
come	19
to	19
reason	19
for	19
me,	19
do	19
so	19
for	19
the	19
sake	19
of	19
that	19
poor	19
knight	19
thou	19
hast	19
beside	19
thee;	19
thy	19
master	19
I	19
mean,	19
whose	19
soul	19
I	19
can	19
this	19
moment	19
see,	19
how	19
he	19
has	19
it	19
stuck	19
in	19
his	19
throat	19
not	19
ten	19
fingers	19
from	19
his	19
lips,	19
and	19
only	19
waiting	19
for	19
thy	19
inflexible	19
or	19
yielding	19
reply	19
to	19
make	19
its	19
escape	19
by	19
his	19
mouth	19
or	19
go	19
back	19
again	19
into	19
his	19
stomach.”	19
Don	19
Quixote	19
on	19
hearing	19
this	19
felt	19
his	19
throat,	19
and	19
turning	19
to	19
the	19
duke	19
he	19
said,	19
“By	19
God,	19
señor,	19
Dulcinea	19
says	19
true,	19
I	19
have	19
my	19
soul	19
stuck	19
here	19
in	19
my	19
throat	19
like	19
the	19
nut	19
of	19
a	19
crossbow.”	19
“What	19
say	19
you	19
to	19
this,	19
Sancho?”	19
said	19
the	19
duchess.	19
“I	19
say,	19
señora,”	19
returned	19
Sancho,	19
“what	19
I	19
said	19
before;	19
as	19
for	19
the	19
lashes,	19
abernuncio!”	19
“Abrenuncio,	19
you	19
should	19
say,	19
Sancho,	19
and	19
not	19
as	19
you	19
do,”	19
said	19
the	19
duke.	19
“Let	19
me	19
alone,	19
your	19
highness,”	19
said	19
Sancho.	19
“I’m	19
not	19
in	19
a	19
humour	19
now	19
to	19
look	19
into	19
niceties	19
or	19
a	19
letter	19
more	19
or	19
less,	19
for	19
these	19
lashes	19
that	19
are	19
to	19
be	19
given	19
me,	19
or	19
I’m	19
to	19
give	19
myself,	19
have	19
so	19
upset	19
me,	19
that	19
I	19
don’t	19
know	19
what	19
I’m	19
saying	19
or	19
doing.	19
But	19
I’d	19
like	19
to	19
know	19
of	19
this	19
lady,	19
my	19
lady	19
Dulcinea	19
del	19
Toboso,	19
where	19
she	19
learned	19
this	19
way	19
she	19
has	19
of	19
asking	19
favours.	19
She	19
comes	19
to	19
ask	19
me	19
to	19
score	19
my	19
flesh	19
with	19
lashes,	19
and	19
she	19
calls	19
me	19
soul	19
of	19
a	19
pitcher,	19
and	19
great	19
untamed	19
brute,	19
and	19
a	19
string	19
of	19
foul	19
names	19
that	19
the	19
devil	19
is	19
welcome	19
to.	19
Is	19
my	19
flesh	19
brass?	19
or	19
is	19
it	19
anything	19
to	19
me	19
whether	19
she	19
is	19
enchanted	19
or	19
not?	19
Does	19
she	19
bring	19
with	19
her	19
a	19
basket	19
of	19
fair	19
linen,	19
shirts,	19
kerchiefs,	19
socks—not	19
that	19
I	19
wear	19
any—to	19
coax	19
me?	19
No,	19
nothing	19
but	19
one	19
piece	19
of	19
abuse	19
after	19
another,	19
though	19
she	19
knows	19
the	19
proverb	19
they	19
have	19
here	19
that	19
‘an	19
ass	19
loaded	19
with	19
gold	19
goes	19
lightly	19
up	19
a	19
mountain,’	19
and	19
that	19
‘gifts	19
break	19
rocks,’	19
and	19
‘praying	19
to	19
God	19
and	19
plying	19
the	19
hammer,’	19
and	19
that	19
‘one	19
“take”	19
is	19
better	19
than	19
two	19
“I’ll	19
give	19
thee’s.”’	19
Then	19
there’s	19
my	19
master,	19
who	19
ought	19
to	19
stroke	19
me	19
down	19
and	19
pet	19
me	19
to	19
make	19
me	19
turn	19
wool	19
and	19
carded	19
cotton;	19
he	19
says	19
if	19
he	19
gets	19
hold	19
of	19
me	19
he’ll	19
tie	19
me	19
naked	19
to	19
a	19
tree	19
and	19
double	19
the	19
tale	19
of	19
lashes	19
on	19
me.	19
These	19
tender-hearted	19
gentry	19
should	19
consider	19
that	19
it’s	19
not	19
merely	19
a	19
squire,	19
but	19
a	19
governor	19
they	19
are	19
asking	19
to	19
whip	19
himself;	19
just	19
as	19
if	19
it	19
was	19
‘drink	19
with	19
cherries.’	19
Let	19
them	19
learn,	19
plague	19
take	19
them,	19
the	19
right	19
way	19
to	19
ask,	19
and	19
beg,	19
and	19
behave	19
themselves;	19
for	19
all	19
times	19
are	19
not	19
alike,	19
nor	19
are	19
people	19
always	19
in	19
good	19
humour.	19
I’m	19
now	19
ready	19
to	19
burst	19
with	19
grief	19
at	19
seeing	19
my	19
green	19
coat	19
torn,	19
and	19
they	19
come	19
to	19
ask	19
me	19
to	19
whip	19
myself	19
of	19
my	19
own	19
free	19
will,	19
I	19
having	19
as	19
little	19
fancy	19
for	19
it	19
as	19
for	19
turning	19
cacique.”	19
“Well	19
then,	19
the	19
fact	19
is,	19
friend	19
Sancho,”	19
said	19
the	19
duke,	19
“that	19
unless	19
you	19
become	19
softer	19
than	19
a	19
ripe	19
fig,	19
you	19
shall	19
not	19
get	19
hold	19
of	19
the	19
government.	19
It	19
would	19
be	19
a	19
nice	19
thing	19
for	19
me	19
to	19
send	19
my	19
islanders	19
a	19
cruel	19
governor	19
with	19
flinty	19
bowels,	19
who	19
won’t	19
yield	19
to	19
the	19
tears	19
of	19
afflicted	19
damsels	19
or	19
to	19
the	19
prayers	19
of	19
wise,	19
magisterial,	19
ancient	19
enchanters	19
and	19
sages.	19
In	19
short,	19
Sancho,	19
either	19
you	19
must	19
be	19
whipped	19
by	19
yourself,	19
or	19
they	19
must	19
whip	19
you,	19
or	19
you	19
shan’t	19
be	19
governor.”	19
“Señor,”	19
said	19
Sancho,	19
“won’t	19
two	19
days’	19
grace	19
be	19
given	19
me	19
in	19
which	19
to	19
consider	19
what	19
is	19
best	19
for	19
me?”	19
“No,	19
certainly	19
not,”	19
said	19
Merlin;	19
“here,	19
this	19
minute,	19
and	19
on	19
the	19
spot,	19
the	19
matter	19
must	19
be	19
settled;	19
either	19
Dulcinea	19
will	19
return	19
to	19
the	19
cave	19
of	19
Montesinos	19
and	19
to	19
her	19
former	19
condition	19
of	19
peasant	19
wench,	19
or	19
else	19
in	19
her	19
present	19
form	19
shall	19
be	19
carried	19
to	19
the	19
Elysian	19
fields,	19
where	19
she	19
will	19
remain	19
waiting	19
until	19
the	19
number	19
of	19
stripes	19
is	19
completed.”	19
“Now	19
then,	19
Sancho!”	19
said	19
the	19
duchess,	19
“show	19
courage,	19
and	19
gratitude	19
for	19
your	19
master	19
Don	19
Quixote’s	19
bread	19
that	19
you	19
have	19
eaten;	19
we	19
are	19
all	19
bound	19
to	19
oblige	19
and	19
please	19
him	19
for	19
his	19
benevolent	19
disposition	19
and	19
lofty	19
chivalry.	19
Consent	19
to	19
this	19
whipping,	19
my	19
son;	19
to	19
the	19
devil	19
with	19
the	19
devil,	19
and	19
leave	19
fear	19
to	19
milksops,	19
for	19
‘a	19
stout	19
heart	19
breaks	19
bad	19
luck,’	19
as	19
you	19
very	19
well	19
know.”	19
To	19
this	19
Sancho	19
replied	19
with	19
an	19
irrelevant	19
remark,	19
which,	19
addressing	19
Merlin,	19
he	19
made	19
to	19
him,	19
“Will	19
your	19
worship	19
tell	19
me,	19
Señor	19
Merlin—when	19
that	19
courier	19
devil	19
came	19
up	19
he	19
gave	19
my	19
master	19
a	19
message	19
from	19
Señor	19
Montesinos,	19
charging	19
him	19
to	19
wait	19
for	19
him	19
here,	19
as	19
he	19
was	19
coming	19
to	19
arrange	19
how	19
the	19
lady	19
Doña	19
Dulcinea	19
del	19
Toboso	19
was	19
to	19
be	19
disenchanted;	19
but	19
up	19
to	19
the	19
present	19
we	19
have	19
not	19
seen	19
Montesinos,	19
nor	19
anything	19
like	19
him.”	19
To	19
which	19
Merlin	19
made	19
answer,	19
“The	19
devil,	19
Sancho,	19
is	19
a	19
blockhead	19
and	19
a	19
great	19
scoundrel;	19
I	19
sent	19
him	19
to	19
look	19
for	19
your	19
master,	19
but	19
not	19
with	19
a	19
message	19
from	19
Montesinos	19
but	19
from	19
myself;	19
for	19
Montesinos	19
is	19
in	19
his	19
cave	19
expecting,	19
or	19
more	19
properly	19
speaking,	19
waiting	19
for	19
his	19
disenchantment;	19
for	19
there’s	19
the	19
tail	19
to	19
be	19
skinned	19
yet	19
for	19
him;	19
if	19
he	19
owes	19
you	19
anything,	19
or	19
you	19
have	19
any	19
business	19
to	19
transact	19
with	19
him,	19
I’ll	19
bring	19
him	19
to	19
you	19
and	19
put	19
him	19
where	19
you	19
choose;	19
but	19
for	19
the	19
present	19
make	19
up	19
your	19
mind	19
to	19
consent	19
to	19
this	19
penance,	19
and	19
believe	19
me	19
it	19
will	19
be	19
very	19
good	19
for	19
you,	19
for	19
soul	19
as	19
well	19
for	19
body—for	19
your	19
soul	19
because	19
of	19
the	19
charity	19
with	19
which	19
you	19
perform	19
it,	19
for	19
your	19
body	19
because	19
I	19
know	19
that	19
you	19
are	19
of	19
a	19
sanguine	19
habit	19
and	19
it	19
will	19
do	19
you	19
no	19
harm	19
to	19
draw	19
a	19
little	19
blood.”	19
“There	19
are	19
a	19
great	19
many	19
doctors	19
in	19
the	19
world;	19
even	19
the	19
enchanters	19
are	19
doctors,”	19
said	19
Sancho;	19
“however,	19
as	19
everybody	19
tells	19
me	19
the	19
same	19
thing—though	19
I	19
can’t	19
see	19
it	19
myself—I	19
say	19
I	19
am	19
willing	19
to	19
give	19
myself	19
the	19
three	19
thousand	19
three	19
hundred	19
lashes,	19
provided	19
I	19
am	19
to	19
lay	19
them	19
on	19
whenever	19
I	19
like,	19
without	19
any	19
fixing	19
of	19
days	19
or	19
times;	19
and	19
I’ll	19
try	19
and	19
get	19
out	19
of	19
debt	19
as	19
quickly	19
as	19
I	19
can,	19
that	19
the	19
world	19
may	19
enjoy	19
the	19
beauty	19
of	19
the	19
lady	19
Dulcinea	19
del	19
Toboso;	19
as	19
it	19
seems,	19
contrary	19
to	19
what	19
I	19
thought,	19
that	19
she	19
is	19
beautiful	19
after	19
all.	19
It	19
must	19
be	19
a	19
condition,	19
too,	19
that	19
I	19
am	19
not	19
to	19
be	19
bound	19
to	19
draw	19
blood	19
with	19
the	19
scourge,	19
and	19
that	19
if	19
any	19
of	19
the	19
lashes	19
happen	19
to	19
be	19
fly-flappers	19
they	19
are	19
to	19
count.	19
Item,	19
that,	19
in	19
case	19
I	19
should	19
make	19
any	19
mistake	19
in	19
the	19
reckoning,	19
Señor	19
Merlin,	19
as	19
he	19
knows	19
everything,	19
is	19
to	19
keep	19
count,	19
and	19
let	19
me	19
know	19
how	19
many	19
are	19
still	19
wanting	19
or	19
over	19
the	19
number.”	19
“There	19
will	19
be	19
no	19
need	19
to	19
let	19
you	19
know	19
of	19
any	19
over,”	19
said	19
Merlin,	19
“because,	19
when	19
you	19
reach	19
the	19
full	19
number,	19
the	19
lady	19
Dulcinea	19
will	19
at	19
once,	19
and	19
that	19
very	19
instant,	19
be	19
disenchanted,	19
and	19
will	19
come	19
in	19
her	19
gratitude	19
to	19
seek	19
out	19
the	19
worthy	19
Sancho,	19
and	19
thank	19
him,	19
and	19
even	19
reward	19
him	19
for	19
the	19
good	19
work.	19
So	19
you	19
have	19
no	19
cause	19
to	19
be	19
uneasy	19
about	19
stripes	19
too	19
many	19
or	19
too	19
few;	19
heaven	19
forbid	19
I	19
should	19
cheat	19
anyone	19
of	19
even	19
a	19
hair	19
of	19
his	19
head.”	19
“Well	19
then,	19
in	19
God’s	19
hands	19
be	19
it,”	19
said	19
Sancho;	19
“in	19
the	19
hard	19
case	19
I’m	19
in	19
I	19
give	19
in;	19
I	19
say	19
I	19
accept	19
the	19
penance	19
on	19
the	19
conditions	19
laid	19
down.”	19
The	19
instant	19
Sancho	19
uttered	19
these	19
last	19
words	19
the	19
music	19
of	19
the	19
clarions	19
struck	19
up	19
once	19
more,	19
and	19
again	19
a	19
host	19
of	19
muskets	19
were	19
discharged,	19
and	19
Don	19
Quixote	19
hung	19
on	19
Sancho’s	19
neck	19
kissing	19
him	19
again	19
and	19
again	19
on	19
the	19
forehead	19
and	19
cheeks.	19
The	19
duchess	19
and	19
the	19
duke	19
expressed	19
the	19
greatest	19
satisfaction,	19
the	19
car	19
began	19
to	19
move	19
on,	19
and	19
as	19
it	19
passed	19
the	19
fair	19
Dulcinea	19
bowed	19
to	19
the	19
duke	19
and	19
duchess	19
and	19
made	19
a	19
low	19
curtsey	19
to	19
Sancho.	19

The	19
duke	19
had	19
a	19
majordomo	19
of	19
a	19
very	19
facetious	19
and	19
sportive	19
turn,	19
and	19
he	19
it	19
was	19
that	19
played	19
the	19
part	19
of	19
Merlin,	19
made	19
all	19
the	19
arrangements	19
for	19
the	19
late	19
adventure,	19
composed	19
the	19
verses,	19
and	19
got	19
a	19
page	19
to	19
represent	19
Dulcinea;	19
and	19
now,	19
with	19
the	19
assistance	19
of	19
his	19
master	19
and	19
mistress,	19
he	19
got	19
up	19
another	19
of	19
the	19
drollest	19
and	19
strangest	19
contrivances	19
that	19
can	19
be	19
imagined.	19
The	19
duchess	19
asked	19
Sancho	19
the	19
next	19
day	19
if	19
he	19
had	19
made	19
a	19
beginning	19
with	19
his	19
penance	19
task	19
which	19
he	19
had	19
to	19
perform	19
for	19
the	19
disenchantment	19
of	19
Dulcinea.	19
He	19
said	19
he	19
had,	19
and	19
had	19
given	19
himself	19
five	19
lashes	19
overnight.	19
The	19
duchess	19
asked	19
him	19
what	19
he	19
had	19
given	19
them	19
with.	19
He	19
said	19
with	19
his	19
hand.	19
“That,”	19
said	19
the	19
duchess,	19
“is	19
more	19
like	19
giving	19
oneself	19
slaps	19
than	19
lashes;	19
I	19
am	19
sure	19
the	19
sage	19
Merlin	19
will	19
not	19
be	19
satisfied	19
with	19
such	19
tenderness;	19
worthy	19
Sancho	19
must	19
make	19
a	19
scourge	19
with	19
claws,	19
or	19
a	19
cat-o’-nine	19
tails,	19
that	19
will	19
make	19
itself	19
felt;	19
for	19
it’s	19
with	19
blood	19
that	19
letters	19
enter,	19
and	19
the	19
release	19
of	19
so	19
great	19
a	19
lady	19
as	19
Dulcinea	19
will	19
not	19
be	19
granted	19
so	19
cheaply,	19
or	19
at	19
such	19
a	19
paltry	19
price;	19
and	19
remember,	19
Sancho,	19
that	19
works	19
of	19
charity	19
done	19
in	19
a	19
lukewarm	19
and	19
half-hearted	19
way	19
are	19
without	19
merit	19
and	19
of	19
no	19
avail.”	19
To	19
which	19
Sancho	19
replied,	19
“If	19
your	19
ladyship	19
will	19
give	19
me	19
a	19
proper	19
scourge	19
or	19
cord,	19
I’ll	19
lay	19
on	19
with	19
it,	19
provided	19
it	19
does	19
not	19
hurt	19
too	19
much;	19
for	19
you	19
must	19
know,	19
boor	19
as	19
I	19
am,	19
my	19
flesh	19
is	19
more	19
cotton	19
than	19
hemp,	19
and	19
it	19
won’t	19
do	19
for	19
me	19
to	19
destroy	19
myself	19
for	19
the	19
good	19
of	19
anybody	19
else.”	19
“So	19
be	19
it	19
by	19
all	19
means,”	19
said	19
the	19
duchess;	19
“to-morrow	19
I’ll	19
give	19
you	19
a	19
scourge	19
that	19
will	19
be	19
just	19
the	19
thing	19
for	19
you,	19
and	19
will	19
accommodate	19
itself	19
to	19
the	19
tenderness	19
of	19
your	19
flesh,	19
as	19
if	19
it	19
was	19
its	19
own	19
sister.”	19
Then	19
said	19
Sancho,	19
“Your	19
highness	19
must	19
know,	19
dear	19
lady	19
of	19
my	19
soul,	19
that	19
I	19
have	19
a	19
letter	19
written	19
to	19
my	19
wife,	19
Teresa	19
Panza,	19
giving	19
her	19
an	19
account	19
of	19
all	19
that	19
has	19
happened	19
me	19
since	19
I	19
left	19
her;	19
I	19
have	19
it	19
here	19
in	19
my	19
bosom,	19
and	19
there’s	19
nothing	19
wanting	19
but	19
to	19
put	19
the	19
address	19
to	19
it;	19
I’d	19
be	19
glad	19
if	19
your	19
discretion	19
would	19
read	19
it,	19
for	19
I	19
think	19
it	19
runs	19
in	19
the	19
governor	19
style;	19
I	19
mean	19
the	19
way	19
governors	19
ought	19
to	19
write.”	19
“And	19
who	19
dictated	19
it?”	19
asked	19
the	19
duchess.	19
“Who	19
should	19
have	19
dictated	19
but	19
myself,	19
sinner	19
as	19
I	19
am?”	19
said	19
Sancho.	19
“And	19
did	19
you	19
write	19
it	19
yourself?”	19
said	19
the	19
duchess.	19
“That	19
I	19
didn’t,”	19
said	19
Sancho;	19
“for	19
I	19
can	19
neither	19
read	19
nor	19
write,	19
though	19
I	19
can	19
sign	19
my	19
name.”	19
“Let	19
us	19
see	19
it,”	19
said	19
the	19
duchess,	19
“for	19
never	19
fear	19
but	19
you	19
display	19
in	19
it	19
the	19
quality	19
and	19
quantity	19
of	19
your	19
wit.”	19
Sancho	19
drew	19
out	19
an	19
open	19
letter	19
from	19
his	19
bosom,	19
and	19
the	19
duchess,	19
taking	19
it,	19
found	19
it	19
ran	19
in	19
this	19
fashion:	19
SANCHO	19
PANZA’S	19
LETTER	19
TO	19
HIS	19
WIFE,	19
TERESA	19
PANZA	19
If	19
I	19
was	19
well	19
whipped	19
I	19
went	19
mounted	19
like	19
a	19
gentleman;	19
if	19
I	19
have	19
got	19
a	19
good	19
government	19
it	19
is	19
at	19
the	19
cost	19
of	19
a	19
good	19
whipping.	19
Thou	19
wilt	19
not	19
understand	19
this	19
just	19
now,	19
my	19
Teresa;	19
by-and-by	19
thou	19
wilt	19
know	19
what	19
it	19
means.	19
I	19
may	19
tell	19
thee,	19
Teresa,	19
I	19
mean	19
thee	19
to	19
go	19
in	19
a	19
coach,	19
for	19
that	19
is	19
a	19
matter	19
of	19
importance,	19
because	19
every	19
other	19
way	19
of	19
going	19
is	19
going	19
on	19
all-fours.	19
Thou	19
art	19
a	19
governor’s	19
wife;	19
take	19
care	19
that	19
nobody	19
speaks	19
evil	19
of	19
thee	19
behind	19
thy	19
back.	19
I	19
send	19
thee	19
here	19
a	19
green	19
hunting	19
suit	19
that	19
my	19
lady	19
the	19
duchess	19
gave	19
me;	19
alter	19
it	19
so	19
as	19
to	19
make	19
a	19
petticoat	19
and	19
bodice	19
for	19
our	19
daughter.	19
Don	19
Quixote,	19
my	19
master,	19
if	19
I	19
am	19
to	19
believe	19
what	19
I	19
hear	19
in	19
these	19
parts,	19
is	19
a	19
madman	19
of	19
some	19
sense,	19
and	19
a	19
droll	19
blockhead,	19
and	19
I	19
am	19
in	19
no	19
way	19
behind	19
him.	19
We	19
have	19
been	19
in	19
the	19
cave	19
of	19
Montesinos,	19
and	19
the	19
sage	19
Merlin	19
has	19
laid	19
hold	19
of	19
me	19
for	19
the	19
disenchantment	19
of	19
Dulcinea	19
del	19
Toboso,	19
her	19
that	19
is	19
called	19
Aldonza	19
Lorenzo	19
over	19
there.	19
With	19
three	19
thousand	19
three	19
hundred	19
lashes,	19
less	19
five,	19
that	19
I’m	19
to	19
give	19
myself,	19
she	19
will	19
be	19
left	19
as	19
entirely	19
disenchanted	19
as	19
the	19
mother	19
that	19
bore	19
her.	19
Say	19
nothing	19
of	19
this	19
to	19
anyone;	19
for,	19
make	19
thy	19
affairs	19
public,	19
and	19
some	19
will	19
say	19
they	19
are	19
white	19
and	19
others	19
will	19
say	19
they	19
are	19
black.	19
I	19
shall	19
leave	19
this	19
in	19
a	19
few	19
days	19
for	19
my	19
government,	19
to	19
which	19
I	19
am	19
going	19
with	19
a	19
mighty	19
great	19
desire	19
to	19
make	19
money,	19
for	19
they	19
tell	19
me	19
all	19
new	19
governors	19
set	19
out	19
with	19
the	19
same	19
desire;	19
I	19
will	19
feel	19
the	19
pulse	19
of	19
it	19
and	19
will	19
let	19
thee	19
know	19
if	19
thou	19
art	19
to	19
come	19
and	19
live	19
with	19
me	19
or	19
not.	19
Dapple	19
is	19
well	19
and	19
sends	19
many	19
remembrances	19
to	19
thee;	19
I	19
am	19
not	19
going	19
to	19
leave	19
him	19
behind	19
though	19
they	19
took	19
me	19
away	19
to	19
be	19
Grand	19
Turk.	19
My	19
lady	19
the	19
duchess	19
kisses	19
thy	19
hands	19
a	19
thousand	19
times;	19
do	19
thou	19
make	19
a	19
return	19
with	19
two	19
thousand,	19
for	19
as	19
my	19
master	19
says,	19
nothing	19
costs	19
less	19
or	19
is	19
cheaper	19
than	19
civility.	19
God	19
has	19
not	19
been	19
pleased	19
to	19
provide	19
another	19
valise	19
for	19
me	19
with	19
another	19
hundred	19
crowns,	19
like	19
the	19
one	19
the	19
other	19
day;	19
but	19
never	19
mind,	19
my	19
Teresa,	19
the	19
bell-ringer	19
is	19
in	19
safe	19
quarters,	19
and	19
all	19
will	19
come	19
out	19
in	19
the	19
scouring	19
of	19
the	19
government;	19
only	19
it	19
troubles	19
me	19
greatly	19
what	19
they	19
tell	19
me—that	19
once	19
I	19
have	19
tasted	19
it	19
I	19
will	19
eat	19
my	19
hands	19
off	19
after	19
it;	19
and	19
if	19
that	19
is	19
so	19
it	19
will	19
not	19
come	19
very	19
cheap	19
to	19
me;	19
though	19
to	19
be	19
sure	19
the	19
maimed	19
have	19
a	19
benefice	19
of	19
their	19
own	19
in	19
the	19
alms	19
they	19
beg	19
for;	19
so	19
that	19
one	19
way	19
or	19
another	19
thou	19
wilt	19
be	19
rich	19
and	19
in	19
luck.	19
God	19
give	19
it	19
to	19
thee	19
as	19
he	19
can,	19
and	19
keep	19
me	19
to	19
serve	19
thee.	19
From	19
this	19
castle,	19
the	19
20th	19
of	19
July,	19
1614.	19
Thy	19
husband,	19
the	19
governor,	19
SANCHO	19
PANZA	19
When	19
she	19
had	19
done	19
reading	19
the	19
letter	19
the	19
duchess	19
said	19
to	19
Sancho,	19
“On	19
two	19
points	19
the	19
worthy	19
governor	19
goes	19
rather	19
astray;	19
one	19
is	19
in	19
saying	19
or	19
hinting	19
that	19
this	19
government	19
has	19
been	19
bestowed	19
upon	19
him	19
for	19
the	19
lashes	19
that	19
he	19
is	19
to	19
give	19
himself,	19
when	19
he	19
knows	19
(and	19
he	19
cannot	19
deny	19
it)	19
that	19
when	19
my	19
lord	19
the	19
duke	19
promised	19
it	19
to	19
him	19
nobody	19
ever	19
dreamt	19
of	19
such	19
a	19
thing	19
as	19
lashes;	19
the	19
other	19
is	19
that	19
he	19
shows	19
himself	19
here	19
to	19
be	19
very	19
covetous;	19
and	19
I	19
would	19
not	19
have	19
him	19
a	19
money-seeker,	19
for	19
‘covetousness	19
bursts	19
the	19
bag,’	19
and	19
the	19
covetous	19
governor	19
does	19
ungoverned	19
justice.”	19
“I	19
don’t	19
mean	19
it	19
that	19
way,	19
señora,”	19
said	19
Sancho;	19
“and	19
if	19
you	19
think	19
the	19
letter	19
doesn’t	19
run	19
as	19
it	19
ought	19
to	19
do,	19
it’s	19
only	19
to	19
tear	19
it	19
up	19
and	19
make	19
another;	19
and	19
maybe	19
it	19
will	19
be	19
a	19
worse	19
one	19
if	19
it	19
is	19
left	19
to	19
my	19
gumption.”	19
“No,	19
no,”	19
said	19
the	19
duchess,	19
“this	19
one	19
will	19
do,	19
and	19
I	19
wish	19
the	19
duke	19
to	19
see	19
it.”	19
With	19
this	19
they	19
betook	19
themselves	19
to	19
a	19
garden	19
where	19
they	19
were	19
to	19
dine,	19
and	19
the	19
duchess	19
showed	19
Sancho’s	19
letter	19
to	19
the	19
duke,	19
who	19
was	19
highly	19
delighted	19
with	19
it.	19
They	19
dined,	19
and	19
after	19
the	19
cloth	19
had	19
been	19
removed	19
and	19
they	19
had	19
amused	19
themselves	19
for	19
a	19
while	19
with	19
Sancho’s	19
rich	19
conversation,	19
the	19
melancholy	19
sound	19
of	19
a	19
fife	19
and	19
harsh	19
discordant	19
drum	19
made	19
itself	19
heard.	19
All	19
seemed	19
somewhat	19
put	19
out	19
by	19
this	19
dull,	19
confused,	19
martial	19
harmony,	19
especially	19
Don	19
Quixote,	19
who	19
could	19
not	19
keep	19
his	19
seat	19
from	19
pure	19
disquietude;	19
as	19
to	19
Sancho,	19
it	19
is	19
needless	19
to	19
say	19
that	19
fear	19
drove	19
him	19
to	19
his	19
usual	19
refuge,	19
the	19
side	19
or	19
the	19
skirts	19
of	19
the	19
duchess;	19
and	19
indeed	19
and	19
in	19
truth	19
the	19
sound	19
they	19
heard	19
was	19
a	19
most	19
doleful	19
and	19
melancholy	19
one.	19
While	19
they	19
were	19
still	19
in	19
uncertainty	19
they	19
saw	19
advancing	19
towards	19
them	19
through	19
the	19
garden	19
two	19
men	19
clad	19
in	19
mourning	19
robes	19
so	19
long	19
and	19
flowing	19
that	19
they	19
trailed	19
upon	19
the	19
ground.	19
As	19
they	19
marched	19
they	19
beat	19
two	19
great	19
drums	19
which	19
were	19
likewise	19
draped	19
in	19
black,	19
and	19
beside	19
them	19
came	19
the	19
fife	19
player,	19
black	19
and	19
sombre	19
like	19
the	19
others.	19
Following	19
these	19
came	19
a	19
personage	19
of	19
gigantic	19
stature	19
enveloped	19
rather	19
than	19
clad	19
in	19
a	19
gown	19
of	19
the	19
deepest	19
black,	19
the	19
skirt	19
of	19
which	19
was	19
of	19
prodigious	19
dimensions.	19
Over	19
the	19
gown,	19
girdling	19
or	19
crossing	19
his	19
figure,	19
he	19
had	19
a	19
broad	19
baldric	19
which	19
was	19
also	19
black,	19
and	19
from	19
which	19
hung	19
a	19
huge	19
scimitar	19
with	19
a	19
black	19
scabbard	19
and	19
furniture.	19
He	19
had	19
his	19
face	19
covered	19
with	19
a	19
transparent	19
black	19
veil,	19
through	19
which	19
might	19
be	19
descried	19
a	19
very	19
long	19
beard	19
as	19
white	19
as	19
snow.	19
He	19
came	19
on	19
keeping	19
step	19
to	19
the	19
sound	19
of	19
the	19
drums	19
with	19
great	19
gravity	19
and	19
dignity;	19
and,	19
in	19
short,	19
his	19
stature,	19
his	19
gait,	19
the	19
sombreness	19
of	19
his	19
appearance	19
and	19
his	19
following	19
might	19
well	19
have	19
struck	19
with	19
astonishment,	19
as	19
they	19
did,	19
all	19
who	19
beheld	19
him	19
without	19
knowing	19
who	19
he	19
was.	19
With	19
this	19
measured	19
pace	19
and	19
in	19
this	19
guise	19
he	19
advanced	19
to	19
kneel	19
before	19
the	19
duke,	19
who,	19
with	19
the	19
others,	19
awaited	19
him	19
standing.	19
The	19
duke,	19
however,	19
would	19
not	19
on	19
any	19
account	19
allow	19
him	19
to	19
speak	19
until	19
he	19
had	19
risen.	19
The	19
prodigious	19
scarecrow	19
obeyed,	19
and	19
standing	19
up,	19
removed	19
the	19
veil	19
from	19
his	19
face	19
and	19
disclosed	19
the	19
most	19
enormous,	19
the	19
longest,	19
the	19
whitest	19
and	19
the	19
thickest	19
beard	19
that	19
human	19
eyes	19
had	19
ever	19
beheld	19
until	19
that	19
moment,	19
and	19
then	19
fetching	19
up	19
a	19
grave,	19
sonorous	19
voice	19
from	19
the	19
depths	19
of	19
his	19
broad,	19
capacious	19
chest,	19
and	19
fixing	19
his	19
eyes	19
on	19
the	19
duke,	19
he	19
said:	19
“Most	19
high	19
and	19
mighty	19
señor,	19
my	19
name	19
is	19
Trifaldin	19
of	19
the	19
White	19
Beard;	19
I	19
am	19
squire	19
to	19
the	19
Countess	19
Trifaldi,	19
otherwise	19
called	19
the	19
Distressed	19
Duenna,	19
on	19
whose	19
behalf	19
I	19
bear	19
a	19
message	19
to	19
your	19
highness,	19
which	19
is	19
that	19
your	19
magnificence	19
will	19
be	19
pleased	19
to	19
grant	19
her	19
leave	19
and	19
permission	19
to	19
come	19
and	19
tell	19
you	19
her	19
trouble,	19
which	19
is	19
one	19
of	19
the	19
strangest	19
and	19
most	19
wonderful	19
that	19
the	19
mind	19
most	19
familiar	19
with	19
trouble	19
in	19
the	19
world	19
could	19
have	19
imagined;	19
but	19
first	19
she	19
desires	19
to	19
know	19
if	19
the	19
valiant	19
and	19
never	19
vanquished	19
knight,	19
Don	19
Quixote	19
of	19
La	19
Mancha,	19
is	19
in	19
this	19
your	19
castle,	19
for	19
she	19
has	19
come	19
in	19
quest	19
of	19
him	19
on	19
foot	19
and	19
without	19
breaking	19
her	19
fast	19
from	19
the	19
kingdom	19
of	19
Kandy	19
to	19
your	19
realms	19
here;	19
a	19
thing	19
which	19
may	19
and	19
ought	19
to	19
be	19
regarded	19
as	19
a	19
miracle	19
or	19
set	19
down	19
to	19
enchantment;	19
she	19
is	19
even	19
now	19
at	19
the	19
gate	19
of	19
this	19
fortress	19
or	19
plaisance,	19
and	19
only	19
waits	19
for	19
your	19
permission	19
to	19
enter.	19
I	19
have	19
spoken.”	19
And	19
with	19
that	19
he	19
coughed,	19
and	19
stroked	19
down	19
his	19
beard	19
with	19
both	19
his	19
hands,	19
and	19
stood	19
very	19
tranquilly	19
waiting	19
for	19
the	19
response	19
of	19
the	19
duke,	19
which	19
was	19
to	19
this	19
effect:	19
“Many	19
days	19
ago,	19
worthy	19
squire	19
Trifaldin	19
of	19
the	19
White	19
Beard,	19
we	19
heard	19
of	19
the	19
misfortune	19
of	19
my	19
lady	19
the	19
Countess	19
Trifaldi,	19
whom	19
the	19
enchanters	19
have	19
caused	19
to	19
be	19
called	19
the	19
Distressed	19
Duenna.	19
Bid	19
her	19
enter,	19
O	19
stupendous	19
squire,	19
and	19
tell	19
her	19
that	19
the	19
valiant	19
knight	19
Don	19
Quixote	19
of	19
La	19
Mancha	19
is	19
here,	19
and	19
from	19
his	19
generous	19
disposition	19
she	19
may	19
safely	19
promise	19
herself	19
every	19
protection	19
and	19
assistance;	19
and	19
you	19
may	19
tell	19
her,	19
too,	19
that	19
if	19
my	19
aid	19
be	19
necessary	19
it	19
will	19
not	19
be	19
withheld,	19
for	19
I	19
am	19
bound	19
to	19
give	19
it	19
to	19
her	19
by	19
my	19
quality	19
of	19
knight,	19
which	19
involves	19
the	19
protection	19
of	19
women	19
of	19
all	19
sorts,	19
especially	19
widowed,	19
wronged,	19
and	19
distressed	19
dames,	19
such	19
as	19
her	19
ladyship	19
seems	19
to	19
be.”	19
On	19
hearing	19
this	19
Trifaldin	19
bent	19
the	19
knee	19
to	19
the	19
ground,	19
and	19
making	19
a	19
sign	19
to	19
the	19
fifer	19
and	19
drummers	19
to	19
strike	19
up,	19
he	19
turned	19
and	19
marched	19
out	19
of	19
the	19
garden	19
to	19
the	19
same	19
notes	19
and	19
at	19
the	19
same	19
pace	19
as	19
when	19
he	19
entered,	19
leaving	19
them	19
all	19
amazed	19
at	19
his	19
bearing	19
and	19
solemnity.	19
Turning	19
to	19
Don	19
Quixote,	19
the	19
duke	19
said,	19
“After	19
all,	19
renowned	19
knight,	19
the	19
mists	19
of	19
malice	19
and	19
ignorance	19
are	19
unable	19
to	19
hide	19
or	19
obscure	19
the	19
light	19
of	19
valour	19
and	19
virtue.	19
I	19
say	19
so,	19
because	19
your	19
excellence	19
has	19
been	19
barely	19
six	19
days	19
in	19
this	19
castle,	19
and	19
already	19
the	19
unhappy	19
and	19
the	19
afflicted	19
come	19
in	19
quest	19
of	19
you	19
from	19
lands	19
far	19
distant	19
and	19
remote,	19
and	19
not	19
in	19
coaches	19
or	19
on	19
dromedaries,	19
but	19
on	19
foot	19
and	19
fasting,	19
confident	19
that	19
in	19
that	19
mighty	19
arm	19
they	19
will	19
find	19
a	19
cure	19
for	19
their	19
sorrows	19
and	19
troubles;	19
thanks	19
to	19
your	19
great	19
achievements,	19
which	19
are	19
circulated	19
all	19
over	19
the	19
known	19
earth.”	19
“I	19
wish,	19
señor	19
duke,”	19
replied	19
Don	19
Quixote,	19
“that	19
blessed	19
ecclesiastic,	19
who	19
at	19
table	19
the	19
other	19
day	19
showed	19
such	19
ill-will	19
and	19
bitter	19
spite	19
against	19
knights-errant,	19
were	19
here	19
now	19
to	19
see	19
with	19
his	19
own	19
eyes	19
whether	19
knights	19
of	19
the	19
sort	19
are	19
needed	19
in	19
the	19
world;	19
he	19
would	19
at	19
any	19
rate	19
learn	19
by	19
experience	19
that	19
those	19
suffering	19
any	19
extraordinary	19
affliction	19
or	19
sorrow,	19
in	19
extreme	19
cases	19
and	19
unusual	19
misfortunes	19
do	19
not	19
go	19
to	19
look	19
for	19
a	19
remedy	19
to	19
the	19
houses	19
of	19
jurists	19
or	19
village	19
sacristans,	19
or	19
to	19
the	19
knight	19
who	19
has	19
never	19
attempted	19
to	19
pass	19
the	19
bounds	19
of	19
his	19
own	19
town,	19
or	19
to	19
the	19
indolent	19
courtier	19
who	19
only	19
seeks	19
for	19
news	19
to	19
repeat	19
and	19
talk	19
of,	19
instead	19
of	19
striving	19
to	19
do	19
deeds	19
and	19
exploits	19
for	19
others	19
to	19
relate	19
and	19
record.	19
Relief	19
in	19
distress,	19
help	19
in	19
need,	19
protection	19
for	19
damsels,	19
consolation	19
for	19
widows,	19
are	19
to	19
be	19
found	19
in	19
no	19
sort	19
of	19
persons	19
better	19
than	19
in	19
knights-errant;	19
and	19
I	19
give	19
unceasing	19
thanks	19
to	19
heaven	19
that	19
I	19
am	19
one,	19
and	19
regard	19
any	19
misfortune	19
or	19
suffering	19
that	19
may	19
befall	19
me	19
in	19
the	19
pursuit	19
of	19
so	19
honourable	19
a	19
calling	19
as	19
endured	19
to	19
good	19
purpose.	19
Let	19
this	19
duenna	19
come	19
and	19
ask	19
what	19
she	19
will,	19
for	19
I	19
will	19
effect	19
her	19
relief	19
by	19
the	19
might	19
of	19
my	19
arm	19
and	19
the	19
dauntless	19
resolution	19
of	19
my	19
bold	19
heart.”	19

CONTINUED	19
THE	19
NOTABLE	19
ADVENTURE	19
OF	19
THE	19
DISTRESSED	19
DUENNA	19
p37a.jpg	19
(94K)	19
Full	19
Size	19
The	19
duke	19
and	19
duchess	19
were	19
extremely	19
glad	19
to	19
see	19
how	19
readily	19
Don	19
Quixote	19
fell	19
in	19
with	19
their	19
scheme;	19
but	19
at	19
this	19
moment	19
Sancho	19
observed,	19
“I	19
hope	19
this	19
señora	19
duenna	19
won’t	19
be	19
putting	19
any	19
difficulties	19
in	19
the	19
way	19
of	19
the	19
promise	19
of	19
my	19
government;	19
for	19
I	19
have	19
heard	19
a	19
Toledo	19
apothecary,	19
who	19
talked	19
like	19
a	19
goldfinch,	19
say	19
that	19
where	19
duennas	19
were	19
mixed	19
up	19
nothing	19
good	19
could	19
happen.	19
God	19
bless	19
me,	19
how	19
he	19
hated	19
them,	19
that	19
same	19
apothecary!	19
And	19
so	19
what	19
I’m	19
thinking	19
is,	19
if	19
all	19
duennas,	19
of	19
whatever	19
sort	19
or	19
condition	19
they	19
may	19
be,	19
are	19
plagues	19
and	19
busybodies,	19
what	19
must	19
they	19
be	19
that	19
are	19
distressed,	19
like	19
this	19
Countess	19
Three-skirts	19
or	19
Three-tails!—for	19
in	19
my	19
country	19
skirts	19
or	19
tails,	19
tails	19
or	19
skirts,	19
it’s	19
all	19
one.”	19
“Hush,	19
friend	19
Sancho,”	19
said	19
Don	19
Quixote;	19
“since	19
this	19
lady	19
duenna	19
comes	19
in	19
quest	19
of	19
me	19
from	19
such	19
a	19
distant	19
land	19
she	19
cannot	19
be	19
one	19
of	19
those	19
the	19
apothecary	19
meant;	19
moreover	19
this	19
is	19
a	19
countess,	19
and	19
when	19
countesses	19
serve	19
as	19
duennas	19
it	19
is	19
in	19
the	19
service	19
of	19
queens	19
and	19
empresses,	19
for	19
in	19
their	19
own	19
houses	19
they	19
are	19
mistresses	19
paramount	19
and	19
have	19
other	19
duennas	19
to	19
wait	19
on	19
them.”	19
To	19
this	19
Doña	19
Rodriguez,	19
who	19
was	19
present,	19
made	19
answer,	19
“My	19
lady	19
the	19
duchess	19
has	19
duennas	19
in	19
her	19
service	19
that	19
might	19
be	19
countesses	19
if	19
it	19
was	19
the	19
will	19
of	19
fortune;	19
‘but	19
laws	19
go	19
as	19
kings	19
like;’	19
let	19
nobody	19
speak	19
ill	19
of	19
duennas,	19
above	19
all	19
of	19
ancient	19
maiden	19
ones;	19
for	19
though	19
I	19
am	19
not	19
one	19
myself,	19
I	19
know	19
and	19
am	19
aware	19
of	19
the	19
advantage	19
a	19
maiden	19
duenna	19
has	19
over	19
one	19
that	19
is	19
a	19
widow;	19
but	19
‘he	19
who	19
clipped	19
us	19
has	19
kept	19
the	19
scissors.’”	19
“For	19
all	19
that,”	19
said	19
Sancho,	19
“there’s	19
so	19
much	19
to	19
be	19
clipped	19
about	19
duennas,	19
so	19
my	19
barber	19
said,	19
that	19
‘it	19
will	19
be	19
better	19
not	19
to	19
stir	19
the	19
rice	19
even	19
though	19
it	19
sticks.’”	19
“These	19
squires,”	19
returned	19
Doña	19
Rodriguez,	19
“are	19
always	19
our	19
enemies;	19
and	19
as	19
they	19
are	19
the	19
haunting	19
spirits	19
of	19
the	19
antechambers	19
and	19
watch	19
us	19
at	19
every	19
step,	19
whenever	19
they	19
are	19
not	19
saying	19
their	19
prayers	19
(and	19
that’s	19
often	19
enough)	19
they	19
spend	19
their	19
time	19
in	19
tattling	19
about	19
us,	19
digging	19
up	19
our	19
bones	19
and	19
burying	19
our	19
good	19
name.	19
But	19
I	19
can	19
tell	19
these	19
walking	19
blocks	19
that	19
we	19
will	19
live	19
in	19
spite	19
of	19
them,	19
and	19
in	19
great	19
houses	19
too,	19
though	19
we	19
die	19
of	19
hunger	19
and	19
cover	19
our	19
flesh,	19
be	19
it	19
delicate	19
or	19
not,	19
with	19
widow’s	19
weeds,	19
as	19
one	19
covers	19
or	19
hides	19
a	19
dunghill	19
on	19
a	19
procession	19
day.	19
By	19
my	19
faith,	19
if	19
it	19
were	19
permitted	19
me	19
and	19
time	19
allowed,	19
I	19
could	19
prove,	19
not	19
only	19
to	19
those	19
here	19
present,	19
but	19
to	19
all	19
the	19
world,	19
that	19
there	19
is	19
no	19
virtue	19
that	19
is	19
not	19
to	19
be	19
found	19
in	19
a	19
duenna.”	19
“I	19
have	19
no	19
doubt,”	19
said	19
the	19
duchess,	19
“that	19
my	19
good	19
Doña	19
Rodriguez	19
is	19
right,	19
and	19
very	19
much	19
so;	19
but	19
she	19
had	19
better	19
bide	19
her	19
time	19
for	19
fighting	19
her	19
own	19
battle	19
and	19
that	19
of	19
the	19
rest	19
of	19
the	19
duennas,	19
so	19
as	19
to	19
crush	19
the	19
calumny	19
of	19
that	19
vile	19
apothecary,	19
and	19
root	19
out	19
the	19
prejudice	19
in	19
the	19
great	19
Sancho	19
Panza’s	19
mind.”	19
To	19
which	19
Sancho	19
replied,	19
“Ever	19
since	19
I	19
have	19
sniffed	19
the	19
governorship	19
I	19
have	19
got	19
rid	19
of	19
the	19
humours	19
of	19
a	19
squire,	19
and	19
I	19
don’t	19
care	19
a	19
wild	19
fig	19
for	19
all	19
the	19
duennas	19
in	19
the	19
world.”	19
They	19
would	19
have	19
carried	19
on	19
this	19
duenna	19
dispute	19
further	19
had	19
they	19
not	19
heard	19
the	19
notes	19
of	19
the	19
fife	19
and	19
drums	19
once	19
more,	19
from	19
which	19
they	19
concluded	19
that	19
the	19
Distressed	19
Duenna	19
was	19
making	19
her	19
entrance.	19
The	19
duchess	19
asked	19
the	19
duke	19
if	19
it	19
would	19
be	19
proper	19
to	19
go	19
out	19
to	19
receive	19
her,	19
as	19
she	19
was	19
a	19
countess	19
and	19
a	19
person	19
of	19
rank.	19
“In	19
respect	19
of	19
her	19
being	19
a	19
countess,”	19
said	19
Sancho,	19
before	19
the	19
duke	19
could	19
reply,	19
“I	19
am	19
for	19
your	19
highnesses	19
going	19
out	19
to	19
receive	19
her;	19
but	19
in	19
respect	19
of	19
her	19
being	19
a	19
duenna,	19
it	19
is	19
my	19
opinion	19
you	19
should	19
not	19
stir	19
a	19
step.”	19
“Who	19
bade	19
thee	19
meddle	19
in	19
this,	19
Sancho?”	19
said	19
Don	19
Quixote.	19
“Who,	19
señor?”	19
said	19
Sancho;	19
“I	19
meddle	19
for	19
I	19
have	19
a	19
right	19
to	19
meddle,	19
as	19
a	19
squire	19
who	19
has	19
learned	19
the	19
rules	19
of	19
courtesy	19
in	19
the	19
school	19
of	19
your	19
worship,	19
the	19
most	19
courteous	19
and	19
best-bred	19
knight	19
in	19
the	19
whole	19
world	19
of	19
courtliness;	19
and	19
in	19
these	19
things,	19
as	19
I	19
have	19
heard	19
your	19
worship	19
say,	19
as	19
much	19
is	19
lost	19
by	19
a	19
card	19
too	19
many	19
as	19
by	19
a	19
card	19
too	19
few,	19
and	19
to	19
one	19
who	19
has	19
his	19
ears	19
open,	19
few	19
words.”	19
“Sancho	19
is	19
right,”	19
said	19
the	19
duke;	19
“we’ll	19
see	19
what	19
the	19
countess	19
is	19
like,	19
and	19
by	19
that	19
measure	19
the	19
courtesy	19
that	19
is	19
due	19
to	19
her.”	19
And	19
now	19
the	19
drums	19
and	19
fife	19
made	19
their	19
entrance	19
as	19
before;	19
and	19
here	19
the	19
author	19
brought	19
this	19
short	19
chapter	19
to	19
an	19
end	19
and	19
began	19
the	19
next,	19
following	19
up	19
the	19
same	19
adventure,	19
which	19
is	19
one	19
of	19
the	19
most	19
notable	19
in	19
the	19
history.	19

(54K)	19
Full	19
Size	19
Following	19
the	19
melancholy	19
musicians	19
there	19
filed	19
into	19
the	19
garden	19
as	19
many	19
as	19
twelve	19
duennas,	19
in	19
two	19
lines,	19
all	19
dressed	19
in	19
ample	19
mourning	19
robes	19
apparently	19
of	19
milled	19
serge,	19
with	19
hoods	19
of	19
fine	19
white	19
gauze	19
so	19
long	19
that	19
they	19
allowed	19
only	19
the	19
border	19
of	19
the	19
robe	19
to	19
be	19
seen.	19
Behind	19
them	19
came	19
the	19
Countess	19
Trifaldi,	19
the	19
squire	19
Trifaldin	19
of	19
the	19
White	19
Beard	19
leading	19
her	19
by	19
the	19
hand,	19
clad	19
in	19
the	19
finest	19
unnapped	19
black	19
baize,	19
such	19
that,	19
had	19
it	19
a	19
nap,	19
every	19
tuft	19
would	19
have	19
shown	19
as	19
big	19
as	19
a	19
Martos	19
chickpea;	19
the	19
tail,	19
or	19
skirt,	19
or	19
whatever	19
it	19
might	19
be	19
called,	19
ended	19
in	19
three	19
points	19
which	19
were	19
borne	19
up	19
by	19
the	19
hands	19
of	19
three	19
pages,	19
likewise	19
dressed	19
in	19
mourning,	19
forming	19
an	19
elegant	19
geometrical	19
figure	19
with	19
the	19
three	19
acute	19
angles	19
made	19
by	19
the	19
three	19
points,	19
from	19
which	19
all	19
who	19
saw	19
the	19
peaked	19
skirt	19
concluded	19
that	19
it	19
must	19
be	19
because	19
of	19
it	19
the	19
countess	19
was	19
called	19
Trifaldi,	19
as	19
though	19
it	19
were	19
Countess	19
of	19
the	19
Three	19
Skirts;	19
and	19
Benengeli	19
says	19
it	19
was	19
so,	19
and	19
that	19
by	19
her	19
right	19
name	19
she	19
was	19
called	19
the	19
Countess	19
Lobuna,	19
because	19
wolves	19
bred	19
in	19
great	19
numbers	19
in	19
her	19
country;	19
and	19
if,	19
instead	19
of	19
wolves,	19
they	19
had	19
been	19
foxes,	19
she	19
would	19
have	19
been	19
called	19
the	19
Countess	19
Zorruna,	19
as	19
it	19
was	19
the	19
custom	19
in	19
those	19
parts	19
for	19
lords	19
to	19
take	19
distinctive	19
titles	19
from	19
the	19
thing	19
or	19
things	19
most	19
abundant	19
in	19
their	19
dominions;	19
this	19
countess,	19
however,	19
in	19
honour	19
of	19
the	19
new	19
fashion	19
of	19
her	19
skirt,	19
dropped	19
Lobuna	19
and	19
took	19
up	19
Trifaldi.	19
The	19
twelve	19
duennas	19
and	19
the	19
lady	19
came	19
on	19
at	19
procession	19
pace,	19
their	19
faces	19
being	19
covered	19
with	19
black	19
veils,	19
not	19
transparent	19
ones	19
like	19
Trifaldin’s,	19
but	19
so	19
close	19
that	19
they	19
allowed	19
nothing	19
to	19
be	19
seen	19
through	19
them.	19
As	19
soon	19
as	19
the	19
band	19
of	19
duennas	19
was	19
fully	19
in	19
sight,	19
the	19
duke,	19
the	19
duchess,	19
and	19
Don	19
Quixote	19
stood	19
up,	19
as	19
well	19
as	19
all	19
who	19
were	19
watching	19
the	19
slow-moving	19
procession.	19
The	19
twelve	19
duennas	19
halted	19
and	19
formed	19
a	19
lane,	19
along	19
which	19
the	19
Distressed	19
One	19
advanced,	19
Trifaldin	19
still	19
holding	19
her	19
hand.	19
On	19
seeing	19
this	19
the	19
duke,	19
the	19
duchess,	19
and	19
Don	19
Quixote	19
went	19
some	19
twelve	19
paces	19
forward	19
to	19
meet	19
her.	19
She	19
then,	19
kneeling	19
on	19
the	19
ground,	19
said	19
in	19
a	19
voice	19
hoarse	19
and	19
rough,	19
rather	19
than	19
fine	19
and	19
delicate,	19
“May	19
it	19
please	19
your	19
highnesses	19
not	19
to	19
offer	19
such	19
courtesies	19
to	19
this	19
your	19
servant,	19
I	19
should	19
say	19
to	19
this	19
your	19
handmaid,	19
for	19
I	19
am	19
in	19
such	19
distress	19
that	19
I	19
shall	19
never	19
be	19
able	19
to	19
make	19
a	19
proper	19
return,	19
because	19
my	19
strange	19
and	19
unparalleled	19
misfortune	19
has	19
carried	19
off	19
my	19
wits,	19
and	19
I	19
know	19
not	19
whither;	19
but	19
it	19
must	19
be	19
a	19
long	19
way	19
off,	19
for	19
the	19
more	19
I	19
look	19
for	19
them	19
the	19
less	19
I	19
find	19
them.”	19
“He	19
would	19
be	19
wanting	19
in	19
wits,	19
señora	19
countess,”	19
said	19
the	19
duke,	19
“who	19
did	19
not	19
perceive	19
your	19
worth	19
by	19
your	19
person,	19
for	19
at	19
a	19
glance	19
it	19
may	19
be	19
seen	19
it	19
deserves	19
all	19
the	19
cream	19
of	19
courtesy	19
and	19
flower	19
of	19
polite	19
usage;”	19
and	19
raising	19
her	19
up	19
by	19
the	19
hand	19
he	19
led	19
her	19
to	19
a	19
seat	19
beside	19
the	19
duchess,	19
who	19
likewise	19
received	19
her	19
with	19
great	19
urbanity.	19
Don	19
Quixote	19
remained	19
silent,	19
while	19
Sancho	19
was	19
dying	19
to	19
see	19
the	19
features	19
of	19
Trifaldi	19
and	19
one	19
or	19
two	19
of	19
her	19
many	19
duennas;	19
but	19
there	19
was	19
no	19
possibility	19
of	19
it	19
until	19
they	19
themselves	19
displayed	19
them	19
of	19
their	19
own	19
accord	19
and	19
free	19
will.	19
All	19
kept	19
still,	19
waiting	19
to	19
see	19
who	19
would	19
break	19
silence,	19
which	19
the	19
Distressed	19
Duenna	19
did	19
in	19
these	19
words:	19
“I	19
am	19
confident,	19
most	19
mighty	19
lord,	19
most	19
fair	19
lady,	19
and	19
most	19
discreet	19
company,	19
that	19
my	19
most	19
miserable	19
misery	19
will	19
be	19
accorded	19
a	19
reception	19
no	19
less	19
dispassionate	19
than	19
generous	19
and	19
condolent	19
in	19
your	19
most	19
valiant	19
bosoms,	19
for	19
it	19
is	19
one	19
that	19
is	19
enough	19
to	19
melt	19
marble,	19
soften	19
diamonds,	19
and	19
mollify	19
the	19
steel	19
of	19
the	19
most	19
hardened	19
hearts	19
in	19
the	19
world;	19
but	19
ere	19
it	19
is	19
proclaimed	19
to	19
your	19
hearing,	19
not	19
to	19
say	19
your	19
ears,	19
I	19
would	19
fain	19
be	19
enlightened	19
whether	19
there	19
be	19
present	19
in	19
this	19
society,	19
circle,	19
or	19
company,	19
that	19
knight	19
immaculatissimus,	19
Don	19
Quixote	19
de	19
la	19
Manchissima,	19
and	19
his	19
squirissimus	19
Panza.”	19
“The	19
Panza	19
is	19
here,”	19
said	19
Sancho,	19
before	19
anyone	19
could	19
reply,	19
“and	19
Don	19
Quixotissimus	19
too;	19
and	19
so,	19
most	19
distressedest	19
Duenissima,	19
you	19
may	19
say	19
what	19
you	19
willissimus,	19
for	19
we	19
are	19
all	19
readissimus	19
to	19
do	19
you	19
any	19
servissimus.”	19
On	19
this	19
Don	19
Quixote	19
rose,	19
and	19
addressing	19
the	19
Distressed	19
Duenna,	19
said,	19
“If	19
your	19
sorrows,	19
afflicted	19
lady,	19
can	19
indulge	19
in	19
any	19
hope	19
of	19
relief	19
from	19
the	19
valour	19
or	19
might	19
of	19
any	19
knight-errant,	19
here	19
are	19
mine,	19
which,	19
feeble	19
and	19
limited	19
though	19
they	19
be,	19
shall	19
be	19
entirely	19
devoted	19
to	19
your	19
service.	19
I	19
am	19
Don	19
Quixote	19
of	19
La	19
Mancha,	19
whose	19
calling	19
it	19
is	19
to	19
give	19
aid	19
to	19
the	19
needy	19
of	19
all	19
sorts;	19
and	19
that	19
being	19
so,	19
it	19
is	19
not	19
necessary	19
for	19
you,	19
señora,	19
to	19
make	19
any	19
appeal	19
to	19
benevolence,	19
or	19
deal	19
in	19
preambles,	19
only	19
to	19
tell	19
your	19
woes	19
plainly	19
and	19
straightforwardly:	19
for	19
you	19
have	19
hearers	19
that	19
will	19
know	19
how,	19
if	19
not	19
to	19
remedy	19
them,	19
to	19
sympathise	19
with	19
them.”	19
On	19
hearing	19
this,	19
the	19
Distressed	19
Duenna	19
made	19
as	19
though	19
she	19
would	19
throw	19
herself	19
at	19
Don	19
Quixote’s	19
feet,	19
and	19
actually	19
did	19
fall	19
before	19
them	19
and	19
said,	19
as	19
she	19
strove	19
to	19
embrace	19
them,	19
“Before	19
these	19
feet	19
and	19
legs	19
I	19
cast	19
myself,	19
O	19
unconquered	19
knight,	19
as	19
before,	19
what	19
they	19
are,	19
the	19
foundations	19
and	19
pillars	19
of	19
knight-errantry;	19
these	19
feet	19
I	19
desire	19
to	19
kiss,	19
for	19
upon	19
their	19
steps	19
hangs	19
and	19
depends	19
the	19
sole	19
remedy	19
for	19
my	19
misfortune,	19
O	19
valorous	19
errant,	19
whose	19
veritable	19
achievements	19
leave	19
behind	19
and	19
eclipse	19
the	19
fabulous	19
ones	19
of	19
the	19
Amadises,	19
Esplandians,	19
and	19
Belianises!”	19
Then	19
turning	19
from	19
Don	19
Quixote	19
to	19
Sancho	19
Panza,	19
and	19
grasping	19
his	19
hands,	19
she	19
said,	19
“O	19
thou,	19
most	19
loyal	19
squire	19
that	19
ever	19
served	19
knight-errant	19
in	19
this	19
present	19
age	19
or	19
ages	19
past,	19
whose	19
goodness	19
is	19
more	19
extensive	19
than	19
the	19
beard	19
of	19
Trifaldin	19
my	19
companion	19
here	19
of	19
present,	19
well	19
mayest	19
thou	19
boast	19
thyself	19
that,	19
in	19
serving	19
the	19
great	19
Don	19
Quixote,	19
thou	19
art	19
serving,	19
summed	19
up	19
in	19
one,	19
the	19
whole	19
host	19
of	19
knights	19
that	19
have	19
ever	19
borne	19
arms	19
in	19
the	19
world.	19
I	19
conjure	19
thee,	19
by	19
what	19
thou	19
owest	19
to	19
thy	19
most	19
loyal	19
goodness,	19
that	19
thou	19
wilt	19
become	19
my	19
kind	19
intercessor	19
with	19
thy	19
master,	19
that	19
he	19
speedily	19
give	19
aid	19
to	19
this	19
most	19
humble	19
and	19
most	19
unfortunate	19
countess.”	19
To	19
this	19
Sancho	19
made	19
answer,	19
“As	19
to	19
my	19
goodness,	19
señora,	19
being	19
as	19
long	19
and	19
as	19
great	19
as	19
your	19
squire’s	19
beard,	19
it	19
matters	19
very	19
little	19
to	19
me;	19
may	19
I	19
have	19
my	19
soul	19
well	19
bearded	19
and	19
moustached	19
when	19
it	19
comes	19
to	19
quit	19
this	19
life,	19
that’s	19
the	19
point;	19
about	19
beards	19
here	19
below	19
I	19
care	19
little	19
or	19
nothing;	19
but	19
without	19
all	19
these	19
blandishments	19
and	19
prayers,	19
I	19
will	19
beg	19
my	19
master	19
(for	19
I	19
know	19
he	19
loves	19
me,	19
and,	19
besides,	19
he	19
has	19
need	19
of	19
me	19
just	19
now	19
for	19
a	19
certain	19
business)	19
to	19
help	19
and	19
aid	19
your	19
worship	19
as	19
far	19
as	19
he	19
can;	19
unpack	19
your	19
woes	19
and	19
lay	19
them	19
before	19
us,	19
and	19
leave	19
us	19
to	19
deal	19
with	19
them,	19
for	19
we’ll	19
be	19
all	19
of	19
one	19
mind.”	19
The	19
duke	19
and	19
duchess,	19
as	19
it	19
was	19
they	19
who	19
had	19
made	19
the	19
experiment	19
of	19
this	19
adventure,	19
were	19
ready	19
to	19
burst	19
with	19
laughter	19
at	19
all	19
this,	19
and	19
between	19
themselves	19
they	19
commended	19
the	19
clever	19
acting	19
of	19
the	19
Trifaldi,	19
who,	19
returning	19
to	19
her	19
seat,	19
said,	19
“Queen	19
Doña	19
Maguncia	19
reigned	19
over	19
the	19
famous	19
kingdom	19
of	19
Kandy,	19
which	19
lies	19
between	19
the	19
great	19
Trapobana	19
and	19
the	19
Southern	19
Sea,	19
two	19
leagues	19
beyond	19
Cape	19
Comorin.	19
She	19
was	19
the	19
widow	19
of	19
King	19
Archipiela,	19
her	19
lord	19
and	19
husband,	19
and	19
of	19
their	19
marriage	19
they	19
had	19
issue	19
the	19
Princess	19
Antonomasia,	19
heiress	19
of	19
the	19
kingdom;	19
which	19
Princess	19
Antonomasia	19
was	19
reared	19
and	19
brought	19
up	19
under	19
my	19
care	19
and	19
direction,	19
I	19
being	19
the	19
oldest	19
and	19
highest	19
in	19
rank	19
of	19
her	19
mother’s	19
duennas.	19
Time	19
passed,	19
and	19
the	19
young	19
Antonomasia	19
reached	19
the	19
age	19
of	19
fourteen,	19
and	19
such	19
a	19
perfection	19
of	19
beauty,	19
that	19
nature	19
could	19
not	19
raise	19
it	19
higher.	19
Then,	19
it	19
must	19
not	19
be	19
supposed	19
her	19
intelligence	19
was	19
childish;	19
she	19
was	19
as	19
intelligent	19
as	19
she	19
was	19
fair,	19
and	19
she	19
was	19
fairer	19
than	19
all	19
the	19
world;	19
and	19
is	19
so	19
still,	19
unless	19
the	19
envious	19
fates	19
and	19
hard-hearted	19
sisters	19
three	19
have	19
cut	19
for	19
her	19
the	19
thread	19
of	19
life.	19
But	19
that	19
they	19
have	19
not,	19
for	19
Heaven	19
will	19
not	19
suffer	19
so	19
great	19
a	19
wrong	19
to	19
Earth,	19
as	19
it	19
would	19
be	19
to	19
pluck	19
unripe	19
the	19
grapes	19
of	19
the	19
fairest	19
vineyard	19
on	19
its	19
surface.	19
Of	19
this	19
beauty,	19
to	19
which	19
my	19
poor	19
feeble	19
tongue	19
has	19
failed	19
to	19
do	19
justice,	19
countless	19
princes,	19
not	19
only	19
of	19
that	19
country,	19
but	19
of	19
others,	19
were	19
enamoured,	19
and	19
among	19
them	19
a	19
private	19
gentleman,	19
who	19
was	19
at	19
the	19
court,	19
dared	19
to	19
raise	19
his	19
thoughts	19
to	19
the	19
heaven	19
of	19
so	19
great	19
beauty,	19
trusting	19
to	19
his	19
youth,	19
his	19
gallant	19
bearing,	19
his	19
numerous	19
accomplishments	19
and	19
graces,	19
and	19
his	19
quickness	19
and	19
readiness	19
of	19
wit;	19
for	19
I	19
may	19
tell	19
your	19
highnesses,	19
if	19
I	19
am	19
not	19
wearying	19
you,	19
that	19
he	19
played	19
the	19
guitar	19
so	19
as	19
to	19
make	19
it	19
speak,	19
and	19
he	19
was,	19
besides,	19
a	19
poet	19
and	19
a	19
great	19
dancer,	19
and	19
he	19
could	19
make	19
birdcages	19
so	19
well,	19
that	19
by	19
making	19
them	19
alone	19
he	19
might	19
have	19
gained	19
a	19
livelihood,	19
had	19
he	19
found	19
himself	19
reduced	19
to	19
utter	19
poverty;	19
and	19
gifts	19
and	19
graces	19
of	19
this	19
kind	19
are	19
enough	19
to	19
bring	19
down	19
a	19
mountain,	19
not	19
to	19
say	19
a	19
tender	19
young	19
girl.	19
But	19
all	19
his	19
gallantry,	19
wit,	19
and	19
gaiety,	19
all	19
his	19
graces	19
and	19
accomplishments,	19
would	19
have	19
been	19
of	19
little	19
or	19
no	19
avail	19
towards	19
gaining	19
the	19
fortress	19
of	19
my	19
pupil,	19
had	19
not	19
the	19
impudent	19
thief	19
taken	19
the	19
precaution	19
of	19
gaining	19
me	19
over	19
first.	19
First,	19
the	19
villain	19
and	19
heartless	19
vagabond	19
sought	19
to	19
win	19
my	19
good-will	19
and	19
purchase	19
my	19
compliance,	19
so	19
as	19
to	19
get	19
me,	19
like	19
a	19
treacherous	19
warder,	19
to	19
deliver	19
up	19
to	19
him	19
the	19
keys	19
of	19
the	19
fortress	19
I	19
had	19
in	19
charge.	19
In	19
a	19
word,	19
he	19
gained	19
an	19
influence	19
over	19
my	19
mind,	19
and	19
overcame	19
my	19
resolutions	19
with	19
I	19
know	19
not	19
what	19
trinkets	19
and	19
jewels	19
he	19
gave	19
me;	19
but	19
it	19
was	19
some	19
verses	19
I	19
heard	19
him	19
singing	19
one	19
night	19
from	19
a	19
grating	19
that	19
opened	19
on	19
the	19
street	19
where	19
he	19
lived,	19
that,	19
more	19
than	19
anything	19
else,	19
made	19
me	19
give	19
way	19
and	19
led	19
to	19
my	19
fall;	19
and	19
if	19
I	19
remember	19
rightly	19
they	19
ran	19
thus:	19
From	19
that	19
sweet	19
enemy	19
of	19
mine	19
My	19
bleeding	19
heart	19
hath	19
had	19
its	19
wound;	19
And	19
to	19
increase	19
the	19
pain	19
I’m	19
bound	19
To	19
suffer	19
and	19
to	19
make	19
no	19
sign.	19
The	19
lines	19
seemed	19
pearls	19
to	19
me	19
and	19
his	19
voice	19
sweet	19
as	19
syrup;	19
and	19
afterwards,	19
I	19
may	19
say	19
ever	19
since	19
then,	19
looking	19
at	19
the	19
misfortune	19
into	19
which	19
I	19
have	19
fallen,	19
I	19
have	19
thought	19
that	19
poets,	19
as	19
Plato	19
advised,	19
ought	19
to	19
be	19
banished	19
from	19
all	19
well-ordered	19
States;	19
at	19
least	19
the	19
amatory	19
ones,	19
for	19
they	19
write	19
verses,	19
not	19
like	19
those	19
of	19
‘The	19
Marquis	19
of	19
Mantua,’	19
that	19
delight	19
and	19
draw	19
tears	19
from	19
the	19
women	19
and	19
children,	19
but	19
sharp-pointed	19
conceits	19
that	19
pierce	19
the	19
heart	19
like	19
soft	19
thorns,	19
and	19
like	19
the	19
lightning	19
strike	19
it,	19
leaving	19
the	19
raiment	19
uninjured.	19
Another	19
time	19
he	19
sang:	19
Come	19
Death,	19
so	19
subtly	19
veiled	19
that	19
I	19
Thy	19
coming	19
know	19
not,	19
how	19
or	19
when,	19
Lest	19
it	19
should	19
give	19
me	19
life	19
again	19
To	19
find	19
how	19
sweet	19
it	19
is	19
to	19
die.	19
—and	19
other	19
verses	19
and	19
burdens	19
of	19
the	19
same	19
sort,	19
such	19
as	19
enchant	19
when	19
sung	19
and	19
fascinate	19
when	19
written.	19
And	19
then,	19
when	19
they	19
condescend	19
to	19
compose	19
a	19
sort	19
of	19
verse	19
that	19
was	19
at	19
that	19
time	19
in	19
vogue	19
in	19
Kandy,	19
which	19
they	19
call	19
seguidillas!	19
Then	19
it	19
is	19
that	19
hearts	19
leap	19
and	19
laughter	19
breaks	19
forth,	19
and	19
the	19
body	19
grows	19
restless	19
and	19
all	19
the	19
senses	19
turn	19
quicksilver.	19
And	19
so	19
I	19
say,	19
sirs,	19
that	19
these	19
troubadours	19
richly	19
deserve	19
to	19
be	19
banished	19
to	19
the	19
isles	19
of	19
the	19
lizards.	19
Though	19
it	19
is	19
not	19
they	19
that	19
are	19
in	19
fault,	19
but	19
the	19
simpletons	19
that	19
extol	19
them,	19
and	19
the	19
fools	19
that	19
believe	19
in	19
them;	19
and	19
had	19
I	19
been	19
the	19
faithful	19
duenna	19
I	19
should	19
have	19
been,	19
his	19
stale	19
conceits	19
would	19
have	19
never	19
moved	19
me,	19
nor	19
should	19
I	19
have	19
been	19
taken	19
in	19
by	19
such	19
phrases	19
as	19
‘in	19
death	19
I	19
live,’	19
‘in	19
ice	19
I	19
burn,’	19
‘in	19
flames	19
I	19
shiver,’	19
‘hopeless	19
I	19
hope,’	19
‘I	19
go	19
and	19
stay,’	19
and	19
paradoxes	19
of	19
that	19
sort	19
which	19
their	19
writings	19
are	19
full	19
of.	19
And	19
then	19
when	19
they	19
promise	19
the	19
Phœnix	19
of	19
Arabia,	19
the	19
crown	19
of	19
Ariadne,	19
the	19
horses	19
of	19
the	19
Sun,	19
the	19
pearls	19
of	19
the	19
South,	19
the	19
gold	19
of	19
Tibar,	19
and	19
the	19
balsam	19
of	19
Panchaia!	19
Then	19
it	19
is	19
they	19
give	19
a	19
loose	19
to	19
their	19
pens,	19
for	19
it	19
costs	19
them	19
little	19
to	19
make	19
promises	19
they	19
have	19
no	19
intention	19
or	19
power	19
of	19
fulfilling.	19
But	19
where	19
am	19
I	19
wandering	19
to?	19
Woe	19
is	19
me,	19
unfortunate	19
being!	19
What	19
madness	19
or	19
folly	19
leads	19
me	19
to	19
speak	19
of	19
the	19
faults	19
of	19
others,	19
when	19
there	19
is	19
so	19
much	19
to	19
be	19
said	19
about	19
my	19
own?	19
Again,	19
woe	19
is	19
me,	19
hapless	19
that	19
I	19
am!	19
it	19
was	19
not	19
verses	19
that	19
conquered	19
me,	19
but	19
my	19
own	19
simplicity;	19
it	19
was	19
not	19
music	19
made	19
me	19
yield,	19
but	19
my	19
own	19
imprudence;	19
my	19
own	19
great	19
ignorance	19
and	19
little	19
caution	19
opened	19
the	19
way	19
and	19
cleared	19
the	19
path	19
for	19
Don	19
Clavijo’s	19
advances,	19
for	19
that	19
was	19
the	19
name	19
of	19
the	19
gentleman	19
I	19
have	19
referred	19
to;	19
and	19
so,	19
with	19
my	19
help	19
as	19
go-between,	19
he	19
found	19
his	19
way	19
many	19
a	19
time	19
into	19
the	19
chamber	19
of	19
the	19
deceived	19
Antonomasia	19
(deceived	19
not	19
by	19
him	19
but	19
by	19
me)	19
under	19
the	19
title	19
of	19
a	19
lawful	19
husband;	19
for,	19
sinner	19
though	19
I	19
was,	19
would	19
not	19
have	19
allowed	19
him	19
to	19
approach	19
the	19
edge	19
of	19
her	19
shoe-sole	19
without	19
being	19
her	19
husband.	19
No,	19
no,	19
not	19
that;	19
marriage	19
must	19
come	19
first	19
in	19
any	19
business	19
of	19
this	19
sort	19
that	19
I	19
take	19
in	19
hand.	19
But	19
there	19
was	19
one	19
hitch	19
in	19
this	19
case,	19
which	19
was	19
that	19
of	19
inequality	19
of	19
rank,	19
Don	19
Clavijo	19
being	19
a	19
private	19
gentleman,	19
and	19
the	19
Princess	19
Antonomasia,	19
as	19
I	19
said,	19
heiress	19
to	19
the	19
kingdom.	19
The	19
entanglement	19
remained	19
for	19
some	19
time	19
a	19
secret,	19
kept	19
hidden	19
by	19
my	19
cunning	19
precautions,	19
until	19
I	19
perceived	19
that	19
a	19
certain	19
expansion	19
of	19
waist	19
in	19
Antonomasia	19
must	19
before	19
long	19
disclose	19
it,	19
the	19
dread	19
of	19
which	19
made	19
us	19
all	19
there	19
take	19
counsel	19
together,	19
and	19
it	19
was	19
agreed	19
that	19
before	19
the	19
mischief	19
came	19
to	19
light,	19
Don	19
Clavijo	19
should	19
demand	19
Antonomasia	19
as	19
his	19
wife	19
before	19
the	19
Vicar,	19
in	19
virtue	19
of	19
an	19
agreement	19
to	19
marry	19
him	19
made	19
by	19
the	19
princess,	19
and	19
drafted	19
by	19
my	19
wit	19
in	19
such	19
binding	19
terms	19
that	19
the	19
might	19
of	19
Samson	19
could	19
not	19
have	19
broken	19
it.	19
The	19
necessary	19
steps	19
were	19
taken;	19
the	19
Vicar	19
saw	19
the	19
agreement,	19
and	19
took	19
the	19
lady’s	19
confession;	19
she	19
confessed	19
everything	19
in	19
full,	19
and	19
he	19
ordered	19
her	19
into	19
the	19
custody	19
of	19
a	19
very	19
worthy	19
alguacil	19
of	19
the	19
court.”	19
“Are	19
there	19
alguacils	19
of	19
the	19
court	19
in	19
Kandy,	19
too,”	19
said	19
Sancho	19
at	19
this,	19
“and	19
poets,	19
and	19
seguidillas?	19
I	19
swear	19
I	19
think	19
the	19
world	19
is	19
the	19
same	19
all	19
over!	19
But	19
make	19
haste,	19
Señora	19
Trifaldi;	19
for	19
it	19
is	19
late,	19
and	19
I	19
am	19
dying	19
to	19
know	19
the	19
end	19
of	19
this	19
long	19
story.”	19
“I	19
will,”	19
replied	19
the	19
countess.	19

One	19
went	19
on	19
to	19
say:	19
“At	19
length,	19
after	19
much	19
questioning	19
and	19
answering,	19
as	19
the	19
princess	19
held	19
to	19
her	19
story,	19
without	19
changing	19
or	19
varying	19
her	19
previous	19
declaration,	19
the	19
Vicar	19
gave	19
his	19
decision	19
in	19
favour	19
of	19
Don	19
Clavijo,	19
and	19
she	19
was	19
delivered	19
over	19
to	19
him	19
as	19
his	19
lawful	19
wife;	19
which	19
the	19
Queen	19
Doña	19
Maguncia,	19
the	19
Princess	19
Antonomasia’s	19
mother,	19
so	19
took	19
to	19
heart,	19
that	19
within	19
the	19
space	19
of	19
three	19
days	19
we	19
buried	19
her.”	19
“She	19
died,	19
no	19
doubt,”	19
said	19
Sancho.	19
“Of	19
course,”	19
said	19
Trifaldin;	19
“they	19
don’t	19
bury	19
living	19
people	19
in	19
Kandy,	19
only	19
the	19
dead.”	19
“Señor	19
Squire,”	19
said	19
Sancho,	19
“a	19
man	19
in	19
a	19
swoon	19
has	19
been	19
known	19
to	19
be	19
buried	19
before	19
now,	19
in	19
the	19
belief	19
that	19
he	19
was	19
dead;	19
and	19
it	19
struck	19
me	19
that	19
Queen	19
Maguncia	19
ought	19
to	19
have	19
swooned	19
rather	19
than	19
died;	19
because	19
with	19
life	19
a	19
great	19
many	19
things	19
come	19
right,	19
and	19
the	19
princess’s	19
folly	19
was	19
not	19
so	19
great	19
that	19
she	19
need	19
feel	19
it	19
so	19
keenly.	19
If	19
the	19
lady	19
had	19
married	19
some	19
page	19
of	19
hers,	19
or	19
some	19
other	19
servant	19
of	19
the	19
house,	19
as	19
many	19
another	19
has	19
done,	19
so	19
I	19
have	19
heard	19
say,	19
then	19
the	19
mischief	19
would	19
have	19
been	19
past	19
curing.	19
But	19
to	19
marry	19
such	19
an	19
elegant	19
accomplished	19
gentleman	19
as	19
has	19
been	19
just	19
now	19
described	19
to	19
us—indeed,	19
indeed,	19
though	19
it	19
was	19
a	19
folly,	19
it	19
was	19
not	19
such	19
a	19
great	19
one	19
as	19
you	19
think;	19
for	19
according	19
to	19
the	19
rules	19
of	19
my	19
master	19
here—and	19
he	19
won’t	19
allow	19
me	19
to	19
lie—as	19
of	19
men	19
of	19
letters	19
bishops	19
are	19
made,	19
so	19
of	19
gentlemen	19
knights,	19
specially	19
if	19
they	19
be	19
errant,	19
kings	19
and	19
emperors	19
may	19
be	19
made.”	19
“Thou	19
art	19
right,	19
Sancho,”	19
said	19
Don	19
Quixote,	19
“for	19
with	19
a	19
knight-errant,	19
if	19
he	19
has	19
but	19
two	19
fingers’	19
breadth	19
of	19
good	19
fortune,	19
it	19
is	19
on	19
the	19
cards	19
to	19
become	19
the	19
mightiest	19
lord	19
on	19
earth.	19
But	19
let	19
señora	19
the	19
Distressed	19
One	19
proceed;	19
for	19
I	19
suspect	19
she	19
has	19
got	19
yet	19
to	19
tell	19
us	19
the	19
bitter	19
part	19
of	19
this	19
so	19
far	19
sweet	19
story.”	19
“The	19
bitter	19
is	19
indeed	19
to	19
come,”	19
said	19
the	19
countess;	19
“and	19
such	19
bitter	19
that	19
colocynth	19
is	19
sweet	19
and	19
oleander	19
toothsome	19
in	19
comparison.	19
The	19
queen,	19
then,	19
being	19
dead,	19
and	19
not	19
in	19
a	19
swoon,	19
we	19
buried	19
her;	19
and	19
hardly	19
had	19
we	19
covered	19
her	19
with	19
earth,	19
hardly	19
had	19
we	19
said	19
our	19
last	19
farewells,	19
when,	19
_quis	19
talia	19
fando	19
temperet	19
a	19
lachrymis?_	19
over	19
the	19
queen’s	19
grave	19
there	19
appeared,	19
mounted	19
upon	19
a	19
wooden	19
horse,	19
the	19
giant	19
Malambruno,	19
Maguncia’s	19
first	19
cousin,	19
who	19
besides	19
being	19
cruel	19
is	19
an	19
enchanter;	19
and	19
he,	19
to	19
revenge	19
the	19
death	19
of	19
his	19
cousin,	19
punish	19
the	19
audacity	19
of	19
Don	19
Clavijo,	19
and	19
in	19
wrath	19
at	19
the	19
contumacy	19
of	19
Antonomasia,	19
left	19
them	19
both	19
enchanted	19
by	19
his	19
art	19
on	19
the	19
grave	19
itself;	19
she	19
being	19
changed	19
into	19
an	19
ape	19
of	19
brass,	19
and	19
he	19
into	19
a	19
horrible	19
crocodile	19
of	19
some	19
unknown	19
metal;	19
while	19
between	19
the	19
two	19
there	19
stands	19
a	19
pillar,	19
also	19
of	19
metal,	19
with	19
certain	19
characters	19
in	19
the	19
Syriac	19
language	19
inscribed	19
upon	19
it,	19
which,	19
being	19
translated	19
into	19
Kandian,	19
and	19
now	19
into	19
Castilian,	19
contain	19
the	19
following	19
sentence:	19
‘These	19
two	19
rash	19
lovers	19
shall	19
not	19
recover	19
their	19
former	19
shape	19
until	19
the	19
valiant	19
Manchegan	19
comes	19
to	19
do	19
battle	19
with	19
me	19
in	19
single	19
combat;	19
for	19
the	19
Fates	19
reserve	19
this	19
unexampled	19
adventure	19
for	19
his	19
mighty	19
valour	19
alone.’	19
This	19
done,	19
he	19
drew	19
from	19
its	19
sheath	19
a	19
huge	19
broad	19
scimitar,	19
and	19
seizing	19
me	19
by	19
the	19
hair	19
he	19
made	19
as	19
though	19
he	19
meant	19
to	19
cut	19
my	19
throat	19
and	19
shear	19
my	19
head	19
clean	19
off.	19
I	19
was	19
terror-stricken,	19
my	19
voice	19
stuck	19
in	19
my	19
throat,	19
and	19
I	19
was	19
in	19
the	19
deepest	19
distress;	19
nevertheless	19
I	19
summoned	19
up	19
my	19
strength	19
as	19
well	19
as	19
I	19
could,	19
and	19
in	19
a	19
trembling	19
and	19
piteous	19
voice	19
I	19
addressed	19
such	19
words	19
to	19
him	19
as	19
induced	19
him	19
to	19
stay	19
the	19
infliction	19
of	19
a	19
punishment	19
so	19
severe.	19
He	19
then	19
caused	19
all	19
the	19
duennas	19
of	19
the	19
palace,	19
those	19
that	19
are	19
here	19
present,	19
to	19
be	19
brought	19
before	19
him;	19
and	19
after	19
having	19
dwelt	19
upon	19
the	19
enormity	19
of	19
our	19
offence,	19
and	19
denounced	19
duennas,	19
their	19
characters,	19
their	19
evil	19
ways	19
and	19
worse	19
intrigues,	19
laying	19
to	19
the	19
charge	19
of	19
all	19
what	19
I	19
alone	19
was	19
guilty	19
of,	19
he	19
said	19
he	19
would	19
not	19
visit	19
us	19
with	19
capital	19
punishment,	19
but	19
with	19
others	19
of	19
a	19
slow	19
nature	19
which	19
would	19
be	19
in	19
effect	19
civil	19
death	19
for	19
ever;	19
and	19
the	19
very	19
instant	19
he	19
ceased	19
speaking	19
we	19
all	19
felt	19
the	19
pores	19
of	19
our	19
faces	19
opening,	19
and	19
pricking	19
us,	19
as	19
if	19
with	19
the	19
points	19
of	19
needles.	19
We	19
at	19
once	19
put	19
our	19
hands	19
up	19
to	19
our	19
faces	19
and	19
found	19
ourselves	19
in	19
the	19
state	19
you	19
now	19
see.”	19
Here	19
the	19
Distressed	19
One	19
and	19
the	19
other	19
duennas	19
raised	19
the	19
veils	19
with	19
which	19
they	19
were	19
covered,	19
and	19
disclosed	19
countenances	19
all	19
bristling	19
with	19
beards,	19
some	19
red,	19
some	19
black,	19
some	19
white,	19
and	19
some	19
grizzled,	19
at	19
which	19
spectacle	19
the	19
duke	19
and	19
duchess	19
made	19
a	19
show	19
of	19
being	19
filled	19
with	19
wonder.	19
Don	19
Quixote	19
and	19
Sancho	19
were	19
overwhelmed	19
with	19
amazement,	19
and	19
the	19
bystanders	19
lost	19
in	19
astonishment,	19
while	19
the	19
Trifaldi	19
went	19
on	19
to	19
say:	19
“Thus	19
did	19
that	19
malevolent	19
villain	19
Malambruno	19
punish	19
us,	19
covering	19
the	19
tenderness	19
and	19
softness	19
of	19
our	19
faces	19
with	19
these	19
rough	19
bristles!	19
Would	19
to	19
heaven	19
that	19
he	19
had	19
swept	19
off	19
our	19
heads	19
with	19
his	19
enormous	19
scimitar	19
instead	19
of	19
obscuring	19
the	19
light	19
of	19
our	19
countenances	19
with	19
these	19
wool-combings	19
that	19
cover	19
us!	19
For	19
if	19
we	19
look	19
into	19
the	19
matter,	19
sirs	19
(and	19
what	19
I	19
am	19
now	19
going	19
to	19
say	19
I	19
would	19
say	19
with	19
eyes	19
flowing	19
like	19
fountains,	19
only	19
that	19
the	19
thought	19
of	19
our	19
misfortune	19
and	19
the	19
oceans	19
they	19
have	19
already	19
wept,	19
keep	19
them	19
as	19
dry	19
as	19
barley	19
spears,	19
and	19
so	19
I	19
say	19
it	19
without	19
tears),	19
where,	19
I	19
ask,	19
can	19
a	19
duenna	19
with	19
a	19
beard	19
go	19
to?	19
What	19
father	19
or	19
mother	19
will	19
feel	19
pity	19
for	19
her?	19
Who	19
will	19
help	19
her?	19
For,	19
if	19
even	19
when	19
she	19
has	19
a	19
smooth	19
skin,	19
and	19
a	19
face	19
tortured	19
by	19
a	19
thousand	19
kinds	19
of	19
washes	19
and	19
cosmetics,	19
she	19
can	19
hardly	19
get	19
anybody	19
to	19
love	19
her,	19
what	19
will	19
she	19
do	19
when	19
she	19
shows	19
a	19
countenance	19
turned	19
into	19
a	19
thicket?	19
Oh	19
duennas,	19
companions	19
mine!	19
it	19
was	19
an	19
unlucky	19
moment	19
when	19
we	19
were	19
born	19
and	19
an	19
ill-starred	19
hour	19
when	19
our	19
fathers	19
begot	19
us!”	19
And	19
as	19
she	19
said	19
this	19
she	19
showed	19
signs	19
of	19
being	19
about	19
to	19
faint.	19

O	19
renowned	19

O	19
happy	19
Don	19
Quixote!	19
O	19
famous	20
droll	20
Sancho!	20
All	20
and	20
each,	20
may	20
ye	20
live	20
countless	20
ages	20
for	20
the	20
delight	20
and	20
amusement	20
of	20
the	20
dwellers	20
on	20
earth!	20
The	20
history	20
goes	20
on	20
to	20
say	20
that	20
when	20
Sancho	20
saw	20
the	20
Distressed	20
One	20
faint	20
he	20
exclaimed:	20
“I	20
swear	20
by	20
the	20
faith	20
of	20
an	20
honest	20
man	20
and	20
the	20
shades	20
of	20
all	20
my	20
ancestors	20
the	20
Panzas,	20
that	20
never	20
I	20
did	20
see	20
or	20
hear	20
of,	20
nor	20
has	20
my	20
master	20
related	20
or	20
conceived	20
in	20
his	20
mind,	20
such	20
an	20
adventure	20
as	20
this.	20
A	20
thousand	20
devils—not	20
to	20
curse	20
thee—take	20
thee,	20
Malambruno,	20
for	20
an	20
enchanter	20
and	20
a	20
giant!	20
Couldst	20
thou	20
find	20
no	20
other	20
sort	20
of	20
punishment	20
for	20
these	20
sinners	20
but	20
bearding	20
them?	20
Would	20
it	20
not	20
have	20
been	20
better—it	20
would	20
have	20
been	20
better	20
for	20
them—to	20
have	20
taken	20
off	20
half	20
their	20
noses	20
from	20
the	20
middle	20
upwards,	20
even	20
though	20
they’d	20
have	20
snuffled	20
when	20
they	20
spoke,	20
than	20
to	20
have	20
put	20
beards	20
on	20
them?	20
I’ll	20
bet	20
they	20
have	20
not	20
the	20
means	20
of	20
paying	20
anybody	20
to	20
shave	20
them.”	20
“That	20
is	20
the	20
truth,	20
señor,”	20
said	20
one	20
of	20
the	20
twelve;	20
“we	20
have	20
not	20
the	20
money	20
to	20
get	20
ourselves	20
shaved,	20
and	20
so	20
we	20
have,	20
some	20
of	20
us,	20
taken	20
to	20
using	20
sticking-plasters	20
by	20
way	20
of	20
an	20
economical	20
remedy,	20
for	20
by	20
applying	20
them	20
to	20
our	20
faces	20
and	20
plucking	20
them	20
off	20
with	20
a	20
jerk	20
we	20
are	20
left	20
as	20
bare	20
and	20
smooth	20
as	20
the	20
bottom	20
of	20
a	20
stone	20
mortar.	20
There	20
are,	20
to	20
be	20
sure,	20
women	20
in	20
Kandy	20
that	20
go	20
about	20
from	20
house	20
to	20
house	20
to	20
remove	20
down,	20
and	20
trim	20
eyebrows,	20
and	20
make	20
cosmetics	20
for	20
the	20
use	20
of	20
the	20
women,	20
but	20
we,	20
the	20
duennas	20
of	20
my	20
lady,	20
would	20
never	20
let	20
them	20
in,	20
for	20
most	20
of	20
them	20
have	20
a	20
flavour	20
of	20
agents	20
that	20
have	20
ceased	20
to	20
be	20
principals;	20
and	20
if	20
we	20
are	20
not	20
relieved	20
by	20
Señor	20
Don	20
Quixote	20
we	20
shall	20
be	20
carried	20
to	20
our	20
graves	20
with	20
beards.”	20
“I	20
will	20
pluck	20
out	20
my	20
own	20
in	20
the	20
land	20
of	20
the	20
Moors,”	20
said	20
Don	20
Quixote,	20
“if	20
I	20
don’t	20
cure	20
yours.”	20
At	20
this	20
instant	20
the	20
Trifaldi	20
recovered	20
from	20
her	20
swoon	20
and	20
said,	20
“The	20
chink	20
of	20
that	20
promise,	20
valiant	20
knight,	20
reached	20
my	20
ears	20
in	20
the	20
midst	20
of	20
my	20
swoon,	20
and	20
has	20
been	20
the	20
means	20
of	20
reviving	20
me	20
and	20
bringing	20
back	20
my	20
senses;	20
and	20
so	20
once	20
more	20
I	20
implore	20
you,	20
illustrious	20
errant,	20
indomitable	20
sir,	20
to	20
let	20
your	20
gracious	20
promises	20
be	20
turned	20
into	20
deeds.”	20
“There	20
shall	20
be	20
no	20
delay	20
on	20
my	20
part,”	20
said	20
Don	20
Quixote.	20
“Bethink	20
you,	20
señora,	20
of	20
what	20
I	20
must	20
do,	20
for	20
my	20
heart	20
is	20
most	20
eager	20
to	20
serve	20
you.”	20
“The	20
fact	20
is,”	20
replied	20
the	20
Distressed	20
One,	20
“it	20
is	20
five	20
thousand	20
leagues,	20
a	20
couple	20
more	20
or	20
less,	20
from	20
this	20
to	20
the	20
kingdom	20
of	20
Kandy,	20
if	20
you	20
go	20
by	20
land;	20
but	20
if	20
you	20
go	20
through	20
the	20
air	20
and	20
in	20
a	20
straight	20
line,	20
it	20
is	20
three	20
thousand	20
two	20
hundred	20
and	20
twenty-seven.	20
You	20
must	20
know,	20
too,	20
that	20
Malambruno	20
told	20
me	20
that,	20
whenever	20
fate	20
provided	20
the	20
knight	20
our	20
deliverer,	20
he	20
himself	20
would	20
send	20
him	20
a	20
steed	20
far	20
better	20
and	20
with	20
less	20
tricks	20
than	20
a	20
post-horse;	20
for	20
he	20
will	20
be	20
that	20
same	20
wooden	20
horse	20
on	20
which	20
the	20
valiant	20
Pierres	20
carried	20
off	20
the	20
fair	20
Magalona;	20
which	20
said	20
horse	20
is	20
guided	20
by	20
a	20
peg	20
he	20
has	20
in	20
his	20
forehead	20
that	20
serves	20
for	20
a	20
bridle,	20
and	20
flies	20
through	20
the	20
air	20
with	20
such	20
rapidity	20
that	20
you	20
would	20
fancy	20
the	20
very	20
devils	20
were	20
carrying	20
him.	20
This	20
horse,	20
according	20
to	20
ancient	20
tradition,	20
was	20
made	20
by	20
Merlin.	20
He	20
lent	20
him	20
to	20
Pierres,	20
who	20
was	20
a	20
friend	20
of	20
his,	20
and	20
who	20
made	20
long	20
journeys	20
with	20
him,	20
and,	20
as	20
has	20
been	20
said,	20
carried	20
off	20
the	20
fair	20
Magalona,	20
bearing	20
her	20
through	20
the	20
air	20
on	20
its	20
haunches	20
and	20
making	20
all	20
who	20
beheld	20
them	20
from	20
the	20
earth	20
gape	20
with	20
astonishment;	20
and	20
he	20
never	20
lent	20
him	20
save	20
to	20
those	20
whom	20
he	20
loved	20
or	20
those	20
who	20
paid	20
him	20
well;	20
and	20
since	20
the	20
great	20
Pierres	20
we	20
know	20
of	20
no	20
one	20
having	20
mounted	20
him	20
until	20
now.	20
From	20
him	20
Malambruno	20
stole	20
him	20
by	20
his	20
magic	20
art,	20
and	20
he	20
has	20
him	20
now	20
in	20
his	20
possession,	20
and	20
makes	20
use	20
of	20
him	20
in	20
his	20
journeys	20
which	20
he	20
constantly	20
makes	20
through	20
different	20
parts	20
of	20
the	20
world;	20
he	20
is	20
here	20
to-day,	20
to-morrow	20
in	20
France,	20
and	20
the	20
next	20
day	20
in	20
Potosi;	20
and	20
the	20
best	20
of	20
it	20
is	20
the	20
said	20
horse	20
neither	20
eats	20
nor	20
sleeps	20
nor	20
wears	20
out	20
shoes,	20
and	20
goes	20
at	20
an	20
ambling	20
pace	20
through	20
the	20
air	20
without	20
wings,	20
so	20
that	20
he	20
whom	20
he	20
has	20
mounted	20
upon	20
him	20
can	20
carry	20
a	20
cup	20
full	20
of	20
water	20
in	20
his	20
hand	20
without	20
spilling	20
a	20
drop,	20
so	20
smoothly	20
and	20
easily	20
does	20
he	20
go,	20
for	20
which	20
reason	20
the	20
fair	20
Magalona	20
enjoyed	20
riding	20
him	20
greatly.”	20
“For	20
going	20
smoothly	20
and	20
easily,”	20
said	20
Sancho	20
at	20
this,	20
“give	20
me	20
my	20
Dapple,	20
though	20
he	20
can’t	20
go	20
through	20
the	20
air;	20
but	20
on	20
the	20
ground	20
I’ll	20
back	20
him	20
against	20
all	20
the	20
amblers	20
in	20
the	20
world.”	20
They	20
all	20
laughed,	20
and	20
the	20
Distressed	20
One	20
continued:	20
“And	20
this	20
same	20
horse,	20
if	20
so	20
be	20
that	20
Malambruno	20
is	20
disposed	20
to	20
put	20
an	20
end	20
to	20
our	20
sufferings,	20
will	20
be	20
here	20
before	20
us	20
ere	20
the	20
night	20
shall	20
have	20
advanced	20
half	20
an	20
hour;	20
for	20
he	20
announced	20
to	20
me	20
that	20
the	20
sign	20
he	20
would	20
give	20
me	20
whereby	20
I	20
might	20
know	20
that	20
I	20
had	20
found	20
the	20
knight	20
I	20
was	20
in	20
quest	20
of,	20
would	20
be	20
to	20
send	20
me	20
the	20
horse	20
wherever	20
he	20
might	20
be,	20
speedily	20
and	20
promptly.”	20
“And	20
how	20
many	20
is	20
there	20
room	20
for	20
on	20
this	20
horse?”	20
asked	20
Sancho.	20
“Two,”	20
said	20
the	20
Distressed	20
One,	20
“one	20
in	20
the	20
saddle,	20
and	20
the	20
other	20
on	20
the	20
croup;	20
and	20
generally	20
these	20
two	20
are	20
knight	20
and	20
squire,	20
when	20
there	20
is	20
no	20
damsel	20
that’s	20
being	20
carried	20
off.”	20
“I’d	20
like	20
to	20
know,	20
Señora	20
Distressed	20
One,”	20
said	20
Sancho,	20
“what	20
is	20
the	20
name	20
of	20
this	20
horse?”	20
“His	20
name,”	20
said	20
the	20
Distressed	20
One,	20
“is	20
not	20
the	20
same	20
as	20
Bellerophon’s	20
horse	20
that	20
was	20
called	20
Pegasus,	20
or	20
Alexander	20
the	20
Great’s,	20
called	20
Bucephalus,	20
or	20
Orlando	20
Furioso’s,	20
the	20
name	20
of	20
which	20
was	20
Brigliador,	20
nor	20
yet	20
Bayard,	20
the	20
horse	20
of	20
Reinaldos	20
of	20
Montalvan,	20
nor	20
Frontino	20
like	20
Ruggiero’s,	20
nor	20
Bootes	20
or	20
Peritoa,	20
as	20
they	20
say	20
the	20
horses	20
of	20
the	20
sun	20
were	20
called,	20
nor	20
is	20
he	20
called	20
Orelia,	20
like	20
the	20
horse	20
on	20
which	20
the	20
unfortunate	20
Rodrigo,	20
the	20
last	20
king	20
of	20
the	20
Goths,	20
rode	20
to	20
the	20
battle	20
where	20
he	20
lost	20
his	20
life	20
and	20
his	20
kingdom.”	20
“I’ll	20
bet,”	20
said	20
Sancho,	20
“that	20
as	20
they	20
have	20
given	20
him	20
none	20
of	20
these	20
famous	20
names	20
of	20
well-known	20
horses,	20
no	20
more	20
have	20
they	20
given	20
him	20
the	20
name	20
of	20
my	20
master’s	20
Rocinante,	20
which	20
for	20
being	20
apt	20
surpasses	20
all	20
that	20
have	20
been	20
mentioned.”	20
“That	20
is	20
true,”	20
said	20
the	20
bearded	20
countess,	20
“still	20
it	20
fits	20
him	20
very	20
well,	20
for	20
he	20
is	20
called	20
Clavileño	20
the	20
Swift,	20
which	20
name	20
is	20
in	20
accordance	20
with	20
his	20
being	20
made	20
of	20
wood,	20
with	20
the	20
peg	20
he	20
has	20
in	20
his	20
forehead,	20
and	20
with	20
the	20
swift	20
pace	20
at	20
which	20
he	20
travels;	20
and	20
so,	20
as	20
far	20
as	20
name	20
goes,	20
he	20
may	20
compare	20
with	20
the	20
famous	20
Rocinante.”	20
“I	20
have	20
nothing	20
to	20
say	20
against	20
his	20
name,”	20
said	20
Sancho;	20
“but	20
with	20
what	20
sort	20
of	20
bridle	20
or	20
halter	20
is	20
he	20
managed?”	20
“I	20
have	20
said	20
already,”	20
said	20
the	20
Trifaldi,	20
“that	20
it	20
is	20
with	20
a	20
peg,	20
by	20
turning	20
which	20
to	20
one	20
side	20
or	20
the	20
other	20
the	20
knight	20
who	20
rides	20
him	20
makes	20
him	20
go	20
as	20
he	20
pleases,	20
either	20
through	20
the	20
upper	20
air,	20
or	20
skimming	20
and	20
almost	20
sweeping	20
the	20
earth,	20
or	20
else	20
in	20
that	20
middle	20
course	20
that	20
is	20
sought	20
and	20
followed	20
in	20
all	20
well-regulated	20
proceedings.”	20
“I’d	20
like	20
to	20
see	20
him,”	20
said	20
Sancho;	20
“but	20
to	20
fancy	20
I’m	20
going	20
to	20
mount	20
him,	20
either	20
in	20
the	20
saddle	20
or	20
on	20
the	20
croup,	20
is	20
to	20
ask	20
pears	20
of	20
the	20
elm	20
tree.	20
A	20
good	20
joke	20
indeed!	20
I	20
can	20
hardly	20
keep	20
my	20
seat	20
upon	20
Dapple,	20
and	20
on	20
a	20
pack-saddle	20
softer	20
than	20
silk	20
itself,	20
and	20
here	20
they’d	20
have	20
me	20
hold	20
on	20
upon	20
haunches	20
of	20
plank	20
without	20
pad	20
or	20
cushion	20
of	20
any	20
sort!	20
Gad,	20
I	20
have	20
no	20
notion	20
of	20
bruising	20
myself	20
to	20
get	20
rid	20
of	20
anyone’s	20
beard;	20
let	20
each	20
one	20
shave	20
himself	20
as	20
best	20
he	20
can;	20
I’m	20
not	20
going	20
to	20
accompany	20
my	20
master	20
on	20
any	20
such	20
long	20
journey;	20
besides,	20
I	20
can’t	20
give	20
any	20
help	20
to	20
the	20
shaving	20
of	20
these	20
beards	20
as	20
I	20
can	20
to	20
the	20
disenchantment	20
of	20
my	20
lady	20
Dulcinea.”	20
“Yes,	20
you	20
can,	20
my	20
friend,”	20
replied	20
the	20
Trifaldi;	20
“and	20
so	20
much,	20
that	20
without	20
you,	20
so	20
I	20
understand,	20
we	20
shall	20
be	20
able	20
to	20
do	20
nothing.”	20
“In	20
the	20
king’s	20
name!”	20
exclaimed	20
Sancho,	20
“what	20
have	20
squires	20
got	20
to	20
do	20
with	20
the	20
adventures	20
of	20
their	20
masters?	20
Are	20
they	20
to	20
have	20
the	20
fame	20
of	20
such	20
as	20
they	20
go	20
through,	20
and	20
we	20
the	20
labour?	20
Body	20
o’	20
me!	20
if	20
the	20
historians	20
would	20
only	20
say,	20
‘Such	20
and	20
such	20
a	20
knight	20
finished	20
such	20
and	20
such	20
an	20
adventure,	20
but	20
with	20
the	20
help	20
of	20
so	20
and	20
so,	20
his	20
squire,	20
without	20
which	20
it	20
would	20
have	20
been	20
impossible	20
for	20
him	20
to	20
accomplish	20
it;’	20
but	20
they	20
write	20
curtly,	20
“Don	20
Paralipomenon	20
of	20
the	20
Three	20
Stars	20
accomplished	20
the	20
adventure	20
of	20
the	20
six	20
monsters;’	20
without	20
mentioning	20
such	20
a	20
person	20
as	20
his	20
squire,	20
who	20
was	20
there	20
all	20
the	20
time,	20
just	20
as	20
if	20
there	20
was	20
no	20
such	20
being.	20
Once	20
more,	20
sirs,	20
I	20
say	20
my	20
master	20
may	20
go	20
alone,	20
and	20
much	20
good	20
may	20
it	20
do	20
him;	20
and	20
I’ll	20
stay	20
here	20
in	20
the	20
company	20
of	20
my	20
lady	20
the	20
duchess;	20
and	20
maybe	20
when	20
he	20
comes	20
back,	20
he	20
will	20
find	20
the	20
lady	20
Dulcinea’s	20
affair	20
ever	20
so	20
much	20
advanced;	20
for	20
I	20
mean	20
in	20
leisure	20
hours,	20
and	20
at	20
idle	20
moments,	20
to	20
give	20
myself	20
a	20
spell	20
of	20
whipping	20
without	20
so	20
much	20
as	20
a	20
hair	20
to	20
cover	20
me.”	20
“For	20
all	20
that	20
you	20
must	20
go	20
if	20
it	20
be	20
necessary,	20
my	20
good	20
Sancho,”	20
said	20
the	20
duchess,	20
“for	20
they	20
are	20
worthy	20
folk	20
who	20
ask	20
you;	20
and	20
the	20
faces	20
of	20
these	20
ladies	20
must	20
not	20
remain	20
overgrown	20
in	20
this	20
way	20
because	20
of	20
your	20
idle	20
fears;	20
that	20
would	20
be	20
a	20
hard	20
case	20
indeed.”	20
“In	20
the	20
king’s	20
name,	20
once	20
more!”	20
said	20
Sancho;	20
“If	20
this	20
charitable	20
work	20
were	20
to	20
be	20
done	20
for	20
the	20
sake	20
of	20
damsels	20
in	20
confinement	20
or	20
charity-girls,	20
a	20
man	20
might	20
expose	20
himself	20
to	20
some	20
hardships;	20
but	20
to	20
bear	20
it	20
for	20
the	20
sake	20
of	20
stripping	20
beards	20
off	20
duennas!	20
Devil	20
take	20
it!	20
I’d	20
sooner	20
see	20
them	20
all	20
bearded,	20
from	20
the	20
highest	20
to	20
the	20
lowest,	20
and	20
from	20
the	20
most	20
prudish	20
to	20
the	20
most	20
affected.”	20
“You	20
are	20
very	20
hard	20
on	20
duennas,	20
Sancho	20
my	20
friend,”	20
said	20
the	20
duchess;	20
“you	20
incline	20
very	20
much	20
to	20
the	20
opinion	20
of	20
the	20
Toledo	20
apothecary.	20
But	20
indeed	20
you	20
are	20
wrong;	20
there	20
are	20
duennas	20
in	20
my	20
house	20
that	20
may	20
serve	20
as	20
patterns	20
of	20
duennas;	20
and	20
here	20
is	20
my	20
Doña	20
Rodriguez,	20
who	20
will	20
not	20
allow	20
me	20
to	20
say	20
otherwise.”	20
“Your	20
excellence	20
may	20
say	20
it	20
if	20
you	20
like,”	20
said	20
the	20
Rodriguez;	20
“for	20
God	20
knows	20
the	20
truth	20
of	20
everything;	20
and	20
whether	20
we	20
duennas	20
are	20
good	20
or	20
bad,	20
bearded	20
or	20
smooth,	20
we	20
are	20
our	20
mothers’	20
daughters	20
like	20
other	20
women;	20
and	20
as	20
God	20
sent	20
us	20
into	20
the	20
world,	20
he	20
knows	20
why	20
he	20
did,	20
and	20
on	20
his	20
mercy	20
I	20
rely,	20
and	20
not	20
on	20
anybody’s	20
beard.”	20
“Well,	20
Señora	20
Rodriguez,	20
Señora	20
Trifaldi,	20
and	20
present	20
company,”	20
said	20
Don	20
Quixote,	20
“I	20
trust	20
in	20
Heaven	20
that	20
it	20
will	20
look	20
with	20
kindly	20
eyes	20
upon	20
your	20
troubles,	20
for	20
Sancho	20
will	20
do	20
as	20
I	20
bid	20
him.	20
Only	20
let	20
Clavileño	20
come	20
and	20
let	20
me	20
find	20
myself	20
face	20
to	20
face	20
with	20
Malambruno,	20
and	20
I	20
am	20
certain	20
no	20
razor	20
will	20
shave	20
you	20
more	20
easily	20
than	20
my	20
sword	20
shall	20
shave	20
Malambruno’s	20
head	20
off	20
his	20
shoulders;	20
for	20
‘God	20
bears	20
with	20
the	20
wicked,	20
but	20
not	20
for	20
ever.”	20
“Ah!”	20
exclaimed	20
the	20
Distressed	20
One	20
at	20
this,	20
“may	20
all	20
the	20
stars	20
of	20
the	20
celestial	20
regions	20
look	20
down	20
upon	20
your	20
greatness	20
with	20
benign	20
eyes,	20
valiant	20
knight,	20
and	20
shed	20
every	20
prosperity	20
and	20
valour	20
upon	20
your	20
heart,	20
that	20
it	20
may	20
be	20
the	20
shield	20
and	20
safeguard	20
of	20
the	20
abused	20
and	20
downtrodden	20
race	20
of	20
duennas,	20
detested	20
by	20
apothecaries,	20
sneered	20
at	20
by	20
squires,	20
and	20
made	20

of	20
by	20
pages.	20
Ill	20
betide	20
the	20
jade	20
that	20
in	20
the	20
flower	20
of	20
her	20
youth	20
would	20
not	20
sooner	20
become	20
a	20
nun	20
than	20
a	20
duenna!	20
Unfortunate	20
beings	20
that	20
we	20
are,	20
we	20
duennas!	20
Though	20
we	20
may	20
be	20
descended	20
in	20
the	20
direct	20
male	20
line	20
from	20
Hector	20
of	20
Troy	20
himself,	20
our	20
mistresses	20
never	20
fail	20
to	20
address	20
us	20
as	20
‘you’	20
if	20
they	20
think	20
it	20
makes	20
queens	20
of	20
them.	20
O	20
giant	20
Malambruno,	20
though	20
thou	20
art	20
an	20
enchanter,	20
thou	20
art	20
true	20
to	20
thy	20
promises.	20
Send	20
us	20
now	20
the	20
peerless	20
Clavileño,	20
that	20
our	20
misfortune	20
may	20
be	20
brought	20
to	20
an	20
end;	20
for	20
if	20
the	20
hot	20
weather	20
sets	20
in	20
and	20
these	20
beards	20
of	20
ours	20
are	20
still	20
there,	20
alas	20
for	20
our	20
lot!”	20
The	20
Trifaldi	20
said	20
this	20
in	20
such	20
a	20
pathetic	20
way	20
that	20
she	20
drew	20
tears	20
from	20
the	20
eyes	20
of	20
all	20
and	20
even	20
Sancho’s	20
filled	20
up;	20
and	20
he	20
resolved	20
in	20
his	20
heart	20
to	20
accompany	20
his	20
master	20
to	20
the	20
uttermost	20
ends	20
of	20
the	20
earth,	20
if	20
so	20
be	20
the	20
removal	20
of	20
the	20
wool	20
from	20
those	20
venerable	20
countenances	20
depended	20
upon	20
it.	20

Full	20

And	20
now	20
night	20
came,	20
and	20
with	20
it	20
the	20
appointed	20
time	20
for	20
the	20
arrival	20
of	20
the	20
famous	20
horse	20
Clavileño,	20
the	20
non-appearance	20
of	20
which	20
was	20
already	20
beginning	20
to	20
make	20
Don	20
Quixote	20
uneasy,	20
for	20
it	20
struck	20
him	20
that,	20
as	20
Malambruno	20
was	20
so	20
long	20
about	20
sending	20
it,	20
either	20
he	20
himself	20
was	20
not	20
the	20
knight	20
for	20
whom	20
the	20
adventure	20
was	20
reserved,	20
or	20
else	20
Malambruno	20
did	20
not	20
dare	20
to	20
meet	20
him	20
in	20
single	20
combat.	20
But	20
lo!	20
suddenly	20
there	20
came	20
into	20
the	20
garden	20
four	20
wild-men	20
all	20
clad	20
in	20
green	20
ivy	20
bearing	20
on	20
their	20
shoulders	20
a	20
great	20
wooden	20
horse.	20
They	20
placed	20
it	20
on	20
its	20
feet	20
on	20
the	20
ground,	20
and	20
one	20
of	20
the	20
wild-men	20
said,	20
“Let	20
the	20
knight	20
who	20
has	20
heart	20
for	20
it	20
mount	20
this	20
machine.”	20
Here	20
Sancho	20
exclaimed,	20
“I	20
don’t	20
mount,	20
for	20
neither	20
have	20
I	20
the	20
heart	20
nor	20
am	20
I	20
a	20
knight.”	20
“And	20
let	20
the	20
squire,	20
if	20
he	20
has	20
one,”	20
continued	20
the	20
wild-man,	20
“take	20
his	20
seat	20
on	20
the	20
croup,	20
and	20
let	20
him	20
trust	20
the	20
valiant	20
Malambruno;	20
for	20
by	20
no	20
sword	20
save	20
his,	20
nor	20
by	20
the	20
malice	20
of	20
any	20
other,	20
shall	20
he	20
be	20
assailed.	20
It	20
is	20
but	20
to	20
turn	20
this	20
peg	20
the	20
horse	20
has	20
in	20
his	20
neck,	20
and	20
he	20
will	20
bear	20
them	20
through	20
the	20
air	20
to	20
where	20
Malambruno	20
awaits	20
them;	20
but	20
lest	20
the	20
vast	20
elevation	20
of	20
their	20
course	20
should	20
make	20
them	20
giddy,	20
their	20
eyes	20
must	20
be	20
covered	20
until	20
the	20
horse	20
neighs,	20
which	20
will	20
be	20
the	20
sign	20
of	20
their	20
having	20
completed	20
their	20
journey.”	20
With	20
these	20
words,	20
leaving	20
Clavileño	20
behind	20
them,	20
they	20
retired	20
with	20
easy	20
dignity	20
the	20
way	20
they	20
came.	20
As	20
soon	20
as	20
the	20
Distressed	20
One	20
saw	20
the	20
horse,	20
almost	20
in	20
tears	20
she	20
exclaimed	20
to	20
Don	20
Quixote,	20
“Valiant	20
knight,	20
the	20
promise	20
of	20
Malambruno	20
has	20
proved	20
trustworthy;	20
the	20
horse	20
has	20
come,	20
our	20
beards	20
are	20
growing,	20
and	20
by	20
every	20
hair	20
in	20
them	20
all	20
of	20
us	20
implore	20
thee	20
to	20
shave	20
and	20
shear	20
us,	20
as	20
it	20
is	20
only	20
mounting	20
him	20
with	20
thy	20
squire	20
and	20
making	20
a	20
happy	20
beginning	20
with	20
your	20
new	20
journey.”	20
“That	20
I	20
will,	20
Señora	20
Countess	20
Trifaldi,”	20
said	20
Don	20
Quixote,	20
“most	20
gladly	20
and	20
with	20
right	20
goodwill,	20
without	20
stopping	20
to	20
take	20
a	20
cushion	20
or	20
put	20
on	20
my	20
spurs,	20
so	20
as	20
not	20
to	20
lose	20
time,	20
such	20
is	20
my	20
desire	20
to	20
see	20
you	20
and	20
all	20
these	20
duennas	20
shaved	20
clean.”	20
“That	20
I	20
won’t,”	20
said	20
Sancho,	20
“with	20
good-will	20
or	20
bad-will,	20
or	20
any	20
way	20
at	20
all;	20
and	20
if	20
this	20
shaving	20
can’t	20
be	20
done	20
without	20
my	20
mounting	20
on	20
the	20
croup,	20
my	20
master	20
had	20
better	20
look	20
out	20
for	20
another	20
squire	20
to	20
go	20
with	20
him,	20
and	20
these	20
ladies	20
for	20
some	20
other	20
way	20
of	20
making	20
their	20
faces	20
smooth;	20
I’m	20
no	20
witch	20
to	20
have	20
a	20
taste	20
for	20
travelling	20
through	20
the	20
air.	20
What	20
would	20
my	20
islanders	20
say	20
when	20
they	20
heard	20
their	20
governor	20
was	20
going,	20
strolling	20
about	20
on	20
the	20
winds?	20
And	20
another	20
thing,	20
as	20
it	20
is	20
three	20
thousand	20
and	20
odd	20
leagues	20
from	20
this	20
to	20
Kandy,	20
if	20
the	20
horse	20
tires,	20
or	20
the	20
giant	20
takes	20
huff,	20
we’ll	20
be	20
half	20
a	20
dozen	20
years	20
getting	20
back,	20
and	20
there	20
won’t	20
be	20
isle	20
or	20
island	20
in	20
the	20
world	20
that	20
will	20
know	20
me:	20
and	20
so,	20
as	20
it	20
is	20
a	20
common	20
saying	20
‘in	20
delay	20
there’s	20
danger,’	20
and	20
‘when	20
they	20
offer	20
thee	20
a	20
heifer	20
run	20
with	20
a	20
halter,’	20
these	20
ladies’	20
beards	20
must	20
excuse	20
me;	20
‘Saint	20
Peter	20
is	20
very	20
well	20
in	20
Rome;’	20
I	20
mean	20
I	20
am	20
very	20
well	20
in	20
this	20
house	20
where	20
so	20
much	20
is	20
made	20
of	20
me,	20
and	20
I	20
hope	20
for	20
such	20
a	20
good	20
thing	20
from	20
the	20
master	20
as	20
to	20
see	20
myself	20
a	20
governor.”	20
“Friend	20
Sancho,”	20
said	20
the	20
duke	20
at	20
this,	20
“the	20
island	20
that	20
I	20
have	20
promised	20
you	20
is	20
not	20
a	20
moving	20
one,	20
or	20
one	20
that	20
will	20
run	20
away;	20
it	20
has	20
roots	20
so	20
deeply	20
buried	20
in	20
the	20
bowels	20
of	20
the	20
earth	20
that	20
it	20
will	20
be	20
no	20
easy	20
matter	20
to	20
pluck	20
it	20
up	20
or	20
shift	20
it	20
from	20
where	20
it	20
is;	20
you	20
know	20
as	20
well	20
as	20
I	20
do	20
that	20
there	20
is	20
no	20
sort	20
of	20
office	20
of	20
any	20
importance	20
that	20
is	20
not	20
obtained	20
by	20
a	20
bribe	20
of	20
some	20
kind,	20
great	20
or	20
small;	20
well	20
then,	20
that	20
which	20
I	20
look	20
to	20
receive	20
for	20
this	20
government	20
is	20
that	20
you	20
go	20
with	20
your	20
master	20
Don	20
Quixote,	20
and	20
bring	20
this	20
memorable	20
adventure	20
to	20
a	20
conclusion;	20
and	20
whether	20
you	20
return	20
on	20
Clavileño	20
as	20
quickly	20
as	20
his	20
speed	20
seems	20
to	20
promise,	20
or	20
adverse	20
fortune	20
brings	20
you	20
back	20
on	20
foot	20
travelling	20
as	20
a	20
pilgrim	20
from	20
hostel	20
to	20
hostel	20
and	20
from	20
inn	20
to	20
inn,	20
you	20
will	20
always	20
find	20
your	20
island	20
on	20
your	20
return	20
where	20
you	20
left	20
it,	20
and	20
your	20
islanders	20
with	20
the	20
same	20
eagerness	20
they	20
have	20
always	20
had	20
to	20
receive	20
you	20
as	20
their	20
governor,	20
and	20
my	20
good-will	20
will	20
remain	20
the	20
same;	20
doubt	20
not	20
the	20
truth	20
of	20
this,	20
Señor	20
Sancho,	20
for	20
that	20
would	20
be	20
grievously	20
wronging	20
my	20
disposition	20
to	20
serve	20
you.”	20
“Say	20
no	20
more,	20
señor,”	20
said	20
Sancho;	20
“I	20
am	20
a	20
poor	20
squire	20
and	20
not	20
equal	20
to	20
carrying	20
so	20
much	20
courtesy;	20
let	20
my	20
master	20
mount;	20
bandage	20
my	20
eyes	20
and	20
commit	20
me	20
to	20
God’s	20
care,	20
and	20
tell	20
me	20
if	20
I	20
may	20
commend	20
myself	20
to	20
our	20
Lord	20
or	20
call	20
upon	20
the	20
angels	20
to	20
protect	20
me	20
when	20
we	20
go	20
towering	20
up	20
there.”	20
To	20
this	20
the	20
Trifaldi	20
made	20
answer,	20
“Sancho,	20
you	20
may	20
freely	20
commend	20
yourself	20
to	20
God	20
or	20
whom	20
you	20
will;	20
for	20
Malambruno	20
though	20
an	20
enchanter	20
is	20
a	20
Christian,	20
and	20
works	20
his	20
enchantments	20
with	20
great	20
circumspection,	20
taking	20
very	20
good	20
care	20
not	20
to	20
fall	20
out	20
with	20
anyone.”	20
“Well	20
then,”	20
said	20
Sancho,	20
“God	20
and	20
the	20
most	20
holy	20
Trinity	20
of	20
Gaeta	20
give	20
me	20
help!”	20
“Since	20
the	20
memorable	20
adventure	20
of	20
the	20
fulling	20
mills,”	20
said	20
Don	20
Quixote,	20
“I	20
have	20
never	20
seen	20
Sancho	20
in	20
such	20
a	20
fright	20
as	20
now;	20
were	20
I	20
as	20
superstitious	20
as	20
others	20
his	20
abject	20
fear	20
would	20
cause	20
me	20
some	20
little	20
trepidation	20
of	20
spirit.	20
But	20
come	20
here,	20
Sancho,	20
for	20
with	20
the	20
leave	20
of	20
these	20
gentles	20
I	20
would	20
say	20
a	20
word	20
or	20
two	20
to	20
thee	20
in	20
private;”	20
and	20
drawing	20
Sancho	20
aside	20
among	20
the	20
trees	20
of	20
the	20
garden	20
and	20
seizing	20
both	20
his	20
hands	20
he	20
said,	20
“Thou	20
seest,	20
brother	20
Sancho,	20
the	20
long	20
journey	20
we	20
have	20
before	20
us,	20
and	20
God	20
knows	20
when	20
we	20
shall	20
return,	20
or	20
what	20
leisure	20
or	20
opportunities	20
this	20
business	20
will	20
allow	20
us;	20
I	20
wish	20
thee	20
therefore	20
to	20
retire	20
now	20
to	20
thy	20
chamber,	20
as	20
though	20
thou	20
wert	20
going	20
to	20
fetch	20
something	20
required	20
for	20
the	20
road,	20
and	20
in	20
a	20
trice	20
give	20
thyself	20
if	20
it	20
be	20
only	20
five	20
hundred	20
lashes	20
on	20
account	20
of	20
the	20
three	20
thousand	20
three	20
hundred	20
to	20
which	20
thou	20
art	20
bound;	20
it	20
will	20
be	20
all	20
to	20
the	20
good,	20
and	20
to	20
make	20
a	20
beginning	20
with	20
a	20
thing	20
is	20
to	20
have	20
it	20
half	20
finished.”	20
“By	20
God,”	20
said	20
Sancho,	20
“but	20
your	20
worship	20
must	20
be	20
out	20
of	20
your	20
senses!	20
This	20
is	20
like	20
the	20
common	20
saying,	20
‘You	20
see	20
me	20
with	20
child,	20
and	20
you	20
want	20
me	20
a	20
virgin.’	20
Just	20
as	20
I’m	20
about	20
to	20
go	20
sitting	20
on	20
a	20
bare	20
board,	20
your	20
worship	20
would	20
have	20
me	20
score	20
my	20
backside!	20
Indeed,	20
your	20
worship	20
is	20
not	20
reasonable.	20
Let	20
us	20
be	20
off	20
to	20
shave	20
these	20
duennas;	20
and	20
on	20
our	20
return	20
I	20
promise	20
on	20
my	20
word	20
to	20
make	20
such	20
haste	20
to	20
wipe	20
off	20
all	20
that’s	20
due	20
as	20
will	20
satisfy	20
your	20
worship;	20
I	20
can’t	20
say	20
more.”	20
“Well,	20
I	20
will	20
comfort	20
myself	20
with	20
that	20
promise,	20
my	20
good	20
Sancho,”	20
replied	20
Don	20
Quixote,	20
“and	20
I	20
believe	20
thou	20
wilt	20
keep	20
it;	20
for	20
indeed	20
though	20
stupid	20
thou	20
art	20
veracious.”	20
“I’m	20
not	20
voracious,”	20
said	20
Sancho,	20
“only	20
peckish;	20
but	20
even	20
if	20
I	20
was	20
a	20
little,	20
still	20
I’d	20
keep	20
my	20
word.”	20
With	20
this	20
they	20
went	20
back	20
to	20
mount	20
Clavileño,	20
and	20
as	20
they	20
were	20
about	20
to	20
do	20
so	20
Don	20
Quixote	20
said,	20
“Cover	20
thine	20
eyes,	20
Sancho,	20
and	20
mount;	20
for	20
one	20
who	20
sends	20
for	20
us	20
from	20
lands	20
so	20
far	20
distant	20
cannot	20
mean	20
to	20
deceive	20
us	20
for	20
the	20
sake	20
of	20
the	20
paltry	20
glory	20
to	20
be	20
derived	20
from	20
deceiving	20
persons	20
who	20
trust	20
in	20
him;	20
though	20
all	20
should	20
turn	20
out	20
the	20
contrary	20
of	20
what	20
I	20
hope,	20
no	20
malice	20
will	20
be	20
able	20
to	20
dim	20
the	20
glory	20
of	20
having	20
undertaken	20
this	20
exploit.”	20
“Let	20
us	20
be	20
off,	20
señor,”	20
said	20
Sancho,	20
“for	20
I	20
have	20
taken	20
the	20
beards	20
and	20
tears	20
of	20
these	20
ladies	20
deeply	20
to	20
heart,	20
and	20
I	20
shan’t	20
eat	20
a	20
bit	20
to	20
relish	20
it	20
until	20
I	20
have	20
seen	20
them	20
restored	20
to	20
their	20
former	20
smoothness.	20
Mount,	20
your	20
worship,	20
and	20
blindfold	20
yourself,	20
for	20
if	20
I	20
am	20
to	20
go	20
on	20
the	20
croup,	20
it	20
is	20
plain	20
the	20
rider	20
in	20
the	20
saddle	20
must	20
mount	20
first.”	20
“That	20
is	20
true,”	20
said	20
Don	20
Quixote,	20
and,	20
taking	20
a	20
handkerchief	20
out	20
of	20
his	20
pocket,	20
he	20
begged	20
the	20
Distressed	20
One	20
to	20
bandage	20
his	20
eyes	20
very	20
carefully;	20
but	20
after	20
having	20
them	20
bandaged	20
he	20
uncovered	20
them	20
again,	20
saying,	20
“If	20
my	20
memory	20
does	20
not	20
deceive	20
me,	20
I	20
have	20
read	20
in	20
Virgil	20
of	20
the	20
Palladium	20
of	20
Troy,	20
a	20
wooden	20
horse	20
the	20
Greeks	20
offered	20
to	20
the	20
goddess	20
Pallas,	20
which	20
was	20
big	20
with	20
armed	20
knights,	20
who	20
were	20
afterwards	20
the	20
destruction	20
of	20
Troy;	20
so	20
it	20
would	20
be	20
as	20
well	20
to	20
see,	20
first	20
of	20
all,	20
what	20
Clavileño	20
has	20
in	20
his	20
stomach.”	20
“There	20
is	20
no	20
occasion,”	20
said	20
the	20
Distressed	20
One;	20
“I	20
will	20
be	20
bail	20
for	20
him,	20
and	20
I	20
know	20
that	20
Malambruno	20
has	20
nothing	20
tricky	20
or	20
treacherous	20
about	20
him;	20
you	20
may	20
mount	20
without	20
any	20
fear,	20
Señor	20
Don	20
Quixote;	20
on	20
my	20
head	20
be	20
it	20
if	20
any	20
harm	20
befalls	20
you.”	20
Don	20
Quixote	20
thought	20
that	20
to	20
say	20
anything	20
further	20
with	20
regard	20
to	20
his	20
safety	20
would	20
be	20
putting	20
his	20
courage	20
in	20
an	20
unfavourable	20
light;	20
and	20
so,	20
without	20
more	20
words,	20
he	20
mounted	20
Clavileño,	20
and	20
tried	20
the	20
peg,	20
which	20
turned	20
easily;	20
and	20
as	20
he	20
had	20
no	20
stirrups	20
and	20
his	20
legs	20
hung	20
down,	20
he	20
looked	20
like	20
nothing	20
so	20
much	20
as	20
a	20
figure	20
in	20
some	20
Roman	20
triumph	20
painted	20
or	20
embroidered	20
on	20
a	20
Flemish	20
tapestry.	20
Much	20
against	20
the	20
grain,	20
and	20
very	20
slowly,	20
Sancho	20
proceeded	20
to	20
mount,	20
and,	20
after	20
settling	20
himself	20
as	20
well	20
as	20
he	20
could	20
on	20
the	20
croup,	20
found	20
it	20
rather	20
hard,	20
and	20
not	20
at	20
all	20
soft,	20
and	20
asked	20
the	20
duke	20
if	20
it	20
would	20
be	20
possible	20
to	20
oblige	20
him	20
with	20
a	20
pad	20
of	20
some	20
kind,	20
or	20
a	20
cushion;	20
even	20
if	20
it	20
were	20
off	20
the	20
couch	20
of	20
his	20
lady	20
the	20
duchess,	20
or	20
the	20
bed	20
of	20
one	20
of	20
the	20
pages;	20
as	20
the	20
haunches	20
of	20
that	20
horse	20
were	20
more	20
like	20
marble	20
than	20
wood.	20
On	20
this	20
the	20
Trifaldi	20
observed	20
that	20
Clavileño	20
would	20
not	20
bear	20
any	20
kind	20
of	20
harness	20
or	20
trappings,	20
and	20
that	20
his	20
best	20
plan	20
would	20
be	20
to	20
sit	20
sideways	20
like	20
a	20
woman,	20
as	20
in	20
that	20
way	20
he	20
would	20
not	20
feel	20
the	20
hardness	20
so	20
much.	20
Sancho	20
did	20
so,	20
and,	20
bidding	20
them	20
farewell,	20
allowed	20
his	20
eyes	20
to	20
be	20
bandaged,	20
but	20
immediately	20
afterwards	20
uncovered	20
them	20
again,	20
and	20
looking	20
tenderly	20
and	20
tearfully	20
on	20
those	20
in	20
the	20
garden,	20
bade	20
them	20
help	20
him	20
in	20
his	20
present	20
strait	20
with	20
plenty	20
of	20
Paternosters	20
and	20
Ave	20
Marias,	20
that	20
God	20
might	20
provide	20
someone	20
to	20
say	20
as	20
many	20
for	20
them,	20
whenever	20
they	20
found	20
themselves	20
in	20
a	20
similar	20
emergency.	20
At	20
this	20
Don	20
Quixote	20
exclaimed,	20
“Art	20
thou	20
on	20
the	20
gallows,	20
thief,	20
or	20
at	20
thy	20
last	20
moment,	20
to	20
use	20
pitiful	20
entreaties	20
of	20
that	20
sort?	20
Cowardly,	20
spiritless	20
creature,	20
art	20
thou	20
not	20
in	20
the	20
very	20
place	20
the	20
fair	20
Magalona	20
occupied,	20
and	20
from	20
which	20
she	20
descended,	20
not	20
into	20
the	20
grave,	20
but	20
to	20
become	20
Queen	20
of	20
France;	20
unless	20
the	20
histories	20
lie?	20
And	20
I	20
who	20
am	20
here	20
beside	20
thee,	20
may	20
I	20
not	20
put	20
myself	20
on	20
a	20
par	20
with	20
the	20
valiant	20
Pierres,	20
who	20
pressed	20
this	20
very	20
spot	20
that	20
I	20
now	20
press?	20
Cover	20
thine	20
eyes,	20
cover	20
thine	20
eyes,	20
abject	20
animal,	20
and	20
let	20
not	20
thy	20
fear	20
escape	20
thy	20
lips,	20
at	20
least	20
in	20
my	20
presence.”	20
“Blindfold	20
me,”	20
said	20
Sancho;	20
“as	20
you	20
won’t	20
let	20
me	20
commend	20
myself	20
or	20
be	20
commended	20
to	20
God,	20
is	20
it	20
any	20
wonder	20
if	20
I	20
am	20
afraid	20
there	20
is	20
a	20
region	20
of	20
devils	20
about	20
here	20
that	20
will	20
carry	20
us	20
off	20
to	20
Peralvillo?”	20
They	20
were	20
then	20
blindfolded,	20
and	20
Don	20
Quixote,	20
finding	20
himself	20
settled	20
to	20
his	20
satisfaction,	20
felt	20
for	20
the	20
peg,	20
and	20
the	20
instant	20
he	20
placed	20
his	20
fingers	20
on	20
it,	20
all	20
the	20
duennas	20
and	20
all	20
who	20
stood	20
by	20
lifted	20
up	20
their	20
voices	20
exclaiming,	20
“God	20
guide	20
thee,	20
valiant	20
knight!	20
God	20
be	20
with	20
thee,	20
intrepid	20
squire!	20
Now,	20
now	20
ye	20
go	20
cleaving	20
the	20
air	20
more	20
swiftly	20
than	20
an	20
arrow!	20
Now	20
ye	20
begin	20
to	20
amaze	20
and	20
astonish	20
all	20
who	20
are	20
gazing	20
at	20
you	20
from	20
the	20
earth!	20
Take	20
care	20
not	20
to	20
wobble	20
about,	20
valiant	20
Sancho!	20
Mind	20
thou	20
fall	20
not,	20
for	20
thy	20
fall	20
will	20
be	20
worse	20
than	20
that	20
rash	20
youth’s	20
who	20
tried	20
to	20
steer	20
the	20
chariot	20
of	20
his	20
father	20
the	20
Sun!”	20
As	20
Sancho	20
heard	20
the	20
voices,	20
clinging	20
tightly	20
to	20
his	20
master	20
and	20
winding	20
his	20
arms	20
round	20
him,	20
he	20
said,	20
“Señor,	20
how	20
do	20
they	20
make	20
out	20
we	20
are	20
going	20
up	20
so	20
high,	20
if	20
their	20
voices	20
reach	20
us	20
here	20
and	20
they	20
seem	20
to	20
be	20
speaking	20
quite	20
close	20
to	20
us?”	20
“Don’t	20
mind	20
that,	20
Sancho,”	20
said	20
Don	20
Quixote;	20
“for	20
as	20
affairs	20
of	20
this	20
sort,	20
and	20
flights	20
like	20
this	20
are	20
out	20
of	20
the	20
common	20
course	20
of	20
things,	20
you	20
can	20
see	20
and	20
hear	20
as	20
much	20
as	20
you	20
like	20
a	20
thousand	20
leagues	20
off;	20
but	20
don’t	20
squeeze	20
me	20
so	20
tight	20
or	20
thou	20
wilt	20
upset	20
me;	20
and	20
really	20
I	20
know	20
not	20
what	20
thou	20
hast	20
to	20
be	20
uneasy	20
or	20
frightened	20
at,	20
for	20
I	20
can	20
safely	20
swear	20
I	20
never	20
mounted	20
a	20
smoother-going	20
steed	20
all	20
the	20
days	20
of	20
my	20
life;	20
one	20
would	20
fancy	20
we	20
never	20
stirred	20
from	20
one	20
place.	20
Banish	20
fear,	20
my	20
friend,	20
for	20
indeed	20
everything	20
is	20
going	20
as	20
it	20
ought,	20
and	20
we	20
have	20
the	20
wind	20
astern.”	20
“That’s	20
true,”	20
said	20
Sancho,	20
“for	20
such	20
a	20
strong	20
wind	20
comes	20
against	20
me	20
on	20
this	20
side,	20
that	20
it	20
seems	20
as	20
if	20
people	20
were	20
blowing	20
on	20
me	20
with	20
a	20
thousand	20
pair	20
of	20
bellows;”	20
which	20
was	20
the	20
case;	20
they	20
were	20
puffing	20
at	20
him	20
with	20
a	20
great	20
pair	20
of	20
bellows;	20
for	20
the	20
whole	20
adventure	20
was	20
so	20
well	20
planned	20
by	20
the	20
duke,	20
the	20
duchess,	20
and	20
their	20
majordomo,	20
that	20
nothing	20
was	20
omitted	20
to	20
make	20
it	20
perfectly	20
successful.	20
Don	20
Quixote	20
now,	20
feeling	20
the	20
blast,	20
said,	20
“Beyond	20
a	20
doubt,	20
Sancho,	20
we	20
must	20
have	20
already	20
reached	20
the	20
second	20
region	20
of	20
the	20
air,	20
where	20
the	20
hail	20
and	20
snow	20
are	20
generated;	20
the	20
thunder,	20
the	20
lightning,	20
and	20
the	20
thunderbolts	20
are	20
engendered	20
in	20
the	20
third	20
region,	20
and	20
if	20
we	20
go	20
on	20
ascending	20
at	20
this	20
rate,	20
we	20
shall	20
shortly	20
plunge	20
into	20
the	20
region	20
of	20
fire,	20
and	20
I	20
know	20
not	20
how	20
to	20
regulate	20
this	20
peg,	20
so	20
as	20
not	20
to	20
mount	20
up	20
where	20
we	20
shall	20
be	20
burned.”	20
And	20
now	20
they	20
began	20
to	20
warm	20
their	20
faces,	20
from	20
a	20
distance,	20
with	20
tow	20
that	20
could	20
be	20
easily	20
set	20
on	20
fire	20
and	20
extinguished	20
again,	20
fixed	20
on	20
the	20
end	20
of	20
a	20
cane.	20
On	20
feeling	20
the	20
heat	20
Sancho	20
said,	20
“May	20
I	20
die	20
if	20
we	20
are	20
not	20
already	20
in	20
that	20
fire	20
place,	20
or	20
very	20
near	20
it,	20
for	20
a	20
good	20
part	20
of	20
my	20
beard	20
has	20
been	20
singed,	20
and	20
I	20
have	20
a	20
mind,	20
señor,	20
to	20
uncover	20
and	20
see	20
whereabouts	20
we	20
are.”	20
“Do	20
nothing	20
of	20
the	20
kind,”	20
said	20
Don	20
Quixote;	20
“remember	20
the	20
true	20
story	20
of	20
the	20
licentiate	20
Torralva	20
that	20
the	20
devils	20
carried	20
flying	20
through	20
the	20
air	20
riding	20
on	20
a	20
stick	20
with	20
his	20
eyes	20
shut;	20
who	20
in	20
twelve	20
hours	20
reached	20
Rome	20
and	20
dismounted	20
at	20
Torre	20
di	20
Nona,	20
which	20
is	20
a	20
street	20
of	20
the	20
city,	20
and	20
saw	20
the	20
whole	20
sack	20
and	20
storming	20
and	20
the	20
death	20
of	20
Bourbon,	20
and	20
was	20
back	20
in	20
Madrid	20
the	20
next	20
morning,	20
where	20
he	20
gave	20
an	20
account	20
of	20
all	20
he	20
had	20
seen;	20
and	20
he	20
said	20
moreover	20
that	20
as	20
he	20
was	20
going	20
through	20
the	20
air,	20
the	20
devil	20
bade	20
him	20
open	20
his	20
eyes,	20
and	20
he	20
did	20
so,	20
and	20
saw	20
himself	20
so	20
near	20
the	20
body	20
of	20
the	20
moon,	20
so	20
it	20
seemed	20
to	20
him,	20
that	20
he	20
could	20
have	20
laid	20
hold	20
of	20
it	20
with	20
his	20
hand,	20
and	20
that	20
he	20
did	20
not	20
dare	20
to	20
look	20
at	20
the	20
earth	20
lest	20
he	20
should	20
be	20
seized	20
with	20
giddiness.	20
So	20
that,	20
Sancho,	20
it	20
will	20
not	20
do	20
for	20
us	20
to	20
uncover	20
ourselves,	20
for	20
he	20
who	20
has	20
us	20
in	20
charge	20
will	20
be	20
responsible	20
for	20
us;	20
and	20
perhaps	20
we	20
are	20
gaining	20
an	20
altitude	20
and	20
mounting	20
up	20
to	20
enable	20
us	20
to	20
descend	20
at	20
one	20
swoop	20
on	20
the	20
kingdom	20
of	20
Kandy,	20
as	20
the	20
saker	20
or	20
falcon	20
does	20
on	20
the	20
heron,	20
so	20
as	20
to	20
seize	20
it	20
however	20
high	20
it	20
may	20
soar;	20
and	20
though	20
it	20
seems	20
to	20
us	20
not	20
half	20
an	20
hour	20
since	20
we	20
left	20
the	20
garden,	20
believe	20
me	20
we	20
must	20
have	20
travelled	20
a	20
great	20
distance.”	20
“I	20
don’t	20
know	20
how	20
that	20
may	20
be,”	20
said	20
Sancho;	20
“all	20
I	20
know	20
is	20
that	20
if	20
the	20
Señora	20
Magallanes	20
or	20
Magalona	20
was	20
satisfied	20
with	20
this	20
croup,	20
she	20
could	20
not	20
have	20
been	20
very	20
tender	20
of	20
flesh.”	20
The	20
duke,	20
the	20
duchess,	20
and	20
all	20
in	20
the	20
garden	20
were	20
listening	20
to	20
the	20
conversation	20
of	20
the	20
two	20
heroes,	20
and	20
were	20
beyond	20
measure	20
amused	20
by	20
it;	20
and	20
now,	20
desirous	20
of	20
putting	20
a	20
finishing	20
touch	20
to	20
this	20
rare	20
and	20
well-contrived	20
adventure,	20
they	20
applied	20
a	20
light	20
to	20
Clavileño’s	20
tail	20
with	20
some	20
tow,	20
and	20
the	20
horse,	20
being	20
full	20
of	20
squibs	20
and	20
crackers,	20
immediately	20
blew	20
up	20
with	20
a	20
prodigious	20
noise,	20
and	20
brought	20
Don	20
Quixote	20
and	20
Sancho	20
Panza	20
to	20
the	20
ground	20
half	20
singed.	20
By	20
this	20
time	20
the	20
bearded	20
band	20
of	20
duennas,	20
the	20
Trifaldi	20
and	20
all,	20
had	20
vanished	20
from	20
the	20
garden,	20
and	20
those	20
that	20
remained	20
lay	20
stretched	20
on	20
the	20
ground	20
as	20
if	20
in	20
a	20
swoon.	20
Don	20
Quixote	20
and	20
Sancho	20
got	20
up	20
rather	20
shaken,	20
and,	20
looking	20
about	20
them,	20
were	20
filled	20
with	20
amazement	20
at	20
finding	20
themselves	20
in	20
the	20
same	20
garden	20
from	20
which	20
they	20
had	20
started,	20
and	20
seeing	20
such	20
a	20
number	20
of	20
people	20
stretched	20
on	20
the	20
ground;	20
and	20
their	20
astonishment	20
was	20
increased	20
when	20
at	20
one	20
side	20
of	20
the	20
garden	20
they	20
perceived	20
a	20
tall	20
lance	20
planted	20
in	20
the	20
ground,	20
and	20
hanging	20
from	20
it	20
by	20
two	20
cords	20
of	20
green	20
silk	20
a	20
smooth	20
white	20
parchment	20
on	20
which	20
there	20
was	20
the	20
following	20
inscription	20
in	20
large	20
gold	20
letters:	20
“The	20
illustrious	20
knight	20
Don	20
Quixote	20
of	20
La	20
Mancha	20
has,	20
by	20
merely	20
attempting	20
it,	20
finished	20
and	20
concluded	20
the	20
adventure	20
of	20
the	20
Countess	20
Trifaldi,	20
otherwise	20
called	20
the	20
Distressed	20
Duenna;	20
Malambruno	20
is	20
now	20
satisfied	20
on	20
every	20
point,	20
the	20
chins	20
of	20
the	20
duennas	20
are	20
now	20
smooth	20
and	20
clean,	20
and	20
King	20
Don	20
Clavijo	20
and	20
Queen	20
Antonomasia	20
in	20
their	20
original	20
form;	20
and	20
when	20
the	20
squirely	20
flagellation	20
shall	20
have	20
been	20
completed,	20
the	20
white	20
dove	20
shall	20
find	20
herself	20
delivered	20
from	20
the	20
pestiferous	20
gerfalcons	20
that	20
persecute	20
her,	20
and	20
in	20
the	20
arms	20
of	20
her	20
beloved	20
mate;	20
for	20
such	20
is	20
the	20
decree	20
of	20
the	20
sage	20
Merlin,	20
arch-enchanter	20
of	20
enchanters.”	20
As	20
soon	20
as	20
Don	20
Quixote	20
had	20
read	20
the	20
inscription	20
on	20
the	20
parchment	20
he	20
perceived	20
clearly	20
that	20
it	20
referred	20
to	20
the	20
disenchantment	20
of	20
Dulcinea,	20
and	20
returning	20
hearty	20
thanks	20
to	20
heaven	20
that	20
he	20
had	20
with	20
so	20
little	20
danger	20
achieved	20
so	20
grand	20
an	20
exploit	20
as	20
to	20
restore	20
to	20
their	20
former	20
complexion	20
the	20
countenances	20
of	20
those	20
venerable	20
duennas,	20
he	20
advanced	20
towards	20
the	20
duke	20
and	20
duchess,	20
who	20
had	20
not	20
yet	20
come	20
to	20
themselves,	20
and	20
taking	20
the	20
duke	20
by	20
the	20
hand	20
he	20
said,	20
“Be	20
of	20
good	20
cheer,	20
worthy	20
sir,	20
be	20
of	20
good	20
cheer;	20
it’s	20
nothing	20
at	20
all;	20
the	20
adventure	20
is	20
now	20
over	20
and	20
without	20
any	20
harm	20
done,	20
as	20
the	20
inscription	20
fixed	20
on	20
this	20
post	20
shows	20
plainly.”	20
The	20
duke	20
came	20
to	20
himself	20
slowly	20
and	20
like	20
one	20
recovering	20
consciousness	20
after	20
a	20
heavy	20
sleep,	20
and	20
the	20
duchess	20
and	20
all	20
who	20
had	20
fallen	20
prostrate	20
about	20
the	20
garden	20
did	20
the	20
same,	20
with	20
such	20
demonstrations	20
of	20
wonder	20
and	20
amazement	20
that	20
they	20
would	20
have	20
almost	20
persuaded	20
one	20
that	20
what	20
they	20
pretended	20
so	20
adroitly	20
in	20
jest	20
had	20
happened	20
to	20
them	20
in	20
reality.	20
The	20
duke	20
read	20
the	20
placard	20
with	20
half-shut	20
eyes,	20
and	20
then	20
ran	20
to	20
embrace	20
Don	20
Quixote	20
with	20
open	20
arms,	20
declaring	20
him	20
to	20
be	20
the	20
best	20
knight	20
that	20
had	20
ever	20
been	20
seen	20
in	20
any	20
age.	20
Sancho	20
kept	20
looking	20
about	20
for	20
the	20
Distressed	20
One,	20
to	20
see	20
what	20
her	20
face	20
was	20
like	20
without	20
the	20
beard,	20
and	20
if	20
she	20
was	20
as	20
fair	20
as	20
her	20
elegant	20
person	20
promised;	20
but	20
they	20
told	20
him	20
that,	20
the	20
instant	20
Clavileño	20
descended	20
flaming	20
through	20
the	20
air	20
and	20
came	20
to	20
the	20
ground,	20
the	20
whole	20
band	20
of	20
duennas	20
with	20
the	20
Trifaldi	20
vanished,	20
and	20
that	20
they	20
were	20
already	20
shaved	20
and	20
without	20
a	20
stump	20
left.	20
The	20
duchess	20
asked	20
Sancho	20
how	20
he	20
had	20
fared	20
on	20
that	20
long	20
journey,	20
to	20
which	20
Sancho	20
replied,	20
“I	20
felt,	20
señora,	20
that	20
we	20
were	20
flying	20
through	20
the	20
region	20
of	20
fire,	20
as	20
my	20
master	20
told	20
me,	20
and	20
I	20
wanted	20
to	20
uncover	20
my	20
eyes	20
for	20
a	20
bit;	20
but	20
my	20
master,	20
when	20
I	20
asked	20
leave	20
to	20
uncover	20
myself,	20
would	20
not	20
let	20
me;	20
but	20
as	20
I	20
have	20
a	20
little	20
bit	20
of	20
curiosity	20
about	20
me,	20
and	20
a	20
desire	20
to	20
know	20
what	20
is	20
forbidden	20
and	20
kept	20
from	20
me,	20
quietly	20
and	20
without	20
anyone	20
seeing	20
me	20
I	20
drew	20
aside	20
the	20
handkerchief	20
covering	20
my	20
eyes	20
ever	20
so	20
little,	20
close	20
to	20
my	20
nose,	20
and	20
from	20
underneath	20
looked	20
towards	20
the	20
earth,	20
and	20
it	20
seemed	20
to	20
me	20
that	20
it	20
was	20
altogether	20
no	20
bigger	20
than	20
a	20
grain	20
of	20
mustard	20
seed,	20
and	20
that	20
the	20
men	20
walking	20
on	20
it	20
were	20
little	20
bigger	20
than	20
hazel	20
nuts;	20
so	20
you	20
may	20
see	20
how	20
high	20
we	20
must	20
have	20
got	20
to	20
then.”	20
To	20
this	20
the	20
duchess	20
said,	20
“Sancho,	20
my	20
friend,	20
mind	20
what	20
you	20
are	20
saying;	20
it	20
seems	20
you	20
could	20
not	20
have	20
seen	20
the	20
earth,	20
but	20
only	20
the	20
men	20
walking	20
on	20
it;	20
for	20
if	20
the	20
earth	20
looked	20
to	20
you	20
like	20
a	20
grain	20
of	20
mustard	20
seed,	20
and	20
each	20
man	20
like	20
a	20
hazel	20
nut,	20
one	20
man	20
alone	20
would	20
have	20
covered	20
the	20
whole	20
earth.”	20
“That	20
is	20
true,”	20
said	20
Sancho,	20
“but	20
for	20
all	20
that	20
I	20
got	20
a	20
glimpse	20
of	20
a	20
bit	20
of	20
one	20
side	20
of	20
it,	20
and	20
saw	20
it	20
all.”	20
“Take	20
care,	20
Sancho,”	20
said	20
the	20
duchess,	20
“with	20
a	20
bit	20
of	20
one	20
side	20
one	20
does	20
not	20
see	20
the	20
whole	20
of	20
what	20
one	20
looks	20
at.”	20
“I	20
don’t	20
understand	20
that	20
way	20
of	20
looking	20
at	20
things,”	20
said	20
Sancho;	20
“I	20
only	20
know	20
that	20
your	20
ladyship	20
will	20
do	20
well	20
to	20
bear	20
in	20
mind	20
that	20
as	20
we	20
were	20
flying	20
by	20
enchantment	20
so	20
I	20
might	20
have	20
seen	20
the	20
whole	20
earth	20
and	20
all	20
the	20
men	20
by	20
enchantment	20
whatever	20
way	20
I	20
looked;	20
and	20
if	20
you	20
won’t	20
believe	20
this,	20
no	20
more	20
will	20
you	20
believe	20
that,	20
uncovering	20
myself	20
nearly	20
to	20
the	20
eyebrows,	20
I	20
saw	20
myself	20
so	20
close	20
to	20
the	20
sky	20
that	20
there	20
was	20
not	20
a	20
palm	20
and	20
a	20
half	20
between	20
me	20
and	20
it;	20
and	20
by	20
everything	20
that	20
I	20
can	20
swear	20
by,	20
señora,	20
it	20
is	20
mighty	20
great!	20
And	20
it	20
so	20
happened	20
we	20
came	20
by	20
where	20
the	20
seven	20
goats	20
are,	20
and	20
by	20
God	20
and	20
upon	20
my	20
soul,	20
as	20
in	20
my	20
youth	20
I	20
was	20
a	20
goatherd	20
in	20
my	20
own	20
country,	20
as	20
soon	20
as	20
I	20
saw	20
them	20
I	20
felt	20
a	20
longing	20
to	20
be	20
among	20
them	20
for	20
a	20
little,	20
and	20
if	20
I	20
had	20
not	20
given	20
way	20
to	20
it	20
I	20
think	20
I’d	20
have	20
burst.	20
So	20
I	20
come	20
and	20
take,	20
and	20
what	20
do	20
I	20
do?	20
without	20
saying	20
anything	20
to	20
anybody,	20
not	20
even	20
to	20
my	20
master,	20
softly	20
and	20
quietly	20
I	20
got	20
down	20
from	20
Clavileño	20
and	20
amused	20
myself	20
with	20
the	20
goats—which	20
are	20
like	20
violets,	20
like	20
flowers—for	20
nigh	20
three-quarters	20
of	20
an	20
hour;	20
and	20
Clavileño	20
never	20
stirred	20
or	20
moved	20
from	20
one	20
spot.”	20
“And	20
while	20
the	20
good	20
Sancho	20
was	20
amusing	20
himself	20
with	20
the	20
goats,”	20
said	20
the	20
duke,	20
“how	20
did	20
Señor	20
Don	20
Quixote	20
amuse	20
himself?”	20
To	20
which	20
Don	20
Quixote	20
replied,	20
“As	20
all	20
these	20
things	20
and	20
such	20
like	20
occurrences	20
are	20
out	20
of	20
the	20
ordinary	20
course	20
of	20
nature,	20
it	20
is	20
no	20
wonder	20
that	20
Sancho	20
says	20
what	20
he	20
does;	20
for	20
my	20
own	20
part	20
I	20
can	20
only	20
say	20
that	20
I	20
did	20
not	20
uncover	20
my	20
eyes	20
either	20
above	20
or	20
below,	20
nor	20
did	20
I	20
see	20
sky	20
or	20
earth	20
or	20
sea	20
or	20
shore.	20
It	20
is	20
true	20
I	20
felt	20
that	20
I	20
was	20
passing	20
through	20
the	20
region	20
of	20
the	20
air,	20
and	20
even	20
that	20
I	20
touched	20
that	20
of	20
fire;	20
but	20
that	20
we	20
passed	20
farther	20
I	20
cannot	20
believe;	20
for	20
the	20
region	20
of	20
fire	20
being	20
between	20
the	20
heaven	20
of	20
the	20
moon	20
and	20
the	20
last	20
region	20
of	20
the	20
air,	20
we	20
could	20
not	20
have	20
reached	20
that	20
heaven	20
where	20
the	20
seven	20
goats	20
Sancho	20
speaks	20
of	20
are	20
without	20
being	20
burned;	20
and	20
as	20
we	20
were	20
not	20
burned,	20
either	20
Sancho	20
is	20
lying	20
or	20
Sancho	20
is	20
dreaming.”	20
“I	20
am	20
neither	20
lying	20
nor	20
dreaming,”	20
said	20
Sancho;	20
“only	20
ask	20
me	20
the	20
tokens	20
of	20
those	20
same	20
goats,	20
and	20
you’ll	20
see	20
by	20
that	20
whether	20
I’m	20
telling	20
the	20
truth	20
or	20
not.”	20
“Tell	20
us	20
them	20
then,	20
Sancho,”	20
said	20
the	20
duchess.	20
“Two	20
of	20
them,”	20
said	20
Sancho,	20
“are	20
green,	20
two	20
blood-red,	20
two	20
blue,	20
and	20
one	20
a	20
mixture	20
of	20
all	20
colours.”	20
“An	20
odd	20
sort	20
of	20
goat,	20
that,”	20
said	20
the	20
duke;	20
“in	20
this	20
earthly	20
region	20
of	20
ours	20
we	20
have	20
no	20
such	20
colours;	20
I	20
mean	20
goats	20
of	20
such	20
colours.”	20
“That’s	20
very	20
plain,”	20
said	20
Sancho;	20
“of	20
course	20
there	20
must	20
be	20
a	20
difference	20
between	20
the	20
goats	20
of	20
heaven	20
and	20
the	20
goats	20
of	20
the	20
earth.”	20
“Tell	20
me,	20
Sancho,”	20
said	20
the	20
duke,	20
“did	20
you	20
see	20
any	20
he-goat	20
among	20
those	20
goats?”	20
“No,	20
señor,”	20
said	20
Sancho;	20
“but	20
I	20
have	20
heard	20
say	20
that	20
none	20
ever	20
passed	20
the	20
horns	20
of	20
the	20
moon.”	20
They	20
did	20
not	20
care	20
to	20
ask	20
him	20
anything	20
more	20
about	20
his	20
journey,	20
for	20
they	20
saw	20
he	20
was	20
in	20
the	20
vein	20
to	20
go	20
rambling	20
all	20
over	20
the	20
heavens	20
giving	20
an	20
account	20
of	20
everything	20
that	20
went	20
on	20
there,	20
without	20
having	20
ever	20
stirred	20
from	20
the	20
garden.	20
Such,	20
in	20
short,	20
was	20
the	20
end	20
of	20
the	20
adventure	20
of	20
the	20
Distressed	20
Duenna,	20
which	20
gave	20
the	20
duke	20
and	20
duchess	20
laughing	20
matter	20
not	20
only	20
for	20
the	20
time	20
being,	20
but	20
for	20
all	20
their	20
lives,	20
and	20
Sancho	20
something	20
to	20
talk	20
about	20
for	20
ages,	20
if	20
he	20
lived	20
so	20
long;	20
but	20
Don	20
Quixote,	20
coming	20
close	20
to	20
his	20
ear,	20
said	20
to	20
him,	20
“Sancho,	20
as	20
you	20
would	20
have	20
us	20
believe	20
what	20
you	20
saw	20
in	20
heaven,	20
I	20
require	20
you	20
to	20
believe	20
me	20
as	20
to	20
what	20
I	20
saw	20
in	20
the	20
cave	20
of	20
Montesinos;	20
I	20
say	20
no	20
more.”	20

The	20
duke	20
and	20
duchess	20
were	20
so	20
well	20
pleased	20
with	20
the	20
successful	20
and	20
droll	20
result	20
of	20
the	20
adventure	20
of	20
the	20
Distressed	20
One,	20
that	20
they	20
resolved	20
to	20
carry	20
on	20
the	20
joke,	20
seeing	20
what	20
a	20
fit	20
subject	20
they	20
had	20
to	20
deal	20
with	20
for	20
making	20
it	20
all	20
pass	20
for	20
reality.	20
So	20
having	20
laid	20
their	20
plans	20
and	20
given	20
instructions	20
to	20
their	20
servants	20
and	20
vassals	20
how	20
to	20
behave	20
to	20
Sancho	20
in	20
his	20
government	20
of	20
the	20
promised	20
island,	20
the	20
next	20
day,	20
that	20
following	20
Clavileño’s	20
flight,	20
the	20
duke	20
told	20
Sancho	20
to	20
prepare	20
and	20
get	20
ready	20
to	20
go	20
and	20
be	20
governor,	20
for	20
his	20
islanders	20
were	20
already	20
looking	20
out	20
for	20
him	20
as	20
for	20
the	20
showers	20
of	20
May.	20
Sancho	20
made	20
him	20
an	20
obeisance,	20
and	20
said,	20
“Ever	20
since	20
I	20
came	20
down	20
from	20
heaven,	20
and	20
from	20
the	20
top	20
of	20
it	20
beheld	20
the	20
earth,	20
and	20
saw	20
how	20
little	20
it	20
is,	20
the	20
great	20
desire	20
I	20
had	20
to	20
be	20
a	20
governor	20
has	20
been	20
partly	20
cooled	20
in	20
me;	20
for	20
what	20
is	20
there	20
grand	20
in	20
being	20
ruler	20
on	20
a	20
grain	20
of	20
mustard	20
seed,	20
or	20
what	20
dignity	20
or	20
authority	20
in	20
governing	20
half	20
a	20
dozen	20
men	20
about	20
as	20
big	20
as	20
hazel	20
nuts;	20
for,	20
so	20
far	20
as	20
I	20
could	20
see,	20
there	20
were	20
no	20
more	20
on	20
the	20
whole	20
earth?	20
If	20
your	20
lordship	20
would	20
be	20
so	20
good	20
as	20
to	20
give	20
me	20
ever	20
so	20
small	20
a	20
bit	20
of	20
heaven,	20
were	20
it	20
no	20
more	20
than	20
half	20
a	20
league,	20
I’d	20
rather	20
have	20
it	20
than	20
the	20
best	20
island	20
in	20
the	20
world.”	20
“Recollect,	20
Sancho,”	20
said	20
the	20
duke,	20
“I	20
cannot	20
give	20
a	20
bit	20
of	20
heaven,	20
no	20
not	20
so	20
much	20
as	20
the	20
breadth	20
of	20
my	20
nail,	20
to	20
anyone;	20
rewards	20
and	20
favours	20
of	20
that	20
sort	20
are	20
reserved	20
for	20
God	20
alone.	20
What	20
I	20
can	20
give	20
I	20
give	20
you,	20
and	20
that	20
is	20
a	20
real,	20
genuine	20
island,	20
compact,	20
well	20
proportioned,	20
and	20
uncommonly	20
fertile	20
and	20
fruitful,	20
where,	20
if	20
you	20
know	20
how	20
to	20
use	20
your	20
opportunities,	20
you	20
may,	20
with	20
the	20
help	20
of	20
the	20
world’s	20
riches,	20
gain	20
those	20
of	20
heaven.”	20
“Well	20
then,”	20
said	20
Sancho,	20
“let	20
the	20
island	20
come;	20
and	20
I’ll	20
try	20
and	20
be	20
such	20
a	20
governor,	20
that	20
in	20
spite	20
of	20
scoundrels	20
I’ll	20
go	20
to	20
heaven;	20
and	20
it’s	20
not	20
from	20
any	20
craving	20
to	20
quit	20
my	20
own	20
humble	20
condition	20
or	20
better	20
myself,	20
but	20
from	20
the	20
desire	20
I	20
have	20
to	20
try	20
what	20
it	20
tastes	20
like	20
to	20
be	20
a	20
governor.”	20
“If	20
you	20
once	20
make	20
trial	20
of	20
it,	20
Sancho,”	20
said	20
the	20
duke,	20
“you’ll	20
eat	20
your	20
fingers	20
off	20
after	20
the	20
government,	20
so	20
sweet	20
a	20
thing	20
is	20
it	20
to	20
command	20
and	20
be	20
obeyed.	20
Depend	20
upon	20
it	20
when	20
your	20
master	20
comes	20
to	20
be	20
emperor	20
(as	20
he	20
will	20
beyond	20
a	20
doubt	20
from	20
the	20
course	20
his	20
affairs	20
are	20
taking),	20
it	20
will	20
be	20
no	20
easy	20
matter	20
to	20
wrest	20
the	20
dignity	20
from	20
him,	20
and	20
he	20
will	20
be	20
sore	20
and	20
sorry	20
at	20
heart	20
to	20
have	20
been	20
so	20
long	20
without	20
becoming	20
one.”	20
“Señor,”	20
said	20
Sancho,	20
“it	20
is	20
my	20
belief	20
it’s	20
a	20
good	20
thing	20
to	20
be	20
in	20
command,	20
if	20
it’s	20
only	20
over	20
a	20
drove	20
of	20
cattle.”	20
“May	20
I	20
be	20
buried	20
with	20
you,	20
Sancho,”	20
said	20
the	20
duke,	20
“but	20
you	20
know	20
everything;	20
I	20
hope	20
you	20
will	20
make	20
as	20
good	20
a	20
governor	20
as	20
your	20
sagacity	20
promises;	20
and	20
that	20
is	20
all	20
I	20
have	20
to	20
say;	20
and	20
now	20
remember	20
to-morrow	20
is	20
the	20
day	20
you	20
must	20
set	20
out	20
for	20
the	20
government	20
of	20
the	20
island,	20
and	20
this	20
evening	20
they	20
will	20
provide	20
you	20
with	20
the	20
proper	20
attire	20
for	20
you	20
to	20
wear,	20
and	20
all	20
things	20
requisite	20
for	20
your	20
departure.”	20
“Let	20
them	20
dress	20
me	20
as	20
they	20
like,”	20
said	20
Sancho;	20
“however	20
I’m	20
dressed	20
I’ll	20
be	20
Sancho	20
Panza.”	20
“That’s	20
true,”	20
said	20
the	20
duke;	20
“but	20
one’s	20
dress	20
must	20
be	20
suited	20
to	20
the	20
office	20
or	20
rank	20
one	20
holds;	20
for	20
it	20
would	20
not	20
do	20
for	20
a	20
jurist	20
to	20
dress	20
like	20
a	20
soldier,	20
or	20
a	20
soldier	20
like	20
a	20
priest.	20
You,	20
Sancho,	20
shall	20
go	20
partly	20
as	20
a	20
lawyer,	20
partly	20
as	20
a	20
captain,	20
for,	20
in	20
the	20
island	20
I	20
am	20
giving	20
you,	20
arms	20
are	20
needed	20
as	20
much	20
as	20
letters,	20
and	20
letters	20
as	20
much	20
as	20
arms.”	20
“Of	20
letters	20
I	20
know	20
but	20
little,”	20
said	20
Sancho,	20
“for	20
I	20
don’t	20
even	20
know	20
the	20
A	20
B	20
C;	20
but	20
it	20
is	20
enough	20
for	20
me	20
to	20
have	20
the	20
Christus	20
in	20
my	20
memory	20
to	20
be	20
a	20
good	20
governor.	20
As	20
for	20
arms,	20
I’ll	20
handle	20
those	20
they	20
give	20
me	20
till	20
I	20
drop,	20
and	20
then,	20
God	20
be	20
my	20
help!”	20
“With	20
so	20
good	20
a	20
memory,”	20
said	20
the	20
duke,	20
“Sancho	20
cannot	20
go	20
wrong	20
in	20
anything.”	20
Here	20
Don	20
Quixote	20
joined	20
them;	20
and	20
learning	20
what	20
passed,	20
and	20
how	20
soon	20
Sancho	20
was	20
to	20
go	20
to	20
his	20
government,	20
he	20
with	20
the	20
duke’s	20
permission	20
took	20
him	20
by	20
the	20
hand,	20
and	20
retired	20
to	20
his	20
room	20
with	20
him	20
for	20
the	20
purpose	20
of	20
giving	20
him	20
advice	20
as	20
to	20
how	20
he	20
was	20
to	20
demean	20
himself	20
in	20
his	20
office.	20
As	20
soon	20
as	20
they	20
had	20
entered	20
the	20
chamber	20
he	20
closed	20
the	20
door	20
after	20
him,	20
and	20
almost	20
by	20
force	20
made	20
Sancho	20
sit	20
down	20
beside	20
him,	20
and	20
in	20
a	20
quiet	20
tone	20
thus	20
addressed	20
him:	20
“I	20
give	20
infinite	20
thanks	20
to	20
heaven,	20
friend	20
Sancho,	20
that,	20
before	20
I	20
have	20
met	20
with	20
any	20
good	20
luck,	20
fortune	20
has	20
come	20
forward	20
to	20
meet	20
thee.	20
I	20
who	20
counted	20
upon	20
my	20
good	20
fortune	20
to	20
discharge	20
the	20
recompense	20
of	20
thy	20
services,	20
find	20
myself	20
still	20
waiting	20
for	20
advancement,	20
while	20
thou,	20
before	20
the	20
time,	20
and	20
contrary	20
to	20
all	20
reasonable	20
expectation,	20
seest	20
thyself	20
blessed	20
in	20
the	20
fulfillment	20
of	20
thy	20
desires.	20
Some	20
will	20
bribe,	20
beg,	20
solicit,	20
rise	20
early,	20
entreat,	20
persist,	20
without	20
attaining	20
the	20
object	20
of	20
their	20
suit;	20
while	20
another	20
comes,	20
and	20
without	20
knowing	20
why	20
or	20
wherefore,	20
finds	20
himself	20
invested	20
with	20
the	20
place	20
or	20
office	20
so	20
many	20
have	20
sued	20
for;	20
and	20
here	20
it	20
is	20
that	20
the	20
common	20
saying,	20
‘There	20
is	20
good	20
luck	20
as	20
well	20
as	20
bad	20
luck	20
in	20
suits,’	20
applies.	20
Thou,	20
who,	20
to	20
my	20
thinking,	20
art	20
beyond	20
all	20
doubt	20
a	20
dullard,	20
without	20
early	20
rising	20
or	20
night	20
watching	20
or	20
taking	20
any	20
trouble,	20
with	20
the	20
mere	20
breath	20
of	20
knight-errantry	20
that	20
has	20
breathed	20
upon	20
thee,	20
seest	20
thyself	20
without	20
more	20
ado	20
governor	20
of	20
an	20
island,	20
as	20
though	20
it	20
were	20
a	20
mere	20
matter	20
of	20
course.	20
This	20
I	20
say,	20
Sancho,	20
that	20
thou	20
attribute	20
not	20
the	20
favour	20
thou	20
hast	20
received	20
to	20
thine	20
own	20
merits,	20
but	20
give	20
thanks	20
to	20
heaven	20
that	20
disposes	20
matters	20
beneficently,	20
and	20
secondly	20
thanks	20
to	20
the	20
great	20
power	20
the	20
profession	20
of	20
knight-errantry	20
contains	20
in	20
itself.	20
With	20
a	20
heart,	20
then,	20
inclined	20
to	20
believe	20
what	20
I	20
have	20
said	20
to	20
thee,	20
attend,	20
my	20
son,	20
to	20
thy	20
Cato	20
here	20
who	20
would	20
counsel	20
thee	20
and	20
be	20
thy	20
polestar	20
and	20
guide	20
to	20
direct	20
and	20
pilot	20
thee	20
to	20
a	20
safe	20
haven	20
out	20
of	20
this	20
stormy	20
sea	20
wherein	20
thou	20
art	20
about	20
to	20
ingulf	20
thyself;	20
for	20
offices	20
and	20
great	20
trusts	20
are	20
nothing	20
else	20
but	20
a	20
mighty	20
gulf	20
of	20
troubles.	20
“First	20
of	20
all,	20
my	20
son,	20
thou	20
must	20
fear	20
God,	20
for	20
in	20
the	20
fear	20
of	20
him	20
is	20
wisdom,	20
and	20
being	20
wise	20
thou	20
canst	20
not	20
err	20
in	20
aught.	20
“Secondly,	20
thou	20
must	20
keep	20
in	20
view	20
what	20
thou	20
art,	20
striving	20
to	20
know	20
thyself,	20
the	20
most	20
difficult	20
thing	20
to	20
know	20
that	20
the	20
mind	20
can	20
imagine.	20
If	20
thou	20
knowest	20
thyself,	20
it	20
will	20
follow	20
thou	20
wilt	20
not	20
puff	20
thyself	20
up	20
like	20
the	20
frog	20
that	20
strove	20
to	20
make	20
himself	20
as	20
large	20
as	20
the	20
ox;	20
if	20
thou	20
dost,	20
the	20
recollection	20
of	20
having	20
kept	20
pigs	20
in	20
thine	20
own	20
country	20
will	20
serve	20
as	20
the	20
ugly	20
feet	20
for	20
the	20
wheel	20
of	20
thy	20
folly.”	20
“That’s	20
the	20
truth,”	20
said	20
Sancho;	20
“but	20
that	20
was	20
when	20
I	20
was	20
a	20
boy;	20
afterwards	20
when	20
I	20
was	20
something	20
more	20
of	20
a	20
man	20
it	20
was	20
geese	20
I	20
kept,	20
not	20
pigs.	20
But	20
to	20
my	20
thinking	20
that	20
has	20
nothing	20
to	20
do	20
with	20
it;	20
for	20
all	20
who	20
are	20
governors	20
don’t	20
come	20
of	20
a	20
kingly	20
stock.”	20
“True,”	20
said	20
Don	20
Quixote,	20
“and	20
for	20
that	20
reason	20
those	20
who	20
are	20
not	20
of	20
noble	20
origin	20
should	20
take	20
care	20
that	20
the	20
dignity	20
of	20
the	20
office	20
they	20
hold	20
be	20
accompanied	20
by	20
a	20
gentle	20
suavity,	20
which	20
wisely	20
managed	20
will	20
save	20
them	20
from	20
the	20
sneers	20
of	20
malice	20
that	20
no	20
station	20
escapes.	20
“Glory	20
in	20
thy	20
humble	20
birth,	20
Sancho,	20
and	20
be	20
not	20
ashamed	20
of	20
saying	20
thou	20
art	20
peasant-born;	20
for	20
when	20
it	20
is	20
seen	20
thou	20
art	20
not	20
ashamed	20
no	20
one	20
will	20
set	20
himself	20
to	20
put	20
thee	20
to	20
the	20
blush;	20
and	20
pride	20
thyself	20
rather	20
upon	20
being	20
one	20
of	20
lowly	20
virtue	20
than	20
a	20
lofty	20
sinner.	20
Countless	20
are	20
they	20
who,	20
born	20
of	20
mean	20
parentage,	20
have	20
risen	20
to	20
the	20
highest	20
dignities,	20
pontifical	20
and	20
imperial,	20
and	20
of	20
the	20
truth	20
of	20
this	20
I	20
could	20
give	20
thee	20
instances	20
enough	20
to	20
weary	20
thee.	20
“Remember,	20
Sancho,	20
if	20
thou	20
make	20
virtue	20
thy	20
aim,	20
and	20
take	20
a	20
pride	20
in	20
doing	20
virtuous	20
actions,	20
thou	20
wilt	20
have	20
no	20
cause	20
to	20
envy	20
those	20
who	20
have	20
princely	20
and	20
lordly	20
ones,	20
for	20
blood	20
is	20
an	20
inheritance,	20
but	20
virtue	20
an	20
acquisition,	20
and	20
virtue	20
has	20
in	20
itself	20
alone	20
a	20
worth	20
that	20
blood	20
does	20
not	20
possess.	20
“This	20
being	20
so,	20
if	20
perchance	20
anyone	20
of	20
thy	20
kinsfolk	20
should	20
come	20
to	20
see	20
thee	20
when	20
thou	20
art	20
in	20
thine	20
island,	20
thou	20
art	20
not	20
to	20
repel	20
or	20
slight	20
him,	20
but	20
on	20
the	20
contrary	20
to	20
welcome	20
him,	20
entertain	20
him,	20
and	20
make	20
much	20
of	20
him;	20
for	20
in	20
so	20
doing	20
thou	20
wilt	20
be	20
approved	20
of	20
heaven	20
(which	20
is	20
not	20
pleased	20
that	20
any	20
should	20
despise	20
what	20
it	20

“If	20

“Abuse	20
not	20
by	20
word	20
him	20
whom	20
thou	20
hast	20
to	20
punish	20
in	20
deed,	20
for	20
the	20
pain	20
of	20
punishment	20
is	20
enough	20
for	20
the	20
unfortunate	20
without	20
the	20
addition	20
of	20
thine	20
objurgations.	20
“Bear	20
in	20
mind	20
that	20
the	20
culprit	20
who	20
comes	20
under	20
thy	20
jurisdiction	20
is	20
but	20
a	20
miserable	20
man	20
subject	20
to	20
all	20
the	20
propensities	20
of	20
our	20
depraved	20
nature,	20
and	20
so	20
far	20
as	20
may	20
be	20
in	20
thy	20
power	20
show	20
thyself	20
lenient	20
and	20
forbearing;	20
for	20
though	20
the	20
attributes	20
of	20
God	20
are	20
all	20
equal,	20
to	20
our	20
eyes	20
that	20
of	20
mercy	20
is	20
brighter	20
and	20
loftier	20
than	20
that	20
of	20
justice.	20
“If	20
thou	20
followest	20
these	20
precepts	20
and	20
rules,	20
Sancho,	20
thy	20
days	20
will	20
be	20
long,	20
thy	20
fame	20
eternal,	20
thy	20
reward	20
abundant,	20
thy	20
felicity	20
unutterable;	20
thou	20
wilt	20
marry	20
thy	20
children	20
as	20
thou	20
wouldst;	20
they	20
and	20
thy	20
grandchildren	20
will	20
bear	20
titles;	20
thou	20
wilt	20
live	20
in	20
peace	20
and	20
concord	20
with	20
all	20
men;	20
and,	20
when	20
life	20
draws	20
to	20
a	20
close,	20
death	20
will	20
come	20
to	20
thee	20
in	20
calm	20
and	20
ripe	20
old	20
age,	20
and	20
the	20
light	20
and	20
loving	20
hands	20
of	20
thy	20
great-grandchildren	20
will	20
close	20
thine	20
eyes.	20
“What	20
I	20
have	20
thus	20
far	20
addressed	20
to	20
thee	20
are	20
instructions	20
for	20
the	20

of	20
thy	20

now	20
to	20

Who,	20
hearing	20
the	20
foregoing	20
discourse	20
of	20
Don	20
Quixote,	20
would	20
not	20
have	20
set	20
him	20
down	20
for	20
a	20
person	20
of	20
great	20
good	20
sense	20
and	20
greater	20
rectitude	20
of	20
purpose?	20
But,	20
as	20
has	20
been	20
frequently	20
observed	20
in	20
the	20
course	20
of	20
this	20
great	20
history,	20
he	20
only	20
talked	20
nonsense	20
when	20
he	20
touched	20
on	20
chivalry,	20
and	20
in	20
discussing	20
all	20
other	20
subjects	20
showed	20
that	20
he	20
had	20
a	20
clear	20
and	20
unbiassed	20
understanding;	20
so	20
that	20
at	20
every	20
turn	20
his	20
acts	20
gave	20
the	20
lie	20
to	20
his	20
intellect,	20
and	20
his	20
intellect	20
to	20
his	20
acts;	20
but	20
in	20
the	20
case	20
of	20
these	20
second	20
counsels	20
that	20
he	20
gave	20
Sancho,	20
he	20
showed	20
himself	20
to	20
have	20
a	20
lively	20
turn	20
of	20
humour,	20
and	20
displayed	20
conspicuously	20
his	20
wisdom,	20
and	20
also	20
his	20
folly.	20
Sancho	20
listened	20
to	20
him	20
with	20
the	20
deepest	20
attention,	20
and	20
endeavoured	20
to	20
fix	20
his	20
counsels	20
in	20
his	20
memory,	20
like	20
one	20
who	20
meant	20
to	20
follow	20
them	20
and	20
by	20
their	20
means	20
bring	20
the	20
full	20
promise	20
of	20
his	20
government	20
to	20
a	20
happy	20
issue.	20
Don	20
Quixote,	20
then,	20
went	20
on	20
to	20
say:	20
“With	20
regard	20
to	20
the	20
mode	20
in	20
which	20
thou	20
shouldst	20
govern	20
thy	20
person	20
and	20
thy	20
house,	20
Sancho,	20
the	20
first	20
charge	20
I	20
have	20
to	20
give	20
thee	20
is	20
to	20
be	20
clean,	20
and	20
to	20
cut	20
thy	20
nails,	20
not	20
letting	20
them	20
grow	20
as	20
some	20
do,	20
whose	20
ignorance	20
makes	20
them	20
fancy	20
that	20
long	20
nails	20
are	20
an	20
ornament	20
to	20
their	20
hands,	20
as	20
if	20
those	20
excrescences	20
they	20
neglect	20
to	20
cut	20
were	20
nails,	20
and	20
not	20
the	20
talons	20
of	20
a	20
lizard-catching	20
kestrel—a	20
filthy	20
and	20
unnatural	20
abuse.	20
“Go	20
not	20
ungirt	20
and	20
loose,	20
Sancho;	20
for	20
disordered	20
attire	20
is	20
a	20
sign	20
of	20
an	20
unstable	20
mind,	20
unless	20
indeed	20
the	20
slovenliness	20
and	20
slackness	20
is	20
to	20
be	20
set	20
down	20
to	20
craft,	20
as	20
was	20
the	20
common	20
opinion	20
in	20
the	20
case	20
of	20
Julius	20
Cæsar.	20
“Ascertain	20
cautiously	20
what	20
thy	20
office	20
may	20
be	20
worth;	20
and	20
if	20
it	20
will	20
allow	20
thee	20
to	20
give	20
liveries	20
to	20
thy	20
servants,	20
give	20
them	20
respectable	20
and	20
serviceable,	20
rather	20
than	20
showy	20
and	20
gay	20
ones,	20
and	20
divide	20
them	20
between	20
thy	20
servants	20
and	20
the	20
poor;	20
that	20
is	20
to	20
say,	20
if	20
thou	20
canst	20
clothe	20
six	20
pages,	20
clothe	20
three	20
and	20
three	20
poor	20
men,	20
and	20
thus	20
thou	20
wilt	20
have	20
pages	20
for	20
heaven	20
and	20
pages	20
for	20
earth;	20
the	20
vainglorious	20
never	20
think	20
of	20
this	20
new	20
mode	20
of	20
giving	20
liveries.	20
“Eat	20
not	20
garlic	20
nor	20
onions,	20
lest	20
they	20
find	20
out	20
thy	20
boorish	20
origin	20
by	20
the	20
smell;	20
walk	20
slowly	20
and	20
speak	20
deliberately,	20
but	20
not	20
in	20
such	20
a	20
way	20
as	20
to	20
make	20
it	20
seem	20
thou	20
art	20
listening	20
to	20
thyself,	20
for	20
all	20
affectation	20
is	20
bad.	20
“Dine	20
sparingly	20
and	20
sup	20
more	20
sparingly	20
still;	20
for	20
the	20
health	20
of	20
the	20
whole	20
body	20
is	20
forged	20
in	20
the	20
workshop	20
of	20
the	20
stomach.	20
“Be	20
temperate	20
in	20
drinking,	20
bearing	20
in	20
mind	20
that	20
wine	20
in	20
excess	20
keeps	20
neither	20
secrets	20
nor	20
promises.	20
“Take	20
care,	20
Sancho,	20
not	20
to	20
chew	20
on	20
both	20
sides,	20
and	20
not	20
to	20
eruct	20
in	20
anybody’s	20
presence.”	20
“Eruct!”	20
said	20
Sancho;	20
“I	20
don’t	20
know	20
what	20
that	20
means.”	20
“To	20
eruct,	20
Sancho,”	20
said	20
Don	20
Quixote,	20
“means	20
to	20
belch,	20
and	20
that	20
is	20
one	20
of	20
the	20
filthiest	20
words	20
in	20
the	20
Spanish	20
language,	20
though	20
a	20
very	20
expressive	20
one;	20
and	20
therefore	20
nice	20
folk	20
have	20
had	20
recourse	20
to	20
the	20
Latin,	20
and	20
instead	20
of	20
belch	20
say	20
eruct,	20
and	20
instead	20
of	20
belches	20
say	20
eructations;	20
and	20
if	20
some	20
do	20
not	20
understand	20
these	20
terms	20
it	20
matters	20
little,	20
for	20
custom	20
will	20
bring	20
them	20
into	20
use	20
in	20
the	20
course	20
of	20
time,	20
so	20
that	20
they	20
will	20
be	20
readily	20
understood;	20
this	20
is	20
the	20
way	20
a	20
language	20
is	20
enriched;	20
custom	20
and	20
the	20
public	20
are	20
all-powerful	20
there.”	20
“In	20
truth,	20
señor,”	20
said	20
Sancho,	20
“one	20
of	20
the	20
counsels	20
and	20
cautions	20
I	20
mean	20
to	20
bear	20
in	20
mind	20
shall	20
be	20
this,	20
not	20
to	20
belch,	20
for	20
I’m	20
constantly	20
doing	20
it.”	20
“Eruct,	20
Sancho,	20
not	20
belch,”	20
said	20
Don	20
Quixote.	20
“Eruct,	20
I	20
shall	20
say	20
henceforth,	20
and	20
I	20
swear	20
not	20
to	20
forget	20
it,”	20
said	20
Sancho.	20
“Likewise,	20
Sancho,”	20
said	20
Don	20
Quixote,	20
“thou	20
must	20
not	20
mingle	20
such	20
a	20
quantity	20
of	20
proverbs	20
in	20
thy	20
discourse	20
as	20
thou	20
dost;	20
for	20
though	20
proverbs	20
are	20
short	20
maxims,	20
thou	20
dost	20
drag	20
them	20
in	20
so	20
often	20
by	20
the	20
head	20
and	20
shoulders	20
that	20
they	20
savour	20
more	20
of	20
nonsense	20
than	20
of	20
maxims.”	20
“God	20
alone	20
can	20
cure	20
that,”	20
said	20
Sancho;	20
“for	20
I	20
have	20
more	20
proverbs	20
in	20
me	20
than	20
a	20
book,	20
and	20
when	20
I	20
speak	20
they	20
come	20
so	20
thick	20
together	20
into	20
my	20
mouth	20
that	20
they	20
fall	20
to	20
fighting	20
among	20
themselves	20
to	20
get	20
out;	20
that’s	20
why	20
my	20
tongue	20
lets	20
fly	20
the	20
first	20
that	20
come,	20
though	20
they	20
may	20
not	20
be	20
pat	20
to	20
the	20
purpose.	20
But	20
I’ll	20
take	20
care	20
henceforward	20
to	20
use	20
such	20
as	20
befit	20
the	20
dignity	20
of	20
my	20
office;	20
for	20
‘in	20
a	20
house	20
where	20
there’s	20
plenty,	20
supper	20
is	20
soon	20
cooked,’	20
and	20
‘he	20
who	20
binds	20
does	20
not	20
wrangle,’	20
and	20
‘the	20
bell-ringer’s	20
in	20
a	20
safe	20
berth,’	20
and	20
‘giving	20
and	20
keeping	20
require	20
brains.’”	20
“That’s	20
it,	20
Sancho!”	20
said	20
Don	20
Quixote;	20
“pack,	20
tack,	20
string	20
proverbs	20
together;	20
nobody	20
is	20
hindering	20
thee!	20
‘My	20
mother	20
beats	20
me,	20
and	20
I	20
go	20
on	20
with	20
my	20
tricks.’	20
I	20
am	20
bidding	20
thee	20
avoid	20
proverbs,	20
and	20
here	20
in	20
a	20
second	20
thou	20
hast	20
shot	20
out	20
a	20
whole	20
litany	20
of	20
them,	20
which	20
have	20
as	20
much	20
to	20
do	20
with	20
what	20
we	20
are	20
talking	20
about	20
as	20
‘over	20
the	20
hills	20
of	20
Úbeda.’	20
Mind,	20
Sancho,	20
I	20
do	20
not	20
say	20
that	20
a	20
proverb	20
aptly	20
brought	20
in	20
is	20
objectionable;	20
but	20
to	20
pile	20
up	20
and	20
string	20
together	20
proverbs	20
at	20
random	20
makes	20
conversation	20
dull	20
and	20
vulgar.	20
“When	20
thou	20
ridest	20
on	20
horseback,	20
do	20
not	20
go	20
lolling	20
with	20
thy	20
body	20
on	20
the	20
back	20
of	20
the	20
saddle,	20
nor	20
carry	20
thy	20
legs	20
stiff	20
or	20
sticking	20
out	20
from	20
the	20
horse’s	20
belly,	20
nor	20
yet	20
sit	20
so	20
loosely	20
that	20
one	20
would	20
suppose	20
thou	20
wert	20
on	20
Dapple;	20
for	20
the	20
seat	20
on	20
a	20
horse	20
makes	20
gentlemen	20
of	20
some	20
and	20
grooms	20
of	20
others.	20
“Be	20
moderate	20
in	20
thy	20
sleep;	20
for	20
he	20
who	20
does	20
not	20
rise	20
early	20
does	20
not	20
get	20
the	20
benefit	20
of	20
the	20
day;	20
and	20
remember,	20
Sancho,	20
diligence	20
is	20
the	20
mother	20
of	20
good	20
fortune,	20
and	20
indolence,	20
its	20
opposite,	20
never	20
yet	20
attained	20
the	20
object	20
of	20
an	20
honest	20
ambition.	20
“The	20
last	20
counsel	20
I	20
will	20
give	20
thee	20
now,	20
though	20
it	20
does	20
not	20
tend	20
to	20
bodily	20
improvement,	20
I	20
would	20
have	20
thee	20
carry	20
carefully	20
in	20
thy	20
memory,	20
for	20
I	20
believe	20
it	20
will	20
be	20
no	20
less	20
useful	20
to	20
thee	20
than	20
those	20
I	20
have	20
given	20
thee	20
already,	20
and	20
it	20
is	20
this—never	20
engage	20
in	20
a	20
dispute	20
about	20
families,	20
at	20
least	20
in	20
the	20
way	20
of	20
comparing	20
them	20
one	20
with	20
another;	20
for	20
necessarily	20
one	20
of	20
those	20
compared	20
will	20
be	20
better	20
than	20
the	20
other,	20
and	20
thou	20
wilt	20
be	20
hated	20
by	20
the	20
one	20
thou	20
hast	20
disparaged,	20
and	20
get	20
nothing	20
in	20
any	20
shape	20
from	20
the	20
one	20
thou	20
hast	20
exalted.	20
“Thy	20
attire	20
shall	20
be	20
hose	20
of	20
full	20
length,	20
a	20
long	20
jerkin,	20
and	20
a	20
cloak	20
a	20
trifle	20
longer;	20
loose	20
breeches	20
by	20
no	20
means,	20
for	20
they	20
are	20
becoming	20
neither	20
for	20
gentlemen	20
nor	20
for	20
governors.	20
“For	20
the	20
present,	20
Sancho,	20
this	20
is	20
all	20
that	20
has	20
occurred	20
to	20
me	20
to	20
advise	20
thee;	20
as	20
time	20
goes	20
by	20
and	20
occasions	20
arise	20
my	20
instructions	20
shall	20
follow,	20
if	20
thou	20
take	20
care	20
to	20
let	20
me	20
know	20
how	20
thou	20
art	20
circumstanced.”	20
“Señor,”	20
said	20
Sancho,	20
“I	20
see	20
well	20
enough	20
that	20
all	20
these	20
things	20
your	20
worship	20
has	20
said	20
to	20
me	20
are	20
good,	20
holy,	20
and	20
profitable;	20
but	20
what	20
use	20
will	20
they	20
be	20
to	20
me	20
if	20
I	20
don’t	20
remember	20
one	20
of	20
them?	20
To	20
be	20
sure	20
that	20
about	20
not	20
letting	20
my	20
nails	20
grow,	20
and	20
marrying	20
again	20
if	20
I	20
have	20
the	20
chance,	20
will	20
not	20
slip	20
out	20
of	20
my	20
head;	20
but	20
all	20
that	20
other	20
hash,	20
muddle,	20
and	20
jumble—I	20
don’t	20
and	20
can’t	20
recollect	20
any	20
more	20
of	20
it	20
than	20
of	20
last	20
year’s	20
clouds;	20
so	20
it	20
must	20
be	20
given	20
me	20
in	20
writing;	20
for	20
though	20
I	20
can’t	20
either	20
read	20
or	20
write,	20
I’ll	20
give	20
it	20
to	20
my	20
confessor,	20
to	20
drive	20
it	20
into	20
me	20
and	20
remind	20
me	20
of	20
it	20
whenever	20
it	20
is	20
necessary.”	20
“Ah,	20
sinner	20
that	20
I	20
am!”	20
said	20
Don	20
Quixote,	20
“how	20
bad	20
it	20
looks	20
in	20
governors	20
not	20
to	20
know	20
how	20
to	20
read	20
or	20
write;	20
for	20
let	20
me	20
tell	20
thee,	20
Sancho,	20
when	20
a	20
man	20
knows	20
not	20
how	20
to	20
read,	20
or	20
is	20
left-handed,	20
it	20
argues	20
one	20
of	20
two	20
things;	20
either	20
that	20
he	20
was	20
the	20
son	20
of	20
exceedingly	20
mean	20
and	20
lowly	20
parents,	20
or	20
that	20
he	20
himself	20
was	20
so	20
incorrigible	20
and	20
ill-conditioned	20
that	20
neither	20
good	20
company	20
nor	20
good	20
teaching	20
could	20
make	20
any	20
impression	20
on	20
him.	20
It	20
is	20
a	20
great	20
defect	20
that	20
thou	20
labourest	20
under,	20
and	20
therefore	20
I	20
would	20
have	20
thee	20
learn	20
at	20
any	20
rate	20
to	20
sign	20
thy	20
name.”	20
“I	20
can	20
sign	20
my	20
name	20
well	20
enough,”	20
said	20
Sancho,	20
“for	20
when	20
I	20
was	20
steward	20
of	20
the	20
brotherhood	20
in	20
my	20
village	20
I	20
learned	20
to	20
make	20
certain	20
letters,	20
like	20
the	20
marks	20
on	20
bales	20
of	20
goods,	20
which	20
they	20
told	20
me	20
made	20
out	20
my	20
name.	20
Besides	20
I	20
can	20
pretend	20
my	20
right	20
hand	20
is	20
disabled	20
and	20
make	20
someone	20
else	20
sign	20
for	20
me,	20
for	20
‘there’s	20
a	20
remedy	20
for	20
everything	20
except	20
death;’	20
and	20
as	20
I	20
shall	20
be	20
in	20
command	20
and	20
hold	20
the	20
staff,	20
I	20
can	20
do	20
as	20
I	20
like;	20
moreover,	20
‘he	20
who	20
has	20
the	20
alcalde	20
for	20
his	20
father-,’	20
and	20
I’ll	20
be	20
governor,	20
and	20
that’s	20
higher	20
than	20
alcalde.	20
Only	20
come	20
and	20
see!	20
Let	20
them	20
make	20
light	20
of	20
me	20
and	20
abuse	20
me;	20
‘they’ll	20
come	20
for	20
wool	20
and	20
go	20
back	20
shorn;’	20
‘whom	20
God	20
loves,	20
his	20
house	20
is	20
known	20
to	20
Him;’	20
‘the	20
silly	20
sayings	20
of	20
the	20
rich	20
pass	20
for	20
saws	20
in	20
the	20
world;’	20
and	20
as	20
I’ll	20
be	20
rich,	20
being	20
a	20
governor,	20
and	20
at	20
the	20
same	20
time	20
generous,	20
as	20
I	20
mean	20
to	20
be,	20
no	20
fault	20
will	20
be	20
seen	20
in	20
me.	20
‘Only	20
make	20
yourself	20
honey	20
and	20
the	20
flies	20
will	20
suck	20
you;’	20
‘as	20
much	20
as	20
thou	20
hast	20
so	20
much	20
art	20
thou	20
worth,’	20
as	20
my	20
grandmother	20
used	20
to	20
say;	20
and	20
‘thou	20
canst	20
have	20
no	20
revenge	20
of	20
a	20
man	20
of	20
substance.’”	20
“Oh,	20
God’s	20
curse	20
upon	20
thee,	20
Sancho!”	20
here	20
exclaimed	20
Don	20
Quixote;	20
“sixty	20
thousand	20
devils	20
fly	20
away	20
with	20
thee	20
and	20
thy	20
proverbs!	20
For	20
the	20
last	20
hour	20
thou	20
hast	20
been	20
stringing	20
them	20
together	20
and	20
inflicting	20
the	20
pangs	20
of	20
torture	20
on	20
me	20
with	20
every	20
one	20
of	20
them.	20
Those	20
proverbs	20
will	20
bring	20
thee	20
to	20
the	20
gallows	20
one	20
day,	20
I	20
promise	20
thee;	20
thy	20
subjects	20
will	20
take	20
the	20
government	20
from	20
thee,	20
or	20
there	20
will	20
be	20
revolts	20
among	20
them.	20
Tell	20
me,	20
where	20
dost	20
thou	20
pick	20
them	20
up,	20
thou	20
booby?	20
How	20
dost	20
thou	20
apply	20
them,	20
thou	20
blockhead?	20
For	20
with	20
me,	20
to	20
utter	20
one	20
and	20
make	20
it	20
apply	20
properly,	20
I	20
have	20
to	20
sweat	20
and	20
labour	20
as	20
if	20
I	20
were	20
digging.”	20
“By	20
God,	20
master	20
mine,”	20
said	20
Sancho,	20
“your	20
worship	20
is	20
making	20
a	20
fuss	20
about	20
very	20
little.	20
Why	20
the	20
devil	20
should	20
you	20
be	20
vexed	20
if	20
I	20
make	20
use	20
of	20
what	20
is	20
my	20
own?	20
And	20
I	20
have	20
got	20
nothing	20
else,	20
nor	20
any	20
other	20
stock	20
in	20
trade	20
except	20
proverbs	20
and	20
more	20
proverbs;	20
and	20
here	20
are	20
three	20
just	20
this	20
instant	20
come	20
into	20
my	20
head,	20
pat	20
to	20
the	20
purpose	20
and	20
like	20
pears	20
in	20
a	20
basket;	20
but	20
I	20
won’t	20
repeat	20
them,	20
for	20
‘sage	20
silence	20
is	20
called	20
Sancho.’”	20
“That,	20
Sancho,	20
thou	20
art	20
not,”	20
said	20
Don	20
Quixote;	20
“for	20
not	20
only	20
art	20
thou	20
not	20
sage	20
silence,	20
but	20
thou	20
art	20
pestilent	20
prate	20
and	20
perversity;	20
still	20
I	20
would	20
like	20
to	20
know	20
what	20
three	20
proverbs	20
have	20
just	20
now	20
come	20
into	20
thy	20
memory,	20
for	20
I	20
have	20
been	20
turning	20
over	20
mine	20
own—and	20
it	20
is	20
a	20
good	20
one—and	20
none	20
occurs	20
to	20
me.”	20
“What	20
can	20
be	20
better,”	20
said	20
Sancho,	20
“than	20
‘never	20
put	20
thy	20
thumbs	20
between	20
two	20
back	20
teeth;’	20
and	20
‘to	20
“_get	20
out	20
of	20
my	20
house_”	20
and	20
“_what	20
do	20
you	20
want	20
with	20
my	20
wife?_”	20
there	20
is	20
no	20
answer;’	20
and	20
‘whether	20
the	20
pitcher	20
hits	20
the	20
stove,	20
or	20
the	20
stove	20
the	20
pitcher,	20
it’s	20
a	20
bad	20
business	20
for	20
the	20
pitcher;’	20
all	20
which	20
fit	20
to	20
a	20
hair?	20
For	20
no	20
one	20
should	20
quarrel	20
with	20
his	20
governor,	20
or	20
him	20
in	20
authority	20
over	20
him,	20
because	20
he	20
will	20
come	20
off	20
the	20
worst,	20
as	20
he	20
does	20
who	20
puts	20
his	20
finger	20
between	20
two	20
back	20
and	20
if	20
they	20
are	20
not	20
back	20
teeth	20
it	20
makes	20
no	20
difference,	20
so	20
long	20
as	20
they	20
are	20
teeth;	20
and	20
to	20
whatever	20
the	20
governor	20
may	20
say	20
there’s	20
no	20
answer,	20
any	20
more	20
than	20
to	20
‘get	20
out	20
of	20
my	20
house’	20
and	20
‘what	20
do	20
you	20
want	20
with	20
my	20
wife?’	20
and	20
then,	20
as	20
for	20
that	20
about	20
the	20
stone	20
and	20
the	20
pitcher,	20
a	20
blind	20
man	20
could	20
see	20
that.	20
So	20
that	20
he	20
‘who	20
sees	20
the	20
mote	20
in	20
another’s	20
eye	20
had	20
need	20
to	20
see	20
the	20
beam	20
in	20
his	20
own,’	20
that	20
it	20
be	20
not	20
said	20
of	20
himself,	20
‘the	20
dead	20
woman	20
was	20
frightened	20
at	20
the	20
one	20
with	20
her	20
throat	20
cut;’	20
and	20
your	20
worship	20
knows	20
well	20
that	20
‘the	20
fool	20
knows	20
more	20
in	20
his	20
own	20
house	20
than	20
the	20
wise	20
man	20
in	20
another’s.’”	20
“Nay,	20
Sancho,”	20
said	20
Don	20
Quixote,	20
“the	20
fool	20
knows	20
nothing,	20
either	20
in	20
his	20
own	20
house	20
or	20
in	20
anybody	20
else’s,	20
for	20
no	20
wise	20
structure	20
of	20
any	20
sort	20
can	20
stand	20
on	20
a	20
foundation	20
of	20
folly;	20
but	20
let	20
us	20
say	20
no	20
more	20
about	20
it,	20
Sancho,	20
for	20
if	20
thou	20
governest	20
badly,	20
thine	20
will	20
be	20
the	20
fault	20
and	20
mine	20
the	20
shame;	20
but	20
I	20
comfort	20
myself	20
with	20
having	20
done	20
my	20
duty	20
in	20
advising	20
thee	20
as	20
earnestly	20
and	20
as	20
wisely	20
as	20
I	20
could;	20
and	20
thus	20
I	20
am	20
released	20
from	20
my	20
obligations	20
and	20
my	20
promise.	20
God	20
guide	20
thee,	20
Sancho,	20
and	20
govern	20
thee	20
in	20
thy	20
government,	20
and	20
deliver	20
me	20
from	20
the	20
misgiving	20
I	20
have	20
that	20
thou	20
wilt	20
turn	20
the	20
whole	20
island	20
upside	20
down,	20
a	20
thing	20
I	20
might	20
easily	20
prevent	20
by	20
explaining	20
to	20
the	20
duke	20
what	20
thou	20
art	20
and	20
telling	20
him	20
that	20
all	20
that	20
fat	20
little	20
person	20
of	20
thine	20
is	20
nothing	20
else	20
but	20
a	20
sack	20
full	20
of	20
proverbs	20
and	20
sauciness.”	20
“Señor,”	20
said	20
Sancho,	20
“if	20
your	20
worship	20
thinks	20
I’m	20
not	20
fit	20
for	20
this	20
government,	20
I	20
give	20
it	20
up	20
on	20
the	20
spot;	20
for	20
the	20
mere	20
black	20
of	20
the	20
nail	20
of	20
my	20
soul	20
is	20
dearer	20
to	20
me	20
than	20
my	20
whole	20
body;	20
and	20
I	20
can	20
live	20
just	20
as	20
well,	20
simple	20
Sancho,	20
on	20
bread	20
and	20
onions,	20
as	20
governor,	20
on	20
partridges	20
and	20
capons;	20
and	20
what’s	20
more,	20
while	20
we’re	20
asleep	20
we’re	20
all	20
equal,	20
great	20
and	20
small,	20
rich	20
and	20
poor.	20
But	20
if	20
your	20
worship	20
looks	20
into	20
it,	20
you	20
will	20
see	20
it	20
was	20
your	20
worship	20
alone	20
that	20
put	20
me	20
on	20
to	20
this	20
business	20
of	20
governing;	20
for	20
I	20
know	20
no	20
more	20
about	20
the	20
government	20
of	20
islands	20
than	20
a	20
buzzard;	20
and	20
if	20
there’s	20
any	20
reason	20
to	20
think	20
that	20
because	20
of	20
my	20
being	20
a	20
governor	20
the	20
devil	20
will	20
get	20
hold	20
of	20
me,	20
I’d	20
rather	20
go	20
Sancho	20
to	20
heaven	20
than	20
governor	20
to	20
hell.”	20
“By	20
God,	20
Sancho,”	20
said	20
Don	20
Quixote,	20
“for	20
those	20
last	20
words	20
thou	20
hast	20
uttered	20
alone,	20
I	20
consider	20
thou	20
deservest	20
to	20
be	20
governor	20
of	20
a	20
thousand	20
islands.	20
Thou	20
hast	20
good	20
natural	20
instincts,	20
without	20
which	20
no	20
knowledge	20
is	20
worth	20
anything;	20
commend	20
thyself	20
to	20
God,	20
and	20
try	20
not	20
to	20
swerve	20
in	20
the	20
pursuit	20
of	20
thy	20
main	20
object;	20
I	20
mean,	20
always	20
make	20
it	20
thy	20
aim	20
and	20
fixed	20
purpose	20
to	20
do	20
right	20
in	20
all	20
matters	20
that	20
come	20
before	20
thee,	20
for	20
heaven	20
always	20
helps	20
good	20
intentions;	20
and	20
now	20
let	20
us	20
go	20
to	20
dinner,	20
for	20
I	20
think	20
my	20
lord	20
and	20
lady	20
are	20
waiting	20
for	20
us.”	20

It	20
is	20
stated,	20
they	20
say,	20
in	20
the	20
true	20
original	20
of	20
this	20
history,	20
that	20
when	20
Cide	20
Hamete	20
came	20
to	20
write	20
this	20
chapter,	20
his	20
interpreter	20
did	20
not	20
translate	20
it	20
as	20
he	20
wrote	20
it—that	20
is,	20
as	20
a	20
kind	20
of	20
complaint	20
the	20
Moor	20
made	20
against	20
himself	20
for	20
having	20
taken	20
in	20
hand	20
a	20
story	20
so	20
dry	20
and	20
of	20
so	20
little	20
variety	20
as	20
this	20
of	20
Don	20
Quixote,	20
for	20
he	20
found	20
himself	20
forced	20
to	20
speak	20
perpetually	20
of	20
him	20
and	20
Sancho,	20
without	20
venturing	20
to	20
indulge	20
in	20
digressions	20
and	20
episodes	20
more	20
serious	20
and	20
more	20
interesting.	20
He	20
said,	20
too,	20
that	20
to	20
go	20
on,	20
mind,	20
hand,	20
pen	20
always	20
restricted	20
to	20
writing	20
upon	20
one	20
single	20
subject,	20
and	20
speaking	20
through	20
the	20
mouths	20
of	20
a	20
few	20
characters,	20
was	20
intolerable	20
drudgery,	20
the	20
result	20
of	20
which	20
was	20
never	20
equal	20
to	20
the	20
author’s	20
labour,	20
and	20
that	20
to	20
avoid	20
this	20
he	20
had	20
in	20
the	20
First	20
Part	20
availed	20
himself	20
of	20
the	20
device	20
of	20
novels,	20
like	20
“The	20
Ill-advised	20
Curiosity,”	20
and	20
“The	20
Captive	20
Captain,”	20
which	20
stand,	20
as	20
it	20
were,	20
apart	20
from	20
the	20
story;	20
the	20
others	20
are	20
given	20
there	20
being	20
incidents	20
which	20
occurred	20
to	20
Don	20
Quixote	20
himself	20
and	20
could	20
not	20
be	20
omitted.	20
He	20
also	20
thought,	20
he	20
says,	20
that	20
many,	20
engrossed	20
by	20
the	20
interest	20
attaching	20
to	20
the	20
exploits	20
of	20
Don	20
Quixote,	20
would	20
take	20
none	20
in	20
the	20
novels,	20
and	20
pass	20
them	20
over	20
hastily	20
or	20
impatiently	20
without	20
noticing	20
the	20
elegance	20
and	20
art	20
of	20
their	20
composition,	20
which	20
would	20
be	20
very	20
manifest	20
were	20
they	20
published	20
by	20
themselves	20
and	20
not	20
as	20
mere	20
adjuncts	20
to	20
the	20
crazes	20
of	20
Don	20
Quixote	20
or	20
the	20
simplicities	20
of	20
Sancho.	20
Therefore	20
in	20
this	20
Second	20
Part	20
he	20
thought	20
it	20
best	20
not	20
to	20
insert	20
novels,	20
either	20
separate	20
or	20
interwoven,	20
but	20
only	20
episodes,	20
something	20
like	20
them,	20
arising	20
out	20
of	20
the	20
circumstances	20
the	20
facts	20
present;	20
and	20
even	20
these	20
sparingly,	20
and	20
with	20
no	20
more	20
words	20
than	20
suffice	20
to	20
make	20
them	20
plain;	20
and	20
as	20
he	20
confines	20
and	20
restricts	20
himself	20
to	20
the	20
narrow	20
limits	20
of	20
the	20
narrative,	20
though	20
he	20
has	20
ability;	20
capacity,	20
and	20
brains	20
enough	20
to	20
deal	20
with	20
the	20
whole	20
universe,	20
he	20
requests	20
that	20
his	20
labours	20
may	20
not	20
be	20
despised,	20
and	20
that	20
credit	20
be	20
given	20
him,	20
not	20
alone	20
for	20
what	20
he	20
writes,	20
but	20
for	20
what	20
he	20
has	20
refrained	20
from	20
writing.	20
And	20
so	20
he	20
goes	20
on	20
with	20
his	20
story,	20
saying	20
that	20
the	20
day	20
Don	20
Quixote	20
gave	20
the	20
counsels	20
to	20
Sancho,	20
the	20
same	20
afternoon	20
after	20
dinner	20
he	20
handed	20
them	20
to	20
him	20
in	20
writing	20
so	20
that	20
he	20
might	20
get	20
someone	20
to	20
read	20
them	20
to	20
him.	20
They	20
had	20
scarcely,	20
however,	20
been	20
given	20
to	20
him	20
when	20
he	20
let	20
them	20
drop,	20
and	20
they	20
fell	20
into	20
the	20
hands	20
of	20
the	20
duke,	20
who	20
showed	20
them	20
to	20
the	20
duchess	20
and	20
they	20
were	20
both	20
amazed	20
afresh	20
at	20
the	20
madness	20
and	20
wit	20
of	20
Don	20
Quixote.	20
To	20
carry	20
on	20
the	20
joke,	20
then,	20
the	20
same	20
evening	20
they	20
despatched	20
Sancho	20
with	20
a	20
large	20
following	20
to	20
the	20
village	20
that	20
was	20
to	20
serve	20
him	20
for	20
an	20
island.	20
It	20
happened	20
that	20
the	20
person	20
who	20
had	20
him	20
in	20
charge	20
was	20
a	20
majordomo	20
of	20
the	20
duke’s,	20
a	20
man	20
of	20
great	20
discretion	20
and	20
humour—and	20
there	20
can	20
be	20
no	20
humour	20
without	20
discretion—and	20
the	20
same	20
who	20
played	20
the	20
part	20
of	20
the	20
Countess	20
Trifaldi	20
in	20
the	20
comical	20
way	20
that	20
has	20
been	20
already	20
described;	20
and	20
thus	20
qualified,	20
and	20
instructed	20
by	20
his	20
master	20
and	20
mistress	20
as	20
to	20
how	20
to	20
deal	20
with	20
Sancho,	20
he	20
carried	20
out	20
their	20
scheme	20
admirably.	20
Now	20
it	20
came	20
to	20
pass	20
that	20
as	20
soon	20
as	20
Sancho	20
saw	20
this	20
majordomo	20
he	20
seemed	20
in	20
his	20
features	20
to	20
recognise	20
those	20
of	20
the	20
Trifaldi,	20
and	20
turning	20
to	20
his	20
master,	20
he	20
said	20
to	20
him,	20
“Señor,	20
either	20
the	20
devil	20
will	20
carry	20
me	20
off,	20
here	20
on	20
this	20
spot,	20
righteous	20
and	20
believing,	20
or	20
your	20
worship	20
will	20
own	20
to	20
me	20
that	20
the	20
face	20
of	20
this	20
majordomo	20
of	20
the	20
duke’s	20
here	20
is	20
the	20
very	20
face	20
of	20
the	20
Distressed	20
One.”	20
Don	20
Quixote	20
regarded	20
the	20
majordomo	20
attentively,	20
and	20
having	20
done	20
so,	20
said	20
to	20
Sancho,	20
“There	20
is	20
no	20
reason	20
why	20
the	20
devil	20
should	20
carry	20
thee	20
off,	20
Sancho,	20
either	20
righteous	20
or	20
believing—and	20
what	20
thou	20
meanest	20
by	20
that	20
I	20
know	20
not;	20
the	20
face	20
of	20
the	20
Distressed	20
One	20
is	20
that	20
of	20
the	20
majordomo,	20
but	20
for	20
all	20
that	20
the	20
majordomo	20
is	20
not	20
the	20
Distressed	20
One;	20
for	20
his	20
being	20
so	20
would	20
involve	20
a	20
mighty	20
contradiction;	20
but	20
this	20
is	20
not	20
the	20
time	20
for	20
going	20
into	20
questions	20
of	20
the	20
sort,	20
which	20
would	20
be	20
involving	20
ourselves	20
in	20
an	20
inextricable	20
labyrinth.	20
Believe	20
me,	20
my	20
friend,	20
we	20
must	20
pray	20
earnestly	20
to	20
our	20
Lord	20
that	20
he	20
deliver	20
us	20
both	20
from	20
wicked	20
wizards	20
and	20
enchanters.”	20
“It	20
is	20
no	20
joke,	20
señor,”	20
said	20
Sancho,	20
“for	20
before	20
this	20
I	20
heard	20
him	20
speak,	20
and	20
it	20
seemed	20
exactly	20
as	20
if	20
the	20
voice	20
of	20
the	20
Trifaldi	20
was	20
sounding	20
in	20
my	20
ears.	20
Well,	20
I’ll	20
hold	20
my	20
peace;	20
but	20
I’ll	20
take	20
care	20
to	20
be	20
on	20
the	20
look-out	20
henceforth	20
for	20
any	20
sign	20
that	20
may	20
be	20
seen	20
to	20
confirm	20
or	20
do	20
away	20
with	20
this	20
suspicion.”	20
“Thou	20
wilt	20
do	20
well,	20
Sancho,”	20
said	20
Don	20
Quixote,	20
“and	20
thou	20
wilt	20
let	20
me	20
know	20
all	20
thou	20
discoverest,	20
and	20
all	20
that	20
befalls	20
thee	20
in	20
thy	20
government.”	20
Sancho	20
at	20
last	20
set	20
out	20
attended	20
by	20
a	20
great	20
number	20
of	20
people.	20
He	20
was	20
dressed	20
in	20
the	20
garb	20
of	20
a	20
lawyer,	20
with	20
a	20
gaban	20
of	20
tawny	20
watered	20
camlet	20
over	20
all	20
and	20
a	20
montera	20
cap	20
of	20
the	20
same	20
material,	20
and	20
mounted	20
a	20
la	20
gineta	20
upon	20
a	20
mule.	20
Behind	20
him,	20
in	20
accordance	20
with	20
the	20
duke’s	20
orders,	20
followed	20
Dapple	20
with	20
brand	20
new	20
ass-trappings	20
and	20
ornaments	20
of	20
silk,	20
and	20
from	20
time	20
to	20
time	20
Sancho	20
turned	20
round	20
to	20
look	20
at	20
his	20
ass,	20
so	20
well	20
pleased	20
to	20
have	20
him	20
with	20
him	20
that	20
he	20
would	20
not	20
have	20
changed	20
places	20
with	20
the	20
emperor	20
of	20
Germany.	20
On	20
taking	20
leave	20
he	20
kissed	20
the	20
hands	20
of	20
the	20
duke	20
and	20
duchess	20
and	20
got	20
his	20
master’s	20
blessing,	20
which	20
Don	20
Quixote	20
gave	20
him	20
with	20
tears,	20
and	20
he	20
received	20
blubbering.	20

Let	20
worthy	20
Sancho	20
go	20
in	20
peace,	20
and	20
good	20
luck	20
to	20
him,	20
Gentle	20
Reader;	20
and	20
look	20
out	20
for	20
two	20
bushels	20
of	20
laughter,	20
which	20
the	20
account	20
of	20
how	20
he	20
behaved	20
himself	20
in	20
office	20
will	20

thee.	20
In	20
the	20
meantime	20
turn	20
thy	20
attention	20
to	20
what	20
happened	20
his	20
master	20
the	20
same	20
night,	20
and	20
if	20
thou	20
dost	20
not	20
laugh	20
thereat,	20
at	20
any	20
rate	20
thou	20
wilt	20
stretch	20
thy	20
mouth	20
with	20
a	20
grin;	20
for	20
Don	20
Quixote’s	20
adventures	20
must	20
be	20
honoured	20
either	20
with	20
wonder	20
or	20
with	20
laughter.	20
It	20
is	20
recorded,	20
then,	20
that	20
as	20
soon	20
as	20
Sancho	20
had	20
gone,	20
Don	20
Quixote	20
felt	20
his	20
loneliness,	20
and	20
had	20
it	20
been	20
possible	20
for	20
him	20
to	20
revoke	20
the	20
mandate	20
and	20
take	20
away	20
the	20
government	20
from	20
him	20
he	20
would	20
have	20
done	20
so.	20
The	20
duchess	20
observed	20
his	20
dejection	20
and	20
asked	20
him	20
why	20
he	20
was	20
melancholy;	20
because,	20
she	20
said,	20
if	20
it	20
was	20
for	20
the	20
loss	20
of	20
Sancho,	20
there	20
were	20
squires,	20
duennas,	20
and	20
damsels	20
in	20
her	20
house	20
who	20
would	20
wait	20
upon	20
him	20
to	20
his	20
full	20
satisfaction.	20
“The	20
truth	20
is,	20
señora,”	20
replied	20
Don	20
Quixote,	20
“that	20
I	20
do	20
feel	20
the	20
loss	20
of	20
Sancho;	20
but	20
that	20
is	20
not	20
the	20
main	20
cause	20
of	20
my	20
looking	20
sad;	20
and	20
of	20
all	20
the	20
offers	20
your	20
excellence	20
makes	20
me,	20
I	20
accept	20
only	20
the	20
good-will	20
with	20
which	20
they	20
are	20
made,	20
and	20
as	20
to	20
the	20
remainder	20
I	20
entreat	20
of	20
your	20
excellence	20
to	20
permit	20
and	20
allow	20
me	20
alone	20
to	20
wait	20
upon	20
myself	20
in	20
my	20
chamber.”	20
“Indeed,	20
Señor	20
Don	20
Quixote,”	20
said	20
the	20
duchess,	20
“that	20
must	20
not	20
be;	20
four	20
of	20
my	20
damsels,	20
as	20
beautiful	20
as	20
flowers,	20
shall	20
wait	20
upon	20
you.”	20
“To	20
me,”	20
said	20
Don	20
Quixote,	20
“they	20
will	20
not	20
be	20
flowers,	20
but	20
thorns	20
to	20
pierce	20
my	20
heart.	20
They,	20
or	20
anything	20
like	20
them,	20
shall	20
as	20
soon	20
enter	20
my	20
chamber	20
as	20
fly.	20
If	20
your	20
highness	20
wishes	20
to	20
gratify	20
me	20
still	20
further,	20
though	20
I	20
deserve	20
it	20
not,	20
permit	20
me	20
to	20
please	20
myself,	20
and	20
wait	20
upon	20
myself	20
in	20
my	20
own	20
room;	20
for	20
I	20
place	20
a	20
barrier	20
between	20
my	20
inclinations	20
and	20
my	20
virtue,	20
and	20
I	20
do	20
not	20
wish	20
to	20
break	20
this	20
rule	20
through	20
the	20
generosity	20
your	20
highness	20
is	20
disposed	20
to	20
display	20
towards	20
me;	20
and,	20
in	20
short,	20
I	20
will	20
sleep	20
in	20
my	20
clothes,	20
sooner	20
than	20
allow	20
anyone	20
to	20
undress	20
me.”	20
“Say	20
no	20
more,	20
Señor	20
Don	20
Quixote,	20
say	20
no	20
more,”	20
said	20
the	20
duchess;	20
“I	20
assure	20
you	20
I	20
will	20
give	20
orders	20
that	20
not	20
even	20
a	20
fly,	20
not	20
to	20
say	20
a	20
damsel,	20
shall	20
enter	20
your	20
room.	20
I	20
am	20
not	20
the	20
one	20
to	20
undermine	20
the	20
propriety	20
of	20
Señor	20
Don	20
Quixote,	20
for	20
it	20
strikes	20
me	20
that	20
among	20
his	20
many	20
virtues	20
the	20
one	20
that	20
is	20
pre-eminent	20
is	20
that	20
of	20
modesty.	20
Your	20
worship	20
may	20
undress	20
and	20
dress	20
in	20
private	20
and	20
in	20
your	20
own	20
way,	20
as	20
you	20
please	20
and	20
when	20
you	20
please,	20
for	20
there	20
will	20
be	20
no	20
one	20
to	20
hinder	20
you;	20
and	20
in	20
your	20
chamber	20
you	20
will	20
find	20
all	20
the	20
utensils	20
requisite	20
to	20
supply	20
the	20
wants	20
of	20
one	20
who	20
sleeps	20
with	20
his	20
door	20
locked,	20
to	20
the	20
end	20
that	20
no	20
natural	20
needs	20
compel	20
you	20
to	20
open	20
it.	20
May	20
the	20
great	20
Dulcinea	20
del	20
Toboso	20
live	20
a	20
thousand	20
years,	20
and	20
may	20
her	20
fame	20
extend	20
all	20
over	20
the	20
surface	20
of	20
the	20
globe,	20
for	20
she	20
deserves	20
to	20
be	20
loved	20
by	20
a	20
knight	20
so	20
valiant	20
and	20
so	20
virtuous;	20
and	20
may	20
kind	20
heaven	20
infuse	20
zeal	20
into	20
the	20
heart	20
of	20
our	20
governor	20
Sancho	20
Panza	20
to	20
finish	20
off	20
his	20
discipline	20
speedily,	20
so	20
that	20
the	20
world	20
may	20
once	20
more	20
enjoy	20
the	20
beauty	20
of	20
so	20
grand	20
a	20
lady.”	20
To	20
which	20
Don	20
Quixote	20
replied,	20
“Your	20
highness	20
has	20
spoken	20
like	20
what	20
you	20
are;	20
from	20
the	20
mouth	20
of	20
a	20
noble	20
lady	20
nothing	20
bad	20
can	20
come;	20
and	20
Dulcinea	20
will	20
be	20
more	20
fortunate,	20
and	20
better	20
known	20
to	20
the	20
world	20
by	20
the	20
praise	20
of	20
your	20
highness	20
than	20
by	20
all	20
the	20
eulogies	20
the	20
greatest	20
orators	20
on	20
earth	20
could	20
bestow	20
upon	20
her.”	20
“Well,	20
well,	20
Señor	20
Don	20
Quixote,”	20
said	20
the	20
duchess,	20
it	20
is	20
nearly	20
supper-time,	20
and	20
the	20
duke	20
is	20
probably	20
waiting;	20
come	20
let	20
us	20
go	20
to	20
supper,	20
and	20
retire	20
to	20
rest	20
early,	20
for	20
the	20
journey	20
you	20
made	20
yesterday	20
from	20
Kandy	20
was	20
not	20
such	20
a	20
short	20
one	20
but	20
that	20
it	20
must	20
have	20
caused	20
you	20
some	20
fatigue.”	20
“I	20
feel	20
none,	20
señora,”	20
said	20
Don	20
Quixote,	20
“for	20
I	20
would	20
go	20
so	20
far	20
as	20
to	20
swear	20
to	20
your	20
excellence	20
that	20
in	20
all	20
my	20
life	20
I	20
never	20
mounted	20
a	20
quieter	20
beast,	20
or	20
a	20
pleasanter	20
paced	20
one,	20
than	20
Clavileño;	20
and	20
I	20
don’t	20
know	20
what	20
could	20
have	20
induced	20
Malambruno	20
to	20
discard	20
a	20
steed	20
so	20
swift	20
and	20
so	20
gentle,	20
and	20
burn	20
it	20
so	20
recklessly	20
as	20
he	20
did.”	20
“Probably,”	20
said	20
the	20
duchess,	20
“repenting	20
of	20
the	20
evil	20
he	20
had	20
done	20
to	20
the	20
Trifaldi	20
and	20
company,	20
and	20
others,	20
and	20
the	20
crimes	20
he	20
must	20
have	20
committed	20
as	20
a	20
wizard	20
and	20
enchanter,	20
he	20
resolved	20
to	20
make	20
away	20
with	20
all	20
the	20
instruments	20
of	20
his	20
craft;	20
and	20
so	20
burned	20
Clavileño	20
as	20
the	20
chief	20
one,	20
and	20
that	20
which	20
mainly	20
kept	20
him	20
restless,	20
wandering	20
from	20
land	20
to	20
land;	20
and	20
by	20
its	20
ashes	20
and	20
the	20
trophy	20
of	20
the	20
placard	20
the	20
valour	20
of	20
the	20
great	20
Don	20
Quixote	20
of	20
La	20
Mancha	20
is	20
established	20
for	20
ever.”	20
Don	20
Quixote	20
renewed	20
his	20
thanks	20
to	20
the	20
duchess;	20
and	20
having	20
supped,	20
retired	20
to	20
his	20
chamber	20
alone,	20
refusing	20
to	20
allow	20
anyone	20
to	20
enter	20
with	20
him	20
to	20
wait	20
on	20
him,	20
such	20
was	20
his	20
fear	20
of	20
encountering	20
temptations	20
that	20
might	20
lead	20
or	20
drive	20
him	20
to	20
forget	20
his	20
chaste	20
fidelity	20
to	20
his	20
lady	20
Dulcinea;	20
for	20
he	20
had	20
always	20
present	20
to	20
his	20
mind	20
the	20
virtue	20
of	20
Amadis,	20
that	20
flower	20
and	20
mirror	20
of	20
knights-errant.	20
He	20
locked	20
the	20
door	20
behind	20
him,	20
and	20
by	20
the	20
light	20
of	20
two	20
wax	20
candles	20
undressed	20
himself,	20
but	20
as	20
he	20
was	20
taking	20
off	20
his	20
stockings—O	20
disaster	20
unworthy	20
of	20
such	20
a	20
personage!—there	20
came	20
a	20
burst,	20
not	20
of	20
sighs,	20
or	20
anything	20
belying	20
his	20
delicacy	20
or	20
good	20
breeding,	20
but	20
of	20
some	20
two	20
dozen	20
stitches	20
in	20
one	20
of	20
his	20
stockings,	20
that	20
made	20
it	20
look	20
like	20
a	20
window-lattice.	20
The	20
worthy	20
gentleman	20
was	20
beyond	20
measure	20
distressed,	20
and	20
at	20
that	20
moment	20
he	20
would	20
have	20
given	20
an	20
ounce	20
of	20
silver	20
to	20
have	20
had	20
half	20
a	20
drachm	20
of	20
green	20
silk	20
there;	20
I	20
say	20
green	20
silk,	20
because	20
the	20
stockings	20
were	20
green.	20
Here	20
Cide	20
Hamete	20
exclaimed	20
as	20
he	20
was	20
writing,	20
“O	20
poverty,	20
poverty!	20
I	20
know	20
not	20
what	20
could	20
have	20
possessed	20
the	20
great	20
Cordovan	20
poet	20
to	20
call	20
thee	20
‘holy	20
gift	20
ungratefully	20
received.’	20
Although	20
a	20
Moor,	20
I	20
know	20
well	20
enough	20
from	20
the	20
intercourse	20
I	20
have	20
had	20
with	20
Christians	20
that	20
holiness	20
consists	20
in	20
charity,	20
humility,	20
faith,	20
obedience,	20
and	20
poverty;	20
but	20
for	20
all	20
that,	20
I	20
say	20
he	20
must	20
have	20
a	20
great	20
deal	20
of	20
godliness	20
who	20
can	20
find	20
any	20
satisfaction	20
in	20
being	20
poor;	20
unless,	20
indeed,	20
it	20
be	20
the	20
kind	20
of	20
poverty	20
one	20
of	20
their	20
greatest	20
saints	20
refers	20
to,	20
saying,	20
‘possess	20
all	20
things	20
as	20
though	20
ye	20
possessed	20
them	20
not;’	20
which	20
is	20
what	20
they	20
call	20
poverty	20
in	20
spirit.	20
But	20
thou,	20
that	20
other	20
poverty—for	20
it	20
is	20
of	20
thee	20
I	20
am	20
speaking	20
now—why	20
dost	20
thou	20
love	20
to	20
fall	20
out	20
with	20
gentlemen	20
and	20
men	20
of	20
good	20
birth	20
more	20
than	20
with	20
other	20
people?	20
Why	20
dost	20
thou	20
compel	20
them	20
to	20
smear	20
the	20
cracks	20
in	20
their	20
shoes,	20
and	20
to	20
have	20
the	20
buttons	20
of	20
their	20
coats,	20
one	20
silk,	20
another	20
hair,	20
and	20
another	20
glass?	20
Why	20
must	20
their	20
ruffs	20
be	20
always	20
crinkled	20
like	20
endive	20
leaves,	20
and	20
not	20
crimped	20
with	20
a	20
crimping	20
iron?”	20
(From	20
this	20
we	20
may	20
perceive	20
the	20
antiquity	20
of	20
starch	20
and	20
crimped	20
ruffs.)	20
Then	20
he	20
goes	20
on:	20
“Poor	20
gentleman	20
of	20
good	20
family!	20
always	20
cockering	20
up	20
his	20
honour,	20
dining	20
miserably	20
and	20
in	20
secret,	20
and	20
making	20
a	20
hypocrite	20
of	20
the	20
toothpick	20
with	20
which	20
he	20
sallies	20
out	20
into	20
the	20
street	20
after	20
eating	20
nothing	20
to	20
oblige	20
him	20
to	20
use	20
it!	20
Poor	20
fellow,	20
I	20
say,	20
with	20
his	20
nervous	20
honour,	20
fancying	20
they	20
perceive	20
a	20
league	20
off	20
the	20
patch	20
on	20
his	20
shoe,	20
the	20
sweat-stains	20
on	20
his	20
hat,	20
the	20
shabbiness	20
of	20
his	20
cloak,	20
and	20
the	20
hunger	20
of	20
his	20
stomach!”	20
All	20
this	20
was	20
brought	20
home	20
to	20
Don	20
Quixote	20
by	20
the	20
bursting	20
of	20
his	20
stitches;	20
however,	20
he	20
comforted	20
himself	20
on	20
perceiving	20
that	20
Sancho	20
had	20
left	20
behind	20
a	20
pair	20
of	20
travelling	20
boots,	20
which	20
he	20
resolved	20
to	20
wear	20
the	20
next	20
day.	20
At	20
last	20
he	20
went	20
to	20
bed,	20
out	20
of	20
spirits	20
and	20
heavy	20
at	20
heart,	20
as	20
much	20
because	20
he	20
missed	20
Sancho	20
as	20
because	20
of	20
the	20
irreparable	20
disaster	20
to	20
his	20
stockings,	20
the	20
stitches	20
of	20
which	20
he	20
would	20
have	20
even	20
taken	20
up	20
with	20
silk	20
of	20
another	20
colour,	20
which	20
is	20
one	20
of	20
the	20
greatest	20
signs	20
of	20
poverty	20
a	20
gentleman	20
can	20
show	20
in	20
the	20
course	20
of	20
his	20
never-failing	20
embarrassments.	20
He	20
put	20
out	20
the	20
candles;	20
but	20
the	20
night	20
was	20
warm	20
and	20
he	20
could	20
not	20
sleep;	20
he	20
rose	20
from	20
his	20
bed	20
and	20
opened	20
slightly	20
a	20
grated	20
window	20
that	20
looked	20
out	20
on	20
a	20
beautiful	20
garden,	20
and	20
as	20
he	20
did	20
so	20
he	20
perceived	20
and	20
heard	20
people	20
walking	20
and	20
talking	20
in	20
the	20
garden.	20
He	20
set	20
himself	20
to	20
listen	20
attentively,	20
and	20
those	20
below	20
raised	20
their	20
voices	20
so	20
that	20
he	20
could	20
hear	20
these	20
words:	20
“Urge	20
me	20
not	20
to	20
sing,	20
Emerencia,	20
for	20
thou	20
knowest	20
that	20
ever	20
since	20
this	20
stranger	20
entered	20
the	20
castle	20
and	20
my	20
eyes	20
beheld	20
him,	20
I	20
cannot	20
sing	20
but	20
only	20
weep;	20
besides	20
my	20
lady	20
is	20
a	20
light	20
rather	20
than	20
a	20
heavy	20
sleeper,	20
and	20
I	20
would	20
not	20
for	20
all	20
the	20
wealth	20
of	20
the	20
world	20
that	20
she	20
found	20
us	20
here;	20
and	20
even	20
if	20
she	20
were	20
asleep	20
and	20
did	20
not	20
waken,	20
my	20
singing	20
would	20
be	20
in	20
vain,	20
if	20
this	20
strange	20
Æneas,	20
who	20
has	20
come	20
into	20
my	20
neighbourhood	20
to	20
flout	20
me,	20
sleeps	20
on	20
and	20
wakens	20
not	20
to	20
hear	20
it.”	20
“Heed	20
not	20
that,	20
dear	20
Altisidora,”	20
replied	20
a	20
voice;	20
“the	20
duchess	20
is	20
no	20
doubt	20
asleep,	20
and	20
everybody	20
in	20
the	20
house	20
save	20
the	20
lord	20
of	20
thy	20
heart	20
and	20
disturber	20
of	20
thy	20
soul;	20
for	20
just	20
now	20
I	20
perceived	20
him	20
open	20
the	20
grated	20
window	20
of	20
his	20
chamber,	20
so	20
he	20
must	20
be	20
awake;	20
sing,	20
my	20
poor	20
sufferer,	20
in	20
a	20
low	20
sweet	20
tone	20
to	20
the	20
accompaniment	20
of	20
thy	20
harp;	20
and	20
even	20
if	20
the	20
duchess	20
hears	20
us	20
we	20
can	20
lay	20
the	20
blame	20
on	20
the	20
heat	20
of	20
the	20
night.”	20
“That	20
is	20
not	20
the	20
point,	20
Emerencia,”	20
replied	20
Altisidora,	20
“it	20
is	20
that	20
I	20
would	20
not	20
that	20
my	20
singing	20
should	20
lay	20
bare	20
my	20
heart,	20
and	20
that	20
I	20
should	20
be	20
thought	20
a	20
light	20
and	20
wanton	20
maiden	20
by	20
those	20
who	20
know	20
not	20
the	20
mighty	20
power	20
of	20
love;	20
but	20
come	20
what	20
may;	20
better	20
a	20
blush	20
on	20
the	20
cheeks	20
than	20
a	20
sore	20
in	20
the	20
heart;”	20
and	20
here	20
a	20
harp	20
softly	20
touched	20
made	20
itself	20
heard.	20
As	20
he	20
listened	20
to	20
all	20
this	20
Don	20
Quixote	20
was	20
in	20
a	20
state	20
of	20
breathless	20
amazement,	20
for	20
immediately	20
the	20
countless	20
adventures	20
like	20
this,	20
with	20
windows,	20
gratings,	20
gardens,	20
serenades,	20
lovemakings,	20
and	20
languishings,	20
that	20
he	20
had	20
read	20
of	20
in	20
his	20
trashy	20
books	20
of	20
chivalry,	20
came	20
to	20
his	20
mind.	20
He	20
at	20
once	20
concluded	20
that	20
some	20
damsel	20
of	20
the	20
duchess’s	20
was	20
in	20
love	20
with	20
him,	20
and	20
that	20
her	20
modesty	20
forced	20
her	20
to	20
keep	20
her	20
passion	20
secret.	20
He	20
trembled	20
lest	20
he	20
should	20
fall,	20
and	20
made	20
an	20
inward	20
resolution	20
not	20
to	20
yield;	20
and	20
commending	20
himself	20
with	20
all	20
his	20
might	20
and	20
soul	20
to	20
his	20
lady	20
Dulcinea	20
he	20
made	20
up	20
his	20
mind	20
to	20
listen	20
to	20
the	20
music;	20
and	20
to	20
let	20
them	20
know	20
he	20
was	20
there	20
he	20
gave	20
a	20
pretended	20
sneeze,	20
at	20
which	20
the	20
damsels	20
were	20
not	20
a	20
little	20
delighted,	20
for	20
all	20
they	20
wanted	20
was	20
that	20
Don	20
Quixote	20
should	20
hear	20
them.	20
So	20
having	20
tuned	20
the	20
harp,	20
Altisidora,	20
running	20
her	20
hand	20
across	20
the	20
strings,	20
began	20
this	20
ballad:	20
O	20
thou	20
that	20
art	20
above	20
in	20
bed,	20
Between	20
the	20
holland	20
sheets,	20
A-lying	20
there	20
from	20
night	20
till	20
morn,	20
With	20
outstretched	20
legs	20
asleep;	20
O	20
thou,	20
most	20
valiant	20
knight	20
of	20
all	20
The	20
famed	20
Manchegan	20
breed,	20
Of	20
purity	20
and	20
virtue	20
more	20
Than	20
gold	20
of	20
Araby;	20
Give	20
ear	20
unto	20
a	20
suffering	20
maid,	20
Well-grown	20
but	20
evil-starr’d,	20
For	20
those	20
two	20
suns	20
of	20
thine	20
have	20
lit	20
A	20
fire	20
within	20
her	20
heart.	20
Adventures	20
seeking	20
thou	20
dost	20
rove,	20
To	20
others	20
bringing	20
woe;	20
Thou	20
scatterest	20
wounds,	20
but,	20
ah,	20
the	20
balm	20
To	20
heal	20
them	20
dost	20
withhold!	20
Say,	20
valiant	20
youth,	20
and	20
so	20
may	20
God	20
Thy	20
enterprises	20
speed,	20
Didst	20
thou	20
the	20
light	20
mid	20
Libya’s	20
sands	20
Or	20
Jaca’s	20
rocks	20
first	20
see?	20
Did	20
scaly	20
serpents	20
give	20
thee	20
suck?	20
Who	20
nursed	20
thee	20
when	20
a	20
babe?	20
Wert	20
cradled	20
in	20
the	20
forest	20
rude,	20
Or	20
gloomy	20
mountain	20
cave?	20
O	20
Dulcinea	20
may	20
be	20
proud,	20
That	20
plump	20
and	20
lusty	20
maid;	20
For	20
she	20
alone	20
hath	20
had	20
the	20
power	20
A	20
tiger	20
fierce	20
to	20
tame.	20
And	20
she	20
for	20
this	20
shall	20
famous	20
be	20
From	20
Tagus	20
to	20
Jarama,	20
From	20
Manzanares	20
to	20
Genil,	20
From	20
Duero	20
to	20
Arlanza.	20
Fain	20
would	20
I	20
change	20
with	20
her,	20
and	20
give	20
A	20
petticoat	20
to	20
boot,	20
The	20
best	20
and	20
bravest	20
that	20
I	20
have,	20
All	20
trimmed	20
with	20
gold	20
galloon.	20
O	20
for	20
to	20
be	20
the	20
happy	20
fair	20
Thy	20
mighty	20
arms	20
enfold,	20
Or	20
even	20
sit	20
beside	20
thy	20
bed	20
And	20
scratch	20
thy	20
dusty	20
poll!	20
I	20
rave,—to	20
favours	20
such	20
as	20
these	20
Unworthy	20
to	20
aspire;	20
Thy	20
feet	20
to	20
tickle	20
were	20
enough	20
For	20
one	20
so	20
mean	20
as	20
I.	20
What	20
caps,	20
what	20
slippers	20
silver-laced,	20
Would	20
I	20
on	20
thee	20
bestow!	20
What	20
damask	20
breeches	20
make	20
for	20
thee;	20
What	20
fine	20
long	20
holland	20
cloaks!	20
And	20
I	20
would	20
give	20
thee	20
pearls	20
that	20
should	20
As	20
big	20
as	20
oak-galls	20
show;	20
So	20
matchless	20
big	20
that	20
each	20
might	20
well	20
Be	20
called	20
the	20
great	20
“Alone.”	20
Manchegan	20
Nero,	20
look	20
not	20
down	20
From	20
thy	20
Tarpeian	20
Rock	20
Upon	20
this	20
burning	20
heart,	20
nor	20
add	20
The	20
fuel	20
of	20
thy	20
wrath.	20
A	20
virgin	20
soft	20
and	20
young	20
am	20
I,	20
Not	20
yet	20
fifteen	20
years	20
old;	20
(I’m	20
only	20
three	20
months	20
past	20
fourteen,	20
I	20
swear	20
upon	20
my	20
soul).	20
I	20
hobble	20
not	20
nor	20
do	20
I	20
limp,	20
All	20
blemish	20
I’m	20
without,	20
And	20
as	20
I	20
walk	20
my	20
lily	20
locks	20
Are	20
trailing	20
on	20
the	20

And	20

my	20

be	20
rather	20
flat,	20
And	20
though	20
my	20
mouth	20
be	20
wide,	20
My	20
teeth	20
like	20
topazes	20
exalt	20
My	20
beauty	20
to	20
the	20
sky.	20
Thou	20
knowest	20
that	20
my	20
voice	20
is	20
sweet,	20
That	20
is	20
if	20
thou	20
dost	20
hear;	20
And	20
I	20
am	20
moulded	20
in	20
a	20
form	20
Somewhat	20
below	20
the	20
mean.	20
These	20
charms,	20
and	20
many	20
more,	20
are	20
thine,	20
Spoils	20
to	20
thy	20
spear	20
and	20
bow	20
all;	20
A	20
damsel	20
of	20
this	20
house	20

I,	20
By	20
name	20
Altisidora.	20

while	20
the	20

began	20
to	20
feel	20
alarm;	20
and	20
with	20
a	20
deep	20
sigh	20
he	20
said	20
to	20
himself,	20
“O	20
that	20
I	20
should	20
be	20
such	20
an	20
unlucky	20
knight	20
that	20
no	20

O	20
that	20
the	20
peerless	20
Dulcinea	20
should	20
be	20
so	20
unfortunate	20
that	20

in	20

What	20
would	20
ye	20
with	20
her,	20
ye	20
queens?	20
Why	20
do	20
ye	20
persecute	20
her,	20
ye	20
empresses?	20
Why	20
ye	20
pursue	20
her,	20
ye	20
virgins	20
of	20

Leave	20

upon	20

in	20
surrendering	20
my	20
heart	20
and	20
yielding	20
up	20
my	20
soul	20
to	20
her.	20
Ye	20
love-smitten	20
host,	20
know	20
that	20
to	20
Dulcinea	20
only	20
I	20
am	20
dough	20
and	20
sugar-paste,	20
flint	20
to	20
all	20
others;	20
for	20
her	20
I	20
am	20
honey,	20
for	20

For	20
me	20
Dulcinea	20
alone	20
is	20
beautiful,	20
wise,	20
virtuous,	20
graceful,	20
and	20
high-bred,	20
and	20
all	20
others	20
are	20
ill-favoured,	20
foolish,	20
light,	20
and	20
low-born.	20
Nature	20
sent	20
me	20
into	20
the	20
world	20
to	20
be	20
hers	20
and	20
no	20

Altisidora	20

for	20
whose	20
sake	20
they	20
belaboured	20
me	20
in	20
the	20
castle	20
of	20
the	20
enchanted	20
Moor	20
may	20
give	20
way	20
to	20
despair,	20
but	20
I	20
must	20
be	20
Dulcinea’s,	20
boiled	20

pure,	20

chaste,	20
in	20

And	20

To	20

O	20

by	20
whose	20

to	20

I	20
appeal	20
to	20

to	20
proceed	20
with	20
scrupulous	20
exactitude	20
in	20
giving	20
an	20
account	20
of	20
the	20
great	20
Sancho	20
Panza’s	20
government;	20
for	20
without	20
thee	20
I	20
feel	20
myself	20
weak,	20
feeble,	20
and	20
uncertain.	20
To	20
come	20
to	20
the	20
point,	20
then—Sancho	20
with	20
all	20
his	20
attendants	20
arrived	20
at	20
a	20
village	20
of	20
some	20
thousand	20
inhabitants,	20
and	20
one	20
of	20
the	20
largest	20
the	20
duke	20
possessed.	20
They	20
informed	20
him	20
that	20
it	20
was	20
called	20
the	20
island	20
of	20
Barataria,	20
either	20
because	20
the	20
name	20
of	20
the	20
village	20
was	20
Baratario,	20
or	20
because	20
of	20
the	20
joke	20
by	20
way	20
of	20
which	20
the	20
government	20
had	20
been	20
conferred	20
upon	20
him.	20
On	20
reaching	20
the	20
gates	20
of	20
the	20
town,	20
which	20
was	20
a	20
walled	20
one,	20
the	20
municipality	20
came	20
forth	20
to	20
meet	20
him,	20
the	20
bells	20
rang	20
out	20
a	20
peal,	20
and	20
the	20
inhabitants	20
showed	20
every	20
sign	20
of	20
general	20
satisfaction;	20
and	20
with	20
great	20
pomp	20
they	20
conducted	20
him	20
to	20
the	20
principal	20
church	20
to	20
give	20
thanks	20
to	20
God,	20
and	20
then	20
with	20
burlesque	20
ceremonies	20
they	20
presented	20
him	20
with	20
the	20
keys	20
of	20
the	20
town,	20
and	20
acknowledged	20
him	20
as	20
perpetual	20
governor	20
of	20
the	20
island	20
of	20
Barataria.	20
The	20
costume,	20
the	20
beard,	20
and	20
the	20
fat	20
squat	20
figure	20
of	20
the	20
new	20
governor	20
astonished	20
all	20
those	20
who	20
were	20
not	20
in	20
on	20
the	20
secret,	20
and	20
even	20
all	20
who	20
were,	20
and	20
they	20
were	20
not	20
a	20
few.	20
Finally,	20
leading	20
him	20
out	20
of	20
the	20
church	20
they	20
carried	20
him	20
to	20
the	20
judgment	20
seat	20
and	20
seated	20
him	20
on	20
it,	20
and	20
the	20
duke’s	20
majordomo	20
said	20
to	20
him,	20
“It	20
is	20
an	20
ancient	20
custom	20
in	20
this	20
island,	20
señor	20
governor,	20
that	20
he	20
who	20
comes	20
to	20
take	20
possession	20
of	20
this	20
famous	20
island	20
is	20
bound	20
to	20
answer	20
a	20
question	20
which	20
shall	20
be	20
put	20
to	20
him,	20
and	20
which	20
must	20
be	20
a	20
somewhat	20
knotty	20
and	20
difficult	20
one;	20
and	20
by	20
his	20
answer	20
the	20
people	20
take	20
the	20
measure	20
of	20
their	20
new	20
governor’s	20
wit,	20
and	20
hail	20
with	20
joy	20
or	20
deplore	20
his	20
arrival	20
accordingly.”	20
While	20
the	20
majordomo	20
was	20
making	20
this	20
speech	20
Sancho	20
was	20
gazing	20
at	20
several	20
large	20
letters	20
inscribed	20
on	20
the	20
wall	20
opposite	20
his	20
seat,	20
and	20
as	20
he	20
could	20
not	20
read	20
he	20
asked	20
what	20
that	20
was	20
that	20
was	20
painted	20
on	20
the	20
wall.	20
The	20
answer	20
was,	20
“Señor,	20
there	20
is	20
written	20
and	20
recorded	20
the	20
day	20
on	20
which	20
your	20
lordship	20
took	20
possession	20
of	20
this	20
island,	20
and	20
the	20
inscription	20
says,	20
‘This	20
day,	20
the	20
so-and-so	20
of	20
such-and-such	20
a	20
month	20
and	20
year,	20

Don	20
Sancho	20
Panza	20
took	20
possession	20
of	20
this	20
island;	20
many	20
years	20
may	20
he	20
enjoy	20
it.’”	20
“And	20
whom	20
do	20
they	20
call	20
Don	20
Sancho	20
Panza?”	20
asked	20
Sancho.	20
“Your	20
lordship,”	20
replied	20
the	20
majordomo;	20
“for	20
no	20
other	20
Panza	20
but	20
the	20
one	20
who	20
is	20
now	20
seated	20
in	20
that	20
chair	20
has	20
ever	20
entered	20
this	20
island.”	20
“Well	20
then,	20
let	20
me	20
tell	20
you,	20
brother,”	20
said	20
Sancho,	20
“I	20
haven’t	20
got	20
the	20
‘Don,’	20
nor	20
has	20
anyone	20
of	20
my	20
family	20
ever	20
had	20
it;	20
my	20
name	20
is	20
plain	20
Sancho	20
Panza,	20
and	20
Sancho	20
was	20
my	20
father’s	20
name,	20
and	20
Sancho	20
was	20
my	20
grandfather’s	20
and	20
they	20
were	20
all	20
Panzas,	20
without	20
any	20
Dons	20
or	20
Doñas	20
tacked	20
on;	20
I	20
suspect	20
that	20
in	20
this	20
island	20
there	20
are	20
more	20
Dons	20
than	20
stones;	20
but	20
never	20
mind;	20
God	20
knows	20
what	20
I	20
mean,	20
and	20
maybe	20
if	20
my	20
government	20
lasts	20
four	20
days	20
I’ll	20
weed	20
out	20
these	20
Dons	20
that	20
no	20
doubt	20
are	20
as	20
great	20
a	20
nuisance	20
as	20
the	20
midges,	20
they’re	20
so	20
plenty.	20
Let	20
the	20
majordomo	20
go	20
on	20
with	20
his	20
question,	20
and	20
I’ll	20
give	20
the	20
best	20
answer	20
I	20
can,	20
whether	20
the	20
people	20
deplore	20
or	20
not.”	20
At	20
this	20
instant	20
there	20
came	20
into	20
court	20
two	20
old	20
men,	20
one	20
carrying	20
a	20
cane	20
by	20
way	20
of	20
a	20
walking-stick,	20
and	20
the	20
one	20
who	20
had	20
no	20
stick	20
said,	20
“Señor,	20
some	20
time	20
ago	20
I	20
lent	20
this	20
good	20
man	20
ten	20
gold-crowns	20
in	20
gold	20
to	20
gratify	20
him	20
and	20
do	20
him	20
a	20
service,	20
on	20
the	20
condition	20
that	20
he	20
was	20
to	20
return	20
them	20
to	20
me	20
whenever	20
I	20
should	20
ask	20
for	20
them.	20
A	20
long	20
time	20
passed	20
before	20
I	20
asked	20
for	20
them,	20
for	20
I	20
would	20
not	20
put	20
him	20
to	20
any	20
greater	20
straits	20
to	20
return	20
them	20
than	20
he	20
was	20
in	20
when	20
I	20
lent	20
them	20
to	20
him;	20
but	20
thinking	20
he	20
was	20
growing	20
careless	20
about	20
payment	20
I	20
asked	20
for	20
them	20
once	20
and	20
several	20
times;	20
and	20
not	20
only	20
will	20
he	20
not	20
give	20
them	20
back,	20
but	20
he	20
denies	20
that	20
he	20
owes	20
them,	20
and	20
says	20
I	20
never	20
lent	20
him	20
any	20
such	20
crowns;	20
or	20
if	20
I	20
did,	20
that	20
he	20
repaid	20
them;	20
and	20
I	20
have	20
no	20
witnesses	20
either	20
of	20
the	20
loan,	20
or	20
the	20
payment,	20
for	20
he	20
never	20
paid	20
me;	20
I	20
want	20
your	20
worship	20
to	20
put	20
him	20
to	20
his	20
oath,	20
and	20
if	20
he	20
swears	20
he	20
returned	20
them	20
to	20
me	20
I	20
forgive	20
him	20
the	20
debt	20
here	20
and	20
before	20
God.”	20

“What	20
say	20
you	20
to	20
this,	20
good	20
old	20
man,	20
you	20
with	20
the	20
stick?”	20
said	20
Sancho.	20
To	20
which	20
the	20
old	20
man	20
replied,	20
“I	20
admit,	20
señor,	20
that	20
he	20
lent	20
them	20
to	20
me;	20
but	20
let	20
your	20
worship	20
lower	20
your	20
staff,	20
and	20
as	20
he	20
leaves	20
it	20
to	20
my	20
oath,	20
I’ll	20
swear	20
that	20
I	20
gave	20
them	20
back,	20
and	20
paid	20
him	20
really	20
and	20
truly.”	20
The	20
governor	20
lowered	20
the	20
staff,	20
and	20
as	20
he	20
did	20
so	20
the	20
old	20
man	20
who	20
had	20
the	20
stick	20
handed	20
it	20
to	20
the	20
other	20
old	20
man	20
to	20
hold	20
for	20
him	20
while	20
he	20
swore,	20
as	20
if	20
he	20
found	20
it	20
in	20
his	20
way;	20
and	20
then	20
laid	20
his	20
hand	20
on	20
the	20
cross	20
of	20
the	20
staff,	20
saying	20
that	20
it	20
was	20
true	20
the	20
ten	20
crowns	20
that	20
were	20
demanded	20
of	20
him	20
had	20
been	20
lent	20
him;	20
but	20
that	20
he	20
had	20
with	20
his	20
own	20
hand	20
given	20
them	20
back	20
into	20
the	20
hand	20
of	20
the	20
other,	20
and	20
that	20
he,	20
not	20
recollecting	20
it,	20
was	20
always	20
asking	20
for	20
them.	20
Seeing	20
this	20
the	20
great	20
governor	20
asked	20
the	20
creditor	20
what	20
answer	20
he	20
had	20
to	20
make	20
to	20
what	20
his	20
opponent	20
said.	20
He	20
said	20
that	20
no	20
doubt	20
his	20
debtor	20
had	20
told	20
the	20
truth,	20
for	20
he	20
believed	20
him	20
to	20
be	20
an	20
honest	20
man	20
and	20
a	20
good	20
Christian,	20
and	20
he	20
himself	20
must	20
have	20
forgotten	20
when	20
and	20
how	20
he	20
had	20
given	20
him	20
back	20
the	20
crowns;	20
and	20
that	20
from	20
that	20
time	20
forth	20
he	20
would	20
make	20
no	20
further	20
demand	20
upon	20
him.	20
The	20
debtor	20
took	20
his	20
stick	20
again,	20
and	20
bowing	20
his	20
head	20
left	20
the	20
court.	20
Observing	20
this,	20
and	20
how,	20
without	20
another	20
word,	20
he	20
made	20
off,	20
and	20
observing	20
too	20
the	20
resignation	20
of	20
the	20
plaintiff,	20
Sancho	20
buried	20
his	20
head	20
in	20
his	20
bosom	20
and	20
remained	20
for	20
a	20
short	20
space	20
in	20
deep	20
thought,	20
with	20
the	20
forefinger	20
of	20
his	20
right	20
hand	20
on	20
his	20
brow	20
and	20
nose;	20
then	20
he	20
raised	20
his	20
head	20
and	20
bade	20
them	20
call	20
back	20
the	20
old	20
man	20
with	20
the	20
stick,	20
for	20
he	20
had	20
already	20
taken	20
his	20
departure.	20
They	20
brought	20
him	20
back,	20
and	20
as	20
soon	20
as	20
Sancho	20
saw	20
him	20
he	20
said,	20
“Honest	20
man,	20
give	20
me	20
that	20
stick,	20
for	20
I	20
want	20
it.”	20
“Willingly,”	20
said	20
the	20
old	20
man;	20
“here	20
it	20
is	20
señor,”	20
and	20
he	20
put	20
it	20
into	20
his	20
hand.	20
Sancho	20
took	20
it	20
and,	20
handing	20
it	20
to	20
the	20
other	20
old	20
man,	20
said	20
to	20
him,	20
“Go,	20
and	20
God	20
be	20
with	20
you;	20
for	20
now	20
you	20
are	20
paid.”	20
“I,	20
señor!”	20
returned	20
the	20
old	20
man;	20
“why,	20
is	20
this	20
cane	20
worth	20
ten	20
gold-crowns?”	20
“Yes,”	20
said	20
the	20
governor,	20
“or	20
if	20
not	20
I	20
am	20
the	20
greatest	20
dolt	20
in	20
the	20
world;	20
now	20
you	20
will	20
see	20
whether	20
I	20
have	20
got	20
the	20
headpiece	20
to	20
govern	20
a	20
whole	20
kingdom;”	20
and	20
he	20
ordered	20
the	20
cane	20
to	20
be	20
broken	20
in	20
two,	20
there,	20
in	20
the	20
presence	20
of	20
all.	20
It	20
was	20
done,	20
and	20
in	20
the	20
middle	20
of	20
it	20
they	20
found	20
ten	20
gold-crowns.	20
All	20
were	20
filled	20
with	20
amazement,	20
and	20
looked	20
upon	20
their	20
governor	20
as	20
another	20
Solomon.	20
They	20
asked	20
him	20
how	20
he	20
had	20
come	20
to	20
the	20
conclusion	20
that	20
the	20
ten	20
crowns	20
were	20
in	20
the	20
cane;	20
he	20
replied,	20
that	20
observing	20
how	20
the	20
old	20
man	20
who	20
swore	20
gave	20
the	20
stick	20
to	20
his	20
opponent	20
while	20
he	20
was	20
taking	20
the	20
oath,	20
and	20
swore	20
that	20
he	20
had	20
really	20
and	20
truly	20
given	20
him	20
the	20
crowns,	20
and	20
how	20
as	20
soon	20
as	20
he	20
had	20
done	20
swearing	20
he	20
asked	20
for	20
the	20
stick	20
again,	20
it	20
came	20
into	20
his	20
head	20
that	20
the	20
sum	20
demanded	20
must	20
be	20
inside	20
it;	20
and	20
from	20
this	20
he	20
said	20
it	20
might	20
be	20
seen	20
that	20
God	20
sometimes	20
guides	20
those	20
who	20
govern	20
in	20
their	20
judgments,	20
even	20
though	20
they	20
may	20
be	20
fools;	20
besides	20
he	20
had	20
himself	20
heard	20
the	20
curate	20
of	20
his	20
village	20
mention	20
just	20
such	20
another	20
case,	20
and	20
he	20
had	20
so	20
good	20
a	20
memory,	20
that	20
if	20
it	20
was	20
not	20
that	20
he	20
forgot	20
everything	20
he	20
wished	20
to	20
remember,	20
there	20
would	20
not	20
be	20
such	20
a	20
memory	20
in	20
all	20
the	20
island.	20
To	20
conclude,	20
the	20
old	20
men	20
went	20
off,	20
one	20
crestfallen,	20
and	20
the	20
other	20
in	20
high	20
contentment,	20
all	20
who	20
were	20
present	20
were	20
astonished,	20
and	20
he	20
who	20
was	20
recording	20
the	20
words,	20
deeds,	20
and	20
movements	20
of	20
Sancho	20
could	20
not	20
make	20
up	20
his	20
mind	20
whether	20
he	20
was	20
to	20
look	20
upon	20
him	20
and	20
set	20
him	20
down	20
as	20
a	20
fool	20
or	20
as	20
a	20
man	20
of	20
sense.	20
As	20
soon	20
as	20
this	20
case	20
was	20
disposed	20
of,	20
there	20
came	20
into	20
court	20
a	20
woman	20
holding	20
on	20
with	20
a	20
tight	20
grip	20
to	20
a	20
man	20
dressed	20
like	20
a	20
well-to-do	20
cattle	20
dealer,	20
and	20
she	20
came	20
forward	20
making	20
a	20
great	20
outcry	20
and	20
exclaiming,	20
“Justice,	20
señor	20
governor,	20
justice!	20
and	20
if	20
I	20
don’t	20
get	20
it	20
on	20
earth	20
I’ll	20
go	20
look	20
for	20
it	20
in	20
heaven.	20
Señor	20
governor	20
of	20
my	20
soul,	20
this	20
wicked	20
man	20
caught	20
me	20
in	20
the	20
middle	20
of	20
the	20
fields	20
here	20
and	20
used	20
my	20
body	20
as	20
if	20
it	20
was	20
an	20
ill-washed	20
rag,	20
and,	20
woe	20
is	20
me!	20
got	20
from	20
me	20
what	20
I	20
had	20
kept	20
these	20
three-and-twenty	20
years	20
and	20
more,	20
defending	20
it	20
against	20
Moors	20
and	20
Christians,	20
natives	20
and	20
strangers;	20
and	20
I	20
always	20
as	20
hard	20
as	20
an	20
oak,	20
and	20
keeping	20
myself	20
as	20
pure	20
as	20
a	20
salamander	20
in	20
the	20
fire,	20
or	20
wool	20
among	20
the	20
brambles,	20
for	20
this	20
good	20
fellow	20
to	20
come	20
now	20
with	20
clean	20
hands	20
to	20
handle	20
me!”	20
“It	20
remains	20
to	20
be	20
proved	20
whether	20
this	20
gallant	20
has	20
clean	20
hands	20
or	20
not,”	20
said	20
Sancho;	20
and	20
turning	20
to	20
the	20
man	20
he	20
asked	20
him	20
what	20
he	20
had	20
to	20
say	20
in	20
answer	20
to	20
the	20
woman’s	20
charge.	20
He	20
all	20
in	20
confusion	20
made	20
answer,	20
“Sirs,	20
I	20
am	20
a	20
poor	20
pig	20
dealer,	20
and	20
this	20
morning	20
I	20
left	20
the	20
village	20
to	20
sell	20
(saving	20
your	20
presence)	20
four	20
pigs,	20
and	20
between	20
dues	20
and	20
cribbings	20
they	20
got	20
out	20
of	20
me	20
little	20
less	20
than	20
the	20
worth	20
of	20
them.	20
As	20
I	20
was	20
returning	20
to	20
my	20
village	20
I	20
fell	20
in	20
on	20
the	20
road	20
with	20
this	20
good	20
dame,	20
and	20
the	20
devil	20
who	20
makes	20
a	20
coil	20
and	20
a	20
mess	20
out	20
of	20
everything,	20
yoked	20
us	20
together.	20
I	20
paid	20
her	20
fairly,	20
but	20
she	20
not	20
contented	20
laid	20
hold	20
of	20
me	20
and	20
never	20
let	20
go	20
until	20
she	20
brought	20
me	20
here;	20
she	20
says	20
I	20
forced	20
her,	20
but	20
she	20
lies	20
by	20
the	20
oath	20
I	20
swear	20
or	20
am	20
ready	20
to	20
swear;	20
and	20
this	20
is	20
the	20
whole	20
truth	20
and	20
every	20
particle	20
of	20
it.”	20
The	20
governor	20
on	20
this	20
asked	20
him	20
if	20
he	20
had	20
any	20
money	20
in	20
silver	20
about	20
him;	20
he	20
said	20
he	20
had	20
about	20
twenty	20
ducats	20
in	20
a	20
leather	20
purse	20
in	20
his	20
bosom.	20
The	20
governor	20
bade	20
him	20
take	20
it	20
out	20
and	20
hand	20
it	20
to	20
the	20
complainant;	20
he	20
obeyed	20
trembling;	20
the	20
woman	20
took	20
it,	20
and	20
making	20
a	20
thousand	20
salaams	20
to	20
all	20
and	20
praying	20
to	20
God	20
for	20
the	20
long	20
life	20
and	20
health	20
of	20
the	20
señor	20
governor	20
who	20
had	20
such	20
regard	20
for	20
distressed	20
orphans	20
and	20
virgins,	20
she	20
hurried	20
out	20
of	20
court	20
with	20
the	20
purse	20
grasped	20
in	20
both	20
her	20
hands,	20
first	20
looking,	20
however,	20
to	20
see	20
if	20
the	20
money	20
it	20
contained	20
was	20
silver.	20
As	20
soon	20
as	20
she	20
was	20
gone	20
Sancho	20
said	20
to	20
the	20
cattle	20
dealer,	20
whose	20
tears	20
were	20
already	20
starting	20
and	20
whose	20
eyes	20
and	20
heart	20
were	20
following	20
his	20
purse,	20
“Good	20
fellow,	20
go	20
after	20
that	20
woman	20
and	20
take	20
the	20
purse	20
from	20
her,	20
by	20
force	20
even,	20
and	20
come	20
back	20
with	20
it	20
here;”	20
and	20
he	20
did	20
not	20
say	20
it	20
to	20
one	20
who	20
was	20
a	20
fool	20
or	20
deaf,	20
for	20
the	20
man	20
was	20
off	20
like	20
a	20
flash	20
of	20
lightning,	20
and	20
ran	20
to	20
do	20
as	20
he	20
was	20
bid.	20
All	20
the	20
bystanders	20
waited	20
anxiously	20
to	20
see	20
the	20
end	20
of	20
the	20
case,	20
and	20
presently	20
both	20
man	20
and	20
woman	20
came	20
back	20
at	20
even	20
closer	20
grips	20
than	20
before,	20
she	20
with	20
her	20
petticoat	20
up	20
and	20
the	20
purse	20
in	20
the	20
lap	20
of	20
it,	20
and	20
he	20
struggling	20
hard	20
to	20
take	20
it	20
from	20
her,	20
but	20
all	20
to	20
no	20
purpose,	20
so	20
stout	20
was	20
the	20
woman’s	20
defence,	20
she	20
all	20
the	20
while	20
crying	20
out,	20
“Justice	20
from	20
God	20
and	20
the	20
world!	20
see	20
here,	20
señor	20
governor,	20
the	20
shamelessness	20
and	20
boldness	20
of	20
this	20
villain,	20
who	20
in	20
the	20
middle	20
of	20
the	20
town,	20
in	20
the	20
middle	20
of	20
the	20
street,	20
wanted	20
to	20
take	20
from	20
me	20
the	20
purse	20
your	20
worship	20
bade	20
him	20
give	20
me.”	20
“And	20
did	20
he	20
take	20
it?”	20
asked	20
the	20
governor.	20
“Take	20
it!”	20
said	20
the	20
woman;	20
“I’d	20
let	20
my	20
life	20
be	20
taken	20
from	20
me	20
sooner	20
than	20
the	20
purse.	20
A	20
pretty	20
child	20
I’d	20
be!	20
It’s	20
another	20
sort	20
of	20
cat	20
they	20
must	20
throw	20
in	20
my	20
face,	20
and	20
not	20
that	20
poor	20
scurvy	20
knave.	20
Pincers	20
and	20
hammers,	20
mallets	20
and	20
chisels	20
would	20
not	20
get	20
it	20
out	20
of	20
my	20
grip;	20
no,	20
nor	20
lions’	20
claws;	20
the	20
soul	20
from	20
out	20
of	20
my	20
body	20
first!”	20
“She	20
is	20
right,”	20
said	20
the	20
man;	20
“I	20
own	20
myself	20
beaten	20
and	20
powerless;	20
I	20
confess	20
I	20
haven’t	20
the	20
strength	20
to	20
take	20
it	20
from	20
her;”	20
and	20
he	20
let	20
go	20
his	20
hold	20
of	20
her.	20
Upon	20
this	20
the	20
governor	20
said	20
to	20
the	20
woman,	20
“Let	20
me	20
see	20
that	20
purse,	20
my	20
worthy	20
and	20
sturdy	20
friend.”	20
She	20
handed	20
it	20
to	20
him	20
at	20
once,	20
and	20
the	20
governor	20
returned	20
it	20
to	20
the	20
man,	20
and	20
said	20
to	20
the	20
unforced	20
mistress	20
of	20
force,	20
“Sister,	20
if	20
you	20
had	20
shown	20
as	20
much,	20
or	20
only	20
half	20
as	20
much,	20
spirit	20
and	20
vigour	20
in	20
defending	20
your	20
body	20
as	20
you	20
have	20
shown	20
in	20
defending	20
that	20
purse,	20
the	20
strength	20
of	20
Hercules	20
could	20
not	20
have	20
forced	20
you.	20
Be	20
off,	20
and	20
God	20
speed	20
you,	20
and	20
bad	20
luck	20
to	20
you,	20
and	20
don’t	20
show	20
your	20
face	20
in	20
all	20
this	20
island,	20
or	20
within	20
six	20
leagues	20
of	20
it	20
on	20
any	20
side,	20
under	20
pain	20
of	20
two	20
hundred	20
lashes;	20
be	20
off	20
at	20
once,	20
I	20
say,	20
you	20
shameless,	20
cheating	20
shrew.”	20
The	20
woman	20
was	20
cowed	20
and	20
went	20
off	20
disconsolately,	20
hanging	20
her	20
head;	20
and	20
the	20
governor	20
said	20
to	20
the	20
man,	20
“Honest	20
man,	20
go	20
home	20
with	20
your	20
money,	20
and	20
God	20
speed	20
you;	20
and	20
for	20
the	20
future,	20
if	20
you	20
don’t	20
want	20
to	20
lose	20
it,	20
see	20
that	20
you	20
don’t	20
take	20
it	20
into	20
your	20
head	20
to	20
yoke	20
with	20
anybody.”	20
The	20
man	20
thanked	20
him	20
as	20
clumsily	20
as	20
he	20
could	20
and	20
went	20
his	20
way,	20
and	20
the	20
bystanders	20
were	20
again	20
filled	20
with	20
admiration	20
at	20
their	20
new	20
governor’s	20
judgments	20
and	20
sentences.	20
Next,	20
two	20
men,	20
one	20
apparently	20
a	20
farm	20
labourer,	20
and	20
the	20
other	20
a	20
tailor,	20
for	20
he	20
had	20
a	20
pair	20
of	20
shears	20
in	20
his	20
hand,	20
presented	20
themselves	20
before	20
him,	20
and	20
the	20
tailor	20
said,	20
“Señor	20
governor,	20
this	20
labourer	20
and	20
I	20
come	20
before	20
your	20
worship	20
by	20
reason	20
of	20
this	20
honest	20
man	20
coming	20
to	20
my	20
shop	20
yesterday	20
(for	20
saving	20
everybody’s	20
presence	20
I’m	20
a	20
passed	20
tailor,	20
God	20
be	20
thanked),	20
and	20
putting	20
a	20
piece	20
of	20
cloth	20
into	20
my	20
hands	20
and	20
asking	20
me,	20
‘Señor,	20
will	20
there	20
be	20
enough	20
in	20
this	20
cloth	20
to	20
make	20
me	20
a	20
cap?’	20
Measuring	20
the	20
cloth	20
I	20
said	20
there	20
would.	20
He	20
probably	20
suspected—as	20
I	20
supposed,	20
and	20
I	20
supposed	20
right—that	20
I	20
wanted	20
to	20
steal	20
some	20
of	20
the	20
cloth,	20
led	20
to	20
think	20
so	20
by	20
his	20
own	20
roguery	20
and	20
the	20
bad	20
opinion	20
people	20
have	20
of	20
tailors;	20
and	20
he	20
told	20
me	20
to	20
see	20
if	20
there	20
would	20
be	20
enough	20
for	20
two.	20
I	20
guessed	20
what	20
he	20
would	20
be	20
at,	20
and	20
I	20
said	20
‘yes.’	20
He,	20
still	20
following	20
up	20
his	20
original	20
unworthy	20
notion,	20
went	20
on	20
adding	20
cap	20
after	20
cap,	20
and	20
I	20
‘yes’	20
after	20
‘yes,’	20
until	20
we	20
got	20
as	20
far	20
as	20
five.	20
He	20
has	20
just	20
this	20
moment	20
come	20
for	20
them;	20
I	20
gave	20
them	20
to	20
him,	20
but	20
he	20
won’t	20
pay	20
me	20
for	20
the	20
making;	20
on	20
the	20
contrary,	20
he	20
calls	20
upon	20
me	20
to	20
pay	20
him,	20
or	20
else	20
return	20
his	20
cloth.”	20
“Is	20
all	20
this	20
true,	20
brother?”	20
said	20
Sancho.	20
“Yes,”	20
replied	20
the	20
man;	20
“but	20
will	20
your	20
worship	20
make	20
him	20
show	20
the	20
five	20
caps	20
he	20
has	20
made	20
me?”	20
“With	20
all	20
my	20
heart,”	20
said	20
the	20
tailor;	20
and	20
drawing	20
his	20
hand	20
from	20
under	20
his	20
cloak	20
he	20
showed	20
five	20
caps	20
stuck	20
upon	20
the	20
five	20
fingers	20
of	20
it,	20
and	20
said,	20
“there	20
are	20
the	20
caps	20
this	20
good	20
man	20
asks	20
for;	20
and	20
by	20
God	20
and	20
upon	20
my	20
conscience	20
I	20
haven’t	20
a	20
scrap	20
of	20
cloth	20
left,	20
and	20
I’ll	20
let	20
the	20
work	20
be	20
examined	20
by	20
the	20
inspectors	20
of	20
the	20
trade.”	20
All	20
present	20
laughed	20
at	20
the	20
number	20
of	20
caps	20
and	20
the	20
novelty	20
of	20
the	20
suit;	20
Sancho	20
set	20
himself	20
to	20
think	20
for	20
a	20
moment,	20
and	20
then	20
said,	20
“It	20
seems	20
to	20
me	20
that	20
in	20
this	20
case	20
it	20
is	20
not	20
necessary	20
to	20
deliver	20
long-winded	20
arguments,	20
but	20
only	20
to	20
give	20
off-hand	20
the	20
judgment	20
of	20
an	20
honest	20
man;	20
and	20
so	20
my	20
decision	20
is	20
that	20
the	20
tailor	20
lose	20
the	20
making	20
and	20
the	20
labourer	20
the	20
cloth,	20
and	20
that	20
the	20
caps	20
go	20
to	20
the	20
prisoners	20
in	20
the	20
gaol,	20
and	20
let	20
there	20
be	20
no	20
more	20
about	20
it.”	20
If	20
the	20
previous	20
decision	20
about	20
the	20
cattle	20
dealer’s	20
purse	20
excited	20
the	20
admiration	20
of	20
the	20
bystanders,	20
this	20
provoked	20
their	20
laughter;	20
however,	20
the	20
governor’s	20
orders	20
were	20
after	20
all	20
executed.	20
All	20
this,	20
having	20
been	20
taken	20
down	20
by	20
his	20
chronicler,	20
was	20
at	20
once	20
despatched	20
to	20
the	20
duke,	20
who	20
was	20
looking	20
out	20
for	20
it	20
with	20
great	20
eagerness;	20
and	20
here	20
let	20
us	20
leave	20
the	20
good	20
Sancho;	20
for	20
his	20
master,	20
sorely	20
troubled	20
in	20
mind	20
by	20
Altisidora’s	20
music,	20
has	20
pressing	20
claims	20
upon	20
us	20
now.	20

We	20
left	20
Don	20
Quixote	20
wrapped	20
up	20
in	20
the	20
reflections	20
which	20
the	20
music	20
of	20
the	20
enamourned	20
maid	20
Altisidora	20
had	20
given	20
rise	20
to.	20
He	20
went	20
to	20
bed	20
with	20
them,	20
and	20
just	20
like	20
fleas	20
they	20
would	20
not	20
let	20
him	20
sleep	20
or	20
get	20
a	20
moment’s	20
rest,	20
and	20
the	20
broken	20
stitches	20
of	20
his	20
stockings	20
helped	20
them.	20
But	20
as	20
Time	20
is	20
fleet	20
and	20
no	20
obstacle	20
can	20
stay	20
his	20
course,	20
he	20
came	20
riding	20
on	20
the	20
hours,	20
and	20
morning	20
very	20
soon	20
arrived.	20
Seeing	20
which	20
Don	20
Quixote	20
quitted	20
the	20
soft	20
down,	20
and,	20
nowise	20
slothful,	20
dressed	20
himself	20
in	20
his	20
chamois	20
suit	20
and	20
put	20
on	20
his	20
travelling	20
boots	20
to	20
hide	20
the	20
disaster	20
to	20
his	20
stockings.	20
He	20
threw	20
over	20
him	20
his	20
scarlet	20
mantle,	20
put	20
on	20
his	20
head	20
a	20
montera	20
of	20
green	20
velvet	20
trimmed	20
with	20
silver	20
edging,	20
flung	20
across	20
his	20
shoulder	20
the	20
baldric	20
with	20
his	20
good	20
trenchant	20
sword,	20
took	20
up	20
a	20
large	20
rosary	20
that	20
he	20
always	20
carried	20
with	20
him,	20
and	20
with	20
great	20
solemnity	20
and	20
precision	20
of	20
gait	20
proceeded	20
to	20
the	20
antechamber	20
where	20
the	20
duke	20
and	20
duchess	20
were	20
already	20
dressed	20
and	20
waiting	20
for	20
him.	20
But	20
as	20
he	20
passed	20
through	20
a	20
gallery,	20
Altisidora	20
and	20
the	20
other	20
damsel,	20
her	20
friend,	20
were	20
lying	20
in	20
wait	20
for	20
him,	20
and	20
the	20
instant	20
Altisidora	20
saw	20
him	20
she	20
pretended	20
to	20
faint,	20
while	20
her	20
friend	20
caught	20
her	20
in	20
her	20
lap,	20
and	20
began	20
hastily	20
unlacing	20
the	20
bosom	20
of	20
her	20
dress.	20
Don	20
Quixote	20
observed	20
it,	20
and	20
approaching	20
them	20
said,	20
“I	20
know	20
very	20
well	20
what	20
this	20
seizure	20
arises	20
from.”	20
“I	20
know	20
not	20
from	20
what,”	20
replied	20
the	20
friend,	20
“for	20
Altisidora	20
is	20
the	20
healthiest	20
damsel	20
in	20
all	20
this	20
house,	20
and	20
I	20
have	20
never	20
heard	20
her	20
complain	20
all	20
the	20
time	20
I	20
have	20
known	20
her.	20
A	20
plague	20
on	20
all	20
the	20
knights-errant	20
in	20
the	20
world,	20
if	20
they	20
be	20
all	20
ungrateful!	20
Go	20
away,	20
Señor	20
Don	20
Quixote;	20
for	20
this	20
poor	20
child	20
will	20
not	20
come	20
to	20
herself	20
again	20
so	20
long	20
as	20
you	20
are	20
here.”	20

To	20
which	20
Don	20
Quixote	20
returned,	20
“Do	20
me	20
the	20
favour,	20
señora,	20
to	20
let	20
a	20
lute	20
be	20
placed	20
in	20
my	20
chamber	20
to-night;	20
and	20
I	20
will	20
comfort	20
this	20
poor	20
maiden	20
to	20
the	20
best	20
of	20
my	20
power;	20
for	20
in	20
the	20
early	20
stages	20
of	20
love	20
a	20
prompt	20
disillusion	20
is	20
an	20
approved	20
remedy;”	20
and	20
with	20
this	20
he	20
retired,	20
so	20
as	20
not	20
to	20
be	20
remarked	20
by	20
any	20
who	20
might	20
see	20
him	20
there.	20
He	20
had	20
scarcely	20
withdrawn	20
when	20
Altisidora,	20
recovering	20
from	20
her	20
swoon,	20
said	20
to	20
her	20
companion,	20
“The	20
lute	20
must	20
be	20
left,	20
for	20
no	20
doubt	20
Don	20
Quixote	20
intends	20
to	20
give	20
us	20
some	20
music;	20
and	20
being	20
his	20
it	20
will	20
not	20
be	20
bad.”	20
They	20
went	20
at	20
once	20
to	20
inform	20
the	20
duchess	20
of	20
what	20
was	20
going	20
on,	20
and	20
of	20
the	20
lute	20
Don	20
Quixote	20
asked	20
for,	20
and	20
she,	20
delighted	20
beyond	20
measure,	20
plotted	20
with	20
the	20
duke	20
and	20
her	20
two	20
damsels	20
to	20
play	20
him	20
a	20
trick	20
that	20
should	20
be	20
amusing	20
but	20
harmless;	20
and	20
in	20
high	20
glee	20
they	20
waited	20
for	20
night,	20
which	20
came	20
quickly	20
as	20
the	20
day	20
had	20
come;	20
and	20
as	20
for	20
the	20
day,	20
the	20
duke	20
and	20
duchess	20
spent	20
it	20
in	20
charming	20
conversation	20
with	20
Don	20
Quixote.	20
When	20
eleven	20
o’clock	20
came,	20
Don	20
Quixote	20
found	20
a	20
guitar	20
in	20
his	20
chamber;	20
he	20
tried	20
it,	20
opened	20
the	20
window,	20
and	20
perceived	20
that	20
some	20
persons	20
were	20
walking	20
in	20
the	20
garden;	20
and	20
having	20
passed	20
his	20
fingers	20
over	20
the	20
frets	20
of	20
the	20
guitar	20
and	20
tuned	20
it	20
as	20
well	20
as	20
he	20
could,	20
he	20
spat	20
and	20
cleared	20
his	20
chest,	20
and	20
then	20
with	20
a	20
voice	20
a	20
little	20
hoarse	20
but	20
full-toned,	20
he	20
sang	20
the	20
following	20
ballad,	20
which	20
he	20
had	20
himself	20
that	20
day	20
composed:	20
Mighty	20
Love	20
the	20
hearts	20
of	20
maidens	20
Doth	20
unsettle	20
and	20
perplex,	20
And	20
the	20
instrument	20
he	20
uses	20
Most	20
of	20
all	20
is	20
idleness.	20
Sewing,	20
stitching,	20
any	20
labour,	20
Having	20
always	20
work	20
to	20
do,	20
To	20
the	20
poison	20
Love	20
instilleth	20
Is	20
the	20
antidote	20
most	20
sure.	20
And	20
to	20
proper-minded	20
maidens	20
Who	20
desire	20
the	20
matron’s	20
name	20
Modesty’s	20
a	20
marriage	20
portion,	20
Modesty	20
their	20
highest	20
praise.	20
Men	20
of	20
prudence	20
and	20
discretion,	20
Courtiers	20
gay	20
and	20
gallant	20
knights,	20
With	20
the	20
wanton	20
damsels	20
dally,	20
But	20
the	20
modest	20
take	20
to	20
wife.	20
There	20
are	20
passions,	20
transient,	20
fleeting,	20
Loves	20
in	20
hostelries	20
declar’d,	20
Sunrise	20
loves,	20
with	20
sunset	20
ended,	20
When	20
the	20
guest	20
hath	20
gone	20
his	20
way.	20
Love	20
that	20
springs	20
up	20
swift	20
and	20
sudden,	20
Here	20
to-day,	20
to-morrow	20
flown,	20
Passes,	20
leaves	20
no	20
trace	20
behind	20
it,	20
Leaves	20
no	20
image	20
on	20
the	20
soul.	20
Painting	20
that	20
is	20
laid	20
on	20
painting	20
Maketh	20
no	20
display	20
or	20
show;	20
Where	20
one	20
beauty’s	20
in	20
possession	20
There	20
no	20
other	20
can	20
take	20
hold.	20
Dulcinea	20
del	20
Toboso	20
Painted	20
on	20
my	20
heart	20
I	20
wear;	20
Never	20
from	20
its	20
tablets,	20
never,	20
Can	20
her	20
image	20
be	20
eras’d.	20
The	20
quality	20
of	20
all	20
in	20
lovers	20
Most	20
esteemed	20
is	20
constancy;	20
’Tis	20
by	20
this	20
that	20
love	20
works	20
wonders,	20
This	20
exalts	20
them	20
to	20
the	20
skies.	20
Don	20
Quixote	20
had	20
got	20
so	20
far	20
with	20
his	20
song,	20
to	20
which	20
the	20
duke,	20
the	20
duchess,	20
Altisidora,	20
and	20
nearly	20
the	20
whole	20
household	20
of	20
the	20
castle	20
were	20
listening,	20
when	20
all	20
of	20
a	20
sudden	20
from	20
a	20
gallery	20
above	20
that	20
was	20
exactly	20
over	20
his	20
window	20
they	20
let	20
down	20
a	20
cord	20
with	20
more	20
than	20
a	20
hundred	20
bells	20
attached	20
to	20
it,	20
and	20
immediately	20
after	20
that	20
discharged	20
a	20
great	20
sack	20
full	20
of	20
cats,	20
which	20
also	20
had	20
bells	20
of	20
smaller	20
size	20
tied	20
to	20
their	20
tails.	20
Such	20
was	20
the	20
din	20
of	20
the	20
bells	20
and	20
the	20
squalling	20
of	20
the	20
cats,	20
that	20
though	20
the	20
duke	20
and	20
duchess	20
were	20
the	20
contrivers	20
of	20
the	20
joke	20
they	20
were	20
startled	20
by	20
it,	20
while	20
Don	20
Quixote	20
stood	20
paralysed	20
with	20
fear;	20
and	20
as	20
luck	20
would	20
have	20
it,	20
two	20
or	20
three	20
of	20
the	20
cats	20
made	20
their	20
way	20
in	20
through	20
the	20
grating	20
of	20
his	20
chamber,	20
and	20
flying	20
from	20
one	20
side	20
to	20
the	20
other,	20
made	20
it	20
seem	20
as	20
if	20
there	20
was	20
a	20
legion	20
of	20
devils	20
at	20
large	20
in	20
it.	20
They	20
extinguished	20
the	20
candles	20
that	20
were	20
burning	20
in	20
the	20
room,	20
and	20
rushed	20
about	20
seeking	20
some	20
way	20
of	20
escape;	20
the	20
cord	20
with	20
the	20
large	20
bells	20
never	20
ceased	20
rising	20
and	20
falling;	20
and	20
most	20
of	20
the	20
people	20
of	20
the	20
castle,	20
not	20
knowing	20
what	20
was	20
really	20
the	20
matter,	20
were	20
at	20
their	20
wits’	20
end	20
with	20
astonishment.	20
Don	20
Quixote	20
sprang	20
to	20
his	20
feet,	20
and	20
drawing	20
his	20
sword,	20
began	20
making	20
passes	20
at	20
the	20
grating,	20
shouting	20
out,	20
“Avaunt,	20
malignant	20
enchanters!	20
avaunt,	20
ye	20
witchcraft-working	20
rabble!	20
I	20
am	20
Don	20
Quixote	20
of	20
La	20
Mancha,	20
against	20
whom	20
your	20
evil	20
machinations	20
avail	20
not	20
nor	20
have	20
any	20
power.”	20
And	20
turning	20
upon	20
the	20
cats	20
that	20
were	20
running	20
about	20
the	20
room,	20
he	20
made	20
several	20
cuts	20
at	20
them.	20
They	20
dashed	20
at	20
the	20
grating	20
and	20
escaped	20
by	20
it,	20
save	20
one	20
that,	20
finding	20
itself	20
hard	20
pressed	20
by	20
the	20
slashes	20
of	20
Don	20
Quixote’s	20
sword,	20
flew	20
at	20
his	20
face	20
and	20
held	20
on	20
to	20
his	20
nose	20
tooth	20
and	20
nail,	20
with	20
the	20
pain	20
of	20
which	20
he	20
began	20
to	20
shout	20
his	20
loudest.	20
The	20
duke	20
and	20
duchess	20
hearing	20
this,	20
and	20
guessing	20
what	20
it	20
was,	20
ran	20
with	20
all	20
haste	20
to	20
his	20
room,	20
and	20
as	20
the	20
poor	20
gentleman	20
was	20
striving	20
with	20
all	20
his	20
might	20
to	20
detach	20
the	20
cat	20
from	20
his	20
face,	20
they	20
opened	20
the	20
door	20
with	20
a	20
master-key	20
and	20
went	20
in	20
with	20
lights	20
and	20
witnessed	20
the	20
unequal	20
combat.	20
The	20
duke	20
ran	20
forward	20
to	20
part	20
the	20
combatants,	20
but	20
Don	20
Quixote	20
cried	20
out	20
aloud,	20
“Let	20
no	20
one	20
take	20
him	20
from	20
me;	20
leave	20
me	20
hand	20
to	20
hand	20
with	20
this	20
demon,	20
this	20
wizard,	20
this	20
enchanter;	20
I	20
will	20
teach	20
him,	20
I	20
myself,	20
who	20
Don	20
Quixote	20
of	20
La	20
Mancha	20
is.”	20
The	20
cat,	20
however,	20
never	20
minding	20
these	20
threats,	20
snarled	20
and	20
held	20
on;	20
but	20
at	20
last	20
the	20
duke	20
pulled	20
it	20
off	20
and	20
flung	20
it	20
out	20
of	20
the	20
window.	20
Don	20
Quixote	20
was	20
left	20
with	20
a	20
face	20
as	20
full	20
of	20
holes	20
as	20
a	20
sieve	20
and	20
a	20
nose	20
not	20
in	20
very	20
good	20
condition,	20
and	20
greatly	20
vexed	20
that	20
they	20
did	20
not	20
let	20
him	20
finish	20
the	20
battle	20
he	20
had	20
been	20
so	20
stoutly	20
fighting	20
with	20
that	20
villain	20
of	20
an	20
enchanter.	20
They	20
sent	20
for	20
some	20
oil	20
of	20
John’s	20
wort,	20
and	20
Altisidora	20
herself	20
with	20
her	20
own	20
fair	20
hands	20
bandaged	20
all	20
the	20
wounded	20
parts;	20
and	20
as	20
she	20
did	20
so	20
she	20
said	20
to	20
him	20
in	20
a	20
low	20
voice.	20
“All	20
these	20
mishaps	20
have	20
befallen	20
thee,	20
hardhearted	20
knight,	20
for	20
the	20
sin	20
of	20
thy	20
insensibility	20
and	20
obstinacy;	20
and	20
God	20
grant	20
thy	20
squire	20
Sancho	20
may	20
forget	20
to	20
whip	20
himself,	20
so	20
that	21
dearly	21
beloved	21
Dulcinea	21
of	21
thine	21
may	21
never	21
be	21
released	21
from	21
her	21
enchantment,	21
that	21
thou	21
mayest	21
never	21
come	21
to	21
her	21
bed,	21
at	21
least	21
while	21
I	21
who	21
adore	21
thee	21
am	21
alive.”	21
To	21
all	21
this	21
Don	21
Quixote	21
made	21
no	21
answer	21
except	21
to	21
heave	21
deep	21
sighs,	21
and	21
then	21
stretched	21
himself	21
on	21
his	21
bed,	21
thanking	21
the	21
duke	21
and	21
duchess	21
for	21
their	21
kindness,	21
not	21
because	21
he	21
stood	21
in	21
any	21
fear	21
of	21
that	21
bell-ringing	21
rabble	21
of	21
enchanters	21
in	21
cat	21
shape,	21
but	21
because	21
he	21
recognised	21
their	21
good	21
intentions	21
in	21
coming	21
to	21
his	21
rescue.	21
The	21
duke	21
and	21
duchess	21
left	21
him	21
to	21
repose	21
and	21
withdrew	21
greatly	21
grieved	21
at	21
the	21
unfortunate	21
result	21
of	21
the	21
joke;	21
as	21
they	21
never	21
thought	21
the	21
adventure	21
would	21
have	21
fallen	21
so	21
heavy	21
on	21
Don	21
Quixote	21
or	21
cost	21
him	21
so	21
dear,	21
for	21
it	21
cost	21
him	21
five	21
days	21
of	21
confinement	21
to	21
his	21
bed,	21
during	21
which	21
he	21
had	21
another	21
adventure,	21
pleasanter	21
than	21
the	21
late	21
one,	21
which	21
his	21
chronicler	21
will	21
not	21
relate	21
just	21
now	21
in	21
order	21
that	21
he	21
may	21
turn	21
his	21
attention	21
to	21
Sancho	21
Panza,	21
who	21
was	21
proceeding	21
with	21
great	21
diligence	21
and	21
drollery	21
in	21
his	21
government.	21

chamber	21
there	21
was	21
a	21
table	21
laid	21
out	21
with	21
royal	21
magnificence.	21
The	21
clarions	21
sounded	21
as	21
Sancho	21
entered	21
the	21
room,	21
and	21
four	21
pages	21
came	21
forward	21
to	21
present	21
him	21
with	21
water	21
for	21
his	21
hands,	21
which	21
Sancho	21
received	21
with	21
great	21
dignity.	21
The	21
music	21
ceased,	21
and	21
Sancho	21
seated	21
himself	21
at	21
the	21
head	21
of	21
the	21
table,	21
for	21
there	21
was	21
only	21
that	21
seat	21
placed,	21
and	21
no	21
more	21
than	21
one	21
cover	21
laid.	21
A	21
personage,	21
who	21
it	21
appeared	21
afterwards	21
was	21
a	21
physician,	21
placed	21
himself	21
standing	21
by	21
his	21
side	21
with	21
a	21
whalebone	21
wand	21
in	21
his	21
hand.	21
They	21
then	21
lifted	21
up	21
a	21
fine	21
white	21
cloth	21
covering	21
fruit	21
and	21
a	21
great	21
variety	21
of	21
dishes	21
of	21
different	21
sorts;	21
one	21
who	21
looked	21
like	21
a	21
student	21
said	21
grace,	21
and	21
a	21
page	21
put	21
a	21
laced	21
bib	21
on	21
Sancho,	21
while	21
another	21
who	21
played	21
the	21
part	21
of	21
head	21
carver	21
placed	21
a	21
dish	21
of	21
fruit	21
before	21
him.	21
But	21
hardly	21
had	21
he	21
tasted	21
a	21
morsel	21
when	21
the	21
man	21
with	21
the	21
wand	21
touched	21
the	21
plate	21
with	21
it,	21
and	21
they	21
took	21
it	21
away	21
from	21
before	21
him	21
with	21
the	21
utmost	21
celerity.	21
The	21
carver,	21
however,	21
brought	21
him	21
another	21
dish,	21
and	21
Sancho	21
proceeded	21
to	21
try	21
it;	21
but	21
before	21
he	21
could	21
get	21
at	21
it,	21
not	21
to	21
say	21
taste	21
it,	21
already	21
the	21
wand	21
had	21
touched	21
it	21
and	21
a	21
page	21
had	21
carried	21
it	21
off	21
with	21
the	21
same	21
promptitude	21
as	21
the	21
fruit.	21
Sancho	21
seeing	21
this	21
was	21
puzzled,	21
and	21
looking	21
from	21
one	21
to	21
another	21
asked	21
if	21
this	21
dinner	21
was	21
to	21
be	21
eaten	21
after	21
the	21
fashion	21
of	21
a	21
jugglery	21
trick.	21
To	21
this	21
he	21
with	21
the	21
wand	21
replied,	21
“It	21
is	21
not	21
to	21
be	21
eaten,	21
señor	21
governor,	21
except	21
as	21
is	21
usual	21
and	21
customary	21
in	21
other	21
islands	21
where	21
there	21
are	21
governors.	21
I,	21
señor,	21
am	21
a	21
physician,	21
and	21
I	21
am	21
paid	21
a	21
salary	21
in	21
this	21
island	21
to	21
serve	21
its	21
governors	21
as	21
such,	21
and	21
I	21
have	21
a	21
much	21
greater	21
regard	21
for	21
their	21
health	21
than	21
for	21
my	21
own,	21
studying	21
day	21
and	21
night	21
and	21
making	21
myself	21
acquainted	21
with	21
the	21
governor’s	21
constitution,	21
in	21
order	21
to	21
be	21
able	21
to	21
cure	21
him	21
when	21
he	21
falls	21
sick.	21
The	21
chief	21
thing	21
I	21
have	21
to	21
do	21
is	21
to	21
attend	21
at	21
his	21
dinners	21
and	21
suppers	21
and	21
allow	21
him	21
to	21
eat	21
what	21
appears	21
to	21
me	21
to	21
be	21
fit	21
for	21
him,	21
and	21
keep	21
from	21
him	21
what	21
I	21
think	21
will	21
do	21
him	21
harm	21
and	21
be	21
injurious	21
to	21
his	21
stomach;	21
and	21
therefore	21
I	21
ordered	21
that	21
plate	21
of	21
fruit	21
to	21
be	21
removed	21
as	21
being	21
too	21
moist,	21
and	21
that	21
other	21
dish	21
I	21
ordered	21
to	21
be	21
removed	21
as	21
being	21
too	21
hot	21
and	21
containing	21
many	21
spices	21
that	21
stimulate	21
thirst;	21
for	21
he	21
who	21
drinks	21
much	21
kills	21
and	21
consumes	21
the	21
radical	21
moisture	21
wherein	21
life	21
consists.”	21
“Well	21
then,”	21
said	21
Sancho,	21
“that	21
dish	21
of	21
roast	21
partridges	21
there	21
that	21
seems	21
so	21
savoury	21
will	21
not	21
do	21
me	21
any	21
harm.”	21
To	21
this	21
the	21
physician	21
replied,	21
“Of	21
those	21
my	21
lord	21
the	21
governor	21
shall	21
not	21
eat	21
so	21
long	21
as	21
I	21
live.”	21
“Why	21
so?”	21
said	21
Sancho.	21
“Because,”	21
replied	21
the	21
doctor,	21
“our	21
master	21
Hippocrates,	21
the	21
polestar	21
and	21
beacon	21
of	21
medicine,	21
says	21
in	21
one	21
of	21
his	21
aphorisms	21
_omnis	21
saturatio	21
mala,	21
perdicis	21
autem	21
pessima_,	21
which	21
means	21
‘all	21
repletion	21
is	21
bad,	21
but	21
that	21
of	21
partridge	21
is	21
the	21
worst	21
of	21
all.”	21
“In	21
that	21
case,”	21
said	21
Sancho,	21
“let	21
señor	21
doctor	21
see	21
among	21
the	21
dishes	21
that	21
are	21
on	21
the	21
table	21
what	21
will	21
do	21
me	21
most	21
good	21
and	21
least	21
harm,	21
and	21
let	21
me	21
eat	21
it,	21
without	21
tapping	21
it	21
with	21
his	21
stick;	21
for	21
by	21
the	21
life	21
of	21
the	21
governor,	21
and	21
so	21
may	21
God	21
suffer	21
me	21
to	21
enjoy	21
it,	21
but	21
I’m	21
dying	21
of	21
hunger;	21
and	21
in	21
spite	21
of	21
the	21
doctor	21
and	21
all	21
he	21
may	21
say,	21
to	21
deny	21
me	21
food	21
is	21
the	21
way	21
to	21
take	21
my	21
life	21
instead	21
of	21
prolonging	21
it.”	21
“Your	21
worship	21
is	21
right,	21
señor	21
governor,”	21
said	21
the	21
physician;	21
“and	21
therefore	21
your	21
worship,	21
I	21
consider,	21
should	21
not	21
eat	21
of	21
those	21
stewed	21
rabbits	21
there,	21
because	21
it	21
is	21
a	21
furry	21
kind	21
of	21
food;	21
if	21
that	21
veal	21
were	21
not	21
roasted	21
and	21
served	21
with	21
pickles,	21
you	21
might	21
try	21
it;	21
but	21
it	21
is	21
out	21
of	21
the	21
question.”	21
“That	21
big	21
dish	21
that	21
is	21
smoking	21
farther	21
off,”	21
said	21
Sancho,	21
“seems	21
to	21
me	21
to	21
be	21
an	21
olla	21
podrida,	21
and	21
out	21
of	21
the	21
diversity	21
of	21
things	21
in	21
such	21
ollas,	21
I	21
can’t	21
fail	21
to	21
light	21
upon	21
something	21
tasty	21
and	21
good	21
for	21
me.”	21

“_Absit_,”	21
said	21
the	21
doctor;	21
“far	21
from	21
us	21
be	21
any	21
such	21
base	21
thought!	21
There	21
is	21
nothing	21
in	21
the	21
world	21
less	21
nourishing	21
than	21
an	21
olla	21
podrida;	21
to	21
canons,	21
or	21
rectors	21
of	21
colleges,	21
or	21
peasants’	21
weddings	21
with	21
your	21
ollas	21
podridas,	21
but	21
let	21
us	21
have	21
none	21
of	21
them	21
on	21
the	21
tables	21
of	21
governors,	21
where	21
everything	21
that	21
is	21
present	21
should	21
be	21
delicate	21
and	21
refined;	21
and	21
the	21
reason	21
is,	21
that	21
always,	21
everywhere	21
and	21
by	21
everybody,	21
simple	21
medicines	21
are	21
more	21
esteemed	21
than	21
compound	21
ones,	21
for	21
we	21
cannot	21
go	21
wrong	21
in	21
those	21
that	21
are	21
simple,	21
while	21
in	21
the	21
compound	21
we	21
may,	21
by	21
merely	21
altering	21
the	21
quantity	21
of	21
the	21
things	21
composing	21
them.	21
But	21
what	21
I	21
am	21
of	21
opinion	21
the	21
governor	21
should	21
eat	21
now	21
in	21
order	21
to	21
preserve	21
and	21
fortify	21
his	21
health	21
is	21
a	21
hundred	21
or	21
so	21
of	21
wafer	21
cakes	21
and	21
a	21
few	21
thin	21
slices	21
of	21
conserve	21
of	21
quinces,	21
which	21
will	21
settle	21
his	21
stomach	21
and	21
help	21
his	21
digestion.”	21
Sancho	21
on	21
hearing	21
this	21
threw	21
himself	21
back	21
in	21
his	21
chair	21
and	21
surveyed	21
the	21
doctor	21
steadily,	21
and	21
in	21
a	21
solemn	21
tone	21
asked	21
him	21
what	21
his	21
name	21
was	21
and	21
where	21
he	21
had	21
studied.	21
He	21
replied,	21
“My	21
name,	21
señor	21
governor,	21
is	21
Doctor	21
Pedro	21
Recio	21
de	21
Aguero	21
I	21
am	21
a	21
native	21
of	21
a	21
place	21
called	21
Tirteafuera	21
which	21
lies	21
between	21
Caracuel	21
and	21
Almodóvar	21
del	21
Campo,	21
on	21
the	21
right-hand	21
side,	21
and	21
I	21
have	21
the	21
degree	21
of	21
doctor	21
from	21
the	21
university	21
of	21
Osuna.”	21
To	21
which	21
Sancho,	21
glowing	21
all	21
over	21
with	21
rage,	21
returned,	21
“Then	21
let	21
Doctor	21
Pedro	21
Recio	21
de	21
Malaguero,	21
native	21
of	21
Tirteafuera,	21
a	21
place	21
that’s	21
on	21
the	21
right-hand	21
side	21
as	21
we	21
go	21
from	21
Caracuel	21
to	21
Almodóvar	21
del	21
Campo,	21
graduate	21
of	21
Osuna,	21
get	21
out	21
of	21
my	21
presence	21
at	21
once;	21
or	21
I	21
swear	21
by	21
the	21
sun	21
I’ll	21
take	21
a	21
cudgel,	21
and	21
by	21
dint	21
of	21
blows,	21
beginning	21
with	21
him,	21
I’ll	21
not	21
leave	21
a	21
doctor	21
in	21
the	21
whole	21
island;	21
at	21
least	21
of	21
those	21
I	21
know	21
to	21
be	21
ignorant;	21
for	21
as	21
to	21
learned,	21
wise,	21
sensible	21
physicians,	21
them	21
I	21
will	21
reverence	21
and	21
honour	21
as	21
divine	21
persons.	21
Once	21
more	21
I	21
say	21
let	21
Pedro	21
Recio	21
get	21
out	21
of	21
this	21
or	21
I’ll	21
take	21
this	21
chair	21
I	21
am	21
sitting	21
on	21
and	21
break	21
it	21
over	21
his	21
head.	21
And	21
if	21
they	21
call	21
me	21
to	21
account	21
for	21
it,	21
I’ll	21
clear	21
myself	21
by	21
saying	21
I	21
served	21
God	21
in	21
killing	21
a	21
bad	21
doctor—a	21
general	21
executioner.	21
And	21
now	21
give	21
me	21
something	21
to	21
eat,	21
or	21
else	21
take	21
your	21
government;	21
for	21
a	21
trade	21
that	21
does	21
not	21
feed	21
its	21
master	21
is	21
not	21
worth	21
two	21
beans.”	21
The	21
doctor	21
was	21
dismayed	21
when	21
he	21
saw	21
the	21
governor	21
in	21
such	21
a	21
passion,	21
and	21
he	21
would	21
have	21
made	21
a	21
Tirteafuera	21
out	21
of	21
the	21
room	21
but	21
that	21
the	21
same	21
instant	21
a	21
post-horn	21
sounded	21
in	21
the	21
street;	21
and	21
the	21
carver	21
putting	21
his	21
head	21
out	21
of	21
the	21
window	21
turned	21
round	21
and	21
said,	21
“It’s	21
a	21
courier	21
from	21
my	21
lord	21
the	21
duke,	21
no	21
doubt	21
with	21
some	21
despatch	21
of	21
importance.”	21
The	21
courier	21
came	21
in	21
all	21
sweating	21
and	21
flurried,	21
and	21
taking	21
a	21
paper	21
from	21
his	21
bosom,	21
placed	21
it	21
in	21
the	21
governor’s	21
hands.	21
Sancho	21
handed	21
it	21
to	21
the	21
majordomo	21
and	21
bade	21
him	21
read	21
the	21
superscription,	21
which	21
ran	21
thus:	21
_To	21
Don	21
Sancho	21
Panza,	21
Governor	21
of	21
the	21
Island	21
of	21
Barataria,	21
into	21
his	21
own	21
hands	21
or	21
those	21
of	21
his	21
secretary._	21
Sancho	21
when	21
he	21
heard	21
this	21
said,	21
“Which	21
of	21
you	21
is	21
my	21
secretary?”	21
“I	21
am,	21
señor,”	21
said	21
one	21
of	21
those	21
present,	21
“for	21
I	21
can	21
read	21
and	21
write,	21
and	21
am	21
a	21
Biscayan.”	21
“With	21
that	21
addition,”	21
said	21
Sancho,	21
“you	21
might	21
be	21
secretary	21
to	21
the	21
emperor	21
himself;	21
open	21
this	21
paper	21
and	21
see	21
what	21
it	21
says.”	21
The	21
new-born	21
secretary	21
obeyed,	21
and	21
having	21
read	21
the	21
contents	21
said	21
the	21
matter	21
was	21
one	21
to	21
be	21
discussed	21
in	21
private.	21
Sancho	21
ordered	21
the	21
chamber	21
to	21
be	21
cleared,	21
the	21
majordomo	21
and	21
the	21
carver	21
only	21
remaining;	21
so	21
the	21
doctor	21
and	21
the	21
others	21
withdrew,	21
and	21
then	21
the	21
secretary	21
read	21
the	21
letter,	21
which	21
was	21
as	21
follows:	21
It	21
has	21
come	21
to	21
my	21
knowledge,	21
Señor	21
Don	21
Sancho	21
Panza,	21
that	21
certain	21
enemies	21
of	21
mine	21
and	21
of	21
the	21
island	21
are	21
about	21
to	21
make	21
a	21
furious	21
attack	21
upon	21
it	21
some	21
night,	21
I	21
know	21
not	21
when.	21
It	21
behoves	21
you	21
to	21
be	21
on	21
the	21
alert	21
and	21
keep	21
watch,	21
that	21
they	21
surprise	21
you	21
not.	21
I	21
also	21
know	21
by	21
trustworthy	21
spies	21
that	21
four	21
persons	21
have	21
entered	21
the	21
town	21
in	21
disguise	21
in	21
order	21
to	21
take	21
your	21
life,	21
because	21
they	21
stand	21
in	21
dread	21
of	21
your	21
great	21
capacity;	21
keep	21
your	21
eyes	21
open	21
and	21
take	21
heed	21
who	21
approaches	21
you	21
to	21
address	21
you,	21
and	21
eat	21
nothing	21
that	21
is	21
presented	21
to	21
you.	21
I	21
will	21
take	21
care	21
to	21
send	21
you	21
aid	21
if	21
you	21
find	21
yourself	21
in	21
difficulty,	21
but	21
in	21
all	21
things	21
you	21
will	21
act	21
as	21
may	21
be	21
expected	21
of	21
your	21
judgment.	21
From	21
this	21
place,	21
the	21
Sixteenth	21
of	21
August,	21
at	21
four	21
in	21
the	21
morning.	21
Your	21
friend,	21
THE	21
DUKE	21
Sancho	21
was	21
astonished,	21
and	21
those	21
who	21
stood	21
by	21
made	21
believe	21
to	21
be	21
so	21
too,	21
and	21
turning	21
to	21
the	21
majordomo	21
he	21
said	21
to	21
him,	21
“What	21
we	21
have	21
got	21
to	21
do	21
first,	21
and	21
it	21
must	21
be	21
done	21
at	21
once,	21
is	21
to	21
put	21
Doctor	21
Recio	21
in	21
the	21
lock-up;	21
for	21
if	21
anyone	21
wants	21
to	21
kill	21
me	21
it	21
is	21
he,	21
and	21
by	21
a	21
slow	21
death	21
and	21
the	21
worst	21
of	21
all,	21
which	21
is	21
hunger.”	21
“Likewise,”	21
said	21
the	21
carver,	21
“it	21
is	21
my	21
opinion	21
your	21
worship	21
should	21
not	21
eat	21
anything	21
that	21
is	21
on	21
this	21
table,	21
for	21
the	21
whole	21
was	21
a	21
present	21
from	21
some	21
nuns;	21
and	21
as	21
they	21
say,	21
‘behind	21
the	21
cross	21
there’s	21
the	21
devil.’”	21
“I	21
don’t	21
deny	21
it,”	21
said	21
Sancho;	21
“so	21
for	21
the	21
present	21
give	21
me	21
a	21
piece	21
of	21
bread	21
and	21
four	21
pounds	21
or	21
so	21
of	21
grapes;	21
no	21
poison	21
can	21
come	21
in	21
them;	21
for	21
the	21
fact	21
is	21
I	21
can’t	21
go	21
on	21
without	21
eating;	21
and	21
if	21
we	21
are	21
to	21
be	21
prepared	21
for	21
these	21
battles	21
that	21
are	21
threatening	21
us	21
we	21
must	21
be	21
well	21
provisioned;	21
for	21
it	21
is	21
the	21
tripes	21
that	21
carry	21
the	21
heart	21
and	21
not	21
the	21
heart	21
the	21
tripes.	21
And	21
you,	21
secretary,	21
answer	21
my	21
lord	21
the	21
duke	21
and	21
tell	21
him	21
that	21
all	21
his	21
commands	21
shall	21
be	21
obeyed	21
to	21
the	21
letter,	21
as	21
he	21
directs;	21
and	21
say	21
from	21
me	21
to	21
my	21
lady	21
the	21
duchess	21
that	21
I	21
kiss	21
her	21
hands,	21
and	21
that	21
I	21
beg	21
of	21
her	21
not	21
to	21
forget	21
to	21
send	21
my	21
letter	21
and	21
bundle	21
to	21
my	21
wife	21
Teresa	21
Panza	21
by	21
a	21
messenger;	21
and	21
I	21
will	21
take	21
it	21
as	21
a	21
great	21
favour	21
and	21
will	21
not	21
fail	21
to	21
serve	21
her	21
in	21
all	21
that	21
may	21
lie	21
within	21
my	21
power;	21
and	21
as	21
you	21
are	21
about	21
it	21
you	21
may	21
enclose	21
a	21
kiss	21
of	21
the	21
hand	21
to	21
my	21
master	21
Don	21
Quixote	21
that	21
he	21
may	21
see	21
I	21
am	21
grateful	21
bread;	21
and	21
as	21
a	21
good	21
secretary	21
and	21
a	21
good	21
Biscayan	21
you	21
may	21
add	21
whatever	21
you	21
like	21
and	21
whatever	21
will	21
come	21
in	21
best;	21
and	21
now	21
take	21
away	21
this	21
cloth	21
and	21
give	21
me	21
something	21
to	21
eat,	21
and	21
I’ll	21
be	21
ready	21
to	21
meet	21
all	21
the	21
spies	21
and	21
assassins	21
and	21
enchanters	21
that	21
may	21
come	21
against	21
me	21
or	21
my	21
island.”	21
At	21
this	21
instant	21
a	21
page	21
entered	21
saying,	21
“Here	21
is	21
a	21
farmer	21
on	21
business,	21
who	21
wants	21
to	21
speak	21
to	21
your	21
lordship	21
on	21
a	21
matter	21
of	21
great	21
importance,	21
he	21
says.”	21
“It’s	21
very	21
odd,”	21
said	21
Sancho,	21
“the	21
ways	21
of	21
these	21
men	21
on	21
business;	21
is	21
it	21
possible	21
they	21
can	21
be	21
such	21
fools	21
as	21
not	21
to	21
see	21
that	21
an	21
hour	21
like	21
this	21
is	21
no	21
hour	21
for	21
coming	21
on	21
business?	21
We	21
who	21
govern	21
and	21
we	21
who	21
are	21
judges—are	21
we	21
not	21
men	21
of	21
flesh	21
and	21
blood,	21
and	21
are	21
we	21
not	21
to	21
be	21
allowed	21
the	21
time	21
required	21
for	21
taking	21
rest,	21
unless	21
they’d	21
have	21
us	21
made	21
of	21
marble?	21
By	21
God	21
and	21
on	21
my	21
conscience,	21
if	21
the	21
government	21
remains	21
in	21
my	21
hands	21
(which	21
I	21
have	21
a	21
notion	21
it	21
won’t),	21
I’ll	21
bring	21
more	21
than	21
one	21
man	21
on	21
business	21
to	21
order.	21
However,	21
tell	21
this	21
good	21
man	21
to	21
come	21
in;	21
but	21
take	21
care	21
first	21
of	21
all	21
that	21
he	21
is	21
not	21
some	21
spy	21
or	21
one	21
of	21
my	21
assassins.”	21
“No,	21
my	21
lord,”	21
said	21
the	21
page,	21
“for	21
he	21
looks	21
like	21
a	21
simple	21
fellow,	21
and	21
either	21
I	21
know	21
very	21
little	21
or	21
he	21
is	21
as	21
good	21
as	21
good	21
bread.”	21
“There	21
is	21
nothing	21
to	21
be	21
afraid	21
of,”	21
said	21
the	21
majordomo,	21
“for	21
we	21
are	21
all	21
here.”	21
“Would	21
it	21
be	21
possible,	21
carver,”	21
said	21
Sancho,	21
“now	21
that	21
Doctor	21
Pedro	21
Recio	21
is	21
not	21
here,	21
to	21
let	21
me	21
eat	21
something	21
solid	21
and	21
substantial,	21
if	21
it	21
were	21
even	21
a	21
piece	21
of	21
bread	21
and	21
an	21
onion?”	21
“To-night	21
at	21
supper,”	21
said	21
the	21
carver,	21
“the	21
shortcomings	21
of	21
the	21
dinner	21
shall	21
be	21
made	21
good,	21
and	21
your	21
lordship	21
shall	21
be	21
fully	21
contented.”	21
“God	21
grant	21
it,”	21
said	21
Sancho.	21
The	21
farmer	21
now	21
came	21
in,	21
a	21
well-favoured	21
man	21
that	21
one	21
might	21
see	21
a	21
thousand	21
leagues	21
off	21
was	21
an	21
honest	21
fellow	21
and	21
a	21
good	21
soul.	21
The	21
first	21
thing	21
he	21
said	21
was,	21
“Which	21
is	21
the	21
lord	21
governor	21
here?”	21
“Which	21
should	21
it	21
be,”	21
said	21
the	21
secretary,	21
“but	21
he	21
who	21
is	21
seated	21
in	21
the	21
chair?”	21
“Then	21
I	21
humble	21
myself	21
before	21
him,”	21
said	21
the	21
farmer;	21
and	21
going	21
on	21
his	21
knees	21
he	21
asked	21
for	21
his	21
hand,	21
to	21
kiss	21
it.	21
Sancho	21
refused	21
it,	21
and	21
bade	21
him	21
stand	21
up	21
and	21
say	21
what	21
he	21
wanted.	21
The	21
farmer	21
obeyed,	21
and	21
then	21
said,	21
“I	21
am	21
a	21
farmer,	21
señor,	21
a	21
native	21
of	21
Miguelturra,	21
a	21
village	21
two	21
leagues	21
from	21
Ciudad	21
Real.”	21
“Another	21
Tirteafuera!”	21
said	21
Sancho;	21
“say	21
on,	21
brother;	21
I	21
know	21
Miguelturra	21
very	21
well	21
I	21
can	21
tell	21
you,	21
for	21
it’s	21
not	21
very	21
far	21
from	21
my	21
own	21
town.”	21
“The	21
case	21
is	21
this,	21
señor,”	21
continued	21
the	21
farmer,	21
“that	21
by	21
God’s	21
mercy	21
I	21
am	21
married	21
with	21
the	21
leave	21
and	21
licence	21
of	21
the	21
holy	21
Roman	21
Catholic	21
Church;	21
I	21
have	21
two	21
sons,	21
students,	21
and	21
the	21
younger	21
is	21
studying	21
to	21
become	21
bachelor,	21
and	21
the	21
elder	21
to	21
be	21
licentiate;	21
I	21
am	21
a	21
widower,	21
for	21
my	21
wife	21
died,	21
or	21
more	21
properly	21
speaking,	21
a	21
bad	21
doctor	21
killed	21
her	21
on	21
my	21
hands,	21
giving	21
her	21
a	21
purge	21
when	21
she	21
was	21
with	21
child;	21
and	21
if	21
it	21
had	21
pleased	21
God	21
that	21
the	21
child	21
had	21
been	21
born,	21
and	21
was	21
a	21
boy,	21
I	21
would	21
have	21
put	21
him	21
to	21
study	21
for	21
doctor,	21
that	21
he	21
might	21
not	21
envy	21
his	21
brothers	21
the	21
bachelor	21
and	21
the	21
licentiate.”	21
“So	21
that	21
if	21
your	21
wife	21
had	21
not	21
died,	21
or	21
had	21
not	21
been	21
killed,	21
you	21
would	21
not	21
now	21
be	21
a	21
widower,”	21
said	21
Sancho.	21
“No,	21
señor,	21
certainly	21
not,”	21
said	21
the	21
farmer.	21
“We’ve	21
got	21
that	21
much	21
settled,”	21
said	21
Sancho;	21
“get	21
on,	21
brother,	21
for	21
it’s	21
more	21
bed-time	21
than	21
business-time.”	21
“Well	21
then,”	21
said	21
the	21
farmer,	21
“this	21
son	21
of	21
mine	21
who	21
is	21
going	21
to	21
be	21
a	21
bachelor,	21
fell	21
in	21
love	21
in	21
the	21
said	21
town	21
with	21
a	21
damsel	21
called	21
Clara	21
Perlerina,	21
daughter	21
of	21
Andres	21
Perlerino,	21
a	21
very	21
rich	21
farmer;	21
and	21
this	21
name	21
of	21
Perlerines	21
does	21
not	21
come	21
to	21
them	21
by	21
ancestry	21
or	21
descent,	21
but	21
because	21
all	21
the	21
family	21
are	21
paralytics,	21
and	21
for	21
a	21
better	21
name	21
they	21
call	21
them	21
Perlerines;	21
though	21
to	21
tell	21
the	21
truth	21
the	21
damsel	21
is	21
as	21
fair	21
as	21
an	21
Oriental	21
pearl,	21
and	21
like	21
a	21
flower	21
of	21
the	21
field,	21
if	21
you	21
look	21
at	21
her	21
on	21
the	21
right	21
side;	21
on	21
the	21
left	21
not	21
so	21
much,	21
for	21
on	21
that	21
side	21
she	21
wants	21
an	21
eye	21
that	21
she	21
lost	21
by	21
small-pox;	21
and	21
though	21
her	21
face	21
is	21
thickly	21
and	21
deeply	21
pitted,	21
those	21
who	21
love	21
her	21
say	21
they	21
are	21
not	21
pits	21
that	21
are	21
there,	21
but	21
the	21
graves	21
where	21
the	21
hearts	21
of	21
her	21
lovers	21
are	21
buried.	21
She	21
is	21
so	21
cleanly	21
that	21
not	21
to	21
soil	21
her	21
face	21
she	21
carries	21
her	21
nose	21
turned	21
up,	21
as	21
they	21
say,	21
so	21
that	21
one	21
would	21
fancy	21
it	21
was	21
running	21
away	21
from	21
her	21
mouth;	21
and	21
with	21
all	21
this	21
she	21
looks	21
extremely	21
well,	21
for	21
she	21
has	21
a	21
wide	21
mouth;	21
and	21
but	21
for	21
wanting	21
ten	21
or	21
a	21
dozen	21
teeth	21
and	21
grinders	21
she	21
might	21
compare	21
and	21
compete	21
with	21
the	21
comeliest.	21
Of	21
her	21
lips	21
I	21
say	21
nothing,	21
for	21
they	21
are	21
so	21
fine	21
and	21
thin	21
that,	21
if	21
lips	21
might	21
be	21
reeled,	21
one	21
might	21
make	21
a	21
skein	21
of	21
them;	21
but	21
being	21
of	21
a	21
different	21
colour	21
from	21
ordinary	21
lips	21
they	21
are	21
wonderful,	21
for	21
they	21
are	21
mottled,	21
blue,	21
green,	21
and	21
purple—let	21
my	21
lord	21
the	21
governor	21
pardon	21
me	21
for	21
painting	21
so	21
minutely	21
the	21
charms	21
of	21
her	21
who	21
some	21
time	21
or	21
other	21
will	21
be	21
my	21
daughter;	21
for	21
I	21
love	21
her,	21
and	21
I	21
don’t	21
find	21
her	21
amiss.”	21
“Paint	21
what	21
you	21
will,”	21
said	21
Sancho;	21
“I	21
enjoy	21
your	21
painting,	21
and	21
if	21
I	21
had	21
dined	21
there	21
could	21
be	21
no	21
dessert	21
more	21
to	21
my	21
taste	21
than	21
your	21
portrait.”	21
“That	21
I	21
have	21
still	21
to	21
furnish,”	21
said	21
the	21
farmer;	21
“but	21
a	21
time	21
will	21
come	21
when	21
we	21
may	21
be	21
able	21
if	21
we	21
are	21
not	21
now;	21
and	21
I	21
can	21
tell	21
you,	21
señor,	21
if	21
I	21
could	21
paint	21
her	21
gracefulness	21
and	21
her	21
tall	21
figure,	21
it	21
would	21
astonish	21
you;	21
but	21
that	21
is	21
impossible	21
because	21
she	21
is	21
bent	21
double	21
with	21
her	21
knees	21
up	21
to	21
her	21
mouth;	21
but	21
for	21
all	21
that	21
it	21
is	21
easy	21
to	21
see	21
that	21
if	21
she	21
could	21
stand	21
up	21
she’d	21
knock	21
her	21
head	21
against	21
the	21
ceiling;	21
and	21
she	21
would	21
have	21
given	21
her	21
hand	21
to	21
my	21
bachelor	21
ere	21
this,	21
only	21
that	21
she	21
can’t	21
stretch	21
it	21
out,	21
for	21
it’s	21
contracted;	21
but	21
still	21
one	21
can	21
see	21
its	21
elegance	21
and	21
fine	21
make	21
by	21
its	21
long	21
furrowed	21
nails.”	21
“That	21
will	21
do,	21
brother,”	21
said	21
Sancho;	21
“consider	21
you	21
have	21
painted	21
her	21
from	21
head	21
to	21
foot;	21
what	21
is	21
it	21
you	21
want	21
now?	21
Come	21
to	21
the	21
point	21
without	21
all	21
this	21
beating	21
about	21
the	21
bush,	21
and	21
all	21
these	21
scraps	21
and	21
additions.”	21
“I	21
want	21
your	21
worship,	21
señor,”	21
said	21
the	21
farmer,	21
“to	21
do	21
me	21
the	21
favour	21
of	21
giving	21
me	21
a	21
letter	21
of	21
recommendation	21
to	21
the	21
girl’s	21
father,	21
begging	21
him	21
to	21
be	21
so	21
good	21
as	21
to	21
let	21
this	21
marriage	21
take	21
place,	21
as	21
we	21
are	21
not	21
ill-matched	21
either	21
in	21
the	21
gifts	21
of	21
fortune	21
or	21
of	21
nature;	21
for	21
to	21
tell	21
the	21
truth,	21
señor	21
governor,	21
my	21
son	21
is	21
possessed	21
of	21
a	21
devil,	21
and	21
there	21
is	21
not	21
a	21
day	21
but	21
the	21
evil	21
spirits	21
torment	21
him	21
three	21
or	21
four	21
times;	21
and	21
from	21
having	21
once	21
fallen	21
into	21
the	21
fire,	21
he	21
has	21
his	21
face	21
puckered	21
up	21
like	21
a	21
piece	21
of	21
parchment,	21
and	21
his	21
eyes	21
watery	21
and	21
always	21
running;	21
but	21
he	21
has	21
the	21
disposition	21
of	21
an	21
angel,	21
and	21
if	21
it	21
was	21
not	21
for	21
belabouring	21
and	21
pummelling	21
himself	21
he’d	21
be	21
a	21
saint.”	21
“Is	21
there	21
anything	21
else	21
you	21
want,	21
good	21
man?”	21
said	21
Sancho.	21
“There’s	21
another	21
thing	21
I’d	21
like,”	21
said	21
the	21
farmer,	21
“but	21
I’m	21
afraid	21
to	21
mention	21
it;	21
however,	21
out	21
it	21
must;	21
for	21
after	21
all	21
I	21
can’t	21
let	21
it	21
be	21
rotting	21
in	21
my	21
breast,	21
come	21
what	21
may.	21
I	21
mean,	21
señor,	21
that	21
I’d	21
like	21
your	21
worship	21
to	21
give	21
me	21
three	21
hundred	21
or	21
six	21
hundred	21
ducats	21
as	21
a	21
help	21
to	21
my	21
bachelor’s	21
portion,	21
to	21
help	21
him	21
in	21
setting	21
up	21
house;	21
for	21
they	21
must,	21
in	21
short,	21
live	21
by	21
themselves,	21
without	21
being	21
subject	21
to	21
the	21
interferences	21
of	21
their	21
fathers-in-law.”	21
“Just	21
see	21
if	21
there’s	21
anything	21
else	21
you’d	21
like,”	21
said	21
Sancho,	21
“and	21
don’t	21
hold	21
back	21
from	21
mentioning	21
it	21
out	21
of	21
bashfulness	21
or	21
modesty.”	21
“No,	21
indeed	21
there	21
is	21
not,”	21
said	21
the	21
farmer.	21
The	21
moment	21
he	21
said	21
this	21
the	21
governor	21
started	21
to	21
his	21
feet,	21
and	21
seizing	21
the	21
chair	21
he	21
had	21
been	21
sitting	21
on	21
exclaimed,	21
“By	21
all	21
that’s	21
good,	21
you	21
ill-bred,	21
boorish	21
Don	21
Bumpkin,	21
if	21
you	21
don’t	21
get	21
out	21
of	21
this	21
at	21
once	21
and	21
hide	21
yourself	21
from	21
my	21
sight,	21
I’ll	21
lay	21
your	21
head	21
open	21
with	21
this	21
chair.	21
You	21
whoreson	21
rascal,	21
you	21
devil’s	21
own	21
painter,	21
and	21
is	21
it	21
at	21
this	21
hour	21
you	21
come	21
to	21
ask	21
me	21
for	21
six	21
hundred	21
ducats!	21
How	21
should	21
I	21
have	21
them,	21
you	21
stinking	21
brute?	21
And	21
why	21
should	21
I	21
give	21
them	21
to	21
you	21
if	21
I	21
had	21
them,	21
you	21
knave	21
and	21
blockhead?	21
What	21
have	21
I	21
to	21
do	21
with	21
Miguelturra	21
or	21
the	21
whole	21
family	21
of	21
the	21
Perlerines?	21
Get	21
out	21
I	21
say,	21
or	21
by	21
the	21
life	21
of	21
my	21
lord	21
the	21
duke	21
I’ll	21
do	21
as	21
I	21
said.	21
You’re	21
not	21
from	21
Miguelturra,	21
but	21
some	21
knave	21
sent	21
here	21
from	21
hell	21
to	21
tempt	21
me.	21
Why,	21
you	21
villain,	21
I	21
have	21
not	21
yet	21
had	21
the	21
government	21
half	21
a	21
day,	21
and	21
you	21
want	21
me	21
to	21
have	21
six	21
hundred	21
ducats	21
already!”	21
The	21
carver	21
made	21
signs	21
to	21
the	21
farmer	21
to	21
leave	21
the	21
room,	21
which	21
he	21
did	21
with	21
his	21
head	21
down,	21
and	21
to	21
all	21
appearance	21
in	21
terror	21
lest	21
the	21
governor	21
should	21
carry	21
his	21
threats	21
into	21
effect,	21
for	21
the	21
rogue	21
knew	21
very	21
well	21
how	21
to	21
play	21
his	21
part.	21
But	21
let	21
us	21
leave	21
Sancho	21
in	21
his	21
wrath,	21
and	21
peace	21
be	21
with	21
them	21
all;	21
and	21
let	21
us	21
return	21
to	21
Don	21
Quixote,	21
whom	21
we	21
left	21
with	21
his	21
face	21
bandaged	21
and	21
doctored	21
after	21
the	21
cat	21
wounds,	21
of	21
which	21
he	21
was	21
not	21
cured	21
for	21
eight	21
days;	21
and	21
on	21
one	21
of	21
these	21
there	21
befell	21
him	21
what	21
Cide	21
Hamete	21
promises	21
to	21
relate	21
with	21
that	21
exactitude	21
and	21
truth	21
with	21
which	21
he	21
is	21
wont	21
to	21
set	21
forth	21
everything	21
connected	21
with	21
this	21
great	21
history,	21
however	21
minute	21
it	21
may	21
be.	21

Exceedingly	21
moody	21
and	21
dejected	21
was	21
the	21
sorely	21
wounded	21
Don	21
Quixote,	21
with	21
his	21
face	21
bandaged	21
and	21
marked,	21
not	21
by	21
the	21

Six	21
days	21
he	21
remained	21
without	21
appearing	21
in	21
public,	21
and	21
one	21
night	21
as	21
he	21
lay	21
awake	21
thinking	21
of	21
his	21
misfortunes	21
and	21
of	21
Altisidora’s	21
pursuit	21
of	21
him,	21
he	21
perceived	21
that	21
someone	21
was	21
opening	21
the	21
door	21
of	21
his	21
room	21
with	21
a	21
key,	21
and	21
he	21
at	21
once	21
made	21
up	21
his	21
mind	21
that	21
the	21
enamoured	21
damsel	21
was	21
coming	21
to	21
make	21
an	21
assault	21
upon	21
his	21
chastity	21
and	21
put	21
him	21
in	21
danger	21
of	21
failing	21
in	21
the	21
fidelity	21
he	21
owed	21
to	21
his	21
lady	21
Dulcinea	21
del	21
Toboso.	21
“No,”	21
said	21
he,	21
firmly	21
persuaded	21
of	21
the	21
truth	21
of	21
his	21
idea	21
(and	21
he	21
said	21
it	21
loud	21
enough	21
to	21
be	21
heard),	21
“the	21
greatest	21
beauty	21
upon	21
earth	21
shall	21
not	21
avail	21
to	21
make	21
me	21
renounce	21
my	21
adoration	21
of	21
her	21
whom	21
I	21
bear	21
stamped	21
and	21
graved	21
in	21
the	21
core	21
of	21
my	21
heart	21
and	21
the	21
secret	21
depths	21
of	21
my	21
bowels;	21
be	21
thou,	21
lady	21
mine,	21
transformed	21
into	21
a	21
clumsy	21
country	21
wench,	21
or	21
into	21
a	21
nymph	21
of	21
golden	21
Tagus	21
weaving	21
a	21
web	21
of	21
silk	21
and	21
gold,	21
let	21
Merlin	21
or	21
Montesinos	21
hold	21
thee	21
captive	21
where	21
they	21
will;	21
where’er	21
thou	21
art,	21
thou	21
art	21
mine,	21
and	21
where’er	21
I	21
am,	21
must	21
be	21
thine.”	21
The	21
very	21
instant	21
he	21
had	21
uttered	21
these	21
words,	21
the	21
door	21
opened.	21
He	21
stood	21
up	21
on	21
the	21
bed	21
wrapped	21
from	21
head	21
to	21
foot	21
in	21
a	21
yellow	21
satin	21
coverlet,	21
with	21
a	21
cap	21
on	21
his	21
head,	21
and	21
his	21
face	21
and	21
his	21
moustaches	21
tied	21
up,	21
his	21
face	21
because	21
of	21
the	21
scratches,	21
and	21
his	21
moustaches	21
to	21
keep	21
them	21
from	21
drooping	21
and	21
falling	21
down,	21
in	21
which	21
trim	21
he	21
looked	21
the	21
most	21
extraordinary	21
scarecrow	21
that	21
could	21
be	21
conceived.	21
He	21
kept	21
his	21
eyes	21
fixed	21
on	21
the	21
door,	21
and	21
just	21
as	21
he	21
was	21
expecting	21
to	21
see	21
the	21
love-smitten	21
and	21
unhappy	21
Altisidora	21
make	21
her	21
appearance,	21
he	21
saw	21
coming	21
in	21
a	21
most	21
venerable	21
duenna,	21
in	21
a	21
long	21
white-bordered	21
veil	21
that	21
covered	21
and	21
enveloped	21
her	21
from	21
head	21
to	21
foot.	21
Between	21
the	21
fingers	21
of	21
her	21
left	21
hand	21
she	21
held	21
a	21
short	21
lighted	21
candle,	21
while	21
with	21
her	21
right	21
she	21
shaded	21
it	21
to	21
keep	21
the	21
light	21
from	21
her	21
eyes,	21
which	21
were	21
covered	21
by	21
spectacles	21
of	21
great	21
size,	21
and	21
she	21
advanced	21
with	21
noiseless	21
steps,	21
treading	21
very	21
softly.	21
Don	21
Quixote	21
kept	21
an	21
eye	21
upon	21
her	21
from	21
his	21
watchtower,	21
and	21
observing	21
her	21
costume	21
and	21
noting	21
her	21
silence,	21
he	21
concluded	21
that	21
it	21
must	21
be	21
some	21
witch	21
or	21
sorceress	21
that	21
was	21
coming	21
in	21
such	21
a	21
guise	21
to	21
work	21
him	21
some	21
mischief,	21
and	21
he	21
began	21
crossing	21
himself	21
at	21
a	21
great	21
rate.	21
The	21
spectre	21
still	21
advanced,	21
and	21
on	21
reaching	21
the	21
middle	21
of	21
the	21
room,	21
looked	21
up	21
and	21
saw	21
the	21
energy	21
with	21
which	21
Don	21
Quixote	21
was	21
crossing	21
himself;	21
and	21
if	21
he	21
was	21
scared	21
by	21
seeing	21
such	21
a	21
figure	21
as	21
hers,	21
she	21
was	21
terrified	21
at	21
the	21
sight	21
of	21
his;	21
for	21
the	21
moment	21
she	21
saw	21
his	21
tall	21
yellow	21
form	21
with	21
the	21
coverlet	21
and	21
the	21
bandages	21
that	21
disfigured	21
him,	21
she	21
gave	21
a	21
loud	21
scream,	21
and	21
exclaiming,	21
“Jesus!	21
what’s	21
this	21
I	21
see?”	21
let	21
fall	21
the	21
candle	21
in	21
her	21
fright,	21
and	21
then	21
finding	21
herself	21
in	21
the	21
dark,	21
turned	21
about	21
to	21
make	21
off,	21
but	21
stumbling	21
on	21
her	21
skirts	21
in	21
her	21
consternation,	21
she	21
measured	21
her	21
length	21
with	21
a	21
mighty	21
fall.	21

Don	21
Quixote	21
in	21
his	21
trepidation	21
began	21
saying,	21
“I	21
conjure	21
thee,	21
phantom,	21
or	21
whatever	21
thou	21
art,	21
tell	21
me	21
what	21
thou	21
art	21
and	21
what	21
thou	21
wouldst	21
with	21
me.	21
If	21
thou	21
art	21
a	21
soul	21
in	21
torment,	21
say	21
so,	21
and	21
all	21
that	21
my	21
powers	21
can	21
do	21
I	21
will	21
do	21
for	21
thee;	21
for	21
I	21
am	21
a	21
Catholic	21
Christian	21
and	21
love	21
to	21
do	21
good	21
to	21
all	21
the	21
world,	21
and	21
to	21
this	21
end	21
I	21
have	21
embraced	21
the	21
order	21
of	21
knight-errantry	21
to	21
which	21
I	21
belong,	21
the	21
province	21
of	21
which	21
extends	21
to	21
doing	21
good	21
even	21
to	21
souls	21
in	21
purgatory.”	21
The	21
unfortunate	21
duenna	21
hearing	21
herself	21
thus	21
conjured,	21
by	21
her	21
own	21
fear	21
guessed	21
Don	21
Quixote’s	21
and	21
in	21
a	21
low	21
plaintive	21
voice	21
answered,	21
“Señor	21
Don	21
Quixote—if	21
so	21
be	21
you	21
are	21
indeed	21
Don	21
Quixote—I	21
am	21
no	21
phantom	21
or	21
spectre	21
or	21
soul	21
in	21
purgatory,	21
as	21
you	21
seem	21
to	21
think,	21
but	21
Doña	21
Rodriguez,	21
duenna	21
of	21
honour	21
to	21
my	21
lady	21
the	21
duchess,	21
and	21
I	21
come	21
to	21
you	21
with	21
one	21
of	21
those	21
grievances	21
your	21
worship	21
is	21
wont	21
to	21
redress.”	21
“Tell	21
me,	21
Señora	21
Doña	21
Rodriguez,”	21
said	21
Don	21
Quixote,	21
“do	21
you	21
perchance	21
come	21
to	21
transact	21
any	21
go-between	21
business?	21
Because	21
I	21
must	21
tell	21
you	21
I	21
am	21
not	21
available	21
for	21
anybody’s	21
purpose,	21
thanks	21
to	21
the	21
peerless	21
beauty	21
of	21
my	21
lady	21
Dulcinea	21
del	21
Toboso.	21
In	21
short,	21
Señora	21
Doña	21
Rodriguez,	21
if	21
you	21
will	21
leave	21
out	21
and	21
put	21
aside	21
all	21
love	21
messages,	21
you	21
may	21
go	21
and	21
light	21
your	21
candle	21
and	21
come	21
back,	21
and	21
we	21
will	21
discuss	21
all	21
the	21
commands	21
you	21
have	21
for	21
me	21
and	21
whatever	21
you	21
wish,	21
saving	21
only,	21
as	21
I	21
said,	21
all	21
seductive	21
communications.”	21
“I	21
carry	21
nobody’s	21
messages,	21
señor,”	21
said	21
the	21
duenna;	21
“little	21
you	21
know	21
me.	21
Nay,	21
I’m	21
not	21
far	21
enough	21
advanced	21
in	21
years	21
to	21
take	21
to	21
any	21
such	21
childish	21
tricks.	21
God	21
be	21
praised	21
I	21
have	21
a	21
soul	21
in	21
my	21
body	21
still,	21
and	21
all	21
my	21
teeth	21
and	21
grinders	21
in	21
my	21
mouth,	21
except	21
one	21
or	21
two	21
that	21
the	21
colds,	21
so	21
common	21
in	21
this	21
Aragon	21
country,	21
have	21
robbed	21
me	21
of.	21
But	21
wait	21
a	21
little,	21
while	21
I	21
go	21
and	21
light	21
my	21
candle,	21
and	21
I	21
will	21
return	21
immediately	21
and	21
lay	21
my	21
sorrows	21
before	21
you	21
as	21
before	21
one	21
who	21
relieves	21
those	21
of	21
all	21
the	21
world;”	21
and	21
without	21
staying	21
for	21
an	21
answer	21
she	21
quitted	21
the	21
room	21
and	21
left	21
Don	21
Quixote	21
tranquilly	21
meditating	21
while	21
he	21
waited	21
for	21
her.	21
A	21
thousand	21
thoughts	21
at	21
once	21
suggested	21
themselves	21
to	21
him	21
on	21
the	21
subject	21
of	21
this	21
new	21
adventure,	21
and	21
it	21
struck	21
him	21
as	21
being	21
ill	21
done	21
and	21
worse	21
advised	21
in	21
him	21
to	21
expose	21
himself	21
to	21
the	21
danger	21
of	21
breaking	21
his	21
plighted	21
faith	21
to	21
his	21
lady;	21
and	21
said	21
he	21
to	21
himself,	21
“Who	21
knows	21
but	21
that	21
the	21
devil,	21
being	21
wily	21
and	21
cunning,	21
may	21
be	21
trying	21
now	21
to	21
entrap	21
me	21
with	21
a	21
duenna,	21
having	21
failed	21
with	21
empresses,	21
queens,	21
duchesses,	21
marchionesses,	21
and	21
countesses?	21
Many	21
a	21
time	21
have	21
I	21
heard	21
it	21
said	21
by	21
many	21
a	21
man	21
of	21
sense	21
that	21
he	21
will	21
sooner	21
offer	21
you	21
a	21
flat-nosed	21
wench	21
than	21
a	21
roman-nosed	21
one;	21
and	21
who	21
knows	21
but	21
this	21
privacy,	21
this	21
opportunity,	21
this	21
silence,	21
may	21
awaken	21
my	21
sleeping	21
desires,	21
and	21
lead	21
me	21
in	21
these	21
my	21
latter	21
years	21
to	21
fall	21
where	21
I	21
have	21
never	21
tripped?	21
In	21
cases	21
of	21
this	21
sort	21
it	21
is	21
better	21
to	21
flee	21
than	21
to	21
await	21
the	21
battle.	21
But	21
I	21
must	21
be	21
out	21
of	21
my	21
senses	21
to	21
think	21
and	21
utter	21
such	21
nonsense;	21
for	21
it	21
is	21
impossible	21
that	21
a	21
long,	21
white-hooded	21
spectacled	21
duenna	21
could	21
stir	21
up	21
or	21
excite	21
a	21
wanton	21
thought	21
in	21
the	21
most	21
graceless	21
bosom	21
in	21
the	21
world.	21
Is	21
there	21
a	21
duenna	21
on	21
earth	21
that	21
has	21
fair	21
flesh?	21
Is	21
there	21
a	21
duenna	21
in	21
the	21
world	21
that	21
escapes	21
being	21
ill-tempered,	21
wrinkled,	21
and	21
prudish?	21
Avaunt,	21
then,	21
ye	21
duenna	21
crew,	21
undelightful	21
to	21
all	21
mankind.	21
Oh,	21
but	21
that	21
lady	21
did	21
well	21
who,	21
they	21
say,	21
had	21
at	21
the	21
end	21
of	21
her	21
reception	21
room	21
a	21
couple	21
of	21
figures	21
of	21
duennas	21
with	21
spectacles	21
and	21
lace-cushions,	21
as	21
if	21
at	21
work,	21
and	21
those	21
statues	21
served	21
quite	21
as	21
well	21
to	21
give	21
an	21
air	21
of	21
propriety	21
to	21
the	21
room	21
as	21
if	21
they	21
had	21
been	21
real	21
duennas.”	21
So	21
saying	21
he	21
leaped	21
off	21
the	21
bed,	21
intending	21
to	21
close	21
the	21
door	21
and	21
not	21
allow	21
Señora	21
Rodriguez	21
to	21
enter;	21
but	21
as	21
he	21
went	21
to	21
shut	21
it	21
Señora	21
Rodriguez	21
returned	21
with	21
a	21
wax	21
candle	21
lighted,	21
and	21
having	21
a	21
closer	21
view	21
of	21
Don	21
Quixote,	21
with	21
the	21
coverlet	21
round	21
him,	21
and	21
his	21
bandages	21
and	21
night-cap,	21
she	21
was	21
alarmed	21
afresh,	21
and	21
retreating	21
a	21
couple	21
of	21
paces,	21
exclaimed,	21
“Am	21
I	21
safe,	21
sir	21
knight?	21
for	21
I	21
don’t	21
look	21
upon	21
it	21
as	21
a	21
sign	21
of	21
very	21
great	21
virtue	21
that	21
your	21
worship	21
should	21
have	21
got	21
up	21
out	21
of	21
bed.”	21
“I	21
may	21
well	21
ask	21
the	21
same,	21
señora,”	21
said	21
Don	21
Quixote;	21
“and	21
I	21
do	21
ask	21
whether	21
I	21
shall	21
be	21
safe	21
from	21
being	21
assailed	21
and	21
forced?”	21
“Of	21
whom	21
and	21
against	21
whom	21
do	21
you	21
demand	21
that	21
security,	21
sir	21
knight?”	21
said	21
the	21
duenna.	21
“Of	21
you	21
and	21
against	21
you	21
I	21
ask	21
it,”	21
said	21
Don	21
Quixote;	21
“for	21
I	21
am	21
not	21
marble,	21
nor	21
are	21
you	21
brass,	21
nor	21
is	21
it	21
now	21
ten	21
o’clock	21
in	21
the	21
morning,	21
but	21
midnight,	21
or	21
a	21
trifle	21
past	21
it	21
I	21
fancy,	21
and	21
we	21
are	21
in	21
a	21
room	21
more	21
secluded	21
and	21
retired	21
than	21
the	21
cave	21
could	21
have	21
been	21
where	21
the	21
treacherous	21
and	21
daring	21
Æneas	21
enjoyed	21
the	21
fair	21
soft-hearted	21
Dido.	21
But	21
give	21
me	21
your	21
hand,	21
señora;	21
I	21
require	21
no	21
better	21
protection	21
than	21
my	21
own	21
continence,	21
and	21
my	21
own	21
sense	21
of	21
propriety;	21
as	21
well	21
as	21
that	21
which	21
is	21
inspired	21
by	21
that	21
venerable	21
head-dress;”	21
and	21
so	21
saying	21
he	21
kissed	21
her	21
right	21
hand	21
and	21
took	21
it	21
in	21
his	21
own,	21
she	21
yielding	21
it	21
to	21
him	21
with	21
equal	21
ceremoniousness.	21
And	21
here	21
Cide	21
Hamete	21
inserts	21
a	21
parenthesis	21
in	21
which	21
he	21
says	21
that	21
to	21
have	21
seen	21
the	21
pair	21
marching	21
from	21
the	21
door	21
to	21
the	21
bed,	21
linked	21
hand	21
in	21
hand	21
in	21
this	21
way,	21
he	21
would	21
have	21
given	21
the	21
best	21
of	21
the	21
two	21
tunics	21
he	21
had.	21
Don	21
Quixote	21
finally	21
got	21
into	21
bed,	21
and	21
Doña	21
Rodriguez	21
took	21
her	21
seat	21
on	21
a	21
chair	21
at	21
some	21
little	21
distance	21
from	21
his	21
couch,	21
without	21
taking	21
off	21
her	21
spectacles	21
or	21
putting	21
aside	21
the	21
candle.	21
Don	21
Quixote	21
wrapped	21
the	21
bedclothes	21
round	21
him	21
and	21
covered	21
himself	21
up	21
completely,	21
leaving	21
nothing	21
but	21
his	21
face	21
visible,	21
and	21
as	21
soon	21
as	21
they	21
had	21
both	21
regained	21
their	21
composure	21
he	21
broke	21
silence,	21
saying,	21
“Now,	21
Señora	21
Doña	21
Rodriguez,	21
you	21
may	21
unbosom	21
yourself	21
and	21
out	21
with	21
everything	21
you	21
have	21
in	21
your	21
sorrowful	21
heart	21
and	21
afflicted	21
bowels;	21
and	21
by	21
me	21
you	21
shall	21
be	21
listened	21
to	21
with	21
chaste	21
ears,	21
and	21
aided	21
by	21
compassionate	21
exertions.”	21
“I	21
believe	21
it,”	21
replied	21
the	21
duenna;	21
“from	21
your	21
worship’s	21
gentle	21
and	21
winning	21
presence	21
only	21
such	21
a	21
Christian	21
answer	21
could	21
be	21
expected.	21
The	21
fact	21
is,	21
then,	21
Señor	21
Don	21
Quixote,	21
that	21
though	21
you	21
see	21
me	21
seated	21
in	21
this	21
chair,	21
here	21
in	21
the	21
middle	21
of	21
the	21
kingdom	21
of	21
Aragon,	21
and	21
in	21
the	21
attire	21
of	21
a	21
despised	21
outcast	21
duenna,	21
I	21
am	21
from	21
the	21
Asturias	21
of	21
Oviedo,	21
and	21
of	21
a	21
family	21
with	21
which	21
many	21
of	21
the	21
best	21
of	21
the	21
province	21
are	21
connected	21
by	21
blood;	21
but	21
my	21
untoward	21
fate	21
and	21
the	21
improvidence	21
of	21
my	21
parents,	21
who,	21
I	21
know	21
not	21
how,	21
were	21
unseasonably	21
reduced	21
to	21
poverty,	21
brought	21
me	21
to	21
the	21
court	21
of	21
Madrid,	21
where	21
as	21
a	21
provision	21
and	21
to	21
avoid	21
greater	21
misfortunes,	21
my	21
parents	21
placed	21
me	21
as	21
seamstress	21
in	21
the	21
service	21
of	21
a	21
lady	21
of	21
quality,	21
and	21
I	21
would	21
have	21
you	21
know	21
that	21
for	21
hemming	21
and	21
sewing	21
I	21
have	21
never	21
been	21
surpassed	21
by	21
any	21
all	21
my	21
life.	21
My	21
parents	21
left	21
me	21
in	21
service	21
and	21
returned	21
to	21
their	21
own	21
country,	21
and	21
a	21
few	21
years	21
later	21
went,	21
no	21
doubt,	21
to	21
heaven,	21
for	21
they	21
were	21
excellent	21
good	21
Catholic	21
Christians.	21
I	21
was	21
left	21
an	21
orphan	21
with	21
nothing	21
but	21
the	21
miserable	21
wages	21
and	21
trifling	21
presents	21
that	21
are	21
given	21
to	21
servants	21
of	21
my	21
sort	21
in	21
palaces;	21
but	21
about	21
this	21
time,	21
without	21
any	21
encouragement	21
on	21
my	21
part,	21
one	21
of	21
the	21
esquires	21
of	21
the	21
household	21
fell	21
in	21
love	21
with	21
me,	21
a	21
man	21
somewhat	21
advanced	21
in	21
years,	21
full-bearded	21
and	21
personable,	21
and	21
above	21
all	21
as	21
good	21
a	21
gentleman	21
as	21
the	21
king	21
himself,	21
for	21
he	21
came	21
of	21
a	21
mountain	21
stock.	21
We	21
did	21
not	21
carry	21
on	21
our	21
loves	21
with	21
such	21
secrecy	21
but	21
that	21
they	21
came	21
to	21
the	21
knowledge	21
of	21
my	21
lady,	21
and	21
she,	21
not	21
to	21
have	21
any	21
fuss	21
about	21
it,	21
had	21
us	21
married	21
with	21
the	21
full	21
sanction	21
of	21
the	21
holy	21
mother	21
Roman	21
Catholic	21
Church,	21
of	21
which	21
marriage	21
a	21
daughter	21
was	21
born	21
to	21
put	21
an	21
end	21
to	21
my	21
good	21
fortune,	21
if	21
I	21
had	21
any;	21
not	21
that	21
I	21
died	21
in	21
childbirth,	21
for	21
I	21
passed	21
through	21
it	21
safely	21
and	21
in	21
due	21
season,	21
but	21
because	21
shortly	21
afterwards	21
my	21
husband	21
died	21
of	21
a	21
certain	21
shock	21
he	21
received,	21
and	21
had	21
I	21
time	21
to	21
tell	21
you	21
of	21
it	21
I	21
know	21
your	21
worship	21
would	21
be	21
surprised;”	21
and	21
here	21
she	21
began	21
to	21
weep	21
bitterly	21
and	21
said,	21
“Pardon	21
me,	21
Señor	21
Don	21
Quixote,	21
if	21
I	21
am	21
unable	21
to	21
control	21
myself,	21
for	21
every	21
time	21
I	21
think	21
of	21
my	21
unfortunate	21
husband	21
my	21
eyes	21
fill	21
up	21
with	21
tears.	21
God	21
bless	21
me,	21
with	21
what	21
an	21
air	21
of	21
dignity	21
he	21
used	21
to	21
carry	21
my	21
lady	21
behind	21
him	21
on	21
a	21
stout	21
mule	21
as	21
black	21
as	21
jet!	21
for	21
in	21
those	21
days	21
they	21
did	21
not	21
use	21
coaches	21
or	21
chairs,	21
as	21
they	21
say	21
they	21
do	21
now,	21
and	21
ladies	21
rode	21
behind	21
their	21
squires.	21
This	21
much	21
at	21
least	21
I	21
cannot	21
help	21
telling	21
you,	21
that	21
you	21
may	21
observe	21
the	21
good	21
breeding	21
and	21
punctiliousness	21
of	21
my	21
worthy	21
husband.	21
As	21
he	21
was	21
turning	21
into	21
the	21
Calle	21
de	21
Santiago	21
in	21
Madrid,	21
which	21
is	21
rather	21
narrow,	21
one	21
of	21
the	21
alcaldes	21
of	21
the	21
Court,	21
with	21
two	21
alguacils	21
before	21
him,	21
was	21
coming	21
out	21
of	21
it,	21
and	21
as	21
soon	21
as	21
my	21
good	21
squire	21
saw	21
him	21
he	21
wheeled	21
his	21
mule	21
about	21
and	21
made	21
as	21
if	21
he	21
would	21
turn	21
and	21
accompany	21
him.	21
My	21
lady,	21
who	21
was	21
riding	21
behind	21
him,	21
said	21
to	21
him	21
in	21
a	21
low	21
voice,	21
‘What	21
are	21
you	21
about,	21
you	21
sneak,	21
don’t	21
you	21
see	21
that	21
I	21
am	21
here?’	21
The	21
alcalde	21
like	21
a	21
polite	21
man	21
pulled	21
up	21
his	21
horse	21
and	21
said	21
to	21
him,	21
‘Proceed,	21
señor,	21
for	21
it	21
is	21
I,	21
rather,	21
who	21
ought	21
to	21
accompany	21
my	21
lady	21
Doña	21
Casilda’—for	21
that	21
was	21
my	21
mistress’s	21
name.	21
Still	21
my	21
husband,	21
cap	21
in	21
hand,	21
persisted	21
in	21
trying	21
to	21
accompany	21
the	21
alcalde,	21
and	21
seeing	21
this	21
my	21
lady,	21
filled	21
with	21
rage	21
and	21
vexation,	21
pulled	21
out	21
a	21
big	21
pin,	21
or,	21
I	21
rather	21
think,	21
a	21
bodkin,	21
out	21
of	21
her	21
needle-case	21
and	21
drove	21
it	21
into	21
his	21
back	21
with	21
such	21
force	21
that	21
my	21
husband	21
gave	21
a	21
loud	21
yell,	21
and	21
writhing	21
fell	21
to	21
the	21
ground	21
with	21
his	21
lady.	21
Her	21
two	21
lacqueys	21
ran	21
to	21
rise	21
her	21
up,	21
and	21
the	21
alcalde	21
and	21
the	21
alguacils	21
did	21
the	21
same;	21
the	21
Guadalajara	21
gate	21
was	21
all	21
in	21
commotion—I	21
mean	21
the	21
idlers	21
congregated	21
there;	21
my	21
mistress	21
came	21
back	21
on	21
foot,	21
and	21
my	21
husband	21
hurried	21
away	21
to	21
a	21
barber’s	21
shop	21
protesting	21
that	21
he	21
was	21
run	21
right	21
through	21
the	21
guts.	21
The	21
courtesy	21
of	21
my	21
husband	21
was	21
noised	21
abroad	21
to	21
such	21
an	21
extent,	21
that	21
the	21
boys	21
gave	21
him	21
no	21
peace	21
in	21
the	21
street;	21
and	21
on	21
this	21
account,	21
and	21
because	21
he	21
was	21
somewhat	21
shortsighted,	21
my	21
lady	21
dismissed	21
him;	21
and	21
it	21
was	21
chagrin	21
at	21
this	21
I	21
am	21
convinced	21
beyond	21
a	21
doubt	21
that	21
brought	21
on	21
his	21
death.	21
I	21
was	21
left	21
a	21
helpless	21
widow,	21
with	21
a	21
daughter	21
on	21
my	21
hands	21
growing	21
up	21
in	21
beauty	21
like	21
the	21
sea-foam;	21
at	21
length,	21
however,	21
as	21
I	21
had	21
the	21
character	21
of	21
being	21
an	21
excellent	21
needlewoman,	21
my	21
lady	21
the	21
duchess,	21
then	21
lately	21
married	21
to	21
my	21
lord	21
the	21
duke,	21
offered	21
to	21
take	21
me	21
with	21
her	21
to	21
this	21
kingdom	21
of	21
Aragon,	21
and	21
my	21
daughter	21
also,	21
and	21
here	21
as	21
time	21
went	21
by	21
my	21
daughter	21
grew	21
up	21
and	21
with	21
her	21
all	21
the	21
graces	21
in	21
the	21
world;	21
she	21
sings	21
like	21
a	21
lark,	21
dances	21
quick	21
as	21
thought,	21
foots	21
it	21
like	21
a	21
gipsy,	21
reads	21
and	21
writes	21
like	21
a	21
schoolmaster,	21
and	21
does	21
sums	21
like	21
a	21
miser;	21
of	21
her	21
neatness	21
I	21
say	21
nothing,	21
for	21
the	21
running	21
water	21
is	21
not	21
purer,	21
and	21
her	21
age	21
is	21
now,	21
if	21
my	21
memory	21
serves	21
me,	21
sixteen	21
years	21
five	21
months	21
and	21
three	21
days,	21
one	21
more	21
or	21
less.	21
To	21
come	21
to	21
the	21
point,	21
the	21
son	21
of	21
a	21
very	21
rich	21
farmer,	21
living	21
in	21
a	21
village	21
of	21
my	21
lord	21
the	21
duke’s	21
not	21
very	21
far	21
from	21
here,	21
fell	21
in	21
love	21
with	21
this	21
girl	21
of	21
mine;	21
and	21
in	21
short,	21
how	21
I	21
know	21
not,	21
they	21
came	21
together,	21
and	21
under	21
the	21
promise	21
of	21
marrying	21
her	21
he	21
made	21
a	21
fool	21
of	21
my	21
daughter,	21
and	21
will	21
not	21
keep	21
his	21
word.	21
And	21
though	21
my	21
lord	21
the	21
duke	21
is	21
aware	21
of	21
it	21
(for	21
I	21
have	21
complained	21
to	21
him,	21
not	21
once	21
but	21
many	21
and	21
many	21
a	21
time,	21
and	21
entreated	21
him	21
to	21
order	21
the	21
farmer	21
to	21
marry	21
my	21
daughter),	21
he	21
turns	21
a	21
deaf	21
ear	21
and	21
will	21
scarcely	21
listen	21
to	21
me;	21
the	21
reason	21
being	21
that	21
as	21
the	21
deceiver’s	21
father	21
is	21
so	21
rich,	21
and	21
lends	21
him	21
money,	21
and	21
is	21
constantly	21
going	21
security	21
for	21
his	21
debts,	21
he	21
does	21
not	21
like	21
to	21
offend	21
or	21
annoy	21
him	21
in	21
any	21
way.	21
Now,	21
señor,	21
I	21
want	21
your	21
worship	21
to	21
take	21
it	21
upon	21
yourself	21
to	21
redress	21
this	21
wrong	21
either	21
by	21
entreaty	21
or	21
by	21
arms;	21
for	21
by	21
what	21
all	21
the	21
world	21
says	21
you	21
came	21
into	21
it	21
to	21
redress	21
grievances	21
and	21
right	21
wrongs	21
and	21
help	21
the	21
unfortunate.	21
Let	21
your	21
worship	21
put	21
before	21
you	21
the	21
unprotected	21
condition	21
of	21
my	21
daughter,	21
her	21
youth,	21
and	21
all	21
the	21
perfections	21
I	21
have	21
said	21
she	21
possesses;	21
and	21
before	21
God	21
and	21
on	21
my	21
conscience,	21
out	21
of	21
all	21
the	21
damsels	21
my	21
lady	21
has,	21
there	21
is	21
not	21
one	21
that	21
comes	21
up	21
to	21
the	21
sole	21
of	21
her	21
shoe,	21
and	21
the	21
one	21
they	21
call	21
Altisidora,	21
and	21
look	21
upon	21
as	21
the	21
boldest	21
and	21
gayest	21
of	21
them,	21
put	21
in	21
comparison	21
with	21
my	21
daughter,	21
does	21
not	21
come	21
within	21
two	21
leagues	21
of	21
her.	21
For	21
I	21
would	21
have	21
you	21
know,	21
señor,	21
all	21
is	21
not	21
gold	21
that	21
glitters,	21
and	21
that	21
same	21
little	21
Altisidora	21
has	21
more	21
forwardness	21
than	21
good	21
looks,	21
and	21
more	21
impudence	21
than	21
modesty;	21
besides	21
being	21
not	21
very	21
sound,	21
for	21
she	21
has	21
such	21
a	21
disagreeable	21
breath	21
that	21
one	21
cannot	21
bear	21
to	21
be	21
near	21
her	21
for	21
a	21
moment;	21
and	21
even	21
my	21
lady	21
the	21
duchess—but	21
I’ll	21
hold	21
my	21
tongue,	21
for	21
they	21
say	21
that	21
walls	21
have	21
ears.”	21
“For	21
heaven’s	21
sake,	21
Doña	21
Rodriguez,	21
what	21
ails	21
my	21
lady	21
the	21
duchess?”	21
asked	21
Don	21
Quixote.	21
“Adjured	21
in	21
that	21
way,”	21
replied	21
the	21
duenna,	21
“I	21
cannot	21
help	21
answering	21
the	21
question	21
and	21
telling	21
the	21
whole	21
truth.	21
Señor	21
Don	21
Quixote,	21
have	21
you	21
observed	21
the	21
comeliness	21
of	21
my	21
lady	21
the	21
duchess,	21
that	21
smooth	21
complexion	21
of	21
hers	21
like	21
a	21
burnished	21
polished	21
sword,	21
those	21
two	21
cheeks	21
of	21
milk	21
and	21
carmine,	21
that	21
gay	21
lively	21
step	21
with	21
which	21
she	21
treads	21
or	21
rather	21
seems	21
to	21
spurn	21
the	21
earth,	21
so	21
that	21
one	21
would	21
fancy	21
she	21
went	21
radiating	21
health	21
wherever	21
she	21
passed?	21
Well	21
then,	21
let	21
me	21
tell	21
you	21
she	21
may	21
thank,	21
first	21
of	21
all	21
God,	21
for	21
this,	21
and	21
next,	21
two	21
issues	21
that	21
she	21
has,	21
one	21
in	21
each	21
leg,	21
by	21
which	21
all	21
the	21
evil	21
humours,	21
of	21
which	21
the	21
doctors	21
say	21
she	21
is	21
full,	21
are	21
discharged.”	21
“Blessed	21
Virgin!”	21
exclaimed	21
Don	21
Quixote;	21
“and	21
is	21
it	21
possible	21
that	21
my	21
lady	21
the	21
duchess	21
has	21
drains	21
of	21
that	21
sort?	21
I	21
would	21
not	21
have	21
believed	21
it	21
if	21
the	21
barefoot	21
friars	21
had	21
told	21
it	21
me;	21
but	21
as	21
the	21
lady	21
Doña	21
Rodriguez	21
says	21
so,	21
it	21
must	21
be	21
so.	21
But	21
surely	21
such	21
issues,	21
and	21
in	21
such	21
places,	21
do	21
not	21
discharge	21
humours,	21
but	21
liquid	21
amber.	21
Verily,	21
I	21
do	21
believe	21
now	21
that	21
this	21
practice	21
of	21
opening	21
issues	21
is	21
a	21
very	21
important	21
matter	21
for	21
the	21
health.”	21
Don	21
Quixote	21
had	21
hardly	21
said	21
this,	21
when	21
the	21
chamber	21
door	21
flew	21
open	21
with	21
a	21
loud	21
bang,	21
and	21
with	21
the	21
start	21
the	21
noise	21
gave	21
her	21
Doña	21
Rodriguez	21
let	21
the	21
candle	21
fall	21
from	21
her	21
hand,	21
and	21
the	21
room	21
was	21
left	21
as	21
dark	21
as	21
a	21
wolf’s	21
mouth,	21
as	21
the	21
saying	21
is.	21
Suddenly	21
the	21
poor	21
duenna	21
felt	21
two	21
hands	21
seize	21
her	21
by	21
the	21
throat,	21
so	21
tightly	21
that	21
she	21
could	21
not	21
croak,	21
while	21
someone	21
else,	21
without	21
uttering	21
a	21
word,	21
very	21
briskly	21
hoisted	21
up	21
her	21
petticoats,	21
and	21
with	21
what	21
seemed	21
to	21
be	21
a	21
slipper	21
began	21
to	21
lay	21
on	21
so	21
heartily	21
that	21
anyone	21
would	21
have	21
felt	21
pity	21
for	21
her;	21
but	21
although	21
Don	21
Quixote	21
felt	21
it	21
he	21
never	21
stirred	21
from	21
his	21
bed,	21
but	21
lay	21
quiet	21
and	21
silent,	21
nay	21
apprehensive	21
that	21
his	21
turn	21
for	21
a	21
drubbing	21
might	21
be	21
coming.	21
Nor	21
was	21
the	21
apprehension	21
an	21
idle	21
one;	21
for	21
leaving	21
the	21
duenna	21
(who	21
did	21
not	21
dare	21
to	21
cry	21
out)	21
well	21
basted,	21
the	21
silent	21
executioners	21
fell	21
upon	21
Don	21
Quixote,	21
and	21
stripping	21
him	21
of	21
the	21
sheet	21
and	21
the	21
coverlet,	21
they	21
pinched	21
him	21
so	21
fast	21
and	21
so	21
hard	21
that	21
he	21
was	21
driven	21
to	21
defend	21
himself	21
with	21
his	21
fists,	21
and	21
all	21
this	21
in	21
marvellous	21
silence.	21
The	21
battle	21
lasted	21
nearly	21
half	21
an	21
hour,	21
and	21
then	21
the	21
phantoms	21
fled;	21
Doña	21
Rodriguez	21
gathered	21
up	21
her	21
skirts,	21
and	21
bemoaning	21
her	21
fate	21
went	21
out	21
without	21
saying	21
a	21
word	21
to	21
Don	21
Quixote,	21
and	21
he,	21
sorely	21
pinched,	21
puzzled,	21
and	21
dejected,	21
remained	21
alone,	21
and	21
there	21
we	21
will	21
leave	21
him,	21
wondering	21
who	21
could	21
have	21
been	21
the	21
perverse	21
enchanter	21
who	21
had	21
reduced	21
him	21
to	21
such	21
a	21
state;	21
but	21
that	21
shall	21
be	21
told	21
in	21
due	21
season,	21
for	21
Sancho	21
claims	21
our	21
attention,	21
and	21
the	21
methodical	21
arrangement	21
of	21
the	21
story	21
demands	21
it.	21

Full	21
Size	21
We	21
left	21
the	21
great	21
governor	21
angered	21
and	21
irritated	21
by	21
that	21
portrait-painting	21
rogue	21
of	21
a	21
farmer	21
who,	21
instructed	21
the	21
majordomo,	21
as	21
the	21
majordomo	21
was	21
by	21
the	21
duke,	21
tried	21
to	21
practise	21
upon	21
him;	21
he	21
however,	21
fool,	21
boor,	21
and	21
clown	21
as	21
he	21
was,	21
held	21
his	21
own	21
against	21
them	21
all,	21
saying	21
to	21
those	21
round	21
him	21
and	21
to	21
Doctor	21
Pedro	21
Recio,	21
who	21
as	21
soon	21
as	21
the	21
private	21
business	21
of	21
the	21
duke’s	21
letter	21
was	21
disposed	21
of	21
had	21
returned	21
to	21
the	21
room,	21
“Now	21
I	21
see	21
plainly	21
enough	21
that	21
judges	21
and	21
governors	21
ought	21
to	21
be	21
and	21
must	21
be	21
made	21
of	21
brass	21
not	21
to	21
feel	21
the	21
importunities	21
of	21
the	21
applicants	21
that	21
at	21
all	21
times	21
and	21
all	21
seasons	21
insist	21
on	21
being	21
heard,	21
and	21
having	21
their	21
business	21
despatched,	21
and	21
their	21
own	21
affairs	21
and	21
no	21
others	21
attended	21
to,	21
come	21
what	21
may;	21
and	21
if	21
the	21
poor	21
judge	21
does	21
not	21
hear	21
them	21
and	21
settle	21
the	21
matter—either	21
because	21
he	21
cannot	21
or	21
because	21
that	21
is	21
not	21
the	21
time	21
set	21
apart	21
for	21
hearing	21
them—forthwith	21
they	21
abuse	21
him,	21
and	21
run	21
him	21
down,	21
and	21
gnaw	21
at	21
his	21
bones,	21
and	21
even	21
pick	21
holes	21
in	21
his	21
pedigree.	21
You	21
silly,	21
stupid	21
applicant,	21
don’t	21
be	21
in	21
a	21
hurry;	21
wait	21
for	21
the	21
proper	21
time	21
and	21
season	21
for	21
doing	21
business;	21
don’t	21
come	21
at	21
dinner-hour,	21
or	21
at	21
bed-time;	21
for	21
judges	21
are	21
only	21
flesh	21
and	21
blood,	21
and	21
must	21
give	21
to	21
Nature	21
what	21
she	21
naturally	21
demands	21
of	21
them;	21
all	21
except	21
myself,	21
for	21
in	21
my	21
case	21
I	21
give	21
her	21
nothing	21
to	21
eat,	21
thanks	21
to	21
Señor	21
Doctor	21
Pedro	21
Recio	21
Tirteafuera	21
here,	21
who	21
would	21
have	21
me	21
die	21
of	21
hunger,	21
and	21
declares	21
that	21
death	21
to	21
be	21
life;	21
and	21
the	21
same	21
sort	21
of	21
life	21
may	21
God	21
give	21
him	21
and	21
all	21
his	21
kind—I	21
mean	21
the	21
bad	21
doctors;	21
for	21
the	21
good	21
ones	21
deserve	21
palms	21
and	21
laurels.”	21
All	21
who	21
knew	21
Sancho	21
Panza	21
were	21
astonished	21
to	21
hear	21
him	21
speak	21
so	21
elegantly,	21
and	21
did	21
not	21
know	21
what	21
to	21
attribute	21
it	21
to	21
unless	21
it	21
were	21
that	21
office	21
and	21
grave	21
responsibility	21
either	21
smarten	21
or	21
stupefy	21
men’s	21
wits.	21
At	21
last	21
Doctor	21
Pedro	21
Recio	21
Agilers	21
of	21
Tirteafuera	21
promised	21
to	21
let	21
him	21
have	21
supper	21
that	21
night	21
though	21
it	21
might	21
be	21
in	21
contravention	21
of	21
all	21
the	21
aphorisms	21
of	21
Hippocrates.	21
With	21
this	21
the	21
governor	21
was	21
satisfied	21
and	21
looked	21
forward	21
to	21
the	21
approach	21
of	21
night	21
and	21
supper-time	21
with	21
great	21
anxiety;	21
and	21
though	21
time,	21
to	21
his	21
mind,	21
stood	21
still	21
and	21
made	21
no	21
progress,	21
nevertheless	21
the	21
hour	21
he	21
so	21
longed	21
for	21
came,	21
and	21
they	21
gave	21
him	21
a	21
beef	21
salad	21
with	21
onions	21
and	21
some	21
boiled	21
calves’	21
feet	21
rather	21
far	21
gone.	21
At	21
this	21
he	21
fell	21
to	21
with	21
greater	21
relish	21
than	21
if	21
they	21
had	21
given	21
him	21
francolins	21
from	21
Milan,	21
pheasants	21
from	21
Rome,	21
veal	21
from	21
Sorrento,	21
partridges	21
from	21
Moron,	21
or	21
geese	21
from	21
Lavajos,	21
and	21
turning	21
to	21
the	21
doctor	21
at	21
supper	21
he	21
said	21
to	21
him,	21
“Look	21
here,	21
señor	21
doctor,	21
for	21
the	21
future	21
don’t	21
trouble	21
yourself	21
about	21
giving	21
me	21
dainty	21
things	21
or	21
choice	21
dishes	21
to	21
eat,	21
for	21
it	21
will	21
be	21
only	21
taking	21
my	21
stomach	21
off	21
its	21
hinges;	21
it	21
is	21
accustomed	21
to	21
goat,	21
cow,	21
bacon,	21
hung	21
beef,	21
turnips	21
and	21
onions;	21
and	21
if	21
by	21
any	21
chance	21
it	21
is	21
given	21
these	21
palace	21
dishes,	21
it	21
receives	21
them	21
squeamishly,	21
and	21
sometimes	21
with	21
loathing.	21
What	21
the	21
head-carver	21
had	21
best	21
do	21
is	21
to	21
serve	21
me	21
with	21
what	21
they	21
call	21
ollas	21
podridas	21
(and	21
the	21
rottener	21
they	21
are	21
the	21
better	21
they	21
smell);	21
and	21
he	21
can	21
put	21
whatever	21
he	21
likes	21
into	21
them,	21
so	21
long	21
as	21
it	21
is	21
good	21
to	21
eat,	21
and	21
I’ll	21
be	21
obliged	21
to	21
him,	21
and	21
will	21
requite	21
him	21
some	21
day.	21
But	21
let	21
nobody	21
play	21
pranks	21
on	21
me,	21
for	21
either	21
we	21
are	21
or	21
we	21
are	21
not;	21
let	21
us	21
live	21
and	21
eat	21
in	21
peace	21
and	21
good-fellowship,	21
for	21
when	21
God	21
sends	21
the	21
dawn,	21
he	21
sends	21
it	21
for	21
all.	21
I	21
mean	21
to	21
govern	21
this	21
island	21
without	21
giving	21
up	21
a	21
right	21
or	21
taking	21
a	21
bribe;	21
let	21
everyone	21
keep	21
his	21
eye	21
open,	21
and	21
look	21
out	21
for	21
the	21
arrow;	21
for	21
I	21
can	21
tell	21
them	21
‘the	21
devil’s	21
in	21
Cantillana,’	21
and	21
if	21
they	21
drive	21
me	21
to	21
it	21
they’ll	21
see	21
something	21
that	21
will	21
astonish	21
them.	21
Nay!	21
make	21
yourself	21
honey	21
and	21
the	21
flies	21
eat	21
you.”	21
“Of	21
a	21
truth,	21
señor	21
governor,”	21
said	21
the	21
carver,	21
“your	21
worship	21
is	21
in	21
the	21
right	21
of	21
it	21
in	21
everything	21
you	21
have	21
said;	21
and	21
I	21
promise	21
you	21
in	21
the	21
name	21
of	21
all	21
the	21
inhabitants	21
of	21
this	21
island	21
that	21
they	21
will	21
serve	21
your	21
worship	21
with	21
all	21
zeal,	21
affection,	21
and	21
good-will,	21
for	21
the	21
mild	21
kind	21
of	21
government	21
you	21
have	21
given	21
a	21
sample	21
of	21
to	21
begin	21
with,	21
leaves	21
them	21
no	21
ground	21
for	21
doing	21
or	21
thinking	21
anything	21
to	21
your	21
worship’s	21
disadvantage.”	21
“That	21
I	21
believe,”	21
said	21
Sancho;	21
“and	21
they	21
would	21
be	21
great	21
fools	21
if	21
they	21
did	21
or	21
thought	21
otherwise;	21
once	21
more	21
I	21
say,	21
see	21
to	21
my	21
feeding	21
and	21
my	21
Dapple’s	21
for	21
that	21
is	21
the	21
great	21
point	21
and	21
what	21
is	21
most	21
to	21
the	21
purpose;	21
and	21
when	21
the	21
hour	21
comes	21
let	21
us	21
go	21
the	21
rounds,	21
for	21
it	21
is	21
my	21
intention	21
to	21
purge	21
this	21
island	21
of	21
all	21
manner	21
of	21
uncleanness	21
and	21
of	21
all	21
idle	21
good-for-nothing	21
vagabonds;	21
for	21
I	21
would	21
have	21
you	21
know	21
that	21
lazy	21
idlers	21
are	21
the	21
same	21
thing	21
in	21
a	21
State	21
as	21
the	21
drones	21
in	21
a	21
hive,	21
that	21
eat	21
up	21
the	21
honey	21
the	21
industrious	21
bees	21
make.	21
I	21
mean	21
to	21
protect	21
the	21
husbandman,	21
to	21
preserve	21
to	21
the	21
gentleman	21
his	21
privileges,	21
to	21
reward	21
the	21
virtuous,	21
and	21
above	21
all	21
to	21
respect	21
religion	21
and	21
honour	21
its	21
ministers.	21
What	21
say	21
you	21
to	21
that,	21
my	21
friends?	21
Is	21
there	21
anything	21
in	21
what	21
I	21
say,	21
or	21
am	21
I	21
talking	21
to	21
no	21
purpose?”	21
“There	21
is	21
so	21
much	21
in	21
what	21
your	21
worship	21
says,	21
señor	21
governor,”	21
said	21
the	21
majordomo,	21
“that	21
I	21
am	21
filled	21
with	21
wonder	21
when	21
I	21
see	21
a	21
man	21
like	21
your	21
worship,	21
entirely	21
without	21
learning	21
(for	21
I	21
believe	21
you	21
have	21
none	21
at	21
all),	21
say	21
such	21
things,	21
and	21
so	21
full	21
of	21
sound	21
maxims	21
and	21
sage	21
remarks,	21
very	21
different	21
from	21
what	21
was	21
expected	21
of	21
your	21
worship’s	21
intelligence	21
by	21
those	21
who	21
sent	21
us	21
or	21
by	21
us	21
who	21
came	21
here.	21
Every	21
day	21
we	21
see	21
something	21
new	21
in	21
this	21
world;	21
jokes	21
become	21
realities,	21
and	21
the	21
jokers	21
find	21
the	21
tables	21
turned	21
upon	21
them.”	21
Night	21
came,	21
and	21
with	21
the	21
permission	21
of	21
Doctor	21
Pedro	21
Recio,	21
the	21
governor	21
had	21
supper.	21
They	21
then	21
got	21
ready	21
to	21
go	21
the	21
rounds,	21
and	21
he	21
started	21
with	21
the	21
majordomo,	21
the	21
secretary,	21
the	21
head-carver,	21
the	21
chronicler	21
charged	21
with	21
recording	21
his	21
deeds,	21
and	21
alguacils	21
and	21
notaries	21
enough	21
to	21
form	21
a	21
fair-sized	21
squadron.	21
In	21
the	21
midst	21
marched	21
Sancho	21
with	21
his	21
staff,	21
as	21
fine	21
a	21
sight	21
as	21
one	21
could	21
wish	21
to	21
see,	21
and	21
but	21
a	21
few	21
streets	21
of	21
the	21
town	21
had	21
been	21
traversed	21
when	21
they	21
heard	21
a	21
noise	21
as	21
of	21
a	21
clashing	21
of	21
swords.	21
They	21
hastened	21
to	21
the	21
spot,	21
and	21
found	21
that	21
the	21
combatants	21
were	21
but	21
two,	21
who	21
seeing	21
the	21
authorities	21
approaching	21
stood	21
still,	21
and	21
one	21
of	21
them	21
exclaimed,	21
“Help,	21
in	21
the	21
name	21
of	21
God	21
and	21
the	21
king!	21
Are	21
men	21
to	21
be	21
allowed	21
to	21
rob	21
in	21
the	21
middle	21
of	21
this	21
town,	21
and	21
rush	21
out	21
and	21
attack	21
people	21
in	21
the	21
very	21
streets?”	21
“Be	21
calm,	21
my	21
good	21
man,”	21
said	21
Sancho,	21
“and	21
tell	21
me	21
what	21
the	21
cause	21
of	21
this	21
quarrel	21
is;	21
for	21
I	21
am	21
the	21
governor.”	21
Said	21
the	21
other	21
combatant,	21
“Señor	21
governor,	21
I	21
will	21
tell	21
you	21
in	21
a	21
very	21
few	21
words.	21
Your	21
worship	21
must	21
know	21
that	21
this	21
gentleman	21
has	21
just	21
now	21
won	21
more	21
than	21
a	21
thousand	21
reals	21
in	21
that	21
gambling	21
house	21
opposite,	21
and	21
God	21
knows	21
how.	21
I	21
was	21
there,	21
and	21
gave	21
more	21
than	21
one	21
doubtful	21
point	21
in	21
his	21
favour,	21
very	21
much	21
against	21
what	21
my	21
conscience	21
told	21
me.	21
He	21
made	21
off	21
with	21
his	21
winnings,	21
and	21
when	21
I	21
made	21
sure	21
he	21
was	21
going	21
to	21
give	21
me	21
a	21
crown	21
or	21
so	21
at	21
least	21
by	21
way	21
of	21
a	21
present,	21
as	21
it	21
is	21
usual	21
and	21
customary	21
to	21
give	21
men	21
of	21
quality	21
of	21
my	21
sort	21
who	21
stand	21
by	21
to	21
see	21
fair	21
or	21
foul	21
play,	21
and	21
back	21
up	21
swindles,	21
and	21
prevent	21
quarrels,	21
he	21
pocketed	21
his	21
money	21
and	21
left	21
the	21
house.	21
Indignant	21
at	21
this	21
I	21
followed	21
him,	21
and	21
speaking	21
to	21
him	21
fairly	21
and	21
civilly	21
asked	21
him	21
to	21
give	21
me	21
if	21
it	21
were	21
only	21
eight	21
reals,	21
for	21
he	21
knows	21
I	21
am	21
an	21
honest	21
man	21
and	21
that	21
I	21
have	21
neither	21
profession	21
nor	21
property,	21
for	21
my	21
parents	21
never	21
brought	21
me	21
up	21
to	21
any	21
or	21
left	21
me	21
any;	21
but	21
the	21
rogue,	21
who	21
is	21
a	21
greater	21
thief	21
than	21
Cacus	21
and	21
a	21
greater	21
sharper	21
than	21
Andradilla,	21
would	21
not	21
give	21
me	21
more	21
than	21
four	21
reals;	21
so	21
your	21
worship	21
may	21
see	21
how	21
little	21
shame	21
and	21
conscience	21
he	21
has.	21
But	21
by	21
my	21
faith	21
if	21
you	21
had	21
not	21
come	21
up	21
I’d	21
have	21
made	21
him	21
disgorge	21
his	21
winnings,	21
and	21
he’d	21
have	21
learned	21
what	21
the	21
range	21
of	21
the	21
steel-yard	21
was.”	21
“What	21
say	21
you	21
to	21
this?”	21
asked	21
Sancho.	21
The	21
other	21
replied	21
that	21
all	21
his	21
antagonist	21
said	21
was	21
true,	21
and	21
that	21
he	21
did	21
not	21
choose	21
to	21
give	21
him	21
more	21
than	21
four	21
reals	21
because	21
he	21
very	21
often	21
gave	21
him	21
money;	21
and	21
that	21
those	21
who	21
expected	21
presents	21
ought	21
to	21
be	21
civil	21
and	21
take	21
what	21
is	21
given	21
them	21
with	21
a	21
cheerful	21
countenance,	21
and	21
not	21
make	21
any	21
claim	21
against	21
winners	21
unless	21
they	21
know	21
them	21
for	21
certain	21
to	21
be	21
sharpers	21
and	21
their	21
winnings	21
to	21
be	21
unfairly	21
won;	21
and	21
that	21
there	21
could	21
be	21
no	21
better	21
proof	21
that	21
he	21
himself	21
was	21
an	21
honest	21
man	21
than	21
his	21
having	21
refused	21
to	21
give	21
anything;	21
for	21
sharpers	21
always	21
pay	21
tribute	21
to	21
lookers-on	21
who	21
know	21
them.	21
“That	21
is	21
true,”	21
said	21
the	21
majordomo;	21
“let	21
your	21
worship	21
consider	21
what	21
is	21
to	21
be	21
done	21
with	21
these	21
men.”	21
“What	21
is	21
to	21
be	21
done,”	21
said	21
Sancho,	21
“is	21
this;	21
you,	21
the	21
winner,	21
be	21
you	21
good,	21
bad,	21
or	21
indifferent,	21
give	21
this	21
assailant	21
of	21
yours	21
a	21
hundred	21
reals	21
at	21
once,	21
and	21
you	21
must	21
disburse	21
thirty	21
more	21
for	21
the	21
poor	21
prisoners;	21
and	21
you	21
who	21
have	21
neither	21
profession	21
nor	21
property,	21
and	21
hang	21
about	21
the	21
island	21
in	21
idleness,	21
take	21
these	21
hundred	21
reals	21
now,	21
and	21
some	21
time	21
of	21
the	21
day	21
to-morrow	21
quit	21
the	21
island	21
under	21
sentence	21
of	21
banishment	21
for	21
ten	21
years,	21
and	21
under	21
pain	21
of	21
completing	21
it	21
in	21
another	21
life	21
if	21
you	21
violate	21
the	21
sentence,	21
for	21
I’ll	21
hang	21
you	21
on	21
a	21
gibbet,	21
or	21
at	21
least	21
the	21
hangman	21
will	21
by	21
my	21
orders;	21
not	21
a	21
word	21
from	21
either	21
of	21
you,	21
or	21
I’ll	21
make	21
him	21
feel	21
my	21
hand.”	21
The	21
one	21
paid	21
down	21
the	21
money	21
and	21
the	21
other	21
took	21
it,	21
and	21
the	21
latter	21
quitted	21
the	21
island,	21
while	21
the	21
other	21
went	21
home;	21
and	21
then	21
the	21
governor	21
said,	21
“Either	21
I	21
am	21
not	21
good	21
for	21
much,	21
or	21
I’ll	21
get	21
rid	21
of	21
these	21
gambling	21
houses,	21
for	21
it	21
strikes	21
me	21
they	21
are	21
very	21
mischievous.”	21
“This	21
one	21
at	21
least,”	21
said	21
one	21
of	21
the	21
notaries,	21
“your	21
worship	21
will	21
not	21
be	21
able	21
to	21
get	21
rid	21
of,	21
for	21
a	21
great	21
man	21
owns	21
it,	21
and	21
what	21
he	21
loses	21
every	21
year	21
is	21
beyond	21
all	21
comparison	21
more	21
than	21
what	21
he	21
makes	21
by	21
the	21
cards.	21
On	21
the	21
minor	21
gambling	21
houses	21
your	21
worship	21
may	21
exercise	21
your	21
power,	21
and	21
it	21
is	21
they	21
that	21
do	21
most	21
harm	21
and	21
shelter	21
the	21
most	21
barefaced	21
practices;	21
for	21
in	21
the	21
houses	21
of	21
lords	21
and	21
gentlemen	21
of	21
quality	21
the	21
notorious	21
sharpers	21
dare	21
not	21
attempt	21
to	21
play	21
their	21
tricks;	21
and	21
as	21
the	21
vice	21
of	21
gambling	21
has	21
become	21
common,	21
it	21
is	21
better	21
that	21
men	21
should	21
play	21
in	21
houses	21
of	21
repute	21
than	21
in	21
some	21
tradesman’s,	21
where	21
they	21
catch	21
an	21
unlucky	21
fellow	21
in	21
the	21
small	21
hours	21
of	21
the	21
morning	21
and	21
skin	21
him	21
alive.”	21
“I	21
know	21
already,	21
notary,	21
that	21
there	21
is	21
a	21
good	21
deal	21
to	21
be	21
said	21
on	21
that	21
point,”	21
said	21
Sancho.	21
And	21
now	21
a	21
tipstaff	21
came	21
up	21
with	21
a	21
young	21
man	21
in	21
his	21
grasp,	21
and	21
said,	21
“Señor	21
governor,	21
this	21
youth	21
was	21
coming	21
towards	21
us,	21
and	21
as	21
soon	21
as	21
he	21
saw	21
the	21
officers	21
of	21
justice	21
he	21
turned	21
about	21
and	21
ran	21
like	21
a	21
deer,	21
a	21
sure	21
proof	21
that	21
he	21
must	21
be	21
some	21
evil-doer;	21
I	21
ran	21
after	21
him,	21
and	21
had	21
it	21
not	21
been	21
that	21
he	21
stumbled	21
and	21
fell,	21
I	21
should	21
never	21
have	21
caught	21
him.”	21
“What	21
did	21
you	21
run	21
for,	21
fellow?”	21
said	21
Sancho.	21
To	21
which	21
the	21
young	21
man	21
replied,	21
“Señor,	21
it	21
was	21
to	21
avoid	21
answering	21
all	21
the	21
questions	21
officers	21
of	21
justice	21
put.”	21
“What	21
are	21
you	21
by	21
trade?”	21
“A	21
weaver.”	21
“And	21
what	21
do	21
you	21
weave?”	21
“Lance	21
heads,	21
with	21
your	21
worship’s	21
good	21
leave.”	21
“You’re	21
facetious	21
with	21
me!	21
You	21
plume	21
yourself	21
on	21
being	21
a	21
wag?	21
Very	21
good;	21
and	21
where	21
were	21
you	21
going	21
just	21
now?”	21
“To	21
take	21
the	21
air,	21
señor.”	21
“And	21
where	21
does	21
one	21
take	21
the	21
air	21
in	21
this	21
island?”	21
“Where	21
it	21
blows.”	21
“Good!	21
your	21
answers	21
are	21
very	21
much	21
to	21
the	21
point;	21
you	21
are	21
a	21
smart	21
youth;	21
but	21
take	21
notice	21
that	21
I	21
am	21
the	21
air,	21
and	21
that	21
I	21
blow	21
upon	21
you	21
a-stern,	21
and	21
send	21
you	21
to	21
gaol.	21
Ho	21
there!	21
lay	21
hold	21
of	21
him	21
and	21
take	21
him	21
off;	21
I’ll	21
make	21
him	21
sleep	21
there	21
to-night	21
without	21
air.”	21
“By	21
God,”	21
said	21
the	21
young	21
man,	21
“your	21
worship	21
will	21
make	21
me	21
sleep	21
in	21
gaol	21
just	21
as	21
soon	21
as	21
make	21
me	21
king.”	21
“Why	21
shan’t	21
I	21
make	21
thee	21
sleep	21
in	21
gaol?”	21
said	21
Sancho.	21
“Have	21
I	21
not	21
the	21
power	21
to	21
arrest	21
thee	21
and	21
release	21
thee	21
whenever	21
I	21
like?”	21
“All	21
the	21
power	21
your	21
worship	21
has,”	21
said	21
the	21
young	21
man,	21
“won’t	21
be	21
able	21
to	21
make	21
me	21
sleep	21
in	21
gaol.”	21
“How?	21
not	21
able!”	21
said	21
Sancho;	21
“take	21
him	21
away	21
at	21
once	21
where	21
he’ll	21
see	21
his	21
mistake	21
with	21
his	21
own	21
eyes,	21
even	21
if	21
the	21
gaoler	21
is	21
willing	21
to	21
exert	21
his	21
interested	21
generosity	21
on	21
his	21
behalf;	21
for	21
I’ll	21
lay	21
a	21
penalty	21
of	21
two	21
thousand	21
ducats	21
on	21
him	21
if	21
he	21
allows	21
him	21
to	21
stir	21
a	21
step	21
from	21
the	21
prison.”	21
“That’s	21
ridiculous,”	21
said	21
the	21
young	21
man;	21
“the	21
fact	21
is,	21
all	21
the	21
men	21
on	21
earth	21
will	21
not	21
make	21
me	21
sleep	21
in	21
prison.”	21
“Tell	21
me,	21
you	21
devil,”	21
said	21
Sancho,	21
“have	21
you	21
got	21
any	21
angel	21
that	21
will	21
deliver	21
you,	21
and	21
take	21
off	21
the	21
irons	21
I	21
am	21
going	21
to	21
order	21
them	21
to	21
put	21
upon	21
you?”	21
“Now,	21
señor	21
governor,”	21
said	21
the	21
young	21
man	21
in	21
a	21
sprightly	21
manner,	21
“let	21
us	21
be	21
reasonable	21
and	21
come	21
to	21
the	21
point.	21
Granted	21
your	21
worship	21
may	21
order	21
me	21
to	21
be	21
taken	21
to	21
prison,	21
and	21
to	21
have	21
irons	21
and	21
chains	21
put	21
on	21
me,	21
and	21
to	21
be	21
shut	21
up	21
in	21
a	21
cell,	21
and	21
may	21
lay	21
heavy	21
penalties	21
on	21
the	21
gaoler	21
if	21
he	21
lets	21
me	21
out,	21
and	21
that	21
he	21
obeys	21
your	21
orders;	21
still,	21
if	21
I	21
don’t	21
choose	21
to	21
sleep,	21
and	21
choose	21
to	21
remain	21
awake	21
all	21
night	21
without	21
closing	21
an	21
eye,	21
will	21
your	21
worship	21
with	21
all	21
your	21
power	21
be	21
able	21
to	21
make	21
me	21
sleep	21
if	21
I	21
don’t	21
choose?”	21
“No,	21
truly,”	21
said	21
the	21
secretary,	21
“and	21
the	21
fellow	21
has	21
made	21
his	21
point.”	21
“So	21
then,”	21
said	21
Sancho,	21
“it	21
would	21
be	21
entirely	21
of	21
your	21
own	21
choice	21
you	21
would	21
keep	21
from	21
sleeping;	21
not	21
in	21
opposition	21
to	21
my	21
will?”	21
“No,	21
señor,”	21
said	21
the	21
youth,	21
“certainly	21
not.”	21
“Well	21
then,	21
go,	21
and	21
God	21
be	21
with	21
you,”	21
said	21
Sancho;	21
“be	21
off	21
home	21
to	21
sleep,	21
and	21
God	21
give	21
you	21
sound	21
sleep,	21
for	21
I	21
don’t	21
want	21
to	21
rob	21
you	21
of	21
it;	21
but	21
for	21
the	21
future,	21
let	21
me	21
advise	21
you	21
don’t	21
joke	21
with	21
the	21
authorities,	21
because	21
you	21
may	21
come	21
across	21
someone	21
who	21
will	21
bring	21
down	21
the	21
joke	21
on	21
your	21
own	21
skull.”	21
The	21
young	21
man	21
went	21
his	21
way,	21
and	21
the	21
governor	21
continued	21
his	21
round,	21
and	21
shortly	21
afterwards	21
two	21
tipstaffs	21
came	21
up	21
with	21
a	21
man	21
in	21
custody,	21
and	21
said,	21
“Señor	21
governor,	21
this	21
person,	21
who	21
seems	21
to	21
be	21
a	21
man,	21
is	21
not	21
so,	21
but	21
a	21
woman,	21
and	21
not	21
an	21
ill-favoured	21
one,	21
in	21
man’s	21
clothes.”	21
They	21
raised	21
two	21
or	21
three	21
lanterns	21
to	21
her	21
face,	21
and	21
by	21
their	21
light	21
they	21
distinguished	21
the	21
features	21
of	21
a	21
woman	21
to	21
all	21
appearance	21
of	21
the	21
age	21
of	21
sixteen	21
or	21
a	21
little	21
more,	21
with	21
her	21
hair	21
gathered	21
into	21
a	21
gold	21
and	21
green	21
silk	21
net,	21
and	21
fair	21
as	21
a	21
thousand	21
pearls.	21
They	21
scanned	21
her	21
from	21
head	21
to	21
foot,	21
and	21
observed	21
that	21
she	21
had	21
on	21
red	21
silk	21
stockings	21
with	21
garters	21
of	21
white	21
taffety	21
bordered	21
with	21
gold	21
and	21
pearl;	21
her	21
breeches	21
were	21
of	21
green	21
and	21
gold	21
stuff,	21
and	21
under	21
an	21
open	21
jacket	21
or	21
jerkin	21
of	21
the	21
same	21
she	21
wore	21
a	21
doublet	21
of	21
the	21
finest	21
white	21
and	21
gold	21
cloth;	21
her	21
shoes	21
were	21
white	21
and	21
such	21
as	21
men	21
wear;	21
she	21
carried	21
no	21
sword	21
at	21
her	21
belt,	21
but	21
only	21
a	21
richly	21
ornamented	21
dagger,	21
and	21
on	21
her	21
fingers	21
she	21
had	21
several	21
handsome	21
rings.	21
In	21
short,	21
the	21
girl	21
seemed	21
fair	21
to	21
look	21
at	21
in	21
the	21
eyes	21
of	21
all,	21
and	21
none	21
of	21
those	21
who	21
beheld	21
her	21
knew	21
her,	21
the	21
people	21
of	21
the	21
town	21
said	21
they	21
could	21
not	21
imagine	21
who	21
she	21
was,	21
and	21
those	21
who	21
were	21
in	21
on	21
the	21
secret	21
of	21
the	21
jokes	21
that	21
were	21
to	21
be	21
practised	21
upon	21
Sancho	21
were	21
the	21
ones	21
who	21
were	21
most	21
surprised,	21
for	21
this	21
incident	21
or	21
discovery	21
had	21
not	21
been	21
arranged	21
by	21
them;	21
and	21
they	21
watched	21
anxiously	21
to	21
see	21
how	21
the	21
affair	21
would	21
end.	21
Sancho	21
was	21
fascinated	21
by	21
the	21
girl’s	21
beauty,	21
and	21
he	21
asked	21
her	21
who	21
she	21
was,	21
where	21
she	21
was	21
going,	21
and	21
what	21
had	21
induced	21
her	21
to	21
dress	21
herself	21
in	21
that	21
garb.	21
She	21
with	21
her	21
eyes	21
fixed	21
on	21
the	21
ground	21
answered	21
in	21
modest	21
confusion,	21
“I	21
cannot	21
tell	21
you,	21
señor,	21
before	21
so	21
many	21
people	21
what	21
it	21
is	21
of	21
such	21
consequence	21
to	21
me	21
to	21
have	21
kept	21
secret;	21
one	21
thing	21
I	21
wish	21
to	21
be	21
known,	21
that	21
I	21
am	21
no	21
thief	21
or	21
evildoer,	21
but	21
only	21
an	21
unhappy	21
maiden	21
whom	21
the	21
power	21
of	21
jealousy	21
has	21
led	21
to	21
break	21
through	21
the	21
respect	21
that	21
is	21
due	21
to	21
modesty.”	21
Hearing	21
this	21
the	21
majordomo	21
said	21
to	21
Sancho,	21
“Make	21
the	21
people	21
stand	21
back,	21
señor	21
governor,	21
that	21
this	21
lady	21
may	21
say	21
what	21
she	21
wishes	21
with	21
less	21
embarrassment.”	21
Sancho	21
gave	21
the	21
order,	21
and	21
all	21
except	21
the	21
majordomo,	21
the	21
head-carver,	21
and	21
the	21
secretary	21
fell	21
back.	21
Finding	21
herself	21
then	21
in	21
the	21
presence	21
of	21
no	21
more,	21
the	21
damsel	21
went	21
on	21
to	21
say,	21
“I	21
am	21
the	21
daughter,	21
sirs,	21
of	21
Pedro	21
Perez	21
Mazorca,	21
the	21
wool-farmer	21
of	21
this	21
town,	21
who	21
is	21
in	21
the	21
habit	21
of	21
coming	21
very	21
often	21
to	21
my	21
father’s	21
house.”	21
“That	21
won’t	21
do,	21
señora,”	21
said	21
the	21
majordomo;	21
“for	21
I	21
know	21
Pedro	21
Perez	21
very	21
well,	21
and	21
I	21
know	21
he	21
has	21
no	21
child	21
at	21
all,	21
either	21
son	21
or	21
daughter;	21
and	21
besides,	21
though	21
you	21
say	21
he	21
is	21
your	21
father,	21
you	21
add	21
then	21
that	21
he	21
comes	21
very	21
often	21
to	21
your	21
father’s	21
house.”	21
“I	21
had	21
already	21
noticed	21
that,”	21
said	21
Sancho.	21
“I	21
am	21
confused	21
just	21
now,	21
sirs,”	21
said	21
the	21
damsel,	21
“and	21
I	21
don’t	21
know	21
what	21
I	21
am	21
saying;	21
but	21
the	21
truth	21
is	21
that	21
I	21
am	21
the	21
daughter	21
of	21
Diego	21
de	21
la	21
Llana,	21
whom	21
you	21
must	21
all	21
know.”	21
“Ay,	21
that	21
will	21
do,”	21
said	21
the	21
majordomo;	21
“for	21
I	21
know	21
Diego	21
de	21
la	21
Llana,	21
and	21
know	21
that	21
he	21
is	21
a	21
gentleman	21
of	21
position	21
and	21
a	21
rich	21
man,	21
and	21
that	21
he	21
has	21
a	21
son	21
and	21
a	21
daughter,	21
and	21
that	21
since	21
he	21
was	21
left	21
a	21
widower	21
nobody	21
in	21
all	21
this	21
town	21
can	21
speak	21
of	21
having	21
seen	21
his	21
daughter’s	21
face;	21
for	21
he	21
keeps	21
her	21
so	21
closely	21
shut	21
up	21
that	21
he	21
does	21
not	21
give	21
even	21
the	21
sun	21
a	21
chance	21
of	21
seeing	21
her;	21
and	21
for	21
all	21
that	21
report	21
says	21
she	21
is	21
extremely	21
beautiful.”	21
“It	21
is	21
true,”	21
said	21
the	21
damsel,	21
“and	21
I	21
am	21
that	21
daughter;	21
whether	21
report	21
lies	21
or	21
not	21
as	21
to	21
my	21
beauty,	21
you,	21
sirs,	21
will	21
have	21
decided	21
by	21
this	21
time,	21
as	21
you	21
have	21
seen	21
me;”	21
and	21
with	21
this	21
she	21
began	21
to	21
weep	21
bitterly.	21
On	21
seeing	21
this	21
the	21
secretary	21
leant	21
over	21
to	21
the	21
head-carver’s	21
ear,	21
and	21
said	21
to	21
him	21
in	21
a	21
low	21
voice,	21
“Something	21
serious	21
has	21
no	21
doubt	21
happened	21
this	21
poor	21
maiden,	21
that	21
she	21
goes	21
wandering	21
from	21
home	21
in	21
such	21
a	21
dress	21
and	21
at	21
such	21
an	21
hour,	21
and	21
one	21
of	21
her	21
rank	21
too.”	21
“There	21
can	21
be	21
no	21
doubt	21
about	21
it,”	21
returned	21
the	21
carver,	21
“and	21
moreover	21
her	21
tears	21
confirm	21
your	21
suspicion.”	21
Sancho	21
gave	21
her	21
the	21
best	21
comfort	21
he	21
could,	21
and	21
entreated	21
her	21
to	21
tell	21
them	21
without	21
any	21
fear	21
what	21
had	21
happened	21
her,	21
as	21
they	21
would	21
all	21
earnestly	21
and	21
by	21
every	21
means	21
in	21
their	21
power	21
endeavour	21
to	21
relieve	21
her.	21
“The	21
fact	21
is,	21
sirs,”	21
said	21
she,	21
“that	21
my	21
father	21
has	21
kept	21
me	21
shut	21
up	21
these	21
ten	21
years,	21
for	21
so	21
long	21
is	21
it	21
since	21
the	21
earth	21
received	21
my	21
mother.	21
Mass	21
is	21
said	21
at	21
home	21
in	21
a	21
sumptuous	21
chapel,	21
and	21
all	21
this	21
time	21
I	21
have	21
seen	21
but	21
the	21
sun	21
in	21
the	21
heaven	21
by	21
day,	21
and	21
the	21
moon	21
and	21
the	21
stars	21
by	21
night;	21
nor	21
do	21
I	21
know	21
what	21
streets	21
are	21
like,	21
or	21
plazas,	21
or	21
churches,	21
or	21
even	21
men,	21
except	21
my	21
father	21
and	21
a	21
brother	21
I	21
have,	21
and	21
Pedro	21
Perez	21
the	21
wool-farmer;	21
whom,	21
because	21
he	21
came	21
frequently	21
to	21
our	21
house,	21
I	21
took	21
it	21
into	21
my	21
head	21
to	21
call	21
my	21
father,	21
to	21
avoid	21
naming	21
my	21
own.	21
This	21
seclusion	21
and	21
the	21
restrictions	21
laid	21
upon	21
my	21
going	21
out,	21
were	21
it	21
only	21
to	21
church,	21
have	21
been	21
keeping	21
me	21
unhappy	21
for	21
many	21
a	21
day	21
and	21
month	21
past;	21
I	21
longed	21
to	21
see	21
the	21
world,	21
or	21
at	21
least	21
the	21
town	21
where	21
I	21
was	21
born,	21
and	21
it	21
did	21
not	21
seem	21
to	21
me	21
that	21
this	21
wish	21
was	21
inconsistent	21
with	21
the	21
respect	21
maidens	21
of	21
good	21
quality	21
should	21
have	21
for	21
themselves.	21
When	21
I	21
heard	21
them	21
talking	21
of	21
bull-fights	21
taking	21
place,	21
and	21
of	21
javelin	21
games,	21
and	21
of	21
acting	21
plays,	21
I	21
asked	21
my	21
brother,	21
who	21
is	21
a	21
year	21
younger	21
than	21
myself,	21
to	21
tell	21
me	21
what	21
sort	21
of	21
things	21
these	21
were,	21
and	21
many	21
more	21
that	21
I	21
had	21
never	21
seen;	21
he	21
explained	21
them	21
to	21
me	21
as	21
well	21
as	21
he	21
could,	21
but	21
the	21
only	21
effect	21
was	21
to	21
kindle	21
in	21
me	21
a	21
still	21
stronger	21
desire	21
to	21
see	21
them.	21
At	21
last,	21
to	21
cut	21
short	21
the	21
story	21
of	21
my	21
ruin,	21
I	21
begged	21
and	21
entreated	21
my	21
brother—O	21
that	21
I	21
had	21
never	21
made	21
such	21
an	21
entreaty—”	21
And	21
once	21
more	21
she	21
gave	21
way	21
to	21
a	21
burst	21
of	21
weeping.	21
“Proceed,	21
señora,”	21
said	21
the	21
majordomo,	21
“and	21
finish	21
your	21
story	21
of	21
what	21
has	21
happened	21
to	21
you,	21
for	21
your	21
words	21
and	21
tears	21
are	21
keeping	21
us	21
all	21
in	21
suspense.”	21
“I	21
have	21
but	21
little	21
more	21
to	21
say,	21
though	21
many	21
a	21
tear	21
to	21
shed,”	21
said	21
the	21
damsel;	21
“for	21
ill-placed	21
desires	21
can	21
only	21
be	21
paid	21
for	21
in	21
some	21
such	21
way.”	21
The	21
maiden’s	21
beauty	21
had	21
made	21
a	21
deep	21
impression	21
on	21
the	21
head-carver’s	21
heart,	21
and	21
he	21
again	21
raised	21
his	21
lantern	21
for	21
another	21
look	21
at	21
her,	21
and	21
thought	21
they	21
were	21
not	21
tears	21
she	21
was	21
shedding,	21
but	21
seed-pearl	21
or	21
dew	21
of	21
the	21
meadow,	21
nay,	21
he	21
exalted	21
them	21
still	21
higher,	21
and	21
made	21
Oriental	21
pearls	21
of	21
them,	21
and	21
fervently	21
hoped	21
her	21
misfortune	21
might	21
not	21
be	21
so	21
great	21
a	21
one	21
as	21
her	21
tears	21
and	21
sobs	21
seemed	21
to	21
indicate.	21
The	21
governor	21
was	21
losing	21
patience	21
at	21
the	21
length	21
of	21
time	21
the	21
girl	21
was	21
taking	21
to	21
tell	21
her	21
story,	21
and	21
told	21
her	21
not	21
to	21
keep	21
them	21
waiting	21
any	21
longer;	21
for	21
it	21
was	21
late,	21
and	21
there	21
still	21
remained	21
a	21
good	21
deal	21
of	21
the	21
town	21
to	21
be	21
gone	21
over.	21
She,	21
with	21
broken	21
sobs	21
and	21
half-suppressed	21
sighs,	21
went	21
on	21
to	21
say,	21
“My	21
misfortune,	21
my	21
misadventure,	21
is	21
simply	21
this,	21
that	21
I	21
entreated	21
my	21
brother	21
to	21
dress	21
me	21
up	21
as	21
a	21
man	21
in	21
a	21
suit	21
of	21
his	21
clothes,	21
and	21
take	21
me	21
some	21
night,	21
when	21
our	21
father	21
was	21
asleep,	21
to	21
see	21
the	21
whole	21
town;	21
he,	21
overcome	21
by	21
my	21
entreaties,	21
consented,	21
and	21
dressing	21
me	21
in	21
this	21
suit	21
and	21
himself	21
in	21
clothes	21
of	21
mine	21
that	21
fitted	21
him	21
as	21
if	21
made	21
for	21
him	21
(for	21
he	21
has	21
not	21
a	21
hair	21
on	21
his	21
chin,	21
and	21
might	21
pass	21
for	21
a	21
very	21
beautiful	21
young	21
girl),	21
to-night,	21
about	21
an	21
hour	21
ago,	21
more	21
or	21
less,	21
we	21
left	21
the	21
house,	21
and	21
guided	21
by	21
our	21
youthful	21
and	21
foolish	21
impulse	21
we	21
made	21
the	21
circuit	21
of	21
the	21
whole	21
town,	21
and	21
then,	21
as	21
we	21
were	21
about	21
to	21
return	21
home,	21
we	21
saw	21
a	21
great	21
troop	21
of	21
people	21
coming,	21
and	21
my	21
brother	21
said	21
to	21
me,	21
‘Sister,	21
this	21
must	21
be	21
the	21
round,	21
stir	21
your	21
feet	21
and	21
put	21
wings	21
to	21
them,	21
and	21
follow	21
me	21
as	21
fast	21
as	21
you	21
can,	21
lest	21
they	21
recognise	21
us,	21
for	21
that	21
would	21
be	21
a	21
bad	21
business	21
for	21
us;’	21
and	21
so	21
saying	21
he	21
turned	21
about	21
and	21
began,	21
I	21
cannot	21
say	21
to	21
run	21
but	21
to	21
fly;	21
in	21
less	21
than	21
six	21
paces	21
I	21
fell	21
from	21
fright,	21
and	21
then	21
the	21
officer	21
of	21
justice	21
came	21
up	21
and	21
carried	21
me	21
before	21
your	21
worships,	21
where	21
I	21
find	21
myself	21
put	21
to	21
shame	21
before	21
all	21
these	21
people	21
as	21
whimsical	21
and	21
vicious.”	21
“So	21
then,	21
señora,”	21
said	21
Sancho,	21
“no	21
other	21
mishap	21
has	21
befallen	21
you,	21
nor	21
was	21
it	21
jealousy	21
that	21
made	21
you	21
leave	21
home,	21
as	21
you	21
said	21
at	21
the	21
beginning	21
of	21
your	21
story?”	21
“Nothing	21
has	21
happened	21
me,”	21
said	21
she,	21
“nor	21
was	21
it	21
jealousy	21
that	21
brought	21
me	21
out,	21
but	21
merely	21
a	21
longing	21
to	21
see	21
the	21
world,	21
which	21
did	21
not	21
go	21
beyond	21
seeing	21
the	21
streets	21
of	21
this	21
town.”	21
The	21
appearance	21
of	21
the	21
tipstaffs	21
with	21
her	21
brother	21
in	21
custody,	21
whom	21
one	21
of	21
them	21
had	21
overtaken	21
as	21
he	21
ran	21
away	21
from	21
his	21
sister,	21
now	21
fully	21
confirmed	21
the	21
truth	21
of	21
what	21
the	21
damsel	21
said.	21
He	21
had	21
nothing	21
on	21
but	21
a	21
rich	21
petticoat	21
and	21
a	21
short	21
blue	21
damask	21
cloak	21
with	21
fine	21
gold	21
lace,	21
and	21
his	21
head	21
was	21
uncovered	21
and	21
adorned	21
only	21
with	21
its	21
own	21
hair,	21
which	21
looked	21
like	21
rings	21
of	21
gold,	21
so	21
bright	21
and	21
curly	21
was	21
it.	21
The	21
governor,	21
the	21
majordomo,	21
and	21
the	21
carver	21
went	21
aside	21
with	21
him,	21
and,	21
unheard	21
by	21
his	21
sister,	21
asked	21
him	21
how	21
he	21
came	21
to	21
be	21
in	21
that	21
dress,	21
and	21
he	21
with	21
no	21
less	21
shame	21
and	21
embarrassment	21
told	21
exactly	21
the	21
same	21
story	21
as	21
his	21
sister,	21
to	21
the	21
great	21
delight	21
of	21
the	21
enamoured	21
carver;	21
the	21
governor,	21
however,	21
said	21
to	21
them,	21
“In	21
truth,	21
young	21
lady	21
and	21
gentleman,	21
this	21
has	21
been	21
a	21
very	21
childish	21
affair,	21
and	21
to	21
explain	21
your	21
folly	21
and	21
rashness	21
there	21
was	21
no	21
necessity	21
for	21
all	21
this	21
delay	21
and	21
all	21
these	21
tears	21
and	21
sighs;	21
for	21
if	21
you	21
had	21
said	21
we	21
are	21
so-and-so,	21
and	21
we	21
escaped	21
from	21
our	21
father’s	21
house	21
in	21
this	21
way	21
in	21
order	21
to	21
ramble	21
about,	21
out	21
of	21
mere	21
curiosity	21
and	21
with	21
no	21
other	21
object,	21
there	21
would	21
have	21
been	21
an	21
end	21
of	21
the	21
matter,	21
and	21
none	21
of	21
these	21
little	21
sobs	21
and	21
tears	21
and	21
all	21
the	21
rest	21
of	21
it.”	21
“That	21
is	21
true,”	21
said	21
the	21
damsel,	21
“but	21
you	21
see	21
the	21
confusion	21
I	21
was	21
in	21
was	21
so	21
great	21
it	21
did	21
not	21
let	21
me	21
behave	21
as	21
I	21
ought.”	21
“No	21
harm	21
has	21
been	21
done,”	21
said	21
Sancho;	21
“come,	21
we	21
will	21
leave	21
you	21
at	21
your	21
father’s	21
house;	21
perhaps	21
they	21
will	21
not	21
have	21
missed	21
you;	21
and	21
another	21
time	21
don’t	21
be	21
so	21
childish	21
or	21
eager	21
to	21
see	21
the	21
world;	21
for	21
a	21
respectable	21
damsel	21
should	21
have	21
a	21
broken	21
leg	21
and	21
keep	21
at	21
home;	21
and	21
the	21
woman	21
and	21
the	21
hen	21
by	21
gadding	21
about	21
are	21
soon	21
lost;	21
and	21
she	21
who	21
is	21
eager	21
to	21
see	21
is	21
also	21
eager	21
to	21
be	21
seen;	21
I	21
say	21
no	21
more.”	21
The	21
youth	21
thanked	21
the	21
governor	21
for	21
his	21
kind	21
offer	21
to	21
take	21
them	21
home,	21
and	21
they	21
directed	21
their	21
steps	21
towards	21
the	21
house,	21
which	21
was	21
not	21
far	21
off.	21
On	21
reaching	21
it	21
the	21
youth	21
threw	21
a	21
pebble	21
up	21
at	21
a	21
grating,	21
and	21
immediately	21
a	21
woman-servant	21
who	21
was	21
waiting	21
for	21
them	21
came	21
down	21
and	21
opened	21
the	21
door	21
to	21
them,	21
and	21
they	21
went	21
in,	21
leaving	21
the	21
party	21
marvelling	21
as	21
much	21
at	21
their	21
grace	21
and	21
beauty	21
as	21
at	21
the	21
fancy	21
they	21
had	21
for	21
seeing	21
the	21
world	21
by	21
night	21
and	21
without	21
quitting	21
the	21
village;	21
which,	21
however,	21
they	21
set	21
down	21
to	21
their	21
youth.	21
The	21
head-carver	21
was	21
left	21
with	21
a	21
heart	21
pierced	21
through	21
and	21
through,	21
and	21
he	21
made	21
up	21
his	21
mind	21
on	21
the	21
spot	21
to	21
demand	21
the	21
damsel	21
in	21
marriage	21
of	21
her	21
father	21
on	21
the	21
morrow,	21
making	21
sure	21
she	21
would	21
not	21
be	21
refused	21
him	21
as	21
he	21
was	21
a	21
servant	21
of	21
the	21
duke’s;	21
and	21
even	21
to	21
Sancho	21
ideas	21
and	21
schemes	21
of	21
marrying	21
the	21
youth	21
to	21
his	21
daughter	21
Sanchica	21
suggested	21
themselves,	21
and	21
he	21
resolved	21
to	21
open	21
the	21
negotiation	21
at	21
the	21
proper	21
season,	21
persuading	21
himself	21
that	21
no	21
husband	21
could	21
be	21
refused	21
to	21
a	21
governor’s	21
daughter.	21
And	21
so	21
the	21
night’s	21
round	21
came	21
to	21
an	21
end,	21
and	21
a	21
couple	21
of	21
days	21
later	21
the	21
government,	21
whereby	21
all	21
his	21
plans	21
were	21
overthrown	21
and	21
swept	21
away,	21
as	21
will	21
be	21
seen	21
farther	21
on.	21

Hamete,	21
the	21
painstaking	21
investigator	21
of	21
the	21
minute	21
points	21
of	21
this	21
veracious	21
history,	21
says	21
that	21
when	21
Doña	21
Rodriguez	21
left	21
her	21
own	21
room	21
to	21
go	21
to	21
Don	21
Quixote’s,	21
another	21
duenna	21
who	21
slept	21
with	21
her	21
observed	21
her,	21
and	21
as	21
all	21
duennas	21
are	21
fond	21
of	21
prying,	21
listening,	21
and	21
sniffing,	21
she	21
followed	21
her	21
so	21
silently	21
that	21
the	21
good	21
Rodriguez	21
never	21
perceived	21
it;	21
and	21
as	21
soon	21
as	21
the	21
duenna	21
saw	21
her	21
enter	21
Don	21
Quixote’s	21
room,	21
not	21
to	21
fail	21
in	21
a	21
duenna’s	21
invariable	21
practice	21
of	21
tattling,	21
she	21
hurried	21
off	21
that	21
instant	21
to	21
report	21
to	21
the	21
duchess	21
how	21
Doña	21
Rodriguez	21
was	21
closeted	21
with	21
Don	21
Quixote.	21
The	21
duchess	21
told	21
the	21
duke,	21
and	21
asked	21
him	21
to	21
let	21
her	21
and	21
Altisidora	21
go	21
and	21
see	21
what	21
the	21
said	21
duenna	21
wanted	21
with	21
Don	21
Quixote.	21
The	21
duke	21
gave	21
them	21
leave,	21
and	21
the	21
pair	21
cautiously	21
and	21
quietly	21
crept	21
to	21
the	21
door	21
of	21
the	21
room	21
and	21
posted	21
themselves	21
so	21
close	21
to	21
it	21
that	21
they	21
could	21
hear	21
all	21
that	21
was	21
said	21
inside.	21
But	21
when	21
the	21
duchess	21
heard	21
how	21
the	21
Rodriguez	21
had	21
made	21
public	21
the	21
Aranjuez	21
of	21
her	21
issues	21
she	21
could	21
not	21
restrain	21
herself,	21
nor	21
Altisidora	21
either;	21
and	21
so,	21
filled	21
with	21
rage	21
and	21
thirsting	21
for	21
vengeance,	21
they	21
burst	21
into	21
the	21
room	21
and	21
tormented	21
Don	21
Quixote	21
and	21
flogged	21
the	21
duenna	21
in	21
the	21
manner	21
already	21
described;	21
for	21
indignities	21
offered	21
to	21
their	21
charms	21
and	21
self-esteem	21
mightily	21
provoke	21
the	21
anger	21
of	21
women	21
and	21
make	21
them	21
eager	21
for	21
revenge.	21
The	21
duchess	21
told	21
the	21
duke	21
what	21
had	21
happened,	21
and	21
he	21
was	21
much	21
amused	21
by	21
it;	21
and	21
she,	21
in	21
pursuance	21
of	21
her	21
design	21
of	21
making	21
merry	21
and	21
diverting	21
herself	21
with	21
Don	21
Quixote,	21
despatched	21
the	21
page	21
who	21
had	21
played	21
the	21
part	21
of	21
Dulcinea	21
in	21
the	21
negotiations	21
for	21
her	21
disenchantment	21
(which	21
Sancho	21
Panza	21
in	21
the	21
cares	21
of	21
government	21
had	21
forgotten	21
all	21
about)	21
to	21
Teresa	21
Panza	21
his	21
wife	21
with	21
her	21
husband’s	21
letter	21
and	21
another	21
from	21
herself,	21
and	21
also	21
a	21
great	21
string	21
of	21
fine	21
coral	21
beads	21
as	21
a	21
present.	21
Now	21
the	21
history	21
says	21
this	21
page	21
was	21
very	21
sharp	21
and	21
quick-witted;	21
and	21
eager	21
to	21
serve	21
his	21
lord	21
and	21
lady	21
he	21
set	21
off	21
very	21
willingly	21
for	21
Sancho’s	21
village.	21
Before	21
he	21
entered	21
it	21
he	21
observed	21
a	21
number	21
of	21
women	21
washing	21
in	21
a	21
brook,	21
and	21
asked	21
them	21
if	21
they	21
could	21
tell	21
him	21
whether	21
there	21
lived	21
there	21
a	21
woman	21
of	21
the	21
name	21
of	21
Teresa	21
Panza,	21
wife	21
of	21
one	21
Sancho	21
Panza,	21
squire	21
to	21
a	21
knight	21
called	21
Don	21
Quixote	21
of	21
La	21
Mancha.	21
At	21
the	21
question	21
a	21
young	21
girl	21
who	21
was	21
washing	21
stood	21
up	21
and	21
said,	21
“Teresa	21
Panza	21
is	21
my	21
mother,	21
and	21
that	21
Sancho	21
is	21
my	21
father,	21
and	21
that	21
knight	21
is	21
our	21
master.”	21
“Well	21
then,	21
miss,”	21
said	21
the	21
page,	21
“come	21
and	21
show	21
me	21
where	21
your	21
mother	21
is,	21
for	21
I	21
bring	21
her	21
a	21
letter	21
and	21
a	21
present	21
from	21
your	21
father.”	21
“That	21
I	21
will	21
with	21
all	21
my	21
heart,	21
señor,”	21
said	21
the	21
girl,	21
who	21
seemed	21
to	21
be	21
about	21
fourteen,	21
more	21
or	21
less;	21
and	21
leaving	21
the	21
clothes	21
she	21
was	21
washing	21
to	21
one	21
of	21
her	21
companions,	21
and	21
without	21
putting	21
anything	21
on	21
her	21
head	21
or	21
feet,	21
for	21
she	21
was	21
bare-legged	21
and	21
had	21
her	21
hair	21
hanging	21
about	21
her,	21
away	21
she	21
skipped	21
in	21
front	21
of	21
the	21
page’s	21
horse,	21
saying,	21
“Come,	21
your	21
worship,	21
our	21
house	21
is	21
at	21
the	21
entrance	21
of	21
the	21
town,	21
and	21
my	21
mother	21
is	21
there,	21
sorrowful	21
enough	21
at	21
not	21
having	21
had	21
any	21
news	21
of	21
my	21
father	21
this	21
ever	21
so	21
long.”	21
“Well,”	21
said	21
the	21
page,	21
“I	21
am	21
bringing	21
her	21
such	21
good	21
news	21
that	21
she	21
will	21
have	21
reason	21
to	21
thank	21
God.”	21
And	21
then,	21
skipping,	21
running,	21
and	21
capering,	21
the	21
girl	21
reached	21
the	21
town,	21
but	21
before	21
going	21
into	21
the	21
house	21
she	21
called	21
out	21
at	21
the	21
door,	21
“Come	21
out,	21
mother	21
Teresa,	21
come	21
out,	21
come	21
out;	21
here’s	21
a	21
gentleman	21
with	21
letters	21
and	21
other	21
things	21
from	21
my	21
good	21
father.”	21
At	21
these	21
words	21
her	21
mother	21
Teresa	21
Panza	21
came	21
out	21
spinning	21
a	21
bundle	21
of	21
flax,	21
in	21
a	21
grey	21
petticoat	21
(so	21
short	21
was	21
it	21
one	21
would	21
have	21
fancied	21
“they	21
to	21
her	21
shame	21
had	21
cut	21
it	21
short”),	21
a	21
grey	21
bodice	21
of	21
the	21
same	21
stuff,	21
and	21
a	21
smock.	21
She	21
was	21
not	21
very	21
old,	21
though	21
plainly	21
past	21
forty,	21
strong,	21
healthy,	21
vigorous,	21
and	21
sun-dried;	21
and	21
seeing	21
her	21
daughter	21
and	21
the	21
page	21
on	21
horseback,	21
she	21
exclaimed,	21
“What’s	21
this,	21
child?	21
What	21
gentleman	21
is	21
this?”	21
“A	21
servant	21
of	21
my	21
lady,	21
Doña	21
Teresa	21
Panza,”	21
replied	21
the	21
page;	21
and	21
suiting	21
the	21
action	21
to	21
the	21
word	21
he	21
flung	21
himself	21
off	21
his	21
horse,	21
and	21
with	21
great	21
humility	21
advanced	21
to	21
kneel	21
before	21
the	21
lady	21
Teresa,	21
saying,	21
“Let	21
me	21
kiss	21
your	21
hand,	21
Señora	21
Doña	21
Teresa,	21
as	21
the	21
lawful	21
and	21
only	21
wife	21
of	21
Señor	21
Don	21
Sancho	21
Panza,	21
rightful	21
governor	21
of	21
the	21
island	21
of	21
Barataria.”	21
“Ah,	21
señor,	21
get	21
up,	21
do	21
that,”	21
said	21
Teresa;	21
“for	21
I’m	21
not	21
a	21
bit	21
of	21
a	21
court	21
lady,	21
but	21
only	21
a	21
poor	21
country	21
woman,	21
the	21
daughter	21
of	21
a	21
clodcrusher,	21
and	21
the	21
wife	21
of	21
a	21
squire-errant	21
and	21
not	21
of	21
any	21
governor	21
at	21
all.”	21
“You	21
are,”	21
said	21
the	21
page,	21
“the	21
most	21
worthy	21
wife	21
of	21
a	21
most	21
arch-worthy	21
governor;	21
and	21
as	21
a	21
proof	21
of	21
what	21
I	21
say	21
accept	21
this	21
letter	21
and	21
this	21
present;”	21
and	21
at	21
the	21
same	21
time	21
he	21
took	21
out	21
of	21
his	21
pocket	21
a	21
string	21
of	21
coral	21
beads	21
with	21
gold	21
clasps,	21
and	21
placed	21
it	21
on	21
her	21
neck,	21
and	21
said,	21
“This	21
letter	21
is	21
from	21
his	21
lordship	21
the	21
governor,	21
and	21
the	21
other	21
as	21
well	21
as	21
these	21
coral	21
beads	21
from	21
my	21
lady	21
the	21
duchess,	21
who	21
sends	21
me	21
to	21
your	21
worship.”	21
Teresa	21
stood	21
lost	21
in	21
astonishment,	21
and	21
her	21
daughter	21
just	21
as	21
much,	21
and	21
the	21
girl	21
said,	21
“May	21
I	21
die	21
but	21
our	21
master	21
Don	21
Quixote’s	21
at	21
the	21
bottom	21
of	21
this;	21
he	21
must	21
have	21
given	21
father	21
the	21
government	21
or	21
county	21
he	21
so	21
often	21
promised	21
him.”	21
“That	21
is	21
the	21
truth,”	21
said	21
the	21
page;	21
“for	21
it	21
is	21
through	21
Señor	21
Don	21
Quixote	21
that	21
Señor	21
Sancho	21
is	21
now	21
governor	21
of	21
the	21
island	21
of	21
Barataria,	21
as	21
will	21
be	21
seen	21
by	21
this	21
letter.”	21
“Will	21
your	21
worship	21
read	21
it	21
to	21
me,	21
noble	21
sir?”	21
said	21
Teresa;	21
“for	21
though	21
I	21
can	21
spin	21
I	21
can’t	21
read,	21
not	21
a	21
scrap.”	21
“Nor	21
I	21
either,”	21
said	21
Sanchica;	21
“but	21
wait	21
a	21
bit,	21
and	21
I’ll	21
go	21
and	21
fetch	21
someone	21
who	21
can	21
read	21
it,	21
either	21
the	21
curate	21
himself	21
or	21
the	21
bachelor	21
Samson	21
Carrasco,	21
and	21
they’ll	21
come	21
gladly	21
to	21
hear	21
any	21
news	21
of	21
my	21
father.”	21
“There	21
is	21
no	21
need	21
to	21
fetch	21
anybody,”	21
said	21
the	21
page;	21
“for	21
though	21
I	21
can’t	21
spin	21
I	21
can	21
read,	21
and	21
I’ll	21
read	21
it;”	21
and	21
so	21
he	21
read	21
it	21
through,	21
but	21
as	21
it	21
has	21
been	21
already	21
given	21
it	21
is	21
not	21
inserted	21
here;	21
and	21
then	21
he	21
took	21
out	21
the	21
other	21
one	21
from	21
the	21
duchess,	21
which	21
ran	21
as	21
follows:	21
Friend	21
Teresa,—Your	21
husband	21
Sancho’s	21
good	21
qualities,	21
of	21
heart	21
as	21
well	21
as	21
of	21
head,	21
induced	21
and	21
compelled	21
me	21
to	21
request	21
my	21
husband	21
the	21
duke	21
to	21
give	21
him	21
the	21
government	21
of	21
one	21
of	21
his	21
many	21
islands.	21
I	21
am	21
told	21
he	21
governs	21
like	21
a	21
gerfalcon,	21
of	21
which	21
I	21
am	21
very	21
glad,	21
and	21
my	21
lord	21
the	21
duke,	21
of	21
course,	21
also;	21
and	21
I	21
am	21
very	21
thankful	21
to	21
heaven	21
that	21
I	21
have	21
not	21
made	21
a	21
mistake	21
in	21
choosing	21
him	21
for	21
that	21
same	21
government;	21
for	21
I	21
would	21
have	21
Señora	21
Teresa	21
know	21
that	21
a	21
good	21
governor	21
is	21
hard	21
to	21
find	21
in	21
this	21
world	21
and	21
may	21
God	21
make	21
me	21
as	21
good	21
as	21
Sancho’s	21
way	21
of	21
governing.	21
Herewith	21
I	21
send	21
you,	21
my	21
dear,	21
a	21
string	21
of	21
coral	21
beads	21
with	21
gold	21
clasps;	21
I	21
wish	21
they	21
were	21
Oriental	21
pearls;	21
but	21
“he	21
who	21
gives	21
thee	21
a	21
bone	21
does	21
not	21
wish	21
to	21
see	21
thee	21
dead;”	21
a	21
time	21
will	21
come	21
when	21
we	21
shall	21
become	21
acquainted	21
and	21
meet	21
one	21
another,	21
but	21
God	21
knows	21
the	21
future.	21
Commend	21
me	21
to	21
your	21
daughter	21
Sanchica,	21
and	21
tell	21
her	21
from	21
me	21
to	21
hold	21
herself	21
in	21
readiness,	21
for	21
I	21
mean	21
to	21
make	21
a	21
high	21
match	21
for	21
her	21
when	21
she	21
least	21
expects	21
it.	21
They	21
tell	21
me	21
there	21
are	21
big	21
acorns	21
in	21
your	21
village;	21
send	21
me	21
a	21
couple	21
of	21
dozen	21
or	21
so,	21
and	21
I	21
shall	21
value	21
them	21
greatly	21
as	21
coming	21
from	21
your	21
hand;	21
and	21
write	21
to	21
me	21
at	21
length	21
to	21
assure	21
me	21
of	21
your	21
health	21
and	21
well-being;	21
and	21
if	21
there	21
be	21
anything	21
you	21
stand	21
in	21
need	21
of,	21
it	21
is	21
but	21
to	21
open	21
your	21
mouth,	21
and	21
that	21
shall	21
be	21
the	21
measure;	21
and	21
so	21
God	21
keep	21
you.	21
From	21
this	21
place.	21
Your	21
loving	21
friend,	21
THE	21
DUCHESS.	21
“Ah,	21
what	21
a	21
good,	21
plain,	21
lowly	21
lady!”	21
said	21
Teresa	21
when	21
she	21
heard	21
the	21
letter;	21
“that	21
I	21
may	21
be	21
buried	21
with	21
ladies	21
of	21
that	21
sort,	21
and	21
not	21
the	21
gentlewomen	21
we	21
have	21
in	21
this	21
town,	21
that	21
fancy	21
because	21
they	21
are	21
gentlewomen	21
the	21
wind	21
must	21
not	21
touch	21
them,	21
and	21
go	21
to	21
church	21
with	21
as	21
much	21
airs	21
as	21
if	21
they	21
were	21
queens,	21
no	21
less,	21
and	21
seem	21
to	21
think	21
they	21
are	21
disgraced	21
if	21
they	21
look	21
at	21
a	21
farmer’s	21
wife!	21
And	21
see	21
here	21
how	21
this	21
good	21
lady,	21
for	21
all	21
she’s	21
a	21
duchess,	21
calls	21
me	21
‘friend,’	21
and	21
treats	21
me	21
as	21
if	21
I	21
was	21
her	21
equal—and	21
equal	21
may	21
I	21
see	21
her	21
with	21
the	21
tallest	21
church-tower	21
in	21
La	21
Mancha!	21
And	21
as	21
for	21
the	21
acorns,	21
señor,	21
I’ll	21
send	21
her	21
ladyship	21
a	21
peck	21
and	21
such	21
big	21
ones	21
that	21
one	21
might	21
come	21
to	21
see	21
them	21
as	21
a	21
show	21
and	21
a	21
wonder.	21
And	21
now,	21
Sanchica,	21
see	21
that	21
the	21
gentleman	21
is	21
comfortable;	21
put	21
up	21
his	21
horse,	21
and	21
get	21
some	21
eggs	21
out	21
of	21
the	21
stable,	21
and	21
cut	21
plenty	21
of	21
bacon,	21
and	21
let’s	21
give	21
him	21
his	21
dinner	21
like	21
a	21
prince;	21
for	21
the	21
good	21
news	21
he	21
has	21
brought,	21
and	21
his	21
own	21
bonny	21
face	21
deserve	21
it	21
all;	21
and	21
meanwhile	21
I’ll	21
run	21
out	21
and	21
give	21
the	21
neighbours	21
the	21
news	21
of	21
our	21
good	21
luck,	21
and	21
father	21
curate,	21
and	21
Master	21
Nicholas	21
the	21
barber,	21
who	21
are	21
and	21
always	21
have	21
been	21
such	21
friends	21
of	21
thy	21
father’s.”	21
“That	21
I	21
will,	21
mother,”	21
said	21
Sanchica;	21
“but	21
mind,	21
you	21
must	21
give	21
me	21
half	21
of	21
that	21
string;	21
for	21
I	21
don’t	21
think	21
my	21
lady	21
the	21
duchess	21
could	21
have	21
been	21
so	21
stupid	21
as	21
to	21
send	21
it	21
all	21
to	21
you.”	21
“It	21
is	21
all	21
for	21
thee,	21
my	21
child,”	21
said	21
Teresa;	21
“but	21
let	21
me	21
wear	21
it	21
round	21
my	21
neck	21
for	21
a	21
few	21
days;	21
for	21
verily	21
it	21
seems	21
to	21
make	21
my	21
heart	21
glad.”	21
“You	21
will	21
be	21
glad	21
too,”	21
said	21
the	21
page,	21
“when	21
you	21
see	21
the	21
bundle	21
there	21
is	21
in	21
this	21
portmanteau,	21
for	21
it	21
is	21
a	21
suit	21
of	21
the	21
finest	21
cloth,	21
that	21
the	21
governor	21
only	21
wore	21
one	21
day	21
out	21
hunting	21
and	21
now	21
sends,	21
all	21
for	21
Señora	21
Sanchica.”	21
“May	21
he	21
live	21
a	21
thousand	21
years,”	21
said	21
Sanchica,	21
“and	21
the	21
bearer	21
as	21
many,	21
nay	21
two	21
thousand,	21
if	21
needful.”	21
With	21
this	21
Teresa	21
hurried	21
out	21
of	21
the	21
house	21
with	21
the	21
letters,	21
and	21
with	21
the	21
string	21
of	21
beads	21
round	21
her	21
neck,	21
and	21
went	21
along	21
thrumming	21
the	21
letters	21
as	21
if	21
they	21
were	21
a	21
tambourine,	21
and	21
by	21
chance	21
coming	21
across	21
the	21
curate	21
and	21
Samson	21
Carrasco	21
she	21
began	21
capering	21
and	21
saying,	21
“None	21
of	21
us	21
poor	21
now,	21
faith!	21
We’ve	21
got	21
a	21
little	21
government!	21
Ay,	21
let	21
the	21
finest	21
fine	21
lady	21
tackle	21
me,	21
and	21
I’ll	21
give	21
her	21
a	21
setting	21
down!”	21
“What’s	21
all	21
this,	21
Teresa	21
Panza,”	21
said	21
they;	21
“what	21
madness	21
is	21
this,	21
and	21
what	21
papers	21
are	21
those?”	21
“The	21
madness	21
is	21
only	21
this,”	21
said	21
she,	21
“that	21
these	21
are	21
the	21
letters	21
of	21
duchesses	21
and	21
governors,	21
and	21
these	21
I	21
have	21
on	21
my	21
neck	21
are	21
fine	21
coral	21
beads,	21
with	21
ave-marias	21
and	21
paternosters	21
of	21
beaten	21
gold,	21
and	21
I	21
am	21
a	21
governess.”	21
“God	21
help	21
us,”	21
said	21
the	21
curate,	21
“we	21
don’t	21
understand	21
you,	21
Teresa,	21
or	21
know	21
what	21
you	21
are	21
talking	21
about.”	21
“There,	21
you	21
may	21
see	21
it	21
yourselves,”	21
said	21
Teresa,	21
and	21
she	21
handed	21
them	21
the	21
letters.	21
The	21
curate	21
read	21
them	21
out	21
for	21
Samson	21
Carrasco	21
to	21
hear,	21
and	21
Samson	21
and	21
he	21
regarded	21
one	21
another	21
with	21
looks	21
of	21
astonishment	21
at	21
what	21
they	21
had	21
read,	21
and	21
the	21
bachelor	21
asked	21
who	21
had	21
brought	21
the	21
letters.	21
Teresa	21
in	21
reply	21
bade	21
them	21
come	21
with	21
her	21
to	21
her	21
house	21
and	21
they	21
would	21
see	21
the	21
messenger,	21
a	21
most	21
elegant	21
youth,	21
who	21
had	21
brought	21
another	21
present	21
which	21
was	21
worth	21
as	21
much	21
more.	21
The	21
curate	21
took	21
the	21
coral	21
beads	21
from	21
her	21
neck	21
and	21
examined	21
them	21
again	21
and	21
again,	21
and	21
having	21
satisfied	21
himself	21
as	21
to	21
their	21
fineness	21
he	21
fell	21
to	21
wondering	21
afresh,	21
and	21
said,	21
“By	21
the	21
gown	21
I	21
wear	21
I	21
don’t	21
know	21
what	21
to	21
say	21
or	21
think	21
of	21
these	21
letters	21
and	21
presents;	21
on	21
the	21
one	21
hand	21
I	21
can	21
see	21
and	21
feel	21
the	21
fineness	21
of	21
these	21
coral	21
beads,	21
and	21
on	21
the	21
other	21
I	21
read	21
how	21
a	21
duchess	21
sends	21
to	21
beg	21
for	21
a	21
couple	21
of	21
dozen	21
of	21
acorns.”	21
“Square	21
that	21
if	21
you	21
can,”	21
said	21
Carrasco;	21
“well,	21
let’s	21
go	21
and	21
see	21
the	21
messenger,	21
and	21
from	21
him	21
we’ll	21
learn	21
something	21
about	21
this	21
mystery	21
that	21
has	21
turned	21
up.”	21
They	21
did	21
so,	21
and	21
Teresa	21
returned	21
with	21
them.	21
They	21
found	21
the	21
page	21
sifting	21
a	21
little	21
barley	21
for	21
his	21
horse,	21
and	21
Sanchica	21
cutting	21
a	21
rasher	21
of	21
bacon	21
to	21
be	21
paved	21
with	21
eggs	21
for	21
his	21
dinner.	21
His	21
looks	21
and	21
his	21
handsome	21
apparel	21
pleased	21
them	21
both	21
greatly;	21
and	21
after	21
they	21
had	21
saluted	21
him	21
courteously,	21
and	21
he	21
them,	21
Samson	21
begged	21
him	21
to	21
give	21
them	21
his	21
news,	21
as	21
well	21
of	21
Don	21
Quixote	21
as	21
of	21
Sancho	21
Panza,	21
for,	21
he	21
said,	21
though	21
they	21
had	21
read	21
the	21
letters	21
from	21
Sancho	21
and	21
her	21
ladyship	21
the	21
duchess,	21
they	21
were	21
still	21
puzzled	21
and	21
could	21
not	21
make	21
out	21
what	21
was	21
meant	21
by	21
Sancho’s	21
government,	21
and	21
above	21
all	21
of	21
an	21
island,	21
when	21
all	21
or	21
most	21
of	21
those	21
in	21
the	21
Mediterranean	21
belonged	21
to	21
his	21
Majesty.	21
To	21
this	21
the	21
page	21
replied,	21
“As	21
to	21
Señor	21
Sancho	21
Panza’s	21
being	21
a	21
governor	21
there	21
is	21
no	21
doubt	21
whatever;	21
but	21
whether	21
it	21
is	21
an	21
island	21
or	21
not	21
that	21
he	21
governs,	21
with	21
that	21
I	21
have	21
nothing	21
to	21
do;	21
suffice	21
it	21
that	21
it	21
is	21
a	21
town	21
of	21
more	21
than	21
a	21
thousand	21
inhabitants;	21
with	21
regard	21
to	21
the	21
acorns	21
I	21
may	21
tell	21
you	21
my	21
lady	21
the	21
duchess	21
is	21
so	21
unpretending	21
and	21
unassuming	21
that,	21
not	21
to	21
speak	21
of	21
sending	21
to	21
beg	21
for	21
acorns	21
from	21
a	21
peasant	21
woman,	21
she	21
has	21
been	21
known	21
to	21
send	21
to	21
ask	21
for	21
the	21
loan	21
of	21
a	21
comb	21
from	21
one	21
of	21
her	21
neighbours;	21
for	21
I	21
would	21
have	21
your	21
worships	21
know	21
that	21
the	21
ladies	21
of	21
Aragon,	21
though	21
they	21
are	21
just	21
as	21
illustrious,	21
are	21
not	21
so	21
punctilious	21
and	21
haughty	21
as	21
the	21
Castilian	21
ladies;	21
they	21
treat	21
people	21
with	21
greater	21
familiarity.”	21
In	21
the	21
middle	21
of	21
this	21
conversation	21
Sanchica	21
came	21
in	21
with	21
her	21
skirt	21
full	21
of	21
eggs,	21
and	21
said	21
she	21
to	21
the	21
page,	21
“Tell	21
me,	21
señor,	21
does	21
my	21
father	21
wear	21
trunk-hose	21
since	21
he	21
has	21
been	21
governor?”	21
“I	21
have	21
not	21
noticed,”	21
said	21
the	21
page;	21
“but	21
no	21
doubt	21
he	21
wears	21
them.”	21
“Ah!	21
my	21
God!”	21
said	21
Sanchica,	21
“what	21
a	21
sight	21
it	21
must	21
be	21
to	21
see	21
my	21
father	21
in	21
tights!	21
Isn’t	21
it	21
odd	21
that	21
ever	21
since	21
I	21
was	21
born	21
I	21
have	21
had	21
a	21
longing	21
to	21
see	21
my	21
father	21
in	21
trunk-hose?”	21
“As	21
things	21
go	21
you	21
will	21
see	21
that	21
if	21
you	21
live,”	21
said	21
the	21
page;	21
“by	21
God	21
he	21
is	21
in	21
the	21
way	21
to	21
take	21
the	21
road	21
with	21
a	21
sunshade	21
if	21
the	21
government	21
only	21
lasts	21
him	21
two	21
months	21
more.”	21
The	21
curate	21
and	21
the	21
bachelor	21
could	21
see	21
plainly	21
enough	21
that	21
the	21
page	21
spoke	21
in	21
a	21
waggish	21
vein;	21
but	21
the	21
fineness	21
of	21
the	21
coral	21
beads,	21
and	21
the	21
hunting	21
suit	21
that	21
Sancho	21
sent	21
(for	21
Teresa	21
had	21
already	21
shown	21
it	21
to	21
them)	21
did	21
away	21
with	21
the	21
impression;	21
and	21
they	21
could	21
not	21
help	21
laughing	21
at	21
Sanchica’s	21
wish,	21
and	21
still	21
more	21
when	21
Teresa	21
said,	21
“Señor	21
curate,	21
look	21
about	21
if	21
there’s	21
anybody	21
here	21
going	21
to	21
Madrid	21
or	21
Toledo,	21
to	21
buy	21
me	21
a	21
hooped	21
petticoat,	21
a	21
proper	21
fashionable	21
one	21
of	21
the	21
best	21
quality;	21
for	21
indeed	21
and	21
indeed	21
I	21
must	21
do	21
honour	21
to	21
my	21
husband’s	21
government	21
as	21
well	21
as	21
I	21
can;	21
nay,	21
if	21
I	21
am	21
put	21
to	21
it	21
and	21
have	21
to,	21
I’ll	21
go	21
to	21
Court	21
and	21
set	21
a	21
coach	21
like	21
all	21
the	21
world;	21
for	21
she	21
who	21
has	21
a	21
governor	21
for	21
her	21
husband	21
may	21
very	21
well	21
have	21
one	21
and	21
keep	21
one.”	21
“And	21
why	21
not,	21
mother!”	21
said	21
Sanchica;	21
“would	21
to	21
God	21
it	21
were	21
to-day	21
instead	21
of	21
to-morrow,	21
even	21
though	21
they	21
were	21
to	21
say	21
when	21
they	21
saw	21
me	21
seated	21
in	21
the	21
coach	21
with	21
my	21
mother,	21
‘See	21
that	21
rubbish,	21
that	21
garlic-stuffed	21
fellow’s	21
daughter,	21
how	21
she	21
goes	21
stretched	21
at	21
her	21
ease	21
in	21
a	21
coach	21
as	21
if	21
she	21
was	21
a	21
she-pope!’	21
But	21
let	21
them	21
tramp	21
through	21
the	21
mud,	21
and	21
let	21
me	21
go	21
in	21
my	21
coach	21
with	21
my	21
feet	21
off	21
the	21
ground.	21
Bad	21
luck	21
to	21
backbiters	21
all	21
over	21
the	21
world;	21
‘let	21
me	21
go	21
warm	21
and	21
the	21
people	21
may	21
laugh.’	21
Do	21
I	21
say	21
right,	21
mother?”	21
“To	21
be	21
sure	21
you	21
do,	21
my	21
child,”	21
said	21
Teresa;	21
“and	21
all	21
this	21
good	21
luck,	21
and	21
even	21
more,	21
my	21
good	21
Sancho	21
foretold	21
me;	21
and	21
thou	21
wilt	21
see,	21
my	21
daughter,	21
he	21
won’t	21
stop	21
till	21
he	21
has	21
made	21
me	21
a	21
countess;	21
for	21
to	21
make	21
a	21
beginning	21
is	21
everything	21
in	21
luck;	21
and	21
as	21
I	21
have	21
heard	21
thy	21
good	21
father	21
say	21
many	21
a	21
time	21
(for	21
besides	21
being	21
thy	21
father	21
he’s	21
the	21
father	21
of	21
proverbs	21
too),	21
‘When	21
they	21
offer	21
thee	21
a	21
heifer,	21
run	21
with	21
a	21
halter;	21
when	21
they	21
offer	21
thee	21
a	21
government,	21
take	21
it;	21
when	21
they	21
would	21
give	21
thee	21
a	21
county,	21
seize	21
it;	21
when	21
they	21
say,	21
“Here,	21
here!”	21
to	21
thee	21
with	21
something	21
good,	21
swallow	21
it.’	21
Oh	21
no!	21
go	21
to	21
sleep,	21
and	21
don’t	21
answer	21
the	21
strokes	21
of	21
good	21
fortune	21
and	21
the	21
lucky	21
chances	21
that	21
are	21
knocking	21
at	21
the	21
door	21
of	21
your	21
house!”	21
“And	21
what	21
do	21
I	21
care,”	21
added	21
Sanchica,	21
“whether	21
anybody	21
says	21
when	21
he	21
sees	21
me	21
holding	21
my	21
head	21
up,	21
‘The	21
dog	21
saw	21
himself	21
in	21
hempen	21
breeches,’	21
and	21
the	21
rest	21
of	21
it?”	21
Hearing	21
this	21
the	21
curate	21
said,	21
“I	21
do	21
believe	21
that	21
all	21
this	21
family	21
of	21
the	21
Panzas	21
are	21
born	21
with	21
a	21
sackful	21
of	21
proverbs	21
in	21
their	21
insides,	21
every	21
one	21
of	21
them;	21
I	21
never	21
saw	21
one	21
of	21
them	21
that	21
does	21
not	21
pour	21
them	21
out	21
at	21
all	21
times	21
and	21
on	21
all	21
occasions.”	21
“That	21
is	21
true,”	21
said	21
the	21
page,	21
“for	21
Señor	21
Governor	21
Sancho	21
utters	21
them	21
at	21
every	21
turn;	21
and	21
though	21
a	21
great	21
many	21
of	21
them	21
are	21
not	21
to	21
the	21
purpose,	21
still	21
they	21
amuse	21
one,	21
and	21
my	21
lady	21
the	21
duchess	21
and	21
the	21
duke	21
praise	21
them	21
highly.”	21
“Then	21
you	21
still	21
maintain	21
that	21
all	21
this	21
about	21
Sancho’s	21
government	21
is	21
true,	21
señor,”	21
said	21
the	21
bachelor,	21
“and	21
that	21
there	21
actually	21
is	21
a	21
duchess	21
who	21
sends	21
him	21
presents	21
and	21
writes	21
to	21
him?	21
Because	21
we,	21
although	21
we	21
have	21
handled	21
the	21
present	21
and	21
read	21
the	21
letters,	21
don’t	21
believe	21
it	21
and	21
suspect	21
it	21
to	21
be	21
something	21
in	21
the	21
line	21
of	21
our	21
fellow-townsman	21
Don	21
Quixote,	21
who	21
fancies	21
that	21
everything	21
is	21
done	21
by	21
enchantment;	21
and	21
for	21
this	21
reason	21
I	21
am	21
almost	21
ready	21
to	21
say	21
that	21
I’d	21
like	21
to	21
touch	21
and	21
feel	21
your	21
worship	21
to	21
see	21
whether	21
you	21
are	21
a	21
mere	21
ambassador	21
of	21
the	21
imagination	21
or	21
a	21
man	21
of	21
flesh	21
and	21
blood.”	21
“All	21
I	21
know,	21
sirs,”	21
replied	21
the	21
page,	21
“is	21
that	21
I	21
am	21
a	21
real	21
ambassador,	21
and	21
that	21
Señor	21
Sancho	21
Panza	21
is	21
governor	21
as	21
a	21
matter	21
of	21
fact,	21
and	21
that	21
my	21
lord	21
and	21
lady	21
the	21
duke	21
and	21
duchess	21
can	21
give,	21
and	21
have	21
given	21
him	21
this	21
same	21
government,	21
and	21
that	21
I	21
have	21
heard	21
it	21
said	21
Sancho	21
Panza	21
bears	21
himself	21
very	21
stoutly	21
therein;	21
whether	21
there	21
be	21
any	21
enchantment	21
in	21
all	21
this	21
or	21
not,	21
it	21
is	21
for	21
your	21
worships	21
to	21
settle	21
between	21
you;	21
for	21
that’s	21
all	21
I	21
know	21
by	21
the	21
oath	21
I	21
swear,	21
and	21
that	21
is	21
by	21
the	21
life	21
of	21
my	21
parents	21
whom	21
I	21
have	21
still	21
alive,	21
and	21
love	21
dearly.”	21
“It	21
may	21
be	21
so,”	21
said	21
the	21
bachelor;	21
“but	21
_dubitat	21
Augustinus_.”	21
“Doubt	21
who	21
will,”	21
said	21
the	21
page;	21
“what	21
I	21
have	21
told	21
you	21
is	21
the	21
truth,	21
and	21
that	21
will	21
always	21
rise	21
above	21
falsehood	21
as	21
oil	21
above	21
water;	21
if	21
not	21
_operibus	21
credite,	21
et	21
non	21
verbis_.	21
Let	21
one	21
of	21
you	21
come	21
with	21
me,	21
and	21
he	21
will	21
see	21
with	21
his	21
eyes	21
what	21
he	21
does	21
not	21
believe	21
with	21
his	21
ears.”	21
“It’s	21
for	21
me	21
to	21
make	21
that	21
trip,”	21
said	21
Sanchica;	21
“take	21
me	21
with	21
you,	21
señor,	21
behind	21
you	21
on	21
your	21
horse;	21
for	21
I’ll	21
go	21
with	21
all	21
my	21
heart	21
to	21
see	21
my	21
father.”	21
“Governors’	21
daughters,”	21
said	21
the	21
page,	21
“must	21
not	21
travel	21
along	21
the	21
roads	21
alone,	21
but	21
accompanied	21
by	21
coaches	21
and	21
litters	21
and	21
a	21
great	21
number	21
of	21
attendants.”	21
“By	21
God,”	21
said	21
Sanchica,	21
“I	21
can	21
go	21
just	21
as	21
well	21
mounted	21
on	21
a	21
she-ass	21
as	21
in	21
a	21
coach;	21
what	21
a	21
dainty	21
lass	21
you	21
must	21
take	21
me	21
for!”	21
“Hush,	21
girl,”	21
said	21
Teresa;	21
“you	21
don’t	21
know	21
what	21
you’re	21
talking	21
about;	21
the	21
gentleman	21
is	21
quite	21
right,	21
for	21
‘as	21
the	21
time	21
so	21
the	21
behaviour;’	21
when	21
it	21
was	21
Sancho	21
it	21
was	21
‘Sancha;’	21
when	21
it	21
is	21
governor	21
it’s	21
‘señora;’	21
I	21
don’t	21
know	21
if	21
I’m	21
right.”	21
“Señora	21
Teresa	21
says	21
more	21
than	21
she	21
is	21
aware	21
of,”	21
said	21
the	21
page;	21
“and	21
now	21
give	21
me	21
something	21
to	21
eat	21
and	21
let	21
me	21
go	21
at	21
once,	21
for	21
I	21
mean	21
to	21
return	21
this	21
evening.”	21
“Come	21
and	21
do	21
penance	21
with	21
me,”	21
said	21
the	21
curate	21
at	21
this;	21
“for	21
Señora	21
Teresa	21
has	21
more	21
will	21
than	21
means	21
to	21
serve	21
so	21
worthy	21
a	21
guest.”	21
The	21
page	21
refused,	21
but	21
had	21
to	21
consent	21
at	21
last	21
for	21
his	21
own	21
sake;	21
and	21
the	21
curate	21
took	21
him	21
home	21
with	21
him	21
very	21
gladly,	21
in	21
order	21
to	21
have	21
an	21
opportunity	21
of	21
questioning	21
him	21
at	21
leisure	21
about	21
Don	21
Quixote	21
and	21
his	21
doings.	21
The	21
bachelor	21
offered	21
to	21
write	21
the	21
letters	21
in	21
reply	21
for	21
Teresa;	21
but	21
she	21
did	21
not	21
care	21
to	21
let	21
him	21
mix	21
himself	21
up	21
in	21
her	21
affairs,	21
for	21
she	21
thought	21
him	21
somewhat	21
given	21
to	21
joking;	21
and	21
so	21
she	21
gave	21
a	21
cake	21
and	21
a	21
couple	21
of	21
eggs	21
to	21
a	21
young	21
acolyte	21
who	21
was	21
a	21
penman,	21
and	21
he	21
wrote	21
for	21
her	21
two	21
letters,	21
one	21
for	21
her	21
husband	21
and	21
the	21
other	21
for	21
the	21
duchess,	21
dictated	21
out	21
of	21
her	21
own	21
head,	21
which	21
are	21
not	21
the	21
worst	21
inserted	21
in	21
this	21
great	21
history,	21
as	21
will	21
be	21
seen	21
farther	21
on.	21

Day	21
came	21
after	21
the	21
night	21
of	21
the	21
governor’s	21
round;	21
a	21
night	21
which	21
the	21
head-carver	21
passed	21
without	21
sleeping,	21
so	21
were	21
his	21
thoughts	21
of	21
the	21
face	21
and	21
air	21
and	21
beauty	21
of	21
the	21
disguised	21
damsel,	21
while	21
the	21
majordomo	21
spent	21
what	21
was	21
left	21
of	21
it	21
in	21
writing	21
an	21
account	21
to	21
his	21
lord	21
and	21
lady	21
of	21
all	21
Sancho	21
said	21
and	21
did,	21
being	21
as	21
much	21
amazed	21
at	21
his	21
sayings	21
as	21
at	21
his	21
doings,	21
for	21
there	21
was	21
a	21
mixture	21
of	21
shrewdness	21
and	21
simplicity	21
in	21
all	21
his	21
words	21
and	21
deeds.	21
The	21
señor	21
governor	21
got	21
up,	21
and	21
by	21
Doctor	21
Pedro	21
Recio’s	21
directions	21
they	21
made	21
him	21
break	21
his	21
fast	21
on	21
a	21
little	21
conserve	21
and	21
four	21
sups	21
of	21
cold	21
water,	21
which	21
Sancho	21
would	21
have	21
readily	21
exchanged	21
for	21
a	21
piece	21
of	21
bread	21
and	21
a	21
bunch	21
of	21
grapes;	21
but	21
seeing	21
there	21
was	21
no	21
help	21
for	21
it,	21
he	21
submitted	21
with	21
no	21
little	21
sorrow	21
of	21
heart	21
and	21
discomfort	21
of	21
stomach;	21
Pedro	21
Recio	21
having	21
persuaded	21
him	21
that	21
light	21
and	21
delicate	21
diet	21
enlivened	21
the	21
wits,	21
and	21
that	21
was	21
what	21
was	21
most	21
essential	21
for	21
persons	21
placed	21
in	21
command	21
and	21
in	21
responsible	21
situations,	21
where	21
they	21
have	21
to	21
employ	21
not	21
only	21
the	21
bodily	21
powers	21
but	21
those	21
of	21
the	21
mind	21
also.	21
By	21
means	21
of	21
this	21
sophistry	21
Sancho	21
was	21
made	21
to	21
endure	21
hunger,	21
and	21
hunger	21
so	21
keen	21
that	21
in	21
his	21
heart	21
he	21
cursed	21
the	21
government,	21
and	21
even	21
him	21
who	21
had	21
given	21
it	21
to	21
him;	21
however,	21
with	21
his	21
hunger	21
and	21
his	21
conserve	21
he	21
undertook	21
to	21
deliver	21
judgments	21
that	21
day,	21
and	21
the	21
first	21
thing	21
that	21
came	21
before	21
him	21
was	21
a	21
question	21
that	21
was	21
submitted	21
to	21
him	21
by	21
a	21
stranger,	21
in	21
the	21
presence	21
of	21
the	21
majordomo	21
and	21
the	21
other	21
attendants,	21
and	21
it	21
was	21
in	21
these	21
words:	21
“Señor,	21
a	21
large	21
river	21
separated	21
two	21
districts	21
of	21
one	21
and	21
the	21
same	21
lordship—will	21
your	21
worship	21
please	21
to	21
pay	21
attention,	21
for	21
the	21
case	21
is	21
an	21
important	21
and	21
a	21
rather	21
knotty	21
one?	21
Well	21
then,	21
on	21
this	21
river	21
there	21
was	21
a	21
bridge,	21
and	21
at	21
one	21
end	21
of	21
it	21
a	21
gallows,	21
and	21
a	21
sort	21
of	21
tribunal,	21
where	21
four	21
judges	21
commonly	21
sat	21
to	21
administer	21
the	21
law	21
which	21
the	21
lord	21
of	21
river,	21
bridge	21
and	21
the	21
lordship	21
had	21
enacted,	21
and	21
which	21
was	21
to	21
this	21
effect,	21
‘If	21
anyone	21
crosses	21
by	21
this	21
bridge	21
from	21
one	21
side	21
to	21
the	21
other	21
he	21
shall	21
declare	21
on	21
oath	21
where	21
he	21
is	21
going	21
to	21
and	21
with	21
what	21
object;	21
and	21
if	21
he	21
swears	21
truly,	21
he	21
shall	21
be	21
allowed	21
to	21
pass,	21
but	21
if	21
falsely,	21
he	21
shall	21
be	21
put	21
to	21
death	21
for	21
it	21
by	21
hanging	21
on	21
the	21
gallows	21
erected	21
there,	21
without	21
any	21
remission.’	21
Though	21
the	21
law	21
and	21
its	21
severe	21
penalty	21
were	21
known,	21
many	21
persons	21
crossed,	21
but	21
in	21
their	21
declarations	21
it	21
was	21
easy	21
to	21
see	21
at	21
once	21
they	21
were	21
telling	21
the	21
truth,	21
and	21
the	21
judges	21
let	21
them	21
pass	21
free.	21
It	21
happened,	21
however,	21
that	21
one	21
man,	21
when	21
they	21
came	21
to	21
take	21
his	21
declaration,	21
swore	21
and	21
said	21
that	21
by	21
the	21
oath	21
he	21
took	21
he	21
was	21
going	21
to	21
die	21
upon	21
that	21
gallows	21
that	21
stood	21
there,	21
and	21
nothing	21
else.	21
The	21
judges	21
held	21
a	21
consultation	21
over	21
the	21
oath,	21
and	21
they	21
said,	21
‘If	21
we	21
let	21
this	21
man	21
pass	21
free	21
he	21
has	21
sworn	21
falsely,	21
and	21
by	21
the	21
law	21
he	21
ought	21
to	21
die;	21
but	21
if	21
we	21
hang	21
him,	21
as	21
he	21
swore	21
he	21
was	21
going	21
to	21
die	21
on	21
that	21
gallows,	21
and	21
therefore	21
swore	21
the	21
truth,	21
by	21
the	21
same	21
law	21
he	21
ought	21
to	21
go	21
free.’	21
It	21
is	21
asked	21
of	21
your	21
worship,	21
señor	21
governor,	21
what	21
are	21
the	21
judges	21
to	21
do	21
with	21
this	21
man?	21
For	21
they	21
are	21
still	21
in	21
doubt	21
and	21
perplexity;	21
and	21
having	21
heard	21
of	21
your	21
worship’s	21
acute	21
and	21
exalted	21
intellect,	21
they	21
have	21
sent	21
me	21
to	21
entreat	21
your	21
worship	21
on	21
their	21
behalf	21
to	21
give	21
your	21
opinion	21
on	21
this	21
very	21
intricate	21
and	21
puzzling	21
case.”	21
To	21
this	21
Sancho	21
made	21
answer,	21
“Indeed	21
those	21
gentlemen	21
the	21
judges	21
that	21
send	21
you	21
to	21
me	21
might	21
have	21
spared	21
themselves	21
the	21
trouble,	21
for	21
I	21
have	21
more	21
of	21
the	21
obtuse	21
than	21
the	21
acute	21
in	21
me;	21
but	21
repeat	21
the	21
case	21
over	21
again,	21
so	21
that	21
I	21
may	21
understand	21
it,	21
and	21
then	21
perhaps	21
I	21
may	21
be	21
able	21
to	21
hit	21
the	21
point.”	21
The	21
querist	21
repeated	21
again	21
and	21
again	21
what	21
he	21
had	21
said	21
before,	21
and	21
then	21
Sancho	21
said,	21
“It	21
seems	21
to	21
me	21
I	21
can	21
set	21
the	21
matter	21
right	21
in	21
a	21
moment,	21
and	21
in	21
this	21
way;	21
the	21
man	21
swears	21
that	21
he	21
is	21
going	21
to	21
die	21
upon	21
the	21
gallows;	21
but	21
if	21
he	21
dies	21
upon	21
it,	21
he	21
has	21
sworn	21
the	21
truth,	21
and	21
by	21
the	21
law	21
enacted	21
deserves	21
to	21
go	21
free	21
and	21
pass	21
over	21
the	21
bridge;	21
but	21
if	21
they	21
don’t	21
hang	21
him,	21
then	21
he	21
has	21
sworn	21
falsely,	21
and	21
by	21
the	21
same	21
law	21
deserves	21
to	21
be	21
hanged.”	21
“It	21
is	21
as	21
the	21
señor	21
governor	21
says,”	21
said	21
the	21
messenger;	21
“and	21
as	21
regards	21
a	21
complete	21
comprehension	21
of	21
the	21
case,	21
there	21
is	21
nothing	21
left	21
to	21
desire	21
or	21
hesitate	21
about.”	21
“Well	21
then	21
I	21
say,”	21
said	21
Sancho,	21
“that	21
of	21
this	21
man	21
they	21
should	21
let	21
pass	21
the	21
part	21
that	21
has	21
sworn	21
truly,	21
and	21
hang	21
the	21
part	21
that	21
has	21
lied;	21
and	21
in	21
this	21
way	21
the	21
conditions	21
of	21
the	21
passage	21
will	21
be	21
fully	21
complied	21
with.”	21
“But	21
then,	21
señor	21
governor,”	21
replied	21
the	21
querist,	21
“the	21
man	21
will	21
have	21
to	21
be	21
divided	21
into	21
two	21
parts;	21
and	21
if	21
he	21
is	21
divided	21
of	21
course	21
he	21
will	21
die;	21
and	21
so	21
none	21
of	21
the	21
requirements	21
of	21
the	21
law	21
will	21
be	21
carried	21
out,	21
and	21
it	21
is	21
absolutely	21
necessary	21
to	21
comply	21
with	21
it.”	21
“Look	21
here,	21
my	21
good	21
sir,”	21
said	21
Sancho;	21
“either	21
I’m	21
a	21
numskull	21
or	21
else	21
there	21
is	21
the	21
same	21
reason	21
for	21
this	21
passenger	21
dying	21
as	21
for	21
his	21
living	21
and	21
passing	21
over	21
the	21
bridge;	21
for	21
if	21
the	21
truth	21
saves	21
him	21
the	21
falsehood	21
equally	21
condemns	21
him;	21
and	21
that	21
being	21
the	21
case	21
it	21
is	21
my	21
opinion	21
you	21
should	21
say	21
to	21
the	21
gentlemen	21
who	21
sent	21
you	21
to	21
me	21
that	21
as	21
the	21
arguments	21
for	21
condemning	21
him	21
and	21
for	21
absolving	21
him	21
are	21
exactly	21
balanced,	21
they	21
should	21
let	21
him	21
pass	21
freely,	21
as	21
it	21
is	21
always	21
more	21
praiseworthy	21
to	21
do	21
good	21
than	21
to	21
do	21
evil;	21
this	21
I	21
would	21
give	21
signed	21
with	21
my	21
name	21
if	21
I	21
knew	21
how	21
to	21
sign;	21
and	21
what	21
I	21
have	21
said	21
in	21
this	21
case	21
is	21
not	21
out	21
of	21
my	21
own	21
head,	21
but	21
one	21
of	21
the	21
many	21
precepts	21
my	21
master	21
Don	21
Quixote	21
gave	21
me	21
the	21
night	21
before	21
I	21
left	21
to	21
become	21
governor	21
of	21
this	21
island,	21
that	21
came	21
into	21
my	21
mind,	21
and	21
it	21
was	21
this,	21
that	21
when	21
there	21
was	21
any	21
doubt	21
about	21
the	21
justice	21
of	21
a	21
case	21
I	21
should	21
lean	21
to	21
mercy;	21
and	21
it	21
is	21
God’s	21
will	21
that	21
I	21
should	21
recollect	21
it	21
now,	21
for	21
it	21
fits	21
this	21
case	21
as	21
if	21
it	21
was	21
made	21
for	21
it.”	21
“That	21
is	21
true,”	21
said	21
the	21
majordomo;	21
“and	21
I	21
maintain	21
that	21
Lycurgus	21
himself,	21
who	21
gave	21
laws	21
to	21
the	21
Lacedemonians,	21
could	21
not	21
have	21
pronounced	21
a	21
better	21
decision	21
than	21
the	21
great	21
Panza	21
has	21
given;	21
let	21
the	21
morning’s	21
audience	21
close	21
with	21
this,	21
and	21
I	21
will	21
see	21
that	21
the	21
señor	21
governor	21
has	21
dinner	21
entirely	21
to	21
his	21
liking.”	21
“That’s	21
all	21
I	21
ask	21
for—fair	21
play,”	21
said	21
Sancho;	21
“give	21
me	21
my	21
dinner,	21
and	21
then	21
let	21
it	21
rain	21
cases	21
and	21
questions	21
on	21
me,	21
and	21
I’ll	21
despatch	21
them	21
in	21
a	21
twinkling.”	21
The	21
majordomo	21
kept	21
his	21
word,	21
for	21
he	21
felt	21
it	21
against	21
his	21
conscience	21
to	21
kill	21
so	21
wise	21
a	21
governor	21
by	21
hunger;	21
particularly	21
as	21
he	21
intended	21
to	21
have	21
done	21
with	21
him	21
that	21
same	21
night,	21
playing	21
off	21
the	21
last	21
joke	21
he	21
was	21
commissioned	21
to	21
practise	21
upon	21
him.	21
It	21
came	21
to	21
pass,	21
then,	21
that	21
after	21
he	21
had	21
dined	21
that	21
day,	21
in	21
opposition	21
to	21
the	21
rules	21
and	21
aphorisms	21
of	21
Doctor	21
Tirteafuera,	21
as	21
they	21
were	21
taking	21
away	21
the	21
cloth	21
there	21
came	21
a	21
courier	21
with	21
a	21
letter	21
from	21
Don	21
Quixote	21
for	21
the	21
governor.	21
Sancho	21
ordered	21
the	21
secretary	21
to	21
read	21
it	21
to	21
himself,	21
and	21
if	21
there	21
was	21
nothing	21
in	21
it	21
that	21
demanded	21
secrecy	21
to	21
read	21
it	21
aloud.	21
The	21
secretary	21
did	21
so,	21
and	21
after	21
he	21
had	21
skimmed	21
the	21
contents	21
he	21
said,	21
“It	21
may	21
well	21
be	21
read	21
aloud,	21
for	21
what	21
Señor	21
Don	21
Quixote	21
writes	21
to	21
your	21
worship	21
deserves	21
to	21
be	21
printed	21
or	21
written	21
in	21
letters	21
of	21
gold,	21
and	21
it	21
is	21
as	21
follows.”	21
DON	21
QUIXOTE	21
OF	21
LA	21
MANCHA’S	21
LETTER	21
TO	21
SANCHO	21
PANZA,	21
GOVERNOR	21
OF	21
THE	21
ISLAND	21
OF	21
BARATARIA.	21
When	21
I	21
was	21
expecting	21
to	21
hear	21
of	21
thy	21
stupidities	21
and	21
blunders,	21
friend	21
Sancho,	21
I	21
have	21
received	21
intelligence	21
of	21
thy	21
displays	21
of	21
good	21
sense,	21
for	21
which	21
I	21
give	21
special	21
thanks	21
to	21
heaven	21
that	21
can	21
raise	21
the	21
poor	21
from	21
the	21
dunghill	21
and	21
of	21
fools	21
to	21
make	21
wise	21
men.	21
They	21
tell	21
me	21
thou	21
dost	21
govern	21
as	21
if	21
thou	21
wert	21
a	21
man,	21
and	21
art	21
a	21
man	21
as	21
if	21
thou	21
wert	21
a	21
beast,	21
so	21
great	21
is	21
the	21
humility	21
wherewith	21
thou	21
dost	21
comport	21
thyself.	21
But	21
I	21
would	21
have	21
thee	21
bear	21
in	21
mind,	21
Sancho,	21
that	21
very	21
often	21
it	21
is	21
fitting	21
and	21
necessary	21
for	21
the	21
authority	21
of	21
office	21
to	21
resist	21
the	21
humility	21
of	21
the	21
heart;	21
for	21
the	21
seemly	21
array	21
of	21
one	21
who	21
is	21
invested	21
with	21
grave	21
duties	21
should	21
be	21
such	21
as	21
they	21
require	21
and	21
not	21
measured	21
by	21
what	21
his	21
own	21
humble	21
tastes	21
may	21
lead	21
him	21
to	21
prefer.	21
Dress	21
well;	21
a	21
stick	21
dressed	21
up	21
does	21
not	21
look	21
like	21
a	21
stick;	21
I	21
do	21
not	21
say	21
thou	21
shouldst	21
wear	21
trinkets	21
or	21
fine	21
raiment,	21
or	21
that	21
being	21
a	21
judge	21
thou	21
shouldst	21
dress	21
like	21
a	21
soldier,	21
but	21
that	21
thou	21
shouldst	21
array	21
thyself	21
in	21
the	21
apparel	21
thy	21
office	21
requires,	21
and	21
that	21
at	21
the	21
same	21
time	21
it	21
be	21
neat	21
and	21
handsome.	21
To	21
win	21
the	21
good-will	21
of	21
the	21
people	21
thou	21
governest	21
there	21
are	21
two	21
things,	21
among	21
others,	21
that	21
thou	21
must	21
do;	21
one	21
is	21
to	21
be	21
civil	21
to	21
all	21
(this,	21
however,	21
I	21
told	21
thee	21
before),	21
and	21
the	21
other	21
to	21
take	21
care	21
that	21
food	21
be	21
abundant,	21
for	21
there	21
is	21
nothing	21
that	21
vexes	21
the	21
heart	21
of	21
the	21
poor	21
more	21
than	21
hunger	21
and	21
high	21
prices.	21
Make	21
not	21
many	21
proclamations;	21
but	21
those	21
thou	21
makest	21
take	21
care	21
that	21
they	21
be	21
good	21
ones,	21
and	21
above	21
all	21
that	21
they	21
be	21
observed	21
and	21
carried	21
out;	21
for	21
proclamations	21
that	21
are	21
not	21
observed	21
are	21
the	21
same	21
as	21
if	21
they	21
did	21
not	21
exist;	21
nay,	21
they	21
encourage	21
the	21
idea	21
that	21
the	21
prince	21
who	21
had	21
the	21
wisdom	21
and	21
authority	21
to	21
make	21
them	21
had	21
not	21
the	21
power	21
to	21
enforce	21
them;	21
and	21
laws	21
that	21
threaten	21
and	21
are	21
not	21
enforced	21
come	21
to	21
be	21
like	21
the	21
log,	21
the	21
king	21
of	21
the	21
frogs,	21
that	21
frightened	21
them	21
at	21
first,	21
but	21
that	21
in	21
time	21
they	21
despised	21
and	21
mounted	21
upon.	21
Be	21
a	21
father	21
to	21
virtue	21
and	21
a	21
stepfather	21
to	21
vice.	21
Be	21
not	21
always	21
strict,	21
nor	21
yet	21
always	21
lenient,	21
but	21
observe	21
a	21
mean	21
between	21
these	21
two	21
extremes,	21
for	21
in	21
that	21
is	21
the	21
aim	21
of	21
wisdom.	21
Visit	21
the	21
gaols,	21
the	21
slaughter-houses,	21
and	21
the	21
market-places;	21
for	21
the	21
presence	21
of	21
the	21
governor	21
is	21
of	21
great	21
importance	21
in	21
such	21
places;	21
it	21
comforts	21
the	21
prisoners	21
who	21
are	21
in	21
hopes	21
of	21
a	21
speedy	21
release,	21
it	21
is	21
the	21
bugbear	21
of	21
the	21
butchers	21
who	21
have	21
then	21
to	21
give	21
just	21
weight,	21
and	21
it	21
is	21
the	21
terror	21
of	21
the	21
market-women	21
for	21
the	21
same	21
reason.	21
Let	21
it	21
not	21
be	21
seen	21
that	21
thou	21
art	21
(even	21
if	21
perchance	21
thou	21
art,	21
which	21
I	21
do	21
not	21
believe)	21
covetous,	21
a	21
follower	21
of	21
women,	21
or	21
a	21
glutton;	21
for	21
when	21
the	21
people	21
and	21
those	21
that	21
have	21
dealings	21
with	21
thee	21
become	21
aware	21
of	21
thy	21
special	21
weakness	21
they	21
will	21
bring	21
their	21
batteries	21
to	21
bear	21
upon	21
thee	21
in	21
that	21
quarter,	21
till	21
they	21
have	21
brought	21
thee	21
down	21
to	21
the	21
depths	21
of	21
perdition.	21
Consider	21
and	21
reconsider,	21
con	21
and	21
con	21
over	21
again	21
the	21
advices	21
and	21
the	21
instructions	21
I	21
gave	21
thee	21
before	21
thy	21
departure	21
hence	21
to	21
thy	21
government,	21
and	21
thou	21
wilt	21
see	21
that	21
in	21
them,	21
if	21
thou	21
dost	21
follow	21
them,	21
thou	21
hast	21
a	21
help	21
at	21
hand	21
that	21
will	21
lighten	21
for	21
thee	21
the	21
troubles	21
and	21
difficulties	21
that	21
beset	21
governors	21
at	21
every	21
step.	21
Write	21
to	21
thy	21
lord	21
and	21
lady	21
and	21
show	21
thyself	21
grateful	21
to	21
them,	21
for	21
ingratitude	21
is	21
the	21
daughter	21
of	21
pride,	21
and	21
one	21
of	21
the	21
greatest	21
sins	21
we	21
know	21
of;	21
and	21
he	21
who	21
is	21
grateful	21
to	21
those	21
who	21
have	21
been	21
good	21
to	21
him	21
shows	21
that	21
he	21
will	21
be	21
so	21
to	21
God	21
also	21
who	21
has	21
bestowed	21
and	21
still	21
bestows	21
so	21
many	21
blessings	21
upon	21
him.	21
My	21
lady	21
the	21
duchess	21
sent	21
off	21
a	21
messenger	21
with	21
thy	21
suit	21
and	21
another	21
present	21
to	21
thy	21
wife	21
Teresa	21
Panza;	21
we	21
expect	21
the	21
answer	21
every	21
moment.	21
I	21
have	21
been	21
a	21
little	21
indisposed	21
through	21
a	21
certain	21
scratching	21
I	21
came	21
in	21
for,	21
not	21
very	21
much	21
to	21
the	21
benefit	21
of	21
my	21
nose;	21
but	21
it	21
was	21
nothing;	21
for	21
if	21
there	21
are	21
enchanters	21
who	21
maltreat	21
me,	21
there	21
are	21
also	21
some	21
who	21
defend	21
me.	21
Let	21
me	21
know	21
if	21
the	21
majordomo	21
who	21
is	21
with	21
thee	21
had	21
any	21
share	21
in	21
the	21
Trifaldi	21
performance,	21
as	21
thou	21
didst	21
suspect;	21
and	21
keep	21
me	21
informed	21
of	21
everything	21
that	21
happens	21
thee,	21
as	21
the	21
distance	21
is	21
so	21
short;	21
all	21
the	21
more	21
as	21
I	21
am	21
thinking	21
of	21
giving	21
over	21
very	21
shortly	21
this	21
idle	21
life	21
I	21
am	21
now	21
leading,	21
for	21
I	21
was	21
not	21
born	21
for	21
it.	21
A	21
thing	21
has	21
occurred	21
to	21
me	21
which	21
I	21
am	21
inclined	21
to	21
think	21
will	21
put	21
me	21
out	21
of	21
favour	21
with	21
the	21
duke	21
and	21
duchess;	21
but	21
though	21
I	21
am	21
sorry	21
for	21
it	21
I	21
do	21
not	21
care,	21
for	21
after	21
all	21
I	21
must	21
obey	21
my	21
calling	21
rather	21
than	21
their	21
pleasure,	21
in	21
accordance	21
with	21
the	21
common	21
saying,	21
_amicus	21
Plato,	21
sed	21
magis	21
amica	21
veritas_.	21
I	21
quote	21
this	21
Latin	21
to	21
thee	21
because	21
I	21
conclude	21
that	21
since	21
thou	21
hast	21
been	21
a	21
governor	21
thou	21
wilt	21
have	21
learned	21
it.	21
Adieu;	21
God	21
keep	21
thee	21
from	21
being	21
an	21
object	21
of	21
pity	21
to	21
anyone.	21
Thy	21
friend,	21
DON	21
QUIXOTE	21
OF	21
LA	21
MANCHA.	21
Sancho	21
listened	21
to	21
the	21
letter	21
with	21
great	21
attention,	21
and	21
it	21
was	21
praised	21
and	21
considered	21
wise	21
by	21
all	21
who	21
heard	21
it;	21
he	21
then	21
rose	21
up	21
from	21
table,	21
and	21
calling	21
his	21
secretary	21
shut	21
himself	21
in	21
with	21
him	21
in	21
his	21
own	21
room,	21
and	21
without	21
putting	21
it	21
off	21
any	21
longer	21
set	21
about	21
answering	21
his	21
master	21
Don	21
Quixote	21
at	21
once;	21
and	21
he	21
bade	21
the	21
secretary	21
write	21
down	21
what	21
he	21
told	21
him	21
without	21
adding	21
or	21
suppressing	21
anything,	21
which	21
he	21
did,	21
and	21
the	21
answer	21
was	21
to	21
the	21
following	21
effect.	21
SANCHO	21
PANZA’S	21
LETTER	21
TO	21
DON	21
QUIXOTE	21
OF	21
LA	21
MANCHA.	21
The	21
pressure	21
of	21
business	21
is	21
so	21
great	21
upon	21
me	21
that	21
I	21
have	21
no	21
time	21
to	21
scratch	21
my	21
head	21
or	21
even	21
to	21
cut	21
my	21
nails;	21
and	21
I	21
have	21
them	21
so	21
long—God	21
send	21
a	21
remedy	21
for	21
it.	21
I	21
say	21
this,	21
master	21
of	21
my	21
soul,	21
that	21
you	21
may	21
not	21
be	21
surprised	21
if	21
I	21
have	21
not	21
until	21
now	21
sent	21
you	21
word	21
of	21
how	21
I	21
fare,	21
well	21
or	21
ill,	21
in	21
this	21
government,	21
in	21
which	21
I	21
am	21
suffering	21
more	21
hunger	21
than	21
when	21
we	21
two	21
were	21
wandering	21
through	21
the	21
woods	21
and	21
wastes.	21
My	21
lord	21
the	21
duke	21
wrote	21
to	21
me	21
the	21
other	21
day	21
to	21
warn	21
me	21
that	21
certain	21
spies	21
had	21
got	21
into	21
this	21
island	21
to	21
kill	21
me;	21
but	21
up	21
to	21
the	21
present	21
I	21
have	21
not	21
found	21
out	21
any	21
except	21
a	21
certain	21
doctor	21
who	21
receives	21
a	21
salary	21
in	21
this	21
town	21
for	21
killing	21
all	21
the	21
governors	21
that	21
come	21
here;	21
he	21
is	21
called	21
Doctor	21
Pedro	21
Recio,	21
and	21
is	21
from	21
Tirteafuera;	21
so	21
you	21
see	21
what	21
a	21
name	21
he	21
has	21
to	21
make	21
me	21
dread	21
dying	21
under	21
his	21
hands.	21
This	21
doctor	21
says	21
of	21
himself	21
that	21
he	21
does	21
not	21
cure	21
diseases	21
when	21
there	21
are	21
any,	21
but	21
prevents	21
them	21
coming,	21
and	21
the	21
medicines	21
he	21
uses	21
are	21
diet	21
and	21
more	21
diet	21
until	21
he	21
brings	21
one	21
down	21
to	21
bare	21
bones;	21
as	21
if	21
leanness	21
was	21
not	21
worse	21
than	21
fever.	21
In	21
short	21
he	21
is	21
killing	21
me	21
with	21
hunger,	21
and	21
I	21
am	21
dying	21
myself	21
of	21
vexation;	21
for	21
when	21
I	21
thought	21
I	21
was	21
coming	21
to	21
this	21
government	21
to	21
get	21
my	21
meat	21
hot	21
and	21
my	21
drink	21
cool,	21
and	21
take	21
my	21
ease	21
between	21
holland	21
sheets	21
on	21
feather	21
beds,	21
I	21
find	21
I	21
have	21
come	21
to	21
do	21
penance	21
as	21
if	21
I	21
was	21
a	21
hermit;	21
and	21
as	21
I	21
don’t	21
do	21
it	21
willingly	21
I	21
suspect	21
that	21
in	21
the	21
end	21
the	21
devil	21
will	21
carry	21
me	21
off.	21
So	21
far	21
I	21
have	21
not	21
handled	21
any	21
dues	21
or	21
taken	21
any	21
bribes,	21
and	21
I	21
don’t	21
know	21
what	21
to	21
think	21
of	21
it;	21
for	21
here	21
they	21
tell	21
me	21
that	21
the	21
governors	21
that	21
come	21
to	21
this	21
island,	21
before	21
entering	21
it	21
have	21
plenty	21
of	21
money	21
either	21
given	21
to	21
them	21
or	21
lent	21
to	21
them	21
by	21
the	21
people	21
of	21
the	21
town,	21
and	21
that	21
this	21
is	21
the	21
usual	21
custom	21
not	21
only	21
here	21
but	21
with	21
all	21
who	21
enter	21
upon	21
governments.	21
Last	21
night	21
going	21
the	21
rounds	21
I	21
came	21
upon	21
a	21
fair	21
damsel	21
in	21
man’s	21
clothes,	21
and	21
a	21
brother	21
of	21
hers	21
dressed	21
as	21
a	21
woman;	21
my	21
head-carver	21
has	21
fallen	21
in	21
love	21
with	21
the	21
girl,	21
and	21
has	21
in	21
his	21
own	21
mind	21
chosen	21
her	21
for	21
a	21
wife,	21
so	21
he	21
says,	21
and	21
I	21
have	21
chosen	21
the	21
youth	21
for	21
a	21
son-in-law;	21
to-day	21
we	21
are	21
going	21
to	21
explain	21
our	21
intentions	21
to	21
the	21
father	21
of	21
the	21
pair,	21
who	21
is	21
one	21
Diego	21
de	21
la	21
Llana,	21
a	21
gentleman	21
and	21
an	21
old	21
Christian	21
as	21
much	21
as	21
you	21
please.	21
I	21
have	21
visited	21
the	21
market-places,	21
as	21
your	21
worship	21
advises	21
me,	21
and	21
yesterday	21
I	21
found	21
a	21
stall-keeper	21
selling	21
new	21
hazel	21
nuts	21
and	21
proved	21
her	21
to	21
have	21
mixed	21
a	21
bushel	21
of	21
old	21
empty	21
rotten	21
nuts	21
with	21
a	21
bushel	21
of	21
new;	21
I	21
confiscated	21
the	21
whole	21
for	21
the	21
children	21
of	21
the	21
charity-school,	21
who	21
will	21
know	21
how	21
to	21
distinguish	21
them	21
well	21
enough,	21
and	21
I	21
sentenced	21
her	21
not	21
to	21
come	21
into	21
the	21
market-place	21
for	21
a	21
fortnight;	21
they	21
told	21
me	21
I	21
did	21
bravely.	21
I	21
can	21
tell	21
your	21
worship	21
it	21
is	21
commonly	21
said	21
in	21
this	21
town	21
that	21
there	21
are	21
no	21
people	21
worse	21
than	21
the	21
market-women,	21
for	21
they	21
are	21
all	21
barefaced,	21
unconscionable,	21
and	21
impudent,	21
and	21
I	21
can	21
well	21
believe	21
it	21
from	21
what	21
I	21
have	21
seen	21
of	21
them	21
in	21
other	21
towns.	21
I	21
am	21
very	21
glad	21
my	21
lady	21
the	21
duchess	21
has	21
written	21
to	21
my	21
wife	21
Teresa	21
Panza	21
and	21
sent	21
her	21
the	21
present	21
your	21
worship	21
speaks	21
of;	21
and	21
I	21
will	21
strive	21
to	21
show	21
myself	21
grateful	21
when	21
the	21
time	21
comes;	21
kiss	21
her	21
hands	21
for	21
me,	21
and	21
tell	21
her	21
I	21
say	21
she	21
has	21
not	21
thrown	21
it	21
into	21
a	21
sack	21
with	21
a	21
hole	21
in	21
it,	21
as	21
she	21
will	21
see	21
in	21
the	21
end.	21
I	21
should	21
not	21
like	21
your	21
worship	21
to	21
have	21
any	21
difference	21
with	21
my	21
lord	21
and	21
lady;	21
for	21
if	21
you	21
fall	21
out	21
with	21
them	21
it	21
is	21
plain	21
it	21
must	21
do	21
me	21
harm;	21
and	21
as	21
you	21
give	21
me	21
advice	21
to	21
be	21
grateful	21
it	21
will	21
not	21
do	21
for	21
your	21
worship	21
not	21
to	21
be	21
so	21
yourself	21
to	21
those	21
who	21
have	21
shown	21
you	21
such	21
kindness,	21
and	21
by	21
whom	21
you	21
have	21
been	21
treated	21
so	21
hospitably	21
in	21
their	21
castle.	21
That	21
about	21
the	21
scratching	21
I	21
don’t	21
understand;	21
but	21
I	21
suppose	21
it	21
must	21
be	21
one	21
of	21
the	21
ill-turns	21
the	21
wicked	21
enchanters	21
are	21
always	21
doing	21
your	21
worship;	21
when	21
we	21
meet	21
I	21
shall	21
know	21
all	21
about	21
it.	21
I	21
wish	21
I	21
could	21
send	21
your	21
worship	21
something;	21
but	21
I	21
don’t	21
know	21
what	21
to	21
send,	21
unless	21
it	21
be	21
some	21
very	21
curious	21
clyster	21
pipes,	21
to	21
work	21
with	21
bladders,	21
that	21
they	21
make	21
in	21
this	21
island;	21
but	21
if	21
the	21
office	21
remains	21
with	21
me	21
I’ll	21
find	21
out	21
something	21
to	21
send,	21
one	21
way	21
or	21
another.	21
If	21
my	21
wife	21
Teresa	21
Panza	21
writes	21
to	21
me,	21
pay	21
the	21
postage	21
and	21
send	21
me	21
the	21
letter,	21
for	21
I	21
have	21
a	21
very	21
great	21
desire	21
to	21
hear	21
how	21
my	21
house	21
and	21
wife	21
and	21
children	21
are	21
going	21
on.	21
And	21
so,	21
may	21
God	21
deliver	21
your	21
worship	21
from	21
evil-minded	21
enchanters,	21
and	21
bring	21
me	21
well	21
and	21
peacefully	21
out	21
of	21
this	21
government,	21
which	21
I	21
doubt,	21
for	21
I	21
expect	21
to	21
take	21
leave	21
of	21
it	21
and	21
my	21
life	21
together,	21
from	21
the	21
way	21
Doctor	21
Pedro	21
Recio	21
treats	21
me.	21
Your	21
worship’s	21
servant	21
SANCHO	21
PANZA	21
THE	21
GOVERNOR.	21
The	21
secretary	21
sealed	21
the	21
letter,	21
and	21
immediately	21
dismissed	21
the	21
courier;	21
and	21
those	21
who	21
were	21
carrying	21
on	21
the	21
joke	21
against	21
Sancho	21
putting	21
their	21
heads	21
together	21
arranged	21
how	21
he	21
was	21
to	21
be	21
dismissed	21
from	21
the	21
government.	21
Sancho	21
spent	21
the	21
afternoon	21
in	21
drawing	21
up	21
certain	21
ordinances	21
relating	21
to	21
the	21
good	21
government	21
of	21
what	21
he	21
fancied	21
the	21
island;	21
and	21
he	21
ordained	21
that	21
there	21
were	21
to	21
be	21
no	21
provision	21
hucksters	21
in	21
the	21
State,	21
and	21
that	21
men	21
might	21
import	21
wine	21
into	21
it	21
from	21
any	21
place	21
they	21
pleased,	21
provided	21
they	21
declared	21
the	21
quarter	21
it	21
came	21
from,	21
so	21
that	21
a	21
price	21
might	21
be	21
put	21
upon	21
it	21
according	21
to	21
its	21
quality,	21
reputation,	21
and	21
the	21
estimation	21
it	21
was	21
held	21
in;	21
and	21
he	21
that	21
watered	21
his	21
wine,	21
or	21
changed	21
the	21
name,	21
was	21
to	21
forfeit	21
his	21
life	21
for	21
it.	21
He	21
reduced	21
the	21
prices	21
of	21
all	21
manner	21
of	21
shoes,	21
boots,	21
and	21
stockings,	21
but	21
of	21
shoes	21
in	21
particular,	21
as	21
they	21
seemed	21
to	21
him	21
to	21
run	21
extravagantly	21
high.	21
He	21
established	21
a	21
fixed	21
rate	21
for	21
servants’	21
wages,	21
which	21
were	21
becoming	21
recklessly	21
exorbitant.	21
He	21
laid	21
extremely	21
heavy	21
penalties	21
upon	21
those	21
who	21
sang	21
lewd	21
or	21
loose	21
songs	21
either	21
by	21
day	21
or	21
night.	21
He	21
decreed	21
that	21
no	21
blind	21
man	21
should	21
sing	21
of	21
any	21
miracle	21
in	21
verse,	21
unless	21
he	21
could	21
produce	21
authentic	21
evidence	21
that	21
it	21
was	21
true,	21
for	21
it	21
was	21
his	21
opinion	21
that	21
most	21
of	21
those	21
the	21
blind	21
men	21
sing	21
are	21
trumped	21
up,	21
to	21
the	21
detriment	21
of	21
the	21
true	21
ones.	21
He	21
established	21
and	21
created	21
an	21
alguacil	21
of	21
the	21
poor,	21
not	21
to	21
harass	21
them,	21
but	21
to	21
examine	21
them	21
and	21
see	21
whether	21
they	21
really	21
were	21
so;	21
for	21
many	21
a	21
sturdy	21
thief	21
or	21
drunkard	21
goes	21
about	21
under	21
cover	21
of	21
a	21
make-believe	21
crippled	21
limb	21
or	21
a	21
sham	21
sore.	21
In	21
a	21
word,	21
he	21
made	21
so	21
many	21
good	21
rules	21
that	21
to	21
this	21
day	21
they	21
are	21
preserved	21
there,	21
and	21
are	21
called	21
_The	21
constitutions	21
of	21
the	21
great	21
governor	21
Sancho	21
Panza_.	21

relates	21
that	21
Don	21
Quixote	21
being	21
now	21
cured	21
of	21
his	21
scratches	21
felt	21
that	21
the	21
life	21
he	21
was	21
leading	21
in	21
the	21
castle	21
was	21
entirely	21
inconsistent	21
with	21
the	21
order	21
of	21
chivalry	21
he	21
professed,	21
so	21
he	21
determined	21
to	21
ask	21
the	21
duke	21
and	21
duchess	21
to	21
permit	21
him	21
to	21
take	21
his	21
departure	21
for	21
Saragossa,	21
as	21
the	21
time	21
of	21
the	21
festival	21
was	21
now	21
drawing	21
near,	21
and	21
he	21
hoped	21
to	21
win	21
there	21
the	21
suit	21
of	21
armour	21
which	21
is	21
the	21
prize	21
at	21
festivals	21
of	21
the	21
sort.	21
But	21
one	21
day	21
at	21
table	21
with	21
the	21
duke	21
and	21
duchess,	21
just	21
as	21
he	21
was	21
about	21
to	21
carry	21
his	21
resolution	21
into	21
effect	21
and	21
ask	21
for	21
their	21
permission,	21
lo	21
and	21
behold	21
suddenly	21
there	21
came	21
in	21
through	21
the	21
door	21
of	21
the	21
great	21
hall	21
two	21
women,	21
as	21
they	21
afterwards	21
proved	21
to	21
be,	21
draped	21
in	21
mourning	21
from	21
head	21
to	21
foot,	21
one	21
of	21
whom	21
approaching	21
Don	21
Quixote	21
flung	21
herself	21
at	21
full	21
length	21
at	21
his	21
feet,	21
pressing	21
her	21
lips	21
to	21
them,	21
and	21
uttering	21
moans	21
so	21
sad,	21
so	21
deep,	21
and	21
so	21
doleful	21
that	21
she	21
put	21
all	21
who	21
heard	21
and	21
saw	21
her	21
into	21
a	21
state	21
of	21
perplexity;	21
and	21
though	21
the	21
duke	21
and	21
duchess	21
supposed	21
it	21
must	21
be	21
some	21
joke	21
their	21
servants	21
were	21
playing	21
off	21
upon	21
Don	21
Quixote,	21
still	21
the	21
earnest	21
way	21
the	21
woman	21
sighed	21
and	21
moaned	21
and	21
wept	21
puzzled	21
them	21
and	21
made	21
them	21
feel	21
uncertain,	21
until	21
Don	21
Quixote,	21
touched	21
with	21
compassion,	21
raised	21
her	21
up	21
and	21
made	21
her	21
unveil	21
herself	21
and	21
remove	21
the	21
mantle	21
from	21
her	21
tearful	21
face.	21
She	21
complied	21
and	21
disclosed	21
what	21
no	21
one	21
could	21
have	21
ever	21
anticipated,	21
for	21
she	21
disclosed	21
the	21
countenance	21
of	21
Doña	21
Rodriguez,	21
the	21
duenna	21
of	21
the	21
house;	21
the	21
other	21
female	21
in	21
mourning	21
being	21
her	21
daughter,	21
who	21
had	21
been	21
made	21
a	21
fool	21
of	21
by	21
the	21
rich	21
farmer’s	21
son.	21
All	21
who	21
knew	21
her	21
were	21
filled	21
with	21
astonishment,	21
and	21
the	21
duke	21
and	21
duchess	21
more	21
than	21
any;	21
for	21
though	21
they	21
thought	21
her	21
a	21
simpleton	21
and	21
a	21
weak	21
creature,	21
they	21
did	21
not	21
think	21
her	21
capable	21
of	21
crazy	21
pranks.	21
Doña	21
Rodriguez,	21
at	21
length,	21
turning	21
to	21
her	21
master	21
and	21
mistress	21
said	21
to	21
them,	21
“Will	21
your	21
excellences	21
be	21
pleased	21
to	21
permit	21
me	21
to	21
speak	21
to	21
this	21
gentleman	21
for	21
a	21
moment,	21
for	21
it	21
is	21
requisite	21
I	21
should	21
do	21
so	21
in	21
order	21
to	21
get	21
successfully	21
out	21
of	21
the	21
business	21
in	21
which	21
the	21
boldness	21
of	21
an	21
evil-minded	21
clown	21
has	21
involved	21
me?”	21
The	21
duke	21
said	21
that	21
for	21
his	21
part	21
he	21
gave	21
her	21
leave,	21
and	21
that	21
she	21
might	21
speak	21
with	21
Señor	21
Don	21
Quixote	21
as	21
much	21
as	21
she	21
liked.	21
She	21
then,	21
turning	21
to	21
Don	21
Quixote	21
and	21
addressing	21
herself	21
to	21
him	21
said,	21
“Some	21
days	21
since,	21
valiant	21
knight,	21
I	21
gave	21
you	21
an	21
account	21
of	21
the	21
injustice	21
and	21
treachery	21
of	21
a	21
wicked	21
farmer	21
to	21
my	21
dearly	21
beloved	21
daughter,	21
the	21
unhappy	21
damsel	21
here	21
before	21
you,	21
and	21
you	21
promised	21
me	21
to	21
take	21
her	21
part	21
and	21
right	21
the	21
wrong	21
that	21
has	21
been	21
done	21
her;	21
but	21
now	21
it	21
has	21
come	21
to	21
my	21
hearing	21
that	21
you	21
are	21
about	21
to	21
depart	21
from	21
this	21
castle	21
in	21
quest	21
of	21
such	21
fair	21
adventures	21
as	21
God	21
may	21
vouchsafe	21
to	21
you;	21
therefore,	21
before	21
you	21
take	21
the	21
road,	21
I	21
would	21
that	21
you	21
challenge	21
this	21
froward	21
rustic,	21
and	21
compel	21
him	21
to	21
marry	21
my	21
daughter	21
in	21
fulfillment	21
of	21
the	21
promise	21
he	21
gave	21
her	21
to	21
become	21
her	21
husband	21
before	21
he	21
seduced	21
her;	21
for	21
to	21
expect	21
that	21
my	21
lord	21
the	21
duke	21
will	21
do	21
me	21
justice	21
is	21
to	21
ask	21
pears	21
from	21
the	21
elm	21
tree,	21
for	21
the	21
reason	21
I	21
stated	21
privately	21
to	21
your	21
worship;	21
and	21
so	21
may	21
our	21
Lord	21
grant	21
you	21
good	21
health	21
and	21
forsake	21
us	21
not.”	21
To	21
these	21
words	21
Don	21
Quixote	21
replied	21
very	21
gravely	21
and	21
solemnly,	21
“Worthy	21
duenna,	21
check	21
your	21
tears,	21
or	21
rather	21
dry	21
them,	21
and	21
spare	21
your	21
sighs,	21
for	21
I	21
take	21
it	21
upon	21
myself	21
to	21
obtain	21
redress	21
for	21
your	21
daughter,	21
for	21
whom	21
it	21
would	21
have	21
been	21
better	21
not	21
to	21
have	21
been	21
so	21
ready	21
to	21
believe	21
lovers’	21
promises,	21
which	21
are	21
for	21
the	21
most	21
part	21
quickly	21
made	21
and	21
very	21
slowly	21
performed;	21
and	21
so,	21
with	21
my	21
lord	21
the	21
duke’s	21
leave,	21
I	21
will	21
at	21
once	21
go	21
in	21
quest	21
of	21
this	21
inhuman	21
youth,	21
and	21
will	21
find	21
him	21
out	21
and	21
challenge	21
him	21
and	21
slay	21
him,	21
if	21
so	21
be	21
he	21
refuses	21
to	21
keep	21
his	21
promised	21
word;	21
for	21
the	21
chief	21
object	21
of	21
my	21
profession	21
is	21
to	21
spare	21
the	21
humble	21
and	21
chastise	21
the	21
proud;	21
I	21
mean,	21
to	21
help	21
the	21
distressed	21
and	21
destroy	21
the	21
oppressors.”	21
“There	21
is	21
no	21
necessity,”	21
said	21
the	21
duke,	21
“for	21
your	21
worship	21
to	21
take	21
the	21
trouble	21
of	21
seeking	21
out	21
the	21
rustic	21
of	21
whom	21
this	21
worthy	21
duenna	21
complains,	21
nor	21
is	21
there	21
any	21
necessity,	21
either,	21
for	21
asking	21
my	21
leave	21
to	21
challenge	21
him;	21
for	21
I	21
admit	21
him	21
duly	21
challenged,	21
and	21
will	21
take	21
care	21
that	21
he	21
is	21
informed	21
of	21
the	21
challenge,	21
and	21
accepts	21
it,	21
and	21
comes	21
to	21
answer	21
it	21
in	21
person	21
to	21
this	21
castle	21
of	21
mine,	21
where	21
I	21
shall	21
afford	21
to	21
both	21
a	21
fair	21
field,	21
observing	21
all	21
the	21
conditions	21
which	21
are	21
usually	21
and	21
properly	21
observed	21
in	21
such	21
trials,	21
and	21
observing	21
too	21
justice	21
to	21
both	21
sides,	21
as	21
all	21
princes	21
who	21
offer	21
a	21
free	21
field	21
to	21
combatants	21
within	21
the	21
limits	21
of	21
their	21
lordships	21
are	21
bound	21
to	21
do.”	21
“Then	21
with	21
that	21
assurance	21
and	21
your	21
highness’s	21
good	21
leave,”	21
said	21
Don	21
Quixote,	21
“I	21
hereby	21
for	21
this	21
once	21
waive	21
my	21
privilege	21
of	21
gentle	21
blood,	21
and	21
come	21
down	21
and	21
put	21
myself	21
on	21
a	21
level	21
with	21
the	21
lowly	21
birth	21
of	21
the	21
wrong-doer,	21
making	21
myself	21
equal	21
with	21
him	21
and	21
enabling	21
him	21
to	21
enter	21
into	21
combat	21
with	21
me;	21
and	21
so,	21
I	21
challenge	21
and	21
defy	21
him,	21
though	21
absent,	21
on	21
the	21
plea	21
of	21
his	21
malfeasance	21
in	21
breaking	21
faith	21
with	21
this	21
poor	21
damsel,	21
who	21
was	21
a	21
maiden	21
and	21
now	21
by	21
his	21
misdeed	21
is	21
none;	21
and	21
say	21
that	21
he	21
shall	21
fulfill	21
the	21
promise	21
he	21
gave	21
her	21
to	21
become	21
her	21
lawful	21
husband,	21
or	21
else	21
stake	21
his	21
life	21
upon	21
the	21
question.”	21
And	21
then	21
plucking	21
off	21
a	21
glove	21
he	21
threw	21
it	21
down	21
in	21
the	21
middle	21
of	21
the	21
hall,	21
and	21
the	21
duke	21
picked	21
it	21
up,	21
saying,	21
as	21
he	21
had	21
said	21
before,	21
that	21
he	21
accepted	21
the	21
challenge	21
in	21
the	21
name	21
of	21
his	21
vassal,	21
and	21
fixed	21
six	21
days	21
thence	21
as	21
the	21
time,	21
the	21
courtyard	21
of	21
the	21
castle	21
as	21
the	21
place,	21
and	21
for	21
arms	21
the	21
customary	21
ones	21
of	21
knights,	21
lance	21
and	21
shield	21
and	21
full	21
armour,	21
with	21
all	21
the	21
other	21
accessories,	21
without	21
trickery,	21
guile,	21
or	21
charms	21
of	21
any	21
sort,	21
and	21
examined	21
and	21
passed	21
by	21
the	21
judges	21
of	21
the	21
field.	21
“But	21
first	21
of	21
all,”	21
he	21
said,	21
“it	21
is	21
requisite	21
that	21
this	21
worthy	21
duenna	21
and	21
unworthy	21
damsel	21
should	21
place	21
their	21
claim	21
for	21
justice	21
in	21
the	21
hands	21
of	21
Don	21
Quixote;	21
for	21
otherwise	21
nothing	21
can	21
be	21
done,	21
nor	21
can	21
the	21
said	21
challenge	21
be	21
brought	21
to	21
a	21
lawful	21
issue.”	21
“I	21
do	21
so	21
place	21
it,”	21
replied	21
the	21
duenna.	21
“And	21
I	21
too,”	21
added	21
her	21
daughter,	21
all	21
in	21
tears	21
and	21
covered	21
with	21
shame	21
and	21
confusion.	21
This	21
declaration	21
having	21
been	21
made,	21
and	21
the	21
duke	21
having	21
settled	21
in	21
his	21
own	21
mind	21
what	21
he	21
would	21
do	21
in	21
the	21
matter,	21
the	21
ladies	21
in	21
black	21
withdrew,	21
and	21
the	21
duchess	21
gave	21
orders	21
that	21
for	21
the	21
future	21
they	21
were	21
not	21
to	21
be	21
treated	21
as	21
servants	21
of	21
hers,	21
but	21
as	21
lady	21
adventurers	21
who	21
came	21
to	21
her	21
house	21
to	21
demand	21
justice;	21
so	21
they	21
gave	21
them	21
a	21
room	21
to	21
themselves	21
and	21
waited	21
on	21
them	21
as	21
they	21
would	21
on	21
strangers,	21
to	21
the	21
consternation	21
of	21
the	21
other	21
women-servants,	21
who	21
did	21
not	21
know	21
where	21
the	21
folly	21
and	21
imprudence	21
of	21
Doña	21
Rodriguez	21
and	21
her	21
unlucky	21
daughter	21
would	21
stop.	21
And	21
now,	21
to	21
complete	21
the	21
enjoyment	21
of	21
the	21
feast	21
and	21
bring	21
the	21
dinner	21
to	21
a	21
satisfactory	21
end,	21
lo	21
and	21
behold	21
the	21
page	21
who	21
had	21
carried	21
the	21
letters	21
and	21
presents	21
to	21
Teresa	21
Panza,	21
the	21
wife	21
of	21
the	21
governor	21
Sancho,	21
entered	21
the	21
hall;	21
and	21
the	21
duke	21
and	21
duchess	21
were	21
very	21
well	21
pleased	21
to	21
see	21
him,	21
being	21
anxious	21
to	21
know	21
the	21
result	21
of	21
his	21
journey;	21
but	21
when	21
they	21
asked	21
him	21
the	21
page	21
said	21
in	21
reply	21
that	21
he	21
could	21
not	21
give	21
it	21
before	21
so	21
many	21
people	21
or	21
in	21
a	21
few	21
words,	21
and	21
begged	21
their	21
excellences	21
to	21
be	21
pleased	21
to	21
let	21
it	21
wait	21
for	21
a	21
private	21
opportunity,	21
and	21
in	21
the	21
meantime	21
amuse	21
themselves	21
with	21
these	21
letters;	21
and	21
taking	21
out	21
the	21
letters	21
he	21
placed	21
them	21
in	21
the	21
duchess’s	21
hand.	21
One	21
bore	21
by	21
way	21
of	21
address,	21
_Letter	21
for	21
my	21
lady	21
the	21
Duchess	21
So-and-so,	21
of	21
I	21
don’t	21
know	21
where;	21
and	21
the	21
other	21
To	21
my	21
husband	21
Sancho	21
Panza,	21
governor	21
of	21
the	21
island	21
of	21
Barataria,	21
whom	21
God	21
prosper	21
longer	21
than	21
me_.	21
The	21
duchess’s	21
bread	21
would	21
not	21
bake,	21
as	21
the	21
saying	21
is,	21
until	21
she	21
had	21
read	21
her	21
letter;	21
and	21
having	21
looked	21
over	21
it	21
herself	21
and	21
seen	21
that	21
it	21
might	21
be	21
read	21
aloud	21
for	21
the	21
duke	21
and	21
all	21
present	21
to	21
hear,	21
she	21
read	21
out	21
as	21
follows.	21
TERESA	21
PANZA’S	21
LETTER	21
TO	21
THE	21
DUCHESS.	21
The	21
letter	21
your	21
highness	21
wrote	21
me,	21
my	21
lady,	21
gave	21
me	21
great	21
pleasure,	21
for	21
indeed	21
I	21
found	21
it	21
very	21
welcome.	21
The	21
string	21
of	21
coral	21
beads	21
is	21
very	21
fine,	21
and	21
my	21
husband’s	21
hunting	21
suit	21
does	21
not	21
fall	21
short	21
of	21
it.	21
All	21
this	21
village	21
is	21
very	21
much	21
pleased	21
that	21
your	21
ladyship	21
has	21
made	21
a	21
governor	21
of	21
my	21
good	21
man	21
Sancho;	21
though	21
nobody	21
will	21
believe	21
it,	21
particularly	21
the	21
curate,	21
and	21
Master	21
Nicholas	21
the	21
barber,	21
and	21
the	21
bachelor	21
Samson	21
Carrasco;	21
but	21
I	21
don’t	21
care	21
for	21
that,	21
for	21
so	21
long	21
as	21
it	21
is	21
true,	21
as	21
it	21
is,	21
they	21
may	21
all	21
say	21
what	21
they	21
like;	21
though,	21
to	21
tell	21
the	21
truth,	21
if	21
the	21
coral	21
beads	21
and	21
the	21
suit	21
had	21
not	21
come	21
I	21
would	21
not	21
have	21
believed	21
it	21
either;	21
for	21
in	21
this	21
village	21
everybody	21
thinks	21
my	21
husband	21
a	21
numskull,	21
and	21
except	21
for	21
governing	21
a	21
flock	21
of	21
goats,	21
they	21
cannot	21
fancy	21
what	21
sort	21
of	21
government	21
he	21
can	21
be	21
fit	21
for.	21
God	21
grant	21
it,	21
and	21
direct	21
him	21
according	21
as	21
he	21
sees	21
his	21
children	21
stand	21
in	21
need	21
of	21
it.	21
I	21
am	21
resolved	21
with	21
your	21
worship’s	21
leave,	21
lady	21
of	21
my	21
soul,	21
to	21
make	21
the	21
most	21
of	21
this	21
fair	21
day,	21
and	21
go	21
to	21
Court	21
to	21
stretch	21
myself	21
at	21
ease	21
in	21
a	21
coach,	21
and	21
make	21
all	21
those	21
I	21
have	21
envying	21
me	21
already	21
burst	21
their	21
eyes	21
out;	21
so	21
I	21
beg	21
your	21
excellence	21
to	21
order	21
my	21
husband	21
to	21
send	21
me	21
a	21
small	21
trifle	21
of	21
money,	21
and	21
to	21
let	21
it	21
be	21
something	21
to	21
speak	21
of,	21
because	21
one’s	21
expenses	21
are	21
heavy	21
at	21
the	21
Court;	21
for	21
a	21
loaf	21
costs	21
a	21
real,	21
and	21
meat	21
thirty	21
maravedis	21
a	21
pound,	21
which	21
is	21
beyond	21
everything;	21
and	21
if	21
he	21
does	21
not	21
want	21
me	21
to	21
go	21
let	21
him	21
tell	21
me	21
in	21
time,	21
for	21
my	21
feet	21
are	21
on	21
the	21
fidgets	21
to	21
be	21
off;	21
and	21
my	21
friends	21
and	21
neighbours	21
tell	21
me	21
that	21
if	21
my	21
daughter	21
and	21
I	21
make	21
a	21
figure	21
and	21
a	21
brave	21
show	21
at	21
Court,	21
my	21
husband	21
will	21
come	21
to	21
be	21
known	21
far	21
more	21
by	21
me	21
than	21
I	21
by	21
him,	21
for	21
of	21
course	21
plenty	21
of	21
people	21
will	21
ask,	21
“Who	21
are	21
those	21
ladies	21
in	21
that	21
coach?”	21
and	21
some	21
servant	21
of	21
mine	21
will	21
answer,	21
“The	21
wife	21
and	21
daughter	21
of	21
Sancho	21
Panza,	21
governor	21
of	21
the	21
island	21
of	21
Barataria;”	21
and	21
in	21
this	21
way	21
Sancho	21
will	21
become	21
known,	21
and	21
I’ll	21
be	21
thought	21
well	21
of,	21
and	21
“to	21
Rome	21
for	21
everything.”	21
I	21
am	21
as	21
vexed	21
as	21
vexed	21
can	21
be	21
that	21
they	21
have	21
gathered	21
no	21
acorns	21
this	21
year	21
in	21
our	21
village;	21
for	21
all	21
that	21
I	21
send	21
your	21
highness	21
about	21
half	21
a	21
peck	21
that	21
I	21
went	21
to	21
the	21
wood	21
to	21
gather	21
and	21
pick	21
out	21
one	21
by	21
one	21
myself,	21
and	21
I	21
could	21
find	21
no	21
bigger	21
ones;	21
I	21
wish	21
they	21
were	21
as	21
big	21
as	21
ostrich	21
eggs.	21
Let	21
not	21
your	21
high	21
mightiness	21
forget	21
to	21
write	21
to	21
me;	21
and	21
I	21
will	21
take	21
care	21
to	21
answer,	21
and	21
let	21
you	21
know	21
how	21
I	21
am,	21
and	21
whatever	21
news	21
there	21
may	21
be	21
in	21
this	21
place,	21
where	21
I	21
remain,	21
praying	21
our	21
Lord	21
to	21
have	21
your	21
highness	21
in	21
his	21
keeping	21
and	21
not	21
to	21
forget	21
me.	21
Sancha	21
my	21
daughter,	21
and	21
my	21
son,	21
kiss	21
your	21
worship’s	21
hands.	21
She	21
who	21
would	21
rather	21
see	21
your	21
ladyship	21
than	21
write	21
to	21
you,	21
Your	21
servant,	21
TERESA	21
PANZA.	21
All	21
were	21
greatly	21
amused	21
by	21
Teresa	21
Panza’s	21
letter,	21
but	21
particularly	21
the	21
duke	21
and	21
duchess;	21
and	21
the	21
duchess	21
asked	21
Don	21
Quixote’s	21
opinion	21
whether	21
they	21
might	21
open	21
the	21
letter	21
that	21
had	21
come	21
for	21
the	21
governor,	21
which	21
she	21
suspected	21
must	21
be	21
very	21
good.	21
Don	21
Quixote	21
said	21
that	21
to	21
gratify	21
them	21
he	21
would	21
open	21
it,	21
and	21
did	21
so,	21
and	21
found	21
that	21
it	21
ran	21
as	21
follows.	21
TERESA	21
PANZA’S	21
LETTER	21
TO	21
HER	21
HUSBAND	21
SANCHO	21
PANZA.	21
I	21
got	21
thy	21
letter,	21
Sancho	21
of	21
my	21
soul,	21
and	21
I	21
promise	21
thee	21
and	21
swear	21
as	21
a	21
Catholic	21
Christian	21
that	21
I	21
was	21
within	21
two	21
fingers’	21
breadth	21
of	21
going	21
mad	21
I	21
was	21
so	21
happy.	21
I	21
can	21
tell	21
thee,	21
brother,	21
when	21
I	21
came	21
to	21
hear	21
that	21
thou	21
wert	21
a	21
governor	21
I	21
thought	21
I	21
should	21
have	21
dropped	21
dead	21
with	21
pure	21
joy;	21
and	21
thou	21
knowest	21
they	21
say	21
sudden	21
joy	21
kills	21
as	21
well	21
as	21
great	21
sorrow;	21
and	21
as	21
for	21
Sanchica	21
thy	21
daughter,	21
she	21
leaked	21
from	21
sheer	21
happiness.	21
I	21
had	21
before	21
me	21
the	21
suit	21
thou	21
didst	21
send	21
me,	21
and	21
the	21
coral	21
beads	21
my	21
lady	21
the	21
duchess	21
sent	21
me	21
round	21
my	21
neck,	21
and	21
the	21
letters	21
in	21
my	21
hands,	21
and	21
there	21
was	21
the	21
bearer	21
of	21
them	21
standing	21
by,	21
and	21
in	21
spite	21
of	21
all	21
this	21
I	21
verily	21
believed	21
and	21
thought	21
that	21
what	21
I	21
saw	21
and	21
handled	21
was	21
all	21
a	21
dream;	21
for	21
who	21
could	21
have	21
thought	21
that	21
a	21
goatherd	21
would	21
come	21
to	21
be	21
a	21
governor	21
of	21
islands?	21
Thou	21
knowest,	21
my	21
friend,	21
what	21
my	21
mother	21
used	21
to	21
say,	21
that	21
one	21
must	21
live	21
long	21
to	21
see	21
much;	21
I	21
say	21
it	21
because	21
I	21
expect	21
to	21
see	21
more	21
if	21
I	21
live	21
longer;	21
for	21
I	21
don’t	21
expect	21
to	21
stop	21
until	21
I	21
see	21
thee	21
a	21
farmer	21
of	21
taxes	21
or	21
a	21
collector	21
of	21
revenue,	21
which	21
are	21
offices	21
where,	21
though	21
the	21
devil	21
carries	21
off	21
those	21
who	21
make	21
a	21
bad	21
use	21
of	21
them,	21
still	21
they	21
make	21
and	21
handle	21
money.	21
My	21
lady	21
the	21
duchess	21
will	21
tell	21
thee	21
the	21
desire	21
I	21
have	21
to	21
go	21
to	21
the	21
Court;	21
consider	21
the	21
matter	21
and	21
let	21
me	21
know	21
thy	21
pleasure;	21
I	21
will	21
try	21
to	21
do	21
honour	21
to	21
thee	21
by	21
going	21
in	21
a	21
coach.	21
Neither	21
the	21
curate,	21
nor	21
the	21
barber,	21
nor	21
the	21
bachelor,	21
nor	21
even	21
the	21
sacristan,	21
can	21
believe	21
that	21
thou	21
art	21
a	21
governor,	21
and	21
they	21
say	21
the	21
whole	21
thing	21
is	21
a	21
delusion	21
or	21
an	21
enchantment	21
affair,	21
like	21
everything	21
belonging	21
to	21
thy	21
master	21
Don	21
Quixote;	21
and	21
Samson	21
says	21
he	21
must	21
go	21
in	21
search	21
of	21
thee	21
and	21
drive	21
the	21
government	21
out	21
of	21
thy	21
head	21
and	21
the	21
madness	21
out	21
of	21
Don	21
Quixote’s	21
skull;	21
I	21
only	21
laugh,	21
and	21
look	21
at	21
my	21
string	21
of	21
beads,	21
and	21
plan	21
out	21
the	21
dress	21
I	21
am	21
going	21
to	21
make	21
for	21
our	21
daughter	21
out	21
of	21
thy	21
suit.	21
I	21
sent	21
some	21
acorns	21
to	21
my	21
lady	21
the	21
duchess;	21
I	21
wish	21
they	21
had	21
been	21
gold.	21
Send	21
me	21
some	21
strings	21
of	21
pearls	21
if	21
they	21
are	21
in	21
fashion	21
in	21
that	21
island.	21
Here	21
is	21
the	21
news	21
of	21
the	21
village;	21
La	21
Berrueca	21
has	21
married	21
her	21
daughter	21
to	21
a	21
good-for-nothing	21
painter,	21
who	21
came	21
here	21
to	21
paint	21
anything	21
that	21
might	21
turn	21
up.	21
The	21
council	21
gave	21
him	21
an	21
order	21
to	21
paint	21
his	21
Majesty’s	21
arms	21
over	21
the	21
door	21
of	21
the	21
town-hall;	21
he	21
asked	21
two	21
ducats,	21
which	21
they	21
paid	21
him	21
in	21
advance;	21
he	21
worked	21
for	21
eight	21
days,	21
and	21
at	21
the	21
end	21
of	21
them	21
had	21
nothing	21
painted,	21
and	21
then	21
said	21
he	21
had	21
no	21
turn	21
for	21
painting	21
such	21
trifling	21
things;	21
he	21
returned	21
the	21
money,	21
and	21
for	21
all	21
that	21
has	21
married	21
on	21
the	21
pretence	21
of	21
being	21
a	21
good	21
workman;	21
to	21
be	21
sure	21
he	21
has	21
now	21
laid	21
aside	21
his	21
paint-brush	21
and	21
taken	21
a	21
spade	21
in	21
hand,	21
and	21
goes	21
to	21
the	21
field	21
like	21
a	21
gentleman.	21
Pedro	21
Lobo’s	21
son	21
has	21
received	21
the	21
first	21
orders	21
and	21
tonsure,	21
with	21
the	21
intention	21
of	21
becoming	21
a	21
priest.	21
Minguilla,	21
Mingo	21
Silvato’s	21
granddaughter,	21
found	21
it	21
out,	21
and	21
has	21
gone	21
to	21
law	21
with	21
him	21
on	21
the	21
score	21
of	21
having	21
given	21
her	21
promise	21
of	21
marriage.	21
Evil	21
tongues	21
say	21
she	21
is	21
with	21
child	21
by	21
him,	21
but	21
he	21
denies	21
it	21
stoutly.	21
There	21
are	21
no	21
olives	21
this	21
year,	21
and	21
there	21
is	21
not	21
a	21
drop	21
of	21
vinegar	21
to	21
be	21
had	21
in	21
the	21
whole	21
village.	21
A	21
company	21
of	21
soldiers	21
passed	21
through	21
here;	21
when	21
they	21
left	21
they	21
took	21
away	21
with	21
them	21
three	21
of	21
the	21
girls	21
of	21
the	21
village;	21
I	21
will	21
not	21
tell	21
thee	21
who	21
they	21
are;	21
perhaps	21
they	21
will	21
come	21
back,	21
and	21
they	21
will	21
be	21
sure	21
to	21
find	21
those	21
who	21
will	21
take	21
them	21
for	21
wives	21
with	21
all	21
their	21
blemishes,	21
good	21
or	21
bad.	21
Sanchica	21
is	21
making	21
bonelace;	21
she	21
earns	21
eight	21
maravedis	21
a	21
day	21
clear,	21
which	21
she	21
puts	21
into	21
a	21
moneybox	21
as	21
a	21
help	21
towards	21
house	21
furnishing;	21
but	21
now	21
that	21
she	21
is	21
a	21
governor’s	21
daughter	21
thou	21
wilt	21
give	21
her	21
a	21
portion	21
without	21
her	21
working	21
for	21
it.	21
The	21
fountain	21
in	21
the	21
plaza	21
has	21
run	21
dry.	21
A	21
flash	21
of	21
lightning	21
struck	21
the	21
gibbet,	21
and	21
I	21
wish	21
they	21
all	21
lit	21
there.	21
I	21
look	21
for	21
an	21
answer	21
to	21
this,	21
and	21
to	21
know	21
thy	21
mind	21
about	21
my	21
going	21
to	21
the	21
Court;	21
and	21
so,	21
God	21
keep	21
thee	21
longer	21
than	21
me,	21
or	21
as	21
long,	21
for	21
I	21
would	21
not	21
leave	21
thee	21
in	21
this	21
world	21
without	21
me.	21
Thy	21
wife,	21
TERESA	21
PANZA.	21
The	21
letters	21
were	21
applauded,	21
laughed	21
over,	21
relished,	21
and	21
admired;	21
and	21
then,	21
as	21
if	21
to	21
put	21
the	21
seal	21
to	21
the	21
business,	21
the	21
courier	21
arrived,	21
bringing	21
the	21
one	21
Sancho	21
sent	21
to	21
Don	21
Quixote,	21
and	21
this,	21
too,	21
was	21
read	21
out,	21
and	21
it	21
raised	21
some	21
doubts	21
as	21
to	21
the	21
governor’s	21
simplicity.	21
The	21
duchess	21
withdrew	21
to	21
hear	21
from	21
the	21
page	21
about	21
his	21
adventures	21
in	21
Sancho’s	21
village,	21
which	21
he	21
narrated	21
at	21
full	21
length	21
without	21
leaving	21
a	21
single	21
circumstance	21
unmentioned.	21
He	21
gave	21
her	21
the	21
acorns,	21
and	21
also	21
a	21
cheese	21
which	21
Teresa	21
had	21
given	21
him	21
as	21
being	21
particularly	21
good	21
and	21
superior	21
to	21
those	21
of	21
Tronchon.	21
The	21
duchess	21
received	21
it	21
with	21
greatest	21
delight,	21
in	21
which	21
we	21
will	21
leave	21
her,	21
to	21
describe	21
the	21
end	21
of	21
the	21
government	21
of	21
the	21
great	21
Sancho	21
Panza,	21
flower	21
and	21
mirror	21
of	21
all	21
governors	21
of	21
islands.	21

anything	21

in	21
it	21
everything	21
seems	21
to	21
go	21
in	21
a	21
circle,	21
I	21
mean	21
round	21
and	21
round.	21
The	21
spring	21
succeeds	21
the	21
summer,	21
the	21
summer	21
the	21
fall,	21
the	21
fall	21
the	21
autumn,	21
the	21
autumn	21
the	21
winter,	21
and	21
the	21
winter	21
the	21
spring,	21
and	21
so	21
time	21
rolls	21
with	21
never-ceasing	21
wheel.	21
Man’s	21
life	21
alone,	21
swifter	21
than	21
time,	21
speeds	21
onward	21
to	21
its	21
end	21
without	21
any	21
hope	21
of	21
renewal,	21
save	21
it	21
be	21
in	21
that	21
other	21
life	21
which	21
is	21
endless	21
and	21
boundless.	21
Thus	21
saith	21
Cide	21
Hamete	21
the	21
Mahometan	21
philosopher;	21
for	21
there	21
are	21
many	21
that	21
by	21
the	21
light	21
of	21
nature	21
alone,	21
without	21
the	21
light	21
of	21
faith,	21
have	21
a	21
comprehension	21
of	21
the	21
fleeting	21
nature	21
and	21
instability	21
of	21
this	21
present	21
life	21
and	21
the	21
endless	21
duration	21
of	21
that	21
eternal	21
life	21
we	21
hope	21
for;	21
but	21
our	21
author	21
is	21
here	21
speaking	21
of	21
the	21
rapidity	21
with	21
which	21
Sancho’s	21
government	21
came	21
to	21
an	21
end,	21
melted	21
away,	21
disappeared,	21
vanished	21
as	21
it	21
were	21
in	21
smoke	21
and	21
shadow.	21
For	21
as	21
he	21
lay	21
in	21
bed	21
on	21
the	21
night	21
of	21
the	21
seventh	21
day	21
of	21
his	21
government,	21
sated,	21
not	21
with	21
bread	21
and	21
wine,	21
but	21
with	21
delivering	21
judgments	21
and	21
giving	21
opinions	21
and	21
making	21
laws	21
and	21
proclamations,	21
just	21
as	21
sleep,	21
in	21
spite	21
of	21
hunger,	21
was	21
beginning	21
to	21
close	21
his	21
eyelids,	21
he	21
heard	21
such	21
a	21
noise	21
of	21
bell-ringing	21
and	21
shouting	21
that	21
one	21
would	21
have	21
fancied	21
the	21
whole	21
island	21
was	21
going	21
to	21
the	21
bottom.	21
He	21
sat	21
up	21
in	21
bed	21
and	21
remained	21
listening	21
intently	21
to	21
try	21
if	21
he	21
could	21
make	21
out	21
what	21
could	21
be	21
the	21
cause	21
of	21
so	21
great	21
an	21
uproar;	21
not	21
only,	21
however,	21
was	21
he	21
unable	21
to	21
discover	21
what	21
it	21
was,	21
but	21
as	21
countless	21
drums	21
and	21
trumpets	21
now	21
helped	21
to	21
swell	21
the	21
din	21
of	21
the	21
bells	21
and	21
shouts,	21
he	21
was	21
more	21
puzzled	21
than	21
ever,	21
and	21
filled	21
with	21
fear	21
and	21
terror;	21
and	21
getting	21
up	21
he	21
put	21
on	21
a	21
pair	21
of	21
slippers	21
because	21
of	21
the	21
dampness	21
of	21
the	21
floor,	21
and	21
without	21
throwing	21
a	21
dressing	21
gown	21
or	21
anything	21
of	21
the	21
kind	21
over	21
him	21
he	21
rushed	21
out	21
of	21
the	21
door	21
of	21
his	21
room,	21
just	21
in	21
time	21
to	21
see	21
approaching	21
along	21
a	21
corridor	21
a	21
band	21
of	21
more	21
than	21
twenty	21
persons	21
with	21
lighted	21
torches	21
and	21
naked	21
swords	21
in	21
their	21
hands,	21
all	21
shouting	21
out,	21
“To	21
arms,	21
to	21
arms,	21
señor	21
governor,	21
to	21
arms!	21
The	21
enemy	21
is	21
in	21
the	21
island	21
in	21
countless	21
numbers,	21
and	21
we	21
are	21
lost	21
unless	21
your	21
skill	21
and	21
valour	21
come	21
to	21
our	21
support.”	21
Keeping	21
up	21
this	21
noise,	21
tumult,	21
and	21
uproar,	21
they	21
came	21
to	21
where	21
Sancho	21
stood	21
dazed	21
and	21
bewildered	21
by	21
what	21
he	21
saw	21
and	21
heard,	21
and	21
as	21
they	21
approached	21
one	21
of	21
them	21
called	21
out	21
to	21
him,	21
“Arm	21
at	21
once,	21
your	21
lordship,	21
if	21
you	21
would	21
not	21
have	21
yourself	21
destroyed	21
and	21
the	21
whole	21
island	21
lost.”	21
“What	21
have	21
I	21
to	21
do	21
with	21
arming?”	21
said	21
Sancho.	21
“What	21
do	21
I	21
know	21
about	21
arms	21
or	21
supports?	21
Better	21
leave	21
all	21
that	21
to	21
my	21
master	21
Don	21
Quixote,	21
who	21
will	21
settle	21
it	21
and	21
make	21
all	21
safe	21
in	21
a	21
trice;	21
for	21
I,	21
sinner	21
that	21
I	21
am,	21
God	21
help	21
me,	21
don’t	21
understand	21
these	21
scuffles.”	21
“Ah,	21
señor	21
governor,”	21
said	21
another,	21
“what	21
slackness	21
of	21
mettle	21
this	21
is!	21
Arm	21
yourself;	21
here	21
are	21
arms	21
for	21
you,	21
offensive	21
and	21
defensive;	21
come	21
out	21
to	21
the	21
plaza	21
and	21
be	21
our	21
leader	21
and	21
captain;	21
it	21
falls	21
upon	21
you	21
by	21
right,	21
for	21
you	21
are	21
our	21
governor.”	21
“Arm	21
me	21
then,	21
in	21
God’s	21
name,”	21
said	21
Sancho,	21
and	21
they	21
at	21
once	21
produced	21
two	21
large	21
shields	21
they	21
had	21
come	21
provided	21
with,	21
and	21
placed	21
them	21
upon	21
him	21
over	21
his	21
shirt,	21
without	21
letting	21
him	21
put	21
on	21
anything	21
else,	21
one	21
shield	21
in	21
front	21
and	21
the	21
other	21
behind,	21
and	21
passing	21
his	21
arms	21
through	21
openings	21
they	21
had	21
made,	21
they	21
bound	21
him	21
tight	21
with	21
ropes,	21
so	21
that	21
there	21
he	21
was	21
walled	21
and	21
boarded	21
up	21
as	21
straight	21
as	21
a	21
spindle	21
and	21
unable	21
to	21
bend	21
his	21
knees	21
or	21
stir	21
a	21
single	21
step.	21
In	21
his	21
hand	21
they	21
placed	21
a	21
lance,	21
on	21
which	21
he	21
leant	21
to	21
keep	21
himself	21
from	21
falling,	21
and	21
as	21
soon	21
as	21
they	21
had	21
him	21
thus	21
fixed	21
they	21
bade	21
him	21
march	21
forward	21
and	21
lead	21
them	21
on	21
and	21
give	21
them	21
all	21
courage;	21
for	21
with	21
him	21
for	21
their	21
guide	21
and	21
lamp	21
and	21
morning	21
star,	21
they	21
were	21
sure	21
to	21
bring	21
their	21
business	21
to	21
a	21
successful	21
issue.	21

“How	21
am	21
I	21
to	21
march,	21
unlucky	21
being	21
that	21
I	21
am?”	21
said	21
Sancho,	21
“when	21
I	21
can’t	21
stir	21
my	21
knee-caps,	21
for	21
these	21
boards	21
I	21
have	21
bound	21
so	21
tight	21
to	21
my	21
body	21
won’t	21
let	21
me.	21
What	21
you	21
must	21
do	21
is	21
carry	21
me	21
in	21
your	21
arms,	21
and	21
lay	21
me	21
across	21
or	21
set	21
me	21
upright	21
in	21
some	21
postern,	21
and	21
I’ll	21
hold	21
it	21
either	21
with	21
this	21
lance	21
or	21
with	21
my	21
body.”	21
“On,	21
señor	21
governor!”	21
cried	21
another,	21
“it	21
is	21
fear	21
more	21
than	21
the	21
boards	21
that	21
keeps	21
you	21
from	21
moving;	21
make	21
haste,	21
stir	21
yourself,	21
for	21
there	21
is	21
no	21
time	21
to	21
lose;	21
the	21
enemy	21
is	21
increasing	21
in	21
numbers,	21
the	21
shouts	21
grow	21
louder,	21
and	21
the	21
danger	21
is	21
pressing.”	21
Urged	21
by	21
these	21
exhortations	21
and	21
reproaches	21
the	21
poor	21
governor	21
made	21
an	21
attempt	21
to	21
advance,	21
but	21
fell	21
to	21
the	21
ground	21
with	21
such	21
a	21
crash	21
that	21
he	21
fancied	21
he	21
had	21
broken	21
himself	21
all	21
to	21
pieces.	21
There	21
he	21
lay	21
like	21
a	21
tortoise	21
enclosed	21
in	21
its	21
shell,	21
or	21
a	21
side	21
of	21
bacon	21
between	21
two	21
kneading-troughs,	21
or	21
a	21
boat	21
bottom	21
up	21
on	21
the	21
beach;	21
nor	21
did	21
the	21
gang	21
of	21
jokers	21
feel	21
any	21
compassion	21
for	21
him	21
when	21
they	21
saw	21
him	21
down;	21
so	21
far	21
from	21
that,	21
extinguishing	21
their	21
torches	21
they	21
began	21
to	21
shout	21
afresh	21
and	21
to	21
renew	21
the	21
calls	21
to	21
arms	21
with	21
such	21
energy,	21
trampling	21
on	21
poor	21
Sancho,	21
and	21
slashing	21
at	21
him	21
over	21
the	21
shield	21
with	21
their	21
swords	21
in	21
such	21
a	21
way	21
that,	21
if	21
he	21
had	21
not	21
gathered	21
himself	21
together	21
and	21
made	21
himself	21
small	21
and	21
drawn	21
in	21
his	21
head	21
between	21
the	21
shields,	21
it	21
would	21
have	21
fared	21
badly	21
with	21
the	21
poor	21
governor,	21
as,	21
squeezed	21
into	21
that	21
narrow	21
compass,	21
he	21
lay,	21
sweating	21
and	21
sweating	21
again,	21
and	21
commending	21
himself	21
with	21
all	21
his	21
heart	21
to	21
God	21
to	21
deliver	21
him	21
from	21
his	21
present	21
peril.	21
Some	21
stumbled	21
over	21
him,	21
others	21
fell	21
upon	21
him,	21
and	21
one	21
there	21
was	21
who	21
took	21
up	21
a	21
position	21
on	21
top	21
of	21
him	21
for	21
some	21
time,	21
and	21
from	21
thence	21
as	21
if	21
from	21
a	21
watchtower	21
issued	21
orders	21
to	21
the	21
troops,	21
shouting	21
out,	21
“Here,	21
our	21
side!	21
Here	21
the	21
enemy	21
is	21
thickest!	21
Hold	21
the	21
breach	21
there!	21
Shut	21
that	21
gate!	21
Barricade	21
those	21
ladders!	21
Here	21
with	21
your	21
stink-pots	21
of	21
pitch	21
and	21
resin,	21
and	21
kettles	21
of	21
boiling	21
oil!	21
Block	21
the	21
streets	21
with	21
feather	21
beds!”	21
In	21
short,	21
in	21
his	21
ardour	21
he	21
mentioned	21
every	21
little	21
thing,	21
and	21
every	21
implement	21
and	21
engine	21
of	21
war	21
by	21
means	21
of	21
which	21
an	21
assault	21
upon	21
a	21
city	21
is	21
warded	21
off,	21
while	21
the	21
bruised	21
and	21
battered	21
Sancho,	21
who	21
heard	21
and	21
suffered	21
all,	21
was	21
saying	21
to	21
himself,	21
“O	21
if	21
it	21
would	21
only	21
please	21
the	21
Lord	21
to	21
let	21
the	21
island	21
be	21
lost	21
at	21
once,	21
and	21
I	21
could	21
see	21
myself	21
either	21
dead	21
or	21
out	21
of	21
this	21
torture!”	21
Heaven	21
heard	21
his	21
prayer,	21
and	21
when	21
he	21
least	21
expected	21
it	21
he	21
heard	21
voices	21
exclaiming,	21
“Victory,	21
victory!	21
The	21
enemy	21
retreats	21
beaten!	21
Come,	21
señor	21
governor,	21
get	21
up,	21
and	21
come	21
and	21
enjoy	21
the	21
victory,	21
and	21
divide	21
the	21
spoils	21
that	21
have	21
been	21
won	21
from	21
the	21
foe	21
by	21
the	21
might	21
of	21
that	21
invincible	21
arm.”	21
“Lift	21
me	21
up,”	21
said	21
the	21
wretched	21
Sancho	21
in	21
a	21
woebegone	21
voice.	21
They	21
helped	21
him	21
to	21
rise,	21
and	21
as	21
soon	21
as	21
he	21
was	21
on	21
his	21
feet	21
said,	21
“The	21
enemy	21
I	21
have	21
beaten	21
you	21
may	21
nail	21
to	21
my	21
forehead;	21
I	21
don’t	21
want	21
to	21
divide	21
the	21
spoils	21
of	21
the	21
foe,	21
I	21
only	21
beg	21
and	21
entreat	21
some	21
friend,	21
if	21
I	21
have	21
one,	21
to	21
give	21
me	21
a	21
sup	21
of	21
wine,	21
for	21
I’m	21
parched	21
with	21
thirst,	21
and	21
wipe	21
me	21
dry,	21
for	21
I’m	21
turning	21
to	21
water.”	21
They	21
rubbed	21
him	21
down,	21
fetched	21
him	21
wine	21
and	21
unbound	21
the	21
shields,	21
and	21
he	21
seated	21
himself	21
upon	21
his	21
bed,	21
and	21
with	21
fear,	21
agitation,	21
and	21
fatigue	21
he	21
fainted	21
away.	21
Those	21
who	21
had	21
been	21
concerned	21
in	21
the	21
joke	21
were	21
now	21
sorry	21
they	21
had	21
pushed	21
it	21
so	21
far;	21
however,	21
the	21
anxiety	21
his	21
fainting	21
away	21
had	21
caused	21
them	21
was	21
relieved	21
by	21
his	21
returning	21
to	21
himself.	21
He	21
asked	21
what	21
o’clock	21
it	21
was;	21
they	21
told	21
him	21
it	21
was	21
just	21
daybreak.	21
He	21
said	21
no	21
more,	21
and	21
in	21
silence	21
began	21
to	21
dress	21
himself,	21
while	21
all	21
watched	21
him,	21
waiting	21

the	21
haste	21
with	21
which	21
he	21
was	21
putting	21
on	21
his	21
clothes	21
meant.	21

He	21
got	21
himself	21
dressed	21
at	21
last,	21
and	21
then,	21
slowly,	21
for	21
he	21
was	21
sorely	21
bruised	21
and	21
could	21
not	21
go	21
fast,	21
he	21
proceeded	21
to	21
the	21
stable,	21
followed	21
by	21
all	21
who	21
were	21
present,	21
and	21
going	21
up	21
to	21
Dapple	21
embraced	21
him	21
and	21
gave	21
him	21
a	21
loving	21
kiss	21
on	21
the	21
forehead,	21
and	21
said	21
to	21
him,	21
not	21
without	21
tears	21
in	21
his	21
eyes,	21
“Come	21
along,	21
comrade	21
and	21
friend	21
and	21
partner	21
of	21
my	21
toils	21
and	21
sorrows;	21
when	21
I	21
was	21
with	21
you	21
and	21
had	21
no	21
cares	21
to	21
trouble	21
me	21
except	21
mending	21
your	21
harness	21
and	21
feeding	21
your	21
little	21
carcass,	21
happy	21
were	21
my	21
hours,	21
my	21
days,	21
and	21
my	21
years;	21
but	21
since	21
I	21
left	21
you,	21
and	21
mounted	21
the	21
towers	21
of	21
ambition	21
and	21
pride,	21
a	21
thousand	21
miseries,	21
a	21
thousand	21
troubles,	21
and	21
four	21
thousand	21
anxieties	21
have	21
entered	21
into	21
my	21
soul;”	21
and	21
all	21
the	21
while	21
he	21
was	21
speaking	21
in	21
this	21
strain	21
he	21
was	21
fixing	21
the	21
pack-saddle	21
on	21
the	21
ass,	21
without	21
a	21
word	21
from	21
anyone.	21
Then	21
having	21
Dapple	21
saddled,	21
he,	21
with	21
great	21
pain	21
and	21
difficulty,	21
got	21
up	21
on	21
him,	21
and	21
addressing	21
himself	21
to	21
the	21
majordomo,	21
the	21
secretary,	21
the	21
head-carver,	21
and	21
Pedro	21
Recio	21
the	21
doctor	21
and	21
several	21
others	21
who	21
stood	21
by,	21
he	21
said,	21
“Make	21
way,	21
gentlemen,	21
and	21
let	21
me	21
go	21
back	21
to	21
my	21
old	21
freedom;	21
let	21
me	21
go	21
look	21
for	21
my	21
past	21
life,	21
and	21
raise	21
myself	21
up	21
from	21
this	21
present	21
death.	21
I	21
was	21
not	21
born	21
to	21
be	21
a	21
governor	21
or	21
protect	21
islands	21
or	21
cities	21
from	21
the	21
enemies	21
that	21
choose	21
to	21
attack	21
them.	21
Ploughing	21
and	21
digging,	21
vinedressing	21
and	21
pruning,	21
are	21
more	21
in	21
my	21
way	21
than	21
defending	21
provinces	21
or	21
kingdoms.	21
Saint	21
Peter	21
is	21
very	21
well	21
at	21
Rome;	21
I	21
mean	21
each	21
of	21
us	21
is	21
best	21
following	21
the	21
trade	21
he	21
was	21
born	21
to.	21
A	21
reaping-hook	21
fits	21
my	21
hand	21
better	21
than	21
a	21
governor’s	21
sceptre;	21
I’d	21
rather	21
have	21
my	21
fill	21
of	21
gazpacho	21
than	21
be	21
subject	21
to	21
the	21
misery	21
of	21
a	21
meddling	21
doctor	21
who	21
kills	21
me	21
with	21
hunger,	21
and	21
I’d	21
rather	21
lie	21
in	21
summer	21
under	21
the	21
shade	21
of	21
an	21
oak,	21
and	21
in	21
winter	21
wrap	21
myself	21
in	21
a	21
double	21
sheepskin	21
jacket	21
in	21
freedom,	21
than	21
go	21
to	21
bed	21
between	21
holland	21
sheets	21
and	21
dress	21
in	21
sables	21
under	21
the	21
restraint	21
of	21
a	21
government.	21
God	21
be	21
with	21
your	21
worships,	21
and	21
tell	21
my	21
lord	21
the	21
duke	21
that	21
‘naked	21
I	21
was	21
born,	21
naked	21
I	21
find	21
myself,	21
I	21
neither	21
lose	21
nor	21
gain;’	21
I	21
mean	21
that	21
without	21
a	21
farthing	21
I	21
came	21
into	21
this	21
government,	21
and	21
without	21
a	21
farthing	21
I	21
go	21
out	21
of	21
it,	21
very	21
different	21
from	21
the	21
way	21
governors	21
commonly	21
leave	21
other	21
islands.	21
Stand	21
aside	21
and	21
let	21
me	21
go;	21
I	21
have	21
to	21
plaster	21
myself,	21
for	21
I	21
believe	21
every	21
one	21
of	21
my	21
ribs	21
is	21
crushed,	21
thanks	21
to	21
the	21
enemies	21
that	21
have	21
been	21
trampling	21
over	21
me	21
to-night.”	21
“That	21
is	21
unnecessary,	21
señor	21
governor,”	21
said	21
Doctor	21
Recio,	21
“for	21
I	21
will	21
give	21
your	21
worship	21
a	21
draught	21
against	21
falls	21
and	21
bruises	21
that	21
will	21
soon	21
make	21
you	21
as	21
sound	21
and	21
strong	21
as	21
ever;	21
and	21
as	21
for	21
your	21
diet	21
I	21
promise	21
your	21
worship	21
to	21
behave	21
better,	21
and	21
let	21
you	21
eat	21
plentifully	21
of	21
whatever	21
you	21
like.”	21
“You	21
spoke	21
late,”	21
said	21
Sancho.	21
“I’d	21
as	21
soon	21
turn	21
Turk	21
as	21
stay	21
any	21
longer.	21
Those	21
jokes	21
won’t	21
pass	21
a	21
second	21
time.	21
By	21
God	21
I’d	21
as	21
soon	21
remain	21
in	21
this	21
government,	21
or	21
take	21
another,	21
even	21
if	21
it	21
was	21
offered	21
me	21
between	21
two	21
plates,	21
as	21
fly	21
to	21
heaven	21
without	21
wings.	21
I	21
am	21
of	21
the	21
breed	21
of	21
the	21
Panzas,	21
and	21
they	21
are	21
every	21
one	21
of	21
them	21
obstinate,	21
and	21
if	21
they	21
once	21
say	21
‘odds,’	21
odds	21
it	21
must	21
be,	21
no	21
matter	21
if	21
it	21
is	21
evens,	21
in	21
spite	21
of	21
all	21
the	21
world.	21
Here	21
in	21
this	21
stable	21
I	21
leave	21
the	21
ant’s	21
wings	21
that	21
lifted	21
me	21
up	21
into	21
the	21
air	21
for	21
the	21
swifts	21
and	21
other	21
birds	21
to	21
eat	21
me,	21
and	21
let’s	21
take	21
to	21
level	21
ground	21
and	21
our	21
feet	21
once	21
more;	21
and	21
if	21
they’re	21
not	21
shod	21
in	21
pinked	21
shoes	21
of	21
cordovan,	21
they	21
won’t	21
want	21
for	21
rough	21
sandals	21
of	21
hemp;	21
‘every	21
ewe	21
to	21
her	21
like,’	21
‘and	21
let	21
no	21
one	21
stretch	21
his	21
leg	21
beyond	21
the	21
length	21
of	21
the	21
sheet;’	21
and	21
now	21
let	21
me	21
pass,	21
for	21
it’s	21
growing	21
late	21
with	21
me.”	21
To	21
this	21
the	21
majordomo	21
said,	21
“Señor	21
governor,	21
we	21
would	21
let	21
your	21
worship	21
go	21
with	21
all	21
our	21
hearts,	21
though	21
it	21
sorely	21
grieves	21
us	21
to	21
lose	21
you,	21
for	21
your	21
wit	21
and	21
Christian	21
conduct	21
naturally	21
make	21
us	21
regret	21
you;	21
but	21
it	21
is	21
well	21
known	21
that	21
every	21
governor,	21
before	21
he	21
leaves	21
the	21
place	21
where	21
he	21
has	21
been	21
governing,	21
is	21
bound	21
first	21
of	21
all	21
to	21
render	21
an	21
account.	21
Let	21
your	21
worship	21
do	21
so	21
for	21
the	21
ten	21
days	21
you	21
have	21
held	21
the	21
government,	21
and	21
then	21
you	21
may	21
go	21
and	21
the	21
peace	21
of	21
God	21
go	21
with	21
you.”	21
“No	21
one	21
can	21
demand	21
it	21
of	21
me,”	21
said	21
Sancho,	21
“but	21
he	21
whom	21
my	21
lord	21
the	21
duke	21
shall	21
appoint;	21
I	21
am	21
going	21
to	21
meet	21
him,	21
and	21
to	21
him	21
I	21
will	21
render	21
an	21
exact	21
one;	21
besides,	21
when	21
I	21
go	21
forth	21
naked	21
as	21
I	21
do,	21
there	21
is	21
no	21
other	21
proof	21
needed	21
to	21
show	21
that	21
I	21
have	21
governed	21
like	21
an	21
angel.”	21
“By	21
God	21
the	21
great	21
Sancho	21
is	21
right,”	21
said	21
Doctor	21
Recio,	21
“and	21
we	21
should	21
let	21
him	21
go,	21
for	21
the	21
duke	21
will	21
be	21
beyond	21
measure	21
glad	21
to	21
see	21
him.”	21
They	21
all	21
agreed	21
to	21
this,	21
and	21
allowed	21
him	21
to	21
go,	21
first	21
offering	21
to	21
bear	21
him	21
company	21
and	21
furnish	21
him	21
with	21
all	21
he	21
wanted	21
for	21
his	21
own	21
comfort	21
or	21
for	21
the	21
journey.	21
Sancho	21
said	21
he	21
did	21
not	21
want	21
anything	21
more	21
than	21
a	21
little	21
barley	21
for	21
Dapple,	21
and	21
half	21
a	21
cheese	21
and	21
half	21
a	21
loaf	21
for	21
himself;	21
for	21
the	21
distance	21
being	21
so	21
short	21
there	21
was	21
no	21
occasion	21
for	21
any	21
better	21
or	21
bulkier	21
provant.	21
They	21
all	21
embraced	21
him,	21
and	21
he	21
with	21
tears	21
embraced	21
all	21
of	21
them,	21
and	21
left	21
them	21
filled	21
with	21
admiration	21
not	21
only	21
at	21
his	21
remarks	21
but	21
at	21
his	21
firm	21
and	21
sensible	21
resolution.	21

The	21
duke	21
and	21
duchess	21
resolved	21
that	21
the	21
challenge	21
Don	21
Quixote	21
had,	21
for	21
the	21
reason	21
already	21
mentioned,	21
given	21
their	21
vassal,	21
should	21
be	21
proceeded	21
with;	21
and	21
as	21
the	21
young	21
man	21
was	21
in	21
Flanders,	21
whither	21
he	21
had	21
fled	21
to	21
escape	21
having	21
Doña	21
Rodriguez	21
for	21
a	21
mother-in-law,	21
they	21
arranged	21
to	21
substitute	21
for	21
him	21
a	21
Gascon	21
lacquey,	21
named	21
Tosilos,	21
first	21
of	21
all	21
carefully	21
instructing	21
him	21
in	21
all	21
he	21
had	21
to	21
do.	21
Two	21
days	21
later	21
the	21
duke	21
told	21
Don	21
Quixote	21
that	21
in	21
four	21
days	21
from	21
that	21
time	21
his	21
opponent	21
would	21
present	21
himself	21
on	21
the	21
field	21
of	21
battle	21
armed	21
as	21
a	21
knight,	21
and	21
would	21
maintain	21
that	21
the	21
damsel	21
lied	21
by	21
half	21
a	21
beard,	21
nay	21
a	21
whole	21
beard,	21
if	21
she	21
affirmed	21
that	21
he	21
had	21
given	21
her	21
a	21
promise	21
of	21
marriage.	21
Don	21
Quixote	21
was	21
greatly	21
pleased	21
at	21
the	21
news,	21
and	21
promised	21
himself	21
to	21
do	21
wonders	21
in	21
the	21
lists,	21
and	21
reckoned	21
it	21
rare	21
good	21
fortune	21
that	21
an	21
opportunity	21
should	21
have	21
offered	21
for	21
letting	21
his	21
noble	21
hosts	21
see	21
what	21
the	21
might	21
of	21
his	21
strong	21
arm	21
was	21
capable	21
of;	21
and	21
so	21
in	21
high	21
spirits	21
and	21
satisfaction	21
he	21
awaited	21
the	21
expiration	21
of	21
the	21
four	21
days,	21
which	21
measured	21
by	21
his	21
impatience	21
seemed	21
spinning	21
themselves	21
out	21
into	21
four	21
hundred	21
ages.	21
Let	21
us	21
leave	21
them	21
to	21
pass	21
as	21
we	21
do	21
other	21
things,	21
and	21
go	21
and	21
bear	21
Sancho	21
company,	21
as	21
mounted	21
on	21
Dapple,	21
half	21
glad,	21
half	21
sad,	21
he	21
paced	21
along	21
on	21
his	21
road	21
to	21
join	21
his	21
master,	21
in	21
whose	21
society	21
he	21
was	21
happier	21
than	21
in	21
being	21
governor	21
of	21
all	21
the	21
islands	21
in	21
the	21
world.	21
Well	21
then,	21
it	21
so	21
happened	21
that	21
before	21
he	21
had	21
gone	21
a	21
great	21
way	21
from	21
the	21
island	21
of	21
his	21
government	21
(and	21
whether	21
it	21
was	21
island,	21
city,	21
town,	21
or	21
village	21
that	21
he	21
governed	21
he	21
never	21
troubled	21
himself	21
to	21
inquire)	21
he	21
saw	21
coming	21
along	21
the	21
road	21
he	21
was	21
travelling	21
six	21
pilgrims	21
with	21
staves,	21
foreigners	21
of	21
that	21
sort	21
that	21
beg	21
for	21
alms	21
singing;	21
who	21
as	21
they	21
drew	21
near	21
arranged	21
themselves	21
in	21
a	21
line	21
and	21
lifting	21
up	21
their	21
voices	21
all	21
together	21
began	21
to	21
sing	21
in	21
their	21
own	21
language	21
something	21
that	21
Sancho	21
could	21
not	21
understand,	21
with	21
the	21
exception	21
of	21
one	21
word	21
which	21
sounded	21
plainly	21
“alms,”	21
from	21
which	21
he	21
gathered	21
that	21
it	21
was	21
alms	21
they	21
asked	21
for	21
in	21
their	21
song;	21
and	21
being,	21
as	21
Cide	21
Hamete	21
says,	21
remarkably	21
charitable,	21
he	21
took	21
out	21
of	21
his	21
alforjas	21
the	21
half	21
loaf	21
and	21
half	21
cheese	21
he	21
had	21
been	21
provided	21
with,	21
and	21
gave	21
them	21
to	21
them,	21
explaining	21
to	21
them	21
by	21
signs	21
that	21
he	21
had	21
nothing	21
else	21
to	21
give	21
them.	21
They	21
received	21
them	21
very	21
gladly,	21
but	21
exclaimed,	21
“Geld!	21
Geld!”	21
“I	21
don’t	21
understand	21
what	21
you	21
want	21
of	21
me,	21
good	21
people,”	21
said	21
Sancho.	21
On	21
this	21
one	21
of	21
them	21
took	21
a	21
purse	21
out	21
of	21
his	21
bosom	21
and	21
showed	21
it	21
to	21
Sancho,	21
by	21
which	21
he	21
comprehended	21
they	21
were	21
asking	21
for	21
money,	21
and	21
putting	21
his	21
thumb	21
to	21
his	21
throat	21
and	21
spreading	21
his	21
hand	21
upwards	21
he	21
gave	21
them	21
to	21
understand	21
that	21
he	21
had	21
not	21
the	21
sign	21
of	21
a	21
coin	21
about	21
him,	21
and	21
urging	21
Dapple	21
forward	21
he	21
broke	21
through	21
them.	21
But	21
as	21
he	21
was	21
passing,	21
one	21
of	21
them	21
who	21
had	21
been	21
examining	21
him	21
very	21
closely	21
rushed	21
towards	21
him,	21
and	21
flinging	21
his	21
arms	21
round	21
him	21
exclaimed	21
in	21
a	21
loud	21
voice	21
and	21
good	21
Spanish,	21
“God	21
bless	21
me!	21
What’s	21
this	21
I	21
see?	21
Is	21
it	21
possible	21
that	21
I	21
hold	21
in	21
my	21
arms	21
my	21
dear	21
friend,	21
my	21
good	21
neighbour	21
Sancho	21
Panza?	21
But	21
there’s	21
no	21
doubt	21
about	21
it,	21
for	21
I’m	21
not	21
asleep,	21
nor	21
am	21
I	21
drunk	21
just	21
now.”	21
Sancho	21
was	21
surprised	21
to	21
hear	21
himself	21
called	21
by	21
his	21
name	21
and	21
find	21
himself	21
embraced	21
by	21
a	21
foreign	21
pilgrim,	21
and	21
after	21
regarding	21
him	21
steadily	21
without	21
speaking	21
he	21
was	21
still	21
unable	21
to	21
recognise	21
him;	21
but	21
the	21
pilgrim	21
perceiving	21
his	21
perplexity	21
cried,	21
“What!	21
and	21
is	21
it	21
possible,	21
Sancho	21
Panza,	21
that	21
thou	21
dost	21
not	21
know	21
thy	21
neighbour	21
Ricote,	21
the	21
Morisco	21
shopkeeper	21
of	21
thy	21
village?”	21
Sancho	21
upon	21
this	21
looking	21
at	21
him	21
more	21
carefully	21
began	21
to	21
recall	21
his	21
features,	21
and	21
at	21
last	21
recognised	21
him	21
perfectly,	21
and	21
without	21
getting	21
off	21
the	21
ass	21
threw	21
his	21
arms	21
round	21
his	21
neck	21
saying,	21
“Who	21
the	21
devil	21
could	21
have	21
known	21
thee,	21
Ricote,	21
in	21
this	21
mummer’s	21
dress	21
thou	21
art	21
in?	21
Tell	21
me,	21
who	21
has	21
frenchified	21
thee,	21
and	21
how	21
dost	21
thou	21
dare	21
to	21
return	21
to	21
Spain,	21
where	21
if	21
they	21
catch	21
thee	21
and	21
recognise	21
thee	21
it	21
will	21
go	21
hard	21
enough	21
with	21
thee?”	21
“If	21
thou	21
dost	21
not	21
betray	21
me,	21
Sancho,”	21
said	21
the	21
pilgrim,	21
“I	21
am	21
safe;	21
for	21
in	21
this	21
dress	21
no	21
one	21
will	21
recognise	21
me;	21
but	21
let	21
us	21
turn	21
aside	21
out	21
of	21
the	21
road	21
into	21
that	21
grove	21
there	21
where	21
my	21
comrades	21
are	21
going	21
to	21
eat	21
and	21
rest,	21
and	21
thou	21
shalt	21
eat	21
with	21
them	21
there,	21
for	21
they	21
are	21
very	21
good	21
fellows;	21
I’ll	21
have	21
time	21
enough	21
to	21
tell	21
thee	21
then	21
all	21
that	21
has	21
happened	21
me	21
since	21
I	21
left	21
our	21
village	21
in	21
obedience	21
to	21
his	21
Majesty’s	21
edict	21
that	21
threatened	21
such	21
severities	21
against	21
the	21
unfortunate	21
people	21
of	21
my	21
nation,	21
as	21
thou	21
hast	21
heard.”	21
Sancho	21
complied,	21
and	21
Ricote	21
having	21
spoken	21
to	21
the	21
other	21
pilgrims	21
they	21
withdrew	21
to	21
the	21
grove	21
they	21
saw,	21
turning	21
a	21
considerable	21
distance	21
out	21
of	21
the	21
road.	21
They	21
threw	21
down	21
their	21
staves,	21
took	21
off	21
their	21
pilgrim’s	21
cloaks	21
and	21
remained	21
in	21
their	21
under-clothing;	21
they	21
were	21
all	21
good-looking	21
young	21
fellows,	21
except	21
Ricote,	21
who	21
was	21
a	21
man	21
somewhat	21
advanced	21
in	21
years.	21
They	21
carried	21
alforjas	21
all	21
of	21
them,	21
and	21
all	21
apparently	21
well	21
filled,	21
at	21
least	21
with	21
things	21
provocative	21
of	21
thirst,	21
such	21
as	21
would	21
summon	21
it	21
from	21
two	21
leagues	21
off.	21
They	21
stretched	21
themselves	21
on	21
the	21
ground,	21
and	21
making	21
a	21
tablecloth	21
of	21
the	21
grass	21
they	21
spread	21
upon	21
it	21
bread,	21
salt,	21
knives,	21
walnut,	21
scraps	21
of	21
cheese,	21
and	21
well-picked	21
ham-bones	21
which	21
if	21
they	21
were	21
past	21
gnawing	21
were	21
not	21
past	21
sucking.	21
They	21
also	21
put	21
down	21
a	21
black	21
dainty	21
called,	21
they	21
say,	21
caviar,	21
and	21
made	21
of	21
the	21
eggs	21
of	21
fish,	21
a	21
great	21
thirst-wakener.	21
Nor	21
was	21
there	21
any	21
lack	21
of	21
olives,	21
dry,	21
it	21
is	21
true,	21
and	21
without	21
any	21
seasoning,	21
but	21
for	21
all	21
that	21
toothsome	21
and	21
pleasant.	21
But	21
what	21
made	21
the	21
best	21
show	21
in	21
the	21
field	21
of	21
the	21
banquet	21
was	21
half	21
a	21
dozen	21
botas	21
of	21
wine,	21
for	21
each	21
of	21
them	21
produced	21
his	21
own	21
from	21
his	21
alforjas;	21
even	21
the	21
good	21
Ricote,	21
who	21
from	21
a	21
Morisco	21
had	21
transformed	21
himself	21
into	21
a	21
German	21
or	21
Dutchman,	21
took	21
out	21
his,	21
which	21
in	21
size	21
might	21
have	21
vied	21
with	21
the	21
five	21
others.	21
They	21
then	21
began	21
to	21
eat	21
with	21
very	21
great	21
relish	21
and	21
very	21
leisurely,	21
making	21
the	21
most	21
of	21
each	21
morsel—very	21
small	21
ones	21
of	21
everything—they	21
took	21
up	21
on	21
the	21
point	21
of	21
the	21
knife;	21
and	21
then	21
all	21
at	21
the	21
same	21
moment	21
raised	21
their	21
arms	21
and	21
botas	21
aloft,	21
the	21
mouths	21
placed	21
in	21
their	21
mouths,	21
and	21
all	21
eyes	21
fixed	21
on	21
heaven	21
just	21
as	21
if	21
they	21
were	21
taking	21
aim	21
at	21
it;	21
and	21
in	21
this	21
attitude	21
they	21
remained	21
ever	21
so	21
long,	21
wagging	21
their	21
heads	21
from	21
side	21
to	21
side	21
as	21
if	21
in	21
acknowledgment	21
of	21
the	21
pleasure	21
they	21
were	21
enjoying	21
while	21
they	21
decanted	21
the	21
bowels	21
of	21
the	21
bottles	21
into	21
their	21
own	21
stomachs.	21
Sancho	21
beheld	21
all,	21
“and	21
nothing	21
gave	21
him	21
pain;”	21
so	21
far	21
from	21
that,	21
acting	21
on	21
the	21
proverb	21
he	21
knew	21
so	21
well,	21
“when	21
thou	21
art	21
at	21
Rome	21
do	21
as	21
thou	21
seest,”	21
he	21
asked	21
Ricote	21
for	21
his	21
bota	21
and	21
took	21
aim	21
like	21
the	21
rest	21
of	21
them,	21
and	21
with	21
not	21
less	21
enjoyment.	21
Four	21
times	21
did	21
the	21
botas	21
bear	21
being	21
uplifted,	21
but	21
the	21
fifth	21
it	21
was	21
all	21
in	21
vain,	21
for	21
they	21
were	21
drier	21
and	21
more	21
sapless	21
than	21
a	21
rush	21
by	21
that	21
time,	21
which	21
made	21
the	21
jollity	21
that	21
had	21
been	21
kept	21
up	21
so	21
far	21
begin	21
to	21
flag.	21
Every	21
now	21
and	21
then	21
someone	21
of	21
them	21
would	21
grasp	21
Sancho’s	21
right	21
hand	21
in	21
his	21
own	21
saying,	21
“Español	21
y	21
Tudesqui	21
tuto	21
uno:	21
bon	21
compaño;”	21
and	21
Sancho	21
would	21
answer,	21
“Bon	21
compaño,	21
jur	21
a	21
Di!”	21
and	21
then	21
go	21
off	21
into	21
a	21
fit	21
of	21
laughter	21
that	21
lasted	21
an	21
hour,	21
without	21
a	21
thought	21
for	21
the	21
moment	21
of	21
anything	21
that	21
had	21
befallen	21
him	21
in	21
his	21
government;	21
for	21
cares	21
have	21
very	21
little	21
sway	21
over	21
us	21
while	21
we	21
are	21
eating	21
and	21
drinking.	21
At	21
length,	21
the	21
wine	21
having	21
come	21
to	21
an	21
end	21
with	21
them,	21
drowsiness	21
began	21
to	21
come	21
over	21
them,	21
and	21
they	21
dropped	21
asleep	21
on	21
their	21
very	21
table	21
and	21
tablecloth.	21
Ricote	21
and	21
Sancho	21
alone	21
remained	21
awake,	21
for	21
they	21
had	21
eaten	21
more	21
and	21
drunk	21
less,	21
and	21
Ricote	21
drawing	21
Sancho	21
aside,	21
they	21
seated	21
themselves	21
at	21
the	21
foot	21
of	21
a	21
beech,	21
leaving	21
the	21
pilgrims	21
buried	21
in	21
sweet	21
sleep;	21
and	21
without	21
once	21
falling	21
into	21
his	21
own	21
Morisco	21
tongue	21
Ricote	21
spoke	21
as	21
follows	21
in	21
pure	21
Castilian:	21
“Thou	21
knowest	21
well,	21
neighbour	21
and	21
friend	21
Sancho	21
Panza,	21
how	21
the	21
proclamation	21
or	21
edict	21
his	21
Majesty	21
commanded	21
to	21
be	21
issued	21
against	21
those	21
of	21
my	21
nation	21
filled	21
us	21
all	21
with	21
terror	21
and	21
dismay;	21
me	21
at	21
least	21
it	21
did,	21
insomuch	21
that	21
I	21
think	21
before	21
the	21
time	21
granted	21
us	21
for	21
quitting	21
Spain	21
was	21
out,	21
the	21
full	21
force	21
of	21
the	21
penalty	21
had	21
already	21
fallen	21
upon	21
me	21
and	21
upon	21
my	21
children.	21
I	21
decided,	21
then,	21
and	21
I	21
think	21
wisely	21
(just	21
like	21
one	21
who	21
knows	21
that	21
at	21
a	21
certain	21
date	21
the	21
house	21
he	21
lives	21
in	21
will	21
be	21
taken	21
from	21
him,	21
and	21
looks	21
out	21
beforehand	21
for	21
another	21
to	21
change	21
into),	21
I	21
decided,	21
I	21
say,	21
to	21
leave	21
the	21
town	21
myself,	21
alone	21
and	21
without	21
my	21
family,	21
and	21
go	21
to	21
seek	21
out	21
some	21
place	21
to	21
remove	21
them	21
to	21
comfortably	21
and	21
not	21
in	21
the	21
hurried	21
way	21
in	21
which	21
the	21
others	21
took	21
their	21
departure;	21
for	21
I	21
saw	21
very	21
plainly,	21
and	21
so	21
did	21
all	21
the	21
older	21
men	21
among	21
us,	21
that	21
the	21
proclamations	21
were	21
not	21
mere	21
threats,	21
as	21
some	21
said,	21
but	21
positive	21
enactments	21
which	21
would	21
be	21
enforced	21
at	21
the	21
appointed	21
time;	21
and	21
what	21
made	21
me	21
believe	21
this	21
was	21
what	21
I	21
knew	21
of	21
the	21
base	21
and	21
extravagant	21
designs	21
which	21
our	21
people	21
harboured,	21
designs	21
of	21
such	21
a	21
nature	21
that	21
I	21
think	21
it	21
was	21
a	21
divine	21
inspiration	21
that	21
moved	21
his	21
Majesty	21
to	21
carry	21
out	21
a	21
resolution	21
so	21
spirited;	21
not	21
that	21
we	21
were	21
all	21
guilty,	21
for	21
some	21
there	21
were	21
true	21
and	21
steadfast	21
Christians;	21
but	21
they	21
were	21
so	21
few	21
that	21
they	21
could	21
make	21
no	21
head	21
against	21
those	21
who	21
were	21
not;	21
and	21
it	21
was	21
not	21
prudent	21
to	21
cherish	21
a	21
viper	21
in	21
the	21
bosom	21
by	21
having	21
enemies	21
in	21
the	21
house.	21
In	21
short	21
it	21
was	21
with	21
just	21
cause	21
that	21
we	21
were	21
visited	21
with	21
the	21
penalty	21
of	21
banishment,	21
a	21
mild	21
and	21
lenient	21
one	21
in	21
the	21
eyes	21
of	21
some,	21
but	21
to	21
us	21
the	21
most	21
terrible	21
that	21
could	21
be	21
inflicted	21
upon	21
us.	21
Wherever	21
we	21
are	21
we	21
weep	21
for	21
Spain;	21
for	21
after	21
all	21
we	21
were	21
born	21
there	21
and	21
it	21
is	21
our	21
natural	21
fatherland.	21
Nowhere	21
do	21
we	21
find	21
the	21
reception	21
our	21
unhappy	21
condition	21
needs;	21
and	21
in	21
Barbary	21
and	21
all	21
the	21
parts	21
of	21
Africa	21
where	21
we	21
counted	21
upon	21
being	21
received,	21
succoured,	21
and	21
welcomed,	21
it	21
is	21
there	21
they	21
insult	21
and	21
ill-treat	21
us	21
most.	21
We	21
knew	21
not	21
our	21
good	21
fortune	21
until	21
we	21
lost	21
it;	21
and	21
such	21
is	21
the	21
longing	21
we	21
almost	21
all	21
of	21
us	21
have	21
to	21
return	21
to	21
Spain,	21
that	21
most	21
of	21
those	21
who	21
like	21
myself	21
know	21
the	21
language,	21
and	21
there	21
are	21
many	21
who	21
do,	21
come	21
back	21
to	21
it	21
and	21
leave	21
their	21
wives	21
and	21
children	21
forsaken	21
yonder,	21
so	21
great	21
is	21
their	21
love	21
for	21
it;	21
and	21
now	21
I	21
know	21
by	21
experience	21
the	21
meaning	21
of	21
the	21
saying,	21
sweet	21
is	21
the	21
love	21
of	21
one’s	21
country.	21
“I	21
left	21
our	21
village,	21
as	21
I	21
said,	21
and	21
went	21
to	21
France,	21
but	21
though	21
they	21
gave	21
us	21
a	21
kind	21
reception	21
there	21
I	21
was	21
anxious	21
to	21
see	21
all	21
I	21
could.	21
I	21
crossed	21
into	21
Italy,	21
and	21
reached	21
Germany,	21
and	21
there	21
it	21
seemed	21
to	21
me	21
we	21
might	21
live	21
with	21
more	21
freedom,	21
as	21
the	21
inhabitants	21
do	21
not	21
pay	21
any	21
attention	21
to	21
trifling	21
points;	21
everyone	21
lives	21
as	21
he	21
likes,	21
for	21
in	21
most	21
parts	21
they	21
enjoy	21
liberty	21
of	21
conscience.	21
I	21
took	21
a	21
house	21
in	21
a	21
town	21
near	21
Augsburg,	21
and	21
then	21
joined	21
these	21
pilgrims,	21
who	21
are	21
in	21
the	21
habit	21
of	21
coming	21
to	21
Spain	21
in	21
great	21
numbers	21
every	21
year	21
to	21
visit	21
the	21
shrines	21
there,	21
which	21
they	21
look	21
upon	21
as	21
their	21
Indies	21
and	21
a	21
sure	21
and	21
certain	21
source	21
of	21
gain.	21
They	21
travel	21
nearly	21
all	21
over	21
it,	21
and	21
there	21
is	21
no	21
town	21
out	21
of	21
which	21
they	21
do	21
not	21
go	21
full	21
up	21
of	21
meat	21
and	21
drink,	21
as	21
the	21
saying	21
is,	21
and	21
with	21
a	21
real,	21
at	21
least,	21
in	21
money,	21
and	21
they	21
come	21
off	21
at	21
the	21
end	21
of	21
their	21
travels	21
with	21
more	21
than	21
a	21
hundred	21
crowns	21
saved,	21
which,	21
changed	21
into	21
gold,	21
they	21
smuggle	21
out	21
of	21
the	21
kingdom	21
either	21
in	21
the	21
hollow	21
of	21
their	21
staves	21
or	21
in	21
the	21
patches	21
of	21
their	21
pilgrim’s	21
cloaks	21
or	21
by	21
some	21
device	21
of	21
their	21
own,	21
and	21
carry	21
to	21
their	21
own	21
country	21
in	21
spite	21
of	21
the	21
guards	21
at	21
the	21
posts	21
and	21
passes	21
where	21
they	21
are	21
searched.	21
Now	21
my	21
purpose	21
is,	21
Sancho,	21
to	21
carry	21
away	21
the	21
treasure	21
that	21
I	21
left	21
buried,	21
which,	21
as	21
it	21
is	21
outside	21
the	21
town,	21
I	21
shall	21
be	21
able	21
to	21
do	21
without	21
risk,	21
and	21
to	21
write,	21
or	21
cross	21
over	21
from	21
Valencia,	21
to	21
my	21
daughter	21
and	21
wife,	21
who	21
I	21
know	21
are	21
at	21
Algiers,	21
and	21
find	21
some	21
means	21
of	21
bringing	21
them	21
to	21
some	21
French	21
port	21
and	21
thence	21
to	21
Germany,	21
there	21
to	21
await	21
what	21
it	21
may	21
be	21
God’s	21
will	21
to	21
do	21
with	21
us;	21
for,	21
after	21
all,	21
Sancho,	21
I	21
know	21
well	21
that	21
Ricota	21
my	21
daughter	21
and	21
Francisca	21
Ricota	21
my	21
wife	21
are	21
Catholic	21
Christians,	21
and	21
though	21
I	21
am	21
not	21
so	21
much	21
so,	21
still	21
I	21
am	21
more	21
of	21
a	21
Christian	21
than	21
a	21
Moor,	21
and	21
it	21
is	21
always	21
my	21
prayer	21
to	21
God	21
that	21
he	21
will	21
open	21
the	21
eyes	21
of	21
my	21
understanding	21
and	21
show	21
me	21
how	21
I	21
am	21
to	21
serve	21
him;	21
but	21
what	21
amazes	21
me	21
and	21
I	21
cannot	21
understand	21
is	21
why	21
my	21
wife	21
and	21
daughter	21
should	21
have	21
gone	21
to	21
Barbary	21
rather	21
than	21
to	21
France,	21
where	21
they	21
could	21
live	21
as	21
Christians.”	21
To	21
this	21
Sancho	21
replied,	21
“Remember,	21
Ricote,	21
that	21
may	21
not	21
have	21
been	21
open	21
to	21
them,	21
for	21
Juan	21
Tiopieyo	21
thy	21
wife’s	21
brother	21
took	21
them,	21
and	21
being	21
a	21
true	21
Moor	21
he	21
went	21
where	21
he	21
could	21
go	21
most	21
easily;	21
and	21
another	21
thing	21
I	21
can	21
tell	21
thee,	21
it	21
is	21
my	21
belief	21
thou	21
art	21
going	21
in	21
vain	21
to	21
look	21
for	21
what	21
thou	21
hast	21
left	21
buried,	21
for	21
we	21
heard	21
they	21
took	21
from	21
thy	21
brother-in-law	21
and	21
thy	21
wife	21
a	21
great	21
quantity	21
of	21
pearls	21
and	21
money	21
in	21
gold	21
which	21
they	21
brought	21
to	21
be	21
passed.”	21
“That	21
may	21
be,”	21
said	21
Ricote;	21
“but	21
I	21
know	21
they	21
did	21
not	21
touch	21
my	21
hoard,	21
for	21
I	21
did	21
not	21
tell	21
them	21
where	21
it	21
was,	21
for	21
fear	21
of	21
accidents;	21
and	21
so,	21
if	21
thou	21
wilt	21
come	21
with	21
me,	21
Sancho,	21
and	21
help	21
me	21
to	21
take	21
it	21
away	21
and	21
conceal	21
it,	21
I	21
will	21
give	21
thee	21
two	21
hundred	21
crowns	21
wherewith	21
thou	21
mayest	21
relieve	21
thy	21
necessities,	21
and,	21
as	21
thou	21
knowest,	21
I	21
know	21
they	21
are	21
many.”	21
“I	21
would	21
do	21
it,”	21
said	21
Sancho;	21
“but	21
I	21
am	21
not	21
at	21
all	21
covetous,	21
for	21
I	21
gave	21
up	21
an	21
office	21
this	21
morning	21
in	21
which,	21
if	21
I	21
was,	21
I	21
might	21
have	21
made	21
the	21
walls	21
of	21
my	21
house	21
of	21
gold	21
and	21
dined	21
off	21
silver	21
plates	21
before	21
six	21
months	21
were	21
over;	21
and	21
so	21
for	21
this	21
reason,	21
and	21
because	21
I	21
feel	21
I	21
would	21
be	21
guilty	21
of	21
treason	21
to	21
my	21
king	21
if	21
I	21
helped	21
his	21
enemies,	21
I	21
would	21
not	21
go	21
with	21
thee	21
if	21
instead	21
of	21
promising	21
me	21
two	21
hundred	21
crowns	21
thou	21
wert	21
to	21
give	21
me	21
four	21
hundred	21
here	21
in	21
hand.”	21
“And	21
what	21
office	21
is	21
this	21
thou	21
hast	21
given	21
up,	21
Sancho?”	21
asked	21
Ricote.	21
“I	21
have	21
given	21
up	21
being	21
governor	21
of	21
an	21
island,”	21
said	21
Sancho,	21
“and	21
such	21
a	21
one,	21
faith,	21
as	21
you	21
won’t	21
find	21
the	21
like	21
of	21
easily.”	21
“And	21
where	21
is	21
this	21
island?”	21
said	21
Ricote.	21
“Where?”	21
said	21
Sancho;	21
“two	21
leagues	21
from	21
here,	21
and	21
it	21
is	21
called	21
the	21
island	21
of	21
Barataria.”	21
“Nonsense!	21
Sancho,”	21
said	21
Ricote;	21
“islands	21
are	21
away	21
out	21
in	21
the	21
sea;	21
there	21
are	21
no	21
islands	21
on	21
the	21
mainland.”	21
“What?	21
No	21
islands!”	21
said	21
Sancho;	21
“I	21
tell	21
thee,	21
friend	21
Ricote,	21
I	21
left	21
it	21
this	21
morning,	21
and	21
yesterday	21
I	21
was	21
governing	21
there	21
as	21
I	21
pleased	21
like	21
a	21
sagittarius;	21
but	21
for	21
all	21
that	21
I	21
gave	21
it	21
up,	21
for	21
it	21
seemed	21
to	21
me	21
a	21
dangerous	21
office,	21
a	21
governor’s.”	21
“And	21
what	21
hast	21
thou	21
gained	21
by	21
the	21
government?”	21
asked	21
Ricote.	21
“I	21
have	21
gained,”	21
said	21
Sancho,	21
“the	21
knowledge	21
that	21
I	21
am	21
no	21
good	21
for	21
governing,	21
unless	21
it	21
is	21
a	21
drove	21
of	21
cattle,	21
and	21
that	21
the	21
riches	21
that	21
are	21
to	21
be	21
got	21
by	21
these	21
governments	21
are	21
got	21
at	21
the	21
cost	21
of	21
one’s	21
rest	21
and	21
sleep,	21
ay	21
and	21
even	21
one’s	21
food;	21
for	21
in	21
islands	21
the	21
governors	21
must	21
eat	21
little,	21
especially	21
if	21
they	21
have	21
doctors	21
to	21
look	21
after	21
their	21
health.”	21
“I	21
don’t	21
understand	21
thee,	21
Sancho,”	21
said	21
Ricote;	21
“but	21
it	21
seems	21
to	21
me	21
all	21
nonsense	21
thou	21
art	21
talking.	21
Who	21
would	21
give	21
thee	21
islands	21
to	21
govern?	21
Is	21
there	21
any	21
scarcity	21
in	21
the	21
world	21
of	21
cleverer	21
men	21
than	21
thou	21
art	21
for	21
governors?	21
Hold	21
thy	21
peace,	21
Sancho,	21
and	21
come	21
back	21
to	21
thy	21
senses,	21
and	21
consider	21
whether	21
thou	21
wilt	21
come	21
with	21
me	21
as	21
I	21
said	21
to	21
help	21
me	21
to	21
take	21
away	21
treasure	21
I	21
left	21
buried	21
(for	21
indeed	21
it	21
may	21
be	21
called	21
a	21
treasure,	21
it	21
is	21
so	21
large),	21
and	21
I	21
will	21
give	21
thee	21
wherewithal	21
to	21
keep	21
thee,	21
as	21
I	21
told	21
thee.”	21
“And	21
I	21
have	21
told	21
thee	21
already,	21
Ricote,	21
that	21
I	21
will	21
not,”	21
said	21
Sancho;	21
“let	21
it	21
content	21
thee	21
that	21
by	21
me	21
thou	21
shalt	21
not	21
be	21
betrayed,	21
and	21
go	21
thy	21
way	21
in	21
God’s	21
name	21
and	21
let	21
me	21
go	21
mine;	21
for	21
I	21
know	21
that	21
well-gotten	21
gain	21
may	21
be	21
lost,	21
but	21
ill-gotten	21
gain	21
is	21
lost,	21
itself	21
and	21
its	21
owner	21
likewise.”	21
“I	21
will	21
not	21
press	21
thee,	21
Sancho,”	21
said	21
Ricote;	21
“but	21
tell	21
me,	21
wert	21
thou	21
in	21
our	21
village	21
when	21
my	21
wife	21
and	21
daughter	21
and	21
brother-in-law	21
left	21
it?”	21
“I	21
was	21
so,”	21
said	21
Sancho;	21
“and	21
I	21
can	21
tell	21
thee	21
thy	21
daughter	21
left	21
it	21
looking	21
so	21
lovely	21
that	21
all	21
the	21
village	21
turned	21
out	21
to	21
see	21
her,	21
and	21
everybody	21
said	21
she	21
was	21
the	21
fairest	21
creature	21
in	21
the	21
world.	21
She	21
wept	21
as	21
she	21
went,	21
and	21
embraced	21
all	21
her	21
friends	21
and	21
acquaintances	21
and	21
those	21
who	21
came	21
out	21
to	21
see	21
her,	21
and	21
she	21
begged	21
them	21
all	21
to	21
commend	21
her	21
to	21
God	21
and	21
Our	21
Lady	21
his	21
mother,	21
and	21
this	21
in	21
such	21
a	21
touching	21
way	21
that	21
it	21
made	21
me	21
weep	21
myself,	21
though	21
I’m	21
not	21
much	21
given	21
to	21
tears	21
commonly;	21
and,	21
faith,	21
many	21
a	21
one	21
would	21
have	21
liked	21
to	21
hide	21
her,	21
or	21
go	21
out	21
and	21
carry	21
her	21
off	21
on	21
the	21
road;	21
but	21
the	21
fear	21
of	21
going	21
against	21
the	21
king’s	21
command	21
kept	21
them	21
back.	21
The	21
one	21
who	21
showed	21
himself	21
most	21
moved	21
was	21
Don	21
Pedro	21
Gregorio,	21
the	21
rich	21
young	21
heir	21
thou	21
knowest	21
of,	21
and	21
they	21
say	21
he	21
was	21
deep	21
in	21
love	21
with	21
her;	21
and	21
since	21
she	21
left	21
he	21
has	21
not	21
been	21
seen	21
in	21
our	21
village	21
again,	21
and	21
we	21
all	21
suspect	21
he	21
has	21
gone	21
after	21
her	21
to	21
steal	21
her	21
away,	21
but	21
so	21
far	21
nothing	21
has	21
been	21
heard	21
of	21
it.”	21
“I	21
always	21
had	21
a	21
suspicion	21
that	21
gentleman	21
had	21
a	21
passion	21
for	21
my	21
daughter,”	21
said	21
Ricote;	21
“but	21
as	21
I	21
felt	21
sure	21
of	21
my	21
Ricota’s	21
virtue	21
it	21
gave	21
me	21
no	21
uneasiness	21
to	21
know	21
that	21
he	21
loved	21
her;	21
for	21
thou	21
must	21
have	21
heard	21
it	21
said,	21
Sancho,	21
that	21
the	21
Morisco	21
women	21
seldom	21
or	21
never	21
engage	21
in	21
amours	21
with	21
the	21
old	21
Christians;	21
and	21
my	21
daughter,	21
who	21
I	21
fancy	21
thought	21
more	21
of	21
being	21
a	21
Christian	21
than	21
of	21
lovemaking,	21
would	21
not	21
trouble	21
herself	21
about	21
the	21
attentions	21
of	21
this	21
heir.”	21
“God	21
grant	21
it,”	21
said	21
Sancho,	21
“for	21
it	21
would	21
be	21
a	21
bad	21
business	21
for	21
both	21
of	21
them;	21
but	21
now	21
let	21
me	21
be	21
off,	21
friend	21
Ricote,	21
for	21
I	21
want	21
to	21
reach	21
where	21
my	21
master	21
Don	21
Quixote	21
is	21
to-night.”	21
“God	21
be	21
with	21
thee,	21
brother	21
Sancho,”	21
said	21
Ricote;	21
“my	21
comrades	21
are	21
beginning	21
to	21
stir,	21
and	21
it	21
is	21
time,	21
too,	21
for	21
us	21
to	21
continue	21
our	21
journey;”	21
and	21
then	21
they	21
both	21
embraced,	21
and	21
Sancho	21
mounted	21
Dapple,	21
and	21
Ricote	21
leant	21
upon	21
his	21
staff,	21
and	21
so	21
they	21
parted.	21

The	21
length	21
of	21
time	21
he	21
delayed	21
with	21
Ricote	21
prevented	21
Sancho	21
from	21
reaching	21
the	21
duke’s	21
castle	21
that	21
day,	21
though	21
he	21
was	21
within	21
half	21
a	21
league	21
of	21
it	21
when	21
night,	21
somewhat	21
dark	21
and	21
cloudy,	21
overtook	21
him.	21
This,	21
however,	21
as	21
it	21
was	21
summer	21
time,	21
did	21
not	21
give	21
him	21
much	21
uneasiness,	21
and	21
he	21
turned	21
aside	21
out	21
of	21
the	21
road	21
intending	21
to	21
wait	21
for	21
morning;	21
but	21
his	21
ill	21
luck	21
and	21
hard	21
fate	21
so	21
willed	21
it	21
that	21
as	21
he	21
was	21
searching	21
about	21
for	21
a	21
place	21
to	21
make	21
himself	21
as	21
comfortable	21
as	21
possible,	21
he	21
and	21
Dapple	21
fell	21
into	21
a	21
deep	21
dark	21
hole	21
that	21
lay	21
among	21
some	21
very	21
old	21
buildings.	21
As	21
he	21
fell	21
he	21
commended	21
himself	21
with	21
all	21
his	21
heart	21
to	21
God,	21
fancying	21
he	21
was	21
not	21
going	21
to	21
stop	21
until	21
he	21
reached	21
the	21
depths	21
of	21
the	21
bottomless	21
pit;	21
but	21
it	21
did	21
not	21
turn	21
out	21
so,	21
for	21
at	21
little	21
more	21
than	21
thrice	21
a	21
man’s	21
height	21
Dapple	21
touched	21
bottom,	21
and	21
he	21
found	21
himself	21
sitting	21
on	21
him	21
without	21
having	21
received	21
any	21
hurt	21
or	21
damage	21
whatever.	21
He	21
felt	21
himself	21
all	21
over	21
and	21
held	21
his	21
breath	21
to	21
try	21
whether	21
he	21
was	21
quite	21
sound	21
or	21
had	21
a	21
hole	21
made	21
in	21
him	21
anywhere,	21
and	21
finding	21
himself	21
all	21
right	21
and	21
whole	21
and	21
in	21
perfect	21
health	21
he	21
was	21
profuse	21
in	21
his	21
thanks	21
to	21
God	21
our	21
Lord	21
for	21
the	21
mercy	21
that	21
had	21
been	21
shown	21
him,	21
for	21
he	21
made	21
sure	21
he	21
had	21
been	21
broken	21
into	21
a	21
thousand	21
pieces.	21
He	21
also	21
felt	21
along	21
the	21
sides	21
of	21
the	21
pit	21
with	21
his	21
hands	21
to	21
see	21
if	21
it	21
were	21
possible	21
to	21
get	21
out	21
of	21
it	21
without	21
help,	21
but	21
he	21
found	21
they	21
were	21
quite	21
smooth	21
and	21
afforded	21
no	21
hold	21
anywhere,	21
at	21
which	21
he	21
was	21
greatly	21
distressed,	21
especially	21
when	21
he	21
heard	21
how	21
pathetically	21
and	21
dolefully	21
Dapple	21
was	21
bemoaning	21
himself,	21
and	21
no	21
wonder	21
he	21
complained,	21
nor	21
was	21
it	21
from	21
ill-temper,	21
for	21
in	21
truth	21
he	21
was	21
not	21
in	21
a	21
very	21
good	21
case.	21
“Alas,”	21
said	21
Sancho,	21
“what	21
unexpected	21
accidents	21
happen	21
at	21
every	21
step	21
to	21
those	21
who	21
live	21
in	21
this	21
miserable	21
world!	21
Who	21
would	21
have	21
said	21
that	21
one	21
who	21
saw	21
himself	21
yesterday	21
sitting	21
on	21
a	21
throne,	21
governor	21
of	21
an	21
island,	21
giving	21
orders	21
to	21
his	21
servants	21
and	21
his	21
vassals,	21
would	21
see	21
himself	21
to-day	21
buried	21
in	21
a	21
pit	21
without	21
a	21
soul	21
to	21
help	21
him,	21
or	21
servant	21
or	21
vassal	21
to	21
come	21
to	21
his	21
relief?	21
Here	21
must	21
we	21
perish	21
with	21
hunger,	21
my	21
ass	21
and	21
myself,	21
if	21
indeed	21
we	21
don’t	21
die	21
first,	21
he	21
of	21
his	21
bruises	21
and	21
injuries,	21
and	21
I	21
of	21
grief	21
and	21
sorrow.	21
At	21
any	21
rate	21
I’ll	21
not	21
be	21
as	21
lucky	21
as	21
my	21
master	21
Don	21
Quixote	21
of	21
La	21
Mancha,	21
when	21
he	21
went	21
down	21
into	21
the	21
cave	21
of	21
that	21
enchanted	21
Montesinos,	21
where	21
he	21
found	21
people	21
to	21
make	21
more	21
of	21
him	21
than	21
if	21
he	21
had	21
been	21
in	21
his	21
own	21
house;	21
for	21
it	21
seems	21
he	21
came	21
in	21
for	21
a	21
table	21
laid	21
out	21
and	21
a	21
bed	21
ready	21
made.	21
There	21
he	21
saw	21
fair	21
and	21
pleasant	21
visions,	21
but	21
here	21
I’ll	21
see,	21
I	21
imagine,	21
toads	21
and	21
adders.	21
Unlucky	21
wretch	21
that	21
I	21
am,	21
what	21
an	21
end	21
my	21
follies	21
and	21
fancies	21
have	21
come	21
to!	21
They’ll	21
take	21
up	21
my	21
bones	21
out	21
of	21
this,	21
when	21
it	21
is	21
heaven’s	21
will	21
that	21
I’m	21
found,	21
picked	21
clean,	21
white	21
and	21
polished,	21
and	21
my	21
good	21
Dapple’s	21
with	21
them,	21
and	21
by	21
that,	21
perhaps,	21
it	21
will	21
be	21
found	21
out	21
who	21
we	21
are,	21
at	21
least	21
by	21
such	21
as	21
have	21
heard	21
that	21
Sancho	21
Panza	21
never	21
separated	21
from	21
his	21
ass,	21
nor	21
his	21
ass	21
from	21
Sancho	21
Panza.	21
Unlucky	21
wretches,	21
I	21
say	21
again,	21
that	21
our	21
hard	21
fate	21
should	21
not	21
let	21
us	21
die	21
in	21
our	21
own	21
country	21
and	21
among	21
our	21
own	21
people,	21
where	21
if	21
there	21
was	21
no	21
help	21
for	21
our	21
misfortune,	21
at	21
any	21
rate	21
there	21
would	21
be	21
someone	21
to	21
grieve	21
for	21
it	21
and	21
to	21
close	21
our	21
eyes	21
as	21
we	21
passed	21
away!	21
O	21
comrade	21
and	21
friend,	21
how	21
ill	21
have	21
I	21
repaid	21
thy	21
faithful	21
services!	21
Forgive	21
me,	21
and	21
entreat	21
Fortune,	21
as	21
well	21
as	21
thou	21
canst,	21
to	21
deliver	21
us	21
out	21
of	21
this	21
miserable	21
strait	21
we	21
are	21
both	21
in;	21
and	21
I	21
promise	21
to	21
put	21
a	21
crown	21
of	21
laurel	21
on	21
thy	21
head,	21
and	21
make	21
thee	21
look	21
like	21
a	21
poet	21
laureate,	21
and	21
give	21
thee	21
double	21
feeds.”	21

In	21
this	21
strain	21
did	21
Sancho	21
bewail	21
himself,	21
and	21
his	21
ass	21
listened	21
to	21
him,	21
but	21
answered	21
him	21
never	21
a	21
word,	21
such	21
was	21
the	21
distress	21
and	21
anguish	21
the	21
poor	21
beast	21
found	21
himself	21
in.	21
At	21
length,	21
after	21
a	21
night	21
spent	21
in	21
bitter	21
moanings	21
and	21
lamentations,	21
day	21
came,	21
and	21
by	21
its	21
light	21
Sancho	21
perceived	21
that	21
it	21
was	21
wholly	21
impossible	21
to	21
escape	21
out	21
of	21
that	21
pit	21
without	21
help,	21
and	21
he	21
fell	21
to	21
bemoaning	21
his	21
fate	21
and	21
uttering	21
loud	21
shouts	21
to	21
find	21
out	21
if	21
there	21
was	21
anyone	21
within	21
hearing;	21
but	21
all	21
his	21
shouting	21
was	21
only	21
crying	21
in	21
the	21
wilderness,	21
for	21
there	21
was	21
not	21
a	21
soul	21
anywhere	21
in	21
the	21
neighbourhood	21
to	21
hear	21
him,	21
and	21
then	21
at	21
last	21
he	21
gave	21
himself	21
up	21
for	21
dead.	21
Dapple	21
was	21
lying	21
on	21
his	21
back,	21
and	21
Sancho	21
helped	21
him	21
to	21
his	21
feet,	21
which	21
he	21
was	21
scarcely	21
able	21
to	21
keep;	21
and	21
then	21
taking	21
a	21
piece	21
of	21
bread	21
out	21
of	21
his	21
alforjas	21
which	21
had	21
shared	21
their	21
fortunes	21
in	21
the	21
fall,	21
he	21
gave	21
it	21
to	21
the	21
ass,	21
to	21
whom	21
it	21
was	21
not	21
unwelcome,	21
saying	21
to	21
him	21
as	21
if	21
he	21
understood	21
him,	21
“With	21
bread	21
all	21
sorrows	21
are	21
less.”	21
And	21
now	21
he	21
perceived	21
on	21
one	21
side	21
of	21
the	21
pit	21
a	21
hole	21
large	21
enough	21
to	21
admit	21
a	21
person	21
if	21
he	21
stooped	21
and	21
squeezed	21
himself	21
into	21
a	21
small	21
compass.	21
Sancho	21
made	21
for	21
it,	21
and	21
entered	21
it	21
by	21
creeping,	21
and	21
found	21
it	21
wide	21
and	21
spacious	21
on	21
the	21
inside,	21
which	21
he	21
was	21
able	21
to	21
see	21
as	21
a	21
ray	21
of	21
sunlight	21
that	21
penetrated	21
what	21
might	21
be	21
called	21
the	21
roof	21
showed	21
it	21
all	21
plainly.	21
He	21
observed	21
too	21
that	21
it	21
opened	21
and	21
widened	21
out	21
into	21
another	21
spacious	21
cavity;	21
seeing	21
which	21
he	21
made	21
his	21
way	21
back	21
to	21
where	21
the	21
ass	21
was,	21
and	21
with	21
a	21
stone	21
began	21
to	21
pick	21
away	21
the	21
clay	21
from	21
the	21
hole	21
until	21
in	21
a	21
short	21
time	21
he	21
had	21
made	21
room	21
for	21
the	21
beast	21
to	21
pass	21
easily,	21
and	21
this	21
accomplished,	21
taking	21
him	21
by	21
the	21
halter,	21
he	21
proceeded	21
to	21
traverse	21
the	21
cavern	21
to	21
see	21
if	21
there	21
was	21
any	21
outlet	21
at	21
the	21
other	21
end.	21
He	21
advanced,	21
sometimes	21
in	21
the	21
dark,	21
sometimes	21
without	21
light,	21
but	21
never	21
without	21
fear;	21
“God	21
Almighty	21
help	21
me!”	21
said	21
he	21
to	21
himself;	21
“this	21
that	21
is	21
a	21
misadventure	21
to	21
me	21
would	21
make	21
a	21
good	21
adventure	21
for	21
my	21
master	21
Don	21
Quixote.	21
He	21
would	21
have	21
been	21
sure	21
to	21
take	21
these	21
depths	21
and	21
dungeons	21
for	21
flowery	21
gardens	21
or	21
the	21
palaces	21
of	21
Galiana,	21
and	21
would	21
have	21
counted	21
upon	21
issuing	21
out	21
of	21
this	21
darkness	21
and	21
imprisonment	21
into	21
some	21
blooming	21
meadow;	21
but	21
I,	21
unlucky	21
that	21
I	21
am,	21
hopeless	21
and	21
spiritless,	21
expect	21
at	21
every	21
step	21
another	21
pit	21
deeper	21
than	21
the	21
first	21
to	21
open	21
under	21
my	21
feet	21
and	21
swallow	21
me	21
up	21
for	21
good;	21
‘welcome	21
evil,	21
if	21
thou	21
comest	21
alone.’”	21
In	21
this	21
way	21
and	21
with	21
these	21
reflections	21
he	21
seemed	21
to	21
himself	21
to	21
have	21
travelled	21
rather	21
more	21
than	21
half	21
a	21
league,	21
when	21
at	21
last	21
he	21
perceived	21
a	21
dim	21
light	21
that	21
looked	21
like	21
daylight	21
and	21
found	21
its	21
way	21
in	21
on	21
one	21
side,	21
showing	21
that	21
this	21
road,	21
which	21
appeared	21
to	21
him	21
the	21
road	21
to	21
the	21
other	21
world,	21
led	21
to	21
some	21
opening.	21
Here	21
Cide	21
Hamete	21
leaves	21
him,	21
and	21
returns	21
to	21
Don	21
Quixote,	21
who	21
in	21
high	21
spirits	21
and	21
satisfaction	21
was	21
looking	21
forward	21
to	21
the	21
day	21
fixed	21
for	21
the	21
battle	21
he	21
was	21
to	21
fight	21
with	21
him	21
who	21
had	21
robbed	21
Doña	21
Rodriguez’s	21
daughter	21
of	21
her	21
honour,	21
for	21
whom	21
he	21
hoped	21
to	21
obtain	21
satisfaction	21
for	21
the	21
wrong	21
and	21
injury	21
shamefully	21
done	21
to	21
her.	21
It	21
came	21
to	21
pass,	21
then,	21
that	21
having	21
sallied	21
forth	21
one	21
morning	21
to	21
practise	21
and	21
exercise	21
himself	21
in	21
what	21
he	21
would	21
have	21
to	21
do	21
in	21
the	21
encounter	21
he	21
expected	21
to	21
find	21
himself	21
engaged	21
in	21
the	21
next	21
day,	21
as	21
he	21
was	21
putting	21
Rocinante	21
through	21
his	21
paces	21
or	21
pressing	21
him	21
to	21
the	21
charge,	21
he	21
brought	21
his	21
feet	21
so	21
close	21
to	21
a	21
pit	21
that	21
but	21
for	21
reining	21
him	21
in	21
tightly	21
it	21
would	21
have	21
been	21
impossible	21
for	21
him	21
to	21
avoid	21
falling	21
into	21
it.	21
He	21
pulled	21
him	21
up,	21
however,	21
without	21
a	21
fall,	21
and	21
coming	21
a	21
little	21
closer	21
examined	21
the	21
hole	21
without	21
dismounting;	21
but	21
as	21
he	21
was	21
looking	21
at	21
it	21
he	21
heard	21
loud	21
cries	21
proceeding	21
from	21
it,	21
and	21
by	21
listening	21
attentively	21
was	21
able	21
to	21
make	21
out	21
that	21
he	21
who	21
uttered	21
them	21
was	21
saying,	21
“Ho,	21
above	21
there!	21
is	21
there	21
any	21
Christian	21
that	21
hears	21
me,	21
or	21
any	21
charitable	21
gentleman	21
that	21
will	21
take	21
pity	21
on	21
a	21
sinner	21
buried	21
alive,	21
on	21
an	21
unfortunate	21
disgoverned	21
governor?”	21
It	21
struck	21
Don	21
Quixote	21
that	21
it	21
was	21
the	21
voice	21
of	21
Sancho	21
Panza	21
he	21
heard,	21
whereat	21
he	21
was	21
taken	21
aback	21
and	21
amazed,	21
and	21
raising	21
his	21
own	21
voice	21
as	21
much	21
as	21
he	21
could,	21
he	21
cried	21
out,	21
“Who	21
is	21
below	21
there?	21
Who	21
is	21
that	21
complaining?”	21
“Who	21
should	21
be	21
here,	21
or	21
who	21
should	21
complain,”	21
was	21
the	21
answer,	21
“but	21
the	21
forlorn	21
Sancho	21
Panza,	21
for	21
his	21
sins	21
and	21
for	21
his	21
ill-luck	21
governor	21
of	21
the	21
island	21
of	21
Barataria,	21
squire	21
that	21
was	21
to	21
the	21
famous	21
knight	21
Don	21
Quixote	21
of	21
La	21
Mancha?”	21
When	21
Don	21
Quixote	21
heard	21
this	21
his	21
amazement	21
was	21
redoubled	21
and	21
his	21
perturbation	21
grew	21
greater	21
than	21
ever,	21
for	21
it	21
suggested	21
itself	21
to	21
his	21
mind	21
that	21
Sancho	21
must	21
be	21
dead,	21
and	21
that	21
his	21
soul	21
was	21
in	21
torment	21
down	21
there;	21
and	21
carried	21
away	21
by	21
this	21
idea	21
he	21
exclaimed,	21
“I	21
conjure	21
thee	21
by	21
everything	21
that	21
as	21
a	21
Catholic	21
Christian	21
I	21
can	21
conjure	21
thee	21
by,	21
tell	21
me	21
who	21
thou	21
art;	21
and	21
if	21
thou	21
art	21
a	21
soul	21
in	21
torment,	21
tell	21
me	21
what	21
thou	21
wouldst	21
have	21
me	21
do	21
for	21
thee;	21
for	21
as	21
my	21
profession	21
is	21
to	21
give	21
aid	21
and	21
succour	21
to	21
those	21
that	21
need	21
it	21
in	21
this	21
world,	21
it	21
will	21
also	21
extend	21
to	21
aiding	21
and	21
succouring	21
the	21
distressed	21
of	21
the	21
other,	21
who	21
cannot	21
help	21
themselves.”	21
“In	21
that	21
case,”	21
answered	21
the	21
voice,	21
“your	21
worship	21
who	21
speaks	21
to	21
me	21
must	21
be	21
my	21
master	21
Don	21
Quixote	21
of	21
La	21
Mancha;	21
nay,	21
from	21
the	21
tone	21
of	21
the	21
voice	21
it	21
is	21
plain	21
it	21
can	21
be	21
nobody	21
else.”	21
“Don	21
Quixote	21
I	21
am,”	21
replied	21
Don	21
Quixote,	21
“he	21
whose	21
profession	21
it	21
is	21
to	21
aid	21
and	21
succour	21
the	21
living	21
and	21
the	21
dead	21
in	21
their	21
necessities;	21
wherefore	21
tell	21
me	21
who	21
thou	21
art,	21
for	21
thou	21
art	21
keeping	21
me	21
in	21
suspense;	21
because,	21
if	21
thou	21
art	21
my	21
squire	21
Sancho	21
Panza,	21
and	21
art	21
dead,	21
since	21
the	21
devils	21
have	21
not	21
carried	21
thee	21
off,	21
and	21
thou	21
art	21
by	21
God’s	21
mercy	21
in	21
purgatory,	21
our	21
holy	21
mother	21
the	21
Roman	21
Catholic	21
Church	21
has	21
intercessory	21
means	21
sufficient	21
to	21
release	21
thee	21
from	21
the	21
pains	21
thou	21
art	21
in;	21
and	21
I	21
for	21
my	21
part	21
will	21
plead	21
with	21
her	21
to	21
that	21
end,	21
so	21
far	21
as	21
my	21
substance	21
will	21
go;	21
without	21
further	21
delay,	21
therefore,	21
declare	21
thyself,	21
and	21
tell	21
me	21
who	21
thou	21
art.”	21
“By	21
all	21
that’s	21
good,”	21
was	21
the	21
answer,	21
“and	21
by	21
the	21
birth	21
of	21
whomsoever	21
your	21
worship	21
chooses,	21
I	21
swear,	21
Señor	21
Don	21
Quixote	21
of	21
La	21
Mancha,	21
that	21
I	21
am	21
your	21
squire	21
Sancho	21
Panza,	21
and	21
that	21
I	21
have	21
never	21
died	21
all	21
my	21
life;	21
but	21
that,	21
having	21
given	21
up	21
my	21
government	21
for	21
reasons	21
that	21
would	21
require	21
more	21
time	21
to	21
explain,	21
I	21
fell	21
last	21
night	21
into	21
this	21
pit	21
where	21
I	21
am	21
now,	21
and	21
Dapple	21
is	21
witness	21
and	21
won’t	21
let	21
me	21
lie,	21
for	21
more	21
by	21
token	21
he	21
is	21
here	21
with	21
me.”	21
Nor	21
was	21
this	21
all;	21
one	21
would	21
have	21
fancied	21
the	21
ass	21
understood	21
what	21
Sancho	21
said,	21
because	21
that	21
moment	21
he	21
began	21
to	21
bray	21
so	21
loudly	21
that	21
the	21
whole	21
cave	21
rang	21
again.	21
“Famous	21
testimony!”	21
exclaimed	21
Don	21
Quixote;	21
“I	21
know	21
that	21
bray	21
as	21
well	21
as	21
if	21
I	21
was	21
its	21
mother,	21
and	21
thy	21
voice	21
too,	21
my	21
Sancho.	21
Wait	21
while	21
I	21
go	21
to	21
the	21
duke’s	21
castle,	21
which	21
is	21
close	21
by,	21
and	21
I	21
will	21
bring	21
someone	21
to	21
take	21
thee	21
out	21
of	21
this	21
pit	21
into	21
which	21
thy	21
sins	21
no	21
doubt	21
have	21
brought	21
thee.”	21
“Go,	21
your	21
worship,”	21
said	21
Sancho,	21
“and	21
come	21
back	21
quick	21
for	21
God’s	21
sake;	21
for	21
I	21
cannot	21
bear	21
being	21
buried	21
alive	21
any	21
longer,	21
and	21
I’m	21
dying	21
of	21
fear.”	21
Don	21
Quixote	21
left	21
him,	21
and	21
hastened	21
to	21
the	21
castle	21
to	21
tell	21
the	21
duke	21
and	21
duchess	21
what	21
had	21
happened	21
Sancho,	21
and	21
they	21
were	21
not	21
a	21
little	21
astonished	21
at	21
it;	21
they	21
could	21
easily	21
understand	21
his	21
having	21
fallen,	21
from	21
the	21
confirmatory	21
circumstance	21
of	21
the	21
cave	21
which	21
had	21
been	21
in	21
existence	21
there	21
from	21
time	21
immemorial;	21
but	21
they	21
could	21
not	21
imagine	21
how	21
he	21
had	21
quitted	21
the	21
government	21
without	21
their	21
receiving	21
any	21
intimation	21
of	21
his	21
coming.	21
To	21
be	21
brief,	21
they	21
fetched	21
ropes	21
and	21
tackle,	21
as	21
the	21
saying	21
is,	21
and	21
by	21
dint	21
of	21
many	21
hands	21
and	21
much	21
labour	21
they	21
drew	21
up	21
Dapple	21
and	21
Sancho	21
Panza	21
out	21
of	21
the	21
darkness	21
into	21
the	21
light	21
of	21
day.	21
A	21
student	21
who	21
saw	21
him	21
remarked,	21
“That’s	21
the	21
way	21
all	21
bad	21
governors	21
should	21
come	21
out	21
of	21
their	21
governments,	21
as	21
this	21
sinner	21
comes	21
out	21
of	21
the	21
depths	21
of	21
the	21
pit,	21
dead	21
with	21
hunger,	21
pale,	21
and	21
I	21
suppose	21
without	21
a	21
farthing.”	21
Sancho	21
overheard	21
him	21
and	21
said,	21
“It	21
is	21
eight	21
or	21
ten	21
days,	21
brother	21
growler,	21
since	21
I	21
entered	21
upon	21
the	21
government	21
of	21
the	21
island	21
they	21
gave	21
me,	21
and	21
all	21
that	21
time	21
I	21
never	21
had	21
a	21
bellyful	21
of	21
victuals,	21
no	21
not	21
for	21
an	21
hour;	21
doctors	21
persecuted	21
me	21
and	21
enemies	21
crushed	21
my	21
bones;	21
nor	21
had	21
I	21
any	21
opportunity	21
of	21
taking	21
bribes	21
or	21
levying	21
taxes;	21
and	21
if	21
that	21
be	21
the	21
case,	21
as	21
it	21
is,	21
I	21
don’t	21
deserve,	21
I	21
think,	21
to	21
come	21
out	21
in	21
this	21
fashion;	21
but	21
‘man	21
proposes	21
and	21
God	21
disposes;’	21
and	21
God	21
knows	21
what	21
is	21
best,	21
and	21
what	21
suits	21
each	21
one	21
best;	21
and	21
‘as	21
the	21
occasion,	21
so	21
the	21
behaviour;’	21
and	21
‘let	21
nobody	21
say	21
“I	21
won’t	21
drink	21
of	21
this	21
water;”’	21
and	21
‘where	21
one	21
thinks	21
there	21
are	21
flitches,	21
there	21
are	21
no	21
pegs;’	21
God	21
knows	21
my	21
meaning	21
and	21
that’s	21
enough;	21
I	21
say	21
no	21
more,	21
though	21
I	21
could.”	21
“Be	21
not	21
angry	21
or	21
annoyed	21
at	21
what	21
thou	21
hearest,	21
Sancho,”	21
said	21
Don	21
Quixote,	21
“or	21
there	21
will	21
never	21
be	21
an	21
end	21
of	21
it;	21
keep	21
a	21
safe	21
conscience	21
and	21
let	21
them	21
say	21
what	21
they	21
like;	21
for	21
trying	21
to	21
stop	21
slanderers’	21
tongues	21
is	21
like	21
trying	21
to	21
put	21
gates	21
to	21
the	21
open	21
plain.	21
If	21
a	21
governor	21
comes	21
out	21
of	21
his	21
government	21
rich,	21
they	21
say	21
he	21
has	21
been	21
a	21
thief;	21
and	21
if	21
he	21
comes	21
out	21
poor,	21
that	21
he	21
has	21
been	21
a	21
noodle	21
and	21
a	21
blockhead.”	21
“They’ll	21
be	21
pretty	21
sure	21
this	21
time,”	21
said	21
Sancho,	21
“to	21
set	21
me	21
down	21
for	21
a	21
fool	21
rather	21
than	21
a	21
thief.”	21
Thus	21
talking,	21
and	21
surrounded	21
by	21
boys	21
and	21
a	21
crowd	21
of	21
people,	21
they	21
reached	21
the	21
castle,	21
where	21
in	21
one	21
of	21
the	21
corridors	21
the	21
duke	21
and	21
duchess	21
stood	21
waiting	21
for	21
them;	21
but	21
Sancho	21
would	21
not	21
go	21
up	21
to	21
see	21
the	21
duke	21
until	21
he	21
had	21
first	21
put	21
up	21
Dapple	21
in	21
the	21
stable,	21
for	21
he	21
said	21
he	21
had	21
passed	21
a	21
very	21
bad	21
night	21
in	21
his	21
last	21
quarters;	21
then	21
he	21
went	21
upstairs	21
to	21
see	21
his	21
lord	21
and	21
lady,	21
and	21
kneeling	21
before	21
them	21
he	21
said,	21
“Because	21
it	21
was	21
your	21
highnesses’	21
pleasure,	21
not	21
because	21
of	21
any	21
desert	21
of	21
my	21
own,	21
I	21
went	21
to	21
govern	21
your	21
island	21
of	21
Barataria,	21
which	21
‘I	21
entered	21
naked,	21
and	21
naked	21
I	21
find	21
myself;	21
I	21
neither	21
lose	21
nor	21
gain.’	21
Whether	21
I	21
have	21
governed	21
well	21
or	21
ill,	21
I	21
have	21
had	21
witnesses	21
who	21
will	21
say	21
what	21
they	21
think	21
fit.	21
I	21
have	21
answered	21
questions,	21
I	21
have	21
decided	21
causes,	21
and	21
always	21
dying	21
of	21
hunger,	21
for	21
Doctor	21
Pedro	21
Recio	21
of	21
Tirteafuera,	21
the	21
island	21
and	21
governor	21
doctor,	21
would	21
have	21
it	21
so.	21
Enemies	21
attacked	21
us	21
by	21
night	21
and	21
put	21
us	21
in	21
a	21
great	21
quandary,	21
but	21
the	21
people	21
of	21
the	21
island	21
say	21
they	21
came	21
off	21
safe	21
and	21
victorious	21
by	21
the	21
might	21
of	21
my	21
arm;	21
and	21
may	21
God	21
give	21
them	21
as	21
much	21
health	21
as	21
there’s	21
truth	21
in	21
what	21
they	21
say.	21
In	21
short,	21
during	21
that	21
time	21
I	21
have	21
weighed	21
the	21
cares	21
and	21
responsibilities	21
governing	21
brings	21
with	21
it,	21
and	21
by	21
my	21
reckoning	21
I	21
find	21
my	21
shoulders	21
can’t	21
bear	21
them,	21
nor	21
are	21
they	21
a	21
load	21
for	21
my	21
loins	21
or	21
arrows	21
for	21
my	21
quiver;	21
and	21
so,	21
before	21
the	21
government	21
threw	21
me	21
over	21
I	21
preferred	21
to	21
throw	21
the	21
government	21
over;	21
and	21
yesterday	21
morning	21
I	21
left	21
the	21
island	21
as	21
I	21
found	21
it,	21
with	21
the	21
same	21
streets,	21
houses,	21
and	21
roofs	21
it	21
had	21
when	21
I	21
entered	21
it.	21
I	21
asked	21
no	21
loan	21
of	21
anybody,	21
nor	21
did	21
I	21
try	21
to	21
fill	21
my	21
pocket;	21
and	21
though	21
I	21
meant	21
to	21
make	21
some	21
useful	21
laws,	21
I	21
made	21
hardly	21
any,	21
as	21
I	21
was	21
afraid	21
they	21
would	21
not	21
be	21
kept;	21
for	21
in	21
that	21
case	21
it	21
comes	21
to	21
the	21
same	21
thing	21
to	21
make	21
them	21
or	21
not	21
to	21
make	21
them.	21
I	21
quitted	21
the	21
island,	21
as	21
I	21
said,	21
without	21
any	21
escort	21
except	21
my	21
ass;	21
I	21
fell	21
into	21
a	21
pit,	21
I	21
pushed	21
on	21
through	21
it,	21
until	21
this	21
morning	21
by	21
the	21
light	21
of	21
the	21
sun	21
I	21
saw	21
an	21
outlet,	21
but	21
not	21
so	21
easy	21
a	21
one	21
but	21
that,	21
had	21
not	21
heaven	21
sent	21
me	21
my	21
master	21
Don	21
Quixote,	21
I’d	21
have	21
stayed	21
there	21
till	21
the	21
end	21
of	21
the	21
world.	21
So	21
now	21
my	21
lord	21
and	21
lady	21
duke	21
and	21
duchess,	21
here	21
is	21
your	21
governor	21
Sancho	21
Panza,	21
who	21
in	21
the	21
bare	21
ten	21
days	21
he	21
has	21
held	21
the	21
government	21
has	21
come	21
by	21
the	21
knowledge	21
that	21
he	21
would	21
not	21
give	21
anything	21
to	21
be	21
governor,	21
not	21
to	21
say	21
of	21
an	21
island,	21
but	21
of	21
the	21
whole	21
world;	21
and	21
that	21
point	21
being	21
settled,	21
kissing	21
your	21
worships’	21
feet,	21
and	21
imitating	21
the	21
game	21
of	21
the	21
boys	21
when	21
they	21
say,	21
‘leap	21
thou,	21
and	21
give	21
me	21
one,’	21
I	21
take	21
a	21
leap	21
out	21
of	21
the	21
government	21
and	21
pass	21
into	21
the	21
service	21
of	21
my	21
master	21
Don	21
Quixote;	21
for	21
after	21
all,	21
though	21
in	21
it	21
I	21
eat	21
my	21
bread	21
in	21
fear	21
and	21
trembling,	21
at	21
any	21
rate	21
I	21
take	21
my	21
fill;	21
and	21
for	21
my	21
part,	21
so	21
long	21
as	21
I’m	21
full,	21
it’s	21
all	21
alike	21
to	21
me	21
whether	21
it’s	21
with	21
carrots	21
or	21
with	21
partridges.”	21
Here	21
Sancho	21
brought	21
his	21
long	21
speech	21
to	21
an	21
end,	21
Don	21
Quixote	21
having	21
been	21
the	21
whole	21
time	21
in	21
dread	21
of	21
his	21
uttering	21
a	21
host	21
of	21
absurdities;	21
and	21
when	21
he	21
found	21
him	21
leave	21
off	21
with	21
so	21
few,	21
he	21
thanked	21
heaven	21
in	21
his	21
heart.	21
The	21
duke	21
embraced	21
Sancho	21
and	21
told	21
him	21
he	21
was	21
heartily	21
sorry	21
he	21
had	21
given	21
up	21
the	21
government	21
so	21
soon,	21
but	21
that	21
he	21
would	21
see	21
that	21
he	21
was	21
provided	21
with	21
some	21
other	21
post	21
on	21
his	21
estate	21
less	21
onerous	21
and	21
more	21
profitable.	21
The	21
duchess	21
also	21
embraced	21
him,	21
and	21
gave	21
orders	21
that	21
he	21
should	21
be	21
taken	21
good	21
care	21
of,	21
as	21
it	21
was	21
plain	21
to	21
see	21
he	21
had	21
been	21
badly	21
treated	21
and	21
worse	21
bruised.	21

The	21
duke	21
and	21
duchess	21
had	21
no	21
reason	21
to	21
regret	21
the	21
joke	21
that	21
had	21
been	21
played	21
upon	21
Sancho	21
Panza	21
in	21
giving	21
him	21
the	21
government;	21
especially	21
as	21
their	21
majordomo	21
returned	21
the	21
same	21
day,	21
and	21
gave	21
them	21
a	21
minute	21
account	21
of	21
almost	21
every	21
word	21
and	21
deed	21
that	21
Sancho	21
uttered	21
or	21
did	21
during	21
the	21
time;	21
and	21
to	21
wind	21
up	21
with,	21
eloquently	21
described	21
to	21
them	21
the	21
attack	21
upon	21
the	21
island	21
and	21
Sancho’s	21
fright	21
and	21
departure,	21
with	21
which	21
they	21
were	21
not	21
a	21
little	21
amused.	21
After	21
this	21
the	21
history	21
goes	21
on	21
to	21
say	21
that	21
the	21
day	21
fixed	21
for	21
the	21
battle	21
arrived,	21
and	21
that	21
the	21
duke,	21
after	21
having	21
repeatedly	21
instructed	21
his	21
lacquey	21
Tosilos	21
how	21
to	21
deal	21
with	21
Don	21
Quixote	21
so	21
as	21
to	21
vanquish	21
him	21
without	21
killing	21
or	21
wounding	21
him,	21
gave	21
orders	21
to	21
have	21
the	21
heads	21
removed	21
from	21
the	21
lances,	21
telling	21
Don	21
Quixote	21
that	21
Christian	21
charity,	21
on	21
which	21
he	21
plumed	21
himself,	21
could	21
not	21
suffer	21
the	21
battle	21
to	21
be	21
fought	21
with	21
so	21
much	21
risk	21
and	21
danger	21
to	21
life;	21
and	21
that	21
he	21
must	21
be	21
content	21
with	21
the	21
offer	21
of	21
a	21
battlefield	21
on	21
his	21
territory	21
(though	21
that	21
was	21
against	21
the	21
decree	21
of	21
the	21
holy	21
Council,	21
which	21
prohibits	21
all	21
challenges	21
of	21
the	21
sort)	21
and	21
not	21
push	21
such	21
an	21
arduous	21
venture	21
to	21
its	21
extreme	21
limits.	21
Don	21
Quixote	21
bade	21
his	21
excellence	21
arrange	21
all	21
matters	21
connected	21
with	21
the	21
affair	21
as	21
he	21
pleased,	21
as	21
on	21
his	21
part	21
he	21
would	21
obey	21
him	21
in	21
everything.	21
The	21
dread	21
day,	21
then,	21
having	21
arrived,	21
and	21
the	21
duke	21
having	21
ordered	21
a	21
spacious	21
stand	21
to	21
be	21
erected	21
facing	21
the	21
court	21
of	21
the	21
castle	21
for	21
the	21
judges	21
of	21
the	21
field	21
and	21
the	21
appellant	21
duennas,	21
mother	21
and	21
daughter,	21
vast	21
crowds	21
flocked	21
from	21
all	21
the	21
villages	21
and	21
hamlets	21
of	21
the	21
neighbourhood	21
to	21
see	21
the	21
novel	21
spectacle	21
of	21
the	21
battle;	21
nobody,	21
dead	21
or	21
alive,	21
in	21
those	21
parts	21
having	21
ever	21
seen	21
or	21
heard	21
of	21
such	21
a	21
one.	21
The	21
first	21
person	21
to	21
enter	21
the	21
field	21
and	21
the	21
lists	21
was	21
the	21
master	21
of	21
the	21
ceremonies,	21
who	21
surveyed	21
and	21
paced	21
the	21
whole	21
ground	21
to	21
see	21
that	21
there	21
was	21
nothing	21
unfair	21
and	21
nothing	21
concealed	21
to	21
make	21
the	21
combatants	21
stumble	21
or	21
fall;	21
then	21
the	21
duennas	21
entered	21
and	21
seated	21
themselves,	21
enveloped	21
in	21
mantles	21
covering	21
their	21
eyes,	21
nay	21
even	21
their	21
bosoms,	21
and	21
displaying	21
no	21
slight	21
emotion	21
as	21
Don	21
Quixote	21
appeared	21
in	21
the	21
lists.	21
Shortly	21
afterwards,	21
accompanied	21
by	21
several	21
trumpets	21
and	21
mounted	21
on	21
a	21
powerful	21
steed	21
that	21
threatened	21
to	21
crush	21
the	21
whole	21
place,	21
the	21
great	21
lacquey	21
Tosilos	21
made	21
his	21
appearance	21
on	21
one	21
side	21
of	21
the	21
courtyard	21
with	21
his	21
visor	21
down	21
and	21
stiffly	21
cased	21
in	21
a	21
suit	21
of	21
stout	21
shining	21
armour.	21
The	21
horse	21
was	21
a	21
manifest	21
Frieslander,	21
broad-backed	21
and	21
flea-bitten,	21
and	21
with	21
half	21
a	21
hundred	21
of	21
wool	21
hanging	21
to	21
each	21
of	21
his	21
fetlocks.	21
The	21
gallant	21
combatant	21
came	21
well	21
primed	21
by	21
his	21
master	21
the	21
duke	21
as	21
to	21
how	21
he	21
was	21
to	21
bear	21
himself	21
against	21
the	21
valiant	21
Don	21
Quixote	21
of	21
La	21
Mancha;	21
being	21
warned	21
that	21
he	21
must	21
on	21
no	21
account	21
slay	21
him,	21
but	21
strive	21
to	21
shirk	21
the	21
first	21
encounter	21
so	21
as	21
to	21
avoid	21
the	21
risk	21
of	21
killing	21
him,	21
as	21
he	21
was	21
sure	21
to	21
do	21
if	21
he	21
met	21
him	21
full	21
tilt.	21
He	21
crossed	21
the	21
courtyard	21
at	21
a	21
walk,	21
and	21
coming	21
to	21
where	21
the	21
duennas	21
were	21
placed	21
stopped	21
to	21
look	21
at	21
her	21
who	21
demanded	21
him	21
for	21
a	21
husband;	21
the	21
marshal	21
of	21
the	21
field	21
summoned	21
Don	21
Quixote,	21
who	21
had	21
already	21
presented	21
himself	21
in	21
the	21
courtyard,	21
and	21
standing	21
by	21
the	21
side	21
of	21
Tosilos	21
he	21
addressed	21
the	21
duennas,	21
and	21
asked	21
them	21
if	21
they	21
consented	21
that	21
Don	21
Quixote	21
of	21
La	21
Mancha	21
should	21
do	21
battle	21
for	21
their	21
right.	21
They	21
said	21
they	21
did,	21
and	21
that	21
whatever	21
he	21
should	21
do	21
in	21
that	21
behalf	21
they	21
declared	21
rightly	21
done,	21
final	21
and	21
valid.	21
By	21
this	21
time	21
the	21
duke	21
and	21
duchess	21
had	21
taken	21
their	21
places	21
in	21
a	21
gallery	21
commanding	21
the	21
enclosure,	21
which	21
was	21
filled	21
to	21
overflowing	21
with	21
a	21
multitude	21
of	21
people	21
eager	21
to	21
see	21
this	21
perilous	21
and	21
unparalleled	21
encounter.	21
The	21
conditions	21
of	21
the	21
combat	21
were	21
that	21
if	21
Don	21
Quixote	21
proved	21
the	21
victor	21
his	21
antagonist	21
was	21
to	21
marry	21
the	21
daughter	21
of	21
Doña	21
Rodriguez;	21
but	21
if	21
he	21
should	21
be	21
vanquished	21
his	21
opponent	21
was	21
released	21
from	21
the	21
promise	21
that	21
was	21
claimed	21
against	21
him	21
and	21
from	21
all	21
obligations	21
to	21
give	21
satisfaction.	21
The	21
master	21
of	21
the	21
ceremonies	21
apportioned	21
the	21
sun	21
to	21
them,	21
and	21
stationed	21
them,	21
each	21
on	21
the	21
spot	21
where	21
he	21
was	21
to	21
stand.	21
The	21
drums	21
beat,	21
the	21
sound	21
of	21
the	21
trumpets	21
filled	21
the	21
air,	21
the	21
earth	21
trembled	21
under	21
foot,	21
the	21
hearts	21
of	21
the	21
gazing	21
crowd	21
were	21
full	21
of	21
anxiety,	21
some	21
hoping	21
for	21
a	21
happy	21
issue,	21
some	21
apprehensive	21
of	21
an	21
untoward	21
ending	21
to	21
the	21
affair,	21
and	21
lastly,	21
Don	21
Quixote,	21
commending	21
himself	21
with	21
all	21
his	21
heart	21
to	21
God	21
our	21
Lord	21
and	21
to	21
the	21
lady	21
Dulcinea	21
del	21
Toboso,	21
stood	21
waiting	21
for	21
them	21
to	21
give	21
the	21
necessary	21
signal	21
for	21
the	21
onset.	21
Our	21
lacquey,	21
however,	21
was	21
thinking	21
of	21
something	21
very	21
different;	21
he	21
only	21
thought	21
of	21
what	21
I	21
am	21
now	21
going	21
to	21
mention.	21
It	21
seems	21
that	21
as	21
he	21
stood	21
contemplating	21
his	21
enemy	21
she	21
struck	21
him	21
as	21
the	21
most	21
beautiful	21
woman	21
he	21
had	21
ever	21
seen	21
all	21
his	21
life;	21
and	21
the	21
little	21
blind	21
boy	21
whom	21
in	21
our	21
streets	21
they	21
commonly	21
call	21
Love	21
had	21
no	21
mind	21
to	21
let	21
slip	21
the	21
chance	21
of	21
triumphing	21
over	21
a	21
lacquey	21
heart,	21
and	21
adding	21
it	21
to	21
the	21
list	21
of	21
his	21
trophies;	21
and	21
so,	21
stealing	21
gently	21
upon	21
him	21
unseen,	21
he	21
drove	21
a	21
dart	21
two	21
yards	21
long	21
into	21
the	21
poor	21
lacquey’s	21
left	21
side	21
and	21
pierced	21
his	21
heart	21
through	21
and	21
through;	21
which	21
he	21
was	21
able	21
to	21
do	21
quite	21
at	21
his	21
ease,	21
for	21
Love	21
is	21
invisible,	21
and	21
comes	21
in	21
and	21
goes	21
out	21
as	21
he	21
likes,	21
without	21
anyone	21
calling	21
him	21
to	21
account	21
for	21
what	21
he	21
does.	21
Well	21
then,	21
when	21
they	21
gave	21
the	21
signal	21
for	21
the	21
onset	21
our	21
lacquey	21
was	21
in	21
an	21
ecstasy,	21
musing	21
upon	21
the	21
beauty	21
of	21
her	21
whom	21
he	21
had	21
already	21
made	21
mistress	21
of	21
his	21
liberty,	21
and	21
so	21
he	21
paid	21
no	21
attention	21
to	21
the	21
sound	21
of	21
the	21
trumpet,	21
unlike	21
Don	21
Quixote,	21
who	21
was	21
off	21
the	21
instant	21
he	21
heard	21
it,	21
and,	21
at	21
the	21
highest	21
speed	21
Rocinante	21
was	21
capable	21
of,	21
set	21
out	21
to	21
meet	21
his	21
enemy,	21
his	21
good	21
squire	21
Sancho	21
shouting	21
lustily	21
as	21
he	21
saw	21
him	21
start,	21
“God	21
guide	21
thee,	21
cream	21
and	21
flower	21
of	21
knights-errant!	21
God	21
give	21
thee	21
the	21
victory,	21
for	21
thou	21
hast	21
the	21
right	21
on	21
thy	21
side!”	21
But	21
though	21
Tosilos	21
saw	21
Don	21
Quixote	21
coming	21
at	21
him	21
he	21
never	21
stirred	21
a	21
step	21
from	21
the	21
spot	21
where	21
he	21
was	21
posted;	21
and	21
instead	21
of	21
doing	21
so	21
called	21
loudly	21
to	21
the	21
marshal	21
of	21
the	21
field,	21
to	21
whom	21
when	21
he	21
came	21
up	21
to	21
see	21
what	21
he	21
wanted	21
he	21
said,	21
“Señor,	21
is	21
not	21
this	21
battle	21
to	21
decide	21
whether	21
I	21
marry	21
or	21
do	21
not	21
marry	21
that	21
lady?”	21
“Just	21
so,”	21
was	21
the	21
answer.	21
“Well	21
then,”	21
said	21
the	21
lacquey,	21
“I	21
feel	21
qualms	21
of	21
conscience,	21
and	21
I	21
should	21
lay	21
a	21
heavy	21
burden	21
upon	21
it	21
if	21
I	21
were	21
to	21
proceed	21
any	21
further	21
with	21
the	21
combat;	21
I	21
therefore	21
declare	21
that	21
I	21
yield	21
myself	21
vanquished,	21
and	21
that	21
I	21
am	21
willing	21
to	21
marry	21
the	21
lady	21
at	21
once.”	21
The	21
marshal	21
of	21
the	21
field	21
was	21
lost	21
in	21
astonishment	21
at	21
the	21
words	21
of	21
Tosilos;	21
and	21
as	21
he	21
was	21
one	21
of	21
those	21
who	21
were	21
privy	21
to	21
the	21
arrangement	21
of	21
the	21
affair	21
he	21
knew	21
not	21
what	21
to	21
say	21
in	21
reply.	21
Don	21
Quixote	21
pulled	21
up	21
in	21
mid	21
career	21
when	21
he	21
saw	21
that	21
his	21
enemy	21
was	21
not	21
coming	21
on	21
to	21
the	21
attack.	21
The	21
duke	21
could	21
not	21
make	21
out	21
the	21
reason	21
why	21
the	21
battle	21
did	21
not	21
go	21
on;	21
but	21
the	21
marshal	21
of	21
the	21
field	21
hastened	21
to	21
him	21
to	21
let	21
him	21
know	21
what	21
Tosilos	21
said,	21
and	21
he	21
was	21
amazed	21
and	21
extremely	21
angry	21
at	21
it.	21
In	21
the	21
meantime	21
Tosilos	21
advanced	21
to	21
where	21
Doña	21
Rodriguez	21
sat	21
and	21
said	21
in	21
a	21
loud	21
voice,	21
“Señora,	21
I	21
am	21
willing	21
to	21
marry	21
your	21
daughter,	21
and	21
I	21
have	21
no	21
wish	21
to	21
obtain	21
by	21
strife	21
and	21
fighting	21
what	21
I	21
can	21
obtain	21
in	21
peace	21
and	21
without	21
any	21
risk	21
to	21
my	21
life.”	21
The	21
valiant	21
Don	21
Quixote	21
heard	21
him,	21
and	21
said,	21
“As	21
that	21
is	21
the	21
case	21
I	21
am	21
released	21
and	21
absolved	21
from	21
my	21
promise;	21
let	21
them	21
marry	21
by	21
all	21
means,	21
and	21
as	21
‘God	21
our	21
Lord	21
has	21
given	21
her,	21
may	21
Saint	21
Peter	21
add	21
his	21
blessing.’”	21
The	21
duke	21
had	21
now	21
descended	21
to	21
the	21
courtyard	21
of	21
the	21
castle,	21
and	21
going	21
up	21
to	21
Tosilos	21
he	21
said	21
to	21
him,	21
“Is	21
it	21
true,	21
sir	21
knight,	21
that	21
you	21
yield	21
yourself	21
vanquished,	21
and	21
that	21
moved	21
by	21
scruples	21
of	21
conscience	21
you	21
wish	21
to	21
marry	21
this	21
damsel?”	21
“It	21
is,	21
señor,”	21
replied	21
Tosilos.	21
“And	21
he	21
does	21
well,”	21
said	21
Sancho,	21
“for	21
what	21
thou	21
hast	21
to	21
give	21
to	21
the	21
mouse,	21
give	21
to	21
the	21
cat,	21
and	21
it	21
will	21
save	21
thee	21
all	21
trouble.”	21
Tosilos	21
meanwhile	21
was	21
trying	21
to	21
unlace	21
his	21
helmet,	21
and	21
he	21
begged	21
them	21
to	21
come	21
to	21
his	21
help	21
at	21
once,	21
as	21
his	21
power	21
of	21
breathing	21
was	21
failing	21
him,	21
and	21
he	21
could	21
not	21
remain	21
so	21
long	21
shut	21
up	21
in	21
that	21
confined	21
space.	21
They	21
removed	21
it	21
in	21
all	21
haste,	21
and	21
his	21
lacquey	21
features	21
were	21
revealed	21
to	21
public	21
gaze.	21
At	21
this	21
sight	21
Doña	21
Rodriguez	21
and	21
her	21
daughter	21
raised	21
a	21
mighty	21
outcry,	21
exclaiming,	21
“This	21
is	21
a	21
trick!	21
This	21
is	21
a	21
trick!	21
They	21
have	21
put	21
Tosilos,	21
my	21
lord	21
the	21
duke’s	21
lacquey,	21
upon	21
us	21
in	21
place	21
of	21
the	21
real	21
husband.	21
The	21
justice	21
of	21
God	21
and	21
the	21
king	21
against	21
such	21
trickery,	21
not	21
to	21
say	21
roguery!”	21
“Do	21
not	21
distress	21
yourselves,	21
ladies,”	21
said	21
Don	21
Quixote;	21
“for	21
this	21
is	21
no	21
trickery	21
or	21
roguery;	21
or	21
if	21
it	21
is,	21
it	21
is	21
not	21
the	21
duke	21
who	21
is	21
at	21
the	21
bottom	21
of	21
it,	21
but	21
those	21
wicked	21
enchanters	21
who	21
persecute	21
me,	21
and	21
who,	21
jealous	21
of	21
my	21
reaping	21
the	21
glory	21
of	21
this	21
victory,	21
have	21
turned	21
your	21
husband’s	21
features	21
into	21
those	21
of	21
this	21
person,	21
who	21
you	21
say	21
is	21
a	21
lacquey	21
of	21
the	21
duke’s;	21
take	21
my	21
advice,	21
and	21
notwithstanding	21
the	21
malice	21
of	21
my	21
enemies	21
marry	21
him,	21
for	21
beyond	21
a	21
doubt	21
he	21
is	21
the	21
one	21
you	21
wish	21
for	21
a	21
husband.”	21
When	21
the	21
duke	21
heard	21
this	21
all	21
his	21
anger	21
was	21
near	21
vanishing	21
in	21
a	21
fit	21
of	21
laughter,	21
and	21
he	21
said,	21
“The	21
things	21
that	21
happen	21
to	21
Señor	21
Don	21
Quixote	21
are	21
so	21
extraordinary	21
that	21
I	21
am	21
ready	21
to	21
believe	21
this	21
lacquey	21
of	21
mine	21
is	21
not	21
one;	21
but	21
let	21
us	21
adopt	21
this	21
plan	21
and	21
device;	21
let	21
us	21
put	21
off	21
the	21
marriage	21
for,	21
say,	21
a	21
fortnight,	21
and	21
let	21
us	21
keep	21
this	21
person	21
about	21
whom	21
we	21
are	21
uncertain	21
in	21
close	21
confinement,	21
and	21
perhaps	21
in	21
the	21
course	21
of	21
that	21
time	21
he	21
may	21
return	21
to	21
his	21
original	21
shape;	21
for	21
the	21
spite	21
which	21
the	21
enchanters	21
entertain	21
against	21
Señor	21
Don	21
Quixote	21
cannot	21
last	21
so	21
long,	21
especially	21
as	21
it	21
is	21
of	21
so	21
little	21
advantage	21
to	21
them	21
to	21
practise	21
these	21
deceptions	21
and	21
transformations.”	21
“Oh,	21
señor,”	21
said	21
Sancho,	21
“those	21
scoundrels	21
are	21
well	21
used	21
to	21
changing	21
whatever	21
concerns	21
my	21
master	21
from	21
one	21
thing	21
into	21
another.	21
A	21
knight	21
that	21
he	21
overcame	21
some	21
time	21
back,	21
called	21
the	21
Knight	21
of	21
the	21
Mirrors,	21
they	21
turned	21
into	21
the	21
shape	21
of	21
the	21
bachelor	21
Samson	21
Carrasco	21
of	21
our	21
town	21
and	21
a	21
great	21
friend	21
of	21
ours;	21
and	21
my	21
lady	21
Dulcinea	21
del	21
Toboso	21
they	21
have	21
turned	21
into	21
a	21
common	21
country	21
wench;	21
so	21
I	21
suspect	21
this	21
lacquey	21
will	21
have	21
to	21
live	21
and	21
die	21
a	21
lacquey	21
all	21
the	21
days	21
of	21
his	21
life.”	21
Here	21
the	21
Rodriguez’s	21
daughter	21
exclaimed,	21
“Let	21
him	21
be	21
who	21
he	21
may,	21
this	21
man	21
that	21
claims	21
me	21
for	21
a	21
wife;	21
I	21
am	21
thankful	21
to	21
him	21
for	21
the	21
same,	21
for	21
I	21
had	21
rather	21
be	21
the	21
lawful	21
wife	21
of	21
a	21
lacquey	21
than	21
the	21
cheated	21
mistress	21
of	21
a	21
gentleman;	21
though	21
he	21
who	21
played	21
me	21
false	21
is	21
nothing	21
of	21
the	21
kind.”	21
To	21
be	21
brief,	21
all	21
the	21
talk	21
and	21
all	21
that	21
had	21
happened	21
ended	21
in	21
Tosilos	21
being	21
shut	21
up	21
until	21
it	21
was	21
seen	21
how	21
his	21
transformation	21
turned	21
out.	21
All	21
hailed	21
Don	21
Quixote	21
as	21
victor,	21
but	21
the	21
greater	21
number	21
were	21
vexed	21
and	21
disappointed	21
at	21
finding	21
that	21
the	21
combatants	21
they	21
had	21
been	21
so	21
anxiously	21
waiting	21
for	21
had	21
not	21
battered	21
one	21
another	21
to	21
pieces,	21
just	21
as	21
the	21
boys	21
are	21
disappointed	21
when	21
the	21
man	21
they	21
are	21
waiting	21
to	21
see	21
hanged	21
does	21
not	21
come	21
out,	21
because	21
the	21
prosecution	21
or	21
the	21
court	21
has	21
pardoned	21
him.	21
The	21
people	21
dispersed,	21
the	21
duke	21
and	21
Don	21
Quixote	21
returned	21
to	21
the	21
castle,	21
they	21
locked	21
up	21
Tosilos,	21
Doña	21
Rodriguez	21
and	21
her	21
daughter	21
remained	21
perfectly	21
contented	21
when	21
they	21
saw	21
that	21
any	21
way	21
the	21
affair	21
must	21
end	21
in	21
marriage,	21
and	21
Tosilos	21
wanted	21
nothing	21
else.	21

Don	21
Quixote	21
now	21
felt	21
it	21
right	21
to	21
quit	21
a	21
life	21
of	21
such	21
idleness	21
as	21
he	21
was	21
leading	21
in	21
the	21
castle;	21
for	21
he	21
fancied	21
that	21
he	21
was	21
making	21
himself	21
sorely	21
missed	21
by	21
suffering	21
himself	21
to	21
remain	21
shut	21
up	21
and	21
inactive	21
amid	21
the	21
countless	21
luxuries	21
and	21
enjoyments	21
his	21
hosts	21
lavished	21
upon	21
him	21
as	21
a	21
knight,	21
and	21
he	21
felt	21
too	21
that	21
he	21
would	21
have	21
to	21
render	21
a	21
strict	21
account	21
to	21
heaven	21
of	21
that	21
indolence	21
and	21
seclusion;	21
and	21
so	21

the	21
duke	21
and	21
duchess	21
to	21
grant	21
him	21
permission	21
to	21
take	21
his	21
departure.	21
They	21
gave	21
it,	21
showing	21
at	21
the	21
same	21
time	21
that	21
they	21
were	21
very	21
sorry	21
he	21
was	21
leaving	21
them.	21

The	21
duchess	21
gave	21
his	21
wife’s	21
letters	21
to	21
Sancho	21
Panza,	21
who	21
shed	21
tears	21
over	21
them,	21
saying,	21
“Who	21
would	21
have	21
thought	21
that	21
such	21
grand	21
hopes	21
as	21
the	21
news	21
of	21
my	21
government	21
bred	21
in	21
my	21
wife	21
Teresa	21
Panza’s	21
breast	21
would	21
end	21
in	21
my	21
going	21
back	21
now	21
to	21
the	21
vagabond	21
adventures	21
of	21
my	21
master	21
Don	21
Quixote	21
of	21
La	21
Mancha?	21
Still	21
I’m	21
glad	21
to	21
see	21
my	21
Teresa	21
behaved	21
as	21
she	21
ought	21
in	21
sending	21
the	21
acorns,	21
for	21
if	21
she	21
had	21
not	21
sent	21
them	21
I’d	21
have	21
been	21
sorry,	21
and	21
she’d	21
have	21
shown	21
herself	21
ungrateful.	21
It	21
is	21
a	21
comfort	21
to	21
me	21
that	21
they	21
can’t	21
call	21
that	21
present	21
a	21
bribe;	21
for	21
I	21
had	21
got	21
the	21
government	21
already	21
when	21
she	21
sent	21
them,	21
and	21
it’s	21
but	21
reasonable	21
that	21
those	21
who	21
have	21
had	21
a	21
good	21
turn	21
done	21
them	21
should	21
show	21
their	21
gratitude,	21
if	21
it’s	21
only	21
with	21
a	21
trifle.	21
After	21
all	21
I	21
went	21
into	21
the	21
government	21
naked,	21
and	21
I	21
come	21
out	21
of	21
it	21
naked;	21
so	21
I	21
can	21
say	21
with	21
a	21
safe	21
conscience—and	21
that’s	21
no	21
small	21
matter—‘naked	21
I	21
was	21
born,	21
naked	21
I	21
find	21
myself,	21
I	21
neither	21
lose	21
nor	21
gain.’”	21
Thus	21
did	21
Sancho	21
soliloquise	21
on	21
the	21
day	21
of	21
their	21
departure,	21
as	21
Don	21
Quixote,	21
who	21
had	21
the	21
night	21
before	21
taken	21
leave	21
of	21
the	21
duke	21
and	21
duchess,	21
coming	21
out	21
made	21
his	21
appearance	21
at	21
an	21
early	21
hour	21
in	21
full	21
armour	21
in	21
the	21
courtyard	21
of	21
the	21
castle.	21
The	21
whole	21
household	21
of	21
the	21
castle	21
were	21
watching	21
him	21
from	21
the	21
corridors,	21
and	21
the	21
duke	21
and	21
duchess,	21
too,	21
came	21
out	21
to	21
see	21
him.	21
Sancho	21
was	21
mounted	21
on	21
his	21
Dapple,	21
with	21
his	21
alforjas,	21
valise,	21
and	21
proven	21
supremely	21
happy	21
because	21
the	21
duke’s	21
majordomo,	21
the	21
same	21
that	21
had	21
acted	21
the	21
part	21
of	21
the	21
Trifaldi,	21
had	21
given	21
him	21
a	21
little	21
purse	21
with	21
two	21
hundred	21
gold	21
crowns	21
to	21
meet	21
the	21
necessary	21
expenses	21
of	21
the	21
road,	21
but	21
of	21
this	21
Don	21
Quixote	21
knew	21
nothing	21
as	21
yet.	21
While	21
all	21
were,	21
as	21
has	21
been	21
said,	21
observing	21
him,	21
suddenly	21
from	21
among	21
the	21
duennas	21
and	21
handmaidens	21
the	21
impudent	21
and	21
witty	21
Altisidora	21
lifted	21
up	21
her	21
voice	21
and	21
said	21
in	21
pathetic	21
tones:	21
Give	21
ear,	21
cruel	21
knight;	21
Draw	21
rein;	21
where’s	21
the	21
need	21
Of	21
spurring	21
the	21
flanks	21
Of	21
that	21
ill-broken	21
steed?	21
From	21
what	21
art	21
thou	21
flying?	21
No	21
dragon	21
I	21
am,	21
Not	21
even	21
a	21
sheep,	21
But	21
a	21
tender	21
young	21
lamb.	21
Thou	21
hast	21
jilted	21
a	21
maiden	21
As	21
fair	21
to	21
behold	21
As	21
nymph	21
of	21
Diana	21
Or	21
Venus	21
of	21
old.	21
Bireno,	21
Æneas,	21
what	21
worse	21
shall	21
I	21
call	21
thee?	21
Barabbas	21
go	21
with	21
thee!	21
All	21
evil	21
befall	21
thee!	21
In	21
thy	21
claws,	21
ruthless	21
robber,	21
Thou	21
bearest	21
away	21
The	21
heart	21
of	21
a	21
meek	21
Loving	21
maid	21
for	21
thy	21
prey,	21
Three	21
kerchiefs	21
thou	21
stealest,	21
And	21
garters	21
a	21
pair,	21
From	21
legs	21
than	21
the	21
whitest	21
Of	21
marble	21
more	21
fair;	21
And	21
the	21
sighs	21
that	21
pursue	21
thee	21
Would	21
burn	21
to	21
the	21
ground	21
Two	21
thousand	21
Troy	21
Towns,	21
If	21
so	21
many	21
were	21
found.	21
Bireno,	21
Æneas,	21
what	21
worse	21
shall	21
I	21
call	21
thee?	21
Barabbas	21
go	21
with	21
thee!	21
All	21
evil	21
befall	21
thee!	21
May	21
no	21
bowels	21
of	21
mercy	21
To	21
Sancho	21
be	21
granted,	21
And	21
thy	21
Dulcinea	21
Be	21
left	21
still	21
enchanted,	21
May	21
thy	21
falsehood	21
to	21
me	21
Find	21
its	21
punishment	21
in	21
her,	21
For	21
in	21
my	21
land	21
the	21
just	21
Often	21
pays	21
for	21
the	21
sinner.	21
May	21
thy	21
grandest	21
adventures	21
Discomfitures	21
prove,	21
May	21
thy	21
joys	21
be	21
all	21
dreams,	21
And	21
forgotten	21
thy	21
love.	21
Bireno,	21
Æneas,	21
what	21

I	21
call	21
thee?	21
Barabbas	21
go	21
with	21
thee!	21
All	21
evil	21
befall	21
thee!	21
May	21
thy	21
name	21
be	21
abhorred	21
For	21
thy	21
conduct	21
to	21
ladies,	21
From	21
London	21
to	21
England,	21
From	21
Seville	21
to	21
Cadiz;	21
May	21
thy	21
cards	21
be	21
unlucky,	21
Thy	21
hands	21
contain	21
ne’er	21
a	21
King,	21
seven,	21
or	21
ace	21
When	21
thou	21
playest	21
primera;	21
When	21
thy	21
corns	21
are	21
cut	21
May	21
it	21
be	21
to	21
the	21
quick;	21
When	21
thy	21
grinders	21
are	21
drawn	21
May	21
the	21
roots	21
of	21
them	21
stick.	21
Bireno,	21
Æneas,	21
what	21
worse	21
shall	21
I	21
call	21
thee?	21
Barabbas	21
go	21
with	21
thee!	21
All	21
evil	21
befall	21
thee!	21
All	21
the	21
while	21
the	21
unhappy	21
Altisidora	21
was	21
bewailing	21
herself	21
in	21
the	21
above	21
strain	21
Don	21
Quixote	21
stood	21
staring	21
at	21
her;	21
and	21
without	21
uttering	21
a	21
word	21
in	21
reply	21
to	21
her	21
he	21
turned	21
round	21
to	21
Sancho	21
and	21
said,	21
“Sancho	21
my	21
friend,	21
I	21
conjure	21
thee	21
by	21
the	21
life	21
of	21
thy	21
forefathers	21
tell	21
me	21
the	21
truth;	21
say,	21
hast	21
thou	21
by	21
any	21
chance	21
taken	21
the	21
three	21
kerchiefs	21
and	21
the	21
garters	21
this	21
love-sick	21
maid	21
speaks	21
of?”	21
To	21
this	21
Sancho	21
made	21
answer,	21
“The	21
three	21
kerchiefs	21
I	21
have;	21
but	21
the	21
garters,	21
as	21
much	21
as	21
‘over	21
the	21
hills	21
of	21
Úbeda.’”	21
The	21
duchess	21
was	21
amazed	21
at	21
Altisidora’s	21
assurance;	21
she	21
knew	21
that	21
she	21
was	21
bold,	21
lively,	21
and	21
impudent,	21
but	21
not	21
so	21
much	21
so	21
as	21
to	21
venture	21
to	21
make	21
free	21
in	21
this	21
fashion;	21
and	21
not	21
being	21
prepared	21
for	21
the	21
joke,	21
her	21
astonishment	21
was	21
all	21
the	21
greater.	21
The	21
duke	21
had	21
a	21
mind	21
to	21
keep	21
up	21
the	21
sport,	21
so	21
he	21
said,	21
“It	21
does	21
not	21
seem	21
to	21
me	21
well	21
done	21
in	21
you,	21
sir	21
knight,	21
that	21
after	21
having	21
received	21
the	21
hospitality	21
that	21
has	21
been	21
offered	21
you	21
in	21
this	21
very	21
castle,	21
you	21
should	21
have	21
ventured	21
to	21
carry	21
off	21
even	21
three	21
kerchiefs,	21
not	21
to	21
say	21
my	21
handmaid’s	21
garters.	21
It	21
shows	21
a	21
bad	21
heart	21
and	21
does	21
not	21
tally	21
with	21
your	21
reputation.	21
Restore	21
her	21
garters,	21
or	21
else	21
I	21
defy	21
you	21
to	21
mortal	21
combat,	21
for	21
I	21
am	21
not	21
afraid	21
of	21
rascally	21
enchanters	21
changing	21
or	21
altering	21
my	21
features	21
as	21
they	21
changed	21
his	21
who	21
encountered	21
you	21
into	21
those	21
of	21
my	21
lacquey,	21
Tosilos.”	21
“God	21
forbid,”	21
said	21
Don	21
Quixote,	21
“that	21
I	21
should	21
draw	21
my	21
sword	21
against	21
your	21
illustrious	21
person	21
from	21
which	21
I	21
have	21
received	21
such	21
great	21
favours.	21
The	21
kerchiefs	21
I	21
will	21
restore,	21
as	21
Sancho	21
says	21
he	21
has	21
them;	21
as	21
to	21
the	21
garters	21
that	21
is	21
impossible,	21
for	21
I	21
have	21
not	21
got	21
them,	21
neither	21
has	21
he;	21
and	21
if	21
your	21
handmaiden	21
here	21
will	21
look	21
in	21
her	21
hiding-places,	21
depend	21
upon	21
it	21
she	21
will	21
find	21
them.	21
I	21
have	21
never	21
been	21
a	21
thief,	21
my	21
lord	21
duke,	21
nor	21
do	21
I	21
mean	21
to	21
be	21
so	21
long	21
as	21
I	21
live,	21
if	21
God	21
cease	21
not	21
to	21
have	21
me	21
in	21
his	21
keeping.	21
This	21
damsel	21
by	21
her	21
own	21
confession	21
speaks	21
as	21
one	21
in	21
love,	21
for	21
which	21
I	21
am	21
not	21
to	21
blame,	21
and	21
therefore	21
need	21
not	21
ask	21
pardon,	21
either	21
of	21
her	21
or	21
of	21
your	21
excellence,	21
whom	21
I	21
entreat	21
to	21
have	21
a	21
better	21
opinion	21
of	21
me,	21
and	21
once	21
more	21
to	21
give	21
me	21
leave	21
to	21
pursue	21
my	21
journey.”	21
“And	21
may	21
God	21
so	21
prosper	21
it,	21
Señor	21
Don	21
Quixote,”	21
said	21
the	21
duchess,	21
“that	21
we	21
may	21
always	21
hear	21
good	21
news	21
of	21
your	21
exploits;	21
God	21
speed	21
you;	21
for	21
the	21
longer	21
you	21
stay,	21
the	21
more	21
you	21
inflame	21
the	21
hearts	21
of	21
the	21
damsels	21
who	21
behold	21
you;	21
and	21
as	21
for	21
this	21
one	21
of	21
mine,	21
I	21
will	21
so	21
chastise	21
her	21
that	21
she	21
will	21
not	21
transgress	21
again,	21
either	21
with	21
her	21
eyes	21
or	21
with	21
her	21
words.”	21
“One	21
word	21
and	21
no	21
more,	21
O	21
valiant	21
Don	21
Quixote,	21
I	21
ask	21
you	21
to	21
hear,”	21
said	21
Altisidora,	21
“and	21
that	21
is	21
that	21
I	21
beg	21
your	21
pardon	21
about	21
the	21
theft	21
of	21
the	21
garters;	21
for	21
by	21
God	21
and	21
upon	21
my	21
soul	21
I	21
have	21
got	21
them	21
on,	21
and	21
I	21
have	21
fallen	21
into	21
the	21
same	21
blunder	21
as	21
he	21
did	21
who	21
went	21
looking	21
for	21
his	21
ass	21
being	21
all	21
the	21
while	21
mounted	21
on	21
it.”	21
“Didn’t	21
I	21
say	21
so?”	21
said	21
Sancho.	21
“I’m	21
a	21
likely	21
one	21
to	21
hide	21
thefts!	21
Why	21
if	21
I	21
wanted	21
to	21
deal	21
in	21
them,	21
opportunities	21
came	21
ready	21
enough	21
to	21
me	21
in	21
my	21
government.”	21
Don	21
Quixote	21
bowed	21
his	21
head,	21
and	21
saluted	21
the	21
duke	21
and	21
duchess	21
and	21
all	21
the	21
bystanders,	21
and	21
wheeling	21
Rocinante	21
round,	21
Sancho	21
following	21
him	21
on	21
Dapple,	21
he	21
rode	21
out	21
of	21
the	21
castle,	21
shaping	21
his	21
course	21
for	21
Saragossa.	21

of	21
the	21
most	21
precious	21
gifts	21
that	21
heaven	21
has	21
bestowed	21
upon	21
men;	21
no	21
treasures	21
that	21
the	21
earth	21
holds	21
buried	21
or	21
the	21
sea	21
conceals	21
can	21
compare	21
with	21
it;	21
for	21
freedom,	21
as	21
for	21
honour,	21
life	21
may	21
and	21
should	21
be	21
ventured;	21
and	21
on	21
the	21
other	21
hand,	21
captivity	21
is	21
the	21
greatest	21
evil	21
that	21
can	21
fall	21
to	21
the	21
lot	21
of	21
man.	21
I	21
say	21
this,	21
Sancho,	21
because	21
thou	21
hast	21
seen	21
the	21
good	21
cheer,	21
the	21
abundance	21
we	21
have	21
enjoyed	21
in	21
this	21
castle	21
we	21
are	21
leaving;	21
well	21
then,	21
amid	21
those	21
dainty	21
banquets	21
and	21
snow-cooled	21
beverages	21
I	21
felt	21
as	21
though	21
I	21
were	21
undergoing	21
the	21
straits	21
of	21
hunger,	21
because	21
I	21
did	21
not	21
enjoy	21
them	21
with	21
the	21
same	21
freedom	21
as	21
if	21
they	21
had	21
been	21
mine	21
own;	21
for	21
the	21
sense	21
of	21
being	21
under	21
an	21
obligation	21
to	21
return	21
benefits	21
and	21
favours	21
received	21
is	21
a	21
restraint	21
that	21
checks	21
the	21
independence	21
of	21
the	21
spirit.	21
Happy	21
he,	21
to	21
whom	21
heaven	21
has	21
given	21
a	21
piece	21
of	21
bread	21
for	21
which	21
he	21
is	21
not	21
bound	21
to	21
give	21
thanks	21
to	21
any	21
but	21
heaven	21
itself!”	21
“For	21
all	21
your	21
worship	21
says,”	21
said	21
Sancho,	21
“it	21
is	21
not	21
becoming	21
that	21
there	21
should	21
be	21
no	21
thanks	21
on	21
our	21
part	21
for	21
two	21
hundred	21
gold	21
crowns	21
that	21
the	21
duke’s	21
majordomo	21
has	21
given	21
me	21
in	21
a	21
little	21
purse	21
which	21
I	21
carry	21
next	21
my	21
heart,	21
like	21
a	21
warming	21
plaster	21
or	21
comforter,	21
to	21
meet	21
any	21
chance	21
calls;	21
for	21
we	21
shan’t	21
always	21
find	21
castles	21
where	21
they’ll	21
entertain	21
us;	21
now	21
and	21
then	21
we	21
may	21
light	21
upon	21
roadside	21
inns	21
where	21
they’ll	21
cudgel	21
us.”	21
In	21
conversation	21
of	21
this	21
sort	21
the	21
knight	21
and	21
squire	21
errant	21
were	21
pursuing	21
their	21
journey,	21
when,	21
after	21
they	21
had	21
gone	21
a	21
little	21
more	21
than	21
half	21
a	21
league,	21
they	21
perceived	21
some	21
dozen	21
men	21
dressed	21
like	21
labourers	21
stretched	21
upon	21
their	21
cloaks	21
on	21
the	21
grass	21
of	21
a	21
green	21
meadow	21
eating	21
their	21
dinner.	21
They	21
had	21
beside	21
them	21
what	21
seemed	21
to	21
be	21
white	21
sheets	21
concealing	21
some	21
objects	21
under	21
them,	21
standing	21
upright	21
or	21
lying	21
flat,	21
and	21
arranged	21
at	21
intervals.	21
Don	21
Quixote	21
approached	21
the	21
diners,	21
and,	21
saluting	21
them	21
courteously	21
first,	21
he	21
asked	21
them	21
what	21
it	21
was	21
those	21
cloths	21
covered.	21
“Señor,”	21
answered	21
one	21
of	21
the	21
party,	21
“under	21
these	21
cloths	21
are	21
some	21
images	21
carved	21
in	21
relief	21
intended	21
for	21
a	21
retablo	21
we	21
are	21
putting	21
up	21
in	21
our	21
village;	21
we	21
carry	21
them	21
covered	21
up	21
that	21
they	21
may	21
not	21
be	21
soiled,	21
and	21
on	21
our	21
shoulders	21
that	21
they	21
may	21
not	21
be	21
broken.”	21
“With	21
your	21
good	21
leave,”	21
said	21
Don	21
Quixote,	21
“I	21
should	21
like	21
to	21
see	21
them;	21
for	21
images	21
that	21
are	21
carried	21
so	21
carefully	21
no	21
doubt	21
must	21
be	21
fine	21
ones.”	21
“I	21
should	21
think	21
they	21
were!”	21
said	21
the	21
other;	21
“let	21
the	21
money	21
they	21
cost	21
speak	21
for	21
that;	21
for	21
as	21
a	21
matter	21
of	21
fact	21
there	21
is	21
not	21
one	21
of	21
them	21
that	21
does	21
not	21
stand	21
us	21
in	21
more	21
than	21
fifty	21
ducats;	21
and	21
that	21
your	21
worship	21
may	21
judge;	21
wait	21
a	21
moment,	21
and	21
you	21
shall	21
see	21
with	21
your	21
own	21
eyes;”	21
and	21
getting	21
up	21
from	21
his	21
dinner	21
he	21
went	21
and	21
uncovered	21
the	21
first	21
image,	21
which	21
proved	21
to	21
be	21
one	21
of	21
Saint	21
George	21
on	21
horseback	21
with	21
a	21
serpent	21
writhing	21
at	21
his	21
feet	21
and	21
the	21
lance	21
thrust	21
down	21
its	21
throat	21
with	21
all	21
that	21
fierceness	21
that	21
is	21
usually	21
depicted.	21
The	21
whole	21
group	21
was	21
one	21
blaze	21
of	21
gold,	21
as	21
the	21
saying	21
is.	21
On	21
seeing	21
it	21
Don	21
Quixote	21
said,	21
“That	21
knight	21
was	21
one	21
of	21
the	21
best	21
knights-errant	21
the	21
army	21
of	21
heaven	21
ever	21
owned;	21
he	21
was	21
called	21
Don	21
Saint	21
George,	21
and	21
he	21
was	21
moreover	21
a	21
defender	21
of	21
maidens.	21
Let	21
us	21
see	21
this	21
next	21
one.”	21
The	21
man	21
uncovered	21
it,	21
and	21
it	21
was	21
seen	21
to	21
be	21
that	21
of	21
Saint	21
Martin	21
on	21
his	21
horse,	21
dividing	21
his	21
cloak	21
with	21
the	21
beggar.	21
The	21
instant	21
Don	21
Quixote	21
saw	21
it	21
he	21
said,	21
“This	21
knight	21
too	21
was	21
one	21
of	21
the	21
Christian	21
adventurers,	21
but	21
I	21
believe	21
he	21
was	21
generous	21
rather	21
than	21
valiant,	21
as	21
thou	21
mayest	21
perceive,	21
Sancho,	21
by	21
his	21
dividing	21
his	21
cloak	21
with	21
the	21
beggar	21
and	21
giving	21
him	21
half	21
of	21
it;	21
no	21
doubt	21
it	21
was	21
winter	21
at	21
the	21
time,	21
for	21
otherwise	21
he	21
would	21
have	21
given	21
him	21
the	21
whole	21
of	21
it,	21
so	21
charitable	21
was	21
he.”	21
“It	21
was	21
not	21
that,	21
most	21
likely,”	21
said	21
Sancho,	21
“but	21
that	21
he	21
held	21
with	21
the	21
proverb	21
that	21
says,	21
‘For	21
giving	21
and	21
keeping	21
there’s	21
need	21
of	21
brains.’”	21
Don	21
Quixote	21
laughed,	21
and	21
asked	21
them	21
to	21
take	21
off	21
the	21
next	21
cloth,	21
underneath	21
which	21
was	21
seen	21
the	21
image	21
of	21
the	21
patron	21
saint	21
of	21
the	21
Spains	21
seated	21
on	21
horseback,	21
his	21
sword	21
stained	21
with	21
blood,	21
trampling	21
on	21
Moors	21
and	21
treading	21
heads	21
underfoot;	21
and	21
on	21
seeing	21
it	21
Don	21
Quixote	21
exclaimed,	21
“Ay,	21
this	21
is	21
a	21
knight,	21
and	21
of	21
the	21
squadrons	21
of	21
Christ!	21
This	21
one	21
is	21
called	21
Don	21
Saint	21
James	21
the	21
Moorslayer,	21
one	21
of	21
the	21
bravest	21
saints	21
and	21
knights	21
the	21
world	21
ever	21
had	21
or	21
heaven	21
has	21
now.”	21
They	21
then	21
raised	21
another	21
cloth	21
which	21
it	21
appeared	21
covered	21
Saint	21
Paul	21
falling	21
from	21
his	21
horse,	21
with	21
all	21
the	21
details	21
that	21
are	21
usually	21
given	21
in	21
representations	21
of	21
his	21
conversion.	21
When	21
Don	21
Quixote	21
saw	21
it,	21
rendered	21
in	21
such	21
lifelike	21
style	21
that	21
one	21
would	21
have	21
said	21
Christ	21
was	21
speaking	21
and	21
Paul	21
answering,	21
“This,”	21
he	21
said,	21
“was	21
in	21
his	21
time	21
the	21
greatest	21
enemy	21
that	21
the	21
Church	21
of	21
God	21
our	21
Lord	21
had,	21
and	21
the	21
greatest	21
champion	21
it	21
will	21
ever	21
have;	21
a	21
knight-errant	21
in	21
life,	21
a	21
steadfast	21
saint	21
in	21
death,	21
an	21
untiring	21
labourer	21
in	21
the	21
Lord’s	21
vineyard,	21
a	21
teacher	21
of	21
the	21
Gentiles,	21
whose	21
school	21
was	21
heaven,	21
and	21
whose	21
instructor	21
and	21
master	21
was	21
Jesus	21
Christ	21
himself.”	21
There	21
were	21
no	21
more	21
images,	21
so	21
Don	21
Quixote	21
bade	21
them	21
cover	21
them	21
up	21
again,	21
and	21
said	21
to	21
those	21
who	21
had	21
brought	21
them,	21
“I	21
take	21
it	21
as	21
a	21
happy	21
omen,	21
brothers,	21
to	21
have	21
seen	21
what	21
I	21
have;	21
for	21
these	21
saints	21
and	21
knights	21
were	21
of	21
the	21
same	21
profession	21
as	21
myself,	21
which	21
is	21
the	21
calling	21
of	21
arms;	21
only	21
there	21
is	21
this	21
difference	21
between	21
them	21
and	21
me,	21
that	21
they	21
were	21
saints,	21
and	21
fought	21
with	21
divine	21
weapons,	21
and	21
I	21
am	21
a	21
sinner	21
and	21
fight	21
with	21
human	21
ones.	21
They	21
won	21
heaven	21
by	21
force	21
of	21
arms,	21
for	21
heaven	21
suffereth	21
violence;	21
and	21
I,	21
so	21
far,	21
know	21
not	21
what	21
I	21
have	21
won	21
by	21
dint	21
of	21
my	21
sufferings;	21
but	21
if	21
my	21
Dulcinea	21
del	21
Toboso	21
were	21
to	21
be	21
released	21
from	21
hers,	21
perhaps	21
with	21
mended	21
fortunes	21
and	21
a	21
mind	21
restored	21
to	21
itself	21
I	21
might	21
direct	21
my	21
steps	21
in	21
a	21
better	21
path	21
than	21
I	21
am	21
following	21
at	21
present.”	21
“May	21
God	21
hear	21
and	21
sin	21
be	21
deaf,”	21
said	21
Sancho	21
to	21
this.	21
The	21
men	21
were	21
filled	21
with	21
wonder,	21
as	21
well	21
at	21
the	21
figure	21
as	21
at	21
the	21
words	21
of	21
Don	21
Quixote,	21
though	21
they	21
did	21
not	21
understand	21
one	21
half	21
of	21
what	21
he	21
meant	21
by	21
them.	21
They	21
finished	21
their	21
dinner,	21
took	21
their	21
images	21
on	21
their	21
backs,	21
and	21
bidding	21
farewell	21
to	21
Don	21
Quixote	21
resumed	21
their	21
journey.	21
Sancho	21
was	21
amazed	21
afresh	21
at	21
the	21
extent	21
of	21
his	21
master’s	21
knowledge,	21
as	21
much	21
as	21
if	21
he	21
had	21
never	21
known	21
him,	21
for	21
it	21
seemed	21
to	21
him	21
that	21
there	21
was	21
no	21
story	21
or	21
event	21
in	21
the	21
world	21
that	21
he	21
had	21
not	21
at	21
his	21
fingers’	21
ends	21
and	21
fixed	21
in	21
his	21
memory,	21
and	21
he	21
said	21
to	21
him,	21
“In	21
truth,	21
master	21
mine,	21
if	21
this	21
that	21
has	21
happened	21
to	21
us	21
to-day	21
is	21
to	21
be	21
called	21
an	21
adventure,	21
it	21
has	21
been	21
one	21
of	21
the	21
sweetest	21
and	21
pleasantest	21
that	21
have	21
befallen	21
us	21
in	21
the	21
whole	21
course	21
of	21
our	21
travels;	21
we	21
have	21
come	21
out	21
of	21
it	21
unbelaboured	21
and	21
undismayed,	21
neither	21
have	21
we	21
drawn	21
sword	21
nor	21
have	21
we	21
smitten	21
the	21
earth	21
with	21
our	21
bodies,	21
nor	21
have	21
we	21
been	21
left	21
famishing;	21
blessed	21
be	21
God	21
that	21
he	21
has	21
let	21
me	21
see	21
such	21
a	21
thing	21
with	21
my	21
own	21
eyes!”	21
“Thou	21
sayest	21
well,	21
Sancho,”	21
said	21
Don	21
Quixote,	21
“but	21
remember	21
all	21
times	21
are	21
not	21
alike	21
nor	21
do	21
they	21
always	21
run	21
the	21
same	21
way;	21
and	21
these	21
things	21
the	21
vulgar	21
commonly	21
call	21
omens,	21
which	21
are	21
not	21
based	21
upon	21
any	21
natural	21
reason,	21
will	21
by	21
him	21
who	21
is	21
wise	21
be	21
esteemed	21
and	21
reckoned	21
happy	21
accidents	21
merely.	21
One	21
of	21
these	21
believers	21
in	21
omens	21
will	21
get	21
up	21
of	21
a	21
morning,	21
leave	21
his	21
house,	21
and	21
meet	21
a	21
friar	21
of	21
the	21
order	21
of	21
the	21
blessed	21
Saint	21
Francis,	21
and,	21
as	21
if	21
he	21
had	21
met	21
a	21
griffin,	21
he	21
will	21
turn	21
about	21
and	21
go	21
home.	21
With	21
another	21
Mendoza	21
the	21
salt	21
is	21
spilt	21
on	21
his	21
table,	21
and	21
gloom	21
is	21
spilt	21
over	21
his	21
heart,	21
as	21
if	21
nature	21
was	21
obliged	21
to	21
give	21
warning	21
of	21
coming	21
misfortunes	21
by	21
means	21
of	21
such	21
trivial	21
things	21
as	21
these.	21
The	21
wise	21
man	21
and	21
the	21
Christian	21
should	21
not	21
trifle	21
with	21
what	21
it	21
may	21
please	21
heaven	21
to	21
do.	21
Scipio	21
on	21
coming	21
to	21
Africa	21
stumbled	21
as	21
he	21
leaped	21
on	21
shore;	21
his	21
soldiers	21
took	21
it	21
as	21
a	21
bad	21
omen;	21
but	21
he,	21
clasping	21
the	21
soil	21
with	21
his	21
arms,	21
exclaimed,	21
‘Thou	21
canst	21
not	21
escape	21
me,	21
Africa,	21
for	21
I	21
hold	21
thee	21
tight	21
between	21
my	21
arms.’	21
Thus,	21
Sancho,	21
meeting	21
those	21
images	21
has	21
been	21
to	21
me	21
a	21
most	21
happy	21
occurrence.”	21
“I	21
can	21
well	21
believe	21
it,”	21
said	21
Sancho;	21
“but	21
I	21
wish	21
your	21
worship	21
would	21
tell	21
me	21
what	21
is	21
the	21
reason	21
that	21
the	21
Spaniards,	21
when	21
they	21
are	21
about	21
to	21
give	21
battle,	21
in	21
calling	21
on	21
that	21
Saint	21
James	21
the	21
Moorslayer,	21
say	21
‘Santiago	21
and	21
close	21
Spain!’	21
Is	21
Spain,	21
then,	21
open,	21
so	21
that	21
it	21
is	21
needful	21
to	21
close	21
it;	21
or	21
what	21
is	21
the	21
meaning	21
of	21
this	21
form?”	21
“Thou	21
art	21
very	21
simple,	21
Sancho,”	21
said	21
Don	21
Quixote;	21
“God,	21
look	21
you,	21
gave	21
that	21
great	21
knight	21
of	21
the	21
Red	21
Cross	21
to	21
Spain	21
as	21
her	21
patron	21
saint	21
and	21
protector,	21
especially	21
in	21
those	21
hard	21
struggles	21
the	21
Spaniards	21
had	21
with	21
the	21
Moors;	21
and	21
therefore	21
they	21
invoke	21
and	21
call	21
upon	21
him	21
as	21
their	21
defender	21
in	21
all	21
their	21
battles;	21
and	21
in	21
these	21
he	21
has	21
been	21
many	21
a	21
time	21
seen	21
beating	21
down,	21
trampling	21
under	21
foot,	21
destroying	21
and	21
slaughtering	21
the	21
Hagarene	21
squadrons	21
in	21
the	21
sight	21
of	21
all;	21
of	21
which	21
fact	21
I	21
could	21
give	21
thee	21
many	21
examples	21
recorded	21
in	21
truthful	21
Spanish	21
histories.”	21
Sancho	21
changed	21
the	21
subject,	21
and	21
said	21
to	21
his	21
master,	21
“I	21
marvel,	21
señor,	21
at	21
the	21
boldness	21
of	21
Altisidora,	21
the	21
duchess’s	21
handmaid;	21
he	21
whom	21
they	21
call	21
Love	21
must	21
have	21
cruelly	21
pierced	21
and	21
wounded	21
her;	21
they	21
say	21
he	21
is	21
a	21
little	21
blind	21
urchin	21
who,	21
though	21
blear-eyed,	21
or	21
more	21
properly	21
speaking	21
sightless,	21
if	21
he	21
aims	21
at	21
a	21
heart,	21
be	21
it	21
ever	21
so	21
small,	21
hits	21
it	21
and	21
pierces	21
it	21
through	21
and	21
through	21
with	21
his	21
arrows.	21
I	21
have	21
heard	21
it	21
said	21
too	21
that	21
the	21
arrows	21
of	21
Love	21
are	21
blunted	21
and	21
robbed	21
of	21
their	21
points	21
by	21
maidenly	21
modesty	21
and	21
reserve;	21
but	21
with	21
this	21
Altisidora	21
it	21
seems	21
they	21
are	21
sharpened	21
rather	21
than	21
blunted.”	21
“Bear	21
in	21
mind,	21
Sancho,”	21
said	21
Don	21
Quixote,	21
“that	21
love	21
is	21
influenced	21
by	21
no	21
consideration,	21
recognises	21
no	21
restraints	21
of	21
reason,	21
and	21
is	21
of	21
the	21
same	21
nature	21
as	21
death,	21
that	21
assails	21
alike	21
the	21
lofty	21
palaces	21
of	21
kings	21
and	21
the	21
humble	21
cabins	21
of	21
shepherds;	21
and	21
when	21
it	21
takes	21
entire	21
possession	21
of	21
a	21
heart,	21
the	21
first	21
thing	21
it	21
does	21
is	21
to	21
banish	21
fear	21
and	21
shame	21
from	21
it;	21
and	21
so	21
without	21
shame	21
Altisidora	21
declared	21
her	21
passion,	21
which	21
excited	21
in	21
my	21
mind	21
embarrassment	21
rather	21
than	21
commiseration.”	21
“Notable	21
cruelty!”	21
exclaimed	21
Sancho;	21
“unheard-of	21
ingratitude!	21
I	21
can	21
only	21
say	21
for	21
myself	21
that	21
the	21
very	21
smallest	21
loving	21
word	21
of	21
hers	21
would	21
have	21
subdued	21
me	21
and	21
made	21
a	21
slave	21
of	21
me.	21
The	21
devil!	21
What	21
a	21
heart	21
of	21
marble,	21
what	21
bowels	21
of	21
brass,	21
what	21
a	21
soul	21
of	21
mortar!	21
But	21
I	21
can’t	21
imagine	21
what	21
it	21
is	21
that	21
this	21
damsel	21
saw	21
in	21
your	21
worship	21
that	21
could	21
have	21
conquered	21
and	21
captivated	21
her	21
so.	21
What	21
gallant	21
figure	21
was	21
it,	21
what	21
bold	21
bearing,	21
what	21
sprightly	21
grace,	21
what	21
comeliness	21
of	21
feature,	21
which	21
of	21
these	21
things	21
by	21
itself,	21
or	21
what	21
all	21
together,	21
could	21
have	21
made	21
her	21
fall	21
in	21
love	21
with	21
you?	21
For	21
indeed	21
and	21
in	21
truth	21
many	21
a	21
time	21
I	21
stop	21
to	21
look	21
at	21
your	21
worship	21
from	21
the	21
sole	21
of	21
your	21
foot	21
to	21
the	21
topmost	21
hair	21
of	21
your	21
head,	21
and	21
I	21
see	21
more	21
to	21
frighten	21
one	21
than	21
to	21
make	21
one	21
fall	21
in	21
love;	21
moreover	21
I	21
have	21
heard	21
say	21
that	21
beauty	21
is	21
the	21
first	21
and	21
main	21
thing	21
that	21
excites	21
love,	21
and	21
as	21
your	21
worship	21
has	21
none	21
at	21
all,	21
I	21
don’t	21
know	21
what	21
the	21
poor	21
creature	21
fell	21
in	21
love	21
with.”	21
“Recollect,	21
Sancho,”	21
replied	21
Don	21
Quixote,	21
“there	21
are	21
two	21
sorts	21
of	21
beauty,	21
one	21
of	21
the	21
mind,	21
the	21
other	21
of	21
the	21
body;	21
that	21
of	21
the	21
mind	21
displays	21
and	21
exhibits	21
itself	21
in	21
intelligence,	21
in	21
modesty,	21
in	21
honourable	21
conduct,	21
in	21
generosity,	21
in	21
good	21
breeding;	21
and	21
all	21
these	21
qualities	21
are	21
possible	21
and	21
may	21
exist	21
in	21
an	21
ugly	21
man;	21
and	21
when	21
it	21
is	21
this	21
sort	21
of	21
beauty	21
and	21
not	21
that	21
of	21
the	21
body	21
that	21
is	21
the	21
attraction,	21
love	21
is	21
apt	21
to	21
spring	21
up	21
suddenly	21
and	21
violently.	21
I,	21
Sancho,	21
perceive	21
clearly	21
enough	21
that	21
I	21
am	21
not	21
beautiful,	21
but	21
at	21
the	21
same	21
time	21
I	21
know	21
I	21
am	21
not	21
hideous;	21
and	21
it	21
is	21
enough	21
for	21
an	21
honest	21
man	21
not	21
to	21
be	21
a	21
monster	21
to	21
be	21
an	21
object	21
of	21
love,	21
if	21
only	21
he	21
possesses	21
the	21
endowments	21
of	21
mind	21
I	21
have	21
mentioned.”	21
While	21
engaged	21
in	21
this	21
discourse	21
they	21
were	21
making	21
their	21
way	21
through	21
a	21
wood	21
that	21
lay	21
beyond	21
the	21
road,	21
when	21
suddenly,	21
without	21
expecting	21
anything	21
of	21
the	21
kind,	21
Don	21
Quixote	21
found	21
himself	21
caught	21
in	21
some	21
nets	21
of	21
green	21
cord	21
stretched	21
from	21
one	21
tree	21
to	21
another;	21
and	21
unable	21
to	21
conceive	21
what	21
it	21
could	21
be,	21
he	21
said	21
to	21
Sancho,	21
“Sancho,	21
it	21
strikes	21
me	21
this	21
affair	21
of	21
these	21
nets	21
will	21
prove	21
one	21
of	21
the	21
strangest	21
adventures	21
imaginable.	21
May	21
I	21
die	21
if	21
the	21
enchanters	21
that	21
persecute	21
me	21
are	21
not	21
trying	21
to	21
entangle	21
me	21
in	21
them	21
and	21
delay	21
my	21
journey,	21
by	21
way	21
of	21
revenge	21
for	21
my	21
obduracy	21
towards	21
Altisidora.	21
Well	21
then	21
let	21
me	21
tell	21
them	21
that	21
if	21
these	21
nets,	21
instead	21
of	21
being	21
green	21
cord,	21
were	21
made	21
of	21
the	21
hardest	21
diamonds,	21
or	21
stronger	21
than	21
that	21
wherewith	21
the	21
jealous	21
god	21
of	21
blacksmiths	21
enmeshed	21
Venus	21
and	21
Mars,	21
I	21
would	21
break	21
them	21
as	21
easily	21
as	21
if	21
they	21
were	21
made	21
of	21
rushes	21
or	21
cotton	21
threads.”	21
But	21
just	21
as	21
he	21
was	21
about	21
to	21
press	21
forward	21
and	21
break	21
through	21
all,	21
suddenly	21
from	21
among	21
some	21
trees	21
two	21
shepherdesses	21
of	21
surpassing	21
beauty	21
presented	21
themselves	21
to	21
his	21
sight—or	21
at	21
least	21
damsels	21
dressed	21
like	21
shepherdesses,	21
save	21
that	21
their	21
jerkins	21
and	21
sayas	21
were	21
of	21
fine	21
brocade;	21
that	21
is	21
to	21
say,	21
the	21
sayas	21
were	21
rich	21
farthingales	21
of	21
gold	21
embroidered	21
tabby.	21
Their	21
hair,	21
that	21
in	21
its	21
golden	21
brightness	21
vied	21
with	21
the	21
beams	21
of	21
the	21
sun	21
itself,	21
fell	21
loose	21
upon	21
their	21
shoulders	21
and	21
was	21
crowned	21
with	21
garlands	21
twined	21
with	21
green	21
laurel	21
and	21
red	21
everlasting;	21
and	21
their	21
years	21
to	21
all	21
appearance	21
were	21
not	21
under	21
fifteen	21
nor	21
above	21
eighteen.	21

Such	21
was	21
the	21
spectacle	21
that	21
filled	21
Sancho	21
with	21
amazement,	21
fascinated	21
Don	21
Quixote,	21
made	21
the	21
sun	21
halt	21
in	21
his	21
course	21
to	21
behold	21
them,	21
and	21
held	21
all	21
four	21
in	21
a	21
strange	21
silence.	21
One	21
of	21
the	21
shepherdesses,	21
at	21
length,	21
was	21
the	21
first	21
to	21
speak	21
and	21
said	21
to	21
Don	21
Quixote,	21
“Hold,	21
sir	21
knight,	21
and	21
do	21
not	21
break	21
these	21
nets;	21
for	21
they	21
are	21
not	21
spread	21
here	21
to	21
do	21
you	21
any	21
harm,	21
but	21
only	21
for	21
our	21
amusement;	21
and	21
as	21
I	21
know	21
you	21
will	21
ask	21
why	21
they	21
have	21
been	21
put	21
up,	21
and	21
who	21
we	21
are,	21
I	21
will	21
tell	21
you	21
in	21
a	21
few	21
words.	21
In	21
a	21
village	21
some	21
two	21
leagues	21
from	21
this,	21
where	21
there	21
are	21
many	21
people	21
of	21
quality	21
and	21
rich	21
gentlefolk,	21
it	21
was	21
agreed	21
upon	21
by	21
a	21
number	21
of	21
friends	21
and	21
relations	21
to	21
come	21
with	21
their	21
wives,	21
sons	21
and	21
daughters,	21
neighbours,	21
friends	21
and	21
kinsmen,	21
and	21
make	21
holiday	21
in	21
this	21
spot,	21
which	21
is	21
one	21
of	21
the	21
pleasantest	21
in	21
the	21
whole	21
neighbourhood,	21
setting	21
up	21
a	21
new	21
pastoral	21
Arcadia	21
among	21
ourselves,	21
we	21
maidens	21
dressing	21
ourselves	21
as	21
shepherdesses	21
and	21
the	21
youths	21
as	21
shepherds.	21
We	21
have	21
prepared	21
two	21
eclogues,	21
one	21
by	21
the	21
famous	21
poet	21
Garcilasso,	21
the	21
other	21
by	21
the	21
most	21
excellent	21
Camoens,	21
in	21
its	21
own	21
Portuguese	21
tongue,	21
but	21
we	21
have	21
not	21
as	21
yet	21
acted	21
them.	21
Yesterday	21
was	21
the	21
first	21
day	21
of	21
our	21
coming	21
here;	21
we	21
have	21
a	21
few	21
of	21
what	21
they	21
say	21
are	21
called	21
field-tents	21
pitched	21
among	21
the	21
trees	21
on	21
the	21
bank	21
of	21
an	21
ample	21
brook	21
that	21
fertilises	21
all	21
these	21
meadows;	21
last	21
night	21
we	21
spread	21
these	21
nets	21
in	21
the	21
trees	21
here	21
to	21
snare	21
the	21
silly	21
little	21
birds	21
that	21
startled	21
by	21
the	21
noise	21
we	21
make	21
may	21
fly	21
into	21
them.	21
If	21
you	21
please	21
to	21
be	21
our	21
guest,	21
señor,	21
you	21
will	21
be	21
welcomed	21
heartily	21
and	21
courteously,	21
for	21
here	21
just	21
now	21
neither	21
care	21
nor	21
sorrow	21
shall	21
enter.”	21
She	21
held	21
her	21
peace	21
and	21
said	21
no	21
more,	21
and	21
Don	21
Quixote	21
made	21
answer,	21
“Of	21
a	21
truth,	21
fairest	21
lady,	21
Actaeon	21
when	21
he	21
unexpectedly	21
beheld	21
Diana	21
bathing	21
in	21
the	21
stream	21
could	21
not	21
have	21
been	21
more	21
fascinated	21
and	21
wonderstruck	21
than	21
I	21
at	21
the	21
sight	21
of	21
your	21
beauty.	21
I	21
commend	21
your	21
mode	21
of	21
entertainment,	21
and	21
thank	21
you	21
for	21
the	21
kindness	21
of	21
your	21
invitation;	21
and	21
if	21
I	21
can	21
serve	21
you,	21
you	21
may	21
command	21
me	21
with	21
full	21
confidence	21
of	21
being	21
obeyed,	21
for	21
my	21
profession	21
is	21
none	21
other	21
than	21
to	21
show	21
myself	21
grateful,	21
and	21
ready	21
to	21
serve	21
persons	21
of	21
all	21
conditions,	21
but	21
especially	21
persons	21
of	21
quality	21
such	21
as	21
your	21
appearance	21
indicates;	21
and	21
if,	21
instead	21
of	21
taking	21
up,	21
as	21
they	21
probably	21
do,	21
but	21
a	21
small	21
space,	21
these	21
nets	21
took	21
up	21
the	21
whole	21
surface	21
of	21
the	21
globe,	21
I	21
would	21
seek	21
out	21
new	21
worlds	21
through	21
which	21
to	21
pass,	21
so	21
as	21
not	21
to	21
break	21
them;	21
and	21
that	21
ye	21
may	21
give	21
some	21
degree	21
of	21
credence	21
to	21
this	21
exaggerated	21
language	21
of	21
mine,	21
know	21
that	21
it	21
is	21
no	21
less	21
than	21
Don	21
Quixote	21
of	21
La	21
Mancha	21
that	21
makes	21
this	21
declaration	21
to	21
you,	21
if	21
indeed	21
it	21
be	21
that	21
such	21
a	21
name	21
has	21
reached	21
your	21
ears.”	21
“Ah!	21
friend	21
of	21
my	21
soul,”	21
instantly	21
exclaimed	21
the	21
other	21
shepherdess,	21
“what	21
great	21
good	21
fortune	21
has	21
befallen	21
us!	21
Seest	21
thou	21
this	21
gentleman	21
we	21
have	21
before	21
us?	21
Well	21
then	21
let	21
me	21
tell	21
thee	21
he	21
is	21
the	21
most	21
valiant	21
and	21
the	21
most	21
devoted	21
and	21
the	21
most	21
courteous	21
gentleman	21
in	21
all	21
the	21
world,	21
unless	21
a	21
history	21
of	21
his	21
achievements	21
that	21
has	21
been	21
printed	21
and	21
I	21
have	21
read	21
is	21
telling	21
lies	21
and	21
deceiving	21
us.	21
I	21
will	21
lay	21
a	21
wager	21
that	21
this	21
good	21
fellow	21
who	21
is	21
with	21
him	21
is	21
one	21
Sancho	21
Panza	21
his	21
squire,	21
whose	21
drolleries	21
none	21
can	21
equal.”	21
“That’s	21
true,”	21
said	21
Sancho;	21
“I	21
am	21
that	21
same	21
droll	21
and	21
squire	21
you	21
speak	21
of,	21
and	21
this	21
gentleman	21
is	21
my	21
master	21
Don	21
Quixote	21
of	21
La	21
Mancha,	21
the	21
same	21
that’s	21
in	21
the	21
history	21
and	21
that	21
they	21
talk	21
about.”	21
“Oh,	21
my	21
friend,”	21
said	21
the	21
other,	21
“let	21
us	21
entreat	21
him	21
to	21
stay;	21
for	21
it	21
will	21
give	21
our	21
fathers	21
and	21
brothers	21
infinite	21
pleasure;	21
I	21
too	21
have	21
heard	21
just	21
what	21
thou	21
hast	21
told	21
me	21
of	21
the	21
valour	21
of	21
the	21
one	21
and	21
the	21
drolleries	21
of	21
the	21
other;	21
and	21
what	21
is	21
more,	21
of	21
him	21
they	21
say	21
that	21
he	21
is	21
the	21
most	21
constant	21
and	21
loyal	21
lover	21
that	21
was	21
ever	21
heard	21
of,	21
and	21
that	21
his	21
lady	21
is	21
one	21
Dulcinea	21
del	21
Toboso,	21
to	21
whom	21
all	21
over	21
Spain	21
the	21
palm	21
of	21
beauty	21
is	21
awarded.”	21
“And	21
justly	21
awarded,”	21
said	21
Don	21
Quixote,	21
“unless,	21
indeed,	21
your	21
unequalled	21
beauty	21
makes	21
it	21
a	21
matter	21
of	21
doubt.	21
But	21
spare	21
yourselves	21
the	21
trouble,	21
ladies,	21
of	21
pressing	21
me	21
to	21
stay,	21
for	21
the	21
urgent	21
calls	21
of	21
my	21
profession	21
do	21
not	21
allow	21
me	21
to	21
take	21
rest	21
under	21
any	21
circumstances.”	21
At	21
this	21
instant	21
there	21
came	21
up	21
to	21
the	21
spot	21
where	21
the	21
four	21
stood	21
a	21
brother	21
of	21
one	21
of	21
the	21
two	21
shepherdesses,	21
like	21
them	21
in	21
shepherd	21
costume,	21
and	21
as	21
richly	21
and	21
gaily	21
dressed	21
as	21
they	21
were.	21
They	21
told	21
him	21
that	21
their	21
companion	21
was	21
the	21
valiant	21
Don	21
Quixote	21
of	21
La	21
Mancha,	21
and	21
the	21
other	21
Sancho	21
his	21
squire,	21
of	21
whom	21
he	21
knew	21
already	21
from	21
having	21
read	21
their	21
history.	21
The	21
gay	21
shepherd	21
offered	21
him	21
his	21
services	21
and	21
begged	21
that	21
he	21
would	21
accompany	21
him	21
to	21
their	21
tents,	21
and	21
Don	21
Quixote	21
had	21
to	21
give	21
way	21
and	21
comply.	21
And	21
now	21
the	21
game	21
was	21
started,	21
and	21
the	21
nets	21
were	21
filled	21
with	21
a	21
variety	21
of	21
birds	21
that	21
deceived	21
by	21
the	21
colour	21
fell	21
into	21
the	21
danger	21
they	21
were	21
flying	21
from.	21
Upwards	21
of	21
thirty	21
persons,	21
all	21
gaily	21
attired	21
as	21
shepherds	21
and	21
shepherdesses,	21
assembled	21
on	21
the	21
spot,	21
and	21
were	21
at	21
once	21
informed	21
who	21
Don	21
Quixote	21
and	21
his	21
squire	21
were,	21
whereat	21
they	21
were	21
not	21
a	21
little	21
delighted,	21
as	21
they	21
knew	21
of	21
him	21
already	21
through	21
his	21
history.	21
They	21
repaired	21
to	21
the	21
tents,	21
where	21
they	21
found	21
tables	21
laid	21
out,	21
and	21
choicely,	21
plentifully,	21
and	21
neatly	21
furnished.	21
They	21
treated	21
Don	21
Quixote	21
as	21
a	21
person	21
of	21
distinction,	21
giving	21
him	21
the	21
place	21
of	21
honour,	21
and	21
all	21
observed	21
him,	21
and	21
were	21
full	21
of	21
astonishment	21
at	21
the	21
spectacle.	21
At	21
last	21
the	21
cloth	21
being	21
removed,	21
Don	21
Quixote	21
with	21
great	21
composure	21
lifted	21
up	21
his	21
voice	21
and	21
said:	21
“One	21
of	21
the	21
greatest	21
sins	21
that	21
men	21
are	21
guilty	21
of	21
is—some	21
will	21
say	21
pride—but	21
I	21
say	21
ingratitude,	21
going	21
by	21
the	21
common	21
saying	21
that	21
hell	21
is	21
full	21
of	21
ingrates.	21
This	21
sin,	21
so	21
far	21
as	21
it	21
has	21
lain	21
in	21
my	21
power,	21
I	21
have	21
endeavoured	21
to	21
avoid	21
ever	21
since	21
I	21
have	21
enjoyed	21
the	21
faculty	21
of	21
reason;	21
and	21
if	21
I	21
am	21
unable	21
to	21
requite	21
good	21
deeds	21
that	21
have	21
been	21
done	21
me	21
by	21
other	21
deeds,	21
I	21
substitute	21
the	21
desire	21
to	21
do	21
so;	21
and	21
if	21
that	21
be	21
not	21
enough	21
I	21
make	21
them	21
known	21
publicly;	21
for	21
he	21
who	21
declares	21
and	21
makes	21
known	21
the	21
good	21
deeds	21
done	21
to	21
him	21
would	21
repay	21
them	21
by	21
others	21
if	21
it	21
were	21
in	21
his	21
power,	21
and	21
for	21
the	21
most	21
part	21
those	21
who	21
receive	21
are	21
the	21
inferiors	21
of	21
those	21
who	21
give.	21
Thus,	21
God	21
is	21
superior	21
to	21
all	21
because	21
he	21
is	21
the	21
supreme	21
giver,	21
and	21
the	21
offerings	21
of	21
man	21
fall	21
short	21
by	21
an	21
infinite	21
distance	21
of	21
being	21
a	21
full	21
return	21
for	21
the	21
gifts	21
of	21
God;	21
but	21
gratitude	21
in	21
some	21
degree	21
makes	21
up	21
for	21
this	21
deficiency	21
and	21
shortcoming.	21
I	21
therefore,	21
grateful	21
for	21
the	21
favour	21
that	21
has	21
been	21
extended	21
to	21
me	21
here,	21
and	21
unable	21
to	21
make	21
a	21
return	21
in	21
the	21
same	21
measure,	21
restricted	21
as	21
I	21
am	21
by	21
the	21
narrow	21
limits	21
of	21
my	21
power,	21
offer	21
what	21
I	21
can	21
and	21
what	21
I	21
have	21
to	21
offer	21
in	21
my	21
own	21
way;	21
and	21
so	21
I	21
declare	21
that	21
for	21
two	21
full	21
days	21
I	21
will	21
maintain	21
in	21
the	21
middle	21
of	21
this	21
highway	21
leading	21
to	21
Saragossa,	21
that	21
these	21
ladies	21
disguised	21
as	21
shepherdesses,	21
who	21
are	21
here	21
present,	21
are	21
the	21
fairest	21
and	21
most	21
courteous	21
maidens	21
in	21
the	21
world,	21
excepting	21
only	21
the	21
peerless	21
Dulcinea	21
del	21
Toboso,	21
sole	21
mistress	21
of	21
my	21
thoughts,	21
be	21
it	21
said	21
without	21
offence	21
to	21
those	21
who	21
hear	21
me,	21
ladies	21
and	21
gentlemen.”	21
On	21
hearing	21
this	21
Sancho,	21
who	21
had	21
been	21
listening	21
with	21
great	21
attention,	21
cried	21
out	21
in	21
a	21
loud	21
voice,	21
“Is	21
it	21
possible	21
there	21
is	21
anyone	21
in	21
the	21
world	21
who	21
will	21
dare	21
to	21
say	21
and	21
swear	21
that	21
this	21
master	21
of	21
mine	21
is	21
a	21
madman?	21
Say,	21
gentlemen	21
shepherds,	21
is	21
there	21
a	21
village	21
priest,	21
be	21
he	21
ever	21
so	21
wise	21
or	21
learned,	21
who	21
could	21
say	21
what	21
my	21
master	21
has	21
said;	21
or	21
is	21
there	21
knight-errant,	21
whatever	21
renown	21
he	21
may	21
have	21
as	21
a	21
man	21
of	21
valour,	21
that	21
could	21
offer	21
what	21
my	21
master	21
has	21
offered	21
now?”	21
Don	21
Quixote	21
turned	21
upon	21
Sancho,	21
and	21
with	21
a	21
countenance	21
glowing	21
with	21
anger	21
said	21
to	21
him,	21
“Is	21
it	21
possible,	21
Sancho,	21
there	21
is	21
anyone	21
in	21
the	21
whole	21
world	21
who	21
will	21
say	21
thou	21
art	21
not	21
a	21
fool,	21
with	21
a	21
lining	21
to	21
match,	21
and	21
I	21
know	21
not	21
what	21
trimmings	21
of	21
impertinence	21
and	21
roguery?	21
Who	21
asked	21
thee	21
to	21
meddle	21
in	21
my	21
affairs,	21
or	21
to	21
inquire	21
whether	21
I	21
am	21
a	21
wise	21
man	21
or	21
a	21
blockhead?	21
Hold	21
thy	21
peace;	21
answer	21
me	21
not	21
a	21
word;	21
saddle	21
Rocinante	21
if	21
he	21
be	21
unsaddled;	21
and	21
let	21
us	21
go	21
to	21
put	21
my	21
offer	21
into	21
execution;	21
for	21
with	21
the	21
right	21
that	21
I	21
have	21
on	21
my	21
side	21
thou	21
mayest	21
reckon	21
as	21
vanquished	21
all	21
who	21
shall	21
venture	21
to	21
question	21
it;”	21
and	21
in	21
a	21
great	21
rage,	21
and	21
showing	21
his	21
anger	21
plainly,	21
he	21
rose	21
from	21
his	21
seat,	21
leaving	21
the	21
company	21
lost	21
in	21
wonder,	21
and	21
making	21
them	21
feel	21
doubtful	21
whether	21
they	21
ought	21
to	21
regard	21
him	21
as	21
a	21
madman	21
or	21
a	21
rational	21
being.	21
In	21
the	21
end,	21
though	21
they	21
sought	21
to	21
dissuade	21
him	21
from	21
involving	21
himself	21
in	21
such	21
a	21
challenge,	21
assuring	21
him	21
they	21
admitted	21
his	21
gratitude	21
as	21
fully	21
established,	21
and	21
needed	21
no	21
fresh	21
proofs	21
to	21
be	21
convinced	21
of	21
his	21
valiant	21
spirit,	21
as	21
those	21
related	21
in	21
the	21
history	21
of	21
his	21
exploits	21
were	21
sufficient,	21
still	21
Don	21
Quixote	21
persisted	21
in	21
his	21
resolve;	21
and	21
mounted	21
on	21
Rocinante,	21
bracing	21
his	21
buckler	21
on	21
his	21
arm	21
and	21
grasping	21
his	21
lance,	21
he	21
posted	21
himself	21
in	21
the	21
middle	21
of	21
a	21
high	21
road	21
that	21
was	21
not	21
far	21
from	21
the	21
green	21
meadow.	21
Sancho	21
followed	21
on	21
Dapple,	21
together	21
with	21
all	21
the	21
members	21
of	21
the	21
pastoral	21
gathering,	21
eager	21
to	21
see	21
what	21
would	21
be	21
the	21
upshot	21
of	21
his	21
vainglorious	21
and	21
extraordinary	21
proposal.	21
Don	21
Quixote,	21
then,	21
having,	21
as	21
has	21
been	21
said,	21
planted	21
himself	21
in	21
the	21
middle	21
of	21
the	21
road,	21
made	21
the	21
welkin	21
ring	21
with	21
words	21
to	21
this	21
effect:	21
“Ho	21
ye	21
travellers	21
and	21
wayfarers,	21
knights,	21
squires,	21
folk	21
on	21
foot	21
or	21
on	21
horseback,	21
who	21
pass	21
this	21
way	21
or	21
shall	21
pass	21
in	21
the	21
course	21
of	21
the	21
next	21
two	21
days!	21
Know	21
that	21
Don	21
Quixote	21
of	21
La	21
Mancha,	21
knight-errant,	21
is	21
posted	21
here	21
to	21
maintain	21
by	21
arms	21
that	21
the	21
beauty	21
and	21
courtesy	21
enshrined	21
in	21
the	21
nymphs	21
that	21
dwell	21
in	21
these	21
meadows	21
and	21
groves	21
surpass	21
all	21
upon	21
earth,	21
putting	21
aside	21
the	21
lady	21
of	21
my	21
heart,	21
Dulcinea	21
del	21
Toboso.	21
Wherefore,	21
let	21
him	21
who	21
is	21
of	21
the	21
opposite	21
opinion	21
come	21
on,	21
for	21
here	21
I	21
await	21
him.”	21
Twice	21
he	21
repeated	21
the	21
same	21
words,	21
and	21
twice	21
they	21
fell	21
unheard	21
by	21
any	21
adventurer;	21
but	21
fate,	21
that	21
was	21
guiding	21
affairs	21
for	21
him	21
from	21
better	21
to	21
better,	21
so	21
ordered	21
it	21
that	21
shortly	21
afterwards	21
there	21
appeared	21
on	21
the	21
road	21
a	21
crowd	21
of	21
men	21
on	21
horseback,	21
many	21
of	21
them	21
with	21
lances	21
in	21
their	21
hands,	21
all	21
riding	21
in	21
a	21
compact	21
body	21
and	21
in	21
great	21
haste.	21
No	21
sooner	21
had	21
those	21
who	21
were	21
with	21
Don	21
Quixote	21
seen	21
them	21
than	21
they	21
turned	21
about	21
and	21
withdrew	21
to	21
some	21
distance	21
from	21
the	21
road,	21
for	21
they	21
knew	21
that	21
if	21
they	21
stayed	21
some	21
harm	21
might	21
come	21
to	21
them;	21
but	21
Don	21
Quixote	21
with	21
intrepid	21
heart	21
stood	21
his	21
ground,	21
and	21
Sancho	21
Panza	21
shielded	21
himself	21
with	21
Rocinante’s	21
hind-quarters.	21
The	21
troop	21
of	21
lancers	21
came	21
up,	21
and	21
one	21
of	21
them	21
who	21
was	21
in	21
advance	21
began	21
shouting	21
to	21
Don	21
Quixote,	21
“Get	21
out	21
of	21
the	21
way,	21
you	21
son	21
of	21
the	21
devil,	21
or	21
these	21
bulls	21
will	21
knock	21
you	21
to	21
pieces!”	21
“Rabble!”	21
returned	21
Don	21
Quixote,	21
“I	21
care	21
nothing	21
for	21
bulls,	21
be	21
they	21
the	21
fiercest	21
Jarama	21
breeds	21
on	21
its	21
banks.	21
Confess	21
at	21
once,	21
scoundrels,	21
that	21
what	21
I	21
have	21
declared	21
is	21
true;	21
else	21
ye	21
have	21
to	21
deal	21
with	21
me	21
in	21
combat.”	21
The	21
herdsman	21
had	21
no	21
time	21
to	21
reply,	21
nor	21
Don	21
Quixote	21
to	21
get	21
out	21
of	21
the	21
way	21
even	21
if	21
he	21
wished;	21
and	21
so	21
the	21
drove	21
of	21
fierce	21
bulls	21
and	21
tame	21
bullocks,	21
together	21
with	21
the	21
crowd	21
of	21
herdsmen	21
and	21
others	21
who	21
were	21
taking	21
them	21
to	21
be	21
penned	21
up	21
in	21
a	21
village	21
where	21
they	21
were	21
to	21
be	21
run	21
the	21
next	21
day,	21
passed	21
over	21
Don	21
Quixote	21
and	21
over	21
Sancho,	21
Rocinante	21
and	21
Dapple,	21
hurling	21
them	21
all	21
to	21
the	21
earth	21
and	21
rolling	21
them	21
over	21
on	21
the	21
ground.	21
Sancho	21
was	21
left	21
crushed,	21
Don	21
Quixote	21
scared,	21
Dapple	21
belaboured	21
and	21
Rocinante	21
in	21
no	21
very	21
sound	21
condition.	21

They	21
all	21
got	21
up,	21
however,	21
at	21
length,	21
and	21
Don	21
Quixote	21
in	21
great	21
haste,	21
stumbling	21
here	21
and	21
falling	21
there,	21
started	21
off	21
running	21
after	21
the	21
drove,	21
shouting	21
out,	21
“Hold!	21
stay!	21
ye	21
rascally	21
rabble,	21
a	21
single	21
knight	21
awaits	21
you,	21
and	21
he	21
is	21
not	21
of	21
the	21
temper	21
or	21
opinion	21
of	21
those	21
who	21
say,	21
‘For	21
a	21
flying	21
enemy	21
make	21
a	21
bridge	21
of	21
silver.’”	21
The	21
retreating	21
party	21
in	21
their	21
haste,	21
however,	21
did	21
not	21
stop	21
for	21
that,	21
or	21
heed	21
his	21
menaces	21
any	21
more	21
than	21
last	21
year’s	21
clouds.	21
Weariness	21
brought	21
Don	21
Quixote	21
to	21
a	21
halt,	21
and	21
more	21
enraged	21
than	21
avenged	21
he	21
sat	21
down	21
on	21
the	21
road	21
to	21
wait	21
until	21
Sancho,	21
Rocinante	21
and	21
Dapple	21
came	21
up.	21
When	21
they	21
reached	21
him	21
master	21
and	21
man	21
mounted	21
once	21
more,	21
and	21
without	21
going	21
back	21
to	21
bid	21
farewell	21
to	21
the	21
mock	21
or	21
imitation	21
Arcadia,	21
and	21
more	21
in	21
humiliation	21
than	21
contentment,	21
they	21
continued	21
their	21
journey.	21

A	21
clear	21
limpid	21
spring	21
which	21
they	21
discovered	21
in	21
a	21
cool	21
grove	21
relieved	21
Don	21
Quixote	21
and	21
Sancho	21
of	21
the	21
dust	21
and	21
fatigue	21
due	21
to	21
the	21
unpolite	21
behaviour	21
of	21
the	21
bulls,	21
and	21
by	21
the	21
side	21
of	21
this,	21
having	21
turned	21
Dapple	21
and	21
Rocinante	21
loose	21
without	21
headstall	21
or	21
bridle,	21
the	21
forlorn	21
pair,	21
master	21
and	21
man,	21
seated	21
themselves.	21
Sancho	21
had	21
recourse	21
to	21
the	21
larder	21
of	21
his	21
alforjas	21
and	21
took	21
out	21
of	21
them	21
what	21
he	21
called	21
the	21
prog;	21
Don	21
Quixote	21
rinsed	21
his	21
mouth	21
and	21
bathed	21
his	21
face,	21
by	21
which	21
cooling	21
process	21
his	21
flagging	21
energies	21
were	21
revived.	21
Out	21
of	21
pure	21
vexation	21
he	21
remained	21
without	21
eating,	21
and	21
out	21
of	21
pure	21
politeness	21
Sancho	21
did	21
not	21
venture	21
to	21
touch	21
a	21
morsel	21
of	21
what	21
was	21
before	21
him,	21
but	21
waited	21
for	21
his	21
master	21
to	21
act	21
as	21
taster.	21
Seeing,	21
however,	21
that,	21
absorbed	21
in	21
thought,	21
he	21
was	21
forgetting	21
to	21
carry	21
the	21
bread	21
to	21
his	21
mouth,	21
he	21
said	21
never	21
a	21
word,	21
and	21
trampling	21
every	21
sort	21
of	21
good	21
breeding	21
under	21
foot,	21
began	21
to	21
stow	21
away	21
in	21
his	21
paunch	21
the	21
bread	21
and	21
cheese	21
that	21
came	21
to	21
his	21
hand.	21

“Eat,	21
Sancho	21
my	21
friend,”	21
said	21
Don	21
Quixote;	21
“support	21
life,	21
which	21
is	21
of	21
more	21
consequence	21
to	21
thee	21
than	21
to	21
me,	21
and	21
leave	21
me	21
to	21
die	21
under	21
the	21
pain	21
of	21
my	21
thoughts	21
and	21
pressure	21
of	21
my	21
misfortunes.	21
I	21
was	21
born,	21
Sancho,	21
to	21
live	21
dying,	21
and	21
thou	21
to	21
die	21
eating;	21
and	21
to	21
prove	21
the	21
truth	21
of	21
what	21
I	21
say,	21
look	21
at	21
me,	21
printed	21
in	21
histories,	21
famed	21
in	21
arms,	21
courteous	21
in	21
behaviour,	21
honoured	21
by	21
princes,	21
courted	21
by	21
maidens;	21
and	21
after	21
all,	21
when	21
I	21
looked	21
forward	21
to	21
palms,	21
triumphs,	21
and	21
crowns,	21
won	21
and	21
earned	21
by	21
my	21
valiant	21
deeds,	21
I	21
have	21
this	21
morning	21
seen	21
myself	21
trampled	21
on,	21
kicked,	21
and	21
crushed	21
by	21
the	21
feet	21
of	21
unclean	21
and	21
filthy	21
animals.	21
This	21
thought	21
blunts	21
my	21
teeth,	21
paralyses	21
my	21
jaws,	21
cramps	21
my	21
hands,	21
and	21
robs	21
me	21
of	21
all	21
appetite	21
for	21
food;	21
so	21
much	21
so	21
that	21
I	21
have	21
a	21
mind	21
to	21
let	21
myself	21
die	21
of	21
hunger,	21
the	21
cruelest	21
death	21
of	21
all	21
deaths.”	21
“So	21
then,”	21
said	21
Sancho,	21
munching	21
hard	21
all	21
the	21
time,	21
“your	21
worship	21
does	21
not	21
agree	21
with	21
the	21
proverb	21
that	21
says,	21
‘Let	21
Martha	21
die,	21
but	21
let	21
her	21
die	21
with	21
a	21
full	21
belly.’	21
I,	21
at	21
any	21
rate,	21
have	21
no	21
mind	21
to	21
kill	21
myself;	21
so	21
far	21
from	21
that,	21
I	21
mean	21
to	21
do	21
as	21
the	21
cobbler	21
does,	21
who	21
stretches	21
the	21
leather	21
with	21
his	21
teeth	21
until	21
he	21
makes	21
it	21
reach	21
as	21
far	21
as	21
he	21
wants.	21
I’ll	21
stretch	21
out	21
my	21
life	21
by	21
eating	21
until	21
it	21
reaches	21
the	21
end	21
heaven	21
has	21
fixed	21
for	21
it;	21
and	21
let	21
me	21
tell	21
you,	21
señor,	21
there’s	21
no	21
greater	21
folly	21
than	21
to	21
think	21
of	21
dying	21
of	21
despair	21
as	21
your	21
worship	21
does;	21
take	21
my	21
advice,	21
and	21
after	21
eating	21
lie	21
down	21
and	21
sleep	21
a	21
bit	21
on	21
this	21
green	21
grass-mattress,	21
and	21
you	21
will	21
see	21
that	21
when	21
you	21
awake	21
you’ll	21
feel	21
something	21
better.”	21
Don	21
Quixote	21
did	21
as	21
he	21
recommended,	21
for	21
it	21
struck	21
him	21
that	21
Sancho’s	21
reasoning	21
was	21
more	21
like	21
a	21
philosopher’s	21
than	21
a	21
blockhead’s,	21
and	21
said	21
he,	21
“Sancho,	21
if	21
thou	21
wilt	21
do	21
for	21
me	21
what	21
I	21
am	21
going	21
to	21
tell	21
thee	21
my	21
ease	21
of	21
mind	21
would	21
be	21
more	21
assured	21
and	21
my	21
heaviness	21
of	21
heart	21
not	21
so	21
great;	21
and	21
it	21
is	21
this;	21
to	21
go	21
aside	21
a	21
little	21
while	21
I	21
am	21
sleeping	21
in	21
accordance	21
with	21
thy	21
advice,	21
and,	21
making	21
bare	21
thy	21
carcase	21
to	21
the	21
air,	21
to	21
give	21
thyself	21
three	21
or	21
four	21
hundred	21
lashes	21
with	21
Rocinante’s	21
reins,	21
on	21
account	21
of	21
the	21
three	21
thousand	21
and	21
odd	21
thou	21
art	21
to	21
give	21
thyself	21
for	21
the	21
disenchantment	21
of	21
Dulcinea;	21
for	21
it	21
is	21
a	21
great	21
pity	21
that	21
the	21
poor	21
lady	21
should	21
be	21
left	21
enchanted	21
through	21
thy	21
carelessness	21
and	21
negligence.”	21
“There	21
is	21
a	21
good	21
deal	21
to	21
be	21
said	21
on	21
that	21
point,”	21
said	21
Sancho;	21
“let	21
us	21
both	21
go	21
to	21
sleep	21
now,	21
and	21
after	21
that,	21
God	21
has	21
decreed	21
what	21
will	21
happen.	21
Let	21
me	21
tell	21
your	21
worship	21
that	21
for	21
a	21
man	21
to	21
whip	21
himself	21
in	21
cold	21
blood	21
is	21
a	21
hard	21
thing,	21
especially	21
if	21
the	21
stripes	21
fall	21
upon	21
an	21
ill-nourished	21
and	21
worse-fed	21
body.	21
Let	21
my	21
lady	21
Dulcinea	21
have	21
patience,	21
and	21
when	21
she	21
is	21
least	21
expecting	21
it,	21
she	21
will	21
see	21
me	21
made	21
a	21
riddle	21
of	21
with	21
whipping,	21
and	21
‘until	21
death	21
it’s	21
all	21
life;’	21
I	21
mean	21
that	21
I	21
have	21
still	21
life	21
in	21
me,	21
and	21
the	21
desire	21
to	21
make	21
good	21
what	21
I	21
have	21
promised.”	21
Don	21
Quixote	21
thanked	21
him,	21
and	21
ate	21
a	21
little,	21
and	21
Sancho	21
a	21
good	21
deal,	21
and	21
then	21
they	21
both	21
lay	21
down	21
to	21
sleep,	21
leaving	21
those	21
two	21
inseparable	21
friends	21
and	21
comrades,	21
Rocinante	21
and	21
Dapple,	21
to	21
their	21
own	21
devices	21
and	21
to	21
feed	21
unrestrained	21
upon	21
the	21
abundant	21
grass	21
with	21
which	21
the	21
meadow	21
was	21
furnished.	21
They	21
woke	21
up	21
rather	21
late,	21
mounted	21
once	21
more	21
and	21
resumed	21
their	21
journey,	21
pushing	21
on	21
to	21
reach	21
an	21
inn	21
which	21
was	21
in	21
sight,	21
apparently	21
a	21
league	21
off.	21
I	21
say	21
an	21
inn,	21
because	21
Don	21
Quixote	21
called	21
it	21
so,	21
contrary	21
to	21
his	21
usual	21
practice	21
of	21
calling	21
all	21
inns	21
castles.	21
They	21
reached	21
it,	21
and	21
asked	21
the	21
landlord	21
if	21
they	21
could	21
put	21
up	21
there.	21
He	21
said	21
yes,	21
with	21
as	21
much	21
comfort	21
and	21
as	21
good	21
fare	21
as	21
they	21
could	21
find	21
in	21
Saragossa.	21
They	21
dismounted,	21
and	21
Sancho	21
stowed	21
away	21
his	21
larder	21
in	21
a	21
room	21
of	21
which	21
the	21
landlord	21
gave	21
him	21
the	21
key.	21
He	21
took	21
the	21
beasts	21
to	21
the	21
stable,	21
fed	21
them,	21
and	21
came	21
back	21
to	21
see	21
what	21
orders	21
Don	21
Quixote,	21
who	21
was	21
seated	21
on	21
a	21
bench	21
at	21
the	21
door,	21
had	21
for	21
him,	21
giving	21
special	21
thanks	21
to	21
heaven	21
that	21
this	21
inn	21
had	21
not	21
been	21
taken	21
for	21
a	21
castle	21
by	21
his	21
master.	21
Supper-time	21
came,	21
and	21
they	21
repaired	21
to	21
their	21
room,	21
and	21
Sancho	21
asked	21
the	21
landlord	21
what	21
he	21
had	21
to	21
give	21
them	21
for	21
supper.	21
To	21
this	21
the	21
landlord	21
replied	21
that	21
his	21
mouth	21
should	21
be	21
the	21
measure;	21
he	21
had	21
only	21
to	21
ask	21
what	21
he	21
would;	21
for	21
that	21
inn	21
was	21
provided	21
with	21
the	21
birds	21
of	21
the	21
air	21
and	21
the	21
fowls	21
of	21
the	21
earth	21
and	21
the	21
fish	21
of	21
the	21
sea.	21
“There’s	21
no	21
need	21
of	21
all	21
that,”	21
said	21
Sancho;	21
“if	21
they’ll	21
roast	21
us	21
a	21
couple	21
of	21
chickens	21
we’ll	21
be	21
satisfied,	21
for	21
my	21
master	21
is	21
delicate	21
and	21
eats	21
little,	21
and	21
I’m	21
not	21
over	21
and	21
above	21
gluttonous.”	21
The	21
landlord	21
replied	21
he	21
had	21
no	21
chickens,	21
for	21
the	21
kites	21
had	21
stolen	21
them.	21
“Well	21
then,”	21
said	21
Sancho,	21
“let	21
señor	21
landlord	21
tell	21
them	21
to	21
roast	21
a	21
pullet,	21
so	21
that	21
it	21
is	21
a	21
tender	21
one.”	21
“Pullet!	21
My	21
father!”	21
said	21
the	21
landlord;	21
“indeed	21
and	21
in	21
truth	21
it’s	21
only	21
yesterday	21
I	21
sent	21
over	21
fifty	21
to	21
the	21
city	21
to	21
sell;	21
but	21
saving	21
pullets	21
ask	21
what	21
you	21
will.”	21
“In	21
that	21
case,”	21
said	21
Sancho,	21
“you	21
will	21
not	21
be	21
without	21
veal	21
or	21
kid.”	21
“Just	21
now,”	21
said	21
the	21
landlord,	21
“there’s	21
none	21
in	21
the	21
house,	21
for	21
it’s	21
all	21
finished;	21
but	21
next	21
week	21
there	21
will	21
be	21
enough	21
and	21
to	21
spare.”	21
“Much	21
good	21
that	21
does	21
us,”	21
said	21
Sancho;	21
“I’ll	21
lay	21
a	21
bet	21
that	21
all	21
these	21
short-comings	21
are	21
going	21
to	21
wind	21
up	21
in	21
plenty	21
of	21
bacon	21
and	21
eggs.”	21
“By	21
God,”	21
said	21
the	21
landlord,	21
“my	21
guest’s	21
wits	21
must	21
be	21
precious	21
dull;	21
I	21
tell	21
him	21
I	21
have	21
neither	21
pullets	21
nor	21
hens,	21
and	21
he	21
wants	21
me	21
to	21
have	21
eggs!	21
Talk	21
of	21
other	21
dainties,	21
if	21
you	21
please,	21
and	21
don’t	21
ask	21
for	21
hens	21
again.”	21
“Body	21
o’	21
me!”	21
said	21
Sancho,	21
“let’s	21
settle	21
the	21
matter;	21
say	21
at	21
once	21
what	21
you	21
have	21
got,	21
and	21
let	21
us	21
have	21
no	21
more	21
words	21
about	21
it.”	21
“In	21
truth	21
and	21
earnest,	21
señor	21
guest,”	21
said	21
the	21
landlord,	21
“all	21
I	21
have	21
is	21
a	21
couple	21
of	21
cow-heels	21
like	21
calves’	21
feet,	21
or	21
a	21
couple	21
of	21
calves’	21
feet	21
like	21
cowheels;	21
they	21
are	21
boiled	21
with	21
chick-peas,	21
onions,	21
and	21
bacon,	21
and	21
at	21
this	21
moment	21
they	21
are	21
crying	21
‘Come	21
eat	21
me,	21
come	21
eat	21
me.”	21
“I	21
mark	21
them	21
for	21
mine	21
on	21
the	21
spot,”	21
said	21
Sancho;	21
“let	21
nobody	21
touch	21
them;	21
I’ll	21
pay	21
better	21
for	21
them	21
than	21
anyone	21
else,	21
for	21
I	21
could	21
not	21
wish	21
for	21
anything	21
more	21
to	21
my	21
taste;	21
and	21
I	21
don’t	21
care	21
a	21
pin	21
whether	21
they	21
are	21
feet	21
or	21
heels.”	21
“Nobody	21
shall	21
touch	21
them,”	21
said	21
the	21
landlord;	21
“for	21
the	21
other	21
guests	21
I	21
have,	21
being	21
persons	21
of	21
high	21
quality,	21
bring	21
their	21
own	21
cook	21
and	21
caterer	21
and	21
larder	21
with	21
them.”	21
“If	21
you	21
come	21
to	21
people	21
of	21
quality,”	21
said	21
Sancho,	21
“there’s	21
nobody	21
more	21
so	21
than	21
my	21
master;	21
but	21
the	21
calling	21
he	21
follows	21
does	21
not	21
allow	21
of	21
larders	21
or	21
store-rooms;	21
we	21
lay	21
ourselves	21
down	21
in	21
the	21
middle	21
of	21
a	21
meadow,	21
and	21
fill	21
ourselves	21
with	21
acorns	21
or	21
medlars.”	21
Here	21
ended	21
Sancho’s	21
conversation	21
with	21
the	21
landlord,	21
Sancho	21
not	21
caring	21
to	21
carry	21
it	21
any	21
farther	21
by	21
answering	21
him;	21
for	21
he	21
had	21
already	21
asked	21
him	21
what	21
calling	21
or	21
what	21
profession	21
it	21
was	21
his	21
master	21
was	21
of.	21
Supper-time	21
having	21
come,	21
then,	21
Don	21
Quixote	21
betook	21
himself	21
to	21
his	21
room,	21
the	21
landlord	21
brought	21
in	21
the	21
stew-pan	21
just	21
as	21
it	21
was,	21
and	21
he	21
sat	21
himself	21
down	21
to	21
sup	21
very	21
resolutely.	21
It	21
seems	21
that	21
in	21
another	21
room,	21
which	21
was	21
next	21
to	21
Don	21
Quixote’s,	21
with	21
nothing	21
but	21
a	21
thin	21
partition	21
to	21
separate	21
it,	21
he	21
overheard	21
these	21
words,	21
“As	21
you	21
live,	21
Señor	21
Don	21
Jeronimo,	21
while	21
they	21
are	21
bringing	21
supper,	21
let	21
us	21
read	21
another	21
chapter	21
of	21
the	21
Second	21
Part	21
of	21
‘Don	21
Quixote	21
of	21
La	21
Mancha.’”	21
The	21
instant	21
Don	21
Quixote	21
heard	21
his	21
own	21
name	21
he	21
started	21
to	21
his	21
feet	21
and	21
listened	21
with	21
open	21
ears	21
to	21
catch	21
what	21
they	21
said	21
about	21
him,	21
and	21
heard	21
the	21
Don	21
Jeronimo	21
who	21
had	21
been	21
addressed	21
say	21
in	21
reply,	21
“Why	21
would	21
you	21
have	21
us	21
read	21
that	21
absurd	21
stuff,	21
Don	21
Juan,	21
when	21
it	21
is	21
impossible	21
for	21
anyone	21
who	21
has	21
read	21
the	21
First	21
Part	21
of	21
the	21
history	21
of	21
‘Don	21
Quixote	21
of	21
La	21
Mancha’	21
to	21
take	21
any	21
pleasure	21
in	21
reading	21
this	21
Second	21
Part?”	21
“For	21
all	21
that,”	21
said	21
he	21
who	21
was	21
addressed	21
as	21
Don	21
Juan,	21
“we	21
shall	21
do	21
well	21
to	21
read	21
it,	21
for	21
there	21
is	21
no	21
book	21
so	21
bad	21
but	21
it	21
has	21
something	21
good	21
in	21
it.	21
What	21
displeases	21
me	21
most	21
in	21
it	21
is	21
that	21
it	21
represents	21
Don	21
Quixote	21
as	21
now	21
cured	21
of	21
his	21
love	21
for	21
Dulcinea	21
del	21
Toboso.”	21
On	21
hearing	21
this	21
Don	21
Quixote,	21
full	21
of	21
wrath	21
and	21
indignation,	21
lifted	21
up	21
his	21
voice	21
and	21
said,	21
“Whoever	21
he	21
may	21
be	21
who	21
says	21
that	21
Don	21
Quixote	21
of	21
La	21
Mancha	21
has	21
forgotten	21
or	21
can	21
forget	21
Dulcinea	21
del	21
Toboso,	21
I	21
will	21
teach	21
him	21
with	21
equal	21
arms	21
that	21
what	21
he	21
says	21
is	21
very	21
far	21
from	21
the	21
truth;	21
for	21
neither	21
can	21
the	21
peerless	21
Dulcinea	21
del	21
Toboso	21
be	21
forgotten,	21
nor	21
can	21
forgetfulness	21
have	21
a	21
place	21
in	21
Don	21
Quixote;	21
his	21
motto	21
is	21
constancy,	21
and	21
his	21
profession	21
to	21
maintain	21
the	21
same	21
with	21
his	21
life	21
and	21
never	21
wrong	21
it.”	21
“Who	21
is	21
this	21
that	21
answers	21
us?”	21
said	21
they	21
in	21
the	21
next	21
room.	21
“Who	21
should	21
it	21
be,”	21
said	21
Sancho,	21
“but	21
Don	21
Quixote	21
of	21
La	21
Mancha	21
himself,	21
who	21
will	21
make	21
good	21
all	21
he	21
has	21
said	21
and	21
all	21
he	21
will	21
say;	21
for	21
pledges	21
don’t	21
trouble	21
a	21
good	21
payer.”	21
Sancho	21
had	21
hardly	21
uttered	21
these	21
words	21
when	21
two	21
gentlemen,	21
for	21
such	21
they	21
seemed	21
to	21
be,	21
entered	21
the	21
room,	21
and	21
one	21
of	21
them,	21
throwing	21
his	21
arms	21
round	21
Don	21
Quixote’s	21
neck,	21
said	21
to	21
him,	21
“Your	21
appearance	21
cannot	21
leave	21
any	21
question	21
as	21
to	21
your	21
name,	21
nor	21
can	21
your	21
name	21
fail	21
to	21
identify	21
your	21
appearance;	21
unquestionably,	21
señor,	21
you	21
are	21
the	21
real	21
Don	21
Quixote	21
of	21
La	21
Mancha,	21
cynosure	21
and	21
morning	21
star	21
of	21
knight-errantry,	21
despite	21
and	21
in	21
defiance	21
of	21
him	21
who	21
has	21
sought	21
to	21
usurp	21
your	21
name	21
and	21
bring	21
to	21
naught	21
your	21
achievements,	21
as	21
the	21
author	21
of	21
this	21
book	21
which	21
I	21
here	21
present	21
to	21
you	21
has	21
done;”	21
and	21
with	21
this	21
he	21
put	21
a	21
book	21
which	21
his	21
companion	21
carried	21
into	21
the	21
hands	21
of	21
Don	21
Quixote,	21
who	21
took	21
it,	21
and	21
without	21
replying	21
began	21
to	21
run	21
his	21
eye	21
over	21
it;	21
but	21
he	21
presently	21
returned	21
it	21
saying,	21
“In	21
the	21
little	21
I	21
have	21
seen	21
I	21
have	21
discovered	21
three	21
things	21
in	21
this	21
author	21
that	21
deserve	21
to	21
be	21
censured.	21
The	21
first	21
is	21
some	21
words	21
that	21
I	21
have	21
read	21
in	21
the	21
preface;	21
the	21
next	21
that	21
the	21
language	21
is	21
Aragonese,	21
for	21
sometimes	21
he	21
writes	21
without	21
articles;	21
and	21
the	21
third,	21
which	21
above	21
all	21
stamps	21
him	21
as	21
ignorant,	21
is	21
that	21
he	21
goes	21
wrong	21
and	21
departs	21
from	21
the	21
truth	21
in	21
the	21
most	21
important	21
part	21
of	21
the	21
history,	21
for	21
here	21
he	21
says	21
that	21
my	21
squire	21
Sancho	21
Panza’s	21
wife	21
is	21
called	21
Mari	21
Gutierrez,	21
when	21
she	21
is	21
called	21
nothing	21
of	21
the	21
sort,	21
but	21
Teresa	21
Panza;	21
and	21
when	21
a	21
man	21
errs	21
on	21
such	21
an	21
important	21
point	21
as	21
this	21
there	21
is	21
good	21
reason	21
to	21
fear	21
that	21
he	21
is	21
in	21
error	21
on	21
every	21
other	21
point	21
in	21
the	21
history.”	21
“A	21
nice	21
sort	21
of	21
historian,	21
indeed!”	21
exclaimed	21
Sancho	21
at	21
this;	21
“he	21
must	21
know	21
a	21
deal	21
about	21
our	21
affairs	21
when	21
he	21
calls	21
my	21
wife	21
Teresa	21
Panza,	21
Mari	21
Gutierrez;	21
take	21
the	21
book	21
again,	21
señor,	21
and	21
see	21
if	21
I	21
am	21
in	21
it	21
and	21
if	21
he	21
has	21
changed	21
my	21
name.”	21
“From	21
your	21
talk,	21
friend,”	21
said	21
Don	21
Jeronimo,	21
“no	21
doubt	21
you	21
are	21
Sancho	21
Panza,	21
Señor	21
Don	21
Quixote’s	21
squire.”	21
“Yes,	21
I	21
am,”	21
said	21
Sancho;	21
“and	21
I’m	21
proud	21
of	21
it.”	21
“Faith,	21
then,”	21
said	21
the	21
gentleman,	21
“this	21
new	21
author	21
does	21
not	21
handle	21
you	21
with	21
the	21
decency	21
that	21
displays	21
itself	21
in	21
your	21
person;	21
he	21
makes	21
you	21
out	21
a	21
heavy	21
feeder	21
and	21
a	21
fool,	21
and	21
not	21
in	21
the	21
least	21
droll,	21
and	21
a	21
very	21
different	21
being	21
from	21
the	21
Sancho	21
described	21
in	21
the	21
First	21
Part	21
of	21
your	21
master’s	21
history.”	21
“God	21
forgive	21
him,”	21
said	21
Sancho;	21
“he	21
might	21
have	21
left	21
me	21
in	21
my	21
corner	21
without	21
troubling	21
his	21
head	21
about	21
me;	21
‘let	21
him	21
who	21
knows	21
how	21
ring	21
the	21
bells;	21
‘Saint	21
Peter	21
is	21
very	21
well	21
in	21
Rome.’”	21
The	21
two	21
gentlemen	21
pressed	21
Don	21
Quixote	21
to	21
come	21
into	21
their	21
room	21
and	21
have	21
supper	21
with	21
them,	21
as	21
they	21
knew	21
very	21
well	21
there	21
was	21
nothing	21
in	21
that	21
inn	21
fit	21
for	21
one	21
of	21
his	21
sort.	21
Don	21
Quixote,	21
who	21
was	21
always	21
polite,	21
yielded	21
to	21
their	21
request	21
and	21
supped	21
with	21
them.	21
Sancho	21
stayed	21
behind	21
with	21
the	21
stew.	21
and	21
invested	21
with	21
plenary	21
delegated	21
authority	21
seated	21
himself	21
at	21
the	21
head	21
of	21
the	21
table,	21
and	21
the	21
landlord	21
sat	21
down	21
with	21
him,	21
for	21
he	21
was	21
no	21
less	21
fond	21
of	21
cow-heel	21
and	21
calves’	21
feet	21
than	21
Sancho	21
was.	21
While	21
at	21
supper	21
Don	21
Juan	21
asked	21
Don	21
Quixote	21
what	21
news	21
he	21
had	21
of	21
the	21
lady	21
Dulcinea	21
del	21
Toboso,	21
was	21
she	21
married,	21
had	21
she	21
been	21
brought	21
to	21
bed,	21
or	21
was	21
she	21
with	21
child,	21
or	21
did	21
she	21
in	21
maidenhood,	21
still	21
preserving	21
her	21
modesty	21
and	21
delicacy,	21
cherish	21
the	21
remembrance	21
of	21
the	21
tender	21
passion	21
of	21
Señor	21
Don	21
Quixote?	21
To	21
this	21
he	21
replied,	21
“Dulcinea	21
is	21
a	21
maiden	21
still,	21
and	21
my	21
passion	21
more	21
firmly	21
rooted	21
than	21
ever,	21
our	21
intercourse	21
unsatisfactory	21
as	21
before,	21
and	21
her	21
beauty	21
transformed	21
into	21
that	21
of	21
a	21
foul	21
country	21
wench;”	21
and	21
then	21
he	21
proceeded	21
to	21
give	21
them	21
a	21
full	21
and	21
particular	21
account	21
of	21
the	21
enchantment	21
of	21
Dulcinea,	21
and	21
of	21
what	21
had	21
happened	21
him	21
in	21
the	21
cave	21
of	21
Montesinos,	21
together	21
with	21
what	21
the	21
sage	21
Merlin	21
had	21
prescribed	21
for	21
her	21
disenchantment,	21
namely	21
the	21
scourging	21
of	21
Sancho.	21
Exceedingly	21
great	21
was	21
the	21
amusement	21
the	21
two	21
gentlemen	21
derived	21
from	21
hearing	21
Don	21
Quixote	21
recount	21
the	21
strange	21
incidents	21
of	21
his	21
history;	21
and	21
if	21
they	21
were	21
amazed	21
by	21
his	21
absurdities	21
they	21
were	21
equally	21
amazed	21
by	21
the	21
elegant	21
style	21
in	21
which	21
he	21
delivered	21
them.	21
On	21
the	21
one	21
hand	21
they	21
regarded	21
him	21
as	21
a	21
man	21
of	21
wit	21
and	21
sense,	21
and	21
on	21
the	21
other	21
he	21
seemed	21
to	21
them	21
a	21
maundering	21
blockhead,	21
and	21
they	21
could	21
not	21
make	21
up	21
their	21
minds	21
whereabouts	21
between	21
wisdom	21
and	21
folly	21
they	21
ought	21
to	21
place	21
him.	21
Sancho	21
having	21
finished	21
his	21
supper,	21
and	21
left	21
the	21
landlord	21
in	21
the	21
X	21
condition,	21
repaired	21
to	21
the	21
room	21
where	21
his	21
master	21
was,	21
and	21
as	21
he	21
came	21
in	21
said,	21
“May	21
I	21
die,	21
sirs,	21
if	21
the	21
author	21
of	21
this	21
book	21
your	21
worships	21
have	21
got	21
has	21
any	21
mind	21
that	21
we	21
should	21
agree;	21
as	21
he	21
calls	21
me	21
glutton	21
(according	21
to	21
what	21
your	21
worships	21
say)	21
I	21
wish	21
he	21
may	21
not	21
call	21
me	21
drunkard	21
too.”	21
“But	21
he	21
does,”	21
said	21
Don	21
Jeronimo;	21
“I	21
cannot	21
remember,	21
however,	21
in	21
what	21
way,	21
though	21
I	21
know	21
his	21
words	21
are	21
offensive,	21
and	21
what	21
is	21
more,	21
lying,	21
as	21
I	21
can	21
see	21
plainly	21
by	21
the	21
physiognomy	21
of	21
the	21
worthy	21
Sancho	21
before	21
me.”	21
“Believe	21
me,”	21
said	21
Sancho,	21
“the	21
Sancho	21
and	21
the	21
Don	21
Quixote	21
of	21
this	21
history	21
must	21
be	21
different	21
persons	21
from	21
those	21
that	21
appear	21
in	21
the	21
one	21
Cide	21
Hamete	21
Benengeli	21
wrote,	21
who	21
are	21
ourselves;	21
my	21
master	21
valiant,	21
wise,	21
and	21
true	21
in	21
love,	21
and	21
I	21
simple,	21
droll,	21
and	21
neither	21
glutton	21
nor	21
drunkard.”	21
“I	21
believe	21
it,”	21
said	21
Don	21
Juan;	21
“and	21
were	21
it	21
possible,	21
an	21
order	21
should	21
be	21
issued	21
that	21
no	21
one	21
should	21
have	21
the	21
presumption	21
to	21
deal	21
with	21
anything	21
relating	21
to	21
Don	21
Quixote,	21
save	21
his	21
original	21
author	21
Cide	21
Hamete;	21
just	21
as	21
Alexander	21
commanded	21
that	21
no	21
one	21
should	21
presume	21
to	21
paint	21
his	21
portrait	21
save	21
Apelles.”	21

“Let	21
him	21
who	21
will	21
paint	21
me,”	21
said	21
Don	21
Quixote;	21
“but	21
let	21
him	21
not	21
abuse	21
me;	21
for	21
patience	21
will	21
often	21
break	21
down	21
when	21
they	21
heap	21
insults	21
upon	21
it.”	21
“None	21
can	21
be	21
offered	21
to	21
Señor	21
Don	21
Quixote,”	21
said	21
Don	21
Juan,	21
“that	21
he	21
himself	21
will	21
not	21
be	21
able	21
to	21
avenge,	21
if	21
he	21
does	21
not	21
ward	21
it	21
off	21
with	21
the	21
shield	21
of	21
his	21
patience,	21
which,	21
I	21
take	21
it,	21
is	21
great	21
and	21
strong.”	21
A	21
considerable	21
portion	21
of	21
the	21
night	21
passed	21
in	21
conversation	21
of	21
this	21
sort,	21
and	21
though	21
Don	21
Juan	21
wished	21
Don	21
Quixote	21
to	21
read	21
more	21
of	21
the	21
book	21
to	21
see	21
what	21
it	21
was	21
all	21
about,	21
he	21
was	21
not	21
to	21
be	21
prevailed	21
upon,	21
saying	21
that	21
he	21
treated	21
it	21
as	21
read	21
and	21
pronounced	21
it	21
utterly	21
silly;	21
and,	21
if	21
by	21
any	21
chance	21
it	21
should	21
come	21
to	21
its	21
author’s	21
ears	21
that	21
he	21
had	21
it	21
in	21
his	21
hand,	21
he	21
did	21
not	21
want	21
him	21
to	21
flatter	21
himself	21
with	21
the	21
idea	21
that	21
he	21
had	21
read	21
it;	21
for	21
our	21
thoughts,	21
and	21
still	21
more	21
our	21
eyes,	21
should	21
keep	21
themselves	21
aloof	21
from	21
what	21
is	21
obscene	21
and	21
filthy.	21
They	21
asked	21
him	21
whither	21
he	21
meant	21
to	21
direct	21
his	21
steps.	21
He	21
replied,	21
to	21
Saragossa,	21
to	21
take	21
part	21
in	21
the	21
harness	21
jousts	21
which	21
were	21
held	21
in	21
that	21
city	21
every	21
year.	21
Don	21
Juan	21
told	21
him	21
that	21
the	21
new	21
history	21
described	21
how	21
Don	21
Quixote,	21
let	21
him	21
be	21
who	21
he	21
might,	21
took	21
part	21
there	21
in	21
a	21
tilting	21
at	21
the	21
ring,	21
utterly	21
devoid	21
of	21
invention,	21
poor	21
in	21
mottoes,	21
very	21
poor	21
in	21
costume,	21
though	21
rich	21
in	21
sillinesses.	21
“For	21
that	21
very	21
reason,”	21
said	21
Don	21
Quixote,	21
“I	21
will	21
not	21
set	21
foot	21
in	21
Saragossa;	21
and	21
by	21
that	21
means	21
I	21
shall	21
expose	21
to	21
the	21
world	21
the	21
lie	21
of	21
this	21
new	21
history	21
writer,	21
and	21
people	21
will	21
see	21
that	21
I	21
am	21
not	21
the	21
Don	21
Quixote	21
he	21
speaks	21
of.”	21
“You	21
will	21
do	21
quite	21
right,”	21
said	21
Don	21
Jeronimo;	21
“and	21
there	21
are	21
other	21
jousts	21
at	21
Barcelona	21
in	21
which	21
Señor	21
Don	21
Quixote	21
may	21
display	21
his	21
prowess.”	21
“That	21
is	21
what	21
I	21
mean	21
to	21
do,”	21
said	21
Don	21
Quixote;	21
“and	21
as	21
it	21
is	21
now	21
time,	21
I	21
pray	21
your	21
worships	21
to	21
give	21
me	21
leave	21
to	21
retire	21
to	21
bed,	21
and	21
to	21
place	21
and	21
retain	21
me	21
among	21
the	21
number	21
of	21
your	21
greatest	21
friends	21
and	21
servants.”	21
“And	21
me	21
too,”	21
said	21
Sancho;	21
“maybe	21
I’ll	21
be	21
good	21
for	21
something.”	21
With	21
this	21
they	21
exchanged	21
farewells,	21
and	21
Don	21
Quixote	21
and	21
Sancho	21
retired	21
to	21
their	21
room,	21
leaving	21
Don	21
Juan	21
and	21
Don	21
Jeronimo	21
amazed	21
to	21
see	21
the	21
medley	21
he	21
made	21
of	21
his	21
good	21
sense	21
and	21
his	21
craziness;	21
and	21
they	21
felt	21
thoroughly	21
convinced	21
that	21
these,	21
and	21
not	21
those	21
their	21
Aragonese	21
author	21
described,	21
were	21
the	21
genuine	21
Don	21
Quixote	21
and	21
Sancho.	21
Don	21
Quixote	21
rose	21
betimes,	21
and	21
bade	21
adieu	21
to	21
his	21
hosts	21
by	21
knocking	21
at	21
the	21
partition	21
of	21
the	21
other	21
room.	21
Sancho	21
paid	21
the	21
landlord	21
magnificently,	21
and	21
recommended	21
him	21
either	21
to	21
say	21
less	21
about	21
the	21
providing	21
of	21
his	21
inn	21
or	21
to	21
keep	21
it	21
better	21
provided.	21

It	21
was	21
a	21
fresh	21
morning	21
giving	21
promise	21
of	21
a	21
cool	21
day	21
as	21
Don	21
Quixote	21
quitted	21
the	21
inn,	21
first	21
of	21
all	21
taking	21
care	21
to	21
ascertain	21
the	21
most	21
direct	21
road	21
to	21
Barcelona	21
without	21
touching	21
upon	21
Saragossa;	21
so	21
anxious	21
was	21
he	21
to	21
make	21
out	21
this	21
new	21
historian,	21
who	21
they	21
said	21
abused	21
him	21
so,	21
to	21
be	21
a	21
liar.	21
Well,	21
as	21
it	21
fell	21
out,	21
nothing	21
worthy	21
of	21
being	21
recorded	21
happened	21
him	21
for	21
six	21
days,	21
at	21
the	21
end	21
of	21
which,	21
having	21
turned	21
aside	21
out	21
of	21
the	21
road,	21
he	21
was	21
overtaken	21
by	21
night	21
in	21
a	21
thicket	21
of	21
oak	21
or	21
cork	21
trees;	21
for	21
on	21
this	21
point	21
Cide	21
Hamete	21
is	21
not	21
as	21
precise	21
as	21
he	21
usually	21
is	21
on	21
other	21
matters.	21
Master	21
and	21
man	21
dismounted	21
from	21
their	21
beasts,	21
and	21
as	21
soon	21
as	21
they	21
had	21
settled	21
themselves	21
at	21
the	21
foot	21
of	21
the	21
trees,	21
Sancho,	21
who	21
had	22
a	22
good	22
noontide	22
meal	22
that	22
day,	22
let	22
himself,	22
without	22
more	22
ado,	22
pass	22
the	22
gates	22
of	22
sleep.	22
But	22
Don	22
Quixote,	22
whom	22
his	22
thoughts,	22
far	22
more	22
than	22
hunger,	22
kept	22
awake,	22
could	22
not	22
close	22
an	22
eye,	22
and	22
roamed	22
in	22
fancy	22
to	22
and	22
fro	22
through	22
all	22
sorts	22
of	22
places.	22
At	22
one	22
moment	22
it	22
seemed	22
to	22
him	22
that	22
he	22
was	22
in	22
the	22
cave	22
of	22
Montesinos	22
and	22
saw	22
Dulcinea,	22
transformed	22
into	22
a	22
country	22
wench,	22
skipping	22
and	22
mounting	22
upon	22
her	22
she-ass;	22
again	22
that	22
the	22
words	22
of	22
the	22
sage	22
Merlin	22
were	22
sounding	22
in	22
his	22
ears,	22
setting	22
forth	22
the	22
conditions	22
to	22
be	22
observed	22
and	22
the	22
exertions	22
to	22
be	22
made	22
for	22
the	22
disenchantment	22
of	22
Dulcinea.	22
He	22
lost	22
all	22
patience	22
when	22
he	22
considered	22
the	22
laziness	22
and	22
want	22
of	22
charity	22
of	22
his	22
squire	22
Sancho;	22
for	22
to	22
the	22
best	22
of	22
his	22
belief	22
he	22
had	22
only	22
given	22
himself	22
five	22
lashes,	22
a	22
number	22
paltry	22
and	22
disproportioned	22
to	22
the	22
vast	22
number	22
required.	22
At	22
this	22
thought	22
he	22
felt	22
such	22
vexation	22
and	22
anger	22
that	22
he	22
reasoned	22
the	22
matter	22
thus:	22
“If	22
Alexander	22
the	22
Great	22
cut	22
the	22
Gordian	22
knot,	22
saying,	22
‘To	22
cut	22
comes	22
to	22
the	22
same	22
thing	22
as	22
to	22
untie,’	22
and	22
yet	22
did	22
not	22
fail	22
to	22
become	22
lord	22
paramount	22
of	22
all	22
Asia,	22
neither	22
more	22
nor	22
less	22
could	22
happen	22
now	22
in	22
Dulcinea’s	22
disenchantment	22
if	22
I	22
scourge	22
Sancho	22
against	22
his	22
will;	22
for,	22
if	22
it	22
is	22
the	22
condition	22
of	22
the	22
remedy	22
that	22
Sancho	22
shall	22
receive	22
three	22
thousand	22
and	22
odd	22
lashes,	22
what	22
does	22
it	22
matter	22
to	22
me	22
whether	22
he	22
inflicts	22
them	22
himself,	22
or	22
someone	22
else	22
inflicts	22
them,	22
when	22
the	22
essential	22
point	22
is	22
that	22
he	22
receives	22
them,	22
let	22
them	22
come	22
from	22
whatever	22
quarter	22
they	22
may?”	22
With	22
this	22
idea	22
he	22
went	22
over	22
to	22
Sancho,	22
having	22
first	22
taken	22
Rocinante’s	22
reins	22
and	22
arranged	22
them	22
so	22
as	22
to	22
be	22
able	22
to	22
flog	22
him	22
with	22
them,	22
and	22
began	22
to	22
untie	22
the	22
points	22
(the	22
common	22
belief	22
is	22
he	22
had	22
but	22
one	22
in	22
front)	22
by	22
which	22
his	22
breeches	22
were	22
held	22
up;	22
but	22
the	22
instant	22
he	22
approached	22
him	22
Sancho	22
woke	22
up	22
in	22
his	22
full	22
senses	22
and	22
cried	22
out,	22
“What	22
is	22
this?	22
Who	22
is	22
touching	22
me	22
and	22
untrussing	22
me?”	22
“It	22
is	22
I,”	22
said	22
Don	22
Quixote,	22
“and	22
I	22
come	22
to	22
make	22
good	22
thy	22
shortcomings	22
and	22
relieve	22
my	22
own	22
distresses;	22
I	22
come	22
to	22
whip	22
thee,	22
Sancho,	22
and	22
wipe	22
off	22
some	22
portion	22
of	22
the	22
debt	22
thou	22
hast	22
undertaken.	22
Dulcinea	22
is	22
perishing,	22
thou	22
art	22
living	22
on	22
regardless,	22
I	22
am	22
dying	22
of	22
hope	22
deferred;	22
therefore	22
untruss	22
thyself	22
with	22
a	22
good	22
will,	22
for	22
mine	22
it	22
is,	22
here,	22
in	22
this	22
retired	22
spot,	22
to	22
give	22
thee	22
at	22
least	22
two	22
thousand	22
lashes.”	22
“Not	22
a	22
bit	22
of	22
it,”	22
said	22
Sancho;	22
“let	22
your	22
worship	22
keep	22
quiet,	22
or	22
else	22
by	22
the	22
living	22
God	22
the	22
deaf	22
shall	22
hear	22
us;	22
the	22
lashes	22
I	22
pledged	22
myself	22
to	22
must	22
be	22
voluntary	22
and	22
not	22
forced	22
upon	22
me,	22
and	22
just	22
now	22
I	22
have	22
no	22
fancy	22
to	22
whip	22
myself;	22
it	22
is	22
enough	22
if	22
I	22
give	22
you	22
my	22
word	22
to	22
flog	22
and	22
flap	22
myself	22
when	22
I	22
have	22
a	22
mind.”	22
“It	22
will	22
not	22
do	22
to	22
leave	22
it	22
to	22
thy	22
courtesy,	22
Sancho,”	22
said	22
Don	22
Quixote,	22
“for	22
thou	22
art	22
hard	22
of	22
heart	22
and,	22
though	22
a	22
clown,	22
tender	22
of	22
flesh;”	22
and	22
at	22
the	22
same	22
time	22
he	22
strove	22
and	22
struggled	22
to	22
untie	22
him.	22
Seeing	22
this	22
Sancho	22
got	22
up,	22
and	22
grappling	22
with	22
his	22
master	22
he	22
gripped	22
him	22
with	22
all	22
his	22
might	22
in	22
his	22
arms,	22
giving	22
him	22
a	22
trip	22
with	22
the	22
heel	22
stretched	22
him	22
on	22
the	22
ground	22
on	22
his	22
back,	22
and	22
pressing	22
his	22
right	22
knee	22
on	22
his	22
chest	22
held	22
his	22
hands	22
in	22
his	22
own	22
so	22
that	22
he	22
could	22
neither	22
move	22
nor	22
breathe.	22
“How	22
now,	22
traitor!”	22
exclaimed	22
Don	22
Quixote.	22
“Dost	22
thou	22
revolt	22
against	22
thy	22
master	22
and	22
natural	22
lord?	22
Dost	22
thou	22
rise	22
against	22
him	22
who	22
gives	22
thee	22
his	22
bread?”	22
“I	22
neither	22
put	22
down	22
king,	22
nor	22
set	22
up	22
king,”	22
said	22
Sancho;	22
“I	22
only	22
stand	22
up	22
for	22
myself	22
who	22
am	22
my	22
own	22
lord;	22
if	22
your	22
worship	22
promises	22
me	22
to	22
be	22
quiet,	22
and	22
not	22
to	22
offer	22
to	22
whip	22
me	22
now,	22
I’ll	22
let	22
you	22
go	22
free	22
and	22
unhindered;	22
if	22
not—	22
Traitor	22
and	22
Doña	22
Sancha’s	22
foe,	22
Thou	22
diest	22
on	22
the	22
spot.”	22
Don	22
Quixote	22
gave	22
his	22
promise,	22
and	22
swore	22
by	22
the	22
life	22
of	22
his	22
thoughts	22
not	22
to	22
touch	22
so	22
much	22
as	22
a	22
hair	22
of	22
his	22
garments,	22
and	22
to	22
leave	22
him	22
entirely	22
free	22
and	22
to	22
his	22
own	22
discretion	22
to	22
whip	22
himself	22
whenever	22
he	22
pleased.	22

Sancho	22
rose	22
and	22
removed	22
some	22
distance	22
from	22
the	22
spot,	22
but	22
as	22
he	22
was	22
about	22
to	22
place	22
himself	22
leaning	22
against	22
another	22
tree	22
he	22
felt	22
something	22
touch	22
his	22
head,	22
and	22
putting	22
up	22
his	22
hands	22
encountered	22
somebody’s	22
two	22
feet	22
with	22
shoes	22
and	22
stockings	22
on	22
them.	22
He	22
trembled	22
with	22
fear	22
and	22
made	22
for	22
another	22
tree,	22
where	22
the	22
very	22
same	22
thing	22
happened	22
to	22
him,	22
and	22
he	22
fell	22
a-shouting,	22
calling	22
upon	22
Don	22
Quixote	22
to	22
come	22
and	22
protect	22
him.	22
Don	22
Quixote	22
did	22
so,	22
and	22
asked	22
him	22
what	22
had	22
happened	22
to	22
him,	22
and	22
what	22
he	22
was	22
afraid	22
of.	22
Sancho	22
replied	22
that	22
all	22
the	22
trees	22
were	22
full	22
of	22
men’s	22
feet	22
and	22
legs.	22
Don	22
Quixote	22
felt	22
them,	22
and	22
guessed	22
at	22
once	22
what	22
it	22
was,	22
and	22
said	22
to	22
Sancho,	22
“Thou	22
hast	22
nothing	22
to	22
be	22
afraid	22
of,	22
for	22
these	22
feet	22
and	22
legs	22
that	22
thou	22
feelest	22
but	22
canst	22
not	22
see	22
belong	22
no	22
doubt	22
to	22
some	22
outlaws	22
and	22
freebooters	22
that	22
have	22
been	22
hanged	22
on	22
these	22
trees;	22
for	22
the	22
authorities	22
in	22
these	22
parts	22
are	22
wont	22
to	22
hang	22
them	22
up	22
by	22
twenties	22
and	22
thirties	22
when	22
they	22
catch	22
them;	22
whereby	22
I	22
conjecture	22
that	22
I	22
must	22
be	22
near	22
Barcelona;”	22
and	22
it	22
was,	22
in	22
fact,	22
as	22
he	22
supposed;	22
with	22
the	22
first	22
light	22
they	22
looked	22
up	22
and	22
saw	22
that	22
the	22
fruit	22
hanging	22
on	22
those	22
trees	22
were	22
freebooters’	22
bodies.	22
And	22
now	22
day	22
dawned;	22
and	22
if	22
the	22
dead	22
freebooters	22
had	22
scared	22
them,	22
their	22
hearts	22
were	22
no	22
less	22
troubled	22
by	22
upwards	22
of	22
forty	22
living	22
ones,	22
who	22
all	22
of	22
a	22
sudden	22
surrounded	22
them,	22
and	22
in	22
the	22
Catalan	22
tongue	22
bade	22
them	22
stand	22
and	22
wait	22
until	22
their	22
captain	22
came	22
up.	22
Don	22
Quixote	22
was	22
on	22
foot	22
with	22
his	22
horse	22
unbridled	22
and	22
his	22
lance	22
leaning	22
against	22
a	22
tree,	22
and	22
in	22
short	22
completely	22
defenceless;	22
he	22
thought	22
it	22
best	22
therefore	22
to	22
fold	22
his	22
arms	22
and	22
bow	22
his	22
head	22
and	22
reserve	22
himself	22
for	22
a	22
more	22
favourable	22
occasion	22
and	22
opportunity.	22
The	22
robbers	22
made	22
haste	22
to	22
search	22
Dapple,	22
and	22
did	22
not	22
leave	22
him	22
a	22
single	22
thing	22
of	22
all	22
he	22
carried	22
in	22
the	22
alforjas	22
and	22
in	22
the	22
valise;	22
and	22
lucky	22
it	22
was	22
for	22
Sancho	22
that	22
the	22
duke’s	22
crowns	22
and	22
those	22
he	22
brought	22
from	22
home	22
were	22
in	22
a	22
girdle	22
that	22
he	22
wore	22
round	22
him;	22
but	22
for	22
all	22
that	22
these	22
good	22
folk	22
would	22
have	22
stripped	22
him,	22
and	22
even	22
looked	22
to	22
see	22
what	22
he	22
had	22
hidden	22
between	22
the	22
skin	22
and	22
flesh,	22
but	22
for	22
the	22
arrival	22
at	22
that	22
moment	22
of	22
their	22
captain,	22
who	22
was	22
about	22
thirty-four	22
years	22
of	22
age	22
apparently,	22
strongly	22
built,	22
above	22
the	22
middle	22
height,	22
of	22
stern	22
aspect	22
and	22
swarthy	22
complexion.	22
He	22
was	22
mounted	22
upon	22
a	22
powerful	22
horse,	22
and	22
had	22
on	22
a	22
coat	22
of	22
mail,	22
with	22
four	22
of	22
the	22
pistols	22
they	22
call	22
petronels	22
in	22
that	22
country	22
at	22
his	22
waist.	22
He	22
saw	22
that	22
his	22
squires	22
(for	22
so	22
they	22
call	22
those	22
who	22
follow	22
that	22
trade)	22
were	22
about	22
to	22
rifle	22
Sancho	22
Panza,	22
but	22
he	22
ordered	22
them	22
to	22
desist	22
and	22
was	22
at	22
once	22
obeyed,	22
so	22
the	22
girdle	22
escaped.	22
He	22
wondered	22
to	22
see	22
the	22
lance	22
leaning	22
against	22
the	22
tree,	22
the	22
shield	22
on	22
the	22
ground,	22
and	22
Don	22
Quixote	22
in	22
armour	22
and	22
dejected,	22
with	22
the	22
saddest	22
and	22
most	22
melancholy	22
face	22
that	22
sadness	22
itself	22
could	22
produce;	22
and	22
going	22
up	22
to	22
him	22
he	22
said,	22
“Be	22
not	22
so	22
cast	22
down,	22
good	22
man,	22
for	22
you	22
have	22
not	22
fallen	22
into	22
the	22
hands	22
of	22
any	22
inhuman	22
Busiris,	22
but	22
into	22
Roque	22
Guinart’s,	22
which	22
are	22
more	22
merciful	22
than	22
cruel.”	22
“The	22
cause	22
of	22
my	22
dejection,”	22
returned	22
Don	22
Quixote,	22
“is	22
not	22
that	22
I	22
have	22
fallen	22
into	22
thy	22
hands,	22
O	22
valiant	22
Roque,	22
whose	22
fame	22
is	22
bounded	22
by	22
no	22
limits	22
on	22
earth,	22
but	22
that	22
my	22
carelessness	22
should	22
have	22
been	22
so	22
great	22
that	22
thy	22
soldiers	22
should	22
have	22
caught	22
me	22
unbridled,	22
when	22
it	22
is	22
my	22
duty,	22
according	22
to	22
the	22
rule	22
of	22
knight-errantry	22
which	22
I	22
profess,	22
to	22
be	22
always	22
on	22
the	22
alert	22
and	22
at	22
all	22
times	22
my	22
own	22
sentinel;	22
for	22
let	22
me	22
tell	22
thee,	22
great	22
Roque,	22
had	22
they	22
found	22
me	22
on	22
my	22
horse,	22
with	22
my	22
lance	22
and	22
shield,	22
it	22
would	22
not	22
have	22
been	22
very	22
easy	22
for	22
them	22
to	22
reduce	22
me	22
to	22
submission,	22
for	22
I	22
am	22
Don	22
Quixote	22
of	22
La	22
Mancha,	22
he	22
who	22
hath	22
filled	22
the	22
whole	22
world	22
with	22
his	22
achievements.”	22
Roque	22
Guinart	22
at	22
once	22
perceived	22
that	22
Don	22
Quixote’s	22
weakness	22
was	22
more	22
akin	22
to	22
madness	22
than	22
to	22
swagger;	22
and	22
though	22
he	22
had	22
sometimes	22
heard	22
him	22
spoken	22
of,	22
he	22
never	22
regarded	22
the	22
things	22
attributed	22
to	22
him	22
as	22
true,	22
nor	22
could	22
he	22
persuade	22
himself	22
that	22
such	22
a	22
humour	22
could	22
become	22
dominant	22
in	22
the	22
heart	22
of	22
man;	22
he	22
was	22
extremely	22
glad,	22
therefore,	22
to	22
meet	22
him	22
and	22
test	22
at	22
close	22
quarters	22
what	22
he	22
had	22
heard	22
of	22
him	22
at	22
a	22
distance;	22
so	22
he	22
said	22
to	22
him,	22
“Despair	22
not,	22
valiant	22
knight,	22
nor	22
regard	22
as	22
an	22
untoward	22
fate	22
the	22
position	22
in	22
which	22
thou	22
findest	22
thyself;	22
it	22
may	22
be	22
that	22
by	22
these	22
slips	22
thy	22
crooked	22
fortune	22
will	22
make	22
itself	22
straight;	22
for	22
heaven	22
by	22
strange	22
circuitous	22
ways,	22
mysterious	22
and	22
incomprehensible	22
to	22
man,	22
raises	22
up	22
the	22
fallen	22
and	22
makes	22
rich	22
the	22
poor.”	22
Don	22
Quixote	22
was	22
about	22
to	22
thank	22
him,	22
when	22
they	22
heard	22
behind	22
them	22
a	22
noise	22
as	22
of	22
a	22
troop	22
of	22
horses;	22
there	22
was,	22
however,	22
but	22
one,	22
riding	22
on	22
which	22
at	22
a	22
furious	22
pace	22
came	22
a	22
youth,	22
apparently	22
about	22
twenty	22
years	22
of	22
age,	22
clad	22
in	22
green	22
damask	22
edged	22
with	22
gold	22
and	22
breeches	22
and	22
a	22
loose	22
frock,	22
with	22
a	22
hat	22
looped	22
up	22
in	22
the	22
Walloon	22
fashion,	22
tight-fitting	22
polished	22
boots,	22
gilt	22
spurs,	22
dagger	22
and	22
sword,	22
and	22
in	22
his	22
hand	22
a	22
musketoon,	22
and	22
a	22
pair	22
of	22
pistols	22
at	22
his	22
waist.	22
Roque	22
turned	22
round	22
at	22
the	22
noise	22
and	22
perceived	22
this	22
comely	22
figure,	22
which	22
drawing	22
near	22
thus	22
addressed	22
him,	22
“I	22
came	22
in	22
quest	22
of	22
thee,	22
valiant	22
Roque,	22
to	22
find	22
in	22
thee	22
if	22
not	22
a	22
remedy	22
at	22
least	22
relief	22
in	22
my	22
misfortune;	22
and	22
not	22
to	22
keep	22
thee	22
in	22
suspense,	22
for	22
I	22
see	22
thou	22
dost	22
not	22
recognise	22
me,	22
I	22
will	22
tell	22
thee	22
who	22
I	22
am;	22
I	22
am	22
Claudia	22
Jeronima,	22
the	22
daughter	22
of	22
Simon	22
Forte,	22
thy	22
good	22
friend,	22
and	22
special	22
enemy	22
of	22
Clauquel	22
Torrellas,	22
who	22
is	22
thine	22
also	22
as	22
being	22
of	22
the	22
faction	22
opposed	22
to	22
thee.	22
Thou	22
knowest	22
that	22
this	22
Torrellas	22
has	22
a	22
son	22
who	22
is	22
called,	22
or	22
at	22
least	22
was	22
not	22
two	22
hours	22
since,	22
Don	22
Vicente	22
Torrellas.	22
Well,	22
to	22
cut	22
short	22
the	22
tale	22
of	22
my	22
misfortune,	22
I	22
will	22
tell	22
thee	22
in	22
a	22
few	22
words	22
what	22
this	22
youth	22
has	22
brought	22
upon	22
me.	22
He	22
saw	22
me,	22
he	22
paid	22
court	22
to	22
me,	22
I	22
listened	22
to	22
him,	22
and,	22
unknown	22
to	22
my	22
father,	22
I	22
loved	22
him;	22
for	22
there	22
is	22
no	22
woman,	22
however	22
secluded	22
she	22
may	22
live	22
or	22
close	22
she	22
may	22
be	22
kept,	22
who	22
will	22
not	22
have	22
opportunities	22
and	22
to	22
spare	22
for	22
following	22
her	22
headlong	22
impulses.	22
In	22
a	22
word,	22
he	22
pledged	22
himself	22
to	22
be	22
mine,	22
and	22
I	22
promised	22
to	22
be	22
his,	22
without	22
carrying	22
matters	22
any	22
further.	22
Yesterday	22
I	22
learned	22
that,	22
forgetful	22
of	22
his	22
pledge	22
to	22
me,	22
he	22
was	22
about	22
to	22
marry	22
another,	22
and	22
that	22
he	22
was	22
to	22
go	22
this	22
morning	22
to	22
plight	22
his	22
troth,	22
intelligence	22
which	22
overwhelmed	22
and	22
exasperated	22
me;	22
my	22
father	22
not	22
being	22
at	22
home	22
I	22
was	22
able	22
to	22
adopt	22
this	22
costume	22
you	22
see,	22
and	22
urging	22
my	22
horse	22
to	22
speed	22
I	22
overtook	22
Don	22
Vicente	22
about	22
a	22
league	22
from	22
this,	22
and	22
without	22
waiting	22
to	22
utter	22
reproaches	22
or	22
hear	22
excuses	22
I	22
fired	22
this	22
musket	22
at	22
him,	22
and	22
these	22
two	22
pistols	22
besides,	22
and	22
to	22
the	22
best	22
of	22
my	22
belief	22
I	22
must	22
have	22
lodged	22
more	22
than	22
two	22
bullets	22
in	22
his	22
body,	22
opening	22
doors	22
to	22
let	22
my	22
honour	22
go	22
free,	22
enveloped	22
in	22
his	22
blood.	22
I	22
left	22
him	22
there	22
in	22
the	22
hands	22
of	22
his	22
servants,	22
who	22
did	22
not	22
dare	22
and	22
were	22
not	22
able	22
to	22
interfere	22
in	22
his	22
defence,	22
and	22
I	22
come	22
to	22
seek	22
from	22
thee	22
a	22
safe-conduct	22
into	22
France,	22
where	22
I	22
have	22
relatives	22
with	22
whom	22
I	22
can	22
live;	22
and	22
also	22
to	22
implore	22
thee	22
to	22
protect	22
my	22
father,	22
so	22
that	22
Don	22
Vicente’s	22
numerous	22
kinsmen	22
may	22
not	22
venture	22
to	22
wreak	22
their	22
lawless	22
vengeance	22
upon	22
him.”	22
Roque,	22
filled	22
with	22
admiration	22
at	22
the	22
gallant	22
bearing,	22
high	22
spirit,	22
comely	22
figure,	22
and	22
adventure	22
of	22
the	22
fair	22
Claudia,	22
said	22
to	22
her,	22
“Come,	22
señora,	22
let	22
us	22
go	22
and	22
see	22
if	22
thy	22
enemy	22
is	22
dead;	22
and	22
then	22
we	22
will	22
consider	22
what	22
will	22
be	22
best	22
for	22
thee.”	22
Don	22
Quixote,	22
who	22
had	22
been	22
listening	22
to	22
what	22
Claudia	22
said	22
and	22
Roque	22
Guinart	22
said	22
in	22
reply	22
to	22
her,	22
exclaimed,	22
“Nobody	22
need	22
trouble	22
himself	22
with	22
the	22
defence	22
of	22
this	22
lady,	22
for	22
I	22
take	22
it	22
upon	22
myself.	22
Give	22
me	22
my	22
horse	22
and	22
arms,	22
and	22
wait	22
for	22
me	22
here;	22
I	22
will	22
go	22
in	22
quest	22
of	22
this	22
knight,	22
and	22
dead	22
or	22
alive	22
I	22
will	22
make	22
him	22
keep	22
his	22
word	22
plighted	22
to	22
so	22
great	22
beauty.”	22
“Nobody	22
need	22
have	22
any	22
doubt	22
about	22
that,”	22
said	22
Sancho,	22
“for	22
my	22
master	22
has	22
a	22
very	22
happy	22
knack	22
of	22
matchmaking;	22
it’s	22
not	22
many	22
days	22
since	22
he	22
forced	22
another	22
man	22
to	22
marry,	22
who	22
in	22
the	22
same	22
way	22
backed	22
out	22
of	22
his	22
promise	22
to	22
another	22
maiden;	22
and	22
if	22
it	22
had	22
not	22
been	22
for	22
his	22
persecutors	22
the	22
enchanters	22
changing	22
the	22
man’s	22
proper	22
shape	22
into	22
a	22
lacquey’s	22
the	22
said	22
maiden	22
would	22
not	22
be	22
one	22
this	22
minute.”	22
Roque,	22
who	22
was	22
paying	22
more	22
attention	22
to	22
the	22
fair	22
Claudia’s	22
adventure	22
than	22
to	22
the	22
words	22
of	22
master	22
or	22
man,	22
did	22
not	22
hear	22
them;	22
and	22
ordering	22
his	22
squires	22
to	22
restore	22
to	22
Sancho	22
everything	22
they	22
had	22
stripped	22
Dapple	22
of,	22
he	22
directed	22
them	22
to	22
return	22
to	22
the	22
place	22
where	22
they	22
had	22
been	22
quartered	22
during	22
the	22
night,	22
and	22
then	22
set	22
off	22
with	22
Claudia	22
at	22
full	22
speed	22
in	22
search	22
of	22
the	22
wounded	22
or	22
slain	22
Don	22
Vicente.	22
They	22
reached	22
the	22
spot	22
where	22
Claudia	22
met	22
him,	22
but	22
found	22
nothing	22
there	22
save	22
freshly	22
spilt	22
blood;	22
looking	22
all	22
round,	22
however,	22
they	22
descried	22
some	22
people	22
on	22
the	22
slope	22
of	22
a	22
hill	22
above	22
them,	22
and	22
concluded,	22
as	22
indeed	22
it	22
proved	22
to	22
be,	22
that	22
it	22
was	22
Don	22
Vicente,	22
whom	22
either	22
dead	22
or	22
alive	22
his	22
servants	22
were	22
removing	22
to	22
attend	22
to	22
his	22
wounds	22
or	22
to	22
bury	22
him.	22
They	22
made	22
haste	22
to	22
overtake	22
them,	22
which,	22
as	22
the	22
party	22
moved	22
slowly,	22
they	22
were	22
able	22
to	22
do	22
with	22
ease.	22
They	22
found	22
Don	22
Vicente	22
in	22
the	22
arms	22
of	22
his	22
servants,	22
whom	22
he	22
was	22
entreating	22
in	22
a	22
broken	22
feeble	22
voice	22
to	22
leave	22
him	22
there	22
to	22
die,	22
as	22
the	22
pain	22
of	22
his	22
wounds	22
would	22
not	22
suffer	22
him	22
to	22
go	22
any	22
farther.	22
Claudia	22
and	22
Roque	22
threw	22
themselves	22
off	22
their	22
horses	22
and	22
advanced	22
towards	22
him;	22
the	22
servants	22
were	22
overawed	22
by	22
the	22
appearance	22
of	22
Roque,	22
and	22
Claudia	22
was	22
moved	22
by	22
the	22
sight	22
of	22
Don	22
Vicente,	22
and	22
going	22
up	22
to	22
him	22
half	22
tenderly	22
half	22
sternly,	22
she	22
seized	22
his	22
hand	22
and	22
said	22
to	22
him,	22
“Hadst	22
thou	22
given	22
me	22
this	22
according	22
to	22
our	22
compact	22
thou	22
hadst	22
never	22
come	22
to	22
this	22
pass.”	22
The	22
wounded	22
gentleman	22
opened	22
his	22
all	22
but	22
closed	22
eyes,	22
and	22
recognising	22
Claudia	22
said,	22
“I	22
see	22
clearly,	22
fair	22
and	22
mistaken	22
lady,	22
that	22
it	22
is	22
thou	22
that	22
hast	22
slain	22
me,	22
a	22
punishment	22
not	22
merited	22
or	22
deserved	22
by	22
my	22
feelings	22
towards	22
thee,	22
for	22
never	22
did	22
I	22
mean	22
to,	22
nor	22
could	22
I,	22
wrong	22
thee	22
in	22
thought	22
or	22
deed.”	22
“It	22
is	22
not	22
true,	22
then,”	22
said	22
Claudia,	22
“that	22
thou	22
wert	22
going	22
this	22
morning	22
to	22
marry	22
Leonora	22
the	22
daughter	22
of	22
the	22
rich	22
Balvastro?”	22
“Assuredly	22
not,”	22
replied	22
Don	22
Vicente;	22
“my	22
cruel	22
fortune	22
must	22
have	22
carried	22
those	22
tidings	22
to	22
thee	22
to	22
drive	22
thee	22
in	22
thy	22
jealousy	22
to	22
take	22
my	22
life;	22
and	22
to	22
assure	22
thyself	22
of	22
this,	22
press	22
my	22
hands	22
and	22
take	22
me	22
for	22
thy	22
husband	22
if	22
thou	22
wilt;	22
I	22
have	22
no	22
better	22
satisfaction	22
to	22
offer	22
thee	22
for	22
the	22
wrong	22
thou	22
fanciest	22
thou	22
hast	22
received	22
from	22
me.”	22
Claudia	22
wrung	22
his	22
hands,	22
and	22
her	22
own	22
heart	22
was	22
so	22
wrung	22
that	22
she	22
lay	22
fainting	22
on	22
the	22
bleeding	22
breast	22
of	22
Don	22
Vicente,	22
whom	22
a	22
death	22
spasm	22
seized	22
the	22
same	22
instant.	22
Roque	22
was	22
in	22
perplexity	22
and	22
knew	22
not	22
what	22
to	22
do;	22
the	22
servants	22
ran	22
to	22
fetch	22
water	22
to	22
sprinkle	22
their	22
faces,	22
and	22
brought	22
some	22
and	22
bathed	22
them	22
with	22
it.	22
Claudia	22
recovered	22
from	22
her	22
fainting	22
fit,	22
but	22
not	22
so	22
Don	22
Vicente	22
from	22
the	22
paroxysm	22
that	22
had	22
overtaken	22
him,	22
for	22
his	22
life	22
had	22
come	22
to	22
an	22
end.	22
On	22
perceiving	22
this,	22
Claudia,	22
when	22
she	22
had	22
convinced	22
herself	22
that	22
her	22
beloved	22
husband	22
was	22
no	22
more,	22
rent	22
the	22
air	22
with	22
her	22
sighs	22
and	22
made	22
the	22
heavens	22
ring	22
with	22
her	22
lamentations;	22
she	22
tore	22
her	22
hair	22
and	22
scattered	22
it	22
to	22
the	22
winds,	22
she	22
beat	22
her	22
face	22
with	22
her	22
hands	22
and	22
showed	22
all	22
the	22
signs	22
of	22
grief	22
and	22
sorrow	22
that	22
could	22
be	22
conceived	22
to	22
come	22
from	22
an	22
afflicted	22
heart.	22
“Cruel,	22
reckless	22
woman!”	22
she	22
cried,	22
“how	22
easily	22
wert	22
thou	22
moved	22
to	22
carry	22
out	22
a	22
thought	22
so	22
wicked!	22
O	22
furious	22
force	22
of	22
jealousy,	22
to	22
what	22
desperate	22
lengths	22
dost	22
thou	22
lead	22
those	22
that	22
give	22
thee	22
lodging	22
in	22
their	22
bosoms!	22
O	22
husband,	22
whose	22
unhappy	22
fate	22
in	22
being	22
mine	22
hath	22
borne	22
thee	22
from	22
the	22
marriage	22
bed	22
to	22
the	22
grave!”	22
So	22
vehement	22
and	22
so	22
piteous	22
were	22
the	22
lamentations	22
of	22
Claudia	22
that	22
they	22
drew	22
tears	22
from	22
Roque’s	22
eyes,	22
unused	22
as	22
they	22
were	22
to	22
shed	22
them	22
on	22
any	22
occasion.	22
The	22
servants	22
wept,	22
Claudia	22
swooned	22
away	22
again	22
and	22
again,	22
and	22
the	22
whole	22
place	22
seemed	22
a	22
field	22
of	22
sorrow	22
and	22
an	22
abode	22
of	22
misfortune.	22
In	22
the	22
end	22
Roque	22
Guinart	22
directed	22
Don	22
Vicente’s	22
servants	22
to	22
carry	22
his	22
body	22
to	22
his	22
father’s	22
village,	22
which	22
was	22
close	22
by,	22
for	22
burial.	22
Claudia	22
told	22
him	22
she	22
meant	22
to	22
go	22
to	22
a	22
monastery	22
of	22
which	22
an	22
aunt	22
of	22
hers	22
was	22
abbess,	22
where	22
she	22
intended	22
to	22
pass	22
her	22
life	22
with	22
a	22
better	22
and	22
everlasting	22
spouse.	22
He	22
applauded	22
her	22
pious	22
resolution,	22
and	22
offered	22
to	22
accompany	22
her	22
whithersoever	22
she	22
wished,	22
and	22
to	22
protect	22
her	22
father	22
against	22
the	22
kinsmen	22
of	22
Don	22
Vicente	22
and	22
all	22
the	22
world,	22
should	22
they	22
seek	22
to	22
injure	22
him.	22
Claudia	22
would	22
not	22
on	22
any	22
account	22
allow	22
him	22
to	22
accompany	22
her;	22
and	22
thanking	22
him	22
for	22
his	22
offers	22
as	22
well	22
as	22
she	22
could,	22
took	22
leave	22
of	22
him	22
in	22
tears.	22
The	22
servants	22
of	22
Don	22
Vicente	22
carried	22
away	22
his	22
body,	22
and	22
Roque	22
returned	22
to	22
his	22
comrades,	22
and	22
so	22
ended	22
the	22
love	22
of	22
Claudia	22
Jeronima;	22
but	22
what	22
wonder,	22
when	22
it	22
was	22
the	22
insuperable	22
and	22
cruel	22
might	22
of	22
jealousy	22
that	22
wove	22
the	22
web	22
of	22
her	22
sad	22
story?	22

Roque	22
Guinart	22
found	22
his	22
squires	22
at	22
the	22
place	22
to	22
which	22
he	22
had	22
ordered	22
them,	22
and	22
Don	22
Quixote	22
on	22
Rocinante	22
in	22
the	22
midst	22
of	22
them	22
delivering	22
a	22
harangue	22
to	22
them	22
in	22
which	22
he	22
urged	22
them	22
to	22
give	22
up	22
a	22
mode	22
of	22
life	22
so	22
full	22
of	22
peril,	22
as	22
well	22
to	22
the	22
soul	22
as	22
to	22
the	22
body;	22
but	22
as	22
most	22
of	22
them	22
were	22
Gascons,	22
rough	22
lawless	22
fellows,	22
his	22
speech	22
did	22
not	22
make	22
much	22
impression	22
on	22
them.	22
Roque	22
on	22
coming	22
up	22
asked	22
Sancho	22
if	22
his	22
men	22
had	22
returned	22
and	22
restored	22
to	22
him	22
the	22
treasures	22
and	22
jewels	22
they	22
had	22
stripped	22
off	22
Dapple.	22
Sancho	22
said	22
they	22
had,	22
but	22
that	22
three	22
kerchiefs	22
that	22
were	22
worth	22
three	22
cities	22
were	22
missing.	22
“What	22
are	22
you	22
talking	22
about,	22
man?”	22
said	22
one	22
of	22
the	22
bystanders;	22
“I	22
have	22
got	22
them,	22
and	22
they	22
are	22
not	22
worth	22
three	22
reals.”	22
“That	22
is	22
true,”	22
said	22
Don	22
Quixote;	22
“but	22
my	22
squire	22
values	22
them	22
at	22
the	22
rate	22
he	22
says,	22
as	22
having	22
been	22
given	22
me	22
by	22
the	22
person	22
who	22
gave	22
them.”	22
Roque	22
Guinart	22
ordered	22
them	22
to	22
be	22
restored	22
at	22
once;	22
and	22
making	22
his	22
men	22
fall	22
in	23
line	23
he	23
directed	23
all	23
the	23
clothing,	23
jewellery,	23
and	23
money	23
that	23
they	23
had	23
taken	23
since	23
the	23
last	23
distribution	23
to	23
be	23
produced;	23
and	23
making	23
a	23
hasty	23
valuation,	23
and	23
reducing	23
what	23
could	23
not	23
be	23
divided	23
into	23
money,	23
he	23
made	23
shares	23
for	23
the	23
whole	23
band	23
so	23
equitably	23
and	23
carefully,	23
that	23
in	23
no	23
case	23
did	23
he	23
exceed	23
or	23
fall	23
short	23
of	23
strict	23
distributive	23
justice.	23
When	23
this	23
had	23
been	23
done,	23
and	23
all	23
left	23
satisfied,	23
Roque	23
observed	23
to	23
Don	23
Quixote,	23
“If	23
this	23
scrupulous	23
exactness	23
were	23
not	23
observed	23
with	23
these	23
fellows	23
there	23
would	23
be	23
no	23
living	23
with	23
them.”	23
Upon	23
this	23
Sancho	23
remarked,	23
“From	23
what	23
I	23
have	23
seen	23
here,	23
justice	23
is	23
such	23
a	23
good	23
thing	23
that	23
there	23
is	23
no	23
doing	23
without	23
it,	23
even	23
among	23
the	23
thieves	23
themselves.”	23
One	23
of	23
the	23
squires	23
heard	23
this,	23
and	23
raising	23
the	23
butt-end	23
of	23
his	23
harquebuss	23
would	23
no	23
doubt	23
have	23
broken	23
Sancho’s	23
head	23
with	23
it	23
had	23
not	23
Roque	23
Guinart	23
called	23
out	23
to	23
him	23
to	23
hold	23
his	23
hand.	23
Sancho	23
was	23
frightened	23
out	23
of	23
his	23
wits,	23
and	23
vowed	23
not	23
to	23
open	23
his	23
lips	23
so	23
long	23
as	23
he	23
was	23
in	23
the	23
company	23
of	23
these	23
people.	23
At	23
this	23
instant	23
one	23
or	23
two	23
of	23
those	23
squires	23
who	23
were	23
posted	23
as	23
sentinels	23
on	23
the	23
roads,	23
to	23
watch	23
who	23
came	23
along	23
them	23
and	23
report	23
what	23
passed	23
to	23
their	23
chief,	23
came	23
up	23
and	23
said,	23
“Señor,	23
there	23
is	23
a	23
great	23
troop	23
of	23
people	23
not	23
far	23
off	23
coming	23
along	23
the	23
road	23
to	23
Barcelona.”	23
To	23
which	23
Roque	23
replied,	23
“Hast	23
thou	23
made	23
out	23
whether	23
they	23
are	23
of	23
the	23
sort	23
that	23
are	23
after	23
us,	23
or	23
of	23
the	23
sort	23
we	23
are	23
after?”	23
“The	23
sort	23
we	23
are	23
after,”	23
said	23
the	23
squire.	23
“Well	23
then,	23
away	23
with	23
you	23
all,”	23
said	23
Roque,	23
“and	23
bring	23
them	23
here	23
to	23
me	23
at	23
once	23
without	23
letting	23
one	23
of	23
them	23
escape.”	23

They	23
obeyed,	23
and	23
Don	23
Quixote,	23
Sancho,	23
and	23
Roque,	23
left	23
by	23
themselves,	23
waited	23
to	23
see	23
what	23
the	23
squires	23
brought,	23
and	23
while	23
they	23
were	23
waiting	23
Roque	23
said	23
to	23
Don	23
Quixote,	23
“It	23
must	23
seem	23
a	23
strange	23
sort	23
of	23
life	23
to	23
Señor	23
Don	23
Quixote,	23
this	23
of	23
ours,	23
strange	23
adventures,	23
strange	23
incidents,	23
and	23
all	23
full	23
of	23
danger;	23
and	23
I	23
do	23
not	23
wonder	23
that	23
it	23
should	23
seem	23
so,	23
for	23
in	23
truth	23
I	23
must	23
own	23
there	23
is	23
no	23
mode	23
of	23
life	23
more	23
restless	23
or	23
anxious	23
than	23
ours.	23
What	23
led	23
me	23
into	23
it	23
was	23
a	23
certain	23
thirst	23
for	23
vengeance,	23
which	23
is	23
strong	23
enough	23
to	23
disturb	23
the	23
quietest	23
hearts.	23
I	23
am	23
by	23
nature	23
tender-hearted	23
and	23
kindly,	23
but,	23
as	23
I	23
said,	23
the	23
desire	23
to	23
revenge	23
myself	23
for	23
a	23
wrong	23
that	23
was	23
done	23
me	23
so	23
overturns	23
all	23
my	23
better	23
impulses	23
that	23
I	23
keep	23
on	23
in	23
this	23
way	23
of	23
life	23
in	23
spite	23
of	23
what	23
conscience	23
tells	23
me;	23
and	23
as	23
one	23
depth	23
calls	23
to	23
another,	23
and	23
one	23
sin	23
to	23
another	23
sin,	23
revenges	23
have	23
linked	23
themselves	23
together,	23
and	23
I	23
have	23
taken	23
upon	23
myself	23
not	23
only	23
my	23
own	23
but	23
those	23
of	23
others:	23
it	23
pleases	23
God,	23
however,	23
that,	23
though	23
I	23
see	23
myself	23
in	23
this	23
maze	23
of	23
entanglements,	23
I	23
do	23
not	23
lose	23
all	23
hope	23
of	23
escaping	23
from	23
it	23
and	23
reaching	23
a	23
safe	23
port.”	23
Don	23
Quixote	23
was	23
amazed	23
to	23
hear	23
Roque	23
utter	23
such	23
excellent	23
and	23
just	23
sentiments,	23
for	23
he	23
did	23
not	23
think	23
that	23
among	23
those	23
who	23
followed	23
such	23
trades	23
as	23
robbing,	23
murdering,	23
and	23
waylaying,	23
there	23
could	23
be	23
anyone	23
capable	23
of	23
a	23
virtuous	23
thought,	23
and	23
he	23
said	23
in	23
reply,	23
“Señor	23
Roque,	23
the	23
beginning	23
of	23
health	23
lies	23
in	23
knowing	23
the	23
disease	23
and	23
in	23
the	23
sick	23
man’s	23
willingness	23
to	23
take	23
the	23
medicines	23
which	23
the	23
physician	23
prescribes;	23
you	23
are	23
sick,	23
you	23
know	23
what	23
ails	23
you,	23
and	23
heaven,	23
or	23
more	23
properly	23
speaking	23
God,	23
who	23
is	23
our	23
physician,	23
will	23
administer	23
medicines	23
that	23
will	23
cure	23
you,	23
and	23
cure	23
gradually,	23
and	23
not	23
of	23
a	23
sudden	23
or	23
by	23
a	23
miracle;	23
besides,	23
sinners	23
of	23
discernment	23
are	23
nearer	23
amendment	23
than	23
those	23
who	23
are	23
fools;	23
and	23
as	23
your	23
worship	23
has	23
shown	23
good	23
sense	23
in	23
your	23
remarks,	23
all	23
you	23
have	23
to	23
do	23
is	23
to	23
keep	23
up	23
a	23
good	23
heart	23
and	23
trust	23
that	23
the	23
weakness	23
of	23
your	23
conscience	23
will	23
be	23
strengthened.	23
And	23
if	23
you	23
have	23
any	23
desire	23
to	23
shorten	23
the	23
journey	23
and	23
put	23
yourself	23
easily	23
in	23
the	23
way	23
of	23
salvation,	23
come	23
with	23
me,	23
and	23
I	23
will	23
show	23
you	23
how	23
to	23
become	23
a	23
knight-errant,	23
a	23
calling	23
wherein	23
so	23
many	23
hardships	23
and	23
mishaps	23
are	23
encountered	23
that	23
if	23
they	23
be	23
taken	23
as	23
penances	23
they	23
will	23
lodge	23
you	23
in	23
heaven	23
in	23
a	23
trice.”	23
Roque	23
laughed	23
at	23
Don	23
Quixote’s	23
exhortation,	23
and	23
changing	23
the	23
conversation	23
he	23
related	23
the	23
tragic	23
affair	23
of	23
Claudia	23
Jeronima,	23
at	23
which	23
Sancho	23
was	23
extremely	23
grieved;	23
for	23
he	23
had	23
not	23
found	23
the	23
young	23
woman’s	23
beauty,	23
boldness,	23
and	23
spirit	23
at	23
all	23
amiss.	23
And	23
now	23
the	23
squires	23
despatched	23
to	23
make	23
the	23
prize	23
came	23
up,	23
bringing	23
with	23
them	23
two	23
gentlemen	23
on	23
horseback,	23
two	23
pilgrims	23
on	23
foot,	23
and	23
a	23
coach	23
full	23
of	23
women	23
with	23
some	23
six	23
servants	23
on	23
foot	23
and	23
on	23
horseback	23
in	23
attendance	23
on	23
them,	23
and	23
a	23
couple	23
of	23
muleteers	23
whom	23
the	23
gentlemen	23
had	23
with	23
them.	23
The	23
squires	23
made	23
a	23
ring	23
round	23
them,	23
both	23
victors	23
and	23
vanquished	23
maintaining	23
profound	23
silence,	23
waiting	23
for	23
the	23
great	23
Roque	23
Guinart	23
to	23
speak.	23
He	23
asked	23
the	23
gentlemen	23
who	23
they	23
were,	23
whither	23
they	23
were	23
going,	23
and	23
what	23
money	23
they	23
carried	23
with	23
them;	23
“Señor,”	23
replied	23
one	23
of	23
them,	23
“we	23
are	23
two	23
captains	23
of	23
Spanish	23
infantry;	23
our	23
companies	23
are	23
at	23
Naples,	23
and	23
we	23
are	23
on	23
our	23
way	23
to	23
embark	23
in	23
four	23
galleys	23
which	23
they	23
say	23
are	23
at	23
Barcelona	23
under	23
orders	23
for	23
Sicily;	23
and	23
we	23
have	23
about	23
two	23
or	23
three	23
hundred	23
crowns,	23
with	23
which	23
we	23
are,	23
according	23
to	23
our	23
notions,	23
rich	23
and	23
contented,	23
for	23
a	23
soldier’s	23
poverty	23
does	23
not	23
allow	23
a	23
more	23
extensive	23
hoard.”	23
Roque	23
asked	23
the	23
pilgrims	23
the	23
same	23
questions	23
he	23
had	23
put	23
to	23
the	23
captains,	23
and	23
was	23
answered	23
that	23
they	23
were	23
going	23
to	23
take	23
ship	23
for	23
Rome,	23
and	23
that	23
between	23
them	23
they	23
might	23
have	23
about	23
sixty	23
reals.	23
He	23
asked	23
also	23
who	23
was	23
in	23
the	23
coach,	23
whither	23
they	23
were	23
bound	23
and	23
what	23
money	23
they	23
had,	23
and	23
one	23
of	23
the	23
men	23
on	23
horseback	23
replied,	23
“The	23
persons	23
in	23
the	23
coach	23
are	23
my	23
lady	23
Doña	23
Guiomar	23
de	23
Quiñones,	23
wife	23
of	23
the	23
regent	23
of	23
the	23
Vicaria	23
at	23
Naples,	23
her	23
little	23
daughter,	23
a	23
handmaid	23
and	23
a	23
duenna;	23
we	23
six	23
servants	23
are	23
in	23
attendance	23
upon	23
her,	23
and	23
the	23
money	23
amounts	23
to	23
six	23
hundred	23
crowns.”	23
“So	23
then,”	23
said	23
Roque	23
Guinart,	23
“we	23
have	23
got	23
here	23
nine	23
hundred	23
crowns	23
and	23
sixty	23
reals;	23
my	23
soldiers	23
must	23
number	23
some	23
sixty;	23
see	23
how	23
much	23
there	23
falls	23
to	23
each,	23
for	23
I	23
am	23
a	23
bad	23
arithmetician.”	23
As	23
soon	23
as	23
the	23
robbers	23
heard	23
this	23
they	23
raised	23
a	23
shout	23
of	23
“Long	23
life	23
to	23
Roque	23
Guinart,	23
in	23
spite	23
of	23
the	23
lladres	23
that	23
seek	23
his	23
ruin!”	23
The	23
captains	23
showed	23
plainly	23
the	23
concern	23
they	23
felt,	23
the	23
regent’s	23
lady	23
was	23
downcast,	23
and	23
the	23
pilgrims	23
did	23
not	23
at	23
all	23
enjoy	23
seeing	23
their	23
property	23
confiscated.	23
Roque	23
kept	23
them	23
in	23
suspense	23
in	23
this	23
way	23
for	23
a	23
while;	23
but	23
he	23
had	23
no	23
desire	23
to	23
prolong	23
their	23
distress,	23
which	23
might	23
be	23
seen	23
a	23
bowshot	23
off,	23
and	23
turning	23
to	23
the	23
captains	23
he	23
said,	23
“Sirs,	23
will	23
your	23
worships	23
be	23
pleased	23
of	23
your	23
courtesy	23
to	23
lend	23
me	23
sixty	23
crowns,	23
and	23
her	23
ladyship	23
the	23
regent’s	23
wife	23
eighty,	23
to	23
satisfy	23
this	23
band	23
that	23
follows	23
me,	23
for	23
‘it	23
is	23
by	23
his	23
singing	23
the	23
abbot	23
gets	23
his	23
dinner;’	23
and	23
then	23
you	23
may	23
at	23
once	23
proceed	23
on	23
your	23
journey,	23
free	23
and	23
unhindered,	23
with	23
a	23
safe-conduct	23
which	23
I	23
shall	23
give	23
you,	23
so	23
that	23
if	23
you	23
come	23
across	23
any	23
other	23
bands	23
of	23
mine	23
that	23
I	23
have	23
scattered	23
in	23
these	23
parts,	23
they	23
may	23
do	23
you	23
no	23
harm;	23
for	23
I	23
have	23
no	23
intention	23
of	23
doing	23
injury	23
to	23
soldiers,	23
or	23
to	23
any	23
woman,	23
especially	23
one	23
of	23
quality.”	23
Profuse	23
and	23
hearty	23
were	23
the	23
expressions	23
of	23
gratitude	23
with	23
which	23
the	23
captains	23
thanked	23
Roque	23
for	23
his	23
courtesy	23
and	23
generosity;	23
for	23
such	23
they	23
regarded	23
his	23
leaving	23
them	23
their	23
own	23
money.	23
Señora	23
Doña	23
Guiomar	23
de	23
Quiñones	23
wanted	23
to	23
throw	23
herself	23
out	23
of	23
the	23
coach	23
to	23
kiss	23
the	23
feet	23
and	23
hands	23
of	23
the	23
great	23
Roque,	23
but	23
he	23
would	23
not	23
suffer	23
it	23
on	23
any	23
account;	23
so	23
far	23
from	23
that,	23
he	23
begged	23
her	23
pardon	23
for	23
the	23
wrong	23
he	23
had	23
done	23
her	23
under	23
pressure	23
of	23
the	23
inexorable	23
necessities	23
of	23
his	23
unfortunate	23
calling.	23
The	23
regent’s	23
lady	23
ordered	23
one	23
of	23
her	23
servants	23
to	23
give	23
the	23
eighty	23
crowns	23
that	23
had	23
been	23
assessed	23
as	23
her	23
share	23
at	23
once,	23
for	23
the	23
captains	23
had	23
already	23
paid	23
down	23
their	23
sixty.	23
The	23
pilgrims	23
were	23
about	23
to	23
give	23
up	23
the	23
whole	23
of	23
their	23
little	23
hoard,	23
but	23
Roque	23
bade	23
them	23
keep	23
quiet,	23
and	23
turning	23
to	23
his	23
men	23
he	23
said,	23
“Of	23
these	23
crowns	23
two	23
fall	23
to	23
each	23
man	23
and	23
twenty	23
remain	23
over;	23
let	23
ten	23
be	23
given	23
to	23
these	23
pilgrims,	23
and	23
the	23
other	23
ten	23
to	23
this	23
worthy	23
squire	23
that	23
he	23
may	23
be	23
able	23
to	23
speak	23
favourably	23
of	23
this	23
adventure;”	23
and	23
then	23
having	23
writing	23
materials,	23
with	23
which	23
he	23
always	23
went	23
provided,	23
brought	23
to	23
him,	23
he	23
gave	23
them	23
in	23
writing	23
a	23
safe-conduct	23
to	23
the	23
leaders	23
of	23
his	23
bands;	23
and	23
bidding	23
them	23
farewell	23
let	23
them	23
go	23
free	23
and	23
filled	23
with	23
admiration	23
at	23
his	23
magnanimity,	23
his	23
generous	23
disposition,	23
and	23
his	23
unusual	23
conduct,	23
and	23
inclined	23
to	23
regard	23
him	23
as	23
an	23
Alexander	23
the	23
Great	23
rather	23
than	23
a	23
notorious	23
robber.	23
One	23
of	23
the	23
squires	23
observed	23
in	23
his	23
mixture	23
of	23
Gascon	23
and	23
Catalan,	23
“This	23
captain	23
of	23
ours	23
would	23
make	23
a	23
better	23
friar	23
than	23
highwayman;	23
if	23
he	23
wants	23
to	23
be	23
so	23
generous	23
another	23
time,	23
let	23
it	23
be	23
with	23
his	23
own	23
property	23
and	23
not	23
ours.”	23

The	23
unlucky	23
wight	23
did	23
not	23
speak	23
so	23
low	23
but	23
that	23
Roque	23
overheard	23
him,	23
and	23
drawing	23
his	23
sword	23
almost	23
split	23
his	23
head	23
in	23
two,	23
saying,	23
“That	23
is	23
the	23
way	23
I	23
punish	23
impudent	23
saucy	23
fellows.”	23
They	23
were	23
all	23
taken	23
aback,	23
and	23
not	23
one	23
of	23
them	23
dared	23
to	23
utter	23
a	23
word,	23
such	23
deference	23
did	23
they	23
pay	23
him.	23
Roque	23
then	23
withdrew	23
to	23
one	23
side	23
and	23
wrote	23
a	23
letter	23
to	23
a	23
friend	23
of	23
his	23
at	23
Barcelona,	23
telling	23
him	23
that	23
the	23
famous	23
Don	23
Quixote	23
of	23
La	23
Mancha,	23
the	23
knight-errant	23
of	23
whom	23
there	23
was	23
so	23
much	23
talk,	23
was	23
with	23
him,	23
and	23
was,	23
he	23
assured	23
him,	23
the	23
drollest	23
and	23
wisest	23
man	23
in	23
the	23
world;	23
and	23
that	23
in	23
four	23
days	23
from	23
that	23
date,	23
that	23
is	23
to	23
say,	23
on	23
Saint	23
John	23
the	23
Baptist’s	23
Day,	23
he	23
was	23
going	23
to	23
deposit	23
him	23
in	23
full	23
armour	23
mounted	23
on	23
his	23
horse	23
Rocinante,	23
together	23
with	23
his	23
squire	23
Sancho	23
on	23
an	23
ass,	23
in	23
the	23
middle	23
of	23
the	23
strand	23
of	23
the	23
city;	23
and	23
bidding	23
him	23
give	23
notice	23
of	23
this	23
to	23
his	23
friends	23
the	23
Niarros,	23
that	23
they	23
might	23
divert	23
themselves	23
with	23
him.	23
He	23
wished,	23
he	23
said,	23
his	23
enemies	23
the	23
Cadells	23
could	23
be	23
deprived	23
of	23
this	23
pleasure;	23
but	23
that	23
was	23
impossible,	23
because	23
the	23
crazes	23
and	23
shrewd	23
sayings	23
of	23
Don	23
Quixote	23
and	23
the	23
humours	23
of	23
his	23
squire	23
Sancho	23
Panza	23
could	23
not	23
help	23
giving	23
general	23
pleasure	23
to	23
all	23
the	23
world.	23
He	23
despatched	23
the	23
letter	23
by	23
one	23
of	23
his	23
squires,	23
who,	23
exchanging	23
the	23
costume	23
of	23
a	23
highwayman	23
for	23
that	23
of	23
a	23
peasant,	23
made	23
his	23
way	23
into	23
Barcelona	23
and	23
gave	23
it	23
to	23
the	23
person	23
to	23
whom	23
it	23
was	23
directed.	23

Don	23
Quixote	23
passed	23
three	23
days	23
and	23
three	23
nights	23
with	23
Roque,	23
and	23
had	23
he	23
passed	23
three	23
hundred	23
years	23
he	23
would	23
have	23
found	23
enough	23
to	23
observe	23
and	23
wonder	23
at	23
in	23
his	23
mode	23
of	23
life.	23
At	23
daybreak	23
they	23
were	23
in	23
one	23
spot,	23
at	23
dinner-time	23
in	23
another;	23
sometimes	23
they	23
fled	23
without	23
knowing	23
from	23
whom,	23
at	23
other	23
times	23
they	23
lay	23
in	23
wait,	23
not	23
knowing	23
for	23
what.	23
They	23
slept	23
standing,	23
breaking	23
their	23
slumbers	23
to	23
shift	23
from	23
place	23
to	23
place.	23
There	23
was	23
nothing	23
but	23
sending	23
out	23
spies	23
and	23
scouts,	23
posting	23
sentinels	23
and	23
blowing	23
the	23
matches	23
of	23
harquebusses,	23
though	23
they	23
carried	23
but	23
few,	23
for	23
almost	23
all	23
used	23
flintlocks.	23
Roque	23
passed	23
his	23
nights	23
in	23
some	23
place	23
or	23
other	23
apart	23
from	23
his	23
men,	23
that	23
they	23
might	23
not	23
know	23
where	23
he	23
was,	23
for	23
the	23
many	23
proclamations	23
the	23
viceroy	23
of	23
Barcelona	23
had	23
issued	23
against	23
his	23
life	23
kept	23
him	23
in	23
fear	23
and	23
uneasiness,	23
and	23
he	23
did	23
not	23
venture	23
to	23
trust	23
anyone,	23
afraid	23
that	23
even	23
his	23
own	23
men	23
would	23
kill	23
him	23
or	23
deliver	23
him	23
up	23
to	23
the	23
authorities;	23
of	23
a	23
truth,	23
a	23
weary	23
miserable	23
life!	23
At	23
length,	23
by	23
unfrequented	23
roads,	23
short	23
cuts,	23
and	23
secret	23
paths,	23
Roque,	23
Don	23
Quixote,	23
and	23
Sancho,	23
together	23
with	23
six	23
squires,	23
set	23
out	23
for	23
Barcelona.	23
They	23
reached	23
the	23
strand	23
on	23
Saint	23
John’s	23
Eve	23
during	23
the	23
night;	23
and	23
Roque,	23
after	23
embracing	23
Don	23
Quixote	23
and	23
Sancho	23
(to	23
whom	23
he	23
presented	23
the	23
ten	23
crowns	23
he	23
had	23
promised	23
but	23
had	23
not	23
until	23
then	23
given),	23
left	23
them	23
with	23
many	23
expressions	23
of	23
good-will	23
on	23
both	23
sides.	23
Roque	23
went	23
back,	23
while	23
Don	23
Quixote	23
remained	23
on	23
horseback,	23
just	23
as	23
he	23
was,	23
waiting	23
for	23
day,	23
and	23
it	23
was	23
not	23
long	23
before	23
the	23
countenance	23
of	23
the	23
fair	23
Aurora	23
began	23
to	23
show	23
itself	23
at	23
the	23
balconies	23
of	23
the	23
east,	23
gladdening	23
the	23
grass	23
and	23
flowers,	23
if	23
not	23
the	23
ear,	23
though	23
to	23
gladden	23
that	23
too	23
there	23
came	23
at	23
the	23
same	23
moment	23
a	23
sound	23
of	23
clarions	23
and	23
drums,	23
and	23
a	23
din	23
of	23
bells,	23
and	23
a	23
tramp,	24
and	24
cries	24
of	24
“Clear	24
the	24
way	24
there!”	24
of	24
some	24
runners,	24
that	24
seemed	24
to	24
issue	24
from	24
the	24
city.	24

The	24
dawn	24
made	24
way	24
for	24
the	24
sun	24
that	24
with	24
a	24
face	24
broader	24
than	24
a	24
buckler	24
began	24
to	24
rise	24
slowly	24
above	24
the	24
low	24
line	24
of	24
the	24
horizon;	24
Don	24
Quixote	24
and	24
Sancho	24
gazed	24
all	24
round	24
them;	24
they	24
beheld	24
the	24
sea,	24
a	24
sight	24
until	24
then	24
unseen	24
by	24
them;	24
it	24
struck	24
them	24
as	24
exceedingly	24
spacious	24
and	24
broad,	24
much	24
more	24
so	24
than	24
the	24
lakes	24
of	24
Ruidera	24
which	24
they	24
had	24
seen	24
in	24
La	24
Mancha.	24
They	24
saw	24
the	24
galleys	24
along	24
the	24
beach,	24
which,	24
lowering	24
their	24
awnings,	24
displayed	24
themselves	24
decked	24
with	24
streamers	24
and	24
pennons	24
that	24
trembled	24
in	24
the	24
breeze	24
and	24
kissed	24
and	24
swept	24
the	24
water,	24
while	24
on	24
board	24
the	24
bugles,	24
trumpets,	24
and	24
clarions	24
were	24
sounding	24
and	24
filling	24
the	24
air	24
far	24
and	24
near	24
with	24
melodious	24
warlike	24
notes.	24
Then	24
they	24
began	24
to	24
move	24
and	24
execute	24
a	24
kind	24
of	24
skirmish	24
upon	24
the	24
calm	24
water,	24
while	24
a	24
vast	24
number	24
of	24
horsemen	24
on	24
fine	24
horses	24
and	24
in	24
showy	24
liveries,	24
issuing	24
from	24
the	24
city,	24
engaged	24
on	24
their	24
side	24
in	24
a	24
somewhat	24
similar	24
movement.	24
The	24
soldiers	24
on	24
board	24
the	24
galleys	24
kept	24
up	24
a	24
ceaseless	24
fire,	24
which	24
they	24
on	24
the	24
walls	24
and	24
forts	24
of	24
the	24
city	24
returned,	24
and	24
the	24
heavy	24
cannon	24
rent	24
the	24
air	24
with	24
the	24
tremendous	24
noise	24
they	24
made,	24
to	24
which	24
the	24
gangway	24
guns	24
of	24
the	24
galleys	24
replied.	24
The	24
bright	24
sea,	24
the	24
smiling	24
earth,	24
the	24
clear	24
air—though	24
at	24
times	24
darkened	24
by	24
the	24
smoke	24
of	24
the	24
guns—all	24
seemed	24
to	24
fill	24
the	24
whole	24
multitude	24
with	24
unexpected	24
delight.	24
Sancho	24
could	24
not	24
make	24
out	24
how	24
it	24
was	24
that	24
those	24
great	24
masses	24
that	24
moved	24
over	24
the	24
sea	24
had	24
so	24
many	24
feet.	24
And	24
now	24
the	24
horsemen	24
in	24
livery	24
came	24
galloping	24
up	24
with	24
shouts	24
and	24
outlandish	24
cries	24
and	24
cheers	24
to	24
where	24
Don	24
Quixote	24
stood	24
amazed	24
and	24
wondering;	24
and	24
one	24
of	24
them,	24
he	24
to	24
whom	24
Roque	24
had	24
sent	24
word,	24
addressing	24
him	24
exclaimed,	24
“Welcome	24
to	24
our	24
city,	24
mirror,	24
beacon,	24
star	24
and	24
cynosure	24
of	24
all	24
knight-errantry	24
in	24
its	24
widest	24
extent!	24
Welcome,	24
I	24
say,	24
valiant	24
Don	24
Quixote	24
of	24
La	24
Mancha;	24
not	24
the	24
false,	24
the	24
fictitious,	24
the	24
apocryphal,	24
that	24
these	24
latter	24
days	24
have	24
offered	24
us	24
in	24
lying	24
histories,	24
but	24
the	24
true,	24
the	24
legitimate,	24
the	24
real	24
one	24
that	24
Cide	24
Hamete	24
Benengeli,	24
flower	24
of	24
historians,	24
has	24
described	24
to	24
us!”	24
Don	24
Quixote	24
made	24
no	24
answer,	24
nor	24
did	24
the	24
horsemen	24
wait	24
for	24
one,	24
but	24
wheeling	24
again	24
with	24
all	24
their	24
followers,	24
they	24
began	24
curvetting	24
round	24
Don	24
Quixote,	24
who,	24
turning	24
to	24
Sancho,	24
said,	24
“These	24
gentlemen	24
have	24
plainly	24
recognised	24
us;	24
I	24
will	24
wager	24
they	24
have	24
read	24
our	24
history,	24
and	24
even	24
that	24
newly	24
printed	24
one	24
by	24
the	24
Aragonese.”	24
The	24
cavalier	24
who	24
had	24
addressed	24
Don	24
Quixote	24
again	24
approached	24
him	24
and	24
said,	24
“Come	24
with	24
us,	24
Señor	24
Don	24
Quixote,	24
for	24
we	24
are	24
all	24
of	24
us	24
your	24
servants	24
and	24
great	24
friends	24
of	24
Roque	24
Guinart’s;”	24
to	24
which	24
Don	24
Quixote	24
returned,	24
“If	24
courtesy	24
breeds	24
courtesy,	24
yours,	24
sir	24
knight,	24
is	24
daughter	24
or	24
very	24
nearly	24
akin	24
to	24
the	24
great	24
Roque’s;	24
carry	24
me	24
where	24
you	24
please;	24
I	24
will	24
have	24
no	24
will	24
but	24
yours,	24
especially	24
if	24
you	24
deign	24
to	24
employ	24
it	24
in	24
your	24
service.”	24

The	24
cavalier	24
replied	24
with	24
words	24
no	24
less	24
polite,	24
and	24
then,	24
all	24
closing	24
in	24
around	24
him,	24
they	24
set	24
out	24
with	24
him	24
for	24
the	24
city,	24
to	24
the	24
music	24
of	24
the	24
clarions	24
and	24
the	24
drums.	24
As	24
they	24
were	24
entering	24
it,	24
the	24
wicked	24
one,	24
who	24
is	24
the	24
author	24
of	24
all	24
mischief,	24
and	24
the	24
boys	24
who	24
are	24
wickeder	24
than	24
the	24
wicked	24
one,	24
contrived	24
that	24
a	24
couple	24
of	24
these	24
audacious	24
irrepressible	24
urchins	24
should	24
force	24
their	24
way	24
through	24
the	24
crowd,	24
and	24
lifting	24
up,	24
one	24
of	24
them	24
Dapple’s	24
tail	24
and	24
the	24
other	24
Rocinante’s,	24
insert	24
a	24
bunch	24
of	24
furze	24
under	24
each.	24
The	24
poor	24
beasts	24
felt	24
the	24
strange	24
spurs	24
and	24
added	24
to	24
their	24
anguish	24
by	24
pressing	24
their	24
tails	24
tight,	24
so	24
much	24
so	24
that,	24
cutting	24
a	24
multitude	24
of	24
capers,	24
they	24
flung	24
their	24
masters	24
to	24
the	24
ground.	24
Don	24
Quixote,	24
covered	24
with	24
shame	24
and	24
out	24
of	24
countenance,	24
ran	24
to	24
pluck	24
the	24
plume	24
from	24
his	24
poor	24
jade’s	24
tail,	24
while	24
Sancho	24
did	24
the	24
same	24
for	24
Dapple.	24
His	24
conductors	24
tried	24
to	24
punish	24
the	24
audacity	24
of	24
the	24
boys,	24
but	24
there	24
was	24
no	24
possibility	24
of	24
doing	24
so,	24
for	24
they	24
hid	24
themselves	24
among	24
the	24
hundreds	24
of	24
others	24
that	24
were	24
following	24
them.	24
Don	24
Quixote	24
and	24
Sancho	24
mounted	24
once	24
more,	24
and	24
with	24
the	24
same	24
music	24
and	24
acclamations	24
reached	24
their	24
conductor’s	24
house,	24
which	24
was	24
large	24
and	24
stately,	24
that	24
of	24
a	24
rich	24
gentleman,	24
in	24
short;	24
and	24
there	24
for	24
the	24
present	24
we	24
will	24
leave	24
them,	24
for	24

is	24
Cide	24
Hamete’s	24
pleasure.	24

Don	24
Quixote’s	24
host	24
was	24
one	24
Don	24
Antonio	24
Moreno	24
by	24
name,	24
a	24
gentleman	24
of	24
wealth	24
and	24
intelligence,	24
and	24
very	24
fond	24
of	24
diverting	24
himself	24
in	24
any	24
fair	24
and	24
good-natured	24
way;	24
and	24
having	24
Don	24
Quixote	24
in	24
his	24
house	24
he	24
set	24
about	24
devising	24
modes	24
of	24
making	24
him	24
exhibit	24
his	24
mad	24
points	24
in	24
some	24
harmless	24
fashion;	24
for	24
jests	24
that	24
give	24
pain	24
are	24
no	24
jests,	24
and	24
no	24
sport	24
is	24
worth	24
anything	24
if	24
it	24
hurts	24
another.	24
The	24
first	24
thing	24
he	24
did	24
was	24
to	24
make	24
Don	24
Quixote	24
take	24
off	24
his	24
armour,	24
and	24
lead	24
him,	24
in	24
that	24
tight	24
chamois	24
suit	24
we	24
have	24
already	24
described	24
and	24
depicted	24
more	24
than	24
once,	24
out	24
on	24
a	24
balcony	24
overhanging	24
one	24
of	24
the	24
chief	24
streets	24
of	24
the	24
city,	24
in	24
full	24
view	24
of	24
the	24
crowd	24
and	24
of	24
the	24
boys,	24
who	24
gazed	24
at	24
him	24
as	24
they	24
would	24
at	24
a	24
monkey.	24
The	24
cavaliers	24
in	24
livery	24
careered	24
before	24
him	24
again	24
as	24
though	24
it	24
were	24
for	24
him	24
alone,	24
and	24
not	24
to	24
enliven	24
the	24
festival	24
of	24
the	24
day,	24
that	24
they	24
wore	24
it,	24
and	24
Sancho	24
was	24
in	24
high	24
delight,	24
for	24
it	24
seemed	24
to	24
him	24
that,	24
how	24
he	24
knew	24
not,	24
he	24
had	24
fallen	24
upon	24
another	24
Camacho’s	24
wedding,	24
another	24
house	24
like	24
Don	24
Diego	24
de	24
Miranda’s,	24
another	24
castle	24
like	24
the	24
duke’s.	24
Some	24
of	24
Don	24
Antonio’s	24
friends	24
dined	24
with	24
him	24
that	24
day,	24
and	24
all	24
showed	24
honour	24
to	24
Don	24
Quixote	24
and	24
treated	24
him	24
as	24
a	24
knight-errant,	24
and	24
he	24
becoming	24
puffed	24
up	24
and	24
exalted	24
in	24
consequence	24
could	24
not	24
contain	24
himself	24
for	24
satisfaction.	24
Such	24
were	24
the	24
drolleries	24
of	24
Sancho	24
that	24
all	24
the	24
servants	24
of	24
the	24
house,	24
and	24
all	24
who	24
heard	24
him,	24
were	24
kept	24
hanging	24
upon	24
his	24
lips.	24
While	24
at	24
table	24
Don	24
Antonio	24
said	24
to	24
him,	24
“We	24
hear,	24
worthy	24
Sancho,	24
that	24
you	24
are	24
so	24
fond	24
of	24
manjar	24
blanco	24
and	24
forced-meat	24
balls,	24
that	24
if	24
you	24
have	24
any	24
left,	24
you	24
keep	24
them	24
in	24
your	24
bosom	24
for	24
the	24
next	24
day.”	24
“No,	24
señor,	24
that’s	24
not	24
true,”	24
said	24
Sancho,	24
“for	24
I	24
am	24
more	24
cleanly	24
than	24
greedy,	24
and	24
my	24
master	24
Don	24
Quixote	24
here	24
knows	24
well	24
that	24
we	24
two	24
are	24
used	24
to	24
live	24
for	24
a	24
week	24
on	24
a	24
handful	24
of	24
acorns	24
or	24
nuts.	24
To	24
be	24
sure,	24
if	24
it	24
so	24
happens	24
that	24
they	24
offer	24
me	24
a	24
heifer,	24
I	24
run	24
with	24
a	24
halter;	24
I	24
mean,	24
I	24
eat	24
what	24
I’m	24
given,	24
and	24
make	24
use	24
of	24
opportunities	24
as	24
I	24
find	24
them;	24
but	24
whoever	24
says	24
that	24
I’m	24
an	24
out-of-the-way	24
eater	24
or	24
not	24
cleanly,	24
let	24
me	24
tell	24
him	24
that	24
he	24
is	24
wrong;	24
and	24
I’d	24
put	24
it	24
in	24
a	24
different	24
way	24
if	24
I	24
did	24
not	24
respect	24
the	24
honourable	24
beards	24
that	24
are	24
at	24
the	24
table.”	24
“Indeed,”	24
said	24
Don	24
Quixote,	24
“Sancho’s	24
moderation	24
and	24
cleanliness	24
in	24
eating	24
might	24
be	24
inscribed	24
and	24
graved	24
on	24
plates	24
of	24
brass,	24
to	24
be	24
kept	24
in	24
eternal	24
remembrance	24
in	24
ages	24
to	24
come.	24
It	24
is	24
true	24
that	24
when	24
he	24
is	24
hungry	24
there	24
is	24
a	24
certain	24
appearance	24
of	24
voracity	24
about	24
him,	24
for	24
he	24
eats	24
at	24
a	24
great	24
pace	24
and	24
chews	24
with	24
both	24
jaws;	24
but	24
cleanliness	24
he	24
is	24
always	24
mindful	24
of;	24
and	24
when	24
he	24
was	24
governor	24
he	24
learned	24
how	24
to	24
eat	24
daintily,	24
so	24
much	24
so	24
that	24
he	24
eats	24
grapes,	24
and	24
even	24
pomegranate	24
pips,	24
with	24
a	24
fork.”	24
“What!”	24
said	24
Don	24
Antonio,	24
“has	24
Sancho	24
been	24
a	24
governor?”	24
“Ay,”	24
said	24
Sancho,	24
“and	24
of	24
an	24
island	24
called	24
Barataria.	24
I	24
governed	24
it	24
to	24
perfection	24
for	24
ten	24
days;	24
and	24
lost	24
my	24
rest	24
all	24
the	24
time;	24
and	24
learned	24
to	24
look	24
down	24
upon	24
all	24
the	24
governments	24
in	24
the	24
world;	24
I	24
got	24
out	24
of	24
it	24
by	24
taking	24
to	24
flight,	24
and	24
fell	24
into	24
a	24
pit	24
where	24
I	24
gave	24
myself	24
up	24
for	24
dead,	24
and	24
out	24
of	24
which	24
I	24
escaped	24
alive	24
by	24
a	24
miracle.”	24
Don	24
Quixote	24
then	24
gave	24
them	24
a	24
minute	24
account	24
of	24
the	24
whole	24
affair	24
of	24
Sancho’s	24
government,	24
with	24
which	24
he	24
greatly	24
amused	24
his	24
hearers.	24
On	24
the	24
cloth	24
being	24
removed	24
Don	24
Antonio,	24
taking	24
Don	24
Quixote	24
by	24
the	24
hand,	24
passed	24
with	24
him	24
into	24
a	24
distant	24
room	24
in	24
which	24
there	24
was	24
nothing	24
in	24
the	24
way	24
of	24
furniture	24
except	24
a	24
table,	24
apparently	24
of	24
jasper,	24
resting	24
on	24
a	24
pedestal	24
of	24
the	24
same,	24
upon	24
which	24
was	24
set	24
up,	24
after	24
the	24
fashion	24
of	24
the	24
busts	24
of	24
the	24
Roman	24
emperors,	24
a	24
head	24
which	24
seemed	24
to	24
be	24
of	24
bronze.	24
Don	24
Antonio	24
traversed	24
the	24
whole	24
apartment	24
with	24
Don	24
Quixote	24
and	24
walked	24
round	24
the	24
table	24
several	24
times,	24
and	24
then	24
said,	24
“Now,	24
Señor	24
Don	24
Quixote,	24
that	24
I	24
am	24
satisfied	24
that	24
no	24
one	24
is	24
listening	24
to	24
us,	24
and	24
that	24
the	24
door	24
is	24
shut,	24
I	24
will	24
tell	24
you	24
of	24
one	24
of	24
the	24
rarest	24
adventures,	24
or	24
more	24
properly	24
speaking	24
strange	24
things,	24
that	24
can	24
be	24
imagined,	24
on	24
condition	24
that	24
you	24
will	24
keep	24
what	24
I	24
say	24
to	24
you	24
in	24
the	24
remotest	24
recesses	24
of	24
secrecy.”	24
“I	24
swear	24
it,”	24
said	24
Don	24
Quixote,	24
“and	24
for	24
greater	24
security	24
I	24
will	24
put	24
a	24
flag-stone	24
over	24
it;	24
for	24
I	24
would	24
have	24
you	24
know,	24
Señor	24
Don	24
Antonio”	24
(he	24
had	24
by	24
this	24
time	24
learned	24
his	24
name),	24
“that	24
you	24
are	24
addressing	24
one	24
who,	24
though	24
he	24
has	24
ears	24
to	24
hear,	24
has	24
no	24
tongue	24
to	24
speak;	24
so	24
that	24
you	24
may	24
safely	24
transfer	24
whatever	24
you	24
have	24
in	24
your	24
bosom	24
into	24
mine,	24
and	24
rely	24
upon	24
it	24
that	24
you	24
have	24
consigned	24
it	24
to	24
the	24
depths	24
of	24
silence.”	24
“In	24
reliance	24
upon	24
that	24
promise,”	24
said	24
Don	24
Antonio,	24
“I	24
will	24
astonish	24
you	24
with	24
what	24
you	24
shall	24
see	24
and	24
hear,	24
and	24
relieve	24
myself	24
of	24
some	24
of	24
the	24
vexation	24
it	24
gives	24
me	24
to	24
have	24
no	24
one	24
to	24
whom	24
I	24
can	24
confide	24
my	24
secrets,	24
for	24
they	24
are	24
not	24
of	24
a	24
sort	24
to	24
be	24
entrusted	24
to	24
everybody.”	24
Don	24
Quixote	24
was	24
puzzled,	24
wondering	24
what	24
could	24
be	24
the	24
object	24
of	24
such	24
precautions;	24
whereupon	24
Don	24
Antonio	24
taking	24
his	24
hand	24
passed	24
it	24
over	24
the	24
bronze	24
head	24
and	24
the	24
whole	24
table	24
and	24
the	24
pedestal	24
of	24
jasper	24
on	24
which	24
it	24
stood,	24
and	24
then	24
said,	24
“This	24
head,	24
Señor	24
Don	24
Quixote,	24
has	24
been	24
made	24
and	24
fabricated	24
by	24
one	24
of	24
the	24
greatest	24
magicians	24
and	24
wizards	24
the	24
world	24
ever	24
saw,	24
a	24
Pole,	24
I	24
believe,	24
by	24
birth,	24
and	24
a	24
pupil	24
of	24
the	24
famous	24
Escotillo	24
of	24
whom	24
such	24
marvellous	24
stories	24
are	24
told.	24
He	24
was	24
here	24
in	24
my	24
house,	24
and	24
for	24
a	24
consideration	24
of	24
a	24
thousand	24
crowns	24
that	24
I	24
gave	24
him	24
he	24
constructed	24
this	24
head,	24
which	24
has	24
the	24
property	24
and	24
virtue	24
of	24
answering	24
whatever	24
questions	24
are	24
put	24
to	24
its	24
ear.	24
He	24
observed	24
the	24
points	24
of	24
the	24
compass,	24
he	24
traced	24
figures,	24
he	24
studied	24
the	24
stars,	24
he	24
watched	24
favourable	24
moments,	24
and	24
at	24
length	24
brought	24
it	24
to	24
the	24
perfection	24
we	24
shall	24
see	24
to-morrow,	24
for	24
on	24
Fridays	24
it	24
is	24
mute,	24
and	24
this	24
being	24
Friday	24
we	24
must	24
wait	24
till	24
the	24
next	24
day.	24
In	24
the	24
interval	24
your	24
worship	24
may	24
consider	24
what	24
you	24
would	24
like	24
to	24
ask	24
it;	24
and	24
I	24
know	24
by	24
experience	24
that	24
in	24
all	24
its	24
answers	24
it	24
tells	24
the	24
truth.”	24
Don	24
Quixote	24
was	24
amazed	24
at	24
the	24
virtue	24
and	24
property	24
of	24
the	24
head,	24
and	24
was	24
inclined	24
to	24
disbelieve	24
Don	24
Antonio;	24
but	24
seeing	24
what	24
a	24
short	24
time	24
he	24
had	24
to	24
wait	24
to	24
test	24
the	24
matter,	24
he	24
did	24
not	24
choose	24
to	24
say	24
anything	24
except	24
that	24
he	24
thanked	24
him	24
for	24
having	24
revealed	24
to	24
him	24
so	24
mighty	24
a	24
secret.	24
They	24
then	24
quitted	24
the	24
room,	24
Don	24
Antonio	24
locked	24
the	24
door,	24
and	24
they	24
repaired	24
to	24
the	24
chamber	24
where	24
the	24
rest	24
of	24
the	24
gentlemen	24
were	24
assembled.	24
In	24
the	24
meantime	24
Sancho	24
had	24
recounted	24
to	24
them	24
several	24
of	24
the	24
adventures	24
and	24
accidents	24
that	24
had	24
happened	24
his	24
master.	24
That	24
afternoon	24
they	24
took	24
Don	24
Quixote	24
out	24
for	24
a	24
stroll,	24
not	24
in	24
his	24
armour	24
but	24
in	24
street	24
costume,	24
with	24
a	24
surcoat	24
of	24
tawny	24
cloth	24
upon	24
him,	24
that	24
at	24
that	24
season	24
would	24
have	24
made	24
ice	24
itself	24
sweat.	24
Orders	24
were	24
left	24
with	24
the	24
servants	24
to	24
entertain	24
Sancho	24
so	24
as	24
not	24
to	24
let	24
him	24
leave	24
the	24
house.	24
Don	24
Quixote	24
was	24
mounted,	24
not	24
on	24
Rocinante,	24
but	24
upon	24
a	24
tall	24
mule	24
of	24
easy	24
pace	24
and	24
handsomely	24
caparisoned.	24
They	24
put	24
the	24
surcoat	24
on	24
him,	24
and	24
on	24
the	24
back,	24
without	24
his	24
perceiving	24
it,	24
they	24
stitched	24
a	24
parchment	24
on	24
which	24
they	24
wrote	24
in	24
large	24
letters,	24
“This	24
is	24
Don	24
Quixote	24
of	24
La	24
Mancha.”	24
As	24
they	24
set	24
out	24
upon	24
their	24
excursion	24
the	24
placard	24
attracted	24
the	24
eyes	24
of	24
all	24
who	24
chanced	24
to	24
see	24
him,	24
and	24
as	24
they	24
read	24
out,	24
“This	24
is	24
Don	24
Quixote	24
of	24
La	24
Mancha,”	24
Don	24
Quixote	24
was	24
amazed	24
to	24
see	24
how	24
many	24
people	24
gazed	24
at	24
him,	24
called	24
him	24
by	24
his	24
name,	24
and	24
recognised	24
him,	24
and	24
turning	24
to	24
Don	24
Antonio,	24
who	24
rode	24
at	24
his	24
side,	24
he	24
observed	24
to	24
him,	24
“Great	24
are	24
the	24
privileges	24
knight-errantry	24
involves,	24
for	24
it	24
makes	24
him	24
who	24
professes	24
it	24
known	24
and	24
famous	24
in	24
every	24
region	24
of	24
the	24
earth;	24
see,	24
Don	24
Antonio,	24
even	24
the	24
very	24
boys	24
of	24
this	24
city	24
know	24
me	24
without	24
ever	24
having	24
seen	24
me.”	24
“True,	24
Señor	24
Don	24
Quixote,”	24
returned	24
Don	24
Antonio;	24
“for	24
as	24
fire	24
cannot	24
be	24
hidden	24
or	24
kept	24
secret,	24
virtue	24
cannot	24
escape	24
being	24
recognised;	24
and	24
that	24
which	24
is	24
attained	24
by	24
the	24
profession	24
of	24
arms	24
shines	24
distinguished	24
above	24
all	24
others.”	24
It	24
came	24
to	24
pass,	24
however,	24
that	24
as	24
Don	24
Quixote	24
was	24
proceeding	24
amid	24
the	24
acclamations	24
that	24
have	24
been	24
described,	24
a	24
Castilian,	24
reading	24
the	24
inscription	24
on	24
his	24
back,	24
cried	24
out	24
in	24
a	24
loud	24
voice,	24
“The	24
devil	24
take	24
thee	24
for	24
a	24
Don	24
Quixote	24
of	24
La	24
Mancha!	24
What!	24
art	24
thou	24
here,	24
and	24
not	24
dead	24
of	24
the	24
countless	24
drubbings	24
that	24
have	24
fallen	24
on	24
thy	24
ribs?	24
Thou	24
art	24
mad;	24
and	24
if	24
thou	24
wert	24
so	24
by	24
thyself,	24
and	24
kept	24
thyself	24
within	24
thy	24
madness,	24
it	24
would	24
not	24
be	24
so	24
bad;	24
but	24
thou	24
hast	24
the	24
gift	24
of	24
making	24
fools	24
and	24
blockheads	24
of	24
all	24
who	24
have	24
anything	24
to	24
do	24
with	24
thee	24
or	24
say	24
to	24
thee.	24
Why,	24
look	24
at	24
these	24
gentlemen	24
bearing	24
thee	24
company!	24
Get	24
thee	24
home,	24
blockhead,	24
and	24
see	24
after	24
thy	24
affairs,	24
and	24
thy	24
wife	24
and	24
children,	24
and	24
give	24
over	24
these	24
fooleries	24
that	24
are	24
sapping	24
thy	24
brains	24
and	24
skimming	24
away	24
thy	24
wits.”	24
“Go	24
your	24
own	24
way,	24
brother,”	24
said	24
Don	24
Antonio,	24
“and	24
don’t	24
offer	24
advice	24
to	24
those	24
who	24
don’t	24
ask	24
you	24
for	24
it.	24
Señor	24
Don	24
Quixote	24
is	24
in	24
his	24
full	24
senses,	24
and	24
we	24
who	24
bear	24
him	24
company	24
are	24
not	24
fools;	24
virtue	24
is	24
to	24
be	24
honoured	24
wherever	24
it	24
may	24
be	24
found;	24
go,	24
and	24
bad	24
luck	24
to	24
you,	24
and	24
don’t	24
meddle	24
where	24
you	24
are	24
not	24
wanted.”	24
“By	24
God,	24
your	24
worship	24
is	24
right,”	24
replied	24
the	24
Castilian;	24
“for	24
to	24
advise	24
this	24
good	24
man	24
is	24
to	24
kick	24
against	24
the	24
pricks;	24
still	24
for	24
all	24
that	24
it	24
fills	24
me	24
with	24
pity	24
that	24
the	24
sound	24
wit	24
they	24
say	24
the	24
blockhead	24
has	24
in	24
everything	24
should	24
dribble	24
away	24
by	24
the	24
channel	24
of	24
his	24
knight-errantry;	24
but	24
may	24
the	24
bad	24
luck	24
your	24
worship	24
talks	24
of	24
follow	24
me	24
and	24
all	24
my	24
descendants,	24
if,	24
from	24
this	24
day	24
forth,	24
though	24
I	24
should	24
live	24
longer	24
than	24
Methuselah,	24
I	24
ever	24
give	24
advice	24
to	24
anybody	24
even	24
if	24
he	24
asks	24
me	24
for	24
it.”	24
The	24
advice-giver	24
took	24
himself	24
off,	24
and	24
they	24
continued	24
their	24
stroll;	24
but	24
so	24
great	24
was	24
the	24
press	24
of	24
the	24
boys	24
and	24
people	24
to	24
read	24
the	24
placard,	24
that	24
Don	24
Antonio	24
was	24
forced	24
to	24
remove	24
it	24
as	24
if	24
he	24
were	24
taking	24
off	24
something	24
else.	24

Night	24
came	24
and	24
they	24
went	24
home,	24
and	24
there	24
was	24
a	24
ladies’	24
dancing	24
party,	24
for	24
Don	24
Antonio’s	24
wife,	24
a	24
lady	24
of	24
rank	24
and	24
gaiety,	24
beauty	24
and	24
wit,	24
had	24
invited	24
some	24
friends	24
of	24
hers	24
to	24
come	24
and	24
do	24
honour	24
to	24
her	24
guest	24
and	24
amuse	24
themselves	24
with	24
his	24
strange	24
delusions.	24
Several	24
of	24
them	24
came,	24
they	24
supped	24
sumptuously,	24
the	24
dance	24
began	24
at	24
about	24
ten	24
o’clock.	24
Among	24
the	24
ladies	24
were	24
two	24
of	24
a	24
mischievous	24
and	24
frolicsome	24
turn,	24
and,	24
though	24
perfectly	24
modest,	24
somewhat	24
free	24
in	24
playing	24
tricks	24
for	24
harmless	24
diversion’s	24
sake.	24
These	24
two	24
were	24
so	24
indefatigable	24
in	24
taking	24
Don	24
Quixote	24
out	24
to	24
dance	24
that	24
they	24
tired	24
him	24
down,	24
not	24
only	24
in	24
body	24
but	24
in	24
spirit.	24
It	24
was	24
a	24
sight	24
to	24
see	24
the	24
figure	24
Don	24
Quixote	24
made,	24
long,	24
lank,	24
lean,	24
and	24
yellow,	24
his	24
garments	24
clinging	24
tight	24
to	24
him,	24
ungainly,	24
and	24
above	24
all	24
anything	24
but	24
agile.	24

The	24
gay	24
ladies	24
made	24
secret	24
love	24
to	24
him,	24
and	24
he	24
on	24
his	24
part	24
secretly	24
repelled	24
them,	24
but	24
finding	24
himself	24
hard	24
pressed	24
by	24
their	24
blandishments	24
he	24
lifted	24
up	24
his	24
voice	24
and	24
exclaimed,	24
“_Fugite,	24
partes	24
adversæ!_	24
Leave	24
me	24
in	24
peace,	24
unwelcome	24
overtures;	24
avaunt,	24
with	24
your	24
desires,	24
ladies,	24
for	24
she	24
who	24
is	24
queen	24
of	24
mine,	24
the	24
peerless	24
Dulcinea	24
del	24
Toboso,	24
suffers	24
none	24
but	24
hers	24
to	24
lead	24
me	24
captive	24
and	24
subdue	24
me;”	24
and	24
so	24
saying	24
he	24
sat	24
down	24
on	24
the	24
floor	24
in	24
the	24
middle	24
of	24
the	24
room,	24
tired	24
out	24
and	24
broken	24
down	24
by	24
all	24
this	24
exertion	24
in	24
the	24
dance.	24
Don	24
Antonio	24
directed	24
him	24
to	24
be	24
taken	24
up	24
bodily	24
and	24
carried	24
to	24
bed,	24
and	24
the	24
first	24
that	24
laid	24
hold	24
of	24
him	24
was	24
Sancho,	24
saying	24
as	24
he	24
did	24
so,	24
“In	24
an	24
evil	24
hour	24
you	24
took	24
to	24
dancing,	24
master	24
mine;	24
do	24
you	24
fancy	24
all	24
mighty	24
men	24
of	24
valour	24
are	24
dancers,	24
and	24
all	24
knights-errant	24
given	24
to	24
capering?	24
If	24
you	24
do,	24
I	24
can	24
tell	24
you	25
are	25
mistaken;	25
there’s	25
many	25
a	25
man	25
would	25
rather	25
undertake	25
to	25
kill	25
a	25
giant	25
than	25
cut	25
a	25
caper.	25
If	25
it	25
had	25
been	25
the	25
shoe-fling	25
you	25
were	25
at	25
I	25
could	25
take	25
your	25
place,	25
for	25
I	25
can	25
do	25
the	25
shoe-fling	25
like	25
a	25
gerfalcon;	25
but	25
I’m	25
no	25
good	25
at	25
dancing.”	25
With	25
these	25
and	25
other	25
observations	25
Sancho	25
set	25
the	25
whole	25
ball-room	25
laughing,	25
and	25
then	25
put	25
his	25
master	25
to	25
bed,	25
covering	25
him	25
up	25
well	25
so	25
that	25
he	25
might	25
sweat	25
out	25
any	25
chill	25
caught	25
after	25
his	25
dancing.	25
The	25
next	25
day	25
Don	25
Antonio	25
thought	25
he	25
might	25
as	25
well	25
make	25
trial	25
of	25
the	25
enchanted	25
head,	25
and	25
with	25
Don	25
Quixote,	25
Sancho,	25
and	25
two	25
others,	25
friends	25
of	25
his,	25
besides	25
the	25
two	25
ladies	25
that	25
had	25
tired	25
out	25
Don	25
Quixote	25
at	25
the	25
ball,	25
who	25
had	25
remained	25
for	25
the	25
night	25
with	25
Don	25
Antonio’s	25
wife,	25
he	25
locked	25
himself	25
up	25
in	25
the	25
chamber	25
where	25
the	25
head	25
was.	25
He	25
explained	25
to	25
them	25
the	25
property	25
it	25
possessed	25
and	25
entrusted	25
the	25
secret	25
to	25
them,	25
telling	25
them	25
that	25
now	25
for	25
the	25
first	25
time	25
he	25
was	25
going	25
to	25
try	25
the	25
virtue	25
of	25
the	25
enchanted	25
head;	25
but	25
except	25
Don	25
Antonio’s	25
two	25
friends	25
no	25
one	25
else	25
was	25
privy	25
to	25
the	25
mystery	25
of	25
the	25
enchantment,	25
and	25
if	25
Don	25
Antonio	25
had	25
not	25
first	25
revealed	25
it	25
to	25
them	25
they	25
would	25
have	25
been	25
inevitably	25
reduced	25
to	25
the	25
same	25
state	25
of	25
amazement	25
as	25
the	25
rest,	25
so	25
artfully	25
and	25
skilfully	25
was	25
it	25
contrived.	25
The	25
first	25
to	25
approach	25
the	25
ear	25
of	25
the	25
head	25
was	25
Don	25
Antonio	25
himself,	25
and	25
in	25
a	25
low	25
voice	25
but	25
not	25
so	25
low	25
as	25
not	25
to	25
be	25
audible	25
to	25
all,	25
he	25
said	25
to	25
it,	25
“Head,	25
tell	25
me	25
by	25
the	25
virtue	25
that	25
lies	25
in	25
thee	25
what	25
am	25
I	25
at	25
this	25
moment	25
thinking	25
of?”	25
The	25
head,	25
without	25
any	25
movement	25
of	25
the	25
lips,	25
answered	25
in	25
a	25
clear	25
and	25
distinct	25
voice,	25
so	25
as	25
to	25
be	25
heard	25
by	25
all,	25
“I	25
cannot	25
judge	25
of	25
thoughts.”	25
All	25
were	25
thunderstruck	25
at	25
this,	25
and	25
all	25
the	25
more	25
so	25
as	25
they	25
saw	25
that	25
there	25
was	25
nobody	25
anywhere	25
near	25
the	25
table	25
or	25
in	25
the	25
whole	25
room	25
that	25
could	25
have	25
answered.	25
“How	25
many	25
of	25
us	25
are	25
here?”	25
asked	25
Don	25
Antonio	25
once	25
more;	25
and	25
it	25
was	25
answered	25
him	25
in	25
the	25
same	25
way	25
softly,	25
“Thou	25
and	25
thy	25
wife,	25
with	25
two	25
friends	25
of	25
thine	25
and	25
two	25
of	25
hers,	25
and	25
a	25
famous	25
knight	25
called	25
Don	25
Quixote	25
of	25
La	25
Mancha,	25
and	25
a	25
squire	25
of	25
his,	25
Sancho	25
Panza	25
by	25
name.”	25
Now	25
there	25
was	25
fresh	25
astonishment;	25
now	25
everyone’s	25
hair	25
was	25
standing	25
on	25
end	25
with	25
awe;	25
and	25
Don	25
Antonio	25
retiring	25
from	25
the	25
head	25
exclaimed,	25
“This	25
suffices	25
to	25
show	25
me	25
that	25
I	25
have	25
not	25
been	25
deceived	25
by	25
him	25
who	25
sold	25
thee	25
to	25
me,	25
O	25
sage	25
head,	25
talking	25
head,	25
answering	25
head,	25
wonderful	25
head!	25
Let	25
someone	25
else	25
go	25
and	25
put	25
what	25
question	25
he	25
likes	25
to	25
it.”	25
And	25
as	25
women	25
are	25
commonly	25
impulsive	25
and	25
inquisitive,	25
the	25
first	25
to	25
come	25
forward	25
was	25
one	25
of	25
the	25
two	25
friends	25
of	25
Don	25
Antonio’s	25
wife,	25
and	25
her	25
question	25
was,	25
“Tell	25
me,	25
Head,	25
what	25
shall	25
I	25
do	25
to	25
be	25
very	25
beautiful?”	25
and	25
the	25
answer	25
she	25
got	25
was,	25
“Be	25
very	25
modest.”	25
“I	25
question	25
thee	25
no	25
further,”	25
said	25
the	25
fair	25
querist.	25
Her	25
companion	25
then	25
came	25
up	25
and	25
said,	25
“I	25
should	25
like	25
to	25
know,	25
Head,	25
whether	25
my	25
husband	25
loves	25
me	25
or	25
not;”	25
the	25
answer	25
given	25
to	25
her	25
was,	25
“Think	25
how	25
he	25
uses	25
thee,	25
and	25
thou	25
mayest	25
guess;”	25
and	25
the	25
married	25
lady	25
went	25
off	25
saying,	25
“That	25
answer	25
did	25
not	25
need	25
a	25
question;	25
for	25
of	25
course	25
the	25
treatment	25
one	25
receives	25
shows	25
the	25
disposition	25
of	25
him	25
from	25
whom	25
it	25
is	25
received.”	25
Then	25
one	25
of	25
Don	25
Antonio’s	25
two	25
friends	25
advanced	25
and	25
asked	25
it,	25
“Who	25
am	25
I?”	25
“Thou	25
knowest,”	25
was	25
the	25
answer.	25
“That	25
is	25
not	25
what	25
I	25
ask	25
thee,”	25
said	25
the	25
gentleman,	25
“but	25
to	25
tell	25
me	25
if	25
thou	25
knowest	25
me.”	25
“Yes,	25
I	25
know	25
thee,	25
thou	25
art	25
Don	25
Pedro	25
Noriz,”	25
was	25
the	25
reply.	25
“I	25
do	25
not	25
seek	25
to	25
know	25
more,”	25
said	25
the	25
gentleman,	25
“for	25
this	25
is	25
enough	25
to	25
convince	25
me,	25
O	25
Head,	25
that	25
thou	25
knowest	25
everything;”	25
and	25
as	25
he	25
retired	25
the	25
other	25
friend	25
came	25
forward	25
and	25
asked	25
it,	25
“Tell	25
me,	25
Head,	25
what	25
are	25
the	25
wishes	25
of	25
my	25
eldest	25
son?”	25
“I	25
have	25
said	25
already,”	25
was	25
the	25
answer,	25
“that	25
I	25
cannot	25
judge	25
of	25
wishes;	25
however,	25
I	25
can	25
tell	25
thee	25
the	25
wish	25
of	25
thy	25
son	25
is	25
to	25
bury	25
thee.”	25
“That’s	25
‘what	25
I	25
see	25
with	25
my	25
eyes	25
I	25
point	25
out	25
with	25
my	25
finger,’”	25
said	25
the	25
gentleman,	25
“so	25
I	25
ask	25
no	25
more.”	25
Don	25
Antonio’s	25
wife	25
came	25
up	25
and	25
said,	25
“I	25
know	25
not	25
what	25
to	25
ask	25
thee,	25
Head;	25
I	25
would	25
only	25
seek	25
to	25
know	25
of	25
thee	25
if	25
I	25
shall	25
have	25
many	25
years	25
of	25
enjoyment	25
of	25
my	25
good	25
husband;”	25
and	25
the	25
answer	25
she	25
received	25
was,	25
“Thou	25
shalt,	25
for	25
his	25
vigour	25
and	25
his	25
temperate	25
habits	25
promise	25
many	25
years	25
of	25
life,	25
which	25
by	25
their	25
intemperance	25
others	25
so	25
often	25
cut	25
short.”	25
Then	25
Don	25
Quixote	25
came	25
forward	25
and	25
said,	25
“Tell	25
me,	25
thou	25
that	25
answerest,	25
was	25
that	25
which	25
I	25
describe	25
as	25
having	25
happened	25
to	25
me	25
in	25
the	25
cave	25
of	25
Montesinos	25
the	25
truth	25
or	25
a	25
dream?	25
Will	25
Sancho’s	25
whipping	25
be	25
accomplished	25
without	25
fail?	25
Will	25
the	25
disenchantment	25
of	25
Dulcinea	25
be	25
brought	25
about?”	25

“As	25
to	25
the	25
question	25
of	25
the	25
cave,”	25
was	25
the	25
reply,	25
“there	25
is	25
much	25
to	25
be	25
said;	25
there	25
is	25
something	25
of	25
both	25
in	25
it.	25
Sancho’s	25
whipping	25
will	25
proceed	25
leisurely.	25
The	25
disenchantment	25
of	25
Dulcinea	25
will	25
attain	25
its	25
due	25
consummation.”	25
“I	25
seek	25
to	25
know	25
no	25
more,”	25
said	25
Don	25
Quixote;	25
“let	25
me	25
but	25
see	25
Dulcinea	25
disenchanted,	25
and	25
I	25
will	25
consider	25
that	25
all	25
the	25
good	25
fortune	25
I	25
could	25
wish	25
for	25
has	25
come	25
upon	25
me	25
all	25
at	25
once.”	25
The	25
last	25
questioner	25
was	25
Sancho,	25
and	25
his	25
questions	25
were,	25
“Head,	25
shall	25
I	25
by	25
any	25
chance	25
have	25
another	25
government?	25
Shall	25
I	25
ever	25
escape	25
from	25
the	25
hard	25
life	25
of	25
a	25
squire?	25
Shall	25
I	25
get	25
back	25
to	25
see	25
my	25
wife	25
and	25
children?”	25
To	25
which	25
the	25
answer	25
came,	25
“Thou	25
shalt	25
govern	25
in	25
thy	25
house;	25
and	25
if	25
thou	25
returnest	25
to	25
it	25
thou	25
shalt	25
see	25
thy	25
wife	25
and	25
children;	25
and	25
on	25
ceasing	25
to	25
serve	25
thou	25
shalt	25
cease	25
to	25
be	25
a	25
squire.”	25
“Good,	25
by	25
God!”	25
said	25
Sancho	25
Panza;	25
“I	25
could	25
have	25
told	25
myself	25
that;	25
the	25
prophet	25
Perogrullo	25
could	25
have	25
said	25
no	25
more.”	25
“What	25
answer	25
wouldst	25
thou	25
have,	25
beast?”	25
said	25
Don	25
Quixote;	25
“is	25
it	25
not	25
enough	25
that	25
the	25
replies	25
this	25
head	25
has	25
given	25
suit	25
the	25
questions	25
put	25
to	25
it?”	25
“Yes,	25
it	25
is	25
enough,”	25
said	25
Sancho;	25
“but	25
I	25
should	25
have	25
liked	25
it	25
to	25
have	25
made	25
itself	25
plainer	25
and	25
told	25
me	25
more.”	25
The	25
questions	25
and	25
answers	25
came	25
to	25
an	25
end	25
here,	25
but	25
not	25
the	25
wonder	25
with	25
which	25
all	25
were	25
filled,	25
except	25
Don	25
Antonio’s	25
two	25
friends	25
who	25
were	25
in	25
the	25
secret.	25
This	25
Cide	25
Hamete	25
Benengeli	25
thought	25
fit	25
to	25
reveal	25
at	25
once,	25
not	25
to	25
keep	25
the	25
world	25
in	25
suspense,	25
fancying	25
that	25
the	25
head	25
had	25
some	25
strange	25
magical	25
mystery	25
in	25
it.	25
He	25
says,	25
therefore,	25
that	25
on	25
the	25
model	25
of	25
another	25
head,	25
the	25
work	25
of	25
an	25
image	25
maker,	25
which	25
he	25
had	25
seen	25
at	25
Madrid,	25
Don	25
Antonio	25
made	25
this	25
one	25
at	25
home	25
for	25
his	25
own	25
amusement	25
and	25
to	25
astonish	25
ignorant	25
people;	25
and	25
its	25
mechanism	25
was	25
as	25
follows.	25
The	25
table	25
was	25
of	25
wood	25
painted	25
and	25
varnished	25
to	25
imitate	25
jasper,	25
and	25
the	25
pedestal	25
on	25
which	25
it	25
stood	25
was	25
of	25
the	25
same	25
material,	25
with	25
four	25
eagles’	25
claws	25
projecting	25
from	25
it	25
to	25
support	25
the	25
weight	25
more	25
steadily.	25
The	25
head,	25
which	25
resembled	25
a	25
bust	25
or	25
figure	25
of	25
a	25
Roman	25
emperor,	25
and	25
was	25
coloured	25
like	25
bronze,	25
was	25
hollow	25
throughout,	25
as	25
was	25
the	25
table,	25
into	25
which	25
it	25
was	25
fitted	25
so	25
exactly	25
that	25
no	25
trace	25
of	25
the	25
joining	25
was	25
visible.	25
The	25
pedestal	25
of	25
the	25
table	25
was	25
also	25
hollow	25
and	25
communicated	25
with	25
the	25
throat	25
and	25
neck	25
of	25
the	25
head,	25
and	25
the	25
whole	25
was	25
in	25
communication	25
with	25
another	25
room	25
underneath	25
the	25
chamber	25
in	25
which	25
the	25
head	25
stood.	25
Through	25
the	25
entire	25
cavity	25
in	25
the	25
pedestal,	25
table,	25
throat	25
and	25
neck	25
of	25
the	25
bust	25
or	25
figure,	25
there	25
passed	25
a	25
tube	25
of	25
tin	25
carefully	25
adjusted	25
and	25
concealed	25
from	25
sight.	25
In	25
the	25
room	25
below	25
corresponding	25
to	25
the	25
one	25
above	25
was	25
placed	25
the	25
person	25
who	25
was	25
to	25
answer,	25
with	25
his	25
mouth	25
to	25
the	25
tube,	25
and	25
the	25
voice,	25
as	25
in	25
an	25
ear-trumpet,	25
passed	25
from	25
above	25
downwards,	25
and	25
from	25
below	25
upwards,	25
the	25
words	25
coming	25
clearly	25
and	25
distinctly;	25
it	25
was	25
impossible,	25
thus,	25
to	25
detect	25
the	25
trick.	25
A	25
nephew	25
of	25
Don	25
Antonio’s,	25
a	25
smart	25
sharp-witted	25
student,	25
was	25
the	25
answerer,	25
and	25
as	25
he	25
had	25
been	25
told	25
beforehand	25
by	25
his	25
uncle	25
who	25
the	25
persons	25
were	25
that	25
would	25
come	25
with	25
him	25
that	25
day	25
into	25
the	25
chamber	25
where	25
the	25
head	25
was,	25
it	25
was	25
an	25
easy	25
matter	25
for	25
him	25
to	25
answer	25
the	25
first	25
question	25
at	25
once	25
and	25
correctly;	25
the	25
others	25
he	25
answered	25
by	25
guess-work,	25
and,	25
being	25
clever,	25
cleverly.	25
Cide	25
Hamete	25
adds	25
that	25
this	25
marvellous	25
contrivance	25
stood	25
for	25
some	25
ten	25
or	25
twelve	25
days;	25
but	25
that,	25
as	25
it	25
became	25
noised	25
abroad	25
through	25
the	25
city	25
that	25
he	25
had	25
in	25
his	25
house	25
an	25
enchanted	25
head	25
that	25
answered	25
all	25
who	25
asked	25
questions	25
of	25
it,	25
Don	25
Antonio,	25
fearing	25
it	25
might	25
come	25
to	25
the	25
ears	25
of	25
the	25
watchful	25
sentinels	25
of	25
our	25
faith,	25
explained	25
the	25
matter	25
to	25
the	25
inquisitors,	25
who	25
commanded	25
him	25
to	25
break	25
it	25
up	25
and	25
have	25
done	25
with	25
it,	25
lest	25
the	25
ignorant	25
vulgar	25
should	25
be	25
scandalised.	25
By	25
Don	25
Quixote,	25
however,	25
and	25
by	25
Sancho	25
the	25
head	25
was	25
still	25
held	25
to	25
be	25
an	25
enchanted	25
one,	25
and	25
capable	25
of	25
answering	25
questions,	25
though	25
more	25
to	25
Don	25
Quixote’s	25
satisfaction	25
than	25
Sancho’s.	25
The	25
gentlemen	25
of	25
the	25
city,	25
to	25
gratify	25
Don	25
Antonio	25
and	25
also	25
to	25
do	25
the	25
honours	25
to	25
Don	25
Quixote,	25
and	25
give	25
him	25
an	25
opportunity	25
of	25
displaying	25
his	25
folly,	25
made	25
arrangements	25
for	25
a	25
tilting	25
at	25
the	25
ring	25
in	25
six	25
days	25
from	25
that	25
time,	25
which,	25
however,	25
for	25
reason	25
that	25
will	25
be	25
mentioned	25
hereafter,	25
did	25
not	25
take	25
place.	25
Don	25
Quixote	25
took	25
a	25
fancy	25
to	25
stroll	25
about	25
the	25
city	25
quietly	25
and	25
on	25
foot,	25
for	25
he	25
feared	25
that	25
if	25
he	25
went	25
on	25
horseback	25
the	25
boys	25
would	25
follow	25
him;	25
so	25
he	25
and	25
Sancho	25
and	25
two	25
servants	25
that	25
Don	25
Antonio	25
gave	25
him	25
set	25
out	25
for	25
a	25
walk.	25
Thus	25
it	25
came	25
to	25
pass	25
that	25
going	25
along	25
one	25
of	25
the	25
streets	25
Don	25
Quixote	25
lifted	25
up	25
his	25
eyes	25
and	25
saw	25
written	25
in	25
very	25
large	25
letters	25
over	25
a	25
door,	25
“Books	25
printed	25
here,”	25
at	25
which	25
he	25
was	25
vastly	25
pleased,	25
for	25
until	25
then	25
he	25
had	25
never	25
seen	25
a	25
printing	25
office,	25
and	25
he	25
was	25
curious	25
to	25
know	25
what	25
it	25
was	25
like.	25
He	25
entered	25
with	25
all	25
his	25
following,	25
and	25
saw	25
them	25
drawing	25
sheets	25
in	25
one	25
place,	25
correcting	25
in	25
another,	25
setting	25
up	25
type	25
here,	25
revising	25
there;	25
in	25
short	25
all	25
the	25
work	25
that	25
is	25
to	25
be	25
seen	25
in	25
great	25
printing	25
offices.	25
He	25
went	25
up	25
to	25
one	25
case	25
and	25
asked	25
what	25
they	25
were	25
about	25
there;	25
the	25
workmen	25
told	25
him,	25
he	25
watched	25
them	25
with	25
wonder,	25
and	25
passed	25
on.	25
He	25
approached	25
one	25
man,	25
among	25
others,	25
and	25
asked	25
him	25
what	25
he	25
was	25
doing.	25
The	25
workman	25
replied,	25
“Señor,	25
this	25
gentleman	25
here”	25
(pointing	25
to	25
a	25
man	25
of	25
prepossessing	25
appearance	25
and	25
a	25
certain	25
gravity	25
of	25
look)	25
“has	25
translated	25
an	25
Italian	25
book	25
into	25
our	25
Spanish	25
tongue,	25
and	25
I	25
am	25
setting	25
it	25
up	25
in	25
type	25
for	25
the	25
press.”	25
“What	25
is	25
the	25
title	25
of	25
the	25
book?”	25
asked	25
Don	25
Quixote;	25
to	25
which	25
the	25
author	25
replied,	25
“Señor,	25
in	25
Italian	25
the	25
book	25
is	25
called	25
_Le	25
Bagatelle_.”	25
“And	25
what	25
does	25
_Le	25
Bagatelle_	25
import	25
in	25
our	25
Spanish?”	25
asked	25
Don	25
Quixote.	25
“_Le	25
Bagatelle_,”	25
said	25
the	25
author,	25
“is	25
as	25
though	25
we	25
should	25
say	25
in	25
Spanish	25
_Los	25
Juguetes;_	25
but	25
though	25
the	25
book	25
is	25
humble	25
in	25
name	25
it	25
has	25
good	25
solid	25
matter	25
in	25
it.”	25
“I,”	25
said	25
Don	25
Quixote,	25
“have	25
some	25
little	25
smattering	25
of	25
Italian,	25
and	25
I	25
plume	25
myself	25
on	25
singing	25
some	25
of	25
Ariosto’s	25
stanzas;	25
but	25
tell	25
me,	25
señor—I	25
do	25
not	25
say	25
this	25
to	25
test	25
your	25
ability,	25
but	25
merely	25
out	25
of	25
curiosity—have	25
you	25
ever	25
met	25
with	25
the	25
word	25
_pignatta_	25
in	25
your	25
book?”	25
“Yes,	25
often,”	25
said	25
the	25
author.	25
“And	25
how	25
do	25
you	25
render	25
that	25
in	25
Spanish?”	25
“How	25
should	25
I	25
render	25
it,”	25
returned	25
the	25
author,	25
“but	25
by	25
_olla_?”	25
“Body	25
o’	25
me,”	25
exclaimed	25
Don	25
Quixote,	25
“what	25
a	25
proficient	25
you	25
are	25
in	25
the	25
Italian	25
language!	25
I	25
would	25
lay	25
a	25
good	25
wager	25
that	25
where	25
they	25
say	25
in	25
Italian	25
_piace_	25
you	25
say	25
in	25
Spanish	25
_place_,	25
and	25
where	25
they	25
say	25
_piu_	25
you	25
say	25
_mas_,	25
and	25
you	25
translate	25
_sù_	25
by	25
_arriba_	25
and	25
_giù_	25
by	25
_abajo_.”	25
“I	25
translate	25
them	25
so	25
of	25
course,”	25
said	25
the	25
author,	25
“for	25
those	25
are	25
their	25
proper	25
equivalents.”	25
“I	25
would	25
venture	25
to	25
swear,”	25
said	25
Don	25
Quixote,	25
“that	25
your	25
worship	25
is	25
not	25
known	25
in	25
the	25
world,	25
which	25
always	25
begrudges	25
their	25
reward	25
to	25
rare	25
wits	25
and	25
praiseworthy	25
labours.	25
What	25
talents	25
lie	25
wasted	25
there!	25
What	25
genius	25
thrust	25
away	25
into	25
corners!	25
What	25
worth	25
left	25
neglected!	25
Still	25
it	25
seems	25
to	25
me	25
that	25
translation	25
from	25
one	25
language	25
into	25
another,	25
if	25
it	25
be	25
not	25
from	25
the	25
queens	25
of	25
languages,	25
the	25
Greek	25
and	25
the	25
Latin,	25
is	25
like	25
looking	25
at	25
Flemish	25
tapestries	25
on	25
the	25
wrong	25
side;	25
for	25
though	25
the	25
figures	25
are	25
visible,	25
they	25
are	25
full	25
of	25
threads	25
that	25
make	25
them	25
indistinct,	25
and	25
they	25
do	25
not	25
show	25
with	25
the	25
smoothness	25
and	25
brightness	25
of	25
the	25
right	25
side;	25
and	25
translation	25
from	25
easy	25
languages	25
argues	25
neither	25
ingenuity	25
nor	25
command	25
of	25
words,	25
any	25
more	25
than	25
transcribing	25
or	25
copying	25
out	25
one	25
document	25
from	25
another.	25
But	25
I	25
do	25
not	25
mean	25
by	25
this	25
to	25
draw	25
the	25
inference	25
that	25
no	25
credit	25
is	25
to	25
be	25
allowed	25
for	25
the	25
work	25
of	25
translating,	25
for	25
a	25
man	25
may	25
employ	25
himself	25
in	25
ways	25
worse	25
and	25
less	25
profitable	25
to	25
himself.	25
This	25
estimate	25
does	25
not	25
include	25
two	25
famous	25
translators,	25
Doctor	25
Cristóbal	25
de	25
Figueroa,	25
in	25
his	25
_Pastor	25
Fido_,	25
and	25
Don	25
Juan	25
de	25
Jáuregui,	25
in	25
his	25
_Aminta_,	25
wherein	25
by	25
their	25
felicity	25
they	25
leave	25
it	25
in	25
doubt	25
which	25
is	25
the	25
translation	25
and	25
which	25
the	25
original.	25
But	25
tell	25
me,	25
are	25
you	25
printing	25
this	25
book	25
at	25
your	25
own	25
risk,	25
or	25
have	25
you	25
sold	25
the	25
copyright	25
to	25
some	25
bookseller?”	25
“I	25
print	25
at	25
my	25
own	25
risk,”	25
said	25
the	25
author,	25
“and	25
I	25
expect	25
to	25
make	25
a	25
thousand	25
ducats	25
at	25
least	25
by	25
this	25
first	25
edition,	25
which	25
is	25
to	25
be	25
of	25
two	25
thousand	25
copies	25
that	25
will	25
go	25
off	25
in	25
a	25
twinkling	25
at	25
six	25
reals	25
apiece.”	25
“A	25
fine	25
calculation	25
you	25
are	25
making!”	25
said	25
Don	25
Quixote;	25
“it	25
is	25
plain	25
you	25
don’t	25
know	25
the	25
ins	25
and	25
outs	25
of	25
the	25
printers,	25
and	25
how	25
they	25
play	25
into	25
one	25
another’s	25
hands.	25
I	25
promise	25
you	25
when	25
you	25
find	25
yourself	25
saddled	25
with	25
two	25
thousand	25
copies	25
you	25
will	25
feel	25
so	25
sore	25
that	25
it	25
will	25
astonish	25
you,	25
particularly	25
if	25
the	25
book	25
is	25
a	25
little	25
out	25
of	25
the	25
common	25
and	25
not	25
in	25
any	25
way	25
highly	25
spiced.”	25
“What!”	25
said	25
the	25
author,	25
“would	25
your	25
worship,	25
then,	25
have	25
me	25
give	25
it	25
to	25
a	25
bookseller	25
who	25
will	25
give	25
three	25
maravedis	25
for	25
the	25
copyright	25
and	25
think	25
he	25
is	25
doing	25
me	25
a	25
favour?	25
I	25
do	25
not	25
print	25
my	25
books	25
to	25
win	25
fame	25
in	25
the	25
world,	25
for	25
I	25
am	25
known	25
in	25
it	25
already	25
by	25
my	25
works;	25
I	25
want	25
to	25
make	25
money,	25
without	25
which	25
reputation	25
is	25
not	25
worth	25
a	25
rap.”	25
“God	25
send	25
your	25
worship	25
good	25
luck,”	25
said	25
Don	25
Quixote;	25
and	25
he	25
moved	25
on	25
to	25
another	25
case,	25
where	25
he	25
saw	25
them	25
correcting	25
a	25
sheet	25
of	25
a	25
book	25
with	25
the	25
title	25
of	25
“Light	25
of	25
the	25
Soul;”	25
noticing	25
it	25
he	25
observed,	25
“Books	25
like	25
this,	25
though	25
there	25
are	25
many	25
of	25
the	25
kind,	25
are	25
the	25
ones	25
that	25
deserve	25
to	25
be	25
printed,	25
for	25
many	25
are	25
the	25
sinners	25
in	25
these	25
days,	25
and	25
lights	25
unnumbered	25
are	25
needed	25
for	25
all	25
that	25
are	25
in	25
darkness.”	25
He	25
passed	25
on,	25
and	25
saw	25
they	25
were	25
also	25
correcting	25
another	25
book,	25
and	25
when	25
he	25
asked	25
its	25
title	25
they	25
told	25
him	25
it	25
was	25
called,	25
“The	25
Second	25
Part	25
of	25
the	25
Ingenious	25
Gentleman	25
Don	25
Quixote	25
of	25
La	25
Mancha,”	25
by	25
one	25
of	25
Tordesillas.	25
“I	25
have	25
heard	25
of	25
this	25
book	25
already,”	25
said	25
Don	25
Quixote,	25
“and	25
verily	25
and	25
on	25
my	25
conscience	25
I	25
thought	25
it	25
had	25
been	25
by	25
this	25
time	25
burned	25
to	25
ashes	25
as	25
a	25
meddlesome	25
intruder;	25
but	25
its	25
Martinmas	25
will	25
come	25
to	25
it	25
as	25
it	25
does	25
to	25
every	25
pig;	25
for	25
fictions	25
have	25
the	25
more	25
merit	25
and	25
charm	25
about	25
them	25
the	25
more	25
nearly	25
they	25
approach	25
the	25
truth	25
or	25
what	25
looks	25
like	25
it;	25
and	25
true	25
stories,	25
the	25
truer	25
they	25
are	25
the	25
better	25
they	25
are;”	25
and	25
so	25
saying	25
he	25
walked	25
out	25
of	25
the	25
printing	25
office	25
with	25
a	25
certain	25
amount	25
of	25
displeasure	25
in	25
his	25
looks.	25
That	25
same	25
day	25
Don	25
Antonio	25
arranged	25
to	25
take	25
him	25
to	25
see	25
the	25
galleys	25
that	25
lay	25
at	25
the	25
beach,	25
whereat	25
Sancho	25
was	25
in	25
high	25
delight,	25
as	25
he	25
had	25
never	25
seen	25
any	25
all	25
his	25
life.	25
Don	25
Antonio	25
sent	25
word	25
to	25
the	25
commandant	25
of	25
the	25
galleys	25
that	25
he	25
intended	25
to	25
bring	25
his	25
guest,	25
the	25
famous	25
Don	25
Quixote	25
of	25
La	25
Mancha,	25
of	25
whom	25
the	25
commandant	25
and	25
all	25
the	25
citizens	25
had	25
already	25
heard,	25
that	25
afternoon	25
to	25
see	25
them;	25
and	25
what	25
happened	25
on	25
board	25
of	25
them	25
will	25
be	25
told	25
in	25
the	25
next	25
chapter.	25

Full	25

Profound	25
were	25
Don	25
Quixote’s	25
reflections	25
on	25
the	25
reply	25
of	25
the	25
enchanted	25
head,	25
not	25
one	25
of	25
them,	25
however,	25
hitting	25
on	25
the	25
secret	25
of	25
the	25
trick,	25
but	25
all	25
concentrated	25
on	25
the	25
promise,	25
which	25
he	25
regarded	25
as	25
a	25
certainty,	25
of	25
Dulcinea’s	25
disenchantment.	25
This	25
he	25
turned	25
over	25
in	25
his	25
mind	25
again	25
and	25
again	25
with	25
great	25
satisfaction,	25
fully	25
persuaded	25
that	25
he	25
would	25
shortly	25
see	25
its	25
fulfillment;	25
and	25
as	25
for	25
Sancho,	25
though,	25
as	25
has	25
been	25
said,	25
he	25
hated	25
being	25
a	25
governor,	25
still	25
he	25
had	25
a	25
longing	25
to	25
be	25
giving	25
orders	25
and	25
finding	25
himself	25
obeyed	25
once	25
more;	25
this	25
is	25
the	25
misfortune	25
that	25
being	25
in	25
authority,	25
even	25
in	25
jest,	25
brings	25
with	25
it.	25
To	25
resume;	25
that	25
afternoon	25
their	25
host	25
Don	25
Antonio	25
Moreno	25
and	25
his	25
two	25
friends,	25
with	25
Don	25
Quixote	25
and	25
Sancho,	25
went	25
to	25
the	25
galleys.	25
The	25
commandant	25
had	25
been	25
already	25
made	25
aware	25
of	25
his	25
good	25
fortune	25
in	25
seeing	25
two	25
such	25
famous	25
persons	25
as	25
Don	25
Quixote	25
and	25
Sancho,	25
and	25
the	25
instant	25
they	25
came	25
to	25
the	25
shore	25
all	25
the	25
galleys	25
struck	25
their	25
awnings	25
and	25
the	25
clarions	25
rang	25
out.	25
A	25
skiff	25
covered	25
with	25
rich	25
carpets	25
and	25
cushions	25
of	25
crimson	25
velvet	25
was	25
immediately	25
lowered	25
into	25
the	25
water,	25
and	25
as	25
Don	25
Quixote	25
stepped	25
on	25
board	25
of	25
it,	25
the	25
leading	25
galley	25
fired	25
her	25
gangway	25
gun,	25
and	25
the	25
other	25
galleys	25
did	25
the	25
same;	25
and	25
as	25
he	25
mounted	25
the	25
starboard	25
ladder	25
the	25
whole	25
crew	25
saluted	25
him	25
(as	25
is	25
the	25
custom	25
when	25
a	25
personage	25
of	25
distinction	25
comes	25
on	25
board	25
a	25
galley)	25
by	25
exclaiming	25
“Hu,	25
hu,	25
hu,”	25
three	25
times.	25
The	25
general,	25
for	25
so	25
we	25
shall	25
call	25
him,	25
a	25
Valencian	25
gentleman	25
of	25
rank,	25
gave	25
him	25
his	25
hand	25
and	25
embraced	25
him,	25
saying,	25
“I	25
shall	25
mark	25
this	25
day	25
with	25
a	25
white	25
stone	25
as	25
one	25
of	25
the	25
happiest	25
I	25
can	25
expect	25
to	25
enjoy	25
in	25
my	25
lifetime,	25
since	25
I	25
have	25
seen	25
Señor	25
Don	25
Quixote	25
of	25
La	25
Mancha,	25
pattern	25
and	25
image	25
wherein	25
we	25
see	25
contained	25
and	25
condensed	25
all	25
that	25
is	25
worthy	25
in	25
knight-errantry.”	25
Don	25
Quixote	25
delighted	25
beyond	25
measure	25
with	25
such	25
a	25
lordly	25
reception,	25
replied	25
to	25
him	25
in	25
words	25
no	25
less	25
courteous.	25
All	25
then	25
proceeded	25
to	25
the	25
poop,	25
which	25
was	25
very	25
handsomely	25
decorated,	25
and	25
seated	25
themselves	25
on	25
the	25
bulwark	25
benches;	25
the	25
boatswain	25
passed	25
along	25
the	25
gangway	25
and	25
piped	25
all	25
hands	25
to	25
strip,	25
which	25
they	25
did	25
in	25
an	25
instant.	25
Sancho,	25
seeing	25
such	25
a	25
number	25
of	25
men	25
stripped	25
to	25
the	25
skin,	25
was	25
taken	25
aback,	25
and	25
still	25
more	25
when	25
he	25
saw	25
them	25
spread	25
the	25
awning	25
so	25
briskly	25
that	25
it	25
seemed	25
to	25
him	25
as	25
if	25
all	25
the	25
devils	25
were	25
at	25
work	25
at	25
it;	25
but	25
all	25
this	25
was	25
cakes	25
and	25
fancy	25
bread	25
to	25
what	25
I	25
am	25
going	25
to	25
tell	25
now.	25
Sancho	25
was	25
seated	25
on	25
the	25
captain’s	25
stage,	25
close	25
to	25
the	25
aftermost	25
rower	25
on	25
the	25
right-hand	25
side.	25
He,	25
previously	25
instructed	25
in	25
what	25
he	25
was	25
to	25
do,	25
laid	25
hold	25
of	25
Sancho,	25
hoisting	25
him	25
up	25
in	25
his	25
arms,	25
and	25
the	25
whole	25
crew,	25
who	25
were	25
standing	25
ready,	25
beginning	25
on	25
the	25
right,	25
proceeded	25
to	25
pass	25
him	25
on,	25
whirling	25
him	25
along	25
from	25
hand	25
to	25
hand	25
and	25
from	25
bench	25
to	25
bench	25
with	25
such	25
rapidity	25
that	25
it	25
took	25
the	25
sight	25
out	25
of	25
poor	25
Sancho’s	25
eyes,	25
and	25
he	25
made	25
quite	25
sure	25
that	25
the	25
devils	25
themselves	25
were	25
flying	25
away	25
with	25
him;	25
nor	25
did	25
they	25
leave	25
off	25
with	25
him	25
until	25
they	25
had	25
sent	25
him	25
back	25
along	25
the	25
left	25
side	25
and	25
deposited	25
him	25
on	25
the	25
poop;	25
and	25
the	25
poor	25
fellow	25
was	25
left	25
bruised	25
and	25
breathless	25
and	25
all	25
in	25
a	25
sweat,	25
and	25
unable	25
to	25
comprehend	25
what	25
it	25
was	25
that	25
had	25
happened	25
to	25
him.	25
Don	25
Quixote	25
when	25
he	25
saw	25
Sancho’s	25
flight	25
without	25
wings	25
asked	25
the	25
general	25
if	25
this	25
was	25
a	25
usual	25
ceremony	25
with	25
those	25
who	25
came	25
on	25
board	25
the	25
galleys	25
for	25
the	25
first	25
time;	25
for,	25
if	25
so,	25
as	25
he	25
had	25
no	25
intention	25
of	25
adopting	25
them	25
as	25
a	25
profession,	25
he	25
had	25
no	25
mind	25
to	25
perform	25
such	25
feats	25
of	25
agility,	25
and	25
if	25
anyone	25
offered	25
to	25
lay	25
hold	25
of	25
him	25
to	25
whirl	25
him	25
about,	25
he	25
vowed	25
to	25
God	25
he	25
would	25
kick	25
his	25
soul	25
out;	25
and	25
as	25
he	25
said	25
this	25
he	25
stood	25
up	25
and	25
clapped	25
his	25
hand	25
upon	25
his	25
sword.	25
At	25
this	25
instant	25
they	25
struck	25
the	25
awning	25
and	25
lowered	25
the	25
yard	25
with	25
a	25
prodigious	25
rattle.	25
Sancho	25
thought	25
heaven	25
was	25
coming	25
off	25
its	25
hinges	25
and	25
going	25
to	25
fall	25
on	25
his	25
head,	25
and	25
full	25
of	25
terror	25
he	25
ducked	25
it	25
and	25
buried	25
it	25
between	25
his	25
knees;	25
nor	25
were	25
Don	25
Quixote’s	25
knees	25
altogether	25
under	25
control,	25
for	25
he	25
too	25
shook	25
a	25
little,	25
squeezed	25
his	25
shoulders	25
together	25
and	25
lost	25
colour.	25
The	25
crew	25
then	25
hoisted	25
the	25
yard	25
with	25
the	25
same	25
rapidity	25
and	25
clatter	25
as	25
when	25
they	25
lowered	25
it,	25
all	25
the	25
while	25
keeping	25
silence	25
as	25
though	25
they	25
had	25
neither	25
voice	25
nor	25
breath.	25
The	25
boatswain	25
gave	25
the	25
signal	25
to	25
weigh	25
anchor,	25
and	25
leaping	25
upon	25
the	25
middle	25
of	25
the	25
gangway	25
began	25
to	25
lay	25
on	25
to	25
the	25
shoulders	25
of	25
the	25
crew	25
with	25
his	25
courbash	25
or	25
whip,	25
and	25
to	25
haul	25
out	25
gradually	25
to	25
sea.	25
When	25
Sancho	25
saw	25
so	25
many	25
red	25
feet	25
(for	25
such	25
he	25
took	25
the	25
oars	25
to	25
be)	25
moving	25
all	25
together,	25
he	25
said	25
to	25
himself,	25
“It’s	25
these	25
that	25
are	25
the	25
real	25
chanted	25
things,	25
and	25
not	25
the	25
ones	25
my	25
master	25
talks	25
of.	25
What	25
can	25
those	25
wretches	25
have	25
done	25
to	25
be	25
so	25
whipped;	25
and	25
how	25
does	25
that	25
one	25
man	25
who	25
goes	25
along	25
there	25
whistling	25
dare	25
to	25
whip	25
so	25
many?	25
I	25
declare	25
this	25
is	25
hell,	25
or	25
at	25
least	25
purgatory!”	25
Don	25
Quixote,	25
observing	25
how	25
attentively	25
Sancho	25
regarded	25
what	25
was	25
going	25
on,	25
said	25
to	25
him,	25
“Ah,	25
Sancho	25
my	25
friend,	25
how	25
quickly	25
and	25
cheaply	25
might	25
you	25
finish	25
off	25
the	25
disenchantment	25
of	25
Dulcinea,	25
if	25
you	25
would	25
strip	25
to	25
the	25
waist	25
and	25
take	25
your	25
place	25
among	25
those	25
gentlemen!	25
Amid	25
the	25
pain	25
and	25
sufferings	25
of	25
so	25
many	25
you	25
would	25
not	25
feel	25
your	25
own	25
much;	25
and	25
moreover	25
perhaps	25
the	25
sage	25
Merlin	25
would	25
allow	25
each	25
of	25
these	25
lashes,	25
being	25
laid	25
on	25
with	25
a	25
good	25
hand,	25
to	25
count	25
for	25
ten	25
of	25
those	25
which	25
you	25
must	25
give	25
yourself	25
at	25
last.”	25
The	25
general	25
was	25
about	25
to	25
ask	25
what	25
these	25
lashes	25
were,	25
and	25
what	25
was	25
Dulcinea’s	25
disenchantment,	25
when	25
a	25
sailor	25
exclaimed,	25
“Monjui	25
signals	25
that	25
there	25
is	25
an	25
oared	25
vessel	25
off	25
the	25
coast	25
to	25
the	25
west.”	25
On	25
hearing	25
this	25
the	25
general	25
sprang	25
upon	25
the	25
gangway	25
crying,	25
“Now	25
then,	25
my	25
sons,	25
don’t	25
let	25
her	25
give	25
us	25
the	25
slip!	25
It	25
must	25
be	25
some	25
Algerine	25
corsair	25
brigantine	25
that	25
the	25
watchtower	25
signals	25
to	25
us.”	25
The	25
three	25
others	25
immediately	25
came	25
alongside	25
the	25
chief	25
galley	25
to	25
receive	25
their	25
orders.	25
The	25
general	25
ordered	25
two	25
to	25
put	25
out	25
to	25
sea	25
while	25
he	25
with	25
the	25
other	25
kept	25
in	25
shore,	25
so	25
that	25
in	25
this	25
way	25
the	25
vessel	25
could	25
not	25
escape	25
them.	25
The	25
crews	25
plied	25
the	25
oars	25
driving	25
the	25
galleys	25
so	25
furiously	25
that	25
they	25
seemed	25
to	25
fly.	25
The	25
two	25
that	25
had	25
put	25
out	25
to	25
sea,	25
after	25
a	25
couple	25
of	25
miles	25
sighted	25
a	25
vessel	25
which,	25
so	25
far	25
as	25
they	25
could	25
make	25
out,	25
they	25
judged	25
to	25
be	25
one	25
of	25
fourteen	25
or	25
fifteen	25
banks,	25
and	25
so	25
she	25
proved.	25
As	25
soon	25
as	25
the	25
vessel	25
discovered	25
the	25
galleys	25
she	25
went	25
about	25
with	25
the	25
object	25
and	25
in	25
the	25
hope	25
of	25
making	25
her	25
escape	25
by	25
her	25
speed;	25
but	25
the	25
attempt	25
failed,	25
for	25
the	25
chief	25
galley	25
was	25
one	25
of	25
the	25
fastest	25
vessels	25
afloat,	25
and	25
overhauled	25
her	25
so	25
rapidly	25
that	25
they	25
on	25
board	25
the	25
brigantine	25
saw	25
clearly	25
there	25
was	25
no	25
possibility	25
of	25
escaping,	25
and	25
the	25
rais	25
therefore	25
would	25
have	25
had	25
them	25
drop	25
their	25
oars	25
and	25
give	25
themselves	25
up	25
so	25
as	25
not	25
to	25
provoke	25
the	25
captain	25
in	25
command	25
of	25
our	25
galleys	25
to	25
anger.	25
But	25
chance,	25
directing	25
things	25
otherwise,	25
so	25
ordered	25
it	25
that	25
just	25
as	25
the	25
chief	25
galley	25
came	25
close	25
enough	25
for	25
those	25
on	25
board	25
the	25
vessel	25
to	25
hear	25
the	25
shouts	25
from	25
her	25
calling	25
on	25
them	25
to	25
surrender,	25
two	25
Toraquis,	25
that	25
is	25
to	25
say	25
two	25
Turks,	25
both	25
drunken,	25
that	25
with	25
a	25
dozen	25
more	25
were	25
on	25
board	25
the	25
brigantine,	25
discharged	25
their	25
muskets,	25
killing	25
two	25
of	25
the	25
soldiers	25
that	25
lined	25
the	25
sides	25
of	25
our	25
vessel.	25
Seeing	25
this	25
the	25
general	25
swore	25
he	25
would	25
not	25
leave	25
one	25
of	25
those	25
he	25
found	25
on	25
board	25
the	25
vessel	25
alive,	25
but	25
as	25
he	25
bore	25
down	25
furiously	25
upon	25
her	25
she	25
slipped	25
away	25
from	25
him	25
underneath	25
the	25
oars.	25
The	25
galley	25
shot	25
a	25
good	25
way	25
ahead;	25
those	25
on	25
board	25
the	25
vessel	25
saw	25
their	25
case	25
was	25
desperate,	25
and	25
while	25
the	25
galley	25
was	25
coming	25
about	25
they	25
made	25
sail,	25
and	25
by	25
sailing	25
and	25
rowing	25
once	25
more	25
tried	25
to	25
sheer	25
off;	25
but	25
their	25
activity	25
did	25
not	25
do	25
them	25
as	25
much	25
good	25
as	25
their	25
rashness	25
did	25
them	25
harm,	25
for	25
the	25
galley	25
coming	25
up	25
with	25
them	25
in	25
a	25
little	25
more	25
than	25
half	25
a	25
mile	25
threw	25
her	25
oars	25
over	25
them	25
and	25
took	25
the	25
whole	25
of	25
them	25
alive.	25
The	25
other	25
two	25
galleys	25
now	25
joined	25
company	25
and	25
all	25
four	25
returned	25
with	25
the	25
prize	25
to	25
the	25
beach,	25
where	25
a	25
vast	25
multitude	25
stood	25
waiting	25
for	25
them,	25
eager	25
to	25
see	25
what	25
they	25
brought	25
back.	25
The	25
general	25
anchored	25
close	25
in,	25
and	25
perceived	25
that	25
the	25
viceroy	25
of	25
the	25
city	25
was	25
on	25
the	25
shore.	25
He	25
ordered	25
the	25
skiff	25
to	25
push	25
off	25
to	25
fetch	25
him,	25
and	25
the	25
yard	25
to	25
be	25
lowered	25
for	25
the	25
purpose	25
of	25
hanging	25
forthwith	25
the	25
rais	25
and	25
the	25
rest	25
of	25
the	25
men	25
taken	25
on	25
board	25
the	25
vessel,	25
about	25
six-and-thirty	25
in	25
number,	25
all	25
smart	25
fellows	25
and	25
most	25
of	25
them	25
Turkish	25
musketeers.	25
He	25
asked	25
which	25
was	25
the	25
rais	25
of	25
the	25
brigantine,	25
and	25
was	25
answered	25
in	25
Spanish	25
by	25
one	25
of	25
the	25
prisoners	25
(who	25
afterwards	25
proved	25
to	25
be	25
a	25
Spanish	25
renegade),	25
“This	25
young	25
man,	25
señor	25
that	25
you	25
see	25
here	25
is	25
our	25
rais,”	25
and	25
he	25
pointed	25
to	25
one	25
of	25
the	25
handsomest	25
and	25
most	25
gallant-looking	25
youths	25
that	25
could	25
be	25
imagined.	25
He	25
did	25
not	25
seem	25
to	25
be	25
twenty	25
years	25
of	25
age.	25
“Tell	25
me,	25
dog,”	25
said	25
the	25
general,	25
“what	25
led	25
thee	25
to	25
kill	25
my	25
soldiers,	25
when	25
thou	25
sawest	25
it	25
was	25
impossible	25
for	25
thee	25
to	25
escape?	25
Is	25
that	25
the	25
way	25
to	25
behave	25
to	25
chief	25
galleys?	25
Knowest	25
thou	25
not	25
that	25
rashness	25
is	25
not	25
valour?	25
Faint	25
prospects	25
of	25
success	25
should	25
make	25
men	25
bold,	25
but	25
not	25
rash.”	25
The	25
rais	25
was	25
about	25
to	25
reply,	25
but	25
the	25
general	25
could	25
not	25
at	25
that	25
moment	25
listen	25
to	25
him,	25
as	25
he	25
had	25
to	25
hasten	25
to	25
receive	25
the	25
viceroy,	25
who	25
was	25
now	25
coming	25
on	25
board	25
the	25
galley,	25
and	25
with	25
him	25
certain	25
of	25
his	25
attendants	25
and	25
some	25
of	25
the	25
people.	25
“You	25
have	25
had	25
a	25
good	25
chase,	25
señor	25
general,”	25
said	25
the	25
viceroy.	25
“Your	25
excellency	25
shall	25
soon	25
see	25
how	25
good,	25
by	25
the	25
game	25
strung	25
up	25
to	25
this	25
yard,”	25
replied	25
the	25
general.	25
“How	25
so?”	25
returned	25
the	25
viceroy.	25
“Because,”	25
said	25
the	25
general,	25
“against	25
all	25
law,	25
reason,	25
and	25
usages	25
of	25
war	25
they	25
have	25
killed	25
on	25
my	25
hands	25
two	25
of	25
the	25
best	25
soldiers	25
on	25
board	25
these	25
galleys,	25
and	25
I	25
have	25
sworn	25
to	25
hang	25
every	25
man	25
that	25
I	25
have	25
taken,	25
but	25
above	25
all	25
this	25
youth	25
who	25
is	25
the	25
rais	25
of	25
the	25
brigantine,”	25
and	25
he	25
pointed	25
to	25
him	25
as	25
he	25
stood	25
with	25
his	25
hands	25
already	25
bound	25
and	25
the	25
rope	25
round	25
his	25
neck,	25
ready	25
for	25
death.	25
The	25
viceroy	25
looked	25
at	25
him,	25
and	25
seeing	25
him	25
so	25
well-favoured,	25
so	25
graceful,	25
and	25
so	25
submissive,	25
he	25
felt	25
a	25
desire	25
to	25
spare	25
his	25
life,	25
the	25
comeliness	25
of	25
the	25
youth	25
furnishing	25
him	25
at	25
once	25
with	25
a	25
letter	25
of	25
recommendation.	25
He	25
therefore	25
questioned	25
him,	25
saying,	25
“Tell	25
me,	25
rais,	25
art	25
thou	25
Turk,	25
Moor,	25
or	25
renegade?”	25
To	25
which	25
the	25
youth	25
replied,	25
also	25
in	25
Spanish,	25
“I	25
am	25
neither	25
Turk,	25
nor	25
Moor,	25
nor	25
renegade.”	25
“What	25
art	25
thou,	25
then?”	25
said	25
the	25
viceroy.	25
“A	25
Christian	25
woman,”	25
replied	25
the	25
youth.	25
“A	25
woman	25
and	25
a	25
Christian,	25
in	25
such	25
a	25
dress	25
and	25
in	25
such	25
circumstances!	25
It	25
is	25
more	25
marvellous	25
than	25
credible,”	25
said	25
the	25
viceroy.	25
“Suspend	25
the	25
execution	25
of	25
the	25
sentence,”	25
said	25
the	25
youth;	25
“your	25
vengeance	25
will	25
not	25
lose	25
much	25
by	25
waiting	25
while	25
I	25
tell	25
you	25
the	25
story	25
of	25
my	25
life.”	25
What	25
heart	25
could	25
be	25
so	25
hard	25
as	25
not	25
to	25
be	25
softened	25
by	25
these	25
words,	25
at	25
any	25
rate	25
so	25
far	25
as	25
to	25
listen	25
to	25
what	25
the	25
unhappy	25
youth	25
had	25
to	25
say?	25
The	25
general	25
bade	25
him	25
say	25
what	25
he	25
pleased,	25
but	25
not	25
to	25
expect	25
pardon	25
for	25
his	25
flagrant	25
offence.	25
With	25
this	25
permission	25
the	25
youth	25
began	25
in	25
these	25
words.	25
“Born	25
of	25
Morisco	25
parents,	25
I	25
am	25
of	25
that	25
nation,	25
more	25
unhappy	25
than	25
wise,	25
upon	25
which	25
of	25
late	25
a	25
sea	25
of	25
woes	25
has	25
poured	25
down.	25
In	25
the	25
course	25
of	25
our	25
misfortune	25
I	25
was	25
carried	25
to	25
Barbary	25
by	25
two	25
uncles	25
of	25
mine,	25
for	25
it	25
was	25
in	25
vain	25
that	25
I	25
declared	25
I	25
was	25
a	25
Christian,	25
as	25
in	25
fact	25
I	25
am,	25
and	25
not	25
a	25
mere	25
pretended	25
one,	25
or	25
outwardly,	25
but	25
a	25
true	25
Catholic	25
Christian.	25
It	25
availed	25
me	25
nothing	25
with	25
those	25
charged	25
with	25
our	25
sad	25
expatriation	25
to	25
protest	25
this,	25
nor	25
would	25
my	25
uncles	25
believe	25
it;	25
on	25
the	25
contrary,	25
they	25
treated	25
it	25
as	25
an	25
untruth	25
and	25
a	25
subterfuge	25
set	25
up	25
to	25
enable	25
me	25
to	25
remain	25
behind	25
in	25
the	25
land	25
of	25
my	25
birth;	25
and	25
so,	25
more	25
by	25
force	25
than	25
of	25
my	25
own	25
will,	25
they	25
took	25
me	25
with	25
them.	25
I	25
had	25
a	25
Christian	25
mother,	25
and	25
a	25
father	25
who	25
was	25
a	25
man	25
of	25
sound	25
sense	25
and	25
a	25
Christian	25
too;	25
I	25
imbibed	25
the	25
Catholic	25
faith	25
with	25
my	25
mother’s	25
milk,	25
I	25
was	25
well	25
brought	25
up,	25
and	25
neither	25
in	25
word	25
nor	25
in	25
deed	25
did	25
I,	25
I	25
think,	25
show	25
any	25
sign	25
of	25
being	25
a	25
Morisco.	25
To	25
accompany	25
these	25
virtues,	25
for	25
such	25
I	25
hold	25
them,	25
my	25
beauty,	25
if	25
I	25
possess	25
any,	25
grew	25
with	25
my	25
growth;	25
and	25
great	25
as	25
was	25
the	25
seclusion	25
in	25
which	25
I	25
lived	25
it	25
was	25
not	25
so	25
great	25
but	25
that	25
a	25
young	25
gentleman,	25
Don	25
Gaspar	25
Gregorio	25
by	25
name,	25
eldest	25
son	25
of	25
a	25
gentleman	25
who	25
is	25
lord	25
of	25
a	25
village	25
near	25
ours,	25
contrived	25
to	25
find	25
opportunities	25
of	25
seeing	25
me.	25
How	25
he	25
saw	25
me,	25
how	25
we	25
met,	25
how	25
his	25
heart	25
was	25
lost	25
to	25
me,	25
and	25
mine	25
not	25
kept	25
from	25
him,	25
would	25
take	25
too	25
long	25
to	25
tell,	25
especially	25
at	25
a	25
moment	25
when	25
I	25
am	25
in	25
dread	25
of	25
the	25
cruel	25
cord	25
that	25
threatens	25
me	25
interposing	25
between	25
tongue	25
and	25
throat;	25
I	25
will	25
only	25
say,	25
therefore,	25
that	25
Don	25
Gregorio	25
chose	25
to	25
accompany	25
me	25
in	25
our	25
banishment.	25
He	25
joined	25
company	25
with	25
the	25
Moriscoes	25
who	25
were	25
going	25
forth	25
from	25
other	25
villages,	25
for	25
he	25
knew	25
their	25
language	25
very	25
well,	25
and	25
on	25
the	25
voyage	25
he	25
struck	25
up	25
a	25
friendship	25
with	25
my	25
two	25
uncles	25
who	25
were	25
carrying	25
me	25
with	25
them;	25
for	25
my	25
father,	25
like	25
a	25
wise	25
and	25
far-sighted	25
man,	25
as	25
soon	25
as	25
he	25
heard	25
the	25
first	25
edict	25
for	25
our	25
expulsion,	25
quitted	25
the	25
village	25
and	25
departed	25
in	25
quest	25
of	25
some	25
refuge	25
for	25
us	25
abroad.	25
He	25
left	25
hidden	25
and	25
buried,	25
at	25
a	25
spot	25
of	25
which	25
I	25
alone	25
have	25
knowledge,	25
a	25
large	25
quantity	25
of	25
pearls	25
and	25
precious	25
stones	25
of	25
great	25
value,	25
together	25
with	25
a	25
sum	25
of	25
money	25
in	25
gold	25
cruzadoes	25
and	25
doubloons.	25
He	25
charged	25
me	25
on	25
no	25
account	25
to	25
touch	25
the	25
treasure,	25
if	25
by	25
any	25
chance	25
they	25
expelled	25
us	25
before	25
his	25
return.	25
I	25
obeyed	25
him,	25
and	25
with	25
my	25
uncles,	25
as	25
I	25
have	25
said,	25
and	25
others	25
of	25
our	25
kindred	25
and	25
neighbours,	25
passed	25
over	25
to	25
Barbary,	25
and	25
the	25
place	25
where	25
we	25
took	25
up	25
our	25
abode	25
was	25
Algiers,	25
much	25
the	25
same	25
as	25
if	25
we	25
had	25
taken	25
it	25
up	25
in	25
hell	25
itself.	25
The	25
king	25
heard	25
of	25
my	25
beauty,	25
and	25
report	25
told	25
him	25
of	25
my	25
wealth,	25
which	25
was	25
in	25
some	25
degree	25
fortunate	25
for	25
me.	25
He	25
summoned	25
me	25
before	25
him,	25
and	25
asked	25
me	25
what	25
part	25
of	25
Spain	25
I	25
came	25
from,	25
and	25
what	25
money	25
and	25
jewels	25
I	25
had.	25
I	25
mentioned	25
the	25
place,	25
and	25
told	25
him	25
the	25
jewels	25
and	25
money	25
were	25
buried	25
there;	25
but	25
that	25
they	25
might	25
easily	25
be	25
recovered	25
if	25
I	25
myself	25
went	25
back	25
for	25
them.	25
All	25
this	25
I	25
told	25
him,	25
in	25
dread	25
lest	25
my	25
beauty	25
and	25
not	25
his	25
own	25
covetousness	25
should	25
influence	25
him.	25
While	25
he	25
was	25
engaged	25
in	25
conversation	25
with	25
me,	25
they	25
brought	25
him	25
word	25
that	25
in	25
company	25
with	25
me	25
was	25
one	25
of	25
the	25
handsomest	25
and	25
most	25
graceful	25
youths	25
that	25
could	25
be	25
imagined.	25
I	25
knew	25
at	25
once	25
that	25
they	25
were	25
speaking	25
of	25
Don	25
Gaspar	25
Gregorio,	25
whose	25
comeliness	25
surpasses	25
the	25
most	25
highly	25
vaunted	25
beauty.	25
I	25
was	25
troubled	25
when	25
I	25
thought	25
of	25
the	25
danger	25
he	25
was	25
in,	25
for	25
among	25
those	25
barbarous	25
Turks	25
a	25
fair	25
youth	25
is	25
more	25
esteemed	25
than	25
a	25
woman,	25
be	25
she	25
ever	25
so	25
beautiful.	25
The	25
king	25
immediately	25
ordered	25
him	25
to	25
be	25
brought	25
before	25
him	25
that	25
he	25
might	25
see	25
him,	25
and	25
asked	25
me	25
if	25
what	25
they	25
said	25
about	25
the	25
youth	25
was	25
true.	25
I	25
then,	25
almost	25
as	25
if	25
inspired	25
by	25
heaven,	25
told	25
him	25
it	25
was,	25
but	25
that	25
I	25
would	25
have	25
him	25
to	25
know	25
it	25
was	25
not	25
a	25
man,	25
but	25
a	25
woman	25
like	25
myself,	25
and	25
I	25
entreated	25
him	25
to	25
allow	25
me	25
to	25
go	25
and	25
dress	25
her	25
in	25
the	25
attire	25
proper	25
to	25
her,	25
so	25
that	25
her	25
beauty	25
might	25
be	25
seen	25
to	25
perfection,	25
and	25
that	25
she	25
might	25
present	25
herself	25
before	25
him	25
with	25
less	25
embarrassment.	25
He	25
bade	25
me	25
go	25
by	25
all	25
means,	25
and	25
said	25
that	25
the	25
next	25
day	25
we	25
should	25
discuss	25
the	25
plan	25
to	25
be	25
adopted	25
for	25
my	25
return	25
to	25
Spain	25
to	25
carry	25
away	25
the	25
hidden	25
treasure.	25
I	25
saw	25
Don	25
Gaspar,	25
I	25
told	25
him	25
the	25
danger	25
he	25
was	25
in	25
if	25
he	25
let	25
it	25
be	25
seen	25
he	25
was	25
a	25
man,	25
I	25
dressed	25
him	25
as	25
a	25
Moorish	25
woman,	25
and	25
that	25
same	25
afternoon	25
I	25
brought	25
him	25
before	25
the	25
king,	25
who	25
was	25
charmed	25
when	25
he	25
saw	25
him,	25
and	25
resolved	25
to	25
keep	25
the	25
damsel	25
and	25
make	25
a	25
present	25
of	25
her	25
to	25
the	25
Grand	25
Signor;	25
and	25
to	25
avoid	25
the	25
risk	25
she	25
might	25
run	25
among	25
the	25
women	25
of	25
his	25
seraglio,	25
and	25
distrustful	25
of	25
himself,	25
he	25
commanded	25
her	25
to	25
be	25
placed	25
in	25
the	25
house	25
of	25
some	25
Moorish	25
ladies	25
of	25
rank	25
who	25
would	25
protect	25
and	25
attend	25
to	25
her;	25
and	25
thither	25
he	25
was	25
taken	25
at	25
once.	25
What	25
we	25
both	25
suffered	25
(for	25
I	25
cannot	25
deny	25
that	25
I	25
love	25
him)	25
may	25
be	25
left	25
to	25
the	25
imagination	25
of	25
those	25
who	25
are	25
separated	25
if	25
they	25
love	25
one	25
another	25
dearly.	25
The	25
king	25
then	25
arranged	25
that	25
I	25
should	25
return	25
to	25
Spain	25
in	25
this	25
brigantine,	25
and	25
that	25
two	25
Turks,	25
those	25
who	25
killed	25
your	25
soldiers,	25
should	25
accompany	25
me.	25
There	25
also	25
came	25
with	25
me	25
this	25
Spanish	25
renegade”—and	25
here	25
she	25
pointed	25
to	25
him	25
who	25
had	25
first	25
spoken—“whom	25
I	25
know	25
to	25
be	25
secretly	25
a	25
Christian,	25
and	25
to	25
be	25
more	25
desirous	25
of	25
being	25
left	25
in	25
Spain	25
than	25
of	25
returning	25
to	25
Barbary.	25
The	25
rest	25
of	25
the	25
crew	25
of	25
the	25
brigantine	25
are	25
Moors	25
and	25
Turks,	25
who	25
merely	25
serve	25
as	25
rowers.	25
The	25
two	25
Turks,	25
greedy	25
and	25
insolent,	25
instead	25
of	25
obeying	25
the	25
orders	25
we	25
had	25
to	25
land	25
me	25
and	25
this	25
renegade	25
in	25
Christian	25
dress	25
(with	25
which	25
we	25
came	25
provided)	25
on	25
the	25
first	25
Spanish	25
ground	25
we	25
came	25
to,	25
chose	25
to	25
run	25
along	25
the	25
coast	25
and	25
make	25
some	25
prize	25
if	25
they	25
could,	25
fearing	25
that	25
if	25
they	25
put	25
us	25
ashore	25
first,	25
we	25
might,	25
in	25
case	25
of	25
some	25
accident	25
befalling	25
us,	25
make	25
it	25
known	25
that	25
the	25
brigantine	25
was	25
at	25
sea,	25
and	25
thus,	25
if	25
there	25
happened	25
to	25
be	25
any	25
galleys	25
on	25
the	25
coast,	25
they	25
might	25
be	25
taken.	25
We	25
sighted	25
this	25
shore	25
last	25
night,	25
and	25
knowing	25
nothing	25
of	25
these	25
galleys,	25
we	25
were	25
discovered,	25
and	25
the	25
result	25
was	25
what	25
you	25
have	25
seen.	25
To	25
sum	25
up,	25
there	25
is	25
Don	25
Gregorio	25
in	25
woman’s	25
dress,	25
among	25
women,	25
in	25
imminent	25
danger	25
of	25
his	25
life;	25
and	25
here	25
am	25
I,	25
with	25
hands	25
bound,	25
in	25
expectation,	25
or	25
rather	25
in	25
dread,	25
of	25
losing	25
my	25
life,	25
of	25
which	25
I	25
am	25
already	25
weary.	25
Here,	25
sirs,	25
ends	25
my	25
sad	25
story,	25
as	25
true	25
as	25
it	25
is	25
unhappy;	25
all	25
I	25
ask	25
of	25
you	25
is	25
to	25
allow	25
me	25
to	25
die	25
like	25
a	25
Christian,	25
for,	25
as	25
I	25
have	25
already	25
said,	25
I	25
am	25
not	25
to	25
be	25
charged	25
with	25
the	25
offence	25
of	25
which	25
those	25
of	25
my	25
nation	25
are	25
guilty;”	25
and	25
she	25
stood	25
silent,	25
her	25
eyes	25
filled	25
with	25
moving	25
tears,	25
accompanied	25
by	25
plenty	25
from	25
the	25
bystanders.	25
The	25
viceroy,	25
touched	25
with	25
compassion,	25
went	25
up	25
to	25
her	25
without	25
speaking	25
and	25
untied	25
the	25
cord	25
that	25
bound	25
the	25
hands	25
of	25
the	25
Moorish	25
girl.	25
But	25
all	25
the	25
while	25
the	25
Morisco	25
Christian	25
was	25
telling	25
her	25
strange	25
story,	25
an	25
elderly	25
pilgrim,	25
who	25
had	25
come	25
on	25
board	25
of	25
the	25
galley	25
at	25
the	25
same	25
time	25
as	25
the	25
viceroy,	25
kept	25
his	25
eyes	25
fixed	25
upon	25
her;	25
and	25
the	25
instant	25
she	25
ceased	25
speaking	25
he	25
threw	25
himself	25
at	25
her	25
feet,	25
and	25
embracing	25
them	25
said	25
in	25
a	25
voice	25
broken	25
by	25
sobs	25
and	25
sighs,	25
“O	25
Ana	25
Felix,	25
my	25
unhappy	25
daughter,	25
I	25
am	25
thy	25
father	25
Ricote,	25
come	25
back	25
to	25
look	25
for	25
thee,	25
unable	25
to	25
live	25
without	25
thee,	25
my	25
soul	25
that	25
thou	25
art!”	25
At	25
these	25
words	25
of	25
his,	25
Sancho	25
opened	25
his	25
eyes	25
and	25
raised	25
his	25
head,	25
which	25
he	25
had	25
been	25
holding	25
down,	25
brooding	25
over	25
his	25
unlucky	25
excursion;	25
and	25
looking	25
at	25
the	25
pilgrim	25
he	25
recognised	25
in	25
him	25
that	25
same	25
Ricote	25
he	25
met	25
the	25
day	25
he	25
quitted	25
his	25
government,	25
and	25
felt	25
satisfied	25
that	25
this	25
was	25
his	25
daughter.	25
She	25
being	25
now	25
unbound	25
embraced	25
her	25
father,	25
mingling	25
her	25
tears	25
with	25
his,	25
while	25
he	25
addressing	25
the	25
general	25
and	25
the	25
viceroy	25
said,	25
“This,	25
sirs,	25
is	25
my	25
daughter,	25
more	25
unhappy	25
in	25
her	25
adventures	25
than	25
in	25
her	25
name.	25
She	25
is	25
Ana	25
Felix,	25
surnamed	25
Ricote,	25
celebrated	25
as	25
much	25
for	25
her	25
own	25
beauty	25
as	25
for	25
my	25
wealth.	25
I	25
quitted	25
my	25
native	25
land	25
in	25
search	25
of	25
some	25
shelter	25
or	25
refuge	25
for	25
us	25
abroad,	25
and	25
having	25
found	25
one	25
in	25
Germany	25
I	25
returned	25
in	25
this	25
pilgrim’s	25
dress,	25
in	25
the	25
company	25
of	25
some	25
other	25
German	25
pilgrims,	25
to	25
seek	25
my	25
daughter	25
and	25
take	25
up	25
a	25
large	25
quantity	25
of	25
treasure	25
I	25
had	25
left	25
buried.	25
My	25
daughter	25
I	25
did	25
not	25
find,	25
the	25
treasure	25
I	25
found	25
and	25
have	25
with	25
me;	25
and	25
now,	25
in	25
this	25
strange	25
roundabout	25
way	25
you	25
have	25
seen,	25
I	25
find	25
the	25
treasure	25
that	25
more	25
than	25
all	25
makes	25
me	25
rich,	25
my	25
beloved	25
daughter.	25
If	25
our	25
innocence	25
and	25
her	25
tears	25
and	25
mine	25
can	25
with	25
strict	25
justice	25
open	25
the	25
door	25
to	25
clemency,	25
extend	25
it	25
to	25
us,	25
for	25
we	25
never	25
had	25
any	25
intention	25
of	25
injuring	25
you,	25
nor	25
do	25
we	25
sympathise	25
with	25
the	25
aims	25
of	25
our	25
people,	25
who	25
have	25
been	25
justly	25
banished.”	25
“I	25
know	25
Ricote	25
well,”	25
said	25
Sancho	25
at	25
this,	25
“and	25
I	25
know	25
too	25
that	25
what	25
he	25
says	25
about	25
Ana	25
Felix	25
being	25
his	25
daughter	25
is	25
true;	25
but	25
as	25
to	25
those	25
other	25
particulars	25
about	25
going	25
and	25
coming,	25
and	25
having	25
good	25
or	25
bad	25
intentions,	25
I	25
say	25
nothing.”	25
While	25
all	25
present	25
stood	25
amazed	25
at	25
this	25
strange	25
occurrence	25
the	25
general	25
said,	25
“At	25
any	25
rate	25
your	25
tears	25
will	25
not	25
allow	25
me	25
to	25
keep	25
my	25
oath;	25
live,	25
fair	25
Ana	25
Felix,	25
all	25
the	25
years	25
that	25
heaven	25
has	25
allotted	25
you;	25
but	25
these	25
rash	25
insolent	25
fellows	25
must	25
pay	25
the	25
penalty	25
of	25
the	25
crime	25
they	25
have	25
committed;”	25
and	25
with	25
that	25
he	25
gave	25
orders	25
to	25
have	25
the	25
two	25
Turks	25
who	25
had	25
killed	25
his	25
two	25
soldiers	25
hanged	25
at	25
once	25
at	25
the	25
yard-arm.	25
The	25
viceroy,	25
however,	25
begged	25
him	25
earnestly	25
not	25
to	25
hang	25
them,	25
as	25
their	25
behaviour	25
savoured	25
rather	25
of	25
madness	25
than	25
of	25
bravado.	25
The	25
general	25
yielded	25
to	25
the	25
viceroy’s	25
request,	25
for	25
revenge	25
is	25
not	25
easily	25
taken	25
in	25
cold	25
blood.	25
They	25
then	25
tried	25
to	25
devise	25
some	25
scheme	25
for	25
rescuing	25
Don	25
Gaspar	25
Gregorio	25
from	25
the	25
danger	25
in	25
which	25
he	25
had	25
been	25
left.	25
Ricote	25
offered	25
for	25
that	25
object	25
more	25
than	25
two	25
thousand	25
ducats	25
that	25
he	25
had	25
in	25
pearls	25
and	25
gems;	25
they	25
proposed	25
several	25
plans,	25
but	25
none	25
so	25
good	25
as	25
that	25
suggested	25
by	25
the	25
renegade	25
already	25
mentioned,	25
who	25
offered	25
to	25
return	25
to	25
Algiers	25
in	25
a	25
small	25
vessel	25
of	25
about	25
six	25
banks,	25
manned	25
by	25
Christian	25
rowers,	25
as	25
he	25
knew	25
where,	25
how,	25
and	25
when	25
he	25
could	25
and	25
should	25
land,	25
nor	25
was	25
he	25
ignorant	25
of	25
the	25
house	25
in	25
which	25
Don	25
Gaspar	25
was	25
staying.	25
The	25
general	25
and	25
the	25
viceroy	25
had	25
some	25
hesitation	25
about	25
placing	25
confidence	25
in	25
the	25
renegade	25
and	25
entrusting	25
him	25
with	25
the	25
Christians	25
who	25
were	25
to	25
row,	25
but	25
Ana	25
Felix	25
said	25
she	25
could	25
answer	25
for	25
him,	25
and	25
her	25
father	25
offered	25
to	25
go	25
and	25
pay	25
the	25
ransom	25
of	25
the	25
Christians	25
if	25
by	25
any	25
chance	25
they	25
should	25
not	25
be	25
forthcoming.	25
This,	25
then,	25
being	25
agreed	25
upon,	25
the	25
viceroy	25
landed,	25
and	25
Don	25
Antonio	25
Moreno	25
took	25
the	25
fair	25
Morisco	25
and	25
her	25
father	25
home	25
with	25
him,	25
the	25
viceroy	25
charging	25

give	25
them	25
the	25
best	25
reception	25
and	25
welcome	25
in	25
his	25
power,	25
while	25
on	25
his	25
own	25
part	25
he	25
offered	25
all	25
that	25
house	25
contained	25
for	25
their	25
entertainment;	25
so	25
great	25
was	25
the	25
good-will	25
and	25
kindliness	25
the	25
beauty	25
of	25
Ana	25
Felix	25
had	25
infused	25
into	25
his	25
heart.	25

The	25
wife	25
of	25
Don	25
Antonio	25
Moreno,	25
so	25
the	25
history	25
says,	25
was	25
extremely	25
happy	25
to	25
see	25
Ana	25
Felix	25
in	25
her	25
house.	25
She	25
welcomed	25
her	25
with	25
great	25
kindness,	25
charmed	25
as	25
well	25
by	25
her	25
beauty	25
as	25
by	25
her	25
intelligence;	25
for	25
in	25
both	25
respects	25
the	25
fair	25
Morisco	25
was	25
richly	25
endowed,	25
and	25
all	25
the	25
people	25
of	25
the	25
city	25
flocked	25
to	25
see	25
her	25
as	25
though	25
they	25
had	25
been	25
summoned	25
by	25
the	25
ringing	25
of	25
the	25
bells.	25
Don	25
Quixote	25
told	25
Don	25
Antonio	25
that	25
the	25
plan	25
adopted	25
for	25
releasing	25
Don	25
Gregorio	25
was	25
not	25
a	25
good	25
one,	25
for	25
its	25
risks	25
were	25
greater	25
than	25
its	25
advantages,	25
and	25
that	25
it	25
would	25
be	25
better	25
to	25
land	25
himself	25
with	25
his	25
arms	25
and	25
horse	25
in	25
Barbary;	25
for	25
he	25
would	25
carry	25
him	25
off	25
in	25
spite	25
of	25
the	25
whole	25
Moorish	25
host,	25
as	25
Don	25
Gaiferos	25
carried	25
off	25
his	25
wife	25
Melisendra.	25
“Remember,	25
your	25
worship,”	25
observed	25
Sancho	25
on	25
hearing	25
him	25
say	25
so,	25
“Señor	25
Don	25
Gaiferos	25
carried	25
off	25
his	25
wife	25
from	25
the	25
mainland,	25
and	25
took	25
her	25
to	25
France	25
by	25
land;	25
but	25
in	25
this	25
case,	25
if	25
by	25
chance	25
we	25
carry	25
off	25
Don	25
Gregorio,	25
we	25
have	25
no	25
way	25
of	25
bringing	25
him	25
to	25
Spain,	25
for	25
there’s	25
the	25
sea	25
between.”	25
“There’s	25
a	25
remedy	25
for	25
everything	25
except	25
death,”	25
said	25
Don	25
Quixote;	25
“if	25
they	25
bring	25
the	25
vessel	25
close	25
to	25
the	25
shore	25
we	25
shall	25
be	25
able	25
to	25
get	25
on	25
board	25
though	25
all	25
the	25
world	25
strive	25
to	25
prevent	25
us.”	25
“Your	25
worship	25
hits	25
it	25
off	25
mighty	25
well	25
and	25
mighty	25
easy,”	25
said	25
Sancho;	25
“but	25
‘it’s	25
a	25
long	25
step	25
from	25
saying	25
to	25
doing;’	25
and	25
I	25
hold	25
to	25
the	25
renegade,	25
for	25
he	25
seems	25
to	25
me	25
an	25
honest	25
good-hearted	25
fellow.”	25
Don	25
Antonio	25
then	25
said	25
that	25
if	25
the	25
renegade	25
did	25
not	25
prove	25
successful,	25
the	25
expedient	25
of	25
the	25
great	25
Don	25
Quixote’s	25
expedition	25
to	25
Barbary	25
should	25
be	25
adopted.	25
Two	25
days	25
afterwards	25
the	25
renegade	25
put	25
to	25
sea	25
in	25
a	25
light	25
vessel	25
of	25
six	25
oars	25
a-side	25
manned	25
by	25
a	25
stout	25
crew,	25
and	25
two	25
days	25
later	25
the	25
galleys	25
made	25
sail	25
eastward,	25
the	25
general	25
having	25
begged	25
the	25
viceroy	25
to	25
let	25
him	25
know	25
all	25
about	25
the	25
release	25
of	25
Don	25
Gregorio	25
and	25
about	25
Ana	25
Felix,	25
and	25
the	25
viceroy	25
promised	25
to	25
do	25
as	25
he	25
requested.	25
One	25
morning	25
as	25
Don	25
Quixote	25
went	25
out	25
for	25
a	25
stroll	25
along	25
the	25
beach,	25
arrayed	25
in	25
full	25
armour	25
(for,	25
as	25
he	25
often	25
said,	25
that	25
was	25
“his	25
only	25
gear,	25
his	25
only	25
rest	25
the	25
fray,”	25
and	25
he	25
never	25
was	25
without	25
it	25
for	25
a	25
moment),	25
he	25
saw	25
coming	25
towards	25
him	25
a	25
knight,	25
also	25
in	25
full	25
armour,	25
with	25
a	25
shining	25
moon	25
painted	25
on	25
his	25
shield,	25
who,	25
on	25
approaching	25
sufficiently	25
near	25
to	25
be	25
heard,	25
said	25
in	25
a	25
loud	25
voice,	25
addressing	25
himself	25
to	25
Don	25
Quixote,	25
“Illustrious	25
knight,	25
and	25
never	25
sufficiently	25
extolled	25
Don	25
Quixote	25
of	25
La	25
Mancha,	25
I	25
am	25
the	25
Knight	25
of	25
the	25
White	25
Moon,	25
whose	25
unheard-of	25
achievements	25
will	25
perhaps	25
have	25
recalled	25
him	25
to	25
thy	25
memory.	25
I	25
come	25
to	25
do	25
battle	25
with	25
thee	25
and	25
prove	25
the	25
might	25
of	25
thy	25
arm,	25
to	25
the	25
end	25
that	25
I	25
make	25
thee	25
acknowledge	25
and	25
confess	25
that	25
my	25
lady,	25
let	25
her	25
be	25
who	25
she	25
may,	25
is	25
incomparably	25
fairer	25
than	25
thy	25
Dulcinea	25
del	25
Toboso.	25
If	25
thou	25
dost	25
acknowledge	25
this	25
fairly	25
and	25
openly,	25
thou	25
shalt	25
escape	25
death	25
and	25
save	25
me	25
the	25
trouble	25
of	25
inflicting	25
it	25
upon	25
thee;	25
if	25
thou	25
fightest	25
and	25
I	25
vanquish	25
thee,	25
I	25
demand	25
no	25
other	25
satisfaction	25
than	25
that,	25
laying	25
aside	25
arms	25
and	25
abstaining	25
from	25
going	25
in	25
quest	25
of	25
adventures,	25
thou	25
withdraw	25
and	25
betake	25
thyself	25
to	25
thine	25
own	25
village	25
for	25
the	25
space	25
of	25
a	25
year,	25
and	25
live	25
there	25
without	25
putting	25
hand	25
to	25
sword,	25
in	25
peace	25
and	25
quiet	25
and	25
beneficial	25
repose,	25
the	25
same	25
being	25
needful	25
for	25
the	25
increase	25
of	25
thy	25
substance	25
and	25
the	25
salvation	25
of	25
thy	25
soul;	25
and	25
if	25
thou	25
dost	25
vanquish	25
me,	25
my	25
head	25
shall	25
be	25
at	25
thy	25
disposal,	25
my	25
arms	25
and	25
horse	25
thy	25
spoils,	25
and	25
the	25
renown	25
of	25
my	25
deeds	25
transferred	25
and	25
added	25
to	25
thine.	25
Consider	25
which	25
will	25
be	25
thy	25
best	25
course,	25
and	25
give	25
me	25
thy	25
answer	25
speedily,	25
for	25
this	25
day	25
is	25
all	25
the	25
time	25
I	25
have	25
for	25
the	25
despatch	25
of	25
this	25
business.”	25
Don	25
Quixote	25
was	25
amazed	25
and	25
astonished,	25
as	25
well	25
at	25
the	25
Knight	25
of	25
the	25
White	25
Moon’s	25
arrogance,	25
as	25
at	25
his	25
reason	25
for	25
delivering	25
the	25
defiance,	25
and	25
with	25
calm	25
dignity	25
he	25
answered	25
him,	25
“Knight	25
of	25
the	25
White	25
Moon,	25
of	25
whose	25
achievements	25
I	25
have	25
never	25
heard	25
until	25
now,	25
I	25
will	25
venture	25
to	25
swear	25
you	25
have	25
never	25
seen	25
the	25
illustrious	25
Dulcinea;	25
for	25
had	25
you	25
seen	25
her	25
I	25
know	25
you	25
would	25
have	25
taken	25
care	25
not	25
to	25
venture	25
yourself	25
upon	25
this	25
issue,	25
because	25
the	25
sight	25
would	25
have	25
removed	25
all	25
doubt	25
from	25
your	25
mind	25
that	25
there	25
ever	25
has	25
been	25
or	25
can	25
be	25
a	25
beauty	25
to	25
be	25
compared	25
with	25
hers;	25
and	25
so,	25
not	25
saying	25
you	25
lie,	25
but	25
merely	25
that	25
you	25
are	25
not	25
correct	25
in	25
what	25
you	25
state,	25
I	25
accept	25
your	25
challenge,	25
with	25
the	25
conditions	25
you	25
have	25
proposed,	25
and	25
at	25
once,	25
that	25
the	25
day	25
you	25
have	25
fixed	25
may	25
not	25
expire;	25
and	25
from	25
your	25
conditions	25
I	25
except	25
only	25
that	25
of	25
the	25
renown	25
of	25
your	25
achievements	25
being	25
transferred	25
to	25
me,	25
for	25
I	25
know	25
not	25
of	25
what	25
sort	25
they	25
are	25
nor	25
what	25
they	25
may	25
amount	25
to;	25
I	25
am	25
satisfied	25
with	25
my	25
own,	25
such	25
as	25
they	25
be.	25
Take,	25
therefore,	25
the	25
side	25
of	25
the	25
field	25
you	25
choose,	25
and	25
I	25
will	25
do	25
the	25
same;	25
and	25
to	25
whom	25
God	25
shall	25
give	25
it	25
may	25
Saint	25
Peter	25
add	25
his	25
blessing.”	25
The	25
Knight	25
of	25
the	25
White	25
Moon	25
had	25
been	25
seen	25
from	25
the	25
city,	25
and	25
it	25
was	25
told	25
the	25
viceroy	25
how	25
he	25
was	25
in	25
conversation	25
with	25
Don	25
Quixote.	25
The	25
viceroy,	25
fancying	25
it	25
must	25
be	25
some	25
fresh	25
adventure	25
got	25
up	25
by	25
Don	25
Antonio	25
Moreno	25
or	25
some	25
other	25
gentleman	25
of	25
the	25
city,	25
hurried	25
out	25
at	25
once	25
to	25
the	25
beach	25
accompanied	25
by	25
Don	25
Antonio	25
and	25
several	25
other	25
gentlemen,	25
just	25
as	25
Don	25
Quixote	25
was	25
wheeling	25
Rocinante	25
round	25
in	25
order	25
to	25
take	25
up	25
the	25
necessary	25
distance.	25
The	25
viceroy	25
upon	25
this,	25
seeing	25
that	25
the	25
pair	25
of	25
them	25
were	25
evidently	25
preparing	25
to	25
come	25
to	25
the	25
charge,	25
put	25
himself	25
between	25
them,	25
asking	25
them	25
what	25
it	25
was	25
that	25
led	25
them	25
to	25
engage	25
in	25
combat	25
all	25
of	25
a	25
sudden	25
in	25
this	25
way.	25
The	25
Knight	25
of	25
the	25
White	25
Moon	25
replied	25
that	25
it	25
was	25
a	25
question	25
of	25
precedence	25
of	25
beauty;	25
and	25
briefly	25
told	25
him	25
what	25
he	25
had	25
said	25
to	25
Don	25
Quixote,	25
and	25
how	25
the	25
conditions	25
of	25
the	25
defiance	25
agreed	25
upon	25
on	25
both	25
sides	25
had	25
been	25
accepted.	25
The	25
viceroy	25
went	25
over	25
to	25
Don	25
Antonio,	25
and	25
asked	25
in	25
a	25
low	25
voice	25
did	25
he	25
know	25
who	25
the	25
Knight	25
of	25
the	25
White	25
Moon	25
was,	25
or	25
was	25
it	25
some	25
joke	25
they	25
were	25
playing	25
on	25
Don	25
Quixote.	25
Don	25
Antonio	25
replied	25
that	25
he	25
neither	25
knew	25
who	25
he	25
was	25
nor	25
whether	25
the	25
defiance	25
was	25
in	25
joke	25
or	25
in	25
earnest.	25
This	25
answer	25
left	25
the	25
viceroy	25
in	25
a	25
state	25
of	25
perplexity,	25
not	25
knowing	25
whether	25
he	25
ought	25
to	25
let	25
the	25
combat	25
go	25
on	25
or	25
not;	25
but	25
unable	25
to	25
persuade	25
himself	25
that	25
it	25
was	25
anything	25
but	25
a	25
joke	25
he	25
fell	25
back,	25
saying,	25
“If	25
there	25
be	25
no	25
other	25
way	25
out	25
of	25
it,	25
gallant	25
knights,	25
except	25
to	25
confess	25
or	25
die,	25
and	25
Don	25
Quixote	25
is	25
inflexible,	25
and	25
your	25
worship	25
of	25
the	25
White	25
Moon	25
still	25
more	25
so,	25
in	25
God’s	25
hand	25
be	25
it,	25
and	25
fall	25
on.”	25
He	25
of	25
the	25
White	25
Moon	25
thanked	25
the	25
viceroy	25
in	25
courteous	25
and	25
well-chosen	25
words	25
for	25
the	25
permission	25
he	25
gave	25
them,	25
and	25
so	25
did	25
Don	25
Quixote,	25
who	25
then,	25
commending	25
himself	25
with	25
all	25
his	25
heart	25
to	25
heaven	25
and	25
to	25
his	25
Dulcinea,	25
as	25
was	25
his	25
custom	25
on	25
the	25
eve	25
of	25
any	25
combat	25
that	25
awaited	25
him,	25
proceeded	25
to	25
take	25
a	25
little	25
more	25
distance,	25
as	25
he	25
saw	25
his	25
antagonist	25
was	25
doing	25
the	25
same;	25
then,	25
without	25
blast	25
of	25
trumpet	25
or	25
other	25
warlike	25
instrument	25
to	25
give	25
them	25
the	25
signal	25
to	25
charge,	25
both	25
at	25
the	25
same	25
instant	25
wheeled	25
their	25
horses;	25
and	25
he	25
of	25
the	25
White	25
Moon,	25
being	25
the	25
swifter,	25
met	25
Don	25
Quixote	25
after	25
having	25
traversed	25
two-thirds	25
of	25
the	25
course,	25
and	25
there	25
encountered	25
him	25
with	25
such	25
violence	25
that,	25
without	25
touching	25
him	25
with	25
his	25
lance	25
(for	25
he	25
held	25
it	25
high,	25
to	25
all	25
appearance	25
purposely),	25
he	25
hurled	25
Don	25
Quixote	25
and	25
Rocinante	25
to	25
the	25
earth,	25
a	25
perilous	25
fall.	25
He	25
sprang	25
upon	25
him	25
at	25
once,	25
and	25
placing	25
the	25
lance	25
over	25
his	25
visor	25
said	25
to	25
him,	25
“You	25
are	25
vanquished,	25
sir	25
knight,	25
nay	25
dead	25
unless	25
you	25
admit	25
the	25
conditions	25
of	25
our	25
defiance.”	25
Don	25
Quixote,	25
bruised	25
and	25
stupefied,	25
without	25
raising	25
his	25
visor	25
said	25
in	25
a	25
weak	25
feeble	25
voice	25
as	25
if	25
he	25
were	25
speaking	25
out	25
of	25
a	25
tomb,	25
“Dulcinea	25
del	25
Toboso	25
is	25
the	25
fairest	25
woman	25
in	25
the	25
world,	25
and	25
I	25
the	25
most	25
unfortunate	25
knight	25
on	25
earth;	25
it	25
is	25
not	25
fitting	25
that	25
this	25
truth	25
should	25
suffer	25
by	25
my	25
feebleness;	25
drive	25
your	25
lance	25
home,	25
sir	25
knight,	25
and	25
take	25
my	25
life,	25
since	25
you	25
have	25
taken	25
away	25
my	25
honour.”	25
“That	25
will	25
I	25
not,	25
in	25
sooth,”	25
said	25
he	25
of	25
the	25
White	25
Moon;	25
“live	25
the	25
fame	25
of	25
the	25
lady	25
Dulcinea’s	25
beauty	25
undimmed	25
as	25
ever;	25
all	25
I	25
require	25
is	25
that	25
the	25
great	25
Don	25
Quixote	25
retire	25
to	25
his	25
own	25
home	25
for	25
a	25
year,	25
or	25
for	25
so	25
long	25
a	25
time	25
as	25
shall	25
by	25
me	25
be	25
enjoined	25
upon	25
him,	25
as	25
we	25
agreed	25
before	25
engaging	25
in	25
this	25
combat.”	25
The	25
viceroy,	25
Don	25
Antonio,	25
and	25
several	25
others	25
who	25
were	25
present	25
heard	25
all	25
this,	25
and	25
heard	25
too	25
how	25
Don	25
Quixote	25
replied	25
that	25
so	25
long	25
as	25
nothing	25
in	25
prejudice	25
of	25
Dulcinea	25
was	25
demanded	25
of	25
him,	25
he	25
would	25
observe	25
all	25
the	25
rest	25
like	25
a	25
true	25
and	25
loyal	25
knight.	25
The	25
engagement	25
given,	25
he	25
of	25
the	25
White	25
Moon	25
wheeled	25
about,	25
and	25
making	25
obeisance	25
to	25
the	25
viceroy	25
with	25
a	25
movement	25
of	25
the	25
head,	25
rode	25
away	25
into	25
the	25
city	25
at	25
a	25
half	25
gallop.	25
The	25
viceroy	25
bade	25
Don	25
Antonio	25
hasten	25
after	25
him,	25
and	25
by	25
some	25
means	25
or	25
other	25
find	25
out	25
who	25
he	25
was.	25
They	25
raised	25
Don	25
Quixote	25
up	25
and	25
uncovered	25
his	25
face,	25
and	25
found	25
him	25
pale	25
and	25
bathed	25
with	25
sweat.	25

Rocinante	25
from	25
the	25
mere	25
hard	25
measure	25
he	25
had	25
received	25
lay	25
unable	25
to	25
stir	25
for	25
the	25
present.	25
Sancho,	25
wholly	25
dejected	25
and	25
woebegone,	25
knew	25
not	25
what	25
to	25
say	25
or	25
do.	25
He	25
fancied	25
that	25
all	25
was	25
a	25
dream,	25
that	25
the	25
whole	25
business	25
was	25
a	25
piece	25
of	25
enchantment.	25
Here	25
was	25
his	25
master	25
defeated,	25
and	25
bound	25
not	25
to	25
take	25
up	25
arms	25
for	25
a	25
year.	25
He	25
saw	25
the	25
light	25
of	25
the	25
glory	25
of	25
his	25
achievements	25
obscured;	25
the	25
hopes	25
of	25
the	25
promises	25
lately	25
made	25
him	25
swept	25
away	25
like	25
smoke	25
before	25
the	25
wind;	25
Rocinante,	25
he	25
feared,	25
was	25
crippled	25
for	25
life,	25
and	25
his	25
master’s	25
bones	25
out	25
of	25
joint;	25
for	25
if	25
he	25
were	25
only	25
shaken	25
out	25
of	25
his	25
madness	25
it	25
would	25
be	25
no	25
small	25
luck.	25
In	25
the	25
end	25
they	25
carried	25
him	25
into	25
the	25
city	25
in	25
a	25
hand-chair	25
which	25
the	25
viceroy	25
sent	25
for,	25
and	25
thither	25
the	25
viceroy	25
himself	25
returned,	25
eager	25
to	25
ascertain	25
who	25
this	25
Knight	25
of	25
the	25
White	25
Moon	25
was	25
who	25
had	25
left	25
Don	25
Quixote	25

such	25
a	25
sad	25

followed	25
the	25
Knight	25
of	25
the	25

and	25
a	25
number	25
of	25
boys	25
followed	25
him	25
too,	25
nay	25
pursued	25
him,	25
until	25
they	25
had	25
him	25
fairly	25
housed	25
in	25
a	25
hostel	25
in	25
the	25
heart	25
of	25
the	25
city.	25
Don	25
Antonio,	25
eager	25
to	25
make	25
his	25
acquaintance,	25
entered	25
also;	25
a	25
squire	25
came	25
out	25
to	25
meet	25
him	25
and	25
remove	25
his	25
armour,	25
and	25
he	25
shut	25
himself	25
into	25
a	25
lower	25
room,	25
still	25
attended	25
by	25
Don	25
Antonio,	25
whose	25
bread	25
would	25
not	25
bake	25
until	25
he	25
had	25
found	25
out	25
who	25
he	25
was.	25
He	25
of	25
the	25
White	25
Moon,	25
seeing	25
then	25
that	25
the	25
gentleman	25
would	25
not	25
leave	25
him,	25
said,	25
“I	25
know	25
very	25
well,	25
señor,	25
what	25
you	25
have	25
come	25
for;	25
it	25
is	25
to	25
find	25
out	25
who	25
I	25
am;	25
and	25
as	25
there	25
is	25
no	25
reason	25
why	25
I	25
should	25
conceal	25
it	25
from	25
you,	25
while	25
my	25
servant	25
here	25
is	25
taking	25
off	25
my	25
armour	25
I	25
will	25
tell	25
you	25
the	25
true	25
state	25
of	25
the	25
case,	25
without	25
leaving	25
out	25
anything.	25
You	25
must	25
know,	25
señor,	25
that	25
I	25
am	25
called	25
the	25
bachelor	25
Samson	25
Carrasco.	25
I	25
am	25
of	25
the	25
same	25
village	25
as	25
Don	25
Quixote	25
of	25
La	25
Mancha,	25
whose	25
craze	25
and	25
folly	25
make	25
all	25
of	25
us	25
who	25
know	25
him	25
feel	25
pity	25
for	25
him,	25
and	25
I	25
am	25
one	25
of	25
those	25
who	25
have	25
felt	25
it	25
most;	25
and	25
persuaded	25
that	25
his	25
chance	25
of	25
recovery	25
lay	25
in	25
quiet	25
and	25
keeping	25
at	25
home	25
and	25
in	25
his	25
own	25
house,	25
I	25
hit	25
upon	25
a	25
device	25
for	25
keeping	25
him	25
there.	25
Three	25
months	25
ago,	25
therefore,	25
I	25
went	25
out	25
to	25
meet	25
him	25
as	25
a	25
knight-errant,	25
under	25
the	25
assumed	25
name	25
of	25
the	25
Knight	25
of	25
the	25
Mirrors,	25
intending	25
to	25
engage	25
him	25
in	25
combat	25
and	25
overcome	25
him	25
without	25
hurting	25
him,	25
making	25
it	25
the	25
condition	25
of	25
our	25
combat	25
that	25
the	25
vanquished	25
should	25
be	25
at	25
the	25
disposal	25
of	25
the	25
victor.	25
What	25
I	25
meant	25
to	25
demand	25
of	25
him	25
(for	25
I	25
regarded	25
him	25
as	25
vanquished	25
already)	25
was	25
that	25
he	25
should	25
return	25
to	25
his	25
own	25
village,	25
and	25
not	25
leave	25
it	25
for	25
a	25
whole	25
year,	25
by	25
which	25
time	25
he	25
might	25
be	25
cured.	25
But	25
fate	25
ordered	25
it	25
otherwise,	25
for	25
he	25
vanquished	25
me	25
and	25
unhorsed	25
me,	25
and	25
so	25
my	25
plan	25
failed.	25
He	25
went	25
his	25
way,	25
and	25
I	25
came	25
back	25
conquered,	25
covered	25
with	25
shame,	25
and	25
sorely	25
bruised	25
by	25
my	25
fall,	25
which	25
was	25
a	25
particularly	25
dangerous	25
one.	25
But	25
this	25
did	25
not	25
quench	25
my	25
desire	25
to	25
meet	25
him	25
again	25
and	25
overcome	25
him,	25
as	25
you	25
have	25
seen	25
to-day.	25
And	25
as	25
he	25
is	25
so	25
scrupulous	25
in	25
his	25
observance	25
of	25
the	25
laws	25
of	25
knight-errantry,	25
he	25
will,	25
no	25
doubt,	25
in	25
order	25
to	25
keep	25
his	25
word,	25
obey	25
the	25
injunction	25
I	25
have	25
laid	25
upon	25
him.	25
This,	25
señor,	25
is	25
how	25
the	25
matter	25
stands,	25
and	25
I	25
have	25
nothing	25
more	25
to	25
tell	25
you.	25
I	25
implore	25
of	25
you	25
not	25
to	25
betray	25
me,	25
or	25
tell	25
Don	25
Quixote	25
who	25
I	25
am;	25
so	25
that	25
my	25
honest	25
endeavours	25
may	25
be	25
successful,	25
and	25
that	25
a	25
man	25
of	25
excellent	25
wits—were	25
he	25
only	25
rid	25
of	25
the	25
fooleries	25
of	25
chivalry—may	25
get	25
them	25
back	25
again.”	25
“O	25
señor,”	25
said	25
Don	25
Antonio,	25
“may	25
God	25
forgive	25
you	25
the	25
wrong	25
you	25
have	25
done	25
the	25
whole	25
world	25
in	25
trying	25
to	25
bring	25
the	25
most	25
amusing	25
madman	25
in	25
it	25
back	25
to	25
his	25
senses.	25
Do	25
you	25
not	25
see,	25
señor,	25
that	25
the	25
gain	25
by	25
Don	25
Quixote’s	25
sanity	25
can	25
never	25
equal	25
the	25
enjoyment	25
his	25
crazes	25
give?	25
But	25
my	25
belief	25
is	25
that	25
all	25
the	25
señor	25
bachelor’s	25
pains	25
will	25
be	25
of	25
no	25
avail	25
to	25
bring	25
a	25
man	25
so	25
hopelessly	25
cracked	25
to	25
his	25
senses	25
again;	25
and	25
if	25
it	25
were	25
not	25
uncharitable,	25
I	25
would	25
say	25
may	25
Don	25
Quixote	25
never	25
be	25
cured,	25
for	25
by	25
his	25
recovery	25
we	25
lose	25
not	25
only	25
his	25
own	25
drolleries,	25
but	25
his	25
squire	25
Sancho	25
Panza’s	25
too,	25
any	25
one	25
of	25
which	25
is	25
enough	25
to	25
turn	25
melancholy	25
itself	25
into	25
merriment.	25
However,	25
I’ll	25
hold	25
my	25
peace	25
and	25
say	25
nothing	25
to	25
him,	25
and	25
we’ll	25
see	25
whether	25
I	25
am	25
right	25
in	25
my	25
suspicion	25
that	25
Señor	25
Carrasco’s	25
efforts	25
will	25
be	25
fruitless.”	25
The	25
bachelor	25
replied	25
that	25
at	25
all	25
events	25
the	25
affair	25
promised	25
well,	25
and	25
he	25
hoped	25
for	25
a	25
happy	25
result	25
from	25
it;	25
and	25
putting	25
his	25
services	25
at	25
Don	25
Antonio’s	25
commands	25
he	25
took	25
his	25
leave	25
of	25
him;	25
and	25
having	25
had	25
his	25
armour	25
packed	25
at	25
once	25
upon	25
a	25
mule,	25
he	25
rode	25
away	25
from	25
the	25
city	25
the	25
same	25
day	25
on	25
the	25
horse	25
he	25
rode	25
to	25
battle,	25
and	25
returned	25
to	25
his	25
own	25
country	25
without	25
meeting	25
any	25
adventure	25
calling	25
for	25
record	25
in	25
this	25
veracious	25
history.	25
Don	25
Antonio	25
reported	25
to	25
the	25
viceroy	25
what	25
Carrasco	25
told	25
him,	25
and	25
the	25
viceroy	25
was	25
not	25
very	25
well	25
pleased	25
to	25
hear	25
it,	25
for	25
with	25
Don	25
Quixote’s	25
retirement	25
there	25
was	25
an	25
end	25
to	25
the	25
amusement	25
of	25
all	25
who	25
knew	25
anything	25
of	25
his	25
mad	25
doings.	25
Six	25
days	25
did	25
Don	25
Quixote	25
keep	25
his	25
bed,	25
dejected,	25
melancholy,	25
moody	25
and	25
out	25
of	25
sorts,	25
brooding	25
over	25
the	25
unhappy	25
event	25
of	25
his	25
defeat.	25
Sancho	25
strove	25
to	25
comfort	25
him,	25
and	25
among	25
other	25
things	25
he	25
said	25
to	25
him,	25
“Hold	25
up	25
your	25
head,	25
señor,	25
and	25
be	25
of	25
good	25
cheer	25
if	25
you	25
can,	25
and	25
give	25
thanks	25
to	25
heaven	25
that	25
if	25
you	25
have	25
had	25
a	25
tumble	25
to	25
the	25
ground	25
you	25
have	25
not	25
come	25
off	25
with	25
a	25
broken	25
rib;	25
and,	25
as	25
you	25
know	25
that	25
‘where	25
they	25
give	25
they	25
take,’	25
and	25
that	25
‘there	25
are	25
not	25
always	25
fletches	25
where	25
there	25
are	25
pegs,’	25
a	25
fig	25
for	25
the	25
doctor,	25
for	25
there’s	25
no	25
need	25
of	25
him	25
to	25
cure	25
this	25
ailment.	25
Let	25
us	25
go	25
home,	25
and	25
give	25
over	25
going	25
about	25
in	25
search	25
of	25
adventures	25
in	25
strange	25
lands	25
and	25
places;	25
rightly	25
looked	25
at,	25
it	25
is	25
I	25
that	25
am	25
the	25
greater	25
loser,	25
though	25
it	25
is	25
your	25
worship	25
that	25
has	25
had	25
the	25
worse	25
usage.	25
With	25
the	25
government	25
I	25
gave	25
up	25
all	25
wish	25
to	25
be	25
a	25
governor	25
again,	25
but	25
I	25
did	25
not	25
give	25
up	25
all	25
longing	25
to	25
be	25
a	25
count;	25
and	25
that	25
will	25
never	25
come	25
to	25
pass	25
if	25
your	25
worship	25
gives	25
up	25
becoming	25
a	25
king	25
by	25
renouncing	25
the	25
calling	25
of	25
chivalry;	25
and	25
so	25
my	25
hopes	25
are	25
going	25
to	25
turn	25
into	25
smoke.”	25
“Peace,	25
Sancho,”	25
said	25
Don	25
Quixote;	25
“thou	25
seest	25
my	25
suspension	25
and	25
retirement	25
is	25
not	25
to	25
exceed	25
a	25
year;	25
I	25
shall	25
soon	25
return	25
to	25
my	25
honoured	25
calling,	25
and	25
I	25
shall	25
not	25
be	25
at	25
a	25
loss	25
for	25
a	25
kingdom	25
to	25
win	25
and	25
a	25
county	25
to	25
bestow	25
on	25
thee.”	25
“May	25
God	25
hear	25
it	25
and	25
sin	25
be	25
deaf,”	25
said	25
Sancho;	25
“I	25
have	25
always	25
heard	25
say	25
that	25
‘a	25
good	25
hope	25
is	25
better	25
than	25
a	25
bad	25
holding.”	25
As	25
they	25
were	25
talking	25
Don	25
Antonio	25
came	25
in	25
looking	25
extremely	25
pleased	25
and	25
exclaiming,	25
“Reward	25
me	25
for	25
my	25
good	25
news,	25
Señor	25
Don	25
Quixote!	25
Don	25
Gregorio	25
and	25
the	25
renegade	25
who	25
went	25
for	25
him	25
have	25
come	25
ashore—ashore	25
do	25
I	25
say?	25
They	25
are	25
by	25
this	25
time	25
in	25
the	25
viceroy’s	25
house,	25
and	25
will	25
be	25
here	25
immediately.”	25
Don	25
Quixote	25
cheered	25
up	25
a	25
little	25
and	25
said,	25
“Of	25
a	25
truth	25
I	25
am	25
almost	25
ready	25
to	25
say	25
I	25
should	25
have	25
been	25
glad	25
had	25
it	25
turned	25
out	25
just	25
the	25
other	25
way,	25
for	25
it	25
would	25
have	25
obliged	25
me	25
to	25
cross	25
over	25
to	25
Barbary,	25
where	25
by	25
the	25
might	25
of	25
my	25
arm	25
I	25
should	25
have	25
restored	25
to	25
liberty,	25
not	25
only	25
Don	25
Gregorio,	25
but	25
all	25
the	25
Christian	25
captives	25
there	25
are	25
in	25
Barbary.	25
But	25
what	25
am	25
I	25
saying,	25
miserable	25
being	25
that	25
I	25
am?	25
Am	25
I	25
not	25
he	25
that	25
has	25
been	25
conquered?	25
Am	25
I	25
not	25
he	25
that	25
has	25
been	25
overthrown?	25
Am	25
I	25
not	25
he	25
who	25
must	25
not	25
take	25
up	25
arms	25
for	25
a	25
year?	25
Then	25
what	25
am	25
I	25
making	25
professions	25
for;	25
what	25
am	25
I	25
bragging	25
about;	25
when	25
it	25
is	25
fitter	25
for	25
me	25
to	25
handle	25
the	25
distaff	25
than	25
the	25
sword?”	25
“No	25
more	25
of	25
that,	25
señor,”	25
said	25
Sancho;	25
“‘let	25
the	25
hen	25
live,	25
even	25
though	25
it	25
be	25
with	25
her	25
pip;’	25
‘to-day	25
for	25
thee	25
and	25
to-morrow	25
for	25
me;’	25
in	25
these	25
affairs	25
of	25
encounters	25
and	25
whacks	25
one	25
must	25
not	25
mind	25
them,	25
for	25
he	25
that	25
falls	25
to-day	25
may	25
get	25
up	25
to-morrow;	25
unless	25
indeed	25
he	25
chooses	25
to	25
lie	25
in	25
bed,	25
I	25
mean	25
gives	25
way	25
to	25
weakness	25
and	25
does	25
not	25
pluck	25
up	25
fresh	25
spirit	25
for	25
fresh	25
battles;	25
let	25
your	25
worship	25
get	25
up	25
now	25
to	25
receive	25
Don	25
Gregorio;	25
for	25
the	25
household	25
seems	25
to	25
be	25
in	25
a	25
bustle,	25
and	25
no	25
doubt	25
he	25
has	25
come	25
by	25
this	25
time;”	25
and	25
so	25
it	25
proved,	25
for	25
as	25
soon	25
as	25
Don	25
Gregorio	25
and	25
the	25
renegade	25
had	25
given	25
the	25
viceroy	25
an	25
account	25
of	25
the	25
voyage	25
out	25
and	25
home,	25
Don	25
Gregorio,	25
eager	25
to	25
see	25
Ana	25
Felix,	25
came	25
with	25
the	25
renegade	25
to	25
Don	25
Antonio’s	25
house.	25
When	25
they	25
carried	25
him	25
away	25
from	25
Algiers	25
he	25
was	25
in	25
woman’s	25
dress;	25
on	25
board	25
the	25
vessel,	25
however,	25
he	25
exchanged	25
it	25
for	25
that	25
of	25
a	25
captive	25
who	25
escaped	25
with	25
him;	25
but	25
in	25
whatever	25
dress	25
he	25
might	25
be	25
he	25
looked	25
like	25
one	25
to	25
be	25
loved	25
and	25
served	25
and	25
esteemed,	25
for	25
he	25
was	25
surpassingly	25
well-favoured,	25
and	25
to	25
judge	25
by	25
appearances	25
some	25
seventeen	25
or	25
eighteen	25
years	25
of	25
age.	25
Ricote	25
and	25
his	25
daughter	25
came	25
out	25
to	25
welcome	25
him,	25
the	25
father	25
with	25
tears,	25
the	25
daughter	25
with	25
bashfulness.	25
They	25
did	25
not	25
embrace	25
each	25
other,	25
for	25
where	25
there	25
is	25
deep	25
love	25
there	25
will	25
never	25
be	25
overmuch	25
boldness.	25
Seen	25
side	25
by	25
side,	25
the	25
comeliness	25
of	25
Don	25
Gregorio	25
and	25
the	25
beauty	25
of	25
Ana	25
Felix	25
were	25
the	25
admiration	25
of	25
all	25
who	25
were	25
present.	25
It	25
was	25
silence	25
that	25
spoke	25
for	25
the	25
lovers	25
at	25
that	25
moment,	25
and	25
their	25
eyes	25
were	25
the	25
tongues	25
that	25
declared	25
their	25
pure	25
and	25
happy	25
feelings.	25
The	25
renegade	25
explained	25
the	25
measures	25
and	25
means	25
he	25
had	25
adopted	25
to	25
rescue	25
Don	25
Gregorio,	25
and	25
Don	25
Gregorio	25
at	25
no	25
great	25
length,	25
but	25
in	25
a	25
few	25
words,	25
in	25
which	25
he	25
showed	25
that	25
his	25
intelligence	25
was	25
in	25
advance	25
of	25
his	25
years,	25
described	25
the	25
peril	25
and	25
embarrassment	25
he	25
found	25
himself	25
in	25
among	25
the	25
women	25
with	25
whom	25
he	25
had	25
sojourned.	25
To	25
conclude,	25
Ricote	25
liberally	25
recompensed	25
and	25
rewarded	25
as	25
well	25
the	25
renegade	25
as	25
the	25
men	25
who	25
had	25
rowed;	25
and	25
the	25
renegade	25
effected	25
his	25
readmission	25
into	25
the	25
body	25
of	25
the	25
Church	25
and	25
was	25
reconciled	25
with	25
it,	25
and	25
from	25
a	25
rotten	25
limb	25
became	25
by	25
penance	25
and	25
repentance	25
a	25
clean	25
and	25
sound	25
one.	25
Two	25
days	25
later	25
the	25
viceroy	25
discussed	25
with	25
Don	25
Antonio	25
the	25
steps	25
they	25
should	25
take	25
to	25
enable	25
Ana	25
Felix	25
and	25
her	25
father	25
to	25
stay	25
in	25
Spain,	25
for	25
it	25
seemed	25
to	25
them	25
there	25
could	25
be	25
no	25
objection	25
to	25
a	25
daughter	25
who	25
was	25
so	25
good	25
a	25
Christian	25
and	25
a	25
father	25
to	25
all	25
appearance	25
so	25
well	25
disposed	25
remaining	25
there.	25
Don	25
Antonio	25
offered	25
to	25
arrange	25
the	25
matter	25
at	25
the	25
capital,	25
whither	25
he	25
was	25
compelled	25
to	25
go	25
on	25
some	25
other	25
business,	25
hinting	25
that	25
many	25
a	25
difficult	25
affair	25
was	25
settled	25
there	25
with	25
the	25
help	25
of	25
favour	25
and	25
bribes.	25
“Nay,”	25
said	25
Ricote,	25
who	25
was	25
present	25
during	25
the	25
conversation,	25
“it	25
will	25
not	25
do	25
to	25
rely	25
upon	25
favour	25
or	25
bribes,	25
because	25
with	25
the	25
great	25
Don	25
Bernardino	25
de	25
Velasco,	25
Conde	25
de	25
Salazar,	25
to	25
whom	25
his	25
Majesty	25
has	25
entrusted	25
our	25
expulsion,	25
neither	25
entreaties	25
nor	25
promises,	25
bribes	25
nor	25
appeals	25
to	25
compassion,	25
are	25
of	25
any	25
use;	25
for	25
though	25
it	25
is	25
true	25
he	25
mingles	25
mercy	25
with	25
justice,	25
still,	25
seeing	25
that	25
the	25
whole	25
body	25
of	25
our	25
nation	25
is	25
tainted	25
and	25
corrupt,	25
he	25
applies	25
to	25
it	25
the	25
cautery	25
that	25
burns	25
rather	25
than	25
the	25
salve	25
that	25
soothes;	25
and	25
thus,	25
by	25
prudence,	25
sagacity,	25
care	25
and	25
the	25
fear	25
he	25
inspires,	25
he	25
has	25
borne	25
on	25
his	25
mighty	25
shoulders	25
the	25
weight	25
of	25
this	25
great	25
policy	25
and	25
carried	25
it	25
into	25
effect,	25
all	25
our	25
schemes	25
and	25
plots,	25
importunities	25
and	25
wiles,	25
being	25
ineffectual	25
to	25
blind	25
his	25
Argus	25
eyes,	25
ever	25
on	25
the	25
watch	25
lest	25
one	25
of	25
us	25
should	25
remain	25
behind	25
in	25
concealment,	25
and	25
like	25
a	25
hidden	25
root	25
come	25
in	25
course	25
of	25
time	25
to	25
sprout	25
and	25
bear	25
poisonous	25
fruit	25
in	25
Spain,	25
now	25
cleansed,	25
and	25
relieved	25
of	25
the	25
fear	25
in	25
which	25
our	25
vast	25
numbers	25
kept	25
it.	25
Heroic	25
resolve	25
of	25
the	25
great	25
Philip	25
the	25
Third,	25
and	25
unparalleled	25
wisdom	25
to	25
have	25
entrusted	25
it	25
to	25
the	25
said	25
Don	25
Bernardino	25
de	25
Velasco!”	25
“At	25
any	25
rate,”	25
said	25
Don	25
Antonio,	25
“when	25
I	25
am	25
there	25
I	25
will	25
make	25
all	25
possible	25
efforts,	25
and	25
let	25
heaven	25
do	25
as	25
pleases	25
it	25
best;	25
Don	25
Gregorio	25
will	25
come	25
with	25
me	25
to	25
relieve	25
the	25
anxiety	25
which	25
his	25
parents	25
must	25
be	25
suffering	25
on	25
account	25
of	25
his	25
absence;	25
Ana	25
Felix	25
will	25
remain	25
in	25
my	25
house	25
with	25
my	25
wife,	25
or	25
in	25
a	25
monastery;	25
and	25
I	25
know	25
the	25
viceroy	25
will	25
be	25
glad	25
that	25
the	25
worthy	25
Ricote	25
should	25
stay	25
with	25
him	25
until	25
we	25
see	25
what	25
terms	25
I	25
can	25
make.”	25
The	25
viceroy	25
agreed	25
to	25
all	25
that	25
was	25
proposed;	25
but	25
Don	25
Gregorio	25
on	25
learning	25
what	25
had	25
passed	25
declared	25
he	25
could	25
not	25
and	25
would	25
not	25
on	25
any	25
account	25
leave	25
Ana	25
Felix;	25
however,	25
as	25
it	25
was	25
his	25
purpose	25
to	25
go	25
and	25
see	25
his	25
parents	25
and	25
devise	25
some	25
way	25
of	25
returning	25
for	25
her,	25
he	25
fell	25
in	25
with	25
the	25
proposed	25
arrangement.	25
Ana	25
Felix	25
remained	25
with	25
Don	25
Antonio’s	25
wife,	25
and	25
Ricote	25
in	25
the	25
viceroy’s	25
house.	25
The	25
day	25
for	25
Don	25
Antonio’s	25
departure	25
came;	25
and	25
two	25
days	25
later	25
that	25
for	25
Don	25
Quixote’s	25
and	25
Sancho’s,	25
for	25
Don	25
Quixote’s	25
fall	25
did	25
not	25
suffer	25
him	25
to	25
take	25
the	25
road	25
sooner.	25
There	25
were	25
tears	25
and	25
sighs,	25
swoonings	25
and	25
sobs,	25
at	25
the	25
parting	25
between	25
Don	25
Gregorio	25
and	25
Ana	25
Felix.	25
Ricote	25
offered	25
Don	25
Gregorio	25
a	25
thousand	25
crowns	25
if	25
he	25
would	25
have	25
them,	25
but	25
he	25
would	25
not	25
take	25
any	25
save	25
five	25
which	25
Don	25
Antonio	25
lent	25
him	25
and	25
he	25
promised	25
to	25
repay	25
at	25
the	25
capital.	25
So	25
the	25
two	25
of	25
them	25
took	25
their	25
departure,	25
and	25
Don	25
Quixote	25
and	25
Sancho	25
afterwards,	25
as	25
has	25
been	25
already	25
said,	25
Don	25
Quixote	25
without	25
his	25
armour	25
and	25

As	25
he	25
left	25
Barcelona,	25
Don	25
Quixote	25
turned	25
gaze	25
upon	25
the	25
spot	25
where	25
he	25
had	25
fallen.	25
“Here	25
Troy	25
was,”	25
said	25
he;	25
“here	25
my	25
ill-luck,	25
not	25
my	25
cowardice,	25
robbed	25
me	25
of	25
all	25
the	25
glory	25
I	25
had	25
won;	25
here	25
Fortune	25
made	25
me	25
the	25
victim	25
of	25
her	25
caprices;	25
here	25
the	25
lustre	25
of	25
my	25
achievements	25
was	25
dimmed;	25
here,	25
in	25
a	25
word,	25
fell	25
my	25
happiness	25
never	25
to	25
rise	25
again.”	25

“Señor,”	25
said	25
Sancho	25
on	25
hearing	25
this,	25
“it	25
is	25
the	25
part	25
of	25
brave	25
hearts	25
to	25
be	25
patient	25
in	25
adversity	25
just	25
as	25
much	25
as	25
to	25
be	25
glad	25
in	25
prosperity;	25
I	25
judge	25
by	25
myself,	25
for,	25
if	25
when	25
I	25
was	25
a	25
governor	25
I	25
was	25
glad,	25
now	25
that	25
I	25
am	25
a	25
squire	25
and	25
on	25
foot	25
I	25
am	25
not	25
sad;	25
and	25
I	25
have	25
heard	25
say	25
that	25
she	25
whom	25
commonly	25
they	25
call	25
Fortune	25
is	25
a	25
drunken	25
whimsical	25
jade,	25
and,	25
what	25
is	25
more,	25
blind,	25
and	25
therefore	25
neither	25
sees	25
what	25
she	25
does,	25
nor	25
knows	25
whom	25
she	25
casts	25
down	25
or	25
whom	25
she	25
sets	25
up.”	25
“Thou	25
art	25
a	25
great	25
philosopher,	25
Sancho,”	25
said	25
Don	25
Quixote;	25
“thou	25
speakest	25
very	25
sensibly;	25
I	25
know	25
not	25
who	25
taught	25
thee.	25
But	25
I	25
can	25
tell	25
thee	25
there	25
is	25
no	25
such	25
thing	25
as	25
Fortune	25
in	25
the	25
world,	25
nor	25
does	25
anything	25
which	25
takes	25
place	25
there,	25
be	25
it	25
good	25
or	25
bad,	25
come	25
about	25
by	25
chance,	25
but	25
by	25
the	25
special	25
preordination	25
of	25
heaven;	25
and	25
hence	25
the	25
common	25
saying	25
that	25
‘each	25
of	25
us	25
is	25
the	25
maker	25
of	25
his	25
own	25
Fortune.’	25
I	25
have	25
been	25
that	25
of	25
mine;	25
but	25
not	25
with	25
the	25
proper	25
amount	25
of	25
prudence,	25
and	25
my	25
self-confidence	25
has	25
therefore	25
made	25
me	25
pay	25
dearly;	25
for	25
I	25
ought	25
to	25
have	25
reflected	25
that	25
Rocinante’s	25
feeble	25
strength	25
could	25
not	25
resist	25
the	25
mighty	25
bulk	25
of	25
the	25
Knight	25
of	25
the	25
White	25
Moon’s	25
horse.	25
In	25
a	25
word,	25
I	25
ventured	25
it,	25
I	25
did	25
my	25
best,	25
I	25
was	25
overthrown,	25
but	25
though	25
I	25
lost	25
my	25
honour	25
I	25
did	25
not	25
lose	25
nor	25
can	25
I	25
lose	25
the	25
virtue	25
of	25
keeping	25
my	25
word.	25
When	25
I	25
was	25
a	25
knight-errant,	25
daring	25
and	25
valiant,	25
I	25
supported	25
my	25
achievements	25
by	25
hand	25
and	25
deed,	25
and	25
now	25
that	25
I	25
am	25
a	25
humble	25
squire	25
I	25
will	25
support	25
my	25
words	25
by	25
keeping	25
the	25
promise	25
I	25
have	25
given.	25
Forward	25
then,	25
Sancho	25
my	25
friend,	25
let	25
us	25
go	25
to	25
keep	25
the	25
year	25
of	25
the	25
novitiate	25
in	25
our	25
own	25
country,	25
and	25
in	25
that	25
seclusion	25
we	25
shall	25
pick	25
up	25
fresh	25
strength	25
to	25
return	25
to	25
the	25
by	25
me	25
never-forgotten	25
calling	25
of	25
arms.”	25
“Señor,”	25
returned	25
Sancho,	25
“travelling	25
on	25
foot	25
is	25
not	25
such	25
a	25
pleasant	25
thing	25
that	25
it	25
makes	25
me	25
feel	25
disposed	25
or	25
tempted	25
to	25
make	25
long	25
marches.	25
Let	25
us	25
leave	25
this	25
armour	25
hung	25
up	25
on	25
some	25
tree,	25
instead	25
of	25
someone	25
that	25
has	25
been	25
hanged;	25
and	25
then	25
with	25
me	25
on	25
Dapple’s	25
back	25
and	25
my	25
feet	25
off	25
the	25
ground	25
we	25
will	25
arrange	25
the	25
stages	25
as	25
your	25
worship	25
pleases	25
to	25
measure	25
them	25
out;	25
but	25
to	25
suppose	25
that	25
I	25
am	25
going	25
to	25
travel	25
on	25
foot,	25
and	25
make	25
long	25
ones,	25
is	25
to	25
suppose	25
nonsense.”	25
“Thou	25
sayest	25
well,	25
Sancho,”	25
said	25
Don	25
Quixote;	25
“let	25
my	25
armour	25
be	25
hung	25
up	25
for	25
a	25
trophy,	25
and	25
under	25
it	25
or	25
round	25
it	25
we	25
will	25
carve	25
on	25
the	25
trees	25
what	25
was	25
inscribed	25
on	25
the	25
trophy	25
of	25
Roland’s	25
armour-	25
These	25
let	25
none	25
move	25
Who	25
dareth	25
not	25
his	25
might	25
with	25
Roland	25
prove.”	25
“That’s	25
the	25
very	25
thing,”	25
said	25
Sancho;	25
“and	25
if	25
it	25
was	25
not	25
that	25
we	25
should	25
feel	25
the	25
want	25
of	25
Rocinante	25
on	25
the	25
road,	25
it	25
would	25
be	25
as	25
well	25
to	25
leave	25
him	25
hung	25
up	25
too.”	25
“And	25
yet,	25
I	25
had	25
rather	25
not	25
have	25
either	25
him	25
or	25
the	25
armour	25
hung	25
up,”	25
said	25
Don	25
Quixote,	25
“that	25
it	25
may	25
not	25
be	25
said,	25
‘for	25
good	25
service	25
a	25
bad	25
return.’”	25
“Your	25
worship	25
is	25
right,”	25
said	25
Sancho;	25
“for,	25
as	25
sensible	25
people	25
hold,	25
‘the	25
fault	25
of	25
the	25
ass	25
must	25
not	25
be	25
laid	25
on	25
the	25
pack-saddle;’	25
and,	25
as	25
in	25
this	25
affair	25
the	25
fault	25
is	25
your	25
worship’s,	25
punish	25
yourself	25
and	25
don’t	25
let	25
your	25
anger	25
break	25
out	25
against	25
the	25
already	25
battered	25
and	25
bloody	25
armour,	25
or	25
the	25
meekness	25
of	25
Rocinante,	25
or	25
the	25
tenderness	25
of	25
my	25
feet,	25
trying	25
to	25
make	25
them	25
travel	25
more	25
than	25
is	25
reasonable.”	25

In	25
converse	25
of	25
this	25
sort	25
the	25
whole	25
of	25
that	25
day	25
went	25
by,	25
as	25
did	25
the	25
four	25
succeeding	25
ones,	25
without	25
anything	25
occurring	25
to	25
interrupt	25
their	25
journey,	25
but	25
on	25
the	25
fifth	25
as	25
they	25
entered	25
a	25
village	25
they	25
found	25
a	25
great	25
number	25
of	25
people	25
at	25
the	25
door	25
of	25
an	25
inn	25
enjoying	25
themselves,	25
as	25
it	25
was	25
a	25
holiday.	25
Upon	25
Don	25
Quixote’s	25
approach	25
a	25
peasant	25
called	25
out,	25
“One	25
of	25
these	25
two	25
gentlemen	25
who	25
come	25
here,	25
and	25
who	25
don’t	25
know	25
the	25
parties,	25
will	25
tell	25
us	25
what	25
we	25
ought	25
to	25
do	25
about	25
our	25
wager.”	25
“That	25
I	25
will,	25
certainly,”	25
said	25
Don	25
Quixote,	25
“and	25
according	25
to	25
the	25
rights	25
of	25
the	25
case,	25
if	25
I	25
can	25
manage	25
to	25
understand	25
it.”	25
“Well,	25
here	25
it	25
is,	25
worthy	25
sir,”	25
said	25
the	25
peasant;	25
“a	25
man	25
of	25
this	25
village	25
who	25
is	25
so	25
fat	25
that	25
he	25
weighs	25
twenty	25
stone	25
challenged	25
another,	25
a	25
neighbour	25
of	25
his,	25
who	25
does	25
not	25
weigh	25
more	25
than	25
nine,	25
to	25
run	25
a	25
race.	25
The	25
agreement	25
was	25
that	25
they	25
were	25
to	25
run	25
a	25
distance	25
of	25
a	25
hundred	25
paces	25
with	25
equal	25
weights;	25
and	25
when	25
the	25
challenger	25
was	25
asked	25
how	25
the	25
weights	25
were	25
to	25
be	25
equalised	25
he	25
said	25
that	25
the	25
other,	25
as	25
he	25
weighed	25
nine	25
stone,	25
should	25
put	25
eleven	25
in	25
iron	25
on	25
his	25
back,	25
and	25
that	25
in	25
this	25
way	25
the	25
twenty	25
stone	25
of	25
the	25
thin	25
man	25
would	25
equal	25
the	25
twenty	25
stone	25
of	25
the	25
fat	25
one.”	25
“Not	25
at	25
all,”	25
exclaimed	25
Sancho	25
at	25
once,	25
before	25
Don	25
Quixote	25
could	25
answer;	25
“it’s	25
for	25
me,	25
that	25
only	25
a	25
few	25
days	25
ago	25
left	25
off	25
being	25
a	25
governor	25
and	25
a	25
judge,	25
as	25
all	25
the	25
world	25
knows,	25
to	25
settle	25
these	25
doubtful	25
questions	25
and	25
give	25
an	25
opinion	25
in	25
disputes	25
of	25
all	25
sorts.”	25
“Answer	25
in	25
God’s	25
name,	25
Sancho	25
my	25
friend,”	25
said	25
Don	25
Quixote,	25
“for	25
I	25
am	25
not	25
fit	25
to	25
give	25
crumbs	25
to	25
a	25
cat,	25
my	25
wits	25
are	25
so	25
confused	25
and	25
upset.”	25
With	25
this	25
permission	25
Sancho	25
said	25
to	25
the	25
peasants	25
who	25
stood	25
clustered	25
round	25
him,	25
waiting	25
with	25
open	25
mouths	25
for	25
the	25
decision	25
to	25
come	25
from	25
his,	25
“Brothers,	25
what	25
the	25
fat	25
man	25
requires	25
is	25
not	25
in	25
reason,	25
nor	25
has	25
it	25
a	25
shadow	25
of	25
justice	25
in	25
it;	25
because,	25
if	25
it	25
be	25
true,	25
as	25
they	25
say,	25
that	25
the	25
challenged	25
may	25
choose	25
the	25
weapons,	25
the	25
other	25
has	25
no	25
right	25
to	25
choose	25
such	25
as	25
will	25
prevent	25
and	25
keep	25
him	25
from	25
winning.	25
My	25
decision,	25
therefore,	25
is	25
that	25
the	25
fat	25
challenger	25
prune,	25
peel,	25
thin,	25
trim	25
and	25
correct	25
himself,	25
and	25
take	25
eleven	25
stone	25
of	25
his	25
flesh	25
off	25
his	25
body,	25
here	25
or	25
there,	25
as	25
he	25
pleases,	25
and	25
as	25
suits	25
him	25
best;	25
and	25
being	25
in	25
this	25
way	25
reduced	25
to	25
nine	25
stone	25
weight,	25
he	25
will	25
make	25
himself	25
equal	25
and	25
even	25
with	25
nine	25
stone	25
of	25
his	25
opponent,	25
and	25
they	25
will	25
be	25
able	25
to	25
run	25
on	25
equal	25
terms.”	25
“By	25
all	25
that’s	25
good,”	25
said	25
one	25
of	25
the	25
peasants	25
as	25
he	25
heard	25
Sancho’s	25
decision,	25
“but	25
the	25
gentleman	25
has	25
spoken	25
like	25
a	25
saint,	25
and	25
given	25
judgment	25
like	25
a	25
canon!	25
But	25
I’ll	25
be	25
bound	25
the	25
fat	25
man	25
won’t	25
part	25
with	25
an	25
ounce	25
of	25
his	25
flesh,	25
not	25
to	25
say	25
eleven	25
stone.”	25
“The	25
best	25
plan	25
will	25
be	25
for	25
them	25
not	25
to	25
run,”	25
said	25
another,	25
“so	25
that	25
neither	25
the	25
thin	25
man	25
break	25
down	25
under	25
the	25
weight,	25
nor	25
the	25
fat	25
one	25
strip	25
himself	25
of	25
his	25
flesh;	25
let	25
half	25
the	25
wager	25
be	25
spent	25
in	25
wine,	25
and	25
let’s	25
take	25
these	25
gentlemen	25
to	25
the	25
tavern	25
where	25
there’s	25
the	25
best,	25
and	25
‘over	25
me	25
be	25
the	25
cloak	25
when	25
it	25
rains.”	25
“I	25
thank	25
you,	25
sirs,”	25
said	25
Don	25
Quixote;	25
“but	25
I	25
cannot	25
stop	25
for	25
an	25
instant,	25
for	25
sad	25
thoughts	25
and	25
unhappy	25
circumstances	25
force	25
me	25
to	25
seem	25
discourteous	25
and	25
to	25
travel	25
apace;”	25
and	25
spurring	25
Rocinante	25
he	25
pushed	25
on,	25
leaving	25
them	25
wondering	25
at	25
what	25
they	25
had	25
seen	25
and	25
heard,	25
at	25
his	25
own	25
strange	25
figure	25
and	25
at	25
the	25
shrewdness	25
of	25
his	25
servant,	25
for	25
such	25
they	25
took	25
Sancho	25
to	25
be;	25
and	25
another	25
of	25
them	25
observed,	25
“If	25
the	25
servant	25
is	25
so	25
clever,	25
what	25
must	25
the	25
master	25
be?	25
I’ll	25
bet,	25
if	25
they	25
are	25
going	25
to	25
Salamanca	25
to	25
study,	25
they’ll	25
come	25
to	25
be	25
alcaldes	25
of	25
the	25
Court	25
in	25
a	25
trice;	25
for	25
it’s	25
a	25
mere	25
joke—only	25
to	25
read	25
and	25
read,	25
and	25
have	25
interest	25
and	25
good	25
luck;	25
and	25
before	25
a	25
man	25
knows	25
where	25
he	25
is	25
he	25
finds	25
himself	25
with	25
a	25
staff	25
in	25
his	25
hand	25
or	25
a	25
mitre	25
on	25
his	25
head.”	25
That	25
night	25
master	25
and	25
man	25
passed	25
out	25
in	25
the	25
fields	25
in	25
the	25
open	25
air,	25
and	25
the	25
next	25
day	25
as	25
they	25
were	25
pursuing	25
their	25
journey	25
they	25
saw	25
coming	25
towards	25
them	25
a	25
man	25
on	25
foot	25
with	25
alforjas	25
at	25
the	25
neck	25
and	25
a	25
javelin	25
or	25
spiked	25
staff	25
in	25
his	25
hand,	25
the	25
very	25
cut	25
of	25
a	25
foot	25
courier;	25
who,	25
as	25
soon	25
as	25
he	25
came	25
close	25
to	25
Don	25
Quixote,	25
increased	25
his	25
pace	25
and	25
half	25
running	25
came	25
up	25
to	25
him,	25
and	25
embracing	25
his	25
right	25
thigh,	25
for	25
he	25
could	25
reach	25
no	25
higher,	25
exclaimed	25
with	25
evident	25
pleasure,	25
“O	25
Señor	25
Don	25
Quixote	25
of	25
La	25
Mancha,	25
what	25
happiness	25
it	25
will	25
be	25
to	25
the	25
heart	25
of	25
my	25
lord	25
the	25
duke	25
when	25
he	25
knows	25
your	25
worship	25
is	25
coming	25
back	25
to	25
his	25
castle,	25
for	25
he	25
is	25
still	25
there	25
with	25
my	25
lady	25
the	25
duchess!”	25
“I	25
do	25
not	25
recognise	25
you,	25
friend,”	25
said	25
Don	25
Quixote,	25
“nor	25
do	25
I	25
know	25
who	25
you	25
are,	25
unless	25
you	25
tell	25
me.”	25
“I	25
am	25
Tosilos,	25
my	25
lord	25
the	25
duke’s	25
lacquey,	25
Señor	25
Don	25
Quixote,”	25
replied	25
the	25
courier;	25
“he	25
who	25
refused	25
to	25
fight	25
your	25
worship	25
about	25
marrying	25
the	25
daughter	25
of	25
Doña	25
Rodriguez.”	25
“God	25
bless	25
me!”	25
exclaimed	25
Don	25
Quixote;	25
“is	25
it	25
possible	25
that	25
you	25
are	25
the	25
one	25
whom	25
mine	25
enemies	25
the	25
enchanters	25
changed	25
into	25
the	25
lacquey	25
you	25
speak	25
of	25
in	25
order	25
to	25
rob	25
me	25
of	25
the	25
honour	25
of	25
that	25
battle?”	25
“Nonsense,	25
good	25
sir!”	25
said	25
the	25
messenger;	25
“there	25
was	25
no	25
enchantment	25
or	25
transformation	25
at	25
all;	25
I	25
entered	25
the	25
lists	25
just	25
as	25
much	25
lacquey	25
Tosilos	25
as	25
I	25
came	25
out	25
of	25
them	25
lacquey	25
Tosilos.	25
I	25
thought	25
to	25
marry	25
without	25
fighting,	25
for	25
the	25
girl	25
had	25
taken	25
my	25
fancy;	25
but	25
my	25
scheme	25
had	25
a	25
very	25
different	25
result,	25
for	25
as	25
soon	25
as	25
your	25
worship	25
had	25
left	25
the	25
castle	25
my	25
lord	25
the	25
duke	25
had	25
a	25
hundred	25
strokes	25
of	25
the	25
stick	25
given	25
me	25
for	25
having	25
acted	25
contrary	25
to	25
the	25
orders	25
he	25
gave	25
me	25
before	25
engaging	25
in	25
the	25
combat;	25
and	25
the	25
end	25
of	25
the	25
whole	25
affair	25
is	25
that	25
the	25
girl	25
has	25
become	25
a	25
nun,	25
and	25
Doña	25
Rodriguez	25
has	25
gone	25
back	25
to	25
Castile,	25
and	25
I	25
am	25
now	25
on	25
my	25
way	25
to	25
Barcelona	25
with	25
a	25
packet	25
of	25
letters	25
for	25
the	25
viceroy	25
which	25
my	25
master	25
is	25
sending	25
him.	25
If	25
your	25
worship	25
would	25
like	25
a	25
drop,	25
sound	25
though	25
warm,	25
I	25
have	25
a	25
gourd	25
here	25
full	25
of	25
the	25
best,	25
and	25
some	25
scraps	25
of	25
Tronchon	25
cheese	25
that	25
will	25
serve	25
as	25
a	25
provocative	25
and	25
wakener	25
of	25
your	25
thirst	25
if	25
so	25
be	25
it	25
is	25
asleep.”	25
“I	25
take	25
the	25
offer,”	25
said	25
Sancho;	25
“no	25
more	25
compliments	25
about	25
it;	25
pour	25
out,	25
good	25
Tosilos,	25
in	25
spite	25
of	25
all	25
the	25
enchanters	25
in	25
the	25
Indies.”	25
“Thou	25
art	25
indeed	25
the	25
greatest	25
glutton	25
in	25
the	25
world,	25
Sancho,”	25
said	25
Don	25
Quixote,	25
“and	25
the	25
greatest	25
booby	25
on	25
earth,	25
not	25
to	25
be	25
able	25
to	25
see	25
that	25
this	25
courier	25
is	25
enchanted	25
and	25
this	25
Tosilos	25
a	25
sham	25
one;	25
stop	25
with	25
him	25
and	25
take	25
thy	25
fill;	25
I	25
will	25
go	25
on	25
slowly	25
and	25
wait	25
for	25
thee	25
to	25
come	25
up	25
with	25
me.”	25
The	25
lacquey	25
laughed,	25
unsheathed	25
his	25
gourd,	25
unwalletted	25
his	25
scraps,	25
and	25
taking	25
out	25
a	25
small	25
loaf	25
of	25
bread	25
he	25
and	25
Sancho	25
seated	25
themselves	25
on	25
the	25
green	25
grass,	25
and	25
in	25
peace	25
and	25
good	25
fellowship	25
finished	25
off	25
the	25
contents	25
of	25
the	25
alforjas	25
down	25
to	25
the	25
bottom,	25
so	25
resolutely	25
that	25
they	25
licked	25
the	25
wrapper	25
of	25
the	25
letters,	25
merely	25
because	25
it	25
smelt	25
of	25
cheese.	25
Said	25
Tosilos	25
to	25
Sancho,	25
“Beyond	25
a	25
doubt,	25
Sancho	25
my	25
friend,	25
this	25
master	25
of	25
thine	25
ought	25
to	25
be	25
a	25
madman.”	25
“Ought!”	25
said	25
Sancho;	25
“he	25
owes	25
no	25
man	25
anything;	25
he	25
pays	25
for	25
everything,	25
particularly	25
when	25
the	25
coin	25
is	25
madness.	25
I	25
see	25
it	25
plain	25
enough,	25
and	25
I	25
tell	25
him	25
so	25
plain	25
enough;	25
but	25
what’s	25
the	25
use?	25
especially	25
now	25
that	25
it	25
is	25
all	25
over	25
with	25
him,	25
for	25
here	25
he	25
is	25
beaten	25
by	25
the	25
Knight	25
of	25
the	25
White	25
Moon.”	25
Tosilos	25
begged	25
him	25
to	25
explain	25
what	25
had	25
happened	25
him,	25
but	25
Sancho	25
replied	25
that	25
it	25
would	25
not	25
be	25
good	25
manners	25
to	25
leave	25
his	25
master	25
waiting	25
for	25
him;	25
and	25
that	25
some	25
other	25
day	25
if	25
they	25
met	25
there	25
would	25
be	25
time	25
enough	25
for	25
that;	25
and	25
then	25
getting	25
up,	25
after	25
shaking	25
his	25
doublet	25
and	25
brushing	25
the	25
crumbs	25
out	25
of	25
his	25
beard,	25
he	25
drove	25
Dapple	25
on	25
before	25
him,	25
and	25
bidding	25
adieu	25
to	25
Tosilos	25
left	25
him	25
and	25
rejoined	25
his	25
master,	25
who	25
was	25
waiting	25
for	25
him	25
under	25
the	25
shade	25
of	25
a	25
tree.	25

If	25
a	25
multitude	25
of	25
reflections	25
used	25
to	25
harass	25
Don	25
Quixote	25
before	25
he	25
had	25
been	25
overthrown,	25
a	25
great	25
many	25
more	25
harassed	25
him	25
since	25
his	25
fall.	25
He	25
was	25
under	25
the	25
shade	25
of	25
a	25
tree,	25
as	25
has	25
been	25
said,	25
and	25
there,	25
like	25
flies	25
on	25
honey,	25
thoughts	25
came	25
crowding	25
upon	25
him	25
and	25
stinging	25
him.	25
Some	25
of	25
them	25
turned	25
upon	25
the	25
disenchantment	25
of	25
Dulcinea,	25
others	25
upon	25
the	25
life	25
he	25
was	25
about	25
to	25
lead	25
in	25
his	25
enforced	25
retirement.	25
Sancho	25
came	25
up	25
and	25
spoke	25
in	25
high	25
praise	25
of	25
the	25
generous	25
disposition	25
of	25
the	25
lacquey	25
Tosilos.	25
“Is	25
it	25
possible,	25
Sancho,”	25
said	25
Don	25
Quixote,	25
“that	25
thou	25
dost	25
still	25
think	25
that	25
he	25
yonder	25
is	25
a	25
real	25
lacquey?	25
Apparently	25
it	25
has	25
escaped	25
thy	25
memory	25
that	25
thou	25
hast	25
seen	25
Dulcinea	25
turned	25
and	25
transformed	25
into	25
a	25
peasant	25
wench,	25
and	25
the	25
Knight	25
of	25
the	25
Mirrors	25
into	25
the	25
bachelor	25
Carrasco;	25
all	25
the	25
work	25
of	25
the	25
enchanters	25
that	25
persecute	25
me.	25
But	25
tell	25
me	25
now,	25
didst	25
thou	25
ask	25
this	25
Tosilos,	25
as	25
thou	25
callest	25
him,	25
what	25
has	25
become	25
of	25
Altisidora,	25
did	25
she	25
weep	25
over	25
my	25
absence,	25
or	25
has	25
she	25
already	25
consigned	25
to	25
oblivion	25
the	25
love	25
thoughts	25
that	25
used	25
to	25
afflict	25
her	25
when	25
I	25
was	25
present?”	25
“The	25
thoughts	25
that	25
I	25
had,”	25
said	25
Sancho,	25
“were	25
not	25
such	25
as	25
to	25
leave	25
time	25
for	25
asking	25
fool’s	25
questions.	25
Body	25
o’	25
me,	25
señor!	25
is	25
your	25
worship	25
in	25
a	25
condition	25
now	25
to	25
inquire	25
into	25
other	25
people’s	25
thoughts,	25
above	25
all	25
love	25
thoughts?”	25
“Look	25
ye,	25
Sancho,”	25
said	25
Don	25
Quixote,	25
“there	25
is	25
a	25
great	25
difference	25
between	25
what	25
is	25
done	25
out	25
of	25
love	25
and	25
what	25
is	25
done	25
out	25
of	25
gratitude.	25
A	25
knight	25
may	25
very	25
possibly	25
be	25
proof	25
against	25
love;	25
but	25
it	25
is	25
impossible,	25
strictly	25
speaking,	25
for	25
him	25
to	25
be	25
ungrateful.	25
Altisidora,	25
to	25
all	25
appearance,	25
loved	25
me	25
truly;	25
she	25
gave	25
me	25
the	25
three	25
kerchiefs	25
thou	25
knowest	25
of;	25
she	25
wept	25
at	25
my	25
departure,	25
she	25
cursed	25
me,	25
she	25
abused	25
me,	25
casting	25
shame	25
to	25
the	25
winds	25
she	25
bewailed	25
herself	25
in	25
public;	25
all	25
signs	25
that	25
she	25
adored	25
me;	25
for	25
the	25
wrath	25
of	25
lovers	25
always	25
ends	25
in	25
curses.	25
I	25
had	25
no	25
hopes	25
to	25
give	25
her,	25
nor	25
treasures	25
to	25
offer	25
her,	25
for	25
mine	25
are	25
given	25
to	25
Dulcinea,	25
and	25
the	25
treasures	25
of	25
knights-errant	25
are	25
like	25
those	25
of	25
the	25
fairies,’	25
illusory	25
and	25
deceptive;	25
all	25
I	25
can	25
give	25
her	25
is	25
the	25
place	25
in	25
my	25
memory	25
I	25
keep	25
for	25
her,	25
without	25
prejudice,	25
however,	25
to	25
that	25
which	25
I	25
hold	25
devoted	25
to	25
Dulcinea,	25
whom	25
thou	25
art	25
wronging	25
by	25
thy	25
remissness	25
in	25
whipping	25
thyself	25
and	25
scourging	25
that	25
flesh—would	25
that	25
I	25
saw	25
it	25
eaten	25
by	25
wolves—which	25
would	25
rather	25
keep	25
itself	25
for	25
the	25
worms	25
than	25
for	25
the	25
relief	25
of	25
that	25
poor	25
lady.”	25
“Señor,”	25
replied	25
Sancho,	25
“if	25
the	25
truth	25
is	25
to	25
be	25
told,	25
I	25
cannot	25
persuade	25
myself	25
that	25
the	25
whipping	25
of	25
my	25
backside	25
has	25
anything	25
to	25
do	25
with	25
the	25
disenchantment	25
of	25
the	25
enchanted;	25
it	25
is	25
like	25
saying,	25
‘If	25
your	25
head	25
aches	25
rub	25
ointment	25
on	25
your	25
knees;’	25
at	25
any	25
rate	25
I’ll	25
make	25
bold	25
to	25
swear	25
that	25
in	25
all	25
the	25
histories	25
dealing	25
with	25
knight-errantry	25
that	25
your	25
worship	25
has	25
read	25
you	25
have	25
never	25
come	25
across	25
anybody	25
disenchanted	25
by	25
whipping;	25
but	25
whether	25
or	25
no	25
I’ll	25
whip	25
myself	25
when	25
I	25
have	25
a	25
fancy	25
for	25
it,	25
and	25
the	25
opportunity	25
serves	25
for	25
scourging	25
myself	25
comfortably.”	25
“God	25
grant	25
it,”	25
said	25
Don	25
Quixote;	25
“and	25
heaven	25
give	25
thee	25
grace	25
to	25
take	25
it	25
to	25
heart	25
and	25
own	25
the	25
obligation	25
thou	25
art	25
under	25
to	25
help	25
my	25
lady,	25
who	25
is	25
thine	25
also,	25
inasmuch	25
as	25
thou	25
art	25
mine.”	25
As	25
they	25
pursued	25
their	25
journey	25
talking	25
in	25
this	25
way	25
they	25
came	25
to	25
the	25
very	25
same	25
spot	25
where	25
they	25
had	25
been	25
trampled	25
on	25
by	25
the	25
bulls.	25
Don	25
Quixote	25
recognised	25
it,	25
and	25
said	25
he	25
to	25
Sancho,	25
“This	25
is	25
the	25
meadow	25
where	25
we	25
came	25
upon	25
those	25
gay	25
shepherdesses	25
and	25
gallant	25
shepherds	25
who	25
were	25
trying	25
to	25
revive	25
and	25
imitate	25
the	25
pastoral	25
Arcadia	25
there,	25
an	25
idea	25
as	25
novel	25
as	25
it	25
was	25
happy,	25
in	25
emulation	25
whereof,	25
if	25
so	25
be	25
thou	25
dost	25
approve	25
of	25
it,	25
Sancho,	25
I	25
would	25
have	25
ourselves	25
turn	25
shepherds,	25
at	25
any	25
rate	25
for	25
the	25
time	25
I	25
have	25
to	25
live	25
in	25
retirement.	25
I	25
will	25
buy	25
some	25
ewes	25
and	25
everything	25
else	25
requisite	25
for	25
the	25
pastoral	25
calling;	25
and,	25
I	25
under	25
the	25
name	25
of	25
the	25
shepherd	25
Quixotize	25
and	25
thou	25
as	25
the	25
shepherd	25
Panzino,	25
we	25
will	25
roam	25
the	25
woods	25
and	25
groves	25
and	25
meadows	25
singing	25
songs	25
here,	25
lamenting	25
in	25
elegies	25
there,	25
drinking	25
of	25
the	25
crystal	25
waters	25
of	25
the	25
springs	25
or	25
limpid	25
brooks	25
or	25
flowing	25
rivers.	25
The	25
oaks	25
will	25
yield	25
us	25
their	25
sweet	25
fruit	25
with	25
bountiful	25
hand,	25
the	25
trunks	25
of	25
the	25
hard	25
cork	25
trees	25
a	25
seat,	25
the	25
willows	25
shade,	25
the	25
roses	25
perfume,	25
the	25
widespread	25
meadows	25
carpets	25
tinted	25
with	25
a	25
thousand	25
dyes;	25
the	25
clear	25
pure	25
air	25
will	25
give	25
us	25
breath,	25
the	25
moon	25
and	25
stars	25
lighten	25
the	25
darkness	25
of	25
the	25
night	25
for	25
us,	25
song	25
shall	25
be	25
our	25
delight,	25
lamenting	25
our	25
joy,	25
Apollo	25
will	25
supply	25
us	25
with	25
verses,	25
and	25
love	25
with	25
conceits	25
whereby	25
we	25
shall	25
make	25
ourselves	25
famed	25
for	25
ever,	25
not	25
only	25
in	25
this	25
but	25
in	25
ages	25
to	25
come.”	25
“Egad,”	25
said	25
Sancho,	25
“but	25
that	25
sort	25
of	25
life	25
squares,	25
nay	25
corners,	25
with	25
my	25
notions;	25
and	25
what	25
is	25
more	25
the	25
bachelor	25
Samson	25
Carrasco	25
and	25
Master	25
Nicholas	25
the	25
barber	25
won’t	25
have	25
well	25
seen	25
it	25
before	25
they’ll	25
want	25
to	25
follow	25
it	25
and	25
turn	25
shepherds	25
along	25
with	25
us;	25
and	25
God	25
grant	25
it	25
may	25
not	25
come	25
into	25
the	25
curate’s	25
head	25
to	25
join	25
the	25
sheepfold	25
too,	25
he’s	25
so	25
jovial	25
and	25
fond	25
of	25
enjoying	25
himself.”	25
“Thou	25
art	25
in	25
the	25
right	25
of	25
it,	25
Sancho,”	25
said	25
Don	25
Quixote;	25
“and	25
the	25
bachelor	25
Samson	25
Carrasco,	25
if	25
he	25
enters	25
the	25
pastoral	25
fraternity,	25
as	25
no	25
doubt	25
he	25
will,	25
may	25
call	25
himself	25
the	25
shepherd	25
Samsonino,	25
or	25
perhaps	25
the	25
shepherd	25
Carrascon;	25
Nicholas	25
the	25
barber	25
may	25
call	25
himself	25
Niculoso,	25
as	25
old	25
Boscan	25
formerly	25
was	25
called	25
Nemoroso;	25
as	25
for	25
the	25
curate	25
I	25
don’t	25
know	25
what	25
name	25
we	25
can	25
fit	25
to	25
him	25
unless	25
it	25
be	25
something	25
derived	25
from	25
his	25
title,	25
and	25
we	25
call	25
him	25
the	25
shepherd	25
Curiambro.	25
For	25
the	25
shepherdesses	25
whose	25
lovers	25
we	25
shall	25
be,	25
we	25
can	25
pick	25
names	25
as	25
we	25
would	25
pears;	25
and	25
as	25
my	25
lady’s	25
name	25
does	25
just	25
as	25
well	25
for	25
a	25
shepherdess’s	25
as	25
for	25
a	25
princess’s,	25
I	25
need	25
not	25
trouble	25
myself	25
to	25
look	25
for	25
one	25
that	25
will	25
suit	25
her	25
better;	25
to	25
thine,	25
Sancho,	25
thou	25
canst	25
give	25
what	25
name	25
thou	25
wilt.”	25
“I	25
don’t	25
mean	25
to	25
give	25
her	25
any	25
but	25
Teresona,”	25
said	25
Sancho,	25
“which	25
will	25
go	25
well	25
with	25
her	25
stoutness	25
and	25
with	25
her	25
own	25
right	25
name,	25
as	25
she	25
is	25
called	25
Teresa;	25
and	25
then	25
when	25
I	25
sing	25
her	25
praises	25
in	25
my	25
verses	25
I’ll	25
show	25
how	25
chaste	25
my	25
passion	25
is,	25
for	25
I’m	25
not	25
going	25
to	25
look	25
‘for	25
better	25
bread	25
than	25
ever	25
came	25
from	25
wheat’	25
in	25
other	25
men’s	25
houses.	25
It	25
won’t	25
do	25
for	25
the	25
curate	25
to	25
have	25
a	25
shepherdess,	25
for	25
the	25
sake	25
of	25
good	25
example;	25
and	25
if	25
the	25
bachelor	25
chooses	25
to	25
have	25
one,	25
that	25
is	25
his	25
look-out.”	25
“God	25
bless	25
me,	25
Sancho	25
my	25
friend!”	25
said	25
Don	25
Quixote,	25
“what	25
a	25
life	25
we	25
shall	25
lead!	25
What	25
hautboys	25
and	25
Zamora	25
bagpipes	25
we	25
shall	25
hear,	25
what	25
tabors,	25
timbrels,	25
and	25
rebecks!	25
And	25
then	25
if	25
among	25
all	25
these	25
different	25
sorts	25
of	25
music	25
that	25
of	25
the	25
albogues	25
is	25
heard,	25
almost	25
all	25
the	25
pastoral	25
instruments	25
will	25
be	25
there.”	25
“What	25
are	25
albogues?”	25
asked	25
Sancho,	25
“for	25
I	25
never	25
in	25
my	25
life	25
heard	25
tell	25
of	25
them	25
or	25
saw	25
them.”	25
“Albogues,”	25
said	25
Don	25
Quixote,	25
“are	25
brass	25
plates	25
like	25
candlesticks	25
that	25
struck	25
against	25
one	25
another	25
on	25
the	25
hollow	25
side	25
make	25
a	25
noise	25
which,	25
if	25
not	25
very	25
pleasing	25
or	25
harmonious,	25
is	25
not	25
disagreeable	25
and	25
accords	25
very	25
well	25
with	25
the	25
rude	25
notes	25
of	25
the	25
bagpipe	25
and	25
tabor.	25
The	25
word	25
albogue	25
is	25
Morisco,	25
as	25
are	25
all	25
those	25
in	25
our	25
Spanish	25
tongue	25
that	25
begin	25
with	25
_al;_	25
for	25
example,	25
_almohaza,	25
almorzar,	25
alhombra,	25
alguacil,	25
alhucema,	25
almacen,	25
alcancia_,	25
and	25
others	25
of	25
the	25
same	25
sort,	25
of	25
which	25
there	25
are	25
not	25
many	25
more;	25
our	25
language	25
has	25
only	25
three	25
that	25
are	25
Morisco	25
and	25
end	25
in	25
_i_,	25
which	25
are	25
_borceguí,	25
zaquizamí_,	25
and	25
_maravedí.	25
Alhelí_	25
and	25
_alfaquí_	25
are	25
seen	25
to	25
be	25
Arabic,	25
as	25
well	25
by	25
the	25
_al_	25
at	25
the	25
beginning	25
as	25
by	25
the	25
_í_	25
they	25
end	25
with.	25
I	25
mention	25
this	25
incidentally,	25
the	25
chance	25
allusion	25
to	25
albogues	25
having	25
reminded	25
me	25
of	25
it;	25
and	25
it	25
will	25
be	25
of	25
great	25
assistance	25
to	25
us	25
in	25
the	25
perfect	25
practice	25
of	25
this	25
calling	25
that	25
I	25
am	25
something	25
of	25
a	25
poet,	25
as	25
thou	25
knowest,	25
and	25
that	25
besides	25
the	25
bachelor	25
Samson	25
Carrasco	25
is	25
an	25
accomplished	25
one.	25
Of	25
the	25
curate	25
I	25
say	25
nothing;	25
but	25
I	25
will	25
wager	25
he	25
has	25
some	25
spice	25
of	25
the	25
poet	25
in	25
him,	25
and	25
no	25
doubt	25
Master	25
Nicholas	25
too,	25
for	25
all	25
barbers,	25
or	25
most	25
of	25
them,	25
are	25
guitar	25
players	25
and	25
stringers	25
of	25
verses.	25
I	25
will	25
bewail	25
my	25
separation;	25
thou	25
shalt	25
glorify	25
thyself	25
as	25
a	25
constant	25
lover;	25
the	25
shepherd	25
Carrascon	25
will	25
figure	25
as	25
a	25
rejected	25
one,	25
and	25
the	25
curate	25
Curiambro	25
as	25
whatever	25
may	25
please	25
him	25
best;	25
and	25
so	25
all	25
will	25
go	25
as	25
gaily	25
as	25
heart	25
could	25
wish.”	25
To	25
this	25
Sancho	25
made	25
answer,	25
“I	25
am	25
so	25
unlucky,	25
señor,	25
that	25
I’m	25
afraid	25
the	25
day	25
will	25
never	25
come	25
when	25
I’ll	25
see	25
myself	25
at	25
such	25
a	25
calling.	25
O	25
what	25
neat	25
spoons	25
I’ll	25
make	25
when	25
I’m	25
a	25
shepherd!	25
What	25
messes,	25
creams,	25
garlands,	25
pastoral	25
odds	25
and	25
ends!	25
And	25
if	25
they	25
don’t	25
get	25
me	25
a	25
name	25
for	25
wisdom,	25
they’ll	25
not	25
fail	25
to	25
get	25
me	25
one	25
for	25
ingenuity.	25
My	25
daughter	25
Sanchica	25
will	25
bring	25
us	25
our	25
dinner	25
to	25
the	25
pasture.	25
But	25
stay—she’s	25
good-looking,	25
and	25
shepherds	25
there	25
are	25
with	25
more	25
mischief	25
than	25
simplicity	25
in	25
them;	25
I	25
would	25
not	25
have	25
her	25
‘come	25
for	25
wool	25
and	25
go	25
back	25
shorn;’	25
love-making	25
and	25
lawless	25
desires	25
are	25
just	25
as	25
common	25
in	25
the	25
fields	25
as	25
in	25
the	25
cities,	25
and	25
in	25
shepherds’	25
shanties	25
as	25
in	25
royal	25
palaces;	25
‘do	25
away	25
with	25
the	25
cause,	25
you	25
do	25
away	25
with	25
the	25
sin;’	25
‘if	25
eyes	25
don’t	25
see	25
hearts	25
don’t	25
break’	25
and	25
‘better	25
a	25
clear	25
escape	25
than	25
good	25
men’s	25
prayers.’”	25
“A	25
truce	25
to	25
thy	25
proverbs,	25
Sancho,”	25
exclaimed	25
Don	25
Quixote;	25
“any	25
one	25
of	25
those	25
thou	25
hast	25
uttered	25
would	25
suffice	25
to	25
explain	25
thy	25
meaning;	25
many	25
a	25
time	25
have	25
I	25
recommended	25
thee	25
not	25
to	25
be	25
so	25
lavish	25
with	25
proverbs	25
and	25
to	25
exercise	25
some	25
moderation	25
in	25
delivering	25
them;	25
but	25
it	25
seems	25
to	25
me	25
it	25
is	25
only	25
‘preaching	25
in	25
the	25
desert;’	25
‘my	25
mother	25
beats	25
me	25
and	25
I	25
go	25
on	25
with	25
my	25
tricks.”	25
“It	25
seems	25
to	25
me,”	25
said	25
Sancho,	25
“that	25
your	25
worship	25
is	25
like	25
the	25
common	25
saying,	25
‘Said	25
the	25
frying-pan	25
to	25
the	25
kettle,	25
Get	25
away,	25
blackbreech.’	25
You	25
chide	25
me	25
for	25
uttering	25
proverbs,	25
and	25
you	25
string	25
them	25
in	25
couples	25
yourself.”	25
“Observe,	25
Sancho,”	25
replied	25
Don	25
Quixote,	25
“I	25
bring	25
in	25
proverbs	25
to	25
the	25
purpose,	25
and	25
when	25
I	25
quote	25
them	25
they	25
fit	25
like	25
a	25
ring	25
to	25
the	25
finger;	25
thou	25
bringest	25
them	25
in	25
by	25
the	25
head	25
and	25
shoulders,	25
in	25
such	25
a	25
way	25
that	25
thou	25
dost	25
drag	25
them	25
in,	25
rather	25
than	25
introduce	25
them;	25
if	25
I	25
am	25
not	25
mistaken,	25
I	25
have	25
told	25
thee	25
already	25
that	25
proverbs	25
are	25
short	25
maxims	25
drawn	25
from	25
the	25
experience	25
and	25
observation	25
of	25
our	25
wise	25
men	25
of	25
old;	25
but	25
the	25
proverb	25
that	25
is	25
not	25
to	25
the	25
purpose	25
is	25
a	25
piece	25
of	25
nonsense	25
and	25
not	25
a	25
maxim.	25
But	25
enough	25
of	25
this;	25
as	25
nightfall	25
is	25
drawing	25
on	25
let	25
us	25
retire	25
some	25
little	25
distance	25
from	25
the	25
high	25
road	25
to	25
pass	25
the	25
night;	25
what	25
is	25
in	25
store	25
for	25
us	25
to-morrow	25
God	25
knoweth.”	25
They	25
turned	25
aside,	25
and	25
supped	25
late	25
and	25
poorly,	25
very	25
much	25
against	25
Sancho’s	25
will,	25
who	25
turned	25
over	25
in	25
his	25
mind	25
the	25
hardships	25
attendant	25
upon	25
knight-errantry	25
in	25
woods	25
and	25
forests,	25
even	25
though	25
at	25
times	25
plenty	25
presented	25
itself	25
in	25
castles	25
and	25
houses,	25
as	25
at	25
Don	25
Diego	25
de	25
Miranda’s,	25
at	25
the	25
wedding	25
of	25
Camacho	25
the	25
Rich,	25
and	25
at	25
Don	25
Antonio	25
Moreno’s;	25
he	25
reflected,	25
however,	25
that	25
it	25
could	25
not	25
be	25
always	25
day,	25
nor	25
always	25
night;	25
and	25
so	25
that	25
night	25
he	25
passed	25
in	25
sleeping,	25
and	25
his	25
master	25
in	25
waking.	25

The	25
night	25
was	25
somewhat	25
dark,	25
for	25
though	25
there	25
was	25
a	25
moon	25
in	25
the	25
sky	25
it	25
was	25
not	25
in	25
a	25
quarter	25
where	25
she	25
could	25
be	25
seen;	25
for	25
sometimes	25
the	25
lady	25
Diana	25
goes	25
on	25
a	25
stroll	25
to	25
the	25
antipodes,	25
and	25
leaves	25
the	25
mountains	25
all	25
black	25
and	25
the	25
valleys	25
in	25
darkness.	25
Don	25
Quixote	25
obeyed	25
nature	25
so	25
far	25
as	25
to	25
sleep	25
his	25
first	25
sleep,	25
but	25
did	25
not	25
give	25
way	25
to	25
the	25
second,	25
very	25
different	25
from	25
Sancho,	25
who	25
never	25
had	25
any	25
second,	25
because	25
with	25
him	25
sleep	25
lasted	25
from	25
night	25
till	25
morning,	25
wherein	25
he	25
showed	25
what	25
a	25
sound	25
constitution	25
and	25
few	25
cares	25
he	25
had.	25
Don	25
Quixote’s	25
cares	25
kept	25
him	25
restless,	25
so	25
much	25
so	25
that	25
he	25
awoke	25
Sancho	25
and	25
said	25
to	25
him,	25
“I	25
am	25
amazed,	25
Sancho,	25
at	25
the	25
unconcern	25
of	25
thy	25
temperament.	25
I	25
believe	25
thou	25
art	25
made	25
of	25
marble	25
or	25
hard	25
brass,	25
incapable	25
of	25
any	25
emotion	25
or	25
feeling	25
whatever.	25
I	25
lie	25
awake	25
while	25
thou	25
sleepest,	25
I	25
weep	25
while	25
thou	25
singest,	25
I	25
am	25
faint	25
with	25
fasting	25
while	25
thou	25
art	25
sluggish	25
and	25
torpid	25
from	25
pure	25
repletion.	25
It	25
is	25
the	25
duty	25
of	25
good	25
servants	25
to	25
share	25
the	25
sufferings	25
and	25
feel	25
the	25
sorrows	25
of	25
their	25
masters,	25
if	25
it	25
be	25
only	25
for	25
the	25
sake	25
of	25
appearances.	25
See	25
the	25
calmness	25
of	25
the	25
night,	25
the	25
solitude	25
of	25
the	25
spot,	25
inviting	25
us	25
to	25
break	25
our	25
slumbers	25
by	25
a	25
vigil	25
of	25
some	25
sort.	25
Rise	25
as	25
thou	25
livest,	25
and	25
retire	25
a	25
little	25
distance,	25
and	25
with	25
a	25
good	25
heart	25
and	25
cheerful	25
courage	25
give	25
thyself	25
three	25
or	25
four	25
hundred	25
lashes	25
on	25
account	25
of	25
Dulcinea’s	25
disenchantment	25
score;	25
and	25
this	25
I	25
entreat	25
of	25
thee,	25
making	25
it	25
a	25
request,	25
for	25
I	25
have	25
no	25
desire	25
to	25
come	25
to	25
grips	25
with	25
thee	25
a	25
second	25
time,	25
as	25
I	25
know	25
thou	25
hast	25
a	25
heavy	25
hand.	25
As	25
soon	25
as	25
thou	25
hast	25
laid	25
them	25
on	25
we	25
will	25
pass	25
the	25
rest	25
of	25
the	25
night,	25
I	25
singing	25
my	25
separation,	25
thou	25
thy	25
constancy,	25
making	25
a	25
beginning	25
at	25
once	25
with	25
the	25
pastoral	25
life	25
we	25
are	25
to	25
follow	25
at	25
our	25
village.”	25
“Señor,”	25
replied	25
Sancho,	25
“I’m	25
no	25
monk	25
to	25
get	25
up	25
out	25
of	25
the	25
middle	25
of	25
my	25
sleep	25
and	25
scourge	25
myself,	25
nor	25
does	25
it	25
seem	25
to	25
me	25
that	25
one	25
can	25
pass	25
from	25
one	25
extreme	25
of	25
the	25
pain	25
of	25
whipping	25
to	25
the	25
other	25
of	25
music.	25
Will	25
your	25
worship	25
let	25
me	25
sleep,	25
and	25
not	25
worry	25
me	25
about	25
whipping	25
myself?	25
or	25
you’ll	25
make	25
me	25
swear	25
never	25
to	25
touch	25
a	25
hair	25
of	25
my	25
doublet,	25
not	25
to	25
say	25
my	25
flesh.”	25
“O	25
hard	25
heart!”	25
said	25
Don	25
Quixote,	25
“O	25
pitiless	25
squire!	25
O	25
bread	25
ill-bestowed	25
and	25
favours	25
ill-acknowledged,	25
both	25
those	25
I	25
have	25
done	25
thee	25
and	25
those	25
I	25
mean	25
to	25
do	25
thee!	25
Through	25
me	25
hast	25
thou	25
seen	25
thyself	25
a	25
governor,	25
and	25
through	25
me	25
thou	25
seest	25
thyself	25
in	25
immediate	25
expectation	25
of	25
being	25
a	25
count,	25
or	25
obtaining	25
some	25
other	25
equivalent	25
title,	25
for	25
I—_post	25
tenebras	25
spero	25
lucem_.”	25
“I	25
don’t	25
know	25
what	25
that	25
is,”	25
said	25
Sancho;	25
“all	25
I	25
know	25
is	25
that	25
so	25
long	25
as	25
I	25
am	25
asleep	25
I	25
have	25
neither	25
fear	25
nor	25
hope,	25
trouble	25
nor	25
glory;	25
and	25
good	25
luck	25
betide	25
him	25
that	25
invented	25
sleep,	25
the	25
cloak	25
that	25
covers	25
over	25
all	25
a	25
man’s	25
thoughts,	25
the	25
food	25
that	25
removes	25
hunger,	25
the	25
drink	25
that	25
drives	25
away	25
thirst,	25
the	25
fire	25
that	25
warms	25
the	25
cold,	25
the	25
cold	25
that	25
tempers	25
the	25
heat,	25
and,	25
to	25
wind	25
up	25
with,	25
the	25
universal	25
coin	25
wherewith	25
everything	25
is	25
bought,	25
the	25
weight	25
and	25
balance	25
that	25
makes	25
the	25
shepherd	25
equal	25
with	25
the	25
king	25
and	25
the	25
fool	25
with	25
the	25
wise	25
man.	25
Sleep,	25
I	25
have	25
heard	25
say,	25
has	25
only	25
one	25
fault,	25
that	25
it	25
is	25
like	25
death;	25
for	25
between	25
a	25
sleeping	25
man	25
and	25
a	25
dead	25
man	25
there	25
is	25
very	25
little	25
difference.”	25
“Never	25
have	25
I	25
heard	25
thee	25
speak	25
so	25
elegantly	25
as	25
now,	25
Sancho,”	25
said	25
Don	25
Quixote;	25
“and	25
here	25
I	25
begin	25
to	25
see	25
the	25
truth	25
of	25
the	25
proverb	25
thou	25
dost	25
sometimes	25
quote,	25
‘Not	25
with	25
whom	25
thou	25
art	25
bred,	25
but	25
with	25
whom	25
thou	25
art	25
fed.’”	25
“Ha,	25
by	25
my	25
life,	25
master	25
mine,”	25
said	25
Sancho,	25
“it’s	25
not	25
I	25
that	25
am	25
stringing	25
proverbs	25
now,	25
for	25
they	25
drop	25
in	25
pairs	25
from	25
your	25
worship’s	25
mouth	25
faster	25
than	25
from	25
mine;	25
only	25
there	25
is	25
this	25
difference	25
between	25
mine	25
and	25
yours,	25
that	25
yours	25
are	25
well-timed	25
and	25
mine	25
are	25
untimely;	25
but	25
anyhow,	25
they	25
are	25
all	25
proverbs.”	25
At	25
this	25
point	25
they	25
became	25
aware	25
of	25
a	25
harsh	25
indistinct	25
noise	25
that	25
seemed	25
to	25
spread	25
through	25
all	25
the	25
valleys	25
around.	25
Don	25
Quixote	25
stood	25
up	25
and	25
laid	25
his	25
hand	25
upon	25
his	25
sword,	25
and	25
Sancho	25
ensconced	25
himself	25
under	25
Dapple	25
and	25
put	25
the	25
bundle	25
of	25
armour	25
on	25
one	25
side	25
of	25
him	25
and	25
the	25
ass’s	25
pack-saddle	25
on	25
the	25
other,	25
in	25
fear	25
and	25
trembling	25
as	25
great	25
as	25
Don	25
Quixote’s	25
perturbation.	25
Each	25
instant	25
the	25
noise	25
increased	25
and	25
came	25
nearer	25
to	25
the	25
two	25
terrified	25
men,	25
or	25
at	25
least	25
to	25
one,	25
for	25
as	25
to	25
the	25
other,	25
his	25
courage	25
is	25
known	25
to	25
all.	25
The	25
fact	25
of	25
the	25
matter	25
was	25
that	25
some	25
men	25
were	25
taking	25
above	25
six	25
hundred	25
pigs	25
to	25
sell	25
at	25
a	25
fair,	25
and	25
were	25
on	25
their	25
way	25
with	25
them	25
at	25
that	25
hour,	25
and	25
so	25
great	25
was	25
the	25
noise	25
they	25
made	25
and	25
their	25
grunting	25
and	25
blowing,	25
that	25
they	25
deafened	25
the	25
ears	25
of	25
Don	25
Quixote	25
and	25
Sancho	25
Panza,	25
and	25
they	25
could	25
not	25
make	25
out	25
what	25
it	25
was.	25
The	25
wide-spread	25
grunting	25
drove	25
came	25
on	25
in	25
a	25
surging	25
mass,	25
and	25
without	25
showing	25
any	25
respect	25
for	25
Don	25
Quixote’s	25
dignity	25
or	25
Sancho’s,	25
passed	25
right	25
over	25
the	25
pair	25
of	25
them,	25
demolishing	25
Sancho’s	25
entrenchments,	25
and	25
not	25
only	25
upsetting	25
Don	25
Quixote	25
but	25
sweeping	25
Rocinante	25
off	25
his	25
feet	25
into	25
the	25
bargain;	25
and	25
what	25
with	25
the	25
trampling	25
and	25
the	25
grunting,	25
and	25
the	25
pace	25
at	25
which	25
the	25
unclean	25
beasts	25
went,	25
pack-saddle,	25
armour,	25
Dapple	25
and	25
Rocinante	25
were	25
left	25
scattered	25
on	25
the	25
ground	25
and	25
Sancho	25
and	25
Don	25
Quixote	25
at	25
their	25
wits’	25
end.	25
Sancho	25
got	25
up	25
as	25
well	25
as	25
he	25
could	25
and	25
begged	25
his	25
master	25
to	25
give	25
him	25
his	25
sword,	25
saying	25
he	25
wanted	25
to	25
kill	25
half	25
a	25
dozen	25
of	25
those	25
dirty	25
unmannerly	25
pigs,	25
for	25
he	25
had	25
by	25
this	25
time	25
found	25
out	25
that	26
was	26
what	26
they	26
were.	26
“Let	26
them	26
be,	26
my	26
friend,”	26
said	26
Don	26
Quixote;	26
“this	26
insult	26
is	26
the	26
penalty	26
of	26
my	26
sin;	26
and	26
it	26
is	26
the	26
righteous	26
chastisement	26
of	26
heaven	26
that	26
jackals	26
should	26
devour	26
a	26
vanquished	26
knight,	26
and	26
wasps	26
sting	26
him	26
and	26
pigs	26
trample	26
him	26
under	26
foot.”	26
“I	26
suppose	26
it	26
is	26
the	26
chastisement	26
of	26
heaven,	26
too,”	26
said	26
Sancho,	26
“that	26
flies	26
should	26
prick	26
the	26
squires	26
of	26
vanquished	26
knights,	26
and	26
lice	26
eat	26
them,	26
and	26
hunger	26
assail	26
them.	26
If	26
we	26
squires	26
were	26
the	26
sons	26
of	26
the	26
knights	26
we	26
serve,	26
or	26
their	26
very	26
near	26
relations,	26
it	26
would	26
be	26
no	26
wonder	26
if	26
the	26
penalty	26
of	26
their	26
misdeeds	26
overtook	26
us,	26
even	26
to	26
the	26
fourth	26
generation.	26
But	26
what	26
have	26
the	26
Panzas	26
to	26
do	26
with	26
the	26
Quixotes?	26
Well,	26
well,	26
let’s	26
lie	26
down	26
again	26
and	26
sleep	26
out	26
what	26
little	26
of	26
the	26
night	26
there’s	26
left,	26
and	26
God	26
will	26
send	26
us	26
dawn	26
and	26
we	26
shall	26
be	26
all	26
right.”	26

“Sleep	26
thou,	26
Sancho,”	26
returned	26
Don	26
Quixote,	26
“for	26
thou	26
wast	26
born	26
to	26
sleep	26
as	26
I	26
was	26
born	26
to	26
watch;	26
and	26
during	26
the	26
time	26
it	26
now	26
wants	26
of	26
dawn	26
I	26
will	26
give	26
a	26
loose	26
rein	26
to	26
my	26
thoughts,	26
and	26
seek	26
a	26
vent	26
for	26
them	26
in	26
a	26
little	26
madrigal	26
which,	26
unknown	26
to	26
thee,	26
I	26
composed	26
in	26
my	26
head	26
last	26
night.”	26
“I	26
should	26
think,”	26
said	26
Sancho,	26
“that	26
the	26
thoughts	26
that	26
allow	26
one	26
to	26
make	26
verses	26
cannot	26
be	26
of	26
great	26
consequence;	26
let	26
your	26
worship	26
string	26
verses	26
as	26
much	26
as	26
you	26
like	26
and	26
I’ll	26
sleep	26
as	26
much	26
as	26
I	26
can;”	26
and	26
forthwith,	26
taking	26
the	26
space	26
of	26
ground	26
he	26
required,	26
he	26
muffled	26
himself	26
up	26
and	26
fell	26
into	26
a	26
sound	26
sleep,	26
undisturbed	26
by	26
bond,	26
debt,	26
or	26
trouble	26
of	26
any	26
sort.	26
Don	26
Quixote,	26
propped	26
up	26
against	26
the	26
trunk	26
of	26
a	26
beech	26
or	26
a	26
cork	26
tree—for	26
Cide	26
Hamete	26
does	26
not	26
specify	26
what	26
kind	26
of	26
tree	26
it	26
was—sang	26
in	26
this	26
strain	26
to	26
the	26
accompaniment	26
of	26
his	26
own	26
sighs:	26
When	26
in	26
my	26
mind	26
I	26
muse,	26
O	26
Love,	26
upon	26
thy	26
cruelty,	26
To	26
death	26
I	26
flee,	26
In	26
hope	26
therein	26
the	26
end	26
of	26
all	26
to	26
find.	26
But	26
drawing	26
near	26
That	26
welcome	26
haven	26
in	26
my	26
sea	26
of	26
woe,	26
Such	26
joy	26
I	26
know,	26
That	26
life	26
revives,	26
and	26
still	26
I	26
linger	26
here.	26
Thus	26
life	26
doth	26
slay,	26
And	26
death	26
again	26
to	26
life	26
restoreth	26
me;	26
Strange	26
destiny,	26
That	26
deals	26
with	26
life	26
and	26
death	26
as	26
with	26
a	26
play!	26
He	26
accompanied	26
each	26
verse	26
with	26
many	26
sighs	26
and	26
not	26
a	26
few	26
tears,	26
just	26
like	26
one	26
whose	26
heart	26
was	26
pierced	26
with	26
grief	26
at	26
his	26
defeat	26
and	26
his	26
separation	26
from	26
Dulcinea.	26
And	26
now	26
daylight	26
came,	26
and	26
the	26
sun	26
smote	26
Sancho	26
on	26
the	26
eyes	26
with	26
his	26
beams.	26
He	26
awoke,	26
roused	26
himself	26
up,	26
shook	26
himself	26
and	26
stretched	26
his	26
lazy	26
limbs,	26
and	26
seeing	26
the	26
havoc	26
the	26
pigs	26
had	26
made	26
with	26
his	26
stores	26
he	26
cursed	26
the	26
drove,	26
and	26
more	26
besides.	26
Then	26
the	26
pair	26
resumed	26
their	26
journey,	26
and	26
as	26
evening	26
closed	26
in	26
they	26
saw	26
coming	26
towards	26
them	26
some	26
ten	26
men	26
on	26
horseback	26
and	26
four	26
or	26
five	26
on	26
foot.	26
Don	26
Quixote’s	26
heart	26
beat	26
quick	26
and	26
Sancho’s	26
quailed	26
with	26
fear,	26
for	26
the	26
persons	26
approaching	26
them	26
carried	26
lances	26
and	26
bucklers,	26
and	26
were	26
in	26
very	26
warlike	26
guise.	26
Don	26
Quixote	26
turned	26
to	26
Sancho	26
and	26
said,	26
“If	26
I	26
could	26
make	26
use	26
of	26
my	26
weapons,	26
and	26
my	26
promise	26
had	26
not	26
tied	26
my	26
hands,	26
I	26
would	26
count	26
this	26
host	26
that	26
comes	26
against	26
us	26
but	26
cakes	26
and	26
fancy	26
bread;	26
but	26
perhaps	26
it	26
may	26
prove	26
something	26
different	26
from	26
what	26
we	26
apprehend.”	26
The	26
men	26
on	26
horseback	26
now	26
came	26
up,	26
and	26
raising	26
their	26
lances	26
surrounded	26
Don	26
Quixote	26
in	26
silence,	26
and	26
pointed	26
them	26
at	26
his	26
back	26
and	26
breast,	26
menacing	26
him	26
with	26
death.	26
One	26
of	26
those	26
on	26
foot,	26
putting	26
his	26
finger	26
to	26
his	26
lips	26
as	26
a	26
sign	26
to	26
him	26
to	26
be	26
silent,	26
seized	26
Rocinante’s	26
bridle	26
and	26
drew	26
him	26
out	26
of	26
the	26
road,	26
and	26
the	26
others	26
driving	26
Sancho	26
and	26
Dapple	26
before	26
them,	26
and	26
all	26
maintaining	26
a	26
strange	26
silence,	26
followed	26
in	26
the	26
steps	26
of	26
the	26
one	26
who	26
led	26
Don	26
Quixote.	26
The	26
latter	26
two	26
or	26
three	26
times	26
attempted	26
to	26
ask	26
where	26
they	26
were	26
taking	26
him	26
to	26
and	26
what	26
they	26
wanted,	26
but	26
the	26
instant	26
he	26
began	26
to	26
open	26
his	26
lips	26
they	26
threatened	26
to	26
close	26
them	26
with	26
the	26
points	26
of	26
their	26
lances;	26
and	26
Sancho	26
fared	26
the	26
same	26
way,	26
for	26
the	26
moment	26
he	26
seemed	26
about	26
to	26
speak	26
one	26
of	26
those	26
on	26
foot	26
punched	26
him	26
with	26
a	26
goad,	26
and	26
Dapple	26
likewise,	26
as	26
if	26
he	26
too	26
wanted	26
to	26
talk.	26
Night	26
set	26
in,	26
they	26
quickened	26
their	26
pace,	26
and	26
the	26
fears	26
of	26
the	26
two	26
prisoners	26
grew	26
greater,	26
especially	26
as	26
they	26
heard	26
themselves	26
assailed	26
with—“Get	26
on,	26
ye	26
Troglodytes;”	26
“Silence,	26
ye	26
barbarians;”	26
“March,	26
ye	26
cannibals;”	26
“No	26
murmuring,	26
ye	26
Scythians;”	26
“Don’t	26
open	26
your	26
eyes,	26
ye	26
murderous	26
Polyphemes,	26
ye	26
blood-thirsty	26
lions,”	26
and	26
suchlike	26
names	26
with	26
which	26
their	26
captors	26
harassed	26
the	26
ears	26
of	26
the	26
wretched	26
master	26
and	26
man.	26
Sancho	26
went	26
along	26
saying	26
to	26
himself,	26
“We,	26
tortolites,	26
barbers,	26
animals!	26
I	26
don’t	26
like	26
those	26
names	26
at	26
all;	26
‘it’s	26
in	26
a	26
bad	26
wind	26
our	26
corn	26
is	26
being	26
winnowed;’	26
‘misfortune	26
comes	26
upon	26
us	26
all	26
at	26
once	26
like	26
sticks	26
on	26
a	26
dog,’	26
and	26
God	26
grant	26
it	26
may	26
be	26
no	26
worse	26
than	26
them	26
that	26
this	26
unlucky	26
adventure	26
has	26
in	26
store	26
for	26
us.”	26
Don	26
Quixote	26
rode	26
completely	26
dazed,	26
unable	26
with	26
the	26
aid	26
of	26
all	26
his	26
wits	26
to	26
make	26
out	26
what	26
could	26
be	26
the	26
meaning	26
of	26
these	26
abusive	26
names	26
they	26
called	26
them,	26
and	26
the	26
only	26
conclusion	26
he	26
could	26
arrive	26
at	26
was	26
that	26
there	26
was	26
no	26
good	26
to	26
be	26
hoped	26
for	26
and	26
much	26
evil	26
to	26
be	26
feared.	26
And	26
now,	26
about	26
an	26
hour	26
after	26
midnight,	26
they	26
reached	26
a	26
castle	26
which	26
Don	26
Quixote	26
saw	26
at	26
once	26
was	26
the	26
duke’s,	26
where	26
they	26
had	26
been	26
but	26
a	26
short	26
time	26
before.	26
“God	26
bless	26
me!”	26
said	26
he,	26
as	26
he	26
recognised	26
the	26
mansion,	26
“what	26
does	26
this	26
mean?	26
It	26
is	26
all	26
courtesy	26
and	26
politeness	26
in	26
this	26
house;	26
but	26
with	26
the	26
vanquished	26
good	26
turns	26
into	26
evil,	26
and	26
evil	26
into	26
worse.”	26
They	26
entered	26
the	26
chief	26
court	26
of	26
the	26
castle	26
and	26
found	26
it	26
prepared	26
and	26
fitted	26
up	26
in	26
a	26
style	26
that	26
added	26
to	26
their	26
amazement	26
and	26
doubled	26
their	26
fears,	26
as	26
will	26
be	26
seen	26
in	26
the	26
following	26
chapter.	26

The	26
horsemen	26
dismounted,	26
and,	26
together	26
with	26
the	26
men	26
on	26
foot,	26
without	26
a	26
moment’s	26
delay	26
taking	26
up	26
Sancho	26
and	26
Don	26
Quixote	26
bodily,	26
they	26
carried	26
them	26
into	26
the	26
court,	26
all	26
round	26
which	26
near	26
a	26
hundred	26
torches	26
fixed	26
in	26
sockets	26
were	26
burning,	26
besides	26
above	26
five	26
hundred	26
lamps	26
in	26
the	26
corridors,	26
so	26
that	26
in	26
spite	26
of	26
the	26
night,	26
which	26
was	26
somewhat	26
dark,	26
the	26
want	26
of	26
daylight	26
could	26
not	26
be	26
perceived.	26
In	26
the	26
middle	26
of	26
the	26
court	26
was	26
a	26
catafalque,	26
raised	26
about	26
two	26
yards	26
above	26
the	26
ground	26
and	26
covered	26
completely	26
by	26
an	26
immense	26
canopy	26
of	26
black	26
velvet,	26
and	26
on	26
the	26
steps	26
all	26
round	26
it	26
white	26
wax	26
tapers	26
burned	26
in	26
more	26
than	26
a	26
hundred	26
silver	26
candlesticks.	26
Upon	26
the	26
catafalque	26
was	26
seen	26
the	26
dead	26
body	26
of	26
a	26
damsel	26
so	26
lovely	26
that	26
by	26
her	26
beauty	26
she	26
made	26
death	26
itself	26
look	26
beautiful.	26
She	26
lay	26
with	26
her	26
head	26
resting	26
upon	26
a	26
cushion	26
of	26
brocade	26
and	26
crowned	26
with	26
a	26
garland	26
of	26
sweet-smelling	26
flowers	26
of	26
divers	26
sorts,	26
her	26
hands	26
crossed	26
upon	26
her	26
bosom,	26
and	26
between	26
them	26
a	26
branch	26
of	26
yellow	26
palm	26
of	26
victory.	26
On	26
one	26
side	26
of	26
the	26
court	26
was	26
erected	26
a	26
stage,	26
where	26
upon	26
two	26
chairs	26
were	26
seated	26
two	26
persons	26
who	26
from	26
having	26
crowns	26
on	26
their	26
heads	26
and	26
sceptres	26
in	26
their	26
hands	26
appeared	26
to	26
be	26
kings	26
of	26
some	26
sort,	26
whether	26
real	26
or	26
mock	26
ones.	26
By	26
the	26
side	26
of	26
this	26
stage,	26
which	26
was	26
reached	26
by	26
steps,	26
were	26
two	26
other	26
chairs	26
on	26
which	26
the	26
men	26
carrying	26
the	26
prisoners	26
seated	26
Don	26
Quixote	26
and	26
Sancho,	26
all	26
in	26
silence,	26
and	26
by	26
signs	26
giving	26
them	26
to	26
understand	26
that	26
they	26
too	26
were	26
to	26
be	26
silent;	26
which,	26
however,	26
they	26
would	26
have	26
been	26
without	26
any	26
signs,	26
for	26
their	26
amazement	26
at	26
all	26
they	26
saw	26
held	26
them	26
tongue-tied.	26
And	26
now	26
two	26
persons	26
of	26
distinction,	26
who	26
were	26
at	26
once	26
recognised	26
by	26
Don	26
Quixote	26
as	26
his	26
hosts	26
the	26
duke	26
and	26
duchess,	26
ascended	26
the	26
stage	26
attended	26
by	26
a	26
numerous	26
suite,	26
and	26
seated	26
themselves	26
on	26
two	26
gorgeous	26
chairs	26
close	26
to	26
the	26
two	26
kings,	26
as	26
they	26
seemed	26
to	26
be.	26
Who	26
would	26
not	26
have	26
been	26
amazed	26
at	26
this?	26
Nor	26
was	26
this	26
all,	26
for	26
Don	26
Quixote	26
had	26
perceived	26
that	26
the	26
dead	26
body	26
on	26
the	26
catafalque	26
was	26
that	26
of	26
the	26
fair	26
Altisidora.	26
As	26
the	26
duke	26
and	26
duchess	26
mounted	26
the	26
stage	26
Don	26
Quixote	26
and	26
Sancho	26
rose	26
and	26
made	26
them	26
a	26
profound	26
obeisance,	26
which	26
they	26
returned	26
by	26
bowing	26
their	26
heads	26
slightly.	26
At	26
this	26
moment	26
an	26
official	26
crossed	26
over,	26
and	26
approaching	26
Sancho	26
threw	26
over	26
him	26
a	26
robe	26
of	26
black	26
buckram	26
painted	26
all	26
over	26
with	26
flames	26
of	26
fire,	26
and	26
taking	26
off	26
his	26
cap	26
put	26
upon	26
his	26
head	26
a	26
mitre	26
such	26
as	26
those	26
undergoing	26
the	26
sentence	26
of	26
the	26
Holy	26
Office	26
wear;	26
and	26
whispered	26
in	26
his	26
ear	26
that	26
he	26
must	26
not	26
open	26
his	26
lips,	26
or	26
they	26
would	26
put	26
a	26
gag	26
upon	26
him,	26
or	26
take	26
his	26
life.	26
Sancho	26
surveyed	26
himself	26
from	26
head	26
to	26
foot	26
and	26
saw	26
himself	26
all	26
ablaze	26
with	26
flames;	26
but	26
as	26
they	26
did	26
not	26
burn	26
him,	26
he	26
did	26
not	26
care	26
two	26
farthings	26
for	26
them.	26
He	26
took	26
off	26
the	26
mitre	26
and	26
seeing	26
it	26
painted	26
with	26
devils	26
he	26
put	26
it	26
on	26
again,	26
saying	26
to	26
himself,	26
“Well,	26
so	26
far	26
those	26
don’t	26
burn	26
me	26
nor	26
do	26
these	26
carry	26
me	26
off.”	26
Don	26
Quixote	26
surveyed	26
him	26
too,	26
and	26
though	26
fear	26
had	26
got	26
the	26
better	26
of	26
his	26
faculties,	26
he	26
could	26
not	26
help	26
smiling	26
to	26
see	26
the	26
figure	26
Sancho	26
presented.	26
And	26
now	26
from	26
underneath	26
the	26
catafalque,	26
so	26
it	26
seemed,	26
there	26
rose	26
a	26
low	26
sweet	26
sound	26
of	26
flutes,	26
which,	26
coming	26
unbroken	26
by	26
human	26
voice	26
(for	26
there	26
silence	26
itself	26
kept	26
silence),	26
had	26
a	26
soft	26
and	26
languishing	26
effect.	26
Then,	26
beside	26
the	26
pillow	26
of	26
what	26
seemed	26
to	26
be	26
the	26
dead	26
body,	26
suddenly	26
appeared	26
a	26
fair	26
youth	26
in	26
a	26
Roman	26
habit,	26
who,	26
to	26
the	26
accompaniment	26
of	26
a	26
harp	26
which	26
he	26
himself	26
played,	26
sang	26
in	26
a	26
sweet	26
and	26
clear	26
voice	26
these	26
two	26
stanzas:	26
While	26
fair	26
Altisidora,	26
who	26
the	26
sport	26
Of	26
cold	26
Don	26
Quixote’s	26
cruelty	26
hath	26
been,	26
Returns	26
to	26
life,	26
and	26
in	26
this	26
magic	26
court	26
The	26
dames	26
in	26
sables	26
come	26
to	26
grace	26
the	26
scene,	26
And	26
while	26
her	26
matrons	26
all	26
in	26
seemly	26
sort	26
My	26
lady	26
robes	26
in	26
baize	26
and	26
bombazine,	26
Her	26
beauty	26
and	26
her	26
sorrows	26
will	26
I	26
sing	26
With	26
defter	26
quill	26
than	26
touched	26
the	26
Thracian	26
string.	26
But	26
not	26
in	26
life	26
alone,	26
methinks,	26
to	26
me	26
Belongs	26
the	26
office;	26
Lady,	26
when	26
my	26
tongue	26
Is	26
cold	26
in	26
death,	26
believe	26
me,	26
unto	26
thee	26
My	26
voice	26
shall	26
raise	26
its	26
tributary	26
song.	26
My	26
soul,	26
from	26
this	26
strait	26
prison-house	26
set	26
free,	26
As	26
o’er	26
the	26
Stygian	26
lake	26
it	26
floats	26
along,	26
Thy	26
praises	26
singing	26
still	26
shall	26
hold	26
its	26
way,	26
And	26
make	26
the	26
waters	26
of	26
oblivion	26
stay.	26
At	26
this	26
point	26
one	26
of	26
the	26
two	26
that	26
looked	26
like	26
kings	26
exclaimed,	26
“Enough,	26
enough,	26
divine	26
singer!	26
It	26
would	26
be	26
an	26
endless	26
task	26
to	26
put	26
before	26
us	26
now	26
the	26
death	26
and	26
the	26
charms	26
of	26
the	26
peerless	26
Altisidora,	26
not	26
dead	26
as	26
the	26
ignorant	26
world	26
imagines,	26
but	26
living	26
in	26
the	26
voice	26
of	26
fame	26
and	26
in	26
the	26
penance	26
which	26
Sancho	26
Panza,	26
here	26
present,	26
has	26
to	26
undergo	26
to	26
restore	26
her	26
to	26
the	26
long-lost	26
light.	26
Do	26
thou,	26
therefore,	26
O	26
Rhadamanthus,	26
who	26
sittest	26
in	26
judgment	26
with	26
me	26
in	26
the	26
murky	26
caverns	26
of	26
Dis,	26
as	26
thou	26
knowest	26
all	26
that	26
the	26
inscrutable	26
fates	26
have	26
decreed	26
touching	26
the	26
resuscitation	26
of	26
this	26
damsel,	26
announce	26
and	26
declare	26
it	26
at	26
once,	26
that	26
the	26
happiness	26
we	26
look	26
forward	26
to	26
from	26
her	26
restoration	26
be	26
no	26
longer	26
deferred.”	26
No	26
sooner	26
had	26
Minos	26
the	26
fellow	26
judge	26
of	26
Rhadamanthus	26
said	26
this,	26
than	26
Rhadamanthus	26
rising	26
up	26
said:	26
“Ho,	26
officials	26
of	26
this	26
house,	26
high	26
and	26
low,	26
great	26
and	26
small,	26
make	26
haste	26
hither	26
one	26
and	26
all,	26
and	26
print	26
on	26
Sancho’s	26
face	26
four-and-twenty	26
smacks,	26
and	26
give	26
him	26
twelve	26
pinches	26
and	26
six	26
pin	26
thrusts	26
in	26
the	26
back	26
and	26
arms;	26
for	26
upon	26
this	26
ceremony	26
depends	26
the	26
restoration	26
of	26
Altisidora.”	26
On	26
hearing	26
this	26
Sancho	26
broke	26
silence	26
and	26
cried	26
out,	26
“By	26
all	26
that’s	26
good,	26
I’ll	26
as	26
soon	26
let	26
my	26
face	26
be	26
smacked	26
or	26
handled	26
as	26
turn	26
Moor.	26
Body	26
o’	26
me!	26
What	26
has	26
handling	26
my	26
face	26
got	26
to	26
do	26
with	26
the	26
resurrection	26
of	26
this	26
damsel?	26
‘The	26
old	26
woman	26
took	26
kindly	26
to	26
the	26
blits;	26
they	26
enchant	26
Dulcinea,	26
and	26
whip	26
me	26
in	26
order	26
to	26
disenchant	26
her;	26
Altisidora	26
dies	26
of	26
ailments	26
God	26
was	26
pleased	26
to	26
send	26
her,	26
and	26
to	26
bring	26
her	26
to	26
life	26
again	26
they	26
must	26
give	26
me	26
four-and-twenty	26
smacks,	26
and	26
prick	26
holes	26
in	26
my	26
body	26
with	26
pins,	26
and	26
raise	26
weals	26
on	26
my	26
arms	26
with	26
pinches!	26
Try	26
those	26
jokes	26
on	26
a	26
brother-in-law;	26
‘I’m	26
an	26
old	26
dog,	26
and	26
“tus,	26
tus”	26
is	26
no	26
use	26
with	26
me.’”	26
“Thou	26
shalt	26
die,”	26
said	26
Rhadamanthus	26
in	26
a	26
loud	26
voice;	26
“relent,	26
thou	26
tiger;	26
humble	26
thyself,	26
proud	26
Nimrod;	26
suffer	26
and	26
he	26
silent,	26
for	26
no	26
impossibilities	26
are	26
asked	26
of	26
thee;	26
it	26
is	26
not	26
for	26
thee	26
to	26
inquire	26
into	26
the	26
difficulties	26
in	26
this	26
matter;	26
smacked	26
thou	26
must	26
be,	26
pricked	26
thou	26
shalt	26
see	26
thyself,	26
and	26
with	26
pinches	26
thou	26
must	26
be	26
made	26
to	26
howl.	26
Ho,	26
I	26
say,	26
officials,	26
obey	26
my	26
orders;	26
or	26
by	26
the	26
word	26
of	26
an	26
honest	26
man,	26
ye	26
shall	26
see	26
what	26
ye	26
were	26
born	26
for.”	26
At	26
this	26
some	26
six	26
duennas,	26
advancing	26
across	26
the	26
court,	26
made	26
their	26
appearance	26
in	26
procession,	26
one	26
after	26
the	26
other,	26
four	26
of	26
them	26
with	26
spectacles,	26
and	26
all	26
with	26
their	26
right	26
hands	26
uplifted,	26
showing	26
four	26
fingers	26
of	26
wrist	26
to	26
make	26
their	26
hands	26
look	26
longer,	26
as	26
is	26
the	26
fashion	26
now-a-days.	26
No	26
sooner	26
had	26
Sancho	26
caught	26
sight	26
of	26
them	26
than,	26
bellowing	26
like	26
a	26
bull,	26
he	26
exclaimed,	26
“I	26
might	26
let	26
myself	26
be	26
handled	26
by	26
all	26
the	26
world;	26
but	26
allow	26
duennas	26
to	26
touch	26
me—not	26
a	26
bit	26
of	26
it!	26
Scratch	26
my	26
face,	26
as	26
my	26
master	26
was	26
served	26
in	26
this	26
very	26
castle;	26
run	26
me	26
through	26
the	26
body	26
with	26
burnished	26
daggers;	26
pinch	26
my	26
arms	26
with	26
red-hot	26
pincers;	26
I’ll	26
bear	26
all	26
in	26
patience	26
to	26
serve	26
these	26
gentlefolk;	26
but	26
I	26
won’t	26
let	26
duennas	26
touch	26
me,	26
though	26
the	26
devil	26
should	26
carry	26
me	26
off!”	26
Here	26
Don	26
Quixote,	26
too,	26
broke	26
silence,	26
saying	26
to	26
Sancho,	26
“Have	26
patience,	26
my	26
son,	26
and	26
gratify	26
these	26
noble	26
persons,	26
and	26
give	26
all	26
thanks	26
to	26
heaven	26
that	26
it	26
has	26
infused	26
such	26
virtue	26
into	26
thy	26
person,	26
that	26
by	26
its	26
sufferings	26
thou	26
canst	26
disenchant	26
the	26
enchanted	26
and	26
restore	26
to	26
life	26
the	26
dead.”	26
The	26
duennas	26
were	26
now	26
close	26
to	26
Sancho,	26
and	26
he,	26
having	26
become	26
more	26
tractable	26
and	26
reasonable,	26
settling	26
himself	26
well	26
in	26
his	26
chair	26
presented	26
his	26
face	26
and	26
beard	26
to	26
the	26
first,	26
who	26
delivered	26
him	26
a	26
smack	26
very	26
stoutly	26
laid	26
on,	26
and	26
then	26
made	26
him	26
a	26
low	26
curtsey.	26
“Less	26
politeness	26
and	26
less	26
paint,	26
señora	26
duenna,”	26
said	26
Sancho;	26
“by	26
God	26
your	26
hands	26
smell	26
of	26
vinegar-wash.”	26
In	26
line,	26
all	26
the	26
duennas	26
smacked	26
him	26
and	26
several	26
others	26
of	26
the	26
household	26
pinched	26
him;	26
but	26
what	26
he	26
could	26
not	26
stand	26
was	26
being	26
pricked	26
by	26
the	26
pins;	26
and	26
so,	26
apparently	26
out	26
of	26
patience,	26
he	26
started	26
up	26
out	26
of	26
his	26
chair,	26
and	26
seizing	26
a	26
lighted	26
torch	26
that	26
stood	26
near	26
him	26
fell	26
upon	26
the	26
duennas	26
and	26
the	26
whole	26
set	26
of	26
his	26
tormentors,	26
exclaiming,	26
“Begone,	26
ye	26
ministers	26
of	26
hell;	26
I’m	26
not	26
made	26
of	26
brass	26
not	26
to	26
feel	26
such	26
out-of-the-way	26
tortures.”	26
At	26
this	26
instant	26
Altisidora,	26
who	26
probably	26
was	26
tired	26
of	26
having	26
been	26
so	26
long	26
lying	26
on	26
her	26
back,	26
turned	26
on	26
her	26
side;	26
seeing	26
which	26
the	26
bystanders	26
cried	26
out	26
almost	26
with	26
one	26
voice,	26
“Altisidora	26
is	26
alive!	26
Altisidora	26
lives!”	26
Rhadamanthus	26
bade	26
Sancho	26
put	26
away	26
his	26
wrath,	26
as	26
the	26
object	26
they	26
had	26
in	26
view	26
was	26
now	26
attained.	26
When	26
Don	26
Quixote	26
saw	26
Altisidora	26
move,	26
he	26
went	26
on	26
his	26
knees	26
to	26
Sancho	26
saying	26
to	26
him,	26
“Now	26
is	26
the	26
time,	26
son	26
of	26
my	26
bowels,	26
not	26
to	26
call	26
thee	26
my	26
squire,	26
for	26
thee	26
to	26
give	26
thyself	26
some	26
of	26
those	26
lashes	26
thou	26
art	26
bound	26
to	26
lay	26
on	26
for	26
the	26
disenchantment	26
of	26
Dulcinea.	26
Now,	26
I	26
say,	26
is	26
the	26
time	26
when	26
the	26
virtue	26
that	26
is	26
in	26
thee	26
is	26
ripe,	26
and	26
endowed	26
with	26
efficacy	26
to	26
work	26
the	26
good	26
that	26
is	26
looked	26
for	26
from	26
thee.”	26
To	26
which	26
Sancho	26
made	26
answer,	26
“That’s	26
trick	26
upon	26
trick,	26
I	26
think,	26
and	26
not	26
honey	26
upon	26
pancakes;	26
a	26
nice	26
thing	26
it	26
would	26
be	26
for	26
a	26
whipping	26
to	26
come	26
now,	26
on	26
the	26
top	26
of	26
pinches,	26
smacks,	26
and	26
pin-proddings!	26
You	26
had	26
better	26
take	26
a	26
big	26
stone	26
and	26
tie	26
it	26
round	26
my	26
neck,	26
and	26
pitch	26
me	26
into	26
a	26
well;	26
I	26
should	26
not	26
mind	26
it	26
much,	26
if	26
I’m	26
to	26
be	26
always	26
made	26
the	26
cow	26
of	26
the	26
wedding	26
for	26
the	26
cure	26
of	26
other	26
people’s	26
ailments.	26
Leave	26
me	26
alone;	26
or	26
else	26
by	26
God	26
I’ll	26
fling	26
the	26
whole	26
thing	26
to	26
the	26
dogs,	26
let	26
come	26
what	26
may.”	26
Altisidora	26
had	26
by	26
this	26
time	26
sat	26
up	26
on	26
the	26
catafalque,	26
and	26
as	26
she	26
did	26
so	26
the	26
clarions	26
sounded,	26
accompanied	26
by	26
the	26
flutes,	26
and	26
the	26
voices	26
of	26
all	26
present	26
exclaiming,	26
“Long	26
life	26
to	26
Altisidora!	26
long	26
life	26
to	26
Altisidora!”	26
The	26
duke	26
and	26
duchess	26
and	26
the	26
kings	26
Minos	26
and	26
Rhadamanthus	26
stood	26
up,	26
and	26
all,	26
together	26
with	26
Don	26
Quixote	26
and	26
Sancho,	26
advanced	26
to	26
receive	26
her	26
and	26
take	26
her	26
down	26
from	26
the	26
catafalque;	26
and	26
she,	26
making	26
as	26
though	26
she	26
were	26
recovering	26
from	26
a	26
swoon,	26
bowed	26
her	26
head	26
to	26
the	26
duke	26
and	26
duchess	26
and	26
to	26
the	26
kings,	26
and	26
looking	26
sideways	26
at	26
Don	26
Quixote,	26
said	26
to	26
him,	26
“God	26
forgive	26
thee,	26
insensible	26
knight,	26
for	26
through	26
thy	26
cruelty	26
I	26
have	26
been,	26
to	26
me	26
it	26
seems,	26
more	26
than	26
a	26
thousand	26
years	26
in	26
the	26
other	26
world;	26
and	26
to	26
thee,	26
the	26
most	26
compassionate	26
upon	26
earth,	26
I	26
render	26
thanks	26
for	26
the	26
life	26
I	26
am	26
now	26
in	26
possession	26
of.	26
From	26
this	26
day	26
forth,	26
friend	26
Sancho,	26
count	26
as	26
thine	26
six	26
smocks	26
of	26
mine	26
which	26
I	26
bestow	26
upon	26
thee,	26
to	26
make	26
as	26
many	26
shirts	26
for	26
thyself,	26
and	26
if	26
they	26
are	26
not	26
all	26
quite	26
whole,	26
at	26
any	26
rate	26
they	26
are	26
all	26
clean.”	26
Sancho	26
kissed	26
her	26
hands	26
in	26
gratitude,	26
kneeling,	26
and	26
with	26
the	26
mitre	26
in	26
his	26
hand.	26
The	26
duke	26
bade	26
them	26
take	26
it	26
from	26
him,	26
and	26
give	26
him	26
back	26
his	26
cap	26
and	26
doublet	26
and	26
remove	26
the	26
flaming	26
robe.	26
Sancho	26
begged	26
the	26
duke	26
to	26
let	26
them	26
leave	26
him	26
the	26
robe	26
and	26
mitre;	26
as	26
he	26
wanted	26
to	26
take	26
them	26
home	26
for	26
a	26
token	26
and	26
memento	26
of	26
that	26
unexampled	26
adventure.	26
The	26
duchess	26
said	26
they	26
must	26
leave	26
them	26
with	26
him;	26
for	26
he	26
knew	26
already	26
what	26
a	26
great	26
friend	26
of	26
his	26
she	26
was.	26
The	26
duke	26
then	26
gave	26
orders	26
that	26
the	26
court	26
should	26
be	26
cleared,	26
and	26
that	26
all	26
should	26
retire	26
to	26
their	26
chambers,	26
and	26
that	26
Don	26
Quixote	26
and	26
Sancho	26
should	26
be	26
conducted	26
to	26
their	26
old	26
quarters.	26

Sancho	26
slept	26
that	26
night	26
in	26
a	26
cot	26
in	26
the	26
same	26
chamber	26
with	26
Don	26
Quixote,	26
a	26
thing	26
he	26
would	26
have	26
gladly	26
excused	26
if	26
he	26
could	26
for	26
he	26
knew	26
very	26
well	26
that	26
with	26
questions	26
and	26
answers	26
his	26
master	26
would	26
not	26
let	26
him	26
sleep,	26
and	26
he	26
was	26
in	26
no	26
humour	26
for	26
talking	26
much,	26
as	26
he	26
still	26
felt	26
the	26
pain	26
of	26
his	26
late	26
martyrdom,	26
which	26
interfered	26
with	26
his	26
freedom	26
of	26
speech;	26
and	26
it	26
would	26
have	26
been	26
more	26
to	26
his	26
taste	26
to	26
sleep	26
in	26
a	26
hovel	26
alone,	26
than	26
in	26
that	26
luxurious	26
chamber	26
in	26
company.	26
And	26
so	26
well	26
founded	26
did	26
his	26
apprehension	26
prove,	26
and	26
so	26
correct	26
was	26
his	26
anticipation,	26
that	26
scarcely	26
had	26
his	26
master	26
got	26
into	26
bed	26
when	26
he	26
said,	26
“What	26
dost	26
thou	26
think	26
of	26
to-night’s	26
adventure,	26
Sancho?	26
Great	26
and	26
mighty	26
is	26
the	26
power	26
of	26
cold-hearted	26
scorn,	26
for	26
thou	26
with	26
thine	26
own	26
eyes	26
hast	26
seen	26
Altisidora	26
slain,	26
not	26
by	26
arrows,	26
nor	26
by	26
the	26
sword,	26
nor	26
by	26
any	26
warlike	26
weapon,	26
nor	26
by	26
deadly	26
poisons,	26
but	26
by	26
the	26
thought	26
of	26
the	26
sternness	26
and	26
scorn	26
with	26
which	26
I	26
have	26
always	26
treated	26
her.”	26
“She	26
might	26
have	26
died	26
and	26
welcome,”	26
said	26
Sancho,	26
“when	26
she	26
pleased	26
and	26
how	26
she	26
pleased;	26
and	26
she	26
might	26
have	26
left	26
me	26
alone,	26
for	26
I	26
never	26
made	26
her	26
fall	26
in	26
love	26
or	26
scorned	26
her.	26
I	26
don’t	26
know	26
nor	26
can	26
I	26
imagine	26
how	26
the	26
recovery	26
of	26
Altisidora,	26
a	26
damsel	26
more	26
fanciful	26
than	26
wise,	26
can	26
have,	26
as	26
I	26
have	26
said	26
before,	26
anything	26
to	26
do	26
with	26
the	26
sufferings	26
of	26
Sancho	26
Panza.	26
Now	26
I	26
begin	26
to	26
see	26
plainly	26
and	26
clearly	26
that	26
there	26
are	26
enchanters	26
and	26
enchanted	26
people	26
in	26
the	26
world;	26
and	26
may	26
God	26
deliver	26
me	26
from	26
them,	26
since	26
I	26
can’t	26
deliver	26
myself;	26
and	26
so	26
I	26
beg	26
of	26
your	26
worship	26
to	26
let	26
me	26
sleep	26
and	26
not	26
ask	26
me	26
any	26
more	26
questions,	26
unless	26
you	26
want	26
me	26
to	26
throw	26
myself	26
out	26
of	26
the	26
window.”	26
“Sleep,	26
Sancho	26
my	26
friend,”	26
said	26
Don	26
Quixote,	26
“if	26
the	26
pinprodding	26
and	26
pinches	26
thou	26
hast	26
received	26
and	26
the	26
smacks	26
administered	26
to	26
thee	26
will	26
let	26
thee.”	26
“No	26
pain	26
came	26
up	26
to	26
the	26
insult	26
of	26
the	26
smacks,”	26
said	26
Sancho,	26
“for	26
the	26
simple	26
reason	26
that	26
it	26
was	26
duennas,	26
confound	26
them,	26
that	26
gave	26
them	26
to	26
me;	26
but	26
once	26
more	26
I	26
entreat	26
your	26
worship	26
to	26
let	26
me	26
sleep,	26
for	26
sleep	26
is	26
relief	26
from	26
misery	26
to	26
those	26
who	26
are	26
miserable	26
when	26
awake.”	26
“Be	26
it	26
so,	26
and	26
God	26
be	26
with	26
thee,”	26
said	26
Don	26
Quixote.	26
They	26
fell	26
asleep,	26
both	26
of	26
them,	26
and	26
Cide	26
Hamete,	26
the	26
author	26
of	26
this	26
great	26
history,	26
took	26
this	26
opportunity	26
to	26
record	26
and	26
relate	26
what	26
it	26
was	26
that	26
induced	26
the	26
duke	26
and	26
duchess	26
to	26
get	26
up	26
the	26
elaborate	26
plot	26
that	26
has	26
been	26
described.	26
The	26
bachelor	26
Samson	26
Carrasco,	26
he	26
says,	26
not	26
forgetting	26
how	26
he	26
as	26
the	26
Knight	26
of	26
the	26
Mirrors	26
had	26
been	26
vanquished	26
and	26
overthrown	26
by	26
Don	26
Quixote,	26
which	26
defeat	26
and	26
overthrow	26
upset	26
all	26
his	26
plans,	26
resolved	26
to	26
try	26
his	26
hand	26
again,	26
hoping	26
for	26
better	26
luck	26
than	26
he	26
had	26
before;	26
and	26
so,	26
having	26
learned	26
where	26
Don	26
Quixote	26
was	26
from	26
the	26
page	26
who	26
brought	26
the	26
letter	26
and	26
present	26
to	26
Sancho’s	26
wife,	26
Teresa	26
Panza,	26
he	26
got	26
himself	26
new	26
armour	26
and	26
another	26
horse,	26
and	26
put	26
a	26
white	26
moon	26
upon	26
his	26
shield,	26
and	26
to	26
carry	26
his	26
arms	26
he	26
had	26
a	26
mule	26
led	26
by	26
a	26
peasant,	26
not	26
by	26
Tom	26
Cecial	26
his	26
former	26
squire	26
for	26
fear	26
he	26
should	26
be	26
recognised	26
by	26
Sancho	26
or	26
Don	26
Quixote.	26
He	26
came	26
to	26
the	26
duke’s	26
castle,	26
and	26
the	26
duke	26
informed	26
him	26
of	26
the	26
road	26
and	26
route	26
Don	26
Quixote	26
had	26
taken	26
with	26
the	26
intention	26
of	26
being	26
present	26
at	26
the	26
jousts	26
at	26
Saragossa.	26
He	26
told	26
him,	26
too,	26
of	26
the	26
jokes	26
he	26
had	26
practised	26
upon	26
him,	26
and	26
of	26
the	26
device	26
for	26
the	26
disenchantment	26
of	26
Dulcinea	26
at	26
the	26
expense	26
of	26
Sancho’s	26
backside;	26
and	26
finally	26
he	26
gave	26
him	26
an	26
account	26
of	26
the	26
trick	26
Sancho	26
had	26
played	26
upon	26
his	26
master,	26
making	26
him	26
believe	26
that	26
Dulcinea	26
was	26
enchanted	26
and	26
turned	26
into	26
a	26
country	26
wench;	26
and	26
of	26
how	26
the	26
duchess,	26
his	26
wife,	26
had	26
persuaded	26
Sancho	26
that	26
it	26
was	26
he	26
himself	26
who	26
was	26
deceived,	26
inasmuch	26
as	26
Dulcinea	26
was	26
really	26
enchanted;	26
at	26
which	26
the	26
bachelor	26
laughed	26
not	26
a	26
little,	26
and	26
marvelled	26
as	26
well	26
at	26
the	26
sharpness	26
and	26
simplicity	26
of	26
Sancho	26
as	26
at	26
the	26
length	26
to	26
which	26
Don	26
Quixote’s	26
madness	26
went.	26
The	26
duke	26
begged	26
of	26
him	26
if	26
he	26
found	26
him	26
(whether	26
he	26
overcame	26
him	26
or	26
not)	26
to	26
return	26
that	26
way	26
and	26
let	26
him	26
know	26
the	26
result.	26
This	26
the	26
bachelor	26
did;	26
he	26
set	26
out	26
in	26
quest	26
of	26
Don	26
Quixote,	26
and	26
not	26
finding	26
him	26
at	26
Saragossa,	26
he	26
went	26
on,	26
and	26
how	26
he	26
fared	26
has	26
been	26
already	26
told.	26
He	26
returned	26
to	26
the	26
duke’s	26
castle	26
and	26
told	26
him	26
all,	26
what	26
the	26
conditions	26
of	26
the	26
combat	26
were,	26
and	26
how	26
Don	26
Quixote	26
was	26
now,	26
like	26
a	26
loyal	26
knight-errant,	26
returning	26
to	26
keep	26
his	26
promise	26
of	26
retiring	26
to	26
his	26
village	26
for	26
a	26
year,	26
by	26
which	26
time,	26
said	26
the	26
bachelor,	26
he	26
might	26
perhaps	26
be	26
cured	26
of	26
his	26
madness;	26
for	26
that	26
was	26
the	26
object	26
that	26
had	26
led	26
him	26
to	26
adopt	26
these	26
disguises,	26
as	26
it	26
was	26
a	26
sad	26
thing	26
for	26
a	26
gentleman	26
of	26
such	26
good	26
parts	26
as	26
Don	26
Quixote	26
to	26
be	26
a	26
madman.	26
And	26
so	26
he	26
took	26
his	26
leave	26
of	26
the	26
duke,	26
and	26
went	26
home	26
to	26
his	26
village	26
to	26
wait	26
there	26
for	26
Don	26
Quixote,	26
who	26
was	26
coming	26
after	26
him.	26
Thereupon	26
the	26
duke	26
seized	26
the	26
opportunity	26
of	26
practising	26
this	26
mystification	26
upon	26
him;	26
so	26
much	26
did	26
he	26
enjoy	26
everything	26
connected	26
with	26
Sancho	26
and	26
Don	26
Quixote.	26
He	26
had	26
the	26
roads	26
about	26
the	26
castle	26
far	26
and	26
near,	26
everywhere	26
he	26
thought	26
Don	26
Quixote	26
was	26
likely	26
to	26
pass	26
on	26
his	26
return,	26
occupied	26
by	26
large	26
numbers	26
of	26
his	26
servants	26
on	26
foot	26
and	26
on	26
horseback,	26
who	26
were	26
to	26
bring	26
him	26
to	26
the	26
castle,	26
by	26
fair	26
means	26
or	26
foul,	26
if	26
they	26
met	26
him.	26
They	26
did	26
meet	26
him,	26
and	26
sent	26
word	26
to	26
the	26
duke,	26
who,	26
having	26
already	26
settled	26
what	26
was	26
to	26
be	26
done,	26
as	26
soon	26
as	26
he	26
heard	26
of	26
his	26
arrival,	26
ordered	26
the	26
torches	26
and	26
lamps	26
in	26
the	26
court	26
to	26
be	26
lit	26
and	26
Altisidora	26
to	26
be	26
placed	26
on	26
the	26
catafalque	26
with	26
all	26
the	26
pomp	26
and	26
ceremony	26
that	26
has	26
been	26
described,	26
the	26
whole	26
affair	26
being	26
so	26
well	26
arranged	26
and	26
acted	26
that	26
it	26
differed	26
but	26
little	26
from	26
reality.	26
And	26
Cide	26
Hamete	26
says,	26
moreover,	26
that	26
for	26
his	26
part	26
he	26
considers	26
the	26
concocters	26
of	26
the	26
joke	26
as	26
crazy	26
as	26
the	26
victims	26
of	26
it,	26
and	26
that	26
the	26
duke	26
and	26
duchess	26
were	26
not	26
two	26
fingers’	26
breadth	26
removed	26
from	26
being	26
something	26
like	26
fools	26
themselves	26
when	26
they	26
took	26
such	26
pains	26
to	26
make	26
game	26
of	26
a	26
pair	26
of	26
fools.	26
As	26
for	26
the	26
latter,	26
one	26
was	26
sleeping	26
soundly	26
and	26
the	26
other	26
lying	26
awake	26
occupied	26
with	26
his	26
desultory	26
thoughts,	26
when	26
daylight	26
came	26
to	26
them	26
bringing	26
with	26
it	26
the	26
desire	26
to	26
rise;	26
for	26
the	26
lazy	26
down	26
was	26
never	26
a	26
delight	26
to	26
Don	26
Quixote,	26
victor	26
or	26
vanquished.	26
Altisidora,	26
come	26
back	26
from	26
death	26
to	26
life	26
as	26
Don	26
Quixote	26
fancied,	26
following	26
up	26
the	26
freak	26
of	26
her	26
lord	26
and	26
lady,	26
entered	26
the	26
chamber,	26
crowned	26
with	26
the	26
garland	26
she	26
had	26
worn	26
on	26
the	26
catafalque	26
and	26
in	26
a	26
robe	26
of	26
white	26
taffeta	26
embroidered	26
with	26
gold	26
flowers,	26
her	26
hair	26
flowing	26
loose	26
over	26
her	26
shoulders,	26
and	26
leaning	26
upon	26
a	26
staff	26
of	26
fine	26
black	26
ebony.	26
Don	26
Quixote,	26
disconcerted	26
and	26
in	26
confusion	26
at	26
her	26
appearance,	26
huddled	26
himself	26
up	26
and	26
well-nigh	26
covered	26
himself	26
altogether	26
with	26
the	26
sheets	26
and	26
counterpane	26
of	26
the	26
bed,	26
tongue-tied,	26
and	26
unable	26
to	26
offer	26
her	26
any	26
civility.	26
Altisidora	26
seated	26
herself	26
on	26
a	26
chair	26
at	26
the	26
head	26
of	26
the	26
bed,	26
and,	26
after	26
a	26
deep	26
sigh,	26
said	26
to	26
him	26
in	26
a	26
feeble,	26
soft	26
voice,	26
“When	26
women	26
of	26
rank	26
and	26
modest	26
maidens	26
trample	26
honour	26
under	26
foot,	26
and	26
give	26
a	26
loose	26
to	26
the	26
tongue	26
that	26
breaks	26
through	26
every	26
impediment,	26
publishing	26
abroad	26
the	26
inmost	26
secrets	26
of	26
their	26
hearts,	26
they	26
are	26
reduced	26
to	26
sore	26
extremities.	26
Such	26
a	26
one	26
am	26
I,	26
Señor	26
Don	26
Quixote	26
of	26
La	26
Mancha,	26
crushed,	26
conquered,	26
love-smitten,	26
but	26
yet	26
patient	26
under	26
suffering	26
and	26
virtuous,	26
and	26
so	26
much	26
so	26
that	26
my	26
heart	26
broke	26
with	26
grief	26
and	26
I	26
lost	26
my	26
life.	26
For	26
the	26
last	26
two	26
days	26
I	26
have	26
been	26
dead,	26
slain	26
by	26
the	26
thought	26
of	26
the	26
cruelty	26
with	26
which	26
thou	26
hast	26
treated	26
me,	26
obdurate	26
knight,	26
O	26
harder	26
thou	26
than	26
marble	26
to	26
my	26
plaint;	26
or	26
at	26
least	26
believed	26
to	26
be	26
dead	26
by	26
all	26
who	26
saw	26
me;	26
and	26
had	26
it	26
not	26
been	26
that	26
Love,	26
taking	26
pity	26
on	26
me,	26
let	26
my	26
recovery	26
rest	26
upon	26
the	26
sufferings	26
of	26
this	26
good	26
squire,	26
there	26
I	26
should	26
have	26
remained	26
in	26
the	26
other	26
world.”	26
“Love	26
might	26
very	26
well	26
have	26
let	26
it	26
rest	26
upon	26
the	26
sufferings	26
of	26
my	26
ass,	26
and	26
I	26
should	26
have	26
been	26
obliged	26
to	26
him,”	26
said	26
Sancho.	26
“But	26
tell	26
me,	26
señora—and	26
may	26
heaven	26
send	26
you	26
a	26
tenderer	26
lover	26
than	26
my	26
master—what	26
did	26
you	26
see	26
in	26
the	26
other	26
world?	26
What	26
goes	26
on	26
in	26
hell?	26
For	26
of	26
course	26
that’s	26
where	26
one	26
who	26
dies	26
in	26
despair	26
is	26
bound	26
for.”	26
“To	26
tell	26
you	26
the	26
truth,”	26
said	26
Altisidora,	26
“I	26
cannot	26
have	26
died	26
outright,	26
for	26
I	26
did	26
not	26
go	26
into	26
hell;	26
had	26
I	26
gone	26
in,	26
it	26
is	26
very	26
certain	26
I	26
should	26
never	26
have	26
come	26
out	26
again,	26
do	26
what	26
I	26
might.	26
The	26
truth	26
is,	26
I	26
came	26
to	26
the	26
gate,	26
where	26
some	26
dozen	26
or	26
so	26
of	26
devils	26
were	26
playing	26
tennis,	26
all	26
in	26
breeches	26
and	26
doublets,	26
with	26
falling	26
collars	26
trimmed	26
with	26
Flemish	26
bonelace,	26
and	26
ruffles	26
of	26
the	26
same	26
that	26
served	26
them	26
for	26
wristbands,	26
with	26
four	26
fingers’	26
breadth	26
of	26
the	26
arms	26
exposed	26
to	26
make	26
their	26
hands	26
look	26
longer;	26
in	26
their	26
hands	26
they	26
held	26
rackets	26
of	26
fire;	26
but	26
what	26
amazed	26
me	26
still	26
more	26
was	26
that	26
books,	26
apparently	26
full	26
of	26
wind	26
and	26
rubbish,	26
served	26
them	26
for	26
tennis	26
balls,	26
a	26
strange	26
and	26
marvellous	26
thing;	26
this,	26
however,	26
did	26
not	26
astonish	26
me	26
so	26
much	26
as	26
to	26
observe	26
that,	26
although	26
with	26
players	26
it	26
is	26
usual	26
for	26
the	26
winners	26
to	26
be	26
glad	26
and	26
the	26
losers	26
sorry,	26
there	26
in	26
that	26
game	26
all	26
were	26
growling,	26
all	26
were	26
snarling,	26
and	26
all	26
were	26
cursing	26
one	26
another.”	26
“That’s	26
no	26
wonder,”	26
said	26
Sancho;	26
“for	26
devils,	26
whether	26
playing	26
or	26
not,	26
can	26
never	26
be	26
content,	26
win	26
or	26
lose.”	26
“Very	26
likely,”	26
said	26
Altisidora;	26
“but	26
there	26
is	26
another	26
thing	26
that	26
surprises	26
me	26
too,	26
I	26
mean	26
surprised	26
me	26
then,	26
and	26
that	26
was	26
that	26
no	26
ball	26
outlasted	26
the	26
first	26
throw	26
or	26
was	26
of	26
any	26
use	26
a	26
second	26
time;	26
and	26
it	26
was	26
wonderful	26
the	26
constant	26
succession	26
there	26
was	26
of	26
books,	26
new	26
and	26
old.	26
To	26
one	26
of	26
them,	26
a	26
brand-new,	26
well-bound	26
one,	26
they	26
gave	26
such	26
a	26
stroke	26
that	26
they	26
knocked	26
the	26
guts	26
out	26
of	26
it	26
and	26
scattered	26
the	26
leaves	26
about.	26
‘Look	26
what	26
book	26
that	26
is,’	26
said	26
one	26
devil	26
to	26
another,	26
and	26
the	26
other	26
replied,	26
‘It	26
is	26
the	26
“Second	26
Part	26
of	26
the	26
History	26
of	26
Don	26
Quixote	26
of	26
La	26
Mancha,”	26
not	26
by	26
Cide	26
Hamete,	26
the	26
original	26
author,	26
but	26
by	26
an	26
Aragonese	26
who	26
by	26
his	26
own	26
account	26
is	26
of	26
Tordesillas.’	26
‘Out	26
of	26
this	26
with	26
it,’	26
said	26
the	26
first,	26
‘and	26
into	26
the	26
depths	26
of	26
hell	26
with	26
it	26
out	26
of	26
my	26
sight.’	26
‘Is	26
it	26
so	26
bad?’	26
said	26
the	26
other.	26
‘So	26
bad	26
is	26
it,’	26
said	26
the	26
first,	26
‘that	26
if	26
I	26
had	26
set	26
myself	26
deliberately	26
to	26
make	26
a	26
worse,	26
I	26
could	26
not	26
have	26
done	26
it.’	26
They	26
then	26
went	26
on	26
with	26
their	26
game,	26
knocking	26
other	26
books	26
about;	26
and	26
I,	26
having	26
heard	26
them	26
mention	26
the	26
name	26
of	26
Don	26
Quixote	26
whom	26
I	26
love	26
and	26
adore	26
so,	26
took	26
care	26
to	26
retain	26
this	26
vision	26
in	26
my	26
memory.”	26
“A	26
vision	26
it	26
must	26
have	26
been,	26
no	26
doubt,”	26
said	26
Don	26
Quixote,	26
“for	26
there	26
is	26
no	26
other	26
I	26
in	26
the	26
world;	26
this	26
history	26
has	26
been	26
going	26
about	26
here	26
for	26
some	26
time	26
from	26
hand	26
to	26
hand,	26
but	26
it	26
does	26
not	26
stay	26
long	26
in	26
any,	26
for	26
everybody	26
gives	26
it	26
a	26
taste	26
of	26
his	26
foot.	26
I	26
am	26
not	26
disturbed	26
by	26
hearing	26
that	26
I	26
am	26
wandering	26
in	26
a	26
fantastic	26
shape	26
in	26
the	26
darkness	26
of	26
the	26
pit	26
or	26
in	26
the	26
daylight	26
above,	26
for	26
I	26
am	26
not	26
the	26
one	26
that	26
history	26
treats	26
of.	26
If	26
it	26
should	26
be	26
good,	26
faithful,	26
and	26
true,	26
it	26
will	26
have	26
ages	26
of	26
life;	26
but	26
if	26
it	26
should	26
be	26
bad,	26
from	26
its	26
birth	26
to	26
its	26
burial	26
will	26
not	26
be	26
a	26
very	26
long	26
journey.”	26
Altisidora	26
was	26
about	26
to	26
proceed	26
with	26
her	26
complaint	26
against	26
Don	26
Quixote,	26
when	26
he	26
said	26
to	26
her,	26
“I	26
have	26
several	26
times	26
told	26
you,	26
señora	26
that	26
it	26
grieves	26
me	26
you	26
should	26
have	26
set	26
your	26
affections	26
upon	26
me,	26
as	26
from	26
mine	26
they	26
can	26
only	26
receive	26
gratitude,	26
but	26
no	26
return.	26
I	26
was	26
born	26
to	26
belong	26
to	26
Dulcinea	26
del	26
Toboso,	26
and	26
the	26
fates,	26
if	26
there	26
are	26
any,	26
dedicated	26
me	26
to	26
her;	26
and	26
to	26
suppose	26
that	26
any	26
other	26
beauty	26
can	26
take	26
the	26
place	26
she	26
occupies	26
in	26
my	26
heart	26
is	26
to	26
suppose	26
an	26
impossibility.	26
This	26
frank	26
declaration	26
should	26
suffice	26
to	26
make	26
you	26
retire	26
within	26
the	26
bounds	26
of	26
your	26
modesty,	26
for	26
no	26
one	26
can	26
bind	26
himself	26
to	26
do	26
impossibilities.”	26
Hearing	26
this,	26
Altisidora,	26
with	26
a	26
show	26
of	26
anger	26
and	26
agitation,	26
exclaimed,	26
“God’s	26
life!	26
Don	26
Stockfish,	26
soul	26
of	26
a	26
mortar,	26
stone	26
of	26
a	26
date,	26
more	26
obstinate	26
and	26
obdurate	26
than	26
a	26
clown	26
asked	26
a	26
favour	26
when	26
he	26
has	26
his	26
mind	26
made	26
up,	26
if	26
I	26
fall	26
upon	26
you	26
I’ll	26
tear	26
your	26
eyes	26
out!	26
Do	26
you	26
fancy,	26
Don	26
Vanquished,	26
Don	26
Cudgelled,	26
that	26
I	26
died	26
for	26
your	26
sake?	26
All	26
that	26
you	26
have	26
seen	26
to-night	26
has	26
been	26
make-believe;	26
I’m	26
not	26
the	26
woman	26
to	26
let	26
the	26
black	26
of	26
my	26
nail	26
suffer	26
for	26
such	26
a	26
camel,	26
much	26
less	26
die!”	26
“That	26
I	26
can	26
well	26
believe,”	26
said	26
Sancho;	26
“for	26
all	26
that	26
about	26
lovers	26
pining	26
to	26
death	26
is	26
absurd;	26
they	26
may	26
talk	26
of	26
it,	26
but	26
as	26
for	26
doing	26
it—Judas	26
may	26
believe	26
that!”	26
While	26
they	26
were	26
talking,	26
the	26
musician,	26
singer,	26
and	26
poet,	26
who	26
had	26
sung	26
the	26
two	26
stanzas	26
given	26
above	26
came	26
in,	26
and	26
making	26
a	26
profound	26
obeisance	26
to	26
Don	26
Quixote	26
said,	26
“Will	26
your	26
worship,	26
sir	26
knight,	26
reckon	26
and	26
retain	26
me	26
in	26
the	26
number	26
of	26
your	26
most	26
faithful	26
servants,	26
for	26
I	26
have	26
long	26
been	26
a	26
great	26
admirer	26
of	26
yours,	26
as	26
well	26
because	26
of	26
your	26
fame	26
as	26
because	26
of	26
your	26
achievements?”	26
“Will	26
your	26
worship	26
tell	26
me	26
who	26
you	26
are,”	26
replied	26
Don	26
Quixote,	26
“so	26
that	26
my	26
courtesy	26
may	26
be	26
answerable	26
to	26
your	26
deserts?”	26
The	26
young	26
man	26
replied	26
that	26
he	26
was	26
the	26
musician	26
and	26
songster	26
of	26
the	26
night	26
before.	26
“Of	26
a	26
truth,”	26
said	26
Don	26
Quixote,	26
“your	26
worship	26
has	26
a	26
most	26
excellent	26
voice;	26
but	26
what	26
you	26
sang	26
did	26
not	26
seem	26
to	26
me	26
very	26
much	26
to	26
the	26
purpose;	26
for	26
what	26
have	26
Garcilasso’s	26
stanzas	26
to	26
do	26
with	26
the	26
death	26
of	26
this	26
lady?”	26
“Don’t	26
be	26
surprised	26
at	26
that,”	26
returned	26
the	26
musician;	26
“for	26
with	26
the	26
callow	26
poets	26
of	26
our	26
day	26
the	26
way	26
is	26
for	26
every	26
one	26
to	26
write	26
as	26
he	26
pleases	26
and	26
pilfer	26
where	26
he	26
chooses,	26
whether	26
it	26
be	26
germane	26
to	26
the	26
matter	26
or	26
not,	26
and	26
now-a-days	26
there	26
is	26
no	26
piece	26
of	26
silliness	26
they	26
can	26
sing	26
or	26
write	26
that	26
is	26
not	26
set	26
down	26
to	26
poetic	26
licence.”	26
Don	26
Quixote	26
was	26
about	26
to	26
reply,	26
but	26
was	26
prevented	26
by	26
the	26
duke	26
and	26
duchess,	26
who	26
came	26
in	26
to	26
see	26
him,	26
and	26
with	26
them	26
there	26
followed	26
a	26
long	26
and	26
delightful	26
conversation,	26
in	26
the	26
course	26
of	26
which	26
Sancho	26
said	26
so	26
many	26
droll	26
and	26
saucy	26
things	26
that	26
he	26
left	26
the	26
duke	26
and	26
duchess	26
wondering	26
not	26
only	26
at	26
his	26
simplicity	26
but	26
at	26
his	26
sharpness.	26
Don	26
Quixote	26
begged	26
their	26
permission	26
to	26
take	26
his	26
departure	26
that	26
same	26
day,	26
inasmuch	26
as	26
for	26
a	26
vanquished	26
knight	26
like	26
himself	26
it	26
was	26
fitter	26
he	26
should	26
live	26
in	26
a	26
pig-sty	26
than	26
in	26
a	26
royal	26
palace.	26
They	26
gave	26
it	26
very	26
readily,	26
and	26
the	26
duchess	26
asked	26
him	26
if	26
Altisidora	26
was	26
in	26
his	26
good	26
graces.	26
He	26
replied,	26
“Señora,	26
let	26
me	26
tell	26
your	26
ladyship	26
that	26
this	26
damsel’s	26
ailment	26
comes	26
entirely	26
of	26
idleness,	26
and	26
the	26
cure	26
for	26
it	26
is	26
honest	26
and	26
constant	26
employment.	26
She	26
herself	26
has	26
told	26
me	26
that	26
lace	26
is	26
worn	26
in	26
hell;	26
and	26
as	26
she	26
must	26
know	26
how	26
to	26
make	26
it,	26
let	26
it	26
never	26
be	26
out	26
of	26
her	26
hands;	26
for	26
when	26
she	26
is	26
occupied	26
in	26
shifting	26
the	26
bobbins	26
to	26
and	26
fro,	26
the	26
image	26
or	26
images	26
of	26
what	26
she	26
loves	26
will	26
not	26
shift	26
to	26
and	26
fro	26
in	26
her	26
thoughts;	26
this	26
is	26
the	26
truth,	26
this	26
is	26
my	26
opinion,	26
and	26
this	26
is	26
my	26
advice.”	26
“And	26
mine,”	26
added	26
Sancho;	26
“for	26
I	26
never	26
in	26
all	26
my	26
life	26
saw	26
a	26
lace-maker	26
that	26
died	26
for	26
love;	26
when	26
damsels	26
are	26
at	26
work	26
their	26
minds	26
are	26
more	26
set	26
on	26
finishing	26
their	26
tasks	26
than	26
on	26
thinking	26
of	26
their	26
loves.	26
I	26
speak	26
from	26
my	26
own	26
experience;	26
for	26
when	26
I’m	26
digging	26
I	26
never	26
think	26
of	26
my	26
old	26
woman;	26
I	26
mean	26
my	26
Teresa	26
Panza,	26
whom	26
I	26
love	26
better	26
than	26
my	26
own	26
eyelids.”	26
“You	26
say	26
well,	26
Sancho,”	26
said	26
the	26
duchess,	26
“and	26
I	26
will	26
take	26
care	26
that	26
my	26
Altisidora	26
employs	26
herself	26
henceforward	26
in	26
needlework	26
of	26
some	26
sort;	26
for	26
she	26
is	26
extremely	26
expert	26
at	26
it.”	26
“There	26
is	26
no	26
occasion	26
to	26
have	26
recourse	26
to	26
that	26
remedy,	26
señora,”	26
said	26
Altisidora;	26
“for	26
the	26
mere	26
thought	26
of	26
the	26
cruelty	26
with	26
which	26
this	26
vagabond	26
villain	26
has	26
treated	26
me	26
will	26
suffice	26
to	26
blot	26
him	26
out	26
of	26
my	26
memory	26
without	26
any	26
other	26
device;	26
with	26
your	26
highness’s	26
leave	26
I	26
will	26
retire,	26
not	26
to	26
have	26
before	26
my	26
eyes,	26
I	26
won’t	26
say	26
his	26
rueful	26
countenance,	26
but	26
his	26
abominable,	26
ugly	26
looks.”	26
“That	26
reminds	26
me	26
of	26
the	26
common	26
saying,	26
that	26
‘he	26
that	26
rails	26
is	26
ready	26
to	26
forgive,’”	26
said	26
the	26
duke.	26
Altisidora	26
then,	26
pretending	26
to	26
wipe	26
away	26
her	26
tears	26
with	26
a	26
handkerchief,	26
made	26
an	26
obeisance	26
to	26
her	26
master	26
and	26
mistress	26
and	26
quitted	26
the	26
room.	26
“Ill	26
luck	26
betide	26
thee,	26
poor	26
damsel,”	26
said	26
Sancho,	26
“ill	26
luck	26
betide	26
thee!	26
Thou	26
hast	26
fallen	26
in	26
with	26
a	26
soul	26
as	26
dry	26
as	26
a	26
rush	26
and	26
a	26
heart	26
as	26
hard	26
as	26
oak;	26
had	26
it	26
been	26
me,	26
i’faith	26
‘another	26
cock	26
would	26
have	26
crowed	26
to	26
thee.’”	26
So	26
the	26
conversation	26
came	26
to	26
an	26
end,	26
and	26
Don	26
Quixote	26
dressed	26
himself	26
and	26
dined	26
with	26
the	26
duke	26
and	26
duchess,	26
and	26
set	26
out	26
the	26
same	26
evening.	26

LXXI.	26
OF	26
WHAT	26
PASSED	26
BETWEEN	26

QUIXOTE	26
AND	26
HIS	26
SQUIRE	26

Size	26
The	26
vanquished	26
and	26
afflicted	26
Don	26
Quixote	26
went	26
along	26
very	26
downcast	26
in	26
one	26
respect	26
and	26
very	26
happy	26
in	26
another.	26
His	26
sadness	26
arose	26
from	26
his	26
defeat,	26
and	26
his	26
satisfaction	26
from	26
the	26
thought	26
of	26
the	26
virtue	26
that	26
lay	26
in	26
Sancho,	26
as	26
had	26
been	26
proved	26
by	26
the	26
resurrection	26
of	26
Altisidora;	26
though	26
it	26
was	26
with	26
difficulty	26
he	26
could	26
persuade	26
himself	26
that	26
the	26
love-smitten	26
damsel	26
had	26
been	26
really	26
dead.	26
Sancho	26
went	26
along	26
anything	26
but	26
cheerful,	26
for	26
it	26
grieved	26
him	26
that	26
Altisidora	26
had	26
not	26
kept	26
her	26
promise	26
of	26
giving	26
him	26
the	26
smocks;	26
and	26
turning	26
this	26
over	26
in	26
his	26
mind	26
he	26
said	26
to	26
his	26
master,	26
“Surely,	26
señor,	26
I’m	26
the	26
most	26
unlucky	26
doctor	26
in	26
the	26
world;	26
there’s	26
many	26
a	26
physician	26
that,	26
after	26
killing	26
the	26
sick	26
man	26
he	26
had	26
to	26
cure,	26
requires	26
to	26
be	26
paid	26
for	26
his	26
work,	26
though	26
it	26
is	26
only	26
signing	26
a	26
bit	26
of	26
a	26
list	26
of	26
medicines,	26
that	26
the	26
apothecary	26
and	26
not	26
he	26
makes	26
up,	26
and,	26
there,	26
his	26
labour	26
is	26
over;	26
but	26
with	26
me	26
though	26
to	26
cure	26
somebody	26
else	26
costs	26
me	26
drops	26
of	26
blood,	26
smacks,	26
pinches,	26
pinproddings,	26
and	26
whippings,	26
nobody	26
gives	26
me	26
a	26
farthing.	26
Well,	26
I	26
swear	26
by	26
all	26
that’s	26
good	26
if	26
they	26
put	26
another	26
patient	26
into	26
my	26
hands,	26
they’ll	26
have	26
to	26
grease	26
them	26
for	26
me	26
before	26
I	26
cure	26
him;	26
for,	26
as	26
they	26
say,	26
‘it’s	26
by	26
his	26
singing	26
the	26
abbot	26
gets	26
his	26
dinner,’	26
and	26
I’m	26
not	26
going	26
to	26
believe	26
that	26
heaven	26
has	26
bestowed	26
upon	26
me	26
the	26
virtue	26
I	26
have,	26
that	26
I	26
should	26
be	26
dealing	26
it	26
out	26
to	26
others	26
all	26
for	26
nothing.”	26
“Thou	26
art	26
right,	26
Sancho	26
my	26
friend,”	26
said	26
Don	26
Quixote,	26
“and	26
Altisidora	26
has	26
behaved	26
very	26
badly	26
in	26
not	26
giving	26
thee	26
the	26
smocks	26
she	26
promised;	26
and	26
although	26
that	26
virtue	26
of	26
thine	26
is	26
_gratis	26
data_—as	26
it	26
has	26
cost	26
thee	26
no	26
study	26
whatever,	26
any	26
more	26
than	26
such	26
study	26
as	26
thy	26
personal	26
sufferings	26
may	26
be—I	26
can	26
say	26
for	26
myself	26
that	26
if	26
thou	26
wouldst	26
have	26
payment	26
for	26
the	26
lashes	26
on	26
account	26
of	26
the	26
disenchant	26
of	26
Dulcinea,	26
I	26
would	26
have	26
given	26
it	26
to	26
thee	26
freely	26
ere	26
this.	26
I	26
am	26
not	26
sure,	26
however,	26
whether	26
payment	26
will	26
comport	26
with	26
the	26
cure,	26
and	26
I	26
would	26
not	26
have	26
the	26
reward	26
interfere	26
with	26
the	26
medicine.	26
I	26
think	26
there	26
will	26
be	26
nothing	26
lost	26
by	26
trying	26
it;	26
consider	26
how	26
much	26
thou	26
wouldst	26
have,	26
Sancho,	26
and	26
whip	26
thyself	26
at	26
once,	26
and	26
pay	26
thyself	26
down	26
with	26
thine	26
own	26
hand,	26
as	26
thou	26
hast	26
money	26
of	26
mine.”	26
At	26
this	26
proposal	26
Sancho	26
opened	26
his	26
eyes	26
and	26
his	26
ears	26
a	26
palm’s	26
breadth	26
wide,	26
and	26
in	26
his	26
heart	26
very	26
readily	26
acquiesced	26
in	26
whipping	26
himself,	26
and	26
said	26
he	26
to	26
his	26
master,	26
“Very	26
well	26
then,	26
señor,	26
I’ll	26
hold	26
myself	26
in	26
readiness	26
to	26
gratify	26
your	26
worship’s	26
wishes	26
if	26
I’m	26
to	26
profit	26
by	26
it;	26
for	26
the	26
love	26
of	26
my	26
wife	26
and	26
children	26
forces	26
me	26
to	26
seem	26
grasping.	26
Let	26
your	26
worship	26
say	26
how	26
much	26
you	26
will	26
pay	26
me	26
for	26
each	26
lash	26
I	26
give	26
myself.”	26
“If	26
Sancho,”	26
replied	26
Don	26
Quixote,	26
“I	26
were	26
to	26
requite	26
thee	26
as	26
the	26
importance	26
and	26
nature	26
of	26
the	26
cure	26
deserves,	26
the	26
treasures	26
of	26
Venice,	26
the	26
mines	26
of	26
Potosi,	26
would	26
be	26
insufficient	26
to	26
pay	26
thee.	26
See	26
what	26
thou	26
hast	26
of	26
mine,	26
and	26
put	26
a	26
price	26
on	26
each	26
lash.”	26
“Of	26
them,”	26
said	26
Sancho,	26
“there	26
are	26
three	26
thousand	26
three	26
hundred	26
and	26
odd;	26
of	26
these	26
I	26
have	26
given	26
myself	26
five,	26
the	26
rest	26
remain;	26
let	26
the	26
five	26
go	26
for	26
the	26
odd	26
ones,	26
and	26
let	26
us	26
take	26
the	26
three	26
thousand	26
three	26
hundred,	26
which	26
at	26
a	26
quarter	26
real	26
apiece	26
(for	26
I	26
will	26
not	26
take	26
less	26
though	26
the	26
whole	26
world	26
should	26
bid	26
me)	26
make	26
three	26
thousand	26
three	26
hundred	26
quarter	26
reals;	26
the	26
three	26
thousand	26
are	26
one	26
thousand	26
five	26
hundred	26
half	26
reals,	26
which	26
make	26
seven	26
hundred	26
and	26
fifty	26
reals;	26
and	26
the	26
three	26
hundred	26
make	26
a	26
hundred	26
and	26
fifty	26
half	26
reals,	26
which	26
come	26
to	26
seventy-five	26
reals,	26
which	26
added	26
to	26
the	26
seven	26
hundred	26
and	26
fifty	26
make	26
eight	26
hundred	26
and	26
twenty-five	26
reals	26
in	26
all.	26
These	26
I	26
will	26
stop	26
out	26
of	26
what	26
I	26
have	26
belonging	26
to	26
your	26
worship,	26
and	26
I’ll	26
return	26
home	26
rich	26
and	26
content,	26
though	26
well	26
whipped,	26
for	26
‘there’s	26
no	26
taking	26
trout’—but	26
I	26
say	26
no	26
more.”	26
“O	26
blessed	26
Sancho!	26
O	26
dear	26
Sancho!”	26
said	26
Don	26
Quixote;	26
“how	26
we	26
shall	26
be	26
bound	26
to	26
serve	26
thee,	26
Dulcinea	26
and	26
I,	26
all	26
the	26
days	26
of	26
our	26
lives	26
that	26
heaven	26
may	26
grant	26
us!	26
If	26
she	26
returns	26
to	26
her	26
lost	26
shape	26
(and	26
it	26
cannot	26
be	26
but	26
that	26
she	26
will)	26
her	26
misfortune	26
will	26
have	26
been	26
good	26
fortune,	26
and	26
my	26
defeat	26
a	26
most	26
happy	26
triumph.	26
But	26
look	26
here,	26
Sancho;	26
when	26
wilt	26
thou	26
begin	26
the	26
scourging?	26
For	26
if	26
thou	26
wilt	26
make	26
short	26
work	26
of	26
it,	26
I	26
will	26
give	26
thee	26
a	26
hundred	26
reals	26
over	26
and	26
above.”	26
“When?”	26
said	26
Sancho;	26
“this	26
night	26
without	26
fail.	26
Let	26
your	26
worship	26
order	26
it	26
so	26
that	26
we	26
pass	26
it	26
out	26
of	26
doors	26
and	26
in	26
the	26
open	26
air,	26
and	26
I’ll	26
scarify	26
myself.”	26
Night,	26
longed	26
for	26
by	26
Don	26
Quixote	26
with	26
the	26
greatest	26
anxiety	26
in	26
the	26
world,	26
came	26
at	26
last,	26
though	26
it	26
seemed	26
to	26
him	26
that	26
the	26
wheels	26
of	26
Apollo’s	26
car	26
had	26
broken	26
down,	26
and	26
that	26
the	26
day	26
was	26
drawing	26
itself	26
out	26
longer	26
than	26
usual,	26
just	26
as	26
is	26
the	26
case	26
with	26
lovers,	26
who	26
never	26
make	26
the	26
reckoning	26
of	26
their	26
desires	26
agree	26
with	26
time.	26
They	26
made	26
their	26
way	26
at	26
length	26
in	26
among	26
some	26
pleasant	26
trees	26
that	26
stood	26
a	26
little	26
distance	26
from	26
the	26
road,	26
and	26
there	26
vacating	26
Rocinante’s	26
saddle	26
and	26
Dapple’s	26
pack-saddle,	26
they	26
stretched	26
themselves	26
on	26
the	26
green	26
grass	26
and	26
made	26
their	26
supper	26
off	26
Sancho’s	26
stores,	26
and	26
he	26
making	26
a	26
powerful	26
and	26
flexible	26
whip	26
out	26
of	26
Dapple’s	26
halter	26
and	26
headstall	26
retreated	26
about	26
twenty	26
paces	26
from	26
his	26
master	26
among	26
some	26
beech	26
trees.	26
Don	26
Quixote	26
seeing	26
him	26
march	26
off	26
with	26
such	26
resolution	26
and	26
spirit,	26
said	26
to	26
him,	26
“Take	26
care,	26
my	26
friend,	26
not	26
to	26
cut	26
thyself	26
to	26
pieces;	26
allow	26
the	26
lashes	26
to	26
wait	26
for	26
one	26
another,	26
and	26
do	26
not	26
be	26
in	26
so	26
great	26
a	26
hurry	26
as	26
to	26
run	26
thyself	26
out	26
of	26
breath	26
midway;	26
I	26
mean,	26
do	26
not	26
lay	26
on	26
so	26
strenuously	26
as	26
to	26
make	26
thy	26
life	26
fail	26
thee	26
before	26
thou	26
hast	26
reached	26
the	26
desired	26
number;	26
and	26
that	26
thou	26
mayest	26
not	26
lose	26
by	26
a	26
card	26
too	26
much	26
or	26
too	26
little,	26
I	26
will	26
station	26
myself	26
apart	26
and	26
count	26
on	26
my	26
rosary	26
here	26
the	26
lashes	26
thou	26
givest	26
thyself.	26
May	26
heaven	26
help	26
thee	26
as	26
thy	26
good	26
intention	26
deserves.”	26
“‘Pledges	26
don’t	26
distress	26
a	26
good	26
payer,’”	26
said	26
Sancho;	26
“I	26
mean	26
to	26
lay	26
on	26
in	26
such	26
a	26
way	26
as	26
without	26
killing	26
myself	26
to	26
hurt	26
myself,	26
for	26
in	26
that,	26
no	26
doubt,	26
lies	26
the	26
essence	26
of	26
this	26
miracle.”	26
He	26
then	26
stripped	26
himself	26
from	26
the	26
waist	26
upwards,	26
and	26
snatching	26
up	26
the	26
rope	26
he	26
began	26
to	26
lay	26
on	26
and	26
Don	26
Quixote	26
to	26
count	26
the	26
lashes.	26
He	26
might	26
have	26
given	26
himself	26
six	26
or	26
eight	26
when	26
he	26
began	26
to	26
think	26
the	26
joke	26
no	26
trifle,	26
and	26
its	26
price	26
very	26
low;	26
and	26
holding	26
his	26
hand	26
for	26
a	26
moment,	26
he	26
told	26
his	26
master	26
that	26
he	26
cried	26
off	26
on	26
the	26
score	26
of	26
a	26
blind	26
bargain,	26
for	26
each	26
of	26
those	26
lashes	26
ought	26
to	26
be	26
paid	26
for	26
at	26
the	26
rate	26
of	26
half	26
a	26
real	26
instead	26
of	26
a	26
quarter.	26
“Go	26
on,	26
Sancho	26
my	26
friend,	26
and	26
be	26
not	26
disheartened,”	26
said	26
Don	26
Quixote;	26
“for	26
I	26
double	26
the	26
stakes	26
as	26
to	26
price.”	26
“In	26
that	26
case,”	26
said	26
Sancho,	26
“in	26
God’s	26
hand	26
be	26
it,	26
and	26
let	26
it	26
rain	26
lashes.”	26
But	26
the	26
rogue	26
no	26
longer	26
laid	26
them	26
on	26
his	26
shoulders,	26
but	26
laid	26
on	26
to	26
the	26
trees,	26
with	26
such	26
groans	26
every	26
now	26
and	26
then,	26
that	26
one	26
would	26
have	26
thought	26
at	26
each	26
of	26
them	26
his	26
soul	26
was	26
being	26
plucked	26
up	26
by	26
the	26
roots.	26
Don	26
Quixote,	26
touched	26
to	26
the	26
heart,	26
and	26
fearing	26
he	26
might	26
make	26
an	26
end	26
of	26
himself,	26
and	26
that	26
through	26
Sancho’s	26
imprudence	26
he	26
might	26
miss	26
his	26
own	26
object,	26
said	26
to	26
him,	26
“As	26
thou	26
livest,	26
my	26
friend,	26
let	26
the	26
matter	26
rest	26
where	26
it	26
is,	26
for	26
the	26
remedy	26
seems	26
to	26
me	26
a	26
very	26
rough	26
one,	26
and	26
it	26
will	26
be	26
well	26
to	26
have	26
patience;	26
‘Zamora	26
was	26
not	26
won	26
in	26
an	26
hour.’	26
If	26
I	26
have	26
not	26
reckoned	26
wrong	26
thou	26
hast	26
given	26
thyself	26
over	26
a	26
thousand	26
lashes;	26
that	26
is	26
enough	26
for	26
the	26
present;	26
‘for	26
the	26
ass,’	26
to	26
put	26
it	26
in	26
homely	26
phrase,	26
‘bears	26
the	26
load,	26
but	26
not	26
the	26
overload.’”	26
“No,	26
no,	26
señor,”	26
replied	26
Sancho;	26
“it	26
shall	26
never	26
be	26
said	26
of	26
me,	26
‘The	26
money	26
paid,	26
the	26
arms	26
broken;’	26
go	26
back	26
a	26
little	26
further,	26
your	26
worship,	26
and	26
let	26
me	26
give	26
myself	26
at	26
any	26
rate	26
a	26
thousand	26
lashes	26
more;	26
for	26
in	26
a	26
couple	26
of	26
bouts	26
like	26
this	26
we	26
shall	26
have	26
finished	26
off	26
the	26
lot,	26
and	26
there	26
will	26
be	26
even	26
cloth	26
to	26
spare.”	26
“As	26
thou	26
art	26
in	26
such	26
a	26
willing	26
mood,”	26
said	26
Don	26
Quixote,	26
“may	26
heaven	26
aid	26
thee;	26
lay	26
on	26
and	26
I’ll	26
retire.”	26
Sancho	26
returned	26
to	26
his	26
task	26
with	26
so	26
much	26
resolution	26
that	26
he	26
soon	26
had	26
the	26
bark	26
stripped	26
off	26
several	26
trees,	26
such	26
was	26
the	26
severity	26
with	26
which	26
he	26
whipped	26
himself;	26
and	26
one	26
time,	26
raising	26
his	26
voice,	26
and	26
giving	26
a	26
beech	26
a	26
tremendous	26
lash,	26
he	26
cried	26
out,	26
“Here	26
dies	26
Samson,	26
and	26
all	26
with	26
him!”	26

At	26
the	26
sound	26
of	26
his	26
piteous	26
cry	26
and	26
of	26
the	26
stroke	26
of	26
the	26
cruel	26
lash,	26
Don	26
Quixote	26
ran	26
to	26
him	26
at	26
once,	26
and	26
seizing	26
the	26
twisted	26
halter	26
that	26
served	26
him	26
for	26
a	26
courbash,	26
said	26
to	26
him,	26
“Heaven	26
forbid,	26
Sancho	26
my	26
friend,	26
that	26
to	26
please	26
me	26
thou	26
shouldst	26
lose	26
thy	26
life,	26
which	26
is	26
needed	26
for	26
the	26
support	26
of	26
thy	26
wife	26
and	26
children;	26
let	26
Dulcinea	26
wait	26
for	26
a	26
better	26
opportunity,	26
and	26
I	26
will	26
content	26
myself	26
with	26
a	26
hope	26
soon	26
to	26
be	26
realised,	26
and	26
have	26
patience	26
until	26
thou	26
hast	26
gained	26
fresh	26
strength	26
so	26
as	26
to	26
finish	26
off	26
this	26
business	26
to	26
the	26
satisfaction	26
of	26
everybody.”	26
“As	26
your	26
worship	26
will	26
have	26
it	26
so,	26
señor,”	26
said	26
Sancho,	26
“so	26
be	26
it;	26
but	26
throw	26
your	26
cloak	26
over	26
my	26
shoulders,	26
for	26
I’m	26
sweating	26
and	26
I	26
don’t	26
want	26
to	26
take	26
cold;	26
it’s	26
a	26
risk	26
that	26
novice	26
disciplinants	26
run.”	26
Don	26
Quixote	26
obeyed,	26
and	26
stripping	26
himself	26
covered	26
Sancho,	26
who	26
slept	26
until	26
the	26
sun	26
woke	26
him;	26
they	26
then	26
resumed	26
their	26
journey,	26
which	26
for	26
the	26
time	26
being	26
they	26
brought	26
to	26
an	26
end	26
at	26
a	26
village	26
that	26
lay	26
three	26
leagues	26
farther	26
on.	26
They	26
dismounted	26
at	26
a	26
hostelry	26
which	26
Don	26
Quixote	26
recognised	26
as	26
such	26
and	26
did	26
not	26
take	26
to	26
be	26
a	26
castle	26
with	26
moat,	26
turrets,	26
portcullis,	26
and	26
drawbridge;	26
for	26
ever	26
since	26
he	26
had	26
been	26
vanquished	26
he	26
talked	26
more	26
rationally	26
about	26
everything,	26
as	26
will	26
be	26
shown	26
presently.	26
They	26
quartered	26
him	26
in	26
a	26
room	26
on	26
the	26
ground	26
floor,	26
where	26
in	26
place	26
of	26
leather	26
hangings	26
there	26
were	26
pieces	26
of	26
painted	26
serge	26
such	26
as	26
they	26
commonly	26
use	26
in	26
villages.	26
On	26
one	26
of	26
them	26
was	26
painted	26
by	26
some	26
very	26
poor	26
hand	26
the	26
Rape	26
of	26
Helen,	26
when	26
the	26
bold	26
guest	26
carried	26
her	26
off	26
from	26
Menelaus,	26
and	26
on	26
the	26
other	26
was	26
the	26
story	26
of	26
Dido	26
and	26
Æneas,	26
she	26
on	26
a	26
high	26
tower,	26
as	26
though	26
she	26
were	26
making	26
signals	26
with	26
a	26
half	26
sheet	26
to	26
her	26
fugitive	26
guest	26
who	26
was	26
out	26
at	26
sea	26
flying	26
in	26
a	26
frigate	26
or	26
brigantine.	26
He	26
noticed	26
in	26
the	26
two	26
stories	26
that	26
Helen	26
did	26
not	26
go	26
very	26
reluctantly,	26
for	26
she	26
was	26
laughing	26
slyly	26
and	26
roguishly;	26
but	26
the	26
fair	26
Dido	26
was	26
shown	26
dropping	26
tears	26
the	26
size	26
of	26
walnuts	26
from	26
her	26
eyes.	26
Don	26
Quixote	26
as	26
he	26
looked	26
at	26
them	26
observed,	26
“Those	26
two	26
ladies	26
were	26
very	26
unfortunate	26
not	26
to	26
have	26
been	26
born	26
in	26
this	26
age,	26
and	26
I	26
unfortunate	26
above	26
all	26
men	26
not	26
to	26
have	26
been	26
born	26
in	26
theirs.	26
Had	26
I	26
fallen	26
in	26
with	26
those	26
gentlemen,	26
Troy	26
would	26
not	26
have	26
been	26
burned	26
or	26
Carthage	26
destroyed,	26
for	26
it	26
would	26
have	26
been	26
only	26
for	26
me	26
to	26
slay	26
Paris,	26
and	26
all	26
these	26
misfortunes	26
would	26
have	26
been	26
avoided.”	26
“I’ll	26
lay	26
a	26
bet,”	26
said	26
Sancho,	26
“that	26
before	26
long	26
there	26
won’t	26
be	26
a	26
tavern,	26
roadside	26
inn,	26
hostelry,	26
or	26
barber’s	26
shop	26
where	26
the	26
story	26
of	26
our	26
doings	26
won’t	26
be	26
painted	26
up;	26
but	26
I’d	26
like	26
it	26
painted	26
by	26
the	26
hand	26
of	26
a	26
better	26
painter	26
than	26
painted	26
these.”	26
“Thou	26
art	26
right,	26
Sancho,”	26
said	26
Don	26
Quixote,	26
“for	26
this	26
painter	26
is	26
like	26
Orbaneja,	26
a	26
painter	26
there	26
was	26
at	26
Úbeda,	26
who	26
when	26
they	26
asked	26
him	26
what	26
he	26
was	26
painting,	26
used	26
to	26
say,	26
‘Whatever	26
it	26
may	26
turn	26
out;	26
and	26
if	26
he	26
chanced	26
to	26
paint	26
a	26
cock	26
he	26
would	26
write	26
under	26
it,	26
‘This	26
is	26
a	26
cock,’	26
for	26
fear	26
they	26
might	26
think	26
it	26
was	26
a	26
fox.	26
The	26
painter	26
or	26
writer,	26
for	26
it’s	26
all	26
the	26
same,	26
who	26
published	26
the	26
history	26
of	26
this	26
new	26
Don	26
Quixote	26
that	26
has	26
come	26
out,	26
must	26
have	26
been	26
one	26
of	26
this	26
sort	26
I	26
think,	26
Sancho,	26
for	26
he	26
painted	26
or	26
wrote	26
‘whatever	26
it	26
might	26
turn	26
out;’	26
or	26
perhaps	26
he	26
is	26
like	26
a	26
poet	26
called	26
Mauleon	26
that	26
was	26
about	26
the	26
Court	26
some	26
years	26
ago,	26
who	26
used	26
to	26
answer	26
at	26
haphazard	26
whatever	26
he	26
was	26
asked,	26
and	26
on	26
one	26
asking	26
him	26
what	26
_Deum	26
de	26
Deo_	26
meant,	26
he	26
replied	26
_Dé	26
donde	26
diere_.	26
But,	26
putting	26
this	26
aside,	26
tell	26
me,	26
Sancho,	26
hast	26
thou	26
a	26
mind	26
to	26
have	26
another	26
turn	26
at	26
thyself	26
to-night,	26
and	26
wouldst	26
thou	26
rather	26
have	26
it	26
indoors	26
or	26
in	26
the	26
open	26
air?”	26
“Egad,	26
señor,”	26
said	26
Sancho,	26
“for	26
what	26
I’m	26
going	26
to	26
give	26
myself,	26
it	26
comes	26
all	26
the	26
same	26
to	26
me	26
whether	26
it	26
is	26
in	26
a	26
house	26
or	26
in	26
the	26
fields;	26
still	26
I’d	26
like	26
it	26
to	26
be	26
among	26
trees;	26
for	26
I	26
think	26
they	26
are	26
company	26
for	26
me	26
and	26
help	26
me	26
to	26
bear	26
my	26
pain	26
wonderfully.”	26
“And	26
yet	26
it	26
must	26
not	26
be,	26
Sancho	26
my	26
friend,”	26
said	26
Don	26
Quixote;	26
“but,	26
to	26
enable	26
thee	26
to	26
recover	26
strength,	26
we	26
must	26
keep	26
it	26
for	26
our	26
own	26
village;	26
for	26
at	26
the	26
latest	26
we	26
shall	26
get	26
there	26
the	26
day	26
after	26
to-morrow.”	26
Sancho	26
said	26
he	26
might	26
do	26
as	26
he	26
pleased;	26
but	26
that	26
for	26
his	26
own	26
part	26
he	26
would	26
like	26
to	26
finish	26
off	26
the	26
business	26
quickly	26
before	26
his	26
blood	26
cooled	26
and	26
while	26
he	26
had	26
an	26
appetite,	26
because	26
“in	26
delay	26
there	26
is	26
apt	26
to	26
be	26
danger”	26
very	26
often,	26
and	26
“praying	26
to	26
God	26
and	26
plying	26
the	26
hammer,”	26
and	26
“one	26
take	26
was	26
better	26
than	26
two	26
I’ll	26
give	26
thee’s,”	26
and	26
“a	26
sparrow	26
in	26
the	26
hand	26
than	26
a	26
vulture	26
on	26
the	26
wing.”	26
“For	26
God’s	26
sake,	26
Sancho,	26
no	26
more	26
proverbs!”	26
exclaimed	26
Don	26
Quixote;	26
“it	26
seems	26
to	26
me	26
thou	26
art	26
becoming	26
_sicut	26
erat_	26
again;	26
speak	26
in	26
a	26
plain,	26
simple,	26
straight-forward	26
way,	26
as	26
I	26
have	26
often	26
told	26
thee,	26
and	26
thou	26
wilt	26
find	26
the	26
good	26
of	26
it.”	26
“I	26
don’t	26
know	26
what	26
bad	26
luck	26
it	26
is	26
of	26
mine,”	26
said	26
Sancho,	26
“but	26
I	26
can’t	26
utter	26
a	26
word	26
without	26
a	26
proverb	26
that	26
is	26
not	26
as	26
good	26
as	26
an	26
argument	26
to	26
my	26
mind;	26
however,	26
I	26
mean	26
to	26
mend	26
if	26
I	26
can;”	26
and	26
so	26
for	26
the	26
present	26
the	26
conversation	26
ended.	26

All	26
that	26
day	26
Don	26
Quixote	26
and	26
Sancho	26
remained	26
in	26
the	26
village	26
and	26
inn	26
waiting	26
for	26
night,	26
the	26
one	26
to	26
finish	26
off	26
his	26
task	26
of	26
scourging	26
in	26
the	26
open	26
country,	26
the	26
other	26
to	26
see	26
it	26
accomplished,	26
for	26
therein	26
lay	26
the	26
accomplishment	26
of	26
his	26
wishes.	26
Meanwhile	26
there	26
arrived	26
at	26
the	26
hostelry	26
a	26
traveller	26
on	26
horseback	26
with	26
three	26
or	26
four	26
servants,	26
one	26
of	26
whom	26
said	26
to	26
him	26
who	26
appeared	26
to	26
be	26
the	26
master,	26
“Here,	26
Señor	26
Don	26
Álvaro	26
Tarfe,	26
your	26
worship	26
may	26
take	26
your	26
siesta	26
to-day;	26
the	26
quarters	26
seem	26
clean	26
and	26
cool.”	26
When	26
he	26
heard	26
this	26
Don	26
Quixote	26
said	26
to	26
Sancho,	26
“Look	26
here,	26
Sancho;	26
on	26
turning	26
over	26
the	26
leaves	26
of	26
that	26
book	26
of	26
the	26
Second	26
Part	26
of	26
my	26
history	26
I	26
think	26
I	26
came	26
casually	26
upon	26
this	26
name	26
of	26
Don	26
Álvaro	26
Tarfe.”	26
“Very	26
likely,”	26
said	26
Sancho;	26
“we	26
had	26
better	26
let	26
him	26
dismount,	26
and	26
by-and-by	26
we	26
can	26
ask	26
about	26
it.”	26
The	26
gentleman	26
dismounted,	26
and	26
the	26
landlady	26
gave	26
him	26
a	26
room	26
on	26
the	26
ground	26
floor	26
opposite	26
Don	26
Quixote’s	26
and	26
adorned	26
with	26
painted	26
serge	26
hangings	26
of	26
the	26
same	26
sort.	26
The	26
newly	26
arrived	26
gentleman	26
put	26
on	26
a	26
summer	26
coat,	26
and	26
coming	26
out	26
to	26
the	26
gateway	26
of	26
the	26
hostelry,	26
which	26
was	26
wide	26
and	26
cool,	26
addressing	26
Don	26
Quixote,	26
who	26
was	26
pacing	26
up	26
and	26
down	26
there,	26
he	26
asked,	26
“In	26
what	26
direction	26
is	26
your	26
worship	26
bound,	26
gentle	26
sir?”	26
“To	26
a	26
village	26
near	26
this	26
which	26
is	26
my	26
own	26
village,”	26
replied	26
Don	26
Quixote;	26
“and	26
your	26
worship,	26
where	26
are	26
you	26
bound	26
for?”	26
“I	26
am	26
going	26
to	26
Granada,	26
señor,”	26
said	26
the	26
gentleman,	26
“to	26
my	26
own	26
country.”	26
“And	26
a	26
goodly	26
country,”	26
said	26
Don	26
Quixote;	26
“but	26
will	26
your	26
worship	26
do	26
me	26
the	26
favour	26
of	26
telling	26
me	26
your	26
name,	26
for	26
it	26
strikes	26
me	26
it	26
is	26
of	26
more	26
importance	26
to	26
me	26
to	26
know	26
it	26
than	26
I	26
can	26
tell	26
you.”	26
“My	26
name	26
is	26
Don	26
Álvaro	26
Tarfe,”	26
replied	26
the	26
traveller.	26
To	26
which	26
Don	26
Quixote	26
returned,	26
“I	26
have	26
no	26
doubt	26
whatever	26
that	26
your	26
worship	26
is	26
that	26
Don	26
Álvaro	26
Tarfe	26
who	26
appears	26
in	26
print	26
in	26
the	26
Second	26
Part	26
of	26
the	26
history	26
of	26
Don	26
Quixote	26
of	26
La	26
Mancha,	26
lately	26
printed	26
and	26
published	26
by	26
a	26
new	26
author.”	26
“I	26
am	26
the	26
same,”	26
replied	26
the	26
gentleman;	26
“and	26
that	26
same	26
Don	26
Quixote,	26
the	26
principal	26
personage	26
in	26
the	26
said	26
history,	26
was	26
a	26
very	26
great	26
friend	26
of	26
mine,	26
and	26
it	26
was	26
I	26
who	26
took	26
him	26
away	26
from	26
home,	26
or	26
at	26
least	26
induced	26
him	26
to	26
come	26
to	26
some	26
jousts	26
that	26
were	26
to	26
be	26
held	26
at	26
Saragossa,	26
whither	26
I	26
was	26
going	26
myself;	26
indeed,	26
I	26
showed	26
him	26
many	26
kindnesses,	26
and	26
saved	26
him	26
from	26
having	26
his	26
shoulders	26
touched	26
up	26
by	26
the	26
executioner	26
because	26
of	26
his	26
extreme	26
rashness.”	26
“Tell	26
me,	26
Señor	26
Don	26
Álvaro,”	26
said	26
Don	26
Quixote,	26
“am	26
I	26
at	26
all	26
like	26
that	26
Don	26
Quixote	26
you	26
talk	26
of?”	26
“No	26
indeed,”	26
replied	26
the	26
traveller,	26
“not	26
a	26
bit.”	26
“And	26
that	26
Don	26
Quixote—”	26
said	26
our	26
one,	26
“had	26
he	26
with	26
him	26
a	26
squire	26
called	26
Sancho	26
Panza?”	26
“He	26
had,”	26
said	26
Don	26
Álvaro;	26
“but	26
though	26
he	26
had	26
the	26
name	26
of	26
being	26
very	26
droll,	26
I	26
never	26
heard	26
him	26
say	26
anything	26
that	26
had	26
any	26
drollery	26
in	26
it.”	26
“That	26
I	26
can	26
well	26
believe,”	26
said	26
Sancho	26
at	26
this,	26
“for	26
to	26
come	26
out	26
with	26
drolleries	26
is	26
not	26
in	26
everybody’s	26
line;	26
and	26
that	26
Sancho	26
your	26
worship	26
speaks	26
of,	26
gentle	26
sir,	26
must	26
be	26
some	26
great	26
scoundrel,	26
dunderhead,	26
and	26
thief,	26
all	26
in	26
one;	26
for	26
I	26
am	26
the	26
real	26
Sancho	26
Panza,	26
and	26
I	26
have	26
more	26
drolleries	26
than	26
if	26
it	26
rained	26
them;	26
let	26
your	26
worship	26
only	26
try;	26
come	26
along	26
with	26
me	26
for	26
a	26
year	26
or	26
so,	26
and	26
you	26
will	26
find	26
they	26
fall	26
from	26
me	26
at	26
every	26
turn,	26
and	26
so	26
rich	26
and	26
so	26
plentiful	26
that	26
though	26
mostly	26
I	26
don’t	26
know	26
what	26
I	26
am	26
saying	26
I	26
make	26
everybody	26
that	26
hears	26
me	26
laugh.	26
And	26
the	26
real	26
Don	26
Quixote	26
of	26
La	26
Mancha,	26
the	26
famous,	26
the	26
valiant,	26
the	26
wise,	26
the	26
lover,	26
the	26
righter	26
of	26
wrongs,	26
the	26
guardian	26
of	26
minors	26
and	26
orphans,	26
the	26
protector	26
of	26
widows,	26
the	26
killer	26
of	26
damsels,	26
he	26
who	26
has	26
for	26
his	26
sole	26
mistress	26
the	26
peerless	26
Dulcinea	26
del	26
Toboso,	26
is	26
this	26
gentleman	26
before	26
you,	26
my	26
master;	26
all	26
other	26
Don	26
Quixotes	26
and	26
all	26
other	26
Sancho	26
Panzas	26
are	26
dreams	26
and	26
mockeries.”	26
“By	26
God	26
I	26
believe	26
it,”	26
said	26
Don	26
Álvaro;	26
“for	26
you	26
have	26
uttered	26
more	26
drolleries,	26
my	26
friend,	26
in	26
the	26
few	26
words	26
you	26
have	26
spoken	26
than	26
the	26
other	26
Sancho	26
Panza	26
in	26
all	26
I	26
ever	26
heard	26
from	26
him,	26
and	26
they	26
were	26
not	26
a	26
few.	26
He	26
was	26
more	26
greedy	26
than	26
well-spoken,	26
and	26
more	26
dull	26
than	26
droll;	26
and	26
I	26
am	26
convinced	26
that	26
the	26
enchanters	26
who	26
persecute	26
Don	26
Quixote	26
the	26
Good	26
have	26
been	26
trying	26
to	26
persecute	26
me	26
with	26
Don	26
Quixote	26
the	26
Bad.	26
But	26
I	26
don’t	26
know	26
what	26
to	26
say,	26
for	26
I	26
am	26
ready	26
to	26
swear	26
I	26
left	26
him	26
shut	26
up	26
in	26
the	26
Casa	26
del	26
Nuncio	26
at	26
Toledo,	26
and	26
here	26
another	26
Don	26
Quixote	26
turns	26
up,	26
though	26
a	26
very	26
different	26
one	26
from	26
mine.”	26
“I	26
don’t	26
know	26
whether	26
I	26
am	26
good,”	26
said	26
Don	26
Quixote,	26
“but	26
I	26
can	26
safely	26
say	26
I	26
am	26
not	26
‘the	26
Bad;’	26
and	26
to	26
prove	26
it,	26
let	26
me	26
tell	26
you,	26
Señor	26
Don	26
Álvaro	26
Tarfe,	26
I	26
have	26
never	26
in	26
my	26
life	26
been	26
in	26
Saragossa;	26
so	26
far	26
from	26
that,	26
when	26
it	26
was	26
told	26
me	26
that	26
this	26
imaginary	26
Don	26
Quixote	26
had	26
been	26
present	26
at	26
the	26
jousts	26
in	26
that	26
city,	26
I	26
declined	26
to	26
enter	26
it,	26
in	26
order	26
to	26
drag	26
his	26
falsehood	26
before	26
the	26
face	26
of	26
the	26
world;	26
and	26
so	26
I	26
went	26
on	26
straight	26
to	26
Barcelona,	26
the	26
treasure-house	26
of	26
courtesy,	26
haven	26
of	26
strangers,	26
asylum	26
of	26
the	26
poor,	26
home	26
of	26
the	26
valiant,	26
champion	26
of	26
the	26
wronged,	26
pleasant	26
exchange	26
of	26
firm	26
friendships,	26
and	26
city	26
unrivalled	26
in	26
site	26
and	26
beauty.	26
And	26
though	26
the	26
adventures	26
that	26
befell	26
me	26
there	26
are	26
not	26
by	26
any	26
means	26
matters	26
of	26
enjoyment,	26
but	26
rather	26
of	26
regret,	26
I	26
do	26
not	26
regret	26
them,	26
simply	26
because	26
I	26
have	26
seen	26
it.	26
In	26
a	26
word,	26
Señor	26
Don	26
Álvaro	26
Tarfe,	26
I	26
am	26
Don	26
Quixote	26
of	26
La	26
Mancha,	26
the	26
one	26
that	26
fame	26
speaks	26
of,	26
and	26
not	26
the	26
unlucky	26
one	26
that	26
has	26
attempted	26
to	26
usurp	26
my	26
name	26
and	26
deck	26
himself	26
out	26
in	26
my	26
ideas.	26
I	26
entreat	26
your	26
worship	26
by	26
your	26
devoir	26
as	26
a	26
gentleman	26
to	26
be	26
so	26
good	26
as	26
to	26
make	26
a	26
declaration	26
before	26
the	26
alcalde	26
of	26
this	26
village	26
that	26
you	26
never	26
in	26
all	26
your	26
life	26
saw	26
me	26
until	26
now,	26
and	26
that	26
neither	26
am	26
I	26
the	26
Don	26
Quixote	26
in	26
print	26
in	26
the	26
Second	26
Part,	26
nor	26
this	26
Sancho	26
Panza,	26
my	26
squire,	26
the	26
one	26
your	26
worship	26
knew.”	26
“That	26
I	26
will	26
do	26
most	26
willingly,”	26
replied	26
Don	26
Álvaro;	26
“though	26
it	26
amazes	26
me	26
to	26
find	26
two	26
Don	26
Quixotes	26
and	26
two	26
Sancho	26
Panzas	26
at	26
once,	26
as	26
much	26
alike	26
in	26
name	26
as	26
they	26
differ	26
in	26
demeanour;	26
and	26
again	26
I	26
say	26
and	26
declare	26
that	26
what	26
I	26
saw	26
I	26
cannot	26
have	26
seen,	26
and	26
that	26
what	26
happened	26
me	26
cannot	26
have	26
happened.”	26
“No	26
doubt	26
your	26
worship	26
is	26
enchanted,	26
like	26
my	26
lady	26
Dulcinea	26
del	26
Toboso,”	26
said	26
Sancho;	26
“and	26
would	26
to	26
heaven	26
your	26
disenchantment	26
rested	26
on	26
my	26
giving	26
myself	26
another	26
three	26
thousand	26
and	26
odd	26
lashes	26
like	26
what	26
I’m	26
giving	26
myself	26
for	26
her,	26
for	26
I’d	26
lay	26
them	26
on	26
without	26
looking	26
for	26
anything.”	26
“I	26
don’t	26
understand	26
that	26
about	26
the	26
lashes,”	26
said	26
Don	26
Álvaro.	26
Sancho	26
replied	26
that	26
it	26
was	26
a	26
long	26
story	26
to	26
tell,	26
but	26
he	26
would	26
tell	26
him	26
if	26
they	26
happened	26
to	26
be	26
going	26
the	26
same	26
road.	26
By	26
this	26
dinner-time	26
arrived,	26
and	26
Don	26
Quixote	26
and	26
Don	26
Álvaro	26
dined	26
together.	26
The	26
alcalde	26
of	26
the	26
village	26
came	26
by	26
chance	26
into	26
the	26
inn	26
together	26
with	26
a	26
notary,	26
and	26
Don	26
Quixote	26
laid	26
a	26
petition	26
before	26
him,	26
showing	26
that	26
it	26
was	26
requisite	26
for	26
his	26
rights	26
that	26
Don	26
Álvaro	26
Tarfe,	26
the	26
gentleman	26
there	26
present,	26
should	26
make	26
a	26
declaration	26
before	26
him	26
that	26
he	26
did	26
not	26
know	26
Don	26
Quixote	26
of	26
La	26
Mancha,	26
also	26
there	26
present,	26
and	26
that	26
he	26
was	26
not	26
the	26
one	26
that	26
was	26
in	26
print	26
in	26
a	26
history	26
entitled	26
“Second	26
Part	26
of	26
Don	26
Quixote	26
of	26
La	26
Mancha,	26
by	26
one	26
Avellaneda	26
of	26
Tordesillas.”	26
The	26
alcalde	26
finally	26
put	26
it	26
in	26
legal	26
form,	26
and	26
the	26
declaration	26
was	26
made	26
with	26
all	26
the	26
formalities	26
required	26
in	26
such	26
cases,	26
at	26
which	26
Don	26
Quixote	26
and	26
Sancho	26
were	26
in	26
high	26
delight,	26
as	26
if	26
a	26
declaration	26
of	26
the	26
sort	26
was	26
of	26
any	26
great	26
importance	26
to	26
them,	26
and	26
as	26
if	26
their	26
words	26
and	26
deeds	26
did	26
not	26
plainly	26
show	26
the	26
difference	26
between	26
the	26
two	26
Don	26
Quixotes	26
and	26
the	26
two	26
Sanchos.	26
Many	26
civilities	26
and	26
offers	26
of	26
service	26
were	26
exchanged	26
by	26
Don	26
Álvaro	26
and	26
Don	26
Quixote,	26
in	26
the	26
course	26
of	26
which	26
the	26
great	26
Manchegan	26
displayed	26
such	26
good	26
taste	26
that	26
he	26
disabused	26
Don	26
Álvaro	26
of	26
the	26
error	26
he	26
was	26
under;	26
and	26
he,	26
on	26
his	26
part,	26
felt	26
convinced	26
he	26
must	26
have	26
been	26
enchanted,	26
now	26
that	26
he	26
had	26
been	26
brought	26
in	26
contact	26
with	26
two	26
such	26
opposite	26
Don	26
Quixotes.	26
Evening	26
came,	26
they	26
set	26
out	26
from	26
the	26
village,	26
and	26
after	26
about	26
half	26
a	26
league	26
two	26
roads	26
branched	26
off,	26
one	26
leading	26
to	26
Don	26
Quixote’s	26
village,	26
the	26
other	26
the	26
road	26
Don	26
Álvaro	26
was	26
to	26
follow.	26
In	26
this	26
short	26
interval	26
Don	26
Quixote	26
told	26
him	26
of	26
his	26
unfortunate	26
defeat,	26
and	26
of	26
Dulcinea’s	26
enchantment	26
and	26
the	26
remedy,	26
all	26
which	26
threw	26
Don	26
Álvaro	26
into	26
fresh	26
amazement,	26
and	26
embracing	26
Don	26
Quixote	26
and	26
Sancho,	26
he	26
went	26
his	26
way,	26
and	26
Don	26
Quixote	26
went	26
his.	26
That	26
night	26
he	26
passed	26
among	26
trees	26
again	26
in	26
order	26
to	26
give	26
Sancho	26
an	26
opportunity	26
of	26
working	26
out	26
his	26
penance,	26
which	26
he	26
did	26
in	26
the	26
same	26
fashion	26
as	26
the	26
night	26
before,	26
at	26
the	26
expense	26
of	26
the	26
bark	26
of	26
the	26
beech	26
trees	26
much	26
more	26
than	26
of	26
his	26
back,	26
of	26
which	26
he	26
took	26
such	26
good	26
care	26
that	26
the	26
lashes	26
would	26
not	26
have	26
knocked	26
off	26
a	26
fly	26
had	26
there	26
been	26
one	26
there.	26
The	26
duped	26
Don	26
Quixote	26
did	26
not	26
miss	26
a	26
single	26
stroke	26
of	26
the	26
count,	26
and	26
he	26
found	26
that	26
together	26
with	26
those	26
of	26
the	26
night	26
before	26
they	26
made	26
up	26
three	26
thousand	26
and	26
twenty-nine.	26
The	26
sun	26
apparently	26
had	26
got	26
up	26
early	26
to	26
witness	26
the	26
sacrifice,	26
and	26
with	26
his	26
light	26
they	26
resumed	26
their	26
journey,	26
discussing	26
the	26
deception	26
practised	26
on	26
Don	26
Álvaro,	26
and	26
saying	26
how	26
well	26
done	26
it	26
was	26
to	26
have	26
taken	26
his	26
declaration	26
before	26
a	26
magistrate	26
in	26
such	26
an	26
unimpeachable	26
form.	26
That	26
day	26
and	26
night	26
they	26
travelled	26
on,	26
nor	26
did	26
anything	26
worth	26
mention	26
happen	26
to	26
them,	26
unless	26
it	26
was	26
that	26
in	26
the	26
course	26
of	26
the	26
night	26
Sancho	26
finished	26
off	26
his	26
task,	26
whereat	26
Don	26
Quixote	26
was	26
beyond	26
measure	26
joyful.	26
He	26
watched	26
for	26
daylight,	26
to	26
see	26
if	26
along	26
the	26
road	26
he	26
should	26
fall	26
in	26
with	26
his	26
already	26
disenchanted	26
lady	26
Dulcinea;	26
and	26
as	26
he	26
pursued	26
his	26
journey	26
there	26
was	26
no	26
woman	26
he	26
met	26
that	26
he	26
did	26
not	26
go	26
up	26
to,	26
to	26
see	26
if	26
she	26
was	26
Dulcinea	26
del	26
Toboso,	26
as	26
he	26
held	26
it	26
absolutely	26
certain	26
that	26
Merlin’s	26
promises	26
could	26
not	26
lie.	26
Full	26
of	26
these	26
thoughts	26
and	26
anxieties,	26
they	26
ascended	26
a	26
rising	26
ground	26
wherefrom	26
they	26
descried	26
their	26
own	26
village,	26
at	26
the	26
sight	26
of	26
which	26
Sancho	26
fell	26
on	26
his	26
knees	26
exclaiming,	26
“Open	26
thine	26
eyes,	26
longed-for	26
home,	26
and	26
see	26
how	26
thy	26
son	26
Sancho	26
Panza	26
comes	26
back	26
to	26
thee,	26
if	26
not	26
very	26
rich,	26
very	26
well	26
whipped!	26
Open	26
thine	26
arms	26
and	26
receive,	26
too,	26
thy	26
son	26
Don	26
Quixote,	26
who,	26
if	26
he	26
comes	26
vanquished	26
by	26
the	26
arm	26
of	26
another,	26
comes	26
victor	26
over	26
himself,	26
which,	26
as	26
he	26
himself	26
has	26
told	26
me,	26
is	26
the	26
greatest	26
victory	26
anyone	26
can	26
desire.	26
I’m	26
bringing	26
back	26
money,	26
for	26
if	26
I	26
was	26
well	26
whipped,	26
I	26
went	26
mounted	26
like	26
a	26
gentleman.”	26

“Have	26
done	26
with	26
these	26
fooleries,”	26
said	26
Don	26
Quixote;	26
“let	26
us	26
push	26
on	26
straight	26
and	26
get	26
to	26
our	26
own	26

With	26
this	26
they	26
descended	26
the	26
slope	26
and	26
directed	26
their	26
steps	26
to	26
their	26
village.	26

At	26
the	26
entrance	26
of	26
the	26
village,	26
so	26
says	26
Cide	26
Hamete,	26
Don	26
Quixote	26
saw	26
two	26
boys	26
quarrelling	26
on	26
the	26
village	26
threshing-floor,	26
one	26
of	26
whom	26
said	26
to	26
the	26
other,	26
“Take	26
it	26
easy,	26
Periquillo;	26
thou	26
shalt	26
never	26
see	26
it	26
again	26
as	26
long	26
as	26
thou	26
livest.”	26
Don	26
Quixote	26
heard	26
this,	26
and	26
said	26
he	26
to	26
Sancho,	26
“Dost	26
thou	26
not	26
mark,	26
friend,	26
what	26
that	26
boy	26
said,	26
‘Thou	26
shalt	26
never	26
see	26
it	26
again	26
as	26
long	26
as	26
thou	26
livest’?”	26
“Well,”	26
said	26
Sancho,	26
“what	26
does	26
it	26
matter	26
if	26
the	26
boy	26
said	26
so?”	26
“What!”	26
said	26
Don	26
Quixote,	26
“dost	26
thou	26
not	26
see	26
that,	26
applied	26
to	26
the	26
object	26
of	26
my	26
desires,	26
the	26
words	26
mean	26
that	26
I	26
am	26
never	26
to	26
see	26
Dulcinea	26
more?”	26
Sancho	26
was	26
about	26
to	26
answer,	26
when	26
his	26
attention	26
was	26
diverted	26
by	26
seeing	26
a	26
hare	26
come	26
flying	26
across	26
the	26
plain	26
pursued	26
by	26
several	26
greyhounds	26
and	26
sportsmen.	26
In	26
its	26
terror	26
it	26
ran	26
to	26
take	26
shelter	26
and	26
hide	26
itself	26
under	26
Dapple.	26
Sancho	26
caught	26
it	26
alive	26
and	26
presented	26
it	26
to	26
Don	26
Quixote,	26
who	26
was	26
saying,	26
“_Malum	26
signum,	26
malum	26
signum!_	26
a	26
hare	26
flies,	26
greyhounds	26
chase	26
it,	26
Dulcinea	26
appears	26
not.”	26
“Your	26
worship’s	26
a	26
strange	26
man,”	26
said	26
Sancho;	26
“let’s	26
take	26
it	26
for	26
granted	26
that	26
this	26
hare	26
is	26
Dulcinea,	26
and	26
these	26
greyhounds	26
chasing	26
it	26
the	26
malignant	26
enchanters	26
who	26
turned	26
her	26
into	26
a	26
country	26
wench;	26
she	26
flies,	26
and	26
I	26
catch	26
her	26
and	26
put	26
her	26
into	26
your	26
worship’s	26
hands,	26
and	26
you	26
hold	26
her	26
in	26
your	26
arms	26
and	26
cherish	26
her;	26
what	26
bad	26
sign	26
is	26
that,	26
or	26
what	26
ill	26
omen	26
is	26
there	26
to	26
be	26
found	26
here?”	26
The	26
two	26
boys	26
who	26
had	26
been	26
quarrelling	26
came	26
over	26
to	26
look	26
at	26
the	26
hare,	26
and	26
Sancho	26
asked	26
one	26
of	26
them	26
what	26
their	26
quarrel	26
was	26
about.	26
He	26
was	26
answered	26
by	26
the	26
one	26
who	26
had	26
said,	26
“Thou	26
shalt	26
never	26
see	26
it	26
again	26
as	26
long	26
as	26
thou	26
livest,”	26
that	26
he	26
had	26
taken	26
a	26
cage	26
full	26
of	26
crickets	26
from	26
the	26
other	26
boy,	26
and	26
did	26
not	26
mean	26
to	26
give	26
it	26
back	26
to	26
him	26
as	26
long	26
as	26
he	26
lived.	26
Sancho	26
took	26
out	26
four	26
cuartos	26
from	26
his	26
pocket	26
and	26
gave	26
them	26
to	26
the	26
boy	26
for	26
the	26
cage,	26
which	26
he	26
placed	26
in	26
Don	26
Quixote’s	26
hands,	26
saying,	26
“There,	26
señor!	26
there	26
are	26
the	26
omens	26
broken	26
and	26
destroyed,	26
and	26
they	26
have	26
no	26
more	26
to	26
do	26
with	26
our	26
affairs,	26
to	26
my	26
thinking,	26
fool	26
as	26
I	26
am,	26
than	26
with	26
last	26
year’s	26
clouds;	26
and	26
if	26
I	26
remember	26
rightly	26
I	26
have	26
heard	26
the	26
curate	26
of	26
our	26
village	26
say	26
that	26
it	26
does	26
not	26
become	26
Christians	26
or	26
sensible	26
people	26
to	26
give	26
any	26
heed	26
to	26
these	26
silly	26
things;	26
and	26
even	26
you	26
yourself	26
said	26
the	26
same	26
to	26
me	26
some	26
time	26
ago,	26
telling	26
me	26
that	26
all	26
Christians	26
who	26
minded	26
omens	26
were	26
fools;	26
but	26
there’s	26
no	26
need	26
of	26
making	26
words	26
about	26
it;	26
let	26
us	26
push	26
on	26
and	26
go	26
into	26
our	26
village.”	26
The	26
sportsmen	26
came	26
up	26
and	26
asked	26
for	26
their	26
hare,	26
which	26
Don	26
Quixote	26
gave	26
them.	26
They	26
then	26
went	26
on,	26
and	26
upon	26
the	26
green	26
at	26
the	26
entrance	26
of	26
the	26
town	26
they	26
came	26
upon	26
the	26
curate	26
and	26
the	26
bachelor	26
Samson	26
Carrasco	26
busy	26
with	26
their	26
breviaries.	26
It	26
should	26
be	26
mentioned	26
that	26
Sancho	26
had	26
thrown,	26
by	26
way	26
of	26
a	26
sumpter-cloth,	26
over	26
Dapple	26
and	26
over	26
the	26
bundle	26
of	26
armour,	26
the	26
buckram	26
robe	26
painted	26
with	26
flames	26
which	26
they	26
had	26
put	26
upon	26
him	26
at	26
the	26
duke’s	26
castle	26
the	26
night	26
Altisidora	26
came	26
back	26
to	26
life.	26
He	26
had	26
also	26
fixed	26
the	26
mitre	26
on	26
Dapple’s	26
head,	26
the	26
oddest	26
transformation	26
and	26
decoration	26
that	26
ever	26
ass	26
in	26
the	26
world	26
underwent.	26
They	26
were	26
at	26
once	26
recognised	26
by	26
both	26
the	26
curate	26
and	26
the	26
bachelor,	26
who	26
came	26
towards	26
them	26
with	26
open	26
arms.	26
Don	26
Quixote	26
dismounted	26
and	26
received	26
them	26
with	26
a	26
close	26
embrace;	26
and	26
the	26
boys,	26
who	26
are	26
lynxes	26
that	26
nothing	26
escapes,	26
spied	26
out	26
the	26
ass’s	26
mitre	26
and	26
came	26
running	26
to	26
see	26
it,	26
calling	26
out	26
to	26
one	26
another,	26
“Come	26
here,	26
boys,	26
and	26
see	26
Sancho	26
Panza’s	26
ass	26
figged	26
out	26
finer	26
than	26
Mingo,	26
and	26
Don	26
Quixote’s	26
beast	26
leaner	26
than	26
ever.”	26
So	26
at	26
length,	26
with	26
the	26
boys	26
capering	26
round	26
them,	26
and	26
accompanied	26
by	26
the	26
curate	26
and	26
the	26
bachelor,	26
they	26
made	26
their	26
entrance	26
into	26
the	26
town,	26
and	26
proceeded	26
to	26
Don	26
Quixote’s	26
house,	26
at	26
the	26
door	26
of	26
which	26
they	26
found	26
his	26
housekeeper	26
and	26
niece,	26
whom	26
the	26
news	26
of	26
his	26
arrival	26
had	26
already	26
reached.	26
It	26
had	26
been	26
brought	26
to	26
Teresa	26
Panza,	26
Sancho’s	26
wife,	26
as	26
well,	26
and	26
she	26
with	26
her	26
hair	26
all	26
loose	26
and	26
half	26
naked,	26
dragging	26
Sanchica	26
her	26
daughter	26
by	26
the	26
hand,	26
ran	26
out	26
to	26
meet	26
her	26
husband;	26
but	26
seeing	26
him	26
coming	26
in	26
by	26
no	26
means	26
as	26
good	26
case	26
as	26
she	26
thought	26
a	26
governor	26
ought	26
to	26
be,	26
she	26
said	26
to	26
him,	26
“How	26
is	26
it	26
you	26
come	26
this	26
way,	26
husband?	26
It	26
seems	26
to	26
me	26
you	26
come	26
tramping	26
and	26
footsore,	26
and	26
looking	26
more	26
like	26
a	26
disorderly	26
vagabond	26
than	26
a	26
governor.”	26
“Hold	26
your	26
tongue,	26
Teresa,”	26
said	26
Sancho;	26
“often	26
‘where	26
there	26
are	26
pegs	26
there	26
are	26
no	26
flitches;’	26
let’s	26
go	26
into	26
the	26
house	26
and	26
there	26
you’ll	26
hear	26
strange	26
things.	26
I	26
bring	26
money,	26
and	26
that’s	26
the	26
main	26
thing,	26
got	26
by	26
my	26
own	26
industry	26
without	26
wronging	26
anybody.”	26
“You	26
bring	26
the	26
money,	26
my	26
good	26
husband,”	26
said	26
Teresa,	26
“and	26
no	26
matter	26
whether	26
it	26
was	26
got	26
this	26
way	26
or	26
that;	26
for,	26
however	26
you	26
may	26
have	26
got	26
it,	26
you’ll	26
not	26
have	26
brought	26
any	26
new	26
practice	26
into	26
the	26
world.”	26
Sanchica	26
embraced	26
her	26
father	26
and	26
asked	26
him	26
if	26
he	26
brought	26
her	26
anything,	26
for	26
she	26
had	26
been	26
looking	26
out	26
for	26
him	26
as	26
for	26
the	26
showers	26
of	26
May;	26
and	26
she	26
taking	26
hold	26
of	26
him	26
by	26
the	26
girdle	26
on	26
one	26
side,	26
and	26
his	26
wife	26
by	26
the	26
hand,	26
while	26
the	26
daughter	26
led	26
Dapple,	26
they	26
made	26
for	26
their	26
house,	26
leaving	26
Don	26
Quixote	26
in	26
his,	26
in	26
the	26
hands	26
of	26
his	26
niece	26
and	26
housekeeper,	26
and	26
in	26
the	26
company	26
of	26
the	26
curate	26
and	26
the	26
bachelor.	26
Don	26
Quixote	26
at	26
once,	26
without	26
any	26
regard	26
to	26
time	26
or	26
season,	26
withdrew	26
in	26
private	26
with	26
the	26
bachelor	26
and	26
the	26
curate,	26
and	26
in	26
a	26
few	26
words	26
told	26
them	26
of	26
his	26
defeat,	26
and	26
of	26
the	26
engagement	26
he	26
was	26
under	26
not	26
to	26
quit	26
his	26
village	26
for	26
a	26
year,	26
which	26
he	26
meant	26
to	26
keep	26
to	26
the	26
letter	26
without	26
departing	26
a	26
hair’s	26
breadth	26
from	26
it,	26
as	26
became	26
a	26
knight-errant	26
bound	26
by	26
scrupulous	26
good	26
faith	26
and	26
the	26
laws	26
of	26
knight-errantry;	26
and	26
of	26
how	26
he	26
thought	26
of	26
turning	26
shepherd	26
for	26
that	26
year,	26
and	26
taking	26
his	26
diversion	26
in	26
the	26
solitude	26
of	26
the	26
fields,	26
where	26
he	26
could	26
with	26
perfect	26
freedom	26
give	26
range	26
to	26
his	26
thoughts	26
of	26
love	26
while	26
he	26
followed	26
the	26
virtuous	26
pastoral	26
calling;	26
and	26
he	26
besought	26
them,	26
if	26
they	26
had	26
not	26
a	26
great	26
deal	26
to	26
do	26
and	26
were	26
not	26
prevented	26
by	26
more	26
important	26
business,	26
to	26
consent	26
to	26
be	26
his	26
companions,	26
for	26
he	26
would	26
buy	26
sheep	26
enough	26
to	26
qualify	26
them	26
for	26
shepherds;	26
and	26
the	26
most	26
important	26
point	26
of	26
the	26
whole	26
affair,	26
he	26
could	26
tell	26
them,	26
was	26
settled,	26
for	26
he	26
had	26
given	26
them	26
names	26
that	26
would	26
fit	26
them	26
to	26
a	26
T.	26
The	26
curate	26
asked	26
what	26
they	26
were.	26
Don	26
Quixote	26
replied	26
that	26
he	26
himself	26
was	26
to	26
be	26
called	26
the	26
shepherd	26
Quixotize	26
and	26
the	26
bachelor	26
the	26
shepherd	26
Carrascon,	26
and	26
the	26
curate	26
the	26
shepherd	26
Curambro,	26
and	26
Sancho	26
Panza	26
the	26
shepherd	26
Pancino.	26
Both	26
were	26
astounded	26
at	26
Don	26
Quixote’s	26
new	26
craze;	26
however,	26
lest	26
he	26
should	26
once	26
more	26
make	26
off	26
out	26
of	26
the	26
village	26
from	26
them	26
in	26
pursuit	26
of	26
his	26
chivalry,	26
they	26
trusting	26
that	26
in	26
the	26
course	26
of	26
the	26
year	26
he	26
might	26
be	26
cured,	26
fell	26
in	26
with	26
his	26
new	26
project,	26
applauded	26
his	26
crazy	26
idea	26
as	26
a	26
bright	26
one,	26
and	26
offered	26
to	26
share	26
the	26
life	26
with	26
him.	26
“And	26
what’s	26
more,”	26
said	26
Samson	26
Carrasco,	26
“I	26
am,	26
as	26
all	26
the	26
world	26
knows,	26
a	26
very	26
famous	26
poet,	26
and	26
I’ll	26
be	26
always	26
making	26
verses,	26
pastoral,	26
or	26
courtly,	26
or	26
as	26
it	26
may	26
come	26
into	26
my	26
head,	26
to	26
pass	26
away	26
our	26
time	26
in	26
those	26
secluded	26
regions	26
where	26
we	26
shall	26
be	26
roaming.	26
But	26
what	26
is	26
most	26
needful,	26
sirs,	26
is	26
that	26
each	26
of	26
us	26
should	26
choose	26
the	26
name	26
of	26
the	26
shepherdess	26
he	26
means	26
to	26
glorify	26
in	26
his	26
verses,	26
and	26
that	26
we	26
should	26
not	26
leave	26
a	26
tree,	26
be	26
it	26
ever	26
so	26
hard,	26
without	26
writing	26
up	26
and	26
carving	26
her	26
name	26
on	26
it,	26
as	26
is	26
the	26
habit	26
and	26
custom	26
of	26
love-smitten	26
shepherds.”	26
“That’s	26
the	26
very	26
thing,”	26
said	26
Don	26
Quixote;	26
“though	26
I	26
am	26
relieved	26
from	26
looking	26
for	26
the	26
name	26
of	26
an	26
imaginary	26
shepherdess,	26
for	26
there’s	26
the	26
peerless	26
Dulcinea	26
del	26
Toboso,	26
the	26
glory	26
of	26
these	26
brooksides,	26
the	26
ornament	26
of	26
these	26
meadows,	26
the	26
mainstay	26
of	26
beauty,	26
the	26
cream	26
of	26
all	26
the	26
graces,	26
and,	26
in	26
a	26
word,	26
the	26
being	26
to	26
whom	26
all	26
praise	26
is	26
appropriate,	26
be	26
it	26
ever	26
so	26
hyperbolical.”	26
“Very	26
true,”	26
said	26
the	26
curate;	26
“but	26
we	26
the	26
others	26
must	26
look	26
about	26
for	26
accommodating	26
shepherdesses	26
that	26
will	26
answer	26
our	26
purpose	26
one	26
way	26
or	26
another.”	26
“And,”	26
added	26
Samson	26
Carrasco,	26
“if	26
they	26
fail	26
us,	26
we	26
can	26
call	26
them	26
by	26
the	26
names	26
of	26
the	26
ones	26
in	26
print	26
that	26
the	26
world	26
is	26
filled	26
with,	26
Fílidas,	26
Amarilises,	26
Dianas,	26
Fleridas,	26
Galateas,	26
Belisardas;	26
for	26
as	26
they	26
sell	26
them	26
in	26
the	26
market-places	26
we	26
may	26
fairly	26
buy	26
them	26
and	26
make	26
them	26
our	26
own.	26
If	26
my	26
lady,	26
or	26
I	26
should	26
say	26
my	26
shepherdess,	26
happens	26
to	26
be	26
called	26
Ana,	26
I’ll	26
sing	26
her	26
praises	26
under	26
the	26
name	26
of	26
Anarda,	26
and	26
if	26
Francisca,	26
I’ll	26
call	26
her	26
Francenia,	26
and	26
if	26
Lucia,	26
Lucinda,	26
for	26
it	26
all	26
comes	26
to	26
the	26
same	26
thing;	26
and	26
Sancho	26
Panza,	26
if	26
he	26
joins	26
this	26
fraternity,	26
may	26
glorify	26
his	26
wife	26
Teresa	26
Panza	26
as	26
Teresaina.”	26
Don	26
Quixote	26
laughed	26
at	26
the	26
adaptation	26
of	26
the	26
name,	26
and	26
the	26
curate	26
bestowed	26
vast	26
praise	26
upon	26
the	26
worthy	26
and	26
honourable	26
resolution	26
he	26
had	26
made,	26
and	26
again	26
offered	26
to	26
bear	26
him	26
company	26
all	26
the	26
time	26
that	26
he	26
could	26
spare	26
from	26
his	26
imperative	26
duties.	26
And	26
so	26
they	26
took	26
their	26
leave	26
of	26
him,	26
recommending	26
and	26
beseeching	26
him	26
to	26
take	26
care	26
of	26
his	26
health	26
and	26
treat	26
himself	26
to	26
a	26
suitable	26
diet.	26
It	26
so	26
happened	26
his	26
niece	26
and	26
the	26
housekeeper	26
overheard	26
all	26
the	26
three	26
of	26
them	26
said;	26
and	26
as	26
soon	26
as	26
they	26
were	26
gone	26
they	26
both	26
of	26
them	26
came	26
in	26
to	26
Don	26
Quixote,	26
and	26
said	26
the	26
niece,	26
“What’s	26
this,	26
uncle?	26
Now	26
that	26
we	26
were	26
thinking	26
you	26
had	26
come	26
back	26
to	26
stay	26
at	26
home	26
and	26
lead	26
a	26
quiet	26
respectable	26
life	26
there,	26
are	26
you	26
going	26
to	26
get	26
into	26
fresh	26
entanglements,	26
and	26
turn	26
‘young	26
shepherd,	26
thou	26
that	26
comest	26
here,	26
young	26
shepherd	26
going	26
there?’	26
Nay!	26
indeed	26
‘the	26
straw	26
is	26
too	26
hard	26
now	26
to	26
make	26
pipes	26
of.’”	26
“And,”	26
added	26
the	26
housekeeper,	26
“will	26
your	26
worship	26
be	26
able	26
to	26
bear,	26
out	26
in	26
the	26
fields,	26
the	26
heats	26
of	26
summer,	26
and	26
the	26
chills	26
of	26
winter,	26
and	26
the	26
howling	26
of	26
the	26
wolves?	26
Not	26
you;	26
for	26
that’s	26
a	26
life	26
and	26
a	26
business	26
for	26
hardy	26
men,	26
bred	26
and	26
seasoned	26
to	26
such	26
work	26
almost	26
from	26
the	26
time	26
they	26
were	26
in	26
swaddling-clothes.	26
Why,	26
to	26
make	26
choice	26
of	26
evils,	26
it’s	26
better	26
to	26
be	26
a	26
knight-errant	26
than	26
a	26
shepherd!	26
Look	26
here,	26
señor;	26
take	26
my	26
advice—and	26
I’m	26
not	26
giving	26
it	26
to	26
you	26
full	26
of	26
bread	26
and	26
wine,	26
but	26
fasting,	26
and	26
with	26
fifty	26
years	26
upon	26
my	26
head—stay	26
at	26
home,	26
look	26
after	26
your	26
affairs,	26
go	26
often	26
to	26
confession,	26
be	26
good	26
to	26
the	26
poor,	26
and	26
upon	26
my	26
soul	26
be	26
it	26
if	26
any	26
evil	26
comes	26
to	26
you.”	26
“Hold	26
your	26
peace,	26
my	26
daughters,”	26
said	26
Don	26
Quixote;	26
“I	26
know	26
very	26
well	26
what	26
my	26
duty	26
is;	26
help	26
me	26
to	26
bed,	26
for	26
I	26
don’t	26
feel	26
very	26
well;	26
and	26
rest	26
assured	26
that,	26
knight-errant	26
now	26
or	26
wandering	26
shepherd	26
to	26
be,	26
I	26
shall	26
never	26
fail	26
to	26
have	26
a	26
care	26
for	26
your	26
interests,	26
as	26
you	26
will	26
see	26
in	26
the	26
end.”	26
And	26
the	26
good	26
wenches	26
(for	26
that	26
they	26
undoubtedly	26
were),	26
the	26
housekeeper	26
and	26
niece,	26
helped	26
him	26
to	26
bed,	26
where	26
they	26
gave	26
him	26
something	26
to	26
eat	26
and	26
made	26
him	26
as	26
comfortable	26
as	26
possible.	26

beginning	26
to	26
its	26
end,	26
and	26
above	26
all	26
man’s	26
life,	26
and	26
as	26
Don	26
Quixote’s	26
enjoyed	26
no	26
special	26
dispensation	26
from	26
heaven	26
to	26
stay	26
its	26
course,	26
its	26
end	26
and	26
close	26
came	26
when	26
he	26
least	26
looked	26
for	26
it.	26
For—whether	26
it	26
was	26
of	26
the	26
dejection	26
the	26
thought	26
of	26
his	26
defeat	26
produced,	26
or	26
of	26
heaven’s	26
will	26
that	26
so	26
ordered	26
it—a	26
fever	26
settled	26
upon	26
him	26
and	26
kept	26
him	26
in	26
his	26
bed	26
for	26
six	26
days,	26
during	26
which	26
he	26
was	26
often	26
visited	26
by	26
his	26
friends	26
the	26
curate,	26
the	26
bachelor,	26
and	26
the	26
barber,	26
while	26
his	26
good	26
squire	26
Sancho	26
Panza	26
never	26
quitted	26
his	26
bedside.	26
They,	26
persuaded	26
that	26
it	26
was	26
grief	26
at	26
finding	26
himself	26
vanquished,	26
and	26
the	26
object	26
of	26
his	26
heart,	26
the	26
liberation	26
and	26
disenchantment	26
of	26
Dulcinea,	26
unattained,	26
that	26
kept	26
him	26
in	26
this	26
state,	26
strove	26
by	26
all	26
the	26
means	26
in	26
their	26
power	26
to	26
cheer	26
him	26
up;	26
the	26
bachelor	26
bidding	26
him	26
take	26
heart	26
and	26
get	26
up	26
to	26
begin	26
his	26
pastoral	26
life,	26
for	26
which	26
he	26
himself,	26
he	26
said,	26
had	26
already	26
composed	26
an	26
eclogue	26
that	26
would	26
take	26
the	26
shine	26
out	26
of	26
all	26
Sannazaro	26
had	26
ever	26
written,	26
and	26
had	26
bought	26
with	26
his	26
own	26
money	26
two	26
famous	26
dogs	26
to	26
guard	26
the	26
flock,	26
one	26
called	26
Barcino	26
and	26
the	26
other	26
Butron,	26
which	26
a	26
herdsman	26
of	26
Quintanar	26
had	26
sold	26
him.	26
But	26
for	26
all	26
this	26
Don	26
Quixote	26
could	26
not	26
shake	26
off	26
his	26
sadness.	26
His	26
friends	26
called	26
in	26
the	26
doctor,	26
who	26
felt	26
his	26
pulse	26
and	26
was	26
not	26
very	26
well	26
satisfied	26
with	26
it,	26
and	26
said	26
that	26
in	26
any	26
case	26
it	26
would	26
be	26
well	26
for	26
him	26
to	26
attend	26
to	26
the	26
health	26
of	26
his	26
soul,	26
as	26
that	26
of	26
his	26
body	26
was	26
in	26
a	26
bad	26
way.	26
Don	26
Quixote	26
heard	26
this	26
calmly;	26
but	26
not	26
so	26
his	26
housekeeper,	26
his	26
niece,	26
and	26
his	26
squire,	26
who	26
fell	26
weeping	26
bitterly,	26
as	26
if	26
they	26
had	26
him	26
lying	26
dead	26
before	26
them.	26
The	26
doctor’s	26
opinion	26
was	26
that	26
melancholy	26
and	26
depression	26
were	26
bringing	26
him	26
to	26
his	26
end.	26
Don	26
Quixote	26
begged	26
them	26
to	26
leave	26
him	26
to	26
himself,	26
as	26
he	26
had	26
a	26
wish	26
to	26
sleep	26
a	26
little.	26
They	26
obeyed,	26
and	26
he	26
slept	26
at	26
one	26
stretch,	26
as	26
the	26
saying	26
is,	26
more	26
than	26
six	26
hours,	26
so	26
that	26
the	26
housekeeper	26
and	26
niece	26
thought	26
he	26
was	26
going	26
to	26
sleep	26
for	26
ever.	26
But	26
at	26
the	26
end	26
of	26
that	26
time	26
he	26
woke	26
up,	26
and	26
in	26
a	26
loud	26
voice	26
exclaimed,	26
“Blessed	26
be	26
Almighty	26
God,	26
who	26
has	26
shown	26
me	26
such	26
goodness.	26
In	26
truth	26
his	26
mercies	26
are	26
boundless,	26
and	26
the	26
sins	26
of	26
men	26
can	26
neither	26
limit	26
them	26
nor	26
keep	26
them	26
back!”	26
The	26
niece	26
listened	26
with	26
attention	26
to	26
her	26
uncle’s	26
words,	26
and	26
they	26
struck	26
her	26
as	26
more	26
coherent	26
than	26
what	26
usually	26
fell	26
from	26
him,	26
at	26
least	26
during	26
his	26
illness,	26
so	26
she	26
asked,	26
“What	26
are	26
you	26
saying,	26
señor?	26
Has	26
anything	26
strange	26
occurred?	26
What	26
mercies	26
or	26
what	26
sins	26
of	26
men	26
are	26
you	26
talking	26
of?”	26
“The	26
mercies,	26
niece,”	26
said	26
Don	26
Quixote,	26
“are	26
those	26
that	26
God	26
has	26
this	26
moment	26
shown	26
me,	26
and	26
with	26
him,	26
as	26
I	26
said,	26
my	26
sins	26
are	26
no	26
impediment	26
to	26
them.	26
My	26
reason	26
is	26
now	26
free	26
and	26
clear,	26
rid	26
of	26
the	26
dark	26
shadows	26
of	26
ignorance	26
that	26
my	26
unhappy	26
constant	26
study	26
of	26
those	26
detestable	26
books	26
of	26
chivalry	26
cast	26
over	26
it.	26
Now	26
I	26
see	26
through	26
their	26
absurdities	26
and	26
deceptions,	26
and	26
it	26
only	26
grieves	26
me	26
that	26
this	26
destruction	26
of	26
my	26
illusions	26
has	26
come	26
so	26
late	26
that	26
it	26
leaves	26
me	26
no	26
time	26
to	26
make	26
some	26
amends	26
by	26
reading	26
other	26
books	26
that	26
might	26
be	26
a	26
light	26
to	26
my	26
soul.	26
Niece,	26
I	26
feel	26
myself	26
at	26
the	26
point	26
of	26
death,	26
and	26
I	26
would	26
fain	26
meet	26
it	26
in	26
such	26
a	26
way	26
as	26
to	26
show	26
that	26
my	26
life	26
has	26
not	26
been	26
so	26
ill	26
that	26
I	26
should	26
leave	26
behind	26
me	26
the	26
name	26
of	26
a	26
madman;	26
for	26
though	26
I	26
have	26
been	26
one,	26
I	26
would	26
not	26
that	26
the	26
fact	26
should	26
be	26
made	26
plainer	26
at	26
my	26
death.	26
Call	26
in	26
to	26
me,	26
my	26
dear,	26
my	26
good	26
friends	26
the	26
curate,	26
the	26
bachelor	26
Samson	26
Carrasco,	26
and	26
Master	26
Nicholas	26
the	26
barber,	26
for	26
I	26
wish	26
to	26
confess	26
and	26
make	26
my	26
will.”	26
But	26
his	26
niece	26
was	26
saved	26
the	26
trouble	26
by	26
the	26
entrance	26
of	26
the	26
three.	26
The	26
instant	26
Don	26
Quixote	26
saw	26
them	26
he	26
exclaimed,	26
“Good	26
news	26
for	26
you,	26
good	26
sirs,	26
that	26
I	26
am	26
no	26
longer	26
Don	26
Quixote	26
of	26
La	26
Mancha,	26
but	26
Alonso	26
Quixano,	26
whose	26
way	26
of	26
life	26
won	26
for	26
him	26
the	26
name	26
of	26
Good.	26
Now	26
am	26
I	26
the	26
enemy	26
of	26
Amadis	26
of	26
Gaul	26
and	26
of	26
the	26
whole	26
countless	26
troop	26
of	26
his	26
descendants;	26
odious	26
to	26
me	26
now	26
are	26
all	26
the	26
profane	26
stories	26
of	26
knight-errantry;	26
now	26
I	26
perceive	26
my	26
folly,	26
and	26
the	26
peril	26
into	26
which	26
reading	26
them	26
brought	26
me;	26
now,	26
by	26
God’s	26
mercy	26
schooled	26
into	26
my	26
right	26
senses,	26
I	26
loathe	26
them.”	26
When	26
the	26
three	26
heard	26
him	26
speak	26
in	26
this	26
way,	26
they	26
had	26
no	26
doubt	26
whatever	26
that	26
some	26
new	26
craze	26
had	26
taken	26
possession	26
of	26
him;	26
and	26
said	26
Samson,	26
“What?	26
Señor	26
Don	26
Quixote!	26
Now	26
that	26
we	26
have	26
intelligence	26
of	26
the	26
lady	26
Dulcinea	26
being	26
disenchanted,	26
are	26
you	26
taking	26
this	26
line;	26
now,	26
just	26
as	26
we	26
are	26
on	26
the	26
point	26
of	26
becoming	26
shepherds,	26
to	26
pass	26
our	26
lives	26
singing,	26
like	26
princes,	26
are	26
you	26
thinking	26
of	26
turning	26
hermit?	26
Hush,	26
for	26
heaven’s	26
sake,	26
be	26
rational	26
and	26
let’s	26
have	26
no	26
more	26
nonsense.”	26
“All	26
that	26
nonsense,”	26
said	26
Don	26
Quixote,	26
“that	26
until	26
now	26
has	26
been	26
a	26
reality	26
to	26
my	26
hurt,	26
my	26
death	26
will,	26
with	26
heaven’s	26
help,	26
turn	26
to	26
my	26
good.	26
I	26
feel,	26
sirs,	26
that	26
I	26
am	26
rapidly	26
drawing	26
near	26
death;	26
a	26
truce	26
to	26
jesting;	26
let	26
me	26
have	26
a	26
confessor	26
to	26
confess	26
me,	26
and	26
a	26
notary	26
to	26
make	26
my	26
will;	26
for	26
in	26
extremities	26
like	26
this,	26
man	26
must	26
not	26
trifle	26
with	26
his	26
soul;	26
and	26
while	26
the	26
curate	26
is	26
confessing	26
me	26
let	26
someone,	26
I	26
beg,	26
go	26
for	26
the	26
notary.”	26
They	26
looked	26
at	26
one	26
another,	26
wondering	26
at	26
Don	26
Quixote’s	26
words;	26
but,	26
though	26
uncertain,	26
they	26
were	26
inclined	26
to	26
believe	26
him,	26
and	26
one	26
of	26
the	26
signs	26
by	26
which	26
they	26
came	26
to	26
the	26
conclusion	26
he	26
was	26
dying	26
was	26
this	26
so	26
sudden	26
and	26
complete	26
return	26
to	26
his	26
senses	26
after	26
having	26
been	26
mad;	26
for	26
to	26
the	26
words	26
already	26
quoted	26
he	26
added	26
much	26
more,	26
so	26
well	26
expressed,	26
so	26
devout,	26
and	26
so	26
rational,	26
as	26
to	26
banish	26
all	26
doubt	26
and	26
convince	26
them	26
that	26
he	26
was	26
sound	26
of	26
mind.	26
The	26
curate	26
turned	26
them	26
all	26
out,	26
and	26
left	26
alone	26
with	26
him	26
confessed	26
him.	26
The	26
bachelor	26
went	26
for	26
the	26
notary	26
and	26
returned	26
shortly	26
afterwards	26
with	26
him	26
and	26
with	26
Sancho,	26
who,	26
having	26
already	26
learned	26
from	26
the	26
bachelor	26
the	26
condition	26
his	26
master	26
was	26
in,	26
and	26
finding	26
the	26
housekeeper	26
and	26
niece	26
weeping,	26
began	26
to	26
blubber	26
and	26
shed	26
tears.	26
The	26
confession	26
over,	26
the	26
curate	26
came	26
out	26
saying,	26
“Alonso	26
Quixano	26
the	26
Good	26
is	26
indeed	26
dying,	26
and	26
is	26
indeed	26
in	26
his	26
right	26
mind;	26
we	26
may	26
now	26
go	26
in	26
to	26
him	26
while	26
he	26
makes	26
his	26
will.”	26
This	26
news	26
gave	26
a	26
tremendous	26
impulse	26
to	26
the	26
brimming	26
eyes	26
of	26
the	26
housekeeper,	26
niece,	26
and	26
Sancho	26
Panza	26
his	26
good	26
squire,	26
making	26
the	26
tears	26
burst	26
from	26
their	26
eyes	26
and	26
a	26
host	26
of	26
sighs	26
from	26
their	26
hearts;	26
for	26
of	26
a	26
truth,	26
as	26
has	26
been	26
said	26
more	26
than	26
once,	26
whether	26
as	26
plain	26
Alonso	26
Quixano	26
the	26
Good,	26
or	26
as	26
Don	26
Quixote	26
of	26
La	26
Mancha,	26
Don	26
Quixote	26
was	26
always	26
of	26
a	26
gentle	26
disposition	26
and	26
kindly	26
in	26
all	26
his	26
ways,	26
and	26
hence	26
he	26
was	26
beloved,	26
not	26
only	26
by	26
those	26
of	26
his	26
own	26
house,	26
but	26
by	26
all	26
who	26
knew	26
him.	26
The	26
notary	26
came	26
in	26
with	26
the	26
rest,	26
and	26
as	26
soon	26
as	26
the	26
preamble	26
of	26
the	26
will	26
had	26
been	26
set	26
out	26
and	26
Don	26
Quixote	26
had	26
commended	26
his	26
soul	26
to	26
God	26
with	26
all	26
the	26
devout	26
formalities	26
that	26
are	26
usual,	26
coming	26
to	26
the	26
bequests,	26
he	26
said,	26
“Item,	26
it	26
is	26
my	26
will	26
that,	26
touching	26
certain	26
moneys	26
in	26
the	26
hands	26
of	26
Sancho	26
Panza	26
(whom	26
in	26
my	26
madness	26
I	26
made	26
my	26
squire),	26
inasmuch	26
as	26
between	26
him	26
and	26
me	26
there	26
have	26
been	26
certain	26
accounts	26
and	26
debits	26
and	26
credits,	26
no	26
claim	26
be	26
made	26
against	26
him,	26
nor	26
any	26
account	26
demanded	26
of	26
him	26
in	26
respect	26
of	26
them;	26
but	26
that	26
if	26
anything	26
remain	26
over	26
and	26
above,	26
after	26
he	26
has	26
paid	26
himself	26
what	26
I	26
owe	26
him,	26
the	26
balance,	26
which	26
will	26
be	26
but	26
little,	26
shall	26
be	26
his,	26
and	26
much	26
good	26
may	26
it	26
do	26
him;	26
and	26
if,	26
as	26
when	26
I	26
was	26
mad	26
I	26
had	26
a	26
share	26
in	26
giving	26
him	26
the	26
government	26
of	26
an	26
island,	26
so,	26
now	26
that	26
I	26
am	26
in	26
my	26
senses,	26
I	26
could	26
give	26
him	26
that	26
of	26
a	26
kingdom,	26
it	26
should	26
be	26
his,	26
for	26
the	26
simplicity	26
of	26
his	26
character	26
and	26
the	26
fidelity	26
of	26
his	26
conduct	26
deserve	26
it.”	26
And	26
then,	26
turning	26
to	26
Sancho,	26
he	26
said,	26
“Forgive	26
me,	26
my	26
friend,	26
that	26
I	26
led	26
thee	26
to	26
seem	26
as	26
mad	26
as	26
myself,	26
making	26
thee	26
fall	26
into	26
the	26
same	26
error	26
I	26
myself	26
fell	26
into,	26
that	26
there	26
were	26
and	26
still	26
are	26
knights-errant	26
in	26
the	26
world.”	26
“Ah!”	26
said	26
Sancho	26
weeping,	26
“don’t	26
die,	26
master,	26
but	26
take	26
my	26
advice	26
and	26
live	26
many	26
years;	26
for	26
the	26
foolishest	26
thing	26
a	26
man	26
can	26
do	26
in	26
this	26
life	26
is	26
to	26
let	26
himself	26
die	26
without	26
rhyme	26
or	26
reason,	26
without	26
anybody	26
killing	26
him,	26
or	26
any	26
hands	26
but	26
melancholy’s	26
making	26
an	26
end	26
of	26
him.	26
Come,	26
don’t	26
be	26
lazy,	26
but	26
get	26
up	26
from	26
your	26
bed	26
and	26
let	26
us	26
take	26
to	26
the	26
fields	26
in	26
shepherd’s	26
trim	26
as	26
we	26
agreed.	26
Perhaps	26
behind	26
some	26
bush	26
we	26
shall	26
find	26
the	26
lady	26
Dulcinea	26
disenchanted,	26
as	26
fine	26
as	26
fine	26
can	26
be.	26
If	26
it	26
be	26
that	26
you	26
are	26
dying	26
of	26
vexation	26
at	26
having	26
been	26
vanquished,	26
lay	26
the	26
blame	26
on	26
me,	26
and	26
say	26
you	26
were	26
overthrown	26
because	26
I	26
had	26
girthed	26
Rocinante	26
badly;	26
besides	26
you	26
must	26
have	26
seen	26
in	26
your	26
books	26
of	26
chivalry	26
that	26
it	26
is	26
a	26
common	26
thing	26
for	26
knights	26
to	26
upset	26
one	26
another,	26
and	26
for	26
him	26
who	26
is	26
conquered	26
to-day	26
to	26
be	26
conqueror	26
to-morrow.”	26
“Very	26
true,”	26
said	26
Samson,	26
“and	26
good	26
Sancho	26
Panza’s	26
view	26
of	26
these	26
cases	26
is	26
quite	26
right.”	26
“Sirs,	26
not	26
so	26
fast,”	26
said	26
Don	26
Quixote,	26
“‘in	26
last	26
year’s	26
nests	26
there	26
are	26
no	26
birds	26
this	26
year.’	26
I	26
was	26
mad,	26
now	26
I	26
am	26
in	26
my	26
senses;	26
I	26
was	26
Don	26
Quixote	26
of	26
La	26
Mancha,	26
I	26
am	26
now,	26
as	26
I	26
said,	26
Alonso	26
Quixano	26
the	26
Good;	26
and	26
may	26
my	26
repentance	26
and	26
sincerity	26
restore	26
me	26
to	26
the	26
esteem	26
you	26
used	26
to	26
have	26
for	26
me;	26
and	26
now	26
let	26
Master	26
Notary	26
proceed.	26
“Item,	26
I	26
leave	26
all	26
my	26
property	26
absolutely	26
to	26
Antonia	26
Quixana	26
my	26
niece,	26
here	26
present,	26
after	26
all	26
has	26
been	26
deducted	26
from	26
the	26
most	26
available	26
portion	26
of	26
it	26
that	26
may	26
be	26
required	26
to	26
satisfy	26
the	26
bequests	26
I	26
have	26
made.	26
And	26
the	26
first	26
disbursement	26
I	26
desire	26
to	26
be	26
made	26
is	26
the	26
payment	26
of	26
the	26
wages	26
I	26
owe	26
for	26
the	26
time	26
my	26
housekeeper	26
has	26
served	26
me,	26
with	26
twenty	26
ducats,	26
over	26
and	26
above,	26
for	26
a	26
gown.	26
The	26
curate	26
and	26
the	26
bachelor	26
Samson	26
Carrasco,	26
now	26
present,	26
I	26
appoint	26
my	26
executors.	26
“Item,	26
it	26
is	26
my	26
wish	26
that	26
if	26
Antonia	26
Quixana,	26
my	26
niece,	26
desires	26
to	26
marry,	26
she	26
shall	26
marry	26
a	26
man	26
of	26
whom	26
it	26
shall	26
be	26
first	26
of	26
all	26
ascertained	26
by	26
information	26
taken	26
that	26
he	26
does	26
not	26
know	26
what	26
books	26
of	26
chivalry	26
are;	26
and	26
if	26
it	26
should	26
be	26
proved	26
that	26
he	26
does,	26
and	26
if,	26
in	26
spite	26
of	26
this,	26
my	26
niece	26
insists	26
upon	26
marrying	26
him,	26
and	26
does	26
marry	26
him,	26
then	26
that	26
she	26
shall	26
forfeit	26
the	26
whole	26
of	26
what	26
I	26
have	26
left	26
her,	26
which	26
my	26
executors	26
shall	26
devote	26
to	26
works	26
of	26
charity	26
as	26
they	26
please.	26
“Item,	26
I	26
entreat	26
the	26
aforesaid	26
gentlemen	26
my	26
executors,	26
that,	26
if	26
any	26
happy	26
chance	26
should	26
lead	26
them	26
to	26
discover	26
the	26
author	26
who	26
is	26
said	26
to	26
have	26
written	26
a	26
history	26
now	26
going	26
about	26
under	26
the	26
title	26
of	26
‘Second	26
Part	26
of	26
the	26
Achievements	26
of	26
Don	26
Quixote	26
of	26
La	26
Mancha,’	26
they	26
beg	26
of	26
him	26
on	26
my	26
behalf	26
as	26
earnestly	26
as	26
they	26
can	26
to	26
forgive	26
me	26
for	26
having	26
been,	26
without	26
intending	26
it,	26
the	26
cause	26
of	26
his	26
writing	26
so	26
many	26
and	26
such	26
monstrous	26
absurdities	26
as	26
he	26
has	26
written	26
in	26
it;	26
for	26
I	26
am	26
leaving	26
the	26
world	26
with	26
a	26
feeling	26
of	26
compunction	26
at	26
having	26
provoked	26
him	26
to	26
write	26
them.”	26
With	26
this	26
he	26
closed	26
his	26
will,	26
and	26
a	26
faintness	26
coming	26
over	26
him	26
he	26
stretched	26
himself	26
out	26
at	26
full	26
length	26
on	26
the	26
bed.	26
All	26
were	26
in	26
a	26
flutter	26
and	26
made	26
haste	26
to	26
relieve	26
him,	26
and	26
during	26
the	26
three	26
days	26
he	26
lived	26
after	26
that	26
on	26
which	26
he	26
made	26
his	26
will	26
he	26
fainted	26
away	26
very	26
often.	26
The	26
house	26
was	26
all	26
in	26
confusion;	26
but	26
still	26
the	26
niece	26
ate	26
and	26
the	26
housekeeper	26
drank	26
and	26
Sancho	26
Panza	26
enjoyed	26
himself;	26
for	26
inheriting	26
property	26
wipes	26
out	26
or	26
softens	26
down	26
in	26
the	26
heir	26
the	26
feeling	26
of	26
grief	26
the	26
dead	26
man	26
might	26
be	26
expected	26
to	26
leave	26
behind	26
him.	26

At	26
last	26
Don	26
Quixote’s	26
end	26
came,	26
after	26
he	26
had	26
received	26
all	26
the	26
sacraments,	26
and	26
had	26
in	26
full	26
and	26
forcible	26
terms	26
expressed	26
his	26
detestation	26
of	26
books	26
of	26
chivalry.	26
The	26
notary	26
was	26
there	26
at	26
the	26
time,	26
and	26
he	26
said	26
that	26
in	26
no	26
book	26
of	26
chivalry	26
had	26
he	26
ever	26
read	26
of	26
any	26
knight-errant	26
dying	26
in	26
his	26
bed	26
so	26
calmly	26
and	26
so	26
like	26
a	26
Christian	26
as	26
Don	26
Quixote,	26
who	26
amid	26
the	26
tears	26
and	26
lamentations	26
of	26
all	26
present	26
yielded	26
up	26
his	26
spirit,	26
that	26
is	26
to	26
say	26
died.	26
On	26
perceiving	26
it	26
the	26
curate	26
begged	26
the	26
notary	26
to	26
bear	26
witness	26
that	26
Alonso	26
Quixano	26
the	26
Good,	26
commonly	26
called	26
Don	26
Quixote	26
of	26
La	26
Mancha,	26
had	26
passed	26
away	26
from	26
this	26
present	26
life,	26
and	26
died	26
naturally;	26
and	26
said	26
he	26
desired	26
this	26
testimony	26
in	26
order	26
to	26
remove	26
the	26
possibility	26
of	26
any	26
other	26
author	26
save	26
Cide	26
Hamete	26
Benengeli	26
bringing	26
him	26
to	26
life	26
again	26
falsely	26
and	26
making	26
interminable	26
stories	26
out	26
of	26
his	26
achievements.	26
Such	26
was	26
the	26
end	26
of	26
the	26
Ingenious	26
Gentleman	26
of	26
La	26
Mancha,	26
whose	26
village	26
Cide	26
Hamete	26
would	26
not	26
indicate	26
precisely,	26
in	26
order	26
to	26
leave	26
all	26
the	26
towns	26
and	26
villages	26
of	26
La	26
Mancha	26
to	26
contend	26
among	26
themselves	26
for	26
the	26
right	26
to	26
adopt	26
him	26
and	26
claim	26
him	26
as	26
a	26
son,	26
as	26
the	26
seven	26
cities	26
of	26
Greece	26
contended	26
for	26
Homer.	26
The	26
lamentations	26
of	26
Sancho	26
and	26
the	26
niece	26
and	26
housekeeper	26
are	26
omitted	26
here,	26
as	26
well	26
as	26
the	26
new	26
epitaphs	26
upon	26
his	26
tomb;	26
Samson	26
Carrasco,	26
however,	26
put	26
the	26
following	26
lines:	26
A	26
doughty	26
gentleman	26
lies	26
here;	26
A	26
stranger	26
all	26
his	26
life	26
to	26
fear;	26
Nor	26
in	26
his	26
death	26
could	26
Death	26
prevail,	26
In	26
that	26
last	26
hour,	26
to	26
make	26
him	26
quail.	26
He	26
for	26
the	26
world	26
but	26
little	26
cared;	26
And	26
at	26
his	26
feats	26
the	26
world	26
was	26
scared;	26
A	26
crazy	26
man	26
his	26
life	26
he	26
passed,	26
But	26
in	26
his	26
senses	26
died	26
at	26
last.	26
And	26
said	26
most	26
sage	26
Cide	26
Hamete	26
to	26
his	26
pen,	26
“Rest	26
here,	26
hung	26
up	26
by	26
this	26
brass	26
wire,	26
upon	26
this	26
shelf,	26
O	26
my	26
pen,	26
whether	26
of	26
skilful	26
make	26
or	26
clumsy	26
cut	26
I	26
know	26
not;	26
here	26
shalt	26
thou	26
remain	26
long	26
ages	26
hence,	26
unless	26
presumptuous	26
or	26
malignant	26
story-tellers	26
take	26
thee	26
down	26
to	26
profane	26
thee.	26
But	26
ere	26
they	26
touch	26
thee	26
warn	26
them,	26
and,	26
as	26
best	26
thou	26
canst,	26
say	26
to	26
them:	26
Hold	26
off!	26
ye	26
weaklings;	26
hold	26
your	26
hands!	26
Adventure	26
it	26
let	26
none,	26
For	26
this	26
emprise,	26
my	26
lord	26
the	26
king,	26
Was	26
meant	26
for	26
me	26
alone.	26
For	26
me	26
alone	26
was	26
Don	26
Quixote	26
born,	26
and	26
I	26
for	26
him;	26
it	26
was	26
his	26
to	26
act,	26
mine	26
to	26
write;	26
we	26
two	26
together	26
make	26
but	26
one,	26
notwithstanding	26
and	26
in	26
spite	26
of	26
that	26
pretended	26
Tordesillesque	26
writer	26
who	26
has	26
ventured	26
or	26
would	26
venture	26
with	26
his	26
great,	26
coarse,	26
ill-trimmed	26
ostrich	26
quill	26
to	26
write	26
the	26
achievements	26
of	26
my	26
valiant	26
knight;—no	26
burden	26
for	26
his	26
shoulders,	26
nor	26
subject	26
for	26
his	26
frozen	26
wit:	26
whom,	26
if	26
perchance	26
thou	26
shouldst	26
come	26
to	26
know	26
him,	26
thou	26
shalt	26
warn	26
to	26
leave	26
at	26
rest	26
where	26
they	26
lie	26
the	26
weary	26
mouldering	26
bones	26
of	26
Don	26
Quixote,	26
and	26
not	26
to	26
attempt	26
to	26
carry	26
him	26
off,	26
in	26
opposition	26
to	26
all	26
the	26
privileges	26
of	26
death,	26
to	26
Old	26
Castile,	26
making	26
him	26
rise	26
from	26
the	26
grave	26
where	26
in	26
reality	26
and	26
truth	26
he	26
lies	26
stretched	26
at	26
full	26
length,	26
powerless	26
to	26
make	26
any	26
third	26
expedition	26
or	26
new	26
sally;	26
for	26
the	26
two	26
that	26
he	26
has	26
already	26
made,	26
so	26
much	26
to	26
the	26
enjoyment	26
and	26
approval	26
of	26
everybody	26
to	26
whom	26
they	26
have	26
become	26
known,	26
in	26
this	26
as	26
well	26
as	26
in	26
foreign	26
countries,	26
are	26
quite	26
sufficient	26
for	26
the	26
purpose	26
of	26
turning	26
into	26
ridicule	26
the	26
whole	26
of	26
those	26
made	26
by	26
the	26
whole	26
set	26
of	26
the	26
knights-errant;	26
and	26
so	26
doing	26
shalt	26
thou	26
discharge	26
thy	26
Christian	26
calling,	26
giving	26
good	26
counsel	26
to	26
one	26
that	26
bears	26
ill-will	26
to	26
thee.	26
And	26
I	26
shall	26
remain	26
satisfied,	26
and	26
proud	26
to	26
have	26
been	26
the	26
first	26
who	26
has	26
ever	26
enjoyed	26
the	26
fruit	26
of	26
his	26
writings	26
as	26
fully	26
as	26
he	26
could	26
desire;	26
for	26
my	26
desire	26
has	26
been	26
no	26
other	26
than	26
to	26
deliver	26
over	26
to	26
the	26
detestation	26
of	26
mankind	26
the	26
false	26
and	26

Professor	26
Michael	26
S.	26
Hart	26
was	26
the	26
originator	26
of	26
the	26
Project	26
Gutenberg-tm	26
concept	26
of	26
a	26
library	26
of	26
electronic	26
works	26
that	26
could	26
be	26
freely	26
shared	26
with	26
anyone.	26
For	26
forty	26
years,	26
he	26
produced	26
and	26
distributed	26
Project	26
Gutenberg-tm	26
eBooks	26
with	26
only	26
a	26
loose	26
network	26
of	26
volunteer	26
support.	26
Project	26
Gutenberg-tm	26
eBooks	26
are	26
often	26
created	26
from	26
several	26
printed	26
editions,	26
all	26
of	26
which	26
are	26
confirmed	26
as	26
not	26
protected	26
by	26
copyright	26
in	26
the	26
U.S.	26
unless	26
a	26
copyright	26
notice	26
is	26
included.	26
Thus,	26
we	26
do	26
not	26
necessarily	26
keep	26
eBooks	26
in	26
compliance	26
with	26
any	26
particular	26
paper	26
edition.	26
